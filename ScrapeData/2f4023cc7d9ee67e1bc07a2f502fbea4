Because (the soul) when it will depart is such; thus Au _d_ ulomi thinks.\n\nIt is wrong to maintain that the designation of Brahman by means of terms\ndenoting the individual soul is intended to prove the truth of the declaration\nthat through the knowledge of one thing everything is known, in so far namely\nas the soul is an effect of Brahman and hence one with it. For scriptural\ntexts such as 'the knowing Self is not born, it dies not' (Ka. Up. I, 2, 18),\ndeclare the soul not to have originated, and it moreover is admitted that the\nworld is each time created to the end of the souls undergoing experiences\nretributive of their former deeds; otherwise the inequalities of the different\nparts of the creation would be inexplicable. If moreover the soul were a mere\neffect of Brahman, its Release would consist in a mere return into the\nsubstance of Brahman,--analogous to the refunding into Brahman of the material\nelements, and that would mean that the injunction and performance of acts\nleading to such Release would be purportless. Release, understood in that\nsense, moreover would not be anything beneficial to man; for to be refunded\ninto Brahman as an earthen vessel is refunded into its own causal substance,\ni.e. clay, means nothing else but complete annihilation. How, under these\ncircumstances, certain texts can speak of the origination and reabsorption of\nthe individual soul will be set forth later on.--According to the opinion of\nthe teacher Au _d_ ulomi, the highest Selfs being denoted by terms directly\ndenoting the individual soul is due to the soul's becoming Brahman when\ndeparting from the body. This is in agreement with texts such as the\nfollowing, 'This serene being having risen from this body and approached the\nhighest light appears in its true form' (K _h_. Up. VIII, 3, 4); 'As the\nflowing rivers disappear in the sea, losing their name and form, thus a wise\nman freed from name and form goes to the divine Person who is higher than the\nhigh' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 8).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 22. On account of Brahman's abiding within the individual\nsoul...](sbe48164.htm)\n\n"
