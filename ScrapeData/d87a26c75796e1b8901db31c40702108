With hands uplifted and eyes fixed on the sun,\nhe performed a severe \xe1\xb9\xacapas (or religious austerity). At the end of a thousand\ndays, the Lord \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81yanya Muni, a knower of \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, who was like fire without\nsmoke, and who was as a scorching fire with his \xe1\xb9\xacejas (spiritual lustre)\napproached (him) and addressed the King thus: "Rise, rise and choose a boon."\nThe King prostrated before him and said: "O Lord, I am not an \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadmavi\xe1\xb9\xad (or\nknower of \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81). Thou art a \xe1\xb9\xaca\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadwavit, we hear. Please enlighten me about\nSa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva (the state of Sa\xe1\xb9\xad or Brahman)." (To which) the Muni replied thus: "O\nthou that art born of the race of Ikshw\xc4\x81ku: To begin with, your question is\ndifficult (of explanation): do not question me. Ask for any other thing you\ndesire." Thereupon the King touched the feet of \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81yanya and recited the\n(following) verse:\n\n"What is the use of these to me or any other? Oceans dry up. Mountains sink\ndown. The positions of \xe1\xb8\x8chruva (the Polar Star) and of trees change. Earth is\ndrowned. The Suras (angels) run away, leaving their (respective) places.\n(While such is the case), I am He in reality. Therefore of what avail to me is\nthe gratification of desires, since one who clings to the gratification of\ndesires is found to return again and again to this Sams\xc4\x81ra (mundane\nexistence)? Thou art able to extricate me (out of this Sams\xc4\x81ra). I am drowned\nlike a frog in a dry well. Thou art my refuge.\n\np. 25\n\n"O Lord! this body was the result of sexual intercourse. It is without wisdom;\nit is hell (itself). It came out through the urinary orifice. It is linked\ntogether by bones. It is coated over with flesh. It is bound by skin. It is\nreplete with faeces, urine, V\xc4\x81yu (air), bile, phlegm, marrow, fat, serum and\nmany other impurities. O Lord! to me in such a foul body (as this), thou art\nmy refuge."\n\nThereupon Lord \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81yanya was pleased and addressed the King thus: "O Mah\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ja,\nB\xe1\xb9\x9bha\xe1\xb8\x8drat\xe1\xb8\xa5a, the flag of the Ikshw\xc4\x81ku race, thou art an \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadmaj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81n\xc4\xab. Thou art one\nthat has done his duty. Thou art famous by the name of Maru\xe1\xb9\xad." At which the\nKing asked: "O Lord! in what way, can you describe \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81?" To which he replied\nthus: "Sound, touch, and others which seem to be Ar\xe1\xb9\xadha (wealth) are in fact\nAnar\xe1\xb9\xadha (evil). The Bh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 (the lower Self) clinging to these, never\nremembers the Supreme Seat. Through \xe1\xb9\xacapas, Sa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadwa (quality) is acquired;\nthrough Sa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadwa, a (pure) mind is acquired; and through mind, (Parama-) \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81,\n(the higher Self) is reached. Through attaining \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, one gets liberation.\nJust as fire without fuel is absorbed into its own womb, so Chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada (thought)\nthrough the destruction of its modifications is absorbed into its own womb\n(source). To a mind that has attained quiescence and truth, and which is not\naffected by sense-objects, the events that occur to it through the bondage of\nKarma are merely unreal. It is Chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada alone that is Sams\xc4\x81ra. It should be\ncleansed with effort. Whatever his Chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada (thinks), of that nature he becomes.\nThis is an archaic mystery. With the purifying of Chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada, one makes both good\nand bad Karmas to perish. One whose mind is thus cleansed attains the\nindestructible Bliss (through his own Self). Just as Chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada becomes united\nwith an object that comes across it, so why should not one (be released) from\nbondage, when one is united with Brahman. One should meditate in the middle of\nthe lotus of the heart, Parame\xc5\x9bwara (the highest Lord) who is the witness to\nthe play of Bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi, who is the object of supreme love, who is beyond the reach\nof mind and speech, who has no beginning or end, who is Sa\xe1\xb9\xad alone being of the\nnature of light only, who is beyond meditation, who can\n\np. 26\n\nneither be given up nor grasped (by the mind), who is without equal or\nsuperior, who is the permanent, who is of unshaken depth, who is without light\nor darkness, who is all-pervading, changeless and vehicleless, and who is\nwisdom of the nature of Moksha (salvation). I am He--that Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 who is the\neternal, the pure, the liberated, of the nature of wisdom, the true, the\nsubtle, the all-pervading, the secondless, the ocean of bliss, and one that is\nsuperior to Pra\xe1\xb9\xadyag\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 (the lower Self). There is no doubt about it. How will\ncalamity (or bondage) approach me who am depending upon my own bliss in my\nheart, who have put to shame the ghost of desires, who look upon this universe\nas (but) a jugglery and who am not associated with anything. The ignorant with\ntheir observance of the castes and orders of life obtain their fruits\naccording to their Karmas. Men who have given up all duties of castes, etc.,\nrest content in the bliss of their own Self. The distinctions of caste and\norders of life have divisions among them, have beginning and end, and are very\npainful. Therefore having given up all identification with sons and as well as\nbody, one should dwell in that endless and most supreme Bliss."\n\n##### A\xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81ya II\n\nThen Lord Mai\xe1\xb9\xadreya went to Kailas and having reached it asked Him thus: "O\nLord! please initiate me into the mysteries of the highest \xe1\xb9\xaca\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadwa." To which\nMah\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8deva replied: "The body is said to be a temple. The J\xc4\xabva in it is \xc5\x9aiva\nalone. Having given up all the cast-off offerings of Aj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, one should\nworship Him with So\'ham (I am He). The cognition of everything as non-\ndifferent from oneself is J\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na (wisdom). Abstracting the mind from sensual\nobjects is \xe1\xb8\x8chy\xc4\x81na (meditation). Purifying the mind of its impurities is Sn\xc4\x81na\n(bathing). The subjugation of the In\xe1\xb8\x8driyas (sensual organs) is \xc5\x9aaucha\n(purification). One should drink the nectar of Brahman and beg food for\nmaintaining the body. Having one (thought) alone, he should live in a solitary\nplace without a second. The wise man should observe thus: then be obtains\nAbsolution.\n\n"This body is subject to birth and death. It is of the nature of the secretion\nof the father and mother. It is impure,\n\np. 27\n\nbeing the seat of happiness and misery. (Therefore) bathing is prescribed for\ntouching it. It is bound by the \xe1\xb8\x8ch\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadus (skin, blood, etc.), is liable to\nsevere diseases, is a house of sins, is impermanent and is of changing\nappearance and size. (Therefore) bathing is prescribed for touching it. Foul\nmatter is naturally oozing out always from the nine holes. It (body) contains\nbad odour and foul excrement. (Therefore) bathing is prescribed for touching\nit. It is connected (or tainted) with the child-birth impurity of the mother\nand is born with it. It is also tainted with death impurity. (Therefore)\nbathing is prescribed for touching it. (The conception of) "I and mine" is the\nodour arising from the besmeared dung and urine. The release from it is spoken\nof as the perfect purification. The (external) purification by means of water\nand earth is on account of the worldly. The destruction of the threefold\naffinities (of \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81s\xe1\xb9\xadras, world and body) generates the purity for cleansing\nChi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada. That is called the (real) purification which is done by means of the\nearth and water of J\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na (wisdom) and Vair\xc4\x81gya (indifference to objects).\n\n"The conception of A\xe1\xb8\x8dwai\xe1\xb9\xada (non-dualism) should be taken in as the Bhiksha\n(alms-food); (but) the conception of \xe1\xb8\x8cwai\xe1\xb9\xada (dualism) should not be taken in.\nTo a Sanny\xc4\x81s\xc4\xab (ascetic), Bhiksha is ordained as dictated by the \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81s\xe1\xb9\xadra and the\nGuru. After becoming a Sanny\xc4\x81s\xc4\xab, a learned man should himself abandon his\nnative place and live at a distance, like a thief released from prison. When a\nperson gives up Aha\xe1\xb9\x85k\xc4\x81ra (I-am-ness) the son, wealth the brother, delusion the\nhouse, and desire the wife, there is no doubt that he is an emancipated\nperson. Delusion, the mother is dead. Wisdom, the son is born. In this manner\nwhile two kinds of pollution have occurred, how shall we (the ascetics)\nobserve the San\xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81s (conjunction periods)? The Chi\xe1\xb9\xad (consciousness) of the\nsun is ever shining in the resplendent \xc4\x80k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b of the heart. He neither sets nor\nrises; while so, how shall we perform the San\xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81s? Ek\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada (solitude) is that\nstate of one without second as determined by the words of a Guru. Monasteries\nor forests are not solitudes. Emancipation is only for those who do not doubt.\nTo those who doubt, there\n\np. 28\n\nis no salvation even after many births. Therefore one should attain faith.\n(Mere) abandoning of the Karmas or of the Man\xe1\xb9\xadras uttered at the initiation of\na Sanny\xc4\x81s\xc4\xab (ascetic) will not constitute Sanny\xc4\x81sa. The union of J\xc4\xabva (-\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81)\n(the lower Self) and Parama (-\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81) (the higher Self) at the two San\xe1\xb8\x8dhis\n(morning and evening) is termed Sanny\xc4\x81sa. Whoever has a nausea for all \xc4\xaasha\xe1\xb9\x87a\n(desires) and the rest as for vomited food, and is devoid of all affection for\nthe body, is qualified for Sanny\xc4\x81sa. At the moment when indifference towards\nall objects arises in the mind, a learned person may take up Sanny\xc4\x81sa.\nOtherwise, he is a fallen person. Whoever becomes a Sanny\xc4\x81s\xc4\xab on account of\nwealth, food, clothes and fame, becomes fallen in both (as a Sanny\xc4\x81s\xc4\xab and as\n[householder](errata.htm#4)); (then) he is not worthy of salvation.\n\n"The thought of (contemplation upon) \xe1\xb9\xaca\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadwas is the transcendental one; that\nof the \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81s\xe1\xb9\xadras, the middling, and that of Man\xe1\xb9\xadras, the lowest. The delusion of\npilgrimages is the lowest of the lowest. Like one, who, having seen in water\nthe reflection of fruits in the branches of trees, tastes and enjoys them, the\nignorant without self-cognition are in vain overjoyed with (as if they\nreached) Brahman. That ascetic is an emancipated person who does not abandon\nthe internal alms-taking ( _viz_., the meditation upon the non-dual),\ngenerating Vair\xc4\x81gya as well as faith the wife, and wisdom the son. Those men\n(termed) great through wealth, age, and knowledge, are only servants to those\nthat are great through their wisdom as also to their disciples. Those whose\nminds are deluded by My M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81, however learned they may be, do not attain Me,\nthe all-full \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, and roam about like crows, simply for the purpose of\nfilling up their belly, well burnt up (by hunger, etc.). For one that longs\nafter salvation, the worship of images made of stone, metals, gem, or earth,\nis productive of rebirth and enjoyment. Therefore the ascetic should perform\nhis own heart-worship alone, and relinquish external worship in order that he\nmay not be born again. Then like a vessel full to its brim in an ocean, he is\nfull within and full without. Like a vessel void in the ether, he is void\nwithin and void without. Do not become (or\n\np. 29\n\ndifferentiate between) the \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 that knows or the \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 that is known. Do\nbecome of the form of that which remains, after having given up all thoughts.\nRelinquishing with their V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s the seer, the seen and the visual, worship\n\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 alone, the resplendent supreme presence. That is the real supreme State\nwherein all Sa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpas (thoughts) are at rest, which resembles the state of a\nstone, and which is neither waking nor sleeping."\n\n##### A\xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81ya III\n\n"I am "I" (the Self). I am also another (the not-Self). I am Brahman. I am the\nSource (of all things). I am also the Guru of all worlds. I am of all the\nworlds. I am He. I am Myself alone. I am Si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dha. I am the Pure. I am the\nSupreme. I am. I am always He. I am the Eternal. I am stainless. I am Vij\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na.\nI am the Excellent. I am Soma. I am the All. I am without honour or dishonour.\nI am without Gu\xe1\xb9\x87as (qualities). I am \xc5\x9aiva (the auspicious). I am neither dual\nor non-dual. I am without the dualities (of heat or cold, etc.) I am He. I am\nneither existence nor non-existence. I am without language. I am the Shining.\nI am the Glory of void and non-void. I am the good and the bad. I am\nHappiness. I am without grief. I am Chai\xe1\xb9\xadanya. I am equal (in all). I am the\nlike and the non-like. I am the eternal, the pure, and the ever felicitous. I\nam without all and without not all. I am S\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadwika. I am always existing. I am\nwithout the number one. I am without the number two. I am without the\ndifference of Sa\xe1\xb9\xad and Asa\xe1\xb9\xad. I am without Sa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpa. I am without the difference\nof manyness. I am the form of immeasurable Bliss. I am one that exists not. I\nam the one that is not another. I am without body, etc. I am with asylum. I am\nwithout asylum. I am without support. I am without bondage or emancipation. I\nam the pure Brahman. I am He. I am without Chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada, etc. I am the supreme and\nthe Supreme of the supreme. I am ever of the form of deliberation and yet am\nwithout deliberation. I am He. I am of the nature of the Ak\xc4\x81ra and Uk\xc4\x81ra as\nalso of Mak\xc4\x81ra. I am the earliest. The contemplator and contemplation I am\nwithout. I am One that cannot be contemplated upon. I\n\np. 30\n\nam He. I have full form in all. I have the characteristics of Sachchi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81nan\xe1\xb8\x8da.\nI am of the form of places of pilgrimages. I am the higher Self and \xc5\x9aiva. I am\nneither the thing defined nor non-defined. I am the non-absorbed Essence. I am\nnot the measurer, the measure or the measured. I am \xc5\x9aiva. I am not the\nuniverse. I am the Seer of all. I am without the eyes, etc. I am the full\ngrown. I am the Wise. I am the Quiescent. I am the Destroyer. I am without any\nsensual organs. I am the doer of all actions. I am One that is content with\nall Ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xadas (either books or \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadmic Wisdom). I am the easily attainable. I\nhave the name of one that is pleased as well as one that is not. I am the\nfruits of all silence. I am always of the form of Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra (Absolute\nConsciousness). I am always Sa\xe1\xb9\xad (Be-ness) and Chi\xe1\xb9\xad (Consciousness). I am one\nthat has not anything in the least. I am not one that has not anything in the\nleast. I am without the heart-Gra\xe1\xb9\x87thi (knot). I am the Being in the middle of\nthe lotus. I am without the six changes. I am without the six sheaths and\nwithout the six enemies. I am within the within. I am without place and time.\nI am of the form of happiness having the quarters as My garment. I am the\nemancipated One, without bondage. I am without the "no". I am of the form of\nthe part-less. I am the partless. I have Chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada, though released from the\nuniverse. I am without the universe. I am of the form of all light. I am the\nLight (Jyo\xe1\xb9\xadis) in Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra (Absolute Consciousness). I am free from the three\nperiods (of time past, present, and future). I am without desires. I am\nwithout body. I am One that has no body. I am Gu\xe1\xb9\x87aless. I am alone. I am\nwithout emancipation. I am the emancipated One. I am ever without\nemancipation. I am without truth or untruth. I am always One that is not\ndifferent from Sa\xe1\xb9\xad (Be-ness). I have no place to travel. I have no going, etc.\nI am always of the same form. I am the Quiescent. I am Purusho\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadama (the Lord\nof Souls). There is no doubt that he who has realised himself thus, is Myself.\nWhoever hears (this) once becomes himself Brahman, yea, he becomes himself\nBrahman. Thus is the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 5. Kaivalya-Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d of K\xe1\xb9\x9bsh\xe1\xb9\x87a-Yajurve\xe1\xb8\x8da](tmu07.htm)\n\n'
