Let a prudent king try to find them out.\n\n* 2. Open rogues are those who forge measures and weights, receivers of bribes, robbers, gamblers, public prostitutes,\n\n* 3. Those who walk in disguise, those who live by teaching the performance of auspicious ceremonies, these and such like persons are considered open rogues.\n\n* 4. Rogues acting in secret are those who roam in the wood, or lie concealed, as well as those who make a profession of stealing. They attack and rob (those who do not beware of them).\n\n5\\. Those who infest a country, a village, or a house, or disturb a\nsacrificial act, cut-purses, and\n\np. 224\n\nother persons of this sort have to be considered as concealed rogues also.\n\n* 6. Blameless persons with whom the stolen goods are not found must not be chastised as robbers by the king; but let him quickly punish those robbers as guilty of theft with whom the stolen goods have been found.\n\n* 7. Those (rogues) who ravage in their own country, and those who disturb sacrificial acts, he shall strip of their entire wealth and rebuke them severely.\n\n* 8. Those on whom the stolen goods have not been seized he must examine, when they have been arrested from suspicion. Their fear having been excited, they will give evidence, through anxiety, in accordance with the facts of the case.\n\n* 9. 9 Questions shall be proposed to them antithetically with regard to place, time, region, their caste, their name, their dwelling, and their occupation, in case they happen to be workmen.\n\n* 10. 10 When the face changes colour or the voice falters, or the features look suspicious, when they do not give evidence in public, when they make impossible statements as to place and time, when there exists a doubt as to their place of residence,\n\n* 11. When they indulge in expense for bad purposes, when they have been previously convicted of larceny, when they keep bad company, or when documents speak against them, (by all such circumstances)\n\np. 225\n\nthey may be discovered (to be thieves), not by the possession of the stolen\ngoods alone.\n\n* 12. 12 When a ruffian or robber becomes suspected, and (the judge) has found out circumstantial evidence (which speaks against him), he shall be caused to make an oath.\n\n* 13. 13 Those who give food to thieves, as well as those who supply them with fire or water, or who give shelter, or show the way to them, or make their defence,\n\n* 14. Or who buy their goods, or receive (their goods), are held to be equally punishable as they, and so are those who conceal them.\n\n15. 15 Those who in a principality are the governors of that principality, and the neighbours called in (to watch over the safety of life and property) are (reckoned as) equal to thieves, when they stand neutral during the attack (of robbers).\n\n* 16. 16 He on whose ground a robbery has been committed, must trace the thieves to the best of his power, or else he must make good what has been stolen, unless the footmarks can be traced from that ground (into another man's ground).\n\n17. 17 When the footmarks, after leaving that ground, are lost and cannot be traced any further, the neighbours, inspectors of the road, and governors of that region shall be made responsible for the loss.\n\np. 226\n\n18\\. When a house has been plundered, the king shall cause the thief-catchers,\nthe guards, and the inhabitants of that kingdom to make good the loss, when\nthe thief is not caught.\n\n19. 19 Or, if he is a wicked man and there exists a doubt as to (whether) the robbery (was actually committed or not), the person (alleged to have been) robbed shall be caused to make an oath regarding the robbery, to clear himself (from suspicion).\n\n20\\. When another person than the thief has been accused of robbery and has\nbeen declared thief, because he is unable to prove his innocence, he shall be\npaid twice as much (as has been stolen), after the (real) thief has been\ndetected.\n\n21\\. When a man has obtained property stolen by a thief, he must restore it in\nits pristine shape; if it be no longer in existence, he must make good its\nvalue, and must be made to pay a fine to the same amount.\n\n* 22. 22 For stealing wood, cane, grass and the like, (utensils) made of clay, bamboo, utensils made of bamboo, rattan, bone, leather,\n\n* 23. Vegetables, green roots, grass or flowers, cow-milk, molasses, salt, or oil,\n\n* 24. Cooked food (and other) prepared food, spirituous liquor, flesh, and every sort of objects of small value\xc2\x97(for stealing any of these) a fine five times the value (of the article stolen should be paid).\n\n* 25. 25 (For stealing) any articles sold by weight or measure or tale, the fine shall be eight times their amount, in case they are very valuable.\n\np. 227\n\n26. 26 Corporal punishment (or death) shall be inflicted on him who steals more than ten Kumbhas of grain; where the amount is less, he shall be made to pay eleven times as much. Thus Manu has declared.\n\n* 27. 27 (For stealing) more than a hundred (Palas\xc2\x92 worth) of gold, silver, or other (precious metals), or the finest clothes, or very precious gems, corporal punishment (or death shall be inflicted).\n\n28\\. He who steals a man shall have to pay the highest fine; he who steals a\nwoman (shall be stripped) of his entire wealth; and he who steals a maiden\n(shall suffer) corporal punishment.\n\n* 29. 29 On him who forcibly seizes large domestic animals, the highest fine shall be inflicted; the middlemost amercement on him who takes cattle of middle size; and the smallest fine on him who steals small cattle.\n\n30. 30 The first (or lowest) fine to be inflicted on a guilty person shall amount to neither more nor less than twenty-four (Pa _n_ as). The middlemost fine shall consist of not more than four hundred, and not less than two hundred (Pa _n_ as).\n\n31\\. The highest fine should be known to consist of not more than a thousand,\nand not less than five hundred (Pa _n_ as). This is the threefold gradation of\npunishment, which has been proposed by the Self-Existent for robberies.\n\np. 228\n\n* 32. 32 (When the offence has been committed) for the first time, cut-purses shall have their (little) finger and thumb cut off. (When it has been committed) for the second time, the first fine shall be levied on them.\n\n* 33. 33 For (stealing) cows belonging to a Brahman, for piercing (the nostrils of) a barren cow, and for stealing a female slave, (the thief) shall in every case lose half his feet.\n\n34. 34 With whatever limb a thief acts among men, that very (limb) shall be taken from him, this is a law enacted by Manu.\n\n35\\. Let him inflict a specially heavy punishment on a specially criminal\nthief, or (a lighter one) on one whose offence is less heavy. But let him not\n(punish an habitual thief) in the same way as for the first offence.\n\n36. 36 Manu, the son of the Self-Existent, has declared ten places of punishment, which should be (selected) in (punishing members of the) three (lower) castes; a Brahman should remain uninjured always.\n\n37\\. (Those places are) the privy parts, the belly, the tongue, the two hands,\nand, fifthly, the two feet; as well as the eye, the nose, the two ears, the\nproperty, and the body.\n\np. 229\n\n38. 38 After carefully considering the (nature of the) offence, the place and time, and after examining the ability (of the offender), and the motive (by which he was actuated), he shall inflict these punishments.\n\n39. 39 Neither for the purpose of gaining a friend (in him), nor for the acquisition of large wealth, must a wicked criminal be suffered to go free by the king. Thus Manu has declared.\n\n40. 40 By pardoning an offender, a king commits the same offence as by punishing an innocent man. Religious merit accrues to him from punishing (the wicked).\n\n41. 41 Let him not on any account kill a Brahman, though convicted of all possible crimes. He may at pleasure cause him to be banished, thus has the law been settled.\n\n42. 42 Let the king take his entire wealth from him or leave him a fourth part of it (only he must not take his life), remembering the law promulgated by the Creator. This is just.\n\n43. 43 For four offences of a Brahman, branding him is ordained (as punishment): for violating the bed of a Guru, for drinking spirituous liquor, for theft, and for hurting another Brahman.\n\n* 44. 44 For violating the bed of a Guru, (the brand of) a female part should be made; for drinking\n\np. 230\n\nspirituous liquor, (the brand of) a liquor sign is ordained; for theft, he\nshall make (the brand of) a dog's foot (on his forehead).\n\n45\\. The slayer of a Brahman shall have (the brand of) a headless man stamped\non his forehead, and it is forbidden to speak to him. This is a law enacted by\nManu.\n\n46. 46 A thief must approach the king with flying hair, running, and proclaiming his theft (with the words): 'Thus have I acted. Chastise me.'\n\n47\\. By so doing he is cleared from guilt, because he has confessed his deed;\nthe king, thereupon, shall touch him (with a club), or dismiss him, if he is\ninnocent.\n\n48. 48 Those men who have received a punishment from the king for an offence committed by them, proceed to heaven, free from sin, as (if they were) virtuous men who had acted well.\n\n49. 49 Whether he be punished or released, the thief is freed from his crime; if, however, the king does not punish him, the crime committed by the thief falls on (the king) himself.\n\n50\\. Self-possessed men are corrected by their Guru; wicked men are corrected\n(or punished) by the king; but those who have sinned in secret are corrected\nby Yama, the son of Vivasvat.\n\n51. 51 The crime of a _S_ udra in theft is eightfold (that of a man of the lowest caste) of a Vai _s_ ya, sixteenfold; and of a Kshatriya, thirty-twofold.\n\np. 231\n\n52. 52 Of a Brahman, sixty-fourfold; thus the son of the Self-Existent has declared. Knowledge makes a difference also. For knowing persons, (the punishment) is specially severe.\n\n* 53. 53 56 Punishment is pronounced to be twofold: corporal punishment and fines. Corporal punishment is again declared to be of ten sorts; fines are (also) of more than one kind.\n\n* 54. 54 Fines begin with a Kaka _n_ i, and the highest amount of a fine is one's entire property. Corporal punishment begins with confinement and ends with capital punishment.\n\n* 55. 'Fines beginning with a Kaka _n_ i' are declared to amount to no less than one Masha. Those are called 'fines amounting to no less than a Masha' which amount to one Karshapa _n_ a at most.\n\n* 56. 'Fines beginning with no less than a Karshapa _n_ a' are those amounting to no less than four Karshapa _n_ as; or which begin with two, and end with eight (Karshapa _n_ as); or which begin with three, and end with twelve (Karshapa _n_ as).\n\n* 57. 57 A Karshapa _n_ a is a silver coin in the southern country; in the east, it is an equivalent for (a certain number of) Pa _n_ as, and is equal to twenty Pa _n_ as.\n\np. 232\n\n* 58. A Masha should be known to be the twentieth part of a Karshapa _n_ a. A Kaka _n_ i is the fourth part of a Masha or Pala.\n\n59. 59 By that appellation which is in general use in the region of the Punjaub, the value of a Karshapa _n_ a is not circumscribed here.\n\n* 60. 60 A Karshapa _n_ a has to be taken as equal to an A _n_ _d_ ika; four of these are a Dhanaka; twelve of the latter are a Suvar _n_ a, which is called Dinara otherwise.\n\n61\\. Let the king practise the duties of his office, and (follow) the rule of\ninflicting punishment, faithful to the tenets (of the sacred law). Let him\ndestroy accordingly, as governor, the evil-doers, after having traced them by\nthe application of cunning stratagems and arrested them.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[223:1](sbe3350.htm#fr_673) This section is found in the Nepalese MS. only.\nSee Introduction. The reading of several passages is uncertain, and this\ncircumstance, taken together with the want of a Commentary, renders my\ntranslation less reliable than could be desired.\n\nAppendix. Theft. 1-4. Manu IX, 256-260. The technical terms have been\ntranslated in accordance with the glosses of Alarm's commentators, as given in\nthe notes to Professor Miler's translation. In par. 4, mushya _m_ seems to\nstand for mush _t_ ya _m_.\n\n[224:9](sbe3350.htm#fr_674) 'Antithetically' (vinigrahe), or 'when they have\nbeen arrested.'\n\n[224:10](sbe3350.htm#fr_675) 10, 11. A somewhat analogous description of the\nsigns by which a false witness may be found out, has been given previously: I,\n193-196.\n\n[225:12](sbe3350.htm#fr_676) The term le _s_ a has been rendered by\n'circumstantial evidence,' because it seems to be synonymous with yuktile _s_\na, I, 236.\n\n[225:13](sbe3350.htm#fr_677) 13, 14. Manu IX, 271, 278.\n\n[225:15](sbe3350.htm#fr_678) Nearly identical with Manu IX, 272.\n\n[225:16](sbe3350.htm#fr_679) The term go _k_ ara, translated 'ground,' may\ndenote the landed property or pasture ground of a whole village. See above,\nXIV, 22, 23.\n\n[225:17](sbe3350.htm#fr_680) See XIV, 24.\n\n[226:19](sbe3350.htm#fr_681) The senseless reading of the MS., dapyaka tesham,\nhas been conjecturally altered into doshakartaisha.\n\n[226:22](sbe3350.htm#fr_682) 22-24. Manu VIII, 326-329.\n\n[226:25](sbe3350.htm#fr_683) Manu VIII, 321.\n\n[227:26](sbe3350.htm#fr_684) Manu VIII, 320.\n\n[227:27](sbe3350.htm#fr_685) 27, 28. Manu VIII, 321, 323.\n\n[227:29](sbe3350.htm#fr_686) Manu VIII, 325.\n\n[227:30](sbe3350.htm#fr_687) 30, 37. The reading of these two paragraphs is\nquite uncertain. The rules laid down here apparently differ considerably from\nthe analogous rules of Manu (VIII, 758) and other legislators.\n\n[228:32](sbe3350.htm#fr_688) Manu IX, 277.\n\n[228:33](sbe3350.htm#fr_689) The parallel passage of Manu (VIII, 325) shows\nthat sthuraya _s_ _kh_ edana _m_ is the correct reading. For the three\ndifferent explanations of this term, which have been proposed by the\ncommentators of Manu, see the note to Professor Buhler's translation. The\ntranslation follows the interpretation proposed by Kulluka, Govindara _g_ a,\nand Raghavananda, which appears to be preferable to the others.\n\n[228:34](sbe3350.htm#fr_690) Nearly identical with Manu VIII, 334.\n\n[228:36](sbe3350.htm#fr_691) 36, 37. Nearly identical with Manu VIII, 124,\n125.\n\n[229:38](sbe3350.htm#fr_692) Manu VIII, 126.\n\n[229:39](sbe3350.htm#fr_693) Manu VIII, 347.\n\n[229:40](sbe3350.htm#fr_694) Nearly identical with Manu IX, 249.\n\n[229:41](sbe3350.htm#fr_695) Manu VIII, 380.\n\n[229:42](sbe3350.htm#fr_696) The third Pada of this paragraph has been\nconjecturally altered, as it cannot be made out in the MS.\n\n[229:43](sbe3350.htm#fr_697) Manu IX, 236.\n\n[229:44](sbe3350.htm#fr_698) 44, 45. Manu IX, 237. The last Pada in paragraph\n44 cannot be made out in the MS.\n\n[230:46](sbe3350.htm#fr_699) Nearly identical with Manu VIII, 314.\n\n[230:48](sbe3350.htm#fr_700) Identical with Manu VIII, 318.\n\n[230:49](sbe3350.htm#fr_701) Nearly identical with Manu VIII, 316.\n\n[230:51](sbe3350.htm#fr_702) Nearly identical with Manu VIII, 337.\n\n[231:52](sbe3350.htm#fr_703) Manu VIII, 338.\n\n[231:53](sbe3350.htm#fr_704) Manu VIII, 129. See too, above, paragraphs 36,\n37.\n\n[231:54](sbe3350.htm#fr_706) Kaka _n_ i or Kaki _n_ i is the name of a small\ncoin. See par. 58.\n\n[231:56](sbe3350.htm#fr_705) 53-56. This passage is quoted, in the Sm _ri_ ti\n_k_ andrika, with several different readings. One of them, in par. 55,\ndeserves special notice. For mashavara _h_ smata _h_ (read sm _ri_ ta _h_ ),\nthe Sm _ri_ ti _k_. reads mashapara _h_ sm _ri_ ta _h_ , 'are declared to\namount to no more than one Masha.' This is probably the correct reading.\n\n[231:57](sbe3350.htm#fr_707) According to Manu (VIII, 136), the Karshapa _n_ a\nis a copper coin. The reading of the second half of this paragraph is quite\nuncertain.\n\n[232:59](sbe3350.htm#fr_708) The term iha, 'here,' may be either referred to\nthe place of residence of the author of the Narada-sm _ri_ ti, or it may mean\n'in this work.'\n\n[232:60](sbe3350.htm#fr_709) An A _n_ _d_ ika is elsewhere reckoned at four\nYavas. In the Viramitrodaya and other works, this text is attributed to B _ri_\nhaspati. The coin called Dinara is the Roman denarius.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I. Judicial Procedure](sbe3351.htm)\n\n"
