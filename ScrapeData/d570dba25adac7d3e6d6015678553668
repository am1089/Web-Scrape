Learn\nwhat a preceptor told a pupil who went to him. Hearing it all, deliberate on\nit properly. Non-destruction of all creatures, that is deemed to be the\ngreatest duty 1. This is the highest seat 2, free from vexation and holy in\ncharacter. The ancients who perceived the established (truth) call knowledge\nthe highest happiness. Therefore by pure knowledge one is released from all\nsins. And those who are constantly engaged in destruction, and who are\ninfidels 3 in their conduct, and who entertain avarice and delusion, go verily\nto hell. Those who without sloth perform actions with expectations, rejoice in\nthis world, being born again and again. But those wise and talented men, who\nperform actions with faith, free from any connexion with expectations,\nperceive correctly 4. Now I will proceed to, state how the association and\ndissociation of Kshetra _g_ \xc3\xb1a and nature (take place). Learn that, O best (of\nmen)! The relation here is said to be that between the object and subject 5.\nThe subject\n\np. 379\n\nis always the being, and nature is stated to be the object. It has been\nexplained in the above mode, as (having the relation) of the gnat and the\nudumbara 1. Nature which is non-intelligent knows nothing, though it is the\nobject of enjoyment 2. Who enjoys and what is enjoyed 3 is learnt from the _S_\nastras. Nature is said always to abound in the pairs of opposites, and to be\nconstituted of the qualities; the Kshetra _g_ \xc3\xb1a is free from the pairs of\nopposites, devoid of parts, and in essence free from the qualities. He abides\nin everything alike 4, and is connected with (all) knowledge 5; and he always\nenjoys nature as a lotus-leaf (enjoys) water. Even brought into contact with\nall qualities, a learned man remains untainted 6. There is no doubt that the\nbeing is unattached just like the unsteady drop of water placed upon a lotus-\nleaf 7. It is established that nature is the property 8 of the being. And the\nrelation of the two is like that of matter and the maker 9. As one goes into\n(a) dark (place) taking a light (with him), so those who wish for the supreme\ngo with the light of nature 10. While there is oil\n\np. 380\n\nand wick 1, the light shines; but the flame is extinguished when the oil and\nwick are exhausted. Thus nature is perceived 2; the being is laid down (as\nbeing) unperceived. Understand this, O Brahma _n_ as! Well now, I will tell\nyou something more. One who has a bad understanding does not acquire knowledge\neven with a thousand (admonitions). And one who is possessed of knowledge\nenhances (his) happiness even with a fourth share 3. Thus should one\nunderstand the accomplishment of piety by (apt) means. For the talented man\nwho knows (these) means, attains supreme happiness 4. As a man travelling\nalong some way without provisions for the journey, travels with great\ndiscomfort, and may even be destroyed on the way, so should one understand,\nthat by action 5 the fruit is or is not produced. For a man to see within\n(his) self 6 what is agreeable and what is disagreeable to him is good. And as\none who is devoid of a perception of the truth rashly travels on foot by a\nlong way unseen before 7, while (another) goes by the same\n\np. 381\n\nway in a carriage 1 drawn by horses, and going swiftly, such is the progress\nof the men of understanding. Having climbed up a mountain one should not look\nat the surface of the earth 2. One sees a man travelling in a chariot, and\nvoid of intelligence, afflicted by reason of the chariot. As far as there is a\ncarriage-path, he goes in the carriage; where the carriage-path stops, a\nlearned man goes on abandoning the carriage. So travels the talented man, who\nunderstands the procedure respecting (knowledge of the) truth and devotion 3,\nand who knows about the qualities, comprehending the gradations 4 one above\nthe other. As one who without a boat dives into the ocean with his arms only,\nthrough delusion, undoubtedly wishes for destruction; while a wise man\nlikewise knowing distinctions 5 and having a boat with good oars, goes in the\nwater without fatigue, and soon crosses the reservoir, and having crossed (it)\ngoes to the other shore, throwing\n\np. 382\n\naside the boat, and devoid of (the thought that this or that is) mine. This\nhas been already explained by the parallel of the carriage and pedestrian. One\nwho has come by delusion through affection, adheres to that like a fisherman\nto his boat, being overcome by (the thought that this or that is) mine. It is\nnot possible to move on land after embarking in a boat. And likewise one\ncannot move in water after entering a carriage. Thus there are various actions\nin regard to different objects 1. And as action is performed in this world, so\ndoes it result to them 2. That which sages by their understanding meditate\nupon, which is void of any smell whatever, void of taste, and void of colour,\ntouch, or sound, that is called the Pradhana 3. Now that Pradhana is\nunperceived; a development of the unperceived is the Mahat; and a development\nof the Pradhana (when it is) become Mahat is egoism. From egoism is produced\nthe development, namely, the great elements; and of the elements respectively,\nobjects of sense are verily stated to be the development 4. The unperceived is\nof the nature of seed 5, and also productive in its essence. And we have heard\n\np. 383\n\nthat the great self is of the nature of seed and a product. Egoism is of the\nnature of seed and a product also again and again. And the five great elements\nare verily of the nature of seed and products. The objects of the five\nelements are of the nature of seed 1, but they do not yield products. Learn\nabout their properties. Now space has one quality, air is said to have two\nqualities; it is said that light has three qualities; and water, too, is of\nfour qualities; and earth, abounding with movables and immovables, the divine\nsource of all entities, full of examples of agreeable and disagreeable\n(things), should be understood to be of five qualities 2. Sound, touch, colour\nlikewise, taste, and smell as the fifth--these, O best of the twice-born!\nshould be understood to be the five qualities of earth. Smell always belongs\nto the earth 3; and smell is stated to be (of) numerous descriptions. I will\nstate at length the numerous qualities of smell 4. Smell is agreeable or\ndisagreeable, sweet, sour, and bitter likewise, diffusive and compact also,\nsoft, and rough, and clear also, 5\\--thus should\n\np. 384\n\nsmell, which belongs to the earth, be understood to be of ten descriptions.\nSound, touch, and colour likewise, and taste, are stated to be the qualities\nof water. I will now give (some) information about taste. Taste is stated to\nbe of numerous descriptions. Sweet 1, sour, bitter, sharp, astringent, and\nsaltish likewise-thus are the forms of taste, which is a development of water,\nsaid to be of six descriptions. Sound, touch, and likewise colour; thus is\nlight said to have three qualities. The quality of light is colour, and colour\nis stated to be of numerous descriptions. White, black, red likewise, green,\nyellow, and grey likewise, short long, narrow 2, broad, square, and circular-\nthus is the colour of light said to be of twelve forms. It should be\nunderstood 3 by aged Brahma _n_ as, who speak the truth, and are conversant\nwith piety. Sound and touch also should be understood; air is said to have\n(these) two qualities. And touch is the quality of air, and touch is stated to\nbe of numerous descriptions. Rough, cold and hot likewise, tender and clear\nalso, hard, glutinous, smooth, slippery, hurtful, and soft 4\\--thus the\nquality of air is properly said by Brahma _n_ as who have reached perfection,\nwho are conversant with piety and perceive the truth, to be of twelve\ndescriptions. Now space has one quality,\n\np. 385\n\nand that is stated to be sound only. I will speak at length of the numerous\nqualities of sound. Sha _dg_ a, _Ri_ shabha, together with Gandhara, Madhyama,\nand likewise Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ ama, and beyond. these should be understood to be Nishada\nand Dhaivata likewise [1](sbe0863.htm#fn_1994); agreeable and disagreeable\nsound also, compact, and of (many) ingredients [2](sbe0863.htm#fn_1995). Thus\nsound, which is produced in space, should be understood to be of ten\ndescriptions. Space is the highest element [3](sbe0863.htm#fn_1996), egoism is\nabove that; above egoism is understanding, and above that understanding is the\nself [4](sbe0863.htm#fn_1997); above that is the unperceived, and above the\nunperceived is the being. One who knows which is superior and inferior among\nentities, and who knows the proper procedure in all actions, and who\nidentifies himself with every being [5](sbe0863.htm#fn_1998), repairs to the\nimperishable self.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[378:1](sbe0862.htm#fr_1961) See [p. 291](sbe0840.htm#page_291) supra, and\nnote  [3](sbe0840.htm#fn_1407) there.\n\n[378:2](sbe0862.htm#fr_1962) So literally; the sense is--that which one is to\naim at.\n\n[378:3](sbe0862.htm#fr_1963) The original is nastika, the contrary of that\n'astikya,' which at Gita, [p. 126](sbe0820.htm#page_126), we have rendered by\n'belief (in a future world),' following _S_ ridhara. Ramanu _g_ a, whose\ncommentary came to hand too late for any other than a very occasional use in\nthe translation of the Gita, renders it by 'belief in the truth of the\nteaching of the Vedas'.\n\n[378:4](sbe0862.htm#fr_1964) I. e. learn the truth.\n\n[378:5](sbe0862.htm#fr_1965) I use the terms subject and object here in the\nphilosophical sense explained by Sir W. Hamilton, viz. the thinking agent and\nthe object of thought respectively. And cf. also the passage referred to in\nnote  3 on p. 379 infra.\n\n[379:1](sbe0862.htm#fr_1966) [p. 374](sbe0860.htm#page_374) supra. The\nrelation is one of close connexion, coupled with some identity of nature\n(because, says Nilaka _nth_ a, an entirely extraneous thing could not get into\nthe inside of the fruit, and the gnat's body therefore must have come from the\nfruit itself), but still the elements are distinct.\n\n[379:2](sbe0862.htm#fr_1967) See [p. 371](sbe0859.htm#page_371), supra, note\n[4](sbe0859.htm#fn_1915).\n\n[379:3](sbe0862.htm#fr_1968) Cf. Maitri, p. 109.\n\n[379:4](sbe0862.htm#fr_1969) Cf. Gita, pp. [105](sbe0815.htm#page_105),\n[106](sbe0815.htm#page_106).\n\n[379:5](sbe0862.htm#fr_1970) Knowledge of the Kshetra _g_ \xc3\xb1a forms part of all\nreal knowledge. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra's reading and interpretation are\ndifferent. He says, 'As he is seen coming to light everywhere alike, so,' &c.\n\n[379:6](sbe0862.htm#fr_1971) Cf. Gita, pp.\n[55](sbe0805.htm#page_55)-[110](sbe0816.htm#page_110).\n\n[379:7](sbe0862.htm#fr_1972) Again the common simile.\n\n[379:8](sbe0862.htm#fr_1973) The original is dravya, rendered 'matter' in the\nnext sentence. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra paraphrases it by 'upakarana,'\nparaphernalia.\n\n[379:9](sbe0862.htm#fr_1974) So the original, the sense is not clear. But see\n_S_ veta _s_ vatara, p. 368.\n\n[379:10](sbe0862.htm#fr_1975) Knowledge, which, says Nilaka _nth_ a, is a\nmanifestation of nature. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says the knowledge of the truth\nwhich the p. 380 self acquires is by means of nature. Cf. Sankhya-karika 56,\nand comment.\n\n[380:1](sbe0862.htm#fr_1976) So Nilaka _nth_ a. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra does not\ntake gu _n_ a here to mean 'wick.'\n\n[380:2](sbe0862.htm#fr_1977) I. e., I presume, in its manifestations; it is\nperceived for some time and then vanishes. Cf. Sa _n_ khya-karika 59-61; the\nPurusha is not 'perceived' in this sense.\n\n[380:3](sbe0862.htm#fr_1978) Viz. of admonition, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[380:4](sbe0862.htm#fr_1979) Cf. Gita, [p. 70](sbe0808.htm#page_70), where the\nsame phrase occurs.\n\n[380:5](sbe0862.htm#fr_1980) The fruit of this is uncertain; knowledge which\nis in one's self is the thing to be worked for.\n\n[380:6](sbe0862.htm#fr_1981) I. e. the mind, Nilaka _nth_ a. The meaning is,\nhe should not care for external pleasure and pain. Cf. Gita, inter alia, [p.\n50](sbe0804.htm#page_50).\n\n[380:7](sbe0862.htm#fr_1982) This seems to be so left imperfect in the\noriginal. The construction seems to be this: the progress of the latter is as\ngreat as that of one who drives in a chariot as compared with that of one who\ngoes on foot with much suffering. Cf. the construction on next page.\n\n[381:1](sbe0862.htm#fr_1983) I. e. the Sastras, says Nilaka _nth_ a. Cf. Gita,\n[p. 117](sbe0818.htm#page_117).\n\n[381:2](sbe0862.htm#fr_1984) When one has arrived at knowledge,--the highest\nseat, says Nilaka _nth_ a,--one need not perform the dictates of the Sastras,\nwhich are only preliminary to the acquisition of knowledge. Cf. Gita, pp.\n[48](sbe0804.htm#page_48), [73](sbe0808.htm#page_73). Cf. as to this figure of\nthe chariot and the next one about the boat, B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p. 695.\n\n[381:3](sbe0862.htm#fr_1985) I adopt Ar _g_ una's rendering of the original\nhere, viz. Yoga. The meaning, on that rendering, is the same as it is in the\nGita.\n\n[381:4](sbe0862.htm#fr_1986) According to Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, action with\ndesire, action without desire, and lastly, knowledge. According to Nilaka\n_nth_ a, action laid down in the _S_ astras, then Yoga, and then the condition\nof Ha _m_ sa, Paramaha _m_ sa, &c.\n\n[381:5](sbe0862.htm#fr_1987) Literally, one knowing divisions. I presume the\nmeaning is distinctions between various things as to which suits which, and so\nforth. The boat, says Nilaka _nth_ a, is a preceptor, and even a preceptor is\nnot to be sought for after a man has achieved Yoga; hence the text proceeds to\nspeak further on of casting aside the boat. Wishes for destruction = is sure\nto meet destruction.\n\n[382:1](sbe0862.htm#fr_1988) I. e. appertaining to the various orders of\nhouseholders, &c., Nilaka _nth_ a. But I am not aware of any authority for\nthis sense of vishaya.\n\n[382:2](sbe0862.htm#fr_1989) I. e. those who perform them.\n\n[382:3](sbe0862.htm#fr_1990) Nilaka _nth_ a says, 'Having stated above the\nmeans of knowledge, he now states the proper object of knowledge.'\n\n[382:4](sbe0862.htm#fr_1991) See [p. 332](sbe0852.htm#page_332) supra. The\noriginal for development is gu _n_ a, literally quality.\n\n[382:5](sbe0862.htm#fr_1992) The meaning of this passage seems to be identical\nwith that of Sa _n_ khya-karika 3\\. Productive (Prasavatmakam) is probably to\nbe explained as Prasavadharmi is at Sa _n_ khya-karika II (see commentary of\nVa _k_ aspati, pp. 59, 60), viz. always undergoing development. The great\nelements are of course the tanmatras.\n\n[383:1](sbe0862.htm#fr_1993) This is not clear, unless 'product' above means\nproductive, and seed means a product, it being a product of the a _n_ kura or\nsprout. Nilaka _nth_ a says, 'seed = cause; product = effect. The unperceived\nis an effect, and so the contrary doctrine of the Sa _n_ khya is here shown to\nbe wrong. The objects are causes, as their enjoyment causes an impression.'\n\n[383:2](sbe0862.htm#fr_1994) See pp. [285](sbe0839.htm#page_285),\n[286](sbe0839.htm#page_286) supra.\n\n[383:3](sbe0862.htm#fr_1995) That is to say, smell is the special property of\nthe earth only, the other qualities are common to it with the other elements.\nThe word in the original is guna or quality everywhere.\n\n[383:4](sbe0862.htm#fr_1996) See _S_ anti Parvan (Moksha Dharma), chap. 184,\nst. 27.\n\n[383:5](sbe0862.htm#fr_1997) Bitter, Nilaka _nth_ a exemplifies by the smell\nof the chili, apparently interpreting ka _t_ vi, as it may be interpreted, to\nmean sharp; diffusive = overcoming all other smells, like Asafoetida; compact\n= made up of many smells, Nilaka _nth_ a adds, that soft is like that of p.\n384 liquid ghee, rough of the oil of mustard, and clear as of cooked rice. The\n_S_ anti Parvan passage omits 'sour.'\n\n[384:1](sbe0862.htm#fr_1998) Cf. Gita, [p. 118](sbe0819.htm#page_118).\n\n[384:2](sbe0862.htm#fr_1999) Literally, lean and fat. These are rather unusual\nqualities to attribute to colour. The _S_ anti Parvan passage gives more.\n\n[384:3](sbe0862.htm#fr_2000) Sic. Does it mean 'it is understood?' Cf. Pa _n_\nini III, 3, 113.\n\n[384:4](sbe0862.htm#fr_2001) Tender = like the touch of a son, &c.; clear =\nlike that of an excellent cloth, Nilaka _nth_ a; glutinous = like that of oil,\nsmooth = like that of a gem; slippery = not really smooth, but appearing to be\nsuch, like that of saliva (?), Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra. The enumeration of these\nin the _S_ anti Parvan loc. cit. is again different.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXXVI](sbe0863.htm)\n\n"
