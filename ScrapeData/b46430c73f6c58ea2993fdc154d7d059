Our mode of progress consisted\nin riding or driving about twenty-five miles a day, from one of our Camps to\nthe next. We usually halted a day or two at each Camp, which admitted of a\ndouble march being taken by the Camp we had left behind us, and of its being\nready pitched on our arrival, two days' march in advance of where we had left\nit. The double Camps, with the elephant, camel, and mule drivers, grooms,\ntent-pitchers, cooks, and other servants, numbered, with the addition of the\nGovernor's Body-Guard, about six hundred souls. My mother being at the time\nabsent in England, I chanced to be the only Lady of the party. Anna Liberata\nde Souza, my native ayah, went with me.\n\nOur route from Poona, whence we started, lay through the district of Satara,\nwith its fort-crowned hill (where the Mahratta Chief Sivajee's sword\n'Bowanee,' given to him by Bowanee, the Goddess of Vengeance, is still shown),\nKurar, with its Buddhist caves; the Native State of Kolapore; where,\naccompanied by Mrs. Wilder, the wife of an American missionary, I visited the\nAka Sahib, and the Ranee in the Palace; Belgaum, with its beautiful fort and\nruined Jam temples, and Dharwar, near the scene of the battle of Ram Droogand,\nand where we saw the Nawab's cheetas hunting antelope on the level plains.\n\nFrom Dharwar we crossed the river Krishna, a matter of some difficulty--the\nelephants, horses, camels, mules, and bullocks swimming, the camp equipage\nbeing conveyed on rafts supported on jars or inflated skins, and my father and\nI, with two of his Staff, crossing in a circular coracle of wicker-work.\n\nFrom the further bank of the Krishna we rode across interminable plains of\nblack-soiled, cotton-growing country to the ruined Mahometan capital of\nBeejapore, the vast dome of whose great mosque (thirteen feet larger in\ndiameter than that of St. Paul's), is to be seen standing out clearly against\nthe sky hours before the city itself is reached. Of Beejapore--with its Motee\nMusjid (Pearl Mosque); its Soap-Stone Mosque; its big eleven ton brass gun,\ncast by a Turk in the sixteenth century, in which a grown-up person can sit\nupright; its wonderful Library (of which all that remained had been rescued\nfrom destruction by my father some twenty years before, and is now to be\nstudied by those that so will, in the India Office Library in Westminster);\nits shrine, where are shown the three hairs of Mahomet's beard, and its\nnumberless local traditions and legends of all kinds--this is not the place to\ntell\n\nFrom Beejapore we crossed the Bheema river, and went to Sholapore, whence we\nreturned to Poona by railway.\n\nSome record of the country we traversed is to be found in the Duke of\nWellington's Despatches, but much of its manifold interests and wild romantic\nhistory has never yet been said or sung. The glory of its works of art, the\ngrandeur of its scenery, the living interest of the faith and fortunes of its\npeople;--whose races represent all forms of Oriental barbarism and\ncivilisation, from the Bedhur whose sole sustenance is parched millet-seed, to\nthe wealthy Mahometan and Hindoo aristocracy and merchants of the great towns.\n\nAs there was no other lady in the Camp, and I sometimes had no lady visitors\nfor some days together, I was necessarily much alone.\n\nOne day, being tired of reading, writing, and sketching, I asked Anna, my\nconstant attendant, whose caste (the Lingaet) belonged to part of the country\nthat we were traversing, if she could not tell me a story? This she declared\nto be impossible. I said, 'You have children and grandchildren, surely you\ntell them stories to amuse them sometimes?' She then said she would try and\nremember one, such as she told her grandchildren, and which had been told her\nby her own grandmother when she was a child; and she told me the story of\n'Punchkin;' which was subsequently followed by the others that are here\nrecorded.\n\nWhilst narrating them she usually sat cross-legged on the floor, looking into\nspace, and repeating what she said as by an effort of memory.\n\nIf any one came into the room whilst she was speaking, or she were otherwise\ninterrupted during the narration, it was apparently impossible for her to\ngather up the thread of the narration where it had been dropped, and she had\nto begin afresh at the beginning of her story as at the commencement of some\nlong-forgotten melody. She had not, I believe, heard any of the stories after\nshe was eleven years old, when her grandmother had died.\n\nAs she told me a story I made notes of what she said, and then wrote it down\nand read it to her, to be certain that I had correctly given every detail. In\nthis manner all the stories that she could recollect were one by one recorded.\n\nThis book has been translated into the German, Hungarian, and portions of it\ninto the Danish language, and has been retranslated, I am told, into Mahratti,\nHindoostani, and Guzerati. It is strange that, owing to accident, though two\nexcellent French translations have been suggested, neither has yet been\npublished Professor Max Muller told me not long ago that he had come upon the\nSanskrit original (which he had not previously seen) of one of these stories,\nand that after the lapse of the many intervening centuries, the version of it,\nas recorded from Anna's narration, read like a direct translation from the\nnative Sanskrit.\n\nMARY FRERE.\n\nNovember 1881.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Introduction](odd02.htm)\n\n"
