The Sruva spoon (serves as) a vessel.\n\n2\\. According to the purpose the properties (of the different things to be\nused at each oblation) should be chosen.\n\n3 3. Taking up Ku _s_ a blades with the left, and the\n\np. 27\n\n[paragraph continues] Sruva at its bottom with the right hand, with the words,\n\'The hand of Vish _n_ u art thou\'\xc2\x97\n\n4 4. He offers with the Sruva the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya oblations.\n\n5 5. Beginning from the north-west side of the fire he offers (the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya)\nunintermittingly on the south side (of the fire) with (the verse), \'Thou Agni\nart full of foresight\' (Rig-veda I, 31, 10).\n\n6\\. Beginning from the south-west side of the fire he unintermittingly offers\non the north side with (the verse), \'To whom these snowy mountains\' (Rig-veda\nX, 121, 4).\n\n7\\. To Agni belongs the northern \xc3\x82 _g_ ya portion, to Soma the southern.\n\n8 8. In the middle (are made) the other oblations,\n\n9\\. (With the words,) \'Agni is the begetter; may he give to me N.N. as my\nwife; svaha!\n\n\'Soma is rich in wives; may he make me rich in wives by N.N.; svaha!\n\n\'Pushan is rich in kindred; may he make me rich in kindred by the father, the\nmother, the brothers of N.N.; svaha!\'\n\n10 10. At the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya oblations the offering of the two \xc3\x82 _g_ ya portions and\nof the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t oblation is not standing,\n\np. 28\n\n11 11. Nor in the standing oblations, according to Ma _n_ _d_ ukeya.\n\n12 12. The place for the insertion is the interval between the Mahavyah _ri_\ntis, the general expiation, and the oblation to Pra _g_ apati.\n\np. 29\n\n13\\. If the oblation consists in \xc3\x82 _g_ ya, let him seize the Ku _s_ a blades\nin his left hand with his right hand at their points and with the left at\ntheir roots, and let him wet their points (with \xc3\x82 _g_ ya) in the Sruva, the\nmiddle and the roots in the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya pot;\n\n14\\. In the oblations of cooked food, however, the points in the Sru _k_ , the\nmiddle in the Sruva, the roots in the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya pot.\n\n15\\. When he then has thrown them (into the fire) with the words, \'Agni\'s\ngarment art thou,\'\n\n16\\. And has put on (the fire) three pieces of wood,\n\n17 17. (Water) is sprinkled round (the fire) as stated above.\n\n18\\. Oblations for which only the deities are indicated, but no texts\nprescribed, are to be made merely with the word SV\xc3\x82H\xc3\x82, \'To such and such a\ndeity svaha! To such and such a deity svaha!\'\n\n19 19. The ritual (here) declared of the sacrifice (to\n\np. 30\n\nbe performed) when (the father\'s) assent (to give away his daughter) has been\ndeclared\xc2\x97\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[26:1](sbe29011.htm#fr_54) 9, 1. \'When no special rule is stated, the Sruva is\nto be understood as the vessel (for the offering). Thereby the rule, "The _G_\nuhu is the vessel" ( _S_ rauta-sutra III, 19, 5) is abolished (for the G _ri_\nhya rites).\' Naraya _n_ a.\n\n[26:3](sbe29011.htm#fr_55) The manner of holding the Sruva in which the \xc3\x82 _g_\nya is, is described by Katyayana, _S_ raut. I, 10, 6 seq., Stenzler\'s note on\nParaskara I, 1, 4.\n\n[27:4](sbe29011.htm#fr_56) As to the characteristics of \xc3\x82 _g_ ya (sacrificial\nbutter), which is the substance offered at most of the G _ri_ hya sacrifices,\ncomp the statements of the G _ri_ hya-sa _m_ graha-pari _s_ ish _t_ a I, 105\nseq.\n\n[27:5](sbe29011.htm#fr_57) Avi _k_ _kh_ inna _m_ (unintermittingly) is\nexplained in Nar.\'s commentary by ekadharaya.\n\n[27:8](sbe29011.htm#fr_58) 8 seq. Here are indicated the chief oblations of\nthis sacrifice (anya ahutaya _h_ pradhanabhuta _h_ , Nar.), or the avapa (the\ninsertion, Sutra 12) which comes between the standing introductory and\nconcluding oblations.\n\n[27:10](sbe29011.htm#fr_59) On Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t, comp. Weber, Indische\nStudien, IX, 217.\n\n[28:11](sbe29011.htm#fr_60) See chap. 8, 13.\n\n[28:12](sbe29011.htm#fr_61) This Sutra prescribes where the avapa, i.e. the\nspecial characteristical offerings of each sacrifice, is to be inserted\nbetween the regular offerings that belong to the standing model. The same\nsubject is treated of in the _S_ rauta-sutra in the two rules, I, 16, 3 and 4:\n\'Whatsoever is offered between the two \xc3\x82 _g_ ya portions and the Svish _t_ ak\n_ri_ t, that is called avapa; this is the chief part (pradhana) (of the\nsacrifice); the other (oblations) are subordinate thereto (tada\xe1\xb9\x85gani).\' The\nposition of the avapa among the other oblations is indicated by Paraskara in\nthe following rule (I, 5, 6): Between the general expiation and the oblation\nto Pra _g_ apati, this is the place for the avapa.\' (The word vivahe at the\nend of this Sutra seems to me to belong not to this rule, but to Sutra 7.) Our\nSutra is identical with that of Paraskara word for word; only instead of\nsarvapraya _s_ _k_ itta, as Paraskara has, we read here, mahavyah _ri_\ntisarvapraya _s_ _k_ itta. This means, I believe, that the avapa, preceded and\nfollowed by the Mahavyah _ri_ ti oblations (comp. below, I, 12, 13), should be\nplaced between the Sarvapraya _s_ _k_ itta and the Pra _g_ apatya oblation.\nThe oblations made with the Mahavyah _ri_ tayas are four in number; the\ncorresponding formulas are: bhu _h_ svaha, bhuva _h_ svaha, sva _h_ svaha,\nbhur bhuva _h_ sva _h_ svaha (comp. below, chap. 12, 12). The Sarvapraya _s_\n_k_ itta (general expiation) consists of two oblations, one with the three\nMahavyah _ri_ tayas, the other with the verse aya _s_ _k_ agne, quoted in the\n_S_ rauta-sutra III, 19, 3, and in \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana\'s _S_ rauta-sutra I, 11, 13.\n(On the Sarvapraya _s_ _k_ itta in the _S_ rauta ritual, compare Hillebrandt,\nNeu- und Vollmondsopfer, p. 166.) The Pra _g_ apatya oblation is performed\nwith the formula Pra _g_ apataye svaha. The discussions of Naraya _n_ a on\nthis Sutra (see p. 125 of the German edition) evidently fail to bring out the\ntrue meaning of the text; according to this commentator the oblations follow\neach other in this order: the two \xc3\x82 _g_ yabhagas, the principal oblations\n(pradhanahutaya _h_ ), the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t, the four Mahavyah _ri_ ti\noblations, the two Sarvapraya _s_ _k_ itta oblations, the Pra _g_ apatya\noblation. Finally we may mention the corrupt form in which the corresponding\npassage of the _S_ ambavya-sutra is preserved p. 29 in the MS. There the two\nSutras 10 and 11 are placed before the Mantra in Sutra 9. This Mantra then is\ngiven down to svaheti, then follows a _g_ yena, which seems to me to form part\nof the same Sutra, and to refer to the oblations to which the Mantra belongs.\nThen the MS. goes on: mahavyah _ri_ tishu sarvapraya _s_ _k_ ittara _m_ (sic)\netad avapasthana _m_ a _g_ yahavishi vyah _ri_ tishu sarvapraya _s_ _k_ ittara\n_m_ (the syllables praya _s_ _k_ ittara _m_ seem to be expunged) svish _t_ ak\n_ri_ to sthalipake. In the commentary I find the following _S_ lokas, which I\ngive exactly as they are read in the MS.: tis _ri_ _n_ a _m_ vyah _ri_ tina\n_m_ _k_ a praya _s_ _k_ ittahutir api yad antara _m_ tad apapasthana _m_ sarpi\n_h_ pradhanake. sthalipake vyah _ri_ tina _m_ yat tat svish _t_ ak _ri_\ntottara _m_ ahutina _m_ pradhanana _m_ nanadaivata _kh_ andasa _m_ yas tu\nkalas tad avapasthanam ita _k_ yate budhai _h_ tatas tat ta _m_ ma arabhya\npraya _s_ _k_ ittahuti _h_ kramat.\n\n[29:17](sbe29011.htm#fr_62) See above, chap. 8, 17.\n\n[29:19](sbe29011.htm#fr_63) This Sutra, though reckoned in the Indian\ntradition to p. 30 chap. 9, seems to me clearly to belong to the next chapter,\nand to contain the subject, to which the predicate is given in 10, 1. For\nprati _s_ rute, see chap. 7, 1.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 10](sbe29012.htm)\n\n'
