Nund Lal then enquired from Akroor, "Uncle!\nwhy do you stay so long in the water, when it is so cold? I was very anxious\nabout you, supposing that you had forgotten to proceed on your journey! Have\nyou seen any thing strange? Explain to me, that the doubts of my mind may be\nremoved?"\n\nOn hearing these words, Akroor said, joining his hands, "Lord of Bruj! you\nknow every thing? You have shewn yourself admirably to me in the water.\nNothing is too wonderful for Krishnu to perform. I have confidence in thee,\nlet us proceed, lord! on the road to Muthoora? Let us not delay here, but go\non quickly, and perform what we have to do." At these words Huri went into the\nruth, accompanied by Akroor, and stood up. Nund and all the cowherds had\nproceeded on their journey, and on arrival had pitched their tents outside the\ncity of Muttra; and in anxious expectation of the arrival of Bulram and\nKrishnu, said to one another, "What has been the reason of the delay they have\n\np. 43\n\nmade in bathing, and why has Huri not yet arrived?" when Shree Krishnu Chund,\nthe root of joy, arrived and met them.\n\nThen Akroor Jee, with joined hands, and bowing his head, said in a\nsupplicating manner, "O lord of Bruj! come and make my house pure, and gratify\nyour worshippers with a sight of you?" Huri said in reply to Akroor, "First\nacquit yourself of your debt to Kuns, then show me your house. Present our\nhumble compliments." Akroor bowed his head at these words, and departed.\n\nHaving descended from his ruth, he arrived after some time at the place where\nKuns was holding a court. On seeing him, Kuns descended from his throne, and\ngave him a most friendly reception; and taking hold of his hand with great\nrespect, seated him on a throne near himself, and asked him to communicate all\nthe news, and the occurrences of his late visit.\n\nAkroor replied, "The greatness of Bruj cannot be explained. How shall I speak\nin fitting terms of the greatness of Nund. I have accomplished what you\ninstructed me to do. Bulram and Krishnu have both come here; and all the\ninhabitants of Bruj have brought presents. They are encamped on the banks of\nthe river; great numbers of them have come with numerous carts."\n\nKuns was delighted at these words, and said, "Akroor Jee! you have executed a\nmost important business for me to-day, in having brought Bulram and Krishnu;\ngo now to your home, and repose."\n\nHaving narrated thus much, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja Pureechit,--O\ngreat king! on receiving permission from Kuns, Akroor Jee went home; and was\noccupied with many thoughts and reflections. And Huldhur and Gobind, having\ngone to where Nund and Oopnund were sitting, and asked their permission to\nlook at the city, Nund Rae Jee produced some sweetmeats, which the two\nbrothers ate; and afterwards he gave them permission to go, and not to delay\nlong.\n\np. 144\n\nWhen Nund, the chief, had thus spoken, the two brothers being greatly\nrejoiced, took their companions, the cowherds\' children, with them, and went\nforth to see the city. As they proceeded, they saw woods and orchards on all\nsides of the city, in full blossom and fruit: and birds were pouring forth in\nthem all kinds of agreeable melodies. There were large tanks, filled with pure\nwater. In them, lotuses were in full flower, on which swarms of bees were\nhumming. And on the bank, geese and herons, and other birds were sporting. A\ncool, fragrant breeze was blowing. And on the margins of the enclosed grounds,\ngardens of betel were planted. In the midst, for many koss, beds of flowers\nwere blooming. At different places, wheels and leather buckets were in full\nplay at the wells; and the gardeners, singing sweet songs, were sprinkling\nwater.\n\nBeing pleased at beholding this beautiful appearance of the woods and groves,\nKrishnu entered the city of Muthoora with his companions. There were castles\nof copper on all sides of the city, and there was a deep, broad ditch, with\nwater springing at the bottom. There were four crystal gates, whose doors were\ncomposed of eight metals, and inlaid with gold. And in the city, there were\nfive-storied and seven-storied houses of all colours, red, yellow, green and\nwhite, which vied with the clouds in height. The brilliancy of the ornaments\non their domes shone like lightning: flags and banners were waving: the sweet\nscent of the perfume, burnt at the time of worshipping, came forth from the\ntrellis-work, lattices and air-holes. At the doors there were pillars formed\nof plantain trees; and golden waterpots filled with sprouts. There were\ngarlands and nosegays, and strings of flowers suspended in every direction.\nThere was music in every house. And on one side, the jewelled and golden\npalace of the Raja stood apart in its splendour, of which the beauty admits\nnot of description. Such was the beautiful and elegant city of Muthoora, which\nShree Krishnu and Buldeo, accompanied by the cowherds\' children, went to see.\n\np. 145\n\nThere was great bustle in Muthoora on the arrival of Nund\'s son; all the\npeople, on hearing it, rushed forth from their houses, leaving their domestic\nbusiness. And the women of Muthoora, on hearing the news, were very much\nagitated. They exclaimed to each other, "Bulbhudru and Moorari are come, let\nus go friend! and see those whom Akroor went to bring." Some ran off in the\nmiddle of their dinner: others, while bathing; and others, while engaged in\nplaiting their hair. They forgot all amorous sport and dalliance with their\nhusbands; and put on their dresses and ornaments in a most confused, irregular\nmanner. They got up, and went off in the state they were then in, and came to\nlook upon Krishnu. Laying aside shame, modesty and fear, some stood at the\nwindows, some in the balconies, some at the doors, and some wandered about the\nlanes. Wherever the women stood, they pointed to Krishnu, stretching out their\nhands. The fair Bulram was dressed in blue, and Krishnu in a yellow silk vest.\nThese are the two nephews of Kuns, from whom no evil spirit escapes. Let us\nbehold with our own eyes the forms of those, of whom our ancestors have only\nheard. One of us in a former birth must have performed a most meritorious act,\nas a reward for which Bruhmu has granted us an opportunity of seeing them."\n\nShree Shookdeo, the sage, continued,--O great king! in this manner, the\ninhabitants of the city, both men and women, conversed with each other, making\nall kinds of remarks, and were rejoiced at beholding Krishnu and Bulram. In\nwhatever market, road or cross-road, they and their companions made their\nappearance, the inhabitants stood upon their houses, and through joy sprinkled\nthem with, and poured down upon them, perfumes and sandal, and flowers. And\nwhilst admiring the beauty of the city, they said to the cowherds\' children,\n"Brothers! do not any of you mistake the road; and if any should mistake it,\nlet him go to our last encampment." When they had gone some distance, they saw\nthe dhobees of Kuns\n\np. 146\n\nwith loads of washed clothes and bundles. They were drunk and besmeared with\ncoloured earths, and singing the praises of Kuns, as they were coming out of\nthe city. On seeing them, Shree Krishnu Chund said to Buldeo Jee, "Take away\nall their clothes, and wear some yourself, and give some to the cowherds\'\nchildren to wear, and allow them to steal whatever is surplus." When he had\nspoken thus to his brother, they all went up in a body to the dhobees, and\nHuri said to them, "Give us the fine white clothes, and receive them back\nagain, when we have paid our visit to the Raja. We will give you some dresses\nfrom amongst those, which the Raja presents us with."\n\nAt these words, the head dhobee amongst them, laughed, and said, "We will\narrange and place the clothes at the Raja\'s gate; come there, and take them,\nand give us what you please. You wander about the jungle, tending cows; you\nare of the cowherd caste, and wear blankets. You have come here disguised as\njugglers: do you flatter yourselves, that you are to wear the Raja\'s garments?\nBy going all together to the Raja, with the hope of obtaining his dresses, you\nrun an almost sure risk of losing your lives."\n\nAt this speech of the dhobee\'s, Huri smiled, and again said, "We ask you for\nthe clothes in a proper manner; why do you misunderstand us? It will be no\nloss to you, giving us the clothes: but you will gain a good name by doing\nso."\n\nThe dhobee was enraged at these words, and said, "Just look at the fellow, who\nwants to wear the Raja\'s clothes: be off with you; or I will put you to death\ninstantly." Krishnu was angry at these words, and gave him a blow with the\nside of his hand, so that his head flew off like a stalk of Indian corn. Then\nall his companions and assistants, fearing to meet the same fate, left their\nbundles and loads behind them, and ran off to Kuns, and bawled out, "Shree\nKrishnu Jee has taken all our clothes: some he wears himself, and has given\nsome to his brother to wear, and distributed some to the cowherds\'\n\np. 147\n\nchildren, and allowed them to steal the remainder." In the meantime, the\ncowherds\' children were much pleased, and began to put the clothes on wrong.\nHaving tightened their waists, they put the upper garments on their feet, and\ntheir arms in drawers. They did not understand the proper way of putting on\nthe different articles. Krishnu laughed on seeing what took place.\n\nWhen they proceeded thence, a tailor came, and making a salutation said,\nstanding before them with joined hands, addressing Krishnu, "O great king! I\nam called the servant of Kuns, but in my mind I am constantly celebrating your\nmany virtues; if you will be so kind as to give me the order, I will put on\nthe clothes for them, and from doing so, shall be called your servant."\n\nWhen he had thus spoken, Shree Krishnu Chund, acquainted with the secrets of\nthe heart, knowing him to be one of his worshippers, called him near, and\nsaid, "You have come at a lucky moment; (or it is lucky you have come,) fit\nthe clothes well on them."\n\nUpon this he began at once to unseam and unravel, and cut and patch; and sewed\nthe clothes up again so as to fit exactly; then having selected dresses for\nKrishnu and Bulram and all the rest, he assisted in dressing them. After this,\nNund Lal, having granted him absolution from sin, took him with him and went\non.\n\nSoodama, gardener, came there and brought them to his house. He placed\ngarlands upon all of them; there were songs of congratulation and rejoicing in\nthe gardener\'s house.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XLIII](psa44.htm)\n\n'
