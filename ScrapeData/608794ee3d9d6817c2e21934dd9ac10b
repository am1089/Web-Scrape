Vyasa said :-- O King Janamejaya! Next to this Pu _s_ paraga ma _n_ i\nenclosure wall comes the tenth enclosure wall, made of Padmaraga ma _n_ i, red\nlike the red Kunkuma and the Rising Sun. It is ten yojanas high. All its\nground, entrance gates and temples and arbours are all made of Padmaraga ma\n_n_ i. Within this reside the sixty four Kalas or Sub-S\xc2\x92aktis adorned with\nvarious ornaments and holding weapons in their hands. Each of them has a\nseparate Loka (region) allotted and within this Loka he has get his own\nformidable weapons, Vahanas, families and their\n\n\n\np. 1180\n\n\n\nleaders or Governors. O King! Now hear the names of the sixty four Kalas. They\nare :-- Pingalak _s_ i, Vis\xc2\x92alak _s_ i, Samriddhi, Vriddhi, S\xc2\x92raddha, Svaha,\nSvadha, Maya, Sa\xc3\xb1g\xc3\xb1a, Vasundhara, Trilokadhatri, Savitri, Gayatri,\nTridas\xc2\x92es\xc2\x92vsri, Surupa, Bahurupa, Skandamata, Achyutapriya, Vimala, Amala, Aru\n_n_ i, \xc3\x82runi, Prakriti, Vikriti, S\xc2\x92ri _st_ i, Sthiti, Sa _m_ rhiti, Sandhya,\nMata, Sati, Hamsi, Mardika, Vajrika, Para, Devamata, Bhagavati, Devaki,\nKamalasana, Trimukhi, Saptamukhi, Surasura vimardini, Lambo _st_ hi,\n\xc3\x9brdhakes\xc2\x92i, Bahusir _s_ a, Vrikodari Ratharekhahvaya, S\xc2\x92as\xc2\x92ireka, Gaganavega,\nPavanavega, Bhuvanapala, Madanatura, Ananga, Anangamathana, Anangamekhala,\nAnangakusuma, Visvarupa, Suradika, K _s_ aya _m_ kari, Ak _s_ yobhya,\nSatyavadini, Bahurupa, S\xc2\x92uchivrata, Udara and Vagi _s_ \xc2\x92i. These are the sixty\nfour Kalas. All of them have got luminous faces and long lolling tongues. Fire\nis always coming out from the faces of all of them. The eyes of all of them\nare red with anger. They are uttering :-- We will drink all the water and thus\ndry up the oceans; we will annihilate fire, we will stop the flow of air and\ncontrol it. Today we will devour the whole universe and so forth. All of them\nhave got bows and arrows in their hands; all are eager to fight. The four\nquarters are being reverberated with the clashing of their teeth. The hairs on\ntheir heads are all tawny and they stand upwards. Each of them has one hundred\nAk _s_ auhi _n_ i forces under them. O King! What more to say than this that\neach of them has got power to destroy one lakh Brahma _nd_ as; and their one\nhundred Ak _s_ auhi _n_ i forces also can do the same. There is nothing that\nis not impracticable with them. What they cannot do cannot be conceived by\nmind nor can be uttered in speech. All the war materials exist within their\nenclosures. Chariots, horses, elephants, weapons, and forces all are\nunlimited. All the war materials are ready at all times and in abundance. Next\ncomes the eleventh enclosure wall built of Gomedama _n_ i. It is ten Yojanas\nhigh. Its colour is like the newly blown Java flower. All the ground, trees,\ntanks, houses, pillars, birds and all other things are all red and built of\nGomedama _n_ i. Here dwell the thirty-two Maha S\xc2\x92aktis adorned with various\nornament made of Gomedama _n_ i and furnished with various weapons. They are\nalways eager to fight. Their eyes are always red with anger; their bees are\nlike Pis\xc2\x92achas and their hands are like chakras (discs). \xc2\x93Pierce him,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93Beat\nhim,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93Cut him,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93Tear him asunder,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93Burn him down,\xc2\x94 are the words constantly\nuttered by them. The inhabitants of the place always worship them. Each of\nthem has ten Ak _s_ auhi _n_ i forces. These are inordinately powerful. It is\nimpossible to describe that. It seems that each S\xc2\x92akti can easily destroy one\nlakh Brahma _nd_ as.\n\n\n\np. 1181\n\n\n\nInnumerable chariots, elephants, hordes, etc., and other vahanas are here.\nVerily all the war materials of the Devi Bhagavati are seen in this Gomedama\n_n_ i enclosure.\n\n\n\n31-51. Now I am mentioning the auspicious, sin destroying names of these\nS\xc2\x92aktis :-- Vidya, Hri, Pu _st_ i, Praj\xc3\xb1a, Sini vali, Kuhu, Rudra, Virya,\nPrabha, Nanda, Po _s_ a _n_ i, Riddhida, S\xc2\x92ubha, Kalaratri, Maharatri, Bhadra\nKaIi, Kaparddini, Vikriti, Da _nd_ i, Mu _nd_ ini, Sendukha _nd_ a, S\xc2\x92ikha\n_nd_ ini, Nis\xc2\x92umbha s\xc2\x92umbha mathani, Mahi _s_ asura marddini, Indra _n_ i,\nRudra _n_ i, S\xc2\x92ankarardha sariri _n_ i, Nari, Niraya _n_ i Tris\xc2\x92ulini, Palini,\nAmbika, and Hladini. (See the Dak _s_ i _n_ a Murti Samhita and other\nTantras.)\n\n\n\nNever there is any chance that they will be defeated anywhere. Hence if all\nthose S\xc2\x92aktis get angry at any time, this Brahma _nd_ a ceases to exist. Next\nto this Gomeda enclosure comes the enclosure made of diamonds. It is ten\nyojanas high; on all sides there are the entrance gates; the doors are hinged\nthere with nice mechanisms. Nice new diamond trees exist here. All the roads,\nroyal roads, trees, and the spaces for watering their roots, tanks, wells,\nreservoirs, Saranga and other musical instruments are all made of diamonds.\nHere dwells S\xc2\x92ri Bhuvanes\xc2\x92vari Devi with Her attendants. O King! Each of them\nhas a lakh attendants. All of them are proud of their beauty. Some of them are\nholding fans in their hands; some are holding cups for drinking water; some,\nbetelnuts; some are holding umbrellas; some chowries; some are holding various\nclothings; some flowers; some, looking glasses; some, saffrons; some\ncollyrium, whereas some others are holding Sindura (red lead). Some are ready\nto do the painting works; some are anxious to champoo the feet; some are eager\nto make Her wear ornaments; some are anxious to put garlands of flowers on Her\nneck. All of them are skilled in various arts of enjoyments and they are all\nyoung. To gain the Grace of the Devi, they consider the whole universe as\ntrifling. Now I shall mention to you the names of the attendants of the Devi,\nproud of their possessing lots of amorous gestures and postures. Listen. They\nare :-- Anangarupa, Anangamadana, Madanatura, Bhuvanavega, Bhuvanapalika,\nSarvas\xc2\x92is\xc2\x92ira, Anangavedana, Anangamekhala, these are the Eight Sakhis. Each\nof them is as fair as Vidyullata. Each is adorned with various ornaments and\nskilled in all actions. When they walk to and fro with canes and rods in their\nhands in the service of the Devi, they look as if the lightning flashes\nglimmer on all sides.\n\n\n\n52-71 On the outer portion of the enclosure wall, on the eight sides are\nsituated the dwelling houses of these eight Sakhis and they are always full of\nvarious vahanas and weapons. Next to this enclosure of diamond\n\n\n\np. 1182\n\n\n\ncomes the thirteenth enclosure wall made of Vaidurya ma _n_ i. Its height is\nten yojanas. There are entrance gates and doorways on the four sides. The\ncourt inside, the houses, the big roads, wells, tanks, ponds, rivers and even\nthe sands are all made of Vaidurya ma _n_ i. On the eight sides reside the\neight Matrikas Brahmi, etc., with their hosts. These Matrikas represent the\nsum-total of the individual Matrikas in every Brahma _nd_ a. Now hear their\nnames :-- (1) Brahmi, (2) Mahes\xc2\x92vari, (3) Kaumari, (4) Vai _sn_ avi, (5)\nVarahi, (6) Indra _n_ i, (7) Chamu _nd_ a, and (8) Maha Lak _s_ mi. Their\nforms are like those of Brahma and Rudra and others. They are always engaged\nin doing good to the Universe and reside here with their own Vahanas and\nweapons.\n\n\n\nAt the four gates, the various Vahanas of Bhagavati remain always fully\nequipped. Somewhere there are Ko _t_ is and Ko _t_ is of elephants. At some\nplaces there are Ko _t_ is and Ko _t_ is of horses; at others there are camps,\nhouses, at others there are swans, lions; at others there are Garu _d_ as; at\nother places there are peacocks, bulls and various other beings all fully\nequipped and arranged in due order. Similarly the above mentioned animals are\nyoked to Ko _t_ is and Ko _t_ is of chariots; there are coachmen (syces); at\nsome places flags are fluttering high on them so as to reach the heavens and\nthus they are adding beauty. At other places the aerial cars are arranged in\nrows, countless, with various sounding instruments in them, with flags soaring\nhigh in the Heavens and endowed with various ensigns and emblems. O King! Next\nto this Vaidurya enclosure, comes the fourteenth enclosure wall built of\nIndranilama _n_ i; its height is ten Yojanas. The court inside, houses, roads,\nwells, tanks and reservoirs, etc., all are built of Indranilama _n_ i. There\nis here a lotus consisting of sixteen petals extending to many Yojanas in\nwidth and shining like a second Sudars\xc2\x92ana Chakra. On these sixteen petals\nreside the sixteen S\xc2\x92aktis of Bhagavati, with their hosts. Now I am mentioning\nthe names of these. Hear :-- Karali, Vikarali, Uma, Sarasvati, S\xc2\x92ri, Durga, \xc3\x9b\n_s_ a, Lak _s_ mi, S\xc2\x92ruti, Smriti, Dhriti, S\xc2\x92raddha, Medha, Mati, Kanti, and\n\xc3\x82rya. These are the 16 S\xc2\x92aktis. They all are dark blue, of the colour of the\nfresh rain-cloud; they wield in their hands axes and shields. It seems they\nare ever eager to fight. O King! These S\xc2\x92aktis are the Rulers of all the\nseparate S\xc2\x92aktis of the other Brahma _nd_ as. These are the forces of S\xc2\x92ri\nDevi.\n\n\n\n72-90. Being strengthened by the Devi\xc2\x92s strength, these are always surrounded\nby various chariots and forces, various other S\xc2\x92aktis follow them. If they\nlike, they can cause great agitation in the whole universe. Had I thousand\nfaces, I would not have been able to describe what an\n\n\n\np. 1183\n\n\n\namount of strength they wield. Now I describe the fifteenth enclosure wall.\nListen. Next to this Indranilama _n_ i enclosure, comes the enclosure made of\npearls (mukta), very wide and ten Yojanas high. The court inside, its space,\ntrees, all are built of pearls. Within this enclosure there is a lotus with\neight petals, all of pearls. On these petals reside the eight S\xc2\x92aktis, the\nadvisers and ministers of the Devi. Their appearances, weapons, dresses,\nenjoyments, everything is like those of S\xc2\x92ri Devi. Their duty is to inform the\nDevi of what is going on in the Brahma _nd_ as. They are skilled in all\nsciences and arts and clever in all actions. They are very clever, skillful\nand clever in knowing beforehand the desires and intentions of S\xc2\x92ri Devi and\nthey perform those things accordingly. Each one of them has many other S\xc2\x92aktis\nwho also live here. By their J\xc3\xb1ana S\xc2\x92akti they know all the news concerning\nthe Jivas in every Brahma _nd_ a. Now I mention the names of those eight\nSakhis. Listen. Anangakusuma, Anangakusuma-tura, Anangamadana, Ananga\nmadanatura, Bhuva _n_ apala, Gaganavega, S\xc2\x92as\xc2\x92irekha, and Gaganarekha. These\nare the eight Sakhis. They look red like the Rising Sun; and in their four\nhands they hold noose, goad, and signs of granting boons and \xc2\x93no fear.\xc2\x94 At\nevery instant they inform S\xc2\x92ri Devi of all the events of the Brahma _nd_ a.\nNext to this comes the sixteenth enclosure wall made of emerald (marakata); it\nis ten Yojanas high; the court inside, its space, and houses and everything\nare built of emeralds (marakata ma _n_ i). Here exist all the good objects of\nenjoyments. This is hexagonal, of the Yantra shape. And at every corner reside\nthe Devas. On the eastern corner resides the four-faced Brahma; he lives with\nGayatri Devi; he holds Kama _nd_ alu, rosary, signs indicating \xc2\x93no fear\xc2\x94 and\nDa _nd_ a (rod). The Devi Gayatri is also decorated with these. Here all the\nVedas, Smritis, the Pura _n_ as, and various weapons exist incarnate in their\nrespective forms. All the Avataras of Brahma, Gayatri, and Vyahritis that\nexist in this Brahma _nd_ a, all live here. On the south-west corner Maha Vi\n_sn_ u lives with Savitri; He holds conch shell, disc, club, and lotus.\nSavitri has got also all these. The Avataras of Vi _sn_ u that exist in every\nBrahma _nd_ a Matsya, Kurma, etc., and all the Avataras of Savitri that exist\nin every universe, all dwell in this place. On the north western corner exists\nMaha Rudra with Sarasvati. Both of them hold in their hands Paras\xc2\x92u, rosary,\nsigns granting boons and \xc2\x93no fear.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n91-110. All the Avataras of Rudra and Parvati (Gauri, etc.) facing south that\nexist in all the Brahma _nd_ as, dwell here. All the chief \xc3\x82gamas, sixty four\nin number and all the other Tantras reside here, incarnate in their due forms.\nOn the south-eastern corner, the Lord of wealth, Kuvera, of Bhagavati,\nsurrounded by roads\n\n\n\np. 1184\n\n\n\nand shops resides here with Maha Lak _s_ mi and his hosts holding the jar of\njewels (Ma _n_ i Kara _nd_ ika). On the western corner exists always Madana\nwith Rati, holding noose, goad, bow and arrow. All his amorous attendants\nreside here, incarnate in their forms. On the north-eastern corner resides\nalways the great hero Ga _n_ es\xc2\x92a, the Remover of obstacles, holding noose and\ngoad and with his Pu _st_ i Devi. O King! All the Vibhutis (manifestations) of\nGa _n_ es\xc2\x92a that exist in all the universes reside here. What more to say than\nthis, that Brahma and the other Devas and Devis here represent the sum-total\nof all the Brahmas and the Devas and the Devis that exist in all the Brahma\n_nd_ as. These all worship S\xc2\x92ri Bhagavati, remaining in their own spheres\nrespectively. O King! Next come the seventeenth enclosure wall made of\nPrabala. It is red like saffron and it is one hundred Yojanas high. As before,\nthe court inside, the ground and the houses all are made of Prabala. The\ngoddesses of the five elements, Hrillekha, Gagana, Rakta, Karalika, and\nMahochchhu _s_ ma reside here. The colours and lustres of the bodies of the\ngoddessses resemble those of the elements over which they preside\nrespectively. All of them are proud of their youth and hold in their four\nhands noose, goad and signs granting boons and \xc2\x93no fear.\xc2\x94 They are dressed\nlike S\xc2\x92ri Devi and reside here always. Next to this comes the eighteenth\nenclosure wall built of Navaratna (the nine jewels). It is many yojanas wide.\nThis enclosure wall is superior to all others and it is higher also. On the\nfour sides there exist innumerable houses, tanks, reservoirs, all built of\nNavaratna; these belong to the Devis, the presiding Deities of \xc3\x82mnayas (that\nwhich is to be studied or learnt by heart; the Vedas). The ten Maha Vidyas,\nKali, Tara, etc., of S\xc2\x92ri Devi and the Mahabhedas, that is, their all the\nAvataras all dwell here with their respective \xc3\x82vara _n_ as, Vahanas and\nornaments. All the Avataras of S\xc2\x92ri Devi for the killing of the Daityas and\nfor showing favour to the devotees live here. They are Pas\xc2\x92a _m_ kus\xc2\x92es\xc2\x92vari,\nBhuvanes\xc2\x92vari, Bhairavi, Kapala Bhuvanes\xc2\x92vari, A _m_ kus\xc2\x92a Bhuvanes\xc2\x92vari,\nPramada bhuvanes\xc2\x92vari, S\xc2\x92ri Krodha Bhuvanes\xc2\x92vari, Tripu _t_ as\xc2\x92varudha,\nNityaklinna, Annapurna, Tvarita, and the other avataras of Bhuvanes\xc2\x92vari, and\nKali, Tara and the other Mahavidyas are known as Mahavidyas. They live here\nwith their \xc3\x82vara _n_ a Devatas, Vahanas, and ornaments respectively. (Note :--\nThe \xc3\x82vara _n_ a Deities are the attendant Deities.) Here live also the seven\nKo _t_ is of Devis presiding over the Maha Mantras, all brilliant and fair\nlike the Ko _t_ i Suns. O King! Next to this enclosure wall comes the chief\nand crowning palace of S\xc2\x92ri Devi, built of\n\n\n\np. 1185\n\n\n\nChintama _n_ i gems. All the articles within this are built of Chintama _n_ i\ngems. Within this palace are seen hundreds and thousands of pillars. Some of\nthese pillars are built of Suryakantama _n_ i, some are built of Chandrakanta\nma _n_ i, and some are built of Vidyutkanta ma _n_ i. O King! The lustre and\nbrilliance of these pillars is so strong that no articles within this palace\nare visible to the eye. (Note :-- The face of the Goddess Kali is so bright\nthat it appears like a shadow, i.e., black.)\n\n\n\nHere ends the Eleventh Chapter on the description of the enclosure walls built\nof Padmaraga ma _n_ i, etc., of the Ma _n_ i Dvipa in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri\nMad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 12](bk12ch12.htm)\n\n'
