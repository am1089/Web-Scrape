He bargains for the king (Soma); and because he bargains for the\nking, therefore any and everything is vendible here. He says, 'Soma-seller, is\nthy king Soma for sale?'--'He is for sale,' says the Soma-seller.--'I will buy\nhim of thee!'--'Buy him!' says the Soma-seller.--'I will buy him of thee for\none-sixteenth (of the cow).'--'King Soma, surely, is worth more than that!'\nsays the Soma-seller.--'Yea, King Soma is worth more than that; but great,\nsurely, is the greatness of the cow,' says the Adhvaryu.\n\n3:3:3:22\\. 'From the cow (comes) fresh milk, from her boiled milk, from her\ncream, from her sour curds, from her sour cream, from her curdled milk, from\nher butter, from her ghee, from her clotted curds, from her whey:\n\n3:3:3:33\\. 'I will buy him of thee for one hoof 1!'--'King Soma, surely, is\nworth more than that!' says the Soma-seller.--'Yea, King Soma is worth more\nthan that, but great, surely, is the greatness of the cow,' replies the\nAdhvaryu; and, having (each time) enumerated the same ten virtues, he says, 'I\nwill buy him of thee for one foot,'--'for half (the cow),'--'for the\ncow!'--'King Soma has been bought!' says the Soma-seller, 'name the kinds!'\n\n3:3:3:44\\. He (the Adhvaryu) says, 'Gold is thine, a cloth is thine, a goat is\nthine, a milch cow is thine, a pair of kine is thine, three other (cows) are\nthine!' And because they first bargain and afterwards come to terms, therefore\nabout any and everything that is for sale here, people first bargain and\nafterwards\n\np. 70\n\ncome to terms. And the reason why only the Adhvaryu enumerates the virtues of\nthe cow, and not the Soma-seller those of the Soma, is that Soma is already\nglorified, since Soma is a god. And the Adhvaryu thereby glorifies the cow,\nthinking, 'Seeing her virtues he shall buy her!' This is why only the Adhvaryu\nenumerates the virtues of the cow, and not the Soma-seller those of the Soma.\n\n3:3:3:55\\. And as to his bargaining five times:--the sacrifice being of equal\nmeasure with the year, and there being five seasons in the year, he thus\nobtains it (the sacrifice, Soma) in five (divisions), and therefore he\nbargains five times.\n\n3:3:3:66\\. He then makes (the sacrificer) say on the gold 1 (Va _g_. S. IV,\n26), 'Thee, the pure, I buy with the pure,' for he indeed buys the pure with\nthe pure, when (he buys) Soma with gold;--'the brilliant with the brilliant,'\nfor he indeed buys the brilliant with the brilliant, when (he buys) Soma with\ngold;--'the immortal with the immortal,' for he indeed buys the immortal with\nthe immortal, when (he buys) Soma with gold.\n\n3:3:3:77\\. He then tempts 2 the Soma-seller (with the gold): 'In compensation\n3 for thy cow,' whereby he means to say, 'With the sacrificer (be) thy cow!'\n\np. 71\n\n[paragraph continues] He then draws it (the gold) back towards the sacrificer,\nand throws it down, with, 'Ours be thy gold!' whereby he (the sacrificer)\ntakes unto himself the vital energy, and the Soma-seller gets only the body.\nThereupon the Soma-seller takes it 1.\n\n3:3:3:88\\. He then makes him (the sacrificer) say on the she-goat, which\nstands facing the west, 'Thou art the bodily form of fervour,'--that she-goat\nwas indeed produced as the bodily form of fervour, of Pra _g_ apati; hence he\nsays, 'Thou art the bodily form of fervour,'--'Pra _g_ apati's kind,' because\nshe brings forth three times in the year, therefore she is Pra _g_ apati's\nkind. 'Thou art bought with the most excellent animal,' because she brings\nforth three times in the year, she is the most excellent of animals. 'May I\nincrease with a thousandfold increase!' Thereby he implores a blessing: a\nthousand meaning abundance, he thereby means to say, 'May I obtain abundance!'\n\n3:3:3:99\\. With that (text) he gives the she-goat, with that he takes the king\n2; for a _g_ a (goat) doubtless\n\np. 72\n\nmeans the same as a _g_ a (driving thither 1), since it is through her (the\nshe-goat) that he finally drives him (Soma) thither. It is thus in a mystic\nsense that they call her 'a _g_ a.'\n\n3:3:3:1010\\. He takes the king, with the text (Va _g_. S. IV, 27), 'Come to\nus, a friend, bestowing good friends!' whereby he means to say, 'Come to us,\nas a kind and propitious one!' Having pushed back the garment on the\nsacrificer's right thigh, he lays him (Soma) down thereon, with the text,\n'Seat thee on Indra's right thigh,'--for he, the sacrificer, is at present\nIndra 2: therefore he says, 'Seat thee on Indra's right thigh;'--'willing on\nthe willing,' whereby he means to say, 'beloved on the beloved one;'--'tender\non the tender!' whereby he means to say, 'propitious on the propitious one.'\n\n3:3:3:1111\\. Thereupon he (the sacrificer) assigns (to the Gandharvas) the\nobjects constituting the purchase price for the Soma, with the text, 'O Svana,\nBhra _g_ a, A\xe1\xb9\x85ghari, Bambhari, Hasta, Suhasta, K _ri_ _s_ anu! these are your\nwages for Soma: keep them! may they not fail you!' Now those (Gandharvas) are\ninstead of the hearth-mounds--these being the names of the hearth-mounds--it\nis these very (names) that he thereby has assigned to them 3.\n\np. 73\n\n3:3:3:1212\\. He now uncovers (his head 1); for he who is consecrated becomes\nan embryo, and embryos are enveloped both in the amnion and the outer\nmembrane: him (the sacrificer or sacrifice) he has now brought forth, and\ntherefore he uncovers himself. Now it is he (Soma 2) that becomes an embryo,\nand therefore he is enveloped, since embryos are, as it were, enveloped both\nin the amnion and the outer membrane.\n\n3:3:3:1313\\. He then makes (the sacrificer) say the text (Va _g_. S. IV, 28),\n'Keep me, O Agni, from evil ways! let me share in the right ways.' Now he\n(Soma) approaches him while he is seated, and when he has come, he rises:\nthereby he does wrong and breaks the vow. This, then, is his expiation of that\n(transgression), and thus no wrong is thereby done, and he breaks not the vow:\ntherefore he says, 'Keep me, O Agni, from evil ways! let me share in the right\nways!'\n\n3:3:3:1414\\. Having then taken the king, he rises, with the text, 'With new\nlife, with good life, am I risen after the immortals;' for he who rises after\nthe bought Soma, rises indeed after the immortal: therefore he says,' With new\nlife, with good life, am I risen after the immortals.'\n\n3:3:3:1515\\. Thereupon he takes the king and goes towards the car, with the\ntext (Va _g_. S. IV, 29), 'We have\n\np. 74\n\nentered upon the path that leadeth to wellbeing, free from danger; whereon he\nescheweth all haters, and meeteth with good 1.'\n\n3:3:3:1616\\. Now, once on a time, the gods, while performing sacrifice, were\nafraid of an attack from the Asura-Rakshas. They perceived that prayer for a\nsafe journey; and having warded off the evil spirits by means of that prayer,\nthey attained wellbeing in the safe and foeless shelter of that prayer. And so\ndoes he now ward off the evil spirits by means of that prayer, and attain\nwellbeing in the safe and foeless shelter of that prayer. For this reason he\nsays, 'We have entered upon the path that leadeth to well-being, free from\ndanger; whereon he escheweth all haters and meeteth with good.'\n\n3:3:3:1717\\. They carry him thus 2, and (afterwards) drive him about on the\ncart; whereby they exalt him: for this reason they carry the seed on their\nhead (to the field), and bring in (the corn) on the cart.\n\n3:3:3:1818\\. Now the reason why he buys (the Soma) near water 3 is that--water\nmeaning sap--he thereby buys Soma sapful; and as to there being gold, he\nthereby buys him lustrous; and as to there being a cloth, he thereby buys him\nwith his skin; and as to there being a she-goat, he thereby buys him fervid;\nand as to there being a milch cow, he thereby buys him with the milk to be\nmixed with him; and as to there being a pair (of kine), he thereby buys him\nwith a mate.--He should buy him with ten (objects), and\n\np. 75\n\nnot with other than ten, for the vira _g_ consists of ten syllables, and Soma\nis of vira _g_ nature: therefore he should buy him with ten (objects) and not\nwith other than ten.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[69:1](sbe2613.htm#fr_186) That is, for one-eighth of a cow, each foot\nconsisting of two hoofs (or toes, _s_ apha).\n\n[70:1](sbe2613.htm#fr_187) That is, according to Katy. VII, 8, 5, in making\nhim touch the gold. The Ka _n_ va text has, 'Thereupon he buys him (Soma) with\ngold.'\n\n[70:2](sbe2613.htm#fr_188) Or, according to the commentaries, 'he frightens\nthe Soma-seller (by threatening to take back the money).'\n\n[70:3](sbe2613.htm#fr_189) ? Sagme (? compact), explained by the commentators\nas meaning the sacrificer. Perhaps it may mean, 'one of the parties to an\nagreement,' and hence here the sacrificer as the bargainee. The Ka _n_ va text\nreads, He then takes it back again (punar adatte) with 'Sagme to go _h_ ,' and\nthrows it down with 'Ours thy gold.'\n\n[71:1](sbe2613.htm#fr_190) According to some authorities, the gold is again\ntaken away forcibly from the Soma-seller by the Adhvaryu, after the sacrificer\nhas uncovered his head (paragraph a 2), and the seller is driven away by blows\nwith a speckled cane. Katy. VII, 8, 27. According to \xc3\x82pastamba (ib.), he buys\noff the Soma-cow with another cow, and then dismisses her to the cow-pen; and\nif the Soma-seller objects, he is to be beaten with a speckled cane. The\nManava-sutra merely says, that they are to give the Soma-seller something for\ncompensation. The whole transaction was evidently a feigned purchase,\nsymbolising the acquisition of the Soma by the gods from the Gandharvas. The\nreal bargain was probably concluded before the sacrificial performance. See\nalso Haug, Ait. Br. Transl. p. 59, note 2.\n\n[71:2](sbe2613.htm#fr_191) While making over the she-goat to the Soma-seller\nwith his left hand, he receives the Soma with the right.\n\n[72:1](sbe2613.htm#fr_192) Saya _n_ a takes a-a _g_ in the sense of 'to go to,\nto come' (a _g_ a, the corner); because the sacrificer through her comes to\nSoma.\n\n[72:2](sbe2613.htm#fr_193) See part i, introduction, p. xix, note 4.\n\n[72:3](sbe2613.htm#fr_194) 'For those same Gandharvas, the overseers of the\nGuardians of Soma, they are (meant) in lieu of those (? hearth-mounds), for\nthose are their names: it is to them that he thereby assigns those (objects\nconstituting the purchase-price), and thus he becomes debtless towards them.'\n[Ka _n_ va](errata.htm#0) text. See also part i, p. 183, note 2.\n\n[73:1](sbe2613.htm#fr_195) See [III, 2, 1, 16](sbe2607.htm#3:2:1:16). His wife\ndoes the same.\n\n[73:2](sbe2613.htm#fr_196) According to a former passage ([III, 1, 3,\n28](sbe2605.htm#3:1:3:28)), the sacrificer is supposed to remain in the\nembryonic state till the pressing of the Soma. The Ka _n_ va recension reads,\n'Sa etam ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ am a _g_ i _g_ anat sa esha garbho bhavaty a sutyaya _h_\n;' where 'a _g_ i _g_ anat' seems to mean 'he has begotten.' I am not quite\ncertain whether Soma himself is really implied. See [III, 3, 4,\n6](sbe2614.htm#3:3:4:6).\n\n[74:1](sbe2613.htm#fr_197) Compare the slightly different verse, Rig-veda VI,\n51, 16.\n\n[74:2](sbe2613.htm#fr_198) The sacrificer carries the bundle of Soma on his\nhand resting on his head.\n\n[74:3](sbe2613.htm#fr_199) Viz. the vessel of water mentioned [III, 1, 2,\n2](sbe2604.htm#3:1:2:2).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 4.
