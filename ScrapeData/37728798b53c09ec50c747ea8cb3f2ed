They belong to the constituent members, as the bases.\n\nA doubt arises whether meditations such as the one enjoined in the text, 'Let\nhim meditate on the syllable Om as the Udgitha,' which are connected with\nconstituent elements of the sacrifice such as the Udgitha, contribute towards\nthe accomplishment of the sacrifice, and hence must be performed at the\nsacrifice as part of it; or whether they, like the godohana vessel, benefit\nthe agent apart from the sacrifice, and therefore may be undertaken according\nto desire.--But has it not been already decided under III, 3, 42 that those\nmeditations are generally beneficial to man, and not therefore restricted to\nthe sacrifices?--True; it is just for the purpose of further confirming that\nconclusion that objections are now raised against it on the ground of some\ninferential marks (linga) and reasoning. For there it was maintained on the\nstrength of the text 'therefore he does both' that those meditations have\nresults independent of the sacrifice. But there are several reasons favouring\nthe view that those meditations must be connected with the sacrifices as\nsubordinate members, just as the Udgitha and the rest to which the meditations\nrefer.\n\nTheir case is by no means analogous to that of the godohana vessel, for, while\nin the case of the latter, the text expressly declares the existence of a\nspecial result, 'For him who is desirous of cattle he is to bring water in a\ngodohana,' the texts enjoining those meditations do not state special results\nfor them. For clauses such as 'he is to meditate on the Udgitha' intimate only\nthat the Udgitha is connected with the meditation; while their connexion with\ncertain results is known from other clauses, such as 'whatever he does with\nknowledge, with faith, with the\n\np. 683\n\n[paragraph continues] Upanishad, that is more vigorous' (according to which\nthe result of such meditations is only to strengthen the result of the\nsacrifices). And when a meditation of this kind has, on the ground of its\nconnexion with the Udgitha or the like--which themselves are invariably\nconnected with sacrifices--been cognised to form an element of a sacrifice,\nsome other passage which may declare a fruit for that meditation can only be\ntaken as an arthavada; just as the passage which declares that he whose\nsacrificial ladle is made of par _n_ a wood does not hear an evil sound. In\nthe same way, therefore, as the Udgitha and so on, which are the bases of\nthose meditations, are to be employed only as constituent parts of the\nsacrifices, so the meditations also connected with those constituent parts are\nthemselves to be employed as constituent parts of the sacrifices only.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 60.
