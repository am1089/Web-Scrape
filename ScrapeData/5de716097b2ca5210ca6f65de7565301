Now, some people enter upon the fast 3 when\n\np. 8\n\nthey (still) see (the moon, on the fourteenth day of the half-month),\nthinking, 'To-morrow he will not rise,'--either on account of clouds or not\nhaving ascertained properly, they enter upon the fast, and (in the morning) he\nrises over him. Now if he (the moon) should rise on (the material for) the\noblation being not yet taken out, then that approved (procedure is followed)\nand the same fasting-observance. The sour curds from last night's milking they\nuse for coagulating the sacrificial food 1; they let the calves join (their\nmothers), and drive them away again 2.\n\n11:1:4:22\\. In the afternoon he drives them away with the par _n_ a-branch;\nand as there that approved oblation of the New-moon offering (is prepared) so\nhere. But if he should not care to undergo (again) the fasting-observance, or\nif (the moon) were to rise over (the material for) the oblation already taken\nout, then let him do otherwise: having properly cleansed the rice-grains of\nthe husks, he cooks the smaller ones as a cake on eight potsherds for Agni Dat\n_ri_ (the Giver).\n\n11:1:4:33\\. And the sour curds (from the milk) milked on the day before (he\nprepares) for Indra Pradat _ri_\n\np. 9\n\n[paragraph continues] (the Bestower); and those (larger) rice-grains 1 he\ncooks in boiled fresh milk as a pap for Vish _n_ u _S_ ipivish _t_ a (the\nBald); for a pap it is whenever rice-grains are thrown (into milk or sour\ncurds).\n\n11:1:4:44\\. And as to this being so, it is because that moon is no other than\nKing Soma, the food of the gods;--he (the Sacrificer) at that time sought to\nsecure him 2, and missed him: Agni, the Giver, gives that (moon) to him, and\nIndra, the Bestower, bestows that one upon him; Indra and Agni give that\n(moon, Soma) as a sacrifice to him, and that sacrifice given by Indra and Agni\nhe offers. And as to why (he offers) to Vish _n_ u, the Bald, it is because\nVish _n_ u is the sacrifice; and as to why to the Bald 3 ( _s_ ipivish _t_ a),\n--it is that his missing him whom he sought to secure is the bald part (? _s_\nipita) of the sacrifice, hence to the Bald one. And on this occasion he should\ngive (to the priests) as much as he is able to give, for no oblation, they\nsay, should be without a dakshi _n_ a. And let him observe the fast just (on\nthe day) when he (the moon) does not rise.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[7:3](sbe44006.htm#fr_90) As, for the Full-moon offering, the Sacrificer\nshould enter on p. 8 the fast at the very time of full moon (I, 6, 3, 34), so,\nfor the New-moon offering, he should do so at the time when the last sign of\nthe moon has disappeared, cf. I, 6, 4, 14.\n\n[8:1](sbe44006.htm#fr_91) Literally, they make it the means of coagulating the\nhavis; that is to say, they put the sour-milk (of last night's milking) into\nthe milk obtained from the milking of this, the second, day so as to produce\nthe sour curds required on the next, or offering-day. See I, 6, 4, 6\nseq.;--purvedyu _h_ saya _m_ dugdha _m_ payo yad dadhy atmana vidyate parasmin\ndivase puna _h_ kara _n_ iyasya saya _m_ doharupasya havisha ata _\xc3\xb1_ _k_\nanartha _m_ kuryu _h_ , Say.\n\n[8:2](sbe44006.htm#fr_92) See I, 7, 1, 1 seq. The milk of the evening milking\nwill be required for the sour curds and whey to be mixed with the sweet\n(boiled) milk of the following morning in the preparation of the Sannayya.\n\n[9:1](sbe44006.htm#fr_93) According to Katy. _S_ rautas. XXV, 4, 40, the rice-\ngrains are sorted in three different sizes; those of medium size being used\nfor Agni Dat _ri_ , the largest for Indra Pradat _ri_ , and the smallest for\nVish _n_ u _S_ ipivish _t_ a.\n\n[9:2](sbe44006.htm#fr_94) That is, at the time of new moon when Soma is\nsupposed to stay on earth.\n\n[9:3](sbe44006.htm#fr_95) The native dictionaries also assign the meaning\n'affected by a skin-disease' to ' _s_ ipivish _t_ a.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 1, 5.
