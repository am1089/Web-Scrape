The Simantonnayana (or parting of the pregnant wife's hair, is performed)\nin her first pregnancy, in the fourth month.\n\n2\\. (The husband) serves food to Brahma _n_ as and causes them to pronounce\nauspicious wishes; then, after (the ceremonies) from the putting (of wood) on\nthe fire down to the \xc3\x82 _g_ yabhaga oblations (have been performed), he offers\nthe oblations (indicated in the) next (Mantras, M. II, 11, 1-8), while (the\nwife) takes hold of him, and enters upon the (performance) of the _G_ aya and\nfollowing oblations.\n\n3\\. Having performed (the rites) down to the sprinkling (of water) round (the\nfire), he makes her sit down to the west of the fire, facing the east, and\nparts her hair upwards (i.e. beginning from the front) with a porcupine's\nquill that has three white spots,\n\np. 280\n\nwith three Darbha blades, and with a bunch of unripe Udumbara fruits, with the\nVyah _ri_ tis or with the two next (verses, II, 11, 9. 10).\n\n4\\. He says to two lute-players, 'Sing!'\n\n5\\. Of the next two (verses, II, 11, 11. 12) the first (is to be sung on this\noccasion) among the (people of the) Salvas.\n\n6. 6 The second (is to be used) for Brahma _n_ as; and the river near which they dwell is to be named.\n\n7. 7 He ties barley-grains with young shoots (to the head of the wife); then she keeps silence until the stars appear.\n\n8\\. When the stars have appeared, he goes (with his wife) towards the east or\nnorth, touches a calf, and murmurs the Vyah _ri_ tis; then she breaks her\nsilence.\n\n9\\. The Pu _m_ savana (i.e. the ceremony to secure the birth of a male child)\nis performed when the pregnancy has become visible, under the constellation\nTishya.\n\n10\\. From a branch of a Nyagrodha tree, which points eastward or northward, he\ntakes a shoot with two (fruits that look like) testicles. The putting (of\nwood) on the fire, &c., is performed as at the Simantonnayana (Sutra 2).\n\n11\\. He causes a girl who has not yet attained maturity to pound (the\nNyagrodha shoot) on an upper mill-stone with another upper mill-stone, and to\npour water on it; then he makes his wife lie\n\np. 281\n\ndown on her back to the west of the fire, facing the east, and inserts (the\npounded substance) with his thumb into her right nostril, with the next Ya _g_\nus (II, 11, 13).\n\n12\\. Then she will give birth to a son.\n\n13\\. Here follows the ceremony to secure a quick deliverance.\n\n14\\. With a shallow cup that has not been used before, he draws water in the\ndirection of the river's current; at his wife s feet he lays down a Turyanti\nplant; he should then touch his wife, who is soon to be delivered, on the\nhead, with the next Ya _g_ us (II, 11, 14), and should sprinkle her with the\nwater, with the next (three) verses (II, 11, 15-17).\n\n15\\. Yadi _g_ arayu na pated eva _m_ vihitabhir evadbhir uttarabhyam (II, 11,\n18. 19) avokshet.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[280:6](sbe30107.htm#fr_767) \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana I, 14, 7; Paraskara I, 15, 8.\nComp.
