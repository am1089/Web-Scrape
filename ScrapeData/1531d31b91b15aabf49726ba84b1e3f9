XXXVII.\n\nDestruction of the Yadavas. \xc5\x9aamba and others deceive and ridicule the Rishis.\nThe former bears an iron pestle: it is broken, and thrown into the sea. The\nYadavas go to Prabhasa by desire of Krishn\xcc\x81a: they quarrel and fight, and all\nperish. The great serpent \xc5\x9aesha issues from the mouth of Rama. Krishn\xcc\x81a is\nshot by a hunter, and again becomes one with universal spirit.\n\nIN this manner did Krishn\xcc\x81a, assisted by Baladeva, destroy demons and\niniquitous monarchs, for the good of the earth; and along with Phalguna 1 also\ndid he relieve earth of her load, by the death of innumerable hosts. Having\nthus lightened the burdens of the earth, and slain many unrighteous princes,\nhe exterminated 2, by the pretext of an imprecation denounced by Brahmans, his\nown Yadava race. Then quitting Dwaraka, and relinquishing his mortal being,\nthe self-born reentered, with all his emanations, his own sphere of Vishn\xcc\x81u.\n\nMAITREYA.--Tell me how Janarddana effected the destruction of his own race\nunder the plea of Brahmanical imprecation, and in what manner he relinquished\nhis mortal body 3.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--At the holy place Pin\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81araka 4, Viswamitra, Kan\xcc\x81wa, and the great\nsage Narada, were observed by some boys of the Yadu tribe. Giddy with youth,\nand influenced by predestined results, they dressed and adorned Sumba, the son\nof Jambavati, as a damsel, and conducting her to the sages, they addressed\nthem with the usual marks of reverence, and said, "What child will this\nfemale, the wife of Babhru, who is\n\np. 607\n\nanxious to have a son, give birth to?" The sages, who were possessed of divine\nwisdom, were very angry to find themselves thus tricked by the boys, and said,\n"She will bring forth a club, that shall crush the whole of the Yadava race."\nThe boys, thus spoken to by the sages, went and related all that had occurred\nto Ugrasena; and, as foretold, a club was produced from the belly of \xc5\x9aamba.\nUgrasena had the club, which was of iron, ground to dust, and thrown into the\nsea; but the particles of dust there became rushes 5. There was one part of\nthe iron club which was like the blade of a lance, and which the Andhakas\ncould not break: this, when thrown into the sea, was swallowed by a fish; the\nfish was caught, the iron spike was extracted from its belly, and was taken by\na hunter named Jara. The all-wise and glorious Madhusudana did not think fit\nto counteract what had been predetermined by fate.\n\nThen there came to Ke\xc5\x9bava, when he was private and alone, a messenger from the\ngods, who addressed him with reverence, and said, "I am sent to you, O lord,\nby the deities, and do thou hear what Indra, together with the Vi\xc5\x9bwas, Maruts,\n\xc3\x81dityas, Sadhyas, and Rudras, respectfully represents. [ ](errata.htm#27)More\nthan a hundred years have elapsed since thou, in favour to the gods, hast\ndescended upon earth, for the purpose of relieving it of its load. The demons\nhave been slain, and the burden of earth has been removed: now let the\nimmortals once again behold their monarch in heaven. A period exceeding a\ncentury has passed: now, if\n\np. 608\n\nit be thy pleasure, return to Swarga. This is the solicitation of the\ncelestials. But should such not be thy will, then remain here as long as it\nmay be desirable to thy dependants 6." To this Krishn\xcc\x81a replied, "All that\nthou hast said I am well aware of. The destruction of the Yadavas by me has\ncommenced. The burdens of the earth are not removed until the Yadavas are\nextirpated. I will effect this also in my descent, and quickly; for it shall\ncome to pass in seven nights. When I have restored the land of Dwaraka to the\nocean, and annihilated the race of Yadu, I will proceed to the mansions of the\nimmortals. Apprise the gods, that, having abandoned my human body, and\naccompanied by Sankarshan\xcc\x81a, I will then return to them. The tyrants that\noppressed the earth, Jarasandha and the rest, have been killed; and a youth,\neven of the race of Yadu, is, no less than they, an incumbrance. When\ntherefore I have taken away this great weight upon earth, I will return to\nprotect the sphere of the celestials. Say this to them." The messenger of the\ngods, having received this reply, bowed, and took his heavenly course to the\nking of the gods.\n\nThe mighty Krishn\xcc\x81a now beheld signs and portents both in earth and heaven,\nprognosticating, day and night, the ruin of Dwaraka 7.\n\np. 609\n\n[paragraph continues] Shewing these to the Yadavas, he said, "See; behold\nthese fearful phenomena: let us hasten to Prabhasa, to avert these omens."\nWhen he had thus spoken to the eminent Yadava, the illustrious Uddhava saluted\nand said to him, "Tell me, O lord, what it is proper that I should do, for it\nseems to me that thou wilt destroy all this race: the signs that are manifest\ndeclare nothing less than the annihilation of the tribe." Then Krishn\xcc\x81a\nreplied to him, "Do you go by a celestial route, which my favour shall provide\nyou, to the holy place Badarika\xc5\x9brama, in the Gandhamadana mountain, the shrine\nof Naranarayan\xcc\x81a; and on that spot, sanctified by them, thou, by meditating on\nme, shalt obtain perfection through my favour. When the race of Yadu shall\nhave perished, I shall proceed to heaven; and the ocean shall inundate\nDwaraka, when I have quitted it." Accordingly Uddhava, thus instructed by\nKe\xc5\x9bava, saluted him with veneration, and departed to the shrine of\nNaranarayan\xcc\x81a 8.\n\nThen the Yadavas ascended their rapid cars, and drove to Prabhasa 9, along\nwith Krishn\xcc\x81a, Rama, and the rest of their chiefs 10. They bathed there, and,\nexcited by Vasudeva, the Kukkuras and Andhakas indulged in liquor. As they\ndrank, the destructive flame of dissension was kindled amongst them by mutual\ncollision, and fed with the fuel of abuse. Infuriated by the divine influence,\nthey fell upon one another with missile weapons, and when those were expended,\nthey had recourse to the rushes growing nigh. The rushes in their hands became\nlike thunderbolts,\n\np. 610\n\nand they struck one another with them fatal blows. Pradyumna, \xc5\x9aamba,\nKritavarman, Satyaki, Aniruddha, Prithu, Viprithu, Charuvarman, Charuka,\nAkrura, and many others, struck one another with the rushes, which had assumed\nthe hardness of thunderbolts 11. Ke\xc5\x9bava interposed to prevent them, but they\nthought that he was taking part with each severally, and continued the\nconflict. Krishn\xcc\x81a then enraged took up a handful of rushes to destroy them,\nand the rushes became a club of iron, and with this he slew many of the\nmurderous Yadavas; whilst others, fighting fiercely, put an end to one\nanother. The chariot of the holder of the discus, named Jaitra, was quickly\ncarried off by the swift steeds, and swept away by the sea, in the sight of\nDaruka the charioteer. The discus, the club, the bow, the quiver, the shell,\nand the sword of Ke\xc5\x9bava, having circumambulated their lord, flew along the\npath of the sun. In a short time there was not a single Yadava left alive,\nexcept the mighty Krishn\xcc\x81a and Daruka 12. Going towards Rama, who\n\np. 611\n\nwas sitting at the root of a tree, they beheld a large serpent coming out of\nhis mouth. Having issued from his mouth, the mighty snake proceeded towards\nthe ocean, hymned by saints and by other great serpents. Bringing an offering\nof respect, Ocean came to meet him; and then the majestic being, adored by\nattendant snakes, entered into the waters of the deep. Beholding the departure\nof the spirit of Balabhadra, Ke\xc5\x9bava said to Daruka, "All this is to be related\nby you to Vasudeva and Ugrasena. Go and inform them of the departure of\nBalabhadra, and the destruction of the Yadavas; also that I shall engage in\nreligious meditation, and quit this body. Apprise \xc3\x81huka and all the\ninhabitants of Dwaraka 13, that the sea will inundate the town: be ready\ntherefore in expectation of the coming of Arjuna, and when he quits Dwaraka,\nno longer abide there, but go whithersoever that descendant of Kuru shall\nrepair. Do you also go to the son of Kunti, and tell him, that it is my\nrequest that he will grant what protection he can to all my family. Then\ndepart with Arjuna and all the people of Dwaravati, and let Vajra be installed\nsovereign over the tribe of Yadu."\n\nDaruka, being thus instructed, prostrated himself again and again before\nKrishn\xcc\x81a, and walked round him repeatedly, and then departed as he had been\ndesired; and having conducted Arjuna to Dwaravati, the intelligent servant of\nKrishn\xcc\x81a established Vajra as king. The divine Govinda then, having\nconcentrated in himself that supreme spirit which is one with Vasudeva, was\nidentified with all beings 14. Respecting the words of the Brahman, the\nimprecation of Durvasas 15, the illustrious\n\np. 612\n\n[paragraph continues] Krishn\xcc\x81a sat engaged in thought, resting his foot upon\nhis knee. Then came there a hunter, named Jara 16, whose arrow was tipped with\na blade made of the piece of iron of the club, which had not been reduced to\npowder; and beholding from a distance the foot of Krishn\xcc\x81a, he mistook it for\npart of a deer, and shooting his arrow, lodged it in the sole 17. Approaching\nhis mark, he saw the four-armed king, and, falling at his feet, repeatedly\nbesought his forgiveness, exclaiming, "I have done this deed unwittingly,\nthinking I was aiming at a deer! Have pity upon me, who am consumed by my\ncrime; for thou art able to consume me!" Bhagavat replied, "Fear not thou in\nthe least. Go, hunter, through my favour, to heaven, the abode of the gods."\nAs soon as he had thus spoken, a celestial car appeared, and the hunter,\nascending it, forthwith proceeded to heaven. Then the illustrious Krishn\xcc\x81a,\nhaving united himself with his own pure, spiritual, inexhaustible,\ninconceivable, unborn, undecaying, imperishable, and universal spirit, which\nis one with Vasudeva, abandoned his mortal body and the condition of the\nthreefold qualities 18.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[606:1](vp154.htm#fr_1566) A name of Arjuna, the great friend of Krishn\xcc\x81a, to\nwhom the latter served as charioteer in the war between the Pan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81us and\nKurus.\n\n[606:2](vp154.htm#fr_1567) With Balarama, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, and the rest.\n\n[606:3](vp154.htm#fr_1568) The legend of the destruction of the Yadava race,\nand the death of Krishn\xcc\x81a, appears probably in its earliest extant form in the\nMau\xc5\x9bala Parva of the Mahabharata. It forms the narrative portion of the\neleventh book of the Bhagavata, having been previously briefly adverted to in\nthe first and third books; and it is summarily told in the Uttara Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a of\nthe Padma P.\n\n[606:4](vp154.htm#fr_1569) The village of Pin\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81araka, still held in\nveneration, is situated in Guzerat, about twenty miles from the north-west\nextremity of the Peninsula. Hamilton, II. 664.\n\n[607:5](vp154.htm#fr_1570) The term is Eraka, which is explained in some\nmedical lexicons, \'a kind of grass.\' The commentator also calls it a kind of\ngrass: and in the text of the Mahabharata the term subsequently used, and as\nsynonymous with it, is Trin\xcc\x81a, \'grass.\' The Mahabharata, when describing the\naffray which follows, mentions that the grass or rushes, on being plucked by\nKrishn\xcc\x81a and the Yadavas, turn to clubs. The text, and that of the Bhagavata,\nhere say, that the powdered particles, floating on the sea, became rushes; or\nthe latter may imply, that they fastened upon grass or weeds. The commentator,\nhowever, explains that the particles of iron being borne to land, they were so\ntransformed. The Mahabharata says nothing of the piece which could not be\npounded, and this seems to be an embellishment either of our text or the\nBhagavata. The Mahabharata, however, adds another precaution, which the two\nothers have left unnoticed. Ugrasena causes a proclamation to be made, that\nnone of the inhabitants of Dwaraka shall thenceforth drink wine, on pain of\nbeing impaled alive: and the people for some time observe the prohibition.\n\n[608:6](vp154.htm#fr_1571) Nothing of this kind occurs in the Mahabharata: our\ntext therefore offers an embellishment. The Bhagavata, again, improves upon\nthe text; for, not content with a messenger, it makes Brahma with the\nPrajapatis, \xc5\x9aiva with the Bhutas, Indra with the other divinities, all come in\nperson; indicating evidently a later date, as plainly as the addition of the\ntext shews it to be subsequent to the date of the legend in the Mahabharata.\n\n[608:7](vp154.htm#fr_1572) The Mahabharata, which delights in describing\nportents and signs, does not fail to detail them here. A dreadful figure,\ndeath personified, haunts every house, coming and going no one knows how, and\nbeing invulnerable to the weapons by which he is assailed. Strong hurricanes\nblow; large rats multiply, and infest the roads and houses, and attack persons\nin their sleep; Sarikas, or starlings, utter inauspicious screams in their\ncages; storks imitate the hooting of owls, and goats the howling of jackals;\ncows bring forth foals, and camels mules; food, in the moment of being eaten,\nis filled with worms; fire burns with discoloured flames; and at sunset and\nsunrise the air is traversed by headless and hideous spirits. There is more to\nthe same effect, which neither our text nor the Bhagavata has ventured to\ndetail. The whole passage has been published in Maurice\'s Ancient History of\nHindustan, II. 463; translated apparently p. 609 by the late Sir Charles\nWilkins. The names have been much disfigured either by the copyist or\ncompositor.\n\n[609:8](vp154.htm#fr_1573) In the Mahabharata it is said merely that Uddhava,\nwho was versed in Yoga, foreseeing the destruction of the Yadavas, went away;\nthat is, according to the commentator, he practised penance, and went to\nheaven. The Bhagavata, taking the hint, makes much more of it than our text,\nand expands it into a long course of instruction given by Krishn\xcc\x81a to Uddhava,\noccupying 150 leaves.\n\n[609:9](vp154.htm#fr_1574) See [p. 561](vp138.htm#page_561). n.\n[3](vp138.htm#fn_1520). By sending the Yadavas to Prabhasa, the commentator\nasserts, Krishn\xcc\x81a prevented purposely the Yadavas from obtaining Mukti, \'final\nliberation,\' which would have been the consequence of dying at Dwaraka. Death\nat Prabhasa conferred only Indra\'s heaven.\n\n[609:10](vp154.htm#fr_1575) The Mahabharata describes them as going forth with\nhorses, elephants, and cars, and their women, and abundance of good cheer, and\nvarieties of wine and meat.\n\n[610:11](vp154.htm#fr_1576) The Bhagavata, like the text, adverts only in this\ngeneral manner to the conflict; but the Mahabharata gives the particulars.\nYuyudhana reproaches Kritavarman with having aided Aswatthaman in his night\nattack on the Pan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81u camp, and killing warriors in their sleep. Pradyumna\njoins in the abuse. Kritavarman retorts. Krishn\xcc\x81a looks at him angrily.\nSatyaki repeats the story of the \xc5\x9ayamantaka gem, by which he accuses\nKritavarman of being an accomplice in the murder of Satrajit ([p.\n428](vp106.htm#page_428)). Satyabhama, the daughter of the latter, then mixes\nin the quarrel, and incites Krishn\xcc\x81a to avenge her; but Satyaki anticipates\nhim, and murders Kritavarman. Saineya and the Bhojas attack Satyaki; the\nAndhakas defend him; and the affray becomes general. Krishn\xcc\x81a attempts to part\nthe combatants, until Pradyumna is killed; and then taking up a handful of\nrushes, which become an iron club, he kills indiscriminately all that come in\nhis way. The conflict continues until the greater part of the combatants have\nfallen, including all Krishn\xcc\x81a\'s sons, and he then in wrath sweeps off all the\nsurvivors, except Babhru and Daruka, with his discus.\n\n[610:12](vp154.htm#fr_1577) The Mahabharata, as observed at the end of the\nlast note, adds Babhru, but it presently gets rid of him. Krishn\xcc\x81a sends him\nto take care of the old people, the women, and children, in Dwaraka, whilst\nDaruka goes to bring Arjuna to their aid: but as he goes along, overcome with\ngrief for the loss of his kindred, and approaching separation from Krishn\xcc\x81a,\nhe is killed by a club that is cast from a snare or trap set by a hunter.\nKrishn\xcc\x81a then goes to Dwaraka, and desires Vasudeva to await the coming of\nArjuna; after which he returns to Rama, and sees the phenomenon described in\nthe text; the serpent being \xc5\x9aesha, of whom Balarama was the incarnation. The\nBhagavata does not mention this incident, p. 611 merely observing that Rama,\nby the power of Yoga, returned into himself; that is, into Vishn\xcc\x81u.\n\n[611:13](vp154.htm#fr_1578) The women, the elders, and the children, amongst\nwhom, as we shall presently see, was Vajra, the son of Aniruddha, who was\nestablished as chief of the Yadavas at Indraprastha, and who therefore escaped\nthe destruction which overwhelmed their kinsmen, the Vrishn\xcc\x81is, Kukkuras, and\nAndhakas, of Dwaraka. This was a fortunate reservation for the tribes which in\nvarious parts of Hindustan, both on the Ganges and in the Dakhin, profess to\nderive their origin from the Yadavas.\n\n[611:14](vp154.htm#fr_1579) The process is explained by the commentator: \'By\nthe force of Dhyana, or abstraction, Krishn\xcc\x81a satisfies himself that he is\nBrahma, or universal spirit; and is next convinced that he is therefore all\nthings; by which his individuality ceases.\'\n\n[611:15](vp154.htm#fr_1580) The story is told in the Mahabharata, Durvasas was\non one occasion hospitably p. 612 entertained by Krishn\xcc\x81a, but the latter\nomitted to wipe away the fragments of the meal which had fallen on the foot of\nthe irascible sage, who thereupon foretold that Krishn\xcc\x81a should be killed as\nin the text.\n\n[612:16](vp154.htm#fr_1581) This is an allegorical personage, however, for\nJara signifies \'infirmity,\' \'old age,\' \'decay.\'\n\n[612:17](vp154.htm#fr_1582) The Bhagavata explains how this part of the foot\nbecame exposed. Krishn\xcc\x81a had assumed one of the postures in which abstraction\nis practised: he had laid his left leg across his right thigh, by which the\nsole of the foot was turned outwards.\n\n[612:18](vp154.htm#fr_1583) He became Nirgun\xcc\x81a, \'devoid of all qualities.\'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXXVIII](vp155.htm)\n\n'
