VI.\n\nMeans of attaining liberation. Anecdotes of Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikya and Ke\xc5\x9bidhwaja. The\nformer instructs the latter how to atone for permitting the death of a cow.\nKe\xc5\x9bidhwaja offers him a requital, and he desires to be instructed in spiritual\nknowledge.\n\nHE, Purushottama, is also known by holy study and devout meditation; and\neither, as the cause of attaining him, is entitled Brahma. From study let a\nman proceed to meditation, and from meditation to study 1; by perfection in\nboth supreme spirit becomes manifest. Study is one eye wherewith to behold it,\nand meditation is the other: he who is one with Brahma sees not with the eye\nof flesh.\n\nMAITREYA.--Reverend teacher, I am desirous of being informed what is meant by\nthe term meditation (Yoga), by understanding which I may behold the supreme\nbeing, the upholder of the universe.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--I will repeat to you, Maitreya, the explanation formerly given by\nKe\xc5\x9bidhwaja to the magnanimous Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikya, also called Janaka.\n\nMAITREYA.--Tell me first, Brahman, who Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikya was, and who was\nKe\xc5\x9bidhwaja; and how it happened that a conversation relating to the practice\nof Yoga occurred between them.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--There was Janaka, named Dharmadhwaja, who had two sons, Amitadhwaja\nand Kritadhwaja; and the latter was a king ever intent upon existent supreme\nspirit: his son was the celebrated Ke\xc5\x9bidhwaja. The son of Amitadhwaja was\nJanaka, called Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikya 2.\n\np. 646\n\n[paragraph continues] Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikya was diligent in the way of works, and was\nrenowned on earth for religious rites. Ke\xc5\x9bidhwaja, on the other hand, was\nendowed with spiritual knowledge. These two were engaged in hostilities, and\nKhan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikya was driven from his principality by Ke\xc5\x9bidhwaja. Expelled from his\ndominions, he wandered with a few followers, his priest and his counsellors,\namidst woods and mountains, where, destitute of true wisdom, he performed many\nsacrifices, expecting thereby to obtain divine truth, and to escape from death\nby ignorance 3.\n\nOnce whilst the best of those who are skilled in devotion, Ke\xc5\x9bidhwaja, was\nengaged in devout exercises, a fierce tiger slew his milch cow 4 in the lonely\nforest. When the Raja heard that the cow had been killed, he asked the\nministering priests what form of penance would expiate the crime. They replied\nthat they did not know, and referred him to Ka\xc5\x9beru. Ka\xc5\x9beru, when the Raja\nconsulted him, told him that he knew not, but that Sunaka would be able to\ntell him. Accordingly the Raja went to Sunaka; but he replied, "I am as\nunable, great king, to answer your question as Ka\xc5\x9beru has been; and there is\nno one now upon earth who can give you the information except your enemy\nKhan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikya, whom you have conquered."\n\nUpon receiving this answer, Ke\xc5\x9bidhwaja said, "I will go, then, and pay a visit\nto my foe: if he kill me, no matter, for then I shall obtain the reward that\nattends being killed in a holy cause: if, on the contrary, he tell me what\npenance to perform, then my sacrifice will be unimpaired in efficacy."\nAccordingly he ascended his car, having clothed himself in the deer skin (of\nthe religious student), and went to the forest where the wise Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikya\nresided. When Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikya beheld him approach, his eyes reddened with rage,\nand he took up his bow, and said to him, "You have armed yourself with the\ndeer skin to accomplish my\n\np. 647\n\ndestruction, imagining that in such an attire you will be safe from me; but,\nfool, the deer, upon whose backs this skin is seen, are slain by you and me\nwith sharp arrows: so will I slay you; you shall not go free whilst I am\nliving. You are an unprincipled felon, who have robbed me of my kingdom, and\nare deserving of death." To this Ke\xc5\x9bidhwaja answered, "I have come hither,\nKhan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikya, to ask you to solve my doubts, and not with any hostile\nintention: lay aside therefore both your arrow and your anger." Thus spoken\nto, Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikya retired a while with his counsellors and his priest, and\nconsulted with them what course to pursue. They strongly urged him to slay\nKe\xc5\x9bidhwaja, who was now in his power, and by whose death he would again become\nthe monarch of the whole earth. Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikya replied to them, "It is no doubt\ntrue that by such an act I should become the monarch of the whole earth: he,\nhowever, would thereby conquer the world to come; whilst the earth would be\nmine. Now if I do not kill him, I shall subdue the next world, and leave him\nthis earth. It seems to me that this world is not of more value than the next;\nfor the subjugation of the next world endures for ever; the conquest over this\nis but for a brief season. I will therefore not kill him, but tell him what he\nwishes to know."\n\nReturning then to Ke\xc5\x9bidhwaja, Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikya desired him to propose his question,\nwhich he promised to answer; and Ke\xc5\x9bidhwaja related to him what had happened,\nthe death of the cow, and demanded to know what penance he should perform.\nKhan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikya, in reply, explained to him fully the expiation that was suited to\nthe occasion; and Ke\xc5\x9bidhwaja then, with his permission, returned to the place\nof sacrifice, and regularly fulfilled every necessary act. Having completed\nthe ceremony, with its supplementary rites, Ke\xc5\x9bidhwaja accomplished all his\nobjects: but he then reflected thus: "The priests whom I invited to attend\nhave all been duly honoured; all those who had any request to make have been\ngratified by compliance with their desires; all that is proper for this world\nhas been effected by me: why then should my mind feel as if my duty had been\nunfulfilled?" So meditating, he remembered that he had not presented to\nKhan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikya the gift that it is becoming to offer to a spiritual preceptor,\nand, mounting his chariot, he immediately set off to\n\np. 648\n\nthe thick forest where that sage abode. Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikya, upon his reappearance,\nassumed his weapons to kill him; but Ke\xc5\x9bidhwaja exclaimed, "Forbear, venerable\nsage. I am not here to injure you, Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikya: dismiss your wrath, and know\nthat I have come hither to offer you that remuneration which is due to you as\nmy instructor. Through your lessons I have fully completed my sacrifice, and I\nam therefore desirous to give you a gift. Demand what it shall be."\n\nKhan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikya having once more communed with his counsellors, told them the\npurpose of his rival\'s visit, and asked them what he should demand. His\nfriends recommended him to require his whole kingdom back again, as kingdoms\nare obtained by prudent men without conflicting hosts. The reflecting king\nKhan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikya laughed, and replied to them, "Why should a person such as I be\ndesirous of a temporary earthly kingdom? Of a truth you are able counsellors\nin the concerns of this life, but of those of the life to cone you are\nassuredly ignorant." So speaking, he went back to Ke\xc5\x9bidhwaja, and said to him,\n"Is it true that you wish to make me a gift, as to your preceptor?" "Indeed I\ndo," answered Ke\xc5\x9bidhwaja. "Then," rejoined Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikya, "as it is known that\nyou are learned in the spiritual learning that teaches the doctrine of the\nsoul, if you will communicate that knowledge to me, you will have discharged\nyour debt to your instructor. Declare to me what acts are efficacious for the\nalleviation of human affliction."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[645:1](vp161.htm#fr_1632) Both study of the Vedas (Swadhyaya) and abstraction\n(Yoga) are to be practised: when a man is weary of one, he may apply to the\nother. The Yoga, however, limits the practical part to silent prayer. \'Wearied\nof meditation, let him pray inaudibly: weary of prayer, let him repeat\nmeditation.\' \'By the union of prayer and meditation let him behold soul in\nhimself.\'\n\n[645:2](vp161.htm#fr_1633) No such names occur amongst the Maithila kings of\nthe Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a (see [p. 390](vp097.htm#page_390)); but, as there noticed\n(note [6](vp097.htm#fn_1025)), the Bhagavata inserts them. Janaka is used as a\ntitle. Kritadhwaja, in some of the copies, is read Ritadhwaja.\n\n[646:3](vp161.htm#fr_1634) The performance of rites as a means of salvation is\ncalled ignorance in the Vedas (see [p. 642](vp160.htm#page_642), n.\n[7](vp160.htm#fn_1628)). Works are recommended as introductory to the\nacquirement of knowledge: it is ignorance to consider them as finite.\n\n[646:4](vp161.htm#fr_1635) Tasya-dhenum. One copy has Homa-dhenu, \'cow of\nsacrifice;\' another, Dharma-dhenu, \'cow of righteousness.\' The commentator\nexplains the terms as importing the same thing, a cow yielding milk for holy\npurposes, or for the butter which is poured in oblations upon the sacrificial\nfire.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VII](vp162.htm)\n\n'
