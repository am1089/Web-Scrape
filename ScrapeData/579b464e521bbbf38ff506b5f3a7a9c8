They are born for retirement [1](sbe46123.htm#an_5:19:1:1). Out of the\ncover he [2](sbe46123.htm#an_5:19:1:2) has shone forth, being a cover himself.\nIn the lap of the mother he looks about [3](sbe46123.htm#an_5:19:1:3).\n\n2\\. Causing him to discern (the pious and the impious?), they have sacrificed.\nWith unwinking eyes they protect his manly power. They have penetrated into\nthe firm stronghold [1](sbe46123.htm#an_5:19:2:1).\n\n3\\. The people of _S_ vaitreya [1](sbe46123.htm#an_5:19:3:1), his clans, have\nthriven brilliantly. B _ri_ haduktha with a golden ornament at his neck, is\neager for the race as if by this honey-drink [2](sbe46123.htm#an_5:19:3:2).\n\n4\\. Like the dear milk of love [1](sbe46123.htm#an_5:19:4:1)--(a thing)\nunrelated with two (things) related [2](sbe46123.htm#an_5:19:4:2)--like the\ngharma vessel with booty in its belly--undeceived, the deceiver of all\n[3](sbe46123.htm#an_5:19:4:3).\n\n5\\. Sporting, O beam of light, appear to us, joined with the ash, with the\nwind. May those well sharpened \xe2\x80\xa6 of his, standing on \xe2\x80\xa6, be sharp like\xe2\x80\xa6\n[1](sbe46123.htm#an_5:19:5:1).\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe _Ri_ shi is Vavri \xc3\x82treya (cf. verse 1. pra vavre _h_ vavri _h_ _k_ iketa).\nThe metre is Gayatri in verses 1, 2, Anush _t_ ubh in verses 3, 4, Vira _d_\nrupa in verse 5.--No verse occurs in the other Sa _m_ hitas.\n\nThis Sukta seems to be anything rather than an ordinary Agni hymn. It may be a\ncollection of verses belonging to an \xc3\x82khyana, or of verses serving another\npurpose which we can scarcely hope to discover. In several parts of this\n\np. 408\n\n[paragraph continues] Sukta I must content myself with translating the words\nwithout being able to elucidate the poet's meaning.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. I translate the noun avastha\xc2\xb4 in accordance with the Vedic meaning of\nthe verb ava-stha. Possibly it means the secret parts, cf. avastha, AV. VII,\n90, 3 (B.-R.). Ludwig translates: 'Ein zustand erzeugt einen andern,' and\nparaphrases, 'Nur zustande und formen, gestalten lernen wir kennen, das wesen\ndes gottes bleibt uns verborgen.' This seems too modern. Prof. Max Muller\nproposes: 'The remnants (afterbirth) have been brought forth. Skin has shone\nforth from skin.'--On the question who are the beings 'born for retirement,' I\ndo not venture any conjecture.\n\nNote 2. Is Agni meant?\n\nNote 3. Cf. X, 5, 1. (Agni _h_ ) asmat hrida _h_ bhu\xc2\xb4ri _g_ anma vi _k_ ash\n_t_ e.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. The meaning seems to be that the worshippers (possibly the first\nworshippers, the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras), by discovering Agni and by worshipping him, have\nconquered the hostile strongholds.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. _S_ vaitreya is mentioned as a victorious hero also in I, 33, 14.\n\nNote 2. Does this phrase allude to the rite of offering, at the Va _g_ apeya\nsacrifice, to the horses that were going to run the sacred race, a naivara _k_\naru? In the Mantras connected with this rite the words occur: 'Drink of this\nhoney-drink' (asya madhva _h_ pibata). See Rig-veda VII, 38, 8; Taittiriya Sa\n_m_ hita I, 7, 8, 2; Weber, Ueber den Va _g_ apeya, p. 30.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. The retas?\n\nNote 2. Does this refer to an offering or the like, composed of two substances\nrelated among each other (such as\n\np. 409\n\nmilk and butter), and a third substance unrelated (such as rice)? Of course\nall this is absolutely uncertain.\n\nNote 3. Is this Agni?\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. The meaning of dh _ri_ sha _g_ , vakshi\xc2\xb4, vaksha _n_ estha\xc2\xb4 is\nunknown.--On the first hemistich of this verse, compare Pischel Vedische\nStudien, II, 54.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 20](sbe46124.htm)\n\n"
