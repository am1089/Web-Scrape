THE AUTHOR AND THE PLAY\n\nCONCERNING the life, the date, and the very identity 1 of King Sh\xc5\xabdraka, the\nreputed author of The Little Clay Cart, we are curiously ignorant. No other\nwork is ascribed to him, and we have no direct information about him, beyond\nthe somewhat fanciful statements of the Prologue to this play. There are, to\nbe sure, many tales which cluster about the name of King Sh\xc5\xabdraka, but none of\nthem represents him as an author. Yet our very lack of information may prove,\nto some extent at least, a disguised blessing. For our ignorance of external\nfact compels a closer study of the text, if we would find out what manner of\nman it was who wrote the play. And the case of King Sh\xc5\xabdraka is by no means\nunique in India; in regard to every great Sanskrit writer,\xc2\x97so bare is Sanskrit\nliterature of biography,\xc2\x97we are forced to concentrate attention on the man as\nhe reveals himself in his works. First, however, it may be worth while to\ncompare Sh\xc5\xabdraka with two other great dramatists of India, and thus to\ndiscover, if we may, in what ways he excels them or is excelled by them.\n\nK\xc4\x81lid\xc4\x81sa, Sh\xc5\xabdraka, Bhavabh\xc5\xabti\xc2\x97assuredly, these are the greatest names in the\nhistory of the Indian drama. So different are these men, and so great, that it\nis not possible to assert for any one of them such supremacy as Shakspere\nholds in the English drama. It is true that K\xc4\x81lid\xc4\x81sa\'s dramatic masterpiece,\nthe Shakuntal\xc4\x81, is the most widely known of the Indian plays. It is true that\nthe tender and elegant K\xc4\x81lid\xc4\x81sa has been called, with a not wholly fortunate\n\np. xvi\n\nenthusiasm, the "Shakspere of India." But this rather exclusive admiration of\nthe Shakuntal\xc4\x81 results from lack of information about the other great Indian\ndramas. Indeed, it is partly due to the accident that only the Shakuntal\xc4\x81\nbecame known in translation at a time when romantic Europe was in full\nsympathy with the literature of India.\n\nBhavabh\xc5\xabti, too, is far less widely known than K\xc4\x81lid\xc4\x81sa; and for this the\nreason is deeper-seated. The austerity of Bhavabh\xc5\xabti\'s style, his lack of\nhumor, his insistent grandeur, are qualities which prevent his being a truly\npopular poet. With reference to K\xc4\x81lid\xc4\x81sa, he holds a position such as\nAeschylus holds with reference to Euripides. He will always seem to minds that\nsympathize with his grandeur 1 the greatest of Indian poets; while by other\nequally discerning minds of another order he will be admired, but not\npassionately loved.\n\nYet however great the difference between K\xc4\x81lid\xc4\x81sa, "the grace of poetry," 2\nand Bhavabh\xc5\xabti, "the master of eloquence," 3 these two authors are far more\nintimately allied in spirit than is either of them with the author of The\nLittle Clay Cart. K\xc4\x81lid\xc4\x81sa and Bhavabh\xc5\xabti are Hindus of the Hindus; the\nShakuntal\xc4\x81 and the Latter Acts of R\xc4\x81ma could have been written nowhere save in\nIndia: but Sh\xc5\xabdraka, alone in the long line of Indian dramatists, has a\ncosmopolitan character. Shakuntal\xc4\x81 is a Hindu maid, M\xc4\x81dhava is a Hindu hero;\nbut Sansth\xc4\x81naka and Maitreya and Madanik\xc4\x81 are citizens of the world. In some\nof the more striking characteristics of Sanskrit literature\xc2\x97in its fondness\nfor system, its elaboration of style, its love of epigram\xc2\x97K\xc4\x81lid\xc4\x81sa and\nBhavabh\xc5\xabti are far truer\n\np. xvii\n\nto their native land than is Sh\xc5\xabdraka. In Sh\xc5\xabdraka we find few of those\nsplendid phrases in which, as the Chinese 1 say, it is only the words which\nstop, the sense goes on,"\xc2\x97phrases like K\xc4\x81lid\xc4\x81sa\'s 2 "there are doors of the\ninevitable everywhere," or Bhavabh\xc5\xabti\'s 3 "for causeless love there is no\nremedy." As regards the predominance of swift-moving action over the poetical\nexpression of great truths, The Little Clay Cart stands related to the Latter\nActs of R\xc4\x81ma as Macbeth does to Hamlet. Again, Sh\xc5\xabdraka\'s style is simple and\ndirect, a rare quality in a Hindu; and although this style, in the passages of\nhigher emotion, is of an exquisite simplicity, yet Sh\xc5\xabdraka cannot infuse into\nmere language the charm which we find in Kal\xc4\xabd\xc4\x81sa or the majesty which we find\nin Bhavabh\xc5\xabti.\n\nYet Sh\xc5\xabdraka\'s limitations in regard to stylistic power are not without their\ncompensation. For love of style slowly strangled originality and enterprise in\nIndian poets, and ultimately proved the death of Sanskrit literature. Now just\nat this point, where other Hindu writers are weak, Sh\xc5\xabdraka stands forth\npreeminent. Nowhere else in the hundreds of Sanskrit dramas do we find such\nvariety, and such drawing of character, as in The Little Clay Cart; and\nnowhere else, in the drama at least, is there such humor. Let us consider, a\nlittle more in detail, these three characteristics of our author; his variety,\nhis skill in the drawing of character, his humor.\n\nTo gain a rough idea of Sh\xc5\xabdraka\'s variety, we have only to recall the names\nof the acts of the play. Here The Shampooer who Gambled and The Hole in the\nWall are shortly followed by The Storm; and The Swapping of the Bullock-carts\nis closely succeeded by The Strangling of Vasantasen\xc4\x81. From farce to tragedy,\nfrom\n\np. xviii\n\nsatire to pathos, runs the story, with a breadth truly Shaksperian. Here we\nhave philosophy:\n\n_The lack of money is the root of all evil_. ( _i. 14_ )\n\nAnd pathos:\n\n_My body wet by tear-drops falling, falling;  \n  My limbs polluted by the clinging mud;  \nFlowers from the graveyard torn, my wreath appalling;  \nFor ghastly sacrifice hoarse ravens calling,  \n  And for the fragrant incense of my blood_. ( _x. 3_ )\n\nAnd nature description:\n\n   _But mistress, do not scold the lightning. She is your friend_ ,\n\n_This golden cord that trembles on the breast  \nOf great Air\xc4\x81vata; upon the crest  \nOf rocky hills this banner all ablaze;  \nThis lamp in Indra\'s palace; but most blest  \nAs telling where your most beloved stays_. (v. 33)\n\nAnd genuine bitterness:\n\n_Pride and tricks and lies and fraud  \n  Are in your face;  \nFalse playground of the lustful god,  \n  Such is your face;  \nThe wench\'s stock in trade, in fine,  \nEpitome of joys divine,  \n  I mean your face  \nFor sale! the price is courtesy.  \nI trust you\'ll find a man to buy  \n    Your face_. ( _v. 36_ )\n\nIt is natural that Sh\xc5\xabdraka should choose for the expression of matters so\ndiverse that type of drama which gives the greatest scope to the author\'s\ncreative power. This type is the so-called\n\np. xix\n\n"drama of invention," 1 a category curiously subordinated in India to the\nheroic drama, the plot of which is drawn from history or mythology. Indeed,\nThe Little Clay Cart is the only extant drama which fulfils the spirit of the\ndrama of invention, as defined by the Sanskrit canons of dramaturgy. The plot\nof the "M\xc4\x81lat\xc4\xab and M\xc4\x81dhava," or of the "Mallik\xc4\x81 and M\xc4\x81ruta," is in no true\nsense the invention of the author; and The Little Clay Cart is the only drama\nof invention which is "full of rascals." 2\n\nBut a spirit so powerful as that of King Sh\xc5\xabdraka could not be confined within\nthe strait jacket of the minute, and sometimes puerile, rules of the technical\nworks. In the very title of the drama, he has disregarded the rule 3 that the\nname of a drama of invention should be formed by compounding the names of\nheroine and hero. 4 Again, the books prescribe 5 that the hero shall appear in\nevery act; yet Ch\xc4\x81rudatta does not appear in acts ii., iv., vi., and viii. And\nfurther, various characters, Vasantasen\xc4\x81, Maitreya, the courtier, and others,\nhave vastly gained because they do not conform too closely to the technical\ndefinitions.\n\nThe characters of The Little Clay Cart are living men and women. Even when the\ntype makes no strong appeal to Western minds, as in the case of Ch\xc4\x81rudatta,\nthe character lives, in a sense in which Dushyanta 6 or even R\xc4\x81ma 7 can hardly\nbe said to live. Sh\xc5\xabdraka\'s men are better individualized than his women; this\nfact alone differentiates him sharply from other Indian dramatists. He draws\non every class of society, from the high-souled Brahman to the executioner and\nthe housemaid.\n\nHis greatest character is unquestionably Sansth\xc4\x81naka, this combination\n\np. xx\n\nof ignorant conceit, brutal lust, and cunning, this greater than Cloten, who,\nafter strangling an innocent woman, can say: 1 "Oh, come! Let\'s go and play in\nthe pond." Most attractive characters are the five 2 conspirators, men whose\nhome is "east of Suez and the ten commandments." They live from hand to mouth,\nready at any moment to steal a gem-casket or to take part in a revolution, and\npreserving through it all their character as gentlemen and their irresistible\nconceit. And side by side with them moves the hero Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, the Buddhist\nbeau-ideal of manhood,\n\n_A tree of life to them whose sorrows grow,  \nBeneath its fruit of virtue bending low_. ( _i. 48_ )\n\nTo him, life itself is not dear, but only honor. 3 He values wealth only as it\nsupplies him with the means of serving others. We may, with some justice,\ncompare him with Antonio in The Merchant of Venice. There is some\ninconsistency, from our point of view, in making such a character the hero of\na love-drama; and indeed, it is Vasantasen\xc4\x81 who does most of the love-making.\n4\n\nVasantasen\xc4\x81 is a character with neither the girlish charm of Shakuntal\xc4\x81 5 nor\nthe mature womanly dignity of S\xc4\xabt\xc4\x81. 6 She is more admirable than lovable.\nWitty and wise she is, and in her love as true as steel; this too, in a social\nposition which makes such constancy difficult. Yet she cannot be called a\ngreat character; she does not seem so true to life as her clever maid,\nMadanik\xc4\x81. In making the heroine of his play a courtezan, Sh\xc5\xabdraka follows a\nsuggestion of the technical works on the drama; he does not thereby cast any\nimputation of ill on Vasantasen\xc4\x81\'s character. The courtezan class in India\ncorresponded roughly to the hetaerae of\n\np. xxi\n\nancient Greece or the geishas of Japan; it was possible to be a courtezan and\nretain one\'s self-respect. Yet the inherited 1 way of life proves distasteful\nto Vasantasen\xc4\x81; her one desire is to escape its limitations and its dangers by\nbecoming a legal wife. 2\n\nIn Maitreya, the Vid\xc5\xabshaka, we find an instance of our author\'s masterly skill\nin giving life to the dry bones of a rhetorical definition. The Vid\xc5\xabshaka is a\nstock character who has something in common with a jester; and in Maitreya the\nessential traits of the character\xc2\x97eagerness for good food and other creature\ncomforts, and blundering devotion to his friend\xc2\x97are retained, to be sure, but\nclarified and elevated by his quaint humor and his readiness to follow\nCh\xc4\x81rudatta even in death. The grosser traits of the typical Vid\xc5\xabshaka are\nlacking. Maitreya is neither a glutton nor a fool, but a simple-minded, whole-\nhearted friend.\n\nThe courtier is another character suggested by the technical works, and\ntransformed by the genius of Sh\xc5\xabdraka. He is a man not only of education and\nsocial refinement, but also of real nobility of nature. But he is in a false\nposition from the first, this true gentleman at the wretched court of King\nP\xc4\x81laka; at last he finds the courage to break away, and risks life, and all\nthat makes life attractive, by backing Aryaka. Of all the conspirators, it is\nhe who runs the greatest risk. To his protection of Vasantasen\xc4\x81 is added a\ntouch of infinite pathos when we remember that he was himself in love with\nher. 3 Only when Vasantasen\xc4\x81 leaves him 4 without a thought, to enter\nCh\xc4\x81rudatta\'s house, does he realize how much he loves her; then, indeed, he\nbreaks forth in words of the most passionate jealousy. We need not linger over\nthe other characters, except to observe that each has his marked\nindividuality,\n\np. xxii\n\nand that each helps to make vivid this picture of a society that seems at\nfirst so remote.\n\nSh\xc5\xabdraka\'s humor is the third of his vitally distinguishing qualities. This\nhumor has an American flavor, both in its puns and in its situations. The\nplays on words can seldom be adequately reproduced in translation, but the\nsituations are independent of language. And Sh\xc5\xabdraka\'s humor runs the whole\ngamut, from grim to farcical, from satirical to quaint. Its variety and\nkeenness are such that King Sh\xc5\xabdraka need not fear a comparison with the\ngreatest of Occidental writers of comedies.\n\nIt remains to say a word about the construction of the play. Obviously, it is\ntoo long. More than this, the main action halts through acts ii. to v., and\nduring these episodic acts we almost forget that the main plot concerns the\nlove of Vasantasen\xc4\x81 and Ch\xc4\x81rudatta. Indeed, we have in The Little Clay Cart\nthe material for two plays. The larger part of act i. forms with acts vi. to\nx. a consistent and ingenious plot; while the remainder of act i. might be\ncombined with acts iii. to v. to make a pleasing comedy of lighter tone. The\nsecond act, clever as it is, has little real connection either with the main\nplot or with the story of the gems. The breadth of treatment which is\nobservable in this play is found in many other specimens of the Sanskrit\ndrama, which has set itself an ideal different from that of our own drama. The\nlack of dramatic unity and consistency is often compensated, indeed, by\nlyrical beauty and charms of style; but it suggests the question whether we\nmight not more justly speak of the Sanskrit plays as dramatic poems than as\ndramas. In The Little Clay Cart, at any rate, we could ill afford to spare a\nsingle scene, even though the very richness and variety of the play remove it\nfrom the class of the world\'s greatest dramas.\n\np. xxiii\n\n#### II. THE TRANSLATION\n\nTHE following translation is sufficiently different from previous translations\nof Indian plays to require a word of explanation. The difference consists\nchiefly in the manner in which I have endeavored to preserve the form of the\noriginal. The Indian plays are written in mingled prose and verse; and the\nverse portion forms so large a part of the whole that the manner in which it\nis rendered is of much importance. Now this verse is not analogous to the\niambic trimeter of Sophocles or the blank verse of Shakspere, but roughly\ncorresponds to the Greek choruses or the occasional rhymed songs of the\nElizabethan stage. In other words, the verse portion of a Sanskrit drama is\nnot narrative; it is sometimes descriptive, but more commonly lyrical: each\nstanza sums up the emotional impression which the preceding action or dialogue\nhas made upon one of the actors. Such matter is in English cast into the form\nof the rhymed stanza; and so, although rhymed verse is very rarely employed in\nclassical Sanskrit, it seems the most appropriate vehicle for the translation\nof the stanzas of a Sanskrit drama. It is true that we occasionally find\nstanzas which might fitly be rendered in English blank verse, and, more\nfrequently, stanzas which are so prosaic as not to deserve a rendering in\nEnglish verse at all. 1 But, as the present translation may be regarded as in\nsome sort an experiment, I have preferred to hold rigidly to the distinction\nfound in the original between simple prose and types of stanza which seem to\nme to correspond to English rhymed verse.\n\nIt is obvious that a translation into verse, and especially into rhymed verse,\ncannot be as literal as a translation into prose; this\n\np. xxiv\n\ndisadvantage I have used my best pains to minimize. I hope it may be said that\nnothing of real moment has been omitted from the verses; and where lack of\nmetrical skill has compelled expansion, I have striven to make the additions\nas insignificant as possible.\n\nThere is another point, however, in which it is hardly feasible to imitate the\noriginal; this is the difference in the dialects used by the various\ncharacters. In The Little Clay Cart, as in other Indian dramas, some of the\ncharacters speak Sanskrit, others Pr\xc4\x81krit. Now Pr\xc4\x81krit is the generic name for\na number of dialects derived from the Sanskrit and closely akin to it. The\ninferior personages of an Indian play, and, with rare exceptions, all the\nwomen, speak one or another of these Pr\xc4\x81krits. Of the thirty characters of\nthis play, for example, only five (Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, the courtier, Aryaka,\nSharvilaka, and the judge) speak Sanskrit; 1 the others speak various Pr\xc4\x81krit\ndialects. Only in the case of Sansth\xc4\x81naka have I made a rude attempt to\nsuggest the dialect by substituting _sh_ for _s_ as he does. And the\ngrandiloquence of Sharvilaka\'s Sanskrit in the satirical portion of the third\nact I have endeavored to imitate.\n\nWhenever the language of the original is at all technical, the translator\nlabors under peculiar difficulty. Thus the legal terms found in the ninth act\nare inadequately rendered, and, to some extent at least, inevitably so; for\nthe legal forms, or lack of forms, pictured there were never contemplated by\nthe makers of the English legal vocabulary. It may be added here that in\nrendering from a literature so artificial as the Sanskrit, one must lose not\nonly the sensuous beauty of the verse, but also many plays on words.\n\nIn regard to the not infrequent repetitions found in the text, I\n\np. xxv\n\nhave used my best judgment. Such repetitions have been given in full where it\nseemed to me that the force or unity of the passage gained by such treatment,\nor where the original repeats in full, as in the case of v. 7, which is\nidentical with iii. 29. Elsewhere, I have merely indicated the repetition\nafter the manner of the original.\n\nThe reader will notice that there was little effort to attain realism in the\npresentation of an Indian play. He need not be surprised therefore to find\n(page [145](lcc15.htm#page_145)) that V\xc4\xabraka leaves the courtroom, mounts a\nhorse, rides to the suburbs, makes an investigation and returns\xc2\x97all within the\nlimits of a stage-direction. The simplicity of presentation also makes\npossible sudden shifts of scene. In the first act, for example, there are six\nscenes, which take place alternately in Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\'s house and in the street\noutside. In those cases where a character enters "seated" or "asleep," I have\nsubstituted the verb "appear" for the verb "enter"; yet I am not sure that\nthis concession to realism is wise.\n\nThe system of transliteration which I have adopted is intended to render the\npronunciation of proper names as simple as may be to the English reader. The\nconsonants are to be pronounced as in English, 1 the vowels as in Italian.\nDiacritical marks have been avoided, with the exception of the macron. This\nsign has been used consistently 2 to mark long vowels except e and o, which\nare always long. Three rules suffice for the placing of the accent. A long\npenult is accented: Maitreya, Ch\xc4\x81rudatta. If the penult is short, the\nantepenult is accented provided it be long: Sanstha\xcc\x84naka. If both penult and\nantepenult of a four-syllabled word are short, the pre-antepenultimate\nreceives the accent: Madanik\xc4\x81, Stha\xcc\x84,varaka.\n\np. xxvi\n\n#### III. AN OUTLINE OF THE PLOT\n\nAct I., entitled _The Gems are left Behind_. Evening of the first day.\xc2\x97After\nthe prologue, Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, who is within his house, converses with his friend\nMaitreya, and deplores his poverty. While they are speaking, Vasantasen\xc4\x81\nappears in the street outside. She is pursued by the courtier and Sansth\xc4\x81naka;\nthe latter makes her degrading offers of his love, which she indignantly\nrejects. Ch\xc4\x81rudatta sends Maitreya from the house to offer sacrifice, and\nthrough the open door Vasantasen\xc4\x81 slips unobserved into the house. Maitreya\nreturns after an altercation with Sansth\xc4\x81naka, and recognizes Vasantasen\xc4\x81.\nVasantasen\xc4\x81 leaves a casket of gems in the house for safe keeping and returns\nto her home.\n\nAct II., entitled _The Shampooer who Gambled_. Second day.\xc2\x97The act opens in\nVasantasen\xc4\x81\'s house. Vasantasen\xc4\x81 confesses to her maid Madanik\xc4\x81 her love for\nCh\xc4\x81rudatta. Then a shampooer appears in the street, pursued by the gambling-\nmaster and a gambler, who demand of him ten gold-pieces which he has lost in\nthe gambling-house. At this point Darduraka enters, and engages the gambling-\nmaster and the gambler in an angry discussion, during which the shampooer\nescapes into Vasantasen\xc4\x81\'s house. When Vasantasen\xc4\x81 learns that the shampooer\nhad once served Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, she pays his debt; the grateful shampooer resolves\nto turn monk. As he leaves the house he is attacked by a runaway elephant, and\nsaved by Karnap\xc5\xabraka, a servant of Vasantasen\xc4\x81.\n\nAct III., entitled _The Hole in the Wall_. The night following the second\nday.\xc2\x97Ch\xc4\x81rudatta and Maitreya return home after midnight from a concert, and go\nto sleep. Maitreya has in his hand the gem-casket which Vasantasen\xc4\x81 has left\nbehind. Sharvilaka enters. He is in love with Madanik\xc4\x81, a maid of\nVasantasen\xc4\x81\'s, and is resolved\n\np. xxvii\n\nto acquire by theft the means of buying her freedom. He makes a hole in the\nwall of the house, enters, and steals the casket of gems which Vasantasen\xc4\x81 had\nleft. Ch\xc4\x81rudatta wakes to find casket and thief gone. His wife gives him her\npearl necklace with which to make restitution.\n\nAct IV., entitled _Madanik \xc4\x81 and Sharvilaka_. Third day.\xc2\x97Sharvilaka comes to\nVasantasen\xc4\x81\'s house to buy Madanik\xc4\x81\'s freedom. Vasantasen\xc4\x81 overhears the facts\nconcerning the theft of her gem-casket from Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\'s house, but accepts\nthe casket, and gives Madanik\xc4\x81 her freedom. As Sharvilaka leaves the house, he\nhears that his friend Aryaka, who had been imprisoned by the king, has escaped\nand is being pursued. Sharvilaka departs to help him. Maitreya comes from\nCh\xc4\x81rudatta with the pearl necklace, to repay Vasantasen\xc4\x81 for the gem-casket.\nShe accepts the necklace also, as giving her an excuse for a visit to\nCh\xc4\x81rudatta.\n\nAct V., entitled _The Storm_. Evening of the third day.\xc2\x97Ch\xc4\x81rudatta appears in\nthe garden of his house. Here he receives a servant of Vasantasen\xc4\x81, who\nannounces that Vasantasen\xc4\x81 is on her way to visit him. Vasantasen\xc4\x81 then\nappears in the street with the courtier; the two describe alternately the\nviolence and beauty of the storm which has suddenly arisen. Vasantasen\xc4\x81\ndismisses the courtier, enters the garden, and explains to Ch\xc4\x81rudatta how she\nhas again come into possession of the gem-casket. Meanwhile, the storm has so\nincreased in violence that she is compelled to spend the night at Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\'s\nhouse.\n\nAct VI., entitled _The Swapping of the Bullock-carts_. Morning of the fourth\nday.\xc2\x97Here she meets Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\'s little son, Rohasena. The boy is peevish\nbecause he can now have only a little clay cart to play with, instead of finer\ntoys. Vasantasen\xc4\x81 gives him her gems to buy a toy cart of gold. Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\'s\nservant drives up to\n\np. xxviii\n\ntake Vasantasen\xc4\x81 in Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\'s bullock-cart to the park, where she is to\nmeet Ch\xc4\x81rudatta; but while Vasantasen\xc4\x81 is making ready, he drives away to get\na cushion. Then Sansth\xc4\x81naka\'s servant drives up with his master\'s cart, which\nVasantasen\xc4\x81 enters by mistake. Soon after, Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\'s servant returns with\nhis cart. Then the escaped prisoner Aryaka appears and enters Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\'s\ncart. Two policemen come on the scene; they are searching for Aryaka. One of\nthem looks into the cart and discovers Aryaka, but agrees to protect him. This\nhe does by deceiving and finally maltreating his companion.\n\nAct VII., entitled _Aryaka\'s Escape_. Fourth day.\xc2\x97Ch\xc4\x81rudatta is awaiting\nVasantasen\xc4\x81 in the park. His cart, in which Aryaka lies hidden, appears.\nCh\xc4\x81rudatta discovers the fugitive, removes his fetters, lends him the cart,\nand leaves the park.\n\nAct VIII., entitled _The Strangling of Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Fourth day.\xc2\x97A Buddhist\nmonk, the shampooer of the second act, enters the park. He has difficulty in\nescaping from Sansth\xc4\x81naka, who appears with the courtier. Sansth\xc4\x81naka\'s\nservant drives in with the cart which Vasantasen\xc4\x81 had entered by mistake. She\nis discovered by Sansth\xc4\x81naka, who pursues her with insulting offers of love.\nWhen she repulses him, Sansth\xc4\x81naka gets rid of all witnesses, strangles her,\nand leaves her for dead. The Buddhist monk enters again, revives Vasantasen\xc4\x81,\nand conducts her to a monastery.\n\nAct IX., entitled _The Trial_. Fifth day.\xc2\x97Sansth\xc4\x81naka accuses Ch\xc4\x81rudatta of\nmurdering Vasantasen\xc4\x81 for her money. In the course of the trial, it appears\nthat Vasantasen\xc4\x81 had spent the night of the storm at Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\'s house; that\nshe had left the house the next morning to meet Ch\xc4\x81rudatta in the park; that\nthere had been a struggle in the park, which apparently ended in the murder of\na woman. Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\'s friend, Maitreya, enters with the gems which\n\np. xxix\n\nVasantasen\xc4\x81 had left to buy Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\'s son a toy cart of gold. These gems\nfall to the floor during a scuffle between Maitreya and Sansth\xc4\x81naka. In view\nof Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\'s poverty, this seems to establish the motive for the crime, and\nCh\xc4\x81rudatta is condemned to death.\n\nAct X., entitled _The End_. Sixth day.\xc2\x97Two headsmen are conducting Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\nto the place of execution. Ch\xc4\x81rudatta takes his last leave of his son and his\nfriend Maitreya. But Sansth\xc4\x81naka\'s servant escapes from confinement and\nbetrays the truth; yet he is not believed, owing to the cunning displayed by\nhis master. The headsmen are preparing to execute Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, when Vasantasen\xc4\x81\nherself appears upon the scene, accompanied by the Buddhist monk. Her\nappearance puts a summary end to the proceedings. Then news is brought that\nAryaka has killed and supplanted the former king, that he wishes to reward\nCh\xc4\x81rudatta, and that he has by royal edict freed Vasantasen\xc4\x81 from the\nnecessity of living as a courtezan. Sansth\xc4\x81naka is brought before Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\nfor sentence, but is pardoned by the man whom he had so grievously injured.\nThe play ends with the usual Epilogue.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xv:1](lcc04.htm#fr_1) For an illuminating discussion of these matters, the\nreader is referred to Sylvain Levi\'s admirable work, Le Theatre Indien, Paris,\n1890, pages 196-211.\n\n[xvi:1](lcc04.htm#fr_2) In his M\xc4\x81lat\xc4\xabm\xc4\x81dhava, i. 8, he says: "Whoever they may\nbe who now proclaim their contempt for me,\xc2\x97they know something, but _this_\nwork was not for them. Yet there will arise a man of nature like mine own; for\ntime is endless, and the world is wide." This seems prophetic of John Milton.\n\n[xvi:2](lcc04.htm#fr_3) Prasannar\xc4\x81ghava, i. 22.\n\n[xvi:3](lcc04.htm#fr_4) Mah\xc4\x81v\xc4\xabracarita, i. 4.\n\n[xvii:1](lcc04.htm#fr_5) History of Chinese Literature, by H.
