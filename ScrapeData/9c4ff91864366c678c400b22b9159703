And on account of remembrance.\n\nThe philosopher who maintains that all things are momentary only would have to\nextend that doctrine to the perceiving person (upalabdh _ri_ ) also; that is,\nhowever, not possible, on account of the remembrance which is consequent on\nthe original perception. That remembrance can take place only if it belongs to\nthe same person who previously made the perception; for we observe that what\none man has experienced is not remembered by another man. How, indeed, could\nthere arise the conscious state expressed in the sentences, 'I saw that thing,\nand now I see this thing,' if the seeing person were not in both cases the\nsame? That the consciousness of recognition takes place only in the case of\nthe observing and remembering subject being one, is a matter known to every\none; for if there were, in the two cases, different subjects, the state of\nconsciousness arising in the mind of the remembering person would be, ' _I_\nremember; another person made the observation.' But no such state of\nconsciousness does arise.--When, on the other hand, such a state of\nconsciousness does arise, then everybody knows that the person who made the\noriginal observation, and the person who remembers, are different persons, and\nthen the state of consciousness is expressed as follows, 'I remember that that\nother person saw that and that.'--\n\np. 414\n\n[paragraph continues] In the case under discussion, however, the Vaina _s_ ika\nhimself--whose state of consciousness is, 'I saw that and that'--knows that\nthere is one thinking subject only to which the original perception as well as\nthe remembrance belongs, and does not think of denying that the past\nperception belonged to himself, not any more than he denies that fire is hot\nand gives light.\n\nAs thus one agent is connected with the two moments of perception and\nsubsequent remembrance, the Vaina _s_ ika has necessarily to abandon the\ndoctrine of universal momentariness. And if he further recognises all his\nsubsequent successive cognitions, up to his last breath, to belong to one and\nthe same subject, and in addition cannot but attribute all his past\ncognitions, from the moment of his birth, to the same Self, how can he\nmaintain, without being ashamed of himself, that everything has a momentary\nexistence only? Should he maintain that the recognition (of the subject as one\nand the same) takes place on account of the similarity (of the different self-\ncognitions; each, however, being momentary only), we reply that the cognition\nof similarity is based on two things, and that for that reason the advocate of\nuniversal momentariness who denies the existence of one (permanent) subject\nable mentally to grasp the two similar things simply talks deceitful nonsense\nwhen asserting that recognition is founded on similarity. Should he admit, on\nthe other hand, that there is one mind grasping the similarity of two\nsuccessive momentary existences, he would thereby admit that one entity\nendures for two moments and thus contradict the tenet of universal\nmomentariness.--Should it be said that the cognition 'this is similar to that'\nis a different (new) cognition, not dependent on the apperception of the\nearlier and later momentary existences, we refute this by the remark that the\nfact of different terms--viz. 'this' and 'that'--being used points to the\nexistence of different things (which the mind grasps in a judgment of\nsimilarity). If the mental act of which similarity is the object were an\naltogether new act (not concerned with the two separate similar entities), the\nexpression 'this is similar to that'\n\np. 415\n\nwould be devoid of meaning; we should in that case rather speak of\n'similarity' only.--Whenever (to add a general reflexion) something perfectly\nwell known from ordinary experience is not admitted by philosophers, they may\nindeed establish their own view and demolish the contrary opinion by means of\nwords, but they thereby neither convince others nor even themselves. Whatever\nhas been ascertained to be such and such must also be represented as such and\nsuch; attempts to represent it as something else prove nothing but the vain\ntalkativeness of those who make those attempts. Nor can the hypothesis of mere\nsimilarity being cognised account for ordinary empirical life and thought; for\n(in recognising a thing) we are conscious of it being that which we were\nformerly conscious of, not of it being merely similar to that. We admit that\nsometimes with regard to an external thing a doubt may arise whether it is\nthat or merely is similar to that; for mistakes may be made concerning what\nlies outside our minds. But the conscious subject never has any doubt whether\nit is itself or only similar to itself; it rather is distinctly conscious that\nit is one and the same subject which yesterday had a certain sensation and to-\nday remembers that sensation.--For this reason also the doctrine of the\nNihilists is to be rejected.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 26](sbe34202.htm)\n\n"
