On the supposition of there being no (cause: while yet the effect takes\nplace), there results contradiction of the admitted principle; otherwise\nsimultaneousness (of cause and effect).\n\nIt has been shown that on the doctrine of general non-permanency, the former\nmomentary existence, as having already been merged in non-existence, cannot be\nthe cause of the later one.--Perhaps now the Bauddha will say that an effect\nmay arise even when there is no cause.--That, we reply, implies the\nabandonment of a principle admitted by yourself, viz. that the mind and the\nmental modifications originate when in conjunction with four kinds of causes\n1. Moreover, if anything could originate without a cause, there would be\nnothing to prevent that anything might originate at any time.--If, on the\nother hand, you should say that we may assume the antecedent momentary\nexistence to last until the succeeding one has been produced, we point out\nthat that would imply the simultaneousness of cause and effect, and so run\ncounter to an accepted Bauddha tenet, viz. that all things  2 are momentary\nmerely.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[409:1](sbe34197.htm#fr_399) These four causes are the so-called defining\ncause (adhipatipratyaya), the auxiliary cause (sahakaripratyaya), the\nimmediate cause (samanantarapratyaya), and the substantial cause\n(alambanapratyaya).--I extract the explanation from the Brahmavidyabhara _n_\na: Adhipatir indriya _m_ tad dhi _k_ akshuradirupam utpannasya _g \xc3\xb1_anasya\nrupadivishayata _m_ niya _kkh_ ati niyamaka _s_ _k_ a loke#dhipatir ity u _k_\nyate.
