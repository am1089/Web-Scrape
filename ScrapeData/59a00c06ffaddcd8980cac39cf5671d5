Narada said :-- I have heard the one thousand names or nama stotras\nequivalent in its fruits to S\xc2\x92ri Gayatri, highly potent in making a good\nfortune and tending to a splendid increase of the wealth and prosperity. Now I\nwant to hear about how initiations in Mantrams are performed, without which\nnobody, be he a Brahmi _n_ , a K _s_ attriya, a Vais\xc2\x92ya or a S\xc2\x92udra, is\nentitled to have the Devi Mantra. O Lord! Kindly describe the ordinary\n(Samanya) and the special (vis\xc2\x92e _s_ a) rules thereof.\n\n\n\n4-41. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! Listen. I am now telling you about the\nrules of initiation (Dik _s_ a) of the disciples, pure in heart. When they are\ninitiated, they become entitled then and not before that, to worship the\nDevas, the Fire and the Guru. That method of instruction, and religious act\nand ceremony is called the Dik _s_ a (initiation) by which the Divine\nKnowledge is imparted; and at once flashes in the heart and mind of the\ninitiated that Knowledge and all his sins are then destroyed. So the Pundits\nof the Vedas and the Tantras, say. (The Divine Knowledge is like lightning,\nfire, arising and permeating the body, mind, and spirit.) This Dik _s_ a ought\nto be taken by all means. This gives excellent merits and pure results. Both\nthe Guru and the S\xc2\x92i _s_ ya (disciple) ought to be very pure and true. (This\nis the first essential requisite. Then the results are instantaneous). First\nof all, the Guru is to perform all the morning duties, he is to take his bath\nand perform his Sandhya Vandanams. He is to return home from the banks of the\nriver with his Kama _nd_ alu and observe maunam (silence). Then, in order to\ngive Dik _s_ a, he is to enter into the assigned room (Yaga Ma _nd_ apa) and\ntake his seat on an \xc3\x82sana that is excellent and calculated to please all. He\nis to perform \xc3\x82chanara and do Pra _n_ ayama. Then he should take water in his\nArghya vessel and putting scents and flowers in that, charge that water with\nPha _t_ kara mantra (that is, condense electricity Spirit in that). Then\nuttering the Pha _t_ mantra, he is to sprinkle the water on the doorways of\nthe worshiproom and begin his Puja. Firstly, on the top of the door at one end\ninvoke the Deity Ga _n_ anatha by His mantra, at the other end invoke\nSarasvati by Her mantra and at the middle, invoke Lak _s_ mi Devi by Her\nmantra duly and worship them, with flowers. Then, on the right side worship\nGanga and Bigh _n_ es\xc2\x92a; and on the left side worship K _s_ ettrapala and\nYamuna, the daughter of the Sun. Similarly, on the bottom of the door, worship\nthe Astra Devata by the\n\n\n\np. 1155\n\n\n\nPha _t_ mantra. Then consider the whole Ma _nd_ apa as inspired with the\npresence of the Devi, and see the whole place as pervaded by Her through and\nthrough. Then, repeat the Pha _t_ mantra and destroy the Celestial obstacles\nas well as those from the middle space (Antarik _s_ a); strike the ground\nthrice with the left heel and thus destroy the Terrene obstacles. Then\ntouching the left branch on the left side of the chouka _t_ , put the right\nfoot forward and enter into the Ma _nd_ apa. Then instal the S\xc2\x92anti Kumbha\n(the peace jar) and offer the ordinary Arghya (Samanyargha). Next worship the\nVastunatha and Padmayoni with flowers and \xc3\x82tapa rice and the Arghya water, on\nthe south-west and then purify the Pa _n_ cha Gavya. Next sprinkle all the Ma\n_nd_ apa and the entrance gate with that Arghya water. And, while sprinkling\nwith Arghya water, consider the whole space right through as inspired with the\npresence of the Devi and repeat the Mula Mantra with devotion and sprinkle\nwith Pha _t_ mantra. The Karta, then, uttering the mantra \xc2\x93Pha _t_ ,\xc2\x94 is to\ndrive away all the evils from the Ma _nd_ apa and uttering the mantra \xc2\x93Hum\xc2\x94\nsprinkle water, all around, thus pacifying the atmosphere and bringing peace\ninto the hearts of all present.\n\n\n\nThen burn the Dhupa incense inside and scatter Vikira (water, sandal-paste,\nyava, ashes, Durba grass with roots, and \xc3\x82tapa rice). Then collect all these\nrice, etc., again with a broom made of Kus\xc2\x92a grass to the north east corner of\nthe Ma _nd_ apa; making the Sankalpa and uttering Svasti vachana (invocation\nof good), distribute and satisfy the poor and orphans with feeding, clothing\nand money. Then he should bow down to his own Guru and take his seat humbly on\nthe soft \xc3\x82sanam allotted to him with his face eastwards and meditate on the\nDeity (\xc3\x8e _st_ a Deva) of the mantra that is to be imparted to the disciple.\nAfter meditating thus, he is to do the Bhuta s\xc2\x92uddhi (purification of\nelements) and perform Nyasa, etc., of the Deya mantra (the mantra that is to\nbe imparted to the disciple) according to the rules stated below, i.e., the Ri\n_s_ i on the head; the chhandas in the mouth, the \xc3\x8e _st_ a Devata in the\nheart, Bija on the anus and S\xc2\x92akti Nyasa on the two legs. Then he is to make\nsound thrice by the clap of his palm and thus thwart off all the evils of the\nearth and the middle space and then make digbandhan (tieing up the quarters)\nby the mudra chho _t_ ika three times (snapping the thumb and forefinger\ntogether ). Then perform the Pra _n_ ayama with the Mula mantra of the would-\nbe-\xc3\x8e _st_ a-Devata and do the Matrika Nyasa in one\xc2\x92s own body, thus :-- O _m_\nAm nama _h_ s\xc2\x92irasi, O _m_ \xc3\x82m nama _h_ on the face, O _m_ Im nama _h_ on the\nright eye, O _m_ \xc3\x8em nama _h_ on the left eye, and so on, assign all the\nletters duly to their respective places. Then perform the Karanga Nyasa on the\nfingers and the _S_ a _d_ a _n_ ga Nyasa thus :-- Speak: O _m_ Hridayaya nama\n_h_ , touching on the heart, utter O _m_ S\xc2\x92irase svaha, touching the head; O\n_m_\n\n\n\np. 1156\n\n\n\nS\xc2\x92ikhayai Va _s_ at, touching the tuft; O _m_ Kavachaya Hum, touching on the\nKavacha, \xc2\x93O _m_ netratrayaya Vau _s_ a _t_ ,\xc2\x94 touching the eye, and \xc2\x93O _m_\nAstraya Pha _t_ \xc2\x94 touching both the sides of the hand, the palm and its back.\nThen finish the Nayasa by doing the Var _n_ anyasa of the Mula mantra in those\nplaces that are said in the cognate kalpas (i.e., throat, heart, arms, legs,\netc.).\n\n\n\nO Narada! Next consider within your body the seat of an auspicious \xc3\x82sana (a\nseat) and make the Nyasa of Dharma on the right side, J\xc3\xb1ana _m_ on the left\nside, of Vairagyam (dispassion) on the left thigh, prosperity and wealth on\nthe right thigh, of non-Dharma in the mouth and of Non-J\xc3\xb1anam on the left\nside, Avairagyam (passion) on the navel, and poverty on the right side. Then\nthink of the feet of the \xc3\x82sana (the body) as Dharma, etc., and all the limbs\nas Adharma (non-Dharma). In the middle of the \xc3\x82sana (body), i.e., in the heart\nconsider Ananta Deva as a gentle bed and on that a pure lotus representing\nthis universe of five elements. Then make Nyasa of the Sun, Moon, and Fire on\nthis lotus and think the Sun as composed of twelve Kalas (digits) the Moon\ncomposed of sixteen Kalas (digits) and the Fire as composed of ten Kalas. Over\nthis make Nyasa of Sattva, Raja and Tamo Gu _n_ as, \xc3\x82tma, Antaratma, Paramatma\nand J\xc3\xb1anatma and then think of this as his \xc3\x8e _st_ a\xc2\x92s altar where the devotee\nis to meditate on his \xc3\x8e _st_ a Devata, the Highest Mother. Nyasa-assignment of\nthe various parts of the body to different deities which is usually\naccompanied with prayers and corresponding gesticulations. Next the devotee is\nto perform the mental worship of the Deya Mantra Devata according to the rules\nof his own Kalpa; next he is to show all the Mudras, stated in the Kalpa for\nthe satisfaction of the Deva. The Devas become very pleased when all these\nMudras are shown to them.\n\n\n\n42-46. O Narada! Now, on one\xc2\x92s left side, erect an hectagon; inside it a\ncircular figure; inside this again a square and then draw within that square a\ntriangle and over it show the S\xc2\x92ankha Mudra. After finishing the Puja of the\nSix Deities at the six corners of the hectagon, Fire, etc., take the tripod of\nthe S\xc2\x92ankha (conch-shell) and sprinkling it with Pha _t_ mantra, place it\nwithin the triangle. Utter, then, the Mantra \xc2\x93Ma _m_ Vahniman dalaya Das\xc2\x92a\nKalatmane Amuka Devya Arghyapatrasthanaya nama _h_ \xc2\x94 and thus worshipping the\nS\xc2\x92ankhya vessel place it within the ma _nd_ ala. Then worship in the S\xc2\x92ankha\npatra, the ten Kalas of Fire, beginning from the East, then south-east and so\non. Sprinkle the S\xc2\x92ankha, conchshell, with the Mula Mantra and meditating on\nit, place the S\xc2\x92ankha (conch shell) on the tripod. Repeating the mantra \xc2\x93Am\nSurya ma _nd_ alaya Dvadas\xc2\x92akalatmane Amukodevya\n\n\n\np. 1157\n\n\n\nArghyapatraya nama _h_ \xc2\x94 worship in the Arghyapatra S\xc2\x92ankha, sprinkle water in\nthe S\xc2\x92ankha with the Mantra \xc2\x93Sa _m_ S\xc2\x92ankhya nama _h_.\xc2\x94 Worship in due order\nthe twelve Kalas of the Sun Tapini, Tapini, Dhumra, etc., utter the fifty\nsyllables of the Matrika in an inverse order (i.e., beginning, see the Sarada\nTilaka, with K _s_ a _m_ , Ha _m_ , _S_ a _m_ , Sam, S\xc2\x92a _m_ , etc.,) and\nrepeating the Mula Mantra also in an inverse order, fill the S\xc2\x92ankha, three-\nfourths, with water. Next perform in it the Nyasa of Chandrakala and uttering\nthe Mantra \xc2\x93U _m_ Soma ma _nd_ alaya _S_ o _d_ as\xc2\x92akalatmane Amukademtaya\nArghya-mritaya nama _h_ ,\xc2\x94 worship in this conchshell. Next with Ankus\xc2\x92a\nmudra, invoke all the tirthas there, repeating the Mantra \xc2\x93Gange Cha Yamune\nchaiva, etc.,\xc2\x94 and repeat eight times the Mula Mantra (the basic Mantra). Then\nperform the S\xc2\x92a _d_ amga Nyasa in the water and with the Mantra \xc2\x93Hrida nama\n_h_ , etc.,\xc2\x94 worship and, repeating eight times the Mula Mantra, cover it with\nMatsyamundra. Next place on the right side of the S\xc2\x92ankha, the Prok _s_ a _n_\ni Patra (the Kos\xc2\x92a vessel from which water is taken for sprinkling) and put a\nlittle water in it. By this water sprinkle and purify all the articles of\nworship as well as one\xc2\x92s own body and consider one\xc2\x92s \xc3\x82tman as pure and holy.\n\n\n\n47-81. After doing works thus far the until Vis\xc2\x92e _s_ arghya is placed, the\ndevotee should erect Sarvato bhadra ma _nd_ ala within the altar and put the\nS\xc2\x92ali rice within its pericarp. Next spread Kus\xc2\x92a grass on that Ma _nd_ ala\nand put on one Kurcha, looking well and auspicious within it, made of twenty-\nseven Kus\xc2\x92a grass knotted with Venyagra granthi. Worship here the \xc3\x82dhara\nS\xc2\x92akti, Prakriti, Kurma, S\xc2\x92e _s_ a, K _s_ ama, Sudhasindhu, Ma _n_ ima _nd_\nala, Kalpa vrik _s_ a and \xc3\x8e _st_ a devata and the Pi _t_ ha. (Durga Devi yoga\npi _t_ haya nama _h_ ). Then have an entire kumbha (waterjar) having no\ndefect, wash it inside with Pha _t_ mantra, and encircle it with the red\nthread thrice as symbolising the three Gu _n_ as. Place within this jar the\nNava ratna (nine jewels) with Kurcha and worshipping it with scents and\nflowers put them in the jar repeating the Pra _n_ ava, and place that on the\nPi _t_ ha (seat). Next consider the Pitha and Kumbha (waterjar) as one and the\nsame and pour waters from the Tirthas, repeating in an inverse order the\nMatrika Var _n_ as (from K _s_ a to Ka) and fill it, thinking of the \xc3\x8e _st_ a\nDeva and repeating the basic mantra, put the new and fresh twigs (Pallavas) of\nAs\xc2\x92vattha, Panasa and mango trees, etc., in the jar and cover its mouth and\nplace over it fruits, rice, and cha _s_ aka (honey) and wrap it with two red\ncloths. Then perform the Pra _n_ a-Prati _st_ ha and invoke the Spirit of the\nDevi by the Pra _n_ asthapana Mantra and show the Mudras, \xc3\x82vahana, etc., and\nthus satisfy the Devi. Then do the _S_ o _d_ as\xc2\x92opachara Puja of the Devi\nafter me-\n\n\n\np. 1158\n\n\n\nditating on the Parames\xc2\x92vari according to the rules of the Kalpa.\n\n\n\nFirst offer \xc2\x93welcome\xc2\x94 in front of the Devi and then duly offer the Padya,\nArghya, \xc3\x82chamaniya water, Madhuparka, and oils, etc., for the bath. Then offer\nnice red silken clothes and various jewels, ornaments; repeating the Matrika\nsyllables electrified with the Deya Mantra, worship the whole body of the Devi\nwith scents and flowers. Next offer to the Devi the sweet scent of Kalaguru\nmixed with camphor and the Kas\xc2\x92miri sandalpaste mixed with Kasturi and various\nnice scented flowers, for example, the Ku _nd_ a flowers, etc. Then offer the\nDhupa prepared from Aguru, Guggula, Us\xc2\x92ira, sandalpaste, sugar, and honey and\nknow that the Dhupa is very pleasing to the Devi. Next offer various lights\nand offerings of fruits, vegetables and fooding. Be particular to sprinkle\neverything with the water of the Kosa, thus purifying, before it is offered to\nthe Devi. Then complete the A _n_ ga Puja, and the \xc3\x82vara _n_ a-Puja of the\nDevi, then perform the duty of Vais\xc2\x92vadeva. On the right side of the Devi\nerect an altar (sthan _d_ ila) six feet square and instal Ag _n_ i (Fire)\nthere. Invoke there the Deity, thinking of Her Form and worship Her with\nscents and flowers. Then with the Vyarhiti Mantra with Svaha prefixed and Mula\n(Deya) Mantra perform the Homa ceremony with oblations, charu and ghee, twenty\nfive times. Next perform Homa again with Vyarhiti. Next worship the Devi with\nscents, etc., and consider the Devi and Pitha Devata as one and the same. Then\ntake leave of (visarjana) the Ag _n_ i (Fire). Offer valis (sacrifices) all\nround to the Pars\xc2\x92vadas of the Devi with the remnant charu of the Homa.\n\n\n\nNow again worship the Devi with five offerings and offer betel, umbrella,\nchamara and others and repeat the Mula mantra thousand times. After finishing\nthe Japam, place Karkari (a water-jar with small holes at the bottom, as in a\nsieve) on the rice in the north-eastern corner and invoke the Devi there and\nworship Her. Uttering the mantra \xc2\x93Rak _s_ a Rak _s_ a\xc2\x94 moisten the place with\nwater coming out of Karkari, and repeat the Pha _t_ mantra. After re-\nworshipping the Devi, place Karkari in due position. Thus the Guru finishes\nthe Adhivasa (foregoing) ceremony and takes his meals with the disciple and\nsleeps that night on that altar.\n\n\n\n82-106. O Narada! Now I am describing briefly about the Homa Ku _nd_ a (a\nround hole in the ground consecrated to the Deity) and the Samskara ceremony\nof the Sthan _d_ ila (the sacrificial altar). Uttering, first, the Mula\nMantra, see, fix your gaze on the Ku _nd_ a; then sprinkle it with water and\nthe Pha _t_ mantra and drive away the evil-spirits from there. Then with\nmantra \xc2\x93Hum\xc2\x94 again sprinkle it with water.\n\n\n\np. 1159\n\n\n\nThen draw within it three lines Pragagra and Udagagra (on the eastern and\nnorthern sides). Sprinkling it with water and the Pra _n_ ava, worship within\nthe Pi _t_ ha, uttering the mantras from \xc3\x82dhara S\xc2\x92aktaye nama _h_ to Amuka\nDevi Yoga Pi _t_ haya nama _h_. Invoke, in that Pitha, the Highest One, Who is\nS\xc2\x92iva S\xc2\x92iva with all one-ness of heart and worship Her with scents and\nofferings. Then think for a moment the Devi as having taken bath and as one\nwith S\xc2\x92ankara. Bring then fire in a vessel and taking a flaming piece thereof\nthrow that in the south-west corner. Then purifying it by the gaze and\nquitting the portions of Kravyada _h_ , impart the Chaitanya by \xc2\x93Ra _m_ ,\xc2\x94 the\nVah _n_ ivija repeat \xc2\x93O _m_ \xc2\x94 over it seven times. Shew, then, the Dhenumudra\nand protect it by Pha _t_ Kara and cover, veil, it with the mantra \xc2\x93Hum.\xc2\x94 Then\nturn the fire, thus worshipped with sandalpaste, etc., thrice over the Ku _nd_\na and with both the knees on the ground and repeating the Pra _n_ ava,\nconsider the Ag _n_ i as the Virya of S\xc2\x92iva and throw it on the yoni of the\nDevi in the Pitha. Then offer \xc3\x82chamana, etc., to the Deva and the Devi and\nworship. Then light the flame with the mantra \xc2\x93Chit Pingala Hana Hana Daha\nDaha Pacha Pacha Sarvaj\xc3\xb1a J\xc3\xb1apaya Svaha.\xc2\x94 Then utter the stotra to the Ag _n_\ni Deva with great love, repeating the mantra \xc2\x93Agnim Prajvalitam vande\nJatavedam Hutas\xc2\x92ana _m_ suvar _n_ a var _n_ amamalam samiddham Visvatomukha\n_m_.\xc2\x94 Then perform the _S_ a _d_ a _m_ ganyasa to the Ag _n_ i Deva \xc2\x93Om\nSahasrarchchi _s_ e nama _h_ , Om Svasti Pur _n_ aya Svaha,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93Om Utti _st_ ha\npuru _s_ aya va _s_ at,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93Om Dhuma vyapine Hu _m_ Om Sapta Jihvaya vau _s_ at\xc2\x94\n\xc2\x93Om Dhanur dharaya Pha _t_.\xc2\x94 Repeating the above six mantras, perform the\nNyasa on the heart, etc., the six places. Now meditate on the Ag _n_ i as of a\ngolden colour, three-eyed, seated on a lotus and holding in His four hands\nsigns of granting boons, S\xc2\x92akti, Svastika and sign of \xc2\x93no fear,\xc2\x94 also meditate\non Ag _n_ i, as the seat of the greatest auspiciousness. Then moisten the Ku\n_nd_ a on the top of the belt (mekhala) with water. Next spread the Kus\xc2\x92a\ngrass all around and draw the Ag _n_ i yantra over it, i.e., triangle,\nhectagon, circle, eight-petalled figure and Bhupura; rather have this drawing\nbefore the Ag _n_ isthapana. Now meditate this only. Then, within the Yantra,\nrecite \xc2\x93Vais\xc2\x92vanara Jataveda Lohitak _s_ a sarvakarma _n_ i Sadhaya Svaha\xc2\x94 and\nworship Ag _n_ i. Then worship in the centre and in the hectagon at the\ncorners worship the Saptajihva (seven tongues Hira _n_ ya, Gagana, Rakta, Kri\n_sn_ a, Suprabha, Bahurupa, Atiraktika) and next worship within the pericarp\nof the lotus the Anga Devatas. Then recite the following mantras within the\neight petals :-- \xc2\x93O _m_ Agnaye Jatavedase nama _h_ ,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93 O _m_ Agnaye\nSaptajihvaya namah,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93 O _m_ Agnaye Havyavahanaya\n\n\n\np. 1160\n\n\n\nnama _h_ ,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93O _m_ Agnaye As\xc2\x92vodarajaya nama _h_ ,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93O _m_ Agnaye\nVais\xc2\x92vanaraya nama _h_ ,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93O _m_ Agnaye Kaumara tejase nama _h_ ,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93O _m_\nAgnaye Vis\xc2\x92vamukhaya nama _h_ ,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93O _m_ Agnaye Devamukhaya nama _h_ \xc2\x94 and\nconsidering the forms to hold S\xc2\x92akti and Svastik, worship them. Then consider\nIndra and the other Lokapalas (Regents of the several quarters) situated in\nthe east, south-east, and so on together with their weapons, the thunderbolt\nand the other weapons, and thus worship them.\n\n\n\n107-134. O Narada! Next purify the sacrificial ladles, etc., sruk, sruva,\netc., and ghee; then, taking ghee by sruva, go on with the Homa ceremony.\nDivide the ghee of the \xc3\x82jyasthali (the vessel in which the ghee for the Homa\npurposes is kept) in three parts; take ghee from the right side and saying \xc2\x93O\n_m_ Agnaye Svaha\xc2\x94 offer oblations on the right eye of the Ag _n_ i; take ghee\nfrom the left side and saying \xc2\x93Om Somaye Svaha\xc2\x94 offer oblations on the left\neye of the Ag _n_ i; take ghee from the centre and saying, \xc2\x93O _m_ Agni _s_\nomabhya _m_ Svaha,\xc2\x94 offer oblations on the central eye of the Agni. Take ghee\nagain from the right side and saying \xc2\x93O _m_ Agnaye Svi _st_ ak _r_ ite Svaha\xc2\x94\noffer oblations to the mouth of the Ag _n_ i. Then the devotee is to repeat \xc2\x93O\n_m_ Bhu _h_ Svaha,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93O _m_ Bhuva _h_ Svaha,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93O _m_ Sva _h_ Svaha\xc2\x94 and offer\nthrice the oblations; next he is to offer oblations thrice with the Ag _n_ i\nmantra. After this, O Muni! for impregnation and each of the ten Samskaras,\nnatal-ceremony, tonsure, etc., he is to repeat the Pra _n_ ava Mantra and\noffer the eight oblations of ghee on each occasion. Now hear of the tenfold Sa\n_m_ skaras :-- (1) Impregnation, (2) Pu _m_ savan (a ceremony performed as\nsoon as a woman perceives the foetus to be quick), (3) Simantonnayana (a\nceremony observed by women in the fourth, sixth or the eighth month of\npregnancy), (4) Jata Karma (ceremony at the birth of a child), (5) Namakara\n_n_ a, (naming the child), (6) Ni _s_ krama _n_ a (a ceremony performed when a\nnew-born child is first taken out of the house into the open air usually in\nthe fourth month), (7) Annapras\xc2\x92ana (when the rice is put in the mouth of the\nchild), (8) Chu _d_ akara _n_ a (the ceremony of the first tonsure), (9)\nUpanayana (holding the sacrificial thread; (10) Godana and Udvaha (gift of\ncows and marriage). These are stated in the Vedas. Next worship S\xc2\x92iva Parvati,\nthe Father and the Mother of Ag _n_ i and take leave of them. Next in the name\nof Ag _n_ i, offer five Samidhas (fuel) soaked in ghee and offer one oblation\nof ghee to each of the \xc3\x82vara _n_ a Devatas.\n\n\n\nThen take the ghee by the S\xc2\x92ruk and covering it with the S\xc2\x92ruva, offer ten\noblations to Ag _n_ i, and Maha Ganes\xc2\x92a with mantras ending in Vau _s_ a _t_ ,\n\n\n\np. 1161\n\n\n\nThe Maha Ganes\xc2\x92a mantras run as follows :-- (1) O _m_ , O _m_ Svaha (2) O _m_\nS\xc2\x92rim Svaha, (3) O _m_ S\xc2\x92rim Hrim Svaha, (4) O _m_ S\xc2\x92rim Hrim Klim Svaha, (5)\nO _m_ S\xc2\x92rim Hrim Klim Glau _m_ Svaha, (6) O _m_ S\xc2\x92rim Hrim Klim Glau _m_ Ga\n_m_ Svaha, (7) O _m_ S\xc2\x92rim Hrim Klim Glau _m_ ityanta _h_ Ga _m_ Ga _n_\napataye Svaha, (8) O _m_ Vara Varada ityanta _h_ Svaha, (9) Sarvajana _m_ me\nVas\xc2\x92a _m_ ityanto Svaha and (10) \xc3\x82naya Svaha ityanta _h_.\n\n\n\nNext perform in the Ag _n_ i the Pi _t_ ha Puja and meditate on the Deya \xc3\x8e\n_st_ adeva and worship him. Next offer twenty-five oblations to his face,\nrepeating the Mula Mantra. Then think of that and Ag _n_ i Deva as one and the\nsame, and then again as one with \xc3\x82tman. Then offer oblations to each of the\n_S_ a _d_ a _m_ ga Devatas separately. Then search for the Nadis (veins) of\nVah _n_ i and \xc3\x8e _st_ a Devata and offer twenty one oblations. Then offer\noblations to each of the two Devatas separately. Next offer one thousand and\neight oblations to the \xc3\x8e _st_ a Deva with Til soaked in ghee or with the\nmaterials enumerated in the Kalpa. O Muni! Thus finishing the Homa ceremony,\nconsider that the \xc3\x8e _st_ a Deva (the Devi), Ag _n_ i and the \xc3\x82vara _n_ a\nDeities are all satisfied. Then, by the command of the Guru, the disciple is\nto take his bath and perform his Sandhya, etc., and put on new clothes (cloth\nand chadar) and golden ornaments. He is to come then, to the Ku _nd_ a with\nKama _nd_ alu in his hand and with a pure heart. He is to bow down to the\nelders and superiors seated in the assembly and take his seat in his \xc3\x82sana.\nS\xc2\x92ri Guru Deva then would look at the disciple with kind eyes and think the\nChaitanya of the disciple within his own (the Guru\xc2\x92s) body. Then the Guru Deva\nwould perform the Homa and look at the disciple with a divine gaze, so that\nthe disciple becomes pure-hearted and able to get the favours of the Devas.\nThus the Guru must purify all the Adhvas (the passages) of the body of the\ndisciple.\n\n\n\nThen the Guru is to touch respectively the feet, generative organ, navel,\nheart, forehead, and the head of the disciple with Kurcha (a bundle of Kus\xc2\x92a\ngrass) and til soaked in ghee, in his left hand and offer at each touch eight\noblations, repeating the mantra \xc2\x93O _m_ adya S\xc2\x92i _s_ yasya Kaladhvanam\nS\xc2\x92odhayami Svaha, etc.\xc2\x94 Thus the Guru would purify Kaladhva (in the feet)\nTattvadhva (in the generative organ), Bhuvanadhva (in the navel), Var _n_\nadhva (in the heart), Padadhva (in the fore-head) and Mantradhva (on the\nhead), the six Adhvas and think these all to be dissolved in Brahma\n(Brahmalina).\n\n\n\n135-155. Then, again, the Guru would think all these to be re-born from Brahma\nand transfer the Chaitanya of the disciple that was in him to the disciple.\nThen the Guru must offer Pur _n_ ahuti and consider\n\n\n\np. 1162\n\n\n\nthe \xc3\x8e _st_ a Devata, placed in the fire by the visarjana mantra for the Homa\npurposes, as entered into the water-jar. He is to perform again the Vyarhiti\nHoma and offer all the A _m_ gahutis (oblations to all the limbs) of the fire\nand take leave of the fire withdrawing the Deity from the jar, into his own\nbody. Uttering then the Vau _s_ a _t_ Mantra he would tie the eyes of the\ndisciple with a piece of cloth and would bring him from the Ku _nd_ a to the\nma _nd_ ala and make the disciple offer pu _s_ pa _n_ jali (flowers in his\npalm) to the \xc3\x8e _st_ a deva. Then he would take away the bandage or piece of\ncloth from his eyes and ask him to take his seat in the seat Kusasana. Thus\nthe Guru, after having purified the elements of the body of the disciple and\nperformed the Nyasa of the Deya Mantra, would make the disciple sit in another\nma _nd_ ala. Then he would touch the head of the disciple with the twigs\n(Pallavas) of the Ku _nd_ a and repeat the Matrika Mantra and make him have\nhis bath with the water of the jar which is considered as the seat of the \xc3\x8e\n_st_ a Deva. Then, for the protection of the disciple, he would sprinkle (abhi\n_s_ eka) him with the water of the Vardhani vessel placed already in the\nnorth-east corner. Then the disciple would get up and put on the pair of new\nclothes and besmear his whole body with ashes and sit close by the Guru. When\nthe merciful Guru would consider that the S\xc2\x92iva S\xc2\x92akti has now passed out of\nhis own body and that Divine Force, the Devi, has entered into the body of the\ndisciple, i.e., charged the disciple with the pass. Thinking now the disciple\nand the Devata to be one and the same, the Guru would now worship the disciple\nwith flowers and scents. The Guru would then place his right hand on the head\nof the disciple and repeat clearly in his right ear the Maha Mantra of the\nMaha Devi . The disciple is to repeat also the Maha Mantra one hundred and\neight times and fall prostrate on the ground before the Guru and thus bow down\nto the Guru, whom the disciple now thinks as the incarnate of the Deva.\n\n\n\nThe disciple, the devotee of the Guru, would now give as a Dak _s_ i _n_ a all\nhis wealth and property for his whole life to the Guru. Then he would give Dak\n_s_ i _n_ a to the priests and make charities to the virgins; the Brahma _n_\nas, the poor and the destitute and the orphans. Here he is not to be miserly\nin any way in the expenditure. O Narada! Thus the disciple would consider\nhimself blessed and he would daily remain engaged in repeating the Maha\nMantra. Thus I have described to you above\n\nThe most excellent Dik _s_ a. Thinking all these, you are to remain ever\nengaged in worshipping the lotus feet of the Great Devi. There is no Dharma\nhigher than this in this world for the Brahma _n_ as. The followers of the\nVedas would impart this Mantra according to the rules stated respectively in\ntheir own Grihya Sutras; and the Tantrikas\n\n\n\np. 1163\n\n\n\nwould also do the same according to their own Tantras. The Vaidiks should not\nfollow the Tantra rules and the Tantriks are not to follow the Vaidik rules.\nThus all the S\xc2\x92astras say. And this is the Sanatan Creed. Naraya _n_ a said\n:-- O Narada! I have described all about the ordinary Dik _s_ a that you\nquestioned me. Now the essence in brief is this that you would remain always\nmerged in worshipping the Para S\xc2\x92akti, the Highest Force, the Maha Devi. What\nmore shall I say than this that I have got the highest pleasure and the\nNirvana, the peace, that passeth all understanding, from my daily worshipping\nThat Lotus Feet duly. Vedavyasa said :-- O Maharaja! O Janamejayan! After\nhaving said this Dik _s_ atattva, the highest Yogi Bhagavan Naraya _n_ a,\nmeditated by the Yogis, closed his eyes and remained merged in Samadhi, in the\nmeditation of the Lotus Feet of the Devi.\n\n\n\nKnowing this Highest Tattva, Narada, the chief of the Ri _s_ is, bowed down at\nthe feet of the Great Guru Naraya _n_ a and went away immediately to perform\nthe tapasya so that he also might see the Maha Devi.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Seventh Chapter of the Twelfth Book on the Dik _s_ a vidhi or on\nthe rules of Initiation in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of\n18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 8](bk12ch08.htm)\n\n'
