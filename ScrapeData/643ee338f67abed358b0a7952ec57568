He\nwho knows the Brahman as existing, him we know himself as existing.' The\nembodied Self of this (bliss) is the same as that of the former\n(understanding).\n\nThereupon follow the questions of the pupil:\n\n'Does any one who knows not, after he has departed this life, ever go to that\nworld? Or does he who knows, after he has departed, go to that world 1?'\n\np. 58\n\nThe answer is: He wished, may I be many [1](sbe15040.htm#fn_219), may I grow\nforth. He brooded over himself (like a man performing penance). After he had\nthus brooded, he sent forth (created) all, whatever there is. Having sent\nforth, he entered into it. Having entered it, he became sat (what is manifest)\nand tyat (what is not manifest), defined and undefined, supported and not\nsupported, (endowed with) knowledge and without knowledge (as stones), real\nand unreal [2](sbe15040.htm#fn_220). The Sattya (true) became all this\nwhatsoever, and therefore the wise call it (the Brahman) Sat-tya (the true).\n\nOn this there is also this _S_ loka:\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[57:1](sbe15039.htm#fr_218) As he who knows and he who knows not, are both\nsprung from Brahman, the question is supposed to be asked by the pupil,\nwhether both will equally attain Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 7](sbe15040.htm)\n\n"
