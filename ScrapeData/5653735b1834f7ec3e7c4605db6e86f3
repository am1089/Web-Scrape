How animals eat\nvegetables of many different tastes. Then all animals soon eat themselves, O\nVema! (Note the verbs are masculine),\n\n901\n\nIf we go on worshipping (shactis)the demigods, what is the use of men any more\nin the earth. Think not it is a sin but seize and punish them all who in the\nworld are men of virtue.\n\n902\n\np. 218\n\nWhy should they who worship the (jeeva linga) living principle still think of\nstone figures? When ye have tasted delicious sugar will ye again taste what is\nbitter?\n\n903\n\nWhat is the use of wearing an empty lingam and painting your body with ashes;\nIf you consider it closely--if you wash yourself and wear a lingam, will it\nfill your belly in any way?\n\n904\n\nAfter bathing, fasting, preparing food and desiring the god to eat it, they\nsmite him on the [face](errata.htm#164) and devour it themselves. (satire)\n\n905\n\nMen imagine stones to be Siva, and magnify them. Stones are stones and not\nSiva. Why is it that we cannot discern Siva who dwells within us?\n\n906\n\nWhen a man comes up as evidence the court will be displeased with him, so if\nthou avoid all inconsistency, if thou neither diminish nor add to it. All\nother evidence is no evidence.\n\np. 219\n\n907\n\nLike as a pearl is produced united with _tunga_ grass, like to a wishing tree\ngrowing before thy house, like as though the cow (camadhenu--the celestial\ncow) were born in thy presence, thus fortunate was the birth of Vemana in the\nworld!\n\n908\n\nHe who knowing the Everlasting considers Vemadu as Siva in his mind and\ncautiously guardeth his heart; this is the man of unfluctuating mind.\n\n909\n\nAre not all they who read the whole _shastras_ on a level with those who do\nnot read them, if from the mouth of the teacher they learn not true\napplication (enjoyment)? Hear this word openly declared to the world!\n\n910\n\nHe who can gainsay the writing of [Brahma](errata.htm#165), he who can destroy\nthe institutes of the Prime Vishnu, he who can stand in opposition to Him who\nhas three eyes such shall never appear among men, save (excepting) thyself O!\nVema!\n\np. 220\n\n911\n\nFate continually awaiteth all men however great; is it a marvel when\ndebasement comes? Did not Vishnu who bore the mountain Govardhan on his\nfinger, afterwards float in peril on a banyan leaf?\n\n912\n\nSiva, the chief of Gods, though he burnt up cupid with the flame of his\nforehead eye cannot leave his wife; who then are the chiefs of sages who can\ndesert woman?\n\n913\n\nAh! did you never hear that golden animals (deer) are produced in the world?\nIs king Rama [devoid](errata.htm#166) of sense? Your schemes avail\n[nothing](errata.htm#167) for fate rules all.\n\n914\n\nWhen Dasaratha thought to crown his son Rama king of earth being deluded he\nbound his head with merely matted hair. Thus intentions avail nothing, For\nfate rules all.\n\n915\n\np. 221\n\nDid the amorous Hara (Siva) fail of becoming mighty? Did not the amorous\nVishnu become mighty? If Ganesa who hated love become great?\n\n916\n\nWith the army of monkeys that wandered the hills without food, Rama king of\nearth formed an army and conquered. But one Vibhishana ruled Lanka by the\nfavour of Lakshmi.\n\n917\n\nWhen Siva struck off and threw away [Brahma's](errata.htm#168) head, did any\nof the other deities oppose him? Who can perfect the sinner who hath not the\nfavour of Siva?\n\n918\n\nThough his dwelling be on Meru, the golden hill cupidity will not leave the\nGod Indra himself. Did not he ask Karna for his armour and large earrings?\n\n919\n\nHe, Vishnu, that lay down in the sea of milk, why should he have wished for\nthe milk of the shepherd's village? How sweet is the property of our\nneighbour?\n\n920\n\np. 222\n\nDid not Indra, through cupidity become degraded? Was not cupid, through\n[desire](errata.htm#169), turned into earth? When Brahma contracted desire did\nnot he lose his principal head.\n\n921\n\nCubera (Dhanapathi i.e. Plutus) being his friend, and united to him (the\npoints of heaven they rule, touch and they are friends) how did Siva become a\nmendicant? However numerous your rich friends be, no wealth but your own can\naid you.\n\n922\n\nIn dress you may become a _Dasari_ , when the due season is lost, you may\nbecome a _Jangam_ , ascetic. But though then thousand things happen to you,\nyou cannot become a Brahmin.\n\n923\n\nBy the various names of generative eggs, having grown like hills, recklessly\n(dancingly, lit) they insult God When their turn arrives they fall in the\nhands [of](errata.htm#170) Yama's messenger.\n\n924\n\nRama did not consider whether there were golden deers in the world or not?\nWhat is Rama so insance a prine? _(sic.)_ If you leave your town and roam in\nthe forests your senses will not remain.\n\np. 222\n\n925\n\nOne Siva carried a woman Parvathi on his side; one Brahma held a woman,\nSaraswathi in his mouth. One Vishnu bore a woman, Lakshmi, on his breast; for\nwoman they thus suffer great trouble.\n\n926\n\nThough he hath the hills of silver and gold, Kailasa and Meru, why doth the\ngod Siva wander and collect alms. His neighbour's property is sweet to every\nman however great.\n\n927\n\nKing Sibi cut a piece out of his body to give for a dove to a hawk. He became\nthe topic of report and attained fame. They will not esteem him who is wicked,\nbut will praise him who is charitable.\n\n928\n\n[Vishnu](errata.htm#171) left the circle of skin, and would not come to the\nshore being entangled in the [wiles](errata.htm#172) of Lakshmi, daughter of\nthe sea. Vishnu (Shargnee the Bowyer) being so mighty, what can men do?\n\n929\n\np. 224\n\nHe that is as great as Sukrachari, knowing all things with his sharp sight if\ninstead of [restraining](errata.htm#173) his mind let it roam, is like the\nblind crow. (The crow and Sukrachari each have but one eye )\n\n930\n\nWhat king is mightier than (Duryodhana) Dhartarashtra? He and all the rest are\ndead, All the wicked shall surely suffer a violent death.\n\n931\n\nKing Dasaratha when on earth, thinking it was an elephant (this is a story in\nRaghuvamsa) slew the son of the guru in the earth (or cast him down to the\nground); through grief for his son was not his life also ended? (lit. his\ngoing was extinguished.)\n\n932\n\nPandu, king of earth, slew the couple of animals (deer) through ignorance.\nThereby how long did he live in the world, and what did he (eat) enjoy?\n\n933\n\nNo man's acts can be transferred to another. God took the just king to an\nunsuitable place and changed, him into Kanku Bhatlu, alas, alas!\n\np. 225\n\n934\n\nKaika (Kaikeyi) one wife of Dasaratha and mother of Bharata was born to cause\nthe ruin of Rama's City. Seeta was born to destroy the state of Lanka and they\nsay Chitrangi was born to destroy the king.\n\n935\n\nSurely the evil of poverty is an interminable degradation. Thereby king Nala\nleft his palace. For a mere joy will they suffer such distress.\n\n936\n\nWhen we are born, before they seize and cut the navel; when we were born, god,\nthe teacher was born in this world. Examine well and know this.\n\n937\n\nThough you be a hero, or have learned wisdom, or learnt reading, or be at\ncourt, beatitude will not reach you. It is the fruit of birth and you cannot\nattain it even by austerities.\n\n938\n\np. 226\n\nIn the belly of Vishnu the world shineth (see Bhagavat-geeta). In it existeth\nall the universe. All the millions of animated are hence evidently\nVaishnavites.\n\n939\n\nStill do they speak calling the world, illusion. It is no illusion. It is\nformed of the divinity. If this be delusion, tell me where the actual divinity\nis to be found.\n\n940\n\nBehold! Brahmins, Kshatrias, Vysyas, Soodras, even Brahma, Vishnu and Siva--\nthese are beasts. In ignorance of the divinity have all these forms\noriginated.\n\n941\n\nProduced before the water and germinating in water, that germ fills the world.\nLearn that this water is the world (mystic).\n\n942\n\nHast thou not heard that Vishnu and the other god (Brahma) are dead? Hast not\nthou heard that Siva sports alone in varying forms through all religions. Hast\nthou not heard of those studies that have an aim. Reflect and know the season\nwhen thy day shall come, select the noblest and most stable pursuit.\n\np. 227\n\n943\n\nYe who will not consent to give your women in marriage to all the (total) men\nof all castes, ye yet agree to take their daughters in marriage. O ye vile\nBrahmins!\n\n944\n\nHis mother is Gowri (Parvati). His father is Shambhu (Siva). The troops of\nlower deities are all his relations. The house of his birth is the glorious\nCailasa.\n\n945\n\nUsing the terms mother and father they know not the truth being produced from\nthe Yoni and Lingam. But know thou that the mother is Vishnu and the glorious\nSiva thy father.\n\n946\n\nThose men of wisdom, who begin by subduing their mind and thus live shall at\nlast see the abode of bliss. If thou plant a tree shall not thou surely obtain\nits fruit.\n\n947\n\nIf thou know the real nature of noble Shaiva calling (profession), walk in the\nknowledge of God. Though shall be as though born as of a tiger and lion.\n\np. 228\n\n948\n\nThey who revile Siva all wear the attire of Vyasa and Dakhsa Prajapati and the\nrest are shameless like a man who knowing the evils of fornication and yet\ncommitting it.\n\n949\n\nThe Shaiva creed is the most acceptable speaker of all the six creeds. Men\ncannot comprehend that God is one. The discrimination of persons exists in our\nfancies not in the deity.\n\n950\n\nUnless our desires be quenched, our body being set on fire will be vexed. Let\nus not be tossed about in this house of the body, but know that Siva exists in\nthe body.\n\n951\n\nSiva is the radical root in the world. (if thou consider it) What they call\nVishnu shines as being Siva. Siva is Vishnu. O ye who wear the semblance of\nSiva and Vishnu.\n\n952\n\np. 229\n\nIn this vile (Kaliyuga) Iron age while all petty rogues (thieving plow boys)\nmake a sport of all faith in Siva, shall this hypocritical profession attain\nsalvation?\n\n953\n\nThose scholars in the Veda who are versed in the _Veda-shastra_ , and the\nsciences, search and seek for thee, but cannot perceive thee in the earth.\nFinally they fall dead, O Vema!\n\n954\n\nWhen Brahma with all his reading was destroyed and when the original Vishnu\nwas (ended) slain, then Vemana exposed their emptiness. (let sought their\ndisgrace.)\n\n955\n\nVemana has surpassed the Vedas. Vema is the Vedanta. The Vedas are all\ndifferent. Meddle not with the contentions about such matters.\n\n956\n\nHave ye not heard of that men of trifling minds (entangled) confused by the\nintricate Five letters (Namassivaya) and five Vedas (4 Vedas and fifthly the\npuranas). In the five sects, if thou consider it, Siva dwells.\n\np. 230\n\n957\n\nIf poor in wealth a man retains not resolution. By poverty king Nala lost his\nhome, gave his garment to a bird and was ruined.\n\n958\n\nThe God-like force (or the force of the Veda) that Dasasyu (Ravanasura) being\nmighty gained, being mightier than any whom even the Gods had beheld, perished\nby the means of mere monkeys and all his tribe sunk with him.\n\n959\n\nThrough the words of his wife Kaika the king (Dasaradha) perished. For the\nsake of a woman (Seeta) the name of _Dasasya_ (Ravanasura) was humbled. Surely\nevery mean act, who ever he be, shall follow him.\n\n960\n\nThat one like Brahma should have been destroyed. That one like cupid should\nhave turned into flame. Then shall ye who are with a sure life live as though\neternity were yours?\n\n961\n\np. 231\n\nThe original Purana is such as slays the Rakshrsas. The Bharata and others are\nof kin (i.e. benevolent as relations.) The Gurupurana is the destroyer of\nimposture.\n\n962\n\nAmong the Gods Brahma, Siva, Vishnu and the rest and among the demi-Gods that\nroam the three worlds and among the excellent men and with in thyself O Vema\nhe who acts up rightly is the eternal.\n\n[963](errata.htm#174)\n\nThe Lingam is the highest Siva. The (Zangam) worshipper, is the animated\nbeast. If that animated being be pure, he shall attain Siva, Unless thou know\nthe unknown, how shalt thou attain the divinity.\n\n964\n\nThen thou hast with (sport) joy perceived the lingam in thy body, thy mind\nshall be enamoured of that lingam. If thou fix (or restrain) thy mind, in it.\nshall the lingam dwell.\n\n965\n\nThrough ignorance of the secret of our patron (or loved) Linga, the eager fool\nwanders to the Hill of Shrishylam. At last he fails of bliss and becometh a\nfool.\n\np. 232\n\n966\n\nBorn in a human race, and growing up there from the day he was born in it the\nman devoted to Siva becometh noble. (lit. rich)\n\n967\n\nHe that is born in a human race and who grows up there in becometh a man; hear\nthis--who is the noblest in the race of men? He who walks in the sect of Siva,\nthis is the chief of the noble.\n\n968\n\nThe Smrities all declare Siva to be the chief Brahma. How is it then that\nBrahmana pays adoration to any other. Should not we call those who believe in\nSiva, Bramins?\n\n969\n\nWere fire a [deity](errata.htm#175), by worshipping it should not we attain\nthe dwelling of salvation? Did not the fire turn pale before Veerabhadra.\n\n970\n\np. 233\n\nWere not the men destroyed (turned into water) who held fire in their hands\nand reviled Siva, Do not ye know the troubles that happened at the sacrifice\nmade by Dakshudu?\n\n971\n\nHe wears the lingam merely to [attain](errata.htm#176) money, thereby, vile\nand worthless son of a brute. Being for the sake of money they fall into the\ndoctrine of works.\n\n972\n\nThe firmament is in our eight sides. The heaven is widely extended in every\npart on our eight quarters. In the midst of that ineffable firmament the\ndivinity is mightily infused.\n\n973\n\nVishnu and Siva dwelling perpetually in the soul of a foolish mind is he who\nseeks for a distinct deity. Like a [shepherd](errata.htm#177) who seeks the\nsheep that is under his armpit.\n\n974\n\nWhat is the use of a linga that is tied and dangles at your neck and is not\nlet go. Heaven is the witness to the entire world.\n\np. 234\n\n975\n\nWhat is called Veda is in fact mere dispute. Vishnu and Siva are both combined\nin the Veda. That existeth every where. There is neither difference nor\ndistinction; praise him.\n\n976\n\nFalse is their creed who declare (in the world) that it is greatly profitable\nto give up the enjoyment of this life. Can ye not see that the next world\nshines forth in the present life.\n\n977\n\nThat saint who hath learnt to know the difference between sunshine and shade\ncannot live in this world which he [despises](errata.htm#178) from knowing a\nbetter, but the glutton saint who worships the belly ever roameth the earth.\n\n978\n\nTruly they call a goldsmith a thief. He is thief who calls him thief. Did not\n_Vishvakarma_ convert earth into gold and share it out?\n\n979\n\np. 235\n\nThe Linga creed is the noblest of the six creeds. There is none superior in\nthe world and there is no thief greater than the linga worshipper. (weaver)\n\n980\n\nSandhya performed out of season is mere idling. What is time? What is the\n[preceding](errata.htm#179) time? If thou rule not time, and past time how is\nthis Sandhya?\n\n981\n\nIf thou see him (the supreme being) who slew Brahma the lotus born who plunged\nVishnu into the (ambudhi) sea, who sent Siva to remain fixed on the hill of\nCailasa, if thou see him being thyself transformed into Siva, thou shalt\nattain the highest of joy.\n\n982\n\nWhether you name it Siva, Indivisible the chief spirit, the Lingam or living\nlingam, the terms indeed vary, but the divinity is all one.\n\n983\n\nThe curse of Goutama is terrible as the wrath of Siva, the poison throated. It\nmade Indra king of Gods, as a debased. The reproach of Goutama the _muni_ ,\nwas an [infallible](errata.htm#180) magic arrow. (Sanscrit)\n\np. 236\n\n984\n\nIf a misfortune befalls Siva the forehead eyed, let even the wisest condole\nwith him and remove it (teercu). If, knowing it to be a scorpion you seize it\nwill it own your kindness and not sting you? (That is, meddle not to comfort a\npassionate violent person.)\n\n985\n\nThere is one creation possessing redness, whiteness and blackness; great in\nmight unknown to anyone possessing power. He that has acquired power to view\nthis divinity is himself a part of it.\n\n986\n\nBrahma is merciless. Mighty as they were, Parashara (father of Vyasa) and the\nrest were burnt up. What then are the senseless wretches void of wisdom (\n_Vivara_ ).\n\n987\n\nThere was once a merchant who for a wonder in this earth knowing the deity\nperformed every virtue, and became celebrated. But failing of reverencing Yama\nhe drew near to Siva.\n\np. 237\n\n988\n\nBoth the evil and the good done by us in a former birth regularly become our\nportion in this life. How should either good or evil that we have not done in\nthe first birth betide us?\n\n989\n\nWhy did Sesha, king of serpents gnash his teeth with rage. Why did Surya\nthrough anger become cruel? By anger Vulkan became diminished in day light.\nAnger is unprofitable to any man.\n\n990\n\nHim that we call the Teacher is unknown to these men; in a thousand ways is\nBrahma the ruler. He is Lord of Earth and Teacher of all. Thus esteemed, who\nis his equal, where shall we see him?\n\n991\n\nIf thou view and look close thou shalt know that after thou hast put on a\nmortal body and provided the seven sons (i.e., the seven chief good deeds) and\nafforded protections to thy kith and kin, thou shalt derive no advantage from\nthem.\n\np. 238\n\n992\n\nIs a man now able himself to alter that writing of fate that Brahma originally\nwrote on his forehead; who on earth is now able to know the cupidity of the\navaricious soul?\n\n993\n\nBrahma is the writer of destiny, Vishnu is the Minister (counsellor). Siva is\nthe original agent. View this distinctly. If thou understand the conduct of\nthese three and likewise their original (i.e., the supreme spirit) then shalt\nthou become a worshipper of the chief of beings.\n\n994\n\nAmong those three Hara, Hari and Aja (Brahma) which is scaler (lit., seat),\nThat is creator which is the chief (Vishnu who as Krishna turned thief) which\nis the original? Who can name each of these appropriately and without\nconfusion?\n\n995\n\np. 239\n\nBehold there are three (Trimoorties) Images. There are also three fools\n(Ravanasura in the Ramayana, Duryodhana in the Bharata, Kansa in Bhagavata),\nThose who have excelled their equals are three (Rama over Ravanasura, Bheemudu\nover Duryodhana, Krishna over Kansa). Of these which is most glorious, which\nthe inglorious, estimate their worth and explain it, O Vema!\n\n996\n\nLooking upon all creatures as equal knowing the course of that pair, birth and\ndeath; finally thus shall not. He punishes several. Then is there a more\nrighteous judge than Yama?\n\n997\n\nAll men consider Yama as a great sinner, and reproach him well and greatly,\nWhat does Yama commit even the smallest evil?\n\n998\n\nHowever often we talk of that day or once upon a time (i.e., a former birth)\nit is no nearer to the present. Talking of the present does not make it the\npast. Then know the difference of these, do not become a jest. But know that\nthe three a. e one. This shall gain the heaven. (Possibly the three are the\nTrimoorties).\n\np. 240\n\n999\n\nThese aching (teasing) bones are the rafters. The entwined nerves are the\nlaths. The strong skin may be considered the covering ail. The doors are the\nnine apertures. With pride the five (senses or pranas) if we go to look at\nthem [have](errata.htm#181) exceeded through cause of hungers and thirst. In\nthe body, like to a vest, the strong family of consanguinity dwells. His acts\nare the covering cast over all. In this house imbued with the nature of dung\nand urine and in such a dwelling how shall we dwell? The firm sage alone knows\nthat which is fixed and permanent.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 1000-1099](vov12.htm)\n\n"
