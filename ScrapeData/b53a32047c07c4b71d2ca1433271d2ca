Archaic sentences here and there in the\nworld\'s scriptures tell us of the wars that were waged in Heaven before the\nbeginning of time, and of the heritage--dim, prehistoric, supernatural in the\nnatural--that was left from them to men and gods.\n\nWhat is it that makes this element of mythology so clear, what force has\nraised it in this one case to the significance which it attains in the\n_Chandi_ portion of the _Markandeya Purana?_ This is, above all others, the\n_Purana_ of Bengal. But here the central figure of the drama is no archangel,\nmighty in power and beauty, but the Mother herself, personification of the\ncreative energy, focus and centre of the visible Universe. Back and forth\namidst the applause of Heaven does She pursue the ever-changing demons, and at\nthe moment of her triumph, when, ten-armed, pedestaled on the\n\np. 58\n\nliving lion and sword in hand, She subjugates her foe for ever, She is\nportrayed as the image of Durga. Such is the story told by the scripture--\nhalf-epic, half-liturgy--from which are taken the texts that are recited over\nand over again from one end of Bengal to the other, with worship and fasting,\nthroughout the great nine days, from the new moon of _Aswin_ , until _Dussera_\nor tenth day. Here and there are those--monks in their monasteries, perhaps,\nor Brahmins in their homes--who recite the whole of the _Chandi_ again and\nagain. But for all alike, whether they do this or not, there is but one object\nof contemplation--the wars that were in Heaven; one hope, and one alone--the\nconquest of the demons by the gods.\n\nEverywhere in India the feast that corresponds to the _Durga Puja_ is military\nin character. Perhaps fundamentally in consequence of the fact that, in the\nNorth at least, the rains are just over, the first seven days are spent in the\ncleaning and display of weapons; and on the tenth occurs the prostration and\nexhibition of skill in arms. Very curious is it at Nagpur on this day to see\nthe last scion of the Bhonslas set out on the stately promenade that was, to\nhis fathers, the beginning of a freebooting expedition, and long long before\nthat, a hunting party.\n\nBut domestically, in Bengal, it is a very different element in the festival\nthat determines the feeling\n\np. 59\n\nof the home with regard to it. The child to whose after life each flash of a\nwaterfall is to, carry its reminder, more or less vivid, of Durga with crown\nand sword, does not in its childhood itself conceive of Her as the cosmic\nenergy, appearing from amidst the ten points of the compass. For the Mother of\nthe Universe shines forth in the life of humanity as a woman, as family life,\nand as country. Here She is the maiden, perfect in beauty, nun-like in\nholiness, whose past and future are a glorified wifehood, on whose rapture of\ndevotion the eye of the Great God Himself has fallen, and who enters the\nIndian household, goddess and queen notwithstanding, as, after all, the little\nwedded daughter, returning for a ten-days\' visit to her father\'s house.\n\nTrue, as the lad draws nearer to manhood, he must realise that the father of\nthe guest is no less than Himalaya, and his daughter, therefore, the spouse of\nGod--according to the legend, Mother India herself. But this only gives\ncontinuity and ductility to his idea of the myth. First Durga, the ten-days\nvisitant; secondly, India, as Uma Haimavati; and lastly, Maha-Sakti, the\nInfinite Force; but always and increasingly as his power of recognition grows,\nthat ceaseless energy which works without and around him towards the due\nsubordination, by the forces of life and nature, of all that is vicious and\nunjust and out of place.\n\np. 60\n\nWith what tenderness and intimacy, then, does the Bengali child learn to\nconceive of his country and of God! It is a tenderness and intimacy which,\nbeginning with the use of images, may become inherent in a language and\ncharacteristic of old races. The Mohammedan boatman of Eastern Bengal is not\nin his own person a worshipper of Durga, and yet the words "With folded hands\nbefore the Mother" may carry as much to him as to the Hindu heart. Beyond a\ndoubt, however, it is its higher theological meaning which lends to the _Durga\nPuja_ its overwhelming elements of civic pageantry and national\ncomprehensiveness. Those who have studied religions as factors in social and\npolitical development must be conscious of the great variety of threads that\nare united in any single religious practice. What was it that made the Semitic\nraces worshippers of God the Father, and India the land of the worship of the\nMother? Can these vast tangles of social and geographical conditions ever be\ncompletely unravelled? And even so, does India stand alone in her\npersonification, or is it not more or less common to the whole of Eastern\nAsia? Regarding this last point, it is perhaps the fact that what exists\nelsewhere in fragments and survivals has been preserved and developed in India\nas a coherent whole. And within India itself, customs and doctrines bearing on\nthis worship, in more\n\np. 61\n\nor less of mutual un-relation, in many provinces, are in Bengal gathered\ntogether and woven into a single perfect piece. Who shall say how old was the\n_Chandi_ in this region when it was fitted into and accounted for, by the\n_Markandeya Purana?_ And where can we go, outside the province, that some echo\nof the old-time Mother-worship does not fall upon our ear?\n\nAman, the Mother, guards every village of the South. It was Bhowani, the\nterrible Mother, who led the Mahrattas to victory. The Mother, again, was\nworshipped by the Sikh, using his sword as her image. Kali was the patron\ngoddess of Chitore. To this day the great birthday is marked, in the Punjab\nand throughout the North-West Provinces, by the _Ram-Lilla_ , or miracle play\nof the Ramayana. To this day, in Mysore and all over the Dekkan, _Dussera\nPuja_ is the chief festival of the year. To this day, in every part of India,\nthe nine-days fast is performed by some member of every high-caste household.\nTo this day, in Madras, in Behar, and among families of military tradition\neverywhere, is Virashtamy, the solemn eighth day, the occasion of the worship\nand the tribute of the sword.\n\nIn Bengal, however, all these elements--social, military, and theological--are\ncombined and rationalised in the characteristic conception of the Divine\nMother as Durga-Kali-Jagadhattri:\n\np. 62\n\n[paragraph continues] Durga, the divine energy, making and destroying,\ndefeated and again conquering, impersonal and indifferent to personal desires;\nKali, mother of darkness, wielder of destruction, receiver of sacrifice, whose\nbenediction is death; and, finally, Jagadhattri, the tenderness of the heart\nof God, who shines in good women, and from whom came forth the Madonnas of the\nworld. It is in Bengal, too, when the image of the Mother has left her\nchildren for a space, when the nine days of worship and of charity are ended;\nit is in Bengal that the great tenth day is kept as that of the reknitting of\nhuman ties, and the _bijoya_ greetings of the family reunion go out throughout\nthe length and breadth of the land. For are not all bonds of kindred indeed\nsanctified and renewed year by year at the feet of the Divine Visitant? Is not\nthe whole of the country at one in the presence of the Mother?\n\nIt is more than thirty years since Bankim Chandra Chatterji, the great Bengali\nromancer, sang the vision of the ended _Durga Puja_ as the hour of the\nMotherland\'s need as he saw the image plunge beneath the waves. That the poet\nspoke the innermost thought of his countrymen, interpreting the yearly drama\nthat belongs to each one in a national sense, however distant he may be in the\nsectarian; that he voiced in his poem what each household and each individual\nhad known already\n\np. 63\n\nin the heart, is proved by the history that has gathered round his song. Every\nyear that goes by, the images of the Mother become more and more deeply, each\nin its turn, entwined with the thought of India to the Indian heart. Mother\nand Motherland--where ends the one and where begins the other? Before which\ndoes a man stand with folded hands, when he bows his head still lower, and\nsays with a new awe: "My Salutation to the Mother!"\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Festival of Ras](seh14.htm)\n\n'
