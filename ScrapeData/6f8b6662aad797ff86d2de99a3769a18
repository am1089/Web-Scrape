Garu\xe1\xb8\x8da said:--Tell me, O Ke\xc5\x9bava, how he who returns from hells is formed\nin the womb of the mother, and what miseries he suffers in the embryonic\ncondition.\n\n2\\. Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u said: I will tell you how the mortal is born when the male and\nfemale elements are bound together by the union of man and woman.\n\n3\\. In the middle of the menstruation period, in the three days on which Indra\nincurs the sin of Br\xc4\x81micide, the body of the sinful begins to form.\n\n4\\. The mother of one returning from hell is regarded on the first day as an\noutcaste woman, on the second as the murderer of a Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87, and on the third\nas a washerwoman.\n\n5\\. The creature, in obtaining a body, according to karma, the divine eye,\nenters the womb of a woman, which is the receptacle of a man\'s seed.\n\n6\\. In one night it becomes a lump; by the fifth night round; by the tenth day\nlike the fruit of the jujube tree, 1 and after that an egg of flesh.\n\np. 47\n\n7-8. By the first month the head, by the second the arms and other parts of\nthe body are formed; by the third occurs the formation of nails, hair, bones,\nskin, linga and other cavities;\n\nBy the fourth the seven bodily fluids; by the fifth hunger and thirst arise;\nby the sixth, enveloped by the chorion, it moves to the left of the womb.\n\n9\\. The bodily substances are formed of the foods and liquids of the mother,\nand the creature at the time of birth lies in the disgusting hollow of the\nloins, amid foeces and urine.\n\n10\\. All its limbs bitten constantly by hungry worms, it swoons away\nrepeatedly through excessive pain, as they are very tender.\n\n11\\. Thus enveloped by the womb and bound outside by the sinews, it feels pain\nall over its body, caused by the mother\'s eating many things--pungent, bitter,\nhot, salt, sour and acid.\n\n12\\. With its head placed in its belly and its back and neck curved, it is\nunable to move its limbs,--like a parrot in a cage.\n\n13\\. There he remembers, by divine power, the Karma generated in hundreds of\nprevious births,--and remembering, sobs for a long time, obtaining not the\nleast happiness.\n\n14\\. Having this insight he, with hands put together, bound in seven bonds,\nimploring and trembling, adores in plaintive tones Him who placed him in the\nwomb.\n\np. 48\n\n15\\. From the beginning of the seventh month, though he gains consciousness,\nhe who is in the womb trembles and moves about because of the parturition\nwinds, like a uterine worm.\n\n16-23. The creature says, "I seek refuge in Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u; the husband of \xc5\x9ar\xc4\xab, the\nsupporter of the universe, the destroyer of evil, who is compassionate to\nthose who come for shelter.\n\n"I am bewildered by Thy magic, as regards body and son and wife; misled by my\negoism I am transmigrating, O Lord.\n\n"I did good and evil actions for the sake of my dependents, and as s result I\nam tormented, while they who enjoy the fruits escape.\n\n"If I am released from this womb I will lay myself at Thy feet, and I will\ntake the means by which I may obtain liberation.\n\n"Fallen into a well of foeces and urine, I am burnt by the fire of the belly,\nand anxious to escape from it. When shall I get out?\n\n"In Him alone, who has given me this experience, and is compassionate to the\nafflicted, will I seek refuge. Let not this transmigration occur to me again.\n\n"But no, I wish never to come out of the womb, where misery results from my\nsinful actions.\n\np. 49\n\n"Because remaining even here in great misery, bearing the fatigue, resorting\nto Thy feet I will keep myself aloof from the worlds of change."\n\n24\\. The Blessed Lord said: He who has thus considered, and has been ten\nmonths in the womb, endowed with insight, while praying, suddenly is cast out\nhead downwards into birth, by the winds of delivery.\n\n25\\. Cast out forcibly, bending down his head, he comes out with anxiety and\npainfully breathless and with memory destroyed.\n\n26\\. Having fallen on the ground he moves like a worm in excrement. He is\nbecome changed in condition, and cries loudly, deprived of knowledge.\n\n27\\. If the state of mind which arises in the womb, during illness, on the\ncremation ground, or upon hearing the Pur\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as were permanent--who would not be\nliberated from bondage!\n\n28\\. When he comes out of the womb, after experiencing his karma, then verily\nthe man is bewildered by the magic of Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u.\n\n29\\. Then, when he is touched by that magic, powerless, he is unable to speak.\nHe experiences the miseries of infancy and childhood arising from dependence.\n\n30\\. He is nourished by people who do not understand his wishes, unable to\nward off what is thrust upon him against his desire.\n\n31\\. Lain upon a bed unclean and befouled by perspiration, he is unable to\nscratch his limbs, to sit, rise or move.\n\np. 50\n\n32\\. Mosquitoes, gnats, bugs and other flies bite him, skinless and weeping\nand deprived of understanding, just as insects bite little worms.\n\n33\\. In this wise having experienced the miseries of infancy and of childhood,\nhe reaches youth and acquires evil tendencies.\n\n34\\. Then he begins evil brooding, mingling in the company of the wicked; he\nhates the scriptures and good men, and becomes lustful.\n\n35\\. Seeing a seductive woman, his senses captivated by her blandishments,\ninfatuated he falls into great darkness, like a moth into a flame.\n\n36\\. The deer, the elephant, the bird, the bee and the fish: these five are\nled to destruction by one of the senses; how then shall the infatuated one not\nbe destroyed, when he enjoys the five kinds of objects by five senses.\n\n37\\. He longs for the unobtainable, and on account of ignorance becomes angry\nand sorry, and his pride and anger increase with the growth of his body.\n\n38\\. The lover makes quarrels with rivals, to his own ruin and is destroyed by\nthose stronger than himself, as one elephant by another.\n\n39\\. Who is more sinful than the fool who, attached to sense-objects, spends\nin vain the human birth which was difficult to obtain.\n\np. 51\n\n40: After hundreds of lives one obtains human birth on earth; and even more\ndifficult to obtain is that as a twice-born: and who then only provides for\nand pampers the senses, through foolishness lets slip the nectar from his\nhand.\n\n41\\. Then, having arrived at old age, he is troubled with great diseases; and,\ndeath having come, he goes to a miserable hell, as before.\n\n42\\. Thus held fast in the ever-circling noose of karma, the sinful,\nbewildered by my magic, are never released.\n\n43\\. Thus I have related to you, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya, how the sinful, deprived of the\nsacrifices for the dead, go in hell. What else do you wish to hear?\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[46:1](gpu08.htm#fr_59) That is, hard.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VII.
