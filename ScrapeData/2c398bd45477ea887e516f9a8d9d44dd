Janamejaya said :-- \xc2\x93O Bhagavan! A great doubt has arisen in my mind on\nthis subject. Who was it that took away that son, when both Lak _s_ mi and\nNaraya _n_ a left it, in that forlorn state, in a forest without any person\nthere to look after?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n3-11. Vyasa said :-- O King! No sooner Lak _s_ mi and Naraya _n_ a departed\nfrom that place, one Vidyadhara, named Champaka, mounting on a beautiful\ncelestial car came there at his free will, sporting with a woman named\nMadanalasa. There they saw that one lovely child, exquisitely beautiful like a\nDeva\xc2\x92s son, was playing alone as it liked. They then, quickly descended from\ntheir chariot and picked it up. Vidyadhara became very glad as a beggar\nbecomes glad, when he gets a hoard of jewels. On taking that newly born\nbeautiful child like a Cupid, Champaka gave it to the Devi Madanalasa.\nMadanalasa took it and became very much astonished; and her hairs stood at\ntheir ends. She clasped it to her bosom and kissed it frequently. O Bharata!\nTaking that child on her lap as if her own child, Madanalasa embraced it and\nkissed it and got the highest happiness. Then both of them took that child and\nmounted on the car. The lean Madanalasa then laughingly queried :-- \xc2\x93O Lord!\nWhose child is this? Who has left it in this forest? It seems to me Maha Deva,\ndesirous to give me a son, has given it unto me.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n12-18. Champaka said :-- I will just now go and ask the all-knowing Indra\nwhose child is this, whether it is of a Deva, Danava or Gandharva. If he\norders, I will purify this child found thus in this forest by the Veda\nMantrams and then accept it as my own. It is not advisable to do a thing\nsuddenly without knowing all the details. Thus saying to his wife Madanalasa,\nChampaka went with a gladdened heart hurriedly to the city of Indra with that\nchild in his arms. Champaka gladly bowed down at the feet of Indra and gave\nhim all the information he knew about the child and stood at one side with\nfolded hands and spoke, \xc2\x93O Lord of the Devas! I have got this child, beautiful\nas Cupid, in the sacred place of pilgrimage at the confluence of the Jumna and\nthe Tamasa. O Lord of S\xc2\x92achi! Whose child is this? and why did they forsake it\nthere? If\n\n\n\np. 554\n\n\n\nyou kindly permit, I will take this child as my own son. This child is very\nbeautiful and liked very much by my wife; it is also the rule laid down in the\nS\xc2\x92astras that one can accept any child as the Kritrima son. Therefore it is my\nearnest desire that I purify this child by the Veda Mantrams and take it\nlegally as my own son.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n19-24. Indra said :-- O Highly Fortunate One! Bhagavan Vasudeva, assuming the\nform of a horse, has produced this child out of the womb of Kamala in the form\nof a mare. He intends to give over the child, capable to destroy enemies to\nTurvasu, the son of Yayati, and thus will get a great purpose achieved by the\nchild. That King, very religious, will be sent by Hari today and he will come\nfor the child in that beautiful sacred place of pilgrimage. You better go back\nas early as possible and keep the child there as it was before till that king\ncomes to that spot at the instance of the Devadeva Vi _sn_ u. Do not waste a\nminute more. The King will be very sorry if he does not find the child there.\nTherefore O Champaka! Quit the attachment that you have for this child. You\nshould know that this child will be famous in this earth as Ekavira (only one\nhero).\n\n\n\n25-30. Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus hearing the Indra\xc2\x92s words, Champaka took\nthe child and went back immediately to the spot whence he picked it up and\nkeeping the child there as it laid, mounted on his car and went to his abode.\nAt that instant, the husband of Lak _s_ mi, the Lord of the three worlds, went\nto the King, mounted on His car, beaming with effulgent rays. When the\nBhagavan was descending from His aerial car, the King Turvasu was very glad to\nsee Him and bowed down and laid himself prostrate on the ground. The Bhagavan,\nthen, comforted the King, his own devotee, and said, \xc2\x93Get up, my child! Do\naway with your mental distress.\xc2\x94 The King also eagerly and full of devotion,\nbegan to utter verses in praise of the Bhagavan. O Lord of Rama! You are the\npresiding Deity of the Devas; Lord of the whole worlds, Ocean of Mercy and\nGiver of advice to all men. O Lord! Your sight is very rare even to the Yogis;\nbeing myself of a very slow dull intellect; I have been fortunate enough to\nsee you. O Lord! This shews Your mercy.\n\n\n\n31-54. Vyasa said :-- O Bhagavan! O Infinite One! Those who are free from any\ndesires and free from any attachment to worldly things, they alone are\nentitled to see Thee. O Deva of the Devas! I am bound in thousand and one\ndesires. I am quite unfit to see Thee. There is no doubt in this. When\nTurvasu, the best of the kings, praised thus, Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u became\npleased and began to speak in the following pleasant words :-- \xc2\x93O King! I am\npleased with your asceticism; now ask your\n\n\n\np. 555\n\n\n\ndesired boon; I will grant it immediately.\xc2\x94 The King bowed down again to the\nfeet of Vi _sn_ u and said :-- \xc2\x93O Murari! For the sake of a son, I have\npractised this tapasya; grant me a son like my Self.\xc2\x94 Naraya _n_ a, the First-\nborn of the Devas, hearing this King\xc2\x92s request spoke to him in infallible\nwords :-- \xc2\x93O son of Yayati! Go to the confluence of the Yamuna and Tamasa. For\nyou I have kept there today a son as you like and of indomitable prowess. O\nKing! That child is begotten by me in the womb of Lak _s_ mi.\xc2\x94 The King became\nvery glad to hear the sweet pure words of the Bhagavan. Thus granting him the\nboon, Vi _sn_ u went with Rama to Vaiku _nt_ ha. The King Turvasu, the son of\nYayati, hearing these words, became exceedingly gladdened in his heart and\nmounting on a chariot, whose speed cannot be checked, went to the spot where\nlay the child. The king, of extraordinary genius, went there and saw that the\nexceedingly beautiful child, catching hold of his toe by one of his soft hands\nwas sucking it by his mouth and was playing on the ground. The child was born\nof Naraya _n_ a out of the womb of Kamala. Therefore it resembled like Him. On\nlooking at that beautiful lovely child, the famous King Harivarma\xc2\x92s face got\ncheered up with the intensest delight. The King took it up with both of his\nhands and got merged in the Ocean of Bliss and taking gladly the scent of its\nhead embraced it happily. On looking at the beautiful lotus-face of the child,\nthe King, choked with tears from his eyes and with feelings of joy said :-- \xc2\x93O\nChild! Naraya _n_ a has given me, the child jewel in you; so save me from the\nterrors of the hell named Put. O Child! For full one hundred years I have\npractised a very hard tapasya for the sake of you. Pleased with that, the Lord\nof Kamala has given you to me for the happiness of my worldly career. Your\nMother Rama Devi has forsaken Her own child for the sake of me and has gone\naway with Hari. O Child! That Mother is blessed whose face beams with joy by\nseeing the smiles in your lotus-face. O Delighter of my heart! The Lord of\nRama, the Deva of the Devas, has made you, as it were, to serve as a boat for\nme for crossing to the other side of this Ocean of World.\xc2\x94 Thus saying, the\nKing took the child and gladly went home. Knowing that the King had come very\nclose to his city, the King\xc2\x92s Minister and the city people, the subjects came\nforward with the priest and many other presents and offerings. The bards,\nsingers and Sutas came in front of the King. The King as he entered into his\ncity looked affectionately on his subjects and gladdened their spirits by\nenquiries of welfare. Then worshipped by the citizens, the King entered into\nthe city with his child. As the King went along the royal road, the subjects\nshowered on his head the flowers and fried rice. Then taking the child by his\ntwo arms, the King entered into his prosperous palace with his ministers.\n\n\n\np. 556\n\n\n\nThe king next handed over the newly-born lovely child, as beautiful as Cupid,\nto the hands of his queen. The good queen took the child and asked the king\n:-- \xc2\x93O King! Whence have you got this new born child as fascinating as the God\nof Love? Who has given this child to you? O Lord! Speak quickly. This child\nhas stolen away my mind.\xc2\x94 The King gladly replied :-- \xc2\x93O Beloved! The Lord of\nKamala, the Ocean of Mercy has given me this child; O Quick-eyed One! This\nchild is born of Naraya _n_ a\xc2\x92s part and out of the womb of Kamala. O Devi!\nThis child has strength, energy, patience, gravity and all other good\nqualities.\xc2\x94 Then the queen took the child in her arms and got the unbounded\nbliss. Great festivities began to be performed in the palace of the King\nTurvasu. Charities were given to those that wanted; music and singing of\nvarious sorts were performed. In this ceremony for the sake of his child, the\nking Turvasu put the name of the child as \xc2\x93Ekavira.\xc2\x94 Getting thus the child\nequivalent in form and qualities to Hari, the powerful Indra-like king became\nhappy and freed from his debt due to his family line, became very cheerful and\nglad. O King! The king, powerful like his enemies, began to enjoy in his own\npalace with his all-qualified child, that was given to him by Naraya _n_ a,\nthe Lord of all the Devas. He was always served by his dear wife and all sorts\nof pleasures and he felt himself enjoying as a King would do.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twentieth Chapter in the Sixth Book on the son born of mare by\nHari, in the Mahapura _n_ am in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 21](bk06ch21.htm)\n\n'
