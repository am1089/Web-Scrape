You have fashioned [1](sbe3236.htm#an_5:54:1:1) this speech for the\nbrilliant Marut-host which shakes the mountains: celebrate then the great\nmanhood in honour of that host who praises the warm milk (of the sacrifice),\nand sacrifices on the height of heaven [2](sbe3236.htm#an_5:54:1:2), whose\nglory is brilliant.\n\n2\\. O Maruts, your powerful men (came) forth searching for water,\ninvigorating, harnessing their horses, swarming around. When they aim with the\nlightning, Trita shouts, and the waters murmur, running around on their\ncourse.\n\n3\\. These Maruts are men brilliant with lightning, they shoot with\nthunderbolts, they blaze with the wind, they shake the mountains, and\nsuddenly, when wishing to give water [1](sbe3236.htm#an_5:54:3:1), they whirl\nthe hail; they have thundering strength, they are robust, they are ever-\npowerful.\n\n4\\. When you drive forth [1](sbe3236.htm#an_5:54:4:1) the nights, O Rudras,\nthe days, O powerful men, the sky, the mists, ye shakers, the plains, like\nships, and the strongholds, O Maruts, you suffer nowhere.\n\n5\\. That strength of yours, O Maruts, that greatness extended far as the sun\nextends its daily course, when you, like your deer on their march, went down\nto the (western) mountain with untouched splendour\n[1](sbe3236.htm#an_5:54:5:1)\n\n6\\. Your host, O Maruts, shone forth when, O sages, you strip, like a\ncaterpillar, the waving tree [1](sbe3236.htm#an_5:54:6:1)\n\np. 326\n\n[paragraph continues] Conduct then, O friends, our service\n[2](sbe3236.htm#an_5:54:6:2) to a good end, as the eye conducts the man in\nwalking.\n\n7\\. That man, O Maruts, is not overpowered, he is not killed, he does not\nfail, he does not shake, he does not drop, his goods do not perish, nor his\nprotections, if you lead him rightly, whether he be a seer or a king.\n\n8\\. The men with their steeds, like conquerors of clans, like Aryaman (Mitra\nand Varu _n_ a) [1](sbe3236.htm#an_5:54:8:1), the Maruts, carrying waterskins\n[2](sbe3236.htm#an_5:54:8:2), fill the well; when the strong ones roar, they\nmoisten the earth with the juice of sweetness [3](sbe3236.htm#an_5:54:8:3).\n\n9\\. When the Maruts come forth this earth bows, the heaven bows, the paths in\nthe sky bow, and the cloud-mountains with their quickening rain.\n\n10\\. When you rejoice at sunrise, O Maruts, toiling together\n[1](sbe3236.htm#an_5:54:10:1), men of Svar (sun-light), men of Dyu (heaven),\nyour horses never tire in running, and you quickly reach the end of your\njourney.\n\n11\\. On your shoulders are the spears, on your feet rings, on your chests\ngolden chains, O Maruts, on your chariot gems; fiery lightnings in your fists,\nand golden headbands tied round your heads [1](sbe3236.htm#an_5:54:11:1).\n\n12\\. O Maruts, you shake the red apple [1](sbe3236.htm#an_5:54:12:1) from the\nfirmament, whose splendour no enemy [2](sbe3236.htm#an_5:54:12:2) can touch;\nthe hamlets bowed when the Maruts blazed, and the pious people (the Maruts)\nintoned their far-reaching shout.\n\n13\\. O wise Maruts, let us carry off [1](sbe3236.htm#an_5:54:13:1) the wealth\nof food which you have bestowed on us; give us [2](sbe3236.htm#an_5:54:13:2),\nO Maruts, such thousandfold wealth as never fails\n[3](sbe3236.htm#an_5:54:13:3), like the star Tishya\n[4](sbe3236.htm#an_5:54:13:4) from heaven!\n\n14\\. O Maruts, you protect our wealth of excellent men, and the seer, clever\nin song; you give to\n\np. 327\n\n[paragraph continues] Bharata (the warrior) [1](sbe3236.htm#an_5:54:14:1) a\nstrong horse [2](sbe3236.htm#an_5:54:14:2), you make the king to be obeyed\n[3](sbe3236.htm#an_5:54:14:3).\n\n15\\. O you who are quickly ready to help, I implore you for wealth whereby we\nmay overshadow all men, like the sky. O Maruts, be pleased with this word of\nmine, and let us speed by its speed over a hundred winters!\n\np. 328\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same poet, _S_ yava _s_ va \xc3\x82treya. Metre, 1-13, 15 _G_ agati; 14 Trish _t_\nubh. None of the verses of this hymn occurs in SV., VS., AV., TS., TB., MS.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Ana _g_ a, explained as a 2nd pers. plur. perf., referring to the same\npeople who are addressed by ar _k_ ata. It may be also the first person of the\nimperative; see Benfey, \xc3\x9cber die Entstehung der mit r anlautenden\nPersonalendungen, p. 5, note.\n\nNote 2. Possibly the second line of this verse may refer to ceremonial\ntechnicalities. Gharma means heat and summer, but also the sacrificial vessel\n(formus) in which the milk is heated, and the warm milk itself. Ya _g_ van can\nonly mean sacrificing, and diva _h_ p _ri_ sh _th_ a is the back of heaven,\nthe highest roof of heaven; see trip _ri_ sh _th_ a. Thus we read, I, 115, 3.\nharita _h_ \xe2\x80\xa6 diva _h_ a\xc2\xb4 p _ri_ sh _th_ am asthu _h_. See also I, 164, 10;\n166, 5; III, 2, 12; IX, 36, 6; 66, 5; 69, 5; 83, 2; 86, 27. It would seem\ntherefore as if the Maruts themselves were here represented as performing\nsacrificial acts in the highest heaven, praising the milk, that is, the rain,\nwhich they pour down from heaven to earth. Possibly the text is corrupt. If ya\n_g_ yu could have the same meaning as praya _g_ yu, I should like to\nconjecture, diva _h_ a\xc2\xb4 prish _th_ am ya _g_ yave. In IX, 61, 12. indraya ya\n_g_ yave seems to mean 'to the chasing Indra.' See also aya _g_ i (erjagend),\nobtaining. Might we conjecture diva a\xc2\xb4 p _ri_ kshaya\xc2\xb4vane? P _ri_ kshayama\noccurs as a name; see also II, 34, 3.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Abda, wish to give water, is very doubtful. Both abda and abdi, in\nabdimat, mean cloud. The text seems corrupt.\n\np. 329\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. The meaning of vya _g_ is doubtful. It may simply mean to make\nvisible.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. The last words ana _s_ vadam yat ni ayatana girim are difficult, Saya\n_n_ a has an explanation ready, viz. when you throw down the cloud or the\nmountain which gives no water or which 'does not give up the horses carried\noff by the Pa _n_ is. Grassmann too is ready with an explanation: 'Als ihr\nunnahbar glanzend, Hirschen gleich, den Berg auf eurer Fahrt durchranntet, den\nkein Ross erreicht.' Ludwig: 'Als ihr nider gehn machtet den nicht\nvergangliches gebenden (d. i. die waszer; oder: die rosse verweigernden?)\nberg.'\n\nGiri may be the cloud, and nothing could be more appropriate than that the\nMaruts should come down upon the cloud or go over it, in order to make it give\nup the rain. But a _s_ vada means 'giving horses,' and though rain-clouds may\nbe compared to horses, it does not follow that a _s_ va by itself could mean\nrain. A _s_ vada is used of the dawn, I, 113, 18, possibly as giving horses,\nthat is, wealth, but possibly also, as bringing the horses to the morning sun.\nThese horses start with the dawn or the sun in the morning, and they rest in\nthe evening. The legend that Agni hid himself in an A _s_ vattha tree (Saya\n_n_ a, RV. I, 65, 1) may owe its origin to a _s_ vattha, i. e. horse-stable,\nhaving been a name of the West (K. Z. I, 467); cf. tish _th_ adgu, at sunset.\nIn X, 8, 3, the Dawns are called a _s_ vabudhna _h_ , which may mean that they\nhad their resting-place among the horses. The Maruts, more particularly, are\nsaid to dwell in the A _s_ vattha tree, when Indra called them to his help\nagainst V _ri_ tra; cf. _S_ at. Brahm. IV, 3, 3, 6; Par. G _ri_ hy. II, 15, 4.\nPossibly therefore, though I say no more, possibly the Dawn or the East might\nhave been called a _s_ vada, the West ana _s_ vada, and in that case it might\nbe said that the Maruts are of unsullied splendour, when they\n\np. 330\n\ngo down to the western mountain. M. Bergaigne explains, 'La montagne qui ne\ndonne pas, qui retient le cheval, le cheval mythique, soleil ou eclair.' My\nown impression, however, is that ana _s_ vadam is an old mistake, though I\ncannot accept Ludwig's conjecture a-na _s_ va-dam. Why not anu svadha\xc2\xb4m, or\nana _s_ va-ya _h_ , moving without horses? cf. V, 42, 10.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. This is, no doubt, a bold simile, but a very true one. In one night\ncaterpillars will eat off the whole foliage of a tree, and in the same way a\nviolent storm in the autumn will strip every leaf. Ar _n_ asam as an\nadjective, with the accent on the last syllable, does not occur again, but it\ncan hardly mean anything but waving. If it will stand for the sea, we might\ntranslate, 'When you clear the waving sea (or air), as the caterpillar a\ntree.'\n\nNote 2. Aramati seems here to mean service or obedience, not a person who is\nwilling to serve.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. To translate aryama _n_ a _h_ by friends is unsatisfactory. Bergaigne\ntakes it for Aryaman, Mitra, and Varu _n_ a, the three Aryamans, as we say the\ntwo Mitras, and points out that these three gods do send rain, in I, 79, 3;\nVII, 40, 4.\n\nNote 2. It ought to be kavandhina _h_ as much as kavandha, V, 85, 3.\n\nNote 3. Madhva _h_ andhasa; Grassmann, 'mit des Honigs Seim.'\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. Sabharas is evidently a recognised epithet of the Maruts, see VS.\nXVII, 81 and 84, but its meaning is doubtful. We have vi _s_ vabharasam, IV,\nI, 19, as an epithet of Agni, which does not help us much. If bharas means\nburden, sabharas may mean those who work together, companions, friends.\n\np. 331\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. See Muir, S. T. V, p. 149. On sipra _h_ &c., see II, 34, 3, note.\n\n##### Verse 12.\n\nNote 1. The red apple to be shaken from the firmament can only be the\nlightning. Vi-dhu is construed with two accusatives, as in III, 45, 4; V, 57,\n3. Gaedicke, Accusativ, p. 266.\n\nNote 2. Arya _h_ cannot be a vocative, on account of the accent, nor a\nnominative on account of the context. There remains nothing but to take it as\na genitive, and connect it with ag _ri_ bhita, though such a construction has\nfew parallels, except perhaps in such sentences as havya _h_ _k_ arsha _n_\nina\xc2\xb4m, VI, 22, 1, &c. Possibly it may be intended as an epithet of the Maruts.\nBergaigne (Journ. As. 1884, p. 190), 'au profit du pauvre.' Geldner (Ved.\nStud. I, p. 148) proposes a very bold translation: 'The sacrificial nets are\nbeing contracted, when the Maruts rush on. The priests ( _ri_ tayu) roar their\n(as catching-net) extended shouting.' The sense is said to be that when the\nMaruts appear, all priests try to catch them by shouting. See, however,\nOldenberg in Gott. Gel. Anzeigen, 1890, p. 414.\n\n##### Verse 13.\n\nNote 1. For rathya\xcc\x83 _h_ , see II, 24, 1, 5. raya _h_ syama rathya\xcc\x83 _h_\nvayasvata _h_ ; VI, 48, 9.\n\nNote 2. Raranta, 2nd pers. plur. imp. intens., but Pada has raranta. Why not\nrarata?\n\nNote 3. Yu _k_ _kh_ ati has been compared by Kuhn (K. Z. III, 328) with\n\xce\xb4\xe1\xbd\xbb\xcf\x83\xce\xba\xce\xb5\xce\xb9; but see Brugmann, Grundriss, I, pp. 110, 118.\n\nNote 4. Tishya must be the name of a star, hardly, as Saya _n_ a suggests, of\nthe sun. It ought to be a star which does not set. See Weber, \xc3\x9cber alte\niranische Sternnamen, p. 14. Ludwig quotes from TS. II, 2, 10, 1 seq., an\nidentification of Tishya with Rudra.\n\np. 332\n\n##### Verse 14.\n\nNote 1. Grassmann marks this verse as late, Ludwig defends it. We must know\nwhat is meant by late before we decide. Bharata may mean simply a warrior, or\na Bharata; see Ludwig, III, 175-176; Oldenberg, Buddha (1st edition), p. 413.\n\nNote 2. \xc3\x81rvantam va\xc2\xb4 _g_ am, a horse, his strength. See Bergaigne, Rel. Ved.\nII, 405; Pischel, Ved. Stud. p. 46.\n\nNote 3. Could _s_ rush _t_ imat here mean obedient?\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 55. To the Maruts (the Storm-gods)](sbe3237.htm)\n\n"
