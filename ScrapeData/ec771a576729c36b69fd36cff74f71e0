After the \xc3\x82grahaya _n_ i (full moon follow) the three Ash _t_ akas.\n\n2 2. (The Ash _t_ aka is) sacred to Indra, to the Vi _s_ ve devas, to Pra _g_\napati, and to the Fathers.\n\n3 3. (The oblations are made) with cakes, flesh, and vegetables, according to\nthe order (of the three Ash _t_ akas).\n\n4\\. The first Ash _t_ aka (is celebrated) on the eighth day of the fortnight.\n\n5 5. Having cooked a mess of sacrificial food and having sacrificed the two \xc3\x82\n_g_ ya portions, he sacrifices \xc3\x82 _g_ ya oblations with (the texts):\n\n(a a) 'Thirty sisters go to the appointed place,\n\np. 342\n\nputting on the same badge. They spread out the seasons, the knowing sages;\nhaving the metres in their midst they walk around, the brilliant ones. Svaha!\n\n(b) 'The shining one clothes herself with clouds, with the ways of the sun,\nthe divine night: manifold animals which are born, look about in this mother's\nlap. Svaha!\n\n(c) 'The Ekash _t_ aka, devoting herself to austerities, has given birth to a\nchild, to the majesty of Indra. Through him the gods have conquered the\nhostile tribes; he became the killer of the Asuras through his (divine)\npowers. Svaha!\n\n(d d) 'You have made me who am not the younger (sister), the younger; speaking\nthe truth I desire this: may I be in his (i.e. the sacrificer's?) favour, as\nyou are; may none of you supplant the other in her work.\n\n(e) 'In my favour dwelt the omniscient one; he has found a firm standing; he\nhas got a footing. May I be in his (i.e. the sacrificer's?) favour, as you\nare; may none of you supplant the other in her work.\n\n(f f) 'On the five dawns follows the fivefold milking; on the cow with the\nfive names, the rive seasons. The five regions (of the sky) are established\n\np. 343\n\nthrough the fifteenfold (Stoma); with one common face (they look over) the one\nworld. Svaha!\n\n(g) 'She who shone forth as the first, is the child of truth. One (of them)\nbears the majesty of the waters; one wanders in the courses of the sun; one\n(in those) of the heat; Savit _ri_ shall govern one. Svaha!\n\n(h) 'She who shone forth as the first has become a cow in Yama's realm. Give\nus milk, thou who art rich in milk, year by year. Svaha!\n\n(i i) 'She, the owner of bright bulls, has come to us with clouds and with\nlight, she who has all shapes, the motley one, whose banner is fire. Carrying\non the common work, leading us to old age, come to us thou who art exempt from\nold age, Ushas! Svaha!\n\n(k) 'The consort of the seasons, the first one has come to us, the leader of\ndays, the producer of offspring. Being one, thou shinest manifold, Ushas.\nBeing free from old age, thou leadest to old age everything else. Svaha!'\n\n6 6. He makes offerings of the mess of cooked food with (the verses):\n\n'May the earth be peaceful, the air friendly to us;\n\np. 344\n\nmay the heavens give us bliss and safety. May the points (of the horizon), the\nintermediate points, the upper points give us bliss, and may day and night\ncreate long life for us. Svaha!\n\n'May the waters, the rays protect us from all sides; may the creator, may the\nocean turn away evil. The present and the future, may all be safe for me.\nProtected by Brahman, may I be well guarded. Svaha!\n\n'May all \xc3\x82dityas and the divine Vasus, may the Rudras and Maruts be our\nprotectors. May Pra _g_ apati, the highest lord, bestow on us vigour,\noffspring, immortality, long life. Svaha!'\n\n7\\. And with (the formula), 'To the Ash _t_ aka Svaha!'\n\n8\\. The middle Ash _t_ aka (is celebrated) with (the sacrifice of) a cow.\n\n9\\. He sacrifices the omentum of that (cow) with (the verse), 'Carry the\nomentum, O _G_ atavedas, to the fathers' (Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XXXV, 20).\n\n10\\. On the day following each (Ash _t_ aka), the Anvash _t_ aka day, (he\nbrings a sacrifice) with the left ribs and the left thigh, in an enclosure,\naccording to (the ritual of) the Pi _n_ _d_ apit _ri_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a.\n\n11\\. Also to the female (ancestors he makes Pi _n_ _d_ a offerings) and pours\n(for them) strong liquor and water oblations into pits, and (offers)\ncollyrium, salves, and garlands.\n\n12\\. (He may also make oblations), if he likes, to the teacher and to the\npupils who have no children.\n\np. 345\n\n13 13. And in the middle of the rainy season (there is) a fourth Ash _t_ aka\non which vegetables are offered.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[341:14](sbe29192.htm#fr_876) The verse occurs, with a few differences, in the\nKa _n_ va _S_ akha of the Va _g_. Sa _m_ hita, II, 7, 5.\n\n[341:1](sbe29193.htm#fr_877) 3, 1. On the Ash _t_ akas, celebrated on the\neighth days of the three dark fortnights following after the \xc3\x82grahaya _n_ i\nfull moon, see _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana III, 12 seqq.; \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana II, 4; Gobhila III,\n10.\n\n[341:2](sbe29193.htm#fr_878) As there are four deities named, I think it\nprobable that they are referred to all Ash _t_ akas indiscriminately; comp. \xc3\x82\n_s_ valayana II, 4, 12. Thus in the Mantras prescribed for the first Ash _t_\naka (Sutras 5 and 6), Indra, the Vi _s_ ve devas, and Pra _g_ apati are named;\nto the Fathers belongs the Anvash _t_ akya ceremony.\n\n[341:3](sbe29193.htm#fr_879) With regard to the order of these substances the\nG _ri_ hya texts differ.\n\n[341:5](sbe29193.htm#fr_880) Comp. Taitt. Sa _m_ hita IV, 3, 11; Atharva-veda\nIII, 10.\n\n[341:a](sbe29193.htm#fr_881) (a) The thirty sisters seem to be the days of the\nmonth. As to p. 342 madhye _kh_ andas, comp. Taitt. Sa _m_ h. loc. cit. \xc2\xa7 1:\n_kh_ andasvati ushasa pepi _s_ ane; \xc2\xa7 2: _k_ atush _t_ omo abhavad ya turiya\nya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ asya pakshav _ri_ shayo bhavanti, gayatri _m_ trish _t_ ubha _m_\n_g_ agatim anush _t_ ubham b _ri_ had arka _m_ yu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ana _h_ suvar\na\xe0\xa4\xbdbharann idam.\n\n[342:d](sbe29193.htm#fr_882) (d) Probably one Ash _t_ aka addresses the\nothers, her sisters, as _G_ ayarama explains this verse.\n\n[342:f](sbe29193.htm#fr_883) (f) The explanation by which the 'fivefold\nmilking' is referred to what is called in Taitt. Brahma _n_ a II, 2, 9, 'the\nmilkings of Pra _g_ apati,' seems to me more than doubtful, for 'the milkings\np. 342 of Pra _g_ apati' are only four: viz. the dark night, the moonlight,\nthe twilight, and the day.\n\n[343:i](sbe29193.htm#fr_884) (i) Sukra- _ri_ shabha cannot be translated, as\nProfessor Stenzler does, 'die schonste unter den Lichtern' (Madhava: _s_\nukreshu nakshatradishu _s_ resh _th_ a), for this meaning of _ri_ shabha\noccurs only in later texts. The word is a Bahuvrihi compound, as the\nPetersburg Dictionary explains it.\n\n[343:6](sbe29193.htm#fr_885) In the first verse I have omitted vya _s_ navai,\nwhich impedes the construction and violates the metre. The word has found its\nway into the text, no doubt, in consequence of the phrase dirgham ayur vya _s_\nnavai occurring in chap. 2, 2. In the second verse p. 344 ak _ri_ tad is\ncorrupt. I have translated abhayam; comp. \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana II, 4, 14. In the\nthird verse I have left out mayi, as Professor Stenzler has done in his\ntranslation.\n\n[345:13](sbe29193.htm#fr_886) I have stated in the note on _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana III,\n13, 1 my reasons for believing that the true reading of this Sutra is not\nmadhyavarshe (in the middle of the rainy season), but maghyavarshe (the\nfestival celebrated during the rainy season under the Nakshatra Maghas). There\nare no express rules given with regard to the third Ash _t_ aka, but I think\nwe should understand this Sutra as involving a statement on that Ash _t_ aka:\n(The third Ash _t_ aka) and the fourth, on the Maghyavarsha day, are Sakash\n_t_ akas (Ash _t_ akas on which vegetables are offered). _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana (G _ri_\nhya III, 13, 1) declares that the ritual of the fourth Ash _t_ aka is\nidentical with that of the second.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4](sbe29194.htm)\n\n"
