Charm against worms in cattle.\n\n1\\. The rising sun shall slay the worms, the setting sun with his rays shall\nslay the worms that are within the cattle!  \n2\\. The variegated worm, the four-eyed, the speckled, and the white--I crush\nhis ribs, and I tear off his head.  \n3\\. Like Atri, like Kanva, and like Gamadagni do I slay you, ye worms! With\nthe incantation of Agastya do I crush the worms to pieces.  \n4\\. Slain is the king of the worms, and their viceroy also is slain. Slain is\nthe worm, with him his mother slain, his brother slain, his sister slain.  \n5\\. Slain are they who are inmates with him, slain are his neighbours;\nmoreover all the quite tiny worms are slain.  \n6\\. I break off thy two horns with which thou deliverest thy thrusts; I cut\nthat bag of thine which is the receptacle for thy poison.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 23.
