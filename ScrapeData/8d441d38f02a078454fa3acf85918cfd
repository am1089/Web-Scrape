That which the text refers to is an inferential mark--thus.\n\nThe text describes the shape of Vai _s_ vanara, of whom heaven, &c., down to\nearth constitute the several limbs; and it is known from Scripture and Sm _ri_\nti that such is the shape of the highest Self. When, therefore, we recognise\nthat shape as referred to in the text, this supplies an inferential mark of\nVai _s_ vanara being the highest Self.--The 'thus' (iti) in the Sutra denotes\na certain mode, that is to say, 'a shape of such a kind being recognised in\nthe text enables us to infer that Vai _s_ vanara is the highest Self.' For in\nScripture and Sm _ri_ ti alike the highest Person is declared to have such a\nshape. Cp. e.g. the text of the \xc3\x81tha _r_ va _n_ as. 'Agni is his head, the sun\nand moon his eyes, the regions his cars, his speech the Vedas disclosed, the\nwind his breath, his heart the Universe; from his feet came the earth; he is\nindeed the inner Self of all things' (Mu. Up. II, I, 4). 'Agni' in this\npassage denotes the heavenly world, in agreement with the text 'that world\nindeed is Agni.' And the following Smr _ri_ ti texts: 'He of whom the wise\ndeclare the heavenly world to be the head, the ether the navel, sun and moon\nthe eyes, the regions the ears, the earth the feet; he whose Self is\nunfathomable is the leader of all beings'; and 'of whom Agni is the mouth,\nheaven the head, the ether the navel, the earth the\n\np. 290\n\nfeet, the sun the eye, the regions the ear; worship to him, the Self of the\nUniverse!'--Now our text declares the heavenly world and so on to constitute\nthe head and the other limbs of Vai _s_ vanara. For Kaikeya on being asked by\nthe _Ri_ shis to instruct them as to the Va _s_ vanara Self recognises that\nthey all know something about the Vai _s_ vanara Self while something they do\nnot know(for thus only we can explain his special questions), and then in\norder to ascertain what each knows and what not, questions them separately.\nWhen thereupon Aupamanyava replies that he meditates on heaven only as the\nSelf, Kaikeya, in order to disabuse him from the notion that heaven is the\nwhole Vai _s_ vanara Self, teaches him that heaven is the head of Vai _s_\nvanara, and that of heaven which thus is a part only of Vai _s_ vanara, Sute\n_g_ as is the special name. Similarly he is thereupon told by the other _Ri_\nshis that they meditate only on sun, air, ether, and earth, and informs them\nin return that the special names of these beings are 'the omniform,' 'he who\nmoves in various ways,' 'the full one,''wealth and 'firm rest,' and that these\nall are mere members of the Vai _s_ vanara Self, viz. its eyes, breath, trunk,\nbladder, and feet. The shape thus described in detail can belong to the\nhighest Self only, and hence Vai _s_ vanara is none other but the highest\nSelf.\n\nThe next Sutra meets a further doubt as to this decision not yet being well\nestablished.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 27.
