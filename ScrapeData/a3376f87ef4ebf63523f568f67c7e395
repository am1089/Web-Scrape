After that (there takes place) conjunction (of the soul) with him who\nperforms the act of generation.\n\nThe conclusion arrived at under the preceding Sutra is confirmed also by\nscripture stating that the souls, after having entered into plants, 'become'\nbeings performing the\n\np. 132\n\nact of generation, 'for whoever eats the food, whoever performs the act of\ngeneration, that again he (the soul) becomes.' Here again the soul's\n'becoming' he who performs the act of generation cannot be taken in its\nliteral sense; for a person becomes capable of generation a long time after\nhis birth only, viz. when he reaches puberty. How then should the soul\ncontained in the food eaten enter into that condition in its true sense? Hence\nwe must interpret the passage to mean only that the soul enters into\nconjunction with one who performs the act of generation; and from this we\nagain infer that the soul's becoming a plant merely means its entering into\nconjunction with a plant.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 1, 27](sbe38103.htm)\n\n"
