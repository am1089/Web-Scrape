He who is inflamed after the primitive ordinances, is anointed with\nointments [1](sbe46077.htm#an_3:17:1:1), the giver of all treasures, he whose\nhair is flame, whose stately robe is ghee, the purifier, skilled in sacrifice,\nAgni--that he may sacrifice to the gods.\n\n2\\. As thou hast performed, O Agni, the Hot _ri_ 's duty for the Earth, as\nthou hast done it for Heaven, O _G_ atavedas, full of intelligence, in the\nsame way sacrifice with this offering to the gods. Prosper this sacrifice to-\nday as thou hast done for Manus.\n\n3\\. Thou hast three lives, O _G_ atavedas, and three births from the Dawn\n[1](sbe46077.htm#an_3:17:3:1), O Agni! Being wise, sacrifice with these to the\nfavour of the gods, and bring luck and welfare to the sacrificer.\n\n4\\. Praising Agni full of splendour, full of beauty, we adore thee, O _G_\natavedas, deserving to be magnified. Thee the gods have made their messenger,\ntheir steward [1](sbe46077.htm#an_3:17:4:1), and carrier of offerings, the\nnavel of immortality.\n\n5\\. O Agni, the Hot _ri_ who before thee was an excellent sacrificer, who\nverily [1](sbe46077.htm#an_3:17:5:1) sat down and brought luck by himself\n[2](sbe46077.htm#an_3:17:5:2) sacrifice according to his rules, O intelligent\none, and set down our sacrifice at the feast of the gods.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe _Ri_ shi is Kata Vai _s_ vamitra, the metre Trish _t_ ubh.--Verse 1 = TB.\nI, 2, 1, 10. Verse 3 = TB. III, 2, 11, 2;\n\np. 276\n\n[paragraph continues] MS. IV, 11, 1; 12, 5. Verse 4 = TB. III, 6, 9, 1; MS.\nIV, 13, 5.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Possibly the poet intended to allude also to the other meaning of\naktubhi _h_ , which means both 'ointments' and 'nights.' The nights render\nAgni conspicuous and anoint (a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ) him as it were with beauty. I do not\nbelieve that the existence of a Vedic word aktu, 'ointment,' should be denied;\ncf. Bechtel, Nachrichten d. Gottinger Ges. d. Wiss. 1894, p. 398.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. See Bergaigne, Religion Vedique, II, 14. Prof. Max Muller translates:\nThree lives are thine, the dawns are thy three birthplaces, or three dawns are\nthy birthplaces.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. See above, I, 58, 7, note 1.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Literally, 'doubly.' Grassmann is right in observing that the Vedic\npoets show a certain predilection for the word dvita\xc2\xb4 when speaking of Agni's\nbeing established and doing his work at the sacrifice. Prof. Max Muller thinks\nof Agni's two homes, earth and heaven.\n\nNote 2. On the Hot _ri_ more ancient than Agni, comp. Bergaigne, Religion\nVedique, I, 109. Probably this simply refers to the Agni or the fire used at\nformer sacrifices.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 18](sbe46078.htm)\n\n"
