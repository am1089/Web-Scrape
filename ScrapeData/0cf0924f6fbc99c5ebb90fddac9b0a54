Salve (a\xc3\xb1gana) as a protector of life and limb.\n\n1\\. Come hither! Thou art the living, protecting eye-ointment of the mountain,\ngiven by all the gods as a safeguard, unto life.  \n2\\. Thou art a protection for men, a protection for cattle, thou didst stand\nfor the protection of horses and steeds.  \n3\\. Thou art, O salve, both a protection that crushes the sorcerers, and thou\nhast knowledge of immortality (amrita). Moreover, thou art food for the\nliving, and thou art, too, a remedy aorainst jaundice.  \n4\\. From him over whose every limb and every joint thou passest, O salve, thou\ndost, as a mighty intercepter, drive away disease.  \n5\\. Him that bears thee, O salve, neither curse, nor sorcery, nor burning pain\ndoes reach; nor does the,vishkandha come upon him.  \n6\\. From evil scheme, from troubled dream, from evil deed, and also from\nfoulness.; from the evil eye of the enemy, from this protect us, O salve!  \n7\\. Knowing this, O salve, I shall speak the truth, avoid falsehood. May I\nobtain horses and cattle, and thy person, O serving-man!  \n8\\. Three are servants of the salve: the takman (fever), the balasa, and the\nserpent. The highest of the mountains, Trikakud ('Three-peaks') by name, is\nthy father.  \n9\\. Since the salve of Trikakud is born upon the Himavant, it shall demolish\nall the wizards and all the witches.  \n10\\. Whether thou art derived from the (mountain) Trikakud, or art said to\ncome from the (river) Yamuna, both these names of thine are auspicious: with\nthese, O salve, protect us!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 10.
