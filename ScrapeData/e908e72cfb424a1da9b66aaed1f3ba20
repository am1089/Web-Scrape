Some (declare, that) he (who has studied the Veda) may make his choice\n(which) among the orders (he is going to enter). 1\n\n2\\. (The four orders are, that of) the student, (that of) the householder,\n(that of) the ascetic (bhikshu), (and that of) the hermit in the woods\n(vaikhanasa). 2\n\np. 193\n\n3\\. The householder is the source of these, because the others do not produce\noffspring. 3\n\n4\\. Among them a (professed) student (must follow the rules) given (in the\npreceding chapters). 4\n\n5\\. He shall remain obedient to his teacher until (his) end. 5\n\n6\\. In (the time) remaining after (he has attended to) the business of his\nGuru, he shall recite (the Veda). 6\n\n7\\. If the Guru dies, he shall serve his son,\n\n8\\. (Or) if there is no (son of the teacher), an older fellow-student, or the\nfire.\n\n9\\. He who lives thus, gains the heaven of Brahman, and (of him it is said\nthat) he has subdued his organs (of sense and action).\n\n10\\. And these (restrictions imposed on students Must also be observed by men)\nof other (orders, provided they are) not opposed (to their particular duties).\n10\n\n11\\. An ascetic shall not possess (any) store. 11\n\n12\\. (He must be) chaste,\n\n13\\. He must not change his residence during the rainy season. 13\n\np. 194\n\n14\\. He shall enter a village (only) in order to beg.\n\n15\\. He shall beg late (after people have finished their meals), without\nreturning (twice), 15\n\n16\\. Abandoning (all) desire (for sweet food).\n\n17\\. He shall restrain his speech, his eyes, (and) his actions.\n\n18\\. He shall wear a cloth to cover his nakedness.\n\n19\\. Some (declare, that he shall wear) an old rag, after having washed it. 19\n\n20\\. He shall not take parts of plants and trees, except such as have become\ndetached (spontaneously). 20\n\n21\\. Out of season he shall not dwell a second night in (the same) village. 21\n\n22\\. He may either shave or wear a lock on the crown of the head.\n\n23\\. He shall avoid the destruction of seeds. 23\n\n24\\. (He shall be) indifferent towards (all) creatures, (whether they do him)\nan injury or a kindness.\n\n25\\. He shall not undertake (anything for his temporal or spiritual welfare).\n\np. 195\n\n26\\. A hermit (shall live) in the forest subsisting on roots and fruits,\npractising austerities. 26\n\n27\\. Kindling the fire according to the (rule of the) _S_ ramanaka (Sutra, he\nshall offer oblations in the morning and evening). 27\n\n28\\. He shall eat wild-growing (vegetables only).\n\n29\\. He shall worship gods, manes, men, goblins, and _Ri_ shis. 29\n\n30\\. He shall receive hospitably (men of) all (castes) except those (with whom\nintercourse is) forbidden.\n\n31\\. He may even use the flesh of animals killed by carnivorous beasts. 31\n\n32\\. He shall not step on ploughed (land),\n\n33\\. And he shall not enter a village.\n\n34\\. He shall wear (his hair in) braids, and dress in (garments made of) bark\nand skins. 34\n\n35\\. He shall not eat anything that has been hoarded for more than a year. 35\n\np. 196\n\n36\\. But the venerable teacher (prescribes) one order only, because the order\nof householders is explicitly prescribed (in the Vedas). 36\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[192:1](sbe0267.htm#fr_890) **III**. Other Sm _ri_ tikaras maintain that a\nBrahma _n_ a must pass through all the four orders. Compare \xc3\x82pastamba II, 9,\n21, 5; Manu VI, 34-38; and the long discussion on the comparative excellence\nof the orders of householders and of ascetics. \xc3\x82pastamba II, 9, 2 3, 3-II, 9,\n2 4, 14.\n\n[192:2](sbe0267.htm#fr_891) \'Though the order of studentship has already been\ndescribed above, still in the following chapter the rules for a professed\n(naish _th_ ika) student will be given (and it had therefore again to be\nmentioned). Bhikshu has generally been translated by ascetic (sannyasin).\nVaikhanasa, literally, he who lives according to the rule promulgated by\nVikhanas, means hermit. For that (sage) has chiefly taught that order. In all\nother _S_ astras (the order of) hermits is the third, and (the order of)\nascetics the fourth. Here a different arrangement is adopted. The reason of\nthe displacement of the hermit is that the author considers the first-named\nthree orders preferable. Hence if a man chooses to pass through all four, the\nsequence is that prescribed in other _S_ astras.\'--Haradatta. In making these\nstatements the commentator has apparently forgotten that \xc3\x82pastamba (II, 9, 21,\n1) agrees exactly with Gautama. It is, however, very probable that Haradatta\nhas given correctly the reason why the hermit is placed last by our author and\nby \xc3\x82pastamba.\n\n[193:3](sbe0267.htm#fr_892) Manu VI, 87.\n\n[193:4](sbe0267.htm#fr_893) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 4, 29.\n\n[193:5](sbe0267.htm#fr_894) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 9, 21, 6.\n\n[193:6](sbe0267.htm#fr_895) According to Haradatta the term Guru here includes\nthe father. But see the next Sutra, where Guru can only mean the teacher.\n\n[193:10](sbe0267.htm#fr_896) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 9, 21, 3-4. My MSS. have\nuttaresham, \'of the later named,\' instead of itaresham, \'of the other\'\n(orders), both in the Sutra and in subsequent quotations of the same.\n\n[193:11](sbe0267.htm#fr_897) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 9, 21, 8-10; Manu VI, 41-43;\nColebrooke, Mitakshara II, 8, 7.\n\n[193:13](sbe0267.htm#fr_898) This rule shows that the Vasso of the Bauddhas\nand _G_ ainas is also derived from a Brahmanical source; see also Baudhayana\n11, 6, 11, 20.\n\n[194:15](sbe0267.htm#fr_899) Manu VI, 55-56.\n\n[194:19](sbe0267.htm#fr_900) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 9, 2 1, 11.\n\n[194:20](sbe0267.htm#fr_901) He shall not appropriate, i.e. take parts of\nthese, i.e. fruits, leaves, and the like, which have not been detached, i.e.\nhave not fallen off. But he may take what has become detached spontaneously.\'\n--Haradatta.\n\n[194:21](sbe0267.htm#fr_902) Out of season, i.e. except in the rainy season,\nduring which, according to Sutra 13, an ascetic must not wander about.\n\n[194:23](sbe0267.htm#fr_903) \'He shall avoid, i.e. neither himself nor by the\nagency of others cause the destruction, i.e. the pounding by means of a pestle\nor the like, of seeds, i.e. raw rice and the like. Hence he shall accept as\nalms cooked food only, not rice and the like.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[195:26](sbe0267.htm#fr_904) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 9, 21, 18-II, 9, 23, 2.\n\'Austerities (tapas) means emaciating his body.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[195:27](sbe0267.htm#fr_905) \'He shall offer oblations in the morning and\nevening,\' (these words), though not expressed, are understood.\n\n[195:29](sbe0267.htm#fr_906) i.e. he shall perform the five Mahaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as,\njust like a householder, only using wild-growing fruits, roots, &c., for the\noblations.\n\n[195:31](sbe0267.htm#fr_907) \'They declare, that baishka means the flesh of an\nanimal, slain by a tiger or the like. He may use even that. The word "even"\nimplies blame. Hence this is a rule for times of distress, and it must be\nunderstood that such food is to be eaten only on failure of roots and fruits\nand the like.\'--Haradatta. The commentator adds that the flesh of forbidden\nanimals must be avoided.\n\n[195:34](sbe0267.htm#fr_908) According to Haradatta the lower garment shall be\nmade of kira, which he again explains as cloth made of Ku _s_ a grass and the\nlike, and the upper of a skin.\n\n[195:35](sbe0267.htm#fr_909) Haradatta reads atisa _m_ vatsaram, not atisa _m_\nvatsaram, as in p. 196 Professor Stenzler\'s edition, though he notices the\nlatter reading. Manu VI, 15\n\n[196:36](sbe0267.htm#fr_910) \'The duties of a householder, the Agnihotra, and\nthe like, are frequently prescribed and praised in all Vedas, Dharma _s_\nastras, and Itihasas. As, therefore, the order of householders is explicitly\nprescribed, this alone is the order (obligatory on all men). But the other\norders are prescribed only for those unfit for the (duties of a householder).\nThat is the opinion of many teachers.\'--Haradatta. Haradatta\'s explanation of\na _k_ arya _h_ , which he takes to mean \'many teachers,\' seems to me\ninadmissible. Eke, \'some (teachers)\', is used in that sense, and a _k_ arya\n_h_ cannot possibly be a synonymous term. Further on (IV, 23) Haradatta\nhimself admits that by a _k_ arya _h_ one teacher is meant. It must be\ntranslated \'the venerable teacher,\' because the Hindus are very fond of the\nuse of the pluralis majestatis. I have no doubt that Gautama means his own\nteacher, whom, of course, etiquette forbids him to name. See also R.
