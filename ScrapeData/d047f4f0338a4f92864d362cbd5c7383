The Bhagavata Puran\xcc\x81a\n\n5\\. \xc5\x9ari Bhagavata. "That in which ample details of duty are described, and\nwhich opens with (an extract from) the Gayatri; that in which the death of the\nAsura Vritra is told, and in which the mortals and immortals of the Saraswata\nKalpa, with the events that then happened\n\np. xxv\n\nto them in the world, are related; that, is celebrated as the Bhagavata, and\nconsists of eighteen thousand verses 46." The Bhagavata is a work of great\ncelebrity in India, and exercises a more direct and powerful influence upon\nthe opinions and feelings of the people than perhaps any other of the\nPuran\xcc\x81as. It is placed the fifth in all the lists; but the Padma Puran\xcc\x81a ranks\nit as the eighteenth, as the extracted substance of all the rest. According to\nthe usual specification, it consists of eighteen thousand \xc5\x9blokas, distributed\namongst three hundred and thirty-two chapters, divided into twelve Skandhas or\nbooks. It is named Bhagavata from its being dedicated to the glorification of\nBhagavat or Vishn\xcc\x81u.\n\nThe Bhagavata is communicated to the Rishis at Naimisharan\xcc\x81ya by Suta, as\nusual; but he only repeats what was narrated by \xc5\x9auka, the son of Vyasa, to\nParikshit, the king of Hastinapura, the grandson of Arjuna. Having incurred\nthe imprecation of a hermit, by which he was sentenced to die of the bite of a\nvenomous snake, at the expiration of seven days; the king, in preparation for\n. this event, repairs to the banks of the Ganges; whither also come the gods\nand sages, to witness his death. Amongst the latter is \xc5\x9auka; and it is in\nreply to Parikshit\'s question, what a man should do who is about to die, that\nhe narrates the Bhagavata, as he had heard it from Vyasa; for nothing secures\nfinal happiness so certainly, as to die whilst the thoughts are wholly\nengrossed by Vishn\xcc\x81u.\n\nThe course of the narration opens with a cosmogony, which, although in most\nrespects similar to that of other Puran\xcc\x81as, is more largely intermixed with\nallegory and mysticism, and derives its tone more from the Vedanta than the\nSankhya philosophy. The doctrine of active creation by the Supreme, as one\nwith Vasudeva, is more distinctly asserted, with a more decided enunciation of\nthe effects being resolvable into Maya, or illusion. There are also doctrinal\npeculiarities, highly characteristic of this Puran\xcc\x81a; amongst which is the\nassertion that it was originally communicated by Brahma to Narada, that all\nmen whatsoever, Hindus of every caste, and even Mlechchhas, outcastes or\nbarbarians, might learn to have faith in Vasudeva.\n\np. xxvi\n\nIn the third book the interlocutors are changed to Maitreya and Vidura; the\nformer of whom is the disciple in the Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a, the latter was the\nhalf-brother of the Kuru princes. Maitreya, again, gives an account of the\nSrisht\xcc\x81i-lila, or sport of creation, in a strain partly common to the\nPuran\xcc\x81as, partly peculiar; although he declares he learned it from his teacher\nPara\xc5\x9bara, at the desire of Pulastya 47; referring thus to the fabulous origin\nof the Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a, and furnishing evidence of its priority. Again,\nhowever, the authority is changed, and the narrative is said to have been that\nwhich was communicated by \xc5\x9aesha to the Nagas. The creation of Brahma is then\ndescribed, and the divisions of time are explained. A very long and peculiar\naccount is given of the Varaha incarnation of Vishn\xcc\x81u, which is followed by\nthe creation of the Prajapatis and Swayambhuva, whose daughter Devahuti is\nmarried to Karddama Rishi; an incident peculiar to this work, as is that which\nfollows of the Avatara of Vishn\xcc\x81u as Kapila the son of Karddama and Devahuti,\nthe author of the Sankhya philosophy, which he expounds, after a Vaishn\xcc\x81ava\nfashion, to his mother, in the last nine chapters of this section.\n\nThe Manwantara of Swayambhuva, and the multiplication of the patriarchal\nfamilies, are next described with some peculiarities of nomenclature, which\nare pointed out in the notes to the parallel passages of the Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a.\nThe traditions of Dhruva, Ven\xcc\x81a, Prithu, and other princes of this period, are\nthe other subjects of the fourth Skandha, and are continued in the fifth to\nthat of the Bharata who obtained emancipation. The details generally conform\nto those of the Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a, and the same words are often employed, so\nthat it would he difficult to determine which work had the best right to them,\nhad not the Bhagavata itself indicated its obligations to the Vishn\xcc\x81u. The\nremainder of the fifth book is occupied with the description of the universe,\nand the same conformity with the Vishn\xcc\x81u continues.\n\nThis is only partially the case with the sixth book, which contains a variety\nof legends of a miscellaneous description, intended to illustrate the merit of\nworshipping Vishn\xcc\x81u: some of them belong to the early\n\np. xxvii\n\nstock, but some are apparently novel. The seventh book is mostly occupied with\nthe legend of Prahlada. In the eighth we have an account of the remaining\nManwantaras; in which, as happening in the course of them, a variety of\nancient legends are repeated, as the battle between the king of the elephants\nand an alligator, the churning of the ocean, and the dwarf and fish Avataras.\nThe ninth book narrates the dynasties of the Vaivaswata Manwantara, or the\nprinces of the solar and lunar races to the time of Krishn\xcc\x81a 48. The\nparticulars conform generally with those recorded in the Vishn\xcc\x81u.\n\nThe tenth book is the characteristic part of this Puran\xcc\x81a, and the portion\nupon which its popularity is founded. It is appropriated entirely to the\nhistory of Krishn\xcc\x81a, which it narrates much in the same manner as the Vishn\xcc\x81u,\nbut in more detail; holding a middle place, however, between it and the\nextravagant prolixity with which the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba repeats the story. It is not\nnecessary to particularize it farther. It has been translated into perhaps all\nthe languages of India, and is a favourite work with all descriptions of\npeople.\n\nThe eleventh book describes the destruction of the Yadavas, and death of\nKrishn\xcc\x81a. Previous to the latter event, Krishn\xcc\x81a instructs Uddhava in the\nperformance of the Yoga; a subject consigned by the Vishn\xcc\x81u to the concluding\npassages. The narrative is much the same, but something more summary than that\nof the Vishn\xcc\x81u. The twelfth book continues the lines of the kings of the Kali\nage prophetically to a similar period as the Vishn\xcc\x81u, and gives a like account\nof the deterioration of all things, and their final dissolution. Consistently\nwith the subject of the Puran\xcc\x81a, the serpent Takshaka bites Parikshit, and he\nexpires, and the work should terminate; or the close might be extended to the\nsubsequent sacrifice of Janamejaya for the destruction of the whole serpent\nrace. There is a rather awkwardly introduced description, however, of the\narrangement of the Vedas and Puran\xcc\x81as by Vyasa,\n\np. xxviii\n\nand the legend of Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya\'s interview with the infant Krishn\xcc\x81a, during a\nperiod of worldly dissolution. We then come to the end of the Bhagavata, in a\nseries of encomiastic commendations of its own sanctity, and efficacy to\nsalvation.\n\nMr. Colebrooke observes of the Bhagavata Puran\xcc\x81a, "I am inclined to adopt an\nopinion supported by many learned Hindus, who consider the celebrated \xc5\x9ari\nBhagavata as the work of a grammarian (Vopadeva), supposed to have lived six\nhundred years ago 49." Col. Vans Kennedy considers this an incautious\nadmission, because "it is unquestionable that the number of the Puran\xcc\x81as has\nbeen always held to be eighteen; but in most of the Puran\xcc\x81as the names of the\neighteen are enumerated, amongst which the Bhagavata is invariably included;\nand consequently if it were composed only six hundred years ago, the others\nmust be of an equally modern date 50." Some of them are no doubt more recent;\nbut, as already remarked, no weight can be attached to the specification of\nthe eighteen names, for they are always complete; each Puran\xcc\x81a enumerates all.\nWhich is the last? which had the opportunity of naming its seventeen\npredecessors, and adding itself? The argument proves too much. There can be\nlittle doubt that the list has been inserted upon the authority of tradition,\neither by some improving transcriber, or by the compiler of a work more recent\nthan the eighteen genuine Puran\xcc\x81as. The objection is also rebutted by the\nassertion, that there was another Puran\xcc\x81a to which the name applies, and which\nis still to be met with, the Devi Bhagavata.\n\nFor, the authenticity of the Bhagavata is one of the few questions affecting\ntheir sacred literature which Hindu writers have ventured to discuss. The\noccasion is furnished by the text itself. In the fourth chapter of the first\nbook it is said that Vyasa arranged the Vedas, and divided them into four; and\nthat he then compiled the Itihasa and Puran\xcc\x81as, as a fifth Veda. The Vedas he\ngave to Paila and the rest; the Itihasa and Puran\xcc\x81as to Lomaharshan\xcc\x81a, the\nfather of Suta 51. Then reflecting that these works may not be accessible to\nwomen, \xc5\x9audras, and\n\np. xxix\n\nmixed castes, he composed the Bharata, for the purpose of placing religious\nknowledge within their reach. Still he felt dissatisfied, and wandered in much\nperplexity along the banks of the Saraswati, where his hermitage was situated,\nwhen Narada paid him a visit. Having confided to him his secret and seemingly\ncauseless dissatisfaction, Narada suggested that it arose from his not having\nsufficiently dwelt, in the works he had finished, upon the merit of\nworshipping Vasudeva. Vyasa at once admitted its truth, and found a remedy for\nhis uneasiness in the composition of the Bhagavata, which he taught to \xc5\x9auka\nhis son 52. Here therefore is the most positive assertion that the Bhagavata\nwas composed subsequently to the Puran\xcc\x81as, and given to a different pupil, and\nwas not therefore one of the eighteen of which Romaharshan\xcc\x81a the Seta was,\naccording to all concurrent testimonies, the depositary. Still the Bhagavata\nis named amongst the eighteen Puran\xcc\x81as by the inspired authorities; and how\ncan these incongruities be reconciled?\n\nThe principal point in dispute seems to have been started by an expression of\n\xc5\x9aridhara Swamin, a commentator on the Bhagavata, who somewhat incautiously\nmade the remark that there was no reason to suspect that by the term Bhagavata\nany other work than the subject of his labours was intended. This was\ntherefore an admission that some suspicions had been entertained of the\ncorrectness of the nomenclature, and that an opinion had been expressed that\nthe term belonged, not to the \xc5\x9ari Bhagavata, but to the Devi Bhagavata; to a\n\xc5\x9aaiva, not a Vaishn\xcc\x81ava, composition. With whom doubts prevailed prior to\n\xc5\x9aridhara Swamin, or by whom they were urged, does not appear; for, as far as\nwe are aware, no works, anterior to his date, in which they are advanced have\nbeen met with. Subsequently, various tracts have been written on the subject.\nThere are three in the library of the East India Company; the Durjana Mukha\nChapet\xcc\x81ika, \'A slap of the face for the vile,\' by Rama\xc5\x9brama; the Durjana Mukha\nMaha Chapet\xcc\x81ika, \'A great slap of the face for the wicked,\' by Ka\xc5\x9binath\nBhat\xcc\x81t\xcc\x81a; and the Durjana Mukha Padma Pad\xcc\x81uka, \'A slipper\' for the same part\nof the same persons, by a\n\np. xxx\n\nnameless disputant. The first maintains the authenticity of the Bhagavata; the\nsecond asserts that the Devi Bhagavata is the genuine Puran\xcc\x81a; and the third\nreplies to the arguments of the first. There is also a work by Purushottama,\nentitled \'Thirteen arguments for dispelling all doubts of the character of the\nBhagavata\' (Bhagavata swarupa vihsaya \xc5\x9banka nirasa trayodasa); whilst\nBalambhat\xcc\x81t\xcc\x81a, a commentator on the Mitakshara, indulging in a dissertation on\nthe meaning of the word Puran\xcc\x81a, adduces reasons for questioning the inspired\norigin of this Puran\xcc\x81a.\n\nThe chief arguments in favour of the authenticity of this Puran\xcc\x81a are the\nabsence of any reason why Vopadeva, to whom it is attributed, should not have\nput his own name to it; its being included in all lists of the Puran\xcc\x81as,\nsometimes with circumstances that belong to no other Puran\xcc\x81a; and its being\nadmitted to be a Puran\xcc\x81a, and cited as authority, or made the subject of\ncomment, by writers of established reputation, of whom \xc5\x9aankara \xc3\x81charya is one,\nand he lived long before Vopadeva. The reply to the first argument is rather\nfeeble, the controversialists being unwilling perhaps to admit the real\nobject, the promotion of new doctrines. It is therefore said that Vyasa was an\nincarnation of Narayan\xcc\x81a, and the purpose was to propitiate his favour. The\ninsertion of a Bhagavata amongst the eighteen Puran\xcc\x81as is acknowledged; but\nthis, it is said, can be the Devi Bhagavata alone, for the circumstances apply\nmore correctly to it than to the Vaishn\xcc\x81ava Bhagavata. Thus a text is quoted\nby Ka\xc5\x9binath from a Puran\xcc\x81a--he does not state which--that says of the\nBhagavata that it contains eighteen thousand verses, twelve books, and three\nhundred and thirty-two chapters. Ka\xc5\x9binath asserts that the chapters of the \xc5\x9ari\nBhagavata are three hundred and thirty-five, and that the numbers apply\nthroughout only to the Devi Bhagavata. It is also said that the Bhagavata\ncontains an account of the acquirement of holy knowledge by Hayagriva; the\nparticulars of the Saraswata Kalpa; a dialogue between Ambarisha and \xc5\x9auka; and\nthat it commences with the Gayatri, or at least a citation of it. These all\napply to the Devi Bhagavata alone, except the last; but it also is more true\nof the \xc5\x9aaiva than of the Vaishn\xcc\x81ava work, for the latter has only one word of\nthe Gayatri, dhimahi, \'we meditate;\' whilst the former to dhimahi adds, Ya nah\nprachodayat,\n\np. xxxi\n\n[paragraph continues] \'who may enlighten us.\' To the third argument it is in\nthe first place objected, that the citation of the Bhagavata by modern writers\nis no test of its authenticity; and with regard to the more ancient commentary\nof \xc5\x9aankara \xc3\x81charya, it is asked, "Where is it?" Those who advocate the\nsanctity of the Bhagavata reply, "It was written in a difficult style, and\nbecame obsolete, and is lost." "A very unsatisfactory plea," retort their\nopponents, "for we still have the works of \xc5\x9aankara, several of which are quite\nas difficult as any in the Sanscrit language." The existence of this comment,\ntoo, rests upon the authority of Madhwa or Madhava, who in a commentary of his\nown asserts that he has consulted eight others. Now amongst these is one by\nthe monkey Hanuman; and although a Hindu disputant may believe in the reality\nof such a composition, yet we may receive its citation as a proof that Madhwa\nwas not very scrupulous in the verification of his authorities.\n\nThere are other topics urged in this controversy on both sides, some of which\nare simple enough, some are ingenious: but the statement of the text is of\nitself sufficient to shew that according to the received opinion of all the\nauthorities of the priority of the eighteen Puran\xcc\x81as to the Bharata, it is\nimpossible that the \xc5\x9ari Bhagavata, which is subsequent to the Bharata, should\nbe of the number; and the evidence of style, the superiority of which to that\nof the Puran\xcc\x81as in general is admitted by the disputants, is also proof that\nit is the work of a different hand. Whether the Devi Bhagavata have a better\ntitle to be considered as an original composition of Vyasa, is equally\nquestionable; but it cannot be doubted that the \xc5\x9ari Bhagavata is the product\nof uninspired erudition. There does not seem to be any other ground than\ntradition for ascribing it to Vopadeva the grammarian; but there is no reason\nto call the tradition in question. Vopadeva flourished at the court of\nHemadri, Raja of Devagiri, Deogur or Dowlutabad, and must consequently have\nlived prior to the conquest of that principality by the Mohammedans in the\nfourteenth century. The date of the twelfth century, commonly assigned to him,\nis probably correct, and is that of the Bhagavata Puran\xcc\x81a.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xxv:46](vp009.htm#fr_45) [![](tn/generic.jpg)  \nClick to view](img/_02500.jpg)\n\n[xxvi:47](vp009.htm#fr_46) See p. 5.\n\n[xxvii:48](vp009.htm#fr_47) A translation of the ninth, by Capt.
