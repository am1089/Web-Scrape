 \nNor failed his roving eye to mark  \nTall aloe trees in grove and park.  \nHe looked on wood with cassias filled,  \nAnd plants which balmy sweets distilled,  \nWhere her fair flowers the betel showed  \nAnd the bright pods of pepper glowed.  \nThe pearls in many a silvery heap  \nLay on the margin of the deep.  \nAnd grey rocks rose amid the red  \nOf coral washed from ocean\'s bed.  \n\np. 271  \n\nHigh soared the mountain peaks that bore  \nTreasures of gold and silver ore,  \nAnd leaping down the rocky walls  \nCame wild and glorious waterfalls.  \nFair towns which grain and treasure held,  \nAnd dames who every gem excelled,  \nHe saw outspread beneath him far,  \nWith steed, and elephant, and car.  \nThat ocean shore he viewed that showed  \nFair as the blessed Gods\' abode  \nWhere cool delightful breezes played  \nO\'er levels in the freshest shade.  \nHe saw a fig-tree like a cloud  \nWith mighty branches earthward bowed.  \nIt stretched a hundred leagues and made  \nFor hermit bands a welcome shade.  \nThither the feathered king of yore  \nAn elephant and tortoise bore,  \nAnd lighted on a bough to eat  \nThe captives of his taloned feet.  \nThe bough unable to sustain  \nThe crushing weight and sudden strain,  \nLoaded with sprays and leaves of spring  \nGave way beneath the feathered king.  \nUnder the shadow of the tree  \nDwelt man, a saint and devotee,  \n\xc3\x81jas, the sons of Brahma\'s line,  \nMashas Marichipas divine.  \nVaikhanasas, and all the race  \nOf Balakhilyas loved the place.  \nBut pitying their sad estate  \nThe feathered monarch raised the weight  \nOf the huge bough, and bore away  \nThe loosened load and captured prey.  \nA hundred leagues away he sped,  \nThen on his monstrous booty fed,  \nAnd with the bough he smote the lands  \nWhere dwell the wild Nishada bands.  \nHigh joy was his because his deed  \nFrom jeopardy the hermits freed.  \nThat pride for great deliverance wrought  \nA double share of valour brought.  \nHis soul conceived the high emprise  \nTo snatch the Amrit from the skies.  \nHe rent the nets of iron first,  \nThen through the jewel chamber burst,  \nAnd bore the drink of heaven away  \nThat watched in Indra\'s palace lay.  \n\nSuch was the hermit-sheltering tree  \nWhich Ravan turned his eye to see.  \nStill marked where Garud sought to rest,  \nThe fig-tree bore the name of Blest.  \n\nWhen Ravan stayed his chariot o\'er  \nThe ocean\'s heart-enchanting shore,  \nHe saw a hermitage that stood  \nSequestered in the holy wood.  \nHe saw the fiend Maricha there  \nWith deerskin garb, and matted hair  \nCoiled up in hermit guise, who spent  \nHis days by rule most abstinent.  \nAs guest and host are wont to meet,  \n\nThey met within that lone retreat.  \nBefore the king Maricha placed  \nFood never known to human taste.  \nHe entertained his guest with meat  \nAnd gave him water for his feet,  \nAnd then addressed the giant king  \nWith timely words of questioning:  \n\n\'Lord, is "it well with thee, and well  \nWith those in Lanka\'s town who dwell?  \nWhat sudden thought, what urgent need  \nHas brought thee with impetuous speed?  \n\nThe fiend Maricha thus addressed  \nRavan the king, his mighty guest,  \nAnd he, well skilled in arts that guide  \nThe eloquent, in turn replied:  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[270:1](ry233.htm#fr_489) Beings with the body of a man and the head of a\nhorse.\n\n[270:2](ry233.htm#fr_490) \xc3\x81jas, Marichipas, Vaikhanasas, Mashas, and\nBalakhilyas are classes of supernatural beings who lead the lives of hermits.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXXVI.: Ravan\'s Speech.](ry234.htm)\n\n'
