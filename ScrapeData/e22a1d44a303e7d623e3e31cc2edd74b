Or on account of (its) quality (viz. intelligence), as in cases of\nordinary experience.\n\np. 40\n\nThat the soul although atomic produces effects extending over the whole body,\nis not contrary to reason, on account of the pervadingness of intellect which\nis its quality. From ordinary experience we know that luminous things, such as\nlamps or gems, although occupying only one spot of a chamber, produce, by\nmeans of their light which fills the chamber, an effect in every part of the\nchamber.--This Sutra has the purpose of removing the doubts of those who might\nobject that sandal-ointment, because consisting of parts, may perhaps refresh\nthe entire body by the diffusion of imperceptible particles; that, however,\nthe soul as a mere atom does not possess any parts by means of which it could\ndiffuse itself through the whole body.--But how can a quality extend beyond\nthat in which it inheres, and abide elsewhere? We certainly do not see that\nthe whiteness which is the quality of a piece of cloth extends beyond that\npiece of cloth to other places. Nor must you say that the case of the soul is\nanalogous to that of the light diffused from a lamp; for that light itself is\nadmitted to be (not a quality but) a substance. The flame of a lamp is\nsubstantial light with its particles crowded close to one another; the light\ndiffused from that flame is substantial light whose particles are thin and\nscattered.--The reply to this objection is given in the next Sutra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 26](sbe38027.htm)\n\n'
