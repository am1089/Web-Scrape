In the beginning this (world) was water. Water produced the true 1, and\nthe true is 'Brahman. Brahman produced Pra _g_ apati 2, Pra _g_ apati the\nDevas (gods). The Devas adore the true (satyam) alone. This satyam consists of\nthree syllables. One syllable is sa, another t(i), the third 3 yam. The first\nand last syllables are true, in the middle there is the untrue 4. This untrue\nis on both sides enclosed by the true, and thus the true preponderates. The\nuntrue does not hurt him who knows this.\n\n2\\. Now what is the true, that is the \xc3\x82ditya (the sun), the person that dwells\nin yonder orb, and the person in the right eye. These two rest on each other,\nthe former resting with his rays in the latter, the latter with his pra _n_ as\n(senses) in the former. When the latter is on the point of departing this\nlife, he sees that orb as white only, and those rays (of the sun) do not\nreturn to him.\n\np. 192\n\n3\\. Now of the person in that (solar) orb Bhu _h_ is the head, for the head is\none, and that syllable is one; Bhuva _h_ the two arms, for the arms are two,\nand these syllables are two; Svar the foot, for the feet are two, and these\nsyllables are two 1. Its secret name is Ahar (day), and he who knows this\ndestroys (hanti) evil and leaves ( _g_ ahati) it.\n\n4\\. Of the person in the right eye Bhu _h_ is the head, for the head is one,\nand that syllable is one; Bhuva _h_ the two arms, for the arms are two, and\nthese syllables are two; Svar the foot, for the feet are two, and these\nsyllables are two. Its secret name is Aham (ego), and he who knows this,\ndestroys (hanti) evil and leaves ( _g_ ahati) it.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[191:1](sbe15083.htm#fr_556) Here explained by the commentator as Putratmaka\nHira _n_ yagarbha.\n\n[191:2](sbe15083.htm#fr_557) Here explained as Vira _g_.\n\n[191:3](sbe15083.htm#fr_558) Satyam is often pronounced satiam, as\ntrisyllabic. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, however, takes the second syllable as t only, and\nexplains the i after it as an anubandha. The Ka _n_ va text gives the three\nsyllables as sa, ti, am, which seems preferable; cf. _Kh_ and. Up. VIII, 3, 5;\nTaitt. Up. II, 6.\n\n[191:4](sbe15083.htm#fr_559) This is explained by a mere play on the letters,\nsa and ya having nothing in common with m _ri_ tyu, death, whereas t occurs in\nm _ri_ tyu and an _ri_ ta. Dvivedaga\xe1\xb9\x85ga takes sa and am as true, because they\noccur in satya and am _ri_ ta, and not in m _ri_ tyu, while ti is untrue,\nbecause the t occurs in m _ri_ tyu and am _ri_ ta.\n\n[192:1](sbe15083.htm#fr_560) Svar has to be pronounced suvar.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 6](sbe15084.htm)\n\n"
