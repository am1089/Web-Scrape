Being well lighted, O Agni, bring us hither\nthe gods to the man rich in sacrificial food, O Hot _ri_ , purifier, and\nperform the sacrifice.\n\n2\\. Tanunapat [1](sbe46005.htm#an_1:13:2:1)! make our sacrifice rich in honey\nand convey it to-day to the gods, O sage, that they may feast.\n\n3\\. I invoke here at this sacrifice Nara _s_ a _m_ sa\n[1](sbe46005.htm#an_1:13:3:1), the beloved one, the honey-tongued preparer of\nthe sacrificial food.\n\n4\\. O magnified [1](sbe46005.htm#an_1:13:4:1) Agni! Conduct the gods hither in\nan easy-moving chariot. Thou art the Hot _ri_ instituted by Manus\n[2](sbe46005.htm#an_1:13:4:2).\n\n5\\. Strew, O thoughtful men, in due order [1](sbe46005.htm#an_1:13:5:1) the\nsacrificial grass, the back (or surface) of which is sprinkled with butter, on\nwhich the appearance of immortality [2](sbe46005.htm#an_1:13:5:2) (is seen).\n\n6\\.

May the giver's splendour be foremost.\n\n12\\. Offer ye the sacrifice with the word Svaha to Indra in the sacrificer's\nhouse. Thereto I invoke the gods.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe hymn is ascribed, as the whole collection to which it belongs, to\nMedhatithi Ka _n_ va (see the note on the preceding hymn). Its metre is\nGayatri. Verses 1-4 = SV. II, 697-700\\. Verse 9 = RV. V, 5, 8. Verse 10 = TS.\nIII, 1, 11, 1; TB. III, 5, 12, 1; MS. IV, 13, 10.\n\nThe hymn belongs to the class of \xc3\x82pri hymns, which were classed by the ancient\narrangers of the Sa _m_ hita among the Agni hymns. The \xc3\x82pri hymns, consisting\nof eleven or twelve verses, were destined for the Praya _g_ a offerings of the\nanimal sacrifice (comp. H. O., Zeitschrift der D. Morg. Gesellschaft, XLII,\n243 seq.). They were addressed, verse by verse in regular order, partly to\nAgni, partly to different spirits or deified objects connected with the\nsacrifice, such as the sacrificial grass, the divine gates through which the\ngods had to pass on their way to the sacrifice, &c. The second verse was\naddressed by some of the _Ri_ shi families to Tanunapat by some to Nara _s_ a\n_m_ sa; in some of the hymns we find two verses instead of one (so that the\ntotal number of verses becomes twelve instead of eleven) addressed the one to\nTanunapat, the other to Nara _s_ a _m_ sa. Bergaigne (Recherches sur\nl'histoire de la Liturgie Vedique, p. 14) conjectures that some of the _Ri_\nshi families had only seven Praya _g_ as. This opinion is based on the\nidentical appearance of four verses (8-11) in the \xc3\x82pri hymns of the Vi _s_\nvamitras (III, 4) and of the Vasish _th_ as (VII, 2), and on the diversity of\nmetres used in two other \xc3\x82pri hymns, IX, 5 and II, 3. To me this conjecture,\nthough very ingenious, does not seem convincing.\n\np. 10\n\nWith the text of the \xc3\x82pri hymns should be compared the corresponding Praishas\nof the Maitravaru _n_ a priest, i. e. the orders by which this priest directed\nthe Hot _ri_ to pronounce the Praya _g_ a invocations. The text of these\nPraishas is given Taitt. Brahm. III, 6, 2.\n\nComp. on the character and the historical and ritual position of the \xc3\x82pri\nhymns, Max Muller, Hist. Anc. Sansc. Literature, p. 403 seq.; Roth, Nirukta,\nnotes, p. 121 seq.; Weber, Indische Studien, X, 89 seq.; Ludwig V, 315 seq.;\nHillebrandt, Das Altindische Neu- und Vollmondsopfer, 94 seq.; Schwab, Das\nAltindische Thieropfer, 90 seq.; Bergaigne, Recherches sur l'histoire de la\nLiturgie Vedique, 13 seq.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Comp. Delbruck, Syntactische Forschungen, I, 97.\n\n##### Verses 2, 3.\n\nNote 1. Does Tanunapat, lit. 'son of the body,' mean, as Roth and Grassmann\nbelieved, 'son of his own self' (comp. I, 12, 6. agnina agni _h_ sam idhyate,\n'by Agni Agni is kindled'), or is the meaning 'le propre fils' (Bergaigne,\nRel. Vedique II, 100)? Nara _s_ a _m_ sa, which is nearly identical with the\nAvestic Nairyosa\xe1\xb9\x85ha, means 'the song of men,' or 'praised by men' (Bergaigne,\nl. l. I, 305; M. M.'s note on VII, 46, 4). In III, 29, 11 it is said of Agni:\nHe is called Tanunapat as the foetus of the Asura; he becomes Nara _s_ a _m_\nsa when he is born.' Of course an expression like this is by no means\nsufficient to prove that the sacrificial gods Tanunapat and Nara _s_ a _m_ sa,\nas invoked in the \xc3\x82pri hymns, are nothing but forms of Agni. Expressions which\nare constantly repeated in the \xc3\x82pri verses show that the work of Tanunapat,\nand likewise that of Nara _s_ a _m_ sa, consisted in spreading gh _ri_ ta or\n'honey' over the sacrifice.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. 'Magnified' is i _li_ tah; comp. the note on I, 1, 1. The third, or if\nboth Tanunapat and Nara _s_ a _m_ sa are invoked, the fourth verse of the \xc3\x82pri\nhymns is regularly addressed to Agni with this epithet i _li_ ta.\n\np. 11\n\nNote 2. Manurhita, 'instituted by Manus,' not 'by men.' See Bergaigne,\nReligion Vedique, I, 6, 5 seq.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. On anushak, comp. Pischel, Vedische Studien, II, 125.\n\nNote 2. The last Pada is translated by Grassmann, 'wo der unsterbliche sich\nzeigt' (comp. Bergaigne, R.V. I, 194, note 1); by Ludwig, 'auf dem man das\nunsterbliche sieht.' To me it seems impossible to decide, so as to leave no\ndoubt, whether am _r i_tasya is masculine or neuter. Comp. also Atharva-veda\nV, 4, 3; 28, 7; XIX, 39, 6-8, in which passages the phrase am _r i_tasya _k_\naksha _n_ am recurs.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. The two divine Hot _ri_ s are mentioned in the Rig-veda only in the\neighth (or seventh) verse of the \xc3\x82prisuktas and besides in two passages, X,\n65, 10; 66, 13, which do not throw any light on the nature of these\nsacrificial gods. They are called _g_ atavedasa VII, 2, 7, purohitau X, 70, 7,\nbhisha _g_ a Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XXVIII, 7. As regards the duality of these\ndivine counterparts of the human Hot _ri_ priest, possibly the 'two Hot _ri_\ns' should be understood as the Hot _ri_ and the Maitravaru _n_ a; the latter\nwas the constant companion and assistant of the former in the Vedic animal\nsacrifice. Comp. Schwab, Altindisches Thieropfer, 96, 114, 117, &c.; H. O.,\nReligion des Veda, 391.\n\nComp. on the two divine Hot _ri_ s also Bergaigne, R.V. I, 233 seq.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. On I _l_ a, see H. O., Religion des Veda, pp. 72, 326.--With regard to\nMahi Bergaigne (Rel. Vedique, I, 322) has pronounced the opinion that 'Bharati\net Mahi, qui, tantot se remplacent, tantot se juxtaposent tout en paraissant\nne compter que pour une, se confondent aux yeux des _ri_ shis.' But Pischel\n(Ved. Studien, II, 84 seq.) has shown that the eminent French scholar was\nwrong, and that really Mahi ('the great one') is independent of Bharati.\nPischel's\n\np. 12\n\nown opinion that Mahi is a name of the goddess Dhisha _n_ a, does not seem to\nme to be established by sufficient reasons.--On the meaning of these three\ngoddesses Prof. Max Muller writes: 'I should not fix on Nourishment as the\ntrue meaning of I _l_ a. Originally those three goddesses seem to be local: I\n_l_ a, the land or daughter of Manu, the Sarasvati, and another river here\ncalled Mahi.'\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. To me it seems evident that the tree, or, to translate more literally,\nthe lord of the forest (vanaspati) invoked in this \xc3\x82pri verse can only be the\nsacrificial post (yupa) to which the victim was tied before it was killed. The\nyupa is called vanaspati in the Rig-veda (III, 8, t. 3. 6. ii) as well as in\nthe more modern Vedic texts (for inst., Taitt. Sa _m_ h. I, 3, 6, 1).--In the\n\xc3\x82pri hymn, IX, 5 (verse 10), the vanaspati is called sahasraval _s_ a: with\nthis should be compared III, 8, 11 (addressed to the yupa): vanaspate _s_\nataval _s_ a _h_ vi roha sahasraval _s_ a _h_ vi vayam ruhema, 'O lord of the\nforest, rise with a hundred offshoots; may we rise with a thousand offshoots!'\n--In the \xc3\x82pri hymn, X, 70 (verse 10), the rope (ra _s_ ana) is mentioned by\nwhich the vanaspati should tie the victim; comp. with this expression the\nstatements of the ritual texts as to the ra _s_ ana with which the victim is\ntied to the yupa; Schwab, Das Altindische Thieropfer, 8r. Comp. also\nespecially Taittiriya Brahma _n_ a III, 6, 11, 3.--In the \xc3\x82pri hymns the\nvanaspati is frequently invoked to let loose the victim; in connection\ntherewith mention is made of the sacrificial butcher ( _s_ amit _ri_ ), see\nII, 3, 10; III, 4, 10; X, 110, 10, and comp. Va _g_. Sa _m_ hita XXI, 21;\nXXVIII, 10. The meaning of these expressions becomes clear at once, if we\nexplain the vanaspati as the sacrificial post. When they are going to kill the\nvictim, they loosen it from the post; the post, therefore, can be said to let\nit loose. Then the butcher ( _s_ amit _ri_ ) leads the victim away. See the\nmaterials collected by Schwab, Thieropfer, p. 100 seq., and comp. also H. O.,\nReligion des Veda, 257.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 26](sbe46006.htm)\n\n"
