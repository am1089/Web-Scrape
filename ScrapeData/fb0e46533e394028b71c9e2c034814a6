But the separate (Brahman, i.e. the Brahman separate from the individual\nsouls) (is the creator); (the existence of which separate Brahman we learn)\nfrom the declaration of difference.\n\nThe word 'but' discards the purvapaksha.--We rather declare that that\nomniscient, omnipotent Brahman, whose essence is eternal pure cognition and\nfreedom, and which is additional to, i. e. different from the embodied Self,\nis the creative principle of the world. The faults specified above, such as\ndoing what is not beneficial, and the like, do not attach to that Brahman; for\nas eternal freedom is its characteristic nature, there is nothing either\nbeneficial to be done by it or non-beneficial to be avoided by it. Nor is\nthere any impediment to its knowledge and power; for it is omniscient and\nomnipotent. The embodied Self, on the other hand, is of a different nature,\nand to it the mentioned faults adhere. But then we do not declare it to be the\ncreator of the world, on account of 'the declaration of difference.' For\nscriptural passages (such as, 'Verily, the Self is to be seen, to be heard, to\nbe perceived, to be marked,' B _ri_. Up. II, 4, 5; 'The Self we must search\nout, we must try to understand,' _Kh_. Up. VIII, 7, 1; 'Then he becomes\n\np. 345\n\nunited with the True,' _Kh_. Up. VI, 8, 1; 'This embodied Self mounted by the\nintelligent Self,' B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 35) declare differences founded on the\nrelations of agent, object, and so on, and thereby show Brahman to be\ndifferent from the individual soul.--And if it be objected that there are\nother passages declaratory of non-difference (for instance, 'That art thou'),\nand that difference and non-difference cannot co-exist because contradictory,\nwe reply that the possibility of the co-existence of the two is shown by the\nparallel instance of the universal ether and the ether limited by a jar.--\nMoreover, as soon as, in consequence of the declaration of non-difference\ncontained in such passages as 'that art thou.' the consciousness of non-\ndifference arises in us, the transmigratory state of the individual soul and\nthe creative quality of Brahman vanish at once, the whole phenomenon of\nplurality, which springs from wrong knowledge, being sublated by perfect\nknowledge, and what becomes then of the creation and the faults of not doing\nwhat is beneficial, and the like? For that this entire apparent world, in\nwhich good and evil actions are done, &c., is a mere illusion, owing to the\nnon-discrimination of (the Self's) limiting adjuncts, viz. a body, and so on,\nwhich spring from name and form the presentations of Nescience, and does in\nreality not exist at all, we have explained more than once. The illusion is\nanalogous to the mistaken notion we entertain as to the dying, being born,\nbeing hurt, &c. of ourselves (our Selfs; while in reality the body only dies,\nis born, &c.). And with regard to the state in which the appearance of\nplurality is not yet sublated, it follows from passages declaratory of such\ndifference (as, for instance, 'That we must search for,' &c.) that Brahman is\nsuperior to the individual soul; whereby the possibility of faults adhering to\nit is excluded.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1, 23](sbe34162.htm)\n\n"
