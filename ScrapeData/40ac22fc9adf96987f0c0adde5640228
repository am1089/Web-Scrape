The Adhvaryu takes the sprinkling-water, and sprinkles in the first\nplace the fire-wood 1, with the\n\np. 84\n\ntext (Va _g_. S. II, 1), 'A black deer, living in the den, art thou 1; I\nsprinkle thee, agreeable to Agni!' He thereby makes it sacrificially pure for\nAgni.\n\n1:3:3:22\\. He then sprinkles he altar, with the text (Va _g_. S. II, 1), 'Thou\nart the altar; I sprinkle thee, agreeable to the barhis (sacrificial-grass\ncovering)!' He thereby makes it sacrificially pure for the grass covering.\n\n1:3:3:33\\. He (the \xc3\x82gnidhra) then hands the sacrificial grass 2 to him (the\nAdhvaryu). The latter puts it down (on the altar) with the knot turned to the\neast, and sprinkles it, with the text (Va _g_. S. II, I), 'Barhis art thou! I\nsprinkle thee, agreeable to the spoons!' He thereby makes it sacrificially\npure for the spoons.\n\n1:3:3:44\\. Thereupon he pours the sprinkling-water\n\np. 85\n\nwhich is left on the roots of the (grass) plants, with the text (Va _g_. S.\nII, 2), 'A moistening art thou for Aditi!' Aditi, indeed, is this earth; hence\nit is for the latter that he thus moistens the roots of the plants: thereby\nthese plants become root-moistened; and even if their tops are dry, their\nroots at least remain moist.\n\n1:3:3:55\\. Having thereupon untied the knot, he takes the prastara bunch from\nthe front (of the barhis), with the text (Va _g_. S. II, 2), 'Vish _n_ u's\ncrest art thou!' Vish _n_ u, namely, is the sacrifice, and this (the prastara)\nis his top-knot or crest: this he thereby makes it at this sacrifice 1. From\nthe front he takes it, because this top-knot also is (worn) on the front (of\nthe head): for this reason he takes it from the front.\n\n1:3:3:66\\. He then undoes the band (of the barhis). 'His (the sacrificer's)\nwife is sure to bring forth without difficulty 2,' thinking thus he undoes the\nband. He puts it down on the right hip (of the altar); for this represents his\n(the sacrificer's) waist-band, and it is on the right side that the waist-band\nis (tied): this is the reason why he puts it down on the right hip. He again\ncovers it over (with sacrificial grass); for the waist-band also is covered\n(by the upper garment): for this reason he again covers it.\n\n1:3:3:77\\. He now spreads the barhis (on the altar). For the prastara is the\ntop-knot; and this other\n\np. 86\n\nsacrificial grass is for this (sacrifice) what other hair there is below that\n(top-knot, viz. the beard, &c.):--that (hair) he thereby puts on it, and for\nthis reason he spreads the barhis.\n\n1:3:3:88\\. Now the altar (vedi, fem.) is a woman, and around her sit the gods\nand those priests who have studied and teach revealed lore 1; and as they thus\nsit around her, he makes her not naked: hence it is in order to avoid nudity\n(on her or the altar's part) that he spreads the barhis.\n\n1:3:3:99\\. As large as the altar is, so large is the earth; and the plants\n(are represented by) the barhis; so that he thereby furnishes the earth with\nplants; and those plants are firmly established in this earth: for this reason\nhe spreads the barhis.\n\n1:3:3:1010\\. Here now they say, 'Let him strew abundantly; for where the\nplants are most abundant on her, there the means of subsistence are most amply\nafforded by her: let him therefore strew abundantly!' It is in favour of him\n(the sacrificer) who procures (the sacrificial grass), then, (that this is\ndone.) He strews it threefold 2, for threefold is the sacrifice. Or he may\nalso spread it whilst lifting up (the tops) 3; for\n\np. 87\n\nit has been said by the seer (Va _g_. S. VII, 32), 'They spread the barhis\ncontinuously.' He spreads it with the roots below (the tops); for it is with\ntheir roots below that those plants are firmly established in this earth: for\nthis reason he spreads it with the roots below.\n\n1:3:3:1111\\. He spreads it, with the text (Va _g_. S. II, 2), 'I spread thee,\nsoft as wool, pleasant to sit upon for the gods!'--when he says 'thee, soft as\nwool,' he thereby means to say 'agreeable to the gods;' and by 'pleasant to\nsit upon for the gods,' he means to say 'forming a good seat for the gods.'\n\n1:3:3:1212\\. He now trims the fire 1. The \xc3\x82havaniya, doubtless, is the head of\nthe sacrifice, for the head is the fore-part 2: that fore-part of the\nsacrifice he thereby trims. He trims it while holding the prastara (which he\nhas received back from the Brahman) close over it; for the prastara is the\ntop-knot, and it is this which he thereby puts on it: for this reason he trims\n(the fire) while holding the prastara close over it.\n\n1:3:3:1313\\. He then lays the (three) enclosing-sticks (paridhi) around (the\nfire). The reason why he lays the enclosing-sticks around (is this). When at\nfirst the gods chose Agni for the office of Hot _ri_ , he said: 'Verily, I am\nnot equal to this, that I should be your Hot _ri_ , and that I should carry\nyour oblation. Already you have chosen three before,\n\np. 88\n\nand they have passed away 1. Restore them to me: then I shall be equal to\nthis, that I should be your Hot _ri_ and that I should carry your oblation!'\nThey said, 'So be it!' and they restored to him those (three former Agnis):\nthey are these enclosing-sticks.\n\n1:3:3:1414\\. He then said, 'The thunderbolt, (in the shape of) the vasha _t_\n-call 2, has struck these down: I am afraid of that thunderbolt, the vasha _t_\n-call. Lest that thunderbolt, the vasha _t_ -call, should strike me down,\nenclose me by those (three Agnis, or paridhis); and thus that thunderbolt, the\nvasha _t_ -call, will not strike me down.' They said, 'So be it!' and they\nenclosed him with those (three sticks), and that thunderbolt, the vasha _t_\ncall, did not strike him down. When he encloses Agni with those (sticks) he\nbuckles armour on him.\n\n1:3:3:1515\\. They (the other three Agnis) then said, 'If you join us with the\nsacrifice in this wise, then let us also have a share in the sacrifice!'\n\n1:3:3:1616\\. The gods said: 'So be it! What shall fall outside the enclosure,\nthat is offered unto you; and what they shall offer just upon you, that will\nsate\n\np. 89\n\nyou; and what they shall offer up in the fire that will sate you!' Thus what\nthey offer up in the fire, that satisfies them (the Agnis); and what they\noffer up just upon them (the enclosing-sticks, or Agnis), that satisfies them;\nand what is spilled outside the enclosure, that is offered to them 1: hence no\nsin attaches to what (butter) is spilt; for into this earth they entered (when\nthey, the Agnis, passed away), and whatever is spilt here,--all that remains\nindeed in her.\n\n1:3:3:1717\\. That which is spilt he touches, with the formulas (Va _g_. S. II,\n2), 'To the Lord of the Earth--svaha!' 'To the Lord of the World--svaha!' 'To\nthe Lord of Beings--svaha!' These, indeed, are the names of those Agnis,--to\nwit, Lord of the Earth, Lord of the World, and Lord of Beings. Thus in like\nmanner as that (oblation) which is accompanied by 'Vasha _t_ ' is offered up\n(to the particular deity to which it is announced), so is this (offered up) on\nhis (the sacrificer's) part to those Agnis.\n\n1:3:3:1818\\. Here now some people take the sticks they lay around from the\nfire-wood; but let him not do so, for unsuitable for laying around are those\nwhich they take from the fire-wood, since the fire-wood is prepared for the\npurpose of being put upon (the fire); but what other (kind of sticks) they\nbring to him, called 'enclosing-sticks (paridhis),' they are indeed suitable\nfor his purpose: let them therefore bring others.\n\n1:3:3:1919\\. Indeed, they should be of Pala _s_ a wood\n\np. 90\n\n[paragraph continues] (Butea Frondosa); for the Pala _s_ a tree, doubtless, is\nthe Brahman [1](sbe1215.htm#fn_256), and Agni also is the Brahman: for this\nreason the Agnis should be of Pala _s_ a wood.\n\n1:3:3:2020\\. Should he be unable to procure them of Pala _s_ a wood, they may\nbe of Vikankata wood (Flacourtia Sapida); and if he be unable to procure any\nof Vikankata, they may be of Karshmarya wood (Gmelina Arborea); and if he be\nunable to procure any of Karshmarya wood, they may be of Vilva (Aegle\nMarmelos), or of Khadira (Acacia Catechu), or of Udumbara wood (Ficus\nGlomerata). These, doubtless, are the trees that are suitable for sacrificial\npurposes, and from these trees they (the enclosing-sticks) are therefore\n(taken).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[83:1](sbe1214.htm#fr_244) The fire-wood had been brought by the \xc3\x82gnidhra and\nlaid down on the altar. The Adhvaryu now unties and sprinkles it. [Before\ndoing so he has, as usual, to ask and obtain the permission of the Brahman.\nThe same is the case in regard to the barhis, but not in regard to the altar.]\nKaty. II, 7, 19.\n\n[84:1](sbe1214.htm#fr_245) ? \xc3\x82khare-sh _th_ a; it probably has a double\nmeaning in this place, viz. 'that which dwells in a den (akhara)' and 'that\nwhich has its place on the hearth (khara).'\n\n[84:2](sbe1214.htm#fr_246) 'At the beginning of the sacrifice the Adhvaryu\nmakes of the load of Darbha or sacred grass, which has been brought to the\nsacrificial compound, seven mush _t_ is or bunches, each of which is tied\ntogether with a stalk of grass, just as the Baresma (Barsom) of the Parsis.\nThe several names of these seven bunches are, 1. Va _g_ amanamush _t_ i, the\nbunch kept by the sacrificer himself in his hand as long as the sacrifice\nlasts. 2. Three bunches from the Barhis, or the covering of the Vedi on which\nthe sacrificial vessels are put. These are unloosened and spread all over the\nVedi. 3. Prastara. This bunch, which must remain tied, is put over the Darbha\nof the Vedi. 4. Paribho _g_ ani. From this bunch the Adhvaryu takes a handful\nout for each priest, and the sacrificer and his wife, which they then use for\ntheir seat. 5. The Veda. This bunch is made double in its first part; the\nlatter part is cut off and has to remain on the Vedi; it is called parivasana.\nThe Veda itself is always wandering from one priest to the other, and is given\nto the sacrificer and his wife. It is handed over to the latter only when one\nof the priests makes her recite a mantra.' Haug's translation of the Ait. Br.\np. 79.\n\n[85:1](sbe1214.htm#fr_247) Because, according to Saya _n_ a, it lies on the\nfront, or eastern side of the altar, near the \xc3\x82havaniya fire, and men also\nwear their topknot (in the form of a ball or lump) on the fore-part of their\nhead. The prastara he hands to the Brahman-priest. Katy. II, 7, 22.\n\n[85:2](sbe1214.htm#fr_248) Prak _li_ ptam; Saya _n_ a takes it in the sense of\n'a completely formed (child).'\n\n[86:1](sbe1214.htm#fr_249) 'Around her on the south sit the gods and those\nman-gods (manushyadeva _h_ ), the priests who have studied and teach revealed\nlore.' Ka _n_ va recension.\n\n[86:2](sbe1214.htm#fr_250) Viz. in three layers, one beside the other, each\nconsisting of one handful of grass. He first spreads a layer on the east side\nfrom the southern to the northern shoulder of the altar, with the tops of the\nblades turned towards the east; then a second one west of it, so as to cover\nthe roots of the first with the tops of the second layer; and in the same way\na third one on the west side of the altar. If he thinks fit, he may make more\nthan three layers, but their number should be uneven. Katy. II, 7, 22-26\n(schol.).\n\n[86:3](sbe1214.htm#fr_251) That is to say, he is to begin on the west side,\nand in laying down the successive layers, he is to lift up (with a stick or\nsome p. 87 other object) the heads of the preceding layer and push the roots\nof the succeeding one under them. Ib. 27 (schol.).\n\n[87:1](sbe1214.htm#fr_252) He takes one stick from the fuel and gets the fire\nready (for the oblations, either by throwing the stick into it, or by stirring\nit with the stick). Ib. 29.\n\n[87:2](sbe1214.htm#fr_253) The \xc3\x82havaniya is at the foremost or eastern end of\nthe sacrificial ground.\n\n[88:1](sbe1214.htm#fr_254) See I, 2, 3, 1.\n\n[88:2](sbe1214.htm#fr_255) The call 'vasha _t_ ' (or vausha _t_ ), apparently\nsignifying 'may he (Agni) carry it (the oblation) up!' (from vah, to bear,\ncarry), is pronounced by the Hot _ri_ at the end of the yagyas or offering\nprayers (see note on I, 5, 1, 16). Professor Weber has somewhere proposed to\nderive it from vaksh, to grow, increase, hence 'may it prosper, or agree, with\nyou!' Different, but quite fanciful, interpretations of vasha _t_ are given\n_S_ at. Br. I, 5, 2, 18; Ait. Br. 3, 6. As to the awful solemnity of this\nformula, and the danger arising from a careless use of it, see Ait. Br. 3, 8,\non which Haug remarks, 'Up to the present day the Shrotriyas or sacrificial\npriests never dare to pronounce this formula save at the time of sacrificing.\nThey say that if they would do so at any other time, they would be cursed by\nthe gods.'\n\n[89:1](sbe1214.htm#fr_256) The Ka _n_ va text has as follows:--They said, 'So\nbe it! what shall fall outside the enclosure that shall be yours! and what\nthey shall offer just upon you that shall sate you!' for what they offer just\nupon them that does indeed sate them (enan); and what they offer up in the\nfire that is theirs (esham, ? the gods'); and what falls outside the enclosure\nby that he shall incur no guilt, &c.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 4.
