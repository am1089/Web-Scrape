And as in the case of the different vital airs.\n\nIt is a matter of observation that when the operations of the different kinds\nof vital air--such as pra _n_ a the ascending vital air, apana the descending\nvital air, &c.--are suspended, in consequence of the breath being held so that\nthey exist in their causes merely, the only effect which continues to be\naccomplished is life, while all other effects, such as the bending and\nstretching of the limbs and so on, are stopped. When, thereupon, the vital\nairs again begin to act, those other effects also are brought about, in\naddition to mere life.--Nor must the vital airs, on account of their being\ndivided into classes, be considered as something else than vital air; for wind\n(air) constitutes their common character. Thus (i. e. in the manner\nillustrated by the instance of the vital airs) the non-difference of the\neffect from the cause is to be conceived.--As, therefore, the whole world is\nan effect of Brahman and\n\np. 343\n\nnon-different from it, the promise held out in the scriptural passage that\n'What is not heard is heard, what is not perceived is perceived, what is not\nknown is known' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 1, 3) is fulfilled  1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[343:1](sbe34159.htm#fr_305) Because it has been shown that cause and effect\nare identical; hence if the cause is known, the effect is known also.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1, 21](sbe34160.htm)\n\n"
