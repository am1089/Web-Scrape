From him (i.e. the Lord, there comes) the fruit (of works); for (that\nonly) is possible.\n\nWe now turn to another characteristic belonging to Brahman, in so far as it is\nconnected with the every-day world in which we distinguish a ruler and the\nobjects of his rule.--There arises the question whether the threefold fruits\nof action which are enjoyed by the creatures in their\n\np. 181\n\nsa _m_ sara-state--viz. pain, pleasure, and a mixture of the two-spring from\nthe actions themselves or come from the Lord.--The Sutrakara embraces the\nlatter alternative, on the ground that it is the only possible one. The ruler\nof all who by turns provides for the creation, the subsistence and the\nreabsorption of the world, and who knows all the differences of place and\ntime, he alone is capable of effecting all those modes of requital which are\nin accordance with the merit of the agents; actions, on the other hand, which\npass away as soon as done, have no power of bringing about results at some\nfuture time, since nothing can spring from nothing. Nor can the latter\ndifficulty be overcome by the assumption that an action passes away only after\nhaving produced some result according to its nature, and that the agent will\nat some future time enjoy that fruit of his action. For the fruit of an action\nis such only through being enjoyed by the agent; only at the moment when some\npleasure or some pain--the result of some deed--is enjoyed by the doer of the\ndeed people understand it to be a 'fruit.'--Nor in the second place. have we\nthe right to assume that the fruit will, at some future time, spring from the\nso-called supersensuous principle (apurva), which itself is supposed to be a\ndirect result of the deed; for that so-called supersensuous principle is\nsomething of non-intelligent nature, comparable to a piece of wood or metal,\nand as such cannot act unless moved by some intelligent being. And moreover\nthere is no proof whatever for the existence of such an apurva.--But is it not\nproved by the fact that deeds are actually requited?--By no means, we reply;\nfor the fact of requital may be accounted for by the action of the Lord.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2, 39](sbe38142.htm)\n\n"
