Om! O Bhagavad-Gita, with which Partha was enlightened by the Lord\nNarayana Himself and which was incorporated in the Mahabharata by the ancient\nsage Vyasa,--the Blessed Mother, the Destroyer of rebirth, showering down the\nnectar of Advaita, and consisting of\n\np. vi\n\neighteen chapters,--upon Thee, O Bhagavad-Gita! O Loving Mother! I meditate.\n\n2\\. Salutation to thee, O Vyasa, of mighty intellect and with eyes large like\nthe petals of full-blown lotuses, by whom was lighted the lamp of wisdom, full\nof the Mahabharata-oil.\n\np. vii\n\n3\\. Salutation to Krishna, the holder of the Jnanamudra, granter of desires of\nthose who take refuge in Him, the milker of the Gita-nectar, in whose hand is\nthe cane for driving cows.\n\n4\\. All the Upanishads are the cows, the Son of the cowherd is the milker,\nPartha is the calf, men of purified intellect are the drinkers and the supreme\nnectar Gita is the milk.\n\np. viii\n\n5\\. I salute Krishna, the Guru of the Universe, God, the son of Vasudeva, the\nDestroyer of Karma and Chanura, the supreme bliss of Devaki.\n\n6\\. The battle-river, with Bhishma and Drona as its banks, and Jayadratha as\nthe water, with the king of Gandhara as the blue water-lily, and Shalya as the\nshark, with Kripa as the current and\n\np. ix\n\n[paragraph continues] Karna as the breakers, with Ashvatthama and Vikarna as\nterrible Makaras and Duryodhana as the whirlpool in it,--was indeed crossed\nover by the Pandavas, with Keshava as the ferry-man.\n\n7\\. May the taintless lotus of the Mahabharata, growing on the waters of the\nwords of Parashara's son, having the\n\np. x\n\n[paragraph continues] Gita as its strong sweet fragrance, with many a\nnarrative as its stamens, fully opened by the discourses on Hari and drunk\njoyously day after day by the Bhramara of the good and the pure in the world,\n--be productive of the supreme good to him who is eager to destroy the taint\nof Kali!\n\n8\\. I salute that All-bliss Madhava whose compassion makes the mute eloquent\nand the cripple cross mountains.\n\np. xi\n\n9\\. Salutation to that God Whom the creator Brahma, Varuna, Indra, Rudra and\nthe Maruts praise with divine hymns; Whom the singers of Sama sing, by the\nVedas, with their full complement of parts, consecutive sections and\nUpanishads; Whom the Yogis see with their minds absorbed in Him through\nperfection in meditation, and Whose limit the hosts of Devas and Asuras know\nnot.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Invocation](sbg05.htm)\n\n"
