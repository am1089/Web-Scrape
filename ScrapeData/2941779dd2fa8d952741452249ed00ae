Some texts declare a\ndistinction of nature between non-intelligent matter, intelligent beings, and\nBrahman, in so far as matter is the object of enjoyment, the souls the\nenjoying subjects, and Brahman the ruling principle. 'From that the Lord of\nMaya creates all this; in that the other\n\np. 139\n\none is bound up through that Maya' ( _S_ vet. Up. IV, 9); 'Know Prak _ri_ ti\nto be Maya, and the great Lord the ruler of Maya' (10); 'What is perishable is\nthe Pradhana, the immortal and imperishable is Hara: the one God rules the\nPerishable and the Self' ( _S_ vet Up. I, 10)--In this last passage the\nclause'the immortal and imperishable is Hara,' refers to the enjoying\nindividual soul, which is called 'Hara,' because it draws (harati) towards\nitself the pradhana as the object of its enjoyment.--' He is the cause, the\nlord of the lords of the organs, and there is of him neither parent nor lord'\n( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 9); 'The master of the pradhana and of the individual\nsouls' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 16); 'The ruler of all, the lord of the Selfs, the\neternal, blessed, undecaying one' (Mahanar. Up. XI, 3); 'There are two unborn\nones, one knowing, the other not knowing, one a ruler, the other not a ruler'\n( _S_ vet. Up. 1, 9); 'The eternal among the non-eternal, the intelligent one\namong the intelligent, who though one fulfils the desires of many' ( _S_ vet.\nUp. VI, 13); 'Knowing the enjoyer, the object of enjoyment and the Mover' (\n_S_ vet. Up. I, 12); 'One of them eats the sweet fruit, the other looks on\nwithout eating' ( _S_ vet. Up. IV, 6); 'Thinking that the Self is different\nfrom the Mover, blessed by him he reaches Immortality' ( _S_ vet. Up. I, 6);\n'There is one unborn female being, red, white, and black, uniform but\nproducing manifold offspring. There is one unborn male being who loves her and\nlies by her; there is another who leaves her after he has enjoyed her' ( _S_\nvet. Up. IV, 5). 'On the same tree man, immersed, bewildered, grieves on\naccount of his impotence; but when he sees the other Lord contented and knows\nhis glory, then his grief passes away' ( _S_ vet. Up. IV, 9).--Sm _ri_ ti\nexpresses itself similarly.--'Thus eightfold is my nature divided. Lower is\nthis Nature; other than this and higher know that Nature of mine which\nconstitutes the individual soul, by which this world is supported' (Bha. Gi.\nVII, 4, 5). 'All beings at the end of a Kalpa return into my Nature, and again\nat the beginning of a Kalpa do I send them forth. Resting on my own Nature\nagain and again do I send forth this entire body of beings, which has no power\nof its own.\n\np. 140\n\nbeing subject to the power of nature' (Bha. Gi. IX, 7, 8); 'With me as\nsupervisor Nature brings forth the movable and the immovable, and for this\nreason the world ever moves round' (Bha. Gi. IX, 10}; 'Know thou both Nature\nand the Soul to be without beginning' (XIII, 19); 'The great Brahman is my\nwomb, in which I place the embryo, and thence there is the origin of all\nbeings' (XIV, 3). This last passage means--the womb of the world is the great\nBrahman, i.e. non-intelligent matter in its subtle state, commonly called Prak\n_ri_ ti; with this I connect the embryo, i.e. the intelligent principle. From\nthis contact of the non-intelligent and the intelligent, due to my will, there\nensues the origination of all beings from gods down to lifeless things.\n\nNon-intelligent matter and intelligent beings--holding the relative positions\nof objects of enjoyment and enjoying subjects, and appearing in multifarious\nforms--other scriptural texts declare to be permanently connected with the\nhighest Person in so far as they constitute his body, and thus are controlled\nby him; the highest Person thus constituting their Self. Compare the following\npassages: 'He who dwells in the earth and within the earth, whom the earth\ndoes not know, whose body the earth is, and who rules the earth within, he is\nthy Self, the ruler within, the immortal,' &c. (B _ri_. Up. III, 7, 3-23); 'He\nwho moves within the earth, whose body the earth is, &c.; he who moves within\ndeath, whose body death is,' &c.(Subala Up. VII, 1). In this latter passage\nthe word 'death' denotes what is also called 'darkness,' viz. non-intelligent\nmatter in its subtle state; as appears from another passage in the same\nUpanishad,'the Imperishable is merged in darkness.' And compare also 'Entered\nwithin, the ruler of creatures, the Self of all' (Taitt. \xc3\x82r. III, 24).\n\nOther texts, again, aim at teaching that the highest Self to whom non-\nintelligent and intelligent beings stand in the relation of body, and hence of\nmodes, subsists in the form of the world, in its causal as well as in its\neffected aspect, and hence speak of the world in this its double aspect as\nthat which is (the Real); so e.g. 'Being only this was in the beginning, one\nonly without a second--it desired, may\n\np. 141\n\n[paragraph continues] I be many, may I grow forth--it sent forth fire,' &c.,\nup to 'all these creatures have their root in that which is,' &c., up to 'that\nart thou, O _S_ vetaketu' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 2-8); 'He wished, may I be many,'\n&c., up to 'it became the true and the untrue' (Taitt. Up. II, 6). These\nsections also refer to the essential distinction of nature between non-\nintelligent matter, intelligent beings, and the highest Self which is\nestablished by other scriptural texts; so in the _Kh_ andogya passage, 'Let me\nenter those three divine beings with this living Self, and let me then evolve\nnames and forms'; and in the Taitt. passage, 'Having sent forth that he\nentered into it; having entered it he became sat and tyat, knowledge and (what\nis) without knowledge, the true and the untrue,' &c. These two passages\nevidently have the same purport, and hence the soul's having its Self in\nBrahman--which view is implied in the _Kh._ passage--must be understood as\nresting thereon that the souls (together, with matter) constitute the body of\nBrahman as asserted in the Taitt. passage ('it became knowledge and that which\nis without knowledge,' i.e. souls and matter). The same process of evolution\nof names and forms is described elsewhere also, 'All this was then unevolved;\nit became evolved by form and name' (B _ri_. Up. I, 4, 7). The fact is that\nthe highest Self is in its causal or in its 'effected' condition, according as\nit has for its body intelligent and non-intelligent beings either in their\nsubtle or their gross state; the effect, then, being non-different from the\ncause, and hence being cognised through the cognition of the cause, the result\nis that the desired 'cognition of all things through one' can on our view be\nwell established. In the clause 'I will enter into these three divine beings\nwith this living Self,' &c., the term 'the three divine beings' denotes the\nentire aggregate of non-sentient matter, and as the text declares that the\nhighest Self evolved names and forms by entering into matter by means of the\nliving souls of which he is the Self, it follows that all terms whatsoever\ndenote the highest Self as qualified by individual Selfs, the latter again\nbeing qualified by non-sentient matter. A term which denotes\n\np. 142\n\nthe highest Self in its causal condition may therefore be exhibited in co-\nordination with another term denoting the highest Self in its 'effected'\nstate, both terms being used in their primary senses. Brahman, having for its\nmodes intelligent and non-intelligent things in their gross and subtle states,\nthus constitutes effect and cause, and the world thus has Brahman for its\nmaterial cause (upadana). Nor does this give rise to any confusion of the\nessential constituent elements of the great aggregate of things. Of some\nparti-coloured piece of cloth the material cause is threads white, red, black,\n&c.; all the same, each definite spot of the cloth is connected with one\ncolour only white e.g., and thus there is no confusion of colours even in the\n'effected' condition of the cloth. Analogously the combination of non-sentient\nmatter, sentient beings, and the Lord constitutes the material cause of the\nworld, but this does not imply any confusion of the essential characteristics\nof enjoying souls, objects of enjoyment, and the universal ruler, even in the\nworld's 'effected' state. There is indeed a difference between the two cases,\nin so far as the threads are capable of existing apart from one another, and\nare only occasionally combined according to the volition of men, so that the\nweb sometimes exists in its causal, sometimes in its effected state; while\nnon-sentient matter and sentient beings in all their states form the body of\nthe highest Self, and thus have a being only as the modes of that--on which\naccount the highest Self may, in all cases, be denoted by any term whatsoever.\nBut the two cases are analogous, in so far as there persists a distinction and\nabsence of all confusion, on the part of the constituent elements of the\naggregate. This being thus, it follows that the highest Brahman, although\nentering into the 'effected' condition, remains unchanged--for its essential\nnature does not become different--and we also understand what constitutes its\n'effected' condition, viz. its abiding as the Self of non-intelligent and\nintelligent beings in their gross condition, distinguished by name and form.\nFor becoming an effect means entering into another state of being.\n\nThose texts, again, which speak of Brahman as devoid of\n\np. 143\n\nqualities, explain themselves on the ground of Brahman being free from all\ntouch of evil. For the passage, _Kh_. Up. VIII, 1, 5--which at first negatives\nall evil qualities 'free from sin, from old age, from death, from grief, from\nhunger and thirst', and after that affirms auspicious qualities 'whose wishes\nand purposes come true'--enables us to decide that in other places also the\ngeneral denial of qualities really refers to evil qualities only.--Passages\nwhich declare knowledge to constitute the essential nature of Brahman explain\nthemselves on the ground that of Brahman--which is all-knowing, all-powerful,\nantagonistic to all evil, a mass of auspicious qualities--the essential nature\ncan be defined as knowledge (intelligence) only--which also follows from the\n'self-luminousness' predicated of it. Texts, on the other hand, such as 'He\nwho is all-knowing' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 9); 'His high power is revealed as\nmanifold, as essential, acting as force and knowledge' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 8);;\n'Whereby should he know the knower' (B _ri_. Up. II, 4, 14), teach the highest\nSelf to be a knowing subject. Other texts, again, such as 'The True,\nknowledge, infinite is Brahman' (Taitt. Up. II, 1, 1), declare knowledge to\nconstitute its nature, as it can be denned through knowledge only, and is\nself-luminous. And texts such as 'He desired, may I be many' (Taitt. Up. II,\n6); 'It thought, may I be many; it evolved itself through name and form' (\n_Kh_. Up. VI, 2), teach that Brahman, through its mere wish, appears in\nmanifold modes. Other texts, again, negative the opposite view, viz. that\nthere is a plurality of things not having their Self in Brahman. 'From death\nto death goes he who sees here any plurality'; 'There is here not any\nplurality' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 19); 'For where there is duality as it were' (B\n_ri_. Up. II, 4, 14). But these texts in no way negative that plurality of\nmodes--declared in passages such as 'May I be many, may I 'grow forth'--which\nsprings from Brahman's will, and appears in the distinction of names and\nforms. This is proved by clauses in those 'negativing' texts themselves,\n'Whosoever looks for anything elsewhere than in the Self', 'from that great\nBeing there has been breathed forth the _Ri_ g-veda,' &c. (B _ri_. Up. II, 4,\n6, 10).--\n\np. 144\n\n[paragraph continues] On this method of interpretation we find that the texts\ndeclaring the essential distinction and separation of non-sentient matter,\nsentient beings, and the Lord, and those declaring him to be the cause and the\nworld to be the effect, and cause and effect to be identical, do not in any\nway conflict with other texts declaring that matter and souls form the body of\nthe Lord, and that matter and souls in their causal condition are in a subtle\nstate, not admitting of the distinction of names and forms while in their\n'effected' gross state they are subject to that distinction. On the other\nhand, we do not see how there is any opening for theories maintaining the\nconnexion of Brahman with Nescience, or distinctions in Brahman due to\nlimiting adjuncts (upadhi)--such and similar doctrines rest on fallacious\nreasoning, and flatly contradict Scripture.\n\nThere is nothing contradictory in allowing that certain texts declare the\nessential distinction of matter, souls, and the Lord, and their mutual\nrelation as modes and that to which the modes belong, and that other texts\nagain represent them as standing in the relation of cause and effect, and\nteach cause and effect to be one. We may illustrate this by an analogous case\nfrom the Karmaka _nd_ a. There six separate oblations to Agni, and so on, are\nenjoined by separate so-called originative injunctions; these are thereupon\ncombined into two groups (viz. the new moon and the full-moon sacrifices) by a\ndouble clause referring to those groups, and finally a so-called injunction of\nqualification enjoins the entire sacrifice as something to be performed by\npersons entertaining a certain wish. In a similar way certain Vedanta-texts\ngive instruction about matter, souls, and the Lord as separate entities\n('Perishable is the pradhana, imperishable and immortal Hara,' &c., _S_ vet\nUp. I, 10; and others); then other texts teach that matter and souls in all\ntheir different states constitute tbc body of the highest Person, while the\nlatter is their Self ('Whose body the earth is,' &c.); and finally another\ngroup of texts teaches--by means of words such as 'Being,' 'Brahman,' 'Self,'\ndenoting the highest Self to which the body belongs--that the one highest Self\nin its causal and\n\np. 145\n\neffected states comprises within itself the triad of entities which had been\ntaught in separation ('Being only this was in the beginning'; 'In that all\nthis has its Self; 'All this is Brahman').--That the highest Self with matter\nand souls for its body should be simply called the highest Self, is no more\nobjectionable than that that particular form of Self which is invested with a\nhuman body should simply be spoken of as Self or soul--as when we say 'This is\na happy soul.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Nescience cannot be terminated by the simple act of cognising Brahman\nas the universal self](sbe48033.htm)\n\n"
