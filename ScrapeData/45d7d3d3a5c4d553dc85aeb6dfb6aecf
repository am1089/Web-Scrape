He offers with (an oblation)\nladled up four times, cattle have four feet; verily he wins cattle; the\nquarters are four; verily he finds support in the quarters. The metres\ndeparted from the gods (saying), 'We will not carry your oblation without\nsharing (in it)'; for them they kept this (oblation) ladled up four times, for\nthe Puronuvakya the Yajya, the deity, the Vasat call; in that he offers what\nhas been ladled up four times, he delights the metres, and they delighted\ncarry to the gods his oblation. If he desire of a man [1], 'May he become\nworse', he should offer each separately for him; verily he makes him severed\nfrom the libations; he becomes worse. If he desire of a man, 'May he become\nbetter', he should offer all for him continuously; verily he makes him master\nof the libation; he becomes better. This is the mastering of the sacrifice. He\nabandons prosperity in the beginning of the sacrifice who departs from Agni as\nthe deity; these offerings to Savitr number eight, the Gayatri has eight\nsyllables, Agni is connected with the Gayatri [2]; verily he does not abandon\nprosperity at the beginning of the sacrifice, nor Agni as the deity. The\nofferings to Savitr number eight, the libation (as a whole) is the ninth;\nverily he extends the threefold (Stoma) at the beginning of the sacrifice. If\nhe desire, 'May I confer on the metres the glory of the sacrifice', he should\nmake a Re verse last; verily he confers on the metres the glory of the\nsacrifice. If he desire, 'May I confer on the sacrificer the glory of the\nsacrifice', he should make a Yajus formula last; verily he confers on the\nsacrificer the glory of the sacrifice. 'By the Rc make the Stoma to flourish',\nhe says [3], for prosperity. With four (verses) he takes up the spade; the\nmetres are four; verily (he takes it up) with the metres. 'On the instigation\nof god Savitr', he says, for instigation. Agni went away from the gods, he\nentered the reed; he resorted to the hole which is formed by the perforation\nof the reed; the spade is perforated to make it his birthplace; wherever he\nlived, that became black; (the spade) is stained, for perfection of form; it\nis pointed at both ends, for the winning of light both hence and from yonder\nworld; it is a fathom long; so much is the strength in man; (verily it is)\ncommensurate with his strength; it is unlimited in girth, to win what is\nunlimited; that tree which has fruit is strong among trees, the reed bears\nfruit, (the spade) is of reed, to win strength.\n\n### v. 1. 2.\n\nThat part of the sacrifice is unsuccessful which is performed with no Yajus.\n'This bond of order they grasped', (with these words) he takes up the horse's\nhalter, to make a Yajus and to make successful the sacrifice. 'Swiftly run\nhither, O steed', (with these words) he halters the horse; verily he proclaims\nits greatness in this form. 'Yoke ye the ass', (with these words) (he halters)\nthe ass; verily he establishes the ass on the non-existent; therefore the ass\nis less real than the horse. 'In each need more strong', he says [1]; verily\nin each need he yokes him; 'in each contest we invoke', he says; the contest\nis food; verily he wins food. 'As friends, Indra to aid us', he says; verily\nhe wins power. Agni went away from the gods, him Prajapati found; the horse is\nconnected with Prajapati, with the horse he collects (it), for the finding (of\nAgni). Now confusion occurs in that they perform the same thing with a better\nand worse (instrument), for the ass is worse than the horse [2]; they lead the\nhorse in front to avoid confusion; therefore the worse follows after the\nbetter. Many are the foes of the man who waxes great, he waxes great as it\nwere who piles the fire, the steed has a thunderbolt; 'hastening come hither,\ntrampling the enemy', he says; verily he tramples with the thunderbolt on the\nevil foe; 'from the lordship of Rudra', he says; cattle are connected with\nRudra; verily having begged from Rudra [3] cattle he acts for his own\ninterest. 'With Pusan as fellow', he says; Pusan is the leader together of\nroads; (verily it serves) for attainment. The fire has dust for its abode; the\nAngirases brought it together before the deities; 'from the abode of earth do\nthou approach Agni of the dust in the mode of Angiras', he says; verily he\nbrings it together in one abode with the deities. 'We approach Agni of the\ndust in the manner of Angiras', he says; verily he appropriates the strength\nof him whom he meets [4]. 'The fire should be brought together after\nannouncing it to Prajapati', they say; Prajapati is this earth, the ant-heap\nis its ear; 'we will bear Agni of the dust in the manner of Angiras', (with\nthese words) he pays reverence to the mound of an ant-heap; verily after\nannouncing it to Prajapati face to face, he brings together the fire. 'We bear\nAgni of the dust in the manner of Angiras', he says; verily he appropriates\nthe strength of him whom he meets. 'Agni hath gazed along the forefront of the\ndawns' [5], he says, to light up (the heaven). 'The steed coming, from the\nway', 'Coming to earth, O steed', he says; verily he wishes for it with the\nfirst and obtains it with the second; with two (verses) he makes it come, for\nsupport; (with two) of the same form, therefore cattle are born of the same\nform. 'Thy back is the sky, thy abode earth', he says; Prajapati quickened him\nfrom these worlds; verily he proclaims its greatness in this form. The steed\nis possessed of the thunderbolt, by its incisors it is more puissant than\nthose with one row of incisors, by its hair than those with two rows; him whom\nhe hates he should conceive as beneath its feet; verily with the thunderbolt\nhe lays him low.\n\n### v. 1. 3.\n\n'The strong steed hath stepped forth', with these two (verses) he makes it\nstep forth; (with two) of the same form, therefore cattle are born of the same\nform. He pours water down; where there are waters, there Plants take root, and\nwhere plants take root cattle find support through them, the sacrifice (finds\nsupport) in cattle, the sacrificer in the sacrifice, offspring in the\nsacrificer; therefore he pours water down, for support. If the Adhvaryu were\nto pour the libation on that which is without fire, the Adhvaryu would be [1]\nblind, the Raksases would destroy the sacrifice; he puts gold down and offers;\nverily he pours on what has fire, the Adhvaryu does not become blind, the\nRaksases do not destroy the sacrifice. 'I touch Agni with mind, with ghee', he\nsays, for with mind man approaches the sacrifice; 'who lordeth it over all the\nworlds', he says, for he lords it over all; 'broad, vast, with pervading vital\npower', he says, for he born small becomes great [2]; 'most extensive,\nimpetuous, winning food', he says; verily he makes pleasant food for him; all\nis pleasant for him who knows thus. 'I touch thee with speech, with ghee', he\nsays; therefore what a man conceives with mind he utters with speech; 'with\nfriendly (mind) he says, to smite away the Raksases; 'with mortal glory, with\nengaging colour, Agni', he says; verily he bestows beauty upon him; he is\npossessed of beauty who knows thus [3]. By mind must he obtain that libation\nwhich the Adhvaryu offers in that which is without fire; he offers with two\nverses containing the word 'mind', to obtain the two libations; with two (he\noffers), for support. As the beginning of the sacrifice is performed the\nRaksases are fain to destroy the sacrifice; now then is this (place) the\nbeginning of the sacrifice when the libation comes upon it; he draws a line\naround, to smite away the Raksases; with three (verses) he draws a line\naround, Agni is threefold; verily from the whole extent of Agni he smites away\nthe Raksases [4]; with a Gayatri verse he draws a line around, the Gayatri is\nbrilliance; verily with brilliance, he encircles him; with a Tristubh verse he\ndraws a line around, the Tristubh is power; verily he encircles him with\npower; with an Anustubh verse he draws a line around, the Anustubh, envelops\nall the metres, (verily it serves) for complete attainment; with the Anustubh\nin the middle (he draws), the Anustubh is speech, therefore from the middle we\nspeak with speech; with the Gayatri first he draws, then with the Anustubh,\nthen with the Tristubh; the Gayatri is brilliance, the Anustubh the sacrifice,\nthe Tristubh power; verily he encircles the sacrifice, with brilliance and\npower, on both sides.\n\n### v. 1. 4.\n\n'On the instigation of the god Savitr thee', (with these words) he digs, for\ninstigation. Then with it he produces smoke; 'Full of light, thee, O Agni, of\nfair aspect', he says, and thereby he produces light. Agni on birth afflicted\ncreatures with pain, him the gods appeased by the half-verse; 'auspicious and\nharmless to offspring', he says; verily he makes him appeased for offspring.\nHe digs with two (verses), for support. 'Thou art the back of the waters',\n(with these words) he takes the lotus leaf [1]; the lotus leaf is the back of\nthe waters; verily with its own form he takes it. He gathers with a lotus\nleaf; the lotus leaf is the birthplace of Agni; verily he gathers Agni with\nhis own birthplace. He gathers with a black antelope skin; the black antelope\nskin is the sacrifice; verily he gathers the sacrifice with the sacrifice. If\nhe were to gather with the skin of tame animals he would afflict with pain\ntame animals; he gathers with a black antelope skin; verily he afflicts with\npain wild animals [2]; therefore of animals of even birth the wild animals are\nthe smaller, for they are afflicted with pain. He gathers on the hairy side,\nfor on that side is it pure. He strews the lotus leaf and the black antelope\nskin together; the black antelope skin is this (earth), the lotus leaf yonder\n(sky); verily on both sides he encircles him with these two. Agni departed\nfrom the gods, Atharvan perceived him; 'Atharvan first pressed thee out, O\nAgni' [3], he says; verily he gathers him with him who perceived him. 'Thee, O\nAgni, from the lotus', he says, for in the lotus leaf he found him reposing.\n'Thee the sage, Dadhya\xc3\xb1c', he says; Dadhya\xc3\xb1c, son of Atharvan, was full of\nbrilliance; verily he bestows brilliance upon him. 'Thee Pathya Vrsan', he\nsays; verily with the latter (verse) he hails him whom he has previously\naddressed [4]. He gathers with four (verses), the metres are four; verily (he\ngathers) with the metres. (He gathers) with Gayatri verses for a Brahman, for\nthe Brahman is connected with the Gayatri; with Tristubh verses for a Rajanya,\nfor the Rajanya is connected with the Tristubh; if he desire of a man, 'May he\nbe richer', he should gather for him with both sets; verily upon him he\nbestows brilliance and power together. With eight (verses) he gathers; the\nGayatri has eight syllables, Agni is connected with the Gayatri; verily he\ngathers all the extent of Agni. 'Sit thou, O Hotr', he says; verily he makes\nthe deities sit down for him; 'The Hotr down', (with these words he makes) men\n(sit down); 'Sit thou down', (with these words he makes) birds (sit down); 'Be\nborn noble in the forefront of the days', he says; verily he produces for him\nthe common session of gods and men.\n\n### v. 1. 5.\n\nIn that he digs he acts as it were harshly to this (earth); he pours water\ndown, the waters are appeased; verily with the waters appeased he calms her\npain. 'May for thee Vayu, Matari\xc3\xa7van unite', he says; Vayu is breath; verily\nwith breath he unites her breath; 'may for thee Vayu', he says; therefore the\nrain speeds from the sky, made to fall by Vayu. 'To him, O goddess, be Vasat\nwith thee' [1], he says; the seasons are six; verily upon the seasons he\nbestows rain; therefore in all the seasons it rains. If he were to utter the\nVasat cry, his Vasat cry would be exhausted; if he were not to utter the Vasat\ncry, the Raksases would destroy the sacrifice; 'Vat', he says; verily,\nmysteriously he utters the Vasat cry; his Vasat cry is not exhausted, the\nRaksases do not destroy the sacrifice. 'Well born with light', (with these\nwords) he ties up with an Anustubh verse; all the metres are the Anustubh [2],\nAgni's dear body is the metres; verily he encircles him with his dear body;\nlikely to win a garment is he who knows thus. Agni when tied up is connected\nwith Varuna; 'Arise, thou of fair sacrifice', 'Arise, erect, to aid us', with\ntwo (verses) addressed to Savitr he rises up; verily, instigated by Savitr, he\nsends aloft the wrath of Varuna that is in him; with two (verses) (he arises),\nfor support. 'Born, thou art the child [3] of the two worlds, he says; the two\nworlds are these two (sky and earth), Agni is the child of the two; therefore\nhe says thus. 'O Agni, brilliant, distributed among the plants', he says, for\nwhen they distribute him, then he becomes more brilliant. 'Thou didst come\nthundering from thy mothers', he says; his mothers are the plants; verily from\nthem he makes him to fall. 'Be firm, of strong limbs', (with these words) he\nplaces (Agni) on the ass [4]; verily thereby he yokes it for strength. He\ngathers with the ass; therefore the ass is the best burden-gatherer of\nanimals. He gathers with the ass; therefore the ass, even when grazing is bad,\nbecomes fat beyond other animals, for by it they gather food and light. He\ngathers with the ass; therefore the ass, being of double seed, is born as the\nleast of animals, for Agni burns his place of birth. Now he is mounted upon\noffspring [5], and is strong to burn with pain offspring. 'Be auspicious, for\noffspring', he says; verily he makes him calm for offspring. '(For offspring)\nof man, O Angiras', he says, for offspring are of men. 'Scorch not sky and\nearth, nor the atmosphere, nor the trees', he says; verily he makes him calm\nfor these worlds. 'Let the steed advance, thundering', he says, for he is a\nsteed. 'The sounding, the donkey, the flier' [6], he says, for the seers\ncalled him the 'donkey'. 'Bearing Agni of the dust', he says, for he bears\nAgni. 'May he fall not before his day', he says; verily he bestows life upon\nhim; therefore an ass lives all its days; therefore are men afraid when an ass\nperishes before its day. 'The strong, bearing the strong Agni', he says, for\nhe is strong, and Agni is strong. 'Germ of the waters [7], him of the ocean',\nhe says, for Agni is the germ of the waters. 'O Agni, come hither for\nenjoyment', (at these words) the two worlds burst apart; in that he says, 'O\nAgni, come hither for enjoyment', it is for the separation ( _vityai_ ) of\nthese worlds. He, having left his place and not having reached a support, then\nthinks of the Adhvaryu and the sacrificer; 'holy order and truth', he says;\nholy order is this (earth), truth [8] is yonder (sky); verily in these two he\nestablishes him, and neither the Adhvaryu nor the sacrificer is ruined. Agni\nwhen tied up, as Varuna, attacks the sacrificer; 'O plants, do ye accept Agni\nhere', he says, for atonement. 'Casting aside all hostilities, all evil\nimaginings', he says, to smite away the Raksases. 'Sitting down, may he smite\naway from us misfortune', he says, for support. 'O plants, do ye rejoice [9]\nin him', he says; Agni's portion is the plants; verily he unites him with\nthem. 'Rich in flowers and having fair leaves', he says; therefore plants\nproduce fruit. 'This germ of yours, of due season, hath sat him in his ancient\nseat', he says; verily in those he establishes them from whom he makes him to\nfall. With two verses he deposits (it), for support.\n\n### v. 1. 6.\n\nAgni when tied up is connected with Varuna; 'With extending blaze', (with\nthese words) he unloosens (him); verily, instigated by Savitr, he lets loose\non all sides the wrath of Varuna that is in him. He pours water down; the\nwaters are appeased; verily by the waters appeased he calms his pain; with\nthree (verses) he pours (it) down, Agni is three fold; verily he calms Agni's\npain throughout his whole extent. 'Mitra having united the earth', he says;\nMitra is the auspicious one of the gods; verily [1] with him he unites him,\nfor atonement. If he were to unite him with sherds of domestic pots, he would\nafflict domestic pots with pain; he unites (him) with fragments of broken\npots; these are not used for life; verily he afflicts them with pain. He\nunites (him) with sand, for support, and for healing. He unites (him) with\ngoat-hair; the female goat is Agni's dear form; verily he unites him with his\ndear form, and thus with brilliance. He unites him with the hairs of a black\nantelope skin [2]; the black antelope skin is the sacrifice; verily he unites\nthe sacrifice with the sacrifice. 'The Rudras, having gathered together the\nearth', he says; these deities first gathered him together; verily with them\nhe gathers him together. 'Thou art the head of Makha', he says; Makha is the\nsacrifice, the firepan is his head; therefore he says thus. 'Ye are the two\nfeet of the sacrifice', he says, for these are the two feet of the sacrifice\n[3]; and also (it serves) for support. He hands (the pan) over with one set\n(of verses), and addresses it with another, to make a pairing. He makes it\nwith a triple stand; these worlds are three; (verily it serves) to obtain\nthese worlds. He makes (it) with the metres; the metres are strength; verily\nhe makes it with strength. He makes a hole with a Yajus, for discrimination.\nHe makes it so great, of equal girth with Prajapati, the beginning of the\nsacrifice. He makes it with two breasts, for the milking of sky and earth; he\nmakes it of four breasts, for the milking of cattle; he makes it of eight\nbreasts, for the milking of the metres. For him who practises witchcraft he\nshould make it nine cornered; verily gathering together the threefold\nthunderbolt he hurls it at his foe, to lay him low. 'Having made the great\npan', (with these words) he deposits (it); verily he establishes it among the\ndeities.\n\n### v. 1. 7.\n\nWith seven (verses) he fumigates; the breaths in the head are seven, the pan\nis the head of the sacrifice; verily he places the breaths in the head of the\nsacrifice; therefore seven are the breaths in the head. He fumigates with\nhorse-dung; the horse is connected with Prajapati; (verily it serves) to\nconnect it with its place of birth. 'May Aditi thee', he says; Aditi is this\n(earth); verily with Aditi in Aditi he digs, to avoid injury to it, for one\nhurts not oneself. 'May the wives of the gods thee', he says; the wives of the\ngods made it first [1]; verily with them he places it. 'May the Dhisanas\nthee', he says; the Dhisanas are the sciences; verily he enkindles it with the\nsciences. 'May the wives thee', he says; the wives are the metres; verily with\nthe wives he makes it cooked. 'May the protectors, he says; the protectors are\nthe Hotr's offices; verily with the Hotr's offices he cooks it. 'May the women\nthee', he says; the women are the wives of the gods [2]; verily with them he\ncooks it. With six (verses) he cooks; the seasons are six; verily with the\nseasons he cooks it. 'May they cook', he says twice; therefore twice in the\nyear does the corn ripen. The pan when enkindled is connected with Varuna; he\napproaches it with (a verse) addressed to Mitra, for atonement. 'May the god\nSavitr dig thee out', he says; verily, instigated by Savitr, he digs it out\nwith holy power and with the deities. 'Breaking not, O earth, fill the\nregions, the quarters' [3], he says; therefore Agni shines along all the\nquarters. 'Arise, become great, stand upright, be thou firm', he says, for\nsupport. A bowl that is not poured upon is connected with the Asuras; he pours\nupon it; verily he makes it to be with the gods; with goats' milk he pours\nupon it; the milk of the goat is the highest form of draught; verily he pours\nupon it with the highest draught; (he pours) with a Yajus, for discrimination.\nHe pours with the metres; with the metres it is made; verily with the metres\nhe pours upon the metres.\n\n### v. 1. 8.\n\nWith twenty-one beans he approaches the head of the man; beans are impure, the\nman's head is impure; verily by the impure he redeems its impurity and making\nit pure takes it. There are twenty-one; man is composed of twenty-one parts;\n(verily they serve) to obtain man. The man's head is impure as bereft of the\nbreaths; he deposits (it near) an ant-heap pierced in seven places; the\nbreaths in the head are seven; verily he unites it with the breaths, to make\nit pure. Of all those [1] that were comrades of death Yama holds the\noverlordship; he sings the verses of Yama; verily from Yama he redeems it;\nwith three he sings; three are these worlds; verily from these worlds he\nredeems it; therefore one should not give to one who sings, for the Gatha\nappropriates it. To the fires he offers animals; the fires are desires; verily\nhe wins his desires. If he were not to offer the animals, then he would not\nobtain animals [2]; if he were to let them go after circumambulation with\nfire, he would disturb the sacrifice; if he were to keep them until the\nconclusion, the heads would be exhausted; in that he offers the animals, he\nwins thereby animals; in that he lets them go after circumambulation with\nfire, (it serves) to prevent the exhaustion of the heads; he concludes (the\nrite) with (an animal) for Prajapati; Prajapati is the sacrifice; verily he\nconcludes the sacrifice in the sacrifice. Prajapati created offspring, he\nthought himself empty, he saw these April (verses), with them from the head\n[3] he satisfied himself. In that there are these April verses, and Prajapati\nis the sacrifice, he satisfies the sacrifice from the beginning with them.\nThey are of unlimited metres; Prajapati is unlimited; (verily they serve) to\nobtain Prajapati. The pairs are deficient and redundant, for propagation;\nhairy by name is that metre of Prajapati, animals are hairy; verily he wins\nanimals. There are all forms in these; all forms are made when Agni has to be\npiled up, therefore these appertain to Agni, to be piled [4]. Twenty-one\nkindling-(verses) be repeats; the twenty-onefold (Stoma) is light; verily he\nattains light, and a support besides, for the twenty-one fold (Stoma) is\nsupport. Twenty-four (verses) he recites; the year has twenty-four half-\nmonths, Agni Vai\xc3\xa7vanara is the year; verily straightway he wins Vai\xc3\xa7vanara. He\nrecites them straight on, for the world of heaven is as it were going straight\naway. 'Let the half-years, the seasons, increase thee, O Agni ', he says;\nverily with the half-years he causes Agni to increase [5], with the seasons\nthe year. 'Illuminate all the quarters of the earth', he says; therefore Agni\nilluminates all the quarters. 'The A\xc3\xa7vins removed death from him', he says;\nverily from him he repels death. 'We from the darkness', he says; the darkness\nis the evil one; verily from him he smites away the evil one. 'We have come to\nthe highest light', he says; the highest light is yonder sun; verily he\nattains unity with the sun. The year lags not, his future fails not, for whom\nthese are performed. The last he recites with the word 'light' in it; verily\nhe bestows on him light above, to reveal the world of heaven.\n\n### v. 1. 9.\n\nWith six (verses) he consecrates; the seasons are six; verily he consecrates\nhim with the seasons. With seven he consecrates; the metres are seven; verily\nhe consecrates him with the metres. 'Let every man of the god that leads',\nwith the final Anustubh he offers; the Anustubh is speech; therefore speech is\nthe highest of the breaths. The first quarter foot is deficient by one\nsyllable; therefore men live upon the incomplete part of speech. He offers\nwith a full (one), for Prajapati is full as it were; (verily it serves) to\nobtain Prajapati [1]; he offers with one that is deficient, for from the\ndeficient Prajapati created offspring; (verily it serves) for the creation of\noffspring. If he were to heat it on the flame, he would win what has been, if\non the embers, what is to be; he heats it on the embers; verily he wins what\nis to be, for what is to be is greater than what has been. With two verses he\nheats (it); the sacrificer has two feet; (verily it serves) for support. The\npan is gathered together with holy power and the Yajus; if it should break,\nthe sacrificer would be ruined [2], and his sacrifice destroyed. 'O Mitra, do\nthou heat this pan', he says; Mitra is holy power; verily on holy power he\nestablishes it; the sacrificer is not ruined, nor is his sacrifice destroyed.\nIf it should break, he should unite it with the selfsame potsherds; that is\nthe atonement for it. If a man has attained prosperity, he should for him\ndeposit (the fire) after producing it by friction; this is one that has\nsucceeded; verily he approaches his own deity [3]. For him who desires\nprosperity should be used (the fire) which comes to life from the pan, for\nfrom it is it produced, it is self-produced by name; verily he becomes\nprosperous. If he desire of a man, 'May I produce a foe for him', he should\ntake for him (fire) from elsewhere, and deposit it; verily straightway he\nproduces a foe for him. From a frying-pan he should (take fire) and deposit\n(it) for one who desires food; in a frying-pan food is kept; verily he wins\nfood with its birth place [4]. He deposits Mu\xc3\xb1ja grass; Mu\xc3\xb1ja is strength;\nverily he bestows upon him strength. Agni departed from the gods, he entered\nthe Krumuka wood; he deposits Krumuka; verily he wins what of Agni is there\nimbued. With butter he joins (it); butter is the dear home of Agni; verily he\nunites him with his dear abode, and with brilliance also [5]. He puts on (a\nstick) of Vikankata wood; verily he wins radiance; he puts on one of \xc3\x87ami, for\natonement. 'Do thou sit down in the lap of this mother', with three (verses)\nhe adores (the fire) when born; three are these worlds; verily he attains\nreputation in these worlds; verily also he bestows breaths on himself.\n\n### v. 1. 10.\n\nFormerly Agni would not burn what was not cut by the axe, but Prayoga, the\nseer, made that acceptable to him. 'Whatever logs we place on thee', (with\nthese words) he puts on a kindling-stick; verily he makes what is not cut by\nthe axe acceptable to him; all is acceptable to him who knows thus. He puts on\none of Udumbara wood; the Udumbara is strength; verily he confers strength\nupon him. Prajapati created Agni; him on creation the Raksases [1] were fain\nto destroy; he saw that (hymn) of the Raksas-slaying (one); therewith he smote\naway the Raksases; in that it is (the hymn) of the Raksas-slaying one, thereby\nhe drives away the Raksases from Agni when born. He puts on one of A\xc3\xa7vattha\nwood; of trees the A\xc3\xa7vattha is the overcomer of foes; (verily it serves) for\nvictory. He puts on one of Vikankata; verily he wins light. He puts on one of\n\xc3\x87ami wood, for atonement. 'Sharpened is my holy power', 'Their arms have I\nuplifted', (with these words) he makes him speak over the last two Udumbara\n(sticks) [2]; verily by means of the holy power he quickens the kingly power,\nand by the kingly power the holy power; therefore a Brahman who has a princely\nperson is superior to another Brahman; therefore a prince who has a Brahman is\nsuperior to another prince. Now Agni is death, gold is immortality; he puts a\ngold plate within; verily he severs immortality from death; it has twenty-one\nprojections, the worlds of the gods are twenty-one, the twelve months, the\nfour seasons, these three worlds, and as twenty-first yonder sun [3]; so many\nare the worlds of the gods; verily from them he severs his foe. By means of\nthe projections the gods reduced the Asuras to straits ( _nirbad e_); that is\nthe reason why projections ( _nirbadh ah_) have their names; it is covered\nwith projections; verily he reduces his foes to straits. He puts (it) on with\na verse addressed to Savitr, for instigation. 'Night and the dawn', with (this\nas) second; verily he raises him with day and night. 'The gods, granters of\nwealth, support Agni', be says; the gods, granters of wealth, are the breaths;\nverily having raised him with day and night [4] he supports him with the\nbreaths. Sitting he puts (it) on; therefore offspring are born sitting; the\nblack antelope skin is above; gold is brilliance, the black antelope skin is\nholy power; verily on both sides he encircles him, with brilliance and with\nholy power. The sling is of six fathoms in extent; the seasons are six; verily\nhe raises him with the seasons; if it is of twelve fathoms, (he raises him)\nwith the year. It is of Mu\xc3\xb1ja grass; the Mu\xc3\xb1ja is strength; verily he unites\nhim with strength. 'Thou art the bird of fair feathers', (with these words) he\ngazes; verily he declares his greatness in that form. 'Go to the sky, fly to\nthe heaven', he says; verily he makes him to go to the world of heaven.\n\n_\n\nThe Apri Hymn for the Horse Sacrifice\n\n_\n\n### v. 1. 11.\n\na Enkindled, decking the store-room of prayers,  \nSwelling with sweet butter, O Agni,  \nSteed bearing the strong drink, O all-knower,  \nCarry it to the dear place of the gods.  \nb With ghee adorning the paths leading to the gods,  \nLet the strong one, wise, go to the gods;  \nMay thee, O courser, the regions attend,  \nBestow strength on this sacrificer.  \nc To be praised thou art, and to be celebrated, O steed;  \nSwift and pure art thou, O courser;  \nMay Agni in unison with the gods, the Vasus,  \nBear thee [1], a glad messenger, he the all-knower.  \nd Rejoicing in the strewn grass, well strewed,  \nThat doth extend wide and broad on the earth,  \nJoined with the gods, may Aditi in unison,  \nBestowing pleasantness, cause it to prosper.  \nc These happy (doors), all formed,  \nOpening with their sides, with the centre,  \nLofty and sounding, adorning themselves,  \nThe doors divine, may they be of pleasant entrance.  \nf Moving between Mitra and Varuna,  \nWell knowing the beginning of sacrifices,  \nThe two dawns for you [2], rich in gold, rich in adornment,  \nI settle here in the birthplace of holy order.  \ng First for you have I made glad the two, who share one car, fair of hue,  \nThe gods that gaze on all the worlds,  \nThose that ordain your ordinances,  \nThe two Hotrs, that indicate the light in its place.  \nh May Bharati with the Adityas love our sacrifice;  \nSarasvati with the Rudras hath holpen us,  \nAnd Ida invoked with the Vasus in unison;  \nOur sacrifice, O goddesses, place ye with the immortals.  \ni Tvastr begot the hero with love for the gods;  \nFrom Tvastr is born the courser, the swift steed [3];  \nTvastr produced all this world;  \nThe maker of much do thou offer to, as Hotr.  \nk May the steed, anointed with glee, of his own impulse  \nGo to the gods in due season to their abode;  \nMay the forest lord knowing the world of the gods,  \nBear the oblations made ready by Agni.  \nl Waxing with the fervour of Prajapati,  \nImmediately on birth, O Agni, thou didst support the sacrifice  \nAs harbinger with the oblation offered with Hail!  \nDo thou go; let the gods eat the oblation duly.\n\n## PRAPATHAKA II\n\n_\n\nThe Preparation of the Ground for the Fire\n\n_\n\n### v. 2. 1.\n\nHeaded by Visnu the gods won finally these worlds by the metres; in that he\nstrides the strides of Visnu, the sacrificer becoming Visnu wins finally these\nworlds. 'Thou art the step of Visnu, overcoming hostility', he says; the earth\nis connected with the Gayatri, the atmosphere with the Tristubh, the sky with\nthe Jagati, the quarters with the Anustubh; verily he wins in order these\nworlds with the metres. Prajapati created Agni; he being created went away\nfrom him [1]; he followed him with this (verse), 'He hath cried'; with it he\nwon the home dear to Agni; in that he repeats this (verse), he wins thereby\nthe home dear to Agni. Now he who steps the strides of Visnu is apt as he goes\naway to be burnt up; he turns with four (verses); the. metres are four, Agni's\ndear body is the metres; verily he turns round on his dear body [2]; he turns\nround from left to right; verily he turns round on his own strength; therefore\nthe right side of the body is the stronger; verily also does he turn with the\nturning of the sun. Varuna seized \xc3\x87unah\xc3\xa7epa Ajigarti, he saw this verse\naddressed to Varuna, by it he freed himself from the noose of Varuna; Varuna\nseizes him who takes the fire-pan; 'From us the highest knot, O Varuna', he\nsays; verily thereby he frees himself from Varuna's noose [3]. 'I have drawn\nthee', he says, for he draws him. 'Be thou firm and motionless', he says, for\nsupport. 'Let all the folk desire thee', he says; verily with the folk he\nunites him. 'In him establish the kingdom', he says; verily in him he makes\nthe kingdom to abide. If he desire of a man, 'May he be a ruler', he should\nthink of him with his mind; verily he becomes a ruler [4]. 'In greatness he\nhath risen erect in the van of the dawns', he says; verily he makes him the\nfirst of his peers. 'Emerging from the darkness', he says; verily he smites\naway darkness from him. 'He hath come with the light', he says; verily he\nbestows light upon him. He places him with four (verses); the metres are four;\nverily with the metres (he places him); with an Atichandas as the last; the\nAtichandas is the highest of metres; verily he makes him the highest of his\npeers; it contains [5] the word 'sit' ( _sad_ ); verily he makes him attain\nreality ( _sat-tv am_). With (the hymn) of Vatsapri he reverences (him); by\nthat did Vatsapri Bhalandana win the home dear to Agni; verily by it he wins\nthe home dear to Agni. It has eleven (verses); verily in eleven places he\nbestows strength on the sacrificer. By the Stoma the gods prospered in this\nworld, by the metres in yonder world; the hymn of Vatsapri is the type of the\nStoma; in that he pays reverence with (the hymn) of Vatsapri [6], he wins with\nit this world; in that he strides the steps of Visnu, he wins by them yonder\nworld. On the first day he strides forth, on the next day he pays reverence;\ntherefore the minds of some creatures are set on energy, those of others on\nrest; therefore the active lords it over him who takes his ease therefore the\nactive fixes upon a man who takes his ease. He clenches his fist, he restrains\nhis speech, for support.\n\n### v. 2. 2.\n\n'O lord of food, accord us food', he says; the lord of food is Agni; verily he\ngrants him food. 'Uninjurious, impetuous', he says; he means in fact 'free\nfrom disease'. 'Do thou further the donor, bestow strength on our bipeds, our\nquadrupeds', he says; verily he invokes this blessing. 'May the All-gods bear\nthee up', he says; the All-gods are the breaths [1]; verily with the breaths\nhe raises him. 'O Agni, with their thoughts', he says; with the purpose for\nwhich he raises him, he verily unites him. He places (him) with four (verses);\nthe metres are four; verily with the metres (he places him); with an\nAtichandas as the last; the Atichandas is the highest of the metres; verily he\nmakes him the highest of his peers; it contains the word 'sit' (sad); verily\nhe makes him attain reality ( _sat-tv am_). 'Come forward, O Agni, rich in\nlight' [2], he says; verily he bestows light upon him. With his body he\ninjures him whom he injures; 'Harm not our offspring with thy body', he says;\nverily for his offspring he makes him gentle. The Raksases infest that\nsacrifice where the axle creaks; 'He hath cried', he repeats, to smite away\nthe Raksases. They bear (him) with a cart; verily he confers honour upon him;\ntherefore he that has a cart and he that has a chariot are of guests [3] the\nmost honoured: honour is his who knows thus. 'With kindling-wood serve Agni',\n(with these words) he puts a kindling-stick, made wet with ghee, upon him when\nput in place; that is as when hospitality with melted butter is offered to a\nguest on arrival; (he puts it on) with a Gayatri for a Brahman, for the\nBrahman is connected with the Gayatri, with a Tristubh for a Rajanya, for the\nRajanya is connected with the Tristubh. He casts the ash into the waters;\nAgni's place of birth is in the waters; verily he makes him attain his own\nplace of birth; with three (verses) he casts (it); Agni is threefold [4];\nverily he makes Agni attain support through all his extent. Now he casts away\nAgni who puts the ash into the waters; he places it (in the pan) with (verses)\ncontaining the word 'light'; verily he bestows light upon him; with two (he\nplaces it), for support. He throws away offspring and cattle who puts the ash\nin the waters; 'Return with strength', 'With wealth', (with these words) he\ncomes back; verily he bestows upon himself offspring and cattle. 'May the\nAdityas [5], the Rudras, the Vasus kindle thee again', he says; these deities\nfirst kindled him; verily by them he kindles him. 'Hearken', 'Be thou', (with\nthese words) he pays reverence; verily he awakens him; therefore after\nsleeping creatures awake. In his place he pays reverence, and therefore cattle\nreturning go to their place.\n\n### v. 2. 3.\n\nYama holds the overlordship of the whole extent of earth; he who without\nasking from Yama a place of it for divine sacrifice piles up the fire is\npiling it for Yama. 'Go hence', (with these words) he makes him fix (on the\nplace); verily having asked from Yama a place of it for divine sacrifice, he\npiles the fire for himself. Seeking they could not find so much as an arrow\npoint of it which was not covered with death; the gods saw this Yajus, 'Go\nhence'; in that he makes him fix with this [1], he piles the fire on a place\nfreed from death. He throws up (the earth); verily he smites away any impurity\nin it; he sprinkles water on, for atonement. He puts down sand; that is the\nform of Agni Vai\xc3\xa7vanara; verily by his form he wins Vai\xc3\xa7vanara. He puts down\nsalt; salt is the nourishment and the propagating; verily he piles the fire in\nnourishment, in propagation, and also in concord; for the salt is the concord\n[2] of cattle. Sky and earth were together; separating they said, 'Let us\nshare together what is worthy of sacrifice'. What of yonder (sky) was worthy\nof sacrifice, it placed in this (earth), that became salt; what of this\n(earth) was worthy of sacrifice, it placed in yonder (sky) and that is yonder\nblack in the moon; when he puts down the salt he should think of yonder\n(black); verily he piles the fire in that of sky and earth which is worthy of\nsacrifice. 'This is that Agni' is Vi\xc3\xa7vamitra's [3] hymn; by that Vi\xc3\xa7vamitra\nwon the abode dear to Agni; verily by it he wins the abode dear to Agni. By\nthe metres the gods went to the world of heaven; he places four (bricks)\npointing east the metres are four; verily by the metres the sacrificer goes to\nthe world of heaven. As they went to the world of heaven, the quarters were\nconfused; they put down two in front, facing the same way, and two [4] behind,\nfacing the same way; by them they made firm the quarters. In that he places\ntwo in front, facing the same way, and two behind, facing the same way, (it\nserves) to make firm the quarters; again, the metres are cattle; verily he\nmakes cattle available for him. He places eight (bricks); the Gayatri has\neight syllables, Agni is connected with the Gayatri; verily he piles Agni in\nhis full extent. He places eight; the Gayatri has eight syllables; the Gayatri\nknows in truth the world of heaven; (verily it serves) to reveal the world of\nheaven [5]. He places thirteen world-fillers; they make twenty-one, the\ntwenty-onefold Stoma is a support, the Garhapatya is a support, verily he\nfinds support in the support of the twenty-onefold (Stoma), the Garhapatya; he\nwho knows thus finds support in the fire which he has piled. He who first\npiles (the fire) should pile in five layers; the sacrifice is fivefold, cattle\nare fivefold; verily he wins the sacrifice and cattle. He who piles for a\nsecond time should pile in three layers; these worlds are three; verily he\nfinds support [6] in these worlds. He who piles for a third time should pile\nin one layer; the world of heaven is in one place; verily he goes to the world\nof heaven by the single (layer). He makes (them) firm with mortar; therefore\nthe bone is covered with meat; he who knows thus does not become diseased of\nskin. There are five layers, he makes firm with five (sets of) dust; they make\nup ten, the Viraj has ten syllables, the Viraj is food; verily he finds\nsupport in the Viraj, in proper food.\n\n### v. 2. 4.\n\nThe Agni that was before and the one in the fire-pan are at variance; 'Be\nunited', with four (verses) he unites them together; the metres are four,\nAgni's dear body is the metres; verily with his dear body he puts them in\norder. 'Be united, he says; therefore the kingly power unites with the holy\npower; in that after uniting (them) he separates (them), therefore the holy\npower separates from the kingly power. With the seasons [1] they consecrate\nhim; with the seasons likewise he must be set free; 'As a mother her son, the\nearth Agni of the dust', he says; verily having consecrated him with the\nseasons, with the season he sets him free. With (a verse) addressed to\nVai\xc3\xa7vanara, he takes the sling; verily he makes it ready. For Nirrti there are\nthree (bricks) black, dried by a chaff fire; chaff is the portion of Nirrti,\nblack is the form of Nirrti; verily by her own form he propitiates Nirrti.\nThey go to this quarter; this [2] is the quarter of Nirrti; verily in her own\nquarter he propitiates Nirrti. He places (it) in a self-made hole or a cleft;\nthat is the abode of Nirrti; verily he propitiates Nirrti in her own abode. He\nplaces (them) over against the sling, the noose is connected with Nirrti;\nverily he frees him straightway from the noose of Nirrti. He places three, man\nis threefold in arrangement; verily he removes by sacrifice Nirrti from the\nwhole extent of man. He places them going away (from the place of sacrifice);\nverily he drives away Nirrti from him [3]. They return without looking round,\nto conceal Nirrti. Having purified, they pay reverence, for purity. To the\nGarhapatya they pay reverence; verily having wandered in the world of Nirrti,\nthey return, purified, to the world of the gods. They pay reverence with one\n(verse); verily in one place they bestow strength on the sacrificer. 'Abode\nand collector of riches', he says; rich are offspring and cattle; verily he\nunites him with offspring and cattle.\n\n### v. 2. 5.\n\nWith man's measure he metes out; man is commensurate with the sacrifice;\nverily he metes him with a member of the sacrifice; so great is he as a man\nwith arms extended; so much strength is there in man; verily with strength he\nmetes him. Winged is he, for wingless he could not fly; these wings are longer\nby an ell; therefore birds have strength by their wings. The wings and the\ntail are a fathom in breadth; so much is the strength in man [1], he is\ncommensurate in strength. He metes with a bamboo; the bamboo is connected with\nAgni; (verily it serves) to unite him with his birthplace. With a Yajus he\nyokes (the team), with a Yajus he ploughs, for discrimination. He ploughs with\na (team) of six oxen; the seasons are six; verily with the seasons he ploughs\nhim. In that (he ploughs) with (a team) of twelve oxen, (he ploughs) with the\nyear. This (earth) was afraid of excessive burning by Agni; she saw this of\ntwo sorts, ploughed and unploughed [2], then indeed he did not burn her\nexcessively; in that there is ploughed and unploughed, (it serves to prevent)\nher being excessively burned. 'He should restrain Agni when twofold', they\nsay; in that there is ploughed and unploughed (it serves) to restrain Agni. So\nmany are animals, bipeds and quadrupeds; if he were to let them loose to the\neast, he would give them over to Rudra; if to the south, he would deliver them\nto the Pitrs; if to the west, the Raksases would destroy them; to the north he\nlet them loose; this is the auspicious quarter of gods and men (3); verily he\nlets them loose in that direction. Again he lets them loose to this quarter,\nthe breath is yonder sun: verily he lets them loose following the breath. From\nleft to right they turn, around their own strength they turn; therefore the\nright side of the body is the stronger; verily they turn with the turning of\nthe sun. Therefore cattle depart from (us), and come back towards (us). Three\nby three he ploughs the furrows [4]; verily he extends the threefold (Stoma)\nin the beginning of the sacrifice. He scatters plants, by holy power he wins\nfood, in the Arka the Arka is piled. With fourteen verses he scatters; the\ndomesticated plants are seven, the wild are seven; (verily they serve) to win\nboth sets. He scatters (seeds) of diverse kinds of food, to win diverse foods.\nHe scatters on the ploughed (ground), for in the ploughed plants find support.\nHe scatters along the furrows, for propagation. In twelve furrows he scatters;\nthe year has twelve months; verily with the year he cooks food for him. If he\nwho piles the fire [5] should eat of what has not been obtained, he would be\nseparated from what has been obtained. Those trees which bear fruit he should\nsprinkle in the kindling-wood, to obtain what has not been obtained. From the\nquarters he gathers clods; verily winning the strength of the quarters, he\npiles the fire in the strength of the quarters; he should take a clod from the\nquarter where is he whom he hates, (saying), 'Food and strength do I take\nhence', verily he wins from that quarter food and strength, and hungry is he\nwho is in that quarter. He scatters over the high altar, for on the high altar\nis the fire piled; the high altar is cattle; verily he wins cattle; (verily it\nserves) for the avoidance of passing over a limb of the sacrifice.\n\n### v. 2. 6.\n\n'O Agni, strength and fame are thine', (with these words) he scatters sand;\nthat is the hymn of Agni Vai\xc3\xa7vanara; verily with the hymn he wins (Agni)\nVai\xc3\xa7vanara. With six (verses) he scatters; the year has six seasons, Agni\nVai\xc3\xa7vanara is the year; verily straightway he wins Vai\xc3\xa7vanara. This metre is\ncalled the ocean; offspring are born like the ocean; in that he scatters sand\nwith this (hymn), (it is) for the propagation of offspring. Indra [1] hurled\nhis bolt at Vrtra; it parted into three, one third the wooden sword, one-third\nthe chariot, one-third the sacrificial post; the interior reeds which were\ncrushed became gravel; that is the explanation of gravel; gravel is a\nthunderbolt, the fire is an animal; in that he supports the fire with gravel,\nhe encircles with the bolt cattle for him; therefore cattle are encircled with\nthe bolt; therefore the stronger does not receive the weaker. He should\nsupport (the fire) with twenty-one (pieces of gravel) for one who desires\ncattle [2]; there are seven breaths in the head, cattle are the breaths;\nverily he wins cattle for him by the breaths. With twenty-seven (should he\nsupport it) for one who has foes; thus making the threefold bolt he hurls it\nat his foe, to lay him low. He should support (it) with unnumbered ones, to\nwin what is unnumbered. If he desire of a man, 'May he be without cattle',\nthen without piling the gravel in support, he should separate the sand; verily\nhe pours forth for him the seed on all sides in (a place) not encircled;\nverily he becomes without cattle [3]. If he desire of a man, 'May he be rich\nin cattle,' he should separate the sand, after piling the gravel; verily he\npours forth for him the seed in one direction in an encircled (place), and he\nbecomes rich in cattle. With (a verse) addressed to Soma he separates (the\nsand); Soma is impregnator of seed; verily he impregnates seed; with a Gayatri\nfor a Brahman, for the Brahman is connected with the Gayatri, with a Tristubh\nfor a Rajanya, for the Rajanya is connected with the Tristubh. To \xc3\x87amyu, son\nof Brhaspati, the sacrifice did not resort; it entered the fire [4]; it\ndeparted from the fire in the form of a black antelope, it entered the horse,\nit became the intermediate hoof of the horse; in that he makes the horse\nadvance, he wins the sacrifice which has entered the horse. 'By Prajapati must\nthe fire be piled', they say; the horse is connected with Prajapati; in that\nhe makes the horse advance, by Prajapati he piles the fire. He puts down a\nlotus leaf; the lotus leaf is the birthplace of the fire; verily he piles the\nfire with its own birthplace. 'Thou art the back of the waters', (with these\nwords) he puts (it) down; the lotus leaf is the back of the waters; verily\nwith its form he puts it down.\n\n### v. 2. 7.\n\n'The holy power born', (with these words) he puts down the gold disk.\nPrajapati created creatures with the Brahman class as first; verily the\nsacrificer creates offspring with the Brahman as first; 'the holy power born',\nhe says; therefore the Brahman is the first; the first he becomes who knows\nthus. The theologians say, 'Nor on earth, nor in the atmosphere, nor on sky\nshould the fire be piled'; if he were to pile (it) on earth, he would afflict\nthe earth with pain; nor trees, nor plants would [1] be born; if he should\npile (it) in the atmosphere, he would afflict the atmosphere with pain, the\nbirds would not be born; if he should pile (it) in the sky, he would afflict\nthe sky with pain, Parjanya would not rain. He puts down a gold disk; gold is\nimmortality; verily in immortality he piles the fire, for propagation. He puts\ndown a golden man, to support the world of the sacrificer; if he were to put\nit over the perforation in the brick, he would obstruct the breath of cattle\nand of the sacrificer; he puts it down on the south side [2] with head to the\neast: he supports the world of the sacrificer; he does not obstruct the breath\nof cattle and the sacrificer. Or rather he does place it over the perforation\nof the brick, to allow the breath to pass out. 'The drop hath fallen', (with\nthese words) he touches it; verily he establishes it in the Hotr's offices. He\nputs down two ladles, one made of Karsmarya and full of butter, one of\nUdumbara and full of curds; that made of Karsmarya is this (earth), that of\nUdumbara is yonder (sky); verily he deposits these two (earth and sky) [3]. In\nsilence he puts (them) down, for he should not obtain them with a Yajus; the\nKarsmarya on the south, the Udumbara on the north; therefore is yonder (sky)\nhigher than this (earth); the Karsmarya filled with butter, the butter is a\nthunderbolt, the Karsmarya is a thunderbolt; verily by the thunderbolt he\nsmites away the Raksases from the south of the sacrifice; the Udumbara filled\nwith curds, curds are cattle, the Udumbara is strength; verily he confers\nstrength upon cattle. He puts (them) down filled; verily filled they wait on\nhim [4] in yonder world. 'In the Viraj should the fire be piled', they say;\nthe Viraj is the ladle; in that he puts down two ladles, he piles Agni in the\nViraj. As each beginning of the sacrifice is being performed, the Raksases\nseek to destroy the sacrifice; the golden disk is a beginning of the\nsacrifice; in that he pours butter over the gold disk, he smites away the\nRaksases from the beginning of the sacrifice. With five (verses) he pours\nbutter; the sacrifice is fivefold; verily he smites away the Raksases from the\nwhole extent of the sacrifice; he pours butter transversely; therefore animals\nmove their limbs transversely, for support.\n\n### v. 2. 8.\n\nHe puts down the naturally perforated brick; the naturally perforated brick is\nthis (earth); verily he puts down the (earth). He makes the horse sniff it;\nverily he bestows breath upon it; now the horse is connected with Prajapati;\nverily he piles the fire with Prajapati. The first brick that is put down\nobstructs the breath of cattle and of the sacrificer; it is a naturally\nperforated one, to permit the breath to pass, and also to reveal the world of\nheaven. 'In the fire must the fire be piled', they say; the Brahman [1] is\nAgni Vai\xc3\xa7vanara, and to him should he hand over the first brick over which a\nYajus has been recited; with the Brahman he should deposit it; verily in the\nfire he piles the fire. Now he who ignorantly puts down a brick is liable to\nexperience misfortune. Three boons should he give, the breaths are three;\n(verily they serve) to guard the breaths; two only should be given, for the\nbreaths are two; one only should be given, for the breath is one. The fire is\nan animal here [2]; animals do not find pleasure in want of grass; a brick of\nDurva grass he puts down, to support animals; with two (verses), for support.\n'Arising from every stem', he says, for it finds support with every stem; 'do\nthou, O Durva, extend us with a thousand, a hundred', he says; Prajapati is\nconnected with a thousand; (verily it serves) to obtain Prajapati. The fact\nthat it has three lines on it is a mark of the gods; the gods put it down with\nthe mark uppermost, the Asuras with the mark undermost [3]; if he desire of a\nman, 'May he become richer', he should put it down for him mark uppermost;\nverily he becomes richer; if he desire of a man, 'May he become worse off', he\nshould put his down mark undermost; verily he makes him depressed in\naccordance with its birthplace among the Asuras, and he becomes worse off.\n(The brick) has three lines on it; that with three lines is these worlds;\nverily he excludes its foe from these worlds. When the Angirases went to the\nworld of heaven, the sacrificial cake becoming a tortoise crawled after them\n[4]; in that he puts down a tortoise, just as one who knows a place leads\nstraight (to it), so the tortoise leads him straight to the world of heaven.\nThe tortoise is the intelligence of animals; in that he puts down the\ntortoise, animals resort there, seeing their own intelligence; in that the\nheads of the dead animals are deposited, a burial-ground is made; in that he\nputs down the living tortoise, he is no maker of a burial-ground, the tortoise\nis suitable for a dwelling [5]. 'To the pious the winds honey', (with these\nwords) he anoints with curds, mixed with honey; verily he makes him ready;\ncurds is a food of the village, honey of the wild; in that he anoints with\ncurds mixed with honey, (it serves) to win both. 'May the two great ones,\nheaven and earth', he says; verily with them he encircles him on both sides.\nHe puts it down to the east,' to attain the world of heaven; he puts it down\nto the east facing west; therefore [6] to the east facing west the animals\nattend the sacrifice. If he piles the fire without a navel, (the fire) enters\nthe navel of the sacrificer, and is liable to injure him. He puts down the\nmortar; this is the navel of the fire; verily he piles the fire with its\nnavel, to avoid injury. (The mortar) is of Udumbara wood; the Udumbara is\nstrength; verily he wins strength; in the middle he puts it down; verily in\nthe middle he bestows strength upon him; therefore in the middle men enjoy\nstrength. So large is it, commensurate with Prajapati, the mouth of the\nsacrifice. He pounds; verily he makes food; he puts (it) down with (a verse)\naddressed to Visnu; the sacrifice is Visnu, the trees are connected with\nVisnu; verily in the sacrifice he establishes the sacrifice.\n\n### v. 2. 9.\n\nThe pan is the concentrated light of these lights; in that he puts down the\npan, verily he wins the light from these worlds; in the middle he puts (it)\ndown; verily he bestows upon it light; therefore in the middle we reverence\nthe light; with sand he fills (it); that is the form of Agni Vai\xc3\xa7vanara;\nverily by his form he wins Vai\xc3\xa7vanara. If he desire of a man, 'May he become\nhungry', he should put down for one (a pan) deficient in size [1]; if he\ndesire of a man, 'May he eat food that fails not', he should put it down full;\nverily he eats food that fails not. The man accords a thousand of cattle, the\nother animals a thousand; in the middle he puts down the head of the man, to\ngive it strength. In the pan he puts (it) down; verily he makes it attain\nsupport; the head of the man is impure as devoid of breaths; the breaths are\nimmortality [2], gold is immortality; on the (organs of the) breaths he hurls\nchips of gold; verily he makes it attain support, and unites it with the\nbreaths. He fills (it) with curds mixed with honey, (saying) 'May I be fit to\ndrink honey'; (he fills with curds) to be curdled with hot milk, for purity.\nThe curds are the food of the village, honey of the wild; in that he fills\n(it) with curds mixed with honey, (it serves) to win both. He puts down the\nheads of the animals; the heads of the animals are cattle; verily he wins\ncattle. If he desire of a man, 'May he have no cattle'[3], he should put them\ndown, looking away, for him; verily he makes cattle look away from him; he\nbecomes without cattle. If he desire of a man, 'May he be rich in cattle', he\nshould put (them) down looking with (the man's head); verily he makes the\ncattle look with him; he becomes rich in cattle. He puts (the head) of the\nhorse in the east looking west, that of the bull in the west looking east; the\nbeasts other than the oxen and the horses are not beasts at all; verily he\nmakes the oxen and the horses look with him. So many are the animals [4],\nbipeds and quadrupeds; them indeed he puts down in the fire, in that he puts\ndown the heads of the animals. 'I appoint for thee N.N. of the forest', he\nsays; verily from the cattle of the village he sends pain to those of the\nwild; therefore of animals born at one time the animals of the wild are the\nsmaller, for they are afflicted with pain. He puts down the head of a snake;\nverily he wins the brilliance that is in the snake [5]. If he were to put it\ndown looking with the heads of the animals, (the snakes) would bite the\nanimals of the village; if turned away, those of the wild; he should speak a\nYajus, he wins the brilliance that is in the snake, he injures not the animals\nof the village, nor those of the wild. Or rather should it be put down; in\nthat he puts down, thereby he wins the brilliance that is in the serpent; in\nthat he utters a Yajus, thereby is it appeased.\n\n_\n\nThe First Layer of Bricks\n\n_\n\n### v. 2. 10.\n\nThe fire is an animal, now the birthplace of the animal is changed in that\nbefore the putting up of the bricks the Yajus is performed. The water bricks\nare seed; be puts down the water bricks; verily he places seed in the womb.\nFive he puts down (on the east) cattle are fivefold; verily he produces cattle\nfor him; five on the south, the water bricks are the thunderbolt; verily with\nthe thunderbolt he smites away the Raksases from the south of the sacrifice;\nfive he puts down on the west [1], pointing east; seed is impregnated in front\nfrom behind; verily from behind he deposits seed for him in front. Five he\nputs down on the east, pointing west; five on the west pointing east;\ntherefore seed is impregnated in front, offspring are born at the back. On the\nnorth he puts down five metre bricks; the metre bricks are cattle; verily he\nbrings cattle on birth to his own dwelling. This (earth) was afraid of\nexcessive burning by the fire; she saw these [2] water bricks, she put them\ndown, then (the fire) did not burn her excessively; in that he puts down the\nwater bricks, (it is) to avoid excessive burning. She said, 'He shall eat food\nwith holy power, for whom these shall be put down, and he who shall know them\nthus.' He puts down the breath-supporting (bricks); verily he places the\nbreaths in the seed; therefore an animal is born with speech, breath, sight,\nand bearing. 'This one in front [3], the existent'; (with these words) he puts\ndown on the east; verily with these he supports breath. 'This one on the\nright, the all-worker', (with these words he puts down) on the south; verily\nwith these he supports mind. 'This one behind, the all-extending', (with these\nwords he puts down) on the west; verily with these he supports sight. 'This\none on the left, the light', (with these words he puts down) on the north;\nverily with these he supports hearing. 'This one above, thought', (with these\nwords he puts down) above; verily with these he supports speech. Ten by ten he\nputs (them) down, to give strength. Transversely [4] he puts (them) down;\ntherefore transversely do animals move their limbs, for support. With those\n(put down) on the east Vasistha prospered, with those on the south Bharadvaja,\nwith those on the west Vi\xc3\xa7vamitra, with those on the north Jamadagni, with\nthose above Vi\xc3\xa7vakarman. He who knows thus the prosperity in these (bricks)\nprospers; he who knows thus their relationship becomes rich in relations; he\nwho knows thus their ordering, (things) go orderly [5] for him; he who knows\nthus their abode becomes possessed of an abode; he who knows thus their\nsupport becomes possessed of support. Having put down the breath-supporters he\nputs down the unifying (bricks); verily having deposited in him the breaths he\nunifies them with the unifying (bricks); that is why the unifying have their\nname. Then too he puts inspiration upon expiration; therefore expiration and\ninspiration move together. He puts (them) down pointing in different\ndirections; therefore expiration and inspiration go in different directions.\nThe ununified part of the fire [6] is not worthy of heaven; the fire is worthy\nof heaven; in that he puts down the unifying (bricks), he unifies it; verily\nhe makes it worthy of heaven. 'The eighteen-month-old calf the strength, the\nKrta of throws at dice', he says; verily by the strengths he wins the throws,\nand by the throws the strengths. On all sides (these verses) have the word\nwind', and therefore the (wind) blows on all sides.\n\n_\n\nThe Horse Sacrifice (continued)\n\n_\n\n### v. 2. 11.\n\na May the Gayatri, the Tristubh, the Jagati,  \nThe Anustubh, with the Pankti,  \nThe Brhati, the Usnih, and the Kakubh,  \nPierce thee with needles.  \nb May the two-footed, the four-footed,  \nThe three-footed, the six-footed,  \nThe metrical, the unmetrical,  \nPierce thee with needles.  \nc May the Mahanamnis, the Revatis,  \nAll the regions that are rich in fruits,  \nThe lightnings of the clouds, the voices.  \nPierce thee with needles.  \nd The silver, the gold, the leaden,  \nAre yoked as workers with the works,  \nOn the skin of the strong horse,  \nMay they pierce thee with needles.  \ne May the ladies [1], the wives,  \nWith skill separate thy hair,  \nThe wives of the gods, the quarters,  \nPierce thee with needles.  \nf What then? As men who have barley  \nReap the barley in order, removing it,  \nHither bring the food of those  \nWho have not gone to the reverential cutting of the strew.\n\n### v. 2. 12.\n\na Who cutteth thee? Who doth divide thee  \nWho doth pierce thy limbs?  \nWho, too, is thy wise dissector?  \nb May the seasons in due season,  \nThe dissectors, divide thy joints,  \nAnd with the splendour of the year  \nMay they pierce thee with needles.  \nc May the divine Adhvaryus cut thee,  \nAnd divide thee;  \nMay the piercers piercing  \nJoint thy limbs.  \nd May the half-months, the months,  \nCut thy joints, piercing,  \nMay the days and nights, the Maruts,  \nMake whole thine injuries [1].  \ne May the earth with the atmosphere,  \nMay Vayu heal thy rent,  \nMay the sky with the Naksatras  \nArrange thy form aright.  \nf Healing to thy higher limbs,  \nHealing to thy lower;  \nHealing to bones, marrow,  \nHealing too to thy body!\n\n## PRAPATHAKA III\n\n_\n\nThe Second and Later Layers of Bricks\n\n_\n\n### v. 3. 1.\n\nNow this fire (ritual) is an extensive sacrifice; what part of it is performed\nor what not? The part of the sacrifice which is performed that is omitted\nbecomes rotten; be puts down the A\xc3\xa7vin (bricks); the A\xc3\xa7vins are the physicians\nof the gods; verily by them be produces medicine for it. Five he puts down;\nthe sacrifice is fivefold; verily he produces medicine for the whole extent of\nthe sacrifice. He puts down the seasonal (bricks), to arrange the seasons [1].\nFive he puts down; the seasons are five; verily he arranges the seasons in\ntheir whole number. They begin and end alike; therefore the seasons are alike;\nthey differ in one foot; therefore the seasons differ likewise. He puts down\nthe breath-supporters; verily he places the breaths in the months; therefore\nbeing alike the seasons do not grow old; moreover he generates them. The\nbreath is the wind; in that having put down the seasonal (bricks) he puts down\nthe breath-sup porters [2], therefore the wind accompanies all the seasons. He\nputs down the rain-winners; verily he wins rain. If he were to put them down\nin one place, then would fall rain in one season only; he puts them down after\ncarrying them round in order; therefore it rains in all the seasons. Since\nhaving put down the breath-supporters he puts down the rain-winners, therefore\nthe rain starts from the sky, impelled downwards by the wind. The\nstrengthening (bricks) are cattle; cattle have various purposes and various\ncustoms, but only as regards water are they of one purpose [3]; if he desire\nof a man, 'May he be without cattle', he should put down for him the\nstrengthening (bricks) and then put down the water (bricks); verily he makes\ndiscord for him with cattle; verily he becomes without cattle. If he desire of\na man, 'May he possess cattle', he should put down for him the water (bricks)\nand then put down the strengthening (bricks); verily he makes concord for him\nwith cattle and he becomes possessed of cattle. He puts down four in front;\ntherefore the eye has four forms, two white, two black [4]. The (verses)\ncontain the word 'head'; therefore the head (of the fire) is in front. Five he\nputs down in the right hip, five in the left; therefore the animal is broader\nbehind and receding in front; 'The goat in strength', (with these words he\nputs down) on the right shoulder; (with) 'The ram in strength', on the left;\nverily he puts together the shoulders (of the fire). 'The tiger in strength',\n(with these words) he puts down in the right wing, (with) 'The lion in\nstrength' on the left; verily he gives strength to the wings. (With) 'The man\nin strength' (he puts down) in the middle; therefore man is overlord of\nanimals.\n\n### v. 3. 2.\n\n'O Indra and Agni, (the brick) that quaketh not', (with these words) he puts\ndown the naturally perforated (brick); these worlds are separated by Indra and\nAgni; (verily it serves) to separate these worlds. Now the middle layer is, as\nit were, insecure, it is as it were the atmosphere; 'Indra and Agni', he says;\nIndra and Agni are the supporters of force among the gods; verily he piles it\nwith force in the atmosphere, for support. He puts down the naturally\nperforated (brick); the naturally perforated (brick) is the atmosphere; verily\nhe puts down the atmosphere [1]. He makes the horse sniff it; verily he puts\nbreath in it; now the horse is connected with Prajapati; verily by Prajapati\nhe piles the fire. It is a naturally perforated (brick), to allow the passage\nof the breaths, and also for the lighting up of the world of heaven. When the\ngods went to the world of heaven, the quarters were in confusion; they saw\nthese regional (bricks), they put them down, and by them they made firm the\nquarters; in that he put down the regional bricks, (it is) to support the\nquarters. Ten breath supporters he places in the east [2]; the breaths in man\nare nine, the navel is the tenth; verily he places the breaths in front;\ntherefore the breaths are in front. He puts down the last with the word\n'light'; there fore speech, which is the last, is the light of the breaths. He\nput down ten; the Viraj has ten syllables, the light of the metres is the\nViraj; verily he puts the light in the east; therefore we revere the light in\nthe east. The metres ran a race for the cattle; the Brhati won them; there\nfore cattle are called connected with the Brhati [3]. 'Ma metre', (with these\nwords) he puts down on the south; therefore the months turn south wards;\n(with) 'Earth metre' (he puts down) on the west, for support; (with) 'Agni,\nthe deity' (he puts down) on the north; Agni is might; verily on the north he\nplaces might; therefore he that advances to the north is victorious. They make\nup thirty-six; the Brhati has thirty-six syllables, cattle are connected with\nthe Brhati; verily by the Brhati he wins cattle for him. The Brhati holds the\nsovereignty of the metres; he for whom these [4] are put down attains\nsovereignty. He puts down seven Valakhilya, (bricks) in the east, seven in the\nwest; in the head there are seven breaths, two below; (verily they serve) to\ngive the breaths strength. 'The head thou art, ruling', (with these words) he\nputs down on the east; 'Thou art the prop ruling', (with these words) he puts\ndown on the west; verily he makes the breaths accordant for him.\n\n### v. 3. 3.\n\nWhatever the gods did at the sacrifice the Asuras did. The gods saw these\nAksnayastomiya (bricks), they put them down on one place after reciting in\nanother; the Asuras could not follow it; then the gods prospered, the Asuras\nwere defeated. In that he puts down the Aksnayastomiyas in one place after\nreciting in another, (it is) to overcome foes: he prospers himself, his foe is\ndefeated. 'The swift, the triple', (with these words) he puts down on the\neast; the triple is the beginning of the sacrifice [1]; verily in the east he\nestablishes the beginning of the sacrifice. 'The sky, the seventeenfold ',\n(with these words be puts down) on the south; the sky is food, the\nseventeenfold is food; verily on the south he places food; therefore with the\nright (hand) is food eaten. 'Support, the twenty-onefold', (with these words\nhe puts down) on the west; the twenty-onefold is support; (verily it serves)\nfor support. 'The shining, the fifteenfold', (with these words he puts down)\non the north; the shining is force; verily he places force on the north;\ntherefore he that advances to the north is victorious. 'Speed, the\neighteenfold', (with these words) he puts down on the east [2]; two threefold\nones he establishes in the beginning of the sacrifice in order. 'Attack, the\ntwentyfold', (with these words he puts down) on the south; Attack is food, the\ntwentyfold is food; verily he places food on the south therefore with the\nright is food eaten. 'Radiance, the twenty-twofold', (with these words he puts\ndown) on the west; in that there are twenty, thereby there are two Viraj\nverses; in that there are two there is support; verily in order he finds\nsupport in the Viraj verses and in the eating of food. 'Fervour, the\nnineteenfold', (with these words he puts down) on the north; therefore the\nleft hand [3] has the greater fervour. 'The womb, the twenty-fourfold', (with\nthese words) he puts down on the east; the Gayatri has twenty-four syllables,\nthe beginning of the sacrifice is the Gayatri; verily on the east he\nestablishes the beginning of the sacrifice. 'The embryo, the twenty-fivefold',\n(with these words he puts down) on the south; embryos are food, the twenty-\nfivefold is food; verily he places food on the south; therefore with the right\nis food eaten. 'Force the twenty sevenfold', (with these words he puts down)\non the west; the twenty-seven fold is these worlds; verily he finds support in\nthese worlds. 'Maintenance, the twenty-fourfold', (with these words he puts\ndown) on the north [4]; therefore the left hand is most to be maintained.\n'Inspiration, the thirty-onefold', (with these words) he puts down on the\neast; inspiration is speech, speech is the beginning of the sacrifice; verily\nhe establishes the beginning of the sacrifice on the east. 'The surface of the\ntawny one, the thirty fourfold', (with these words he puts down) on the south;\nthe surface of the tawny one is yonder sun; verily he places splendour on the\nsouth; therefore the right side is the more resplendent. 'Support, the thirty\nthreefold', (with these words he puts down) on the west, for support. 'The\nvault, the thirty-sixfold', (with these words he puts down) on the north'; the\nvault is the world of heaven; (verily it serves) to attain the world of\nheaven.\n\n### v. 3. 4.\n\n'Thou art the portion of Agni', (with these words he puts down) on the east;\nAgni is the beginning of the sacrifice, consecration is the beginning of the\nsacrifice, holy power is the beginning of the sacrifice, the threefold is the\nbeginning of the sacrifice; verily on the east he establishes the beginning of\nthe sacrifice. 'Thou art the portion of them that gaze on men', (with these\nwords he puts down) on the south; those that gaze on men are the learned,\nDhatr is food; verily on birth he gives him food; therefore on birth he eats\nfood. 'The birthplace saved, the seventeenfold Stoma', he says; the birthplace\nis food [1], the seventeen fold is food; verily he places food on the south;\ntherefore with the right food is eaten. 'Thou art the portion of Mitra', (with\nthese words he puts down) on the west; Mitra is expiration, Varuna\ninspiration; verily he confers on him expiration and inspiration. 'The rain\nfrom the sky, the winds saved, the twenty-onefold Stoma', he says; the twenty-\nonefold is support, (verily it serves) for support. 'Thou art the portion of\nIndra', (with these words he puts down) on the north; Indra is force, Visnu,\nis force, the lordly power is force, the fifteenfold is force [2]; verily on\nthe north he places force; therefore he that advances to the north is\nvictorious. 'Thou art the portion of the Vasus', (with these words) he put\ndown on the east; the Vasus are the beginning of the sacrifice, the Rudras are\nthe beginning of the sacrifice, the twenty-fourfold is the beginning of the\nsacrifice; verily on the east he establishes the beginning of the sacrifice.\n'Thou art the portion of the Adityas', (with these words he puts down) on the\nsouth; the Adityas are food, the Maruts are food, embryos are food, the\ntwenty-fivefold is food; verily be places food on the south; therefore with\nthe right food is eaten. 'Thou art the portion of Aditi' [3], (with these\nwords he puts down) on the west; Aditi is support, Pusan is support, the\ntwenty-sevenfold is support; (verily it serves) for support. 'Thou art the\nportion of the god Savitr', (with these words he puts down) on the north; the\ngod Savitr is holy power, Brhaspati is holy power, the fourfold Stoma is holy\npower; verily he places splendour on the north; therefore the northern half is\nmore resplendent. (The verse) contains a word connected with Savitr; (verily\nit serves) for instigation; therefore is their gain produced in the north for\nBrahmans. 'The support, the fourfold Stoma', (with these words) he puts down\non the east; the support is the beginning of the sacrifice [4], the fourfold\nStoma is the beginning of the sacrifice; verily he establishes on the east the\nbeginning of the sacrifice. 'Thou art the portion of the Yavas', (with these\nwords he puts down) on the south; the Yavas' are the months, the Ayavas are\nthe half-months; therefore the months turn to the south; the Yavas are food,\noffspring is food; verily he places food on the south; therefore with the\nright food is eaten. 'Thou art the portion of the Rbhus', (with these words he\nputs down) on the west, for support. 'The revolving, the forty-eightfold',\n(with these words he puts down) on the north, to confer strength on these two\nworlds; therefore these two worlds are of even strength [5]. He becomes first\nfor whom these are placed on the east as the beginning (of the sacrifice), and\nhis son is born to be first; he eats food for whom on the south these (are\nplaced) rich in food, and a son is born to him to eat food; he finds support\nfor whom these (are placed) on the west, full of support; he becomes forcible\nfor whom these (are placed) on the north, full of force, and a forcible son is\nborn to him. The fire is a hymn; I verily in that this arrangement [6] is made\nare its Stotra and \xc3\x87astra produced; verily in the hymn the Arkya (Saman and\n\xc3\x87astra) is produced; he eats food, and his son is born to eat food, for whom\nthis arrangement is made, and he too who knows it thus. He puts down the\ncreating (bricks); verily he wins things as created. Now there was neither day\nnor night in the world, but it was undiscriminated; the gods saw these dawn\n(bricks), they put them down; then did this shine forth; for him for whom\nthese are put down the dawn breaks; verily he smites away the dark.\n\n### v. 3. 5.\n\n'O Agni, drive away those foes of ours that are born', (with these words) he\nputs down on the east; verily he drives away his foes on birth. 'That are born\nwith force', (with these words he puts down) on the west; verily he repels\nthose that are to be born.

'The\nsixteenfold Stoma', (with these words he puts down) on the north; the\nsixteenfold is force; verily he places force on the north; therefore [1] he\nthat advances to the north is victorious. The forty-fourfold is a thunderbolt,\nthe sixteenfold is a thunder bolt; in that he puts down these two bricks, he\nhurls the bolt after the foe born and to be born whom he has repelled, to lay\nthem low. He puts down in the middle (a brick) full of dust, the middle of the\nbody is faeces ( _p urisa_); verily he piles the fire with its own body, and\nwith his own body he is in yonder world who knows thus. These bricks are\ncalled the unrivalled; no rival is his for whom they are put down [2]. The\nfire is an animal; he puts down the Viraj (bricks) in the highest layer;\nverily be confers upon cattle the highest Viraj; therefore he that is\npossessed of cattle speaks the highest speech. Ten by ten he puts (them) down,\nto confer power on them. Transversely he puts (them) down; therefore cattle\nmove their limbs transversely, for support. By those metres which were\nheavenly, the gods went to the world of heaven; for that the seers toiled [3];\nthey practised fervour, these they saw by fervour, and from them they\nfashioned these bricks. 'The course metre; the space metre', (with these\nwords) they put them down; with these they went to the world of heaven; in\nthat he puts down these bricks, the sacrifice goes to the world of heaven with\nthe metres that are heavenly. By the sacrifice Prajapati created creatures; he\ncreated them by the Stomabhagas; in that [4] he puts down the Stomabhagas, the\nsacrificer creates offspring. In the Stomabhagas Brhaspati collected the\nbrilliance of the sacrifice; in that he puts down the Stomabhaga (bricks) he\npiles the fire with its brilliance. 1n the Stomabhagas Brhaspati saw the\nsupport of the sacrifice; in that he puts down the Stomabhagas, (it is) for\nthe support of the sacrifice. Seven by seven he puts down, to confer strength,\nthree in the middle, for support.\n\n### v. 3. 6.\n\n(With the words) 'ray', he created Aditya; with 'advance', right; with\n'following', the sky; with 'union', the atmosphere; with 'propping', the\nearth; with 'prop', the rain; with blowing forward', the day; with 'blowing\nafter', the night; with eager', the Vasus; with 'intelligence', the Rudras;\nwith 'brilliant', the Adityas; with 'force', the Pitrs; with 'thread',\noffspring; with 'enduring the battle', cattle; with 'wealthy', plants. 'Thou\nart the victorious, with ready stone [1]; for Indra thee Quicken Indra', (with\nthese words) he fastened the thunderbolt on his right side, for victory. He\ncreated offspring without expiration; on them he bestowed expiration (with the\nwords) 'Thou art the overlord'; inspiration (with the word) 'Restrainer'; the\neye (with) 'the gliding'; the ear (with) 'the bestower of strength'. Now these\noffspring, though having expiration and inspiration, hearing and seeing, did\nnot couple; upon them he bestowed copulation (with the words) 'Thou art the\nTrivrt'. These offspring though coupling [2] were not propagated; he made them\npropagate (with the words) 'Thou art the mounter, thou art the descender'.\nThese offspring being propagated did not find support; he made them find\nsupport in these worlds (with the words) 'Thou art the wealthy, thou art the\nbrilliant, thou art the gainer of good', verily he makes offspring when\npropagated find support in these worlds, he with his body mounts the\natmosphere, with his expiration he finds support in yonder world, of\nexpiration and inspiration he is not liable to be deprived who knows thus.\n\n### v. 3. 7.\n\nBy the 'sitters on the vault' the gods went to the world of heaven; that is\nwhy the 'sitters on the vault' have their name. In that he puts down the\n'sitters on the vault', the sacrificer thus goes by the 'sitters on the vault'\nto the world of heaven; the vault is the world of heaven; for him for whom\nthese are put down there is no misfortune ( _n a-akam_); the 'sitters on the\nvault' are the home of the sacrificer; in that he puts down the 'sitters on\nthe vault', the sacrificer thus makes himself a home. The 'sitters on the\nvault' are the collected brilliance of the Prstha (Stotras); in that he puts\ndown the 'sitters on the vault' [1], verily he wins the brilliance of the\nPrsthas. He puts down the five crested; verily becoming Apsarases they wait on\nhim in yonder world; verily also they are the bodyguards of the sacrificer. He\nshould think of whomever he hates as he puts (them) down; verily he cuts him\noff for these deities; swiftly he goes to ruin. He puts (them) above the\n'sitters on the vault'; that is as when having taken a wife one seats her in\nthe house [2]; he puts the highest on the west, pointing east; therefore the\nwife attends on the west, facing east. He puts as the highest the naturally\nperforated and the earless (bricks); the naturally perforated is breath, the\nearless is life; verily he places breath and life as the highest of the\nbreaths; therefore are breath and life the highest of the breaths. No brick\nhigher (than these) should he put down; if he were to put another brick\nhigher, he would obstruct the breath and life of cattle [3] and of the\nsacrificer; there fore no other brick should be put down higher. He puts down\nthe naturally perforated brick; the naturally perforated brick is yonder\n(sky); verily he puts down yonder (sky). He makes the horse sniff it; verily\nbe places breath in it; again the horse is connected with Prajapati; verily by\nPrajapati he piles the fire. It is naturally perforated, to let out the\nbreaths, and also to light up the world of heaven. The earless is the triumph\nof the gods; in that he puts down the earless, he triumphs with the triumph of\nthe gods; to the north he puts it down; therefore to the north of the fire is\naction carried on; (the verse) has the word 'wind', for kindling.\n\n### v. 3. 8.\n\nHe puts down the metre bricks; the metres are cattle; verily he wins cattle;\nthe good thing of the gods, cattle, are the metres; verily he wins the good\nthing, cattle. Yaj\xc3\xb1asena Caitriyayana taught this layer; by this he won\ncattle; in that he puts it down, he wins cattle. He puts down the Gayatris on\nthe east; the Gayatri is brilliance; verily at the beginning he places\nbrilliance [1]; they contain the word 'head'; verily he makes him the head of\nhis equals. He puts down the Tristubhs; the Tristubh is power; verily he\nplaces power in the middle He puts down the Jagatis; cattle are connected with\nthe Jagati; verily he wins cattle. He puts down the Anustubhs; the Anustubh is\nbreath; (verily it serves) to let the breaths out. Brhatis, Usnihs, Panktis,\nAksarapanktis, these various metres he puts down; cattle are various, the\nmetres are cattle [2]; verily he wins various cattle; variety is seen in his\nhouse for whom these are put down, and who knows them thus. He puts down an\nAtichandas; all the metres are the Atichandas; verily he piles it with all the\nmetres. The Atichandas is the highest of the metres; in that he puts down an\nAtichandas, be makes him the highest of his equals. He puts down two-footed\n(bricks); the sacrificer has two feet; (verily they serve) for support.\n\n### v. 3. 9.\n\nFor all the gods is the fire piled up; if he were not to put (them) down in\nunison, the gods would divert his fire; in that he puts (them) down in unison,\nverily he piles them in unison with himself; he is not deprived of his fire;\nmoreover, just as man is held together by his sinews, so is the fire held\ntogether by these (bricks). By the fire the gods went to the world of heaven;\nthey became yonder Krttikas; he for whom these are put down goes to the world\nof heaven, attains brilliance, and becomes a resplendent thing. He puts down\nthe circular bricks; the circular bricks are these worlds; the citadels of the\ngods are these worlds; verily he enters the citadels of the gods; he is not\nruined who has piled up the fire. He puts down the all-light (bricks); verily\nby them he makes these worlds full of light; verily also they support the\nbreaths of the sacrificer; they are the deities of heaven; verily grasping\nthem he goes to the world of heaven.\n\n### v. 3. 10.\n\nHe puts down the rain-winning (bricks); verily he wins the rain. If he were to\nput (them) down in one place, it would rain for one season; he puts down after\ncarrying them round in order; therefore it rains all the seasons. 'Thou art\nthe bringer of the east wind', he says; that is the form of rain; verily by\nits form he wins rain. With the Samyanis the gods went ( _s am ayus_) to these\nworlds; that is why the Samyanis have their name; in that he puts down the\nSamyanis, just as one goes in the waters with a ship, so [1] the sacrificer\nwith them goes to these worlds. The Samyanis are the ship of the fire; in that\nhe puts down the Samyanis, verily he puts down a boat for the fire; moreover,\nwhen these have been put down, if the waters strive to drag away his fire,\nverily it remains unmoved. He puts down the Aditya bricks; it is the Adityas\nwho repel from prosperity him who being fit for prosperity does not obtain\nprosperity; verily the Adityas [2] make him attain prosperity. It is yonder\nAditya who takes away the brilliance of him who having piled up a fire does\nnot display splendour; in that he puts down the Aditya bricks, yonder sun\nconfers radiance upon him; just as yonder sun is radiant, so he is radiant\namong men. He puts down ghee bricks; the ghee is the home dear to Agni; verily\nhe unites him with his dear home [3], and also with brilliance. He places\n(them) after carrying (them) round; verily he confers upon him brilliance not\nto be removed. Prajapati piled up the fire, he lost his glory, he saw these\nbestowers of glory, he put them down; verily with them he conferred glory upon\nhimself; five he puts down; man is fivefold; verily he confers glory on the\nwhole extent of man.\n\n### v. 3. 11.\n\nThe gods and the Asuras were in conflict; the gods were the fewer, the Asuras\nthe more; the gods saw these bricks, they put them down; 'Thou art the\nfurtherer', (with these words) they became multiplied with the trees, the\nplants; (with) 'Thou art the maker of wide room', they conquered this (earth);\n(with) 'Thou art the eastern', they conquered the eastern quarter; (with)\n'Thou art the zenith', they conquered yonder (sky); (with) 'Thou art the\nsitter on the atmosphere; sit on the atmosphere', they conquered the\natmosphere; then the gods prospered [1], the Asuras were defeated. He for whom\nthose are put down becomes greater, conquers these worlds, and prospers\nhimself; his foe is defeated. 'Thou art the sitter on the waters; thou art the\nsitter on the hawk', he says; that is the form of Agni; verily by his form he\nwins Agni. 'In the wealth of earth I place thee', he says; verily with these\n(bricks) he makes these worlds wealthy. He puts down the life-giving (bricks);\nverily he bestows life upon him [2]. 'O Agni, thy highest name, the heart', he\nsays; that is the home dear to Agni; verily he obtains his dear home. 'Come,\nlet us join together', he says; verily with him to aid he encircles him. 'Be\nthou, O Agni, among those of the five races.' The fire of the five layers is\nthe fire of the five races; therefore he speaks thus. He puts down the\nseasonal (bricks); the seasonal (bricks) are the abode dear to the seasons;\nverily he wins the abode dear to the seasons. 'The firm one', he says; the\nfirm one is the year; verily he obtains the abode dear to the year.\n\n_\n\nThe Horse Sacrifice (continued)\n\n_\n\n### v. 3. 12.\n\nThe eye of Prajapati swelled, that fell away, that became a horse; because it\nswelled ( _a \xc3\xa7vayat_), that is the reason why the horse ( _a \xc3\xa7va_) has its\nname. By the horse sacrifice the gods replaced it. He who sacrifices with the\nhorse sacrifice makes Prajapati whole; verily he becomes whole; this is the\natonement for everything, and the cure for everything. All evil by it the gods\novercame; by it also the gods overcame (the sins of) Brahman- slaying; all\nevil [1] he overcomes, he overcomes Brahman-slaying who sacrifices with the\nhorse sacrifice, and he who knows it thus. It was the left eye of Prajapati\nthat swelled; therefore they cut off from the horse on the left side, on the\nright from other animals. The mat is of reeds; the horse has its birthplace in\nthe waters, the reed is born in the waters; verily he establishes it in its\nown birthplace. The Stoma is the fourfold one; the bee tore the thigh of the\nhorse, the gods made it whole with the fourfold Stoma; in that there is the\nfourfold Stoma, (it is) to make whole the horse.\n\n## PRAPATHAKA IV\n\n_\n\nThe Piling of the Fire Altar (continued)\n\n_\n\n### v. 4. 1.\n\nThe gods and the Asuras were in conflict, they could not decide the issue;\nIndra saw these bodies, he put them down; with them he conferred upon himself\npower, strength, and body; then the gods prospered, the Asuras were defeated.\nIn that he puts down Indra's bodies, the sacrificer with them bestows on\nhimself power, strength, and body; verily also he piles up the fire with Indra\nand with a body; be prospers himself, his foe is [1] defeated. The sacrifice\ndeparted from the gods; they could not recover it; they saw these bodies of\nthe sacrifice, they put them down, and by them they recovered the sacrifice.\nIn that he puts down the bodies of the sacrifice, the sacrificer by them wins\nthe sacrifice. Three and thirty he puts down; the gods are three and thirty;\nverily he wins the gods; verily also he piles up the fire with itself and with\na body; he becomes with his body in yonder world [2], who knows thus. He puts\ndown the lighted (bricks); verily he confers light upon it; the fire blazes\npiled up with these (bricks); verily with them he kindles it; in both worlds\nis there light for him. He puts down the constellation bricks; these are the\nlights of the sky; verily he wins them; the Naksatras are the lights of the\ndoers of good deeds; verily he wins them; verily also he makes these lights\ninto a reflection [3] to light up the world of heaven. If he were to place\nthem in contact, he would obstruct the world of rain, Parjanya would not rain;\nhe puts them down without touching; verily he produces the world of rain,\nParjanya is likely to rain; on the east he puts down some pointing west, on\nthe west some pointing east; therefore the constellations move both west and\neast.\n\n### v. 4. 2.\n\nHe puts down the seasonal (bricks), to arrange the seasons. He puts down a\npair; therefore the seasons are in pairs. This middle layer is as it were\nunsupported; it is as it were the atmosphere; he puts down a pair on the other\nlayers, but four in the middle one, for support. The seasonal (bricks) are the\ninternal cement of the layers; in that he puts down the seasonal (bricks), (it\nis) to keep apart the layers. He puts down next an Avaka plant; this is the\nbirthplace of Agni; verily he piles up the fire with its birthplace [1].\nVi\xc3\xa7vamitra says, 'He shall eat food with holy power, for whom these shall be\nput down, and he who shall know them thus'. It is the year which repels from\nsupport him who having piled up the fire does not find support; there are five\nlayers preceding, and then he piles up the sixth; the year has six seasons;\nverily in the seasons the year finds support. These are the bricks [2], called\nthe over-ladies; he for whom they are put down becomes the overlord of his\nequals; he should think of him whom he hates as he puts (them down); verily he\ncuts him off for those deities; swiftly he goes to ruin. The Angirases, going\nto the world of heaven, made over to the seers the accomplishment of the\nsacrifice; it became gold; in that he anoints with fragments of gold, (it is)\nfor the completion of the sacrifice; verily also he makes healing for it [3];\nmoreover he unites it with its form, and with golden light he goes to the\nworld of heaven. He anoints with that which contains the word 'of a thousand';\nPrajapati is of a thousand; (verily it serves) to win Prajapati. 'May these\nbricks, O Agni, be for me milch cows', he says; verily he makes them milch\ncows; they, milking desires, wait upon him yonder in yonder world.\n\n### v. 4. 3.\n\nThe fire is Rudra; he is born then when he is completely piled up; just as a\ncalf on birth desires the teat, so he here seeks his portion; if he were not\nto offer a libation to him, he would suck the Adhvaryu and the sacrificer. He\noffers the \xc3\x87atarudriya (oblation); verily he appeases him with his own\nportion; neither Adhvaryu nor sacrificer goes to ruin. If he were to offer\nwith the milk of domesticated animals [1], he would afflict domestic animals\nwith pain; if (with that) of wild (animals), wild (animals); he should offer\nwith groats of wild sesame or with groats of Gavidhuka grass; he harms neither\ndomesticated nor wild animals. Then they say, 'Wild sesame and Gavidhuka grass\nare not a proper offering'; he offers with goat's milk, the female goat is\nconnected with Agni; verily he offers with a proper offering; he harms neither\ndomesticated nor wild animals. The Angirases going to the world of heaven [2]\nspilled the cauldron on the goat; she in pain dropped a feather (like hair),\nit became the Arka (plant); that is why the Arka has its name. He offers with\na leaf of the Arka, to unite it with its birthplace. He offers standing facing\nnorth; this is the quarter of Rudra; verily he propitiates him in his own\nquarter. He offers on the last brick; verily at the end he propitiates Rudra.\nHe offers dividing it into three; these worlds are three; verily he makes\nthese worlds of even strength; at this height he offers [3], then at this,\nthen at this; these worlds are three; verily he appeases him for these worlds.\nThree further libations he offers; they make up six, the seasons are six;\nverily with the seasons he appeases him. If he were to offer while wandering\nround, he would make Rudra come within (the sacrifice). Or rather they say,\n'In what quarter is Rudra or in what?' He should offer them while wandering\nround; verily he appeases him completely [4]. The highest (bricks) are the\nheavenly deities; over them he makes the sacrificer speak; verily by them he\nmakes him attain the world of heaven; he should throw (the leaf) down in the\npath of the cattle of him whom he hates; the first beast that steps upon it\ngoes to ruin.\n\n### v. 4. 4.\n\n'The strength on the stone', (with these words) he moistens (the fire), and so\npurifies it; verily also he delights it; it delighted attends him, causing him\nneither hunger nor pain in yonder world; he rejoices in offspring, in cattle\nwho knows thus. 'That food and strength, do ye, O Maruts, bounteously bestow\non us', he says; strength is food, the Maruts are food; verily he wins food.\n'In the stone is thy hunger; let thy pain reach N.N. [1], whom we hate', he\nsays; verily he afflicts him whom he hates with its hunger and pain. He goes\nround thrice, moistening; the fire is threefold; verily he calms the pain of\nthe whole extent of the fire. Thrice again he goes round; they make up six,\nthe seasons are six; verily with the seasons he calms its pain. The reed is\nthe flower of the waters, the Avaka is the cream of the waters [2]; he draws\nover (it) with a branch of reeds and with Avaka plants; the waters are\nappeased; verily with them appeased he calms his pain. The beast that first\nsteps over the fire when piled, it is liable to burn it up with its heat. He\ndraws over (it) with a frog; this of animals is the one on which one does not\nsubsist, for neither among the domesticated nor the wild beasts has it a\nplace; verily he afflicts it with pain. With eight (verses) he draws across\n[3]; the Gayatri has eight syllables, the fire is connected with the Gayatri;\nverily he calms the pain of the whole extent of the fire. (He draws) with\n(verses) containing (the word) 'purifying', the purifying (one) is food;\nverily by food he calms its pain. The fire is death; the black antelope skin\nis the form of holy power; he puts on a pair of black sandals; verily by the\nholy power he shuts himself away from death. 'He shuts himself away from\ndeath, and away from eating food', they say; one he puts on, the other not;\nverily he shuts himself away [4] from death and wins the eating of food.\n'Honour to thy heat, thy blaze', he says, for paying honour they wait on a\nricher man; 'may thy bolts afflict another than us', he says; verily him whom\nhe hates he afflicts with its pain; 'be thou purifying and auspicious to us',\nhe says; the purifying (one) is food; verily he wins food. With two (verses)\nhe strides over (it), for support; (with two) containing (the word) 'water',\nfor soothing.\n\n### v. 4. 5.\n\n'To him that sits in man hail!' (with these words) he pours butter on; verily\nwith the Pankti and the offering he takes hold of the beginning of the\nsacrifice. He pours on butter transversely; therefore animals move their limbs\ntransversely, for support. If he were to utter the Vasat cry, his Vasat cry\nwould be exhausted; if he were not to utter the Vasat cry, the Raksases would\ndestroy the sacrifice; Vat he says; verily, mysteriously he utters the Vasat\ncry; his Vasat, cry is not exhausted, the Raksases do not destroy the\nsacrifice. Some of the gods eat the offerings [1], others do not; verily he\ndelights both sets by piling up the fire. 'Those gods among gods', (with these\nwords) he anoints (it) with curds mixed with honey; verily the sacrificer\ndelights the gods who eat and those who do not eat the offerings; they delight\nthe sacrificer. He delights those who eat the offerings with curds, and those\nwho do not with honey; curds is a food of the village, honey of the wild; in\nthat he anoints with curds mixed with honey, (it serves) to win both. He\nanoints with a large handful (of grass); the large handful is connected with\nPrajapati [2]; (verily it serves) to unite it with its birthplace; with two\n(verses) he anoints, for support. He anoints going round in order; verily he\ndelights them completely. Now he is deprived of the breaths, of offspring, of\ncattle who piling the fire steps upon it. 'Giver of expiration art thou, of\ninspiration', he says; verily he bestows on himself the breaths; 'giver of\nsplendour, giver of wide room', he says; splendour is offspring; wide room is\ncattle; verily he bestows on himself offspring and cattle. Indra slew Vrtra;\nhim Vrtra [3] slain grasped with sixteen coils; he saw this libation to Agni\nof the front; he offered it, and Agni of the front, being delighted with his\nown portion, burnt in sixteen places the coils of Vrtra; by the offspring to\nVi\xc3\xa7vakarman he was set free from evil; in that he offers a libation to Agni of\nthe front, Agni of the front, delighted with his own portion, burns away his\nevil, and he is set free from his evil by the offering to Vi\xc3\xa7vakarman. If he\ndesire of a man, 'May he be set free slowly from evil' [4], he should offer\none by one for him; verily, slowly he is set free from evil; if he desire of a\nman, 'Swiftly may he be set free from evil', he should run over all of them\nfor him and make one offering; swiftly is he set free from evil. Or rather he\nsacrifices separately with each hymn; verily severally he places strength in\nthe two hymns; (verily they serve) for support.\n\n### v. 4. 6.\n\n'Do thou lead him forward', (with these words) he puts on the kindling-sticks;\nthat is as when one provides hospitality for one who has come on a visit. He\nputs down three; the fire is threefold; verily he provides his portion for the\nwhole extent of the fire. They are of Udumbara wood, the Udumbara is strength;\nverily he gives him strength. 'May the All-gods thee', he says; the All-gods\nare the breaths; verily with the breaths [1] he raises him up; I bear up with\ntheir thoughts, O Agni', he says; verily he unites him with the thought for\nwhich he lifts him up. 'May the five regions divine aid the sacrifice, the\ngoddesses', he says, for he moves forward along the quarters. 'Driving away\npoverty and hostility', he says, for smiting away the Raksases. 'Giving to the\nlord of the sacrifice increase of wealth,' he says; increase of wealth is\ncattle [2]; verily he wins cattle. He takes (him) with six (verses); the\nseasons are six; verily with the seasons he takes him; two have (the word)\n'embracing', for the smiting away of the Raksases. 'With the rays of the sun,\nwith tawny hair, before us', he says, for instigation. 'Then let our pure\ninvocations be accepted', he says; the pure (one) is food; verily he wins\nfood. The gods and the Asuras were in conflict; the gods saw the unassailable\n(hymn) and with it they conquered the Asuras [3]; that is why the unassailable\n(hymn) has its name. In that the second Hotr recites the unassailable (hymn)\nthe sacrificer conquers his foes therewith unassailably; verily also he\nconquers what has not been conquered. (The hymn) has ten verses; the Viraj has\nten syllables, by the Viraj are kept apart these two worlds; (verily it\nserves) to keep apart these two worlds. Again the Viraj has ten syllables, the\nViraj is food; verily he finds support in the Viraj, in eating food. The\natmosphere is as it were unreal; the Agnidh's altar is as it were the\natmosphere; on the Agnidh's altar [4] he puts down a stone, for reality; with\ntwo (verses), for support. 'As measurer, he standeth in the midst of the sky',\nhe says; verily with this he measures; 'in the middle of the sky is the\ndappled stone set down', he says; the dappled is food; verily he wins food.\nWith four (verses) he goes up to the tail; the metres are four; verily (he\ngoes) with the metres. 'All have caused Indra to wax', he says; verily he\nattains increase. 'True lord and lord of strength' [5], he says; strength is\nfood; verily he wins food. 'Let the sacrifice invoke favour, and bring the\ngods', he says; favour is offspring and cattle; verily be bestows on himself\noffspring and cattle. 'Let the god, Agni, offer and bring to us the gods', he\nsays, to make the cry, Godspeed! 'He hath seized me with the impulse of\nstrength, with 'elevation', he says; elevation is yonder sun in rising;\ndepression is it when setting; verily with holy power he elevates himself,\nwith holy power he depresses his foe.\n\n### v. 4. 7.\n\n'Along the eastern quarter do thou advance, wise one', he says; verily with\nthis (verse) he moves to the world of heaven. 'Mount ye, with Agni, to the\nvault', he says; verily with this he mounts these worlds. 'From earth have I\nmounted to the atmosphere,' he says; verily with it he mounts these worlds.\n'Going to the heaven they look not away', he says; verily he goes to the world\nof heaven. 'O Agni, advance [1] first of worshippers', he says; verily with it\nhe bestows eyesight upon both gods and men. He steps upon (the altar) with\nfive (verses); the sacrifice is fivefold; verily he goes to the world of\nheaven with the full extent of the sacrifice. 'Night and dawn', he recites as\nthe Puronuvakya, for preparation. O Agni, of a thousand eyes', he says;\nPrajapati is of a thousand; (verily it serves) to obtain Prajapati. 'To thee\nas such let us pay honour; to strength hail!' he says; strength is food;\nverily he wins food [2]. He offers on the naturally perforated brick (a ladle)\nof Udumbara wood filled with curds; curds are strength, the Udumbara is\nstrength, the naturally perforated is yonder (sky); verily he places strength\nin yonder (sky); therefore we live on strength coming hitherward from yonder.\nHe puts (it) in place with three (verses); the fire is threefold; verily be\nmakes the whole extent of the fire attain support. 'Enkindled, O Agni, shine\nbefore us', (with these words) he takes (the kindling-stick) of Udumbara wood;\nthis is a pipe with projections; by it [3] the gods made piercings of hundreds\nof the Asuras; in that he takes up the kindling-stick with this (verse), the\nsacrificer hurls the hundred-slaying (verse) as a bolt at his enemy, to lay\nhim low without fail. 'Let us pay homage to thee in thy highest birth, O Agni\n', (with these words) he takes up (the kindling-stick) of Vikankata wood;\nverily he wins radiance. 'That various of Savitr, the adorable', (with these\nwords) be takes up (the kindling-stick) of \xc3\x87ami wood, for soothing. The fire\nmilks the piler-up of the fire; the piler-up, milks the fire; 'that [4]\nvarious of Savitr, the adorable', he says; this is the milking of the fire.\nThis of it Kanva \xc3\x87rayasa knew, and with it he was wont to milk it; in that be\ntakes up the kindling-stick with the verse, the piler-up of the fire milks the\nfire. 'Seven are thy kindling-sticks, O Agni, seven tongues'; verily he\ndelights seven sevens of his. With a full (ladle) he offers, for Prajapati is\nas it were full, to obtain Prajapati [5]. He offers with a half-filled\n(ladle), for from the half-filled Prajapati created creatures, for the\ncreation of offspring. Agni departed from the gods; he entered the quarters;\nhe who sacrifices should think in his mind of the quarters; verily from the\nquarters he wins him; with curds he offers at first, with butter afterwards;\nverily he bestows upon him brilliance and power in accord. There is (an\noffering) to Vai\xc3\xa7vanara on twelve potsherds; the year has twelve months, Agni\nVai\xc3\xa7vanara is the year; verily straightway [6] he wins Vai\xc3\xa7vanara. If he were\nto offer the fore- and after-sacrifices, there would be a bursting of the\nsacrifice; he offers an oblation with a ladle, for the support of the\nsacrifice. Vai\xc3\xa7vanara is the kingly power, the Maruts the people; having\noffered the offering to Vai\xc3\xa7vanara, he offers those to the Maruts; verily he\nattaches the people to the kingly power. He utters aloud (the direction to the\nAgnidh) for Vai\xc3\xa7vanara, he offers the offerings of the Maruts muttering;\ntherefore the kingly power speaks above the people. (The offerings) are for\nthe Maruts; the people of the gods are the Maruts; verily he wins for him by\nthe people of the gods the people among men. There are seven; the Maruts are\nin seven troops; verily in troops he wins the people for him; running over\ntroop by troop he offers; verily he makes the people obedient to him.\n\n### v. 4. 8.\n\nHe offers the stream of wealth; 'May a stream of wealth be mine', (with this\nhope) is the offering made; this stream of ghee waits upon him in yonder\nworld, swelling up. He offers with butter; butter is brilliance, the stream of\nwealth is brilliance; verily by brilliance he wins brilliance for him. Again\nthe stream of wealth is desires; verily he wins desires. If he desire of a\nman, 'May I separate his breaths and his eating of food' [1], he should offer\nseparately for him; verily he separates his breaths and his eating of food; if\nhe desire of a man, 'May I continue his breaths and his eating of food', he\nshould offer for him in a continuous stream; verily he continues his breaths\nand his eating of food. Twelve sets of twelve he offers; the year has twelve\nmonths; verily by the year he wins food for him. 'May for me food, for me\nfreedom from hunger', he says; that [2] is the form of food; verily he wins\nfood. 'May for me fire, for me the waters', be says; this is the birthplace of\nfood; verily he wins food with its birthplace. He offers those where Indra, is\nhalf; verily he wins the deities; since Indra is half of all and a match,\ntherefore Indra is the most appropriating of gods; he says Indra later; verily\nhe places strength in him at the top. He offers the weapons of the sacrifice;\nthe weapons of the sacrifice are the sacrifice [3]; verily he wins the\nsacrifice. Again this is the form of the sacrifice; verily he wins the\nsacrifice by its form. 'May for me the final bath and the cry of Godspeed!' he\nsays, to utter Godspeed! 'May the fire for me, the cauldron', he says; that is\nthe form of splendour; verily by the form he wins splendour. 'May the Rc for\nme, the Saman', he says [4]; that is the form of the metres; verily by the\nform he wins the metres. 'May the embryo for me, the calves', he says; that is\nthe form of cattle; verily by the form he wins cattle. He offers the orderers,\nto order the disordered. He offers the even and the odd, for pairing; they are\nin ascending ratio, for ascent. 'May one for me, three', he says; one and\nthree are the metres of the gods [51, four and eight the metres of men; verily\nhe wins both the metres of gods and men. Up to thirty-three he offers; the\ngods are three and thirty; verily he wins the gods; up to forty-eight he\noffers, the Jagati has forty eight syllables, cattle are connected with the\nJagati: verily by the Jagati he wins cattle for him. 'Strength, instigation',\n(with these words) he offers a set of twelve; the year has twelve months;\nverily he finds support in the year.\n\n### v. 4. 9.\n\nAgni departed from the gods, desiring a portion; the gods said to him, 'come\nback to us, carry the oblation for us.' He said, 'Let me choose a born; let\nthem offer to me the Vajaprasaviya'; therefore to Agni they offer the\nVajaprasaviya. In that he offers the Vajaprasaviya, he unites Agni with his\nown portion; verily also this is his consecration. He offers with fourteen\n(verses); there are seven domesticated, seven wild [ 1] animals; (verily it\nserves) to win both sets. He offers of every kind of food, to win every kind\nof food. He offers with an offering-spoon of Udumbara wood; the Udumbara is\nstrength, food is strength; verily by strength he wins for him strength and\nfood. Agni is the consecrated of gods, the piler of the fire of men; therefore\nwhen it rains a piler of the fire should not run, for he has thus obtained\nfood; rain is as it were food; if he were to run he would be running from\nfood. He should go up to it; verily be goes up -to food [2]. 'Night and dawn',\n(with these words) he offers with the milk of a black cow with a white calf;\nverily by the day he bestows night upon him, by night day; verily day and\nnight being bestowed upon him milk his desire and the eating of food. He\noffers the supporters of the kingly power; verily he wins the kingdom. He\noffers with six (verses); the seasons are six; verily he finds support in the\nseasons. 'O lord of the world', (with these words) he offers five libations at\nthe chariot mouth; the chariot is a thunderbolt; verily with the thunderbolt\nhe conquers the quarters [3]. In yonder world the wind blows over the piler of\nthe fire; he offers the names of the winds; verily over him in yonder world\nthe wind blows; three he offers, these worlds are three; verily from these\nworlds he wins the wind. 'Thou art the ocean, full of mist', he says; that is\nthe form of the wind; verily by the form he wins the wind. He offers with his\nclasped hands, for not other wise can the oblation of these be accomplished.\n\n### v. 4. 10.\n\nThe chariot of the gods is yoked for the world of heaven, the chariot of man\nfor wherever his intention is fixed; the fire is the chariot of the gods.\n'Agni I yoke with glory, with ghee', he says; verily he yokes him; he, yoked,\ncarries him to the world of heaven. If he were to yoke with all five together,\nhis fire yoked would fall away, the libations would be without support, the\nStomas without support, the hymns without support. He strokes (the fire) with\nthree (verses) at the morning pressing; the fire is threefold [1]; verily he\nyokes the full extent of the fire; that is as when something is placed on a\nyoked cart; the oblations find support, the Stomas find support, the hymns\nfind support. He strokes with two (verses) in the Stotra of the Yaj\xc3\xb1ayaj\xc3\xb1iya;\nthe sacrifice is as great as is the Agnistoma; a further extension is\nperformed over and above it; verily he mounts at the end the whole extent of\nthe sacrifice. (He strokes) with two (verses), for support; when it is not\ncompleted by one (verse), then [2] does he stroke; the rest of the sacrifice\nresorts to him; (verily it serves) for continuity. He who piles up the fire\nfalls away from this world; his libation cannot be performed in a place\nwithout bricks; whatever libation he offers in a place without bricks, it runs\naway, and with its running away the sacrifice is ruined, with the sacrifice\nthe sacrificer; in that he piles up a second piling, (it is) to support the\nlibations; the libations find support [3], the sacrifice is not ruined, nor\nthe sacrificer. He puts down eight; the Gayatri has eight syllables; verily he\npiles it with the Gayatri metre; if eleven, with the Tristubh, if twelve with\nthe Jagati verily he piles it with the metres. The fire that is re-piled is\ncalled the descendant; he who knowing thus re-piles the fire eats food up to\nthe third generation. The re-piling is like the re-establishment of the fire;\nhe who does not succeed through the establishment of the fire [4] re-\nestablishes it; he who does not succeed by the piling up of the fire re-piles\nit. In that he piles up the fire, (it is) for prosperity. Or rather they say,\n'one should not pile it up.' The fire is Rudra, and it is as if one stirs up a\nsleeping lion. But again they say, 'One should pile it up.' It is as if one\nawakens a richer man with his due portion. Manu piled the fire; with it he did\nnot prosper; he saw this re-piling, he piled it, with it he prospered; in that\nhe piles the re-piling, (it is) for prosperity.\n\n### v. 4. 11.\n\nHe who desires cattle should pile a piling with the metres; the metres are\ncattle; verily he becomes rich in cattle. He should pile in hawk shape who\ndesires the sky; the hawk is the best flier among birds; verily becoming a\nhawk he flies to the world of heaven. He should pile in heron form who\ndesires, 'May I be possessed of a head in yonder world'; verily he becomes\npossessed of a head in yonder world. He should pile in the form of an Alaja\nbird, with four furrows, who desires support; there are four quarters; verily\nhe finds support in the quarters. He should pile in the form of a triangle,\nwho has foes [1]; verily he repels his foes. He should pile in triangle form\non both sides, who desires, 'May I repel the foes I have and those I shall\nhave'; verily he repels the foes he has and those he will have. He should pile\nin the form of a chariot wheel, who has foes; the chariot is a thunderbolt;\nverily he hurls the thunderbolt at his foes. He should pile in the form of a\nwooden trough who desires food; in a wooden trough food is kept; verily he\nwins food together with its place of birth. He should pile one that has to be\ncollected together, who desires cattle; verily he becomes rich in cattle [2].\nHe should pile one in a circle, who desires a village; verily he becomes\npossessed of a village. He should pile in the form of a cemetery, who desires,\n'May I be successful in the world of the fathers'; verily he is successful in\nthe world of the fathers. Vi\xc3\xa7vamitra and Jamadagni had a feud with Vasistha;\nJamadagni saw these Vihavya (bricks); he put them down, and with them he\nappropriated the power and strength of Vasistha; in that he puts down the\nVihavyas, the sacrificer with them appropriates the power and strength of his\nfoe. He puts down on the altar of the Hotr; the Hotr is the abode of the\nsacrificer [3]; verily in his abode he wins for him power and strength. Twelve\nhe puts down; the Jagati has twelve syllables, cattle are connected with the\nJagati; verily with the Jagati he wins cattle for him. Eight each he puts down\nin the other altars; cattle have eight half-hooves; verily he wins cattle. (He\nputs down) six on the Marjaliya; the seasons are six, the gods, the fathers,\nare the seasons; verily he delights the seasons, the gods, the fathers.\n\n_\n\nThe Horse Sacrifice (continued)\n\n_\n\n### v. 4. 12.\n\n'Be 'pure for the winning of strength', this is the Anustubh strophe; three\nAnustubhs make four Gayatris; in that there are three Anustubhs, therefore the\nhorse when standing stands on three feet; in that there are four Gayatri is,\ntherefore he goes putting down all four feet. The Anustubh is the highest of\nmetres, the fourfold Stoma is the highest of Stomas, the three-night sacrifice\nthe highest of sacrifices, the horse the highest of animals; verily by the\nhighest he makes him go to the highest state. It is the twenty-onefold day\n[1], on which the horse is slain, there are twelve months, five seasons; these\nworlds are three; the twenty-onefold (Stoma) is yonder sun; this is Prajapati,\nthe horse is connected with Prajapati; verily he wins it straightway. The\nPrstha (Stotra) is of \xc3\x87akvari verses to make the horse complete, there are\nvarious metres, different sets of animals are offered, both domesticated and\nwild; in that the Prstha is of \xc3\x87akvari verses, (it is) to complete the horse.\nThe Saman of the Brahman is that of Prthura\xc3\xa7mi; by the rein the horse is\nrestrained [2], a horse unrestrained and unsupported is liable to go to the\nfurthest distance; (verily it serves) to restrain and support the horse. The\nAchavaka's Saman is the Samkrti; the horse sacrifice is an extensive\nsacrifice; 'who knows', they say, 'if all of it is done or not?' In that the\nAchavaka's Saman is the Samkrti, (it serves) to make the horse whole, to win\nit entirely, to prevent interference. The last day is an Atiratra with all the\nStomas, to obtain all, to conquer all; verily he obtains all, he conquers all\nwith it.\n\n## PRAPATHAKA V\n\n_\n\nThe Piling of the Fire Altar (continued)\n\n_\n\n### v. 5. 1.\n\nIn that he completes (the sacrifice) with one animal, (it is) for the\ncontinuity of the sacrifice and to avoid cutting it in two. The male animals\nbelong to Indra; in that being Indra's they are offered to the fires, he\ncauses strife among the deities. He should use Tristubh verses, appertaining\nto Agni, for the Yajyas and Anuvakyas; in that they appertain to Agni, (the\nverses) are Agni's, in that they are Tristubhs (they are) Indra's; (verily\nthey serve) for prosperity; he does not cause strife among the deities. To\nVayu of the team he offers a hornless (animal); Vayu is the brilliance of\nAgni; it is offered to brilliance; therefore wheresoever the wind [1] blows,\nthe fire burns; verily it follows its own brilliance. If he were not to offer\nto him of the team, the sacrificer would go mad; (an offering) is made to him\nof the team, to prevent the sacrificer going mad. The Yajya and the Anuvakya,\ncontain (the words) 'wind' and 'white', to secure brilliance. 'The golden germ\nfirst arose', (with these words) he pours out the butter portion; the golden\ngerm is Prajapati; (verily it serves) for likeness to Prajapati. This (animal)\nis slain to make up all forms of animals; its hairs are [2] the form of man,\nits lack of horns that of horses, the possession of one set of incisors only\nthat of cows, the sheep-like hooves that of sheep, that it is a goat, that is\nthe form of goats. The wind is the abode dear to cattle; in that it is offered\nto Vayu, in accord cattle wait upon him. 'Should an animal be offered to Vayu,\nor to Prajapati?' they say; if he were to offer it to Vayu, he would depart\nfrom Prajapati; if he were to offer it to Prajapati, he would depart from Vayu\n[3]; in that the animal is offered to Vayu, therefore he does not depart; in\nthat a cake is offered to Prajapati, therefore he does not depart from\nPrajapati; in that it is offered on twelve potsherds, therefore he does not\ndepart from Vai\xc3\xa7vanara. When about to consecrate himself, he offers to Agni\nand Visnu on eleven potsherds; all the deities are Agni; the sacrifice is\nVisnu; verily he lays hold of the deities and the sacrifice; Agni is the\nlowest of the deities, Visnu the highest; in that he offers to Agni and Visnu\non eleven potsherds, the sacrificer envelops the gods [4] on both sides and\nwins them. By the cake the gods prospered in yonder world, by the oblation in\nthis; he who desires, 'May I prosper in yonder world', should offer a cake;\nverily he prospers in yonder world. In that it is offered on eight pot sherds,\nit is connected with Agni, in that it is offered on three potsherds, it is\nconnected with Visnu; (verily it serves) for prosperity. He who desires, 'May\nI prosper in the world', should offer an oblation; the ghee belongs to Agni,\nthe rice grains to Visnu, therefore [5] an oblation should be offered; verily\nhe prospers in this world. It is (an offering) to Aditi; Aditi is this\n(earth); verily he finds support in this (earth); verily also be extends the\nsacrifice over this. He who piles the fire without keeping it in the pan for a\nyear-(it is with him) as when an embryo is dropped prematurely would go to\nruin; he should offer before (the others) on twelve potsherds to Vai\xc3\xa7vanara;\nAgni Vai\xc3\xa7vanara is the year; even as (an embryo) attaining a year's growth [61\nis born when the due season' is come, so he having obtained the year when the\ndue season is come, piles the fire; he goes not to ruin. Vai\xc3\xa7vanara is the\nform dear to Agni; verily he wins the form dear to him. These offerings are\nthree; these worlds are three; (verily they serve) for the mounting of these\nworlds.\n\n### v. 5. 2.\n\nPrajapati after creating creatures in affection entered into them; from them\nhe could not emerge; he said, 'He shall prosper who shall pile me again\nhence.' The gods piled him; then they prospered; in that they piled him, that\nis why the piling has its name. He who knowing thus piles the fire is\nprosperous. 'For what good is the fire piled?' they say. 'May I be possessed\nof the fire' [1], (with this aim) is the fire piled; verily be becomes\npossessed of the fire. 'For what good is the fire piled?' they say. 'May the\ngods know me', (with this hope) is the fire piled; the gods know him. 'For\nwhat good is the fire piled?' they say. 'May I have a house', (with this hope)\nis the fire piled; verily he becomes possessed of a house. 'For what good is\nthe fire piled?' they say. 'May I be rich in cattle', (with this hope) is the\nfire [2] piled; verily he becomes rich in cattle. 'For what good is the fire\npiled?' they say. 'May the seven men live upon me', (with this hope) is the\nfire piled; three before, three behind, the self the seventh; so many live\nupon him in yonder world. Prajapati desired to pile the fire; to him spake\nearth; 'Thou shalt not pile the fire on me; thou wilt burn me excessively, and\nI being burned excessively will shake you apart [3]; thou wilt fall into a\nsorry state.' He replied, 'So shall I act that it will not burn thee\nexcessively.' He stroked it, (saying), 'May Prajapati seat thee; with that\ndeity, in the manner of Angiras, do thou sit firm'; verily making this a brick\nhe put it down, to prevent excessive burning. That on which he is to pile the\nfire he should stroke, (saying), 'May Prajapati seat thee; with that deity in\nthe manner of Angiras, do thou sit firm' [4]; verily making this a brick he\nsets it down to prevent excessive burning. Prajapati desired, 'Let me be\npropagated', he saw this (fire) in the pan, he bore it for a year, then was he\npropagated. Therefore for a year must it be borne, then is he propagated. To\nhim the Vasus said, 'Thou hast been propagated; let us be propagated.' He gave\nit to the Vasus, they bore it for three days, thereby [5] they created three\nhundred, three and thirty; therefore should it be borne for three days; verily\nis he propagated. To them the Rudras said, 'Ye have been propagated, let us be\npropagated.' They gave it to the Rudras; they bore it for six days, thereby\nthey created three hundred, three and thirty; therefore should it be borne for\nsix days; verily is he propagated. To them the Adityas said, 'Ye have been\npropagated; let us [6] be propagated'. They gave it to the Adityas, they bore\nit for twelve days, thereby they created three hundred, three and thirty;\ntherefore should it be borne for twelve days; verily is he propagated. Thereby\nthey created a thousand, the pan being the thousandth; he who knows thus the\npan as the thousandth obtains a thousand cattle.\n\n### v. 5. 3.\n\n'With a Yajus it is made, with a Yajus it is cooked, with a Yajus it is set\nloose, this pan; it is therefore exhausted, it cannot be used again', they\nsay. 'O Agni, yoke thy (steeds)', 'Yoke them that best invoke the gods', (with\nthese words) he offers in the pan; verily he yokes it again and thereby is it\nnot exhausted. He, who yokes Agni where the yoking is to be performed, yokes\nhim (best) among those who are yoking. 'O Agni [1], yoke thy (steeds)', 'Yoke\nthem that best invoke the gods', he says;' this is the yoking of Agni; verily\nhe yokes him, and yokes him (best) among those who are yoking. The theologians\nsay, 'Should the fire be piled up with face down, or face upwards?' Now the\nfire is piled in the likeness of birds; if he were to pile it face downward,\nthe libations would reach it behind; if upwards, it could not fly, it would\nnot be heavenly for him; he puts down the human head towards the east, face\nupwards [2]; verily the libations reach it in the mouth; he does not pile it\nface upwards; verily it is heavenly for him. He offers with (a verse)\naddressed to Surya; verily he bestows sight upon it; twice he offers, for\nthere are two eyes; he offers with the same verse, for sight is the same, for\nprosperity. The gods and the Asuras were in conflict, they deposited their\ndesirable wealth; the gods appropriated it by means of the Vamabhrt (brick);\nthat is why the Vamabhrt (supporting the desirable) has its name. In that he\nputs down the Vamabhrt, the sacrificer by it appropriates the desirable wealth\nof his foe. It has a head of gold; gold is light, the desirable is light;\nverily by light he appropriates the desirable which is light; there are two\nYajuses, for support.\n\n### v. 5. 4.\n\nThe waters were the wives of Varuna; Agni longed for them, he had union with\nthem; his seed fell away, it became this (earth); what second fell away became\nyonder (sky); this is the Viraj, yonder the Svaraj; in that he puts down two\nViraj (bricks) he puts down these two (worlds). Now the seed which yonder\n(sky) impregnates, finds support in this (earth), it is propagated, it becomes\nplants [1] and shoots; them the fire eats. He who knows thus is propagated,\nand becomes an eater of food. If a man be full of seed, one should put both\ndown in the first layer for him; verily these in accord pour seed for him; if\na man have poured his seed, he should put one in the first layer for him and\none in the last; verily he encloses by the two (worlds) the seed he has\nimpregnated. For a year to no man [2] should he descend in honour; for these\ntwo (worlds) descend in honour for no man; that is their rule. He who piles\nthe fire without a head, becomes headless in yonder world, he who piles it\nwith a head becomes possessed of a head in yonder world. 'To thought I offer\nwith mind, with ghee, that the gods may come hither, delighting in the\nofferings, increasing holy order; on the path of the moving ocean I offer all\nthe days to Vi\xc3\xa7vakarman the undying oblation', (with these words) he puts down\nthe naturally perforated brick and offers [3]; that is the head of the fire;\nverily he piles the fire with its head. He becomes possessed of a head in\nyonder world who know thus. The fire is piled for the world of heaven;\nwhatever is done out of order, that is not heavenly; the fire is heavenly;\nhaving put down the layer he should stroke it, (saying), 'May the wise discern\nwisdom and folly, like backs straight and crooked, like men; for wealth and\ngood offspring, O god, grant us freedom, and keep bondage from us.' Verily he\nputs it down in order. He piles (the fire) facing east; it becomes heavenly\nfor him.\n\n### v. 5. 5.\n\nVi\xc3\xa7vakarman, lord of the quarters, may he protect our cattle, may he protect\nus, to him homage! Prajapati; Rudra; Varuna; Agni; lord of the quarters; may\nhe protect our cattle, may he protect us, to him homage!'  \nThese are the deities, overlords of these animals; to them he is cut off who\nputs down the heads of the animals. He puts down the gold bricks; verily he\npays honour to these deities. The theologians [1] say, 'In the fire he places\nthe domesticated animals, with pain he afflicts the wild animals; what then\ndoes he leave?' In that he puts down the golden bricks, and gold is\nimmortality, by immortality he makes healing for the domesticated animals, he\nhurts them not. The first naturally perforated brick is expiration, the second\ncross -breathing, the third inspiration. Having put down the first naturally\nperforated brick he should breathe out along it; verily he unites expiration\nwith expiration; having put down the second [2] he should breathe across;\nverily he unites cross-breathing with cross-breathing; having put down the\nthird, he should breathe in; verily he unites inspiration with inspiration;\nverily he kindles him with the breaths. 'Bhuh, Bhuvah, Suvar', (with these\nwords) he puts down the naturally perforated bricks; the naturally perforated\nbricks are these worlds; with these exclamations Prajapati was propagated; in\nthat he puts down the naturally perforated bricks with these exclamations, he\nputs down these worlds, and over these [3] worlds he is propagated.  \nFor expiration, for cross-breathing, for inspiration; for speech thee; for\nsight thee; with that deity, in the manner of Angiras, do thou sit firm. By\nAgni the gods sought to go to the world of heaven, with him they could not\nfly; they saw these four naturally perforated bricks, they put them down in\nthe quarters, with him with eyes on all sides they went to the world of\nheaven. In that he puts down four naturally perforated bricks in the quarters,\nthe sacrificer with Agni with eyes on all sides goes to the world of heaven.\n\n### v. 5. 6.\n\na O Agni, come to enjoy', he says; verily he summons him.  \nb 'Agni we choose as envoy', he says; verily having called he chooses him.  \nc 'By Agni Agni is kindled', he says; verily he kindles him.  \nd 'May Agni slay the foes', he says; verily he confers power on him when\nkindled.  \ne 'O Agni, we exalt the praise', he says; verily he exalts him.  \nThese are the forms of the days [1]; verily each day he piles him, and wins\nthe forms of the days. The theologians say, 'For what reason are other bricks\nexhausted, the space-filler not?' 'Because it is connected with Indra and Agni\nand with Brhaspati', he should say, for Indra and Agni and Brhaspati are those\namong the gods who are not exhausted. It has a follower to avoid monotony. He\nfollows it with an Anustubh; the space filler is the body, the Anustubh the\nbreath; therefore breath comes through all the limbs. 'They of him, streaming\nwith milk' [2], he says; therefore there is sap in every joint; 'the dappled\nmix the Soma', he says; the dappled (cow) is food; verily he wins food; Agni\nis praise, food is praise; verily he wins food; 'the clans in the birthplace\nof the gods, in the three realms of sky', he says; verily he makes these\nworlds full of light for him. He who knows the support of the bricks finds\nsupport. 'With that deity, in the manner of Angiras, do thou sit firm,' he\nsays; this is the support of the bricks; he who knows thus finds support.\n\n### v. 5. 7.\n\nThe fire is piled up for the world of heaven; the set of eleven stakes is a\nthunderbolt; if he were to set up eleven stakes in the fire, he would shut it\noff from the world of heaven with the thunderbolt; if he were not to set it\nup, he would sever the animals from the chips; one stake he sets up; verily he\ndoes not shut it off from the world of heaven, nor sever the animals from the\nchips. He who piling the fire steps down on it is deprived of power and\nstrength; he should, with a verse addressed to Indra [1], put down a brick\nopposite his step; verily he is not deprived of power and strength. The fire\nis Rudra, his are three missiles, one that comes straight on, one that strikes\ntransversely, and one that follows up. To them he is cut off who piles the\nfire; having piled the fire he should give (a bow) with three arrows to a\nBrahman, unasked; verily to them he pays homage, and also he ransoms himself\nfrom them.\n\nThe bow of thine, O Rudra, in the east [2], may the wind blow after it for\nthee, to thee, O Rudra, with the year I pay homage.  \nThe bow of thine, O Rudra, on the south, may the wind blow after it for thee,\nto thee, O Rudra, with the full year I pay homage.  \nThe bow of thine, O Rudra, on the west, may the wind blow after it for thee,\nto thee, O Rudra, with the Ida year I pay homage.  \nThe bow of thine, O Rudra, on the north, may the wind blow after it for thee\n[3], to thee, O Rudra, with the Idu year I pay homage.  \nThe bow of thine, O Rudra, above, may the wind blow after it for thee, to\nthee, O Rudra, with the year I pay homage.\n\nAgni is Rudra; just as a tiger stands in anger, so he also (stands); when\npiled with these he reverences him; verily with homage he soothes him.\n\nThe fires [4] of the dust  \nThat have entered within the earth,  \nOf them thou art the highest;  \nDo thou instigate us to life.\n\n'Thee, O Agni, with the mind have I obtained; thee, O Agni, with the fervour\nhave I obtained; thee, O Agni, with the consecration have I obtained; thee, O\nAgni, with the observances have I obtained; thee, O Agni, with the pressing-\nday have I obtained; thee, O Agni, with the sacrificial fees have I obtained;\nthee, O Agni, with the concluding bath have I obtained; thee, O Agni, with the\nbarren cow have I obtained; thee, O Agni, with the cry of Godspeed I have I\nobtained', he says; I this is the obtaining of Agni verily therewith he\nobtains him.\n\n### v. 5. 8.\n\nHe pays reverence in front with the Gayatra (Saman); verily he confers breath\nupon him. (He reverences) the wings with the Brhat and the Rathantara; verily\nhe confers might upon him. (He reverences) the tail with the seasonal\nYaj\xc3\xb1ayaj\xc3\xb1iya; verily he finds support in the seasons. He pays reverence with\nthe Prstha (Stotras); the Prsthas are brilliance; verily he confers brilliance\nupon him. Prajapati created Agni; he, created, went away from him; him he\nchecked ( _avarayata_ ) by the Varavantiya, and that is why the Varavantiya\nhas it name. By the \xc3\x87yaita he congealed him, and that is why the \xc3\x87yaita has\nits name [1]. In that he reverences, with the Varavantiya, he restrains him,\nand by the \xc3\x87yaita he congeals him. At the joinings of the wings he reverences\nwith the heart of Prajapati; verily he attains his affection.\n\nWith the eastern quarter I place thee, with the Gayatri metre, with Agni as\nthe deity; with the head of Agni I put down the head of Agni.  \nWith the southern quarter I place thee, with the Tristubh metre, with Indra as\nthe deity; with the wing of Agni I put down the wing of Agni.  \nWith the western quarter I place thee [2], with the Jagati metre, with Savitr\nas the deity; with the tail of Agni I put down the tail of Agni.  \nWith the northern quarter I place thee, with the Anustubh metre, with Mitra\nand Varuna as the deity; with the wing of Agni I put down the wing of Agni.  \nWith the upright quarter I place thee, with the Pankti metre, with Brhaspati\nas the deity, with the back of Agni I put down the back of Agni.\n\nHe who piles the fire without its body is without a body in yonder world; he\nwho piles it with its body is with his body in yonder world. He puts down the\nbody bricks; this is the body of the fire; verily he piles the fire with its\nbody; he has his body in yonder world who knows thus.\n\n### v. 5. 9.\n\na O Agni, the ocean, thy arrow called the young, with it be gentle  \nto us; homage to this of thine; may we prosper, living on this of thine.  \nb O Agni, the boisterous; c the abysmal; d the strong; e the desirable;  \nthy arrow called young, with it be gentle to us; homage to this of thine;  \nmay we prosper, living on this of thine.\n\nf The layers are the five Agnis, the first is the ocean by name, the second\nthe boisterous [1], the third the abysmal, the fourth the strong, the fifth\nthe desirable; if he were not to offer libations to them they would burn the\nAdhvaryu and the sacrificer; in that he offers these libations, verily he\nsoothes them with their proper portion; neither Adhvaryu nor sacrificer goes\nto ruin.\n\ng May speech be mine in the mouth, breath in the nostrils, sight in the eyes,\nhearing in the ears, might in the arms, force in the thighs, may all my\nmembers be uninjured; may thy body [2] be with my body; homage to thee; harm\nme not.\n\nh The breaths depart from him who piling the fire steps down on it; 'May\nspeech be mine in the mouth, breath in the nostrils', he says; verily he\nbestows the breaths on himself.\n\ni The Rudra in the fire, in the waters, in the plants, the Rudra that hath\nentered all beings, to that Rudra be homage.\n\nk Some Rudras have shares in the libations ( _ahuti_ ), others have shares in\nthe oblations ( _havis_ ) [3]; having offered the \xc3\x87atarudriya, he should put\ndown on the last brick an oblation of Gavidhuka; verily he soothes him with\nhis portion. 'For him indeed is the \xc3\x87atarudriya offered in truth', they say,\n'for whom this (oblation) is made on the fire.'\n\nl May the Vasus, with the Rudras, protect thee on the east; may the Pitrs\nwhose lord is Yama, with the Pitrs, protect thee on the south; may the\nAdityas, with the All-gods, protect thee on the west; may Dyutana Maruta, with\nthe Maruts, protect thee on the north [4]; may the gods, whose chief is Indra,\nprotect thee from below and from above.\n\nm It is not purified, nor made worthy of sacrifice, nor really anointed, if it\nis anointed before this point; in that he anoints it with ghee after it has\nbeen piled, thereby is it purified, made worthy of sacrifice and really\nanointed.\n\n### v. 5. 10.\n\na Thou art the eastern quarter, the favourable by name; of thee as such Agni\nis the overlord, the black (snake) the guardian; the overlord and the\nguardian, to them homage; may they be gentle to us; him whom we hate and who\nhateth us I place within the jaws of you two.  \nThou art the southern quarter, the mighty by name; of thee as such Indra is\nthe overlord, the scorpion, &c.  \nThou art the western quarter, the forward by name; of thee as such [1] Soma is\nthe overlord, the viper, &c.  \nThou art the northern quarter, the stable by name; of thee as such Varuna is\noverlord, the striped snake, &c.  \nThou art the great quarter, the lady paramount by name; of thee as such\nBrhaspati is overlord, the white, &c.  \nThou art this quarter, the powerful by name; of thee as such Yama is the\noverlord, the spotted necked (snake) the guardian; the overlord and the\nguardian, to them homage; may they be gentle to us; him whom we hate and [2]\nwho hateth us I place within the jaws of you two.\n\nb These deities guard the fire when kindled; if he were not to offer libations\nto them, they would suck the Adhvaryu and the sacrificer; in that he offers\nthese libations he soothes them with their proper portion; neither Adhvaryu\nnor sacrificer goes to ruin.\n\nc Ye are missiles by name; your houses are in the east; your arrows are Agni;\nthe water, &c.  \nYe are smearers by name [3]; your houses are in the south, your arrows are the\nfathers; the ocean, &c.  \nYe are the bearers of the bolt by name; your houses are in the west, your\narrows are sleep; the cleft, &c.  \nYe are the stable by name; your houses are in the north; your arrows are the\nwaters; the sea, &c.  \nYe are overlords by name; your houses are above; your arrows are the rain; the\nhelper, &c.  \nYe are the raw-flesh eaters by name, of the earth; your houses are bore [4];\nyour arrows are food; winking is the name of the wind; to you homage; be ye\ngentle to us; him whom we hate and who hateth us I put in your jaws.\n\nd Some gods eat the offerings, others do not; verily the piler of the fire\ndelights both sets. He offers these libations with curds mixed with honey;\nverily he delights them with their proper portion. Or rather they say, 'The\ngods who eat not the oblations are the bricks' [5]. He offers going round in\norder; verily he delights them completely.\n\ne Suck this mighty breast of the waters,  \nFilled in the midst of the flood, O Agni;  \nRejoice in the spring of sweetness, O ocean,  \nEnter thy seat of the sea.\n\nf If one having yoked the fire does not set it free, then just as a horse\nyoked and not set free in hunger is overcome, so his fire is overcome, and\nwith it being overcome the sacrificer is overcome; he having piled the fire\nbecomes aheat [6]; 'Suck this mighty breast of the waters', (with these words)\nhe offers a ladle full of butter; this is the freeing of the fire; verily\nsetting it free he gives it food. Therefore they say, both he who knows and he\nwho knows not.

 \nWith auspicious body, do ye touch my skin;  \nI invoke all you Agnis that sit in the waters;  \nDo ye confer upon me radiance and might and force.  \ne When as ye went below  \nYe cried ( _a nadata_) on the slaying of the serpent,  \nTherefore are yo criers ( _nady ah_) by name;  \nThese are your names, O streams.  \nWhen instigated by Varuna  \nYe wallowed speedily [2],  \nThen Indra obtained ( _apnot_ ) you as ye went  \nTherefore ye are waters ( _a pah_).  \ng As ye glided against his will,  \nHe stayed ( _a vivarata_) your courses,  \nIndra with his might, O goddesses;

(the fire)\nto be piled is Agni's consecration; verily by them is he consecrated; verily\nalso he conquers both the worlds, that of him who has offered the royal\nconsecration and that of the piler of the fire. There are waters; the waters\nare foes of Agni; in that he puts the waters down below the fire, (they serve)\nto overcome his foe; he prospers himself, his foe is defeated. The waters are\nambrosia [1]; therefore they sprinkle with water him who is faint; he does not\ngo to ruin, he lives all his life, for whom these are put down, and who knows\nthem thus. The waters are food, the waters are cattle, cattle are food; an\neater of food and rich in cattle he becomes, for whom these are put down, and\nwho knows them thus. They are twelve; the year has twelve months; verily by\nthe year he wins food for him [2]; there are vessels used; in a vessel is food\neaten; verily he wins food with its birthplace; up to the twelfth generation\nhe eats food; moreover, he is not cut off from his vessel for whom these are\nput down, nor he who knows them thus. The pots and the pans make pairs, for\nthe propagation of pairing; with offspring, with cattle, with pairings is he\npropagated for whom these are put down and he who [3] knows them thus. Agni is\npain; he afflicts the Adhvaryu, the sacrificer, and offspring with pain; in\nthat he puts down water, he soothes his pain; neither Adhvaryu nor sacrificer\ngoes to ruin; offspring are soothed where these are put down. The waters are\nthe hearts of the waters; in that he puts these down, he unites these with\n(the waters) of the sky; Parjanya becomes likely to rain [4]. He who knows\ntheir home and their arrangement becomes possessed of a home, things go in\norder for him. Along the furrows he puts (them) down; this is their home,\ntheir arrangements; he who knows thus becomes possessed of a home, and things\ngo in order for him. The others he puts down in pairs, but four in the middle,\nfor support. The bricks are food, this oblation is food in very presence; in\nthat he puts down this oblation, verily straightway [5] he wins food for him;\nin the middle he puts (them) down; verily he bestows food on him in the\nmiddle; therefore in the middle is food eaten. It is offered to Brhaspati;\nBrhaspati is the holy power of the gods: verily by holy power he wins food for\nhim. 'Thou art splendour; for splendour thee!' he says; brilliant and\nresplendent does he become, for whom these are put down, and he who knows it\nthus.\n\n### v. 6. 3.\n\nHe puts down the bricks of being; in every place is death born; wherever death\nis born, thence he removes it by sacrifice; therefore the piler of the fire\nlives all his life, for all deaths are removed by him; therefore the piler of\nthe fire is not to be practised against; his witchcraft turns upon him (who\ndoes so) and lays him low. He who piles the fire is consecrated; these are the\nofferings of the divine consecrators; so many are the consecrations of the\ngods, and they [1] confer consecrations upon him; they consecrate him, the\nfire is consecration; the royal consecration is the consecration of Varuna;\n(the fire) to be piled is the consecration of holy power. 'On the instigation\nof the god Savitr, thee', he says; verily instigated by Savitr he consecrates\nhim with holy power, with the deities. He pours down every sort of food, to\nwin every sort of food. He pours down over him from the front face to face;\nfor from the front face to face is food eaten. He pours down from the head,\nfor from the head is food eaten; he causes (the water) to flow over up to the\nmouth [2]; verily on the mouth he bestows food-eating upon him. 'With the\nlordship of Agni I consecrate thee', he says; this is the consecration of\nAgni; verily he consecrates him with it. 'With the lordship of Brhaspati I\nconsecrate thee', he says; Brhaspati is the holy power of the gods; verily\nwith holy power he consecrates him. 'With the lordship of Indra I consecrate\nthee', he says; verily he confers power from above upon him. That [3] is the\nform of the royal consecration. He who knowing thus piles the fire conquers\nboth the worlds, that of him who has offered the royal consecration and that\nof the piler of the fire. When Indra had been consecrated, his power and\nstrength fell away in ten places; the gods brought it together with the\nSautramani; he who piles the fire is consecrated; having piled the fire he\nshould sacrifice with the Sautramani; verily collecting power and strength he\nplaces them in himself.\n\n### v. 6. 4.\n\nThe year in unison with the Ayavans the dawn in unison with the  \nruddy (cows); Surya in unison with the steed; the A\xc3\xa7vins in unison  \nwith the wondrous works. Agni Vai\xc3\xa7vanara in unison with the food  \nofferings; with ghee; hail!\n\nThe year is the year, the Ayavas are the months, the red one the dawn, the\nsteed Surya, the A\xc3\xa7vins these two (worlds), Agni Vai\xc3\xa7vanara the year, the food\nofferings cattle, ghee cattle. With the year cattle are born; verily with the\nyear he produces cattle for him. He offers on a blade of Darbha grass [1]; the\nDarbhas are the ambrosia, the strength of the (earth); he offers on it; verily\nhe is propagated. An eater of food he becomes for whom they offer thus. These\ndeities are the foremost portions of Agni; verily he delights them; verily too\nhe places the eye of Agni in front; he becomes not blind who knows thus.\nWaters were the world at first, the Moving ocean; Prajapati, becoming wind,\nrocked about on a lotus leaf; he [2] could find no support; he saw that nest\nof the waters, on it he piled the fire, that became this (earth), then indeed\ndid he find support. (The brick) which he put down in front became the head,\nthat is the eastern quarter; (the brick) which he put down on the right became\nthe right side, that is the southern quarter; (the brick) which he put down\nbehind became the tail, that is the western quarter; (the brick) which he put\ndown on the left [3] became the left side, that is the northern quarter; (the\nbrick) which he put down above became the back, that is the zenith. Agni of\nthe five bricks is this (earth); therefore when they dig in it they knock up\nagainst the brick, against gravel. Now all this (earth) in the eyes of the\nbirds shines at night, therefore birds do not at night rest upon it. He who\nknowing this piles a fire finds support, and conquers all the quarters. The\nBrahman is connected with Agni, therefore the Brahman finds prosperity in all\nthe quarters; verily every quarter he goes to is his own. The fire is the nest\nof the waters; therefore waters draw the fire; verily they enter their own\nbirthplace.\n\n### v. 6. 5.\n\nHaving kept the fire in the pan for a year in the second year he should offer\non eight potsherds to Agni, to Indra on eleven potsherds, to the All-gods on\ntwelve potsherds, to Brhaspati an oblation, to Visnu on three potsherds; in\nthe third year he should sacrifice with the Abhijit (offering). In that there\nis (an offering) on eight potsherds, the Gayatri has eight syllables, and the\nmorning pressing is connected with Agni and the Gayatri, verily he supports by\nit the morning pressing and the Gayatri metre. In that there is (an offering)\non eleven potsherds, the Tristubh has eleven syllables, and the midday\npressing is connected with Indra and the Tristubh, verily he supports by it\nthe midday pressing and the Tristubh [1] metre. In that there is (an offering)\non twelve potsherds, the Jagati has twelve syllables, and the third pressing\nis connected with the All-gods and the Jagati, verily he supports by it the\nthird pressing and the Jagati metre. In that there is an oblation to\nBrhaspati, and Brhaspati is the holy power of the gods, verily he supports by\nit holy power. In that there is (an offering) to Visnu on three potsherds, and\nVisnu is the sacrifice, verily he supports by it the sacrifice. In that he\nsacrifices with the Abhijit in the third year, (it serves) for conquest. In\nthat he keeps the fire in the pan for a year, he [2] saves this world by it;\nin that he piles the fire in the second year, he saves the atmosphere by it;\nin that he sacrifices in the third year, he saves yonder world by it. This\n(fire) Para Atnara, Kaksivant Au\xc3\xa7ija, Vitahavya \xc3\x87rayasa, and Trasadasyu\nPaurukutsya piled, being desirous of offspring; then indeed did they win\nthousands each of children; he is extended with offspring, with cattle, that\nmeasure he attains which they attained, who knowing thus piles the fire.\n\n### v. 6. 6.\n\na Prajapati piled the fire; it kept being razor-edged; the gods in terror did\nnot approach it; they, clothing themselves in the metres, approached it, and\nthat is why the metres have their name. The metres are holy power; the black\nantelope skin is the form of holy power; he puts on a pair of black antelope\nskin shoes; verily clothing himself with the metres he approaches the fire, to\nprevent injury to himself.  \nb The fire is put down as a treasure of the gods [1]. Now a treasure unguarded\nothers find, or he cannot recollect where it is; he steps on the fire-pan;\nverily he makes himself its overlord, for guardianship. Or rather they say,\n'It should not be stepped on'; the pan is connected with Nirrti; if he were to\nstep on it, he would hand himself over to Nirrti; therefore it should not be\nstepped on. He puts down the human head, for guardianship; and moreover this\nis just as if one should say, 'Guard that for me' [2].  \nc Atharvan is Prajapati; Dadhya\xc3\xb1c Atharvana is the fire, his bones are the\nbricks; as to that the seer says, 'Indra with the bones of Dadhya\xc3\xb1c'. In that\nhe piles the fire with the bricks, he piles up the fire with itself; he has\nhis own self in yonder world who knows thus.  \nd (The fire) to be piled is the body of Agni, Vai\xc3\xa7vanara is the self; in that\nhe offers to Vai\xc3\xa7vanara after the piling, he prepares its [3] body and mounts\nit; the sacrificer thus prepares his body, in that he piles the fire; in that\nhe offers to Vai\xc3\xa7vanara after the piling, verily having pre pared his body he\nmounts it with the self; therefore they do not cut off from it; verily living\nhe goes to the gods.  \ne He puts on dust with a verse addressed to Vai\xc3\xa7vanara; Agni Vai\xc3\xa7vanara is\nthis (earth), the dust is its piling; verily he piles Agni Vai\xc3\xa7vanara;\nVai\xc3\xa7vanara is the form dear to Agni; verily he wins the form dear to him.\n\n### v. 6. 7.\n\nThe gods obtained the brilliance ( _vir ajam_) of Agni by means of the\nconsecration; for three nights should he be consecrated; the Viraj has three\nfeet, he obtains the Viraj. For six nights should he b consecrated; the year\nconsists of six seasons; the Viraj is the year, he obtains the Viraj. For ten\nnights should he be consecrated; the Viraj has ten syllables; he obtains the\nViraj. For twelve nights should he be consecrated; the year has twelve months;\nthe Viraj is the year; he obtains the Viraj. He should be consecrated for\nthirteen nights; the year has thirteen months [1]; the Viraj is the year; he\nobtains the Viraj. For fifteen nights should he be consecrated; the nights of\nthe half-month are fifteen; the year is made up by the half-months; the Viraj\nis the year; he obtains the Viraj. For seventeen nights should he be\nconsecrated; the year has twelve months and seven seasons; the Viraj is the\nyear; he obtains the Viraj. For twenty-four nights should he be consecrated;\nthe year has twenty-four half-months; the Viraj is the year; he obtains the\nViraj. For thirty nights should he be consecrated [2]; the Viraj has thirty\nsyllables; he obtains the Viraj. For a month should he be consecrated; the\nyear is the month; the Viraj is the year; he obtains the Viraj. For four\nmonths should he be consecrated; for four months the Vasus bore him, they\nconquered the earth, the Gayatri metre; for eight the Rudras, they conquered\nthe atmosphere, the Tristubh metre; for twelve the Adityas, they conquered the\nsky, the Jagati metre; then they attained distinction, supremacy over the\ngods. Therefore after keeping the fire for twelve months, should one pile it\nup; the year has twelve months, the fire to be piled is the year, the bricks\nare days and nights; he piles him with the bricks obtained; verily also he\nattains distinction, supremacy over his equals.\n\n### v. 6. 8.\n\na Agni is piled for the world of heaven; if he were not to mount after him the\nsacrificer would be excluded from the world of heaven. 'I have mounted on the\nearth; let not breath forsake me'; 'I have mounted on the atmosphere; let not\noffspring forsake me'; 'I have mounted on the sky, we have attained the\nlight', he says; this is the mounting after Agni verily by it he mounts after\nhim, to attain the world of heaven.  \nb If he were to set up (the eleven posts) commensurate with the wings [1], he\nwould make the sacrificial rite too small, his offspring would be worse off\nthan himself. He sets (it) up commensurate with the altar; verily he makes the\nsacrificial rite larger, his offspring does not become worse than himself.  \ne He should pile (the fire) of a thousand (bricks) when first piling (it);\nthis world is commensurate with a thousand; verily he conquers this world. He\nshould pile (it) of two thousand when piling a second time; the atmosphere is\ncommensurate with two thousand; verily be conquers the atmosphere. He should\npile (it) of three thousand when piling for the third time [2]; yonder world\nis commensurate with three thousand; verily he conquers yonder world.  \nd Knee deep should he pile (it), when piling for the first time; verily with\nthe Gayatri he mounts this world; navel deep should he pile (it) when piling\nfor the second time; verily with the Tristubh he mounts the atmosphere; neck\ndeep should he pile (it) when piling for the third time; verily with the\nJagati he mounts yonder world.  \ne After piling the fire he should not have intercourse with a woman of\npleasure, thinking, 'I shall deposit seed in that which is no womb'; nor after\npiling for the second time should he have intercourse with the wife of another\n[3], nor after piling for a third time should he have intercourse with any\nwoman whatever. In that he piles the fire, he deposits seed; if he were to\nhave intercourse. he would be deprived of seed. Or rather they say, 'If he\nwere not to have intercourse, there would be no offspring.' In that he puts\ndown the two Retahsic (bricks), they support the seed of the sacrificer;\ntherefore he should have intercourse, for the non-spilling of seed.'  \nf Three seeds are there, father, son, grandson [4]; if he were to put down two\nRetahsic (bricks), he would cleave his seed; three he puts down, for the\ncontinuity of seed; the first Retahsic is this (earth), this (earth) is\nspeech, therefore they see this (earth), they see speech speaking; the second\nis the atmosphere, the atmosphere is breath, therefore they see not the\natmosphere, nor breath; the third is yonder (sky), yonder (sky) is the eye,\ntherefore they see yonder (sky), they see the eye. With a Yajus he sets down\nthis one [5] and yonder one, but with mind only the middle, to arrange these\nworlds, and also the breaths.  \ng 'The sacrifice offered by the Bhrgus, the Vasus, accord our desires; of thee\nthus offered, enjoyed, may I here enjoy wealth,' he says; verily he milks\nthereby the song and the recitation.  \nh 'Father Matari\xc3\xa7van, bestow flawless abodes; the flawless abodes the U\xc3\xa7ijs\nhave made; let Soma, all knowing, the leader, be leader; let Brhaspati recite\nhymns and rejoicing,' he says; that is Agni's hymn, and with it he recites\nafter him.\n\n### v. 6. 9.\n\na That fire which is kept in the pan is consecrated of fires; if he were to\nput it down their embryos would be liable to abortion, and that would be like\ndescending after consecration. He sets it on a throne, to support and prevent\nthe falling of embryos, and he makes thus a consecration.  \nb (The fire) in the pan is an embryo, the sling is the womb; if he were to\nremove the pan from the sling, he would strike the embryo from the womb; the\nsling has six ropes; man is sixfold [1], the body, the head, four limbs;\nverily in himself he bears it.  \nc The fire is Prajapati, his breasts are the pan and the mortar; his offspring\nlive on them; in that he puts down the pan and the mortar, with them the\nsacrificer milks the fire in yonder world.  \nd The fire is the year, its bricks are arranged threefold, those of Prajapati,\nof Visnu [2], of Vi\xc3\xa7vakarman; the Prajapati (bricks) are the days and nights;\nin that he keeps (the fire) in the pan, he puts down the Prajapati (bricks);\nin that he takes up the kindling-sticks, and the trees are Visnu's, verily he\nputs down the Visnu (bricks); in that he piles the fire with bricks, and\nVi\xc3\xa7vakarman is this (earth), verily he puts down the Vi\xc3\xa7vakarman (bricks).\nTherefore they say, 'Threefold is Agni.'  \ne This thus should the sacrificer himself pile; if another pile his fire, if\nhe should not prosper him with sacrificial gifts, he would appropriate his\nfire; him who piles his fire he should prosper with sacrificial gifts; verily\nthus he preserves his fire.\n\n### v. 6. 10.\n\nPrajapati piled the fire as the year by the seasons; by the spring he piled\nits front half, by the summer its right wing, by the rains its tail, by the\nautumn its left wing, by the winter its middle. By the Brahman class he piled\nits front half, by the lordly class its right wing, by cattle its tail, by the\npeople its left wing, by hope its middle. He who knowing thus piles the fire\npiles it with the seasons; verily he wins all [1]; they hearken to him who has\npiled the fire, he eats food, he is resplendent. The first layer is this\n(earth), the mortar the plants and trees; the second is the atmosphere, the\nmortar the birds; the third is yonder (sky), the mortar the Naksatras; the\nfourth the sacrifice, the mortar the sacrificial fee; the fifth the\nsacrificer, the mortar offspring; if he were to pile it with three layers, he\nwould obstruct the sacrifice, the fee, the self, offspring; therefore should\nit be piled with five layers; verily he preserves all. In that there [2] are\nthree layers, (it is) since Agni is threefold; in that there are two (more),\nthe sacrificer has two feet, (it is) for support; there are five layers, man\nis five fold; verily he preserves himself. There are five layers, he covers\n(them) with five (sets of) mortar, these make up ten, man has ten elements; he\npreserves man in his full extent. Again the Viraj has ten elements, the Viraj\nis food; verily he finds support in the Viraj and the eating of food.

With a Gayatri (verse)\naddressed to Agni should he stroke the first layer; with a Tristubh the\nsecond; with a Jagati the third; with an Anustubh the fourth; with a Pankti\nthe fifth; verily he piles the fire according to the deity. He falls not a\nvictim to the deities; he becomes richer. This is the dividing of the\nsacrificial food; the food is cattle, and he piles it with cattle [1].  \nb He who piles the fire after announcing to Prajapati does not go to ruin. The\nhorses should stand on either side, on the left the black, on the right the\nwhite; having offered them he should put down the bricks; that is the form of\nPrajapati, the horse is connected with Prajapati; verily having announced to\nPrajapati in real presence he piles the fire, he does not go to ruin; the\nwhite horse is the form of day, the black of night; the bricks are the form of\nday [2], the mortar of night; when about to put down the bricks he should\nstroke the white horse, when about to put down the mortar he should stroke the\nblack; verily with the days and nights he piles it.  \nc A golden vessel full of honey he gives, (saying), 'May I be possessed of\nhoney'; with (a verse) addressed to Surya, containing the word 'brilliant', he\nshould gaze (on it); verily it becomes brilliant in the midday; he causes the\nhorse to sniff it; Indra is yonder sun, Prajapati is he; the horse is\nconnected with Prajapati; verily he wins him straightway.\n\n### v. 7. 2.\n\na To thee, O Agni, the bull, the wise,  \nI have come, generating thee ever new;  \nBe our household rites not halting;  \nWith thy keen holy power sharpen us.\n\nThe bricks are cattle, in each layer he puts down a bull (brick); verily in\nhis sacrifice he makes a pairing for propagation; therefore in every herd\nthere is a bull.\n\nb The image of the year  \nWhich men revere in thee, O night,  \nMaking his offspring rich in heroes,  \nMay he obtain all life.\n\nHe puts down this Prajapati (brick) [1]; the sole eighth day is this (earth);\nin that food is made on the sole eighth day, he wins it thereby; this is the\nwish cow of Prajapati; verily by it the sacrificer in yonder world milks the\nfire.\n\nc With the light wherewith the gods went upward,  \nWherewith the Adityas, the Vasus, the Rudras,  \nWherewith the Angirases attained greatness,  \nWith that let the sacrificer go in prosperity.\n\nThe fire is piled for the world of heaven [2]; (with the words) With the light\nwherewith the gods went upwards', he lights the fire in the pan; verily he\nputs down the bricks connected with the trees, to win the world of heaven.\n\nd (Homage) to the hundred-weaponed, him of a hundred powers,  \nHim of a hundred aids, the overcomer of hostility,  \nTo Indra who shall lead us over all obstacles  \nThrough autumns without fail.  \ne The four paths going to the gods  \nWhich stretch between sky and earth,  \nTo him, O gods, do ye all accord us  \nWho brought to them unfailing power and untirelessness [3].  \nf Summer, winter, and spring for us,  \nAutumn, the rains be favourable for us;  \nMay we enjoy the favour and protection  \nOf these seasons through a hundred autumns.  \ng To the Idu year, the complete year, the year  \nPay ye honour great;  \nIn their lovingkindness that are worthy of sacrifice  \nMay we long be unfailing, unsmitten.  \nh Better than good have the gods brought together;  \nWith thee as aid may we win thee;  \nDo thou, wonder-working, O drop [4], enter us,  \nBe propitious and kindly to our children, our descendants.\n\ni He puts down these unfailing (bricks), they are the gods unconquered; verily\nhe enters them; he is not conquered.  \nk The theologians say, 'Since the months, the half-months, the seasons, the\nyears cook the plants, then why is the offering of first-fruits made to other\ndeities?' The gods conquered these (plants); if he were to offer to the\nseasons, he would cause strife with the gods; having offered the offering of\nfirst-fruits, he offers these libations; verily he delights the half-months,\nthe months, the seasons, the year; he does not cause strife with the gods.\n'Better than good have the gods brought together', he says, for the eating of\nthe offering, to prevent the defeat of the sacrificer.\n\n### v. 7. 3.\n\na Thou art the thunderbolt of Indra, slaying foes;  \nGuarding our bodies, lying in wait;  \nHe who in east, south, west,  \nIn the north, as a foe plots against us,  \nMay he strike on this rock.\n\nThe gods and the Asuras were in conflict; the Asuras sought to force them from\nthe quarters; the gods repelled them with arrow and thunder bolt; in that he\nputs down the thunderbolt (bricks), he repels his foes with arrow and\nthunderbolt; in the quarters [1] he puts down; verily he puts round him those\ncitadels of the gods, which guard the body.\n\nb O Agni and Visnu,  \nMay these songs gladden you in unison;  \nCome ye with radiance and strength.\n\nThe theologians say, 'Since they do not offer to any deity, then what deity\nhas the stream of wealth?' Wealth is Agni, this stream is his; wealth is\nVisnu, this stream is his; with a verse addressed to Agni and Visnu he offers\nthe stream of wealth; verily he unites them with their proper portions; verily\nalso [2] he makes this libation to have an abode; he wins that for desire of\nwhich he makes this offering. The fire is Rudra; now two are his bodies, the\ndread the one, the auspicious the other; in that he offers the \xc3\x87atarudriya, he\nsoothes with it his dread form; in that he offers the stream of wealth, he\ndelights with it his auspicious form. He, who knows the support of the stream\nof wealth [3], finds support. If there is any butter left over, in it he\nshould cook a mess for the Brahmans, four Brahmans should eat it; the Brahman\nis Agni Vai\xc3\xa7vanara, Vai\xc3\xa7vanara, is the form dear to Agni; verily he\nestablishes it in his dear form. He should give four cows; verily with them\nthe sacrificer in yonder world milks the fire.\n\n### v. 7. 4.\n\na 'To thought I offer with mind, with ghee', he says; the oblation to\nVi\xc3\xa7vakarman is called the undeceivable; the foe cannot deceive him who has\npiled; verily also he wins the gods.  \nb 'O Agni, to-day', (with these words) he offers with a Pankti verse, and by\nthe Pankti and the libation he grasps the beginning of the sacrifice.  \nC 'Seven are thy kindling-sticks, O Agni; seven thy tongues', he says; verily\nhe wins the Hotr's offices. Agni went away from the gods, desiring a portion\n[1]; to him they assigned this as a portion; that is the Agnihotra, of Agni;\nthen is he born indeed when he is completely piled. Verily to him on birth he\ngives food; he delighted delights him, he becomes richer.  \nd The theologians say, 'Since it is as the Garhapatya that (the fire) is\npiled, then where is its Ahavaniya?' 'Yonder sun', he should reply, for in it\nthey offer to all the gods [2]. He who knowing thus piles the fire straightway\nmakes pleased the gods.\n\ne O Agni, the glorious, lead him to glory;  \nBring hither the fame that is Indra's;  \nMay he be head, overlord, resplendent,  \nMost famed of his equals.  \nWith look auspicious first they underwent  \nFervour and consecration, the seers who found the heavenly light;  \nThence was born the kingly power, might and force;  \nMay the gods in unison accord that to us.  \nDisposer, ordainer, and highest [3] onlooker,  \nPrajapati, supreme lord, the ruler;  \nThe Stomas, the metres, the Nivids, mine they call;  \nTo him may we secure the kingdom.  \nTurn towards me, come to me;  \nMay he be your ruler, your overlord;  \nOn his discernment do ye depend;  \nUpon him henceforth do ye all serve.\n\nHe puts down these supporters of the realm; this is the realm supporting\npiling of the fire; verily with it he bestows on him the kingly power, he\nbecomes the kingly power, the kingly power does not fall away from him.\n\n### v. 7. 5.\n\na Just as a son born dies, so dies he whose fire in the pan is extinguished.\nIf he were to make it by friction, he would divide (the fire), he would\nproduce a foe for him. It must again be kindled (with wood) around; verily he\nproduces it from its own birthplace, he does not produce a foe for him.\nDarkness seizes on him whose fire in the pan is extinguished, darkness is\ndeath; a black garment, a black heifer are the sacrificial fees; verily with\ndarkness [1] he smites away the darkness which is death. Gold he gives, gold\nis light; verily with the light he smites away the darkness; moreover gold is\nbrilliance; verily he confers brilliance upon himself.\n\nb Like heavenly light, the heat; hail! Like heavenly light, the Arka hail!\nLike heavenly light, the bright; hail! Like heavenly light, the light; hail!\nLike heavenly light, the sun; hail!'\n\nThe fire is Arka, the horse sacrifice is yonder sun [2]; in that he offers\nthese libations he unites the lights of the Arka and the horse sacrifice; he\nindeed is an offerer of the Arka and the horse sacrifice, for whom this is\ndone in the fire.  \nc The waters were first this world, the moving; Prajapati saw this first\nlayer, it he put down, it became this (earth). To him Vi\xc3\xa7vakarman said, 'Let\nme come to thee'; 'There is no space here', he answered [3]. He saw this\nsecond layer, he put it down, it became the atmosphere. The sacrifice said to\nPrajapati, 'Let me come to thee'; 'There is no space here', he answered. He\nsaid to Vi\xc3\xa7vakarman, 'Let me come to thee.' 'In what way wilt thou come to me?\n' 'By the regional (bricks)', he replied. He came with the regional (bricks),\nhe put them down, they became the regions [4]. The supreme lord said to\nPrajapati, 'Let me come to thee'; 'There is no space here', he answered. He\nsaid to Vi\xc3\xa7vakarman and the sacrifice, 'Let me come to you two'; 'There is no\nspace here', they answered. He saw this third layer, he put it down, it became\nyonder (world). Aditya said to Prajapati, 'Let me come to thee' [5]; 'There is\nno space here', he answered. He said to Vi\xc3\xa7vakarman and the sacrifice, 'Let me\ncome to you two'; 'There is no space here', they answered. He said to the\nsupreme lord, 'Let me come to thee.' 'In what way wilt thou come to me?' 'By\nthe space-filler', he replied. He came to him by the space filler; therefore\nthe space-filler is unexhausted, for yonder Aditya is unexhausted [6]. To them\nthe seers said, 'Let us come to you.' 'In what way will ye come?' 'By\ngreatness', they replied. To them they came with two (more) layers; (the fire)\nbecame one of five layers. He who knowing thus piles the fire becomes greater,\nhe conquers these worlds, the gods know him; moreover he attains community\nwith these deities.\n\n### v. 7. 6.\n\na The fire is a bird; if the piler of the fire were to eat of a bird, he would\nbe eating the fire, he would go to ruin. For a year should he observe the vow,\nfor a vow goes not beyond a year.  \nb The fire is an animal; now an animal destroys him who moves up to it face to\nface; therefore he should go up to it from behind while it is looking towards\nthe front, to prevent injury to himself.  \nc 'Brilliance art thou, grant me brilliance, restrain earth [1], guard me from\nthe earth. Light art thou, grant me light, restrain the atmosphere, guard me\nfrom the atmosphere. Heavenly light art thou, grant me heavenly light,\nrestrain the heavenly light, guard me from the sky', he says; by these are\nthese worlds supported; in that he puts them down, (it is) for the support of\nthese worlds. Having put down the naturally perforated (bricks) he puts down\nthe gold bricks; the naturally perforated are these worlds, gold is light; in\nthat having put down the naturally perforated [2] he puts down the gold\nbricks; verily he makes these worlds full of light by means of them; verily\nalso by them these worlds shine forth for him.\n\nd Those flames of thine, O Agni, which rising in the sun,  \nWith rays envelop the sky,  \nWith all of them bring us to brilliance, to man.  \nThose flames of yours in the sun, O gods,  \nThose flames in cattle, in horses,  \nO Indra and Agni, with all of these  \nGrant us brilliance, O Brhaspati.  \nGrant us brilliance [3] in our Brahmans,  \nPlace brilliance in our princes,  \nBrilliance in Vi\xc3\xa7yas and \xc3\x87udras;  \nWith thy flame grant me brilliance.\n\nThe glory and power of him who has piled the fire go apart twofold, or to the\nfire which he has piled or to the man who has sacrificed. In that he offers\nthese libations, he places in himself power and fame.  \ne He who having piled the fire steps on it is liable to go to ruin. 'To thee I\ncome praising with holy power'; with this verse addressed to Varuna [4] should\nhe offer; that is the soothing of the fire and the protection of himself.  \nf He who piles the fire is made into an offering; just as an offering spills,\nso he spills who having piled the fire approaches a woman; with clotted curds\nfor Mitra and Varuna he should sacrifice; verily he approaches unity with\nMitra and Varuna, to avoid his spilling.  \ng He who knows the fire to rest on the seasons, for him the seasons go in\norder; he finds support. The fire resting on the seasons is the year [5]; the\nhead is the spring, the right side summer, the tail the rains, the left side\nautumn, the middle winter, the layers the first half-months, the mortar the\nsecond half-months, the bricks the days and nights; this is the fire resting\non the seasons; he who knows thus, for him the seasons go in order; he finds\nsupport.  \nh Prajapati, desirous of supremacy, put down the fire; then did he attain\nsupremacy; he who knowing thus piles the fire attains thus supremacy.\n\n### v. 7. 7.\n\na What has flowed from purpose, or heart,  \nOr what is gathered from mind or sight,  \nFollow to the world of good deed,  \nWhere are the seers, the first-born, the ancient ones.  \nb This I place around thee, O abode, the treasure  \nWhom the all-knower hath brought here;  \nAfter you the lord of the sacrifice will follow;  \nKnow ye him in the highest firmament.  \nc Know ye him in the highest firmament,  \nO gods associates, ye know his form;  \nWhen he shall come [1] by the paths, god-travelled,  \nDo ye reveal to him what is sacrificed and bestowed.  \nd Move ye forward; go ye along together,  \nMake ye the paths, god-travelled, O Agni  \nIn this highest abode,  \nO All-gods, sit ye with the sacrificer.  \ne With the strew, the encircling- stick,  \nThe offering-ladle, the altar, the grass ( _barhis_ ),  \nWith the Rc, bear this sacrifice for us  \nTo go to the heaven to the gods.  \nf What is offered, what is handed over,  \nWhat is given, the sacrificial fee,  \nThat [2] may Agni Vai\xc3\xa7vanara  \nPlace in the sky among the gods for us.  \ng That by which thou bearest a thousand,  \nThou, O Agni, all wealth,  \nBy that (path) do thou bear the sacrifice of ours,  \nTo go to the gods in heaven.  \nh By that (path) by which, O Agni, the priests, busy,  \nBear the fees, the sacrifice,  \nBy that do thou bear this sacrifice of ours,  \nTo go to the gods in heaven.  \ni By that (path) by which, O Agni, the doers of good deeds,  \nObtain the streams of honey,  \nBy that do thou bear this sacrifice of ours,  \nTo go to the gods in heaven.  \nk Where are the streams that fail not  \nOf honey and of ghee,  \nMay Agni Vai\xc3\xa7vanara place us  \nIn heaven among the gods.\n\n### v. 7. 8.\n\na Thy kindling-sticks, O Agni, thine abodes,  \nThy tongues, O all-knower, thy light,  \nThy cracklings, thy drops,  \nWith these pile thyself, well knowing.\n\nThe fire is an extended sacrifice; what of it is performed, what not? What the\nAdhvaryu in piling the fire omits, that of himself he omits. 'Thy kindling-\nsticks, O Agni, thine [1] abodes', he says; this is the self piling of the\nfire; verily the fire piles the fire, the Adhvaryu omits nothing from himself.\n\nb To the four quarters let the fires advance;  \nMay he bear this sacrifice for us, well knowing;  \nMaking rich the ghee, immortal, full of heroes,  \nThe holy power is the kindling-stick of the libations.\n\nThe tortoise is put down for the world of heaven; 'To the four quarters let\nthe fires advance', he says [2]; verily by it he recognizes the quarters; 'May\nhe bear this sacrifice for us, well knowing', he says, for guidance to the\nworld of heaven; 'The holy power is the kindling-stick of the libations', he\nsays. By means of the holy power the gods went to the world of heaven; in that\nhe puts down (the tortoise) with (a verse) containing the word 'holy power',\nby the holy power the sacrificer goes to the world of heaven.  \nc The fire is Prajapati here; cattle are the offspring; the form the metres;\nall colours of bricks should he make; verily by the form he wins offspring,\ncattle, the metres; verily also he piles it winning it for offspring, cattle,\nthe metres.\n\n### v. 7. 9.\n\na In me I take first Agni,  \nFor increase of wealth, for good offspring with noble heroes;  \nIn me offspring, in me radiance I place;  \nMay we be unharmed in our body with good heroes.  \nb The immortal Agni who hath entered  \nInto us mortals within the heart, O fathers,  \nMay we enclose him in ourselves;  \nMay he not abandon us and go afar.\n\nIf the Adhvaryu without taking the fire in himself were to pile it, he would\npile his own fire also [1] for the sacrificer. Now cattle depend upon the\nfire; cattle would be likely to depart from him. 'In me I take first Agni', he\nsays; verily in himself he supports his own fire, cattle depart not from him.  \nb The theologians say, 'Since clay and water are not food for Agni, then why\nis he piled with clay and water?' In that he joins with water [2] and all the\ndeities are the waters, verily he unites him with the waters. In that he piles\nwith clay and Agni Vai\xc3\xa7vanara is this earth, verily he piles Agni with Agni.  \nc The theologians say, 'Since the fire is piled with clay and water, then why\nis it called the fire?' In that he piles with the metres and the metres are\nfires, therefore is it called fire. Moreover Agni Vai\xc3\xa7vanara is this (earth);\nin that [3] he piles with clay, therefore is it called the fire.  \nd He puts down golden bricks; gold is light; verily be confers light upon him;\nagain gold is brilliance; verily he confers radiance upon himself. He, who\npiles (the fire) with faces on all sides, eats food in all his offspring,\nconquers all the quarters. In the east he puts down a Gayatri, a Tristubh on\nthe south, a Jagati on the west, an Anustubh on the north, a Pankti in the\nmiddle; this is the fire with faces on all sides: he, who knowing thus piles\nit, eats food in all his offspring, conquers all the quarters; verily also he\nweaves quarter in quarter; therefore quarter is woven in quarter.\n\n### v. 7. 10.\n\nPrajapati created the fire; it created ran away east from him; he cast the\nhorse at it, it turned to the south; he cast the ram at it, it turned to the\nwest; he cast the bull at it, it turned to the north; he cast the goat at it,\nit ran upwards. He cast the man at it. In that he puts down the heads of\nanimals, he piles it [1], winning it on every side. The heads of animals are\nbricks, breath supporting, full of sight; in that he puts down the heads of\nanimals, the sacrificer breathes with them in yonder world; verily also these\nworlds shine forth for him by them. He puts them down after smearing with mud,\nfor purity.
