But there is a deity superior to this\ngod. That god slew Vishnu and he destroyed the [appearance](errata.htm#36) of\nSiva ( _abhava_ ) Surely this is the great God indeed if thou consider it\nwell.\n\n201\n\nThey call a pot, olla; they name a hill, collis; salt they call sal; are they\nnot however one? The languages alone are diverse, the essence is one.\n\n202\n\nVishnu, Siva, and Brahma all see the leaf but view it who will, none can\nperceive the branch. Were the branch behold, [would](errata.htm#37) any\nabstain from lauding it?\n\n203\n\nHe, he, and he exist in him; neither he, he, nor he is He. He that unites them\nwith him--go to--he is the Divinity.\n\n204\n\nIf thou know the beauty of the five letters, in these five cloth beatitude\nconsist. He (the divinity) is the one who dwells in that five.\n\np. 58\n\n205\n\nSlay Brahma, and mingle him with Vishnu. Slay Vishnu and resolve him into\nSiva. Slay Siva and become thyself the Siva yogee (or chief spirit).\n\n206\n\nTo them who understand the meaning of the excellent _sankhya yoga_ I will in\nthis world declare the truth through the most noble _raja-yoga_. Listen to the\ngreatness of Siva (pure sanskrit).\n\n207\n\nWhy all this grief. If with singleness of heart thou extinguish thy desires by\nimmersing thy soul in (Hari, Hara and Aaja, Vishnu, Siva and Brahma) the three\ngods and maintain a subdued spirit, happiness shall be formed within thee.\n\n208\n\nThe body of this visible world is a vessel of God, the life therein is air.\nThe sun, moon and fire are his eyes (number, body assemblage of eyes). There\nis no God but this.\n\np. 59\n\n209\n\nHe who slays his great (five) foes, and vanquishes cupid, and has learnt the\nfive lettered name ( _Namassivaya_ ), he attains the porch of him, the five\nfaced who is entitled _Bhava_ (emphatically existence i.e., Siva).\n\n210\n\nOf what use is that Saiva faith that knows not the path through this universe\ncompounded of inanimate and animate bodies and lingams, They shall not know\nthe becoming (or the act of transformation into) Hara the eight bodied.\n\n211\n\nHe who divideth the lord Iswara into seven parts and has dedicated by the\nceremony of pouring his whole body to God by any unfailing practice of such\nconduct shall become the chief of yogees.\n\n212\n\nHe who hath attained the bliss that dwells in the five lettered name, shall\nshine both here and hereafter in bliss. To know this life and next, this is\ndeity.\n\np. 60\n\n213\n\nMighty let us to cut pieces the six and seven foes of our souls and in the\ndefection of wisdom unless we worship the dwellings of the three gods how\nshall we attain happiness? The [forehead](errata.htm#38) mark, food and scars\non the body and daubings with ashes are in vain applied. Can the sons of earth\nhereby attain bliss through the love of these? O Vemana, the noblest of\nprinces?\n\n214\n\nIf thou be thyself converted into those three Brahma, Vishnu and Siva, who\ncreated, saved and destroy the three worlds and praise them, this man shall be\ntransformed into the deity.\n\n215\n\nHe who hath reduced Brahma, Vishnu and Siva in one shall become a _parama\nyogee_ and the divinity. How can we comprehend one who thus is equal to the\ndivinity.\n\n216\n\nThose who will not cease from the radical bond of the root (the mind) unless\nthey destroy the eight creeds, how should they be called sages, rather are\nthey mad.\n\np. 61\n\n217\n\nThe lingam is the great Siva; the life of the body if that creature be\npurified he shall attain God. Were there two paths how could the deity be\nattained?\n\n218\n\nSeize the robbers (passions) and put them to death; spare but one (the mind)\nwhoever he be that knows this secret, this shall be to him the fruit that he\nseeks.\n\n219\n\nLet us seize the four robbers (four lusts and smite them on the head, _cama_ ,\n_crodha_ , _lobha_ and _moha_ ) but spare one (the mind) to the men of the\nmind that they may attain the fruits of wisdom.\n\n220\n\nThe man who hath learnt to view the order of the secret charms of the six and\nthree temples, he shall attain the path to perfection. True is this doctrine.\n\np. 62\n\n221\n\nIf thou gain the favour of Siva and thereby destroy the first principle (\n_agnyana_ ) of thy tree (body) and cast it (ignorance) as its root ( _maya_ )\nand thus worship Siva, thou shalt be as a mountain and how should death befall\nthee?\n\n222\n\nHave you seen the three worlds, beheld and attained to the three objects that\npossess the three qualities and the beatitude that dwells there-in?\n\n223\n\nHe who looks upon rain, wind and sunshine as equal and abstains from thinking\nof honour or the like and continue in subjection--this is a stout hearted\nsaint (yogee).\n\n224\n\n(The _Parabramham_ ) Under this tree there is not even the least shade; If the\nwaters of delusion are unable to overflow this tree, it is as tree, how should\nthat tree die?\n\n225\n\np. 63\n\n(The power of delusion) Often in the midst of her reality shakes her head in\nscorn, she often laughs, she is no woman, what means woman? and What is the\nname of the being?\n\n226\n\n(mystic) When the five birds (passions) were found in their hole (the body)\nand cried, one of them sought the origin. The parrot that sought him became\nhim.\n\n227\n\nIf the unknown being by meditation appear in thy mind thereafter to say he is\ndead merely signifies his ultimate tie; when, thou die give up all earthy\nconnections and worship (Sarv\xc4\x93sa) the Lord of all (total obscurity).\n\n228\n\nThe words of Vemana, if soundly understood, are surely the essence of all the\nVedas. If thou do not invite and comprehend thy greatness in the five-lettered\nname shalt thou enjoy prosperity?\n\n229\n\nWisdom is the prime teacher to this whole world. The one _Pranava-mantra_ is\nthe original teacher (teacher of teachers) and thirdly, truly, the _Gayatri\nmantra_ is the teacher of our actions.\n\np. 64\n\n230\n\nIf thou understand the mystic syllable \' _Om_ \' (Pranava mantra) if it be in\nthy mind, the multitude of the acts of the mind shall not in the least affect\nthee. Then shall the devotee shine, a lamp of Divine knowledge.\n\n231\n\nUnderstand the power of the \'Om\', Pranava mantra--it is the lingam. It resides\nin the three persons. Can others (those who are without) know and worship it?\n\n232\n\nHe who hath united into one the composition of letters of the mystic syllable\n\'Om\', and the visible mundane egg, he shall enjoy that letter \'Om\'; and shall\nin certainty inherit bliss.\n\n233\n\nWhy thou hast truly entered into the import of the mystic form of letters in\n\'Om\' why persist in reading ten millions of other subjects? Fitly and visibly,\nshall the two letters Siva, constitute purity of soul in thee.\n\np. 65\n\n234\n\nThey who have rightly ordered their inner man, and considering justly the\nstate of their heart, thrust it away, these are men of understanding.\n[These](errata.htm#39) shall dwell in delight in heaven--(terribly difficult).\n\n235\n\nThey talk and talk of Divinity. What is in this Divinity? Were they to apply\nthemselves and understand and see he is close to them. They cannot perceive\nthe ( _mudricas_ ) shadows that flit before the eyes closed in meditation.\n\n236\n\nThe soul dwells in the little world of the corporal frame; and the sun\ninhabits the greater world of the universe and the divinity dwells in the\nsound, the globules of the splendour.\n\n237\n\nThe fair ( _nadam_ ) sound is produced from the (jyotee) visionary lights. The\nfair (bindu) globules are born from the nadam; and from the _bindu_ are earth\nand heaven born.\n\n238\n\np. 66\n\nAll those who comprehending in their mind the scheme (or knack) of gazing at\nthe sky (the khechari mudra) and who dispute not vainly these have subdued\ndelusion. Can it other-wise be subdued?\n\n239\n\nThe hooded serpent by knowing well to fix its gaze like as the crow under the\ncover gazes, thus does the yogee by inner wisdom gaze; this is the path of\nperfection.\n\n240\n\nHow subtle is the interior vision? Pure is the sight of sight. Equal to the\ndeity is the eye of our eye[.](errata.htm#40)\n\n241\n\nIf thou carefully fix thy sight on the top of thy nose, then does a man\ncorrectly view the pre-eminent. He who hath known the pre-eminent cutteth off\nall secular ties.\n\n242\n\nUnless he sees (i.e., comprehend) the divine name (the mystic syllable named\n_Pranava_ ), a man cannot become faithful Unless he behold the lights (\n_jyotees_ ) that appear to the closed eyes, he is not in the way. Unless he\nbehold the everlasting he is not in the state of beatitude.\n\np. 67\n\n248\n\nBy the _mudricas_ in the mind being rightly ordered, as thou gazest on the\n_linga_ of soul (the deity), it shall be manifested to thee and shall it be\nbestowed on thee devoid of teacher? That thou [should\'st](errata.htm#41)\nunderstand it?\n\n244\n\n(Mystic) By gazing at the blight mudras, happiness or sorrow is produced.\nLooking at the blessing of the mudras and enjoying it, thou shalt shine as a\nbeatified saint.\n\n245\n\nUnless thou dissolve the splendours of three affections, how should one attain\npermanent bliss in a fit manner? Unless thou annihilate thy mind can beatitude\nbe put into thy hand,\n\n246\n\nFixed in meditation, with eyes and ears closed, heard a ringing as of a bell\nin my mind; beholding I beheld a pure splendour and attaining the divinity. I\nbeheld it within me. This is no hypocrisy. Look then to me.\n\n247\n\np. 68\n\nBehold the ( _bayalu- \xc4\x81c\xc4\x81sa_) sky and consider that splendour, view the\ndeparture of that light, uninjured. He that can view uninjured shall stand\nunshaken.\n\n248\n\nLose not understanding behold the enlightening _calas_ \\--confuse not the\n_calas_ steadily behold the inner heaven ( _bayalu-antar \xc4\x81c\xc4\x81sa_); confuse not\nthat heaven and steadily thou shalt behold the divinity.\n\n249\n\nIn meditation if after gazing steadily thou persist not to the end, when thy\nsight fails again push on thy glance again. Him that fails unable to push it\non, they look on as very light person.\n\n250\n\n_Munees_ esteem the splendours that appear to the devotee fixed in meditation\nwonderful and excellent. If they understand, this is the chief spirit.\n\n251\n\nHe is no exalted sage who [cannot](errata.htm#42) view the globules or his\nringing sound, nor unite the splendours. Whatever pains he takes how shall he\nattain beatitude?\n\np. 69\n\n252\n\nLet us know the time of attaining the truth and thus become the eternal. Let\nus thoroughly attain the mystic form (bindu) that exists with (lit. in) the\nsound (nadam). Then shall we attain bliss, and participate with no others in\nthat enjoyment.\n\n253\n\nHe that can convert the _nadam_ into the _bindu_ and into the _nadam_ again,\nalso convert the _nadu_ , the _bindu_ , and the _kala_ into one (place) and\nperceive the sound, this man shall become the _yogee_ full of bliss.\n\n254\n\nThe devotee who knoweth the internal sound produced in meditation, shall with\njoy know the soul [within](errata.htm#43) him and attain felicity. That sound\nis the giver of beatitude, proclaim this for the consolation of all men.\n\n255\n\nThe yogee who knows the sound ( _nadam_ ) shall in his mind know the path\ndescribed in the _vedanta_ proclaim abroad that this sound is the means of\nbeatitude.\n\np. 70\n\n256\n\nLose the idea of "mine and thine" and be illustrious in the belief of exalted\nabstraction (nadam). By the absence of the belief and\n[disbelief](errata.htm#44), thou shalt attain prudence.\n\n257\n\nHe who through instruction hath attained the ( _nadam_ , _the bindu_ and _the\nkala_ ) ringing sound, the globules and the splendours, that he perceives who\nin meditation seals his eyes and ears, he who establishes these in his soul\nand well fixes his wandering mind, this is the mighty sage whose soul shall\nobtain its passage through the sagittal suture of the skull.\n\n258\n\nThe saint who knoweth the (nadam) ringing sound shall know the indivisible God\nand the mystic syllable. That is the seed of the five charactered name (\n_Namassivaya_ ). Proclaim to men that the _nadam_ in the mind is the\nbeatitude.\n\n259\n\nConvert the _nadam_ and _bindu_ into one _nadam_ and convert the nadam, the\nbindu and the kala into a single nadam, to meditate while beholding the nadam,\nthis is perfection.\n\np. 71\n\n260\n\nConsider what is the twenty sixth essence. It is a wondrous vital spirit. If\nthou unite it intimately with the chief spirit in the ( _gurupada_ ) cerebral\nsuture. Him who doth this they shall surely call saint.\n\n261\n\nEstablishing the six gods in the six limbs and fixing the chamber of the head\nfirm on the one pillar of the spine, the reckoning is to allow but one ruler\n(man) to each house.\n\n262\n\nThere are six sustainers of the earth. There are the six rulers, princes of\nthe earth. The noble and great warriors are these know that the body is their\nchariot and mark the result.\n\n263\n\nThe divinity ( _atma linga_ ) dwells in what is termed the _ajna chacra_ (the\nspace between the eyes). It is only by gazing intently on this part that\nshines so nobly, that beatitude shall be attained by men.\n\np. 72\n\n28 4\n\nCut down in thy soul the five chacras, nobly surmount those chacras and behold\nthe plain beyond them.\n\n265\n\nThe tree of beatitude has no (beginning) root but four fair boughs (forms of\nexistence, animal, vegetable, insects, minerals). It is open to view and\nproduces fruit. If thou eat them, they have no taste but cause appetite.\n\n266\n\nIn that house in the threshold of which three ways meet with air, in the place\nwhere those three meet cloth Siva dwell (mystic of the body--worthless).\n\n267\n\nHe who has the skill firmly to dwell in the six and three chacrams knowing\ntheir beauty he hath found the path to perfection.\n\n268\n\np. 73\n\nIf thou meditate in thy mind, in the sagittal suture shall there stand, He who\nis ruler of all to all who worship him does he give both sustenance and\nsalvation.\n\n269\n\nMind, words and works--if thou give up these three, and walk not up and down\nthe royal path (a mystic part of the body), then shall any loss befall the\nyogee?\n\n270\n\nHe who restraineth the six (lotuses) mortal parts of his body, and carefully\nfixeth his anus or backbone, and the parts above it and who also fixeth his\nmind is of course a twice born Brahmin.\n\n271\n\nGo and say, I have cast a great shame upon Vemana himself who named Vishnu and\ndisgraced Siva and even Brahma. Let the one God alone be honoured.\n\n272\n\np. 74\n\nAmong them who are not wetted with rain and them who are not those who relying\nnot on Vemana, follow not him (conduct themselves) wherever thou seek are not\nto be found. Never shall we see his equal.\n\n273\n\nAre there not eighty four lacs (84,00,000) of tribes of animals in all? As for\nthe manner of their production in the earth, is he indeed that hath described\nit in your hearing, still to be called the mad Vemana.\n\n274\n\nHe has thrown away his caste as water and slain his teachers (as Bheeshma in\nBh\xc4\x81rata) and nobly lied lies as big as elephants. Yet his name is just king--a\ngreat _Vepa_ seed, bitter and worthless,\n\n275\n\nLocomotive animals all, till death, eat all excellent tasted things without\nleaving them, But immovable animals (hills and trees) are ever dropping their\npride sorrowing remain.\n\n276\n\np. 75\n\nYou will say "We are versed in the knowledge of God" Ask yourselves--what is\nthe meaning of Divinity? Tell, if you know whether he be whiteness, blackness\nor redness?\n\n277\n\nHe knoweth not what sort of man he is, He knoweth not his former birth. For so\ndebased a life why should be so careful? He knoweth not that this world is but\nan ( _maya_ ) illusion of Ishwara!\n\n278\n\nHe who wanders the various lands under the titles of the stranger, the\nrecluse, of the noble Ganga of a hill or in the character of a man of\nexceeding beauty is yet one sole spirit of life.\n\n279\n\nSurely a teacher is requisite in the Siva creed and a teacher is evidently\nrequisite in the Vishnu faith. What can the wretch of a debased nature learn\nwithout a teacher?\n\n280\n\np. 76\n\nSurya lover of the lotus, was born in the race of Vishnu, husband of Lakshmi,\nthe noble mother and as he duly goes his course, going about the lands and the\nearth; Vishnu nourisher of the elephant, travels as he does (for Surya is in\nreality but a form of Vishnu).\n\n281\n\nLet us know the source of the three Gods. First know one of the three, Then\nfitly with thy tongue offer praise.\n\n282\n\nThe water in which the race of saints came plunging in defiled it. In which\neven Brahma being immersed cannot lift his head out of it. All men, whatever\nare plunged in this pond upto the middle.\n\n283\n\nBy means of ambrosia all become stable. But if we seek ambrosia none can find\nit; ambrosia turns into venom--what a marvel this is!\n\n284\n\nKnow well that this world is partly black, partly red, partly white (the three\n_gunas_ \\--tamas, rajas, satwa). What is the reason that it should be all\nalike?\n\np. 77\n\n285\n\nThe ultimate has no lameness in his foot; He has no name in the dispute of his\nworld. Understand that this is the bliss of others.\n\n286\n\nHe was wonderfully born in the Brahmin class and being sunk in sin flowed\nthence into the other castes. Though born in the lotus, the sole of his foot\nis not wetted with the holy stream.\n\n287\n\nThe king of hills (Himavat) is his father-in-law, the daughter of he hill\n(Parvathi) is his wife; a hill Kailas is his home; and gold hill, _meru_ , his\nbow. Thus O Siva, thou art Lord of Hills. How art thou still given to such go\nbetween practices. (This is a sneer at sexual love originating in the\ncreator).\n\n288\n\nThe house is worldly connections, the bow is his weapon. The Five--lettered\nGod is mother of redemption but all uniting with woman is but a lie.\n\n289\n\np. 78\n\nIf you [twitch](errata.htm#45) off a head of Brahma, they call it murdering\nBrahma. Brahma is a Vysya (a man of the third class), is he a Brahmin? If\nBrahma had even died would Siva become a Brahmin slayer. (This is an allusion\nto the base of the lingam representing Brahma).\n\n290\n\nSiva assumed the shape of the sharabha and slew Narasimha; which\n([masculine](errata.htm#46), _y \xc4\x93di_) God is greater than Siva? Where is there\none more worthy to be looked to?\n\n291\n\nSeeing that Vishnu abhorred not himself to be born in ten incarnations, to\ngrow in them as to delight in them; if then thou do away the lustre of the\nnoble married state shall thou hereby become one of the excellent.\n\n292\n\nAgajata (Paravati) causes him (Siva) who gave her half his body (see the\nmythology) to be slain (i.e., her worship as shacti, supersedes his)? If he\ncannot revenge this cruel is he man and not a woman?\n\n293\n\np. 79\n\nThe Veda is on every subject (words of the choultry). The signification of the\nVeda is a refuge (a branch of hold). Its rules are worthy to be known.\nProclaim it consolingly in the world that the sound produced by closing the\nears is subject to the state of meditation.\n\n294\n\nHe who has seen the similarity of every generation and by wisdom knows the\nnature of the bathing, eating and lying in each, that man who thus knows how\nto walk is the _grihasta_ (i.e., a perfectly virtuous man of the world).\n\n295\n\nIf defilement attaches to food, it attaches also to the soul that thereby\nsubsists. Food that is digested within us (let our soul) this is defilement.\nFood is the purification of the soul and the soul the purifier of the food.\nThus united as the earth and sky are.\n\n296\n\nDaily does defilement flow down through the nine [orifices](errata.htm#47), If\nthis defilement of humanity be done away, man dies; foulness that never dies\nis produced in the loins.\n\n297\n\np. 80\n\nHeedless of foulness and impurity, they eat three times a day, and worship him\nwho sports within the soul (Brahma). He who thus attains the future life is\nthe complete _yogee_.\n\n298\n\nThat pious man who delights in bestowing house, garden, and field on Brahmins,\nlong shall he rule the earth, and be filled with enjoyments.\n\n299\n\nThe property given by a Brahmin to a Brahmin, though it be highly fruitful,\nyet cannot be enjoyed by a lord of earth (Brahmin). He must quit it.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 300-399](vov05.htm)\n\n'
