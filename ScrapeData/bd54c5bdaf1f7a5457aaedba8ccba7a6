It procures prosperity.\n\n3\\. It is sacred to Agni, or to the Manes, or to Pra _g_ apati, or to the\nSeasons, or to the Vi _s_ ve devas\xc2\x97thus the deity (to which the Ash _t_ aka is\nsacred), is investigated (by different teachers).\n\n4. 4 There are four Ash _t_ akas in (the four months of) the winter;\n\n5\\. These all he should endeavour to celebrate with (offerings of) meat;\n\n6\\. Thus says Kautsa.\n\n7\\. (There are only) three Ash _t_ akas (in the winter), says Audgahamani,\n\n8\\. And so say (also) Gautama and Varkakha _n_ _d_ i.\n\n9\\. The eighth day of the dark fortnight after the \xc3\x82grahaya _n_ i is called\nApupash _t_ aka (i.e. Ash _t_ aka of the cakes).\n\n10. 10 Having prepared grains in the way prescribed\n\np. 98\n\nfor Sthalipakas, he cooks (those grains and prepares thus) a _k_ aru.\n\n11. 11 And (besides he prepares) eight cakes, without turning them over in the dish (in which he bakes them);\n\n12\\. (Each) in one dish;\n\n13\\. Without Mantras, according to Audgahamani;\n\n14. 14 Of the size of the (cakes) sacred to Tryambaka.\n\n15\\. After he has baked them, he should pour (\xc3\x82 _g_ ya) on them, should take\nthem from the fire towards the north, and should pour (\xc3\x82 _g_ ya) on them\nagain.\n\n16. 16 In the way prescribed for Sthalipakas he cuts off (the prescribed portions) from the mess of boiled grains and from the cakes, and sacrifices with (the words), 'To the Ash _t_ aka Svaha!'\n\n17. 17 The rest (should be performed) according to the Sthalipaka rite.\n\n18. 18 (At the second Ash _t_ aka, on) the eighth day after the full-moon day of Taisha, a cow (is sacrificed).\n\n19\\. Shortly before the time of junction (of day and night, i.e. before the\nmorning twilight) he should place that (cow) to the east of the fire, and when\n(that time) has come, he should sacrifice (\xc3\x82 _g_ ya) with\n\np. 99\n\n[paragraph continues] (the verse), 'What, O beasts, you think' (MB. II, 2, 5).\n\n20\\. And after having sacrificed, he should recite over (the cow the verse),\n'May thy mother give leave to thee' (ibid. 6).\n\n21\\. Let him sprinkle (the cow) with water in which barley is, with (the\nwords), 'Agreeable to the Ash _t_ aka I sprinkle thee.'\n\n22\\. Let him carry a fire-brand round it with (the verse), 'The lord of goods,\nthe sage (goes) round' (Sama-veda I, 30).\n\n23\\. Let him give it water to drink.\n\n24\\. The remainder of what it has drunk he should pour out under (the feet of)\nthe beast with (the formula), 'Away from the gods the Havis has been taken'\n(MB. II, 2, 7).\n\n25\\. They then walk in a northerly direction (from the fire) and kill (the\ncow),\n\n26\\. The head of which is turned to the east, the feet to the north, if the\nrite is sacred to the gods,\n\n27\\. The head to the south, the feet to the west, if the rite is sacred to the\nManes.\n\n28\\. After it has been killed, he should sacrifice (\xc3\x82 _g_ ya) with (the\nverse), 'If the beast has lowed' (ibid. 8).\n\n29\\. And (the sacrificer's) wife should get water and should wash all the\napertures of the cow's body.\n\n30\\. They lay two purifiers (i.e. grass-blades) on (the cow's body) near its\nnavel, cut it up in the direction of its hairs, and draw the omentum out.\n\n31\\. He should spit it on two pieces of wood, on one (simple) branch and on\nanother forked branch, should besprinkle it (with water), and should roast it.\n\np. 100\n\n32. 32 When it has ceased to drop, he should say, 'Hew the (cow) to pieces\xc2\x97\n\n33\\. 'So that the blood does not stain the ground to the east of the fire.'\n\n34\\. After he has roasted (the omentum), he should pour (\xc3\x82 _g_ ya) on it,\nshould take it from the fire towards the north, and should pour (\xc3\x82 _g_ ya) on\nit again.\n\n35. 35 After he has cut off (the prescribed portions from) the omentum in the way prescribed for Sthalipakas, or in the way prescribed for the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t (oblation), he sacrifices with (the words), 'To the Ash _t_ aka Svaha!'\n\n36. 36 The rest (should be performed) according to the Sthalipaka rite. The rest according to the Sthalipaka rite.\n\nEnd of the Third Prapa _th_ aka.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[97:1](sbe30032.htm#fr_339) 10, 1 seq.
