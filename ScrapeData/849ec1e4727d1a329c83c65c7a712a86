Of these, yama is of ten kinds: and\nso is niyama. There are eight \xc4\x81sanas. Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81ma is of three kinds; pra\xe1\xb9\xady\xc4\x81h\xc4\x81ra\nis of five kinds: so also is \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81. \xe1\xb8\x8chy\xc4\x81na is of two kinds, and sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi is\nof one kind only.\n\n"Under yama (forbearance) are ten: 1 ahims\xc4\x81, sa\xe1\xb9\xadya, as\xe1\xb9\xadeya brahmacharya, \xe1\xb8\x8day\xc4\x81,\n\xc4\x81rjava, ksham\xc4\x81, \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadi, mi\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81h\xc4\x81ra, and \xc5\x9baucha. Of these, ahims\xc4\x81 is the not\ncausing of any pain to any living being at any time through the actions of\none\'s mind, speech, or body. Sa\xe1\xb9\xadya is the speaking of the truth that conduces\nto the well-being of creatures, through the actions of one\'s mind, speech, or\nbody. As\xe1\xb9\xadeya is not coveting of another\'s property through the actions of\none\'s mind, speech, or body. Brahmacharya is the refraining from sexual\nintercourse in all places and in all states in mind, speech or body. \xe1\xb8\x8cay\xc4\x81 is\nkindliness towards all creatures in all places. \xc4\x80rjava is the preserving of\nequanimity of mind, speech, or body in the performance or non-performance of\nthe actions ordained or forbidden to be done. Ksham\xc4\x81 is the bearing patiently\nof all pleasant or unpleasant things, such as praise or blow. Dh\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadi is\n\np. 174\n\nthe preserving of firmness of mind during the period of gain or loss of wealth\nor relatives. Mi\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81h\xc4\x81ra is the taking of oily and sweet food, leaving one-\nfourth of the stomach empty. \xc5\x9aaucha is of two kinds, external and internal. Of\nthese, the external is the cleansing of the body by earth and water; the\ninternal is the cleansing of the mind. This (the latter) is to be obtained by\nmeans of the a\xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadma-vi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81 (science of Self).\n\n"Under niyama (religious observances), are ten, _viz_., \xe1\xb9\xadapas, san\xe1\xb9\xadosha,\n\xc4\x81s\xe1\xb9\xadikya, \xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81na, \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvarap\xc5\xabjana, si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada-\xc5\x9brava\xe1\xb9\x87a, hr\xc4\xab\xe1\xb8\xa5, ma\xe1\xb9\xadi, japa, and vra\xe1\xb9\xada.\nOf these \xe1\xb9\xadapas, is the emancipation of the body through the observances of\nsuch penances as k\xe1\xb9\x9bchchhra, ch\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb8\x8dr\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a, etc., according to rules. San\xe1\xb9\xadosha is\nbeing satisfied with whatever comes to us of its own accord. \xc4\x80s\xe1\xb9\xadikya is the\nbelief in the merits or demerits of actions as stated in the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das. \xe1\xb8\x8c\xc4\x81na is\nthe giving with faith to deserving persons, money, grains, etc., earned\nlawfully. \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvarap\xc5\xabjana is the worshipping of Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u, Ru\xe1\xb8\x8dra, etc., with pure\nmind according to one\'s power. Si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada-\xc5\x9brava\xe1\xb9\x87a is the inquiry into the\nsignificance of Ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada. Hr\xc4\xab\xe1\xb8\xa5 is the shame felt in the performance of things\ncontrary to the rules of the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das and of society. Ma\xe1\xb9\xadi is the faith in the\npaths laid down by the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das. Japa is the practising of the man\xe1\xb9\xadras into which\none is duly initiated by his spiritual instructor, and which is not against\n(the rules of) the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das. It is of two kinds--the spoken and the mental. The\nmental is associated with contemplation by the mind. The spoken is of two\nkinds--the loud and the low. The loud pronunciation gives the reward as stated\n(in the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das): (while) the low one (gives) a reward thousand times (that).\nThe mental (gives) a reward a crore (of times that). Vra\xe1\xb9\xada is the regular\nobservance of or the refraining from the actions enjoined or prohibited by the\nVe\xe1\xb8\x8das.\n\n"\xc4\x80sanas (the postures) are (chiefly) eight, _viz_., svas\xe1\xb9\xadika, gomukha, pa\xe1\xb8\x8dma,\nv\xc4\xabra, simha, bha\xe1\xb8\x8dra, muk\xe1\xb9\xada, and may\xc5\xabra.\n\n"Svas\xe1\xb9\xadika is the sitting at ease with the body erect, placing each foot\nbetween the thighs and knees of the other. Gomukha is (the sitting at ease\nwith the body erect,) placing the hollow\n\np. 175\n\nof the left foot under the side of the right posteriors and the hollow of the\nright foot under the side of the left posteriors, resembling Gomukha (cow\'s\nface). Pa\xe1\xb8\x8dma is (the sitting at ease with the body erect) placing the back of\neach foot in the thigh of the other, the right hand grasping the right toe and\nthe left hand the left toe. This, O \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87dilya, is praised by all. V\xc4\xabra is the\nsitting at ease (with the body erect), placing one foot (on the thigh of the\nother and the other foot underneath the corresponding (opposite thigh.) Simha\nis (the sitting at ease with the body erect,) pressing the right side (of the\nthigh) with the hollow of left heel and _vice versa_. Rest your hands on the\nknees, spread out the fingers, open your mouth and carefully fix your gaze on\nthe tip of your nose. This is always praised by the yogins. Si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dha 1 is (the\nsitting at ease with the body erect), pressing the perineum with the left heel\nand placing the heel of the right foot above the genital organ, concentrating\nthe mind between the two eyebrows. Bha\xe1\xb8\x8dra is (the sitting at ease with the\nbody erect,)pressing the two ankles of the two feet firmly together against\nthe S\xc4\xabvin\xc4\xab ( _viz_., lower part of the seed) and binding the knees firmly with\nthe hands. This is the bha\xe1\xb8\x8dra which destroys all diseases and poisons. Muk\xe1\xb9\xada\nis (the sitting at ease with the body erect,) pressing with the left heel the\nright side of the tender part of the S\xc4\xabvin\xc4\xab, and with the right heel the left\nside of the tender part of the S\xc4\xabvin\xc4\xab. May\xc5\xabra--(lit., peacock). Rest your body\nupon the ground with both palms and place your elbows on the sides of the\nnavel, lift up the head and feet and remain like a stick in the air, (like the\nplant balance in gymnastics). This is the may\xc5\xabra posture which destroys all\nsins. By these, all the diseases within the body are destroyed; all the\npoisons are digested. Let the person who is unable to practise all these\npostures betake himself to any one (of these) which he may find easy and\npleasant. He who conquers (or gets mastery over) the postures--he conquers the\nthree worlds. A person who has the practice of yama and niyama should practise\npr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81ma; by that the n\xc4\x81dis become purified."\n\nThen \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87dilya questioned A\xe1\xb9\xadharvan thus: "By what means are the n\xc4\x81dis purified?\nHow many are they in number?\n\np. 176\n\n[paragraph continues] How do they arise? What v\xc4\x81yus (vital airs) are located\nin them? What are their seats? What are their functions? Whatever is worthy of\nbeing known in the body, please tell me." To that A\xe1\xb9\xadharvan replied (thus):\n"This body is ninety-six digits in length. Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a extends twelve digits beyond\nthe body. He who through the practice of yoga reduces his pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a within his\nbody to make it equal to or not less than the fire in it becomes the greatest\nof the yogins. In men, the region of fire which is triangular in form and\nbrilliant as the molten gold is situated in the middle of the body. In four-\nfooted animals, it (fire) is quadrangular. In birds, it is round. In its (the\nregion of fire\'s) centre, the purifying, beneficial, and subtle flame is\nsituate. Two digits above the anus and two digits below the sexual organ is\nthe centre of the body for men. For four-footed animals, it is the middle of\nthe heart. For birds, it is the middle of the body. Nine digits from (or\nabove) the centre of the body and four digits in length and breadth is\nsituated an oval form. In its midst is the navel. In it, is situated the\nchakra ( _viz_., wheel) with twelve spokes. In the middle of the chakra, the\nj\xc4\xabva (\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81) wanders, driven by its good and bad deeds. As a spider flies to\nand fro within a web of fine threads, so pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a moves about here. In this body,\nthe j\xc4\xabva rides upon pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a. Lying in the middle of the navel and above it, is\nthe seat of kun\xe1\xb8\x8dalin\xc4\xab. The kun\xe1\xb8\x8dalin\xc4\xab \xc5\x9bak\xe1\xb9\xadi is of the form of eight prak\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadis\n(matter) and coils itself eight ways or (times). The movement of v\xc4\x81yus (vital\nairs) checks duly the food and drink all round by the side of skan\xe1\xb8\x8dha. 1 It\ncloses by its head (the opening of) the brahmaran\xe1\xb8\x8dhra, and during the time of\n(the practice of) yoga is awakened by the fire (in the ap\xc4\x81na); then it shines\nwith great brilliancy in the \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b of the heart in the shape of wisdom.\nDepending upon kun\xe1\xb8\x8dalin\xc4\xab which is situated in the centre, there are fourteen\nprincipal n\xc4\x81dis ( _viz_.,) Id\xc4\x81, Pi\xe1\xb9\x85gal\xc4\x81, Sushumn\xc4\x81, Sarasva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab, V\xc4\x81ru\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\xab, P\xc5\xabsh\xc4\x81,\nHas\xe1\xb9\xadijihv\xc4\x81, Ya\xc5\x9basvin\xc4\xab, Vi\xc5\x9bvo\xe1\xb8\x8dhar\xc4\xab, Kuh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb8\xa5, \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x85khin\xc4\xab, Payasvin\xc4\xab, Alambus\xc4\x81, and\nG\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81r\xc4\xab. Of them, Sushumn\xc4\x81 is said to be the\n\np. 177\n\nsustainer of the universe and the path of salvation. Situated at the back of\nthe anus, it is attached to the spinal column and extends to the brahmaran\xe1\xb8\x8dhra\nof the head and is invisible and subtle and is vaish\xe1\xb9\x87av\xc4\xab (or has the \xc5\x9bak\xe1\xb9\xadi\nforce of Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u). On the left of Sushumn\xc4\x81 is situated Id\xc4\x81, and on the right is\nPi\xe1\xb9\x85gal\xc4\x81. The moon moves in Id\xc4\x81 and the sun in Pi\xe1\xb9\x85gal\xc4\x81. The moon is of the\nnature of \xe1\xb9\xadamas and the sun of rajas. The poison share is of the sun and the\nnectar of the moon. They both direct (or indicate) time and Sushumn\xc4\x81 is the\nenjoyer (or consumer) of time. To the back and on the side of Sushumn\xc4\x81 are\nsituate Sarasva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab and Kuh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb8\xa5 respectively. Between Ya\xc5\x9basvin\xc4\xab and Kuh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb8\xa5 stands\nV\xc4\x81ru\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\xab. Between Pasha and Sarasva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab lies Payasvin\xc4\xab. 1 Between G\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81r\xc4\xab and\nSarasva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab is situated Ya\xc5\x9basvin\xc4\xab. 2 In the centre of the navel is Alambus\xc4\x81. In\nfront of Sushumn\xc4\x81 there is Kuh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb8\xa5, which proceeds as far as the genital organ.\nAbove and below kun\xe1\xb8\x8dalin\xc4\xab is situated V\xc4\x81ru\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\xab, which proceeds everywhere.\nYa\xc5\x9basvin\xc4\xab which is beautiful (or belonging to the moon), proceeds to the great\ntoes. Pi\xe1\xb9\x85gal\xc4\x81 goes upwards to the right nostril. Payasvin\xc4\xab goes to right ear.\nSarasva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab goes to the upper part or the tongue and \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x85khin\xc4\xab to the left ear,\n(while) G\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81r\xc4\xab goes from the back of Id\xc4\x81 to the left eye. Alambus\xc4\x81 goes\nupwards and downwards from the root of the anus. From these fourteen n\xc4\x81dis,\nother (minor) n\xc4\x81dis spring; from them springing others, and from them\nspringing others; so it should be known. As the leaf of the a\xc5\x9bva\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadha tree (\n_ficus religiosa_ ) etc., is covered with minute fibres so also is this body\npermeated with n\xc4\x81dis.\n\n"Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a, Ap\xc4\x81na, Sam\xc4\x81na, U\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81na, Vy\xc4\x81na, Naga, Karma, K\xe1\xb9\x9bkara, Deva\xe1\xb8\x8da\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada, and\n\xe1\xb8\x8chana\xc3\xb1jaya--these ten v\xc4\x81yus (vital airs) move in all the n\xc4\x81dis. Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a moves in\nthe nostrils, the throat, the navel, the two great toes and the lower and the\nupper parts of kun\xe1\xb8\x8dalin\xc4\xab. Vy\xc4\x81na moves in the ear, the eye, the loins, the\nankles, the nose, the throat and the buttocks. Ap\xc4\x81na moves in the anus, the\ngenitals, the thighs, the knees. the stomach, the seeds, the loins, the\ncalves, the navel, and the\n\np. 178\n\nseat of the anus of fire. U\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81na lives in all the joints and also in the hands\nand legs. Sam\xc4\x81na lives, permeating in all parts of the body. Along with the\nfire in the body, it causes the food and drink taken in, to spread in the\nbody. It moves in the seventy-two thousand n\xc4\x81dis and pervades all over the\nbody along with the fire. The five v\xc4\x81yus beginning with Naga go towards the\nskin, the bones, etc. The Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a which is in the navel separates the food and\ndrink which is there and brings about the rasas (juices) and others. 1 Placing\nthe water above the fire and the food above (or in) the water, it goes to the\nAp\xc4\x81na and along with it, fans up the fire in the centre of the body. The fire\nthus fanned up by the Ap\xc4\x81na gradually increases in brightness in the middle of\nthe body. Then it causes through its flames the water which is brought in the\nbowels by the Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a to grow hot. The fire with the water causes the food and\ncondiments, which are placed above, to be boiled to a proper degree. Then\nPr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a separates these into sweat, urine, water, blood, semen, the faeces and\nthe like. And along with the Samaria, it takes the juice (or essence) to all\nthe n\xc4\x81dis and moves in the body in the shape of breath. The v\xc4\x81yus excrete the\nurine, the faeces, etc., through the nine openings in the body which are\nconnected with the outside air. The functions of Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a are inspiration,\nexpiration, and cough. Those of Ap\xc4\x81na are the excretion of the faeces and the\nurine. Those of Vy\xc4\x81na are (such actions as) giving and taking. Those of U\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81na\nare keeping the body straight, etc. Those of Sam\xc4\x81na are nourishing the body.\nThose of N\xc4\x81ga are vomiting, etc.; of K\xc5\xabrma, the movement of the eyelids; of\nK\xe1\xb9\x9bkara, the causing of hunger, etc., of \xe1\xb8\x8ceva\xe1\xb8\x8da\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada, idleness, etc., and\n\xe1\xb8\x8chana\xc3\xb1jaya, phlegm.\n\n"Having thus acquired a thorough knowledge of the seat of the n\xc4\x81dis and of the\nv\xc4\x81yus with their functions, one should begin with the purification of the\nn\xc4\x81dis. A person possessed of yama and niyama, avoiding all company, having\nfinished his course of study, delighting in truth and virtue, having conquered\n(his) anger, being engaged in the service of his spiritual instructor and\nhaving been obedient to his parents\n\np. 179\n\nand well instructed in all the religious practices and the knowledge of his\norder of life, should go to a sacred grove abounding in fruits, roots, and\nwater. There he should select a pleasant spot always resounding with the\nchanting of the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das, frequented by the knowers of Brahman that persevere in\nthe duties of their orders of life and filled with fruits, roots, flowers, and\nwater. (Else) either in a temple or on the banks of a river or in a village or\nin a town, he should build a beautiful monastery. It should be neither too\nlong nor too high, should have a small door, should be besmeared well with\ncow-dung and should have every sort of protection. 1 There listening to the\nexposition of ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada, he should begin to practise yoga, In the beginning\nhaving worshipped Vin\xc4\x81yaka 2 (Ga\xe1\xb9\x87e\xc5\x9ba), he should salute his Ishta-\xe1\xb8\x8ceva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81\n(tutelary deity) and sitting in any of the above-mentioned postures on a soft\nseat, facing either the east or the north and having conquered them, the\nlearned man keeping his head and neck erect and fixing his gaze on the tip of\nhis nose, should see the sphere of the moon between his eyebrows and drink the\nnectar (flowing therefrom through his eyes. Inhaling the air through Id\xc4\x81 3 for\nthe space of twelve m\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81s, 4 he should contemplate on the sphere of fire 5\nsituated in the belly as surrounded with flames and having as its seed \xe0\xa4\xb0 (ra);\nthen he should exhale it through Pi\xe1\xb9\x85gal\xc4\x81. Again inhaling it through Pi\xe1\xb9\x85gal\xc4\x81 3\nand retaining it (within), he should exhale it through Id\xc4\x81. For the period of\ntwenty-eight months, 6 he should practise six times at every sitting through\nthe three san\xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81s (morning, noon, and evening)\n\np. 180\n\nand during the intervals. By this, the n\xc4\x81dis become purified. Then the body\nbecomes light and bright, the (gastric) fire is increased (within) and there\nis the manifestation of n\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da (internal sound).\n\n"Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81ma is said to be the union of Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a and Ap\xc4\x81na. It is of three kinds--\nexpiration, inspiration, and cessation. They are associated with the letters\nof the (Samsk\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xad) alphabet 1 (for the right performance of pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81ma).\nTherefore Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava (Om) only is said to be Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81ma. Sitting in the pa\xe1\xb8\x8dma\nposture, the person should meditate that there is at the tip of his nose\nG\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\xab, 2 a girl of red complexion surrounded by the numberless rays of the\nimage of the moon and mounted on a hamsa (swan) and having a mace in her hand.\nShe is the visible symbol of the letter A. The letter U has as its visible\nsymbol S\xc4\x81vi\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\xab, 2 a young woman of white colour having a disk in her hand and\nriding on a garuda (eagle). The letter M has as its visible symbol Sarasva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab,\n2 an aged woman of black colour riding on a bull, having a trident in her\nhand. He should meditate that the single letter--the supreme light--the\npra\xe1\xb9\x87ava (Om)--is the origin or source of these three letters A, U, and M.\nDrawing up the air through Id\xc4\x81 for the space of sixteen m\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81s, he should\nmeditate on the letter A during that time; retaining the inspired air for the\nspace of sixty-four m\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81s, he should meditate on the letter U during the\ntime; he should then exhale the inspired air for the space of thirty-two\nm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81s, meditating on the letter M during that time. He should practise this\nin the above order over and over again.\n\n"Then having become firm in the posture and preserved perfect self-control,\nthe yogin should, in order to clear away the impurities of the Sushumn\xc4\x81, sit\nin the pa\xe1\xb8\x8dm\xc4\x81sana (pa\xe1\xb8\x8dma posture), and having inhaled the air through the left\nnostril, should retain it as long as he can and should exhale it through the\nright. Then drawing it again through the right and having retained it, he\nshould exhale it through the left in the order\n\np. 181\n\nthat he should draw it through the same nostril by which he exhaled it before\nand retained it. In this context, occur (to memory) the following verses: "In\nthe beginning having inhaled the breath (Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a) through the left nostril,\naccording to the rule, he should exhale it through the other; then having\ninhaled the air through the right nostril, should retain it and exhale it\nthrough the other." To those who practise according to these rules through the\nright and left nostrils, the n\xc4\x81dis become purified within three months. He\nshould practise cessation of breath at sunrise, in the midday, at sunset and\nat midnight slowly till eighty (times a day) for four weeks. In the early\nstages, perspiration is produced; in the middle stage the tremor of the body,\nand in the last stage levitation in the air. These (results) ensue out of the\nrepression of the breath, while sitting in the pa\xe1\xb8\x8dma posture. When\nperspiration arises with effort, he should rub his body well. By this, the\nbody becomes firm and light. In the early course of his practice, food with\nmilk and ghee is excellent. One sticking to this rule becomes firm in his\npractice and gets no \xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81pa (or burning sensation in the body). As lions,\nelephants and tigers are gradually tamed, so also the breath, when rightly\nmanaged (comes under control); else it kills the practitioner. 1\n\n"He should (as far as is consistent with his health and safety) properly\nexhale it, properly inhale it or retain it properly. Thus (only) will he\nattain success. By thus retaining the breath in an approved manner and by the\npurification of the n\xc4\x81dis, the brightening of the (gastric) fire, the hearing\ndistinctly of (spiritual) sounds and (good) health result. When the nervous\ncentres have become purified through the regular practice of Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81ma, the\nair easily forces its way up through the mouth of the Sushumn\xc4\x81 which is in the\nmiddle. By the contraction of the muscles of the neck and by the contraction\nof the one below ( _viz_.,) Ap\xc4\x81na, the Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a (breath) goes into the Sushumn\xc4\x81\nwhich is in the middle from the west n\xc4\x81di. 2 Drawing\n\np. 182\n\nup the Ap\xc4\x81na and forcing down the Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a from the throat, the yogin free from\nold age becomes a youth of sixteen.\n\n"Seated in a pleasant posture and drawing up the air through the right nostril\nand retaining it inside from the top of the hair to the toe nails, he should\nexhale it through the same nostril. Through it, the brain becomes purified and\nthe diseases in the air n\xc4\x81dis are destroyed. Drawing up the air through the\nnostrils with noise (so as to fill the space) from the heart to the neck, and\nhaving retained it (within) as long as possible, he should exhale it through\nthe nose. Through this, hunger, thirst, idleness and sleep do not arise.\n\n"Taking in the air through the mouth (wide open) and having retained it as\nlong as possible, he should expel it through the nose. Through this, (such\ndiseases as) gulma, pleeha (both being splenetic diseases), bile and fever as\nalso hunger, etc., are destroyed.\n\n"Now we shall proceed to kumbhaka (restraint of breath). It is of two kinds--\nsahi\xe1\xb9\xada and kevala. That which is coupled with expiration and inspiration is\ncalled sahi\xe1\xb9\xada. That which is devoid of these is called kevala (alone). Until\nyou become perfect in kevala, practise sahi\xe1\xb9\xada. To one who has mastered kevala,\nthere is nothing unattainable in the three worlds. By kevala-restraint of\nbreath, the knowledge of kun\xe1\xb8\x8dalin\xc4\xab arises. Then he becomes lean in body,\nserene in face and clear-eyed, hears the (spiritual) sounds distinctly,\nbecomes free from all diseases and conquers his (bin\xe1\xb8\x8du) seminal fluid, 1 his\ngastric fire being increased. 2\n\n"Centring one\'s mind on an inward object whilst his eyes are looking outside\nwithout the shutting and opening of his eyelids, has been called\nVaish\xe1\xb9\x87av\xc4\xabmu\xe1\xb8\x8dr\xc4\x81. This is kept hidden in all the\n\np. 183\n\n[paragraph continues] \xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xadric works. With his mind and breath absorbed in an\ninternal object, the yogin, though he does not really see the objects outside\nand under him, still (appears to) see them with eyes in which the pupils are\nmotionless. This is called Khechar\xc4\xabmu\xe1\xb8\x8dr\xc4\x81. It has as its sphere of extension\none object and is very beneficial. (Then) the real seat of Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u, which is\nvoid and non-void, dawns on him. With eyes half closed and with a firm mind,\nfixing his eyes on the tip of his nose and becoming absorbed in the sun and\nmoon, he after remaining thus unshaken (becomes conscious of) the thing which\nis of the form of light, which is free from all externals, which is\nresplendent, which is the supreme truth and which is beyond. O \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87dilya, know\nthis to be \xe1\xb9\xaca\xe1\xb9\xad (That). Merging the sound in the light and elevating the brows\na little, this is of the way of (or is a part of) the former practice. This\nbrings about the state of Unmani which causes the destruction of the mind.\nTherefore he should practise the Khechar\xc4\xabmu\xe1\xb8\x8dr\xc4\x81. Then he attains to the state\nof Unman\xc4\xab and falls into the yoga sleep (trance). To one who obtains this yoga\nsleep, time does not exist. Placing the mind in the midst of \xc5\x9bak\xe1\xb9\xadi and \xc5\x9bak\xe1\xb9\xadi 1\nin the midst of the mind and looking on the mind with the mind, O \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81ndilya be\nhappy. Place the \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadma in the midst of \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b and \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b in the midst of \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, and\nhaving reduced everything to \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, do not think of anything else. You should\nnot (then) entertain thoughts, either external or internal. Abandoning all\nthoughts, become abstract thought itself. As camphor in fire and salt in water\nbecome absorbed, so also the mind becomes absorbed in the \xe1\xb9\xaca\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva (Truth). What\nis termed manas (mind) is the knowledge of everything that is known and its\nclear apprehension. When the knowledge and the object cognised are lost alike,\nthere is no second path (or that is the only path). By its giving up all\ncognition of objects, it (the mind) is absorbed and when the mind is absorbed,\nkaivalya (isolation) alone remains.\n\n"For the destruction of the chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada, there are two ways--yoga and j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na. O\nprince of sages! yoga is the (forcible)\n\np. 184\n\nrepression of the modifications of the mind, and j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na is the thorough inquiry\ninto them. When the modifications of the mind are repressed, it (the mind)\nverily obtains peace. Just as the actions of the people cease with the\nstopping of the fluctuations of the sun ( _viz_., with sunset), so when the\nfluctuations of the mind cease, this cycle of births and deaths comes to an\nend. (Then) the fluctuations of pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a are prevented, when one has no longing\nfor this mundane existence or when he has gratified his desires therein--\nthrough the study of religious books, the company of good men, indifference\n(to enjoyments), practice and yoga or long contemplation with intentness on\nany desired (higher) object or through practising one truth firmly.\n\n"By the repression of the breath through inhalation, etc., by continual\npractice therein which does not cause fatigue, and by meditating in a secluded\nplace, the fluctuations of the mind are arrested. Through the right\nrealisation of the true nature of the sound which is at the extreme end of the\npronunciation of the syllable Om ( _viz_., Ar\xe1\xb8\x8dham\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81), and when sushup\xe1\xb9\xadi\n(dreamless sleeping state) is rightly cognised through consciousness, the\nfluctuations of pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a are repressed. When the passage at the root of the\npalate which is like the bell, _viz_., uvula, is closed by the tongue with\neffort and when the breath goes up through (the upper hole), then the\nfluctuations of pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a are stopped. When the consciousness (samvi\xe1\xb9\xad) is merged\nin pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a, and when through practice the pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a goes through the upper hole into\nthe \xe1\xb8\x8dv\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8das\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada 1 (the twelfth centre) above the palate, then the fluctuations\nof pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a are stopped. When the eye of consciousness ( _viz_., the spiritual or\nthird eye) becomes calm and clear so as to be able to distinctly see in the\ntransparent \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b at a distance of twelve digits from the tip of his nose, then\nthe fluctuations of pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a are stopped. When the thoughts arising in the mind\nare bound up in the calm contemplation of the world of \xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81raka (star or eye)\nbetween one\'s eyebrows and are (thus) destroyed, then the fluctuations cease.\nWhen the [knowledge](errata.htm#12) which is of the form of the knowable,\n\np. 185\n\nwhich is beneficent and which is untouched by any modifications arises in one\nand is known as OM only and no other, then the fluctuations of pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a cease. By\nthe contemplation for a long time of the \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b which is in the heart, and by\nthe contemplation of the mind free from v\xc4\x81s\xc4\x81n\xc4\x81s, then the fluctuations of\npr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a cease. By these methods and various others suggested by (one\'s) thought\nand by means of the contact of the many (spiritual) guides, the fluctuations\ncease.\n\n"Having by contraction opened the door of kun\xe1\xb8\x8dalin\xc4\xab, one should force open the\ndoor of moksha. Closing with her mouth the door through which one ought to go,\nthe ku\xe1\xb9\x87dalin\xc4\xab sleeps spiral in form and coiled up like a serpent. He who\ncauses this kun\xe1\xb8\x8dalin\xc4\xab to move--he is an emancipated person. If this kun\xe1\xb8\x8dalin\xc4\xab\nwere to sleep in the upper part of the neck of any yogin, it goes towards his\nemancipation. (If it were to sleep) in the lower part (of the body), it is for\nthe bondage of the ignorant. Leaving the two n\xc4\x81dis, Id\xc4\x81 and the other\n(Pi\xe1\xb9\x85gal\xc4\x81), it (pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a) should move in the Sushumn\xc4\x81. That is the supreme seat of\nVish\xe1\xb9\x87u. One should practise control of breath with the concentration of the\nmind. The mind should not be allowed by a clever man to rest on any other\nthing. One should not worship Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u during the day alone. One should not\nworship Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u during the night alone; but should always worship Him, and\nshould not worship Him merely during day and night. The wisdom-producing\nopening (near uvula) has five passages. O \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87dilya this is the khechar\xc4\xabmu\xe1\xb8\x8dr\xc4\x81;\npractise it. With one who sits in the khechar\xc4\xabmu\xe1\xb8\x8dr\xc4\x81, the v\xc4\x81yu which was\nflowing before through the left and right n\xc4\x81dis now flows through the middle\none (Sushumn\xc4\x81). There is no doubt about it. You should swallow the air through\nthe void (Sushumn\xc4\x81) between Id\xc4\x81 and Pi\xe1\xb9\x85gal\xc4\x81. In that place is khechar\xc4\xabmu\xe1\xb8\x8dr\xc4\x81\nsituated, and that is the seat of Truth. Again that is khechar\xc4\xabmu\xe1\xb8\x8dr\xc4\x81 which is\nsituated in the \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9ba-chakra (in the head) in the nir\xc4\x81lamba (supportless) seat\nbetween the sun and moon ( _viz_., Id\xc4\x81 and Pi\xe1\xb9\x85gal\xc4\x81). When the tongue has been\nlengthened to the length of a kal\xc4\x81 (digit) by the incision (of the fraenum\nlingum) and by rubbing and milking it ( _viz_., the tongue), fix the gaze\nbetween the two eyebrows and close the hole in the skull with\n\np. 186\n\nthe tongue reversed. This is khechar\xc4\xabmu\xe1\xb8\x8dr\xc4\x81. When the tongue and the chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada\n(mind) both move in the \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b (khechar\xc4\xab), then the person with his tongue\nraised up becomes immortal. Firmly pressing the yoni (perineum) by the left\nheel, stretching out the right leg, grasping the feet with both hands and\ninhaling the air through the nostrils, practise ka\xe1\xb9\x87tha-ban\xe1\xb8\x8dha, 1 retaining the\nair upwards. By that, all afflictions are destroyed; then poison is digested\nas if it were nectar. Asthma, splenetic disease, the turning up of the anus\nand the numbness of the skin are removed. This is the means of conquering\npr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a and destroying death. Pressing the yoni by the left heel, place the\nother foot over the left thigh: inhale the air, rest the chin on the chest,\ncontract the yoni and contemplate, (as far as possible), your \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 as situated\nwithin your mind. Thus is the direct perception (of truth) attained.\n\n"Inhaling the pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a from outside and filling the stomach with it, centre the\npr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a with the mind in the middle of the navel, at the tip of the nose and at\nthe toes during the san\xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81s (sunset and sunrise) or at all times. (Thus) the\nyogin is freed from all diseases and fatigue. By centring his pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a at the tip\nof his nose, he obtains mastery over the element of air; by centring it at the\nmiddle of his navel, all diseases are destroyed; by centring it at the toes,\nhis body becomes light. He who drinks the air (drawn) through the tongue\ndestroys fatigue, thirst and diseases. He who drinks the air with his mouth\nduring the two san\xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81s and the last two hours of the night, within three\nmonths the auspicious Sarasva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab (goddess of speech) is present in his v\xc4\x81k\n(speech) _viz_., (he becomes eloquent and learned in his speech). In six\nmonths, he is free from all diseases. Drawing the air by the tongue, retain\nthe air at the root of the tongue. The wise man thus drinking nectar enjoys\nall prosperity. Fixing the \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 in the \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 itself in the middle of the\neyebrows, (having inhaled) through Id\xc4\x81 and breaking through that (centre)\nthirty times, even a sick man is freed from disease. He who draws the air\nthrough the n\xc4\x81dis and retains it for twenty-four minutes in the navel and in\n\np. 187\n\nthe sides of the stomach becomes freed from disease. He who for the space of a\nmonth during the three san\xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81s (sunset, sunrise, and midnight or noon) draws\nthe air through the tongue, pierces thirty times and retains his breath in the\nmiddle of his navel, becomes freed from all fevers and poisons. He who retains\nthe pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a together with the mind at the tip of his nose even for the space of\na muh\xc5\xabr\xe1\xb9\xada (forty-eight minutes), destroys all sins that were committed by him\nduring one hundred births.\n\n"Through the samyama of \xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81ra (Om), he knows all things. By retaining the mind\nat the tip of his nose, he acquires a knowledge of In\xe1\xb8\x8dra-world; 1 below that,\nhe acquires a knowledge of Agni-(fire) world. 1 Through the samyama of chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada\nin the eye, he gets a knowledge of all worlds: in the ear, a knowledge of\nYama-(the god of death) world: 1 in the sides of the ear, a knowledge of\nN\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadi-world: 1 in the back of it (the ear), a knowledge of Varu\xe1\xb9\x87a-world: 1 in\nthe left ear, a knowledge of V\xc4\x81yu-world: 1 in the throat, a knowledge of\nSoma-(moon) world: 1 in the left eye, a knowledge of \xc5\x9aiva-world: 1 in the\nhead, a knowledge of Brahm\xc4\x81-world: 1 in the soles of the feet, a knowledge of\nA\xe1\xb9\xadala world: 2 in the feet, a knowledge of Vi\xe1\xb9\xadala world: in the ankles, a\nknowledge of Ni\xe1\xb9\xadala (rather Su\xe1\xb9\xadala) world: in the calves, a knowledge of\nSu\xe1\xb9\xadala (rather \xe1\xb9\xacal\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81la world): in the knees, a knowledge of Mah\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadala world:\nin the thighs, a knowledge of Ras\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadala world: in the loins, a knowledge of\n\xe1\xb9\xacal\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadala (rather P\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81la) world: in the navel, a knowledge of Bh\xc5\xabrloka (earth-\nworld): in the stomach, a knowledge of Bhuvar (world): in the heart, a\nknowledge of Suvar (world): in the place above the heart, a knowledge of Mahar\nworld: in the throat, a knowledge of Jana world: in the middle of the brows, a\nknowledge of \xe1\xb9\xacapa world: in the head, a knowledge of Sa\xe1\xb9\xadya world.\n\n"By conquering \xe1\xb8\x8dharma and a\xe1\xb8\x8dharma, one knows the past and the future. By\ncentring it on the sound of every creature, a knowledge of the cry (or\nlanguage) of the\n\np. 188\n\nanimal is produced. By centring it on the sa\xc3\xb1chi\xe1\xb9\xada-karma (past karma yet to be\nenjoyed), a knowledge of one\'s previous births arises in him. By centring it\non the mind of another, a knowledge of the mind (or thoughts) of others is\ninduced. By centring it on the k\xc4\x81ya-r\xc5\xabpa (or form of the body), other forms\nare seen. By fixing it on the bala (strength), the strength of persons like\nHan\xc5\xabm\xc4\x81n is obtained. By fixing it on the sun, a knowledge of the worlds\narises. By fixing it on the moon, a knowledge of the constellation is\nproduced. By fixing it on the \xe1\xb8\x8chruva (Polar star) a perception of its motion\nis induced. By fixing it on his own (Self), one acquires the knowledge of\nPurusha; on the navel, he attains a knowledge of the k\xc4\x81ya-vy\xc5\xabha (mystical\narrangement of all the particles of the body so as to enable a person to wear\nout his whole karma in one life): on the well of the throat, freedom from\nhunger and thirst arises: on the K\xc5\xabrma n\xc4\x81di (which is situated in the well of\nthe throat), a firmness (of concentration) takes place. By fixing it on the\nt\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81 (pupil of the eye), he obtains the sight of the si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhas (spiritual\npersonages). By conquering the \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b in the body, he is able to soar in the\n\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b: (in short) by centring the mind in any place, he conquers the si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhis\nappertaining to that place.\n\n"Then comes pra\xe1\xb9\xady\xc4\x81h\xc4\x81ra, which is of five kinds. It is the drawing away of the\norgans from attaching themselves to the objects of senses. Contemplating upon\neverything that one sees as \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 is pra\xe1\xb9\xady\xc4\x81h\xc4\x81ra. Renouncing the fruits of one\'s\ndaily actions is pra\xe1\xb9\xady\xc4\x81h\xc4\x81ra. Turning away from all objects of sense is\npra\xe1\xb9\xady\xc4\x81h\xc4\x81ra. \xe1\xb8\x8ch\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81 in the eighteen important places (mentioned below) is\npra\xe1\xb9\xady\xc4\x81h\xc4\x81ra, ( _viz_.,) the feet, the toes, the ankles, the calves, the knees,\nthe thighs, the anus, the penis, the navel, the heart, the well of the throat,\nthe palate, the nose, the eyes, the middle of the brows, the forehead, and the\nhead in ascending and descending orders.\n\n"Then (comes) \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81.

Teach me\nthe science of Brahman by which I shall obtain that which is most excellent."\n\nA\xe1\xb9\xadharvan replied: "O \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87dilya, Brahman is sa\xe1\xb9\xadya, vij\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na and anan\xe1\xb9\xada in which\nall this (world) is interwoven, warp-wise and woof-wise, from which all\noriginated and into which all are absorbed, and which being known makes\neverything else known. It is without hands and feet, without eyes and ears,\nwithout tongue or without body, and is unreachable and undefinable. From\nwhich, v\xc4\x81k (speech) and mind return, being unable to obtain (or reach) It. It\nis to be cognised by j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na and yoga. 1 From which, praj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81 of old sprang. That\nwhich is one and non-dual, that which pervades everything like \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, which is\nextremely subtle, without a blemish, actionless, sa\xe1\xb9\xad (be-ness) only, the\nessence of the bliss of consciousness, beneficent, calm and immortal and which\nis beyond. That is Brahman. Thou art That. Know That by wisdom. He who is the\none, the shining, the giver of the power of \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, the omniscient, the lord of\nall, and the inner soul of all beings, who lives in all beings, who is hidden\nin all beings and the source of all beings, who is reachable only through yoga\nand who creates, supports and destroys everything--He is \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81.

Do not grieve, O knower of \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, thou shalt reach\nthe end of pains."\n\np. 190\n\n##### Chapter III\n\nThen \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87dilya questioned A\xe1\xb9\xadharvan thus: "From the Brahman that is Om,\nimperishable, actionless, beneficial, sa\xe1\xb9\xad (be-ness) only and supreme, how did\nthis universe arise? How does it exist in It? And how is it absorbed in It?\nPlease solve me this doubt."\n\nA\xe1\xb9\xadharvan replied: The Supreme Brahman, the Truth, is the imperishable and the\nactionless. Then from the formless Brahman, three forms (or aspects) arose, (\n_viz_.,) nishkal\xc4\x81 (partless,) sakal\xc4\x81 (with parts), and sakal\xc4\x81-nishkal\xc4\x81 (with\nand without parts). That which is sa\xe1\xb9\xadya, vij\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na and \xc4\x81nan\xe1\xb8\x8da, That which is\nactionless, without any impurity, omnipresent, extremely subtle, having faces\nin every direction, undefinable and immortal--that is His nishkal\xc4\x81 aspect.\nMahe\xc5\x9bvara (the great Lord) who is black and yellow rules, with avi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81,\nm\xc5\xablaprak\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadi or m\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81 that is red, white, and black, and that is co-existent\nwith Him. This is his sakal\xc4\x81-nishkal\xc4\x81 aspect. Then the Lord desired (or\nwilled) by his spiritual wisdom (thus): May I become many?; may I bring forth?\nThen from this Person who was contemplating and whose desires are fulfilled,\nthree letters sprang up. Three vy\xc4\x81h\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadis, 1 the three-footed G\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\xab, 1 the\nthree Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das, the three \xe1\xb8\x8devas, the three var\xe1\xb9\x87as (colours or castes) and the\nthree fires sprang. That Supreme Lord who is endowed with all kinds of wealth,\nwho is all pervading, who is situated in the hearts of all beings, who is the\nLord of m\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81 and whose form is m\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81--He is Brahma. He is Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u: He is Ru\xe1\xb8\x8dra:\nHe is In\xe1\xb8\x8dra: He is all the \xe1\xb8\x8devas: He is all the bh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xadas (elements or beings):\nHe only is before: He only is behind: He only is on our left: He only is on\nour right: He only is below: He only is above: He only is the all. That form\nof him as \xe1\xb8\x8ca\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadreya, 2 who sports with his \xc5\x9aak\xe1\xb9\xadi, who is kind to his\ndevotees, who is brilliant as fire, resembling the petals or a red lotus and\nis of four hands, who is mild and shines sinlessly--this is His sakal\xc4\x81 form."\n\np. 191\n\nThen \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87dilya questioned A\xe1\xb9\xadharvan, "O Lord, that which is Sa\xe1\xb9\xad only and the\nessence of the bliss of consciousness--why is He called Parabrahman?"\n\nA\xe1\xb9\xadharvan replied: "Because He increases _b \xe1\xb9\x9bha\xe1\xb9\xadi_ and causes to increase\neverything ( _b \xe1\xb9\x9bhan\xe1\xb9\xadi_); so he is called Parabrahman. Why is He called \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81?\nSince He obtains ( _\xc4\x81 pno\xe1\xb9\xadi_) everything, since He takes back everything and\nsince He is everything, so he is called \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. Why is He called Mahe\xc5\x9bvara (the\ngreat Lord)? Since by the sound of the words Maha\xe1\xb9\xad-\xc4\xaa\xc5\x9ba (the great Lord) and by\nHis own power, the great Lord governs everything. Why is He called \xe1\xb8\x8ca\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadreya?\nBecause the Lord being extremely pleased with A\xe1\xb9\xadri (\xe1\xb9\x9ashi) who was performing a\nmost difficult penance and who had expressed his desire to see Him who is\nlight itself, offered Himself (\xe1\xb8\x8da\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada) as their son, and because the woman\nAnas\xc5\xaby\xc4\x81 was his mother and A\xe1\xb9\xadri was his father. Therefore he who knows the\n(secret) meaning knows everything. He who always contemplates on the supreme\nthat It is himself becomes a knower of Brahman. Here these \xc5\x9blokas (stanzas)\noccur (to memory). \'He who contemplates always the Lord of Lords and the\nancient thus--as \xe1\xb8\x8ca\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadreya, the beneficent, the calm, of the colour of\nsapphire, one who delights in his own m\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81 and the Lord who has shaken off\neverything, as naked and as one whose whole body is besmeared with the holy\nashes, who has matted hair, who is the Lord of all, who has four arms, who is\nbliss in appearance, whose eyes are like full-blown lotus, who is the store of\nj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na and yoga, who is the spiritual instructor of all the worlds and who is\ndear to all the yogins, and one who is merciful towards His devotees, who is\nthe witness of all and who is worshipped by all the si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhas is freed from all\nsins and will attain (the Spirit).\'\n\n"Om Sa\xe1\xb9\xadyam (truth).
