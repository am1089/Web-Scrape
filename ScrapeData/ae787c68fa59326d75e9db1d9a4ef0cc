Verily 2 the dawn is the head of the horse which is fit for sacrifice, the\nsun its eye, the wind its breath, the mouth the Vai _s_ vanara 3 fire, the\nyear the body of the sacrificial horse. Heaven is the back, the sky the belly,\nthe earth the chest 4, the quarters the two sides, the intermediate quarters\nthe ribs, the members the seasons, the joints the months and half-months, the\nfeet days and nights, the bones the stars, the\n\np. 74\n\nflesh the clouds. The half-digested food is the sand, the rivers the bowels 1,\nthe liver and the lungs 2 the mountains, the hairs the herbs and trees. As the\nsun rises, it is the forepart, as it sets, the hindpart of the horse. When the\nhorse shakes itself 3, then it lightens; when it kicks, it thunders; when it\nmakes water, it rains; voice 4 is its voice.\n\n2\\. Verily Day arose after the horse as the (golden) vessel 5, called Mahiman\n(greatness), which (at the sacrifice) is placed before the horse. Its place is\nin the Eastern sea. The Night arose after the horse as the (silver) vessel,\ncalled Mahiman, which (at the sacrifice) is placed behind the horse. Its place\nis in the Western sea. Verily, these two vessels (or greatnesses) arose to be\non each side of the horse.\n\nAs a racer he carried the Devas, as a stallion the Gandharvas, as a runner the\nAsuras, as a horse men. The sea is its kin, the sea is its birthplace.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[73:1](sbe15053.htm#fr_246) It is the third Adhyaya of the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka, but\nthe first of the Upanishad.\n\n[73:2](sbe15053.htm#fr_247) This Brahma _n_ a is found in the Madhyandina text\nof the _S_ atapatha, ed. Weber, X, 6, 4. Its object is there explained by the\ncommentary to be the meditative worship of Vira _g_ , as represented\nmetaphorically in the members of the horse. Saya _n_ a dispenses with its\nexplanation, because, as part of the B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka-upanishad,\naccording to the Ka _n_ va- _s_ akha, it had been enlarged on by the\nVarttikakara and explained.\n\n[73:3](sbe15053.htm#fr_248) Agni or fire, as pervading everything, as\nuniversally present in nature.\n\n[73:4](sbe15053.htm#fr_249) Pa _g_ asya is doubtful. The commentator suggests\npad-asya, the place of the feet, i.e. the hoof The Greek P\xc4\x93gasos, or \xe1\xbc\xb5\xcf\x80\xcf\x80\xce\xbf\xce\xb9\n\xcf\x80\xce\xb7\xce\xbb\xce\xbf\xce\xaf, throws no light on the word. The meaning of hoof would hardly be\nappropriate here, and I prefer chest on account of uras in I, 2, 3. Deussen\n(Vedanta, p. 8) translates, die Erde seiner Fusse Schemel; but we want some\npart of the horse.\n\n[74:1](sbe15053.htm#fr_250) Guda, being in the plural, is explained by na _d_\ni, channel, and sira _h_ ; for we ought to read sira or hiragraha _n_ e for\n_s_ ira, p. 22, l. 16.\n\n[74:2](sbe15053.htm#fr_251) Klomana _h_ is explained as a plurale tantum\n(nityam bahuva _k_ anam ekasmin), and being described as a lump below the\nheart, on the opposite side of the liver, it is supposed to be the lungs.\n\n[74:3](sbe15053.htm#fr_252) 'When it yawns.' \xc3\x82nandagiri.\n\n[74:4](sbe15053.htm#fr_253) Voice is sometimes used as a personified power of\nthunder and other aerial sounds, and this is identified with the voice of the\nhorse.\n\n[74:5](sbe15053.htm#fr_254) Two vessels, to hold the sacrificial libations,\nare placed at the A _s_ vamedha before and behind the horse, the former made\nof gold, the latter made of silver. They are called Mahiman in the technical\nlanguage of the ceremonial. The place in which these vessels are set, is\ncalled their yoni. Cf. Vagas.
