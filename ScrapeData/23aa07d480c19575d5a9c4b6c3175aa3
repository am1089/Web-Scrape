On account of the appropriateness of the manifestation of that\n(connexion) which exists (potentially); like virile power.\n\nAs in ordinary life virile power and so on, existing potentially only in young\nchildren, and being then looked upon as non-existing, become manifest at the\ntime of puberty--and do not originate at that time from previous non-\nexistence, because in that case they might originate in eunuchs also--; so the\nconnexion of the soul with the\n\np. 48\n\nbuddhi exists potentially merely during deep sleep and the period of general\nretractation, and again becomes manifest at the time of waking and the time of\ncreation.--This explanation is appropriate, because nothing can be assumed to\nspring up unless from something else; otherwise we should have to suppose that\neffects spring up without causes. That the rising from deep sleep is due to\nthe existence of potential avidya, scripture also declares, 'Having become\nmerged in the True they know not that they are merged in the True. Whatever\nthese creatures are here, whether a lion or a wolf,' &c. ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 9, 2;\n3).--It is therefore a proved matter that the connexion of the soul with the\nbuddhi and the other adjuncts lasts as long as the soul (in its sa _m_ sara-\nstate).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 32](sbe38033.htm)\n\n"
