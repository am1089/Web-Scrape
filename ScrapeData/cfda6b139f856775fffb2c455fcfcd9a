Vyasa said :-- The very powerful Asura Mahi _s_ a, puffed up with vanity\non his getting the boon, obtained sovereignty and brought the whole world\nunder his control! He, being the paramount power, began to protect the sea-\ngirt earth acquired by the power of his own arms, over which he had the sole\nsovereignty, there being no other rival king nor any cause of the slightest\nfear. His Commander-in-Chief was then the very powerful Chik _s_ ura, maddened\nwith pride; and Tamra was in charge of the Royal Treasury, guarded by many\nsoldiers. There were, then, many generals Asiloma, Vi _d_ ala, Udarka,\nVaskala, Trinetra, Kala, Bandhaka and others, very proud, and each in charge\nof his own corps respectively and occupying this sea-girt earth. O king! The\npowerful kings that reigned before were made subservient and tributary; and\nthose, that fought valiantly befitting the K _s_ attriya line, were slain by\nMahi _s_ a. The Brahma _n_ as over the earth became subservient to Mahi _s_ a\nand gave their Yaj\xc3\xb1a offerings to him. When that Mahi _s_ asura got the sole\nsovereign sway of this world, he, proud of his boons, desired to conquer the\nHeavens. Then Mahi _s_ a, the Lord of the Daityas, desirous to send an envoy\nto Indra, the Lord of S'achi, instantly called for the messenger and spoke to\nhim thus :-- Go, O hero! O valiant one! to Heaven. Act as my messenger and\ntell Indra fearlessly thus :-- \xc2\x93O thousand-eyed one! Quit the Heavens; go\nanywhere you like, or offer your service to the high-souled Mahi _s_ a! He is\nthe lord; and if you take refuge unto him, he will certainly protect you.\nTherefore, O Lord of S'achi, better seek the protection of Mahi _s_ a. If, O\nBalasudana! Not willing, wield your Vajra at once; we know your powers; you\nwere, in days of yore, conquered by our ancestors. O chief of the Suras! You\nare the paramour of Ahalya; your strength is well known, give battle or go\nanywhere you like.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n15-21. Vyasa said :-- Hearing the messenger's words, Indra became very\nindignant and laughed and said :-- I did not know, O you stupid, that you were\nmaddened with vanity; I will shortly give medicines for your master's disease.\nNow I will extirpate him by the roots; wise persons do not slay messengers; I\ntherefore let you go. Better go and tell him what I say :-- \xc2\x93Son of a buffalo!\nIf you are willing to fight, better come and do not delay. O Enemy of horse!\n(Buffaloes and horses are always at war with each other) Your strength is well\nknown to me; you are a grass eater and your appearance is stupid, idiotic; out\nof your horns I will make a good bow. You depend on your horns for your\nstrength;\n\n\n\np. 361\n\n\n\nthat I well know. You are clever in striking with your horns; you don't know\nanything about warfare; therefore I will out off your both the weapons and\nrender you powerless. You are very much puffed up with vanity due to that.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n22\\. Vyasa said :-- Indra having spoken thus, the messenger quickly returned\nto his haughty master Mahi _s_ a and saluting, spoke :--\n\n\n\n23-28. The messenger said :-- Indra counts you not even a fig, as he is\nsurrounded by his Deva forces and considers himself quite sufficient. It ought\none's servant to speak true and pleasant before one's master; how can I utter\nthe words before my master, that are spoken by that brute Indra. Whereas the\nwell known maxim reigns in my mind withal that I am your well-wishing servant\nand I ought to speak truth before you, my master, and that truth is to be\npleasant to hear also. If pleasant words I speak only, then I fail in my duty;\nat the same time, harsh words ought not to be spoken by me, your sincere well-\nwisher. My Lord! The cruel poison-like words that come from the mouth of an\nenemy, how can I, a servant of yours, utter those harsh sayings! O Lord of the\nEarth! I will never be able to utter those rude sayings that Indra has spoken.\n\n\n\n29-53. Vyasa said :-- Hearing the messenger's words full of meaning the grass-\neater Mahi _s_ a Danava got very angry and, waggling his tail behind his back,\npassed urine; then his eyes reddened with anger, he called the Danavas before\nhim and said :--O Danavas! The Lord of the Devas is firmly resolved on battle;\ntherefore collect your forces; we will have to conquer that devil, the chief\nof the Suras. Who can stand for him a my rival here! If hundreds and thousands\nof warriors like Indra come I do not fear any of them at all; O Danavas, we\nwill thoroughly put a end to him. His heroism is before those only that are\npeaceful and quiet before the ascetics that have become lean and thin by the\npenances; he is licentious and can only seduce other's wives by craftiness and\narts. He is a thorough rogue and hypocrite, vicious and faultfinding;\notherwise why does he put obstacles before others, depending for his strength\nonly on the beauties of the Apsaras or heavenly prostitutes. He is treacherous\nto his very core; therefore he, being afraid at the very outset, took oaths,\nand entered into agreement with the high-souled Namuchi; afterwards, when his\ntime turned favourable, that villain broke his treaty and treacherously killed\nhim. Again the powerful Vi _sn_ u is a thorough master of treachery and\nhypocrisy, the mine in taking oaths and can only show his vanity and is expert\nin that. He can assume many forms at will by his Magic power. For these very\nreasons Vi _sn_ u had to take the form of a boar and\n\n\n\np. 362\n\n\n\nkill Hira _n_ yak _s_ a; and again he had to take up a man-lion form to kill\nHira _n_ ya Kas'ipu. O Danavas! Never shall I surrender myself to Vi _sn_ u,\nfor I never place my trust in the words or deeds of Vi _sn_ u and his Devas.\nWhat can Indra or Vi _sn_ u do against me, when the most powerful Rudra is not\nable to fight against me in the battle-field! I will instantly defeat Indra,\nVaru _n_ a, Yama, Kuvera, Fire, Sun and Moon and get possession of their\nHeavens. On our conquering the Devas, we all shall get our share of Yaj\xc3\xb1as and\nwe along with other Danavas drink the Soma juice and enjoy ourselves in\nHeaven. O Danavas! I have got the boon; what do I now care for the Devas. My\ndeath is not from men too. What can a woman do to me? O my emissaries! Call\nwithout any delay the chief Danavas from the nether regions and the mountains\nand make them my generals? O Danavas! I can alone conquer all the Devas; only\nto make the war arrangements look nice, that I am taking you to defeat them.\nThere is no fear of mine from the Devas, consequent on the boon conferred on\nme. I will kill them by my hoofs and horns. I am not to be killed by Suras,\nAsuras, as men; therefore get yourselves ready to conquer the Devas. O\nDanavas! After conquering the Heavens we will be garlanded with Parijata\nwreaths and we will enjoy the Deva women in the Nandana Garden. We will drink\nthe milk of the heavenly milching cow (the cow that yields all desires) and,\nintoxicated with the heavenly drinks, we will hear and see the music and\nsinging the dancing of the Gandarbhas there. You will all be served there with\nvarious bottles of wine by Urvasi, Menaka, Rambha, Ghritachi, Tillottama,\nPramadvara Mahasena, Mira Kesi, Madotkata, Viprachitti and others. Then be all\nready at once for this auspicious occasion to march to Heavens and fight there\nwith the Suras. And be pleased to call that pure-souled Muni S'ukracharya, the\nson of Bhrigu and the Guru of the Daityas and worship him and tell him to\nperform sacrificial ceremonies for the safety and victory of the Danavas. O\nking! Thus, ordering the chief Danavas, the wicked Mahi _s_ a went to his\nabode, with gladness.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Third Chapter of the Fifth Book on the Daitya armies getting\nready in S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, the Mahapura _n_ am by Mahar _s_ i\nVedavyasa of 18,000 verses.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 1](bk05ch04.htm)\n\n"
