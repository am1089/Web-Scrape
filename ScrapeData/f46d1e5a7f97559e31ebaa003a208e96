Now (follows) the strewing (of grass) around (the fire).\n\n2\\. He strews eastward-pointed Ku _s_ a grass around it, in three layers or in\nfive layers,\n\n3\\. Beginning on the east side, then to the west, then to the west.\n\n4\\. He covers the roots (of the grass-blades) with the points.\n\n5\\. And all kinds of rites are to be performed beginning south, ending north.\n\n6 6. He places the Brahman south with the words, BH\xc3\x9bR BHUVA _H_ SVA _H_ ,\n\n7\\. Adorns him with flowers,\n\n8 8. Carries forward on the north side the Pra _n_ ita waters with the words,\n'Who carries ye forward?'\xc2\x97\n\n9 9. Takes up with the left hand the Ku _s_ a blades, and arranges them (on\nthe ground) with the right hand,\n\np. 25\n\n10\\. Bending his right knee,\n\n11\\. The left when worshipping the Manes.\n\n12\\. The strewing around (of the grass) is not necessary in the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya\nofferings,\n\n13 13. Nor in the standing offerings, according to Ma _n_ _d_ ukeya.\n\n14 14-16. He now measures off with the span (of his hand) two Ku _s_ a blades,\nwhich are not unequal, with unbroken points, bearing no young shoots in them,\nand severs them (from their roots) with a Ku _s_ a blade, saying, 'Purifiers\nare ye.'\n\n15\\. There are two or three (of these Ku _s_ a strainers).\n\n16\\. He holds them with their points to the east and sprinkles them (with\nwater, saying), 'Belonging to Vish _n_ u.'\n\n17\\. With the two Ku _s_ a blades he sprinkles (water) around the fire three\ntimes, keeping his right side turned towards it,\n\n18 18. Takes up the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya pot with the words, 'Milk of the cows art thou;'\n\n19 19. Puts it on the fire with the words, 'For sap thee;'\n\n20 20. Takes it from the fire towards the north with the words, 'For juice\nthee;'\n\n21 21. And holding the two (Ku _s_ a) strainers with their points to the\nnorth, seizing them on both sides\n\np. 26\n\nwith his two thumbs and fourth fingers, he bends them down, the points\nupwards, and dips them into the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya with the words,\n\n'By the impulse of Savitar I purify thee with this uninjured purifier, with\nthe rays of the good sun.'\n\n22\\. (This) preparation of the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya (takes place) each time.\n\n23\\. Let him not offer (\xc3\x82 _g_ ya) which has not been (thus) prepared.\n\n24 24-25. Also the waters in the Sruva spoon (he purifies) with the words,\n'(By the impulse) of Savitar (I purify) you.'\n\n25\\. This (is called) the PRA _N_ \xc3\x8eT\xc3\x82 and the PROKSHA _N_ \xc3\x8e water.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[24:1](sbe29010.htm#fr_43) 8, 1.

Comp. Naraya _n_ a's note on\nSutra 1 (p. 123 of the German edition). That this is indeed the order of the\ndifferent acts is confirmed by Paraskara I, 1, 2.\n\n[25:13](sbe29010.htm#fr_47) 'In the standing offerings, such as the Vai _s_\nvadeva sacrifice in the morning and in the evening.'
