If thou look upon the might of this Siva even for a moment,\nthy sins shall pass away.\n\n305\n\nA woman dwells on the head of Siva and ever dues a woman dwell in the mouth of\nBrahma.

Wealth and kin are the\nencircling wall and fools are the prisoners.\n\n310\n\np. 83\n\nUnable to swim the stream of abstinence that lies across their path, the three\ngods are subdued with the hook (rope) in their noses by the bonds of marriage.\nIs not it then a joke for a man to say he will swim it?\n\n311\n\nIf a creature kill a creature and give it to a creature, thus devoured, shall\nbeatitude be attained by the slayers of animals?\n\n312\n\nDid not Rama cast the fire-dart, and dry up the sea, pass over, and return and\nstand still. Then did he not bring trees and hills and with them build the\nbridge?\n\n313\n\nWhatever thou may, thy life is not in thy possessions. Though thou possess\nnothing thou possessest life. The destiny written by Brahma in thy forehead is\nvile as the writing of a slut.\n\n314\n\nBy not bestowing food on one who begged it off him in the former birth, he\nbecomes necessitous in the iron age.

Thy\nmind (buddhi) and thy acts being combined and untwined what can such men say\nto this? They must endure the fruits of their sins.\n\n318\n\nBe he a great sinner or a Brahmin slayer or merciless or base, when he dies\nif, he stay all his desires and meditate on Siva, he shall become ( _muct_ )\nhappy.\n\np. 85\n\n319\n\nWhy shouldst thou muse on thy acts done in a former birth? They have become\nthe life of thy present existence. If thou consider the acts, thy present life\nshall take effect hereafter. What understanding is that which cannot know\nthis?\n\n320\n\nUrine turns into excellence. Birth is sure by its means. Being born it turns\nto gold and a man of excellence. All those unchangeable souls that believe in\nthee, thou shall make acceptable as the blessed above O Vemana.\n\n321\n\nThe woman that cannot give meat or drink is deceitful. If then in a succeeding\nbirth, if she wish for food shall she gain it? This is like longing for a\nvest?\n\n322\n\nThey who in time of need sell for an inferior price; these are the men who in\nsuch circumstances hang even in diminished price. Why should they who accept\nit consent? Besides should they ever have agreed, still the act is not\nbefitting (I doubt the meaning of this intricate stupidity).\n\np. 86\n\n323\n\nIf thou bound a _linga_ on a _bhavi_ and burn something that is _bhavi_ and\nwear its ashes, shall one who is _bhavi_ be unable to see Siva, because ye\nchoose to exclude him.\n\n324\n\nIf thou bestow the exalted _vaishnava_ sect on one of debased caste and call\nhim superior to Brahmins, this is like cleaning a toddy pot and filling it\nwith the water of Ganges at Benares.\n\n325\n\nHe who unasked bestows his property--this is the Brahmin Saint. He who gives\nonly when asked is a mere giver But he who is poor as to beg again of him who\nhas solicited his aid, is the Siva Saint.\n\n326\n\nWhat did Parasurama gain by slaying his mother at his father's advice? Was he\nnot deprived of all shadows of refuge to stand by him and driven to\n_malayadri_?\n\n327\n\np. 87\n\nThere are abundance of those who recite the ( _tantra_ ) treatises on\nreligion. But there are none who mention the mantras. They have become\npowerless as the puppets of a show man.\n\n328\n\nAre not all those who revile Siva ashamed when they view the form _Dacshu_ ,\nthe ram faced, and after seeing the precious dignity of adultery who would\ncommit adultery?\n\n329\n\nWhat is the cause that being born in water and grown in water; he puts water\naway from him and uniting himself with women, he relies on this fleeting body.\n\n330\n\nThe accomplished maid drinks palmwine and water and among the great she looses\nher petticoat and dances. When she has done her work, she puts on her rags\nagain.\n\n331\n\nHe that eats dogs (quells his passions) is the ( _linga_ ) Janga Teacher. He\nthat eats hog (quells his bodily lusts) is the Parama _yogee_. He that eats\nthe elephant, how wise [must](errata.htm#51) he be!\n\np. 88\n\n332\n\nOn the fourth day of he moon's decrease, a girl brought forth. On the fifth\nday she dressed herself and seeing her vest as a screen she gave the breast to\nnet babe (a mystic riddle not worth explaining).\n\n333\n\nIn an [alligator's](errata.htm#52) eye an old woman brought forth; the chiefs\nof beings have not put away her uncleanness; if those beings come how shalt\nthey put it away?\n\n334\n\nIn a girl's hand is a bunch of desirable flowers. In that bunch four spouts\n(distillations); consider in them the soul resides.\n\n335\n\nAt high noon ( _mudras_ ) by the heat of the [full moon](errata.htm#53)\n(jyotees), the large bee (wisdom) rapidly fans the breeze (grow). By full\nfaith the soul enters into thee.\n\n336\n\nHe that knows his mother knows the deity. He that knows the earth knows\nheaven. He that knows heaven and earth vows himself.\n\np. 89\n\n337\n\nThere was a pleasing girl on a loft (story). The girl speaking--I conceived an\nintention. In that intention consider thou shalt see beatitude.\n\n338\n\nA tree grew on a bird. In that tree were thirteen seeds. Listen there is a\ntree in those seeds.\n\n339\n\nWith a gurgling sound he swallowed down a woman. When he swallowed her the\nwoman stared. He swallowed her down body and all. (Woman is delusion).\n\n340\n\nA woman adorned with (wearing) beauty. To wear them, plucks (roots) them out\nof the box; when she tries to do so, a chief widow arrested her.\n\n341\n\nThe jewel of woman went to buy oil, bought and brought home the cut-oil. Can\noil ever be cut? (worthless)\n\np. 90\n\n342\n\nFirst there were three branches born in a tree. Spouts, boughs and leaves were\n[therein](errata.htm#54) produced. The flower, the bud (foot spout) and the\nfull fruit fill the world.\n\n343\n\nWith the widowed widow _maya_ \\--they plunge and emerge in\n[worldly](errata.htm#55) pursuits. But when that affection has ceased, when\nher protection ceases those desires themselves exist not.\n\n344\n\nBorn from thy mother, sucking thy mother's breast and playing roguish pranks\nwith thy mother, what shall I say of the reality (tatwa) of the mother being\nin another transmigration--the wife?\n\n345\n\nIf a masker openly and causelessly throw the hundred and first tribe into a\nwell, shall he being a mere toddy pilferer attain a future life?\n\n346\n\np. 91\n\nHe who can turn fire into water and water into fire, who converts fire into\nwind, and if he himself be fire, he is the jewel of _yogees_ (i.e., if by\nmortification he can purify himself from the impurer elements).\n\n347\n\nIts feet are ten and three tails, one head--Thus it openly appears roaming the\nnoble earth ill at ease. He who can clearly understand this is _Ishwara_ (a\nmystic riddle, quite worthless).\n\n348\n\nHe lives well known to the people; but is not a king. He has a crown on him,\nbut he is not Brahma. He knows and speaks of what is fit, yet is no _yogee_.\nKnow who this is ([pure](errata.htm#56) fooling of _Para Brahma_ ).\n\n[349](errata.htm#57)\n\nIt produces young ones in the earth and writes their characters on them, and\nsuffer beheading.

Surely\nthe cuckoo [practices](errata.htm#58) penance on the bough.\n\n352\n\nHusband and son both (join) delight to touch and seize the wife's breasts.\nSuch is nature in the world.

If the\nhusband touches it, 'that place' moistens with desire O Vema!\n\n353\n\nA whore devoid of lewdness is the devil's daughter; joyless work a plague of\nrubbing. Thus a village [devoid](errata.htm#59) of a liberal man is demon's\ntown.\n\n354\n\nSay not, this one, she is not fresh and this one is fresh.

It is hurtful to meddle with a whore who\nhath a mother.\n\n356\n\nWithout coition a woman becomes old. If it enjoys coition, the jewel of horses\nbecomes decrepit. In the earth, the man becomes aged who with incessant desire\nindulges in excessive coition. This is true, O Vema.\n\n357\n\nIt is ruin to go with a gypsy's whore who can restrain a sinful mind. If she\nwill leave the village I begone elsewhere\n\n358\n\nA whore's elder sister will caress and kiss you. The paramour gazes at her\nthrough love of his whore. Those of the wife's side are all his relations.\n\n359\n\np. 94\n\nBorn in the _yoni_ , ye long for the _yoni_ ; you grow by sucking the breast\nand still seize the breast.

Can there be any greater assembly of\nmischievous charms? (a beautiful and easy song)\n\np. 95\n\n362\n\nHe who serves the semen becomes the seed. He who serveth the holy streams\nbecometh a God.

From the\njuice of the generatiyn, seed is formed. To discriminate between the juice and\nthe seed is essential.\n\n370\n\nThe forehead .of him whose fate is there written, is but small.
