At\nthe end of the last Adhyaya we read that _S_ veta _s_ vatara told it to the\nbest among the hermits, and that it should be kept secret, and not be taught\nto any one except to a son or a regular pupil. It is also called _S_ veta _s_\nva 1, though, it would seem, for the sake of the metre only. The _S_ veta _s_\nvataras are mentioned as a _S_ akha 2, subordinate to the _K_ arakas; but of\nthe literature belonging to them in particular, nothing is ever mentioned\nbeyond this Upanishad.\n\n_S_ veta _s_ vatara means a white mule, and as mules were known and prized in\nIndia from the earliest times, _S_ veta _s_ vatara, as the name of a person,\nis no more startling than _S_ veta _s_ va, white horse, an epithet of Ar _g_\nuna. Now as no one would be likely to conclude from the name of one of the\ncelebrated Vedic _Ri_ shis, _S_ yava _s_ va, i.e. black horse, that negro\ninfluences might be discovered in his hymns, it is hardly necessary to say\nthat all speculations as to Christian influences, or the teaching of white\nSyro-Christian missionaries, being indicated by the name of _S_ veta _s_\nvatara, are groundless 3.\n\nThe _S_ veta _s_ vatara-upanishad holds a very high rank among the Upanishads.\nThough we cannot say that it is quoted by name by Badarayana in the Vedanta-\nsutras,\n\np. xxxii\n\nit is distinctly referred to as sruta or revealed 1. It is one of the twelve\nUpanishads chosen by Vidyaranya in his Sarvopanishad-arthanabhutipraka _s_ a,\nand it was singled out by _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara as worthy of a special commentary.\n\nThe _S_ veta _s_ vatara-upanishad seems to me one of the most difficult, and\nat the same time one of the most interesting works of its kind. Whether on\nthat and on other grounds it should be assigned to a more ancient or to a more\nmodern period is what, in the present state of our knowledge, or, to be\nhonest, of our ignorance of minute chronology during the Vedic period, no true\nscholar would venture to assert. We must be satisfied to know that, as a\nclass, the Upanishads are presupposed by the Kalpa-sutras, that some of them,\ncalled Mantra-upanishads, form part of the more modern Sa _m_ hitas, and that\nthere are portions even in the Rig-veda-sa _m_ hita 2 for which the name of\nUpanishad is claimed by the Anukrama _n_ is. We find them most frequent,\nhowever, during the Brahma _n_ a-period, in the Brahma _n_ as themselves, and,\nmore especially, in those portions which are called \xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas, while a\nlarge number of them is referred to the Atharva-veda. That, in imitation of\nolder Upanishads, similar treatises were composed to a comparatively recent\ntime, has, of course, long been known 3.\n\nBut when we approach the question whether among the ancient and genuine\nUpanishads one may be older than the other, we find that, though we may guess\nmuch, we can prove nothing. The Upanishads belonged to Parishads or\nsettlements spread all over India. There is a stock of ideas, even of\nexpressions, common to most of them. Yet, the ideas collected in the\nUpanishads cannot all have grown tip in one and the same place, still less in\nregular succession. They must have had an independent growth, determined by\nindividual and local influences, and opinions which in one village might seem\nfar advanced, would in another be looked upon as behind the world. We may\n\np. xxxiii\n\nadmire the ingeniousness of those who sometimes in this, sometimes in that\npeculiarity see a clear indication of the modern date of an Upanishad, but to\na conscientious scholar such arguments are really distasteful for the very\nsake of their ingeniousness. He knows that they will convince many who do not\nknow the real difficulties; he knows they will have to be got out of the way\nwith no small trouble, and he knows that, even if they should prove true in\nthe end, they will require very different support from what they have hitherto\nreceived, before they can be admitted to the narrow circle of scientific\nfacts.\n\nWhile fully admitting therefore that the _S_ veta _s_ vatara-upanishad has its\npeculiar features and its peculiar difficulties, I must most strongly maintain\nthat no argument that has as yet been brought forward, seems to me to prove,\nin any sense of the word, its modern character.\n\nIt has been said, for instance, that the _S_ veta _s_ vatara-upanishad is a\nsectarian Upanishad, because, when speaking of the Highest Self or the Highest\nBrahman, it applies such names to him as Hara (I, 10), Rudra (II, 17; III, 2;\n4; IV, 12; 21; 22), _S_ iva (III, 14; IV, 10), Bhagavat (III, 14), Agni,\n\xc3\x82ditya, Vayu, &c. (IV, 2). But here it is simply taken for granted that the\nidea of the Highest Self was developed first, and, after it had reached its\nhighest purity, was lowered again by an identification with mythological and\npersonal deities. The questions whether the conception of the Highest Self was\nformed once and once only, whether it was formed after all the personal and\nmythological deities had first been merged into one Lord (Pra _g_ apati), or\nwhether it was discovered behind the veil of any other name in the\nmythological pantheon of the past, have never been mooted. Why should not an\nancient Rishi have said: What we have hitherto called Rudra, and what we\nworship as Agni, or _S_ iva, is in reality the Highest Self, thus leaving much\nof the ancient mythological phraseology to be used with a new meaning? Why\nshould we at once conclude that late sectarian worshippers of mythological\ngods replaced again the Highest Self, after their fathers had discovered it,\nby their own sectarian names? If we adopt the former\n\np. xxxiv\n\nview, the Upanishads, which still show these rudera of the ancient temples,\nwould have to be considered as more primitive even than those in which the\nidea of the Brahman or the Highest Self has reached its utmost purity.\n\nIt has been considered a very strong argument in support of the modern and\nsectarian character of the _S_ veta _s_ vatara-upanishad, that 'it inculcates\nwhat is called Bhakti 1, or implicit reliance on the favour of the deity\nworshipped.' Now it is quite true that this Upanishad possesses a very\ndistinct character of its own, by the stress which it lays on the personal,\nand sometimes almost mythical character of the Supreme Spirit; but, so far\nfrom inculcating bhakti, in the modern sense of the word, it never mentions\nthat word, except in the very last verse, a verse which, if necessary, certain\ncritics would soon dispose of as a palpable addition. But that verse says no\nmore than this: 'If these truths (of the Upanishad) have been told to a high-\nminded man, who feels the highest devotion for God, and for his Guru as for\nGod, then they will shine forth indeed.' Does that prove the existence of\nBhakti as we find it in the Sa _n_ _d_ ilya-sutras 2?\n\nAgain, it has been said that the _S_ veta _s_ vatara-upanishad is sectarian in\na philosophical sense, that it is in fact an Upanishad of the Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya system\nof philosophy, and not of the Vedanta. Now I am quite willing to admit that,\nin its origin, the Vedanta philosophy is nearer to the Vedic literature than\nany other of the six systems of philosophy, and that if we really found\ndoctrines, peculiar to the Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya, and opposed to the Vedanta, in the _S_\nveta _s_ vatara-upanishad, we might feel inclined to assign to our Upanishad a\nlater date. But where is the proof of this?\n\nNo doubt there are expressions in this Upanishad which remind us of technical\nterms used at a later time in the Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya system of philosophy, but of Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya\ndoctrines, which I had myself formerly suspected in this Upanishad,\n\np. xxxv\n\nI can on closer study find very little. I think it was Mr. Gough who, in his\nPhilosophy of the Upanishads, for the first time made it quite clear that the\nteaching of our Upanishad is, in the main, the same as that of the other\nUpanishads. 'The _S_ veta _s_ vatara-upanishad teaches,' as he says, 'the\nunity of souls in the one and only Self; the unreality of the world as a\nseries of figments of the self-feigning world-fiction; and as the first of the\nfictitious emanations, the existence of the Demiurgos or universal soul\npresent in every individual soul, the deity that projects the world out of\nhimself, that the migrating souls may find the recompense of their works in\nformer lives.'\n\nI do not quite agree with this view of the \xc3\x8e _s_ vara, whom Mr. Gough calls\nthe Demiurgos, but he seems to me perfectly right when he says that the _S_\nveta _s_ vatara-upanishad propounds in Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya terms the very principles that\nthe Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya philosophers make it their business to subvert. One might doubt as\nto the propriety of calling certain terms 'Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya terms' in a work written at\na time when a Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya philosophy, such as we know it as a system, had as yet\nno existence, and when the very name Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya meant something quite different\nfrom the Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya system of Kapila. Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya is derived from sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya, and that\nmeant counting, number, name, corresponding very nearly to the Greek \xce\xbb\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xb3\xce\xbf\xcf\x82.\nSa\xe1\xb9\x85khya, as derived from it, meant originally no more than theoretic\nphilosophy, as opposed to yoga, which meant originally practical religious\nexercises and penances, to restrain the passions and the senses in general.\nAll other interpretations of these words, when they had become technical\nnames, are of later date.\n\nBut even in their later forms, whatever we may think of the coincidences and\ndifferences between the Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya and Vedanta systems of philosophy, there is\none point on which they are diametrically opposed. Whatever else the Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya\nmay be, it is dualistic; whatever else the Vedanta may be, it is monistic. In\nthe Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya, nature, or whatever else we may call it, is independent of the\npurusha; in the Vedanta it is not. Now the _S_ veta _s_ vatara-upanishad\nstates distinctly that nature, or what in the Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya philosophy\n\np. xxxvi\n\nis intended by Pradhana, is not an independent power, but a power ( _s_ akti)\nforming the very self of the Deva. 'Sages,' we read, 'devoted to meditation\nand concentration, have seen the power belonging to God himself, hidden in its\nown qualities.'\n\nWhat is really peculiar in the _S_ veta _s_ vatara-upanishad is the strong\nstress which it lays on the personality of the Lord, the \xc3\x8e _s_ vara, Deva, in\nthe passage quoted, is perhaps the nearest approach to our own idea of a\npersonal God, though without the background which the Vedanta always retains\nfor it. It is God as creator and ruler of the world, as isvara, lord, but not\nas Paramatman, or the Highest Self. The Paramatman constitutes, no doubt, his\nreal essence, but creation and creator have a phenomenal character only 1. The\ncreation is maya, in its original sense of work, then of phenomenal work, then\nof illusion. The creator is mayin, in its original sense of worker or maker,\nbut again, in that character, phenomenal only 2. The Gunas or qualities arise,\naccording to the Vedanta, from prakriti or maya, within, not beside, the\nHighest Self, and this is the very idea which is here expressed by 'the Self-\npower of God, hidden in the gunas or determining qualities.' How easily that\nsakti or power may become an independent being, as Maya, we see in such verses\nas:\n\nSarvabhuteshu sarvatman ya _s_ aktir aparabhava  \nGu _n_ a _s_ raya namas tasyai _s_ a _s_ vatayai pare _s_ vara 3.\n\nBut the important point is this, that in the _S_ veta _s_ vatara-upanishad\nthis change has not taken place. Throughout the whole of it we have one Being\nonly, as the cause of everything, never two. Whatever Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya philosophers of\na later date may have imagined that they could discover in that Upanishad in\nsupport of their theories 4, there is not one passage in it which, if rightly\ninterpreted, not by itself, but in connection with the whole text, could be\nquoted in\n\np. xxxvii\n\nsupport of a dualistic philosophy such as the Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya, as a system, decidedly\nis.\n\nIf we want to understand, what seems at first sight contradictory, the\nexistence of a God, a Lord, a Creator, a Ruler, and at the same time the\nexistence of the super-personal Brahman, we must remember that the orthodox\nview of the Vedanta 1 is not what we should call Evolution, but Illusion.\nEvolution of the Brahman, or Pari _n_ ama, is heterodox, illusion or Vivarta\nis orthodox Vedanta. Brahman is a concept involving such complete perfection\nthat with it evolution, or a tendency towards higher perfection, is\nimpossible. If therefore there is change, that change can only be illusion,\nand can never claim the same reality as Brahman. To put it metaphorically, the\nworld, according to the orthodox Vedantin, does not proceed from Brahman as a\ntree from a germ, but as a mirage from the rays of the sun. The world is, as\nwe express it, phenomenal only, but whatever objective reality there is in it,\nis Brahman, 'das Ding an sich,' as Kant might call it.\n\nThen what is \xc3\x8e _s_ vara, or Deva, the Lord or God? The answers given to this\nquestion are not very explicit. Historically, no doubt, the idea of the \xc3\x8e _s_\nvara, the personal God, the creator and ruler, the omniscient and omnipotent,\nexisted before the idea of the absolute Brahman, and after the idea of the\nBrahman had been elaborated, the difficulty of effecting a compromise between\nthe two ideas, had to be overcome. \xc3\x8e _s_ vara, the Lord, is Brahman, for what\nelse could he be? But he is Brahman under a semblance, the semblance, namely,\nof a personal creating and governing God. He is not created, but is the\ncreator, an office too low, it was supposed, for Brahman. The power which\nenabled \xc3\x8e _s_ vara to create, was a power within him, not independent of him,\nwhether we call it Devatmasakti, Maya, or Prakriti. That power is really\ninconceivable, and it has assumed such different forms in the mind of\ndifferent Vedantists, that in the end Maya herself is represented as the\ncreating power, nay, as having created \xc3\x8e _s_ vara himself.\n\np. xxxviii\n\n[paragraph continues] In our Upanishad, however, \xc3\x8e _s_ vara is the creator,\nand though, philosophically speaking, we should say that be was conceived as\nphenomenal, yet we must never forget that the phenomenal is the form of the\nreal, and \xc3\x8e _s_ vara therefore an aspect of Brahman 1. 'This God,' says\nPramada Dasa Mitra 2, 'is the spirit conscious of the universe. Whilst an\nextremely limited portion, and that only of the material universe, enters into\nmy consciousness, the whole of the conscious universe, together, of course,\nwith the material one that hangs upon it, enters into the consciousness of\nGod.' And again, 'Whilst we (the _g_ ivatmans) are subject to Maya, Maya is\nsubject to \xc3\x8e _s_ vara. If we truly know \xc3\x8e _s_ vara, we know him as Brahman; if\nwe truly know ourselves, we know ourselves as Brahman. This being so, we must\nnot be surprised if sometimes we find \xc3\x8e _s_ vara sharply distinguished from\nBrahman, whilst at other times \xc3\x8e _s_ vara, and Brahman are interchanged.'\n\nAnother argument in support of the sectarian character of the _S_ veta _s_\nvatara-upanishad is brought forward, not by European students only, but by\nnative scholars, namely, that the very name of Kapila, the reputed founder of\nthe Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya philosophy, occurs in it. Now it is quite true that if we read the\nsecond verse of the fifth Adhyaya by itself, the occurrence of the word Kapila\nmay seem startling. But if we read it in connection with what precedes and\nfollows, we shall see hardly anything unusual in it. It says:\n\n'It is he who, being one only, rules over every germ (cause), over all forms,\nand over all germs; it is he who, in the beginning, bears in his thoughts the\nwise son, the fiery, whom he wished to look on while he was born.'\n\nNow it is quite clear to me that the subject in this verse is the same as in\nIV, II, where the same words are used, and where yo yoni _m_  yonim adhitish\n_th_ aty eka _h_ refers clearly to Brahman. It is equally clear that the\nprasuta, the son, the offspring of Brahman, in the Vedanta sense, can only be\nthe same person who is elsewhere called Hira _n_ yagarbha,\n\np. xxxix\n\nthe personified Brahman. Thus we read before, III, 4, 'He the creator and\nsupporter of the gods, Rudra, the great seer (maharshi), the lord of all,\nformerly gave birth to Hira _n_ yagarbha;' and in IV, 11, we have the very\nexpression which is used here, namely, 'that he saw Hira _n_ yagarbha being\nborn.' Unfortunately, a new adjective is applied in our verse to Hira _n_\nyagarbha, namely, kapila, and this has called forth interpretations totally at\nvariance with the general tenor of the Upanishad. If, instead of kapilam,\nreddish, fiery 1, any other epithet had been used of Hira _n_ yagarbha, no\none, I believe, would have hesitated for a moment to recognise the fact that\nour text simply repeats the description of Hira _n_ yagarbha in his relation\nto Brahman, for the other epithet _ri_ shim, like maharshim, is too often\napplied to Brahman himself and to Hira _n_ yagarbha to require any\nexplanation.\n\nBut it is a well known fact that the Hindus, even as early as the Brahma _n_\na-period, were fond of tracing their various branches of knowledge back to\nBrahman or to Brahman Svayambhu and then through Pra _g_ apati, who even in\nthe Rig-veda (X, 121, 10) replaces Hira _n_ yagarbha, and sometimes through\nthe Devas, such as Mrityu, Vayu, Indra, Agni 2, &c., to the various ancestors\nof their ancient families.\n\nIn the beginning of the Mu _n_ _d_ akopanishad we are told that Brahman told\nit to Atharvan, Atharvan to A\xe1\xb9\x85gir, A\xe1\xb9\x85gir to Satyavaha Bharadvaga, Bharadvaga\nto A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, A\xe1\xb9\x85giras to _S_ aunaka. Manu, the ancient lawgiver, is called both\nHaira _n_ yagarbha and Svayambhuva, as descended from Svayambhu or from Hira\n_n_ yagarbha 3. Nothing therefore was more natural than that the same tendency\nshould have led some one to assign the authorship of a great philosophical\nsystem like the Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya to Hira _n_ yagarbha, if not to Brahman Svayambhu. And\nif the name of Hira _n_ yagarbha had been used already for the ancestors of\nother sages, and the inspirers of other systems, what could be more natural\nthan that another name of the same Hira _n_ yagarbha\n\np. xl\n\nshould be chosen, such as Kapila. If we are told that Kapila handed his\nknowledge to \xc3\x82suri, \xc3\x82suri to Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a _s_ ikha, this again is in perfect\nkeeping with the character of literary tradition in India. \xc3\x82suri occurs in the\nVa _m_ sas of the _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a (see above, pp. 187, 226); Pa _\xc3\xb1_\n_k_ asikha 1, having five tufts, might be either a general name or a proper\nname of an ascetic, Buddhist or otherwise. He is quoted in the Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya-sutras,\nV, 32; VI, 68.\n\nBut after all this was settled, after Kapila had been accepted, like Hira _n_\nyagarbha, as the founder of a great system of philosophy, there came a\nreaction. People had now learnt to believe in a real Kapila, and when looking\nout for credentials for him, they found them wherever the word Kapila occurred\nin old writings. The question whether there ever was a real historical person\nwho took the name of Kapila and taught the Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya-sutras, does not concern us\nhere. I see no evidence for it. What is instructive is this, that our very\npassage, which may have suggested at first the name of Kapila, as distinct\nfrom Hira _n_ yagarbha, Kapila, was later on appealed to to prove the\nprimordial existence of a Kapila, the founder of the Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya philosophy.\nHowever, it requires but a very slight acquaintance with Sanskrit literature\nand very little reflection in order to see that the author of our verse could\nnever have dreamt of elevating a certain Kapila, known to him as a great\nphilosopher, if there ever was such a man, to a divine rank 2. Hira _n_\nyagarbha kapila may have given birth to Kapila, the hero of the Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya\nphilosophers, but Kapila, a real human person, was never changed into Hira _n_\nyagarbha kapila.\n\nLet us see now what the commentators say. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara first explains kapilam by\nkanaka _m_  3 kapilavar _n_ am . . . . Hira _n_ yagarbham. Kapilo 'gra _g_ a\niti pura _n_ ava _k_ anat. Kapilo Hira _n_ yagarbho va nirdi _s_ yate. But he\nafterwards quotes some verses in support of the theory that Kapila was a\n\np. xli\n\n[paragraph continues] Paramarshi, a portion of Vish _n_ u, intended to destroy\nerror in the K _ri_ ta Yuga, a teacher of the Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya philosophy.\n\nVig\xc3\xb1anatman explains the verse rightly, and without any reference to Kapila,\nthe Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya teacher.\n\n_S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85karananda goes a step further, and being evidently fully aware of the\nmisuse that had been made of this passage, even in certain passages of the\nMahabharata (XII, 13254, 13703), and elsewhere, declares distinctly that\nkapila cannot be meant for the teacher of the Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya (na tu sa\xe1\xb9\x85khyapra _n_\neta kapila _h_ , namamatrasamyena tadgraha _n_ e syad atiprasa\xe1\xb9\x85ga _h_ ). He is\nfully aware of the true interpretation, viz. avyak _ri_ tasya\nprathamakaryabhuta _m_ kapila _m_ vi _k_ itravar _n_ a _m_ _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anakriya\n_s_ aktyatmaka _m_ Hira _n_ yagarbham ityarthah, but he yields to another\ntemptation, and seems to prefer another view which makes Kapila\nVasudevasyavatarabuta _m_ Sagaraputra _n_ a _m_ dagdharam, an Avatara of\nVasudeva, the burner of the sons of Sagara. What vast conclusions may be drawn\nfrom no facts, may be seen in Weber's Indische Studien, vol. i, p. 430, and\neven in his History of Indian Literature, published in 1878.\n\nFar more difficult to explain than these supposed allusions to the authors and\nto the teaching of the Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya philosophy are the frequent references in the\n_S_ veta _s_ vatara-upanishad to definite numbers, which are supposed to point\nto certain classes of subjects as arranged in the Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya and other systems of\nphilosophy. The Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya philosophy is fond of counting and arranging, and its\nvery name is sometimes supposed to have been chosen because it numbers\n(sankhya) the subjects of which it treats. It is certainly true that if we\nmeet, as we do in the _S_ veta _s_ vatara-upanishad, with classes of things 1,\nnumbered as one, two, three, five, eight, sixteen, twenty, forty-eight, fifty\nand more, and if some of these numbers agree with those recognised in the\nlater Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya and Yoga systems, we feel doubtful as to whether these\ncoincidences are accidental, or whether, if not accidental, they are due to\nborrowing on the part of those later systems, or on the part\n\np. xlii\n\nit impossible to come to a decision on this point. Even so early as the hymns\nof the Rig-veda we meet with these numbers assigned to days and months and\nseasons, rivers and countries, sacrifices and deities. They clearly prove the\nexistence of a considerable amount of intellectual labour which had become\nfixed and traditional before the composition of certain hymns, and they prove\nthe same in the case of certain Upanishads. But beyond this, for the present,\nI should not like to go; and I must say that the attempts of most of the\nIndian commentators at explaining such numbers by a reference to later systems\nof philosophy or cosmology, are generally very forced and unsatisfactory.\n\nOne more point I ought to mention as indicating the age of the _S_ veta _s_\nvatara-upanishad, and that is the obscurity of many of its verses, which may\nbe due to a corruption of the text, and the number of various readings,\nrecognised as such, by the commentators. Some of them have been mentioned in\nthe notes to my translation.\n\nThe text of this Upanishad was printed by Dr. Roer in the Bibliotheca Indica,\nwith _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara's commentary. I have consulted besides, the commentary of Vi\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anatman, the pupil of Paramaha _m_ sa-parivra _g_ aka _k_ arya- _s_\nrimag- _G_ _\xc3\xb1_ anotta-ma _k_ arya, MS. I. O. 1133; and a third commentary, by\n_S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85karananda, the pupil of Paramaha _m_ sa-parivra _g_ aka _k_\naryanandatman, MS. I. O. 1878. These were kindly lent me by Dr. Rost, the\nlearned and liberal librarian of the India Office.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xxxi:1](sbe15007.htm#fr_29) Va _k_ aspatyam, p. 1222.\n\n[xxxi:2](sbe15007.htm#fr_30) Catal.
