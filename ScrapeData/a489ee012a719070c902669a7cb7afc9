The (term of the) studentship for (learning the) Veda, as kept by the\nancients, (is) forty-eight years, 1\n\n2\\. (Or) twenty-four (years), or twelve for each Veda, 2\n\n3\\. Or at the least one year for each Ka _n_ _d_ a, 3\n\n4\\. Or until (the Veda has been) learned; for life is uncertain. 4\n\n5\\. A passage of the revealed texts declares, \'Let him kindle the sacred fires\nwhile his hair is (still) black.\' 5\n\np. 150\n\n6\\. They do not put any (religious) restrictions on the acts of a (child)\nbefore the investiture with the girdle (is performed). For he is on a level\nwith a _S_ udra before (his second) birth through the Veda. 6\n\n7\\. The number of years (must be calculated) from the conception. Let him\ninitiate a Brahma _n_ a in the eighth (year) after that, 7\n\n8\\. A Kshatriya three (years) later (than a Brahma _n_ a),\n\n9\\. A Vai _s_ ya one year later than a (Kshatriya).\n\n10\\. Spring, summer, and autumn are the seasons (for the initiation) according\nto the order of the castes. 10\n\n11\\. (Let him perform the initiation reciting), according to the order (of the\ncastes), a Gayatri, a Trish _t_ ubh, (or) a _G_ agati (verse).\n\n12\\. Up to the sixteenth, the twenty-second, and the twenty-fourth (years)\nrespectively (the time for the initiation) has not passed. 12\n\n13\\. The girdles (shall consist of a rope) made of Mu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ a grass, a bow-\nstring, (or a rope) made of hemp. 13\n\n14\\. The skins (shall be) those of a black antelope, of a spotted deer, (or)\nof a he-goat. 14\n\n15\\. The staff shall reach the crown of the head, the forehead, (or) the tip\nof the nose, (and be made) of a tree fit for a sacrifice. The details have\nbeen stated above.  15\n\np. 151\n\n16\\. Let him beg, (employing a formula) consisting of seven syllables, with\nthe word bhavat in the beginning, with the word bhiksha in the middle, and\nwith the (verb expressing) the request at the end; and let him not pronounce\nloudly (the syllables) ksha and hi. 16\n\n17\\. A Brahma _n_ a (student) shall ask for alms, placing (the word) \'Lady\'\nfirst, a Kshatriya placing 17\n\np. 152\n\nit in the middle, (and) a Vai _s_ ya placing it at the end (of the formula),\nfrom (men of) all castes.\n\n18\\. The (persons fit to be asked) are Brahma _n_ as and so forth, who follow\n(their lawful) occupations.\n\n19\\. Let him daily fetch fuel out of the forest and offer (it in the sacred\nfire). 19\n\n20\\. (A student shall be) truthful, modest, and devoid of pride. 20\n\n21\\. He shall rise before (his teacher in the morning) and go to rest after\n(him in the evening). 21\n\n22\\. He shall never disobey the words of his teacher except (when he is\nordered to commit) a crime causing loss of caste. 22\n\n23\\. Let him converse with women so much (only) as his purpose requires. 23\n\n24\\. Let him avoid dancing, singing, playing musical instruments, the use of\nperfumes, garlands, shoes, (or) a parasol, applying collyrium (to his eyes),\nand anointing (his body). 24\n\n25\\. Let him take hold (of his teacher\'s) right (foot) with the right (hand),\nand of the left (foot) with the left hand. 25\n\n26\\. If he desires long life and (bliss in) heaven, 26\n\np. 153\n\n(he may act) at his pleasure (in the same manner) towards other holy (men),\nafter having received permission from his teacher.\n\n27\\. (Let him say), \'I N. N., ho! (salute thee),\' touching his ears, in order\nto compose the internal organ. 27\n\n28\\. (Let him embrace his teacher\'s leg) below the knee down to the feet. 28\n\n29\\. (A student shall not embrace his teacher) when he (himself) is seated, or\nlying down, or impure, nor when (his teacher) is seated, lying down, or\nimpure. 29\n\n30\\. If he can (find water to sip), he shall not remain impure even during a\nmuhurta. 30\n\n31\\. If he carries a load of fuel or holds a pot, flowers, or food in his\nhands, he shall not salute; nor (shall he do it) on similar occasions. 31\n\n32\\. Let him not salute (the teacher) standing too close,\n\n33\\. Nor, if he has reached the age of puberty, the young wives of brothers\nand the young wives of the teacher. 33\n\np. 154\n\n34\\. To sit together with (these persons) in a boat, on a rock, on a plank, on\nan elephant, on the roof of a house, on a mat, or in wheeled vehicles is\npermissible. 34\n\n35\\. (The pupil) must assist his teacher in making his toilet, shampoo him,\nattend him while bathing, eat his leavings, and so forth. 35\n\n36\\. (But he) should avoid the remnants of food left by his (teacher\'s) son,\nthough he may know the Veda together with the A\xe1\xb9\x85gas, 36\n\n37\\. And to assist at the toilet of, to shampoo, to attend in the bath, and to\neat the remnants of food left by a young wife of his (teacher).\n\n38\\. Let him run after (his teacher) when he runs, walk after him when he\nwalks, attend him standing when he stands. 38\n\n39\\. Let him not sport in the water while bathing. 39\n\n40\\. Let him swim (motionless) like a stick.\n\n41\\. To study under a non-Brahmanical teacher (is permitted) in times of\ndistress. 41\n\np. 155\n\n42\\. (The pupil shall) obey and walk after him as long as the instruction\n(lasts). 42\n\n43\\. (According to some this is improper, because) just that (mutual relation)\nsanctifies both of them. 43\n\n44\\. And (the behaviour) towards brothers, sons, and (other) pupils (of the\nteacher shall be regulated) in the same manner. 44\n\n45\\. But officiating priests, a father-in-law, paternal and maternal uncles\nwho are younger than (oneself must be honoured by) rising and (by being)\naddressed. 45\n\n46\\. Katya (declares that) the salutation shall be returned. 46\n\n47\\. For (the propriety of that rule) is apparent (from the story) about _S_ i\n_s_ u \xc3\x82\xe1\xb9\x85girasa. 47\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[149:1](sbe1436.htm#fr_755) **3**. \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 2, 12. Govindasvamin gives\nfour explanations of the adjective paura _n_ am, \'kept by the ancients,\' viz.\n1. old, i.e. kept by the men of the K _ri_ ta or Golden age; 2. revealed to\nand kept by the ancients, such as Manu; 3. found in the ancient, i.e. eternal\nVeda; 4. found in the known Itihasas and Pura _n_ as.\n\n[149:2](sbe1436.htm#fr_756) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 2, 14-16.\n\n[149:3](sbe1436.htm#fr_757) Each Ka _n_ _d_ a, i.e. each of the seven books of\nthe Taittiriya-sa _m_ hita.\n\n[149:4](sbe1436.htm#fr_758) Manu III, 1.\n\n[149:5](sbe1436.htm#fr_759) The object of the Sutra is to prove that the\nperiod of studentship must not be protracted too long, lest the duty of\noffering the _S_ rauta Agnihotra be neglected.\n\n[150:6](sbe1436.htm#fr_760) Vasish _th_ a II, 6; Gautama II, 1.\n\n[150:7](sbe1436.htm#fr_761)-9. Vasish _th_ a XI, 49-51.\n\n[150:10](sbe1436.htm#fr_762) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 1, 18.\n\n[150:12](sbe1436.htm#fr_763) Vasish _th_ a XI, 71-73.\n\n[150:13](sbe1436.htm#fr_764) Vasish _th_ a XI, 58-60. With this and the next\ntwo Sutras the words \'according to the order of the castes\' must be\nunderstood.\n\n[150:14](sbe1436.htm#fr_765) Vasish _th_ a XI, 61-63.\n\n[150:15](sbe1436.htm#fr_766) Vasish _th_ a XI, 55-57. The details referred to\nare to be p. 151 found in the Baudhayana G _ri_ hya-sutra II, 7, where the\nvarious kinds of trees from which the staff may be taken are specified. The\nSutra shows that the G _ri_ hya-sutra preceded the Dharma-sutra in the\ncollection.\n\n[151:16](sbe1436.htm#fr_767) The text of this Sutra is corrupt. I read,\n\'bhavatpurva _m_ bhikshamadhya _m_ ya _k_ _\xc3\xb1_ anta _m_ _k_ aret saptakshara\n_m_ bhiksha _m_ ksha _m_ _k_ a hi _m_ _k_ a na vardhayet\' The various readings\nof the MSS. are, bhiksha _m_ madhya _m_ ya _k_ _kh_ a _m_ ta _m_ _k_ aret\nsaptakshara _m_ bhim _k_ a na vardhayet, C. T.;--ya _k_ _\xc3\xb1_ a _m_ ta _m_ _k_\naret saptakshara _m_ _n_ i ksha _m_ _k_ a bhim _k_ a narvyayet, D.;-- ya _k_\n_\xc3\xb1_ a _m_ ta _m_ _k_ aret saptakshara _m_ sti _m_ rksha ba hi _m_ na\nvardhayet, K.; ya _k_ _\xc3\xb1_ a _m_ ta _m_ tiksha _m_ _k_ aret saptaksharan ksha\n_m_ _k_ a hi _m_ _k_ a na vardhayan, M.; ya _k_ ana _s_ _k_ a _m_ ta _m_ _k_\naret saptaksharan bhiksha _m_ ka him ka na vardhayet, C. I. The most serious\ncorruption lies in the syllables following saptakshara _m_ , and I am not\ncertain that my emendation bhiksha _m_ is correct. The commentary on the first\nhalf of the Sutra runs as follows: bhikshamantra _m_ vyaktam evo _k_ _k_ aret\nbhava _k_ _kh_ abdapurvam bhiksha _s_ abdamadhya _m_ ya _k_ _\xc3\xb1_\napratipa[pa]daka _s_ abda _m_ ta _m_ _s_ abdakshara _m_ [saptakshara _m_ ] _k_\na eva _m_ hi bhavati bhiksha _m_ dehi sa _m_ panno bhavati, \'let him pronounce\ndistinctly the formula employed in begging, beginning with the word bhavat,\nhaving the word bhiksha in the middle, and ending with the word conveying the\nsense of giving, and containing seven syllables. For thus (the formula),\n"Lady, give alms," becomes complete.\' It is curious that Govinda says nothing\nabout the form saptaksharam and the feminine terminations of the other\nadjectives, which do not agree with mantram, a masculine.\n\n[151:17](sbe1436.htm#fr_768) Vasish _th_ a XI, 68-70; Gautama II, 35. Govinda\nthinks that a student should, if possible, beg from people of his own caste.\nThree castes only are intended by the term \'from all castes.\' But see\n\xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 3, 25; Gautama VII, 1 seqq.\n\n[152:19](sbe1436.htm#fr_769) Vish _n_ u XXVIII, 4.\n\n[152:20](sbe1436.htm#fr_770) Gautama II, 8; \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 3, 20.\n\n[152:21](sbe1436.htm#fr_771) Vish _n_ u XXVIII, 13.\n\n[152:22](sbe1436.htm#fr_772) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 2, 19; Vasish _th_ a VII, 10.\n\n[152:23](sbe1436.htm#fr_773) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 3, 16.\n\n[152:24](sbe1436.htm#fr_774) Vish _n_ u XXVIII, 11; Vasish _th_ a VII, 15.\n\n[152:25](sbe1436.htm#fr_775) Vish _n_ u XXVIII, 15. The details regarding the\ntimes when this kind of salutation is to be performed are found \xc3\x82pastamba I,\n2, 5, 21 seqq.\n\n[152:26](sbe1436.htm#fr_776) The two copies of the commentary connect the\nclause, \'if he is desirous of long life and (bliss in) heaven,\' with the\npreceding Sutra. But see \xc3\x82pastamba I, 2, 5, 15, where the identical words p.\n153 occur. The commentary omits the remainder of the Sutra, which all my MSS.\ngive here, and inserts it below, after Sutra 29.\n\n[153:27](sbe1436.htm#fr_777) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 2, 5, 12; Vasish _th_ a XIII. 44.\nRegarding the phrase,\' in order to compose his internal organ,\' see Manu II,\n120.\n\n[153:28](sbe1436.htm#fr_778) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 2, 5, 22. The meaning seems to be\nthat the pupil is first to stroke his teacher\'s legs from the knee downwards,\nand then to take hold of it at the ankle.\n\n[153:29](sbe1436.htm#fr_779) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 4, 14, 14-20.\n\n[153:30](sbe1436.htm#fr_780) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 15, 8.\n\n[153:31](sbe1436.htm#fr_781) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 4, 14, 22. \'On similar occasions,\'\ni.e. when he himself is engaged in the worship of the manes, of the gods, or\nof the fire, or when his teacher is occupied in that way.\n\n[153:33](sbe1436.htm#fr_782) The salutation which is meant, is probably the\nembrace of the feet; see also Gautama II, 32. Govinda thinks that the words\nsamavaye \'tyantya _s_ a _h_ , \'standing too close,\' must be understood.\n\n[154:34](sbe1436.htm#fr_783) Govinda adds that to sit with young wives of his\nteachers on other occasions is sinful.\n\n[154:35](sbe1436.htm#fr_784) I read utsadana, \'to shampoo,\' while the MSS.\nhave either a lacuna or read u _k_ _kh_ adana, and the commentary a _k_ _kh_\nadana, which is explained by _kh_ attradhara _n_ a, \'to hold a parasol,\' or\nmalapakarsha _n_ a, \'to clean.\' The _k_ _kh_ a is, however, merely owing to a\nvery common faulty pronunciation of tsa. Govinda remarks correctly that the\nword \'iti,\' which follows the enumeration of the services to be performed by\nthe pupil, has the force of \'and so forth.\'\n\n[154:36](sbe1436.htm#fr_785)-37. The meaning of the two Sutras is that the\npupil shall serve the son of his teacher, especially if he is learned, and\naged wives of his teacher, but not eat their leavings. The explanation of anu\n_k_ ana, \'who knows the A\xe1\xb9\x85gas,\' is given by Baudhayana, G _ri_ hya-sutra I,\n11, 4.\n\n[154:38](sbe1436.htm#fr_786) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 2, 6, 7-9; Vasish _th_ a VII, 12.\n\n[154:39](sbe1436.htm#fr_787)-40. \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 2, 30; Vish _n_ u XXVIII, 5.\n\n[154:41](sbe1436.htm#fr_788) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 2, 4, 25. Govinda combines this\nSutra with the next two and makes one of the three.\n\n[155:42](sbe1436.htm#fr_789) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 2, 4, 26; Gautama VII, 2-3.\n\n[155:43](sbe1436.htm#fr_790) The words between brackets belong to Govinda.\n\n[155:44](sbe1436.htm#fr_791) I.e. if they are younger than oneself.\n\n[155:45](sbe1436.htm#fr_792) Instead of pratyutthayabhibhasha _n_ am, \'(shall\nbe honoured by) rising and being addressed,\' which is the reading of the two\ncopies of the commentary and of M., the MSS. from the Dekhan and Gu _g_ arat\nread, pratyutthayabhivadanam. The latter reading might be translated by \'shall\nbe saluted by rising;\' see Gautama VI, 9. Govinda says, in explanation of this\nrule: \'This restrictive rule also (refers) to teachers only, officiating\npriests, and the rest; to address (means) to use words such as "we come."\n\n[155:46](sbe1436.htm#fr_793) \'Katya, i.e. a descendant of the _Ri_ shi Kata.\nHe was of opinion that officiating priests and the rest must return the\nsalute. As the return of a salute is prescribed for them, it is understood\nthat the other (party) must salute.\'--Govinda.\n\n[155:47](sbe1436.htm#fr_794) The story of _S_ i _s_ u \xc3\x82\xe1\xb9\x85girasa is told, Manu\nII, 151-153.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Adhyaya 2, Ka _n_ _d_ ika 4](sbe1437.htm)\n\n'
