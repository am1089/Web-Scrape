Narada said :-- O Lord! Ganga, Lak _s_ mi, Sarasvati, and the world\npurifying Tulasi, these four, are dearest to Naraya _n_ a. Out of these, Ganga\nwent from the region of Goloka to Vaiku _nt_ ha. So I have heard. But how did\nShe come to be the wife of Naraya _n_ a. I have not heard. Kindly describe\nthis.\n\n\n\n3\\. Naraya _n_ a said :-- Brahma came from Goloka to the region of Vaiku _nt_\nha accompanied by Ganga.\n\n\n\n4-23. Brahma said to Naraya _n_ a :-- O Lord! Ganga, born of the bodies of\nRadha and Kri _sn_ a, full of youth, modest, extraordinarily beautiful, of\npure Suddha Sattva, and void of anger and egoism, does not like to marry\nanyone save Thee as She is born of Thee. But Radha is of a very proud nature\nand very wrathful. She was even ready to drink up Ganga. But Ganga at once and\nintelligently took refuge into the feet of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a. So the whole\nGoloka became void of water. Seeing this, I have come here to know in\nparticular the whole history of the case. Then S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, the Knower and\nthe Ruler of the hearts of all, came to know my heart and instantly caused\nGanga to issue from His toe and handed Her over to me. I bowed down to S\xc2\x92ri\nKri _sn_ a and now I have come with Ganga to Thee. Now Thou dost marry the\nSures'vari Ganga according to the Gandharva rule of marriage. As Thou art a\nDeva of taste and humorous in the assembly of the Devas, so Ganga is. As Thou\nart a gem amongst the males, so She is the gem amongst the females. And the\nunion of a humorous man with a humorous woman is exceedingly pleasant. Now\nmarry this Lady who has come of Her own\n\n\n\np. 863\n\n\n\naccord to Thee. S\xc2\x92ri Maha Lak _s_ mi becomes annoyed with one who does not\nmarry a woman who has come spontaneously. There is no doubt in this. The wise\nmen do never insult the Prak _r_ iti. All the Puru _s_ as (males) are born of\nPrak _r_ iti and all the females are parts of Prak _r_ iti. So Prak _r_ iti\nand Puru _s_ a are both inseparable and verily one and the same. So these two\nshould never insult each other. (If Thou sayest that Ganga is attached to Kri\n_sn_ a; how canst Thou marry Her. The reply is) As S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a is beyond\nthe attributes and beyond Prak _r_ iti, so Thou art also above Prak _r_ iti.\nThe one-half of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a is two-armed; the other half of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_\na is four-armed. Radha has appeared from the left side of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a. He\nHimself is the right half and Padma is His left-half. As there is no\ndifference between Radha and Kamala so there is no difference between S\xc2\x92ri Kri\n_sn_ a and Thee. Therefore as Ganga is born of Thy body, she wants to marry\nThee. As Prak _r_ iti and Puru _s_ a are really one and the same without any\ndifference, so the males and females are one. Thus speaking to Naraya _n_ a,\nBrahma handed Ganga over to Naraya _n_ a and went away. Naraya _n_ a, then,\nmarried Ganga smeared with sandal paste and flowers, according to the rules of\nthe Gandarbha marriage. The Lord of Lak _s_ mi then spent his time happily in\nenjoyment with Ganga. Ganga had to go to the earth (under the Bharati's curse)\nand afterwards returned to Vaiku _nt_ ha. As Ganga appeared from the feet of\nVi _sn_ u, She is denominated Vis _nu_ padi. Ganga Devi was very much\noverpowered with enjoyment in Her first intercourse with Naraya _n_ a; so much\nso that She remained motionless. Thus Ganga spent the days happily with Naraya\n_n_ a. Sarasvati\xc2\x92s jealousy towards Ganga did not disappear, though She was\nadvised by Lak _s_ mi Devi not to do so. Sarasvati cherished incessantly the\nfeeling of jealousy towards Ganga. But Ganga had not the least feeling of\njealousy towards Sarasvati.\n\n\n\nAt last, one day, when vexed too much, Ganga became angry and cursed Sarasvati\nto take Her birth in Bharata. So Lak _s_ mi, Sarasvati and Ganga were the\nwives of Naraya _n_ a. Lastly Tulasi became the wife of Naraya _n_ a. So the\nnumber of wives of Naraya _n_ a amounted to four.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fourteenth Chapter in the Ninth Book on the story of Ganga\nbecoming the wife of Naraya _n_ a in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 15](bk09ch15.htm)\n\n"
