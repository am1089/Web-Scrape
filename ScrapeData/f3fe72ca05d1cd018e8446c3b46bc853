But on account of its proximity (to the higher Brahman) there is\ndesignation (of the lower Brahman) as that.\n\nThe word 'but' indicates the setting aside of the doubt.--As the lower Brahman\nis in proximity to the higher one, there is nothing unreasonable in the word\n'Brahman' being applied to the former also. For when the higher Brahman is,\nfor the purposes of pious meditation, described as possessing certain effected\nqualities--such as consisting of mind and the rest--which qualities depend on\nits connexion with certain pure limiting adjuncts; then it is what we call the\nlower Brahman.--But with the assumption of the lower Brahman there does not\nagree what scripture says about the souls not returning; for there is no\npermanence anywhere apart from the highest Brahman. And scripture declares\nthat those who have set out on the road of the gods do not return, 'They who\nproceed on that path do not return to the life of man' ( _Kh_. Up. IV, 15, 6);\n'For them there is no return here' (B _ri_. Up. VI, 2, 15); 'Moving upwards by\nthat a man reaches immortality' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 6, 5).\n\nTo this objection we make the following reply.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 3, 10](sbe38311.htm)\n\n"
