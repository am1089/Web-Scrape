I would rather go without that six thousand. You must\nnow do another thing for me--go home at once, home to your mother."\n\nAmulya produced a small bundle and said: "But, sister, I have got the six\nthousand."\n\n"Where from?"\n\n"I tried hard to get gold," he went on, without replying to my question, "but\ncould not. So I had to bring it in notes."\n\n"Tell me truly, Amulya, swear by me, where did you get this money?"\n\n"That I will not tell you."\n\nEverything seemed to grow dark before my eyes. "What terrible thing have you\ndone, Amulya?" I cried. "Is it then ..."\n\n"I know you will say I got this money wrongly. Very well, I admit it. But I\nhave paid the full price for my wrong-doing. So now the money is mine."\n\nI no longer had any desire to learn more about it. My very blood-vessels\ncontracted, making my whole body shrink within itself.\n\n"Take it away, Amulya," I implored. "Put it back where you got it from."\n\n"That would be hard indeed!"\n\n"It is not hard, brother dear. It was an evil moment when you first came to\nme. Even Sandip has not been able to harm you as I have done."\n\nSandip\'s name seemed to stab him.\n\n"Sandip!" he cried. "It was you alone who made me come to know that man for\nwhat he is. Do you know, sister, he has not spent a pice out of those\nsovereigns he took from you? He shut himself into his room, after he left you,\nand gloated over the gold, pouring it out in a heap on the floor. \'This is not\nmoney,\' he exclaimed, \'but the petals of the divine lotus of power;\ncrystallized strains of music from the pipes that play in the paradise of\nwealth! I cannot find it in my heart to change them, for they seem longing to\nfulfil their destiny of adorning the neck of Beauty. Amulya, my boy, don\'t you\nlook at these with your fleshly eye, they are Lakshmi\'s smile, the gracious\nradiance of Indra\'s queen. No, no, I can\'t give them up to that boor of a\nmanager. I am sure, Amulya, he was telling us lies. The police haven\'t traced\nthe man who sank that boat. It\'s the manager who wants to make something out\nof it. We must get those letters back from him.\'\n\n"I asked him how we were to do this; he told me to use force or threats. I\noffered to do so if he would return the gold. That, he said, we could consider\nlater. I will not trouble you, sister, with all I did to frighten the man into\ngiving up those letters and burn them--it is a long story. That very night I\ncame to Sandip and said: \'We are now safe. Let me have the sovereigns to\nreturn them tomorrow to my sister, the Maharani.\' But he cried, \'What\ninfatuation is this of yours? Your precious sister\'s skirt bids fair to hide\nthe whole country from you. Say _Bande Mataram_ and exorcize the evil spirit.\'\n\n"You know, Sister Rani, the power of Sandip\'s magic. The gold remained with\nhim. And I spent the whole dark night on the bathing-steps of the lake\nmuttering _Bande Mataram_.\n\n"Then when you gave me your jewels to sell, I went again to Sandip. I could\nsee he was angry with me. But he tried not to show it. \'If I still have them\nhoarded up in any box of mine you may take them,\' said he, as he flung me his\nkeys. They were nowhere to be seen. \'Tell me where they are,\' I said. \'I will\ndo so,\' he replied, \'when I find your infatuation has left you. Not now.\'\n\n"When I found I could not move him, I had to employ other methods. Then I\ntried to get the sovereigns from him in exchange for my currency notes for six\nthousand rupees. \'You shall have them,\' he said, and disappeared into his\nbedroom, leaving me waiting outside. There he broke open my trunk and came\nstraight to you with your casket through some other passage. He would not let\nme bring it, and now he dares call it his gift. How can I tell how much he has\ndeprived me of? I shall never forgive him.\n\n"But, oh sister, his power over me has been utterly broken. And it is you who\nhave broken it!"\n\n"Brother dear," said I, "if that is so, then my life is justified. But more\nremains to be done, Amulya. It is not enough that the spell has been\ndestroyed. Its stains must be washed away. Don\'t delay any longer, go at once\nand put back the money where you took it from. Can you not do it, dear?"\n\n"With your blessing everything is possible, Sister Rani."\n\n"Remember, it will not be your expiation alone, but mine also. I am a woman;\nthe outside world is closed to me, else I would have gone myself. My hardest\npunishment is that I must put on you the burden of my sin."\n\n"Don\'t say that, sister. The path I was treading was not your path. It\nattracted me because of its dangers and difficulties. Now that your path calls\nme, let it be a thousand times more difficult and dangerous, the dust of your\nfeet will help me to win through. Is it then your command that this money be\nreplaced?"\n\n"Not my command, brother mine, but a command from above."\n\n"Of that I know nothing. It is enough for me that this command from above\ncomes from your lips. And, sister, I thought I had an invitation here. I must\nnot lose that. You must give me your _prasad_  26 before I go. Then, if I can\npossibly manage it, I will finish my duty in the evening."\n\nTears came to my eyes when I tried to smile as I said: "So be it."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[26](hw42.htm#fr_25) Food consecrated by the touch of a revered person.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XX](hw43.htm)\n\n'
