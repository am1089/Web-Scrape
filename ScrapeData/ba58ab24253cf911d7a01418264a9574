The due performance of it in its entirety\nis now taught. Hear me, O good woman! state this wonderful\n\np. 278\n\nmystery. The instrument, the action, the agent, and emancipation 1, these,\nindeed, O you of a (pure) heart! are the four Hot _ri_ s by whom this universe\nis enveloped. Hear also the assignment of causes exhaustively 2. The nose, and\nthe tongue, and the eye, and the skin, and the ear as the fifth, mind and\nunderstanding, these seven should be understood to be the causes of (the\nknowledge of 3) qualities. Smell, and taste, and colour, sound, and touch as\nthe fifth, the object of the mental operation and the object of the\nunderstanding 4, these seven are causes of action. He who smells, he who eats,\nhe who sees, he who speaks, and he who hears as the fifth, he who thinks, and\nhe who understands, these seven should be understood to be the causes of the\nagents 5. These 6, being possessed of qualities 7, enjoy their own qualities,\nagreeable and disagreeable. And I am here devoid of qualities. Thus these\nseven are the causes of emancipation 8. And among the learned who understand\n(everything), the\n\np. 279\n\nqualities 1 which are in the position of the deities, each in its own place,\nalways enjoy the offering according to prescribed rules. To him who is not\nlearned, eating various (kinds of) food, the (feeling of this or that being)\nmine adheres. And cooking food for himself, he, through the (feeling of this\nor that being) mine, is ruined 2. The eating of that which should not be\neaten, and drinking of intoxicating drinks also destroys him. He destroys the\nfood, and destroying that food he is destroyed in return. The learned man,\nbeing (himself) a ruler, destroying this food again produces it 3. And not\neven a trifling obstacle 4 arises to him from that food. Whatever is thought\nby the mind 5, whatever is spoken by speech, whatever is heard by the ear,\nwhatever is seen by the eye, whatever is touched by the sense of touch, and\nwhatever is smelt by the nose, absorbing all these offerings from all sides,\ntogether with those (senses) which with the mind are six 6, my fire 7 of\n(high) qualifications 8, shines dwelling within the body. My sacrifice of\nconcentration of mind is in progress, the performance of which yields the fire\n9 of knowledge;\n\np. 280\n\nthe Stotra in which, is the upward life-wind; the _S_ astra, the downward\nlife-wind; and which is very beneficial on account of the abandonment of\neverything 1; the Brahman priest in which, is the counsellor in all action 2;\nthe Hot _ri_ priest, the self the Adhvaryu priest, (the self) whose hymn of\npraise 3 is the offering; the Sastra of the Pra _s_ ast _ri_ , truth; and the\nDakshi _n_ a, final emancipation. On, this, too, _Rik_ verses are recited by\nthe men who understand Naraya _n_ a 4\\--the god Naraya _n_ a to whom they\nformerly offered animal 5 (offerings). On that Saman hymns 6, are sung, of\nwhich an illustration is stated 7.\n\np. 281\n\nO modest one! understand that god Naraya _n_ a, who is the self of everything.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[277:1](sbe0836.htm#fr_1323) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra understands these to be\nthree Savanas.\n\n[277:2](sbe0836.htm#fr_1324) Of taking into the na _d_ is the food digested in\nthe night, this is the morning Savanas; the afternoon Savana is the kindling\nof the gastric fire for digesting new food.\n\n[277:3](sbe0836.htm#fr_1325) The Vamadevya is a sukta beginning 'Kaya na _s_\n_k_ itra' (Rv. IV, 31, 1). The singing of it is the third Savana, Ar _g_ una\nMi _s_ ra. And see Taittiriya-aranyaka, p. 889.\n\n[277:4](sbe0837.htm#fr_1326) Cf. Aitareya-brahma _n_ a (Haug), pp. 132, 133.\n\n[278:1](sbe0837.htm#fr_1327) Cf. as to the three first, Gita, [p.\n123](sbe0820.htm#page_123). They are the four categories, to one or other of\nwhich everything in the world may be referred.\n\n[278:2](sbe0837.htm#fr_1328) The texts here differ. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra's\nreading he interprets to mean 'the subjugation of these Hotris.' The reading\nfollowed in the text seems to some extent to be supported by the sequel. But\nthe passage altogether is not very clear.\n\n[278:3](sbe0837.htm#fr_1329) So Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra--through these the\nknowledge of the qualities of objects of sense is acquired.\n\n[278:4](sbe0837.htm#fr_1330) The sensations, or perceptions, referred to lead\nto action.\n\n[278:5](sbe0837.htm#fr_1331) This seems to mean, that the powers of smelling,\n&c., when attributed to the self, make him appear as an agent, as an active\nprinciple.\n\n[278:6](sbe0837.htm#fr_1332) I. e. action, agent, and instrument, Ar _g_ una\nMi _s_ ra.\n\n[278:7](sbe0837.htm#fr_1333) I. e. the three, goodness, passion, and darkness.\n\n[278:8](sbe0837.htm#fr_1334) It is these seven from which the self is to be\nemancipated. must mean the self, not the Brahma _n_ a who speaks.\n\n[279:1](sbe0837.htm#fr_1335) I. e., I presume, the senses. Cf. Gita, [p.\n50](sbe0804.htm#page_50). The learned do. not suppose their self to have aught\nto do with them. Cf. Gita, [p. 64](sbe0807.htm#page_64).\n\n[279:2](sbe0837.htm#fr_1336) Cf. Gita, [p. 53](sbe0805.htm#page_53); Manu III,\n118.\n\n[279:3](sbe0837.htm#fr_1337) His knowledge gives him this power. He is not\n'destroyed' by the food as the other man is. Nilaka _nth_ a compares B _ri_\nhadara _n_ yaka, p. 884. See too [p. 260](sbe0832.htm#page_260), note\n[1](sbe0832.htm#fn_1239) supra.\n\n[279:4](sbe0837.htm#fr_1338) I. e. mischief owing to the destruction of life\nnecessary for getting food, says Nilaka _nth_ a quoting B _ri_ hadara _n_\nyaka, p. 913.\n\n[279:5](sbe0837.htm#fr_1339) This includes the operation of the understanding\nalso. Nilaka _nth_ a says this verse explains what the word 'food' means here.\n\n[279:6](sbe0837.htm#fr_1340) For the phrase cf. Gita, [p.\n112](sbe0817.htm#page_112).\n\n[279:7](sbe0837.htm#fr_1341) That is to say, my self, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\nSee [p. 259](sbe0832.htm#page_259), note  [3](sbe0832.htm#fn_1235) supra.\n\n[279:8](sbe0837.htm#fr_1342) As the objects of sense &c. are all absorbed into\nit.\n\n[279:9](sbe0837.htm#fr_1343) It is called 'fire,' as it burns up all action.\nCf. Gita, [p. 62](sbe0806.htm#page_62).\n\n[280:1](sbe0837.htm#fr_1344) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra's commentary is not\nintelligible here, so I follow Nilaka _nth_ a, but diffidently.\n\n[280:2](sbe0837.htm#fr_1345) I. e. the mind, say the commentators. 'Manta'\nsimply is given among the synonyms of Aha _n_ kara at Sa _n_ khya-sara, p. 16.\n\n[280:3](sbe0837.htm#fr_1346) I. e. the actions performed for knowledge of the\ntruth, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[280:4](sbe0837.htm#fr_1347) Nilaka _nth_ a refers to a _Rik_ 'Tapa asid-g\n_ri_ hapatih,' and also the famous allegory at the end of the Taittiriya-ara\n_n_ yaka. These are cited, he says, as authorities for this 'sacrifice\n(consisting of) concentration of mind.'\n\n[280:5](sbe0837.htm#fr_1348) I. e. the senses, Nilaka _nth_ a. Ar _g_ una Mi\n_s_ ra compares the whole passage with the Purusha Sukta, which are the _Rik_\nverses alluded to, according to him. He refers for further explanations to his\nown commentary on that sukta of the Rig-veda.\n\n[280:6](sbe0837.htm#fr_1349) They sing these hymns, out of the gratification\nproduced by knowledge of the self, says Nilaka _nth_ a, and he cites\nTaittiriya-ara _n_ yaka, p. 749. See also Taittiriya-upanishad, p. 138, and\n_S_ a _n_ kara's commentary there.\n\n[280:7](sbe0837.htm#fr_1350) The readings of our texts here are not very\nsatisfactory. The illustration is stated, says Nilaka _nth_ a, whose reading\nwe follow, by the Taittiriyas in the passage referred to in the last note. Ar\n_g_ una Mi _s_ ra's reading means 'such as Tahu _k_ ahu,' which would seem to\nbe the words of the Saman hymn referred to. But his commentary does not show\nwhat the words before him were. The whole figure as drawn out in this passage\nis not quite clear, though the general sense is pretty intelligible. Cf. the\nallegories at Aitareya-brahma _n_ a, pp. 132, 133, and at the close of the\nTaittiriya-ara _n_ yaka.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XI](sbe0838.htm)\n\n"
