Narada said :-- \xc2\x93O Bhagavan! I have heard all the anecdotes of Prakriti,\nas according to the S\xc2\x92astras, that lead to the freedom from birth and death in\nthis world. Now I want to hear the very secret history of S\xc2\x92ri Radha and Durga\nas described in the Vedas. Though you have told me about their glories, yet I\nam not satisfied. Verily, where is he whose heart does not melt away on\nhearing the glories of both of them! This world is originated from their parts\nand is being controlled by them. The devotion towards them frees one easily\nfrom the bonds of Samsara (rounds of birth and death). O Muni! Kindly describe\nnow about them.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n5-44. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! I am now describing the characters of\nRadha and Durga, as described in the Vedas; listen. I did not describe to\nanybody this Secret which is the Essence of all essences and Higher than the\nhighest. This is to be kept very secret. Hearing this, one ought not to\ndivulge it to any other body. Radha presides over the Pra _n_ a and Durga\npresides over the Buddhi. From these two, the Mulaprakriti has originated this\nworld. These two S\xc2\x92aktis guide the whole world. From the Mahavirat to the\nsmall insect, all, moving or non-moving, are under the Mulaprakriti. One must\nsatisfy them. Unless these two be satisfied, Mukti cannot be obtained.\n\n\n\nTherefore one ought to serve Mula Prakriti for Her satisfaction. Now of the\ntwo in Mula Prakriti, I will describe fully the Radha Mantra. Listen. Brahma,\nVi _sn_ u, and others always worship this mantra. The principal mantra is\n\xc2\x93S\xc2\x92ri Radhayai Svaha.\xc2\x94 By this six lettered mantra Dharma and other fruits all\nare obtained with ease. If to this six lettered Mula mantra Hrim be added, it\nyields gems and jewels as desired. So much so, if thousand ko _t_ i mouths and\none hundred ko _t_ i tongues are obtained, the glory of this mantra cannot be\ndescribed. When the incorporeal voice of Mula Prakriti was heard in the\nHeavens, this mantra was obtained, first by Kri _sn_ a in the Rasa Ma _nd_\nalam in the region of Goloka where all love sentiments are played. (The Vedas\ndeclare him as Raso vai Sah). From Kri _sn_ a, Vi _sn_ u got the Mantra; from\nVi _sn_ u, Brahma got; from Brahma\n\n\n\np. 1003\n\n\n\nVirat got, from Virat, Dharma, and from Dharma I have got this Mantra.\nRepeating that Mantra, I am known by the name of Ri _s_ i. Brahma and the\nother Devas meditate always on the Mula Prakriti with greatest joy and\necstasy. Without the worship of Radha, never can the worship of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_\na be done. So men, devoted to Vi _sn_ u, should first of all worship Radha by\nall means. Radha is the Presiding Deity of the Pra _n_ a of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a.\nHence S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a is so much subject to Radha. The Lady of the Rasa Ma\n_nd_ alam remains always close to Him. Without Her S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a could not\nlive even for a moment. The name Radha is derived from \xc2\x93Radhnoti\xc2\x94 or fulfills\nall desires. Hence Mula Prakriti is termed Radha. I am the Ri _s_ i of all the\nmantras but the Durga Mantra mentioned in this Ninth Skandha. Gayatri is the\nchhanda (mantra) of those mantras and Radhika is the Devata of them. Really,\nNaraya _n_ a is the Ri _s_ i of all the mantras; Gayatri is the chhanda; Pra\n_n_ ava (om) is the Vija (seed) and Bhuvanes\xc2\x92vari (the Directrix of the world)\nis the S\xc2\x92akti. First of all the principal mantra is to be repeated six times;\nthen meditation of the great Devi Radhika, the S\xc2\x92akti of the Ri _s_ is is to\nbe done, as mentioned in the Sama Veda. The meditation of Radha is as follows\n:-- O Devi Radhike! Thy colour is like white Champaka flower; Thy face is like\nthe autumnal Full Moon; Thy body shines with the splendour of ten million\nmoons, Thy eyes look beautiful like autumnal lotus; Thy lips are red like\nBimba fruits, Thy loins are very heavy and decked with the girdle (Kanchi)\nornament; Thy face is always gracious with sweet smiles; Thy breasts defy the\nfrontal globe of an elephant. Thou art ever youthful as if twelve years old;\nThy body is adorned all over with ornaments! Thou art the waves of the ocean\nof S\xc2\x92ringara (love sentiments.) Thou art ever ready to show Thy grace to the\ndevotees; on Thy braid of hair garlands of Mallika and Malati are shining; Thy\nbody is like a creeping plant, very gentle and tender; Thou art seated in the\nmiddle of Rasa Ma _nd_ alam as the Chief Directrix; Thy one hand is ready to\ngrant boons and another hand expresses \xc2\x93Have no fear.\xc2\x94 Thou art of a peaceful\nappearance; Thou art ever youthful; Thou art seated on a jewel throne; Thou\nart the foremost guide of the Gopikas; Thou art dearer to Kri _sn_ a than even\nHis life; O Parame\xc2\x92svari! The Vedas reveal Thy nature. Meditating thus, one is\nto bathe the Devi on a S\xc2\x92alagrama stone, jar, yantra or the eight petalled\nlotus and then worship Her duly. First the Devi is to be invoked; then Padya\nand \xc3\x82sana, etc., are to be offered, the principal Mantra being pronounced at\nevery time an offering\n\n\n\np. 1004\n\n\n\nis given. After giving water for washing both the feet, Arghya is to be placed\non the head and \xc3\x82chamaniyam water to be offered three times on the face.\nMadhuparka (an oblation of honey, milk etc.) and a cow giving a good quantity\nof milk are next to be offered. Then the yantra is to be thought of as the\nbathing place where the Devi is to be bathed. Then Her body is to be wiped and\na fresh cloth given for putting on. Sandalpaste and various other ornaments\nare next to be given. Various garlands of flowers with Tulasi Manjari (flower\nstalks) Parijata flower and Satapatra etc., then, are to be offered. Then\nwithin the eight petals, the family members of the Devi are to be thought of;\nworship is next to be offered in the right hand direction (with the hands of\nthe watch). First of all, Malavati on the petal in front of (on the east) the\nDevi, then Madhavi on the southeast corner, then Ratnamala on the south,\nSus\xc2\x92ila on the south-west, Sas\xc2\x92ikala on the west, Parijata on the north-west,\nParavati on the north and the benefactious Sundari on the north-east corner\nare to be worshipped in order. Outside this, Brahmi and the other Matrikas are\nto be worshipped and on the Bhupuras (the entrances of the yantra,) the\nRegents of the quarters, the Dikpalas and the weapons of the Devi,\nthunderbolt, etc., are to be worshipped . Then all the attendant Deities of\nthe Devi are to be worshipped with scents and various other articles. Thus\nfinishing the worship, one should chant the _S_ totra (hymns) named Sahasra-\nnama (thousand names) _S_ totra with care and devotion. O Narada! The\nintelligent man who worships thus the Rases\xc2\x92vari Devi Radha, becomes like Vi\n_sn_ u and goes to the Goloka.\n\n\n\nHe who performs the birthday anniversary of S\xc2\x92ri Radha on the Full-Moon day of\nthe month of Kartik, gets the blessings of S\xc2\x92ri Radha who remains near to him.\nFor some reason Radha, the dweller in Goloka was born in Brindaban as the\ndaughter of Vri _s_ avanu. However, according to the number of letters of the\nmantras that are mentioned in this chapter, Pura _s_ chara _n_ a is to be made\nand Homa, one-tenth of Pura _s_ chara _n_ a, is to be then performed. The Homa\nis to be done with ghee, honey, and milk; the three sweet things mixed with\nTil and with devotion.\n\n\n\n45\\. Narada said :-- \xc2\x93O Bhagavan; Now describe the _S_ totra (hymn) Mantra by\nwhich the Devi is pleased.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n46-100. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! Now I am saying the Radha _S_ totra.\nListen. O Thou, the Highest Deity, the Dweller in Rasa Ma _nd_ alam! I bow\ndown to Thee; O Thou, the Chief Directrix of the Rasa Ma _nd_ alam; O Thou\ndearer to Kri _sn_ a than His life even, I bow down to Thee. O Thou, the\nMother of the three Lokas! O Thou the Ocean of\n\n\n\np. 1005\n\n\n\nmercy! Be pleased. Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and the other Devas bow down before Thy\nlotus feet. Thou art Sarasvati; Thou art Savitri; Thou art S\xc2\x92ankari; I bow\ndown to Thee; Thou art Ganga; Thou art Padmavati; Thou art _S_ a _st_ hi; Thou\nart Mangala Cha _nd_ ika; Thou art Manasa; Thou art Tulasi; Thou art Durga;\nThou art Bhagavati; Thou art Lak _s_ mi; Thou art all, I bow down to Thee.\nThou art the Mula Prakriti; Thou art the Ocean of mercy. Obeisance to Thee! Be\nmerciful to us and save us from this ocean of Samsara (round of birth and\ndeath). O Narada! Anybody who remembers Radha and reads this _S_ totra three\ntimes a day does not feel the want of anything in this world. He will\nultimately go to Goloka and remain in the Rasa Ma _nd_ alam. O Child This\ngreat secret ought never to be given out to any. Now I am telling you the\nmethod of worship of the Durga Devi. Hear. When any one remembers Durga in\nthis world, all his difficulties and troubles are removed. It is not seen that\nanybody does not remember Durga. She is the object of worship of all. She is\nthe Mother of all and the Wonderful S\xc2\x92akti of Mahadeva. She is the Presiding\nDeity of the intellect (Buddhi) of all and She controls the hearts of all and\nShe removes the great difficulties and dangers of all. Therefore She is named\nDurga in the world. She is worshipped by all, whether a S\xc2\x92aiva or a Vai _sn_\nava. She is the Mula Prakriti and from Her the creation, preservation and\ndestruction of the universe proceed. O Narada! Now I am saying the principal\nnine lettered Durga Mantra, the best of all the Mantras. \xc2\x93Aim Hrim Klim Chamu\n_nd_ ayai Vichche\xc2\x94 is the nine lettered Vija mantra of S\xc2\x92ri Durga; it is like\na Kalpa Vrik _s_ a yielding all desires. One should worship this mantra by all\nmeans. Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, and Mahes\xc2\x92a are the Ri _s_ is of this mantra;\nGayatri, U _sn_ ik and Anu _st_ hubha are the chhandas; Mahakali, Maha Lak _s_\nmi and Sarasvati are the Devatas; Rakta Dantika, Durga, and Bhramari are the\nVijas. Nanda, Sakambhari, and Bhima are the S\xc2\x92aktis and Dharma (Virtue), Artha\n(wealth) and Kama (desires), are the places of application (Viniyoga). Assign\nthe head to the Ri _s_ i of the mantra (Nyasa); assign the chhandas to the\nmouth and assign the Devata to the heart. Then assign the S\xc2\x92akti to the right\nbreast for the success and assign the Vija to the left breast.\n\n\n\nThen perform the _S_ a _d_ amga Nyasa as follows :-- Aim Hridayaya namah, Hrim\nS\xc2\x92irase Svaha, Klim S\xc2\x92ikhayam Va _s_ a _t_ , Chamu _nd_ ayai Kavachaya Hum,\nVichche Netrabhyam Vau _s_ a _t_ , \xc2\x93Aim Hrim Klim Chamu _nd_ ayai Vichche\xc2\x94\nKaratalapri _s_ ihabhyam Pha _t_. Next say touching the corresponding parts of\nthe body :-- \xc2\x93Aim namah S\xc2\x92ikhayam, Hrim Namah\xc2\x94 on the right eye; \xc2\x93Klim Namah\xc2\x94\non the left eye, \xc2\x93Cham Namah\xc2\x94 on\n\n\n\np. 1006\n\n\n\nthe right ear, \xc2\x93Mum namah\xc2\x94 on the left ear, _nd_ am Namah\xc2\x94 on the nostrils;\n\xc2\x93Vim Namah\xc2\x94 on the face; \xc2\x93Chchem Namah\xc2\x94 on the anus and finally \xc2\x93Aim Hrim Klim\nChamu _nd_ ayai Vichche\xc2\x94 on the whole body. Then do the meditation (dhyan)\nthus :-- \xc2\x93O Chamu _nd_ e! Thou art holding in Thy ten hands ten weapons, viz.,\nKha _d_ ga (axe), Chakra (disc), Gada (club), Va _n_ a (arrows), Chapa (bow),\nParigha, Sula (spear), Bhus\xc2\x92u _nd_ i Kapala, and Kha _d_ ga. Thou art Maha\nKali; Thou art three-eyed; Thou art decked with various ornaments. Thou\nshinest like Lilanjan (a kind of black pigment). Thou hast ten faces and ten\nfeet. The Lotus born Brahma chanted hymns to Thee for the destruction of Madhu\nKaitabha; I bow down to Thee.\xc2\x94 Thus one should meditate on Maha Kali, of the\nnature of Kamavija (the source whence will comes). Then the Dhyanam of Maha\nLaksmi runs as follows :-- O Maha Lak _s_ mi, the destroyer of Mahi _s_ asura!\nThou holdest the garland of Ak _s_ a (a kind of seed), Paras\xc2\x92u (a kind of\naxe), Gada (club), I _s_ u (arrows), Kulis\xc2\x92a (the thunderbolt) Padma (Lotus),\nDhanu (bow), Ku _n_ dika (a student\xc2\x92s waterpot), Kama _n_ dalu, Da _nd_ a (rod\nfor punishment), S\xc2\x92akti (a kind of weapon), Asi (sword), Charma (shield) Padma\n(a kind of waterlily), Gha _nt_ a (bell,) S\xc2\x92urapatra (a pot to hold liquor),\nS\xc2\x92ula (pickaxe), Pas\xc2\x92a (noose) and Sudar _s_ ana (a kind of weapon). Thy\ncolour is of the Rising Sun. Thou art seated on the red Lotus. Thou art of the\nnature Mayavija (the source whence female energy comes). So Obeisance to Thee!\n(The Vija and the Devi are one and identical). Next comes the Dhyanam of Maha\nSarasvati as follows :-- O Maha Sarasvati! Thou holdest bell, pickaxe, plough\n(Hala), Conch shell, Mu _s_ ala (a kind of club), Sudars\xc2\x92ana, bow and arrows.\nThy colour is like Ku _nd_ a flower; Thou art the destroyer of S\xc2\x92umbha and the\nother Daityas; Thou art of the nature of Va _n_ ivija (the source whence\nknowledge, speech comes). Thy body is filled with everlasting existence,\nintelligence and bliss. Obeisance to Thee! O Narada! Now I am going to say on\nthe Yantra of Maha Sarasvati. Listen. First draw a triangle. Draw inside the\ntriangle eight petalled lotus having twenty-four leaves. Within this draw the\nhouse. Then on the Yantra thus drawn, or in the S\xc2\x92alagrama stone, or in the\njar, or in image, or in the Va _n_ ali _n_ gam, or on the Sun, one should\nworship the Devi with oneness of heart. Then worship the Pi _t_ ha, the\ndeities seated also on the dais, i.e., Jaya, Vijaya, Ajita, Aghora, Mangala\nand other Pi _t_ ha S\xc2\x92aktis. Then worship the attendant deities called \xc3\x82vara\n_n_ a Puja :-- Brahma with Sarasvati on the east, Naraya _n_ a with Lak _s_ mi\non the Nairirit corner, S\xc2\x92ankara with Parvati on the Vayu corner, the Lion on\nthe north of the Devi, and Mahasura on the left side of the Devi; finally\nworship Mahi _s_ a (buffalo). Next worship\n\n\n\np. 1007\n\n\n\nNandaja, Raktadanta, S\xc2\x92akambhari, S\xc2\x92iva, Durga, Bhima, and Bhramari. Then on\nthe eight petals worship Brahma, Mahes\xc2\x92vari, Kaumari, Vai _sn_ avi, Varahi,\nNara Simhi, Aindri, and Chamu _nd_ a. Next commencing from the leaf in front\nof the Devi, worship on the twenty four leaves Vi _sn_ u Maya, Chetana,\nBuddhi, Nidra (sleep), hunger, shadow, S\xc2\x92akti, thirst, peace, species (Jati),\nmodesty, faith, fame, Lak _s_ mi (wealth), fortitude, Vriti, S\xc2\x92ruti, memory,\nmercy, Tu _st_ i, Pu _st_ i (nourishment), Bhranti (error) and other Matrikas.\nNext on the corners of the Bhupura (gates of the Yantra), Ganes\xc2\x92a K _s_\nettrapalas, Va _t_ uka and Yoginis are to be worshipped. Then on the outside\nof that Indra and the other Devas furnished with weapons are to be worshipped\nas per the aforesaid rules. For the satisfaction of the World-Mother various\nnice offerings and articles like those given by the royal personages are to be\npresented to the Mother; then the mantra is to be repeated, understanding its\nexoteric and esoteric meanings. Then Saptas\xc2\x92ati stitra (Cha _nd_ i pa _t_ ha)\nis to be repeated before the Devi. There is no other stotra like this in the\nthree worlds. Thus Durga, the Deity of the Devas, is to be appeased every day.\nHe who does this gets within his easy reach Dharma, Artha, Kama, and Mok _s_\na, the four main objects of human pursuits (virtue, wealth, enjoyment and\nfinal beatitude). O Narada! Thus I have described to you the method of worship\nof the Devi Durga. People get by this what they want. Hari, Brahma, and all\nthe Devas, Manus, Munis, the Yogis full of knowledge, the \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92ramis, and Lak\n_s_ mi and the other Devas all meditate on S\xc2\x92ivani. One\xc2\x92s birth is attained\nwith success at the remembrance of Durga. The fourteen Manus have got their\nManuship and the Devas their own rights by meditating on the lotus feet of\nDurga. O Narada! Thus I have described to you the very hidden histories of the\nFive Prakritis and their parts. Then, verily, the four objects of human\npursuits Dharma, Artha, Kama and Mok _s_ a are obtained by hearing this. He\nwho has no sons gets sons, who has no learning gets learning and whoever wants\nanything gets that if he hears this. The Devi Jagaddhatri becomes certainly\npleased with him who reads with his mind concentrated on this for nine nights\nbefore the Devi. The Devi becomes obedient to him who daily reads one chapter\nof this Ninth Skandha and the reader also does what is acceptable to the Devi.\nTo ascertain before-hand what effects, merits or demerits, would accrue from\nreading this Bhagavata, it is necessary by examining through the hands of a\nvirgin girl or a Brahmi _n_ child, the auspicious or inauspicious signs. First\nmake a Sankalpa (resolve) and worship the book. Then bow down again and again\nto the Devi Durga. Then bring there a virgin girl, bathed well and worship her\nduly and have a golden pencil fixed duly in her\n\n\n\np. 1008\n\n\n\nhand and placed in the middle on the body. Then calculate the auspicious or\ninauspicious effects, as the case may be, from the curves made by that pencil.\nSo the effects of reading this Bhagavata would be. If the virgin girl be\nindifferent in fixing the pencil within the area drawn, know the result of\nreading the Bhagavata would be similar. There is no doubt in this.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fiftieth Chapter of the Ninth Book on the Glory of S\xc2\x92akti in the\nMahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda\nVyasa.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Ninth Book.\n\n\n\nThe Ninth Book Completed.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 1](bk10ch01.htm)\n\n'
