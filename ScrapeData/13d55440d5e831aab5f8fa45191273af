Learn now\nof what description is the institution of the ten sacrificial priests 1. The\near 2, the tongue, the nose, the two feet, the two hands, speech, the genital\norgan, and the anus, these, verity, are ten sacrificial priests, O beautiful\none! Sound, touch, colour, and taste, smell, words, action, motion, and the\ndischarge of semen, urine, and excrement, these are the ten oblations. The\nquarters, wind, sun, moon, earth and fire, and Vish _n_ u also, Indra, Pra _g_\napati, and Mitra, these, O beautiful one! are the ten fires 3. The ten organs\nare the makers of the offering; the offerings are ten, O beautiful one!\nObjects of sense, verily, are the fuel; and they are offered up into the ten\nfires. The mind is the ladle 4; and the wealth is the pure, highest knowledge}\n5. (Thus) we have heard, was the universe duly divided 6. And the mind, which\nis the instrument\n\np. 262\n\nof knowledge, requires everything knowable 1 (as its offering). The mind is\nwithin the body the upholder of the frame, and the knower is the upholder of\nthe body 2. That 3 upholder of the body is the Garhapatya fire; from that\nanother is produced, and the mind which is the \xc3\x82havaniya; and into this the\noffering is thrown. Then the lord of speech was produced 4; that (lord of\nspeech) looks up to the mind. First, verily, are words produced; and the mind\nruns after them.\n\np. 263\n\nThe Brahma _n_ a's wife said:\n\nHow did speech come into existence first, and how did the mind come into\nexistence afterwards, seeing that words are uttered (after they have been)\nthought over by the mind? By means of what experience does intelligence come\nto the mind, and (though) developed, does not comprehend 1? What verily\nobstructs it?\n\nThe Brahma _n_ a said:\n\nThe Apana becoming lord changes it into the state of the Apana in consequence.\nThat is called the movement of the mind, and hence the mind is in need (of it)\n2. But since you ask me a question regarding speech and mind, I will relate to\nyou a dialogue between themselves. Both speech and mind went to the self of\nall beings 3 and spoke (to him thus), 'Say which of us is superior; destroy\nour doubts, O lord!' Thereupon the lord positively said to speech, 'Mind (is\nsuperior).' But speech thereupon said to him, 'I, verily, yield (you) your\ndesires 4.'\n\np. 264\n\nThe Brahma _n_ a 1 said:\n\nKnow, that (in) my (view), there are two minds 2, immovable and also movable.\nThe immovable, verily, is with me; the movable is in your dominion. Whatever\nmantra, or letter, or tone goes to your dominion, that indeed is the movable\nmind 3. To that you are superior. But inasmuch, O beautiful one I as you came\npersonally to speak to me (in the way you did) 4, therefore, O Sarasvati! you\nshall never speak after (hard) exhalations 5. The goddess speech, verily,\ndwelt always between the Pra _n_ a and Apana 6. But, O noble one! going with\nthe Apana\n\np. 265\n\nwind 1, though impelled, (in consequence of) being without the Pra _n_ a, she\nran up to Pra _g_ apati, saying, 'Be pleased 2, O venerable sir!' Then 3 the\nPra _n_ a appeared again nourishing speech. And therefore speech never speaks\nafter (hard) exhalation. It is always noisy or noiseless. Of those two, the\nnoiseless is superior to the noisy 4 (speech). This excellent (speech), like a\ncow, yields milk 5, and speaking of the Brahman it always produces the eternal\n(emancipation). This cow-like speech, O you of a bright smile! is divine, with\ndivine 6 power. Observe the difference of (its) two subtle, flowing (forms) 7.\n\nThe Brahma _n_ a's wife said:\n\nWhat did the goddess of speech say on that occasion in days of old, when,\nthough (she was) impelled with a desire to speak, words could not be uttered?\n\nThe Brahma _n_ a said:\n\nThe (speech) which is produced in the body by\n\np. 266\n\nmeans of the Pra _n_ a [1](sbe0834.htm#fn_1274), and which then goes into the\nApana, and then becoming assimilated with the Udana leaves the body\n[2](sbe0834.htm#fn_1275), and with the Vyana envelopes all the quarters\n[3](sbe0834.htm#fn_1276), then (finally) dwells in the Samana\n[4](sbe0834.htm#fn_1277). So speech formerly spoke. Hence the mind is\ndistinguished by reason of its being immovable, and the goddess distinguished\nby reason of her being movable [5](sbe0834.htm#fn_1278).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[261:1](sbe0833.htm#fr_1252) Cf. Taittiriya-brahma _n_ a, p. 411, and \xc3\x82ra _n_\nyaka, p. 281.\n\n[261:2](sbe0833.htm#fr_1253) Cf. B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p. 459. The reading\nin the printed edition of Bombay is defective here.\n\n[261:3](sbe0833.htm#fr_1254) See [p. 337](sbe0854.htm#page_337) seq., where\nall this is more fully explained. And cf. the analogous Buddhistic doctrine\nstated at Lalita Vistara (Translation by Dr. R. Mitra), p. 11.\n\n[261:4](sbe0833.htm#fr_1255) See Taittiriya-ara _n_ yaka loc. cit., and cf.\nGita, [p. 61](sbe0806.htm#page_61). 'The wealth' probably means the Dakshi _n_\na to be given to the priests, which is mentioned at Gita, [p.\n119](sbe0819.htm#page_119).\n\n[261:5](sbe0833.htm#fr_1256) The 'priests' here being the senses, the\nknowledge would accrue to them, as to which cf. Gita, [p.\n108](sbe0816.htm#page_108).\n\n[261:6](sbe0833.htm#fr_1257) See note  3.\n\n[262:1](sbe0833.htm#fr_1258) Each sense can only offer up its own perceptions\n--the mind offers up all knowledge whatever.\n\n[262:2](sbe0833.htm#fr_1259) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says this is an implied\nsimile, the mind is an upholder of the body as the, 'knower' or self is.\n\n[262:3](sbe0833.htm#fr_1260) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says this means 'the mind.'\nI think it better to take it here as the self (see [p.\n238](sbe0829.htm#page_238) supra), to which the 'mind' and the 'other,'\nmentioned further on, would be subordinate; the 'other' Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra\nrenders by the 'group of the senses.' The senses are compared to fires at\nGita, [p. 61](sbe0806.htm#page_61). The passage at Taittiriya-aranyaka above\ncited refers only to the Garhapatya and \xc3\x82havaniya fires. Nilaka _nth_ a's text\nand explanation of this passage are, to my mind, not nearly so satisfactory as\nAr _g_ una Mi _s_ ra's.\n\n[262:4](sbe0833.htm#fr_1261) In the Taittiriya-brahmana and \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka loc.\ncit., the equivalent of the original word for 'lord of speech' here occurs,\nviz. Vakpati for Va _k_ aspati here; but that is there described as the Hot\n_ri_ priest, and speech itself as the Vedi or altar. The commentator there\ninterprets 'lord of speech' to mean the wind which causes vocal activity, and\nresides in the throat, palate, &c. As to mind and speech, see also _Kh_\nandogya, pp. 285-441, and comments of _S_ a _n_ kara there. The meaning of\nthis passage, however, is not by any means clear to my mind. The Da _s_ ahot\n_ri_ mantras in the Taittiriya are stated to be the mantras of the Ish _t_ i,\nor sacrifice, performed by Pra _g_ apati for creation. It is possible, then,\nthat the meaning here is, that speech which is to be learnt by the pupil, as\nstated further on--namely, the Vedas--was first produced from that Ish _t_ i\n(cf. Kulluka on Manu I, 21). But to understand that speech, mind is necessary;\nhence it is said to look up to the mind. The Brahma _n_ a's, wife, however,\nseems to understand speech as ordinary speech, hence her question.\n\n[263:1](sbe0833.htm#fr_1262) This, again, is to my mind very hard to\nunderstand. The original word for 'intelligence' is mati, which at _Kh_\nandogya, p. 514, _S_ a _n_ kara interprets thus: 'intelligence is pondering,\napplication to (literally, respect for) the subject of thought.' The original\nfor 'developed,' Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra renders by 'mixed or assimilated with;'\nand 'does not comprehend,' he takes to mean 'does not understand--speech or\nwords.' This question appears to suggested by the last words of the, previous\nspeech.\n\n[263:2](sbe0833.htm#fr_1263) These two sentences are again very obscure.\nNilaka _nth_ a, as usual, deserts his original, giving peculiar meanings to\nthe words without producing any authority. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra is very\nmeagre, and besides the MS. is very incorrect. See p. 264, note  5 infra.\n\n[263:3](sbe0833.htm#fr_1264) I. e. Pra _g_ apati, says Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra,\nwhich seems to be justified by the sequel. Nilaka _nth_ a takes it to mean the\nindividual self, which doubtless is its meaning elsewhere, e.g. Maitri, p. 56.\n\n[263:4](sbe0833.htm#fr_1265) I. e. speech conveys information on all matters,\nAr _g_ una Mi _s_ ra; p. 264 as the means of acquiring desired fruit, visible\nor invisible, is learnt by speech, Nilaka _nth_ a. Cf. as to all this, B _ri_\nhadara _n_ yaka-upanishad, pp. 50 seq. and 261.\n\n[264:1](sbe0833.htm#fr_1266) I. e. Nilaka _nth_ a says, 'the Brahma _n_ a\nnamed mind,' alluding apparently to [p. 310](sbe0846.htm#page_310) infra. But\nthe reading of some of the MSS., viz. Brahman for the Brahma _n_ a, seems\npreferable, having regard to what follows. Apparently, the Brahma _n_ a's own\nspeech should begin at 'The goddess speech' further on.\n\n[264:2](sbe0833.htm#fr_1267) Nilaka _nth_ a says, immovable = to be understood\nby the external senses; movable = not perceptible by senses, such as heaven,\n&c., which is not quite intelligible. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says, the immovable\nmind is that of the teacher, which is fixed, as it has not to learn or acquire\nanything, while that of the pupil is movable as acquiring new impressions and\nknowledge.\n\n[264:3](sbe0833.htm#fr_1268) I. e. it is the movable mind which takes\ncognisance of the significations of all mantras (sacred texts), letters,\ntones, in which, I presume, sacred instruction is conveyed. To this mind,\nspeech is superior, as that mind only works on what speech places before it;\nbut the mind which is 'with' Pra _g_ apati, is superior to speech as it is not\ndependent on speech like the other.\n\n[264:4](sbe0833.htm#fr_1269) I. e. proudly, about her being the giver of\ndesires to Brahman.\n\n[264:5](sbe0833.htm#fr_1270) I. e., says Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, the words will\nnot come out with the Pra _n_ a life-wind and convey any sense to the hearer,\nbut will be absorbed down into the Apana life-wind, and not be articulated as\nspeech at all. Cf. Kaushitaki, p. 41; Ka _th_ a, p. 184 (with glosses); and\n_Kh_ andogya, p. 42.\n\n[264:6](sbe0833.htm#fr_1271) I. e., I presume, was dependent on the two life-\nwinds named. Cf. [p. 353](sbe0856.htm#page_353) infra. For this sense of the\nword 'between,' see [p. 258](sbe0832.htm#page_258) supra, and _Kh_ andogya-\nupanishad, p. 623.\n\n[265:1](sbe0833.htm#fr_1272) And not with the Pra _n_ a, so as to be\narticulated. Cf. p. 264.\n\n[265:2](sbe0833.htm#fr_1273) I. e. to withdraw the 'curse' pronounced, as\nabove stated.\n\n[265:3](sbe0833.htm#fr_1274) After the curse was withdrawn, says Ar _g_ una Mi\n_s_ ra. Cf. B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p. 317.\n\n[265:4](sbe0833.htm#fr_1275) Since, says Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, noiseless\nspeech is the source of all words--Va _n_ maya. Perhaps we may compare\nAitareya-brahmana (Haug), p. 47.\n\n[265:5](sbe0833.htm#fr_1276) Viz. Va _n_ maya; milk, as a source of pleasure.\n\n[265:6](sbe0833.htm#fr_1277) I. e. enlightening, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra. But,\nperhaps, the translation should be, 'has powers divine and not divine.' As to\nthis, cf. Sa _n_ khya Bhashya on III, 41, and Sa _n_ khyatattvakaumudi, p.\n118, and Wilson's Sankhya Karika, p. 37 (Sanskrit), and _S_ veta _s_ vatara,\np. 284 (gloss).\n\n[265:7](sbe0833.htm#fr_1278) Ar _g_ una Mitra refers to a ' _S_ atapatha text'\nin praise of the subtle speech. I cannot trace the text. But see Nirukta\n(Roth), pp. 167-187.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VII](sbe0834.htm)\n\n"
