When he has taken out the \xc3\x82havaniya fire 1, he performs the Full-\noffering 2. The reason why\n\np. 303\n\nhe performs the full-offering is that he thereby causes that Agni to become an\neater of food for his own self; that he thereby offers food to him. Even as (a\nmother or cow) would offer the breast to a new-born child or calf, so does he\nthereby offer food to him.\n\n2:2:1:22\\. And having been appeased by that food, he (Agni) waits patiently\nfor the other oblations to be cooked. If, on the other hand, that oblation\nwere not to be offered up in him, he would ere long burn either the Adhvaryu\nor the sacrificer, for these two pass nearest by him. This is the reason why\nhe makes this offering.\n\n2:2:1:33\\. He offers it (with a) full (spoon); for the full doubtless means\nthe All (universe), so that he thereby appeases him with the All. He offers it\nwith 'Svaha!' for the Svaha is undefined, and undefined also is the All, so\nthat he thereby appeases him by means of the All.\n\n2:2:1:44\\. The first offering which Pra _g_ apati made, he made with 'Svaha!'\nNow that (offering) indeed is virtually the same as this one; and hence he\n(the sacrificer) also makes it with 'Svaha!' At this (offering) he grants a\nboon (to the priests) 1; but\n\np. 304\n\na boon (may mean) everything, so that he thereby appeases him (Agni) with\neverything.\n\n2:2:1:55\\. Here now they say, 'When he has made this offering, he need not\nattend to the subsequent oblations; for by this offering he obtains that wish\nfor which he takes out the subsequent oblations.'\n\n2:2:1:66\\. He takes out (material for an oblation) 1 to Agni Pavamana (the\nBlowing) 2. Now the blowing one is the breath, so that he thereby puts breath\ninto him (the sacrificer). And this he puts into him by means of this\n(offering); for breath means food, and this offering also is food.\n\np. 305\n\n2:2:1:77\\. He then makes offering to Agni Pavaka (the Purifying). Now the\npurifying one means food, so that he thereby puts food into him (Agni, or the\nsacrificer). And this he puts into him by means of this (offering), for this\noffering is indeed food.\n\n2:2:1:88\\. He then makes offering to Agni _S_ u _k_ i (the Bright). Now\nbrightness means vigour, so that he thereby puts vigour into him. And this he\nputs into him by means of this (offering); for when he offers up that oblation\nin him (Agni), then that vigour, that brightness of his blazes up.\n\n2:2:1:99\\. For this reason they say, 'When he has made that (full) offering,\nhe need not attend to any further oblations; for by this offering he obtains\nthat wish for which he takes out the subsequent oblations.' But let him\nnevertheless take out the subsequent oblations; for what invisible (blessing,\nor meaning) there was in that (full-offering) that now becomes thus (visible).\n\n2:2:1:1010\\. Now the reason why he makes offering to Agni Pavamana, is that\nthe blowing one is the breath. When (the child) is born, then there is breath.\nAnd as long as it is not born, it breathes in accord with the mother's breath;\nbut when it is born, then he thereby puts breath into it.\n\n2:2:1:1111\\. And the reason why he makes offering to Agni Pavaka, is that the\npurifying one means food: hence he thereby puts food into (the child) when it\nis born.\n\n2:2:1:1212\\. And the reason why he makes offering to Agni _S_ u _k_ i, is that\nbrightness means vigour. Now when it (the child) grows by means of food, then\nthere is vigour; and hence, when he has made it grow by means of food, he\nthereby puts into it that vigour, that brightness. This is why (he offers) to\nAgni _S_ u _k_ i.\n\np. 306\n\n2:2:1:1313\\. That other (practice) then is altogether erroneous 1. For when\nAgni passed over from the gods to men, he bethought him, 'I must not pass over\nto men with my whole body!'\n\n2:2:1:1414\\. He then laid down in these (three) worlds those three bodies of\nhis. That 'blowing (pavamana)' form of his he laid down on this earth, that\n'purifying (pavaka)' one in the ether, and that 'bright ( _s_ u _k_ i)' one in\nthe sky. Now the _Ri_ shis then existing became aware of this: 'Agni has not\ncome to us with his whole body,' they said. They then prepared those oblations\nfor him.\n\n2:2:1:1515\\. Now when he makes offering to Agni Pavamana, he thereby obtains\nthat form of his (Agni's) which he laid down on this earth; and when he makes\noffering to Agni Pavaka, he thereby obtains that form of his which he laid\ndown in the ether; and when he makes offering to Agni _S_ u _k_ i, he thereby\nobtains that form of his which he laid down in the sky: and thus he lays down\nthe entire Agni unmutilated. For this reason also he should take out the\noblations subsequent (to the full-offering).\n\n2:2:1:1616\\. The first oblation has a barhis (altar-covering of sacrificial\ngrass) to itself; the two following ones have one barhis in common. Now the\nfirst oblation represents this world, the second one that ether, and the third\none the sky. But this earth is compact; and the ether and yonder sky are, as\nit were, trembling: and in order that these two may counterbalance that\n(earth), the (last) two (oblations) have one barhis in common.\n\np. 307\n\n2:2:1:1717\\. All these sacrificial cakes (for Agni) are on eight potsherds;\nfor of eight syllables consists the (pada of the) gayatri, and the gayatri is\nAgni's metre 1: with its own metre he accordingly establishes that fire. In\nall, these potsherds amount to twenty-four; for of twenty-four syllables\nconsists the gayatri (stanza), and the gayatri is Agni's metre: with its own\nmetre he accordingly establishes that fire.\n\n2:2:1:1818\\. He then offers a potful of boiled rice to Aditi. For he who\nperforms those (preceding) oblations moves away, as it were, from this world,\nsince he moves in the ascent of these worlds 2.\n\n2:2:1:1919\\. Now when he offers a potful of boiled rice to Aditi,--Aditi being\nthis earth, and this earth being a firm resting-place,--he thereby again takes\nhis stand on this firm resting-place. This is why he offers a potful of boiled\nrice to Aditi.\n\n2:2:1:2020\\. For her, they say, the two sa _m_ ya _g_ yas 3 should be vira _g_\nverses; for the vira _g_ is this (earth); or\n\np. 308\n\ntrish _t_ ubh verses, for the trish _t_ ubh is this (earth); or _g_ agati\nverses, for the _g_ agati is this (earth). Still, however, they should be vira\n_g_ verses.\n\n2:2:1:2121\\. The priests' fee for (offering to) her consists of a cow; for\nthis (earth) is, as it were, a cow: she milks out for men all their desires.\nThe cow is a mother, and this (earth) also is a mother, for she bears the men:\nfor this reason the priests' fee is a cow. This is one mode (of performing\nthose offerings).\n\n2:2:1:2222\\. Then there is this other. He simply offers a cake on eight\npotsherds to Agni, and thereby, implicitly, to Agni Pavamana, Agni Pavaka, and\nAgni _S_ u _k_ i; and immediately after he visibly sets him up (as Agni). For\nthis reason he offers (a cake) to Agni 1, and then a potful of boiled rice to\nAditi. The treatment of the potful of rice (in that case) is the same (as\nbefore).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[302:1](sbe1244.htm#fr_694) Previously to the performance of the full-\noffering, the other fires (if there are any more) are laid down. An integral\npart of the laying down of the Sabhya, or hall-fire, which seems to have been\nkept up only by Kshatriyas, is a game of dice, played by the priests, with a\ncow, offered by the sacrificer, for the stake. On an ox-hide, spread north of\nthe sacrificial ground, they place a brass vessel upside down, and on it throw\nfour times five cowries (or, if such are not to be had, five sticks) with\n'Even I win, uneven thou art won (or defeated)!'\n\n[302:2](sbe1244.htm#fr_695) The pur _n_ ahuti, or 'full-offering,' is an\noblation of a spoonful of clarified butter. Katy. IV. 10, 5, and comm., supply\nthe following particulars, applying to all ordinary _g_ uhoti-offerings: He\nputs butter into the butter-pot and places it on the Garhapatya to p. 303\nmelt. Having then wiped the dipping-spoon (sruva) and offering-spoon ( _g_\nuhu) with sacrificial grass in the manner described at I, 3, 1, 6 seq., and\ntaken the butter-pot off the fire, and strained the butter with the two stalks\nof darbha serving as strainers, he fills the _g_ uhu with the sruva. He now\ntakes one stick, steps over to the north side of the \xc3\x82havaniya fire, strews\ngrass around it, and puts the stick on the fire. He then sits down with bent\nright knee, and, while the sacrificer takes hold of him from behind, he pours\nthe spoonful of butter into the fire with 'Svaha!' the sacrificer pronouncing\nthe dedicatory formula (tyaga), 'This to Agni!'\n\n[303:1](sbe1244.htm#fr_696) After the full-offering the sacrificer breaks the\nsilence, imposed on him, by the words, 'I give a boon,' Katy. IV, 10, 6;\npresents, p. 304 according to the commentary, being then made to the Adhvaryu\nand the Brahman. This ceremony is succeeded by the silent performance of the\nAgnihotra.\n\n[304:1](sbe1244.htm#fr_697) The pur _n_ ahuti, which marks the close of the\nAgnyadheya proper, is followed by the Agnihotra, performed with the texts\npronounced in a low voice. Not less than twelve days after the Agnyadheya (if\nat all)--the three fires being kept up during the interval--the young\nhouseholder has to get performed for him (on the model of the new and full-\nmoon offering, mutatis mutandis, there being neither the uddhara _n_ a, or\ntaking out of fire from the Garhapatya, nor the choosing of a Brahman, &c.)\nthe three ish _t_ is mentioned above. At the first ish _t_ i, the special\nhavis (sacrificial dish) consists of a rice-cake on eight potsherds for Agni\nPavamana;--at the second of two such cakes for Agni Pavaka and Agni Su _k_ i\nrespectively;--at the third of a potful of boiled rice for Aditi. The three\nhavis of the first two ish _t_ is being (according to Taitt. Br. I, 1, 6, 3)\nconsidered as representing the three bodies (tanu) of Agni; these offerings\nare called tanuhavir-ish _t_ is. They are, however, also called Pavamanesh _t_\nis. At these the name of the recipient (Agni Pavamana, &c.) has to be\npronounced in a low voice in the formulas used at the chief offering. The\nTaitt. Br. mentions, besides, the usual Indragni cake (of the new-moon\nsacrifice) which is to be offered before the offering to Aditi.\n\n[304:2](sbe1244.htm#fr_698) Saya _n_ a, on Taitt. Br. I, 1, 5, 10, takes\npavamana as 'pure' or 'purified by himself' (svaya _m_ _s_ riddha); pavaka as\n'purifying (others);' and _s_ u _k_ i as 'shining.'\n\n[306:1](sbe1244.htm#fr_699) Viz. the practice of performing the full-offering\nonly, see par. 5. The Ka _n_ va text reads: Tad va etat samanam eva sad\nviparyastam iva.\n\n[307:1](sbe1244.htm#fr_700) The Ka _n_ va text remarks that the anuvakyas\n(invitatory prayers) and ya _g_ yas (offering prayers) at the three offerings\nof cake are in the gayatri metre; and such indeed is the case. The anuvakyas\nof the oblations to Agni Pavamana, Agni Pavaka, and Agni _S_ u _k_ i are Rig-\nveda IX, 66, 19; I, 12, 10; and VIII, 44, 21 respectively: and the ya _g_ yas\nare IX, 66, 21; V, 26, 1; and VIII, 44, 17 respectively; all of which are\ngayatri stanzas. See \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_ r. II, 1, 20-25. Cf. also I, 7, 2, 15, with\nnote. At the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t of these two ish _t_ is also both formulas\nare in the gayatri metre: the puro'nuvakyas being Rig-veda III, 11, 2, and\nIII, 11, 6; and the ya _g_ yas III, 11, 1, and I, 1, 1 respectively.\n\n[307:2](sbe1244.htm#fr_701) Pra _k_ yavata iva va esho 'smal lokat . . . iman\nhi lokan samarohann eti. The Ka _n_ va text has: 'For he who takes out these\noblations makes his self, as it were, depart from this world of men for the\nworld of the gods, since he, as it were, moves rising upwards (urdhva iva hi\nsamarohann eti).' Cf. paragraphs 14-16.\n\n[307:3](sbe1244.htm#fr_702) For these (vira _g_ ) sa _m_ ya _g_ ye, or\ninvitatory and offering prayers at the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t, see [p.\n164](sbe1227.htm#page_164), note [2](sbe1228.htm#fn_381).--\xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_ r. II,\n1, 29.\n\n[308:1](sbe1244.htm#fr_703) According to the Ka _n_ va recension, the anuvakya\nand ya _g_ ya, in that case, should consist of the verses containing the word\nmurdhan ('head'), viz. Va _g_. S. XIII, 14, 15; cf. _S_ at. Br. I, 6, 2, 12.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 2. Second Brahma _n_ a](sbe1245.htm)\n\n"
