XVI.\n\nKe\xc5\x9bin, in the form of a horse, slain by Krishn\xcc\x81a: he is praised by Narada.\n\nKE\xc5\x9aIN, confiding in his prowess, having received the commands of Kansa, set\noff to the woods of Vrindavana, with the intention of destroying Krishn\xcc\x81a. He\ncame in the shape of a steed, spurning the earth with his hoofs, scattering\nthe clouds with his mane, and springing in his paces beyond the orbits of the\nsun and moon. The cowherds and their females, hearing his neighings, were\nstruck with terror, and fled to Govinda for protection, calling upon him to\nsave them. In a voice deep as the roaring of the thundercloud, Krishn\xcc\x81a\nreplied to them, "Away with these fears of Ke\xc5\x9bin; is the valour of a hero\nannihilated by your alarms? What is there to apprehend from one of such little\nmight, whose neighings are his only terrors; a galloping and vicious steed,\nwho is ridden by the strength of the Daityas? Come on, wretch--I am Krishn\xcc\x81a--\nand I will knock all thy teeth down thy throat, as the wielder of the trident\ndid to Pushan 1." Thus defying him to combat, Govinda went to encounter Ke\xc5\x9bin.\nThe demon ran upon him, with his mouth opened wide; but Krishn\xcc\x81a enlarging the\nbulk of his arm, thrust it into his mouth, and wrenched out the teeth, which\nfell from his jaws like fragments of white clouds. Still the arm of Krishn\xcc\x81a,\nin the throat of the demon, continued to enlarge, like a malady increasing\nfrom its commencement till it ends in dissolution. From his torn lips the\ndemon vomited foam and blood; his eyes rolled in agony; his joints gave way;\nhe beat the earth with his feet; his body was covered with perspiration; he\nbecame incapable of any effort. The formidable demon, having his mouth rent\nopen by the arm of Krishn\xcc\x81a, fell down, torn asunder like a tree struck by\nlightning: he lay separated into two portions, each having two legs, half a\nback, half a tail, one ear, one eye, and one nostril. Krishn\xcc\x81a stood, unharmed\nand smiling, after the destruction of the demon, surrounded by the cowherds,\nwho, together with their women, were filled with astonishment at\n\np. 540\n\nthe death of Ke\xc5\x9bin, and glorified the amiable god with the lotus eyes. Narada\nthe Brahman, invisible, seated in a cloud, beheld the fall of Ke\xc5\x9bin, and\ndelightedly exclaimed, "Well done, lord of the universe, who in thy sports\nhast destroyed Ke\xc5\x9bin, the oppressor of the denizens of heaven! Curious to\nbehold this great combat between a man and a horse--such a one as was never\nbefore heard of--I have come from heaven. Wonderful are the works that thou\nhast done, in thy descent upon the earth! they have excited my astonishment;\nbut this, above all, has given me pleasure. Indra and the gods lived in dread\nof this horse, who tossed his mane, and neighed, and looked down upon the\nclouds. For this, that thou hast slain the impious Ke\xc5\x9bin, thou shalt be known\nin the world by the name of Ke\xc5\x9bava 2. Farewell: I will now depart. I shall\nmeet thee again, conqueror of Ke\xc5\x9bin, in two days more, in conflict with Kansa.\nWhen the son of Ugrasena, with his followers, shall have been slain, then,\nupholder of the earth, will earth\'s burdens have been lightened by thee. Many\nare the battles of the kings that I have to see, in which thou shalt be\nrenowned. I will now depart, Govinda. A great deed, and acceptable to the\ngods, has been done by thee. I have been much delighted with thee, and now\ntake my leave." When Narada had gone, Krishn\xcc\x81a, not in any way surprised,\nreturned with the Gopas to Gokula; the sole object of the eyes of the women of\nVraja 3.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[539:1](vp133.htm#fr_1499) As Virabhadra did to Pusha or Pushan, a form of\nSurya, at the sacrifice of Daksha: see [p. 67](vp043.htm#page_67). n.\n[6](vp043.htm#fn_226).\n\n[540:2](vp133.htm#fr_1500) Or Ke\xc5\x9bi and va, \'who kills,\' from vadh or badh, \'to\nkill:\' but this is a Pauran\xcc\x81ik etymology, and less satisfactory than the usual\ngrammatical one of Ke\xc5\x9ba, \'hair,\' and \'va\' possessive affix: Krishn\xcc\x81a\ncorresponding in this respect to the Apollo Crinitus. It is also derived from\nthe legend of his origin from \'a hair\' (see [p. 497](vp118.htm#page_497). n.\n[23](vp118.htm#fn_1460)): and again, Ke\xc5\x9ba is said to purport \'radiance\' or\n\'rays,\' whether of the sun or moon or fire; all which are the light of\nKrishn\xcc\x81a: whence he is called Ke\xc5\x9bava, \'the rayed\' or \'radiant.\' Mahabharata,\nMoksha Dharma.\n\n[540:3](vp133.htm#fr_1501) The legend is told by all the other narrators of\nKrishn\xcc\x81a\'s juvenile exploits.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XVII](vp134.htm)\n\n'
