Narada said :-- O Naraya _n_ a! O Thou, the Supporter of this whole\nworld! The Preserver of all! Thou hast described the glorious characters of\nthe Devi, that take away all the sins. Kindly describe now to me the several\nforms that the Devi assumed in every Manvantara in this world as well as Her\nDivine Greatness. O Thou, full of mercy! Describe also how and by whom She was\nworshipped and praised; how She, so kind to the devotees, having been thus\npleased, fulfilled their desires. I am very eager to hear these, the very best\nand blissful characters of the Devi. S\xc2\x92ri Naraya _n_ a said :-- Hear, O Mahar\n_s_ i! The glories and greatness of the Devi Bhagavati leading to the devotion\nof the devotees, capable of giving all sorts of wealth and destroying all\nsins. From the navel lotus of Vi _sn_ u, the holder of the Chakra (discus),\nwas born Brahma, the Creator of this universe, the great Energetic One, and\nthe Grand Sire of all the worlds.\n\n\n\n7-14. The four faced Brahma, on being born, produced from His mind Svayambhuva\nManu and his wife S\xc2\x92atarupa, the embodiment of all virtues. For this very\nreason, Svayambbuva Manu has been known as the mind-born son of Brahma.\nSvayambhuva Manu got from Brahma the task to create and multiply; he made an\nearthen image of the Devi Bhagavati, the Bestower of all fortunes, on the\nbeach of the sanctifying K _s_ ira Samudra (ocean of milk) and he engaged\nhimself in worshipping Her and began to repeat the principal mystic mantra of\nVagbhava (the Deity of Speech). Thus engaged in worship, Svayambhuva Manu\nconquered by and by his breath and food and observed Yama, Niyama and other\nvows and became lean and thin. For one hundred years he remained standing\nalways on one leg and became successful in controlling his six passions lust,\nanger, etc. He meditated on the feet of that \xc3\x82dya S'akti (the Primordial\nS'akti) so much that he became inert like a vegetable or mineral matter. By\nhis Tapas the Devi, the World Mother appeared before him and said :-- \xc2\x93O King!\nAsk divine boons from Me.\xc2\x94 Hearing these joyous words, the King wanted his\nlong cherished and heart-felt boon, so very rare to the Devas.\n\n\n\n15-22. Manu said :-- O Large eyed Devi! Victory to Thee, residing in the\nhearts of all! O Thou honoured, worshipped! O Thou! the Upholdress of the\nworld! O Thou, the Auspicious of all auspicious!\n\n\n\np. 1023\n\n\n\nBy Thy Gracious Look, it is that the Lotus born has been able to create the\nworlds; Vi _sn_ u is perserving and Rudra Deva is destroying in a minute. By\nThy command it is that Indra, the Lord of S'achi, has got the charge of\ncontrolling the three Lokas; and Yama, the Lord of the departed, is awarding\nfruits and punishing according, to their merits or demerits, the deceased\nones. O Mother! By Thy Grace, Varu _n_ a, the holder of the noose, has become\nthe lord of all aquatic creatures and is preserving them; and Kuvera, the lord\nof the Yak _s_ as, has become the lord of wealth. Agni (fire), Nai _rr_ it,\nVayu (wind), \xc3\x8es'ana and Ananta Deva are Thy parts and have grown by Thy power.\nThen, O Devi! If Thou desirest to grant me my desired boon, then, O Thou! the\nAuspicious One! Let all the great obstacles to my work of procreating in this\nuniverse and increasing my dominions die away. And if anybody worships this\ngreat Vagbhava Mantra or anybody hears with devotion this history or makes\nothers hear this, they all shall be crowned with success and enjoyment and\nMukti be easy to them.\n\n\n\n23-24. Specially they would get the power to remember their past lives,\nacquire eloquence in speaking, all round beauty, success in obtaining\nknowledge, success in their deeds and especially in the increase of their\nposterity and children. O Bhagavati! This is what I want most.\n\n\n\nHere ends the First Chapter of the Tenth Book on the story of Svayambhuva Manu\nin the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_\ni Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 2](bk10ch02.htm)\n\n"
