It contains all rare, difficult, and doubtful\nwords, all words of any mythological importance, and especially all words\nabout which something is said in the Notes.\n\nThree figures refer to Ma _n_ _d_ ala, hymn, and verse, a small figure to a\nnote. If a word occurs in a note only, the passage is put in parentheses.\n\nM. W.  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: A](sbe46134.htm)\n\n'
