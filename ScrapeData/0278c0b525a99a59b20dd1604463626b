Pra _g_ apati desired, 'Would that I obtained all my desires!\nwould that I attained all attainments!' He beheld this three days' Soma-\nsacrifice, the A _s_ vamedha, and took possession of it, and sacrificed with\nit: by sacrificing therewith he obtained all his desires, and attained all\nattainments; and, verily, whosoever performs the A _s_ vamedha sacrifice\nobtains all his desires, and attains all attainments.\n\n13:4:1:22\\. Concerning this they say, 'In what season is the beginning (to be\nmade)?'--'Let him begin it in summer,' say some, 'for summer is the\nKshatriya's season, and truly this--to wit, the A _s_ vamedha--is the\nKshatriya's sacrifice.'\n\n13:4:1:33\\. But let him rather begin it in spring; for\n\np. 348\n\nspring is the Brahma _n_ a's season, and truly whosoever sacrifices,\nsacrifices after becoming, as it were, a Brahma _n_ a: let him therefore by\nall means begin it in spring.\n\n13:4:1:44\\. And six days, or seven days, before that full-moon of Phalguna,\nthe officiating priests meet together--to wit, the Adhvaryu, the Hot _ri_ ,\nthe Brahman, and the Udgat _ri_ ; for under these 1 the other priests are.\n\n13:4:1:55\\. The Adhvaryu prepares for them a priest's mess of rice sufficient\nfor four persons: the meaning of this has been explained 2. Four bowlfuls,\nfour double handfuls, four handfuls: twelvefold this is--twelve months are a\nyear, and the year is everything, and the A _s_ vamedha is everything--thus it\nis in order to his gaining and securing everything.\n\n13:4:1:66\\. Those four priests eat it: the meaning of this has been explained.\nHe (the Sacrificer) gives to them four thousand (cows) in order to his gaining\nand securing everything, for a thousand means everything, and the A _s_\nvamedha is everything. And (he gives them) four gold plates weighing a hundred\n(grains): the meaning of this has been explained 3.\n\n13:4:1:77\\. The Adhvaryu then, hanging a gold ornament (nishka) round him,\nmakes him mutter (Va _g_. S. XXII, 1), 'Fire thou art, light and immortality,'\n--for gold, indeed, is fire, light 4, and\n\np. 349\n\nimmortality: fire (fiery mettle), light (brilliance), and immortality he thus\nbestows upon him;--'protector of life, protect my life!' he thereby bestows\nlife (vital strength) upon him. With a view to commencing the sacrifice, he\nthen says to him, 'Restrain thy speech!' for the sacrifice is speech.\n\n13:4:1:88\\. Four (of the king's) wives are in attendance--the consecrated\nqueen, the favourite wife, a discarded wife, and the Palagali 1, all of them\nadorned and wearing gold ornaments (neck-plates)--with the view of the\ncompleteness of conjugal union. With them he enters the hall of the\nsacrificial fires--the Sacrificer by the eastern, the wives by the southern,\ndoor.\n\n13:4:1:99\\. When the evening-offering 2 has been performed, he lies down with\nhis favourite wife behind the Garhapatya hearth, with his head towards the\nnorth. At the same place 3 the other (wives) also lie down. He lies in her lap\nwithout embracing her 4, thinking, 'May I, by this self-restraint, reach\nsuccessfully the end of the year!'\n\n13:4:1:1010\\. When the morning offering has been performed, the Adhvaryu\nperforms a full-offering 5 with a view to his (the Sacrificer's) gaining and\nsecuring everything, for the full means everything, and the A _s_ vamedha is\neverything. At this (offering) he releases speech by (bestowing) a boon,\n\np. 350\n\nsaying, 'I grant a boon to the Brahman (priest):' (this he does) with a view\nto his gaining and securing everything, for a boon is everything, and the A\n_s_ vamedha is everything.\n\n13:4:1:1111\\. The gold ornament which is attached to his (neck) he then gives\nto the Adhvaryu: in giving it to the Adhvaryu he secures to himself immortal\nlife, for gold means immortal life.\n\n13:4:1:1212\\. For the object of (gaining) the road, and in order not to lose\nthe mouth (mukha) of the sacrifice, he then prepares an ish _t_ i-offering 1\nto Agni. For, indeed, all the deities have Agni for their mouth, and in the A\n_s_ vamedha are (contained) all objects of desire: 'Having, at the outset\n(mukha _t_ a _h_ ), gratified all the gods, may I obtain all my desires!' so\nhe thinks.\n\n13:4:1:1313\\. For this (offering) there are fifteen kindling-verses 2; for\nfifteenfold is the thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt means vigour: with the\nthunderbolt (of) vigour the Sacrificer thus from the first repels evil. The\ntwo butter-portions relate to the slaying of V _ri_ tra 3, with a view to the\nrepelling of evil, for\n\np. 351\n\n[paragraph continues] V _ri_ tra is evil. [The verses, Va _g_. S. XIII, 14,\n15,] 'Agni, the head, the summit of the sky . . . 1,' and 'Be thou the leader\nof the sacrifice and the realm of space (whither thou strivest with auspicious\nteams: thy light-winning head hast thou raised to the sky, and thy tongue, O\nAgni, hast thou made the bearer of the offering),' pronounced in a low voice,\nare the anuvakya and ya _g_ ya of the chief oblation. The one contains (the\nword) 'head,' the other (the verb) 'to be,'--for the head, assuredly, is he\nthat shines yonder: thus it is in order to secure him (the Sun); and as to why\n(the other) contains (the verb) 'to be,'--he thereby secures that which is\n(the real, truly existent). The Sa _m_ ya _g_ yas 2 are two vira _g_ -verses\n3; for that--to wit, the Vira _g_ \\--is the metre\n\np. 352\n\nbelonging to all the gods, and all objects of desire are (contained) in the A\n_s_ vamedha: 'Having gratified all the gods, may I obtain all my desires!' so\nhe thinks. The sacrificial fee is gold weighing a hundred (grains): the\nmeaning of this has been explained.\n\n13:4:1:1414\\. He then prepares a (pap) for Pushan, for Pushan is the overlord\nof roads: he thus secures successful progress to the horse. But Pushan is also\nthis (earth): he thus makes this (earth) its guardian, for neither injury nor\nfailure befals him whom this (earth) guards on the way; and this (earth) he\nthus makes its guardian.\n\n13:4:1:1515\\. For this (offering) there are seventeen kindling-verses 1, for\nthe obtainment of the A _s_ vamedha, for Pra _g_ apati is seventeenfold, and\nthe A _s_ vamedha is Pra _g_ apati. The two butter-portions are possessed of\n'growth 2,' even for the growth of the Sacrificer. [The verses, Va _g_. S.\nXXXIV, 41, 42,] 'Pushan, in thy sway we [shall never suffer harm, we (who)\nhere are singers of thy praises],' and 'The hymn (?) lovingly composed by\ndesire of praise hath reached\n\np. 353\n\nthe guardian of every path: (may he, Pushan, grant unto us draughts of light\n(?), and fulfil our every prayer!'), pronounced in a low voice, are the\nanuvakya and ya _g_ ya of the chief oblation. The one contains (the word)\n'sway,' the other (the word) 'path'; for sway is vigour: (thus it is) in order\nto his gaining and securing vigour; and as to why (the other) contains (the\nword) 'path,' he thereby secures successful progress to the horse. The\ninvitatory and offering formulas of the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t are two anush _t_\nubh verses [1](sbe44103.htm#fn_904); for the Anush _t_ ubh is speech, and Pra\n_g_ apati is speech, and the A _s_ vamedha is Pra _g_ apati: thus it is for\nthe obtainment of the A _s_ vamedha. The priests' fee consists of a hundred\ngarments, for that--to wit, the garment--is man's outward appearance, whence\npeople (on seeing) Any well-clad man, ask, 'Who can this be? for he is perfect\nin his outward appearance: with outward appearance he thus endows him. There\nare a hundred of them, for man has a life of a hundred (years), and a hundred\nenergies: life, and energy, vigour, he thus gains for himself.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[348:1](sbe44102.htm#fr_891) Or, along with these, included in them (are the\nassistant priests).\n\n[348:2](sbe44102.htm#fr_892) See [XIII; 1, 1, 1](sbe44074.htm#13:1:1:1);\n[4](sbe44074.htm#13:1:1:4) (cf.

II, 1, 1, 5; [XIII, 1, 1,\n4](sbe44074.htm#13:1:1:4).\n\n[349:1](sbe44102.htm#fr_895) See [p. 323](sbe44090.htm#page_323), note\n[2](sbe44090.htm#fn_823).\n\n[349:2](sbe44102.htm#fr_896) That is the evening performance of the Agnihotra.\n\n[349:3](sbe44102.htm#fr_897) Tad eva tatraiva, comm.\n\n[349:4](sbe44102.htm#fr_898) So\xe0\xa4\xbdntaroru asa _m_ vartamana _h_ _s_ ete.\n\n[349:5](sbe44102.htm#fr_899) For particulars regarding the 'pur _n_ ahuti,' or\noblation of a spoonful of ghee, see part i, p. 302, note 2.\n\n[350:1](sbe44102.htm#fr_900) Viz. a cake (on eight kapalas) to Agni Pathik\n_ri_ t, 'the path-maker'--or, according to \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_ r. X, 6, 3, to Agni\nMurdhanvat ('forming the head,' so called from the formulas used containing\nthe word 'head).' For a similar special offering to the same deity see [XII,\n4, 4, 1](sbe44061.htm#12:4:4:1) (cf. [XI, 1, 5, 5](sbe44007.htm#11:1:5:5)).\n\n[350:2](sbe44102.htm#fr_901) See part i, p. 95 seqq. (especially I, 3, 5,\n5-7).\n\n[350:3](sbe44102.htm#fr_902) The two \xc3\x82 _g_ yabhagas, or butter-portions to\nAgni and Soma, are said to be 'V _ri_ tra-slaying' (vartraghna), or to relate\nto the slaying of V _ri_ tra, when their anuvakyas, or invitatory formulas,\nare the two verses _Ri_ g-veda VI, 16, 34 (agnir v _ri_ tra _n_ i ga\xe1\xb9\x85ghanat,\n'May Agni slay the V _ri_ tras'), and I, 91, 5 (tva _m_ so _m_ asi satpatis\ntva _m_ ra _g_ ota v _ri_ traha, 'Thou, O Soma, art the true lord, thou art\nthe king and the slayer of V _ri_ tra,' &c.). This is the case at the Full-\nmoon sacrifice, whilst at the New-moon sacrifice the two butter-portions p.\n351 are said to be 'v _ri_ dhanvant,' or 'relating to growth,' because the\nanuvakyas used on that occasion are two verses containing forms of the root v\n_ri_ dh, 'to grow,' viz. VIII, 44, 12 (agni _h_ pratnena manmana . . . kavir\nvipre _n_ a vav _ri_ dhe, 'Agni has grown strong by the old hymn,--as the wise\none by the priest') and I, 91, 11 (Soma girbhish _t_ va vaya _m_ vardhayamo va\n_k_ ovida _h_ . . ., 'O Soma, we magnify thee (make thee grow) by our songs,\nskilful in speech'). In the same way the one or the other form is used in\ndifferent ish _t_ is. At I, 6, 2, 12, the translation, 'the two butter-\nportions should be offered to the V _ri_ tra-slayer (Indra)' should therefore\nbe altered to 'the two butter-portions relate to the slaying of V _ri_ tra'\n(or, 'are V _ri_ tra-slaying').\n\n[351:1](sbe44102.htm#fr_903) See VII, 4, 1, 41.\n\n[351:2](sbe44102.htm#fr_904) That is, the two formulas used with the oblation\nto Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t.\n\n[351:3](sbe44102.htm#fr_905) Whilst the normal performance of an ish _t_ i\nrequires two trish _t_ ubh-verses ( _Ri_ g-veda X, 2, I; VI, 15, 14; cf. part\ni, p. 202, notes 2 and 3) for the invitatory and offering formulas of the\noblations to Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t, two vira _g_ -verses are frequently\nprescribed, certain verses of the Vira _g_ -hymn _Ri_ g-veda VII, 1, being\nchiefly used for this purpose; e. g. v. 3 as the anuvakya, and v. 18 as the ya\n_g_ ya for the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t of the oblation to Aditi at the p. 352\n\xc3\x82dhana (see part i, p. 307, note 3). and the Diksha _n_ iyesh _t_ i; and vv.\n14, 15 as ya _g_ ya and anuvakya of the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t of the Praya _n_\niyesh _t_ i. It is doubtless the two former verses, commonly employed at\nspecial ish _t_ is (cf. part i, p. 164, note 3), which are to be used on the\npresent occasion.\n\n[352:1](sbe44102.htm#fr_906) See part i, p. 112, note 1.\n\n[352:2](sbe44102.htm#fr_907) That is, they are performed with two invitatory\nformulas containing the verb 'to grow,' see p. 350, note 3. Whilst our Brahma\n_n_ a thus prescribes the two invitatory formulas used for the butter-portions\nof the New-moon sacrifice, \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana ( _S_ r. X, 6, 6) prescribes two\nverses containing the verb 'as' (or 'bhu'), viz. _Ri_ g-veda V, 13, 4, tvam\nagne sapratha asi; and I, 92, 9, soma yas to mayobhuva utaya _h_ santi da _s_\nushe tabhir no\xe0\xa4\xbdvita bhava.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 4, 2.
