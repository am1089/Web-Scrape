Well, I must go in and wake her. [ _She walks\nabout. Vasantasen \xc4\x81 appears, dressed, but still asleep. The maid discovers\nher_.] It is time to get up, mistress. The morning is here.\n\nVasantasen\xc4\x81. [ _Awakening_.] What! is the night over? is it morning?\n\n_Maid_. For us it is morning. But for my mistress it appears to be night\nstill.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. But girl, where is your gambler?\n\n_Maid_. Mistress, after giving Vardham\xc4\x81naka his orders, Ch\xc4\x81rudatta went to the\nold garden Pushpakaranda.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. What orders?\n\n_Maid_. To have the bullock-cart ready before daylight; for, he said,\nVasantasen\xc4\x81 was to come\xc2\x97\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Where, girl?\n\n_Maid_. Where Ch\xc4\x81rudatta is.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _Embraces the maid_.] I did not have a good look at him in\nthe evening. But to-day I shall see him face to face. Tell me, girl. Have I\nfound my way into the inner court?\n\n_Maid_. You have found your way not only into the inner court, but into the\nheart of every one who lives here.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Tell me, are Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\'s servants vexed?\n\n_Maid_. They will be.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. When?\n\n_Maid_. When my mistress goes away.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. But not so much as I shall be. [ _Persuasively_.] Here,\n\np. 94\n\ngirl, take this pearl necklace. You must go and give it to my lady sister, his\ngood wife. And give her this message: "Worthy Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\'s virtues have won\nme, made me his slave, and therefore your slave also. And so I hope that these\npearls may adorn your neck."\n\n_Maid_. But mistress, Ch\xc4\x81rudatta will be angry with you.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Go. He will not be angry.\n\n_Maid_. [ _Takes the necklace_.] Yes, mistress. [ _She goes out, then\nreturns_.] Mistress, his lady wife says that her lord made you a present of\nit, and it would not be right for her to accept it. And further, that you are\nto know that her lord and husband is her most excellent adornment.\n\n[ _Enter Radanik \xc4\x81, with Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\'s little son_.]\n\n_Radanik \xc4\x81_. Come, dear, let\'s play with your little cart.\n\n_Rohasena_. [ _Peevishly_.] I don\'t like this little clay cart, Radanik\xc4\x81. Give\nme my gold cart.\n\n_Radanik \xc4\x81_. [ _Sighing wearily_.] How should we have anything to do with gold\nnow, my child? When your papa is rich again, then you shall have a gold cart\nto play with. But I\'ll amuse him by taking him to see Vasantasen\xc4\x81. [ _She\napproaches Vasantasen \xc4\x81_.] Mistress, my service to you.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. I am glad to see you, Radanik\xc4\x81. But whose little boy is this?\nHe wears no ornaments, yet his dear little face makes my heart happy.\n\n_Radanik \xc4\x81_. This is Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\'s son, Rohasena.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _Stretches out her arms_.] Come, my boy, and put your little\narms around me. [ _She takes him on her lap_.] He looks just like his father.\n\n_Radanik \xc4\x81_. More than looks like him, he is like him. At least I think so.\nHis father is perfectly devoted to him.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. But what is he crying about?\n\n_Radanik \xc4\x81_. He used to play with a gold cart that belongs to the son of a\nneighbor. But that was taken away, and when he asked\n\np. 95\n\nfor it, I made him this little clay cart. But when I gave it to him, he said\n"I don\'t like this little clay cart, Radanik\xc4\x81. Give me my gold cart."\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Oh, dear! To think that this little fellow has to suffer\nbecause others are wealthy. Ah, mighty Fate! the destinies of men, uncertain\nas the water-drops which fall upon a lotus-leaf, seem to thee but playthings!\n[ _Tearfully_.] Don\'t cry, my child. You shall have a gold cart to play with.\n\n_Rohasena_. Who is she, Radanik\xc4\x81?\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. A slave of your father\'s, won by his virtues.\n\n_Radanik \xc4\x81_. My child, the lady is your mother.\n\n_Rohasena_. That\'s a lie, Radanik\xc4\x81. If the lady is my mother, why does she\nwear those pretty ornaments?\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. My child, your innocent lips can say terrible things. [ _She\nremoves her ornaments. Weeping_.] Now I am your mother. You shall take these\nornaments and have a gold cart made for you.\n\n_Rohasena_. Go away! I won\'t take them. You\'re crying.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _Wiping away her tears_.] I\'ll not cry, dear. There! go and\nplay. [ _She fills the clay cart with her jewels_.] There, dear, you must have\na little gold cart made for you.\n\n[ _Exit Radanik \xc4\x81, with Rohasena_.\n\n[ _Enter Vardham \xc4\x81naka, driving a bullock-cart_.]\n\n_Vardham \xc4\x81naka_. Radanik\xc4\x81, Radanik\xc4\x81! Tell mistress Vasantasen\xc4\x81 that the\ncovered cart is standing ready at the side-door.\n\n_Radanik \xc4\x81_. [ _Entering_.] Mistress, Vardham\xc4\x81naka is here, and he says that\nthe cart is waiting at the side-door.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. He must wait a minute, girl, while I get ready.\n\n_Rad_. Wait a minute, Vardham\xc4\x81naka, while she gets ready.\n\n[ _Exit_.\n\n_Vardham \xc4\x81naka_. Hello, I\'ve forgotten the cushion. I must go and get it. But\nthe nose-rope makes the bullocks skittish. I suppose I had better take the\ncart along with me.\n\n[ _Exit_.\n\np. 96\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Bring me my things, girl. I must make myself ready. [ _She\ndoes so_.]\n\n\n\n[ _Enter, driving a bullock-cart, Sth \xc4\x81varaka, servant to Sansth\xc4\x81naka_.]\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. Sansth\xc4\x81naka, the king\'s brother-in-law, said to me "Take a\nbullock-cart, Sth\xc4\x81varaka, and come as quick as you can to the old garden\nPushpakaranda." Well, I\'m on my way there. Get up, bullocks, get up! [ _He\ndrives about and looks around_.] Why, the road is blocked with villagers\'\ncarts. What am I to do now? [ _Haughtily_.] Get out of my way, you! Get out of\nmy way! [ _He listens_.] What\'s that? you want to know whose cart this is?\nThis cart belongs to Sansth\xc4\x81naka, the king\'s brother-in-law. So get out of my\nway\xc2\x97and this minute, too! [ _He looks about_.] Why, here\'s a man going in the\nother direction as fast as he can. He is trying to hide like a runaway\ngambler, and he looks at me as if I were the gambling-master. I wonder who he\nis. But then, what business is it of mine? I must get there as soon as I can.\nGet out of my way, you villagers, get out of my way! What\'s that? you want me\nto wait a minute and put a shoulder to your wheel? Confound you! A brave man\nlike me, that serves Sansth\xc4\x81naka, the king\'s brother-in-law, put a shoulder to\nyour wheel? After all, the poor fellow is quite alone. I\'ll do it. I\'ll stop\nmy cart at the side-door to Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\'s orchard. [ _He does so_.] I\'m coming!\n\n[ _Exit_.\n\n_Maid_. Mistress, I think I hear the sound of wheels. The cart must be here.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Come, girl. My heart grows impatient. Go with me to the side-\ndoor.\n\n_Maid_. Follow me, mistress.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _Walks about_.] You have earned a rest, girl.\n\n_Maid_. Thank you, mistress.\n\n[ _Exit_.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _Feels her right eye twitch_  1 _as she enters the cart_.]\n\np. 97\n\nWhy should my right eye twitch now? But the sight of Ch\xc4\x81rudatta will smooth\naway the bad omen.\n\n[ _Enter Sth \xc4\x81varaka_.]\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. I\'ve cleared the carts out of the way, and now I\'ll go ahead. [\n_He mounts and drives away. To himself_.] The cart has grown heavy. But I\nsuppose it only seems so, because I got tired helping them with that wheel.\nWell, I\'ll go along. Get up, bullocks, get up!\n\n_A voice behind the scenes_. Police! Police! Every man at his post! The young\nherdsman has just broken jail, killed the jailer, broken his fetters, escaped,\nand run away. Catch him! Catch him!\n\n[ _Enter, in excited haste, Aryaka, an iron chain on one foot. Covering his\nface, he walks about_.]\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. [ _To himself_.] There is great excitement in the city. I must\nget out of the way as fast as I possibly can.\n\n[ _Exit_.\n\n_Aryaka_. I leave behind me that accursed sea\n\nOf human woe and human misery,  \n  The prison of the king.  \nLike elephants that break their chains and flee,  \nI drag a fettered foot most painfully  \n  In flight and wandering.1\n\nKing P\xc4\x81laka was frightened by a prophecy, took me from the hamlet where I\nlived, fettered me, and thrust me into a solitary cell, there to await my\ndeath. But with the help of my good friend Sharvilaka I escaped. [ _He sheds\ntears_.]\n\nIf such my fate, no sin is mine at least,  \nThat he should cage me like a savage beast.  \nA man may fight with kings, though not with fate\xc2\x97  \nAnd yet, can helpless men contend with great?2\n\nWhither shall I go with my wretchedness? [ _He looks about_.] Here is the\nhouse of some good man who hasn\'t locked the side-door.\n\nThe house is old, the door without a lock,  \n          The hinges all awry. p. 98  \nSome man, no doubt, who feels misfortune\'s shock  \n          As cruelly as I.3\n\nI will enter here and wait.\n\n_A voice behind the scenes_. Get up, bullocks, get up!\n\n_Aryaka_. [ _Listening_.] Ah, a bullock-cart is coming this way.\n\nIf this should prove to be a picnic rig,  \n  Its occupants not peevishly inclined;  \nSome noble lady\'s waiting carriage trig;  \n  Or rich man\'s coach, that leaves the town behind\xc2\x97  \nAnd if it empty be, fate proving kind,  \n\xc2\x92Twould seem a godsend to my anxious mind.4\n\n[ _Enter Vardham \xc4\x81naka with the bullock-cart_.]\n\n_Vardham \xc4\x81naka_. There, I\'ve got the cushion. Radanik\xc4\x81, tell mistress\nVasantasen\xc4\x81 that the cart is ready and waiting for her to get in and drive to\nthe old garden Pushpakaranda.\n\n_Aryaka_. [ _Listening_.] This is a courtezan\'s cart, going out of the city.\nGood, I\'ll climb in. [ _He approaches cautiously_.]\n\n_Vardham \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Hears him coming_.] Ah, the tinkling of ankle-rings! The\nlady is here. Mistress, the nose-rope makes the bullocks skittish. You had\nbetter climb in behind. [ _Aryaka does so_.] The ankle-rings tinkle only when\nthe feet are moving, and the sound has ceased. Besides, the cart has grown\nheavy. I am sure the lady must have climbed in by this time. I\'ll go ahead.\nGet up, bullocks, get up! [ _He drives about. Enter V \xc4\xabraka_.]\n\n_V \xc4\xabraka_. Come, come! Jaya, Jayam\xc4\x81na, Chandanaka, Mangala, Phullabhadra, and\nthe rest of you!\n\nSo calm, when the herdsman, slipping his tether,  \nBreaks jail and the heart of the king together?5\n\nHere! You stand at the east gate of the main street, you at the west, you at\nthe south, you at the north. I\'ll climb up the broken wall here with\nChandanaka and take a look. Come on, Chandanaka, come on! This way! [ _Enter\nChandanaka, in excitement_.]\n\np. 99\n\n_Chandanaka_. Come, come! V\xc4\xabraka, Vishalya, Bh\xc4\xabm\xc4\x81ngada, Dandak\xc4\x81la, Dandash\xc5\xabra,\nand the rest of you!\n\nCome quick, my reliables! Work! Now begin!  \nLest the old king go out, and a new king come in.6  \nSearch gardens, and dives, and the town, and the street,  \nThe market, the hamlet, wherever you meet7  \nWith what looks suspicious. Now, V\xc4\xabraka, say,  \nWho saved the young herdsman that just broke away?8  \nWho was born when the sun in his eighth mansion stood,  \nOr the moon in her fourth, or when Jupiter could  \nBe seen in his sixth, or when Saturn was resting  \nIn his ninth, in her sixth house when Venus was nesting,  \nOr Mars in his fifth? 1 Who will dare to be giving  \nThe herdsman protection, while I am still living?9, 10\n\n_V \xc4\xabraka_. Chandanaka, you mercenary!\n\nI swear on your heart, he\'s been long out of prison,  \nFor the herdsman escaped ere the sun was half risen.11\n\n_Vardham \xc4\x81naka_. Get up, bullocks, get up!\n\n_Chandanaka_. [ _Discovers him_.] Look, man, look!\n\nA covered cart is moving in the middle of the road;  \nInvestigate it, whose it is, and where it takes its load!12\n\n_V \xc4\xabraka_. [ _Discovers him_.] Here, driver, stop your cart! Whose cart is\nthis? who is in it? where is it going?\n\n_Vardham \xc4\x81naka_. This is Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\'s cart. Mistress Vasantasen\xc4\x81 is in it. I\nam taking her to the old garden Pushpakaranda to meet Ch\xc4\x81rudatta.\n\n_V \xc4\xabraka_. [ _Approaches Chandanaka_.] The driver says it is Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\'s\ncart; that Vasantasen\xc4\x81 is in it; that he is taking her to the old garden\nPushpakaranda.\n\n_Chandanaka_. Then let it pass.\n\n_V \xc4\xabraka_. Without inspection?\n\np. 100\n\n_Chandanaka_. Certainly.\n\n_V \xc4\xabraka_. On whose authority?\n\n_Chandanaka_. On Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\'s.\n\n_V \xc4\xabraka_. Who is Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, or who is Vasantasen\xc4\x81, that the cart should pass\nwithout inspection?\n\n_Chandanaka_. Don\'t you know Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, man? nor Vasantasen\xc4\x81? If you don\'t\nknow Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, nor Vasantasen\xc4\x81, then you don\'t know the moon in heaven, nor\nthe moonlight.\n\nWho doesn\'t know this moon of goodness, virtue\'s lotus-flower,  \nThis gem of four broad seas, this savior in man\'s luckless hour?13  \nThese two are wholly worshipful, our city\'s ornaments,  \nVasantasen\xc4\x81, Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, sea of excellence.14\n\n_V \xc4\xabraka_. Well, well, Chandanaka! Ch\xc4\x81rudatta? Vasantasen\xc4\x81?\n\nI know them perfectly, as well as I know anything;  \nBut I do not know my father when I\'m serving of my king.15\n\n_Aryaka_. [ _To himself_.] In a former existence the one must have been my\nenemy, the other my kinsman. For see!\n\nTheir business is the same; their ways  \n  Unlike, and their desire:  \nLike flames that gladden wedding days,  \n  And flames upon the pyre.16\n\n_Chandanaka_. You are a most careful captain whom the king trusts. I am\nholding the bullocks. Make your inspection.\n\n_V \xc4\xabraka_. You too are a corporal whom the king trusts. Make the inspection\nyourself.\n\n_Chandanaka_. If I make the inspection, that\'s just the same as if you had\nmade it?\n\n_V \xc4\xabraka_. If you make the inspection, that\'s just the same as if King P\xc4\x81laka\nhad made it.\n\np. 101\n\n_Chandanaka_. Lift the pole, man! [ _Vardham \xc4\x81naka does so_.]\n\n_Aryaka_. [ _To himself_.] Are the policemen about to inspect me? And I have\nno sword, worse luck! But at least,\n\nBold Bh\xc4\xabma\'s spirit I will show;  \n  My arm shall be my sword.  \nBetter a warrior\'s death than woe  \n  That cells and chains afford.17\n\nBut the time to use force has not yet come. [ _Chandanaka enters the cart and\nlooks about_.] I seek your protection.\n\n_Chandanaka_. [ _Speaking in Sanskrit_.] He who seeks protection shall be\nsafe.\n\n_Aryaka_. Whene\xc2\x92er he fight, that man will suffer hurts,\n\n  Will be abandoned of his friends and kin,  \nBecomes a mock forever, who deserts  \n  One seeking aid; \xc2\x92tis an unpardoned sin.18\n\n_Chandanaka_. What! the herdsman Aryaka? Like a bird that flees from a hawk,\nhe has fallen into the hand of the fowler. [ _Reflecting_.] He is no sinner,\nthis man who seeks my protection and sits in Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\'s cart. Besides, he is\nthe friend of good Sharvilaka, who saved my life. On the other hand, there are\nthe king\'s orders. What is a man to do in a case like this? Well, what must\nbe, must be. I promised him my protection just now.\n\nHe who gives aid to frightened men,  \n  And joys his neighbor\'s ills to cure,  \nIf he must die, he dies; but then,  \n  His reputation is secure.19\n\n[ _He gets down uneasily_.] I saw the gentleman\xc2\x97[ _correcting himself_.] I\nmean, the lady Vasantasen\xc4\x81, and she says "Is it proper, is it gentlemanly,\nwhen I am going to visit Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, to insult me on the highway?"\n\n_V \xc4\xabraka_. Chandanaka, I have my suspicions.\n\n_Chandanaka_. Suspicions? How so?\n\np. 102\n\n_V \xc4\xabr_. You gurgled in your craven throat; it seems a trifle shady. You said\n"I saw the gentleman," and then "I saw the lady." That\'s why I\'m not\nsatisfied.\n\n_Chandanaka_. What\'s the matter with you, man? We southerners don\'t speak\nplain. We know a thousand dialects of the barbarians\xc2\x97the Khashas, the Khattis,\nthe Kadas, the Kadatthobilas, the Karn\xc4\x81tas, the Karnas, the Pr\xc4\x81varanas, the\nDr\xc4\x81vidas, the Cholas, the Ch\xc4\xabnas, the Barbaras, the Kheras, the Kh\xc4\x81nas, the\nMukhas, the Madhugh\xc4\x81tas, and all the rest of \xc2\x92em, and it all depends on the\nway we feel whether we say "he" or "she," "gentleman" or "lady."\n\n_V \xc4\xabraka_. Can\'t I have a look, too? It\'s the king\'s orders. And the king\ntrusts me.\n\n_Chandanaka_. I suppose the king doesn\'t trust me!\n\n_V \xc4\xabraka_. Isn\'t it His Majesty\'s command?\n\n_Chandanaka_. [ _Aside_.] If people knew that the good herdsman escaped in\nCh\xc4\x81rudatta\'s cart, then the king would make Ch\xc4\x81rudatta suffer for it. What\'s\nto be done? [ _Reflecting_.] I\'ll stir up a quarrel the way they do down in\nthe Carnatic. [ _Aloud_.] Well, V\xc4\xabraka, I made one inspection myself\xc2\x97my name\nis Chandanaka\xc2\x97and you want to do it over again. Who are you?\n\n_V \xc4\xabraka_. Confound it! Who are you, anyway?\n\n_Chandanaka_. An honorable and highly respectable person, and you don\'t\nremember your own family.\n\n_V \xc4\xabraka_. [ _Angrily_.] Confound you! What is my family?\n\n_Chandanaka_. Who speaks of such things?\n\n_V \xc4\xabraka_. Speak!\n\n_Chandanaka_. I think I\'d better not.\n\nI know your family, but I won\'t say;  \n\'T would not be modest, such things to betray;  \nWhat good\'s a rotten apple anyway?21\n\n_V \xc4\xabraka_. Speak, speak! [ _Chandanaka makes a significant gesture_.] Confound\nyou! What does that mean?\n\np. 103\n\n_Chand_. A broken whetstone in one hand\xc2\x97a thing\n\nThat looks like scissors in the other wing  \nTo trim the scrubby beards that curl and cling,  \nAnd you\xc2\x97why, you\'re a captain of the king!22\n\n_V \xc4\xabraka_. Well, Chandanaka, you highly respectable person, you don\'t remember\nyour own family either.\n\n_Chandanaka_. Tell me. What is the family I belong to, I, Chandanaka, pure as\nthe moon?\n\n_V \xc4\xabraka_. Who speaks of such things?\n\n_Chandanaka_. Speak, speak! [ _V \xc4\xabraka makes a significant gesture_.] Confound\nyou! What does that mean?\n\n_V \xc4\xabraka_. Listen.\n\nYour house is pure; your father is a drum,  \nYour mother is a kettledrum, you scum!  \nYour brother is a tambourine\xc2\x97turn, turn!  \nAnd you\xc2\x97why, you\'re a captain of the king!23\n\n_Chandanaka_. [ _Wrathfully_.] I, Chandanaka, a tanner! You can look at the\ncart.\n\n_V \xc4\xabraka_. You! driver! turn the cart around. I want to look in. [ _Vardham\n\xc4\x81naka does so. V\xc4\xabraka starts to climb in. Chandanaka seizes him violently by\nthe hair, throws him down, and kicks him_.] V\xc4\xabraka. [ _Rising. Wrathfully_.]\nConfound you! I was peaceably going about the king\'s business, when you seized\nme violently by the hair and kicked me. So listen! If I don\'t have you drawn\nand quartered in the middle of the court-room, my name\'s not V\xc4\xabraka.\nChandanaka. All right. Go to court or to a hall of justice. What do I care for\na puppy like you?\n\n_V \xc4\xabraka_. I will.\n\n[ _Exit_.\n\n_Chandanaka_. [ _Looks about him_.] Go on, driver, go on! If anybody asks you,\njust say "The cart has been inspected by Chandanaka and V\xc4\xabraka." Mistress\nVasantasen\xc4\x81, let me give you a passport. [ _He hands Aryaka a sword_.]\n\np. 104\n\n_Aryaka_. [ _Takes it. Joyfully to himself_.]\n\nA sword, a sword! My right eye twitches fast. 1  \nNow all is well, and I am safe at last.24\n\n_Chandanaka_. Madam,\n\nAs I have given you a passage free,  \nSo may I live within your memory.  \nTo utter this, no selfish thoughts could move;  \nAh no, I speak in plenitude of love.25\n\n_Aryaka_. Chandanaka is rich in virtues pure;\n\nMy friend is he\xc2\x97Fate willed it\xc2\x97true and tried.  \nI\'ll not forget Chandanaka, be sure,  \nWhat time the oracle is justified.26\n\n_Chand_. May Shiva, Vishnu, Brahma, Three in One,\n\nProtect thee, and the Moon, and blessed Sun;  \nSlay all thy foes, as mighty P\xc4\x81rvat\xc4\xab  \nSlew Shumbha and Nishumbha\xc2\x97fearfully.27\n\n[ _Exit Vardham \xc4\x81naka, with the bullock-cart. Chandanaka looks toward the back\nof the stage_.] Aha! As he goes away, my good friend Sharvilaka is following\nhim. Well, I\'ve made an enemy of V\xc4\xabraka, the chief constable and the king\'s\nfavorite; so I think I too had better be following him, with all my sons and\nbrothers.\n\n[ _Exit_.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[96:1](lcc12.htm#fr_67) A bad omen, in the case of a woman.\n\n[99:1](lcc12.htm#fr_68) Lall\xc4\x81d\xc4\xabkshita says that these horoscopes indicate\nrespectively distress, colic, stupidity, poverty, sorrow, destruction.\n\n[104:1](lcc12.htm#fr_69) A good omen, in the case of a man.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Act the Seventh: Aryaka\'s Escape](lcc13.htm)\n\n'
