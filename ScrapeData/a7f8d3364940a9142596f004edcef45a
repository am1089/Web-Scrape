II, 8, 1).\n\n2. 2 (The guest to whom the Arghya reception is going to be offered) should come forward murmuring, 'Here I tread on this Padya Vira _g_ for the sake of the enjoyment of food' (ibid. 2).\n\n3\\. (He should do so) where they are going to perform the Arghya ceremony for\nhim,\n\n4\\. Or when they perform it.\n\n5\\. Let them announce three times (to the guest) separately (each of the\nfollowing things which are\n\np. 130\n\nbrought to him): a bed (of grass to sit down on), water for washing the feet,\nthe Argha water, water for sipping, and the Madhuparka (i.e. a mixture of\nghee, curds, and honey).\n\n6\\. Let him spread out the bed (of grass, so that the points of the grass are)\nturned to the north, with (the verse), 'The herbs which' (MB. II, 8, 3), and\nlet him sit down thereon;\n\n7\\. If there are two (beds of grass), with the two (verses) separately (MB.\nII, 8, 3. 4);\n\n8. 8 On the second (he treads) with the feet.\n\n9\\. Let him look at the water (with which he is to wash his feet), with (the\nformula), 'From which side I see the goddesses' (ibid. 5).\n\n10\\. Let him wash his left foot with (the formula), 'The left foot I wash;'\nlet him wash his right foot with (the formula), 'The right foot I wash' (MB.\nII. 8, 6. 7);\n\n11. 11 Both with the rest (of the Mantra, i.e. with the formula), 'First the one, then the other' (II, 8, 8).\n\n12\\. Let him accept the Arghya water with (the formula), 'Thou art the queen\nof food' (ibid. 9).\n\n13\\. The water (offered to him) for sipping he should sip with (the formula),\n'Glory art thou' (ibid. 10).\n\n14\\. The Madhuparka he should accept with (the formula), 'The glory's glory\nart thou' (ibid. 11).\n\n15. 15 Let him drink (of it) three times with (the\n\np. 131\n\nformula which he repeats thrice), 'The glory's food art thou; the might's food\nart thou; the bliss's food art thou; bestow bliss on me' (MB. II, 8, 12);\n\n16. 16 Silently a fourth time.\n\n17\\. Having drunk more of it, he should give the remainder to a Brahma _n_ a.\n\n18\\. After he has sipped water, the barber should thrice say to him, 'A cow!'\n\n19. 19 He should reply, 'Let loose the cow from the fetter of Varu _n_ a; bind (with it) him who hates me. Kill him and (the enemy) of N.N., (the enemies) of both (myself and N.N.). Deliver the cow; let it eat grass, let it drink water' (MB. II, 8, 13).\n\n20\\. (And after the cow has been set at liberty), let him address it with (the\nverse), 'The mother of the Rudras' (MB. II, 8, 14).\n\n21. 21 Thus if it is no sacrifice (at which the Arghya reception is offered),\n\n22\\. (He should say), 'Make it (ready),' if it is a sacrifice.\n\n23\\. There are six persons to whom the Arghya reception is due, (namely),\n\np. 132\n\n24. 24 A teacher, an officiating priest, a Snataka, a king, the father-in-law, a friend coming as a guest.\n\n25. 25 They should offer the Arghya reception (to such persons not more than) once a year.\n\n26\\. But repeatedly in the case of a sacrifice and of a wedding. But\nrepeatedly in the case of a sacrifice and of a wedding.\n\nEnd of the Fourth Prapa _th_ aka.\n\n___________________\n\nEnd of the Gobhila-G _ri_ hya-sutra.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[129:1](sbe30042.htm#fr_444) 10, 1 seq. The Arghya reception; Khadira-G _ri_\nhya IV, 4, 5 seq.; G _ri_ hya-sa _m_ graha II, 62-65. The first words of the\nMantra quoted in Sutra 1 are corrupt. The Mantra is evidently an adaptation of\nthe well-known verse addressed to the \xc3\x82grahaya _n_ i (Gobhila III, 9, 9;\nMantra-Brahma _n_ a II, 2, 1), or to the Ash _t_ aka (Paraskara III, 3, 5, 8):\nprathama ha vyuvasa, &c. The first word arha _n_ a ('duly'), containing an\nallusion to the occasion of the Arghya ceremony, to which this Mantra is\nadapted, seems to be quite right; the third word may be, as Dr. Knauer\nconjectures, uvasa ('she has dwelt,' or perhaps rather 'she has shone'). For\nthe second word I am not able to suggest a correction.\n\n[129:2](sbe30042.htm#fr_445) Regarding Padya Vira _g_ , comp. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana\nIII, 7, 5 note; Paraskara I, 3, 12.\n\n[130:8](sbe30042.htm#fr_446) See Paraskara I, 3, 9.\n\n[130:11](sbe30042.htm#fr_447) The commentary says, _s_ eshe _n_ ava _s_ ish\n_t_ enodakena. Comp., however, Khadira-G _ri_ hya IV, 4, II.\n\n[130:15](sbe30042.htm#fr_448) I have adopted the reading _s_ ribhaksho, which\nis given in the Mantra-Brahma _n_ a, and have followed the opinion of the\ncommentator p. 131 that the whole Mantra, and not its single parts, should be\nrepeated each time that he drinks of the Madhuparka. In the Khadira-G _ri_ hya\nthe text of the Mantra differs, and the rite is described differently (IV, 4,\n15).\n\n[131:16](sbe30042.htm#fr_449) 16, 17. Perhaps these two Sutras should be\nrather understood as forming one Sutra, and should be translated as I have\ndone in Khadira-G _ri_ hya IV, 4, 16.\n\n[131:19](sbe30042.htm#fr_450) Iti after abhidhehi ought to be omitted. Comp.\nthe lengthy discussions on this word, pp. 766 seq. of the edition of Gobhila\nin the Bibliotheca Indica. 'N.N.' is the host who offers the Arghya; comp.\nKhadira-G _ri_ hya IV, 4, 18.\n\n[131:21](sbe30042.htm#fr_451) 21, 22. In the case of a sacrifice the cow is\nkilled; comp. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana II, 15, 2. 3 note; Paraskara I, 3, 30.\n\n[132:24](sbe30042.htm#fr_452) Vivahya is explained in the commentary by\nvivahayitavyo _g_ amata.
