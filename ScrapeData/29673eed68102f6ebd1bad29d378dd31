Now Pra _g_ apati is\nthat sacrifice which is here performed, and whence these creatures have been\n\np. 81\n\nproduced,--and so they are even now produced after this one: he thus places\nhim in the very middle of that Pra _g_ apati, and consecrates him in the\nmiddle.\n\n5:3:5:22\\. Before the Mahendra (cup) has been drawn,--for that Mahendra cup is\nIndra's special (nishkevalya) cup, and so is that Nishkevalya Stotra (hymn)\nand Nishkevalya _S_ astra (recitation); and the Sacrificer is Indra: he thus\nconsecrates him--in his own resting-place. Hence before the Mahendra (cup) has\nbeen drawn,--\n\n5:3:5:33\\. He spreads a tiger-skin in front of the Maitravaru _n_ a's hearth\n1, with (Va _g_. S. X, 5), 'Thou art Soma's beauty.' For because when Soma\nflowed through Indra he (Indra) thereupon became a tiger, therefore he is\nSoma's beauty: this is why he says, 'Thou art Soma's splendour;'--'may my\nbeauty become like unto thine!' He thus bestows the tiger's beauty on him:\ntherefore he says, 'May my beauty become like unto thine!'\n\n5:3:5:44\\. He then offers the Partha oblations. Now P _ri_ thin Vainya was\nconsecrated first of men. He desired that he might appropriate to himself all\nfood. They offered up for him those (oblations), and he appropriated to\nhimself all the food here on earth. They would even call forest beasts to him,\nsaying, 'Come hither thou (beast) so and so, the king wants to cook thee!'\nThus he appropriated all food here on earth; and verily he appropriates to\nhimself all food for whom that knows this those (oblations) are offered.\n\n5:3:5:55\\. There are twelve of them,--for there are\n\np. 82\n\ntwelve months in the year: therefore there are twelve of them.\n\n5:3:5:66\\. Six he offers before, and six after, the consecration: he thereby\nplaces him in the very middle of that Pra _g_ apati, and consecrates him in\nthe middle.\n\n5:3:5:77\\. Now of those which he offers before the consecration, B _ri_\nhaspati is the last (recipient), and of those which he offers after the\nconsecration, Indra is the first;--but B _ri_ haspati is priestly dignity\n(brahma), and Indra is might, vigour: with these two kinds of vigour he thus\nencloses him on both sides.\n\n5:3:5:88\\. Those which he offers before the consecration, he offers (resp.)\nwith, 'To Agni hail!'--Agni is brightness (te _g_ as): with brightness he thus\nsprinkles (endows) him;--'To Soma hail!'--Soma is princely power (kshatra):\nwith princely power he thus sprinkles him;--'To Savit _ri_ hail!'--Savit _ri_\nis the impeller of the gods: impelled by Savit _ri_ he thus consecrates\nhim;--'To Sarasvati hail!'--Sarasvati is Speech: he thus sprinkles him with\nSpeech;--'To Pushan hail!'--Pushan is cattle: with cattle he thus sprinkles\nhim;--'To B _ri_ haspati hail!'--B _ri_ haspati is priestly dignity: with\npriestly dignity he thus sprinkles him. These he offers before the\nconsecration: these are called the Agni-named ones.\n\n5:3:5:99\\. Those which he offers after the consecration, he offers (resp.)\nwith, 'To Indra hail!'--Indra is vigour: with vigour he thus sprinkles\nhim;--'To the roar hail!'--roar means vigour: with vigour he thus sprinkles\nhim;--'To the noise hail! 'noise means vigour: with vigour he thus sprinkles\nhim;--'To A _m_ _s_ a hail!'--A _m_ _s_ a is vigour: with vigour he thus\nsprinkles him;--'To Bhaga hail!'--Bhaga is vigour: with vigour he thus\nsprinkles\n\np. 83\n\nhim;--'To Aryaman hail!'--he thus makes him the friend (aryaman) of everything\nhere. These he offers after the consecration: these are called the \xc3\x82ditya-\nnamed 1 ones.\n\n5:3:5:1010\\. In front of the Maitravaru _n_ a's hearth are the (four)\nconsecration vessels in which that consecration water is contained 2.\n\n5:3:5:1111\\. There is a pala _s_ a (butea frondosa) one: with (the water of)\nthat (vessel) a Brahman sprinkles;--the Pala _s_ a tree is priestly dignity\n(brahman): it is with priestly dignity that he sprinkles (endows) him.\n\n5:3:5:1212\\. There is an udumbara (ficus glomerata) one: therewith one of his\nown (kinsmen, or brothers) sprinkles. The udumbara tree means sustenance,\n(that is) food, and the 'own' means sustenance, for as far as a man's own\ngoes, so far he does not hunger: thereby his 'own' is sustenance, and\ntherefore one of his own (kinsmen) sprinkles with an udumbara (vessel).\n\n5:3:5:1313\\. There is one made of the foot (stem) of the nyagrodha (ficus\nindica): therewith a friendly (mitrya) Ra _g_ anya sprinkles: for by its feet\n3 the\n\np. 84\n\nnyagrodha tree is supported, and by the friend (mitra) the Ra _g_ anya\n(nobleman or king) is supported: therefore a friendly Ra _g_ anya sprinkles\nwith (the water of a vessel) made of the foot of a nyagrodha.\n\n5:3:5:1414\\. There is an a _s_ vattha (ficus religiosa) one: therewith a Vai\n_s_ ya sprinkles. Because Indra on that (former) occasion called upon the\nMaruts staying on the A _s_ vattha tree 1, therefore a Vai _s_ ya sprinkles\nwith an a _s_ vattha (vessel). These are the consecration vessels.\n\n5:3:5:1515\\. He then prepares two strainers (pavitra), with (Va _g_. S. X, 6),\n'Purifiers ye are, Vish _n_ u's own;'--the significance is the same (as before\n2). He weaves gold (threads) into them. With them he purifies those\nconsecration waters. As to why he weaves gold (threads) in,--gold is immortal\nlife: that immortal life he lays into these (waters), and hence he weaves gold\n(threads) in.\n\n5:3:5:1616\\. He purifies with, 'By the impulse of Savit _ri_ I purify you with\na flawless purifier, with the rays of the sun.' The significance is the same\n(as before 3). 'Not downfallen thou art, the friend of Speech, born of heat,'\n--unimpaired by the Rakshas he means to say when he says, 'not\ndownfallen;'--'the friend of Speech'--as long as there is water in the vital\nairs, so long (man) speaks with speech: therefore he says, 'the friend of\nSpeech.'\n\np. 85\n\n5:3:5:1717\\. 'Born of heat' he says, for from fire springs smoke, from smoke\nthe cloud, from the cloud rain,--it is from fire that these are produced:\nhence he says, 'born of heat.'\n\n5:3:5:1818\\. 'Soma's portion thou art;' for when they consecrate him with\nthose (waters), then there is an oblation: therefore he says 'Soma's portion\nthou art;'--'Hail, spiriters of kings!'--it is with 'Hail' that he thus\npurifies them.\n\n5:3:5:1919\\. He distributes them over those (consecration) vessels, with (Va\n_g_. S. X, 7), 'Playmates are these glorious waters;'--'not overbearing' he\nmeans to say, when he says 'playmates;' and by 'these glorious waters' he\nmeans to say 'the powerful ones;'--'unimpaired, active, enveloping,' he\nthereby means to say 'ye are unimpaired by the Rakshas;'--'In the habitations\nVaru _n_ a hath made a home;'--the habitations are the people (clans): 'in the\npeople Varu _n_ a has made a support' he thereby says;--'he, the child of the\nwaters, in the best of mothers;'--for he who performs the Ra _g_ asuya is\nindeed the child of the waters: therefore he says, 'the child of the waters,\nin the best of mothers.'\n\n5:3:5:2020\\. He then makes him (the king) put on garments. There is that one\ncalled tarpya 1; therein are\n\np. 86\n\nwrought 1 all forms of sacrifice: that he makes him put on, with (Va _g_. S.\nX, 8), 'Thou art the inner caul of knighthood (kshatra)!' He thus causes him\nto be born from out of what is the inner caul (amnion) of knighthood.\n\n5:3:5:2121\\. He then makes him put on one of undyed wool, with, 'Thou art the\nouter caul of knighthood!' He thus causes him to be born from what is the\nouter caul (chorion) of knighthood.\n\n5:3:5:2222\\. He then throws over the mantle, with, 'Thou art the womb of\nknighthood!' He thus causes him to be born from what is the womb of\nknighthood.\n\n5:3:5:2323\\. He then draws the head-band together, and conceals it (tucks it\nunder) in front 2, with, 'Thou art the navel of knighthood!' He thus places\nhim in what is the navel of knighthood.\n\n5:3:5:2424\\. Now some wind it quite round about (the navel) saying, 'that\n(band) is his navel, and this navel goes all round.' But let him not do this,\nbut let him merely tuck it under in front, for this navel is in front. And as\nto why he makes him put on the garments;--he thereby causes him to be born 3,\n\np. 87\n\nthinking, 'I will anoint him when born:' that is why he makes him put on the\ngarments.\n\n5:3:5:2525\\. Now some put off those garments 1, and make him put on again the\ngarment of initiation. But let him not do this; for, the limbs 2 being his\nnatural vestments, they deprive him of his limbs, of his native bodily form.\nThe garment of initiation belongs to Varu _n_ a. Let him put on one of those\nsame garments: he (the priest) thereby causes him to be furnished with his\nlimbs, his native bodily form. The garment of initiation belongs to Varu _n_\na: he thus saves him from the Varu _n_ ic garment of initiation.\n\n5:3:5:2626\\. And when he enters the bath 3 they throw it into (the water).\nThis is a congruous 4 performance. After putting on one of those same garments\nhe comes out (of the bath). Let him give away those (garments) either when the\nomentum of the barren cow has been offered 5, or at the completing oblation 6.\n\n5:3:5:2727\\. He (the Adhvaryu) then strings the bow, with, 'Thou art Indra's V\n_ri_ tra-killer;' for the bow\n\np. 88\n\nis indeed a V _ri_ tra-killer, and the Sacrificer is Indra,--he is Indra in a\ntwofold way, both as a Kshatriya, and as Sacrificer: therefore he says, 'Thou\nart Indra's V _ri_ tra-killer.'\n\n5:3:5:2828\\. He then strokes the two arms 1, with, 'Mitra's thou art,--Varu\n_n_ a's thou art;' for the bow is within the two arms, and by his two arms the\nRa _g_ anya pertains to Mitra and Varu _n_ a: therefore he says, 'Mitra's thou\nart, Varu _n_ a's thou art.' He hands it to him, with, 'May he slay V _ri_ tra\nby thee!' whereby he means to say, 'May he slay by thee his spiteful enemy!'\n\n5:3:5:2929\\. He then hands him three arrows. That first-one by which he\npierces on shooting 2, that is one, that one is this earth, that one is called\n'd _ri_ ba.' And the one by which (the enemy) being pierced lies either living\nor dead, that is the second, that is this air, that is called 'ru _g_ a.' And\nthe one with which he misses (his aim) 3, that is the third, that is yonder\nsky, that is called 'kshuma.' For these are the three (kinds of) arrows:\ntherefore he hands him three arrows.\n\n5:3:5:3030\\. These he hands to him with, 'Protect ye him in front 4!--Protect\nye him from behind!--Protect ye him from the side!--Protect ye\n\np. 89\n\nhim from (all) quarters!' Thus he makes all the quarters safe from arrows for\nhim. And as to why he hands the bow to him;--this, the bow, truly is the\nnobleman's strength: it is because he thinks, 'I will consecrate him when\nendowed with strength!' that he hands the weapon to him 1.\n\n5:3:5:3131\\. Thereupon he makes him pronounce the avid formulas 2 (Va _g_. S.\nX, 9), 'In sight, ye mortals! This is mysterious for mysterious is Pra _g_\napati: he thus announces him to Pra _g_ apati, and this one approves of his\nconsecration; and approved by him he is consecrated.\n\n5:3:5:3232\\. 'Present is Agni, the house-lord;'---Agni is the priesthood\n(brahman); he thus announces him to the priesthood; and it approves of his\nconsecration, and approved by it he is consecrated.\n\n5:3:5:3333 'Present is Indra, the far-famed;'--Indra is the nobility: he thus\nannounces him to the nobility; and, it approves of his consecration, and\napproved by it he is consecrated.\n\n5:3:5:3434\\. 'Present are Mitra and Varu _n_ a, the upholders of the law;'--\nMitra and Varu _n_ a are the out-breathing and in-breathing: he thus announces\nhim to the out-breathing and in-breathing, and they approve of his\nconsecration, and approved by them he is consecrated.\n\n5:3:5:3535\\. 'Present is Pushan, the all-possessing;'\n\np. 90\n\n[paragraph continues] Pushan is (the lord of) cattle: he thus announces him to\nthe cattle, and they approve of his consecration; and approved by them he is\nconsecrated.\n\n5:3:5:3636\\. 'Present are Heaven and Earth, the all-propitious;'--he thus\nannounces him to those two, the heaven and the earth, and they approve of his\nconsecration; and approved by them he is consecrated.\n\n5:3:5:3737\\. 'Present is Aditi, of wide shelter;'--Aditi is this earth: he\nthus announces him to this earth, and she approves of his consecration, and\napproved by her he is consecrated. Thus to whatever deities he announces him,\nthey approve of his consecration, and approved by them he is consecrated.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[81:1](sbe4117.htm#fr_161) Viz. before the 'waters' deposited there, according\nto [V, 3, 4, 28](sbe4116.htm#5:3:4:28).\n\n[83:1](sbe4117.htm#fr_162) Viz. because three of the recipients of these\nlibations--A _m_ _s_ a, Bhaga and Aryaman--belong to the deities called\n\xc3\x82dityas, or sons of Aditi.\n\n[83:2](sbe4117.htm#fr_163) The water in the Udumbara vessel is now distributed\ninto these four (smaller) vessels.\n\n[83:3](sbe4117.htm#fr_164) That is, by its pendant branches. It is well known\nthat the ficus indica, or banyan-tree, as it is ordinarily called, has the\nhabit of bending its branches down to the ground, which then strike root and\ndevelop new secondary trunks, so that a single tree may in course of time form\na large grove. Hence the name here used for the tree (nyag-rodha, the\ndownward-growing one). 'A family tends to multiply families around it, till it\nbecomes the centre of a tribe, just as the banyan tends to surround itself\nwith a forest of its own offspring.' Maclennan, Primitive Marriage, p. 269.\n\n[84:1](sbe4117.htm#fr_165) See above, [p. 34](sbe4108.htm#page_34), note\n[1](sbe4108.htm#fn_80). The Maruts are constantly identified with the Vi _s_ ,\nor people (peasants, &c.) generally, whilst Indra is taken as the divine\nrepresentative of the ruling class (the king and nobleman).\n\n[84:2](sbe4117.htm#fr_166) See I, 1, 3, 1 (part i, p. 19).\n\n[84:3](sbe4117.htm#fr_167) See I, 1, 3, 6 (part i, p. 21).\n\n[85:1](sbe4117.htm#fr_168) This is variously explained, by Katyayana and Saya\n_n_ a, as a linen one, or simply one soaked in ghee, or a tripa _n_ a one--\ni.e. one made of tripar _n_ a plants, or a thrice saturated one (with\nghee)--or one woven out of materials derived from the t _ri_ pa plant. It is\nquite evident that they did not exactly know what to make of it. Indeed, it\nwould almost seem as if the author of the Brahma _n_ a himself was already\ndoubtful as to the meaning of the term. Goldstucker (s.v. abhishe _k_ aniya)\nperhaps rightly takes it to mean a silk under-garment.\n\n[86:1](sbe4117.htm#fr_169) According to the commentators, figures of\nsacrificial spoons, cups, &c., are sewn in by means of a needle.\n\n[86:2](sbe4117.htm#fr_170) The commentators do not seem to be quite in accord\nin regard to this particular item of the ceremonial. The most natural\nexplanation, however, seems to be this: the head-band (turban, ush _n_ isha)\nis wound (? once) round the head and tied behind; the ends being then drawn\nover the shoulders so as to hang down from the neck in the manner of a\nbrahmanical cord (or like the ribbon of an order); and being finally tucked in\nunder the mantle somewhere near the navel.\n\n[86:3](sbe4117.htm#fr_171) Viz. inasmuch as the garments are intended to\nsymbolically represent the vestures of the embryo and stages of birth.\n\n[87:1](sbe4117.htm#fr_172) This change of garments takes place optionally when\nthe Mahendra libation is about to be offered. Katy. XV, 5, 16; 7, 23-26.\n\n[87:2](sbe4117.htm#fr_173) That is, according to Saya _n_ a, the skin, &c.\n\n[87:3](sbe4117.htm#fr_174) That is, at the end of the Ra _g_ asuya. In case of\nthe change of garments before the Mahendra libation, the king keeps on the\ninitiation garment in entering and coming out of the bath. This paragraph is\nof course put in here by anticipation, merely in order to state all that\nrelates to the garments.\n\n[87:4](sbe4117.htm#fr_175) Viz. inasmuch as it is in accordance with what is\ndone at an ordinary Soma-sacrifice, at the end of which the Sacrificer and his\nwife enter the bath and come forth with fresh garments. See part ii, p. 385.\nIn the present case the king is to enter the bath clothed in one of those\nthree garments, and in coming out he is to put on another of them.\n\n[87:5](sbe4117.htm#fr_176) See part ii, pp. 391-2.\n\n[87:6](sbe4117.htm#fr_177) For the Udavasaniya-ish _t_ i, see ib. p. 389.\n\n[88:1](sbe4117.htm#fr_178) Viz. the arms of the king, as it would seem,\naccording to Saya _n_ a; but the arms (or ends) of the bow, according to Karka\nand Mahidhara.\n\n[88:2](sbe4117.htm#fr_179) Literally, on fixing (the arrow on the string); or\nperhaps, on hitting (the enemy).\n\n[88:3](sbe4117.htm#fr_180) Saya _n_ a takes apa-radhnoti in the sense of 'he\nhurts (or hits)' the enemy. In the Ka _n_ va text (Grantha MS.) the three\narrows are called ru _g_ a, d _ri_ va, and kshupa resp.\n\n[88:4](sbe4117.htm#fr_181) Or perhaps,--whilst (he is) moving forward,--whilst\nmoving backward,--whilst moving sideways.\n\n[89:1](sbe4117.htm#fr_182) For a sham fight with arrows forming part of the\nceremony in the Black Ya _g_ us ritual, see [p. 100](sbe4120.htm#page_100).\nnote [1](sbe4120.htm#fn_199).\n\n[89:2](sbe4117.htm#fr_183) That is, as would seem, the formulas of information\n(or perhaps of announcement, introduction); the first of these formulas\nbeginning with avis (in sight), the others with the participle avitta, i.e.\n'obtained, present;' Saya _n_ a and Mahidhara, however, taking it in the sense\nof 'informed,'--a meaning which, indeed, the word may perhaps have been\nintended to convey in these formulas.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 4, 1.
