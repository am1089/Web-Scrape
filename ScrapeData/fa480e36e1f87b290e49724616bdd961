In obtaining a different (body) (the soul) goes enveloped (by subtle parts\nof the elements), (as appears from) question and explanation.\n\nIn the second adhyaya we have refuted the objections raised against the\nVedantic of Brahman on the ground of Sm _ri_ ti and reasoning; we have shown\nthat all other opinions are devoid of foundation, and that the alleged mutual\ncontradictions of Vedic texts do not exist. Further we have demonstrated that\nthe entities different from--but subordinate to--the individual soul (such as\npra _n_ a, &c.) spring from Brahman.--Now in the third adhyaya we shall\ndiscuss the following subjects: the manner in which the soul together with its\nsubordinate adjuncts passes through the sa _m_ sara (III, 1); the different\nstates of the soul and the nature of Brahman (III, 2); the separateness or\nnon-separateness of the vidyas and the question whether the qualities (of\nBrahman) have to be cumulated or not (III, 3); the accomplishment of man's\nhighest end by means of perfect knowledge (sa _m_ yagdar _s_ ana), the\ndifferent injunctions as to the means of perfect knowledge and the absence of\ncertain rules as to release which is the fruit (of perfect knowledge 1) (III,\n4). As occasion leads some other matters also will be explained.--The first\npada explains, on the ground of the so-called vidya of the five fires ( _Kh_.\nUp. V, 3-10), the different modes of the soul's passing through the sa _m_\nsara; the reason of that doctrine being (the inculcation of) absence\n\np. 102\n\nof all desire (vairagya), in accordance with the scriptural remark at the end\n(of the vidya), 'hence let a man take care to himself.'--The soul accompanied\nby the chief vital air, the sense-organs and the mind, and taking with itself\nnescience (avidya), moral good or ill-desert (karman), and the impressions\nleft by its previous existences 1, leaves its former body and obtains a new\nbody; this is known from the scriptural passage extending from B _ri_. Up. IV,\n4, 1 ('Then those pra _n_ as gather around him') up to IV, 4, 4 ('It makes to\nitself another newer and more beautiful shape'); which passage forms part of a\nchapter treating of the sa _m_ sara-state. And it moreover follows from the\npossibility (thus resulting) of the soul enjoying the fruits of good and evil\nactions.--Here the question arises whether the soul when going to the new body\nis enveloped or not by subtle parts of the elements constituting the seeds of\nthe body.--It is not so enveloped, the purvapakshin.--Why?--Because scripture,\nwhile stating that the soul takes the organs with itself, does not state the\nsame with regard to the elements. For the expression 'those parts of light'\n(te _g_ omatra _h_ ) occurs in the passage 'He taking with him those parts of\nlight,' &c., intimates that the organs only are taken (and not the elements),\nsince in the complementary portion of the passage the eye, &c., are spoken of,\nand not the subtle parts of the elements. The subtle parts of the elements can\nmoreover easily be procured anywhere; for wherever a new body is to be\noriginated they are present, and the soul's taking them with itself would,\ntherefore, be useless. Hence we conclude that the soul when going is not\nenveloped by them.\n\nTo this the teacher replies, 'in obtaining another it goes enveloped.' That\nmeans: we must understand that the soul when passing from one body to another\nis enveloped by the subtle parts of the elements which are the seeds of the\nnew\n\np. 103\n\nbody.--How do we know this?--'From the question and the explanation.' The\nquestion is, 'Do you know why in the fifth libation water is called man?' (V,\n3, 3.) The explanation, i.e. answer, is given in the entire passage which,\nafter having explained how the five libations in the form of _s_ raddha, rain,\nfood, seed are offered in the five fires, viz. the heavenly world, Par _g_\nanya, the earth, man and woman, concludes, 'For this reason is water in the\nfifth oblation called man.' Hence we understand that the soul goes enveloped\nby water.--But--an objection will be raised--another scriptural passage\ndeclares that like a caterpillar the soul does not abandon the old body before\nit makes an approach to another body 1. (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 3, 'And as a\ncaterpillar.')--We reply that what there is compared to the (action of the)\ncaterpillar is (not the non-abandonment of the old body but) merely the\nlengthening out of the creative effort whose object is the new body to be\nobtained, which (new body) is presented by the karman of the soul 2 _H_ ence\nthere is no contradiction.--As the mode of obtaining a new body is thus\ndeclared by _S_ ruti, all hypotheses which owe their origin to the mind of man\nonly are to be set aside because they are contradicted by scripture. So e.g.\nthe opinion (of the Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khyas) that the Self and the organs are both all--\npervading 3, and when obtaining a new body only begin to function in it in\nconsequence of the karman; or the opinion (of the Bauddhas) that the Self\nalone\n\np. 104\n\n(without the organs) begins to function in a new body, and that as the body\nitself, so new sense-organs also are produced in the new abode of fruition 1;\nor the opinion (of the Vai _s_ eshikas) that the mind only proceeds to the new\nabode of fruition 2; or the opinion (of the Digambara _G_ ainas) that the\nindividual soul only flying away from the old body alights in the new one as a\nparrot flies from one tree to another.--But--an objection will be raised--from\nthe quoted question and answer it follows that the soul goes enveloped by\nwater only, according to the meaning of the word made use of by scripture,\nviz. water. How then can the general statement be maintained that the soul\ngoes enveloped by subtle parts of all elements?--To this doubt the next Sutra\nreplies.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[101:1](sbe38077.htm#fr_64) I.e. the absence of a rule laying down that\nrelease consequent on knowledge takes place in the same existence in which the\nmeans of reaching perfect knowledge are employed.\n\n[102:1](sbe38077.htm#fr_65) I read avidya the commentators (Go. \xc3\x82n., however,\nmentions the reading 'vidya,' also); although vidya appears preferable.
