There is non-restriction of the assertions concerning them (i.e. the\nassertions made concerning certain sacrificial acts are not permanently\nconnected with those acts), because this is seen (in scripture); for a\nseparate fruit, viz. non-obstruction (of the success of the sacrifice),\n(belongs to them).\n\nWe meet in the Vedanta-texts with certain vidyas which are founded on matters\nsubordinate to sacrificial acts. To this class belongs, e.g. the first vidya\nof the _Kh_ andogya Upanishad, 'Let a man meditate on the syllable Om as\nudgitha.'--We now enter on an inquiry whether those\n\np. 253\n\nvidyas are permanently connected with the acts in the same way as the\ncircumstance of being made of par _n_ a-wood is permanently connected with all\nsacrifices in which the _g_ uhu (the sacrificial ladle) is used; or if they\nare non-permanent like the vessel called godohana 1. The purvapakshin\nmaintains that the meditations are permanently connected with the sacrificial\nacts, because they also are comprised within the scriptural enouncements\nconcerning performances. For they also do not stand under some special heading\n2, and as they are connected with the sacrifice through the udgitha and so on,\nthey combine themselves, like other subordinate members, with the scriptural\nstatements as to the performance of the sacrifice.\n\nIf against the doctrine of the meditations forming permanent parts of the\nsacrificial performances it should be urged, that in the chapters containing\nthem special results are mentioned (which seem to constitute the meditations\ninto independent acts), as e.g. in the passage, 'he indeed becomes a fulfiller\nof desires' ( _Kh_. Up. I, 1, 7); we reply that those statements of results\nbeing given in the text in the present form only (not in an injunctional\nform), are mere\n\np. 254\n\narthavada-passages--like the statement about him whose _g_ uhu is made of par\n_n_ a-wood hearing no evil sound--and thus do not aim at enjoining certain\nresults.--Hence, just as the statement about being made of par _n_ a-wood--\nwhich does not occur under a definite prakara _n_ a--connects itself, by means\nof the sacrificial ladle, with the sacrifice, and thus forms a permanent\nelement of the latter no less than if it were actually made under the heading\nof the sacrifice; so the meditations on the udgitha, &c., also form permanent\nparts of the sacrifices.\n\nTo this we make the following reply. 'There is non-restriction of the\nassertions concerning them.' That means: the assertions which the text makes\nconcerning the nature of certain subordinate members of sacrificial acts such\nas the udgitha and so on--as e.g. that the udgitha is the best of all essences\n( _Kh_. Up. I, 1, 3), the fulfiller of desires (I, 1, 7), a gratifier of\ndesires (I, 1, 8),,the chief pra _n_ a (I, 2, 7), \xc3\x82ditya (I, 3, 1)--cannot be\npermanently connected with the sacrificial acts in the same way as other\npermanent members are, 'because that is seen,' i.e. because scripture shows\nthat they are not so permanently connected. For scripture allows also such as\nare not acquainted with the details mentioned above to perform the sacrificial\nactions (cp. the passage I, 1, 10, 'Therefore both he who knows this, and he\nwho does not, perform the sacrifice'), and declares that even those priests,\nPrastot _ri_ and so on, who are devoid of the knowledge of the divinities of\nthe prastava and the like, do perform the sacrifices 'Prastot _ri_ , if you\nwithout knowing the deity which belongs to the prastava are going to sing it,'\n&c. (I, 10, 9 and ff.).--The sacred text moreover declares that the vidyas,\nfounded on certain elements of sacrificial acts have results of their own,\napart from those acts, viz. 'non-obstruction' in the accomplishment of the\nfruit of the sacrifice, i.e. a certain additional success of the sacrifice,\ncp. the passage I, 1, 10, 'Therefore he who knows this and he who does not\nperform the sacrifice. But knowledge and ignorance are separate. The sacrifice\nwhich a man performs with knowledge, faith, and the Upanishad is more\npowerful.' The declaration made in this passage\n\np. 255\n\nthat the performances of him who knows and of him who does not know are\nseparate, and the employment of the comparative form ('more powerful') show\nthat even the sacrifice destitute of the vidya is powerful. But how would that\nbe possible if the vidya formed a permanent necessary part of the sacrifice?\nIn the latter case a sacrifice devoid of that vidya could never be admitted to\nbe powerful; for it is an established principle that only those sacrifices are\neffective which comprise all subordinate members. Thus the text also teaches\ndefinite results for each meditation, in the section treating of the\nmeditation on the Saman as the worlds and others: 'The worlds in an ascending\nand in a descending line belong to him,' &c. ( _Kh_. Up. II, 2, 3).--Nor must\nwe understand those declarations of results to be mere arthavadas; for in that\ncase they would have to be taken as stating a secondary matter only, while if\nunderstood to teach certain results they may be taken in their principal (i.e.\ndirect, literal) sense 1. The case of the results which scripture declares to\nbe connected with the praya _g_ as e.g. is of a different nature. For the\npraya _g_ as. are enjoined with reference to a sacrifice (viz. the dar _s_\napur _n_ amasa) which requires certain definite modes of procedure (such as\nthe offering of the praya _g_ as and the like), and hence subserve that\nsacrifice; so that the passage stating a fruit for the praya _g_ as has to be\nconsidered as a mere arthavada-passage 2. In the case again of the quality of\nconsisting of par _n_ a-wood--which quality is stated ex abrupto, not under a\ndefinite heading--no special result can be assumed; for as a quality is not an\nact, it cannot be connected with any result unless it be joined to something\nto abide in. The use of the godohana indeed may have its own injunction of\n\np. 256\n\nresult, for it does possess such an abode--viz. the act of water being carried\n(in it)--with reference to which it is enjoined. So again a special fruit may\nbe enjoined for the case of the sacrificial post being made of bilva-wood; for\nthis latter quality likewise has an abode, viz. the sacrificial post with\nreference to which it is enjoined. But in the case of the quality of\nconsisting of par _n_ a-wood there is no such established abode under the\nheading of which that quality is enjoined; and if we assumed that the sentence\n('He whose _g_ uhu is made of par _n_ a-wood hears no evil sound ') after\nintimating that the quality of consisting of par _n_ a-wood resides in the _g_\nuhu is also meant to enjoin the fruit thereof, we should impute to the text\nthe imperfection called 'split of the sentence.'--The meditations on the other\nhand are themselves acts, and as such capable of a special injunction; hence\nthere is no reason why a special result should not be enjoined for those\nmeditations which are based on sacrificial acts. The conclusion therefore is\nthat the meditations on the udgitha, &c., although based on sacrifices, are\nyet not necessary members of the latter, because they have results of their\nown like the use of the godohana-vessel. For this reason the authors of the\nKalpa-sutras have not represented such meditations as belonging to the\nsacrificial performances.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[253:1](sbe38185.htm#fr_159) The question is raised whether the meditations,\nenjoined in the Upanishads, on certain parts or elements of sacrificial acts,\nare permanently connected with the latter, i.e. are to be undertaken whenever\nthe sacrificial act is performed, or not.--In the former case they would stand\nto the sacrifice in the same relation as the par _n_ amayitva, i.e. the\nquality of being made of par _n_ a-wood, does. Just as the latter is connected\nwith the sacrifice by means of the guhu\\--the sacrificial ladle,--so the\nmeditation on the syllable Om, e.g. would be connected with the sacrifice by\nmeans of that syllable.--In the latter case, i.e. in the case of being\nconnected with the sacrifice on certain occasions only, the upasana is\nanalogous to the godohana-vessel which is used in the dar _s_ apur _n_ amasa-\nsacrifice instead of the usual _k_ amasa, only if the sacrificer specially\nwishes for cattle.--See Pu. Mi. Su. III, 6, 1; IV, 1, 2.\n\n[253:2](sbe38185.htm#fr_160) Like the statement about the par _n_ amayitva of\nthe _g_ uhu which the sacred text does not exhibit under some particular\nprakara _n_ a, but ex abrupto as it were; on which account it is to be\nconnected with the sacrifice in general.\n\n[255:1](sbe38185.htm#fr_161) The statement as to the result of an action is a\n'statement of a principal matter' if it is really meant to inform us that a\ncertain result will attend a certain action. It is a statement of a 'secondary\nmatter' if it is only meant to glorify the action.\n\n[255:2](sbe38185.htm#fr_162) Not as a passage enjoining a special result for\nthe praya _g_ as; for the latter merely help to bring about the general result\nof the dar _s_ apur _n_ amasa and have no special result of their own.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 43](sbe38186.htm)\n\n"
