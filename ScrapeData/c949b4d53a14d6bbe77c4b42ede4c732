Tame animals must not be eaten, 1\n\n2\\. Nor carnivorous and (tame) birds, 2\n\n3\\. Nor (tame) cocks and pigs; 3\n\n4\\. Goats and sheep (are) excepted (from the above prohibition).\n\n5\\. Five five-toed animals may be eaten, (viz.) the porcupine, the iguana, the\nhare, the hedgehog, the tortoise and the rhinoceros, excepting the rhinoceros,\n5\n\n6\\. Likewise five animals with cloven hoofs, (viz.) the white-footed antelope\n(Nil-gai), the (common ravine) deer, the spotted deer, the buffalo, the (wild)\nboar and the black antelope, excepting the black antelope, 6\n\n7\\. (Likewise) five (kinds of) birds that feed scratching with their feet,\n(viz.) the partridge, the blue rock-pigeon, the francoline partridge, the\n(crane called) Vardhra _n_ asa, the peacock and the Vara _n_ a, excepting the\nVara _n_ a, 7\n\np. 185\n\n8\\. (And the following) fishes, (viz.) the Silurus Pelorius (Sahasrada _m_ sh\n_t_ rin), the _K_ ili _k_ ima, the Varmi, the B _ri_ ha _k_ _kh_ iras, the Ma\n_s_ akari(?), the Cyprinus Rohita, and the Ra _g_ i. 8\n\n9\\.

Vasish _th_ a XIV, 40.\n\n[184:2](sbe1445.htm#fr_920) Vasish _th_ a XIV, 48. Govinda says that the\nparticle _k_ a, 'and,' is used in order to indicate that the word 'tame' must\nbe understood.\n\n[184:3](sbe1445.htm#fr_921) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 17, 29, 32.\n\n[184:5](sbe1445.htm#fr_922) Vasish _th_ a XIV, 39. Another explanation of the\nword _s_ vavi _t_ , 'the porcupine' (see also Gautama XVII, 27), is given in\nthe commentary, which says that it is a wild animal resembling a dog, and\nbelonging to the boar species. Govinda points out that there is a dispute\namong the learned regarding the rhinoceros (Vasish _th_ a XV, 47), and that\nthe peculiar wording of the Sutra is intended to indicate that.\n\n[184:6](sbe1445.htm#fr_923) The permissibility of the last-named animal is\nagain doubtful.\n\n[184:7](sbe1445.htm#fr_924) Gautama XVII, 35. The case of the last-mentioned\nbird, the Vara _n_ a, is again doubtful. From the first rock-edict of A _s_\noka p. 185 it appears that peacocks, now considered inviolable, were actually\neaten in the third century A. D.\n\n[185:8](sbe1445.htm#fr_925) Vasish _th_ a XIV, 41-42. The names are much\ncorrupted in the MSS., and for Ma _s_ akari, which I do not find in the\ndictionaries, Sama _s_ akari or Samasakari is also read. The B _ri_ ha _k_\n_kh_ iras is probably the Indian salmon, the Mahsir.\n\n[185:9](sbe1445.htm#fr_926)-10. Vasish _th_ a XIV, 34-35 Gautama XVII, 22. The\nmeaning of sandhini, 'a female animal that gives milk while big with young,'\nis uncertain. See also Vish _n_ u LI, 40 \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 17, 23.\n\n[185:11](sbe1445.htm#fr_927) Gautama XVII, 24.\n\n[185:12](sbe1445.htm#fr_928) Vish _n_ u LI, 38-41.\n\n[185:14](sbe1445.htm#fr_929) Gautama XVII, 16.\n\n[185:15](sbe1445.htm#fr_930) Vasish _th_ a XIV, 37-38.\n\n[185:16](sbe1445.htm#fr_931) Vasish _th_ a XIII, 1-5. Govinda states that this\nSutra has been introduced here, because the purity of one's food ensures p.\n186 purity of one's soul, and purity of soul gives strength of memory, and\nthereby makes one fit to study the Veda.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Adhyaya 6, Ka _n_ _d_ ika 13](sbe1446.htm)\n\n"
