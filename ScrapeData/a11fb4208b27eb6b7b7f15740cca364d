 \nSay, canst thou see, O faultless dame,  \nA cause to till his soul with flame?  \nFor there must be a reason when  \nSuch fury stirs the king of men.  \nReveal the sin, if sin of mine  \nAnger the lord of Raghu's line.  \nOr go thyself, his rage subdue,  \nAnd with soft words his favour woo.  \nSoon as on thee his eyes are set  \nHis heart this anger will forget,  \nFor men like him of lofty mind  \nAre never stern with womankind.  \nFirst let thy gentle speech disarm  \nHis fury, and his spirit charm,  \n\nAnd I, from fear of peril free,  \nThe conqueror of his foes will see.'  \n   She heard: with faltering steps and slow,  \nWith eyes that shone with trembling glow.  \nWith gold-girt body gently bent  \nTo meet the stranger prince she went.  \nWhen Lakshman saw the Vanar queen  \nWith tranquil eyes and modest mien,  \nBefore the dame he bent his head,  \nAnd anger, at her presence, fled.  \nMade bold by draughts of wine, and cheered  \nBy Lakshman look no more she feared,  \nAnd in the trust his favour lent  \nShe thus addressed him eloquent:  \n'Whence springs thy burning fury? say;  \nWho dares thy will to disobey?  \nWho checks the maddened flames that seize  \nOn forests full of withered trees?  \n  Then Lakshman spoke, her mind to ease,  \nHis kind reply in words like these:  \n  'Thy lord his days in pleasure spends,  \nHeedless of duty and of friends.  \nNor dost thou mark, though fondly true,  \nThe evil path his steps pursue.  \nHe cares not for affairs of state,  \nNor us forlorn and desolate,  \nBut sits a mere spectator still,  \nA sensual slave to pleasure's will.  \nFour months were fixed, the time agreed  \nWhen he should help us in our need:  \nBut, bound in toils of pleasure fast,  \nHe sees not that the months are past.  \nWhere beats the heart which draughts of wine  \nTo virtue or to gain incline?  \nHast thou nor heard those draughts destroy  \nVirtue and gain and love and joy?  \nFor those who, helped at need, refuse  \nTheir aid in turn, their virtue lose:  \nAnd they who scorn a friend disdain  \nA treasure naught may buy again.  \nThy lord has cast his friend away,  \nNor feared from virtue's path to stray.  \nIf this he true, declare, O dame  \nWho knowest duty's every claim.  \nWhat further work remains for us  \nDeceived and disappointed thus.'  \n   She listened, for his words were kind.  \nWhere virtue showed with gain combined,  \nAnd thus in turn the prince addressed,  \nAs hope was rising in his breast:  \n'No time, no cause of wrath I see  \nWith those who live and honour thee:  \nAnd thou shouldst bear without offence  \nThy servant's fitful negligence.  \nI know the seasons glide away,  \nWhile Rama maddens at delay  \nI know what deed our thanks has earned,  \nI know that grace shonld be returned  \nBut still I know, whatever befall,  \nThat conquering love is lord of all;  \n\np. 366  \n\nKnow where Sugriva's thoughts, possessed  \nBy one absorbing passion, rest.  \nBut he whom sensual joys debase  \nHeeds not the claim of time and place,  \nAnd sees not with his blinded sight  \nHis duty or his gain aright.  \nO pardon him who loves me! spare  \nThe Vanar caught in pleasure's snare,  \nAnd once again let Rama grace  \nWith favour him who rules our race.  \nE'en royal saints, whose chief delight  \nWas penance and austerest rite,  \nAt love's commandment have unbent,  \nBeguiled by sweetest blandishment.  \nAnd know, Sugriva, roused at last,  \nThe order to his lords has passed.  \nAnd, long by love and bliss delayed.  \nWakes all on fire your hopes to aid.  \nA countless host his city fills,  \nNew-gathered from a thousand hills:  \nImpetuous chiefs, who wear at need  \nEach varied form, his legions lead.  \nCome then, O hero, kept aloof  \nBy modest awe, nor fear reproof:  \nA faithful friend untouched by blame  \nMay look upon another's dame.'  \n   He passed within, by Tara pressed,  \nAnd by his own impatient breast.  \nRefulgent there in sunlike sheen  \nSugriva on his throne was seen.  \nGay garlands round his neck were twined,  \nAnd Ruma by her lord recline.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[364:1b](ry307.htm#fr_638) Maireya, a spirituous liquor from the blossoms of\nthe Lythrum fruticosum, with sugar, &c.;\n\n[364:2b](ry307.htm#fr_639) Their names are as follows: Angad, Mainda, Dwida,\nGavaya, Gavaksha, Gaja, Sarabha, Vidyunmali, Sampati, Suryaksa, Hanuman,\nVirabahu, Subaha, Nala, Kumuda, Sushena, Tara, Jambuvatu, Dadhivakra, *Nila,\nS'upatala, and Sunetra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXXIV.: Lakshman's Speech](ry308.htm)\n\n"
