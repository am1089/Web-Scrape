And as the carpenter, in double fashion.\n\nThat the embodied Self is an agent, has been proved by the reasons set forth\nin Sutra 33, &c. We now have to consider whether this agency depends on the\nfundamental nature of the Self, or is due to its limiting adjuncts.--If here\nit be maintained that for the same reasons which were employed to prove the\nSelf's being an agent its agency must be held to be natural, there being no\nreasons to the contrary, we reply as follows.\n\np. 53\n\nThe Self's being an agent cannot be founded on its real nature, because (if it\nwere so) the impossibility of final release would follow. For if being an\nagent belongs to the soul's nature, it can never free itself from it--no more\nthan fire can divest itself of heat--and as long as man has not freed himself\nfrom activity he cannot obtain his highest end, since activity is essentially\npainful.--But, an objection will be raised, the end of man may be obtained,\neven as long as the potentiality of activity remains, viz. by man avoiding the\neffects of activity, and this he may accomplish by avoiding its occasions,\njust as fire, for instance, although endowed with the potentiality of burning,\ndoes, if fuel is withheld from it, not produce its natural effect, i.e.\nburning.--This objection we invalidate by the remark that the occasions,\nbecause connected (with the soul) by means of the peculiar connexion called\n'potentiality' (power), cannot be avoided absolutely 1.--Nor can it be said\nthat release will be obtained through the means effecting it being employed,\nbecause whatever depends on means to be employed is non-eternal. Scripture\nmoreover declares that release results from the instruction about the\neternally pure, intelligent, free Self. Now instruction of this nature would\nnot be possible, if the agentship of the Self formed part of its nature. The\nagentship of the Self is therefore due to the attributes of its adjuncts being\nascribed to it, and does not form part of its nature. Hence scripture says of\nthe Self, 'As if thinking, as if moving' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 7), and 'He (the\nSelf) when in union with the body, the senses, and the mind, is called the\nenjoyer by wise people' (Ka. Up. I. 3, 4); which passages show that the Self\npasses into the special condition of being an enjoyer, &c., only through its\n\np. 54\n\nconnexion with the limiting adjuncts. For to the discerning there is no Self\ncalled the living Self and being either agent or enjoyer, apart from the\nhighest Self; according to the scriptural passage 'There is no other seer but\nhe,' &c. (B _ri_. Up. III. 7, 23). Nor must we suppose that, if there were no\nintelligent individual Soul, different from the highest Self and distinct from\nthe aggregate consisting of buddhi, &c., it would follow that the highest Self\nis involved in the sa _m_ sara-state as agent and enjoyer. For the conditions\nof being agent and enjoyer are presented by Nescience merely. Scripture also,\nafter having declared (in the passage, 'For where there is duality, as it\nwere, there one sees the other,' &c., B _ri_. Up. IV, 5, 15) that the\nconditions of being an agent and an enjoyer belong to the state of Nescience\nonly, excludes them from the state of knowledge, 'But where the Self only is\nall this, how should he see another?' And again, after having declared that\nthe Self, in the states of waking and of dreaming, suffers weariness owing to\nthe contact with its limiting adjuncts, like a falcon flying about in the air,\nscripture teaches that that fatigue ceases in deep sleep when the soul is\nembraced by the intelligent (highest) Self. 'This indeed is his true form in\nwhich his wishes are fulfilled, in which the Self only is his wish, in which\nno wish is left,--free from any sorrow'--up to 'This is his highest goal, this\nis his highest success, this is his highest world, this is his highest bliss'\n(B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 21-32).--This the teacher intimates in the Sutra, 'and as\nthe carpenter in both ways.' 'And' is here used in the sense of 'but.' It is\nnot to be supposed that the agentship of the Self belongs to its true nature,\nas heat belongs to the nature of fire. But just as in ordinary life a\ncarpenter as long as working with his axe and other tools undergoes pain,\nwhile on the other hand he enjoys ease and leisure after having finished his\nwork, laid his tools aside and returned to his home; so the Self also, as long\nas it is joined with duality presented by Nescience and is an agent in the\nstates of waking and dreaming, undergoes pain; but as soon as, for the purpose\nof shaking off its weariness, it enters into its own highest Self, it frees\nitself from the complex of effects and instruments, and enjoys full ease in\n\np. 55\n\nthe state of deep sleep. And in the state of final release also, the Self,\nhaving dispelled the darkness of ignorance by the light of knowledge, and\nhaving reached the state of absolute isolation and rest, enjoys full ease.--\nThe case of the carpenter must be considered as being parallel to the\nfollowing extent. The carpenter is, in certain kinds of work, such as cutting\nwood, &c., an agent with regard to certain definite tools, such as the axe and\nso on, but a non-agent with his mere body; so this Self also is an agent in\nall its functions with regard to its instruments, such as the mind, &c., but\nis a non-agent by its own Self. On the other hand, the Self has no parts\ncorresponding to the hands and other limbs of the carpenter, by means of which\nit could take up or put aside its instruments, as the carpenter takes up and\nputs aside his tools.\n\nIn reply to the reasons brought forward in favour of the soul's agentship\nbeing natural, as, for instance, the reason based on scripture having a\npurport, we remark that the scriptural injunctions in prescribing certain acts\npresuppose an agentship established somehow, but do not themselves aim at\nestablishing the (direct) agentship of the Self. Now we have shown that the\nagentship of the Self does not constitute part of its real nature because\nscripture teaches that its true Self is Brahman; we therefore conclude that\nthe Vedic injunctions are operative with reference to that agentship of the\nsoul which is due to Nescience. Such scriptural passages also as 'The agent,\nthe person whose Self is understanding' (Pr. Up. IV, 9), must be assumed,\nbecause being of the nature of anuvadas 1, to refer to an agentship already\nestablished elsewhere, and being the product of Nescience.\n\nThe preceding remarks refute also the reasons founded on 'the wandering about'\nand the 'taking' (Sutras 34, 35), as the statements about them also are mere\nanuvadas.--But an objection may be raised, the passage which teaches that the\nsoul while its instruments are asleep, 'moves about,\n\np. 56\n\naccording to its pleasure, within its own body' (B _ri_. Up. II. 1, 18),\nclearly implies that the pure Self is an agent. And in the passage relative to\nthe taking ('(the purusha) having through the intelligence of the senses\nabsorbed all intelligence'), the fact of the instruments appearing in the\nobjective and instrumental cases likewise intimates that the pure Self is the\nagent.--To this we reply that even in the state of dream the instruments of\nthe Self are not altogether at rest; for scripture states that even then it is\nconnected with the buddhi, 'Having become a dream, together with buddhi it\npasses beyond this world.' Sm _ri_ ti also says, 'When, the senses being at\nrest, the mind not being at rest is occupied with the objects, that state know\nto be a dream.' And scripture says that desire, &c., are modifications of the\nmind (cp. B _ri_. Up. I, 5, 3). Now these are observed in dreams; therefore\nthe Self wanders about in dreams together with the mind only. That wandering\nabout moreover is founded on the mental impressions (vasana) only, is not\nreal. Thus scripture also in describing our doings in dreams qualifies them by\nan 'as it were:' 'As it were rejoicing together with women, or laughing as it\nwere, or seeing terrible sights' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 13). Ordinary people also\ndescribe their dreams in the same manner, 'I ascended as it were the summit of\na mountain,' 'I saw a tree as it were.'--And although it is true that, in the\nstatement about the taking, the instruments are exhibited in the objective and\ninstrumental cases, still the agentship of the Self must be considered as\nconnected with those instruments, since we have shown that the pure Self\ncannot be an agent.\n\nIn ordinary language also we meet with similar variations of expression; the\ntwo sentences, for instance, 'the warriors fight' and 'the king fights by\nmeans of his warriors,' really have the same meaning. Moreover, the statement\nabout the taking means to express only the cessation of activity on the part\nof the instruments, not the independent activity of any one.--The passage\nreferred to above, 'understanding performs the sacrifice,' establishes the\nagentship of the buddhi merely, as the word 'understanding' is known to\n\np. 57\n\nhave that sense, and as the mind is mentioned close by, and as in the passage,\n'Faith is its head,' &c., faith and so on are declared to be the members of\nthe Self which consists of understanding, and as faith, &c., are known to be\nattributes of the buddhi. Another reason is furnished by the complementary\nsentence, 'All gods worship understanding as the oldest, as Brahman' (Taitt.\nUp. II, 5), for buddhi is known to be the oldest, i.e. the first produced 1.\nAnother scriptural passage also avers that that sacrifice is accomplished by\nmeans of speech and buddhi, 'The sacrifice is what results from speech and\nmind.' Nor can it rightly be maintained (cp. Sutra 38) that to view the\ninstruments as agents would lead to an exchange of power on the part of the\nbuddhi; for all instruments must necessarily be considered as agents in regard\nof their special functions 2. But with reference to perception (upalabdhi)\nthose instruments are (not agents, but) mere instruments, and perception\nbelongs to the Self. Nor can agentship be ascribed to the Self on account of\nperception, since permanent perception constitutes its nature (and hence\ncannot be viewed as a mere transitory activity). Nor can the agentship which\nhas self-consciousness for its antecedent belong to the perceiving principle\n(upalabdh _ri_ ); for self-consciousness itself is an object of perception (on\nthe part of the upalabdh _ri_ , i.e. the pure, isolated, intelligent Self).\nAnd on this doctrine there is no occasion for assuming a further instrument,\nas we maintain the buddhi itself to be the instrument.\n\nThe objection founded on the impossibility of meditation (Sutra 39) is already\nrefuted by the fact, pointed out above, of scripture having a purport,\nmeditation being enjoined by scripture with reference to such agentship as is\nalready established by other passages.--The result of all this is\n\np. 58\n\nthat the agentship of the Self is due to its limiting adjuncts only.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[53:1](sbe38041.htm#fr_35) Kart _ri_ tvasya dharmadini nimittani tesha _m_ _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ ananivartyatve muktav api sambhavat kart _ri_ tva _m_ syat _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anena\ntanniv _ri_ ttau tesham a _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anakaryatvat k _ri_ ta _m_ kart _ri_ tvam\napi tatha syat, _s_ akte _s_ _k_ a _s_ akta- _s_ akyasapekshataya\nsanimittakriyalaksha _n_ a _s_ akyapekshakatvad anirmokshas tasman\nnimittapariharasya duranush _th_ anatvan na _s_ aktivade muktir iti. \xc3\x82n.
