On the path beginning with light, that being known.\n\nThe Sutras now go on to determine the road which the soul of the wise man\nfollows, after having--assisted by the Person within the heart--passed out of\nthe body by way of one particular artery. Now of that road various accounts\nare given in Scripture. There is a detailed account in the _Kh_ andogya. (IV,\n15), 'now whether people perform obsequies for him or not,' &c. Another\naccount is given in the eighth book of the same Upanishad,' then he moves\nupwards by those very rays ' (VIII, 6, 5).\n\nThe Kaushitakins again give a different account: 'He having reached the path\nof the Gods comes to the world of Agni,' &c. (Kau. Up. I, 3). Different again\nin the B _ri_ had-ara _n_ yaka: 'Those who thus know this and those who in the\nforest meditate on faith and the True,' &c. (B _ri_. Up. VI, 2, 15). The same\nUpanishad, in another place (V, 10), gives a different account: 'When the\nperson goes away from this world he comes to the wind,' &c.--A doubt here\narises whether all these texts mean to give instruction as to one and the same\nroad--the first stage of which is light--having to be followed by the soul of\nthe wise man; or whether they describe different roads on any of which the\nsoul may proceed.--The Purvapakshin holds the latter view; for he says the\nroads described differ in nature and are independent one of the other.--This\nview the Sutra disposes of. All texts mean one and the same road only, viz.\nthe one beginning with light, and the souls proceed on that road only. For\nthat road is known, i.e. is recognised in all the various descriptions,\nalthough it is, in different texts, described with more or less fulness. We\ntherefore have to proceed here as in the case of the details (gu _n_ a) which\nare mentioned in different meditations referring to one and the same object,\ni.e. we\n\np. 745\n\nhave to combine the details mentioned in different places into one whole. The\ntwo _Kh_ aandogya-texts--the one in the Upako _s_ alavidya and the one in the\nVidya of the five fires--describe exactly the same road. And in the Vidya of\nthe five fires as given in the B _ri_ had-ara _n_ yaka the same road,\nbeginning with light, is also described, although there are differences in\nminor points; we therefore recognise the road described in the _Kh_ andogya.\nAnd in the other texts also we everywhere recognise the divinities of certain\nstages of the road, Agni, \xc3\x82ditya, and so on.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_\na of 'that which begins with light.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 2.
