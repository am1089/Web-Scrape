(The soul is) an agent, on account of scripture having a purport\n(thereby).\n\nIn connexion with the doctrine that the soul possesses for its essence the\nqualities of the buddhi, another attribute of the soul is set forth.--The\nindividual soul is an agent, because thus scripture has a purport. For only on\nthat assumption scriptural injunctions (such as 'He is to sacrifice,' 'He is\nto make an oblation into the fire,' 'He is to give,' &c.) acquire a purport;\notherwise they would be purportless. For they all teach special acts to be\ndone by agents; which would not be possible if the soul did not possess the\nquality of being an agent.--On that supposition a meaning belongs to the\nfollowing passage also, 'For it is he who sees, hears, perceives, conceives,\nacts, he the person whose Self is knowledge' (Pr. Up. IV, 9).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 34](sbe38035.htm)\n\n"
