Brahma is Incogitable.--Brahma or \xc4\x80tm\xc4\x81, being an absolute Reality, the\nsupreme Thing-in-Itself, is therefore inconceivable by the reason, and only\ncapable of being comprehended by an inspired intuition. The Self, whether\nuniversal or individual, is a single subject of thought, and so cannot be an\nobject of thought; and it is by nature absolute, above all conditions of\nfinite determination. This negative conception is most forcibly expressed by\nthe famous formula ascribed to Y\xc4\x81jnavalkya, _neti   neti,_ "not so, not so," a\ndenial of all possible predicates to the Self (B.A. IV. ii. 4, IV. 22, v. 15,\netc.), and also by frequently describing Brahma or \xc4\x80tm\xc4\x81 in contradictory terms\nas limitless, infinitely extended and yet immeasurably limited in space and\ntime, and denying to it all activity as cause or effect. See also B.A. II. iv.\n14, III. iv. 2, vii. 23, viii. 11, Ch. III. xiv. 2, VII. xxiv. 1, Kena. III.,\nXI., Ka\xe1\xb9\xadh. VI. 12 f. \xc5\x9aankara (on Brahma-s\xc5\xabtra II. iii. 29) explains these\ncontradictions in the description of the size of the Self by asserting that\nthe mention of it as immeasurably small refers to its condition as empiric\nsoul, when it is limited by "determinations" (\xc2\xa7 12) and is conceived under the\nattributes of the "determination" of intelligence, _buddh_ i (\xc2\xa7 18).\n\n\xc5\x9aankara (on Brahma-s\xc5\xabtra III. ii. 17) tells a tale of a sage who, on being\nasked to teach the doctrine of Brahma, remained silent, and on the request\n\np. 34\n\nbeing thrice repeated said simply, "I have told you, but you understand not;\nthis Self is still" (cf. Ch. III. xiv. 1).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Parmenides](brk17.htm)\n\n'
