Yea! Son of Kunti! for this flesh ye see  \nIs Kshetra, is the field where Life disports;  \nAnd that which views and knows it is the Soul,  \nKshetrajna. In all "fields," thou Indian prince!  \nI am Kshetrajna. I am what surveys!  \nOnly that knowledge knows which knows the known  \nBy the knower! What it is, that "field" of life,  \nWhat qualities it hath, and whence it is,  \nAnd why it changeth, and the faculty  \nThat wotteth it, the mightiness of this,  \nAnd how it wotteth- hear these things from Me!\n\nThe elements, the conscious life, the mind,  \nThe unseen vital force, the nine strange gates  \nOf the body, and the five domains of sense;  \nDesire, dislike, pleasure and pain, and thought  \nDeep-woven, and persistency of being;  \nThese all are wrought on Matter by the Soul!\n\nHumbleness, truthfulness, and harmlessness,  \nPatience and honour, reverence for the wise.  \nPurity, constancy, control of self,  \nContempt of sense-delights, self-sacrifice,  \nPerception of the certitude of ill  \nIn birth, death, age, disease, suffering, and sin;  \nDetachment, lightly holding unto home,  \nChildren, and wife, and all that bindeth men;  \nAn ever-tranquil heart in fortunes good  \nAnd fortunes evil, with a will set firm  \nTo worship Me- Me only! ceasing not;  \nLoving all solitudes, and shunning noise  \nOf foolish crowds; endeavours resolute  \nTo reach perception of the Utmost Soul,  \nAnd grace to understand what gain it were  \nSo to attain,- this is true Wisdom, Prince!  \nAnd what is otherwise is ignorance!\n\nNow will I speak of knowledge best to know-  \nThat Truth which giveth man Amrit to drink,  \nThe Truth of HIM, the Para-Brahm, the All,  \nThe Uncreated; not Asat, nor Sat,  \nNot Form, nor the Unformed; yet both, and more;-  \nWhose hands are everywhere, and everywhere  \nPlanted His feet, and everywhere His eyes  \nBeholding, and His ears in every place  \nHearing, and all His faces everywhere  \nEnlightening and encompassing His worlds.  \nGlorified in the senses He hath given,  \nYet beyond sense He is; sustaining all,  \nYet dwells He unattached: of forms and modes  \nMaster, yet neither form nor mode hath He;  \nHe is within all beings- and without-  \nMotionless, yet still moving; not discerned  \nFor subtlety of instant presence; close  \nTo all, to each; yet measurelessly far!  \nNot manifold, and yet subsisting still  \nIn all which lives; for ever to be known  \nAs the Sustainer, yet, at the End of Times,  \nHe maketh all to end- and re-creates.  \nThe Light of Lights He is, in the heart of the Dark  \nShining eternally. Wisdom He is  \nAnd Wisdom\'s way, and Guide of all the wise,  \nPlanted in every heart.\n\nSo have I told  \nOf Life\'s stuff, and the moulding, and the lore  \nTo comprehend. Whoso, adoring Me,  \nPerceiveth this, shall surely come to Me!\n\nKnow thou that Nature and the Spirit both  \nHave no beginning! Know that qualities  \nAnd changes of them are by Nature wrought;  \nThat Nature puts to work the acting frame,  \nBut Spirit doth inform it, and so cause  \nFeeling of pain and pleasure. Spirit, linked  \nTo moulded matter, entereth into bond  \nWith qualities by Nature framed, and, thus  \nMarried to matter, breeds the birth again  \nIn good or evil yonis.  \nYet is this-  \nYea! in its bodily prison!- Spirit pure,  \nSpirit supreme; surveying, governing,  \nGuarding, possessing; Lord and Master still  \nPURUSHA, Ultimate, One Soul with Me.\n\nWhoso thus knows himself, and knows his soul  \nPURUSHA, working through the qualities  \nWith Nature\'s modes, the light hath come for him!  \nWhatever flesh he bears, never again  \nShall he take on its load. Some few there be  \nBy meditation find the Soul in Self  \nSelf-schooled; and some by long philosophy  \nAnd holy life reach thither; some by works:  \nSome, never so attaining, hear of light  \nFrom other lips, and seize, and cleave to it  \nWorshipping; yea! and those- to teaching true-  \nOverpass Death!  \nWherever, Indian Prince!  \nLife is- of moving things, or things unmoved,  \nPlant or still seed- know, what is there hath grown  \nBy bond of Matter and of Spirit: Know  \nHe sees indeed who sees in all alike  \nThe living, lordly Soul; the Soul Supreme,  \nImperishable amid the Perishing:  \nFor, whoso thus beholds, in every place,  \nIn every form, the same, one, Living Life,  \nDoth no more wrongfulness unto himself,  \nBut goes the highest road which brings to bliss.  \nSeeing, he sees, indeed, who sees that works  \nAre Nature\'s wont, for Soul to practise by  \nActing, yet not the agent; sees the mass  \nOf separate living things- each of its kind-  \nIssue from One, and blend again to One:  \nThen hath he BRAHMA, he attains!  \nO Prince!  \nThat Ultimate, High Spirit, Uncreate,  \nUnqualified, even when it entereth flesh  \nTaketh no stain of acts, worketh in nought!  \nLike to th\' ethereal air, pervading all,  \nWhich, for sheer subtlety, avoideth taint,  \nThe subtle Soul sits everywhere, unstained:  \nLike to the light of the all-piercing sun  \n[Which is not changed by aught it shines upon,]  \nThe Soul\'s light shineth pure in every place;  \nAnd they who, by such eye of wisdom, see  \nHow Matter, and what deals with it, divide;  \nAnd how the Spirit and the flesh have strife,  \nThose wise ones go the way which leads to Life!\n\nHERE ENDETH CHAPTER XIII OF THE  \nBHAGAVAD-GITA,  \nEntitled "Kshetrakshetrajnavibhagayog,"  \nOr "The Book of Religion by Separation of Matter and Spirit."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 14: Of Religion by Separation from the Qualities](bg14.htm)\n\n'
