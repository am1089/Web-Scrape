Charm to procure influence in the assembly.\n\n1\\. May assembly and meeting, the two daughters of Pragapati, concurrently aid\nme! May he with whom I shall meet co-operate with me, may I, O ye Fathers,\nspeak agreeably to those assembled!  \n2\\. We know thy name, O assembly: 'mirth,' verily, is thy name; may all those\nthat sit assembled in thee utter speech in harmony with me!  \n3\\. Of them that are sitting together I take to myself the power and the\nunderstanding: in this entire vathering render, O Indra, me successful!  \n4\\. If your mind has wandered to a distance, or has been enchained here or\nthere, then do we turn it hither: may your mind take delight in me!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 94.
