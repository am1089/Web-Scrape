XVII.\n\nAkrura\'s meditations on Krishn\xcc\x81a: his arrival at Gokula: his delight at seeing\nKrishn\xcc\x81a and his brother.\n\nAKR\xc3\x9aRA, having set off in his quick travelling car, proceeded to visit\nKrishn\xcc\x81a at the pastures of Nanda; and, as he went along, he congratulated\nhimself on his superior good fortune, in having an opportunity of beholding a\ndescended portion of the deity. "Now," thought he, "has my life borne fruit;\nmy night is followed by the dawn of day; since I shall see the countenance of\nVishn\xcc\x81u, whose eyes are like the expanded leaf of the lotus. I shall behold\nthat lotus-eyed aspect of Vishn\xcc\x81u, which, when seen only in imagination, takes\naway the sins of men. I shall to-day behold that glory of glories, the mouth\nof Vishn\xcc\x81u, whence proceeded the Vedas, and all their dependant sciences. I\nshall see the sovereign of the world, by whom the world is sustained; who is\nworshipped as the best of males, as the male of sacrifice in sacrificial\nrites. I shall see Ke\xc5\x9bava, who is without beginning or end; by worshipping\nwhom with a hundred sacrifices, Indra obtained the sovereignty over the gods.\nThat Hari, whose nature is unknown to Brahma, Indra, Rudra, the A\xc5\x9bwins, the\nVasus, \xc3\x81dityas, and Maruts, will this day touch my body. The soul of all, the\nknower of all, he who is all, and is present in all, he who is permanent,\nundecaying, all-pervading, will converse with me. He, the unborn, who has\npreserved the world in the various forms of a fish, a tortoise, a boar, a\nhorse 1, a lion, will this day speak to me. Now the lord of the earth, who\nassumes shapes at will, has taken upon him the condition of humanity, to\naccomplish some object cherished in his heart. That Ananta, who holds the\nearth upon his crest, and who has descended upon earth for its protection,\nwill this day call me by my\n\np. 542\n\nname. Glory to that being, whose deceptive adoption of father, son, brother,\nfriend, mother, and relative, the world is unable to penetrate. Glory to him,\nwho is one with true knowledge, who is inscrutable, and through whom, seated\nin his heart, the Yogi crosses the wide expanse of worldly ignorance and\nillusion. I bow to him, who, by the performers of holy rites, is called the\nmale of sacrifice (Yajnapurusha); by pious worshippers is termed Vasudeva; and\nby the cultivators of philosophy, Vishn\xcc\x81u. May he in whom cause and effect,\nand the world itself, is comprehended, be propitious to me, through his truth;\nfor always do I put my trust in that unborn, eternal Hari; by meditation on\nwhom, man becomes the repository of all good things."\n\nHis mind thus animated by devout faith, and meditating in this manner, Akrura\nproceeded on his road, and arrived at Gokula a little before sunset, at the\ntime of the milking of the cows; and there he saw Krishn\xcc\x81a amongst the cattle,\ndark as the leaf of the full blown lotus; his eyes of the same colour, and his\nbreast decorated with the Srivatsa mark; long armed, and broad chested; having\na high nose, and a lovely countenance, brightened with mirthful smiles;\ntreading firmly on the ground, with feet whose nails were tinted red; clad in\nyellow garments, and adorned with a garland of forest flowers; having a fresh-\ngathered creeper in his hand, and a chaplet of white lotus flowers on his\nhead. Akrura also beheld there Balabhadra, white as a jasmine, a swan, or the\nmoon, and dressed in blue raiment; having large and powerful arms, and a\ncountenance as radiant as a lotus in bloom; like another Kailasa mountain,\ncrested with a wreath of clouds.\n\nWhen Akrura saw these two youths, his countenance expanded with delight, and\nthe down of his body stood erect with pleasure: for this he thought to be\nsupreme happiness and glory; this, the double manifestation of the divine\nVasudeva; this was the twofold gratification of his sight, to behold the\ncreator of the universe: now he hoped that his bodily form would yield fruit,\nas it would bring him in contact with the person of Krishn\xcc\x81a; and that the\nwearer of infinite forms would place his hand on his back; the touch of whose\nfinger alone is sufficient to dispel sin, and to secure imperishable felicity:\nthat hand which launches the fierce\n\np. 543\n\nirresistible discus, blazing with all the flames of fire, lightning, and the\nsun, and slaughtering the demon host washes the collyrium from the eyes of\ntheir brides: that hand into which Bali poured water, and thence obtained\nineffable enjoyments below the earth, and immortality and dominion over the\ngods for a whole Manwantara, without peril from a foe. "Alas! he will despise\nme, for my connexion with Kansa, an associate with evil, though not\ncontaminated by it. How vain is his birth, who is shunned by the virtuous? and\nyet what is there in this world unknown to him who resides in the hearts of\nall men, who is ever existent, exempt from imperfection, the aggregate of the\nquality of purity, and identical with true knowledge? With a heart wholly\ndevoted to him, then, I will approach the lord of all lords, the descended\nportion of Purushottama, of Vishn\xcc\x81u, who is without beginning, middle, or\nend."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[541:1](vp134.htm#fr_1502) The commentator explains this to mean Hayagriva, or\nVishn\xcc\x81u with the neck and head of a horse; who, it is said in the second book\nof the Bhagavata, appeared at the end of a great sacrifice performed by\nBrahma, and breathed from his nostrils the texts of the Vedas. The fourth\nAvatara is always elsewhere said to be the Vamana, or dwarf.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XVIII](vp135.htm)\n\n'
