I, 264-267.--36-50. M. III, 276; Y. I,\n261-263; \xc3\x82past. II, 7, 16, 8-22; Gaut. XV, 4.--52, 53. M. III, 273, 274.\nRegarding Sutras 1-7, see the Introduction.\n\n1\\. Nand. states that the _S_ raddhas mentioned in this chapter are of the\nkamya sort, i.e. 'offered for the gratification of a special desire.'\n\n2\\. 1 This is Nand.'s interpretation of the term saubhagyam. It might also be\ntaken in its usual acceptation, as meaning 'happiness.'\n\n8-35. Those names of the twenty-eight Nakshatras or lunar asterisms, which I\nhave included in parentheses, are from Nand.'s Commentary. Most of the objects\nwhich are said to be gained by the _S_ raddhas mentioned in Sutras 8-35 are\nconnected etymologically, or through their import, with the names of the\nparticular Nakshatras under which they are performed. Thus the term push _t_\ni, 'prosperity,' in Sutra 13, is etymologically connected with Pushya; the\nterm mitra, 'friend,' in 22, is connected with Maitra; the term ra _g_ yam,\n'royalty,' in 23, is connected with _S_ akra, the name of that Nakshatra being\nderived from _S_ akra, a name of Indra, the king of the gods, &c.]\n\np. 243\n\n9\\.

See, however, the\nnext Sutra.\n\n48\\. The term saubhagyam is stated by Nand. (with reference to Y. I, 2 64) to\ndenote 'superiority among his kindred,' in this Sutra. But there is no cogent\nreason for deviating here from that interpretation of the term which he\nproposes in his Commentary on Sutras 2 and 16. See above.]\n\np. 246\n\n50\\.
