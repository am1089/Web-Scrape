The bridegroom, who has bathed and for whom auspicious ceremonies have\nbeen performed, is escorted by happy young women, who are not widows, to the\ngirl's house.\n\n2\\. To these he shall not behave unobsequiously, except where forbidden food\nor a transgression is concerned.\n\n3\\. Having obtained their permission, he then gives her the garment with (the\nverse), 'The Raibhi was' (Rig-veda X, 85, 6).\n\np. 33\n\n4\\. With (the verse), 'Mind was the cushion' (ibid. 7) he takes up the salve-\nbox.\n\n5 5. The verse for the Anointing is, 'May the Vi _s_ ve devas anoint (or,\nunite),' (ibid. 47.)\n\n6 6. 'As this (has protected) _S_ a _k_ i the beloved one, and Aditi the\nmother of noble sons, and Apala who was free from widowhood, nay it thus here\nprotect thee, N.N.!'\xc2\x97with these words (the. bridegroom) gives her into her\nright hand the quill of a porcupine (and) a string of three twisted threads,\n\n7\\. With the verse, 'Shape by shape' (Rig-veda VI, 47, 18) a mirror into the\nleft.\n\n8\\. Her relations tie (to her body) a red and black, woollen or linen cord\nwith three (amulet) gems, with the verse, 'Dark-blue and red' (Rig. veda X,\n85, 28).\n\n9\\. With the verse, 'Full of honey the herbs' (Rig-veda IV, 57, 3), (the\nbridegroom) ties (to her body) Madhuka flowers.\n\np. 34\n\n10 10. At the wedding one cow, when the Argha ceremony has been performed; in\nthe house one cow: these are the two Madhuparka cows.\n\n11 11. (The bridegroom) makes the girl sit down behind the fire, and while she\ntakes hold of him he makes three oblations with the Mahavyah _ri_ tis.\n\np. 35\n\n12\\. A fourth (oblation) with (the three Mahavyah _ri_ tis) together is to be\nunderstood from this rule.\n\n13\\. In this way, where no express rule is stated, in all sacrifices that\nprocure happiness, one is to sacrifice before and afterwards with these same\n(Mahavyah _ri_ tis).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[33:5](sbe29014.htm#fr_74) 12, 5. On the ceremony of 'salving together' (sama\n_\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ana), comp. Paraskara I, 4, 14; Gobhila II, 2, &c. Professor Stenzler\nis certainly wrong in translating Paraskara's sama _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ayati by 'heisst\nsie beide zusammentreten' (according to _G_ ayarama's explication,\nsammukhikaroti). It is clear from _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana, that a real anointing of\nbridegroom and bride took place. This was performed, according to Gobhila, by\nthe 'audaka' (this seems to be the same person that is mentioned in Paraskara\nI, 8, 3), of whom it is said, pa _n_ igraha _m_ (i.e. the bridegroom) murdhade\n_s_ e \xc2\x92vasi _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ati, tathetaram. Naraya _n_ a, on the contrary, in his\nnote on our passage, says that it is the bridegroom who anoints the eyes of\nthe girl with the verse quoted. But the word sam-a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ana, and the\nobvious meaning of the whole rite, make it rather probable that both were\nanointed, and that this was done by a third person.\n\n[33:6](sbe29014.htm#fr_75) Comp. below, chap. 22, 8, where the use of a\nporcupine's quill is prescribed at the simantonnayana ceremony; and see chap.\n22, 10.\n\n[34:10](sbe29014.htm#fr_76) As to the meaning of arhayitva I differ from the\nopinion of Naraya _n_ a (see his note on p. 127 of the German edition), who\ntakes gam as the object of this verb (gam arhayitva pu _g_ ayitva mata rudra\n_n_ am ity _ri_ _k_ a _m_ _g_ apitva [comp. Paraskara I, 3, 27]). The real\nmeaning of arhayati is, to perform the Argha ceremony for a guest. Evidently\nin this Sutra two different occasions are stated on which the Argha reception,\neventually with the killing of a cow, should be performed; firstly, the\nbridegroom should be so received in the house of the bride's father; secondly,\nwhen the newly-married people have arrived at their own house, an Argha\nreception should there be offered to them, perhaps, as the commentaries state,\nby the \xc3\x82 _k_ arya.\n\n[34:11](sbe29014.htm#fr_77) According to Naraya _n_ a it is the \xc3\x82 _k_ arya who\nperforms the rite prescribed in this Sutra; Rama _k_ andra, on the contrary,\nrefers it to the bridegroom, which seems to me right. Comp. Gobhila II, 1.\n\nIn _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana's description of the wedding ceremonies the point at which\nthe bride passes over from the paternal power into that of her new husband is\nnot expressly indicated. Paraskara (I, 4, 15) clearly indicates it (pitra\nprattam adaya), and in the Pari _s_ ish _t_ a of the \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana-G _ri_ hya\nthis act of handing over the girl is treated of in detail (I, 22). On this\ndepends the description in the Prayogaratna, fol. 69; comp. also Colebrooke's\nMiscell. Essays, I, 210. The Paddhati of Rama _k_ andra does not fail to\nmention the kanyapradana, but I do not think that the succession of the\ndifferent rites is stated there correctly. According to the Paddhati the\nbridegroom goes to the house of the girl's father, and there, after the\nmadhuparka has been offered, the bride is given over to him; he then\n(labdhavadhuka _h_ ) goes (chap. 12, 1), accompanied by young women, to the\nkautukagara, where the ceremonies described in chap. 12, 3 seq. take place.\nParaskara, on the contrary, describes the handing over of the garments, the\nanointing, &c., as preceding the giving over of the girl, and indeed it is\nscarcely possible to see in the acts of dressing, adorning the girl, &c., in\nwhich both the bridegroom and her relations p. 35 take part, anything but\npreparatory performances that precede the decisive moment. The sacrifice, on\nthe contrary, which the bridegroom performs, according to chap. 12, 11, in\ncommon with his bride, seems to presuppose that he has already received her\nfrom her father; and the ceremonies described in chap. 13, the pa _n_ igraha\n_n_ a, the pronouncing of the Mantra, chap. 13, 4, which reminds one of the\nRoman formula ubi tu Gaius, the seven steps\xc2\x97all that should be understood not\nas intended to establish the power of the husband over his wife, but as\npresupposing that power and showing an exercise of it.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 13](sbe29015.htm)\n\n"
