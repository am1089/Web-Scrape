If it be said that (the effect is) non-existing; we say no, there being a\nmere denial.\n\nBut, an objection is raised, if Brahman, the cause, differs in nature from the\neffect, viz. the world, this means that cause and effect are separate things\nand that hence the effect does not exist in the cause, i.e. Brahman; and this\nagain implies that the world originates from what has no existence!--Not so,\nwe reply. For what the preceding Sutra has laid down is merely the denial of\nan absolute rule demanding that cause and effect should be of the same nature;\nit was not asserted that the effect is a thing altogether different and\nseparate from the cause. We by no means abandon our tenet that Brahman the\ncause modifies itself so as to assume the form of a world differing from it in\ncharacter. For such is the case with the honey\n\np. 419\n\nand the worms also. There is difference of characteristics, but--as in the\ncase of gold and golden bracelets--there is oneness of substance.--An\nobjection is raised.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 8.
