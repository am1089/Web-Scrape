The guardian of people, the watchful one, Agni, the highly dexterous, has\nbeen born, for the sake of new welfare. With gh _ri_ ta on his face, with his\nmighty, heaven-touching (light) he, the bright one, brilliantly shines for the\nBharatas.\n\n2\\. Agni, the beacon of sacrifice, the first Purohita\n[1](sbe46115.htm#an_5:11:2:1) men have kindled in the threefold abode\n[2](sbe46115.htm#an_5:11:2:2). (Driving) on the same chariot with Indra and\nwith the gods, he, the highly wise Hot _ri_ , has sat down on the Barhis for\nsacrificing.\n\n3\\. Though not cleansed, thou art born bright from thy two mothers\n[1](sbe46115.htm#an_5:11:3:1). Thou hast arisen as the joy-giving sage\nbelonging to Vivasvant [2](sbe46115.htm#an_5:11:3:2) They have strengthened\nthee by gh _ri_ ta, O Agni, into whom oblations are poured. Smoke, reaching\nthe sky, has become thy beacon.\n\n4\\. May Agni straightway come to our sacrifice. Men carry Agni here and there,\nhouse by house. Agni has become the messenger, the carrier of oblations.\nChoosing Agni they choose a thoughtful (god).\n\n5\\. For thee, O Agni, is this sweetest speech, for thee this prayer; may this\none do thy heart good [1](sbe46115.htm#an_5:11:5:1)! The prayers fill thee\nwith power and strengthen thee, like great rivers the Sindhu.\n\n6\\. Thee, O Agni, who wert hidden, dwelling here and there in every wood, the\nA\xe1\xb9\x85giras have discovered [1](sbe46115.htm#an_5:11:6:1). Thus thou art born,\nproduced by attrition, a mighty force. Thee, O A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, they call the son of\nstrength.\n\np. 392\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe _Ri_ shi is Sutambhara \xc3\x82treya, the metre _G_ agati.--Verses I, 6, 2 = SV.\nII, 257-259; TS. IV, 4, 4, 2-3\\. Verses 1, 6, 5 = MS. II, 13, 7. Verses 1, 6 =\nVS. XV, 27-28\\. Verse 3 = TB. II, 4, 3, 3.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. This Pada is identical with the first Pada of X. 122, 4.\n\nNote 2. The three sacrificial fires are alluded to.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. The two kindling-sticks.\n\nNote 2. Vivasvata _h_ is genitive, not ablative, as Pischel, Vedische Studien,\nI, 241, believes. Agni opens his earthly career by doing service at the\nsacrifice of Vivasvant, i. e. originally, in my opinion, the first man. Comp.\nH. O., Religion des Veda, p. 122.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. On the curious spelling manisha\xc2\xb4 iyam in the Sa _m_ hita text, instead\nof mani\xc2\xb4sheyam, see the Rig-veda Prati _s_ akhya 163; H. O., Prolegomena, p.\n386.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. The ancestors of the priestly tribes, being the first priests\nthemselves, discover Agni.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 12](sbe46116.htm)\n\n'
