Narayanasvami Aiyar, [1914], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. i\n\n### \xe0\xa5\x90\n\n### FOREWORD\n\nFOR the first time it is, I believe, that the English translation of so many\nas 30 Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds is being put forth before the public in a collected form.\nAmong the Hin\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc5\xab Scriptures, the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das hold the pre-eminent place. The\nUpanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds which are culled from the \xc4\x80ra\xe1\xb9\x87yaka-portions of the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das--so-called\nbecause they were read in the Ara\xe1\xb9\x87ya (forest) after the learner had given up\nthe life of the world--are regarded as the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada, or the end or final crown\nof the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das. Ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada is also the end of all knowledge, since the word Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das\nmeans according to its derivation \'knowledge\'. Rightly were the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds so\nconsidered, since their knowledge led a person to \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, the goal of life. The\nother portion of the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das, _viz_., Samhi\xe1\xb9\xadas and Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87as, conferred upon a\nman, if he should conform to the requisite conditions, the mastery of the\nUniverse only which is certainly inferior to \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. It is these Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds that\nto the western philosopher Schopenhauer were the "solace of life".\n\nThere are now extant, in all, 108 Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds, of which the principal or major\n12 Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds commented upon by \xc5\x9ari \xc5\x9aa\xe1\xb9\x85kar\xc4\x81ch\xc4\x81rya and others were translated\ninto English by Dr. Roer and R\xc4\x81ja R\xc4\x81jen\xe1\xb8\x8dra L\xc4\x81l Mi\xe1\xb9\xadra and re-translated by Max\nMuller in his "Sacred Books of the East," together with one other Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d\ncalled _Mai \xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\xab_. Of the rest, 95 in number, two or three Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds have\nappeared in English up to now, but never so many as are here presented to the\npublic, so far as I am aware.\n\nMany years ago, the late Sun\xe1\xb8\x8dara \xc5\x9aastri, a good Sanscrit Scholar and myself\nworked together to put into English garb the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds that had not been\nattempted before, and\n\np. ii\n\nsucceeded in publishing most of those which are here gathered in the monthly\nissues of _The Theosophist_. The Karmic agents willed that my late co-worker\nshould abandon his physical garment at a premature age. Then I resolved upon\nthrowing up my worldly business of pleading the cause of clients before the\nbench for that of pleading the cause of God before the public. The incessant\ntravel in that cause since then for over 18 years from place to place in all\nparts of India left me no leisure until now to republish all the above\ntranslations in a book form. But when this year a little rest was afforded me,\nI was able to revise them as well as add a few more. I am conscious of the\nmany faults from which this book suffers and have no other hope in it than\nthat it will serve as a piece of pioneer work, which may induce real Yogins\nand scholars to come into the field and bring out a better translation.\n\nThere are many editions of the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds to be found in Calcutta, Bombay,\nPoona, South India and other places. But we found that the South Indian\neditions, which were nearly the same in Telugu or Gran\xe1\xb9\xadha characters, were in\nmany cases fuller and more intelligible and significant. Hence we adopted for\nour translation South Indian editions. The edition of the 108 Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds which\nthe late Tukaram Tatya of Bombay has published in \xe1\xb8\x8cevan\xc4\x81gari characters\napproaches the South Indian edition. As the South Indian edition of the\nUpanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds is not available for the study of all, I intend to have the\nrecensions of that edition printed in \xe1\xb8\x8cevan\xc4\x81gari characters, so that even\nthose that have a little knowledge of Sanscrit may be able to follow the\noriginal with the help of this translation.\n\n_Transliteration_\n\nIn the transliteration of Sanscrit letters into the English alphabet certain\ndifficulties present themselves. Let me take first the letter #. There are\nthree letters in Sanscrit #, #, and #. They are differently pronounced and one\nshould not be confounded with another. For the first letter we have the\nEnglish equivalent _S_ and for the last _Sh_. But for the second one we\n\np. iii\n\nhave none whatsoever. The prominent writers in the field of Theosophy have\nbeen transliterating this letter into _Sh_. Hence in writing the word ### they\nmade it _K \xc4\x81shi_ in the English language. They utter it also in the same\nmanner. To a South Indian ear, it is rather grating. The man\xe1\xb9\xadras especially\ndepend for their efficacy upon proper pronunciation. When we therefore utter\nthe words wrongly, there is committed according to Sanscrit writers, Var\xe1\xb9\x87a-\nHa\xe1\xb9\xady\xc4\x81-\xe1\xb8\x8cosha or the sin of the murder of letters or words. In my translation I\nhave represented the letter # by \xc5\x9a and not by _Sh_ , since I consider the\nlatter to be a mistake. Other transliterations are:--\n\n![](img/_00300.jpg)\n\nIt would be well if our leaders of thought conferred together and came to some\nagreement upon the question of transliteration.\n\n_The Order of the Upanisha \xe1\xb8\x8ds_\n\nThe Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds translated have been classified under the headings of (1)\nVe\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada, (2) Physiology, (3) Man\xe1\xb9\xadra, (4) Sanny\xc4\x81sa and (5) Yoga. But these are\nnot hard and fast divisions. For instance in the Sanny\xc4\x81sa and Yoga Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds,\nman\xe1\xb9\xadras also are given. But in the Man\xe1\xb9\xadric Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds, Man\xe1\xb9\xadras alone are\ngiven.\n\n_Ve \xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada and Yoga Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds_\n\nThe Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds that come under the headings of Ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada and Yoga are the most\nimportant. But it is the latter Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds that are most occult in their\ncharacter, since it is they that give clues to the mysterious forces located\nin nature and man, as well as to the ways by which they maybe conquered. With\nreference to Ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada, the ancient teachers thereof have rightly ordained that\nnone has the right to enter upon a study of it, unless he has mastered to a\nslight degree at least the S\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhana-Cha\xe1\xb9\xadushtaya, or four means of salvation. He\nshould not, only be convinced in theory of the fact that \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81\n\np. iv\n\nis the only Reality, and all else are but the ephemeral things of the world,\nbut he should also have outgrown in practice the craving for such transitory\nworldly things: besides he should have developed a fair mastery over the body\nand the mind. A non-compliance with these precedent conditions leads men into\nmany anomalies. The orthodox and the clever without any practice are placed in\na bad predicament through a study of these Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds. In such Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds as\n_Mai \xe1\xb9\xadreya_ and others, pilgrimages to holy places, the rituals of the Hin\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc5\xabs,\nceremonial impurities at the time of birth and death, Man\xe1\xb9\xadras, etc., are made\nlight of. To the orthodox that are blind and strict observers of rites and\nceremonies, statements like these give a rude shock. Hence Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds are not\nmeant for persons of this stamp. Nor are they intended tor mere intellectual\npeople who have no knowledge of practice about them, and are immersed in the\nthings of the world. Some of us are aware of the manner in which men with\nbrains alone have made a travesty of the doctrine of M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81. Not a few clever\nbut unprincipled persons actually endeavour to justify arguments of all kinds\nof dissipations and wrong conduct by the assertion that it is all M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81. The\nold \xe1\xb9\x9ashis were fully aware of the fact that Ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada would be desecrated by\nthose that had not complied with its precedent conditions. Only when the\ndesires and the self are overcome and the heart is made pure, or as\nUpanisha\xe1\xb8\x8dic writers put it, the heart-knot is broken, only then the \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 in\nthe heart will be truly realised: and then it is that the \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 in all universe\nis realised also, the universe being then seen as M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81. But so long as the\n\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 in the heart is not realised through living the life, the universe will\nnot be realised as M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81, and "God everywhere" will be but in words.\n\nOne special point worthy of notice in the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds is that all the knowledge\nbearing upon a subject is not put forward in one and the same place. We have\nto wade through a mass of materials and a number of Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds, ere we can\nhave a connected view of a subject. In modern days when \'a subject is taken\nup, all the available information is given in one place in a systematic\nmanner. But not so in the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds.\n\np. v\n\n[paragraph continues] Take the subject of Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as which refer to life itself.\nIn one Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d, one piece of information is given, another in another and so\non. And unless we read them all together and reconcile the seemingly\ndiscrepant statements, we cannot have a complete and clear knowledge of the\nsubject. This process was adopted by the \xe1\xb9\x9ashis, probably because they wanted\nto draw out thereby the intellectual and spiritual faculties latent in the\ndisciple, and not to make him a mere automaton. In these days when knowledge\nis presented in a well-assimilated form, it is no doubt taken up easily but it\ndoes not evoke the latent reasoning power so much. When therefore the disciple\nwent in the ancient days to the teacher for the solution of a difficulty,\nhaving been unable to find it himself after hard thinking, it was understood\neasily and permanently because of the previous preparation of the mind, and\nwas also reverently appreciated as a boon and godsend, because of the\ndifficulty previously experienced. The function of the teacher was not only to\nexplain the difficult points to the taught, but also to make him realise those\nthings of which understanding was sought. As an illustration, we might take\nthe case of the soul. The Guru not only explained the difficult passages or\npoints relating to the soul, but also made the disciple leave the body or\nbodies and realise himself as the soul. As we cannot get such Gurus in the\nouter world nowadays, the only thing left to do instead is to secure the\npublication of simple treatises on matters of Ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada and Yoga for the benefit\nof the public. I hope, I shall before long be able to make a start in this\ndirection.\n\nIn studying the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds on Ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada and Yoga, we find certain peculiarities\nwhich throw a light on their greatness. Both of them lay stress upon certain\ncentres in the human body for development. The 12 major Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds as well as\nthe Ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds herein published deal with the heart and the heart\nalone; while the Yoga Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds treat of many centres including the heart.\nFor the purpose of simplification, all the centres may be divided under the\nmain headings of head, heart and the portion of the body from the navel\ndownwards.\n\np. vi\n\nBut why? The key which will unlock these secrets seems to be this. All\nreligions postulate that the real man is the soul, and that the soul has to\nreach God. Christianity states that God created the soul in His own image and\nthat the soul has to rise to the full stature of God in order to reach Him.\nHinduism says that J\xc4\xabv\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 (the human soul) is an Am\xc5\x9ba or portion of\nParam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, or God, which is to eventually unfold the powers of God, and\ncompares it with a ray of the sun of God, or a spark out of the fire of God.\nIn all religions, there is an unanimity of opinion that the soul is a likeness\nof God, having God\'s powers in latency to be unfolded hereafter. Let us\ntherefore first understand the attributes of God. He is said to have\nomnipresence, omniscience and omnipotence. Hin\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc5\xabism translates these ideas\ninto Sa\xe1\xb9\xad, Chi\xe1\xb9\xad and \xc4\x80nan\xe1\xb8\x8da. They are eternal existence, infinite knowledge, and\nunlimited power. The soul identifying itself with the body thinks it lives for\nthe life-term of the body only; cooped up by the brain, it imagines, it has\nonly the knowledge circumscribed by the brain; carried away by the pleasures\nof the senses, it whirls about in the midst of them as if they constituted the\nReal Bliss. But when it wakes up from the dream of the lower things of the\nbody and glances upwards to the higher world of Spirit, it discovers its\ndelusions and finds itself to be of the same nature as the God above, who is\neternal, all-knowing and all-powerful. And this discovery has to be made by\neach soul in the human body, in which it is functioning, through the three\nmain centres of head, heart and navel. Through the heart, it cuts the heart-\nknot and realises its all-pervading character when it realises its eternity of\nexistence; through the brain, it rises beyond it through its highest seat,\n_viz_., Sahasr\xc4\x81ra which corresponds to the pineal gland in the physical body,\nand obtains its omniscience; through the navel, according to the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds--\nit obtains a mastery over that mysterious force called Ku\xe1\xb9\x87dalin\xc4\xab which is\nlocated therein, and which confers upon it an unlimited power--that force\nbeing mastered only when a man arises above K\xc4\x81ma or passion. Psychologists\ntell us that desires when conquered lead to the development of will. When will\nis developed to a great degree,\n\np. vii\n\nnaturally great power, or omnipotence, ensues: our statement is that Ku\xe1\xb9\x87dalin\xc4\xab\nwhen conquered leads to unlimited powers and perfections, or Si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhis like\nA\xe1\xb9\x87im\xc4\x81, etc., and that Ku\xe1\xb9\x87dalin\xc4\xab can only be conquered through rising above the\ndesires of the senses.\n\nFrom the foregoing it is clear that the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds are intended only\nfor those devotees of God that want to have a development of the heart mainly,\nand not of the brain and the navel, and that the Yogic Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds are intended\nfor those that want to have an all-round development of the soul in its three\naspects. Here I may remark that \xc5\x9ari \xc5\x9aa\xe1\xb9\x85kar\xc4\x81ch\xc4\x81rya and other commentators\ncommented upon the 12 Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds only, since other Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds treating of\nKu\xe1\xb9\x87dalin\xc4\xab, etc., are of an occult character and not meant for all, but only\nfor the select few who are fit for private initiation. If they had proceeded\nto comment upon the minor Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds also, they would have had to disclose\ncertain secrets which confer powers and which are not meant, therefore, for\nall. It would be nothing but fatal to the community, were the secrets leading\nto the acquisition of such powers imparted indiscriminately to all. In the\ncase of dynamite, the criminal using it may be traced, since it is of a\nphysical nature, but in the case of the use of the higher powers, they are set\nin motion through the will, and can never be traced through ordinary means.\nTherefore in the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d called _Yoga-Ku \xe1\xb9\x87dalin\xc4\xab_, the final truths that\nlead to the realisation of the higher powers are said to be imparted by the\nGuru alone to the disciple who has proved himself worthy after a series of\nbirths and trials.\n\nIn order to expound the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds, especially those that bear upon Yoga, some\none who is a specialist in Yoga--better still, if he is an Adept--should\nundertake the task of editing and translating them. The passages in Yoga\nUpanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds are very mystic sometimes; sometimes there is no nominative or\nverb, and we have to fill up the ellipses as best as we can.\n\nOne more remark may be made with reference to the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds. Each Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d\nis said to belong to one of the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das. Even if we take the 12 Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds\nedited by Max Muller and others, we find some of them are to be found in the\nexisting\n\np. viii\n\n[paragraph continues] Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das and others not. Why is this? In my opinion this\nbut corroborates the statement made by the Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u-Pur\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a about the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das. It\nsays that at the end of each \xe1\xb8\x8cw\xc4\x81para Yuga, a Ve\xe1\xb8\x8da-Vy\xc4\x81sa, or compiler of the\nVe\xe1\xb8\x8das, incarnates as an Ava\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81ra of Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u--a minor one--to compile the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das.\nIn the Yugas preceding the Kali Yuga we are in, the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das were "one" alone\nthough voluminous. Just before this Kali Yuga began, K\xe1\xb9\x9bsh\xe1\xb9\x87a-\xe1\xb8\x8cwaip\xc4\x81yana Ve\xe1\xb8\x8da-\nVy\xc4\x81sa incarnated, and, after withdrawing the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das that were not fit for this\nYoga and the short-lived people therein, made with the aid of his disciples a\ndivision of the remaining portions into four. Hence perhaps we are unable to\ntrace the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das of which some of the extant Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds form part.\n\nK. Narayanaswami\n\nAdyar, _March_ 1914.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 1.
