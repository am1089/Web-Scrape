I will now relate how Bulram, the\nabode of happiness, the receptacle of beauty, killed the monkey, Doobid,\nlisten with attention. One day Doobid, who was the minister of Soogreet, and\nbrother of the monkey Mindree, and the friend of Bhomasoor began to say,\n"There is a thorn in my mind, which always pains me." On hearing this, some\none enquired, "What is it?" He replied, "I will kill him, who has destroyed my\nfriend Bhomasoor, in order that the grief of my mind may depart."\n\nO great king! having thus spoken, he went, on one occasion, in great wrath, to\nthe city of Dwarka, laying waste the country of Shree Krishnu. Chund, and\nharassing the people. He set some afloat by pouring down rain, he sent down\nflames and burnt others, some he knocked down with a hill, he dashed hills\nupon others, some he drowned in the sea, he bound others, and hid them in\ncaves, he ripped open the bellies of some, some he killed with uprooted trees.\nHe thus constantly vexed the people; and wherever he found sages, holy men and\ngods sitting, he poured down upon them dung, urine and blood, thus afflicting\nand oppressing the people, he went at length to the city of Dwarka; and\nassuming a very small form, sat on the palace of Shree Krishnu. Chund. On\nseeing\n\np. 342\n\nhim, Krishnu\'s wives, shutting all the inner doors, ran off and hid\nthemselves; he, then having obtained intelligence of Bulram, ascended the hill\nKewut, thinking to himself, "I will first kill Bulram, and afterwards destroy\nKrishnu\'s life." At the place, where Buldeo Jee was diverting himself with his\nwives, Doobid, O great king! who was concealed, saw that Bulram had been\ndrinking, and that he had taken all his wives with him into the middle of a\ntank, and was engaged in various sports with them, and singing and bathing. On\nwitnessing this scene Doobid climbed up a tree and chattering, and uttering\nangry cries, began to leap and jump about the branches, and play all kinds of\ntricks; and defile a water-pot, filled with spirituous liquor, and the clothes\nof all of them which were lying about. On seeing the monkey the women were\nfrightened, and exclaimed, "O great king! whence has this monkey come, who has\nfrightened us, and defiled all our dresses?" When Buldeo heard this speech, he\ncame out of the tank, and laughingly threw a clod of earth at the monkey, who\nsupposing him to be intoxicated, came down from the tree, chattering and\nenraged; he first upset the contents of the large earthen vessel, filled with\nspirituous liquor, which was placed on the bank of the tank, and tore all the\nclothes into strips. Bulram Jee was then angry, and poised in his hand his\nplough and pestle, and the monkey becoming as large as a hill, came in front\nof Bulram, prepared to fight. Buldeo brought into play his plough and pestle,\nand the monkey hurled trees and hills. They both closed and had a fierce\nencounter, and neither moved back at all from his position.\n\nO great king! these two mighty beings were contending resolutely with each\nother, and practising all kinds of feints and stratagems; but the spectators\nwere ready to die of fright; at length Bulram perceiving that they were all\ndistressed, threw down and killed Doobid. Gods, men and sages were all\nrejoiced at his death, and their griefs were dispelled; the delighted gods\nrained flowers and raised shouts of victory for Bulram.\n\np. 343\n\nHaving recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great\nking! that monkey had existed since the Treta age, which Buldeo Jee killed and\nreleased from existence. Bulram, the abode of happiness, having gratified them\nall, brought them with him thence to the city of Dwarka, and related all the\ncircumstances of the destruction of Doobid to the descendants of Judoo.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LXIX](psa70.htm)\n\n'
