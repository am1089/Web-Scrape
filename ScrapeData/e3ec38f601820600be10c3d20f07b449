If it be said that (the formation of aggregates may be explained) through\n(Nescience, &c.) standing in the relation of mutual causality; we say 'No,'\nbecause they merely are the efficient causes of the origin (of the immediately\nsubsequent links).\n\nAlthough there exists no permanent intelligent principle of the nature either\nof a ruling Lord or an enjoying soul, under whose influence the formation of\naggregates could take place, yet the course of mundane existence is rendered\npossible through the mutual causality 1 of Nescience and so on, so that we\nneed not look for any other combining principle.\n\nThe series beginning with Nescience comprises the following members:\nNescience, impression, knowledge, name and form, the abode of the six, touch,\nfeeling, desire, activity, birth, species, decay, death, grief, lamentation,\npain, mental affliction, and the like 2. All these terms constitute\n\np. 405\n\na chain of causes and are as such spoken of in the Bauddha system, sometimes\ncursorily, sometimes at length. They are, moreover, all acknowledged as\nexisting, not by the Bauddhas only, but by the followers of all systems. And\nas the cycles of Nescience, &c. forming uninterrupted chains of causes and\neffects revolve unceasingly like water-wheels, the existence of the aggregates\n(which constitute bodies and minds) must needs be assumed, as without such\nNescience and so on could not take place.\n\nThis argumentation of the Bauddha we are unable to accept, because it merely\nassigns efficient causes for the origination of the members of the series, but\ndoes not intimate an efficient cause for the formation of the aggregates. If\nthe Bauddha reminds us of the statement made above that the existence of\naggregates must needs be inferred from the existence of Nescience and so on,\nwe point out that, if he means thereby that Nescience and so on cannot exist\nwithout aggregates and hence require the existence of such, it remains to\nassign an efficient cause for the formation of the aggregates. But, as we have\nalready shown--when examining the Vai _s_ eshika doctrine--that the formation\nof aggregates cannot be accounted for even on the assumption of permanent\natoms and individual souls in\n\np. 406\n\nwhich the ad _ri_ sh _t_ a abides  1; how much less then are aggregates\npossible if there exist only momentary atoms not connected with enjoying souls\nand devoid of abodes (i.e. souls), and that which abides in them (the ad _ri_\nsh _t_ a).--Let us then assume (the Bauddha says) that Nescience, &c.\nthemselves are the efficient cause of the aggregate.--But how--we ask--can\nthey be the cause of that without which--as their abode--they themselves are\nnot capable of existence? Perhaps you will say that in the eternal sa _m_ sara\nthe aggregates succeed one another in an unbroken chain, and hence also\nNescience, and so on, which abide in those aggregates. But in that case you\nwill have to assume either that each aggregate necessarily produces another\naggregate of the same kind, or that, without any settled rule, it may produce\neither a like or an unlike one. In the former case a human body could never\npass over into that of a god or an animal or a being of the infernal regions;\nin the latter case a man might in an instant be turned into an elephant or a\ngod and again become a man; either of which consequences would be contrary to\nyour system.--Moreover, that for the purpose of whose enjoyment the aggregate\nis formed is, according to your doctrine, not a permanent enjoying soul, so\nthat enjoyment subserves itself merely and cannot be desired by anything else;\nhence final release also must, according to you, be considered as subserving\nitself\n\np. 407\n\nonly, and no being desirous of release can be assumed. If a being desirous of\nboth were assumed, it would have to be conceived as permanently existing up to\nthe time of enjoyment and release, and that would be contrary to your doctrine\nof general impermanency.--There may therefore exist a causal relation between\nthe members of the series consisting of Nescience, &c., but, in the absence of\na permanent enjoying soul, it is impossible to establish on that ground the\nexistence of aggregates.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[404:1](sbe34195.htm#fr_394) The kara _n_ atvat of _S_ a _n_ kara explains the\npratyayatvat of the Sutra; karya _m_ praty ayate _g_ anakatvena ga _kkh_ ati.\n\n[404:2](sbe34195.htm#fr_395) The commentators agree on the whole in their\nexplanations of the terms of this series.--The following is the substance of\nthe comment of the Brahmavidyabhara _n_ a: Nescience is the error of\nconsidering that which is momentary, impure, &c. to be permanent, pure, &c.--\nImpression (affection, sa _m_ skara) comprises desire, aversion, &c., and the\nactivity caused by them.--Knowledge (vi _g \xc3\xb1_ana) is the self-consciousness\n(aham ity alayavi _g \xc3\xb1_anasya v _ri_ ttilabha _h_ ) springing up in the\nembryo.--Name and form is the rudimentary flake--or bubble-like condition of\nthe embryo.--The p. 405 abode of the six (sha _d_ ayatana) is the further\ndeveloped stage of the embryo in which the latter is the abode of the six\nsenses.--Touch (spar _s_ a) is the sensations of cold, warmth, &c. on the\nembryo's part.--Feeling (vedana) the sensations of pleasure and pain resulting\ntherefrom.--Desire (t _ri_ sh _n_ a) is the wish to enjoy the pleasurable\nsensations and to shun the painful ones.--Activity (upadana) is the effort\nresulting from desire,--Birth is the passing out from the uterus--Species (\n_g_ ati) is the class of beings to which the new-born creature belongs.--Decay\n( _g_ ara).--Death (mara _n_ am) is explained as the condition of the creature\nwhen about to die (mumursha).--Grief ( _s_ oka) the frustration of wishes\nconnected therewith.--Lament (paridevanam) the lamentations on that account.--\nPain (du _h_ kha) is such pain as caused by the five senses.--Durmanas is\nmental affliction.--The 'and the like' implies death, the departure to another\nworld and the subsequent return from there.\n\n[406:1](sbe34195.htm#fr_396) \xc3\x82nanda Giri and Go. \xc3\x82nanda explain: \xc3\x82 _s_ raya\n_s_ rayibhuteshv iti bhokt _ri_ vi _s_ esha _n_ am ad _ri_ sh _t_ a _s_\nrayeshv ity artha _h_.--The Brahma-vidyabhara _n_ a says: Nityeshv a _s_ raya\n_s_ rayibhuteshv a _n_ ushv abhyupagamyamaneshu bhokt _ri_ shu _k_ a satsv ity\nanvaya _h_. \xc3\x82 _s_ raya _s_ rayibhuteshv ity asyopakaryopakarakabhavaprapteshv\nity artha _h_.--And with regard to the subsequent a _s_ raya _s_ rayi _s_\nunyeshu: a _s_ raya _s_ rayitva _s_ unyeshu, aya _m_ bhava _h_ , sthireshu\nparama _n_ ushu yadanvaye parama _n_ una _m_ sa _m_ ghatapatti _h_\nyadvyatireke _k_ a na tad upakarakam upakarya _h_ parama _n_ ava _h_ yena tatk\n_ri_ to bhoga _h_ prarthyate sa tatra karteti grahitu _m_ _s_ akyate, ksha _n_\nikeshu tu parama _n_ ushu anvayavyatirekagrahasyanekaksha _n_ asadhyasyasa _m_\nbhavan nopakaryopakarakabhavo nirdharayitu _m_ _s_ akya _h_.--\xc3\x82nanda Giri\nremarks on the latter: Ad _ri_ sh _t_ a _s_ rayakart _ri_ rahityam aha _s_\nrayeti.
