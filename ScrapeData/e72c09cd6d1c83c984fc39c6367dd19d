Brahma the Destroyer.--As we saw, the Upanishads are full of\ncosmogonies inherited from Vedic religion; but apparently they have not yet\narrived at the belief in a periodical course of alternate creation,\nmaintenance, and dissolution of worlds which later became general in India.\nThe earlier texts several times describe Brahma or some cognate power as\nconsuming his creatures separately; but a collective destruction is nowhere\nmentioned in them. 1\n\nIn the later Ved\xc4\x81nta the theory of periodical cataclysms is formally accepted.\nAgain and again the universe is created, and after a time dissolved again into\nindiscrete potentiality; this cycle of birth and death is without beginning\nand\n\np. 50\n\nwithout end (\xc2\xa7 12). In the intervals between destruction and the following\ncreation the eternal Veda, with its Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87as and Upanishads, rests as a\npotential force in the thought of Brahma; and at the beginning of creation the\nideas contained in it serve as archetypes for the formation of all phenomena\nin the now emerging universe, and are revealed to inspired sages, its _karma-k\n\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8da_ or practical section (the four Vedas and the bulk of the Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87as) to\nguide men to ritual and consequent worldly welfare, its _jn \xc4\x81na-k\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8da_ or\ntheoretical section (chiefly the Upanishads) to teach them the true knowledge\nof Brahma.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[49:1](brk26.htm#fr_3) See especially B.A. I. ii. 1, Ch.
