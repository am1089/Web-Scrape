'Speech is better than a name. Speech makes us understand the _Ri_ g-veda,\nYa _g_ ur-veda, Sama-veda, and as the fourth the \xc3\x82tharvana, as the fifth the\nItihasa-pura _n_ a, the Veda of the Vedas, the Pitrya, the Ra _s_ i, the\nDaiva, the Nidhi, the Vakovakya, the Ekayana, the Deva-vidya, the Brahma-\nvidya, the Kshatra-vidya, the Nakshatra-vidya, the Sarpa and Deva _g_ ana-\nvidya; heaven, earth, air, ether, water, fire, gods, men, cattle, birds,\nherbs, trees, all beasts down to worms, midges, and ants; what is right and\nwhat is wrong; what is true and what is false; what is good and what is bad;\nwhat is pleasing and what is not pleasing. For if there were no speech,\nneither right nor wrong would be known 1, neither the true nor the false,\nneither the good nor the bad, neither the pleasant nor the unpleasant. Speech\nmakes us understand all this. Meditate on speech.\n\n2\\. 'He who meditates on speech as Brahman, is, as it were, lord and master as\nfar as speech reaches he who meditates on speech as Brahman.'\n\n'Sir, is there something better than speech\n\n'Yes, there is something better than speech.'\n\n'Sir, tell it me.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[111:1](sbe01136.htm#fr_304) The commentator explains vya _g_ \xc3\xb1apayishyat by\navi _g_ \xc3\xb1atam abhavishyat.
