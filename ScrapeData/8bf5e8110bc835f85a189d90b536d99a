When on a visit to Perundurai, now \xc4\x80vudaiy\xc4\x81rkoil\nin the Tanjore District, he suddenly and completely came under the influence\nof a Brahman religious teacher, who for him was the manifestation of the very\nGod Himself. Then and there he began to sing the "Sacred Utterance"\n(Tiruv\xc4\x81saham), and was named by his preceptor "Utterer of Jewels" (M\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87ikka\nV\xc4\x81sahar). Returning to Madura, he forsook his high office with all its\nrewards, to become a religious poet wandering without earthly attachments from\nshrine to shrine. The stories clustering around his religious experience can\nbe read by English readers in Dr. Pope\'s great edition of his work. We find\nhim practising austerities at Chidambaram, or miraculously giving the gift of\nspeech to the dumb daughter of the Ch\xc5\x8dl\xcc\xa4a king, or defeating in disputation a\nband of Buddhists from Ceylon, but of certain historical information about him\nwe have practically none. Even the question of the century in which he lived\nis a battleground of the antiquarians. Tradition places him in the fifth\ncentury, earlier than the writers of the D\xc4\x93v\xc4\x81ram;\n\np. 87\n\nbut the opinion of scholars seems to be converging on the view that he lived\nin the latter half of the ninth, or the first half of the tenth century of our\nera. Another of his works is the Tirukk\xc5\x8dvaiy\xc4\x81r, an erotic poem of four hundred\nstanzas. Among Tamil S\xcc\x81aivite writers none makes a stronger devotional appeal\nthan M\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87ikka V\xc4\x81sahar. There is a common Tamil saying that nothing can melt the\nheart of the man who is not melted by the Tiruv\xc4\x81saham.\n\np. 88 p. 89\n\nStanzas 80-92 are samples from an opening poem of one hundred stanzas, each\nten of which has its own metre and is fairly complete in itself. They fairly\nreflect the saint\'s varying moods. Notice the importance he attaches to\nemotion; his worst self-reproach is for feeling no frenzy. As to his\nconception of God, see how the word \'grace\' recurs in nearly every stanza. And\nyet that God of grace is called (in No. 84) both being and non-existence.\n\n##### The Hundred Verses\n\n80\\. Thrills and trembles my frame;  \nHands are lifted on high;  \nHere at Thy fragrant feet,  \nSobbing and weeping I cry;  \nFalsehood forsaking, I shout,  \n"Victory, victory, praise!  \nLord of my life, these clasped hands  \nWorship shall bring Thee always.\n\n81\\. Indra or Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u or Brahm,  \nTheir divine bliss crave not I;  \nI seek the love of Thy saints,  \nThough my house perish thereby.  \nTo the worst hell I will go,  \nSo but Thy grace be with me.  \nBest of all, how could my heart  \nThink of a god beside Thee?\n\n82\\. Though like Thy saints I seem, \'tis but the acting of a part.  \nYet wondrous swift I run to reach the heaven where Thou art.  \nO hill of gold and precious gems, grant in Thy grace to me  \nA heart to melt, lord of my life, in ceaseless love to Thee.\n\np. 90 p. 91\n\n83\\. I have no fear of births, but quake at thought that I must die.  \nE\'en heav\'n to me were naught; for earth\'s whole empire what care I?  \nO S\xcc\x81iva wreathed with honeyed blossoms, "When shall come the morn  \nWhen Thou wilt grant Thy grace to me?" I cry with anguish torn.\n\n84\\. The sky, earth, wind, the light, our very flesh and life art Thou,  \nBeing art Thou, non-being too, Thou king, who see\'st how  \nMen dance like puppets with their foolish thoughts of \'I\' and \'Mine,\'  \nWhile Thou the cords dost pull. What words can tell Thy praise divine?\n\n85\\. At sound of cries like this, "O Bull-rider whose spreading hair  \nThe falling stream receives! "Heaven\'s Lord," true devotees there were,  \nWhose love-thrilled heart broke forth, like stopped-up rivers rushing down.  \nYet Thou didst choose no one of them, but me to be Thine own.  \nAnd yet my body will not turn from heel to head one heart  \nTo melt in love for Thee, one eye to shed the tears that smart  \nIn swelling floods. Ah! wretched that I am, who only moan!  \nMy two eyes are unfeeling wood, my heart a great dead stone!\n\np. 92 p. 93\n\n86\\. Amid the fruits of deeds I lay. Thou didst thyself reveal  \nWith words of comfort saying "Come, I will destruction deal  \nTo evil fruit of deeds," and thus thou mad\'st me all Thy slave.  \nAnd yet I stand as if a statue made of steel, nor rave,  \nNor sing, nor cry, nor wail--woe\'s me--nor in my spirit faint  \nWith deep desire, so dull am I. O being ancient,  \nThou art beginning, Thou art end: tell me, how can I be  \nSo dead at heart? The end if this I do not dare to see.\n\n* * *\n\n87\\. Him though men seek, none fully know; in Him no evil is.  \nNone are His kindred; knowledge perfect, effortless is His.  \nA cur am I, yet He hath giv\'n to me in sight of men  \nA place on earth, and shewed me things far beyond mortal ken.  \nHe told me what no ears can hear; from future births He sav\'d.  \nSuch magic wrought my Lord who me hath lovingly enslaved.\n\n88\\. Our God of gods, whom e\'en the devas\' king knows but in part,  \nRuleth the three who in the fair world-gardens life impart,  \nAnd life maintain, and life destroy; our First, Reality,  \nFather of old, whose consort Um\xc4\x81 is, our sovereign, He p. 94 p. 95  \nCame down in grace and made e\'en me to be His very own.  \nHenceforth before no man I bow; I fear but Him alone.  \nNow of His servants\' servants I have joined the sacred throng,  \nAnd ever more and more I\'ll bathe in bliss. with dance and song.\n\n89\\. The meanest cur am I; I know not how to do the right;  \n\'Twere but what I deserve, should\'st Thou my wickedness requite  \nWith the dread fate of those who never saw Thy flowery feet;  \nFor though mine eyes have seen, my ears have heard saints guileless, meet,  \nWho reached Thy fragrant presence, yet I stay, for false am I,  \nFit for naught save to eat and dress, Lion of victory.\n\n* * *\n\n90\\. None but myself has sunk myself. Thy name be ever praised!  \nNo blame lay I on Thee, lauds to my Master be upraised!  \nYet to forgive is aye a mark of greatness. Praise to Thee!  \nLord of the land celestial, Praise! O end this life for me.\n\np. 96 p. 97\n\n91\\. The fawn-eyed maid is part of Thee! From holy writ Thou\'rt hid!  \nThou\'rt honey, yea ambrosia, by man\'s mind not compassed.  \nO king who bearest with my faults, some harsh words did I say.  \nThy saints have entered heaven. Without, falsehood and I still stay.\n\n92\\. Since I am false, and false my heart, and false my very love,  \nHowe\'er I weep, still held by deed can I reach Thee above?  \nO honey, nectar, O essential sweetness, great as sweet,  \nGrant grace to me to find the path that leads unto Thy feet.\n\n93\\. Heav\'n, earth, and all that therein is, thou makest without seed.  \nThou dost preserve and Thou destroy. \'Tis Thou who hast decreed  \nThat I though treacherous, mean, should be a man who frenzied faints  \nBefore Thy temple gates, one with the band of Thy true saints.  \nWhat men themselves have planted, e\'en a poisonous mango tree,  \nThey root not up. O Lord of mine, as such a tree keep me.\n\n* * *\n\nOur next five stanzas, taken from a hymn of fifty, are full of the pathos\nexpressed in the title, which is a refrain recurring in every verse. Only\nflashes of the light of the presence of God pierce the prevailing gloom. The\nsaint cannot free himself from sensuality,\n\np. 98 p. 99\n\neven while he hates it. He wonders whether even the God who drank poison for\nothers\' sake will leave him alone.\n\n##### Wilt Thou Leave Me?\n\n94\\. Mingling in grace with me, O rider of the bull, Thou mad\'st me Thine.  \n  But wilt Thou leave me? Thou whose form in the fierce tiger\'s skin is clad,  \nUttarak\xc5\x8dsama\xe1\xb9\x85gai old has Thee for king. O lord of mine  \n  With matted hair, hold Thou me up; for I am weary grown and sad.\n\n95\\. Set in the marge of flowing stream that eats its banks away, the tree  \n  Shakes to its fall; and thus am I, my sense bewitch\'d by maids\' dark eyes.  \nUttarak\xc5\x8dsama\xe1\xb9\x85gai\'s king, spouse of gem-vested P\xc4\x81rvati,  \n  Who dwell\'st in \xc4\x80r\xc5\xabr holy, O protector, for my help arise.\n\n96\\. In ignorance I spurned thy grace. Dost Thou, my gem, now me despise,  \n  And wilt thou leave me? O destroy my sum of deeds and make me thine.  \nUttarak\xc5\x8dsama\xe1\xb9\x85gai\'s king, \'tis surely true, the great and wise,  \n  When only little curs play false, to mercy ever will incline.\n\np. 100 p. 101\n\n97\\. With none to cheer me from my fear, far have I wandered wearily,  \n  O Lightning-like, and wilt Thou leave me? If I truly thee compare,  \nUttarak\xc5\x8dsama\xe1\xb9\x85gai\'s king, I find naught else resembling Thee;  \n  But a true father, mother dear art Thou to me, my treasure rare.\n\n98\\. Whether I praise or curse Thee, still I\'m stained with sin and sorrowing.  \n  Yet, wilt Thou leave me? Splendour shining like the red-hued coral mount,  \nMaster, thou drankest poison black, the humbler beings pitying,  \n  That I, Thy meanest one, might find no poison, but a nectar fount.\n\n* * *\n\nOur poet made songs which maidens might sing in their rhythmical games, or as\nthey sat at the grinding-stone. In India the boatman sings as he rows, the\nryot sings as he draws from the well, the sepoy sings on his march. A feature\nof such songs is the refrain, which is usually a mere collection of euphonic\nsyllables, though it may have a meaning. Here are specimens of a few songs\nintended for women. The refrain of the first, "\xc4\x92l\xc5\x8dremb\xc4\x81v\xc4\x81y" probably means\n"Receive and ponder what I say, O lady." The Grinding song, strangely enough,\nis used at funerals, as also is the \'Antiphony.\' The song of \'The Three\nCastles\' Destruction\' is supposed to accompany play with a ball or a kind of\nshuttle called \'und\xc4\xab.\' For the legend of the Three Castles, see page\n[7](htss02.htm#page_7). \'The Shoulder-Play\' is for some ancient game in which\nwomen grasped each other\'s shoulders.\n\np. 102 p. 103\n\n##### Song of the Maidens\n\n99\\. Older are Thou than the oldest of all,  \nNewest of all that is new.  \nAt Thy saints\' feet we in service will fall,  \nWe are Thy handmaidens true.  \nNone but Thy bondsmen shall call us their own;  \nLord, we would none others wed;  \nWe would be slaves at their bidding alone:  \nSo be our bliss perfected.  \n\xc4\x92l\xc5\x8dremb\xc4\x81v\xc4\x81y.\n\n100\\. "Sure for Thy child there is refuge with Thee,"  \nTrembling we take up the cry.  \nHear, O our Lord, while we bring Thee one plea,  \nGrant but one boon for our joy.  \nMay only Thy lovers rest on our breast,  \nLet our hands\' labour be theirs.  \nOnly on such our eyes night and day rest,  \nThen sun rise west, east, who cares?  \n\xc4\x92l\xc5\x8dremb\xc4\x81v\xc4\x81y.\n\n##### The Grinding Song\n\n101\\. Grind we the powder gold, that He may bathe;  \nFor He is Scripture, He is sacrifice;  \nHe\'s being\'s truth, and being\'s falsehood too;  \nLight is He, yea, and He is darkness deep;  \nHe is deep sorrow, and true bliss is He;  \nHe is the half, and He again the whole;  \nBondage is He, but He is true release;  \nHe is the alpha, He the omega.\n\np. 104 p. 105\n\n##### S\xcc\x81iva\'s Mysteries (An Antiphony)\n\n102\\. "His form is smeared with ashes white; the snake His strange adornment\nis;  \nThe secret scriptures utters He: what kind of god, my friend, is this?  \n"Why talk of ash-smear, holy speech, adornment strange? This only know,  \nThis god, of every living thing is the true nature. Ch\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\xb7al\xc5\x8d."\n\n103\\. "My father and my master, He of all men Lord supreme, is clad  \nWith but a hanging loin-cloth stitched; pray tell me, friend, is He not mad?  \n"The Vedas four with meaning fraught, the everlasting S\xcc\x81\xc4\x81stras, know  \nThat these are but the threads whereof is wove His loin-cloth. Ch\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\xb7al\xc5\x8d."\n\n104\\. The burning-ground\'s His temple fine; the tiger\'s skin His raiment is;  \nFather or mother hath He none; He\'s all alone; my friend, see this.\'\'  \n"Though He no parents hath, no kin, yet should His anger kindle, lo,  \nThe whole wide world would straightway turn to dust and ashes. Ch\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\xb7al\xc5\x8d."\n\n105\\. "Though I am but a cur, yet when I turned to Him who hath no end,  \nInto a sea of bliss He made me sink o\'erwhelmed; see this, my friend."  \n"Those holy feet that sank thee in the sea of bliss o\'erwhelmed, know,  \nE\'en to the very gods in heav\'n they\'re richest treasure. Ch\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\xb7al\xc5\x8d."\n\np. 106 p. 107\n\n##### The Three Castles\' Destruction\n\n106\\. Bent was the bow, begun the fight,  \nThe castles three were \'whelmed quite, (Fly, und\xc4\xab)  \nThree castles blazing with one light. (Fly, und\xc4\xab)\n\n107\\. One bolt in S\xcc\x81iva\'s hand saw we,  \nOne single bolt for castles three, (Fly, und\xc4\xab)  \nAnd e\'en that one scarce needed He. (Fly, und\xc4\xab)\n\n108\\. Cleft lay the car at His foot\'s tread,  \nThe axle was all shattered, (Fly, und\xc4\xab)  \nThree castles ruined lay and dead. (Fly, und\xc4\xab)\n\n##### The Shoulder-Play\n\n109\\. Poor slave was I, how long I poured out all my days for naught,  \n  To Him the all-supreme no homage rendering! Yet see,  \nHow He, the jewel from eternal ages incorrupt,  \n  Has come and drawn the prison-bolt of births, and set me free.  \n                         Play we T\xc5\x8d\xe1\xb9\x87\xc5\x8dkkam\n\n* * *\n\nIn the poetry of all lands lovers have appealed to birds to be their\nmessengers to the distant loved one. This is so common in Indian poetry as to\nhave become a recognised convention. Here the saint sends his message of love\nand devotion, in one case by a humming bee, in the other by the Indian cuckoo,\nto S\xcc\x81iva who dwells in Tillai, i.e. Chidambaram.\n\np. 108 p. 109\n\n##### The Bee\'s Message\n\n110\\. Hard-hearted thief, stiff-necked was I, but no such name He called me;  \nMy stony heart He melted, and by mercy He enthralled me.  \nThe swans abound in Tillai\'s lovely hall of gold, His dwelling.  \nFly, king of bees, at His gold anklets hum, my message telling.\n\n111\\. Cur though I am, my lord has set me His great glory singing;  \nTo me, the mad, His patient grace is aye forgiveness bringing;  \nScorning me not, He deigns to take the service I can do Him.  \nMother and God. Go, king of bees, hum thou my message to Him.\n\n112\\. Far would my heart and mind have gone from Him, but He compelled me,  \nThe lord with tangled locks, and His fair spouse, they saved and held me.  \nHe is the sky, the mighty sea, east, west, north, south, indwelling.  \nHis feet with honey drop. There, king of bees, my praise be telling.\n\n113\\. In this world\'s treasure false immersed lay I, and self-deceived,  \nHeld it for treasure true, but for His own He me received.  \nMy precious life itself is He, in Tillai\'s hall abiding.  \nGo, king of bees, at His red lotus feet my words confiding.\n\np. 110 p. 111\n\n##### The Cuckoo\'s Errand\n\n114\\. Hear, little cuckoo in the honey\'d orchard groves.  \nHeav\'n did He spurn; to save us men, to earth He calve,  \nBoundless in giving, reeking naught of flesh of mine,  \nEntered my mind, and there my very thought became.  \nHe, the alone, the spouse of her whose pure eye\'s ray  \nShames the gazelle in softness, call Him hither, pray.\n\n* * *\n\nOne of the little childishnesses involved in idolatry is that every morning\nwith solemn ceremony the idol must be wakened from his sleep, bathed, and\ndressed. Here is a song with which he is roused from slumber. But notice how\nsuccessfully our author has filled his poem with the fresh morning feeling,\nand the sights and sounds of the sudden break of the Indian dawn.\n\n##### The Idol\'s Awakening\n\n115\\. Hail to Thee, treasure rare,  \n  Source of all prosperity,  \nDawn has come, at Thy feet,  \n  Flowers themselves, fair flowers lay we.  \nPraising Thee, we await  \n  Smiles that blossom fair and sweet  \nIn Thy face, as we fall  \n  Prone adoring at Thy feet.\n\nS\xcc\x81iva, Lord, dweller in  \n  Perundu\xe1\xb9\x9bai, where expand  \nLotus flowers, petalled white,  \n  In the cool moist pasture land,  \nThou whose flag is the bull,  \n  Thou the Lord of all my ways,  \nNow O Lord of us all,  \n  From Thy couch rise in Thy grace.\n\np. 112 p. 113\n\n116\\. Now anigh Indra\'s East  \n  Draws the sun; dark flies apace  \nAt the dawn; and the sun  \n  Of the kindness in Thy face  \nRiseth high\'r, ever high\'r,  \n  As like fair flowers opening,  \nEyes unclose from their sleep,  \n  Eyes of Thee our beauteous king.\n\nHear how now clouds of bees  \n  Humming bright fill all the air.  \nS\xcc\x81iva, Lord, dweller in  \n  Holy Perundu\xe1\xb9\x9bai fair,  \nThou wilt come to bestow  \n  Favours rich, Oh shew Thy face!  \nMountain-joy, ocean-bliss,  \n  From Thy couch rise in Thy grace.\n\n117\\. Cocks now crow to the morn,  \n  While the cuckoos loudly call;  \nLittle birds sweetly sing,  \n  And the conch-shell sounds o\'er all;  \nLight of stars fades away  \n  Into common light of day;  \nDawn and sun come as one,  \n  Now to us, O God, display\n\nIn Thy love Thy twin feet,  \n  Gracious, decked with anklets rare.  \nS\xcc\x81iva, Lord, dweller in Holy Perundu\xe1\xb9\x9bai fair,  \n  Hard for all men to find,  \nYet to me Thou shewedst Thy face.  \n  Now O Lord of us all,  \nFrom Thy couch rise in Thy grace.\n\np. 114 p. 115\n\n118\\. On this side some men play  \n  Lutes and v\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\x87as sweet of sound;  \nOn that side some men chant  \n  Ancient \xe1\xb9\x9aik, their songs resound;  \nIn their hands some have brought  \n  Wreaths of many blossoms wove;  \nSome bow down, some men weep,  \n  Some men sway, o\'ercome by love;\n\nClasping hands o\'er their heads,  \n  Others stand with reverent air;  \nS\xcc\x81iva, Lord, dweller in  \n  Holy Perundu\xe1\xb9\x9bai fair,  \nEven me didst thou save;  \n  Sweet to me have been Thy ways.  \nNow, O Lord of us all,  \n  From Thy couch rise in Thy grace.\n\n* * *\n\nThe rest of our specimens of the \'Holy Utterances\' may be left to explain\nthemselves without comment, save for a single line of title. Where two or more\nstanzas are given from a poem, the title here given is a translation from the\nTamil.\n\n##### Only with Thee and Thy Saints!\n\n119\\. Our lady aye is in Thy heart,  \n  As Thou in hers; and if ye both  \nIn mine do dwell, grant me a part  \n  Among your slaves, O ever First.  \n    Unending lord, in Tillai\'s hall who dost abide,  \n    Let this deep yearning of my soul be satisfied.\n\np. 116 p. 117\n\n##### What Can I Give Thee?\n\n120\\. Thou gav\'st Thyself, Thou gained\'st me;  \n  Which did the better bargain drive?  \nBliss found I in infinity;  \n  But what didst Thou from me derive?  \nO S\xcc\x81iva,. Perundu\xe1\xb9\x9bai\'s God,  \n  My mind Thou tookest for Thy shrine:  \nMy very body\'s Thine abode:  \n  What can I give Thee, Lord, of mine?\n\n* * *\n\n##### Passion\'s Pain\n\n121\\. Caught am I in passion\'s snare from women\'s liquid eyes;  \n  Stabbed at heart, a cur. O wisdom\'s light, no aid I see.  \nOnly lord, whose lady\'s feet are softer than the down,  \n  How I long to hear Thy coral lips speak cheer to me.\n\n##### Longings For Death\n\n122\\. Our lord supreme, both earth and heav\'n indwelling,  \n  See how I have no other help but Thee.  \nThou king of S\xcc\x81iva\'s world, bright beyond telling,  \n  Dweller in Perundu\xe1\xb9\x9bai, look on me.  \nWho\'ll hear my cry, who list to my complaining,  \n  If Thou Thy grace deny, who saved\'st me?  \nI find in sea-girt earth no joy remaining.  \n  Now let Thy grace speak, bid me come to Thee.\n\np. 118 p. 119\n\n123\\. In Thee she dwells whose feet than down are softer;  \n  See how I have no other help but Thee.  \nThou king of S\xcc\x81iva\'s world, my gracious master,  \n  Dweller in Perundu\xe1\xb9\x9bai, look on me.  \nFear holds me; for, in dark confusion godless,  \n  I did forget the grace that saved me.  \nDog and deceitful am I. Life is joyless.  \n  Now let Thy grace speak, bid me come to Thee.\n\n124\\. In Thee she dwells whose ancient praise is faultless;  \n  See how I have no other help but Thee.  \nThou king of S`iva\'s world, the bright moon wearing,  \n  Dweller in Perundu\xe1\xb9\x9bai, look on me.  \nWhom save Thee could I worship with my praises?  \n  Can any other refuge give for me?  \nO Rider of the bull, my life is joyless.  \n  Now let Thy grace speak, bid me come to Thee.\n\n##### The Balancing of Deeds\n\n125\\. O lord of Perundu\xe1\xb9\x9bai, place of peace,  \n  To them who call Thy name, beyond compare  \nTrue joy art Thou. Thou mad\'st my woe to cease  \n  When good and ill deeds done were balanced fair.  \n    Then lest unwith\'ring seeds of birth should grow,  \n    In Kal\xcc\xa4ukun\xe1\xb8\x8du Thy fair self didst shew.\n\np. 120 p. 121\n\n##### Life\'s Consuming\n\n126\\. Myself I cannot understand, nor what is day nor night;  \nHe who both word and thought transcends has reft my senses quite,  \nHe who for bull has Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u, and in Perundu\xe1\xb9\x9bai dwells,  \nO Light supreme, in Br\xc4\x81hman guise has cast on me strange spells.\n\n127\\. I ask not fame, wealth, earth or heav\'n. No birth, no death for me.  \nNone will I touch who love not S\xcc\x81iva. Now \'tis mine to see  \nAbiding Perundu\xe1\xb9\x9bai, wear the King\'s foot as my crown;  \nNever will I leave this His shrine, nor let Him leave His own.\n\n128\\. Art Thou like honey on the branch too high for me to climb?  \nOr art Thou nectar ocean-churned? O Hara, King sublime,  \nIn Perundu\xe1\xb9\x9bai, circled with moist fields, I can set Thee  \nWith form ash-smeared, the spotless. Can I bear my ecstasy?\n\n129\\. Many in this great earth who live do penance; I alone  \nBearing this frame of flesh, a barren jungle-tree have grown.  \nDweller in Perundu\xe1\xb9\x9bai old where blooms the kondai tree,  \nMay I the sinner cry "Wilt Thou not grant Thyself to me"?\n\np. 122 p. 123\n\n##### Pious Fear\n\n130\\. I fear not serpents lurking smooth;  \nI fear no liars\' feigned truth;  \nBut when I see fools venturing  \nE\'en to the foot of Him our king,  \nOur three-eyed Lord with matted hair,  \nOf His great godhead unaware,  \nFools thinking other gods can be,  \nTerror such sight inspires in me.\n\n131\\. I fear no javelin\'s gory blade;  \nNor sidelong glance of bangled maid;  \nBut when I see men void of grace  \nDrinking no sweetness from the praise  \nOf my unchiselled Gem, whose dance  \nIn Tillai\'s hail is seen, whose glance  \nMelts men\'s whole frame in ecstasy  \nTerror such sight inspires in me.\n\n##### I Cling to Thee\n\n132\\. King of the heavenly ones! All-filling Excellence!  \nE\'en to vile me Thou Thy wonders hast shown;  \nBalm of true bliss, ending false earthly bliss of sense,  \nThou my whole household did\'st take for Thine own.  \nMeaning of holy writ! Wondrous Thy glory!  \nTrue wealth, our S\xcc\x81iva, to Thee, Lord, I cling.  \nNever to loose my hold, firmly I cling to Thee;  \nWhere canst Thou go, leaving me sorrowing?\n\np. 124 p. 125\n\n133\\. King of celestial ones, ever with bull for steed,  \nEvil am I, yet my riches art Thou;  \nLest I should rot in my foul flesh, and die indeed,  \nThou hast preserved me, and Thine am I now.  \nThou art our God; Thou of grace art a boundless sea,  \nSaved from my flesh, now to Thee, Lord, I cling.  \nNever to let Thee loose, firmly I cling to Thee;  \nWhere can\'st Thou go, leaving me sorrowing?\n\n134\\. Thou dids\'t come into my vile fleshly body,  \nE\'en as \'twere into some great golden shrine;  \nSoft\'ning and melting it all, Thou hast saved me,  \nLord condescending, Thou gem all divine!  \nSorrow and birth, death, all ties that deceived me,  \nThou did\'st remove, all my bonds severing;  \nTrue bliss, our kindly Light, firmly I cling to Thee;  \nWhere canst Thou go leaving me sorrowing?\n\n##### NAUGHT BUT THY LOVE\n\n135\\. I ask not kin, nor name, nor place,  \n  Nor learned men\'s society.  \nMen\'s lore for me no value has;  \n  Kutt\xc4\x81lam\'s lord, I come to Thee.  \nWilt thou one boon on me bestow,  \n  A heart to melt in longing sweet,  \nAs yearns o\'er new-horn calf the cow,  \n  In yearning for Thy sacred feet?\n\np. 126 p. 127\n\n##### Longing for Union\n\n136\\. I had no virtue, penance, knowledge, self-control. A doll to turn  \n  At others\' will I danced, whirled, fell. But me He filled in every limb  \nWith love\'s mad longing, and that I might climb there whence is no return,  \n  He shewed His beauty, made me His. Ah me, when shall I go to Him?\n\n##### The Wonder of Grace\n\n137\\. Fool\'s friend was I, none such may know  \n  The way of freedom; yet to me  \nHe shew\'d the path of love, that so  \n  Fruit of past deeds might ended be.  \n    Cleansing my mind so foul, He made me like a god.  \n    Ah who could win that which the Father hath bestowed?\n\n138\\. Thinking it right, sin\'s path I trod;  \n  But, so that I such paths might leave,  \nAnd find His grace, the dancing God,  \n  Who far beyond our thought doth live,  \n    O wonder passing great!--to me His dancing shewed.  \n    Ah who could win that which the Father hath bestowed?\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Appendix I.
