I do not deny that we should be justified in deriving that sense\nfrom the words of the Anukrama _n_ ika, but I cannot admit that my own\ninterpretation is untenable. As Saya _n_ a does not speak authoritatively on\nthe subject, I followed the authority of Sha _d_ guru _s_ ishya. This\ncommentator of the Anukrama _n_ ika says: atra _k_ a ab _g_ am ukthair ahim g\n_ri_ _n_ isha ity ardhar _k_ o\xe0\xa4\xbdb _g_ anamno a devasya stuti _h_ ; ma no\xe0\xa4\xbdhir\nbudhnya ity ardhar _k_ o\xe0\xa4\xbdhirbudhnyanamno devasya b. Another commentator says:\nab _g_ am ukthair ardhar _k_ o\xe0\xa4\xbdhi _h_ ; uttaro ma no\xe0\xa4\xbdhir ity ahir budhnya _h_.\nFrom this we learn that both commentators looked upon the Dvipadas as ardhar\n_k_ as or half-verses, and ascribed the whole of verse 16 to Ahir ab _g_ a _h_\n, the whole of verse 17 to Ahir budhnya _h_. It will be seen from an accurate\nexamination of Saya _n_ a's commentary on verse 17, that in the second\ninterpretation of the second half of verse 17, he labours to show that in this\nportion, too, Ahir budhnya _h_ may be considered as the deity.\n\nIt is perfectly right to say that the words of the Anukrama _n_ ika, ab _g_ am\nahe _h_ , signify that the verse beginning with ab _g_ am, belongs to Ahi. But\nthere was no misprint in my index. It will be seen that Sha _d_ guru _s_ ishya\ngoes even beyond me, and calls that deity simply Ab _g_ a, leaving out Ahi\naltogether, as understood. I was anxious to show the distinction between Ab\n_g_ a Ahi _h_ and Ahir Budhnya _h_ , as the deities of the two successive\nverses, and I did not expect that any reader could possibly misinterpret my\nentry c.\n\nWith regard to hymns 91 and 92 of the seventh Ma _n_ _d_ ala, it is true, that\nin the index I did not mention that certain verses in which two deities are\nmentioned (91, 2;\n\np. lxix\n\n[paragraph continues] 4-7; 92, 2), must be considered as addressed not to Vayu\nalone, but to Vayu and Indra. It will be seen from Saya _n_ a's introduction\nto hymn 90, that he, too, wrongly limits the sentence of the Anukrama _n_ ika,\naindrya _s_ _k_ a ya dvivadukta _h_ , to the fifth and following verses of\nhymn 90, and that he never alludes to this proviso again in his introductory\nremarks to hymn 91 and 92, though, of course, he explains the verses, in which\na dual occurs, as addressed to two deities, viz. Indra and Vayu. The same\nomission, whether intentional or unintentional, occurs in Sha _d_ guru _s_\nishya's commentary. The other commentary, however, assigns the verses of the\nthree hymns rightly. The subject has evidently been one that excited attention\nin very early days, for in the Aitareya-brahma _n_ a, V, 20, we actually find\nthat the word vam which occurs in hymn 90, 1, and which might be taken as a\ndual, though Saya _n_ a explains it as a singular, is changed into te a.\n\nIn hymn VII, 104, rakshoha _n_ au might certainly be added as an epithet of\nIndra-Somau, and Sha _d_ guru _s_ ishya clearly takes it in that sense. The\nAnukrama _n_ ika says: indrasoma pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ adhikaindrasoma _m_ rakshoghna _m_\nsapabhi _s_ apaprayam.\n\nIn hymn VIII, 67, it has been supposed that the readings Samada and Samada\ninstead of Sammada and Sammada were due to a misprint. This is not the case.\nThat I was aware of the other spelling of this name, viz. Sammada and Sammada,\nI had shown in my History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature (2nd ed.), p. 39,\nwhere I had translated the passage of the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-sutras in which Matsya\nSammada occurs, and had also called attention to the \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana-sutras X,\n7, and the _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a XIII, 3, 1, 1,\n\np. lxx\n\nwhere the same passage is found. I there spelt the name Sammada, because the\nmajority of the MSS. were in favour of that spelling. In the edition of the \xc3\x82\n_s_ valayana-sutras, which has since been published by Rama Naraya _n_ a\nVidyara _n_ ya, the name is spelt Samada. My own opinion is that Sammada is\nthe right spelling, but that does not prove that Saya _n_ a thought so; and\nunless I deviated from the principles which I had adopted for a critical\nrestoration of Saya _n_ a's text, I could not but write Samada in our passage.\nB 1 and B 4 omit samada, but both give samadakhyasya; Ca. gives likewise\nsamadakhyasya, and A. semadakhyasya. This, I believe, was meant by the writer\nfor sammadakhyasya, for in the passage from the Anukrama _n_ i both A. and Ca.\ngive sammado. I then consulted the commentary of Sha _d_ guru _s_ ishya, and\nthere again the same MS. gave twice sammada, once samada, which is explained\nby samadakhyamahaminara _g_ aputra _h_. A better MS. of Sha _d_ guru _s_\nishya, MS. Wilson 379 gives the readings sammado, sammada, and sammadakhyasya.\nThe other commentary gives distinctly samanda. [I have adopted sammada in the\nnew edition.]\n\nIn IX, 68, Professor Aufrecht adopts what he considers the bold reading\nVatsapri; I prefer to be timid and allow Saya _n_ a his own reading Vatsapri\xcc\x86;\nsee Sarvanukrama _n_ i, ed. Macdonell, pp. 34, 146.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[lxviii:a](sbe3208.htm#fr_39) I find that Mr. Macdonell in his edition of the\nSarvanukrama _n_ i reads ardhar _k_ o\xe0\xa4\xbdhinamno. If this is right, part of my\nargument would fall.\n\n[lxviii:b](sbe3208.htm#fr_40) MS. Wilson 379 has, ardhar _k_ o namano\ndaivatasya, and in the margin \xe0\xa4\xbdhi. Ahirbudhnya seems to have been taken as one\nword.\n\n[lxviii:c](sbe3208.htm#fr_41) The editor of the Bombay edition of the text of\nthe Rig-veda assigns verse 16 to Ahi, verse 17 to Ahirbudhnya.\n\n[lxix:a](sbe3208.htm#fr_42) The interpunction of Dr. Haug's edition (p. 128)\nshould be after te. Sha _d_ guru _s_ ishya says: ata eva brahma _n_ asutrayo\n_h_ prauge vayavyatvaya pra viraya _s_ u _k_ ayo dadrire b vam iti dviva _k_\nanasthane ta ity ekava _k_ anapa _th_ a _h_ k _ri_ ta _h_ , vam ity ukta _m_\n_k_ ed aindratva _m_ _k_ a syad iti. Possibly the same change should be made\nin \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana's _S_ rauta Sutras, VIII, 11, and it has been made by Rama\nNaraya _n_ a Vidyaratna. The remark of the commentator, however, dadrire ta\niti prayogapa _th_ a _h_ , looks as if vam might have been retained in the\ntext. The MSS. I have collated are in favour of te.\n\n[lxix:b](sbe3208.htm#fr_43) Mr. Macdonell (Sarvanukrama _n_ i, p. 133) inserts\nta iti after dadrire.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Part 6](sbe3209.htm)\n\n"
