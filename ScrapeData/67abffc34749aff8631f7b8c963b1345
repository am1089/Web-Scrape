The assumed impossibility of finding an\nequivalent for the idea in English has led to the belief that there is\nsomething mysterious and unprecedented in the institution. People become\nbewildered as to whether it is a religious or a social obligation. Every one\ndemands of the reformer a conflict with it. The whole question grows obscure\nand irritating.\n\nYet all this time we have had an exact synonym for the word, and the parallel\nis the closer since our word connotes the same debatable borderland between\nmorals and good taste. _Caste_ ought to stand translated as _honour_. With\nOriental quaintness, it is true, India has given a certain rigidity to this\nidea, but her analysis of the thing itself is as profound as it is acute.\n\nOur conduct is commonly governed far more by social habit than by\nconsiderations of right and wrong. When the tide of the ethical struggle has\nonce set in over some matter, we may regard ourselves as already half-lost.\nWhy are my friend\'s open letters absolutely safe in my presence, though I am\nlonging for the information they convey? Why\n\np. 117\n\ncan money given for one purpose not be used for another, when all the canons\nof common sense and expediency urge that it should? Who will confess to an\neffort in speaking the truth at any cost whatever? Why, when I am annoyed, do\nI not express myself in the language of Billingsgate? To each of which\nquestions one would reply, somewhat haughtily, that the point was one of\nhonour, or, that such happened to be the custom of one\'s class.\n\nYet if we examine into the sanction which honour can invoke there is nothing\nbeyond a rare exercise of the power of ostracism. The Church excommunicates,\nthe law imprisons, but society merely "cuts" the offender in the street. Yet\nwhich of these three inflicts the deepest wound? It is as true of London as of\nBenares that caste-law is the last and finest that controls a man. For it\ncomes into operation at that precise point where tribunals fail. It takes\ncognisance of offences for which no judge could inflict penalties. It raises\nstandards and demands virtues that every man will interpret according to the\nstringency of his pride, and yet that no one can feel himself to have wholly\nfulfilled. And it does all this without once permitting the sensation of\nmerit. Having done all, one remains an unprofitable servant. For no one would\ncount the punctual discharge of debts (all debts are debts of honour), the\nhauteur that brooks no stain upon the name, the self-respect that builds the\nwhole ethical code upon itself, as religious observances. These things were\ndue, we say, to our birth or blood, or position before men. It is true that\ntheir non-fulfilment would leave a stain upon the conscience, and it is also\ntrue that the attempt to work out the obligations of honour must be the\nimmediate test of the sincerity of one who proposes to lead a life of greater\ndevotion and earnestness than common.\n\np. 118\n\n[paragraph continues] Still, caste is not the same thing as personal piety,\nand perhaps for this reason complete renunciation of its claims and benefits\nis essential in India to the monastic life.\n\nThere is another point about our Western conception of _noblesse oblige_. Few\nas the persons may be who could formulate their sentiment, the fact pervades\nthe whole of the social area. Each class has its own honour. If honourable\nemployers feel compelled to think of the comfort of their workers, honourable\nservants feel equally compelled to keep their lips shut on their masters\'\naffairs, and either responds to an appeal in the name of his ideal. The priest\nmay find the honour of his profession in conflict with that of the detective,\nbut all the world will uphold the faithfulness of both. The efficient\nrealisation of his ideals by the schoolmaster will involve an occasional\npardon, even of a grave offence, if he conceives forgiveness to be the best\nformative influence which at the moment he can command. The very same effort\nin the merchant will require a distribution of punishment that is rigorous and\njust, since order, integrity, and unfailing promptitude--not the development\nof human character--are his ends. Thus every man, in every critical act of his\nlife, calls silently for the judgment of his peers and refuses all other.\n\nThe weaknesses of caste everywhere are manifold. For society, like the\nindividual, is always apt to insist upon the tithing of mint and rue, and to\nneglect the weightier matters of the law. But it is not usually the martyr who\nmarks its worst failure. He is the white dove cast forth by crows, that is, a\nmember of a higher tried by consensus of the lower castes. We have here a case\nof government usurping the functions of society, much as if the headmaster\nshould exercise authority in a dispute among boys. For it is essential to the\nvery idea of honour\n\np. 119\n\nthat every caste should be autonomous. The true failure of caste occurs\nwhenever it establishes such an ascendency of social opinion over the\nindividual\'s conscience that his power of advance is impeded and he becomes\nless of a man, or less really beneficent socially, by remaining more of a\ngentleman--a state of things which is not uncommon among ourselves. For we may\npostulate that all ideals are helpful only in so far as they subserve a man\'s\nmanhood and freedom, and destructive the instant they render him less able to\nexpress his own inmost will. It is he, therefore, who ought to have been a\nmartyr and chose ease who is the true caste victim, not the hero of an _auto-\nda-f e_.\n\nThat this is a real danger we all know. What Protestant has never exalted the\ncreed of his sect over freedom of thought? What Catholic has never put comfort\nabove spirituality? What politician has not preferred party above principle?\nWhat student of science has never been prejudiced against new truth? And if we\nlook without, where do we not see the mere breaker of conventionality treated\nas outside brotherhood? Where do we not find persons conforming to usages that\ndisplease them, merely because they would be inconvenient to dispute?\n\nA certain sweeping justification of such facts may be urged, inasmuch as there\nare circumstances under which the cohesion of the group is well worth the\nsacrifice of the liberty of a few individuals. And the habitual outrage of\ncustom without reason is perhaps rightly held to be as anti-social as any\nfelony. In the last resort, however, social pressure must be held in bounds,\nfor nothing should interfere with a man\'s right to try himself, or sap the\nroots of his independence. And society is a vague and irresponsible\nmagistrate, with so little illumination as to his own purposes and tendencies\nthat he\n\np. 120\n\nfrequently mistakes the pioneers of his march for deserters and orders the\nstoning of prophets, whose sepulchres and monuments will be erected by his\nchildren.\n\nThe question of the inner trend or intention of the social movement must form\nthe law in whose name all doubtful cases are tried. And, while it is never\neasy to determine the point accurately for one\'s own people, in the case of\nthe Hindu race the supreme purpose of their past evolution is quite apparent.\nEven a cursory reading of the Laws of Manu displays Indian society as united\nin a great co-operation for the preservation of the ancient race-treasure of\nSanskrit literature.\n\nThe feeling must have grown up when the Vedas alone required conserving, and\nthe families entrusted with various portions were encouraged to become in all\nways dependent on the community, that every energy might be devoted to the\ntask in hand. This is the real meaning of prostration at the feet of Brahmins,\nof the great merit acquired by feeding them, and of the terror of the crime of\nkilling one. It is not the man, it is race-culture that is destroyed by such\nan act.\n\nAs ages went on and the Upanishads and other things were added to the store,\nthat which was hitherto memorised became entrusted to writing. The _Vedas_\nbecame _Scriptures_ \\--and now the method, of psychology, of astronomy, of\nmathematics, made themselves felt as integral parts of the Aryan treasure, in\ncommon with Sanskrit literature. This widened the conception of culture\nwithout liberalising the social bearings of the question, and the Brahmin\ncaste continued to be recognised as the natural guardians of all learning, the\nold religious compositions being still regarded as the type.\n\nIf we ask how it happened that the Aryan folk became so early conscious of\ntheir responsibility in\n\np. 121\n\nthe matter of Sanskrit letters, there can be only one answer. They found\nthemselves in the presence of other and unlearned races. This point brings us\nto the question of the origin of strongly differentiated castes in general. In\nits nature caste is, as we have seen, honour; that is to say, an ideal\nsentiment by whose means society spontaneously protects itself from some\ndanger against which it is otherwise defenceless. For instance, life in Texas\nhaving been for many years dependent on the possession of horses, and\nsafeguards against the horse-thief being few and difficult, he came to be the\nobject of unprecedented social abhorrence. Horse-stealing was the last crime a\nlost soul would stoop to. In a similar way, as some think, may have grown up\nthe Indian feeling about cow-killing. If the cattle, in time of stress, were\nkilled for food, agriculture would be unable to take a new start, and so a\npeople accustomed to eat beef grasped the situation perhaps, and renounced the\npractice. But since these two sentiments pervade whole nations, they are not\nexactly what we are accustomed to think of as caste, inasmuch as in the latter\nthere is a distinct gradation of rank connected with the sentiment. In the\nterm "blackleg" applied by trade unionists to competing forms of labour, we\nhave an instance of the kind we want. Here we have an occupational group\ngiving birth immediately to the ideal which is necessary to its safety.\nThroughout the worlds of love, of war, and of work, indeed, honour is an\ninstinct of the very greatest potency. How few men, after all, desert to an\nenemy as spies! How strong is the feeling of class-obligation amongst servants\nand working men! This element is very evident in the Indian industrial castes,\nwhich are often simply hereditary trade-unions. No Englishman is so powerful,\nnor is any Hindu so hungry, that one man could be bribed to take up the trade\nof another.\n\np. 122\n\n[paragraph continues] Nothing would induce the dairyman, for instance, to take\ncharge of a horse, or a laundryman to assist the household.\n\nBut the very strongest, and perhaps also ugliest, of all possible roots of\ncaste is the sense of race, the caste of blood. We have an instance of this in\nthe animosity that divides white men from negroes in the United States, and we\nhave other instances, less talked of, all up and down our vast British\npossessions. There is probably no other emotion so inhuman which receives such\nuniversal sympathy as this. For it is fundamentally the physical instinct of a\nvigorous type to protect itself from fusion. And both sides participate in the\nrevulsion. Here we have the secret of rigid caste, for the only rigid caste is\nhereditary, and of hereditary caste the essential characteristic is the\nrefusal of intermarriage.\n\nGranting, then, what could not well be denied, that the Aryan forefathers\nfound themselves in India face to face with inferior and aboriginal races,\nwhat may we gather, from the nature of the caste system to-day, to have been\nthe elements of the problem, as they more or less clearly perceived it?\n\nThose elements we may infer to have been four in number.\n\n1\\. They desired above all things to preserve the honour of their daughters\nfrom marriage with lower and savage peoples. Exclusion from marriage with any\nbut one\'s own caste became the rigorous rule, the penalty fell on the father\nand the family that permitted a woman to go unguarded on this head. To this\nday, if a son marry beneath caste he degrades himself; but if a daughter be\nwrongly given, the whole family becomes out-casted.\n\n2\\. They seem to have desired to preserve the aboriginal races, on the one\nhand from extermination, and on the other from slavery of the person.--\n\np. 123\n\ntwo solutions which seemed later the only alternatives to Aryan persons in a\nsimilar position! Those aborigines, therefore, who became dependent on the\nAryan population, had their definite place assigned them in the scale of\nlabour, and their occupations were secured to them by the contempt of the\nsuperior race.\n\nWe must not forget, in the apparent harshness of this convention, its large\nfactor of hygienic caution. The aborigines were often carrion-eaters, and\nalways uncleanly in comparison with their neighbours. It was natural enough,\ntherefore, that there should be a refusal to drink the same water, and so on.\n\nOn the other hand, it is one of the mistakes of caste everywhere, that it\ninstitutionalises and perpetuates an inequality which might have been\nminimised. But we must not forget, in the case of the Indian system, the two\ngreater evils which were avoided altogether.\n\n3\\. The Aryans realised very clearly that it was not only their race but also\ntheir civilisation that must be maintained in its purity. The word _Aryan_\nimplies one acquainted with the processes of agriculture, an _earer_ of the\nground, to use an Elizabethan word--accustomed therefore to a fixed and\nindustrialised mode of living, evidently in contrast to others who were not.\n\nFire and the processes of cooking and eating food are easily distinguished as\nthe core of the Personal life and establishment in a climate where habits can\nat any time be made so simple as in India. It is these that can never be\ndispensed with, though they may be arranged for to-night in a palace, and to-\nmorrow in the jungle under a tree.\n\nIn view, then, of the necessity of safeguarding the system of manners, grew up\nthe restrictions against\n\np. 124\n\neating with those of lower caste, or allowing them to touch the food and wants\nof their betters. The fact that the Aryan could eat food cooked by Aryan hands\nalone, implied that the strictest preliminaries of bathing had been complied\nwith.\n\nBy a continuous crystallisation, all caste laws--from being the enunciation of\nbroad canons of refinement as between Aryan and non-Aryan--came to be the\nregular caste-barriers between one class and another of the same race. In this\nway they lost their invidious character.\n\nIt is undeniable that this caste of the kitchen, so wittily named "don\'t\ntouchism" by a modern Hindu leader, lends itself to abuse and becomes an\ninstrument of petty persecution more readily than the intermarriage laws. Some\nof the saddest instances of caste-failure have occurred here. Nevertheless,\nthe original intention remains clear and true, and is by no means completely\nobscured, even with the lapse of ages.\n\n4\\. It was, however, in their perception of the fourth element of the problem\nthat the early Aryans triumphantly solved the riddle of Humanity. They seem to\nhave seen clearly that amongst the aborigines of India themselves were many\ndegrees of social development already existent, and that these must be\npreserved and encouraged to progress.\n\nFrom such a comprehension of the situation sprang the long and still growing\ngraduation of non-Aryan castes, some of which have established themselves in\nthe course of ages within the Aryan pale. Marriage, for instance, is an\nelaborate and expensive social function in the highest classes. But as we\ndescend it becomes easier, till amongst the Baghdis, Bauris, and other\naboriginal castes, almost any connection is ratified by the recognition of\nwomen and children. This is a point in which Eastern scores over Western\ndevelopment; for in\n\np. 125\n\n[paragraph continues] Europe the Church has caused to be reckoned as immoral\nwhat might, with more philosophy, have been treated as the lingering customs\nof sub-organised race-strata.\n\nAs is the nature of caste, mere social prestige constitutes a perpetual\nstimulus and invitation to rise, which means in this case to increase the\nnumber of daily baths and the cleanliness of cooking, and to restrict to purer\nand finer kinds the materials used for food, approximating continually toward\nthe Brahmin standard. For is it not true that _noblesse oblige?_ This fact it\nis that makes Hinduism always the vigorous living banyan, driving civilisation\ndeeper and wider as it grows, and not the fossilised antiquity superficial\nobservers have supposed.\n\nSuch, then, is the historic picture of the rise of caste. The society thus\noriginated fell into four main groups:\n\n(1) Priests and learned men--the Brahmins;\n\n(2) The royal and military caste;\n\n(3) Professional men and merchants--the middle-class or _bourgeoisie_ , as we\nsay in Europe; and\n\n(4) The working people, or sudras, in all their divisions.\n\n(Of the second group only the Rajput branch remains now stable. For the\nmilitary caste, finding itself leaderless under the Maurya dynasty, is said to\nhave become literary, and is certainly now absorbed in the _bourgeoisie_.)\n\nThis functional grouping, however, is traversed in all directions nowadays by\nthe lines of caste. In the mountains it is no uncommon thing to find the\nBrahmin acting as a labourer, impressed as a coolie, or working as a farmer,\nand in the cities he belongs largely to the professional ranks. Many of\nIndia\'s most learned and active sons, on the other hand, belong to the third\nand even fourth\n\np. 126\n\ndivisions. And the new castes, which are of constant growth, are less easy\nthan the old to classify.\n\nEvery new community means a new caste in India. Thus we have the Mohammedan,\nthe Christian, and the modern reform castes--of all of which one peculiarity\nis non-belief in the caste principle!--as well as others. And who shall\ndetermine, for instance, to which of the four main grades Mohammedanism, with\nits inclusion of peasant, citizen, and prince, belongs?\n\nThe fact is, if a man\'s mode of life be acceptable to his own caste-fellows,\nthe rest of Indian society has no quarrel with it. And this autonomy of castes\nit is which is the real essential for social flexibility and fundamental\nequality. As bearing on this point, few utterances have ever been so misquoted\nas the great dictum of Buddha, that "he who attains to God is the true\nBrahmin." For this is misquoted whenever it is made to imply that the Brahmin\nholds in any sense a monopoly in religion. No possible statement could be more\nforeign to the genius of Hinduism. When we read that shortest and greatest of\nIndia\'s gospels, the "Bhagavad Gita" (a poem composed by Brahmins, preserved\nby Brahmins, and distributed through the length and breadth of the country,\nalways by Brahmins), we find ourselves in the presence of the most\ncomprehensive mind that ever contemplated Hindu life. The compassion of\nBuddha, perhaps, looms greater across the centuries, but in dealing with\nsocial problems his very tenderness and spiritual fire make him second to\nKrishna, who was always calm, broad, and consistently national in his outlook.\nWe must accept the Gita as an authoritative pronouncement on Hindu society.\nAnd the Gita rings with the constantly reiterated implication that "he who\nattains to God is the true man," while it interprets all life and\nresponsibility as\n\np. 127\n\na means to this end. Thus, "Better one\'s own duty, though imperfect, than the\nduty of another well discharged. Better death in one\'s own duty; the duty of\nanother brings on danger." We have to remember, too, that the Gita is made up\nof the very best of the Vedas and Upanishads, and was specially written for\nthe benefit of women and the working classes, who, as destitute of classical\nlearning, had little chance of studying these great scriptures. But its\ncontents were to depend upon Brahmin effort for promulgation. Another witness\nto the fact that spirituality has always been regarded in India as the common\nhuman possession lies in the Hindu word for religion itself-- _dharmma_ , or\n_the man-ness_ of man. This is very striking. The whole weight, of the\nconception is shifted away from creed, much more from caste or race, to that\nwhich is universal and permanent in each and every human being. And, last of\nall, we may remember that the greatest historical teachers of Hinduism--Rama,\nKrishna, and Buddha, besides many of the Upanishadic period--were men of the\nsecond, or military, caste.\n\nNo, the Brahmin was never in any sense the privileged monopolist of religion:\nhe was a common _channel_ of religious lore, because his actual function was\nSanskrit culture, and Sanskrit happens to be the vehicle of the most perfect\nreligious thought that the world ever produced, but "realisation" itself has\nalways been recognised as a very different matter from this, and, Brahmin or\nnon-Brahmin, has been accepted wherever it appeared. The advantage that the\npriestly caste did undoubtedly enjoy, however, lay in the fact that in their\ncase the etiquette of rank led directly to the highest inspiration, as the\nscholar\'s life, even in its routine, will be nearest to that of the saint.\n\nOne peculiarity of the place of the religious life in the Indian system is\nthat it is an inclusive term for\n\np. 128\n\nall forms of higher individuation. Theoretically, to the Hindu mind, all\ngenius is inspiration, the perception of unity; and the mathematics of Euclid\nor the sculpture of Michael Angelo would be as authentic an expression of the\nreligious consciousness as the sainthood of Francis. Only the result of this\nmethod of interpretation is that sainthood takes precedence of all others as\nthe commonest form of greatness. Scientific research, as in the astronomy of\nBhashkar Acharya and the psychology of Patanjali, has not had sufficient\nopportunity of securing defined and independent scope. And literature has been\nyoked to the car of mythology as much as the art of mediaeval Italy.\n\nNevertheless, India is too well acquainted with genius to forget that the\ncaste of the spirit is beyond human limitation, often beyond recognition. It\nis held that the best lower men can do for that brotherhood which asserts\nitself in the consciousness of greatness is to give it freedom. Hence a man\ncan always be released from social obligations if he desire to live the life\nof ideas, of the soul. Only, it is held that if he will not fulfil the law,\nneither shall he add to the burdens of the community. So he who claims to be\none of the great spiritual beyond-castes must renounce family and property,\nrelying upon the charity of men for his daily bread, and knowing well that for\nany work of scholarship--such as the observatories at Benares and Jeypore--a\nHindu [government](errata.htm#0) at least would provide him ample means. It is\nonly as long as one avails oneself of the benefits of the social structure\nthat it is held not unreasonable to require conformity to its usages.\n\nThis renunciation is _Sannyas_ , the Indian form of monasticism, and Sannyas,\ntheories to the contrary notwithstanding, has always been open to all castes.\nIndeed, it is held that when the responsibilities of\n\np. 129\n\nlife are over, a man\'s duty is to leave the world and spend the remainder of\nhis days in that state; and in some parts of Northern India one meets with\n"Tyagi Mehtars," or monastics who were by birth the lowest of the low.\n\nTheoretically, the monk is caste-fellow of the whole world, prepared to eat\nwith any one; and where, by sheer dint of spirituality and self-discipline,\nsuch a feeling is realised, every Hindu in India considers the broken bread of\nthis lover of mankind as sacramental food. It is usual, too, to eat from the\nhands of holy men without inquiry as to their standing when in the world.\n\nOne of the most interesting points in all this to a Western mind is the\ndifference implied and established between the caste of priests or chaplains\non the one hand, and the fact of spiritual realisation, outside all caste, on\nthe other. Nothing in the Indian thought about life can be more striking than\nthis. The family chaplain in Bengal may be the official teacher, but every man\nand woman discards his authority silently the instant they find some soul (in\nthe world or out of it; it may be husband or child, or the holy man living in\nhis garden; usually it is an ascetic), with a quickening spiritual touch upon\ntheir own. He or she then becomes the _guru_ , or teacher, and this\nrelationship is made the central fact of life.\n\nThe appearance of this new teacher, when he is powerful enough to be an\nimportant social phenomenon, is the historic origin of almost all new castes.\nThe Sikh nation was formed in this way by a succession of gurus. Chaitanya\nwelcomed all castes to Vaishnavism and made it possible for them to rise\nthereby. The scavengers, too low to venture to claim either Hinduism or\nMohammedanism as their own, were raised in consideration and self-respect by\nGuru Nanuk\n\np. 130\n\nand Lal Begi Mehtar--the last a saint of their own degree.\n\nThe preacher arises and proclaims the new idea. He gathers about him men of\nall classes: the educated won to the service of his thought, the ignorant\nswept in by the radiance of his personality. Amongst his disciples\ndistinctions of caste break down. The whole group is stamped with his\ncharacter and prestige. Eventually, if it contain a preponderance of Brahmin\nelements, it may take rank with the best, carrying certain individuals up with\nit. But if it be composed chiefly of the scum of society, it will remain\nlittle considered; and yet, in the strength of its religious and intellectual\nsignificance may certainly claim to have progressed beyond its original point.\nSuch is likely to be the fate of the present Christian converts. Those who are\nrecruited from the lowest pariahs may acquire a certain prestige from their\nnew faith and take a better place in the social scale, consequently, in\ncenturies to come. At the same time we must not forget that forty or fifty\nyears ago, conversions were made that undoubtedly involved great sacrifices,\nand the descendants of these Christians may lose rather than gain in the long\nrun.\n\nTaking the history of Hinduism as a whole, we observe a great systole and\ndiastole of caste, the Buddhist and the present Christian periods ranking as\nwell-marked eras of fusion, while the intervening centuries are characterised\nby progressive definition, broken every now and then by a wave of reform which\nthought itself a movement towards caste abolition, but ended simply in the\nformation of a new group. For this is the fact in which all would-be\nreformations in India find at once their opportunity and their limit. It may\nnow be taken as proved that in order to affect caste widely the agitator would\nneed to aim deeper than\n\np. 131\n\nthe external phenomena, at underlying spiritual impulses.\n\n\n\nIf this theory of caste be valid, then, we find that the word signifies not so\nmuch mere rank in society as the standard of honour which is associated with\nrank. And as the private\'s conduct may be governed as much as his officer\'s by\nenlightened self-respect, we have seen that honour is something which applies\nto the whole of society equally. Even Tennyson, it will be remembered,\npictures the country youth as outvaunting Lady Clara Vere de Vere in her pride\nof birth. The word caste, therefore, is by no means that antithesis of\n_democracy_ which has been so commonly assumed.\n\nNeither, amongst a people familiar with the process of self-organisation,\nwould it prove any barrier to efficient co-operation. For the one essential to\nthis power is an established habit of ignoring all points of mutual difference\nnot germane to the matter in hand. What we call good-breeding, or what India\ncalls _caste_ , ought to make this easier. For any group of men met together\nfor a common purpose find their individual rights secured to them in this way,\nand are free, by age-long acceptance, from any suspicion of another\'s desire\nto interfere with them. This is a basis of strength and not of weakness; so\nthat it seems, if Indian men and women are not at present capable of combined\naction to any great degree, it is a matter of their own neglect of the habit,\nand not a necessary consequence of their institutions. We need not too readily\naccept the statement of such weakness, either, as infallible. My own\nobservation has been that the Hindu people are capable enough of vigorous co-\noperation along the lines natural to them, those of the undivided family, the\nvillage community, and others. That inability which Europeans would show to\nface\n\np. 132\n\nthese tests, they may be expected to display before ours\n\nTo be absolutely just, however, we must admit that the observance of caste law\nhas entailed many foolish and irritating losses upon society during the last\nfifty years. We have seen that there are definite reasons, not wanting in\ncogency, why a man of good birth should not eat in all companies, or of food\ncooked by hands supposed less cleanly. Such rules, however, cannot be kept by\nthose who, for any reason, cross the seas to Europe. This fact, more than any\nother detail, makes it a matter of out-casting to take the journey, and\npersecutions have sometimes ensued which are shocking to contemplate. A man\nmay care little about the loss of station for his own sake, but the shoe\npinches when he finds himself unable to make worthy marriages for his\ndaughters; hence he will often submit to a heavy fine in order to buy back his\nposition. This rouses the cupidity of ignorant and conventional persons who\nhappen to have authority with the stay-at-home community, and such are apt to\nbe unscrupulous in bringing about the ruin or recantation of any who resist\ntheir power. This is a series of events which does occur occasionally; but it\nneed not be supposed that every Europe-returning Hindu who is kept at arm\'s\nlength is a martyr. There is an element of distrust for the moral results of a\nvisit to the West in the situation; and this is not altogether unreasonable.\nIt is chiefly with regard to possibilities of political, practical, or\ntechnical education that caste deterrence is to be regretted, and it is\nobvious that as communities progress in the power of estimating modern\nconditions, they must recognise the suicidal nature of such an attitude. Yet\nit is curious to note here how caste may become thus a very real instrument of\nequality, for the power of the individual to advance is by this means\n\nkept strictly in ratio to the thinking of the society in which he lives. This\nfact is characteristic. The good of caste, of race, of family stands first,\nand only second that of the individual man or woman in India. To take another\nplane. Let a man of the lower castes become wealthy, and he is compelled to\neducate men of his own rank to marry his daughters. Thus the group to which he\nowes birth, vigour, and development receives from him again the benefits of\nhis life\'s work. This is the exact opposite of the European device, where the\nupper class absorbs money, talent, and beauty from the lower, while that is\ncontinually recruited by the failures from above.\n\nThe fact that every human force is polar in its moral activity needs little\ndemonstration in the case of social pride. Every day we see this working on\nthe one hand for the highest idealism, on the other for revolting egotism.\nSocial exclusiveness may be condoned, it may even robbed of its sting but,\nespecially when coupled with personal exultation, it can never be made\nanything but vulgar-looking to the disinterested outsider. It is not to be\nsupposed that Indian caste forms any exception to this rule of double effect.\nNevertheless, it is well to understand the conditions of the sentiment,\nperceiving how inevitably this very thing repeats itself wherever two\nphysically-distinguishable races are found side by side.\n\nAnd it cannot be denied that great benefits as well as great evils have\naccrued from caste. It is an institution that makes Hindu society the most\neclectic with regard to ideas in the world. In India all religions have taken\nrefuge *\\--the Parsi before\n\np. 134\n\nthe tide of Mussulman conquest; the Christians of Syria; the Jews. And they\nhave received more than shelter--they have had the hospitality of a world that\nhad nothing to fear from the foreigner who came in the name of freedom of\nconscience. Caste made this possible, for in one sense it is the social\nformulation of defence minus all elements of aggression. Again, surely it is\nsomething that in a country conquered for a thousand years the doorkeeper of a\nviceroy\'s palace would feel his race too good to share a cup of water with the\nruler of all India. We do not easily measure the moral strength that is here\ninvolved, for the habit of guarding the treasure of his birth for an unborn\nposterity feeds a deep, undying faith in destiny in the Hindu heart. "To-day\nhere, to-morrow gone," says the most ignorant _sotto voce_ as he looks at the\nforeigner, and the unspoken refrain of his thought is, "I and mine abide for\never." Caste is race-continuity; it is the historic sense; it is the dignity\nof tradition and of purpose for the future. It is even more: it is the\nfamiliarity of a whole people in all its grades with the one supreme human\nmotive--the notion of _noblesse oblige_. For though it is true that all men\nare influenced by this principle, it is also probably true that only the\nprivileged are very conscious of the fact. Is caste, then, simply a burden, to\nbe thrown off lightly, as a thing irksome and of little moment?\n\nAnd yet, if India is ever to regain national efficiency, this old device of\nthe forefathers must be modified in the process,--exactly how, the Indian\npeople themselves can alone determine. For India to-day has lost national\nefficiency. This fact there is no gainsaying. Her needs now are not what they\nwere yesterday. The Brahmins lose distinctiveness in these days of cheap\nprinting and widespread literacy. But this only means that the country\n\np. 135\n\nrequires multiplied methods of self-expression as the goal and summit of her\nnational endeavour. She wants a greater flexibility, perhaps, a readier power\nof self-adjustment than she has ever had. But it ought to come in an influx of\nconsciousness of those great spiritual tides on whose surface all questions of\ncaste and non-caste can be lifted into new and higher inter-relations. Chief\namong all her needs is that of a passionate drawing together amongst her\npeople themselves. The cry of home, of country, of place is yet to be heard by\nthe soul of every Indian man and woman in Hindustan, and following hard upon\nit must sound the overtones of labour and of race.\n\nThen the question of whether to walk or not in the ways of the forefathers\nwill be lost in the knowledge of the abundant power to hew out new roads, as\nthose fathers did before them. Has India the possibilities still left in her\nown nature which can bring to her such an epoch?\n\nThere are some who believe that there is no task beyond the ultimate power of\nthe Hindu peoples to perform. The nation that has stood so persistently for\nrighteousness through untold ages, has conserved such vast springs of vigour\nin itself, as must ultimately enable her to command Destiny. The farseeing\nwisdom and gentleness of her old constitution may unfit her for the modern\nworld, but they are a sure proof, nevertheless, of her possession of\nsufficient sense of affairs to guide her to a full development once more.\n\nFor, after all, who were these old forefathers, with their marvellous cunning?\nWhat inspired them so to construct the social framework that every act of\nrebellion and invasion should end henceforth only in contributing a new morsel\nof colour to fit into the old mosaic? Ah, who were they indeed? We may well\nask, for have we not all this time been calling\n\np. 136\n\nby their name one far greater than they, one infinitely more deserving of our\nreverence--the Communal Consciousness, namely, of a mighty patient people,\ntoiling on and on through the ages up the paths of knowledge, destroying\nnever, assimilating always, what they gain of truth and science, and\nhesitating only a little before fresh developments, because they are so\npreoccupied with the problems of the past that they do not realise that that\nstage is done, and that the sun is risen to-day on a new landscape,\nconfronting them with fresh perils and unthought-of difficulties?\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[116:*](wil10.htm#fr_10) The word _Caste_ is of Portuguese origin.\n\n[132:*](wil10.htm#fr_11) Parsi, Jew, Christian.--The Parsis took refuge in\nIndia a thousand years ago, fleeing before the Mohammedan conquest of Persia.\nThere are ancient communities of Jews and Christians also from Asia Minor and\nSyria.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter IX.
