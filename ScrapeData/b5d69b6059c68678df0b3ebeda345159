O H _ri_ shike _s_ a! O destroyer of Ke _s_ in! I wish\nto know the truth about renunciation and abandonment distinctly.\n\nThe Deity said:\n\nBy renunciation the sages understand the rejection of actions done with\ndesires. The wise call the abandonment of the fruit of all actions (by the\nname) abandonment. Some wise men say, that action should be abandoned as being\nfull of evil; and others, that the actions of sacrifice, gift, and penance\n\np. 122\n\nshould not be abandoned. As to that abandonment, O best of the descendants of\nBharata! listen to my decision; for abandonment, O bravest of men! is\ndescribed (to be) threefold. The actions of sacrifice, gift, and penance\nshould not be abandoned; they must needs be performed; for sacrifices, gifts,\nand penances are means of sanctification to the wise. But even these actions,\nO son of P _ri_ tha! should be performed, abandoning attachment and fruit;\nsuch is my excellent and decided opinion. The renunciation of prescribed\naction is not proper. Its abandonment through delusion 1 is described as of\nthe quality of darkness. When a man abandons action, merely as being\ntroublesome, through fear of bodily affliction, he does not obtain the fruit 2\nof abandonment by making (such) passionate abandonment. When prescribed action\nis performed, O Ar _g_ una! abandoning attachment and fruit also, merely\nbecause it ought to be performed, that is deemed (to be) a good abandonment.\nHe who is possessed of abandonment 3, being full of goodness, and talented,\nand having, his doubts destroyed, is not averse from unpleasant actions, is\nnot attached to pleasant 4 (ones). Since no embodied (being) can abandon\nactions without exception 5, he is said to be possessed of abandonment, who\nabandons the fruit of action. The threefold fruit of action, agreeable,\ndisagreeable, and mixed, accrues after death to those who are not possessed of\nabandonment, but never to\n\np. 123\n\nrenouncers 1. Learn from me, O you of mighty arms! these five causes of the\ncompletion of all actions, declared in the Sa _n_ khya system 2. The\nsubstratum, the agent likewise, the various sorts of organs, and the various\nand distinct movements, and with these the deities, too, as the fifth.\nWhatever action, just or otherwise, a man performs with his body, speech, and\nmind, these five are its causes. That being so, the undiscerning man, who\nbeing of an unrefined understanding, sees the agent in the immaculate self,\nsees not (rightly) 3. He who has no feeling of egoism 4, and whose mind is not\ntainted, even though he kills (all) these people, kills not, is not fettered,\n5 (by the action). Knowledge 6, the object of knowledge, the knower--threefold\nis the prompting to action. The instrument, the action, the agent, thus in\nbrief is action threefold. Knowledge and action and agent\n\np. 124\n\nare declared in the enumeration of qualities 1 (to be) of three classes only,\naccording to the difference of qualities. Hear about these also as they really\nare. Know that knowledge to be good, by which (a man) sees one entity,\ninexhaustible, and not different in all things (apparently) different 2 (from\none another). Know that knowledge to be passionate, which is (based) on\ndistinctions 3 (between different entities), which sees in all things various\nentities of different kinds. And that is described as dark, which clings to\none created (thing) only as everything, which is devoid of reason, devoid of\nreal principle, and insignificant 4. That action is called good, which is\nprescribed, which is devoid of attachment, which is not done from (motives of)\naffection or aversion, (and which is done) by one not wishing for the fruit.\nThat is described as passionate, which (occasions) much trouble, is performed\nby one who wishes for objects of desire, or one who is full of egotism 5. The\naction is called dark, which is commenced through delusion, without regard to\nconsequences, loss, injury, or strength 6. That agent is called good, who has\ncast off attachment, who is free from egotistic talk, who is possessed of\ncourage and energy, and unaffected by success or ill-success. That agent is\ncalled passionate, who is full of affections 7,\n\np. 125\n\nwho wishes for the fruit of actions, who is covetous, cruel, and impure, and\nfeels joy and sorrow. That agent is called dark, who is without application 1,\nvoid of discernment, headstrong, crafty, malicious, lazy, melancholy, and\nslow. Now hear, O Dhana\xc3\xb1 _g_ aya! the threefold division of intelligence 2 and\ncourage, according to qualities, which I am about to declare exhaustively and\ndistinctly. That intelligence, O son of P _ri_ tha! is good which understands\naction and inaction 3, what ought to be done and what ought not to be done,\ndanger and the absence of danger, emancipation and bondage. That intelligence,\nO son of P _ri_ tha! is passionate, by which one imperfectly understands piety\nand impiety, what ought to be done and also what ought not to be done. That\nintelligence, O son of P _ri_ tha! is dark, which shrouded by darkness,\nunderstands impiety (to be) piety, and all things incorrectly. That courage, O\nson of P _ri_ tha! is good courage, which is unswerving 4, and by which one\ncontrols the operations of the mind, breath, and senses, through abstraction.\nBut, O Ar _g_ una! that courage is passionate, by which one adheres to piety,\nlust, and wealth 5, and through attachment 6 wishes,\n\np. 126\n\n[paragraph continues] O son of P _ri_ tha! for the fruit, That courage is\ndark, O son of P _ri_ tha! by which an undiscerning man does not give up\nsleep, fear, sorrow, despondency, and folly. Now, O chief of the descendants\nof Bharata! bear from me about the three sorts of happiness. That happiness is\ncalled good, in which one is pleased after repetition 1 (of enjoyment), and\nreaches the close of all misery, which is like poison first and comparable to\nnectar in the long run, and which is produced from a clear knowledge of the\nself 2. That happiness is called passionate, which (flows) from contact\nbetween the senses and their objects, and which is at first comparable to\nnectar and in the long run like poison. That happiness is described as dark,\nwhich arises from sleep, laziness, heedlessness, which deludes the self, both\nat first and in its consequences. There is no entity either on earth or in\nheaven among the gods, which is free from these three qualities born of\nnature. The duties of Brahma _n_ as, Kshatriyas, and Vai _s_ yas, and of _S_\nudras, too, O terror of your foes! are distinguished according to the\nqualities born of nature 3. Tranquillity 4, restraint of the senses, penance,\npurity, forgiveness, straightforwardness, also knowledge, experience, and\nbelief (in a future world), this is the natural duty of Brahma _n_ as. Valour,\nglory, Courage,\n\np. 127\n\ndexterity 1, not slinking away from battle, gifts, exercise of lordly power 2,\nthis is the natural duty of Kshatriyas. Agriculture, tending cattle, trade,\n(this) is the natural duty of Vai _s_ yas, And the natural duty of _S_ udras,\ntoo, consists in service. (Every) man intent on his own respective duties\nobtains perfection 3. Listen, now, how one intent on one's own duty obtains\nperfection. Worshipping, by (the performance of) his own duty, him from whom\nall things proceed, and by whom all this is permeated, a man obtains\nperfection. One's duty, though defective, is better than another's duty well\nperformed 4. Performing the duty prescribed by nature, one does not incur sin.\nO son of Kunti! one should not abandon a natural duty though tainted with\nevil; for all actions are enveloped by evil, as fire by smoke 5. One who is\nself-restrained, whose understanding is unattached everywhere, from whom\naffections have departed, obtains the supreme perfection of freedom from\naction 6 by renunciation. Learn from me, only in brief, O son of Kunti! how\none who has obtained perfection attains the Brahman, which is the highest\nculmination of knowledge. A man possessed of a pure understanding, controlling\nhis self by courage, discarding sound and other objects of sense, casting off\naffection\n\np. 128\n\nand aversion; who frequents clean places, who eats little, whose speech, body,\nand mind are restrained, who is always intent on meditation and mental\nabstraction 1, and has recourse to unconcern, who abandoning egoism 2,\nstubbornness, arrogance, desire, anger, and (all) belongings, has no (thought\nthat this or that is) mine, and who is tranquil, becomes fit for assimilation\nwith the Brahman. Thus reaching the Brahman 3, and with a tranquil self, he\ngrieves not, wishes not; but being alike to all beings, obtains the highest\ndevotion to me. By (that) devotion he truly understands who I am and how\ngreat. And then understanding me truly, he forthwith enters into my (essence).\nEven performing all actions, always depending on me, he, through my favour,\nobtains the imperishable and eternal seat. Dedicating in thought 4 all actions\nto me, be constantly given up to me, (placing) your thoughts on me, through\nrecourse to mental abstraction. (Placing) your thoughts on me, you will cross\nover all difficulties by my favour. But if you will not listen through egotism\n5, you will be ruined. If entertaining egotism, you think that you may not\nfight, vain, indeed, is that resolution of yours. Nature 6 will constrain you.\nThat, O son of Kunti! which through delusion you do not wish to do, you will\ndo involuntarily,\n\np. 129\n\ntied down by your own duty, flowing from your nature. The lord, O Ar _g_ una!\nis seated in the region of the heart 1 of all beings, turning round all beings\n(as though) mounted on a machine, by his delusion. With him, O descendant of\nBharata! seek shelter in every way 2; by his favour you will obtain the\nhighest tranquillity, the eternal seat. Thus have I declared to you the\nknowledge more mysterious than any mystery. Ponder over it thoroughly, and\nthen act as you like. Once more, listen to my excellent words-most mysterious\nof all. Strongly I like you, therefore I will declare what is for your\nwelfare. On me (place) your mind, become my devotee, sacrifice to me,\nreverence me, you will certainly come to me. I declare to you truly, you are\ndear to me. Forsaking all duties 3, come to me as (your) sole refuge. I will\nrelease you from all sins. Be not grieved. This 4 you should never declare to\none who performs no penance 5, who is not a devotee 6, nor to one who does not\nwait on (some preceptor) 7, nor yet to one who calumniates me. He who, with\nthe highest devotion 8 to me, will proclaim this supreme mystery among my\ndevotees, will come to me, freed from (all) doubt. No one\n\np. 130\n\namongst men is superior to him in doing what is dear to me. And there will\nnever be another on earth dearer to me than he. And he who will study this\nholy dialogue of ours, will, such is my opinion, have offered to me the\nsacrifice of knowledge 1. And the man, also, who with faith and without\ncarping will listen (to this), will be freed (from sin), and attain to the\nholy regions of those who perform pious acts 2. Have you listened to this, O\nson of P _ri_ tha! with a mind (fixed) on (this) one point only? Has your\ndelusion (caused) by ignorance been destroyed, O Dhana\xc3\xb1 _g_ aya?\n\nAr _g_ una said:\n\nDestroyed is my delusion; by your favour, O undegraded one! I (now) recollect\n3 myself. I stand freed from doubts 4. I will do your bidding.\n\nSa\xc3\xb1 _g_ aya said:\n\nThus did I hear this dialogue between Vasudeva and the high-minded son of P\n_ri_ tha, (a dialogue) wonderful and causing the hair to stand on end. By the\nfavour of Vyasa, I heard this highest mystery, (this) devotion 5, from K _ri_\nsh _n_ a himself, the lord of the possessors of mystic power, who proclaimed\nit in person. O king! remembering and (again) remembering this wonderful and\nholy dialogue of Ke _s_ ava and Ar _g_ una, I rejoice over and over again. And\nremembering and (again) remembering that\n\np. 131\n\nexcessively wonderful form of Hari also, great is my amazement, O king! and I\nrejoice over and over again. Wherever (is) K _ri_ sh _n_ a, the lord of the\npossessors of mystic power, wherever (is the (great) archer, the son of\nPritha, there in my opinion (are) fortune, victory, prosperity 1, and eternal\njustice.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[121:1](sbe0819.htm#fr_523) I. e. either the Brahman itself, or sacrifice,\npenance, and gift.\n\n[121:2](sbe0819.htm#fr_524) Cf. Sutta Nipata, p. 69.\n\n[121:3](sbe0819.htm#fr_525) The meaning of this whole passage seems to be that\nthese three words, which designate the Brahman, have distinct uses, as\nspecified. 'Om,' says Nilaka _nth_ a, is employed whether the action is done\nwith any special desire or not. Those who study the Brahman there means 'study\nthe Vedas.' 'Tad' is employed in case of actions without desires only. 'Sat'\nis employed, according to _S_ a _n_ kara, in case of existence, such as the\nbirth of a first son; I goodness,' the reclamation of a bad man; 'auspicious\nacts,' marriage, &c. The intelligent use of these terms as here specified is\nsaid to cure any defects in the actions, the various classes of which are\nmentioned before.\n\n[122:1](sbe0820.htm#fr_526) Without delusion no such abandonment will occur.\n\n[122:2](sbe0820.htm#fr_527) Namely, final emancipation, by means of purity of\nheart.\n\n[122:3](sbe0820.htm#fr_528) I. e. who has the frame of mind necessary for a\ngood abandonment.\n\n[122:4](sbe0820.htm#fr_529) Such as bathing at midday in summer.\n\n[122:5](sbe0820.htm#fr_530) Cf. [p. 53](sbe0805.htm#page_53) supra.\n\n[123:1](sbe0820.htm#fr_531) The original is sannyasi, but _S_ ridhara is\nprobably right in taking it to mean one who has command of 'abandonment.' _S_\na _n_ kara and Madhusudana, however, take the word in its ordinary sense of\n'ascetic.' What follows explains, says _S_ ridhara, why 'the fruit does not\naccrue to renouncers.'\n\n[123:2](sbe0820.htm#fr_532) _S_ a _n_ kara and Madhusudana say this means\nVedanta- _s_ astra. _S_ ridhara suggests also the alternative Sa _n_ khya-\nsastra. Substratum =the body, in which desire, aversion, &c. are manifested;\nagent = one who egoistically thinks himself the doer of actions; organs =\nsenses of perception, action, &c.; movements = of the vital breaths in the\nbody; deities = the deities which preside over the eye and other senses (as to\nthis cf. Aitareya-upanishad, p. 45; Pra _s_ na, pp. 216, 217; Mu _nd_ aka, p.\n314; Aitareya-ara _n_ yaka. pp. 88-270: and Max Muller's Hibbert Lectures, p.\n204, note).\n\n[123:3](sbe0820.htm#fr_533) Cf. [p. 106](sbe0815.htm#page_106).\n\n[123:4](sbe0820.htm#fr_534) Egoism = the feeling that he is the doer of the\naction; taint = the feeling that the fruit of the action must accrue to him.\n\n[123:5](sbe0820.htm#fr_535) Cf. [p. 45](sbe0804.htm#page_45), and Dhammapada,\nstanza 294.\n\n[123:6](sbe0820.htm#fr_536) Knowledge, i.e. that something is a means to what\nis desired; object is the means; the knower is he who has this knowledge. When\nthese-co-exist we have action. The instrument = senses, &c.\n\n[124:1](sbe0820.htm#fr_537) The system of Kapila.\n\n[124:2](sbe0820.htm#fr_538) Cf. [p. 104](sbe0815.htm#page_104).\n\n[124:3](sbe0820.htm#fr_539) Cf. Ka _th_ opanishad, p. 129.\n\n[124:4](sbe0820.htm#fr_540) Reason = argument in support; real principle =\ntruth, view of things as they are; insignificant, i. e. in comprehensiveness.\n\n[124:5](sbe0820.htm#fr_541) I. e. 'pride of learning,' &c., _S_ a _n_ kara;\n'egoism,' Ramanuga.\n\n[124:6](sbe0820.htm#fr_542) Consequences = good or evil resulting; loss = of\nwealth or strength; injury = to others; strength = one's own capacity.\n\n[124:7](sbe0820.htm#fr_543) I. e. 'for children,' &c., according to _S_\nridhara; 'for the action,' according to others.\n\n[125:1](sbe0820.htm#fr_544) I. e. attention to work; melancholy = always\ndesponding and wanting in energy.\n\n[125:2](sbe0820.htm#fr_545) The nature of the faculty of understanding; and\ncourage is the firmness of that faculty.\n\n[125:3](sbe0820.htm#fr_546) See [p. 115](sbe0818.htm#page_115). _S_ a _n_ kara\ntakes these to mean the 'paths' of action and knowledge, and Nilaka _nth_ a\ntakes the next expression to mean that which is constant and that which is not\nconstant--nitya, anitya.\n\n[125:4](sbe0820.htm#fr_547) Always co-existing with mental abstraction and\nsupporting it.\n\n[125:5](sbe0820.htm#fr_548) Three of the aims of mankind, the highest being\nfinal emancipation. In the view of the Gita, piety, leading only to heaven, is\nof doubtful benefit.\n\n[125:6](sbe0820.htm#fr_549) I. e. to the action for attaining them, in the\nbelief that one is p. 126 the doer of it; the 'fruit' scil. of the action\nperformed with an eye to the three things named.\n\n[126:1](sbe0820.htm#fr_550) Not at once, as in the case of sensuous pleasures.\n\n[126:2](sbe0820.htm#fr_551) Cf. [p. 51](sbe0804.htm#page_51). The original has\nalso been rendered by 'tranquillity of one's own mind.'\n\n[126:3](sbe0820.htm#fr_552) Cf. [p. 59](sbe0806.htm#page_59).\n\n[126:4](sbe0820.htm#fr_553) I. e. resulting from control of the mind, purity\nhere is both external and internal. And see [p. 119](sbe0819.htm#page_119).\n\n[127:1](sbe0820.htm#fr_554) I. e. in battle, Nilaka _nth_ a seems to say. _S_\na _n_ kara says it means ready resource whenever occasion arises.\n\n[127:2](sbe0820.htm#fr_555) I. e. 'power to restrain people from going\nastray.' Nilaka _nth_ a.\n\n[127:3](sbe0820.htm#fr_556) Eligibility for the path of knowledge.\n\n[127:4](sbe0820.htm#fr_557) Cf. [p. 56](sbe0805.htm#page_56).\n\n[127:5](sbe0820.htm#fr_558) Cf. [p. 121](sbe0819.htm#page_121); the evil\nappears to be the quality of 'fettering' the soul.\n\n[127:6](sbe0820.htm#fr_559) _S_ ridhara compares [p. 65](sbe0807.htm#page_65)\n(V. 13) and distinguishes this from [p. 64](sbe0807.htm#page_64) (V, 8 seq.)\n_S_ a _n_ kara says the perfection here spoken of is emancipation, and it is\nobtained by true knowledge.\n\n[128:1](sbe0820.htm#fr_560) Abstraction is concentrated and exclusive\nmeditation, _S_ a _n_ kara. The other commentators take dhyanayoga as\nmeditation simply,--as treated of in chapter VI, says Nilaka _nth_ a.\n\n[128:2](sbe0820.htm#fr_561) See [p. 52](sbe0804.htm#page_52).\n\n[128:3](sbe0820.htm#fr_562) I. e. comprehending his identity with the Brahman.\n\n[128:4](sbe0820.htm#fr_563) Cf. [p. 55](sbe0805.htm#page_55).\n\n[128:5](sbe0820.htm#fr_564) Pride of learning and cleverness, or of piety. See\np. 124, note .\n\n[128:6](sbe0820.htm#fr_565) The nature of a Kshatriya, _S_ a _n_ kara.\n\n[129:1](sbe0820.htm#fr_566) _S_ veta _s_ vatara-upanishad, pp. 333-345; Ka\n_th_ opanishad, p. 157.\n\n[129:2](sbe0820.htm#fr_567) Cf.

Cf. last stanza of\n_S_ veta _s_ vataropanishad.\n\n[129:7](sbe0820.htm#fr_572) Cf. [p. 62](sbe0806.htm#page_62). _S_ a _n_ kara\nsays all these elements must co-exist to give eligibility.\n\n[129:8](sbe0820.htm#fr_573) I. e. belief that in disseminating it, he is\nserving me. Cf. Ka _th_ opanishad, p. 120.\n\n[130:1](sbe0820.htm#fr_574) Which is the best of sacrifices; see [p.\n62](sbe0806.htm#page_62).\n\n[130:2](sbe0820.htm#fr_575) Cf.
