And on account of the exclusion of (what is of) another nature (than\nBrahman).\n\nAnother nature, i. e. the nature of the Pradhana, and so on. A supplementary\npassage excludes difference on the part of the Imperishable from the supreme\nPerson. 'That Imperishable, O Gargi, is unseen but seeing; unheard but\nhearing; unthought but thinking; unknown but knowing. There is nothing that\nsees but it, nothing that hears but it, nothing that thinks but it, nothing\nthat knows but it. In that Imperishable, O Gargi, the ether is woven, warp and\nwoof.' Here the declaration as to the Imperishable being what sees, hears, &c.\nexcludes the non-intelligent Pradhana; and the declaration as to its being\nall-seeing, &c. while not\n\np. 311\n\nseen by any one excludes the individual soul. This exclusion of what has a\nnature other than that of the highest Self thus confirms the view of that Self\nbeing meant.--Or else the Sutra may be explained in a different way, viz. 'On\naccount of the exclusion of the existence of another.' On this alternative the\ntext 'There is nothing that sees but it,' &c., is to be understood as follows:\n'while this Imperishable, not seen by others but seeing all others, forms the\nbasis of all things different from itself; there is no other principle which,\nunseen by the Imperishable but seeing it, could form _its_ basis,' i.e. the\ntext would exclude the existence of any other thing but the Imperishable, and\nthus implicitly deny that the Imperishable is either the Pradhana or the\nindividual Self.--Moreover the text 'By the command of that Imperishable men\npraise those who give, the gods follow the Sacrficer, the fathers the Darvi-\noffering,' declares the Imperishable to be that on the command of which there\nproceed all works enjoined by Scripture and Sm _ri_ ti. such as sacrificing,\ngiving, &c., and this again shows that the Imperishable must be Brahman, the\nsupreme Person. Again, the subsequent _passus_ , 'Whosoever without knowing\nthat Imperishable,' &c., declares that ignorance of the Imperishable leads to\nthe Sa _m_ sara, while knowledge of it helps to reach Immortality: this also\nproves that the Imperishable is the highest Brahman.--Here terminates the\nadhikara _n_ a of 'the Imperishable.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 12.
