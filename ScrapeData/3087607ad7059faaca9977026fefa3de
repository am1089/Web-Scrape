O you whose eyes are like lotus leaves! I\nhave heard from you at large about the production and dissolution of things,\nand also about your inexhaustible greatness. O highest lord! what you have\nsaid about yourself is so. I wish, O best of beings! to see your divine form.\nIf, O lord! you think that it is possible for me to look upon it, then, O lord\nof the possessors of mystic power 1! show your inexhaustible form to me.\n\nThe Deity said:\n\nIn hundreds and in thousands see my forms, O son of P _ri_ tha! various,\ndivine, and of various colours and shapes. See the \xc3\x82dityas, Vasus, Rudras, the\ntwo A _s_ vins, and Maruts likewise. And O descendant of Bharata! see wonders,\nin numbers, unseen before. Within my body, O Gu _d_ akesa! see to-day the\nwhole universe, including (everything) movable and immovable, (all) in one,\nand whatever else you wish to see. But you will not be able to see me with\nmerely, this eye of yours. I give you an eye divine. (Now) see my divine\npower.\n\nSa\xc3\xb1 _g_ aya said\n\nHaving spoken thus, O king! Hari, the great\n\np. 93\n\nlord of the possessors of mystic power, then showed to the son of P _ri_ tha.\nhis supreme divine form, having many mouths and eyes, having (within it) many\nwonderful sights, having many celestial ornaments, having many celestial\nweapons held erect, wearing celestial flowers and vestments, having an\nanointment of celestial perfumes, full of every wonder, the infinite deity\nwith faces in all directions 1. If in the heavens, the lustre of a thousand\nsuns burst forth all at once, that would be like the lustre of that mighty\none. There the son of Pa _nd_ u then observed in the body of the god of gods\nthe whole universe (all) in one, and divided into numerous 2 (divisions). Then\nDhana\xc3\xb1 _g_ aya filled with amazement, and with hair standing on end, bowed his\nhead before the god, and spoke with joined hands.\n\nAr _g_ una said:\n\nO god! I see within your body the gods, as also all the groups of various\nbeings; and the lord Brahman seated on (his) lotus seat, and all the sages and\ncelestial snakes. I see you, who are of countless forms, possessed of many\narms, stomachs, mouths, and eyes on all sides. And, O lord of the universe! O\nyou of all forms! I do not see your end or middle or beginning. I see you\nbearing a coronet and a mace and a discus--a mass of glory, brilliant on all\nsides, difficult to look at, having on\n\np. 94\n\nall sides the effulgence of a blazing fire or sun, and indefinable. You are\nindestructible, the supreme one to be known. You are the highest support 1 of\nthis universe. You are the inexhaustible protector of everlasting piety. I\nbelieve you to be the eternal being. I see you void of beginning, middle, end\n--of infinite power, of unnumbered arms, having the sun and moon for eyes,\nhaving a mouth like a blazing fire, and heating the universe with your\nradiance. For this space between heaven and earth and all the quarters are\npervaded by you alone. Looking at this wonderful and terrible form of yours, O\nhigh-souled one! the three worlds are affrighted. For here these groups of\ngods are entering into you. Some being afraid are praying with joined hands,\nand the groups of great sages and Siddhas are saying 'Welfare 2!' and praising\nyou with abundant (hymns) of praise. The Rudras, and \xc3\x82dityas, the Vasus, the\nSadhyas, the Vi _s_ vas, the two A _s_ vins, the Maruts, and the Ushmapas, and\nthe groups of Gandharvas, Yakshas, demons, and Siddhas are all looking at you\namazed. Seeing your mighty form, with many mouths and eyes, with many arms,\nthighs, and feet, with many stomachs, and fearful with many jaws, all people,\nand I likewise, are much alarmed, O you of mighty arms! Seeing you, O Vish _n_\nu! touching the skies, radiant, possessed of many hues, with a gaping mouth,\nand with large blazing eyes, I am much alarmed in my inmost self, and feel no\ncourage, no tranquillity.\n\np. 95\n\n[paragraph continues] And seeing your mouths terrible by the jaws, and\nresembling the fire of destruction, I cannot recognise the (various)\ndirections, I feel no comfort. Be gracious, O lord of gods! who pervadest the\nuniverse. And all these sons of Dh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra, together with all the\nbands of kings, and Bhishma and Dro _n_ a, and this charioteer's son 1\nlikewise, together with our principal warriors also, are rapidly entering your\nmouths, fearful and horrific 2 by (reason of your) jaws. And some with their\nheads smashed are seen (to be) stuck in the spaces between the teeth. As the\nmany rapid currents of a river's waters run towards the sea alone, so do these\nheroes of the human world enter your mouths blazing all round. As butterflies,\nwith increased velocity, enter a blazing fire to their destruction, so too do\nthese people enter your mouths with increased velocity (only) to their\ndestruction. Swallowing all these people, you are licking them over and over\nagain from all sides, with your blazing mouths. Your fierce splendours, O Vish\n_n_ u! filling the whole universe with (their) effulgence, are heating it.\nTell me who you are in this fierce form. Salutations be to thee, O chief of\nthe gods! Be gracious. I wish to know you, the primeval, one, for I do not\nunderstand your actions.\n\nThe Deity said:\n\nI am death, the destroyer of the worlds, fully developed, and I am now active\nabout the overthrow\n\np. 96\n\nof the worlds. Even without you, the warriors standing in the adverse hosts,\nshall all cease to be. Therefore, be up, obtain glory, and vanquishing (your)\nfoes, enjoy a prosperous kingdom. All these have been already killed by me. Be\nonly the instrument, O Savyasa _k_ in 1! Dro _n_ a, and Bhishma, and _G_\nayadratha, and Kar _n_ a, and likewise other valiant warriors also, whom I\nhave killed, do you kill. Be not alarmed. Do fight. And in the battle you will\nconquer your foes.\n\nSa\xc3\xb1 _g_ aya said:\n\nHearing these words of Kesava, the wearer of the coronet 2, trembling, and\nwith joined hands, bowed down; and sorely afraid, and with throat choked up,\nhe again spoke to K _ri_ sh _n_ a after saluting him.\n\nAr _g_ una said:\n\nIt is quite proper, O H _ri_ shike _s_ a! that the universe is delighted and\ncharmed by your renown, that the demons run away affrighted in all directions,\nand that all the assemblages of Siddhas bow down,(to you). And why, O high-\nsouled one! should they not bow down to you (who are) greater than Brahman,\nand first cause? O infinite lord of gods! O you pervading the universe! you\nare the indestructible, that which is, that which is not, and what is beyond\nthem 3. You are the primal\n\np. 97\n\ngod, the ancient being, you are the highest support of this universe 1. You\nare that which has knowledge, that which is the object of knowledge, you are\nthe highest goal. By you is this universe pervaded., O you of infinite forms!\nYou are the wind, Yama, fire, Varu _n_ a, the moon, you Pra _g_ apati, and the\ngreat grandsire 2. Obeisance be to thee a thousand times, and again and again\nobeisance to thee! In front and from behind obeisance to thee! Obeisance be to\nthee from all sides, O you who are all! You are of infinite power, of\nunmeasured glory; you pervade all, and therefore you are all! Whatever I have\nsaid contemptuously,--for instance, 'O K _ri_ sh _n_ a!' 'O Yadava!' 'O\nfriend!'--thinking you to be (my) friend, and not knowing your greatness (as\nshown in) this (universal form), or through friendliness, or incautiously; and\nwhatever disrespect I have shown you for purposes of merriment, on (occasions\nof) play, sleep, dinner, or sitting (together), whether alone or in the\npresence (of friends),--for all that, O undegraded one! I ask pardon of you\nwho are indefinable 3. You are the father of the world-movable and immovable,\n--you its great and venerable master; there is none equal to you, whence can\nthere be one greater, O you whose power is unparalleled in all the three\nworlds? Therefore I bow and prostrate myself, and would propitiate you, the\npraiseworthy lord. Be pleased,\n\np. 98\n\n[paragraph continues] O god! to pardon (my guilt) as a father (that of his)\nson, a friend (that of his) friend, or a husband (that of his) beloved. I am\ndelighted at seeing what I had never seen before, and my heart is also alarmed\nby fear. Show me that same form, O god! Be gracious, O lord of gods! O you\npervading the universe! I wish to see you bearing the coronet and the mace,\nwith the discus in hand, just the same (as before) 1. O you of thousand arms!\nO you of all forms! assume that same four-handed form.\n\nThe Deity said:\n\nO Ar _g_ una! being pleased (with you), I have by my own mystic power shown\nyou this supreme form, full of glory, universal, infinite, primeval, and which\nhas not been seen before by any one else but you, O you hero among the\nKauravas! I cannot be seen in this form by any one but you, (even) by (the\nhelp of) the study of the Vedas, or of 2 sacrifices, nor by gifts, nor by\nactions, nor by fierce penances. Be not alarmed, be not perplexed, at seeing\nthis form of mine, fearful like this. Free from fear and with delighted heart,\nsee now again that same form of mine.\n\nSa\xc3\xb1 _g_ aya said:\n\nHaving thus spoken to Ar _g_ una, Vasudeva again showed his own form, and the\nhigh-souled one becoming again of a mild form, comforted him who had been\naffrighted.\n\np. 99\n\nAr _g_ una said:\n\nO _G_ anardana! seeing this mild, human form of yours, I am new in my right\nmind, and have come to my normal state.\n\nThe Deity said:\n\nEven the gods are always desiring to see this form of mine, which it is\ndifficult to get a sight of, and which you have seen. I cannot be seen, as you\nhave seen me, by (means of) the Vedas, not by penance, not by gift, nor yet by\nsacrifice. But, O Ar _g_ una! by devotion to me exclusively, I can in this\nform be truly known, seen, and assimilated [1](sbe0814.htm#fn_402) with, O\nterror of your foes! He who performs acts for (propitiating) me, to whom I am\nthe highest (object), who is my devotee, who is free from attachment, and who\nhas no enmity towards any being, he, O son of Pa _nd_ u! comes to me.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[92:1](sbe0813.htm#fr_388) Madhusudana takes power to mean capacity of\nbecoming small or great, of obtaining what is wanted, &c.; the so-called eight\nBhutis.\n\n[93:1](sbe0813.htm#fr_389) Cf. [p. 90](sbe0812.htm#page_90) supra. _S_ a _n_\nkara explains it as meaning 'pervading everything.' The expression occurs in\nthe N _ri_ simha-tapini-upanishad, p. 50, where it is said, 'as, without\norgans, it sees, hears, goes, takes from all sides and pervades everything,\ntherefore it has faces on all sides.'\n\n[93:2](sbe0813.htm#fr_390) Gods, manes, men, and so forth.\n\n[94:1](sbe0813.htm#fr_391) The words are the same as at p. 97 infra, where see\nthe note.\n\n[94:2](sbe0813.htm#fr_392) Seeing signs of some great cataclysm, they say,\n'May it be well with the universe,' and then proceed to pray to you.\n\n[95:1](sbe0813.htm#fr_393) I. e. Kar _n_ a, who was really the eldest brother\nof the Pa _nd_ avas, but having been immediately on birth abandoned by Kunti,\nwas brought up by a charioteer. Kar _n_ a was told of his, true origin by\nBhishma on his deathbed, and advised to join the Pa _nd_ avas, but he\ndeclined.\n\n[95:2](sbe0813.htm#fr_394) By reason of the ruggedness and distortion of face.\n\n[96:1](sbe0813.htm#fr_395) Ar _g_ una, as he could shoot with his left hand as\nwell as the right.-- _S_ ridhara.\n\n[96:2](sbe0813.htm#fr_396) Ar _g_ una, who had this coronet given him by\nIndra.--Madhusudana.\n\n[96:3](sbe0813.htm#fr_397) The commentators interpret this to mean the\nperceptible, the unperceived, and the higher principle. Cf. [p.\n84](sbe0811.htm#page_84) supra, and also pp. [103](sbe0815.htm#page_103),\n[113](sbe0817.htm#page_113) infra and notes there.\n\n[97:1](sbe0813.htm#fr_398) See p. 94 supra. Here the commentators say the\nwords mean 'that in which the universe is placed at deluge-time.'\n\n[97:2](sbe0813.htm#fr_399) Professor Tiele mentions great-grandfather as a\nname for the Creator among Kaffirs (History of Religion, p. 18). Cf. [p.\n83](sbe0811.htm#page_83) supra.\n\n[97:3](sbe0813.htm#fr_400) I. e. of whom it is impossible to ascertain whether\nhe is such or such. Cf. p. 94 supra.\n\n[98:1](sbe0813.htm#fr_401) This is the ordinary form of K _ri_ sh _n_ a.\n\n[98:2](sbe0813.htm#fr_402) This is the original construction. One suspects\nthat sacrifices and study of the Vedas are meant. Cf. the speech of K _ri_ sh\n_n_ a on the next page.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XII](sbe0814.htm)\n\n"
