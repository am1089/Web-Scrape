I cared very little\nfor the body. My longing for the Divine Mother was so great that I would not\neat or sleep. I would lie on the bare ground, placing my head on a lump of\nearth, and cry out loudly: "Mother, Mother, why dost Thou not come to me?" I\ndid not know how the days and nights passed away. I used to have ecstasy all\nthe time. I saw my disciples as my own people, like children and relations,\nlong before they came to me. I used to cry before my Mother, saying: "O\nMother! I am dying for my beloved ones (Bhaktas); do Thou bring them to me as\nquickly as possible."\n\np. 208\n\nAll desires fulfilled.At that time whatever I desired came to pass. Once I\ndesired to build a small hut in the Panchavati * for meditation and to put a\nfence around it. Immediately after I saw a huge bundle of bamboo sticks, rope,\nstrings and even a knife, all brought by the tide in front of the Panchavati.\nA servant of the Temple, seeing these things, ran to me with great delight and\ntold me of them. There was the exact quantity of material necessary for the\nhut and the fence. When they were built, nothing remained over. Everyone was\namazed to see this wonderful sight.\n\nWhen I reached the state of continuous ecstasy, I gave up all external forms\nof worship; I could no longer perform them. Then I prayed to my Divine Mother:\n"Mother, who will now take care of me? I have no power to take care of myself.\nI like to hear Thy name and feed Thy Bhaktas and help the poor. Who will make\nit possible for me to do these things? Send me someone who will be able to do\nthese for me." As the answer to this prayer came Mathura Babu, \xe2\x80\xa0 who served me\nso long and\n\np. 209\n\nwith such intense devotion and faith! Again at another time I said to the\nMother: "I shall have no child of my own, but I wish to have as my child a\npitre Bhakta, who will stay with me all the time. Send me such an one." Then\ncame Rakhal (Brahmananda).\n\nThose who are my own are parts of my very Self.\n\nii\n\nVisit to Zoological Garden. In referring to the time of joyous illumination\nwhich immediately followed His enlightenment, He exclaimed:\n\nWhat a state it was! The slightest cause aroused in me the thought of the\nDivine Ideal. One day I went to the Zoological Garden in Calcutta. I desired\nespecially to see the lion, but when I beheld him, I lost all sense-\nconsciousness and went into Samadhi. Those who were with me wished to show me\nthe other animals, but I replied: "I saw everything when I saw the king of\nbeasts. Take me home." The strength of the lion had aroused in me the\nconsciousness of the\n\np. 210\n\nomnipotence of God and had lifted me above the world of phenomena.\n\nDivinity everywhere.Another day I went to the parade-ground to see the\nascension of a balloon. Suddenly my eyes fell upon a young English boy leaning\nagainst a tree. The very posture of his body brought before me the vision of\nthe form of Krishna and I went into Samadhi.\n\nAgain I saw a woman wearing a blue garment under a tree. She was a harlot. As\nI looked at her, instantly the ideal of Sita * appeared before me! I forgot\nthe existence of the harlot, but saw before me pure and spotless Sita,\napproaching Rama, the Incarnation of Divinity, and for a long time I remained\nmotionless. I worshipped all women as representatives of the Divine Mother. I\nrealized the Mother of the universe in every woman\'s form.\n\nMathura Babu, the son-in-law of Rashmoni, invited me to stay in his house for\na few days. At that time I felt so strongly that I was the maid-servant of my\nDivine Mother that I thought of myself as a woman. The ladies of the house had\nthe same feeling; they did not\n\np. 211\n\nlook upon me as a man. As women are free before a young girl, so were they\nbefore me. My mind was above the consciousness of sex.\n\nWhat a Divine state it was! I could not eat here in the Temple. I would walk\nfrom place to place and enter into the house of strangers after their meal\nhour. I would sit there quietly, without uttering a word. When questioned, I\nwould say, "I wish to eat here." Immediately they would feed me with the best\nthings they had.\n\nVisit to a poor Brahmin.Once I heard of a poor Brahmin who was a true devotee\nand who lived in a small hut in Baghbazar. I desired to see him, so I asked\nMathura Babu to take me to him. He consented, immediately ordered a large\ncarriage and drove me there. The Brahmin\'s house was so small that he scarcely\nhad room to receive us, and he was much surprised to see me coming with such a\nrich man in such carriage!\n\nAt another time I wished to meet Devendra Nath Tagore. * He is a very rich\nman, but in\n\np. 212\n\nVisit to Devendra Nath Tagore.spite of his enormous wealth he is devoted to\nGod and repeats His Holy Name. For this reason I desired to know him. I spoke\nabout him to Mathura Babu. He replied: "Very well, Baba, I will take Thee to\nhim; he was my classmate." So he took me and introduced me to him, saying:\n"This holy man has come to see you. He is mad after God." I saw in him a\nlittle pride and egotism. It is natural for a man who has so much wealth,\nculture, fame and social position. I said to Mathura Babu: "Tell me, does\npride spring from true wisdom or from ignorance? He who has attained to the\nhighest knowledge of Brahman cannot possess pride or egotism, such as \'I am\nlearned,\' \'I am wise,\' \'I am rich,\' and so on." While I was speaking with\nDevendra Nath Tagore, I went into a state from where I could see the true\ncharacter of every individual. In this state the most\n\np. 213\n\nlearned pandits and scholars appear to me like blades of grass. When I see\nthat scholars have neither true discrimination nor dispassion, then I feel\nthat they are like straws; or they seem like vultures who soar high in the\nheavens, but keep their minds on the charnel-pits below on the earth. In\nDevendra I found both spiritual knowledge and worldly desire. He has a number\nof children, some of whom are quite young. A doctor was present. I said: "When\nyou have so much spiritual knowledge, how can you live constantly in the midst\nof so much worldliness? You are like Raja Janaka; you can keep your mind on\nGod, remaining amid worldly pleasures and luxury. Therefore I have come to see\nyou. Tell me something of the Divine Being." Devendra then read some passages\nfrom the Vedas and said: "This world is like a chandelier, and each Jiva\n(individual soul) is like a light in it." Long ago, when I spent nearly all my\ntime meditating at the Panchavati, I saw the same thing. When Devendra\'s words\nharmonized with my experience, I knew that he must have attained to some true\nknowledge. I asked him to explain. He said: "Who would have known this world?\nGod has created man to manifest His glory. If there\n\np. 214\n\nwere no light in the chandelier, it would be all dark. The chandelier itself\nwould not be visible." After a long conversation Devendra Nath Tagore begged\nme to come to the anniversary of the Brahmo-Samaj. I answered: "If it be the\nwill of the Lord. I go wherever He takes me."\n\niv\n\nVisit to Padmalochana.Padmalochana was the most eminent scholar in the court\nof the Raja of Burdwan. He came to a garden-house near Dakshineswara, and as I\nhad a desire to meet him, I sent Hridai to find out whether he had pride or\nnot. I learned that he was simple and absolutely free from scholarly pride, so\nI went to see him. He was indeed a great scholar and a true Jnani. He defeated\nall the great pandits and theologians. He said that when he was in the court\nof the Raja a theological discussion arose regarding the Hindu Trinity,--\nwhether the first person of the Trinity, Brahma, was greater than the third\nperson of the Trinity, Shiva. The pandits referred to him for the final\ndecision and Padmalochana replied: "I have seen neither Brahma nor Shiva; how\ncan I decide?" He wished to hear me sing the\n\np. 215\n\npraises of my Divine Mother. I had a long conversation with him. He became\ntruly devoted to me and said: "I have never found so much happiness anywhere."\nHe revered me although I used to cry for my Divine Mother like a child.\n\nv\n\nDistaste for Worldly conversation.Nothing but discourses on God appealed to me\nat this period. If I heard worldly conversation, I would sit in a corner and\nweep bitterly. When I went with Mathura Babu to Benares, I was sitting with\nhim in the drawing-room when some friends came in to see him and began to\ndiscuss worldly affairs. "So much we have gained, so much we have lost."\nHearing this I was in tears and cried aloud: "Mother, why hast Thou brought me\nhere? I was much better off in the Temple. I have come to the Holy City to\nhear only of lust and gold; but there in the Temple I did not have to listen\nto such conversation."\n\nI was at this time like a young boy and so Mathura Babu fulfilled all the\ndesires that arose in my mind. My heart and soul, however, were constantly\nlonging to hear about the\n\np. 216\n\nLonging to hear about the Supreme.[paragraph continues] Supreme Being. I\nsearched for the places where the Holy Scriptures were expounded. There was a\nBrahmin in the neighborhood who was a great pandit and who had true faith. I\nused to go to hear him very often. A saint lived near by on the bank of the\nGanges and I wished to go with this Brahmin to see him; but a priest who\nlooked upon the world as a dream discouraged me by saying: "The body of a\nsaint is an earthly cage; what good can one obtain by visiting such a cage?" I\nspoke of this to the Brahmin and he replied: "He who thinks of God, he who\nrepeats His Holy Name and has renounced everything for the sake of the Lord,\nmust not be regarded as an earthly cage. The priest does not know that the\nform of a devotee is a spiritual form full of Divine intelligence." This\nBrahmin once asked me why I had thrown away my Brahminical thread. I replied:\n"When the storm of Divine ecstasy overtook my heart and soul, it blew away all\nsigns of caste and creed. If you once become mad after God, then you will\nunderstand me." But after some time this Brahmin himself caught the madness of\nDivine ecstasy. He would utter nothing but "Om, Om," and sit in silence in his\nown room. He\n\np. 217\n\nwould not mix with or speak to anyone. His friends and relatives called in\nphysicians. He told one of them: "You can cure my disease, but do not take my\n\'Om\' from me." Once I went to see him when he was in this state. I asked him\nwhat was the matter and he answered: "The tax-collectors have been here and I\nam wondering what I shall do. They said that they would seize my belongings."\nI replied: "What will you gain by thinking in this way? Let them sell your\nbelongings. If they put you in jail, they cannot harm you, because you say\nthat you are nothing but (Kha) infinite space." I would often repeat this, his\nown statement, to him and say: "As you are infinite space, no tax can be drawn\nout of you."\n\nvi\n\nAbsolute frankness.During this period I was absolutely outspoken. I observed\nno formality or etiquette; I was fearless. Once I met a rich Zemindar and\nasked him: "What is our highest duty? Is not the attainment of God our highest\nduty?" He replied: "We are men of the world; salvation is not for us. When\n\np. 218\n\neven Yudhisthira, * the purest and most perfect of mortals, had to see\npurgatory in a vision because he had once wavered for half a second from\nabsolute Truth, what can we expect for ourselves?" I could not bear his words\nand rebuked him sharply, saying: "What kind of man are you, that you think of\nthe momentary vision of purgatory? You must not think of that, but of\nYudhisthira\'s truthfulness, forgiveness, patience, right discrimination,\nrenunciation, devotion and love for God."\n\nAt another time I went to see a Zemindar who had the title of Raja, and I told\nhim plainly that I could not call him Raja because he was not really one.\n\nOne day I saw a pious Brahmin who was counting his beads on the bank of the\nGanges. I stood near him and knew that his mind was not fixed on God but on\nearthly things. Immediately I roused him by striking him on the shoulder. At\nanother time Rashmoni, the founder of the Temple, was praying in the Temple\nwhile I was singing the holy song of the Divine Mother. I perceived that her\nmind was\n\np. 219\n\non worldly objects and instantly I roused her in the same manner. In amazement\nshe folded her hands and remained motionless before me.\n\nvii\n\nVisit to Keshab Sen.Keshab Chunder Sen was suffering from a serious illness.\nBhagavan Sri Ramakrishna was very anxious to see him, so He came one day with\na few of His disciples to Keshab\'s home, where He was received by some of\nKeshab\'s disciples. They led Him to the drawing-room and seated Him on a\ncouch. The room was fitted up with modern furniture. The Bhagavan looked at it\nfor a moment; then His mind turned within and He went into Samadhi. After\nrecovering sense-consciousness, He spoke thus:\n\nBody and \xc3\x82tman.There are two, the physical body and the \xc3\x82tman; the body is\nborn, so it must die, but \xc3\x82tman is deathless. It is separate from the body,\nlike a nut in the shell; but when the nut is unripe, it is difficult to\nseparate the kernel from the shell; so it is with worldly people who have not\nrealized God. Their \xc3\x82tman remains attached to the body; but in true knowledge\nthe \xc3\x82tman appears as separate from the body.\n\np. 220\n\nAt this moment Keshab entered the room. He was extremely thin and looked\nalmost like a skeleton. He could hardly stand on his feet. With great\ndifficulty he walked to the couch and sat at the feet of Bhagavan Sri\nRamakrishna. The Bhagavan came down from the couch and sat on the floor.\nKeshab touched his forehead to the floor and remained prostrate before Him for\nsome time. Ramakrishna held Keshab\'s hand and said:\n\nPerfect knowledge brings realization of oneness.So long as there is knowledge\nof variety, so long there is bondage. When perfect knowledge comes, man\nrealizes one Spirit in all. In that state he also sees that the same One has\nbecome the individual soul, and the phenomenal world with its various states\nand elements. It is true that the Universal Spirit dwells everywhere, but His\nmanifestation varies. In some places there is greater manifestation and in\nothers less. Wherever there is greater manifestation of the Spirit, there is\nalso greater manifestation of Divine Powers.\n\nFirst you will have to realize unity by discrimination: "Not this, not this."\nThen after reaching this state of realization, when you come down to\nphenomena, you will discover that\n\np. 221\n\nUnity and variety.variety has come from unity and the same unity is the goal\nof variety. The difference in the manifestation of Sakti or power makes the\nvariety. When the flood of spiritual realization comes in the soul, like a\nsheet of water the Universal Spirit covers everything. All distinctions\nvanish. Then a boat can pass over a field and the way from one place to\nanother becomes straight across the water.\n\nKeshab was listening with rapt attention. Although the room was crowded,\nabsolute silence prevailed. The Bhagavan, looking at Keshab, then asked:\n\nMeaning of Keshab\'s illness.How are you? How do you feel? You are suffering;\nbut your illness has a deep meaning. In this body you have gone through\nvarious stages of spiritual development; the body is now suffering from the\nreaction. When the spiritual waves arise, the consciousness of the body\nvanishes; but it tells upon the body in the end. When a big steamer plies in\nthe waters of the Ganges, I have seen the waves dash against the shore for\nsome time after; the larger the boat, the stronger the waves; sometimes they\nbreak down the banks. If an elephant enters a small hut,\n\np. 222\n\nit shakes it and breaks it to pieces; so when the elephant of the spiritual\nIdeal enters into the body, it shakes and sometimes shatters it. What happens;\ndo you know? If there be a fire in the house, it burns up many things.\nSimilarly, the fire of Divine Wisdom burns all passion, anger and other\nenemies, and in the end destroys the sense of "I, me and mine." The body is\nthen wrenched and shattered. You may think that everything is finished, but so\nlong as there is the least sign of illness, so long Re will not make you free.\nIf you enroll yourself as a patient in a hospital, you cannot come out before\nyou are absolutely cured.\n\nKeshab began to smile. The Bhagavan continued: Hridai used to say, after\nseeing the condition of my body: "I have never seen so much spirituality with\nsuch a state of body!" But although my body was weak, still I never stopped\ntalking of God with others. At one time, I remember, I was thin like a\nskeleton, yet I would continue discussions on spiritual subjects for hours.\n\nThen shedding tears of sympathy for Keshab, the Bhagavan said: It is His will.\nEverything happens by Thy will O Lord! Thou doest Thy\n\np. 223\n\nEverything the will of God.work; by mistake people say, "I do." The gardener\nsometimes uncovers the of roots rose-bushes that the dew may fall upon them.\nSometimes he trims off some of the roots so that the flowers will become\nlarger. Perhaps the Lord is preparing you to do greater work. But I feel very\nunhappy when you are ill. Last time when you were ill, I was so anxious about\nyou that I would cry at night and pray to my Divine Mother for your recovery.\nSometimes I said to my Mother: "If Keshab passes away, with whom shall I talk\nabout God?" But this time I do not feel the same way.\n\nAt this moment Keshab\'s aged mother came near the door and addressed the\nBhagavan, saying: "May Keshab be cured of his illness?"\n\nThe Bhagavan replied: Pray to my blissful Divine Mother. She will remove all\npain and trouble. (To Keshab) Do not spend so much time with your family and\nchildren. Their company will drag you to worldliness. You will feel better if\nyou think of God and talk about Him.\n\nKeshab\'s mother said: Do Thou bless my Keshab.\n\nRamakrishna: What power have I? God\n\np. 224\n\nwill bless him. Thou doest Thy work, O Divine Mother! People say by mistake,\n"I do it." Two are the occasions when the Lord smiles. First, when brothers\nremove the chains which partition off the family property, saying: "This is\nmine and that is thine"; and secondly, when the physician of a dying patient\ndeclares: "I shall make him live."\n\n\n\nKeshab then began to cough and could not remain longer, so he bowed down\nbefore the Bhagavan, saluted Him, and with great difficulty walked out of the\nroom. Keshab\'s eldest son was there. A Brahmo devotee said: Bhagavan, lay Thy\nhand on his head and bless him.\n\nRamakrishna replied: It is not for me to bless anyone.\n\nHe then gently touched him on his arm and said to the Brahmo devotee: I cannot\nsay to anyone, "Be thou cured." I never asked my Divine Mother for that power.\nI simply ask for pure love and nothing else.\n\nSri Ramakrishna then rose to leave. Keshab\'s disciples accompanied Him to the\ndoor with great reverence, and He passed from the house with His disciples.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[208:*](gork10.htm#fr_61) Five sacred trees planted together to form a grove\nto be used for contemplation.\n\n[208:\xe2\x80\xa0](gork10.htm#fr_62) Mathura Babu was the son-in-law of Rani Rashmoni, p.\n209 the founder of the Temple garden at Dakshineswara.
