When he had performed it, he felt like one emptied out. He saw\nthis sacrificial performance, the Sautrama _n_ i, and performed it, and then\nhe was again replenished; and, indeed, he who performs the Soma-sacrifice is,\nas it were, emptied out, for his wealth, his prosperity is, as it were, taken\nfrom him.\n\n12:8:2:22\\. Having performed a Soma-sacrifice one ought to perform the\nSautrama _n_ i: as a cow that has been milked would replenish again, even so,\nindeed, does he replenish himself,--he replenishes himself by offspring and\ncattle; and, verily, he who, knowing this, performs the Sautrama _n_ i, or he\nwho (even) knows this, establishes himself in this world, and wins the\nheavenly world.\n\n12:8:2:33\\. As to this Suplan Sar _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ aya asked Pratidar _s_ a Aibhavata\n2, 'Seeing that neither does one\n\np. 240\n\nbecome initiated, nor are Soma-shoots 1 thrown down (to be pressed), how then\ndoes the Sautrama _n_ i become a Soma-sacrifice?'\n\n12:8:2:44\\. He replied, 'The observance of the fast, assuredly, is the head of\nthe sacrifice, and the initiation its body. And the truth, doubtless, is of\nthe form of the fast-observance, and faith of that of the initiation. And mind\nis of the form of the Sacrificer, and speech of that of the sacrifice.'\n\n12:8:2:55\\. Thus, when he enters upon the fast-observance, he thereby restores\nthe head to the body of the sacrifice, and he puts truth into faith, and the\nSacrificer into the sacrifice.\n\n12:8:2:66\\. Therefore at this sacrifice (the Sautrama _n_ i) the fast-\nobservance 2 is the initiation. Now, the fast-observance is a male, and the\ninitiation a female; and the truth is a male, and faith a female; and the mind\nis a male, and speech a female; and the Sacrificer is the male to his wife,\nwhence wherever there is a husband there is a wife: and at the very outset of\nthe sacrifice he thus sets up couples with a view to production.\n\n12:8:2:77\\. 'And, indeed, those (materials) are the Soma-shoots at this\nsacrifice,' they say, 'to wit, the malted rice, the malted barley, and the\nfried rice.'\n\n12:8:2:88\\. The malted rice 3, indeed, is of the form of the\n\np. 241\n\nmorning-pressing, for the morning-pressing is this (terrestrial) world, and\nthe latter relates to the A _s_ vins, and \xc3\x82 _s_ vina milk he pours (into the\nSura-liquor) the first night: he thus provides him (the Sacrificer 1) with the\nmorning-pressing--with its own world, with its own deity, with its own form 2.\n\n12:8:2:99\\. And the malted barley is of the form of the midday-pressing, for\nthe midday-pressing is the air, and the latter relates to Sarasvati 3, and the\nSarasvata milk he pours (into the Sura) the second night: he thus provides him\nwith the midday-pressing--with its own world, with its own deity, with its own\nform.\n\n12:8:2:1010\\. And the fried rice is of the form of the evening-pressing, for\nthe evening-pressing is the sky, and the latter relates to Indra, and Aindra\nmilk he pours (into the Sura) the third night: he thus provides him with the\nevening-pressing--with its own world, with its own deity, with its own form.\n\n12:8:2:1111\\. The milk of one (cow) he pours (into the Sura) the first night,\nthe milk of two the second\n\np. 242\n\nnight, and the milk of three the third night: he thus provides him with the\npressings, in accordance with their forms, and in accordance with their\ndeities.\n\n12:8:2:1212\\. With (Va _g_. S. XIX, 2), 'Hereof pour ye to the juice,' he\npours in (the milk) for the sake of (conformity with) the Soma-\npressing;--'(to) the Soma who is the supreme offering,'--for this, to wit,\nSoma, is indeed the supreme offering (-material): he thus makes it 1 to be the\nsupreme offering;--'the manly one who hath rushed into the waters,' for both\nwith water and between it is he (Soma) indeed pressed out;--'I have pressed\nout Soma by stones,' for by means of stones Soma is indeed pressed out: it is\nthus by means of stones he presses it out for the sake of (conformity with)\nthe Soma-pressing.\n\n12:8:2:1313\\. As to this they say, 'That Sautrama _n_ i, surely, is of the\nform of both effused (extracted) and infused 2 (Soma);--to wit, that essence\nof both water and plants, the milk, is of the form of the effused (Soma); and\nthat essence of food, the liquor, is of the form of infused (Soma): by both\n(kinds of) pressings he thus expresses it, by both pressings he secures it.\n\n12:8:2:1414\\. As to this they say, 'Seeing that the Soma-juice is pressed out\nby stones, how as to the Sautrama _n_ i?' Let him reply, 'By the directions 3\nand the\n\np. 243\n\n[paragraph continues] \xc3\x82pri-verses;' for the directions (praisha) are in the B\n_ri_ hati (metre), and the pressing-stones are of barhata nature: by means of\nstones the Soma-juice is indeed pressed out, and by means of stones he now\npresses it out for the sake of (conformity with) the Soma-pressing.\n\n12:8:2:1515\\. All (the praishas) contain (the word) 'payas' (milk), for in the\nform of milk Soma is (here) pressed 1; they all contain (the word) 'Soma,' for\nthe sake of (conformity with) the Soma-pressing; they all contain (the word)\n'parisrut' (spirituous liquor), for in the form of spirituous liquor Soma is\n(here) pressed; they all contain (the word) 'gh _ri_ ta' (ghee), for this--to\nwit, ghee--doubtless is manifestly a form of the sacrifice: he thus makes it\nto be manifestly a form of the sacrifice; they all contain (the word) 'madhu'\n(honey), for this--to wit, honey--is manifestly a form of Soma: he thus makes\nit to be manifestly a form of Soma.\n\n12:8:2:1616\\. They all refer to the A _s_ vins 2, for the sake of healing-\npower 3; they all refer to Sarasvati, for the obtainment of food; they all\nrefer to Indra, for the obtainment of energy, or vital power.\n\n12:8:2:1717\\. And, again, as to why they all refer to the A _s_ vins, all of\nthem to Sarasvati, and all of them to Indra,--these, indeed, were the deities\nwho first\n\np. 244\n\nprepared this sacrifice (the Sautrama _n_ i); with the help of these deities\nhe thus prepares it; and, besides, he also provides these deities with a\nshare.\n\n12:8:2:1818\\. The invitatory and offering formulas are made continuous 1, and\nrelate to the same deities,--for the sake of continuity and uninterruptedness\nof the race (offspring). All of them relate to the A _s_ vins, all of them to\nSarasvati, and all of them to Indra: the significance of this is the same as\nbefore.\n\n12:8:2:1919\\. The \xc3\x82pri-formulas 2 are anush _t_ ubh verses; for the Anush _t_\nubh is speech, and with speech Soma is pressed: he thus presses it with\nspeech, for the sake of (conformity with) the Soma-sacrifice. All of them\nrelate to the A _s_ vins, all of them to Sarasvati, and all of them to Indra:\nthe significance of this is the same as before.\n\n12:8:2:2020\\. The anupraishas 3 (after-directions) are in the\n\np. 245\n\n_g_ agata metre; for the _G_ agati is this (earth), and by means of her Soma\nis pressed: by means of her he thus presses it for the sake of (conformity\nwith) the Soma-pressing. All of them relate to the A _s_ vins, all of them to\nSarasvati, and all of them to Indra: the significance of this is the same as\nbefore.\n\n12:8:2:2121\\. This Sautrama _n_ i, then, is manifestly a Soma-sacrifice; and\nwere the Sacrificer alone to drink (the liquor), it would be either an ish _t_\ni-offering, or an animal sacrifice; but, for the sake of conformity of the\nliquor) to the Soma, all the priests drink thereof, for all the priests drink\nof the Soma-juice.\n\n12:8:2:2222\\. The Adhvaryus 1 drink (the contents of) the \xc3\x82 _s_ vina (cup),\nfor the A _s_ vins are the Adhvaryus of the gods: they thus consume each his\nown share in his own abode.\n\n12:8:2:2323\\. The Hot _ri_ , Brahman, and Maitravaru _n_ a (drink that) of the\nSarasvata (cup), for the Hot _ri_ is the voice of the sacrifice, the Brahman\nits heart, and the Maitravaru _n_ a its mind: they thus consume each his own\nshare in his own abode.\n\n12:8:2:2424\\. The Sacrificer drinks (that of) the Aindra (cup), for this\nsacrifice, the Sautrama _n_ i, belongs to Indra, and even now he who\nsacrifices has his abode along with Indra: he thus consumes his own share in\nhis own abode.\n\n12:8:2:2525\\. The \xc3\x82 _s_ vina cup, indeed, is the eye, the Sarasvata one the\nvital air, and the Aindra one\n\np. 246\n\nspeech. From the \xc3\x82 _s_ vina (cup) he pours (the remains) into the Sarasvata\none, whereby he combines his eye with the vital airs; from the Sarasvata cup)\ninto the Aindra one, whereby he combines his vital airs with his speech, and\nalso establishes his vital airs in (the channel of) speech, whence all the\nvital airs are established on speech.\n\n12:8:2:2626\\. Three (men) drink the \xc3\x82 _s_ vina (cup), to wit, the Adhvaryu,\nPratiprasthat _ri_ , and Agnidh; for this eye is threefold--the white, the\nblack, and the pupil: he thus bestows on him the eye in accordance with its\nform.\n\n12:8:2:2727\\. Three (drink) the Sarasvata (cup), the Hot _ri_ , Brahman, and\nMaitravaru _n_ a; for threefold divided is this vital air--the in (and\nout)-breathing, the up-breathing, and the through-breathing: he thus bestows\non him the vital air in accordance with its form.\n\n12:8:2:2828\\. Singly the Sacrificer drinks the Aindra (cup), for single is\nthat distinction of the vital airs, speech: singly and solely to himself does\nhe take that distinction, speech; whence he who has performed the Sautrama _n_\ni becomes singly and solely the most distinguished among his own people, and\nso does even he who knows this.\n\n12:8:2:2929\\. The officiating priests ( _ri_ tvi _g_ ), doubtless, are the\nseasons ( _ri_ tu), and the draughts (of liquor) are the months;--six priests\ndrink, for there are six seasons: by means of the priests he thus secures the\nseasons.\n\n12:8:2:3030\\. There are twelve draughts 1, and twelve\n\np. 247\n\nmonths: by means of the draughts he thus secures the months. The priests drink\nagain and again by turns, whence the seasons and months succeed one another by\nturns.\n\n12:8:2:3131\\. The thirteenth draught the Sacrificer takes, for, indeed, that\nthirteenth month is manifestly the year itself: it is this he secures by\nobtaining (that draught). And, indeed, the Sautrama _n_ i is the same as the\nyear, and by means of this he wins everything, and secures everything for\nhimself.\n\n12:8:2:3232\\. There are three victims, for three in number are these worlds:\nit is these worlds he thereby secures,--to wit, this (terrestrial) world by\nthat of the A _s_ vins, the air by that of Sarasvati, and the sky by that of\nIndra: he thus wins and secures these worlds for himself in accordance with\ntheir (peculiar) form and deity.\n\n12:8:2:3333\\. There are three sacrificial cakes, for there are three seasons:\nit is the seasons he thereby secures,--to wit, the summer by that of Indra,\nthe rainy season by that of Savit _ri_ , and the winter by that of Varu _n_ a:\nhe thus wins and secures the seasons for himself in accordance with their\n(peculiar) form and deity.\n\n12:8:2:3434\\. There are six cups (of milk and liquor), for there are six\nseasons: it is the seasons he thereby secures,--to wit, the spring and summer\nby the two \xc3\x82 _s_ vina (cups), the rainy season and autumn by the two Sarasvata\nones, and the winter and dewy season by the two Aindra ones: he thus wins and\nsecures the seasons for himself in accordance with their form and deity.\n\n12:8:2:3535\\. The invitatory and offering formulas are made continuous, and\nrelate to the same deities--\n\np. 248\n\nfor the sake of the continuity and uninterruptedness of the seasons. They are\nall of them invitatory-formulas and all offering-formulas 1, whence all the\nseasons pass onwards, and all of them return. All (the formulas) are first,\nall of them intermediate, and all of them last, whence all the seasons are\nfirst, all of them intermediate, and all of them last. All the cups have two\n(formulas, an) invitatory and (an) offering-formula,--this is of the form of\nday and night: it is the day and the night he thus secures for himself; whence\nboth the seasons and the months are established on day and night.\n\n12:8:2:3636\\. The Sautrama _n_ i, truly, is the same as the year, and the same\nas the moon; and the Sacrificer is manifestly the sun: his vedi (altar-ground)\nis this earth, his uttara-vedi the air, his barhis the sky, his officiating\npriests the quarters, his fuel the trees, his ghee the waters, his oblations\nthe plants, his fire Agni himself, his sa _m_ stha (the particular form of\nsacrifice) the year--and, indeed, everything here, whatever there is, is the\nyear; whence he who has performed the Sautrama _n_ i wins everything, and\nsecures everything for himself.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[239:2](sbe44069.htm#fr_611) Cf. II, 4, 4, 3-4, where the latter is called\nPratidar _s_ a _S_ vaikna (king of the _S_ vikna), whilst the former, after\nstudying with him, is said to have been called Sahadeva Sar _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ aya.\n\n[240:1](sbe44069.htm#fr_612) The 'Soma _m_ _s_ ava iva' would seem to have\nhere the force of 'Soma-shoots proper,' only substitutes (milk and liquor)\nbeing used instead.\n\n[240:2](sbe44069.htm#fr_613) That is to say, the observance of the fast--by\nwhich the Sacrificer during the four days of the performance of the Sautrama\n_n_ i, lives solely on the remains of the Agnihotra--takes the place of the\nordinary initiation of the Soma-sacrifice, there being no Diksha at the\nSautrama _n_ i.\n\n[240:3](sbe44069.htm#fr_614) The malted rice, malted barley, and fried rice,\nreferred to in p. 241 this and the next two paragraphs, refer to the remnants\nof these materials, not used at first in the preparation of the Sura, and\namounting to one-third of the original quantity of each; these being added\nsuccessively during the three nights during which the Sura has to mature; cf.\n[p. 223](sbe44067.htm#page_223), note [2](sbe44067.htm#fn_583).\n\n[241:1](sbe44069.htm#fr_615) Or, he renders him, the Sacrificer (or, perhaps,\nit, the sacrifice), successful by means of the morning-pressing.\n\n[241:2](sbe44069.htm#fr_616) The literal translation would seem to be,--he\nthus provides him with the respective (sva) world, with the respective deity,\nand with the respective form,--(hence) with the morning-pressing. It may be\nremarked, however, that the deities here connected with the three services\n(the A _s_ vins, Sarasvati, and Indra) are not those elsewhere associated with\nthem (Vasus, Rudras, and \xc3\x82dityas, IV, 3, 5, 1; or Agni, Indra, Vi _s_ ve Deva\n_h_ , XI, 5, 9, 7).\n\n[241:3](sbe44069.htm#fr_617) Viz. inasmuch as it is full of moisture (saras).\n\n[242:1](sbe44069.htm#fr_618) The 'enam' must refer to the Sura-liquor, treated\nas identical with Soma.\n\n[242:2](sbe44069.htm#fr_619) I do not quite understand the distinction between\nsuta' and 'asuta '; cf. XII, 8, 1, 6; unless the former be the pure Soma-\njuice, and the latter that mixed with other ingredients.\n\n[242:3](sbe44069.htm#fr_620) The 'praisha' are the directions by which the\nMaitravaru _n_ a calls on the Hot _ri_ to recite the offering-formulas (cf.\npart ii, p. 183, note 2). For the fore-offerings of the three victims, these\ndirections are given, Va _g_. S. XXI, 29-40. They all commence with 'Hota p.\n243 yakshat' (may the Hot _ri_ worship!), and end with 'paya _h_ soma _h_\nparisruta gh _ri_ ta _m_ madhu vyantv a _g_ yasya hotar ya _g_ a' (milk, Soma,\nwith parisrut-liquor, ghee, honey,--may they partake of the butter, Hot _ri_\nworship!).\n\n[243:1](sbe44069.htm#fr_621) ? Literally, 'by (way of) milk'--or, perhaps, 'by\nthe admixture of milk--Soma is (here, as it were) produced.'\n\n[243:2](sbe44069.htm#fr_622) In all the directions referred to, the three\ndeities are named.\n\n[243:3](sbe44069.htm#fr_623) The two A _s_ vins are the physicians of the\ngods. Cf. IV, 1, 5, 8 seqq.; [XII, 7, 2, 3](sbe44066.htm#12:7:2:3).\n\n[244:1](sbe44069.htm#fr_624) This refers to the puro\xe0\xa4\xbdnuvakyas and ya _g_ yas\nof the oblations of omentum (vapa) of the three victims. For these formulas\nthe three verses, Va _g_. S. XX, 67-69, are used in such a way that verse 1\nforms the anuvakya, and verse 2 the ya _g_ ya, of the A _s_ vins' oblation;\nverse 2 the anuvakya, and verse 3 the ya _g_ ya, of Sarasvati's oblation; and\nverse 3 the anuvakya, and verse 1 the ya _g_ ya, of Indra's oblation. In each\nof the three verses all the three deities are mentioned.--In exactly the same\nway the three verses, XX, 70-72, are used as the anuvakyas and ya _g_ yas of\nthe three pa _s_ upuro _d_ a _s_ as; and 73-75 as those of the chief oblations\n(havis) of meat-portions.\n\n[244:2](sbe44069.htm#fr_625) The \xc3\x82pris (propitiatory verses, cf. part ii, p.\n185) are the offering-formulas (ya _g_ ya) of the eleven (or twelve) fore-\nofferings (praya _g_ a) of the animal sacrifice. Those used on the present\noccasion are the twelve verses given, Va _g_. S. XX, 55-66; there being on\nthis occasion (in the second and third places) fore-offerings both to\nTanunapat and Nara _s_ a _m_ sa. In each of these verses, again, all three\ndeities are referred to.\n\n[244:3](sbe44069.htm#fr_626) I do not exactly know what formulas are thereby\nreferred to. p. 245 It can hardly be the praishas of the anuya _g_ as (Va _g_.\nS. XXI, 48-58), as these are not in the _g_ agati, but in the (arshi) trish\n_t_ ubh metre; though certainly each of them contains the names of the three\ndeities.\n\n[245:1](sbe44069.htm#fr_627) Viz. the Adhvaryu, and his two assistants, the\nPratiprasthat _ri_ and Agnidh. Cf. [XII, 8, 1, 3](sbe44068.htm#12:8:1:3) seqq.\n\n[246:1](sbe44069.htm#fr_628) Viz. inasmuch as three priests partake of each of\nthe first two cups of milk, and of the first two cups of Surd-liquor, and each\npriest drinks twice.\n\n[248:1](sbe44069.htm#fr_629) See p. 244, note , where it is shown that each of\nthe three verses serves successively as puro\xe0\xa4\xbdnuvakya and as ya _g_ ya.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XII, 8, 3.
