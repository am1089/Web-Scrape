Pillows for the cheek, and the head of the bed exhaled perfumes.\nVessels filled with camphor, rosewater, sandal and other perfumes were\narranged on all sides of the bed. Pictures of all kinds were drawn on the\nwalls; flowers, fruits, sweetmeats and confectionary were placed here and\nthere in the recesses: and every thing, that could contribute to pleasure, was\nprovided. Wearing a petticoat, and full loose robe of great splendour, on\nwhich were sewn real pearls; and a shining boddice, glittering cloth for the\nbody, and a brilliant cloak, ornamented from head to foot; with red horizontal\nlines drawn across the forehead, a ring for the nose of large pearls,\nornaments for the head, ear-rings, lines on the top of the head, where the\nhair is parted, marks between the eyebrows, ornaments for the ears, and\nforehead, a necklace composed of circular pieces of gold, a string of gold\nbeads and coral, an ornament for the breast and decked out with numerous other\njewels and ornaments,--bright as the moon,--of the colour of chumpa, with eyes\nlike those of a deer, a voice like the kokila\'s (the Indian cuckoo) the gait\nof an elephant and\n\np. 282\n\nwaist of a lion, Shree Rookmunee Jee was reclining; and also Shree Krishnu\nChund, the root of joy, of the colour of the clouds, a countenance like the\nmoon, lotus eyes, wearing a peacock crown, a garland of various flowers\nreaching to the feet, dressed in yellow silk, with a scarf of the same colour,\nthe sea of beauty, the light of the three worlds. They were enjoying the\npleasures of mutual love, when suddenly Shree Krishnu said to Rookmunee, "O\nbeautiful Rookmunee! I wish to say something to you, to which you must give me\nan answer; you are possessed of great beauty, and many excellent qualities of\nmind, and the daughter of Raja Bheekmuk; why did you reject Raja Sissoopal of\nChunderee who was very mighty and renowned; in whose family kingly power has\ndescended for seven generations, and from dread of whom I fled, and abandoning\nMuttra took up my abode in the sea, and to whom your mother, father and\nbrother wished you to be married, and he himself came with a marriage\nprocession; and having refused to marry him sent for me through a brahmin,\nthereby sacrificing all respect for the honour of your family, disregarding\nthe opinion of the world and laying aside all fear of your parents and your\nbrother? I am not worthy of you, nor equal to you in accomplishments, I am not\na Raja, nor have I beauty, or mental superiority. Some beggars talked of my\nrenown, whose praises of me you heard, and treasured up in your mind. A Raja\ncame to marry you, accompanied by his army; you then sent an invitation to me.\nOn my arrival, there was a fierce battle: and how was my honour saved? I took\nyou away in sight of them all; and Bulram dispersed all their army. You wrote\nto me, requesting that I would deliver you out of the hands of Sissoopal;\nwhich wish of yours has been accomplished; and I have no desire, believe me, O\nlovely Rookmunee, you have not hitherto suffered any loss or injury; go and\nlive with some powerful Raja, of high family, and excellent qualities of mind,\nwho may be worthy of you."\n\np. 283\n\nO great king! on hearing these words, Shree Rookmunee Jee was in a state of\nconsternation, and fell staggering and reeling upon the earth; and struggling\nlike a fish deprived of water, became senseless and heaved deep, long-drawn\nsighs, then her curls fell in the greatest disorder over her beautiful face,\nand became entangled with each other; like the moon wandering from her path,\nas a snake that has imbibed the water of immortality. On observing her\ncondition, Shree Krishnu Chund rose up in a state of great agitation and\nalarm, thinking that she was about to die; and assuming a form with four arms,\nwent up to her, and raising her from the ground with two hands placed her on\nhis bosom; and began to fan her with the third hand, and arrange her hair with\nthe fourth.\n\nO great king! Nundlall (Krishnu) exerted himself greatly in consequence of his\naffection. He sometimes wiped his beloved\'s face with a silken cloth, and\nsometimes placed his soft, lotus-like hand on her breast: at length Shree\nRookmunee revived. Huri then said, "Thou hast a very deep love for me, O\nbeloved Rookmunee! and didst not retain a particle of firmness in thy mind.\nYou thought that I really meant to abandon you; when I was only jesting and\ntrifling with your affection. Be now of good cheer; and, recovering your\nspirits and animation, open your eyes." On seeing that Krishnu had taken her\nin his lap, she blushed, and was very much ashamed. She rose and stood up in\ngreat confusion; and, joining her hands, fell at his feet. Krishnu said,\npatting her on the back, "Beautiful creature! who becamest insensible from\nlove, what I said in jest, you thought serious. It is not right to be angry,\nat what is said in joke; rise and banish all anger and affliction."\n\nO great king! Shree Rookmunee Jee rose on hearing these words; and, joining\nher hands and bending her head, began to say to Krishnu, "You have spoken\ntruly in saying that you are not worthy of me, because you are the husband of\nLuchmee, and the lord of Shivu and Bruhmu,\n\np. 284\n\nwho is equal to you in the three worlds? O lord of the world! whoever abandons\nyou, and goes to (worships) any other, is like a man, who should give up\nsinging the praises of Huri, and sing the praises of a vulture. And, O great\nking! with respect to what you said regarding some mighty and potent Raja, say\nwhere in the three worlds shall I find a Raja more powerful and greater than\nyou? Bruhmu, Roodru, Indru and all the gods who bestow boons, are obedient to\nyour commands. Through your favour, they make whomsoever they please great and\npowerful, renowned, celebrated and glorious, by conferring boons. And\nwhatsoever persons perform a very difficult penance in honour of you, for a\nhundred years, attain to the dignity of Raja .And whoever forgetting and\nabandoning your worship, [meditation](errata.htm#15), prayers, penance and\nguidance, do wicked acts, are of themselves utterly ruined and disgraced. O\nlord of compassion! it is your constant custom to descend in various forms and\nfrequently upon the earth for the sake of your worshippers; and, having\ndestroyed wicked demons, and removed the burthens of the world, you confer\nhappiness on your own, and grant all their supplications. And, O lord! on\nwhomsoever your great compassion is shed, and he thereby obtains wealth, royal\npower, youth, beauty and eminence; and subsequently being blinded by pride,\nforgets religion, penance, truth, mercy, worship and adoration, you reduce him\nto poverty; because the poor constantly meditate upon you, and keep you in\nremembrance, for this reason the poor man is acceptable to you. He, to whom\nyour great mercy is shown, will always be without riches."\n\nO great king! Rookmunee proceeded to say, "O lord of life, I will not do as\nUnba, the daughter of Indrudown, Raja of Benares, did, abandoning her husband,\nand going to the Raja Bheekmuk; and when he would not receive her, she\nreturned to her own husband, who, after this, turned her out of doors; then\nhaving gone, and sat on the bank of the Ganges, she\n\np. 285\n\nperformed a great penance in honour of Muhadeo, who came there, and granted\nthe boon she solicited. By means of that boon, she took her revenge upon Raja\nBheekmuk. I certainly will not imitate such conduct. You have explained, O\nlord! that some beggars came, and extolled your greatness; and that I believed\nwhat they said, and sent a brahmin to you: the beggars who came, where Shivu,\nBruhmu and Doorga. Narud, the sage, constantly praises your excellent\nqualities. Knowing you to be compassionate, I sent a brahmin; you came and\nbrought destruction upon wicked men. Knowing her humility, you brought me,\nyour servant, with you, and have raised me, lord! to greatness." Krishnu said\nin reply, "O beloved! you have had experience of my mind, thoughts and nature.\nYou have attended upon me, and worshipped me, and known my love; for this\nreason the affections of my mind are fixed upon you."\n\nO great king! Rookmunee was gratified by this speech of Huri\'s, and attended\nupon him.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LXII](psa63.htm)\n\n'
