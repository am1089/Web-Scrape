You have taken on your head\nthe burden heavy with stones, and who is to lighten it for you? p. 117  \nYour Friend stands on the other shore, but you never think in your mind how\nyou may meet with Him:  \nThe boat is broken, and yet you sit ever upon the bank; and thus you are\nbeaten to no purpose by the waves.  \nThe servant Kabir asks you to consider; who is there that shall befriend you\nat the last?  \nYou are alone, you have no companion: you will suffer the consequences of your\nown deeds.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: LXXV](sok076.htm)\n\n'
