Then Kahola Kaushitakeya asked. 'Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, 'he said, 'tell me\nthe Brahman which is visible, not invisible, the Self (\xc3\x82tman), who is within\nall.'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya replied: 'This, thy Self, who is within all.'\n\n'Which Self, O Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, is within all?'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya replied: 'He who overcomes hunger and thirst, sorrow,\npassion, old age, and death. When Brahma _n_ as know that Self, and have risen\nabove the desire for sons 2, wealth, and (new) worlds 3, they wander about as\nmendicants. For a desire for sons is desire for wealth, a desire for wealth is\ndesire for worlds. Both these are indeed desires. Therefore let a Brahma _n_\na, after he has done with learning,\n\np. 130\n\nwish to stand by real strength 1; after he has done with that strength and\nlearning, he becomes a Muni (a Yogin); and after he has done with what is not\nthe knowledge of a Muni, and with what is the knowledge of a Muni, he is a\nBrahma _n_ a. By whatever means he has become a Brahma _n_ a, he is such\nindeed 2. Everything else is of evil.' After that Kahola Kaushitakeya held his\npeace.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[129:1](sbe15068.htm#fr_403) Madhyandina text, p. 1071, standing before the\nfourth Brahma _n_ a.\n\n[129:2](sbe15068.htm#fr_404) See B _ri_ h. \xc3\x82r. Up. IV, 4, 22.\n\n[129:3](sbe15068.htm#fr_405) Life in the world of the Fathers, or in the world\nof the Gods.\n\n[130:1](sbe15068.htm#fr_406) Knowledge of the Self, which enables us to\ndispense with all other knowledge.\n\n[130:2](sbe15068.htm#fr_407) Mr. Gough proposes as an alternative rendering:\n'Let a Brahma _n_ a renounce learning and become as a child; and after\nrenouncing learning and a childlike mind, let him become a quietist; and when\nhe has made an end of quietism and non-quietism, he shall become a Brahma _n_\na, a Brahma _n_ a indeed.' Deussen takes a similar view, but I doubt whether\n'the knowledge of babes' is not a Christian rather than an Indian idea, in\nspite of _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara's remarks on Ved. Sutra, III, 4, 50, which are strangely\nat variance with his commentary here. Possibly the text may be corrupt, for\ntish _th_ aset too is a very peculiar form. We might conjecture balyena, as we\nhave abalyam, in IV, 4, 1. In Kaush. Up. III, 3, abalyam stands for ab\xc4\x83lyam,\npossibly for \xc4\x83b\xc4\x83lyam. The construction of kena syad yena syat tened _ri_ _s_ a\neva, however, is well known.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 6](sbe15069.htm)\n\n"
