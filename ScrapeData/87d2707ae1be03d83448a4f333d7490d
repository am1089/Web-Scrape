So I am in constant terror of my life; yet I do not like\nto ask him not to do it, because it gives him so much pleasure; but if he left\noff of his own accord I should be very glad.\'--\' What does be say to you\nhimself about it?\' asked the brother. \'Every day,\' she replied, \'when he has\nshot the pearl, he comes to me quite happy and proud, and says, "Was there\never a man as clever as I am?" and I answer him, "No, I do not think there\never was any as clever as you." \'--\' Do not say so again,\' said the brother,\n\'but next time he asks you the question, answer, "Yes, there are many men in\nthe world more clever than you." The Pearlshooter\'s wife promised to take her\nbrother\'s advice. So next time her husband shot the pearl from her nose-ring,\nand said to her, \'Was there ever a man as clever as I am?\' she answered, \'Yes,\nthere are many men in the world more clever than you.\' Then he said, \'If so be\nthat there are, I will not rest until I have found them.\'\n\nAnd he left her, and went a far journey into the jungle, in order to find, if\npossible, a cleverer man than himself.\n\nOn, on, on he journeyed a very long way, until at last he came to a large\nriver, and on the river-bank sat a traveller eating his dinner. The\nPearlshooter sat down beside him, and the two began conversing together. At\nlast the Pearlshooter said to his friend, \'What is the reason of your journey,\nand where are you going?\' The stranger answered, \'I am a Wrestler, and the\nstrongest man in all this country; I can do many wonderful things in the way\nof wrestling and carrying heavy weights, and I began to think that in all this\nworld there was no one so clever as I; but I have lately heard of a still more\nwonderful man who lives in a distant country, and who is so clever that every\nmorning he shoots one of the pearls from his wife\'s nose-ring without hurting\nher. So I go to find him, and learn if this is true.\' The Pearl-shooter\nanswered, \'Then you need travel no further, for I am that man of whom you\nheard.\'--\' Why are you travelling about, and where are you going?\' asked the\nWrestler. \'I,\' replied the other, \'am also travelling to see if in all the\nworld I can find a cleverer man than myself; therefore, as we have both the\nsame object in view, let us be as brothers, and go about together; perhaps\nthere is still in the world a better man than we.\'\n\nThe Wrestler agreed; so they both started on their way together.\n\nThey had not gone very far before they came to a place where three roads met,\nand there sat another man whom neither of them had ever seen before. He\naccosted the Wrestler and the Pearlshooter, and said to them, \'Who are you,\nfriends, and where are you going?\'--\'We,\' answered they, \'are two clever men,\nwho are travelling through the world to see if we can find a cleverer man than\nwe; but who may you be, and where are you going? \'--\'I,\' replied the third\nman, \'am a Pundit  2 a man of memory, renowned for my good head, a great\nthinker; and verily I thought there was not in the world a more wonderftil man\nthan I; but having heard of two men in distant lands of very great cleverness,\nthe one of whom is a Wrestler, and the other a shooter of Pearls from his\nwife\'s nose-ring, I go to find them and learn if the things I heard are\ntrue.\'--\' They are true,\' said the other; \'for we, O Pundit, are the very two\nmen of whom you speak.\'\n\nAt this news the Pundit was overjoyed, and cried, \'Then let us be as brothers;\nsince your homes are far distant, return with me to my house, which is close\nby; there you can rest a while, and each of us put our various powers to the\nproof.\' This proposal pleased the Wrestler and the Pearlshooter, who\naccompanied the Pundit to his house.\n\nNow, in the Pundit\'s kitchen there was an enormous caldron of iron, so heavy\nthat five-and-twenty men could hardly move it; and in the dead of night, the\nWrestler, to prove his power, got up from the verandah where he was sleeping,\nand as quietly as possible lifted this great caldron on to his shoulders, and\ncarried it down to the river, where he waded with it into the deepest part of\nthe water, and there buried it. After having accomplished this feat, he\nreturned to the Pundit\'s house as quietly as he had left it, and, rolling\nhimself up in his blanket fell fast asleep. But though he had come never so\nsoftly, the Pundit\'s wife heard him, and waking her husband, she said, \'I hear\nfootsteps as of people creeping quietly about and not wishing to be heard, and\nbut a little while ago I noticed the same thing; perhaps there are thieves in\nthe house, let us go and see; it is strange they should choose such a bright\nmoonlight night.\' And they both got up quickly, and walked round the house.\nThey found nothing, however, out of order, nor any signs of anything having\nbeen touched or disarranged, until they came to the kitchen. And, indeed, at\nfirst they thought all was as they left it there, when, just as they were\ngoing away, the Pundit\'s wife cried out to him, \'Why, what has become of the\ngreat caldron I I never thought of looking to see if that were safe; for it\ndid not seem possible that it could have been moved.\' And they both looked\ninside the house and outside, but the caldron was nowhere to be seen. At last,\nhowever, they discovered deep footprints in the sand close to the kitchen-\ndoor, as of some one who had been carrying a very heavy weight, and these they\ntraced down to the river-side.\n\nThen the Pundit said, \'Some one immensely strong has evidently done this, for\nhere are the footprints of one man only; and he must have buried the caldron\nin the water, for see, there is no continuation of footprints on the other\nside. I wonder who can have done it. Let us go and see that our two guests are\nasleep; perhaps the Wrestler played us this trick to prove his great\nstrength.\' And, with his wife, he went into the verandah where the\nPearlshooter and the Wrestler lay rolled up in their blankets, fast asleep.\nFirst they looked at the Pearlshooter; but, on seeing him, the Pundit shook\nhis head, saying, \'No, he certainly has not done this thing.\' They then looked\nat the Wrestler, and the cunning Pundit licked the skin of the sleeping man,\nand, turning to his wife, whispered, \'This assuredly is the man who stole the\ncaldron and put it in the river, for he must have been but lately up to his\nneck in fresh water, since there \'s no taste of salt on his skin from his foot\neven to his shoulders. To-morrow I will surprise him by showing him I know\nthis.\' And so saying, the Pundit crept back into the house followed by his\nwife.\n\nNext morning early, as soon as it was light, the Pearlshooter and the Wrestler\nwere accosted by their host, who said to them, \'Let us come down to the river\nand have a bathe, for I cannot offer you a bath, since the great caldron, in\nwhich we generally wash, has been mysteriously carried away this very\nnight.\'--\'Where can it have gone?\' said the Wrestler. \'Ah! where indeed?\'\nanswered the Pundit, and he led them down to where the caldron had been put\ninto the river by the Wrestler the night before, and, wading about in the\nwater until he found it, pointed it out to him, saying, \'See, friend, how far\nthis caldron travelled!\' The Wrestler was much surprised to find that the\nPundit knew where the caldron was hidden, and said, \'Who can have put it\nthere? \'--\'I will tell you,\' answered the Pundit, \'why I think it was you!\'\nAnd then he related how his wife had heard footsteps, and being afraid of\nthieves, had awakened him the night before, and how they had discovered that\nthe caldron was missing, and traced it down to the river-side; and then how he\nhad found out that the Wrestler had just before been into the water up to his\nneck. The Wrestler and the Pearlshooter were both much astonished at the\nPundit\'s wisdom in having found this out; and the Pearlshooter said to\nhimself, \'Both these men are certainly more clever than!.\' Then the three\nclever men returned to the house, and were very happy and joyful, and amused\nthemselves laughing and talking all the rest of the day; and when evening\ncame, the Pundit said to the Wrestler, \'Let us to-night forego all meagre\nfare, and have a royal feast; friend Strongman, pray you go and catch the\nfattest of those goats that we see upon the hills yonder, and we will cook it\nfor our dinner.\' The Wrestler assented, and ran on and on, until he reached\nthe flock of goats which were browsing upon the hillside. Now, just at that\nmoment a wicked little Demon came by that way, and on seeing the Wrestler\nlooking at the goats (to see which seemed the finest to take home to dinner),\nhe thought to himself, \'If I can make him choose me, and take me home with him\nfor his dinner, I shall be able to play him and his friends some fine tricks.\'\nSo, quick as thought, he changed himself into a very handsome goat, and when\nthe Wrestler saw this one goat so much taller, and finer, and fatter than all\nthe rest, he ran and caught hold of him, and tucked him under his arm, to\ncarry him home for dinner. The goat kicked and kicked, and jumped about, and\ntried to butt more fiercely than the Wrestler had ever known any mortal goat\ndo before, but still he held him tight, and brought him in triumph to the\nPundit\'s door. The Pundit heard him coming, and ran out to meet him; but when\nhe saw the goat, he started back terrified, for the Wrestler was holding it so\ntight that its eyes were almost starting out of its head, and they were fiery\nand evil-looking, and burning like two living coals, insomuch that the Pundit\nsaw at once that it was a Demon, and no goat that his friend held. Then he\nthought quickly, \'If I appear to be frightened this cruel Demon will get into\nthe house and devour us all; I must endeavour to intimidate him.\' So, in a\nbold voice, he cried, \'O Wrestler! Wrestler! foolish friend! what have you\ndone? We asked you to fetch a fat goat for our dinner, and here you have only\nbrought one wretched little Demon. If you could not find goats, while you were\nabout it you might as well have brought more Demons, for we are hungry people.\nMy children are each accustomed to eat one Demon a day, and my wife eats\nthree, and I myself eat twelve, and here you have only brought one between us\nall! What are we to do?\' At hearing these reproaches the Wrestler was so much\nastonished that he dropped the Demon goat, who, for his part, was so\nfrightened at the Pundit\'s words, that he came crawling along quite humbly\nupon his knees, saying, \'0 sir! do not eat me, do not eat me, and I will give\nyou anything you like in the world. Only let me go, and I will fetch you\nmountains of treasure, rubies and diamonds and gold and precious stones beyond\nall count. Do not eat me; only let me go! \'--\' No, no,\' said the Pundit; \'I\nknow what you\'ll do; you \'ll just go away and never return; we are very\nhungry; we do not want gold and precious stones, but we want a good dinner; we\nmust certainly eat you.\' The Demon thought all that the Pundit said must be\ntrue, he spoke so fearlessly and naturally. So he only repeated more\nearnestly, \'Only let me go; I promise you to return and bring you all the\nriches that you could desire.\' The Pundit was too wise to seem glad; but he\nsaid sternly, \'Very well, you may go; but unless you return quickly, and bring\nthe treasure you promise, be you in the uttermost part of the earth, we will\nfind you and eat you, for we are more powerful than you and all your fellows.\'\n\nThe Demon, who had just experienced how much stronger the Wrestler was than\nordinary men, and then heard from the Pundit\'s own lips of his love for eating\nDemons, thought himself exceedingly lucky to have escaped their clutches so\neasily; and, returning to his own land, he fetched from the Demon\'s storehouse\na vast amount of precious things with which he was flying away with all speed\n(in order to pay his debt and avoid being afterwards hunted and eaten), when\nseveral of his comrades caught hold of him, and in angry tones asked whither\nhe was carrying so much of their treasure. The Demon answered, \'I take it to\nsave my life; for whilst wandering round the world I was caught by terrible\ncreatures, more dreadful than the sons of men, and they threaten to eat me\nunless I bring the treasure.\'\n\n\'We should like to see these dreadful creatures,\' answered they, \'for we never\nbefore heard of mortals who devoured Demons.\' To which he replied, \'These are\nnot ordinary mortals; I tell you they are the fiercest creatures I ever saw,\nand would devour our Rajah himself, if they got the chance; one of them said\nthat he daily ate twelve Demons, that his wife ate three, and each of his\nchildren one.\' At hearing this they consented to let him go for the time; but\nthe Demon Rajah commanded him to return with all speed next day, that the\nmatter might be further discussed in solemn council.\n\nWhen, after three days\' absence, the Demon returned to the Pundit\'s house with\nthe treasure, the Pundit said to him angrily, \'Why have you been so long away?\nYou promised to return as soon as possible.\' He answered, \'All my fellow-\nDemons detained me, and would hardly let me go, they were so vexed at my\nbringing you so much treasure; and though I told them how great and powerful\nyou are, they would not believe me, but will, as soon as I return, judge me in\nsolemn council for serving you.\'--\'Where is your solemn council held?\' asked\nthe Pundit. \'Oh, very far, far away,\' answered the Demon, \'in the depths of\nthe jungle, where our Rajah daily holds his court.\'--\' I and my friends should\nlike to see the place, and your Rajah, and all his court,\' said the Pundit;\n\'you must take us with you when you go, for we have absolute mastery over all\nDemons, even over their Rajah himself, and unless you do as we command, we\nshall be very angry.\'--\'Very well,\' answered the Demon--for he felt quite\nfrightened at the Pundit\'s fierce words; \'mount on my back, and I\'ll take you\nthere.\' So the Pundit, the Wrestler, and the Pearlshooter all mounted the\nDemon, and he flew away with them, on, on, on, as fast as wings could cut the\nair, till they reached the great jungle where the durbar  3 was to be held,\nand there he placed them all on the top of a high tree just over the Demon\nRajah\'s throne. In a few minutes the Pearlshooter, the Wrestler, and the\nPundit heard a rushing noise, and thousands and thousands of Demons filled the\nplace, covering the ground as far as the eye could reach, and thronging\nchiefly round the Rajah\'s throne; but they did not notice the men up in the\ntree above them. Then the Rajah ordered that the evil spirit, who had taken of\ntheir treasure to give to mortals, should be brought to judgment; and when\nthey had dragged the culprit into the midst of them, they accused him, and\nhaving proved him guilty, would have punished him, but he defended himself\nstoutly, saying, \'Noble Rajah, those who forced me to fetch them treasure were\nno ordinary mortals, but great and terrible; they said they ate many Demons;\nthe man eats twelve a day, his wife eats three, and each of his children one.\nHe said, moreover, that he and his friends were more powerful than us all, and\nruled your majesty as absolutely as we are ruled by you.\' The Demon Rajah\nanswered, \'Let us see these great people of whom you speak, and we will\nbelieve you; but--.\' At this moment the tree upon which the Pundit, the\nPearlshooter, and the Wrestler were broke, and down they all tumbled; first\nthe Wrestler, then the Pearlshooter, and lastly the Pundit, upon the head of\nthe Demon Rajah as he sat in judgment. They seemed to have come down from the\nsky, so suddenly did they appear, and, being very much alarmed at their\nawkward position, determined to take the aggressive. So the Wrestler kicked\nand hugged and beat the Rajah with all his might and main, and the\nPearlshooter did likewise, while the Pundit, who was perched up a little\nhigher than either of the others, cried, \'So be it! so be it! We will eat him\nfirst for dinner, and afterwards we will eat all the other Demons.\' The evil\nspirits hearing this, one and all flew away from the confusion, and left their\nRajah to his fate; while he cried, \'Oh, spare me! spare me! I see it is all\ntrue; only let me go, and I will give you as much treasure as you like.\'--\'No,\nno,\' said the Pundit; \'don\'t listen to him, friends; we will eat him for\ndinner.\' And the Wrestler and the Pearlshooter kicked and beat him harder than\nbefore. Then the Demon cried again, \'Let me go! let me go!\'--\' No, no,\' they\nanswered; and they chastised him vigorously for the space of an hour, until,\nat last, fearing they might get tired, the Pundit said, \'The treasure would be\nno use to us here in the jungle, but if you brought us a very great deal to\nour own house, we might give up eating you for dinner to-day; you must,\nhowever, give us great compensation, for we are all very hungry.\' To this the\nDemon Rajah gladly agreed, and calling together his scattered subjects,\nordered them to take the three valiant men home again, and convey the treasure\nto the Pundit\'s house. The little Demons obeyed his orders with much fear and\ntrembling, but they were eager to do their best to get the Pundit, the\nPearlshooter, and the Wrestler out of Demon-land, who for their parts were no\nless anxious to go. When they got home, the Pundit said, \'You shall not leave\nuntil the engagement is fulfilled.\'\n\nInstantly Demons without number filled the house with riches; and when they\nhad accomplished their task, they all flew away, greatly fearing the terrible\nPundit and his friends, who talked of eating Demons as men would eat almonds\nand raisins. So, by never showing that he was afraid, this brave Pundit saved\nhis family from being eaten by these evil spirits, and also got a vast amount\nof treasure. He divided the spoil into three equal portions: a third he gave\nto the Wrestler, a third to the Pearl-shooter, and a third he kept himself;\nafter which he sent his friends with many kindly words back to their own\nhomes. So the Pearlshooter returned to his house laden with gold and jewels of\npriceless worth; and when he got there, he called his wife and gave them to\nher, saying, \'I have been a far journey, and brought back all these treasures\nfor you, and I have learnt that your words were true, since in the world there\nare cleverer men than I; for mine is a cleverness that profits not, and but\nfor a Pundit and a Wrestler, I should not have gained these riches. I will\nshoot the pearl from your nose-ring no more.\' And he never did.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1](odd27.htm#fr_94) See Notes.\n\n[2](odd27.htm#fr_95) Wise man.\n\n[3](odd27.htm#fr_96) Council.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XXIV.
