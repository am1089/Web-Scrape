(The pra _n_ as are) seven, on account of this being understood (from\nscriptural passages) and of the specification (of those seven).\n\nSo far we have shown that there is in reality no conflict of scriptural\npassages regarding the origin of the pra _n_ as. It will now be shown that\nthere is also no conflict regarding their number. The chief vital air (mukhya\npra _n_ a) will be discussed later on. For the present the Sutrakara the\nnumber of the other pra _n_ as. A doubt arises here owing to the conflicting\nnature of the scriptural passages. In one place seven pra _n_ as are\nmentioned, 'The seven pra _n_ as spring from him' (Mu. Up. II, 1, 8). In\nanother place eight pra _n_ as are mentioned as being grahas, 'Eight grahas\nthere are and eight atigrahas' (B _ri_. Up. III, 2, 1). In another place nine,\n'Seven are the pra _n_ as of the head, two the lower ones' (Taitt. Sa _m_ h.\nV, 3, 2, 5). Sometimes ten, 'Nine pra _n_ as indeed are in men, the navel is\nthe tenth' (Taitt. Sa _m_ h. V, 3, 2, 3). Sometimes eleven, 'Ten are these pra\n_n_ as in man, and \xc3\x82tman is the eleventh' (B _ri_. Up. III, 9, 4). Sometimes\ntwelve, 'All touches have their centre in the skin,' &c. (B _ri_. Up. II, 4,\n11). Sometimes thirteen, 'The eye and what can be seen,' &c. (Pr. Up. IV, 8).\n--Thus the scriptural passages disagree about the number of the pra _n_ as.\n\np. 80\n\nHere the purvapakshintains that the pra _n_ as are in reality seven in number,\non account of understanding, i.e. because they are understood to be so many,\nfrom passages such as 'The seven pra _n_ as spring from him,' &c. These seven\npra _n_ as are moreover specified in the other passage quoted above, 'Seven\nindeed are the pra _n_ as of the head.'--But in the same passage we meet with\nthe following reiteration, 'Resting in the cave they are placed there seven\nand seven,' which intimates that there are pra _n_ as in addition to the\nseven.--No matter, we reply; that reiteration is made with reference to the\nplurality of men, and means that each man has seven pra _n_ as; it does not\nmean that there are two sets of seven pra _n_ as each of different nature.--\nBut, another objection will be raised, other scriptural passages speak of the\npra _n_ as as eight in number; how then should they be seven?--True, we reply,\nthe number of eight also is stated; but on account of the contradictory nature\nof the statements we have to decide in favour of either of the two numbers;\nhence we decide in favour of the number seven, in deference to the (simpler)\nassumption of a low number, and consider the statements of other numbers to\nrefer to the difference of modifications (of the fundamental seven pra _n_\nas).--To this argumentation the next Sutra replies:\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 4, 6](sbe38060.htm)\n\n"
