If a father makes a partition with his sons, he may dispose of his self-\nacquired property as he thinks best.\n\n[XVII. I. Y. II, 114.--2. Y. II, 121.--3. M. IX, 216; Y.

But in regard to wealth \'inherited of the paternal grandfather, the\nownership of father and son is equal.\n\n3\\. (Sons), who have separated from their father, should give a share to (a\nbrother) who is born after partition.\n\n4\\. The wealth of a man who dies without male issue goes to his wife;\n\n5\\. On failure of her, to his daughter;\n\n6\\. On failure of her, to his father;\n\n7\\. On failure of him, to his mother;\n\n8\\. On failure of her, to his brother;\n\n9\\. On failure of him, to his brother\'s son;\n\n10\\. On failure of him, to the relations called Bandhu;\n\n11\\. On failure of them, to the relations called Sakulya;\n\n12\\. On failure of them, to a fellow-student;\n\n13\\. On failure of him, it goes to the king, with the exception of a Brahma\n_n_ a\'s property.\n\n14\\. The property of a Brahma _n_ a goes to (other) Brahma _n_ as.\n\n[8. \'On failure of brothers the sister inherits.\' (Nand.)\n\n9\\. \'On failure of a brother\'s son the, sister\'s son inherits.\' (Nand.)\n\n10\\. Bandhu means Sapi _nd_ a (allied by funeral oblations). The inheritance\ngoes first: to the Sapi _nd_ as on the father\'s side in thc following order:\n(the brother\'s son), the brother\'s grandson, the grandfather, his son,\ngrandson, and great-grandson, the great-grandfather, his son, grandson, and\ngreat-grandson. Then follow the mother\'s Sapi _nd_ as in the same order.\n(Nand.)\n\n11\\. Sakulya means distant kinsmen, beginning with the fifth in descent and\nascent. On failure of such, the inheritance goes to the spiritual teacher; on\nfailure of him, to a pupil of the deceased, as ordained by \xc3\x82pastamba (II, 6,\n14, 3); and on failure of him, to a fellow-student, as stated in Sutra 12.\n(Nand.)]\n\np. 69\n\n15\\. The wealth of a (deceased) hermit shall be taken by his spiritual\nteacher;\n\n16\\. Or his pupil (may take it).\n\n17\\. But let a reunited coparcener take the share of his reunited coparcener\nwho has died (without issue), and a uterine brother that of his uterine\nbrother, and let them give (the shares of their deceased coparceners and\nuterine brothers) to the sons of the latter.\n\n18\\. What has been given to a woman by her father, mother, sons, or brothers,\nwhat she has received before the sacrificial fire (at the marriage ceremony),\nwhat she receives on supersession, what has been given to her by her\nrelatives, her fee ( _S_ ulka), and a gift subsequent, are called \'woman\'s\nproperty\' (Stridhana).\n\n19\\. If a woman married according to (one of the first) four rites, beginning\nwith the Brahma rite, dies without issue, that (Stridhana) belongs to her\nhusband.\n\n20\\. (If she has been married) according to (one of) the other (four\nreprehensible rites), her father shall take it.\n\n[18. \' _S_ ulka, "fee," denotes the price or value of a house or other\nvaluable object presented to the bride by her father; or it means the fee paid\nfor her by the bridegroom.\' (Nand.) The latter interpretation is evidently the\ncorrect one. The bride\'s \'fee\' (see Gaut. XXVIII, 25), from being originally\nthe price due to the parents or guardian of the bride for surrendering her to\nthe bridegroom, became in after times a wedding present, which the bride\nreceived from the bridegroom either directly or through her parents. This is\nthe only way to account for the Sulka being enumerated among the constituent\nparts of Stridhana in this place. See also I. D. Mayne, Hindu Law and Usage,\n\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 77, 566; Mayr, Indisches Erbrecht, 170 seq.; Jolly, Stellung der Frauen,\n23, note\n\n19, 20, See XXIV, 17-27.]\n\np. 70\n\n21\\. If she dies leaving children, her wealth goes in every case to her\ndaughter.\n\n22\\. Ornaments worn by women when their husbands were alive, the heirs shall\nnot divide among themselves; if they divide them, they become outcasts.\n\n23\\. (Coparceners) descended from different fathers must adjust their shares\naccording to the fathers. Let each take the wealth due to his father, no other\n(has a right to it).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XVIII.](sbe07020.htm)\n\n'
