Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus granting the boon to the Goddess Lak _s_ mi,\nS\xc2\x92ambhu quickly returned to the lovely Kailas\xc2\x92a, adorned with Apsaras\n(celestial nymphs) and frequented and served by the Gods. He then despatched\nhis expert attendant Chitrarupa to Vaiku _nt_ ha to bring the purpose of Lak\n_s_ mi to a successful issue. He said to him thus :-- \xc2\x93O Chitrarupa! Go to\nHari and speak to him on my behalf that\n\n\n\np. 550\n\n\n\nHe would go and remove the sorrows of His distressed and bereaved wife and\nthus make Her comfortable.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n4-9. Thus ordered, Chitrarupa started immediately and reached at once Vaiku\n_nt_ ha, the highest place, covered all over by the Vai _sn_ avas. The place\nwas diversified with lots of various trees, with hundreds of lovely lakes, and\nechoed with sweet lovely sounds of swans, Karan _d_ avas, peacocks, parrots,\ncuckoos and various other birds and adorned with beautiful places, decked with\nflags and banners. It was filled with charming dancings, music and other\nartistic things. There were the lovely Bakula, As\xc2\x92oka, Tilaka, Champaka and\nother trees; and the beautiful tree Mandara looked beautiful and shed all\naround the sweet fragrance of its sweet flowers for a long distance. Thus\nseeing the lovely nice palace of Vi _sn_ u and the two doorkeepers Jaya and\nVijaya standing with canes in their hands, Chitraratha bowed down to them and\nsaid :-- Well! You go quickly and inform the Supreme Soul Hari that a\nmessenger has come under the orders of the Bhagavan S\xc2\x92ulapa _n_ i and is now\nwaiting at His doors.\n\n\n\n10-18. Hearing his words, the intelligent Jaya went to Hari and, with folded\nhands, said :-- \xc2\x93O Thou Ocean of Mercy! O Kes\xc2\x92ava! O Lord of Rama! O Deva of\nthe Devas! A messenger has come from the Lord of Bhavani and is waiting at the\ndoors. I do not not know on what important business he has come. Please order\nwhether I will bring him before You or not. On hearing the Jaya\xc2\x92s words, Hari,\naware of the inner feelings, knew at once the cause and said :-- O Jaya! Bring\nbefore me the messenger come from Rudra. Thus hearing, Jaya called the S\xc2\x92iva\xc2\x92s\nservant, of a graceful form, and brought him to the presence of Janardana.\nChitrarupa, of variegated appearance, prostrated himself flat before Him in\nthe form of a stick and stood up and remained with folded hands. The Bhagavan\nNaraya _n_ a, Whose carrier is Garu _d_ a, saw that servant of S\xc2\x92iva, of\nvariegated appearance and full of all humility, and became very much\nastonished. The Lord of Kamala then smiled and asked Chitrarupa :-- \xc2\x93O Pure\nOne! Is it all well with Mahadeva, the Lord of the Devas and his other\nfamilies and attendants? On what business has He sent you here? What does He\nwant me to do? Or tell me if I have to do any other business of the gods.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n19-34. The messenger said :-- \xc2\x93O Thou, the Knower of all that is within one\xc2\x92s\nheart! There is nothing in this world hidden from Your knowledge; when is that\nwhich I will say unknown to you! O Thou, the Knower of present, past and\nfuture! I am now saying to you what S\xc2\x92ambhu has told me to inform You. He has\nsaid :-- O Lord! The Goddess Lak _s_ mi is Your dear consort. She, the\ndaughter of the Ocean, and the Bestower of all\n\n\n\np. 551\n\n\n\nsuccess, though an object fit to be meditated by Yak _s_ as, Kinnaras, Naras\nand Immortals, is now undergoing severe penance at the confluence of Kalindi\n(the Jumna, the daughter of Kalinda) and the Tamasa. What is there in the\nthree worlds that can be happy without that Mother of the worlds and the Giver\nof all desires? O Lotus-eyed One! What pleasure do You feel in abandoning Her?\nO All-pervading One! Even he who has no riches or who is very weak maintains\nhis wife; then why have You, being the Lord of the worlds, forsaken your wife,\nwithout any offence, Who is worshipped by the whole universe. O Lord of the\nworld! What advice shall I give to You? He whose wife suffers in the world, is\nblamed by his enemies. O Omnipresent One! Fie on his such a life! O Lord of\nthe worlds! Your enemies\xc2\x92 desires are satisfied when they see Her very\nmiserable. They are laughing and mocking and saying :-- O Devi, Kes\xc2\x92ava has\nnow forsaken you; you can spend happily your time with us now. Therefore, O\nLord of the Devas! Bring that Lady back unto your palace and place Her unto\nyour lap, Who is of good demeanour, beautiful, par excellence and endowed with\nall auspicious signs. O Deva! Accept, please, your sweet-smiling wife and be\nhappy. Though I am at present not in bereavement of my dear wife, yet when I\nremember my former state of bereavement, I feel very much trouble. O Lotus-\neyed One! When Sati Devi, my beloved Wife, quitted Her life, in Dak _s_ a\xc2\x92s\nhouse, I felt unbearable pain, O Kes\xc2\x92ava! Let no other body in this world\nsuffer such pain, I now remember only the suffering and mental agonies that I\nfelt on Her bereavement; I do not give it out to others. After a long time,\npractising severe Tapasya (asceticism) I got Her back in the form of Girija,\nwho felt herself burnt up as it were by the anger She felt on account of\ncensure cast on Me in the Dak _s_ a\xc2\x92s house and thus quitted Her life. O\nMurari! What happiness you have felt in forsaking your dear wife and in\nremaining thus alone for one thousand years. Console your fortunate young wife\nwith good teeth and bring her back to your place. O Bhagavan! Lastly, the Lord\nBhavani, the Originatrix of these worlds, told me to speak thus to you :-- O\nDestroyer of Ka _m_ sa! Let nobody remain even, for a moment, without Lak _s_\nmi, the Highest Goddess. O Long-lived One! You better assume the form of a\nhorse and go and worship her. Then have a child of yours in the womb of your\nsweet-smiling wife and bring her back to your house.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n35-42. Vyasa said :-- O Ornament of Bharata\xc2\x92s race! Hearing thus the words of\nChitrarupa, Bhagavan Hari told that he would do what S\xc2\x92ankara had told him to\ndo and thus sent the messenger back to S\xc2\x92ankara. The messenger departing, Hari\nassumed the form of a beautiful horse\n\n\n\np. 552\n\n\n\nand immediately left Vaiku _nt_ ha with a passionate intent for the place\nwhere Lak _s_ mi was staying in the form of a mare and practising her\nausterities. Coming there, he saw that the Devi Bimala was staying in the form\nof a mare. The mare, too, seeing the horse form of her husband Govinda,\nrecognised him and, chaste as she was, remained there with astonishment and\ntears in her eyes. Then those two copulated on the famous confluence. The wife\nof Hari, in the shape of a mare, became pregnant and, in due time, gave birth\nto a beautiful well qualified child. The Bhagavan then graciously smiled on\nher and spoke in words suited to the time, \xc2\x93O Dear! Now quit this mare form\nand assume your former appearance. O Lovely-eyed One! Let both of us assume\nour own forms and go to Vaiku _nt_ ha; and let your child remain in this\nplace.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n43-48. Lak _s_ mi said :-- \xc2\x93O Lord! How can I go leaving here this child, born\nof my womb. It is very difficult to quit the attachments for one\xc2\x92s own child.\nKnow this, O Lord! O High-souled One! This child is young and of small body;\ntherefore it is quite incapable to protect itself. If I forsake it on the bank\nof this river, it will be an orphan, what will happen to it then? O Lotus-eyed\nOne! My mind is now in full attachment towards it. How can I quit this\nhelpless child and go?\xc2\x94 When Lak _s_ mi and Naraya _n_ a resumed their divine\nbodies and mounted on the excellent Vimanas, the Devas began to praise them\nwith hymns. When Naraya _n_ a expressed his desire to go, Kamala said :-- \xc2\x93O\nLord! You better take this child; I am unable to forsake it. O Lord! O Slayer\nof Madhu! This child is dearer to me than my life; see its body resembles\nexactly like you. Therefore we would take this child with us to Vaiku _nt_\nha.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n49-54. Hari spoke :-- \xc2\x93O Dear! You need not be sorry; let this child remain\nhere happily; I have arranged for its preservation and safety. O Beautiful\nOne! There is a great act to do in this world. That will be executed by your\nchild. For this reason I am leaving it here. I am now describing to you the\nabove story. The famous King Yayati had a son named Turvasu; his father kept\nhis name as Hari Varma; he is known by this name. That king is now practising\nasceticism for getting a son for one hundred years in a place of pilgrimage. O\nLak _s_ mi! I have begot this son for him. I will go there and send the King\nhere. O Beautiful-faced One! I will give this son to that King, desirous of an\nissue. He will take this son and go back to his house.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n55\\. Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus consoling his beloved, whose abode is in the\nLotus and placing the child there in that position, He mounted on an excellent\ncar with Lak _s_ mi and went to Vaiku _nt_ ha.\n\n\n\np. 553\n\n\n\nHere ends the Nineteenth Chapter in the Sixth Book on the origin of Haihayas\nfrom a mare in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses\nby Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 20](bk06ch20.htm)\n\n'
