Thee for vigour. Ye are breezes.  \nTo noblest work God Savitar impel you. Inviolable! swell  \nhis share for Indra.  \nNo thief, no evil-minded man shall master you rich in off-spring,  \nfree from pain and sickness.  \nBe constant, numerous to this lord of cattle. Guard thou  \nthe cattle of the Sacrificer.\n\np. 2\n\n2 Strainer of Vasu art thou. Thou art heaven. Earth art  \nthou. Thou art Matarisvan's caldron.  \nThou art the All-container. Stand thou firmly, secure by  \nLaw Supreme, and do not totter. Nor be thy Lord of  \nSacrifice unsteady.  \n3 Thou art the strainer, hundred-streamed, of Vasu. Thou  \nart the strainer, thousand-streamed, of Vasu.  \nMay Savitar the God with Vasu's strainer, thousand-streamed,  \nrightly cleansing, purify thee.  \n4 Which didst thou milk? This is the cow Visvayu. This  \nVisvakarman. This is Visvadhayas.  \nThee, Indra's share, with Soma do I curdle. Be thou protector  \nof the oblation, Vishnu.  \n5 I will observe the vow, Lord of Vows, Agni! May I have  \nstrength therefor. Success attend me.  \nNow into truth from untruth do I enter.  \n6 Who is it that unites thee? He unites thee. For what  \ndoth he yoke thee? For that he yokes thee.  \nYou two for work, you two for its completion.\n\np. 3\n\n7 Scorched are the fiends, scorched the malignant beings.  \nBurnt out are fiends, burnt out malignant beings.  \nThroughout the spacious middle air I travel.  \n8 Thou art the yoke. Injure thou him who injures. Harm  \nhim who harm us. Harm the man we injure.  \nThou art the Gods\xc2\x92 best carrier, bound most firmly, filled  \nfullest, welcomest, Gods\xc2\x92 best invoker.  \n9 Thou art unbent, receiver of oblations. Stand firmly in thy  \nplace and do not totter.  \nNor be thy Lord of sacrifice unsteady.  \nLet Vishnu mount thee. To the wind lie open. The demons  \nare expelled. Let the five grasp it.  \n10 By impulse of God Savitar I take thee with arms of Asvins,  \nwith the hands of Pushan,  \nThee dear to Agni, dear to Agni-Soma.  \n11 Thee for abundance, not for evil spirit. May mine eye look  \nupon the light of heaven.\n\np. 4\n\nMay those with doors stand on the earth securely. Throughout  \nthe spacious middle air I travel.  \nUpon the navel of the earth I place thee, on Aditi's lap.  \nProtect the oblation, Agni!  \n12 Ye two are strainers that belong to Vishnu. By Savitar's  \nimpulse, with this flawless strainer I purify you with the  \nrays of Surya.  \nBright Waters, flowing forward, foremost drinkers, lead forward  \nnow this sacrifice, lead forward the Sacrifice's Lord,  \nthe God-devoted Lord of the Sacrifice, the liberal giver.  \n13 Indra elected you in fight with Vritra: in fight with Vritra  \nyou elected Indra.  \nBy over-sprinkling are ye consecrated. I sprinkle thee  \nagreeable to Agni. I sprinkle thee welcome to Agni-Soma.  \nPure for the work divine be ye, and holy, pure for the sacrifice  \nto Gods. Whatever of yours the impure have by their  \ntouch polluted, hereby I cleanse for you from all defilement.  \n14 Giver art thou of happiness. Rejected are fiends, rejected  \nare malignant beings.  \nAditi's akin art thou. May Aditi receive thee. A wooden  \nstone art thou. Thou art a broad-based stone. May the  \nskin of Aditi receive thee.  \n15 Body of Agni art thou, the releaser of speech. I seize thee  \nfor the Gods\xc2\x92 enjoyment.  \nA mighty stone art thou, formed out of timber.\n\np. 5\n\nMake ready for the Deities this oblation: with careful preparation  \nmake it ready.  \nHavishkrit, come! Havishkrit, come! Havishkrit, come!  \n16 Thou art a cock whose tongue is sweet with honey. Call to  \nus hither sap and manly vigour.  \nMay we with thee in every fight be victors. Rain-grown art  \nthou. May the rain-grown receive thee.  \nCleared off are fiends, cleared off are evil beings. Expelled  \nare fiends. May Vayu separate you. May Savitar the  \nGod, the golden-handed, with flawless hand unto himself  \nreceive you.  \n17 Bold art thou. Cast away the Corpse-consumer. Drive off  \nthe fire that eats raw flesh, O Agni.  \nThat which makes offerings to the Gods bring hither.  \nFirm art thou. Make earth firm. For the foe's slaughter I  \nset thee on, devoted to the priesthood, devoted to the  \nnobles and the kinsmen.  \n18 Agni, do thou accept our holy service.  \nKeeper art thou: make firm the Air's mid-region. For the  \nfoe's death I set thee on, devoted to priesthood and nobility  \nand kinsmen.  \nThou art a stay: uphold the sky securely. For the foe's  \ndeath, etc.  \nI set thee on for sake of all the regions. Formers of layers  \nare ye, and heap-formers, With Bhrigus\xc2\x92 and Angirases\xc2\x92  \nheat be heated.\n\np. 6\n\n19 Giver of happiness art thou. Rejected are fiends, rejected  \nare malignant beings. Aditi's skin art thou, May Aditi  \nreceive thee.  \nBowl, rock art thou. May Aditi's skin receive thee.  \nThou art the sky's supporting pillar.  \nBowl from the rock art thou. The rock receive thee.  \n20 Grain art thou. Please the Gods. Thee for in-breathing.  \nFor out-breath thee. Thee for diffusive breathing. May  \nI impart to life a long extension.  \nMay Savitar the God, the golden-handed, with flawless hand  \nunto himself receive you.  \nThee for the eye. Juice art thou of the Great Ones.  \n21 By impulse of God Savitar I strew thee, with arms of Asvins,  \nwith the hands of Basilan.  \nWith plants let waters, plants with sap he mingled. United  \nbe the rich ones with the moving. The sweet ones and  \nthe sweet be joined together.  \n22 For generation's sake I join thee. This is Agni's. This Agni-Soma's.  \nThee for food.  \nThou art the caldron, life of all that liveth. Spread thyself  \nwidely forth, thou, widely spreading. So may thy Lord of  \nsacrifice spread widely.  \nThy skin let Agni harm not. In highest heaven let the God  \nSavitar hake thee.  \n23 Fear not. Shrink not. Let not the sacrifice be languid, not  \nlanguid he the Sacrificer's offspring.  \nFor Trita thee. For Dvita thee. For Ekata thee.\n\np. 7\n\n24 By impulse of God Savitar I take thee, with arms of Asvins,  \nwith the hands of Pushan, thee who for Gods performest  \nsacred service.  \nIndra's right arm art thou: sharp with a thousand spikes,  \na hundred edges. The keen-edged Wind art thou, the  \nfoeman's slayer.  \n25 O Earth, whereon men serve the Gods with worship, let me  \nnot do thy plant's root any damage.  \nGo to the pen, the cowstall. Heaven rain for thee.  \nOn this earth's farthest end, God Savitar, bind him, with  \nhundred fetters bind the man who hates us and whom  \nwe hate. Thence do not thou [release](errata.htm#0) him.  \n26 May I drive Araru away from Earth, the seat of men's oblations  \nto the Gods. Go to the pen . . . . . . . release him  \n(as in verse 25).  \nO Araru, thou shalt not soar to heaven. Let not thy drop  \nmount upward to the sky.  \nGo to the pen . . . . . . . release him (as in verse 25).  \n27 I with the metre Gayatri enclose thee. I lay the Trishtup  \nmetre round about thee. With Jagati metre I confine  \nand gird thee.\n\np. 8\n\nSprung from good soil art thou, and bliss-bestowing. Pleasant  \nart thou, and a fair seat to rest on. Thou hast both  \nstrengthening food and drink in plenty.  \n28 Before the cruel foe's secret departure, Mighty One, raising  \nhigh earth, life-bestower, which to the Moon they lifted  \nby oblations, that earth the sages still point out and worship.  \nDeposit in its place the sprinkling-water, Thou art the slayer  \nof the man who hates us.  \n29 Scorched are the demons, scorched the evil beings. Burnt  \nout are fiends, burnt out malignant creatures.  \nUnsharpened, thou art slayer of the foemen. Thee, rich in  \nfood, I cleanse for the food's kindling.  \nScorched . . . . . creatures (as above).  \nThee rich in food, I cleanse for the food's kindling.  \n30 A zone for Aditi art thou. Pervader of Vishnu art thou.  \nFor great strength I take thee. I look upon thee with an  \neye uninjured.  \nThou art the tongue of Agni. Good invoker of Gods be  \nthou at every holy station, at every sacrificial text I utter.  \n31 By Savitar's impulsion do I cleanse thee, with flawless  \nstrainer, with the rays of Surya.  \nBy Savitar's impulsion do I cleanse you, with flawless strainer,  \nwith the rays of Surya.  \nLight art thou; thou art splendid; thou art Amrit. Thou,  \ntruly, art the Gods\xc2\x92 beloved station, inviolable means of  \nholy worship.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book II](wyvbk02.htm)\n\n"
