Of them, being all\nalike, all good, three desired, 'May we be superior 3!'--Agni, Indra, and\nSurya.\n\n4:5:4:22\\. They went on praising and toiling. They saw those Atigrahyas 4, and\ndrew (grah) them for themselves\n\np. 403\n\nover and above (ati): hence the name Atigrahyas. They became superior, even as\nthey are now superior 1 and verily he becomes superior for whomsoever, knowing\nthis, they draw those cups of Soma.\n\n4:5:4:33\\. And at first there was not in Agni that lustre which is now in him.\nHe desired, 'May that lustre be in me!' He saw this graha, and drew it for\nhimself, and henceforth that lustre was in him.\n\np. 404\n\n4:5:4:44\\. And at first there was not in Indra that power which is now in him.\nHe desired, 'May that power be in me!' He saw this graha and drew it for\nhimself, and henceforth that power was in him.\n\n4:5:4:55\\. And at first there was not in Surya that splendour which is now in\nhim. He desired, 'May that splendour be in me!' He saw this graha and drew it\nfor himself, and henceforth that splendour was in him. And verily for\nwhomsoever, knowing this, they draw those cups of Soma, he takes unto himself\nthose same fires (energies), those same powers.\n\n4:5:4:66\\. Let him draw them at the morning pressing, after drawing the \xc3\x82graya\n_n_ a; for the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a is the self (body), and many parts of this self\nare one each (and thus) over and above (the others), such as the lung 1 and\nheart, and others.\n\n4:5:4:77\\. Or he might draw them from the Putabh _ri_ t, at the midday\npressing, after drawing the Ukthya, or when about to bespeak (the chant), for\nthe Ukthya indeed is the same as that undefined self of his. But this is mere\nspeculation: let him rather draw them at the morning pressing, after drawing\nthe \xc3\x82graya _n_ a.\n\n4:5:4:88\\. They are offered after the offering of the Mahendra graha; for\nthat, the Mahendra, is Indra's special cup; and so are the (Nishkevalya)\nstotra and _s_ astra specially his. But the sacrificer is Indra; and for the\nsacrificer's benefit (these cups) are drawn: therefore they are offered after\nthe offering of the Mahendra graha.\n\n4:5:4:99\\. He thus draws them therefrom [the first with\n\np. 405\n\n[paragraph continues] Va _g_. S. VIII, 38; Rig-veda IX, 66, 21] 1, 'O Agni,\nskilful in works, become thou pure, bestowing upon us lustre and manly vigour,\nand upon me health and wealth!--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Agni,\nfor lustre!--This is thy womb: thee to Agni, for lustre!'\n\n4:5:4:1010\\. [The second with Va _g_. S. VIII, 39; Rig-veda VIII, 76, 10],\n'Uprising by thy power didst thou move thy jaws, O Indra, drinking the cup-\ndrawn juice!--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Indra for power!--This is\nthy womb: thee to Indra for power!'\n\n4:5:4:1111\\. [The third with Va _g_. S. VIII, 40; Rig-veda I, 50, 3], 'His\nbeacons have appeared, his beams, wide and far over the people, shining\nsplendidly like fires!--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Surya for\nsplendour!--This is thy womb: thee to Surya for splendour!'\n\n4:5:4:1212\\. The drinking of these (cups is performed by the sacrificers with\nthe resp. texts), 'O lustrous Agni, lustrous art thou among the gods: may I be\nlustrous among men!--Most powerful Indra, most powerful art thou among the\ngods: may I be the most powerful among men!--Most splendid Surya, most\nsplendid art thou among the gods: may I be the most splendid among men!' And,\nverily, these same splendours, these same powers he takes unto himself for\nwhomsoever, knowing this, they draw these cups.\n\n4:5:4:1313\\. Let him draw them on the first three days of the P _ri_ sh _th_\nya sha _d_ aha 2; namely, the Agni cup on\n\np. 406\n\nthe first day, the Indra cup on the second, the Surya cup on the third--thus\none day by day.\n\n4:5:4:1414\\. Some 1, however, draw them on the last three days; but let him\nnot do so: let him rather draw them on the first three days. But should he\nintend to draw them on the last three days, let him first draw them on the\nfirst three days and let him then draw them on the last three days. In like\nmanner they are drawn (all three) in their proper order, on one and the same\nday, at the Vi _s_ va _g_ it 2 with all the P _ri_ sh _th_ as.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[402:2](sbe2663.htm#fr_943) The Dvada _s_ aha, or twelve days' performance,\nforms the connecting link between the so-called Ahina sacrifices (consisting\nof between two and twelve press-days) and the sattras, or sacrificial sessions\n(of twelve press-days and upwards); since it can be performed as one or the\nother. As a sattra (which seems to be its usual character) it consists of the\nDa _s_ aratra, or ten nights' (or days') period, preceded and followed by an\nAtiratra, as the praya _n_ iya (opening) and udayaniya (concluding) days. The\nDa _s_ aratra, on its part, consists of three tryahas (or tridua), viz. a P\n_ri_ sh _th_ ya sha _d_ aha (see note  4), and three Ukthya days, the so-\ncalled _Kh_ andomas (on which see Haug, Ait. Br. Transl. p. 347). These are\nfollowed by an Atyagnish _t_ oma day, called Avivakya (i.e. on which there\nshould be 'no dispute, or quarrel').\n\n[402:3](sbe2663.htm#fr_940) Ati-tish _th_ avana _h_ , lit. 'standing forth\nover (all others,' see [IV, 5, 3, 2](sbe2662.htm#4:5:3:2)). In this, as in the\npreceding Brahma _n_ a, the prefix ati has to do service repeatedly for\netymological and symbolical purposes.\n\n[402:4](sbe2663.htm#fr_942) I.e. cups of Soma 'to be drawn over and above'\n(Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, 235; for a different explanation see Haug, Ait. Br.\nTransl. p. 490). These three grahas are required at the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya sha\n_d_ aha, which forms part of the Dvada _s_ aha (see note  2), and of\nsacrificial sessions generally. The sha _d_ aha, or period of six Soma days,\nwhich (though itself consisting of two tryaha, or p. 403 tridua) may be\nconsidered as forming a kind of unit in sattras, or sacrificial sessions, is\nof two kinds, viz. the Abhiplava sha _d_ aha and the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya sha _d_\naha. Both require (for the Hot _ri_ 's p _ri_ sh _th_ a-stotra at the midday\npressing) the use of the Rathantara-saman on uneven, and that of the B _ri_\nhat-saman on even days. The chief difference between them is that while the p\n_ri_ sh _th_ a-stotras of the Abhiplava are performed in the ordinary (Agnish\n_t_ oma) way, the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya sha _d_ aha requires their performance in\nthe proper p _ri_ sh _th_ a form, see [p. 339](sbe2652.htm#page_339), note\n[2](sbe2652.htm#fn_801). Besides, while the Abhiplava sha _d_ aha consists of\nfour Ukthya days, preceded and followed by one Agnish _t_ oma day; the first\nday of the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya sha _d_ aha is an Agnish _t_ oma, the fourth a\nSho _d_ a _s_ in, the remaining four days being Ukthyas. There is also a\ndifference between the two in regard to the stomas, or forms of chanting,\nused; for while the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya requires successively one of the six\nprincipal stomas (from the Triv _ri_ t up to the Trayastri _m_ _s_ a, as given\n[p. 308](sbe2649.htm#page_308), note [2](sbe2649.htm#fn_745)) for each day,\nthe Abhiplava requires the first four stomas (Triv _ri_ t to Ekavi _m_ _s_ a)\nfor each day, though in a different order. In this respect, three groups or\nforms are assumed for the performance of the stotras at the Agnish _t_ oma and\nUkthya, viz. the _G_ yotish _t_ oma [a. Bahishpavavamana in the Triv _ri_ t;\nb. \xc3\x82 _g_ yastotras and c. Madhyandina-pavamana in the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a; d.\nthe P _ri_ sh _th_ a-stotras and e. \xc3\x82rbhava-pavavamana in the Saptada _s_ a;\nand f. the Agnish _t_ oma saman in the Ekavi _m_ _s_ a stoma]; the Gosh _t_\noma [a. Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a; b. Triv _ri_ t; c. Saptada _s_ a; e. f. (and g.\nUkthastotras) Ekavi _m_ _s_ a]; and \xc3\x82yush _t_ oma [a. Triv _ri_ t; b. Pa _\xc3\xb1_\n_k_ ada _s_ a; c. d. Saptada _s_ a; e. f. g. Ekavi _m_ _s_ a]. These forms are\ndistributed over the two tridua of the Abhiplava in the order: _G_ yotish _t_\noma, Gosh _t_ oma, \xc3\x82yush _t_ oma; Gosh _t_ oma, \xc3\x82yush _t_ oma, Gyotish _t_\noma.\n\n[403:1](sbe2663.htm#fr_944) Lit. even as they are now the superiority, i.e. a\nsuperior power.\n\n[404:1](sbe2663.htm#fr_945) That is, the right lung (kloman), the left lung\nbeing called by a different name. See St. Petersb. Dict. s. v.\n\n[405:1](sbe2663.htm#fr_946) The Ka _n_ vas use a different formula, viz. Rig-\nveda IX, 66, 19. See Va _g_. S. ed. Weber, p. 254 (XII).\n\n[405:2](sbe2663.htm#fr_947) See page [402](sbe2662.htm#page_402), note 4. In\nconjunction with the Rathantara p. 406 (Sama-veda II, 30-31) and B _ri_ hat\n(II, 159-60) samans, the other four principal p _ri_ sh _th_ a samans--viz.\nthe Vairupa (II, 212-13), Vaira _g_ a (II, 277-9), _S_ akvara (II, 1151-3; or\nMahanamni, 1-3), and Raivata (II, 434-6)--are used respectively by the Hot\n_ri_ on the last four days of the sha _d_ aha. As regards the Hot _ri_ 's\nassistants, while the Maitravaru _n_ a always uses the same saman, as at the\nAgnish _t_ oma, viz. the Vamadevya (II, 32-34), the samans used by the other\nHotrakas are given in the Sama-veda immediately after the respective saman of\nthe Hot _ri_ , mentioned above.\n\n[406:1](sbe2663.htm#fr_948) The Ka _n_ va text ascribes this practice to the\n_K_ arakas.\n\n[406:2](sbe2663.htm#fr_949) Regarding the sacrificial session, called Gavam\nayana, of which the Vi _s_ va _g_ it forms part, see [p.\n426](sbe2670.htm#page_426), note [3](sbe2671.htm#fn_988).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 5, 5.
