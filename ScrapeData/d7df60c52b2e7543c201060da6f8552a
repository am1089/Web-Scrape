But you must, at the same\ntime, remember that these divisions are not very marked and quite exclusive of\neach other. Each blends into the other. But according to the type which\nprevails we name the divisions. It is not that you cannot find a man who has\nno other faculty than that of work, nor that you cannot find men who are more\nthan devoted worshippers only, nor that there are not men who have more than\nmere knowledge. These divisions are made in accordance with the type or the\ntendency that may be seen to prevail in a man. We have found that, in the end,\nall these four paths converge and become one. All religions and all methods of\nwork and worship lead us to one and the same goal.\n\nI have already tried to point out that goal. It is freedom as I understand it.\nEverything that we perceive around us is struggling towards freedom, from the\natom to the man, from the insentient, lifeless particle of matter to the\nhighest existence on earth, the human soul. The whole universe is in fact the\nresult of this struggle for freedom. In all combinations every particle is\ntrying to go on its own way, to fly from the other particles; but the others\nare holding it in check. Our earth is trying to fly away from the sun, and the\nmoon from the earth. Everything has a tendency to infinite dispersion. All\nthat we see in the universe has for its basis this one struggle towards\nfreedom; it is under the impulse of this tendency that the saint prays and the\nrobber robs. When the line of action taken is not a proper one we call it\nevil, and when the\n\np. 107\n\nmanifestation of it is proper and high we call it good. But the impulse is the\nsame, the struggle towards freedom. The saint is oppressed with the knowledge\nof his condition of bondage, and he wants to get rid of it; so he worships\nGod. The thief is oppressed with the idea that he does not possess certain\nthings, and he tries to get rid of that want, to obtain freedom from it; so he\nsteals. Freedom is the one goal of all nature, sentient or insentient; and,\nconsciously or [unconsciously](errata.htm#4), everything is struggling towards\nthat goal. The freedom which the saint seeks is very different from that which\nthe robber seeks; the freedom loved by the saint leads him to the enjoyment of\ninfinite, unspeakable bliss, while that on which the robber has set his heart\nonly forges other bonds for his soul.\n\nThere is to be found in every religion the manifestation of this struggle\ntowards freedom. It is the groundwork of all morality, of unselfishness, which\nmeans getting rid of the idea that men are the same as their little body. When\nwe see a man doing good work, helping others, it means that he cannot be\nconfined within the limited circle of \'me and mine\'. There is no limit to this\ngetting out of selfishness. All the great systems of ethics preach absolute\nunselfishness as the goal. Supposing this absolute unselfishness can be\nreached by a man, what becomes of him? He is no more the little Mr. So-and-so;\nhe has acquired infinite expansion. That little personality which he had\nbefore is now lost to him for ever; he has become infinite, and the attainment\nof this infinite expansion is indeed the goal of all religions and of all\nmoral and philosophical teachings. The personalist, when he hears this idea\nphilosophically put, gets frightened. At the same time, if he preaches\nmorality, he after all teaches the very same idea himself. He puts no limit to\nthe unselfishness of man. Suppose a man becomes perfectly unselfish under the\npersonalistic system, how are we to distinguish him from the perfected ones in\nother systems? He has\n\np. 108\n\nbecome one with the universe and to become that is the goal of all; only the\npoor personalist has not the courage to follow out his own reasoning to its\nright conclusion. _Karma-Yoga_ is the attaining through unselfish work of that\nfreedom which is the goal of all human nature. Every selfish action,\ntherefore, retards our reaching the goal, and every unselfish action takes us\ntowards the goal; that is why the only definition that can be given of\nmorality is this:-- _That which is selfish is immoral, and that which is\nunselfish is moral_.\n\nBut, if you come to details, the matter will not be seen to be quite so\nsimple. For instance, environment often makes the details different as I have\nalready mentioned. The same action under one set of circumstances may be\nunselfish, and under another set quite selfish. So we can give only a general\ndefinition, and leave the details to be worked out by taking into\nconsideration the differences in time, place and circumstances. In one country\none kind of conduct is considered moral, and in another the very same is\nimmoral, because the circumstances differ. The goal of all nature is freedom,\nand freedom is to be attained only by perfect unselfishness; every thought,\nword or deed that is unselfish takes us towards the goal, and, as such, is\ncalled moral. That definition, you will find, holds good in every religion and\nevery system of ethics. In some systems of thought morality is derived from a\nSuperior Being--God. If you ask why a man ought to do this and not that, their\nanswer is: "Because such is the command of God." But whatever be the source\nfrom which it is derived, their code of ethics also has the same central idea\n--not to think of self but to give up self. And yet some persons, in spite of\nthis high ethical idea, are frightened at the thought of having to give up\ntheir little personalities. We may ask the man who clings to the idea of\nlittle personalities to consider the case of a person who has become perfectly\nunselfish, who has no thought for himself,\n\np. 109\n\nwho does no deed for himself, who speaks no word for himself, Band then say\nwhere his \'himself\' is. That \'himself\' is known to him only so long as he\nthinks, acts or speaks for himself. If he is only conscious of others, of the\nuniverse, and of the all, where is his \'himself\'? It is gone for ever.\n\n_Karma-Yoga_ , therefore, is a system of ethics and religion intended to\nattain freedom through unselfishness, and by good works. The _Karma-Yogi_ need\nnot believe in any doctrine whatever. He may not believe even in God, may not\nask what his soul is, nor think of any metaphysical speculation. He has got\nhis own special aim of realising selflessness; and he has to work it out\nhimself. Every moment of his life must be realisation because he has to solve\nby mere work, without the help of doctrine or theory, the very same problem to\nwhich the _Jnani_ applies his reason and inspiration and the _Bhakta_ his\nlove.\n\nNow comes the next question: What is this work? What is this doing good to the\nworld? Can we do good to the world? In an absolute sense, no in a relative\nsense, yes. No permanent or everlasting good can be done to the world; if it\ncould be done, the world would not be this world. We may satisfy the hunger of\na man for five minutes, but he will be hungry again. Every pleasure with which\nwe supply a man may be seen to be momentary. No one can permanently cure this\never-recurring fever of pleasure and pain. Can any permanent happiness be\ngiven to the world? In the ocean we cannot raise a wave without causing a\nhollow somewhere else. The sum-total of the good things in the world has been\nthe same throughout in its relation to man\'s need and greed. It cannot be\nincreased or decreased. Take the history of the human race as we know to-day.\nDo we not find the same miseries and the same happiness, the same pleasures\nand pains, the same differences in position? Are not some rich, some poor,\nsome high, some low, some healthy, some unhealthy?\n\np. 110\n\n[paragraph continues] All this was just the same with the Egyptians, the\nGreeks, and the Romans in ancient times as it is with the Americans to-day. So\nfar as history is known, it has always been the same; yet at the same time we\nfind, that running along with all these incurable differences of pleasure and\npain, there has ever been the struggle to alleviate them. Every period of\nhistory has given birth to thousands of men and women who have worked hard to\nsmooth the passage of life for others. And how far have they succeeded? We can\nonly play at driving the ball from one place to another. We take away pain\nfrom the physical plane, and it goes to the mental one. It is like that\npicture in Dante\'s hell where the misers were given a mass of gold to roll up\na hill. Every time they rolled it up a little, it again rolled down. All our\ntalks about the millennium are very nice as school-boys\' stories, but they are\nno better than that. All nations that dream of the millennium also think, that\nof all peoples in the world, they will have the best of it then for\nthemselves. This is the wonderfully unselfish idea of the millennium!\n\nWe cannot add happiness to this world; similarly, we cannot add pain to it\neither. The sum-total of the energies of pleasure and pain displayed here on\nearth will be the same throughout. We just push it from this side to the other\nside, and from that side to this, but it will remain the same, because to\nremain so is its very nature. This ebb and flow, this rising and falling, is\nin the world\'s very nature; it would be as logical to hold otherwise as to say\nthat we may have life without death. This is complete nonsense, because the\nvery idea of life implies death and the very idea of pleasure implies pain.\nThe lamp is constantly burning out, and that is its life. If you want to have\nlife you have to die every moment for it. Life and death are only different\nexpressions of the same thing, looked at from different standpoints; they are\nthe falling and the rising of the same wave, and the two form one\n\np. 111\n\nwhole. One looks at the \'fall\' side and becomes a pessimist, another looks at\nthe \'rise\' side and becomes an optimist. When a boy is going to school and his\nfather and mother are taking care of him, everything seems blessed to him; his\nwants are simple, he is a great optimist. But the old man, with his varied\nexperience, becomes calmer, and is sure to have his warmth considerably cooled\ndown. So, old nations, with signs of decay all around them, are apt to be less\nhopeful than new nations. There is a proverb in India. "A thousand years a\ncity, and a thousand years forest." This change of city into forest and _vice\nversa_ is going on everywhere, and it makes people optimists or pessimists\naccording to the side they see of it.\n\nThe next idea we take up is the idea of equality. These millennium ideas have\nbeen great motive powers to work. Many religions preach this as an element in\nthem,--that God is coming to rule the universe, and that then there will be no\ndifference at all in conditions. The people who preach this doctrine are mere\nfanatics, and fanatics are indeed the sincerest of mankind. Christianity was\npreached just on the basis of the fascination of this fanaticism, and that is\nwhat made it so attractive to the Greek and the Roman slaves. They believed\nthat under the millennial religion there would be no more slavery, that there\nwould be plenty to eat and drink; and therefore .they flocked round the\nChristian standard. Those who preached the idea first were of course ignorant\nfanatics, but very sincere. In modern times this millennial aspiration takes\nthe form of equality--of liberty, equality and fraternity. This is also\nfanaticism. True equality has never been and never can be on earth. How can we\nall be equal here? This impossible kind of equality implies total death. What\nmakes this world what it is? Lost balance. In the primal state, which is\ncalled chaos, there is perfect balance. How do all the formative forces of the\nuniverse come then? By struggling, competition, conflict.\n\np. 112\n\n[paragraph continues] Suppose that all the particles of matter were held in\nequilibrium, would there be then any process of creation? We know from science\nthat it is impossible. Disturb a sheet of water, and there you find every\nparticle of the water trying to become calm again, one rushing against the\nother; and in the same way all the phenomena which we call the universe--all\nthings therein--are struggling to get back to the state of perfect balance.\nAgain a disturbance comes, and again we have combination and creation.\nInequality is the very basis of creation. At the same time the forces\nstruggling to obtain equality are as much a necessity of creation as those\nwhich destroy it.\n\nAbsolute equality, that which means a perfect balance of all the struggling\nforces in all the planes, can never be in this world. Before you attain that\nstate, the world will have become quite unfit for any kind of life, and no one\nwill be there. We find, therefore, that all these ideas of the millennium and\nof absolute equality are not only impossible but also that, if we try to carry\nthem out, they will lead us surely enough to the day of destruction. What\nmakes the difference between man and man? It is largely the difference in the\nbrain. Nowadays no one but a lunatic will say that we are all born with the\nsame brain power. We come into the world with unequal endowments; we come as\ngreater men or as lesser men, and there is no getting away from that pre-\nnatally determined condition. The American Indians were in this country for\nthousands of years, and a few handfuls of your ancestors came to their land.\nWhat difference have they caused in the appearance of the country! Why did not\nthe Indians make improvements and build cities, if all were equal? With your\nancestors a different sort of brain power came into the land, different\nbundles of past impressions came, and they worked out and manifested\nthemselves. Absolute non-differentiation is death. So long as this world\nlasts, differentiation there will and must be, and the millennium\n\np. 113\n\nof perfect equality will come only when a cycle of creation comes to its end.\nBefore that equality cannot be. Yet this idea of realising the millennium is a\ngreat motive power. Just as inequality is necessary for creation itself, so\nthe struggle to limit it is also necessary. If there were no struggle to\nbecome free and get back to God, there would be no creation either. It is the\ndifference between these two forces that determines the nature of the motives\nof men. There will always be these motives to work, some tending towards\nbondage and others towards freedom.\n\nThis world\'s wheel within wheel is terrible mechanism; if we put our hands in\nit, as soon as we are caught we are gone. We all think that when we have done\na certain duty, we shall be at rest; but before we have done a part of that\nduty another is already in waiting. We are all being dragged along by this\nmighty, complex world-machine. There are only two ways out of it; one is to\ngive up all concern with the machine, to let it go and stand aside, to give up\nour desires. That is very easy to say, but is almost impossible to do. I do\nnot know whether in twenty millions of men one can do that. The other way is\nto plunge into the world and learn the secret of work, and that is the way of\n_Karma-Yoga_. Do not fly away from the wheels of the world-machine, but stand\ninside it and learn the secret of work. Through proper work done inside, it is\nalso possible to come out. Through this machinery itself is the way out.\n\nWe have now seen what work is. It is a part of nature\'s foundation, and goes\non always. Those that believe in God understand this better, because they know\nthat God is not such an incapable being as will need our help. Although this\nuniverse will go on always, our goal is freedom; our goal is unselfishness;\nand according to _Karma-Yoga_ that goal is to be reached through work. All\nideas of making the world perfectly happy may be good as\n\np. 114\n\nmotive powers for fanatics; but we must know that fanaticism brings forth as\nmuch evil as good. The _Karma-Yogi_ asks why you require any motive to work\nother than the inborn love of freedom. Be beyond the common worthy motives;\n"To work you have the right, but not to the fruits thereof." Man can train\nhimself to know and to practise that, says the _Karma-Yogi_. When the idea of\ndoing good becomes a part of his very being, then he will not seek for any\nmotive outside. Let us do good because it is good to do good; he who does good\nwork even in order to get to heaven binds himself down, says the _Karma-Yogi_.\nAny work that is done with any the least selfish motive. instead of making us\nfree, forges one more chain for our feet.\n\nSo the only way is to give up all the fruits of work, to be unattached to\nthem. Know that this world is not we, nor are we this world; that we are\nreally not the body; that we really do not work. We are the Self, eternally at\nrest and at peace. Why should we be bound by anything? It is very good to say\nthat we should be perfectly nonattached, but what is the way to do it? Every\ngood work we do without any ulterior motive, instead of forging a new chain,\nwill break one of the links in the existing chains. Every good thought that we\nsend to the world without thinking of any return, will be stored up there and\nbreak one link in the chain, and make us purer and purer, until we become the\npurest of mortals. Yet all this may seem to be rather quixotic and too\nphilosophical, more theoretical than practical. I have read many arguments\nagainst the _Bhagavad-Gita_ , and many have said that without motives you\ncannot work. They have never seen unselfish work except under the influence of\nfanaticism, and therefore they speak in that way.\n\nLet me tell you in conclusion a few words about one man who actually carried\nthis teaching of _Karma-Yoga_ into practice. That man is Buddha. He is the one\nman\n\np. 115\n\nwho ever carried this into perfect practice. All the prophets of the world,\nexcept Buddha, had external motives to move them to unselfish action. The\nprophets of the world, with this single exception, may be divided into two\nsets, one set holding that they are incarnations of God come down on earth,\nand the other holding that they are only messengers from God; and both draw\ntheir impetus for work from outside, expect reward from outside, however\nhighly spiritual may be the language they use. But Buddha is the only prophet\nwho said, "I do not care to know your various theories about God. What is the\nuse of discussing all the subtle doctrines about the soul? Do good and be\ngood. And this will take you to freedom and to whatever truth there is." He\nwas, in the conduct of his life, absolutely without personal motives; and what\nman worked more than he? Show me in history one character who has soared so\nhigh above all. The whole human race has produced but one such character, such\nhigh philosophy, such wide sympathy. This great philosopher, preaching the\nhighest philosophy, yet had the deepest sympathy for the lowest of animals,\nand never put forth any claims for himself. He is the ideal _Karma-Yogi_ ,\nacting entirely without motive, and the history of humanity shows him to have\nbeen the greatest man ever born; beyond compare the greatest combination of\nheart and brain that ever existed, the greatest soul-power that has ever been\nmanifested. He is the first great reformer the world has seen. He was the\nfirst who dared to say, "Believe not because some old manuscripts are\nproduced, believe not because it is your national belief, because you have\nbeen made to believe it from your childhood; but reason it all out, and after\nyou have analysed it, then, if you find that it will do good to one and all\nbelieve it, live up to it, and help others to live up to it." He works best\nwho works without any motive, neither for money, nor for fame, nor for\nanything else; and when a man can\n\np. 116\n\ndo that, he will be a Buddha, and out of him will come the power to work in\nsuch a manner as will transform the world. This man represents the very\nhighest ideal of _Karma-Yoga_.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
