Janamejaya said :-- In whose family were born those K _s_ attriya\nHaihayas that killed in ancient times the Bhargavas, disregardless of the sin\nincurred in killing a Brahmi _n_? O Grandsire! Never do the good persons\nbecome angry without a serious cause; therefore kindly state why they got\nangry. How was the enmity caused between them and the priests? As far as I can\nthink, the cause is not so simple a one as led to this enmity between the K\n_s_ attriyas and the priests. Otherwise why then would they slay the\noffenseless Brahmi _n_ s, fit to be worshipped; and how was it that the K _s_\nattriyas, though they were so very powerful, did not fear to commit a sin. O\nMuni! Can any K _s_ attriya Chief kill a Brahmi _n_ , worthy of the highest\nrespect, merely on a trifling cause! Describe to me, then, how this happened.\nA great doubt has thus arisen in my mind.\n\n\n\n6\\. Suta said :-- O Ri _s_ is! Vyasa, the son of Satyavati, became very\npleased when he was asked this question by Janamejaya, and, recollecting the\nwhole course of events regarding the Haihayas, began to narrate it.\n\n\n\n7-22. Vyasa said :-- O son of Parik _si_ t! I will now narrate that wonderful\nstory of old that I know fully; now hear this very attentively. In ancient\ntimes there was a King named Kartaviryarjuna of the family of Haihaya. He was\nof thousand hands, powerful, and always ready to observe religious duties. He\nwas the incarnation of Hari, and the disciple of Mahar _s_ i Dattatreya and\nthe worshipper of the Supreme Force (\xc3\x82dya S\xc2\x92akti). He was well known as a\nperfect adept in the Yoga practices and of a very charitable disposition. But\nthis King was the client of the Brahmi _n_ s of the Bhargava clan. He was\nalways devoted to performing sacrifices, exceedingly religious, and always\nengaged in making gifts. So many a time did he perform the great sacrifices\nand gave a profuse quantity of wealth to the Bhargavas. Due to the gifts and\npresents of Karta Virya, the Bhargava priests became possessed of many horses,\nand gems and jewels and so became wealthy and prosperous on the surface of\nthis earth. O King! When Kartaviryarjuna, the best of Kings, left the mortal\ncoil and got up to Heavens, his descendants became entirely void of any wealth\n\n\n\np. 539\n\n\n\nby the indomitable influence of Time. Now, on a certain occasion, the Haihayas\nhad to perform certain actions which necessitated a vast sum of money; they\ncame to the Bhargavas and humbly prayed for a very large amount of wealth. But\nthe Brahmi _n_ s, out of their greed of money, replied they had no money and\nthus they did not give any money whatsoever. Rather the Bhargavas thought that\nthe Haihayas would perforce take their wealth, and, fearing thus, some of them\nburied all their valuables underneath the ground; and others gave as charities\nto the Brahma _n_ as. The greedy Bhargavas, bewildered with fear, thus\ntransferred all their properties elsewhere, quitted their homes and fled away\nto mountains and other places. The greedy Brahmi _n_ s did not give any wealth\nto their Yajamanas (their clients) though they saw them very much distressed;\nbut they fled away out of fear to mountains and fastnesses where they found\nshelter. At last the Haihayas, the best of the K _s_ attriyas, became very\nsorry till, at last, for the sake of their good actions, they went to the\nBhargavas\xc2\x92 houses for the sake of money and found they had quitted their homes\nand fled away; their homes were all vacant. Then they began to dig underneath\ntheir houses for money and some got the money thus. Then the K _s_ attriyas\nbegan to labour hard and got hordes of money from underneath the ground. Next\nthey raided upon other Brahma _n_ as\xc2\x92 houses and dug and excavated and\nsearched for more money. The Brahmi _n_ s were helpless and, crying, all took\ntheir refuge, out of fear, under the Bhargavas.\n\n\n\n23-42. The K _s_ attriyas made an exhaustive search of the Brahma _n_ as\xc2\x92\nhouses and got lots of money. They then charged the Brahma _n_ as as having\nhad spoken falsehood and they became very angry, and killed the Brahma _n_ as\nwith arrows who took their refuge. O King! The Haihayas were so very angry at\nthat time that they went wherever the Bhargavas took their shelter and cut\nasunder the foetus in the wombs of their Bhargavas\xc2\x92 wives and thus they roamed\nall over on the surface of the earth. Wherever they saw any Bhargava, be he a\nminor, or a youth or a old man, at once they killed him with sharp arrows,\ndisregarding the sin Brahmahattya. When the Bhargavas were thus all killed,\nthen they caught hold of their wives that were pregnant and destroyed their\nwombs. When the vicious K _s_ attriyas thus destroyed the lives in their\nwombs, the helpless women began to cry like the awe-stricken ewe. Then the\nother Munis, the inhabitants of the sacred places of pilgrimages, seeing the\nHaihaya K _s_ attriyas inflamed with anger, said :-- \xc2\x93O K _s_ attriyas! Quit\nyour terrible anger towards the Brahmi _n_ s. Being the best of the K _s_\nattriyas, you are killing the foetus in the wombs of the pregnant Brahma _n_ a\nladies! You are doing, no doubt, a very vicious and unjustifiable act! You\nshould\n\n\n\np. 540\n\n\n\nknow that an act, very bad or very good, bears fruit in this life; therefore\nthose that seek their welfare should entirely omit this exceedingly hateful\nand vicious act.\xc2\x94 Then the exceedingly angry Haihayas told the merciful\nascetics :-- You all are saints; therefore you do not know the real import of\nwhat are called vicious acts. Those Bhargavas, thoroughly dexterous in cunning\npursuits, deceived our largehearted forefathers and stole away all their gold\nand jewels, as thieves do with a passerby on a road. These Bhargavas are\ncheats, vain persons and their persuasions are like herons. A great act had to\nbe done by us and we wanted money at 25 per cent interest with all the\nbecoming humility; yet they did not give us the money; rather seeing on their\nface their clients distressed and sorrowful they spoke that they had no money,\nno money and then they remained silent. True, they got all their money from\nKartavirya; but it may be questioned why they stored it? Why did not they\nperform sacrifices with that? Why did not they give sufficient money to the\nother priests (Yayakas) that did the sacrifices. Never should any Brahmi _n_\nhoard his money; he should give that in charity and enjoy at his pleasure. O\nTwice-born! In amassing wealth, there exist three fears :-- Fear from the\nthieves and robbers, fear from the King, fear from dreadful fire accidents,\nand especially great terrible fear from the cheats. This is the nature of\nwealth; it leaves its preserver. See, moreover, when a hoarder of money dies,\nhe certainly has to quit it. If a wealthy man, before dying, performs\nsacrifices and other good pious acts by his earned money, then he gets\ncertainly good states in future; otherwise, he quits his wealth, to no purpose\nand earns a bad state in his future life; there is no doubt in this. We humbly\nwanted to pay a quarter interest and asked money for the performance of a\ngreat act; yet they, the greedy ones, were doubtful about our promise; and\nthough our priests, they did not give us the money. O Mahar _s_ is! Gift,\nenjoyment and destruction, these are the three courses which any wealth has to\npass through; those persons that have done good deeds, enjoy their wealth and\ngive as charities and thus they make a good and real use of their money; and\nof those that are vicious, their wealth goes away in ruin and to no purpose.\nHe who does not enjoy nor give in charities but is only clever in hoarding and\nwho is a miser, the Kings punish him by all means, that man who cheats himself\nand who suffers only pains and miseries. For that reason, we are now ready to\nkill those Brahmi _n_ s, the vilest of men, the cheats, though they are our\nGurus. O Mahar _s_ is! You are great persons; therefore you do not be angry\nafter you have come to know all these.\n\n\n\n43-51. Vyasa said :-- Thus consoling the Munis, with reasonable words, the\nHaihayas began to roam about, in search of the wives of the\n\n\n\np. 541\n\n\n\nBhargavas. The Bhargava wives were very much distressed with fear and became\nvery lean and thin. They fled away to the Himalayan Mountain weeping, and\ncrying, and trembling with fear. Thus the Bhargavas were being killed by those\nvicious greedy Haihayas, infuriated with anger, and as they liked. O King!\nThis greed is the greatest enemy of a man, residing in his own body; this\ngreed is the root of all evils, of all sins. Life is in danger due to this\ncovetousness. It is due to this greed that quarrels ensue amongst the several\ncastes, the Brahmi _n_ s, etc., and that the human beings are very much\ntroubled with thirst after worldly enjoyments. This greed makes a man forsake\nall his religious rites and long existing customs and observances of his\nfamily; and it is due to this avarice of gold that men kill their fathers,\nmothers, brothers, friends, Gurus, sons, acquaintances, sisters, and sisters-\nin-law and others. Really when a man is bent on avarice, nothing heinous\nremains to him that cannot be done by him. This greed is a more powerful enemy\nthan anger, lust and egoism. O King! Men abandon their lives for their greed;\nwhat more can be said than this? So one should be always alert on this. O\nKing! Your forefathers, the Pa _nd_ avas and Kauravas, were all religious and\nthey followed the path of virtue and goodness. Yet they all were ruined simply\nfor this greed. See! The dreadful fight and separation amongst the relatives\ntook place where there were the high-souled persons like Bhi _s_ ma, Dro _n_\na, Kripacharya, Kar _n_ a, Vahlika, Bhimasena, Yudhi _st_ hira, Arju _n_ a,\nand Kes\xc2\x92ava, only through the avaricious feelings. In this battle Bhi _s_ ma,\nDro _n_ a and the sons of Pa _nd_ avas were all slain; the brothers and\nfathers were all slain in battle. Thus what improper acts and mischiefs can\nthere be that cannot be committed when the human minds are overpowered by this\ngreed? O King! The vicious Haihayas slew the Bhargavas all through this\navarice.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Sixteenth Chapter in the Sixth Book on the incidents preliminary\nto the Haihaya and Bhargava affairs in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 17](bk06ch17.htm)\n\n'
