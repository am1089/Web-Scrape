[1](ry361.htm#fn_831)  \nHis robe, from spot and blemish free  \nLike Amrit foamy from the sea,  [2](ry361.htm#fn_832)  \nHung down in many a loosened fold  \nInwrought with flowers and bright with gold.  \nThe Vanar from his station viewed,  \nAmazed, the wondrous multitude,  \nWhere, in the centre of that ring  \nOf noblest women, stood the king,  \nAs stands the full moon fair to view,  \nGirt by his starry retinue.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[405:1b](ry360.htm#fr_829) The six _Angas_ or subordinate branches of the\nVedas are 1. _Siksh a_, the science of proper articulation and pronunciation:\n2\\. _Chhandas_ ,metre: 3. _Vyakarana_ , linguistic analysis or grammar: 4.\n_Nirukta_ , explanation of difficult Vedic words: 5\\. _Jyotisha_ , Astronomy,\nor rather the Vedic Calendar: 6. _Kalpa_ , ceremonial.\n\n[405:2b](ry360.htm#fr_830) There appears to be some confusion, of time here.\nIt was already morning when Hanuman entered the grove, and the torches would\nbe needless.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XIX.: Sita's Fear.](ry361.htm)\n\n"
