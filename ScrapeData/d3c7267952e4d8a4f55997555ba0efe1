Now, therefore, we will explain the rule of the Ana _s_ natparaya _n_ a\n(recitation of the whole Veda during a fast).\n\n2\\. Let him wear a clean garment or a dress made of bark (or grass). 2\n\n3\\. Let him desire food, fit for a sacrifice, or water and fruit. 3\n\n4\\. Going forth from the village in an easterly or northerly direction,\nsmearing a quadrangular stha _n_ _d_ ila, 'a bull's hide' in size, with\ncowdung, sprinkling it, drawing the marks on it, sprinkling it with water,\nheaping fuel on the fire and scattering (Ku _s_ a grass) around it, he offers\nburnt oblations to the following deities, to Agni Svaha, to Pra _g_ apati 4\n\np. 308\n\n[paragraph continues] Svaha, to Soma Svaha, to all the gods Svaha, to Svaya\n_m_ bhu, to the _Ri_ _k_ as, to the Ya _g_ us, to the Samans, to the\nAtharvans, to faith, to right knowledge, to wisdom, to fortune, to modesty, to\nSavit _ri_ , to the Savitri (verse), to Sadasaspati, and to Anumati.\n\n5\\. Having offered (these oblations), he must begin with the beginning of the\nVeda and continuously recite (it).\n\n6\\. Let him not interrupt (the recitation) by talking, nor by stopping, 6\n\n7\\. Now if he converses in between or stops, let him thrice suppress his\nbreath, and begin just there where he left off.\n\n8\\. If he has forgotten (a passage), he shall recite for as long a time as he\ndoes not recollect it, what (he may know, _Ri_ k-verses) for _Ri_ k-verses,\n(Ya _g_ us-formulas) for Ya _g_ us-formulas, (Samans) for Samans.\n\n9\\. He may (also) recite the Brahma _n_ a of that (forgotten passage) or (the\npassage from the Anukrama _n_ i regarding) its metre and its deities.\n\n10\\. Let him recite the Sa _m_ hita of (his) Veda twelve (times). He thereby\nremoves (faults committed by) studying on forbidden (days, by) angering his\nteacher, (and through) improper acts. His (knowledge of the) Veda is\nsanctified, is purified.\n\n11\\. (If he reads) more than that, a cumulation (of rewards will be the\nresult).\n\n12\\. If he recites the Sa _m_ hita of the Veda another twelve (times), he\ngains thereby the world of U _s_ anas.\n\n13\\. If he recites the Sa _m_ hita of the Veda another\n\np. 309\n\ntwelve (times), he gains thereby the world of B _ri_ haspati.\n\n14\\. If he recites the Sa _m_ hita of the Veda another twelve (times), he\ngains thereby the world of Pra _g_ apati.\n\n15\\. If, fasting, he recites the Sa _m_ hita one thou-sand (times), he becomes\none with Brahman, resplendent like Brahman (and) Brahman (itself).\n\n16\\. If he subsists during a year on food obtained by begging, he gains (the\npower of) supernatural vision.\n\n17\\. If during six months he subsists on barley-gruel, during four months on\nwater and barley-flour, during two months on fruit, (and) during one month on\nwater, or performs K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penances of twelve days, he (obtains the\npower of) suddenly disappearing, and sanctifies seven descendants, seven\nancestors, and himself as the fifteenth, and (any) company (of Brahma _n_ as)\nwhich he may enter.\n\n18\\. They call that the ladder of the gods. 18\n\n19\\. By means of that the gods reached their divine station and the sages the\nposition of _Ri_ shis.\n\n20\\. The periods for beginning this sacrifice, forsooth, are three, the time\nof the morning libation, the time of the midday libation, and the last part of\nthe night, (the Muhurta) sacred to Brahman.\n\n21\\. Pra _g_ apati, forsooth, proclaimed this (rite) to the seven _Ri_ shis,\nthe seven _Ri_ shis to Maha _g_ a _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ u, and Maha _g_ a _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ u to the\nBrahma _n_ as. 21\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[307:2](sbe1481.htm#fr_1386) **9**. M. and the MSS. of the commentary read _k_\niravasa _h_ instead of _k_ iravasa _h_ ,' clad with a garment of bark or\ngrass,' and Govinda explains the var. lect. by 'dressed in old clothes.'\n\n[307:3](sbe1481.htm#fr_1387) This rule refers to the case only where the\nperformer of the vow is unable to bear the prolonged fasting.\n\n[307:4](sbe1481.htm#fr_1388) A stha _n_ _d_ ila is the raised mound, four\nfingers high, which is used as the altar for the G _ri_ hya ceremonies.\nRegarding the term, 'a bull's hide,' see Vish _n_ u XCII, 2. The marks (laksha\n_n_ a) are the lines which must be drawn on the altar; see e.g. \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana\nG _ri_ hya-sutra I, 3, 1.\n\n[308:6](sbe1481.htm#fr_1389) 'By talking, i.e. by uttering words not connected\nwith the Veda.'--Govinda.\n\n[309:18](sbe1481.htm#fr_1390) Govinda explains ni _h_ _s_ re _n_ im, 'the\nladder,' by ni _h_ _s_ reyasahetum, 'a cause of supreme bliss.'\n\n[309:21](sbe1481.htm#fr_1391) The name of the _Ri_ shi who proclaimed it to\nthe Brahmans is not certain. The Dekhan MSS. read Maha _g_ agru and Maha _g_\nagnu, M. Maha _g_ a _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ u, the I. O. copy of the commentary Mahaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\nu and Maha _g_ a _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ u, and the Telugu copy Maha _g_ a _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ u.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na III, Adhyaya 10](sbe1482.htm)\n\n"
