The gods said, \'Here has come into being a divine beast; to\nwhom shall we offer him?\' Now then the earth was small, plants were not born,\nthey offered the barren ewe to the Adityas as desire.\' Then the earth became\nbroad, the plants grew.

Verily he sets gods against gods [6], the sacrifice against the\nsacrifice, speech against speech, the Brahman against the Brahman; verily by\nmeans of the potsherds he makes up the metres, by means of the cakes the\npressings. At the time of the (offering of the) cow, he should offer on one\npotsherd to Mitra and Varuna, this (offering) corresponds to his foe\'s cow\nwhich is to be slaughtered; his (offering) is on one potsherd, for he cannot\nobtain the animal (offering) by means of (many) potsherds.\n\n### ii. 2. 10.\n\nYonder sun did not shine, the gods sought an atonement for him, for him they\noffered this oblation to Soma and Rudra: verily thereby they bestowed\nbrightness upon him.

The sacrificial fee is a\ngarment with a fringe, for the delectation of his fellows. He who desires a\nvillage should offer to the Maruts an oblation of panic seed in the milk of a\nspeckled (cow); from the milk of a speckled (cow) were the Maruts born, of the\nspeckled (cow) panic seed; his fellows have the Maruts for their deity; verily\nhe has recourse to the Maruts with their own share; verily they subject his\nfellows to him; he becomes possessed of a village.

Of the gods the little blood they drew the Raksases\nsmothered by the nights and dawn dawned on them smothered and dead. The gods\nunderstood, \'Him who of us dies, it is the Raksases who kill.\' They invited\nthe Raksases; they said, \'Let us choose a boon; what [1] we win from the\nAsuras, let that be shared between us.\' Then indeed did the gods conquer the\nAsuras, and having conquered the Asuras, they drove away the Raksases. The\nRaksases (saying), \'Ye have done falsely\', surrounded the gods on all sides.\nThe gods found a protector in Agni; they offered to Agni, the forward, a cake\non eight potsherds, to Agni, the overcomer, to Agni with the face. In that\nthey offered to Agni, the forward, the Raksases in front [2] they repelled\nthereby; in that (they offered) to Agni, the overcomer, the Raksases that were\naround they repelled thereby; in that (they offered) to Agni with the face,\nthe Raksases behind were repelled thereby. That the gods prospered, the\nRaksases were defeated. He who has foes should in conflict sacrifice with this\noffering; he should offer to Agni, the forward, a cake on eight potsherds, to\nAgni, the overcomer [3], to Agni with the face. In that he offers to Agni, the\nforward, he repels thereby the foe who is superior to him; in that (he offers)\nto Agni, the overcomer, he repels thereby (the foe) who is equal to him; in\nthat (he offers) to Agni with the face, he repels thereby the foe which is\ninferior to him. He repels the foe who is superior, he surpasses him who is\nlike, the inferior does not equal him who knowing thus sacrifices with this\noffering.\n\n### ii. 4. 2.\n\nThe gods and the Asuras were in conflict; the gods said, \'Let us hold on to\nthe strongest of us\'; they said to Indra, \'Thou art the strongest of us; let\nus hold on to thee.\' He said, \'Three are these forms of my own that have\nstrength; satiate them, and then shall ye overcome the Asuras.\' They said,\n\'Name (them).\' He said, \'This is that which frees from tribulation; this is\nthat which drives away the foe; this is that which has power\' [1]. They\noffered to Indra, the freer from tribulation, a cake on eleven potsherds, to\nIndra, the driver away of the foe, to Indra, the powerful. In that they\noffered to Indra, the freer from tribulation, thereby they were freed from\ntribulation; in that they offered to Indra, the driver away of foes, thereby\nthey drove away foes; in that they offered to Indra, the powerful, thereby\nthey bestowed power upon themselves. They offered a cake on thirty-three\npotsherds; the gods are thirty-three; verily Indra takes hold of them in\nhimself, for prosperity [2]. That was the highest victory that the gods won\nover the Asuras. He who has foes should in conflict sacrifice with this\noffering; to Indra, the freer from tribulation, he should offer a cake on\neleven potsherds, to Indra, the driver away of the foe, to Indra, the\npowerful; by tribulation is he seized whose foe is superior to him; in that he\noffers to Indra, the freer from tribulation, he is freed thereby from\ntribulation; by foes is he beset, to whom one of his equals is superior, even\n[3] if no foe; in that (he offers) to Indra, the driver away of the foe, he\nsmites away thereby his foes; in that (he offers) to Indra, the powerful, he\nbestows thereby power upon himself; he offers a cake on thirty-three\npotsherds; the gods are thirty-three; verily the sacrificer takes hold of them\nin himself, for prosperity, Thus is the sacrifice called \'the victorious\'; he\nwho knowing thus sacrifices with this offering wins thus the highest victory\nover his foe.\n\n### ii. 4. 3.\n\nThe gods and the Asuras were in conflict; the Gayatri, grasping and taking\ntheir force, might, power, strength, offspring, and cattle, remained away;\nthey reflected, I Whomsoever of us she shall resort to, they shall become this\n(world)\'; they hailed her in rivalry, \'O All worker\', said the gods; \'O\nDeceiver\', said the Asuras; neither did she resort to. The gods saw this\nformula, \'Thou art force, thou art strength, thou art might [1], thou are\nblazing, thou art by name the home of the gods, thou art all, of all life thou\nart everything, thou art of every life, the overcoming.\' (So saying) the gods\nappropriated the force, might, power, strength, offspring, and cattle of the\nAsuras. Because the Gayatri remained away, therefore they style this offering\nthe Gayatri; the Gayatri is the year, so the year remained away; because the\ngods thereby appropriated the force, might, power, strength [2], offspring,\nand cattle of the Asuras, therefore they style this offering the gatherer. He\nwho has foes should in conflict sacrifice with this offering. To Agni, the\ngatherer, he should offer a cake on eight potsherds; this when cooked and put\nin place he should stroke with this formula; verily he appropriates the force,\nmight, power, strength, offspring, and cattle of his foe; he prospers with\nhimself, his foe is defeated.\n\n### ii. 4. 4.\n\nPrajapati created offspring; they created went away from him; where they\nstayed, thence sprung the bean. Those he followed with Brhaspati; Brhaspati\nsaid, \'With this will I go before thee, then shall offspring have resort to\nthee.\' He went before him; then indeed did offspring resort to Prajapati. For\nhim who desires offspring he should offer this oblation of beans to Prajapati\nverily he has recourse to Prajapati with his own share [1]; verily he produces\noffspring for him. Prajapati created cattle; they created went away from him;\nwhere they stayed, thence sprung the bean; those he followed with Pusan; Pusan\nsaid, \'With this do thou go before me; then shall cattle resort to thee.\' \'Do\nthou go before me\', said Soma, \'mine [2] is what grows on untilled (land).\'\n\'Both of you shall I go before\', he said; he went before them both; then\nindeed did cattle resort to Prajapati. For him who desires cattle should he\noffer this oblation of beans to Soma and Pusan; verily he has recourse to Soma\nand Pusan with their own share; verily they produce cattle for him. Soma is\nthe impregnator of seed, Pusan the producer of cattle; verily Soma bestows\nseed upon him, Pusan produces cattle.\n\n### ii. 4. 5.\n\na O Agni come to us with kine;  \nO drop, delight us with increase;  \nIndra is the supporter in our homes.  \nb Savitr, the thousandfold,  \nMay he delight us in our homes;  \nMay Pusan come, may wealth (be ours).  \nc May Dhatr give us wealth,  \nThe lord, the ruler of the world;  \nMay he favour us with a full (gift).  \nd Tvastr the bull, the strong,  \nMay he delight us in our homes,  \nWith a thousand, with ten thousand.  \ne Thou whereby the gods moved immortality [1],  \nEnduring fame, in the sky,  \nO increase of wealth, vouchsafe us  \nA herd of kine for life.  \nf Agni, lord of the house, Soma, all-winning, Savitr the wise; hail!  \ng O Agni, lord of the house, with thy ghee portion do thou vouchsafe strength\nand force to him who advanceth; may I not wander from the highest of the path;\nmay I become the head; hail!\n\n### ii. 4. 6.\n\nHe who desires cattle should sacrifice with the \xc3\x87itra (offering); \xc3\x87itra is\nthis (earth); in that in this (earth) all things are produced, thereby is this\n(earth) variegated ( _citra_ ); he who knowing thus sacrifices with the \xc3\x87itra\ndesirous of cattle is propagated with offspring, with cattle, with pairings.\nWith the offering to Agni he strews, with that to Soma he impregnates seed,\nthe seed impregnated Tvastr develops into forms; there are (offerings) to\nSarasvant and Sarasvati; that is the divine pair; verily in the midst he\nbestows upon him a divine [1] pair, for growth, for propagation. There is an\noblation to Sinivali; Sinivali is speech, speech is growth; verily he\napproaches speech and growth. The last is to Indra, and thereby there is a\npair. Seven are these offerings, the tame animals are seven, the wild seven;\nthe metres are seven, for the winning of both. Then he offers these oblations;\nthese gods are the lords of growth; verily they bestow growth upon him, he\ngrows with offspring and cattle; moreover in that he offers these oblations,\n(they serve) for support.\n\n### ii. 4. 7.\n\na Thou I art connected with the Maruts, thou art the force of the Maruts,\ncleave the stream of the waters.  \nb Stay, O Maruts, the speeding falcon,  \nSwift as mind, the strong, the glorious;  \nThat whereby the dread host goeth set loose,  \nDo ye, O A\xc3\xa7vins, put around; hail!  \nc East wind, raining, quicken; Ravat!

He makes offering to the\nnames of the wind; the wind rules the rain; verily he has recourse to the wind\nwith its own share; verily it makes Parjanya rain for him. Eight offerings [1]\nhe makes; the quarters are four, the intermediate quarters are four; verily\nfrom the quarters he makes the rain to move. He unites (them) on a black\nantelope skin; verily he makes the offering; he unites within the Vedi, for\naccomplishment. When the Yatis were being eaten, their heads fell away; they\nbecame Kharjuras; their sap rose upwards, they became Kariras; the Kariras are\nconnected with Soma; the offering connected with Soma makes rain to move from\nthe sky; in that there are Kariras (in the sacrifice) [2], by means of an\noffering which is connected with Soma he wins the rain from the sky. With\nhoney he unites (them); honey is the sap of the waters and the plants; verily\nit rains from the waters and the plants; verily also he brings down rain from\nthe waters and the plants. \'Gladdening, obedient\', (with these words) he\nunites (them); verily he approaches them by their names; just as one may say,\n\'Come hither, N. N.\', so by their names [3] he makes them move forward. Thou\nart the fetter of the strong horse; for rain I yoke thee\', he says the horse\nis strong, Parjanya is strong; becoming black as it were he rains; verily he\nunites him with his hue, to win the rains.\n\n### ii. 4. 10.\n\n\'O gods having wealth, O gods granting protection, O gods drinking together\',\n(with these words) he ties on; verily by means of the gods he daily seeks\nrain. If it should rain, so much only should be offered; if it should not\nrain, on the next day he should offer an oblation. Mitra and Varuna are day\nand night, by day and night Parjanya rains, for by night or by day he rains;\nverily he has recourse to Mitra and Varuna with their own share; verily they\n[1] make Parjanya rain for him by day and night. To Agni, hiding his abode, he\nshould offer a cake on eight potsherds, to the Maruts on seven potsherds, to\nSurya on one potsherd; Agni thence causes the rain to arise, the Maruts lead\nit out when produced; when yonder Sun Moves low with his rays, then he rains;\nbecoming a hider of his abode, as it were, he rains; these deities are the\nlords of rain; them he has recourse to with their own share; they [2] make\nParjanya rain for him; even if he is not minded to rain yet he rains. \'Let\nfree the rain from heaven; with waters fill the ocean\', he says; verily these\nand yonder waters he unites; then with these he approaches yonder (waters).\n\'Thou art born of waters, first-born; thou art the might of the ocean\', he\nsays; that is according to the text. \'Flood the earth\', (with these words) he\noffers in a _Boerhavia procumbens_ ; this of plants is that which wins rain,\nand thereby he causes rain to fall. \'The gods whose portion is in the sky\',\n(with these words) he shakes the black antelope skin; verily to him these\nworlds become dear and desired.\n\n### ii. 4. 11.\n\n\'All\' the metres are to be recited in this sacrifice\', they say; the Kakubh is\nthe strength of the Tristubh, the Usnih of the Jagati; in that he repeats the\nUsnih and the Kakubh, thereby he wins all the metres. The Usnih is the\nGayatri; the four syllables over are fourfooted cattle; just as cake is over\ncake, so it is with the syllables which are over the verse; if he were to\nclose with a Jagati [1], he would end the sacrifice; he closes with a\nTristubh, the Tristubh is power and strength; verily he establishes the\nsacrifice on power and strength, he does not end it. \'O Agni, three are thy\nstrengths, three thy abodes\', with this (verse) containing the word \'three\' he\ncloses, for similarity of form: that which has three constituents is the whole\nof the sacrifice; for every desire it is employed, for the sacrifice is\nemployed for all desires. He who is practising witchcraft should sacrifice\nwith that of three constituents; that which has three constituents is the\nwhole of the sacrifice [2]; verily with the whole of the sacrifice he\nbewitches him, and lays him low. With the same (offering) should he sacrifice\nwho is practised against, that which has three constituents is the whole of\nthe sacrifice; verily he sacrifices with the whole of the sacrifice, and he\nwho practises witchcraft does not lay him low. With the same (offering) should\nhe sacrifice who is going to sacrifice with a thousand; verily he produces and\ngives (it). He who has sacrificed with a thousand should sacrifice with the\nsame (offering) he goes to the end of cattle [3] who sacrifices with a\nthousand; Prajapati created cattle; he created them with (the offering) of\nthree constituents; he who knowing thus sacrifices, desirous of cattle, with\n(the offering) of three constituents, creates cattle from the very source\nwhence Prajapati created them; and the thousand resorts to him. He becomes a\nprey to the gods who having said, \'I shall sacrifice\', does not sacrifice; he\nshould sacrifice with (the offering) of three constituents; (the offering) of\nthree constituents [4] is the whole of the sacrifice; verily he sacrifices\nwith the whole of the sacrifice, and does not become a prey to the gods. The\ncake is on twelve potsherds; these are three (sets of) four potsherds, to\nbring about the three. There are three cakes, these worlds are three; (verily\nthey serve) to win these worlds. Each one above the other is larger, for so as\nit were are these worlds. The middle one is made of barley, that is the form\nof the atmosphere; (verily it serves) for prosperity. He cuts off from all\n(the cakes) as he sets them up without making a failure. He gives gold; verily\nhe wins brilliance [5]; he gives the silken garment; verily he wins cattle; he\ngives a cow; verily he wins his prayers; gold is the colour of the Saman, the\nsilken garment of the formulae, the cow of the praises and rejoicings; verily\nhe wins all these colours.\n\n### ii. 4. 12.\n\nTvastr, his son slain, offered Soma excluding Indra. Indra desired an\ninvitation to the rite, but he did not invite him, (saying), \'Thou hast slain\nmy son.\' He made a disturbance of the sacrifice, and forcibly drank the Soma.\nThe remains of it Tvastr cast upon the Ahavaniya (fire), saying, \'Hail! wax\ngreat, Indra\'s foe. While (the fire) was flaming upwards to strike, just then\nof itself it stayed; whether so much was before [1], or so much was over the\nfire, be sprang up alive and came into union with Agni and Soma. He grew on\nall sides an arrow(shot), he enveloped these worlds. Because he enveloped\nthese worlds, therefore is Vrtra, Vrtra. Indra feared him, and Tvastr too;\nTvastr dipped his bolt for him; the bolt was fervour; he could not restrain\nit. Visnu [2] was another god; he said, \'Visnu, come hither; we will grasp\nthat by which he is this world. Visnu deposited himself in three places, a\nthird on the earth, a third in the atmosphere, a third in the sky, for he was\nafraid of his growth. By means of the third on earth Indra raised his bolt,\naided by Visnu. He said, \'Hurl it not at me; there is this [3] strength in me;\nI will give it to you.\' He gave it to him, he accepted it, and (saying), \'Thou\ndidst further me\', gave it to Visnu. Visnu accepted it (saying), \'Let Indra\nplace power ( _indriya_ ) in us.\' By means of the third in the atmosphere\nIndra raised his bolt, aided by Visnu. He said, \'Hurl it not at me; there is\nthis [4] strength in me; I will give it to you.\' He gave it to him; he\naccepted it, and (saying), \'Twice hast thou furthered me\', gave it to Visnu.\nVisnu accepted it (saying), \'Let Indra place power in us.\' By means of the\nthird in the sky Indra raised his bolt, aided by Visnu. He said, \'Hurl it not\nat me; I will give to thee that by which I [5] am this world! He said, \'Yes.\'\n(He replied), \'Let us make a compact; let me enter thee.\' \'If thou dost enter\nme, in what way wilt thou enjoy me?\' \'I will kindle thee; I will enter thee\nfor thine enjoyment\', he answered. Vrtra entered him. Vrtra is the belly;\nhunger is man\'s enemy; he who [6] knows this slays the enemy hunger. He gave\nit to him; he accepted it, and (saying), \'Thrice hast thou furthered me\', gave\nit to Visnu. Visnu accepted it (saying), \'Let Indra place power in us.\' In\nthat thrice he gave and thrice he accepted, that is the reason of the\nthreefold character of the threefold. In that Visnu aided him and he gave (it)\nto Visnu, therefore the offering belongs to Indra and Visnu. Whatever there is\nhere he gave to him, the Rces, the Samans, the Yajuses. A thousand he gave to\nhim; therefore there are a thousand gifts.\n\n### ii. 4. 13.\n\nThe gods were afraid of the warrior on his birth. While still within (the\nwomb) they fettered him with a bond. The warrior thus is born fettered; if he\nwere born not fettered he would continually slay his foes. If one desire of a\nwarrior, \'May he be born not fettered, may he continually slay his foes\', one\nshould offer for him the offering for Indra and Brhaspati, for the warrior is\nconnected with Indra, Brhaspati is the holy power (Brahman); verily by the\nholy power (Brahman) he frees him from the bond that fetters him. The\nsacrificial present is a golden bond; verily manifestly he frees him from the\nbond that fetters him.\n\n### ii. 4. 14.\n\na He is born ever new;  \nThe banner of the days goeth before the dawns.  \nHe appointeth their portion to the gods as he advanceth  \nThe moon extendeth length of days.  \nb The drop which the Adityas make to swell,  \nThe imperishable which the imperishable drink,  \nWith that may king Varuna, Brhaspati,  \nThe guardians of the world make us to swell.  \nc In the eastern quarter thou art king, O Indra  \nIn the northern, O slayer of Vrtra, thou art slayer of foes  \nWhere the streams [1] go, thou hast conquered;  \nOn the south be the bull whom we invoke.  \nd Indra shall conquer, he shall not be conquered;  \nOver-lord among kings shall he rule;  \nIn all conflicts shall he be a protector,  \nThat he may be reverenced and honoured.  \ne His greatness surpasseth  \nSky or earth or heaven;  \nIndra sole lord, hailed by all, in his home  \nBoisterous and brave, waxeth great for the conflict.  \nf We call on thee, O hero, in praise,  \nLike kine unmilked,  \nLord [2] of this moving world, seeing the heavenly light,  \nLord, O Indra, of what standeth.  \ng We call on thee,  \nWe poets, to gain the prize;  \nMen call on thee, lord of heroes, O Indra, amongst foes,  \nOn thee in the racing of the horse.  \nh If, O Indra, a hundred skies,  \nA hundred earths were thine,  \nNot a thousand suns could match thee at birth,  \nNor the two worlds.  \ni Drink the Soma, O Indra; let it gladden thee,  \n(The Soma) which for thee, O lord of bays, the stone  \nThrough the arms of the presser [3], like a horse well guided hath expressed.  \nk With Indra may splendid feasts be ours,  \nRich in strength,  \nWherewith we may rejoice in food.  \nl O Agni, thy pure.  \nm With the light.  \nn Thee, Jatavedas.  \no Seven bays in thy chariot  \nBear thee, O god Surya,  \nWith hair of light, O wise one.  \np The radiant countenance of the gods hath arisen,  \nThe eye of Mitra, Varuna, and Agni;  \nHe hath filled the sky, the earth, and the atmosphere;  \nSurya is the soul of that which moveth and standeth [4].  \nq May the All-gods who further right,  \nWho hearken to the call in due season,  \nFind pleasure in this proper drink.  \nr O ye All-gods, hear my invocation,  \nYe that are in the atmosphere, ye that are in the sky;  \nYe with Agni as your tongue, worthy of sacrifice,  \nSit on this strew and rejoice.\n\n## PRAPATHAKA V\n\n_\n\nThe New and Full Moon Sacrifices\n\n_\n\nii. 5. 1.\n\na Vi\xc3\xa7varupa, son of Tvastr, was the domestic priest of the gods, and the\nsister\'s son of the Asuras. He had three heads, one which drank Soma, one\nSura, and one which ate food. He promised openly the share to the gods,\nsecretly to the Asuras. Men promise openly the share to every one; if they\npromise any one secretly, his share is indeed promised. Therefore Indra was\nafraid (thinking), \'Such an one is diverting the sovereignty (from me).\' He\ntook his bolt and smote off his heads. (The head) which drank Soma [1] became\na hazelcock; (the head) which drank Sura a sparrow; (the head) which ate food\na partridge. He seized with his hand the guilt of slaying him, and bore it for\na year. Creatures called out upon him, \'Thou art a Brahman slayer.\' He\nappealed to the earth, \'Take a third part of my guilt.\' She said, \'Let me\nchoose a boon. I deem that I shall be overcome through digging. Let me not be\novercome by that.\' He replied, \'Before [2] a year is out it will grow up for\nthee.\' Therefore before the year is out the dug-out portion of earth grows up\nagain, for that was what she chose as a boon. She took a third of his guilt.\nThat became a natural fissure; therefore one who has piled up a fire-altar and\nwhose deity is faith should not choose a natural fissure, for that is the\ncolour of guilt. He appealed to the trees, \'Take a third part of my guilt.\'\nThey said, \'Let us choose a boon. We deem that we shall be overcome through\npruning [3]. Let us not be overcome by that.\' He replied, \'From pruning shall\nmore (shoots) spring up for you.\' Therefore from the pruning of trees more\n(shoots) spring up, for that was what they chose as a boon. They took a third\npart of his guilt, it became sap; therefore one should not partake of sap, for\nit is the colour of guilt. Or rather of the sap which is red or which comes\nfrom the pruning one should not partake [4], but of other sap at will. He\nappealed to a concourse of women, \'Take the third of my guilt.\' They said,\n\'Let us choose a boon; let us obtain offspring from after the menses; let us\nenjoy intercourse at will up to birth.\' Therefore women obtain offspring from\nafter the menses, and enjoy intercourse at will up to birth, for that was what\nthey chose as a boon. They took a third of his guilt, it became (a woman) with\nstained garments; therefore one should not converse with (a woman) with\nstained garments [5], one should not sit with her, nor eat her food, for she\nkeeps emitting the colour of guilt. Or rather they say, \'Woman\'s food is\nunguent, and there fore one should not accept (from her) unguent, but anything\nelse (can be accepted) at will.\' The son born of intercourse with (a woman)\nwith stained garments is accursed; (the son born) of intercourse in the forest\nis a thief; (the son born) of intercourse with a (woman) who turns away is\nshamefaced and retiring; (the son born) of intercourse with a woman bathing is\nfated to drown; (the son born) of one who [6] anoints herself has a skin\ndisease; (the son born) of one who combs her hair is bald and feeble; (the son\nborn) of one who anoints (her eyes) is blind; (the son born) of one who cleans\nher teeth has dirty teeth; (the son born) of one who cuts her nails has bad\nnails; (the son born) of one who spins is a eunuch; (the son born) of one who\nweaves ropes is unrestrained; (the son born) of one who drinks from a leaf is\ndrunken; (the son born) of one who drinks from a mutilated (vessel) is\nmutilated. For three nights he should keep a vow and should drink from his\nhand or from a perfect vessel, to guard his offspring.\n\n### ii. 5. 2.\n\nTvastr, his son being slain, offered Soma excluding Indra. Indra desired an\ninvitation to the rite, but he did not invite him; (saying) \'Thou hast slain\nmy son.\' He made a disturbance of the sacrifice, and forcibly drank the Soma.\nThe remains of it Tvastr cast upon the Ahavaniya (fire), (saying), \'Hail! wax\ngreat, Indra\'s foe.\' In that he cast it ( _avartayat_ ), Vrtra is Vrtra; in\nthat he said, \'Hail! wax great, Indra\'s foe\', therefore [1] Indra became his\nfoe. He sprang into life and came into union with Agni and Soma. He grew on\nall sides an arrow(shot), he enveloped these worlds. Because he enveloped\nthese worlds, therefore is Vrtra, Vrtra. Indra feared him. He ran up to\nPrajapati, (saying), \'A foe has sprung up for me.\' He dipped his bolt and gave\nit to him, (saying), \'Slay with it.\' He went against (him) with it. Agni and\nSoma said, \'Hurl it not [2]; we are within.\' \'Ye are mine\', he replied, \'come\nto me.\' They asked for a share; he gave them at the full moon this offering\nfor Agni and Soma on eleven potsherds. They said, \'We are bitten all round,\nand cannot come.\' Indra produced from himself cold and fever heat; that was\nthe origin of cold and fever heat. Him who knows thus the origin of cold and\nfever heat [3] neither cold nor fever heat slays. By them he led him on, and\nas he gaped Agni and Soma went forth from him. Then expiration and inspiration\ndeserted him; skill is expiration, intelligence is inspiration; therefore one\nwho gapes should say, \'Skill and intelligence (remain) in me\'; verily he\nplaces expiration and inspiration in himself and lives all his days. He,\nhaving called off the gods from. Vrtra offered at the full moon the oblation\nto the Vrtra slayer; they slay him at the full moon [4], but make him swell at\nthe new moon; therefore verses are uttered at the full moon referring to the\nslaying of Vrtra, at the new moon referring to his increase. Having performed\nthe oblation to the Vrtra slayer, he took his bolt and again went against\n(him). Sky and earth said, \'Hurl it not; he rests in us two.\' They said, \'Let\nus choose a boon.\' \'May I be adorned with the Naksatras\', said yonder (sky); I\nMay I be adorned with variegated things\', said this (earth). Therefore yonder\n(sky) is adorned with the Naksatras, this (earth) with variegated things. He\nwho knows thus the boon of sky and earth [5] attains a boon. Indra thus\nimpelled by these two slew Vrtra. The gods having slain Vrtra said to Agni and\nSoma, \'Bear the offering for us.\' They said, \'We two have lost our brilliance,\nour brilliance is in Vrtra.\' They said, \'Who is there to go for it?\' \'The\ncow\', they said, \'The cow is the friend of all.\' She said [6], \'Let me choose\na boon; ye shall feed off both when they are in me.\' The cow brought the\n(brilliance); therefore they feed off both things that are in the cow; ghee\nindeed is the brilliance of Agni, milk the brilliance of Soma. He who knows\nthus the brilliance of Agni and Soma becomes brilliant. The theologians say,\n\'What is the deity of the full moon (rite)?\' He should reply, \'Prajapati; by\nmeans of it he established his eldest son, Indra.\' Therefore they establish\ntheir eldest sons with wealth.\n\n### ii. 5. 3.\n\nWhen Indra had slain Vrtra, his enemies threatened him. He saw this enemy-\ndispelling (oblation) to be offered subsequently at the full moon. He offered\nit, and with it drove away his enemies. In that the enemy-dispelling\n(oblation) is to be offered subsequently at the full moon, the sacrificer by\nit drives away his enemies. Indra, having slain Vrtra, lost the gods and his\npower. He saw the (offering) to Agni on eight potsherds at the new moon, and\nthe curds for Indra [1]. He offered it, and by it he won the gods and his\npower. In that at the new moon there is (an offering) to Agni on eight\npotsherds, and curds for Indra, the sacrificer wins by it the gods and power.\nWhen Indra had slain Vrtra, his power and strength went into the earth; then\nthe plants and roots were born. He ran up to Prajapati, (saying), \'Now that I\nhave slain Vrtra, my power and strength [2] have gone into the earth; then the\nplants and roots have been born.\' Prajapati said to cattle, \'Collect it for\nhim.\' The cattle collected it from the plants in themselves; they milked it.\nIn that they collected it, has the collected oblation ( _sammayya_ ) its name;\nin that they milked it, has fresh milk its name ( _pratidhuk_ ). \'They have\ncollected it; they have milked it; but it rests not in me\', he said. \'Make it\nready for him\' [3], he replied. They made it ready for him; they made power\nand strength rest in him; verily the ready (milk) has its name ( _\xc3\xa7 rta_).\n\'They have collected it; they have milked it; they have made it ready; but it\ndoes not impel me\', he said. \'Make it curds for him\', he replied. They made it\ncurds for him; that impelled ( _ahinot_ ) him; verily curds ( _dadhi_ ) has\nits name. The theologians say, \'One should offer curds first, for curds is\nmade first\' [4]. One should disregard that and offer ready (milk) first;\nverily one places power and strength in him and later impels him by curds; and\nhe proceeds in order (of production). If he curdles it with Putika plants or\nwith bark, that is fit for Soma; if with jujubes, that is for the Raksases; if\nwith rice grains, for the All-gods; if with rennet, for men; if with curds,\nthat has Indra. He curdles it with curds [5] that it may have Indra. He\ncurdles the remains of the Agnihotra, for the continuity of the sacrifice.\nIndra having slain Vrtra went to a great distance, thinking, \'I have sinned.\'\nThe gods sought to start him. Prajapati said, I He who first finds him will\nhave the first share.\' The Pitrs found him; therefore an offering is made to\nthe Pitrs on the day before. He approached the new moon night; the gods met\nhim, (saying), \'Our treasure to-day at home [6] dwells\', for Indra is the\ntreasure of the gods, and that is why the new moon night has its name ( _ama-\nvasya_ ), \'home dwelling\'). The theologians say, What is the deity of the\nSamnayya?\' \'The All-gods\', he should reply, for so the All-gods won that as\ntheir share.\' Or rather he should reply, \'Indra, for it was in healing Indra\nthat they won it.\'\n\nii. 5. 4. The theologians say, \'He would indeed offer the new and full moon\n(sacrifices) who should offer them with Indra.\' At the full moon there is the\nsubsequent offering of the enemy-dispelling (oblation), and by it the full\nmoon has Indra. There are curds for Indra at the new moon; verily the new moon\nhas Indra. He who knowing thus offers,\' the new and full moon sacrifices,\noffers them with Indra, and day after day it becomes better for him who has so\nsacrificed. What the gods did at the sacrifice, the Asuras did. The gods [1]\nsaw this offering, one on eleven potsherds for Agni and Visnu, an oblation for\nSarasvati, an oblation for Sarasvant; after performing the full moon\n(sacrifice) they offered this. Then the gods prospered, the Asuras were\ndefeated. He who has enemies should offer this offering after performing the\nfull moon (sacrifice). With the full moon (sacrifice) he hurls the bolt at his\nenemy, with (the offering) to Agni and Visnu he appropriates the gods and the\nsacrifice of his enemy, his pairing cattle with (the offerings) to Sarasvati\nand Sarasvant. Whatever he has, all that [2] he appropriates. One should\nsacrifice at the full moon, if one has enemies, not at the new moon; having\nslain one\'s enemy one does not cause him to grow again. He who desires cattle\nshould sacrifice with the Sakamprasthayiya. The man to whom they bring (any\nthing) in small measure is not himself pleased, and does not give to another.\nBut he, to whom they bring in large measure, is himself pleased, and gives to\nanother. One should offer in full and large measure; Indra then being pleased\ndelights him with offspring and cattle. He offers with a wooden vessel, for an\nearthenware one does not hold the offering. It is of Udumbara wood [3]; the\nUdumbara is strength, cattle are strength; verily by strength he wins for him\nstrength and cattle. One should not sacrifice to, Mahendra, if one is not\nprosperous. The prosperous are three; a learned (Brahman), a village headman,\nand a warrior. Their deity is Mahendra. He who sacrifices beyond his own deity\nloses his own deity, and does not obtain another, and becomes worse. For a\nyear one should sacrifice to Indra, for the vow extends not beyond the year;\nverily [4] his own deity, being sacrificed to, kindles him with prosperity and\nhe becomes richer. After the year he should offer a cake on eight potsherds to\nAgni, lord of vows; verily for a year Agni, lord of vows, causes him to take\nup the vow who has slain his foe ( _vrtra_ ). Thereafter he may sacrifice at\nwill.\n\n### ii. 5. 5.\n\nNo one who is not a Soma sacrificer should offer the Samnayya. For the milk of\nhim who is not a Soma sacrificer is imperfect, and if one who is not a Soma\nsacrificer offers the Samnayya he is a thief and does wrong, and (his milk) is\npoured forth in vain. A Soma sacrificer only should offer the Samnayya. Soma\nis milk, the Samnayya is milk; verily with milk he places milk in himself. The\nmoon deprives him of offspring and cattle, and makes his enemy wax great on\nwhose sacrifice when offered it rises in the east [1]. He should divide the\nrice grains into three parts; the mean size he should make into a cake on\neight potsherds for Agni, the giver, the largest lie should give as a mess to\nIndra, the bestower, the smallest (he should give) as a mess in boiled (milk)\nto Visnu \xc3\x87ipivista. Agni thus generates offspring for him; Indra gives it in\ncrease; Visnu is the sacrifice, and \xc3\x87ipi cattle; verily on the sacrifice and\ncattle he rests. He should not offer twice [2]. If he were to offer now with\nthe first he would make a failure with the second; if with the second now, he\nwould make a failure with the first; there is no offering at all and no\nsacrifice, for that cause a son is born shamefaced and retiring. One offering\nonly should one make; a valiant son is born to him. One should disregard this\nand offer twice. With the first (offering) one grasps the mouth of the\nsacrifice, and sacrifices with the second. Verily one wins the gods with the\nfirst, power with the second; verily one conquers the world of the gods [3]\nwith the first; the world of men with the second; he performs several forms of\nsacrifice. This offering is called \'the friendly\'; for him there is in this\nworld prosperity on whom the moon rises in the west after he hag sacrificed on\nthat day. He who desires heaven should sacrifice with the Daksayana sacrifice.\nOn the full moon he should offer the Samnayya; on the new moon he should\nsacrifice with clotted curds for Mitra and Varuna. On the full moon (the Soma)\nis pressed for the gods; during this half-month it is pressed forth for them,\nand a cow for Mitra and Varuna is to be slaughtered for them at the new moon.\nIn that [4] he sacrifices on the day before, he makes the sacrificial\nenclosure. In that he drives away the calves, he metes out the seat and the\noblation holder. In that he sacrifices, he produces with the gods the pressing\nday. He drinks for the half-month Soma in carouse with the gods. In that he\nsacrifices at the new moon with clotted curds for Mitra and Varuna, the cow\nwhich is slaughtered for the gods becomes his also. He mounts upon the gods in\ntruth who mounts upon their sacrifice [5]. Just as a great man who has\nattained (fortune) desires (and does), so he does. If he misses the mark he\nbecomes worse; if he does not, he remains the same. One who desires\ndistinction should sacrifice with it, for this sacrifice has a razor edge, and\nswiftly he becomes holy or perishes. His vow is: he shall not speak untruth;\nbe shall not eat meat; he shall not approach for all a woman; they shall not\nclean his raiment with cleansing stuff; for all these things the gods do not\ndo.\n\n### ii. 5. 6.\n\nThe new and the full moon (sacrifices) are the chariot of the gods. He, who\nhaving offered the new and the full moon (sacrifices) Sacrifices with Soma,\nrests in the chosen resting-place of the gods which is conspicuous for its\nchariot (tracks). The new and the full moons are the limbs and joints of the\nyear; he who knowing thus offers the new and the full moon (sacrifices) thus\nunites the limbs and joints of the year. The new and the full moon are the\neyes of the year; he who knowing thus offers the new and the full moon\n(sacrifices) thus sees with them along the world of heaven [1]. The new and\nthe full moon are the striding of the gods; he who knowing thus offers the new\nand the full moon (sacrifices) steps in the striding of the gods. The new and\nthe full moon are the path on which the gods fare; he who knowing thus offers\nthe new and the full moon (sacrifices) mounts the path on which the gods fare.\nThe new and the full moons are the bay steeds of the gods; he who knowing thus\noffers the new and the full moon (sacrifices) carries to the gods with their\ntwo bay steeds [2] the offering. The new and the full moon (sacrifices) are\nthe mouth of the gods; he who knowing thus offers the new and the full moon\n(sacrifices) manifestly sacrifices in the mouth of the gods. He who offers the\nnew and the full moon sacrifices possesses an oblation holder. He offers the\nAgnihotra morn and evening, he offers the new and the full moon (sacrifices);\non every day (the Soma) of those who have oblation holders is pressed. By him\nwho knowing thus offers the new and the full moon (sacrifices) regarding\nhimself as possessiug an oblation holder, everything is given as on the strew.\nThe gods [3] could not find the suitable day for the sacrifice. They purified\nthe new and full moons; the new and the full moon (sacrifices) are these pure\nand sacrificial (days). He who knowing thus offers the new and the full moon\n(sacrifices) offers them as pure and sacrificial. One should not approach a\nwoman on the new moon or the full moon night; if one were to do so, one would\nbe impotent. The nights of the half-month were the wives of King Soma; of\nthese be did not approach the new moon night and the full moon night [4]. They\ngrasped him about, and illness seized him. \'Illness has seized the king\'; that\n(saying) is the origin of the \'king\'s evil \'. In that he became worse, that is\n(the origin) of the \'bad illness\'; because he got it from his wives, that is\n(the origin) of the \'wife\'s disease\' (Jayenya), him who knows thus the origin\nof these illnesses, these illnesses do not visit. He ran up to these two in\nreverence; they said, \'Let us choose a boon; let us be the appointers of\nportions for the gods [5]; from us let the gods be sacrificed to.\' Therefore\nof the series of nights it is on the new and the full moon night that the gods\nare sacrificed to; for they are the appointers of portions for the gods. Men\nappoint portions to him who knows thus. Creatures slew hunger, man at once,\nthe gods at the half-month, the Pitrs in a month, trees in a year. Therefore\nday by day men desire food, at the half-month the gods are sacrificed to,\nevery month offering is made to the Pitrs, in a year trees produce fruit. He\nwho knows thus slays the enemy, hunger.\n\n_\n\nThe Part of the Hotr at the New and Full Moon Sacrifices\n\n_\n\n### ii. 5. 7.\n\nThe gods could not rest on the Rc or the Yajus. On the Saman only could they\nrest. He makes the noise \'Him\'; verily he makes the Saman. He makes the noise\n\'Him\'; where the gods rested, there he sets them in motion. He makes the noise\n\'Him\'; this is the yoking of speech. He makes the noise \'Him\'; thus the\nsacrificers produce offspring. He repeats the first (verse) thrice, the last\nthrice; verily he ties the end of the sacrifice [1] so that it may not slip.\nHe repeats (it) continuously, for the continuity of the breaths and of food,\nand for the smiting away of the Raksases. The first he repeats is connected\nwith the Rathantara (Saman), this world is connected with the Rathantara;\nverily he conquers this world. He divides it thrice; these worlds are three;\nverily he conquers these worlds. The last he repeats is connected with the\nBrhat (Saman); yonder world is connected with the Brhat; verily he conquers\nyonder world. \'Forward [2] your viands\', he repeats, a verse which has not any\nindication (of its deity) and (therefore) is addressed to Prajapati. Prajapati\nis the sacrifice; verily he grasps the sacrifice as Prajapati. \'Forward your\nviands\', he repeats; viands are food; verily he wins food. \'Forward your\nviands\', he repeats; therefore seed is deposited in front. \'O Agni, come\nhither for the feast\', he repeats; therefore offspring are born at the back.\n\'Forward your viands\', he repeats [3]; \'viands\' are the months, \'heavenwards\'\nare the half-months, \'rich in the oblation\' are the gods, \'full of butter\' is\nthe cow, \'he goes to the gods\' (that is) the sacrifice, \'desirous of favour \'\nis the sacrificer. \'Thou art this, thou art this\', (with these words) he wins\nthe dear abode of the sacrifice. If he desire for a man, \'May he live all his\ndays\', he should repeat for him \'Forward your viands\', and then continuously\nthe next half-verse of \'Agni, come hither to the feast\' [4]. Verily by\nexpiration does he make steadfast his inspiration, and he lives all his days.\nHe, who knows the elbow of the Samidhenis, puts his enemy in his elbow. He\njoins the half-verses; this is the elbow of the Samidhenis; he who knows thus\nputs his foe in his elbow. The Samidhenis were brought out by Rsi after Rsi;\nif they were not connected together, they would go away from the sacrificer\'s\noffspring and cattle. He unites the half-verses; verily he connects them\ntogether, and being so connected and secured they yield him all his desires.\n\n### ii. 5. 8.\n\nWithout a Saman there is no sacrifice. \'O Agni, come hither for the feast\', he\nsays; this is the character of the Rathantara. \'Thee with the kindling-sticks,\nO Angiras\', he says; this is the character of the Vamadevya. \'The great and\npowerful one, O Agni\', he says. This is the character of the Brhat. In that he\nrepeats this Trca, he makes the sacrifice have Samans. Agni was in yonder\nworld, the sun in this; these worlds were disturbed [1]. The gods said, \'Let\nus change them about.\' (Saying), \'O Agni, come hither for the feast\', they\nplaced Agni in this world, and (saying),\'The great and powerful one, O Agni\',\nthey placed the sun in yonder world. Then indeed these worlds became calm. In\nthat he repeats (it) thus, (it serves) for the calming of these worlds; these\nworlds become calm for him who knows thus. He repeats fifteen Samidhenis [2].\nThe nights of the half-month are fifteen; the year is made up of half-months.\nThere are three hundred and sixty syllables in the Samidhenis; there are as\nmany nights in the year; verily by syllables he obtains the year. Nrmedha and\nParuchepa had a theological dispute (and said), \'Let us generate fire in the\ndry wood (to see) which of us two is the more of a theologian.\' Nrmedha spoke;\nhe generated smoke. Paruchepa spoke; he generated fire. \'O Rsi\', he said, [3],\n\'seeing that our knowledge is equal, how didst thou generate fire and not I?\'\n\'I know the character of the Samidhenis\', he replied. The character of the\nSamidhenis is the quarter-verse which is repeated with the word \'ghee\' in it.\n\'Thee with the kindling-sticks, Angiras\', he says; verily he generates light\nin the Samidhenis. They are feminine in that they are Rc (verses), they are\nfeminine in that they are Gayatri (verses), they are feminine in that they are\nSamidhenis. He repeats a verse with the word \'Male\' in it [4]. By it he gives\nthem a husband, makes them possess Indra, and mates them. Agni was the\nmessenger of the gods, U\xc3\xa7anas Kavya of the Asuras. They went to question\nPrajapati; he turned away (from U\xc3\xa7anas) (with the words). \'Agni as messenger\nwe choose.\' Then the gods prospered, the Asuras were defeated. The man for\nwhom, knowing thus, he repeats, \'Agni as messenger we choose, prospers\nhimself, his enemy is defeated. He repeats a verse with the word\n\'imperishable\'; verily by it he causes his enemy to perish [5]. \'The flaming\nlocked, him we adore\', he says; that is purifying; verily with it he makes\npure the sacrificer. \'Thou art lit, O Agni, worshipped\', he says; verily he\nplaces around a barrier that may not be climbed. If he were to add anything\nfurther, it would be just as when (a libation) falls outside the barriers.\nThere are three Agnis, the oblation bearer of the gods, the bearer of the\noffering of the Pitrs, the guardian of the Asuras. They repeat, \'Me will he\nchoose, me\' [6]. \'Choose ye the bearer of the oblation\', he says; \'let him\nchoose him who is of the gods. He chooses one of a Rsi\'s family; verily he\ndeparts not from the connexion, (and so it serves) for continuity. He chooses,\nbeginning at the further end, in order of descent; therefore the Pitrs drink\nafter men in order of descent, beginning at the further end.\n\n### ii. 5. 9.\n\n\'O Agni, thou art great\', he says, for Agni is great. \'O Brahman\', he says,\nfor he is a Brahman. \'O Bharata\',\' he says, for he bears the sacrifice to the\ngods. \'Kindled by the gods\', he says, for the gods kindled him. \'Kindled by\nManu\', he says, for Manu kindled him after the gods. \'Praised by the Rsis\', he\nsays, for the Rsis praised him. \'Rejoiced in by sages\', he says [1], for\nlearned people are sages. \'Celebrated by the poets\', he says, for learned\npeople are the poets. \'Quickened by the holy power (Brahman)\', he says, for he\nis quickened by the holy power (Brahman). \'With ghee offering\', he says, for\nghee is his dearest offering. \'Leader of the sacrifices\', he says, for he is\nthe leader of the sacrifices. \'Charioteer of the rites\', he says, for he is\nthe chariot of the gods. \'The Hotr unsurpassed\', he says, for no one surpasses\nhim [2]. \'Surpassing, bearing the oblation\', he says, for he surpasses all.\n\'The mouth dish, the ladle of the gods\', he says, for he is the ladle of the\ngods. \'The bowl from which the gods drink\', he says, for he is the bowl from\nwhich the gods drink. \'O Agni, like a felly the spokes, thou dost surround the\ngods\', he says, for he surrounds the gods. If he were to say, \'Bring hither\nthe gods to the pious sacrificer\', he would produce an enemy for him [3].2\n\'Bring hither the gods to the sacrificer\', he says; verily with that be makes\nthe sacrificer to grow great. \'O Agni, bring Agni hither, bring Soma hither\',\nhe says; verily he summons the gods in order. \'Bring hither the gods, O Agni;\nand sacrifice to them with a fair sacrifice, O Jatavedas\', he says; verily he\nquickens Agni, and quickened by him he bears the oblation to the gods. \'Agni\nthe Hotr\' [4], he says; Agni is the Hotr of the gods; him he chooses who is\nthe Hotr of the gods. \'We are\', he says; verily he makes himself attain\nreality. \'Fair be to thee the deity, O sacrificer\', he says; verily he invokes\nthis blessing (on him). If he were to say \'Who hast chosen Agni as Hotr\', he\nwould surround the sacrificer with Agni on both sides, and he would be liable\nto perish. The ladle has the sacrificer for its deity, the Upabhrt the enemy\nas its deity [5]. If he were to say two as it were, he would produce an enemy\nfor him. \'Take, Adhvaryu, the spoon ( _sruc_ ) with ghee\', he says; verily by\nit he causes the sacrificer to wax great. \'Pious\', he says, for he aids the\ngods, \'With all boons\', he says, for he aids all. \'Let us praise the gods\nworthy of praise; let us honour those worthy of honour; let us sacrifice to\nthose worthy of sacrifice\', he says. Those worthy of praise are men; those\nworthy of honour are the Pitrs; those worthy of sacrifice are the gods; verily\nhe sacrifices to the deities according to their portions.\n\n### ii. 5. 10.\n\nIn the case of a Rajanya let him repeat the Trcas thrice three other sorts of\nmen are there besides the warrior, the Brahman, Vai\xc3\xa7ya and \xc3\x87udra; verily he\nmakes them obedient to him. He should repeat fifteen (Samidhenis) in the case\nof a Rajanya; the Rajanya is fifteenfold; verily he makes him find support in\nhis own Stoma. Let him surround it with a Tristubh; the Tristubh is power, the\nRajanya sacrifices in desire of power; verily by the Tristubh he secures power\nfor him. If he desires [1], \'May there be splendour\', he should surround it\nwith a Gayatri, the Gayatri is splendour; verily there is splendour. He should\nrepeat seventeen for a Vai\xc3\xa7ya; the Vai\xc3\xa7ya is seventeenfold; verily he makes\nhim find support in his own Stoma. He should surround it with a Jagati; cattle\nare connected with the Jagati, the Vai\xc3\xa7ya sacrifices in desire of cattle;\nverily by the Jagati he secures cattle for him. He should repeat twenty one\nfor one who desires support; the Ekavin\xc3\xa7a is the support of the Stomas;\n(verily twenty-one serve) for support [2]. He should repeat twenty-four for\none who desires splendour: the Gayatri has twenty-four syllables, splendour is\nthe Gayatri; verily by the Gayatri he secures splendour for him. He should\nrepeat thirty for one who desires food; the Viraj has thirty syllables, the\nViraj is food; verily by the Viraj he secures food for him. He should repeat\nthirty-two, for one who desires support; the Anustubh has thirty-two\nsyllables, the Anustubh is the support of the metres; (verily thirty-two\nserve) for support. He should repeat thirty-six for one who desires cattle;\nthe Brhati has thirty-six syllables, cattle are connected with the Brhati;\nverily by the Brhati he secures cattle for him [3]. He should repeat forty-\nfour for one who desires power, the Tristubh has forty-four syllables, the\nTristubh is power; verily by the Tristubh he secures power for him. He should\nrepeat forty-eight for one who desires cattle; the Jagati has forty-eight\nsyllables, cattle are connected with the Jagati; verily with the Jagati he\nsecures cattle for him. He should repeat all the metres for one who makes many\nsacrifices, for all the metres are won by him who makes many sacrifices. He\nshould repeat indefinitely to win that which is not definite.\n\n### ii. 5. 11.\n\nThe thread is worn around the neck for men, over the right shoulder for the\nPitrs, over the left for the gods. He puts it over the left shoulder; verily\nhe makes the mark of the gods. He repeats standing, for standing he speaks\nmore audibly. He repeats standing, to conquer the world of heaven. He\nsacrifices sitting; verily he finds support in this world. In that he repeats\nin the Krau\xc3\xb1ca, note, that is connected with the Asuras, in the low note, that\nis connected with men, in the intermediate note, that is connected with the\ngods. One should repeat in the intermediate note, to secure the gods. Clever\nindeed [1] were the Hotrs of old; there fore the ways were held apart, and the\npaths did not conflict. One foot should be within the sacrificial altar, the\nother outside; then he repeats, to hold the ways apart and to avoid conflict\nof the paths. Then does he win the past and the future, the measured and the\nunmeasured does he win, domestic and wild cattle both does he win [2]; verily\nalso the world of the gods and the world of men he conquers.\n\nThe gods having repeated the Samidhenis could not see the sacrifice. Prajapati\nin silence performed the sprinkling of the butter. Then indeed did the gods\nsee the sacrifice. In that he silently sprinkles, (it serves) to light up the\nsacrifice. Verily also he anoints the kindling-sticks. He who knows thus\nbecomes soft. Verily also he delights them. He delights in offspring and\ncattle [3] who knows thus. If he were to sprinkle with one (verse), he would\ndelight one; if with two, (he would delight) two; if with three, he would make\n(the offering) go beyond (all others). He sprinkles (repeating the verse) in\nthe mind, for what is imperfect is made perfect by mind. He sprinkles across\nso as not to make a failure. Speech and mind disputed; \'I will bear the\noffering to the gods\', speech said; \'I to the gods\', mind said. They went to\nquestion Prajapati; he said [4], Prajapati, \'Thou art the messenger of mind,\nfor what one thinks of in the mind, one utters in speech\'. \'Then assuredly\nthey will not sacrifice to you with speech\', said (speech). Therefore in the\nmind they offer to Prajapati, for Prajapati is, as it were, the mind; (verily\nit serves) to obtain Prajapati. He rubs the enclosing-sticks; verily he\npurifies them. (He rubs) the middle one thrice; the breaths are three; verily\nhe conquers the breaths. (He rubs) the southern one thrice; these worlds are\nthree [5]; verily he conquers these worlds. (He rubs) the northern one thrice;\nthree are the paths leading to the gods; verily he conquers them. Thrice he\nfans (the fire); the worlds of the gods are three; verily he conquers the\nworlds of the gods. They make twelve; the year has twelve months; verily he\ndelights the year; verily also he brings up the year for him, to gain the\nworld of heaven. He sprinkles; the world of heaven is as it were secret [6];\nverily he makes the world of heaven resplendent for him. He sprinkles\nstraight, for the breath is as it were straight. He sprinkles continuously,\nfor the continuity of the breaths and of food and for the smiting away of the\nRaksases. If he desire of a man, \'May he be likely to perish\', he should\nsprinkle crookedly for him; verily he leads his breath crookedly from him, and\nswiftly he perishes. The sprinkling is the head of the sacrifice, the ladle is\nthe body [7]. Having sprinkled, he anoints the ladle; verily he places the\nhead of the sacrifice on its body. Agni was the messenger of the gods, Daivya\nof the Asuras; they went to question Prajapati. Prajapati spake to a Brahman\n(saying), \'Explain the phrase, "Make announcement"\', \'Hearken to this, O ye\ngods\', he said; \'Agni the god is the Hotr\', (he said). He chose him of the\ngods. Then the gods [8] prospered, the Asuras were defeated. The man, who\nknows thus and for whom they chose his list of ancestors, prospers himself,\nhis enemy is defeated. If a Brahman and a non-Brahman have a litigation, one\nshould support the Brahman; if one supports the Brahman, one supports oneself;\nif one opposes the Brahman, one opposes oneself therefore one should not\noppose a Brahman.\n\n### ii. 5. 12.\n\na Life to thee.  \nb Life-giving, O Agni,  \nc Swell up.  \nd Together thee.  \ne Thy wrath.  \nf The uppermost.  \ng Forward, O goddess.  \nh From the sky to us.  \ni O Agni and Visnu.  \nk O Agni and Visnu.  \nl This for me, O Varuna.  \nm To thee for that I go.  \nn Upwards that.  \no The radiant.  \np The child of the waters hath mounted the lap  \nOf the devious ones, rising up and clothed in the lightning;  \nBearing his highest greatness  \nThe golden-coloured young ones go about.  \nq Some [1] meet, some go up,  \nThe streams fill their common stall;  \nRound the pure shining son of the waters  \nThe pure waters stand.  \nr The austere maidens, go around the youth;  \nThe waters, making him clean;  \nAgni shineth forth with pure radiance with wealth,  \nUnkindled, butter-clad in the waters.  \ns I seek the help  \nOf Mitra and Varuna, joint kings;  \nMay they be gracious to such as I.  \nt O Indra and Varuna, grant ye great protection  \nTo our tribe, our people, for the sacrifice [2]  \nMay we conquer in battle the evil-minded,  \nHim who is fain to overpower the man who long sacrificeth.  \nu To us, O Mitra and Varuna.  \nv Forth your arms.  \nw O Agni, do thou, wise one,  \nAppease by sacrifice for us the wrath of Varuna;  \nBest sacrificer, best of bearers, radiant,  \nFree us from every foe.  \nx Do thou, O Agni, be nearest to us,  \nClosest to help, at the dawning of this dawn;  \nAppease for us by sacrifice Varuna [3], bestowing (on him);  \nShow thy mercy and be ready to hear our call.  \ny Far-famed is this Agni of Bharata,  \nSince his great light shineth like the sun;  \nHe who overcame Puru in battle,  \nHath shone forth, the heavenly guest, propitious for us.  \nz I sacrifice to thee, I cast forward my prayer to thee,  \nThat thou mayst be invoked at our invocation;  \nThou art like a well in the desert,  \nThou, O Agni, to the man eager to worship, O ancient king [4].  \naa With his lustre.  \nbb With light.  \ncc Agni, with thy front,  \nBurn the sorceresses,  \nShining in the broad dwellings.  \ndd Thee of fair face, of fair look, the rapid one,  \nThe wiser, let us ignorant people follow;  \nLet him sacrifice who knoweth all the ways,  \nLet him proclaim the oblation among the immortals.  \nee To the freer from trouble.  \nff Which hath entered me.  \ngg Away for us, O Indra.  \nhh O Indra, might.  \nii Powers, O \xc3\x87atakratu.  \nkk To thee hath been given.\n\n\n\n## PRAPATHAKA VI\n\n_\n\nThe New and Full Moon Sacrifices\n\n_\n\n### ii. 6. 1.\n\nHe offers to the kindling-sticks; verily he wins spring among the seasons. He\noffers to Tanunapat; verily he wins the hot season. He offers to the\noblations; verily he wins the rains. He offers to the sacrificial strew,\nverily lie wins autumn. He offers with the cry of \'Hail!\'; verily he wins the\nwinter. Therefore in winter animals over which the cry of \'Hail!\' is raised\nperish. He offers to the kindling-sticks; verily he wins the dawns of the\ngoddesses. He offers to Tanunapat; verily he wins the sacrifice [1]. He offers\nto the oblations; verily he wins cattle. He offers to the sacrificial strew;\nverily he wins offspring. He takes (the oblation) from the Upabhrt. The\noblation is brilliance, the sacrificial strew off spring; verily he places\nbrilliance in offspring. He offers with the cry of \'Hail!\'; verily he wins\nspeech. They make up ten, the Viraj has ten syllables, the Viraj is food;\nverily he wins food by the Viraj. He offers to the kindling-sticks; verily he\nfinds support in this world. He offers to Tanunapat [2]; verily in the\nsacrifice and in the atmosphere he finds support. He offers to the oblations;\nverily in cattle he finds support. He offers to the sacrificial strew; verily\nhe finds support in the paths that lead to the gods. He offers with the cry of\n\'Hail!\'; verily he finds support in the world of heaven. So many are the\nworlds of the gods; verily in them in order he finds support. The gods and the\nAsuras contended as to these worlds. The gods by the fore-sacrifices drove the\nAsuras away from these worlds; that is why the fore-sacrifices [3] are so\ncalled. He for whom knowing thus are offered the fore-sacrifices, drives his\nenemy away from these worlds. He offers stepping near, for conquest. He who\nknows the pairing of the fore sacrifices is propagated with offspring, with\ncattle, with pairings. He offers to the kindling-sticks as many, to Tanunapat\nas one, and that makes a pair. He offers to the kindling-sticks as many, to\nthe sacrificial strew as one, and that makes a pair. That is the pairing of\nthe fore-sacrifices. He who knows thus [4] is propagated with offspring, with\ncattle, with pairings. These deities were not sacrificed to by the gods; then\nthe Asuras were fain to harm the sacrifice. The gods divided the Gayatri, five\nsyllables in front and three behind. Then the sacrifice was protected, and the\nsacrificer. In that the fore- and after-sacrifices are offered, protection is\nafforded to the sacrifice and to the sacrificer, for the overcoming of the\nenemy. Therefore a covering is larger in front and smaller behind. The gods\nthought that the sacrifice must be completed (in the fore-sacrifice) before\nthe Raksases [5] with the cry of \'Hail!\' They completed it with the cry of\n\'Hail!\' in the fore-sacrifices. They split the sacrifice who complete it with\nthe cry of \'Hail!\' in the fore-sacrifices. Having offered the fore sacrifices\nhe sprinkles the oblations, for the continuity of the sacrifice; then verily\nhe makes the oblation, and then he proceeds in order. The fore-sacrifices are\nthe father, the after-sacrifices the son; in that having offered the fore-\nsacrifices he sprinkles the oblations, the father makes common property with\nthe son [6]. Therefore they say, who know it or who know not, \'How is it the\nson\'s only, how is the father\'s common?\' That which spills when the fore-\nsacrifices are offered is not really spilt. The Gayatri conceives through it,\nand produces offspring and cattle for the sacrificer.\n\n### ii. 6. 2.\n\nThe two portions of the oblation are the eyes of the sacrifice. In that he\noffers the two portions of the oblation, he inserts the two eyes of the\nsacrifice. He offers in the front place; therefore the eyes are in front. He\noffers evenly; therefore the eyes are even. By Agni the sacrificer discerns\nthe world of the gods, by Soma the world of the Pitrs; in the north part he\noffers to Agni, in the south to Soma, for these worlds are thus, as it were,\nto illumine these worlds. Agni and Soma are the kings of the gods [1]. They\nare sacrificed to between the gods, to separate the gods. Therefore men are\nseparated by the king. The theologians say, \'What is it that the sacrificer\ndoes in the sacrifice to support both those animals which have incisors on one\nside only and those which have incisors on both?\' When he has repeated a Rc,\nhe makes an offering of the portion of the oblation with the _jusana_ formula;\nby that means he supports those with incisors on one side only. When he has\nrepeated a Rc, he makes an offering of the sacrificial food ( _havis_ ) with a\nRc; by that means he supports those with incisors on both sides. The\nPuronuvakya contains the word \'head\'; verily he makes him head of his peers\n[2]. He offers with averse containing the word \'team\' ( _niyut_ ); verily he\nappropriates ( _ni-yu_ ) the cattle of his enemy. Ke\xc3\xa7in Satyakami said to\nKe\xc3\xa7in Darbhya, \'The seven-footed \xc3\x87akvari I shall use for thee at the sacrifice\nto-morrow, by whose strength one defeats the enemies that have arisen and\nthose that shall be, by the first half of whose strength the ox feeds, by the\nsecond half the cow.\' The Puronuvakya is marked in front; verily he defeats\nthe enemies that have arisen; the Yajya is marked behind [3]; verily he\ndefeats the enemies that shall be. The Puronuvakya is marked in front; verily\nhe places light in this world; the Yajya is marked behind; verily he places\nlight in yonder world. Full of light become these worlds to him who knows\nthus. The Puronuvakya, is marked in front; therefore the ox feeds with the\nfirst half. The Yajya is marked behind; therefore the cow feeds with the\nsecond half. Him who knows thus these two enjoy. The oblation is a bolt, the\nportions of the oblation are a bolt [4], the Vasat call is a bolt; thus forges\nbe a threefold bolt and hurls it at his foe, so as not to make a failure. He\nutters the Vasat call in anger, to lay low his foe. The Puronuvakya is the\nGayatri, the Yajya the Tristubh; verily he makes the ruling class dependent on\nthe priestly class; therefore the Brahman is the chief. The chief he becomes\nwho knows thus. He proclaims him with the Puronuvakya, leads him forward with\nthe Yajya, and makes him go with the Vasat call. He takes him with the\nPuronuvakya, he gives him with the Yajya, and [5] establishes him with the\nVasat call. The Puronuvakya has three feet; these worlds are three; verily he\nfinds support in these worlds. The Yajya has four feet; verily he wins four\nfooted cattle. The Vasat call has two syllables, the sacrificer has two feet;\nverily afterwards he finds support in cattle. The Puronuvakya is the Gayatri,\nthe Yajya, the Tristubh, and this is the sevenfooted \xc3\x87akvari. Whatever the\ngods were fain to do by it, that they were able to do; he who knows thus can\ndo whatever he is fain to do.\n\n### ii. 6. 3.\n\nPrajapati assigned the sacrifices to the gods. He placed in himself the\noblation. The gods said to him, \'The oblation is the sacrifice; let us have a\nshare in it.\' He said, \'Lot them offer to you the portions of the oblation,\nlet them pour out (a layer), let them sprinkle (it).\' Therefore they offer the\nportions of the oblation, they pour out (a layer), and sprinkle (it). The\ntheologians say, \'For what reason are the other offerings worn out, but the\noblation fresh?\' He should reply, \'Because it is Prajapati\'s [1], for\nPrajapati is of the gods the fresh one.\' The metres ran away from the gods\n(saying), \'We will not bear the offering, if we have no share.\' They kept for\nthem (the offering) divided into four parts, for the Puronuvakya, the Yajya,\nthe deity, the Vasat call. In that he offers (the offering) in four parts, he\ndelights the metres, and they delighted by him carry the offering to the gods.\nThe Angirases were the last to go hence to the world of heaven. The Rsis came\nto the place of sacrifice; they [2] saw the sacrificial cake creeping about,\nhaving become a tortoise. They said to it, \'Be firm for Indra; be firm for\nBrhaspati: be firm for the All-gods.\' It did not become firm. They said to it,\n\'Be firm for Agni.\' It became firm for Agni. In that (the cake) for Agni on\neight potsherds is unmoved at the full and at the new moon, (it serves) to\nconquer the world of heaven. They said to it, \'How hast thou been left?\' \'I\nhave not been anointed\', he said, \'just as an axle not anointed [3] goes\nwrong, so I have gone wrong.\' After anointing it above, he anoints it below,\nto gain the world of heaven. He spreads (the cake) on all the fragments; so\nmany cakes does he conquer in yonder world. That which is burnt belongs to\nNirrti, that which is not cooked to Rudra, that which is cooked to the gods.\nTherefore one should cook it, without burning it, for the gods. He covers it\nwith ashes; therefore the bones are clothed with flesh. He covers it with the\nbunch of grass; therefore [4] the head is covered with hair. The offering\nwhich is cooked without being sprinkled has fallen from this world, but has\nnot reached the world of the gods. He sprinkles it before covering it; verily\nhe makes it go among the gods. If one fragment were lost, one month of the\nyear would be omitted, and the sacrificer would perish. If two were lost, two\nmonths of the year would be omitted, and the sacrificer would perish. He\ncounts before covering, to guard the sacrificer [5]. If it be lost, be should\nmake an offering on two potsherds to the A\xc3\xa7vins, and on one potsherd to sky\nand earth. The A\xc3\xa7vins are the physicians of the gods; verily by them he heals\nit. Then is offered an offering on one potsherd to sky and earth; in them is\nlost what is lost; verily in them he finds it, (and it serves) for support.\n\n### ii. 6. 4.\n\n(Saying) \'On the impulse of the god Savitr thee\', he takes the sword, for\nimpelling. \'With the arms of the A\xc3\xa7vins\', he says, for the A\xc3\xa7vins were the\nAdhvaryus of the gods. \'With the hands of Pusan\', he says, for restraint.\n\'Thou art a hundred-edged, of the tree, slayer of the foe\', he says; verily he\nsharpens the bolt, being about to hurl it at his enemy. He throws away the\ngrass with a Yajus. The earth is the size of the altar; verily he deprives his\nenemy of so much of that [1]. Therefore they do not deprive one who has no\nshare. He throws it away thrice; these worlds are three; verily he excludes\nhim from these worlds. He throws it silently a fourth time; verily he excludes\nhim from the unmeasured. He uproots it; verily what of it is impure he cuts\noff. He uproots it; therefore the plants perish. He cuts the root; verily he\ncuts the root of the enemy. If dug too deep, it has the Pitrs for its deity;\nso much does he dig as is measured [2] by Prajapati as the mouth of the\nsacrifice. He digs until (he reaches) support; verily he causes the sacrificer\nto reach support. He makes it higher on the south; verily he makes it the form\nof the sacrificial ground. He makes it full of loose earth; loose earth is\noffspring and cattle; verily he makes him full of offspring and cattle. He\nperforms the second drawing of a boundary. The earth is the size of the altar;\nverily having excluded his enemy from so much of it, he performs the second\ndrawing of a boundary for himself. Cruelly he acts [3] in making an altar.\n(With the words) \'Thou art the holder, thou art the self holder\', it is made\nsmooth, for healing. He places the sprinkling waters; the waters are Raksas-\nslaying; (verily they serve) for slaying the Raksases. He places them in the\npath made by the sword, for the continuity of the sacrifice. He should think\nof any one whom he hates; verily does he inflict trouble upon him.\n\n### ii. 6. 5.\n\nThe theologians say, \'Thou hast sprinkled the offerings with water; but the\nwaters with what?\' \'With the holy power (Brahman)\', he should say, for verily\nhe sprinkles the offerings with water, and the waters with the holy power\n(Brahman). He sprinkles the kindling-wood and the sacrificial strew; verily he\nmakes it pure. He sprinkles the altar, the altar was rough, hairless, and\nimpure; verily he makes it pure. \'To the sky thee, to the atmosphere thee, to\nearth thee\', (with these words) he places the sacrificial strew and sprinkles\nit [1]; verily he sprinkles it for these worlds. Cruelly indeed does he act in\nthat he digs. He pours down the waters, for healing. He takes the bunch in\nfront; verily he makes it the chief. He takes so much as is measured by\nPrajapati as the mouth of the sacrifice. He spreads the sacrificial strew, the\nsacrificial strew is offspring, the altar is the earth; verily he places\noffspring on the earth. He strews it so as not to be very discernible; verily\nhe makes him not very discernible by offspring and cattle [2]. He puts the\nbundle over the sacrificial strew, the strew is offspring, the bundle the\nsacrificer; verily he makes the sacrificer superior to the non-sacrificer.\nTherefore the sacrificer is superior to the non-sacrificer. He puts (grass)\nbetween, for separation. He anoints it; verily he makes it into an offering\nand causes it to go to the world of heaven. He anoints it in three places;\nthese worlds are three; verily he anoints it for these worlds. He does not\nbreak off (its edges); if he were to break them off, it would not go aloft for\nthe sacrificer. He pushes it upwards as it were [3], for the world of heaven\nis upwards as it were. He depresses it; verily he brings down rain for him. He\nshould not put forward the points too much; if he were to do so, there would\nbe a violent torrent to destroy the Adhvaryu. He should not throw it (so that\nthe roots are) in front. If he were to do this, he would thrust the sacrificer\nfrom the world of heaven. He puts it forward (with its points) to the east;\nverily he makes the sacrificer go to the world of heaven. He should not spread\n(the bunch) in all directions. If he were to spread (it) in all directions\n[4], a daughter would be born to him. He strews it upwards, for upwards is as\nit were connected with a man; verily a male child is born to him. If he were\nto smooth it with the sword or the poking-stick, that would be his ruin. He\nsmooths it with his hand, for the protection of the sacrificer. The\ntheologians say, \'What in the sacrifice is the sacrificer\' \'The bundle\' (is\nthe reply). \'Where in it is the world of heaven?\' \'The Ahavaniya (fire)\' he\nshould reply. In that he puts the bundle on the Ahavaniya, he makes the\nsacrificer [5] go to the world of heaven. The sacrificer is rent in that they\nsmooth the bundle; he throws the strew along after it, for calming. The\nAdhvaryu has no support, and he is liable to be seized by shivering. (With the\nwords), \'Thou art firm ( _dhruva_ )\', he strokes it; the Dhruva is this\n(earth); verily he finds support in it, and shivers not. \'Has he gone, O\nAgnidh? he says. If (the Agnidh) were to say, \'Agni has gone?\' he would make\nAgni go into the fire, and exclude the sacrificer from the world of heaven. So\nhe should say only \'Has he gone?\' Verily he makes the sacrificer go to the\nworld of heaven.\n\n### ii. 6. 6.\n\nAgni had three elder brothers; they perished while carrying the offering to\nthe gods. Agni was afraid, \'Thus indeed will this one fall on misfortune.\' He\nran away, and entered the waters. The gods sought to start him up. The fish\nproclaimed him, and he cursed it, \'At Pleasure may they slay thee, since thou\nhast proclaimed me.\' So they slay the fish at pleasure, for he is cursed [1].\nThey found him; they said, \'Come to us, and carry the offering for us.\' He\nsaid, \'Let me choose a boon; whatever of the offering when it is taken (in the\nladle) falls outside the enclosing-sticks, let that be the share of my\nbrothers.\' There fore whatever of the offering when it is taken falls outside\nthe enclosing sticks is their share; verily by it he delights them. He puts\nthe enclosing sticks around, to smite away the Raksases. He makes them touch\n[2], so that the Raksases may not creep through. He puts none in front, for\nthe sun rises in front and smites away the Raksases. He places the two\nkindling-sticks upright, for upwards they smite away the Raksases. (He places)\none with a Yajus, the other in silence, to make a pair. He places two, the\nsacrificer has two feet, for support. The theologians say, \'He indeed would be\na sacrificer who should be the stronger for a failure in the sacrifice.\' (The\nwords), \'To the lord of earth hail! To the lord of the world, hail! To the\nlord of creatures [3] hail! \' he should pronounce over the spilt (offering).\nThus by a failure in the sacrifice he becomes stronger, for he delights more\ngods (than usual). There is sameness in the sacrifice, in that there are two\nsacrificial cakes (offered) in order. Between them he offers the silent\nsacrifice, to break the sameness and to make a pair. Agni was in yonder world,\nYama in this. The gods said, \'Come, let us interchange them\'; with food the\ngods invited Agni [4], with the kingdom the Pitrs Yama; therefore is Agni the\nfood-eater of the gods, Yama the king of the Pitrs; he who knows thus obtains\nthe kingdom and food. To him they gave that share which they cut off for Agni\nSvistakrt. In that he cuts off a share for Agni Svistakrt, he gives Rudra a\nshare. He cuts off one in each case, for Rudra is one as it were. He cuts off\nfrom the north part, for this is Rudra\'s [5] quarter; verily he appeases Rudra\nin his own quarter. He sprinkles it twice, to make it divided into four. The\nformer offerings are cattle, Agni is Rudra here; if he were to pour over the\nformer offerings, he would give Rudra cattle, and the sacrificer would be\nwithout cattle. He offers leaving the former oblations aside, to protect the\ncattle.\n\n_\n\nThe Part of the Hotr in the New and Full Moon Sacrifice\n\n_\n\n### ii. 6. 7.\n\nManu desired what of earth was sacrificial. He found the poured out ghee. He\nsaid, \'Who is able to produce this also at the sacrifice?\' Mitra and Varuna\nsaid, \'We are able to produce the cow.\' Then they set the cow in motion.\nWherever she stepped, there ghee was pressed out; therefore she is called\nghee-footed; that is her origin. \'The Rathantara is invoked with the earth\',\nhe says [1]. The Rathantara is this (earth); verily he invokes her with food.\n\'The Vamadevya is invoked with the atmosphere\', he says. The Vamadevya, is\ncattle; verily he invokes cattle with the atmosphere. \'The Brhat is invoked\nwith the sky\', he says. The Brhat is connected with food; verily he invokes\nfood with the sky. \' The seven Hotras are invoked\', he says; verily he invokes\nthe Hotras. \'The cow is invoked with the bull\', he says [2]; verily he invokes\na pair. \'The friend food is invoked\', he says; verily he invokes the Soma\ndrink. \'It is invoked; ho!\' he says; verily he invokes the self, for the self\nis the best of those invoked. He invokes food, food is cattle; verily he\ninvokes cattle. He invokes four, for cattle are four-footed. \'Offspring of\nManu\', he says, for Manu first saw her [3]. \'Ghee-footed\', he says. Because\nghee was pressed out of her foot, therefore be says thus. \'Of Mitra and\nVaruna\', he says, for Mitra and Varuna set her in motion. \'The Brahman, god\nmade, is invoked\', he says; verily he invokes the Brahman. \'The divine\nAdhvaryus are invoked, the human are invoked\', he says; verily he invokes the\ngods and men. \'Who shall help this sacrifice and make the lord of the\nsacrifice prosper\', he says [4]; verily he invokes a blessing for the\nsacrifice and the sacrificer. \'Sky and earth are invoked\', he says; verily he\ninvokes sky and earth. \'Born of yore, the righteous\', he says, for they were\nborn of yore and are righteous. \'Divine, with gods for children\', he says, for\nthey are divine and have gods for children. \'Invoked is this sacrificer\', he\nsays; verily he invokes the sacrificer. \'Invoked in the highest sacrifice,\ninvoked in the greater offering, invoked in the divine abode\' [5], he says.\nThe highest sacrifice is offspring, the greater offering is cattle, the divine\nabode is the world of heaven. (With the words), \'Thou art this; thou art\nthis\', he invokes the dear abode of the sacrifice. \'All that is dear to it is\ninvoked\', he says; verily not vainly does he invoke.\n\n### ii. 6. 8.\n\nFood is cattle, he takes it himself; verily by himself he fills his desires of\ncattle, for no one else can grant him his desire of cattle. \'Thee offered to\nthe lord of speech I eat\', he says; verily he delights speech with a share.\n\'Thee offered to the lord of the Sadas I eat\', he says, for completion.\' (The\nfood) is divided. in four; what is divided in four is the offering, what is\ndivided in four is cattle; if the Hotr were to eat it, the Hotr would [1]\nexperience misfortune; if he were to offer it in the fire, he would give the\ncattle to Rudra, and the sacrificer would be without cattle. \'Thee offered to\nthe lord of speech I eat\', he says; verily secretly does he offer it. \'Thee\noffered to the lord of the Sadas\', he says, for completion. They eat; they eat\nat a suitable moment; he gives a sacrificial gift; at a suitable moment be\ngives a gift. They cleave the sacrifice [2], if they eat in the middle. They\npurify it with water; all the gods are the waters; verily they connect the\nsacrifice with the gods. The gods excluded Rudra from the sacrifice; he\npierced the sacrifice, the gods gathered round it (saying), \'May it be right\nfor us.\' They said, \'Well offered will this be for us, if we propitiate him.\'\nThat is why Agni is called the \'well offerer\' ( _svistakrt_ ). When it was\npierced (by him) [3] they cut off (a piece) of the size of a barleycorn;\ntherefore one should cut off (a piece) the size of a barleycorn. If one were\nto cut off more, he would confuse that part of the sacrifice. If he were to\nmake a layer and then to sprinkle, lie would make it swell on both sides. He\ncuts it off and sprinkles it; there are two operations; the sacrificer has two\nfeet, for support. If he were to transfer it (to the Brahman) crosswise, he\nwould pierce the unwounded part of the sacrifice; lie transfers it in front;\nverily he transfers it in the proper way. They transferred it for Pusan [4].\nPusan having eaten it lost his teeth; therefore Pusan has pounded food for his\nshare, for he has no teeth. The gods said of him, \'He has lost (his teeth), he\nis not fit for the offering.\' They transferred it to Brhaspati. Brhaspati was\nafraid, \'Thus indeed will this one fall on misfortune.\' He saw this Mantra;\n\'With the eye of the sun I gaze on thee\', he said, for the eye of the sun\nharms no one [5]. He was afraid, \'It will harm me as I take it.\' \'On the\nimpulse of the god Savitr, with the arms of the A\xc3\xa7vins, with the hands of\nPusan I take thee\', he says; verily, impelled by Savitr, he took it with the\nholy power (Brahman) and with the gods. He was afraid, \'It will harm me as I\neat.\' \'Thee with the mouth of Agni I eat\', he said, for nothing harms the\nmouth of Agni. He was afraid [6], \'It will harm me when I have eaten.\' \'With\nthe belly of the Brahman\', he said, for nothing harms the belly of the\nBrahman. \'With the holy power (Brahman) of Brhaspati\', (he said), for he is\nfullest of the holy power (Brahman). The breaths indeed depart from him who\neats this offering; by purifying it with water he grasps the breaths; the\nbreaths are ambrosia, the waters ambrosia; verily he summons the breaths\naccording to their places.\n\n### ii. 6. 9.\n\nHe takes a portion for the Agnidh; verily he delights the seasons whose mouth\nis Agni. He takes a kindling-stick, for the support of the subsequent\nofferings; verily he pours on that which has a kindling stick. He rubs the\nenclosing-sticks; verily he purifies them. He rubs each once, for the\nsacrifice there is as it were turned away. It makes up four, cattle are four-\nfooted; verily he wins cattle. \'O Brahman, will we set out?\' he says; there\nindeed is the sacrifice placed [1], where the Brahman is; where the sacrifice\nis placed, thence does he commence it. If he were to instigate him with his\nhand, he would shiver; if with his head, he would have a headache; if he were\nto sit in silence, the sacrifice would not proceed; he should say, \'Set out!\nIn speech the sacrifice is placed; where the sacrifice is placed, thence does\nhe bestow it. \'O god Savitr, that he [2] hath proclaimed to thee\', he says,\nfor impelling. \'Brhaspati is the (priest) Brahman\', he says, for he is fullest\nof the holy power (Brahman). \'Do thou guard the sacrifice, guard the lord of\nthe sacrifice, guard me\', he says; for the sacrifice, the sacrificer, and\nhimself, for these he thus invokes a blessing, to prevent misfortune, Having\ncaused (him) to call out, he says, \'Utter the verse for sacrifice to the\ngods.\' The theologians say, \'The gods have been sacrificed to; what gods are\nthey?\' \'The metres\', he should reply, \'Gayatri Tristubh [3], and Jagati.\' Then\nthey say, \'The metres are the Brahmans\'; verily he sacrifices to them. The\ndeities were sacrificed to by the gods; then Agni did not burn forth; the gods\nfound him by the offerings in the after-sacrifices; in that he offers the\nafter-sacrifices verily thus one kindles Agni. There was an Asura, named\nEtadu. He then appropriated the blessing of the sacrifice. If one were to say,\n\'That indeed ( _et ad u_) hath been glorious, O sky and earth\' [4], one would\ncause Etadu to attain the blessing of the sacrifice. \'This ( _id am_) has been\nglorious, sky and earth\', he should say; verily he makes the sacrificer attain\nthe blessing of the sacrifice. \'We have won the utterance of prayer and\nhomage\', he says; \'we have won this\', he says in effect. \'It resteth on sky\nand earth\', he says, for the sacrifice rests on the sky and earth. \'Helpful\nfor thee in this sacrifice, O sacrificer, be sky and earth\' [5], he says;\nverily he invokes this blessing. If he were to say, \'easy of access and easy\nto dwell on\', the sacrificer would be likely to perish, for when he perishes\nhe has recourse to this (earth). \'Easy of approach, and easy to move on\', he\nshould say; verily he invokes for him a wider sphere, and he is not likely to\nperish. \'In the knowledge of these two Agni hath rejoiced in this offering\',\nhe says; \'the gods we have sacrificed to [6], we have made them to prosper\',\nhe says in effect. If he were not to indicate (the sacrificer), the blessing\nof the sacrifice would go to his neighbour. \'This sacrificer imploreth (a\nblessing) N. N.\', he says; verily by indicating him he makes him attain the\nworld of heaven. \'He imploreth length of days, he imploreth a noble offspring,\nhe says; verily he invokes this blessing. \'He imploreth superiority over his\nequals\', he says; his equals are the breaths; verily he does not obstruct his\nbreaths [7]. \'Agni shall win, god, from the gods, we men from Agni\', he says,\n\'Agni wins from the gods, we from men\', he says in effect. \'Here is the path\nof favour, and this our homage to the gods\', he says; to both the gods whom he\nsacrifices to and those to whom he does not sacrifice, he pays homage, for his\nown security.\n\n### ii. 6. 10.\n\nThe gods could not find any one to utter the call Svaga at the sacrifice. They\nspoke to \xc3\x87amyu Barhaspatya, \'Perform the Svaga call at this sacrifice for us.\'\nHe said, \'Let me choose a boon; if a faithless man sacrifice, or a man\nsacrifices without prescription, let the blessing of such a sacrificer be\nmine.\' Therefore if a faithless man sacrifices, or a man sacrifices without\nprescription, the blessing of such a sacrifice goes to \xc3\x87amyu Barhaspatya.\n\'That is mine\', he said, \'What is to belong to my offspring? [1].\' \'Him, who\nreviles him, he shall fine with a hundred; him, who strikes him, he shall fine\nwith a thousand; he, who draws blood from him, shall not behold the world of\nthe Pitrs for as many years as are the grains of dust which the blood in its\nfall seizes upon\', (they replied). Therefore one should not revile a Brahman,\nnor strike him, nor draw blood from him; for so great is his sin. \'That health\nand wealth we choose\', he says; verily he utters the call Svaga, over the\nsacrifice. \'That [2] health and wealth we choose\', he says; verily he gives\n\xc3\x87amyu Barhaspatya his portion. \'Success to the sacrifice, success to the\nsacrificer\', he says; verily he invokes this blessing. He sacrifices to Soma;\nverily he places seed; he sacrifices to Tvastr; seed is placed and Tvastr\nmoulds forms; he sacrifices to the wives of the gods, to make a pair; he\nsacrifices to Agni, lord of the house, for support. There is sameness in the\nsacrifice [3] in that the fore-sacrifices are offered with butter, and the\nsacrifices to the wives (are offered) with butter. Having repeated the Rc, of\nthe sacrifices to the wives he offers with a Rc, to prevent sameness, and to\nmake a pairing. The sacrifice has a fivefold prelude and a fivefold end; there\nare offered five fore-sacrifices; there are four sacrifices to the wives, the\nfifth is the Samistayajus by they make up five as a prelude, and five as an\nend.\n\n### ii. 6. 11.\n\na.
