The golden-haired in the expanse [1](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:1:1) of the\natmosphere, the roaring [2](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:1:2) snake, is hasting\n(through the air) like the wind; the brightly resplendent watcher of the dawn\n[3](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:1:3), he who is like the glorious, ever active and\ntruthful (goddesses) [4](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:1:4).\n\n2\\. By thy goings the beautifully-winged (birds) were disparaged\n[1](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:2:1); the black bull [2](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:2:2)\nhas roared, when here [3](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:2:3) (all this happened). He\nhas come as if with the bounteous smiling (women)\n[4](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:2:4). The mists fly, the clouds thunder.\n\n3\\. When they have led him, who swells [1](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:3:1) with the\nmilk of _Ri_ ta, on the straightest paths of _Ri_ ta, then Aryaman, Mitra, and\nVaru _n_ a, he who walks round the earth [2](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:3:2), fill\nthe leather-bag (the cloud) in the womb of the lower (atmosphere [?])\n[3](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:3:3).\n\n#### II.\n\n4\\. Agni, who art lord of booty, rich in cows, young son of strength\n[1](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:4:1), bestow on us, O _G_ atavedas, great glory.\n\n5\\. Being lighted, a Vasu, a sage, Agni who is to be magnified by (pious)\nwords, O (god) with many faces, shine to us so that riches may be ours.\n\n6\\. Reigning [1](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:6:1) by night by thy own power, O Agni,\nand at the break of dawn, O god with sharp teeth, burn against the sorcerers.\n\np. 104\n\n#### III.\n\n7\\. Bless us, O Agni, with thy blessings, when our Gayatra song is brought\nforward (to thee), thou to whom reverence is due in all our prayers.\n\n8\\. Bring us wealth, O Agni, which may be always conquering, excellent and\ninvincible [1](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:8:1) in all battles.\n\n9\\. Bestow on us, Agni, through thy kindness [1](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:9:1)\nwealth which may last all our life [2](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:9:2), and have\nmercy [3](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:9:3) on us that we may live.\n\n#### IV.\n\n10\\. O Gotama [1](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:10:1), bring forward purified words,\nbring songs to the sharp-flaming Agni, desirous of his favour.\n\n11\\. May he who tries to harm us, whether nigh or afar, fall down. Do thou\nlead us alone to increase.\n\n12\\. The thousand-eyed Agni, who dwells among all tribes, scares away the\nRakshas. The praiseworthy Hot _ri_ (Agni) is praised\n[1](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:12:1).\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi. Metre, 1-3 Trish _t_ ubh; 4-6 Ush _n_ ih; 7-12 Gayatri.\n\nWhat in the traditional text is one hymn, consists really of four independent\nhymns of three verses each. This is to be concluded from the well-known laws\nof arrangement of the Sa _m_ hita, and is confirmed by the change of metre and\nby the reception of two of the four hymns into other Vedic Sa _m_ hitas: the\nsecond (verses 4-6) is found in the Sama-veda II, 911-913; Va _g_. Sa _m_ hita\nXV, 35-37; Taitt.\n\np. 105\n\n[paragraph continues] Sa _m_ hita IV, 4, 4, 5; Maitr. Sa _m_ hita II, 13, 8;\nthe third (verses 7-9) in the Sama-veda II, 874-876\\. Besides, verses 1-2\noccur Taitt. Sa _m_ h. III, 1, 11, 4-5; verse 2, Maitr. Sa _m_ h. IV, 12, 5;\nverse 4, Sama-veda I, 99; verses 8, 9, Maitr. Sa _m_ h. IV, 12, 4; verse 9,\nMaitr. Sa _m_ h. IV, 10, 6; Taitt. Br. II, 4, 5, 3.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. As to visara I think we should compare VII, 36, 1. vi sa\xc2\xb4nuna p _ri_\nthivi\xc2\xb4 sasre urvi\xc2\xb4, 'The wide earth has expanded with her surface.' Prof. Max\nMuller observes with regard to this Pada: when the sky sends forth the rain,\nthe lightning appears.\n\nNote 2. On dhuni, see vol. xxxii, p. 112 (I, 64, 5), and Geldner, Vedische\nStudien, I, 268. I do not take the word with Geldner for an epithet of Vata,\nthe wind, but of the snake, i. e. Agni, who very probably is to be understood\nhere as in the whole T _ri_ _k_ a, as the fire of the lightning.\n\nNote 3. Perhaps we have here again a Pada of ten syllables, of the type which\noccurs several times in the preceding hymns. Or possibly the text should be\ncorrected: ushasa _l_ e na naveda _h_ , 'a knower (of sacrifices, comp. IV,\n23, 4; V, 12, 3) like the dawns,' or ushasam naveda _h_ (with dissyllabic\n-am), 'a knower of the dawns.'--See Lanman, p. 565.\n\nNote 4. The waters? Or the dawns?\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. On the nasalization of aminantan\xcc\x90 in the Sa _m_ hita text, see my\nProlegomena, p. 471.\n\nNote 2. I. e. Par _g_ anya, the thundering cloud. Comp. V, 83, 1; VII, 10t, 1;\nBergaigne, Rel. Vedique, III, 27 seq.\n\nNote 3. Regarding yadi idam, comp. IV, 5, 11. There the verb belonging to yadi\nmust be supplied; in the same way our passage must be interpreted also, unless\nwe resort to changing the text and accentuating the verb nonava, in which case\nthe translation would be, 'when the black bull has bellowed here.'\n\np. 106\n\nNote 4. The women may be the showers of rain. Or they could be understood as\nthe dawns,. comp. ushasa _h_ naveda _h_ , verse 1.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. I propose to read piyanam.\n\nNote 2. On pari _g_ man, see Joh. Schmidt, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXV, 86;\nBartholomae, Bezzenberger's Beitrage, XV, 27 seq.; Bergaigne, Rel. Ved. II,\n505; and compare especially X, 93, 4. The word evidently is connected not with\nthe verb gam, but with ksham, 'the earth,' of which we find the genitives gma\n_h_ and _g_ ma _h_.\n\nNote 3. It does not seem probable to me that upara means here the lower\npressing-stone, as Grassmann, Ludwig, and Pischel (Vedische Studien, I, 109)\nsuggest (Grassmann: den Schlauch beim untern Pressstein. Ludwig: den schlauch\n\xe2\x80\xa6 an des steines ort. Pischel: sie legen das Fell mitten auf den Stein). I\npropose to supply ra _g_ asa _h_ ; comp. I, 62, 5. ra _g_ a _h_ uparam; IV, 1,\n11. ra _g_ asa _h_ asya yonau, and especially IV, 17, 14, where we find the\n'womb of the atmosphere' (ra _g_ asa _h_ asya yonau) mentioned, quite as in\nour passage, together with the leather-bag (tva _k_ ), i. e. the cloud.--\nBergaigne (Rel. Ved. II, 505) translates and explains, 'arrose la peau dans le\nsejour de l'inferieur,' c'est-a-dire fait couler les eaux du ciel pour l'Agni\nterrestre.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. See above, I, 26, 10, note 1.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Ra _g_ an seems to be the participle of ra _g_ ; comp. VIII, 19, 3i.\nkshapa _h_ vastushu ra _g_ asi. Now it is very improbable that of this\nparticiple a vocative should occur; see Lanman, 509. I believe, therefore,\nthat we should accentuate ra\xc2\xb4 _g_ an (comp. the remarks of Bartholomae,\nBezzenberger's Beitrage, XV, 204).\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. Comp. IX, 63, 11. rayim \xe2\x80\xa6 dush _t_ aram.\n\np. 107\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. As to su _k_ etuna, comp. I, 159, 5.\n\nNote 2. Comp. VI, 59, 9. rayim vi _s_ va\xc2\xb4yuposhasam.\n\nNote 3. Mar _d_ ikam is a second object of dhehi, not an epithet of rayim.\nComp. VIII, 7, 30.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. Comp. above, 78, 2, note 1.\n\n##### Verse 12.\n\nNote 1. On the use of the middle of g _ri_ with passive meaning, comp.\nDelbruck, Altindische Syntax, 264.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 94](sbe46030.htm)\n\n"
