If you object on the ground of the observation of the employment (of\ninstruments); (we say), No; because as milk (transforms itself, so Brahman\ndoes).\n\nYour assertion that the intelligent Brahman alone, without a second, is the\ncause of the world cannot be maintained, on account of the observation of\nemployment (of instruments). For in ordinary life we see that potters,\nweavers, and other handicraftsmen produce jars, cloth, and the like, after\nhaving put themselves in possession of the means thereto by providing\nthemselves with various implements, such as clay, staffs, wheels, string, &c.;\nBrahman, on the other hand, you conceive to be without any help; how then can\nit act as a creator without providing itself with instruments to work with? We\ntherefore maintain that Brahman is not the cause of the world.\n\nThis objection is not valid, because causation is possible\n\np. 347\n\nin consequence of a peculiar constitution of the causal substance, as in the\ncase of milk. Just as milk and water turn into curds and ice respectively,\nwithout any extraneous means, so it is in the case of Brahman also. And if you\nobject to this analogy for the reason that milk, in order to turn into curds,\ndoes require an extraneous agent, viz. heat, we reply that milk by itself also\nundergoes a certain amount of definite change, and that its turning is merely\naccelerated by heat. If milk did not possess that capability of itself, heat\ncould not compel it to turn; for we see that air or ether, for instance, is\nnot compelled by the action of heat to turn into sour milk. By the co-\noperation of auxiliary means the milk's capability of turning into sour milk\nis merely completed. The absolutely complete power of Brahman, on the other\nhand, does not require to be supplemented by any extraneous help. Thus\nScripture also declares, 'There is no effect and no instrument known of him,\nno one is seen like unto him or better; his high power is revealed as\nmanifold, as inherent, acting as force and knowledge' ( _S_ ve. Up. VI, 8).\nTherefore Brahman, although one only, is, owing to its manifold powers, able\nto transform itself into manifold effects; just as milk is.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1, 25](sbe34164.htm)\n\n"
