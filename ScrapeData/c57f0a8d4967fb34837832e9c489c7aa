Such qualities as having joy for its head, and so on, are not\nestablished, for if there were difference (of members) there would be increase\nand decrease.\n\nThe declaration that the essential qualities of Brahman are established for\nall meditations, does not imply that such attributes as 'having joy for its\nhead' are equally established. For the latter are not qualities of Brahman,\nsince they are mere elements in a figurative representation of Brahman under\nthe form of an animal body. Otherwise, i.e. if Brahman really possessed\ndifferent members, such as head, wings, and so on, it would be liable to\nincrease\n\np. 638\n\nand decrease, and this would be in conflict with texts such as 'the True,\nknowledge, infinite is Brahman.'--But if this reasoning holds good, then all\nthe infinite qualities belonging to Brahman such as lordly power, generosity,\ncompassion, and so on--all of which are incapable of existing apart from the\nsubject to which they belong-would have to be comprehended in all those\nmeditations on Brahman where they are not expressly mentioned; and this could\nnot possibly be done, as those qualities are infinite in number.--This\ndifficulty the next Sutra removes.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 13.
