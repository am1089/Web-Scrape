But I am so\nimpetuous by nature, a halting gait does not suit me. I knew I was overbold\nthat day. I knew that the first shock of such ideas is apt to be almost\nintolerable. But with women it is always audacity that wins.\n\nJust as we were getting on nicely, who should walk in but Nikhil\'s old tutor\nChandranath Babu. The world would have been not half a bad place to live in\nbut for these schoolmasters, who make one want to quit in disgust. The Nikhil\ntype wants to keep the world always a school. This incarnation of a school\nturned up that afternoon at the psychological moment.\n\nWe all remain schoolboys in some corner of our hearts, and I, even I, felt\nsomewhat pulled up. As for poor Bee, she at once took her place solemnly, like\nthe topmost girl of the class on the front bench. All of a sudden she seemed\nto remember that she had to face her examination.\n\nSome people are so like eternal pointsmen lying in wait by the line, to shunt\none\'s train of thought from one rail to another.\n\nChandranath Babu had no sooner come in than he cast about for some excuse to\nretire, mumbling: "I beg your pardon, I..."\n\nBefore he could finish, Bee went up to him and made a profound obeisance,\nsaying: "Pray do not leave us, sir. Will you not take a seat?" She looked like\na drowning person clutching at him for support--the little coward!\n\nBut possibly I was mistaken. It is quite likely that there was a touch of\nwomanly wile in it. She wanted, perhaps, to raise her value in my eyes. She\nmight have been pointedly saying to me: "Please don\'t imagine for a moment\nthat I am entirely overcome by you. My respect for Chandranath Babu is even\ngreater."\n\nWell, indulge in your respect by all means! Schoolmasters thrive on it. But\nnot being one of them, I have no use for that empty compliment.\n\nChandranath Babu began to talk about _Swadeshi_. I thought I would let him go\non with his monologues. There is nothing like letting an old man talk himself\nout. It makes him feel that he is winding up the world, forgetting all the\nwhile how far away the real world is from his wagging tongue.\n\nBut even my worst enemy would not accuse me of patience. And when Chandranath\nBabu went on to say: "If we expect to gather fruit where we have sown no seed,\nthen we ..." I had to interrupt him.\n\n"Who wants fruit?" I cried. "We go by the Author of the Gita who says that we\nare concerned only with the doing, not with the fruit of our deeds."\n\n"What is it then that you do want?" asked Chandranath Babu.\n\n"Thorns!" I exclaimed, "which cost nothing to plant."\n\n"Thorns do not obstruct others only," he replied. "They have a way of hurting\none\'s own feet."\n\n"That is all right for a copy-book," I retorted. "But the real thing is that\nwe have this burning at heart. Now we have only to cultivate thorns for\nothers\' soles; afterwards when they hurt us we shall find leisure to repent.\nBut why be frightened even of that? When at last we have to die it will be\ntime enough to get cold. While we are on fire let us seethe and boil."\n\nChandranath Babu smiled. "Seethe by all means," he said, "but do not mistake\nit for work, or heroism. Nations which have got on in the world have done so\nby action, not by ebullition. Those who have always lain in dread of work,\nwhen with a start they awake to their sorry plight, they look to short-cuts\nand scamping for their deliverance."\n\nI was girding up my loins to deliver a crushing reply, when Nikhil came back.\nChandranath Babu rose, and looking towards Bee, said: "Let me go now, my\nlittle mother, I have some work to attend to."\n\nAs he left, I showed Nikhil the book in my hand. "I was telling Queen Bee\nabout this book," I said.\n\nNinety-nine per cent of people have to be deluded with lies, but it is easier\nto delude this perpetual pupil of the schoolmaster with the truth. He is best\ncheated openly. So, in playing with him, the simplest course was to lay my\ncards on the table.\n\nNikhil read the title on the cover, but said nothing. "These writers," I\ncontinued, "are busy with their brooms, sweeping away the dust of epithets\nwith which men have covered up this world of ours. So, as I was saying, I wish\nyou would read it."\n\n"I have read it," said Nikhil.\n\n"Well, what do you say?"\n\n"It is all very well for those who really care to think, but poison for those\nwho shirk thought."\n\n"What do you mean?"\n\n"Those who preach \'Equal Rights of Property\' should not be thieves. For, if\nthey are, they would be preaching lies. When passion is in the ascendant, this\nkind of book is not rightly understood."\n\n"Passion," I replied, "is the street lamp which guides us. To call it untrue\nis as hopeless as to expect to see better by plucking out our natural eyes."\n\nNikhil was visibly growing excited. "I accept the truth of passion," he said,\n"only when I recognize the truth of restraint. By pressing what we want to see\nright into our eyes we only injure them: we do not see. So does the violence\nof passion, which would leave no space between the mind and its object, defeat\nits purpose."\n\n"It is simply your intellectual foppery," I replied, "which makes you indulge\nin moral delicacy, ignoring the savage side of truth. This merely helps you to\nmystify things, and so you fail to do your work with any degree of strength."\n\n"The intrusion of strength," said Nikhil impatiently, "where strength is out\nof place, does not help you in your work ... But why are we arguing about\nthese things? Vain arguments only brush off the fresh bloom of truth."\n\nI wanted Bee to join in the discussion, but she had not said a word up to now.\nCould I have given her too rude a shock, leaving her assailed with doubts and\nwanting to learn her lesson afresh from the schoolmaster? Still, a thorough\nshaking-up is essential. One must begin by realizing that things supposed to\nbe unshakeable can be shaken.\n\n"I am glad I had this talk with you," I said to Nikhil, "for I was on the\npoint of lending this book to Queen Bee to read."\n\n"What harm?" said Nikhil. "If I could read the book, why not Bimala too? All I\nwant to say is, that in Europe people look at everything from the viewpoint of\nscience. But man is neither mere physiology, nor biology, nor psychology, nor\neven sociology. For God\'s sake don\'t forget that. Man is infinitely more than\nthe natural science of himself. You laugh at me, calling me the schoolmaster\'s\npupil, but that is what you are, not I. You want to find the truth of man from\nyour science teachers, and not from your own inner being."\n\n"But why all this excitement?" I mocked.\n\n"Because I see you are bent on insulting man and making him petty."\n\n"Where on earth do you see all that?"\n\n"In the air, in my outraged feelings. You would go on wounding the great, the\nunselfish, the beautiful in man."\n\n"What mad idea is this of yours?"\n\nNikhil suddenly stood up. "I tell you plainly, Sandip," he said, "man may be\nwounded unto death, but he will not die. This is the reason why I am ready to\nsuffer all, knowing all, with eyes open."\n\nWith these words he hurriedly left the room.\n\nI was staring blankly at his retreating figure, when the sound of a book,\nfalling from the table, made me turn to find Bee following him with quick,\nnervous steps, making a detour to avoid passing too near me.\n\nA curious creature, that Nikhil! He feels the danger threatening his home, and\nyet why does he not turn me out? I know, he is waiting for Bimal to give him\nthe cue. If Bimal tells him that their mating has been a misfit, he will bow\nhis head and admit that it may have been a blunder! He has not the strength of\nmind to understand that to acknowledge a mistake is the greatest of all\nmistakes. He is a typical example of how ideas make for weakness. I have not\nseen another like him--so whimsical a product of nature! He would hardly do as\na character in a novel or drama, to say nothing of real life.\n\nAnd Bee? I am afraid her dream-life is over from today. She has at length\nunderstood the nature of the current which is bearing her along. Now she must\neither advance or retreat, open-eyed. The chances are she will now advance a\nstep, and then retreat a step. But that does not disturb me. When one is on\nfire, this rushing to and fro makes the blaze all the fiercer. The fright she\nhas got will only fan her passion.\n\nPerhaps I had better not say much to her, but simply select some modern books\nfor her to read. Let her gradually come to the conviction that to acknowledge\nand respect passion as the supreme reality, is to be modern--not to be ashamed\nof it, not to glorify restraint. If she finds shelter in some such word as\n"modern", she will find strength.\n\nBe that as it may, I must see this out to the end of the Fifth Act. I cannot,\nunfortunately, boast of being merely a spectator, seated in the royal box,\napplauding now and again. There is a wrench at my heart, a pang in every\nnerve. When I have put out the light and am in my bed, little touches, little\nglances, little words flit about and fill the darkness. When I get up in the\nmorning, I thrill with lively anticipations, my blood seems to course through\nme to the strains of music ...\n\nThere was a double photo-frame on the table with Bee\'s photograph by the side\nof Nikhil\'s. I had taken out hers. Yesterday I showed Bee the empty side and\nsaid: "Theft becomes necessary only because of miserliness, so its sin must be\ndivided between the miser and the thief. Do you not think so?"\n\n"It was not a good one," observed Bee simply, with a little smile.\n\n"What is to be done?" said I. "A portrait cannot be better than a portrait. I\nmust be content with it, such as it is."\n\nBee took up a book and began to turn over the pages. "If you are annoyed," I\nwent on, "I must make a shift to fill up the vacancy."\n\nToday I have filled it up. This photograph of mine was taken in my early\nyouth. My face was then fresher, and so was my mind. Then I still cherished\nsome illusions about this world and the next. Faith deceives men, but it has\none great merit: it imparts a radiance to the features.\n\nMy portrait now reposes next to Nikhil\'s, for are not the two of us old\nfriends?\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III](hw12.htm)\n\n'
