VII.\n\nKe\xc5\x9bidhwaja describes the nature of ignorance, and the benefits of the Yoga, or\ncontemplative devotion. Of the novice and the adept in the performance of the\nYoga. How it is performed. The first stage, proficiency in acts of restraint\nand moral duty: the second, particular mode of sitting: the third, Pranayama,\nmodes of breathing: the fourth, Pratyahara, restraint of thought: the fifth,\napprehension of spirit: the sixth, retention of the idea. Meditation on the\nindividual and universal forms of Vishn\xcc\x81u. Acquirement of knowledge. Final\nliberation.\n\n"BUT," said Ke\xc5\x9bidhwaja, "why have you not asked of me my kingdom, now free\nfrom all annoyance? what else except dominion is acceptable to the warrior\nrace?" "I will tell you," replied Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikya, "why I did not make such a\ndemand, nor require that territory which is an object of ignorant ambition. It\nis the duty of the warrior to protect his subjects in peace, and to kill in\nfight the enemies of his sway. It is no fault that you should have taken my\nkingdom from one who was unable to defend it, to whom it was a bondage, and\nwho was thus freed from the incumbrance of ignorance. My desire of dominion\noriginated in my being born to possess it: the ambition of others, which\nproceeds from human frailties, is not compatible with virtue. To solicit gifts\nis not the duty of a prince and warrior: and for these reasons I have not\nasked for your kingdom, nor made a demand which ignorance alone would have\nsuggested. Those only who are destitute of knowledge, whose minds are\nengrossed by selfishness, who are intoxicated with the inebriating beverage of\nself-sufficiency, desire kingdoms; not such as I am."\n\nWhen king Ke\xc5\x9bidhwaja heard these words, he was much pleased, and exclaimed,\n"It is well spoken!" Then addressing Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikya affectionately, he said,\n"Listen to my words. Through desire of escaping death by the ignorance of\nworks I exercise the regal power, celebrate various sacrifices, and enjoy\npleasures subversive of purity. Fortunate is it for you that your mind has\nattached itself to the dominion of discrimination. Pride of your race! now\nlisten to the real nature of ignorance. The (erroneous) notion that self\nconsists in what is not self, and the\n\np. 650\n\nopinion that property consists in what is not one\'s own, constitute the double\nseed of the tree of ignorance. The ill judging embodied being, bewildered by\nthe darkness of fascination, situated in a body composed of the five elements,\nloudly asserts, \'This is I:\' but who would ascribe spiritual individuality to\na body in which soul is distinct from the ether, air, fire, water, and earth\n(of which that body is composed) 1? What man of understanding assigns to\ndisembodied spirit corporeal fruition, or lands, houses, and the like, that it\nshould say, \'These are mine?\' What wise man entertains the idea of property in\nsous or grandsons begotten of the body after the spirit has abandoned it? Man\nperforms all acts for the purpose of bodily fruition, and the consequence of\nsuch acts is another body; so that their result is nothing but confinement to\nbodily existence. In the same manner as a mansion of clay is plastered with\nclay and water, so the body, which is of earth, is perpetuated by earth and\nwater (or by eating and drinking). The body, consisting of the five elements,\nis nourished by substances equally composed of those elements: but since this\nis the case, what is there in this life that man should be proud of?\nTravelling the path of the world for many thousands of births, man attains\nonly the weariness of bewilderment, and is smothered by the dust of\nimagination. When that dust is washed away by the bland water of real\nknowledge, then the weariness of bewilderment sustained by the wayfarer\nthrough repeated births is removed. When that weariness is relieved, the\ninternal man is at peace, and he obtains that supreme felicity which is\nunequalled and undisturbed. This soul is (of its own nature) pure, and\ncomposed of happiness and wisdom. The properties of pain, ignorance, and\nimpurity, are those of nature (Prakriti), not of soul. There is no affinity\nbetween fire and water, but when the latter is placed over the former in a\ncaldron it bubbles and boils, and\n\np. 651\n\nexhibits the properties of fire. In like manner, when soul is associated with\nPrakriti it is vitiated by egotism and the rest, and assumes the qualities of\ngrosser nature, although essentially distinct from them, and incorruptible.\nSuch is the seed of ignorance, as I have explained it to you. There is but one\ncure of worldly sorrows, the practice of devotion; no other is known."\n\n"Then," said Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikya, "do you, who are the chief of those versed in\ncontemplative devotion, explain to me what that is; for in the race of the\ndescendants of Nimi 2 you are best acquainted with the sacred writings in\nwhich it is taught." "Hear," replied Ke\xc5\x9bidhwaja, "the account of, the nature\nof contemplative devotion 3, which I impart to you, and by perfection in which\nthe sage attains resolution into Brahma, and never suffers birth again. The\nmind of man is the cause both of his bondage and his liberation: its addiction\nto the objects of sense is the means of his bondage; its separation from\nobjects of sense is the means of his freedom. The sage who is capable of\ndiscriminative knowledge must therefore restrain his mind from all the objects\nof sense, and therewith meditate upon the supreme being, who is one with\nspirit, in order to attain liberation; for that supreme spirit attracts to\nitself him who meditates upon it, and who is of the same nature, as the\nloadstone attracts the iron by the virtue which is common to itself and to its\nproducts 4.\n\np. 652\n\n[paragraph continues] Contemplative devotion is the union with Brahma,\neffected by that condition of mind which has attained perfection through those\nexercises which complete the control of self 5: and he whose contemplative\ndevotion is characterized by the property of such absolute perfection, is in\ntruth a sage, expectant of final liberation from the world.\n\n"The sage, or Yogi, when first applying himself to contemplative devotion is\ncalled the novice or practitioner (Yoga yuj); when he has attained spiritual\nunion he is termed the adept, or he whose meditations are accomplished 6.\nShould the thoughts of the former be unvitiated by any obstructing\nimperfection, he will obtain freedom, after practising devotion through\nseveral lives 7. The latter speedily obtains liberation in that existence (in\nwhich he reaches perfection), all his acts being consumed by the fire of\ncontemplative devotion. The sage who would bring his mind into a fit state for\nthe performance of devout contemplation\n\np. 653\n\nmust be devoid of desire, and observe invariably continence, compassion,\ntruth, honesty, and disinterestedness: he must fix his mind intently on the\nsupreme Brahma, practising holy study, purification, contentment, penance, and\nself-control. These virtues, respectively termed the five acts of restraint\n(Yana), and five of obligation (Niyama), bestow excellent rewards when\npractised for the sake of reward, and eternal liberation when they are not\nprompted by desire (of transient benefits). Endowed with these merits, the\nsage self restrained should sit in one of the modes termed Bhadrasana, &c.,\nand engage in contemplation 8. Bringing his vital airs, called Pran\xcc\x81a, under\nsubjection, by frequent repetition, is thence called Pran\xcc\x81ayama, which is as\nit were a seed with a seed 9. In this the breath of expiration and that of\ninspiration are alternately obstructed, constituting the act twofold; and the\nsuppression of both modes of breathing produces a third 10. The exercise of\nthe Yogi, whilst endeavouring to bring before his thoughts the gross form of\nthe eternal, is denominated \xc3\x81lambana 11. He is then to perform the Pratyahara,\nwhich consists in restraining his organs of sense from susceptibility to\noutward impressions, and directing them entirely to mental perceptions. By\nthese means the entire subjugation of the unsteady senses is effected; and if\nthey are not controlled, the sage will not accomplish his devotions. When by\nthe Pran\xcc\x81ayama the vital airs\n\np. 654\n\nare restrained, and the senses are subjugated by the Pratyahara, then the sage\nwill he able to keep his mind steady in its perfect asylum."\n\nKhan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikya then said to Ke\xc5\x9bidhwaja, "Illustrious sage, inform me what is that\nperfect asylum of the mind, resting on which it destroys all the products of\n(human) infirmity." To this, Ke\xc5\x9bidhwaja replied, "The asylum of mind is spirit\n(Brahma), which of its own nature is twofold, as being with or without form;\nand each of these is supreme and secondary 12. Apprehension of spirit 13,\nagain, is threefold. I will explain the different kinds to you: they are, that\nwhich is called Brahma, that which is named from works, and that which\ncomprehends both. That mental apprehension which consists of Brahma is one;\nthat which is formed of works is another; and that which comprehends both is\nthe third: so that mental apprehension (of the object or asylum of the\nthoughts) is threefold. Sanandana and other (perfect sages) were endowed with\napprehension of the nature of Brahma. The gods and others, whether animate or\ninanimate, are possessed of that which regards acts. The apprehension that\ncomprehends both works and spirit exists in Hiran\xcc\x81yagarbha and others, who are\npossessed of contemplative knowledge of their own nature, and who also\nexercise certain active functions, as creation and the rest. Until all acts,\nwhich are the causes of notions of individuality, are discontinued, spirit is\none thing, and the universe is another, to those who contemplate objects as\ndistinct and various; but that is called true knowledge, or knowledge of\nBrahma, which recognises no distinctions, which contemplates only simple\nexistence, which is\n\np. 655\n\nundefinable by words, and is to be discovered solely in one\'s own spirit. That\nis the supreme, unborn, imperishable form of Vishn\xcc\x81u, who is without\n(sensible) form, and is characterised as a condition of the supreme soul,\nwhich is variously modified from the condition of universal form. But this\ncondition cannot be contemplated by sages in their (early) devotions, and they\nmust therefore direct their minds to the gross form of Hari, which is of\nuniversal perceptibility. They must meditate upon him as Hiran\xcc\x81yagarbha, as\nthe glorious Vasava, as Prajapati, as the winds, the Vasus, the Rudras, the\nsuns, stars, planets, Gandharbas, Yakshas, Daityas, all the gods and their\nprogenitors, men, animals, mountains, oceans, rivers, trees, all beings, and\nall sources of beings, all modifications whatever of nature and its products,\nwhether sentient or unconscious, one-footed, two-footed, or many-footed; all\nthese are the sensible form of Hari, to be apprehended by the three kinds of\napprehension. All this universal world, this world of moving and stationary\nbeings, is pervaded by the energy of Vishn\xcc\x81u, who is of the nature of the\nsupreme Brahma. This energy is either supreme, or, when it is that of\nconscious embodied spirit, it is secondary. Ignorance, or that which is\ndenominated from works, is a third energy 14; by which the omnipresent energy\nof embodied spirit is ever excited, and whence it suffers all the pains of\nrepeated worldly existence. Obscured by that energy (of ignorance or\nillusion), the energy that is denominated from embodied spirit is\ncharacterised by different degrees of perfection in all created beings. In\nthings without life it exists in a very small degree: it is more in things\nthat have life, but are (without motion): in insects it is still more\nabundant, and still more in birds; it is more in wild animals, and in domestic\nanimals the faculty is still greater: men have more of this (spiritual).\nfaculty than animals, and thence arises their authority over\n\np. 656\n\nthem: the faculty exists in an ascending degree in Nagas, Gandharbas, Yakshas,\ngods, \xc5\x9aakra, Prajapati, and Hiran\xcc\x81yagarbha: and is above all predominant in\nthat male (Vishn\xcc\x81u) of whom all these various creatures are but the\ndiversified forms, penetrated universally by his energy, as all-pervading as\nthe ether.\n\n"The second 15 state of him who is called Vishn\xcc\x81u, and which is to be\nmeditated upon by the (advanced) sage, is that imperceptible, shapeless form\nof Brahma, which is called by the wise, \'That which is 16,\' and in which all\nthe before described energies reside. Thence proceeds the form of the\nuniversal form, the other great form of Hari, which is the origin of those\nmanifested forms (or incarnations) that are endowed with every kind of energy,\nand which, whether the forms of gods, animals, or men, are assumed by him\n(Hari) in his sport. This active interposition of the undefinable god, all-\ncomprehending and irresistible, is for the purpose of benefiting the world,\nand is not the necessary consequence of works. This form of the universal form\nis to be meditated upon by the sage for the object of purification, as it\ndestroys all sin. In the same manner as fire, blazing in the wind, burns dry\ngrass, so Vishn\xcc\x81u, seated in the heart, consumes the sins of the sage; and\ntherefore let him resolutely effect the fixation of his mind upon that\nreceptacle of all the three energies (Vishn\xcc\x81u), for that is the operation of\nthe mind which is called perfect Dharana 17: and thus the perfect asylum of\nindividual as well as universal spirit, that which is beyond the three modes\nof apprehension, is attained, for the eternal emancipation of the sage. The\nminds of other beings, which are not fixed upon that asylum, are altogether\nimpure, and are all the gods and the rest, who spring from acts. The retention\nor apprehension by the mind of that visible form of Vishn\xcc\x81u, without regard to\nsubsidiary forms, is thence called Dharana; and I will describe to you the\nperceptible form of Hari, which no mental retention\n\np. 657\n\nwill manifest, except in a mind that is fit to become the receptacle of the\nidea 18. The meditating sage must think (he beholds internally the figure) of\nVishn\xcc\x81u, as having a pleased and lovely countenance, with eyes like the leaf\nof the lotus, smooth cheeks, and a broad and brilliant forehead; ears of equal\nsize, the lobes of which are decorated with splendid pendants; a painted neck,\nand a broad breast, on which shines the Srivatsa mark; a belly falling in\ngraceful folds, with a deep-seated navel; eight long arms, or else four; and\nfirm and well-knit thighs and legs, with well-formed feet and toes. Let him,\nwith well-governed thoughts, contemplate, as long as he can persevere in\nunremitting attention, Hari as clad in a yellow robe, wearing a rich diadem on\nhis head, and brilliant armlets and bracelets on his arms, and bearing in his\nhands the bow, the shell, the mace, the sword, the discus, the rosary, the\nlotus, and the arrow 19. When this image never departs from his mind, whether\nhe be going or standing, or be engaged in any other voluntary act, then he may\nbelieve his retention to be perfect. The sage may then meditate upon the form\nof Vishn\xcc\x81u without his arms, as the shell, mace, discus, and bow; and as\nplacid, and bearing only his rosary. When the idea of this image is firmly\nretained, then he may meditate on Vishn\xcc\x81u without his diadem, bracelets, or\nother ornaments. He may next contemplate him as having but one single limb,\nand may then fix his whole thoughts upon the body to which the limbs belong.\nThis process of forming a lively image in the mind, exclusive of all other\nobjects, constitutes Dhyana, or meditation, which is perfected by six stages\n20; and when an accurate knowledge of self, free from all distinction, is\nattained by this mental meditation, that is termed Samadhi 21.\n\np. 658\n\n"(When the Yogi has accomplished this stage, he acquires) discriminative\nknowledge, which is the means of enabling living soul, when all the three\nkinds of apprehension are destroyed, to attain the attainable supreme Brahma\n22. Embodied spirit is the user of the instrument, which instrument is true\nknowledge; and by it that (identification) of the former (with Brahma) is\nattained 23. Liberation, which is the object to be effected, being\naccomplished, discriminative knowledge ceases. When endowed with the\napprehension of the nature of the object of inquiry, then, there is no\ndifference between it (individual and) supreme spirit: difference is the\nconsequence of the absence of (true) knowledge. When that ignorance which is\nthe cause of the difference between individual and universal spirit is\ndestroyed finally and for ever, who shall ever make that distinction between\nthem which does not exist? Thus have I, Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikya, in reply to your\nquestion, explained to you what is meant by contemplative devotion, both fully\nand summarily. What else do you wish to hear?"\n\nKhan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikya replied to Ke\xc5\x9bidhwaja, and said, "The explanation which you have\ngiven me of the real nature of contemplative devotion has fulfilled all my\nwishes, and removed all impurity from my mind. The expression \'mine,\' which I\nhave been accustomed to use, is untruth, and\n\np. 659\n\ncannot be otherwise declared by those who know what is to be known. The words\n\'I\' and \'mine\' constitute ignorance; but practice is influenced by ignorance.\nSupreme truth cannot be defined, for it is not to be explained by words.\nDepart therefore, Ke\xc5\x9bidhwaja; you have done all that is necessary for my real\nhappiness, in teaching me contemplative devotion, the inexhaustible bestower\nof liberation from existence."\n\nAccordingly king Ke\xc5\x9bidhwaja, after receiving suitable homage from Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikya,\nreturned to his city. Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikya, having nominated his son Raja 24, retired\nto the woods to accomplish his devotions, his whole mind being intent upon\nGovinda: there his entire thoughts being engrossed upon one only object, and\nbeing purified by practices of restraint, self-control, and the rest, he\nobtained absorption into the pure and perfect spirit which is termed Vishn\xcc\x81u.\nKe\xc5\x9bidhwaja also, in order to attain liberation, became averse from his own\nperishable works, and lived amidst objects of sense (without regarding them),\nand instituted religious rites without expecting therefrom any advantages to\nhimself. Thus by pure and auspicious fruition, being cleansed from all sin,\nthe also obtained that perfection which assuages all affliction for ever.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[650:1](vp162.htm#fr_1636) The text is somewhat obscure, but it is in some\ndegree cleared up by the next illustration. No one would think of applying the\nproperty of self--the idea of possession or personality--to soul, separated\nfrom body: but the objection is equally applicable to soul in the body; for\nwhilst there it is as distinct in its nature from the materials of body as if\nit was disembodied, and quite as incapable of individual personal fruition.\n\n[651:2](vp162.htm#fr_1637) That is, in the race of princes of Mithila.\n\n[651:3](vp162.htm#fr_1638) The term Yoga, which is that used in the text, in\nits literal acceptation signifies \'union,\' \'junction,\' from ### \'to join:\' in\na spiritual sense it denotes \'union of separated with universal soul; and with\nsome latitude of expression it comes to signify the means by which such union\nis affected. In the Bhagavad Gita it is variously applied, but ordinarily\ndenotes the performance of religious ceremonies as a duty, and not for\ninterested purposes. Thus Krishn\xcc\x81a says to Arjuna, "Engaging in Yoga, perform\nrites, Dhananjaya, being indifferent to success or failure: such indifference\nis called Yoga." II. v. 48. It is elsewhere defined, \'exemption from the\ncontact of pain:\' VI. v. 23. The word has been accordingly rendered \'devotion\'\nby Wilkins, and \'devotio\' by Schlegel, in their translations of the Gita. In\nthis place, however, it is used in a less general sense, and signifies, as is\nsubsequently explained, reunion with spirit through the exercises necessary to\nperfect abstraction as they are taught and practised by the followers of\nPatanjali.\n\n[651:4](vp162.htm#fr_1639) This illustration is however only to a p. 652\nlimited extent, explanatory of the nature of Yoga; for though the loadstone\nand iron unite, by virtue of a community of kind, yet the union that takes\nplace is only that of contiguity, Samyoga not that of identification or unity,\nTadaikyam. Some further explanation therefore is required.\n\n[652:5](vp162.htm#fr_1640) The first stage is the \xc3\x81tma prayatna, the practice\nof moral and religious restraint, Yama, Niyama, &c. When the novice is perfect\nin these, then he is fit to attain the perfectibility of an adept, through the\nespecial practices which treatises on the Yoga prescribe. When the mind has\nattained the state which can alone be attained through them, then the union\nwith Brahma, which is the consequence, is called Yoga: ###. The \xc3\x81tma prayatna\nis defined to be that which has Yama, &c. for its object. The next phrase is\nexplained, \'depending upon, or relating to, such control.\' ### is the same as\n### condition or state of mind which is ### perfected: of that state of mind,\nunion with Brahma, is Yoga. Union with Brahma is the abstraction that proposes\nthe identity of the living with the supreme spirit of the Jivatma, with\nBrahma; and Yoga is understanding of the identity of the contemplator and the\nobject contemplated. A text of Yajnyawalkya is quoted to this effect: \'Know\nholy wisdom to be the same with Yoga, (the practice of) which has eight\ndivisions. That which is termed Yoga is union of the living with the supreme\nsoul.\'\n\n[652:6](vp162.htm#fr_1641) Vinishpannasamadhi is the expression of the text,\nwhich can scarcely be regarded as an appellative. The commentator terms the\nadept Brahmajnani, \'He who knows Brahma.\'\n\n[652:7](vp162.htm#fr_1642) After three lives, according to the Vayu Sanhita,\nas quoted in the comment.\n\n[653:8](vp162.htm#fr_1643) There are various postures in which the Yogi is\ndirected to sit when he engages in meditation. In the Bhadrasana he is\ndirected to cross his legs underneath him, and to lay hold of his feet on each\nside with his hands.\n\n[653:9](vp162.htm#fr_1644) It is itself figuratively the seed of the fruit,\nwhich is meditation; but it is to be accompanied with what is also technically\ncalled Bija, or seed, inaudible repetition of certain prayers, and meditation\non the visible form of the deity, termed likewise \xc3\x81lambana, and presently\nmentioned.\n\n[653:10](vp162.htm#fr_1645) Pran\xcc\x81ayama is performed by three modifications of\nbreathing: the first act is expiration, which is performed through the right\nnostril, whilst the left is closed with the fingers of the right hand; this is\ncalled Rechaka: the thumb is then placed upon the right nostril, and the\nfingers raised from the left, through which breath is inhaled; this is called\nPuraka: in the third act both nostrils are closed, and breathing suspended;\nthis is Kumbhaka: and a succession of these operations is the practice of\nPran\xcc\x81ayama.\n\n[653:11](vp162.htm#fr_1646) \xc3\x81lambana is the silent repetition of prayer.\n\n[654:12](vp162.htm#fr_1647) The Brahma that is without form (Amurtta) may be\nPara or Apara. Supreme formless spirit is, without attributes of any kind.\nSecondary formless spirit is invested with the attributes of power, glory,\ntruth, perfection. Spirit embodied, or with form in his highest state, is,\naccording to our text, Vishn\xcc\x81u, and his manifestations. Spirit in an inferior\nor secondary series of bodily forms is Brahma and all other living beings.\n\n[654:13](vp162.htm#fr_1648) The term is Bhavana, defined to be, \'function to\nbe engendered by knowledge;\' the mental impression or apprehension following\nupon knowledge.\' Here it implies in particular the formation of a fixed idea\nby the Yogi of the object of his contemplations. It is also termed Bhava-\nbhavana, \'apprehension of the being, the existence, or substantiality, of the\nobject; the thing contemplated.\'\n\n[655:14](vp162.htm#fr_1649) The term used throughout is \xc5\x9aakti, power,\'\n\'ability,\' \'energy\' By the first kind, or Para, is understood knowledge able\nto appreciate abstract truth, or the nature of universal soul; by the second,\nability to understand the nature of embodied soul; and by the third, inability\nto discern one\'s own nature, and reliance on moral or ceremonial merit. These\ndifferent kinds are called energies, because they are the energies or\nfaculties of the supreme spirit, or, according to the Vaishn\xcc\x81avas, of Vishn\xcc\x81u,\naccompanying soul in all its various conditions of existence.\n\n[656:15](vp162.htm#fr_1650) The first, which has been intended to be described\nin the foregoing passages, was the universal, visible form of Vishn\xcc\x81u; the\nsecond is his formless or imperceptible condition.\n\n[656:16](vp162.htm#fr_1651) Sat \'what is being.\'\n\n[656:17](vp162.htm#fr_1652) Retention, or holding of the image or idea formed\nin the mind by contemplation: from Dhri, \'to hold,\' literally or figuratively.\n\n[657:18](vp162.htm#fr_1653) The explanation of Dharan\xcc\x81a given in the text is\nrendered unnecessarily perplexed by the double doctrine here taught, and the\nattempt to combine the abstractions of Yoga theism with the sectarian worship\nof Vishn\xcc\x81u.\n\n[657:19](vp162.htm#fr_1654) The two last implements are from the comment; the\ntext specifies only six.\n\n[657:20](vp162.htm#fr_1655) They are, 1. Yama &c., acts of restraint and\nobligation; 2. \xc3\x81sana, sitting in particular postures; 3. Pran\xcc\x81ayama, modes of\nbreathing; 4. Pratyahara, exclusion of all external ideas; 5. Bhavana,\napprehension of internal ideas; 6. Dharan\xcc\x81a, fixation or retention of those\nideas.\n\n[657:21](vp162.htm#fr_1656) The result of the Dhyana or Samadhi is the absence\nof all idea of individuality, when the meditator, the meditation, and p. 658\nthe thing or object meditated upon, are all considered to be but one.\nAccording to the text of Patanjali: \'Restraint of the body, retention of the\nmind, and meditation, which thence is exclusively confined to one object, is\nDhyana: the idea of identification with the object of such meditation, so as\nif devoid of individual nature, is Samadhi.\'\n\n[658:22](vp162.htm#fr_1657) The expressions of the text are somewhat obscure,\nnor does the commentator make them much more intelligible, until he cuts the\nmatter short by stating the meaning to be, that \'discriminative knowledge\nenables the living spirit to attain Brahma.\'\n\n[658:23](vp162.htm#fr_1658) The text is very elliptical and obscure. Having\nstated that embodied spirit (Kshetrajna) is the Karan\xcc\x81in, the possessor or\nuser of the Karana, which is knowledge, it adds, ### literally, \'by that, of\nthat, that;\' i. e. Tat, \'that which is; and Brahma, or supreme spirit, is the\nattainment of that spirit which abides in body by that instrument, or\ndiscriminative knowledge, of which it has become possessed through perfect\nmeditation.\n\n[659:24](vp162.htm#fr_1659) The commentator, in order to explain how\nKhan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikya should have given what he did not possess, states that it is to be\nunderstood that Ke\xc5\x9bidhwaja relinquished to him the kingdom; or the term Raja\nmay denote merely, master of, or acquainted with, mystic prayers, or Mantras.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VIII](vp163.htm)\n\n'
