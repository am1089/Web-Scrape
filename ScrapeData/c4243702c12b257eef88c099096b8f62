I pray;  \nAnd dost thou win by virtuous sway  \nThy people's love, discharging all  \nThe duties on a king that fall?  \nAre all thy servants fostered well?  \nDo all obey, and none rebel?  \nHast thou, destroyer of the foe,  \nNo enemies to overthrow?  \nDoes fortune, conqueror! still attend  \nThy treasure, host, and every friend!  \nIs it all well? Does happy fate  \nOn sons and children's children wait!'  \n\n   He spoke. The modest king replied  \nThat all was prosperous far and wide.  \n\np. 64  \n\nThus for awhile the two conversed,  \nAs each to each his tale rehearsed,  \nAnd as the happy moments flew,  \nTheir joy and friendship stronger grew.  \nWhen such discourse had reached an end,  \nThus spoke the saint most reverend  \nTo royal Vis'vamitra, while  \nHis features brightened with a smile:  \n'O mighty lord of men. I fain  \nWould banquet thee and all thy train  \nIn mode that suits thy station high:  \nAnd do not thou my prayer deny.  \nLet my good lord with favour take  \nThe offering that I fain would make,  \nAnd let me honour, ere we part.  \nMy royal guest with loving heart.'  \n\nHim Vis'vamitra thus addressed:  \n'Why make, O Saint, this new request?  \nThy welcome and each gracious word  \nSufficient honour have conferred.  \nThou gavest roots and fruit to eat,  \nThe treasures of this pure retreat,  \nAnd water for my mouth and feet;  \nAnd--boon I prize above the rest--  \nThy presence has mine eyesight blest.  \nHonoured by thee in every way,  \nTo whom all honour all should pay,  \nI now will go. My lord, Good-bye!  \nRegard me with a friendly eye.'  \n\nHim speaking thus Vas'ishtha stayed,  \nAnd still to share his banquet prayed.  \nThe will of Gadhi's son he bent,  \nAnd won the monarch to consent,  \nWho spoke in answer. 'Let it be,  \nGreat Hermit, as it pleases thee.'  \nWhen, best of those who breathe the prayer,  \nHe heard the king his will declare,  \nHe called the cow of spotted skin,  \nAll spot without, all pure within.  \n'Come, Dapple-skin,' he cried, 'with speed;  \nHear thou my words and help at need.  \nMy heart is set to entertain  \nThis monarch and his mighty train  \nWith sumptuous meal and worthy fare;  \nBe thine the banquet to prepare.  \nEach dainty cute, each goodly dish,  \nOf six-fold taste 1 as each may wish--  \nAll these, O cow of heavenly power,  \nRain down for me in copious shower:  \nViands and drink for tooth and lip,  \nTo eat, to suck, to quaff, to sip--  \nOf these sufficient, and to spare,  \nO plenty-giving cow, prepare.'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[63:1](ry051.htm#fr_220) Divine personages of minute size produced from the\nhair of Brahma, and probably the origin of\n\n  \n            'That small infantry  \n   Warred on by cranes.'  \n\n[64:1](ry052.htm#fr_221) Sweet, salt, pungent, bitter, acid, and astringent.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LIII.: Vis'vamitra's Request.](ry053.htm)\n\n"
