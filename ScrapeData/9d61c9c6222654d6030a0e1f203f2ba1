On account of his being designated as the object of seeing, he (i.e. the\nhighest Self) (is that object).\n\nThe followers of the Atharva-veda, in the section containing the question\nasked by Satyakama, read as follows: 'He again who meditates with this\nsyllable Aum of three Matras on the highest Person, he comes to light and to\nthe sun. As a snake frees itself from its skin, so he frees himself from evil.\nHe is led up by the Saman verses to the Brahma-world; he sees the person\ndwelling in the castle who is higher than the individual souls concreted\n\np. 312\n\nwith bodies and higher (than those)' (Pra. Up. V, 2). Here the terms 'he\nmeditates' and 'he sees' have the same sense, 'seeing' being the result of\ndevout meditation; for according to the principle expressed in the text (\n_Kh_. Up. III, 14) 'According as man's thought is in this world,' what is\nreached by the devotee is the object of meditation; and moreover the text\nexhibits the same object, viz. 'the highest Person' in connexion with both\nverbs.\n\nThe doubt here presents itself whether the highest Person in this text be the\nso-called four-faced Brahma, the Lord of the mundane egg who represents the\nindividual souls in their collective aspect, or the supreme Person who is the\nLord of all.--The Purvapakshin maintains the former view. For, he argues, on\nthe introductory question, 'He who here among men should meditate until death\non the syllable Om, what would he obtain by it?' The text first declares that\nhe who meditates on that syllable as having one Matra, obtains the world of\nmen; and next, that he who meditates on it as having two Matras obtains the\nworld of the atmosphere. Hence the Brahma-world, which the text after that\nrepresents as the object reached by him who meditates on Om as having three\nsyllables, must be the world of Brahma _K_ aturmukha who is constituted by the\naggregate of the individual souls. What the soul having reached that world\nsees, therefore is the same Brahma _K_ aturmukha; and thus only the attribute\n'etasma _g_ ' _g_ ivaghanat parat param' is suitable; for the collective soul,\ni. e. Brahma _K_ aturmukha, residing in the Brahma-world is higher (para) than\nthe distributive or discrete soul ( _g_ iva) which is concreted (ghani-bhuta)\nwith the body and sense-organs, and at the same time is higher (para) than\nthese. The highest Person mentioned in the text, therefore, is Brahmaa _K_\naturmukha; and the qualities mentioned further on, such as absence of decay,\n&c., must be taken in such a way as to agree with that Brahma.\n\nTo this prima facie view the Sutra replies that the object of seeing is He,\ni.e. the highest Self, on account of designation. The text clearly designates\nthe object of seeing as the highest Self. For the concluding _s_ loka,\n\np. 313\n\nwhich refers to that object of seeing, declares that 'by means of the O _m_\nkara he who knows reaches that which is tranquil, free from decay, immortal,\nfearless, the highest'--all which attributes properly belong to the highest\nSelf only, as we know from texts such as 'that is the Immortal, that is the\nfearless, that is Brahman' ( _Kh_. Up. IV, 15, i). The qualification expressed\nin the clause 'etasma _g g_ iva.--ghanat,' &c. may also refer to the highest\nSelf only, not to Brahma _K_ aturmukha; for the latter is himself comprehended\nby the term ' _g_ ivaghana.' For that term denotes all souls which are\nembodied owing to karman; and that _K_ aturmukha is one of those we know from\ntexts such as 'He who first creates Brahma' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 18). Nor is\nthere any strength in the argument that, since the Brahma-world mentioned in\nthe text is known to be the world of _K_ aturmukha, as it follows next on the\nworld of the atmosphere, the being abiding there must needs be _K_ aturmukha.\nWe rather argue as follows--as from the concluding clause 'that which is\ntranquil, free from decay,' &c., we ascertain that the object of intuition is\nthe highest Brahman, the Brahma-world spoken of as the abode of the seeing\ndevotee cannot be the perishable world of Brahma _K_ aturmukha. A further\nreason for this conclusion is supplied by what the text says about 'him who is\nfreed from all evil being led up by the Saman verses to the world of Brahman';\nfor the place reached by him who is freed from all evil cannot be the mere\nabode of _K_ aturmukha. Hence also the concluding _s_ loka says with reference\nto that Brahma-world 'that which the wise teach ': what the wise see and teach\nis the abode of the highest, of Vish _n_ u; cp. the text 'the wise ever see\nthat highest abode of Vish _n_ u.' Nor is it even strictly true that the world\nof Brahma follows on the atmosphere, for the svarga-world and several others\nlie between the two.\n\nWe therefore shortly explain the drift of the whole chapter as follows. At the\noutset of the reply given to Satyakama there is mentioned, in addition to the\nhighest (para) Brahman, a lower (apara) Brahman. This lower or effected\n(karya) Brahman is distinguished as twofold, being connected either with this\nterrestrial world or yonder, non-terrestrial,\n\np. 314\n\nworld. Him who meditates on the Pra _n_ ava as having one syllable, the text\ndeclares to obtain a reward in this world--he reaches the world of men. He, on\nthe other hand, who meditates on the Pra _n_ ava as having two syllables is\nsaid to obtain his reward in a super-terrestrial sphere--he reaches the world\nof the atmosphere. And he finally who, by means of the trisyllabic Pra _n_ ava\nwhich denotes the highest Brahman, meditates on this very highest Brahman, is\nsaid to reach that Brahman, i. e. the supreme Person.--The object of seeing is\nthus none other than the highest Self.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of\nthe 'object of seeing.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 13.
