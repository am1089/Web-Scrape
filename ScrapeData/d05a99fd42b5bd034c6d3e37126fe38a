The waters desired, 'How can we be reproduced?' They toiled and\nperformed fervid devotions 1, when they were becoming heated, a golden egg was\nproduced. The year, indeed, was not then in existence: this golden egg floated\nabout for as long as the space of a year.\n\n11:1:6:22\\. In a year's time a man, this Pra _g_ apati, was produced\ntherefrom; and hence a woman, a cow, or a mare brings forth within the space\nof a year; for Pra _g_ apati was born in a year. He broke open this golden\negg. There was then, indeed, no resting-place: only this golden egg, bearing\nhim, floated about for as long as the space of a year.\n\n11:1:6:33\\. At the end of a year he tried to speak. He said 'bhu _h_ ': this\n(word) became this earth;--'bhuva _h_ ': this became this air;--'sva _h_ ':\nthis became yonder sky. Therefore a child tries to\n\np. 13\n\nspeak at the end of a year, for at the end of a year Pra _g_ apati tried to\nspeak.\n\n11:1:6:44\\. When he was first speaking Pra _g_ apati spoke (words) of one\nsyllable and of two syllables; whence a child, when first speaking, speaks\n(words) of one syllable and of two syllables.\n\n11:1:6:55\\. These (three words consist of), five syllables: he made them to be\nthe five seasons, and thus there are these five seasons. At the end of the\n(first) year, Pra _g_ apati rose to stand on these worlds thus produced;\nwhence a child tries to stand up at the end of a year, for at the end of a\nyear Pra _g_ apati stood up.\n\n11:1:6:66\\. He was born with a life of a thousand years: even as one might see\nin the distance the opposite shore, so did he behold the opposite shore (the\nend) of his own life.\n\n11:1:6:77\\. Desirous of offspring, he went on singing praises and toiling. He\nlaid the power of reproduction into his own self. By (the breath of) his mouth\nhe created the gods: the gods were created on entering the sky; and this is\nthe godhead of the gods (deva) that they were created on entering the sky\n(div). Having created them, there was, as it were, daylight for him; and this\nalso is the godhead of the gods that, after creating them, there was, as it\nwere, daylight (diva) for him.\n\n11:1:6:88\\. And by the downward breathing he created the Asuras: they were\ncreated on entering this earth. Having created them there was, as it were,\ndarkness for him.\n\n11:1:6:99\\. He knew, 'Verily, I have created evil for myself since, after\ncreating, there has come to be, as it were, darkness for me.' Even then he\nsmote\n\np. 14\n\nthem with evil, and owing to this it was that they were overcome; whence\npeople say, 'Not true is that regarding (the fight between) the gods and\nAsuras which is related partly in the tale and partly in the legend; for it\nwas even then that Pra _g_ apati smote them with evil, and it was owing to\nthis that they were overcome.'\n\n11:1:6:1010\\. Therefore it is with reference to this that the _Ri_ shi has\nsaid, 'Not for a single day hast thou fought, nor hast thou any enemy, O\nMaghavan illusion is what they say concerning thy battles; no foe hast thou\nfought either to-day or aforetime.'\n\n11:1:6:1111\\. Now what daylight, as it were, there was for him, on creating\nthe gods, of that he made the day; and what darkness, as it were, there was\nfor him, on creating the Asuras, of that he made the night: they are these\ntwo, day and night.\n\n11:1:6:1212\\. Pra _g_ apati bethought himself, 'Everything (sarva), indeed, I\nhave obtained by stealth (tsar) who have created these deities:' this became\nthe 'sarvatsara,' for 'sarvatsara,' doubtless, is the same as 'sa _m_ vatsara\n(year).' And, verily, whosoever thus knows 'sa _m_ vatsara' to be the same as\n'sarvatsara 1,' is not overcome by any evil which, by magic art, steals upon\nhim (tsar); and whosoever thus knows 'sa _m_ vatsara' to be the same as\n'sarvatsara,' overcomes against whomsoever he practises magic art.\n\n11:1:6:1313\\. Pra _g_ apati bethought himself, 'Verily, I have created here a\ncounterpart of myself, to wit, the year;' whence they say, 'Pra _g_ apati is\nthe year;' for he created it to be a counterpart of himself:\n\np. 15\n\ninasmuch as 'sa _m_ vatsara (year),' as well as 'Pra _g_ apati,' consists of\nfour syllables, thereby it (the year) is a counterpart of him.\n\n11:1:6:1414\\. Now, these are the deities who were created out of Pra _g_\napati,--Agni, Indra, Soma, and Paramesh _th_ in Pra _g_ apatya.\n\n11:1:6:1515\\. They were born with a life of a thousand years: even as one\nwould see in the distance the opposite shore, so did they behold the opposite\nshore of their own life.\n\n11:1:6:1616\\. They went on singing praises and toiling. Then Paramesh _th_ in,\nson of Pra _g_ apati, saw that sacrifice, the New and Full-moon offerings, and\nperformed these offerings. Having performed them, he desired, 'Would I were\neverything here!' He became the waters, for the waters are everything here,\ninasmuch as they abide in the furthest place; for he who digs here on earth\nfinds indeed water; and, in truth, it is from that furthest place, to wit,\nfrom yonder sky that he 1 rains, whence the name Paramesh _th_ in (abiding in\nthe furthest, highest place).\n\n11:1:6:1717\\. Paramesh _th_ in spake unto his father Pra _g_ apati, 'I have\ndiscovered a sacrifice which fulfils wishes: let me perform this for\nthee!'--'So be it!' he said. He accordingly performed it 2 for him. Having\nsacrificed, he (Pra _g_ apati) desired, 'Would I were everything here!' He\nbecame the breath (vital air), for breath is everything here: Pra _g_ apati is\nthat breath which blows here (the wind); and whatsoever knows that it is thus\nhe blows is his (Pra _g_ apati's) eyesight; and whatsoever is endowed\n\np. 16\n\nwith breath is Pra _g_ apati. And, verily, whosoever thus knows that eyesight\nof Pra _g_ apati becomes, as it were, manifest,\n\n11:1:6:1818\\. Pra _g_ apati spake unto his son Indra, 'Let me perform for thee\nthis wish-fulfilling sacrifice which Paramesh _th_ in has just performed for\nme.'--'So be it!' he said. He accordingly performed it for him. Having\nsacrificed, he (Indra) desired, 'Would that I were everything here!' He became\nspeech (va _k_ ), for speech is everything here; whence they say, 'Indra is Va\n_k_.'\n\n11:1:6:1919\\. Indra spake unto his brothers Agni and Soma, 'Let me perform for\nyou this wish-fulfilling sacrifice which our father Pra _g_ apati has just\nperformed for me.'--'So be it!' they said. He accordingly performed it for\nthem. Having sacrificed, those two desired, 'Would that we were everything\nhere!' One of them became the eater of food, and the other became food: Agni\nbecame the eater of food, and Soma food; and the eater of food, and food,\nindeed, are everything here.\n\n11:1:6:2020\\. These five deities, then, performed that wish-fulfilling\nsacrifice; and for whatever wish they sacrificed, that wish of theirs was\nfulfilled; and, verily, for whatever wish one performs that sacrifice, that\nwish of his is fulfilled.\n\n11:1:6:2121\\. When they had sacrificed they beheld (discovered) the eastern\nquarter, and made it the eastern (front) quarter; as it now is that eastern\n(front) quarter: therefore creatures here move in a forward direction, for\nthey (the gods) made that the front quarter. 'Let us improve it 1 from here!'\n\np. 17\n\nthey said, and made it to be strength, 'May we see 1 this strength!' they\nsaid; and it became yonder sky 2.\n\n11:1:6:2222\\. They then beheld the southern quarter, and made it the southern\nquarter; and it now is that southern (right, dakshi _n_ a) quarter: whence the\ndakshi _n_ a (cows) stand to the south (of the altar) 3, and are driven up\nfrom the south, for they made that the southern one (dakshi _n_ a). 'Let us\nimprove it from here!' they said, and made it to be space. 'May we see this\nspace!' they said; and it became this air, for that (air) is space; for even\nas the resting-place here in this world is clearly the earth, so the resting-\nplace there in yonder world is clearly this air; and because, whilst being\nhere on earth, one does not see that space, therefore people say, 'That space\n(or, yonder world) is invisible.'\n\n11:1:6:2323\\. They then beheld the western quarter, and made it (to represent)\nhope,--wherefore it is only when 4, after going forwards (to the east), one\n\np. 18\n\nobtains (his object) that he goes (back) to that (western) quarter; for they\n(the gods) made that (quarter to represent) hope. 'Let us improve it from\nhere!' they said, and made it to be prosperity (or distinction). 'May we see\nthis prosperity!' they said; and it became this earth, for this (earth) is\nindeed (the source of) prosperity; whence he who obtains most therefrom\nbecomes the most prosperous.\n\n11:1:6:2424\\. They then beheld the northern quarter, and made it the waters.\n'Let us improve it from here!' they said, and made it (to represent) the law,\nfor the waters are the law: hence whenever the waters come (down) to this\n(terrestrial) world everything here comes to be in accordance with the law;\nbut whenever there is drought, then the stronger seizes upon the weaker, for\nthe waters are the law.\n\n11:1:6:2525\\. These then are eleven deities 1,--there are five fore-offerings,\ntwo butter-portions, the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t, and three after-offerings:--\n\n11:1:6:2626\\. These are eleven offerings,--it was, indeed, by these offerings\nthat the gods gained these worlds, and these quarters; and in like manner does\nthis (Sacrificer), by these offerings, gain these worlds, and these quarters.\n\n11:1:6:2727\\. And the four Patnisa _m_ ya _g_ as are the four intermediate\nquarters; and, indeed, it was by the four Patnisa _m_ ya _g_ as that the gods\ngained the intermediate quarters; and by means of them this (Sacrificer) now\ngains the intermediate quarters.\n\np. 19\n\n11:1:6:2828\\. And as to the I _d_ a,--thereby the gods gained food; and in\nlike manner does this (Sacrificer) thereby gain food. This, then, is the\ncompleteness of the New and Full-moon sacrifices as regards the gods.\n\n11:1:6:2929\\. Now as to the body:--there are in man these five breathings, not\nincluding the eyes; they are the five fore-offerings, and the two butter-\nportions are the eyes.\n\n11:1:6:3030\\. The Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t is the same as this downward breathing;\nand because he offers that (oblation), as it were, apart from the other\noblations 1, therefore all the breathings recoil from that breathing; and\nbecause for the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t he cuts portions from all the sacrificial\ndishes, therefore everything that enters these (channels of the other)\nbreathings meets in (the channel of) that breathing.\n\n11:1:6:3131\\. The three after-offerings are the three male organs 2; and that\nwhich is the chief after-offering is, as it were, the chief organ. 'He should\noffer it without drawing breath 3,' they say, 'for thus it becomes unfailing\nfor him.'\n\n11:1:6:3232\\. He may, however, draw breath once, for that (organ) has one\njoint; but if it were jointless, it\n\np. 20\n\neither would only stand erect, or it would hang down; whilst now it both\nbecomes erect and hangs down: he may therefore draw breath once.\n\n11:1:6:3333\\. The four Patnisa _m_ ya _g_ as are the two arms (or front legs)\nand the two thighs--the support, in fact 1; and the I _d_ a is this vital air\n(in the centre); and inasmuch as that (I _d_ a) is not offered in the fire,\nbut remains as unburnt, therefore this (central) vital air is undivided.\n\n11:1:6:3434\\. The invitatory and offering-formulas are the bone, and the\noffering-material is the flesh. The invitatory and offering-formulas are (in)\nmeasured metre, whence the bones of a fat and a lean person are alike: but\ninasmuch as he takes now more, now less, offering-material, therefore the\nflesh of a fat person is fat, and the flesh of a lean person is lean. This\nsacrifice he performs to any deity he pleases and for whom there is a\nsacrificial dish.\n\n11:1:6:3535\\. Now, these are offerings from which nothing must be omitted; but\nwere one to omit anything of them, it would be as if he were to break off some\nlimb, or knock out some (channel of the) vital air. Other oblations, indeed,\nare either added to or omitted.\n\n36\\. These, then, are sixteen offerings, for man consists of sixteen parts,\nand the sacrifice is the Man (Purusha): hence there are sixteen offerings.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[12:1](sbe44008.htm#fr_100) Or, they toiled and became heated (with fervid\ndevotion).

The St.\nPetersb. Dict. p. 17 takes 'upa-kurute' here in the sense of 'to cherish\n(hegen, pflegen);' Professor Delbruck, Altind. Syntax, p. 238, doubtfully in\nthat of 'worship, revere (verehren);'--enam pra _k_ i _m_ di _s_ am upetya ita\n_h_ para _m_ kurvimahi karyantara _m_ s _ri_ _g_ emahi, Say.\n\n[17:1](sbe44008.htm#fr_105) The particle 'khalu' might perhaps be rendered by\n'really,' or--'could we but see it,' 'were it but (really) visible to us.'\n\n[17:2](sbe44008.htm#fr_106) That is, it was moved up to them.\n\n[17:3](sbe44008.htm#fr_107) See IV, 3, 4, 14.\n\n[17:4](sbe44008.htm#fr_108) It seems hardly possible to take 'yad--tena' here\nin the usual causal sense,--it is only because (or, inasmuch as) one obtains\n(one's object) after going forwards that one goes to the western quarter. What\nis implied, in any case, is that first some hope, or desire, is conceived the\naccomplishment of which is only brought about by a forward movement, or by\naction; and that success in attaining the object sought for is followed by the\nconception of fresh desires. For the same force of 'yad--tena' (when--then)\nsee [XI, 3, 3, 4](sbe44020.htm#11:3:3:4)-[6](sbe44020.htm#11:3:3:6).\n\n[18:1](sbe44008.htm#fr_109) Viz. the four quarters and the objects enumerated\nas represented by them.\n\n[19:1](sbe44008.htm#fr_110) See I, 7, 3, 21, where I would now translate, He\noffers apart (sideways), as it were, from the other oblations,--the oblation\nto Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t being poured out on the north side of the fire, so\nas not to come in contact with the chief oblations and the butter-portions.\n\n[19:2](sbe44008.htm#fr_111) That is, including the testicles.\n\n[19:3](sbe44008.htm#fr_112) Or, rather,--at the third after-offering (viz.\nthat to Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t),--the Hot _ri_ should (according to some\nauthorities) pronounce the offering-formula, which is considerably longer than\nthose of the two other offerings, without making a pause; whilst others allow\nhim to pause once.\n\n[20:1](sbe44008.htm#fr_113) Bahudvayam urudvaya _m_ _k_ atvara _h_ patnisa _m_\nya _g_ a _h_ , atas te pratish _th_ atmaka _h_ ; ayam eva madhyama _h_ pra _n_\na i _d_ a, Say.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 1, 7.
