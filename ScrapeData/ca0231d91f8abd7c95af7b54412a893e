Vyasa said :-- When the Devas retired from the battlefield, S\xc2\x92ukracharya\naddressed the Demons thus :-- O best of the Demons! Please hear, what had been\ntold to me by Brahma in days of yore.\n\n\n\n2-3. Janardan Vi _sn_ u is coming here to slay all the Demons, He killed\nbefore Hira _n_ yak _s_ a, the king of the Asuras, in His Boar incarnation. He\nkilled Hira _n_ yakasipu by assuming His Man-Lion appearance; now too, he will\nkill all the Daityas, no doubt, with great enthusiasm.\n\n\n\n4-5. Now my mantra force will not be of any avail before S\xc2\x92ri Hari. And\nwithout my help you will not be able to conquer the Devas. Therefore, O\nDemons, wait for some time for me; I will start today to the presence of S'iva\nMahadeva to obtain from him the Mantra S\xc2\x92akti.\n\n\n\np. 287\n\n\n\n6\\. I will return, as early as possible, getting the Mantra from S\xc2\x92ri\nMahadeva; and with the help of the power of those great Mantras I will be able\nto protect you thoroughly.\n\n\n\n7\\. The Daityas said :-- O best of the Munis! We are now defeated and our\nforces are well nigh exhausted; how will we be able to stay on this earth and\nexpect your return for so long a time?\n\n\n\n8\\. Those who were of great strength amongst us, they all are slain; now we\nare left very few in number. In this crisis it is not advisable and auspicious\nfor us to remain here in this battlefield.\n\n\n\n9\\. S\xc2\x92ukracharya said :-- Better you all stay here until I return, getting the\nrequisite Mantra; remain peaceful and engaged in asceticism.\n\n\n\n10\\. The heroes apply one or other of the following four measures :--\nconciliation, alliance, gifts and bribery, partitions and sowing dissensions\nand punishment or open attack according to the conditions of time, place\nstrength and circumstances.\n\n\n\n11\\. Intelligent and well wishing persons do serve their enemies even in time\nof distress; but no sooner they find that their strength and army have\nincreased, than they try at once to kill all their enemies.\n\n\n\n12\\. Now, therefore, pretend your meekness and allegiance and adopt peace and\nremain in your own place until my arrival.\n\n\n\n13\\. O Demons! I will come back with the Mantra from Mahadeva. I will fight\nagain with the Devas, by that veritable mantra power.\n\n\n\n14\\. O king! Thus firmly making up his mind to have the Mantra, S\xc2\x92ukracharya\nwent to Mahadeva.\n\n\n\n15\\. The Danavas sent Prahlada to the Devas for conciliation. The Devas\nregarded Prahlada truthful and they all trusted on him.\n\n\n\n16\\. Prahlada with Asuras addressed thus the Devas with gentleness and\nhumility.\n\n\n\n17\\. O Immortals! We all have abandoned our weapons and armour. Now we desire\nto wear barks of trees and practise asceticism.\n\n\n\n18\\. The Devas took Prahlada's words to be true and deserted from further\nfight; were freed of anxiety and felt all delighted.\n\n\n\n19\\. On the Daitya\xc2\x92s leaving their weapons, the Gods desisted from battle,\nwent to their respective places and freely gave themselves up to pleasure and\namusements.\n\n\n\n20\\. The Daityas controlled themselves and practised asceticism in the\nKas\xc2\x92yapa\xc2\x92s hermitage, expecting the return of S\xc2\x92ukracharya.\n\n\n\n21\\. S\xc2\x92ukracharya went to Kailasa and made respectful obeisance to the God\nMahadeva. Mahadeva enquired of the cause of his coming.\n\n\n\np. 288\n\n\n\n22\\. S\xc2\x92ukracharya said :-- I ask for Mantras, O Deva! from you that are not\npossessed by Brihaspati, for the defeat of the Devas, and the victory of the\nAsuras.\n\n\n\n23\\. Vyasa said :-- On hearing his words, the all-knowing S\xc2\x92ankara S\xc2\x92iva began\nto think what He would do in this matter.\n\n\n\n24\\. Certainly, this is with the revengeful object of attacking the Devas, for\ntheir defeat and for the victory of the Asuras that this Muni has come.\n\n\n\n25\\. The Devas ought to be protected by me; thus thinking, S\xc2\x92ankara Mahes\xc2\x92vara\nadvised him an entirely difficult tapasya to practise.\n\n\n\n26\\. Full one thousand years he would practise tapasya with feet upwards and\nhead downwards, he will have to inhale the smoke of burnt husk. Then he will\nget the Mantra and his desires will be fulfilled.\n\n\n\n27\\. That would be done; thus saying to S\xc2\x92ankara, S\xc2\x92ukracharya practised that\nexcellent vow, peaceful and inhaling the smoke of husk to get that Mantra.\n\n\n\n28-29. The Devas came to know that S\xc2\x92ukracharya is practising his vow and the\nDaityas have become arrogant. They then counselled.\n\n\n\n30\\. And came to the conclusion, took up weapons and arms and went to the\nDaityas, ready to fight.\n\n\n\n31\\. The Daityas, seeing the Devas dressed in armour and holding weapons and\ncoming from all sides, became very much afraid and anxious.\n\n\n\n32\\. The Daityas, seeing this all on a sudden, were attacked with fear and\nbegan to address the Devas, proud with their army, in words, full of good\nmeanings and morals.\n\n\n\n33\\. O Devas! We have abandoned our arms; we are now armless; our spiritual\nguide is in his tapasya, you gave us words of fearlessness; why then you have\ncome now dressed in full armour and with armies to kill us.\n\n\n\n34\\. O Devas! Where is your truth. And where is your religion acccording to\nS\xc2\x92ruti? It is stated in S\xc2\x92ruti never to kill the weaponless, the fear\nstricken, and the refugees.\n\n\n\n35\\. The Devas said :-- You sent your good S\xc2\x92ukracharya, out of pretence to\nacquire the Mantras; your asceticism is veiled under a deceitful object.\nTherefore we will fight with you certainly.\n\n\n\n36\\. Be ready now and dress yourself with your arms and ammunitions, \xc2\x93Lo!\nWhenever you get any loop hole in your enemies, catch hold of it and kill your\nenemy.\xc2\x94 This is the eternal religion.\n\n\n\np. 289\n\n\n\n37\\. Vyasa said :-- On thus hearing the reply from the Devas, the Daityas\nafter consideration quitted that place and fled away with terror.\n\n\n\n38\\. And they took refuge under the S\xc2\x92ukracharya\xc2\x92s mother. She saw the Daityas\nvery much fearstricken and at once guaranteed to them protection from fear.\n\n\n\n39\\. The mother of Kavya S\xc2\x92ukracharya said :-- Don\xc2\x92t fear; don\xc2\x92t fear; cast\naway fear. O Danavas! In my presence, no fear can overtake you.\n\n40\\. The Asuras on hearing her words were free from anxiety and pain and\nremained in that hermitage, in no way now bewildered or agitated, though they\nhad no arms.\n\n\n\n41-42. Here the Devas, seeing the Daityas flying away, pursued them and\nentering the hermitage were ready to kill the Daityas, not taking into account\nwhat strength they gained there. The mother of S\xc2\x92ukra warned the Devas not to\nkill; but, inspite of her hindrance, they began to slay the Daityas.\n\n\n\n43\\. Seeing the Daityas thus attacked, the mother was furiously irritated and\ntold them she would make all of them overpowered by sleep by her tapas\nstrength, clarified intellectual force.\n\n\n\nNote :--Is it by the asphyxiating gas? Or, by poisonous vapours or liquids?\n\n\n\n44\\. So saying she sent the Goddess of sleep who at once overpowered the Gods\nand made them all lie down on the grounds senseless. Indra with the other\nDevas lay there dumb, and miserable.\n\n\n\n45\\. On seeing Indra thus stupefied by sleep, the Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u told\nIndra to enter into His body. He would then carry him to another place and he\nwill be better.\n\n\n\n46-47. Indra entered into the Vi _sn_ u\xc2\x92s body; and, under His protection, he\nbecame free from sleep and fear. On seeing Indra thus sheltered by Vi _sn_ u\nand fearless, the mother of Kavya spoke.\n\n\n\n48\\. O Indra! I will devour you with Vi _sn_ u today by my Tapas force. All\nthe Devas will presently see all this and my extraordinary power.\n\n\n\nN.B.: Is it by making the earth go down, causing a fissure, thus engulfing the\nwhole army? Or by blowing them up? Or by showering jets of poisonous gas or\nhot water or vapour from all sides.\n\n\n\n49\\. Vyasa said :-- O king! No sooner the mother spoke thus, than both Indra\nand Vi _sn_ u were both stupefied under her magical spell, superior thought\npower, and a thorough learning of the art of warfare.\n\n\n\n50\\. The Devas, seeing them very much overpowered and bewildered, were greatly\nstruck with wonder; they became desperate and began to cry aloud.\n\n\n\np. 290\n\n\n\n51\\. Indra, on hearing the Devas cry aloud, told Vi _sn_ u, O Madhusudana! I\nam more bewildered in particular than yourself.\n\n\n\n52\\. O Madhava! No need of any further consideration. Before this wretch,\ninflated with pride by her tapasya, burns us, better cause her death as early\nas possible.\n\n\n\n53\\. When thus requested by Indra who was very much perplexed, Bhagavan Vi\n_sn_ u quickly remembered his Sudars\xc2\x92ana disc, casting aside the thought that\nit is hateful to kill a woman.\n\n\n\n54-55. The disc, the ever obedient weapon of Vi _sn_ u appeared instantly at\nhis remembrance; and Vi _sn_ u, becoming angry as prompted by Indra held the\ndisc in His hand, and, hurling it off on the S\xc2\x92ukra\xc2\x92s mother, severed off her\nhead quickly. The god Indra became very glad at this.\n\n\n\n56\\. The Devas became free from sorrow, got very much pleased and heartily\nexclaimed victory to Hari and worshipped Him and began to chant His praises.\n\n\n\n57\\. Indra and Vi _sn_ u then became free from all troubles; but they began to\nfear that Bhrigu (S\xc2\x92ukra\xc2\x92s father) would curse them terribly and without fail.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Eleventh Chapter in the Fourth Book of S\xc2\x92ri mad Devi Bhagavatam,\nthe Maha Pura _n_ am of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa, on S\xc2\x92ukra\xc2\x92s\ngoing to Mahadeva to get the Mantra.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 12](bk04ch12.htm)\n\n"
