Vyasa said :-- O King! In the meanwhile the King Turvasu performed the\nJatakarma (a religious ceremony performed at the birth of a child) and other\nceremonies of the child. The boy was nurtured duly and began to grow older day\nby day. The King began to enjoy his worldly life on getting this son and\nthought within himself that the boy had freed him from the three debts due to\nthe Fathers, the Ri _s_ is and the Devas. Next, in the sixth month, the King\nperformed the Annaprasana ceremony (putting the boiled rice in the mouth of\nthe child) and in the third year performed regularly his Chu _d_ a Kara _n_ a\n(the ceremony of the first tonsure) ceremony. He distributed on those\noccasions various articles, wealth and cows to the Brahma _n_ as and other\narticles to various other mendicants and made them glad. In the eleventh year,\nhe performed the boy\xc2\x92s holy\n\n\n\np. 557\n\n\n\nthread (Upanayana) ceremony and tying the girdle made of a triple string of\nMunja grass and put the boy to learn archery. Next when the boy passed off\nproficiently in the study of the Vedas and in learning the kingly duties, the\nKing desired to install him on the throne. The King Turvasu then collected\nwith great care all the necessary articles for installation in an auspicious\nday, the combination of Pu _s_ ya asterism and Arka Yoga. He called then the\nBrahmi _n_ s, well versed in the Vedas and in the S\xc2\x92astras, and became ready,\nin accordance with due rites, to perform the installation ceremony of the\nprince. Waters were brought from various sacred places of pilgrimage and from\nthe several oceans and on an auspicious day the King performed himself the\ninstallation of his son. When the ceremony was over the King gave away hoards\nof wealth to the Brahmi _n_ s and giving the charge of his kingdom to his son,\nhe went to the forest with a desire to ascend to the Heavens.\n\n\n\n11-22. Thus placing Ekavira on the throne, the King Turvasu shewed respects to\nhis ministers, and, controlling his senses went to the forest accompanied by\nhis wife. On the top of the Mainaka mountain he took up the vow of Vanaprastha\nand sustaining his life on leaves and fruits began to meditate Parvati. Thus\nwhen his Prarabdha Karma ended, he left his mortal coil with his wife and went\nby virtue of his good deeds to the Indraloka. Hearing that the King had\nascended to Heavens, his son Ekavira Haihaya performed his funeral ceremonies\naccording to the rules laid down by the Vedas. The King\xc2\x92s son, the intelligent\nHaihaya, performed, one after another, all the ceremonies due and began to\ngovern the kingdom which was free from enemies. The virtuous King Ekavira\nremained duly obedient to his ministers after he got possession of his kingdom\nand began to enjoy all the best things. The powerful King one day went on\nhorseback to the banks of the Ganges with the minister\xc2\x92s son. Roaming about,\nhe found there the boughs of trees had assumed a very graceful appearance,\nwith loads of fruits, echoed with the sweet voice of the cuckoos and with the\nhumming of the bees. Close by were the hermitages of the Munis, where the\nbucks were skipping about and at other places the Vedas were being chanted.\nThe smoke was seen rising from the altars, where oblations were being offered\nand appeared to form like a black canopy in the Heavens. Full ripe grains were\nenhancing the beauty of the fields and the cowherdesses were merrily watching\nthe fields. Places of recreations adorned with full blown lotuses and\nbeautiful groves were attracting the attention of the visitors. The various\ntrees, Piyala, Champaka, Panasa, Bakula, Tilaka, Kadamba and Mandara, and\nothers were adorned with fruits, stealing away the minds of the people. At\nother places, other trees Sal, Tamala, Jack,\n\n\n\np. 558\n\n\n\nMango, Kali Kadamba, etc., stood gracefully. Next when the King went to the\nGanges water, he saw the gay beautiful full blown lotuses were spreading their\nfragrant scents all around.\n\n\n\n23-31. On the right side of these lotuses, he saw a lotus-eyed girl. She was\nshining like the gold, her beautiful hairs were long and curling; her throat\nwas like a Kambu, belly thin, lips like the Bimba fruits, several other limbs\nwell built and graceful, breasts risen a little, nose beautiful and all her\nbody was exquisitely lovely; that lady just blooming into youth was suffering\nbereavements from her comrades and was very distressed and seemed bewildered.\nShe was crying like an ewe in a dense lonely forest. Seeing her, the King\nasked her what was the reason of her sorrows? O Cuckoo-voiced One! You are as\nyet a girl; who has left you alone in this state? O Sweet One! Tell me where\nis your husband now or where is your father? O One looking askance! What is\nyour trouble; explain it to me. O thin-bellied One! I will, no doubt, remove\nall your sorrows and troubles. O fair-limbed One! In my dominion nobody ever\ngives trouble to any other body. O lovely One! There is no fear in my kingdom\nfrom thieves or Rak _s_ asas; or any fear from any serious dangerous\ncalamities on this earth, fear from lions, tigers or any other dangers while\nmy sway is predominant.\n\n\n\n32-41. O One of beautiful thighs! Why are you crying on this lonely bank of\nthe Ganges? Tell me what is your pain? O Pure One! I can remove the pains and\nmiseries, even of a serious nature, of men, whether they come from the Deva or\nhuman sources; and this is my principal vow. O Large-eyed One! Speak what is\nyour inmost desire; I will carry it out instantaneously. When the king thus\nspoke, that beautiful woman spoke in gentle words :-- O King! Hear the cause\nof my sorrows. O King! Why will the people cry, to no purpose, unless\ncalamities come before them? O Mighty-armed One! I now tell you why I am\nweeping. O King! There was a very religious King named Rabhya in another\nprovince that is not yours. At first he had no issue. He had a very beautiful\nwife named Rukmarekha. She was clever, chaste and endowed with all auspicious\nqualities. But issueless as she was, she remained very sorry and, in a\nremorseful tone, she spoke to her husband Raibbya :-- O Lord! I am barren; I\nhave no sons; I am therefore a very unhappy creature. My life is in vain; what\nuse is there in my living? When the queen thus spoke very distressedly, the\nking called the Brahma _n_ as, versed in the Vedas, and began to perform an\nexcellent sacrificial ceremony, in due accordance with the Vedic rules. With a\ndesire to get a son, he made many presents in profuse quantities. When copious\nquantities\n\n\n\np. 559\n\n\n\nof ghee were offered as oblations, there arose, from the fire, a girl\nbeautiful in all respects and endowed with all auspicious signs.\n\n\n\n42-53. Her teeth were very nice, eyebrows very lovely, face enchanting like a\nFull Moon, the lustre of the body lovely and of a golden colour; her hairs\nwere fine and curling; her lips like the Bimba flowers; her hands and face\nwere of a red colour; her eyes were red like lotus and her limbs were soft and\ngentle. When the girl arose from the fire, the priest (Hota) took that lean\nand thin lady of a nice waist by her arms and presented her to the King and\nsaid :-- O King! Accept this daughter, endowed with all auspicious signs. When\nHoma was being performed, the daughter came up like the garland Ekavali;\ntherefore this girl became famous in this world by the name Ekavali. O Ruler\nof the earth! Take this girl, resembling a son and be happy.\n\n\n\nO King! Vi _sn_ u, the Deva of the Devas, has given you this Jewel, this\ndaughter; so be contented. Hearing thus the words of the priest, the King saw\nthis good-looking girl and with gladdened heart took the beautiful daughter\nfrom his hands. Thus with that lovely daughter he went to his wife Rukmarekha\nand said :-- O Beautiful One! Take this daughter. The queen Rukmarekha felt\nthe pleasure of having a son when she got in her arms that lotus eyed\nbeautiful daughter. The King next performed the natal and other ceremonies of\nthe daughter and did all other acts as if she had been a son to him duly in\naccordance with the rules. The King performed his own sacrificial ceremonies\nand gave away lots of Dak _s_ i _n_ as to the Brahmi _n_ s and dismissed them\nand became very glad. That beautiful girl was nursed and cared after like a\nson and she grew older day by day. The Queen Rukmarekha was very gladdened to\nget her. On that very day the birthday festival was performed as on the\noccasion of the birth of a son. And that daughter grew older, very\naffectionate and dear to all.\n\n\n\n54-61. O Lovely One! You are a king and intelligent too; I will describe to\nyou all the details; Hear. I am the daughter of the minister to that King. My\nname is Yas\xc2\x92ovati. That daughter and I look alike and of the same age.\nTherefore the king has made me her comrade. I spend my time day and night\nalways with her as her constant dear companion. Ekavali likes very much to\nremain and sport wherever she finds sweet-scented lotuses; at other places she\ndoes not find happiness. At the distant banks of the Ganges many lotuses grow;\ntherefore Ekavali goes there with great pleasure to that place with me and her\nother fellow mates. One day I told the King that Ekavali used to\n\n\n\np. 560\n\n\n\ngo daily to a distant solitary forest to see the lotus-lake. Then the King\naddressed her not to go and he got a lake built within the compounds of his\npalace and planted many lotus seeds therein. Gradually the lotuses began to\nblossom and the bees came there to drink honey. Still she used to go outside\nin search of lotuses. Then the King sent armed guards to accompany her. Thus\nthat thin-bodied daughter of the King used to go daily to the banks of the\nGanges for play, guarded by armed soldiers, accompanied by myself and other\ncompanions. Again when the sporting was over, she used to return to the\npalace.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-First Chapter on the Sixth Book on the installation of\nEkavira and the birth of Ekavali in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 22](bk06ch22.htm)\n\n'
