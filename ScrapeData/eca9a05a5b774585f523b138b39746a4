XXII.\n\nJarasandha besieges Mathura; is defeated, but repeatedly renews the attack.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--The mighty Kansa had married the two daughters of Jarasandha, one\nnamed Asti, the other Prapti. Jarasandha was king of Magadha, and a very\npowerful prince 1; who, when he heard that Krishn\xcc\x81a had killed his son-in-law,\nwas much incensed, and, collecting a large force, marched against Mathura,\ndetermined to put the Yadavas and Krishn\xcc\x81a to the sword. Accordingly he\ninvested the city with three and twenty numerous divisions of his forces 2.\nRama and Janarddana sallied from the town with a slender, but resolute force,\nand fought bravely with the armies of Magadha. The two youthful leaders\nprudently resolved to have recourse to their ancient weapons, and accordingly\nthe bow of Hari, with two quivers filled with exhaustless arrows, and the mace\ncalled Kaumodaki, and the ploughshare of Balabhadra, as well as the club\nSaunanda, descended at a wish from heaven. Armed with these weapons, they\nspeedily discomfited the king of Magadha and his hosts, and reentered the city\nin triumph.\n\nAlthough the wicked king of Magadha, Jarasandha, was defeated, yet Krishn\xcc\x81a\nknew that whilst he escaped alive he was not subdued; and in fact he soon\nreturned with a mighty force, and was again forced by Rama and Krishn\xcc\x81a to\nfly. Eighteen times 3 did the haughty prince of Magadha renew his attack upon\nthe Yadavas, headed by Krishn\xcc\x81a; and was as often defeated and put to the rout\nby them, with very inferior numbers. That the Yadavas were not overpowered by\ntheir foes, was owing to the present might of the portion of the discus-armed\nVishn\xcc\x81u.\n\np. 564\n\n[paragraph continues] It was the pastime of the lord of the universe, in his\ncapacity of man, to launch various weapons against his enemies; for what\neffort of power to annihilate his foes could be necessary to him, whose fiat\ncreates and destroys the world? but as subjecting himself to human customs, he\nformed alliances with the brave, and engaged in hostilities with the base. He\nhad recourse to the four devices of policy, or negotiation, presents, sowing\ndissension, and chastisement; and sometimes even betook himself to flight.\nThus imitating the conduct of human beings, the lord of the world pursued at\nwill his sports.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[563:1](vp139.htm#fr_1522) See page [456](vp112.htm#page_456).\n\n[563:2](vp139.htm#fr_1523) With twenty-three Akshouhinis, each consisting of\n109,300 infantry, 65,610 horse, 22,870 chariots, and as many elephants.
