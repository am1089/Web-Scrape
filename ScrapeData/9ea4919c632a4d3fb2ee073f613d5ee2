Janamejaya spoke :-- O best of Munis! How did Vi _sn_ u, of wonderful\ndeeds, get his incarnation owing to the curse, cast on Him by Bhrigu? what\nwere His different incarnations in different Manvantaras respectively? O Thou,\nwell versed in religion! O Brahma _n_ a! Kindly narrate those sin-destroying\ndeeds of Hari in His several incarnations, that are the source of happiness,\npeace and welfare to all humanity.\n\n\n\n3\\. Vyasa said :-- O king! Hear, I am narrating to you the incarnations of\nS\xc2\x92ri Bhagavan Hari which He had in the several Manvantaras and in the several\nYugas respectively.\n\n\n\n4\\. I will tell you now, in brief, what forms He took and what deeds He did in\nthe various incarnations.\n\n\n\n5\\. In the Chak _s_ usa Manvantara, the Bhagavan Hari took the incarnation of\nDharma; and the two sons of Dharma, Nara Naraya _n_ a, were widely celebrated\nin this world.\n\n\n\n6\\. Then, in the present Vaivasvata Manvantara, under the reign of Vaivasvata\nManu in the second Yuga, Bhagavan Hari incarnated as Dattatreya, in the shape\nof the son of Atri Ri _s_ i.\n\n\n\n7\\. Anasuya the wife of Atri, was desirous to have, as her sons, the three\nDevas Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and Rudra; and in fulfilment of her desires, the Devas\ntook their births in her womb.\n\n\n\n8\\. Anasuya, was foremost amongst the chaste and virtuous women and on her\npraying, Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and Rudra the Trinity at once agreed to become her\nsons.\n\n\n\n9\\. Brahma was born as Soma, Hari was born as Dattatreya and Rudra was born as\nDurvasa.\n\n\n\n10\\. In the fourth Yuga, the Bhagavan assumed the beautiful double form in\none, the upper part resembling a lion and the lower part a human being to\naccomplish the noble purpose of the Devas.\n\n\n\n11\\. It was to kill Hira _n_ yakas\xc2\x92ipu that the Bhagavan Hari assumed this\nappearance, wonderful even to the Devas.\n\n\n\n12\\. In the Treta Yuga, the superior and the best of all the Yugas, the\nBhagavan incarnated as Vamana ( the Dwarf), the son of Mahar _s_ i Kas\xc2\x92yapa,\nto curb the power of Bali.\n\n\n\n13\\. The Dwarf Hari took away by pretext, the kingdom of Bali, while he was\nperforming a sacrifice and sent him down into the Patala (the lower regions).\n\n\n\np. 310\n\n\n\n14\\. Afterwards, in the nineteenth Yuga, known as the Treta Yuga, S\xc2\x92ri\nBhagavan Hari incarnated as Paras\xc2\x92urama, very powerful and the son of\nJamadagni Ri _s_ i.\n\n\n\n15\\. He was very beautiful and graceful in his body, truthful and the\nconqueror of his senses. He extirpated the K _s_ attriya race and gave the\nwhole world over to the high minded Ri _s_ i Kas\xc2\x92yapa.\n\n\n\n16\\. O king! He is the Paras\xc2\x92urama, the sin-destroyer, the incarnation of\nHari, and the doer of wonderful deeds.\n\n\n\n17-20. After that the Bhagavan Hari incarnated as Rama, the son of Das\xc2\x92aratha.\nNext in the twenty-eighth Dvapara Yuga, He incarnated as the very powerful\nArju _n_ a and S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, the Ams\xc2\x92as of Nara Naraya _n_ a. To remove the\nload of the earth, these two were born; and they fought deadly battles in the\nbattlefield of Kuruk _s_ ettra. O king! Thus the several incarnations of Hari\narose, according to the requirements of Prakriti. O King! These three worlds\nare under the control of Prakriti.\n\n\n\n21\\. Whatever the Prakriti wishes at any time, She can fashion the world in\nthat way. And She does this incessantly in accordance with the Word Divine,\nthe Highest S\xc2\x92akti, to please the Puru _s_ a, without any cessation.\n\n\n\n22-23. In days of yore, the most ancient Bhagavan, the Highest, above all the\nqualities of Maya, formless, all pervading, difficult to be conceived, without\nany decay, self-supporting, without any want, created these worlds, moving and\nunmoving and He manifested Himself as the Trinity, Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, Mahes\xc2\x92a\nin the shape of the three qualities Sattva, Rajas and Tamas, and which is\ncalled the Highest Prakriti.\n\n\n\n24\\. This all auspicious Prakriti shines differently according to the\ndifferences in time and circumstances. This threefold Prakriti, the Great\nEnchantress of the world is creating, preserving the worlds and is destroying\nthem at the end of the Kalpas.\n\n\n\n25\\. O King! Whenever there takes place the union with this Prakriti, Brahma\ncreates, Vi _sn_ u preserves, and the all-auspicious God S\xc2\x92ankara destroys the\nworlds.\n\n\n\n26\\. It was She That gave birth to Kakutstha, the best of the kings; and to\nconquer the Danavas, She placed him at a certain place.\n\n\n\n27\\. O king! Thus all men controlled by the Great Law in this world, enjoy\nsometimes the pleasures, enjoy sometimes pains and thus exist in the world.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Sixteenth Chapter in the Fourth Book of S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam, the Mahapura _n_ am of 18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa,\non the Birth of the several Avataras of Vi _sn_ u and their deeds.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 17](bk04ch17.htm)\n\n'
