Pra _n_ a is Brahman, on account of connexion.\n\nWe read in the Pratardana-vidya in the Kaushitaki-brahma _n_ a that\n'Pratardana, the son of Divodasa, came, by fighting and strength, to the\nbeloved abode of Indra.' Being asked by Indra to choose a boon he requests the\nGod to bestow on him that boon which he himself considers most beneficial to\nman; whereupon Indra says, 'I am pra _n_ a (breath), the intelligent Self,\nmeditate on me as Life, as Immortality.' Here the doubt arises whether the\nbeing called Pra _n_ a and Indra, and designating itself as the object of a\nmeditation most beneficial to man, is an individual soul, or the highest Self.\n--An individual soul, the Purvapakshin maintains. For, he says, the word\n'Indra' is known to denote an individual God, and the word 'Pra _n_ a,' which\nstands in grammatical co-ordination with Indra, also applies to individual\nsouls. This individual being, called Indra, instructs Pratardana that\nmeditation on himself is most beneficial to man. But what is most beneficial\nto man is only the means to attain immortality, and such a means is found in\nmeditation on the causal principle of the world, as we know from the text,\n'For him there is delay only so long as he is not delivered; then he will be\nperfect' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 14, 2). We hence conclude that Indra, who is known as\nan individual soul, is the causal principle, Brahman.\n\nThis view is rejected by the Sutra. The being called Indra and Pra _n_ a is\nnot a mere individual soul, but the highest Brahman, which is other than all\nindividual souls. For on this supposition only it is appropriate that the\nbeing introduced as Indra and Pra _n_ a should, in the way of grammatical co-\nordination, be connected with such terms as 'blessed,' 'non-ageing,'\n'immortal.' ('That Pra _n_ a indeed is the intelligent Self, blessed, non-\nageing, immortal,' Kau. Up. III, 9.)\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 30. If it be said that Brahman is not denoted...](sbe48063.htm)\n\n"
