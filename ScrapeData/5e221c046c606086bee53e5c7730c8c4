( _cont_.)\n\n26\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XXVI.\n\nIf the _g_ uhu has been elsewhere employed, let it be done with a ladle\n(sruva).\n\n26c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe _g_ uhu is a sru _k_ , a spoon, the sruva, a ladle.\n\n27\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XXVII.\n\nThe offering is made in the \xc3\x82havaniya fire.\n\n28\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XXVIII.\n\nThe sacrificial vessels are kept from the first laying of the fires (adhana)\nfor the whole life.\n\n28c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nAll sacrificial vessels and instruments are to be kept, and most of them are\nburnt with the sacrificer at his death.\n\n29\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XXIX.\n\nAt every sacrifice these vessels are to be purified.\n\n30\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XXX.\n\nThe rule for the sacrifice are the Mantras and Brahma _n_ as.\n\n31\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XXXI.\n\nThe name Veda belongs both to the Mantras and Brahma _n_ as.\n\np. 324\n\n32\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XXXII.\n\nThe Brahma _n_ as are the precepts for the sacrifice.\n\n33\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XXXIII.\n\nThe rest of the Brahma _n_ a, that which does not contain precepts, consists\nof explanations, i.e. reproof, praise, stories, and traditions.\n\n33c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nIt is difficult to find words corresponding to technical terms in Sanskrit.\nArthavada, which I have translated by explanation, means not only the telling\nof the meaning, but likewise the telling of the object; parak _ri_ ti, story,\nmeans literally the action of another; purakalpa, traditions, means the former\nstate. The difference between the two is stated to be that parak _ri_ ti\nrefers to the act of one person, purakalpa to that of several. This subject is\nfully treated in the Purva-mima _m_ sa. Satyavrata begins a new Sutra with\n'reproof' (ninda).\n\n34\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XXXIV.\n\nAll the rest are Mantras.\n\n35\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XXXV.\n\nBut passages which are not handed down, are not to be classed as Mantras, as,\nfor instance, the pravara, the words used in choosing priests, divine or\nhuman; uha, substitution of one word for another; and namadheya-graha _n_ a,\nthe mentioning of the names of particular sacrificers.\n\n35c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe reason why such passages are not to be treated as Mantras is that they\nshould not be subject to some of the preceding rules, as, for instance, the\nmurmuring, enjoined in Sutra IX. Those passages naturally vary in each\nsacrifice. With regard to the names a distinction is made\n\np. 325\n\nbetween the garhyam nama, the domestic name of a person, such as Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a\n_s_ arman, and the astrological name, such as Rauhi _n_ a, derived from the\nstar Rohi _n_ i.\n\n36\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XXXVI.\n\nLikewise the sound of a carriage and the sound of a drum.\n\n36c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThese sounds, though serving for the sacrifice, are not to be considered as\nliable to the rules given for the recitation of Mantras.\n\n37\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XXXVII.\n\nThe prohibition of reciting Mantras in the Svadhyaya does not apply to the\nsacrifice, because there is then a different object.\n\n37c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nSvadhyaya, i.e. self-reading, is the name given to the study of the Veda, both\nin first learning and in afterwards repeating it. This study is under several\nrestrictions, but these restrictions cease when the Veda is used for\nsacrificial purposes.\n\n38\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XXXVIII.\n\nSacrificial acts are accompanied by one Mantra.\n\n38c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nIf it is said that the priest cuts the plants with fourteen verses, that means\nthat there are fourteen plants to be cut and that one verse is used for each\nplant.\n\n39\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XXXIX.\n\nThis applies also to sacrificial acts which have a number and are to be\ncarried out by separate (repeated) acts.\n\np. 326\n\n39c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nIf a rule is given, such as tri _h_ prokshati, he sprinkles thrice, the mantra\nwhich accompanies the act, is recited once only. Again in the case of acts\nthat require repetitions, such as rubbing, pounding, &c., the hymns are\nrecited once only.\n\n40\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XL.\n\nThe same applies to rubbing, sleeping, crossing a river, down-pours of rain,\nthe conjuring of unlucky omens, unless they happened some time ago.\n\n40c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nIf several members of the body are to be rubbed, the verses required for the\npurpose are recited once only. A prayer is enjoined if one wakes during the\nnight. If one wakes more than once that prayer is. not to be repeated. In\ncrossing a river the necessary verse is not to be repeated at every wave, nor\nduring a down-pour, at every drop of rain. If some unlucky sight has to be\nconjured, the conjuring verse is spoken once and not repeated, unless some\ntime has elapsed and a new unlucky sight presents itself.\n\n41\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XLI.\n\nIn case of a journey, however, one hymn is used till the object (of the\njourney) has been accomplished.\n\n41c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nI read praya _n_ e tu-a-arthanirv _ri_ tte _h_. Another reading is arthani _v_\nritti _h_.\n\n42\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XLII.\n\nIt is the same also with regard to acts which do not produce an immediate\neffect.\n\n42c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe commentators distinguish between acts which\n\np. 327\n\nproduce a visible effect, such as pounding or sprinkling, and acts which do\nnot, such as addressing, approaching, looking. The latter are called asa _m_\nnipatin. Thus when the stones used for the preparation of Soma are addressed,\nthe hymn which is used for addressing them, is not repeated for each single\nstone, the same as in Sutra XL. Sutras XLI and XLII are sometimes joined.\n\n43\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XLIII.\n\nRepetition takes place in the case of the Havishk _ri_ t, Adhrigu,\nPuronuvakya, and Manota hymns, (because they have to be used) at different\ntimes.\n\n43c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nHavishk _ri_ t-adhrigu-puronuvakya-manotam is to be taken as a Dvandva\ncompound.\n\nThe Havishk _ri_ t hymn is an invocation when the havis is made. The Adhrigu\nhymn is 'Daivya _h_ _s_ amitara _h_ ,' &c. The Puronuvakya hymn is that which\nprecedes the Ya _g_ ya, immediately after the Sampraisha. The Manota hymn is\n'Tva _m_ hy agne prathamo manota,' &c. These hymns are to be repeated, if the\nact which they accompany has to be repeated after a certain interval.\n\n44\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XLIV.\n\nWhen it is expressly stated, one sacrificial act may be accompanied by many\nhymns.\n\n44c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThus we read, 'He takes the Abhri, the hoe, with four Mantras.'\n\n45\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XLV.\n\nOne ought to let the beginnings of a sacrificial act coincide with the end of\nthe Mantras.\n\np. 328\n\n45c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe mantra which indicates the nature and purpose of a sacrificial act should\ncome first, and as soon as it has been finished the act should follow. See\nKaty. I, 3, 5.\n\n46\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XLVI.\n\nIn the case of the aghara, sprinkling of clarified butter, and of dhara,\npouring out of Soma, the beginning of the mantra and the act takes place at\nthe same time.\n\n47\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XLVII.\n\nMantras are indicated by their first words.\n\n47c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThese first words are often called Pratikas, and rules are given in \xc3\x82 _s_\nvalayana's _S_ rauta-sutras I, 1, 17-19, as to the number of words that should\nform such a pratika, if it is meant for one verse, for three verses, or for a\nwhole hymn. According to \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana, if one foot is quoted, it is meant\nfor a verse; if an imperfect foot of an initial verse is quoted, it is meant\nfor a whole hymn; if more than a foot is quoted, it is meant for three verses.\n\n48\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XLVIII.\n\nOne should know that with the beginning of a following mantra, the former\nmantra is finished.\n\n49\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XLIX.\n\nIn the case of Hotra and Ya _g_ amana-mantras, an aggregation takes place.\n\n49c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nHotras are mantras recited by the Hot _ri_ -priest. Ya _g_ amanas are mantras\nrecited by the sacrificer himself. They are hymns which accompany, but do not\nenjoin any sacrificial act.\n\np. 329\n\n50\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA L.\n\nIn the case of the Ya _g_ yas and Anuvakyas this (the aggregation) is\noptional.\n\n50c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe Ya _g_ ya is explained by praya _k_ _kh_ ati ya _g_ yaya, the Anuvakya by\nahvayaty anuvakyaya. Sometimes more than one are mentioned, but in that case\nthe priest is free to do as he likes. According to the same principle, when we\nread that one should sacrifice with rice or with barley, that means that rice\nshould be used after the rice-harvest, barley after the barley-harvest, and\nnot that rice and barley should be used at the same time.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Sutras 51-75](sbe30121.htm)\n\n"
