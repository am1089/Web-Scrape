For the gods,\nhaving now appeased him by the _S_ atarudriya, thereby appeased him still\nfurther; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), now that he has appeased\nhim by the _S_ atarudriya, still further appease him thereby.\n\n9:1:2:22\\. With water he sprinkles him 1,--water is a means of appeasing\n(soothing): he thus appeases him thereby. He sprinkles him all over; he thus\nappeases him all over. Thrice he sprinkles,--threefold is Agni: as great as\nAgni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus appeases him.\n\n9:1:2:33\\. And, again, as to why he sprinkles him,--that Agni (the fire-\naltar), doubtless, is these worlds: by water he thus encompasses these worlds,\nby the ocean, indeed, he encompasses them. On every side (he sprinkles the\naltar): hence the ocean flows round these worlds on every side. From left to\nright (he sprinkles): hence the ocean flows round these worlds from left to\nright.\n\n9:1:2:44\\. For safety from injury it is the Agnidh who sprinkles, for the\nAgnidh is the same as Agni, and no one injures his own self. From a stone (he\nsprinkles), for from the rock water springs forth;--from the arm-pit, for from\nthe arm-pit water springs forth; from the right arm-pit 2, for from the right\narm-pit water springs forth.\n\np. 170\n\n9:1:2:55\\. [He sprinkles the stone, with, Va _g_. S. XVII, 1], 'The food that\nis lying in the rock, in the mountain,'--for that food, water, is indeed\ncontained in the rock, in the mountains;--'the drink that is gathered from\nwaters, plants and trees,'--for from all that that drink is indeed\ngathered;--'that sap and food bring ye unto us, O Maruts, as bountiful\ngivers!'--for the Maruts are the rulers of the rain. With 'In the rock is thy\nhunger,' he (after watering the altar) sets down (the pitcher on the stone):\nhe thus lays hunger into the stone, whence the stone is not fit for eating.\nBut hard also is the stone, and hard is hunger: he thus puts the hard along\nwith the hard. With, 'In me thy food!' he takes up (the pitcher): he thereby\ntakes up the food into his own self. Thus (he does) a second and a third time.\n\n9:1:2:66\\. Having (finally) set down the pitcher, he perambulates thrice (the\naltar); for when (in sprinkling) he walks all round it, he, as it were, makes\nlight of him (Agni-Rudra). He now makes amends to him, for (his own) safety.\n\n9:1:2:77\\. And, again, as to why he perambulates it,--he then (in sprinkling\nthe altar) goes after him 1 (Agni-Rudra): thereupon he now recovers his own\nself unto life, and so does he by that self of his obtain all vital power.\n\n9:1:2:88\\. Thrice he perambulates it, for thrice he walks round it (whilst\nsprinkling): thus as many times as he walks round it, so many times does he\nperambulate it.\n\np. 171\n\n9:1:2:99\\. Having thereupon put that stone into the water-pitcher, they throw\nit in that (south-western) direction, for that is Nir _ri_ ti's region: he\nthus consigns pain 1 to Nir _ri_ ti's region.\n\n9:1:2:1010\\. For at that time, the gods, having appeased him by the _S_\natarudriya and the water, thereby drove out his pain, his evil; and in like\nmanner does this (Sacrificer) now, after appeasing him by the _S_ atarudriya\nand the water, cast away his pain, his evil.\n\n9:1:2:1111\\. Outside the fire-altar he throws it; for this fire-altar indeed\nis the same as these (three) worlds: he thus puts pain outside these\nworlds;--outside the sacrificial ground (vedi); for the Vedi is this (earth):\nhe thus puts pain outside this earth.\n\n9:1:2:1212\\. Whilst standing at the right thigh of the Vedi, with his face to\nthe east, he throws it southwards, with, 'Let thy pain enter him whom we\nhate!' and thus its pain enters whomsoever he hates. He may say, 'Let thy pain\nenter so-and-so!' naming him whom he hates, and then he has no longer any hold\nupon him; but let him take no notice of this, for indicated of himself is he\nwhom he who knows this hates. If it 2 should remain unbroken, let him bid (the\nPratiprasthat _ri_ ) to break it; for only when it is broken, the pain enters\nhim whom he hates. They return (to the altar) without looking back: they thus\nleave pain and evil behind without looking back to them.\n\n9:1:2:1313\\. Having returned, he makes the bricks his own\n\np. 172\n\nmilch cows; for the gods, having now appeased him (Agni-Rudra) by the _S_\natarudriya and the water, and having driven out his pain and evil, returned\n(to the altar) and made the bricks their own milch cows; and in like manner\ndoes this (Sacrificer) now, after appeasing him by the _S_ atarudriya and the\nwater, and casting off his pain and evil, return and make the bricks his own\nmilch cows.\n\n9:1:2:1414\\. And some say, 'Let him make them his own whilst sitting, for\nsitting one milks the cow.' But let him rather make them his own standing; for\nthat fire-altar is these worlds, and these worlds are, as it were, standing.\nAnd, moreover, one is stronger whilst standing.\n\n9:1:2:1515\\. [He does so], whilst standing (near the right thigh of the altar)\nwith his face towards the north-east; in front stands that cow by the\nSacrificer with her face towards the west (back), for from the right side they\napproach the cow which stands with its face towards the back (west).\n\n9:1:2:1616\\. And wherever he reaches (whilst stretching his arms over the\naltar), there he touches it and mutters this formula (Va _g_. S. XVII, 2),\n'Let these bricks be mine own milch cows, O Agni!' for Agni rules over this\nmaking of cows, whence he addresses Agni out of so many deities;--'One, and\nten 1 . . . . and a hundred thousand millions, and a billion;'--for the one,\nto wit, one and ten, is the lowest quantity, and the other, to wit, a hundred\nthousand millions, and a billion, is the highest quantity; thus, having\ncomprehended them by the\n\np. 173\n\nlowest and the highest quantity, the gods made them their own milch cows; and\nin like manner does this (Sacrificer), having thus comprehended them by the\nlowest and the highest quantity, make them his own milch cows. Hence also he\nneed not care to make many (cows) his own 1, for in yonder world that\n(Sacrificer), by means of the Brahman (holy writ), the Ya _g_ us, will make\nmany (cows) his own. And in that he carries on (the numbers) uninterruptedly,\nthereby he carries on, without interruption, his objects of desire.\n\n9:1:2:1717\\. And as to why he makes the bricks his own milch cows,--this fire-\naltar is speech, for with speech it is built up; and when he says, 'One, and\nten, . . . and a hundred thousand millions, and a billion,'--'one' is speech,\nand a hundred thousand millions is speech, and a billion is speech: it is\nSpeech herself that the gods thereby made their own milch cow; and in like\nmanner does the Sacrificer thereby make Speech herself his own milch cow. And\nin that he carries on (the numbers) uninterruptedly, thereby it is Speech\nherself that he carries on:--'Let these bricks be mine own milch cows, O Agni,\nhereafter in yonder world!' He thereby makes them his own milch cows in this\nworld, and he also makes them his own milch cows in yonder world; and thus\nthey are profitable to him in both worlds, in this one and in the other.\n\n9:1:2:1818\\. [Va _g_. S. XVII, 3], 'The seasons ye are,'--for these (bricks)\nare indeed the seasons;--'law-sustaining,' that is, 'truth-sustaining;'--'be\nye season-abiding, law-sustaining!--for the bricks\n\np. 174\n\nare the days and nights, and the days and nights indeed abide in the\nseasons;--'fat-showering, honey-showering,'--he thereby makes them fat-\nshowering and honey-showering for himself.\n\n9:1:2:1919\\. 'The widely-shining by name,'--for the gods then called those\nbricks to them by their names, and in the same way in which they called them,\nthey turned unto them; but the 'space-fillers' alone stood with averted faces\ndischarging water, having no names applied to them. They called them by the\nname 'the widely-shining,' and they turned unto them. Hence, each time he has\nlaid down ten bricks, he addresses them with the 'space-filling 1 (verse)': he\nthereby makes them widely-shining (vira _g_ ), for the Vira _g_ (metre)\nconsists of ten syllables:--'wish-milking, never-failing,'--he thereby makes\nthem wish-milking and never-failing.\n\n9:1:2:2020\\. He then draws a frog, a lotus-flower, and a bamboo-shoot across\n(the central part of the altar). For the gods having now appeased him by the\n_S_ atarudriya and the water, and having driven out his pain and evil, thereby\nstill further appeased him; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), now\nthat he has appeased him by the _S_ atarudriya and the water, and driven out\nhis pain and evil, still further appease him thereby. In every direction he\ndraws them: he thus appeases him everywhere.\n\n9:1:2:2121\\. And, again, as to why he draws them across. Now, in the\nbeginning, when the _Ri_ shis, the vital airs, made up that Agni 2, they\nsprinkled him with water: that water dripped off and became the frogs.\n\np. 175\n\n9:1:2:2222\\. They (the waters) said to Pra _g_ apati, 'Whatever moisture 1 we\nhad, has gone down.' He said, 'This tree shall know it!'--he shall know\n(vettu), he shall taste it (sa _m_ vettu)--that one, indeed, they mystically\ncall 'vetasa' (bamboo), for the gods love the mystic. And because they said,\n'Down (avak) has gone our moisture (ka),' they became avakkas;--'avakkas,'\nthey mystically call 'avakas (lotuses),' for the gods love the mystic. These,\nthen, are those three kinds of water, to wit, the frog, the lotus-flower, and\nthe bamboo-shoot: by means of these three kinds of water he appeases him.\n\n9:1:2:2323\\. And, again, why he draws them across it;--when he (Agni, the\nfire-altar) is built up, he is being born, and he is born for every kind of\nfood; and these are every kind of food, to wit, the frog, the lotus-flower,\nand the bamboo-shoot, for these, indeed, are animals, water, and trees: with\nall this food he gratifies him.\n\n9:1:2:2424\\. With the frog, on the part of animals, whence, of animals, the\nfrog is the one affording least subsistence, for he is used up;--with the\nlotus-flower, on the part of water, whence of the kinds of water (plants),\nlotus-flowers are those affording least subsistence, for they are used\nup;--and with the bamboo-shoot, on the part of trees; whence, of trees, the\nbamboo is the one affording least subsistence, for it is used up.\n\n9:1:2:2525\\. Having tied them to a cane, he, in the first place, draws them\neastwards along the right (south) part of the (body of the) altar inside the\nenclosing-stones,\n\np. 176\n\nwith (Va _g_. S. XVII, 4), 'With the lotus-flower of the ocean we encompass\nthee, O Agni: be thou bright and propitious unto us!' that is, 'With the\nwaters of the ocean we appease thee.'\n\n9:1:2:2626\\. Then northwards along the hind part (of the altar), with (Va _g_.\nS. XVII, 5), 'With an outer vesture of cold we encompass thee, O Agni: be thou\nbright and propitious unto us!'--that part of the cold which is frozen hard is\nan outer vesture of cold: thus, 'By the frozen part of cold we appease thee!'\n\n9:1:2:2727\\. Then eastwards along the left (north) part, with (Va _g_. S.\nXVII, 6), 'Upon the earth, into the reed, into the rivers descend thou, O\nAgni, thou art the bile 1 of waters: with them, come thou, O she-frog, and\nmake the sacrifice bright-coloured and propitious for us!' as the text, so the\nmeaning.\n\n9:1:2:2828\\. Then southwards along the forepart, with (Va _g_. S. XVII, 7),\n'Thou art the receptacle of waters, the abode of the ocean: let thy darts burn\nothers than us! unto us be thou bright and propitious!' as the text, so the\nmeaning. He first draws them thus 2, then thus, then thus, then thus: that is\nfrom left to right, for so it is with the gods.\n\n9:1:2:2929\\. Over the body (of the altar) he draws them\n\np. 177\n\nfirst, for of (the bird, or Agni) that is born the body is born first, then\nthe right wing, then the tail, then the left wing: that is from left to right,\nfor so it is with the gods.\n\n9:1:2:3030\\. Over the wings and tail he draws them in the direction of the\nbody (self): he thus lays calmness into his own self;--from the further end\n(he draws) hitherwards: he thus lays calmness into his own self from the\nfurther end hitherwards. The right wing, with (Va _g_. S. XVII, 8), 'O bright\nAgni, with thy light, (with thy dainty tongue, O god, bring hither the gods,\nand worship them)!' The tail, with (Va _g_. S. XVII, 9), 'O bright and shining\nAgni, (bring hither the gods to our sacrifice and our offering)!' The left\nwing, with (Va _g_. S. XVII, 10), 'He who with bright and glittering light\n(shineth upon the earth, as the dawns with their glow, who, the ever young,\nspeeding, as in the race, in the battle, of the steed, thirsteth not in the\nheat).' 'Bright,' he says each time, for whatever is kindly and propitious is\nbright: he thus propitiates him thereby.\n\n9:1:2:3131\\. With seven (formulas) he draws them across,--the altar consists\nof seven layers, and seven seasons are a year, and Agni is the year: as great\nas Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus crosses him.\nHaving thrown the cane on the heap of rubbish;--\n\n9:1:2:3232\\. [The Adhvaryu] then sings hymns round it (the altar);--for\ntherein that whole Agni is completed; and the gods laid into him that highest\nform, immortality; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) thereby lay into\nhim that highest form, immortality. Saman-hymns are (used), for samans are\nvital airs,\n\np. 178\n\nand the vital airs are immortality: immortality, that highest form, he thus\nlays into him. On every side he sings around it: everywhere he thus lays\nimmortality, that highest form, into him.\n\n9:1:2:3333\\. And, again, as to why he sings saman-hymns round about it;--the\ngods then desired, 'Let us make this body of ours boneless and immortal.' They\nspake, 'Think ye upon this, how we may make this body of ours boneless and\nimmortal!' They spake, 'Meditate ( _k_ it) ye!' whereby indeed they meant to\nsay, 'Seek ye a layer ( _k_ iti)! seek ye how we may make this body of ours\nboneless and immortal!\n\n9:1:2:3434\\. Whilst meditating, they saw those saman-hymns, and sang them\nround about it, and by means of them they made that body of theirs boneless\nand immortal; and in like manner does the Sacrificer, when he sings the saman-\nhymns round about it, make that body of his boneless and immortal. On every\nside he sings: everywhere he thus makes that body of his boneless and\nimmortal. Standing he sings, for these worlds stand, as it were; and whilst\nstanding one doubtless is stronger. He sings, after uttering (the syllable)\n'hi _m_ ,' for therein the saman-hymn becomes whole and complete.\n\n9:1:2:3535\\. He first sings the Gayatra hymn 1, for the Gayatri metre is Agni:\nhe thus makes Agni his\n\np. 179\n\nhead, and that head of his (or of him, Agni) he thus makes boneless and\nimmortal.\n\n9:1:2:3636\\. The Rathantara 1 (hymn he sings) at the right wing; for the\nRathantara is this (earth), and this (earth), doubtless, is the most essential\n(rasatama) of these worlds, for it is in her that all these essences (rasa)\nare contained, and 'rasantama,' indeed, they call mystically, 'rathantara,'\nfor the gods love the mystic: he thus makes this (earth) his right wing, and\nthat right wing of his he thus makes boneless and immortal.\n\n9:1:2:3737\\. The B _ri_ hat 1 (hymn he sings) at the left wing; the B _ri_ hat\n(great), doubtless, is the sky, for the sky is the greatest (of worlds): he\nthus makes the sky his (Agni's) left wing, and that left wing of his he thus\nmakes boneless and immortal.\n\n9:1:2:3838\\. The Vamadevya 1 (hymn he sings) on the body (of the altar); for\nthe Vamadevya is the breath, and the breath is air (vayu, the wind), and he,\nVayu, doubtless, is the self (body) of all the gods: he thus makes the air\n(wind) his body, and that body of his he thus makes boneless and immortal.\n\n9:1:2:3939\\. The Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ aya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iya 1 (hymn he sings) near the\ntail;--the Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ aya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iya, doubtless, is the moon; for whenever a\nsacrifice becomes completed 2, the essence of its oblations goes up to him\n(the moon);\n\np. 180\n\nand inasmuch as sacrifice after sacrifice (ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a) goes up to him, the\nmoon is the Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ aya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iya: he thus makes the moon his (Agni's)\ntail, and that tail of his he thus makes boneless and immortal.\n\n9:1:2:4040\\. He then sings the heart of Pra _g_ apati 1;--the heart assuredly\nis yonder sun, for he (the sun) is smooth, and the heart is smooth; he is\nround, and the heart is round. On the body (of the altar) he sings, for the\nheart is in the body;--at the armpit 2, for the heart is in (the vicinity of)\nthe armpit;--\n\np. 181\n\nat the right armpit, for the heart is nearer thereto 1: he thus makes the sun\nhis (Agni's) heart, and that heart of his he thus makes boneless and immortal.\n\n9:1:2:4141\\. He sings about offspring (pra _g_ a) and Pra _g_ apati (the lord\nof creatures and procreation);--when he sings about offspring, he lays the\nheart into offspring; and when he sings about Pra _g_ apati, he lays the heart\ninto Agni.\n\n9:1:2:4242\\. And, again, as to why he sings about offspring and Pra _g_\napati;--this Agni, doubtless, is both offspring and the lord of offspring, and\nhence, when he sings about Agni, he lays the heart both into the offspring and\ninto the lord of offspring.\n\n9:1:2:4343\\. These (hymns) are the immortal bricks; he lays them down last\n(highest) of all:--he thereby makes immortality the highest thing of all this\n(universe), and hence immortality is the highest thing of all this (universe).\nLet none other but the Adhvaryu 2 sing; for these (hymns) are bricks, and he\n(Agni, the fire-altar) would be built up in the wrong way 3, were any other\nthan the Adhvaryu to sing.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[169:1](sbe4331.htm#fr_290) Or rather, he pours water on it (the altar).\n\n[169:2](sbe4331.htm#fr_291) That is, from the lower (or hindmost) point where\nthe right p. 170 wing joins the body of the altar. Re there places a stone,\nfrom which he begins the sprinkling of the altar.\n\n[170:1](sbe4331.htm#fr_292) See [IX, I, 1, 33](sbe4330.htm#9:1:1:33).\n\n[171:1](sbe4331.htm#fr_293) The burning heat of the fire, and all physical and\nmental suffering.\n\n[171:2](sbe4331.htm#fr_294) Viz. the stone, or the pot, according to others;\ncf. Katy. _S_ rautas. XVIII, 2, 5-8. According to Prof. Weber the stone is\nmeant to represent the hungry greed of the fire.\n\n[172:1](sbe4331.htm#fr_295) The intervening numbers here omitted increase by\nmultiples of ten.\n\n[173:1](sbe4331.htm#fr_296) ? That is to say, he need not touch the altar more\nthan once.\n\n[174:1](sbe4331.htm#fr_297) That is with the verse Va _g_. S. XII, 54,\nbeginning 'Lokam p _ri_ _n_ a,' 'Fill thou the space;' see part iii, p. 153\nnote.\n\n[174:2](sbe4331.htm#fr_298) See VI, 1, 1, 1-5.\n\n[175:1](sbe4331.htm#fr_299) Thus, or essence (ra _s_ a), according to Saya _n_\na; cf. [X, 6, 5, 1](sbe4375.htm#10:6:5:1). The word 'ka' has, however, also\nthe meaning 'joy.'\n\n[176:1](sbe4331.htm#fr_300) That is, 'the heat' which is considered the chief\nproperty of the bilious humour.\n\n[176:2](sbe4331.htm#fr_301) The procedure in this case is an exact counterpart\nof the ploughing of the altar-site, for which see VII, 2, 2, 8-12, with notes.\nHence also the verbs expressive of the two actions are closely analogous, viz.\nvik _ri_ shati and vikarshati.\n\n[178:1](sbe4331.htm#fr_302) The Gayatra-saman is the hymn-tune composed on the\nverse called 'the Gayatri,' _par excellence_ , or 'Savitri' (tat savitur\nvarenyam, Rig-veda III, 62, 10), which plays an important part in the\nreligious fife of the Hindu. The verse, as figured for chanting, is given,\nSama-v. Calc. ed. vol. v, p. 60 1. On the present occasion, according to La\n_t_ y. _S_ r. I, 5, 11, a different text, viz. Sama-v. II, 8, 14 ( _Ri_ g-veda\nIX, 66, 19, agna ayu _m_ shi payase), is to be sung to this tune.\n\n[179:1](sbe4331.htm#fr_306) The Rathantara, B _ri_ hat, Vamadevya, and Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ aya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iya tunes are apparently to be sung here on their original\ntexts (Sama-v. II, 30, 31, abhi tva _s_ ura nonuma _h_ ; II, 159, 160, tvam id\ndhi havamahe; II, 32, 33, kaya na _s_ _k_ itra a bhuvat; and II, 53, 54, ya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a-ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a vo agnaye), though hardly in their elaborate setting,\nas performed in chanting.\n\n[179:2](sbe4331.htm#fr_307) It should be remembered that the chanting of the\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ aya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iya (or Agnish _t_ oma)-saman marks the completion (sa\n_m_ stha) of the ordinary (Agnish _t_ oma) Soma-sacrifice.\n\n[180:1](sbe4331.htm#fr_308) The Pra _g_ apati-h _ri_ daya, or Pra _g_ apater h\n_ri_ dayam, as figured for chanting, is given, Sama-v. Calc. ed. vol. ii, p.\n499. It consists of the words, ima _h_ pra _g_ a _h_ pra _g_ apate(r) h _ri_\ndayam pra _g_ arupam a _g_ i _g_ ane, with inserted stobhas and modulations.\nIt is followed by a simpler form, which is perhaps the one used on the present\noccasion.\n\n[180:2](sbe4331.htm#fr_309) Viz. on the place where the right wing joins the\nbody of the altar. According to other authorities, the _S_ yaita hymn-tune is\nlikewise to be sung near the left arm-pit (or, according to Sa _n_ _d_ ilya,\nat the place where the Adhvaryu mounts the altar). For other variations, see\nWeber, Ind. Stud. XIII, p. 276. I do not think that the ritual of the White Ya\n_g_ us, in omitting the left arm-pit, shows any gap or inconsistency, since\nthe right arm-pit is marked out, not for any bodily parallelism, but for the\nsimple reason that it is supposed to indicate the position of the heart.\nWhilst all the other places on which hymns are sung are essential parts of the\nbird Agni, the arm-pit is not an essential part, but is merely indicative of\nthe central organ of the body. La _t_ y. I, 5, 11 seqq. supplies the following\ndirections, apparently implying a somewhat different order of procedure from\nthat followed in our text: He passes along the south, and whilst standing\n(east of the altar) with his face towards the west, he sings the Gayatra at\nthe head. Returning, he sings the Rathantara at the right wing. Going round\nbehind, he sings the B _ri_ hat at the left wing. Going back, and standing\nbehind the tail, with his face towards the east, he sings the Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ aya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iya. The Vamadevya he sings at the right, and the Pra _g_ apati-h _ri_\ndaya at the left, arm-pit. Then follow different views held by different\nteachers.--With this ceremony, by which homage is paid to the different parts\nof Agni-Pra _g_ apati's body, compare the similar, but more elaborate,\nceremony of the Parimada _h_ at the Mahavrata, [X, 1, 2,\n9](sbe4346.htm#10:1:2:9) with note.\n\n[181:1](sbe4331.htm#fr_310) That is, by taking the auricles as parts of the\nheart.\n\n[181:2](sbe4331.htm#fr_311) According to La _t_ y. I, 5, 1 seq., it is the\nPrastot _ri_ who sings these samans. A similar conflict of competence in this\nrespect is referred to not only in regard to detached samans (cf. Katy.
