Speech is his (the breath's) rope, the names the knots 2. Thus by his\nspeech as by a rope, and by his names as by knots, all this is bound. For all\nthis are names indeed, and with speech he calls everything.\n\n2\\. People carry him who knows this, as if they were bound by a rope.\n\n3\\. Of the body of the breath thus meditated on, the Ush _n_ ih verse forms\nthe hairs, the Gayatri the skin, the Trish _t_ ubh the flesh, the Anush _t_\nubh the muscles, the _G_ agati the bone, the Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti the marrow, the B _ri_\nhati the breath 3 (pra _n_ a). He is covered with the verses (kha _n_ _d_ as,\nmetres). Because he is thus covered with verses, therefore they call them kha\n_n_ _d_ as (coverings, metres).\n\n4\\. If a man knows the reason why kha _n_ _d_ as are called kha _n_ _d_ as,\nthe verses cover him in whatever place he likes against any evil deed.\n\np. 210\n\n5\\. This is said by a _Ri_ shi (Rv. I, 164, 13):--\n\n6\\. 'I saw (the breath) as a guardian, never tiring, coming and going on his\nways (the arteries). That breath (in the body, being identified with the sun\namong the Devas), illuminating the principal and intermediate quarters of the\nsky, is returning constantly in the midst of the worlds.'\n\nHe says: 'I saw a guardian,' because he, the breath, is a guardian, for he\nguards everything.\n\n7\\. He says: 'Never tiring,' because the breath never rests.\n\n8\\. He says: 'Coming and going on his ways,' because the breath comes and goes\non his ways.\n\n9\\. He says: 'Illuminating the principal and intermediate,' because he\nilluminates these only, the principal and intermediate quarters of the sky.\n\n10\\. He says. 'He is returning constantly in the midst of the worlds,' because\nhe returns indeed constantly in the midst of the worlds.\n\n11\\. And then, there is another verse (Rv. I, 55, 81): 'They are covered like\ncaves by those who make them,'\n\n12\\. For all this is covered indeed by breath.\n\n13\\. This ether is supported by breath as B _ri_ hati, and as this ether is\nsupported by breath as B _ri_ hati, so one should know that all things, not\nexcepting ants, are supported by breath as B _ri_ hati.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[209:2](sbe01207.htm#fr_521) The rope is supposed to be the chief rope to\nwhich various smaller ropes are attached for fastening animals.\n\n[209:3](sbe01207.htm#fr_522) Here conceived as the air breathed, not as the\ndeity.
