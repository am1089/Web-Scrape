Vyasa said :-- O King! When the vessel filled with the Soma juice was\ngiven to the two As'vins, Indra became very angry and showing his strength,\nspoke thus to the Muni Chyavana. O Brahma _n_ a! Never will you be able to\nendow him with such a high honour. When you have shewn towards me your enmity,\nI will kill you, no doubt, exactly like Vis'varupa.\n\n\n\n3-4. Chyavana said :-- \xc2\x93O Indra! Do not insult the two highsouled As'vins.\nThey have given me beauty, youth and lustre and made me look like a second\nDeva. O Lord of the Devas! Just as the other Devas can take the vessel of Soma\nexcluding you, so the two powerful As'vins can do the same towards you.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n5\\. Indra said :-- \xc2\x93They are the physicians; so they cannot in any way have\nthe right to accept the Soma cup. I will just now sever your head.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n6-29. Vyasa said :-- O Ornament to the race of Bharata! At these words of\nIndra, the Muni made the As'vins accept the Soma cup, thus highly insulting,\nas it were, Indra and not taking any notice of his words. When the two As'vins\naccepted the cup with a desire to drink the Soma thereof, the powerful Indra\nsaw it and said :-- \xc2\x93If you make them drink Soma out of your own necessity, I\nwill hurl thunderbolt on your head exactly in the same way as I did towards\nVis'varupa.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\np. 617\n\n\n\nThe Muni became violently angry at this and made the As'vins drink the Soma\naccording to due rites and ceremonies. Indra, too, angrily hurled thunderbolt\non him in the presence of all the Devas. The weapon shed lustre like million\nSuns. Seeing the thunderbolt hurled on him, the powerful Muni made the Indra's\nthunderbolt stand stock still by virtue of his Tapas. The powerful Muni then\nadopted black magic to kill Indra and offered oblations of clarified butter\nand grains, purified by Mantrams, in the Fire. By the Tapas of Chyavana, of\nunbounded lustre, there sprang from the sacrificial hearth Kritya (A female\ndeity to whom sacrifices are offered for destructive and magical purposes).\nAnd out of Kritya originated a very strong person, very cruel and of huge\nbody, a great Demon. The horrible Demon, named Mada, was terrifying to all the\nbeings. His body was huge like a mountain, teeth very sharp and terrible. Four\nteeth were hundred Yojanas long each, and his other teeth were ten Yojanas\nlong. His arms were like mountains, very long and fierce; tongue, horrible,\nrough and so very long that it reached up to the heavens. His throat was like\na mountain peak hard and of a furious appearance; nails resembled tiger's,\nhairs horrible. His body was jet black like lamp black; face very terrible,\neyes bright like the conflagration fire and awful. One of his jaws touched the\nground and the other touched the heaven. Thus was born the Demon, named Mada,\nof huge form. Looking at him, the Devas became suddenly frightened; Indra,\ntoo, got very much terrified at the sight of him and did not want to have any\nmore fight. The Demon swallowed Indra's thunderbolt, looked at the sky, and\nstood up as if to swallow at once the whole Universe. He became infuriated\nwith rage and pursued Indra to devour him. Seeing this, the Devas cried aloud\n:-- \xc2\x93Alas! We are slain.\xc2\x94 Indra had his arms disabled by Mantrams and so he\ncould not hurl his thunderbolt though he wanted to do so. The Lord of the\nDevas, then, with thunderbolt in his hand, looked on the Demon as Death\npersonified and remembered his Guru, skilled in the knowledge which is the\nproper time to perform a certain thing. The liberal-minded Brihaspati knowing\nthe time of imminent danger, and that he is remembered by Indra, at once came\nto the spot. He then judged what to do in the present crisis and told Indra\n:-- \xc2\x93O Indra! This cannot be averted even by Mantrams; what to speak of\nthunderbolt! This powerful Asura Mada has arisen from the sacrificial hearth\nby virtue of the Tapas of the Chyavana Muni. The Muni's power is especially\nfelt here. O Lord of the Devas! Nobody, You, I, nor any other Deva will be\nable to resist him. Know this. Even Brahma cannot thwart the anger of one who\nis devoted to the S'akti, the Highest Force; Chyavana is the Bhakta of the\nHighest S'akti. So no\n\n\n\np. 618\n\n\n\nother body is able to defeat him. He is the man himself to take back the\nKritya that he has originated. There is no doubt in this. So it is better for\nyou now to take the shelter of the Muni.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n30-52. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing thus from his Guru, Indra went to the\nMuni and bowed down shuddering, before him. \xc2\x93O Muni! Forgive me and stop the\nAsura from his intention to slay the Devas. O All knowing One! Be pleased, I\nwill keep your words. O Bhargava! The two As'vins will, from this day, have\nthe right to drink the Some juice. This I speak out to you in truth. O Brahma\n_n_ a! Be graciously pleased unto me. O Ascetic! Your intention will never be\nbaffled. Especially I know you to be a knower of Dharma; so, you will never be\nable to make your word swerve from truth. The two As'vins will, by your grace,\nbe able to drink always the Soma cup; and the King S'aryati's fame will also\nknow no bounds. O Muni! Know that what I have done is simply to test your\nprowess in Tapas. O Brahma _n_ a! Now do this favour to me and take back your,\nthis Demon Mada, sprung from your sacrificial hearth and thus do good to all\nthe Devas. There is no doubt in this.\xc2\x94 Thus spoken piteously by Indra,\nChyavana, who knew the Highest Reality, drew back within himself the anger\narising from the enmity with Indra. Then the Mahar _s_ i Chyavana consoled the\nDevas that were very much perplexed and anxious out of terror of the Demon\nnamed Mada and divided the Asura into four parts (1) female sex, (2) drinking,\n(3) gambling and (4) hunting animals. When Mada was thus divided into four\nparts, the terror stricken Devas felt themselves relieved and saved and got\nconsoled. Chyavana then placed the Devas in their respective stations and\ncompleted the sacrifice. As last, the religious Bhargava made first Indra and\nthen the two As'vins drink the Soma Cups. O King! Thus Chyavana had the\nAs'vins their Soma Cups by virtue of his power of Tapas. Thence the tank with\nthe sacrificial post Yupa became famous and the Muni's \xc3\x82s'rama also was\nrenowned and honoured in all respects. The King S'aryati, too, became very\nglad at this sacrifice and completing the sacrifice returned with his\nministers to his city. The Manu's son, the powerful religious King S'aryati\ngoverned his kingdom, free from any obstacles or other enemies. He had one son\nnamed \xc3\x82narta; and \xc3\x82narta had a son named Revata born to him.\n\n\n\nRevata built the city of Kus'asthali in the midst of the ocean and began to\nlive there. He enjoyed all the things in the countries named \xc3\x82narta and\nothers. Revata had one hundred sons of whom Kakudmi was the eldest and of pure\ncharacter. He had one daughter very beautiful named Revati, endowed with all\nauspicious qualities. When the daughter reached a marriageable age, the King\nbegan to think where he\n\n\n\np. 619\n\n\n\ncould get a prince of a good noble family. That powerful King began to govern\nhis people \xc3\x82nartas, with his headquarters at the Raivata hill. \xc2\x93Whom to\nbetroth this daughter,\xc2\x94 the King thought and settled that he would go to\nBrahma and ask him, the venerable omniscient Prajapati, worshipped by the\nDevas. Thus the King went with his daughter Revati to the Brahmaloka. There\nthe Devas, Yaj\xc3\xb1as, Vedas, mountains, oceans and rivers all were shining with\nluminous bodies. There the eternal Ri _s_ is, Siddhas, Gandharbas, Pannagas\nand Charanas were singing hymns to Brahma, standing with folded hands.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Seventh Chapter of the Seventh Book on the twin As'vins drinking\nthe Soma Cup in S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, the Maha Pura _n_ am of 18,000\nverses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 8](bk07ch08.htm)\n\n"
