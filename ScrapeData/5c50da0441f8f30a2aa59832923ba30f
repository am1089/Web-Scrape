But out on the chill edge of the Ganges, as darkness comes on,\nthe tiny bark lies drifting, hither and thither, scarcely determined betwixt\nebb and flow, as we with a few of the children launched it an hour ago. It was\nearly still when we went down to the riverside, and as we turned away only one\nworshipper had arrived besides ourselves--a solitary girl of eleven or twelve\n--to send her offering out to the Great Unknown. We stayed awhile then and\nwatched her, as she carefully removed the sacramental food from the birch-bark\nvessel, set in the stern the little light, and then floated it boldly out upon\nthe waters. And after that, what could we do but stay and watch and watch,\nwith breathless interest, as long as ever the star shone clear in the fragile\ncraft which, we knew, with the turn of the tide, would reach the main current\nand be carried far out to sea? O! innumerable fleet of little nameless boats,\nfloating on ponds and rivers, in all the villages of Bengal to-night,\n\np. 210\n\neach bearing its twinkling lamp into the all-enshrouding dark, how like ye are\nto life, how like to death!\n\nFor this is the last day of the Bengal month of _Pous_. It is the old-time day\nfor pilgrimage to Ganga-Sagar--that island where the river meets the sea, And\nmore than this, it is the day of prayer for all travellers, all wanderers from\ntheir homes, for all whose footsteps at nightfall shall not lead to their own\ndoor. It was in a crowded street this morning, as I passed the end of a small\nbazaar, that I noticed the eager faces and hurrying feet of men and women,\nhastening to carry to those at home the ships of flowers. They were rude\nenough, these little ships, that I too bought, to load with spoil of loving\nthought. Roughly pinned together they were, made of the shining white core of\nthe plantain-stalk, and masted and arched from stem to stern with splinters of\nbamboo, run through the hearts of yellow marigolds. Here and there the dealers\nhad made feint to imitate more closely, with coloured paper flags and string,\nthe sails and cordage of the old country boats. But for the most part they\nwere mere suggestions, glistening vessel and burning-hearted flowers.\n\nMere suggestions, truly--but of what! Can we not see the quiet women, sitting\nabsorbed before the symbol at their feet, loading it with offerings\n\np. 211\n\n[paragraph continues] \\-- _bel_ -leaves, flowers, the consecrated fruits and\ngrain, and praying with each fresh gift for some beloved life, that through\nthe coming year it might go safe amidst whatever tide, that even now, if peril\nsomewhere threaten it, it may be led safe home? Have we not here to-day the\nperfect picture of Humanity--Man battling on the distant frontier-line of\ntoilsome life; and Woman--for love\'s sake, not for God\'s--holding fast to\nprayer?\n\nOne thinks of the cry of the Jew, sonorous through the ages--the Jew, who\nloved not the sea, but lifted his eyes to the hills, to find his help, and\nlost himself, between "I" and "thee," in an inflood of blessedness: "The Lord\nshall preserve thy going out and thy coming in, from this time forth, and even\nfor evermore." One thinks of the churches of Brittany, and the small model of\na ship, _barque de ma vie_ , that hangs before every altar and in every\nprivate oratory. And there comes back the echo of the sailor\'s cry, amid surf\nand storm, _Sainte Anne! Sainte Anne!_  \n\nHere too, in Bengal, we have a maritime people, once great among the world\'s\nseafarers, and here, on the last day of _Pous_ , we celebrate the opening of\nthe annual commercial season, the old-time going forth of merchant enterprise\nand exploration. It was a traffic cut off from that of Phoenicia, and all the\nwell-omened\n\np. 212\n\npeoples of the Middle Sea, but unmistakably great in the East. China and\nJapan, Cambodia and Burma, have welcomed the coming of the Bengal mariners to\ntheir ports, being glad to win honour and wealth thereby. Fa Hian, Hiouen-\nTsang, and I-Ching are but three names, out of countless hosts to whom they\nbelonged, who sought the shores of India, or left them, in the name of the\nknowledge and impulse that she had power to send to other and less favoured\npeoples. But why cast our memory so far back? It is little more than a hundred\nyears since Indian shipbuilding was famous through the world. Even now the\nwooden shipping that still plies between the small countries of north-western\nEurope is in great part discarded craft of Indian building and of Indian teak.\nAnd how should these eastern vessels have won renown if the merchants and\nsailors of India had not been great to man and use?\n\nAll day long, from the altar-shelf above my desk, the marigolds, like an arch\nof sanctuary-lamps, have shone down upon me, and stirred a maze, a multitude,\nof dreams and memories in heart and brain. "The Lord bless--the Lord bless--\ngoing out--coming in--even for evermore!" Do we not stand, even as here, on\nthe river shores of life, and watch the going forth of beloved souls into the\nperils of the world\'s high seas, yea, into the far space and mystery of death?\n\np. 213\n\n[paragraph continues] Yet hold we by that very light, so like a star, they\ncarry at their prow, that how distant soever be the journey set, they shall\nnot pass beyond the reach of this our love and prayer, nor break outside the\nencircling barriers of the heart of God.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinted by BALLANTYNE, HANSOM & Co.  \nat Paul\'s Work, Edinburgh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
