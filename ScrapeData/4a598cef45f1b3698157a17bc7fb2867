Griffith, [1899], at\nsacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 148\n\n### BOOK THE SEVENTEENTH.\n\nTHE food and strength contained in stone and mountain,  \ndrink gathered from the plants and trees and waters,  \nThat food and strength, Maruts! free-givers, grant us.  \nIn the stone is thy hunger. In me is thy food. Let thy  \npain reach the man we hate.  \n2 O Agni, may these bricks be mine own milch kine: one, and  \nten, and ten tens, a hundred, and ten hundreds, a thousand,  \nand ten thousand a myriad, and a hundred thousand,  \nand a million, and a hundred millions, and an ocean middle  \nand end, and a hundred thousand millions, and a billion.  \nMay these bricks be mine own milch-kine in yonder world  \nand in this world.  \n3 Ye are the Seasons, strengthening Law, fixed in due season,  \nstrengthening Law,  \nCalled Splendid, dropping butter down and honey, yielders  \nof every wish, imperishable.  \n4 With the lake's mantling need we robe thee, Agni: to us  \nhe purifying and auspicious.  \n5 With cold's investing garb we gird thee, Agni: to us be purifying  \nand auspicious.\n\np. 149\n\n6 Descend upon the earth, the reed, the rivers: thou art the  \ngall, O Agni, of the waters.  \nWith them come hither, female Frog, and render this sacrifice  \nof ours bright-hued, successful.  \n7 This is the place where waters meet; here is the gathering  \nof the flood.  \nLet thy shaft burn others than us: be thou cleanser, propitious  \nunto us.  \n8 O Agni, purifier, God, with splendour and thy pleasant  \ntongue  \nBring hither, and adore, the Gods.  \n9 So, Agni, purifying, bright, bring hither to our sacrifice,  \nTo our oblation bring the Gods.  \n10 He who with purifying, eye-attracting form hath shone upon  \nthe earth as with the light of Dawn;  \nWho speeding on, as in the fleet steed's race, in fight, cometh  \nuntouched by age, as one athirst in heat.  \n11 Obeisance to thy wrath and glow! Obeisance to thy fiery  \nflame!  \nLet thy shot missiles burn others than us: be thou cleanser,  \npropitious unto us.  \n12 To him who dwells in man, Hail! To him who dwells in  \nwaters, Hail!  \nTo him who dwells in sacred grass, Hail! To him who dwells  \nin the wood, Hail! To him who finds the light, Hail!\n\np. 150\n\n13 Worshipful Gods of Gods who merit worship, those who sit  \ndown beside their yearly portion,  \nLet them who eat not sacrificial presents drink in this rite  \nof honey and of butter.  \n14 Those Gods who have attained to Godhead over Gods, they  \nwho have led the way in this our holy work,  \nWithout whose aid no body whatsoever moves, not on heaven's  \nheights are they, nor on the face of earth.  \n15 Giver of breath, of out-breath, breath diffusive, giver of  \nlustre, giving room and freedom,  \nLet thy shot missiles burn others than us: be thou cleanser,  \npropitious unto us.  \n16 May Agni with his sharpened blaze cast down each fierce  \ndevouring fiend.  \nMay Agni win us wealth by war.  \n17 He who sate down as Hotar priest, the Rishi, our Father  \noffering, up all things existent  \nHe, seeking with his wish a great possession, came among  \nmen on earth as archetypal.  \n18 What was the place whereon he took his station? What was  \nit that upheld him? What the manner,  \nWhence Visvakarman, seeing all, producing the earth, with  \nmighty power disclosed the heavens?\n\np. 151\n\n19 He who hath eyes on all sides round about him, a mouth on  \nall sides, arms and feet on all sides,  \nHe the sole God, producing earth and heaven, weldeth them  \nwith his arms as wings together.  \n20 What was the tree, what wood in sooth produced it, from  \nwhich they fashioned out the earth and heaven?  \nYe thoughtful men, inquire within your spirit whereon he  \nstood when he established all things.  \n21 Thine highest, lowest sacrificial natures, and these thy  \nmidmost here, O Visvakarman,  \nTeach thou thy friends at sacrifice, O Blessed, and come thy-  \nself, exalted, to our worship.  \n22 Bring those, thyself exalted with oblation, O Visvakarman,  \nEarth and Heaven to worship.  \nLet enemies around us live in folly: here let us have a rich  \nand liberal patron.  \n23, 24. = VIII. 45, 46.  \n25 The Father of the eye, the Wise in spirit, created both these  \nworlds submerged in fatness.  \nThen when the eastern ends were firmly fastened, the heavens  \nand the earth were far extended.  \n26 Mighty in mind and power is Visvakarman, Maker, Disposer,  \nand most lofty Presence.\n\np. 152\n\nTheir offerings joy in rich juice where they value One, only  \nOne beyond the Seven Rishis.  \n27 Father who made us, he who, as Disposer, knoweth all races  \nand all things existing,  \nEven he alone, the Deities\xc2\x92 name-giver,\xc2\x97him other beings  \nseek for information.  \n28 To him in sacrifice they offered treasures,\xc2\x97Rishis of old, in  \nnumerous troops, as singers,  \nWho, in the distant, near, and lower region, made ready all  \nthese things that have existence.  \n29 That which is earlier than this earth and heaven, before the  \nAsuras and Gods had being,  \nWhat was the germ primeval which the waters received where  \nthe first Gods beheld each other?  \n30 The waters, they received that germ primeval wherein the  \nGods were gathered all together.  \nIt rested set upon the Unborn's navel, that One wherein abide  \nall things existing.  \n31 Ye will not find him who produced these creatures: another  \nthing hath risen up among you.  \nEnwrapt in misty cloud, with lips that stammer, hymn-chanters  \nwander and are discontented.  \n32 First was the God engendered, Visvakarman: then the  \nGandharva sprang to life as second.  \nThird in succession was the plants\xc2\x92 begetter: he laid the  \nwaters\xc2\x92 germ in many places.  \n33 Swift, rapidly striking, like a bull who sharpens his horns,  \nterrific, stirring up the people,  \nWith eyes that close not, bellowing, Sole Hero, Indra subdued  \nat once a hundred armies.\n\np. 153\n\n34 With him loud-roaring, ever watchful, Victor, bold, hard to  \noverthrow, Rouser of battle,  \nIndra the Strong, whose hand bears arrows, conquer, ye  \nwarriors, now, now vanquish in the combat.  \n35 He rules with those who carry shafts and quivers, Indra who  \nwith his band brings hosts together,  \nFoe-conquering, strong of arm, the Soma-drinker, with mighty  \nbow, shooting with well-laid arrows.  \n36 Brihaspati, fly with thy chariot hither, slayer of demons,  \ndriving off our foemen.  \nBe thou protector of our cars, destroyer, victor in battle,  \nbreaker-up of armies.  \n37 Conspicuous by thy strength, firm, foremost fighter, mighty  \nand fierce, victorious, all-subduing,  \nThe Son of Conquest, passing men and heroes, kine-winner,  \nmount thy conquering car, O Indra.  \n38 Cleaver of stalls, kine-winner, armed with thunder, who quells  \nan army and with might destroys it,  \nFollow him, brothers! quit yourselves like heroes, and like  \nthis Indra show your zeal and courage.  \n39 Piercing the cow-stalls with surpassing vigour, Indra, the  \npitiless Hero, wild with anger,  \nVictor in fight, unshaken and resistless,\xc2\x97may he protect our  \narmies in our battles.  \n40 Indra guide these: Brihaspati precede them, the guerdon,  \nand the sacrifice, and Soma;  \nAnd let the banded Maruts march in forefront of heavenly  \nhosts that conquer and demolish.  \n41 Ours be the potent host of mighty Indra, King Varuna, and  \nMaruts, and \xc3\x82dityas.  \nUplifted is the shout of Gods who conquer, high-minded Gods  \nwho cause the worlds to tremble.  \n42 Bristle thou up, O Bounteous Lord, our weapons: excite the  \nspirits of my warring heroes.  \nUrge on the strong steeds\xc2\x92 might, O Vritra-slayer, and let the  \ndin of conquering cars go upward.  \n43 May Indra aid us when our flags are gathered: victorious be  \nthe arrows of our army.  \nMay our brave men of war prevail in battle. Ye Gods protect  \nus in the shout of onset.\n\np. 154\n\n44 Bewildering the senses of our foemen, seize thou their bodies  \nand depart, O Apva.  \nAttack them, set their hearts on fire and burn them: so let  \nour foes abide in utter darkness.  \n45 Loosed from the bowstring fly awry, O Arrow, sharpened by  \nour prayer.  \nGo to the foemen, strike them home, and let not one of  \nthem escape.  \n46 Advance, O heroes, win the day. May Indra be your sure  \ndefence.  \nExceeding mighty be your arms, that none may wound or  \ninjure you.  \n47 That army of our enemies, O Maruts, that comes against  \nus with its might, [contending](errata.htm#7),  \nMeet ye and wrap it in unwelcome darkness so that not one  \nof them may know another.  \n48 There where the flights of arrows fall like boys whose locks  \nare yet unshorn,  \nMay Indra, may Brihaspati, may Aditi protect us well, protect  \nus well through all our days.  \n49 Thy vital parts I cover with thine armour: with immortality  \nKing Soma clothe thee.  \nVaruna give thee what is more than ample, and in thy  \ntriumph may the Gods be joyful.  \n50 Worshipped with butter, Agni, lead this man to high  \npreeminence.  \nVouchsafe him growth of riches and multiply him with  \n[progeny](errata.htm#8).\n\np. 155\n\n51 Indra, lead him to eminence: controller of his foes be he.  \nVouchsafe him lustre: let him give their sacred portions to  \nthe Gods.  \n52 The man within whose house we pay oblation, Indra, prosper  \nhim.  \nMay the Gods bless and comfort him, they and this  \nBrahmanaspati.  \n53 May the All-Gods, O Agni, bear and lift thee upward with  \ntheir thoughts.  \nFair to be looked on, rich in light, he thou propitious unto  \nus.  \n54 May the Five Regions guard, divine, our worship, Goddesses  \nchasing lack of thought and hatred,  \nGiving the Sacrificer growth of riches. Let sacrifice be based  \non growth of riches.  \n55 Inspirited above enkindled Agni, adorable, winged with  \nhymns, was it accepted,  \nWhen the Gods offered sacrifice with viands, circling the  \nheated caldron, paving worship.  \n56 Lord of a hundred draughts. benign, God-serving\xc2\x97to him  \ndivine, establisher, protector,  \nThe Gods approached the sacrifice, encircling. Gods for the  \nGods stood fain for sacred service.  \n57 When the fourth sacrifice reaches the oblation, accepted offering  \nwhich hath been made ready, fit for the Inmolator's  \nsacrificing,  \nThence bless us prayers and holy recitations!  \n58 Savitar, golden-hued, hath lifted eastward, bright with the  \nsunbeams, his eternal lustre,  \nHe at whose furtherance wise Pushan marches surveying all  \nexistence like a herdsman.\n\np. 156\n\n59 He sits, the measurer, in the midst of heaven, filling the two  \nworld-halves and air's mid-region.  \nHe looks upon the rich far-spreading pastures between the  \neastern and the western limit.  \n60 Steer, Sea, Red Bird with strong wings, he hath entered the  \ndwelling-place of the Primeval Father.  \nA gay-hued Stone set in the midst of heaven, he hath gone  \nforth and guards the air's two limits.  \n61 All sacred songs have glorified Indra expansive as the sea,  \nThe best of warriors borne on cars, the Lord, the Very Lord  \nof strength.  \n62 May God-invoking sacrifice bring the Gods hitherward to us.  \nMay bless-invoking sacrifice bring the Gods hitherward to us.  \nMay Agni, God, make offering and hither bring the Gods to  \nus.  \n63 May the abundant growth of wealth with elevation lift me  \nup,  \nAnd with his subjugating power may Indra keep my foemen  \ndown.  \n64 Upraising and depression and devotion may the Gods increase.  \nMay Indra, too, and Agni drive my foes away to every side.  \n65 Go ye by Agni to the sky bearing the Ukhya in your hands.  \nReaching the heights of sky and heaven stay intermingled  \nwith the Gods.  \n66 Agni, go forward to the eastern region, well-skilled, be here  \nthe fire in front of Agni.  \nIlluming all the quarters, shine with splendour: supply with  \nfood our quadrupeds and bipeds.\n\np. 157\n\n67 From earth to air's mid-region have I mounted, and from  \nmid-air ascended up to heaven.  \nFrom the high pitch of heaven's cope I came into the world  \nof light.  \n68 Mounting the sky they look not round: they rise to heaven  \nthrough both the worlds\xc2\x97  \nSages who span the sacrifice that pours its stream on every side.  \n69 Foremost of those who seek the Gods come forward, thou  \nwho art eye of Gods and men, O Agni.  \nAccordant with the Bhrigus, fain to worship, to heaven in  \nsafety go the Sacrificers.  \n70 Night and Dawn, different in hue, accordant, etc., as in XII. 2.  \n71 O Agni, thousand-eyed and hundred-headed, thy breaths are  \nhundred, thy through-breaths a thousand.  \nThou art the Lord of thousandfold possessions. To thee;  \nfor strength, may we present oblation.  \n72 Thou art the Bird of goodly wing: be seated on the ridge  \nof earth.  \nFill air's mid-region with thy glow, supporting with thy  \nlight the sky, confirm the quarters with thy sheen.  \n73 Receiving offerings, fair of aspect, eastward be duly seated  \nin thy place, O Agni.  \nIn this the more exalted habitation be seated All-Gods and  \nthe Sacrificer.  \n74 That wondrous all-mankind-embracing favour of Savitar,  \nchoice-worthy, I solicit,  \nEven his which Kanva wont to milk, the mighty, the teeming  \nCow who yields a thousand milk-streams.\n\np. 158\n\n75 May we adore thee in thy loftiest birth place, Agni! with  \npraise-songs in thy lower station.  \nThe place whence those hast issued forth I worship. In thee,  \nwell kindled, have they paid oblations  \n76 Shine thou before us, Agni, well enkindled, with flame, most  \nyouthful God, that never fadeth.  \nUnceasing unto thee come sacred viands.  \n77 Agni, this day with lands, etc., as in XV. 44.  \n78 I dedicate the thought with mind and butter so that the  \nGods may come who love oblation, strengthing Law,  \nTo Visvakarman, Lord of all the earth, I offer up day after  \nday the inviolable sacrifice.  \n79 Seven fuel logs hast thou, seven tongues, O Agni, seven Rishis  \nhast thou, seven beloved mansions.  \nSeven-priests in sevenfold manner pay thee worship. Fill  \nfull\xc2\x97All-hail to thee!\xc2\x97seven wombs with butter.  \n80 Purely-Bright, Wonderfully-Bright, Really-Bright,  \nAll-Luminous,  \nBright, Law's-Protector, Safe-from-Ill;  \n81 Such, Other-Looking, Equal, Similar, Measured, Commensurate,  \nJointly-Bearing-up.  \n82 Right, Real, Firm, Strong-to-Support, Bearer, Disposer,  \nManager.  \n83 Winner-of-Right, Winner-of-Truth, Host-Conquering,  \nLord-of-Goodly-Host,  \nWhose-Friends-are-Near-at-Hand, Whose-Banded-Enemies-are-Far-Away:\n\np. 159\n\n84 To day in this our sacrifice be present, Such, Looking-Thus,  \nSame, Similar-in-appearance,  \nMeasured, Commensurate, Joint-Bearers, Maruts!  \n85 Self-Powerful, Voracious-One, Kin-to-the-Sun, The  \nHouse-holder,  \nPlay-Lover, Mighty, Conqueror.  \nFierce, Terrible, The Resonant, The Roaring. Victorious,  \nAssailant, and Dispeller, All-Hail!  \n86 The Maruts, clans divine, became the followers of Indra; as  \nThe Maruts, clans divine, became the followers of Indra, so  \nMay clans divine and human he the Sacrificer's followers.  \n87 Drink in the middle of the flood, O Agni, this breast stored  \nfull of sap, teeming with water.  \nWelcome this fountain redolent of sweetness. O Courser,  \nenter those thy watery dwelling.  \n88 Oil hath been mixed: oil is his habitation. In oil he rests:  \noil is his proper province.  \nCome as thy wont is. O thou Steer, rejoice thee. Bear off  \nthe oblation duly consecrated.  \n89 Forth from the ocean sprang the wave of sweetness: together  \nwith the stalk it turned to Amrit,  \nThat which is holy oil's mysterious title: but the Gods\xc2\x92  \ntongue is truly Amities centre.  \n90 Let us Declare aloud the name of Ghrita, and at this sacrifice  \nheld it up with homage.  \nSo let the Brahman hear the praise we utter. This hath the  \nfour-horned Buffalo emitted.\n\np. 160\n\n91 Four are his horns, three are the feet that bear him: his  \nheads are two, his hands are seven in number.  \nBound with a triple bond the Bull roars loudly: the mighty  \nGod hath entered into mortals.  \n92 That oil in triple shape the Gods discovered laid down with-  \nin the Cow, concealed by Panis.  \nIndra produced one shape, Surya another: by their own  \npower they formed the third from Vena.  \n93 From inmost reservoir in countless channels flow down these  \nrivers which the foe beholds not.  \nI look upon the streams of oil descending, and lo! the  \nGolden Reed is there among them.  \n94 Like rivers our libations flow together, cleansing themselves  \nin inmost heart and spirit.  \nThe streams of holy oil pour swiftly downward like the wild  \nbeasts that fly before the bowman.  \n95 As rushing down the rapids of a river, flow swifter than the  \nwind the vigorous currents,  \nThe streams of oil in swelling fluctuation like a red courser  \nbursting through the fences.\n\np. 161\n\n96 Like women at a gathering fair to look on and gently smiling,  \nthey incline to Agni.  \nThe streams of holy oil attain the fuel, and Jatavedas joyfully  \nreceives them.  \n97 As maidens deck themselves with gay adornment to join the  \nbridal feast, I now behold them.  \nWhere Soma flows and sacrifice is ready, thither the streams  \nof holy oil are running.  \n98 Send to our eulogy a herd of cattle: bestow upon us excellent  \npossessions.  \nBear to the Gods the sacrifice we offers the streams of oil flow  \npure and full of sweetness.  \n99 The universe depends upon thy power and might within the  \nsea, within the heart, within all life.  \nMay we attain that sweetly-flavoured wave of thine, brought,  \nat this gathering, o\xc2\x92er the surface of the floods.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book XVIII](wyvbk18.htm)\n\n"
