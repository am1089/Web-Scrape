Upon this one said Shivu; another, Vishnu; and a third,\nBruhmu; but they did not all agree in pointing out one of the three as the\ngreatest. Then several great saints and sages said, "We will not be satisfied\nwith any opinions thus expressed; but if any one will go and make trial of\nthese three deities, and pronounce one of them to be virtue, religion and\njustice personified, we will believe what he says to be true." They all\nassented to this proposal, and directed Bhrigoo, the son of Bruhmu, to make\ntrial of the three deities and return. When Bhrigoo, the sage, had obtained\nthe order, he went first to the world of Bruhmu, and sat in silence in\nBruhmu\'s court; he did not make any salutation, nor did he offer praises, nor\ngo round to the right hand by way of adoration. When Bruhmu, O Raja! saw the\nimpropriety of his son\'s conduct, he was very angry, and on the point of\ncursing him; but abstained through a feeling of natural affection for his son.\nThen Bhrigoo, having seen Bruhmu powerless through the\n\np. 433\n\nproperty of passion, rose up thence, and went to Kuelas, and remained standing\nat the abode of Shivu and Parbutee. Shivu Jee rose on seeing him, and when he\nextended his arms to embrace him, Bhrigoo sat down; at which Shivu Jee was\ngreatly enraged, and took up his trident to kill him. Shree Parbutee then\ninterceded very earnestly for him; and having fallen at the feet of Muhadeo\nJee explained to him, and said, This is your younger brother, be pleased to\nforgive his fault." It is said, \'If a child commits a fault, a holy man will\nnot think any thing of it.\'"\n\nO great king! when Parbutee Jee had cooled the anger of Shivu by her\nexplanations, Bhrigoo, having seen Muhadeo Jee, absorbed in the property of\ndarkness, rose up and went away. He then went to Indru\'s heaven, where Bhugwan\nwas sleeping with Luchmee on a bed of flowers, spread on a bedstead of gold,\nwith curtains and covered with jewels. On going there Bhrigoo gave Bhugwan\nsuch a kick in the breast that he started up from sleep, when Huri saw the\nsage, he left Luchmee, and came down from his couch; and fixing his eyes upon\nthe head and feet of Bhrigoo Jee began to rub them, and thus address him, "O\nchief of the sages! be pleased to forgive my fault, I have unintentionally\nhurt your soft lotus-like feet with my hard breast, be pleased not to think of\nthis offence of mine." When Vishnu (the lord) had thus spoken, Bhrigoo Jee was\nhighly delighted, and having glorified Bhugwan took leave and came thence to\nthe banks of the Suruswutee, where all the saints and sages were sitting. On\nhis arrival Bhrigoo Jee related every circumstance exactly as it had occurred,\nin his visits to the three deities:--"Bruhmu clings to the property of\npassion; Muhadeo is impregnated with the property of darkness; Vishnu is chief\namongst the virtuous; no other god is greater than he." The doubts of the\nsages disappeared on hearing this; and joy was in the minds of all. All\napplauded Vishnu and established in their breasts a faith in him not to be\nshaken.\n\np. 434\n\nHaving proceeded thus far in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the\nRaja Pureechit,--O great king! I will relate an intermediate story, listen\nwith attention: Raja Oogursen ruled justly and virtuously in the city of\nDwarka, and Shree Krishnu Chund and Bulram were obedient to his orders; under\nthe government of the Raja all were attentive to their own duty, and carried\non business with intelligence, and lived happily and agreeably; a brahmin\ndwelt there also, who was a very well disposed and virtuous man; it so\nhappened that one of his sons died, and he took his dead son and went to the\ngate of Raja Oogursen, and began to say whatever came uppermost: "Your\nsubjects are oppressed by the acts of your government, and my son has also\ndied through your sin."\n\nHaving, O great king! made many speeches of this kind, and left the corpse of\nhis son at the Raja\'s gate, the brahmin came home; he afterwards had eight\nsons, and in like manner left all the eight at the Raja\'s gate; when the ninth\nwas about to be born, the brahmin went again to the court of Raja Oogursen,\nand standing up in the presence of Shree Krishnu Chund Jee, calling to mind\nhis grief for the death of his sons, and shedding tears began to say, "There\nis a curse on the Raja and on his government, and accursed are they who\nminister to this unjust tyrant; and there is a curse upon me for living in\nthis city had I not dwelt in the country of these sinners my sons would have\nescaped, through their want of religion and virtue my sons have died, and no\none has protected them."\n\nHe, O great king! uttered many expressions of this kind, standing up in the\ncourt and weeping; but no one made any reply; at length Urjoon, sitting near\nShree Krishnu Chund, and hearing what was said was perplexed in his mind, and\nsaid, "O deity! in whose presence have you thus spoken, and why are you thus\nafflicted? There is no archer in this court, who can drive away your grief;\n\np. 435\n\nmodern Rajas are selfish, and not men, who prevent the afflictions of others,\nand confer happiness on their subjects, and protect the cow and brahmin."\nUrjoon proceeded to say to the brahmin, "O divinity! go now, and remain in\nyour house, free from all care; when your child shall be about to be born come\nto me, and I will go with you, and will not allow the child to die." On\nhearing these words, the brahmin was angry and said, "I do not see any\npowerful man in this court, with exception of Shree Krishnu, Bulram,\nPurdiyomun and Unroodru, who could rescue my son from the hand of death."\nUrjoon replied, "Brahmin! thou dost not know me, that my name is Dhununjye, I\nmake a compact with thee, that if I do not rescue thy son from the hand of\ndeath, I will bring from whatever quarter I may find them thy deceased sons,\nand show them to thee; and if I do not obtain them, I will burn myself in fire\ntogether with the cow (bow?--JBH) Gandeeb."\n\nWhen, O great king! Urjoon having made this compact, had thus spoken, the\nbrahmin was satisfied, and went to his home; afterwards when the child was\nabout to be born, the brahmin came to Urjoon, who rose up and went with him,\ntaking his bow and arrows and having gone to the brahmin\'s house, so thatched\nit with arrows, that even air could not have access between the arrows, and he\nbegan to walk round the house himself in every direction, with his bow and\narrows in his hand.\n\nHaving proceeded thus far in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the\nRaja Pureechit,--O great king! Urjoon formed many plans for saving the child,\nbut it was not saved. On another day he was weeping at the time of the child\'s\nexpected birth; on that day the child did not even breathe, but came forth\ndead from the womb. Urjoon having heard of the child having come forth dead\nwas ashamed, and went to Shree Krishnu Chund, and the brahmin went after him;\nthe brahmin came crying, and began to say, "Urjoon! a\n\np. 436\n\ncurse is upon thee, and thy life for showing thy face in the world, after\nhaving spoken falsely; O eunuch! if you could not save my child from death,\nwhy did you make an agreement to do so, and to bring and show nee my other\ndeceased sons, if you could not save this one?"\n\nOn hearing these words, O great king! Urjoon rose up, and taking his bow and\narrows, went thence, to the capital of Jinn to Dhurumraj, who stood up on\nseeing him, and joining his hands, and eulogizing Urjoon, said,--"O great\nking! for what reason have you come here?" Urjoon replied, "I have come to\ntake away with me the sons of a certain brahmin." Dhurumraj said "Those\nchildren are not here." When Dhurumraj had thus spoken, Urjoon departed\nthence, and wandered over all places, but did not find the brahmin\'s children.\nA t length, he came to the city of Dwarka in a state of grief and regret; and,\nhaving erected a funeral pile, prepared to be burnt upon it with his bow and\n[arrows](errata.htm#29) having then lighted the pile, when Urjoon was about to\nsit down upon it, Shree Moorari, the destroyer of pride, came, and laid hold\nof his hand, and said laughing, "Urjoon! do not burn thyself, I will fulfil\nthy compact, and will bring that brahmin\'s sons from whatever place they may\nbe in." The lord of the three worlds having thus spoken and ascended his\nchariot, went to the eastward, taking Urjoon with him; and, having crossed the\nseven seas, arrived at the mountainous belt, bounding the world. Having on\narrival there descended from the chariot, they entered a very dark cave. Then\nShree Krishnu Chund Jee gave an order to the quoit Soodursun, who, having\ncreated a light, equal to the splendour of hundred million of suns, went in\nadvance of Krishnu and dispelled the great darkness from before him. Having\nleft the darkness they proceeded a short distance, and then they went into\nwater; there were great waves into which they entered, shutting their eyes,\nKrishnu and Urjoon swam to the abode of the king of the serpent race, who\nupholds the world.\n\np. 437\n\n[paragraph continues] Having opened their eyes on going there, they beheld a\nlarge, long, broad, lofty, very elegant golden house, covered with jewels; and\nthere, upon the head of the king of the serpent face was an ornamented throne,\nupon which, in the form of a black cloud, of an elegant shape, with a moon-\nlike body, eyes like the lotus, wearing a diadem and ear-rings, dressed in\nyellow, with a yellow silken cloth bound on him, having on a garland of\nflowers reaching to his feet, and a pearl of necklace, the lord himself of a\nfascinating appearance dwelt; and Bruhmu, Roodru, Indru and all the gods\nstanding up in his presence, were glorifying him.\n\nO great king! having beheld this handsome figure, Urjoon and Shree Krishnu\nChund Jee went into the presence of the lord; and, having performed obeisance,\nand joined their hands, mentioned all the reasons of their journey. On hearing\ntheir speech the lord had all the brahmin\'s children brought there, and given\nto them; and Urjoon was delighted at seeing and receiving them. Then the lord\nsaid, "You are both portions of my body, behold Huri and Urjoon to whom my\nheart desires; you went upon the earth to remove its burthens, and have\nconferred great happiness on holy and virtuous men; you have destroyed all the\ndemons and evil spirits, and adjusted the affairs of gods, men and sages; you\nboth are parts of me; your business has been accomplished." Having thus\nspoken, Bhugwan allowed Urjoon and Shree Krishnu Jee to take leave, who came\nto the city, bringing the children with them; and the brahmin received his\nchildren; there were rejoicings and festivities in every house.\n\nHaving recited thus much, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to Raja Pureechit,--O great\nking! whoever shall hear this story, and reflect upon it, his sons shall be\nprosperous.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XC](psa91.htm)\n\n'
