Why can\'t father write like that,\nI wonder?\n\nDid he never hear from his own mother stories of giants and fairies and\nprincesses?\n\nHas he forgotten them all?\n\nOften when he gets late for his bath you have to go and call him an hundred\ntimes.\n\nYou wait and keep his dishes warm for him, but he goes on writing and forgets.\n\nFather always plays at making books.\n\nIf ever I go to play in father\'s room, you come and call me, "what a naughty\nchild!"\n\nIf I make the slightest noise, you say, "Don\'t you see that father\'s at his\nwork?"\n\nWhat\'s the fun of always writing and writing?\n\nWhen I take up father\'s pen or pencil and write upon his book just as he does,\n--a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i,--why do you get cross with me, then, mother?\n\nYou never say a word when father writes.\n\nWhen my father wastes such heaps of paper, mother, you don\'t seem to mind at\nall.\n\nBut if I take only one sheet to make a boat with, you say, "Child, how\ntroublesome you are!"\n\nWhat do you think of father\'s spoiling sheets and sheets of paper with black\nmarks all over on both sides?\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Wicked Postman](cm32.htm)\n\n'
