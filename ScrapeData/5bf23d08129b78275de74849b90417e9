If you want your own good,\nexamine and consider them well.  \nYou have estranged yourself from the Creator, of whom you have sprung: you\nhave lost your reason, you have bought death.  \nAll doctrines and all teachings are sprung from Him, from Him they grow: know\nthis for certain, and have no fear.  \nHear from me the tidings of this great truth!  \nWhose name do you sing, and on whom do you meditate? O, come forth from this\nentanglement!  \nHe dwells at the heart of all things, so why take refuge in empty desolation?\np. 124  \nIf you place the Guru at a distance from you, then it is but the distance that\nyou honour:  \nIf indeed the Master be far away, then who is it else that is creating this\nworld?  \nWhen you think that He is not here, then you wander further and further away,\nand seek Him in vain with tears.  \nWhere He is far off, there He is unattainable: where He is near, He is very\nbliss.  \nKabir says: "Lest His servant should suffer pain He pervades him through and\nthrough."  \nKnow yourself then, O Kabir; for He is in you from head to foot.  \nSing with gladness, and keep your seat unmoved within your heart.\n\np. 125\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: LXXIX](sok080.htm)\n\n'
