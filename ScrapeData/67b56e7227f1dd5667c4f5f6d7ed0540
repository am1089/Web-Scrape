And although (they both be) meditations on man; on account of others not\nbeing recorded.\n\nIn the Taittiriyaka as well as the _Kh_ andogya we meet with a meditation on\nman (purusha-vidya), in which parts of the sacrifice are fancifully identified\nwith the parts of\n\np. 644\n\nthe human body.--Here the Purvapakshin maintains that these two meditations\nare identical; for, he says, both meditations have the same name (purusha-\nvidya), and the same character as stated above; and as the Taittiriyaka\nmentions no fruit of the meditation, the fruit declared in the _Kh_ andogya\nholds good for the Taittiriyaka also, and thus there is no difference of\nfruit.--This view the Sutra negatives. Although both meditations are\nmeditations on man, yet they are separate 'on account of the others not being\nrecorded,' i.e. on account of the qualities recorded in one _s_ akha not being\nrecorded in the other. For the Taittiriyaka mentions the three libations,\nwhile the _Kh_ andogya does not, and so on. The character of the two\nmeditations thus differs. And there is a difference of result also. For an\nexamination of the context in the Taittiriyaka shows that the purusha-vidya is\nmerely a subordinate part of a meditation on Brahman, the fruit of which the\ntext declares to be that the devotee reaches the greatness of Brahman; while\nthe _Kh_ andogya meditation is an independent one, and has for its reward the\nattainment of long life. The two meditations are thus separate, and hence the\ndetails of one must not be included in the other.--Here terminates the\nadhikara _n_ a of 'the meditation on man.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 25.
