Its population comprises about two hundred and ninety-five\nmillions, and is of greatest density on the fertile northern plain, which is\nwatered by three river systems, the Indus and its tributaries on the west, and\nthe Ganges and Brahmaputra with their tributaries which pour into the Bay of\nBengal. South of the Vindhya mountain ranges is the plateau of the Deccan. The\nclimate varies from temperate on the Himalayan slopes to tropical in southern\nIndia, and over the entire country there are two pronounced annual seasons,\nthe dry and the rainy.\n\nOur interest abides in this volume chiefly with the northern plain and the\npeople who are familiar in varying degrees with the sacred and heroic\nliterature passed under review; that is, with the scenes of the early Indian\ncivilization known as Aryan and those numerous inheritors of Aryan traditions,\nthe Hindus, who exceed two hundred and seven millions of the population of\nIndia. Modern Hinduism embraces a number of cults which are connected with the\nearly religious doctrines of the Aryanized or Brahmanized India of the past;\nit recognizes, among other things, the ancient caste system which includes\ndistinct racial types varying from what is known as the\n\np. xviii\n\nAryan to the pre-Dravidian stocks. Other religious organizations may be\nreferred to in passing. Buddhists are chiefly confined to Burma, Sikhs number\ntwo millions, the Mohammedans nearly sixty-three millions, while the Parsecs\nnumber roughly ninety-five thousand; less than three million natives and half-\ncastes are Christians.\n\nLike Egypt, India is a land of ancient memories, but its history, or rather\npre-history, does not begin until about a thousand years after the erection\nwas completed of the great pyramids at Gizeh. Between 2000 B.C. and 1200 B.C.\ntribes of pastoral and patriarchal peoples of Aryan speech were pouring over\nthe north-western frontier and settling in the Punjab. There are no written or\ninscribed records, or even native traditions, of this historic migration, but\nwe are able to follow vaguely, from the references found in religious\ncompositions, the gradual conquest of northern India, which covered a period\nof several centuries. To what extent this invasion was racial, rather than\ncultural, it is extremely difficult to discover. But no doubt can be\nentertained regarding the influence exercised by the ancient military\naristocracy and their religious teachers. Certain of the Aryan gods still\nreceive recognition in India after a lapse of over three thousand years. This\nfact makes Indian mythology of special interest to the ever-increasing number\nof students of comparative religion.\n\nIndian mythology also possesses particular attractions for us on account of\nits intimate association with what is known as the "Aryan problem". Scholars\nof a past generation held pronounced views on Aryan matters, and produced a\nconsiderable literature of highly controversial character. In fact, theories\nregarding the Aryan languages and the Aryan "race" are as varied as they are\nnumerous; the wordy warfare which occupied the greater\n\np. xix\n\nand not infrequently with much brilliance; occasionally, however, it was not\nawanting in the undesirable elements of personal feeling and national\nantipathy. But, happily, we appear to have reached a time when this\nfascinating and important problem can be considered dispassionately in the\nproper scientific spirit, and without experiencing that unnecessary dread of\nhaving to abandon decided opinions which may have been formed when the\naccumulated data had less variety and bulk than that which is now available.\nThis change has been brought about by the extended study of comparative\nreligion and the wonderful and engaging results which have attended modern-day\nmethods of ethnic and archaeological research.\n\nThe Aryan controversy had its origin at the close of the eighteenth century,\nwhen that distinguished Oriental scholar Sir William Jones, who acted for a\nperiod as a judge of the Supreme Court in Bengal, drew attention to the\nremarkable resemblances between the Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, German, and Celtic\nlanguages. In 1808, Schlegel published his _Language and Wisdom of the Hindus_\n, and urged the theory that India was the home of an ancestral race and a\ngroup of languages that were progenitors of various European ones. Other\nscholars subsequently favoured Zend, the language of Persia, and transferred\nthe "racial beehive" to that country; rival claims were afterwards set up for\nAsia Minor and the Iranian plateau.\n\nThe science of Comparative Philology was a direct product of these early\ncontroversies; it was established in the "thirties" when Bopp published his\nComparative Grammar in which a new term, having a racial significance, was\ninvented: he grouped all European languages, except Basque, Magyar, Turkish,\nand Finnish, as "Indo-Germanic". After the study of Sanskrit literature\nrevealed, however,\n\np. xx\n\nthat the Aryans occupied but a small part of India when their sacred hymns,\nthe Vedas, were composed, the cradle of the Aryan race was shifted to some\nuncertain area beyond the Himalayan mountains.\n\nMax Muller, the distinguished Sanskrit authority, who in the words of an\nIndian scholar "devoted his life-time to the elucidation of the learning,\nliterature, and religion of ancient India", 1 abandoned Bopp\'s patriotic term\n"Indo-Germanic" and adopted Aryan, which he founded on the Sanskrit racial\ndesignation "Arya". At first he accepted the theory of an Aryan race and\nespecially of an Aryan civilization which originated on the Central Asian\nplateau, but, as will be seen, he subsequently modified his views in this\nregard.\n\nA new theory regarding the Aryans, who are now more commonly referred to as\nIndo-Europeans, was strongly advocated in 1851 and later by Dr. Robert Gordon\nLatham, who devoted many years to the study of ethnology and philology. He\nargued that as the major part of the peoples speaking Indo-European tongues\nwas found in Europe, the cradle of the race might, after all, be transferred\nwestward. This theory was supported by the fact (among others) that the\nLithuanian language was no less archaic than Sanskrit.\n\nThe European hypothesis found in time many able supporters, and the advocates\nof rival Teutonic and Celtic claims waxed eloquent and heated over the exact\nlocation of the Aryan homeland. An industrious search was mean-while conducted\nfor words common to all Aryan languages which described the natural features\nof the racial "cradle". This work of reconstruction was certainly not lacking\nin picturesque results, for attractive visions were presented of Aryan\nArcadias in which the simple and contemplative\n\np. xxi\n\nancestors of many bitter controversialists dwelt together in exemplary unity\nand peace. The question of location might remain unsettled, but it was\ngenerally agreed that the ancient people were surrounded by cows, sheep, and\ngoats; sometimes they rode their horses or yoked them in rough rumbling carts,\nand sometimes they ate them. No asses were admitted to the fold because of\ntheir decided partiality for Central Asian plains, which seemed quite\nreasonable. Trouble was occasionally caused by wolves and bears, or, mayhap, a\nstray lion, but these and other worries associated with the simple life might\nbe compensated for by the fact that the primitive people, as one writer 1 put\nit, "understood the art of drinking". Mead, brewed from honey, was found to be\n"dear to the hearts of the ancient Aryans"; had the Brahman ever forgotten his\n"madhu", the Welsh-man his "medhu", or the Lithuanian his "medus"? Problems\narose regarding the ancients\' knowledge of trees: it was found that "bhaga"\nwas applied indifferently by the family groups to the beech and the oak, and\nmore than one ingenious explanation was suggested to account for this apparent\ndiscrepancy. Then, suddenly, Professor Max Muller swept into the background\nthe rival Aryan homeland pictures, pointing out the while that it is "almost\nimpossible to discover any animal or any plant that is peculiar to the north\nof Europe and is not found sporadically in Asia also". Destructive criticism\nproceeded apace, until now nothing has been left to us of the ancestral\nArcadia but "air, water, heat and cold". In his review of the widely accepted\nphilological "evidence" regarding the Aryan homeland, Max Muller declared it\nto be so pliant that it was possible "to make out a more or less plausible\ncase for any part of the world". The advanced group of philologists held,\nindeed, that no racial\n\np. xxii\n\ncentre could be located. Ultimately "Delbruck went so far," says Professor\nRipley, "as to deny that any single parent language ever existed in fact". 1\n\nMeanwhile ethnologists and archaeologists were engaged accumulating important\ndata. It was found that Europe had been invaded at the close of the Stone Age\nby a broad-headed (brachycephalic) people, who brought no culture and even\nretarded the growth of civilization in their areas of settlement. A new\nproblem was thus presented: were the Aryans a brachycephalic (broad-headed) or\na dolichocephalic (long-headed) people? Its solution was rendered all the more\ndifficult when it was found that living representatives of both racial types\nwere peoples of Aryan speech. The idea that skull shapes, which are associated\nwith other distinct physical characteristics, were due to habits of life and\nthe quality of food which had to be masticated, was in time advanced to\ndiscredit new methods of ethnic research, but it has since been thoroughly\ndisproved. In many ancient graves are found skulls which do not differ from\nthose of modern men and women, living under different conditions and eating\ndifferent food.\n\nPatriotic controversialists were not awanting again in dealing with the\nproblem of varying skull shapes. French scientists, for instance, have\nidentified the "broad heads", now generally known as the Alpine race, with the\nubiquitous Celts, but as present-day Hindus are mainly "long heads", the Aryan\nracial connection here suggested remains obscure. A clue to the mystery was\nsought for in Asia Minor, but no satisfactory result could be obtained there\nto support philological theories, because the Armenians, who are "broad\nheads", and their enemies and neighbours the Kurds, who are "long heads", are\n\np. xxiii\n\nboth peoples of Aryan speech. A scornful scientist has dismissed as a\n"prehistoric romance", the theory that the fair Scandinavian "long heads" are\nidentical with the brunet "long heads" of India. Both the Celtic (Alpine) and\nIndo-Germanic racial theories are as inconclusive as they are diametrically in\nopposition.\n\nThe science of philology, which, at its inception, "dazzled and silenced all",\nhas been proved to be no safe guide in racial matters. We must avoid, as\nProfessor Ripley says, "the error of confusing community of language with\nidentity of race. Nationality may often follow linguistic boundaries, but race\nbears no necessary relation whatever to them." 1\n\nBy way of illustration, it may be pointed out in this connection that English\nis spoken at the present day by, among others, the Hong Kong Chinamen, the\nAmerican Red Indians and negroes, by the natives of Ireland, Wales, Cornwall,\nand the Scottish Highlands, besides the descendants of the ancient Britons,\nthe Jutes, the Angles, the Saxons, the Norsemen, the Danes, and the Normans in\nEngland, but all these peoples cannot be classified in the racial sense simply\nas Englishmen. Similarly, the varied types of humanity who are Aryan in speech\ncannot all be regarded as representatives of the "Aryan race", that is, if we\naccept the theory of an "Aryan race", which Virchow, by the way, has\ncharacterized as "a pure fiction".\n\nMax Muller, in his closing years, faced this aspect of the problem frankly and\ncourageously. "Aryas", he wrote, "are those who speak Aryan languages,\nwhatever their colour, whatever their blood. In calling them Aryas we\npredicate nothing of them except that the grammar of their language is Aryan.\n. . . I have declared again\n\np. xxiv\n\nand again that if I say Aryas, I mean neither blood, nor bones, nor hair, nor\nskull; I mean simply those who speak an Aryan language. The same applies to\nHindus, Greeks, Romans, Germans, Celts, and Slays. When I speak of these I\ncommit myself to no anatomical characteristics. The blue-eyed and fair-haired\nScandinavians may have been conquerors or conquered, they may have adopted the\nlanguage of their darker lords or their subjects, or vice versa. I assert\nnothing beyond their language when I call them Hindus, Greeks, Romans,\nGermans, Celts, and Slays, and in that sense, and in that sense only, do I say\nthat even the blackest Hindus represent an earlier stage of Aryan speech and\nthought than the fairest Scandinavians. . . . To me an ethnologist who speaks\nof an Aryan race, Aryan blood, Aryan eyes and hair, is as great a sinner as a\nlinguist who speaks of a dolichocephalic dictionary or a brachycephalic\ngrammar." 1\n\nAryan, however, has been found to be a convenient term, and even ethnologists\ndo not scorn its use, although it has been applied "in a confusing variety of\nsignification by different philologists". One application of it is to the\nlanguage group comprising Sanskrit, Persian, Afghan, &c. Some still prefer it\nto "Indo-European", which has found rivals in "Afro-European", among those who\nconnect the Aryan languages with North Africa, and "Afro-Eurasian", which may\nbe regarded as universal in its racial application, especially if we accept\nDarwin\'s theory that the Garden of Eden was located somewhere in Africa. 2 We\nmay think of the Aryans as we do of the British when that term is used to\ninclude the peoples embraced by the British Empire.\n\np. xxv\n\nIn India the Aryans were from late Vedic times divided into four castes--\nBrahmans (priests), Kshatriyas (kings and warriors), Vaisyas (traders, &c.),\nand Sudras (aborigines).\n\nCaste (Varna) signifies "colour", but it is not certain whether the reference\nis to be given a physical or mythological application. The first three castes\nwere Aryans, the fairest people; the fourth caste, that comprising the dark-\nskinned aborigines, was non-Aryan. "Arya", however, was not always used in the\nsense that we have been accustomed to apply "Aryo-Indian". In one of the\nsacred books of the ancient people it is stated: "The colour of the Brahmans\nwas white; that of the Kshatriyas red; that of the Vaisyas yellow; and that of\nthe Sudras black". 1 This colour reference connects "caste" with the doctrine\nof yugas, or ages of the universe ([Chapter VI](iml11.htm#ch06)).\n\nRisley, dealing with "the leading castes and tribes in Northern India, from\nthe Bay of Bengal to the frontiers of Afghanistan", concludes from the data\nobtained from census returns, that we are able "to distinguish two extreme\ntypes of feature and physique, which may be provisionally described as Aryan\nand Dravidian. A third type, which in some respects may be looked upon as\nintermediate between these two, while in other, and perhaps the most\nimportant, points it can hardly be deemed Indian at all, is found along the\nnorthern and eastern borders of Bengal. The most prominent characters are a\nrelatively short (brachycephalic) head, a broad face, a short, wide nose, very\nlow in the bridge, and in extreme cases almost bridgeless; high and projecting\ncheekbones and eyelids, peculiarly formed so as to give the impression that\nthe eyes are obliquely set in the head. . . .\n\np. xxvi\n\n[paragraph continues] This type . . . may be conveniently described as\nMongoloid. . . ." 1\n\nAccording to Risley, the Aryan type is dolichocephalic (long-headed), "with\nstraight, finely-cut (lepto-rhine) nose, a long, symmetrical narrow face, a\nwell-developed forehead, regular features, and a high facial angle". The\nstature is "fairly high", and the body is "well proportioned, and slender\nrather than massive". The complexion is "a very light transparent\nbrown--\'wheat coloured\' is the common vernacular description--noticeably\nfairer than the mass of the population".\n\nThe Dravidian head, the same authority states, "usually inclines to be\ndolichocephalic", but "all other characters present a marked contrast to the\nAryan. The nose is thick and broad, and the formula expressing its\nproportionate dimensions is higher than in any known race, except the Negro.\nThe facial angle is comparatively low; the lips are thick; the face wide and\nfleshy; the features coarse and irregular." The stature is lower than that of\nthe Aryan type: "the figure is squat and the limbs sturdy. The colour of the\nskin varies from very dark brown to a shade closely approaching black. . . .\nBetween these extreme types", adds Risley, "we find a large number of\nintermediate groups." 2\n\nOf late years ethnologists have inclined to regard the lower types represented\nby hill and jungle tribes, the Veddas of Ceylon, &c., as pre-Dravidians. The\nbrunet and long-headed Dravidians may have entered India long before the\nAryans: they resemble closely the Brahui of Baluchistan and the Man-tse of\nChina.\n\nIndia is thus mainly long-headed (dolichocephalic). We have already seen,\nhowever, that in northern and eastern Bengal there are traces of an infusion\nof Mongolian\n\np. xxvii\n\n[paragraph continues] "broad heads"; another brachycephalic element is\npronounced in western India, but it is not Mongolian; possibly we have here\nevidences of a settlement of Alpine stock. According to Risley, these western\nbroad heads are the descendants of invading Scythians, 1 but this theory is\nnot generally accepted.\n\nThe Eur-Asian Alpine race of broad heads are a mountain people distributed\nfrom Hindu Kush westward to Brittany. On the land bridge of Asia Minor they\nare represented by the Armenians. Their eastern prehistoric migrations is by\nsome ethnologists believed to be marked by the Ainus of Japan. They are mostly\na grey-eyed folk, with dark hair and abundant moustache and beard, as\ncontrasted with the Mongols, whose facial hair is scanty. There are short and\nlong varieties of Alpine stock, and its representatives are usually sturdy and\nmuscular. In Europe these broad-headed invaders overlaid a long-headed brunet\npopulation, as the early graves show, but in the process of time the broad\nheads have again retreated mainly to their immemorial upland habitat. At the\npresent day the Alpine race separates the long-headed fair northern race from\nwhat is known as the long-headed dark Mediterranean race of the south.\n\nA slighter and long-headed brunet type is found south of Hindu Kush. Ripley\nhas condensed a mass of evidence to show that it is akin to the Mediterranean\nrace. 2 He refers to it as the "eastern branch", which includes Afghans and\nHindus. "We are all familiar with the type," he says, "especially as it is\nemphasized by inbreeding and selection among the Brahmans. . . . There can be\nno doubt of their (the Eastern Mediterraneans) racial affinities with our\nBerbers, Greeks, Italians, and\n\np. xxviii\n\nSpaniards. They are all members of the same race, at once the widest in its\ngeographical extension, the most populous and the most primitive of our three\nEuropean types." 1\n\nProfessor Elliot Smith supports Professor Ripley in this connection, and\nincludes the Arabs with the southern Persians in the same group, but finding\nthe terms "Hamitic" and "Mediterranean" insufficient, prefers to call this\nwidespread family the "Brown race", to distinguish its representatives from\nthe fair Northerners, the "yellow" Mongolians, and the "black" negroes.\n\nNorth of the Alpine racial area are found the nomadic Mongolians, who are also\n"broad heads", but with distinguishing facial characteristics which vary in\nlocalities. As we have seen, the Mongoloid features are traceable in India.\nMany settlers have migrated from Tibet, but among the high-caste Indians the\nMongoloid eyes and high cheek bones occur in families, suggesting early\ncrossment.\n\nAnother distinctive race has yet to be accounted for--the tall, fair, blue-\neyed, long-headed Northerners, represented by the Scandinavians of the present\nday. Sergi and other ethnologists have classed this type as a variety of the\nMediterranean race, which had its area of localization on the edge of the snow\nbelt on lofty plateaus and in proximity to the Arctic circle. The theory that\nthe distinctive blondness and great stature of the Northerners were acquired\nin isolation and perpetuated by artificial selection is, however, more\nsuggestive than conclusive, unless we accept the theory that acquired\ncharacteristics can be inherited. How dark eyes became grey or blue, and dark\nhair red or sandy, is a problem yet to be solved.\n\nThe ancestors of this fair race are believed to have\n\np. xxix\n\nbeen originally distributed along the northern Eur-Asian plateaus; Keane\'s\nblonde long-headed Chudes 1 and the Wu-suns in Chinese Turkestan are classed\nas varieties of the ancient Northern stock. An interesting problem is\npresented in this connection by the fair types among the ancient Egyptians,\nthe modern-day Berbers, and the blondes of the Atlas mountains in Morocco.\nSergi is inclined to place the "cradle" of the Northerners on the edge of the\nSahara.\n\nThe broad-headed Turki and Ugrians are usually referred to as a blend of the\nAlpine stock and the proto-Northerners, with, in places, Mongolian admixture.\n\nAs most of the early peoples were nomadic, or periodically nomadic, there must\nhave been in localities a good deal of interracial and intertribal fusion,\nwith the result that intermediate varieties were produced. It follows that the\nintellectual life of the mingling peoples would be strongly influenced by\nadmixture as well as by contact with great civilizations.\n\nIt now remains for us to deal with the Aryan problem in India. Dr. Haddon\nconsiders that the invading Aryans were "perhaps associated with Turki tribes"\nwhen they settled in the Punjab. 2 Prior to this racial movement, the\nKassites, whose origin is obscure, assisted by bands of Aryans, overthrew the\nHammurabi dynasty in Babylon and established the Kassite dynasty between 2000\nB.C. and 1700 B.C. At this period the domesticated horse was introduced, and\nits Babylonian name, "the ass of the East", is an indication whence it came.\nAnother Aryan invasion farther west is marked by the establishment of the\nMitanni kingdom between the area controlled by the Assyrians and the Hittites.\nIts kings had names\n\np. xxx\n\nwhich are clearly Aryan. These included Saushatar, Artatatama, Sutarna, and\nTushratta. The latter was the correspondent in the Tel-el-Amarna letters of\nhis kinsmen the Egyptian Pharaohs, Amenhotep the Magnificent, and the famous\nAkhenaton. The two royal houses had intermarried after the wars of Thothmes\nIII. It is impossible to fix the date of the rise of the Mitanni power, which\nheld sway for a period over Assyria, but we know that it existed in 1500 B.C.\nThe horse was introduced into Egypt before 1580 B.C.\n\nIt is generally believed that the Aryans were the tamers of the horse which\nrevolutionized warfare in ancient days, and caused great empires to be\noverthrown and new empires to be formed. When the Aryans entered India they\nhad chariots and swift steeds.\n\nThere is no general agreement as to the date of settlement in the Punjab. Some\nauthorities favour 2000 B.C., others 1700 B.C.; Professor Macdonell still\nadheres to 1200 B.C. 1 It is possible that the infusion was at first a gradual\none, and that it was propelled by successive folk-waves. The period from the\nearliest migrations until about 800 or 700 B.C. is usually referred to as the\nVedic Age, during which the Vedas, or more particularly the invocatory hymns\nto the deities, were composed and compiled. At the close of this Age the area\nof Aryan control had extended eastward as far as the upper reaches of the\nJumna and Ganges rivers. A number of tribal states or communities are referred\nto in the hymns.\n\nIt is of importance to note that the social and religious organization of the\nVedic Aryans was based upon the principle of "father right", as contrasted\nwith the principle of "mother right", recognized by representative communities\nof the Brown race.\n\np. xxxi\n\nLike the Alpine and Mongoloid peoples, the Vedic Aryans were a patriarchal\npeople, mainly pastoral but with some knowledge of agriculture. They\nworshipped gods chiefly: their goddesses were vague and shadowy: their earth\ngoddess Prithivi was not a Great Mother in the Egyptian and early European\nsense; her husband was the sky-god Dyaus.\n\nIn Egypt the sky was symbolized as the goddess Nut, and the earth as the god\nSeb, but the Libyans had an earth-goddess Neith. The "Queen of Heaven" was a\nBabylonian and Assyrian deity. If the Brown race predominated in the Aryan\nblend during the Vedic Age, we should have found the Great Mother more in\nprominence.\n\nThe principal Aryan deities were Indra, god of thunder, and Agni, god of fire,\nto whom the greater number of hymns were addressed. From the earliest times,\nhowever, Aryan religion was of complex character. We can trace at least two\nsources of cultural influence from the earlier Iranian period. 1 The hymns\nbear evidence of the declining splendour of the sublime deities Varuna and\nMitra (Mithra). It is possible that the conflicts to which references are made\nin some of the hymns were not unconnected with racial or tribal religious\nrivalries.\n\nIndra, as we show ([Chapter I](iml06.htm#ch01)), bears resemblances to other\n"hammer gods". He is the Indian Thor, the angry giant-killer, the god of war\nand conquests. That his name even did not originate in India is made evident\nby an inscription at Boghaz Koi, in Asia Minor, referring to a peace treaty\nbetween the kings of the Hittites and Mitanni. Professor Hugo Winckler has\ndeciphered from this important survival of antiquity "In-da-ra" as a Mitanni\n\np. xxxii\n\ndeity who was associated with Varuna, Mitra, and Nasatya.\n\nNo evidence has yet been forthcoming to indicate any connection between the\nAryans in Mitanni and the early settlers in India. It would appear, however,\nthat the two migrations represented by the widely separated areas of Aryan\ncontrol, radiated from a centre where the gods Indra, Varuna, and Mitra were\ngrouped in the official religion. The folk-wave which pressed towards the\nPunjab gave recognition to Agni, possibly as a result of contact, or, more\nprobably, fusion with a tribe of specialized fire-worshippers.\n\nIf we separate the Indra from the Agni, cremating worshippers, it will be of\ninterest to follow the ethnic clue which is thus suggested. Modern-day Hindus\nburn their dead in accordance with the religious practice of the Agni\nworshippers in the Vedic Age. It is doubtful, however, if all the Aryan\ninvaders practised cremation. There are references to burial in the "house of\nclay", and Yama, god of the dead, was adored as the first man who explored the\npath to the "Land of the Pitris" (Fathers) which lay across the mountains.\nProfessor Oldenberg considers that these burials referred to the disposal of\nthe bones and ashes of the dead.\n\nProfessor Macdonell and Dr. Keith, however, do not share Professor Oldenberg\'s\nview in this connection. 1 They hold that the epithet _Agni-dagdhah_ , "burnt\nwith fire", "applies to the dead who were burned on the funeral pyre"; the\nother custom being burial-- _An-agni-dagdhah_ , "not burnt with fire". They\nalso refer to _Paroptah_ , "casting out", and _Uddhitah_ , "Exposure of the\ndead", which are expressions of doubtful meaning\n\np. xxxiii\n\n[paragraph continues] These authorities add: "Burial was clearly not rare in\nthe Rigvedic period: a whole hymn (x, 18) describes the ritual attending it.\nThe dead man was buried apparently in full attire, with his bow in his hand,\nand probably at one time his wife was immolated to accompany him. . . . But in\nthe Vedic period both customs appear in a modified form: the son takes the bow\nfrom the hand of the dead man, and the widow is led away from her dead husband\nby his brother or nearest kinsman. A stone is set up between the dead and the\nliving to separate them."\n\nThe Persian fire-worshippers, on the other hand, did not cremate their dead,\nbut exposed them on "towers of silence" to be devoured by vultures, like their\nmodern-day representatives the Parsees, who migrated into India after\ndisplacement by the Mohammedans. In Persia the sacred fire was called Atar, 1\nand was identified with the supreme deity Ahura-Mazda (Ormuzd).\n\nAgni of the Vedic Age is the messenger between gods and men; he conducts the\ndeities to the sacrifice and the souls of the cremated dead to Paradise; he is\nalso the twin brother of Indra.\n\nNow, it is of interest to note, in considering the racial significance of\nburial rites, that cremation was not practised by the western representatives\nof the Brown race. In pre-Dynastic Egypt the dead were interred as in Babylon,\n2 with food vessels, &c. Neolithic man in Europe also favoured crouched\nburials, and this practice obtained all through the Bronze Age.\n\nThe Buriats, who are Mongols dwelling in the vicinity of Lake Baikal, still\nperpetuate ancient customs, which\n\np. xxxiv\n\nresemble those of the Vedic Aryans, for they not only practise cremation but\nalso sacrifice the horse (see [Chap. V](iml10.htm#ch05)). In his important\nstudy of this remarkable people, Mr. Curtin says: 1 "The Buriats usually burn\ntheir dead; occasionally, however, there is what is called a \'Russian burial\',\nthat is, the body is placed in a coffin and the coffin is put in the ground.\nBut generally if a man dies in the Autumn or the Winter his body is placed on\na sled and drawn by the horse which he valued most to some secluded place in\nthe forest. There a sort of house is built of fallen trees and boughs, the\nbody is placed inside the house, and the building is then surrounded with two\nor three walls of logs so that no wolf or other animal can get into it." The\nhorse is afterwards slain. "If other persons die during the winter their\nbodies are carried to the same house. In this lonely silent place in the\nforest they rest through the days and nights until the first cuckoo calls,\nabout the ninth of May. Then relatives and friends assemble, and without\nopening the house burn it to the ground. Persons who die afterwards and during\nthe Summer months are carried to the forest, placed on a funeral pile, and\nburned immediately. The horse is killed just as in the first instance."\n\nWhen the dead are buried without being burned, the corpse is either carried on\na wagon, or it is placed upright in front of a living man on horseback so as\nto ride to its last resting place. The saddle is broken up and laid at the\nbottom of the grave, while the body is turned to face the south-east. In this\ncase they also sacrifice the horse which is believed to have "gone to his\nmaster, ready for use\n\nCremation spread throughout Europe, as we have said,\n\np. xxxv\n\nin the Bronze Age. It was not practised by the early folk-waves of the Alpine\nrace which, according to Mosso, 1 began to arrive after copper came into use.\nThe two European Bronze Age burial customs, associated with urns of the "food\nvessel" and "drinking cup" types, have no connection with the practice of\nburning the dead. The Archaeological Ages have not necessarily an ethnic\nsignificance. Ripley is of opinion, however, that the practice of cremation\nindicates a definite racial infusion, but unfortunately it has destroyed the\nvery evidence, of which we are most in need, to solve the problem. It is\nimpossible to say whether the cremated dead were "broad heads" or "long\nheads".\n\n"Dr. Sophus Muller of Copenhagen is of opinion that cremation was not\npractised long before the year 1000 B.C. though it appeared earlier in the\nsouth of Europe than in the north. On both points Professor Ridgeway of\nCambridge agrees with him." 2\n\nThe migration of the cremating people through Europe was westward and\nsouthward and northward; they even swept through the British Isles as far\nnorth as Orkney. They are usually referred to by archaeologists as "Aryans";\nsome identify them with the mysterious Celts, whom the French, however, prefer\nto associate, as we have said, with the Alpine "broad heads" especially as\nthis type bulks among the Bretons and the hillmen of France. We must be\ncareful, however, to distinguish between the Aryans and Celts of the\nphilologists and archaeologists.\n\nIt may be that these invaders were not a race in the proper sense, but a\nmilitary confederacy which maintained a religious organization formulated in\nsome unknown area where they existed for a time as a nation. The Normans\n\np. xxxvi\n\nwho invaded these islands were Scandinavians 1; they settled in France,\nintermarried with the French, and found allies among the Breton chiefs. It is\npossible that the cremating people similarly formed military aristocracies\nwhen they settled in Hindustan, Mitanni, and in certain other European areas.\n"Nothing is commoner in the history of migratory peoples," says Professor\nMyres, 2" than to find a very small leaven of energetic intruders ruling and\norganizing large native populations, without either learning their subjects\'\nlanguage or imposing their own till considerably later, if at all." The\narchaeological evidence in this connection is of particular value. At a famous\nsite near Salzburg, in upper Austria, over a thousand Bronze Age graves were\ndiscovered, just over half of which contained unburnt burials. Both methods of\ninterment were contemporary in this district, "but it was noticed that the\ncremated burials were those of the wealthier class, or of the dominant race."\n3 We find also that at Hallstatt "the bodies of the wealthier class were\nreduced to ashes". 4 In some districts the older people may have maintained\ntheir supremacy. At Watsch and St. Margaret in Carniola "a similar blending of\nthe two rites was observed . . . the unburnt burials being the richer and more\nnumerous". 5 The descent of the Achaens into Greece occurred at a date earlier\nthan the rise of the great Hallstatt civilization. According to Homeric\nevidence they burned their dead; "though the body of Patroklos was cremated,"\nhowever, "the lords of Mycenae were interred unburnt in richly furnished\ngraves". 6 In Britain the cremating people mingled with their predecessors\nperhaps more intimately\n\n\n\n[![THE CREMATION GHAT, BENARES](tn/_03600.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/_03600.jpg)  \nTHE CREMATION GHAT, BENARES  \n\n\n\np. xxxvii\n\nthan in other areas where there were large states to conquer. A characteristic\nfind on Acklam Wold, Yorkshire, may be referred to. In this grave "a pile of\nburnt bones was in close contact with the legs of a skeleton buried in the\nusual contracted position, and they seemed to have been deposited while yet\nhot, for the knees of the skeleton were completely charred. It has been\nsuggested in cases like this, or where an unburnt body is surrounded by a ring\nof urn burials, the entire skeleton may be those of chiefs or heads of\nfamilies, and the burnt bones those of slaves, or even wives, sacrificed at\nthe funeral. The practice of suttee (sati) in Europe rests indeed on the\nauthority of Julius Caesar, who represents such religious suicides as having,\nat no remote period from his own, formed a part of the funeral rites of the\nGaulish chiefs; and also states that the relatives of a deceased chieftain\naccused his wives of being accessory to his death, and often tortured them to\ndeath on that account." 1 If this is the explanation, the cremating invaders\nconstituted the lower classes in Gaul and Britain, which is doubtful. The\npractice of burning erring wives, however, apparently prevailed among the\nMediterranean peoples. In an Egyptian folk-tale a Pharaoh ordered a faithless\nwife of a scribe to be burned at the stake. 2 One of the Ossianic folk tales\nof Scotland relates that Grainne, wife of Finn-mac-Coul, who eloped with\nDiarmid, was similarly dealt with. 3 The bulk of the archaeological evidence\nseems to point to the invaders, who are usually referred to as "Aryans" having\nintroduced the cremation ceremony into Europe. Whence came they? The problem\nis greatly complicated by the evidence from Palestine, where cremation was\npractised by the hewers of the great artificial caves which were constructed\nabout\n\np. xxxviii\n\n[paragraph continues] 3000 B.C. 1 As cremation did not begin in Crete,\nhowever, until the end of period referred to as "Late Minoan Third" (1450-1200\nB.C.) 2 it may be that the Palestinian burials are much later than the\nconstruction of the caves.\n\nIt seems reasonable to suppose that the cremation rite originated among a\nnomadic people. The spirits of the dead were got rid of by burning the body:\nthey departed, like the spirit of Patroklos, after they had received their\n"meed of fire". Burial sites were previously regarded as sacred because they\nwere haunted by the spirits of ancestors (the Indian _Pitris_ = "fathers"). A\npeople who burned their dead, and were therefore not bound by attachment to a\ntribal holy place haunted by spirits, were certainly free to wander. The\nspirits were transferred by fire to an organized Hades, which appears to have\nbeen conceived of by a people who had already attained to a certain social\norganization and were therefore capable of governing the communities which\nthey subdued. When they mingled with peoples practising other rites and\nprofessing different religious beliefs, however, the process of racial fusion\nmust have been accompanied by a fusion of beliefs. Ultimately the burial\ncustoms of the subject race might prevail. At any rate, this appears to have\nbeen the case in Britain, where, prior to the Roman Age, the early people\nachieved apparently an intellectual conquest of their conquerors; the practice\nof the cremation rite entirely vanished.\n\nWe have gone far afield to find a clue to assist towards the solution of the\nAryan problem in India. The evidence accumulated is certainly suggestive, and\nshows that the conclusions of the early philologists have been narrow in the\nextreme. If the long-headed Kurds are, as Ripley\n\np. xxxix\n\nbelieves, the descendants of the Mitanni raiders, then the Aryans of history\nmust be included in the Brown race. As, however, cremation was not practised\nby the Berbers, the Babylonians, the early Cretans, or other representatives\nof the ancient brunet dolichocephalic peoples, it may be that the custom,\nwhich still lingers among the Mongolian Buriats, was not in the narrow sense\nof Aryan origin. It may have been first practised among an unknown tribe of\nfire-worshippers, who came under the influence of a great teacher like\nZoroaster. We cannot overlook in this connection the possibility of an\nindividual origin for a new and revolutionary system of religious doctrines.\nBuddhism, for instance, originated with Buddha.\n\nAs we have said, the Vedic religion of the Aryans in India was characterized\nby the worship of male deities, the goddesses being of secondary and even\nslight importance. A religious revolution, however, occurred during the second\nor Brahmanical Age--the age of priestly ascendancy. Fresh invasions had taken\nplace and the Aryans were divided into tribal groups of Westerners and\nEasterners, on either side of a central power in Madhyadesa, the "Middle\nCountry" which extended between the upper reaches of the Saraswati and the\nGanges and the Jumna rivers. The Westerners included the peoples of the Punjab\nand the north-western frontier, and the Easterners the kingdoms of Kasi\n(Benares) and Maghadha as well as Kosala and Videha, which figure prominently\nin the _Ram ayana_ epic, where the kings are referred to as being of the\n"Solar race". The Middle Kingdom was the centre of Brahmanical culture and\ninfluence: it was controlled by those federated tribes, the Kuru Panchalas,\nwith whom were fused the Bharatas of the "Lunar race". It is believed that the\nmilitary aristocracy of the "Middle Country" were late comers\n\np. xl\n\nwho arrived by a new route and thrust themselves between the groups of early\nsettlers. 1 The Bharatas worshipped a goddess Bharati who was associated with\nthe Saraswati river on the banks of which the tribe had for a period been\nlocated. Saraswati became the wife of Brahma, the supreme god, and it would\nseem that she had a tribal significance.\n\nIf the Bharatas of the "Lunar race" worshipped the moon and rivers, it is\npossible that they belonged to the Brown race. The folk-religion of the tribe\nwould be perpetuated by the people even although their priests became\nspeculative thinkers like the unknown authors of the _Upanishads_. It is\nsignificant to note, therefore, that the goddesses ultimately came into as\ngreat prominence in India as in Egypt. This change took place during the\nobscure period prior to the revival of Brahmanism. In the sixth century before\nthe Christian era Buddhism had origin, partly as a revolt of the Kshatriya\n(aristocratic) class against priestly ascendancy, and the new faith spread\neastward where Brahmanic influence was least pronounced. When the influence of\nBuddhism declined, the Pantheon is found to have been revolutionized and\nrendered thoroughly Mediterranean in character. The Vedic gods had in the\ninterval suffered eclipse; they were subject to the greater personal gods\nBrahma, with Vishnu and Shiva, each of whom had a goddess for wife. Brahma, as\nwe have said, had associated with him the river deity Saraswati of the\nBharatas; the earth goddess, Lakshmi, was the wife of Vishnu; she rose,\nhowever, from the Ocean of Milk. But the most distinctive and even most\nprimitive goddesses were linked with Shiva, the Destroyer. The goddess Durga\nrivalled Indra as a deity of war. Kali, another form of Durga, was as vengeful\nand bloodthirsty\n\n\n\n[![KALI<br> <i>From a bronze in the Calcutta Art Gallery</i>](tn/_04000.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/_04000.jpg)  \nKALI  \n_From a bronze in the Calcutta Art Gallery_  \n\n\n\np. xli\n\nas the Scottish Cailleach, or the Egyptian Hathor, who, as the earlier Sekhet,\nrejoiced in accomplishing the slaughter of the enemies of Ra. 1 Kali, as we\nshall see ([Chapter VIII](iml13.htm#ch08)) replaced the Vedic king of the gods\nas a successful demon slayer. As the Egyptian Ra went forth to restrain\nHathor, so did Shiva hasten to the battlefield, flooded by gore, to prevail\nupon his spouse Kali to spare the remnant of her enemies.\n\nThe rise of the goddesses may have been due in part to the influence of\nDravidian folk-religion. This does not, however, vitiate the theory that moon,\nwater, and earth worship was not unconnected with the ascendancy of the Brown\nrace in India. The Dravidian brunet long heads were, as we have said, probably\nrepresented in the pre-Aryan, as well as the post-Vedic folk-waves, which\nmingled with pre-Dravidian stocks. Mr. Crooke inclines to the view that the\nAryan conquest was more moral and intellectual than racial. 2 The decline of\nthe patriarchal religion of the Vedic military aristocracy may thus be\naccounted for; the religious practices of the earlier people might ultimately\nhave attained prominence in fusion with imported ideas. If the Aryan racial\ntype was distinctive, as it appears to have been, in colour at any rate, the\npredominant people who flourished when the hymns were composed, may have\ngreatly declined in numbers owing to the ravages of disease which in every new\ncountry eliminates the unfit in the process of time. Even if Aryan conquest\nwas more racial in character than Mr. Crooke will allow, the physical\nphenomena of the present day can be accounted for in this way, due allowance\nbeing made, of course, for the crossment of types. In all countries which have\nsustained the shock of invasion, the tendency to revert to the aboriginal type\nis very marked.\n\np. xlii\n\n[paragraph continues] At any rate, this is the case in Egypt and Crete as\npresent-day evidence shows. In Great Britain, which was invaded by the broad\nheads of the Bronze Age, the long-headed type is once again in the majority; a\nnot inconsiderable proportion of our people show Stone Age (Mediterranean)\nphysical characteristics.\n\nIn this connection it is of interest to refer to immemorial beliefs and\ncustoms which survive in representative districts in Britain and India where\nwhat may be called pre-Aryan influences are most pronounced. A people may\nchange their weapons and their language time and again, and yet retain ancient\nmodes of thought. In Devon, which the philologists claim to be largely Celtic\nlike Cornwall, the folk-lore shows marked affinities with that of Ireland,\nWales, and Scotland, suggesting the survival of ancient Mediterranean racial\ninfluence, for much of what we call Celtic links with what belongs to ancient\nGreece and the Egyptian Delta. Mr. Gomme has shown 1 in an interesting summary\nof recorded folk-practices that the "ram feast" of Devon resembles closely in\nessential details similar ceremonies in ancient Greece and modern India. At\nthe beginning of May the people of Devon were wont to sacrifice a ram lamb to\nthe deity of waters. The animal was tied to a pillar, its throat was cut, and\nyoung men scrambled to obtain pieces of its flesh for girls. The devourer was\nassured of good luck during the year. After the ceremony, dancing, wrestling,\nand drinking were indulged in. A comparison is drawn between this and similar\nrites among the ancient Semites and ancient Greeks. In India a Dravidian Paria\nacts as the temporary village priest. He uses a whip like the "gad whip" in\nLincolnshire, and kills the lamb by tearing its throat with his teeth. A\nscramble takes place for the flesh, the people\n\np. xliii\n\ncirculate the village, as some communities in our own country still perpetuate\nthe ceremony of "riding the marches" of ancient burghs; then universal licence\nprevails. Similarly law was suspended at the ancient Scottish Hallowe\'en\ncelebrations; in some districts even in our own day Hallowe\'en and New Year\npractical jokes and rowdyism is still prevalent. Herodotus refers to the\nuniversal licence and debauchery which characterized the Isis festival in\nEgypt.\n\nA remarkable feature of post-Vedic religion in ancient India is the prominence\ngiven to the doctrine of metempsychosis (transmigration of souls) and the\nconception of the yugas or ages of the universe.\n\nIn _Rigveda_ the soul of the dead proceeds at once, or at any rate after\nburial, towards the next world. In one passage only is it spoken of "as\ndeparting to the waters or the plants", and this reference, Professor\nMacdonell suggests, 1 "may contain the germs of the theory" of transmigration.\nIn the speculative prose treatises, the _Upanishads_ , which were composed in\nthe Middle Country, the doctrine of metempsychosis is fully expounded. It does\nnot follow, however, that it originated in India although it may have obtained\nthere unrecognized by the priestly poets who composed the hymns to the\ndeities, long before it became an essential tenet of orthodox or official\nreligion. Other representative communities of the Brown race professed this\ndoctrine which appears to have evolved from the vague belief shared by more\nthan one primitive race, that the souls of the dead, and especially of dead\nchildren, were ever on the outlook for suitable mothers. Even in Central\nAustralia a particular tribe has perpetuated "the germs of the theory", which\nmay also be traced in the widespread custom of visiting standing\n\np. xliv\n\nstones at a certain phase of the moon to perform a ceremony so that offspring\nmay be obtained. The Upanishadic doctrine of metempsychosis is less likely to\nhave been so much coincidental as racial when we find that it is restricted to\nthose areas where definite racial influences must have been at work. The\nGreeks believed in transmigration. So did also a section of the Egyptian\npeople as Herodotus has stated and as is proved by references in folk-tales,\ntemple chants and inscriptions. 1 As we show ([Chapter VI](iml11.htm#ch06)),\nthe Irish conception closely resembled the Indian, and it also obtained among\nthe Gauls. There is no trace, however, that the Teutonic peoples were\nacquainted with the fully developed doctrine of metempsychosis; the souls of\nthe dead departed immediately to Valhal, Hela, or the loathsome Nifelhel.\n\nThe doctrine of the world\'s ages is common to the Indian, Greek, and Irish\nmythologies, but is not found in Teutonic mythology either. 2 There are\nindications that it may have at one time obtained in Egypt, for there was an\nAge of Ra, then a deluge, an Age of Osiris, an Age of Set, &c.; but the\ndoctrine, like other conceptions in Egypt, probably suffered from the process\nof priestly transformation in the interests of sectarian propaganda.\n\nIn India the ages are called the yugas, and this term has a totally different\nmeaning in Vedic and Upanishadic times. Evidently the Bharata invasion and the\nestablishment of the middle country power of their allies, the Kuru-Panchalas,\nwas not unconnected with the introduction of the doctrines of metempsychosis\nand the yugas, and the prominence subsequently given to the worship of female\ndeities.\n\np. xlv\n\nIf this theory can be established, we are confronted by an extremely\ninteresting problem. It would appear that the mythology of the Vedic period\nbears a close resemblance to Teutonic, while that of the post-Vedic period\nconnects more intimately with Greek, Celtic, and Egyptian. Assuming that the\nVedic people were influenced by what we recognize as Teutonic modes of\nthought, do we find here proof that the Aryans came from Europe? In [Chapter\nII](iml07.htm#ch02) it is shown that the Norse Heimdal displays points of\nresemblance to Agni. The former, however, has been developed almost beyond\nrecognition as a fire god, and it is evident that we find him in northern\nEurope in his latest and most picturesque form. On the other hand, there is no\ndubiety about the origin of the Vedic Agni.\n\nThe evidence afforded by archaeology is highly suggestive in this connection.\nScandinavia received its culture from the south at a comparatively late period\nin the Bronze Age, and it certainly exercised no intellectual influence in\nEurope in earlier times. Bronze is, of course, of less ethnic significance\nthan beliefs, but it is difficult to believe, at the same time, that an\nisolated and poorly armed people could have imposed its intellectual culture\nover a wide area without having received anything in return. It is more\nprobable that the northern Germanic peoples were subjected to the same\ninfluences which are traceable in their mythology and in the Vedic hymns, from\na common source, and there may be more than mere mythology in the persistent\ntradition that the ancestors of the Teutons immigrated from Asia led by Odin.\nWe need not assume that the movement was so much a racial as a cultural one,\nwhich emanated from a particular area where religious conceptions were\ninfluenced by particular habits of life and "immemorial modes of\n\np. xlvi\n\nthought". Among the settled and agricultural peoples of the Brown race, the\ndevelopment of religious ideas followed different lines, and were similarly\ncontrolled by early ideas which sprang from different habits and experiences.\n\nIn the opening chapters we present various phases of Aryan life and religion\nin India, beginning with the worship of Indra, and concluding with the early\nstages of modern Hinduism. From the ancient tribal struggles of the Middle\nCountry accumulated the hero songs which received epic treatment in the _Mah\nabharata_, while the traditions of the "Easterners" were enshrined in the _R\namayana_. Although neither of these great works can be regarded as historical\nnarratives, they contain a mass of historical matter which throws much light\non the habits and customs and beliefs of the early peoples.\n\nThese epics were utilized by Brahmanical compilers for purposes of religious\npropaganda, and survive to us mainly as sacred books. In our pages we have\ngiven prominence to the heroic narrative which remains embedded in the mass of\ndoctrinal treatises and mythological interpolations. The miraculous element is\nsomewhat toned down in the accounts of conflicts, and the more dramatic phases\nof the heroic stories are presented in as full detail as space permits, so as\nto afford our readers glimpses of ancient life in northern India at a time\nwhen Vedic religion still held sway. This applies especially to the _Mah\nabharata_, the kernel of which, no doubt, contains the hero songs of the\nBharata and other tribes. The mythical conflicts of the _R amayana_ appeal\nless to western minds than its purely human episodes. We cannot help being\nimpressed by the chivalrous character of the leading heroes, the high sense of\nhonour displayed by the princes, and the obedience shown by sons to their\nparents. We may weary of Rama\'s conflicts with giants and demons,\n\np. xlvii\n\nbut will long remember him as the child who pronounced his name as "\'Ama" and\ncried for the moon, or sat on his father\'s knee at meetings of the State\nCouncil. Our interest will also abide with him as a lover and a faithful\nhusband who suffered wrong. His brothers are noble and heroic characters,\nworthy of Shakespeare. But even the Bard of Avon never depicted more wonderful\nand fascinating women than the heroines of the _Mah abharata_ and _R amayana_.\nOur gallery includes, among others, the noble and self-sacrificing Savitri,\nwho rescued her husband from the clutches of death by exercise of her strong\nlove and devotion; the faithful and virtuous Sita, and the sorrowful and\nconstant Damayanti, and beautiful Shakuntala. In western literature romance\nusually ends with marriage; in India the devotion of wives is of more account\nthan the yearnings of love-smitten Juliets on moonlight nights.\n\nAnother aspect of Sanskrit literature is the feeling of the poets for Nature.\nThese voluminous writers revelled in the luxuriant loveliness and splendour of\nIndian forests, and the charms of gleaming valleys and serene, snow-capped\nmountains; even the gods loved to hear the hum of insects and the songs of\nmelodious birds, and, like mortals, to gather flowers of sweet scents and\nbrilliant colours. Hundreds of songs were sung in praise of the lotus blooms\nthat gemmed the clear waters of lakes and ponds, and Paradise was pictured as\na jungle of beauty, fanned by soft winds, radiant with blossoms, and ever\nvocal with music and song. To illustrate this phase of India\'s classic\nliterature, we reproduce at length the representative story of Nala with much\nof its poetic details.\n\nThe civilization revealed by the narrative poems was of no mean order. The\nancient Aryans were chivalrous knights. No such barbaric incident occurs in\nthe _Mah abharata_ battles as when in the _Iliad_ the victorious\n\np. xlviii\n\n[paragraph continues] Achilles drags behind his chariot the body of the slain\nHector. When Arjuna, the Indian Achilles, slays Karna, the Indian Hector, he\nhonours his fallen foe and performs those rites at the funeral pyre which\nassures the dead hero immortal bliss in Paradise. When, again, Arjuna mortally\nwounds Bhishma, he procures water to quench the thirst of his dying opponent.\nEven the villains are not without their redeeming qualities. Duryodhana of the\n_Mah abharata_, who consents to the slaughter of his sleeping rivals, dies\nwith grief because the innocent children of his enemies were slain. Ravana,\nthe demon king of Ceylon, touches us in the _R amayana_ by his grief for his\nson, who was slain fighting against Laksmana, brother of Rama.\n\nTo appreciate fully the sacred and romantic literature of India, we should\nfollow the advice of Robert Louis Stevenson. "To learn aright from any\nteacher," he wrote, "we must first of all, like a historical artist, think\nourselves into sympathy with his position." And if in endeavouring to\nunderstand the religious conceptions of the ancient forest sages, we, at\ntimes, find ourselves in difficulties, it may be that "if a saying is hard to\nunderstand, it is because we are thinking of something else"--we are looking\non India with European eyes and with European prejudices. "There is always",\nsaid Stevenson, "a ruling spirit behind the code of rules, an attitude, a\nrelation, a point of the compass, in virtue of which we conform or dissent." 1\n\nWe are confident that our readers who peruse with sympathy and, we hope, with\nenjoyment, the chapters which follow, will feel themselves drawn closer than\nhitherto to the millions of our fellow subjects in the great dependency of the\nBritish Empire, by whom Rama and Yudhishthira are regarded as ideal types of\nstrong manhood, and Savitri and Sita as perfect women and exemplary lovers and\nwives.\n\n\n\n[![A VYASA, OR PUBLIC READER, RECITING THE MAHABHARATA](tn/_04800.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/_04800.jpg)  \nA VYASA, OR PUBLIC READER, RECITING THE MAHABHARATA  \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xx:1](iml05.htm#fr_0) Romesh C.
