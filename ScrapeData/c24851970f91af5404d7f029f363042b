Then therefore the enquiry into Brahman.\n\nIn this Sutra the word 'then' expresses immediate sequence; the word\n'therefore' intimates that what has taken place (viz. the study of the karmaka\n_nd_ a of the Veda) constitutes the reason (of the enquiry into Brahman). For\nthe fact is that the enquiry into (lit.'the desire to know') Brahman--the\nfruit of which enquiry is infinite in nature and permanent--follows\nimmediately in the case of him who, having read the Veda together with its\nauxiliary\n\np. 4\n\ndisciplines, has reached the knowledge that the fruit of mere works is limited\nand non-permanent, and hence has conceived the desire of final release.\n\nThe compound 'brahma _g_ i _g \xc3\xb1_asa' is to be explained as 'the enquiry of\nBrahman,' the genitive case 'of Brahman' being understood to denote the\nobject; in agreement with the special rule as to the meaning of the genitive\ncase, Pa _n_ ini II, 3, 65. It might be said that even if we accepted the\ngeneral meaning of the genitive case--which is that of connexion in general--\nBrahman's position (in the above compound) as an object would be established\nby the circumstance that the 'enquiry' demands an object; but in agreement\nwith the principle that the direct denotation of a word is to be preferred to\na meaning inferred we take the genitive case 'of Brahman' as denoting the\nobject.\n\nThe word 'Brahman' denotes the hightest Person (purushottama), who is\nessentially free from all imperfections and possesses numberless classes of\nauspicious qualities of unsurpassable excellence. The term 'Brahman' is\napplied to any things which possess the quality of greatness (b _ri_ hattva,\nfrom the root 'b _ri_ h'); but primarily denotes that which possesses\ngreatness, of essential nature as well as of qualities, in unlimited fulness;\nand such is only the Lord of all. Hence the word 'Brahman' primarily denotes\nhim alone, and in a secondary derivative sense only those things which possess\nsome small part of the Lord's qualities; for it would be improper to assume\nseveral meanings for the word (so that it would denote primarily or directly\nmore than one thing). The case is analogous to that of the term 'bhagavat 1.'\nThe Lord only is enquired into, for the sake of immortality, by all those who\nare afflicted with the triad of pain. Hence the Lord of all is that Brahman\nwhich, according to the Sutra, constitutes the object of enquiry. The word '\n_g_ i _g \xc3\xb1_asa' is a desiderative formation meaning 'desire to know.' And as\nin the\n\np. 5\n\ncase of any desire the desired object is the chief thing, the Sutra means to\nenjoin knowledge--which is the object of the desire of knowledge. The purport\nof the entire Sutra then is as follows: 'Since the fruit of works known\nthrough the earlier part of the Mima _m_ sa is limited and non-permanent, and\nsince the fruit of the knowledge of Brahman--which knowledge is to be reached\nthrough the latter part of the Mima _m_ sa\\--is unlimited and permanent; for\nthis reason Brahman is to be known, after the knowledge of works has\npreviously taken place.'--The same meaning is expressed by the V _ri_ ttikara\nwhen saying 'after the comprehension of works has taken place there follows\nthe enquiry into Brahman.' And that the enquiry into works and that into\nBrahman constitute one body of doctrine, he (the V _ri_ ttikara) will declare\nlater on 'this Sariraka-doctrine is connected with _G_ aimini's doctrine as\ncontained in sixteen adhyayas; this proves the two to constitute one body of\ndoctrine.' Hence the earlier and the later Mima _m_ sa are separate only in so\nfar as there is a difference of matter to be taught by each; in the same way\nas the two halves of the Purva Mima _m_ sa-sutras, consisting of six adhyayas\neach, are separate 1; and as each adhyaya is separate. The entire Mima _m_ sa-\nsatra--which begins with the Sutra 'Now therefore the enquiry into religious\nduty' and concludes with the Sutra '(From there is) no return on account of\nscriptural statement'--has, owing to the special character of the contents, a\ndefinite order of internal succession. This is as follows. At first the\nprecept 'one is to learn one's own text (svadhyaya)' enjoins the apprehension\nof that aggregate of syllables which is called 'Veda,' and is here referred to\nas 'svadhyaya.' Next there arises the desire to know of what nature the\n'Learning' enjoined is to be, and how it is to be done. Here there come in\ncertain injunctions such as\n\np. 6\n\n[paragraph continues] 'Let a Brahnmana be initiated in his eighth year' and\n'The teacher is to make him recite the Veda'; and certain rules about special\nobservances and restrictions--such as 'having performed the upakarman on the\nfull moon of _S_ rava _n_ a or Praush _th_ apada according to prescription, he\nis to study the sacred verses for four months and a half--which enjoin all the\nrequired details.\n\nFrom all these it is understood that the study enjoined has for its result the\napprehension of the aggregate of syllables called Veda, on the part of a pupil\nwho has been initiated by a teacher sprung from a good family, leading a\nvirtuous life, and possessing purity of soul; who practises certain special\nobservances and restrictions; and who learns by repeating what is recited by\nthe teacher.\n\nAnd this study of the Veda is of the nature of a sa _m_ skara of the text,\nsince the form of the injunction 'the Veda is to be studied' shows that the\nVeda is the object (of the action of studying). By a sa _m_ skara is\nunderstood an action whereby something is fitted to produce some other effect;\nand that the Veda should be the object of such a sa _m_ skaara is quite\nappropriate, since it gives rise to the knowledge of the four chief ends of\nhuman action--viz. religious duty, wealth, pleasure, and final release--and of\nthe means to effect them; and since it helps to effect those ends by itself\nalso, viz. by mere mechanical repetition (apart from any knowledge to which it\nmay give rise).\n\nThe injunction as to the study of the Veda thus aims only at the apprehension\nof the aggregate of syllables (constituting the Veda) according to certain\nrules; it is in this way analogous to the recital of mantras.\n\nIt is further observed that the Veda thus apprehended through reading\nspontaneously gives rise to the ideas of certain things subserving certain\npurposes. A person, therefore, who has formed notions of those things\nimmediately, i.e. on the mere apprehension of the text of the Veda through\nreading, thereupon naturally applies himself to the study of the Mima _m_ sa,\nwhich consists in a methodical discussion of the sentences constituting the\ntext of the\n\np. 7\n\n[paragraph continues] Veda, and has for its result the accurate determination\nof the nature of those things and their different modes. Through this study\nthe student ascertains the character of the injunctions of work which form\npart of the Veda, and observes that all work leads only to non-permanent\nresults; and as, on the other hand, he immediately becomes aware that the\nUpanishad sections--which form part of the Veda which he has apprehended\nthrough reading--refer to an infinite and permanent result, viz. immortality,\nhe applies himself to the study of the Sariraka-Mima _m_ sa, which consists in\na systematic discussion of the Vedanta-texts, and has for its result the\naccurate determination of their sense. That the fruit of mere works is\ntransitory, while the result of the knowledge of Brahman is something\npermanent, the Vedanta-texts declare in many places--'And as here the world\nacquired by work perishes, so there the world acquired by merit perishes' (\n_Kh_. Up. VIII, 1,6); 'That work of his has an end' (B _ri_. Up. III, 8, 10);\n'By non-permanent works the Permanent is not obtained' (Ka. Up. I, 2, 10);\n'Frail indeed are those boats, the sacrifices' (Mu. Up. I, 2, 7); 'Let a\nBrahma _n_ a, after he has examined all these worlds that are gained by works,\nacquire freedom from all desires. What is not made cannot be gained by what is\nmade. To understand this, let the pupil, with fuel in his hand, go to a\nteacher who is learned and dwells entirely in Brahman. To that pupil who has\napproached him respectfully, whose mind is altogether calm, the wise teacher\ntruly told that knowledge of Brahman through which he knows the imperishable\ntrue Person' (Mu. Up. I, 2, 12, l3). 'Told' here means 'he is to tell.'--On\nthe other hand, 'He who knows Brahman attains the Highest' (Taitt. Up. II, 1,\n1); 'He who sees this does not see death' ( _Kh_. Up. VII, 26, 2); 'He becomes\na self-ruler' ( _Kh_. Up. VII, 25, 2); 'Knowing him he becomes immortal here'\n(Taitt. \xc3\x82r. III, 12, 7); 'Having known him he passes over death; there is no\nother path to go' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 15); 'Having known as separate his Self\nand the Mover, pleased thereby he goes to immortality' ( _S_ vet. Up. I, 6).\n\np. 8\n\nBut--an objection here is raised--the mere learning of the Veda with its\nauxiliary disciplines gives rise to the knowledge that the heavenly world and\nthe like are the results of works, and that all such results are transitory,\nwhile immortality is the fruit of meditation on Brahman. Possessing such\nknowledge, a person desirous of final release may at once proceed to the\nenquiry into Brahman; and what need is there of a systematic consideration of\nreligious duty (i.e. of the study of the Purva Mima _m_ sa)?--If this\nreasoning were valid, we reply, tin--person desirous of release need not even\napply himself to the study of the Sariraka Mima _m_ sa, since Brahman is known\nfrom the mere reading of the Veda with its auxiliary disciplines.--True. Such\nknowledge arises indeed immediately (without deeper enquiry). But a matter\napprehended in this immediate way is not raised above doubt and mistake. Hence\na systematic discussion of the Vedanta-texts must he undertaken in order that\ntheir sense may be fully ascertained--We agree. But you will have to admit\nthat for the very same reason we must undertake a systematic enquiry into\nreligious duty!\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[4:1](sbe48004.htm#fr_0) 'Bhagavat' denotes primarily the Lord, the divintiy;\nsecondarily any holy person.\n\n[5:1](sbe48004.htm#fr_1) The first six books of the Purva Mima _m_ sa-sutras\ngive rules for the fundamental forms of the sacrifice; while the last six\nbooks teach how these rules are to be applied to the so-called modified forms.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Small Purvapaksha](sbe48005.htm)\n\n"
