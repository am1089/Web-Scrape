That mind (is merged) in breath, owing to the subsequent clause.\n\nIt has been shown that the passage, 'Speech is merged in mind,' means a\nmerging of the function only.--A doubt here arises whether the subsequent\nclause, 'mind in breath,' also means to intimate a merging of the function\nonly or of that to which the function belongs.--The purvapakshin maintains the\nlatter alternative. For that, he says, agrees with scripture, and moreover\nbreath may be viewed as the causal substance of mind. For scripture--'Mind is\nmade of earth, breath of water' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 6, 5)--states that mind comes\nfrom earth and breath from water, and scripture further states that 'Water\nsent forth earth' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 2, 4). When mind therefore is merged in\nbreath, it is the same as earth being merged in water; for mind is earth and\nbreath is water, causal substance and effect being non-different.\n\nTo this we reply as follows. 'The subsequent clause' intimates that the mind,\nafter having absorbed within itself the functions of the outer senses, is\nmerged in breath only in the way of its function being so merged. For we\nobserve in the case of persons lying in deep sleep or about to die that, while\nthe function of breath persists, the functions of the mind are stopped. Nor is\nthe mind capable of being itself merged in breath, since breath does not\nconstitute its causal substance.--But it has been shown above that breath is\nthe causal substance of mind!--This is not valid,\n\np. 367\n\nwe reply. For the relation of causality, made out in such an indirect way,\ndoes not suffice to show that mind is really merged in breath. Were it so,\nthen mind would also be merged in earth, earth in water, breath in water. Nor\nis there, on the alternative contemplated, any proof of mind having originated\nfrom that water which had passed over into breath.--Mind cannot therefore, in\nitself, be merged in breath. And that the scriptural statement is satisfied by\na mere merging of the function--the function and that to which the function\nbelongs being viewed as identical--has been shown already under the preceding\nSutra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 2, 4](sbe38284.htm)\n\n"
