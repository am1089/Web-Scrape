On account of seeing (i.e. thinking) that which is not founded on\nScripture (i.e. the Pradhana) is not (what is taught by the texts referring to\nthe origination of the world).\n\nWe have maintained that what is taught by the texts relative to the\norigination of the world is Brahman, omniscient, and so on. The present Sutra\nand the following Sutras now add that those texts can in no way refer to the\nPradhana and similar entities which rest on Inference only.\n\nWe read in the _Kh_ andogya, 'Being only was this in the beginning, one only,\nwithout a second.--It thought, may I be many, may I grow forth.--It sent forth\nfire' (VI, 2, 1 ff.)--Here a doubt arises whether the cause of the world\ndenoted by the term 'Being' is the Pradhana. assumed by others, which rests on\nInference, or Brahman as defined by us.\n\nThe Purvapakshin maintains that the Pradhana is meant. For he says, the _Kh_\nandogya text quoted expresses the causal state of what is denoted by the word\n'this', viz. the aggregate of things comprising manifold effects, such as\nether. &c., consisting of the three elements of Goodness,\n\np. 201\n\n[paragraph continues] Passion and Darkness, and forming the sphere of fruition\nof intelligent beings. By the 'effected' state we understand the assuming, on\nthe part of the causal substance, of a different condition; whatever therefore\nconstitutes the essential nature of a thing in its effected state the same\nconstitutes its essential nature in the causal state also. Now the effect, in\nour case, is made up of the three elements Goodness, Passion and Darkness;\nhence the cause is the Pradhana which consists in an equipoise of those three\nelements. And as in this Pradhana all distinctions are merged, so that it is\npure Being, the _Kh_ andogya text refers to it as 'Being, one only, without a\nsecond.' This establishes the non-difference of effect and cause, and in this\nway the promise that through the knowledge of one thing all things are to be\nknown admits of being fulfilled. Otherwise, moreover, there would be no\nanalogy between the instance of the lump of clay and the things made of it,\nand the matter to be illustrated thereby. The texts speaking of the\norigination of the world therefore intimate the Pradhana taught by the great\nSage Kapila. And as the _Kh_ andogya passage has, owing to the presence of an\ninitial statement (prati _g \xc3\xb1_a) and a proving instance, the form of an\ninference, the term 'Being' means just that which rests on inference, viz. the\nPradhana.\n\nThis prima facie view is set aside by the words of the Sutra. That which does\nnot rest on Scripture, i.e. the Pradhana, which rests on Inference only, is\nnot what is intimated by the texts referring to the origination of the world;\nfor the text exhibits the root 'iksh '--which means 'to think'--as denoting a\nspecial activity on the part of what is termed 'Being.' 'It thought, may I be\nmany, may I grow forth.' 'Thinking' cannot possibly belong to the non-sentient\nPradhana: the term 'Being' can therefore denote only the all-knowing highest\nPerson who is capable of thought. In agreement with this we find that, in all\nsections which refer to creation, the act of creation is stated to be preceded\nby thought. 'He thought, shall I send forth worlds. He sent forth these\nworlds' (Ait. \xc3\x82r. II, 4, 1, 2); 'He thought he sent forth Pra _n_ a' (Pr. Up.\nVI, 3);\n\np. 202\n\nand others.--But it is a rule that as a cause we must assume only what\ncorresponds to the effect!--Just so; and what corresponds to the total\naggregate of effects is the highest Person, all-knowing, all-powerful, whose\npurposes realise themselves, who has minds and matter in their subtle state\nfor his body. Compare the texts 'His high power is revealed as manifold, as\ninherent, acting as force and knowledge' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 8); 'He who is\nall-knowing, all-perceiving' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 9); 'He of whom the Unevolved is\nthe body, of whom the Imperishable is the body, of whom Death is the body, he\nis the inner Self of all things' (Subal. Up. VII).--This point (viz. as to the\nbody of the highest Person) will be established under Su. II, 1, 4. The\npresent Sutra declares that the texts treating of creation cannot refer to the\nPradhana; the Sutra just mentioned will dispose of objections. Nor is the\nPurvapakshin right in maintaining that the _Kh_ andogya passage is of the\nnature of an Inference; for it does not state a reason (hetu--which is the\nessential thing in an Inference). The illustrative instance (of the lump of\nclay) is introduced merely in order to convince him who considers it\nimpossible that all things should be known through one thing--as maintained in\nthe passage 'through which that is heard which was not heard,' &c.,--that this\n_is_ possible after all. And the mention made in the text of 'seeing' clearly\nshows that there is absolutely no intention of setting forth an Inference.\n\nLet us assume, then, the Purvapakshin resumes, that the 'seeing' of the text\ndenotes not 'seeing' in its primary, direct sense--such as belongs to\nintelligent beings only; but 'seeing' in a secondary, figurative sense which\nthere is ascribed to the Pradhana in the same way as in passages immediately\nfollowing it is ascribed to fire and water--'the fire saw'; 'the water saw' (\n_Kh_. Up. VI, 2, 3). The transference, to non-existent things, of attributes\nproperly belonging to sentient beings is quite common; as when we say 'the\nrice-fields look out for rain'; 'the rain delighted the seeds.'--This view is\nset aside by the next Sutra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 6. ...the word 'seeing' has a secondary (figurative)\nmeaning](sbe48039.htm)\n\n"
