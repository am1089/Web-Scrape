But the others, on account of equality with the thing.\n\nThose other qualities which are 'equal to the thing,' i. e. which are\nattributes determining the essential character of the thing, and therefore\nnecessarily entering into the idea of the thing, must be included in all\nmeditations, no less than the thing itself. To this class belong qualities\nsuch as true being, knowledge, bliss, purity, infinity, and so on. For of\nBrahman--which by texts such as 'that from which all these beings,' &c. had\nbeen suggested as the cause of the world--the essential definition is given in\ntexts such as 'the True, knowledge, infinite is Brahman'; 'bliss is Brahman,'\nand others; and hence, in order that a true notion may be formed of Brahman as\nthe object of meditation, such qualities as true being, bliss, and so on, have\nto be included in all meditations on Brahman. Such additional qualities, on\nthe other hand, as e.g. compassion, which indeed cannot exist apart from the\nsubject to which they belong, but are not necessary elements of the idea of\nBrahman, are to be included in those meditations only where they are specially\nmentioned.\n\nBut, an objection is raised, if 'having joy for its head ' and the like are\nnot qualities of Brahman, but merely serve the purpose of a figurative\nrepresentation of Brahman, for what purpose then is this representation\nintroduced? For if something is represented as something else, there must be\nsome motive for doing so. Where, e.g. the sacred text compares the meditating\ndevotee to a charioteer, its body\n\np. 639\n\nand organs to a chariot, and so on, it does so for the purpose of assisting\nthe subjection to the Self of the means of meditation, i.e. the body, the\nsenses, and so on. But in the present case no such purpose is to be discerned,\nand hence it must needs be admitted that having joy for its head, and so on,\nare real qualities of Brahman.--The next Sutra disposes of this difficulty.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 14.
