But the sun rises and the darkness is\ndispelled--a moment is sufficient to overcome an infinite distance.\n\nOne day there came the new era of _Swadeshi_  8 in Bengal; but as to how it\nhappened, we had no distinct vision. There was no gradual slope connecting the\npast with the present. For that reason, I imagine, the new epoch came in like\na flood, breaking down the dykes and sweeping all our prudence and fear before\nit. We had no time even to think about, or understand, what had happened, or\nwhat was about to happen.\n\nMy sight and my mind, my hopes and my desires, became red with the passion of\nthis new age. Though, up to this time, the walls of the home--which was the\nultimate world to my mind--remained unbroken, yet I stood looking over into\nthe distance, and I heard a voice from the far horizon, whose meaning was not\nperfectly clear to me, but whose call went straight to my heart.\n\nFrom the time my husband had been a college student he had been trying to get\nthe things required by our people produced in our own country. There are\nplenty of date trees in our district. He tried to invent an apparatus for\nextracting the juice and boiling it into sugar and treacle. I heard that it\nwas a great success, only it extracted more money than juice. After a while he\ncame to the conclusion that our attempts at reviving our industries were not\nsucceeding for want of a bank of our own. He was, at the time, trying to teach\nme political economy. This alone would not have done much harm, but he also\ntook it into his head to teach his countrymen ideas of thrift, so as to pave\nthe way for a bank; and then he actually started a small bank. Its high rate\nof interest, which made the villagers flock so enthusiastically to put in\ntheir money, ended by swamping the bank altogether.\n\nThe old officers of the estate felt troubled and frightened. There was\njubilation in the enemy\'s camp. Of all the family, only my husband\'s\ngrandmother remained unmoved. She would scold me, saying: "Why are you all\nplaguing him so? Is it the fate of the estate that is worrying you? How many\ntimes have I seen this estate in the hands of the court receiver! Are men like\nwomen? Men are born spendthrifts and only know how to waste. Look here, child,\ncount yourself fortunate that your husband is not wasting himself as well!"\n\nMy husband\'s list of charities was a long one. He would assist to the bitter\nend of utter failure anyone who wanted to invent a new loom or rice-husking\nmachine. But what annoyed me most was the way that Sandip Babu  9 used to\nfleece him on the pretext of _Swadeshi_ work. Whenever he wanted to start a\nnewspaper, or travel about preaching the Cause, or take a change of air by the\nadvice of his doctor, my husband would unquestioningly supply him with the\nmoney. This was over and above the regular living allowance which Sandip Babu\nalso received from him. The strangest part of it was that my husband and\nSandip Babu did not agree in their opinions.\n\nAs soon as the _Swadeshi_ storm reached my blood, I said to my husband: "I\nmust burn all my foreign clothes."\n\n"Why burn them?" said he. "You need not wear them as long as you please."\n\n"As long as I please! Not in this life ..."\n\n"Very well, do not wear them for the rest of your life, then. But why this\nbonfire business?"\n\n"Would you thwart me in my resolve?"\n\n"What I want to say is this: Why not try to build up something? You should not\nwaste even a tenth part of your energies in this destructive excitement."\n\n"Such excitement will give us the energy to build."\n\n"That is as much as to say, that you cannot light the house unless you set\nfire to it."\n\nThen there came another trouble. When Miss Gilby first came to our house there\nwas a great flutter, which afterwards calmed down when they got used to her.\nNow the whole thing was stirred up afresh. I had never bothered myself before\nas to whether Miss Gilby was European or Indian, but I began to do so now. I\nsaid to my husband: "We must get rid of Miss Gilby."\n\nHe kept silent.\n\nI talked to him wildly, and he went away sad at heart.\n\nAfter a fit of weeping, I felt in a more reasonable mood when we met at night.\n"I cannot," my husband said, "look upon Miss Gilby through a mist of\nabstraction, just because she is English. Cannot you get over the barrier of\nher name after such a long acquaintance? Cannot you realize that she loves\nyou?"\n\nI felt a little ashamed and replied with some sharpness: "Let her remain. I am\nnot over anxious to send her away." And Miss Gilby remained.\n\nBut one day I was told that she had been insulted by a young fellow on her way\nto church. This was a boy whom we were supporting. My husband turned him out\nof the house. There was not a single soul, that day, who could forgive my\nhusband for that act--not even I. This time Miss Gilby left of her own accord.\nShe shed tears when she came to say good-bye, but my mood would not melt. To\nslander the poor boy so--and such a fine boy, too, who would forget his daily\nbath and food in his enthusiasm for _Swadeshi_.\n\nMy husband escorted Miss Gilby to the railway station in his own carriage. I\nwas sure he was going too far. When exaggerated accounts of the incident gave\nrise to a public scandal, which found its way to the newspapers, I felt he had\nbeen rightly served.\n\nI had often become anxious at my husband\'s doings, but had never before been\nashamed; yet now I had to blush for him! I did not know exactly, nor did I\ncare, what wrong poor Noren might, or might not, have done to Miss Gilby, but\nthe idea of sitting in judgement on such a matter at such a time! I should\nhave refused to damp the spirit which prompted young Noren to defy the\nEnglishwoman. I could not but look upon it as a sign of cowardice in my\nhusband, that he should fail to understand this simple thing. And so I blushed\nfor him.\n\nAnd yet it was not that my husband refused to support _Swadeshi_ , or was in\nany way against the Cause. Only he had not been able whole-heartedly to accept\nthe spirit of _Bande Mataram_.  10\n\n"I am willing," he said, "to serve my country; but my worship I reserve for\nRight which is far greater than my country. To worship my country as a god is\nto bring a curse upon it."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[8](hw03.htm#fr_7) The Nationalist movement, which began more as an economic\nthan a political one, having as its main object the encouragement of\nindigenous industries [Trans.].\n\n[9](hw03.htm#fr_8) "Babu" is a term of respect, like "Father" or "Mister," but\nhas also meant in colonial days a person who understands some English.
