Man formed of uterine blood and virile seed proceeds from his mother and\nhis father (as an effect) from its cause. 1\n\n2\\. (Therefore) the father and the mother have power to give, to sell, and to\nabandon their (son).\n\n3\\. But let him not give or receive (in adoption) an only son; 3\n\n4\\. For he (must remain) to continue the line of the ancestors. 4\n\n5\\. Let a woman neither give nor receive a son except with her husband's\npermission. 5\n\n6\\. He who desires to adopt a son, shall assemble 6\n\np. 76\n\nhis kinsmen, announce his intention to the king, make burnt-offerings in the\nmiddle of the house, reciting the Vyah _ri_ tis, and take (as a son) a not\nremote kinsman, just the nearest among his relatives.\n\n7\\. But if a doubt arises (with respect to an adopted son who is) a remote\nkinsman, (the adopter) shall set him apart like a _S_ udra. 7\n\n8\\. For it is declared in the Veda, 'Through one he saves many.' 8\n\n9\\. If, after an adoption has been made, a legitimate son be born, (the\nadopted son) shall obtain a fourth part, 9\n\n10\\. Provided he be not engaged in (rites) procuring prosperity. 10\n\np. 77\n\n11\\. He who divulges the Veda (to persons not authorised to study it), he who\nsacrifices for _S_ udras, (and all those) who have fallen from the rank of the\nhighest caste (shall be excommunicated by the ceremony of) emptying the water-\nvessel. 11\n\n12\\. A slave or the son of a wife of a lower caste, or a relative not\nbelonging to the same caste, who is destitute of good qualities, shall fetch a\nbroken pot from a heap of vessels unfit for use, place Ku _s_ a grass, the\ntops of which have been cut off, or Lohita grass (on the ground), and empty\nthe pot for the (outcast, overturning it) with his left foot; 12\n\n13\\. And the relatives of the (outcast), allowing their hair to hang down,\nshall touch him who empties (the pot). 13\n\n14\\. Turning (when they leave) their left hands towards (that spot), they may\ngo home at pleasure. 14\n\n15\\. Let them not afterwards admit the (excommunicated person) to sacred\nrites. 15\n\n16\\. Those who admit him to sacred rites become his equals.\n\n17\\. But outcasts who have performed (the prescribed) penance (may be)\nreadmitted.\n\n18\\. Now they quote also (the following verse):\n\np. 78\n\n[paragraph continues] 'Let him walk before those who readmit him, like one\ngamboling and laughing. Let him walk behind those who excommunicate him, like\none weeping and sorrowing.'\n\n19\\. Those who strike their teacher, their mother, or their father may be\nreadmitted in the following manner, either after being pardoned by the\n(persons offended) or after expiating their sin.\n\n20\\. Having filled a golden or an earthen vessel (with water taken) from a\nsacred lake or river, they pour (the water) over him, (reciting the three\nverses) 'Ye waters are' &c. 20\n\n21\\. All the (other ceremonies to be performed on the) readmission of one who\nhas bathed (in this manner) have been explained by (those ordained an) the\nbirth of a son. 21\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[75:1](sbe1418.htm#fr_445)-9. **XV**.

See also above, III, 71, and Gautama XI, 17. According to\nK _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita the estate is in this case to be divided equally\nbetween the legitimate son and the adopted son. An entirely p. 77 different\nexplanation, 'Provided (the estate) may not have been expended in acts of\nmerit,' is given Dattaka _k_ andrika V, 17-18. It is doubtlessly erroneous,\nfor 'the estate' is nowhere mentioned in the preceding Sutras.\n\n[77:11](sbe1418.htm#fr_454) Gautama XX, 1.\n\n[77:12](sbe1418.htm#fr_455) Gautama XX, 4.

I read 'pu _n_ yahradat,'\ninstead of 'pur _n_ ahradat,' as the MSS. and K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita\nhave. The passage of the Veda referred to occurs Rig-veda X, 9, I.\n\n[78:21](sbe1418.htm#fr_460) I.e. the person readmitted shall receive all the\nvarious sacraments just like a new-born child.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XVI](sbe1419.htm)\n\n"
