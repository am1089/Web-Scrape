 \nNever, O King--of this be sure--  \nWill Raghu's fiery sons endure,  \nTerrific in their vengeful rage,  \nThis insult to their hermitage.  \nThy guilty hands this day have done  \nA deed which all reprove and shun,  \nUnworthly of a noble chief,  \nThe pillage loved by coward thief.  \nStay, if thy heart allow thee, stay  \nAnd meet me in the deadly fray.  \nSoon shall thou stain the earth with gore,  \nAnd fall as Khara fell before.  \nThe fruits of former deeds o'erpower  \nThe sinner in his dying hour:  \nAnd such a fate on thee, O King,  \nThy tyranny and madness bring.  \nNot e'en the Self-existent Lord,  \nWho reigns by all the worlds adored,  \nWould dare attempt a guilty deed  \nWhich the dire fruits of crime succeed.'  \n   Thus brave Jatayus, best of birds,  \nAddressed the fiend with moving words,  \nThen ready for the swift attack  \nSwooped down upon the giant's back.  \nDown to the bone the talons went  \nWith many a wound the flesh was rent:  \nSuch blows infuriate drivers deal  \nTheir elephants with pointed steel.  \nFixed in his back the strong beak lay,  \nThe talons stripped the flesh away.  \nHe fought with claws and beak and wing.  \nAnd tore the long hair of the king.  \nStill as the royal vulture beat  \nThe giant with his wings and feet,  \nSwelled the fiend's lips, his body shook  \nWith furious rage too great to brook.  \nAbout the Maithil dame he cast  \nOne huge left aim and held her fast.  \nIn furious rage to frenzy fanned  \nHe struck the vulture with his hand.  \nJatayus mocked the vain assay,  \nAnd rent his ten left arms away.  \nDown dropped the severed limbs: anew  \nTen others from his body grew:  \nThus bright with pearly radiance glide  \nDread serpents from the hillock side,  \nAgain in wrath the giant pressed  \nThe lady closer to his breast,  \nAnd foot and fist sent blow on blow  \nIn ceaseless fury at the foe.  \nSo fierce and dire the battle, waged  \nBetween those mighty champions, raged;  \nHere was the lord of giants, there  \nThe noblest of the birds of air.  \nThus, as his love of Rama taught,  \nThe faithful vulture strove and fought.  \nBut Ravan seized his sword and smote  \nHis wings and side and feet and throat.  \nAt mangled side and wing he bled;  \nHe fell, and life was almost fled.  \nThe lady saw her champion lie,  \nHis plumes distained with gory dye,  \nAnd hastened to the vulture's side  \nGrieving as though a kinsman died.  \nThe lord of Lanka's island viewed  \n     The vulture as he lay:  \n   Whose back like some dark cloud was hued,  \n     His breast a paly grey,  \n   Like ashes, when by none renewed.  \n     The flame has died away.  \n   The lady saw with mournful eye,  \n     Her champion press the plain,--  \n   The royal bird, her true ally  \n     Whom Ravan's might had slain.  \n   Her soft arms locked in strict embrace  \n     Around his neck she kept.  \n   And lovely with her moon-bright face  \n     Bent o'er her friend and wept,  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LII.: Ravan's Flight.](ry250.htm)\n\n"
