Eka uddish _t_ o yasmin _s_ raddhe tad\nekoddish _t_ am (Nar.). This is the kind of _S_ raddha sacrifice which is to\nbe performed for one twice-born during the first year after his death; see\nManu III, 247; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 250.\n\n[108:3](sbe29064.htm#fr_238) This rule about the Argha water corresponds to\nthose given with regard to the Parva _n_ a _S_ raddha in the Sutras 3 and 4 of\nthe preceding chapter.\n\n[108:5](sbe29064.htm#fr_239) 'Because the avahana (inviting) is forbidden\nhere, it follows p. 109 that it must take place at the Parva _n_ a _S_ raddha'\n(Nar.). According to Rama _k_ andra's Paddhati he shall say to the Brahma _n_\nas, 'I will invite hither the fathers;' and when they give their consent, he\ninvites them with Rig-veda X, 16, 12. Comp. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 232 seq.,\n&c. Regarding the Vi _s_ ve devas comp. the note on chap. 1, 2; as to the t\n_ri_ ptapra _s_ na (the question whether they are satiated) comp. Manu III,\n251; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 240. At the Parva _n_ a _S_ raddha, after the Brahma _n_\nas have finished their dinner and rinsed their mouths, and after the Pi _n_\n_d_ as have been offered, the sacrificer says, 'May what has been given at\nthis _S_ raddha to our father N.N., who belongs to the gotra N.N., be\nimperishable!' (comp. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 242.) This phrase is to be altered at the\nEkoddish _t_ a _S_ raddha in the way indicated in this Sutra.\n\n[109:8](sbe29064.htm#fr_240) After the Ekoddish _t_ a _S_ raddha has been\nperformed for a dead person during the first year after his death, he is to be\nadmitted, by the Sapi _n_ _d_ ikara _n_ a ceremony, among the other Manes, and\nreceives thenceforward his Pi _n_ _d_ a together with them at the ordinary\nParva _n_ a _S_ raddha. As the ritual of this _S_ raddha requires that the\nnumber of the 'fathers' worshipped should be three, the accession of a new\nperson makes necessary the omission of the pra-pra-pitamaha, who has now\nbecome fourth among the fathers.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV. 3](sbe29065.htm)\n\n"
