If it be said (that the two cases are not parallel), on account of the\nspecialisation of abode (present in the case of the sandal-ointment, absent in\nthe case of the soul); we deny that, on account of the acknowledgment (by\nscripture, of a special place of the soul), viz. within the heart.\n\np. 39\n\nHere it may be objected that the argumentation relied upon in the last Sutra\nis not admissible, because the two cases compared are not parallel. If it were\na settled matter that the soul dwells in one point of the body, the drop of\nsandal-ointment might be adduced as a parallel instance. But, as a matter of\nfact, we know from perception that the drop of sandal-ointment is in contact\nwith one spot of the body only, just as we know that it refreshes the whole\nbody; while in the case of the soul observation tells us only that it is\npercipient all over the body, but not that it abides in one spot.--Should it\nbe said that the latter point must be settled by inference, we reply that\ninference is here of no use, because it is not capable of removing the doubt\nwhether the perception extending over the whole body belongs to a soul which\nextends over the whole body like the skin and the sense of touch inhering in\nit, or to a soul which is all-pervading like ether, or to a soul which, like a\ndrop of ointment, is minute and abides in one spot only 1.\n\nThis objection, the purvapakshin replies, is unfounded 'on account of the\nacknowledgment of a speciality of abode,' an abiding in one spot of the body\nbeing admitted in the case of the soul no less than in the case of a drop of\nointment. For we read in the Vedanta-texts that the soul abides within the\nheart; cp. for instance, the information given (in Pr. Up. III, 6),'The Self\nis in the heart;' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 3, 3), 'That Self abides in the heart;' (B\n_ri_. Up. IV, 3, 7), 'Who is that Self?--He who is within the heart,\nsurrounded by the Pra _n_ as, the person of light, consisting of knowledge.'--\nAs therefore the two cases compared are not devoid of parallelism, the\nargumentation resorted to in Sutra 23 is unobjectionable.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[39:1](sbe38025.htm#fr_25) We cannot reason as follows, 'The soul is atomic\nbecause it produces effects extending (over the whole body), like a drop of\nsandal-ointment;' for that reasoning would apply to the sense of touch (the\nskin) also, which we know not to be of atomic size.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 25](sbe38026.htm)\n\n"
