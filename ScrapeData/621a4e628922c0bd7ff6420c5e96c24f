FIRST BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n#### THE SATARUDRIYA.\n\nTHIS solemn and awful ceremony consists of 425 oblations to Rudra, the\nrepresentative of the fearful aspects of life and nature, accompanied by\nappropriate formulas addressed to the various forms of the terrible god, and\nhis associates, with a view to appeasing their wrath. These formulas make up a\ncomplete ka _n_ _d_ a (XVI) of the Va _g_ asaneyi-sa _m_ hita, and constitute\na special Upanishad. Though only a few of the formulas are actually referred\nto in the text of the Brahma _n_ a, the different portions of which this\ndismal litany consists are otherwise alluded to, and for this reason, as well\nas on account of its intrinsic interest, as doubtless reflecting, to a\nconsiderable extent, the popular belief in demoniac agencies to which man is\nconstantly exposed, a complete translation of the _S_ atarudriya formulas is\nhere given. For a German translation of the Taittiriya recension of the text,\nwith the various readings of the Ka _th_ aka and Va _g_ asaneyin versions, see\nA. Weber, Ind. Stud. II, p. 14 seqq.\n\nI. 1. Reverence, O Rudra, be to thy wrath; and to thine arrow be reverence;\nand to both thine arms be reverence! 2. What auspicious form there is of\nthine, free from terror and boding of evil, with that most propitious form\nlook down upon us, O mountain-dweller! 3. The shaft thou bearest in thy hand\nto hurl, O mountain-dweller, make it harmless, O protector of mountains,\ninjure not man nor beast! 4. With auspicious speech we call upon thee, O\nmountain-dweller, that all these living beings of ours may\n\np. 151\n\nbe healthy and of good cheer! 5. May he plead for us as our intercessor, the\nfirst divine physician: crushing all serpents, turn thou aside all practices\nof witchcraft! 6. That tawny one, and the ruddy and the brown one, the\nauspicious--the Rudras that hover around him by thousands in the quarters:\ntheir wrath do we deprecate. 7. That one who glideth downwards (the sun)\nblood-red and blue-necked--the cowherds have seen him and the water-bearers\n(f. the clouds) have seen him--be he gracious unto us, when seen! 8. Reverence\nbe to the blue-necked, thousand-eyed showerer; and what henchmen there are of\nhis, to them do I render homage. 9. Loose thou the string from the ends of thy\nbow; and cast away the arrows in thy hand, O holy one! 10. Stringless be the\nbow of the coil-braided one, and arrowless his quiver! may his arrows be\nfutile, axed empty his scabbard! 11. With that plague-repelling weapon in thy\nhand, with thy bow, protect us, O best of showerers, on all sides! 12. May the\nshaft of thy bow spare us on all sides, and far from us lay down that quiver\nof thine! 13. Unstringing the bow, and breaking off the points of thy shafts,\nbe thou gracious and well-disposed unto us, O thousand-eyed lord of a hundred\nquivers! 14. Reverence be to thine unstrung weapon, the powerful one; and\nreverence be to thine arms and to thy bow! 15. Neither our full-grown, nor our\nlittle one, neither the virile, nor the unborn, neither our father strike\nthou, nor our mother: harm not our dear bodies, O Rudra! 16. Neither to our\nchildren, and our children's children, nor to our life, neither to our kine\nnor to our horses do thou injury! smite not our shining warriors: with\noffering we ever invoke thee, O Rudra!\n\nII. 17.

Reverence be\nto gatherings, and to ye, lords of the gathering, be reverence! reverence be\nto horses, and to ye, masters of horses, be reverence! reverence be to the\nvictorious (armies), and to ye that smite be reverence! reverence be to the\nserried (hosts), and to ye that crush be reverence! 25.

Reverence be to\nthe propitious one, and to the lord of beasts! reverence be to the terrible\nand fearful one! reverence be to the near-hitter and the far-hitter! reverence\nbe to the slayer and the slaughterer! reverence be to the gold-haired trees!\nreverence be to the deliverer!\n\nVII. 41. Reverence be to the gentle and the friendly one! reverence be to the\npeaceful and pleasing one! reverence be to the kindly and the kindliest!\n\nVIII. 42. Reverence be to him who is on the further shore, and to him on the\nnear shore! reverence be to him who ferrieth over, and to him who bringeth\nashore! reverence be to him dwelling in the ford, and to him on the bank!\nreverence be to him dwelling in the sward, and to him in the foam! 43.\nReverence be to him dwelling in the sand, and to him in the current! reverence\nbe to him dwelling in the stony and to him in habitable places! reverence be\nto the coil-haired and to the straight-haired (?) one! reverence be to him\ndwelling in barren land, and to him on the beaten track! 44. Reverence be to\nhim dwelling in the cow-pen, and to him in the cattle-shed! reverence be to\nhim dwelling in the couch, and to him in the house! reverence be to him\ndwelling in the heart, and to him in the whirlpool! reverence be to him\ndwelling in the well, and to him in the abyss! 45. Reverence be to him\ndwelling in what is dried up, and to him in what is green! reverence be to him\ndwelling in the dust, and to him in the mist! reverence be to him dwelling in\nthe copse, and to him in the shrub! reverence be to him in the ground, and to\nhim in the gully! 46. Reverence be to him dwelling in the leaf, and to him in\nthe leaf-fall (sere leaf)! reverence be to the growler, and to the smiter!\nreverence be to the snatcher, and to the repeller (?)! reverence be to the\narrow-makers, and to ye bow-makers!--Reverence be to ye, the sparkling hearts\nof the gods! reverence be to the discriminating, reverence to the destructive,\nreverence to the irremovable!\n\nIX. 47. Chaser, lord of the (Soma) plant! blue-red cleaver! fright and hurt\nnot these people and these cattle: let none of us sicken! 48. These prayers we\nbring before the mighty Rudra, the coil-braided miter of heroes, that there\nmay be safety for the two-footed and the four-footed, and that everything in\nthis village may be healthy and thriving. 49. That friendly form of thine, O\nRudra, friendly and ever healing, friendly and healing to the stricken:\ntherewith be gracious unto us that we may live! 50. May the shaft of Rudra\nspare us, and the ill-will of the violent and malevolent\n\np. 155\n\none: unstring the strong (bow) from (hurting) our patrons, O showerer (of\ngifts), and be gracious unto our children and our children's children! 51. Be\nthou kindly _and_ well-disposed towards us, O kindliest chief of showerers,\nlay down thy weapon on the highest tree, and putting on the hide come and join\nus, bearing the spear! 52. O blood-red scatterer, reverence be unto thee, holy\none, let those thousand shafts of thine lay low another than us! 53. The\nthousandfold thousand shafts of thine arms--turn thou away their heads from\nus, O holy lord! 54. What countless thousands of Rudras there are upon earth,\ntheir bows do we unstring (and cast away) at a thousand leagues. 55. The\nBhavas in this great sea, the air: their bows do we unstring at a thousand\nleagues. 56. The blue-necked, white-throated Rudras seated in the sky: their\nbows do we unstring at a thousand leagues. 57. The blue-necked, white-throated\n_S_ arvas dwelling below the earth: their bows do we unstring at a thousand\nleagues. 58. The grass-green in the trees, the blue-necked, blood-red ones:\ntheir bows do we unstring at a thousand leagues. 59. They who are the chiefs\nof spirits, hairless and coil-braided: their bows do we unstring at a thousand\nleagues. 60. They who are the guardians of roads, food-bearers, life-fighters\n(?): their bows do we unstring at a thousand leagues. 61. They who haunt the\nbathing-places, wielders of spear and sword: their bows do we unstring at a\nthousand leagues. 62. They who strike men at their meals, and in their cups\nthose that drink: their bows do we unstring at a thousand leagues. 63. What\nRudras are scattered over the regions, so many and more: their bows do we\nunstring at a thousand leagues.--64. Reverence be to the Rudras dwelling in\nthe sky, whose arrows the rain is! to them (I stretch) ten (fingers) eastward,\nten southward, ten westward, ten northward, ten upward: to them be reverence!\nmay they be gracious unto us and help us: whomsoever we hate, and whosoever\nhateth us, him we cast into their jaws! 65. Reverence be to the Rudras\ndwelling in the air, whose arrows the wind is! to them (I stretch) ten\n(fingers) eastward, ten southward, ten westward, ten northward, ten upward: to\nthem be reverence! may they be gracious unto us and help us: whomsoever we\nhate, and whosoever hateth us, him we cast into their jaws! 66. Reverence be\nto the Rudras dwelling upon earth, whose arrows food is! to them (I stretch)\nten (fingers) eastward, ten southward, ten westward, ten northward, ten\nupward: to them be reverence! may they be gracious unto us and help us:\nwhomsoever we hate, and whosoever hateth us, him we cast into their jaws!\n\np. 156\n\n9:1:1:11\\. He then performs the _S_ atarudriya offering! This whole Agni has\nnow 1 been completed: he now is the deity Rudra. Upon him the gods bestowed\nthat highest form, immortality. Flaming he there stood longing for food. The\ngods were afraid of him lest he should hurt them.\n\n9:1:1:22\\. They spake, 'Let us gather together food for him: therewith we will\nappease him!' They gathered for him that food, the _S_ antadevatya 2, and\nthereby appeased him; and inasmuch as they thereby appeased ( _s_ am) the god\n(deva), it is called _S_ antadevatya;-- _S_ antadevatya, doubtless, is here\ncalled mystically ' _S_ atarudriya 3,' for the gods love the mystic. And in\nlike manner does this Sacrificer now bestow upon him that highest form,\nimmortality. Flaming he there stands, longing for food. He gathers for him\nthat food, the _S_ antadevatya, and thereby appeases him.\n\n9:1:1:33\\. He offers wild sesamum seeds. He (Agni) grows when he is being\nbuilt up: he grows for (the consumption) of every kind of food. And wild\nsesamum seeds represent both kinds of food, the cultivated as well as the\nwild-growing: inasmuch as they are sesamum seeds they are a cultivated (kind\nof food), and inasmuch as they ripen on unploughed land they are wild-growing;\nhe thus satisfies him with both kinds of food, the cultivated as well as the\nwild-growing.\n\np. 157\n\n9:1:1:44\\. He offers by means of an arka-leaf 1,--the Arka-tree (Calotropis\ngigantea) is food: he thus gratifies him with food.\n\n9:1:1:55\\. He offers on (three) enclosing-stones:--these enclosing-stones are\nthe (three) Agnis; and thus it is over Agni himself that these oblations of\nhis become offered.\n\n9:1:1:66\\. And as to why he performs the _S_ atarudriya offering. When Pra _g_\napati had become disjointed, the deities departed from him. Only one god did\nnot leave him, to wit, Manyu (wrath): extended he remained within. He (Pra _g_\napati) cried, and the tears of him that fell down settled on Manyu. He became\nthe hundred-headed, thousand-eyed, hundred-quivered Rudra. And the other drops\nthat fell down, spread over these worlds in countless numbers, by thousands;\nand inasmuch as they originated from crying (rud), they were called Rudras\n(roarers). That hundred-headed, thousand-eyed, hundred-quivered Rudra, with\nhis bow strung, and his arrow fitted to the string, was inspiring fear, being\nin quest of food. The gods were afraid of him.\n\n9:1:1:77\\. They spake unto Pra _g_ apati 'We are afraid of this one, lest he\nshould hurt us!' He spake, 'Gather food for him, and appease him therewith!'\nThey gathered for him that food, the _S_ atarudriya (offering), and thereby\nappeased him; and inasmuch as they thereby appeased ( _s_ am) the hundred-\nheaded ( _s_ ata _s_ irsha) Rudra, it is called _S_ ata _s_ irsharudra _s_\namaniya,--and _s_ ata _s_ irsharudra _s_ amaniya, doubtless, is what\n\np. 158\n\nthey mystically call _S_ atarudriya, for the gods love the mystic. And in like\nmanner does this (Sacrificer) now gather for him that food, the _S_\natarudriya, and appease him thereby.\n\n9:1:1:88\\. He offers gavedhuka flour; for from the place where that deity lay\ndisjointed, gavedhuka plants (coix barbata) sprang forth: he thus gratifies\nhim by his own portion, by his own life-sap.\n\n9:1:1:99\\. He offers by means of an arka-leaf; for that tree sprang from the\nresting-place of that god: he thus gratifies him by his own portion, by his\nown life-sap.\n\n9:1:1:1010\\. He offers on (three) enclosing-stones 1, for the enclosing-stones\nare the hair, and neither poison nor anything else injures one at the hair. He\noffers whilst standing on the left (north) side of Agni (the altar), with his\nface to the north; for in that region lies the house of that god 2: it is thus\nin his own region that he gratifies him, in his own region he contents him\nwith offering.\n\n9:1:1:1111\\. The first Svaha ('hail') he utters on the knee-high one,---what\nis knee-high is, as it were, below, and below, as it were, is this\n(terrestrial) world: he thus gratifies those Rudras who entered this world.\n\n9:1:1:1212\\. Then on the navel-high one,--what is navel-high\n\np. 159\n\nis, as it were, the middle; and the middle, as it were, is the air-world: he\nthus gratifies those Rudras who entered the air-world.\n\n9:1:1:1313\\. Then on the one reaching up to the mouth,--what reaches up to the\nmouth is, as it were, above, and above, as it were, is yonder world: he thus\ngratifies those Rudras who entered yonder world. [He does so] with Svaha,--the\nSvaha is food: with food he thus gratifies them.\n\n9:1:1:1414\\. [He offers, with, Va _g_. S. XVI, 1], 'Reverence, O Rudra, be to\nthy wrath!' he thereby does reverence to that wrath which remained extended\nwithin him;--'And to thine arrow be reverence, and to both thine arms be\nreverence!' for it was by his arrow and his arms that he was inspiring fear.\n\n9:1:1:1515\\. That god who became the hundred-headed (Rudra) is the chief\n(kshatra 1), and those others who originated from the drops are the peasants\n(clansmen): those peasants in the first place assigned to that chief this as\nhis special share, to wit, this first chapter of formulas 2, and gratified him\nthereby. And in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now assign this to him as\nhis special fore-share, and gratify him thereby. Hence this (section) is\naddressed to a single deity, to Rudra; for it is him he thereby gratifies.\n\n9:1:1:1616\\. There are here fourteen formulas,--thirteen months are a year,\nand Pra _g_ apati is the fourteenth;\n\np. 160\n\nand Pra _g_ apati is Agni: as great as Agni is as great as is his measure,\nwith so much food he thus gratifies him. 'Reverence! reverence!' he\nsays;--reverence being sacrifice, it is by sacrifice, by reverence, that he\nthus reveres him. Therefore he must not mention any one unworthy of sacrifice,\nfor it would be just as if he were to say to him, 'Sacrifice be to thee!'\n\n9:1:1:1717\\. He then makes offering to those forming pairs 1: 'Reverence to so\nand so! reverence to so and so!' It is as if he were to say, 'Thou, N. N., and\nthis one, do not ye two injure us!' for in no wise does a man who is known and\nappealed to 2 injure us.\n\n9:1:1:1818\\. [Va _g_. S. XVI, 17], 'Reverence be to the golden-armed leader of\nhosts, and to the lord of regions be reverence!' for he (Rudra-Agni) is indeed\nthe golden-armed 3 leader of hosts, and the lord of regions. And in that\neverything in this second chapter of formulas applies to one and the same\ndeity, thereby he gratifies that (god Rudra), and makes the chief to have a\nshare in the people (or the clan): hence whatever belongs to the people 4, in\nthat the chieftain has a share. And those (Rudras) that spread over these\nworlds, countless, by thousands 5, they are the deities to whom he now offers.\n\n9:1:1:1919\\. He thus makes offering to the tribes (of Rudras), for it was\nthose tribes, those Rudras, that spread, and wheresoever they are there he\nthereby gratifies them. And thus, indeed, (he gratifies) those tribes of\nRudras; and, men being after the\n\np. 161\n\nmanner of the gods, therefore also these tribes of men: tribe after tribe he\nthus gratifies them.\n\n9:1:1:2020\\. Now some of these (formulas) have 'reverence' on both sides, and\nothers on one side only;--more terrible and more unappeased, indeed, are those\n(Rudras) that have 'reverence' on both sides: on both sides he thereby\nappeases them by sacrifice, by reverence.\n\n9:1:1:2121\\. With (each set of) eighty (formulas) he utters the Svaha 1,--on\nthe first anuvaka, and on eighty, and on eighty; and the formulas which follow\nas far as the 'unstringing'-formulas (Va _g_. S. XVI, 54-63),--eighties 2 mean\nfood: by means of food he thus gratifies them.\n\n9:1:1:2222\\. He thus mutters these formulas (the last four of Va _g_. S. XVI,\n46), 'Reverence be to you, the sparkling (hearts of the gods)!' for this is\nhis favourite resort, either as a dear son or the heart: hence whenever he\nshould be in fear of that god (Rudra), let him offer with those mystic\nutterances, for he draws nigh unto the favourite resort of that god, and so\nthat god does not injure him.\n\n9:1:1:2323\\. 'Reverence be to you, the sparkling 3,'\n\np. 162\n\nfor those (Rudras) produce (kar) everything here,--'hearts of the gods!'--\nAgni, Vayu and \xc3\x82ditya (fire, wind and sun), these truly are the hearts of the\ngods;--'Reverence to the discriminating!'--for those (gods) discriminate\neverything here;--'Reverence to the destructive!'--for those (gods) destroy\nwhom they wish to destroy;--'Reverence to the irremovable!'--for those (gods)\nare not (to be) removed from these worlds.\n\n9:1:1:2424\\. He then mutters those that follow (Va _g_. S. XVI, 47 seq.),\n'Chaser! lord of the (Soma) plant!'--that (god) is indeed a repeller, for he\nchases away whom he wishes to chase away;--'lord of the plant'--that is, 'lord\nof the Soma-plant;'--'O blue-red cleaver 1;'--these are names and forms of\nhim: he thus gratifies him by calling him by his names;--'frighten and hurt\nnot these people and these cattle! let none of us sicken!' as the text, so the\nsense.\n\n9:1:1:2525\\. That god (Rudra) is the kshatra (ruling power; chieftainship or\nchief); and for that chief these peasants set apart this special fore-share,\nto wit, that first section (of formulas); and now he (the Sacrificer) sets\napart for him that after-share, and thereby gratifies him; and hence this\n(section) also belongs to a single deity, to wit, to Rudra; for it is him he\nthereby gratifies.\n\np. 163\n\n9:1:1:2626\\. These are seven formulas,--of seven layers the fire-altar\nconsists, and the year consists of seven months, and Agni is the year: as\ngreat as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much food he thus\ngratifies him. These two kinds (of formulas) amount to twenty-one,--the twelve\nmonths, the five seasons, these three worlds, and yonder sun as the twenty-\nfirst (make up) this amount.\n\n9:1:1:2727\\. He then offers (the libations of the) 'unstringing'-formulas 1.\nFor at that time the gods, having gratified those (Rudras) by that food,\nunstrung their bows by means of these 'unstringing'-formulas; and in like\nmanner this (Sacrificer), having gratified them by that food, now unstrings\ntheir bows by means of these 'unstringing'-formulas; for with an unstrung bow\none injures no one.\n\n9:1:1:2828\\. Here now he says 'at a thousand leagues,' for a thousand leagues\nis the farthest distance; and he thus unstrings their bows at what is the\nfarthest distance.\n\n9:1:1:2929\\. And, again, as to why he says 'at a thousand leagues,'--a\nthousand leagues means this Agni (fire-altar), for neither this way nor that\nway is there any other thing greater than he; and it is when he makes offering\nin the fire that he unstrings their bows at a thousand leagues.\n\n9:1:1:3030\\. 'Countless thousands,--in this great sea,'--thus, wheresover they\nare, there he unstrings their bows.\n\np. 164\n\n9:1:1:3131\\. There are ten of these 'unstringing'-offerings he makes,--the\nVira _g_ consists of ten syllables, and Agni is Vira _g_ (widely-shining or\nruling); there are ten regions, and Agni is the regions; there are ten vital\nairs, and Agni is the vital airs: as great as Agni is, as great as is his\nmeasure, by so much he thus unstrings their bows.\n\n9:1:1:3232\\. He then offers the descending 1 (series of oblations). For then\n(in the preceding oblations) he ascends these worlds upwards from hence: this\nis, as it were, an ascent away from here. But this (earth) is a firm resting-\nplace: the gods returned to this resting-place; and in like manner does the\nSacrificer now return to this resting-place.\n\n9:1:1:3333\\. And, again, as to why he descends. Then (in the preceding\noblations) he goes after those (gods), gratifying (propitiating) them. From\nthence he now recovers his own self unto life; and so does he by that self of\nhis attain all vital power.\n\n9:1:1:3434\\. And., again, as to why he descends. He then (in the preceding\noblations) gratifies those Rudras from hence upwards; he now does so again\nfrom thence hitherwards.\n\n9:1:1:3535\\. [Va _g_. S. XVI 64], 'Reverence be to the Rudras dwelling in the\nsky,'--he thereby does reverence to those Rudras who are in yonder\nworld;--'whose arrows the rain is,' for the rain is\n\np. 165\n\nindeed their arrows, and by the rain they injure whom they wish to injure.\n\n9:1:1:3636\\. [Va _g_. S. XVI, 65], 'Reverence be to the Rudras dwelling in the\nair,'--he thereby does reverence to those Rudras who are in the air;--'whose\narrows the wind is,' for the wind is indeed their arrows, and by the wind they\ninjure whom they wish to injure.\n\n9:1:1:3737\\. [Va _g_. S. XVI, 66], 'Reverence be to the Rudras dwelling upon\nearth,'--he thereby does reverence to those Rudras who are in this\n(terrestrial) world;--'whose arrows food is,' for food is indeed their arrows,\nand by means of food they injure whom they wish to injure.\n\n9:1:1:3838\\. 'To them (I stretch) ten (fingers) forwards, ten to the right,\nten backwards, ten to the left, ten upwards 1,'--of ten syllables consists the\nVira _g_ , and Agni is Vira _g_ ; there are ten seasons, and Agni is the\nseasons; there are ten vital airs, and Agni is the vital airs: as great as\nAgni is, as great as is his measure, with so much food he thus gratifies them.\n\n9:1:1:3939\\. And as to why he says 'ten-ten,'--there are ten fingers in the\njoined hands 2: he thus makes reverence to them in each direction; and hence\nhe who is frightened places his hands together;--'To them be reverence!'--he\nthus does reverence to them;--'May they be gracious unto us!'--they thus are\ngracious unto him;--'whomsoever we hate, and whosoever hateth us, him we cast\ninto their jaws!'--thus he casts into their jaws\n\np. 166\n\nwhomsoever he hates, and whosoever hates him. He may say, 'So-and-so I cast\ninto their jaws!' naming him whom he hates, and then he has no longer any hold\nupon him. But let him take no notice of this (injunction), for indicated of\nhimself is he whom he who knows this hates.\n\n9:1:1:4040\\. In three turns he descends,--Agni is threefold: as great as Agni\nis, as great as is his measure, by so much food he thus gratifies them. With\n'Svaha' (he makes offering), for the Svaha is food: with food he thus\ngratifies them. Thrice (in three turns) he ascends from hence upwards,--that\nmakes six: the significance of this has been explained 1.\n\n9:1:1:4141\\. And as to why he descends in three turns,--it is because he\nascends in three turns: thus in as many turns as he ascends, in so many turns\ndoes he descend.\n\n9:1:1:4242\\. He then throws that arka-leaf 2 into the pit; for it is therewith\nthat he performs that sacrificial work sacred to Rudra, and that same (leaf)\nis inauspicious; he now puts it away, lest any one should tread on this\ninauspicious (leaf), and suffer injury thereby: hence (he throws it) into the\npit. And, again, as to why (he throws it) into the pit,--the pit, doubtless,\nmeans the fire, and thus that fire consumes it. Now as to the (symbolic)\ncorrespondence.\n\n9:1:1:4343\\. As to this they say, 'How does this _S_ atarudriya of his attain\nto (conformity with) the year, and Agni? how does it correspond to the year,\nto\n\np. 167\n\n[paragraph continues] Agni?' Well, this _S_ atarudriya includes three hundred\nand sixty (formulas); and (other) thirty, and thirty-five. Now, as to the\nthree hundred and sixty which there are, so many are there days in the year:\nthereby it obtains the days of the year. And as to the thirty (formulas) which\nthere are, they are the thirty nights of the month: thereby it obtains the\nnights of the month: thus it obtains both the days and nights of the year. And\nas to the thirty-five (formulas) there are, they are the thirteenth month 1,\n(Agni's) self,--the body (consists of) thirty (limbs 2), the feet of two, the\nbreath of two (in-breathing and off-breathing), and the head is the thirty-\nfifth: so much is the year. And in this way this _S_ atarudriya of his attains\nto (conformity with) the year, Agni, and corresponds to the year, Agni. And,\nindeed, in the _S_ a _n_ _d_ ila fire-altar as many bricks with formulas\nattached to them are placed in the middle, for these bricks are indeed the\nsame as these different Agnis (invoked in the _S_ atarudriya); and thus these\nAgnis of his come to have oblations offered to them separately by means of the\n_S_ atarudriya.\n\n9:1:1:4444\\. As to this they say, 'How does this _S_ atarudriya of his attain\nto (conformity with) the Great\n\np. 168\n\n[paragraph continues] Litany 1?--how does it correspond to the Great Litany?'\nWell, those twenty-five formulas which there are on both sides of the eighties\n2, they are the twenty-five-fold body 3; and where the body (of the altar-\nbird) is, that (includes) the head, and the wings and tail. And what eighties\n(of formulas) there are (in the _S_ atarudriya), thereby indeed the\n(corresponding) eighties (of the Mahad uktham) are obtained, for by eighties\nthe Great Litany is recited. And what there is (in the _S_ atarudriya) after\nthe eighties that is for him the same as what there, in the Great Litany, is\nafter the eighties 4; and in this way this _S_ atarudriya\n\np. 169\n\nof his attains to (conformity with) the Great Litany; in this way it\ncorresponds to the Great Litany.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[156:1](sbe4330.htm#fr_261) Or, here, in this (atra), in the shape of this\n(altar) on which the fire is to be deposited.\n\n[156:2](sbe4330.htm#fr_262) That is, that whereby the deity is propitiated or\nappeased.\n\n[156:3](sbe4330.htm#fr_263) A fanciful etymology of _S_ ata-rudriya, as if it\nwere _s_ anta (propitiated) + rudriya, instead of 'that which relates to a\nhundred Rudras'; cf. [paragraph 7](sbe4330.htm#9:1:1:7).\n\n[157:1](sbe4330.htm#fr_264) That is to say, the leaf is used in lieu of the\nordinary offering-spoon. Whilst making continual oblations on one of the three\nstones from this leaf, held in his right hand, the priest holds a piece of\narka wood in his left hand. Mahidh. on Va _g_. S. XVI, 1.\n\n[158:1](sbe4330.htm#fr_265) The site of the altar is enclosed within a\ncontinuous line of 261 pari _s_ rits, about half a foot in width, running\nalong its edge. Their height is indeterminate, with the exception of three of\nthem, dug in at the back (west) corner of the left wing, of which one is to\nreach up to the knee, the second up to the navel, and the third up to the\nmouth; each of the latter two standing to the left (north) of the preceding\none.\n\n[158:2](sbe4330.htm#fr_266) See I, 7, 3, 20, with note. Agni, in the form of\nthe formidable Rudra (who is to be kept at a distance), is referred to.\n\n[159:1](sbe4330.htm#fr_267) Literally, the ruling power.\n\n[159:2](sbe4330.htm#fr_268) The first anuvaka of ka _n_ _d_ a XVI of the Va\n_g_. S. consists of sixteen verses; which of these the fourteen referred to in\nthe next paragraph are is not clear to me.\n\n[160:1](sbe4330.htm#fr_269) That is from Va _g_. S. XVI, 17 seqq.\n\n[160:2](sbe4330.htm#fr_270) Or, who is appealed to as being known to us, i.e.\nin terms showing that he is known to us.\n\n[160:3](sbe4330.htm#fr_271) That is, aureis brachiis instructus.\n\n[160:4](sbe4330.htm#fr_272) Pra _g_ aya yad dhanam asti, Say.\n\n[160:5](sbe4330.htm#fr_273) See [paragraph 28](sbe4330.htm#9:1:1:28).\n\n[161:1](sbe4330.htm#fr_274) The calculation here, as so often in regard to\nmetres, is rather a loose one. Anuvaka I, consisting of sixteen verses, is\ntaken as amounting to the first fourscore formulas; anuvakas II and III,\nconsisting of ten ka _n_ _d_ ikas (each of which is calculated to consist of\neight mantras), constitute the second fourscore; anuvakas IV and V again form\nthe third fourscore; anuvakas VI-VIII (save the last four formulas, see\n[parag. 22](sbe4330.htm#9:1:1:22)), the fourth fourscore; and from there to\nthe 'unstringing'-formulas, that is, from within XVI, 46 to 53, the fifth\nfourscore. At the end of each eighty formulas he is to utter one Svaha (sak\n_ri_ t svahakara _h_ , Say.).\n\n[161:2](sbe4330.htm#fr_275) An etymological play on the word 'a _s_ iti,' as\nif derived from a _s_ , to eat.\n\n[161:3](sbe4330.htm#fr_276) ? Or, scatterers, sprinklers (kirika), root k _r\ni_. The author of the p. 162 Brahma _n_ a, on the other hand, evidently takes\nit in the sense of 'maker, producer.'\n\n[162:1](sbe4330.htm#fr_277) Thus ('Zerspalter') daridra is probably correctly\ninterpreted (from root 'dar,' to split) by Prof. Weber; whilst the\ncommentators take it in its ordinary sense of 'poor' (i.e. without an\nassistant, Mahidh.); blue-red Rudra is called inasmuch as he is the 'nilaka\n_n_ _th_ a' blue-necked, and red all over the rest of his body.\n\n[163:1](sbe4330.htm#fr_278) Viz. Va _g_. S. XVI, 54-63: 'What countless\nthousands of Rudras there are upon earth, their bows do we unstring at a\nthousand leagues.--The Bhavas that are in this great sea, in the air, their\nbow do we unstring at a thousand leagues.' Thus each formula ends with the\n'unstringing' refrain.\n\n[164:1](sbe4330.htm#fr_279) Va _g_. S. XVI, 64-66. In making these three\noblations to the Rudras in the sky, the air, and on earth respectively, the\nprocedure is the reverse from that described in [paragraphs\n11](sbe4330.htm#9:1:1:11)-[13](sbe4330.htm#9:1:1:13), viz. first on the\nenclosing-stone which reaches up to his mouth, then on that reaching up to his\nnavel, and lastly on that reaching up to his knee.\n\n[165:1](sbe4330.htm#fr_280) These words, as well as the spaced words in the\nnext paragraph, are added to each of the three formulas in [paragraphs\n35](sbe4330.htm#9:1:1:35)-[37](sbe4330.htm#9:1:1:37).\n\n[165:2](sbe4330.htm#fr_281) The joining of the hollow of the hands, by placing\nthe tips of the fingers together, is a sign of reverence.\n\n[166:1](sbe4330.htm#fr_282) Of objects numbering six, the seasons commonly\noccur, e. g. VI, 7, 1, 16.\n\n[166:2](sbe4330.htm#fr_283) See [paragraph 4](sbe4330.htm#9:1:1:4). According\nto Katy. _S_ rautas. 18, 1, 6 both offering-utensils (the arka-leaf and the\narka-stick) are thrown into the pit.\n\n[167:1](sbe4330.htm#fr_284) As Prof. Weber, 'Die vedischen Nachrichten von den\nNakshatra,' p. 298, points out, this passage points to a six years' period of\nintercalation, since, in counting 360 days in the year, the remainder\naccumulates in six years to an intercalary month of thirty-five days (or\nthirty-six according to Sat. Br. X, 5, 4, 5); and accordingly in Va _g_. S.\nXXX, 15, and Taitt. \xc3\x82r. IV, 19, 1, the names of the six years of such a period\nof intercalation are mentioned; while a five years' period and the names of\nthe respective years are more frequently referred to.\n\n[167:2](sbe4330.htm#fr_285) Viz. twenty fingers and toes, the upper and lower\narms, the thighs and shanks, and the hands.\n\n[168:1](sbe4330.htm#fr_286) For the mahad uktham, or Great Litany, recited on\nthe Mahavrata day, see [p. 110](sbe4324.htm#page_110), note\n[3](sbe4324.htm#fn_202). According to Saya _n_ a, however, this does not refer\nto the Mahad uktham, or Great Litany, itself, but to its Stotra, the\nMahavrata-saman (cf. note on [X, 1, 1, 5](sbe4345.htm#10:1:1:5)), by the\nchanting of which it is preceded, and which, like the Great Litany itself, is\nrepresented as being composed of the different parts of Agni-Pra _g_ apati's\nbird-shaped body. Now, that part of the chant which corresponds to the god's\ntrunk (atman) is the only part of this Stotra which is chanted in the Pa _\xc3\xb1_\n_k_ avi _m_ _s_ astoma, or twenty-five-versed hymn-form, which, indeed, is the\ncharacteristic Stoma of the Mahavrata day, all other Stotras of that rite\nbeing chanted in that form. It is, however, doubtful to me whether it is not\nrather the opening part of the Great Litany itself representing the trunk that\nis here referred to, and which, indeed, consists of twenty-five verses; cf. F.\nMax Muller, Upanishads, I, p. 183. Besides, it has always to be borne in mind\nthat the particular arrangement of the Great Litany which the authors of the\nBrahma _n_ a had before them, may have differed in some respects from those\nknown to us.\n\n[168:2](sbe4330.htm#fr_287) See [p. 112](sbe4324.htm#page_112), note\n[1](sbe4324.htm#fn_204).\n\n[168:3](sbe4330.htm#fr_288) That is, the body with its twenty-four limbs, viz.\nthe two arms, two legs, and the twenty fingers and toes.\n\n[168:4](sbe4330.htm#fr_289) According to Saya _n_ a, the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ avi _m_\n_s_ a-stotra, chanted after the Mahad uktham, is here referred to. See [p.\n111](sbe4324.htm#page_111), note [1](sbe4324.htm#fn_203). Saya _n_ a takes it\nto refer to the prose-formulas at the end of the Sastra, which, he says,\nrepresent the mind (buddhi) of Pra _g_ apati.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IX, 1, 2.
