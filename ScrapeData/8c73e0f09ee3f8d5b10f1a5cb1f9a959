And what is called the Adhibhuta? And who is the Adhiya _g_ \xc3\xb1a, and\nhow in this body, O destroyer of Madhu? And how, too, are you to be known at\nthe time of departure (from this world) by those who restrain their selfs?\n\nThe Deity said:\n\nThe Brahman is the supreme, the indestructible. Its manifestation (as an\nindividual self) is called the Adhyatma. The offering (of an oblation to any\ndivinity), which is the cause of the production and development of all things,\nis named action. The Adhibhuta is all perishable things. The Adhidaivata is\nthe (primal) being. And the Adhiya _g_ \xc3\xb1a, O best of embodied (beings)! is I\nmyself in this body 4.\n\np. 78\n\n[paragraph continues] And he who leaves this body and departs (from this\nworld) remembering me in (his) last moments, comes into my essence. There is\nno doubt of that. Also whichever form 1 (of deity) he remembers when he\nfinally leaves this body, to that he goes, O son of Kunti! having been used to\nponder on it. Therefore, at all times remember me, and engage in battle.\nFixing your mind and understanding on me, you will come to me, there is no\ndoubt. He who thinks of the supreme divine Being, O son of P _ri_ tha! with a\nmind not (running) to other (objects), and possessed of abstraction in the\nshape of continuous meditation (about the supreme), goes to him. He who,\npossessed of reverence (for the supreme Being) with a steady mind, and with\nthe power of devotion, properly concentrates the life-breath between the brows\n2, and meditates on the ancient Seer, the ruler, more minute than the minutest\natom 3, the supporter of all, who is of an unthinkable form, whose brilliance\nis like that of the sun, and who is beyond all darkness 4, he attains to that\ntranscendent and divine Being. I 5 will tell you briefly about the seat, which\nthose who know the Vedas declare to be indestructible; which entered by\nascetics from whom all desires have departed; and wishing for which, people\npursue the\n\np. 79\n\nmode of life of Brahma _k_ arins 1. He who leaves the body and departs (from\nthis world), stopping up all passages 2, and confining the mind within the\nheart 3, placing the life-breath in the head, and adhering to uninterrupted\nmeditation 4, repeating the single syllable 'Om,' (signifying) the eternal\nBrahman 5, and meditating on me, he reaches the highest goal. To the devotee\nwho constantly practises abstraction, O son of P _ri_ tha! and who with a mind\nnot (turned) to anything else, is ever and constantly meditating on me, I am\neasy of access. The high-souled ones, who achieve the highest perfection,\nattaining to me, do not again come to life, which is transient, a home of woes\n6. All worlds, O Ar _g_ una! up to the world of Brahman, are (destined) to\nreturn 7. But, O son of Kunti! after attaining to me, there is no birth again.\nThose who know a day of Brahman to end after one thousand ages, and the night\nto terminate after one thousand ages, are the persons\n\np. 80\n\nwho know day and night 1. On the advent of day, all perceptible things are\nproduced from the unperceived; and on the advent of night they dissolve in\nthat same (principle) called the unperceived. This same assemblage of\nentities, being produced again and again, dissolves on the advent of night,\nand, O son of P _ri_ tha! issues forth on the advent of day, without a will of\nits own 2. But there is another entity, unperceived and eternal, and distinct\nfrom this unperceived (principle), which is not destroyed when all entities\nare destroyed. It is called the unperceived, the indestructible; they call it\nthe highest goal. Attaining to it, none returns 3. That is my supreme abode.\nThat supreme Being, O son of P _ri_ tha! he in whom all these entities dwell\n4, and by whom all this is permeated, is to be attained to by reverence not\n(directed) to another. I will state the times, O descendant of Bharata! at\nwhich devotees departing (from this world) go, never to return, or to return.\nThe fire, the flame 5, the day,\n\np. 81\n\nthe bright fortnight, the six months of the northern solstice, departing (from\nthe world) in these, those who know the Brahman go to the Brahman. Smoke,\nnight, the dark fortnight, the six months of the southern solstice, (dying) in\nthese, the devotee goes to the lunar light and returns\n[1](sbe0811.htm#fn_309). These two paths, bright and dark, are deemed to be\neternal in this world [2](sbe0811.htm#fn_310). By the one, (a man) goes never\nto return, by the other he comes back. Knowing these two paths, O son of P\n_ri_ tha! no devotee is deluded [3](sbe0811.htm#fn_311). Therefore at all\ntimes be possessed of devotion, O Ar _g_ una! A devotee knowing all this\n[4](sbe0811.htm#fn_312), obtains all the holy fruit which is prescribed for\n(study of) the Vedas, for sacrifices, and also for penances and gifts, and he\nattains to the highest and primeval seat.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[77:1](sbe0809.htm#fr_289) Concerning the supreme principle and the mode of\nworshipping it.\n\n[77:2](sbe0809.htm#fr_290) Cf. infra, [p. 109](sbe0816.htm#page_109).\n\n[77:3](sbe0809.htm#fr_291) See the next chapter.\n\n[77:4](sbe0810.htm#fr_292) Adhyatma where it occurs before (e. g. [p.\n55](sbe0805.htm#page_55)) has been rendered 'the relation between the supreme\nand individual soul.' As to p. 78 action, cf. pp. [53](sbe0805.htm#page_53),\n[54](sbe0805.htm#page_54). Adhibhuta is apparently the whole inanimate\ncreation, and Adhidaivata is the being supposed to dwell in the sun. Adhiya\n_g_ \xc3\xb1a is K _ri_ sh _n_ a. Cf. too pp. [113](sbe0817.htm#page_113),\n[114](sbe0817.htm#page_114).\n\n[78:1](sbe0810.htm#fr_293) Some commentators say 'whatever thing' generally.\nThe 'form' remembered in one's last moments would be that which had been most\noften meditated on during life.\n\n[78:2](sbe0810.htm#fr_294) Cf. supra, [p. 67](sbe0807.htm#page_67).\n\n[78:3](sbe0810.htm#fr_295) Ka _th_ a, p. 105; _S_ veta _s_ vatara, p. 333.\n\n[78:4](sbe0810.htm#fr_296) Cf. _S_ veta _s_ vatara-upanishad, p. 327.\n\n[78:5](sbe0810.htm#fr_297) Kathopanishad, p. 102.\n\n[79:1](sbe0810.htm#fr_298) As to Brahma _k_ arins, see supra, [p.\n69](sbe0808.htm#page_69).\n\n[79:2](sbe0810.htm#fr_299) 'The senses,' say the commentators. Might it not\nrefer to the 'nine portals' at [p. 65](sbe0807.htm#page_65) supra? See also,\nhowever, [p. 108](sbe0816.htm#page_108).\n\n[79:3](sbe0810.htm#fr_300) I. e. thinking of nothing, making the mind cease to\nwork. Cf. Maitri-upanishad, p. 179.\n\n[79:4](sbe0810.htm#fr_301) Cf. Maitri-upanishad, p. 130, uninterrupted, like\n'oil when poured out,' says the commentator.\n\n[79:5](sbe0810.htm#fr_302) Cf. _Kh_ andogya-upanishad, p. 151; Mandukya, pp.\n330-388 (Om is all-past, present, and future); N _ri_ si _m_ ha Tapini, pp.\n110, 117, 171; Maitri, p. 140; Pra _s_ na, p. 220. On the opening passage of\nthe _Kh_ andogya, _S_ a _n_ kara says, 'Om is the closest designation of the\nsupreme Being. He is pleased when it is pronounced, as people are at the\nmention of a favourite name.' See also Max Muller, Hibbert Lectures, p. 84;\nGoldstucker's Remains, I, 122.\n\n[79:6](sbe0810.htm#fr_303) See infra, [p. 86](sbe0811.htm#page_86); and cf.\nSutta Nipata, p. 125.\n\n[79:7](sbe0810.htm#fr_304) They are only temporary, not the everlasting seats\nof the soul.\n\n[80:1](sbe0810.htm#fr_305) Cf. Manu I, 73. _S_ a _n_ kara says, that this\nexplains why the abodes of Brahma and others are said to be not lasting. They\nare limited by time. As to ages, _S_ ridhara says, a human year is a day and\nnight of the gods. Twelve thousand years made of such days and nights make up\nthe four ages: one thousand such, 'quaternions of ages' make up a day, and\nanother thousand a night of Brahma. Of such days and nights Brahma has a\nhundred years to live. At the close of his life, the universe is destroyed.\n\n[80:2](sbe0810.htm#fr_306) Cf. [p. 82](sbe0811.htm#page_82) infra; also Manu-\nsm _ri_ ti I, 52; and Kalidasa's Kumarasambhava II, 8.\n\n[80:3](sbe0810.htm#fr_307) Cf. Ka _th_ opanishad, p. 149; and also [p.\n112](sbe0817.htm#page_112) infra.\n\n[80:4](sbe0810.htm#fr_308) I. e. by whom, as the cause of them, all these\nentities are supported; cf. [p. 82](sbe0811.htm#page_82) infra.\n\n[80:5](sbe0810.htm#fr_309) _S_ ridhara understands 'the time when,' in the\nsentence preceding this, to mean the path indicated by a deity presiding over\np. 81 time, by which;' and the fire-flame as included in this, though having\nno connexion with time. _S_ a _n_ kara agrees, though he also suggests that\nfire means a deity presiding over time. I own I have no clear notion of the\nmeaning of these verses. Cf. _Kh_ andogya, p. 342; B _ri_ had-ara _ny_ aka-\nupanishad, p. 1057 seq.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter IX](sbe0811.htm)\n\n"
