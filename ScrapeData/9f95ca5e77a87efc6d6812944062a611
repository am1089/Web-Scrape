Should it be said that (it is) not, on account of the observation of\nemployment; we say, not so; for as in the case of milk.\n\nWe have so far determined that it is in no way unreasonable to hold that the\nhighest Brahman, which is all-knowing, capable of realising its purposes, &c.,\nhas all beings, sentient and non-sentient, for its body, and hence constitutes\nthe Self of all and differs in nature from everything else. We now proceed to\nshow that it is not unreasonable to hold that, possessing all those\nattributes, it is able to effect by its mere will and wish the creation of\nthis entire manifold Universe.--But, it may here be said, it is certainly a\nmatter of observation that agents of limited power are obliged to employ a\nnumber of instrumental agencies in order to effect their purposes; but how\nshould it follow therefrom that the view of the all-powerful Brahman producing\nthe world without such instrumental agencies is in any way irrational?--As, we\nreply, it is observed in ordinary life that even such agents as possess the\ncapability of producing certain effects stand in need of certain instruments,\nsome slow-witted person may possibly imagine that Brahman, being destitute of\nall such instruments, is incapable of creating the world. It is this doubt\nwhich we have to dispel. It is seen that potters, weavers, &c., who produce\njars, cloth, and the like, are incapable of actually producing unless they\nmake use of certain implements, although they may fully\n\np. 472\n\npossess the specially required skill. Men destitute of such skill are not\ncapable of production, even with the help of implements; those having the\ncapacity produce by means of the instruments only. This leads to the\nconclusion that Brahman also, although possessing all imaginable powers, is\nnot capable of creating the world without employing the required instrumental\nagencies. But before creation there existed nothing that could have assisted\nhim, as we know from texts such as 'Being only this was in the beginning';\n'there was Naraya _n_ a alone.' Brahman's creative agency thus cannot be\nrendered plausible; and hence the prima facie view set forth in the earlier\npart of the Sutra, 'Should it be said that (it is) not; on account of the\nobservation of employment (of instruments).'\n\nThis view is set aside by the latter part of the Sutra, 'not so; for as in the\ncase of milk.' It is by no means a fact that every agent capable of producing\na certain effect stands in need of instruments. Milk, e.g. and water, which\nhave the power of producing certain effects, viz. sour milk and ice\nrespectively, produce these effects unaided. Analogously Brahman also, which\npossesses the capacity of producing everything, may actually do so without\nusing instrumental aids. The 'for' in the Sutra is meant to point out the fact\nthat the proving instances are generally known, and thus to indicate the\nsilliness of the objection. Whey and similar ingredients are indeed sometimes\nmixed with milk, but not to the end of making the milk turn sour, but merely\nin order to accelerate the process and give to the sour milk a certain\nflavour.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 25.
