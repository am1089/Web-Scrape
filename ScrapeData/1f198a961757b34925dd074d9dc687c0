XXXVI.\n\nThe Asura Dwivida, in the form of an ape, destroyed by Balarama.\n\nHEAR also, Maitreya, another exploit performed by the mighty Balarama. The\ngreat Asura, the foe of the friends of the gods, Naraka, had a friend of\nexceeding prowess in the monkey named Dwivida, who was animated by implacable\nhostility against the deities, and vowed to revenge on the whole of them the\ndestruction of Naraka by Krishn\xcc\x81a, at the instigation of the king of the\ncelestials, by preventing sacrifices, and effecting the annihilation of the\nmortal sphere. Blinded by ignorance, he accordingly interrupted all religious\nrites, subverted all righteous observances, and occasioned the death of living\nbeings: he set fire to the forests, to villages, and to towns: sometimes he\noverwhelmed cities and hamlets with falling rocks; or lifting up mountains in\nthe waters, he cast them into the ocean: then taking his place amidst the\ndeep, he agitated the waves, until the foaming sea rose above its confines,\nand swept away the villages and cities situated upon its shores. Dwivida also,\nwho could assume what shape he would, enlarged his bulk to an immense size,\nand rolling and tumbling and trampling amidst the corn fields, he crushed and\nspoiled the harvests. The whole world, disordered by this iniquitous monkey,\nwas deprived of sacred study and religious rites, and was greatly afflicted.\n\nOn one occasion Hala.yudha was drinking in the groves of Raivata, along with\nthe illustrious Revati and other beautiful females; and the distinguished\nYadu, in whose praises songs were sung, and who was preeminent amidst graceful\nand sportive women, resembled Kuvera, the god of riches, in his palace. Whilst\nthus engaged, the monkey Dwivida came there, and stealing the ploughshare and\nthe club of Baladeva, grinned at and mocked him, and laughed at the women, and\nthrew over and broke the cups filled with wine. Balarama, becoming angry at\nthis, threatened the monkey; but the latter disregarded his menaces, and made\na chattering noise: on which Bala, starting up, seized his club in wrath;\n\np. 605\n\nand the monkey laid hold of a large rock, which he burled at the hero. Bala\ncasting his club at it, as it neared him, broke it into a thousand fragments,\nwhich, together with the club, fell upon the ground. Beholding the club\nprostrate, the monkey sprang over it, and struck the Yadava violently on the\nbreast with his paws. Bala replied with a blow of his fist upon the forehead\nof Dwivida, which felled him, vomiting blood, and lifeless, to the earth. The\ncrest of the mountain on which he fell was splintered into a hundred pieces by\nthe weight of his body, as if the thunderer had shivered it with his\nthunderbolt. The gods threw down a shower of flowers upon Rama, and approached\nhim, and praised him for the glorious feat he had performed. "Well has the\nworld been freed," said they, "by thy prowess, O hero, of this vile ape, who\nwas the ally of the enemy of the gods." Then they and their attendant spirits\nreturned well pleased to heaven. Many such inimitable deeds were wrought by\nthe illustrious Baladeva, the impersonation of \xc5\x9aesha, the supporter of the\nearth 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[605:1](vp153.htm#fr_1565) This exploit of Balarama is also similarly, but\nmore vulgarly, related in the Bhagavata. It is simply said in the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba,\nand erroneously, that Men\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a and Dwivida were conquered by Krishn\xcc\x81a.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXXVII](vp154.htm)\n\n'
