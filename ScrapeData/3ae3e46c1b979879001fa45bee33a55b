Nor is non-contradiction to be derived from the succession (of parts\nacceding to and departing from the soul), on account of the change, &c. (of\nthe soul).\n\nNor can the doctrine of the soul having the same size as the body be\nsatisfactorily established by means of the hypothesis of the successive\naccession and withdrawal of particles. For this hypothesis would involve the\nsoul's undergoing changes and the like. If the soul is continually being\nrepleted and depleted by the successive addition and withdrawal of parts, it\nof course follows that it undergoes change, and if it is liable to change it\nfollows that it is non-permanent, like the skin and similar substances. From\nthat, again, it follows that the _G_ aina doctrine of bondage and release is\nuntenable; according to which doctrine 'the soul, which in the state of\nbondage is encompassed by the ogdoad of works and sunk in the ocean of sa _m_\nsara, rises when its bonds are sundered, as the gourd rises to the surface of\nthe water when it is freed from the encumbering clay 1.'--Moreover, those\nparticles which in turns come and depart have the attributes of coming and\ngoing, and cannot, on that account, be of the nature of the Self any more than\nthe body is. And if it be said that the Self consists of some permanently\nremaining parts, we remark that it would be impossible to determine which are\nthe permanent and which the temporary parts.--We have further to ask from\nwhence those particles originate when they accede to the soul, and into what\nthey are merged when they detach themselves from it. They cannot spring from\nthe material elements\n\np. 433\n\nand re-enter the elements; for the soul is immaterial. Nor have we any means\nto prove the existence of some other, general or special, reservoir of soul-\nparticles.--Moreover, on the hypothesis under discussion the soul would be of\nindefinite nature, as the size of the particles acceding and departing is\nitself indefinite.--On account of all these and similar difficulties it cannot\nbe maintained that certain particles by turns attach themselves to, and detach\nthemselves from, the soul.\n\nThe Sutra may be taken in a different sense also. The preceding Sutra has\nproved that the soul if of the same size as the body cannot be permanent, as\nits entering into bigger and smaller bodies involves its limitation. To this\nthe Gymnosophist may be supposed to rejoin that although the soul's size\nsuccessively changes it may yet be permanent, just as the stream of water is\npermanent (although the water continually changes). An analogous instance\nwould be supplied by the permanency of the stream of ideas while the\nindividual ideas, as that of a red cloth and so on, are non-permanent.--To\nthis rejoinder our Sutra replies that if the stream is not real we are led\nback to the doctrine of a general void, and that, if it is something real, the\ndifficulties connected with the soul's changing, &c. present themselves and\nrender the _G_ aina view impossible.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[432:1](sbe34211.htm#fr_419) Cp.
