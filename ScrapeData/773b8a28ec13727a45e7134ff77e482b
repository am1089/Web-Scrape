Vivekananda,\nBrahmananda, Ramakrishnananda, Saradananda, Abhedananda and other disciples\nwere with Sri Ramakrishna The great national festival Durgapuja had been\ncelebrated only a few days back but it was difficult for the disciples to take\npart in the festivities with their whole heart. How could they rejoice when\ntheir Master was suffering from a serious malady? Their one thought was to\nserve Him, to nurse Him, to attend to His smallest wants day and night This\ndevoted and unparalleled service of the Master led the way for the younger\ndisciples (Vivekananda and others) to the great\n\np. 380\n\nrenunciation of the world of which Bhagavan Sri [Ramakrishna](errata.htm#5)\nwas the ideal example. Through their intense love for the Master they left\ntheir homes and sacrificed the duties and pleasures of life that they might\ngive their whole soul to His service.\n\nNotwithstanding His illness, hundreds of people came every day to pay\nreverential homage to Him. They were eager to receive His blessing and to sit\nin His presence if only for a few minutes; for His presence brought peace and\ncelestial happiness in the hearts and souls of all. Who had ever seen such\nunbounded compassion? He was anxious for the welfare of all those who came to\nHim and was ever ready to help them by removing their doubts and opening their\nspiritual eyes. This was the time when Bhagavan Sri Ramakrishna showed to the\nworld that He was not a man of this earth, but an embodiment of Infinite Love\nDivine.\n\nHis charm and fascination were so great that everyone who came into His\npresence would lose the consciousness of time and place. Even men like Dr.\nSircar, * who was the busiest physician\n\np. 381\n\nin Calcutta and who usually spent a few moments only with each patient, would\nremain with the Bhagavan hours together and sometimes the whole day. He had\njust now been paying Sri Ramakrishna a long visit. Rising to go, he said to\nthe Bhagavan, who was conversing with Syam Babu: * "Now that you have Syam\nBabu to talk to, I will bid you good-bye."\n\nSri Ramakrishna: Would you not like to hear some songs?\n\nDoctor: I should like it very much; but your feelings will be too much worked\nupon and you will go off into a state of ecstasy.\n\nThe doctor took his seat once more, and Vivekananda sang to the accompaniment\nof instruments:\n\np. 382\n\nGod and His Works\n\n1\\. Wonderful, infinite, is the universe made by Thee! Behold it is the\nrepository of all beauty.\n\n2\\. Thousands of stars do shine--a necklace of gold studded with gems.\nInnumerable are the moons and suns.\n\n3\\. The earth is adorned with wealth and corn full indeed is Thy storehouse. O\nGreat Lord! Innumerable are the stars which sing, "Well done, Lord! well\ndone!" They sing without ceasing.\n\nKali, the Mother of the Universe\n\n1\\. In the midst of the dense darkness, O Mother, breaketh forth the light of\nThy formless beauty.  \nFor this the Yogi meditateth in the mountain cave.\n\n2\\. In the lap of darkness infinite and borne on the sea of great Nirvana,  \nThe fragrance of peace everlasting floweth without ceasing.\n\n3\\. O Mother! who art Thou, seated alone within the Temple of [_Sam\nadhi_](errata.htm#6), assuming the form of the Great Consort of the Lord of\nEternity,\n\np. 383\n\nand wearing the apparel of darkness?  \nThe lotus of Thy feet keepeth us from fear; in them doth flash the lightning\nof Thy love for Thy children;  \nAnd loud laughter adorneth Thy spiritual face.\n\nDoctor (to Vivekananda): It is dangerous for Him--this singing. It will work\nupon His feelings with serious results.\n\nSri Ramakrishna (to Vivekananda): What does the doctor say?\n\nVivekananda: Sir, the doctor is afraid lest this singing bring on ecstasy\n(Bhava-Samadhi).\n\nSri Ramakrishna (to the doctor, with folded hands): No, oh no; why should my\nfeelings be worked upon? I am very well.\n\nBut as soon as these words were uttered, the Bhagavan, who was already losing\nsense-consciousness, went into deep _Sam adhi_. His body became motionless.\nThe eyes moved not. He sat speechless like a veritable figure of wood or\nstone. All sense-consciousness had ceased to be. The mind, the principle of\npersonal identity, the heart, had all stepped out of their wonted course\ntowards that One Object, the Mother of the Universe.\n\np. 384\n\nAgain did Vivekananda pour forth with his sweet, charming voice melody after\nmelody. He sang:\n\nThe Lord, My Husband\n\n1\\. How glorious is the beauty! How charming is the face! The Lord of my heart\nhath come to my (humble) abode.\n\n2\\. Lo! the spring of my love is running over (with joy)!\n\n3\\. O Lord of my soul! Thou who art pure love, what riches can I offer to\nThee? O, accept my heart, my life, my all. Yes, Lord, my all deign to accept!\n\nNothing Good or Beautiful Without the Lord\n\n1\\. What comfort can there be in life, O gracious Lord!  \nIf the bee of soul doth not always linger on Thy lotus-feet!\n\n2\\. What use can there be in countless wealth,  \nIf Thou, the most precious gem, art not kept with care!\n\n3\\. The tender face of the child I will not look upon,  \nIf in that face, lovely as the moon, I see not Thy loving face!\n\np. 385\n\n4\\. How beautiful the moonlight! Yet I see darkness alone, if at moonrise the\nmoon of Thy love doth not also rise in my soul.\n\n5\\. Even the pure love of the chaste wife will seem impure, if the gold of her\nlove he not set with the gem of Thy love Divine.\n\n6\\. Lord, like the sting of a poisonous snake is doubt of Thee, the offspring\nof ignorance.\n\n7\\. Lord, what more shall I say to Thee!  \nThou art the priceless Jewel of my heart, the Abode of joy everlasting!\n\nVivekananda sang again:\n\nThe Ecstatic Love of God\n\nWhen shall Love Divine enter my heart!  \nHaving all desires fulfilled, when shall I chant the Name of the Lord (Hari)\nwhile streams of love-tears flow from my eyes!  \nWhen shall my heart and soul be pure! O, when shall I go to the Vrindavan of\nlove! When will the fetters of the world drop off, and the darkness of my eyes\nbe dispelled by the collyrium of wisdom!  \nWhen shall the iron of my body be changed into gold by Thy touch Divine! p.\n386  \nWhen shall I see the world pervaded by God alone, and prostrate myself in the\npath of Love Divine!  \nWhen shall my religious works and daily duties be a thing of the past! When\nshall my sense of caste and family be gone!  \nO, when shall I rise above fear, anxiety and shame!  \nWhen shall I be free from pride and social customs!  \nWith the dust of the feet of true Bhaktas rubbed over my body;  \nWith the script of renunciation placed on my shoulders, when shall I drink in\nboth hands the water from the river of Love Divine!\n\nSri Ramakrishna had a special liking for this hymn from the Hindustani of\nZaffir, the Sufi poet:\n\nHymn\n\nThou art the refuge and joy of my heart.  \n  All that is Thou art, all in all Thou art;  \nOnly in Thee have I found my Beloved,  \n  All that is Thou art, all in all Thou art.\n\nThou art the dwelling of all Thy creatures.  \n  Where Thou abidest not can there be one heart, p. 387  \nIn each heart surely Thy Presence has entered;  \n  All that is Thou art, all in all Thou art.\n\nEither in men or angels triumphant, either in  \n  Hindu or Mussulman Thou art!  \nThy holy will has made everything like Thee;  \n  All that is Thou art, all in all Thou art.\n\nWhether Mohammedan temples or Hindu,  \n  Perfectly pure has Thy touch made each part.  \nAll heads before Thee have bowed in devotion;  \n  All that is Thou art, all in all Thou art.\n\nFrom the high heavens to earth spread before us,  \n  From the vast earth to the heavens Thou art,  \nWherever I look to my sight Thou appearest;  \n  All that is Thou art, all in all Thou art.\n\nThinking and pondering I have seen clearly,  \n  Searching I have found not another as Thou art;  \nNow in the mind of the poet has come that,  \n  All that is Thou art, all in all Thou art.\n\nIn the midst of the songs Sri Ramakrishna had come to Himself again. The music\nwas hushed. Then followed conversation with the Bhagavan,\n\np. 388\n\nwhich was always charming alike to the learned and the illiterate, to the old\nand the young, to men and women, to the great and the lowly. The whole company\nsat mute and looked in silence on His Divine face. Was there any trace now of\nthat serious illness from which He was suffering? Joy alone was there, and\nradiance of celestial glory. Turning to the doctor, Sri Ramakrishna began:\n\nThree obstacles in the way of perfection.Do give up shyness, doctor. One\nshould not be shy in repeating before others the Name of the Lord, or in\ndancing with joy while chanting His sweet name. Do not care what people may\nsay. There is a proverb: "Three obstacles lie in the way of perfection,--\nshyness, contempt and fear." The shy man thinks: "I, who am so important, how\ncan I dance in the name of the Lord? What will other great people say if they\nhear of it?" They may say: "What a shame! The poor doctor has lost his head!\nHe has danced while chanting the Name of the Lord!" Give up all such foolish\nideas.\n\nDoctor: That is not my line at all. I do not care what people say.\n\nSri Ramakrishna (smiling): On the contrary,\n\np. 389\n\nyou do care very much. True knowledge and ignorance.Go beyond knowledge and\nignorance, then you will realize God. Knowledge of diversity is ignorance. The\negotism bred of erudition proceeds from ignorance. That knowledge by which we\nknow that God exists everywhere is true knowledge. But to know Him intimately\nis realization (Vijnana).\n\nRealization.Suppose your foot is pierced with a thorn, you require a second\nthorn to take it out. When the first thorn is taken out you throw both away.\nSo in order to get rid of the thorn of ignorance you must bring the thorn of\nknowledge. Then you must throw away both ignorance and knowledge to attain to\nthe complete realization of God, the Absolute, for the Absolute is above and\nbeyond knowledge as well as ignorance. Lakshman once said to his Divine\nBrother: "O Rama, is it not strange that a God-knowing man like Vashishta Deva\nshould have wept for the loss of his sons and would not be comforted?"\nKnowledge is relative.Thereupon Rama replied: "He who has knowledge has also\nsome ignorance. He who has knowledge of one object has also the knowledge of\nmany objects. He who has the knowledge of light has also the\n\np. 390\n\nknowledge of darkness, but Brahman the Absolute is beyond knowledge and\nignorance and above virtue and vice merit and demerit, purity and impurity."\n\nSyam Babu: Sir, may I ask what remains after both thorns are thrown away?\n\nThe Absolute Brahman.Sri Ramakrishna: What remains is the Absolute, called in\nthe Vedas _Nityasuddha-bodharupam_ (the unchangeable, the absolutely pure\nsource of all knowledge). But how shall I explain it to you? Suppose some one\nasks you what is the taste of Ghee (clarified butter) like? Is it possible to\ndefine it? The utmost that you can say is that it is precisely like the taste\nof Ghee. A young girl once asked a friend: "Your husband is come: tell me what\nsort of joy you feel when you meet him?\': Thereupon the married friend\nreplied: "My dear, you will know everything when you have got a husband of\nyour own; how can I explain it to you?"\n\nIn the Puranas we are told that the Mother of the Universe incarnated Herself\nas the daughter of the presiding god of the Himalayas Just after she was born,\nthe king of the mountains was blessed with a vision of the various\nmanifestations of the Omnipotent Mother.\n\np. 391\n\n[paragraph continues] Then he said: "O Mother! Let me see Brahman about whom\nthere is so much in the Vedas." The child Incarnate thereupon said: "O father\nif thou wishest to see the Absolute Brahman thou must associate with the holy\nsages who have renounced everything. What the Absolute Brahman is cannot be\nexpressed in words." The Tantra has well said: "All things with the sole\nexception of God the Absolute, have become defiled like leavings of food." The\nidea is that the Sacred Scriptures of the world having been read and recited\nwith the aid of the tongue have got defiled like food thrown out of the mouth.\nThe Absolute Brahman, however, no one has ever been able to describe by word\nof mouth. Therefore it is said that the Absolute is not defiled by the mouth.\nAgain, who can express in words the blissful joy that one experiences in the\ncompany of the Lord and in communion with the Absolute _Sat-Chit- \xc3\x82nanda_. He\nalone knows who has been blessed with such realization.\n\nAddressing the doctor, Sri Ramakrishna continued: True knowledge does not come\nuntil egotism is entirely gone.\n\n"When shall I be free?" When "I" shall cease to be. The sense of "I" and\n"mine" is\n\np. 392\n\nEgotism and knowledge.ignorance. The sense of "Thou" and "Thine" is knowledge.\nA true Bhakta says: "O Lord! Thou art the doer, Thou hast created everything,\nI am nothing but an instrument in Thy hands. I do only whatever Thou makest me\ndo. All this is Thy wealth, Thy glory. Thine is the Universe, Thine, the\nfamily, Thine the relatives. Nothing belongs to me, I am Thy servant. Thine is\nto command and mine is to serve Thee with my whole heart and soul."Prayer of a\ntrue Bhakta.\n\nEgotism.Egotism comes to all those who have studied a few books and have\nacquired a little learning. I had a talk with Tagore * about the nature of\nGod. He said to me: "I know all about it." I replied: "He who has been to\nDelhi does not go about telling others \'I have been to Delhi\' and so on. He\nwho is a true gentleman does not boast of being a gentleman."\n\nSyam Babu: Sir, Tagore has great respect for you.\n\nSri Ramakrishna: My dear sir, shall I tell you of the vanity of the sweeper-\nwoman in the temple at Dakshineswara? She had a few ornaments\n\np. 393\n\nVanity.on her person and she was so vain that whenever she walked along the\nroad, if she found anyone near she would shout: "Get out of my way! Get out of\nmy way!" What shall I say about the vanity of wealthy people of higher castes!\n\nA devotee: If God is the one Actor in the Universe, then whence come good and\nevil, 1 virtue and vice? Do they exist by His will?\n\nThe Lord untouched by good and evil.Sri Ramakrishna: In this world of\nrelativity, good and evil, virtue and vice, exist, but they do not touch the\nLord. God is unattached to them--like the wind which is unaffected by the good\nor bad odor which it carries. His creation is of dual nature, consisting of\ngood and evil, real and unreal. As among trees there are some which bear good\nfruits, others poisonous, so among human beings there are good men and wicked,\nsinful men. Wicked people have their place in the world. Do you not see that\nwicked people are necessary to govern the law-breakers and evil-doers of a\ncommunity?\n\nSyam Babu: Sir, we are told on the one hand that man is punished for his sins,\nand on the other that God is the sole Actor, all creatures\n\np. 394\n\nbeing humble instruments in His hands. How shall we reconcile these two\nthings?\n\nSri Ramakrishna: You talk like a gold merchant weighing things with his\ndelicate balance.\n\nVivekananda: What the Bhagavan means to Calculating say is that you are\ntalking like one intellect. who has a calculating intellect.\n\nSri Ramakrishna: I say, O Podo, eat these mangoes! What is the use of counting\nhow many mango-trees there are in the garden, how many thousands of branches,\nhow many millions of leaves, and so on? You are here to eat the mangoes. Eat\nthem and go away. (To Syam Babu) You have come into this world to realize God\nby means of religious works. Your first effort should be to acquire love\n(Bhakti) for the lotus feet of the Almighty. Why do you trouble yourself with\nother things? What will you gain by discussing philosophy? Do you not see\nthat, four ounces of wine are quite enough to intoxicate you? Why do you then\ninquire how many barrels of wine there are in the wine-shop? Of what use is\nsuch vain calculation?\n\nDoctor: God\'s wine, again, is beyond all measure. The supply can never be\nexhausted.\n\nSri Ramakrishna (to Syam Babu): Furthermore,\n\np. 395\n\nLay cares on God.why do you not execute a power of attorney in favor of the\nLord? Let all your cares and responsibilities rest on Him. If any one trusts\nan honest man, will that man do any wrong? God alone knows whether He will\npunish sinful acts or not.\n\nDoctor: He alone knows what is in His mind. How can man surmise it? He is\nbeyond all human calculation.\n\nSri Ramakrishna (to Syam Babu): You people of Calcutta always find fault with\nDivine Justice. You often complain that God is partial because he makes one\nhappy and another unhappy. You foolish people see in God the same nature as\nyour own. Hem used to come to Dakshineswara with his friends. Whenever he saw\nme he would say: "Sir, there is only one thing worth having in this world and\nthat is honor, is it not so?" Very few understand that the end of human life\nis to attain God.\n\nSubtle body.Syam Babu: Sir, is it possible for anyone to show the subtle body?\nCan anyone show that the subtle body goes out of the gross body?\n\nSri Ramakrishna: Those who are true Bhaktas will not care to show you all\nthis. They do not care in the least whether fools will respect\n\np. 396\n\nthem or not. They do not seek the favor of rich people.\n\nSyam Babu: Well, Sir, what is the difference between the gross body and the\nsubtle body?\n\nSri Ramakrishna: This physical body made of gross elements is called the gross\nbody. _Manas_ (mind), the _Buddhi_ (intellect), _Ahamk ara_ (egoism) and\n_Chitta_ , all these are in the subtle body. The inner body which feels the\njoy of the Lord and Divine ecstasy is called _K arana Sarira_ (causal body).\nThe Tantras call it _Bh agavat-Tanu_, or the body derived from the Divine\nMother. Beyond these is the Mahakarana, the first Great Cause. It is the\nfourth state. It cannot be expressed by words.\n\nThe importance of practice.What is the use of hearing all this? Practise and\nyou will know. You repeat the words " _Siddhi_ , _Siddhi_ " (hemp-leaves).\nWill that make you drunk? No, you must swallow some. There are threads of\nvarious numbers, No. 40, No. 41, and so on; but you do not know one number\nfrom another unless you are in the trade. It is by no means hard for those in-\nthe trade to know a particular number from that of another number. That being\nso, I say, practise a little. That done, it will be easy for you to have\ncorrect ideas as to\n\np. 397\n\nthe gross body, the subtle body, the Karana (the causal body made of joy) and\nthe Mahakarana (the Great Cause or the Unconditioned).\n\nWhen you pray, ask for Bhakti, devotion to His Lotus Feet. After Ahalya * was\nmade free from the curse called down upon her by her husband, Rama Chandra\nsaid: "Ask for a boon from me." Ahalya replied: "O Rama, if Thou wilt give me\na boon, do Thou grant that my mind may, ever be on Thy feet beautiful like the\nlotus. O, I may be born among swine, but that will not matter."\n\nPrayer for Bhakti.For my part, I pray for love (Bhakti) alone to my Divine\nMother. Putting flowers upon Her Lotus Feet, with folded hands I prayed:\n"Mother, here is ignorance, here is knowledge. Oh! Take them; I want them not.\nGrant that I may have pure love alone. Here is cleanliness (of the mind and\nbody), here is uncleanliness; what shall I do with them? Let me have pure love\nalone.\n\np. 398\n\n[paragraph continues] Oh! Here is sin, here is merit; I want neither the one\nnor the other. Let me have pure love alone. Here is good, here is evil. Oh!\nTake them; I want them not. Let me have pure love alone. Here are good works,\nhere are bad works. Oh! Place me above them; I want them not. Grant that I may\nhave pure love alone."\n\nDual existence.If you take the fruit of good works, like charity, you must\ntake the fruit of bad works also. If you take the fruit of merit, you must\ntake the fruit of sin also. Knowledge of the One (Jnana) implies knowledge of\nthe many (Ajnana). Taking cleanliness, you cannot get rid of its opposite,\nuncleanliness. Thus a knowledge of light implies a knowledge of darkness, its\nopposite. A knowledge of unity implies a knowledge of diversity.\n\nAnimal food and vegetarianism.Blessed is the man who loves God! What matters\nit if he eats the flesh of swine? On the other hand, if a man lives upon\nvegetables but is attached to the world and does not love God, what good shall\nhe gain?\n\n(To Syam Babu) To live the life of a householder is by no means wrong. But\ntake care\n\np. 399\n\nWork with the mind fixed on God.that you work without attachment, with your\nmind always pointing to the Feet of the Lord. Suppose a person has a carbuncle\non the back. Now this man talks as usual. Perhaps he attends to his daily\nwork. But pain constantly puts him in mind of the carbuncle. In the same way,\nalthough you are in the world, you should turn your mind constantly to God. A\nwoman carrying on an intrigue with a lover thinks of this lover all the time\nthat she is attending to her household duties. Live in the world like such a\nwoman, doing your many duties with your soul secretly yearning for the Lord.\n\nTheosophy.Syam Babu: Sir, what do you think of Theosophy?\n\nSri Ramakrishna: The long and the short of the matter is that people who make\ndisciples belong to an inferior order of men. Again, those who seek for powers\nalso belong to an inferior class, such powers, for example, as the power of\ngetting across the Ganges or the power of reporting here what a person is\ntalking about in a far country, and other psychic powers. It is by no means\neasy for such people to get pure Bhakti (love) for the Lord.\n\np. 400\n\nSyam Babu: But, Sir, the Theosophists seek to put Hinduism once more on a firm\nbasis.\n\nSri Ramakrishna: That may be. I am not well posted as to their views or\ndoings.\n\nSyam Babu: Questions like the following are dealt with in Theosophy. What\nregion is the soul bound for after death--the lunar sphere or the stellar\nmansions?\n\nSri Ramakrishna: I dare say. But let me give you an idea of my way of\nthinking. Somebody put it to Hanuman, the great lover of God, "What day of the\nlunar fortnight is it?" Hanuman replied: "My dear sir, excuse me. I know\nnothing about the days of the week, the day of the lunar fortnight, or the\nstars telling of the destiny on a particular day. That is not my concern. I\nmeditate on Rama and on Rama alone."\n\nSyam Babu: Sir, the Theosophists believe in Mahatmas. May I ask whether you\nhold that Mahatmas are real beings?\n\nSri Ramakrishna: If you care to take my word for truth, I say "Yes." But will\nyou be good enough to let these matters alone? Come when I am better. Do but\nput faith in my words and I shall see that you find peace. Do you not observe\nthat I do not take either money\n\np. 401\n\nor clothes or any other thing? In some theatrical representations well-to-do\nvisitors are expected to encourage the actors by gifts of money during the\nperformance. Here people are not called upon to make such gifts. This is why\nso many come here.\n\n(To the Doctor) What I have to say to you is this--but do not take offence!\nYou have had enough of the things of the world, money, fame, lectures, and so\non. Now give your mind a little to God, and come here now and then. It is good\nto listen to words relating to God. Such words enlighten the soul and turn it\nto the Lord.\n\nA short while after the Doctor stood up to say good-bye. But just then Girish\ncame in, and the Doctor was so glad to see him that he took his seat again.\nGirish, stepping forward, saluted the Bhagavan and kissed the dust of His\nhallowed feet. The Doctor watched all this in silence.\n\nDoctor: So long as I was here, Girish Babu was not good enough to come. He\nmust come just as I am about to go.\n\nThere was then a talk about the Science Association and the lectures delivered\nthere. Girish took an interest in these lectures.\n\np. 402\n\nSri Ramakrishna (to the Doctor): Will you take me some day to the Association?\n\nDoctor: My dear Sir, once you are there, you would lose all sense-\nconsciousness at the sight of the glorious and wonderful works of God, of the\nintelligence shown in these works and the adaptation of the means to the end.\n\nSri Ramakrishna: Oh indeed!\n\nWorship of the spiritual preceptor.Doctor (to Girish): Do everything else, but\npray do not worship Him as God. By doing so, you are only bringing ruin on\nsuch a holy man.\n\nGirish: Sir, there is, I fear, no help for it. He who has enabled me to get\nacross this terrible sea of the world and the no less terrible sea of\nscepticism--how else shall I serve such a person? There is nothing in Him I\ncannot worship.\n\nDoctor: I myself hold that all men are equal. As to this holy man, do you\nthink I cannot salute and kiss the dust of His feet? Look here! (The Doctor\nsaluted and kissed the dust of the Bhagavan\'s feet.)\n\nGirish: Oh, sir, the angels in heaven are saying: "Blessed, blessed be this\nauspicious moment!"\n\nDoctor: You seem to think that saluting\n\np. 403\n\nanyone\'s feet is something like a marvel! You do not see that I can do the\nsame in the case of everybody. (To a gentleman seated near) Now, sir, oblige\nme by allowing me to salute your feet. (To another) And you, sir. (To a third)\nAnd you, sir. (The Doctor saluted the feet of many.)\n\nVivekananda (to the Doctor): Sir, we look upon the Bhagavan as a person who is\nlike God. Let me make my idea clear to you. There is a point somewhere between\nthe vegetable creation and the animal creation where it is difficult to say\nwhether a particular thing is a vegetable or an animal. Much in the same way\nthere is a point somewhere between the man-world and the God-world where you\ncannot say with certainty whether a person is a human being or God.\n\nDoctor: Well, my friend, matters relating to God cannot be explained by\nanalogy.\n\nVivekananda: I say, not God, but Godlike man.\n\nDoctor: You should not give vent to feelings of reverence like that. Speaking\nfor myself, no ne has been able, I am sorry to say, to judge my inward\nfeelings. My best friends often regard me as stern and cruel. Even you, my\n\np. 404\n\ngood friends, may beat me some day with shoes and turn me out.\n\nSri Ramakrishna (to the Doctor): Do not say that, Doctor. These people love\nyou so much! They watch and look for you like ladies come together in the\nbride-chamber looking for the coming bridegroom.\n\nGirish: Everyone here has the greatest respect for you.\n\nDoctor (sorrowfully): My son--even my wife looks upon me as hard-hearted, and\nfor the simple reason that I am by nature loath to show my feelings.\n\nGirish: In that case, sir, do you not think it would be better to throw open\nthe door of your mind, at least out of pity for your friends? You well see\nthat your friends do not understand you.\n\nDoctor: Shall I say it? Well, my feelings are worked up even more than yours.\n(To Vivekananda) I shed tears in solitude.\n\nDoctor (to Sri Ramakrishna): Sir, may I say that it is not good that you allow\npeople to touch your feet with their body while you are in _Sam adhi?_\n\nSri Ramakrishna: You do not mean that I am conscious of this?\n\np. 405\n\nDoctor: You feel that it is not a right thing to do, do you not?\n\nSri Ramakrishna: What shall I say as regards the state of my mind during _Sam\nadhi?_ After the Samadhi is over I often go so far as to ask myself: May not\nthis be the cause of the disease that I have got? The thing is, the thought of\nGod makes me mad. All this is the result of Divine madness. There is no help\nfor it.\n\nDoctor (to the disciples): He expresses regret for what he does. He feels that\nthe act is wrong.\n\nSri Ramakrishna (to Girish): You have great penetration. You explain it all to\nhim, will you not?\n\nGirish (to the Doctor): Sir, you are quite mistaken. He is by no means sorry\nthat His feet touch the persons of the devotees. No, it is not that. His body\nis pure, sinless; it is purity itself. He is good enough, in His anxiety for\ntheir spiritual welfare, to allow His Hallowed Feet to touch the bodies of the\ndevotees. As a result of His taking their sins upon Himself, His own body, He\nthinks, may be suffering from disease. Think of your own case. You were once\ntaken ill, so you have told us, as the\n\np. 406\n\nresult of hard study. Well, did you not at that time express regret that you\nhad sat up reading until very late at night? Does that prove that reading\nuntil the late hours of the night is bad? The Bhagavan may be sorry from the\npoint of view of the patient; He is by no means sorry from the point of view\nof a Teacher from God anxious for the welfare of humanity.\n\nDoctor (somewhat disconcerted): I confess I am beaten. Now give me the dust of\nyour feet. (To Vivekananda) This matter apart, I must admit the acuteness of\nGirish\'s intellectual powers.\n\nVivekananda (to the Doctor): You may view the question in another way. You\nsometimes devote your life to the task of making a scientific discovery, and\nthen you do not look to your body, your health or anything. Now the knowledge\nof God is the grandest of all sciences; is it not natural that the Bhagavan\nhas risked His health for this end, and, it may be, sacrificed it? We offer to\nHim worship equal to Divine worship.\n\nThe doctor then saluted the Bhagavan and took his leave. At that moment Bijoy\nentered and prostrated himself at the feet of Sri Ramakrishna.\n\np. 407\n\n[paragraph continues] He had been making pilgrimages to various holy places,\nand Mahima said to him: Sir, you have just returned from a pilgrimage; you\nhave seen many things, kindly tell us about them.\n\nPilgrimage useless.Bijoy: What shall I say? I see now that here I find\neverything. To go on pilgrimages is useless travelling. There are some places\nwhere you will find one-sixteenth, or at the utmost one-fourth, of what you\nsee here. In the Bhagavan I find everything in full complement. I have not\nfound anyone who possesses anything more than our Bhagavan.\n\nRamakrishna (to Vivekananda): Look what a wonderful change has taken place in\nBijoy. His character has become entirely different, as if the milk has been\nboiled and thickened. By seeing the neck and forehead I can recognize the\nstate of _Paramahamsa_.\n\nMahima (to Bijoy): Sir, you take very little food, do you not?\n\nBijoy: Yes, I believe I do. (To Ramakrishna) Revered Sir, hearing of Thy\nillness I have come to see Thee.\n\nRamakrishna: What?\n\nBijoy kept silent for a while and then said,\n\np. 408\n\n[paragraph continues] No one can understand Thy perfection unless Thou givest\nthe power.\n\nRamakrishna: Kedar said to me that when he went to other places he starved,\nbut that here he always found food in abundance.\n\nBijoy (clasping his hands before [Ramakrishna](errata.htm#7)): Lord, I know\nThee now. I understand Thy glory. Thou needest not tell me of it.\n\nThereupon Ramakrishna went into Samadhi. When He returned, He said: "If that\nbe so, let it be so."\n\nBijoy: Yes, Lord, now I know Thee.\n\nSaying this, Bijoy prostrated himself before Ramakrishna and pressed to his\nbreast the Hallowed Feet of the Lord. Bhagavan Sri Ramakrishna, again losing\nall sense-consciousness, entered into God-consciousness and remained\nmotionless like a carven image. Seeing this wonderful sight, some of the\ndevotees shed tears of joy and happiness while others kneeled and began to\npray to the Bhagavan. Each one fixed his eyes upon Sri Ramakrishna and,\naccording to the innermost feeling of his heart, realized his Ideal in Him.\nSome saw in Him the Ideal Devotee, while others recognized the Divine\nIncarnation in a human form. Mahima, with tears of joy in his eyes chanted:\n"Behold,\n\np. 409\n\nbehold, the embodiment of Divine Love!" And after a few minutes, as if\ncatching a glimpse of the Absolute Brahman in Ramakrishna, he exclaimed:\n"Infinite Existence, Intelligence and Love, beyond Unity and Diversity!"\n\nAvatara.After remaining in this state for a long time, Bhagavan Ramakrishna\ncame down once more on the human plane and said: God incarnates Himself in a\nhuman form. It is true that He dwells everywhere, in all living creatures, but\nthe desires of the human soul cannot be fulfilled except by an _Avat ara_ or\nDivine Incarnation. The human being longs to see Him, touch Him, be with Him\nand enjoy His Divine company. In order to fulfill such desires, the\nIncarnation of God is necessary.\n\nWhen an Avatara or Divine Incarnation descends, however, the people at large\ndo not know it. It is known only to a few chosen disciples. Can everyone\ncomprehend the indivisible Absolute Brahman, Existence-Intelligence-Bliss\nAbsolute?\n\nRama.When the Supreme Lord incarnated Himself as Rama, only twelve sages knew\nit. The other saints and sages knew Him as the prince of the Raja Dasaratha.\nBut those twelve sages prayed to Him, saying: "O\n\np. 410\n\n[paragraph continues] Rama, Thou art the indivisible Existence-Intelligence-\nBliss Absolute. Thou hast incarnated in this human form. By Thine own power of\nMaya Thou appearest as a human being, but in reality Thou art the Lord of the\nuniverse."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[380:*](gork16.htm#fr_99) Dr. Mehendra lal Sircar was the best Hindu physician\np. 381 in Calcutta at that time.
