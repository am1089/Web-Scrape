Now (follows the description of) an Atik _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance. 1\n\n2\\. Let him eat as much as he can take at one (mouthful, and follow the rules\ngiven) above for a K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra, (viz.) to eat during three days in the\nmorning, (during another three days) in the evening, (during further three\ndays) food given without\n\np. 124\n\nasking, and to fast during the last three days. That is an Atik _ri_ _k_ _kh_\nra.\n\n3\\. A K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance (during the performance of which one)\nsubsists on water (only is called) a K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ratik _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra. 3\n\n4\\. The peculiar observances (prescribed during the performance) of K _ri_ _k_\n_kh_ ra penances (are as follows): 4\n\n5\\. 'Having cut his nails, (the performer) shall cause his beard and all his\nhair to be shaved off, excepting the eyebrows, the eyelashes, and the lock at\nthe top of the head; (wear) one garment only; he shall eat blameless food;\nwhat one obtains by going to beg once (is called) blameless food; he shall\nbathe in the morning, at noon, and in the evening; he shall carry a stick\n(and) a waterpot; he shall avoid to speak to women and _S_ udras; carefully\nkeeping himself in an upright or sitting posture, he shall stand during the\nday, and remain seated during the night.' Thus speaks the divine Vasish _th_\na.\n\n6\\. Let him not instruct in these Institutes of the sacred law anybody but his\nson or a pupil who stays (in his house at least) for a year. 6\n\n7\\. The fee (for teaching it) is one thousand (pa _n_ as), (or) ten cows and a\nbull, or the worship of the teacher.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[123:1](sbe1427.htm#fr_670)-2. **XXIV**.

I do not think that his correction is\nsatisfactory, and propose in its stead, sa tadyadetad (dharma _s_ astram).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXV](sbe1428.htm)\n\n"
