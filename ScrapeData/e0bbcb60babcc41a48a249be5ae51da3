Not also on account of its resembling (the manasa cup) (can the fires\nconstitute parts of an action); for it is observed (on the ground of _S_ ruti,\n&c., that they are independent); as in the case of death; for the world does\nnot become (a fire) (because it resembles a fire in some points).\n\nAgainst the allegation made by the purvapakshin that the present case is\nanalogous to that of the manasa cup, we\n\np. 267\n\nremark that the fire-altars made of mind and so on cannot be assumed to\nsupplement a sacrificial action although they may resemble the manasa cup,\nsince on the ground of direct enunciation &c. they are seen to subserve the\npurpose of man only (not the purpose of some sacrificial action). Anything\nindeed may resemble anything in some point or other; but in spite of that\nthere remains the individual dissimilarity of each thing from all other\nthings. The case is analogous to that of death. In the passages, 'The man in\nthat orb is death indeed' ( _S_ at. Bra. X, 5, 2, 3), and 'Agni indeed is\ndeath' (Taitt. Sa _m_ h. V, i, 10, 3), the term 'death' is applied equally to\nAgni and the man in the sun; all the same the two are by no means absolutely\nequal. And if the text says in another place, 'This world is a fire indeed, O\nGotama; the sun is its fuel,' &c. ( _Kh_. Up. V, 4, i), it does not follow\nfrom the similarity of fuel and so on that the world really is a fire. Thus\nalso in our case.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 52](sbe38195.htm)\n\n"
