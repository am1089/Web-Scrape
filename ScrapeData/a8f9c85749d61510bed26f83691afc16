Bathing is suitable for (the practice of) austerity.\n\n2\\. The libation to the manes (is offered) after the gods have been satisfied\n(with water),\n\n3\\. They pour out water which gives strength, from one Tirtha after the other.\n3\n\n4\\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'With flowing, unconfined\nwater twice-born men of the three castes shall satisfy the gods, _Ri_ shis,\nand manes, when they have risen in the morning.'\n\n5\\. 'They shall not offer (libations of water) con-fined (in tanks and wells),\n(If they do it), he who made the embankment; will obtain a share (of the merit\nof their devotion).' 5\n\n6\\. 'Therefore let him avoid embankments (around tanks) and wells made by\nothers.' 6\n\n7\\. Nov they quote also (the following verse): 'Or, in times of distress--not\nas a rule--he may bathe in (water) confined (in tanks), after taking out three\nlumps (of earth); from a well (let him take three) lumps of clay and three\njars of water.' 7\n\np. 239\n\n8\\. If he has accepted presents from one who is able to give presents to many,\nor from one whose presents ought not to be accepted, or if he has sacrificed\nfor one for whom he ought not to have sacrificed, or if he has eaten food\n(given by a person) whose food must not be eaten, he shall mutter the\nTaratsamandiya. 8\n\n9\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): Those who improperly associate\nwith (an outcast) teacher, those who improperly associate with (outcast)\npupils, and those who improperly associate (with outcasts) by (accepting\ntheir) food or by (reciting) Mantras (for them), enter into deep darkness.'\n\n10\\. Now (follow) the duties of a Snataka. 10\n\n11\\. After offering at the morning and at the evening (meals) with (a portion\nof) the food which he may have, the Vai _s_ vadeva and the Bali-offerings, he\nshall honour, according to his ability, Brahma _n_ as, Kshatriyas, Vai _s_\nyas, and _S_ udras (who may come to his house as) guests. 11\n\n12\\. If he cannot (afford to give food) to many, let him give (something) to\none who possesses good qualities,\n\n13\\. Or to him who has come first.\n\n14, If a _S_ udra (has come as) a guest, he shall order him (to do some) work,\n(and feed him afterwards); 14\n\np. 240\n\n15\\. Or (if he cannot spare much), he may give a first portion (agrya) to a\n_S_ rotriya. 15\n\n16\\. It is prescribed that the division (of the food) shall be made without\ndetriment to (the interests of) those who daily receive a portion. 16\n\n17\\. But he shall never eat without having given away (some small portion of\nthe food).\n\n18\\. Now they quote also two verses which have been proclaimed by (the goddess\nof) food: 'Him who, without giving me to the gods, the manes, his servants,\nhis guests and friends, consumes what has been prepared and (thus), in his\nexceeding folly, swallows poison, I consume, and I am his death. But for him\nwho, offering the Agnihotra, performing the Vai _s_ vadeva, and honouring\nguests, eats, full of contentment, purity, and faith, what remains after\nfeeding those whom he must support, I become ambrosia, and he (really) enjoys\nme.'\n\n19\\. Presents of money must be given, according to one's ability, to good\nBrahma _n_ as, _S_ rotriyas, and Vedaparagas, when they beg outside the Vedi,\nfor the sake of Gurus, in order to defray (the expenses of) their marriages,\nor of medicine, or when they are distressed for a livelihood, or desirous to\noffer a sacrifice, or engaged in studying, or on a journey, or have performed\na Vi _s_ va _g_ it sacrifice. 19\n\np. 241\n\n20\\. Cooked food (must be given) to other (beggars). 20\n\n21\\. Let him eat (seated) in a pure, enclosed place, after having well washed\nhis hands and feet and after having sipped water, respectfully receiving the\nfood which is brought to him, keeping himself free from lust, anger, hatred,\ngreed, and perplexity, (conveying the food into his mouth) with all his\nfingers and making no noise (during mastication). 21\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[238:3](sbe1459.htm#fr_1173) **5**. As to the Tirthas, see above, I, 5, 8,\n15-16.\n\n[238:5](sbe1459.htm#fr_1174) Manu IV, 201.\n\n[238:6](sbe1459.htm#fr_1175) Vish _n_ u LXIV, 1.\n\n[238:7](sbe1459.htm#fr_1176) Vish _n_ u LXIV, 2. I read the verse as follows:\nuddh _ri_ tya vapi trin pi _n_ _d_ an kuiyad apatsu no sada | niruddhasu _k_ a\nm _ri_ tpi _n_ _d_ an kupat trin abgha _t_ a _m_ statheti || The Dekhan MSS.\nread at the end of the second half verse, kupa _m_ strinava _t_ a _m_ statha;\nM. has kupat _r i_nabapa _t_ anstatha while C. I. gives kupat trin gha _t_ a\n_m_ statha. Nandapa _n_ _d_ ita on Vish _n_ u, loc. cit., seems to have had\nthe latter p. 239 reading, and to have changed it to 'kupat to trin gha _t_ a\n_m_ statha,' in order to save the metre. The sense remains the same.\n\n[239:8](sbe1459.htm#fr_1177) Manu XI, 254. The text is found Rig-veda IX, 58.\nGovinda explains bahupratigrahya, 'one who is able to give presents to many,'\nby bahubh _ri_ tyabhara _n_ akshama, 'one who is able to support many\nservants.'\n\n[239:10](sbe1459.htm#fr_1178) Vasish _th_ a XII, 1.\n\n[239:11](sbe1459.htm#fr_1179) Vasish _th_ a XI, 3-9.\n\n[239:14](sbe1459.htm#fr_1180) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 2, 4, 19.\n\n[240:15](sbe1459.htm#fr_1181) Vasish _th_ a XI, 5. Govinda quotes a verse,\naccording to which an agrya, 'first portion,' is equal to sixteen mouthfuls,\neach of the size of a peahen's egg.\n\n[240:16](sbe1459.htm#fr_1182) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 4, 9,10-11.
