O Agni! May we to-day successfully perform,\nwith thy heedfulness [2](sbe46099.htm#an_4:10:1:2), this praise\n[3](sbe46099.htm#an_4:10:1:3) which touches thy heart, which is like a horse,\nlike auspicious power of the mind.\n\n2\\. For verily thou, O Agni, hast become the charioteer of auspicious power of\nthe mind, of real ability, and of the mighty _Ri_ ta.\n\n3\\. Through these our hymns direct thyself hither-wards to us like the sun\nwith its light [1](sbe46099.htm#an_4:10:3:1), O Agni, gracious with all thy\nfaces.\n\n4\\. May we to-day worship thee, O Agni, praising thee with these songs. Thy\nroarings thunder like (the thunder) of Heaven.\n\n5\\. Thy sweetest aspect, O Agni, shines near us for glory's sake, now by day,\nnow by night, like gold.\n\n6\\. Like purified gh _ri_ ta is thy stainless body; (it is) brilliant gold:\nthat (body) of thine has shone [1](sbe46099.htm#an_4:10:6:1), O self-dependent\none, like gold.\n\n7\\. For even a malice which one has committed, thou verily drivest away\nentirely, O righteous Agni, from the sacrificing mortal\n[1](sbe46099.htm#an_4:10:7:1).\n\n8\\. May our friendship, O Agni, our brotherhood with you, the gods, be\nblessed. This is our navel (i. e. relation) in our seat, in this udder\n[1](sbe46099.htm#an_4:10:8:1).\n\np. 351\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi. The metre is stated to be Padapa\xe1\xb9\x85kti (verses 4, 6, 7,\nPadapa\xe1\xb9\x85kti or Ush _n_ ih; verse 5, Mahapadapa\xe1\xb9\x85kti; verse 8, Ush _n_ ih): see\non this metre M. M., vol. xxxii, p. xcviii seq.; H. O., Prolegomena, p. 98;\nKuhnau, Die Trish _t_ ubh- _G_ agati-Familie, p. 234 seq.--Verse 1 = SV. I,\n434; MS. I, 10, 3. Verses 1-3 = SV. II, 1127-1129; VS. XV, 44-46\\. Verses 1-4\n= TS. IV, 4, 4, 7. Verse 1, 2, 4 = MS. II, 13, 8. Verse 3 = MS. IV, 10, 2.\nVerse 6 = TS. II, 2, 12, 7; MS. IV, 12, 4.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. The Avasana in this verse ought to stand before h _ri_ disp _ri_ _s_\nam, not after this word, as the traditional text places it. _Ri_ dhyama,\nconsequently, cannot be accented.\n\nNote 2. Dr. Neisser's opinion on oha is different (Bezzenberger's Beitrage,\nXVIII, 312).\n\nNote 3. I read stomam, which is frequently found as the object of the verb\n_ri_ dh, and which in several passages receives the epithet h _ri_ disp _r i_\n_s_.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. On the syntactical form of this comparison, see Bergaigne, Melanges\nRenier, p. 95.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Or ro _k_ ate, 'shines'?\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. The Avasana ought to stand before martat. Cf. above, verse 1, note 1.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. Cf. above, IV, 7, 7. The meaning seems to be: in this sacrificial\nplace, where the cows give milk.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 11](sbe46100.htm)\n\n"
