One without a Second.\n\nIf you ask, what then is real in all things and in every individual soul? the\nanswer is, Brahman, the One without a Second, the One besides whom there is\nnothing; but this answer can be understood by those only who know Avidya, and\nby knowing it have destroyed it. Others believe that the world is this or\nthat, and that they themselves are this and that. Man thinks that he is an Ego\ndwelling in the body, seeing and hearing, comprehending and reasoning,\nreasoning and acting, while with the strict Vedantist the true Self lies deep\nbelow the Ego, or the Aham, which belongs to the world of illusion. As an Ego,\nman has become already an actor and enjoyer, instead of remaining a distant\nwitness of the world. He is then carried along into the Sa _m_ sara, the\nconcourse of the world; he becomes the creature or the slave of his\naccumulated acts (karman), and goes on from change to change, till in the end\nhe discovers the true Brahman which alone really exists, and which as being\nhimself is called \xc3\x82tman or Self, and at the same time Paramatman, or the\nHighest, \xc3\x82tman and Brahman, both being one and the same thing. Good works may\nbe helpful in producing a proper state of mind for receiving this knowledge,\nbut it is by knowledge alone that men can be saved and obtain Mukti, freedom,\nand not by good works. This salvation or freedom finds expression in the\ncelebrated\n\np. 75\n\nwords Tat tvam asi, thou art that, i.e. thou art not thou, but that, i.e. the\nonly existing Brahman; the \xc3\x82tman, the Self, and the Brahman are one and the\nsame.\n\nStrange as Sa _m_ kara's monism may seem to us, yet the current idea that God\ncreated the world out of nothing can, strictly speaking, mean nothing else\nthan that nothing can ever exist by the side of God, that God, out of His own\nenergy, supplied both the material and the efficient cause of the world.\nRamanu _g_ a is less exacting. He is at one with Sa _m_ kara in admitting that\nthere can be only one thing real, namely Brahman, but he allows what Sa _m_\nkara strenuously denies, that Brahman possesses attributes. His chief\nattribute, according to Ramanu _g_ a, is thought or intelligence, but he is\nlikewise allowed to possess omnipotence, omniscience, love, and other good\nqualities. He is allowed to possess within himself certain powers ( _s_\naktis), the seeds of plurality, so that both the material objects of our\nexperience and the individual souls ( _g_ ivas) may be considered as real\nmodifications of the real Brahman, and not merely as phenomena or illusions\n(maya). In this modified capacity Brahman is spoken of as \xc3\x8e _s_ vara, the\nLord, and both the thinking ( _k_ it) and the unthinking world (a _k_ it) are\nsupposed to constitute his body. He is then called the Antaryamin, the ruler\nwithin, so that both the objects and the souls which he controls are entitled\nin their individuality to an independent reality, which, as we saw, Sa _m_\nkara boldly denies. Though Ramanu _g_ a also would hardly accept our idea of\ncreation, he teaches evolution or a process by which all that existed\npotentially\n\np. 76\n\nor in a subtile invisible form in the one Brahman, while in its undeveloped\nstate (pralaya), becomes visible, material, objective, and individual in this\nphenomenal world. Could our evolutionists have wished for a better ancestor ?\nTheir phraseology may be different, but what is meant is the same. Ramanu _g_\na distinguishes between Brahman as a cause and Brahman as an effect, but he\nteaches at the same time that cause and effect are always the same, though\nwhat we call cause undergoes pari _n_ ama, i.e. development, in order to\nbecome what we call effect. Instead of holding with Sa _m_ kara that we are\ndeceived about Brahman, that we turn it aside or invert it (vivarta) while\nunder the sway of Nescience, Ramanu _g_ a teaches that Brahman really changes,\nthat what is potential in him at first, becomes real and objective at last.\nAnother important difference between the two is that while Sa _m_ kara's\nhighest goal consists in Brahman recovering itself by knowledge, Ramanu _g_ a\nrecognises the merit of good works, and allows a pure soul to rise by\nsuccessive stages to the world of Brahman, to enjoy there perfect felicity\nwithout fear of new births or of further transmigration. With him, as with us,\nthe soul is really supposed to approach the throne of Brahman, to become like\nBrahman, and participate in all his powers except one, that of creating, that\nis, sending forth the phenomenal world, governing it, and absorbing it again\nwhen the time comes. Thus not only does Ramanu _g_ a, allow individuality to\nindividual souls, but likewise to \xc3\x8e _s_ vara, the Lord, the personal God,\nwhile with Sa _m_ kara a personal god would be as unreal as a personal soul,\nboth becoming real only in their recovered identity.\n\np. 77\n\nWhat Ramanu _g_ a thus represents as the highest truth and as the highest goal\nto be reached by a man seeking for salvation, is not altogether rejected by Sa\n_m_ kara. It is tolerated, but it is looked upon by him as Lower Knowledge,\nthe personal Brahman as the Lower Brahman. That Brahman is called aparam,\nlower, and sagu _n_ am, qualified, and being a merely personal God, he is\noften worshipped by Ramanu _g_ a and his numerous followers, even under such\npopular names as Vish _n_ u or Naraya _n_ a. With Sa _m_ kara that personal \xc3\x8e\n_s_ vara or Lord would be conceived as the pratika, the outward face or\nappearance only, we might almost say as the persona or the \xcf\x80\xcf\x81\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x83\xcf\x89\xcf\x80\xce\xbf\xce\xbd of the\nGodhead, and his worship (upasana), though ignorant, is tolerated and even\nrecommended as practically useful. The Jewish and the Christian idea of God\nwould be in his eyes the same, a pratika or persona of the Godhead. A worship\nof that .God makes the God to be what he is worshipped as (Ved. Sutra III, 4,\n52), and, such as it is, it may lead the pious and virtuous man to eternal\nhappiness. But it is true knowledge alone that can produce eternal salvation,\nthat is, recovered Brahmanhood, and this, even in this life ( _g_ ivan mukti),\nwith freedom from karman (works) and from all further transmigration after\ndeath, in fact with freedom from the law of causality. It seems strange that\nthe followers of these two schools of Vedanta have so long lived in peace and\nharmony together, though differing on what we should consider the most\nessential points, whether of philosophy or religion. The followers of Sa _m_\nkara do not accuse the followers of Ramanu _g_ a of downright error (mithyadar\n_s_ ana), but\n\np. 78\n\nof Nescience only, or of, humanly speaking, inevitable Avidya. Even the\nphenomenal world and the individual souls, though due to Avidya, are not, as\nwe saw, considered as empty or false; they are phenomenal, but have their\nreality in Brahman, if only our eyes, by the withdrawal of Avidya., are opened\nto see the truth. What is phenomenal is not nothing, but is always the\nappearance of that which is and remains real, whether we call it the Brahman,\nthe \xc3\x82tman, the Absolute, the Unknowable, or, in Kantian language, _das Ding an\nsich_. Besides, it is recognised, even by the strictest monists, that for all\npractical purposes (vyavahara) the phenomenal world may be treated as real. It\ncould not even seem to exist (videri) unless it had its real foundation in\nBrahman. The only riddle that remains is Avidya or Nescience, often called\nMaya or illusion. Sa _m_ kara himself will not say that it is or that it is\nnot real. All he can say is that it is there, and that it is the aim of the\nVedanta-philosophy to annihilate it by Vidya, Nescience by science, proving\nthereby, it would seem, that Avidya is not real.\n\nAt first sight this Vedanta-philosophy is, no doubt, startling, but after some\ntime one grows so familiar with it and becomes so fond of it that one wonders\nwhy it should not have been discovered by the philosophers of any other\ncountry. It seems to solve all difficulties but one, to adapt itself to any\nother philosophy, nay, to every kind of religion which does not intrench\nitself behind the ramparts of revelation and miracle. The difficulty is to\nfind a natural approach to it from the position which we occupy in looking at\nphilosophical and religious problems. I tried before to open\n\np. 79\n\none of its doors by asking the question, what is the cause of all things? and\nwe met with the answer that that cause must be one, without a second, because\nthe very presence of a second would limit and condition that which is to be\nunlimited and unconditioned. We saw how, in order to explain what cannot be\ndoubted, namely, the constant changes in the world by which we are surrounded,\nAvidya or Nescience was called in to explain what cannot be denied --the\nvariety of our sensations. It is curious only that what the Greek philosophers\ncalled the logoi, the thoughts or names as archetypes of all phenomenal\nthings, were by the Vedanta treated not as the expressions of Divine Wisdom or\nof Sophia, but as Nama-rupa, names and forms, the result of Nescience or\nAvidya. This Greek conception, apparently the very opposite of that of the\nVedanta, is nevertheless the same, only looked at from a lower and higher\npoint of view. Nama-rupa, names and forms, and Logoi, names and what is named,\nexpress the same idea, namely, that as words are thoughts realised, the whole\ncreation is the word or the expression of eternal thoughts, whether of Brahman\nor of the Godhead, or, in another version, that the world represents the idea\nin its dialectic progress from mere being to the highest manifestations of\nthought. That Brahman can easily be proved to have originally meant word,\nmakes the coincidence between Vedanta, Neo-Platonism, and Christian philosophy\nstill more striking, though it would be hazardous to think of any historical\nconnexion between these ancient conceptions of a rational universe. Lest it\nshould be supposed that I had assimilated the Hindu idea\n\np. 80\n\nof the word, as being with Brahman and becoming the origin of the world, too\nclosely to the Greek conception of the Logos, I subjoin a literal translation\nof a passage in Sa _m_ kara's commentary (p. 96, 1). He holds that Brahman is\npure intelligence, and when the opponent remarks that intelligence is possible\nonly if there are objects of intelligence, he replies: 'As the sun would shine\neven if there were no objects to illuminate, Brahman would be intelligence\neven if there were no objects on which to exercise his intelligence. Such an\nobject, however, exists even before the creation, namely, Nama-rupa, the names\nand forms, as yet undeveloped, but striving for development (avya _k_ _ri_ te,\nvya _k_ ikirshite), that is the words of the Veda living in the mind of the\ncreator even before the creation 1.' Might not this have been written by Plato\nhimself?\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[80:1](rls21.htm#fr_10) See Deussen, Das System des Vedanta, pp. 75, 147.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Gnothi seauton](rls22.htm)\n\n"
