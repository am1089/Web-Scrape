He offers the Vai _s_ vadeva 1 (All-gods' offering); for by means\nof the Vai _s_ vadeva, Pra _g_ apati created abundance (of food) and\ncreatures, thinking, 'May I be consecrated, after creating abundance and\ncreatures!' And in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now, by the Vai _s_\nvadeva, create abundance and creatures, thinking, 'May I be consecrated, after\ncreating abundance and creatures!'\n\n5:2:4:22\\. He then offers the Varu _n_ apraghasa _h_  2; for by means of the\nVaru _n_ apraghasa _h_ Pra _g_ apati delivered the creatures from Varu _n_ a's\nnoose, and those creatures of his were produced healthy and faultless: 'May I\nbe consecrated for healthy, faultless creatures!'\n\np. 48\n\nhe thought. And in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now, by the Varu _n_\napraghasa _h_ , deliver the creatures from Varu _n_ a's noose, and those\ncreatures of his are produced healthy and faultless: 'May I be consecrated for\nhealthy, faultless creatures!' so he thinks.\n\n5:2:4:33\\. He then performs the Sakamedha _h_  1; for by the Sakamedha _h_ the\ngods slew V _ri_ tra, and gained that universal conquest which now is theirs.\nAnd in, like manner does this (Sacrificer) thereby now slay his wicked,\nhateful enemy; and in like manner does he gain the victory, thinking, 'May I\nbe consecrated, when safety and security are gained!'\n\n5:2:4:44\\. He then performs the _S_ unasirya 2, thinking, 'May I be\nconsecrated, having encompassed both essences! Thereupon the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_\navatiya 3 (oblation to the five winds). Having poked the \xc3\x82havaniya fire\nasunder into five parts, he offers, cutting out butter with the dipping-spoon.\n\n5:2:4:55\\. He offers in the forepart (of the fire), with (Va _g_. S. IX, 35),\n'To the Agni-eyed gods, the east-seated, hail!' He then offers in the southern\npart\n\np. 49\n\nwith, 'To the Yama-eyed 1 gods, the south-seated, hail!' He then offers in the\nhind part with, 'To the Vi _s_ vadeva-eyed gods, the west-seated, hail!' He\nthen offers in the northern part with either, 'To the Mitravaru _n_ a-eyed\ngods,--or, To the Marut-eyed gods,--the north-seated, hail!' He then offers in\nthe centre with, 'To the Soma-eyed gods, the above-seated; the venerable,\nhail!'\n\n5:2:4:66\\. Having then poked (the fire) together, he offers with (Va _g_. S.\nIX, 36), 'The gods that are Agni-eyed, east-seated, to them hail!--The gods\nthat are Yama-eyed, south-seated, to them hail!--The gods that are Vi _s_\nvadeva-eyed, west-seated, to them hail!--The gods that are Mitravaru _n_\na-eyed--or, Marut-eyed--north-seated, to them hail!--The gods that are Soma-\neyed, above-seated, venerable, to them hail!' Now as to why he thus offers.\n\n5:2:4:77\\. Now when, by means of the Sakamedha _h_ , the gods were gaining\nthat universal conquest, which now is theirs, they said, 'Verily the fiends,\nthe Rakshas, suck out these (creatures) in the (four) quarters: come, let us\nthrow the thunderbolt at them!' Now the ghee is a thunderbolt: with that\nthunderbolt, the ghee, they smote the fiends, the Rakshas, in the (four)\nquarters, and gained that universal conquest which now is theirs. And in like\nmanner does this (Sacrificer) smite the fiends, the Rakshas, in the quarters,\nby that thunderbolt, the ghee; and thus he gains the victory, thinking, 'May\n\np. 50\n\n[paragraph continues] I be consecrated, when safety and security have been\ngained!'\n\n5:2:4:88\\. And as to why he offers those five latter oblations. Now when they\npoke the \xc3\x82havaniya asunder into five parts, thereby they wound and tear some\nof the fire; and hereby now he heals it: therefore he offers those five latter\noblations.\n\n5:2:4:99\\. For this (offering) a carriage and pair, with a side horse, is the\npriest's fee. Three horses, the warrior, and the charioteer,--these are five\nbreaths, and the breath is the same as the wind: and because that is the fee\nfor this sacrifice, therefore it is called Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ avatiya (belonging to\nthe five winds).\n\n5:2:4:1010\\. He may also heal (some disease 1) with this (offering): For\nyonder blower (or purifier, the wind) is this breath; and the breath is the\nsame as the vital energy. Now he (the wind) blows as one only, but on entering\ninto man, he is divided tenfold; and ten are those oblations he offers: thus\nhe (the priest) endows him with the ten vital airs, with the whole, entire\nvital energy; and were he now even as one whose vital spirit has departed,\nverily by this (offering) he (the priest) brings him round again.\n\n5:2:4:1111\\. Thereupon the Indraturiya 2.--There is a cake on eight potsherds\nfor Agni, a barley pap for Varu _n_ a, a pap of gavedhuka seed (coix barbata)\nfor Rudra; and a mess of sour curds from a yoke-trained\n\np. 51\n\ncow for Indra: this Indraturiya he offers. Now Indra and Agni on that occasion\nconsulted with each other: 'Verily the fiends, the Rakshas, suck out these\n(creatures) in the (four) quarters: come, let us throw the thunderbolt at\nthem!'\n\n5:2:4:1212\\. Agni then spake, 'Let there be three shares for me, one for\nthee!'--'So be it!'--By that offering those two smote the fiends, the Rakshas,\nin the (four) quarters, and gained that universal conquest which now is\ntheirs. And in like manner does this (Sacrificer) by that offering smite the\nfiends, the Rakshas, in the quarters; and gain the victory, thinking, 'May I\nbe consecrated, when safety and security have been gained!'\n\n5:2:4:1313\\. Now what cake on eight potsherds there is for Agni, that is one\nof Agni's shares; and what barley pap there is for Varu _n_ a--Varu _n_ a\nbeing the same as Agni--that is Agni's second share; and what pap of gavedhuka\nseed there is for Rudra--Rudra being the same as Agni--that is Agni's third\nshare. And as to why it is prepared of gavedhuka seed: that god surely is (the\nrecipient) of refuse (remains of offering) 1, and gavedhuka grass is refuse,--\nhence it is prepared of gavedhuka seed. And what mess of sour curds there is\nfrom a yoke-trained cow for Indra, that is the fourth share (being that) of\nIndra--turiya being the same as _k_ aturtha (fourth)--hence the name\nIndraturiya. That same yoke-trained cow is the fee for this (offering); for by\nher shoulder she is of Agni's nature, since her shoulder is, as it were, fire-\nburnt; and in that, being a female, she improperly draws (the cart), that is\nher Varu _n_ ic\n\np. 52\n\nnature; and in that she is a cow, she is of Rudra's nature 1; and in that\nIndra's sour curds (come) from her, thereby she is of Indra's nature. Indeed\nthat (cow) commands all that: therefore that same yoke-trained cow is the fee.\n\n5:2:4:1414\\. Thereupon he performs the Apamargahoma; for by means of apamarga\nplants (achyranthes aspera) the gods wiped away (apa-mar _g_ ) the fiends, the\nRakshas, in the quarters, and gained that universal conquest which now is\ntheirs. And in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now by means of apamarga\nplants wipe away the fiends, the Rakshas, in the quarters; and in like manner\ndoes he gain the victory, thinking, 'May I be consecrated, when safety and\nsecurity have been gained!'\n\n5:2:4:1515\\. He takes apamarga grains in a dipping-spoon of either pala _s_ a\n(butea frondosa) or vika\xe1\xb9\x85kata (flacourtia sapida) wood. They take a firebrand\nfrom the Anvaharyapa _k_ ana (southern) fire; and proceed therewith eastward\nor northward; and there having made up a fire he offers.\n\n5:2:4:1616\\. He takes the firebrand with (Va _g_. S. IX, 37; _Ri_ k S. III,\n24, 1), 'Encounter the arrays, Agni!'--arrays means battles: 'encounter the\nbattles!' he thereby says;--'Repel the evil-wisher!'--the evil-wisher is the\nenemy: 'beat off the enemy!' he thereby says;--'Unconquerable, conquering the\nevil-doers!'--unconquerable he is indeed, by the Rakshas, the fiends; and\nconquering the evil-doers, for he conquers every evil:\n\np. 53\n\ntherefore he says, 'conquering the evil-doers;'--'Bestow glory upon the\nofferer of sacrifice!'--'bestowing blessing on the Sacrificer,' is what he\nthereby says.\n\n5:2:4:1717\\. Thereupon making up the fire he offers with (Va _g_. S. IX, 38),\n'At the impulse of the God Savit _ri_ I offer with the arms of the A _s_ vins,\nwith the hands of Pushan, with the strength of the Upa _m_ _s_ u!' for the Upa\n_m_ _s_ u 1 (cup of Soma) is the mouth (or opening) of the sacrifice: thus he\nslays the fiends, the Rakshas, by the mouth of the sacrifice;--'Slain is the\nRakshas, hail!' thus he slays the fiends, the Rakshas.\n\n5:2:4:1818\\. If the dipping-spoon is of pala _s_ a wood,--the pala _s_ a being\nthe Brahman--it is with the Brahman that he slays the fiends, the Rakshas; and\nif it is of vika\xe1\xb9\x85kata wood,--the vika\xe1\xb9\x85kata being the thunderbolt--it is with\nthe thunderbolt that the slays the fiends, the Rakshas: 'For the slaughter of\nthe Rakshas (I take) thee!' therewith he slays the fiends, the Rakshas.\n\n5:2:4:1919\\. If he offers after going eastward, he throws the spoon towards\nthe east; and if he offers after going northward, he throws the spoon towards\nthe north, with, 'We have slain the Rakshas!' thus he slays the fiends, the\nRakshas.\n\n5:2:4:2020\\. Thereupon they return (to the sacrificial ground) without looking\nback. Now by this (ceremony) also he may make for himself a counter-charm 2.\nIn whatever direction from there (his evil-wisher) is,\n\np. 54\n\nlooking back thither he offers; for the Apamarga is of a backward effect:\nwhosoever does anything to him there, him indeed he thereby pitches backward.\nLet him indicate the name of that one, saying, 'We have slain so and so! So\nand so is slain!' thus he slays the fiends, the Rakshas.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[47:1](sbe4111.htm#fr_109) This, the first of the Seasonal offerings, is to be\nperformed on the full-moon of Phalguni, the other three then following after\nintervals of four months each. During these intervals the ordinary Fortnightly\nsacrifices are to be performed from day to day in this way that either the\nFull-moon and New-moon sacrifice are performed on alternate days, or the\nformer on each day of the bright fortnights, and the latter on each day of the\ndark fortnights. Thus, according to \xc3\x82 _s_ v. Sr. IX, 3, 6; while Katy. XV, 1,\n18 allows only the latter mode. The final Seasonal offering, or _S_ unasirya,\nwhich ordinarily is performed a twelvemonth after the Vai _s_ vadeva, or on\nthe full-moon of Phalguna, is on the present occasion to be performed just a\nyear after the opening sacrifice, or Pavitra ([p. 42](sbe4110.htm#page_42),\nnote [1](sbe4110.htm#fn_98)), i.e. on the first day of the bright fortnight of\nPhalguna, being immediately followed by the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ avatiya.\n\n[47:2](sbe4111.htm#fr_110) See part i, p. 391 seq.\n\n[48:1](sbe4111.htm#fr_111) See part i, p. 408 seq.\n\n[48:2](sbe4111.htm#fr_112) See part i, p. 444 seq., where the word is\nfancifully explained as composed of _s_ una (prosperity) and sira (= sara,\nsap),--the two essences here referred to. Saya _n_ a, following Yaska (and _S_\nat. Br. II, 6, 3, 6-8?), identifies the two component elements with Vayu, the\nwind, and \xc3\x82ditya, the sun; see part i, p. 445, note 3.\n\n[48:3](sbe4111.htm#fr_113) The authorities of the Black Ya _g_ us (Taitt. Br.\nI, 7, 1, 5) call this oblation Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ avattiya, i.e. 'consisting of\nfivefold cut (or ladled)' ghee, which is offered without disturbing the fire.\nPrior to this oblation, \xc3\x82pastamba (Taitt. S., vol. ii, p. 93), however,\nprescribes a so-called Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ edhmiya, i.e. an oblation 'on five\nfirebrands,' the fire being, as here, poked about so as to form separate heaps\nin the four quarters and in the centre.\n\n[49:1](sbe4111.htm#fr_114) Yama is the ruler of the departed ancestors,\nresiding in the southern quarter.\n\n[50:1](sbe4111.htm#fr_115) Tenapy etena vish _t_ avra _g_ e (v. l. vish _t_\nabrage) bhisha _g_ yet. [Ka _n_ va](errata.htm#8) rec.\n\n[50:2](sbe4111.htm#fr_116) That is, the ceremony in which the fourth oblation\nbelongs to Indra. While the Madhyandinas perform this ceremony on the same day\n(the pratipad of the bright fortnight of Phalguni), the Ka _n_ vas do so on\nthe following day; the Apamargahoma being then likewise shifted on another\nday.\n\n[51:1](sbe4111.htm#fr_117) On Rudra's epithet vastavya, see I, 7, 3, 1, 8.\n\n[52:1](sbe4111.htm#fr_118) Rudra rules over the beasts (III, 6; 2, 20), whence\nhe is also called the lord of beasts (pa _s_ unam pati, I, 7, 3, 8; Pa _s_\nupati [V, 3, 3, 7](sbe4115.htm#5:3:3:7)). Pushan, the genius of thrift and\nprosperity, is also (like the Greek Pan) regarded as the protector of cattle:\nsee [V, 2, 5, 8](sbe4112.htm#5:2:5:8).\n\n[53:1](sbe4111.htm#fr_119) See part ii, p. 248.\n\n[53:2](sbe4111.htm#fr_120) Viz. an amulet consisting of a band running back\ninto itself. The Ka _n_ va text has,--Tena hapy etena vish _t_ avra _g_ e\npratisara _m_ kurvita.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 2, 5. Fifth Brahma _n_ a](sbe4112.htm)\n\n"
