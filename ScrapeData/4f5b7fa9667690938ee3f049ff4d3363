Having produced creatures, and\nrun the whole race, he became relaxed 1. From him, when relaxed, the vital air\nwent out from within: then his vigour went out of him. That having gone out,\nhe fell down. From him, thus fallen, food flowed forth: it was from that eye\non which he lay that his food flowed. And, verily, there teas then no firm\nfoundation whatever here.\n\n7:1:2:22\\. The gods spake, \'Verily, there is no other foundation than this:\nlet us restore even him, our father Pra _g_ apati; he shall be our\nfoundation.\'\n\n7:1:2:33\\. They said unto Agni, \'Verily, there is no foundation other than\nthis: in thee we will restore this our father Pra _g_ apati; he shall be our\nfoundation.\'--\'What will then be my reward?\' said he.\n\n7:1:2:44\\. They spake, \'This Pra _g_ apati is food: with thee for our mouth we\nwill eat that food, and he (Pra _g_ apati) shall be the food of us, having\nthee for our month.\' He said, \'So be it!\' Therefore the gods eat food with\nAgni as their mouth; for to whatsoever deity men offer, it is into Agni that\nthey offer, since it is with Agni for their mouth that the gods thus took in\nthe food.\n\n7:1:2:55\\. Now the vital air which went out from within him is no other than\nthe wind that blows yonder; and the vigour which went out of him is yonder\nsun; and the food which flowed from him is all the food which there is within\nthe year.\n\n7:1:2:66\\. The gods heated him in the fire; and when the\n\np. 313\n\nfire rose over him thus heated, that same vital air which had gone out from\nwithin him came back to him, and they put it into him; and the vigour which\nhad gone out of him they put into him; and the food which had flowed from him\nthey put into him. Having made him up entire and complete, they raised him (so\nas to stand) upright; and inasmuch as they thus raised him upright he is these\nworlds.\n\n7:1:2:77\\. This (terrestrial) world truly is his foundation; and what fire\nthere is in this world that is his (Pra _g_ apati\'s) downward vital air. And\nthe air is his body, and what wind there is in the air, that is that vital air\nof his in the body. And the sky is his head; the sun and the moon are his\neyes. The eye on which he lay is the moon: whence that one is much closed up,\nfor the food flowed therefrom.\n\n7:1:2:88\\. Now that same foundation which the gods thus restored is the\nfoundation here even to this day, and will be so even hereafter.\n\n7:1:2:99\\. And the Pra _g_ apati who became relaxed is this same Agni who is\nnow being built up. And when that fire-pan lies there empty before being\nheated, it is just like Pra _g_ apati, as he lay there with the vital air and\nthe vigour gone out of him, and the food having flowed out.\n\n7:1:2:1010\\. He heats it on the fire, even as the gods then heated him (Pra\n_g_ apati). And when the fire rises over it thus heated, then that same vital\nair which went out from within him comes back to him, and he puts it into him.\nAnd when, putting on the gold plate, he wears it, he puts into him that very\nvigour which had gone out of him. And when he puts on kindling-sticks, he puts\ninto him that very food which had flowed from him.\n\np. 314\n\n7:1:2:1111\\. He puts them on in the evening and morning, for the food both of\nthe day and the night was flowing out. These same (ceremonies) should be\n(performed) during a whole year, for that Pra _g_ apati whence those\n(substances) went out is the year: into that whole (Pra _g_ apati) he thus\nputs all that (which belongs to him). And in whatever part of this (year) he\nshould therefore 1 not do so, into that part of him (Pra _g_ apati) he would\nnot put that (which belongs therein). \'One must not even be a looker-on at the\n(building up of a fire) not carried about for a year,\' Vamakakshaya _n_ a was\nwont to say, \'lest he should see this our father Pra _g_ apati being torn to\npieces 2.\' He restores him so as to be whole and complete, and raises him to\nstand upright, even as the gods then raised him.\n\n7:1:2:1212\\. This (terrestrial) world in truth is his (Pra _g_ apati\'s)\nGarhapatya (hearth); and what fire there is in this world that to him is the\nfire on the Garhapatya. And what space there is between the \xc3\x82havaniya and the\nGarhapatya, that is the air 3; and that wind in\n\np. 315\n\nthe air is for him the fire on the \xc3\x82gnidhriya. The sky is his \xc3\x82havaniya\n(hearth), and those two, the sun and the moon, are the fire on the \xc3\x82havaniya.\nThis then is indeed his own self 1.\n\n7:1:2:1313\\. The \xc3\x82havaniya truly is his head; and the fire which is on the\n\xc3\x82havaniya is that vital air of his in the head. And as to why it (the\n\xc3\x82havaniya) has wings and tail, it is because that vital air in the head has\nwings and tail 2;--the eye is its head, the right ear its right wing, the left\near its left wing, the vital air its central body 3, and the voice is the tail\n(and) the foundation (the feet): inasmuch as the vital airs subsist by eating\nfood with speech (voice) 4, the voice is the tail, the foundation.\n\n7:1:2:1414\\. And what space there is between the \xc3\x82havaniya and Garhapatya,\nthat is the body (trunk); and the fire on the \xc3\x82gnidhriya is to him that vital\nair inside the body. The Garhapatya is his foundation; and the fire on the\nGarhapatya is his downward vital air.\n\n7:1:2:1515\\. Now some build it (the Garhapatya) in three layers, saying,\n\'There are here three downward vital airs.\' Let him not do so: they who do so\ndo what is excessive,--one amounting to twenty-one, one amounting to the Anush\n_t_ ubh, and one amounting to the B _ri_ hati; for this (altar) is of one\nsingle form--a\n\np. 316\n\nwomb. And as to those downward vital airs, they are indeed a bringing forth,\nfor even the urine and faeces he voids are \'brought forth.\'\n\n7:1:2:1616\\. Now then the (mystic) correspondence,--twenty-one bricks, nine\nformulas 1, that makes thirty;--and the \'settling\' and Sudadohas verse, that\nmakes thirty-two,--the anush _t_ ubh verse consists of thirty-two syllables:\nthis is an anush _t_ ubh 2.\n\n7:1:2:1717\\. And, again, there are twenty-one enclosing-stones; the formula\nthe twenty-second; the formula for the sweeping, the saline earth and its\nformula, the sand and its formula, the filling (soil) and its formula; with\nfour (formulas) he pours (the two fires) together; with a fifth he unties (the\npan); then this (Nir _ri_ ti) with three 3,--the anush _t_ ubh verse consists\nof thirty-two syllables: this then is an anush _t_ ubh.\n\n7:1:2:1818\\. Then there are these two formulas 4, and they are indeed an anush\n_t_ ubh--the Anush _t_ ubh is speech: thus what twofold form of speech there\nis, the divine and the human, loud and low, that is those two.\n\n7:1:2:1919\\. The Garhapatya pile thus is those three\n\np. 317\n\nanush _t_ ubh verses. And as to why they make up three anush _t_ ubhs in this\n(Garhapatya), it is because all these (three) worlds then come to be\n(contained) therein. From it they take one of the two (first) anush _t_ ubhs\nof thirty-two syllables (to be) the \xc3\x82havaniya,--that \xc3\x82havaniya is that sky,\nthat head (of Pra _g_ apati). Then one of the two (anush _t_ ubhs) is left\nhere (to be) this Garhapatya, this foundation, this very (terrestrial) world.\n\n7:1:2:2020\\. And as to those two formulas, they are that space between the\n\xc3\x82havaniya and the Garhapatya, that air (-world), that body (of Pra _g_ apati).\nAnd because there are two of them (making up one anush _t_ ubh), therefore\nthat space (and hearth) between the \xc3\x82havaniya and the Garhapatya (viz. the\n\xc3\x82gnidhriya hearth 1) is smaller; and therefore the air-world is the smallest\nof these worlds.\n\n7:1:2:2121\\. That same Anush _t_ ubh, speech, is threefold. That fire, taking\nthe form of the vital air, goes along with it (speech),--the fire which is on\nthe \xc3\x82havaniya (altar) is the out-breathing, and yonder sun; and the fire which\nis on the \xc3\x82gnidhriya is the through-breathing, and the wind which blows\nyonder; and the fire which is on the Garhapatya is the in-breathing, and what\nfire there is here in this (earth-) world. And verily he who knows this makes\nup for himself the whole Va _k_ (speech), the whole vital air, the whole body\n(of Pra _g_ apati).\n\np. 318\n\n7:1:2:2222\\. Then that B _ri_ hati (metre),--the two (verses) of thirty-two\nsyllables: that makes thirty-two; then those two formulas: that makes thirty-\nfour; Agni the thirty-fifth;--a metre does not vanish by a syllable (too much\nor too little), neither by one nor by two 1;--moreover, that (Agni) consists\nof two syllables: that makes thirty-six. The B _ri_ hati consists of thirty-\nsix syllables,--it is the B _ri_ hati that that (\xc3\x82havaniya) pile thus amounts\nto; for whatlike the seed which is infused into the womb, suchlike (offspring)\nis born therefrom: thus in that he makes up that B _ri_ hati (metre) in this\n(Garhapatya hearth), thereby that (\xc3\x82havaniya) fire-altar amounts to the B _ri_\nhati.\n\n7:1:2:2323\\. As to this they say, \'As the Garhapatya is this (terrestrial)\nworld, the Dhish _n_ ya hearths the air, and the \xc3\x82havaniya the sky, and the\nair-world is not separated from this (earth-) world, why then, after building\nthe Garhapatya, does he build the \xc3\x82havaniya, and (only) then the Dhish _n_\nyas?\' Well, at first these two worlds (heaven and earth) were together; and\nwhen they parted asunder, the space which was between (antar) them became that\nair (antariksha); for \'iksha 2\' indeed it was theretofore, and \'Now this\n"iksha" has come between (antara),\' they said, whence \'antariksha\' (air). And\nas to why, after building the Garhapatya, he builds the \xc3\x82havaniya, it is\nbecause these two worlds were created first. Then, going back, he throws up\nthe Dhish _n_ ya hearths, just to prevent discontinuity of\n\np. 319\n\nthe sacred work; and thus indeed the middle is completed, after the two ends\nhave been completed.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[312:1](sbe4156.htm#fr_595) Literally, fallen asunder, i.e. broken to pieces,\nor disjointed (\'opened,\' Delbruck, Synt. F.

That is,\nhe is not to place him (Pra _g_ apati) in an upright position, until he has\nbeen completely restored. The particular form of the participle qualifying Pra\n_g_ apati (vi _kh_ idyamana) might seem to favour the former alternative; see,\nhowever, [paragraph 23](sbe4156.htm#7:1:2:23), antayo _h_ sa _m_ skriyama _n_\nayor, \'after the two ends have been perfected.\'\n\n[314:3](sbe4156.htm#fr_598) In this and the following paragraphs the ordinary\nposition of subject and predicate seems often reversed: in the present case\none would expect--that air is to him the space between the two fires.\n\n[315:1](sbe4156.htm#fr_599) Viz. the sacrificial ground thus becomes identical\nwith the universe, i.e. with Pra _g_ apati.\n\n[315:2](sbe4156.htm#fr_600) That is, it is (like) a bird. The word \'pra _n_ a\'\nmight almost be rendered here by \'the living being.\'\n\n[315:3](sbe4156.htm#fr_601) In the text this is reversed, the head is the eye,\nthe right wing the right ear, the left wing the left ear, the central body the\nvital air, which can scarcely be the construction intended by the author.\n\n[315:4](sbe4156.htm#fr_602) Or, with the mouth. In VIII, 5, 4, 1; X, 5, 2, 15,\n\'va _k_ \' is identified with the tongue.\n\n[316:1](sbe4156.htm#fr_603) Viz. XII, 47-54 (XII, 53, consisting of two\nformulas).\n\n[316:2](sbe4156.htm#fr_604) That is to say, these thirty-two items form, as it\nwere, an Anush _t_ ubh verse consisting of thirty-two syllables.\n\n[316:3](sbe4156.htm#fr_605) See [VII, 2, 1, 1](sbe4157.htm#7:2:1:1) seq.\n\n[316:4](sbe4156.htm#fr_606) I do not see what other formulas can be intended\nhere except those addressed to the enclosing stones, concluding with the\nsadana,\' or \'settling\' formula, viz. Va _g_. S. XII, 53; see above, [VII, 1,\n1, 30](sbe4155.htm#7:1:1:30); though these do not exactly yield thirty-two\nsyllables, but thirty-four (see, however, [paragraph\n22](sbe4156.htm#7:1:2:22)). Our available MSS. of the commentary are\nunfortunately defective at this place.--On the artificial manipulation of\nmaking up imaginary metres by the mere number of syllables, irrespective of\ntheir real prosodic value, see Professor Weber, Ind. Stud., VIII, p. 23 seq.\n\n[317:1](sbe4156.htm#fr_607) Or, the Dhish _n_ ya hearths (see [paragraph\n23](sbe4156.htm#7:1:2:23)), which are more properly situated between the\nGarhapatya and the \xc3\x82havaniya fireplaces. See the plan of the sacrificial\nground in part ii; where, however, the \xc3\x82havaniya of the Pra _k_ inava _m_ _s_\na (hall), or the so-called _s_ aladvarya (hall-door fire), would represent the\nGarhapatya for the \xc3\x82havaniya of the Mahavedi.\n\n[318:1](sbe4156.htm#fr_608) The same latitude in the computation of the number\nof syllables constituting a metre is conceded, Ait.
