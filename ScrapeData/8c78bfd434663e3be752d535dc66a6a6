XIII.\n\nKrishn\xcc\x81a praised by the cowherds: his sports with the Gopis: their imitation\nand love of hire. The Rasa dance.\n\nAFTER \xc5\x9aakra had departed, the cowherds said to Krishn\xcc\x81a, whom they had seen\nholding up Govarddhana, "We have been preserved, together with our cattle,\nfrom a great peril, by your supporting the mountain above us; but this is very\nastonishing child\'s play, unsuitable to the condition of a herdsman, and all\nthy actions are those of a god. Tell us what is the meaning of all this.\nKaliya has been conquered in the lake; Pralamba has been killed; Govarddhana\nhas been lifted up: our minds are filled with amazement. Assuredly we repose\nat the feet of Hari, O thou of unbounded might! for, having witnessed thy\npower, we cannot believe thee to be a man. Thy affection, Ke\xc5\x9bava, for our\nwomen and children, and for Vraja; the deeds that thou hast wrought, which all\nthe gods would have attempted in vain; thy boyhood, and thy prowess; thy\nhumiliating birth amongst us; are contradictions that fill us with doubt,\nwhenever we think of them. Yet reverence be to thee, whether thou be a god, or\na demon, or a Yaksha, or a Gandharba, or whatever we may deem thee; for thou\nart our friend." When they had ended, Krishn\xcc\x81a remained silent for some time,\nas if hurt and offended, and then replied to them, "Herdsmen, if you are not\nashamed of my relationship; if I have merited your praise; what occasion is\nthere for you to engage in any discussion concerning me? If you have any\nregard for me; if I have deserved your praise; then be satisfied to know that\nI am your kinsman. I am neither god, nor Yaksha, nor Gandharba, nor Danava; I\nhave been born your relative, and you must not think differently of me." Upon\nreceiving this answer, the Gopas held their peace, and went into the woods,\nleaving Krishn\xcc\x81a apparently displeased.\n\nBut Krishn\xcc\x81a, observing the clear sky bright with the autumnal moon, and the\nair perfumed with the fragrance of the wild water-lily, in whose buds the\nclustering bees were murmuring their songs, felt inclined to join with the\nGopis in sport. Accordingly he and Rama commenced\n\np. 532\n\nsinging sweet low strains in various measures, such as the women loved; and\nthey, as soon as they heard the melody, quitted their homes, and hastened to\nmeet the foe of Madhu. One damsel gently sang an accompaniment to his song;\nanother attentively listened to his melody: one calling out upon his name,\nthen shrunk abashed; whilst another, more bold, and instigated by affection,\npressed close to his side: one, as she sallied forth, beheld some of the\nseniors of the family, and dared not venture, contenting herself with\nmeditating on Krishn\xcc\x81a with closed eyes, and entire devotion, by which\nimmediately all acts of merit were effaced by rapture, and all sin was\nexpiated by regret at not beholding him: and others, again, reflecting upon\nthe cause of the world, in the form of the supreme Brahma, obtained by their\nsighing final emancipation. Thus surrounded by the Gopis, Krishn\xcc\x81a thought the\nlovely moonlight night of autumn propitious to the Rasa dance 1. Many of the\nGopis imitated the different actions of Krishn\xcc\x81a, and in his absence wandered\nthrough Vrindavan, representing his person. "I am Krishn\xcc\x81a," cries one;\n"behold the elegance of my movements." "I am Krishn\xcc\x81a," exclaims another;\n"listen to my song." "Vile Kaliya, stay! for I am Krishn\xcc\x81a," is repeated by a\nthird, slapping her arms in defiance. A fourth calls out, "Herdsmen, fear\nnothing; be steady; the danger of the storm is over, for, lo, I lift up\nGovarddhana for your shelter." And a fifth proclaims, "Now let the herds graze\nwhere they will, for I have destroyed Dhenuka." Thus in various actions of\nKrishn\xcc\x81a the Gopis imitated him, whilst away, and beguiled their sorrow by\nmimicking his sports. Looking down upon the ground, one damsel calls to her\nfriend, as the light down upon her body stands erect with joy, and the lotuses\nof her eyes expand, "See here are the marks of Krishn\xcc\x81a\'s feet, as he has gone\nalone sportively, and left the impressions of the banner, fife thunderbolt,\nand the goad 2. What lovely maiden has been his companion, inebriate with\n\np. 533\n\npassion, as her irregular footmarks testify? Here Damodara has gathered\nflowers from on high, for we see alone the impressions of the tips of his\nfeet. Here a nymph has sat down with him, ornamented with flowers, fortunate\nin having propitiated Vishn\xcc\x81u in a prior existence. Having left her in an\narrogant mood, because he had offered her flowers, the son of Nanda has gone\nby this road; for see, unable to follow him with equal steps, his associate\nhas here tripped along upon her toes, and, holding his hand, the damsel has\npassed, as is evident from the uneven and intermingled footsteps. But the\nrogue has merely taken her hand, and left her neglected, for here the paces\nindicate the path of a person in despair. Undoubtedly he promised that he\nwould quickly come again, for here are his own footsteps returning with speed.\nHere he has entered the thick forest, impervious to the rays of the moon, and\nhis steps can be traced no farther." Hopeless then of beholding Krishn\xcc\x81a, the\nGopis returned, and repaired to the banks of the Yamuna, where they sang his\nsongs; and presently they beheld the preserver of the three worlds, with a\nsmiling aspect, hastening towards them: on which, one exclaimed, "Krishn\xcc\x81a!\nKrishn\xcc\x81a!" unable to articulate any thing else: another affected to contract\nher forehead with frowns, as drinking with the bees of her eyes the lotus of\nthe face of Hari: another, closing her eyelids, contemplated internally his\nform, as if engaged in an act of devotion. Then Madhava, coming amongst them,\nconciliated some with soft speeches, some with gentle looks, and some he took\nby the hand; and the illustrious deity sported with them in the stations of\nthe dance. As each of the Gopis, however, attempted to keep in one place,\nclose to the side of Krishn\xcc\x81a, the circle of the dance could not be\nconstructed, and he therefore took each by the hand, and when their eyelids\nwere shut by the effects of such touch, the circle was formed 3. Then\nproceeded the dance\n\np. 534\n\nto the music of their clashing bracelets, and songs that celebrated in\nsuitable strain the charms of the autumnal season. Krishn\xcc\x81a sang the\n\np. 535\n\nmoon of autumn, a mine of gentle radiance; but the nymphs repeated the praises\nof Krishn\xcc\x81a alone. At times, one of them, wearied by the revolving dance,\nthrew her arms, ornamented with tinkling bracelets, round the neck of the\ndestroyer of Madhu: another, skilled in the art of singing his praises,\nembraced him. The drops of perspiration from the arms of Hari were like\nfertilizing rain, which produced a crop of down upon the temples of the Gopis.\nKrishn\xcc\x81a sang the strain that was appropriate to the dance. The Gopis\nrepeatedly exclaimed, "Bravo, Krishn\xcc\x81a!" to his song. When leading, they\nfollowed him; when returning, they encountered him; and, whether he went\nforwards or backwards, they ever attended on his steps. Whilst frolicking thus\nwith the Gopis, they considered every instant without him a myriad of years;\nand, prohibited in vain by husbands, fathers, brothers, they went forth at\nnight to sport with Krishn\xcc\x81a, the object of their affection. Thus the\nillimitable being, the benevolent remover of all imperfections, assumed the\ncharacter of a youth amongst the females of the herdsmen of Vraja; pervading\ntheir natures, and that of their lords, by his own essence, all diffusive like\nthe wind: for even as in all creatures the elements of ether, fire, earth,\nwater, and air, are comprehended, so also is he every where present, and in\nall.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[532:1](vp130.htm#fr_1493) The Rasa dance is danced by men and women, holding\neach other\'s hands, and going round in a circle, singing the airs to which\nthey dance. According to Bharata, the airs are various both in melody and\ntime, and the number of persons should not exceed sixty-four.\n\n[532:2](vp130.htm#fr_1494) The soles of the feet of a deity are p. 533 usually\nmarked by a variety of emblematical figures: this is carried to the greatest\nextravagance by the Buddhists, the marks on the feet of Gautama being 130: see\nTrans. R. As. Soc. III. 70. It is a decoration very moderately employed by the\nHindus.\n\n[533:3](vp130.htm#fr_1495) This is a rather inexplicit statement, but the\ncomment makes it clear. Krishn\xcc\x81a, it is said, in order to form the circle,\ntakes each damsel by the hand, and leads her to her place: there he quits her;\nbut the effect of the contact is such, that it deprives her of the power of\nperception, and p. 534 she contentedly takes the hand of her female neighbour,\nthinking it to be Krishn\xcc\x81a\'s. The Bhagavata is bolder, and asserts that\nKrishn\xcc\x81a multiplied himself, and actually stood between each two damsels: \'The\nRasa dance, formed of a circle graced by the Gopis, was then led off by the\nlord of magic, Krishn\xcc\x81a having placed himself in the midst of every two of the\nnymphs.\' The Hari Van\xc5\x9ba intimates the same, though not very fully: \'Then all\nthe nymphs of the cowherds, placing themselves in couples in a row, engaged in\npleasant diversion, singing the deeds of Krishn\xcc\x81a.\' The Pankti, or row, is\nsaid by the commentator to mean here, the Man\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ala, or ring; and the couples\'\nto imply that Krishn\xcc\x81a was between every two. He quotes a verse to this effect\nfrom some other Vaishn\xcc\x81ava work: \'Between each two damsels was Madhava, and\nbetween each two Madhavas was a nymph; and the son of Devaki played on the\nflute:\' for, in fact, Krishn\xcc\x81a is not only dancing with each, but also by\nhimself in the centre; for this the commentator on the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba cites a\npassage from the Vedas: ###. Literally, \'The many-formed (being) assumes\n(various) bodies. One form stood apart, occupying triple observance.\' Now if\nthe verse be genuine, it probably refers to something that has little to do\nwith Krishn\xcc\x81a; but it is explained to apply to the Rasa; the form of Krishn\xcc\x81a\nbeing supposed to be meant, as wholly distinct from the Gopis, and yet being\nbeheld by every one of them, on each side and in front of her. In the\nmeditation upon Krishn\xcc\x81a, which is enjoined in the Brahma Vaivartta, he is to\nbe contemplated in the centre of the Rasa Man\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ala, in association with his\nfavourite Radha; but the Man\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ala described in that work is not a ring of\ndancers, but a circle of definite space at Vrindavana, within which Krishn\xcc\x81a,\nRadha, and the Gopis divert themselves, not very decorously. This work has\nprobably given the tone to the style in which the annual festival, the Rasa\nYatra, is celebrated in various parts of India, in the month of Kartika, upon\nthe sun\'s entrance into Libra, by nocturnal dances, and representations of the\nsports of Krishn\xcc\x81a. A circular dance of men and women, however, does not form\nany prominent feature at these entertainments, and it may be doubted if it is\never performed. Some of the earliest labourers in the field of Hindu mythology\nhave thought this circular dance to typify the dance of the planets round the\nsun (Maurice, Ancient History of Hindus, I. 108. II. 356); but there is no\nparticular number assigned to the performers by any of the Hindu authorities,\nbeyond its limitation to sixty-four. At the Rasa Mandala of the Brahma\nVaivartta, Radha is accompanied by thirty-six of her most particular friends\namongst the Gopis, but they are each attended by thousands of inferior\npersonages, and none p. 535 of the crowd are left without male multiples of\nKrishn\xcc\x81a. The only mysticism hinted at in that Puran\xcc\x81a, is, that these are all\none with Krishn\xcc\x81a: the varied vital conditions of one spirit being represented\nby the Gopis and the illusory manifestations of Krishn\xcc\x81a: he himself being\nsupreme unmodified soul.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XIV](vp131.htm)\n\n'
