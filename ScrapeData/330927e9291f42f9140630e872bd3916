And on account of its general deficiency in probability.\n\nNo further special discussion is in fact required. From\n\np. 428\n\nwhatever new points of view the Bauddha system is tested with reference to its\nprobability, it gives way on all sides, like the walls of a well dug in sandy\nsoil. It has, in fact, no foundation whatever to rest upon, and hence the\nattempts to use it as a guide in the practical concerns of life are mere\nfolly.--Moreover, Buddha by propounding the three mutually contradictory\nsystems, teaching respectively the reality of the external world, the reality\nof ideas only, and general nothingness, has himself made it clear either that\nhe was a man given to make incoherent assertions, or else that hatred of all\nbeings induced him to propound absurd doctrines by accepting which they would\nbecome thoroughly confused.--So that--and this the Sutra means to indicate--\nBuddha's doctrine has to be entirely disregarded by all those who have a\nregard for their own happiness.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 33](sbe34209.htm)\n\n"
