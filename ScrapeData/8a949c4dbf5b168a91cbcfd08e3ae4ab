Unicode is a multi-byte alphabet which can represent all major world\nscripts, and many obscure ones as well. This solves a major problem for\ncreators of etexts, as it is now possible to fully transcribe texts in\nmultiple languages without requiring ASCII transliterations, special fonts or\nbrowsing software. Unicode enabling also takes care of right-to-left scripts\nmore-or-less automatically.\n\nAll modern web browsers support Unicode if you have a decent Unicode font\ninstalled, provided you designate that font as your default font.\n\nThat said, this is definitely still on the cutting edge, and you may need to\ntweak your browser settings to get the full character set. And there are some\nfeatures which are buggy in particular browsers, although support seems to be\ngetting better in newer versions; having an up-to-date version of your\noperating system also helps.\n\nFor instance, some browsers have a few problems displaying some subscript and\nsuperscript characters such as Hebrew vowel points (they get displayed to the\nleft of where they should be, with a space above them). Some older versions of\nInternet Explorer do not display medial and final forms when displaying Arabic\n(which makes it unusable for this purpose). Firefox 3, on Windows XP, with\nCode2000 doesn't display the entire Quran character set, particularly some\nmore obscure ones. IE8 on Windows XP, with Code2000 renders all but three of\nthe archaic Quranic characters correctly. We haven't tested every\nbrowser/OS/font combination. For this reason, we have also posted [a version\nof the Quran which uses gif images to display Arabic](isl/quran/index.htm).\nBut this is an exception. And this may have been fixed in more recent versions\nof the browser.\n\nIt appears that Firefox does not render Devanagari 'i' correctly: it places it\nafter the associated consonant, not before.\n\nIE and Safari do not display the correct presentation forms for Unicode\nCyrillic italics: Safari does not even allow Cyrillic to be italicized,\nwhereas IE shows italicized forms of the base graphemes, which is incorrect.\nOpera and Firefox display these presentation forms correctly. Strangely\nenough, the italic Cyrillic presentation forms are displayed correctly in MS\nWord 2003.\n\nSome problems viewing some polytonic Greek files on the 5.0 CD-ROM under Mac\nOS-X have been reported. These have been fixed on the website and the 6.0 DVD-\nROM, but not on the 5.0 CD-ROM.\n\nWe welcome any comments or questions about the visibility of Unicode on this\nsite in various browsers, and we will add advisories on this page. Extensive\nUnicode resources can be found at [unicode.org](http://www.unicode.org/)\n[External Site].\n\n### Recommended Unicode Fonts\n\nIf you need a Unicode font, we recommend the [Code 2000 shareware\nfont](http://www.code2000.net) [External Site]. This is a very extensive\nWindows font, and the one which we use to test the site with.\n\nWe also recommend the site <http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/fonts.html>, which\nlists dozens of Unicode fonts for a variety of platforms.\n\nA Unicode font, Arial Unicode MS, comes with Windows XP. It has some good\npoints: it seems to have better coverage of some of the more obscure Arabic\ncharacters than Code2000. That said, Arial Unicode MS is not pretty, and if\nreading everything in a sans serif font isn't your cup of tea, you may want to\nlook elsewhere. Note that this font may not be installed on your XP system by\ndefault. If you have XP and don't see Arial Unicode MS as one of your\navailable fonts, you may need to dig out your Windows disk. You also can buy\nit from Microsoft, but they charge an exorbitant $99 for it. With so many free\nand inexpensive Unicode fonts, there is no reason to pay that much!\n\nThere is also a page about [font issues regarding the Unicode Hebrew\nBible](bib/tan/font.htm) at sacred-texts which includes a specialized\nredistributable font.\n\n### Enabling Unicode in Your Browser\n\nThe most common complaint is 'I downloaded and installed Code2000 but I still\nsee little boxes in your files'. This is because **you also have to tell your\nbrowser that you want to view Unicode content using that font**.\n\nFirst of all, we recommend that if you have an older browser, you should\nobtain the most recent version. If you are using AOL or another ISP which has\na bundled browser, you may wish to get the most recent version of Internet\nExplorer or Netscape and use it for browsing Unicode content; the bundled\nbrowsers are notoriously buggy, particularly when it comes to cutting-edge\nfeatures such as Unicode.\n\n**Here's how to get Unicode working in Internet Explorer using Code2000.** The\nprocedure is very similar for other browsers.\n\n###### 1\\. Download and Install the Unicode Font\n\nFirst of all you need to download the font and install it. For instance, if\nyou are using Windows XP, you start the Control Panel 'Fonts' program, and\nthen select 'Install New Font' from the 'File' menu.\n\n###### 2\\. Make the Unicode Font Your Default Web Page Font\n\nLet's assume you have downloaded and installed the 'Code2000' font. Start\nInternet Explorer and go into 'Tools | Internet Options' and select the\n'Fonts' dialog.\n\nOn the 'Web Page Font', Code2000 should show up in the scrolling listbox, if\nyou downloaded it and installed it correctly. Select it.\n\nUnless you do this, some Unicode characters (such as the accented Greek\ncharacters and some Hebrew characters) may not show up.\n\n### I'm still seeing little boxes! What to do?\n\n_The most common problem is skippingstep two in the previous section_. If you\ndon't designate a full Unicode font as your default 'Web Page Font', you will\nstill only have whatever minimal Unicode support is built into your operating\nsystem.\n\nTypically this will include some of the simplest extended Latin accented\ncharacters, as well as basic Greek and Hebrew characters. However, you won't\nbe able to view specialized accented Latin characters, polytonic Greek, or\npointed Hebrew. You won't be able to see any Arabic or Devanagari characters,\nastrological symbols, and so on. _These will show up as the dreaded 'boxes'_\n(or question marks in some browsers).\n\nThe web pages with heavy Unicode dependencies at this site don't have embedded\nfont information because that would greatly inflate their size; and in the\ncase of sections such as the Hebrew Bible and Sanskrit/Transliterated Rig\nVeda, that adds up to some serious extra baggage. Therefore I leave it up to\nyou to tell your browser which font to use. You can always switch it back\neasily if you aren't reading specialized Unicode content.\n\n### Manually Selecting Unicode Encoding\n\nYou may need to also manually select 'Unicode (UTF-8)' in certain browsers.\nFor instance, under Internet Explorer, you can select 'View | Encoding', and\n'Unicode (UTF-8)'. Under Netscape, this is 'View | Character Coding'.\n\nTechnically, some of these pages don't use the UTF-8 encoding scheme. However\nthis seems to be the only way to specify that you are viewing Unicode content\nfor some browsers. I've started to add UTF-8 META tags to all files which have\nany amount of Unicode. This seems to have helped.\n\n### Unicode Implementation\n\nTechnically speaking, the Unicode characters are embedded in 8 bit HTML using\n'character entities', for instance:\n\n> `&#2384;` = \xe0\xa5\x90  \n>  `&#1488;` = \xd7\x90  \n>  `&#937;` = \xce\xa9  \n>\n\nIf your browser is Unicode-enabled, you should see the Sanskrit letter for\n'Aum' ([see this image](hin/hindu.jpg)); the Hebrew letter Aleph, and a Greek\ncapital Omega above.\n\nFor disk space and bandwidth reasons, I've also started to use the UTF-8\nencoding scheme in the files which are predominantly Unicode, such as the\nGreek and Hebrew portions of the Bible and the Rig Veda. This is a variable-\nlength binary compression scheme which encodes Unicode efficiently. Instead of\nthe 6 bytes per character that the HTML entity requires, UTF-8 requires one to\nthree bytes to represent the 16 bit Unicode character set. Most modern\nbrowsers handle UTF-8 automatically, assuming you have installed a complete\nUnicode font.\n\nIn some cases Unicode has been used to transcribe Latin characters with\naccents outside the ISO-8859-1 HTML character set. In other cases complete\ntexts or extensive portions of the text are in Unicode. Among the Unicode\ncharacter sets in use currently are Arabic, Chinese, Extended Latin, Greek,\nHebrew, Tibetan, Runic and Sanskrit.\n\nSome of the Unicode-enabled files at sacred-texts include:\n\n  * [The Hebrew Bible](bib/tan/index.htm) (Tanakh) [Hebrew] \n  * [The Septuagint](bib/sep/index.htm) [Greek] \n  * [The Greek New Testament](bib/gnt/index.htm)\n  * [The Qur'an](isl/uq/index.htm) [Arabic] \n  * [The Rig Veda](hin/rvsan/index.htm) [Sanskrit] \n  * [The Poems of Sappho](cla/usappho/index.htm) [Greek] \n  * [The Confucian Classics](cfu/cfu.htm) in Chinese and English [Chinese] \n  * [The Gnostic John the Baptizer](chr/gno/gjb/index.htm) [Greek, Extended Latin] \n  * [She-rab Dong-bu](bud/srdb/index.htm) [Tibetan] \n  * [The Kebra Nagast](chr/kn/index.htm) [Ethiopian, Extended Latin] \n  * [The Rune Poem](neu/ascp/a12.htm) [Runic] \n  * [Introduction to Astrology](astro/aia/aia17.htm) [Astrological Signs] \n  * [The Tale of the Armament of Igor](neu/tai/index.htm) [Cyrillic, Extended Latin] \n  \n---  \n|  |  [![](cdshop/img/t_istadvd.jpg)  \nNow Shipping!
