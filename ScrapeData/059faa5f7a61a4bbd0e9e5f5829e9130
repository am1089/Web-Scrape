not wood-ward hence;  \nBack to his royal residence!'  \n   Soon as he saw the aged band.  \nExclaiming in their misery, stand,  \nAnd their sad cries around him rang,  \nSwift from his chariot Rama sprang.  \nThen, still upon his journey bent,  \nWith Sita and with Lakshman went  \nThe hero by the old men's side  \nSuiting to theirs his shortened stride.  \nHe could not pass the twice-born throng  \nAs weariedly they walked along:  \nWith pitying heart, with tender eye,  \nHe could not in his chariot fly.  \nWhen the steps of Rama viewed  \nThat still his onward course pursued.  \nWoe shook the troubled heart of each,  \nAnd burnt with grief they spoke this speech--  \n   'With thee, O Rama, to the wood  \nAll Brahmans go and Brahmanhood:  \nBorne on our aged shoulders, see,  \nOur fires of worship go with thee.  \nBright canopies that lend their shade  \nIn Vajapeya 1 rites displayed,  \nIn plenteous store are borne behind  \nLike cloudlets in the autumn wind.  \nNo shelter from the sun hast thou,  \nAnd, lest his fury burn thy brow,  \nThese sacrificial shades we bear  \nShall aid thee in the noontide glare.  \nOur hearts, who ever loved to pore  \nOn sacred text and Vedic lore,  \nNow all to thee, beloved, turn,  \nAnd for a life in forests yearn.  \nDeep in our aged bosoms lies  \nThe Vedas' lore, the wealth we prize,  \nThere still, like wives at home, shall dwell,  \nWhose love and truth protect them well.  \n\np. 148  \n\nTo follow thee our hearts are bent;  \nWe need not plan or argument.  \nAll else in duty's law we slight,  \nFor following thee is following right.  \nO noble Prince, retrace thy way:  \nO, hear us, Rama, as we lay,  \nWith many tears and many prayers,  \nOur aged heads and swan-white hairs  \nLow in the dust before thy feet;  \nO, hear us, Rama, we entreat.  \nFull many of these who with thee run,  \nTheir sacred rites had just begun.  \nUnfinished yet those rites remain;  \nBut finished if thou turn again.  \nAll rooted life and things that move  \nTo thee their deep affection prove.  \nTo them, when warmed by love, they glow  \nAnd sue to thee, some favour show  \nEach lowly bush, each towering tree  \nWould follow too for love of thee.  \nBound by its root it must remain;  \nBut--all it can--its boughs complain,  \nAs when the wild wind rushes by  \nIt tells its woe in groan and sigh.  \nNo more through air the gay birds flit,  \nBut, foodless, melancholy sit  \nTogether on the branch and call  \nTo thee whose kind heart feels for all.'  \n\nAs wailed the aged Brahmans, bent  \nTo turn him back, with wild lament,  \nSeemed Tamasa herself to aid,  \nChecking his progress, as they prayed.  \nSumantra from the chariot freed  \nWith ready hand each weary steed;  \nHe groomed them with the utmost heed,  \n\nTheir limbs he bathed and dried,  \nThen led them forth to drink and feed  \nAt pleasure in the grassy mead  \nThat fringed the river side.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[147:1](ry123.htm#fr_319) An important sacrifice at which seventeen victims\nwere immolated.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XLVI.: The Halt.](ry124.htm)\n\n"
