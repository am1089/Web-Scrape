On account of (the Self) making itself.\n\nOf Brahman which the text had introduced as intent on creation, 'He wished,\nmay I be many' (Taitt. Up. II, 6), a subsequent text says, 'That itself made\nits Self (II, 7), so that Brahman is represented as the object as well as the\nagent in the act of creation. It being the Self only which here is made many,\nwe understand that the Self is material cause as well as operative one. The\nSelf with names and forms non-evolved is agent (cause), the same Self with\nnames and forms evolved is object (effect). There is thus nothing contrary to\nreason in one Self being object as well as agent.\n\nA new doubt here presents itself.--'The True, knowledge, infinite is Brahman'\n(Taitt. Up. II, 1); 'Bliss is Brahman' (B _ri_. Up. III, 9, 28); 'Free from\nsin, free from old age, free from death and grief, free from hunger and\nthirst' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 1,5); 'Without parts, without action, tranquil,\nwithout fault, without taint' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 19); 'This great unborn Self,\nundecaying, undying' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 25)--from all these texts it appears\nthat Brahman is essentially free from even a shadow of all the imperfections\nwhich afflict all sentient and non-sentient beings, and has for its only\ncharacteristics absolutely supreme bliss and knowledge. How then is it\npossible that this Brahman should form the purpose of becoming, and actually\nbecome, manifold, by appearing in the form of a world comprising various\nsentient and non-sentient beings--all of which are the abodes of all kinds of\nimperfections and afflictions? To this question the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 27. Owing to modification](sbe48169.htm)\n\n"
