And on account of (the atoms) having colour and so on, the reverse (takes\nplace); as it is observed.\n\nFrom the view that the atoms of four kinds--viz. of earth or water or fire or\nair--possess colour, taste, smell, and touch, it would follow that the atoms\nare non-eternal, gross, and made up of parts--and this is the reverse of what\nthe Vai _s_ eshikas actually teach as to their atoms, viz. that they are\neternal, subtle, and not made up of parts. For things possessing colour, e.g.\njars, are non-eternal, because it is observed that they are produced from\nother causes of the same, i.e. non-eternal nature, and so on. To a non-\nperceived thing which is assumed in accordance with what is actually\nperceived, we may not ascribe any attributes that would be convenient to us;\nand it is in accordance with actual experience that you Vai _s_ eshikas assume\nthe atoms to possess colour and other qualities. Hence your theory is\nuntenable.--Let it then, in order to avoid this difficulty, be assumed that\nthe atoms do not possess colour and other sensible qualities. To this\nalternative the next Sutra refers.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 15. And as there are objections in both cases](sbe48220.htm)\n\n'
