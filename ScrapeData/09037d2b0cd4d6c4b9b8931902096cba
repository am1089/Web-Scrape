As such injunctions enjoin sacrifices as the means of\nbringing about the object desired to be realised, viz. the heavenly world and\nthe like, there is no other way left than to assume that the result (which is\nseen not to spring directly from the sacrifice) is accomplished by the\nmediation of the apurva.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 40.
