That, therefore, I may not seem biassed by the\nprejudice of education, I am resolved to prove and examine them all; that I\nmay see and hold fast to that which is best ...._\n\n_'Indeed there was never any religion so barbarous and diabolical, but it was\npreferred before all other religions whatsoever, by them that did profess it;\notherwise they would not have professed it ...._\n\n_'And why, say they, may not you be mistaken as well as we? Especially when\nthere is, at least, six to one against your Christian religion; all of which\nthink they serve God aright; and expect happiness thereby as well as you And\nhence it is that in my looking out for the truest religion, being conscious to\nmy self how great an ascendant Christianity holds over me beyond the rest, as\nbeing that religion whereinto I was born and baptized, that which the supreme\nauthority has enjoined and my parents educated me in; that which every one I\nmeet withal highly approves of, and which I my self have, by a long continued\nprofession, made almost natural to me: I am resolved to be more jealous and\nsuspicious of this religion, than of the rest, and be sure not to entertain it\nany longer without being convinced by solid and substantial arguments, of the\ntruth and certainty of it. That, therefore, I may make diligent and impartial\nenquiry into all religions and so be sure to find out the best, I shall for a\ntime, look upon my self as one not at all interested in any particular\nreligion whatsoever, much less in the Christian religion; but only as one who\ndesires, in general, to serve and obey Him that made me, in a right manner,\nand thereby to be made partaker of that happiness my nature is capable of.'_\n\n    BISHOP BEVERIDGE (1636-1707).\n\nPrivate Thoughts on Religion, Part 1, Article 2.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Contents](sbe01001.htm)\n\n"
