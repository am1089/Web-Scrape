Suta said :-- O Mahar _s_ is! (Now hear the main topic). Seeing the\ndark-blue lady looking askance at him, Vyasa Deva thought :-- \xc2\x93Indeed! What is\nto be done now? This Devakanya Apsara Ghritachi is not fit for my household.\xc2\x94\nThen, seeing Vyasa Deva thus thoughtful, the Apsara thought that the Muni\nmight curse her and got terrified. Confounded by terror, she assumed the form\nof a S\xc2\x92uka bird and fled away; Vyasa, too, became greatly surprised to see her\nin the form of a bird. The moment Vyasa saw the extraordinary beautiful form\nof Ghritachi, the Cupid entered then, into his body, and his mind was filled\nwith the thought of sweet feminine form and was gladdened and all his body was\nthrilled with pleasure so that the hairs of the body stood on their ends. The\nMuni Vyasa Deva tried his best and exerted his power of patience to its\nutmost, but failed to control his restless mind to enjoy the woman. Though he\nwas very energetic, and he tried repeatedly to control his heart, enchanted\nwith the beautiful form of Ghritachi, yet he could not, as due to a state of\nthings pre-ordained by God, control his mind. At this state, when he was\nrubbing the fire sticks to get the sacred fire, the two pieces of wood used in\nkindling the fire, his seed (semen) fell upon the Ara _n_ i (the two pieces of\nwood used in kindling the sacred fire). But he did not take any notice of\nthat, and he went on rubbing the firesticks when arose from that Ara _n_ i the\nwonderfully beautiful form of S\xc2\x92uka deva, looking like a second Vyasa. This\nboy, born of Ara _n_ i fuel, looked there brilliant like the blazing fire of\nthe sacrificial place, whereon oblations of ghee are poured. Seeing that\nson,Vyasa Deva was struck with great wonder and thought thus :-- \xc2\x93What is\nthis? How is it that my son is born without any woman.\xc2\x94 Thinking for a while,\nhe came to the conclusion, that this had certainly come to pass as the result\nof boon granted to him by S\'iva. No sooner the fiery S\xc2\x92uka Deva, was born of\nAra _n_ i, he looked brilliant, like fire, by his\n\n\n\np. 48\n\n\n\nown tejas (spirit). At that time Vyasa Deva began to look with one steady gaze\nthe blissful form of his son as a second Garhapatya Fire, brilliant with the\nDivine fire. O hermits! The river Ganges came there from the Himalayas and\nwashed all the inner nerves of the child S\xc2\x92uka Deva, by her holy waters and\nshowers of flowers were poured on his head.\n\n\n\nVyasa Deva next performed all the natal ceremonies of the high-souled child;\nthe celestial drums were sounded and the celestial nymphs began to dance and\nthe lords of the Gandharvas Visvavasu, Narada, Tumburu and others began to\nsing with great joy for the sight of the son. All the Devas and Vidya Dharas\nbegan to chant hymns with gladdened hearts at the sight of the Divine form,\nthe son of Vyasa, born of ara _n_ i. O twice born ones! Then were dropped down\nfrom the sky the divine rod (Da _nd_ a), Kaman _d_ alu, and the antelope skin.\nNo sooner the extraordinarily brilliant S\xc2\x92uka Deva was born than he grew up,\nand Vyasadeva, who is master of endless learning and how to impart them to\nothers, performed the son\'s Upanayana ceremony. No sooner the child was born\nthan all the Vedas with all their secrets and epitomes began to flash in the\nmind of S\xc2\x92uka Deva, as it reigned in Vyasa Deva. O Munis! Bhagavan Vyasa Deva\ngave the name of the child as S\xc2\x92uka as during the moment of his birth he saw\nthe form of Ghritachi in the form of the S\xc2\x92uka bird. S\xc2\x92uka then accepted\nBrihaspati as his guru and began devotedly, with his whole head and heart to\nperform duly the Brahmacharya vow (the life of studentship and celebacy). The\nMuni S\xc2\x92uka remained in the house of his Guru and studied the four Vedas with\ntheir secrets and epitomes and all the other Dharma S\'astras and gave Dak _s_\nina to the Guru duly according to proper rules, and returned home to his\nfather Kri _sn_ a Dvaipayan. Seeing his son S\xc2\x92uka, Vyasadeva got up and\nreceived him with great love and honour and embraced him and took the smell of\nhis head. The holy Vyasa asked about his welfare and about his studies and\nrequested him to stay in that auspicious \xc3\x82s\'rama. Vyasa then thought of\nS\xc2\x92uka\'s marriage and he became anxious and began to enquire where a beautiful\ngirl of a Muni can be found. And he spoke to his son :-- \xc2\x93O highly intelligent\none! You have now studied all the Vedas and Dharma S\'astras. Therefore, O\nsinless one! better marry now. O son! Take a beautiful wife, and leading a\nhouseholder\'s life, worship the Devas and Pitris, and free me from debt. There\nis no other way of issueless persons; he can never go to heaven; so O highly\nfortunate son of mine! Now enter into the life of a householder and make me\nhappy. O highly intelligent one! I have big expectations from you; now try to\nfulfill them. O greatly wise S\xc2\x92uka! After a very severe asceticism, I have got\nyou who are\n\n\n\np. 49\n\n\n\nverily a Deva born without any womb. I am, therefore, your father; save me.\xc2\x94\nWhen Vyasa spoke thus to S\xc2\x92uka, making him sit close by, the highly\ndispassionate Suka at once made out that his father was terribly attached to\nthe world and replied :-- \xc2\x93O knower of Dharma! you have, by the power of your\ngreat intelligence, divided Veda into four parts; why are you therefore\nadvising me so now? I am your disciple; so give me true advice. Certainly I\nwill obey your order.\xc2\x94 At this Vyasa deva said :-- \xc2\x93O son! I have got you\nafter I had performed very severe tapasya, for one hundred years, and\nworshipped Bhagavan S\'ankara in the sole object of having you. O highly wise\none! I will ask some king and will give you sufficient wealth for your family\nexpenses. So that you, having attained this much desired youth, enjoy the\nhouseholder\'s life.\xc2\x94 Hearing these words of the father, S\xc2\x92uka Deva said :-- \xc2\x93O\nfather! Kindly say this to me what pleasure is there in this earth that is not\nmixed with pain. The happiness, that is mixed with pain, is not called\nhappiness by the wise. O highly fortunate one! when I will marry, I will\nbecome certainly submissive to that woman; see then how happiness can be\npossible to one who is dependent; especially to one, dependent on one\'s wife.\nRather freedom can be obtained one day when one is tied to an iron or wooden\npillar; but never freedom will come to that man who is tied by his wife and\nchildren. As the body of man is full of urine and faeces, so is the body of\nthe woman. The more so, when I am born of no womb, how can I find happiness\nthere; not only in this birth, but in my previous birth, too, I had no desire\nto be born of any womb. How can I desire now to enjoy the pleasure of urine\nand faeces in the face of the bliss of self that has got no other bliss equal\nto it? The high-souled persons, that find pleasure in their selves, never go\nafter the sensual pleasures of the objects of enjoyments? When I studied\nfirst, the Veda in detail, it struck me that the Vedas dealt with the S\'astra\nof Karma marga (the way of action); and it is all full of Himsa (injury to\nothers). Then I took Brihaspati as my Guru to shew me the way to true wisdom;\nbut soon I found that he, too, was attacked with the dreadful disease Avidya\n(ignorance) and plunged in the terrible ocean of world, full of Maya. So it\nbecame quite clear to my mind, how could he save me? If the physician be\ndiseased himself, how can he effect cures to other diseases? When I am\ndesirous of liberation, how can I get it from a Guru who is himself deeply\nattached to the world; how can such a one treat my case to free me, from the\ndisease of attachment to this world? It would be merely a farce. I bowed down\nto the Guru and now I am come to you to save me, frightened by this terrible\nserpent of Samsara. Day and night the Jivas travel in this awful wheel of\nSamsara, this constellation of Zodiac; they are moving like the Sun and never\nget any rest. O father! If\n\n\n\np. 50\n\n\n\nwe discuss about the truth of \xc3\x82tman, we will at once find that there is no\ntrace of happiness in this Samsara. As the worms enjoy pleasures in the midst\nof faeces, so the ignorant persons find pleasures in this Samsara. Those who\nhave studied the Vedas and other S\xc2\x92astras and yet are attached to the world,\nare certainly deluded and blind like horses, pigs and dogs; no one is more\nstupid and ignorant than those persons. Getting this extremely rare human\nbirth and studying the Vedanta and other S\xc2\x92astras, if they be attached to this\nworld, then who are the men that will attain freedom? What more wonder can you\nfind in this world than the fact that persons, attached to wives, sons and\nhouses; are denominated as Pundits? That man who is not bound by this Samsara,\ncomposed of the three Gu _n_ as of Maya, is Pundit; that man is intelligent\nand he has understood the real import of the S\xc2\x92astras. What use can there be\nin studying the S\xc2\x92astras, in vain, that teach how to bind men more firmly in\nthis Samsara, full of Maya.\n\n\n\nThat S\xc2\x92astra ought to be studied, which tells how a man would be liberated.\nThe house is called "Griha" because it catches hold of a man firmly. So what\nhappiness can you expect from the house which is like a prison? O father! I am\ntherefore afraid. Those Pundits are certainly stupid and they are certainly\ndeceived by the Creator, who having the birth even of men, become again\nimprisoned.\xc2\x94 Hearing these words of S\xc2\x92uka, Vyasa spoke as follows :-- \xc2\x93O Son!\nThe house is never a prison, nor is it the cause of any bondage; the\nhouseholder whose mind is unattached, can get Mok _s_ a, in spite of his being\nsuch. Truthful, holy, earning wealth by just means and performing, according\nto rules the rites and ceremonies, as stated in the Vedas and doing S\'raddhas\nduly, a householder can certainly get Mok _s_ a. See a man who is a\nBrahmachari, who is an ascetic, who is a Vanaprasthi or follows any other\nmethod or vow, all have got to worship the householder after mid-day. The\nreligious householder, too; welcomes them all, with sweet words, and gives\nthem food, with great love and respect, and thus does them an amount of good.\nFor this reason the householder\'s stage is the most excellent of all; and I\nhave not seen or heard of any other \xc3\x82s\'rama superior to it. For this reason\nVas\'i _st_ ha and other \xc3\x82charyas resorted to householder\'s life, in spite of\ntheir being endowed with great wisdom O highly fortunate one! If one performs\nduly the rites and ceremonies of the Vedas, there is nothing that is\nimpracticable to him. Be it the birth in a good family, or the enjoyment of\nheavens say, or be it Mok _s_ a, whatever desires, it is fructifled to\nsuccess. Also there is no such rule that one will have to remain in one and in\nthe same \xc3\x82s\'rama throughout his life. The Pundits who know Dharma say that\npupils can go from one \xc3\x82srama to another, Therefore, O child! accept Agni (the\n\n\n\np. 51\n\n\n\nhouseholder\'s fire) and try your best to do unremittingly your duties. O Son!\nEnter into a householder\'s life and appease the Devas, Pitris and men;\nprocreate sons and enjoy the pleasures of household life. When old age will\ncome, quit the house and take up the Vanaprasthashram (the third stage) and go\nto a forest and perform the excellent vows and then take up the dharma of the\nSannyasa (renunciation of everything).\n\n\n\nO Fortunate one! He who does not take a wife, is certainly maddened by these\nindomitable five organs of action, five organs of senses and mind. Therefore,\nthe makers of the S\xc2\x92astras say, that to save one self from the pernicious\ninfluences of these vicious senses, one is to take wife during his youth time\nand then be engaged in performing tapasya during his old age. O fortunate one!\nIn days of yore, the fiery Rajar _s_ i Vis\'vamitra practised very severe\ntapasya without any food for three thousand years, and thought he was very\nstrong and shining like fire, he was fascinated by the charm of the celestial\nnymph Menaka. And an auspicious daughter was born from the womb of Menaka by\nVis\'vamitra. My father Paras\'ara, though a great ascetic, was struck with\nCupid\'s arrows at the sight of the daughter of a fisherman, named Kali and\naccepted her in the boat. What more than this, that Brahma seeing his own\ndaughter Sandhya was struck by passion and ran after her, when Bhagavan Rudra\nDeva made him unconscious by his Humkar sound and made Brahma desist from the\nattempt.\n\n\n\nSo, O fortunate one! Take my word pregnant of good issues and marry a lady,\nborn of a good family, and follow the path presented in the Vedas.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nThus ends the fourteenth Chapter of the 1st Skandha, on the birth of S\xc2\x92uka\nDeva and the duties of householders in the Maha Pura _n_ a S\'rimad Devi\nBhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Vedavyas.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 15](bk01ch15.htm)\n\n'
