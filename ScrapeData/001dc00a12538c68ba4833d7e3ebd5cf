The 'light' (is Brahman), on account of the mention of feet (in a passage\nwhich is connected with the passage about the light).\n\nScripture says ( _Kh_. Up. III, 13, 7), 'Now that light which shines above\nthis heaven, higher than all, higher than everything,\n\np. 88\n\nin the highest worlds beyond which there are no other worlds that is the same\nlight which is within man.' Here the doubt presents itself whether the word\n'light' denotes the light of the sun and the like, or the highest Self. Under\nthe preceding Sutras we had shown that some words which ordinarily have\ndifferent meanings yet in certain passages denote Brahman, since\ncharacteristic marks of the latter are mentioned. Here the question has to be\ndiscussed whether, in connexion with the passage quoted, characteristic marks\nof Brahman are mentioned or not.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that the word 'light' denotes nothing else but the\nlight of the sun and the like, since that is the ordinary well-established\nmeaning of the term. The common use of language, he says, teaches us that the\ntwo words 'light' and 'darkness' denote mutually opposite things, darkness\nbeing the term for whatever interferes with the function of the sense of\nsight, as, for instance, the gloom of the night, while sunshine and whatever\nelse favours the action of the eye is called light. The word 'shines' also,\nwhich the text exhibits, is known ordinarily to refer to the sun and similar\nsources of light; while of Brahman, which is devoid of colour, it cannot be\nsaid, in the primary sense of the word, that it 'shines.' Further, the word\n_g_ yotis must here denote light because it is said to be bounded by the sky\n('that light which shines above this heaven'). For while it is impossible to\nconsider the sky as being the boundary of Brahman, which is the Self of all\nand the source of all things movable or immovable, the sky may be looked upon\nas forming the boundary of light, which is a mere product and as such limited;\naccordingly the text says, 'the light beyond heaven.'--But light, although a\nmere product, is perceived everywhere; it would therefore be wrong to declare\nthat it is bounded by the sky!--Well, then, the purvapakshin replies, let us\nassume that the light meant is the first-born (original) light which has not\nyet become tripartite 1. This explanation again cannot be\n\np. 89\n\nadmitted, because the non-tripartite light does not serve any purpose.--But,\nthe purvapakshin resumes, Why should its purpose not be found therein that it\nis the object of devout meditation?--That cannot be, we reply; for we see that\nonly such things are represented as objects of devotion as have some other\nindependent use of their own; so, for instance, the sun (which dispels\ndarkness and so on). Moreover the scriptural passage, 'Let me make each of\nthese three (fire, water, and earth) tripartite,' does not indicate any\ndifference 1. And even of the non-tripartite light it is not known that the\nsky constitutes its boundary.--Well, then (the purvapakshin resumes, dropping\nthe idea of the non-tripartite light), let us assume that the light of which\nthe text speaks is the tripartite (ordinary) light. The objection that light\nis seen to exist also beneath the sky, viz. in the form of fire and the like,\nwe invalidate by the remark that there is nothing contrary to reason in\nassigning a special locality to fire, although the latter is observed\neverywhere; while to assume a special place for Brahman, to which the idea of\nplace does not apply at all, would be most unsuitable. Moreover, the clause\n'higher than everything, in the highest worlds beyond which there are no other\nworlds,' which indicates a multiplicity of abodes, agrees much better with\nlight, which is a mere product (than with Brahman). There is moreover that\nother clause, also, 'That is the same light which is within man,' in which the\nhighest light is identified with the gastric fire (the fire within man). Now\nsuch identifications can be made only where there is a certain similarity of\nnature; as is seen, for instance, in the passage, 'Of that person Bhu _h_ is\nthe head, for the head is one and that syllable is one' (B _ri_. Up. V, 5, 3).\nBut that the fire within the human body is not Brahman clearly appears from\nthe passage, 'Of this we have visible and audible proof' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 13,\n7; 8), which declares that\n\np. 90\n\nthe fire is characterised by the noise it makes, and by heat; and likewise\nfrom the following passage, 'Let a man meditate on this as that which is seen\nand heard.' The same conclusion may be drawn from the passage, 'He who knows\nthis becomes conspicuous and celebrated,' which proclaims an inconsiderable\nreward only, while to the devout meditation on Brahman a high reward would\nhave to be allotted. Nor is there mentioned in the entire passage about the\nlight any other characteristic mark of Brahman, while such marks are set forth\nin the passages (discussed above) which refer to pra _n_ a and the ether. Nor,\nagain, is Brahman indicated in the preceding section, 'the Gayatri is\neverything whatsoever exists,' &c. (III, 12); for that passage makes a\nstatement about the Gayatri metre only. And even if that section did refer to\nBrahman, still Brahman would not be recognised in the passage at present under\ndiscussion; for there (in the section referred to) it is declared--in the\nclause, 'Three feet of it are the Immortal in heaven'--that heaven constitutes\nthe abode; while in our passage the words 'the light above heaven' declare\nheaven to be a boundary. For all these reasons the word _g_ yotis is here to\nbe taken in its ordinary meaning, viz. light.\n\nTo this we make the following reply. The word _g_ yotis must be held to denote\nBrahman. Why? On account of the feet (quarters) being mentioned. In a\npreceding passage Brahman had been spoken of as having four feet (quarters).\n'Such is the greatness of it; greater than it is the Person (purusha). One\nfoot of it are all the beings, three feet of it are the Immortal in heaven.'\nThat which in this passage is said to constitute the three-quarter part,\nimmortal and connected with heaven, of Brahman, which altogether comprises\nfour quarters; this very same entity we recognise as again referred to in the\npassage under discussion, because there also it is said to be connected with\nheaven. If therefore we should set it aside in our interpretation of the\npassage and assume the latter to refer to the ordinary light, we should commit\nthe mistake of dropping, without need, the topic started and introducing\n\np. 91\n\na new subject. Brahman, in fact, continues to form the subject-matter, not\nonly of the passage about the light, but likewise of the subsequent section,\nthe so-called Sa _nd_ ilya-vidya ( _Kh_. Up. III, 14). Hence we conclude that\nin our passage the word 'light' must be held to denote Brahman. The objection\n(raised above) that from common use the words 'light' and 'to shine' are known\nto denote effected (physical) light is without force; for as it is known from\nthe general topic of the chapter that Brahman is meant, those two words do not\nnecessarily denote physical light only to the exclusion of Brahman 1, but may\nalso denote Brahman itself, in so far as it is characterised by the physical\nshining light which is its effect. Analogously another mantra declares, 'that\nby which the sun shines kindled with heat' (Taitt. Br. III, 12, 9, 7). Or else\nwe may suppose that the word _g_ yotis here does not denote at all that light\non which the function of the eye depends. For we see that in other passages it\nhas altogether different meanings; so, for instance, B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 5,\n'With speech only as light man sits,' and Taitt. Sa. I, 6, 3, 3, 'May the\nmind, the light, accept,' &c. It thus appears that whatever illuminates (in\nthe different senses of the word) something else may be spoken of as 'light.'\nHence to Brahman also, whose nature is intelligence, the term 'light' may be\napplied; for it gives light to the entire world. Similarly, other scriptural\npassages say, 'Him the shining one, everything shines after; by his light all\nthis is lighted' (Kau. Up. II, 5, 15); and 'Him the gods worship as the light\nof lights, as the immortal' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 16). Against the further\nobjection that the omnipresent Brahman cannot be viewed as bounded by heaven\nwe remark that the assignment, to Brahman, of a special locality is not\ncontrary to reason because it subserves the purpose of devout meditation. Nor\ndoes it avail anything to say that it is impossible to assign any place to\nBrahman because Brahman is out of connexion with all place. For it is possible\nto make such\n\np. 92\n\nan assumption, because Brahman is connected with certain limiting adjuncts.\nAccordingly Scripture speaks of different kinds of devout meditation on\nBrahman as specially connected with certain localities, such as the sun, the\neye, the heart. For the same reason it is also possible to attribute to\nBrahman a multiplicity of abodes, as is done in the clause (quoted above)\n'higher than all.' The further objection that the light beyond heaven is the\nmere physical light because it is identified with the gastric fire, which\nitself is a mere effect and is inferred from perceptible marks such as the\nheat of the body and a certain sound, is equally devoid of force; for the\ngastric fire may be viewed as the outward appearance (or symbol) of Brahman,\njust as Brahman's name is a mere outward symbol. Similarly in the passage,\n'Let a man meditate on it (the gastric light) as seen and heard,' the\nvisibility and audibility (here implicitly ascribed to Brahman) must be\nconsidered as rendered possible through the gastric fire being the outward\nappearance of Brahman. Nor is there any force in the objection that Brahman\ncannot be meant because the text mentions an inconsiderable reward only; for\nthere is no reason compelling us to have recourse to Brahman for the purpose\nof such and such a reward only, and not for the purpose of such and such\nanother reward. Wherever the text represents the highest Brahman--which is\nfree from all connexion with distinguishing attributes--as the universal Self,\nit is understood that the result of that instruction is one only, viz. final\nrelease. Wherever, on the other hand, Brahman is taught to be connected with\ndistinguishing attributes or outward symbols, there, we see, all the various\nrewards which this world can offer are spoken of; cp. for instance, B _ri_.\nUp. IV, 4, 24, 'This is he who eats all food, the giver of wealth. He who\nknows this obtains wealth.' Although in the passage itself which treats of the\nlight no characteristic mark of Brahman is mentioned, yet, as the Sutra\nintimates, the mark stated in a preceding passage (viz. the mantra, 'Such is\nthe greatness of it,' &c.) has to be taken in connexion with the passage about\nthe light as well. The question how the mere circumstance of Brahman being\n\np. 93\n\nmentioned in a not distant passage can have the power of divorcing from its\nnatural object and transferring to another object the direct statement about\nlight implied in the word 'light,' may be answered without difficulty. The\npassage under discussion runs 1, 'which above this heaven, the light.' The\nrelative pronoun with which this clause begins intimates, according to its\ngrammatical force 2, the same Brahman which was mentioned in the previous\npassage, and which is here recognised (as being the same which was mentioned\nbefore) through its connexion with heaven; hence the word _g_ yotis also--\nwhich stands in grammatical co-ordination to 'which'--must have Brahman for\nits object. From all this it follows that the word 'light' here denotes\nBrahman.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[88:1](sbe34030.htm#fr_126) I. e. which has not been mixed with water and\nearth, according to _Kh_.
