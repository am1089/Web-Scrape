Hereby the Yoga is refuted.\n\nBy the above refutation of Kapila's Sm _ri_ ti the Yoga-sm _ri_ ti also is\nrefuted.--But a question arises, What further doubt arises here with regard to\nthe Yoga system, so as to render needful the formal extension to the Yoga of\nthe arguments previously set forth against the Sa _n_ khya?--It might appear,\nwe reply, that the Vedanta should be supported by the Yoga-sm _ri_ ti,\nfirstly, because the latter admits\n\np. 413\n\nthe existence of a Lord; secondly, because the Vedanta-texts mention Yoga as a\nmeans to bring about final Release; and thirdly, because Hira _n_ yagarbha,\nwho proclaimed the Yoga-sm _ri_ ti is qualified for the promulgation of all\nVedanta-texts.--But these arguments refute themselves as follows. In the first\nplace the Yoga holds the Pradhana, which is independent of Brahman, to be the\ngeneral material cause, and hence the Lord acknowledged by it is a mere\noperative cause. In the second place the nature of meditation, in which Yoga\nconsists, is determined by the nature of the object of meditation, and as of\nits two objects, viz. the soul and the Lord, the former does not have its Self\nin Brahman, and the latter is neither the cause of the world nor endowed with\nthe other auspicious qualities (which belong to Brahman), the Yoga is not of\nVedic character. And as to the third point, Hira _n_ yagarbha himself is only\nan individual soul, and hence liable to be overpowered by the inferior gu _n_\nas, i.e. passion and darkness; and hence the Yoga-sm _ri_ ti is founded on\nerror, no less than the Pura _n_ as, promulgated by him, which are founded on\nra _g_ as and tamas. The Yoga cannot, therefore, be used for the support of\nthe Vedanta.--Here finishes the adhikara _n_ a of 'the refutation of the\nYoga.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 4.
