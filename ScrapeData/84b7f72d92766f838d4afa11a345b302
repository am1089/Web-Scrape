The asvattha-tree as a destroyer of enemies.\n\n1\\. A male has sprung from a male, the asvattha (ficus religiosa) from the\nkhadira (acacia catechu). May this slay my enemies, those whom I hate and\nthose who hate me!  \n2\\. Crush the enemies, as they rush on, O asvattha, 'displacer,' allied with\nIndra, the slayer of Vritra, (allied) with Mitra and Varuxa!  \n3\\. As thou didst break forth, O asvattha, into the great flood (of the air),\nthus do thou break up all those whom I hate and those who hate me!  \n4\\. Thou that goest conquering as a conquering bull, with thee here, O\nasvattha, may we conquer our rivals!  \n5\\. May Nirriti (the goddess of destruction), O asvattha, bind in the toils of\ndeath that cannot be loosened those enemies of mine whom I hate and who hate\nme!  \n6\\. As thou climbest up the trees, O asvattha, and renderest them subordinate,\nthus do thou split in two the head of iny enemy, and overcome him!  \n7\\. They (the enemies) shall float down like a ship cut loose from its\nmoorings! There is no returning again for those that have been driven out by\nthe 'displacer.'  \n8\\. I drive them out with my mind, drive them out with my thought, and also\nwith my incantation. We drive them out with a branch of the asvattha-tree.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 75.
