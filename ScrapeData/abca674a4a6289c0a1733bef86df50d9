Yea! for its leaves  \nAre green and waving hymns which whisper Truth!  \nWho knows the Aswattha, knows Veds, and all.\n\nIts branches shoot to heaven and sink to earth,  \nEven as the deeds of men, which take their birth  \nFrom qualities: its silver sprays and blooms,  \nAnd all the eager verdure of its girth,  \nLeap to quick life at kiss of sun and air,  \nAs men\'s lives quicken to the temptings fair  \nOf wooing sense: its hanging rootlets seek  \nThe soil beneath, helping to hold it there,\n\nAs actions wrought amid this world of men  \nBind them by ever-tightening bonds again.  \nIf ye knew well the teaching of the Tree,  \nWhat its shape saith; and whence it springs; and, then\n\nHow it must end, and all the ills of it,  \nThe axe of sharp Detachment ye would whet,  \nAnd cleave the clinging snaky roots, and lay  \nThis Aswattha of sense-life low,- to set\n\nNew growths upspringing to that happier sky,-  \nWhich they who reach shall have no day to die,  \nNor fade away, nor fall- to Him, I mean,  \nFATHER and FIRST, Who made the mystery\n\nOf old Creation; for to Him come they  \nFrom passion and from dreams who break away;  \nWho part the bonds constraining them to flesh,  \nAnd,- Him, the Highest, worshipping alway-\n\nNo longer grow at mercy of what breeze  \nOf summer pleasure stirs the sleeping trees,  \nWhat blast of tempest tears them, bough and stem:  \nTo the eternal world pass such as these!\n\nAnother Sun gleams there! another Moon!  \nAnother Light,- not Dusk, nor Dawn, nor Noon-  \nWhich they who once behold return no more;  \nThey have attained My rest, life\'s Utmost boon!\n\nWhen, in this world of manifested life,  \nThe undying Spirit, setting forth from Me,  \nTaketh on form, it draweth to itself  \nFrom Being\'s storehouse,- which containeth all,-  \nSenses and intellect. The Sovereign Soul  \nThus entering the flesh, or quitting it,  \nGathers these up, as the wind gathers scents,  \nBlowing above the flower.-beds. Ear and Eye,  \nAnd Touch and Taste, and Smelling, these it takes,-  \nYea, and a sentient mind;- linking itself  \nTo sense-things so.  \nThe unenlightened ones  \nMark not that Spirit when he goes or comes,  \nNor when he takes his pleasure in the form,  \nConjoined with qualities; but those see plain  \nWho have the eyes to see. Holy souls see  \nWhich strive thereto. Enlightened, they perceive  \nThat Spirit in themselves; but foolish ones,  \nEven though they strive, discern not, having hearts  \nUnkindled, ill-informed!  \nKnow, too, from Me  \nShineth the gathered glory of the suns  \nWhich lighten all the world: from Me the moons  \nDraw silvery beams, and fire fierce loveliness.  \nI penetrate the clay, and lend all shapes  \nTheir living force; I glide into the plant-  \nRoot, leaf, and bloom- to make the woodlands green  \nWith springing sap. Becoming vital warmth,  \nI glow in glad, respiring frames, and pass,  \nWith outward and with inward breath, to feed  \nThe body by all meats.  \nFor in this world  \nBeing is twofold: the Divided, one;  \nThe Undivided, one. All things that live  \nAre "the Divided." That which sits apart,  \n"The Undivided."  \nHigher still is He,  \nThe Highest, holding all, whose Name is LORD,  \nThe Eternal, Sovereign, First! Who fills all worlds,  \nSustaining them. And- dwelling thus beyond  \nDivided Being and Undivided- I  \nAm called of men and Vedas, Life Supreme,  \nThe PURUSHOTTAMA.  \nWho knows Me thus,  \nWith mind unclouded, knoweth all, dear Prince!  \nAnd with his whole soul ever worshippeth Me.\n\nNow is the sacred, secret Mystery  \nDeclared to thee! Who comprehendeth this  \nHath wisdom! He is quit of works in bliss!\n\nHERE ENDETH CHAPTER XV OF THE  \nBHAGAVAD-GITA,  \nEntitled "Purushottamapraptiyog,"  \nOr "The Book of Religion by Attaining the Supreme."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 16: Of the Separateness of the Divine and the\nUndivine](bg16.htm)\n\n'
