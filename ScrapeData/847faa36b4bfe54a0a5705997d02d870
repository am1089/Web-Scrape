Not from non-entity, this not being observed.\n\nSo far we have set forth the arguments refuting the views of the Vaibhashikas\nas well as the Sautrantikas--both which schools maintain the reality of\nexternal things.--Now the Sautrantika comes forward and opposes one of the\narguments set forth by us above, viz. that, on the view of general\nmomentariness. nothing can ever become an object of cognition, since the thing\nwhich enters into connexion with the sense-organ is no longer in existence\nwhen the cognition originates.--It is not, he says, the persistence of the\nthing up to the time of cognition which is the cause of its becoming an object\nof cognition. To be an object of cognition means nothing more than to be the\ncause of the origination of cognition. Nor does this definition imply that the\nsense-organs also are the objects of cognition. For a cause of cognition is\nheld to be an object of cognition only in so far as it imparts to the\ncognition its own form (and this the sense-organs do not). Now even a thing\nthat has perished may have imparted its form to the cognition, and on the\nbasis of that form, blue colour, and so on, the thing itself is inferred. Nor\ncan it be said (as the Yoga _k_ aras do) that the form of subsequent\ncognitions is due to the action of previous cognitions (and not to the\nexternal thing); for on this hypothesis it could not be explained how in the\nmidst of a series of cognitions of blue colour there all at once arises the\ncognition of yellow colour. The manifold character of cognitions must\ntherefore be held to be due to the manifold character of real thing.--To this\nwe reply 'not from non-entity; this not being observed.' The special forms of\ncognition, such as blue colour, and so on, cannot be the forms of things that\nhave perished, and therefore are not in Being, since this is not observed. For\nit is not observed that when a substrate of attributes has perished, its\nattributes pass over into another thing. (Nor can it be said that the thing\nthat perished leaves in cognition a reflection of itself, for) reflections\nalso are only of\n\np. 511\n\npersisting things, not of mere attributes. We therefore conclude that the\nmanifoldness of cognitions can result from the manifoldness of things only on\nthe condition of the thing persisting at the time of cognition.--The Sutras\nnow set forth a further objection which applies to both schools.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 26.
