When he stands forth as the most glorious one\namong them [2](sbe46033.htm#an_1:97:3:2), and when our liberal lords excel--\ndriving away evil with thy light--\n\n4\\. When through thee, Agni, the liberal lords, and when through thee we may\nmultiply with offspring--driving away evil with thy light--\n\n5\\. When the rays of the mighty Agni go forth on all sides--driving away evil\nwith thy light--\n\n6\\. For thou indeed, (O god) whose face is turned everywhere, encompassest\n(the world) everywhere--driving away evil with thy light.\n\n7\\.

Metre, Gayatri. The hymn is addressed to Agni _S_ u _k_ i.\n--Verses 1-8 = AV. IV, 33, 1-8: T\xc3\x82. VI, 11, 1-2\\. Verse 1 = T\xc3\x82. VI, 10, 1.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Lanman (Sanskrit Reader, p. 363) translates: 'Driving away with flames\nour sin.' But agha is not exactly sin.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. In this verse as well as in the verses 4 and 5--all commencing with\nthe words pra yat--the principal clauses are wanting. As to 3 meaning,\nhowever, these clauses are supplied by the refrain; 'driving away evil' of\ncourse means 'may he drive away evil.'\n\nNote 2. 'Among them' seems to mean among the liberal lords.'\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. Cf. Lanman, p. 434.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 98](sbe46034.htm)\n\n"
