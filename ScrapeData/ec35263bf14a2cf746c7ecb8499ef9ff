There are five great sacrifices, and they, indeed, are great\nsacrificial sessions,--to wit, the sacrifice to beings, the sacrifice to men,\nthe sacrifice to the Fathers, the sacrifice to the gods, and the sacrifice to\nthe Brahman.\n\n11:5:6:22\\. Day by day one should offer an oblation to beings: thus he\nperforms that sacrifice to beings. Day by day one should offer (presents to\nguests) up to the cupful of water 3: thus he performs that\n\np. 96\n\nsacrifice to men. Day by day one should offer with Svadha up to the cupful of\nwater 1: thus he performs that sacrifice to the Fathers. Day by day one should\nperform with Svaha up to the log of firewood 2: thus he performs that\nsacrifice to the gods.\n\n11:5:6:33\\. Then as to the sacrifice to the Brahman. The sacrifice to the\nBrahman is one's own (daily) study (of the Veda). The _g_ uhu-spoon of this\nsame sacrifice to the Brahman is speech, its upabh _ri_ t the mind, its dhruva\nthe eye, its sruva mental power, its purificatory bath truth, its conclusion\nheaven. And, verily, however great the world he gains by giving away (to the\npriests) this earth replete with wealth, thrice that and more--an imperishable\nworld does he gain, whosoever, knowing this, studies day by day his lesson (of\nthe Veda): therefore let him study his daily lesson.\n\n11:5:6:44\\. Verily, the _Ri_ k-texts are milk-offerings to the gods; and\nwhosoever, knowing this, studies day by day the _Ri_ k-texts for his lesson,\nthereby satisfies the gods with milk-offerings; and, being satisfied, they\nsatisfy him by (granting him) security of\n\np. 97\n\npossession 1, by life-breath, by seed, by his whole self, and by all\nauspicious blessings; and rivers of ghee and rivers of honey flow for his\n(departed) Fathers, as their accustomed draughts.\n\n11:5:6:55\\. And, verily, the Ya _g_ us-texts are ghee-offerings to the gods;\nand whosoever, knowing this, studies day by day the Ya _g_ us-texts for his\nlesson thereby satisfies the gods with ghee-offerings; and, being satisfied,\nthey satisfy him by security of possession, by life-breath, by seed, by his\nwhole self, and by all auspicious blessings; and rivers of ghee and rivers of\nhoney flow for his Fathers, as their accustomed draughts.\n\n11:5:6:66\\. And, verily, the Saman-texts are Soma-offerings to the gods; and\nwhosoever, knowing this, studies day by day the Saman-texts for his lesson\nthereby satisfies the gods with Soma-offerings; and, being satisfied, they\nsatisfy him by security of possession, by life-breath, by seed, by his whole\nself, and by all auspicious blessings; and rivers of ghee and rivers of honey\nflow for his Fathers, as their accustomed draughts.\n\n11:5:6:77\\. And, verily, the (texts of the) Atharva\xe1\xb9\x85giras are fat-offerings to\nthe gods; and whosoever, knowing this, studies day by day the (texts of the)\nAtharva\xe1\xb9\x85giras for his lesson, satisfies the gods with fat-offerings; and,\nbeing satisfied, they satisfy him by security of possession, by life-breath,\nby seed, by his whole self, and by all auspicious blessings; and rivers of\nghee and rivers of honey flow for his Fathers, as their accustomed draughts.\n\np. 98\n\n11:5:6:88\\. And, verily, the precepts 1, the sciences 2, the dialogue 3, the\ntraditional myths and legends 4, and the Nara _s_ a _m_ si Gathas 5 are honey-\nofferings to the gods; and whosoever, knowing this, studies day by day the\nprecepts, the sciences, the dialogue, the traditional myths and legends, and\nthe Nara _s_ a _m_ si Gathas, for his lesson, satisfies the gods with honey-\nofferings; and, being satisfied, they satisfy him by (granting him) security\nof possession, by life-breath, by seed, by his whole self, and by all\nauspicious blessings; and rivers of ghee and rivers of honey flow for his\nFathers, as their accustomed draughts.\n\np. 99\n\n11:5:6:99\\. Now, for this, sacrifice to the Brahman there are four Vasha _t_\n-calls 1,--to wit, when the wind blows, when it lightens, when it thunders,\nand when it rumbles 2 whence he who knows this should certainly study 3 when\nthe wind is blowing, and when it lightens, or thunders, or rumbles, so as not\nto lose his Vasha _t_ -calls; and verily he is freed from recurring death, and\nattains to community of nature (or, being) with the Brahman. And should he be\naltogether unable (to study), let him at least read a single divine word; and\nthus he is not shut out from beings 4.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[95:3](sbe44030.htm#fr_310) Or perhaps, from a cupful of water onwards,--\naharahar dadyad p. 96 iti manushyan uddi _s_ ya odapatrat udakapuritam patram\nudapatram udakapatravadhi yad odanadika _m_ dadyat sa manushyaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a ity\nartha _h_ , Say.--Cf. J. Muir, Orig. Sanskrit Texts, vol. iii, p. 18 seqq.\n\n[96:1](sbe44030.htm#fr_311) In making offering to the (three immediately\npreceding) departed ancestors, water is poured our for them (to wash\nthemselves with) both at the beginning and at the end of the ceremony; see II,\n4, 2, 16; 23; II, 6, 1, 34; 41, where each time it is said that this is done\n'even as one would pour out water for (a guest) who is to take (or has taken)\nfood with him;'--pit _r i_n uddi _s_ ya pratyaha _m_ svadhakare _n_ a\nannadikam udapatraparyanta _m_ dadyat, Say.\n\n[96:2](sbe44030.htm#fr_312) Apparently the log of wood placed on the\nGarhapatya after the completion of the offering.\n\n[97:1](sbe44030.htm#fr_313) Apraptasya phalasya praptir yoga _h_ tasya\nparipalana _m_ kshema _h_ , Say.\n\n[98:1](sbe44030.htm#fr_314) The Anu _s_ asanani, according to Saya _n_ a, are\nthe six Veda\xe1\xb9\x85gas, or rules of grammar, etymology, &c.\n\n[98:2](sbe44030.htm#fr_315) By vidya _h_ , according to Saya _n_ a, the\nphilosophical systems, Nyaya, Mima _m_ sa, &c., are to be understood. More\nlikely, however, such special sciences as the 'sarpavidya' (science of snakes)\nare referred to; cf. [XIII, 4, 3, 9](sbe44104.htm#13:4:3:9) seqq.\n\n[98:3](sbe44030.htm#fr_316) Vakovakyam, apparently some special theological\ndiscourse, or discourses, similar to (if not identical with) the numerous\nBrahmodya, or disputations on spiritual matters. As an example of such a\ndialogue, Saya _n_ a refers to the dialogue between Uddalaka \xc3\x82ru _n_ i and\nSvaidaya _n_ a Gautama, [XI, 4, 1, 4](sbe44021.htm#11:4:1:4) seqq.\n\n[98:4](sbe44030.htm#fr_317) Itihasa-pura _n_ a: the Itihasa, according to Saya\n_n_ a, are cosmological myths or accounts, such as 'In the beginning this\nuniverse was nothing but water,' &c.; whilst as an instance of the Pura _n_ a\n(stories of olden times, puratanapurushav _ri_ ttanta) he refers to the story\nof Pururavas and Urva _s_ i. Cf. Max Muller, History of Ancient Sanskrit\nLiterature, p. 40.\n\n[98:5](sbe44030.htm#fr_318) Or, the Gathas and Nara _s_ a _m_ sis. Saya _n_ a,\nin the first place, takes the two as one, meaning 'stanzas (or verses) telling\nabout men;' but he then refers to the interpretation by others, according to\nwhich the Gathas are such verses as that about 'the great snake driven from\nthe lake' ([XI, 5, 5, 8](sbe44029.htm#11:5:5:8)); whilst the Nara _s_ a _m_\nsis would be (verses 'telling about men') such as that regarding _G_ aname _g_\naya and his horses ([XI, 5, 5, 12](sbe44029.htm#11:5:5:12)). On Aitareyar. II,\n3, 6, 8, Saya _n_ a quotes 'prata _h_ pratar an _ri_ ta _m_ to vadanti' as an\ninstance of a Gatha.\n\n[99:1](sbe44030.htm#fr_319) That is, the call 'Vausha _t_!' with which, at the\nend of the offering-formula, the oblation is poured into the fire.\n\n[99:2](sbe44030.htm#fr_320) That is, when the rumbling of distant thunder is\nheard; or, perhaps, when there is a rattling sound, as from hail-stones.\n\n[99:3](sbe44030.htm#fr_321) Hardly, should only study,--adhiyitaiva.\n\n[99:4](sbe44030.htm#fr_322) Or, from (the world of) spirits (?).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 5, 7.
