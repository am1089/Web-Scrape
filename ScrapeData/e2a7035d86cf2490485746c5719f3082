This Scripture and Sm _ri_ ti alike\nteach. 'That Self cannot be gained by the Veda, nor by understanding, nor by\nmuch learning. He whom the Self chooses by him the Self can be gained. The\nSelf chooses him as his own' (Ka. Up. I, 2, 23); 'When a man's nature has\nbecome purified by the serene light of knowledge, then he sees him, meditating\non him as without parts' (Mu. Up.

Sm _ri_ ti: 'Neither by the\nVedas, nor austerities, nor gifts, nor by sacrifice, but only by exclusive\ndevotion, may I in this form be known and beheld in truth and also entered\ninto' (Bha. Gi. XI, 53,54).
