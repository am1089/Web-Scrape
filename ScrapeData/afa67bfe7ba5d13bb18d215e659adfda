Pledges.\n\n* 124. 124 That to which a title is given (adhikriyate) is called a pledge. There are two kinds of it: a\n\np. 73\n\npledge which must be redeemed within a certain time, and a pledge which must\nbe retained till the debt has been discharged.\n\n* 125. 125 A pledge is again twofold: one to be kept only, and a pledge for enjoyment. It must be preserved precisely in the same condition (as at the time of its delivery); otherwise the pledgee loses interest.\n\n* 126. 126 The same thing happens when the pledge has been injured owing to the negligence of the pledgee. If it has been lost, the principal is forfeited, provided that the loss was not caused by fate or the king.\n\n* 127. 127 A pledge (for custody) must not be used\n\np. 74\n\nforcibly. The pledgee who uses it forfeits the interest due to him. Moreover\nhe must make good the value (of the pledge) to the owner. Otherwise he is\n(considered as) a thief of the pledge.\n\n128. 128 That foolish person who uses a pledge without authorization from the owner, shall lose one half of his interest, as a compensation for such use.\n\n129. 129 If a pledge for enjoyment has been given, (the creditor) must not take interest on the loan. Neither must he give or sell a pledge (of any sort) before the (stipulated) period has elapsed.\n\n* 130. 130 When a pledge, though carefully kept, loses its value after a certain time, (the debtor) must either give another pledge, or discharge the debt to the debtor.\n\n* 131. 131 When a debtor has been disabled by a reverse of fortune (from paying the debt), he shall be made to discharge the debt gradually, according to his means, as he happens to gain property.\n\n* 132. 132 If a wealthy debtor from malice refuses to\n\np. 75\n\npay his debt, the king shall compel him to pay it by forcible means, and shall\ntake five in the hundred for himself.\n\n133. 133 If the debtor acknowledges the debt with his own mouth, the king shall take from him ten per cent. (of the debt) as a fine; and twice as much (i.e. twenty per cent.) if he has been convicted (after denial of the debt).\n\n134. 134 If the debtor, owing to a calamity, has not means sufficient to discharge the whole debt, (the claim of the creditor) shall be entered in a legal document, specifying the caste (of the creditor and debtor), their names, and the names of their neighbours.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[72:124](sbe3316.htm#fr_219) According to Asahaya, the pledge to be released\nwithin a specified time is again twofold. It may be either deposited with a\n'keeper of the pledge' (adhipala), who is to return it on the pledge p. 73\nbeing restored at the time agreed on. Or it may be delivered to the creditor\non condition of its being returned after the lapse of a certain period, say\nfive or ten years. The usufruct of a 'pledge to be retained till the debt has\nbeen liquidated' shall belong to the creditor for ever, till the debt has been\ndischarged.\n\n[73:125](sbe3316.htm#fr_220) Asahaya gives a house and a field as instances of\na pledge for use. By spoiling a pledge of this kind, the pledgee forfeits\ninterest, i.e. he loses the produce of a field, the use of a dwelling-place,\n&c.\n\n[73:126](sbe3316.htm#fr_221) 'Negligence,' with regard to a bull or other\npledge for use, means that it is used at an unseasonable time, or too much,\nfor drawing a cart or carrying a burden. With regard to a pledge for custody,\nit means that it is abandoned. 'When it has been injured,' as e.g. when an\nanimal given as a pledge has lost one eye. 'The king' may cause the loss of\nthe pledge, if he confiscates the whole property of a man and the pledge\ntogether with it, on account of a slight offence. The loss is caused 'by\nfate,' if e.g. a pledge is stolen by a thief. A. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 59;\nVish _n_ u VI, 6.\n\n[73:127](sbe3316.htm#fr_222) Identical with Manu VIII, 144. According to\nMedhatithi and Kulluka, the provision that the pledgee must make good the\nvalue of the pledge to the owner refers to those cases where the pledge has\nbeen injured or spoiled. According to Naraya _n_ a, whose opinion is\napparently shared by Asahaya, it means that the pledgee p. 74 must satisfy the\nowner of the pledge out of the profit derived from the use of the pledge.\n\n[74:128](sbe3316.htm#fr_223) Nearly identical with Manu VIII, 150. See\nProfessor Buhler's note.\n\n[74:129](sbe3316.htm#fr_224) 'A pledge for enjoyment' means one where the\nprofit derived from the pledge takes the place of interest. Such a pledge must\nnot be given or sold before the term fixed for its delivery. A.\n\n[74:130](sbe3316.htm#fr_225) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 60.\n\n[74:131](sbe3316.htm#fr_226) Where the debtor is unable to give another pledge\nor to restore the loan, he must he made to restore it successively, as best he\ncan, according to his receipts. A. Manu VIII, 177; IX, 229; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya\nII, 43.\n\n[74:132](sbe3316.htm#fr_227) The king shall take 5 per cent. as a compensation\nfor the assistance rendered by him. A. Manu VIII, 139; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II,\n42; Vish _n_ u VI, 21.\n\n[75:133](sbe3316.htm#fr_228) If the debtor, when impeached by the creditor,\nacknowledges the debt himself, the king shall take 10 per cent. only. If,\nhowever, the debtor had undergone the trouble of proving the correctness of\nhis demand against the creditor, the king shall take from him twice as much,\ni.e. 20 per cent. A. Manu VIII, 139 Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 42; Vish _n_ u VI,\n20, 21.\n\n[75:134](sbe3316.htm#fr_229) If a debtor, who has been cast in a suit, has not\nmeans sufficient to discharge the whole debt, he shall give a written bond. A.\nThe meaning of the obscure terms _g_ ati, sa _m_ _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, adhivasa may be\ngathered from a text of B _ri_ haspati, which is quoted in Nandapa _n_ _d_\nita's Vai _g_ ayanti (MS.) III, 74. There these three terms occur in an\nenumeration of ten points which have to be noticed in a written deed\nconcerning landed property. According to Nandapa _n_ _d_ ita, _g_ ati denotes\nthe caste, Brahmanical or other, of the plaintiff and defendant; sa _m_ _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ a denotes their names, as e.g. Devadatta; adhivasa refers to the names of\ntheir neighbours.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 10.
