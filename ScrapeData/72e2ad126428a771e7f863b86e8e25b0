Battle-charm for confusing the enemy.\n\n1\\. Agni, our skilful vanguard, shall attack, burning, against their schemes\nand hostile plans! Gatavedas shall bewilder the plans of the enemy, and\ndeprive them (of the use) of their hands!  \n2\\. This fire has confused the schemes that are in your mind; it shall blow\nyou from your home, blow you away from everywhere!  \n3\\. O Indra, bewildering their schemes, come hither with thy (own) plan: with\nthe impact of the fire and the wind scatter them to either side!  \n4\\. O ye plans of theirs, fly ye away; O ye schemes, be ye confused! Moreover,\nwhat now is in their mind, do thou drive that out of them!  \n5\\. Do thou, O (goddess) Apvi, confusing their plans, go forth (to them), and\nseize their limbs! Attack them, burn with flames into their hearts; strike the\nenemy with fits, (strike our) opponents with darkness!  \n6\\. That army yonder o( the enemy, that comes against us fighting with might,\ndo ye, O Maruts, strike with planless darkness, that one of them shall not\nknow the other!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 97.
