XXI.\n\nFuture kings. Descendants of Parikshit, ending with Kshemaka.\n\nI WILL now enumerate the kings who, will reign in future periods 1. The\npresent monarch, Parikshit 2, will have four sons, Janamejaya, \xc5\x9arutasena,\nUgrasena, and Bhimasena 3. The son of Janamejaya will be \xc5\x9aatanika 4, who will\nstudy the Vedas under Yajnyawalkya, and military science with Kripa; but\nbecoming dissatisfied with sensual enjoyments, he will acquire spiritual\nknowledge from the instructions of \xc5\x9aaunaka, and ultimately obtain salvation.\nHis son will be Aswamedhadatta (a son given by the gods in reward for the\nsacrifice of a horse 5); his son will be Asima-krishn\xcc\x81a 6; his son will be\nNichakra 7, who will remove the capital to Kau\xc5\x9bambi, in consequence of\nHastinapura being washed away by the Ganges; his son will be Ushn\xcc\x81a 8; his son\nwill be Chitraratha; his son\n\np. 462\n\nwill be Vrishn\xcc\x81imat 9; his son will be Sushen\xcc\x81a; his son will be Sunitha 10;\nhis son will be Richa 11; his son will be Nrichakshu 12; his son will be\nSukhihala 13; his son will be Pariplava; his son will be Sunaya 14; his son\nwill be Medhavin; his son will be Nripanjaya 15; his son will be Mridu 16; his\nson will be Tigma 17; his son will be Vrihadratha; his son will be Vasudana\n18; and his son will be another \xc5\x9aatanika; his son will be Udayana 19; his son\nwill be Ahinara 20; his son will be Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81apani 21; his son will be Niramitra\n22; his son will be Kshemaka 23: of him this verse is recited; "The race which\ngave origin to Brahmans and Kshatriyas, and which was purified by regal sages,\nterminated with Kshemaka; in the Kali age 24."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[461:1](vp114.htm#fr_1284) The style now adopted is that of prophecy, as Vyasa\ncould not consistently have recorded the events which were posterior to his\ntime.\n\n[461:2](vp114.htm#fr_1285) Also read Parikshita, Pariksha, and Parikshi.\n\n[461:3](vp114.htm#fr_1286) See [p. 457](vp113.htm#page_457). The Vayu and\nMatsya relate, rather obscurely, a dispute between Janamejaya and\nVai\xc5\x9bampayana, in consequence of the former\'s patronage of the Brahmans of the\nVajasaneyi branch of the Yajur-veda, in opposition to the latter, who was the\nauthor of the black or original Yajush (see [p. 279](vp079.htm#page_279)).\nJanamejaya twice performed the A\xc5\x9bwamedha according to the Vajasaneyi ritual,\nand established the Trisarvi, or use of certain texts by A\xc5\x9bmaka and others, by\nthe Brahmans of Anga, and by those of the middle country. He perished however\nin consequence, being cursed by Vai\xc5\x9bampayana. Before their disagreement,\nVai\xc5\x9bampayana related the Mahabharata to Janamejaya. Mahabh., Adi Parvan.\n\n[461:4](vp114.htm#fr_1287) The reading of the text is rather, \'his\n(Parikshit\'s) other son will be \xc5\x9aatanika;\' but the commentator refers \'his\' to\nJanamejaya. The Vayu, Matsya, and Bhagavata also make \xc5\x9aatanika the son of\nJanamejaya. The Brahma P. has a totally different series, or Parikshit,\nSuryapid\xcc\x81a, Chandrapid\xcc\x81a, Janamejaya, Satyakarn\xcc\x81a, \xc5\x9awetakarn\xcc\x81a, Sukumara, and\nAja\xc5\x9byama.\n\n[461:5](vp114.htm#fr_1288) The Bhagavata interposes Sahasranika. The\nVrihatkatha has the same descent, but calls the son of Sahasranika, Udayana or\nVatsa. The Bhagavata has A\xc5\x9bwamedhaja.\n\n[461:6](vp114.htm#fr_1289) Adhisama k.: Vayu. Adhisoma k.: Matsya. The former\nstates that the Vayu P. was narrated in this king\'s reign, in the second year\nof a three years\' sacrifice at Kurukshetra.\n\n[461:7](vp114.htm#fr_1290) Nemichakra: Bhagav. Vichakshus: Matsya. They agree\nwith the text as to the removal of the capital, and the cause.\n\n[461:8](vp114.htm#fr_1291) Ukta: Bhag. Bhurijyesht\xcc\x81ha: Matsya.\n\n[462:9](vp114.htm#fr_1292) Suchidratna, Vayu; Suchidrava, Mats.; Kaviratha,\nBhag.; is interposed between Chitraratha and Vrishnimat.\n\n[462:10](vp114.htm#fr_1293) Sutirtha: Vayu.\n\n[462:11](vp114.htm#fr_1294) Ruchi: Vayu. Omitted: Mats. and Bhag.\n\n[462:12](vp114.htm#fr_1295) Chitraksha: Vayu.\n\n[462:13](vp114.htm#fr_1296) Sukhinala: Bhag.\n\n[462:14](vp114.htm#fr_1297) Sutapas: Mats.\n\n[462:15](vp114.htm#fr_1298) Puranjaya: Mats.\n\n[462:16](vp114.htm#fr_1299) \xc3\x9arva: Mats. Durva: Bhag.\n\n[462:17](vp114.htm#fr_1300) Tigmatman: Mats. Timi: Bhagavata.\n\n[462:18](vp114.htm#fr_1301) Sudasa: Bhag. Vasudaman: Mats.\n\n[462:19](vp114.htm#fr_1302) The Matsya concurs with the text (see above, note\n5); the Bhagavata has Durdamana.\n\n[462:20](vp114.htm#fr_1303) Vahinara: Bhag.\n\n[462:21](vp114.htm#fr_1304) Dan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81apani: Bhag., Vayu, Mats.\n\n[462:22](vp114.htm#fr_1305) Nimi: Bhag.\n\n[462:23](vp114.htm#fr_1306) Kshepaka: Vayu.\n\n[462:24](vp114.htm#fr_1307) The same memorial verse is quoted in the Matsya\nand Vayu P., preceded by one which states the number of princes twenty-five.\nThe specification however, commencing with \xc5\x9aatanika, is twenty-six or twenty-\nseven. The passage is, ###.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXII](vp115.htm)\n\n'
