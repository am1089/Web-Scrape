There is meaning of the soul's going (only) on the twofold hypothesis;\nfor otherwise there is contradiction.\n\nIt is only on the hypothesis of a part of the good and evil works being left\nbehind at the time of the soul's departure from the body, and another part\nlater on, and the effacement of works thus taking place in a double way, that\na sense can be found in the scriptural declaration of the soul proceeding on\nthe path of the gods. For otherwise there would be a contradiction. For if all\nthe works perished at the time of the soul's departure from the body, the\nsubtle body also would perish, and if this were so, no going on the part of\nthe mere Self would be possible. It is not therefore possible that at the time\nof the soul's departure from the body all works should perish without a\nremainder.--To this the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 30. That assumption is justified; on account of the perception of\nthings which are marks of that; as in ordinary experience](sbe48414.htm)\n\n"
