The _Ri_ _k_ s are this (earth), since it is thereon that he who\nsings them, does sing them; the _Ri_ _k_ s are speech, since it is by speech\nthat he who sings them, does sing them. And the Ya _g_ us, forsooth, are the\nair, and the Samans the sky. That same threefold science is used in the Soma-\nsacrifice.\n\n4:6:7:22\\. By the _Ri_ _k_ he conquers this world, by the Ya _g_ us the air,\nand by the Saman the sky. Therefore whosoever has learnt one of these\nsciences, let him endeavour to learn also what is contained in the two others:\nby the _Ri_ _k_ , forsooth, he conquers this world, by the Ya _g_ us the air,\nand by the Saman the sky.\n\n4:6:7:33\\. This, then, is the thousandfold progeny of Va _k_ (speech) 1. Indra\n(obtained for his share) two-thirds, and Vish _n_ u one-third 2: the _Ri_ _k_\ns and Samans are Indra, and the Ya _g_ us are Vish _n_ u. Therefore in the\nSadas they perform (the _S_ astras and Stotras) with the _Ri_ _k_ and Saman,\nfor the Sadas is Indra's own.\n\n4:6:7:44\\. And by means of these Ya _g_ us they, as it were, bring forward\n(puras) that Vish _n_ u, the sacrifice: hence the name 'pura _s_ _k_ ara _n_\na' (preparatory ceremony).\n\np. 437\n\n4:6:7:55\\. Both the _Ri_ _k_ s and the Samans are Speech, and the Ya _g_ us\nare the Mind. Now wherever this Speech was, there everything was done,\neverything was known; but wherever Mind was, there nothing whatever was done,\nnothing was known, for no one knows (understands) those who think in their\nmind.\n\n4:6:7:66\\. The gods said to Speech, 'Go thou forward and make this known!' She\nsaid, 'What will be my reward then?'--'Whatever in the sacrifice is offered\nwith Svaha, and without Vasha _t_ , that shall be thine!' Hence whatever in\nthe sacrifice is offered with Svaha, and without Vasha _t_ , that belongs to\nSpeech. She then went forward and made that known, saying, 'Do this so! do\nthis so!'\n\n4:6:7:77\\. Therefore they also perform with the _Ri_ _k_ in the Havirdhana: he\n(the Hot _ri_ ) recites the morning prayer, he recites the kindling-verses; he\n(the Gravastut) praises the pressing-stones,--for thus, indeed, they (Speech\nand Mind) became yoke-fellows.\n\n4:6:7:88\\. And hence they also perform with the Ya _g_ us in the Sadas: they\nraise up the Udumbara post, they erect the Sadas, they throw up the dhish _n_\nya hearths,--for thus they became yoke-fellows.\n\n4:6:7:99\\. That same Sadas they enclose on all sides with a view to that\ngeneration, thinking, 'Quite secretly shall be carried on that generation!'\nfor improper, indeed, is the generation which another sees hence even when a\nhusband and wife are seen, while carrying on intercourse, they run away from\neach other, for they give offence. Therefore to any one looking into the\nSadas, except through the door, let him say, 'Look not!' for it is as if he\nwere seeing intercourse being carried on. Freely (one may look) through the\ndoor, for the door is made by the gods.\n\np. 438\n\n4:6:7:1010\\. In like manner they enclose the Havirdhana on all sides with a\nview to that generation, thinking, 'Quite secretly this generation shall be\ncarried on!' for improper, indeed, is the generation which another sees: hence\neven when a husband and wife are seen, while carrying on intercourse, they run\naway from each other, for they give offence. Therefore to any one looking into\nthe Havirdhana, except through the door, let him say, 'Look not!' for it is as\nif he were seeing intercourse being carried on. Freely (one may look) through\nthe door, for the door is made by the gods.\n\n4:6:7:1111\\. Now there, in the Sadas, that male, the Saman, longs after the\nfemale, the _Ri_ _k_. From that generation Indra was produced: from fire,\nindeed, fire is produced, viz. Indra from the _Ri_ _k_ and the Saman; for\nIndra they call him that burns yonder (the sun).\n\n4:6:7:1212\\. And there, in the Havirdhana, that male, the Soma, longs after\nthe female, the water. From that generation the moon was produced: from food,\nindeed, food is produced, viz. the moon from water and Soma; for the moon is\nthe food of him that burns yonder 1. Hence he thereby produces the sacrificer,\nand for him he produces food: from the _Ri_ _k_ and Saman he produces the\nsacrificer, and from water and Soma he produces food for him.\n\n4:6:7:1313\\. Now with the Ya _g_ us the gods first performed sacrifice, then\nwith the _Ri_ _k_ , then with the Saman and in like manner do they now perform\nthe sacrifice. first with the Ya _g_ us, then with the _Ri_ _k_ , then with\nthe Saman; for Ya _g_ us, they say, is the same as Ya _g_ as (worship).\n\n4:6:7:1414\\. Now when the gods milked (the objects of) their wishes from these\nsciences, the Ya _g_ us science\n\np. 439\n\nmilked most wishes. It became, as it were, emptied the most; it was not equal\nto the other two sciences,--the air-world was not equal to the two other\nworlds.\n\n4:6:7:1515\\. The gods desired, 'How can this science become equal to the other\ntwo sciences; how can the air-world become equal to the two other worlds?'\n\n4:6:7:1616\\. They said, 'Let us perform in a low voice with the Ya _g_ us:\nthen that science will become equal to the other two sciences; then the air-\nworld will become equal to the two other worlds!'\n\n4:6:7:1717\\. They performed with them in a low voice, and thereby strengthened\nthem; and henceforth that science was equal to the other two sciences, and the\nair-world was equal to the two other worlds. Therefore the Ya _g_ us, while\nbeing distinct, are yet indistinct; and therefore the air-world, while being\ndistinct, is yet indistinct (indefinable).\n\n4:6:7:1818\\. He who performs with the Ya _g_ us in a low voice, strengthens\nthem; and they, thus strengthened, strengthen him. But he who performs in a\nloud voice, weakens them, and, being weak, they weaken him.\n\n4:6:7:1919\\. The _Ri_ _k_ s and Samans, forsooth, are speech, and the Ya _g_\nus are the mind; and so those who perform with the _Ri_ _k_ and Saman are\nspeech, and those who perform with the Ya _g_ us are the mind. Hence nothing\nwhatever is done, unless ordered by the Adhvaryu: when the Adhvaryu says,\n'Recite (the invitatory prayer)! Pronounce the offering prayer!' then those\nwho perform with the _Ri_ k perform it. And when the Adhvaryu says, 'Soma\nbecometh pure: turn ye back 1!' then those who perform with the Saman perform\nit,--for speech speaks not but what is conceived by the mind.\n\np. 440\n\n4:6:7:2020\\. Thus, then, the Adhvaryu, the mind, walks, as it were, in front\n(pura _s_ - _k_ arati): hence the name 'pura _s_ _k_ ara _n_ a 1;' and verily,\nhe who knows this, stands, as it were, in front through prosperity and glory.\n\n4:6:7:2121\\. Now that same pura _s_ _k_ ara _n_ a (going before) is nothing\nelse than yonder burning (sun): one ought to perform in accordance with his\n(the sun's) course. When he (the Adhvaryu) has drawn a cup of Soma, let him\nturn round in accordance with his course; when he has responded (to the Hot\n_ri_ 's recitation), let him turn round in accordance with his course; when he\nhas offered a graha, let him turn round in accordance with his course: he (the\nsun), verily, is the supporter; and whosoever, knowing this, is able to\nperform in accordance with his course, he, forsooth, is able to support his\ndependants 2.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[436:1](sbe2676.htm#fr_1018) See [IV, 5, 8, 4](sbe2667.htm#4:5:8:4).\n\n[436:2](sbe2676.htm#fr_1019) Thus according to the Ka _n_ va text,--dvau\nbhagav indro 'bha _g_ ataika _m_ vish _n_ u _h_.\n\n[438:1](sbe2676.htm#fr_1020) See I, 6, 4, 13 seq.\n\n[439:1](sbe2676.htm#fr_1021) See [IV, 2, 5, 8](sbe2649.htm#4:2:5:8).\n\n[440:1](sbe2676.htm#fr_1022) That is, preparation, preparatory ceremony;--and\nhence also the 'taking the lead, being the precursor.'\n\n[440:2](sbe2676.htm#fr_1023) In the Ka _n_ va text this is the last Brahma _n_\na of the (fifth) Ka _n_ _d_ a.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 6, 8.
