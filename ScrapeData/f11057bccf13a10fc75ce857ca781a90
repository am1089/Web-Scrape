He traversed the dark unseen,\nleaving the track of his song across the hush of the evening.\n\nHis village home lay there at the end of the waste land, beyond the sugar-cane\nfield, hidden among the shadows of the banana and the slender areca palm, the\ncocoa-nut and the dark green jack-fruit trees.\n\nI stopped for a moment in my lonely way under the starlight, and saw spread\nbefore me the darkened earth surrounding with her arms countless homes\nfurnished with cradles and beds, mothers' hearts and evening lamps, and young\nlives glad with a gladness that knows nothing of its value for the world.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: On The Seashore](cm04.htm)\n\n"
