[2b](ry317.htm#fn_733)  \nWith ten tall stems, a palm between  \nMeru and Asta\'s hill is seen:  \nPure silver from the base it springs,  \nAnd far and wide its lustre flings.  \nSeek Ravanthe dame by brook,  \nIn pathless glen, in leafy nook  \nOn Meru\'s crest a hermit lives  \nBright with the light that penance gives:  \nSavarni  [3b](ry317.htm#fn_734) is he named, renowned  \nAs Brahma\'s peer, with glory crowned.  \nThere bowing down in reverence speak  \nAnd ask him of the dame you seek.  \nThus far the splendid Lord of Day  \nPursues through heaven his ceaseless way,  \nShedding on every spot his light;  \nThen sinks behind Mount Asta\'s height,  \nThus far advance: the sunless sea  \nBeyond is all unknown to me.  \nSushen of mighty arm, long tried  \nIn peril, shall your legions guide,  \nReceive his words with high respect,  \nAnd ne\'er his lightest wish neglect.  \nHe is my consort\'s sire, and hence  \nDeserves the utmost reverence.\'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[376:1](ry315.htm#fr_714) S\'ailusha, Gramini, Siksha, Suka, Babhru.\n\n[376:2](ry315.htm#fr_715) The distant south beyond the confines of the earth\nis the home of departed spirits and the city of Yama the God of Death.\n\n[376:3](ry316.htm#fr_716) Surashtra, the \'good country,\' is the modern Surat.\n\n[376:4](ry316.htm#fr_717) A country north-west of Afghanistan, Baikh\n\n[376:1b](ry316.htm#fr_718) The Moon-mountain here is mythical.\n\n[376:2b](ry316.htm#fr_719) Sindhu is the Indus.\n\n[376:3b](ry316.htm#fr_720) Pariyatra, or as more usually written Paripatra, is\nthe central or western portion of the Vindhya chain which skirts the province\nof Malwa.\n\n[376:4b](ry316.htm#fr_721) Vajra means both diamond and thunderbolt, the two\nsubstances being supposed to be identical.\n\n[376:5b](ry316.htm#fr_722) Chakravan means the discus-bearer.\n\n[376:6b](ry316.htm#fr_723) The discus is the favourite weapon of Vishnu\n\n[376:7b](ry316.htm#fr_724) The Indian Hephaistos or Vulcan.\n\n[376:8b](ry316.htm#fr_725) Panchajan was a demon who lived in the sea in the\nform of a conch shell.
