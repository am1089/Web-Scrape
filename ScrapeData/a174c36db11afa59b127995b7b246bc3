Now when it is said, that the gods, by means of the Sakamedha\n-offerings, slew V _ri_ tra and gained that supreme authority which they now\nwield,--it is rather by means of all the Seasonal sacrifices that the gods\nslew V _ri_ tra; it is by all of them that they gained that supreme authority\nwhich they now wield.\n\n2:6:4:22\\. They spake, 'With what king, with what leader 1 shall we fight?'\nAgni spake, 'With me for your king, with me for your leader!' With Agni for\ntheir king, with Agni for their leader, they gained four months; and with the\nBrahman (sacerdotium) and the threefold science they encompassed them.\n\n2:6:4:33\\. They spake, 'With what king, with what leader shall we fight?' Varu\n_n_ a spake, 'With me for your king, with me for your leader!' With Varu _n_ a\nfor their king, with Varu _n_ a for their leader, they gained other four\nmonths; and with the Brahman and the threefold science they encompassed them.\n\n2:6:4:44\\. They spake, 'With what king, with what leader shall we fight?'\nIndra spake, 'With me for your king, with me for your leader!' With Indra for\ntheir king, with Indra for their leader, they gained other four months; and\nwith the Brahman and the threefold science they encompassed them.\n\np. 450\n\n2:6:4:55\\. And, accordingly, when he performs the Vai _s_ vadeva, he thereby\ngains four months, with Agni for his king, with Agni for his leader. Then (in\nshaving) are used a porcupine's quill spotted in three places, and a copper\nrazor; that three-spotted porcupine's quill resembles the threefold science,\nand the copper razor resembles the Brahman; for the Brahman is fire, and fire\nis of reddish (lohita) colour: hence a copper (loha) razor is used. Therewith\nhe has (his head) shaved all round 1; and thus he (the Adhvaryu) encompasses\nhim with the Brahman and the threefold science.\n\n2:6:4:66\\. And when he performs the Varu _n_ apraghasa offerings, he thereby\ngains other four months, with Varu _n_ a for his king, with Varu _n_ a for his\nleader. Then a three-spotted quill of a porcupine and a copper razor are used,\nwherewith he has himself shaved all round; and thus he (the priest)\nencompasses him with the Brahman and the threefold science.\n\n2:6:4:77\\. And when he performs the Sakamedha offerings, he thereby gains\nother four months, with Indra for his king, with Indra for his leader. Then a\nthree-spotted quill of a porcupine and a copper razor are used, wherewith he\nhas himself shaved; and thus he (the priest) encompasses him with the Brahman\nand the threefold science.\n\n2:6:4:88\\. And when he performs the Vai _s_ vadeva, then he becomes Agni, and\nattains to union with Agni and to co-existence in his world. And when he\nperforms the Varu _n_ apraghasa offerings, then he becomes Varu _n_ a, and\nattains to union with Varu _n_ a\n\np. 451\n\nand to co-existence in his world. And when he performs the Sakamedha\nofferings, then he becomes Indra, and attains to union with Indra and to\ncoexistence in his world 1.\n\n2:6:4:99\\. And in whatever season he goes to yonder world, that season passes\nhim on to the next season, and that season again passes him on to the next\nseason,--he who performs the Seasonal sacrifices reaches the highest place,\nthe supreme goal. Wherefore it is said, 'They find not him that offereth the\nSeasonal offerings, for verily he goeth unto the highest place, to the supreme\ngoal 2.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[449:1](sbe1263.htm#fr_1008) Anika (?
