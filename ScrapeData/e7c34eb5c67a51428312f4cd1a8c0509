If it be objected that (from the doctrine expounded hitherto) there would\nresult the fault of there being no room for (certain) Sm _ri_ tis; we do not\nadmit that objection, because (from the rejection of our doctrine) there would\nresult the fault of want of room for other Sm _ri_ tis.\n\nIt has been shown in the first adhyaya that the omniscient Lord of all is the\ncause of the origin of this world in the same way as clay is the material\ncause of jars and gold of golden ornaments; that by his rulership he is the\ncause of the subsistence of this world once originated, just as the magician\nis the cause of the subsistence of the magical illusion; and that he, lastly,\nis the cause of this emitted world being finally reabsorbed into his essence,\njust as the four classes of creatures are reabsorbed into the earth. It has\nfurther been proved, by a demonstration of the connected meaning of all the\nVedanta-texts, that the Lord is the Self of all of us. Moreover, the doctrines\nof the pradhana, and so on, being the cause of this world have been refuted as\nnot being scriptural.--The purport of the second adhyaya, which we now begin,\nis to refute the objections (to the doctrine established hitherto) which might\nbe founded on Sm _ri_ ti and Reasoning, and to show that the doctrines of the\npradhana, &c. have only fallacious arguments to lean upon, and that the\ndifferent Vedanta-texts do not contradict one another with regard to the mode\nof creation and similar topics.--The first point is to refute the objections\nbased on Sm _ri_ ti.\n\nYour doctrine (the purvapakshin says) that the omniscient\n\np. 291\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahman only is the cause of this world cannot be\nmaintained, 'because there results from it the fault of there being no room\nfor (certain) Sm _ri_ tis.' Such Sm _ri_ tis are the one called Tantra which\nwas composed by a _ri_ shi and is accepted by authoritative persons, and other\nSm _ri_ tis based on it 1; for all of which there would be no room if your\ninterpretation of the Veda were the true one. For they all teach that the non-\nintelligent pradhana is the independent cause of the world. There is indeed\nroom (a raison d'etre) for Sm _ri_ tis like the Manu-sm _ri_ ti, which give\ninformation about matters connected with the whole body of religious duty,\ncharacterised by injunction 2 and comprising the agnihotra and similar\nperformances. They tell us at what time and with what rites the members of the\ndifferent castes are to be initiated; how the Veda has to be studied; in what\nway the cessation of study has to take place; how marriage has to be\nperformed, and so on. They further lay down the manifold religious duties,\nbeneficial to man, of the four castes and a _s_ ramas 3. The Kapila Sm _ri_\nti, on the other hand, and similar books are not concerned with things to be\ndone, but were composed with exclusive reference to perfect knowledge as the\nmeans of final release. If then no room were left for them in that connexion\nalso, they would be altogether purposeless; and hence we must explain the\nVedanta-texts in such a manner as not to bring them into conflict with the Sm\n_ri_ tis mentioned 4.--But how, somebody may ask the purvapakshin, can the\neventual fault of there being left no room for certain Sm _ri_ tis be used as\nan objection against that sense of _S_ ruti which--from various\n\np. 292\n\nreasons as detailed under I, 1 and ff.--has been ascertained by us to be the\ntrue one, viz. that the omniscient Brahman alone is the cause of the world?--\nOur objection, the purvapakshin replies, will perhaps not appear valid to\npersons of independent thought; but as most men depend in their reasonings on\nothers, and are unable to ascertain by themselves the sense of _S_ ruti, they\nnaturally rely on Sm _ri_ tis, composed by celebrated authorities, and try to\narrive at the sense of _S_ ruti with their assistance; while, owing to their\nesteem for the authors of the Sm _ri_ tis, they have no trust in our\nexplanations. The knowledge of men like Kapila Sm _ri_ ti declares to have\nbeen _ri_ shi-like and unobstructed, and moreover there is the following _S_\nruti-passage, 'It is he who, in the beginning, bears in his thoughts the son,\nthe _ri_ shi, kapila 1, whom he wishes to look on while he is born' ( _S_ ve.\nUp. V, 2). Hence their opinion cannot be assumed to be erroneous, and as they\nmoreover strengthen their position by argumentation, the objection remains\nvalid, and we must therefore attempt to explain the Vedanta-texts in\nconformity with the Sm _ri_ tis.\n\nThis objection we dispose of by the remark, 'It is not so because therefrom\nwould result the fault of want of room for other Sm _ri_ tis.'--If you object\nto the doctrine of the Lord being the cause of the world on the ground that it\nwould render certain Sm _ri_ tis purposeless, you thereby render purposeless\nother Sm _ri_ tis which declare themselves in favour of the said doctrine.\nThese latter Sm _ri_ ti-texts we will quote in what follows. In one passage\nthe highest Brahman is introduced as the subject of discussion, 'That which is\nsubtle and not to be known;' the text then goes on, 'That is the internal Self\nof the creatures, their soul,' and after that remarks 'From that sprang the\nUnevolved, consisting of the three gu _n_ as, O best of Brahma _n_ as.' And in\nanother place it is said that 'the Unevolved is\n\np. 293\n\ndissolved in the Person devoid of qualities, O Brahma _n_ a.'--Thus we read\nalso in the Pura _n_ a, 'Hear thence this short statement: The ancient Naraya\n_n_ a is all this; he produces the creation at the due time, and at the time\nof reabsorption he consumes it again.' And so in the Bhagavadgita also (VII,\n6), 'I am the origin and the place of reabsorption of the whole world.' And\n\xc3\x82pastamba too says with reference to the highest Self, 'From him spring all\nbodies; he is the primary cause, he is eternal, he is unchangeable' (Dharma\nSutra I, 8, 23, 2). In this way Sm _ri_ ti, in many places, declares the Lord\nto be the efficient as well as the material cause of the world. As the\npurvapakshin opposes us on the ground of Sm _ri_ ti, we reply to him on the\nground of Sm _ri_ ti only; hence the line of defence taken up in the Sutra.\nNow it has been shown already that the _S_ ruti-texts aim at conveying the\ndoctrine that the Lord is the universal cause, and as wherever different Smr\n_it_ is conflict those maintaining one view must be accepted, while those\nwhich maintain the opposite view must be set aside, those Sm _ri_ tis which\nfollow _S_ ruti are to be considered as authoritative, while all others are to\nbe disregarded; according to the Sutra met with in the chapter treating of the\nmeans of proof (Mim. Sutra I, 3, 3), 'Where there is contradiction (between\n_S_ ruti and Sm _ri_ ti) (Sm _ri_ ti) is to be disregarded; in case of there\nbeing no (contradiction) (Sm _ri_ ti is to be recognised) as there is\ninference (of Sm _ri_ ti being founded on _S_ ruti).'--Nor can we assume that\nsome persons are able to perceive supersensuous matters without _S_ ruti, as\nthere exists no efficient cause for such perception. Nor, again, can it be\nsaid that such perception may be assumed in the case of Kapila and others who\npossessed supernatural powers, and consequently unobstructed power of\ncognition. For the possession of supernatural powers itself depends on the\nperformance of religious duty, and religious duty is that which is\ncharacterised by injunction 1; hence the sense of injunctions (i.e. of the\nVeda)\n\np. 294\n\nwhich is established first must not be fancifully interpreted in reference to\nthe dicta of men 'established' (i.e. made perfect, and therefore possessing\nsupernatural powers) afterwards only. Moreover, even if those 'perfect' men\nwere accepted as authorities to be appealed to, still, as there are many such\nperfect men, we should have, in all those cases where the Sm _ri_ tis\ncontradict each other in the manner described, no other means of final\ndecision than an appeal to _S_ ruti.--As to men destitute of the power of\nindependent judgment, we are not justified in assuming that they will without\nany reason attach themselves to some particular Sm _ri_ ti; for if men's\ninclinations were so altogether unregulated, truth itself would, owing to the\nmultiformity of human opinion, become unstable. We must therefore try to lead\ntheir judgment in the right way by pointing out to them the conflict of the Sm\n_ri_ tis, and the distinction founded on some of them following _S_ ruti and\nothers not.--The scriptural passage which the purvapakshin has quoted as\nproving the eminence of Kapila's knowledge would not justify us in believing\nin such doctrines of Kapila (i.e. of some Kapila) as are contrary to\nScripture; for that passage mentions the bare name of Kapila (without\nspecifying which Kapila is meant), and we meet in tradition with another\nKapila, viz. the one who burned the sons of Sagara and had the surname\nVasudeva. That passage, moreover, serves another purpose, (viz. the\nestablishment of the doctrine of the highest Self,; and has on that account no\nforce to prove what is not proved by any other means, (viz. the supereminence\nof Kapila's knowledge.) On the other hand, we have a _S_ ruti-passage which\nproclaims the excellence of Manu 1, viz. 'Whatever Manu said is medicine'\n(Taitt. Sa _m_ h. II, 2, 10, 2). Manu himself, where he glorifies the seeing\nof the one Self in everything ('he who equally sees the Self in all beings and\nall beings in the Self, he as a sacrificer to the Self attains self-\nluminousness,'\n\np. 295\n\ni.e. becomes Brahman, Manu Sm _ri_ ti XII, 91), implicitly blames the doctrine\nof Kapila. For Kapila, by acknowledging a plurality of Selfs, does not admit\nthe doctrine of there being one universal Self. In the Mahabharata also the\nquestion is raised whether there are many persons (souls) or one; thereupon\nthe opinion of others is mentioned, 'There are many persons, O King, according\nto the Sa _n_ khya and Yoga philosophers;' that opinion is controverted 'just\nas there is one place of origin, (viz. the earth,) for many persons, so I will\nproclaim to you that universal person raised by his qualities;' and, finally,\nit is declared that there is one universal Self, 'He is the internal Self of\nme, of thee, and of all other embodied beings, the internal witness of all,\nnot to be apprehended by any one. He the all-headed, all-armed, all-footed,\nall-eyed, all-nosed one moves through all beings according to his will and\nliking.' And Scripture also declares that there is one universal Self, 'When\nto a man who understands the Self has become all things, what sorrow, what\ntrouble can there be to him who once beheld that unity?' (\xc3\x8e _s_. Up 7); and\nother similar passages. All which proves that the system of Kapila contradicts\nthe Veda, and the doctrine of Manu who follows the Veda, by its hypothesis of\na plurality of Selfs also, not only by the assumption of an independent\npradhana. The authoritativeness of the Veda with regard to the matters stated\nby it is independent and direct, just as the light of the sun is the direct\nmeans of our knowledge of form and colour; the authoritativeness of human\ndicta, on the other hand, is of an altogether different kind, as it depends on\nan extraneous basis (viz. the Veda), and is (not immediate but) mediated by a\nchain of teachers and tradition.\n\nHence the circumstance that the result (of our doctrine) is want of room for\ncertain Sm _ri_ tis, with regard to matters contradicted by the Veda,\nfurnishes no valid objection.--An additional reason for this our opinion is\nsupplied by the following Sutra.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[291:1](sbe34140.htm#fr_257) The Sm _ri_ ti called Tantra is the Sa _n_ khya\n_s_ astra as taught by Kapila; the Sm _ri_ ti-writers depending on him are\n\xc3\x82suri, Pa _\xc3\xb1 k_a _s_ ikha, and others.\n\n[291:2](sbe34140.htm#fr_258) Mima _m_ sa Su.
