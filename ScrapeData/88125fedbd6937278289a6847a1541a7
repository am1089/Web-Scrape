But _G_ aimini thinks that (the reference to the individual soul) has\nanother purport, on account of\n\np. 273\n\nthe question and answer; and thus some also (read in their text).\n\nWhether the passage under discussion is concerned with the individual soul or\nwith Brahman, is, in the opinion of the teacher _G_ aimini, no matter for\ndispute, since the reference to the individual soul has a different purport,\ni.e. aims at intimating Brahman. He founds this his opinion on a question and\na reply met with in the text. After A _g_ ata _s_ atru has taught Balaki, by\nwaking the sleeping man, that the soul is different from the vital air, he\nasks the following question, 'Balaki, where did this person here sleep? Where\nwas he? Whence came he thus back?' This question clearly refers to something\ndifferent from the individual soul. And so likewise does the reply, 'When\nsleeping he sees no dream, then he becomes one with that pra _n_ a alone;'\nand, 'From that Self all pra _n_ as proceed, each towards its place, from the\npra _n_ as the gods, from the gods the worlds.'--Now it is the general Vedanta\ndoctrine that at the time of deep sleep the soul becomes one with the highest\nBrahman, and that from the highest Brahman the whole world proceeds, inclusive\nof pra _n_ a, and so on. When Scripture therefore represents as the object of\nknowledge that in which there takes place the deep sleep of the soul,\ncharacterised by absence of consciousness and utter tranquillity, i.e. a state\ndevoid of all those specific cognitions which are produced by the limiting\nadjuncts of the soul, and from which the soul returns when the sleep is\nbroken; we understand that the highest Self is meant.--Moreover, the Va _g_\nasaneyi _s_ akha, which likewise contains the colloquy of Balaki and A _g_ ata\n_s_ atru, clearly refers to the individual soul by means of the term, 'the\nperson consisting of cognition' (vi _g \xc3\xb1_anamaya), and distinguishes from it\nthe highest Self ('Where was then the person consisting of cognition? and from\nwhence did he thus come back?' B _ri_. Up. II, 1, 16); and later on, in the\nreply to the above question, declares that 'the person consisting of cognition\nlies in the ether within the heart.' Now we know that the word 'ether' may be\nused to denote the highest Self, as, for instance, in\n\np. 274\n\nthe passage about the small ether within the lotus of the heart ( _Kh_. Up.\nVIII, 1, 1). Further on the B _ri_. Up. says, 'All the Selfs came forth from\nthat Self;' by which statement of the coming forth of all the conditioned\nSelfs it intimates that the highest Self is the one general cause.--The\ndoctrine conveyed by the rousing of the sleeping person, viz. that the\nindividual soul is different from the vital air, furnishes at the same time a\nfurther argument against the opinion that the passage under discussion refers\nto the vital air.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4, 19](sbe34130.htm)\n\n"
