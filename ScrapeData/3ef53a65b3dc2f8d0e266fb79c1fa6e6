They now fix pegs round it 3,--a Pala _s_ a (Butea frondosa) one\nin front,--for the Pala _s_ a is the Brahman (n.): he thus makes him go to the\nheavenly world with the Brahman for his leader;--a _S_ ami (Prosopis\nspicigera) one on the left (north corner), in order that there may be peace (\n_s_ am) for him;--a Vara _n_ a (Crataeva Roxburghii) one behind, in order that\nhe may ward off (varaya) sin from him;--\n\np. 437\n\nand a V _ri_ tra-peg 1 on the right (south corner) for sin not to pass beyond.\n\n13:8:4:22\\. On the right (south) side they then dig two somewhat curved\n(furrows 2), and fill them with milk and water,--these, indeed, are two\ninexhaustible streams (that) flow to him in the other world;--and seven (they\ndig) on the left (north) side, and fill them with water, for sin not to pass\nbeyond, for indeed sin cannot pass beyond seven rivers 3.\n\n13:8:4:33\\. They 4 throw three stones each (into the northern furrows), and\npass over them, with (Va _g_. S. XXXV, 10; _Ri_ g-v. X, 53, 8): 'Here floweth\nthe stony one: hold on to each other, rise, and cross over, ye friends: here\nwill we leave behind what unkind spirits there be, and will cross over to\nauspicious nourishments;'--as the text so its import.\n\n13:8:4:44\\. They cleanse themselves with Apamarga plants 5\\--they thereby wipe\naway (apa-marg) sin--\n\np. 438\n\nwith (Va _g_. S. XXXV, 11), 'O Apamarga, drive thou away from us sin, away\nguilt, away witchery, away infirmity, away evil dreams!'--as the text so its\nimport.\n\n13:8:4:55\\. They bathe at any place where there is water. With (Va _g_. S.\nXXXV, 12), 'May the waters and plants be friendly unto us!' he takes water\nwith his joined hands,--for water is a thunderbolt: with the thunderbolt he\nthus makes friendship,--and with, 'Unfriendly may they be unto him who hateth\nus, and whom we hate!' he throws it in the direction in which he who is\nhateful to him may be, and thereby overthrows him.\n\n13:8:4:66\\. And if it be standing water, it makes their (the bathers') evil\nstop; and if it flows, it carries away their evil. Having bathed, and put on\ngarments that have never yet been washed, they hold on to the tail of an ox 1,\nand return (to their home),--for the ox is of Agni's nature: headed by Agni\nthey thus return from the world of the Fathers to the world of the living. And\nAgni, indeed, is he who leads one over the paths (one has to travel), and it\nis he who leads these over.\n\np. 439\n\n13:8:4:77\\. They proceed (towards the village) muttering this verse (Va _g_.\nS. XXXV, 14), 'From out of the gloom have we risen 1 . . .'--from the gloom,\nthe world of the Fathers, they now indeed approach the light, the sun. When\nthey have arrived, ointments for the eyes and the feet are given them: such,\nindeed, are human means of embellishment, and therewith they keep off death\nfrom themselves.\n\n13:8:4:88\\. Then, in the house, having made up the (domestic) fire, and laid\nenclosing-sticks of Vara _n_ a wood round it, he offers, by means of a sruva-\nspoon of Vara _n_ a wood, an oblation to Agni \xc3\x82yushmat 2, for Agni \xc3\x82yushmat\nrules over vital power: it is of him he asks vital power for these (the\nSacrificer's family). [Va _g_. S. XXXV, 16,] 'Thou, Agni, causest vital powers\nto flow: (send us food and drink, and keep calamity. far from us),' serves as\ninvitatory formula.\n\n13:8:4:99\\. He then offers, with (Va _g_. S. XXXV, 17), 'Long-lived be thou, O\nAgni, growing by offering, ghee-mouthed, ghee-born: drinking the sweet,\npleasant cow's ghee, guard thou these, as a father does his son, hail!' he\nthus says this so that he (Agni) may guard and protect these (men).\n\n13:8:4:1010\\. The sacrificial fee for this (ceremony) consists of an old ox,\nold barley, an old arm-chair with head-cushion--this at least is the\nprescribed Dakshi _n_ a, but he may give more according to his inclination.\nSuch, indeed, (is the performance) in the case of one who had built a fire-\naltar.\n\np. 440\n\n13:8:4:1111\\. And in the case of one who has not built a fire-altar, there is\nthe same mode of selecting the site (for the sepulchral mound) and the same\nperformance save that of the fire-altar. 'Let him use pebbles (instead of\nbricks 1) in the case of one who keeps up a sacrificial fire,' say some, 'they\nare just what those pebbles used at the Agnyadheya are 2.' 'Let him not use\nthem,' say others; 'surely they would be liable to weigh heavily upon one who\nhas not built a fire-altar.' Let him do as he pleases.\n\n13:8:4:1212\\. Having fetched a clod from the boundary, he 3 deposits it\n(midway) between (the grave and the village), with (Va _g_. S. XXXV, 15),\n'This I put up as a bulwark for the living, lest another of them should go\nunto that thing: may they live for a hundred plentiful harvests, and shut out\ndeath from themselves by a mountain!'--he thus makes this a boundary between\nthe Fathers and the living, so as not to commingle; and therefore, indeed, the\nliving and the Fathers are not seen together here.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[436:3](sbe44116.htm#fr_1165) According to Katy. Sr. XXI, the pegs are driven\nin immediately after the measuring, and prior to the sweeping, of the site of\nthe tumulus; and this must certainly be the case, seeing that the cords by\nwhich the site is enclosed ([XIII, 8, 1, 19](sbe44113.htm#13:8:1:19)) are\nfastened to the pegs.\n\n[437:1](sbe44116.htm#fr_1166) The exact meaning of 'v _ri_ tra- _s_ a\xe1\xb9\x85ku' is\ndoubtful. Katy. _S_ r. XXI, 3, 31 has 'deha- _s_ a\xe1\xb9\x85ku' instead, to which the\ncommentary assigns the rather improbable meaning of 'stone-pillar,' in favour\nof which he refers to IV, 2, 5, 15 of our Brahma _n_ a--'Soma, in truth, was V\n_ri_ tra: the mountains and stones are his body; 'whence he makes 'v _ri_ tra'\n= 'a _s_ man' (stone).\n\n[437:2](sbe44116.htm#fr_1167) Or narrow trenches or ditches--ku _t_ ile\nkarshu, Katy. XXI, 4, 20. They are apparently semicircular, probably with\ntheir open part towards the grave.\n\n[437:3](sbe44116.htm#fr_1168) These seven furrows are straight, running from\nwest to east; thus separating the grave from the north, the world of men.\n\n[437:4](sbe44116.htm#fr_1169) That is, the Adhvaryu and the members of the\nSacrificer's family.\n\n[437:5](sbe44116.htm#fr_1170) Lit. 'cleansing-plants' or 'wiping-plants,'\nAchyranthes aspera; also called the burr-plant (Birdwood), a common hairy weed\nfound all over India, and much used for incantations and sacrificial purposes.\n\n[438:1](sbe44116.htm#fr_1171) That is to say, one of them takes hold of the\ntail, whilst the others follow in single file, each holding on to the one\nwalking in front of him. Prof. Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, p. 21, note, refers to\nthe somewhat analogous practice of tying to the left arm of a dead man the\ntail of the anustara _n_ i-cow slain at the funeral sacrifice, whereby the\ndeceased is supposed to be led safely--across the river Vaitara _n_ i (Styx);\nsee Say. on Sha _d_ v. Br., as quoted Ind. Stud. I, p. 39; cf. also\nColebrooke, Misc. Essays, second ed., p. 192--to the world of the Fathers.\nAccording to Katy. XXI, 4, 24 the ceremony of taking hold of the tail is\nperformed with the verse, Va _g_. S. XXXV, 53, 'For our well-being we hold on\nto the ox, sprung from Surabhi: even as Indra to the gods, so be thou a saving\nleader unto us!'\n\n[439:1](sbe44116.htm#fr_1172) See [XII, 9, 2, 8](sbe44072.htm#12:9:2:8).\n\n[439:2](sbe44116.htm#fr_1173) I.e. imbued with vital power, long-lived.\n\n[440:1](sbe44116.htm#fr_1174) See [XIII, 8, 3, 6](sbe44115.htm#13:8:3:6).\n\n[440:2](sbe44116.htm#fr_1175) See II, 1, 1, 8 seqq.\n\n[440:3](sbe44116.htm#fr_1176) Viz. the Adhvaryu, according to Mahidhara on Va\n_g_. S. XXXV, 15. According to Katy. XXI, 4, 25, this ceremony takes place\nwhilst they are on their way back from the grave to the village; as indeed\nappears from the order in which the formula used appears in the Va _g_. Sa _m_\nhita. It is difficult to see why the author should not have given it in its\nright place, unless it was done with a view to a good conclusion to the Ka _n_\n_d_ a, or because he really wished it to he done after the performance of the\noffering. It is scarcely necessary to assume that this Ka _n_ _d_ ika is a\nlater addition, perhaps based on the Ka _n_ va recension.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIV, 1, 1.
