(There is absolute) non-division (from Brahman, of the parts merged in\nit); according to scriptural declaration.\n\nWhen the parts of him who knows are merged in Brahman, is there a remainder\n(which is not so merged), as in the case of other men; or is there no such\nremainder? As the merging of him also who knows falls under the general\nheading of merging, it might be assumed that of him also there remains a\npotential body, and the Sutrakara therefore teaches expressly that the\nelements, &c., of him who knows enter into the relation of (absolute) non-\ndivision from Brahman.--On what ground?--Because scripture declares this. For\nafter having taught the dissolution of the parts, the text continues, 'Their\nname and form are broken, and people speak of the person only; and he becomes\nwithout parts and immortal' (Pr. Up. VI, 5). And when parts that are due to\nnescience are dissolved\n\np. 377\n\nthrough knowledge it is not possible that a remainder should be left. The\nparts therefore enter into absolute non-division from Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 2, 17](sbe38297.htm)\n\n"
