And because there is a (separate) denotation of the object of activity and\nof the agent.\n\nThe attributes of consisting of mind, and so on, cannot belong to the embodied\nSelf for that reason also, that there is a (separate) denotation of the object\nof activity and of the agent. In the passage, 'When I shall have departed from\nhence I shall obtain him' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 14, 4), the word 'him' refers to\nthat which is the topic of discussion, viz. the Self which is to be meditated\nupon as possessing the attributes of consisting of mind, &c., as the object of\nan activity, viz. as something to be obtained; while the words, 'I shall\nobtain,' represent the meditating individual Self as the agent, i.e. the\nobtainer. Now, wherever it can be helped, we must not assume that one and the\nsame being is spoken of as the agent and the object of the activity at the\nsame time. The relation existing between a person meditating and the thing\nmeditated upon requires, moreover, different abodes.--And thus for the above\nreason, also, that which is characterised by the attributes of consisting of\nmind, and so on, cannot be the individual soul.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2, 5](sbe34042.htm)\n\n"
