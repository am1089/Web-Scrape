Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus giving the advice to his son, the King\nTris\xc2\x92anku was excited with feelings of love and, in a choked voice, said to\nhis father that he would fulfil what he had been ordered. The King then called\nthe Brahmi _n_ s, versed in the Vedas and Mantrams, and had all the materials\nfor installation collected quickly. He brought the waters from all the sacred\nplaces of prigrimages; he then called together with great respect all the\nkings. On a sacred day, the father installed his son on the throne and gave\nhim, in accordance with due rites and ceremonies, the royal throne. The King\nthen adopted with his wife the third Vanaprastha stage of life and practised a\nsevere tapasya on the\n\n\n\np. 633\n\n\n\nbanks of the Ganges. Then in due course of time the King went to the Heavens.\nThere he began to shine like a second Sun by the side of Indra, respected by\nall the gods.\n\n\n\n7-10. Janamejaya said :-- \xc2\x93O Bhagavan! You spoke before in course of\nconversation that Satyavrata was cursed by Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha on the killing of his\ncow to become a Pis\xc2\x92acha; how then he got himself freed of this curse. There\nis a doubt on this point. Kindly clear it and oblige. Satyavrata was cursed;\nhence pronounced unfit to succeed to the throne. How was the Muni, by what\nactions, was he freed of the curse? How could the father bring back to his\nhome his son of the form of a Pis\xc2\x92acha? O Viprar _s_ i! Kindly narrate to me\nhow the Muni was freed of his curse.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n11-18. Vyasa said :-- Cursed by Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha, Satyavrata became then and\nthere transformed into a Pis\xc2\x92acha, very ugly, violent and terrible to all; but\nwhen he worshipped the Devi with devotion, immediately the Devi gave him a\nbeautiful divine body. By the grace of the Devi, his sins were all washed away\nand his Pis\xc2\x92acha form vanished. Satyavrata, then, freed from his sins became\nvery much vigorous and energetic. Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha also became pleased with him,\nblessed thus by the Supreme Force and so was his father, too. When his father\ndied, the virtuous Satyavrata became King, governed his subjects and performed\nvarious sacrifices and worshipped, too, the Eternal Mother of the Gods. O\nKing! Tris\xc2\x92anku had a very beautiful son born to him, named Haris\xc2\x92chandra,\nendowed in all his limbs with auspicious signs. The King Tris\xc2\x92anku wanted to\nmake his son Yuvaraja (the Crown prince) and then in his that very body while\nliving, enjoy the Heavens. The King went to the \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92rama of Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha and\ngladly asked him, with folded palms, bowing down before him duly.\n\n\n\n19-23. O Ascetic! You are the son of Brahma , versed in all the Vaidik\nMantrams; so you are exceedingly fortunate; now I beg to inform you one thing;\nhear it gladly. I now desire to enjoy the happiness of the Heavens and all the\nenjoyments of the Devas, while I am in this body. To enjoy in the Nandana\nGarden, to live with the Apsaras and to hear the sweet music of the Devas and\nthe Gandharbas, these ideas now have taken a strong hold of my heart.\nTherefore, O Great Muni! Engage me in such a sacrifice as will enable me, in\nthis very body to live in the Svarloka. O Muni! You are fully competent to do\nthis; therefore be ready for this. Have the sacrifice done and let me have\nquickly the Devaloka, so difficult to be obtained!\n\n\n\n24-26. Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha said :-- \xc2\x93O King! It is exceedingly hard to live in the\nHeavens while in this mortal body. The departed only live in the\n\n\n\np. 634\n\n\n\nHeavens by their merits, this is a known fact. Therefore, O Omniscient One!\nYour desire is hard to be attained. I am afraid of this. O King! The living\nmen can hardly enjoy the Apsaras. Therefore, O Blessed One! Do the sacrifice\nfirst. Then, when you leave this body, you will go to the Heavens.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n27-31. Vyasa said :-- O King! The Mahar _s_ i Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha was already angry\nwith the King; therefore when he spoke these words, the King heard and became\nabsent-minded. He again spoke to the Mahar _s_ i :-- O Brahma _n_ a! If you do\nnot allow me to do the sacrifice, on account of your haughtiness, I will have\nthe sacrifice performed now by another priest. Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha became very angry\nat the words of the King and cursed him :-- \xc2\x93O evilminded One! Be as soon as\npossible a Cha _nd_ ala in this body. You have committed acts by which your\npath to the Heaven is obstructed. You have stolen a Brahmi _n_ i\xc2\x92s wife, and\ndefiled the path of religion; you have killed the Surabhi Cow and you are a\nlibertine. Therefore, O Sinner! Never you will go to the Heavens, even after\nyour death.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n32-56. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing these harsh words from the Guru,\nTris\xc2\x92anku became immediately Cha _nd_ ala in that very body. His golden\nearrings became turned into iron; the sweet sandal smell over his body smelled\nlike faeces; his beautiful yellow clothings became blue, the colour of his\nbody became like that of an elephant, due to his curse. O King! Those who are\nthe worshippers of the Supreme Force can produce such things when they are\nangry; there is not the slightest doubt in this. Therefore one ought never to\ninsult any devotee of the Supreme Force. The Muni Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha is always\nengaged in repeating silently the Gayatri of the Devi. So what wonder is there\nthat the body of the King will be reduced to such a wretched state by his\nrage. The King Tris\xc2\x92anku became very sorry to see his ugly body; he did not go\nhome; rather he remained in the forest in that form and poor dress. He began\nto think, distressed with sorrow and over-powered with misery :-- \xc2\x93My body is\nnow blameable to the extreme, so what to do and where to go in this wretched\nstate! I find no remedy to exhaust all my sufferings. If I go home, my son\nwill be, no doubt, very much pained with sorrow. My wife, when she will see my\nCha _nd_ ala appearance, she won\xc2\x92t accept me; my ministers will not regard me\nas they used to do before. My friends and relations, when they will come to\nme, will not serve me with the former care. So it is far better to die than to\nlive, thus despised. I will drink poison or drown myself in waters or hang\nmyself. Or I will burn myself in the funeral pyre duly or I will quit this\nblameable life by starvation. But, Alas! I will be guilty of\n\n\n\np. 635\n\n\n\nsuicide; so again due to this sin I will be born a Cha _nd_ ala and I will be\nagain cursed.\xc2\x94 Thus thinking, the King again thought that at present he ought\nnot to commit suicide by any means. \xc2\x93I will have to suffer for my Karma; and,\nafter due suffering, this Karma will be exhausted. So I will suffer in this\nforest for my Karma in this my body. Without the enjoyment of the fruits, the\npast actions can never die out; therefore all actions done by me, auspicious\nor inauspicious, I will enjoy or suffer in this place. Always to remain close\nto a holy \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92rama, to wander in holy places of pilgrimage, to remember the\nDevi Ambika, and to serve the saints will now be my duties. Thus I will no\ndoubt exhaust all my actions, residing in this forest; then, if chance\npermits, and if I meet with a saintly person, all my intentions will be\ncrowned with success.\xc2\x94 Thus thinking, the King quitting his city went to the\nbanks of the Ganges and repenting very much, remained there on the Ganges. The\nKing Haris\xc2\x92chandra came to know the cause of his father\xc2\x92s curse and with a\nsorrowful heart sent ministers to him. Like a Cha _nd_ ala, the King was\nrespiring frequently; at this time the ministers went to him and bowing\nhumbly, said : -- O King! Your son has ordered us to come here; we have come\nat his command; we are the ministers of the King Haris\xc2\x92chandra. Know this\nverily, O King! Kindly hear what the Crown Prince has said :-- \xc2\x93Go and bring\nmy Father here without any delay.\xc2\x94 Therefore, O King! Cast aside your mental\nagonies and come to the city. The ministers, the subjects all will be always\nat your service. We will all try our best to please Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha, so that he\nmay favour you. And that greatly illustrious Muni being pleased will certainly\nremove your sorrows quickly. O King! Thus your son has spoken to us many\nwords; so now be pleased to go to your own abode.\n\n\n\n57-64. Vyasa said :-- O King! That Chandala-like King, hearing even their\nwords thus, did not consent to go back to his house. Rather he told them :--\n\xc2\x93Ministers, go back, all of you to the city; and at my word, tell my son that\nI won\xc2\x92t go back to my house. Better leaving off all idleness, you better\ngovern the Kingdom carefully. Shew your respect specially to the Brahmi _n_ s\nand perform various sacrifices and worship the Devas. I do not like in this\nblameable Cha _nd_ ala form to go to the city of Ayodhya with the high-souled\nones; so you all go back to Ayodhya without any further delay. Install, at my\norder, my powerful son Haris\xc2\x92chandra on the throne and do all these stately\nduties.\xc2\x94 When the ministers heard thus the King ordering them, they began to\ncry very much, and, bowing down, they went away early out of\n\n\n\np. 636\n\n\n\nthe hermitage. On coming back to Ayodhya they regularly installed on a sacred\nday the King Haris\xc2\x92chandra with Abhi _s_ eka water, purified with Mantrams.\nThus the powerful virtuous Haris\xc2\x92chandra, on being installed on the royal\nthrone by the command of the King, remembered always his father and began to\ngovern his Kingdom with his ministers according to the dictates of Dharma.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twelfth Chapter of the Seventh Book on the description of Vas\xc2\x92i\n_st_ ha\xc2\x92s curse on Tris\xc2\x92anku in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam\nof 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 13](bk07ch13.htm)\n\n'
