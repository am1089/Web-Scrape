He always enjoyed good fortune because\nthat he played with loaded dice. Duryodhana plotted with him, desiring greatly\nto subjugate the Pandavas, and Shakuni said: "Be advised by me. Yudhishthira\nloves the dice, although he knows not how to play. Ask him to throw dice with\nme, for there is no gambler who is my equal in the three worlds. I will put\nhim to shame. I will win from him his kingdom, O bull among men."\n\nDuryodhana was well pleased at this proposal, and he went before his blind\nfather, the maharajah, and prevailed upon him to invite the Pandavas to\nHastinapur for a friendly gambling match, despite the warnings of the royal\ncounsellors.\n\nSaid Dhritarashtra: "If the gods are merciful, my sons will cause no dispute.\nLet it be as fate hath ordained. No evil can happen so long as I am near,\n\np. 238\n\nand Bhishma and Drona are near also. Therefore, let the Pandavas be invited\nhither as my son desireth."\n\nSo Vidura, who feared trouble, was sent unto Indra-prastha to say: "The\nmaharajah is about to hold a great festival at Hastinapur, and he desires that\nYudhishthira and his brethren, their mother Pritha and their joint wife\nDraupadi, should be present. A great gambling match will be played."\n\nWhen Yudhishthira heard these words, he sorrowed greatly, for well he knew\nthat dice-throwing was ofttimes the cause of bitter strife. Besides, he was\nunwilling to play Prince Shakuni, that desperate and terrible gambler. . . .\nBut he could not refuse the invitation of Dhritarashtra, or, like a true\nKshatriya, disdain a challenge either to fight or to play with his peers.\n\nSo it came to pass that the Pandava brethren, with Pritha, their mother, and\ntheir joint wife Draupadi, journeyed to Hastinapur in all their splendour.\nDhritarashtra welcomed them in the presence of Bhishma and Drona and\nDuryodhana and Karna; then they were received by Queen Gandhari, and the wives\nof the Kaurava princes; and all the daughters-in-law of the blind maharajah\nbecame sad because that they were jealous of the beauty of Draupadi and the\nsplendour of her attire.\n\nThe Pandava lords and ladies went unto the dwelling which had been prepared\nfor them, and there they were visited in turn by the lords and ladies of\nHastinapur.\n\nOn the day that followed, Yudhishthira and his brethren went together to the\ngambling match, which was held in a gorgeous pavilion, roofed with arching\ncrystal and decorated with gold and lapis lazuli: it had a hundred doors and a\nthousand great columns, and it was richly carpeted. All the princes and great\nchieftains and warriors of the kingdom were gathered there. And\n\np. 239\n\n[paragraph continues] Prince Shakuni of Gandhari was there also with his false\ndice.\n\nWhen salutations had passed, and the great company were seated, Shakuni\ninvited Yudhishthira to play.\n\nSaid Yudhishthira: "I will play if mine opponent will promise to throw fairly,\nwithout trickery and deceit. Deceitful gambling is sinful, and unworthy a\nKshatriya; there is no prowess in it. Wise men do not applaud a player who\nwinneth by foul means."\n\nShakuni said: "A skilled gambler ever playeth with purpose to vanquish his\nopponent, as one warrior fighteth another less skilled than himself to\naccomplish his over-throw. Such is the practise in all contests; a man plays\nor fights to achieve victory. . . . But if thou art in dread of me, O\nYudhishthira, and afraid that thou wilt lose, \'twere better if thou didst not\nplay at all."\n\nSaid Yudhishthira: "Having been challenged, I cannot withdraw. I fear not to\nfight or to play with any man. . . . But first say who doth challenge and who\nis to lay stakes equally with me."\n\nThen Duryodhana spoke, saying: "O rajah, I will supply jewels and gold and any\nstakes thou wilt of as great value as thou canst set down. It is for me that\nShakuni, my uncle, is to throw the dice."\n\nSaid Yudhishthira: "This is indeed a strange challenge. One man is to throw\nthe dice and another is to lay the stakes. Such is contrary to all practice.\nIf, however, thou art determined to play in this fashion, let the game begin."\n\nWell did the Rajah of Indra-prastha know then that the match would not be\nplayed fairly. But he sat down, notwithstanding, to throw dice with Shakuni.\n\nAt the first throw Yudhishthira lost; indeed, he lost at every throw on that\nfatal day. He gambled away all\n\np. 240\n\nhis money and all his jewels, his jewelled chariot with golden bells, and all\nhis cattle; still he played on, and he lost his thousand war elephants, his\nslaves and beautiful slave girls, and the remainder of his goods; and next, he\nstaked and lost the whole kingdom of the Pandavas, save the lands which he had\ngifted to the Brahmans. Nor did he cease to play then, despite the advice\noffered him by the chieftains who were there. One by one he staked and lost\nhis brethren; and he staked himself and lost also.\n\nSaid Shakuni: "You have done ill, Yudhishthira, in staking thine own self; for\nnow thou hast become a slave; but if thou wilt stake Draupadi now and win, all\nthat thou hast lost will be restored unto thee."\n\nYudhishthira said: "So be it. I will stake Draupadi."\n\nAt these words the whole company was stricken with horror. Vidura swooned, and\nthe faces of Bhishma and Drona grew pallid; many groaned; but Duryodhana and\nhis brethren rejoiced openly before all men.\n\nShakuni threw the dice, and Yudhishthira lost this the last throw. In this\nmanner was Draupadi won by Duryodhana.\n\nThen all the onlookers gazed one upon another in silence and wide-eyed. Karna\nand Duhsasana 1 and other young princes laughed aloud.\n\nDuryodhana rose proudly and spake unto Vidura, saying: "Now hasten unto\nDraupadi and bid her to come hither to sweep the chambers with the other\nbonds-women."\n\nVidura was made angry, and answered him: "Thy words are wicked, O Duryodhana.\nThou canst not command a lady of royal birth to become a household slave.\nBesides, she is not thy slave, because Yudhishthira\n\np. 241\n\ndid stake his own freedom before he staked Draupadi. Thou couldst not win\naught from a slave who had no power to stake the princess."\n\nBut Duryodhana cursed Vidura, and bade one of his servants to bring Draupadi\nbefore him.\n\nSaid Vidura: "Duryodhana is this day deprived of his reason. Dishonesty is one\nof the doors to hell. By practising dishonesty Duryodhana will accomplish yet\nthe ruin of the Kauravas."\n\nThe beautiful Draupadi was sitting at peace within the fair dwelling set apart\nfor the Pandavas on the banks of the Ganges; its walls and towers were\nmirrored on the broad clear waters. Then suddenly, as a jackal enters\nstealthily the den of a lion, the menial sent by Duryodhana entered the palace\nand stood before high-horn Draupadi.\n\nSaid this man: "O queen, the mighty son of Pandu hath played and lost; he hath\nlost all, even his reason, and he hath staked thee, and thou hast been won by\nDuryodhana. And now Duryodhana bids me to say that thou art become his slave,\nand must obey him like to other female slaves. So come thou with me, for thou\nmust henceforth engage in menial work."\n\nDraupadi was astounded when he spake these words, and in her anguish she\ncried: "Have I heard thee aright? Hath my husband, the king, staked and lost\nme in his madness? Did he stake and loose aught beside?"\n\nSaid the man: "Yudhishthira hath lost all his riches and his kingdom; he\nstaked his brethren and lost them one by one; he staked himself and lost; and\nthen he staked thee, O queen, and lost also. Therefore, come thou with me."\n\nDraupadi rose in her pride and spoke angrily, saying: "If my lord did stake\nhimself and become a slave, he\n\np. 242\n\ncould not wager me, for a slave owns neither his own life nor the life of\nanother. Speak, therefore, unto my husband these words, and unto Duryodhana\nsay: \'Draupadi hath not been won\'."\n\nThe man returned to the assembly and spake unto Yudhishthira the words which\nDraupadi had said, but he bowed his head and was silent.\n\nDuryodhana was made angry by the defiant answer of the proud queen, and he\nsaid unto his brother Duhsasana: "The sons of Pandu are our slaves, and thy\nheart is without fear for them. Go thou to the palace and bid the princess, my\nhumble menial, to come hither quickly."\n\nRed-eyed and proud Duhsasana hastened to the palace. He entered the inner\nchambers and stood before Draupadi, who was clad in but a single robe, while\nher hair hung loosely.\n\nSaid the evil-hearted Kaurava: "O princess of Panchala with fair lotus eyes,\nthou hast been staked and lost fairly at the game of hazard. Hasten,\ntherefore, and stand before thy lord Duryodhana, for thou art now his bright-\neyed slave."\n\nDraupadi heard and trembled. She covered her eyes with her hands before the\nhated Duhsasana; her cheeks turned pale and her heart sickened. Then suddenly\nshe leapt up and sought to escape to an inner room. But the evil-hearted\nprince seized her by the hair, for he no longer feared the sons of Pandu, and\nthe beautiful princess quivered and shook in her loose attire like to a\nsapling which is shaken by the storm wind. Crouching on her knees, she cried\nangrily, while tears streamed from her lotus eyes: "Begone! O shameless\nprince. Can a modest woman appear before strangers in loose attire?"\n\nSaid stern and cruel Duhsasana: "Even if thou wert\n\n\n\n[![THE ORDEAL OF QUEEN DRAUPADI<br> From the painting by Warwick\nGoble](tn/24200.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/24200.jpg)  \nTHE ORDEAL OF QUEEN DRAUPADI  \nFrom the painting by Warwick Goble  \n\n\n\np. 243\n\nnaked now, thou must follow me. Hast thou not become a slave, fairly staked\nand fairly won? Henceforth thou wilt serve among the other menials."\n\nTrembling and faint, Draupadi was dragged through the streets by Duhsasana.\nWhen she stood before the elders and the chieftains in the pavilion she cried:\n"Forgive me because that I have come hither in this unseemly plight. . . ."\n\nBhishma and Drona and the other elders who were there hung their heads in\nshame.\n\nUnto Duhsasana Draupadi said angrily: "Cease thy wickedness! Defile me no\nlonger with unclean hands. A woman\'s hair is sacred."\n\nSacred indeed were the locks of the Pandava queen, for they had been sprinkled\nwith water sanctified by mantras at the imperial sacrifice.\n\nWeeping, she cried: "Hear and help me, O ye elders. You have wives and\nchildren of your own. Will you permit this wrong to be continued. Answer me\nnow."\n\nBut no man spake a word.\n\nDraupadi wept and said: "Why this silence? . . . Will no man among ye protect\na sinless woman? . . . Lost is the fame of the Kauravas, the ancient glory of\nBharata, and the prowess of the Kshatriyas! . . . Why will not the sons of\nPandu protect their outraged queen? . . . And hath Bhishma lost his virtue and\nDrona his power? . . . Will Yudhishthira no longer defend one who is wronged?\n. . . Why are ye all silent while this deed of shame is done before you?"\n\nAs she spake thus, Draupadi glanced round the sons of Pandu one by one, and\ntheir hearts thirsted for vengeance. Bhishma\'s face was dark, Drona clenched\nhis teeth, and Vidura, white and angry, gazed upon Duhsasana with amaze while\nhe tore off Draupadi\'s veil and addressed\n\np. 244\n\nher with foul words. When she looked towards the Kaurava brethren, Duhsasana\nsaid: "Ha! on whom darest thou to look now, O slave?"\n\nShakuni and Karna laughed to hear Draupadi called a slave, and they cried out:\n"Well spoken, well spoken!"\n\nDuhsasana endeavoured to strip the princess naked before the assembly; but\nDraupadi, in her distress, prayed aloud to Krishna, invoking him as the\ncreator of all and the soul of the universe, and entreated him to help her.\nKrishna heard her, and multiplied her garments so that Duhsasana was unable to\naccomplish his wicked purpose.\n\nKarna spake to Draupadi and said: "\'Tis not thy blame, O princess, that thou\nhast fallen so low. A woman\'s fate is controlled by her husband; Yudhishthira\nhath gambled thee away. Thou wert his, and must accept thy fate. Henceforward\nthou wilt be the slave of the Kaurava princes. Thou must obey them and please\nthem with thy beauty. . . . \'Tis meet that thou shouldst now seek for thyself\na husband who will love thee too well to stake thee at dice and suffer thee to\nbe put to shame. . . . Be assured that no one will blame a humble menial, as\nthou now art, who looks with eyes of love upon great and noble warriors.\nRemember that Yudhishthira is no longer thy husband; he hath become a slave,\nand a slave can have no wife. . . . Ah! sweet Princess of Panchala, those whom\nthou didst choose at thy swayamvara have gambled and lost thee; their kingdom\nthey have lost, and their power also."\n\nAt these words Bhima\'s bosom heaved with anger and with shame. Red-eyed he\nscowled upon Karna; he seemed to be the image of flaming Wrath. Unto\nYudhishthira he spake grimly, saying: "If you hadst not staked our freedom and\nour queen, O king and elder\n\np. 245\n\nbrother, this son of a charioteer would not have taunted us in this manner."\n\nYudhishthira bowed his head in shame, nor answered a word.\n\nArjuna reproved Bhima for his bitter words; but Pritha\'s mighty son, the\nslayer of Asuras, said: "If I am not permitted to punish the tormentor of\nDraupadi, bring me a fire that I may thrust my hands into it."\n\nA deep uproar rose from the assembly, and the elders applauded the wronged\nlady and censured Duhsasana. Bhima clenched his hands and, with quivering\nlips, cried out:\n\n"Hear my terrible words, O ye Kshatriyas. . . . May I never reach Heaven if I\ndo not yet seize Duhsasana in battle and, tearing open his breast, drink his\nvery life blood! . . ."\n\nAgain he spoke and said: "If Yudhishthira will permit me, I will slay the\nwretched sons of Dhritarashtra without weapons, even as a lion slays small\nanimals."\n\nThen Bhishma and Vidura and Drona cried out: "Forbear, O Bhima! Everything is\npossible in thee."\n\nDuryodhana gloried in his hour of triumph, and unto the elder of the Pandava\nbrethren spake tauntingly and said: "Yudhishthira, thou art spokesman for thy\nbrethren, and they owe thee obedience. Speak and say, thou who dost ever speak\ntruly, hast thou lost thy kingdom and thy brethren and thine own self? O\nYudhishthira, hast thou lost even the beauteous Draupadi? And hath she, thy\nwedded wife, become our humble menial?"\n\nYudhishthira heard him with downcast eyes, but his lips moved not. . . . Then\nKarna laughed; but Bhishma, pious and old, wept in silence.\n\nThen Duryodhana cast burning eyes upon Draupadi, and, baring his knee, invited\nher, as a slave, to sit upon it.\n\np. 246\n\nBhima gnashed his teeth, for he was unable to restrain his pent-up anger. With\neyes flashing like lightning, and in a voice like to thunder he cried out: a\nHear my vow! May I never reach Heaven or meet my ancestors hereafter if, for\nthese deeds of sin, I do not break the knee of Duryodhana in battle, and drink\nthe blood of Duhsasana!"\n\nThe flames of wrath which leapt on the forehead of Bhima were like red sparks\nflying from tough branches on a crackling fire.\n\nDhritarashtra was sitting in his palace, nor knew aught of what was passing.\nThe Brahmans, robed in white, were chanting peacefully their evening mantras,\nwhen a jackal howled in the sacrificial chamber. Asses brayed in response, and\nravens answered their cries from all sides. Those who heard these dread omens\nexclaimed: " _Swashti! Swashti!_ " 1\n\nDhritarashtra shook with terror, and when Vidura had told him all that had\ntaken place, he said: "The luckless and sinful Duryodhana hath brought shame\nupon the head of Rajah Drupada\'s sweet daughter, and thus courted death and\ndestruction. May the prayers of a sorrowful old man remove the wrath of Heaven\nwhich these dark omens have revealed."\n\nThen the blind maharajah was led to Draupadi, and before all the elders and\nthe princes he spoke to her, kindly and gently, and said: "Noble queen and\nvirtuous daughter, wife of pious Yudhishthira, and purest of all women, thou\nart very dear unto my heart. Alas! my sons have wronged thee in foul manner\nthis day. O forgive them now, and let the wrath of Heaven be averted.\nWhatsoever thou wilt ask of me will be thine."\n\nSaid Draupadi: "O mighty maharajah, thou art merciful; may happiness be thy\ndower. I ask of thee to set at\n\np. 247\n\nliberty now my lord and husband Yudhishthira. Having been a prince, it is not\nseemly that he should be called a slave."\n\nDhritarashtra said: "Thy wish is granted. Ask a second boon and blessing, O\nfair one. Thou dost deserve more than a single boon."\n\nSaid Draupadi: "Let Arjuna and Bhima and their younger brethren be set free\nalso and allowed to depart now with their horses and their chariots and their\nweapons."\n\nDhritarashtra said: "So be it, O high-born princess.\n\nAsk yet another boon and blessing and it will be granted thee."\n\nSaid Draupadi: "I seek no other boon, thou generous monarch: I am a Kshatriya\nby birth, and not like to a Brahman, who craveth for gifts without end. Thou\nhast freed my husbands from slavery: they will regain their fortunes by their\nown mighty deeds."\n\nThen the Pandava brethren departed from Hastinapur with Pritha and Draupadi,\nand returned unto the city of Indra-prastha.\n\nThe Kauravas were made angry, and Duryodhana remonstrated with his royal sire\nand said: "Thou hast permitted the Pandava princes to depart in their anger;\nnow they will make ready to wage war against us to regain their kingdom and\ntheir wealth; when they return they will slay us all. Permit us, therefore, to\nthrow dice with them once again. We will stake our liberty, and be it laid\ndown that the side which loseth shall go into exile for twelve full years, and\ninto concealment for a year thereafter. By this arrangement a bloody war may\nbe averted."\n\nDhritarashtra granted his son\'s wish and recalled the Pandavas. So it came to\npass that Yudhishthira sat down\n\np. 248\n\nonce again to play with Shakuni, and once again Shakuni brought forth the\nloaded dice. Ere long the game ended, and Yudhishthira had lost.\n\nDuhsasana danced with joy and cried aloud: "Now is established the empire of\nDuryodhana."\n\nSaid Bhima: "Be not too gladsome, O Duhsasana. Hear and remember my words: May\nI never reach Heaven or meet my sires until I shall drink thy blood!"\n\nThen the Pandava princes cast off their royal garments and clad themselves in\ndeerskins like humble mendicants. Yudhishthira bade farewell to Dhritarashtra\nand Bhishma and Kripa and Vidura, one by one, and he even said farewell to the\nKaurava brethren.\n\nSaid Vidura: "Thy mother, the royal Pritha, is too old to wander with thee\nthrough forest and jungle. Let her dwell here until the years of your exile\nhave passed away.\n\nYudhishthira spoke for his brethren and said: "Be it so, O saintly Vidura. Now\nbless us ere we depart, for thou hast been unto us like to a father."\n\nThen Vidura blessed each one of the Pandava princes, saying: "Be saintly in\nexile, subdue your passions, learn truth in your sorrow, and return in\nhappiness. May these eyes be blessed by beholding thee in Hastinapur once\nagain."\n\nPritha wept over Draupadi and blessed her. Then the Princess of Panchala went\nforth with loose tresses; but ere she departed from the city she vowed a vow,\nsaying: "From this day my hair will fall over my forehead until Bhima shall\nhave slain Duhsasana and drunk his blood; then shall Bhima tie up my tresses\nwhile his hands are yet wet with the blood of Duhsasana."\n\nThe Pandava princes wandered towards the deep forest, and Draupadi followed\nthem.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[237:1](iml20.htm#fr_260) Candahar.\n\n[240:1](iml20.htm#fr_261) _Pron_. doo-sas\xc2\xb4a-na.\n\n[246:1](iml20.htm#fr_262) similar to "Amen".\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XVI.
