Frustration of the sacrifice of an enemy.\n\n1\\. Whenever yonder person in his thought, and with his speech, offers\nsacrifice accompanied by oblations and benedictions, may Nirriti (the goddess\nof destruction), allying herself with death, smite his offering before it\ntakes effect!  \n2\\. May sorcerers, Nirriti, as well as Rakshas, mar his true work with error!\nMay the gods, despatched by Indra, scatter (churn) his sacrificial butter; may\nthat which yonder person offers not succeed!  \n3\\. The two agile supreme rulers, like two eagle-s pouiicing down, shall\nstrike the sacrificial butter pf the enemy, whosoever plans evil against us!  \n4\\. Back do I tie both thy two arms, thy mouth I shut. With the fury of god\nAgni, have I destroyed thy oblation.  \n5\\. I tie thy two arms, I shut thy mouth. With the fury of terrible Agni have\nI destroyed thy oblation.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 7. Charm against curses and hostile plots, undertaken with a\ncertain plant](av097.htm)\n\n'
