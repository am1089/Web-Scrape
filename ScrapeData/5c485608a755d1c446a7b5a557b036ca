 \nOn flesh of slaughtered saints I fed.  \nThen Vis\'vamitra, sage revered.  \nHoly of heart, my fury feared.  \nTo Das\'aratha\'s court he sped  \nAnd went before the king and said: 2b  \n\n\'With me, my lord, thy Rama send  \nOn holy days his aid to lend.  \nMaricha fills my soul with dread  \nAnd keeps me sore disquieted.\'  \n\nThe monarch heard the saint\'s request  \nAnd thus the glorious sage addressed:  \n\n\'My boy as yet in arms untrained  \nThe age of twelve has scarce attained.  \nBut I myself a host will lead  \nTo guard thee in the hour of need.  \nMy host with fourfold troops complete,  \nThe rover of the night shall meet,  \nAnd I, O best of saints, will kill  \nThy foeman and thy prayer fulfil.\'  \nThe king vouchsafed his willing aid:  \nThe saint again this answer made:  \n\n\'By Rama\'s might, and his alone,  \nCan this great fiend be overthrown.  \nI know in days of yore the Blest  \nThy saving help in fight confessed.  \nStill of thy famous deeds they tell  \nIn heaven above, in earth, and hell,  \nA mighty host obeys thy hest:  \nHere let it still, I pray thee, rest.  \nThy glorious son, though yet a boy,  \nWill in the fight that fiend destroy.  \nRama alone with me shall go:  \nBe happv, victor of the foe.\'  \n\nHe spoke: the monarch gave assent,  \nAnd Rama to the hermit lent.  \nSo to his woodland home in joy  \nWent Vis\'vamitra with the boy.  \nWith ready bow the champion stood  \nTo guard the rites in Dandak wood.  \nWith glorious eyes, most bright to view,  \nBeardless as yet and dark of hue;  \nA single robe his only wear,  \nHis temples veiled with waving hair,  \n\np. 274  \n\nAround his neck a chain of gold,  \nHe grasped the bow he loved to bold;  \nAnd the young hero\'s presence made  \nA glory in the forest shade.  \nThus Rama with his beauteous mien,  \nLike the young rising moon was seen,  \nI, like a cloud which tempest brings,  \nMy arms adorned with golden rings,  \nProud of the boon which lent me might,  \nApproached where dwelt the anchorite.  \nBut Rama saw me venturing nigh,  \nRaising my murderous axe on high;  \nHe saw, and fearless of the foe,  \nStrung with calm hand his trusty bow  \nBy pride of conscious strength beguiled,  \nI scorned him as a feeble child,  \nAnd rushed with an impetuous bound  \nOn Vis\'vamitra\'s holy ground.  \nA keen swift shaft he pointed well,  \nThe foeman\'s rage to check and quell,  \nAnd hurled a hundred leagues away  \nDeep in the ocean waves I lay.  \nHe would not kill, but, nobly brave,  \nMy forfeit life he chose to save.  \nSo there I lay with wandering sense  \nDazed by that arrow\'s violence.  \nLong in the sea I lay: at length  \nSlowly returned my sense and strength,  \nAnd rising from my watery bed  \nTo Lanka\'s town again I sped.  \nThus was I spared, but all my band  \nFell slain by Rama\'s conquering hand,--  \nA boy, untrained in warrior skill,  \nOf iron arm and dauntless will.  \nIf thou with Rama still, in spite  \nOf warning and of prayer, wilt fight,  \nI see terrific woes impend,  \nAnd dire defeat thy days will end.  \nThy giants all will feel the blow  \nAnd share the fatal overthrow,  \nWho love the taste of joy and play,  \nThe banquet and the festal day.  \nThine eyes will see destruction take  \nThy Lanka, lost for Sita\'s sake,  \nAnd stately pile and palace fall  \nWith terrace, dome, and jewelled wall.  \nThe good will die: the crime of kings  \nDestruction on the people brings:  \nThe sinless die, as in the lake  \nThe fish must perish with the snake.  \nThe prostrate giants thou wilt see  \nSlain for this folly wrought by thee,  \nTheir bodies bright with precious scent  \nAnd sheen of heavenly ornament;  \nOr so the remnant of thy train  \nSeek refuge far, when help is vain  \nAnd with their wives, or widowed, fly  \nTo every quarter of the sky;  \nThy mournful eyes, where\'er they turn,  \nWill see thy stately city burn,  \nWhen royal homes with fire are red,  \n\nAnd arrowy nets around are spread.  \nA sin that tops all sins in shame  \nIs outrage to another\'s dame,  \nA thousand wives thy palace fill,  \nAnd countless beauties wait thy will.  \nO rest contented with thine own,  \nNor let thy race be overthrown.  \nIf thou, O King, hast still delight  \nIn rank and wealth and power and might,  \nIn noble wives, in troops of friends,  \nIn all that royal state attends,  \nI warn thee, cast not all away,  \nNor challenge Rama to the fray.  \nIf deaf to every friendly prayer,  \n   Thou still wilt seek the strife,  \nAnd from the side of Rama tear  \n   His lovely Maithil wife,  \nSoon will thy life and empire end  \n   Destroyed by Rama\'s bow,  \nAnd thou, with kith and kin and friend,  \nTo Yama\'a realm must go.\'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[273:1b](ry236.htm#fr_492) Serpent-gods.\n\n[273:2b](ry236.htm#fr_493) See p. 33.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXXIX.: Maricha\'s Speech.](ry237.htm)\n\n'
