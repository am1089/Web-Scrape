Of (three parts of) it the wooden sword (sphya) represents\none-third or thereabouts, the sacrificial post one-third or thereabouts, and\nthe chariot one-third or thereabouts. That piece, moreover, with which he\nstruck him, was broken off ( _s_ _ri_ ); and on falling down it became an\narrow ( _s_ ara): hence the designation arrow, because it was broken off. And\nin this way the thunderbolt became fourfold.\n\n1:2:4:22\\. In consequence of this, the priests make use of two (of these\npieces) at the sacrifice, and men of the military caste (ra _g_ anyabandhu)\nalso make use of two of them in battle: viz. the priests make use of the\nsacrificial post and the wooden sword, and the men of the military caste of\nthe chariot and the arrow.\n\n1:2:4:33\\. Now when he takes up the wooden sword 2, he raises that thunderbolt\nagainst the wicked, spiteful enemy, even as Indra at that time raised the\nthunderbolt against V _ri_ tra: that is the reason why he takes the wooden\nsword.\n\n1:2:4:44\\. He takes it, with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 24): 'At the impulse of\nthe divine Savit _ri_ , I take thee with\n\np. 53\n\nthe arms of the A _s_ vins, with the hands of Pushan; thee that performs\nsacred rites to the gods!' Savit _ri_ , namely, is the impeller of the gods:\nthus he thereby takes that (wooden sword) as one impelled by Savit _ri_. 'With\nthe arms of the A _s_ vins,' he says, because the A _s_ vins are the two\nAdhvaryu priests (of the gods): with their arms he therefore takes it, not\nwith his own. Pushan is distributer of portions (to the gods): with his hands\nhe therefore takes it, not with his own; for it is the thunderbolt, and no man\ncan hold that: he thus takes it with (the assistance of) the gods.\n\n1:2:4:55\\. 'I take (thee) that performs sacred rites to the gods,' he says,\nbecause a sacred rite means a sacrifice: 'that performs sacrifices to the\ngods,' he thereby says. After taking it in his left hand and touching it with\nhis right, he murmurs--by what he murmurs he makes it sharp,--\n\n1:2:4:66\\. He murmurs (Va _g_. S. I, 24): 'Thou art Indra's right arm!' for\nIndra's right arm no doubt is the most powerful one, and for that reason he\nsays: 'Thou art Indra's right arm!' 'The thousand-spiked, hundred-edged! he\nadds, for a thousand spikes and a hundred edges had that thunderbolt which he\nhurled at V _ri_ tra: he thereby makes it to be that (thunderbolt).\n\n1:2:4:77\\. 'The sharp-edged Vayu (wind) art thou!' he adds; for that indeed is\nthe sharpest edge, to wit, that (wind) which here blows: for that one sweeps\nright across these worlds. He thereby makes it sharp. When he (further) says:\n'The killer of the enemy!' let him, whether he wishes to exorcise or not, say:\n'The killer of so and so!' When it has been sharpened, he must not touch\neither himself or the earth with it: 'Lest I should hurt either myself or the\nearth with that sharp thunderbolt,' thus he thinks, and for\n\np. 54\n\nthat reason he does not touch either himself or the earth with it.\n\n1:2:4:88\\. The gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra _g_ apati\n1,were contending for superiority. The gods vanquished the Asuras; and yet\nthese afterwards harassed them again.\n\n1:2:4:99\\. The gods then said: 'We do, no doubt, vanquish the Asuras, but\nnevertheless they afterwards again harass us. How then can we vanquish them so\nthat we need not fight them again?'\n\n1:2:4:1010\\. Agni then said: 'By fleeing northwards they escape from us.' By\nfleeing northwards they had indeed escaped from them.\n\n1:2:4:1111\\. Agni said: 'I will go round to the northern side, and you will\nthen shut them in from here 2; and whilst shutting them in, we will put them\ndown by these (three) worlds; and from what fourth world there is beyond these\n(three) they will not be able to rise again.'\n\n1:2:4:1212\\. Agni thereupon went round to the northern side; and they (the\nother gods) shut them in from here; and whilst shutting them in, they put them\ndown with these(three)worlds; and from what fourth world\n\np. 55\n\nthere is beyond these (three) they did not rise again. Now this same\n(expulsion of the Asuras) is virtually the same act as the flinging away of\nthe grass-bush 1.\n\n1:2:4:1313\\. The \xc3\x82gnidhra goes round to the north, for he is virtually the\nsame person as Agni himself. The Adhvaryu then shuts them in from here,; and\nwhilst shutting them in, he puts them down by means of these (three) worlds;\nand from what fourth world there is beyond these (three) they do not rise\nagain. Thus now also they do not rise again, for by the same means by which\nthe gods kept them off, the priests now also keep them off during the\nsacrifice.\n\n1:2:4:1414\\. And whoever has evil designs upon the sacrificer and hates him,\nhim he thereby puts down by means of these (three) worlds, and what fourth\nworld there is beyond these. And in putting him down with these (three)\nworlds, and what fourth world there is beyond these, he flings everything away\nfrom this (earth), for on it all these worlds rest: for what would he fling\naway, if he were to fling (the grass-bush) away with the words, 'The air I\nthrow away, the heaven I throw away!' therefore he flings everything away from\nthis (earth) 2.\n\n1:2:4:1515\\. Thereupon, after putting the grass-bush between 3, he flings (the\nwooden sword at it). 'Lest I\n\np. 56\n\nshould injure the earth with this sharp thunderbolt!' thus (he thinks, and)\nfor that reason he flings after putting the grass-bush between.\n\n1:2:4:1616\\. He flings it, with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 25): 'O earth, that\naffordest the place for making offerings to the gods! may I not injure the\nroot of thy plant!' He thereby makes her, as it were, with roots remaining in\nher 1. Whilst he takes up (the earth dug up by the sword), he thus addresses\nher: 'May I not injure the roots of thy plants!'--And in further saying, 'Go\nto the fold, the abode of the cows!' when he is about to throw it away (on the\nheap of rubbish), he causes it not to forsake him; for that which is within\nthe fold 2 does not forsake him: for that reason he says, 'Go to the fold, the\nabode of the cows!' He further says (whilst looking at the hole in the\nground): 'May the sky rain on thee!' Wherever, in digging into her, they wound\nand injure her--water being (a means of) expiation--that he thereby expiates\nby the water which is (a means of) expiation; that he thereby makes good by\nmeans of the water: that is the reason why he says: 'May the sky rain on\nthee!'--'Tie him down, O divine Savit _ri_ , to the furthest end of the\nearth!' he says (whilst throwing on the heap of rubbish the soil dug up); he\nthus\n\np. 57\n\nsays to the divine Savit _ri_ : 'Tie him down to blind darkness!' when he says\n'to the furthest end of the earth,'--'With a hundred fetters!' by this he\nmeans to say, 'so that he cannot free himself.'--'Him who hates us and whom we\nhate, do not release from there!' Whether or not he wishes to exorcise, let\nhim say: 'So and so . . . do not release from there!'\n\n1:2:4:1717\\. He then throws (the wooden sword) a second time, with the text\n(Va _g_. S. I, 26): 'May I drive Araru away from the earth, the place of\nofferings!' Araru 1, namely, was an Asura and Rakshas. Him the gods drove away\nfrom this (earth), and in the same way he (the Adhvaryu) thereby drives him\naway from this (earth). He adds (whilst repeating the several corresponding\nacts): 'Go to the fold, the abode of the cows! May the sky rain on thee! Tie\nhim down, O divine Savit _ri_ , to the furthest end of the earth, with a\nhundred fetters, him who hates us and whom we hate, do not release him from\nthere!'\n\n1:2:4:1818\\. The \xc3\x82gnidhra presses it down (on the heap of rubbish), with the\ntext (Va _g_. S. I, 26): 'O Araru! thou shalt not fly up to heaven!' For when\nthe gods drove away Araru, the Asura-Rakshas, he wished to fly up to heaven.\nAgni pressed him down, saying, 'O Araru, thou shalt not fly up to heaven!' and\nhe did not fly up to heaven. In the same way the\n\np. 58\n\n[paragraph continues] Adhvaryu thereby cuts him off from this world, and the\n\xc3\x82gnidhra from the side of heaven. That is the reason why he does this.\n\n1:2:4:1919\\. He then throws (the wooden sword) a third time, with the text (Va\n_g_. S. I, 26): 'Let thy drop not spring up to the sky!' Her (the earth's)\ndrop no doubt is that moisture of hers upon which the creatures subsist. 'Let\nthis thine (moisture) not fly away to the sky!' he thereby says.--He adds\n(whilst again repeating the several acts): 'Go to the fold, the abode of the\ncows! May the sky rain on thee! Tie him down, O divine Savit _ri_ , to the\nfurthest end of the earth, with a hundred fetters, him who hates us and whom\nwe hate, do not release him from there!'\n\n1:2:4:2020\\. Three times he throws it, with the sacrificial formula (Ya _g_\nus); for three are these worlds, and with these worlds he thereby puts him\n(the evil spirit) down 1. And what these worlds are, that in truth is the Ya\n_g_ us: for that reason he throws it thrice with the sacrificial formula.\n\n1:2:4:2121\\. Silently (he throws) a fourth time 2. What fourth world there may\nor may not be beyond these (three), by that one he thereby drives away the\nspiteful enemy. For uncertain indeed is what fourth world there may or may not\nbe beyond these (three); and uncertain also is what (is done) silently: for\nthat reason (he throws) silently a fourth time.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[52:1](sbe1209.htm#fr_180) A fabulous kind of deer with eight legs, which was\nsupposed to kill elephants and lions.\n\n[52:2](sbe1210.htm#fr_181) See note on I, 1, 2, 8.\n\n[54:1](sbe1210.htm#fr_182) Pra _g_ apati is called the father of the gods and\nAsuras, I, 5, 3, 2; and they are represented as entering on his inheritance,\nI, 7, 2, 22; IX, 5, 1, 12. Not only the gods and Asuras, but also the men\nderive their origin from Pra _g_ apati, XIV, 8, 2, 1. He has created all\nbeings, I, 6, 3, 35; Ait. Br. III, 36.\n\n[54:2](sbe1210.htm#fr_183) I.e. 'from the sacrificial ground,' Saya _n_ a. It\nseems doubtful to me whether it does not rather mean 'you will then shut them\nin, or block them up, within that place,' that is to say, north of the altar,\nwhere the utkara, or heap of rubbish, lies. The four worlds by which he puts\ndown the enemies are represented by the loose soil which is dug up by the\nsphya being flung four separate times at the grass-bush lying on the altar\n(vedi), and which is then thrown on the utkara.\n\n[55:1](sbe1210.htm#fr_184) The ceremony called stambaya _g_ us (-hara _n_ am)\nconsists in 'the throwing away of the grass-bush after cutting it by the\n(flinging of the) wooden sword, with the simultaneous reciting of Ya _g_ us-\ntexts' [ya _g_ urmantrako darbha _h_ stambaya _g_ u _h_ , ta _k_ _k_ a\nstambarupa _m_ sphyena bhittvotkarade _s_ e haret, Say., Taitt. S. I, 1, 9].\n\n[55:2](sbe1210.htm#fr_185) This passage, in which the author seems to argue\nagainst some other ritualistic authority, is not quite clear to me. The Taitt.\nBr. has, 'from the atmosphere he drives him away (by the second throw), from\nthe sky he drives him away (by the third throw).'\n\n[55:3](sbe1210.htm#fr_186) That is, between himself, or the wooden sword, and\nthe altar. According to Katy. II, 6, 15, he lays the grass-bush down on the p.\n56 altar with its top pointing northwards, with the text: 'The armour of the\nearth art thou!'\n\n[56:1](sbe1210.htm#fr_187) Saya _n_ a explains it by uttaramulam iva karoti;\n'p _ri_ thivim uparibhagavasthitamulayuktam iva' (? 'with the roots remaining\nin its (the earth's) upper part, or surface'). Cf. also Say. on Taitt. S. I,\n1, 9 (p. 155).\n\n[56:2](sbe1210.htm#fr_188) The Taitt. Br. (III, 2, 9, 3) identifies the fold\n(pen, stable) with the metres (? which enclose the altar in the shape of the\nfirst set of lines), cf. _S_ at. Br. I, 2, 5, 6 seq. This identification rests\non the double meaning of go (in gosthanam) as 'cow' and 'metre.'\n\n[57:1](sbe1210.htm#fr_189) Of this demon we have no further particulars except\nthat in Rig-veda X, 99, 10, he is said to have four feet; see also Taitt. Br.\nIII, 2, 9, 4 seq. Perhaps there is some connection between Araru and the\nArurmaghas in Ait. Br. VII, 28, and the Arunmukhas in Kaushit. Up. 3, 1; both\nof them enemies of Indra. Cf. M. Haug's and Max Muller's translations of these\nworks; and Weber, Ind. Stud. I, 411.\n\n[58:1](sbe1210.htm#fr_190) In the corresponding passage of the Black Ya _g_ us\n(Taitt. Br. III, 2, 9, 5 seq.) the Adhvaryu is represented as driving the\nenemy away from the four worlds by throwing the sword four times.\n\n[58:2](sbe1210.htm#fr_191) When, together with the dug-out soil, he throws the\ngrass-bush on the heap of rubbish. Katy. II, 6, 24.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2. 5. Fifth Brahma _n_ a](sbe1211.htm)\n\n"
