The small (ether) (is Brahman) on account of the subsequent (arguments).\n\nWe read ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 1, 1),' There is this city of Brahman, and in it the\npalace, the small lotus, and in it that small ether. Now what exists within\nthat small ether that is to be sought for, that is to be understood,' &c.--\nHere the doubt arises whether the small ether within the small lotus of the\nheart of which Scripture speaks, is the elemental ether, or the individual\nsoul (vi _g \xc3\xb1_anatman), or the highest Self. This doubt is caused by the words\n'ether' and 'city of Brahman.' For the word 'ether,' in the first place, is\nknown to be used in the sense of elemental ether as well as of highest\nBrahman. Hence the doubt whether the small ether of the text be the elemental\nether or the highest ether, i. e. Brahman. In explanation of the expression\n'city of Brahman,' in the second place, it might be said either that the\nindividual soul is here called Brahman and the body Brahman's city, or else\nthat the city of Brahman means the city of the highest Brahman. Here (i.e. in\nconsequence of this latter doubt) a further doubt arises as to\n\np. 175\n\nthe nature of the small ether, according as the individual soul or the highest\nSelf is understood by the Lord of the city.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that by the small ether we have to understand the\nelemental ether, since the latter meaning is the conventional one of the word\naka _s_ a. The elemental ether is here called small with reference to its\nsmall abode (the heart).--In the passage, 'As large as this ether is, so large\nis that ether within the heart,' it is represented as constituting at the same\ntime the two terms of a comparison, because it is possible to make a\ndistinction between the outer and the inner ether  1; and it is said that\n'heaven and earth are contained within it,' because the whole ether, in so far\nas it is space, is one  2.--Or else, the purvapakshin continues, the 'small\none' may be taken to mean the individual soul, on account of the term, 'the\ncity of Brahman.' The body is here called the city of Brahman because it is\nthe abode of the individual soul; for it is acquired by means of the actions\nof the soul. On this interpretation we must assume that the individual soul is\nhere called Brahman metaphorically. The highest Brahman cannot be meant,\nbecause it is not connected with the body as its lord. The lord of the city,\ni.e. the soul, is represented as dwelling in one spot of the city (viz. the\nheart), just as a real king resides in one spot of his residence. Moreover,\nthe mind (manas) constitutes the limiting adjunct of the individual soul, and\nthe mind chiefly abides in the heart; hence the individual soul only can be\nspoken of as dwelling in the heart. Further, the individual soul only can be\nspoken of as small, since it is (elsewhere; _S_ vet. Up. V, 8) compared in\nsize to the point of a goad. That it is compared (in the passage under\ndiscussion) to the ether must be understood to intimate its non difference\nfrom Brahman.--\n\np. 176\n\n[paragraph continues] Nor does the scriptural passage say that the 'small' one\nis to be sought for and to be understood, since in the clause, 'That which is\nwithin that,' &c., it is represented as a mere distinguishing attribute of\nsomething else 1.\n\nTo all this we make the following reply:--The small ether can mean the highest\nLord only, not either the elemental ether or the individual soul.--Why?--On\naccount of the subsequent reasons, i. e. on account of the reasons implied in\nthe complementary passage. For there, the text declares at first, with\nreference to the small ether, which is enjoined as the object of sight, 'If\nthey should say to him,' &c.; thereupon follows an objection, 'What is there\nthat deserves to be sought for or that is to be understood?' and thereon a\nfinal decisive statement, 'Then he should say: As large as this ether is, so\nlarge is that ether within the heart. Both heaven and earth are contained\nwithin it.' Here the teacher, availing himself of the comparison of the ether\nwithin the heart with the known (universal) ether, precludes the conception\nthat the ether within the heart is small--which conception is based on the\nstatement as to the smallness of the lotus, i. e. the heart--and thereby\nprecludes the possibility of our understanding by the term 'the small ether,'\nthe elemental ether. For, although the ordinary use of language gives to the\nword 'ether' the sense of elemental ether, here the elemental ether cannot be\nthought of, because it cannot possibly be compared with itself.--But, has it\nnot been stated above, that the ether, although one only, may be compared with\nitself, in consequence of an assumed difference between the outer and the\ninner ether?--That explanation, we reply, is impossible; for we cannot admit\nthat a comparison of a thing with itself may be based upon a merely imaginary\ndifference. And even if we admitted\n\np. 177\n\nthe possibility of such a comparison, the extent of the outer ether could\nnever be ascribed to the limited inner ether. Should it be said that to the\nhighest Lord also the extent of the (outer) ether cannot be ascribed, since\nanother scriptural passage declares that he is greater than ether ( _S_ a.\nBra, X, 6, 3, 2), we invalidate this objection by the remark, that the passage\n(comparing the inner ether with the outer ether) has the purport of discarding\nthe idea of smallness (of the inner ether), which is prima facie established\nby the smallness of the lotus of the heart in which it is contained, and has\nnot the purport of establishing a certain extent (of the inner ether). If the\npassage aimed at both, a split of the sentence  1 would result.--Nor, if we\nallowed the assumptive difference of the inner and the outer ether, would it\nbe possible to represent that limited portion of the ether which is enclosed\nin the lotus of the heart, as containing within itself heaven, earth, and so\non. Nor can we reconcile with the nature of the elemental ether the qualities\nof Self-hood, freeness from sin, and so on, (which are ascribed to the 'small'\nether) in the following passage, 'It is the Self free from sin, free from old\nage, from death and grief, from hunger and thirst, of true desires, of true\npurposes.'--Although the term 'Self' (occurring in the passage quoted) may\napply to the individual soul, yet other reasons exclude all idea of the\nindividual soul being meant (by the small ether). For it would be impossible\nto dissociate from the individual soul, which is restricted by limiting\nconditions and elsewhere compared to the point of a goad, the attribute of\nsmallness attaching to it, on account of its being enclosed in the lotus of\nthe heart.--Let it then be assumed--our opponent remarks--that the qualities\nof all-pervadingness, &c. are ascribed to the individual soul with the\nintention of intimating its non-difference from Brahman.--Well, we reply, if\nyou suppose that the small ether is called all-pervading because it is one\nwith Brahman, our own supposition,\n\np. 178\n\nviz. that the all-pervadingness spoken of is directly predicated of Brahman\nitself, is the much more simple one.--Concerning the assertion that the term\n'city of Brahman' can only be understood, on the assumption that the\nindividual soul dwells, like a king, in one particular spot of the city of\nwhich it is the Lord, we remark that the term is more properly interpreted to\nmean 'the body in so far as it is the city of the highest Brahman;' which\ninterpretation enables us to take the term 'Brahman' in its primary sense 1.\nThe highest Brahman also is connected with the body, for the latter\nconstitutes an abode for the perception of Brahman 2. Other scriptural\npassages also express the same meaning, so, for instance, Pra. Up. V, 5, 'He\nsees the highest person dwelling in the city' (purusha = puri _s_ aya), &c.,\nand B _ri_. Up. II, 5, 18, 'This person (purusha) is in all cities (bodies)\nthe dweller within the city (puri _s_ aya).'--Or else (taking brahmapura to\nmean _g_ ivapura) we may understand the passage to teach that Brahman is, in\nthe city of the individual soul, near (to the devout worshipper), just as Vish\n_n_ u is near to us in the _S_ alagrama-stone.--Moreover, the text (VIII, 1,\n6) at first declares the result of works to be perishable ('as here on earth\nwhatever has been acquired by works perishes, so perishes whatever is acquired\nfor the next world by good actions,' &c.), and afterwards declares the\nimperishableness of the results flowing from a knowledge of the small ether,\nwhich forms the general subject of discussion ('those who depart from hence\nafter having discovered the Self and those true desires, for them there is\nfreedom in all worlds'). From this again it is manifest that the small ether\nis the highest Self.--We now turn to the statement made by the purvapakshin,\n'that the sacred text does not represent the small ether as that\n\np. 179\n\nwhich is to be sought for and to be understood, because it is mentioned as a\ndistinguishing attribute of something else,' and reply as follows: If the\n(small) ether were not that which is to be sought for and to be understood,\nthe description of the nature of that ether, which is given in the passage\n('as large as this ether is, so large is that ether within the heart'), would\nbe devoid of purport.--But--the opponent might say--that descriptive statement\nalso has the purport of setting forth the nature of the thing abiding within\n(the ether); for the text after having raised an objection (in the passage,\n'And if they should say to him: Now with regard to that city of Brahman and\nthe palace in it, i.e. the small lotus of the heart, and the small ether\nwithin the heart, what is there within it that deserves to be sought for or\nthat is to be understood?') declares, when replying to that objection, that\nheaven, earth, and so on, are contained within it (the ether), a declaration\nto which the comparison with the ether forms a mere introduction.--Your\nreasoning, we reply, is faulty. If it were admitted, it would follow that\nheaven, earth, &c., which are contained within the small ether, constitute the\nobjects of search and enquiry. But in that case the complementary passage\nwould be out of place. For the text carrying on, as the subject of discussion,\nthe ether that is the abode of heaven, earth, &c.--by means of the clauses,\n'In it all desires are contained,' 'It is the Self free from sin,' &c., and\nthe passage, 'But those who depart from hence having discovered the Self, and\nthe true desires' (in which passage the conjunction 'and' has the purpose of\njoining the desires to the Self)--declares that the Self as well, which is the\nabode of the desires, as the desires which abide in the Self, are the objects\nof knowledge. From this we conclude that in the beginning of the passage also,\nthe small ether abiding within the lotus of the heart, together with whatever\nis contained within it as earth, true desires, and so on, is represented as\nthe object of knowledge. And, for the reasons explained, that ether is the\nhighest Lord.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[175:1](sbe34083.htm#fr_183) So that the interpretation of the purvapakshin\ncannot be objected to on the ground of its involving the comparison of a thing\nto itself.\n\n[175:2](sbe34083.htm#fr_184) So that no objection can be raised on the ground\nthat heaven and earth cannot be contained in the small ether of the heart.\n\n[176:1](sbe34083.htm#fr_185) Viz. of that which is within it. \xc3\x82nanda Giri\nproposes two explanations: na _k_ eti, paravi _s_ esha _n_ atvenety atra paro\ndaharaka _s_ a upadanat tasminn iti saptamyanta-ta _kkh_ abdasyeti _s_ esha\n_h_.
