And because the qualities meant to be stated are possible (in Brahman).\n\nThe qualities about to be stated can belong to the highest Self only. \'Made of\nmind, having breath for its body,\' &c. \'Made of mind\' means to be apprehended\nby a purified mind only. The highest Self can be apprehended only by a mind\npurified by meditation on that Self, such meditation being assisted by the\nseven means, viz. abstention, &c. (see above, p. 17). This intimates that the\nhighest Self is of pure goodness, precluding all evil, and therefore different\nin nature from everything else; for by the impure minded impure objects only\ncan be apprehended.--\'Having the vital breath for its body\' means--being the\nsupporter of all life in the world. To stand in\n\np. 262\n\nthe relation of a body to something else, means to abide in that other thing,\nto be dependent on it, and to subserve it in a subordinate capacity, as we\nshall fully show later on. And all \'vital breath\' or \'life\' stands in that\nrelation to the highest Self. \'Whose form is light\'; i.e. who is of supreme\nsplendour, his form being a divine one of supreme excellence peculiar to him,\nand not consisting of the stuff of Prak _ri_ ti.--\'Whose purposes are true\';\ni.e. whose purposes realise themselves without any obstruction. \'Who is the\n(or "of the") Self of ether\'; i.e. who is of a delicate and transparent\nnature, like ether; or who himself is the Self of ether, which is the causal\nsubstance of everything else; or who shines forth himself and makes other\nthings shine forth.--\'To whom all works belong\'; i.e. he of whom the whole\nworld is the work; or he to whom all activities belong.--\'To whom all wishes\nbelong\'; i.e. he to whom all pure objects and means of desire and enjoyment\nbelong. \'He to whom all odours and tastes belong\'; i.e. he to whom there\nbelong, as objects of enjoyment, all kinds of uncommon, special, perfect,\nsupremely excellent odours and tastes; ordinary smells and tastes being\nnegatived by another text, viz. \'That which is without sound, without touch,\nwithout taste,\' &c. (Ka. Up. I, 3, l5).--\'He who embraces all this\'; i.e. he\nwho makes his own the whole group of glorious qualities enumerated.--\'He who\ndoes not speak,\' because, being in possession of all he could desire, he \'has\nno regard for anything\'; i.e. he who, in full possession of lordly power,\nesteems this whole world with all its creatures no higher than a blade of\ngrass, and hence abides in silence.--All these qualities stated in the text\ncan belong to the highest Self only.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 3.
