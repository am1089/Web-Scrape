These are regular (oblations) at every sacrifice.\n\n5\\. The Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t comes before the Mahavyah _ri_ tis, if the\nsacrificial food is different from \xc3\x82 _g_ ya.\n\n6 6.

See the note on _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya I,\n9, 12.\n\n[279:6](sbe29159.htm#fr_700) See the note l.l.\xc2\x97I have altered the division of\nSutras 6 and 7, so as to draw the word vivahe to the seventh Sutra. The rule\nin \xc2\xa7 6 has an entirely general character; the formulas stated in \xc2\xa7 7 are given\nfor the particular occasion of the vivaha ceremony.\n\n[280:8](sbe29159.htm#fr_701) Taittiriya Sa _m_ hita III, 4, 6, 1: 'By what\nsacrifice he wishes to attain success, at that (sacrifice) he should make\noblations with them (i.e. with the Abhyatana Mantras): then he will attain\nsuccess by that sacrifice.'\n\n[280:9](sbe29159.htm#fr_702) Instead of sa i havya _h_ we ought to read\nprobably sa u havya _h_ , or, as the Taitt. Sa _m_ h. III, 4, 4, 1 gives, sa\nhi havya _h_. The Maitr. Sa _m_ h. has vihavya _h_ (II, 10, 2).\n\n[280:10](sbe29159.htm#fr_703) The words, 'in this power of holiness . . .\nsvaha!' are to be added to each member of the whole formula (comp. Atharva-\nveda V, 24). The expressions 'fathers' and 'grandfathers,' which are twice\nidentically repeated in the translation, stand the first time for pitara _h_\npitamaha _h_ , and then for tatas tatamaha _h_ of the Sanskrit text.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 6](sbe29160.htm)\n\n"
