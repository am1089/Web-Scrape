And on account of the declaration of the difference (of the two, the\nanandamaya cannot be the transmigrating soul).\n\nThe Self consisting of bliss cannot be identical with the transmigrating soul,\nfor that reason also that in the section treating of the Self of bliss, the\nindividual soul and the Self of bliss are distinctly represented as different;\nTaitt. Up. II, 7, 'It (i.e. the Self consisting of bliss) is a flavour; for\nonly after perceiving a flavour can this (soul) perceive bliss.' For he who\nperceives cannot be that which is perceived.--But, it may be asked, if he who\nperceives or attains cannot be that which is perceived or attained, how about\nthe following _S_ ruti- and Sm _ri_ ti-passages, 'The Self is to be sought;'\n'Nothing higher is known than the attainment of the Self 1?'--This objection,\nwe reply, is legitimate (from the point of view of absolute truth). Yet we see\nthat in ordinary life, the Self, which in reality is never anything\n\np. 70\n\nbut the Self, is, owing to non-comprehension of the truth, identified with the\nNon-Self, i.e. the body and so on; whereby it becomes possible to speak of the\nSelf in so far as it is identified with the body, and so on, as something not\nsearched for but to be searched for, not heard but to be heard, not seized but\nto be seized, not perceived but to be perceived, not known but to be known,\nand the like. Scripture, on the other hand, denies, in such passages as 'there\nis no other seer but he' (B _ri_. Up. III, 7, 23), that there is in reality\nany seer or hearer different from the all-knowing highest Lord. (Nor can it be\nsaid that the Lord is unreal because he is identical with the unreal\nindividual soul; for) 1 the Lord differs from the soul (vi _g \xc3\xb1_anatman) which\nis embodied, acts and enjoys, and is the product of Nescience, in the same way\nas the real juggler who stands on the ground differs from the illusive\njuggler, who, holding in his hand a shield and a sword, climbs up to the sky\nby means of a rope; or as the free unlimited ether differs from the ether of a\njar, which is determined by its limiting adjunct, (viz. the jar.) With\nreference to this fictitious difference of the highest Self and the individual\nSelf, the two last Sutras have been propounded.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[69:1](sbe34023.htm#fr_113) Yadi labdha na labdhavya _h_ katha _m_ tarhi\nparamatmano vastuto #bhinnena _g_ ivatmana paramatma labhyata ity artha _h_.\nBhamati.\n\n[70:1](sbe34023.htm#fr_114) Yatha parame _s_ varad bhinno _g_ ivatma drash _t_\na na bhavaty evam givatmano#pi drash _t_ ur na bhinna _h_ parame _s_ vara iti,\n_g_ ivasyanirva _k_ yatve parame _s_ varo#py anirva _k_ ya _h_ syad ity ata\naha parame _s_ varas tv avidyakalpitad iti. \xc3\x82nanda Giri.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 1, 18](sbe34024.htm)\n\n"
