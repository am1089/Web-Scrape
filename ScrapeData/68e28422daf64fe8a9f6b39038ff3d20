This triad that is won by the bright one\'s favor is hard to\ngain: humanity, aspiration, and rest in the great spirit. After gaining at\nlast a human birth, hard to win, then manhood and knowledge of the teaching,\nif one strives not after Freedom he is a fool. He, suicidal, destroys himself\nby grasping after the unreal. Who is more self-deluded than he who is careless\nof his own welfare after gaining a hard-won human birth and manhood, too? Let\nthem declare the laws, let them offer to the gods, let them perform all rites,\nlet them love the gods; without knowing the oneness with the Self,\' Freedom is\nnot won even in a hundred years of the Evolver. "There is no hope of\nimmortality through riches," says the scripture. It is clear from this that\nrites cannot lead to Freedom.\n\nTherefore let the wise one strive after Freedom,\n\np. 10\n\ngiving up all longing for sensual self-indulgence; approaching the good, great\nTeacher (the Higher Self), with soul intent on the object of the teaching. Let\nhim by the Self raise the Self, sunk in the ocean of the world, following the\npath of union through complete recognition of oneness. Setting all rites\naside, let the wise, learned ones who approach the study of the Self strive\nfor Freedom from the bondage of the world. Rites are to purify the thoughts,\nbut not to gain the reality. The real is gained by Wisdom, not by a myriad of\nrites. When one steadily examines and clearly sees a rope, the fear that it is\na serpent is destroyed. Knowledge is gained by discernment, by examining, by\ninstruction, but not by bathing, nor gifts, nor a hundred holdings of the\nbreath. Success demands first ripeness; questions of time and place are\nsubsidiary. Let the seeker after self-knowledge find the Teacher (the Higher\nSelf), full of kindness and knowledge of the Eternal.\n\n### THE FOUR PERFECTIONS\n\n(Verses 16--34)\n\nHe is ripe to seek the Self who is full of knowledge and wisdom, reason and\ndiscernment, and who bears the well-known marks.\n\nHe is ready to seek the Eternal who has Discernment and Dispassion; who has\nRestfulness and the other graces.\n\nFour perfections are numbered by the wise. When they are present there is\nsuccess, but in their absence is failure.\n\nFirst is counted the Discernment between things\n\np. 11\n\nlasting and unlasting. Next Dispassion, the indifference to self-indulgence\nhere and in paradise. Then the Six Graces, beginning with Restfulness. Then\nthe longing for Freedom.\n\nA certainty like this--the Eternal is real, the fleeting world is\nunreal;--this is that Discernment between things lasting and unlasting.\n\nAnd this is Dispassion--a perpetual willingness to give up all sensual self-\nindulgence--everything lower than the Eternal, through a constant sense of\ntheir insufficiency.\n\nThen the Six Graces: a steady intentness of the mind on its goal;--this is\nRestfulness.\n\nAnd the steadying of the powers that act and perceive, each in its own sphere,\nturning them back from sensuality;--this is Self-control.\n\nThen the raising of the mind above external things;--this is the true\nWithdrawal.\n\nThe enduring of all ills without petulance and without self-pity;--this is the\nright Endurance.\n\nAn honest confidence in the teaching and the Teacher;--this is that Faith by\nwhich the treasure is gained.\n\nThe intentness of the soul on the pure Eternal;--this is right Meditation, but\nnot the indulgence of fancy.\n\nThe wish to untie, by discernment of their true nature, all the bonds woven by\nunwisdom, the bonds of selfishness and sensuality;--this is the longing for\nFreedom.\n\nThough at first imperfect, these qualities gradually growing through\nDispassion, Restfulness, and the other graces and the Teacher\'s help will gain\ntheir due.\n\np. 12\n\nWhen Dispassion and longing for Freedom are strong, then Restfulness and the\nother graces will bear fruit.\n\nBut when these two--Dispassion and longing for Freedom--are lacking, then\nRestfulness and the other graces are a mere appearance, like water in the\ndesert.\n\nChief among the, causes of Freedom is devotion, the intentness of the soul on\nits own nature. Or devotion may be called intentness on the reality of the\nSelf.\n\nLet him who possesses these Perfections and who would learn the reality of the\nSelf, approach the wise Teacher (the Higher Self), from whom comes the loosing\nof bonds; who: is full of knowledge and perfect; who is not beaten by desire,\nwho really knows the Eternal; who has found rest in the Eternal, at peace like\na fuelless fire; who is full of selfless kindness, the friend of all that\nlives. Serving the Teacher with devotion and aspiration for the Eternal, and\nfinding harmony with him, seek the needed knowledge of the Self.\n\n### THE APPEAL TO THE HIGHER SELF\n\n(Verses 35--40)\n\n"I submit myself to thee, Master, friend of the bowed-down world and river of\nselfless kindness.\n\n"Raise me by thy guiding light that pours forth the nectar of truth and mercy,\nfor I am sunk in the ocean of the world.\n\n"I am burned by the hot flame of relentless life and torn by the winds of\nmisery: save me from death, for I take refuge in thee, finding no other rest."\n\nThe great good ones dwell in peace, bringing joy to the world like the return\nof spring. Having crossed the\n\np. 13\n\nocean of the world, they ever help others to cross over. For this is the very\nnature of the great-souled ones (Mahatmas)--their swiftness to take away the\nweariness of others. So the soft-rayed moon of itself soothes the earth,\nburned by the fierce sun\'s heat.\n\n"Sprinkle me with thy nectar voice that brings the joy of eternal bliss, pure\nand cooling, falling on me as from a cup, like the joy of inspiration; for I\nam burnt by the hot, scorching flames of the world\'s fire.\n\n"Happy are they on whom thy light rests, even for a moment, and who reach\nharmony with thee.\n\n"How shall I cross the ocean of the world? Where is the path? What way must I\nfollow? I know not, Master. Save me from the wound of the world\'s pain."\n\n### THE BEGINNING OF THE TEACHING\n\n(Verses 41--71)\n\nTo him, making this appeal and seeking help, scorched by the flame of the\nworld\'s fire, the Great Soul beholding him with eyes most pitiful brings\nspeedy comfort.\n\nThe Wise One instils the truth in him who has approached him longing for\nFreedom, who is following the true path, calming the tumult of his mind and\nbringing Restfulness.\n\n"Fear not, wise one, there is no danger for thee. There is a way to cross over\nthe ocean of the world, and by this path the sages have reached the shore.\n\n"This same path I point out to thee, for it is the way to destroy the world\'s\nfear. Crossing the ocean of the\n\np. 14\n\nworld by this path, thou shalt win the perfect joy."\n\nBy discerning the aim of the wisdom-teaching (Vedanta) is born that most\nexcellent knowledge. Then comes the final ending of the world\'s pain. The\nvoice of the teaching plainly declares that faith, devotion, meditation, and\nthe search for union are the means of Freedom for him who would be free. He\nwho is perfect in these wins Freedom from the bodily bondage woven by\nunwisdom.\n\nWhen the Self is veiled by unwisdom there arises a binding to the not-self,\nand from this comes the pain of world-life. The fire of wisdom lit by\ndiscernment between these two--Self and not-Self--will wither up the source of\nunwisdom, root and all.\n\n### THE PUPIL ASKS\n\n"Hear with selfless kindness, Master. I ask this question: receiving the\nanswer from thy lips I shall gain my end.\n\n"What is, then, a bond? And how has this bond come? What cause has it? And how\ncan one be free?\n\n"What is not-Self and what the Higher Self? And how can one discern between\nthem?"\n\n### THE MASTER ANSWERS\n\n"Happy art thou. Thou shalt attain thy end. Thy kin is blest in thee. For thou\nseekest to become the Eternal by freeing thyself from the bond of unwisdom.\n\n"Sons and kin can pay a father\'s debts, but none but a man\'s self can set him\nfree,\n\np. 15\n\n"If a heavy burden presses on the head others can remove it, but none but a\nman\'s self can quench his hunger and thirst.\n\n"Health is gained by the sick who follow the path of healing: health does not\ncome through the acts of others.\n\n"The knowledge of the real by the eye of clear insight is to be gained by\none\'s own sight and not by the teacher\'s.\n\n"The moon\'s form must be seen by one\'s own eyes; it can never be known through\nthe eyes of another.\n\n"None but a man\'s self is able to untie the knots of unwisdom, desire, and\nformer acts, even in a myriad of ages.\n\n"Freedom is won by a perception of the Self\'s oneness with the Eternal, and\nnot by the doctrines of Union or of Numbers, nor by rites and sciences.\n\n"The form and beauty of the lyre and excellent skill upon its strings may give\ndelight to the people, but will never found an empire.\n\n"An eloquent voice, a stream of words, skill in explaining the teaching, and\nthe learning of the learned; these bring enjoyment but not freedom.\n\n"When the Great Reality is not known the study of the scriptures is fruitless;\nwhen the Great Reality is known the study of the scriptures is also fruitless.\n\n"A net of words is a great forest where the fancy wanders; therefore the\nreality of the Self is to be strenuously learned from the knower of that\nreality.\n\n"How can the hymns (Vedas) and the scriptures profit him who is bitten by the\nserpent of unwisdom?\n\np. 16\n\n[paragraph continues] How can charms or medicine help him without the medicine\nof the knowledge of the Eternal?\n\n"Sickness is not cured by saying \'Medicine,\' but by drinking it. So a man is\nnot set free by the name of the Eternal without discerning the Eternal.\n\n"Without piercing through the visible, without knowing the reality of the\nSelf, how can men gain Freedom by mere outward words that end with utterances?\n\n"Can a man be king by saying, \'I am king,\' without destroying his enemies,\nwithout gaining power over the whole land?\n\n"Through information, digging, and casting aside the stones, a treasure may be\nfound, but not by calling it to come forth.\n\n"So by steady effort is gained the knowledge of those who know the Eternal,\nthe lonely, stainless reality above all illusion; but not by desultory study.\n\n"Hence with all earnest effort to be free from the bondage of the world, the\nwise must strive themselves, as they would to be free from sickness.\n\n"And this question put by thee to-day must be solved by those who seek\nFreedom; this question that breathes the spirit of the teaching, that is like\na clue with hidden meaning.\n\n"Hear, then, earnestly, thou wise one, the answer given by me; for\nunderstanding it thou shalt be free from the bondage of the world."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Self, Potencies, Vestures](cjw06.htm)\n\n'
