If he wishes to have a house built, he draws with an Udumbara branch\nthree times a line round (the building-ground) with (the words), 'Here I\ninclude the dwellings for the sake of food,' and sacrifices in (its) centre on\nan elevated spot,\n\n2\\. (With the texts,) 'Who art thou? Whose art\n\np. 93\n\nthou? To whom do I sacrifice thee, desirous of (dwelling in the) village?\nSvaha!\n\n'Thou art the gods' share on this (earth). From here have sprung the fathers\nwho have passed away. The ruler has sacrificed, desirous of (dwelling in the)\nvillage, not omitting anything that belongs to the gods. Svaha!'\n\n3\\.

On the house of the Vedic Indians,\ncomp. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, pp. 148 seqq.\n\n[93:9](sbe29050.htm#fr_207) On parisrut, see Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p.\n281. The words bhuvanas pari give no sense; Paraskara probably gives the true\nreading, a vatso _g_ agadai _h_ saha (III, 4, 4; comp. Sutra 8: Vasu _m_ _s_\n_k_ a Rudran \xc3\x82dityan \xc3\x8e _s_ ana _m_ _g_ agadai _h_ saha; _g_ agada is explained\nin _G_ ayarama's commentary by anuga, anu _k_ ara). The word _g_ agada of\ncourse was exposed to all sorts of corruptions; p. 94 thus the text of \xc3\x82 _s_\nvalayana has _g_ ayata _m_ saka; the Atharva-veda (III, 12, 7) _g_ agata saha;\nand from this _g_ agat to the bhuvana found in our text the way is not very\nlong.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3](sbe29051.htm)\n\n"
