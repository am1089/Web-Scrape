This high and holy name  \nThy rites have won, thy merits claim.'  \n\nThus spoke the Lord whom Gods revere.  \nAnd sought again his heavenly sphere.  \nBut Vis'vamitra, more intent,  \nHis mind to sterner penance bent.  \n\nSo many a season rolled away,  \nWhen Menaka, fair nymph, one day  \nCame down from Paradise to lave  \nHer perfect limbs in Pushkar's wave,  \nThe glorious son of Kus'ik saw  \nThat peerless shape without a flaw  \nFlash through the flood's translucent shroud  \nLike lightning gleaning through a cloud.  \nHe saw her in that lone retreat,  \nMost beautiful from head to feet,  \nAnd by Kandarpas 1 might subdued  \nHe thus addressed her as he viewed:  \n'Welcome, sweet nymph! O deign, I pray,  \nIn these calm shades awhile to stay.  \nTo me some gracious favour show,  \nFor love has set my breast aglow.'  \n\nHe spoke. The fairest of the fair  \nMade for awhile her dwelling there,  \nWhile day by day the wild delight  \nStayed vow austere and fervent rite  \nThere as tne winsome charmer wove  \nHer spells around him in the grove,  \nAnd bound him in a golden chain,  \nFive sweet years fled, and five again.  \nThen Vis'vamitra woke to shame,  \nAnd, fraught with anguish, memory came  \nFor quick he knew, with anger fired,  \nThat all the Immortals had conspired  \n\np. 75  \n\nTo lap his careless soul in ease,  \nAnd mar his long austerities.  \n'Ten years have past, each day and night  \nUnheeded in delusive flight.  \nSo long my fervent rites were stayed,  \nWhile thus I lay by love betrayed.'  \nAs thus long sighs the hermit heaved,  \nAnd, touched with deep repentance, grieved,  \nHe saw the fair one standing nigh  \nWith suppliant hands and trembling eye.  \nWith gentle words he bade her go,  \nThen sought the northern hills of snow.  \nWith firm resolve he vowed to beat  \nThe might of love beneath his feet.  \nStill northward to the distant side  \nOf Kaus'iki, 1 the hermit hide,  \nAnd gave his life to penance there  \nWith rites austere most hard to bear.  \nA thousand years went by, and still  \nHe laboured on the northern hill  \nWith pains so terrible and drear  \nThat all the Gods were chilled with fear,  \nAnd Gods and saints, for swift advice,  \nMet in the halls of Paradise.  \n'Let Kus'ik's son,' they counselled, be  \nA Mighty saint by just decree.'  \nHis ear to hear their counsel lent  \nThe Sire of worlds, omnipotent.  \nTo him enriched by rites severe  \nHe spoke in accents sweet to hear:  \n'Hail, Mighty Saint! dear son, all hail!  \nThy fervour wins, thy toils prevail.  \nWon by thy vows and zeal intense  \nI give this high preeminence.'  \nHe to the General Sire replied,  \n\nNot sad, nor wholly satisfied:  \n'When thou, O Brahma, shalt declare  \nThe title, great beyond compare,  \nOf Brahman saint my worthy meed,  \nHard earned by many a holy deed,  \nThen may I deem in sooth I hold  \nEach sense of body well controlled.'  \nThen Brahma cried, 'Not yet, not yet:  \nToil on awhile O Anchoret!'  \n\nThus having said to heaven he went,  \nThe saint, upon his task intent,  \nBegan his labours to renew,  \nWhich sterner yet and fiercer grew.  \nHis arms upraised, without a rest,  \nWith but one foot the earth he pressed;  \nThe air his food, the hermit stood  \nStill as a pillar hewn from wood.  \nAround him in the summer days  \nFive mighty fires combined to blaze.  \nIn floods of rain no veil was spread  \nSave clouds, to canopy his head.  \nIn the dank dews both night and day  \nCouched in the stream the hermit lay.  \nThus, till a thousand years had fled,  \nHe plied his task of penance dread.  \nThen Vishnu and the Gods with awe  \nThe labours of the hermit saw,  \nAnd S'akra, in his troubled breast,  \nLord of the skies, his fear confessed.  \nAnd brooded on a plan to spoil  \nThe merits of the hermit's toil.  \nEncompassed by his Gods of Storm  \nHe summoned Rambha, fair of form,  \nAnd spoke a speech for woe and weal,  \nThe saint to mar, the God to heal.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[74:1](ry063.htm#fr_243) The Indian Cupid.\n\n[75:1](ry063.htm#fr_244) 'The same as she whose praises Vis'vamitra has\nalready sung in Canto XXXV, and whom the poet brings yet alive upon the scene\nin Canto LXI. Her proper name was _Satyavat i_ (Truthful); the patronymic,\nKaus'iki was preserved by the river into which she is said to have been\nchanged, and is still recognized in the corrupted forms Kus'a and Kus'i. The\nriver flows from the heights of the Himalaya towards the Ganges, bounding on\nthe east the country of Videha (Behar). The name is no doubt half hidden in\nthe _Cosoagus_ of Pliny and the _Kossounos_ of Arrian. But each author has\nfallen into the same error in his enumeration of these rivers (Condochatem,\nErannoboam, Cosoagum, Sonum). The Erannoboas, (Hiranyavaha) and the Sone are\nnot different streams, but well-known names of the same river. Moreover the\norder is disturbed, in which on the right and left they fall into the Ganges.\nTo be consistent with geography it should be written: Erannoboam sive Sonum,\nCondochatem (Gandaki), Cosoagum.'
