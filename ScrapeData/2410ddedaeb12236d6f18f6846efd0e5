Phases of the Self.--The highest existence is thus Thought without\nthinking, the state in which the soul has no consciousness of any external\nobject, or indeed of any object at all, strictly speaking, for it is itself in\nconscious identity with the sum of all being or Universal Idea; "whilst he\nseeth not a thing, yet doth he see, though he see not the thing erstwhile to\nbe seen. He that hath sight loseth not his sight, for it is imperishable. But\nthere is naught beside\n\np. 36\n\nhim, naught apart from him, that he may see" (B.A. IV. iii. 23).\n\nThe only analogy that experience furnishes for this supposed condition of soul\nis that of dreamless sleep; and it was inferred that in such sleep the soul is\nactually in this transcendent state.\n\nBesides this, the earlier Upanishads recognise two other states of the soul,\nwaking and dreaming. When awake the soul puts forth out of itself a world of\nsense and organs of sense and empirical thought, and renders itself the\nsubject of the experiences conjured up by them. In dreaming sleep the sense-\norgans swoon away and are absorbed into the _manas,_ the organ forming the\ncentre of empirical cognition and will (\xc2\xa7 18), which thus has now the vision\nof the world as it is reflected from the waking state; at the same time the\n"life-breaths," _pr \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as,_ are active as in waking.\n\nThe later Upanishads assume yet another phase, which they call the "Fourth"\n_(tur \xc4\xabya, chaturtha)_. In this the soul, transcending dreamless sleep, is\nabsolutely wakeful in its union with the universal subject of thought, and\nexercises in perfect stillness an infinite real consciousness of all in the\nSelf which is different in kind from the "unconscious consciousness" ascribed\nto dreamless sleep.\n\nThe waking, dreaming, and dreamless phases are respectively termed _Vai\n\xc5\x9bv\xc4\x81nara_ ("common to all mankind"), _Taijasa_ ("luminous," for in\n\np. 37\n\ndreams the soul is its own light, B.A. IV. iii. 9), and _Pr \xc4\x81jna_\n("intelligent," for in deep sleep the Self is one with the Universal Idea or\n"intelligent Self," _pr \xc4\x81jna \xc4\x81tm\xc4\x81,_ B.A. IV. iii. 21); these terms do not\noccur until M\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8d. iii. ff. On _dreaming sleep_ see also B.A. II. i. 18 (soul\nwanders about within the body), IV. iii. 9-14 (two accounts, in one of which\nsoul leaves the body, while in the other it remains in it), iii. 20 f., Ch.\nVIII. x. 2, Pra. IV. 2 f. _Dreamless sleep,_ B.A. IV. iii. 19-33, Ch. VIII.\nvi. 3, x.-xi. _Fourth State,_ M\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8d. VII., Maitr. VI. 19, VII. 11, M\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc5\xabkya-\nk\xc4\x81rik\xc4\x81 I. 12-16, III. 33 f. See also \xc5\x9aankara on Brahma-s\xc5\xabtra I. iii. 19 f., 40\nf., III. ii. 1 f. \xc5\x9aankara, following Ch. IV. iii. 3, holds that in deep sleep,\nin which the soul is in temporary identity with Brahma, the functions of\nsense, together with the _manas,_ in which they are absorbed, are merged in\nthe "breaths" travelling through the pericardium and veins (cf. \xc2\xa7 18), while\nthe soul becomes one with the Brahma residing under "determinations" in the\nheart (in B.A. II. i. 19, it rests in the pericardium, in Ch. VIII. vi. 3 in\nthe veins). The statement of Ch. VIII. xii. 3, that "the Calm _(sampras \xc4\x81da)_,\nrising from this body, wins to the Supreme Light, and shows itself in its own\nform; this is the highest spirit _(purusha)_ " is taken by \xc5\x9aankara (on Brahma-\ns\xc5\xabtra IV. iv. 1 f.) as referring to the soul not in dreamless sleep, but in\nits final release from the body after enlightenment (see \xc2\xa7 24); this "own\nform" is the existence\n\np. 38\n\nof the soul in its absolute selfhood, where there is no longer a distinction\nbetween individual and universal soul. For the theories of the Ved\xc4\x81nta after\n\xc5\x9aankara see above, \xc2\xa7 12.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Maya](brk19.htm)\n\n'
