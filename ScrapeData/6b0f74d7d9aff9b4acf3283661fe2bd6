Vyasa said :-- O King! Speaking these harsh and cruel words to the King,\nthe Muni took that money and went away. When Vis\xc2\x92vamitra went away, the King\nHaris\xc2\x92chandra became very much perplexed with sorrows and sighed frequently.\nHe then began to say with his face bent downwards. \xc2\x93Suffering from constant\npain and troubles, I am now turned into a Preta; if anybody finds me\nserviceable, he may purchase me with value in gold as proper; but he should do\nthis quickly before the sun sets.\xc2\x94 Dharma, then, assuming the form of a\nheartless\n\n\n\np. 670\n\n\n\nCha _nd_ ala, came there quickly to test Haris\xc2\x92chandra. The body of that low\nmean person was of a black colour, his air looking ferocious, his belly\nelongated, body emitting stench odours, teeth very long, and his face, covered\nwith beards. He had one bamboo in his hand; in his neck, the bones of the dead\nwere hanging and his chest was very distorted.\n\n\n\n6\\. The Cha _nd_ ala said :-- \xc2\x93I am in urgent need of a servant; I will keep\nyou as my slave; say, then, quickly what is your price?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n7\\. Vyasa said :-- O King! When the cruel, extremely ferocious and heartless\nCha _nd_ ala said thus, the King Haris\xc2\x92chandra was surprised to see his\nappearance and said :-- \xc2\x93Who are you?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n8-12. The Cha _nd_ ala said :-- \xc2\x93O King! I am the famous Cha _nd_ ala,\nPravira; you will have to remain always subject to me and to collect the\nclothes of the dead persons.\xc2\x94 Hearing his word, the King said, \xc2\x93I want to be\npurchased by a Brahmi _n_ or a K _s_ attriya. See! The sages say, that the\nDharma of good people is excellent; the Dharma of the persons intermediate is\nmiddling; and the Dharma of the mean is depressing. You belong to the low and\nmean class. So my Dharma cannot be observed if I remain in your house.\xc2\x94 The\nCha _nd_ ala said :-- \xc2\x93O King! This is the Dharma of yours now mentioned by\nyou; then why did you mention that anybody can purchase you; without any\nprevious consideration, you spoke before me. He who speaks with\npreconsideration attains his desired object; but, O Sinless One! You did not\nconsider and you spoke that ordinarily. However, if I take your words that you\nspoke first to be true, then you are no doubt, purchased by me.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n13\\. Haris\xc2\x92chandra said :-- The villain that speaks untruth, goes downright to\na terrible hell; so to become a Cha _nd_ ala is far better for me than to use\nan untrue word.\n\n\n\n14-15. Vyasa said :-- O King! When the King was speaking thus, the ascetic\nVis\xc2\x92vamitra arrived there out of anger and impatience; he rolled his eyes and\nsaid :-- This Cha _nd_ ala is come to give you your desired money; why, then,\nare you not giving me the remnant of my Dak _s_ i _n_ a!\n\n\n\n16\\. Haris\xc2\x92chandra said :-- \xc2\x93O Kaus'ika! Nothing is unknown to you. My this\nbody is born for the Solar Line; how then can I accept this slavery of a Cha\n_nd_ ala!\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n17-20. Vis\xc2\x92vamitra said :-- If you do not sell yourself to a Cha _nd_ ala, be\ncertain that I will just now put you under my curse. Give me immediately\n\n\n\np. 671\n\n\n\nmy Dak _s_ i _n_ a, be it whether from a Cha _nd_ ala or from a Brahma _n_ a.\nThere is no other purchaser at present than this Cha _nd_ ala. But know this\nas certain that I won\xc2\x92t go back until I get my money. O King! If you do not\ngive me money just now, then when half the Ghatika of the day is remaining, I\nwill burn you up by my fire of anger.\n\n\n\n2l. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing these words of Vis\xc2\x92vamitra, the King became\nalmost dead; bewildered with fear, then he clasped the feet of the Ri _s_ i\nand said, \xc2\x93Be friendly, please.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n22-23. Haris\xc2\x92chandra said :-- \xc2\x93O Viprar _s_ i! I am now very humiliated and\nhave become very afflicted and distressed. Especially I am your Bhakta, I am\nyour servant; so be graciously pleased and free me from this painful companion\nof a Cha _nd_ ala. O Muni! In lieu of my remnant Dak _s_ i _n_ a, I will be\nyour obedient slave; I will do your work and follow your commands.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n24\\. Visvamitra said :-- \xc2\x93O King! You are then my slave, you will obey always\nmy commands.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n25-26. Vyasa said :-- O King! When Vis\xc2\x92vamitra said so, the King, out of joy,\nthought that he regained his life and said to Kaus\xc2\x92ika. Always I will obey\nyour words; now order me what work I will have to do.\n\n\n\n27-28. Vis\xc2\x92vamitra, then addressed the Cha _nd_ ala and said :-- \xc2\x93O Cha _nd_\nala! Come to me and give me the price for this slave. I am now handing this\nslave over to you; give me the price and take him. I want money; I have no\nneed for a servant.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n29\\. Vyasa said :-- O King! When Vis\xc2\x92vamitra spoke thus, the Cha _nd_ ala,\noverflowed with joy, came immediately to the Ri _s_ i Vis\xc2\x92vamitra and said :--\n\n\n\n30\\. O Dvija! The relief that you have given me by selling this servant, for\nthat I will give you the ten Yoyanas wide land of Prayaga Ma _nd_ alam,\ncovered over with jewels.\n\n\n\n31-36. Vyasa said :-- O King! The Cha _nd_ ala then gave one thousand gems,\none thousand jewels, one thousand pearls and one thousand gold Mohurs and\nVis\xc2\x92vamitra took them. No signs of distraction nor unpleasantness were visible\non the face of the King Haris\xc2\x92chandra. Rather he laid hold of his patience and\nthought within himself, \xc2\x93Vis\xc2\x92vamitra is now my master; I will do any work that\nhe puts\n\n\n\np. 672\n\n\n\nme in.\xc2\x94 At this time, the incorporeal voice, the voice of the fourth\ndimensional space, sounded from the Heavens :-- \xc2\x93O Fortunate One! You are\nfreed from the Dak _s_ i _n_ a, the debt before that you promised to give me.\xc2\x94\nA shower of flowers fell on the head of the King from the Heavens. At this\ntime the powerful Indra and the other hosts of the Devas praised the King,\nsaying :-- \xc2\x93Sadhu! Sadhu! Well-done, Well-done.\xc2\x94 The heart of the King was\nthen filled with intense joy and the King then said to Kaus\xc2\x92ika :--\n\n\n\n37-38. O Intelligent One! You are a greater benefactor to me than my father,\nmother and friend as you have freed me in a moment from my debts. So, O mighty\narmed one! Your words are beneficial to me. Now order what am I to do.\n\n\n\n39\\. When the King said so, Vis\xc2\x92vamitra then said :-- Go and observe from\ntoday the words of the Cha _nd_ ala. Let good befall on you! Thus saying, the\nMahar _s_ i Vis\xc2\x92vamitra took the money given by the Cha _nd_ ala and went away\nto his own place.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-third Chapter of the Seventh Book on the King\nHaris\xc2\x92chandra\xc2\x92s acknowledging of the slavery of the Cha _nd_ ala in the\nMahapura _n_ am S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, of 18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i\nVeda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 24](bk07ch24.htm)\n\n"
