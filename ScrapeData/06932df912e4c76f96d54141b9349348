Huri started from Dwarka\nwith several of the descendants of Judoo, and went to Hustinapoor. On hearing\nthe news of his arrival, Joodisthur, Urjoon, Bheem, Nukool and Suhdeo, five\nbrothers, rose up with the greatest delight; and, having gone outside the\ncity, and met Krishnu with a most cordial reception, escorted him to their\nhouse. As they were entering the house, Koontee and Dropudee summoned seven\nmarried women: and having filled up a square with pearls, placed a chair of\ngold upon it, upon which they seated Shree Krishnu. Having caused all kinds of\nfestive rejoicings to be made, they performed the ceremony of " _Arta_ " with\ntheir own hands; and washing his feet, they conducted him to the banquetting\nroom, and feasted him with all sorts of delicacies.\n\nO great king! when Shree Krishnu Chund had finished his repast, and began to\neat betel, Koontee sat next him, and entering into conversation enquired after\nher father and brother: "Are Soorsen and Basoodeo, my brother, and my nephew,\nBuldeo, well? in whom my soul is bound up; who,\n\np. 262\n\nexcept you, can drive away affliction and grief? You afforded me protection,\nwhen great calamity befel me. O Krishnu! you are the dispeller of the sorrows\nof others: your five brothers fly to you for refuge; as the doe dreads a herd\nof wolves, so do Doorjodhun\'s subjects dread him."\n\nO great king! when Koontee had thus spoken, Joodisthur joined his hands and\nsaid, "You, O Krishnu! are chief and lord of the Judoos. Devotees meditate\nconstantly upon you, and not upon Shivu and Bruhmu. What meritorious act have\nI performed, that you have visited me in my own house. Gratify me by remaining\nfour months, and return home after the rainy season."\n\nHaving recited thus much, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great king! on hearing\nthese words, Shree Beharee, the friend of his worshippers, having inspired\nthem all with hope and confidence, remained there; and added daily to their\njoy and delight. One day, Shree Krishnu Chund taking a bow and arrows in his\nhand, went in a chariot to hunt in the forest, accompanied by the five\nbrothers; and on arrival there, dismounting from his chariot, and fastening\nhis belt, prepared to shoot his arrows; and, beating the jungle, began to kill\nlions, tigers, rhinoceroses, wild buffaloes, and deer and antelopes of\ndifferent kinds; and brought all his game to the Raja Joodisthur, who\ndistributed some of it, and sent some for the supply of his own table. Whilst\nShree Krishnu Chund and Urjoon were engaged in sport, they advanced some\ndistance beyond the rest of the party, and stood under a tree. They then both\nwent to the banks of a river, and drank some water. At this time Shree Krishnu\nJee saw on the river-bank a very beautiful young virgin, with a face like the\nmoon, of the colour of the flower chumpa, with eyes like those of a deer, a\nvoice like the kokila, the gait of an elephant and a waist like a lion\'s;\nornamented from head to foot, having imbibed the spirit of Kamu (Cupid,) of a\nmost brilliant appearance, wandering about alone. Huri was amazed and struck\nwith astonishment at beholding her, and\n\np. 263\n\nsaid, "Who is that beautiful creature, with such a charming figure, wandering\nabout without a companion?"\n\nO great king! when Krishnu had thus spoken, Urjoon, who saw her also, ran\nhurriedly to the spot, where the lovely girl was wandering about, exulting on\nthe river-bank, and began to address her, "Say, beauteous damsel, who art\nthou, and whence hast thou come, and why art thou wandering here alone?\nExplain this strange mystery to me." On hearing these words, the beautiful\ngirl explained her history, "I am a virgin daughter of the sun, my name is\nKalindee; my father appointed me an abode in water. He came and having built\nfor me a house in the river, thus instructed me, \'Continue wandering, O\ndaughter! near the river, where you will meet with a husband. Krishnu will\ndescend upon the earth in the family of Judoo, and will come after you to the\nplace of your wandering, the first male, the immortal Huri, for whom you have\nbeen born.\' From the time my father, the sun, thus spoke to me, I have longed\nfor the approach of Huri."\n\nUrjoon, O great king! was very much pleased to hear these words, and said, "O\nbeauteous creature! the immortal lord, the inhabitant of Dwarka, Shree Krishnu\nChund, the root of joy, for whose sake thou art wandering here, has arrived."\nWhen Urjoon, O great king! had thus spoken, Shree Beharee, the friend of his\nworshippers, came up in his chariot. When, on beholding Krishnu, Urjoon\nexplained her history to him, Shree Krishnu Chund Jee smiled, and quickly\nplacing her upon his chariot, returned towards the city. And Bishookurma,\nconsulting privately the taste and wishes of Shree Krishnu Chund, built a most\nbeautiful palace, whilst Krishnu was coming from the forest to the city: and\nbrought Kalindee there, and abode there himself. Sometime after this, on one\noccasion Shree Krishnu Chund and Urjoon were sitting together at night, when\nthe element fire having conic, said to Huri, joining his hands and bowing his\nhead, "O great king!\n\np. 264\n\n[paragraph continues] I have wandered about the whole world for a long time in\na state of hunger, and have not obtained any thing to eat. My only hope is in\nyou: with your permission, I will go and devour the forests and jungles."\nKrishnu granted him permission. Fire then said, "O lord of compassion! I\ncannot go into the jungle alone: if I do, Indru will come and extinguish me."\nOn hearing this, Shree Krishnu Jee said to Urjoon, "Brother! go and allow Fire\nto eat some food: he is dying from excessive hunger."\n\nO great king! when Shree Krishnu Chund Jee had thus spoken, Urjoon accompanied\nFire with his bow and arrows; who having reached the jungle blazed forth, and\nbegan to burn up mango, tamarind and every kind of tree, and the grass and\nbamboos crackled with a loud noise; and the animals in the forest wandered\nabout, losing their road. On all sides fire raged and spread in the forest;\nand smoke ascended in wreaths to the sky. On perceiving the smoke, Indru\nsummoned the lord of the clouds and said, "Go and shower down rain most\ncopiously, and put out the fire, and save the lives of the beasts and birds,\nand animals of the forest." Having received this order, the lord of the\nclouds, taking masses of clouds with him, came there, and began to thunder:\nand as he was on the point of pouring down rain, Urjoon discharged such arrows\nof wind, that the clouds were dispersed, and blown in every direction; like\nflocks of cotton, driven about by gusts of air. No one saw them come, or\ndepart, they vanished as they came; and fire, burning up the forest and\njungle, came to the abode of a demon, named Mye. Beholding Fire approach, full\nof rage, Mye was terrified: and coming out of his house, with naked feet, and\na cloth thrown about his neck, came and stood in Fire\'s presence with joined\nhands; and prostrating himself so as to touch the ground with the eight\nprincipal parts of his body, said, most beseechingly, "O lord! O lord! save me\nquickly from this fire, and protect me, O deity of fire! you\n\np. 265\n\nhave obtained a satiety of food, do not now meditate any crime, listen to my\nsupplications, and save me from Fire."\n\nO great king! when the demon Mye had thus spoken, the deity of fire laid hold\nof his fiery arrows; and even Urjoon started with amazement. At length, they\nboth took Mye with them to Shree Krishnu Chund, the root of joy, and said, "O\ngreat king! this demon Mye will be of use, and will build a place of abode for\nyou. Take thought now of Mye; and, having extinguished the fire, banish all\nhis fears." Having thus spoken, Urjoon placed his bow, Gandeeb, and arrows\nupon the ground; and Krishnu, looking towards the deity of fire, made a sign\nby winking his eye, and the fire was put out immediately; and the whole forest\nbecame cool. Shree Krishnu Chund then went on with Urjoon and Mye. There Mye\nerected, in a second, a most beautiful, elegant and fascinating house of gold,\nstudded with gems; a description of the beauty of which is impossible; whoever\ncame to see it, stood gazing like a picture with astonishment. Shree Krishnu\nJee remained there four months, and came thence to the royal court of\nJoodisthur; and, on arrival, he solicited the Raja\'s permission to go to\nDwarka; when they heard this request, Raja Joodisthur and his whole court were\nvery sad, and there was great anxiety amongst the women in the female\napartments. At length Krishnu having entered into suitable explanations with\nthem all, and inspired them with confidence, took leave of Joodisthur,\naccompanied by Urjoon. Having left Hustinapoor, he arrived in a few days,\nafter a very pleasant trip, at Dwarka. Joy was spread through the city on the\nnews of his arrival; and the pangs of separation, which they had all endured,\nwere felt no longer. His mother and father, on seeing their son\'s face were\ndelighted; and forgot all their sorrows. Shree Krishnu Jee went, on a\nsubsequent day, to the Raja Oogursen, and explained the history of Kalindee,\n"O great king! I have brought Kalindee, the daughter of the sun, marry her to\nme in the manner prescribed by the\n\np. 266\n\n[paragraph continues] Vedas." On hearing this, Oogursen gave an order to one\nof his ministers "To go immediately and prepare all things necessary for the\nmarriage." On receipt of the order, the minister immediately procured all that\nwas required. Oogursen and Basoodeo then sent for an astrologer, and having\nfixed upon a lucky day, united Shree Krishnu Jee in marriage to Kalindee,\naccording to the forms and ceremonies prescribed by the Vedas. Having recited\nthus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--Raja! in this manner\nKalindee was married; I will now mention, how Huri brought away and married\nMittrabinda; listen with attention. Mittrabinda was the daughter of Rajdhewee,\nthe aunt of Krishnu and Soorsen\'s daughter. When she was marriageable, she\nselected a husband for herself. Rajas from all countries were collected\ntogether on the occasion, possessed of many eminent mental qualities, very\nhandsome, intelligent, powerful, courageous, brave and resolute, and dressed\nand decked out, so as each to rival the other. Having received intelligence of\nthis event, Shred Krishnu Chund Jee went, accompanied by Urjoon, and stood\namongst the rest of the party, assembled on the occasion. The girl was\ndelighted at seeing Krishnu; throwing a garland on his neck, she remained\ngazing on his countenance.\n\nO great king! all the Rajas were ashamed, and displeased on observing this\nproceeding; and Doorjodhun went to her brother, Mittrasen, and said "Brother!\nHuri is your uncle\'s son, with whom your sister has fallen in love. This is\ncontrary to the custom of the world, and the world will laugh at such\nbehaviour; go and advise your sister not to marry Krishnu, otherwise the whole\ncrowd of Rajas will laugh." Upon this Mittrasen went and advised his sister\nagainst the marriage.\n\nO great king! when Mittrabinda, listening to the advice of her brother,\nwithdrew and stood apart at some distance from Krishnu, Urjoon leaning forward\nwhispered in his ear, "O great king! what are you hesitating about? the\nbusiness is a failure; carry into execution immediately, and without delay,\n\np. 267\n\nany plan you may have formed." When Urjoon had thus spoken, Shree Krishnu Jee\ninstantly seized Mittrabinda\'s hand in the midst of the assembled party; and,\ncarrying her off, placed her on his chariot, and drove off in sight of them\nall. The Rajas seized their arms, and mounting their horses, and circling\nround to the front of Krishnu, stood in battle order. And the people in the\ncity laughing, and clapping their hands together, played upon musical\ninstruments; and pouring forth abuse, began to say, "Krishnu has come to marry\nhis father\'s sister\'s daughter; a notable act no doubt, which will make him\nvery famous."\n\nShree Shookdeo Jee, having narrated thus much of the history, said,--O great\nking! when Shree Krishnu Chund saw that he was surrounded on all sides by the\narmy of demons, and could not avoid fighting, he drew forth several arrows\nfrom his quiver; and bending his bow, discharged them in such a manner, that\nthe whole army of demons was scattered and dispersed in every direction, and\nKrishnu arrived safely at Dwarka, and free from all alarm.\n\nShree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great king! in this manner Shree Krishnu Jee took\nMittrabinda to Dwarka, and married her there. Listen with attention, and I\nwill now mention, how he brought away Sutya. In the Kuosul country, there was\na Raja, named Nugnujjit, who had a daughter, named Sutya. When she was of a\nmarriageable age, the Raja procured seven huge, terrible bulls without strings\nin their noses: and let them loose in the country, making a vow, "That he\nwould marry his daughter to any person who should fasten strings in the noses\nof the seven at once."\n\nO great king! those seven bulls ranged about the country, bellowing and pawing\nthe ground with their heads down and tails raised, and killed whomsoever they\nmet. Hearing of this circumstance, Shree Krishnu Chund went, accompanied by\nUrjoon, and stood in the presence of the Raja Nugnujjit. On seeing him, the\nRaja descended from his throne, and prostrating\n\np. 268\n\nhimself so as to touch the ground with the eight principal parts of his body,\nseated Krishnu upon his throne; and placing sandal, unbroken rice and flowers\non his head, offering perfumes, lamps and consecrated food, said, in a most\nsupplicating manner, with joined hands and bended head, "My good fortune to-\nday is very great, that Krishnu, the lord of Shivu and Bruhmu, has come to my\nhouse." He went on to say, "O great king! I have made a certain compact, which\nis difficult of accomplishment; but I am now certain, that, through your\nfavour, it will be speedily accomplished." Krishnu said, "Tell me, what vow\nyou have made so difficult of fulfilment?" The Raja replied, "O lord of\ncompassion! I have let loose seven bulls without strings in their noses: and\nmade this compact, that I will marry my daughter to any person who shall put\nstrings in the noses of the seven at once,"\n\nShree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great king! Huri, having heard this, fastened his\ngirdle; and, having assumed seven different forms, went and stood where the\nbulls were; no one saw what was done invisibly, and Krishnu put strings in the\nnoses of the seven at once: The bulls stood as quietly as wooden bulls, whilst\nthe strings were being fastened in their noses; and when this was done,\nKrishnu led them all, with one rope, to the court of the Raja. When the\ninhabitants of the city beheld this exploit, they were all, both male and\nfemale, astonished, and began to pour forth loud exclamations of praise. The\nRaja Nugnujjit then sent for the family priest, and gave his daughter in\nmarriage according to the prescribed injunctions of the Vedas. Her dowry\nconsisted of ten thousand cows, nine lakhs of elephants, ten lakhs of horses,\nseventy-three lakhs of chariots, and male and female servants without number.\nWhen Shree Krishnu Chund departed thence, taking the dowry with him, the Rajas\nof the country were greatly enraged; and came and surrounded him on his way\nback. Urjoon destroyed and put them to flight, with arrows; and Huri returned\nwith them all to Dwarka,\n\np. 269\n\nhappy and rejoicing. The inhabitants of the city, coming out to meet him, and\nspreading silken cloths, brought Krishnu, in musical procession, to the royal\npalace, and were amazed at seeing the dowry. The people extolled Nugnujjit,\nand said, This is a great alliance. The Raja of Kuosul has done well in\nmarrying his daughter to Krishnu, and giving such a large dowry."\n\nO great king! the inhabitants of the city discoursed thus amongst themselves,\nwhen Shree Krishnu Chund and Bulram arrived there; and gave all Raja\nNugnujjit\'s dowry to Urjoon, and acquired a great reputation in the world by\nthe act.\n\nI will now mention the circumstances, attending the marriage of Shree Krishnu\nJee with Bhudra: listen attentively, and at your ease. Bhudra, the daughter of\nthe Raja of Kykye, chose a husband for herself, and wrote letters to all the\nneighbouring Rajas, who all came, and were assembled together. Shree Krishnu\nChund went also, accompanied by Urjoon, and stood in the court amongst the\nrest of the party. When the Raja\'s daughter, looking at and observing the\ndifferent chiefs with a garland in her hand, came to the sea of beauty, the\nlight of the world, Shree Krishnu Chund, she was fascinated, and threw the\ngarland upon his neck. When her mother and father saw this, they were\ndelighted, and married their daughter to Huri according to the Vedas;\nbestowing upon her an unbounded marriage portion.\n\nHaving recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great\nking! Shree Krishnu Chund having thus married Bhudra, I will now mention how\nhe married Luchmuna. When Luchmuna, the daughter of the very powerful and\nrenowned Raja of Bhudrades, was marriageable, she chose a husband for herself,\nand sent letters of invitation to the Rajas of all countries; who came with\ngreat pomp and splendour, with their armies arrayed and fully equipped; and\nsat down in the assembly in well arranged rows. Shree Krishnu Chund Jee went\nthere also, accompanied by Urjoon; and as\n\np. 270\n\nhe stood amongst the rest of the party, Luchmuna, having observed all who were\npresent, came and threw a garland on the neck of Krishnu. Her father married\nLuchmuna to him according to the Vedas. All the Rajas who had come there, were\ngreatly abashed; and said to one another, "Let us see whether Krishnu will\ntake away Luchmuna while we are here."\n\nHaving thus spoken, they all arranged their forces, and blocking up the road,\nstood ready for battle. As Shree Krishnu Chund and Urjoon advanced in the\nchariot with Luchmuna, they came and stopped them, and began to fight. At\nlength, after some time, Urjoon and Shree Krishnu destroyed, and put them all\nto flight with arrows; and reached the city of Dwarka, happy and rejoicing. On\ntheir arrival, there were songs of congratulation and rejoicing in every house\nthroughout the city, according to the injunctions of the Vedas.\n\nHaving proceeded thus far in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great\nking! in this manner Shree Krishnu Chund contracted five marriages, and lived\nhappily at Dwarka with his eight queens, who were in constant attendance upon\nhim. The queens\' names were Rohnee, Jamwutee, Sutbhama, Kalindee, Mittrabinda,\nSutya, Bhudra and Luchmuna.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LX](psa61.htm)\n\n'
