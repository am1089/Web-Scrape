Book III.\nCanto LVI.\n\n[408:2b](ry365.htm#fr_843) Prajapatis are the ten lords of created beings\nfirst created by Brahma; somewhat like the Demiurgi of the Gnostics.\n\n[408:3b](ry365.htm#fr_844) "This is the number of the Vedic divinities\nmentioned in the Rig-veda. In p. 409 Ashtaka I. Sukta XXXIV. the Rishi\nHiranyastupa invoking the As\'vins says: \xc3\x80 Nasatya tribhirekadasair iha\ndevebniryatam: "O Nasatyas (As\'vins) come hither with the thrice eleven Gods,"\nAnd in Sukta XLV. the Rishi Praskanva addressing his hymn to Agni (ignis,\nfire), thus invokes him: "Lord of the red steeds, propitiated by our prayers\nlead hither the thirty-three Gods." This number must certainly have been the\nactual number in the early days of the Vedic religion: although it appears\nprobable enough that the thirty-three Vedic divinities could not then be found\nco-ordinated in so systematic a way as they were arranged more recently by the\nauthors of the Upanishads. In the later ages of Bramanism the number went on\nincreasing without measure by successive mythical and religious creations\nwhich peopled the Indian Olympus with abstract beings of every kind. But\nthrough lasting veneration of the word of tha Veda the custom regained of\ngiving the name of "the thirty-three Gods" to the immense phalanx of the\nmultiplied deities."
