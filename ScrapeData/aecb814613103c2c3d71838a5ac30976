He was not a man possessed of a scholarlike knowledge of\nthe ancient system of the Vedanta-philosophy, nor do I feel certain that even\nKeshub Chunder Sen had studied Sa _m_ kara's\n\np. 70\n\nor Ramanu _g_ a's famous commentaries on the Vedanta Sutras. But both were\nthoroughly imbued with the spirit of that philosophy, which is, in fact, like\nthe air breathed more or less by every Hindu who cares for philosophy or\nreligion. It is difficult to say whether we should treat the Vedanta as\nphilosophy or religion, the two being really inseparable from the Hindu point\nof view.\n\nWhat is curious, however, both in Keshub Chunder Sen's and in Ramak _ri_ sh\n_n_ a's utterances, is the admixture of European ideas. Neither the one nor\nthe other would have spoken as they did, before the English Government began\nits educational work in India. The bulk of their teaching is, no doubt, Indian\nto the backbone. It is the old Indian philosophy, properly called Vedanta or\nthe highest goal of the Veda, but there is clearly a sprinkling, and sometimes\nfar more than a mere sprinkling, of European thoughts in Keshub's writings;\nand we often meet with quite unexpected references to European subjects, not\nexcluding railways and gas, in the sayings of Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a.\n\nIt is necessary to explain in a few words the character of that Vedanta-\nphilosophy which is the very marrow running through all the bones of Ramak\n_ri_ sh _n_ a's doctrine. It is by no means easy, however, to give a short\nabstract of that ancient philosophy, particularly if we consider that it\nexists now, and seems always to have existed, under three different forms, the\nAdvaita School (non-duality school), the Vi _s_ ish _t_ a-advaita School (non-\nduality school, with a difference), and the Dvaita School (real duality\nschool), the last of which seems hardly to have a right to the name\n\np. 71\n\nof Vedanta, but nevertheless is so called. The Advaita or non-duality school,\nchiefly represented by Sa _m_ kara and his followers, holds that there is and\nthere can be one reality only, whether we call it God, the Infinite or the\nAbsolute, the Unknowable or Brahman, so that it follows by the strictest rules\nof logic that whatever is or seems to be, can be that one Absolute only,\nthough wrongly conceived, as we are told, by Avidya or Nescience. The human\nsoul, like everything else, is and can be nothing but Brahman or the Absolute,\nthough for a time misconceived by Avidya or Nescience. The desire of each\nindividual soul is not, as commonly supposed, an approach to or a union with\nBrahman, but simply a becoming what it has always been, a recovering and\nrecollection of its true being, a recognition of the full and undivided\nBrahman as the eternal basis of every apparently individual soul.\n\nThe second school, called Vi _s_ ish _t_ a-advaita, or Advaita, non-duality,\nwith a difference, was evidently intended for a larger public, for those who\ncould not bring themselves to deny all reality to the phenomenal world, and\nsome individuality likewise to their own souls. It is difficult to say which\nof the two schools was the more ancient, and I am bound to acknowledge, after\nProfessor Thibaut's luminous exposition, that the Vi _s_ ish _t_ advaita\ninterpretation seems to me more in keeping with the Sutras of Badaraya _n_ a.\nIt is true that Ramanu _g_ a lived in the twelfth, Sa _m_ kara in the eighth\ncentury, but there were Vi _s_ ish _t_ advaita expositions and commentaries\nlong before Ramanu _g_ a. Considered as a case of philosophical athletics, the\nrigidly\n\np. 72\n\nmonistic school cannot fail to command our admiration. Sa _m_ kara makes no\nconcessions of any kind. He begins and never parts with his conviction that\nwhatever is, is one and the same in itself, without variableness or shadow of\nturning. This, what he calls the Brahman, does not possess any qualities (vi\n_s_ esha), not even those of being and thinking, but it is both being and\nthought. To every attempt to define or qualify Brahman, Sa _m_ kara has but\none answer--No, No! When the question is asked as to the cause of what cannot\nbe denied, namely, the manifold phenomenal world, or the world as reflected in\nour consciousness, with all its individual subjects, and all its individual\nobjects, all that Sa _m_ kara condescends to say is that their cause is Avidya\nor Nescience. Here lies what strikes a Western mind as the vulnerable point of\nSa _m_ kara's Vedanta-philosophy. We should feel inclined to say that even\nthis Avidya, which causes the phenomenal world to appear, must itself have\nsome cause and reality, but Sa _m_ kara does not allow this, and repeats again\nand again that, as an illusion, Nescience is neither real nor unreal, but is\nsomething exactly like our own ignorance when, for instance, we imagine we see\na serpent, while what we really see is a rope, and yet we run away from it in\nall earnestness as if it were a real cobra. This creative Nescience once\ngranted, everything else proceeds smoothly enough. Brahman (or \xc3\x82tman), as held\nor as beheld by Avidya, seems modified into all that is phenomenal. Our\ninstruments of knowledge, whether senses or mind, nay, our whole body, should\nbe considered as impediments or fetters rather, as\n\np. 73\n\nUpadhis, as they are called, which one feels tempted to translate by\nimpositions. And here the difficulty arises--are these Upadhis, these\nmisleading organs of knowledge, the cause or the result of Avidya? With us\nthey are clearly the cause of Avidya; but are they not, like everything that\nwe call created, the result also of that universal beginning-less Avidya,\nwithout which Brahman could never have become even phenomenally creative? This\nis a point that requires further consideration. It is touched upon, but hardly\ndecided, by Sa _m_ kara in his commentary (pp. 787, 789), where we read 1:\n'The omniscience and omnipotence of the \xc3\x82tman are hidden by its union with the\nbody, that is, by the union with the body, senses, Manas (mind), and Buddhi\n(thought), the objects, and their perception as such.' And here we have the\nsimile: As fire is endowed with burning and light, but both are hidden when\nfire has retired into the wood or is covered with ashes, in the same manner,\nthrough the union of the Self with the Upadhis, such as body, senses, &c.,\nthat is, with the Upadhis formed by Avidya from Namarupa, names and forms,\nthere arises the error of the \xc3\x82tman not being different from them, and this is\nwhat causes the hiding of the omniscience and omnipotence of the \xc3\x82tman. It is\nunder the influence of that Avidya that Brahman assumes or receives names and\nforms (namarupa), which come very near to the Greek \xce\xbb\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xb3\xce\xbf\xce\xb9, or the archetypes\nof everything. Then follow the material objective elements which constitute\nanimate and inanimate bodies, in fact the whole objective world. But all this\nis illusive. In reality there\n\np. 74\n\nare no individual things, no individual souls ( _g_ ivas); they only seem to\nexist so long as Nescience prevails over \xc3\x82tman or Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[73:1](rls20.htm#fr_9) Deussen, System des Vedanta, p. 115.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Ekam advitiyam.
