Kuns continued to rule tyrannically in Muttra, and\nOogursen to be afflicted with many griefs--When Dewukee, the daughter of\nDewuk, Kuns\' uncle, was fit for marriage, Dewuk went to Kuns, and asked him to\nwhom she should be given in marriage; he replied, give her to Basoodeo, the\nson of Soorsen. On hearing this, Dewuk having sent for a Brahmin, and having\nfixed upon a fortunate time, sent the nuptial gifts to Soorsen\'s house; and\nSoorsen also having formed a marriage procession with great splendour, and\ntaking with him Rajas of all countries, came to Basoodeo\'s marriage. Having\nheard of the arrival of the marriage procession near the city, Oogursen, Dewuk\nand Kuns, taking their armies with them; and advancing to meet it brought the\nprocession with them into the city. Having advanced to meet the bridegroom\nwith the greatest respect, they appointed a place in the bride\'s house for the\nreception of him and his attendants; having entertained all who composed the\nmarriage procession, they seated them in a hall, erected for the occasion, and\nadorned with flowers; and Kuns gave away Dewukee to Basoodeo in the manner\nprescribed by the Vedas, and bestowed a dowry of fifteen thousand horses, four\nthousand elephants, eighteen hundred ruths or cars, numerous male and female\nservants, and golden dishes, or trays filled with dresses ornamented with\njewels without number; and Kuns gave jewelled dresses also to all who composed\nthe\n\np. 14\n\nmarriage procession. After this, all assembled to escort the procession to\nBasoodeo\'s house, upon which there was a voice from heaven, saying, "O Kuns,\nthe eighth son of her whom you are escorting shall be your destruction, you\nshall die by his hand."\n\nOn hearing this, Kuns trembled with fear, and being enraged, seizing Dewukee\nby the hair, he dragged her from her ruth: snatching a sword, he began to say,\ngnashing his teeth, "The tree which is plucked up by the roots will not\nproduce blossoms and fruits; I will now put her to death, and reign without\nfear."\n\nOn hearing and seeing what had happened, Basoodeo began to say to himself,\n"This fool has given pain, he does not distinguish between good and evil; if I\nshould show rage now, the business in hand would be ruined; wherefore, it is\nbetter in the present instance to forgive; it is said, that, \'when an enemy\ndraws a sword, a virtuous man will strive to soothe him; the fool on coming to\nhis senses will regret his conduct, just as fire is put out by water.\'"\n\nReflecting thus, Basoodeo went into the presence of Kuns, and joining his\nhands in a supplicating manner, and speaking submissively began to say, "O\nlord of the earth! there is no one in the world so powerful as you, and all\nmen live under your shadow; being so great a hero, it is very improper that\nyou should raise your sword against a woman, and it is a great crime to kill a\nsister--men will be guilty of injustice, if they know that they will never\ndie: this is the custom of the world, we are born in one place, and die in\nanother: a man may cherish his body by doing good or evil in ten million\ndifferent ways, but his body will never be at his own disposal: wealth,\npoverty, royal power will be of no use; for this reason, be pleased to listen\nto what I say, and release your poor, weak sister."\n\nOn hearing this, Kuns, looking upon his sister as the instrument of his death,\nwas alarmed, and became more enraged.\n\np. 15\n\n[paragraph continues] Upon this Basoodeo thought within himself, "This sinner,\nwith the mind of a devil, is obstinately determined to follow out his own\nplans; we must take measures, by which Dewukee may be rescued from his hands."\nReflecting thus, he began to say to himself, "I will save Dewukee by saying to\nKuns, that I will give him every son of her\'s, that is born; who has seen the\nfuture, there may not be a child, or this devil may die? The present crisis is\nbefore us, we can take measures for the future hereafter."\n\nHaving resolved upon this, Basoodeo said to Kuns, "O great king! your death\nshall not be caused by the hand of any son of her\'s, because I have determined\nthat I will bring and deliver over to you all the sons she, Dewukee, may have:\nthis I promise you." When Basoodeo had thus spoken, Kuns consented to what he\nhad proposed, and releasing Dewukee, began to say, "O Basoodeo! you have\nthought well in saving me from the commission of so great a crime;" saying\nthis, Kuns dismissed him, and himself returned home.\n\nAfter dwelling some days in Muttra, when Dewukee had her first son, Basoodeo\ntook it, and weeping placed it before Kuns; on seeing the infant, Kuns\nexclaimed, "Basoodeo! you are very true to your word; I have had reason to\nknow this to-day, because you have not deceived me; sacrificing all your\naffections, you have brought and given your child to me, I have no fear from\nit; I therefore give the child back to you." Hearing this, Basoodeo took the\nchild, and making a salutation to Kuns, returned home.\n\nAnd at that time Narud Jee, the sage, went to Kuns and said, "Raja! why have\nyou given the infant back? Do you not know that all the gods have been born,\nand come to Bruj to serve Basoodeo; and in the eighth pregnancy of Dewukee,\nShree Krishnu being born, and having put all devils to death, will remove all\nthe burthens of the world?" Saying this, Narud Jee drew eight lines, and\ncounted them: when in eight countings, each in turn was the eighth, Kuns\n\np. 16\n\nbeing alarmed sent for Basoodeo and the child. Narud, the sage, departed,\nafter having thus informed Kuns, who took the infant from Basoodeo, and put it\nto death.--In this manlier, whenever a son was born, Basoodeo brought it to\nKuns, and he destroyed it. Six infants were thus killed, when Shree Bhugwan,\nin the form of the great serpent, Shesh, took up his abode in the seventh\npregnancy.\n\nOn the hearing this, the Raja Pureechit said to Shookdeo the sage, "O great\nking! give me some account of Narud, the sage, who was the cause of so many\ncrimes being committed, in order that the doubts of my mind may disappear."\nShree Shookdeo replied, "Raja! Narud Jee thought rightly, that Kuns would\ncommit very many crimes, in consequence of which Shree Bhugwan would speedily\nappear upon the earth."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter III](psa04.htm)\n\n'
