It is not\nundeserving of notice, as it expresses the opinion which native writers\nentertain of the scope of the Puran\xcc\x81as, and of their recognising the\nsubservience of these works to the dissemination of sectarian principles..\nThus it is said in the Uttara Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a of the Padma, that the Puran\xcc\x81as, as\nwell as other works, are divided into three classes, according to the\nqualities which prevail in them. Thus the Vishn\xcc\x81u, Naradiya, Bhagavata,\nGarud\xcc\x81a, Padma, and Varaha Puran\xcc\x81as, are Satwika, or pure, from the\npredominance in them of the Satwa quality, or that of goodness and purity.\nThey are, in fact, Vaishn\xcc\x81ava Puran\xcc\x81as. The Matsya, Kurma, Linga, \xc5\x9aiva,\nSkanda, and Agni Puran\xcc\x81as, are Tamasa, or Puran\xcc\x81as of darkness, from the\nprevalence of the quality of Tamas, 'ignorance,' 'gloom.' They are\nindisputably \xc5\x9aaiva Puran\xcc\x81as. The third series, comprising the Brahman\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a,\nBrahma-vaivartta, Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya, Bhavishya, Vamana, and Brahma Puran\xcc\x81as, are\ndesignated as Rajasa, 'passionate,' from Rajas, the property of passion, which\nthey are supposed to represent.. The Matsya does not specify which are the\nPuran\xcc\x81as that come under these designations, but remarks that those in which\nthe Mahatmya of Hari or Vishn\xcc\x81u prevails are Satwika; those in which the\nlegends of Agni or \xc5\x9aiva predominate are Tamasa; and those which dwell most on\nthe stories of Brahma are Rajasa. I have elsewhere stated 25, that I\nconsidered the Rajasa Puran\xcc\x81as to lean to the Sakta division of the Hindus,\nthe worshippers of \xc5\x9aakti, or the female principle; founding this opinion\n\np. xiii\n\non the character of the legends which some of them contain, such as the Durga\nMahatmya, or celebrated legend on which the worship of Durga or Kali is\nespecially founded, which is a principal episode of the Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya. The\nBrahma-vaivartta also devotes the greatest portion of its chapters to the\ncelebration of Radha, the mistress of Krishn\xcc\x81a, and other female divinities.\nCol. Vans Kennedy, however, objects to the application of the term Sakta to\nthis last division of the Puran\xcc\x81as, the worship of \xc5\x9aakti being the especial\nobject of a different class of works, the Tantras, and no such form of worship\nbeing particularly inculcated in the Brahma Puran\xcc\x81a 26. This last argument is\nof weight in regard to the particular instance specified, and the designation\nof \xc5\x9aakti may not be correctly applicable to the whole class, although it is to\nsome of the series; for there is no incompatibility in the advocacy of a\nTantrika modification of the Hindu religion by any Puran\xcc\x81a, and it has\nunquestionably been practised in works known as Upa-puran\xcc\x81as. The proper\nappropriation of the third class of the Puran\xcc\x81as, according to the Padma\nPuran\xcc\x81a, appears to be to the worship of Krishn\xcc\x81a, not in the character in\nwhich he is represented in the Vishn\xcc\x81u and Bhagavata Puran\xcc\x81as, in which the\nincidents of his boyhood are only a portion of his biography, and in which the\nhuman character largely participates, at least in his riper years, but as the\ninfant Krishn\xcc\x81a, Govinda, Bala Gopala, the sojourner in Vrindavan, the\ncompanion of the cowherds and milkmaids, the lover of Radha, or as the\njuvenile master of the universe, Jagannatha. The term Rajasa, implying the\nanimation of passion, and enjoyment of sensual delights, is applicable, not\nonly to the character of the youthful divinity, but to those with whom his\nadoration in these forms seems to have originated, the Gosains of Gokul and\nBengal, the followers and descendants of Vallabha and Chaitanya, the priests\nand proprietors of Jagannath and \xc5\x9arinath-dwar, who lead a life of affluence\nand indulgence, and vindicate, both by precept and practice, the\nreasonableness of the Rajasa property, and the congruity of temporal enjoyment\nwith the duties of religion 27.\n\nThe Puran\xcc\x81as are uniformly stated to be eighteen in number. It is said that\nthere are also eighteen Upa-puran\xcc\x81as, or minor Puran\xcc\x81as; but\n\np. xiv\n\nthe names of only a few of these are specified in the least exceptionable\nauthorities, and the greater number of the works is not procurable. With\nregard to the eighteen Puran\xcc\x81as, there is a peculiarity in their\nspecification, which is proof of an interference with the integrity of the\ntext, in some of them at least; for each of them specifies the names of the\nwhole eighteen. Now the list could not have been complete whilst the work that\ngives it was unfinished, and in one only therefore, the last of the series,\nhave we a right to look for it. As however there are more last words than one,\nit is evident that the names must have been inserted in all except one after\nthe whole were completed: which of the eighteen is the exception, and truly\nthe last, there is no clue to discover, and the specification is probably an\ninterpolation in most, if not in all.\n\nThe names that are specified are commonly the same, and are as follows: 1.\nBrahma, 2. Padma, 3. Vaishn\xcc\x81ava, 4. \xc5\x9aaiva, 5. Bhagavata, 6. Narada, 7.\nMarkan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, 8. \xc3\x81gneya, 9. Bhavishya, 10. Brahma-vaivartta, 11. Lainga, 12.\nVaraha, 13. Skanda, 14. Vamana, 15. Kaurma, 16. Matsya, 17. Garud\xcc\x81a, 18.\nBrahman\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a 28. This is from the twelfth book of the Bhagavata, and is the\nsame as occurs in the Vishn\xcc\x81u 29. In other authorities there are a few\nvariations. The list of the K.urma P. omits the Agni Puran\xcc\x81a, and substitutes\nthe Vayu. The Agni leaves out the \xc5\x9aaiva, and inserts the Vayu. The Varaha\nomits the Garud\xcc\x81a and Brahman\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, and inserts the Vayu and Narasinha: in this\nlast it is singular. The Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya agrees with the Vishn\xcc\x81u and Bhagavata in\nomitting the Vayu. The Matsya, like the Agni, leaves out the \xc5\x9aaiva.\n\nSome of the Puran\xcc\x81as, as the Agni, Matsya, Bhagavata, and Padma, also\nparticularize the number of stanzas which each of the eighteen contains. In\none or two instances they disagree, but in general they concur. The aggregate\nis stated at 400,000 slokas, or 1,600,000 lines. These are\n\np. xv\n\nfabled to be but an abridgment, the whole amount being a krore, or ten\nmillions of stanzas, or even a thousand millions. If all the fragmentary\nportions claiming in various parts of India to belong to the Puran\xcc\x81as were\nadmitted, their extent would much exceed the lesser, though it would not reach\nthe larger enumeration. The former is, however, as I have elsewhere stated 30,\na quantity that an individual European scholar could scarcely expect to peruse\nwith due care and attention, unless his whole time were devoted exclusively\nfor many years to the task. Yet without some such labour being achieved, it\nwas clear, from the crudity and inexactness of all that had been hitherto\npublished on the subject, with one exception 31, that sound views on the\nsubject of Hindu mythology and tradition were not to be expected.\nCircumstances, which I have already explained in the paper in the Journal of\nthe Royal Asiatic Society referred to above, enabled me to avail myself of\ncompetent assistance, by which I made a minute abstract of most of the\nPuran\xcc\x81as. In course of time I hope to place a tolerably copious and connected\nanalysis of the whole eighteen before Oriental scholars, and in the mean while\noffer a brief notice of their several contents.\n\nIn general the enumeration of the Puran\xcc\x81as is a simple nomenclature, with the\naddition in some cases of the number of verses; but to these the Matsya\nPuran\xcc\x81a joins the mention of one or two circumstances peculiar to each, which,\nalthough scanty, are of value, as offering means of identifying the copies of\nthe Puran\xcc\x81as now found with those to which the Matsya refers, or of\ndiscovering a difference between the present and the past. I shall therefore\nprefix the passage descriptive of each Puran\xcc\x81a from the Matsya. It is\nnecessary to remark, however, that in the comparison instituted between that\ndescription and the Puran\xcc\x81a as it exists, I necessarily refer to the copy or\ncopies which I employed for the purpose of examination and analysis, and which\nwere procured with some trouble and cost in Benares and Calcutta. In some\ninstances my manuscripts\n\np. xvi\n\nhave been collated with others from different parts of India, and the result\nhas shewn, that, with regard at least to the Brahma, Vishn\xcc\x81u, Vayu, Matsya,\nPadma, Bhagavata, and Kurma Puran\xcc\x81as, the same works, in all essential\nrespects, are generally current under the same appellations. Whether this is\ninvariably the case may be doubted, and farther inquiry may possibly shew that\nI have been obliged to content myself with mutilated or unauthentic works 32.\nIt is with this reservation, therefore, that I must be understood to speak of\nthe concurrence or disagreement of any Puran\xcc\x81a with the notice of it which the\nMatsya P. has preserved.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xii:25](vp004.htm#fr_24) As.

Thus Vaishn\xcc\x81avam Puran\xcc\x81am means the\nPuran\xcc\x81a of Vishn\xcc\x81u; \xc5\x9aaivam Puran\xcc\x81am, the P. of \xc5\x9aiva; Brahmam Puran\xcc\x81am, the P.\nof Brahma. It is equally correct, and more common, to use the two substantives\np. xv in apposition, as Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a, \xc5\x9aiva Puran\xcc\x81a, &c. In the original\nSanscrit the nouns are compounded, as Vishn\xcc\x81u-puran\xcc\x81am, &c.; but it has not\nbeen customary to combine them in their European shape.\n\n[xiv:29](vp004.htm#fr_28) P.

However much I may differ\nfrom that learned and industrious writer's conclusions, I must do him the\njustice to admit that he is the only author who has discussed the subject of\nthe mythology of the Hindus on right principles, by drawing his materials from\nauthentic sources.\n\n[xvi:32](vp004.htm#fr_31) Upon examining the translations of different\npassages from the Puran\xcc\x81as, given by Col. Vans Kennedy in the work mentioned\nin a former note, and comparing them with the text of the manuscripts I have\nconsulted, I find such an agreement as to warrant the belief that there is no\nessential difference between the copies in his possession and in mine. The\nvarieties which occur in the MSS. of the East India Company's Library will be\nnoticed in the text.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 1. The Brahma Puran\xcc\x81a](vp005.htm)\n\n"
