Take\nthe judgment 'This is such and such'; how can we realise here the non-\ndifference of 'being this' and 'being such and such'? The 'such and such'\ndenotes a peculiar make characterised, e.g. by a dewlap, the 'this' denotes\nthe thing distinguished by that peculiar make; the non-difference of these two\nis thus contradicted by immediate consciousness. At the outset the thing\nperceived is perceived as separate from all other things, and this separation\nis founded on the fact that the thing is distinguished by a special\nconstitution, let us say the generic characteristics of a cow, expressed by\nthe term 'such and such.' In general, wherever we cognise the relation of\ndistinguishing attribute and thing distinguished\n\np. 43\n\nthereby, the two clearly present themselves to our mind as absolutely\ndifferent. Somethings--e.g. staffs and bracelets--appear sometimes as having a\nseparate, independent existence of their own; at other times they present\nthemselves as distinguishing attributes of other things or beings (i.e. of the\npersons carrying staffs or wearing bracelets). Other entities--e.g. the\ngeneric character of cows--have a being only in so far as they constitute the\nform of substances, and thus always present themselves as distinguishing\nattributes of those substances. In both cases there is the same relation of\ndistinguishing attribute and thing distinguished thereby, and these two are\napprehended as absolutely different. The difference between the two classes of\nentities is only that staffs, bracelets, and similar things are capable of\nbeing apprehended in separation from other things, while the generic\ncharacteristics of a species are absolutely incapable thereof. The assertion,\ntherefore, that the difference of things is refuted by immediate\nconsciousness, is based on the plain denial of a certain form of\nconsciousness, the one namely--admitted by every one--which is expressed in\nthe judgment 'This thing is such and such.'--This same point is clearly\nexpounded by the Sutrakara in II, 2, 33.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Inference also teaches difference](sbe48013.htm)\n\n"
