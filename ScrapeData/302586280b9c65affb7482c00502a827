On adisade _s_ e the commentary says, adisade _s_ e\nadisamipaprade _s_ e prathame t _ri_ tiyabhage, ity etat. adimade _s_ a iti pa\n_th_ e vyakta evartha _h_. To me it seems probable that adimade _s_ e is the\ntrue reading.\n\n[52:7](sbe30018.htm#fr_222) The first Mantra consists of seven sections; with\neach of p. 53 these sections he should, according to the commentary, give\nthree barley corns or beans to the owner of the Nyagrodha tree, or put them\ndown at the root of the tree.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 7](sbe30019.htm)\n\n"
