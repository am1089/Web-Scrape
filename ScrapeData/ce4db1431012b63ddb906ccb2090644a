Now, man here, indeed,\nis possessed of understanding 1, and according to how great his understanding\nis when he departs this world, so does he, on passing away, enter yonder\nworld.\n\n10:6:3:22\\. Let him meditate on the Self, which is made up of intelligence,\nand endowed with a body of spirit, with a form of light, and with an etherial\nnature, which changes its shape at will, is swift as thought, of true resolve,\nand true purpose, which consists of all sweet odours and tastes, which holds\nsway over all the regions and pervades this whole universe, which is\nspeechless and indifferent 2;even as a grain of rice, or a grain of barley, or\na grain of millet, or the smallest granule of millet, so is this golden 3\nPurusha in the heart; even as a smokeless light, it is greater than the sky,\ngreater than the ether, greater than the earth, greater than all existing\nthings;--that self of the spirit (breath) is my self: on passing away from\nhence I shall obtain that self. Verily, whosoever has this trust 4, for him\nthere is no uncertainty. Thus spake Sa _n_ _d_ ilya, and so it is 5.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[400:1](sbe4373.htm#fr_824) Or, will, purpose,--kratumaya _h_ , kratur ni _s_\n_k_ ayo\xe0\xa4\xbddhyavasaya evam eva nanyathety avivakshitapratyaya _h_ , tadatmako\xe0\xa4\xbdya\n_m_ purusho _g_ iva _h_.
