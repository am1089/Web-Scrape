(The rite of carrying fire on the head is an attribute) of the study of\nthe Veda (of the \xc3\x82tharva _n_ ikas); because in the Sama _k_ ara (it is\nmentioned) as being such. (This also follows) from the general subject-matter,\nand the limitation (of the rite to the \xc3\x82tharva _n_ ikas) is analogous to that\nof the libations,\n\nWith reference to the purvapakshin's averment that the rite of carrying fire\non the head is connected with the vidya of the followers of the Atharva-veda\nonly, not with any other vidya, and that thereby the vidya of the \xc3\x82tharva _n_\nikas is separated from all other vidyas, the following remarks have to be\nmade.--The rite of carrying fire on the head is an attribute not of the vidya,\nbut merely of the study of the Veda on the part of the \xc3\x82tharva _n_ ikas. This\nwe infer from the circumstance that the \xc3\x82tharva _n_ ikas, in the book called\n'Sama _k_ ara' which treats of Vedic observances, record the above rite also\nas being of such a nature, i.e. as constituting an attribute of the study of\nthe Veda. At the close of the Upanishad moreover we have the following\nsentence, 'A\n\np. 190\n\nman who has not performed the rites does not read this;' here we conclude from\nthe word 'this' which refers to the subject previously treated, and from the\nfact of 'reading' being mentioned, that the rite is an attribute of the study\nof the Upanishad of the \xc3\x82tharva _n_ ikas (but has nothing to do with the\nUpanishad itself).--But what about the immediately preceding passage, 'Let a\nman tell this science of Brahman to those only by whom the rite of carrying\nfire on the head has been performed according to rule?' Here the rite in\nquestion is connected with the science of Brahman, and as all science of\nBrahman is one only, it follows that the rite has to be connected with all\nscience of Brahman!--Not so, we reply; for in the above passage also the word\n'this' refers back to what forms the subject of the antecedent part of the\nUpanishad, and that subject is constituted by the science of Brahman only in\nso far as depending on a particular book (viz. the Mu _n_ _d_ aka-Upanishad);\nhence the rite also is connected with that particular book only.--The Sutra\nadds another illustrative instance in the words 'and as in the case of the\nlibations there is limitation of that.' As the seven libations--from the\nsaurya libation up to the _s_ ataudana libation--since they are not connected\nwith the triad of fires taught in the other Vedas, but only with the one fire\nwhich is taught in the Atharvan, are thereby enjoined exclusively on the\nfollowers of the Atharvan; so the rite of carrying fire on the head also is\nlimited to the study of that particular Veda with which scriptural statements\nconnect it.--The doctrine of the unity of the vidyas thus remains unshaken.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 4](sbe38147.htm)\n\n"
