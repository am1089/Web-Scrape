Naraya _n_ a said :-- If one divides or separates the padas while\nreciting or making Japam of the Gayatri, one is freed from the Brahmi _n_\nicide, the sin of Brahmahatya. But if one does so without breaking the padas,\ni.e., repeats at one breath, then one incurs the sin of Brahmahatya. Those\nBrahma _n_ as who do the Japam of the Gayatri without giving due pause to the\npadas, suffer pains in hells with their heads downwards for one hundred\nKalpas. O Gayatri! Thou art of one foot, of two feet, of three feet and of\nfour feet. Thou art without foot, because Thou art not obtained. Salutation to\nThy Fourth Foot beautiful and which is above the Triloki (Rajas). This cannot\nobtain that. Firstly, Gayatri is of three kinds :-- \xc2\x93Sampu _t_ a,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93Ekomkara,\xc2\x94\nand \xc2\x93Sa _d_ omkara.\xc2\x94 There is also the Gayatri, with five Pra _n_ avas,\naccording to the Dharma S\xc2\x92astras and Pura _n_ as. There is something to be\nnoted while muttering or making the japam of the Gayatri :-- Note how many\nlettered Gayatri you are going to repeat (make japam). When you have repeated\none-eighth of that, repeat (make japam) the Turiya pada of Gayatri (i.e., the\nfourth Pada, the mantram parorajase Savadoma prapat) etc., (see the daily\npractices, page 107) once and then complete repeating the Gayatri. If the\nBrahma _n_ a makes the Japam (the silent muttering) in the above way he gets\nhimself united with Brahma. Other modes of making the Japam do not bear any\nfruit. Om Gayatryasye kapadi dvipapi Tripadi chatus padasi nahi padyase\nnamaste Turyaya dars\xc2\x92atayapadaya paro Rajase Sabado ma prapat. Gayatri is one-\nfooted in the form of Triloki, two-footed, the Trayi Vidya from thy second\nfoot; tripadi (all Pra _n_ as are thy third foot, chatu _s_ padi, as the Puru\n_s_ a apadi without any foot, Parorajase above the Rajas, the dust; asau-that;\nadah this not prapat may obtain. The Yogis who are \xc3\x9brdharetas (hold Brahma\ncharyam, continence) are to make Japam of the Sampu _t_ a Gayatri (i.e., with\nOm). Gayatri with one pra _n_ ava and as well the Gayatri with six pra _n_\navas. The householder Brahmachari or those who want mok _s_ a are to make\nJapam of Gayatri with Om prefixed.\n\n\n\n6\\. Those householders who affix Om to the Gayatri do not get the increase of\ntheir families.\n\n\n\np. 1107\n\n\n\n7-8. The Turiya pada (foot) of Gayatri is the mantra \xc2\x93Parorajase Savodoma\nprapat.\xc2\x94 (Brihad. up. v.14.7). Salutation to Thy beautiful Fourth Foot which\nis above the Triloki (Rajas). This cannot obtain that. The presiding deity of\nthis mantra is Brahma. I am now speaking of the full Dhyanam (meditation) of\nthis Brahma so that the full fruit of the Japam (recitation) may be obtained.\nThere is a full blown lotus in the heart; its form is like the Moon, Sun, and\nthe Spark of Fire; i.e., of the nature of pra _n_ ava and nothing else. This\nis the seat of the inconceivable Brahma. Think thus. Now on that seat is\nseated well the steady constant subtle Light, the essence of Akas\xc2\x92a, the\neverlasting existence, intelligence and bliss, the Brahma. May He increase my\nhappiness (see page 107 the daily practice of the Hindus by R. B. Sris Chandra\nBasu, on the Invocation of the Gayatri).\n\n\n\nNote :-- Aum! Gayatryasyekapadi dvipadi, tripadi, chatu _s_ padasi, nahi\npadyase namaste turyaya dars\xc2\x92 ataya padaya parorajase, savado maprapat O\nGayatri! Thou art of one foot (in the farm of Triloki), of two feet (the Trayi\nvidya from Thy second foot) of three feet all Pra _n_ a, etc., are Thy third\nfoot and of four feet (as the Puru _s_ a). Thou art without foot because Thou\nart not obtained. Salutation to Thy beautiful fourth foot which is above the\nTriloki (Rajas). This cannot obtain that.\n\n\n\n9\\. Now I am speaking of the Mudra of the Turiya Gayatri :-- (1) Tris\xc2\x92ula, (2)\nYoni, (3) Surabhi, (4) Ak _s_ amala, (5) Linga, (6) Padma and (7) Mahamudra.\nThese seven Mudras are to be shewn.\n\n\n\n10-14. What is Sandhya, that is Gayatri; there is no difference whatsoever\nbetween the two. The two are one and the same. Both are of the nature of\nExistence, Intelligence and Bliss. The Brahma _n_ as would daily worship Her\nand bow down before Her with greatest devotion and reverence. After the\nDhyanam, first worship Her with five upacharas or offerings. Thus :--\n\n\n\nOm lam prithivyatmane gandham, arpayami namo nama _h_. Om Ham akas\xc2\x92atmane pu\n_s_ pam arpayami namo nama _h_. Om ram Vahnyatmane dipam arpayami namo nama\n_h_. Aum vam amritatmane naivedyam arpayami namo nama _h_. Om yam ram lam vam\nham pu _s_ panjalim arpayami namo nama _h_. Thus worshipping with five\nupacharas, you must shew Mudras to the Devi.\n\n\n\n15-16. Then meditate on the Form of the Gayatri mentally and slowly repeat the\nGayatri. Do not shake head, neck and while making japam, do not show your\nteeth. According to due rules repeat the Gayatri one hundred and eight times,\nor twenty-eight times. When unable, repeat ten times; not less than that.\n\n\n\np. 1108\n\n\n\n17-20. Then raise the Gayatri placed before on the heart (seat) by the mantra\n\xc2\x93Gayatrasyai kapadi Dvipadi, etc., and then bid farewell to Her after bowing\ndown to Her and repeating the mantra \xc2\x93Omuttame S\xc2\x92ikhare Devi bhumyam parvata\nmurdhani Brahma _n_ a ebhyobhya anuj\xc3\xb1ata Gachcha Devi yathasukham\xc2\x94 on the\nhighest top of the mountain summit in earth (i.e., on the Meru mountain)\ndwells the goddess Gayatri. Being pleased with Thy worshippers go back, O\nDevi! to Thy abode as it pleaseth Thee.\xc2\x94 (See page 110, The Daily Practices of\nthe Hindus.)\n\n\n\nThe wise men never mutter nor recite the Gayatri mantra within the water. For\nthe Mahar _s_ is say that the Gayatri is fire-faced (agnimukhi). After the\nfarewell shew again the following mudras :-- Surabhi J\xc3\xb1an, Surpa, Kurma, Yoni,\nPadma, Linga and Nirvana Mudras.\n\n\n\nThen address thus :-- \xc2\x93O Devi! O Thou who speakest pleasant to Kas\xc2\x92yapa! O\nGayatri! Whatever syllables I have missed to utter in making Japam, whatever\nvowels and consonants are incorrectly pronounced, I ask Thy pardon for all my\nabove faults.\xc2\x94 O Narada! Next one ought to give peace offerings to the Gayatri\nDevi.\n\n\n\n21-33. The Chchhanda of Gayatri Tarpa _n_ am (peace offerings to Gayatri) is\nGayatri; the Ri _s_ i is Vis\xc2\x92vamitra; Savita is the Devata; its application\n(Niyoga) is in the peace offerings.\n\n\n\n\xc2\x93Om Bhu _h_ rigvedapuru _s_ am tarpayami.\xc2\x94\n\n\xc2\x93Om Bhuva _h_ Yajurvedapuru _s_ am tarpayami.\xc2\x94\n\n\xc2\x93Om Svah Samaveda puru _s_ am tarpayami.\xc2\x94\n\n\xc2\x93Om Maha _h_ Atharvaveda puru _s_ am tarpayami.\xc2\x94\n\n\xc2\x93Om Jana _h_ Itihasapura _n_ a puru _s_ am tarpayami.\xc2\x94\n\n\xc2\x93Om Tapa _h_ Sarvagama puru _s_ am tarpayami.\xc2\x94\n\n\xc2\x93Om Satyam Satyaloka puru _s_ am tarpayami.\xc2\x94\n\n\xc2\x93Om Bhuh bhurloka puru _s_ am tarpayami.\xc2\x94\n\n\xc2\x93Om Bhuva _h_ bhuvoloka puru _s_ am tarpayami.\xc2\x94\n\n\xc2\x93Om Sva _h_ svarloka puru _s_ am tarpayami.\xc2\x94\n\n\xc2\x93Om Bhuh rekapadam Gayatrim tarpayami.\xc2\x94\n\n\xc2\x93Om Bhuvo dvitiyapadam Gayatrim tarpayami.\xc2\x94\n\n\xc2\x93Om Svastripadam Gayatrim tarpayami.\xc2\x94\n\n\xc2\x93Om Bhurbhuvah Svas\xc2\x92chatuspadam Gayatrim tarpayami.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nPronouncing these, offer the Tarpa _n_ ams. Next add the word Tarpayami to\neach of the following words \xc2\x93\xc3\x9b _s_ asim, Gayatrim, Savitrim, Sarasvatim\nVedamataram, Prithvim, Ajam, Kaus\xc2\x92ikim, Samkritim, Savajitim, etc.,\xc2\x94 and offer\nTarpa _n_ ams. After the Tarpa _n_ am is over, offer the peace-chantings,\n(S\xc2\x92antivari) repeating the following mantras.\n\n\n\np. 1109\n\n\n\n\xc2\x93Om Jata vedase sunavama romam, etc.\xc2\x94\n\n\xc2\x93Om Manastoka, etc.\xc2\x94\n\n\xc2\x93Om Tryamvakam Yajamahe, etc.\xc2\x94\n\n\xc2\x93Om Tachchhamyoh, etc.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nThen touch all the parts of your bodies, repeating the two mantra, \xc2\x93Om\natodeva, etc.\xc2\x94 And reciting the mantram \xc2\x93Svona Prithivi,\xc2\x94 bow down to the\nearth, after repeating one\xc2\x92s name, Gotra, etc.\n\n\n\n34-45. O Narada! Thus the rules of the morning Sandhya are prescribed. Doing\nworks so far, bid farewell to the above-mentioned Gayatri. Next finishing the\nAgnihotra Homa sacrifice, worship the five Devatas, S\xc2\x92iva, S\xc2\x92iva, Ganes\xc2\x92a,\nSurya and Vi _sn_ u. Worship by the Puru _s_ a Sukta mantra, or by Hrim\nmantra, or by Vyahriti mantra or by S\xc2\x92rischate Lak _s_ mis\xc2\x92cha, etc., place\nBhavani in the centre; Vi _sn_ u in the north east corner, S\xc2\x92iva in the south-\neast corner; Ganes\xc2\x92a in the south-west corner, and the Sun in the north-west\ncorner; and then worship them. While offering worship with the sixteen\nofferings, worship by repeating sixteen mantras. As there is no other act more\nmerit-giving than the worship of the Devi, so the Devi should first of all be\nworshipped. Then worship in due order the five Devatas placed in five\npositions. As the worship of the Devi is the chief object, so in the three\nSandhyas, the worship of the Sandhya Devi is approved of by the S\xc2\x92rutis. Never\nworship Vi _sn_ u with rice; Ganes\xc2\x92a with Tulasi leaves; the Devi Durga with\nDurba grass and S\xc2\x92iva with Ketaki flower. The under-mentioned flowers are\npleasing to the Devi :-- Mallika, Jati, Ku _t_ aja, Panasa, Palasa, Vakula,\nLodha, Karavira, S\xc2\x92i _n_ s\xc2\x92apa, Aparajita, Bandhuka, Vaka, Madanta,\nSindhuvara, Palas\xc2\x92a, Durbha, S\xc2\x92allaki, Madhavi, Arka, Mandara, Ketaki, Kar _n_\nikara, Kadamba, Lotus, Champaka, Yuthika, _T_ agara, etc.\n\n\n\n46-47. Offer incenses Guggul, Dhupa and the light of the Til oil and finish\nthe worship. Then repeat the principal (male) mantra (make Japam). Thus\nfinishing the work, study the Vedas in the second quarter of the next day; and\nin the third quarter of that day feed father, mother and other dependent\nrelatives, with money earned by one\xc2\x92s own self according to the traditions of\none\xc2\x92s family.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Seventeenth Chapter of the Eleventh Book on the description of\nSandhya and other daily practices in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 18](bk11ch18.htm)\n\n'
