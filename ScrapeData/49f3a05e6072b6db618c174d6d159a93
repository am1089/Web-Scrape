Thus also, on account of existence of the former qualities (as proved) by\nsuggestion, Badaraya _n_ a holds absence of contradiction.\n\nThe teacher Badaraya _n_ a is of opinion that even thus, i.e. although the\ntext declares the soul to have mere intelligence for its essential nature, all\nthe same the previously stated attributes, viz. freedom from all sin, and so\non, are not to be excluded. For the authority of a definite statement in the\nUpanishads proves them to exist ('That Self which is free fiom sin,' &c.); and\nof authorities of equal strength one cannot refute the other. Nor must you say\nthat the case is one of essential contradiction, and that hence we necessarily\nmust conclude that freedom from sin, and so on (do not belong to the true\nnature of the soul, but) are the mere figments of Nescience (from which the\nreleased soul is free). For as there is equal authority for both sides, why\nshould the contrary view not be held? (viz. that the soul is essentially free\nfrom sin, &c., and that the _k_ aitanya is non-essential.) For the principle\nis that where two statements rest on equal authority, that only which suffers\nfrom an intrinsic impossibility is to be interpreted in a different way (i.e.\ndifferent from what it means on the face of it), so as not to conflict with\nthe other. But while admitting this we deny that the text which describes the\nSelf as a mass of mere knowledge implies that the nature of the Self comprises\nnothing whatever but knowledge.--But what then is the purport of that text?--\nThe meaning is clear, we reply; the text teaches that the entire Self,\ndifferent from all that is non-sentient, is self-illumined, i.e. not even a\nsmall part of it depends for its illumination on something else. The fact,\nvouched for in this text, of the soul in its entirety being a mere mass of\nknowledge in no way conflicts with the fact, vouched for by other texts, of\nits\n\np. 762\n\npossessing qualities such as freedom from sin and so on, which inhere in it as\nthe subject of those qualities; not any more than the fact of the lump of salt\nbeing taste through and through--which fact is known through the sense of\ntaste--conflicts with the fact of its possessing such other qualities as\ncolour, hardness, and so on, which are known through the eye and the other\nsense-organs. The meaning of the entire text is as follows--just as the lump\nof salt has throughout one and the same taste, while other sapid things such\nas mangoes and other fruit have different tastes in their different parts,\nrind and so on; so the soul is throughout of the nature of knowledge or self-\nilluminedness.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'that which is like\nBrahman.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 8.
