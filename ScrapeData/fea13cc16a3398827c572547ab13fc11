When Nund Jee had finished\nconversing, Krishnu and Bulram, having made a sign to Akroor took him aside.\nTreating him with respect and dignity they enquired about the welfare and\naffairs of Muttra. "Are Basoodeo and Dewukee well? Has the enmity of the Raja\nfallen upon them? Our maternal uncle, Kuns, is a great sinner, who has\ndestroyed all the family of Judoo.\n\n"Some great disease of the family of Judoo must have been born upon the earth\nin bodily shape, which has distressed them severely. In truth, Basoodeo and\nDewukee suffer all their present affliction on our account; if they had not\nconcealed us, they would not have been subjected to so much misery." Again\nKrishnu said, "What did they say to you as you were starting? We shall remain\nindebted to them for ever. They will keep us in remembrance; and must be very\nwretched in their present misfortunes."\n\nAt these words Akroor Jee said, "O lord of beneficence! you know all things;\nwhy need I speak of the tyranny of Kuns, who has not friendship or affection\nfor any one? He is constantly thinking of putting Basoodeo and Dewukee to\ndeath: but they have hitherto escaped through their good\n\np. 137\n\nfortune. And since Narud Jee, the sage, came and explained to him all the\ncircumstances of your birth, he has subjected Basoodeo and Dewukee to very\npainful imprisonment with fetters and handcuffs. To-morrow, he will offer\nsacrifice to Muhadeo, and the bow has been placed upon the sacrifice. All\npeople will come as spectators; and he has sent me to invite you, saying, go\nand bring Bulram, Krishnu and Nund Rae, together with their presents, for the\nsacrifice. I have, therefore, come to bring you."\n\nWhen Akroor had thus spoken, Bulram and Krishnu went to Nund Rae and said,\n"Our uncle, Akroor, says, that Kuns has invited us, father. It is the\nsacrifice, in which the bow is introduced; let us take butter-milk, rams and\ngoats, as offerings. Come, accompanied by us all: the Raja Kuns says he will\nnot admit any excuse."\n\nWhen Shree Krishnu Chund had explained this matter to Nund Jee, Nund Rae sent\nfor a public crier, and had proclamation made throughout the whole city, that\nall should go with him together to Muthoora; as the Raja had invited them. On\nhearing the proclamation, all the inhabitants of Bruj came early in the\nmorning with presents; and Nund Jee having taken milk, curd, butter, rams,\ngoats and buffaloes, and having yoked oxen in carts, went in company with\nthem. And Krishnu and Buldeo were conveyed on a ruth, accompanied by their\ncompanions, the cowherds\' children.\n\nNund and Oopnund went in advance, Huldhur and Gobind behind all the rest.\n\nShree Shookdeo Jee said, O lord of the earth! having heard of Shree Krishnu\'s\nsudden departure, all the women of Bruj were in a state of great alarm and\nagitation, and came rushing forth from their houses in a state of confusion.\nThey came to Krishnu\'s ruth, with lamentations and trembling--and surrounding\nthe ruth on all sides, said, with joined hands, and in a supplicating manner,\n"Why are you leaving us, O lord of Bruj! We have sacrificed every thing for\nyou. The friendship\n\np. 138\n\nof a virtuous man never diminishes, but always endures, like the lines of the\nhand, and the friendship of a fool is unstable, like a wall of sand. What\nfault towards you have we committed, that you are leaving us?"\n\nHaving thus addressed Shree Krishnu Chund, the cowherdesses, looking at\nAkroor, said, "This Akroor is very cruel; he does not sympathize with our\npain. He is taking away him, by being separated from whom, for a second, we\nare widowed. Kroor is deceitful, and hard-hearted: who has wrongly given him\nthe name of Akroor, that is, not cruel? O perverse Akroor! void of all\nunderstanding, why do you destroy, with fire, us poor, weak creatures?"\n\nHaving uttered these harsh words, and laying aside all modesty and reflection,\nthey laid hold of Huri\'s ruth, and began to say, to each other, "The women of\nMuthoora are very playful, lively and possessed of beauty and many good\nqualities. Beharee will fall in love with them, and being under the influence\nof their agreeable and pleasing dispositions, will remain with them. Why\nshould he then think of us? The women of Muthoora are very fortunate, in\nhaving one so much loved to stay with them. What error has there been in our\nprayers and penance, that Shree Krishnu Chund is separated from us?" After\nthus conversing amongst themselves, they began to address Huri again, "Your\nname is lord of the cowherds, why do you not take us with you? How will the\nmoments pass away without you? You have become the shade of our eye-lids, our\nbosoms will burst; after having felt love for us, why do you absent yourself?\nYou are relentless and unkind, and have no affection." The women thus offered\ntheir supplications, and were filled with anxious thoughts, having fallen into\na sea of affliction, they remained gazing at Huri with unmoved gaze, like a\ndoe that has been charmed, or a red partridge fascinated by the moon. Tears\ngushed from their eyes, and their tresses were spread in disorder over their\nfaces.\n\np. 139\n\nShree Shookdeo, the sage, said, the state of the cowherdesses was such as I\nhave described; and the Ranee Jusodha, having embraced her son with affection,\nsaid to him in a very endearing manner, "Son! take provisions with you for as\nmany days as you will be absent; do not form an affection for any one there,\nand come back quickly to your own." On hearing these words, Krishnu descended\nfrom his ruth, and having entered into an explanation with them all, took\nleave; making a salutation, and receiving his mother\'s blessing, he ascended\nthe ruth again, and started on his journey. The cowherdesses and Jusodha were\ndeeply grieved, and shedding tears, continued to call out the name of Krishnu;\nwhilst Krishnu stood up in his ruth, and said to them, as he went along; Go to\nyour homes and be not at all anxious, I will return hither in four or five\ndays."\n\nWhilst he was thus speaking, and looking at them, when the ruth had gone some\ndistance, and there was so much dust, (literally, the dust was spread to the\nsky,) that the flag of the ruth could not be seen; being in despair, they\nfluttered like fish deprived of water, and fell fainting to the ground. After\nsome delay they recovered, and rose up and consoled themselves with the\nconfident hope of his return. Jusodha took all the cowherdesses back with her\nto Brindabun; and Shree Krishnu arrived with his companions at the banks of\nthe Jumna. The cowherds\' children drank water there; and Huri placed his ruth\nunder the shade of a fig tree. When Akroor Jee descended from the ruth with\nthe intention of bathing, Shree Krishnu Chund said to Nund Rae, "Be pleased to\ntake all the cowherds\' children on with you, my uncle Akroor will bathe, and\nwe will join you by and bye."\n\nNund Jee, on hearing these words, went forward. And Akroor Jee undressed; and\nhaving washed his hands and feet, sipping a little water from the palm of his\nhand, he went upon the bank and into the water. After this, he dipped his head\nunder water, performed pooja, poured out a libation of water\n\np. 140\n\nto the manes of deceased ancestors, engaged in prayers and meditations; and\nafter having dived his head under the water, opened his eyes, and beheld Shree\nKrishnu and his ruth in the water.\n\nHe then raised his head, and saw the lord of the Judoos in the same place, as\nhe first occupied. He was astonished on reflecting upon this strange\nappearance, when he saw Krishnu far off on the ruth. They were both under the\nshade of a fig tree: and he saw them both in the water. He said to himself, "I\ncannot understand the mystery of their being both out of the water, and in it.\nWhich shall I call the real figures?"\n\nO great king! Akroor Jee, on seeing the same forms in and out of the water,\nwas thinking of the phoenomenon; when in the mean while, Shree Krishnu Chund\nJee appeared first of all in a form with four arms; and bearing a shell,\nquoit, club and lotus; and the gods, sages, celestial musicians and dancers\ntogether with all the worshippers of Huri, appeared in the water: and\nafterwards, Krishnu appeared as the sleeper on the serpent Sheshu. On\nbeholding this Akroor Jee was still more perplexed.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XLI](psa42.htm)\n\n'
