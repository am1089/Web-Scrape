There are four castes (var _n_ a), Brahma _n_ as, Kshatriyas, Vai _s_ yas,\nand _S_ udras. 1\n\n2\\. Three castes, Brahma _n_ as, Kshatriyas, and Vai _s_ yas, (are called)\ntwice-born.\n\n3\\. Their first birth is from their mother; the second from the investiture\nwith the sacred girdle. In that (second birth) the Savitri is the mother, but\nthe teacher is said to be the father. 3\n\n4\\. They call the teacher father, because he gives instruction in the Veda. 4\n\n5\\. They quote also (the following passage from the Veda) to the same\n(effect): \'Of two kinds, forsooth, is the virile energy of a man learned in\nthe Vedas, that which (resides) above the navel and the other which below (the\nnavel) descends down-wards. Through that which (resides) above the navel, his\noffspring is produced, when he initiates Brahma _n_ as, when he teaches them,\nwhen he causes them to offer oblations, when he makes them holy. By that which\nresides below the navel the children of his body are produced. Therefore they\nnever say, to a _S_ rotriya, who teaches the Veda, "Thud art destitute of\noffspring."\' 5\n\np. 10\n\n6\\. Harita also quotes (the following verse): \'No religious rite can be\nperformed by a (child) before he has been girt with the sacred girdle, since\nhe is on a level with a _S_ udra before his (new) birth from the Veda.\' 6\n\n7\\. (The above prohibition refers to all rites) except those connected with\nlibations of water, (the exclamation) Svadha, and the manes. 7\n\n8\\. Sacred learning approached a Brahma _n_ a (and said to him), \'Preserve me,\nI am thy treasure, reveal me not to a scorner, nor to a wicked man, nor to one\nof uncontrolled passions: so (preserved) I shall become strong.\' 8\n\n9\\. \'Reveal me, O Brahma _n_ a, as to the keeper of thy treasure, to him whom\nthou shalt know to be pure, attentive, intelligent, and chaste, who will not\noffend thee nor revile thee.\'\n\n10\\. \'(That man) who fills his ears with truth, who frees him from pain and\nconfers immortality upon him, (the pupil) shall consider as his father and\nmother; him he must never grieve nor revile.\' 10\n\n11\\. \'As those Brahma _n_ as who, after receiving instruction, do not honour\ntheir teacher by their speech, in their hearts or by their acts, will not be\nprofitable to their teacher, even so that sacred learning (which they\nacquired) will not profit them.\'\n\np. 11\n\n12\\. \'As fire consumes dry grass, even so the Veda, asked for, (but) not\nhonoured, (destroys the enquirer). Let him not proclaim the Veda to that man,\nwho does not show him honour according to his ability.\'\n\n13\\. The (lawful) occupations of a Brahma _n_ a are six, 13\n\n14\\. Studying the Veda, teaching, sacrificing for himself, sacrificing for.\nothers, giving alms, and accepting gifts. 14\n\n15\\. (The lawful occupations) of a Kshatriya are three,\n\n16\\. Studying, sacrificing for himself, and bestowing gifts;\n\n17\\. And his peculiar duty is to protect the people with his weapons; let him\ngain his livelihood thereby.\n\n18\\. (The lawful occupations) of a Vai _s_ ya are the same (as those mentioned\nabove, Sutra 16),\n\n19\\. Besides, agriculture, trading, tending cattle, and lending money at\ninterest,\n\n20\\. To serve those (superior castes) has been fixed as the means of\nlivelihood for a _S_ udra. 20\n\n21\\. (Men of) all (castes) may wear their hair arranged according to the\ncustoms fixed (for their family), or allow it to hang down excepting the lock\non the crown of the head. 21\n\np. 12\n\n22\\. Those who are unable to live by their own lawful occupation may adopt\n(that of) the next inferior (caste), 22\n\n23\\. But never (that of a) higher (caste).\n\n24\\. (A Brahma _n_ a and a Kshatriya) who have re-sorted to a Vai _s_ ya\'s\nmode of living, and maintain themselves by trade (shall not sell) stones,\nsalt, hempen (cloth), silk, linen (cloth), and skins, 24\n\n25\\. Nor any kind of dyed cloth,\n\n26\\. Nor prepared food, flowers, fruit, roots, per-fumes, substances (used\nfor) flavouring (food); nor water, the juice extracted from plants; nor Soma,\nweapons, poison; nor flesh, nor milk, nor preparations from it, iron, tin,\nlac, and lead, 26\n\n27\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): \'By (selling) flesh, lac, and\nsalt a Brahma _n_ a at once becomes an outcast; by selling milk he. becomes\n(equal to) a _S_ udra after three days.\' 27\n\n28\\. Among tame animals those with uncloven hoofs, and those that have an\nabundance of hair, (must not be sold), nor any wild animals, (nor) birds, nor\nbeasts that have tusks (or fangs).\n\n29\\. Among the various kinds of grain they mention sesamum (as forbidden). 29\n\np. 13\n\n30\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): If he applies sesamum to any\nother purpose, but food, anointing, and charitable gifts, he will be born\nagain as a worm and, together with his ancestors, be plunged into his own\nordure.\' 30\n\n31\\. Or, at pleasure, they may sell (sesamum), if they themselves have\nproduced it by tillage. 31\n\n32\\. For that purpose he shall plough before breakfast with two bulls whose\nnoses have not been pierced.\n\n33\\. (If he ploughs) in the hot season, he shall water (his beasts even in the\nmorning).\n\n34\\. The plough is attended by strong males, provided with a useful share and\nwith a handle (to be held) by the drinker of Soma; that raises (for him) a\ncow, a sheep, a stout damsel, and a swift horse for the chariot. 34\n\n35\\. The plough is attended by strong males, i.e. is attended by strong men\nand bullocks, provided with a useful share--for its share is useful (because)\nwith the share it raises, i.e. pierces deep--and provided with a handle for\nthe drinker of Soma,--for Soma reaches him,--possessing a handle for him. That\nraises a cow, a sheep, goats, horses, mules, donkeys and camels, and a stout\ndamsel, i.e. a beautiful, useful maiden in the flower of her youth.\n\n36\\. For how could the plough raise (anything for him) if he did not sell\ngrain?\n\np. 14\n\n37\\. Substances used for flavouring may be bartered for (other) substances of\nthe same kind, be it for one more valuable or for one worth less. 37\n\n38\\. But salt must never (be exchanged) for (other) substances-used for\nflavouring (food).\n\n39\\. It is permitted to barter sesamum, rice, cooked food, learning, and\nslaves (each for its own kind and the one for the other).\n\n40\\. A Brahma _n_ a and a Kshatriya shall not lend (anything at interest\nacting like) usurers. 40\n\n41\\. Now they quote also (the following verses): \'He who acquiring property\ncheap, gives it for a high price, is called a usurer and blamed among those\nwho recite the Veda.\'\n\n42\\. \'(Brahman) weighed in the scales the crime of killing a learned Brahma\n_n_ a against (the crime of) usury; the slayer of the Brahma _n_ a remained at\nthe top, the usurer sank downwards.\'\n\n43\\. Or, at pleasure, they may lend to a person who entirely neglects his\nsacred duties, and is exceedingly wicked, 43\n\n44\\. Gold (taking) double (its value on repayment, and) grain trebling (the\noriginal price). 44\n\np. 15\n\n45\\. (The case of) flavouring substances has been explained by (the rule\nregarding) grain,\n\n46\\. As well as (the case of) flowers, roots, and fruit.\n\n47\\. (They may lend) what is sold by weight, (taking) eight times (the\noriginal value on repayment). 47\n\n48\\. Now they quote also (the following verses): \'Two in the hundred, three\nand four and five, as has teen declared in the Sm _ri_ ti, he may take as\ninterest by the month according to the order of the castes.\' 48\n\n49\\. \'But the king\'s death shall stop the interest on money (lent);\' 49\n\n50\\. \'And after the coronation of (a new) king the capital grows again.\'\n\np. 16\n\n51\\. \'Hear the interest for a money-lender declared by the words of Vasish\n_th_ a, five mash\'s for twenty (karshapa _n_ as may be taken every month);\nthus the law is not violated.\' 51\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[9:1](sbe1405.htm#fr_89)-2. **II**. Vish _n_ u II, 1-2; Manu X, 4.\n\n[9:3](sbe1405.htm#fr_90) Identical with Manu II, 169a, 170a, and Vish _n_ u\nXXVIII, 37-38. The Savitri or the verse addressed to Savit _ri_ is found Rig-\nveda III, 62, 10.\n\n[9:4](sbe1405.htm#fr_91) Gautama I, 10; Manu II, 171.\n\n[9:5](sbe1405.htm#fr_92) The reading tathapyudaharanti, which several of my\nMSS. give, seems to me preferable to K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita\'s\nudaharati. K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita explains sadhu karoti, \'makes them\nholy,\' by adhyatmam upadi _s_ ati,\' teaches them transcendental knowledge.\'\n\n[10:6](sbe1405.htm#fr_93) Vish _n_ u XXVIII, 40. Instead of K _ri_ sh _n_ apa\n_n_ _d_ ita\'s \'yavadvedo na _g_ ayate,\' \'yavadvede na _g_ ayate,\' which occurs\nin several MSS. and in the parallel passages of Manu II, 172 and other Sm _ri_\ntis, must be read.\n\n[10:7](sbe1405.htm#fr_94) Gautama II, 5. The rites referred to are the funeral\nrites.\n\n[10:8](sbe1405.htm#fr_95)-9. Vish _n_ u XXIX, 9-10, and introduction, p.\nxxiii; Nirukta II, 4.\n\n[10:10](sbe1405.htm#fr_96) Vish _n_ u XXX, 47.\n\n[11:13](sbe1405.htm#fr_97) K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita wrongly connects the\nword brahma _n_ asya with the next Sutra. For this and the next seven Sutras,\ncompare Vish _n_ u II, 4-14.\n\n[11:14](sbe1405.htm#fr_98) K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita by mistake leaves out\nthe word \'danam.\'\n\n[11:20](sbe1405.htm#fr_99) I read \'tesham pari _k_ arya,\' with the majority of\nthe MSS., instead of K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita\'s \'tesha _m_ _k_ a pari _k_\narya.\'\n\n[11:21](sbe1405.htm#fr_100) In illustration of this Sutra K _ri_ sh _n_ apa\n_n_ _d_ ita quotes a verse of Laugakshi, which states that Brahma _n_ as\nbelonging to the Vasish _th_ a family wore the top-lock on the right side of\nthe head, and the members of the Atri family allowed it to hang down on p. 12\nboth sides, while the Bh _ri_ gus shaved their heads, and the \xc3\x82\xe1\xb9\x85girasas wore\nfive locks ( _k_ u _d_ a) on the crown of the head. Cf. Max Muller, Hist. Anc.\nSansk. Lit., p. 53.\n\n[12:22](sbe1405.htm#fr_101) Vish _n_ u II, 15.\n\n[12:24](sbe1405.htm#fr_102) For this and the following four Sutras, see\nGautama VII, 8-21.\n\n[12:26](sbe1405.htm#fr_103) Rasa _h_ , \'substances used for flavouring,\' i.e.\n\'molasses, sugar-cane, sugar, and the like.\'--K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita.\nSee also note on Gautama VII, 9.\n\n[12:27](sbe1405.htm#fr_104) Identical with Manu X, 92.\n\n[12:29](sbe1405.htm#fr_105) Vish _n_ u LIV, 18; \xc3\x82pastamba I, 7, 20, 13. K _ri_\nsh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita wrongly connects this Sutra with the preceding one.\n\n[13:30](sbe1405.htm#fr_106) Manu X, 91.\n\n[13:31](sbe1405.htm#fr_107) Manu X, 90.\n\n[13:34](sbe1405.htm#fr_108) Va _g_ asaneyi-sa _m_ hita XII, 71. The\ntranslation follows the explanation given in the next Sutra as closely as\npossible, though the latter is without doubt erroneous. The purpose for which\nVasish _th_ a introduces it, is to show that a Vedic text permits agriculture\nto a Brahma _n_ a who offers Soma-sacrifices.\n\n[14:37](sbe1405.htm#fr_109)-39. Gautama VII, 16-21.\n\n[14:40](sbe1405.htm#fr_110) Manu X, 117. K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita reads\nwith MS. B., vardhushi _m_ na dadyatam, and explains it by v _ri_ ddhi _m_\nnaiva prayo _g_ ayetam, \'they shall not take interest.\' I read with the other\nMSS. vardhushi, and translate that term by \'usurers.\' Below, Sutra 42,\nvardhushi is used likewise in this its usual sense.\n\n[14:43](sbe1405.htm#fr_111) Manu X, 117.\n\n[14:44](sbe1405.htm#fr_112)-47. Vish _n_ u VI, 11-17; Colebrooke I, Dig. LXVI,\nwhere \'silver and gems\' have been added after gold, and rasa _h_ , \'flavouring\nsubstances,\' been translated by \'fluids.\' The translation differs also in\nother respects, because there the Sutras stand by themselves, while here the\nnouns in Sutras 44 and 47 are governed by the preceding dadyatam, \'they may\nlend.\' They, i.e. a Brahma _n_ a p. 15 and a Kshatriya. The rule, of course,\nrefers to other castes also, and to those cases where no periodical interest\nis taken, but the loan returned in kind.\n\n[15:47](sbe1405.htm#fr_113) The Ratnakara quoted by Colebrooke loc. cit. takes\n\'what is sold by weight\' to be \'camphor and the like.\' K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_\n_d_ ita thinks that \'clarified butter, honey, spirituous liquor, oil,\nmolasses, and salt\' are meant. But most of these substances fall under the\nterm rasa _h_ , \'flavouring substances.\' The proper explanation of the words\nseems to be, \'any other substance not included among those mentioned\npreviously, which is sold by weight.\'\n\n[15:48](sbe1405.htm#fr_114) Vish _n_ u VI, 2, and especially Manu VIII, 142.\nThe lowest rate of interest is to be taken from the highest caste, and it\nbecomes greater with decreasing respectability. According to K _ri_ sh _n_ apa\n_n_ _d_ ita and the commentators on the parallel passage of Vish _n_ u, Manu,\nand other Sm _ri_ tis, this rule applies only to loans for which no security\nis given--a statement which is doubtlessly correct.\n\n[15:49](sbe1405.htm#fr_115)-50. Both the reading and the sense of this verse,\nwhich in some MSS. is wanting, are somewhat doubtful. I read with my best\nMSS.,\n\nra _g_ a to m _ri_ tabhavena dravyav _ri_ ddhi _m_ vina _s_ ayet |  \npuna ra _g_ abhisheke _n_ a dravyamula _m_ _k_ a vardhate ||\n\nand consider that it gives a rule, ordering all money transactions to be\nstopped during the period which intervenes between the death of a king and the\ncoronation of his successor. I am, however, unable to point out any parallel\npassages confirming this p. 16 view. K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita\'s text\nshows two important various readings, \'bh _ri_ tibhavena\' and \'ra _g_\nabhishikena,\' which I think are merely conjectures, unsupported by the\nauthority of MSS. He explains the verse as follows: \'The king shall destroy,\ni.e. himself not take, the interest on money by giving [it away] as a salary.\nBut, after thus giving away interest received, he may increase his capital by\n[an extra tax imposed on] the cultivators, i.e. take from them the highest\nrate, consisting of one-fourth of the produce.\'\n\n[16:51](sbe1405.htm#fr_116) Gautama XII, 29; Colebrooke I, Dig. XXIV. The rule\ngiven in this Sutra refers, as K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita correctly states,\nto loans, for which security is given. The rate is 1\xc2\xbc per cent for the month,\nor 15 per annum; see the note to Gautama loc. cit. Manu, VIII, 140, especially\nmentions that this rate is prescribed by Vasish _th_ a.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter III](sbe1406.htm)\n\n'
