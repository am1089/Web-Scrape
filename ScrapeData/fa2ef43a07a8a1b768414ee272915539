XXV.\n\nBalarama finds wine in the hollow of a tree; becomes inebriated; commands the\nYamuna to come to him, and on her refusal drags her out of her course: Lakshmi\ngives him ornaments and a dress: he returns to Dwaraka, and marries Revati.\n\nWHILST the mighty \xc5\x9aesha 1, the upholder of the globe, was thus engaged in\nwandering amidst the forests with the herdsmen, in the disguise of a mortal--\nhaving rendered great services to earth, and still considering what more was\nto be achieved--Varun\xcc\x81a, in order to provide for his recreation, said to his\nwife Varun\xcc\x81i (the goddess of wine), "Thou, Madira, art ever acceptable to the\npowerful Ananta; go therefore, auspicious and kind goddess, and promote his\nenjoyments." Obeying these commands, Varuni went and established herself in\nthe hollow of a Kadamba tree in the woods of Vrindavana. Baladeva, roaming\nabout, came there, and smelling the pleasant fragrance of liquor, resumed his\nancient passion for strong drink. The holder of the ploughshare observing the\nvinous drops distilling from the Kadamba tree, was much delighted, and\ngathered and quaffed them 2 along with the herdsmen and the Gopis, whilst\nthose who were skilful with voice and lute celebrated him in their songs.\nBeing inebriated with the wine, and the drops of perspiration standing like\npearls upon his limbs, he called out, not knowing what he said, "Come hither,\nYamuna river, I want to bathe." The river, disregarding the words of a drunken\nman, came not at his bidding: on which\n\np. 572\n\n[paragraph continues] Rama in a rage took up his ploughshare, which he plunged\ninto her bank, and dragged her to him, calling out, "Will you not come, you\njade? will you not come? Now go where you please (if you can)." Thus saying,\nhe compelled the dark river to quit its ordinary course, and follow him\nwhithersoever he wandered through the wood. Assuming a mortal figure, the\nYamuna, with distracted looks, approached Balabhadra, and entreated him to\npardon her, and let her go: but he replied, "I will drag you with my\nploughshare in a thousand directions, since you contemn my prowess and\nstrength." At last, however, appeased by her reiterated prayers, he let her\ngo, after she had watered all the country 3. When he had bathed, the goddess\nof beauty, Lakshmi, came and gave him a beautiful lotus to place in one ear,\nand an earring for the other; a fresh necklace of lotus flowers, sent by\nVarun\xcc\x81a; and garments of a dark blue colour, as costly as the wealth of the\nocean: and thus decorated with a lotus in one ear, a ring in the other,\ndressed in blue garments, and wearing a garland, Balarama appeared united with\nloveliness. Thus decorated, Rama sported two months in Vraja, and then\nreturned to Dwaraka, where the married Revati, the daughter of king Raivata,\nby whom he had two sons, Nishat\xcc\x81ha and Ulmuka 4.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[571:1](vp142.htm#fr_1530) The great serpent, of whom Balarama is an\nincarnation.\n\n[571:2](vp142.htm#fr_1531) There is no vinous exudation from the Kadamba tree\n(Nauclea Kadamba), but its flowers are said to yield a spirit by distillation;\nwhence Kadambari is one of the synonymes of wine, or spiritous\n[liquor](errata.htm#24). The grammarians, however, also derive the word from\nsome legend, stating it to be so called because it was produced from the\nhollow of a Kadamba tree on the Gomantha mountain. The Hari Van\xc5\x9ba, which alone\nmakes the Gomantha mountain the scene of an exploit of Krishn\xcc\x81a and Rama,\nmakes no mention of this origin of wine; and the Bhagavata merely says that\nVarun\xcc\x81i took up her abode in the hollow of a tree. There must be some other\nauthority therefore for this story.\n\n[572:3](vp142.htm#fr_1532) The Bhagavata and Hari Van\xc5\x9ba repeat this story; the\nlatter very imperfectly; the former adds, that the Yamuna is still to be seen\nfollowing the course along which she was dragged by Balarama. The legend\nprobably alludes to the construction of canals from the Jumna, for the\npurposes of irrigation; and the works of the Mohammedans in this way, which\nare well known, were no doubt preceded by similar canals dug by order of Hindu\nprinces.\n\n[572:4](vp142.htm#fr_1533) See page [439](vp108.htm#page_439).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXVI](vp143.htm)\n\n'
