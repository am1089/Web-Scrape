Coming to one body\nafter another they become ripened in their respective ways 2. As a fruitful\n(tree) producing fruit may yield much fruit, so does merit performed with a\npure mind become expanded 3. Sin, too, performed with a sinful mind, is\nsimilarly (expanded). For the self engages in action, putting forward this\nmind 4. And now further, hear how 5 a man, overwhelmed with action, and\nenveloped in desire and anger 6, enters a womb. Within the womb of a woman,\n(he) obtains-as the result of action a body good or else bad 7, made up of\nvirile semen and blood. Owing to (his) subtlety and imperceptibility, though\nhe obtains a body appertaining to the Brahman, he is not attached anywhere;\nhence is he the eternal Brahman 8. That is the seed of all beings; by that\n\np. 242\n\nall creatures exist. That soul, entering all the limbs of the f\xc2\x9ctus, part by\npart, and dwelling in the seat of the life-wind 1, supports (them) with the\nmind 2. Then the f\xc2\x9ctus, becoming possessed of consciousness, moves about its\nlimbs. As liquefied iron being poured out assumes the form of the image 3,\nsuch you must know is the entrance of the soul into the f\xc2\x9ctus. As fire\nentering a ball of iron, heats it, such too, you must understand, is the\nmanifestation of the soul in the f\xc2\x9ctus. And as a blazing lamp shines in a\nhouse, even so does consciousness light up bodies 4. And whatever action he\nperforms, whether good or bad, everything done in a former body must\nnecessarily be enjoyed (or suffered). Then 5 that is exhausted, and again\nother (action) is accumulated, so long as the piety which dwells in the\npractice of concentration of mind for final emancipation 6 has not been\nlearnt. As to that, O best (of men)! I will tell you about that action by\nwhich, verily, one going the round of various births, becomes happy. Gifts,\npenance, life as a Brahma _k_ arin, adherence to prescribed regulations,\nrestraint of the senses 7, and also\n\np. 243\n\ntranquillity, compassion to (all) beings, self-restraint, and absence of\ncruelty, refraining from the appropriation of the wealth of others, not acting\ndishonestly even in thought towards (any) being in this world, serving mother\nand father, honouring deities and guests, honouring preceptors, pity, purity,\nconstant restraint of the organs 1, and causing good to be done; this is said\nto be the conduct of the good 2. From this is produced piety, which protects\npeople to eternity. Thus one should look (for it) among the good, for among\nthem it constantly abides. The practice to which the good adhere, points out\n(what) piety (is) 3. And among them dwells that (course of) action which\nconstitutes eternal piety. He who acquires that, never comes to an evil end 4.\nBy this are people held in check from making a slip in the paths of piety 5.\nBut the devotee who is released 6 is esteemed higher than these. For the\ndeliverance from the course of worldly life of the man who acts piously and\nwell, as he should act, takes place after a long time 7. Thus a creature\nalways meets with (the effects of) the action performed (in a) previous\n(life). And that 8 is the sole cause by which he comes here (in a) degraded\n(form). There is\n\np. 244\n\nin the world a doubt as to what originally was the source from which he became\ninvested with a body. And that I shall now proceed to state. Brahman, the\ngrandfather of all people, having Made a body for himself, created the whole\nof the three worlds, moving and fixed 1. From that he created the Pradhana,\nthe material cause of all embodied (selfs), by which all this is pervaded, and\nwhich is known in the world as the highest 2. This is what is called the\ndestructible 3; but the other 4 is immortal and indestructible. And Pra _g_\napati, who had been first created, created all creatures and (all) the fixed\nentities, (having) as regards the moving (creation), a pair separately for\neach 5 (species). Such is the ancient (tradition) heard (by us). And as\nregards that, the grandsire fixed a limit of time, and (a rule) about\nmigrations among (various) creatures, and about the return 6. What I say is\nall correct and proper, like (what may be said by) any talented person who has\nin\n\np. 245\n\na former birth perceived the self [1](sbe0831.htm#fn_1137). He who properly\nperceives pleasure and pain to be inconstant, the body to be an unholy\naggregate  [2](sbe0831.htm#fn_1138), and ruin to be connected with action\n[3](sbe0831.htm#fn_1139), and who remembers that whatever little there is of\nhappiness is all misery [4](sbe0831.htm#fn_1140), he will cross beyond the\nfearful ocean of worldly life, which is very difficult to cross. He who\nunderstands the Pradhana [5](sbe0831.htm#fn_1141), (though) attacked by birth\nand death and disease, sees one (principle of) consciousness in all beings\npossessed of consciousness [6](sbe0831.htm#fn_1142). Then seeking after the\nsupreme seat, he becomes indifferent to everything [7](sbe0831.htm#fn_1143). O\nbest (of men)! I will give you accurate instruction concerning it. Learn from\nme exhaustively, O Brahma _n_ a! the excellent knowledge concerning the\neternal imperishable seat, which I am now about to declare.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[241:1](sbe0830.htm#fr_1113) Cf. Maitri-upanishad, p. 53, and Mu _nd_ aka, p.\n270. And see generally as to this passage, _S_ ariraka Bhashya, pp. 751-760.\n\n[241:2](sbe0830.htm#fr_1114) I. e. they yield their respective fruits; cf.\nMaitri, p. 43, and _Kh_ andogya, p. 358.\n\n[241:3](sbe0830.htm#fr_1115) This explains, say the commentators, how even a\nlittle merit or sin requires sometimes more than one birth to enjoy and\nexhaust,\n\n[241:4](sbe0830.htm#fr_1116) As a king performs sacrifices 'putting forward' a\npriest, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra; and cf. Dhammapada, the first two verses.\n\n[241:5](sbe0830.htm#fr_1117) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra has tatha, 'in the same\nway,' instead of this, and renders it to mean 'putting forward' the mind.\n\n[241:6](sbe0830.htm#fr_1118) Hence he does not get rid of birth and death.\n\n[241:7](sbe0830.htm#fr_1119) Good = of gods or men; bad = of the lower species\nof creatures, Ar _g_ una.\n\n[241:8](sbe0830.htm#fr_1120) He, in the preceding sentences, according to Ar\n_g_ una Mi _s_ ra, means the self, through the mind, or 'putting forward' the\nmind, as said above. In this sentence, he takes 'he' to mean the mind itself;\nBrahman = the self; and the mind, he says, is called the Brahman, as it, like\nthe self, is the cause of the _K_ aitanya, intelligence, in all creatures.\n\n[242:1](sbe0830.htm#fr_1121) I. e. the heart.\n\n[242:2](sbe0830.htm#fr_1122) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says that the. soul at the\nbeginning of the sentence means the mind, and mind here means knowledge or\nintelligence. Cf. [p. 238](sbe0829.htm#page_238) supra.\n\n[242:3](sbe0830.htm#fr_1123) In the mould of which, that is to say, it is\npoured.\n\n[242:4](sbe0830.htm#fr_1124) Cf. Gita, [p. 106](sbe0815.htm#page_106). The\nthree similes, says Nilaka _nth_ a, show that the soul pervades the whole\nbody, is yet imperceptible, and also unattached to the body. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_\nra's explanation is different, but I prefer Nilaka _nth_ a's.\n\n[242:5](sbe0830.htm#fr_1125) I. e. by the enjoyment or suffering.\n\n[242:6](sbe0830.htm#fr_1126) I. e. while he does not possess the knowledge\nwhich leads to the piety necessary as a preliminary for final emancipation,\nand which ultimately destroys action. Cf. Gita, [p. 62](sbe0806.htm#page_62).\n\n[242:7](sbe0830.htm#fr_1127) I. e. keeping the senses of hearing &c. from all\noperationsp. 243 save those relating to the Brahman. Tranquillity is the same\nthing as regards the mind.\n\n[243:1](sbe0830.htm#fr_1128) This I take to mean restraint of the active\norgans, such as speech, &c. 'Self-restraint' is rendered by Nilaka _nth_ a to\nmean 'concentration of mind.'\n\n[243:2](sbe0830.htm#fr_1129) Cf. Maitri, p. 57; _Kh_ andogya, p. 136; and\nGita, pp. [103](sbe0815.htm#page_103), [119](sbe0819.htm#page_119).\n\n[243:3](sbe0830.htm#fr_1130) Cf. \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 1, 2; I, 1, 20, 7; _S_\nakuntala, p. 30 (Williams).\n\n[243:4](sbe0830.htm#fr_1131) Cf. Gita, [p. 72](sbe0808.htm#page_72).\n\n[243:5](sbe0830.htm#fr_1132) By this, i.e. by the practice of the good, Ar _g_\nuna Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[243:6](sbe0830.htm#fr_1133) From delusion, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra; emancipated\nby force of his devotion, Nilakantha.\n\n[243:7](sbe0830.htm#fr_1134) Cf. Gita, [p. 73](sbe0808.htm#page_73); _Kh_\nandogya, pp. 136, 137.\n\n[243:8](sbe0830.htm#fr_1135) Scil. the action.\n\n[244:1](sbe0830.htm#fr_1136) I.e. animate and inanimate. 'A body for himself'\n= undeveloped \xc3\x82ka _s_ a, Nilaka _nth_ a. But see Sa _n_ khya-sara, p. 19, and\nSa _n_ khya Prav. Bhashya I, 122, and III, 10.\n\n[244:2](sbe0830.htm#fr_1137) Cf. inter alia Gita, [p. 58](sbe0805.htm#page_58)\nand note, and Sa _n_ khya-sara, p. 11. As to the words at the beginning of\nthis sentence, 'from that,' cf. Taittiriya-upanishad, p. 67, where everything\nis derived from \xc3\x82ka _s_ a, mentioned in the last note, and \xc3\x82ka _s_ a from the\nBrahman.\n\n[244:3](sbe0830.htm#fr_1138) Cf. Gita, [p. 113](sbe0817.htm#page_113), where\nthere are three principles distinguished from each other.\n\n[244:4](sbe0830.htm#fr_1139) I. e. the self, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[244:5](sbe0830.htm#fr_1140) A pair, i. e. a male and female for each species,\nsuch as man, &c., Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[244:6](sbe0830.htm#fr_1141) Pra _g_ apati fixed the limit of life for every\n'moving' creature, and the rule as to going from one species of body into\nanother, and as to going from one world to another. As to a part of 'the\nancient tradition,' the first stanza of the Mu _nd_ aka-upanishad may be\ncompared.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter IV](sbe0831.htm)\n\n"
