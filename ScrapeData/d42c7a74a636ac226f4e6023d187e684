Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing thus the words of the Mahar _s_ i\nBharadvaja and seeing that he made a firm resolve, the King Yudhajit called\nhis prime minister quickly and asked, \xc2\x93O intelligent one! What am I to do now?\nI want to carry away by force this boy with his mother sweet Manorama; no one\ndesirous of one\xc2\x92s welfare won\xc2\x92t trifle away his enemy, be he even a very weak\none; if he does so, that enemy\n\n\n\np. 187\n\n\n\nwill get stronger day by day, as the disease consumption becomes stronger; and\nwill ultimately become the cause of death.\n\n\n\n4\\. There is no warrior, nor any soldiers here of the other party; no one will\nbe able to resist me; I can take away, as I like, the enemy of my daughter\xc2\x92s\nson and can kill him.\n\n\n\n5\\. I will try to-day to carry him away by force, and Sudars\xc2\x92ana being killed,\nmy daughter\xc2\x92s son will reign fearlessly without an enemy; there in no doubt in\nthis.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n6\\. The prime minister said :-- No such hazardous courage need be shewn now;\nyou have heard the Maharshi's words; he quoted you the example of Vis\xc2\x92vamitra.\n\n\n\n7\\. O King! In days of yore, Vis\xc2\x92vamitra, the son of the King Gadhi, was a\ncelebrated monarch; one day while roaming, he accidentally reached the\nhermitage of Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha.\n\n\n\n8\\. The powerful king Vis\xc2\x92vamitra bowed down before the Muni, and the Muni\ngave him a seat. The king took his seat there.\n\n\n\n9\\. Then the high souled Vas'i _st_ ha invited the king to a dinner.\nVis\xc2\x92vamitra, the king, went there with his whole army.\n\n\n\n10-12. There was a cow, named Nandini, of Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha. The Muni prepared all\nsorts of eatables from her milk and entertained them all. The king with his\nwhole army was very much pleased; and, coming to know of the divine power of\nthe cow, asked Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha to give his cow Nandini over to him and said \xc2\x93The\nudder of your cow Nandini is like a big jar. I will give you thousand cows\nlike that; I pray you to let me have your cow Nandini.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n13\\. Vas'i _st_ ha said \xc2\x93O King! This is my sacrificial cow; I cannot give you\nthis cow in any way, let your thousand cows be yours.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n14\\. Vis'vamitra said :-- \xc2\x93O Saint! I will give you cows lakhs or tens and\nhundreds of lakhs or any number you like. Please give me your cow; in case you\nbe unwilling, I will carry her away perforce.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n15\\. Vas'i _st_ ha said :-- \xc2\x93O King! As you like, better take it perforce; I\nwill never be able to give you my cow Nandini from my house.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n16\\. O King! Hearing thus the Vas'i _st_ ha's words, Vis\xc2\x92vamitra, the King,\nordered at once his powerful followers to carry the cow Nandini away by\nfastening a cord round her neck per sheer force.\n\n\n\n17-19. The followers, obeying the order at once bound the cow with ropes and\nbegan to carry her away by force. At this Nandini, trembling and with tears in\nher eyes, began to say to the Muni \xc2\x93O One! whose wealth consists only in\nasceticism! Are you going to leave me? Otherwise\n\n\n\np. 188\n\n\n\nwhy these fellows are binding me with a cord and dragging me away?\xc2\x94 At this\nthe Muni replied \xc2\x93O Nandini! I have never parted with you; I perform all my\nsacrifices through your milk. O auspicious one! I honoured this king, my\nguests, with eatables prepared from your food and for that reason he is\ncarrying you away from me by sheer force. What can I do? O Nandini! I have not\nthe least desire to part with you.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n20\\. Hearing these words from the Muni, the cow became very angry and bellowed\nloudly and terribly.\n\n\n\n21\\. At once came out from her body, on that very spot, the terrible demons\nwearing coats of armour, and holding various weapons; and they uttered aloud,\n\xc2\x93Wait; you will soon meet with vengeance.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n22\\. They then destroyed all the forces of the king. And the king alone was\nleft and he went away alone, much dejected and sorrowful.\n\n\n\n23\\. Oh! That wicked king then cursed with great humility the K _s_ attriya\nS\xc2\x92akti; and thinking the Brahmanic power would be attained with great\nexertion, began to practise asceticism and penance.\n\n\n\n24\\. Performing penance and tapasya, very hard indeed, in the great forest,\nVis'vamitra, the son of Gadhi, succeeded at last in becoming a Ri _s_ i and\nthen he renounced his K _s_ attriya Dharma.\n\n\n\n25\\. Therefore, O King! Dost Thou never quarrel with these ascetics and be\ninvolved in wars resulting in great enmity and causing the extinction of the\nrace.\n\n\n\n26\\. Better dost thou appease the Muni and now go back to your own kingdom.\nLet Sudars'ana remain here at his pleasure.\n\n\n\n27\\. O King! This minor boy has no wealth; what harm can he do to you? It is\nuseless to show your enmity towards an orphan, a weak minor boy.\n\n\n\n28\\. This world is under the control of Destiny; therefore one should shew\nmercy to all. O king! What use is there to shew one\xc2\x92s jealousy? What is\ninevitable will surely come to pass.\n\n\n\n29\\. O king! The thunderbolt comes sometimes like a blade of grass; a blade of\ngrass acts sometimes like a thunderbolt.\n\n\n\n30\\. O king! You are very intelligent; consider that by, combinations of\ncircumstances, a hair can kill a powerful tiger and a gnat can kill an\nelephant. Therefore dost thou forsake this rashness and hear my beneficent\nadvice.\n\n\n\n31\\. Vyasa said :-- O king! The best of kings, Yudhajit hearing the prime\nminister's advice bowed down humbly at the feet of the Muni and returned to\nhis own city.\n\n\n\np. 189\n\n\n\n32\\. Manorama, too, became free from anxiety, and, remaining peaceful in the\nhermitage, began to nourish and support her child, engaged in vows.\n\n\n\n33\\. The lovely son of the king began to grow daily like the phases of the\nwaxing moon and sport fearlessly with the boys of the Munis, altogether,\nwherever they liked, a sight very auspicious.\n\n\n\n34\\. One day the minister Vidalla came there and the sons of the Munis seeing\nhim began, in the presence of Sudars\xc2\x92ana, to address him \xc2\x93Klib,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93Klib.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n35\\. Sudars\xc2\x92ana, too, hearing them pronounce \xc2\x93Klib,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93Klib\xc2\x94 took up the one\nletter, \xc2\x93Kli\xc2\x94 and uttered this only repeatedly, which is, in fact the prince\nof the root mantras of Kama, with anusvara omitted.\n\n\n\n36\\. Then the son of the king took that mantram and silently repeated this in\nhis mind.\n\n\n\n37\\. O King! Thus that boy Sudars'ana was initiated in this root mantra of\nKama (desire) spontaneously, out of his original Samskara (innate tendency)\nowing to the unavoidable destiny of Fate.\n\n\n\n38-39. The son of the king, when he was five years old, got this most\nexcellent mantra, though without its Ri _s_ i (seer), meditation, without its\nchhanda (metre) and without Nyasa (assignment of the various parts of the body\nto different deities, accompanied with prayers and corresponding\ngesticulations), and considered this as the quintessence of all, therefore\nmeditated this always in his mind spontaneously and never forgot it.\n\n\n\n40-41. When the king's son grew eleven years old, the Muni performed his\nUpanayana (sacred thread) ceremony and made him begin the study of the Vedas.\nThe son, with that mantra power, soon mastered all the studies about archery,\nall the moral and political sciences in conformity with proper rules, within a\nvery short time.\n\n\n\n42-43. One day Sudars'ana got a vision of the form of the Supreme Goddess, of\na red colour, wearing red apparel and decorated with red ornaments, mounting\non Garu _d_ a and with Her wonderful Vai _sn_ avi powers and Her face, fully\nopened like the budding of a lotus flower.\n\n\n\n44\\. Thus, expert in many branches of learning, Sudars\xc2\x92ana served his Mother\nin that forest and began to wander on the banks of the Ganges.\n\n\n\n45\\. One day the Mother of the Universe gave the bows, sharpened arrows,\nquiver and a mail coat of armour to that boy in that forest.\n\n\n\np. 190\n\n\n\n46-47. O King! At this time the extraordinary beautiful and lovely princess\nS\xc2\x92as\xc2\x92ikala, endowed with all auspicious qualities, the daughter of the king of\nKashi, came to hear that a beautiful prince named Sudars\xc2\x92ana, a second\nKandarpa, full of heroism and endowed with all auspicious qualities is\ndwelling in a forest.\n\n\n\n48\\. The princess, hearing this from a soothsayer, mentally loved and desired\nhim and wanted finally to accept him as her legal husband.\n\n\n\n49-50. Thus, on one occasion, at the end of a night (night-fall), the Goddess\nappeared in her dreams before her and consoled her and said \xc2\x93O fair one! ask a\nboon from me; Sudars\xc2\x92ana is my devotee; he will fulfill, at my word, all your\ndesires.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n51\\. Thus seeing the beautiful figure of the Goddess in her dreams and hearing\nHer sweet words, the honoured S\xc2\x92as\xc2\x92ikala was drowned in the ocean of bliss.\n\n\n\n52\\. When the princess awoke, her face beaming with gladness, her mother\nperceived her joy and inferred that her daughter must have been internally\nvery glad, and asked her repeatedly, but S\xc2\x92as\xc2\x92ikala was too much abashed and\ndid not give vent to the cause of her satisfaction.\n\n\n\n53\\. The princess, remembering her dreams, began to laugh repeatedly on\naccount of her excessive joy. At last she spoke out in detail all about her\ndreams to one of her lady friends, or companions.\n\n\n\n54\\. On one occasion, that large eyed S\xc2\x92as\xc2\x92ikala went out for enjoyment to a\nnice garden beautified with champaka flowers, attended by her companion.\n\n\n\n55\\. While the King\xc2\x92s daughter seated under a champaka tree, was collecting\nflowers, she saw a Brahmi _n_ , coming towards her in great haste.\n\n\n\n56\\. After bowing down before him, that beautiful princess, endowed with all\nauspicious qualifications, addressed him in sweet words \xc2\x93O blessed one! whence\nare you coming?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n57\\. The Brahma _n_ a said :-- \xc2\x93O girl! I am coming on an errand from the\nhermitage of Bharadvaja Muni. Please mention what you are going to ask me?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n58\\. S\xc2\x92as\xc2\x92ikala replied \xc2\x93O Noble one! What beautiful thing is therein that\nhermitage that is extraordinary and worth describing.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n59\\. The Brahma _n_ a said \xc2\x93O fair one! There is staying the most lovely\nSudars\xc2\x92ana, the son of the King Dhruvasandhi. He is the loveliest of all men.\n\n\n\np. 191\n\n\n\n60\\. O fair one! He who has not seen him, I think, has his eyes given to him\nin vain.\n\n\n\n61\\. O auspicious one! It appears as if the Creator, with a view to see how it\nlooks, has invested him with all the qualities.\n\n\n\n62\\. O beautiful one! what shall I say more to you, suffice to say that, that\nprince is fit to become your husband. I think that the Creator has, no doubt,\nsettled already the union between you two, as a happy union of two congenial\nthings (gold in union with Jewel).\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nThus ends the seventeenth chapter on the story of Vis\xc2\x92vamitra and on the\ngetting of the root mantra of Kama by the son of the King in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam, of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 18](bk03ch18.htm)\n\n"
