II.\n\nPrayer of Para\xc5\x9bara to Vishn\xcc\x81u. Successive narration of the Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a.\nExplanation of Vasudeva: his existence before creation: his first\nmanifestations. Description of Pradhana or the chief principle of things.\nCosmogony. Of Prakrita, or material creation; of time; of the active cause.\nDevelopement of effects; Mahat; Ahankara; Tanmatras; elements; objects of\nsense; senses; of the mundane egg. Vishn\xcc\x81u the same as Brahma the creator;\nVishn\xcc\x81u the preserver; Rudra the destroyer.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA said, Glory to the unchangeable, holy, eternal, supreme Vishn\xcc\x81u, of\none universal nature, the mighty over all: to him who is Hiranygarbha, Hari,\nand \xc5\x9aankara 1, the creator, the preserver, and destroyer of\n\np. 8\n\nthe world: to Vasudeva, the liberator of his worshippers: to him, whose\nessence is both single and manifold; who is both subtile and corporeal,\nindiscrete and discrete: to Vishn\xcc\x81u, the cause of final emancipation 2, Glory\nto the supreme Vishn\xcc\x81u, the cause of the creation, existence, and end of this\nworld; who is the root of the world, and who consists of the world 3.\n\nHaving glorified him who is the support of all things; who is the smallest of\nthe small 4; who is in all created things; the unchanged, imperishable 5\nPurushottama 6; who is one with true wisdom, as truly known 7; eternal and\nincorrupt; and who is known through false appearances by the nature of visible\nobjects 8: having bowed to Vishn\xcc\x81u, the\n\np. 9\n\ndestroyer, and lord of creation and preservation; the ruler of the world;\nunborn, imperishable, undecaying: I will relate to you that which was\noriginally imparted by the great father of all (Brahma), in answer to the\nquestions of Daksha and other venerable sages, and repeated by them to\nPurukutsa, a king who reigned on the banks of the Narmada. It was next related\nby him to Saraswata, and by Saraswata to me 9.\n\nWho can describe him who is not to be apprehended by the senses: who is the\nbest of all things; the supreme soul, self-existent: who is devoid of all the\ndistinguishing characteristics of complexion, caste, or the like; and is\nexempt front birth, vicissitude, death, or decay: who is always, and alone:\nwho exists every where, and in whom all things here exist; and who is thence\nnamed Vasudeva 10? He is Brahma 11, supreme, lord, eternal, unborn,\nimperishable, undecaying; of one essence; ever pure as free from defects. He,\nthat Brahma, was all things; comprehending in his own nature the indiscrete\nand discrete. He then existed in the forms of Purusha and of Kala. Purusha\n(spirit) is the first form, of the supreme; next proceeded two other forms,\nthe discrete and indiscrete; and Kala (time) was the last. These four--\nPradhana (primary or crude matter), Purusha (spirit), Vyakta (visible\nsubstance), and Kala (time)--the wise consider to be the pure and supreme\ncondition of Vishn\xcc\x81u 12. These four forms, in their due proportions, are the\ncauses of\n\np. 10\n\nthe production of the phenomena of creation, preservation, and destruction.\nVishn\xcc\x81u being thus discrete and indiscrete substance, spirit, and time, sports\nlike a playful boy, as you shall learn by listening to his frolics 13.\n\nThat chief principle (Pradhana), which is the indiscrete cause, is called by\nthe sages also Prakriti (nature): it is subtile, uniform, and comprehends what\nis and what is not (or both causes and effects); is durable, self-sustained,\nillimitable, undecaying, and stable; devoid of sound or touch, and possessing\nneither colour nor form; endowed with the three qualities (in equilibrium);\nthe mother of the world; without beginning; and that into which all that is\nproduced is resolved 14. By\n\np. 11\n\nthat principle all things were invested in the period subsequent to the last\ndissolution of the universe, and prior to creation 15. For Brahmans learned in\nthe Vedas, and teaching truly their doctrines, explain such\n\np. 12\n\npassages as the following as intending the production of the chief principle\n(Pradhana). "There was neither day nor night, nor sky nor earth, nor darkness\nnor light, nor any other thing, save only One, unapprehensible by intellect,\nor That which is Brahma and Puman (spirit) and Pradhana (matter) 16." The two\nforms which are other than the essence of unmodified Vishn\xcc\x81u, are Pradhana\n(matter) and Purusha (spirit); and his other form, by which those two are\nconnected or separated, is called Kala (time) 17. When discrete substance is\naggregated in crude nature, as in a foregone dissolution, that dissolution is\ntermed elemental (Prakrita). The deity as Time is without beginning, and his\nend is not known; and from him the revolutions of creation, continuance, and\ndissolution unintermittingly succeed: for when, in the latter season, the\nequilibrium of the qualities (Pradhana) exists, and spirit (Puman) is detached\nfrom matter, then the form of Vishn\xcc\x81u which is Time abides 18. Then the\n\np. 13\n\nsupreme Brahma, the supreme soul, the substance of the world, the lord of all\ncreatures, the universal soul, the supreme ruler, Hari, of his own will having\nentered into matter and spirit, agitated the mutable and immutable principles,\nthe season of creation being arrived, in the same manner as fragrance affects\nthe mind from its proximity merely, and not from any immediate operation upon\nmind itself: so the Supreme influenced the elements of creation 19.\nPurushottama is both the agitator and\n\np. 14\n\nthe thing to be agitated; being present in the essence of matter, both when it\nis contracted and expanded 20. Vishn\xcc\x81u, supreme over the supreme, is of the\nnature of discrete forms in the atomic productions, Brahma and the rest (gods,\nmen, &c.)\n\nThen from that equilibrium of the qualities (Pradhana), presided over by soul\n21, proceeds the unequal developement of those qualities (constituting the\nprinciple Mahat or Intellect) at the time of creation 22. The\n\np. 15\n\n[paragraph continues] Chief principle then invests that Great principle,\nIntellect, and it becomes threefold, as affected by the quality of goodness,\nfoulness, or darkness, and invested by the Chief principle (matter) as seed is\nby its skin. From the Great principle (Mahat) Intellect, threefold Egotism,\n(Ahankara) 23,\n\np. 16\n\ndenominated Vaikarika, \'pure;\' Taijasa, \'passionate;\' and Bhutadi,\n\'rudimental,\' 24 is produced; the origin of the (subtile) elements, and of the\norgans of sense; invested, in consequence of its three qualities, by\nIntellect, as Intellect is by the Chief principle. Elementary Egotism then\nbecoming productive, as the rudiment of sound, produced from it Ether, of\nwhich sound is the characteristic, investing it with its rudiment of sound.\nEther becoming productive, engendered the rudiment of touch; whence originated\nstrong wind, the property of which is touch; and Ether, with the rudiment of\nsound, enveloped the rudiment of touch. Then wind becoming productive,\nproduced the rudiment of form (colour); whence light (or fire) proceeded, of\nwhich, form (colour) is the attribute; and the rudiment of touch enveloped the\nwind with the rudiment of colour. Light becoming productive, produced the\nrudiment of taste; whence proceed all juices in which flavour resides; and the\nrudiment of colour invested the juices with the rudiment of taste. The waters\nbecoming productive, engendered the rudiment of smell; whence an aggregate\n(earth) originates, of which smell is the property 25. In each several\n\np. 17\n\nelement resides its peculiar rudiment; thence the property of tanmatrata, 26\n(type or rudiment) is ascribed to these elements. Rudimental elements are not\nendowed with qualities, and therefore they are neither soothing, nor terrific,\nnor stupifying 27. This is the elemental creation, proceeding from the\nprinciple of egotism affected by the property of darkness. The organs of sense\nare said to be the passionate products of the same principle, affected by\nfoulness; and the ten divinities 28 proceed from egotism affected by the\nprinciple of goodness; as does Mind, which\n\np. 18\n\nis the eleventh. The organs of sense are ten: of the ten, five are the skin,\neye, nose, tongue, and ear; the object of which, combined with Intellect, is\nthe apprehension of sound and the rest: the organs of excretion and\nprocreation, the hands, the feet, and the voice, form the other five; of which\nexcretion, generation, manipulation, motion, and speaking, are the several\nacts.\n\nThen, ether, air, light, water, and earth, severally united with the\nproperties of sound and the rest, existed as distinguishable according to\ntheir qualities, as soothing, terrific, or stupifying; but possessing various\nenergies, and being unconnected, they could not, without combination, create\nliving beings, not having blended with each other. Having combined, therefore,\nwith one another, they assumed, through their mutual association, the\ncharacter of one mass of entire unity; and from the direction of spirit, with\nthe acquiescence of the indiscrete Principle 29, Intellect and the rest, to\nthe gross elements inclusive, formed an egg 30, which gradually expanded like\na bubble of water. This vast egg, O sage, compounded of the elements, and\nresting on the waters, was the\n\np. 19\n\nexcellent natural abode of Vishn\xcc\x81u in the form of Brahma; and there Vishn\xcc\x81u,\nthe lord of the universe, whose essence is inscrutable, assumed a perceptible\nform, and even he himself abided in it in the character of Brahma 31. Its\nwomb, vast as the mountain Meru, was composed of the mountains; and the mighty\noceans were the waters that filled its cavity. In that egg, O Brahman, were\nthe continents and seas and mountains, the planets and divisions of the\nuniverse, the gods, the demons, and mankind. And this egg was externally\ninvested by seven natural envelopes, or by water, air, fire, ether, and\nAhankara the origin of the elements, each tenfold the extent of that which it\ninvested; next came the principle of Intelligence; and, finally, the whole was\nsurrounded by the indiscrete Principle: resembling thus the cocoa-nut, filled\ninteriorly with pulp, and exteriorly covered by husk and rind.\n\nAffecting then the quality of activity, Hari, the lord of all, himself\nbecoming Brahma, engaged in the creation of the universe. Vishn\xcc\x81u with the\nquality of goodness, and of immeasurable power, preserves created things\nthrough successive ages, until the close of the period termed a Kalpa; when\nthe same mighty deity, Janarddana 32, invested with the quality of darkness,\nassumes the awful form of Rudra, and swallows up the universe. Having thus\ndevoured all things, and converted the world into one vast ocean, the Supreme\nreposes upon his mighty serpent couch amidst the deep: he awakes after a\nseason, and again, as Brahma, becomes the author of creation.\n\nThus the one only god, Janarddana, takes the designation of Brahma, Vishn\xcc\x81u,\nand \xc5\x9aiva, accordingly as he creates, preserves, or destroys 33.\n\np. 20\n\n[paragraph continues] Vishn\xcc\x81u as creator, creates himself; as preserver,\npreserves himself; as destroyer, destroys himself at the end of all things.\nThis world of earth, air, fire, water, ether, the senses, and the mind; all\nthat is termed spirit 34, that also is the lord of all elements, the universal\nform, and imperishable: hence he is the cause of creation, preservation, and\ndestruction; and the subject of the vicissitudes inherent in elementary nature\n35. He is the object and author of creation: he preserves, destroys, and is\npreserved. He, Vishn\xcc\x81u, as Brahma, and as all other beings, is infinite form:\nhe is the supreme, the giver of all good, the fountain of all happiness 36.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[7:1](vp036.htm#fr_114) The three hypostases of Vishn\xcc\x81u. Hiran\xcc\x81yagarbha is a\nname of Brahma; he who was born from the golden egg. Hari is Vishn\xcc\x81u, and\n\xc5\x9aankara Siva. The Vishn\xcc\x81u who is the subject of our text is the supreme being\nin all these three divinities or hypostases, in his different characters of\ncreator, preserver and destroyer. Thus in the Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya: \'Accordingly, as\nthe primal all-pervading spirit is distinguished by attributes in creation and\nthe rest, so he obtains the denomination of Brahma, Vishn\xcc\x81u, and \xc5\x9aiva. In the\ncapacity of Brahma he creates the worlds; in that of Rudra he destroys them;\nin that of Vishn\xcc\x81u he is quiescent. These are the three Avasthas (ht.\nhypostases) of the self-born. Brahma is the quality of activity; Rudra that of\ndarkness; Vishn\xcc\x81u, the lord of the world, is goodness: so, therefore, the\nthree gods are the three qualities. They are ever combined with, and dependent\nupon one another; and they are never for an instant separate; they never quit\neach other.\' The notion is one common to all antiquity, although less\nphilosophically conceived, or perhaps less distinctly expressed, in the\npassages which have come down to us. The \xcf\x84\xcf\x81\xce\xb5\xe1\xbf\x96\xcf\x82 \xe1\xbc\x80\xcf\x81\xcf\x87\xce\xb9\xce\xba\xe1\xbd\xb0\xcf\x82 \xe1\xbd\x91\xcf\x80\xce\xbf\xcf\x83\xcf\x84\xce\xac\xcf\x83\xce\xb5\xce\xb9\xcf\x82 of Plato are\nsaid by Cudworth (I. 111), upon the authority of Plotinus, to be an ancient\ndoctrine, \xcf\x80\xce\xb1\xce\xbb\xce\xb1\xce\xb9\xe1\xbd\xb0 \xce\xb4\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xbe\xce\xb1: and he also observes, "Orpheus, Pythagoras, and Plato\nhave all of them asserted a trinity of divine hypostases; and as they\nunquestionably derived much of their doctrine from the Egyptians, it may\nreasonably be suspected that the Egyptians did the like before them." As\nhowever the Grecian accounts, and those of the Egyptians, are much more\nperplexed and unsatisfactory than those of the Hindus, it is most probable\nthat we find amongst them the doctrine in its most original as well as most\nmethodical and significant form.\n\n[8:2](vp036.htm#fr_115) This address to Vishn\xcc\x81u pursues the notion that he, as\nthe supreme being, is one, whilst he is all: he is Avikara, not subject to\nchange; Sadaikarupa, one invariable nature: he is the liberator (tara), or he\nwho bears mortals across the ocean of existence: he is both single and\nmanifold (ekanekarupa): and he is the indiscrete (avyakta) cause of the world,\nas well as the discrete (vyakta) effect; or the invisible cause, and visible\ncreation.\n\n[8:3](vp036.htm#fr_116) Jaganmaya, made up, or consisting substantially of the\nworld. Maya is an affix denoting \'made\' or \'consisting of,\' as Kasht\xcc\x81ha maya,\n\'made of wood.\' The world is therefore not regarded by the Pauranics as an\nemanation or an illusion, but as consubstantial with its first cause.\n\n[8:4](vp036.htm#fr_117) An\xcc\x81iyansam an\xcc\x81iyasam, \'the most atomic of the atomic;\'\nalluding to the atomic theory of the Nyaya or logical school.\n\n[8:5](vp036.htm#fr_118) Or Achyuta; a common name of Vishn\xcc\x81u, from _a_ ,\nprivative, and chyuta, fallen; according to our comment, \'he who does not\nperish with created things.\' The Mahabharata interprets it in one place to\nmean, \'he who is not distinct from final emancipation;\' and in another to\nsignify, \'exempt from decay\'. A commentator on the Ka\xc5\x9bikhan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a of the Skanda\nPuran\xcc\x81a explains it, \'he who never declines (or varies) from his own proper\nnature.\'\n\n[8:6](vp036.htm#fr_119) This is another common title of Vishn\xcc\x81u, implying\nsupreme, best (Uttama), spirit (Purusha), or male, or sacrifice, or, according\nto the Mahabh. Moksha Dharma, whatever sense Purusha may bear.\n\n[8:7](vp036.htm#fr_120) Paramarthatas, \'by or through the real object, or\nsense; through actual truth.\'\n\n[8:8](vp036.htm#fr_121) Bhranti der\xc5\x9banatas, \'false appearances,\' in opposition\nto actual truth. \'By the nature of visible objects\': Artha is explained by\ndri\xc5\x9bya, \'visible;\' swarupena \'by the nature of:\' that is, visible objects are\nnot what they seem to be, independent existences; they are essentially one\nwith their original source: and knowledge of their true nature or relation to\nVishn\xcc\x81u, is knowledge of Vishn\xcc\x81u himself. This is not the doctrine of Maya, or\nthe influence of illusion, p. 9 which alone, according to Vedanta idealism,\nconstitutes belief in the existence of matter: a doctrine foreign to most of\nthe Puran\xcc\x81as, and first introduced amongst them apparently by the Bhagavata.\n\n[9:9](vp036.htm#fr_122) A different and more detailed account of the\ntransmission of the Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a is given in the last book, c. 8.\n\n[9:10](vp036.htm#fr_123) The ordinary derivation of Vasudeva has been noticed\nabove ([p. 1](vp035.htm#page_1)): here it is derived from Vas, \'to dwell,\'\nfrom Vishn\xcc\x81u\'s abiding in all things, and all in him. The Mahabharata explains\nVasu in the same manner, and Deva to signify radiant, shining: \'He causes all\nthings to dwell in him, and he abides in all; whence he is named Vasu: being\nresplendent as the sun, he is called Deva: and he who is both these, is\ndenominated Vasudeva.\' See also b. VI. c. 5.\n\n[9:11](vp036.htm#fr_124) The commentator argues that Vasudeva must be the\nBrahma, or supreme being, of the Vedas, because the same circumstances are\npredicated of both, as eternity, omnipresence, omnipotence, &c.; but he does\nnot adduce any scriptural text with the name Vasudeva.\n\n[9:12](vp036.htm#fr_125) Time is not usually enumerated in the Puran\xcc\x81as as an\nelement of the first cause, but the Padma P. and the Bhagavata p. 10 agree\nwith the Vishn\xcc\x81u in including it. It appears to have been regarded at an\nearlier date as an independent cause: the commentator on the Moksha Dherma\ncites a passage from the Vedas, which he understands to allude to the\ndifferent theories of the cause of creation. Time, inherent nature,\nconsequence of acts, self-will, elementary atoms, matter, and spirit, asserted\nseverally by the Astrologers, the Buddhists, the Mimansakas, the Jains, the\nLogicians, the Sankhyas, and the Vedantis. \xce\x9a\xcf\x81\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xbd\xce\xbf\xcf\x82 was also one of the first\ngenerated agents in creation, according to the Orphic theogony.\n\n[10:13](vp036.htm#fr_126) The creation of the world is very commonly\nconsidered to be the Lila, sport or amusement, of the Supreme Being.\n\n[10:14](vp036.htm#fr_127) The attributes of Pradhana, the chief (principle or\nelement), here specified, conform generally to those ascribed to it by the\nSankhya philosophy (Sankhya Karika, p. 16, &c.), although some of them are\nincompatible with its origin from a first cause. In the Sankhya this\nincongruity does not occur; for there Pradhana is independent, and coordinate\nwith primary spirit. The Puran\xcc\x81as give rise to the inconsistency by a lax use\nof both philosophical and pantheistical expressions. The most incongruous\nepithets in our text are however explained away in the comment. Thus nitya,\n\'eternal,\' is said to mean \'uniform, not liable to increase or diminution:\'\nSadasadatmaka, \'comprehending what is and what is not,\' means \'having the\npower of both cause and effect\', as proceeding from Vishn\xcc\x81u, and as giving\norigin to material things. Anadi, \'without beginning,\' means \'without birth\',\nnot being engendered by any created thing, but proceeding immediately from the\nfirst cause. \'The mother,\' or literally the womb of the world\', means the\npassive agent in creation,\' operated on or influenced by the active will of\nthe Creator. The first part of the passage in the text is a favourite one with\nseveral of. the Puran\xcc\x81as, but they modify it and apply it after their own\nfashion. In the Vishn\xcc\x81u the original is ###, rendered as above. The Vayu,\nBrahmanda, and p. 11 Kurmma Puran\xcc\x81as have \'The indiscrete cause, which is\nuniform, and both cause and effect, and whom those who are acquainted with\nfirst principles call Pradhana and Prakriti--is the uncognizable Brahma, who\nwas before all.\' But the application of two synonymes of Prakriti to Brahma\nseems unnecessary at least. The Brahma P. corrects the reading apparently: the\nfirst line is as before; the second is, ###. The passage is placed absolutely;\n\'There was an indiscrete cause eternal, and cause and effect, which was both\nmatter and spirit (Pradhana and Purusha), from which this world was made.\nInstead of \'such\' or this,\' some copies read \'from which \xc3\x8d\xc5\x9bwara or god (the\nactive deity or Brahma) made the world.\' The Hari Van\xc5\x9ba has the same reading,\nexcept in the last term, which it makes ### that is, according to the\ncommentator, the world, which is \xc3\x8d\xc5\x9bwara, was made.\' The same authority\nexplains this indiscrete cause, avyakta karana, to denote Brahma, the creator\nan identification very unusual, if not inaccurate, and possibly founded on\nmisapprehension of what is stated by the Bhavishya P.: \'That male or spirit\nwhich is endowed with that which is the indiscrete cause, &c. is known in the\nworld as Brahma: he being in the egg, &c.\' The passage is precisely the same\nin Manu, I, 11; except that we have \'visrishta\' instead of \'vi\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha:\' the\nlatter is a questionable reading, and is probably wrong: the sense of the\nlatter is, detached; and the whole means very consistently, \'embodied spirit\ndetached from the indiscrete cause of the world is known as Brahma.\' The Padma\nP. inserts the first line, ### &c., but has \'Which creates undoubtedly Mahat\nand the other qualities\' assigning the first epithets, therefore, as the\nVishn\xcc\x81u does, to Prakriti only. The Linga also refers the expression to\nPrakriti alone, but makes it a secondary cause: \'An indiscrete cause, which\nthose acquainted with first principles call Pradhana and Prakriti, proceeded\nfrom that \xc3\x8d\xc5\x9bwara (\xc5\x9aiva).\' This passage is one of very many instances in which\nexpressions are common to several Puran\xcc\x81as that seem to be borrowed from one\nanother, or from some common source older than any of them, especially in this\ninstance, as the same text occurs in Manu.\n\n[11:15](vp036.htm#fr_128) The expression of the text is rather obscure; \'All\nwas pervaded (or comprehended) by that chief principle before (recreation),\nafter the (last) destruction.\' The ellipses are filled up by the commentator.\nThis, he adds, is to be regarded as the state of things at a Maha Pralaya, or\ntotal dissolution; leaving, therefore, crude matter, nature, or chaos, as a\ncoexistent element with the Supreme. This, which is conformable to the\nphilosophical doctrine, is not however that of the Puran\xcc\x81as in general, nor p.\n12 that of our text, which states (b. VI. c. 4), that at a Prakrita, or\nelementary dissolution, Pradhana itself merges into the deity. Neither is it\napparently the doctrine of the Vedas, although their language is somewhat\nequivocal.\n\n[12:16](vp036.htm#fr_129) The metre here is one common to the Vedas,\nTrishtubh, but in other respects the language is not characteristic of those\ncompositions. The purport of the passage is rendered somewhat doubtful by its\nclose, and by the explanation of the commentator. The former is, \'One\nPradhanika Brahma Spirit: THAT, was. The commentator explains Pradhanika,\nPradhana eva, the same word as Pradhana; but it is a derivative word, which\nmay be used attributively, implying \'having, or conjoined with, Pradhana.\' The\ncommentator, however, interprets it as the substantive; for he adds, \'There\nwas Pradhana and Brahma and Spirit; this triad was at the period of\ndissolution.\' He evidently, however, understands their conjoint existence as\none only; for he continues, \'So, according to the Vedas, then there was\nneither the existent (invisible cause, or matter) nor the non-existent\n(visible effect, or creation),\' meaning that there was only One Being, in whom\nmatter and its modifications were all comprehended.\n\n[12:17](vp036.htm#fr_130) Or it might be rendered, \'Those two other forms\n(which proceed) from his supreme nature;\' that is, from the nature of Vishn\xcc\x81u,\nwhen he is Nirupadhi, or without adventitious attributes: ### \'other\' (###);\nthe commentator states they are other or separate from Vishn\xcc\x81u only through\nMaya, illusion,\' but here implying false notion;\' the elements of creation\nbeing in essence one with Vishn\xcc\x81u, though in existence detached and different.\n\n[12:18](vp036.htm#fr_131) Pradhana, when unmodified, is, according to the\nSankhyas and Pauran\xcc\x81ics, nothing more than the three qualities in equilibrio,\nor goodness, foulness, and darkness neutralising each other; (Sankhya p. 13\nKarika, p. 52;) so in the Matsya P.: ###. This state is synonymous with the\nnon-evolution of material products, or with dissolution; implying, however,\nseparate existence, and detached from spirit This being the case, it is asked\nwho. should sustain matter and spirit whilst separate, or renew their\ncombination so as to renovate creation? It is answered, Time, which is when\nevery thing else is not; and which, at the end of a certain interval, unites\nMatter, Pradhana, and Purusha, and produces creation. Conceptions of this kind\nare evidently comprised in the Orphic triad, or the ancient notion of the\ncooperation of three such principles in creation; as Phanes or Eros, which is\nthe Hindu spirit or Purusha; Chaos, matter or Pradhana; and Chronos, or Kala,\ntime.\n\n[13:19](vp036.htm#fr_132) Pradhana is styled Vyaya \'that which may be\nexpended;\' or Parin\xcc\x81amin, \'which may be modified:\' and Purusha is called\nAvyaya, \'inconsumable; or aparina.min, \'immutable.\' The expressions \'having\nentered into,\' and \'agitated,\' recall the mode in which divine intelligence,\nmens, \xce\xbd\xce\xbf\xe1\xbf\xa6\xcf\x82, was conceived by the ancients to operate upon matter:\n\n\xce\xa6\xcf\x81\xe1\xbd\xb4\xce\xbd . . . \xcf\x86\xcf\x81\xce\xbf\xce\xbd\xcf\x84\xce\xaf\xcf\x83\xce\xb9 \xce\xba\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x83\xce\xbc\xce\xbf\xce\xbd \xe1\xbc\x83\xcf\x80\xce\xb1\xce\xbd\xcf\x84\xce\xb1  \n. . . . \xce\xba\xce\xb1\xcf\x84\xce\xb1\xce\x90\xcf\x83\xcf\x83\xce\xbf\xcf\x85\xcf\x83\xce\xb1 \xce\xb8\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xb7\xcf\x83\xce\xb9\xce\xbd:\n\nor as in a more familiar passage;\n\nSpiritus intus alit totamque infusa per artus  \nMens agitat molem et magno se corpore miscet:\n\nor perhaps it more closely approximates to the Phoenician cosmogony, in which\na spirit mixing with its own principles gives rise to creation. Brucker, I.\n240. As presently explained, the mixture is not mechanical; it is an influence\nor effect exerted upon intermediate agents, which produce effects; as perfumes\ndo not delight the mind by actual contact, but by the impression they make\nupon the sense of smelling, which communicates it to the mind. The entrance of\nthe supreme Vishn\xcc\x81u into spirit as well as matter is less intelligible than\nthe view elsewhere taken of it, as the infusion of spirit, identified with the\nSupreme, into Prakriti or matter alone. Thus in the Padma Puran\xcc\x81a: \'He who is\ncalled the male (spirit) of Prakriti, is here named Achyuta; and that same\ndivine Vishn\xcc\x81u entered into Prakriti.\' So the Vrihat Naradiya: \'The lord of\nthe world, who is called Purusha, producing agitation in Prakriti.\' From the\nnotion of influence or agitation produced on matter through or with spirit,\nthe abuse of personification led to actual or vicarious admixture. Thus the\nBhagavata, identifying Maya with Prakriti, has, p. 14 \'Through the operation\nof time, the Mighty One, who is present to the pure, implanted a seed in Maya\nendowed with qualities, as Purusha, which is one with himself.\' B. III. s.5.\nAnd the Bhavishya: \'Some learned men say, that the Supreme Being, desirous to\ncreate beings, creates in the commencement of the Kalpa a body of soul (or an\nincorporeal substance); which soul created by him enters into Prakriti; and\nPrakriti being thereby agitated, creates many material elements.\' But these\nmay be regarded as notions of a later date. In the Mahabharata the first cause\nis declared to be \'Intellectual,\' who creates by his mind or will: The first\n(Being) is called Manasa (intellectual), and is so celebrated by great sages:\nhe is God, without beginning or end, indivisible, immortal, undecaying.\' And\nagain: \'The Intellectual created many kinds of creatures by his mind.\'\n\n[14:20](vp036.htm#fr_133) Contraction, Sankocha, is explained by Samya,\nsameness or equilibrium of the three qualities, or inert Pradhana: and\nExpansion, Vika\xc5\x9ba, is the destruction of this equipoise, by previous agitation\nand consequent developement of material products.\n\n[14:21](vp036.htm#fr_134) The term here is Kshetrajna, \'embodied spirit,\' or\nthat which knows the kshetra or \'body;\' implying the combination of spirit\nwith form or matter, for the purpose of creating.\n\n[14:22](vp036.htm#fr_135) The first product of Pradhana sensible to divine,\nthough not to mere human organs, is, both according to the Sankhya and\nPauran\xcc\x81ic doctrines, the principle called Mahat, literally \'the Great,\'\nexplained in other places, as in our text, \'the production of the\nmanifestation of the qualities:\' or, as in the Vayu, ###. We have in the same\nPuran\xcc\x81a, as well as in the Brahman\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a and Linga, a number of synonymes for\nthis term, as, ###. They are also explained, though not very distinctly, to\nthe following purport: "Manas is that which considers the consequences of acts\nto all creatures, and provides for their happiness. Mahat, the Great\nprinciple, is so termed from being the first of the created principles, and\nfrom its extension being greater than that of the rest. Mati is that which\ndiscriminates and distinguishes objects preparatory to their fruition by Soul.\nBrahma implies that which effects the developement and augmentation of created\nthings. Pur p. 15 is that by which the concurrence of nature occupies and\nfills all bodies. Buddhi is that which communicates to soul the knowledge of\ngood and evil. Khyati is the means of individual fruition, or the faculty of\ndiscriminating objects by appropriate designations, and the like. \xc3\x8d\xc5\x9bwara is\nthat which knows all things as if they were present. Prajna is that by which\nthe properties of things are known. Chiti is that by which the consequences of\nacts and species of knowledge are selected for the use of soul. Smriti is the\nfaculty of recognising all things, past, present, or to come. Samvit is that\nin which all things are found or known, and which is found or known in all\nthings: and Vipura is that which is free from the effects of contrarieties, as\nof knowledge and ignorance, and the like. Mahat is also called \xc3\x8d\xc5\x9bwara, from\nits exercising supremacy over all things; Bhava, from its elementary\nexistence; Eka, or \'the one,\' from its singleness; Purusha, from its abiding\nwithin the body; and from its being ungenerated it is called Swayambhu." Now\nin this nomenclature we have chiefly two sets of words; one, as Manas, Buddhi,\nMati, signifying mind, intelligence, knowledge, wisdom, design; and the other,\nas Brahma, \xc3\x8d\xc5\x9bwara, &c., denoting an active creator and ruler of the universe:\nas the Vayu adds, \'Mahat, impelled by the desire to create, causes various\ncreation:\' and the Mahabharata has, \'Mahat created Ahankara.\' The Puran\xcc\x81as\ngenerally employ the same expression, attributing to Mahat or Intelligence the\n\'act of creating. Mahat is therefore the divine mind in creative operation,\nthe \xce\xbd\xce\xbf\xe1\xbf\xa6\xcf\x82 \xe1\xbd\x81 \xce\xb4\xce\xb9\xce\xb1\xce\xba\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x83\xce\xbc\xcf\x89\xce\xbd \xcf\x84\xce\xb5 \xce\xba\xce\xb1\xe1\xbd\xb6 \xcf\x80\xce\xac\xce\xbd\xcf\x84\xcf\x89\xce\xbd \xe1\xbc\x80\xce\xaf\xcf\x84\xce\xb9\xce\xbf\xcf\x82 of Anaxagoras; an ordering and\ndisposing mind, which was the cause of all things: The word itself suggests\nsome relationship to the Phoenician Mot, which, like Mahat, was the first\nproduct of the mixture of spirit and matter, and the first rudiment of\ncreation: "Ex connexione autem ejus spiritus prodiit mot . . . hinc seminium\nomnis creaturae et omnium rerum creatio." Brucker, I. 240. Mot, it is true, .\nappears to be a purely material substance, whilst Mahat is an incorporeal\nsubstance; but they agree in their place in the cosmogony, and are something\nalike in name. How far also the Phoenician system has been accurately\ndescribed, is matter of uncertainty. See Sankhya Karika, p. 83.\n\n[15:23](vp036.htm#fr_136) The sense of Ahankara cannot be very well rendered\nby any European term. It means the principle of individual existence, that\nwhich appropriates perceptions, and on which depend the notions, I think, I\nfeel, I am. It might be expressed by the proposition of Descartes reversed;\n"Sum, ergo cogito, sentio," &c. The equivalent employed by Mr. Colebrooke,\negotism, has the advantage of an analogous etymology, Ahankara being derived\nfrom Aham, \'I;\' as in the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba: \'He (Brahma), oh Bharata, said, _I_ will\ncreate creatures.\' See also S. Karika, p. 91.\n\n[16:24](vp036.htm#fr_137) These three varieties of Ahankara are also described\nin the Sankhya Karika, p. 92. Vaikarika, that which is productive, or\nsusceptible of production, is the same as the Satwika, or that which is\ncombined with the property of goodness. Taijasa Ahankara is that which is\nendowed with Tejas, heat\' or energy,\' in [consequence](errata.htm#1) of its\nhaving the property of Rajas, \'passion\' or \'activity;\' and the third kind,\nBhutadi, or \'elementary,\' is the Tamasa, or has the property of darkness. From\nthe first kind proceed the senses; from the last, the rudimental unconscious\nelements; both kinds, which are equally of themselves inert, being rendered\nproductive by the cooperation of the second, the energetic or active\nmodification of Ahankara, which is therefore said to be the origin of both the\nsenses and the elements.\n\n[16:25](vp036.htm#fr_138) The successive series of rudiments and elements, and\ntheir respectively engendering the rudiments and elements next in order, occur\nin most of the Puran\xcc\x81as, in nearly the same words. The Vrihannaradiya P.\nobserves, \'They (the elements) in successive order acquire the property of\ncausality one to the other.\' The order is also the same; or, ether (akas),\nwind or air (vayu), fire or light (tejas), water and earth; except in one\npassage of the Mahabharata (Moksha Dherma, C. 9), where it is ether, water,\nfire, air, earth. The order of Empedocles was ether, fire, earth, water, air.\nCudworth, I. 97. The investment (avaran\xcc\x81a) of each element by its own\nrudiment, and of each rudiment by its preceding gross and rudimental elements,\nis also met with in most of the chief Puran\xcc\x81as, as the Vayu, Padma, Linga, and\nBhagavata; and traces p. 17 of it are found amongst the ancient cosmogonists;\nfor Anaximander supposed, that when the world was made, a certain sphere or\nflame of fire, separated from matter (the Infinite), encompassed the air,\nwhich invested the earth as the bark does a tree:\' \xce\x9a\xce\xb1\xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb0 \xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb4\xce\xbd \xce\xb3\xe1\xbd\xb3\xce\xbd\xce\xb5\xcf\x83\xce\xb9\xce\xbd \xcf\x84\xce\xbf\xe1\xbf\xa6\xce\xb4\xce\xb5 \xcf\x84\xce\xbf\xe1\xbf\xa6\n\xce\xba\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x83\xce\xbc\xce\xbf\xcf\x85 \xe1\xbc\x80\xcf\x80\xce\xbf\xce\xba\xcf\x81\xce\xb9\xce\xb8\xe1\xbf\x86\xce\xbd\xce\xb1\xce\xb9, \xce\xba\xce\xb1\xce\xaf \xcf\x84\xce\xb9\xce\xbd\xce\xb1 \xe1\xbc\x91\xce\xba \xcf\x84\xce\xbf\xe1\xbd\xbb\xcf\x84\xce\xbf\xcf\x85 \xcf\x86\xce\xbb\xce\xbf\xce\xb3\xe1\xbd\xb8\xcf\x82 \xcf\x83\xcf\x80\xce\xb1\xe1\xbf\x96\xcf\x81\xce\xb1\xce\xbd \xcf\x80\xce\xb5\xcf\x81\xce\xb9\xcf\x86\xcf\x85\xe1\xbf\x86\xce\xbd\xce\xb1\xce\xb9 \xcf\x84\xe1\xbf\xb7 \xcf\x80\xce\xb5\xcf\x81\xe1\xbd\xb6 \xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb4\xce\xbd\n\xce\xb3\xe1\xbf\x86\xce\xbd \xe1\xbc\x84\xce\xb5\xcf\x81\xce\xb9, \xe1\xbd\xa1\xcf\x82 \xcf\x84\xe1\xbf\xb7 \xce\xb4\xe1\xbd\xb3\xce\xbd\xce\xb4\xcf\x81\xe1\xbf\xb3 \xcf\x86\xce\xbb\xce\xbf\xce\xb9\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xbd. Euseb. Pr, I. 15. Some of the Puran\xcc\x81as, as the\nMatsya, Vayu, Linga, Bhagavata, and Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya, add a description of a\nparticipation of properties amongst the elements, which is rather Vedanta than\nSankhya. According to this notion, the elements add to their characteristic\nproperties those of the elements which precede them. \xc3\x81kas has the single\nproperty of sound: air has those of touch and sound: fire has colour, touch,\nand sound: water has taste, colour, touch, and sound: and earth has smell and\nthe rest, thus having five properties: or, as the Linga P. describes the\nseries, ###.\n\n[17:26](vp036.htm#fr_139) Tanmatra, \'rudiment\' or \'type,\' from Tad, \'that,\'\nfor Tasmin, \'in that\' gross element, and matra, \'subtile or rudimental form\'.\nThe rudiments are also the characteristic properties of the elements: as the\nBhagavata; \'The rudiment of it (ether) is also its quality, sound; as a common\ndesignation may denote both a person who sees an object, and the object which\nis to be seen: that is, according to the commentator, suppose a person behind\na wall called aloud, "An elephant! an elephant!" the term would equally\nindicate that an elephant was visible, and that somebody saw it. Bhag. II. 5.\n\n[17:27](vp036.htm#fr_140) The properties here alluded to are not those of\ngoodness &c., but other properties assigned to perceptible objects by the\nSankhya doctrines, or \xc5\x9aanti, \'placidity;\' Ghorata, \'terror;\' and Moha,\n\'dulness\' or \'stupefaction.\' S. Karika, V.38. p, 119.\n\n[17:28](vp036.htm#fr_141) The Bhagavata, which gives a similar statement of\nthe origin of the elements, senses, and divinities, specifies the last to be\nDi\xc5\x9b (space), air, the sun, Prachetas, the Aswins, fire, Indra, Upendra, Mitra,\nand Ka or Prajapati, presiding over the senses, according to the comment, or\nseverally over the ear, skin, eye, tongue, nose, speech, hands, feet, and\nexcretory and generative organs. Bhag. II. 5. 31.\n\n[18:29](vp036.htm#fr_142) Avyaktanugrahen\xcc\x81a. The expression is something\nequivocal, as Avyakta may here apply either to the First Cause or to matter.\nIn either case the notion is the same, and the aggregation of the elements is\nthe effect of the presidence of spirit, without any active interference of the\nindiscrete principle. The Avyakta is passive in the evolution and combination\nof Mahat and the rest. Pradhana is, no doubt, intended, but its identification\nwith the Supreme is also implied. The term Anugraha may also refer to a\nclassification of the order of creation, which will be again adverted to.\n\n[18:30](vp036.htm#fr_143) It is impossible not to refer this notion to the\nsame origin as the widely diffused opinion of antiquity, of the first\nmanifestation of the world in the form of an egg. "It seems to have been a\nfavourite symbol, and very ancient, and we find it adopted among many\nnations." Bryant, III. 165. Traces of it occur amongst the Syrians, Persians,\nand Egyptians; and besides the Orphic egg amongst the Greeks, and that\ndescribed by Aristophanes, \xce\xa4\xe1\xbd\xb3\xce\xba\xcf\x84\xce\xb5\xce\xbd \xcf\x80\xcf\x81\xe1\xbd\xbd\xcf\x84\xce\xb9\xcf\x83\xcf\x84\xce\xbf\xce\xbd \xe1\xbd\x91\xcf\x80\xce\xb7\xce\xbd\xe1\xbd\xb3\xce\xbc\xce\xb9\xce\xbf\xce\xbd \xce\xbd\xe1\xbd\xba\xce\xbe \xe1\xbc\xa1 \xce\xbc\xce\xb5\xce\xbb\xce\xb1\xce\xbd\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x80\xcf\x84\xce\xb5\xcf\x81\xce\xbf\xcf\x82 \xe1\xbd\xa0\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xbd\npart of the ceremony in the Dionysiaca and other mysteries consisted of the\nconsecration of an egg; by which, according to Porphyry, was signified the\nworld: \xe1\xbc\x99\xcf\x81\xce\xbc\xce\xb7\xce\xbd\xce\xb5\xe1\xbd\xba\xce\xb5\xce\xb9 \xce\xb4\xe1\xbd\xb2 \xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb8 \xe1\xbd\xa0\xe1\xbd\xb8\xce\xbd \xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb8\xce\xbd \xce\xba\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x83\xce\xbc\xce\xbf\xce\xbd. Whether this egg typified the ark, as\nBryant and Faber suppose, is not material to the proof of the antiquity and\nwide diffusion of the belief that the world in the beginning existed in such a\nfigure. A similar account of the first aggregation of the elements in the form\nof an egg is given in all the Puran\xcc\x81as, with the usual epithet Haima or\nHiranya, \'golden,\' as it occurs in Manu, I. 9.\n\n[19:31](vp036.htm#fr_144) Here is another analogy to the doctrines of\nantiquity relating to the mundane egg: and as the first visible male being,\nwho, as we shall hereafter see, united in himself the nature of either sex,\nabode in the egg, and issued from it; so "this firstborn of the world, whom\nthey represented under two shapes and characters, and who sprung from the\nmundane egg, was the person from whom the mortals and immortals were derived.\nHe was the same as Dionusus, whom they styled, \xcf\x80\xcf\x81\xcf\x89\xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xb3\xce\xbf\xce\xbd\xce\xbf\xce\xbd \xce\xb4\xce\xb9\xcf\x86\xce\xbd\xe1\xbf\x86 \xcf\x84\xcf\x81\xce\xaf\xce\xb3\xce\xbf\xce\xbd\xce\xbf\xce\xbd\n\xce\x92\xce\xb1\xce\xba\xcf\x87\xce\xb5\xe1\xbf\x96\xce\xbf\xce\xbd \xe1\xbc\x8c\xce\xbd\xce\xb1\xce\xba\xcf\x84\xce\xb1 \xe1\xbc\x8c\xce\xb3\xcf\x81\xce\xb9\xce\xbf\xce\xbd \xe1\xbc\x80\xcf\x81\xcf\x81\xce\xb7\xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb8\xce\xbd \xce\xba\xcf\x81\xe1\xbd\xbb\xcf\x86\xce\xb9\xce\xbf\xce\xbd \xce\xb4\xce\xb9\xce\xba\xe1\xbd\xb3\xcf\x81\xcf\x89\xcf\x84\xce\xb1 \xce\xb4\xce\xaf\xce\xbc\xce\xbf\xcf\x86\xce\xbf\xce\xbd:" or, with the\nomission of one epithet, , ###.\n\n[19:32](vp036.htm#fr_145) Janarddana is derived from Jana, \'men,\' and Arddana,\n\'worship;\' \'the object of adoration to mankind.\'\n\n[19:33](vp036.htm#fr_146) This is the invariable doctrine of the Puran\xcc\x81as,\ndiversified only according to the p. 20 individual divinity to whom they\nascribe identity with Paramatma or Parame\xc5\x9bwara. In our text this is Vishn\xcc\x81u:\nin the \xc5\x9aaiva Puran\xcc\x81as, as in the Linga, it is \xc5\x9aiva: in the Brahma-vaivartta it\nis Krishn\xcc\x81a. The identification of one of the hypostases with the common\nsource of the triad was an incongruity not unknown to other theogonies; for\nCneph, amongst the Egyptians, appears on the one hand to have been identified\nwith the Supreme Being, the indivisible unity, whilst on the other he is\nconfounded with both Emeph and Ptha, the second and third persons of the triad\nof hypostases.
