Janamejaya said :-- \xc2\x93O Muni! How did Mahar _s_ i Chyavana make these twin\nDevas drink Soma and how his words came out to be true. Human strength is\ninsignificant compared to Indra's strength. Indra forbade the physicians, the\nAs'vins, to drink the Soma juice. How then could the Muni give the right\nthereof. This is very wonderful. Therefore, O Thou, devoted to Dharma! O Lord!\nDescribe in detail the doings of this Mahar _s_ i Chyavana. I am very anxious\nto hear it.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n4-10. Vyasa said :-- O King! In that famous sacrifice of the King S\xc2\x92aryati,\nChyavana Ri _s_ i did wonderful feats. O Bharata! I am now\n\n\n\np. 613\n\n\n\nnarrating to you his entirely wonderful character. Hear it attentively. Mahar\n_s_ i Chyavana, illustrious like the Devas, began to enjoy with a cheerful\nmind and gladdened heart, with his beautiful wife Sukanya who was like a Deva\nKanya. Now, once on an occasion, the wife of S'aryati became very anxious and\ntrembling said to her husband weeping :-- \xc2\x93O King! You have betrothed your\ndaughter to the blind Muni Chyavana; now it is your duty to go and enquire\nwhether the daughter is living or is dead. O Lord! What is my beautiful\ndaughter doing with that husband. Please go just now to the Muni's \xc3\x82s'rama and\nsee about it. O Rajar _s_ i! I always burn in pain and agony when I think of\nher. She must have become very lean and thin due to the troubles of Tapasya;\nplease bring her quickly here to my presence. She is suffering an everlasting\npain from having an aged blind husband; and it is quite likely she has become\nvery lean and thin, I am anxious, therefore, to see my daughter lean and thin\nwho is wearing barks of trees as her dress.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n11\\. S'aryati said :-- \xc2\x93O broad-eyed One! I am going gladly just now to see my\ndear daughter and that Muni of severe vows.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n12-25. Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus saying to his wife, distressed with sorrow,\nthe King S'aryati mounted on his chariot and quickly went towards the \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92rama\nof the Chyavana Muni. On reaching there, he saw the Mahar _s_ i Chyavana like\na Deva's son. Seeing his body like that of Deva, the King became bewildered\nand began to think thus :-- \xc2\x93What! Has my daughter done such an ugly act,\nblameable in the society! That Muni was very calm and quiet, penniless and\nvery old; my daughter, perhaps, being overpowered with passion, killed him and\nhas taken, no doubt, another husband. It is indeed difficult to control the\nGod of Love, armed with his flowery bow: the period of youth is moreover very\nhard to conquer. So this daughter impelled by lust has thrown a dreadful\nstigma on the clear name of the family of the great Manu. Fie on him whose\ndaughter in this world is of a vicious character! It seems that daughters are\nborn for the expiation of all the sins committed by their fathers. But what an\nunjust act have I committed for my own selfish ends? It is highly incumbent on\nevery father to betroth his daughter with every care possible to a bridegroom\nsuitable in every respect; but I did not do it and now have got the fruits\nequivalent to my doing. If I kill my daughter, vicious and unchaste, I will\nincur sin due to killing a woman and moreover my daughter. I am the cause of\nthis stain on Muni's line of descent. On the one hand, the scandal on one is\nvery powerful; and the affection for a daughter is strong on\n\n\n\np. 614\n\n\n\nthe other. What am I to do now?\xc2\x94 The King became merged in deep thoughts. At\nthis time Sukanya accidentally saw her father thus drowned in anxious\nthoughts. Seeing him, Sukanya instantly came to her father's side and asked\nthe King in sweet affectionate words. O King! How is it that your face has\nbecome so pale with anxious thoughts, seeing the Muni sitting in front of you,\na young man with lotus-eyes. O Father! What are you thinking? You belong to\nthe famous Manu's family; besides, you are a high-minded man; you ought not to\nbe sad so suddenly; come quickly and bow your head down before my husband.\n\n\n\n26\\. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing thus the daughter's words, the King became\nimpatient with anger and began to speak to her :--\n\n\n\n27-36. O Daughter! Where is that aged blind ascetic Muni Chyavana and who is\nthis youth intoxicated with lust? A great doubt has arisen in my mind. O\nVicious Soul! Have you slain that Chyavana Muni and engaged yourself in such a\nsinful act? O You, a Disgrace to your family! Have you accepted another\nhusband out of your desire of lust? My mind has became very much troubled on\nnot seeing that Muni in this \xc3\x82s'rama. O vicious One! Now I don't see the Muni;\nbut instead of him, I see this bright person. And thus it is on account of\nyour sinful behaviour that my mind is drowned in the ocean of cares. Then\nhearing her father's words, Sukanya smiled and gladly took him at once to her\nhusband and said :-- \xc2\x93O Father! He is your son-in-law; He is the same Chyavana\nMuni; there is no doubt here. The twin As'vins have given him this beautiful\nlustre and lotus-like eyes. The two As'vini Kumaras came accidentally to my\n\xc3\x82srama and out of mercy no doubt they have made Chyavana such a nice young\nman. O King! I am not your that daughter that will do a vicious act as you\nthink, beguiled by this beautiful form of the Muni. Father! Bow down before\nthe Chyavana Muni. Ask him and he will tell you everything.\xc2\x94 Hearing thus the\ndaughter's words, the King went instantly to the Muni and bowed down before\nhim and asked him affectionately thus :--\n\n\n\n37-38. The King said :-- \xc2\x93O Son of Bhrigu! How have you got your eyes back?\nWhere has your old age gone? Kindly narrate all your details as early as\npossible. O Brahma _n_ a! Seeing your exquisitely beautiful form, a great\ndoubt has arisen in me; so tell me everything in detail; I will be very glad,\nno doubt.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n39-45. Chyavana said :-- \xc2\x93O King! The two As'vins, the physicians of the Gods,\ncame here on their own account and have done me\n\n\n\np. 615\n\n\n\nthis good out of their mercy. Owing to the benefit thus received, I have\ngranted them the boon that I will make them drink the Soma juice in the Agni\n_st_ oma Yaj\xc3\xb1a of the King S'aryati. Thus I have got these beautiful eyes and\nthe new youth; therefore, O King! Collect yourself and sit in the holy\nsacrificial seat.\xc2\x94 When the Brahmi _n_ Chyavana Muni spoke thus, the King\nS'aryati and his dear wife sat with greatest pleasure and began to talk on\nauspicious topics with the high-souled Muni. Then the Bhargava consoled the\nKing and said I will perform your sacrifice; please collect all the necessary\nmaterials. I have promised to the As'vins that certainly I will make them\ndrink the Soma juice. Therefore, O King! I will have to carry that out in your\nsacrifice. O King! If Indra be angry, I will stop him by my Tapas force and in\nthe Agni _st_ oma Yaj\xc3\xb1a I will make the As'vins drink Soma.\n\n\n\n46-58. Vyasa said :-- O King! S'aryati, the lord of the earth, then gladly\napproved the proposals of Chyavana Muni. The King then shewed respects to the\nMuni and, with a pleasant attitude of mind, returned to his city with his\nwife, all the while talking of the Muni on the way. On a good auspicious day\nhe, possessed of enormous wealth and prosperity prepared an excellent place\nfor the performance of the sacrifice. The Muni Chyavana then invited Vas'i\n_st_ ha and other respectable Munis and initiated the King S'aryati for the\nperformance of the sacrifice. At the commencement of the sacrifice, Indra and\nthe other Devas and the two As'vins all came to the sacrifice to drink Soma.\nSeeing the As'vins, Indra became afraid and asked the other Devas, \xc2\x93Why have\nthe As'vins come here?\xc2\x94 They are the physicians and, therefore, never fit to\ndrink Soma. Who has brought them hither at this great Agni _st_ oma Sacrifice?\nThe Devas remained all silent. Chyavana Muni then became ready to offer Soma\nto the As'vins and Indra immediately stopped him saying :-- They are already\nprohibited to drink Soma as a sacrificial share; so do not accept the vessel\nof Soma for them. Chyavana then said :-- \xc2\x93O Lord of S'achi! These are the\nSurya's sons; tell, then, truly why these are rendered unfit to drink Soma.\nThey are not of mixed blood; they are born of the legal wife of Surya Deva. O\nLord of the Devas! What is the fault then, of the As'vins, the physicians,\nthat they be prohibited to drink Soma juice. Please reply. O Indra! This point\nmust be settled by all the Devas here. I have promised to make them drink the\nSoma juice in this sacrifice. To keep my word I have initiated the King in\nthis sacrifice. I will have my word fulfilled; there is no doubt in this. O\nIndra! They have given me my youth and bestowed my eyes and have done me great\ngood. I will also do good to them to my best.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\np. 616\n\n\n\n59\\. Indra said :-- \xc2\x93The Devas have appointed these Devas their Physicians;\ntherefore they are looked down upon in the society; so they are unfit to drink\nSoma. You need not make them drink Soma.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n60-61. Chyavana spoke :-- \xc2\x93O Indra! You have adulterated yourself with Ahalya;\nwhy are you, then, giving vent to your anger thus in vain. You have\ntreacherously murdered Vritrasura; it is quite inappropriate for a vicious\nperson like you to say that the As'vins cannot have the right to drink Soma.\nThis is quite impossible.\xc2\x94 O King! On the springing of this dispute, no body\nspoke to Indra. The illustrious Bhargava, then, made them accept the Soma\njuice.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Sixth Chapter of the Seventh Book on granting the As'vins the\nright to drink the Soma juice in S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, the Maha Pura _n_\nam, of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 7](bk07ch07.htm)\n\n"
