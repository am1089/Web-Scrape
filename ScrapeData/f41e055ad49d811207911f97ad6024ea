 \nThe praises go like Suras on their way;  \nAll the sons of immortality hear (it),  \nWho have achieved dwellings divine.  \nf He whose advance others followed,  \nGods, of the god praising might,  \nHe who meted out the regions of earth,  \nHe is the brilliant god Savitr in greatness.  \ng O god Savitr, instigate the sacrifice, instigate the lord of the sacrifice\n[2] to good luck; may the divine Gandharva, who purifieth thoughts purify our\nthought; may the lord of speech to-day make sweet our utterance.  \nh This sacrifice for us, O god Savitr  \nDo thou instigate, serving the gods,  \nFinding comrades, ever victorious,  \nWinning booty, winning heaven.  \ni By the Rc make the Stoma to prosper,  \nBy the Gayatra the Rathantara,  \nThe Brhat with the Gayatri for its metre.  \nk On the impulse of the god Savitr, with the arms of the A\xc3\xa7vins, with the\nhands of Pusan, with the Gayatri metre, I take thee, in the manner of Angiras.  \nl Thou art the spade, thou art the woman [3], from the abode of the earth I\nbear Agni of the dust in the manner of Angiras; with the Tristubh metre I\ngrasp thee in the manner of Angiras.  \nm Thou art the bearer, thou art the woman; through thee may we be strong to\ndig Agni of the dust in his place; with the Jagati metre I grasp thee in the\nmanner of Angiras.  \nn Grasping in thy hand, Savitr,  \nBearing the spade of gold,  \nTherewith digging Agni  \nDo thou bring for us light unperishing.  \nWith the Anustubh metre I grasp thee in the manner of Angiras.\n\n### iv. i. 2.\n\na This bond of order they grasped  \nAt their assemblies in ages gone by, the sages;  \nTherewith the gods mastered the pressed (juice)--  \nIn the Saman of order proclaiming the stream.  \nb Swiftly run hither, O steed,  \nAlong the most extended space;  \nIn the sky is thy highest birth,  \nIn the atmosphere thy navel, on the earth thy birthplace.  \nc Yoke ye two the ass,  \nIn this course, O ye of mighty wealth,  \nWhich beareth Agni, serving us.  \nd In each need more strong,  \nIn each contest, we invoke,  \nAs friends, Indra to aid us.  \ne Hastening [1] come hither, trampling the enemy,  \nCome with wondrous skill from the leadership of Rudra;  \nFare along the broad atmosphere,  \nWith happy pastures, bestowing security.  \nf With Pusan as fellow, from the abode of the earth do thou approach  \nAgni of the dust in the manner of Angiras.  \ng We approach Agni of the dust in the manner of Angiras.  \nh We will bear Agni of the dust in the manner of Angiras.  \ni We bear Agni of the dust in the manner of Angiras.  \nk Agni gazed along the forefront of the dawns,  \nAlong the days first, the all-knower,  \nAnd in many ways along the rays of the sun [2],  \nHe hath extended along sky and earth.  \nI The steed coming from the way  \nDriveth every foe;  \nHe is fain to gaze with his eye  \nOn Agni in his great abode.  \nm Coming to earth, O steed,  \nDo thou seek Agni with thy radiance;  \nTurning from earth I tell us  \nWhence we shall dig him up.  \nn Thy back is the sky, thy abode earth,  \nThy breath the atmosphere, thy birthplace the ocean;  \nDiscerning with thine eye,  \nDo thou overcome [3] the enemy.  \no Arise for great prosperity  \nFrom this abode, giving wealth, O steed;  \nMay we enjoy the loving favour of earth,  \nThat are about to dig fire in her lap.  \np The strong steed hath stepped forward, giving wealth;  \nHe hath made the place of earth well wrought;  \nThence let us dig Agni of fair aspect,  \nMounting the heaven on the top of the vault.  \nq The water divine do thou pour, full of sweetness  \nTo avert diseases for men,  \nFrom their place let arise  \nPlants with fair leaves.  \nr I touch [4] Agni with mind, with ghee,  \nWho lordeth it over all the worlds,  \nBroad, vast, with pervading vital power,  \nMost extensive, impetuous, winning, food.  \ns I touch thee with speech, with ghee,  \nWith friendly mind accept it;  \nWith mortal glory, with engaging colour,  \nAgni, with body full of life may not be touched.  \nt Round the offerings hath Agni gone,  \nThe sage, the lord of strength,  \nBestowing jewels on the donor.  \nu May we set thee around us, O Agni,  \nThe sage, O strong one, as a fort,  \nOf daring due, day by day,  \nDestroyer of that which may be broken.  \nv Thou, O Agni, with days, fain to shine towards us,  \nThou from the waters, thou from the rock,  \nThou from the woods, thou from the plants,  \nThou, O lord of men, art born pure.\n\n### iv. 1. 3.\n\na On the impulse of the god Savitr, with the arms of the A\xc3\xa7vins, with the\nhands of Pusan, in the abode of earth, I dig Agni of the dust in the manner of\nAngiras.  \nb Full of light, thou, O Agni; of fair aspect,  \nShining with unaging radiance,  \nAuspicious and harmless to offspring,  \nIn the abode of earth, I dig Agni of the dust in the manner of Angiras.  \nc Thou art the back of the waters, expansive, wide,  \nAbout to bear Agni, least to be laid aside;  \nGrowing to might as the lotus-flower,  \nDo thou extend in width with the measure of heaven.  \nd Ye two are protectors [1] and a help,  \nUnbroken, both expansive;  \nDo ye expanding be united;  \nBear Agni of the dust.  \ne Be ye united, that win the heaven,  \nIn union of heart and self;  \nWho shall bear within Agni  \nFull of light and unaging.  \nf Thou art of the dust, all-supporting; Atharvan first pressed out thee, O\nAgni.  \ng Thee, O Agni, from the lotus  \nAtharvan pressed out,  \nFrom the head of every priest.  \nh Thee the sage, Dadhya\xc3\xb1c,  \nSon [2] of Atharvan, doth kindle,  \nSlayer of Vrtra, destroyer of foes.  \ni Thee Pathya Vrsan doth kindle,  \nBest slayer of foes,  \nWinner of booty in every conflict.  \nk Sit thou, O Hotr, in thine own world, wise,  \nPlace thou the sacrifice in the birthplace of good deeds,  \nEager for the gods, do thou sacrifice to them with oblation;  \nO Agni, bestow great strength on the sacrificer.  \nl The Hotr hath sat him down in the place of the Hoty, wise,  \nGlittering, shining, skilful,  \nWith vows and foresight undeceived, most wealthy,  \nBearing a thousand, pure-tongued Agni.  \nm Sit thou down, thou art great,  \nBurn [3] best servant of the gods;  \nO Agni, pure one, send forth the ruddy smoke,  \nO famous one, that can be seen afar.  \nn Be born noble in the forefront of the days,  \nKind to the kindly, red in the woods;  \nBestowing seven jewels in every home  \nHath Agni sat him down as Hotr.\n\n### iv. 1. 4.\n\na May I Vayu, Matari\xc3\xa7van, unite  \nThe broken heart of thee that art outstretched  \nTo him who moveth with the expiration of the gods,  \nWith thee, O goddess, be Vasat.  \nb Wellborn, with light,  \nGuard and protector, thou hast sat on the heaven;  \nO Agni, thy garment of many hues,  \nPut on, O thou that dost abound in light.  \nc Arise, thou of fair sacrifice,  \nAid us with thy divine radiance;  \nBrilliant to behold, with mighty blaze,  \nDo thou come hither, O Agni, in response to our prayers [1].  \nd Arise erect to aid us,  \nLike Savitr, the god;  \nErect to win the booty,  \nWhen in contest we call on thee with the shining praisers.  \ne Born, thou art the child of the two worlds,  \nO Agni; a brilliant child distributed among the plants;  \nA beauteous babe beyond the darkness outspread,  \nThou didst come thundering from thy mothers.  \nf Be firm, of strong limbs,  \nSwift, a mighty steed;  \nBe broad, of kindly seat,  \nThou art the carrier of dust for Agni.  \ng Be auspicious [2], for offspring  \nOf men, O Angiras;  \nScorch not sky and earth,  \nNor the atmosphere, nor the trees.  \nh Let the steed advance, thundering  \nAnd resounding, the ass, the flier;  \nBearing Agni of the dust  \nMay he fall not before his day.  \ni The ass, well yoked to your chariot,  \nO ye strong ones, that thundereth,  \nMay he as swift envoy  \nBear hence Agni of the dust.  \nk The strong, bearing the strong Agni,  \nGerm of the waters, him of the ocean,  \nO Agni, come hither, for enjoyment [3],  \nAs holy order and truth.  \nl O plants, do ye accept Agni here  \nWho cometh auspicious towards you;  \nCasting aside all hostilities, all evil imaginings,  \nSitting down, may he smite away from us misfortune.  \nm O plants, do ye rejoice in him,  \nO ye that are rich in flowers, and have fair berries;  \nThis germ of yours, of due season,  \nHath sat him in his ancient seat.\n\n### iv. 1. 5.\n\na Radiant with extending blaze,  \nDo thou repel the enemy, the Raksas's hostility;  \nMay I enjoy the protection of the great protector,  \nMay I enjoy the leadership of Agni, easy to invoke.  \nb Ye, waters, are healing;  \nFurther us to strength,  \nTo see great joy.  \nc The most auspicious flavour that is yours,  \nAccord to us here,  \nLike eager mothers.  \nd To him may we come with satisfaction,  \nTo whose dwelling ye quicken us,  \nO waters, and propagate us.  \ne Mitra [1], having united the earth  \nAnd the ground with light,  \nAgni well-born, all-knower,  \nCommon to all men, the wide extending.  \nf For health I unite thee, for offspring; may the All-gods, common to all men,\nunite thee with the Anustubh metre, in the manner of Angiras.  \ng The Rudras, having gathered together the earth,  \nKindled a great light;  \nTheir ray undying  \nShineth clear among the gods.  \nh United by the Vasus, the cunning Rudras,  \nThe mud fit for the rite,  \nMaking it smooth with her hands,  \nMay Sinivali fashion [2] this (pan).  \ni Sinivali, of fair braids,  \nOf fair head-dress, with fair locks,  \nMay she, O Aditi, O great one,  \nPlace within thy hands the pan.  \nk Let Aditi fashion the pan with might,  \nWith her arms , with wisdom,  \nLet her bear Agni in her womb  \nAs a mother a child in her lap.  \nI Thou art the head of Makha.  \nm Ye are the two feet of the sacrifice.  \nn May the Vasus fashion thee with the Gayatri metre, in the manner of Angiras.\nThou art the earth; may the Rudras fashion thee with the Tristubh metre, in\nthe manner of Angiras. Thou art the atmosphere [3]; may the Adityas fashion\nthee with the Jagati metre in the manner of Angiras. Thou art the sky; may the\nAll-gods, common to all men, fashion thee with the Anustubh metre, in the\nmanner of Angiras. Thou art the quarters; thou art the fixed (quarter); fix in\nme offspring, increase of wealth, richness in cattle, richness in heroes,\n(subject) his fellows to the sacrificer.  \no Thou art the girdle of Aditi.  \np Let Aditi seize thy hole with the Pankti metre, in the manner of Angiras.  \nq Having made the great pan,  \nWrought of clay, as a birthplace for Agni,  \nAditi gave it to her sons,  \n(Saying), 'Let them cook it.'\n\n### iv. 1. 6.\n\na May the Vasus fumigate thee with the Gayatri metre, in the manner of\nAngiras; may the Rudras fumigate thee with the Tristubh metre, in the manner\nof Angiras; may the Adityas fumigate thee with the Jagati metre, in the manner\nof Angiras; may the All-gods, common to all men, fumigate thee with the\nAnustubh metre, in the manner of Angiras; may Indra fumigate thee in the\nmanner of Angiras; may Visnu fumigate thee in the manner of Angiras; may\nVaruna fumigate thee in the manner of Angiras.  \nb May Aditi, connected with the All-gods, the goddess, dig thee on the abode\nof earth, in the manner of Angiras, O trench.  \nc May the wives of the gods [1], the goddesses, connected with the All-gods,\nplace thee on the abode of earth, in the manner of Angiras, O pan.  \nd May the Dhisanas, the goddesses connected with the All-gods, kindle thee on\nthe abode of earth, in the manner of Angiras, O pan; may the wives, the\ngoddesses, connected with the All-gods, prepare thee on the abode of earth, in\nthe manner of Angiras, O pan; may the protectors, the women, the goddesses,\nconnected with the All-gods, cook thee on the abode of earth, in the manner of\nAngiras, O pan.  \ne O Mitra, cook this pan; may it not break.  \nf This I place around thee, to prevent breaking.  \ng Mitra, extending, compasseth  \nThis sky in greatness [2],  \nAnd the earth with his fame.  \nh The fame of Mitra, supporter of the people,  \nOf the god is eternal,  \nTrue, and most varied in fame.  \ni May the god Savitr dig thee out,  \nWith fair hands, fair fingers,  \nFair arms, with his might.  \nk Breaking not, O earth,  \nDo thou fill the regions, the quarters;  \nArise, become great,  \nStand upright, be thou firm.  \nl May the Vasus fill thee with the Gayatri metre, in the manner of Angiras:\nmay the Rudras fill thee with the Tristubh metre, in the manner of Angiras;\nmay the Adityas fill thee with the Jagati metre, in the manner of Angiras; may\nthe All-gods, common to all men, fill thee with the Anustubh metre, in the\nmanner of Angiras.\n\n### iv. 1. 7.\n\na Let the half-years, the seasons, increase thee, O Agni,  \nThe years, the Rsis, and what truths there are;  \nShine with thy heavenly lustre,  \nIlluminate all the quarters of the earth.  \nb Be kindled, O Agni, and awake him;  \nArise for great good fortune;  \nMay he that waiteth on thee, O Agni, be not harmed;  \nMay thy priests be famous, not the others.  \nc These Brahmans, O Agni, choose thee;  \nBe thou propitious, O Agni [1], to us in the sanctuary;  \nSlaying our rivals, conquering the foes,  \nDo thou watch unfailing in thine own home.  \nd Here, O Agni, do thou grant wealth;  \nMay not the overcomers, anticipating (us); overcome thee;  \nMay the lordly power be easily wielded by thee, O Agni  \nLet him who waiteth on thee prosper, unassailed.  \ne With good life, O Agni, unite thee with the lordly power;  \nO Agni, vie with Mitra in friendlihood;  \nBe thou the midmost of thine equals;  \nO Agni, shine forth here to be invoked by kings.  \nf (Be thou) over the [2] enemy, the obstructor,  \nUnwisdom, niggardliness, O Agni,  \nAll obstacles do thou overcome,  \nAnd bestow upon us wealth with heroes.  \ng Unassailable, all-knower, unoverpowered,  \nRuling, O Agni, supporting the lordly power, do thou shine here;  \nThrough all the regions, freeing men from fear,  \nDo thou this day guard us for increase with kindliness.  \nh O Brhaspati, instigator, awake him;  \nThe sharp do thou more thoroughly sharpen;  \nIncrease him to great prosperity [3]  \nLet the All-gods rejoice in him.  \ni What time, O Brhaspati, thou didst free  \nFrom life yonder, from Yama's enmity,  \nThe A\xc3\xa7vins removed death from him,  \nO Agni, the physicians of the gods with their powers.  \nk We from the darkness,  \nGazing on the higher light,  \nSurya a god among the gods,  \nHave come to the highest light.\n\n### iv. 1. 8.\n\na Uplifted are his kindling-sticks,  \nUplifted and pure are the rays of Agni,  \nMost brilliant (are they) of the son of fair countenance.  \nb The son of self, the Asura, all-knower,  \nGod, god among gods,  \nAnointeth the ways with mead and ghee.  \nc With mead thou attainest the sacrifice,  \nDelighting, as Nara\xc3\xa7ansa, O Agni,  \nThe kindly god Savitr, with every boon.  \nd Hither he cometh, with might, with ghee,  \nThe priest implored with adoration;  \nTo Agni the ladles (move) when the rites proceed.  \ne Worship let him pay to the greatness of him, of Agni;  \nHe [1] indeed is pre-eminent among the delightful,  \nThe wealthy, the wisest, best bestower of wealth.  \nf The divine doors--all--preserve  \nThe rules of him, of Agni,  \nOf wide expanse, lording it with dominion.  \ng May day and night  \nLike heavenly maidens in his birthplace  \nProtect this our sacrifice and offering.  \nh O ye divine Hotrs, sing ye  \nTo our uplifted sacrifice, to Agni's tongue,  \nMake for us good offering.  \ni May the three goddesses sit on this strew,  \nIda, Sarasvati [2], Bharati, the great, being sung.  \nk That seminal fluid of ours, wondrous,  \nAbundant, may Tvastr release  \nAs increase of wealth with good heroes, as offspring to us.  \nl O tree, let free,  \nBestowing with thyself among the gods;  \nLet Agni as queller make ready the oblation.  \nm O Agni, utter 'Hail!' O all-knower, over the oblation for Indra;  \nMay all the gods rejoice in this offering.  \nn The golden germ first arose;  \nBorn he was the only lord of creation;  \nHe supporteth the earth and the sky [3]  \nTo what god shall we offer with oblation?  \no He that alone by his might is king  \nOf the breathing, the winking world,  \nWho is lord of these bipeds and quadrupeds;  \nTo what god shall we offer with oblation?  \np He who is giver of breath, giver of strength,  \nUpon whose bidding all, even the gods, wait,  \nWhose shadow is immortality and death;  \nTo what god shall we offer with oblation?  \nHe whose are these snowy mountains through his might,  \nWhose they call the ocean with the Rasa [4],  \nWhose two arms are these quarters;  \nTo what god shall we offer with oblation?  \nr To whom the armies stablished  \nThrough his aid gazed with minds disturbed,  \nOver whom on the rising of the sun it goeth;  \nTo what god shall we offer with oblation?  \ns He by whom the dread earth and the sky were made firm,  \nBy whom the heaven was established, by whom the vault,  \nWho is the measure of the region in the atmosphere;  \nTo what god shall we offer with oblation?  \nt When the waters, the great ones, went  \nBearing all [5] strength, begetting Agni,  \nThen one breath of the gods arose;  \nTo what god shall we offer with oblation?  \nu He who in his might beheld the waters  \nBearing strength, begetting Agni,  \nWho was the god alone over the gods;  \nTo what god shall we offer with oblation?\n\n### iv. 1. 9.\n\na Purpose, Agni, impulse, hail!

 \nAccept it, O youngest one.  \nc Mighty by night, unfailingly bearing (food)  \nFor him as fodder to a stalled horse,  \nMay we, O Agni, thy neighbours, be not harmed,  \nRejoicing in increase of wealth, in food.  \nd Kindled on earth's navel [1], Agni  \nWe invoke for great increase of wealth,  \nDelighting in drink, recipient of great praise, worthy of offering,  \nThe victor, Agni, sustainer in battles.  \ne The hosts that attack,  \nThat pierce, the trooping,  \nThe thieves and the robbers,  \nThem, O Agni, do I place in thy mouth.  \nf With thy tusks the burglars,  \nWith thy teeth the robbers,  \nWith thy jaws the thieves, O blessed one,  \nDo thou chew, well chewed.  \ng The burglars among men,  \nThe thieves and robbers in the forest,  \nThe [2] mischief-workers in the thickets,  \nThem I place within thy jaws.  \nh The man who is hostile to us,  \nAnd him who hateth us,  \nHim who revileth us, and him who seeketh to hurt,  \nEvery one of them do thou crush to atoms.  \ni Sharpened is my holy power,  \nSharpened the strength and might,  \nSharpened the conquering lordly power of him  \nWhose domestic priest I am.  \nk Their arms have I uplifted,  \nTheir radiance, their might;  \nWith holy power I waste the foes,  \nI support [3] my own.  \nI Shining like gold, he hath become widely resplendent,  \nFor glory shining with immortal life;  \nAgni became immortal in his strength  \nWhat time prolific Dyaus begat him.  \nm The sage showeth all forms;
