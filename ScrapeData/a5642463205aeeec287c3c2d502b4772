Some are inherent in the subject,\nsuch as the changes which have taken place in the topography of India since\nthe lists were compiled, and the imperfectness of the specification itself:\nstates and tribes and cities have disappeared, even from recollection, and\nsome of the natural features of the country, especially the rivers, have\nundergone a total alteration. Buchanan (Description of Eastern Hindustan),\nfollowing Rennell over the same ground at an interval of some thirty or forty\nyears, remarks that many of the streams laid down in the Bengal Atlas (the\nonly series of maps of India yet published, that can be regarded as of\nauthority) are no longer to be traced. Then the lists which are given are such\nmere catalogues, that they afford no clue to verification beyond names; and\nnames have been either changed or so corrupted, as to be no longer\nrecognizable. On the other hand, much of the difficulty arises from our own\nwant of knowledge. Scattered through the Puran\xcc\x81as and other works, the names\ngiven in the topographical lists recur with circumstances which fix their\nlocality; but these means of verification have not yet been sufficiently\ninvestigated. There are also geographical treatises in Sanscrit, which there\nis reason to believe afford much accurate and interesting information: they\nare not common. Col. Wilford speaks of having received a number from Jaypur,\nbut upon his death they disappeared. After a considerable interval some of his\nMSS. were purchased for the Calcutta Sanscrit College, but by far the larger\nportion of his collection had been dispersed. A few leaves only on\ngeographical subjects were found, from which I translated and published a\nchapter on the geography of some of the districts of Bengal: (Calcutta\nQuarterly Magazine, Dec. 1824:) the details were accurate and valuable, though\nthe compilation was modern. Notwithstanding these impediments, however, we\nshould be able to identify at least mountains and rivers to a much greater\nextent than is now practicable, if our maps were not so miserably defective in\ntheir nomenclature. None of our surveyors or geographers have been Oriental\nscholars. It may be doubted if any of them have been conversant with the\nspoken language of the country: they have consequently put down names at p.\n180 random, according to their own inaccurate appreciation of sounds\ncarelessly, vulgarly, and corruptly uttered; and their maps of India are\ncrowded with appellations which bear no similitude whatever either to past or\npresent denominations. We need not wonder that we cannot discover Sanscrit\nnames in English maps, when, in the immediate vicinity of Calcutta, Barnagore\nrepresents Varahanagar, Dakshineswar is metamorphosed into Duckinsore,and\nUlubaria is Anglicised into Willoughbruy. Going a little farther off, we have\nDalkisore for Darikeswari, Midnapore for Medinipur, and a most unnecessary\naccumulation of consonants in Caughmahry for Kakamari. There is scarcely a\nname in our Indian maps that does not afford proof of extreme indifference to\naccuracy in nomenclature, and of an incorrectness in estimating sounds, which\nis in some degree, perhaps, a national defect.\n\n[180:2](vp061.htm#fr_398) The printed edition reads \xc5\x9aaktimat, which is also\nfound in some MSS., but the more usual reading is that of the text. I may here\nadd that a \xc5\x9auktimat mountain occurs in Bhima\'s invasion of the eastern region.\nMahabh. Sabha P. Gandhamadana here takes the place of Riksha.\n\n[180:3](vp061.htm#fr_399) For additional mountains in the Vayu, see Asiatic\nResearches, VIII. 334 The Bhagavata, Padma, and Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya add the\nfollowing: Mainaka, which it appears from the Ramayan\xcc\x81a is at the source of\nthe Sone, that river being termed Mainakaprabhava. \'Kishkindhya Kan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a;\'\nTrikut\xcc\x81a, called also in Hemachanchra\'s vocabulary Suvela; Rishabha, Kut\xcc\x81aka,\nKonwa, Devagiri (Deogur or Ellora, the mountain of the gods; the Apocopi are\nsaid by Ptolemy to be also called mountains of the gods); Rishyamuka, in the\nDekhin, where the Pampa rises; \xc5\x9ari-\xc5\x9baila or \xc5\x9ari-parvata, near the Krishn\xcc\x81a\n(As. Res. V. 303); Venkata, the hill of Tripati, Varidhara, Mangala-prastha,\nDron\xcc\x81a, Chitrakut\xcc\x81a (Chitrakote in Bundelkhand), Govarddhana (near Mathura),\nRaivata, the range that branches off from the western portion of the Vindhya\ntowards the north, extending nearly to the Jumna; according to Hemachandra it\nis the Girin\xcc\x81ara range; it is the Aravali of Tod; Kakubha, Nila (the blue\nmountains of Orissa), Gohamukha, Indrakila, Ramagiri (Ram-tek, near Nag-pur),\nValakrama, Sudhama, Tungaprastha, Naga (the hills east of Ramghur), Bodhana,\nPandara, Durjayanta, Arbuda (Abu in Guzerat), Gomanta (in the western Ghats),\nKut\xcc\x81a\xc5\x9baila, Kritasmara, and Chakora. Many single mountains are named in\ndifferent works.\n\n[180:4](vp061.htm#fr_400) See note 4, p. 175.\n\n[180:5](vp061.htm#fr_401) The Sarsuti, or Caggar or Gaggar, N. W. of Tahnesar.\nSee below, note 6.\n\n[181:6](vp061.htm#fr_402) The Bahuda is elsewhere said to rise in the\nHimalaya. Wilford considers it to be the Mahanada, which falls into the Ganges\nbelow Malda. The Mahabharata has amongst the Tirthas, or places of pilgrimage,\ntwo rivers of this name, one apparently near the Saraswati, one more to the\neast. Hemachandra gives as synonymes \xc3\x81rjuni and Saitavahini, both implying the\n\'white river:\' a main feeder of the Mahanada is called Dhavali or Daub, which\nhas the same meaning.\n\n[181:7](vp061.htm#fr_403) The Drishadwati is a river of considerable\nimportance in the history of the Hindus, although no traces of its ancient\nname exist. According to Manu it is one boundary of the district called\nBrahmavartta, in which the institution of castes, and their several duties,\nhad for ever existed: implying that in other places they were of more recent\norigin. This holy land, \'made by the gods,\' was of very limited extent. Its\nother boundary was the Saraswati. That the Drishadwati was not far off we\nlearn from Manu, as Kurukshetra, Matsya, Panchala, and \xc5\x9aurasena, or the upper\npart of the Doab, and country to the east, were not included in Brahmavartta;\nthey constituted Brahmarshi-de\xc5\x9ba, contiguous to it: Kulluka Bhat\xcc\x81t\xcc\x81a explains\nAnantara, \'something less or inferior;\' but it more probably means \'not\ndivided from,\' \'immediately contiguous.\' We must look for the Drishadwati,\ntherefore, west of the Jumna. In the Tirtha Yatra of the Mahabharata we find\nit forming one of the boundaries of Kurukshetra. It is there said, \'Those who\ndwell on the south of the Saraswati, and north of the Drishadwati, or in\nKurukshetra, dwell in heaven.\' In the same place, the confluence of the\nDrishadwati with a stream of Kurukshetra, called the Kau\xc5\x9biki, is said to be of\npeculiar sanctity. Kurukshetra is the country about Tahnesur or Sthane\xc5\x9bwara,\nwhere a spot called Kurukhet still exists, and is visited in pilgrimage. The\nKirin-kshetra of Manu may be intended for the country of the Kurus, in the\nmore immediate vicinity of Delhi. According to Wilford, the Drishadwati is the\nCaggar; in which case our maps have taken the liberty of transposing the names\nof the rivers, as the Caggar now is the northern stream, and the Sursooty the\nsouthern, both rising in the Himalaya, and uniting to form one river, called\nGagar or Caggar in the maps, but more correctly Sarsuti or Saraswati; which\nthen runs south-west, and is lost in the desert. There have no doubt been\nconsiderable changes here, both in the nomenclature and in the courses of the\nrivers.\n\n[181:8](vp061.htm#fr_404) The Beyah, Hyphasis, or Bibasis.\n\n[181:9](vp061.htm#fr_405) The Ravi or Hydraotes or Adris.\n\n[181:10](vp061.htm#fr_406) The Jhelum, but still called in Kashmir the\nVitasta, the Bidaspes or Hydaspes.\n\n[181:11](vp061.htm#fr_407) This river, according to the Vishn\xcc\x81u P., rises from\nthe Riksha mountains, but the Vayu and Kurma bring it from the Vindhya or\nSathpura range. There are several indications of its position in the\nMahabharata, but none very precise. Its p. 182 source appears to be near that\nof the Krishn\xcc\x81a: it flows near the beginning of the Dan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81aka forest, which\nshould place it rather near to the sources of the Godavari: it passes through\nVidarbha or Berar, and, Yudhisht\xcc\x81hira having bathed in it, comes to the\nVaidurya mountain and the Narmada river. These circumstances make it likely\nthat the Payin Ganga is the river in question.\n\n[182:12](vp061.htm#fr_408) The Deva, or Goggra.\n\n[182:13](vp061.htm#fr_409) Both these are from the Paripatra range. In some\nMSS. the latter is read Vedasini and Vetasini. In the Ramayan\xcc\x81a occur Veda and\nVedavainasika, which may be the same, as they seem to be in the direction of\nthe Sone. One of them may be the Beos of eastern Malwa, but it rises in the\nRiksha mountain.\n\n[182:14](vp061.htm#fr_410) From Paripatra, Kurma; from Mahendra, Vayu.\n\n[182:15](vp061.htm#fr_411) One copy has Ikshumalini; two others, Ikshula and\nKrimi: one MS. of the Vayu has an Ikshula from Mahendra: the Matsya has\nIkshuda; Wilford\'s list has Drakshala.\n\n[182:16](vp061.htm#fr_412) Of these rivers, the two first are named in the\nPadma P., but not in the Vayu, &c. The Gomati in Oude, the Gandak, and the\nKosi are well known. The Dhutapapa is said to rise in the Himalaya.\n\n[182:17](vp061.htm#fr_413) In different MSS. read Michita and Nisrita. In the\nVayu and Matsya, Ni\xc5\x9bchira or Nirvira is said to flow from the Himalaya.\n\n[182:18](vp061.htm#fr_414) Also Lohataran\xcc\x81i and Lohacharin\xcc\x81i.\n\n[182:19](vp061.htm#fr_415) The Sarayu or Sarju is commonly identified with the\nDeva. Wilford says it is so by the Pauran\xcc\x81ics, but we have here proof to the\ncontrary. They are also distinguished by the people of the country. Although\nidentical through great part of their course, they rise as different streams,\nand again divide and enter the Ganges by distinct branches.\n\n[182:20](vp061.htm#fr_416) The recurrence of the same name in this, as in\nseveral similar subsequent instances, is possibly an error of the copyist; but\nit is also sometimes likely that one name is applied to different rivers. In\none MS. we have, in place of this word, Chaitravati; and in another Vetravati.\n\n[182:21](vp061.htm#fr_417) Read also \xc5\x9aatavari. According to Wilford, the\n\xc5\x9aaravati is the Ban-ganga.\n\n[182:22](vp061.htm#fr_418) The Vayu has Para, which is a river in Malwa, the\nParvati. MSS. read Van\xcc\x81i and Ven\xcc\x81a.\n\n[182:23](vp061.htm#fr_419) According to the Vayu, this rises in the Sahya m.,\nand flows towards the south: it is therefore the Beema of Aurungabad.\n\n[182:24](vp061.htm#fr_420) The Kaveri is well known, and has always borne the\nsame appellation, being the Chaberis of Ptolemy.\n\n[182:25](vp061.htm#fr_421) Read Chuluka.\n\n[182:26](vp061.htm#fr_422) Read also Tapi; the Tapti river of the Dekhin.\n\n[182:27](vp061.htm#fr_423) Read Ahita and Sahita.\n\n[183:28](vp061.htm#fr_424) Rises in the Sahya mountain, and flows southwards:\nVayu, &c.\n\n[183:29](vp061.htm#fr_425) Read Vichitra.\n\n[183:30](vp061.htm#fr_426) Several rivers are called by this name, as well as\nthe Indus: there is one of some note, the Kali Sindh in Malwa.\n\n[183:31](vp061.htm#fr_427) Also Vajini.\n\n[183:32](vp061.htm#fr_428) This agrees best in name with the Beema: it is also\nmentioned as a tirtha in the Mahabharata.\n\n[183:33](vp061.htm#fr_429) From \xc5\x9auktimat: Kurma and Vayu. There is a Balasan\nfrom the eastern portion of the Himalaya, a feeder of the Mahanada, which may\nbe the Palasini, if the mountain be in this direction.\n\n[183:34](vp061.htm#fr_430) Also Pippalalavati. The Vayu has a Pippala from the\nRiksha mountain.\n\n[183:35](vp061.htm#fr_431) Also Ku\xc5\x9bavira.\n\n[183:36](vp061.htm#fr_432) Also Mahika and Marun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81achi.\n\n[183:37](vp061.htm#fr_433) Also \xc5\x9aena.\n\n[183:38](vp061.htm#fr_434) Read Kritavati and Ghritavati.\n\n[183:39](vp061.htm#fr_435) Also Dhu\xc5\x9bulya.\n\n[183:40](vp061.htm#fr_436) Also Atikrishn\xcc\x81a.\n\n[183:41](vp061.htm#fr_437) In place of both Suvarthachi.\n\n[183:42](vp061.htm#fr_438) From Paripatra: Vayu and Matsya.\n\n[183:43](vp061.htm#fr_439) Also Ku\xc5\x9banara.\n\n[183:44](vp061.htm#fr_440) Also \xc5\x9aa\xc5\x9bikanta.\n\n[183:45](vp061.htm#fr_441) Also Vastra and Suvastra.\n\n[183:46](vp061.htm#fr_442) One of the tirthas in the Mahabharata.\n\n[183:47](vp061.htm#fr_443) According to the Mahabharata, this rises in the\nVaidurya mountain, part of the southern Vindhya or Sathpura range.\n\n[183:48](vp061.htm#fr_444) Also Kuvira.\n\n[183:49](vp061.htm#fr_445) Three MSS. agree in reading this Ambuvahini.\n\n[183:50](vp061.htm#fr_446) Also Vainadi.\n\n[183:51](vp061.htm#fr_447) Also Kuven\xcc\x81a: it is possibly meant for the\nTungabhadra or Toombudra.\n\n[183:52](vp061.htm#fr_448) A river in Malwa, so called from the city of the\nsame name, which I have elsewhere conjectured to be Bhilsa. Megha Duta, 31.\nThere is a \'Bess\' river in the maps, which joins the Betwa at Bhilsa, and is\nprobably the river of the text.\n\n[183:53](vp061.htm#fr_449) The Varna or Suvama, \'the beautiful river,\' Wilford\nidentifies with the Ramganga.\n\n[183:54](vp061.htm#fr_450) Also Mahapaga, \'the great river.\'\n\n[183:55](vp061.htm#fr_451) Also Kuchchila.\n\n[183:56](vp061.htm#fr_452) The Sona river, rising in Mainaka or Amarakantak,\nand flowing east to the Ganges.\n\n[184:57](vp061.htm#fr_453) This and the preceding both rise from the Vindhya\nmountain: the latter is also read Antassila, \'the river flowing within or\namidst rocks.\'\n\n[184:58](vp061.htm#fr_454) Also Paroksha.\n\n[184:59](vp061.htm#fr_455) We have a Surana in the Vayu, and Surasa in the\nKurma and Matsya, flowing from the Riksha mountain.\n\n[184:60](vp061.htm#fr_456) The Tamasa or Tonse, from Riksha.\n\n[184:61](vp061.htm#fr_457) This and the preceding scarcely merit a place\namongst the rivers, being two small streams which fall into the Ganges east\nand west of Benares, which is thence denominated Varanasi.\n\n[184:62](vp061.htm#fr_458) Parn\xcc\x81a\xc5\x9ba or Varn\xcc\x81a\xc5\x9ba, from the Paripatra mountain.\n\n[184:63](vp061.htm#fr_459) Also Manavi.\n\n[184:64](vp061.htm#fr_460) The Krishn\xcc\x81a of the Dakhin is probably here\nintended, although its more ordinary designation seems to be that already\nspecified, Krishn\xcc\x81aven\xcc\x81a or Krishn\xcc\x81aven\xcc\x81i. The meaning is much the same; the\none being the \'dark river,\' the other simply the \'dark,\' the Niger.\n\n[184:65](vp061.htm#fr_461) A river from \xc5\x9auktimat: Vayu.\n\n[184:66](vp061.htm#fr_462) A river in Cuttack, according to Wilford: it is one\nof the tirthas of the Mahabharata, and apparently in a different direction.\nBuchanan (Eastern Hindustan) has a river of this name in Dinajpur.\n\n[184:67](vp061.htm#fr_463) Both from the Vindhya: Vayu and Kurma. There is a\nGoaris in Ptolemy in central India.\n\n[184:68](vp061.htm#fr_464) From Riksha: Vayu.\n\n[184:69](vp061.htm#fr_465) Also Munja and Makaravahini.\n\n[184:70](vp061.htm#fr_466) From Riksha: Vayu.

It is named in the\nMahabharata as a river of Kalinga.\n\n[184:72](vp061.htm#fr_468) Also read Nipa and Koka.\n\n[184:73](vp061.htm#fr_469) From Riksha, but read also \xc5\x9auktimati, which is the\nreading of the Matsya. Wilford considers it to be the Swarnarekka of Cuttack.\n\n[184:74](vp061.htm#fr_470) Also Anaga and Suranga; perhaps the preferable\nreading should be Sumanga, a river .flowing from Mainaka, according to the\nMahabharata.\n\n[184:75](vp061.htm#fr_471) Part of the Brahmaputra.\n\n[184:76](vp061.htm#fr_472) A considerable river in the east, flowing between\nDinajpur and Rangpur.\n\n[184:77](vp061.htm#fr_473) Also Vrishasahwa.\n\n[184:78](vp061.htm#fr_474) This and the preceding flow from \xc5\x9auktimat,\naccording to the [Vayu](errata.htm#6), Matsya, and Kurma. The last occurs also\nRishika.\n\n[184:79](vp061.htm#fr_475) Also Suparn\xcc\x81a. The Punya is\n[considered](errata.htm#7) to be the Pun-pun of Behan, but there is also a\nParna river in the same province.\n\n[185:80](vp061.htm#fr_476) It is possible that further research will identify\nmore than those attempted to be verified in the foregoing notes, as well as\nmeet with others readily recognizable. In the authorities consulted several\noccur not comprehended in the text, as the Kuhu and Ikshu, from the Himalaya;\nVritraghni, Chandana (Chandan of Bhagalpur), Mahi (the Mahy of western Malwa),\n\xc5\x9aipra, and Avanti (rivers near Ujayin), from Paripatra; Mahanada in Orissa,\nDruma, Dasarn\xcc\x81a (Dhosaun in Bundelkhand), Chitrakut\xcc\x81a, \xc5\x9aroni or \xc5\x9ayena,\nPi\xc5\x9bachika, Banjula, Baluvahini, and Matkun\xcc\x81a, all from Riksha; Nirvindhya,\nMadra, Nishadha, \xc5\x9ainibahu, Kumudvati, and Toya, from Vindhya; Banjula, from\nSahya; Kritamala, Tamraparn\xcc\x81i, Pushpajati, and Utpalavati, from Malaya;\nLangulini and Vansadhara, from Mahendra; and Mandaga and Kripa or Rupa, from\n\xc5\x9auktimat. In the Ramayan\xcc\x81a we have, besides some already specified, the\nRuchira, Pampa, eastern Saraswati, Vegavati or Vyki of Madura, and Varada or\nWurda of Berar; and we have many others in the Mahabharata and different\nworks, from which the Sanscrit appellations of most of the Indian rivers might\nbe, with some little time and trouble, collected.\n\n[185:1](vp061.htm#fr_477) The people of the upper part of the Doab. The two\nwords might also be understood as denoting the Panchalas of the Kuru country,\nthere being two divisions of the tribe: see below, note 20.\n\n[185:2](vp061.htm#fr_478) The \xc5\x9aurasenas were the inhabitants of Mathura, the\nSuraseni of Arrian.\n\n[185:3](vp061.htm#fr_479) The people of the upper part of the Coromandel\ncoast, well known in the traditions of the eastern Archipelago as Kling.\nPtolemy has a city in that part called Caliga; and Pliny, Calingae proximi\nmari.\n\n[185:4](vp061.htm#fr_480) One of the tribes of central India, according to the\nVayu: it is also read Bahyas.\n\n[185:5](vp061.htm#fr_481) The Malas and Malavarttis are placed, in the Vayu\nand Matsya, amongst the central nations. The Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya reads Gavavarttis.\nWilford considers Mala to be the Mal-bhum of Medinipur. As noticed in the\nMegha Duta, I have supposed it to be situated in Chattisgarh. p. 21, note.\n\n[185:6](vp061.htm#fr_482) The people of Dinajpur, Rangpur, and Cooch Behar.\nCalcutta Mag. Dec. 1824.\n\n[185:7](vp061.htm#fr_483) Read Ku\xc5\x9ban\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81as, Ku\xc5\x9balyas, Ku\xc5\x9badhyas, Kisadhajas,\nand placed in central India.\n\n[185:8](vp061.htm#fr_484) Also Sau\xc5\x9balyas and Sau\xc5\x9bulyas.\n\n[185:9](vp061.htm#fr_485) Kuntala is in one place one of the central\ncountries; in another, one of the southern: the name is applied in\ninscriptions p. 186 to the province in which Curgode is situated, part of the\nAdoni district: (As. Res. IX. 427:) and consistently with this position it is\nplaced amongst the dependant or allied states of Vidarbha in the Dada Kumara.\nCalcutta Quarterly Mag. Sept. 1827.\n\n[186:10](vp061.htm#fr_486) A central nation: Vayu. The Ramayana places them in\nthe east. The combination indicates the country between Benares and Oude.\n\n[186:11](vp061.htm#fr_487) Chedi is usually considered as Chandail, on the\nwest of the Jungle Mehals, towards Nagpur. It is known, in times subsequent to\nthe Puran\xcc\x81as, as Ran\xcc\x81astambha.\n\n[186:12](vp061.htm#fr_488) Some copies read Vatsa, and the other Puran\xcc\x81as have\nsuch a name amongst the central countries; the people perhaps of Vatsa, Raja\nof Kausambhi, near the junction of the Jumna and the Ganges. There are,\nhowever, two Matsyas, one of which, according to the Yantra Samrat\xcc\x81, is\nidentifiable with Jaypur. In the Dig-vijaya of Nakula he subdues the Matsyas\nfarther to the west, or in Guzerat.\n\n[186:13](vp061.htm#fr_489) Situated on the back of the Vindhya range: Vayu and\nMatsya. They are generally named with the people of Malava, which confirms\nthis locality. They are said to be the posterity of Karusha, one of the sons\nof Vaivaswata Manu.\n\n[186:14](vp061.htm#fr_490) These are also placed along the Vindhya chain, but\nat different times appear to have occupied different positions. They were a\nkindred tribe with the Andhakas and Vrishn\xcc\x81is, and a branch of the Yadavas. A\nBhoja Raja is amongst the warriors of the Mahabharata. At a later period,\nBhoja, the Raja of Dhar, preserves an indication of this people; and from him\nthe Bhojpuris, a tribe still living in western Behar, profess to be descended:\nthey are not improbably relics of the older tribe. Bhoja is also used\nsometimes as a synonyme of Bhojakat\xcc\x81a, a city near the Narmada, founded by\nRukmi, brother-in-law of Krishn\xcc\x81a, and before that, prince of Kundin\xcc\x81a or\nCondavir.\n\n[186:15](vp061.htm#fr_491) Pulinda is applied to any wild or barbarous tribe;\nthose here named are some of the people of the deserts along the Indus; but\nPulindas are met with in many other positions, especially in the mountains and\nforests across central India, the haunts of the Bhils and Gonds. So Ptolemy\nplaces the Pulindai along the banks of the Narmada to the frontiers of Larice;\nthe Lat\xcc\x81a or Lar of the Hindus; Kandesh and part. of Guzerat.\n\n[186:16](vp061.htm#fr_492) In the other three Puran\xcc\x81as we have Uttamarn\xcc\x81as, on\nthe Vindhya range.\n\n[186:17](vp061.htm#fr_493) The people of the \'ten forts,\' subsequently\nmultiplied to \'thirty-six,\' such being the import of Chattisgerh, which seems\nto be in the site of Dasarn\xcc\x81a. Megha Duta, p. 30, note.\n\n[186:18](vp061.htm#fr_494) A Vindhya tribe, according to the other Puran\xcc\x81as.\nThe locality is confirmed by mythological personations; for Mekala is said to\nbe a Rishi, the father of the river Narmada; thence called Mekala and\nMekalakanya: the mountain where it rises is also called Mekaladri. The\nRamayan\xcc\x81a places the Mekalas amongst the southern tribes.\n\n[186:19](vp061.htm#fr_495) Utkala is still the native name of Orissa.\n\n[186:20](vp061.htm#fr_496) These may be the southern Pan\xcc\x81chalas. p. 187 When\nDron\xcc\x81a overcame Drupada, king of Panchala, as related in the Mahabharata, \xc3\x81di\nParva, he retained half the country, that north of the Ganges, and restored to\nits former chief the other half, south of that river as far as to the Chambal.\nThe capital of the latter became Makandi on the Ganges; and the country\nincluded also Kampilya, the Kampil of the Mohammedans, but placed by them in\nthe Doab. The capital of the northern portion was Ahikshetra, a name traceable\nin the Adisathrus of Ptolemy, though the position differs: but Ahikshetra or\nAhichchatra, as it is also written, seems to have been applied to more than\none city.\n\n[187:21](vp061.htm#fr_497) Perhaps the people of Tirhut, along the Kosi.\n\n[187:22](vp061.htm#fr_498) \'Having more than one back;\' probable some nickname\nor term of derision. Thus we have, in the Ramayan\xcc\x81a and other works,\nenumerated amongst tribes, the Karn\xcc\x81a-pravaran\xcc\x81as, \'those who wrap themselves\nup in their ears;\' Asht\xcc\x81a-karn\xcc\x81akas, \'the eight-eared;\' or Osht\xcc\x81ha-karn\xcc\x81akas,\n\'having lips extending to their ears;\' Kakamukhas, \'crow-faced;\' Ekapadukas,\n\'one-footed,\' or rather \'one-slippered:\' exaggerations of national ugliness,\nor allusions to peculiar customs, which were not literally intended, although\nthey may have furnished the Mandevilles of ancient and modern times with some\nof their monsters. The spirit of the nomenclature is shewn by these tribes\nbeing associated with Kiratas, \'barbarians,\' and Yavanas, either Greeks or\nMohammedans.\n\n[187:23](vp061.htm#fr_499) A preferable reading seems to be Yugandhara: a city\nin the Punjab so called is mentioned in the Mahabharata, Karn\xcc\x81a P.\n\n[187:24](vp061.htm#fr_500) Read Bodhas, Godhas, and Saudhas. There is a Rajput\ntribe called Sodha.\n\n[187:25](vp061.htm#fr_501) This may consist of two names, and is so read in\nMSS., or the latter term occurs Kalingas; both terms are repeated. Besides the\nMachu of the north, a similar word,. Madru, is applied to Madura in the south.\nAs. Res. IX. 428. The Ramayan\xcc\x81a has Madras in the east, as well as in the\nnorth.\n\n[187:26](vp061.htm#fr_502) The people of the Benares district, and that\nopposite.\n\n[187:27](vp061.htm#fr_503) The inhabitants of Ujayin.\n\n[187:28](vp061.htm#fr_504) These should be opposite to the Kuntis, but where\neither is situated does not appear.\n\n[187:29](vp061.htm#fr_505) The best reading is Gomanta, part of the Konkan\nabout Goa.\n\n[187:30](vp061.htm#fr_506) The more usual reading is Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81as; one MS. has\nParn\xcc\x81as.\n\n[187:31](vp061.htm#fr_507) A country of considerable extent and power at\nvarious periods. The name remains in Beder, which may have been the ancient\ncapital; but the kingdom seems to have corresponded with the great part of\nBerar and Kandesh. It is mentioned in the Ramayan\xcc\x81a and the Puran\xcc\x81as amongst\nthe countries of the south.\n\n[187:32](vp061.htm#fr_508) Also Rupavasikas. There is a Rupa river from the\n\xc5\x9auktimat mountain, the vicinity of which may be alluded to. We have Rupasas or\nRupapas amongst the southern tribes of the Puran\xcc\x81as.\n\n[188:33](vp061.htm#fr_509) Read also A\xc5\x9bmalas and A\xc5\x9bmakas: the latter are\nenumerated amongst the people of the south in the Ramayan\xcc\x81a, and in the Vayu,\nMatsya, and Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya P. There is a prince of the same name of the solar\ndynasty.\n\n[188:34](vp061.htm#fr_510) Gova or Kuva is an ancient name of the southern\nKonkan, and may be intended in this place by the Gopa country; or it may imply\n\'the district of cow-herds,\' that is, of Nomadic tribes.\n\n[188:35](vp061.htm#fr_511) Also read Kulatis and Pan\xcc\x81itakas.\n\n[188:36](vp061.htm#fr_512) Read also Adhirajya and Adhirasht\xcc\x81ra, which mean\nthe same, \'the over or superior kingdom.\'\n\n[188:37](vp061.htm#fr_513) Also Ku\xc5\x9badhya, Ku\xc5\x9banda, and Mukuntha.\n\n[188:38](vp061.htm#fr_514) Also Vallirasht\xcc\x81ra. There are Mallas in the east,\nalong the foot of the Himalaya, in Bhima\'s Dig-vijaya; but we should rather\nlook for them in the north-west, in the site of the Malli of Arrian. We have\nin the Puran\xcc\x81as, Maharasht\xcc\x81ra, the Mahratta country, which may be here\nintended.\n\n[188:39](vp061.htm#fr_515) Two copies read Kevala; one, Kambala, The text is\nprobably wrong, as we have Kerala below.\n\n[188:40](vp061.htm#fr_516) Also Varayasis and Varavasis: one copy has, what is\nlikely to be most correct, Vanarasyas, the monkey-faced people.\'\n\n[188:41](vp061.htm#fr_517) Read Upavaha and Pravaha.\n\n[188:42](vp061.htm#fr_518) The MSS. agree in reading this Vakra.\n\n[188:43](vp061.htm#fr_519) The \xc5\x9aakas occur again, more than once, which may be\npossibly unnecessary repetition: but these people, the Sakai and Sacae of\nclassical writers, the Indo-Scythians of Ptolemy, extended, about the\ncommencement of our era, along the west of India, from the Hindu Koh to the\nmouths of the Indus.\n\n[188:44](vp061.htm#fr_520) The inhabitants of Tirhut.\n\n[188:45](vp061.htm#fr_521) The people of South Bahar.\n\n[188:46](vp061.htm#fr_522) Also read Mahyas and Suhmas: the latter is probably\ncorrect. The Suhmas and Prasuhmas were found in the east by Bhima; and Suhma\nis elsewhere said to be situated east of Bengal, towards the sea, the king and\nthe people being Mlechchhas, that is not Hindus: it would correspond therefore\nwith Tiperah and Aracan.\n\n[188:47](vp061.htm#fr_523) Also read Malajas, but less correctly perhaps. The\nMalayas are the people of the southern Ghats.\n\n[188:48](vp061.htm#fr_524) We have Pravijayas in the east, according to the\nPuran\xcc\x81as.\n\n[188:49](vp061.htm#fr_525) Anga is the country about Bhagalpur, of which\nChampa was the capital.\n\n[188:50](vp061.htm#fr_526) Eastern Bengal.\n\n[188:51](vp061.htm#fr_527) We have had these before, but they are repeated\nperhaps in conformity to the usual classification, which connects them with\nthe two preceding, being derived in the genealogical lists from a common\nancestor.\n\n[188:52](vp061.htm#fr_528) In Bhima\'s Dig-vijaya we have two people of this\nname, both in the east; one along the foot of the Himalaya, and the other more\nto the south.\n\n[188:53](vp061.htm#fr_529) Uniformly read in the MSS. Sudeshn\xcc\x81a.\n\n[188:54](vp061.htm#fr_530) Three copies read Mahishas. We p. 189 have\nMahishakas amongst the southern people in the Puran\xcc\x81as; and a Mahishiki in the\nRamayan\xcc\x81a, also in the south: the latter may be connected with Mahishmati,\nwhich Sahadeva visits in his southern invasion, and which has been elsewhere\nconjectured to be in Mysur. (Calcutta Annual Register, 1822,) There is also a\nMahishmati on the road to the south (Mahabh. Udyoga P.), which is commonly\nidentified with Chuli Mahe\xc5\x9bwar, on the Narmada.\n\n[189:55](vp061.htm#fr_531) Also Rishikas; people placed by the Ramayan\xcc\x81a both\nin the north and in the south. Arjuna visits the former, and exacts from them\neight horses. Dig-vijaya.\n\n[189:56](vp061.htm#fr_532) Also read Bahikas, which we may here prefer, as the\nBahlikas are subsequently named: the former are described in the Mahabharata,\nKarn\xcc\x81a Parva, with some detail, and comprehend the different nations of the\nPunjab, from the Setlej to the Indus.\n\n[189:57](vp061.htm#fr_533) These are included amongst the northern nations;\nVayu, &c.; but in Nakula\'s Dig-vijaya they are in the west.\n\n[189:58](vp061.htm#fr_534) The \xc3\x81bhiras, according to the Puran\xcc\x81as, are also in\nthe north: in the Ramayan\xcc\x81a and Mahabh. Sabha P. they are in the west. The\nfact seems to be, that the people along the Indus, from Surat to the Himalaya,\nare often regarded as either western or northern nations, according to the\ntopographical position of the writer: in either case the same tribes are\nintended.\n\n[189:59](vp061.htm#fr_535) The MSS. read Kalatoyakas, a people placed by the\nPuran\xcc\x81as in the north.\n\n[189:60](vp061.htm#fr_536) The Vayu reads Aparitas, a northern nation. There\nare Aparytae in Herodotus, classed with a people bordering on India, the\nGandari. The term in the text signifies also borderers,\' and is probably\ncorrect, as opposed to the following word Parantas; the latter signifying\nthose beyond, and the former those not beyond the borders. The latter has for\nParantas, Paritas; and the Matsya, Paradas.\n\n[189:61](vp061.htm#fr_537) Also Pahlavas, a northern or northwestern nation,\noften mentioned in Hindu writings, in Manu, the Ramayan\xcc\x81a, the Puran\xcc\x81as, &c.\nThey were not a Hindu people, and may have been some of the tribes between\nIndia and Persia.\n\n[189:62](vp061.htm#fr_538) Also Charmakhan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikas, but the sense is the same;\nthose living in the district Man\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ala or Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a of Charma: they are a\nnorthern people: Vayu, &c. Pliny mentions a king of a people so called,\n"Charmarum rex."\n\n[189:63](vp061.htm#fr_539) Read Marubhaumas; more satisfactorily, as it means\nthe inhabitants of Marubhumi, \'the desert;\' the sands of Sindh.\n\n[189:64](vp061.htm#fr_540) Also Surasht\xcc\x81ras, which is no doubt more correct;\nthe inhabitants of Surat.\n\n[189:65](vp061.htm#fr_541) The Kekayas or Kaikeyas appear amongst the chief\nnations in the war of the Mahabharata, their king being a kinsman of Krishn\xcc\x81a.\nThe Ramayan\xcc\x81a, II. 53, specifies their position beyond, or west of, the\nVipa\xc5\x9ba.\n\n[190:66](vp061.htm#fr_542) We have in the Puran\xcc\x81as Kut\xcc\x81t\xcc\x81apracharan\xcc\x81as and\nKut\xcc\x81t\xcc\x81apravaran\xcc\x81as amongst the mountain tribes.\n\n[190:67](vp061.htm#fr_543) These may be people upon the Mahi river: they are\nnamed amongst the southern nations by the Vayu, &c., but the west is evidently\nintended.\n\n[190:68](vp061.htm#fr_544) Read also Kachchas: the Puran\xcc\x81a have Kachchiyas.\nThe form is equally applicable to people dwelling in districts contiguous to\nwater and in marshy spots, and denotes the province still called Cutch.\n\n[190:69](vp061.htm#fr_545) Also read Adhya, Antya, and Andhra: the latter is\nthe name of Telingana, the Andhri of Pliny.\n\n[190:70](vp061.htm#fr_546) Three MSS. have Malada, a people of the east in\nBhima\'s Dig-vijaya.\n\n[190:71](vp061.htm#fr_547) Also Manavalakas.\n\n[190:72](vp061.htm#fr_548) A people of the east.\n\n[190:73](vp061.htm#fr_549) The western provinces of Bengal, or, as sometimes\nused in a more comprehensive sense, it includes the following districts:\nRajshahi, Dinajpur, and Rangpur; Nadiya, Birbhum, Burdwan, part of Midnapur,\nand the Jungle Mahals; Ramgerh, Pachete, Palamow, and part of Chunar. See an\naccount of Pun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ra, translated from what is said to be part of the\nBrahman\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a section of the Bhavishyat Puran\xcc\x81a. Calcutta Quart. Mag. Dec. 1824.\n\n[190:74](vp061.htm#fr_550) There is considerable variety in this term, Larga,\nMarja, Samuttara, and Samantara; probably neither is correct. Bhargas are\namongst the people subdued in the east by Bhima.\n\n[190:75](vp061.htm#fr_551) These are foresters and barbarians in general.\n\n[190:76](vp061.htm#fr_552) Notwithstanding the celebrity of this country, as\nthe kingdom of Nala, it does not appear exactly where it was situated: we may\nconclude it was not far from Vidharba (Berar) as that was the country of\nDamayanti. From the directions given by Nala to Damayanti, it is near the\nVindhya mountain and Payoshn\xcc\x81i river, and roads lead from it across the Riksha\nmountain to Avanti and the south, as well as to Vidarbha and to Ko\xc5\x9bala.\nNalopakhyana, sec. 9.\n\n[190:77](vp061.htm#fr_553) These are always placed in the west: they are\nfabled to be the descendants of \xc3\x81nartta, the son of Saryati, who founded the\ncapital Ku\xc5\x9basthali afterwards Dwaraka, on the sea-shore in Guzerat.\n\n[190:78](vp061.htm#fr_554) Also Pratimatsyas; those opposite or adjacent to\nthe Matsyas.\n\n[190:79](vp061.htm#fr_555) Also Ku\xc5\x9bajas and Ko\xc5\x9balas; the latter is probably\ncorrect, as the name does not occur in any other form than that of Kasiko\xc5\x9bala\nabove. Ko\xc5\x9bala is a name variously applied. Its earliest and most celebrated\napplication is to the country on the banks of the Sar.ayu, the kingdom of\nRama, of which Ayodhya was the capital. Ramayan\xcc\x81a, I. s. 5. In the Mahabharata\nwe p. 191 have one Ko\xc5\x9bala in the east, and another in the south, besides the\nPrak-ko\xc5\x9balas and Uttara-ko\xc5\x9balas in the east and north, The Puran\xcc\x81as place the\nKo\xc5\x9balas amongst the people or the back of Vindhya;\' and it would appear from\nthe Vayu that Ku\xc5\x9ba, the son of Rama, transferred his kingdom to a more central\nposition; he ruled over Ko\xc5\x9bala at his capital of Ku\xc5\x9basthali or Ku\xc5\x9bavati, built\nupon the Vindhyan precipices: the same is alluded to in the Patala Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a of\nthe Padma Puran\xcc\x81a, and in the Raghu Van\xc5\x9ba, for the purpose of explaining the\nreturn of Ku\xc5\x9ba to Ayodhya. Certainly in later times the country of Ko\xc5\x9bala lay\nsouth of Oude, for in the Ratnavali the general of Vatsa surrounds the king of\nKo\xc5\x9bala in the Vindhya mountains: (Hindu Theatre, II. 305:) and, as noticed in\nthe same work, (p. 267,) we have in the Puran\xcc\x81as, Sapta Ko\xc5\x9balas, or seven\nKo\xc5\x9balas. An inscription found at Ratnapur in Chattisgarh, of which I have an\nunpublished translation, states that Sri-deva, the governor of Malahari\nMandala, having obtained the favour of Prithwideva, king of Ko\xc5\x9bala, was\nenabled to build temples, and dig tanks, &c., indicating the extension of the\npower of Ko\xc5\x9bala across the Ganges in that direction. The inscription is dated\nSamvat 915, or A. D. 858. The Ko\xc5\x9bala of the Puran\xcc\x81as and of the dramatic and\npoetic writers was however more to the west, along a part of the Vindhya\nrange. Ptolemy has a Kontakossula in the south, probably one of the Ko\xc5\x9balas of\nthe Hindus.\n\n[191:80](vp061.htm#fr_556) Also Itikas; perhaps the Ishikas or Aishikas of the\nVayu, &c. a people of the south.\n\n[191:81](vp061.htm#fr_557) The people of Kashmir.\n\n[191:82](vp061.htm#fr_558) One of the chief tribes engaged in the war of the\nMahabharata. The Ramayan\xcc\x81a places them in the west; the Puran\xcc\x81as in the north.\nThe term Sindhu shews their position to have been upon the Indus, apparently\nin the Punjab.\n\n[191:83](vp061.htm#fr_559) These are also a people of the northwest, found\nboth on the west of the Indus and in the Punjab, and well known to classical\nauthors as the Gandarii and Gandaridae. As. Res. XV. 103; also Journal of the\nR. As. Soc.; Account of the Foe-kue-ki.\n\n[191:84](vp061.htm#fr_560) From the context this should probably be Darvakas,\nthe people of a district usually specified in connexion with the succeeding.\n\n[191:85](vp061.htm#fr_561) These are the inhabitants of the country bordering\non Cashmir, to the south and west; known to the Greeks as the kingdom of\nAbisares. It often occurs in composition with Darya, as Darvabhisara. As. Res.\nXV. 24.\n\n[191:86](vp061.htm#fr_562) Also read Ulut\xcc\x81as and Kulut\xcc\x81as: the Ramayan\xcc\x81a has\nKolukas or Kaulut\xcc\x81as amongst the western tribes.\n\n[191:87](vp061.htm#fr_563) Also with the short vowel, \xc5\x9aaivalas.\n\n[191:88](vp061.htm#fr_564) The Vahlikas or Bahlikas are always associated with\nthe people of the north, west, and ultra-Indian provinces, and are usually\nconsidered to represent the Bactrians, or people of Balkh. It is specified in\nthe Mahabh. Udyoga P. as famous for its horses, a reputation the country\nbordering upon it, at least Bokhara and Maimena, still preserves: and in\nArjun\xcc\x81a\'s Dig-vijaya it is said to be difficult of approach.\n\n[191:89](vp061.htm#fr_565) These are probably intended for the p. 192\nneighbours of the Abhisaras: they are found in the north by Arjuna, Dig-\nvijaya, and are there termed also Kshatriyas.\n\n[192:90](vp061.htm#fr_566) Also read Bahubadhya and Bahurada.\n\n[192:91](vp061.htm#fr_567) The name occurs in the Ramayan\xcc\x81a as that of a\nmountain in the Punjab or in the Bahika country. II. 53.\n\n[192:92](vp061.htm#fr_568) The MSS. agree in reading this Vanayava or Vanayus,\na people in the northwest, also famous for horses.\n\n[192:93](vp061.htm#fr_569) A better reading is Dasapar\xc5\x9bwa, as we have had\nDa\xc5\x9barn\xcc\x81as before.\n\n[192:94](vp061.htm#fr_570) Also Ropan\xcc\x81as; quere, Romans?\n\n[192:95](vp061.htm#fr_571) Also Gachchas and Kachchas: the last is the best\nreading, although it has occurred before.\n\n[192:96](vp061.htm#fr_572) Also Gopala-kachchas: they are amongst the eastern\ntribes in Bhima\'s Dig-vijaya.\n\n[192:97](vp061.htm#fr_573) Or Langalas.\n\n[192:98](vp061.htm#fr_574) Kurujangalas, or the people of the forests in the\nupper part of the Doab: it is also read Paravallabhas.\n\n[192:99](vp061.htm#fr_575) The analogy to \'barbarians\' is not in sound only,\nbut in all the authorities these are classed with borderers and foreigners and\nnations not Hindu.\n\n[192:100](vp061.htm#fr_576) Also Dahas, in which we should have a resemblance\nto the Scythian Dahae.\n\n[192:101](vp061.htm#fr_577) Or Tamaliptas or Damaliptas; the people at the\nwestern mouth of the Ganges in Medinipur and Tamluk. Tamralipti was a\ncelebrated sea-port in the fourth century, (Account of the Poe-kue-ki,) and\nretained its character in the ninth and twelfth. Da\xc5\x9ba Kumara Charitra and\nVrihat Katha; also Journ. Royal As. Soc.\n\n[192:102](vp061.htm#fr_578) The people of Odra or Orissa.\n\n[192:103](vp061.htm#fr_579) The inhabitants of Pun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ra: see note 73.\n\n[192:104](vp061.htm#fr_580) The people of the Coromandel coast, from Madras\nsouthwards; those by whom the Tamil language is spoken.\n\n[192:105](vp061.htm#fr_581) The people of Malabar proper.\n\n[192:106](vp061.htm#fr_582) Also Prasyas. Prachyas properly means the people\nof the east, the Prasii of the Greeks, east of the Ganges.\n\n[192:107](vp061.htm#fr_583) Mushika is the southernmost part of the Malabar\ncoast, Cochin and Travancore.\n\n[192:108](vp061.htm#fr_584) Also Vanavasinas and Vanavasikas; the inhabitants\nof Banawasi, the Banavasi of Ptolemy, a town the remains of which are still\nextant in the district of Sunda.\n\n[192:109](vp061.htm#fr_585) The people of the centre of the Peninsula, the\nproper Kernata or Carnatie.\n\n[192:110](vp061.htm#fr_586) The people of Mysore: see note 54.\n\n[192:111](vp061.htm#fr_587) Also Vikalpas.\n\n[192:112](vp061.htm#fr_588) Also Pushkalas,\n\n[192:113](vp061.htm#fr_589) Also Karn\xcc\x81ikas.\n\n[192:114](vp061.htm#fr_590) Read Kuntikas.\n\n[193:115](vp061.htm#fr_591) Variously read Nalakalaka, Nabhakanana, and\nTilakanija.\n\n[193:116](vp061.htm#fr_592) Kaukundaka and Kaukuntaka.\n\n[193:117](vp061.htm#fr_593) The inhabitants of the lower part of the\nCoromandel coast; so called after them Chola-man\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ala.\n\n[193:118](vp061.htm#fr_594) People of the Konkan: according to some statements\nthere are seven districts so named.\n\n[193:119](vp061.htm#fr_595) Malavanara and \xc5\x9aalavan\xcc\x81aka.\n\n[193:120](vp061.htm#fr_596) These two words are sometimes compounded as\nKukkurangara: it is also read Kanurajada.\n\n[193:121](vp061.htm#fr_597) This is a questionable name, though the MSS.\nagree. We have in Arjuna\'s Dig-vijaya, Utsavamanketa; and in Nakula\'s, to the\nwest, Utsavasanketa.\n\n[193:122](vp061.htm#fr_598) These are amongst the warriors of the Mahabharata;\nthey are included in all the lists amongst the northern tribes, and are\nmentioned in the Rajatarangini as not far from Kashmir: they are considered to\nbe the people of Lahone.\n\n[193:123](vp061.htm#fr_599) Also Vyukas and Vrikas: the latter are specified\namongst the central nations: Vayu, &c.\n\n[193:124](vp061.htm#fr_600) Kokavakas and Kokanakhas.\n\n[193:125](vp061.htm#fr_601) \xc5\x9aaras and Vegasaras; also Parasancharakas.\n\n[193:126](vp061.htm#fr_602) Vindhyapalakas and Vindhyamulikas: the latter,\nthose at the foot of Vindhya, are named in the Pauran\xcc\x81ik lists amongst the\nsouthern tribes.\n\n[193:127](vp061.htm#fr_603) Balwala and Valkaja.\n\n[193:128](vp061.htm#fr_604) Also Malaka and Majava.\n\n[193:129](vp061.htm#fr_605) Also Vallabhas, which from the succeeding word may\nbe conjectured to be correct. A city named Vallabhi makes a great figure in\nthe traditions of Rajputana. See Tod\'s Rajasthan.\n\n[193:130](vp061.htm#fr_606) One of the tribes in the west or north-west\nsubdued by Arjuna.\n\n[193:131](vp061.htm#fr_607) Kalada and Dohada.\n\n[193:132](vp061.htm#fr_608) Kundala, Karantha, and Man\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81aka: the latter\noccurs in the Ramayan\xcc\x81a amongst the eastern nations.\n\n[193:133](vp061.htm#fr_609) Kurat\xcc\x81a, Kunaka.\n\n[193:134](vp061.htm#fr_610) Stanabala.\n\n[193:135](vp061.htm#fr_611) Satirtha, Satiya, Nariya.\n\n[193:136](vp061.htm#fr_612) The \xc5\x9arinjayas are a people from the north-west\namongst the warriors of the Mahabharata: the reading may be incorrect. It\noccurs also Putisrinjaya.\n\n[193:137](vp061.htm#fr_613) Also Aninda.\n\n[193:138](vp061.htm#fr_614) Also Sivata, Sirala, Syuvaka.\n\n[193:139](vp061.htm#fr_615) Tanapa, Stanapa, Sutapa.\n\n[193:140](vp061.htm#fr_616) Pallipanjaka and Vidarbha.\n\n[193:141](vp061.htm#fr_617) Dadhividarbha, but three copies have Rishika.\nGreat variety, and no doubt great inaccuracy, prevails in the MSS. in several\nof the names ]sere given: they are not found elsewhere.\n\n[193:142](vp061.htm#fr_618) The reading of three copies is Kakas: there is a\ntribe so called on the banks of the Indus, as it leaves the mountains.\n\n[193:143](vp061.htm#fr_619) These and the following are mountaineers p. 194 in\nthe north-west. The former are placed by the Puran\xcc\x81as in the north, and the\nVayu includes them also amongst the mountain tribes. The Ramayan\xcc\x81a has\nTankanas in the north.\n\n[194:144](vp061.htm#fr_620) The term Yavanas, although in later times applied\nto the Mohammedans, designated formerly the Greeks, as observed in the\nvaluable notes on the translation of the Birth of Uma, from the Kumara\nSambhava. (Journal As. Soc. of Bengal, July 1833.) The Greeks were known\nthroughout western Asia by the term \xd7\x95 \xd7\x99\xd7\x95\xd7\x9f, Yavan; or Ion, \xe1\xbc\xb8\xce\xb1\xce\xbf\xce\xbd\xce\xb5\xcf\x82; the Yavana,\n###, of the Hindus; or as it occurs in its Prakrit form, in the very curious\ninscription decyphered by Mr. Prinsep, (J. As. Soc. Beng. Feb. 1838,) Yona:\nthe term Yona Raja being there associated with the name Antiochus, in all\nlikelihood Antiochus the Great, the ally of the Indian prince Sophagasenas,\nabout B. C. 210. That the Macedonian or Bactrian Greeks were most usually\nintended is not only probable from their position and relations with India,\nbut from their being usually named in concurrence with the north-western\ntribes, Kambojas, Daradas, Paradas, Bahlikas, \xc5\x9aakas, &c. in the Ramayan\xcc\x81a,\nMahabharata, Puran\xcc\x81as, Manu, and in various poems and plays.\n\n[194:145](vp061.htm#fr_621) Chinas, or Chinese, or rather the people of\nChinese Tartary, are named in the Ramayan\xcc\x81a and Manu, as well as in the\nPuran\xcc\x81as. If the designation China was derived from the Tsin dynasty, which\ncommenced B. C. 260, this forms a limit of antiquity for the works in\nquestion. The same word however, or Tsin, was the ancient appellation of the\nnorthern province of Shen-sy, and it may have reached the Hindus from thence\nat an earlier period.\n\n[194:146](vp061.htm#fr_622) These Wilford regards as the people of Arachosia.\nThey are always mentioned together with the north-western tribes, Yavanas,\n\xc5\x9aakas, and the like: they are also famous for their hoses; and in the\nRamayan\xcc\x81a they are said to be covered with golden lotuses. What is meant is\ndoubtful, probably some ornament or embellishment of their dress. We have part\nof the name, or Kambi, in the Cambistholi of Arrian: the last two syllables,\nno doubt, represent the Sanscrit Sthala, \'place,\' \'district;\' and the word\ndenotes the dwellers in the Kamba or Kambis country: so Kamboja may be\nexplained those born in Kamba or Kambas.\n\n[194:147](vp061.htm#fr_623) Also \xc5\x9aakridvaha or \xc5\x9aakridguha.\n\n[194:148](vp061.htm#fr_624) Also Kulachchas and Kuntalas: the Puran\xcc\x81as have\nKupathas amongst the mountain tribes.\n\n[194:149](vp061.htm#fr_625) Also Parataka: the first is not a common form in\nthe Puran\xcc\x81as, although it is in poetical writings, denoting, no doubt, the\nPersians, or people of Pars or Fars: the latter, also read Paradas, may imply\nthe same, as beyond (Para) the Indus.\n\n[194:150](vp061.htm#fr_626) We have Ramathas in Nakula\'s Dig-vijaya, and in\nthe Vayu and Matsya.\n\n[194:151](vp061.htm#fr_627) Da\xc5\x9bamanas and De\xc5\x9bamanikas, in the north: Vayu and\nMatsya.\n\n[194:152](vp061.htm#fr_628) The passage occurs in the Vayu and Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya\nPuran\xcc\x81as, as well as in the Mahabharata; but the purport is not very distinct,\nand the proper reading is doubtful. p. 195 In three MSS. of the latter it\noccurs ### the latter pada is the same in all: the former, is ### in a fourth\ncopy, in two copies of the Vayu it is ###. None of these are intelligible, and\nthe Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya furnishes the reading followed, Modern geographers have\nsupposed the Cathaei, Cathari, and Chatriaei of the ancients, in the lower\nparts of the Punjab, to mean a people of Kshatriyas; but no such people occur\ndirectly named in our lists. Considering that the text is speaking of\nbarbarous and foreign tribes, perhaps no particular nation is here meant, and\nit may be intended as an epithet of those which follow, or of Vai\xc5\x9bya\n(agricultural) and \xc5\x9audra (servile or low) tribes, living either near to, or\nafter the manner of Kshatriyas: in that case a better reading would be, ###.\nAccording to Manu, various northern tribes, the \xc5\x9aakas, Kambojas, Paradas,\nPahlavas, Kiratas, Daradas, and Khasas, and even the Chinas and Yavanas, are\ndegraded Kshatriyas, in consequence of neglecting religious rites. X. 43, 44.\nAccording to the Pauran\xcc\x81ik legend they were overcome in war by Sagara, and\ndegraded from their original caste. See book IV.\n\n[195:153](vp061.htm#fr_629) Here we have a people called \xc5\x9audras by all the\nauthorities, and placed in the west or north-west, towards the Indus. They\nhave been ingeniously, and with probability, conjectured by Mr. Lassen to be\nthe Oxydracae; for \xc5\x9audraka is equally correct with \xc5\x9audra; and in place of\n\xe1\xbd\x88\xce\xbe\xcf\x85\xce\xb4\xcf\x81\xce\xac\xce\xba\xce\xb1\xce\xb9 various MSS. of Strabo, as quoted by Siebenkees, read \xce\xa3\xce\xb9\xce\xb4\xcf\x81\xce\xac\xce\xba\xce\xb1\xce\xb9 and\n\xce\xa3\xcf\x85\xce\xb4\xcf\x81\xce\xac\xce\xba\xce\xb1\xce\xb9: the latter is precisely the Sanscrit appellation. Pliny also has\nSudraci for the people who formed the limit of Alexander\'s eastern conquests,\nor those hitherto inaccurately called Oxydracae.\n\n[195:154](vp061.htm#fr_630) These are always conjoined with the \xc5\x9audras, as if\nconterminous. Their situation is no doubt correctly indicated by Ptolemy by\nthe position of Abiria above Pattalene on the Indus.\n\n[195:155](vp061.htm#fr_631) The Durds are still where they were at the date of\nour text, and in the days of Strabo and Ptolemy; not exactly, indeed, at the\nsources of the Indus, but along its course, above the Himalaya, just before it\ndescends to India; a position which might well be taken for its head.\n\n[195:156](vp061.htm#fr_632) Also read Pa\xc5\x9bus, \'brutes.\' If the term might be\naltered to Palli, it would imply \'village or pastoral tribes.\'\n\n[195:157](vp061.htm#fr_633) Also Khasikas and Khasakas. The first of these is\nprobably most correct, being equivalent to Khasas, barbarians named along with\nthe \xc5\x9aakas and Daradas by Manu, &c.; traces of whom may be sought amongst the\nbarbarous tribes on the north-east of Bengal, the Kasiyas; or it has been\nthought that they may be referred to the situation of Kashgar. Two copies\nhave, in place of this, Tukharas, and the same occurs in the Ramayan\xcc\x81a; the\nVayu has Tusharas, but the Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya, Tukhara: these are probably the\nTochari, Tachari, or Thogari, a tribe of the \xc5\x9aakas, by whom Bactria was taken\nfrom the Greeks, and from whom Tocharestan derives the name it still bears.\n\n[195:158](vp061.htm#fr_634) Also Pahlavas and Pallavas. The form in the text\nis the more usual.\n\n[196:159](vp061.htm#fr_635) The Ramayan\xcc\x81a has Gahvaras. The mountains from\nKabul to Bamian furnish infinitely numerous instances of cavern habitations.\n\n[196:160](vp061.htm#fr_636) These two, according to the Vayu, are amongst the\nnorthern nations; but they might be thought to be religious fraternities, from\nthe sages Atri and Bharadwaja.\n\n[196:161](vp061.htm#fr_637) The latter member of the compound occurs poshikas,\npayikas, and yodhikas, \'cherishers,\' \'drinkers,\' or \'fighters:\' the first term\ndenotes the female breast.\n\n[196:162](vp061.htm#fr_638) Also Dron\xcc\x81akas, \'people of vallies.\'\n\n[196:163](vp061.htm#fr_639) Also Kajingas. Kalingas would be here out of\nplace.\n\n[196:164](vp061.htm#fr_640) These and the preceding are included by the Vayu\namongst the mountain tribes of the north.\n\n[196:165](vp061.htm#fr_641) Many names indeed might be added to the catalogue\nfrom the lists referred to in the Vayu, Matsya, and Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya Puran\xcc\x81as, as\nwell as several capable of verification from the Ramayan\xcc\x81a, and other passages\nof the Mahabharata. This is not the place however to exhaust the subject, and\nit has been prosecuted too far perhaps already. It is evident that a very\nconsiderable proportion of the names recorded can be verified, and that many\nof them may be traced in the geographical notices of India left by the\nhistorians of Alexander\'s expedition. That more cannot be identified is owing\nin a great measure to incomplete research; and a more extensive examination of\nthe authorities would no doubt discover passages where circumstances, as well\nas names, are given by which the places would be recognised. It is evident,\nhowever, that much embarrassment also arises from the inaccuracy of\nmanuscripts, which vary widely and irreconcilably. I have given instances from\nfour different copies of the text; one in my own possession, three in the\nlibrary of the East India Company; all very excellent copies, but manifestly\nerroneous in many respects in their nomenclature of places, and particularly\nof those which are least known. No assistance is to be had from any\ncommentary, as the subject is one of little interest in native estimation.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter IV](vp062.htm)\n\n'
