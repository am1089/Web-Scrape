The Pu _m_ savana (ceremony to cause the birth of a male) must be\nperformed before the embryo begins to move.\n\n3\\. The Simantonnayana (ceremony of parting the hair) should take place in the\nsixth or eighth month (of pregnancy).\n\n4\\. The _G_ atakarman (birth-ceremony) should take place on the birth of the\nchild.\n\n5\\. The Namadheya (naming-rite) must be performed as soon as the term of\nimpurity (caused by the birth of the child) is over.\n\n6\\. (The name to be chosen should be) auspicious in the case of a Brahma _n_\na;\n\n7\\. Indicating power in the case of a Kshatriya;\n\n8\\. Indicating wealth in the case of a Vai _s_ ya;\n\n9\\. Indicating contempt in the case of a _S_ udra.\n\n[1. 1 'Garbha' here means ' _ri_ tu,' i.e. the time favourable for\nprocreation, following immediately upon the menstrual evacuation, and the\nabove ceremony should be performed once only, in order to consecrate the\nmother once for all. (Nand.)\n\n2, 3. The embryo begins to move in the fourth month of pregnancy, and the Pu\n_m_ savana must be performed in the second or third month of every pregnancy.\nThus Nand., who combats expressly the opinion that this ceremony has the\nconsecration of the mother, and not the consecration of the f\xc2\x9ctus, for its\nobject. Regarding the Simantonnayana he seems to consider both views as\nadmissible. According to the former view it would have to be performed only\nonce, like the Nishekakarman.\n\n6-9. Nand. quotes as instances of such names: 1. Lakshmidhara; 2. Yudhish _th_\nira; 3. Arthapati; 4. Lokadasa or (observing, {footnote p. 116} at the same\ntime, another rule regarding the second part of a compound name), 1. Vish _n_\nu _s_ arman; 2. Bhimavarman; 3. Devagupta; 4. Dharmadasa.]\n\np. 114\n\n10\\. The \xc3\x82dityadar _s_ ana, (ceremony of taking the child out to see the sun)\nshould take place in the fourth month (after birth).\n\n11\\. The Annapra _s_ ana (ceremony of first feeding) should take place in the\nsixth month.\n\n12\\. The Ku _d_ akara _n_ a '(tonsure rite) should take place in the third\nyear [1].\n\n13\\. For female children the same ceremonies, (beginning with the birth\nceremony, should be performed, but) without Mantras.\n\n14\\. The marriage ceremony only has to be performed with Mantras for them.\n\n15\\. The initiation of Brahma _n_ as (should take plate) in the eighth year\nafter conception[1];\n\n16\\. Of Kshatriyas, in the eleventh year after conception[1];\n\n17\\. Of Vaisyas,, in the twelfth year after conception[1];\n\n18\\. Their girdles should be made of Mu\xc3\xb1 _g_ a grass, a bow-string, and Balba\n_g_ a (coarse grass) respectively.\n\n19\\. Their sacrificial strings and their garments should be made of cotton,\nhemp, and wool respectively.\n\n[10. According to Nand., who quotes a passage of Yama in support of his\nopinion, this Sutra has to be divided into two, which would, however, require\nseveral words to complete their sense, the import of the first being, that the\nchild should be taken out to see the sun in the third month, and to see the\nmoon in the fourth month. See the Introduction.\n\n12\\. 1 'The third year,' i. e. either after conception, or after birth.\n(Nand.)\n\n15-17. 1 'Nand., 'or after birth.' See Par. and \xc3\x82 _s_ v. loc. cit.]\n\np. 115\n\n20\\. The skins (which they wear) should be those of a black antelope, of a\ntiger, and of a he-goat respectively.\n\n2 1. Their staves should be made of Pala _s_ a, Khadira, and Udumbara wood\nrespectively.\n\n22\\. Their staves should be of such a length as to reach the hair, the\nforehead, and the nose respectively.\n\n23\\. Or all (kinds of staves may be used for all castes indiscriminately).\n\n24\\. And they should not be crooked, nor should the bark be stripped off.\n\n25\\. In begging alms, they should put in the word 'Lady' at the beginning, in\nthe middle, and at the end of their request (according to their caste).\n\n26\\. The ceremony of initiation must not be delayed beyond the sixteenth year\nin the case of a Brahma _n_ a; beyond the twenty-second, in the case of a\nKshatriya; and beyond the twenty-fourth, in the case of a Vai _s_ ya.\n\n27\\. After that, the youths belonging to any of those three castes, who have\nnot been initiated at the proper time, are excluded from initiation, and\ncontemned by the twice-born, and are called Vratyas.\n\n28\\. That skin, that cord, that girdle, that staff, and that garment which has\nbeen given to any one (on his initiation), that he must for ever wear when\nperforming any religious observance.\n\n29\\. His girdle, his skin, his staff, his string, and his ewer he must throw\ninto the water when broken (or spoiled by use), and receive others consecrated\nwith Mantras.\n\np. 116\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XXVIII.](sbe07030.htm)\n\n"
