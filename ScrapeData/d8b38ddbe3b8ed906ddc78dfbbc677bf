Agni kindled has sent his light to the sky; turned towards the dawn he\nshines far and wide. (The sacrificial ladle) goes forward with adoration, rich\nin all treasures, magnifying the gods with sacrificial food.\n\n2\\. Being kindled thou reignest over immortality; thou attendest for welfare\nthe man who prepares the sacrificial food. He whom thou furtherest, acquires\nall wealth and puts in front hospitality (towards thee), O Agni\n[1](sbe46132.htm#an_5:28:2:1).\n\n3\\. Agni, show thy prowess for the sake of great bliss. May thy splendours be\nhighest. Make our householdership easy to conduct\n[1](sbe46132.htm#an_5:28:3:1). Set thy foot on the greatness of those who show\nenmity to us.\n\n4\\. I adore thy beauty, Agni, who hast been kindled, who art highly exalted. A\nbull, brilliant art thou. Thou art kindled at the sacrifices.\n\n5\\. Being kindled, Agni into whom offerings are poured, sacrifice to the gods,\nbest sacrificer, for thou art the carrier of oblations.\n\n6\\. Sacrifice into (Agni); exalt Agni, while the sacrifice is going on. Choose\nhim for your carrier of oblations.\n\np. 424\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe _Ri_ shi is Vi _s_ vavara \xc3\x82treyi (cf. verse 1); the metre is Trish _t_ ubh\nin verses 1 and 3, _G_ agati in verse 2, Anush _t_ ubh in verse 4, Gayatri in\nverses 5 and 6. Verse 3 = AV. VII, 73, 10; VS. XXXIII, 12; TS. II, 4, 1, 1; 5,\n2, 4; MS. IV, 11, 1. Verse 5 = TS. II, 5, 8, 6. Verses 5-6 = TB. III, 5, 2, 3.\n\nThe Sukta is a later addition to the original Sa _m_ hita.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Should not dhatte be accented? 'He whom thou furtherest and (who) puts\nin front hospitality (towards thee), O Agni, acquires all wealth.'\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Cf. X, 85, 23. sam _g_ aspatyam suyamam astu deva _h_. The additions\nto the single Ma _n_ _d_ alas seem, as a rule, to be of later origin than the\nhymns of the tenth Ma _n_ _d_ ala (see H. O., Prolegomena, p. 265); so it may\nbe conjectured that the author of our verse imitated that passage of the great\nmarriage hymn.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Introduction to Appendices](sbe46133.htm)\n\n"
