Now the oblations of cooked food on the (two) Parvan (i.e. the new and\nfull moon) days.\n\n2\\. The fasting (which takes place) thereat has been declared by (the\ncorresponding rules regarding) the Dar _s_ apur _n_ amasa sacrifices.\n\np. 173\n\n3 3. And (so has been declared) the binding together of the fuel and of the\nBarhis,\n\n4 4. And the deities (to whom those oblations belong), with the exception of\nthe Upa _m_ _s_ uya _g_ a (offerings at which the formulas are repeated with\nlow voice), and of Indra and Mahendra.\n\n5\\. Other deities (may be worshipped) according to the wishes (which the\nsacrificer connects with his offerings).\n\n6\\. For each single deity he pours out four handsful (of rice, barley, &c.),\nplacing two purifiers (i.e. Ku _s_ a blades, on the vessel), with (the\nformula), 'Agreeable to such and such (a deity) I pour thee out.'\n\n7\\. He then sprinkles them (those four portions of Havis with water) in the\nsame way as he had poured them out, with (the formula), 'Agreeable to such and\nsuch (a deity) I sprinkle thee.'\n\n8\\. When (the rice or barley grains) have been husked and cleansed from the\nhusks three times, let him cook (the four portions) separately,\n\n9\\. Or throwing (them) together.\n\n10\\. If he cooks them separately, let him touch the grains, after he has\nseparated them, (and say,) 'This to this god; this to this god.'\n\n11\\. But if he (cooks the portions) throwing (them) together, he should (touch\nand) sacrifice them, after he has put (the single portions) into different\nvessels.\n\n12 12. The portions of sacrificial food, when they\n\np. 174\n\nhave been cooked, he sprinkles (with \xc3\x82 _g_ ya, takes them from the fire\ntowards the north, places them on the Barhis, and sprinkles the fuel with \xc3\x82\n_g_ ya with the formula, 'This fuel is thy self, _G_ atavedas; thereby burn\nthou and increase, and, O burning One, make us increase and through offspring,\ncattle, holy lustre, and nourishment make us prosper. Svaha!'\n\n13 13. Having silently poured out the two \xc3\x82gharas (or \xc3\x82 _g_ ya oblations\npoured out with the Sruva, the one from north-west to south-east, the other\nfrom south-west to north-east), he should sacrifice the two \xc3\x82 _g_ ya portions\nwith (the formulas), 'To Agni svaha! To Soma svaha!'\xc2\x97\n\n14 14. The northern one belonging to Agni, the southern one to Soma.\n\n15 15. It is understood (in the _S_ ruti), The two eyes indeed of the\nsacrifice are the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya portions,\n\n16 16. 'Therefore of a man who is sitting with his face to the west the\nsouthern (i.e. right) eye is northern, the northern (i.e. left) eye is\nsouthern.'\n\n17 17. In the middle (of the two \xc3\x82 _g_ ya portions he\n\np. 175\n\nsacrifices the other) Havis, or more to the west, finishing (the oblations) in\nthe east or in the north.\n\n18\\. To the north-east the oblation to (Agni) Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t.\n\n19 19-20. He cuts off (the Avadana portions) from the Havis from the middle\nand from the eastern part;\n\n20\\. From the middle, the eastern part and the western part (the portions have\nto be cut off) by those who make five Avadanas;\n\n21\\. From the northern side the portion for Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t.\n\n22 22. Here he omits the second pouring (of \xc3\x82 _g_ ya) over (what is left of)\nthe sacrificial food.\n\n23 23. 'What I have done too much in this ceremony, or what I have done here\ntoo little, all that may Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t, he who knows it, make well\nsacrificed and well offered for me. To Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t, to him who\noffers the oblations for general expiation, so that they are well offered, to\nhim who makes us succeed in what we desire! Make us in all that we desire\nsuccessful! Svaha!'\n\n24 24. He pours out the full vessel on the Barhis.\n\n25 25. This is the Avabh _ri_ tha.\n\np. 176\n\n26\\. This is the standard form of the Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as.\n\n27\\. What has been left of the Havis is the fee for the sacrifice.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[173:3](sbe29109.htm#fr_409) 10, 3.

The object of\nthis passage is, in my opinion, to explain why the southern \xc3\x82 _g_ yabhaga\nbelongs to Soma, who is the presiding deity of the north, and the northern \xc3\x82\n_g_ yabhaga to Agni, the presiding deity of the south-east. Professor\nStenzler's opinion about this paragraph is somewhat different.\n\n[174:17](sbe29109.htm#fr_416) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh.-G _ri_ hya I, 9, 8.\n\n[175:19-20](sbe29109.htm#fr_417) 19, 20.
