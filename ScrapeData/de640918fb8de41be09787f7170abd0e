XXVII.\n\nPradyumna stolen by Sambara; thrown into the sea, and swallowed by a fish;\nfound by Mayadevi: he kills Sambara, marries Mayadevi, and returns with her to\nDwaraka. Joy of Rukmini and Krishn\xcc\x81a.\n\nMAITREYA.--How, Muni, happened it that the hero Pradyumna was carried away by\nSambara? and in what manner was the mighty Sambara killed by Pradyumna?\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--When Pradyumna was but six days old, he was stolen from the lying-\nin chamber by Sambara, terrible as death; for the demon foreknew that\nPradyumna, if he lived, would be his destroyer. Taking away the boy, Sambara\ncast him into the ocean, swarming with monsters, into a whirlpool of roaring\nwaves, the haunt of the huge creatures of the deep. A large fish swallowed the\nchild, but he died not, and was born anew from its belly 1: for that fish,\nwith others, was caught by the fishermen, and delivered by them to the great\nAsura Sambara. His wife Mayadevi, the mistress of his household, superintended\nthe operations of the cooks, and saw, when the fish was cut open, a beautiful\nchild, looking like a new shoot of the blighted tree of love. Whilst wondering\nwho this should be, and how he could have got into the belly of the fish,\nNarada came to satisfy her curiosity, and said to the graceful dame, "This is\nthe son of him by whom the whole world is created and destroyed, the son of\nVishn\xcc\x81u, who was stolen by Sambara from the lying-in chamber, and tossed by\nhim into the sea, where he was swallowed by the fish. He is now in thy power;\ndo thou, beautiful woman, tenderly rear this jewel of mankind." Thus\ncounselled by Narada, Mayadevi took charge of the boy, and carefully reared\nhim from childhood, being fascinated by the beauty of his person. Her\naffection became still more impassioned when he was decorated with the bloom\nof adolescence. The gracefully-moving Mayavati then, fixing her heart\n\np. 576\n\nand eyes upon the high-minded Pradyumna, gave him, whom she regarded as\nherself, all her magic (and illusive) powers.\n\nObserving these marks of passionate affection, the son of Krishn\xcc\x81a said to the\nlotus-eyed Mayadevi, "Why do you indulge in feelings so unbecoming the\ncharacter of a mother?" To which she replied, "Thou art not a son of mine;\nthou art the son of Vishn\xcc\x81u, whom Kala Sambara carried away, and threw into\nthe sea: thou vast swallowed by a fish, but wast rescued by me from its belly.\nThy fond mother, O beloved, is still weeping for thee." When the valiant\nPradyumna heard this, he was filled with wrath, and defied Sambara to battle.\nIn the conflict that ensued, the son of Madhava slew the whole host of\nSambara. Seven times he foiled the delusions of the enchanter, and making\nhimself master of the eighth, turned it against Sambara, and killed him. By\nthe same faculty he ascended into the air, and proceeded to his father\'s\nhouse, where he alighted, along with Mayavati, in the inner apartments. When\nthe women beheld Pradyumna, they thought it was Krishn\xcc\x81a himself. Rukmini, her\neyes dimmed with tears, spoke tenderly to him, and said, "Happy is she who has\na son like this, in the bloom of youth. Such would be the age of my son\nPradyumna, if he was alive. Who is the fortunate mother adorned by thee? and\nyet from thy appearance, and from the affection I feel for thee, thou art\nassuredly the son of Hari."\n\nAt this moment Krishn\xcc\x81a, accompanied by Narada, arrived; and the latter said\nto the delighted Rukmini, "This is thine own son, who has come hither after\nkilling Sambara, by whom, when an infant, he was stolen from the lying-in\nchamber. This is the virtuous Mayavati, his wife, and not the wife of Sambara.\nHear the reason. When Manmatha, the deity of love, had perished 2, the goddess\nof beauty, desirous to secure\n\np. 577\n\nhis revival, assumed a delusive form, and by her charms fascinated the demon\nSambara, and exhibited herself to him in various illusory enjoyments. This thy\nson is the descended Kama; and this is the goddess Rati, his wife 3. There is\nno occasion for any uncertainty: this is thy daughter-in-law." Then Rukmini\nwas glad, and Ke\xc5\x9bava also; the whole city resounded with exclamations of joy,\nand all the people of Dwaraka were surprised at Rukmini\'s recovering a son who\nhad so long been lost.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[575:1](vp144.htm#fr_1539) The Bhagavata tells the story in the same manner,\nbut the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba omits the part of the fish.\n\n[576:2](vp144.htm#fr_1540) When he was reduced to ashes by a fiery glance from\n\xc5\x9aiva, in resentment of his inflaming him with passion for Uma. This legend is\na favourite with the \xc5\x9aaiva Puran\xcc\x81as, and is told in the Linga and Kalika, also\nin the Padma P. and Ka\xc5\x9bi Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a of the Skanda P. They do not say much about\nhis resuscitation however; \xc5\x9aiva, in pity of Rati\'s grief, restoring him only\nto a bodiless existence as Ananga, whose place is to be in the hearts of men.\nThe Linga adds, that when Vishn\xcc\x81u, in consequence of the curse of Bhrigu,\nshall be born as the son of Vasudeva, Kama shall be born as one of his sons.\n\n[577:3](vp144.htm#fr_1541) The daughter of Daksha, but not enumerated amongst\nthose formerly specified ([p. 54](vp041.htm#page_54)): she was born from his\nperspiration, according to the Kalika P.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXVIII](vp145.htm)\n\n'
