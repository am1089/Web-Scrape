 \nOr like the bed of Ocean dried  \nOf his broad floods from side to side,  \nOr helpless, as the dying fire,  \nHushed his last words of righteous ire.  \nThen Rama, with his spirit moved,  \nThe Vanar king in turn reproved:  \n\'Why dost thou Bali, thus revile,  \nAnd castest not a glance the while  \nOn claims of duty, love, and gain,  \nAnd customs o\'er the world that reign?  \nWhy dost thou blame me, rash and blind,  \nFickle as all thy Vanar kind.  \nSlighting each rule of ancient days  \nWhich all the good and prudent praise?  \nThis land, each hill and woody chase,  \nBelongs to old Ikshvaku\'s race:  \n\nWith bird and beast and man, the whole  \nIs ours to cherish and control.  \nNow Bharat, prompt at duty\'s call,  \nWise, just, and true, is lord of all.  \nEach claim of law, love, gain he knows,  \nAnd wrath and favour duly shows.  \nA king from truth who never bends,  \nAnd grace with vigour wisely blends;  \nWith valour worthy of his race,  \nHe knows the claims of time and place,  \nNow we and other kings of might,  \nBy his ensample taught aright,  \nThe lands of every region tread  \nThat justice may increase and spread.  \nWhile royal Bharat, wise and just,  \nRules the broad earth, his glorious trust,  \nWho shall attempt, while he is lord,  \nA deed by Justice held abhorred?  \nWe now, as Bharat has decreed,  \nLet justice guide our every deed,  \nAnd toil each sinner to repress  \nWho scorns the way of righteousness.  \nThou from that path hast turned aside,  \nAnd virtue\'s holy law defied.  \nLeft the fair path which kings should tread,  \nAnd followed pleasure\'s voice instead.  \nThe man who cleaves to duty\'s law  \nRegards these three with filial awe--  \nThe sire, the elder brother, third  \nHim from whose lips his lore he heard.  \nThus too, for duty\'s sake, the wise  \nRegard with fond paternal eyes  \nThe well-loved younger brother, one  \nTheir lore has ripened, and a son.  \nFine are the laws which guide the good,  \nAbstruse, and hardly understood;  \nOnly the soul, enthroned within  \nThe breast of each, knows right from sin  \nBut thou art wild and weak of soul,  \nAnd spurnest, like thy race, control;  \nThe true and right thou canst not find.  \nTht blind consulting with the blind.  \nIncline thine ear and I will teach  \nThe cause that prompts my present speech  \nThis tempest of thy soul assuage  \nNor blame me in thine idle rage.  \nOn this great sin thy thoughts bestow,  \nThe sin for which I lay thee low.  \nThou, Bali, in thy brother\'s life  \nHast robbed him of his wedded wife,  \nAnd keepest, scorning ancient right,  \nHis Ruma for thine own delight.  \nThy son\'s own wife should scarcely be  \nMore sacred in thine eyes than she.  \nAll duty thou hast scorned, and hence  \nComes punishment for dire offence.  \nFor those who blindly do amiss  \nThere is, I ween, no way but this:  \nTo check the rash who dare to stray  \nFrom custom which the good obey,  \nI may not, sprung of Kshatriya line,  \n\np. 347  \n\nForgive this heinous sin of thine:  \nThe laws for those who sin like thee  \nThe penalty of death decree.  \nNow Bharat rules with sovereign sway,  \nAnd we his royal word obey.  \nTnere was no hope of pardon, none,  \nFor the vile deed that thou hast done,  \nThat wisest monarch dooms to die  \nThe wretch whose crimes the law defy;  \nAnd we, chastising those who err,  \nHis righteous doom administer.  \nMv soul accounts Sugriva dear  \nE\'en as my brother Lakshman here.  \nHe brings me blessing, and I swore  \nhis wife and kingdom to restore:  \nA bond in solemn honour bound  \nWhen Vanar chieftains stood around.  \nAnd can a king like me forsake  \nHis friend, and plighted promise break?  \nReflect, O Vanar, on the cause,  \nThe sanction of eternal laws,  \nAnd, justly smitten down, confess  \nThou diest for thy wickediness,  \nBy honour was I bound to lend  \nAssistance to a faithful friend;  \nAnd thou hast met a righteous fate  \nThy former sins to expiate.  \nAnd thus wilt thou some merit win  \nAnd make atonement for thy sin.  \nFor hear me, Vanar King, rehearse  \nWhat Manu 1 spake in ancient verse,--  \nThis holy law, which all accept  \nWho honour duty, have I kept:  \n\'Pure grow the sinners kings chastise,  \nAnd, like.the virtuous, gain the skies;  \nBy pain or full atonement freed,  \nThey reap the fruit of righteous deed,  \nWhile kings who punish not incur  \nThe penalties of those who err.\'  \nMandhata 2 once, a noble king,  \nLight of the line from which I spring,  \nPunished with death a devotee  \nWhen he had stooped to sin like thee;  \nAnd many a king in ancient time  \nHas punished frantic sinners\' crime,  \nAnd, when their impious blood was spilt,  \nHas washed away the stain of guilt.  \nCease, Bali, cease; no more complain:  \nReproaches and laments are vain.  \nFor thou art justly punished: we  \nObey our king and are not free.  \nOnce more, O Bali, lend thine ear  \n\nAnother weightiest plea to hear.  \nFor this, when heard and pondered well.  \nWill all complaint and rage dispel.  \nMy soul will ne\'er this deed repent,  \nNor was my shaft in anger sent.  \nWe take the silvan tribes beset  \nWith snare and trap and gin and net,  \nAnd many a heedless deer we smite  \nFrom thickest shade, concealed from sight.  \nWild for the slaughter of the game,  \nAt stately stags our shafts we aim.  \nWe strike them bounding scared away,  \nWe strike them as they stand at bay,  \nWhen careless in the shade they lie,  \nOr scan the plain with watchful eye.  \nThey turn away their heads; we aim,  \nAnd none the eager hunter blame.  \nEach royal saint, well trained in law  \nOf duty, loves his bow to draw  \nAnd strike the quarry, e\'en as thou  \nHast fallen by mine arrow now,  \nFiphting with him or unaware,--  \nA Vanar thou.--I little care. 1b  \nBut yet, O best of Vanars, know  \nThat kings who rule the earth bestow  \nFruit of pure life and virtuous deed.  \nAnd lofty duty\'s hard-won meed.  \nHarm not thy lord the king: abstain  \nFrom ant and word that cause him pain;  \nFor kings are children of the skies  \nWho walk this earth in men\'s disguise.  \nBut thou, in duty\'s claims untaught,  \nthy breast with blinding passion fraught,  \nAssailest me who still have clung  \nTo duty, with thy bitter tongue.\'  \n   He ceased; and Ball sore distressed  \nThe sovereign claims of law confessed,  \nAnd freed, o\'erwhelmed with woe and shame,  \nThe lord of Raghu\'s race from blame.  \nThen, reverent palm to palm applied,  \nTo Rama thus the Vanar cried:  \n\'True, best of men, is every word  \nThat from thy lips these ears have heard,  \nIt ill beseems a wretch like me  \nTo bandy empty words with thee.  \nForgive the angry taunts that broke  \nFrom my wild bosom as I spoke.  \nAnd lay not to my charge, O King,  \n\np. 348  \n\nMy mad reproaches\' idle sting.  \nThou, in the truth by trial trained,  \nBest knowledge of the right hast gained:  \nAnd layest, just and pure within,  \nThe meetest penalty on sin.  \nThrough every bond of law I burst,  \nThe boldest sinner and the worst.  \nO let thy right-instructing speech  \nConsole my heart and wisely teach.\'  \n   Like some sad elephant who stands  \nFast sinking in the treacherous sands,  \nThus Bali raised despairing eyes;  \nThen spake again with sobs and sighs:  \n   \'Not for myself, O King, I grieve,  \nFor Tara or the friends I leave,  \nAs for sweet Angad, my dear son,  \nMy noble, only little one.  \nFor, nursed in luxury and bliss,  \nHis father he will mourn and miss,  \nAnd like a stream whose fount is dry  \nWill waste away and sink and die,--  \nMy own dear child, my only boy,  \nHis mother Tara\'s hope and joy.  \nSpare him, O son of Raghu, spare  \nThe child entrusted to thy care.  \nMy Angad and Sugriva treat  \nE\'en as thy heart considers meet,  \nFor thou, O chief of men, art strong  \nTo guard the right and punish wrong.  \nO, if thou wilt thine ear incline  \nTo hear these dying words of mine,  \nHe and Sugriva will to thee  \nAs Bharat and as Lakshman be.  \nLet not my Tara, left forlorn,  \nWeep for Sugriva\'s wrathful scorn;  \nNor let him, for her lord\'s offence,  \nCondemn her faithful innocence.  \nAnd well and wisely may he reign  \nIf thy dear grace his power sustain:  \nIf, following thee his friend and guide,  \nHe turn not from thy hest aside:  \nThus may he reign with glory, nay  \nThus to the skies will win his way.  \nThough stayed by Tara\'s fond recall,  \nBy thy dear hand I longed to fall.  \nAgainst my brother rushed and fought,  \nAnd gained the death I long have sought.\'  \n   Then Rama thus the prince consoled  \nFrom whose clear eyes the mists were rolled:  \n\'Grieve not for those thou leavest thus,  \nNor tremble for thyself or us,  \nFor we will deal with thine and thee  \nAs duty and the laws decree.  \nHe who exacts and he who pays,  \nIs justly slain or justly slays,  \nShall in the life to come have bliss;  \nFor each has done his task in this.  \nThou, wandering from the right, art made  \nPure by the forfeit thou hast paid.  \nThy weight of sins is cast aside,  \nAnd duty\'s claim is satisfied.  \nThen grieve no more, O Prince, but clear  \nThy bosom from all doubt and fear,  \nFor fate, inexorably stern,  \nThou hast no power to move or turn.  \nThy princely Angad still will share  \nMy tender love. Sugriva\'s care;  \nAnd to thy offspring shall be shown  \nAffection that shall match thine own.\'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[346:1](ry291.htm#fr_595) Hayagriva, Horse-necked, is a form of Vishnu\n\n[346:2](ry291.htm#fr_596) "As\'vatara is the name of a chief of the Nagas or\nserpents which inhabit the regions under the earth; it is also the name of a\nGandharva. As\'vatari ought to be the wife of one of the two, but I am not sure\nthat this conjecture is right. The commentator does not say who this As\'vatari\nis, or what tradition or myth, is alluded to. Vimalabodha reads As\'vatari in\nthe nominative case, and explains, As\'vatari is the sun, and as the sun with\nhis rays brings back the moon which has been sunk in the ocean and the\ninfernal regions, so will I bring back Sita."

"But men who have committed\noffences and have received from kings the punishment due to them, go pure to\nheaven and become as clear as those who have done well."\n\n[347:2](ry292.htm#fr_599) Mandhata was one of the earlier descendants of\nIkshvaku. His name is mentioned in Rama\'s genealogy, p. 81.\n\n[347:1b](ry292.htm#fr_600) I cannot understand how Valmiki could put such an\nexcuse as this into Rama\'s mouth. Rama with all solemn ceremony, has made a\nleague of alliance with Bali\'s younger brother whom he regards as a dear\nfriend and almost as an equal, and now he winds up his reasons for killing\nBali by coolly saying: \'Besides you are only a monkey, you know, after all,\nand as such I have every right to kill you how, when, and where I like.\'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XIX.: Tara\'s Grief.](ry293.htm)\n\n'
