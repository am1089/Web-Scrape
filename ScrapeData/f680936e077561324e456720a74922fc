The sun is indeed the honey 2 of the Devas. The heaven is the cross-beam\n(from which) the sky (hangs as) a hive, and the bright vapours are the eggs of\nthe bees 3.\n\n2\\. The eastern rays of the sun are the honey-cells in front. The _Ri_ _k_\nverses are the bees, the Rig-veda (sacrifice) is the flower, the water (of the\nsacrificial libations) is the nectar (of the flower).\n\n3\\. Those very _Ri_ _k_ verses then (as bees) brooded over the Rig-veda\nsacrifice (the flower); and from it, thus brooded on, sprang as its (nectar)\nessence, fame, glory of countenance, vigour, strength, and health 4.\n\n4\\. That (essence) flowed forth and went towards the sun 5. And that forms\nwhat we call the red (rohita) light of the rising sun.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[38:1](sbe01059.htm#fr_159) After the various meditations on the Sama-veda\nsacrifice, the sun is next to be meditated on, as essential to the performance\nof all sacrifices.\n\n[38:2](sbe01059.htm#fr_160) Everybody delights in the sun, as the highest\nreward of all sacrifices.\n\n[38:3](sbe01059.htm#fr_161) I am not certain whether this passage is rightly\ntranslated. Rajendralal Mitra speaks of an arched bamboo, whence the\natmosphere hangs pendant like a hive, in which the vapours are the eggs. Apupa\nmeans a cake, and may mean a hive. In order to understand the simile, we ought\nto have a clearer idea of the construction of the ancient bee-hive.\n\n[38:4](sbe01059.htm#fr_162) Annadya, explained as food, but more likely\nmeaning power to eat, appetite, health. See III, 13, 1.\n\n[38:5](sbe01059.htm#fr_163) The commentator explains: The _Ri_ _k_ verses, on\nbecoming part of the ceremonial, perform the sacrifice. The sacrifice (the\nflower), when surrounded by the _Ri_ _k_ verses (bees), yields its essence,\nthe nectar. That essence consists in all the rewards to be obtained through\nsacrifice, and as these rewards are to be enjoyed in the p. 39 next world and\nin the sun, therefore that essence or nectar is said to ascend to the sun.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2](sbe01060.htm)\n\n'
