Suta said :-- \xc2\x93O Ri _s_ is! On that very day when the Brahmi _n_ Kas'yapa\nwent out of his house, Tak _s_ ak, knowing the king Parik _s_ it cursed,\nassumed an aged Brahmi _n_ 's form and went out of his abode.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe serpent Tak _s_ ak met the Brahmi _n_ Kas'yapa on the way. Seeing the\nBrahma _n_ a, versed in the Mantras, Tak _s_ ak asked him \xc2\x93Where are you going\nso in haste, and what for are you taking this trouble?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n4-17. Thus questioned, Kas'yapa replied :-- I heard that the serpent Tak _s_\nak will bite the king Parik _s_ it; therefore I am going in haste to the king\nParik _s_ it to cure him of the serpent's poison. I know the mantra (mystic\nverse) that can destroy the effect of poison. If his life-period is not\nexhausted, I will certainly give him back his life. Tak _s_ ak then. Said :--\n\xc2\x93O Brahma _n_ a! I am that Tak _s_ ak; I will bite him and take away his life.\nSo you better desist. Will you be able to treat him whom I bite; certainly you\nwill not.\xc2\x94 Kas'yapa said :-- \xc2\x93O chief of snakes! When you will bite the king\nwho has been cursed by the Brahma _n_ , I will no doubt make him alive by the\npower of my mantra.\xc2\x94 Tak _s_ ak said :-- \xc2\x93O chief of Brahma _n_ as! If you\nhave so thought that you will make the king alive after I bite him, then shew\nme your strength before hand. O sinless one! I will bite this Nyagrodha tree\n(the Indian fig-tree); just now make it alive.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nKas'yapa said :-- \xc2\x93Certainly I will make this tree alive, that will be burnt\naway by the venom of your teeth.\xc2\x94 Suta said :-- \xc2\x93The snake Tak _s_ ak then bit\nthe tree, which was reduced to ashes; and asked Kas'yapa to bring back that\ntree to life.\xc2\x94 Seeing the tree reduced to ashes by the fire of venom of the\nsnake, he collected all the ashes and said :-- \xc2\x93O highly venomous serpent. See\nto-day the power of my mantra. Behold! While you are witnessing, I will\nenliven this tree. Thus the great mantra-knower Kas'yapa took water in his\nhand, and impregnating it with his mantra power, sprinkled the water on the\nashes. Immediately, on the sprinkling of the mantra saturated water, the\nNyagrodha tree got back its life as before. Tak _s_ ak became greatly\nastonished to see the tree enlivened again and said to Kas'yapa :-- \xc2\x93O chief\nof Brahma _n_ s! What is your object in taking so much pains? Speak out what\nyou want and I will fulfil your desires.\xc2\x94 Kas'yapa said :-- \xc2\x93O chief of\nserpents! Knowing the king cursed, I am going to do good to him by my __\nknowledge and to get in return abundant wealth.\xc2\x94 Hearing this, Tak _s_ ak said\n:-- \xc2\x93I will give you the amount of wealth that you desire; take that and go\nback to your house, and let my desire be also fulfilled.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n18-26. Kas'yapa, the knower of the highest state, heard Tak _s_ aka's words\nand pondered in his mind again and again. \xc2\x93What is to be done now? If I take\nthis wealth and go back to my house, my name and fame will not be known in\nthis world, simply for my greed; but if the king be made alive again, my\nundying fame, abundant wealth, and greater\n\n\n\np. 109\n\n\n\nPu _n_ yam will accrue to me. Again fie to that wealth with which there is no\nfame; so one must try one's best to preserve one's fame. The king Raghu, in\nancient days, gave away everything of his to the Brahma _n_ as for fame; the\nking Hari _s_ chandra and Kar _n_ a did not hesitate a bit to give away\nendless property. There is one point again to take into account, how can I\ntrifle away the matter, seeing the king burnt up by the venomous fire?\n\n\n\nIf I can bring back the king's life, everyone will become happy. If the\nkingdom be without its king, the subjects will, no doubt, be ruined. So,\nfollowing the king's death, sin will also incur on me due to the ruin of the\nsubjects; and infamy will come on my head that I am a very greedy man.\xc2\x94 Thus\nmeditating in his mind, the highly intelligent Kas'yapa began to meditate, and\nplunged himself in Dhyan; he thereby came to know that the king's life period\nwas spent up. Thus knowing the king's death imminent, the virtuous Kas'yapa\ntook the desired wealth from Tak _s_ ak and returned home.\n\n\n\n27-48. Thus making Kas'yapa to retire to his house on the seventh day Tak _s_\nak went on to Hastinapur to bring death and destruction on to Pariksit. When\nhe went close to the city, he heard that the king Pariksit was staying on the\nupper story of the palace; and the palace had been preserved by various gems,\nmantras, herbs and plant. Tak _s_ ak became very anxious; and fearing, lest\nthe curse of the Brahma _n_ as, will fall on his head, became very much\nagitated and thought. \xc2\x93How shall I now enter the palace? How can I cheat this\nstupid hypocrite vicious king, cursed by the Brahma _n_ a, who causes troubles\nto the Brahma _n_ as. Not a single man has taken birth in the Pa _nd_ ava\nfamily ever since that he coiled a dead serpent round the neck of an ascetic\nBrahmi _n_. The king has committed a very heinous crime and knowing the course\nof time to be in fallible, has placed sentries on all sides of the palace and\nhas ascended to the top-most story of the building, thinking thereby to\ndeceive Death and is staying in a peaceful mind. How can then he be smitten,\nin accordance with the Brahma _n_ a's word? The king, of dull intellect, knows\nnot that death cannot be prevented; for that reason he has placed guards and\nsentinels round the building, and himself has got up the house and is happily\nwhiling away his time; but he is quite ignorant that when Fate who can never\nbe violated, ordains the death, how can it be prevented though thousands of\nattempts are made to thwart it? This scion of Pa _n_ du family knows that his\ndeath is at hand and yet wants to live and therefore is staying in his own\nplace with a tranquil mind. The king ought now to make charities and other\nmeritorious works; it is only by acts of Dharma that disease is destroyed and\nlife is prolonged.\n\n\n\np. 110\n\n\n\nAnd if that be not the object then a dying man ought to take bath, to make\ncharities and to await his time of death; he thereby attains heaven; otherwise\nhell is inevitable. The king committed great sin in the act of causing pains\nand trouble to the Brahmi _n_ or other similar acts and therefore death is so\nclose that the Brahmi _n_ curse has fallen thus on his head. Is there no such\nBrahmi _n_ who can make him understand this; or the Creator has ordained his\ndeath now as inevitable.\xc2\x94 Thus meditating, the chief serpent made other\nserpents following him assume then form of ascetic Brahma _n_ as and gave them\nroots and fruits to be taken to the king. The serpent Tak _s_ ak himself\nentered within the fruits in the form of an insect. Then the ascetic serpents\ntook the fruits and quickly went out of the place. They came to the palace\nwhere Pariksit was resting. Seeing them, the guards asked :-- \xc2\x93What for have\nyou come here?\xc2\x94 Hearing this, \xc2\x93We are coming from the hermitage to prolong the\nlife of the hero king, the son of Abhimanyu and the son of the Pa _nd_ ava\nfamily, by chanting the mantras of the Atharvavedas, and we want to have an\ninterview with the king; now you better go and inform the king that some Munis\nhave come to see you. We will sprinkle water on him and give him some sweet\nfruits and then depart. We have never come across such gatekeepers in the\nfamily of Bharat as disallow the ascetic Muni visitors to go and see the king.\nWe will ascend to the place where the Pariksit is staying and we will bless\nhim, and wish him long life; we will communicate to him our orders and then\ndepart to our own places.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n49-68. Suta said :-- Hearing these words, the sentinels spoke as previously\nordered by the king, as follows :-- \xc2\x93O Brahma _n_ as! We think verily you\nwon't be able to have an interview with the king to-day; you, all ascetics can\ncome to-morrow to this palace. O Munis! Owing to the Brahma _n_ a's curse, the\nking has built this place; then it follows, as a matter of course, that the\nBrahma _n_ as are not allowed to get up to the palace.\xc2\x94 Then the serpents, in\nthe form of the Brahma _n_ as, spoke :-- \xc2\x93O good sentinels! Then take these\nroots and fruits and offer them to the king and communicate to him our\nblessings.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nThe sentinels went to the king, and informed him of the arrival of the ascetic\nBrahma _n_ as. The king replied :-- \xc2\x93Bring here the roots and fruits offered\nby them and ask what for they have come. Give them my pranams; to-day I cannot\nmeet with them; let them come to-morrow morning.\xc2\x94 The sentinels went to the\nascetics and got from them their roots and fruits and offered them with great\nrespect to the king. When the serpents in the guise of the hypocrite Brahmi\n_n_ s went away, the king took those fruits and spoke to his ministers :--\n\n\n\np. 111\n\n\n\n\xc2\x93Take __ these fruits and let all my friends eat them. I will take only this\none __ fruit given by the Brahma _n_ as and will eat it.\xc2\x94 Saying this, the\nUttara's son Pariksit gave away fruits to the friends and took one ripe fruit\nfor himself, broke it and saw within it a very fine copper-coloured black eyed\ninsect. At this the ministers were astonished; the King spoke to them :-- \xc2\x93The\nsun has set; so there is no further chance of any fear from any poison to-day.\nI speak then to-day, fearing the Brahma _n_ 's curse, let this insect bite\nme.\xc2\x94 Thus saying the king took that insect and placed it on his neck. That Tak\n_s_ ak in the form of an insect, when placed, during the sun-set, on the neck\nby the king, immediately assumed the form of the terrible Kala (Death), coiled\nround the king and beat him. The Ministers were greatly surprised and began to\nweep and cry with great pain and sorrow. Seeing that terrible serpent, the\nministers, overwhelmed with terror, fled away on all sides. The guards cried\nout loudly. The terrible out-cry was raised on all sides. Then Uttara's son,\nthe king Pariksit, coiled by the serpent, saw that all his efforts were\nrendered fruitless, and remained silent and held fast to his patience. From\nthe mouth of the serpent Tak _s_ ak the terrible venomous flames came out\nburning all and immediately killed the king. Thus taking away the life of the\nking, Tak _s_ ak went up in the celestial atmosphere; the people then saw that\nthe serpent was ready as if to burn the world. The king fell down lifeless\nlike a burnt tree; and all the persons cried out seeing the king dead.\n\n\n\nThus ends the tenth Chapter of the Second Skandha on the death of the king\nPariksit in the Mahapura _n_ am S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 11](bk02ch11.htm)\n\n"
