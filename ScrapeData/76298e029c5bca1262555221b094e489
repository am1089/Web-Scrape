But (Brahman's creative activity) is mere sport, such as we see in\nordinary life.\n\nThe word 'but' discards the objection raised.--We see in every-day life that\ncertain doings of princes or other men of high position who have no\nunfulfilled desires left have no\n\np. 457\n\nreference to any extraneous purpose; but proceed from mere sportfulness, as,\nfor instance, their recreations in places of amusement. We further see that\nthe process of inhalation and exhalation is going on without reference to any\nextraneous purpose, merely following the law of its own nature. Analogously,\nthe activity of the Lord also may be supposed to be mere sport, proceeding\nfrom his own nature 1, without reference to any purpose. For on the ground\nneither of reason nor of Scripture can we construe any other purpose of the\nLord. Nor can his nature be questioned 2\\--Although the creation of this world\nappears to us a weighty and difficult undertaking, it is mere play to the\nLord, whose power is unlimited. And if in ordinary life we might possibly, by\nclose scrutiny, detect some subtle motive, even for sportful action, we cannot\ndo so with regard to the actions of the Lord, all whose wishes are fulfilled,\nas Scripture says.--Nor can it be said that he either does not act or acts\nlike a senseless person; for Scripture affirms the fact of the creation on the\none hand, and the Lord's omniscience on the other hand. And, finally, we must\nremember that the scriptural doctrine of creation does not refer to the\nhighest reality; it refers to the apparent world only, which is characterised\nby name and form, the figments of Nescience, and it, moreover, aims at\nintimating that Brahman is the Self of everything.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[457:1](sbe34172.htm#fr_314) The nature (svabhava) of the Lord is, the\ncommentators say, Maya joined with time and karman.\n\n[457:2](sbe34172.htm#fr_315) This clause is an answer to the objection that\nthe Lord might remain at rest instead of creating a world useless to himself\nand the cause of pain to others. For in consequence of his conjunction with\nMaya the creation is unavoidable. Go. \xc3\x82n. Avidya naturally tends towards\neffects, without any purpose. Bha.\n\n\xc3\x82n.
