Should it be said, on account of absence of mention in the first (reply);\nwe say no, for just that (is meant), on the ground of fitness.\n\nAn objection is raised to the conclusion arrived at under III, 1, 1; on the\nground that in the first oblation, described in _Kh_. Up. V, 4, 2, as being\nmade into the heavenly world, water is not mentioned at all as the thing\noffered. The text says, 'on that altar the gods offer _s_ raddha'; and by _s_\nraddha (belief) everybody understands a certain activity of mind. Water\ntherefore is not the thing offered.--Not so, we reply. It is nothing else but\nwater, which there is called _s_ raddha. For thus only question and answer\nhave a sense. For the question is, 'Do you know why in the fifth libation\nwater is called man?' and at the outset of the reply _s_ raddha is mentioned\nas constituting the oblation made into the heavenly world viewed as a fire. If\nhere the word _s_ raddha did not denote water, question and answer would refer\nto different topics, and there would be no connexion. The form in which the\nfinal statement is introduced (iti tu pa _\xc3\xb1 k_amyam, &c., 'but thus in the\nfifth oblation,' &c.), moreover, also intimates that _s_ raddha means water.\nThe word 'iti,' _thus_ , here intimates that the answer is meant to dispose of\nthe question, 'Do you know _how_?' &c. _S_ raddha becomes moon, rain, food,\nseed, embryo in succession, and _thus_ the water comes to be called man.\nMoreover, the word _s_ raddha is actually used in the Veda in the sense of\n'water'; 'he carries water, _s_ raddha indeed is water' (Taitt. Sa _m_ h. I,\n6, 8, 1). Aad what the text says as\n\np. 588\n\nto king Soma (the moon) originating from _s_ raddha when offered, also shows\nthat _s_ raddha must mean water.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 6.
