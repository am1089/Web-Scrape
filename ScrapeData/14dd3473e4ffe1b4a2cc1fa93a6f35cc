Now, when the head of the sacrifice (victim) was struck off, its\nsap, running, entered the waters. It is by that very sap that those waters\nflow; that very sap is believed to be flowing there 1.\n\n3:9:2:22\\. And when he goes for the Vasativari water, he fetches that same sap\nand puts it into the sacrifice, and makes the sacrifice sapful; this is why he\ngoes for the Vasativari water.\n\n3:9:2:33\\. He distributes it over all the Savanas (Soma-pressings) 2; thereby\nhe imbues all the pressings\n\np. 223\n\nwith that sap, makes all the pressings sapful: this is why he distributes it\nover all the pressings.\n\n3:9:2:44\\. Let him take it from flowing (water); for that sap of the sacrifice\nwas moving 1: let him therefore take it from flowing (water).\n\n3:9:2:55\\. Moreover, it is taken for the purpose of protection. Now,\neverything else here on earth, whatever it be, takes rest, even yonder blowing\n(wind); but these (waters) alone take no rest: therefore let him take it from\nflowing (water).\n\n3:9:2:66\\. Let him take it by day, thinking, 'Seeing, I will take the sap of\nthe sacrifice 2:' therefore let him take it by day. For it is for him that\nburns yonder (the sun) that he takes it, since he takes it for all the gods,\nand all the gods are his rays of light: therefore let him take it by day. For\nit is by day alone that he (shines): therefore, then, let him take it by day.\n\n3:9:2:77\\. And again, all the gods, forsooth, now come to the sacrificer's\nhouse; and if one takes the Vasativari water before the setting of the sun, it\nis as when one's better comes to visit one, he would honour him by trimming\nhis house. They draw nigh to that sacrificial food, and abide (upa-vas) in\nthat Vasativari 3 water,--that is the Upavasatha (preparation-day).\n\n3:9:2:88\\. And if the sun were to set on any one's (Vasativaris) not having\nbeen taken, then expiation is made. If he have performed a (Soma-)sacrifice\nbefore this, let him (the Adhvaryu) take it from his tank 4, since\n\np. 224\n\nthat (water) of his has been taken before (sunset) by day. But should he not\nhave offered before, if there be one who has offered (Soma) settled close by\nor somewhere thereabout 1, let him take it from his tank, since that (water)\nof his has been taken before, by day.\n\n3:9:2:99\\. But if he cannot obtain either kind (of water), let him seize a\nfirebrand and betake himself (to the flowing water), and let him take thereof\nwhile holding that (firebrand) close above it; or let him take it while\nholding a piece of gold close above it: thus it is made like yonder burning\n(sun).\n\n3:9:2:1010\\. He takes therefrom with the text (V4;. S. VI, 23), 'Rich in havis\nare these waters,'--for the sap of the sacrifice entered into them, wherefore\nhe says, 'Rich in havis (sacrificial food) are these waters;'--'One rich in\nhavis wooeth for (them),' for the sacrificer, rich in havis, woos for (wishes\nto obtain) them; wherefore he says, 'One rich in havis wooeth for (them).'\n\n3:9:2:1111\\. 'Rich in havis (may be) the divine cult;' cult, namely, means the\nsacrifice; thus he makes the sacrifice for which he takes it rich in\nsacrificial food, therefore he says, 'Rich in havis is the divine cult.'\n\n3:9:2:1212\\. 'May Surya be rich in havis!' For he takes it for yonder burning\n(sun), since he takes it for all the gods, and all the gods are his (the\nsun's) rays of light; therefore he says, 'May Surya (the sun) be rich in\nhavis!'\n\n3:9:2:1313\\. Having fetched it, he deposits it behind the Garhapatya 2, with\n(Va _g_. S. VI, 24), 'I seat you in\n\np. 225\n\nthe seat of Agni, the safe-housed;' whereby he means to say, 'I seat you\n(waters) in the seat of Agni, whose house is unimpaired.' And when the animal\noffering to Agni and Soma comes to a close, then he carries (the Vasativari\nwater) round. He says (thrice), 'Disperse!' The sacrificer is seated in front\nof the Soma-carts (holding Soma on his lap 1). He (the Adhvaryu) takes it (the\nwater standing behind the Garhapatya).\n\n3:9:2:1414\\. He walks out (of the hall) by the south (door), and puts it down\non the south hip (of the high altar), with, 'Ye (waters) are Indra and Agni's\nshare!' for he takes it for all the gods, and Indra and Agni are all the gods.\nHe takes it up again and puts it down in front of the lady (who, seated behind\nthe Garhapatya, touches the water-jar). Walking round behind the lady he\n(again) takes it.\n\n3:9:2:1515\\. He walks out (of the hall by the east door), along the north side\n(of the altar), and puts down (the water) on the north hip (of the high\naltar), with, 'Ye are Mitra and Varu _n_ a's share!' Let him not put it down\nin this way 2 that is redundant, and no fitting conclusion is thus attained.\nLet him rather (here also) say, 'Ye are Indra and Agni's share!' only thus\nthere is nothing redundant, and so a fitting conclusion is obtained.\n\n3:9:2:1616\\. That (Vasativari water) is carried round for the sake of\nprotection; Agni is in front (of the sacrificial ground), and now that (water)\nmoves about all round, repelling the evil spirits. He puts it\n\np. 226\n\ndown in the \xc3\x82gnidhra (fire-house) with, 'Ye are all the gods' share!' whereby\nhe makes all the gods enter it. It is a desirable object (vara) to the\ndwellers (vasat), hence the name Vasativari 1, and verily he who knows this,\nbecomes a desirable object to the dwellers.\n\n3:9:2:1717\\. Now there are here seven formulas; with four he takes (the\nwater), with one he puts it down behind the Garhapatya, with one he carries it\nround, with one (he puts it down) in the \xc3\x82gnidhra,--this makes seven. For when\nthe metres were produced from Va _k_ (speech), the one consisting of seven\nfeet, the _S_ akvari, was the last (highest) of them;--that completeness (he\nbrings about): hence there are seven formulas.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[222:1](sbe2637.htm#fr_556) Yatra vai ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ asya _s_ iro ' _kh_ _h_\nidyata tasya raso drutvapa _h_ pravi _s_ at sa esha rasa eti ya eta apa _h_\nsyandante tenaivaina etad rasena syandamana manyante ya _h_ sa ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ asya\nrasas tam evaitad rasa _m_ syandamanam manyante, Ka _n_ va rec.\n\n[222:2](sbe2637.htm#fr_557) 'He divides it into three parts for all the\npressings,' Ka _n_ va text.
