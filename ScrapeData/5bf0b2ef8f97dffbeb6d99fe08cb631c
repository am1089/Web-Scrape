The description of\nRama\'s princely virtues and the rejoicings at his proposed coronation, with\nwhich the Book begins, contrast with much dramatic force and effect with the\ndark intrigues which follow, and which end in his cruel banishment for\nfourteen years.\n\nThe portions translated in this Book form Sections i., ii., vi., and vii.,\nportions of Sections x. to xiii., and the whole of Section xviii. of Book ii\nof the original text.\n\n## I\n\n## THE COUNCIL CONVENED\n\nThus the young and brave Satrughna, Bharat ever true and bold,  \nWent to warlike western regions where Kaikeyas lived of old,\n\nWhere the ancient Aswa-pati ruled his kingdom broad and fair,  \nHailed the sons of Dasa-ratha with a grandsire\'s loving care.\n\nTended with a fond affection, guarded with a gentle sway,  \nStillthe princes of their father dreamt and thought by night and day,\n\nAnd their father in Ayodhya, great of heart and stout of hand,  \nThought of Bharat and Satrughna living in Kaikeya\'s land.\n\nFor his great and gallant princes were to him his life and light,  \nWere a part of Dasa-ratha like his hands and arms of might,\n\nBut of all his righteous children righteous Rama won his heart,  \nAs SWAYABIBHU of all creatures, was his dearest, holiest part,\n\nFor his Rama strong and stately was his eldest and his best,  \nVoid of every baser passion and with every virtue blest!\n\nSoft in speech, sedate and peaceful, seeking still the holy path,  \nCalm in conscious worth and valour, taunt nor cavil waked his wrath,\n\nIn the field of war excelling, boldest warrior midst the bold,  \nIn the palace chambers musing on the tales by elders told,\n\nFaithful to the wise and learned, truthful in his deed and word,  \nRama dearly loved his people and his people loved their lord!\n\nTo the Brahmans pure and holy Rama due obeisance made,  \nTo the poor and to the helpless deeper love and honour paid,\n\nSpirit of his race and nation was to high-souled Rama given,  \nThoughtsthat widen human glory, deeds that ope the gates of heaven\n\nNot intent on idle cavil Rama spake with purpose high,  \nAnd the God of speech might envy when he spake or made reply,\n\nIn the learning of the _Vedas_ highest meed and glory won,  \nIn the skill of arms the father scarcely matched the gallant son!\n\nTaught by sages and by elders in the manners of his race,  \nRama, grew in social virtues and each soft endearing grace,\n\nTaught by inborn pride and wisdom patient purpose to conceal,  \nDeep determined was his effort, dauntless was his silent will!\n\nPeerless in his skill and valour steed and elephant to tame,  \nDauntless leader of his forces, matchless in his warlike fame,\n\nHigher thought and nobler duty did the righteous Rama move,  \nBy his toil and by his virtues still he sought his people\'s love\n\nDasa-ratha marked his Rama with each kingly virtue blest,  \nAnd from lifelong royal duties now he sought repose and rest:\n\n"Shall I see my son anointed, seated on Kosala\'s throne,  \nIn the evening of my lifetime ere my days on earth be done,\n\nShall I place my ancient empire in the youthful Rama\'s care,  \nSeek for me a higher duty and prepare for life more fair?"\n\nPondering thus within his bosom counsel from his courtiers sought,  \nAnd to crown his Rama, Regent, was his purpose and his thought,\n\nFor strange signs and diverse tokens now appeared on earth and sky,  \nAnd his failing strength and vigour spoke his end approaching nigh,\n\nAnd he witnessed Rama\'s virtues filling all the world with love,  \nAs the full-moon\'s radiant lustre fills the earth from skies above!\n\nDear to him appeared his purpose, Rama to his people dear,  \nPrivate wish and public duty made his path serene and clear,\n\nDasa-ratha called his Council, summoned chiefs from town and plain.  \nWelcomed too from distant regions monarchs and the kings of men,\n\nMansions meet for prince andchieftain to his guests the monarch gave,  \nGracious as the Lord of Creatures held the gathering rich and brave!\n\nNathless to Kosala\'s Council nor Videha\'s monarch came,  \nNor the warlike chief Kaikeya, Aswa-pati king of fame,\n\nTo those kings and near relations, ancient Dasa-ratha meant,  \nMessage of the proud anointment with his greetings would be sent.\n\nBrightly dawned the day of gathering; in the lofty Council Hall  \nStately chiefs and ancient burghers came and mustered one and all,\n\nAnd each prince and peer was seated on his cushion rich and high,  \nAnd on monarch Dasa-ratha eager turned his anxious eye,\n\nGirt by crowned kings and chieftains, burghers from the town and plain,  \nDasa-ratha shone like INDRA girt by heaven\'s immortal train!\n\n## II\n\n## THE PEOPLE CONSULTED\n\nWith the voice of pealing thunder Dasa-ratha spake to all,  \nTo the princes and the burghers gathered in Ayodhya\'s hall:\n\n"Known to all, the race of Raghu rules this empire broad and fair,  \nAnd hath ever loved and cherished subjects with a father\'s care,\n\nTn my fathers\' footsteps treading I have sought the ancient path,  \nNursed my people as my children, free from passion, pride and wrath,\n\nUnderneath this white umbrella, seated on this royal throne,  \nI have toiled to win their welfare and my task is almost done!\n\nYears have passed of fruitful labour, years of work by fortune blest,  \nAnd the evening of my lifetime needs, my friends, the evening\'s rest,\n\nYears have passed in watchful effort, Law and Duty to uphold,  \nEffort needing strength and prowess-and my feeble limbs are old!\n\nPeers and burghers, let your monarch, now his lifelong labour done,  \nFor the weal of lovinor subjects on his empire seat his son,\n\nINDRA-like in peerless valour, _rishi_ -like in holy lore,  \nRama follows Dasa-ratha, but in virtues stands before!\n\nThroned in Pushya\'s constellation shines the moon with fuller light  \nThroned to rule his father\'s empire Rama wins a loftier might,\n\nHe will be your gracious monarch favoured well by FORTUNE\'S QUEEN,  \nBy his virtue and his valour lord of earth he might have been!\n\nSpeak your thoughts and from this bosom lift a load of toil and care,  \nOn the proud throne of my fathers let me place a peerless heir,\n\nSpeak your thought, my chiefs and people, if this purpose please you well,  \nOr if wiser, better counsel in your wisdom ye can tell,\n\nSpeak your thoughts without compulsion, though this plan to me be dear,  \nIf some middle course were wiser, if some other way were clear!\n\nGathered chieftains hailed the mandate with applauses long and loud,  \nAs the peafowls hail the thunder of the dark and laden cloud,\n\nAnd the gathered subjects echoed loud and long the welcome sound,  \nTill the voices of the people shook the sky and solid ground!\n\nBrahmans versed in laws of duty, chieftains in their warlike pride,  \nCountless men from town and hamlet heard the mandate far and wide,\n\nAnd they met in consultation, joyously with one accord,  \nFreely and in measured accents, gave their answer to their lord:\n\n"Years of toil and watchful labour weigh upon thee, king of men,  \nYoung in years is righteous Rama, Heir and Regent let him reign,\n\nWe would see the princely Rama, Heir and Regent duly made,  \nRiding on the royal tusker in the white umbrella\'s shade!"\n\nSearching still their secret purpose, seeking still their thought to know,  \nSpake again the ancient monarch in his measured words and slow:\n\n"I would know your inner feelings, loyal thoughts and whispers kind,  \nFor a doubt within me lingers and a shadow clouds my mind,\n\nTrue to Law and true to Duty while I rule this kingdom fair,  \nWherefore would you see my Rama seated as the Regent Heir?"\n\n"We would see him Heir and Regent, Dasa-ratha, ancient lord,  \nFor his heart is blessed with valour, virtue marks his deed and word,\n\nLives not man in all the wide earth who excels the stainless youth,  \nIn his loyalty to Duty, in his love of righteous Truth,\n\nTruth impels his thought and action, Truth inspires his soul with grace,  \nAnd his virtue fills the wide earth and exalts his ancient race!\n\nBright Immortals know his valour; with his brother Lakshman hold  \nHe hath never failed to conquer hostile town or castled hold,\n\nAnd returning from his battles, from the duties of the war,  \nRiding on his royal tusker or his all-resistless car,\n\nAs a father to his children to his loving men he came,  \nBlessed our homes and maids and matrons till our infants lisped his name,\n\nFor our humble woes and troubles Rama hath the ready tear,  \nTo our humble tales of suffering Rama lends his willing ear!\n\nHappy is the royal father who hath such a righteous son,  \nFor in town and mart and hamlet every heart hath Rama won,\n\nBurghers and the toiling tillers tales of Rama\'s kindness say,  \nMan and infant, maid and matron, morn and eve for Rama pray,\n\nTo the Gods and bright Immortals we our inmost wishes send,  \nMay the good and godlike Rama on his father\'s throne ascend,\n\nGreat in gifts and great in glory, Rama doth our homage own,  \nWe would see the princely Rama seated on his father\'s throne!"\n\n## III\n\n## THE CITY DECORATED\n\nWith his consort pious Rama, pure in deed and pure in thought,  \nAfter evening\'s due ablutions NARAYANA\'S chamber sought,\n\nPrayed unto the Lord of Creatures, NARAYANA Ancient Sire,  \nPlaced his offering on his forehead, poured it on the lighted fire,\n\nPiously partook the remnant, sought for NARAYANA\'S aid,  \nAs he kept his fast and vigils on the grass of _kusa_ spread.\n\nWith her lord the saintly Sita silent passed the sacred night,  \nContemplating World\'s Preserver, Lord of Heaven\'s ethereal height,\n\nAnd within the sacred chamber on the grass of _kusa_ lay,  \nTill the crimson streaks of morning, ushered in the festive day,\n\nTill the royal bards and minstrels chanted forth the morning call,  \nHealing through the holy chamber, echoing through the roval hall.\n\nPast the night of sacred vigils, in his silken robes arrayed,  \nMessage of the proud anointment Rama to the Brahmans said,\n\nAnd the Brahmans spake to burghers that the festive day was come,  \nTill the mart and crowded pathway rang with note of pipe and drum,\n\nAnd the townsmen heard rejoicing of the vigils of the night,  \nKept by Rama and by Sita, for the day\'s auspicious rite.\n\nRama shall be Heir and Regent, Rama shall be crowned to-day,  \nRapid flew the gladdening message with the morning\'s gladsome ray,\n\nAnd the people of the city, maid and matron, man and boy,  \nDecorated fair Ayodhya in their wild tumultuous joy!\n\nOn the temple\'s lofty steeple high as cloud above the air,  \nOn the crossing of the pathways, in the garden green and fair,\n\nOn the merchant\'s ample warehouse, on the shop with stores displayed,  \nOn the mansion of the noble by the cunning artist made,\n\nOn the gay and bright pavilion, on the high and shady trees.  \nBanners rose and glittering streamers, flags that fluttered in the breeze!\n\nActors gay and nimble dancers, singers skilled in lightsome song,  \nWith their antics and their music pleased the gay and gathered throng,\n\nAnd the people met in conclaves, spake of Rama, Regent Heir,  \nAnd the children by the roadside lisped of Rama brave and fair!\n\nWomen wove the scented garland, merry maids the censer lit,  \nMen with broom and sprinkled water swept the spacious mart and street,\n\nRows of trees and posts they planted hung with lamps for coming night,  \nThat the midnight dark might rival splendour of the noonday light\n\nTroops of men and merry children laboured with a loving care,  \nWoman\'s skill and woman\'s fancy made the city passing fair,\n\nSo that good and kindly Rama might his people\'s toil approve,  \nSo that sweet and soft-eyed Sita might accept her people\'s love!\n\nGroups of joyous townsmen gathered in the square or lofty hall,  \nPraised the monarch Dasa-ratha, regent Rama young and tall:\n\n"Great and good is Dasa-ratha born of Raghu\'s royal race,  \nIn the fulness of his lifetime on his son he grants his grace,\n\nAnd we hail the rite auspicious for our prince of peerless might,  \nHe will guard us by his valotir, he will save our cherished right,\n\nDear unto his loving brothers in his father\'s palace hall,  \nAs is Rama to his brothers dear is Rama to us all,\n\nLong live ancient Dasa-ratha king of Raghu\'s royal race,  \nWe shall see his son anointed by his father\'s righteous grace!\n\nThus of Rama\'s consecration spake the burghers one and all,  \nAnd the men from distant hamlets poured within the city wall,\n\nFrom the confines of the empire, north and south and west and east,  \nCame to see the consecration and to share the royal feast!\n\nAnd the rolling tide of nations raised their voices loud and high,  \nLike the tide of sounding ocean when the full moon lights the sky,\n\nAnd Ayodhya thronged by people from the hamlet , mart and lea,  \nWas tumultuous like the ocean thronged by creatures of the sea!\n\n## IV\n\n## INTRIGUE\n\nIn the inner palace chamber stood the proud and peerless queen,  \nWith a mother\'s joy Kaikeyi gaily watched the festive scene,\n\nBut with deep and deadly hatred Manthara, her nurse and maid,  \nMarked the city bright with banners, and in scornful accents said:\n\n"Take thy presents back, Kaikeyi, for they ill befit the clay,  \nAnd when clouds of sorrow darken, ill beseems thee to be gay,\n\nAnd thy folly moves my laughter though an anguish wakes my sigh,  \nFor a gladness stirs thy bosom when thy greatest woo is nigh!\n\nWho that hath a woman\'s wisdom, who that is a prudent wife.  \nSmiles in joy when prouder rival triumphs in the race of life,\n\nHow can hapless Queen Kaikeyi greet this deed of darkness done,  \nWhen the favoured Queen Kausalya wins the empire for her son?\n\nKnow the truth, O witless woman! Bharat is unmatched in fame,  \nRama, deep and darkly jealous, dreads thy Bharat\'s rival claim,\n\nYounger Lakshman with devotion doth on eldest Rama wait,  \nYoung Satrughna with affection follows Bharat\'s lofty fate,\n\nRama dreads no rising danger from the twins, the youngest-born,  \nBut thy Bharat\'s claims and virtues fill his jealous heart with scorn!\n\nTrust me, queen, thy Bharat\'s merits are too well and widely known,  \nAnd he stands too near and closely by a rival brother\'s throne,\n\nRama hath a wolf-like wisdom and a fang to reach the foe,  \nAnd I tremble for thy Bharat, Heaven avert untimely woe!\n\nHappy is the Queen Kausalya, they will soon anoint her son,  \nWhen on Pushya\'s constellation gaily rides to-morrow\'s moon,\n\nHappy is the Queen Kausalya in her regal pomp and state,  \nAnd Kaikeyi like a bond-slave must upon her rival wait!\n\nWilt thou do her due obeisance as we humble women do,  \nWill thy proud and princely Bharat as his brother\'s henchman go,\n\nWill thy Bharat\'s gentle consort, fairest princess in this land,  \nIn her tears and in her anguish wait on Sita\'s proud command?\n\nWith a woman\'s scornful anger Manthara proclaimed her grief,  \nWith a mother\'s love for Rama thus Kaikeyi answered brief:\n\n"What inspires thee, wicked woman, thus to rail in bitter tone,  \nShall not Rama, best and eldest, fill his father\'s royal throne,\n\nWhat alarms thee, crooked woman, in the happy rites begun,  \nShall not Rama guard his brothers as a father guards his son?\n\nAnd when Rama\'s reign is over, shall not Gods my Bharat speed,  \nAnd by law and ancient custom shall not younger son succeed,\n\nIn the present bliss of Rama and in Bharat\'s future hope,  \nWhat offends thee, senseless woman, wherefore dost thou idly mope?\n\nDear is Rama as my Bharat, ever duteous in his ways,  \nRama honours Queen Kausalya, loftier honour to me pays,\n\nRama\'s realm is Bharat\'s kingdom, ruling partners they shall prove,  \nFor himself than for his brothers Rama owns no deeper love!"\n\nScorn and anger shook her person and her bosom heaved a sigh,  \nAs in wilder, fiercer accents Manthara thus made reply:\n\nWhat insensate rage or madness clouds thy heart and blinds thine eye,  \nCourting thus thy own disaster, courting danger dread and high,\n\nWhat dark folly clouds thy vision to the workings of thy foe,  \nHeedless thus to seek destruction and to sink in gulf of woe?\n\nKnow, fair queen, by law and custom, son ascends the throne of pride,  \nRama\'s son succeedeth Rama, luckless Bharat steps aside,\n\nBrothers do not share a kingdom, nor can one by one succeed,  \nMighty were the civil discord if such custom were decreed!\n\nFor to stop all war and tumult, thus the ancient laws ordain,  \nEldest son succeeds his father, younger children may not reign,\n\nBharat barred from Rama\'s empire, vainly decked with royal grace,  \nFriendless, joyless, long shall wander, alien from his land and race!\n\nThou hast home the princely Bharat, nursed him from thy gentle breast,  \nTo a queen and to a mother need a prince\'s claims be pressed,\n\nTo a thoughtless heedless mother must I Bharat\'s virtues plead,  \nMust the Queen Kaikeyi witness Queen Kausalya\'s son succeed?\n\nTrust thy old and faithful woman who bath nursed thee, youthful queen,  \nAnd in great and princely houses many darksome deeds hath seen,\n\nTrust my word, the wily Rama for his spacious empire\'s good,  \nSoon will banish friendless Bharat and secure his peace with blood!\n\nThou hast sent the righteous Bharat to thy ancient father\'s land,  \nAnd Satrughna young an valiant doth beside his brother stand,\n\nYoung in years and generous-hearted, they will grow in mutual love,  \nAs the love of elder Rama doth in Lakshman\'s bosom move,\n\nYoung companions grow in friendship, and our ancient legends tell,  \nWeeds protect a forest monarch which the woodman\'s axe would fell,\n\nCrowned Rama unto Lakshman will a loving brother prove,  \nBut for Bharat and Satrughna, Rama\'s bosom owns no love,\n\nAnd a danger thus ariseth if the elder wins the throne,  \nHaste thee, heedless Queen Kaikeyi, save the younger and thy son!\n\nSpeak thy mandate to thy husband, let thy Bharat rule at home,  \nIn the deep and pathless jungle let the banished Rama roam,\n\nThis will please thy ancient father and thy father\'s kith and kin,  \nThis will please the righteous people, Bharat knows no guile or sin!\n\nSpeak thy mandate to thy husband, win thy son a happy fate,  \nDoom him not to Rama\'s service or his unrelenting hate,\n\nLet not Rama in his rancour shed a younger brother\'s blood,  \nAs the lion slays the tiger in the deep and echoing wood!\n\nWith the magic of thy beauty thou hast won thy monarch\'s heart,  \nQueen Kausalya\'s bosom rankles with a woman\'s secret smart,\n\nLet her not with woman\'s vengeance turn upon her prouder foe,  \nAnd as crowned Rama\'s mother venge her in Kaikeyi\'s woe,\n\nMark my word, my child Kaikeyi, much these ancient eyes have seen,  \nRama\'s rule is death to Bharat, insult to my honoured queen!"\n\nLike a slow but deadly poison worked the ancient nurse\'s tears,  \nAnd a wife\'s undying impulse mingled with a mother\'s fears,\n\nDeep within Kaikeyi\'s bosom worked a woman\'s jealous thought,  \nSpeechless in her scorn and anger mourner\'s dark retreat she sought.\n\n## V\n\n## THE QUEEN\'S DEMAND\n\nRama shall be crowned at sunrise, so did royal bards proclaim,  \nEvery rite arranged and ordered, Dasa-ratha homeward came,\n\nTo the fairest of his consorts, dearest to his ancient heart,  \nCame the king with eager gladness joyful message to impart,\n\nRadiant as the Lord of Midnight, ere the eclipse casts its gloom,  \nCarne the old and ardent monarch heedless of his darksome doom!\n\nThrough the shady palace garden where the peacock wandered free.  \nLute and lyre poured forth their music, parrot flew from tree to tree,\n\nThrough the corridor of creepers, painted rooms by artists done,  \nAnd the halls where scented _Champak_ and the flaming _Asok_ shone,\n\nThrough the portico of splendour graced by silver, tusk and gold.  \nRadiant with his thought of gladness walked the monarch proud and bold.\n\nThrough the lines of scented blossoms which by limpid waters shone,  \nAnd the rooms with seats of silver, ivory bench and golden throne.\n\nThrough the chamber of confection, where each viand wooed the taste,  \nEvery object in profusion as in regions of the blest,\n\nThrough Kaikeyi\'s inner closet lighted with a softened sheen,  \nWalked the king with eager longing,--but Kaikeyi was not seen!\n\nThoughts of love and gentle dalliance woke-within his ancient heart,  \nAnd the magic of her beauty and the glamour of her art,\n\nWith a soft desire the monarch vainly searched the vanished fair,  \nFound her not in royal chamber, found her not in gay parterre!\n\nFilled with love and longing languor loitered not the radiant queen,  \nIn her soft voluptuous chamber, in the garden, grove or green,\n\nAnd he asked the faithful warder of Kaikeyi loved and lost,  \nShe who served him with devotion and his wishes never crost,\n\nSpake the warder in his terror that the queen with rage distraught.  \nWeeping silent tears of anguish had the mourner\'s chamber sought!\n\nThither flew the stricken monarch; on the bare and unswept ground,  \nTrembling with tumultuous passion was the Queen Kaikeyi found,\n\nOn the cold uncovered pavement sorrowing lay the weeping wife,  \nYoung wife of an ancient husband, dearer than his heart and life!\n\nLike a bright and blossoming creeper rudely severed from the earth,  \nLike a fallen fair Apsara, beauteous nymph of heavenly birth,\n\nLike a female forest-ranger bleeding from the hunter\'s dart,  \nWhom her mate the forest-monarch soothes with soft endearing art,\n\nLay the queen in tears of anguish! And with sweet and gentle word  \nTo the lotus-eyed lady softly spake her loving lord:\n\nWherefore thus, my Queen and Empress, sorrow-laden is thy heart,  \nWho with daring slight or insult seeks to cause thy bosom smart?\n\nIf some unknown ailment pains thee, evil spirit of the air,  \nSkilled physicians wait upon thee, priests with incantations fair,\n\nIf from human foe some insult, wipe thy tears and doom his fate,  \nRich reward or royal vengeance shall upon thy mandate wait!\n\nWilt thou doom to death the guiltless, free whom direst sins debase,  \nWilt thou lift the poor and lowly or the proud and great disgrace,\n\nSpeak, and I and all my courtiers Queen Kaikeyi\'s hest obey,  \nFor thy might is boundless, Empress, limitless thy regal sway!\n\nRolls my chariot-wheel revolving from the sea to farthest sea,  \nAnd the wide earth is my empire, monarchs list my proud decree,\n\nNations of the eastern regions and of Sindhu\'s western wave,  \nBrave Saurashtras and the races who the ocean\'s dangers brave,\n\nVangas, Angas and Magadhas, warlike Matsyas of the west,  \nKasis and the southern races, brave Kosalas first and best,\n\nNations of my world-wide empire, rich in corn and sheep and kine,  \nAll shall serve my Queen Kaikeyi and their treasures all are thine,\n\nSpeak, command thy king a obedience, and thy wrath will melt away,  \nLike the melting snow of winter \'neath the sun\'s reviving ray!"\n\nBlinded was the ancient husband as he lifted up her head,  \nHeedless oath and word he plighted that her wish should be obeyed,\n\nScheming for a fatal purpose, inly then Kaikeyi smiled,  \nAnd by sacred oath and promise bound the monarch love-beguiled:\n\n"Thou hast given, Dasa-ratha, troth and word and royal oath,  \nThree and thirty Gods be witness, watchers of the righteous truth,\n\nSun and Moon and Stars be witness, Sky and Day and sable Night,  \nRolling Worlds and this our wide Earth, and each dark and unseen wight,\n\nWitness Rangers of the forest, Household Gods that guard us both,  \nMortal beings and Immortal,--witness ye the monarch\'s oath,\n\nEver faithful to his promise, ever truthful in his word,  \nDasa-ratha grants my prayer, Spirits and the Gods have heard!\n\nCall to mind, O righteous monarch, days when in a bygone strife,  \nWarring with thy foes immortal thou hadst almost lost thy life,\n\nWith a woman\'s loving tendance poor Kaikeyi cured thy wound,  \nTill from death and danger rescued, thou wert by a promise bound,\n\nTwo rewards my husband offered, what my loving heart might seek,  \nLong delayed their wished fulfilment,-now let poor Kaikeyi speak,\n\nAnd if royal deeds redeem not what thy royal lips did say,  \nVictim to thy broken promise Queen Kaikeyi dies to-day!\n\n_\n\nBy these rites ordained for Rama,-such the news my menials bring,--  \nLet my Bharat, and not Rama, be anointed Regent King,\n\nWearing skins and matted tresses, in the cave or hermit\'s cell,  \nFourteen years in Dandak\'s forests let the elder Rama dwell,\n\nThese are Queen Kaikeyi\'s wishes, these are boons for which I pray,  \nI would see my son anointed, Rama banished on this day!"\n\n_\n\n## VI\n\n## THE KING\'S LAMENT\n\nIs this torturing dream or madness, do my feeble senses fail,  \nO\'er my darkened mind and bosom doth a fainting fit prevail?\n\nSo the stricken monarch pondered and in hushed and silent fear,  \nLooked on her as on a tigress looks the dazed and stricken deer,\n\nLying on the unswept pavement still he heaved the choking sigh,  \nLike a wild and hissing serpent quelled by incantations high!\n\nSobs convulsive shook his bosom and his speech and accent failed,  \nAnd a dark and deathlike faintness o\'er his feeble soul prevailed,\n\nStunned awhile remained the monarch, then in furious passion woke.  \nAnd his eyeballs flamed with redfire, to the queen as thus he spoke:\n\n"Traitress to thy king and husband, fell destroyer of thy race,  \nWherefore seeks thy ruthless rancour Rama rich in righteous grace,\n\nTraitress to thy kith and kindred, Rama loves thee as thy own,  \nWherefore then with causeless vengeance as a mother hate thy son!\n\nHave I courted thee, Kaikeyi, throned thee in my heart of truth,  \nNursed thee in my home and bosom like a snake of poisoned tooth,\n\nHave I courted thee, Kaikeyi, placed thee on Ayodhya\'s throne,  \nThat my Rama, loved of people, thou shouldst banish from his own?\n\nBanish far my Queen Kausalya, Queen Sumitra saintly wife,  \nWrench from me my ancient empire, from my bosom wrench my life,\n\nBut with brave and princely Rama never can his father part,  \nTill his ancient life is ended, cold and still his beating heart!\n\nSunless roll the world in darkness, rainless may the harvests thrive,  \nBut from ri~hteous Rama severed, never can his sire survive,\n\nFeeble is thy aged husband, few and brief on earth his day,  \nLend me, wife, a woman\'s kindness, as a consort be my stay!\n\nAsk for other boon, Kaikeyi, aught my sea-girt empire yields,  \nWealth or treasure, gem or jewel, castled town or smiling fields,\n\nAsk for other gift, Kaikeyi, and thy wishes shall be given,  \nStain me not with crime unholy in the eye of righteous Heaven!"\n\nColdly spake the Queen Kaikeyi: "If thy royal heart repent,  \nBreak thy word and plighted promise, let thy royal faith be rent,\n\nEver known for truth and virtue, speak to peers and monarchs all,  \nWhen from near and distant regions they shall gather in thy hall,\n\nSpeak if so it please thee, monarch, of thy evil-destined wife,  \nHow she loved with wife\'s devotion, how she served and saved thy life,\n\nHow on plighted promise trusting for a humble boon she sighed,  \nHow a monarch broke his promise, how a cheated woman died!"\n\n"Fair thy form," resumed the monarch, "beauty dwells upon thy face,  \nWoman\'s winsome charms bedeck thee, and a woman\'s peerless grace,\n\nWherefore then within thy bosom wakes this thought of cruel wile,  \nAnd what dark and loathsome spirit stains thy heart with blackest guile?\n\nEver since the day, Kaikeyi, when a gentle bride you came,  \nBy a wife\'s unfailing duty you have won a woman\'s fame,\n\nWherefore now this cruel purpose hath a stainless heart defiled,  \nRuthless wish to send my Rama to the dark and pathless wild?\n\nWherefore, darkly-scheming woman, on unrighteous purpose bent,  \nDoth thy cruel causeless vengeance on my Rama seek a vent,\n\nWherefore seek by deeds unholy for thy son the throne to win,  \nThrone which Bharat doth not covet,-blackened byhis mother\'s sin?\n\nShall I see my banished Rama mantled in the garb of woe,  \nReft of home and kin and empire to the pathless jungle go,\n\nShall I see disasters sweeping o\'er my empire dark and deep,  \nAs the forces of a foeman o\'er a scattered army sweep?\n\nShall I hear assembled monarchs in their whispered voices say,  \nWeak and foolish in his dotapre, Dasa-ratha holds his sway,\n\nShall I say to righteous elders when they blame my action done,  \nThat by woman\'s mandate driven I have banished thus my son?\n\nQueen Kansalya, dear-loved woman! she who serves me as a slave,  \nSoothes me like a tender sister, helps me like a consort brave,\n\nAs a fond and loving mother tends me with a watchful care,  \nAs a daughter ever duteous doth obeisance sweet and fair,\n\nWhen my fond and fair Kausalya asks me of her banished son,  \nHow shall Dasa-ratha answer for the impious action done,\n\nHow can husband, cold and cruel, break a wife\'s confiding heart,  \nHow can father, false and faithless, from his best and eldest part?"\n\nColdly spake the Queen Kaikeyi: "If thy royal heart repent,  \nBreak thy word and plighted promise, let thy royal faith be rent,\n\nTruth-abiding is our monarch, so I heard the people say,  \nAnd his word is all inviolate, stainless virtue marks his sway,\n\nLet it now be known to nations,--righteous Dasa-ratha lied,  \nAnd a trusting, cheated woman broke her loving heart and died!"\n\nDarker grew the shades of midnight, coldly shone each distant star,  \nWilder in the monarch\'s bosom raged the struggle and the war:\n\n"Starry midnight, robed in shadows! give my wearied heart relief,  \nSpread thy sable covering mantle o\'er an impious monarch\'s grief,\n\nSpread thy vast and inky darkness o\'er a deed of nameless crime,  \nReign perennial o\'er my sorrows heedless of the lapse of time,\n\nMay a sinful monarch perish ere the dawning of the day,  \nO\'er a dark life sin-polluted, beam not morning\'s righteous ray!"\n\n## VII\n\n## THE SENTENCE\n\nMorning came and duteous Rama to the palace bent his way,  \nFor to make his salutation and his due obeisance pay,\n\nAnd he saw his aged father shorn of kingly pomp and pride,  \nAnd he saw the Queen Kaikeyi sitting by her consort\'s side.\n\nDuteously the righteous Rama touched the ancient monarch\'s feet,  \nTouched the feet of Queen Kaikeyi with a son\'s obeisance meet,\n\n"Rama!" cried the feeble monarch, but the tear bedimmed his eye,  \nSorrow choked his failing utterance and his bosom heaved a sigh,\n\nRama started in his terror at his father\'s grief or wrath,  \nLike a traveller in the jungle crossed by serpent in his path!\n\nReft of sense appeared the monarch, crushed beneath a load of pain,  \nHeaving oft a sigh of sorrow as his heart would break in twain,\n\nLike the ocean tempest-shaken, like the sun in eclipse pale,  \nLike a crushed repenting rishi when his truth and virtue fail!\n\nBreathless mused the anxious Rama,--what foul action hath he done,  \nWhat strange anger fills his father, wherefore greets he not his son?\n\n"Speak, my mother," uttered Rama," what strange error on my part.  \nUnremembered sin or folly fills with grief my father\'s heart,\n\nGracious unto me is father with a father\'s boundless grace,  \nWherefore clouds his altered visage, wherefore tears bedew his face?\n\nDoth a piercing painful ailment rack his limbs with cruel smart,  \nDoth some secret silent anguish wring his tom and tortured heart,\n\nBharat lives with brave Satrughns, in thy father\'s realms afar,  \nHath some cloud of dark disaster crossed their bright auspicious star?\n\nDuteously the royal consorts on the loving monarch wait,  \nHath some woe or dire misfortune dimmed the lustre of their fate.\n\nI would yield my life and fortune ere I wound my father\'s heart,  \nRath my unknown crime or folly caused his ancient bosom smart!\n\nEver dear is Queen Kaikeyi to her consort and her king,  \nHath some angry accent escaped thee thus his royal heart to wring,\n\nSpeak, my ever-lovinging mother, speak the truth, for thou must know,  \nWhat distress or deep disaster pains his heart and clouds his brow?"\n\nMother\'s love nor woman\'s pity moved the deep-determined queen,  \nAs in cold and cruel accents thus she spake her purpose keen:\n\n"Grief nor woe nor sudden ailment pains thy father loved of old,  \nBut he fears to speak his purpose to his Rama true and bold,\n\nAnd his loving accents falter some unloving wish to tell,  \nTill you give your princely promise, you Will serve his mandate well!\n\nListen more, in bygone seasons,--Rama thou wert then unborn,  \nI had saved thy royal father, he a gracious boon had sworn,\n\nBut his feeble heart repenting is by pride and passion stirred,  \nHe would break his royal promise as a caitiff breaks his word,\n\nYears have passed and now the monarch would his ancient word forego,  \nHe would build a needless causeway when the waters ceased to flow!\n\nTruth inspires each deed attempted and each word by monarchs spoke,  \nNot for thee, though loved and honoured, should a royal vow be broke,\n\nIf the true and righteous Rama binds him by his father\'s vow,  \nI will tell thee of the anguish which obscures his royal brow,\n\nIf thy feeble bosom falter and thy halting purpose fail,  \nUnredeemed is royal promise and unspoken is my tale!\n\n"Speak thy word," exclaimed the hero, "and my purpose shall not fail,  \nRama serves his father\'s mandate and his bosom shall not quail,\n\nPoisoned cup or death untimely,--what the cruel fates decree,  \nTo his king and to his father Rama yields obedience free,\n\nSpeak my father\'s royal promise, hold me by his promise tied,  \nRama speaks and shall not palter, for his lips have never lied."\n\nCold and clear Kaikeyi\'s accents fell as falls the hunter\'s knife,  \n"Listen then to word of promise and redeem it with thy life,\n\nWounded erst by foes immortal, saved by Queen Kaikeyi\'s care,  \nTwo great boons your father plighted and his royal words were fair,\n\nI have sought their due fulfilment,--brightly shines my Bharat\'s star.  \nBharat shall be Heir and Regent, Rama shall be banished far!\n\n_\n\nIf thy father\'s royal mandate thou wouldst list and honour still,  \nFourteen years in Dandak\'s forest live and wander at thy will,\n\nSeven long years and seven, my Rama, thou shalt in the jungle dwell,  \nBark of trees shall be thy raiment and thy home the hermit\'s cell,\n\nOver fair Kosala\'s empire let my princely Bharat reign,  \nWith his cars and steeds and tuskers, wealth and gold and armed men!\n\n_\n\nTender-hearted is the monarch, age and sorrow dim his eye,  \nAnd the anguish of a father checks his speech and purpose high,\n\nFor the love he bears thee, Rama, cruel vow he may not speak,  \nI have spoke his will and mandate, and thy true obedience seek."\n\nCalmly Rama heard the mandate, grief nor anger touched his heart,  \nCalmly from his father\'s empire and his home prepared to part.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book III: The Death of the King](rama03.htm)\n\n'
