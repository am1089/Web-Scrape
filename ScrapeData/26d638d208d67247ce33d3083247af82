Agni has been wakened by the fuel of men, in face of the Dawn who\napproaches like a milch-cow. His flames stream forward to the sky like quick\n(birds) that fly up to a branch.\n\n2\\. The Hot _ri_ has been wakened that there may be sacrifice for the gods.\nGracious Agni has stood upright in the morning. When he has been kindled, his\nbrilliant stream of flames has been seen. The great god has been released from\ndarkness.\n\n3\\. When he has wakened the string of the crowd (of worshippers)\n[1](sbe46105.htm#an_5:1:3:1), the bright Agni anoints himself with bright cows\n[2](sbe46105.htm#an_5:1:3:2). Then the Dakshi _n_ a is yoked, striving for\ngain [3](sbe46105.htm#an_5:1:3:3). He who stands upright has, by the\nsacrificial ladles, sucked her who lies extended [4](sbe46105.htm#an_5:1:3:4).\n\n4\\. Towards Agni the minds of the pious turn together as (all) eyes (turn) to\nthe sun. When both Dawns of different colour [1](sbe46105.htm#an_5:1:4:1) give\nbirth to him, the white racer is born at the beginning of days.\n\n5\\. For He, the noble one, has been born at the beginning of days, the red one\nhas been laid down in the woods that have been laid down. Agni, the Hot _ri_ ,\nthe best sacrificer, has sat down, bestowing his seven treasures on every\nhouse.\n\n6\\. Agni, the Hot _ri_ , the best sacrificer, sat down in the mother's lap, in\nthe sweet-smelling place, the young sage growing up in many places, the\nrighteous one, the supporter of tribes, and kindled in their midst.\n\np. 364\n\n7\\. They magnify with adorations that priest efficacious at sacrifices, Agni\nthe Hot _ri_ , who has spread himself over heaven and earth according to _Ri_\nta; they groom (Agni), the own racer (of men), with Gh _ri_ ta.\n\n8\\. He who likes to be groomed, is groomed in his own (abode), the house-\nfriend [1](sbe46105.htm#an_5:1:8:1), praised by sages, our auspicious guest,\nthe bull with a thousand horns who has the strength of such a one. O Agni! By\nthis power thou surpassest all other (beings).\n\n9\\. O Agni! Thou overtakest all other (beings) in one moment (for the sake of\nhim) to whom Thou hast become visible as the fairest one, thou who shouldst be\nmagnified, the wonderful, brilliant one, the beloved guest of human clans.\n\n10\\. To thee, O youngest (god), the tribes bring tribute, O Agni, from near\nand far. Behold [1](sbe46105.htm#an_5:1:10:1) the grace of the most glorious\n(god)! Mighty, O Agni, is thy great and glorious shelter.\n\n11\\. Mount to-day, O shining Agni, the shining car, in the neighbourhood of\nthe worshipful (gods). Knowing the paths, the wide air\n[1](sbe46105.htm#an_5:1:11:1), bring hither the gods that they may eat the\noblation.\n\n12\\. We have pronounced an adoring speech to the holy sage, to the manly bull.\nGavish _th_ ira adoringly has sent his song of praise to Agni as the gold (i.\ne. the sun) far-reaching (is sent by the gods upward) to the sky.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe _Ri_ shis are Budha \xc3\x82treya (cf. verse 1, abodhi) and Gavish _th_ ira\n\xc3\x82treya (cf. verse 12). The metre is Trish _t_ ubh.--Verse 1 = SV. I, 73; AV.\nXIII, 2, 46; VS. XV, 24; TS.\n\np. 365\n\n[paragraph continues] IV, 4, 4, 1. Verses 1-2 = MS. II, 13, 7. Verses 1-3 =\nSV. II, 1096-1098\\. Verse 5 = TS. IV, I, 3, 4. Verse 6 = MS. IV, 11, 1; TB. I,\n3, 14, 1. Verse 9 = TB. II, 4, 7, 10. Verse 10 = MS. IV, 11, 4; TB. II, 4, 7,\n9. Verse 12 = MS. II, 13, 7; TB. IV, 4, 4, 2; VS. XV, 25.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. The meaning seems to be: when Agni has set into motion the string\n(representing the prayers, &c.) by which the worshippers tie and instigate him\nand the other powers of the sacrifice. Cf. IV, I, 9. pra tam (scil. agnim)\nmahya\xc2\xb4 ra _s_ anaya nayanti; IX, 87, 1. a _s_ vam na tva (scil. somam) va _g_\ninam mar _g_ ayanta _h_ a _k_ _kh_ a barhi _h_ ra _s_ ana\xc2\xb4bhi _h_ nayanti. See\nalso I, 163, 4. 5.\n\nNote 2. I. e. with bright gh _ri_ ta.\n\nNote 3. The Dakshi _n_ a or sacrificial gift offered by the Ya _g_ amana to\nthe ministrant priests, is represented here as a car which is yoked in the\nmorning. Cf. Bergaigne, Rel. Vedique, I, 128; III, 283.\n\nNote 4. 'He who stands upright' is Agni; 'she who lies extended' seems to be\nthe cow, i. e. the gh _ri_ ta which Agni sucks by means of the sacrificial\nladles.--See also Pischel, Vedische Studien, II, 113, from whose\ninterpretation I differ.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. I. e. Night and Dawn.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. I cannot adopt the conjectures of Bartholomae (Bezzenberger's\nBeitrage, XV, 197) on sve damuna _h_.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. The human worshipper seems to be addressed; the 'most glorious one' is\nvery probably Agni.\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. Vidvan, which may be construed with the genitive or with the\naccusative, stands here with both cases.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 2](sbe46106.htm)\n\n"
