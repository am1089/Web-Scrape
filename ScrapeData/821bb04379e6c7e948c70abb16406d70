Now at a _S_ raddha ceremony, at that which is celebrated on the Parvan\nday, or for the attainment of special wishes, or at the \xc3\x82bhyudayika _S_ raddha\n(i.e. the _S_ raddha celebrated when some good luck has happened), or at the\nEkoddish _t_ a _S_ raddha (the _S_ raddha directed to a single dead person)\xc2\x97\n\n2\\. He causes Brahma _n_ as who are endowed with learning, moral character,\nand correct conduct, or with one of these (characteristics), who have been\ninvited in time, who have taken a bath, washed their feet, and sipped water,\nto sit down, as representatives of the Fathers, with their faces turned to the\nnorth, one for each one of the Fathers, or two for each, or three for each.\n\n3\\. The larger their number is, the greater is the reward (which the\nsacrificer is entitled to expect).\n\n4\\. But in no case one (Brahma _n_ a) for all (the fathers).\n\np. 251\n\n5 5. Optionally (he may invite only one Brahma _n_ a) except at the first (\n_S_ raddha).\n\n6 6. By (the exposition of) the Pi _n_ _d_ a sacrifice (the corresponding\nrules) have been declared (for the _S_ raddha ceremonies also).\n\n7\\. Having given water (to the Brahma _n_ as),\n\n8 8. Having given to them double-folded Darbha blades, and a seat,\n\n9 9. Having (again) given water (to them),\n\n10\\. Having poured water into three vessels of metal, of stone, and of\nearthen-ware, or (into three vessels) made of the same substance, over which\nhe has put Darbha grass,\n\nAnd having recited over (that water the verse), 'For luck and help the divine\nwaters' (Rig-veda X, 9, 4), he pours sesamum seeds into it with (the formula),\n'Sesamum art thou; Soma is thy deity; at the Gosava sacrifice thou hast been\ncreated by\n\np. 252\n\nthe gods. By the ancients thou hast been offered. Through the funeral oblation\nrender the Fathers and these worlds propitious to us. Svadha! Adoration!'\n\n12 12. (The different rites are performed) from the right to the left.\n\n13 13. With (the part) of the other (i.e. left) hand between the thumb (and\nthe fore-finger), because he wears the sacrificial cord over _h_ is left\nshoulder, or with the right hand which he seizes with the left (he offers the\nArghya water to the Fathers with the words), 'Father, this is thy Arghya.\nGrandfather, this is thy Arghya. Great-grandfather, this is thy Arghya'\xc2\x97having\nfirst offered (ordinary) water (to the Fathers).\n\n14\\. When he is going to hand over that (Arghya water to the Brahma _n_ as who\nrepresent the Fathers, he says once each time), 'Svadha! The Arghya water!'\n\n15 15. Over (the Arghya water) which has been\n\np. 253\n\npoured out, he should recite the verse, 'The celestial waters which have been\nproduced on the earth, the aerial waters and the waters which are terrestrial,\nthe gold-coloured ones, apt for sacrifice, may these waters bring us luck and\nbe kind to us.' Pouring together what has been left (in the three Arghya\nvessels) he moistens his face with that water, if he desires that a son should\nbe born to him.\n\n16 16. 'He should not take up the first vessel, into which the Arghya water\nfor the Fathers has been poured. Hidden the Fathers dwell therein: thus _S_\naunaka has said.'\n\n17 17. In that moment the gifts of perfumes, garlands, incense, lights, and\nclothes are offered (to the Brahma _n_ as).\n\n18\\. Having taken some food (of the Sthalipaka prepared for the Pi _n_ _d_\napit _ri_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a), and having besmeared it with ghee, he asks (the\nBrahma _n_ as) for their permission by saying, 'I shall offer it in the fire,'\nor, 'I will sacrifice my offering in the fire,' or, 'I will offer it in the\nfire.'\n\n19\\. The permission (is given in the words), 'It may be offered,' or,\n'Sacrifice thy offering,' or, Offer it.'\n\n20 20. He then sacrifices in the fire as stated above,\n\np. 254\n\n21 21. Or, if they give their permission, in the hands (of the Brahma _n_ as).\n\n22\\. 'The mouth of the gods verily is the fire, the mouth of the Fathers is\nthe hand'\xc2\x97thus says the Brahma _n_ a.\n\n23\\. If in the hands, he assigns to them other food, after they have sipped\nwater.\n\n24 24. The food (is put together) with the food.\n\n25 25. It is said, 'What is given away and offered, that brings prosperity.'\n\n26 26. When he sees that they are satiated, he should recite (the verses)\ncontaining the word m a dh u, and (the verse), 'They have eaten, they have\nenjoyed themselves' (Rig-veda I, 82, 2).\n\n27 27. Having asked them, 'Relished?' and having taken the food, whatever food\nhe has used, together with the Sthalipaka, in order to make lumps thereof, he\nshould offer the rest (to the Brahma _n_ as).\n\n28\\. After they have either accepted (that rest of food), or left it (to him),\nand have finished eating, he should, before they have sipped water, put down\nthe lumps for the Fathers.\n\np. 255\n\n29\\. After they have sipped water, according to some (teachers).\n\n30 30. Having strewn the food on the ground and suspended the sacrificial cord\nover his left shoulder, he should dismiss the Brahma _n_ as, (saying to them),\n'Say Om! Svadha!'\n\n31\\. Or, 'So be it! Svadha!'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[250:1](sbe29152.htm#fr_623) 7, 1. Comp. on the _S_ raddha ceremonies in\ngeneral the note on _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya IV, 1, 1, and the quotations\ngiven there. The Parva _n_ a _S_ raddha, which is celebrated on the new-moon\nday, is treated of by _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana IV, 1, the \xc3\x82bhyudayika _S_ raddha, IV, 4,\nthe Ekoddish _t_ a _S_ raddha, IV, 2.\n\n[251:5](sbe29152.htm#fr_624) Anadye. Of the different interpretations of this\nword which Naraya _n_ a gives, it may suffice here to quote two. The first _S_\nraddha may either mean the Parva _n_ a _S_ raddha, because this stands first\namong the different kinds of _S_ raddha ceremonies enumerated in Sutra 1; or\nit may mean the Sapi _n_ _d_ ikara _n_ a (see Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khayana IV, 3), for this is\nthe first occasion on which a dead person receives _S_ raddha oblations\ntogether with two others of the Fathers.\n\n[251:6](sbe29152.htm#fr_625) The sacrifice to the Manes, as forming part of\nthe _S_ rauta ritual, is explained in the _S_ rauta-sutra II, 6 seq.\n\n[251:8](sbe29152.htm#fr_626) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 229.\n\n[251:9](sbe29152.htm#fr_627) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 230. The reading of several\nwords of the Mantra is doubtful, and the parallel texts, as Prof. Stenzler has\nnot failed to observe, differ; especially the words pratnavadbhi _h_ pratta\n_h_ seem to me to be corrupt. The word pratnavat is only known to the\nPetersburg Dictionary as having the meaning, 'containing the word pratna,'\nwhich will not do here. Thus, I think that the reading pratnam adbhi _h_ p\n_ri_ kta _h_ should be adopted; the translation would be, 'Anciently thou hast\nbeen mixed with water.'\n\n[252:12](sbe29152.htm#fr_628) Comp. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya IV, 4, 6.\n\n[252:13](sbe29152.htm#fr_629) The part of the hand above the thumb is called\nthe 'Tirtha belonging to the Manes;' see, for instance, Baudhayana's Dharma-\nsutra I, 8, 16. The sacrificer is here understood to wear his sacrificial cord\nsuspended over the left shoulder (he is 'ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ opavitin'). But as the\noblation here treated of is directed to the Manes, it is required that he\nshould be pra _k_ inavitin. Now he is considered as pra _k_ inavitin,\naccording to Naraya _n_ a, not only if the cord is suspended over his right\nshoulder (which is the ordinary meaning of pra _k_ inavitin), but also if the\nhand with which he performs the rites, and the shoulder over which he wears\nthe sacred cord, are either both right or both left. Thus here, acting with\nthe left-hand and wearing the cord over the left shoulder, he becomes pra _k_\ninavitin.\n\nThe last word (appurvam) is separated by Naraya _n_ a from the rest, so that\nit forms a separate Sutra.\n\n[252:15](sbe29152.htm#fr_630) The sacrificer gives the water to the Brahma _n_\nas, and these p. 253 pour it out. Instead of p _ri_ thivi sambabhuvu _h_ (p\n_ri_ thivi being intended as a locative; see Lanman, Noun-inflection in the\nVeda, p. 389) we should read, no doubt, as the parallel texts have, payasa\nsambabhuvu _h_ : 'The celestial waters which have united themselves with\nmilk.'\n\n[253:16](sbe29152.htm#fr_631) This is a _S_ loka.\n\n[253:17](sbe29152.htm#fr_632) Manu III, 209; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 231.\n\n[253:20](sbe29152.htm#fr_633) The oblations alluded to in this Sutra are\nprescribed in the _S_ rauta-sutra, II, 6, 12. They are directed to Soma pit\n_ri_ mat and to Agni kavyavahana.\n\n[254:21](sbe29152.htm#fr_634) According to Manu (III, 212) this is done only\nin case there is no fire. Possibly abhyanu _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ayam belongs to Sutra 20,\nso that we should have to translate, 'He then sacrifices . . . if they give\ntheir permission. Or in the hands.'\n\n[254:24](sbe29152.htm#fr_635) 'The food which is left from the oblations he\nputs with the food (Sutra 23) which is to be eaten by the Brahma _n_ as, and\nhas been put into the vessels.' Naraya _n_ a.\n\n[254:25](sbe29152.htm#fr_636) Is s _ri_ sh _t_ am to be understood in the\nsense of vis _ri_ sh _t_ am? Naraya _n_ a explains it by prabhutam.\n\n[254:26](sbe29152.htm#fr_637) The verses containing the word madhu are Rig-\nveda I, 90, 6-8.\n\n[254:27](sbe29152.htm#fr_638) On the question, 'Relished?' compare _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya IV, 2, 5. For several kinds of _S_ raddha ceremonies a\nSthalipaka is prescribed, for others it is not; for the _S_ raddhas of the\nlast kind the words 'Together with the Sthalipaka' are not valid.\n\n[255:30](sbe29152.htm#fr_639) They reply, 'Om! Svadha!'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 8](sbe29153.htm)\n\n"
