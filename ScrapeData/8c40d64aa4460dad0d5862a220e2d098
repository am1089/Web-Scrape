G\xc4\x81rg\xc4\xab and Y\xc4\x81jnavalkya 1\n\n"Y\xc4\x81jnavalkya," said she, "as a warrior from the land of K\xc4\x81\xc5\x9bi or Videha might\nstring his unstrung bow and come forward holding in his hand two arrows to\npierce through his foe, even so I have come forward against thee with two\nquestions; answer me them."\n\n"Ask, G\xc4\x81rg\xc4\xab."\n\n"Y\xc4\x81jnavalkya," said she, "that which is above the heavens, which is beneath\nthe earth, which is midway between the heavens and the earth, which they call\n_What hath_ _been, What is,_ and _What shall be_ --in what is it woven and\nwoofed?"\n\n"G\xc4\x81rg\xc4\xab," said he, "that which is above the heavens, which is below the earth,\nwhich is midway between the heavens and the earth, which they call _What hath\nbeen, What_ _is,_ and _What shall be,_ is woven and woofed in the ether."\n\n"Homage to thee, Y\xc4\x81jnavalkya," said she. "for thou hast answered me this; make\nready for the other."\n\n"Ask, G\xc4\x81rg\xc4\xab."\n\np. 73\n\n"Y\xc4\x81jnavalkya," said she, "that which is above the heavens, which is below the\nearth, which is midway between the heavens and the earth, which they call\n_What hath_ _been, What is,_ and _What shall be_ --in what is it woven and\nwoofed?"\n\n"G\xc4\x81rg\xc4\xab," said he, "that which is above the heavens, which is below the earth,\nwhich is midway between the heavens and the earth, which they call _What hath\nbeen, What_ _is,_ and _What shall be,_ is woven and woofed in the ether."\n\n"And in what is the ether woven and woofed?"\n\n"G\xc4\x81rg\xc4\xab," said he, "that is what Brahmans call the Unfading; it is not gross,\nnot fine, not short, not long, not red, not fluid, not shadow, not darkness,\nnot wind, not ether, not clinging, without taste, without smell, without eye,\nwithout ear, without speech, without mind, without vital force, without\nbreath, without mouth, without measure, without aught inward, without aught\noutward; it consumes nothing, none consumes it. At the behest of the Unfading,\nG\xc4\x81rg\xc4\xab, sun and moon are held asunder; at the behest of the Unfading, G\xc4\x81rg\xc4\xab,\nheaven and earth are held asunder; at the behest of the Unfading, G\xc4\x81rg\xc4\xab,\nminutes, hours, days and nights, fortnights, months, seasons, and years are\nheld asunder; at the behest of the Unfading, G\xc4\x81rg\xc4\xab, flow the rivers, some\neastward from the white mountains, some westward, each in its own way. At the\nbehest of the Unfading, G\xc4\x81rg\xc4\xab, men praise\n\np. 74\n\ngivers, the Gods hang upon the sacrifice-giver, the Fathers upon the ladle.\nIndeed, G\xc4\x81rg\xc4\xab, to him who makes oblation and sacrifice, and mortifies himself\nin this world for many thousands of years without knowing the Unfading, it\ncomes to an end. Indeed, G\xc4\x81rg\xc4\xab, he who departs from this world without knowing\nthe Unfading is wretched. But he who departs from this world knowing the\nUnfading, G\xc4\x81rg\xc4\xab, is the Brahman. Indeed, G\xc4\x81rg\xc4\xab, the Unfading unseen sees,\nunheard hears, unthought thinks, uncomprehended comprehends. There is naught\nelse than this which sees, naught else that hears, naught else that thinks,\nnaught else that comprehends. In the Unfading, forsooth, G\xc4\x81rg\xc4\xab, is the ether\nwoven and woofed."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[72:1](brk36.htm#fr_32) B\xe1\xb9\x9bihad-\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87yaka Upanishad, III. viii. 2-11.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IX: The Everlasting Nay](brk37.htm)\n\n'
