Indra slew Tvash _t_ _ri_ 's son, Vi _s_ varupa. Seeing his son\nslain, Tvash _t_ _ri_ exorcized him (Indra), and\n\np. 214\n\nbrought Soma juice suitable for witchery 1, and withheld from Indra. Indra by\nforce drank off his Soma-juice, thereby committing a desecration of the\nsacrifice. He went asunder in every direction, and his energy, or vital power\n2, flowed away from every limb.\n\n12:7:1:22\\. From his eyes his fiery spirit flowed, and became that grey\n(smoke-coloured) animal, the he-goat; and what (flowed) from his eyelashes\nbecame wheat, and what (flowed) from his tears became the kuvala-fruit 3.\n\np. 215\n\n12:7:1:33\\. From his nostrils his vital power flowed, and became that animal,\nthe ram; and what (flowed) from the phlegm became the Indra-grain, and what\nmoisture there was that became the badara-fruit 1.\n\n12:7:1:44\\. From his mouth his strength flowed, it became that animal, the\nbull; and what foam there was became barley, and what moisture there was\nbecame the karkandhu-fruit 1.\n\n12:7:1:55\\. From his ear his glory flowed, and became the one-hoofed animals,\nthe horse, mule, and ass.\n\n12:7:1:66\\. From the breasts his bright (vital) sap flowed, and became milk,\nthe light of cattle; from the heart in his breast his courage flowed, and\nbecame the talon-slaying eagle, the king of birds.\n\n12:7:1:77\\. From his navel his life-breath flowed, and became lead,--not iron,\nnor silver; from his seed his form flowed, and became gold; from his\ngenerative organ his essence flowed, and became parisrut (raw fiery liquor);\nfrom his hips his fire flowed, and became surd (matured liquor), the essence\nof food.\n\n12:7:1:88\\. From his urine his vigour flowed, and became the wolf, the\nimpetuous rush of wild beasts; from the contents of his intestines his fury\nflowed, and became the tiger, the king of wild beasts; from his blood his\nmight flowed, and became the lion, the ruler of wild beasts.\n\n12:7:1:99\\. From his hair his thought flowed, and became millet; from his skin\nhis honour flowed, and became the a _s_ vattha tree (ficus religiosa); from\nhis flesh his force flowed, and became the udumbara tree (ficus glomerata);\nfrom his bones his sweet drink flowed,\n\np. 216\n\nand became the nyagrodha tree (ficus indica); from his marrow his drink, the\nSoma juice, flowed, and became rice: in this way his energies, or vital\npowers, went from him.\n\n12:7:1:1010\\. Now at that time he (Indra) had to do with Namu _k_ i, the\nAsura. Namu _k_ i bethought him, 'He has been undone once for all: I will\nseize upon his energy, his vital power, his Soma-drink, his food,' By (taking)\nthat Sura-liquor of his he seized upon his energy, or vital power, his Soma-\ndrink, his food. He lay there dissolved. The gods gathered around him, and\nsaid, 'Verily, he was the best of us; evil has befallen him: let us heal him!'\n\n12:7:1:1111\\. They said to the two A _s_ vins, 'Ye are Brahman physicians:\nheal ye this one!' They replied, 'Let there be a guerdon for us!' They spake,\n'That he-goat there shall be your guerdon.' They said, 'So be it!' and hence\nthe smoke-coloured (he-goat) is sacred to the two A _s_ vins.\n\n12:7:1:1212\\. They (the gods) said to Sarasvati, 'Verily, thou art healing\nmedicine: heal thou this one!' She replied, 'Let there be a guerdon for me!'\nThey spake, 'That ram there shall be thy guerdon!' She said, 'So be it!' and\ntherefore the ram is sacred to Sarasvati.\n\n12:7:1:1313\\. They then spake, 'Verily, there is even now as much in him\n(Indra) as that -bull: that one shall belong to him himself.' They said, 'So\nbe it!' and therefore the bull is sacred to Indra.\n\n12:7:1:1414\\. The two A _s_ vins and Sarasvati, having taken the energy, or\nvital power, from Namu _k_ i, restored them to hire (Indra), and saved him\nfrom evil, 'Truly, we have saved him from evil so as to be well-saved\n(sutrata),' they thought, and this became\n\np. 217\n\nthe Sautrama _n_ i: and this is the (saving) nature of the Sautrama _n_ i\\--it\nsaves the self from death, and repels evil for whosoever thus knows that\n(saving) nature of the Sautrama _n_ i. There are (for this sacrifice) thirty-\nthree Dakshi _n_ as (presents to priests), for thirty-three were the gods who\nhealed him: whence they say, 'Dakshi _n_ as are healing medicine.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[213:2](sbe44065.htm#fr_565) The Sautrama _n_ i is usually classed as one of\nthe seven divisions of the Havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, though, in reality, it is much\nmore than that; its peculiarity consisting in a combination of the ordinary\nfeatures of the Havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, or ish _t_ i (cf. XII, 7, 2, 22), with\nthose of the animal sacrifice, whilst a third important element, viz.\nlibations of spirituous liquor, imparts to it a certain resemblance, and\ndoubtless an intended resemblance, to the Soma-sacrifice. Of this sacrifice we\nhave already met with a variation in connection with the Ra _g_ asuya (cf.\npart iii, p. 229 seq.), that form being usually called the _K_ araka-Sautrama\n_n_ i, as being adopted from the ritual of the _K_ araka-adhvaryus; whilst the\nform described in the remaining portion of the present Ka _n_ _d_ a is,\naccording to La _t_ y. _S_ raut. V, 4, 20, called Kaukili Sautrama _n_ i. (cf.\n\xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_ r. III, 9, 9 comm.; Weber, Ind. Stud. III, p. 385). The name\nitself is derived from 'sutraman,' i.e. 'the good guardian,' as which Indra is\nworshipped in this sacrifice (cf. V, 5, 4. 1 seq.). The whole performance\ntakes four days, during the first three of which the Sura-liquor is prepared\nand matured, and offerings of a rice-pap to Aditi, and a bull to Indra are\nperformed; whilst the main sacrifice takes place on the fourth day--the day of\neither full moon or new moon--the chief oblations offered on that day being\nthree cups of milk, and as many of Sura-liquor, to the A _s_ vins, Sarasvati,\nand Indra respectively; of three animal victims to the same deities; and of\nthirty-three libations of fat gravy, or liquid fat (vasa), obtained from the\ncooking of the victims, and offered by means of bull's hoofs used as cups. At\nthe end of the sacrifice, a third bull is offered to Indra in his form of\nVayodhas (giver of life), together with another pap p. 214 ( _k_ aru) to Aditi\nand an oblation of curds to Mitra and Varu _n_ a. No mention is made of the\nAgnishomiya he-goat usually offered .on the day preceding the Soma-pressing,\nthe first bull offered to Indra probably taking its place on this occasion,\nwhilst the hull to Indra Vayodhas would seem to take the place of the\nsacrifice of a barren cow (to Mitra and Varu _n_ a) which usually takes place\nat the end of a Soma-sacrifice. In an interesting variation (Sautrama _n_ a-ya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a), described in _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh. _S_ r. XIV, 12-13, and performed as a real\n(Agnish _t_ oma) Soma-sacrifice, the final animal sacrifice indeed is that of\na barren cow to Indra Sutraman; only two other victims--a reddish he-goat to\nthe A _s_ vins and a ewe to Sarasvati\\--being mentioned.\n\n[214:1](sbe44065.htm#fr_566) 'Exposed (liable) to witching,' Delbruck,\nAltindische Syntax, p. 401.\n\n[214:2](sbe44065.htm#fr_567) 'Virya' (virile power) is constantly used to\nexplain 'indriya.'\n\n[214:3](sbe44065.htm#fr_568) The words 'kuvala, badara, and karkandhu' are the\nnames of three varieties of the jujube, or fruits of Zizyphus Jujuba, for a\ndescription of which see the comm. on Katy. _S_ r. XIX, 17 seqq. According to\nStewart and Brandis' Forest Flora of North-West and Central India (p. 87),\n'this species varies exceedingly, in the shape and size of the fruits, the\nshape and tomentum of the leaves, and general habit;' 'the Zizyphi of North\nIndia want more investigation on the spot.' . . . 'Lakh is produced on this\ntree in Sindh, the Panjab, and Central India, The bark is used as dye-stuff;\nthe root is a febrifuge in native pharmacy. A gum exudes from the trunk; and\nin Kangra a wild silkworm lives on the tree, the silk of which was much\nemployed formerly to tie the barrel to the stock of the matchlock. But the\ntree is mainly cultivated for its fruit, p. 215 which is more or less globose\non the wild and commoner sorts, and ovoid or oblong on the cultivated and\nimproved kinds.'\n\n[215:1](sbe44065.htm#fr_570) See note 3 on preceding page.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XII, 7, 2.
