The King said :-- O Best of Munis! Hearing these sorrows of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_\na, the part incarnate of Vi _sn_ u Bhagavan, I am in doubt on your utterances.\n\n\n\n2\\. Behold! Bhagavan Vasudeva is the part incarnate of Naraya _n_ a; how could\nthe Asura S\xc2\x92ambara steal away His son from the lying-in-chamber!\n\n\n\n3\\. The beautiful Dvaraka city is specially well-guarded; the lying-in-chamber\nis again within the centre of that; under these circumstances, how was it that\nthe Daitya could enter there and steal away the child!\n\n\n\n4\\. O Son of Satyavati! How was it that Vasudeva could not know that! This\nappears very strange to me!\n\n\n\n5\\. O Brahma _n_ a! Please explain to me why was that child stolen away from\nthe lying-in-chamber, though S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a was staying there at the city;\nand how was it that he was not able to know this beforehand!\n\n\n\n6\\. Vyasa said :-- O King! The Maya called S\xc2\x92ambhavi (Parvati's) is the cause;\nit fascinates and deludes the minds of human beings. Thus it is known to us.\nWho is there in this world that is not deluded by this Maya?\n\n\n\n7\\. The Jivas, no sooner they are born as human beings, are immediately\novercome with human qualities; the Deva or Asura qualities or their natures do\nnot then visibly exist.\n\n\n\np. 347\n\n\n\n8-9. O King! Hunger, thirst, sleep, fear, lassitude, delusion, sorrow, doubt,\npleasure, egoism, old age, disease, death, non-knowledge, knowledge,\ndispleasure, envy, jealousy, pride and weariness; all these human qualities\nare seen to exist in human embodiments.\n\n\n\n10-11. Behold! The night wanderer Rak _s_ asa Maricha assumed, by his Maya,\nthe form of a golden deer and came before S\xc2\x92ri Ramchandra; and Ramchandra was\nnot the least aware of it. Then the stealing away of Sita, the death of Ja _t_\nayu, Rama\xc2\x92s going to the forest on the very day of his installation to the\nthrone of Ayodhya; the death of his father due to his bereavement, all these\nS\xc2\x92ri Ramchandra did not know a bit beforehand.\n\n\n\n12\\. When Rava _n_ a stole away Janaki and carried her by force Rama did not\nknow this before or after that event had happened. He wandered from forest to\nforest in search of Her, like a quite ignorant man.\n\n\n\n13\\. Afterwards He killed Bali, the son of Indra and with the help of the\nmonkeys, erected a bridge across the ocean, and, crossing it, went to Lanka.\n\n\n\n14\\. He sent the chief monkeys to all the quarters in search of Sita and had\nto undergo all the troubles of deadly battles in the great battlefield.\n\n\n\n15\\. The most powerful Raghunandana was tied down by Nagapas\xc2\x92a (snakes) and\nwas afterwards freed from it by Garu _d_ a.\n\n\n\n16\\. Then, being furiously enraged, the great Raghava slew Kumbhakar _n_ a,\nNikumbha, Megha Nada and Rava _n_ a.\n\n\n\n17\\. The Janardan Ramchandra was not aware of the innocence of Sita; and\ntherefore He made her take an oath about the purity of Her character and even\nmade Her undergo an ordeal of fire.\n\n\n\n18\\. Afterwards Ramachandra, the son of Das\xc2\x92aratha, had to banish his dear\nblameless Sita on the mere ground of bad name, imputed to her by some ignorant\nperson and that he would be thus blamed by the public.\n\n\n\n19\\. He did not know that Kus\xc2\x92i and Lava were His two sons, born in the\nforest. Afterwards when the Muni Valmiki told him, He came to know of them.\n\n\n\n20\\. Behold also Ramachandra could not know about the departure of Sita to\nPatala; getting angry once He was about to kill his brother Lak _s_ ma _n_ a\neven.\n\n\n\n21\\. Rama, the slayer of the Rak _s_ \xc2\x92asa Khara did not know that Kala Puru\n_s_ a was coming to him. He, incarnating in the human body, did acts all\nbecoming to a man. Similarly S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, the descendant of Yadu, taking\nhuman birth did acts all like a man. What more discussion can there be in\nthis?\n\n\n\np. 348\n\n\n\n22\\. Lo! From the very outset He fled, out of fear of Kamsa, to Gokula;\nafterwards he fled out of fear of Jarasandha to the Dwarka city.\n\n\n\n23\\. Knowing all the rites and ceremonies of the Sanatan Dharma (the Eternal\nReligion) He stole away Rukmi _n_ i who was chosen as bride elect by\nS\xc2\x92is\xc2\x92upala. This act was very unreligious of Him.\n\n\n\n24\\. S\xc2\x92ambara Daitya stole away his newly born child and Kri _sn_ a lamented\nfor this. Afterwards on coming to know of the real state of things from the\nGoddess Bhagavati, He was very glad. Therefore it can be easily seen from all\nthese circumstances that He had to yield to pleasures and to undergo remorse\nlike ordinary human beings.\n\n\n\n25\\. Again, under the orders of his wife Satyabhama, He had to go to Heaven to\nbring the Parijata tree and He had to fight with Indra. This shows clearly\nthat He was under the subjection of His wife.\n\n\n\n26\\. In that battle Hari with disc in hand defeated Indra; the Lord of the\nDevas, took away the Kalpa tree and retained the prestige of His respected\nwife (whom He had offended).\n\n\n\n27\\. Again Satyabhama tied down Hari against a tree and presented Him as a\ngift to Narada; afterwards she, the passionate woman, freed Kri _sn_ a on\npaying an equivalent of gold coins.\n\n\n\n28-29. On seeing Rukmi _n_ i\xc2\x92s many sons, Pradyumna and others, all qualified\nwith diverse qualifications, His wife Jambavati prayed to S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a with\nhumility, so that she may have also many beautiful sons. For her sake, Kri\n_sn_ a firmly resolved to practise tapasya and went to the place where the\ngreat devotee of S\xc2\x92iva, Upamanyu, was staying.\n\n\n\n30\\. Hari desiring to have sons engaged Upamanyu as His spiritual guide and\nobtained from him the Mantram called Pas\xc2\x92upata Mantra and became a Dundee\n(holder of a staff) and shaved His head.\n\n\n\n31-32. In the first month He subsisted on fruits only and meditated on S\xc2\x92iva\nand repeated silently the S\xc2\x92iva mantra. Thus He practised very severe\nausterities. In the second month He subsisted on water only and stood on only\none leg. In the third month he lived on air only and stood on the end of His\ngreat toe.\n\n\n\n33-36. Thus time passed away. In the sixth month the God Rudra, holding Moon\non His forehead, was pleased with His asceticism and devotion and appeared\nbefore Him on that spot. The God Maha Deva came on a bull; He was attended by\nBrahma and Vi _sn_ u, Indra and the other Devas, Yakshas and Gandarbhas and\naddressed thus :-- \xc2\x93O high minded Kri _sn_ a of Yadu\xc2\x92s descent; I am pleased\nwith Your severe asceticism; now ask Your desired boon; I will grant it just\nnow. I fulfil all the desires of all my devotees;\n\n\n\np. 349\n\n\n\nwhat desire, then, there can be that is not fulfilled, when I am seen by the\ndevotees!\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n37-38. Vyasa said :-- The son of Devaki was very glad to see the God S\xc2\x92amkara\nand fell prostrate at His feet. Then that eternal supreme God of the Devas\nbegan to recite hymns in praise of Him in a tone as deep as the rumbling of a\ncloud.\n\n\n\n39\\. Kri _sn_ a said :-- O Deva of the Devas! O Lord of the world! You alone\ndestroy the misfortunes and sorrows of all the beings. O Destroyer of Asuras!\nYou are the Cause and Creator of this universe. I salute Thee.\n\n\n\n40\\. O One having a blue throat! I bow down to Thee! O Holder of trident! I\nagain and again salute Thee! O Lord of Parvati! You destroyed Dak _s_ a\xc2\x92s\nsacrifice. I salute Thee.\n\n\n\n41\\. I am blessed by Thy sight and think myself as having discharged all my\nduties and satisfied. O Virtuous One! My human birth is crowned with success\nby saluting Thy feet.\n\n\n\n42\\. O Lord of everything! O three-eyed! I am tied down to this world by my\nattachment towards my wives; now I take refuge unto Thee to free me from these\nbonds.\n\n\n\n43\\. O Destroyer of sorrows! I am very much troubled on attaining this human\nbirth; O Bhava! I am afraid of this world; and hence I take refuge unto Thee;\nnow save me.\n\n\n\n44-45. O Destroyer of cupidity! I experienced a good deal of troubles in the\nwomb; next out of fear to Kamsa I had to go to Gokula where I suffered much\npains; there I had to obey the orders of cow-herds; there I had to attend as\nNanda\xc2\x92s cow-herd, the pasturing of his cows and was constantly suffocated with\nthe awful dust thrown up by the cows; I had to wander constantly in the wild\nforests of Brindaban.\n\n\n\n46\\. O Omnipresent One! I had to leave my dear ancestral place, the city of\nMathura, a rare place to be found anywhere else, out of the great fear of Kala\nYavana, the king of the Mlechchas and had to go to Dwaraka city.\n\n\n\n47-48. O Lord! In order to preserve the cause of religion, I had to hand over\nthe best prosperous kingdom to Ugrasena, due to the curse of Yayati. My elders\nmade him the king of the Yadavas; following their examples, I gave him the\nkingdom and am now serving him always like his servant.\n\n\n\n49\\. O S\xc2\x92ambhu! The householder\xc2\x92s life is exceedingly troublesome; it makes\none subject to one\xc2\x92s wife and go against his religion. There we are\n\n\n\np. 350\n\n\n\nalways dependent on others; and no word is heard or dreamt even, how to free\noneself from those bondages of the world. Oh! What an irony of Fate.\n\n\n\n50\\. O Destroyer of cupid! My wife Jambavati, on seeing the sons of my wife\nRukmi _n_ i has urged me to practise this Tapasya so that she might get\nexcellent sons born to her also.\n\n\n\n51\\. O Lord of the Devas! O Lord of the world! I am engaged in this asceticism\nwith the desire to get sons; O Deva! I feel shame in asking you for the sons!\n\n\n\n52\\. You are the lover of your devotees; You give eternal freedom; You are the\nLord of all the Devas. By worshipping and satisfying You, who is so fool as to\nask for this trivial and transient thing!\n\n\n\n53\\. O Omnipresent One! O S\xc2\x92ambhu! O Lord of the world! Knowing You as the\ngiver of salvation, I, still deluded by Maya, ask from You, being requested by\nmy wife, this happiness that sons be born to me of my wife.\n\n\n\n54-55. O S\xc2\x92amkara! This world and its concerns are the abode of all sorrows;\nit is the cause that brings in all sorts of pains and troubles, and it is\ntransient and will go to destruction. I know all these; still my mind does not\ndesist from it.\n\n\n\n56\\. Vyasa said :-- O great and powerful king! The God of Gods, Maha Deva,\nthus praised and adored by Govinda, the Destroyer of enemies, replied :-- You\nwill get many sons.\n\n\n\n57\\. You will get sixteen thousand one hundred wives and no doubt you will get\nten sons of each of them. These sons will be very powerful and valorous.\n\n\n\n58-60. The good-looking S\xc2\x92amkara saying these words remained silent; then S\xc2\x92ri\nKri _sn_ a bowed down at the feet of Girija, the wife of S\xc2\x92amkara. Then the\nGoddess Parvati addressed repeatedly to Vasudeva and said :-- O mighty armed!\nO Kri _sn_ a! O best of human beings! You will be the typical exemplary\nhouseholder; (all people will try to follow you). When one hundred years will\npass away, your race will be extinct, due to the curse of the Brahma _n_ a and\nGandhari.\n\n\n\n61\\. Your sons and the other Yadavas will lose their senses on drinking\nliquor; they will kill each other in the battle field and thus will be\nextirpated.\n\n\n\nNote: Here Vi _sn_ is and Andhkas are meant.\n\n\n\n62\\. Then you and your elder brother Balabhadra (Balarama) will give up your\nbodies and will ascend to the Heavens; O Mighty Person! Do not grieve in\nmatters that cannot be avoided.\n\n\n\np. 351\n\n\n\n63\\. You should know that there can be no remedy to what will inevitably come\nto pass; therefore no one is to grieve for them; this is all along my view.\n\n\n\n64\\. O Madhusudana! After Your death, due to the curse of A _st_ avakra Muni,\nyour wives will be forcibly stolen away by indomitable robbers. There is no\ndoubt in this.\n\n\n\n65\\. Vyasa said :-- When Devi Parvati thus spoke, S\xc2\x92ambhu, with the other gods\ndisappeared; Kri _sn_ a too, bowed down to Upamanyu and went back to the city\nDvarka.\n\n\n\n66-67. Therefore, O King! Though Brahma and the other Devas are heard to be\nthe lords of the world, still they are all being tossed hither an thither by\nthe waves of the ocean of Maya. They are all like wooden dolls subject to\nMaya.\n\n\n\n68\\. As their previous karmas, so their several manifestations in the field of\naction, by the Great Maya, the incarnate of Para Brahma.\n\n\n\n69\\. She has no differences nor any want of mercy; That Goddess of the\nuniverse is always leading the Jivas towards the Eternal Freedom (freedom from\nMaya).\n\n\n\n70\\. Had She not created this world, moving and unmoving and if She had not\nremained there as the Controller of the Jivas in the shape of unshakeable\nconsciousness the Ku _t_ asthya Chaita _n_ ya, this whole world would have\nbecome devoid of any consciousness, like an insentient substance and would\nhave dissolved in the Tamasi Maya (sheer darkness). There is no doubt in this.\n\n\n\n71\\. Therefore that Goddess of the Universe has, through Her mercy, created\nall these worlds and Jivas, and resting incarnate in each Jiva, is directing\neach and every of them according to his karmic merits and demerits.\n\n\n\n72\\. Therefore it is a matter not to be doubted that Brahma and the other gods\nare all under this Maya; the Suras and Asuras are subject to Her.\n\n\n\n73\\. Therefore, O king! Know this as certain that the Great Goddess moves and\nenjoys freely according to Her will; She is not dependent on anybody.\nTherefore it is the duty of everyone to serve and worship, with whole head and\nheart, that Devi.\n\n\n\n74\\. In these three worlds there is nothing higher or more excellent than Her.\nTherefore this birth cannot be crowned with success in any other way than\nremembering that Highest Force, the Para S\xc2\x92akti and Her place.\n\n\n\n75-77. One should always think, without any difference, that Eternal World\nMother, thus \xc2\x93Let me not be born in that family which has not that Supreme\nGoddess for its presiding Deity; I am that Goddess Bhagavati and no other; I\nam Brahma, untouched by sorrows.\xc2\x94 One should hear first from the mouth of\none\xc2\x92s Spiritual Guide; next by hearing Vedanta and\n\n\n\np. 352\n\n\n\nother religious scriptures, one should first form an idea of that Bhagavati;\nand then if one daily meditates on That Goddess, the Highest Self incarnate\nwith one minded devotion, one will get, within a short period, the Eternal\nFreedom; else there is not the least chance, even if one performs lots of\ninnumerable good works of becoming free.\n\n\n\n78\\. S\xc2\x92vetas\xc2\x92vatara and other pure hearted Ri _s_ is obtained this freedom\nfrom the bondages of Maya by meditating, in their hearts, this Highest Self\nand nothing else.\n\n\n\n79\\. Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and the other Devas, Gauri, Lak _s_ mi and other\ngoddesses, all worship This Supreme Goddess, of Sachchidananda Para Brahma _n_\ni.\n\n\n\n80\\. O pure-hearted king! I answered all that you asked me, terrified with the\nfears of this world; what more do you want to hear?\n\n\n\n81-82. O king! I have described this wonderful Pura _n_ a narrative,\ndestructive of sins, productive of virtue. He who daily listens to this\nBhagavatam equal alike to Veda, becomes freed from all sorts of sins and goes\nto the region of the Highest Goddess and passes his time in the midst of the\nHighest Glory. There is no doubt in this.\n\n\n\n83\\. Suta said :-- \xc2\x93O Ri _s_ is! This Sri Mad Bhagavatam, called otherwise the\nFifth Pura _n_ am was recited, in detail, in days of yore by Vyasa. Whatsoever\nI heard from him, I have now told exactly the same to you.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nHere ends the 25th Chapter in the Fourth Skandha of Sri Mad Devi Bhagavatam,\nthe Maha Pura _n_ am, of 18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa on the\nDevi\xc2\x92s Highest Supremacy.\n\n\n\nNote :-- The best mantra is the whole hearted devotion to one\xc2\x92s Guru, and\ndevotion and surrender of one\xc2\x92s Self to the Supreme Mother, doing works\nwithout attachment to the fruits thereof. This will lead to dispassion and\nRenunciation. To one who is faithful in this, all the other mantras will be\nduly revealed and all his desires will be found to be true and fulfilled.\n\n\n\nHere ends as well as the Fourth Skandha.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 1](bk05ch01.htm)\n\n"
