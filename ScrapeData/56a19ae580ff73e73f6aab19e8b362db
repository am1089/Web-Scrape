And because the text states a quality (of the vidya) to be common (to the\nthree Vedas).\n\nThe text states that the syllable Om which is a quality,\n\np. 283\n\ni.e. the abode of a meditation, is common to the three Vedas, 'By that\nsyllable the threefold knowledge proceeds. With Om the Adhvaryu gives orders,\nwith Om the Hot _ri_ recites, with Om the Udgat _ri_ sings.' This suggests\nthat, as the abode of the vidya (viz. the O _m_ kara) is common, the vidyas\nwhich abide in it are common also.--Or else the Sutra may be explained as\nfollows. If the udgitha and so on, which are matters qualifying the\nsacrificial action, were not all of them common to all sacrificial\nperformances, the vidyas resting on them would not go together. But the\nscriptural passages which teach the sacrificial performances and extend over\nall subordinate matters, state that the udgitha and so on are common to all\nperformances. As thus the abodes of the vidyas go together, the vidyas abiding\nin them go together likewise.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 65](sbe38208.htm)\n\n"
