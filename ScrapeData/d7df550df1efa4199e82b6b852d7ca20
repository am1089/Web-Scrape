The\nchildren gather and scatter flowers in reckless sport. And if you come and\ntake one little blossom no one will miss it."\n\nThose that used to play are playing still, so spendthrift is life.\n\nI listen to their chatter and call, "Come back, my darling, for mother\'s heart\nis full to the brim with love, and if you come to snatch only one little kiss\nfrom her no one will grudge it."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The First Jasmines](cm36.htm)\n\n'
