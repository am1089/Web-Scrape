Badhva 1 says, there are four persons (to be meditated on and worshipped).\n\n2\\. The person of the body, the person of the metres, the person of the Veda,\nand the Great person.\n\n3\\. What we call the person of the body is this corporeal self. Its essence is\nthe incorporeal conscious self.\n\n4\\. What we call the person of the metres is this collection of letters (the\nVeda). Its essence is the vowel a.\n\n5\\. What we call the person of the Veda is (the mind) by which we know the\nVedas, the _Ri_ g-veda, Ya _g_ ur-veda, and Sama-veda. Its essence is Brahman\n2(m.)\n\n6\\. Therefore let one chose a Brahman-priest who is full of Brahman (the\nVeda), and is able to see any flaw in the sacrifice.\n\n7\\. What we call the Great person is the year, which causes some beings to\nfall together, and causes others to grow up. Its essence is yonder sun.\n\n8\\. One should know that the incorporeal conscious self and yonder sun are\nboth one and the same. Therefore the sun appears to every man singly (and\ndifferently).\n\n9\\. This has also been declared by a _Ri_ shi (Rv. I, 115, 1):--\n\n10\\. 'The bright face of the gods arose, the eye of Mitra, Varu _n_ a, and\nAgni; it filled heaven and earth\n\np. 260\n\nand the sky,--the sun is the self of all that rests and moves.'\n\n11\\. 'This I think to be the regular Sa _m_ hita as conceived by me,' thus\nsaid Badhva.\n\n12\\. For the Bahv _ri_ _k_ as consider him (the self) in the great hymn (mahad\nuktha), the Adhvaryus in the sacrificial fire, the _Kh_ andogas in the\nMahavrata ceremony. Him they see in this earth, in heaven, in the air, in the\nether, in the water, in herbs, in trees, in the moon, in the stars, in all\nbeings. Him alone they call Brahman.\n\n13\\. That self which consists of sight, hearing, metre, mind, and speech is\nlike unto the year.\n\n14\\. He who recites to another that self which consists of sight, hearing,\nmetre, mind, and speech, and is like unto the year,\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[259:1](sbe01235.htm#fr_661) Instead of Badhya, the commentary and the Kashmir\nMS. read Badhva.\n\n[259:2](sbe01235.htm#fr_662) Hira _n_ yagarbha, with whom he who knows the\nVeda becomes identified.
