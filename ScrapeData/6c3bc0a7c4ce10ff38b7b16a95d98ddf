He then prepares the Praya _n_ iya 2 (opening sacrifice). With the\nHavishk _ri_ t of that (oblation) he releases (the Sacrificer's) speech 3.\nHaving released his speech, he throws away the grass-bush (stambaya _g_ us 4).\nHaving thrown away the grass-bush, and drawn the first line of enclosure 5,\nand the lines (across the maha-vedi), he says, 'Throw thrice!' and the\n\xc3\x82gnidhra throws thrice (the wooden sword) 6.[](errata.htm#15)\n\n7:2:2:22\\. Having returned (to the offering, or hall-door\n\np. 326\n\nfire) he proceeds with the opening sacrifice. Having performed the opening\nsacrifice, he yokes a plough. For the gods at that time, being about to heal\nhim (Agni-Pra _g_ apati), first supplied him with food, and in like manner\ndoes this (Sacrificer) now that he is about to heal him, first supply him with\nfood. It (the food) is the plough (sira), for 'sira' is the same as 'sera 1:'\nhe thus puts food into him.\n\n7:2:2:33\\. It is made of udumbara (ficus glomerata) wood,--the Udumbara tree\nbeing sustenance, life-sap: he thus supplies him with sustenance, with life-\nsap. The cordage of the plough consists of mu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ a grass, triply twisted:\nthe significance of this has been explained.\n\n7:2:2:44\\. Standing behind the right (southern) hip of Agni (the site of the\nfire-altar) he (the Pratiprasthat _ri_ ) addresses it (the plough) while being\nyoked (by the Adhvaryu) in front of the left (northern) shoulder, with (Va\n_g_. S. XII, 67, 68; _Ri_ k S. X, 101, 4, 3), 'The skilful yoke 2 the ploughs,\nand stretch across the yokes,'--the skilful are those who know, and they do\nyoke the plough and stretch the yokes across;--'the wise, with mind devoted to\nthe gods,'--devotion means sacrifice: thus, 'the wise, performing sacrifice to\nthe gods.'\n\n7:2:2:55\\. 'Yoke ye the ploughs, and stretch across the yokes!'--they indeed\nyoke the plough, and stretch the yokes across;--'into the ready womb here cast\nye the seed!' it is for the seed that that womb, the furrow, is made; and if\none casts\n\np. 327\n\n[paragraph continues] (seed) into unploughed (ground), it is just as if one\nwere to shed seed elsewhere than into the womb. 'And plentiful yield 1 be\nthere through our song!'--the song is speech, and yield means food;--'and let\nthe ripe crop go anigh the sickle!' for when food gets ripe, people approach\nit with the sickle. With two (verses) he yokes, a Gayatri and a Trish _t_ ubh\none: the significance of this has been explained.\n\n7:2:2:66\\. He yokes the right (ox) first, then the left one: thus it is (done)\nwith the gods, differently in human (practice). It is a team of six oxen, or\none of twelve oxen, or one of twenty-four oxen: it is the year (he obtains) as\nthe consummation.\n\n7:2:2:77\\. He then ploughs through it,--ploughing means food; and the gods at\nthat time when they were about to heal him (Agni-Pra _g_ apati) first put food\ninto him; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now when he is about to\nheal him, first put food into him.\n\n7:2:2:88\\. Only the body (of the altar-site) he ploughs through, not the wings\nand tail: he thus puts food into the body. And, indeed, the food which is put\ninto the body benefits the body as well as the wings and tail; but that which\n(is put) into the wings and tail does not benefit either the body or the wings\nand tail.\n\n7:2:2:99\\. On the right (south) side of the fire-altar, he ploughs first a\nfurrow eastwards 2 inside the enclosing-stones, with (Var. S. XII, 69; _Ri_ k\nS. IV, 57, 8), 'Right luckily may the plough-shares plough up the ground,\nluckily the tillers ply with their\n\np. 328\n\noxen!'--'luckily--luckily,' he says, 'for what is successful that is lucky:'\nhe thus makes it (the furrow) successful.\n\n7:2:2:1010\\. Then on the hindpart (he ploughs a furrow) northwards 1, with (Va\n_g_. S. XII, 70), 'With sweet ghee let the furrow be saturated,'--as the text\nso its meaning;--'approved of by the All-gods, by the Maruts!' for both the\nAll-gods and the Maruts have power over the rain;--'sapful, and teeming with\nmilk,'--milk means life-sap: thus, 'teeming with life-sap and food;'--'with\nmilk, O furrow, turn thou unto us!' that is, 'with life-sap, O furrow, turn\nthou unto us!'\n\n7:2:2:1111\\. Then on the left (north) side (he ploughs a furrow) eastwards 2,\nwith (Va _g_. S. XII, 71), 'The share-shod 3 plough,'--that is, 'the plough\nabounding in wealth,'--'propitious, offering prospect for the Soma-cup 4'--for\nSoma is food;--'it throweth up the cow, the sheep, the lusty wife, the swift-\nwheeled\n\np. 329\n\nwaggon,' for all this the furrow throws up (yields).\n\n7:2:2:1212\\. Then on the forepart he ploughs a furrow) southwards 1, with (Va\n_g_. S. XII, 72), 'Milk out, O cow of plenty, their desire to Mitra, and to\nVaru _n_ a, to Indra, to the A _s_ vins, to Pushan, to creatures and plants!'\nhusbandry is (beneficial) to all deities: thus, 'Milk out for these deities\nall their desires!'--He first ploughs thus (south-west to southeast), then\nthus (south-west to north-west), then thus (north-west to north-east), then\nthus (north-east to south-east): that is (sunwise), for thus it is with the\ngods 2.\n\n7:2:2:1313\\. Four furrows he ploughs with prayer: he thereby puts into him\n(Pra _g_ apati-Agni) what food there is in the four quarters; and that with\nprayer,--true is the prayer, and true (manifest) are those quarters.\n\np. 330\n\n7:2:2:1414\\. He then ploughs (again) through the body: he thereby puts into\nhim what food there is in the year. Silently (he does so), for what is silent\nis undetermined, and the undetermined is everything: by means of everything he\nthus puts food into him. He first ploughs thus (through the middle from south\nto north), then thus (south-west to north-east), then thus (east to west),\nthen thus (north-west to south-east),--that is sunwise 1, for thus it is with\nthe gods.\n\n7:2:2:1515\\. Three furrows he ploughs each time,--threefold is Agni: as great\nas Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus puts food into\nhim.\n\n7:2:2:1616\\. Twelve furrows he ploughs silently,--the year (consists of)\ntwelve months, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his\nmeasure, by so much he thus puts food into him.\n\n7:2:2:1717\\. Both kinds (of furrows) amount to sixteen,--of sixteen parts Pra\n_g_ apati consists, and Pra _g_ apati is Agni: he thus puts into him food\nproportionate to his body. And, indeed, the food which is proportionate to the\nbody, satisfies, and does no harm; but that which is too much, does harm, and\nthat which is too little, does not satisfy.\n\np. 331\n\n7:2:2:1818\\. And, again, why he ploughs through him,--the gods being about to\nput him (Pra _g_ apati) together, thereby in the first place put the vital\nairs into him; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), being about to put\nhim together, thereby in the first place put the vital airs into him. They\n(the furrows) are lines, for these vital airs (move) in lines (channels).\n\n7:2:2:1919\\. Four furrows he ploughs with prayer: he thereby puts into him\nthose four well-defined vital airs which are in the head; and this (he does)\nwith prayer,--true is the prayer, and true (manifest, real) are these vital\nairs in the head.\n\n7:2:2:2020\\. And as to why he ploughs through the body: he thereby puts into\nhim those vital airs which are inside the body. Silently (he does so), for who\nknows how many vital airs there are inside the body?\n\n7:2:2:2121\\. Having gained the object for which he yokes those (oxen), he now\nunyokes them, with (Va _g_. S. XII, 73), 'Be ye unyoked, ye inviolable\n(oxen)!' for inviolable 1 they indeed are with the gods;--'Ye god ward-\nstriding!' for with them he performs the divine work;--'We have come to the\nend of this gloom;'--gloom doubtless means famine: thus, 'we have come to the\nend of this famine;'--'we have attained the light!' for he who attains the\ngods, the sacrifice, indeed attains the light. He then lets them loose towards\nnorth-east--the significance of this has been explained 2. He gives them to\nthe Adhvaryu, for it is he that does the work with them: let him assign them\n(to him) at the time of (the presentation of) the Dakshi _n_ as.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[325:2](sbe4158.htm#fr_617) See part ii, p. 47 seq.\n\n[325:3](sbe4158.htm#fr_618) Viz. by calling out three times 'Havishk _ri_ t,\ncome hither,' whereby the Adhvaryu summons one of the priests, or\nmaidservants, to assist in preparing the material for offering. See part i, p.\n27 seq.\n\n[325:4](sbe4158.htm#fr_619) Part i, p. 55 seq.\n\n[325:5](sbe4158.htm#fr_620) Part i, p. 59 seq.\n\n[325:6](sbe4158.htm#fr_621) See part i, p. 55. It must, however, be borne in\nmind that the passage here referred to relates to the construction of the Vedi\nof an ordinary ish _t_ i, whilst in the present instance we have to do with a\nMahavedi, as prescribed for Soma-sacrifices (cf. part ii, p. 111 seq., where,\nhowever, only a few distinctive points are adverted to). The plan of the\nMahavedi, given at the end of part ii, shows at the eastern end a square\nmound, the so-called uttara-vedi, or higher, upper altar, on which the\n\xc3\x82havaniya, or offering, fire is maintained. On a similar earth mound, but\nraised in the centre of the square site (see [VII, 3, 1,\n27](sbe4161.htm#7:3:1:27)), the Agni _k_ ayana requires the erection of the\nlarge brick fire-altar, the preparation of the site of which is explained from\nthe next paragraph.\n\n[326:1](sbe4158.htm#fr_622) That is 'sa + ira,' with draught or food.\n\n[326:2](sbe4158.htm#fr_623) Or rather, put (the oxen) to the ploughs.\nProfessor Ludwig takes 'sira' in the sense of 'straps, traces,'--the skilful\nfasten the traces.\n\n[327:1](sbe4158.htm#fr_624) Or, concession (Erhorung).\n\n[327:2](sbe4158.htm#fr_625) That is, from the right thigh to the right\nshoulder (south-west to south-east).\n\n[328:1](sbe4158.htm#fr_626) That is, from the right thigh to the left thigh\n(south-west to north-west). Whilst the first furrow was ploughed from the\nsouthwest to the south-east corner, the present and two following furrows are\nploughed 'sunwise' from south-west to north-west, north-west to north-east,\nand north-east to south-east respectively. We are not told in what manner the\nplough is to be got back from the southeast to the south-west corner after the\nploughing of the first furrow, whether it is to be carried there, or to be\npulled back outside the enclosed square.\n\n[328:2](sbe4158.htm#fr_627) That is, from the left thigh to the left shoulder\n(north-west to north-east).\n\n[328:3](sbe4158.htm#fr_628) Or, the metal-shod. The author's reason for\ninterpreting 'paviravat' by 'rayimat' is not clear.\n\n[328:4](sbe4158.htm#fr_629) According to the St. Petersburg dictionary,\n'somapitsaru' is probably a corrupt form, like the various readings\n'somasatsaru' (Ath. S. III, 17, 3) and 'sumatitsaru' (Taitt. S. IV, 2, 5, 6 =\n'moving up and down,' Saya _n_ a). Cf. Vasish _th_ a Dharma _s_ astra\n(Buhler's translation, Sacred Books of the East, vol. xiv, p. 13), where\n'somapitsaru' p. 329 is explained in the text as meaning 'provided with a\nhandle (tsaru) for the Soma-drinker' (somapi). Also Indische Studien, XVII, p.\n259, where Professor Weber proposes to divide the word 'somasatsaru' into\n'soma(n),' with thongs, and 'sa-tsaru,' with handle. If 'somapi-tsaru' really\nrepresent the constituent elements, 'tsaru,' handle, may indeed be intended as\nhaving special reference to the handle of the Soma-cup ( _k_ amasa); though\n'somapi' could only be taken in the sense of 'Soma-drinker,' and not in that\nof 'Soma-cup,' optionally suggested by Mahidhara.\n\n[329:1](sbe4158.htm#fr_630) That is, from the left to the right shoulder\n(north-east to southeast).\n\n[329:2](sbe4158.htm#fr_631) Or, perhaps, thus it goes to the gods; this tends\ngodward. Whilst the last three furrows are indeed ploughed 'sunwise' (east to\nsouth, &c.), the first furrow was ploughed in the opposite direction (south-\nwest to south-east). The reason for this is that the whole performance is to\ntake place in an easterly direction, so as to tend towards the gods. Were he\nto start at the south-east corner, and then plough right round, he would be\nmoving away from the gods, who are supposed to reside in the east.\n\n[330:1](sbe4158.htm#fr_632) Here, again, the sunwise motion of the plough only\napplies to the three last furrows (or sets of furrows), which always move from\nleft to right,--south-west to north-east, east to west, northwest to south-\neast. The first set of furrows--drawn from south to north, or along the\n'cross-spine' (as distinguished from the real, or easterly spine running from\nwest to east)--are apparently drawn in this way, in order to avoid the\nsoutherly direction, as that would imply speedy death to the Sacrificer,--his\ngoing to the Fathers, or deceased ancestors, who are supposed to reside in the\nsouth. In drawing the furrows in the way they do, the priests not only avoid\nthat region, but at the very outset move away from it, and thereby assure long\nlife to the Sacrificer.\n\n[331:1](sbe4158.htm#fr_633) See part ii, p. 216, note 2, where 'aghnya' was\nused of cows.\n\n[331:2](sbe4158.htm#fr_634) See [VI, 4, 4, 22](sbe4140.htm#6:4:4:22). The\nplough is put aside on the utkara (heap of rubbish).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII, 2, 3. Third Brahma _n_ a](sbe4159.htm)\n\n"
