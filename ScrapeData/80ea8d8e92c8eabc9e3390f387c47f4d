D. Barnett, [1911], at sacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\n\xc2\xa7 9\\. Origin of Universe from Brahma.--I. _Upanishads._ --The Upanishads,\nbeing the work of Brahmans, are naturally influenced to a great extent by the\nnaturalism of Vedic myth, especially in their conception of the origination of\nthe universe from Brahma. As we saw (\xc2\xa7 4), the Veda already speaks of a primal\nBeing that created a phenomenal world from itself and became its indwelling\nsoul; and thus, by its empiric distinction between the first Being as cause\nand the world as its effect, the Veda has arrived at a pantheistic standpoint.\n\nFrom this the Upanishadic authors started, and struggled slowly towards the\nstrictly idealistic position from which the universe, organic and inorganic,\nsubjects and objects, is regarded as a single Idea which is the same as the\nIdea of the\n\np. 21\n\nindividual subject of thought. In this progress they still made frequent use\nof the Vedic ideas and the mythical forms embodying them; they admitted their\ndistinction of Brahma as cause and the world as effect, but admitted it as a\nmode of empiric thought of merely relative validity, while from the standpoint\nof transcendental reality they asserted the identity of the two.\n\nBrahma (\xc4\x80tm\xc4\x81), causing the hitherto unconditioned universe to become\nconditioned as Name and Form (the elements of cogitable being), entered into\nit "up to the nail-tips" as immanent soul, B.A. I. iv. 7; cf. Ch. VI. ii. 3,\niii. 3, Ait. I. i. 11 f., Taitt. II. 6. Brahma is wholly present as its soul\nin every living thing, B.A. II. i. 16, iv., III. iv., v., Ch. VI. viii.-xvi.\nThe Cosmic Soul, Hira\xe1\xb9\x87ya-garbha or Brahm\xc4\x81 (masculine), enters into creation as\nfirstborn of Brahma (neuter), or highest manifestation, B.A. II. v. ("the\nbrilliant immortal Male," _Purusha_ ), Ait. III. iii. (Brahma-\xc4\x80tm\xc4\x81 is\nintelligence), Kau. I. Brahma is Cosmic Soul, universal subject of thought\nfrom which arise the principles of finite thought ( _mah \xc4\x81n \xc4\x81tm\xc4\x81,_ Ka\xe1\xb9\xadh. III.\n10, _mah \xc4\x81n purusha\xe1\xb8\xa5,_ \xc5\x9avet. III. 19). The world is created from and by Brahma\nas the web from the spider, sparks from fire, B.A. II. i. 20, \xc5\x9avet. VI. 10,\nMu\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8d. I. i. 7, II. i. 1. Brahma is "the Eternal cloaked by (empirical)\nreality," B.A. I. vi. 3, cf. I. iv. 7, II. iv. 12, v. 18, etc., Ch. III. xiv.\n1, IV. iv.-ix., VI. xiii., etc. The\n\np. 22\n\nindividual soul, according to the Upanishads, does not exist previous to the\ncreation by Brahma.\n\nThe universe is created from water, B.A. I. v. 13, Ch. VII. x. 1, Ait. I. 1.\nThree elements, B.A. I. ii. 2, Ch. VI. ii. (heat, water, and food,\nsuccessively created one from the other, after which each was blended with\npart of the others). Five elements (adding ether and wind), Taitt. II. i.,\nPra. IV. 8.\n\nII. _Later Ved \xc4\x81nta._--\xc5\x9aankara (on Brahma-s\xc5\xabtra, II. iii. 1 f.) endeavours to\nreconcile the discrepant cosmogonic theories of Ch. VI. ii. and Taitt.II. i.,\nby laying down that from the Self arises ether, thence wind, thence fire,\nthence water, thence earth, and that this process is reversed on the\ndissolution of the universe. With this qualification he follows the Ch. in its\nderivation of inorganic nature from heat (fire), water, and food (earth).\nThese he regards as primitive subtle elements, which by being mixed together\nform the gross elements; a gross element is produced by the predominance of\nthe corresponding subtle element in admixture with the other two. For his\nmetaphysical explanation of creation, see \xc2\xa7 12.\n\n\xc5\x9aankara does not mention the theory of quintuplication _(panch \xc4\xabkara\xe1\xb9\x87a_)\nadopted by the later Ved\xc4\x81nta. This doctrine assumes that there are five\nelements--ether, air, fire, water, earth--in both subtle and gross forms; in\norder that a particular gross element, e.g. water, may arise,\n\np. 23\n\nit is necessary that a proportion of one-half of the corresponding subtle form\nof water be mixed with a proportion of one-half of the half of the other four\nsubtle elements. These five elements, according to the same theory, arise from\nthe union of the Cosmic Self or _\xc4\xaa \xc5\x9bvara_ with cosmic ignorance, in the order\nabove mentioned (see further below, \xc2\xa7 12).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Brahma is Absolute Being](brk13.htm)\n\n'
