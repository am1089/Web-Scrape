There came a glad reply  \nFrom priest and mighty saint and all  \nThe councillors who thronged the hall.  \nThen cried the king with joyous heart:  \n'To-morrow let us all depart.'  \n\nThat night the envoys entertained  \nWith honour and all care remained.  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXIX.: Das'aratha's Visit.](ry069.htm)\n\n"
