Fate  \nHas brought you now my maw to sate.'  \n   When Lakshman heard, a while appalled,  \nHis ancient courage he recalled,  \nAnd to his brother by his side  \nWith seasonable counsel cried :  \n   'This vilest of the giant race  \nWill draw us to his side apace.  \nCome, rouse thee; let the vengeful sword  \nSmite off his arms, my honoured lord.  \nThis awful giant, vast of size,  \nOn his huge strength of arm relies,  \nAnd o'er the world victorious, thus  \nWith mighty force would slaughter us,  \nBut in cold blood to slay, O King.  \nDiscredit on the brave would bring,  \nAs when some victim in the rite  \nShuns not the hand up raised to smite.'  \n   The monstrous fiend, to anger stirred,  \n\nThe converse of the brothers heard.  \nHis horrid mouth he opened wide  \nAnd drew the princes to his side.  \nThey, skilled due time and place to note  \nUnsheathed their glittering sword and smote,  \nTill fiom the giant's shoulders they  \nHad hewn the mighty arms away.  \nHis trenchant falchion Rama plied  \nAnd smote him on the better side,  \nWhile valiant Lakshman on the left  \nThe arm that held him prisoned cleft,  \nThen to the earth dismembered fell  \nThe monster with a hideous yell,  \nAnd like a cloud's his deep roar went  \nThrough earth and air and firmament.  \nThen as the giant's blood flowed fast,  \nOn his cleft limbs his eye he cast,  \nAnd called upon the princely pair  \nTheir names and lineage to declare.  \nHim then the noble Lakshman, blest  \nWith fortune's favouring marks, addressed,  \nAnd told the fiend his brother's name  \nAnd the high blood of which he came:  \n'Ikshvaku's heir here Rama stands,  \nIllustrious through a hundred lands.  \nI, younger brother of the heir,  \nO fiend, the name of Lakshman bear.  \nHis mother stole his realm away  \nAnd drove him forth in woods to stray.  \nThus through the mighty forest he  \nRoamed with his royal wife and me.  \nWhile glorious as a God he made  \nHis dwelling in the greenwood shade,  \nSome giant stole away his dame,  \nAnd seeking her we hither came.  \nBut tell me who thou art, and why  \nWith headless trunk that towered so high.  \nWith flaming face beneath thy chest,  \nThou liest crushed in wild unrest.'  \n   He heard the words that Lakshman spoke,  \nAnd memory in his breast awoke,  \nRecalling Indra's words to mind  \nHe spoke in gentle tones and kind:  \n'O welcome best of men, are ye  \nWhom, blest by fate, this day I see.  \nA blessing on each trenchant blade  \nThat low on earth these arms has laid!  \nThou, lord of men, incline thine ear  \nThe story of my woe to hear,  \nWhile I the rebel pride declare  \nWhich doomed me to the form I wear.'  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXXII.: Kabandha's Tale.](ry270.htm)\n\n"
