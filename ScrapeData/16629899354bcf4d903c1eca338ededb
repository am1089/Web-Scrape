Its message is universal, sublime,\nand non-sectarian although it is a part of the scriptural trinity of Sanaatana\nDharma, commonly known as Hinduism. The Gita is very easy to understand in any\nlanguage for a mature mind. A repeated reading with faith will reveal all the\nsublime ideas contained in it. A few abstruse statements are interspersed here\nand there but they have no direct bearing on practical issues or the central\ntheme of Gita. The Gita deals with the most sacred metaphysical science. It\nimparts the knowledge of the Self and answers two universal questions: Who am\nI, and how can I lead a happy and peaceful life in this world of dualities. It\nis a book of yoga, the moral and spiritual growth, for mankind based on the\ncardinal principles of Hindu religion.\n\nThe message of Gita came to humanity because of Arjuna\xc2\x92s unwillingness to do\nhis duty as a warrior, because fighting involved destruction and killing.\nNonviolence or Ahimsa is one of the most fundamental tenets of Hinduism. All\nlives, human or non-human, are sacred. This immortal discourse between the\nSupreme Lord, Krishna, and His devotee-friend, Arjuna, occurs not in a temple,\na secluded forest, or on a mountain top but on a battlefield on the eve of a\nwar and is recorded in the great epic, Mahaabhaarata. In Gita Lord Krishna\nadvises Arjuna to get up and fight. This may create a misunderstanding of the\nprinciples of Ahimsa if the background of the war of Mahaabhaarata is not kept\nin mind. Therefore, a brief historical description is in order.\n\nIn ancient times there was a king who had two sons, Dhritaraashtra and Paandu.\nThe former was born blind, therefore, Paandu inherited the kingdom. Paandu had\nfive sons. They were called the Paandavs. Dhritaraashtra had one hundred sons.\nThey were called the Kauravs. Duryodhana was the eldest of the Kauravs.\n\nAfter the death of king Paandu the Paandavs became the lawful king. Duryodhana\nwas a very jealous person. He also wanted the kingdom. The kingdom was divided\ninto two halves between the Paandavs and the Kauravs . Duryodhana was not\nsatisfied with his share of the kingdom. He wanted the entire kingdom for\nhimself. He unsuccessfully planned several foul plays to kill the Paandavs and\ntake away their kingdom. He unlawfully took possession of the entire kingdom\nof the Paandavs and refused to give back even an acre of land without a war.\nAll mediation by Lord Krishna and others failed. The big war of Mahaabhaarata\nwas thus inevitable. The Paandavs were unwilling participants. They had only\ntwo choices: Fight for their right as a matter of duty or run away from war\nand accept defeat in the name of peace and nonviolence. Arjuna, one of the\nfive Paandava brothers, faced the dilemma in the battlefield whether to fight\nor run away from war for the sake of peace.\n\nArjuna\xc2\x92s dilemma is, in reality, the universal dilemma. Every human being\nfaces dilemmas, big and small, in their everyday life when performing their\nduties. Arjuna\xc2\x92s dilemma was the biggest of all. He had to make a choice\nbetween fighting the war and killing his most revered guru, very dear friends,\nclose relatives, and many innocent warriors or running away from the\nbattlefield for the sake of preserving the peace and nonviolence. The entire\nseven hundred verses of the Gita is a discourse between Lord Krishna and the\nconfused Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra near New Delhi, India, in\nabout 3,100 years BCE. This discourse was narrated to the blind king,\nDhritaraashtr, by his charioteer, Sanjaya, as an eyewitness war report.\n\nThe main objective of the Gita is to help people \xc2\xbe struggling in the darkness\nof ignorance \xc2\xbe cross the ocean of transmigration and reach the spiritual shore\nof liberation while living and working in the society. The central teaching of\nthe Gita is the attainment of freedom or happiness from the bondage of life by\ndoing one\xc2\x92s duty. Always remember the glory and greatness of the creator and\ndo your duty efficiently without being attached to or affected by the results\neven if that duty may at times demand unavoidable violence. Some people\nneglect or give up their duty in life for the sake of a spiritual life while\nothers excuse themselves from spiritual practices because they believe that\nthey have no time. The Lord\xc2\x92s message is to sanctify the entire living process\nitself. Whatever a person does or thinks ought to be done for the glory and\nsatisfaction of the Maker. No effort or cost is necessary for this process. Do\nyour duty as a service to the Lord and humanity and see God alone in\neverything in a spiritual frame of mind. In order to gain such a spiritual\nframe of mind, personal discipline, austerity, penance, good conduct, selfless\nservice, yogic practices, meditation, worship, prayer, rituals, and study of\nscriptures, as well as the company of holy persons, pilgrimage, chanting of\nthe holy names of God, and Self-inquiry are needed to purify the body, mind,\nand intellect. One must learn to give up lust, anger, greed, and establish\nmastery over the six senses (hearing, touch, sight, taste, smell, and mind) by\nthe purified intellect. One should always remember that all works are done by\nthe energy of nature and that he or she is not the doer but only an\ninstrument. One must strive for excellence in all undertakings but maintain\nequanimity in success and failure, gain and loss, and pain and pleasure.\n\nThe ignorance of metaphysical knowledge is humanity\xc2\x92s greatest predicament. A\nscripture, being the voice of transcendence, cannot be translated. Language is\nincapable and translations are defective to clearly impart the knowledge of\nthe Absolute. In this rendering, an attempt has been made to keep the style as\nclose as possible to the original Sanskrit poetry and yet make it easy to read\nand understand. An attempt has been made to improve the clarity by adding\nwords or phrases, within parenthesis, in the English translation of the\nverses. A glossary and index have been included. One hundred and thirty-three\n(133) key verses are printed in **red** for the convenience of beginners. We\nsuggest all our readers to ponder, contemplate, and act upon these **red** key\nverses. The beginners and the busy executives should first read and understand\nthe meaning of these key verses before delving deep into the bottomless ocean\nof transcendental knowledge of the Gita.\n\nAccording to the scriptures no sin, however heinous, can affect the one who\nreads, ponders, and practices the teachings of Gita any more than water\naffects the lotus leaf. The Lord Himself resides where Gita is kept, read,\nchanted, or taught. The Gita is the knowledge Supreme and the sound embodiment\nof the Absolute and the Eternal. The one who reads, ponders, and practices the\nteachings of Gita with faith and devotion will attain Moksha (or Nirvana) by\nthe grace of God.\n\nThis book is dedicated to my Sadguru, His Holiness Swami Chidanandji (Muniji)\nMaharaj and all other gurus whose blessings, grace, and teachings have been\ninvaluable. It is offered to the greatest guru, Lord Krishna, with love and\ndevotion. May the Lord accept it, and bless those who repeatedly read this\nwith peace, happiness, and the true knowledge of the Self.\n\n**CHAPTER 1**\n\n**ARJUNA\xc2\x92S DILEMMA**\n\n_ The war of Mahabharata has begun after all negotiations by Lord Krishna and\nothers to avoid it failed. The blind King (Dhritarashtra) was never very sure\nabout the victory of his sons (Kauravas) in spite of their superior army. Sage\nVyasa, the author of Mahabharata, wanted to give the blind king the boon of\neyesight so that the king could see the horrors of the war for which he was\nprimarily responsible. But the king refused the offer. He did not want to see\nthe horrors of the war; but preferred to get the war report through his\ncharioteer, Sanjaya. Sage Vyasa granted the power of clairvoyance to Sanjaya.\nWith this power Sanjaya could see, hear, and recall the events of the past,\npresent, and the future. He was able to give an instant replay of the eye\nwitness war report to the blind King sitting in the palace. _\n\n_ Bhishma, the mightiest man and the commander-in-chief of the Kaurava\xc2\x92s army,\nis disabled by Arjuna and is lying on deathbed in the battleground on the\ntenth day of the eighteen day war. Upon hearing this bad news from Sanjaya,\nthe blind King looses all hopes for victory of his sons. Now the King wants to\nknow the details of the war from the beginning, including how the mightiest\nman, and the commander-in-chief of his superior army \xc2\xbe who had a boon of dying\nat his own will \xc2\xbe was defeated in the battlefield. The teaching of the Gita\nbegins with the inquiry of the blind King, after Sanjaya described how Bhishma\nwas defeated, as follows:_\n\nThe King inquired: Sanjaya, please now tell me, in details, what did my people\n(the Kauravas) and the Pandavas do in the battlefield before the war started?\n(1.01)\n\nSanjaya said: O King, After seeing the battle formation of the Pandava\xc2\x92s army,\nyour son approached his guru and spoke these words: (1.02)\n\nO Master, behold this mighty army of the Pandavas, arranged in battle\nformation by your other talented disciple! There are many great warriors,\nvaliant men, heroes, and mighty archers. (1.03-06)\n\n**_Introduction Of The Army Commanders_**\n\nAlso there are many heroes on my side who have risked their lives for me. I\nshall name few distinguished commanders of my army for your information. He\nnamed all the officers of his army, and said: They are armed with various\nweapons, and are skilled in warfare. (1.07-09)\n\nOur army is invincible, while their army is easy to conquer. Therefore all of\nyou, occupying your respective positions, protect our commander-in-chief.\n(1.10-11)\n\n**_War Starts With The Blowing Of Conch Shells_**\n\nThe mighty commander-in-chief and the eldest man of the dynasty, roared as a\nlion and blew his conch loudly, bringing joy to your son. (1.12)\n\nSoon after that; conches, kettledrums, cymbals, drums, and trumpets were\nsounded together. The commotion was tremendous. (1.13)\n\nAfter that, Lord Krishna and Arjuna, seated in a grand chariot yoked with\nwhite horses, blew their celestial conches. (1.14)\n\nKrishna blew His conch first, and then Arjuna and all other commanders of\nvarious divisions of the army of Pandavas blew their respective conches. The\ntumultuous uproar, resounding through the earth and sky, tore the hearts of\nyour sons. (1.15-19)\n\n**_Arjuna Wants To Inspect The Army Against Whom He Is About To Fight_**\n\nSeeing your sons standing, and the war about to begin with the hurling of\nweapons; Arjuna, whose banner bore the emblem of Lord Hanumana, took up his\nbow and spoke these words to Lord Krishna: O Lord, please stop my chariot\nbetween the two armies until I behold those who stand here eager for the\nbattle and with whom I must engage in this act of war. (1.20-22)\n\nI wish to see those who are willing to serve and appease the evil-minded\nKauravas by assembling here to fight the battle. (1.23)\n\nSanjaya said: O King; Lord Krishna, as requested by Arjuna, placed the best of\nall the chariots in the midst of the two armies facing Arjuna\'s grandfather,\nhis guru and all other Kings; and said to Arjuna: Behold these assembled\nsoldiers! (1.24-25)\n\nArjuna saw his uncles, grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers,\nsons, grandsons, and other comrades in the army. (1.26)\n\n**_ARJUNA\'S DILEMMA_**\n\nAfter seeing fathers-in-law, companions, and all his kinsmen standing in the\nranks of the two armies, Arjuna was overcome with great compassion and\nsorrowfully spoke these words: O Krishna, seeing my kinsmen standing with a\ndesire to fight, my limbs fail and my mouth becomes dry. My body quivers and\nmy hairs stand on end. (1.27-29)\n\nThe bow slips from my hand, and my skin intensely burns. My head turns, I am\nunable to stand steady, and O Krishna, I see bad omens. I see no use of\nkilling my kinsmen in battle. (1.30-31)\n\nI desire neither victory, nor pleasure nor kingdom, O Krishna. What is the use\nof the kingdom, or enjoyment, or even life, O Krishna? Because all those \xc2\xbe for\nwhom we desire kingdom, enjoyments, and pleasures \xc2\xbe are standing here for the\nbattle, giving up their lives. (1.32-33)\n\nI do not wish to kill my teachers, uncles, sons, grandfathers, maternal\nuncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law, and other relatives who\nare about to kill us, even for the sovereignty of the three worlds, let alone\nfor this earthly kingdom, O Krishna. (1.34-35)\n\nO Lord Krishna, what pleasure shall we find in killing our cousin brothers?\nUpon killing these felons we shall incur sin only. (1.36)\n\nTherefore, we should not kill our cousin brothers. How can we be happy after\nkilling our relatives, O Krishna? (1.37)\n\nThough they are blinded by greed, and do not see evil in the destruction of\nthe family, or sin in being treacherous to friends. Why should not we, who\nclearly see evil in the destruction of the family, think about turning away\nfrom this sin, O Krishna? (1.38-39)\n\n**_ARJUNA DESCRIBES THE EVILS OF WAR_**\n\nEternal family traditions and codes of moral conduct are destroyed with the\ndestruction of the family. And immorality prevails in the family due to the\ndestruction of family traditions. (1.40)\n\nAnd when immorality prevails, O Krishna, the women of the family become\ncorrupted; when women are corrupted, unwanted progeny is born. (1.41)\n\nThis brings the family and the slayers of the family to hell, because the\nspirits of their ancestors are degraded when deprived of ceremonial offerings\nof love and respect by the unwanted progeny. (1.42)\n\nThe everlasting qualities of social order and family traditions of those who\ndestroy their family are ruined by the sinful act of illegitimacy. (1.43)\n\nWe have been told, O Krishna, that people whose family traditions are\ndestroyed necessarily dwell in hell for a long time. (1.44)\n\nAlas! We are ready to commit a great sin by striving to slay our relatives\nbecause of greed for the pleasures of the kingdom. (1.45)\n\nIt would be far better for me if my cousin brothers kill me with their weapons\nin battle while I am unarmed and unresisting. (1.46)\n\n**_WHEN GOING GETS TOUGH, EVEN TOUGH ONES CAN GET DELUDED_**\n\nSanjaya said: Having said this in the battlefield and casting aside his bow\nand arrow, Arjuna sat down on the seat of the chariot with his mind\noverwhelmed with sorrow. (1.47)\n\n**CHAPTER 2**\n\n**TRANSCENDENTAL KNOWLEDGE**\n\nSanjaya said: Lord Krishna spoke these words to Arjuna whose eyes were tearful\nand downcast, and who was overwhelmed with compassion and despair. (2.01)\n\nLord Krishna said: How has the dejection come to you at this juncture? This is\nnot fit for a person of noble mind and deeds. It is disgraceful, and it does\nnot lead one to heaven, O Arjuna. (2.02)\n\nDo not become a coward, O Arjuna, because it does not befit you. Shake off\nthis trivial weakness of your heart and get up for the battle, O Arjuna.\n(2.03)\n\n**_ARJUNA CONTINUES HIS REASONING_**\n\n**_AGAINST THE WAR_**\n\nArjuna said: How shall I strike my grandfather, my guru, and all other\nrelatives, who are worthy of my respect, with arrows in battle, O Krishna?\n(2.04)\n\nIt would be better, indeed, to live on alms in this world than to slay these\nnoble personalities, because by killing them I would enjoy wealth and\npleasures stained with their blood. (2.05)\n\nWe do not know which alternative \xc2\xbe to fight or to quit \xc2\xbe is better for us.\nFurther, we do not know whether we shall conquer them or they will conquer us.\nWe should not even wish to live after killing our cousin brothers, who are\nstanding in front of us. (2.06)\n\nMy senses are overcome by the weakness of pity, and my mind is confused about\nduty (Dharma). Please tell me what is better for me. I am Your disciple, and I\ntake refuge in You. (2.07)\n\nI do not perceive that gaining an unrivaled and prosperous kingdom on this\nearth, or even lordship over all the celestial controllers will remove the\nsorrow that is drying up my senses. (2.08)\n\nSanjaya said: O King, after speaking like this to Lord Krishna, the mighty\nArjuna said to Krishna: I shall not fight, and became silent. (2.09)\n\nO King, Lord Krishna, as if smiling, spoke these words to the distressed\nArjuna in the midst of the two armies. (2.10)\n\n**_THE TEACHINGS OF THE GITA BEGIN WITH THE TRUE KNOWLEDGE OF SPIRIT_**\n\n**_AND THE PHYSICAL BODY_**\n\n**Lord Krishna said: You grieve for those who are not worthy of grief, and yet\nspeak words of wisdom. The wise grieves neither for the living nor for the\ndead. (2.11)**\n\nThere was never a time when these monarchs, you, or I did not exist; nor shall\nwe ever cease to exist in the future. (2.12)\n\n**Just as the soul acquires a childhood body, a youth body, and an old age\nbody during this life; similarly, the soul acquires another body after death.\nThis should not delude the wise. (See also 15.08) (2.13)**\n\nThe contacts of the senses with the sense objects give rise to the feelings of\nheat and cold, and pain and pleasure. They are transitory and impermanent.\nTherefore, one should learn to endure them. (2.14)\n\nBecause a calm person \xc2\xbe who is not afflicted by these sense objects, and is\nsteady in pain and pleasure \xc2\xbe becomes fit for salvation. (2.15)\n\n**_THE SPIRIT IS ETERNAL, BODY IS TRANSITORY_**\n\nThe invisible Spirit (Atma, Atman) is eternal, and the visible physical body,\nis transitory. The reality of these two is indeed certainly seen by the seers\nof truth. (2.16)\n\nThe Spirit by whom this entire universe is pervaded is indestructible. No one\ncan destroy the imperishable Spirit. (2.17)\n\nThe physical bodies of the eternal, immutable, and incomprehensible Spirit are\nperishable. Therefore fight, O Arjuna. (2.18)\n\n**The one who thinks that the Spirit is a slayer, and the one who thinks the\nSpirit is slain, both are ignorant. Because the Spirit neither slays nor is\nslain. (2.19)**\n\nThe Spirit is neither born nor does it die at any time. It does not come into\nbeing, or cease to exist. It is unborn, eternal, permanent, and primeval. The\nSpirit is not destroyed when the body is destroyed. (2.20)\n\nO Arjuna, how can a person who knows that the Spirit is indestructible,\neternal, unborn, and immutable, kill anyone or causes anyone to be killed?\n(2.21)\n\n**_DEATH AND TRANSMIGRATION OF SOUL_**\n\n**Just as a person puts on new garments after discarding the old ones;\nsimilarly, the living entity or the individual soul acquires new bodies after\ncasting away the old bodies. (2.22)**\n\nWeapons do not cut this Spirit, fire does not burn it, water does not make it\nwet, and the wind does not make it dry. The Spirit cannot be cut, burned,\nwetted, or dried. It is eternal, all pervading, unchanging, immovable, and\nprimeval. (2.23-24)\n\nThe Spirit is said to be unexplainable, incomprehensible, and unchanging.\nKnowing the Spirit as such you should not grieve. (2.25)\n\nEven if you think that the physical body takes birth and dies perpetually,\neven then, O Arjuna, you should not grieve like this. Because death is certain\nfor the one who is born, and birth is certain for the one who dies. Therefore,\nyou should not lament over the inevitable. (2.26-27)\n\n**All beings are unmanifest, or invisible to our physical eyes before birth\nand after death. They manifest between the birth and the death only. What is\nthere to grieve about? (2.28)**\n\n**_THE INDESTRUCTIBLE SPIRIT TRANSCENDS MIND AND SPEECH_**\n\nSome look upon this Spirit as a wonder, another describes it as wonderful, and\nothers hear of it as a wonder. Even after hearing about it very few people\nknow what the Spirit is. (See also KaU 2.07) (2.29)\n\nO Arjuna, the Spirit that dwells in the body of all beings is eternally\nindestructible. Therefore, you should not mourn for anybody. (2.30)\n\n**_LORD KRISHNA REMINDS ARJUNA OF HIS DUTY AS A WARRIOR_**\n\nConsidering also your duty as a warrior you should not waver like this.\nBecause there is nothing more auspicious for a warrior than a righteous war.\n(2.31)\n\nOnly the fortunate warriors, O Arjuna, get such an opportunity for an unsought\nwar that is like an open door to heaven. (2.32)\n\nIf you will not fight this righteous war, then you will fail in your duty,\nlose your reputation, and incur sin. (2.33)\n\nPeople will talk about your disgrace forever. To the honored, dishonor is\nworse than death. (2.34)\n\nThe great warriors will think that you have retreated from the battle out of\nfear. Those who have greatly esteemed you will lose respect for you. (2.35)\n\nYour enemies will speak many unmentionable words and scorn your ability. What\ncould be more painful to you than this? (2.36)\n\nYou will go to heaven if killed on the line of duty, or you will enjoy the\nkingdom on the earth if victorious. Therefore, get up with a determination to\nfight, O Arjuna. (2.37)\n\n**Treating pleasure and pain, gain and loss, and victory and defeat alike,\nengage yourself in your duty. By doing your duty this way you will not incur\nsin. (2.38)**\n\n**_IMPORTANCE OF KARMA-YOGA, THE SELFLESS SERVICE_**\n\nThe science of transcendental knowledge has been imparted to you, O Arjuna.\nNow listen to the science of selfless service (Seva), endowed with which you\nwill free yourself from all Karmic bondage, or sin. (2.39)\n\nNo effort is ever lost in selfless service, and there is no adverse effect.\nEven a little practice of the discipline of selfless service protects one from\nthe great fear of repeated birth and death. (2.40)\n\nA selfless worker has resolute determination for God-realization, but the\ndesires of the one who works to enjoy the fruits of work are endless. (2.41)\n\n**_THE VEDAS DEAL WITH BOTH MATERIAL AND SPIRITUAL ASPECTS OF LIFE_**\n\nThe misguided ones who delight in the melodious chanting of the Veda \xc2\xbe without\nunderstanding the real purpose of the Vedas \xc2\xbe think, O Arjuna, as if there is\nnothing else in the Vedas except the rituals for the sole purpose of obtaining\nheavenly enjoyment. (2.42)\n\nThey are dominated by material desires, and consider the attainment of heaven\nas the highest goal of life. They engage in specific rites for the sake of\nprosperity and enjoyment. Rebirth is the result of their action. (2.43)\n\nThe resolute determination of Self-realization is not formed in the minds of\nthose who are attached to pleasure and power, and whose judgment is obscured\nby ritualistic activities. (2.44)\n\nA portion of the Vedas deals with three modes \xc2\x97 goodness, passion, and\nignorance \xc2\x97 of material Nature. Become free from pairs of opposites, be ever\nbalanced and unconcerned with the thoughts of acquisition and preservation.\nRise above these three modes, and be Self-conscious, O Arjuna. (2.45)\n\nTo a Self-realized person the Vedas are as useful as a small reservoir of\nwater when the water of a huge lake becomes available. (2.46)\n\n**_THEORY AND PRACTICE OF KARMA-YOGA_**\n\n**You have control over doing your respective duty only, but no control or\nclaim over the results. The fruits of work should not be your motive, and you\nshould never be inactive. (2.47)**\n\n**Do your duty to the best of your ability, O Arjuna, with your mind attached\nto the Lord, abandoning worry and selfish attachment to the results, and\nremaining calm in both success and failure. The selfless service is a yogic\npractice that brings peace and equanimity of mind. (2.48)**\n\nWork done with selfish motives is inferior by far to the selfless service.\nTherefore be a selfless worker, O Arjuna. Those who work only to enjoy the\nfruits of their labor are verily unhappy, because one has no control over the\nresults. (2.49)\n\n**A Karma-yogi or the selfless person becomes free from both vice and virtue\nin this life itself. Therefore, strive for selfless service. Working to the\nbest of one\xc2\x92s abilities without becoming selfishly attached to the fruits of\nwork is called Karma-yoga or Seva. (2.50)**\n\nKarma-yogis are freed from the bondage of rebirth due to renouncing the\nselfish attachment to the fruits of all work, and attain blissful divine state\nof salvation or Nirvana. (2.51)\n\nWhen your intellect will completely pierce the veil of confusion, then you\nwill become indifferent to what has been heard and what is to be heard from\nthe scriptures. (2.52)\n\nWhen your intellect, that is confused by the conflicting opinions and the\nritualistic doctrine of the Vedas, shall stay steady and firm on concentration\nof the Supreme Being, then you shall attain union with the Supreme in trance.\n(2.53)\n\nArjuna said: O Krishna, what are the marks of an enlightened person whose\nintellect is steady? What does a person of steady intellect think and talk\nabout? How does such a person behave with others, and live in this world?\n(2.54)\n\n**_MARKS OF A SELF-REALIZED PERSON_**\n\nLord Krishna said: When one is completely free from all desires of the mind\nand is satisfied with the Supreme Being by the joy of Supreme Being, then one\nis called an enlightened person, O Arjuna. (2.55)\n\n**A person whose mind is unperturbed by sorrow, who does not crave pleasures,\nand who is completely free from attachment, fear, and anger, is called an\nenlightened sage of steady intellect. (2.56)**\n\nThe mind and intellect of a person become steady who is not attached to\nanything, who is neither elated by getting desired results, nor perturbed by\nundesired results. (2.57)\n\nWhen one can completely withdraw the senses from the sense objects as a\ntortoise withdraws its limbs into the shell for protection from calamity, then\nthe intellect of such a person is considered steady. (2.58)\n\nThe desire for sensual pleasures fades away if one abstains from sense\nenjoyment, but the craving for sense enjoyment remains in a very subtle form.\nThis subtle craving also completely disappears from the one who knows the\nSupreme Being. (2.59)\n\n**_DANGERS OF UNRESTRAINED SENSES_**\n\n**Restless senses, O Arjuna, forcibly carry away the mind of even a wise\nperson striving for perfection. (2.60)**\n\n**One should fix one\xc2\x92s mind on God with loving contemplation after bringing\nthe senses under control. One\xc2\x92s intellect becomes steady when one\xc2\x92s senses are\nunder complete control. (2.61)**\n\n**One develops attachment to sense objects by thinking about sense objects.\nDesire for sense objects comes from attachment to sense objects, and anger\ncomes from unfulfilled desires. (2.62)**\n\nDelusion or wild idea arises from anger. The mind is bewildered by delusion.\nReasoning is destroyed when the mind is bewildered. One falls down from the\nright path when reasoning is destroyed. (2.63)\n\n**_ATTAINMENT OF PEACE AND HAPPINESS THROUGH SENSE CONTROL AND KNOWLEDGE_**\n\nA disciplined person, enjoying sense objects with senses that are under\ncontrol and free from attachments and aversions, attains tranquillity. (2.64)\n\nAll sorrows are destroyed upon attainment of tranquillity. The intellect of\nsuch a tranquil person soon becomes completely steady and united with the\nSupreme. (2.65)\n\nThere is neither Self-knowledge, nor Self-perception to those who are not\nunited with the Supreme. Without Self-perception there is no peace, and\nwithout peace there can be no happiness. (2.66)\n\n**Because the mind, when controlled by the roving senses, steals away the\nintellect as a storm takes away a boat on the sea from its destination \xc2\xbe the\nspiritual shore of peace and happiness. (2.67)**\n\nTherefore, O Arjuna, one\xc2\x92s intellect becomes steady whose senses are\ncompletely withdrawn from the sense objects. (2.68)\n\nA yogi, the person of self-restraint, remains wakeful when it is night for all\nothers. It is night for the yogi who sees when all others are wakeful. (2.69)\n\n**One attains peace, within whose mind all desires dissipate without creating\nany mental disturbance, as river waters enter the full ocean without creating\nany disturbance. One who desires material objects is never peaceful. (2.70)**\n\nOne who abandons all desires, and becomes free from longing and the feeling of\n\'I\' and \'my\', attains peace. (2.71)\n\nO Arjuna, this is the superconscious state of mind. Attaining this state, one\nis no longer deluded. Gaining this state, even at the end of one\xc2\x92s life, a\nperson becomes one with the Absolute. (2.72).\n\n**CHAPTER 3**\n\n**PATH OF SERVICE**\n\nArjuna asked: If You consider that acquiring transcendental knowledge is\nbetter than working, then why do You want me to engage in this horrible war, O\nKrishna? You seem to confuse my mind by apparently conflicting words. Tell me,\ndecisively, one thing by which I may attain the Supreme. (3.01-02)\n\n**Lord Krishna said: In this world I have stated a twofold path of spiritual\ndiscipline in the past. The path of Self-knowledge for the contemplative ones,\nand the path of unselfish work (Seva, Karma-yoga) for all others. (3.03)**\n\nOne does not attain freedom from the bondage of Karma by merely abstaining\nfrom work. No one attains perfection by merely giving up work, because no one\ncan remain actionless even for a moment. Everyone is driven to action \xc2\xbe\nhelplessly indeed \xc2\xbe by the forces of Nature. (3.04-05)\n\nAnyone, who restrains the senses but mentally dwells upon the sense objects,\nis called a pretender. (3.06)\n\n**_WHY ONE SHOULD SERVE OTHERS?_**\n\n**The one who controls the senses by the trained and purified mind and\nintellect, and engages the organs of action to selfless service is considered\nsuperior. (3.07)**\n\nPerform your obligatory duty, because working is indeed better than sitting\nidle. Even the maintenance of your body would not be possible without work.\n(3.08)\n\n**Work other than those done as a selfless service (Seva) binds human beings.\nTherefore, becoming free from selfish attachment to the fruits of work, do\nyour duty efficiently as a service to Me. (3.09)**\n\n**_TO HELP EACH OTHER IS THE FIRST COMMANDMENT OF THE CREATOR_**\n\nIn the beginning the creator created human beings together with selfless\nservice (Seva, sacrifice) and said: By serving each other you shall prosper\nand the sacrificial service shall fulfill all your desires. (3.10)\n\nNourish the celestial controllers with selfless service, and they will nourish\nyou. Thus nourishing one another you shall attain the Supreme goal. (3.11)\n\nThe celestial controllers, served by selfless service, will give you all\ndesired objects. One who enjoys the gift of celestial controllers without\nsharing with others is, indeed, a thief. (3.12)\n\nThe righteous who eat after feeding others are freed from all sins, but the\nimpious who cook food only for themselves \xc2\xbe without first offering to God, or\nsharing with others \xc2\xbe verily eat sin. (3.13)\n\nThe living beings are born from food grains, grains are produced by\nsacrificial work or duty performed by farmers and other field workers. Duty is\nprescribed in the scriptures. Scriptures (such as the Vedas, the Holy Bible,\nthe Holy Koran) come from the Supreme Being. Thus the all-pervading Supreme\nBeing or God is ever present in selfless service. (3.14-15)\n\n**The one who does not help to keep the wheel of creation in motion by\nsacrificial duty (Seva), and rejoices sense pleasures, that sinful person\nlives in vain. (3.16)**\n\nThe one who rejoices the Supreme Being, who is delighted with the Supreme\nBeing, and who is content with the Supreme Being alone, for such a Self-\nrealized person there is no duty. Such a person has no interest, whatsoever,\nin what is done or what is not done. A Self-realized person does not depend on\nanybody, except God, for anything. (3.17-18)\n\n**_LEADERS SHOULD SET AN EXAMPLE_**\n\n**Always perform your duty efficiently and without any selfish attachment to\nthe results, because by doing work without attachment one attains Supreme.\n(3.19)**\n\n**King Janaka and others attained perfection of Self-realization by selfless\nservice (Karma-yoga) alone. You should also perform your duty with a view to\nguide people, and for the welfare of the society. (3.20)**\n\nBecause whatever noble persons do, others follow. Whatever standard they set\nup, the world follows. (3.21)\n\nO Arjuna, there is nothing in the three worlds \xc2\x97 heaven, earth, and the lower\nregions \xc2\x97 that should be done by Me, nor there is anything unobtained that I\nshould obtain, yet I engage in action. (3.22)\n\nBecause, if I do not engage in action relentlessly, O Arjuna, people would\nfollow My path in everyway. These worlds would perish if I do not work, and I\nshall be the cause of confusion and destruction of all these people. (3.23-24)\n\n**_WHAT SHOULD THE WISE DO TO_**\n\n**_THE IGNORANT_**\n\nAs the ignorant work with attachment to the fruits of work, so the wise should\nwork without attachment, for the welfare of the society. (3.25)\n\n**The wise should not unsettle the mind of the ignorant ones who are attached\nto the fruits of work, but the enlightened one should inspire others by\nperforming all works efficiently without selfish attachment. (See also 3.29)\n(3.26)**\n\n**_ALL WORKS ARE THE WORKS OF NATURE_**\n\n**The forces of Nature do all works. But due to delusion of ignorance people\nassume themselves to be the doer. (See also 5.09, 13.29, and 14.19) (3.27)**\n\nThe one who knows the truth about the role of the forces of Nature in getting\nwork done does not become attached to the work. Such a person knows that it is\nthe forces of Nature that get their work done by using our organs as their\ninstruments. (3.28)\n\nBut those who are deluded by the illusive power (Maya) of Nature become\nattached to the works done by the forces of Nature. The wise should not\ndisturb the mind of the ignorant whose knowledge is imperfect. (See also 3.26)\n(3.29)\n\n**Do your duty dedicating all works to God in a spiritual frame of mind free\nfrom desire, attachment, and mental grief. (3.30)**\n\nThose who always practice this teaching of Mine \xc2\xbe with faith and are free from\ncavil \xc2\xbe become free from the bondage of Karma. But those who carp at this\nteaching and do not practice it, consider them ignorant, senseless, and lost.\n(3.31-32)\n\nAll beings follow their nature. Even the wise act according to their own\nnature. What, then, is the value of sense restraint? (3.33)\n\n**_TWO MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCKS ON THE PATH OF PERFECTION_**\n\n**Attachments and aversions for the sense objects remain in the senses. One\nshould not come under the control of these two, because they are two major\nstumbling blocks, indeed, on one\xc2\x92s path of Self-realization. (3.34)**\n\nOne\xc2\x92s inferior natural work is better than superior unnatural work. Death in\ncarrying out one\xc2\x92s natural work is useful. Unnatural work produces too much\nstress. (See also 18.47) (3.35)\n\n**_LUST IS THE ORIGIN OF SIN_**\n\nArjuna said: O Krishna, what impels one to commit sin as if unwillingly and\nforced against one\xc2\x92s will? (3.36)\n\n**Lord Krishna said: It is the lust born out of passion that becomes anger\nwhen unfulfilled. Lust is insatiable and is a great devil. Know this as the\nenemy. (3.37)**\n\n**As the fire is covered by smoke, as a mirror by dust, and as an embryo by\nthe amnion; similarly, Self-knowledge gets covered by different degrees of\nthis insatiable lust, the eternal enemy of the wise. (3.38-39)**\n\n**The senses, the mind, and the intellect are said to be the abode of lust;\nwith these it deludes a person by veiling the Self-knowledge. (3.40)**\n\nTherefore, O Arjuna, by controlling the senses first, kill this devil of\nmaterial desire that destroys Self-knowledge and Self-realization. (3.41)\n\n**_HOW TO CONTROL LUST_**\n\nThe senses are said to be superior to the body, the mind is superior to the\nsenses, the intellect is superior to the mind, transcendental knowledge is\nsuperior to the intellect, and the Self is superior to transcendental\nknowledge. (3.42)\n\n**Thus, knowing the Self to be superior to the intellect, and controlling the\nmind by the intellect that is purified by spiritual practices, one must kill\nthis mighty enemy, lust, O Arjuna. (3.43)**\n\n**CHAPTER 4**\n\n**PATH OF RENUNCIATION WITH**\n\n**KNOWLEDGE**\n\n**_KARMA-YOGA IS AN ANCIENT FORGOTTEN COMMANDMENT_**\n\nLord Krishna said: I taught this Karma-yoga, the eternal science of right\naction, to King Vivasvan. Vivasvan taught it to Manu. Manu taught it to\nIkshvaku. Thus handed down in succession the saintly Kings knew this science\nof proper action (Karma-yoga). After a long time this science was lost from\nthis earth. Today I have described the same ancient science to you, because\nyou are my sincere devotee and friend. This science is a supreme secret\nindeed. (4.01-03)\n\nArjuna said: You were born later, but Vivasvan was born in ancient time. How\nam I to understand that You taught this science in the beginning of the\ncreation? (4.04)\n\n**_THE PURPOSE OF INCARNATION OF GOD_**\n\nLord Krishna said: Both you and I have taken many births. I remember them all,\nO Arjuna, but you do not remember. (4.05)\n\nThough I am eternal, immutable, and the Lord of all beings, yet I manifest\nMyself by controlling the material Nature using My own divine potential energy\n(Maya). (See also 10.14) (4.06)\n\n**Whenever there is a decline of Dharma (Righteousness) and a predominance of\nAdharma (Unrighteousness), O Arjuna, then I manifest Myself. I appear from\ntime to time for protecting the good, for transforming the wicked, and for\nestablishing world order (Dharma). (4.07-08)**\n\nThe one who truly understands My transcendental appearance, and activities of\ncreation, maintenance, and dissolution attains My Supreme Abode and is not\nborn again after leaving this body, O Arjuna. (4.09)\n\nMany have become free from attachment, fear, anger, and attained salvation by\ntaking refuge in Me, by becoming fully absorbed in My thoughts, and by getting\npurified by the fire of Self-knowledge. (4.10)\n\n**_PATH OF WORSHIP AND PRAYER_**\n\nWith whatever motive people worship Me, I fulfill their desires accordingly.\nPeople worship Me with different motives. (4.11)\n\nThose who long for success in their work here on the earth worship the\ncelestial controllers. Success in work comes quickly in this human world.\n(4.12)\n\n**_DIVISION OF LABOR IS BASED ON THE APTITUDE OF PEOPLE_**\n\n**I created the four divisions of human society based on aptitude and\nvocation. Though I am the author of this system of the division of labor, one\nshould know that I do nothing directly and I am eternal. (See also 18.41)\n(4.13)**\n\nWorks do not bind Me, because I have no desire for the fruits of work. The one\nwho fully understands and practices this truth is also not bound by Karma.\n(4.14)\n\nThe ancient seekers of salvation also performed their duties with this\nunderstanding. Therefore, you should do your duty as the ancients did. (4.15)\n\n**_ATTACHED, DETACHED, AND FORBIDDEN ACTION_**\n\nEven the wise ones are confused about what is action and what is inaction.\nTherefore, I shall clearly explain what is action, knowing that one shall be\nliberated from the evil of birth and death. (4.16)\n\nThe true nature of action is very difficult to understand. Therefore, one\nshould know the nature of attached action, the nature of detached action, and\nalso the nature of forbidden action. (4.17)\n\n**_A KARMA-YOGI IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE KARMIC LAWS_**\n\n**The one who sees inaction in action, and action in inaction, is a wise\nperson. Such a person is a yogi and has accomplished everything. (See also\n3.05, 3.27, 5.08 and 13.29) (4.18)**\n\nA person, whose desires have become selfless by being roasted in the fire of\nSelf-knowledge, is called a sage by the wise. (4.19)\n\n**The one who has abandoned selfish attachment to the fruits of work, and\nremains ever content and dependent on no one but God, such a person \xc2\xbe though\nengaged in activity \xc2\xbe does nothing at all, and incurs no Karmic reaction.\n(4.20)**\n\nThe one who is free from desires, whose mind and senses are under control, and\nwho has renounced all proprietorship, does not incur sin \xc2\xbe the Karmic reaction\n\xc2\xbe by doing bodily action. (4.21)\n\nA Karma-yogi \xc2\xbe who is content with whatever gain comes naturally by His will,\nwho is unaffected by pairs of opposites, and free from envy, equanimous in\nsuccess and failure \xc2\xbe is not bound by Karma. (4.22)\n\nAll Karmic bonds of a Karma-yogi \xc2\xbe who is free from attachment, whose mind is\nfixed in Self-knowledge, and who does work as a service to the Lord \xc2\xbe\ndissolves away (4.23)\n\n**The Spirit shall be realized by the one who considers everything as a\nmanifestation, or an act, of the Spirit. (Also see 9.16) (4.24)**\n\n**_DIFFERENT TYPES OF SPIRITUAL PRACTICES OR SACRIFICES_**\n\nSome yogis perform the service of worship to celestial controllers, while\nothers study scriptures for Self-knowledge. Some restrain their senses and\ngive up their sensual pleasures. Others perform breathing and other yogic\nexercises. Some give charity and offer their wealth as a sacrifice. (4.25-28)\n\nThose who are engaged in yogic practices, reach the breathless state of trance\nby offering inhalation into exhalation and exhalation into inhalation as a\nsacrifice (by using short breathing Kriya techniques). (4.29)\n\nOthers restrict their diet and offer their inhalations as sacrifice into their\ninhalations. All these people are the knowers of sacrifice, and are purified\nby their sacrifice. (4.30)\n\n**Those who perform selfless service obtain the nectar of Self-knowledge as a\nresult of their sacrifice and attain the Supreme Being. O Arjuna, even this\nworld is not a happy place for the non-sacrificer, how can the other world be?\n(See also 4.38, and 5.06). (4.31)**\n\nMany types of spiritual disciplines are described in the Vedas. Know that all\nof them are the action of body, mind, and senses prompted by the forces of\nNature. Understanding this, one shall attain Nirvana or salvation. (See also\n3.14) (4.32)\n\n**_ACQUIRING TRANSCENDENTAL KNOWLEDGE IS A SUPERIOR_**\n\n**_SPIRITUAL PRACTICE_**\n\n**Acquiring transcendental knowledge is superior to any material sacrifice \xc2\xbe\nsuch as giving charity. Because, purification of mind and intellect that\neventually leads to the dawn of transcendental knowledge and Self-realization\nis the sole purpose of any spiritual action. (4.33)**\n\n**Acquire this transcendental knowledge from a Self-realized master by humble\nreverence, by sincere inquiry, and by service. The empowered ones, who have\nrealized the Truth, will teach you. (4.34)**\n\nAfter knowing the transcendental science, O Arjuna, you shall not again become\ndeluded like this. With this knowledge you shall see the entire creation\nwithin your own higher Self, and thus within Me. (See also 6.29, 6.30, 11.07,\n11.13) (4.35)\n\nEven if one is the most sinful of all sinners, one shall yet cross over the\nocean of sin by the raft of Self-knowledge alone. (4.36)\n\n**As the blazing fire reduces wood to ashes; similarly, the fire of Self-\nknowledge reduces all bonds of Karma to ashes, O Arjuna. (4.37)**\n\n**_TRANSCENDENTAL KNOWLEDGE IS AUTOMATICALLY REVEALED TO_**\n\n**_A KARMA-YOGI_**\n\n**Verily, there is no purifier in this world like the true knowledge of the\nSupreme Being. One discovers this knowledge within, naturally, in course of\ntime when one\'s mind is cleansed of selfishness by Karma-yoga. (See also 4.31,\nand 5.06, 18.78). (4.38)**\n\nThe one who has faith in God, is sincere in yogic practices, and has control\nover the mind and senses gains this transcendental knowledge. Having gained\nthis knowledge, one quickly attains supreme peace or liberation. (4.39)\n\nThe irrational, the faithless, and the disbeliever (atheist) perishes. There\nis neither this world, nor the world beyond, nor happiness for the\ndisbeliever. (4.40)\n\n**_BOTH TRANSCENDENTAL KNOWLEDGE AND KARMA-YOGA ARE NEEDED_**\n\n**_FOR NIRVANA_**\n\nWork does not bind a person who has renounced work \xc2\xbe by renouncing the fruits\nof work \xc2\xbe through Karma-yoga, and whose confusion with regard to body and\nSpirit is completely destroyed by the application of Self-knowledge, O Arjuna.\n(4.41)\n\nTherefore, cut the ignorance-born confusion with regard to body and Spirit by\nthe sword of Self-knowledge, resort to Karma-yoga, and get up for the war, O\nArjuna. (4.42)\n\n**CHAPTER 5**\n\n**PATH OF RENUNCIATION**\n\nArjuna asked: O Krishna, You praise the path of transcendental knowledge, and\nalso the path of performance of selfless service (Karma-yoga). Tell me,\ndefinitely, which one is the better of the two paths. (See also 5.05) (5.01)\n\nLord Krishna said: The path of Self-knowledge and the path of selfless service\nboth lead to the supreme goal. But, of the two, the path of selfless service\nis superior to path of Self-knowledge, because it is easier to practice.\n(5.02)\n\nA person should be considered a true renunciant who has neither attachment nor\naversion for anything. One is easily liberated from Karmic bondage by becoming\nfree from attachment and aversion. (5.03)\n\n**_BOTH PATHS LEAD TO SUPREME_**\n\n**The ignorant \xc2\x97 not the wise \xc2\x97 consider the path of Self-knowledge and the\npath of selfless service (Karma-yoga) as different from each other. The\nperson, who has truly mastered one, gets the benefits of both. (5.04)**\n\n**Whatever goal a renunciant reaches, a Karma-yogi also reaches the same goal.\nTherefore, the one who sees the path of renunciation and the path of unselfish\nwork as the same really sees. (See also 6.01 and 6.02) (5.05)**\n\n**But, true renunciation, O Arjuna, is difficult to attain without Karma-yoga.\nA sage equipped with Karma-yoga quickly attains Nirvana. (See also 4.31, and\n4.38) (5.06)**\n\nA Karma-yogi, whose mind is pure, whose mind and senses are under control, and\nwho sees one and the same Spirit in all beings, is not bound by Karma though\nengaged in work. (5.07)\n\n**_A TRANSCENDENTALIST DOES NOT CONSIDER ONESELF AS THE DOER_**\n\nThe wise who knows the truth thinks: "I do nothing at all." In seeing,\nhearing, touching, smelling, eating, walking, sleeping, breathing; and\nspeaking, giving, taking, as well as opening and closing the eyes, the wise\nbelieves that only the senses are operating upon their objects. (See also\n3.27, 13.29, and 14.19) (5.08-09)\n\n**_A KARMA-YOGI WORKS FOR GOD_**\n\n**One who does all work as an offering to God \xc2\x97 abandoning selfish attachment\nto results \xc2\x97 remains untouched by Karmic reaction or sin as a lotus leaf never\ngets wet by water. (5.10)**\n\nThe Karma-yogis perform action \xc2\xbe without selfish attachment \xc2\xbe with their body,\nmind, intellect, and senses only for the purification of their mind and\nintellect. (5.11)\n\n**A Karma-yogi attains Supreme Bliss by abandoning attachment to the fruits of\nwork; while others, who are attached to the fruits of work, become bound by\nselfish work. (5.12)**\n\n**_THE PATH OF KNOWLEDGE_**\n\nA person, who has completely renounced the fruits of all works, dwells happily\nin the City of Nine Gates, neither performing nor directing action. (5.13)\n\nThe Lord neither creates the urge for action, nor the feeling of doership, nor\nthe attachment to the results of action in people. The powers of material\nNature do all these. (5.14)\n\nThe Lord does not take the responsibility for the good or evil deeds of\nanybody. The veil of ignorance covers the Self-knowledge; thereby people\nbecome deluded and do evil deeds. (5.15)\n\nTranscendental knowledge destroys the ignorance of the Spirit and reveals the\nSupreme Being just as the sun reveals the beauty of objects of the world.\n(5.16)\n\n**Persons, whose mind and intellect are totally merged in the Supreme Being,\nwho are firmly devoted to the Supreme, who have God as their supreme goal and\nsole refuge, and whose impurities are destroyed by the knowledge of the self,\ndo not take birth again. (5.17)**\n\n**_ADDITIONAL MARKS OF AN ENLIGHTENED PERSON_**\n\n**An enlightened person \xc2\x97 by perceiving God in all \xc2\x97 looks at a learned\nperson, an outcast, even a cow, an elephant, or a dog with an equal eye. (See\nalso 6.29) (5.18)**\n\nEverything has been accomplished in this very life by the one whose mind is\nset in equality. Such a person has realized the Supreme Being, because the\nSupreme Being is flawless and impartial. (See also 18.55) (5.19)\n\nOne who neither rejoices on obtaining what is pleasant, nor grieves on\nobtaining the unpleasant, who has a steady mind, who is undeluded, and who is\na knower of the Supreme Being, such a person eternally abides with the Supreme\nBeing. (5.20)\n\n**Such a person who is in union with the Supreme Being becomes unattached to\nexternal sensual pleasures by discovering the joy of the Self through\ncontemplation, and enjoys transcendental bliss. (5.21)**\n\nSensual pleasures are verily the source of misery, and have a beginning and an\nend. Therefore the wise, O Arjuna, does not rejoice in sensual pleasures. (See\nalso 18.38) (5.22)\n\nOne who is able to withstand the impulse of lust and anger before death is a\nyogi, and a happy person. (5.23)\n\nOne who finds happiness with the Supreme Being, who rejoices Supreme Being\nwithin, and who is illuminated by Self-knowledge; such a yogi attains Nirvana,\nand goes to the Supreme Being. (5.24)\n\nSeers, whose sins (or imperfections) are destroyed, whose doubts have been\ndispelled by Self-knowledge, whose minds are disciplined, and who are engaged\nin the welfare of all beings, attain the Supreme Being. (5.25)\n\nThose who are free from lust and anger, who have subdued the mind and senses,\nand who have known the Self, easily attain Nirvana. (5.26)\n\n**_THE THIRD PATH \xc2\xbe THE PATH OF DEVOTIONAL MEDITATION AND CONTEMPLATION _**\n\nA sage is verily liberated by renouncing all sense enjoyments, fixing the eyes\nand the mind at an imaginary black dot between the eye brows, equalizing the\nbreath moving through the nostrils by using yogic techniques, keeping the\nsenses, mind, and intellect under control, having salvation as the prime goal,\nand by becoming free from lust, anger, and fear. (5.27-28)\n\nMy devotee attains peace by knowing the Supreme Being as the enjoyer of\nsacrifices and austerities, as the great Lord of the entire universe, and as\nthe friend of all beings. (5.29)\n\n**CHAPTER 6**\n\n**PATH OF MEDITATION**\n\n**_A KARMA-YOGI IS A RENUNCIANT_**\n\nLord Krishna said: One who performs the prescribed duty without seeking its\nfruit for personal enjoyment is a renunciant and a Karma-yogi. One does not\nbecome a renunciant merely by not lighting the fire, and one does not become a\nyogi merely by abstaining from work. (6.01)\n\nO Arjuna, renunciation (Samnyasa) is same as Karma-yoga. Because, no one\nbecomes a Karma-yogi who has not renounced the selfish motive behind an\naction. (See also 5.01, 5.05, 6.01, and 18.02) (6.02)\n\n**_A DEFINITION OF YOGA_**\n\n**For the wise, who seeks to attain yoga of meditation, or the equanimity of\nmind, Karma-yoga is said to be the means. For the one who has attained yoga,\nthe equanimity becomes the means of Self-realization. A person is said to have\nattained yogic perfection when he or she has no desire for sensual pleasures,\nor attachment to the fruits of work, and has renounced all personal selfish\nmotives. (6.03-04)**\n\n**_MIND IS THE BEST FRIEND AS WELL AS THE WORST ENEMY_**\n\n**One must elevate \xc2\xbe and not degrade \xc2\xbe oneself by one\xc2\x92s own mind. The mind\nalone is one\xc2\x92s friend as well as one\xc2\x92s enemy. The mind is the friend of those\nwho have control over it, and the mind acts like an enemy for those who do not\ncontrol it. (6.05-06)**\n\nOne who has control over the lower self \xc2\xbe the mind and senses \xc2\xbe is tranquil in\nheat and cold, in pleasure and pain, and in honor and dishonor, and remains\never steadfast with the supreme Self. (6.07)\n\nA person is called yogi who has both Self-knowledge and Self-realization, who\nis equanimous, who has control over the mind and senses, and to whom a clod, a\nstone, and gold are the same. (6.08)\n\n**A person is considered superior who is impartial towards companions,\nfriends, enemies, neutrals, arbiters, haters, relatives, saints, and sinners.\n(6.09)**\n\n**_TECHNIQUES OF MEDITATION_**\n\nA yogi, seated in solitude and alone, should constantly try to contemplate on\na mental picture or just the majesty of the Supreme Being after bringing the\nmind and senses under control, and becoming free from desires and\nproprietorship. (6.10)\n\nOne should sit on his or her own firm seat that is neither too high nor too\nlow, covered with grass, a deerskin, and a cloth, one over the other, in a\nclean spot. Sitting there in a comfortable position and concentrating the mind\non God, controlling the thoughts and the activities of the senses, one should\npractice meditation for self-purification. (6.11-12)\n\nOne should sit by holding the waist, spine, chest, neck, and head erect,\nmotionless and steady; fix the eyes and the mind steadily on the front of the\nnose, without looking around; make your mind serene and fearless, practice\ncelibacy; have the mind under control, think of Me, and have Me as the supreme\ngoal. (See also 4.29, 5.27, 8.10, and 8.12) (6.13-14)\n\nThus, by always practicing to keep the mind fixed on Me, the yogi whose mind\nis subdued attains peace of Nirvana and comes to Me. (6.15)\n\nThis yoga is not possible, O Arjuna, for the one who eats too much, or who\ndoes not eat at all; who sleeps too much or too little. (6.16)\n\nThe yoga of meditation destroys all sorrow for the one who is moderate in\neating, recreation, working, sleeping, and waking. (6.17)\n\nA person is said to have achieved yoga, the union with the Spirit, when the\nperfectly disciplined mind becomes free from all desires, and gets completely\nunited with the Spirit in trance. (6.18)\n\nA lamp in a spot sheltered by the Spirit from the wind of desires does not\nflicker. This simile is used for the subdued mind of a yogi practicing\nmeditation on the Spirit. (6.19)\n\nWhen the mind disciplined by the practice of meditation becomes steady, one\nbecomes content with the Spirit by beholding the Spirit of God with purified\nintellect. (6.20)\n\nOne feels infinite bliss that is perceivable only through the intellect, and\nis beyond the reach of the senses. After realizing the Absolute Reality, one\nis never separated from it. (6.21)\n\nAfter Self-realization (SR), one does not regard any other gain superior to\nSR. Established in SR, one is not moved even by the greatest calamity. (6.22)\n\nThe state of severance of union with sorrow is called yoga. This yoga should\nbe practiced with firm determination, and without any mental reservation.\n(6.23)\n\nOne gradually attains tranquillity of mind by totally abandoning all selfish\ndesires, completely restraining the senses from the sense objects by the\nintellect, and keeping the mind fully absorbed in the Spirit by means of a\nwell-trained and purified intellect and thinking of nothing else. (6.24-25)\n\n**Wheresoever this restless and unsteady mind wanders away, one should gently\nbring it back to the reflection of God. (6.26)**\n\n**_WHO IS A YOGI_**\n\nSupreme bliss comes to a Self-realized yogi whose mind is tranquil, whose\ndesires are under control, and who is free from faults. (6.27)\n\nSuch a sinless yogi, who constantly engages his or her mind and intellect with\nthe Spirit, easily enjoys the infinite bliss of contact with The Spirit.\n(6.28)\n\n**A yogi, who is in union with the Supreme Being, sees every being with an\nequal eye because of perceiving the omnipresent Spirit abiding in all beings,\nand all beings abiding in the Supreme Being. (See also 4.35, 5.18) (6.29)**\n\n**Those who perceive Me in everything, and behold everything in Me, are not\nseparated from Me, and I am not separated from them. (6.30)**\n\nThe non-dualists, who adore Me as abiding in all beings, abide in Me\nirrespective of their mode of living. (6.31)\n\n**One is considered the best yogi who regards every being like oneself, and\nwho can feel the pain and pleasures of others as one\xc2\x92s own, O Arjuna. (6.32)**\n\n**_TWO METHODS TO SUBDUE THE_**\n\n**_RESTLESS MIND_**\n\nArjuna said: O Krishna, You have said that the yoga of meditation is\ncharacterized by the equanimity of mind, but due to restlessness of mind I do\nnot perceive the steady state of mind. Because the mind, indeed, is very\nunsteady, turbulent, powerful, and obstinate, O Krishna. I think restraining\nthe mind is as difficult as restraining the wind. (6.33-34)\n\n**Lord Krishna said: Undoubtedly, O Arjuna, the mind is restless and difficult\nto restrain, but it is subdued by any constant vigorous spiritual practice \xc2\xbe\nsuch as meditation \xc2\xbe with perseverance, and by detachment, O Arjuna. (6.35)**\n\nIn My opinion, yoga is difficult for the one whose mind is not subdued.\nHowever, yoga is attainable by the person of subdued mind by striving through\nproper means. (6.36)\n\n**_DESTINATION OF UNSUCCESSFUL YOGI_**\n\nArjuna said: The faithful who deviates from the path of meditation and fails\nto attain yogic perfection due to unsubdued mind \xc2\x97 what is the destination of\nsuch a person, O Krishna? (6.37)\n\nDo they not perish like a dispersing cloud, O Krishna, having lost both the\nheavenly and the worldly pleasures, supportless and bewildered on the path of\nSelf-realization? (6.38)\n\nO Krishna, only You are able to completely dispel this doubt of mine. Because\nthere is none, other than You, who can dispel this doubt. (See also 15.15)\n(6.39)\n\nLord Krishna said: There is no destruction, O Arjuna, for a yogi either here\nor hereafter. A transcendentalist is never put to grief, My dear friend.\n(6.40)\n\nThe less evolved unsuccessful yogi is reborn in the house of the pious and\nprosperous after attaining heaven and living there for many years. The highly\nevolved unsuccessful yogi does not go to heaven, but is born in a spiritually\nadvanced family. A birth like this is very difficult, indeed, to obtain in\nthis world. (6.41-42)\n\nThere he or she regains the knowledge acquired in the previous life, and\nstrives again to achieve perfection, O Arjuna. (6.43)\n\n**The unsuccessful yogi is instinctively carried towards God by virtue of the\nimpressions of yogic practices of previous lives. Even the inquirer of yoga \xc2\xbe\nthe union with God \xc2\xbe surpasses those who perform Vedic rituals. (6.44)**\n\nThe yogi, who diligently strives, becomes completely free from all\nimperfections after gradually perfecting through many incarnations, and\nreaches the Supreme Abode. (6.45)\n\n**_WHO IS THE BEST YOGI_**\n\nThe yogi, who is devoted to meditation, is superior to the ascetics. The yogi\nis superior to the Vedic scholars. The yogi is superior to the ritualists.\nTherefore, O Arjuna, be a yogi. (6.46)\n\n**And I consider the yogi-devotee \xc2\xbe who lovingly contemplates on Me with\nsupreme faith, and whose mind is ever absorbed in Me \xc2\xbe to be the best of all\nthe yogis. (See also 12.02 and 18.66) (6.47)**\n\n**CHAPTER 7**\n\n**SELF-KNOWLEDGE AND ENLIGHTENMENT**\n\nLord Krishna said: O Arjuna, listen how you shall know Me fully without any\ndoubt, with your mind absorbed in Me, taking refuge in Me, and performing\nyogic practices. (7.01)\n\n**_METAPHYSICAL KNOWLEDGE IS THE ULTIMATE KNOWLEDGE_**\n\nI shall impart you Self-knowledge together with enlightenment, after\ncomprehending that nothing more remains to be known in this world. (7.02)\n\n**_SEEKERS ARE VERY FEW_**\n\nScarcely one out of thousands of persons strives for perfection of Self-\nrealization. Scarcely one among those successful strivers truly understands\nMe. (7.03)\n\n**_DEFINITIONS OF MATTER, CONSCIOUSNESS, AND SPIRIT_**\n\nThe mind, intellect, ego, ether, air, fire, water, and earth are the eightfold\ndivision of My material energy. (See also 13.05) (7.04)\n\n**The material Nature or matter is My lower Nature. My other higher Nature is\nthe Spirit by which this entire universe is sustained, O Arjuna. (7.05)**\n\n**_SUPREME SPIRIT IS THE BASIS OF MATTER, CONSCIOUSNESS, AND SPIRIT_**\n\n**Know that all creatures have evolved from this twofold energy; and the\nSupreme Spirit is the source of origin as well as dissolution of the entire\nuniverse. (See also 13.26) (7.06)**\n\n**There is nothing higher than the Supreme Being, O Arjuna. Everything in the\nuniverse is strung on the Supreme Being, like jewels are strung on the thread\nof a necklace. (7.07)**\n\n**_SUPREME SPIRIT IS THE BASIS_**\n\n**_OF EVERYTHING_**\n\nO Arjuna, I am the sapidity in the water, I am the radiance in the sun and the\nmoon, the sacred syllable OM in all the Vedas, the sound in the ether, and\npotency in human beings. I am the sweet fragrance in the earth. I am the heat\nin the fire, the life in all living beings, and the austerity in the ascetics.\n(7.08-09)\n\nO Arjuna, know Me to be the eternal seed of all creatures. I am the\nintelligence of the intelligent, and the brilliance of the brilliant. (See\nalso 9.18 and 10.39). I am the strength of the strong who is devoid of selfish\nattachment. I am the lust in human beings that is devoid of sense\ngratification, and is in accord with Dharma (for the sacred purpose of\nprocreation after marriage), O Arjuna. (7.10-11)\n\nKnow that three modes of material Nature \xc2\xbe goodness, passion, and ignorance \xc2\xbe\nalso emanate from Me. I am not dependent on, or affected by, the modes of\nmaterial Nature; but the modes of material Nature are dependent on Me. (See\nalso 9.04 and 9.05) (7.12)\n\nHuman beings are deluded by various aspects of these three modes of material\nNature; therefore, they do not know Me, who is eternal and above these modes.\n(7.13)\n\n**_HOW TO OVERCOME THE DELUSIVE DIVINE POWER (MAYA)_**\n\n**This divine power (Maya) of Mine, consisting of three states of matter or\nmind, is very difficult to overcome. Only those who surrender unto Me easily\ncross over this Maya. (See also 14.26, 15.19, and 18.66) (7.14)**\n\n**_WHO SEEKS GOD?_**\n\nThe evil doers, the ignorant, the lowest persons who are attached to demonic\nnature, and whose power of discrimination has been taken away by divine\nillusive power (Maya) do not worship or seek Me. (7.15)\n\n**Four types of virtuous ones worship or seek Me, O Arjuna. They are: The\ndistressed, the seeker of Self-knowledge, the seeker of wealth, and the\nenlightened one who has experienced the Supreme Being. (7.16)**\n\nAmong them the enlightened devotee, who is ever united with Me and whose\ndevotion is single-minded, is the best. Because I am very dear to the\nenlightened, and the enlightened is very dear to Me. (7.17)\n\nAll these seekers are indeed noble. But, I regard the enlightened devotee as\nMy very Self, because the one who is steadfast abides in My Supreme Abode.\n(See also 9.29) (7.18)\n\n**After many births the enlightened one resorts to Me by realizing that\neverything is, indeed, My (or Supreme Being\xc2\x92s) manifestation. Such a great\nsoul is very rare. (7.19)**\n\nPersons, whose discernment has been carried away by various desires impelled\nby their Karmic impression, resort to celestial controllers and practice\nvarious religious rites. (7.20)\n\n**_WORSHIP OF DEITY IS ALSO A_**\n\n**_WORSHIP OF GOD_**\n\n**Whosoever desires to worship whatever deity \xc2\x97 using any name, form, and\nmethod \xc2\x97 with faith, I make their faith steady in that very deity. Endowed\nwith steady faith they worship that deity, and obtain their wishes through\nthat deity. Those wishes are, indeed, granted only by Me. (7.21-22)**\n\nSuch material gains of these less intelligent human beings are temporary. The\nworshipers of celestial controllers go to celestial controllers, but My\ndevotees certainly come to Me. (7.23)\n\n**_GOD CAN BE SEEN IN AN IMAGE OF ANY DESIRED FORM OF WORSHIP_**\n\n**The ignorant ones \xc2\x97 unable to understand My immutable, incomparable,\nincomprehensible, and transcendental form \xc2\x97 assume that I, the Supreme Being,\nam formless and take forms or incarnate. Concealed by My divine power (Maya),\nI do not reveal Myself to such ignorants who do not know and understand My\nunborn, eternal, and transcendental form and personality. (7.24-25)**\n\nI know, O Arjuna, the beings of the past, of the present, and those of the\nfuture, but no one really knows Me. (7.26)\n\nAll beings in this world are in utter ignorance due to delusion of pairs of\nopposites born of likes and dislikes, O Arjuna. But persons of unselfish\ndeeds, whose Karma or sin has come to an end, become free from the delusion of\npairs of opposites and worship Me with firm resolve. (7.27-28)\n\nThose who strive for freedom from the cycles of birth, old age, and death \xc2\x97 by\ntaking refuge in God \xc2\x97 fully comprehend the true nature and powers of the\nSupreme. (7.29)\n\nThe steadfast persons, who know Me alone as the basis of all \xc2\xbe the mortal\nbeings, Temporal Beings, and the Eternal Being \xc2\xbe even at the time of death,\nattain Me. (See also 8.04) (7.30)\n\n**CHAPTER 8**\n\n**THE ETERNAL SPIRIT**\n\nArjuna said: O Krishna, who is the Eternal Being or the Spirit? What is the\nnature of the Eternal Being? What is Karma? Who are the mortal beings? And who\nare Temporal Beings? Who is the Supreme Being, and how does He dwell in the\nbody? How can You, the Supreme Being, be remembered at the time of death by\nthose who have control over their minds, O Krishna? (8.01-02)\n\n**_DEFINITION OF SUPREME SPIRIT, SPIRIT, INDIVIDUAL SOUL, AND KARMA_**\n\n**Lord Krishna said: The eternal and immutable Spirit of the Supreme Being is\nalso called Eternal Being or the Spirit. The inherent power of cognition and\ndesire of Eternal Being (Spirit) is called the nature of Eternal Being. The\ncreative power of Eternal Being (or Spirit) that causes manifestation of the\nliving entity is called Karma. (8.03)**\n\nVarious expansions of the Supreme Being are also called Temporal Beings or\nDivine Beings. The Supreme Being also resides inside the physical bodies as\nthe divine Controller. (8.04)\n\n**_THEORY OF REINCARNATION AND KARMA_**\n\nThe one who remembers the Supreme Being exclusively even while leaving the\nbody at the time of death, attains the Supreme Abode; there is no doubt about\nit. (8.05)\n\n**Remembering whatever object one leaves the body at the end of life, one\nattains that object. Thought of whatever object prevails during one\'s\nlifetime, one remembers only that object at the end of life and achieves it.\n(8.06)**\n\n**_A SIMPLE METHOD OF GOD-REALIZATION_**\n\n**Therefore, always remember Me and do your duty. You shall certainly attain\nMe if your mind and intellect are ever focused on Me. (8.07)**\n\nBy contemplating on Me with an unwavering mind that is disciplined by the\npractice of meditation, one attains the Supreme Being, O Arjuna. (8.08)\n\nOne who meditates on the Supreme Being \xc2\xbe as the omniscient, the oldest, the\ncontroller, smaller than the smallest and bigger than the biggest, the\nsustainer of everything, the inconceivable, the self-luminous like the sun,\nand transcendental (or beyond the material reality) \xc2\xbe at the time of death\nwith steadfast mind and devotion by making the flow of bioimpulses rise up to\nthe middle of the eye brows by the power of yogic practices; one attains the\nSupreme Being. (See also verses 4.29, 5.27, 6.13) (8.09-10)\n\nNow I shall briefly explain the process to attain the Supreme Abode that the\nknowers of the Veda call immutable; into which the ascetics, freed from\nattachment, enter; and desiring which people lead a life of celibacy. (8.11)\n\n**_ATTAIN SALVATION BY MEDITATING ON GOD AT THE TIME OF DEATH_**\n\n**When one leaves the physical body by controlling all the senses; focusing\nthe mind on God, and the bioimpulses (Pranas) in the cerebrum; engaged in\nyogic practice; meditating on Me and uttering OM \xc2\xbe the sacred monosyllable\nsound power of Spirit \xc2\xbe one attains the Supreme Abode. (8.12-13)**\n\n**I am easily attainable, O Arjuna, by that ever steadfast devotee who always\nthinks of Me and whose mind does not go elsewhere. (8.14)**\n\nAfter attaining Me, the great souls do not incur rebirth in this miserable\ntransitory world, because they have attained the highest perfection. (8.15)\n\nThe dwellers of all the worlds \xc2\xbe up to and including the world of the creator\n\xc2\xbe are subject to the miseries of repeated birth and death. But, after\nattaining Me, O Arjuna, one does not take birth again. (See also 9.25) (8.16)\n\n**_EVERYTHING IN THE CREATION IS CYCLIC_**\n\nThose who know that the duration of creation lasts 4.32 billion years and that\nthe duration of destruction also lasts 4.32 billion years, they are the\nknowers of the cycles of creation and destruction. (8.17)\n\nAll manifestations come out of the primary material Nature during the creative\ncycle, and they merge into the primary material Nature during the destructive\ncycle. (8.18)\n\n**The same multitude of beings comes into existence again and again at the\narrival of the creative cycle; and is annihilated, inevitably, at the arrival\nof the destructive cycle. (8.19)**\n\nThere is another eternal transcendental existence \xc2\xbe higher than the changeable\nmaterial Nature \xc2\xbe called Eternal Being or Spirit that does not perish when all\ncreated beings perish. This is also called the Supreme Abode. Those who attain\nthe Supreme Abode do not take birth again. (8.20-21)\n\n**_TWO BASIC PATHS OF DEPARTURE_**\n\n**_FROM THE WORLD_**\n\nThis Supreme Abode, O Arjuna, is attainable by unswerving devotion to Me\nwithin which all beings exist, and by which the entire universe is pervaded.\n(See also 9.04 and 11.55) (8.22)\n\nO Arjuna, now I shall describe different paths departing by which, during\ndeath, the yogis do or do not come back. (8.23)\n\nFire, light, daytime, the bright lunar fortnight, and the six months of the\nnorthern solstice of the sun \xc2\x97 departing by the path of these celestial\ncontrollers, yogis who know the Spirit attain the Supreme. (8.24)\n\nSmoke, night, the dark lunar fortnight, and the six months of southern\nsolstice of the sun \xc2\x97 departing by these paths, the righteous person attains\nheaven and comes back to earth. (8.25)\n\n**The path of light of spiritual practice and Self-knowledge and the path of\ndarkness of materialism and ignorance are thought to be the world\xc2\x92s two\neternal paths. The former leads to salvation and the latter leads to rebirth\nas human beings. (8.26)**\n\n**_TRANSCENDENTAL KNOWLEDGE_**\n\n**_LEADS TO SALVATION_**\n\nKnowing these two paths, O Arjuna, a yogi is not bewildered at all. Therefore,\none should be resolute in attaining salvation \xc2\x97 the goal of human birth \xc2\x97 at\nall times. (8.27)\n\nThe one who knows all this knowledge goes beyond getting the benefits of the\nstudy of the Vedas, performance of sacrifices, austerities, and charities; and\nattains salvation. (8.28)\n\n**CHAPTER 9**\n\n**SUPREME KNOWLEDGE AND**\n\n**THE BIG MYSTERY**\n\nLord Krishna said: I shall reveal to you, who do not disbelieve, the most\nprofound secret transcendental knowledge together with transcendental\nexperience. Having known this you will be freed from the miseries of worldly\nexistence. (9.01)\n\n**_KNOWLEDGE OF THE NATURE OF SUPREME IS THE BIGGEST MYSTERY_**\n\nThis Self-knowledge is the king of all knowledge, is the most secret, is very\nsacred, it can be perceived by instinct, conforms to righteousness (Dharma),\nis very easy to practice, and is timeless. (9.02)\n\nO Arjuna, those who have no faith in this knowledge do not attain Me, and\nfollow the cycles of birth and death. (9.03)\n\n**This entire universe is an expansion of Mine. All beings depend on Me (like\na chain depends on gold, and the milk products depend on milk). I do not\ndepend on \xc2\xbe or affected by \xc2\xbe them; because I am the highest of all. (See also\n7.12) (9.04)**\n\n** Look at the power of My divine mystery; in reality, I \xc2\xbe the sustainer and\ncreator of all beings \xc2\xbe do not depend on them, and they also do not depend on\nMe. (In fact, the gold-chain does not depend on gold; the gold-chain is\nnothing but gold. Also, matter and energy are different as well as non-\ndifferent). (9.05)**\n\n**Perceive that all beings remain in Me \xc2\x97 without any contact or without\nproducing any effect \xc2\x97 as the mighty wind, moving everywhere, eternally\nremains in space. (9.06)**\n\n**_THEORY OF EVOLUTION AND INVOLUTION_**\n\nAll beings merge into My primary material Nature at the end of a cycle of just\nover 311 trillion solar years, O Arjuna, and I create them again at the\nbeginning of the next cycle. (See also 8.17) (9.07)\n\nI create the entire multitude of beings again and again with the help of My\nmaterial Nature. These beings are under control of the modes of material\nNature. (9.08)\n\nThese acts of creation do not bind Me, O Arjuna, because I remain indifferent\nand unattached to those acts. (9.09)\n\nThe divine kinetic energy (Maya) \xc2\xbe with the help of material Nature \xc2\xbe creates\nall animate and inanimate objects under My supervision, and thus the creation\nkeeps on going, O Arjuna. (See also 14.03) (9.10)\n\n**_WAYS OF THE WISE, AND OF THE IGNORANT ARE DIFFERENT_**\n\nThe ignorant persons despise Me when I appear in human form, because they do\nnot know My transcendental nature as the great Lord of all beings, and take Me\nfor an ordinary human being. They are unable to recognize Me, because they\nhave false hopes, false actions, and false knowledge; and possess delusive\nqualities of fiends and demons. (9.11-12)\n\nBut great souls, O Arjuna, who possess divine qualities (See 16.01-03) know Me\nas immutable; as the material and efficient cause of creation, and worship Me\nsingle-mindedly with loving devotion. (9.13)\n\nPersons of firm resolve worship Me with ever-steadfast devotion by always\nsinging My glories, striving to attain Me, and prostrating before Me with\ndevotion. (9.14)\n\nSome worship Me by acquiring the knowledge of God. Others worship the infinite\nas the One in all (or non-dual), as the master of all (or dual), and in\nvarious other ways. (9.15)\n\n**_EVERYTHING IS A MANIFESTATION_**\n\n**_OF THE ABSOLUTE_**\n\nI am the ritual, I am the sacrifice, I am the offering, I am the herb, I am\nthe mantra, I am the clarified butter, I am the fire, and I am the oblation.\n(See also 4.24). I am the supporter of the universe, the father, the mother,\nand the grandfather. I am the object of knowledge, the sacred syllable OM, and\nthe Vedas. I am the goal, the supporter, the Lord, the witness, the abode, the\nrefuge, the friend, the origin, the dissolution, the foundation, the\nsubstratum, and the immutable seed. (See also 7.10 and 10.39) (9.16-18)\n\nI give heat, I send as well as withhold the rain. I am immortality as well as\ndeath, I am also both the eternal Absolute and the temporal, O Arjuna. (The\nSupreme Being has become everything, See also 13.12) (9.19)\n\n**_ATTAIN SALVATION BY_**\n\n**_DEVOTIONAL LOVE_**\n\nThe doers of the rituals prescribed in the Vedas, the drinkers of the nectar\nof devotion, and whose sins are cleansed, worship Me by doing good deeds for\ngaining heaven. As a result of their meritorious deeds they go to heaven and\nenjoy celestial sense pleasures. (9.20)\n\nThey return to the mortal world \xc2\xbe after enjoying the wide world of heavenly\npleasures \xc2\xbe upon exhaustion of the fruits of their good Karma. Thus following\nthe injunctions of the Vedas, persons working for the fruit of their actions\ntake repeated birth and death. (See also 8.25) (9.21)\n\n**I personally take care of both spiritual and material welfare of those ever-\nsteadfast devotees who always remember and adore Me with single-minded\ncontemplation. (9.22)**\n\nO Arjuna, even those devotees who worship the deities with faith, they also\nworship Me, but in an improper way. (9.23)\n\nBecause I, the Supreme Being, alone am the enjoyer of all sacrificial\nservices, and Lord of the universe. But people do not know My true\ntranscendental nature. Therefore, they fall into the repeated cycles of birth\nand death. (9.24)\n\nWorshippers of the celestial controllers go to the celestial controllers, the\nworshippers of the ancestors go to the ancestors, and the worshippers of the\nghosts go to the ghosts, but My devotees come to Me, and are not born again.\n(See also 8.16) (9.25)\n\n**_LORD ACCEPTS AND EATS THE OFFERING OF LOVE AND DEVOTION_**\n\n**Whosoever offers Me a leaf, a flower, a fruit, or water with devotion; I\naccept and eat the offering of devotion by the pure-hearted. (9.26)**\n\n**O Arjuna, whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer as oblation\nto the sacred fire, whatever charity you give, whatever austerity you perform,\ndo all that as an offering unto Me. (See also 12.10, 18.46) (9.27)**\n\nYou shall become free from the bondage \xc2\xbe good and bad \xc2\xbe of Karma and come to\nMe by this attitude of complete renunciation. (9.28)\n\n**The Self is present equally in all beings. There is no one hateful or dear\nto Me. But, those who worship Me with love and devotion are very close to Me,\nand I am also very close to them. (See also 7.18) (9.29)**\n\n**_THERE IS NO UNFORGIVABLE SINNER_**\n\n**Even if the most sinful person resolves to worship Me with single-minded\nloving devotion, such a person must be regarded as a saint because of making\nthe right resolution. (9.30)**\n\nSuch a person soon becomes righteous and attains everlasting peace. Be aware,\nO Arjuna, that My devotee shall never perish or fall down. (9.31)\n\n**_PATH OF DEVOTIONAL LOVE IS EASIER_**\n\nAnybody can attain the Supreme Abode by just surrendering unto My will with\nloving devotion, O Arjuna. (See also 18.66) (9.32)\n\nThen, it should be very easy for the wise and devout sages to attain the\nSupreme Being. Therefore, having obtained this joyless and transitory human\nlife, one should always worship Me with loving devotion. (9.33)\n\n**Always think of Me, be devoted to Me, worship Me, and bow down to Me. Thus\nuniting yourself with Me by setting Me as the supreme goal and the sole\nrefuge, you shall certainly come to Me. (9.34)**\n\n**CHAPTER 10**\n\n**MANIFESTATION OF THE ABSOLUTE**\n\nLord Krishna said: O Arjuna, listen once again to My supreme word that I shall\nspeak to you, who is very dear to Me, for your welfare. (10.01)\n\n**_GOD IS THE ORIGIN OF EVERYTHING_**\n\nNeither the celestial controllers, nor the great sages know My origin, because\nI am the origin of celestial controllers and great sages also. (10.02)\n\nOne who knows Me as the unborn, the beginningless, and the Supreme Lord of the\nuniverse, is considered wise among the mortals, and becomes liberated from the\nbondage of Karma. (10.03)\n\nDiscrimination, Self-knowledge, non-delusion, forgiveness, truthfulness,\ncontrol over the mind and senses, tranquillity, pleasure, pain, birth, death,\nfear, fearlessness; nonviolence, equanimity, contentment, austerity, charity,\nfame, ill fame \xc2\xbe these diverse qualities in human beings arise from Me alone.\n(10.04-05)\n\nThe great saints, sages, and all the creatures of the world were born from My\npotential energy. (10.06)\n\nOne who truly understands My manifestations and yogic powers is united with Me\nby unswerving devotion. There is no doubt about it. (10.07)\n\n**I am the origin of all. Everything emanates from Me. The wise ones who\nunderstand this adore Me with love and devotion. (10.08)**\n\nMy devotees remain ever content and delighted. Their minds remain absorbed in\nMe, and their lives surrendered unto Me. They always enlighten each other by\ntalking about Me. (10.09)\n\n**_LORD GIVES KNOWLEDGE TO_**\n\n**_HIS DEVOTEES_**\n\nI give the knowledge and understanding of the metaphysical science \xc2\xbe to those\nwho are ever united with Me and lovingly adore Me \xc2\xbe by which they come to Me.\n(10.10)\n\nI, who dwell within their inner psyche as consciousness, destroy the darkness\nborn of ignorance by the shining lamp of transcendental knowledge as an act of\ncompassion for them. (10.11)\n\nArjuna said: You are the Supreme Being, the Supreme Abode, the Supreme\nPurifier, the Eternal Being, the primal God, the unborn, and the omnipresent.\nAll saints and sages have thus acclaimed You, and now You Yourself are telling\nme. (10.12-13)\n\n**_NOBODY CAN KNOW THE REAL_**\n\n**_NATURE OF REALITY_**\n\nO Krishna, I believe all that You have told me to be true. O Lord, neither the\ncelestial controllers nor the demons fully understand Your real nature. (See\nalso 4.06) (10.14)\n\n**O Creator and Lord of all beings, God of all celestial rulers, the Supreme\nperson, and Lord of the universe, You alone know Yourself by Yourself.\n(10.15)**\n\nTherefore, You alone are able to fully describe Your own divine glories \xc2\xbe the\nmanifestations \xc2\xbe by which You exist pervading all the universes. (10.16)\n\nHow may I know You, O Lord, by constant contemplation? In what form of\nmanifestation are You to be thought of by me, O Lord? (10.17)\n\nO Lord, explain to me again in detail, Your yogic power and glory; because I\nam not satiated by hearing Your nectar-like words. (10.18)\n\n**_EVERYTHING IS A MANIFESTATION_**\n\n**_OF THE ABSOLUTE_**\n\nLord Krishna said: O Arjuna, now I shall explain to you My prominent divine\nmanifestations, because My manifestations are endless. (10.19)\n\nO Arjuna, I am the Supreme Spirit (or Supersoul) abiding in the inner psyche\nof all beings. I am also the creator, maintainer, and destroyer \xc2\xbe or the\nbeginning, the middle, and the end \xc2\xbe of all beings. (10.20)\n\nI am the sustainer, I am the radiant sun among the luminaries, I am the\ncontroller of wind, I am the moon among the stars. (10.21)\n\nI am the Vedas, I am the celestial rulers, I am the mind among the senses, I\nam the consciousness in living beings. (10.22)\n\nI am Lord Shiva, I am the god of wealth, I am the fire god, and the mountains.\n(10.23)\n\nI am the priest, and the army general of the celestial controllers, O Arjuna.\nI am the ocean among the bodies of water. (10.24)\n\nI am the monosyllable cosmic sound, OM, among the words; I am the chanting of\nmantra among the spiritual disciplines; and I am the Himalaya among the\nmountains. (10.25)\n\n**_A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DIVINE MANIFESTATIONS_**\n\nI am the holy fig tree among the trees, Narada among the sages, and I am all\nother celestial rulers. (10.26)\n\nKnow Me as the celestial animals among the animals, and the King among men. I\nam thunderbolt among the weapons, and I am the cupid for procreation.\n(10.27-28)\n\nI am the water-god, and the manes. I am the controller of death. I am the time\nor death among the healers, lion among the beasts, and the king of birds among\nbirds. (10.29-30)\n\nI am the wind among the purifiers, and Lord Rama among the warriors. I am the\ncrocodile among the fishes, and the holy Ganges river among the rivers.\n(10.31)\n\nI am the beginning, the middle, and the end of all creation, O Arjuna. Among\nthe knowledge I am knowledge of the supreme Self. I am logic of the logician.\n(10.32)\n\nI am the letter "A" among the alphabets. I am the dual compound among the\ncompound words. I am the endless time. I am the sustainer, and I am\nomniscient. (10.33)\n\nI am the all devouring death, and also the origin of future beings. I am the\nseven goddesses or guardian angels presiding over the seven qualities \xc2\xbe fame,\nprosperity, speech, memory, intellect, resolve, and forgiveness. (10.34)\n\nI am the Vedic and other hymns. I am the mantras, I am November-December among\nthe months, I am the spring among the seasons. (10.35)\n\n**I am gambling of the cheats; splendor of the splendid; victory of the\nvictorious; resolution of the resolute; and goodness of the good. (10.36)**\n\nI am Krishna, Vyasa, Arjuna, and the power of rulers, the statesmanship of the\nseekers of victory. I am silence among the secrets, and the Self-knowledge of\nthe knowledgeable. (10.37-38)\n\nI am the origin of all beings, O Arjuna. There is nothing, animate or\ninanimate, that can exist without Me. (See also 7.10 and 9.18) (10.39)\n\n**_MANIFEST CREATION IS A VERY SMALL FRACTION OF THE ABSOLUTE_**\n\nThere is no end of My divine manifestations, O Arjuna. This is only a brief\ndescription by Me of the extent of My divine manifestations. (10.40)\n\nWhatever is endowed with glory, brilliance, and power; know that to be a\nmanifestation of a very small fraction of My splendor. (10.41)\n\nWhat is the need for this detailed knowledge, O Arjuna? I continually support\nthe entire universe by a very small fraction of My divine power. (10.42)\n\n**CHAPTER 11**\n\n**VISION OF THE COSMIC FORM**\n\nArjuna said: My illusion is dispelled by the profound words of wisdom You\nspoke \xc2\xbe out of compassion towards me \xc2\xbe about the supreme secret of Spirit.\n(11.01)\n\nO Krishna, I have heard from You in detail about the origin and dissolution of\nbeings, and Your immutable glory. (11.02)\n\n**_VISION OF GOD IS THE ULTIMATE_**\n\n**_AIM OF A SEEKER_**\n\n**O Lord, You are as You have said; yet I wish to see Your divine cosmic form,\nO Supreme Being. (11.03)**\n\nO Lord, if You think it is possible for me to see Your universal form, then, O\nLord of the yogis, show me Your transcendental form. (11.04)\n\nLord Krishna said: O Arjuna, behold My hundreds and thousands of multifarious\ndivine forms of different colors and shapes. Behold all the celestial beings,\nand many wonders never seen before. Also behold the entire creation \xc2\xbe animate,\ninanimate, and whatever else you like to see \xc2\xbe all at one place in My body.\n(11.05-07)\n\n**But, you are not able to see Me with your physical eye; therefore, I give\nyou the divine eye to see My majestic power and glory. (11.08)**\n\n**_LORD SHOWS HIS COSMIC_**\n\n**_FORM TO ARJUNA_**\n\nSanjaya said: O King, having said this; Lord Krishna, the great Lord of the\nmystic power of yoga, revealed His supreme majestic form to Arjuna. (11.09)\n\nArjuna saw the Universal Form of the Lord with many mouths and eyes, and many\nvisions of marvel, with numerous divine ornaments, and holding many divine\nweapons. Wearing divine garlands and apparel, anointed with celestial perfumes\nand ointments, full of all wonders, the limitless God with faces on all sides.\n(11.10-11)\n\nIf the splendor of thousands of suns were to blaze forth all at once in the\nsky, even that would not resemble the splendor of that exalted being. (11.12)\n\nArjuna saw the entire universe, divided in many ways, but standing as all in\nOne, and One in all in the transcendental body of Krishna, the Lord of\ncelestial rulers. (See also 13.16, and 18.20) (11.13)\n\n**_ONE MAY NOT BE PREPARED, OR QUALIFIED, TO SEE THE LORD_**\n\nHaving seen the cosmic form of the Lord, Arjuna was filled with wonder; and\nhis hairs standing on end, bowed his head to the Lord and prayed with folded\nhands. (11.14)\n\nArjuna said: O Lord, I see in Your body all supernatural controllers, and\nmultitude of beings, sages, and celestials. (11.15)\n\n**O Lord of the universe, I see You everywhere with infinite form, with many\narms, stomachs, faces, and eyes. O Universal Form, I see neither your\nbeginning nor the middle nor the end. (11.16)**\n\nI see You with Your crown, club, discus; and a mass of radiance, difficult to\nbehold, shining all around like the immeasurable brilliance of the sun and the\nblazing fire. (11.17)\n\nI believe You are the Supreme Being to be realized. You are the ultimate\nresort of the universe. You are the Spirit, and protector of the eternal order\n(Dharma). (11.18)\n\nI see You with infinite power, without beginning, middle, or end; with many\narms, with the sun and the moon as Your eyes, with Your mouth as a blazing\nfire scorching all the universe with Your radiance. (11.19)\n\nO Lord, You pervade the entire space between heaven and earth in all\ndirections. Seeing Your marvelous and terrible form, the three worlds are\ntrembling with fear. (11.20)\n\nHosts of supernatural rulers enter into You. Some with folded hands sing Your\nnames and glories in fear. A multitude of perfected beings hail and adores You\nwith abundant praises. (11.21)\n\nAll the celestial beings amazingly gaze at You. Seeing your infinite form with\nmany mouths, eyes, arms, thighs, feet, stomachs, and many fearful tusks; the\nworlds are trembling with fear and so do I, O mighty Lord. (11.22-23)\n\n**_ARJUNA IS FRIGHTENED TO_**\n\n**_SEE THE COSMIC FORM_**\n\nI am frightened and find neither peace nor courage, O Krishna, after seeing\nYour effulgent and colorful form touching the sky, and Your wide open mouth\nwith large shining eyes. (11.24)\n\nI lose my sense of direction and find no comfort after seeing Your mouths with\nfearful tusks glowing like the fires of cosmic dissolution. Have mercy on me!\nO Lord of celestial rulers, and refuge of the universe. (11.25)\n\nAll my cousin brothers, along with the hosts of other kings and warriors of\nthe other side, together with chief warriors on our side, are also quickly\nentering into Your fearful mouths with terrible tusks. Some are seen caught in\nbetween the tusks with their heads crushed. (11.26-27)\n\nThese warriors of the mortal world are entering Your blazing mouths as many\ntorrents of the rivers enter into the ocean. (11.28)\n\nAll these people are rapidly rushing into Your mouths for destruction as moths\nrush with great speed into the blazing flame for destruction. (11.29)\n\nYou are licking up all the worlds with Your flaming mouths, swallowing them\nfrom all sides. Your powerful radiance is filling the entire universe with\neffulgence and burning it, O Krishna. (11.30)\n\nTell me, who are You in such a fierce form? My salutations to You, O best of\nall celestial rulers, be merciful! I wish to understand You, O primal Being,\nbecause I do not know Your mission. (11.31)\n\n**_LORD DESCRIBES HIS POWERS_**\n\nLord Krishna said: I am death, the mighty destroyer of the world. I have come\nhere to destroy all these people. Even without your participation in the war,\nall the warriors standing arrayed in the opposing armies shall cease to exist.\n(11.32)\n\nTherefore, you get up and attain glory. Conquer your enemies, and enjoy a\nprosperous kingdom. I have already destroyed all these warriors. You are only\nan instrument, O Arjuna. (11.33)\n\nKill all these great warriors who are already killed by Me. Do not fear. You\nwill certainly conquer the enemies in the battle; therefore, fight! (11.34)\n\n**_ARJUNA\xc2\x92S PRAYERS TO THE COSMIC FORM_**\n\nSanjaya said: Having heard these words of Krishna; the crowned Arjuna,\ntrembling with folded hands, prostrated with fear and spoke to Krishna in a\nchoked voice. (11.35)\n\nArjuna said: Rightly, O Krishna, the world delights and rejoices in glorifying\nYou. Terrified demons flee in all directions. The hosts of sages bow to You in\nadoration. (11.36)\n\nWhy should they not \xc2\xbe O great soul \xc2\xbe bow to You, the original creator who is\neven greater than the creator of material worlds? O infinite Lord, O God of\nall celestial rulers, O abode of the universe, You are both Eternal and\nTemporal, and the Supreme Being that is beyond Eternal and Temporal. (See also\n9.19, and 13.12 for a commentary) (11.37)\n\nYou are the primal God, the most ancient Person. You are the ultimate resort\nof the entire universe. You are the knower, the object of knowledge, and the\nSupreme Abode. You, O Lord of the infinite form, pervade the entire universe.\n(11.38)\n\nYou are the controller of death, the fire, the wind, the water god, the moon\ngod, and the creator, as well as the father of the creator. Salutations to You\na thousand times, and again and again salutations to You. (11.39)\n\nMy salutations to You from front, and from behind. O Lord, my obeisance to You\nfrom all sides. You are infinite valor and the boundless might. You pervade\neverything, and therefore You are everywhere and in everything. (11.40)\n\nConsidering You merely as a friend, and not knowing Your greatness, I have\ninadvertently addressed You as O Krishna, O Yadava, and O friend merely out of\naffection or carelessness. (11.41)\n\nIn whatever way I may have insulted You in jokes; while playing, reposing in\nbed, sitting, or at meals; when alone, or in front of others; O Krishna, the\nimmeasurable One, I implore You for forgiveness. (11.42)\n\nYou are the father of this animate and inanimate world, and the greatest guru\nto be worshipped. No one is even equal to You in the three worlds; how can\nthere be one greater than You? O Being of incomparable glory. (11.43)\n\nTherefore, O adorable Lord, I seek Your mercy by bowing down and prostrating\nmy body before You. Bear with me as a father to his son, as a friend to a\nfriend, and as a husband to his wife, O Lord. (11.44)\n\nBeholding that which has never been seen before delights me, and yet my mind\nis tormented with fear. Therefore, O God of celestial rulers, the refuge of\nthe universe, have mercy on me; and show me your four-armed form. (11.45)\n\n**_ONE MAY SEE GOD IN ANY FORM_**\n\n**_OF ONE\'S CHOICE_**\n\nI wish to see You with a crown, holding mace and discus in Your hand.\nTherefore, O Lord with thousand arms and universal form, please appear in the\nfour-armed form. (11.46)\n\nLord Krishna said: O Arjuna, being pleased with you I have shown you, through\nMy own yogic powers, this particular supreme, shining, universal, infinite,\nand primal form of Mine that has never been seen before by anyone other than\nyou. (11.47)\n\nO Arjuna, neither by study of the Vedas, nor by sacrifice, nor by charity, nor\nby rituals, nor by severe austerities, can I be seen in this cosmic form by\nany one other than you in this human world. (11.48)\n\n**_LORD SHOWS ARJUNA HIS FOUR-ARMED AND THE HUMAN FORM_**\n\nDo not be perturbed and confused by seeing such a terrible form of Mine as\nthis. With fearless and cheerful mind, now behold My four-armed form. (11.49)\n\nSanjaya said: After speaking like this to Arjuna, Krishna revealed His four-\narmed form. And then assuming His pleasant human form, Lord Krishna, the Great\nOne, consoled Arjuna who was terrified. (11.50)\n\nArjuna said: O Krishna, seeing this lovely human form of Yours, I have now\nbecome tranquil and I am normal again. (11.51)\n\n**_LORD CAN BE SEEN BY DEVOTIONAL LOVE_**\n\nLord Krishna said: This four-armed form of Mine that you have seen is very\ndifficult, indeed, to see. Even celestial controllers are ever longing to see\nthis form. (11.52)\n\n**This four-armed form of Mine that you have just seen cannot be seen even by\nstudy of the Vedas, or by austerity, or by acts of charity, or by the\nperformance of rituals. (11.53)**\n\n**However, through single-minded devotion alone, I can be seen in this form,\ncan be known in essence, and also can be reached, O Arjuna. (11.54)**\n\n**The one who does all works for Me, and to whom I am the supreme goal; who is\nmy devotee, who has no attachment, and is free from enmity towards any being;\nattains Me, O Arjuna. (See also 8.22) (11.55)**\n\n**CHAPTER 12**\n\n**PATH OF DEVOTION**\n\n**_SHOULD ONE WORSHIP A PERSONAL_**\n\n**_OR AN IMPERSONAL GOD?_**\n\n**Arjuna asked: Those ever steadfast devotees who worship the personal aspect\nof God with form(s), and others who worship the impersonal aspect, or the\nformless Absolute; which of these has the best knowledge of yoga? (12.01)**\n\n**Lord Krishna said: Those ever steadfast devotees who worship with supreme\nfaith by fixing their mind on a personal form of God, I consider them to be\nthe best yogis. (See also 6.47) (12.02)**\n\nBut those who worship the unchangeable, the inexplicable, the invisible, the\nomnipresent, the inconceivable, the unchanging, the immovable, and the\nformless impersonal aspect of God; restraining all the senses, even-minded\nunder all circumstances, engaged in the welfare of all creatures, also attain\nGod. (12.03-04)\n\n**_REASONS FOR WORSHIPPING A_**\n\n**_PERSONAL FORM OF GOD_**\n\n**Self-realization is more difficult for those who fix their mind on the\nimpersonal, unmanifest, and formless Absolute; because, comprehension of the\nunmanifest by embodied beings is attained with difficulty. (12.05)**\n\nFor those who worship the Supreme with unswerving devotion as a personal deity\nof their choice, offer all actions to Me, intent on Me as the Supreme, and\nmeditate on Me; I swiftly become their savior \xc2\xbe from the world that is the\nocean of death and transmigration \xc2\xbe whose thoughts are set on My personal\nform, O Arjuna. (12.06-07)\n\n**_FOUR PATHS TO GOD_**\n\n**Therefore, focus your mind on Me, and let your intellect dwell upon Me alone\nthrough meditation and contemplation. Thereafter you shall certainly attain\nMe. (12.08)**\n\nIf you are unable to focus your mind steadily on Me, then long to attain Me by\npractice of any other spiritual discipline; such as a ritual, or deity worship\nthat suits you. (12.09)\n\nIf you are unable even to do any spiritual discipline, then be intent on\nperforming your duty just for Me. You shall attain perfection by doing your\nprescribed duty for Me \xc2\x97 without any selfish motive \xc2\x97 just as an instrument to\nserve and please Me. (12.10)\n\nIf you are unable to do your duty for Me, then just surrender unto My will,\nand renounce the attachment to, and the anxiety for, the fruits of all work \xc2\x97\nby learning to accept all results as God\'s grace \xc2\x97 with equanimity. (12.11)\n\n**_KARMA-YOGA IS THE BEST WAY_**\n\n**_TO START WITH_**\n\n**The transcendental knowledge of scriptures is better than mere ritualistic\npractice; meditation is better than scriptural knowledge; renunciation of\nselfish attachment to the fruits of work (Karma-yoga) is better than\nmeditation; peace immediately follows renunciation of selfish motives. (See\nmore on renunciation in 18.02, 18.09) (12.12)**\n\n**_THE ATTRIBUTES OF A DEVOTEE_**\n\nOne who does not hate any creature, who is friendly and compassionate, free\nfrom the notion of "I" and "my", even-minded in pain and pleasure, forgiving;\nand who is ever content, who has subdued the mind, whose resolve is firm,\nwhose mind and intellect are engaged in dwelling upon Me, who is devoted to\nMe, is dear to Me. (12.13-14)\n\nThe one by whom others are not agitated and who is not agitated by others, who\nis free from joy, envy, fear, and anxiety, is also dear to Me. (12.15)\n\nOne who is desireless, pure, wise, impartial, and free from anxiety; who has\nrenounced the doership in all undertakings; such a devotee is dear to Me.\n(12.16)\n\n**One who neither rejoices nor grieves, neither likes nor dislikes, who has\nrenounced both the good and the evil, and is full of devotion; is dear to Me.\n(12.17)**\n\nThe one who remains the same towards friend or foe, in honor or disgrace, in\nheat or cold, in pleasure or pain; who is free from attachment; who is\nindifferent to censure or praise; who is quiet, and content with whatever he\nor she has; unattached to a place, a country, or a house; equanimous, and full\nof devotion \xc2\xbe that person is dear to Me. (12.18-19)\n\n**_ONE SHOULD SINCERELY TRY TO_**\n\n**_DEVELOP DIVINE QUALITIES_**\n\nBut those faithful devotees, who set Me as their supreme goal and follow \xc2\x97 or\njust sincerely try to develop \xc2\x97 the above mentioned nectar of moral values are\nvery dear to Me. (12.20)\n\n**CHAPTER 13**\n\n**CREATION AND THE CREATOR**\n\n**_THEORY OF CREATION_**\n\nLord Krishna said: O Arjuna, this physical body, the miniature universe, may\nbe called the field or creation. One who knows the creation is called the\ncreator (or Spirit) by the seers of truth. (13.01)\n\n**O Arjuna, know Me to be the creator of all the creation. The true\nunderstanding of both the creator and the creation is considered by Me to be\nthe transcendental knowledge. (13.02)**\n\nWhat the creation is, what it is like, what its transformations are, where its\nsource is, who that creator is, and what His powers are, hear all these from\nMe in brief. (13.03)\n\nThe seers have separately described the creation and the creator in different\nways in the Vedic hymns, and also in the conclusive and convincing verses of\nother scriptures. (13.04)\n\nThe primary material Nature, the cosmic intellect, "I" consciousness or ego,\nfive basic elements, ten organs, mind, five sense objects; and desire, hatred,\npleasure, pain, the physical body, consciousness, and resolve \xc2\xbe thus the\nentire field has been briefly described with its transformations. (See also\n7.04) (13.05-06)\n\n**_THE FOURFOLD NOBLE TRUTH_**\n\n**_AS MEANS OF NIRVANA_**\n\nHumility, modesty, nonviolence, forgiveness, honesty, service to guru, purity\nof thought, word, and deed, steadfastness, self-control; and aversion towards\nsense objects, absence of ego, constant reflection on pain and suffering\ninherent in birth, old age, disease, and death; (13.07-08)\n\nDetachment, non-fondness with son, wife, and home; unfailing equanimity upon\nattainment of the desirable and the undesirable; and unswerving devotion to Me\nthrough single-minded contemplation, taste for solitude, distaste for social\ngatherings and gossips; steadfastness in acquiring the knowledge of Spirit,\nand seeing the omnipresent Supreme Being everywhere \xc2\xbe this is said to be\nknowledge. That which is contrary to this is ignorance. (13.09-11)\n\n**_GOD CAN BE DESCRIBED BY PARABLES, AND NOT IN ANY OTHER WAY_**\n\nI shall fully describe the object of knowledge. By knowing this one attains\nimmortality. The beginningless Supreme Being is said to be neither eternal,\nnor temporal. (See also 9.19, 11.37, and 15.18) (13.12)\n\nThe Spirit has His hands, feet, eyes, head, mouth, and ears everywhere,\nbecause He is all-pervading and omnipresent. (13.13)\n\nHe is the perceiver of all sense objects without the physical sense organs;\nunattached, and yet the sustainer of all; devoid of the three modes of\nmaterial Nature, and yet the enjoyer of the modes of material Nature by\nbecoming a living entity. (13.14)\n\nHe is inside as well as outside all beings, animate and inanimate. He is\nincomprehensible because of His subtlety. And because of His omnipresence, He\nis very near \xc2\xbe residing in one\xc2\x92s inner psyche; as well as far away \xc2\xbe in the\nSupreme Abode. (13.15)\n\nHe is undivided, and yet appears to exist as if divided in beings. He is the\nobject of knowledge, and appears as the creator, sustainer, and destroyer of\nall beings. (See also 11.13, and 18.20) (13.16)\n\nThe Supreme Being is the source of all lights. He is said to be beyond\ndarkness of ignorance. He is the Self-knowledge, the object of Self-knowledge,\nand seated in the inner psyche as consciousness (See verse 18.61) of all\nbeings, He is to be realized by Self-knowledge. (13.17)\n\nThus the creation as well as the knowledge and the object of knowledge have\nbeen briefly described by Me. Having understood this, My devotee attains My\nSupreme Abode. (13.18)\n\n**_A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPREME SPIRIT, SPIRIT, MATERIAL NATURE, AND THE\nINDIVIDUAL SOULS_**\n\nKnow that both the material Nature and the Spiritual Being are beginningless.\nAll manifestations and three dispositions of mind and matter, called modes,\nare born of material Nature. Material Nature is said to be the cause of\nproduction of physical body and organs of perception and action. Spirit (or\nConsciousness) is said to be the cause of experiencing pleasures and pains.\n(13.19-20)\n\n**Spiritual Being enjoys three modes of material Nature by associating with\nthe material Nature. Attachment to the three modes of material Nature due to\nignorance caused by previous Karma is the cause of birth of living entity in\ngood and evil wombs. (13.21)**\n\nThe Spirit in the body is the witness, the guide, the supporter, the enjoyer,\nand the controller. (13.22)\n\nThey who truly understand Spirit and the material Nature with its three modes\nare not born again regardless of their way of life. (13.23)\n\nSome perceive the Supersoul in their inner psyche through mind and intellect\nthat have been purified either by meditation, or by metaphysical knowledge, or\nby selfless service. (13.24)\n\n**_FAITH ALONE CAN LEAD TO NIRVANA_**\n\nOthers, however, do not know the yogas of meditation, knowledge, devotion, and\nwork; but they perform deity worship with faith as mentioned in the scriptures\nby the saints and sages. They also transcend death by virtue of their firm\nfaith to what they have heard. (13.25)\n\nWhatever is born \xc2\xbe animate or inanimate \xc2\xbe know them to be born from the union\nof Spirit and matter, O Arjuna. (See also 7.06) (13.26)\n\n**The one who sees the same eternal Supreme Lord dwelling as Spirit equally\nwithin all mortal beings truly sees. (13.27)**\n\nWhen one beholds one and the same Lord existing equally in everybeing, one\ndoes not injure anybody; because one considers everything as one\xc2\x92s own self.\nAnd thereupon attains the Supreme Abode. (13.28)\n\nThe one who perceives that all works are done by the powers of material Nature\ntruly understands, and thus does not consider oneself as the doer. (See also\n3.27, 5.09, and 14.19) (13.29)\n\nThe moment one discovers diverse variety of beings and their different ideas\nabiding in One, and coming out from \xc2\x91That\xc2\x92 alone, one attains the Supreme\nBeing. (13.30)\n\n**_ATTRIBUTES OF THE SPIRIT (BRAHM)_**\n\nBecause of being beginningless and unaffectable by three modes of material\nNature, the eternal Supersoul \xc2\xbe even though dwelling in the body as a living\nentity \xc2\xbe neither does anything nor becomes tainted, O Arjuna. (13.31)\n\nJust as the all-pervading space is not tainted because of its subtlety;\nsimilarly, the Spirit abiding in all bodies is not tainted. (13.32)\n\nJust as one sun illuminates the entire world; similarly, Spirit gives life to\nthe entire creation, O Arjuna. (13.33)\n\n**They who perceive \xc2\x97 with the eye of Self-knowledge \xc2\x97 the difference between\nthe creation (or the body) and the creator (or the Spirit) as well as know the\ntechnique of liberation of the living entity from the trap of divine illusory\nenergy (Maya), attain the Supreme. (13.34)**\n\n**CHAPTER 14**\n\n**THREE MODES OF MATERIAL NATURE**\n\nLord Krishna said: I shall further explain to you that supreme knowledge, the\nbest of all knowledge, knowing that all the sages have attained supreme\nperfection after this life. (14.01)\n\nThey who have taken refuge in this transcendental knowledge attain unity with\nMe; and are neither born at the time of creation, nor afflicted at the time of\ndissolution. (14.02)\n\n**_ALL BEINGS ARE BORN FROM THE UNION OF SPIRIT AND MATTER_**\n\n**My material Nature is the womb of creation wherein I place the seed of\nConsciousness from which all beings are born, O Arjuna. (See also 9.10)\n(14.03)**\n\nWhatever forms are produced in all different wombs, O Arjuna, the material\nNature is their body-giving mother; and the Spirit or Consciousness is the\nlife-giving father. (14.04)\n\n**_HOW THREE MODES OF MATERIAL NATURE BIND THE SPIRIT SOUL TO THE BODY_**\n\n**Goodness, activity, and inertia \xc2\x97 these three modes or ropes material Nature\nfetter the eternal individual soul to the body, O Arjuna. (14.05)**\n\nOf these, the mode of goodness is illuminating and good, because it is pure.\nThe mode of goodness fetters the living entity by attachment to happiness and\nknowledge, O sinless Arjuna. (14.06)\n\nArjuna, know that the mode of passion is characterized by intense craving for\nsense gratification, and is the source of material desire and attachment. The\nmode of passion binds the living entity by attachment to the fruits of work.\n(14.07)\n\nKnow, O Arjuna, that the mode of ignorance \xc2\xbe the deluder of living entity \xc2\xbe is\nborn of inertia. The mode of ignorance binds living entity by carelessness,\nlaziness, and excessive sleep. (14.08)\n\nO Arjuna, the mode of goodness attaches one to happiness of learning and\nknowing the Spirit, the mode of passion attaches to action, and the mode of\nignorance attaches to negligence by covering the Self-knowledge. (14.09)\n\n**_CHARACTERISTICS OF THREE_**\n\n**_MODES OF NATURE_**\n\nGoodness prevails by suppressing passion and ignorance; passion prevails by\nsuppressing goodness and ignorance; and ignorance prevails by suppressing\ngoodness and passion, O Arjuna. (14.10)\n\nWhen the light of Self-knowledge glitters all the senses in the body, then it\nshould be known that goodness is predominant. (14.11)\n\nO Arjuna, when passion is predominant; greed, activity, undertaking of selfish\nworks, restlessness, and excitement arise. (14.12)\n\nO Arjuna, when inertia is predominant; ignorance, inactivity, carelessness,\nand delusion arise. (14.13)\n\n**_THREE MODES ARE ALSO THE VEHICLES OF TRANSMIGRATION FOR THE INDIVIDUAL\nSOUL_**\n\nOne who dies during the dominance of goodness goes to heaven \xc2\xbe the pure world\nof knowers of the Supreme. (14.14)\n\nWhen one dies during the dominance of passion, one is reborn as attached to\naction (or the utilitarian type); and dying in ignorance, one is reborn as\nlower creatures. (14.15)\n\nThe fruit of good action is said to be beneficial and pure, the fruit of\npassionate action is pain, and the fruit of ignorant action is laziness.\n(14.16)\n\nSelf-knowledge arises from mode of goodness; greed arises from mode of\npassion; and negligence, delusion, and slowness of mind arise from the mode of\nignorance. (14.17)\n\nThey who are established in goodness go to heaven; passionate persons are\nreborn in the mortal world; and the insipid ones, abiding in the mode of\nignorance, go to lower planets of hell, or take birth as lower creatures\ndepending on the degree of their ignorance. (14.18)\n\n**_ATTAIN NIRVANA AFTER TRANSCENDING THREE MODES OF MATERIAL NATURE_**\n\nWhen visionaries perceive no doer other than the powers of the Supreme Being \xc2\xbe\nthe modes of material Nature; and know That which is above and beyond these\nmodes; then they attain Nirvana or salvation. (See also 3.27, 5.09, and 13.29)\n(14.19)\n\n**When one rises above the three modes of material Nature that originate in\nthe body, one attains immortality or salvation, and is freed from the pains of\nbirth, old age, and death. (14.20)**\n\n**_THE PROCESS OF RISING ABOVE_**\n\n**_THE THREE MODES_**\n\nArjuna said: What are the marks of those who have transcended the three modes\nof material Nature, and what is their conduct? How does one transcend these\nthree modes of material Nature, O Lord Krishna? (14.21)\n\nLord Krishna said: One who neither hates the presence of enlightenment,\nactivity, and delusion; nor desires for them when they are absent; who remains\nlike a witness without being affected by the modes of material Nature; and\nstays firmly attached to the Lord without wavering \xc2\xbe thinking that the modes\nof material Nature only are operating. (14.22-23)\n\nThe one who depends on the Lord and is indifferent to pain and pleasure; to\nwhom a clod, a stone, and gold are alike; to whom the dear and the unfriendly\nare alike; who is of firm mind, who is calm in censure and in praise, and the\none who is indifferent to honor and disgrace, who is impartial to friend and\nfoe, and who has renounced the sense of doership \xc2\xbe is said to have transcended\nthe modes of material Nature. (14.24-25)\n\n**_BONDS OF THREE MODES CAN BE_**\n\n**_CUT BY DEVOTIONAL LOVE_**\n\n**The one who offers service to Me with love and unswerving devotion\ntranscends three modes of material Nature, and becomes fit for Nirvana, or\nsalvation. (See also 7.14 and 15.19) (14.26)**\n\nBecause, I am the basis (or source) of the immortal Spirit, of everlasting\ncosmic order (Dharma), and of the absolute bliss. (14.27)\n\n**CHAPTER 15**\n\n**THE SUPREME BEING**\n\n**_CREATION IS LIKE A TREE CREATED BY THE POWERS OF MAYA_**\n\nLord Krishna said: The universe (or human body) may be compared to an eternal\ntree that has its origin (or root) in the Supreme Being and its branches below\nin the cosmos. The Vedic hymns are the leaves of this tree. One who\nunderstands this tree is a knower of the Vedas. (15.01)\n\nThe branches of this eternal tree are spread all over the cosmos. The tree is\nnourished by the energy of material Nature; sense pleasures are its sprouts;\nand its roots of ego and desires stretch below in the human world causing\nKarmic bondage. (15.02)\n\n**_HOW TO CUT THE TREE OF ATTACHMENT AND ATTAIN SALVATION BY TAKING REFUGE IN\nGOD_**\n\nThe beginning, the end, or the real form of this tree is not perceptible on\nthe earth. Having cut the firm roots \xc2\xbe the desires \xc2\xbe of this tree by the\nmighty ax of Self-knowledge and detachment, one should seek that Supreme Abode\nreaching where one does not come back to the mortal world again. One should be\nalways thinking: "In that very primal person I take refuge from which this\nprimal manifestation comes forth." (15.03-04)\n\n**Those who are free from pride and delusion, who have conquered the evil of\nattachment, who are constantly dwelling in the Supreme Being with all lust\ncompletely stilled, who are free from dualities of pleasure and pain; such\nwise ones reach My Supreme Abode. (15.05)**\n\nThe sun does not illumine My Supreme Abode, nor the moon, nor the fire. Having\nreached there people attain permanent liberation (Mukti), and do not come back\nto this temporal world. (15.06)\n\n**_THE EMBODIED SOUL IS THE ENJOYER_**\n\n**The individual soul (Jiva, Jivatma) in the body of living beings is the\nintegral part of the universal Spirit, or consciousness. The individual soul\nassociates with the six sensory faculties \xc2\xbe including the mind \xc2\xbe of perception\nand activates them. (15.07)**\n\n**Just as the air takes aroma away from the flower; similarly, the individual\nsoul takes the six sensory faculties from the physical body it casts off\nduring death to the new physical body it acquires in reincarnation. (See also\n2.13) (15.08)**\n\nThe living entity enjoys sense pleasures using six sensory faculties of\nhearing, touch, sight, taste, smell, and mind. The ignorant cannot perceive\nliving entity departing from the body, or staying in the body and enjoying\nsense pleasures by associating with the material body. But those who have the\neye of Self-knowledge can see it. (15.09-10)\n\nThe yogis, striving for perfection, behold the living entity abiding in their\ninner psyche as consciousness; but the ignorant whose inner psyche is not\npure, cannot perceive Him even though striving. (15.11)\n\n**_SPIRIT IS THE ESSENCE OF EVERYTHING_**\n\nThe light energy that coming from the sun illumines the whole world; and that\nin the moon, and in the fire; know that light to be Mine. (See also 13.17 and\n15.06) (15.12).\n\nEntering the earth, I support all beings with My energy; becoming the sap-\ngiving moon, I nourish all the plants. (15.13)\n\nBecoming the digestive fire, I remain in the body of all living beings;\nuniting with vital breaths or bioimpulses, I digest all types of food; and\n(15.14)\n\n**I am seated in the inner psyche of all beings. The memory, Self-knowledge,\nand the removal of doubts and wrong notions about God come from Me. I am\nverily that which is to be known by the study of all the Vedas. I am, indeed,\nthe author as well as the student of the Vedas. (See also 6.39) (15.15)**\n\n**_WHAT ARE THE SUPREME SPIRIT, SPIRIT_**\n\n**_AND THE INDIVIDUAL SOUL?_**\n\nThere are two entities in the cosmos: The changeable Temporal Beings, and the\nunchangeable Eternal Being (Spirit). All created beings are subject to change,\nbut the Spirit does not change. (15.16)\n\nThe Supreme Being is beyond both \xc2\xbe the Temporal Beings and the Eternal Being.\nHe is also called the Absolute Reality that sustains both the Temporal and the\nEternal by pervading everything. (15.17)\n\n**Because the Supreme Being is beyond both Temporal and Eternal; therefore, He\nis known in this world and in the scriptures as the Supreme Being (Absolute\nReality, Truth, Supersoul) (15.18)**\n\nThe wise one who truly understands the Supreme Being, knows everything and\nworships Him wholeheartedly. (See also 7.14, 14.26, and 18.66) (15.19)\n\nThus this most secret transcendental science of the Absolute has been\nexplained by Me. Having understood this, one becomes enlightened, and one\xc2\x92s\nall duties are accomplished, O Arjuna. (15.20)\n\n**CHAPTER 16**\n\n**DIVINE AND THE DEMONIC QUALITIES**\n\n**_A LIST OF MAJOR DIVINE QUALITIES THAT SHOULD BE CULTIVATED FOR SALVATION_**\n\nLord Krishna said: Fearlessness, purity of inner psyche, perseverance in the\nyoga of Self-knowledge, charity, sense restraint, sacrifice, study of the\nscriptures, austerity, honesty; nonviolence, truthfulness, absence of anger,\nrenunciation, equanimity, abstaining from malicious talk, compassion for all\ncreatures, freedom from greed, gentleness, modesty, absence of fickleness,\nsplendor, forgiveness, fortitude, cleanliness, absence of malice, and absence\nof pride \xc2\xbe these are some of the qualities of those endowed with divine\nvirtues, O Arjuna. (16.01-03)\n\n**_A LIST OF DEMONIC QUALITIES THAT SHOULD BE GIVEN UP BEFORE SPIRITUAL\nJOURNEY CAN BEGIN_**\n\nO Arjuna, the marks of those who are born with demonic qualities are:\nHypocrisy, arrogance, pride, anger, harshness, and ignorance. (16.04)\n\nDivine qualities lead to salvation, the demonic qualities are said to be for\nbondage. Do not grieve, O Arjuna, you are born with divine qualities. (16.05)\n\n**_THERE ARE ONLY TWO TYPES OF HUMAN BEINGS \xc2\xbe THE WISE AND THE IGNORANT _**\n\nThere are only two types (or castes) of human beings in this world: The\ndivine, or the wise; and the demonic, or the ignorant. The divine has been\ndescribed at length, now hear from Me about the demonic, O Arjuna. (16.06)\n\nPersons of demonic nature do not know what to do and what not to do. They\nneither have purity nor good conduct nor truthfulness. (16.07)\n\nThey say: The world is unreal, without a substratum, without a God, and\nwithout an order. Sexual union of man and woman alone and nothing else causes\nthe world. (16.08)\n\nAdhering to this wrong atheist view, these degraded souls \xc2\x97 with small\nintellect and cruel deeds \xc2\xbe are born as enemies for the destruction of the\nworld. (16.09)\n\nFilled with insatiable desires, hypocrisy, pride, and arrogance; holding wrong\nviews due to delusion; they act with impure motives. (16.10)\n\nObsessed with endless anxiety lasting until death, considering sense\ngratification their highest aim, convinced that sense pleasure is everything;\n(16.11)\n\nBound by hundreds of ties of desire and enslaved by lust and anger; they\nstrive to obtain wealth by unlawful means for the fulfillment of sensual\npleasures. They think: (16.12)\n\nThis has been gained by me today, I shall fulfill this desire, I have this\nmuch wealth, and will have more wealth in the future; (16.13)\n\nThat enemy has been slain by me, and I shall slay others also. I am the Lord.\nI am the enjoyer. I am successful, powerful, and happy; (16.14)\n\nI am rich and born in a noble family. Who is equal to me? I shall perform\nsacrifice, I shall give charity, and I shall rejoice. Thus deluded by\nignorance; (16.15)\n\nBewildered by many fancies; entangled in the net of delusion; addicted to the\nenjoyment of sensual pleasures; they fall into a foul hell. (16.16)\n\nSelf-conceited, stubborn, filled with pride and intoxication of wealth; they\nperform service only in name, for show, and not according to scriptural\ninjunction. (16.17)\n\nThese malicious people cling to egoism, power, arrogance, lust, and anger; and\nhate Me who dwells in their own bodies and those of others. (16.18)\n\n**_SUFFERING IS THE DESTINY OF_**\n\n**_THE IGNORANT_**\n\nI hurl these haters, cruel, sinful, and mean people into the cycles of rebirth\nin the womb of demons again and again. (16.19)\n\nO Arjuna, entering the wombs of demons birth after birth, the deluded ones\nsink to the lowest hell without ever attaining Me (until their minds change\nfor the better by the causeless mercy of the Lord). (16.20)\n\n**_LUST, ANGER, AND GREED ARE THE_**\n\n**_THREE GATES TO HELL_**\n\n**Lust, anger, and greed are the three gates of hell leading to the downfall\n(or bondage) of the individual. Therefore, one must learn to give up these\nthree. (16.21)**\n\nOne who is liberated from these three gates of hell, O Arjuna, does what is\nbest for him or her, and consequently attains the Supreme Abode. (16.22)\n\n**_ONE MUST FOLLOW THE_**\n\n**_SCRIPTURAL INJUNCTIONS_**\n\nOne, who acts under the influence of his or her desires, disobeying scriptural\ninjunctions, neither attains perfection nor happiness, nor the Supreme Abode.\n(16.23)\n\n**Therefore, let the scripture be your authority in determining what should be\ndone and what should not be done. You should perform your duty following the\nscriptural injunction. (16.24)**\n\n**CHAPTER 17**\n\n**THREEFOLD FAITH**\n\nArjuna said: What is the mode of devotion of those who perform spiritual\npractices with faith but without following the scriptural injunctions, O\nKrishna? Is it in the mode of goodness, passion, or ignorance? (17.01)\n\n**_THREE TYPES OF FAITH_**\n\nLord Krishna said: The natural faith of embodied beings is of three kinds:\nGoodness, passion, and ignorance. Now hear about these from Me. (17.02)\n\n**O Arjuna, the faith of each is in accordance with one\xc2\x92s own natural\ndisposition that is governed by Karmic impressions. A person is known by the\nfaith. One can become whatever one wants to be, if one constantly contemplates\non the object of desire with faith. (17.03)**\n\nPersons in the mode of goodness worship celestial controllers; those in the\nmode of passion worship supernatural rulers and demons; and those in the mode\nof ignorance worship ghosts and spirits. (17.04)\n\nThey who practice severe austerities without following the prescription of the\nscriptures; who are full of hypocrisy and egotism; who are impelled by the\nforce of desire and attachment; who senselessly torture the elements in their\nbody and also Me who dwells within the body, know these ignorant persons to be\nof demonic nature. (17.05-06)\n\n**_THREE TYPES OF FOOD_**\n\nThe food preferred by all of us is also of three types. So are the sacrifice,\nausterity, and charity. Now hear the distinction between them. (17.07)\n\nThe foods that promote longevity, virtue, strength, health, happiness, and joy\nare juicy, smooth, substantial, and nutritious. Persons in the mode of\ngoodness like such foods. (17.08)\n\nFoods that are very bitter, sour, salty, hot, pungent, dry, and burning; and\ncause pain, grief, and disease; are liked by persons in the mode of passion.\n(17.09)\n\nThe foods liked by people in the mode of ignorance are stale, tasteless,\nputrid, rotten, refuses, and impure (such as meat and alcohol). (17.10)\n\n**_THREE TYPES OF SACRIFICES_**\n\nSelfless service enjoined by the scriptures, and performed without the desire\nfor the fruit, with a firm belief and conviction that it is a duty, is in the\nmode of goodness. (17.11)\n\nSelfless service that is performed only for show, and aiming for fruit, know\nthat to be in the mode of passion, O Arjuna. (17.12)\n\nSelfless service that is performed without following the scripture, in which\nno food is distributed, which is devoid of mantra, faith, and gift, is said to\nbe in the mode of ignorance. (17.13)\n\n**_AUSTERITY OF THOUGHT,_**\n\n**_WORD, AND DEED_**\n\nThe worship of celestial controllers, the priest, guru, and the wise; purity,\nhonesty, celibacy, and nonviolence; these are said to be the austerity of\ndeed. (17.14)\n\n**Speech that is non-offensive, truthful, pleasant, beneficial, and is used\nfor the regular study of scriptures is called the austerity of word. (17.15)**\n\nThe serenity of mind, gentleness, equanimity, self-control, and the purity of\nthought \xc2\xbe these are called the austerity of thought. (17.16)\n\n**_THREE TYPES OF AUSTERITY_**\n\nThe above mentioned threefold austerity (of thought, word, and deed) practiced\nby yogis with supreme faith, without a desire for the fruit, is said to be in\nthe mode of goodness. (17.17)\n\nAusterity that is performed for gaining respect, honor, reverence, and for the\nsake of show that yields an uncertain and temporary result is said to be in\nthe mode of passion. (17.18)\n\nAusterity performed with foolish stubbornness, or with self-torture, or for\nharming others, is declared to be in the node of ignorance. (17.19)\n\n**_THREE TYPES OF CHARITY_**\n\nCharity that is given as a matter of duty, to a deserving candidate who does\nnothing in return, at the right place and time, is considered to be charity in\nthe mode of goodness. (17.20)\n\n**Charity that is given unwillingly, or to get something in return, or looking\nfor some fruit, is said to be in the mode of passion. (17.21)**\n\nCharity that is given at a wrong place and time, and to unworthy persons; or\nwithout paying respect to the receiver or with ridicule, is said to be in the\nmode of ignorance. (17.22)\n\n**_THREEFOLD NAME OF GOD_**\n\nThe Spirit is all pervading. The persons with divine qualities, the Vedas, and\nthe selfless service were created by and from the Spirit. (17.23)\n\nTherefore, acts of sacrifice, charity, and austerity prescribed in the\nscriptures are always commenced by uttering any one of the many names of God\nsuch as OM, Amen, or Allah by the knowers of the Supreme. (17.24)\n\nThe seekers of salvation perform various types of sacrifice, charity, and\nausterity by uttering "He is all" without seeking a reward. (17.25)\n\nThe word "Truth" is used in the sense of Reality and goodness. The word Truth\nis also used for an auspicious act, O Arjuna. (17.26)\n\nFaith in sacrifice, charity, and austerity is also called Truth. The selfless\nservice for the sake of the Supreme is verily termed as Truth. (17.27)\n\n**Whatever is done without faith \xc2\xbe whether it is sacrifice, charity,\nausterity, or any other act \xc2\xbe is useless. It has no value here or hereafter, O\nArjuna. (17.28)**\n\n**CHAPTER 18**\n\n**SALVATION THROUGH RENUNCIATION**\n\nArjuna said: I wish to know the nature of renunciation and sacrifice, and the\ndifference between the two, O Lord Krishna. (18.01)\n\n**_DEFINITION OF RENUNCIATION_**\n\n**_AND SACRIFICE_**\n\n**Lord Krishna said: The sages define renunciation as abstaining from all work\nfor personal profit. The wise define sacrifice as the sacrifice of, and the\nfreedom from, the selfish attachment to the fruits of all work. (See also\n5.01, 5.05, and 6.01) (18.02)**\n\nSome philosophers say that all work is full of faults and should be given up,\nwhile others say that acts of sacrifice, charity, and austerity should not be\nabandoned. (18.03)\n\nO Arjuna, listen to My conclusion about sacrifice. Sacrifice is said to be of\nthree types. (18.04)\n\nActs of service, charity, and austerity should not be abandoned, but should be\nperformed, because service, charity, and austerity are the purifiers of the\nwise. (18.05)\n\nEven these obligatory works should be performed without attachment to the\nfruits. This is My definite supreme advice, O Arjuna. (18.06)\n\n**_THREE TYPES OF SACRIFICE_**\n\nGiving up one\'s duty is not proper. The abandonment of obligatory work is due\nto delusion, and is declared to be in the mode of ignorance. (18.07)\n\nOne who abandons duty merely because it is difficult, or because of fear of\nbodily trouble, does not get the benefits of sacrifice by performing such a\nsacrifice in the mode of passion. (18.08)\n\nObligatory work performed as duty, renouncing selfish attachment to the fruit,\nis alone regarded to be sacrifice in the mode of goodness, O Arjuna. (18.09)\n\nThe one who neither hates a disagreeable work, nor is attached to an agreeable\nwork, is considered a renunciant (Tyagi), imbued with the mode of goodness,\nintelligent, and free from all doubts about the Supreme Being. (18.10)\n\n**Human beings cannot completely abstain from work. Therefore, the one who\ncompletely renounces the selfish attachment to the fruits of all works is\nconsidered a renunciant. (18.11)**\n\nThe threefold fruit of works \xc2\x97 desirable, undesirable, and mixed \xc2\xbe accrues\nafter death to the one who is not a renunciant (Tyagi), but never to a Tyagi.\n(18.12)\n\n**_FIVE CAUSES OF ANY ACTION_**\n\nLearn from Me, O Arjuna, the five causes, as described in the Sankhya\ndoctrine, for the accomplishment of all actions. They are: The physical body,\nthe seat of Karma; the modes of material Nature, the doer; the eleven organs\nof perception and action, the instruments; various bioimpulses; and the fifth\nis the presiding deities of the eleven organs. (18.13-14)\n\nWhatever action, whether right or wrong, one performs by thought, word, and\ndeed; these are its five causes. (18.15)\n\nTherefore, the ignorant one who considers one\xc2\x92s body or the soul as the sole\nagent due to imperfect knowledge does not understand. (18.16)\n\nThe one who is free from the notion of doership, and whose intellect is not\npolluted by the desire to reap the fruit; even after slaying these people, he\nor she neither slays nor is bound by the act of killing. (18.17)\n\nThe subject, the object, and the knowledge of the object are the threefold\ndriving force to an action. The eleven organs; the act, and the agent or the\nmodes of material Nature are the three components of action. (18.18)\n\n**_THREE TYPES OF KNOWLEDGE_**\n\nSelf-knowledge, action), and agent are said to be of three types according to\nSankhya doctrine. Hear duly about these also. (18.19)\n\nThe knowledge by which one sees a single immutable Reality in all beings as\nundivided in the divided; such knowledge is in the mode of goodness. (See also\n11.13, and 13.16) (18.20)\n\nThe knowledge by which one sees different realities of various types among all\nbeings as separate from one another; consider that knowledge to be in the mode\nof passion. (18.21)\n\nThe irrational, baseless, and worthless knowledge by which one clings to one\nsingle effect (such as the body) as if it is everything; such knowledge is\ndeclared to be in the mode of darkness of ignorance (18.22)\n\n**_THREE TYPES OF ACTION_**\n\nThe obligatory duty performed without likes and dislikes, and without selfish\nmotives and attachment to enjoy the fruit, is said to be in the mode of\ngoodness. (18.23)\n\nAction performed with ego, with selfish motives, and with too much effort; is\ndeclared to be in the mode of passion. (18.24)\n\nAction that is undertaken because of delusion; disregarding consequences,\nloss, injury to others, as well as one\xc2\x92s own ability is said to be in the mode\nof ignorance. (18.25)\n\n**_THREE TYPES OF AGENT_**\n\nThe agent who is free from attachment, is non-egotistic, endowed with resolve\nand enthusiasm, and unperturbed in success or failure is called good. (18.26)\n\nThe agent who is impassioned, attached to the fruits of their work, greedy,\nviolent, impure, and is affected by joy and sorrow is called passionate.\n(18.27)\n\nThe undisciplined, vulgar, stubborn, wicked, malicious, lazy, depressed, and\nprocrastinating agent is called ignorant. (18.28)\n\n**_THREE TYPES OF INTELLECT_**\n\nNow hear the threefold division of intellect and resolve, based on modes of\nmaterial Nature, as explained by Me fully and separately, O Arjuna. (18.29)\n\nO Arjuna, the intellect by which one understands the path of work and the path\nof renunciation, right and wrong action, fear and fearlessness, bondage and\nliberation, that intellect is in the mode of goodness. (18.30)\n\nThe intellect by which one cannot distinguish between righteousness (Dharma)\nand unrighteousness (Adharma), and right and wrong action; that intellect is\nin the mode of passion, O Arjuna. (18.31)\n\nThe intellect \xc2\xbe when covered by ignorance \xc2\xbe accepts unrighteousness (Adharma)\nas righteousness (Dharma), and thinks everything to be that which it is not,\nis in the mode of ignorance, O Arjuna. (18.32)\n\n**_THREE TYPES OF RESOLVE, AND THE FOUR GOALS OF HUMAN LIFE_**\n\nThe resolve by which one manipulates the functions of the mind, Prana\n(bioimpulses), and senses for God-realization only; that resolve is in the\nmode of goodness, O Arjuna. (18.33)\n\nThe resolve by which a person, craving for the fruits of work, clings to duty,\naccumulating wealth, and enjoyment with great attachment; that resolve, O\nArjuna, is in the mode of passion. (18.34)\n\nThe resolve by which a dull person does not give up sleep, fear, grief,\ndespair, and carelessness; that resolve is in the mode of ignorance, O Arjuna.\n(18.35)\n\n**_THREE TYPES OF PLEASURE_**\n\nAnd now hear from Me, O Arjuna, about the threefold pleasure. The pleasure one\nenjoys from spiritual practice results in cessation of all sorrows. (18.36)\n\nThe pleasure that appears as poison in the beginning, but is like nectar in\nthe end, comes by the grace of Self-knowledge, and is in the mode of goodness.\n(18.37)\n\n**Sensual pleasures appear as nectar in the beginning, but become poison in\nthe end; such pleasures are in the mode of passion. (See also 5.22) (18.38)**\n\nPleasure that confuses a person in the beginning and in the end; which comes\nfrom sleep, laziness, and carelessness; such pleasure is said to be in the\nmode of ignorance. (18.39)\n\nThere is no being, either on the earth or among the celestial controllers in\nthe heaven, who can remain free from these three modes of material Nature.\n(18.40)\n\n**_DIVISION OF LABOR IS BASED_**\n\n**_ON ONE\xc2\x92S ABILITY_**\n\nThe division of human labor is also based on the qualities inherent in\npeoples\xc2\x92 nature or their make up. (See also 4.13) (18.41)\n\nThose who have serenity, self control, austerity, purity, patience, honesty,\ntranscendental knowledge, transcendental experience, and belief in God are\nlabeled as intellectuals (Braahmans). (18.42)\n\nThose having the qualities of heroism, vigor, firmness, dexterity, not fleeing\nfrom battle, charity, and administrative skills are called leaders or\nprotectors (Kshatriyas). (18.43)\n\nThose who are good in cultivation, cattle rearing, business, trade, finance,\nand industry are known as business men (Vaishyas). Those who are very good in\nservice and labor type work only are classed as workers (Shudras). (18.44)\n\n**_ATTAINMENT OF SALVATION THROUGH DUTY, DISCIPLINE, AND DEVOTION_**\n\nOne can attain the highest perfection by devotion to one\xc2\x92s natural work.\nListen to Me how one attains perfection while engaged in one\xc2\x92s natural work.\n(18.45)\n\n**One attains perfection by worshipping the Supreme Being \xc2\xbe from whom all\nbeings originate, and by whom all this universe is pervaded \xc2\xbe through\nperformance of one\xc2\x92s natural duty for Him. (See also 9.27, 12.10) (18.46)**\n\nOne\xc2\x92s inferior natural work is better than superior unnatural work even though\nwell performed. One who does the work ordained by one\xc2\x92s inherent nature,\nwithout any selfish motive, incurs no sin (or Karmic reaction). (See also\n3.35) (18.47)\n\nOne\xc2\x92s natural work, even though defective, should not be abandoned; because\nall undertakings are enveloped by defects as fire is covered by smoke, O\nArjuna. (18.48)\n\nThe person whose mind is always free from selfish attachment, who has subdued\nthe mind and senses, and who is free from desires attains the supreme\nperfection of freedom from the bondage of Karma by renouncing selfish\nattachment to the fruits of work. (18.49)\n\nLearn from Me briefly, O Arjuna, how one who has attained such perfection, or\nthe freedom from the bondage of Karma, attains Supreme Being, the goal of\ntranscendental knowledge. (18.50)\n\nEndowed with purified intellect, subduing the mind with firm resolve, turning\naway from sound and other objects of the senses, giving up likes and dislikes;\nliving in solitude, eating lightly, controlling the mind, speech, and organs\nof action, ever absorbed in yoga of meditation, taking refuge in detachment;\nand after relinquishing egotism, violence, pride, lust, anger, and\nproprietorship; one becomes peaceful, free from the notion of "I, me, and my",\nand fit for attaining oneness with the Supreme Being. (18.51-53)\n\nAbsorbed in the Supreme Being, the serene one neither grieves nor desires;\nbecoming impartial to all beings, one obtains the highest devotional love for\nGod. (18.54)\n\n**By devotion one truly understands what and who I am in essence. Having known\nMe in essence, one immediately merges with Me. (See also 5.19) (18.55)**\n\nA Karma-yogi devotee attains the eternal immutable abode by My grace \xc2\xbe even\nwhile doing all duties \xc2\xbe just by taking refuge in Me (by surrendering all\naction to Me with loving devotion). (18.56)\n\n**Sincerely offer all actions to Me, set Me as your supreme goal, and\ncompletely depend on Me. Always fix your mind on Me, and resort to Karma-yoga.\n(18.57)**\n\nYou shall overcome all difficulties by My grace when your mind becomes fixed\non Me. But, if you do not listen to Me due to ego, you shall perish. (18.58)\n\n**_THE KARMIC BONDAGE_**\n\nIf due to ego you think: I shall not fight; this resolve of yours is vain.\nBecause your own nature will compel you to fight. (18.59)\n\nO Arjuna, you are controlled by your own nature-born Karmic impressions.\nTherefore, you shall do \xc2\xbe even against your will \xc2\xbe what you do not wish to do\nout of delusion. (18.60)\n\n**_WE BECOME THE PUPPETS OF_**\n\n**_OUR OWN FREEWILL_**\n\n**The Supreme Lord \xc2\x97 as the controller abiding in the inner psyche of all\nbeings \xc2\x97 causes them to work out their Karma like a puppet (of Karma created\nby the free will) mounted on a machine. (18.61)**\n\nSeek refuge in the Supreme Lord alone with loving devotion, O Arjuna. By His\ngrace you shall attain supreme peace and the Eternal Abode. (18.62)\n\nThus the knowledge that is more secret than the secret has been explained to\nyou by Me. After fully reflecting on this, do as you wish. (18.63)\n\n**_PATH OF SURRENDER IS THE_**\n\n**_ULTIMATE PATH TO GOD_**\n\nHear once again My most secret, supreme word. You are very dear to Me,\ntherefore, I shall tell this for your benefit. (18.64)\n\nFix your mind on Me, be devoted to Me, offer service to Me, bow down to Me,\nand you shall certainly reach Me. I promise you because you are My very dear\nfriend. (18.65)\n\n**Set aside all meritorious deeds and religious rituals, and just surrender\ncompletely to My will with firm faith and loving devotion. I shall liberate\nyou from all sins, the bonds of Karma. Do not grieve. (18.66)**\n\nThis knowledge should never be spoken by you to one who is devoid of\nausterity, who is without devotion, who does not desire to listen, or who\nspeaks ill of Me. (18.67)\n\n**_THE HIGHEST SERVICE TO GOD,_**\n\n**_AND THE BEST CHARITY_**\n\n**The one who shall propagate this supreme secret philosophy \xc2\xbe the\ntranscendental knowledge of the Gita \xc2\xbe amongst My devotees, shall be\nperforming the highest devotional service to Me, and shall certainly come to\nMe. No other person shall do a more pleasing service to Me, and no one on the\nearth shall be more dear to Me. (18.68-69)**\n\n**_GRACE OF THE GITA_**\n\nI promise the study of this sacred dialogue of ours will be equivalent to\nworshipping Me with knowledge-sacrifice. (18.70)\n\nWhoever hears this sacred dialogue with faith and without cavil becomes free\nfrom sin, and attains heaven \xc2\xbe the higher worlds of those whose actions are\npure and virtuous. (18.71)\n\nO Arjuna, did you listen to this with single-minded attention? Has your\ndelusion born of ignorance been completely destroyed? (18.72)\n\nArjuna said: By Your grace my delusion is destroyed, I have gained Self-\nknowledge, my confusion with regard to body and Spirit is dispelled and I\nshall obey Your command. (18.73)\n\nSanjaya said: Thus I heard this wonderful dialogue between Lord Krishna and\nArjuna, causing my hair to stand on end. (18.74)\n\nBy the grace of sage Vyasa, I heard this most secret and supreme yoga directly\nfrom Krishna, the Lord of yoga, Himself speaking to Arjuna before my very eyes\nof clairvoyance granted by sage Vyasa. (18.75)\n\nO King, by repeated remembrance of this marvelous and sacred dialogue between\nLord Krishna and Arjuna, I am thrilled at every moment; and (18.76)\n\nRecollecting again and again, O King, that marvelous form of Krishna I am\ngreatly amazed and I rejoice over and over again. (18.77)\n\n**_BOTH TRANSCENDENTAL KNOWLEDGE AND ACTION ARE NEEDED FOR A BALANCED\nLIVING_**\n\n**Wherever there will be both Krishna, the Lord of yoga, or Dharma in the form\nof the scriptures, and Arjuna with the weapons of duty and protection; there\nwill be everlasting prosperity, victory, happiness, and morality. This is my\nconviction.
