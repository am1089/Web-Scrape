He who having initiated a youth and instructed him in the Vratas[1],\nteaches him (one branch of) the Veda (together with its A _n_ gas, such as\nthat relating to phonetics, and the rest) is called \xc3\x82 _k_ arya (teacher).\n\n[51. [1] Taitt. \xc3\x82ra _n_ y. I, 30.\n\nXXIX. 1. \xc3\x82past. I, 1, 1, 13; Gaut., I, 9.--13. M. II. 140-143; Y. I, 34, 35.--\n7-10. M. II, 111, 112, 114, 115.--9, 10. See Buhler, Introd. to Digest, p.\nxxix.\n\n1\\. The Vratas of a student are certain observances to be kept by him before\nhe is admitted to the regular course of study of the Veda, and again before he\nis allowed to proceed to the study of the Mahanamni verses and to the other\nhigher stages of Vedic learning. See, particularly, _S_ a _n_ kh. II, 11, 12,\nwith Dr. Oldenberg's note (Ind. Stud. XV, 139).]\n\np. 122\n\n2\\. He who teaches him (after he has been initiated by another) either (an\nentire branch of the Veda) in consideration of a fee, or part of a Veda\n(without taking a fee), is called Upadhyaya (sub-teacher).\n\n3\\. He who performs sacrifices (whether based upon _S_ ruti or upon Sm _ri_\nti) is called _Ri_ tvi _g_ (officiating priest).\n\n4\\. He must not engage a priest for the performance of sacrifices without\nhaving ascertained (his descent, character, and conduct).\n\n5\\. Neither must he admit to his teaching (one whom he does not know).\n\n6\\. And he must not initiate such a one.\n\n7\\. If one answers improperly, or the other asks improperly[1], that one (or\nboth) will perish or incur hatred.\n\n8\\. If by instructing a pupil neither religious merit nor wealth are acquired,\nand if no sufficient attention is to be obtained from him (for his teacher's\nwords), in such soil divine knowledge must not be sown: it would perish like\nfine seed in barren soil.\n\n9\\. The deity of sacred knowledge approached a Brahma _n_ a (and said to him),\n'Preserve me, I am thy treasure, reveal me not to a scorner, nor to a wicked\nman, nor to one of uncontrolled passions: thus I shall be strong\n\n10\\. 'Reveal me to him, as to a keeper of thy gem, O Brahma _n_ a, whom thou\nshalt know to be pure, attentive, possessed of a good memory, and chaste, who\nwill not grieve thee, nor revile thee.'\n\n[7. 1 A proper question is, e. g. if the pupil modestly says, 'I don't know\nabout this, therefore I want to be instructed.' An improper question is, e.g.\nif he says, 'Why do you pronounce this thus wrongly?' An improper answer is an\nanswer to an improper question.
