(To live according to) the rule of conduct is doubtlessly the highest duty\nof all men. He whose soul is defiled by vile conduct perishes in this world\nand in the next. 1\n\n2\\. Neither austerities, nor (the study of) the Veda, nor (the performance of)\nthe Agnihotra, nor lavish liberality can ever save him whose conduct is vile\nand who has strayed from this (path of duty).\n\n3\\. The Vedas do not purify him who is deficient in good conduct, though he\nmay have learnt them all together with the six A\xe1\xb9\x85gas; the sacred texts depart\nfrom such a man at death, even as birds, when full-fledged, leave their nest.\n\n4\\. As the beauty of a wife causes no joy to a blind man, even so all the four\nVedas together with the six A\xe1\xb9\x85gas and sacrifices give no happiness to him who\nis deficient in good conduct. 4\n\np. 35\n\n5\\. The sacred texts do not save from sin the deceitful man who behaves\ndeceitfully. But that Veda, two syllables of which are studied in the right\nmanner, purifies, just as the clouds (give beneficent rain) in the month of\nIsha. 5\n\n6\\. A man of bad conduct is blamed among men, evils befal him constantly, he\nis afflicted with disease and short-lived. 6\n\n7\\. Through good conduct man gains spiritual merit, through good conduct he\ngains wealth, through good conduct he obtains beauty, good conduct obviates\nthe effect of evil marks. 7\n\n8\\. A man who follows the rule of conduct established among the virtuous, who\nhas faith and is free from envy, lives a hundred years, though he be destitute\nof all auspicious marks. 8\n\np. 36\n\n9\\. But a man who knows the sacred law shall perform in secret all acts\nconnected with eating, the natural evacuations and dalliance with (his wife);\nbusiness to be accomplished by speech or intellect, likewise austerities,\nwealth, and age, must be most carefully concealed.\n\n10\\. And a man shall void both urine and faeces, facing the north, in the day-\ntime, but at night he shall do it turning towards the south; for (if he acts)\nthus, his life will not be injured. 10\n\n11: The intellect of that man perishes who voids urine against a fire, the\nsun, a cow, a Brahma _n_ a, the moon, water, and the morning or evening\ntwilights. 11\n\n12\\. Let him not void urine in a river, nor on a path, nor on ashes, nor on\ncowdung, nor on a ploughed field, nor on one which has been sown, nor on a\ngrass-plot, nor in the shade (of trees) that afford protection (to\ntravellers). 12\n\n13\\. Standing in the shade (of houses, clouds, and so forth), when it is quite\ndark, and when he fears for his life, a Brahma _n_ a may void urine, by day\nand by night, in any position he pleases. 13\n\n14\\. (Afterwards) he shall perform the necessary (purification) with water\nfetched for the purpose (from a tank or river, and with earth). 14\n\n15\\. For a bath water not fetched for the purpose (may also be used). 15\n\n16\\. (For the purpose of purification) a Brahma _n_ a\n\np. 37\n\nshall take earth that is mixed with gravel, from the bank (of a river).\n\n17\\. Five kinds of earth must not be used, viz. such as is covered by water,\nsuch as lies in a temple, on an ant-hill, on a hillock thrown up by rats, and\nthat which has been left by one who cleaned himself.\n\n18\\. The organ (must be cleaned by) one (application of) earth, the (right)\nhand by three, but both (feet) by two, the anus by five, the one (i.e. the\nleft hand) by ten, and both (hands and feet) by seven (applications of earth).\n18\n\n19\\. Such is the purification ordained for house-holders; it is double for\nstudents, treble for hermits, but quadruple for ascetics. 19\n\n20\\. Eight mouthfuls are the meal of an ascetic, sixteen that of a hermit, but\nthirty-two that of a householder, and an unlimited quantity that of a student.\n20\n\n21\\. An Agnihotrin, a draught-ox, and a student, those three can do their work\nonly if they eat (well); without eating (much), they cannot do it.\n\n22\\. (The above rule regarding limited allowances of food holds good) in the\ncase of penances, of self-imposed restraint, of sacrifices, of the recitation\nof the Veda, and of (the performance of other) sacred duties. 22\n\np. 38\n\n23\\. The qualities by which a (true) Brahma _n_ a may be recognised are, the\nconcentration of the mind, austerities, the subjugation of the senses,\nliberality, truthfulness, purity, sacred learning, compassion, worldly\nlearning, intelligence, and the belief (in the existence of the deity and of a\nfuture life).\n\n24\\. One may know that bearing grudges, envy, speaking untruths, speaking evil\nof Brahma _n_ as, backbiting, and cruelty are the characteristics of a _S_\nudra. 24\n\n25\\. Those Brahma _n_ as can save (from evil) who are free from passion, and\npatient of austerities, whose ears have been filled with the texts of the\nVeda, who have subdued the organs of sensation and action, who have ceased to\ninjure animated beings, and who close their hands when gifts are offered. 25\n\n26\\. Some become worthy receptacles of gifts through sacred learning, and some\nthrough the practice of austerities. But that Brahma _n_ a whose stomach does\nnot contain the food of a _S_ udra, is even the worthiest receptacle of all.\n26\n\n27\\. if a Brahma _n_ a dies with the food of a _S_ udra in his stomach, he\nwill become a village pig (in his next life) or be born, in the family of that\n( _S_ udra).\n\n28\\. For though a (Brahma _n_ a) whose body is nourished by the essence of a\n_S_ udra\'s food may\n\np. 39\n\ndaily recite the Veda, though he may offer (an Agnihotra) or mutter (prayers,\nnevertheless) he will not find the path that leads upwards.\n\n29\\. But if, after eating the food of a _S_ udra, he has conjugal intercourse,\nhis sons will belong to the giver of the food, and he shall not ascend to\nheaven.\n\n30\\. They declare that he is worthy to receive gifts, who (daily) rises to\nrecite the Veda, who is of good family, and perfectly free from, passion, who\nconstantly offers. sacrifices in the three sacred fires, who fears sin, and\nknows much, who is beloved among the females (of his family), who is\nrighteous, protects cows, and reduces himself by austerities.\n\n31\\. Just as milk, sour milk, clarified butter, and honey poured. into an\nunburnt earthen vessel, perish, owing to the weakness of the vessel, and\nneither the vessel nor those liquids (remain),\n\n32\\. Even so a man destitute of sacred learning, who accepts cows or gold,\nclothes, a horse, land, (or) sesamum, becomes ashes, as (if he were dry) wood.\n32\n\n33\\. He shall not make his joints or his nails crack, 33\n\n34\\. Nor shall he make a vessel ring with his nails.\n\n35\\. Let him not drink water out of his joined hands. 35\n\n36\\. Let him not strike the water with his foot or his hand,\n\n37\\. Nor (pour) water into (other) water.\n\n38\\. Let him not gather fruit by throwing brickbats,\n\n39\\. Nor by throwing another fruit at it.\n\n40\\. He shall not become a hypocrite or deceitful. 40\n\np. 40\n\n41\\. Let him not learn a language spoken by barbarians.\n\n42\\. Now they quote\' also (the following verses): \'The opinion of the _S_ ish\n_t_ as is, that a man shall not be uselessly active, neither with his hands\nand his feet, nor with his eyes, nor with his tongues and his body.\' 42\n\n43\\. \'Those Brahma _n_ as, in whose families the study of the Veda and of its\nsupplements is hereditary, and who are able to adduce proofs perceptible by\nthe senses from the revealed texts, must be known to be _S_ ish _t_ as.\' 43\n\n44\\. \'He is a (true) Brahma _n_ a regarding whom no one knows if he be good or\nbad, if he be ignorant or deeply learned, if he be of good or of bad conduct.\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[34:1](sbe1409.htm#fr_198) **VI**. Manu IV, 155. The word a _k_ ara, which has\nbeen variously translated by \'conduct,\' \'rule of conduct,\' and \'good conduct,\'\nincludes the observance of all the various rules for every-day life, taught in\nthe Sm _ri_ tis, and the performance of the prescribed ceremonies and rites.\n\n[34:4](sbe1409.htm#fr_199) I read with MSS. Bh. and E., sha _d_ a\xe1\xb9\x85gastvakhila\n_h_ saya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a _h_. The reading of MS. B., which: K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_\n_d_ ita adopts, sha _d_ a\xe1\xb9\x85gah sakhila _h_ means, \'together with the six A\xe1\xb9\x85gas,\n(and) the Khila (spurious) portions of the Veda.\'\n\n[35:5](sbe1409.htm#fr_200) Isha is another name for \xc3\x82 _s_ vina, the month\nSeptember-October. Though the rainy season, properly so called, is over in\nSeptember, still heavy rain falls in many parts of India, chiefly under the\ninfluence of the beginning north-east monsoon, and is particularly important\nfor the Rabi or winter crops. I think, therefore, that it is not advisable to\ntake, as K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita does, yatha ishe \'bda _h_ both with the\nfirst and the second halves of the verse, and to translate, As the clouds (in\ngeneral remain barren) in the month of Isha, even so the texts of the Veda do\nnot save from evil the deceitful man who behaves deceitfully. But that Veda,\ntwo syllables of which have been studied in the right manner, sanctifies, just\nas the clouds in the month of Isha, (which shed a few drops of rain on the day\nof the Svati conjunction, produce pearls)." \'In the right manner,\' i, e, with\nthe due observance of the rules of studentship.\n\n[35:6](sbe1409.htm#fr_201) Identical with Manu IV, 157.\n\n[35:7](sbe1409.htm#fr_202) Manu IV, 156. By the inauspicious marks\' mentioned\nin this verse, and the \'auspicious marks\' occurring in the next, the various\nlines on the hands and feet &c. are meant, the explanation of which forms the\nsubject of the Samudrika _S_ astra.\n\n[35:8](sbe1409.htm#fr_203) Identical with Manu IV, 158; Vish _n_ u LXXI, 92.\n\n[36:10](sbe1409.htm#fr_204) Vish _n_ u LX, 2. I read with the majority of the\nMSS., na rishyati.\n\n[36:11](sbe1409.htm#fr_205) Identical with Manu IV, 52.\n\n[36:12](sbe1409.htm#fr_206) Vish _n_ u LX, 3-22.\n\n[36:13](sbe1409.htm#fr_207) Identical with Manu IV, 51.\n\n[36:14](sbe1409.htm#fr_208) Vish _n_ u LX, 24.\n\n[36:15](sbe1409.htm#fr_209) I.e. one may bathe also in a tank or river.\n\n[37:18](sbe1409.htm#fr_210) Vish _n_ u LX, 25.\n\n[37:19](sbe1409.htm#fr_211) Identical with Vish _n_ u LX, 26, and Manu V, 137.\n\n[37:20](sbe1409.htm#fr_212)-21. Identical with \xc3\x82pastamba II, 5, 9, 13, and S.\n21, with Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khayana, G _ri_ hya-sutra II, 16, 5.\n\n[37:22](sbe1409.htm#fr_213) \'Penances (vrata), i.e. the K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ras\nand the rest; self-imposed restraint (niyama), i.e. eating certain food in\naccordance with a vow, and so forth, during a month or any other fixed period\n. . . . sacred duties (dharma), i.e. giving gifts and the like.\'--K _ri_ sh\n_n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita.\n\n[38:24](sbe1409.htm#fr_214) K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita connects brahma _n_\nadusha _n_ am, translated above by \'speaking evil of Brahma _n_ as,\' with _s_\nudralaksha _n_ am, and renders the two words thus, \'the characteristics of a\n_S_ udra which degrade a Brahma _n_ a.\'\n\n[38:25](sbe1409.htm#fr_215) \'Close their hands,\' i.e. are reluctant to accept.\n\n[38:26](sbe1409.htm#fr_216) K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita takes ki _m_ _k_ it,\ntranslated by \'some,\' to mean \'somewhat,\' \'to a certain degree,\' i.e. neither\nvery distinguished nor very despicable.\n\n[39:32](sbe1409.htm#fr_217) Manu IV, 188.
