The intermediate  \nregion was my father.  \nI saw the Sun both from above and under. I am what Gods  \nin secret hold the highest.  \n10 Agni, associate with the Dames, accordant with the God  \nTvashtar, drink. All-hail!  \nThou art Prajapati, strong male, impregner: may I obtain  \nfrom thee, strong male, impregner, a son who shall himself  \nbecome a father.  \n11 Taken upon a base art thou.  \nThou art bay-coloured, Yoker of Bay Coursers.

Of sin against  \nmankind thou art atonement.  \nFor sin against the Fathers thou atonest. Of sin against  \noneself thou art atonement.  \nOf every sort of sin thou art atonement. The sin that I  \nhave knowingly committed, the sin that unawares I have  \ncommitted, of all that wickedness thou art the atonement.  \n14 We with our bodies have again united, with lustre, vital sap,  \nand happy spirit.  \nGiver of boons, may Tvashtar grant us riches and smooth  \nwhate\xc2\x92er was injured in our body.  \n15 Lead us with thought to wealth in kine, O Indra, to princes,  \nLord of Bounty! and to welfare.  \nLead thou us on to God-inspired devotion, to favour of the  \nGods who merit worship.

All-hail!  \n19 The willing Gods whom, God, thou hast brought hither, send  \nthem to their own dwelling-place, O Agni.  \nAs all of you have eaten and have drunken, approach the  \nair, the heat, the light of heaven.\n\np. 63\n\n20 Here, Agni, as this sacrifice proceedeth, have we elected thee  \nto be our Hotar.  \nSpecial have been thine offerings and thy labour.

Varuna's noose beneath  \nour feet is trampled.  \n24 The waters, face of Agni, have I entered, O Waters\xc2\x92 Child,  \nrepelling evil spirits.  \nOffer the fuel in each home, O Agni.
