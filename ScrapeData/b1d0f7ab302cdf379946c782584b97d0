Then Suke _s_ as Bharadvaga asked him, saying: 'Sir, Hira _n_ yanabha, the\nprince of Kosala 2, came to me and asked this question: Do you know the person\nof sixteen parts, O Bharadvaga? I said to the prince: I do not know him; if I\nknew him, how should I not tell you? Surely, he who speaks what is untrue\nwithers away to the very root; therefore I will not say what is untrue. Then\nhe mounted his chariot and went away silently. Now I ask you, where is that\nperson?'\n\n2\\. He replied: 'Friend, that person is here within the body, he in whom these\nsixteen parts arise.\n\n3\\. He reflected: What is it by whose departure I shall depart, and by whose\nstaying I shall stay?\n\n4\\. He sent forth (created) Pra _n_ a (spirit) 3; from\n\np. 284\n\n[paragraph continues] Pra _n_ a _S_ raddha (faith) 1, ether, air, light,\nwater, earth, sense, mind, food; from food came vigour, penance, hymns,\nsacrifice, the worlds, and in the worlds the name 2 also.\n\n5\\. As these flowing rivers 3 that go towards the ocean, when they have\nreached the ocean, sink into it, their name and form are broken, and people\nspeak of the ocean only, exactly thus these sixteen parts of the spectator\nthat go towards the person (purusha), when they have reached the person, sink\ninto him, their name and form are broken, and people speak of the person only,\nand he becomes without parts and immortal. On this there is this verse:\n\n6\\. That person who is to be known, he in whom these parts rest, like spokes\nin the nave of a wheel, you know him, lest death should hurt you.'\n\n7\\. Then he (Pippalada) said to them: 'So far do I know this Highest Brahman,\nthere is nothing higher than it.'\n\n8\\. And they praising him, said: 'You, indeed, are our father, you who carry\nus from our ignorance to the other shore.'\n\nAdoration to the highest _Ri_ shis!\n\nAdoration to the highest _Ri_ shis!\n\nTat sat.
