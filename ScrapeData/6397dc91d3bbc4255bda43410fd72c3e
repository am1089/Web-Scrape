He then washes the mortar, the pestle, and the winnowing basket, strews to\nthe west of the fire eastward-pointed Darbha grass, and puts (the mortar, &c.)\non (that grass).\n\n2. 2 He then pours out, with a brazen vessel or with the pot in which the oblations of cooked rice are prepared, the grain destined for sacrifice, rice or barley\xc2\x97\n\n3\\. Once pronouncing the name of the deity (to whom the offering will be\nmade): 'Agreeable to such and such (a deity) I pour thee out;' twice (it is\ndone) silently.\n\n4. 4 Then to the west, with his face turned eastward, he begins to husk the grain, with his right hand lying over the left.\n\n5\\. After the grain has three times been winnowed, he should wash it thrice\n(if it is destined) for the gods, they say, twice, if for men, once, if for\nthe Fathers.\n\n6. 6 Having put a (Darbha) purifier (into the pot\n\np. 32\n\nin which the oblation is to be prepared), he should pour the grain (into it).\n\n7\\. He should cook the mess of sacrificial food so that it is well cooked,\nstirring it up (with the pot-ladle) from left to right.\n\n8\\. When it has been cooked, he should sprinkle (\xc3\x82 _g_ ya) on it, should take\nit from the fire towards the north, and should again sprinkle (\xc3\x82 _g_ ya) on\nit.\n\n9\\. Having put wood on the fire, he should strew Ku _s_ a grass round it on\nall sides, to the east, to the south, to the north, to the west\xc2\x97\n\n10. 10 On all sides in three layers or in five layers\xc2\x97\n\n11. 11 Thick, so that always an uneven number (of blades) are put together.\n\n12\\. (He should strew) eastward-pointed grass, covering the roots with the\npoints.\n\n13. 13 Or he should strew it to the west (of the fire), and should draw (some of the grass which he has strewn) from the south end and (some) from the north end, in an easterly direction.\n\n14\\. He should (arrange the grass so as to) lay the points of the southern\nblades uppermost.\n\n15\\. This rule for strewing (grass) round (the fire is valid) for all\n(ceremonies) at which oblations are made.\n\n16. 16 Some lay also branches of _S_ ami wood or of Par _n_ a wood round (the fire).\n\np. 33\n\n17\\. To the north (of the fire) a Sruva full of water (is placed): this is the\nPra _n_ ita water;\n\n18\\. If there is (such water). Or it may be dispensed with, say some\n(teachers).\n\n19\\. Having put the mess of cooked food on the Barhis, and put wood (on the\nfire), he prepares the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya.\n\n20. 20 (He may take) ghee, or oil made from Tila seeds, or curds, or milk, or rice gruel.\n\n21. 21 From that same Barhis (he takes two Darbha blades and) makes purifiers (of them), of the length of one span.\n\n22\\. Putting an herb between (them and the instrument with which he cuts\nthem), he cuts them off, not with his nail, with (the words), 'Purifiers are\nye, sacred to Vish _n_ u.'\n\n23\\. He then wipes them with water, with (the words), 'By Vish _n_ u's mind ye\nare purified.'\n\n24. 24 Having purified (the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya by pouring it into the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya pot, over which he has laid a Darbha purifier), he purifies it (in the pot) with the two northward-pointed purifiers (in the following way):\n\n25\\. Holding them with his two thumbs and fourth fingers, he purifies (the \xc3\x82\n_g_ ya) three times, from west to east, once with the Ya _g_ us: 'May the god\nSavit _ri_ purify thee with this uninjured purifier, with the rays of the good\nsun;' twice silently.\n\np. 34\n\n26\\. He then should sprinkle them with water and should throw them into the\nfire.\n\n27\\. Then, having put that \xc3\x82 _g_ ya on the fire, he should take it from (the\nfire) towards the north.\n\n28\\. This is the way to prepare the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[31:2](sbe30010.htm#fr_148) 7, 2, 3. Khadira-G _ri_ hya II, 1, 9.\n\n[31:4](sbe30010.htm#fr_149) 4, 5. Comp.
