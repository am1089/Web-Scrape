The\nchanging moods of mind are seen, but the witnessing Self, the seer, is never\nseen.\n\nThe eye, remaining one, beholds varying forms; as, blue and yellow, coarse and\nfine, short and long; and differences such as these.\n\nThe mind, remaining one, forms definite intentions, even while the character\nof the eye varies, as in blindness, dullness, or keen-sightedness; and this\nholds also of hearing and touch.\n\nThe conscious Self, remaining one, shines on all the moods of mind: on desire,\ndetermination, doubt, faith, unfaith, firmness and the lack of it, shame,\ninsight, fear, and such as these.\n\nThis conscious Self rises not, nor has its setting, nor does it come to wax or\nwane; unhelped, it shines itself, and illumines others also. [5]\n\n### THE PERSONAL IDEA\n\nThis illumining comes when the ray of consciousness enters the thinking mind;\nand the thinking mind itself is of twofold nature. The one part of it is the\npersonal idea; the other part is mental action.\n\nThe ray of consciousness and the personal idea are blended together, like the\nheat and the hot iron ball. As the personal idea identifies itself with the\nbody, it brings that also a sense of consciousness.\n\nThe personal idea is blended with the ray of consciousness,\n\np. 138\n\nthe body, and the witnessing Self, respectively--through the action of innate\nnecessity, of works, and of delusion.\n\nSince the two are bound up together, the innate blending of the personal idea\nwith the ray of consciousness never ceases; but its blending with the body\nceases, when the works wear out; and with the witnessing Self, through\nillumination.\n\nWhen the personal idea melts away in deep sleep, the body also loses its sense\nof consciousness. The personal idea is only half expanded in dream, while in\nwaking it is complete. [10]\n\nThe power of mental action, when the ray of consciousness has entered into\nunion with it, builds up mind-images in the dream-state; and external objects,\nin the waking state.\n\nThe personal form, thus brought into being by the personal idea and mental\naction, is of itself quite lifeless. It appears in the three modes of\nconsciousness; it is born, and so also dies.\n\n### THE POWERS OF GLAMOR\n\nFor the world-glamor has two powers--extension and limitation, or enveloping.\nThe power of extension brings into manifestation the whole world, from the\npersonal form to the universal cosmos.\n\nThis manifesting is an attributing of name and form to the Reality--which is\nBeing, Consciousness, Bliss, the Eternal; it is like foam on the water.\n\nThe inner division between the seer and the seen, and the outer division\nbetween the Eternal and the world,\n\np. 139\n\nare concealed by the other power, limitation; and this also is the cause of\nthe cycle of birth and death. [15]\n\nThe light of the witnessing Self is united with the personal form; from this\nentering in of the ray of consciousness arises the habitual life--the ordinary\nself.\n\nThe isolated existence of the ordinary self is attributed to the witnessing\nSelf, and appears to belong to it; but when the power of limitation is\ndestroyed, and the difference appears, the sense of isolation in the Self\nvanishes away.\n\nIt is the same power which conceals the difference between the Eternal and the\nvisible world; and, by its power, the Eternal appears subject to change.\n\nBut when this power of limitation is destroyed, the difference between the\nEternal and the visible world becomes clear; change belongs to the visible\nworld, and by no means to the Eternal.\n\nThe five elements of existence are these: being, shining, enjoying, form and\nname; the three first belong to the nature of the Eternal; the last two, to\nthe nature of the visible world. [20]\n\nIn the elements--ether, air, fire, water, earth; in creatures--gods, animals,\nand men, Being, Consciousness, Bliss are undivided; the division is only of\nname and form.\n\n### SIX STEPS OF SOUL VISION\n\nTherefore setting aside this division through name and form, and concentrating\nhimself on Being, Consciousness, Bliss, which are undivided, let him follow\nafter soul-vision perpetually, first inwardly in the heart, and then in\noutward things also.\n\np. 140\n\nSoul-vision is either fluctuating or unwavering; this is its two-fold division\nin the heart. Fluctuating soul-vision is again two-fold; it may consist either\nin things seen or heard.\n\nThis is the fluctuating soul-vision which consists in things seen: a\nmeditating on consciousness as being merely the witness of the desires and\npassions that fill the mind.\n\nThis is the fluctuating soul-vision which consists in things heard: the\nconstant thought that "I am the self, which is unattached, Being,\nConsciousness, Bliss, self shining, secondless." [25]\n\nThe forgetting of all images and words, through entering into the bliss of\ndirect experience--this is unwavering soul-vision, like a lamp set in a\nwindless place.\n\nThen, corresponding to the first, there is the soul-vision which strips off\nname and form from the element of pure Being, in everything whatever; now\naccomplished outwardly, as it was before, in the heart.\n\nAnd, corresponding to the second is the soul-vision which consists in the\nunbroken thought, that the Real is a single undivided Essence, whose character\nis Being, Consciousness, Bliss.\n\nCorresponding to the former third, is that steady being, is the tasting of\nthis Essence for oneself. Let him fill the time by following out these, the\nsix stages of soul-vision.\n\nWhen the false conceit, that the body is the Self, falls away; when the Self\nsupreme is known; then, whithersoever the mind is directed, there will the\npowers of soul-vision arise. [30] The knot of the heart is loosed; all doubts\nare cut;\n\np. 141\n\nall bondage to works wither away--when That is known, which is the first and\nthe last.\n\n### THE THREE SELVES\n\nThe individual self appears in three degrees: as a limitation of the Self; as\na ray of the conscious Self; and, thirdly, as the self imagined in dreams. The\nfirst alone is real.\n\nFor the limitation in the individual self is a mere imagination; and that\nwhich is supposed to be limited is the Reality, The idea of isolation in the\nindividual self is only an error; but its identity with the Eternal is its\nreal nature.\n\nAnd that song they sang of "That thou art" is for the first of these three\nselves alone; it only is one with the perfect Eternal, not the other selves.\n\nThe power of world-glamor, existing in the Eternal, has two potencies:\nextension and limitation. Through the power of limitation, Glamor hides the\nundivided nature of the Eternal, and so builds up the images of the individual\nself and the world. [35]\n\nThe individual self which comes into being when the ray of consciousness\nenters the thinking mind, is the self that gains experience and performs\nworks. The whole world, with all its elements and beings, is the object of its\nexperience.\n\nThese two, the individual self and its world, were before time began; they\nlast till Freedom comes, making up our habitual life. Hence they are called\nthe habitual self and world.\n\nIn this ray of consciousness, the dream-power exists,\n\np. 142\n\nwith its two potencies of extension and limitation. Through the power of\nlimitation, it hides the former self and world, and so builds up a new self\nand a new world.\n\nAs this new self and world are real only so long as their appearance lasts,\nthey are called the imaginary self and the imaginary world. For, when one has\nawakened from the dream, the dream existence never comes back again.\n\nThe imaginary self believes its imaginary world to be real; but the habitual\nself knows that world to be only mythical, as also is the imaginary self.\n\nThe habitual self looks on its habitual world as real, but the real Self knows\nthat the habitual world is only mythical, as also is the habitual self.\n\nThe real Self knows its real oneness with the Eternal it sees nothing but the\nEternal, yet sees that what seemed the unreal is also the Self.\n\n### FREEDOM AND FINAL PEACE\n\nAs the sweetness, the flowing, and the coldness, that are the characteristics\nof the water, reappear in the wave, and so in the foam that crests the wave;\n\nSo, verily, the Being, Consciousness, and Bliss of the witnessing Self enter\ninto the habitual self that is bound up with it; and, by the door of the\nhabitual self, enter into the imaginary self also.\n\nBut when the foam melts away, its flowing, sweetness, coldness, all sink back\ninto the wave; and when the wave itself comes to rest, they sink back to the\nsea.\n\nWhen the imaginary self melts away, its Being, Consciousness, Bliss sink back\ninto the habitual self; and, when the habitual self comes to rest, they return\nto the Self supreme, the witness of all.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Teachings of \xc5\x9aankara](cjw20.htm)\n\n'
