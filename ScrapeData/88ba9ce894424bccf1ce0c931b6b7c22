The poets rightly teach that Sannyas  \nIs the foregoing of all acts which spring  \nOut of desire; and their wisest say  \nTyaga is renouncing fruit of acts.\n\nThere be among the saints some who have held  \nAll action sinful, and to be renounced;  \nAnd some who answer, "Nay! the goodly acts-  \nAs worship, penance, alms- must be performed!"  \nHear now My sentence, Best of Bharatas!\n\n\'Tis well set forth, O Chaser of thy Foes!  \nRenunciation is of threefold form,  \nAnd Worship, Penance, Alms, not to be stayed;  \nNay, to be gladly done; for all those three  \nAre purifying waters for true souls!\n\nYet must be practised even those high works  \nIn yielding up attachment, and all fruit  \nProduced by works. This is My judgment, Prince!  \nThis My insuperable and fixed decree!\n\nAbstaining from a work by right prescribed  \nNever is meet! So to abstain doth spring  \nFrom "Darkness," and Delusion teacheth it.  \nAbstaining from a work grievous to flesh,  \nWhen one saith "\'Tis unpleasing!" this is null!  \nSuch an one acts from "passion;" nought of gain  \nWins his Renunciation! But, Arjun!  \nAbstaining from attachment to the work,  \nAbstaining from rewardment in the work,  \nWhile yet one doeth it full faithfully,  \nSaying, "\'Tis right to do!" that is "true" act  \nAnd abstinence! Who doeth duties so,  \nUnvexed if his work fail, if it succeed  \nUnflattered, in his own heart justified,  \nQuit of debates and doubts, his is "true" act:  \nFor, being in the body, none may stand  \nWholly aloof from act; yet, who abstains  \nFrom profit of his acts is abstinent.\n\nThe fruit of labours, in the fives to come,  \nIs threefold for all men,- Desirable,  \nAnd Undesirable, and mixed of both;  \nBut no fruit is at all where no work was.\n\nHear from me, Long-armed Lord! the makings five  \nWhich go to every act, in Sankhya taught  \nAs necessary. First the force; and then  \nThe agent; next, the various instruments;  \nFourth, the especial effort; fifth, the God.  \nWhat work soever any mortal doth  \nOf body, mind, or speech, evil or good,  \nBy these five doth he that. Which being thus,  \nWhoso, for lack of knowledge, seeth himself  \nAs the sole actor, knoweth nought at all  \nAnd seeth nought. Therefore, I say, if one-  \nHolding aloof from self- with unstained mind  \nShould slay all yonder host, being bid to slay,  \nHe doth not slay; he is not bound thereby!\n\nKnowledge, the thing known, and the mind which knows,  \nThese make the threefold starting-ground of act.  \nThe act, the actor, and the instrument,  \nThese make the threefold total of the deed.  \nBut knowledge, agent, act, are differenced  \nBy three dividing qualities. Hear now  \nWhich be the qualities dividing them.\n\nThere is "true" Knowledge. Learn thou it is this:  \nTo see one changeless Life in all the Lives,  \nAnd in the Separate, One Inseparable.  \nThere is imperfect Knowledge: that which sees  \nThe separate existences apart,  \nAnd, being separated, holds them real.  \nThere is false Knowledge: that which blindly clings  \nTo one as if \'twere all, seeking no Cause,  \nDeprived of light, narrow, and dull, and "dark."\n\nThere is "right" Action: that which- being enjoined-  \nIs wrought without attachment, passionlessly,  \nFor duty, not for love, nor hate, nor gain.  \nThere is "vain" Action: that which men pursue  \nAching to satisfy desires, impelled  \nBy sense of self, with all-absorbing stress:  \nThis is of Rajas- passionate and vain.  \nThere is "dark" Action: when one doth a thing  \nHeedless of issues, heedless of the hurt  \nOr wrong for others, heedless if he harm  \nHis own soul- \'tis of Tamas, black and bad!\n\nThere is the "rightful" doer. He who acts  \nFree from self-seeking, humble, resolute,  \nSteadfast, in good or evil hap the same,  \nContent to do aright- he "truly" acts.  \nThere is th\' "impassioned" doer. He that works  \nFrom impulse, seeking profit, rude and bold  \nTo overcome, unchastened; slave by turns  \nOf sorrow and of joy: of Rajas he!  \nAnd there be evil doers; loose of heart,  \nLow-minded, stubborn, fraudulent, remiss,  \nDull, slow, despondent- children of the "dark."\n\nHear, too, of Intellect and Steadfastness  \nThe threefold separation, Conqueror-Prince!  \nHow these are set apart by Qualities.\n\nGood is the Intellect which comprehends  \nThe coming forth and going back of life,  \nWhat must be done, and what must not be done,  \nWhat should be feared, and what should not be feared,  \nWhat binds and what emancipates the soul:  \nThat is of Sattwan, Prince! of "soothfastness."  \nMarred is the Intellect which, knowing right  \nAnd knowing wrong, and what is well to do  \nAnd what must not be done, yet understands  \nNought with firm mind, nor as the calm truth is:  \nThis is of Rajas, Prince! and "passionate!"  \nEvil is Intellect which, wrapped in gloom,  \nLooks upon wrong as right, and sees all things  \nContrariwise of Truth. O Pritha\'s Son!  \nThat is of Tamas, "dark" and desperate!\n\nGood is the steadfastness whereby a man  \nMasters his beats of heart, his very breath  \nOf life, the action of his senses; fixed  \nIn never-shaken faith and piety:  \nThat is of Sattwan, Prince! "soothfast" and fair!  \nStained is the steadfastness whereby a man  \nHolds to his duty, purpose, effort, end,  \nFor life\'s sake, and the love of goods to gain,  \nArjuna! \'tis of Raias, passion-stamped!  \nSad is the steadfastness wherewith the fool  \nCleaves to his sloth, his sorrow, and his fears,  \nHis folly and despair. This- Pritha\'s Son!-  \nIs born of Tamas, "dark" and miserable!\n\nHear further, Chief of Bharatas! from Me  \nThe threefold kinds of Pleasure which there be.\n\nGood Pleasure is the pleasure that endures,  \nBanishing pain for aye; bitter at first  \nAs poison to the soul, but afterward  \nSweet as the taste of Amrit. Drink of that!  \nIt springeth in the Spirit\'s deep content.  \nAnd painful Pleasure springeth from the bond  \nBetween the senses and the sense-world. Sweet  \nAs Amrit is its first taste, but its last  \nBitter as poison. \'Tis of Rajas, Prince!  \nAnd foul and "dark" the Pleasure is which springs  \nFrom sloth and sin and foolishness; at first  \nAnd at the last, and all the way of life  \nThe soul bewildering. \'Tis of Tamas, Prince!\n\nFor nothing lives on earth, nor \'midst the gods  \nIn utmost heaven, but hath its being bound  \nWith these three Qualities, by Nature framed.\n\nThe work of Brahmans, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas,  \nAnd Sudras, O thou Slayer of thy Foes!  \nIs fixed by reason of the Qualities  \nPlanted in each:  \nA Brahman\'s virtues, Prince  \nBorn of his nature, are serenity,  \nSelf-mastery, religion, purity,  \nPatience, uprightness, learning, and to know  \nThe truth of things which be. A Kshatriya\'s pride,  \nBorn of his nature, lives in valour, fire,  \nConstancy, skilfulness, spirit in fight,  \nAnd open-handedness and noble mien,  \nAs of a lord of men. A Vaisya\'s task,  \nBorn with his nature, is to till the ground,  \nTend cattle, venture trade. A Sudra\'s state,  \nSuiting his nature, is to minister.\n\nWhoso performeth- diligent, content-  \nThe work allotted him, whate\'er it be,  \nLays hold of perfectness! Hear how a man  \nFindeth perfection, being so content:  \nHe findeth it through worship- wrought by work-  \nOf HIM that is the Source of all which lives,  \nOf HIM by Whom the universe was stretched.\n\nBetter thine own work is, though done with fault,  \nThan doing others\' work, ev\'n excellently.  \nHe shall not fall in sin who fronts the task  \nSet him by Nature\'s hand! Let no man leave  \nHis natural duty, Prince! though it bear blame!  \nFor every work hath blame, as every flame  \nIs wrapped in smoke! Only that man attains  \nPerfect surcease of work whose work was wrought  \nWith mind unfettered, soul wholly subdued,  \nDesires for ever dead, results renounced.\n\nLearn from me, Son of Kunti! also this,  \nHow one, attaining perfect peace, attains  \nBRAHM, the supreme, the highest height of all!\n\nDevoted- with a heart grown pure, restrained  \nIn lordly self-control, forgoing wiles  \nOf song and senses, freed from love and hate,  \nDwelling \'mid solitudes, in diet spare,  \nWith body, speech, and will tamed to obey,  \nEver to holy meditation vowed,  \nFrom passions liberate, quit of the Self,  \nOf arrogance, impatience, anger, pride;  \nFreed from surroundings, quiet, lacking nought-  \nSuch an one grows to oneness with the BRAHM;  \nSuch an one, growing one with BRAHM, serene,  \nSorrows no more, desires no more; his soul,  \nEqually loving all that lives, loves well  \nMe, Who have made them, and attains to Me.  \nBy this same love and worship doth he know  \nMe as I am, how high and wonderful,  \nAnd knowing, straightway enters into Me.  \nAnd whatsoever deeds he doeth- fixed  \nIn Me, as in his refuge- he hath won  \nFor ever and for ever by My grace  \nTh\' Eternal Rest! So win thou! In thy thoughts  \nDo all thou dost for Me! Renounce for Me!  \nSacrifice heart and mind and will to Me!  \nLive in the faith of Me! In faith of Me  \nAll dangers thou shalt vanquish, by My grace;  \nBut, trusting to thyself and heeding not,  \nThou can\'st but perish! If this day thou say\'st,  \nRelying on thyself, "I will not fight!"  \nVain will the purpose prove! thy qualities  \nWould spur thee to the war. What thou dost shun,  \nMisled by fair illusions, thou wouldst seek  \nAgainst thy will, when the task comes to thee  \nWaking the promptings in thy nature set.  \nThere lives a Master in the hearts of men  \nMaketh their deeds, by subtle pulling-strings,  \nDance to what tune HE will. With all thy soul  \nTrust Him, and take Him for thy succour, Prince!  \nSo- only so, Arjuna!- shalt thou gain-  \nBy grace of Him- the uttermost repose,  \nThe Eternal Place!  \nThus hath been opened thee  \nThis Truth of Truths, the Mystery more hid  \nThan any secret mystery. Meditate!  \nAnd- as thou wilt- then act!\n\nNay! but once more  \nTake My last word, My utmost meaning have!  \nPrecious thou art to Me; right well-beloved!  \nListen! tell thee for thy comfort this.  \nGive Me thy heart! adore Me! serve Me! cling  \nIn faith and love and reverence to Me!  \nSo shalt thou come to Me! I promise true,  \nFor thou art sweet to Me!  \nAnd let go those-  \nRites and writ duties! Fly to Me alone!  \nMake Me thy single refuge! will free  \nThy soul from all its sins! Be of good cheer!\n\n[Hide, the holy Krishna saith,  \nThis from him that hath no faith,  \nHim that worships not, nor seeks  \nWisdom\'s teaching when she speaks:  \nHide it from all men who mock;  \nBut, wherever, \'mid the flock  \nOf My lovers, one shall teach  \nThis divinest, wisest, speech-  \nTeaching in the faith to bring  \nTruth to them, and offering  \nOf all honour unto Me-  \nUnto Brahma cometh he!  \nNay, and nowhere shall ye find  \nAny man of all mankind  \nDoing dearer deed for Me;  \nNor shall any dearer be  \nIn My earth. Yea, furthermore,  \nWhoso reads this converse o\'er,  \nHeld by Us upon the plain,  \nPondering piously and fain,  \nHe hath paid Me sacrifice!  \n(Krishna speaketh in this wise!)  \nYea, and whoso, full of faith,  \nHeareth wisely what it saith,  \nHeareth meekly,- when he dies,  \nSurely shall his spirit rise  \nTo those regions where the Blest,  \nFree of flesh, in joyance rest.]\n\nHath this been heard by thee, O Indian Prince!  \nWith mind intent? hath all the ignorance-  \nWhich bred thy trouble- vanished, My Arjun?  \nArjuna. Trouble and ignorance are gone! the Light  \nHath come unto me, by Thy favour, Lord!  \nNow am I fixed! my doubt is fled away!  \nAccording to Thy word, so will I do!\n\n_Sanjaya._ Thus gathered I the gracious speech of Krishna, O my  \nKing!  \nThus have I told, with heart a-thrill, this wise and wondrous thing  \nBy great Vyasa\'s learning writ, how Krishna\'s self made known  \nThe Yoga, being Yoga\'s Lord. So is the high truth shown!  \nAnd aye, when I remember, O Lord my King, again  \nArjuna and the God in talk, and all this holy strain,  \nGreat is my gladness: when I muse that splendour, passing speech,  \nOf Hari, visible and plain, there is no tongue to reach  \nMy marvel and my love and bliss. O Archer-Prince! all hail!  \nO Krishna, Lord of Yoga! surely there shall not fail  \nBlessing, and victory, and power, for Thy most mighty sake,  \nWhere this song comes of Arjun, and how with God he spake.\n\nHERE ENDS, WITH CHAPTER XVIII,  \nEntitled "Mokshasanyasayog,"  \nOr "The Book of Religion by Deliverance and Renunciation,"  \nTHE BHAGAVAD-GITA.  \nTHE END\n\n'
