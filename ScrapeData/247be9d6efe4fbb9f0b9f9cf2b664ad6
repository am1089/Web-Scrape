(2)\n\nHim, Who is all-knowing, Who is indeed all and perfect, Who is bliss itself,\nWho resides in the qualities * and has therefore endless attributes, Who is\nthe Unmanifest that differentiates the undifferentiated, and Who is both the\nreal\n\np. 3\n\nand the unreal,--that Hari, the destroyer of the darkness of _sams ara_, I\npraise. (3)\n\nThere is naught else than Him; yet, this universe is not his real nature. He\nis not the objective world, for He is of the nature of nonobjective\nconsciousness. And though He is devoid of the distinction of the knower,\nknowledge and the known, He is nevertheless always the knower,--that Hari, the\ndestroyer of the darkness of _sams ara_, I praise. (4)\n\nHim Who is realised as the Supreme Lord by those who, having learnt from\nproper preceptors the extremely subtle nature of the\n\np. 4\n\n[paragraph continues] Immutable, are engaged in the contemplation of the\nultimate Unity with the help of renunciation, constant meditation and firm\ndevotion,--that Hari, the destroyer of the darkness of _sams ara_, I praise.\n(5)\n\nHim Who is realised as "I am the self-resplendent Self" when, by the control\nof the life-forces, the mind is confined within the heart amidst the\nrepetition of the sound Om and, all other memory being excluded, is merged\ntherein and is finally dissolved,--that Hari, the destroyer of the darkness of\n_sams ara_, I praise. (6)\n\np. 5\n\nHim Whom the knowers of Brahman realise by meditation as the Supreme Lord\nwithin themselves known as Brahman, as the second-less, infinite, unborn,\nsubtle, inscrutable Resplendence residing in the heart and attainable only by\ndevotees,--that Hari, the destroyer of the darkness of _sams ara_, I praise.\n(7)\n\nHim Who is understood as the unsurpassable bliss realisable only by the spirit\nby those who perceive within their own hearts That which is beyond the senses,\nbeing realisable only by the expansion of the individual self, and beyond the\ncognisable, being cognition itself,--that Hari, the destroyer of the darkness\nof _sams ara_, I praise. (8)\n\np. 6\n\nHim Whom, the Unborn, sages like Sanaka meditate upon by understanding that\nevery object of perception has an underlying reality and is identical with\nBrahman and by realising "I am That",--that Hari, the destroyer of the\ndarkness of _sams ara_, I praise. (9)\n\nHim Whom the knowers of the Self know as the Supreme Lord "in whom I am" by\neliminating as not-I whatever is perceptible, and by realising that bliss\nwhich is self- resplendent consciousness,--that Hari, the destroyer of the\ndarkness of _sams ara_, I praise. (10)\n\np. 7\n\nHim in Whom the devotees of the Immutable, forsaking their bodies, merge\nthemselves by realising Him as the pure self-resplendent Self, infinite like\nspace, as That which alone remains when all that is cognisable and\ndifferentiated is eliminated step by step,--that Hari, the destroyer of the\ndarkness of _sams ara_, I praise. (11)\n\nHim Who is in all, Whose body is this all, and yet Who is not this all, Who\nknows all, but Whom none knows at all, and Who, as stated above, holds all\nthis together, being the inner spirit thereof,--that Hari, the destroyer of\nthe darkness of _sams ara_, I praise. (12)\n\np. 8\n\nHim Who is realised as "I am the One that is the All" by those who see, by\ntheir reason, all this universe as existing within themselves and their own\nself as the Unborn residing in the heart of all beings,--that Hari, the\ndestroyer of the darkness of _sams ara_, I praise. (13)\n\nHim Who is described by some as the One in all beings that sees and smells and\ntastes and touches and hears and knows, and by others as the witness that is\nthe seer in all doers,--that Hari, the destroyer of the darkness of _sams\nara_, I praise. (14)\n\np. 9\n\nHim Who is realised as the Supreme Lord, the Self that is the knower of\nobjects, Who sees and hears and tastes and smells and knows and holds this\nbody together as the individual self therein,--that Hari, the destroyer of the\ndarkness of _sams ara_, I praise. (15)\n\nHe Who sees objects of gross matter in the waking state, illusion in dream,\nand blissful repose in deep sleep and Himself in the fourth state and is\nhappy,--that Hari, the destroyer of the darkness of _sams ara_, I praise. (16)\n\np. 10\n\nHim Who, though pure, imperishable, one and unborn, nevertheless imposes upon\nHimself * different qualities and different shapes and, like a crystal \xe2\x80\xa0,\nshines variegated, differentiated and hidden by the fruits of action--that\nHari, the destroyer of the darkness of _sams ara_, I praise. (17)\n\nHim Who is the one Reality, but Who owing to the diversity of intellects, is\nconventionally spoken of in various ways as Brahman, Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u, Rudra, Fire, the\nSun, the Moon, Indra, Vayu (the God of Wind), and sacrifice,--that Hari, the\ndestroyer of the darkness of _sams ara_, I praise. (18)\n\np. 11\n\nHim, the Unborn, Whom, at the beginning of the Taittiriya-Upanishad, Varu\xe1\xb9\x87a\nexplained to Bh\xe1\xb9\x9bigu * as being uncontradictable, conscious,. pure,\nimperishable, transcendental, unperturbed, unperceivable, without parts,\nblissful, and without a second,--that Hari, the destroyer of the darkness of\n_sams ara_, I praise. (19),\n\nHim Whom, as stated at the end of the Taittiriya-Upanishad, Bh\xe1\xb9\x9bigu, taught by\nhis father, realised as the witness in everything after having determined\nwithin. himself "I am\n\np. 12\n\nthe Brahman beyond these five sheaths of taste, etc. *",--that Hari, the\ndestroyer of the darkness of _sams ara_, I praise. (20)\n\nHim by Whose inspiration, by Whose power, \xe2\x80\xa0 and on Whom depending, the knower\nof the field \xe2\x80\xa1 directs the active principle in all creatures, and by Whose\npower ** is impelled the self that is the doer and enjoyer in this world,--\nthat Hari, the destroyer of the darkness of _sams ara_, I praise. (21)\n\np. 13\n\nHim, the one Supreme Self, Who created all this indescribable universe and Who\nfully permeates every part of that creation, being identical therewith, and\nthus becomes all that is manifest and unmanifest,--that Hari, the destroyer of\nthe darkness of _sams ara_, I praise. (22)\n\nHim Whom, by the help of the Vedantas, the sciences treating of the self, the\nPuranas, the cults of Vishnu-worship and other sciences, many have realised as\nthe Supreme Lord within their own selves and, knowing thus, have merged\nthemselves into Him,--that Hari, the destroyer of the darkness of _sams ara_,\nI praise. (23)\n\np. 14\n\nHim, the resplendent Lord, Who is speedily realisable even in this world by\nthose who strive to seek him by means of faith, devotion, meditation, self-\ncontrol and other expedients, but Who is hard to realise even through hundreds\nof lives for those who are devoid of those expedients,--that Hari, the\ndestroyer of the darkness of _sams ara_, I praise. (24)\n\nHim, the indescribable glory . of Whose manifestation has been defined by the\nVedic seers in the passage "All this indeed is Brahman", that is, all this,\nbeing born of Him, being in Him and dissolving in Him, is identical with Him,\nlike the waves of the ocean,--that Hari, the destroyer of the darkness of\n_sams ara_, I praise. (25)\n\np. 15\n\nHim Who is realised by intense devotion as the unborn and indestructible\nprinciple, the pure intelligence residing as Witness in the heart, and by\nmeditating "I am in Him", as taught in the Gita and in the manner laid down\ntherein,--that Hari, the destroyer of the darkness of _sams ara_, I praise.\n(26)\n\nHim, the Infinite, Who, assuming the condition of the individual self and\ndwelling in nature, incessantly enjoys the objects of enjoyment through the\nfive gateways of the senses, and Who, though one, appears as different in\ndifferent bodies like the moon reflected in the\n\np. 16\n\nwaters,--that Hari, the destroyer of the darkness of _sams ara_, I praise.\n(27)\n\nHim Who is named Purusha and Who is realised, even in this world, as "He who\nis I is that Supreme Lord and I am verily He" by those who intelligently\ninvestigate the teachings of Vyasa * and understand the distinction between\nthe field and the knower of the field, \xe2\x80\xa0--that Hari, the destroyer of the\ndarkness of _sams ara_, I praise. (28)\n\np. 17\n\nHim, the conscious principle residing in innumerable bodies, Whose oneness\nrealising, men speedily become Himself in this very life, and; in Whom merged,\nthey come no more to birth in this world,--that Hari, the destroyer of the\ndarkness of _sams ara_, I praise. (29)\n\nHim Who is realised as "He that is the Supreme Lord is I and I am verily He"\nby those who understand the unity in duality taught by the passages of the\nMadhu-Brahma\xe1\xb9\x87a * and attain a supremacy that exacts veneration even at the\nhands of Indra,--that Hari, the destroyer of the darkness of _sams ara_, I\npraise. (30)\n\np. 18\n\nHim Who is realised as the Supreme Lord by those who meditate on the unity of\nthe Self, as "He that, dwelling in the mind, impels the body to action, He too\nthat, residing in the sun, causes him to -radiate heat, I am verily He,"--that\nHari, the destroyer of the darkness of _sams ara_, I praise. (31)\n\nHim, the ultimate reality, a spark of Whose consciousness reflected in nature\n* cognises the objects of cognition outside the mind, but does not cognise Him\nthat dwells within the mind and inspires the cognition,--that Hari, the\ndestroyer of the darkness of _sams ara_, I praise. (32)\n\np. 19\n\nHim Who is realised as "I am that conscious principle in this body" by those\nwho intelligently enquire "Who is this Shining One in the body?" and determine\nthat this Shining One is indeed the knower, the hearer and the thinker,--that\nHari, the destroyer of the darkness of _sams ara_, I praise. (33)\n\nWho indeed can live, if He do not reside in the body? He alone, therefore, is\nthe Supreme Bliss and He is the incoming and outgoing life. By such reasoning\ndoes the Scripture * declare that He is,--that Hari, the destroyer of the\ndarkness of _sams ara_, I praise. (34)\n\np. 20\n\n"Am I the vital energy *? Or speech? Or the senses of hearing etc? Or the mind\n\xe2\x80\xa0? Or the intellect? \xe2\x80\xa1 Am I a particular entity or the collective whole?" Him\nWho, by thus meditating, is realised as "I am the conscious principle in this\nbody",--that Hari, the destroyer of the darkness of _sams ara_, I praise. (35)\n\nHim Who is realised as "I am not the vital energy *, nor the body, nor the\nmind \xe2\x80\xa0, nor the intellect \xe2\x80\xa1, nor the ego \xc2\xa7, nor the understanding **, but am\nverily He that is the\n\np. 21\n\nconscious principle in this body,"--that Hari, the destroyer of the darkness\nof _sams ara_, I praise. (36)\n\nHim Whom, in the Upanishad of the Samaveda *, the father \xe2\x80\xa0 explains to his son\n\xe2\x80\xa1 as pure existence, pure consciousness, the unborn, the real, the\ntranscendental, the eternal, the infinite, the first cause, and by declaring\n"That thou art",--that Hari, the destroyer of the darkness of _sams ara_, I\npraise. (37)\n\nHim Who is realised as the ultimate reality by those who, through perfect\nabsorption of\n\np. 22\n\nthought *, attain to the knowledge of the conscious principle within\nthemselves by first excluding all conditioned and unconditioned existence and\nthen eliminating all that is perceptible as "Not this" "Not this,"--that Hari,\nthe destroyer of the darkness of _sams ara_, I praise. (38)\n\nHim Who is the warp and woof of the web of this universe including the\nundifferentiated ether, Who is established under the designation of the\nIndestructible in such passages as "It is not gross, It is not atomic etc.",\nWho can only be understood as "There is no knower but He", but Who is not the\nobject of cognition,--that Hari, the destroyer of the darkness of _sams ara_,\nI praise. (39)\n\np. 23\n\nHim, the Knower, without realising Whom within one\'s self as "I am He", all\nthis appears as real, but, Who being realised, all this becomes unreal,--that\nHari, the destroyer of the darkness of _sams ara_, I praise. (40)\n\nHim Who is realised as the consciousness that ultimately remains when the self\nthat is not free from impurity is burnt in the fire of knowledge. kindled by\neightfold Yoga *, like gold alloyed with iron in the furnace,--that Hari, the\ndestroyer of the darkness of _sams ara_, I praise. (41)\n\np. 24\n\nHim Who is the resplendent light of consciousness, the first cause, the\npraiseworthy, Who shines like lightning within the heart amidst the spheres of\nthe sun, moon and fire, * in Whom the sages, worshipping Him with devotion as\nthe ultimate reality within their own selves, merge themselves even in this\nlife,--that Hari, the destroyer of the darkness of _sams ara_, I praise. (42)\n\nMay He, the all-pervading (Vishnu), protect this devotee who is an individual\nself \xe2\x80\xa0 existing\n\np. 25\n\nin Himself, considering "This devotee praises Me Who am the essence of all\norgans with constant devotion and single-mindedness and withdrawing himself\nwithin his own self"--that Hari, the destroyer of the darkness of _sams ara_,\nI praise. (43)\n\nHe who recites or hears this. hymn of the venerable teacher, valuable to\ndevotees and resembling the sun in dispelling the darkness of the fear of\n_sams ara_, attains the state of the All-pervading (Vishnu) and; becoming a\nseer, realises both knowledge and the object of knowledge * within himself.\n(44)\n\nThus ends the hymn to Hari.\n\n_________\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1:*](wos03.htm#fr_0) Phenomenal existence; the succession of births and\ndeaths.\n\n[2:*](wos03.htm#fr_1) Sattva, Rajas and Tamas.\n\n[10:*](wos03.htm#fr_2) Lit: Sees.\n\n[10:\xe2\x80\xa0](wos03.htm#fr_3) Reflecting external colours.\n\n[11:*](wos03.htm#fr_4) Son of Varu\xe1\xb9\x87a.\n\n[12:*](wos03.htm#fr_5) The five _kosas_ , namely, annamaya, pra\xe1\xb9\x87amaya,\nmanomaya, vij\xe1\xb9\x87anamaya and anandamaya.\n\n[12:\xe2\x80\xa0](wos03.htm#fr_6) Maya-\xe1\xb9\xa3akti, the power of illusion.\n\n[12:\xe2\x80\xa1](wos03.htm#fr_7) Kshetraj\xe1\xb9\x87a, the individual conscious self.\n\n[12:**](wos03.htm#fr_8) Chit-\xe1\xb9\xa3akti, the power of intelligence.\n\n[16:*](wos03.htm#fr_9) The Brahma-Sutras of Vyasa.\n\n[16:\xe2\x80\xa0](wos03.htm#fr_10) Kshetra, the field or the body, and Kshetraj\xe1\xb9\x87a, the\nknower of the field or the individual self.\n\n[17:*](wos03.htm#fr_11) B\xe1\xb9\x9bih.
