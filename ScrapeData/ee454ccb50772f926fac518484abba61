Next comes the Sudadohas 1 verse. Sudadohas is breath, and thereby he\njoins all joints with breath.\n\n2\\. Next follow the neck verses. They recite them as Ush _n_ ih, according to\ntheir metre 2.\n\n3\\. Next comes (again) the Sudadohas verse. Sudadohas is breath, and thereby\nhe joins all joints with breath.\n\n4\\. Next follows the head. That is in Gayatri verses. The Gayatri is the\nbeginning of all metres 3; the head the first of all members. It is in Arkavat\nverses (Rv. I, 7, 1-9) 4. Arka is Agni. They are nine verses. The head\nconsists of nine pieces. He recites the tenth verse, and that is the skin and\nthe hairs on the head. It serves for reciting one verse more than (the nine\nverses contained in) the Stoma 5.\n\np. 188\n\n[paragraph continues] These form the Trivrit Stoma and the Gayatri metre, and\nwhatever there exists, all this is produced after the production of this Stoma\nand this metre. Therefore the recitation of these head-hymns serves for\nproduction.\n\n5\\. He who knows this, gets offspring and cattle.\n\n6\\. Next comes the Sudadohas verse. Verily, Sudadohas is breath, and thereby\nhe joins all joints with breath.\n\n7\\. Next follow the vertebrae 1 (of the bird). These verses are Vira _g_\n(shining). Therefore man says to man, 'Thou shinest above us;' or to a stiff\nand proud man, 'Thou carriest thy neck stiff.' Or because the (vertebrae of\nthe neck) run close together, they are taken to be the best food. For Vira _g_\n, is food, and food is strength.\n\n8\\. Next comes the Sudadohas verse. Sudadohas is breath, and thereby he joins\nall joints with breath.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[187:1](sbe01196.htm#fr_462) The Nishkevalya- _s_ astra is represented in the\nshape of a bird, consisting of trunk, neck, head, vertebrae, wings, tail, and\nstomach. Before describing the hymns which form the neck, another hymn has to\nbe mentioned, called Sudadohas, which has to be recited at the end of the\nhymns, described before, which form the trunk. Sudadohas is explained as\n'yielding milk,' and because that word occurs in the verse, the verse is\ncalled Sudadohas. It follows on the Nada verse, Rv. VIII, 69, 3. Cf. Ait. \xc3\x82r.\nI, 5, 1, 7.\n\n[187:2](sbe01196.htm#fr_463) They occur in another _s_ akha, and are to be\nrecited such as they are, without any insertions. They are given by _S_\naunaka, Ait. \xc3\x82r. V, 2, 1.\n\n[187:3](sbe01196.htm#fr_464) It was created from the mouth of Pra _g_ apati.\n\n[187:4](sbe01196.htm#fr_465) They are called so, because the word arka occurs\nin them.\n\n[187:5](sbe01196.htm#fr_466) The chanters of the Sama-veda make a Triv _ri_ t\nStoma of this hymn, without any repetitions, leaving out the tenth verse. The\nreciters of the Rig-veda excel them therefore by reciting a tenth verse. This\nis called ati _s_ a _m_ sanam (or -na).\n\n[188:1](sbe01196.htm#fr_467) Vi _g_ avas may be a singular, and the\ncommentator seems to take it as such in his first explanation. The text, ta\nvira _g_ o bhavanti, proves nothing, because it could not be sa vira _g_ o\nbhavanti, nor even sa vira _d_ bhavati. Possibly the word may occur in both\nforms, vi _g_ u, plural vi _g_ ava _h_ , and vi _g_ ava _h_. In a somewhat\nsimilar way we find griva and griva _h_ , folia and la feuille. On p. 109, the\ncommentator speaks of vi _g_ avabhaga, and again, p. 110, pakshamularupa vi\n_g_ ava abhihita _h_. He, however, explains its meaning rightly, as the root\nof the wings, or rather the lower bones of the neck. Griva _h_ , plural, were\noriginally the vertebrae of the neck. The paragraph, though very empty,\ncontains at least some interesting forms of language. First vi _g_ u,\nvertebrae, then the participles duta and samba _lh_ atama, and lastly the verb\npratya _k_ , the last probably used in the sense of to bring near, to\nrepresent, with the superlative adverb annatamam (Pa _n_. V, 4, 11), i. e.\nthey are represented as if they brought the best food.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4, 2](sbe01197.htm)\n\n"
