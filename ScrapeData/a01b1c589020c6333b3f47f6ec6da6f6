"I am afraid we have\nspoilt your appetite," he said.\n\nI felt greatly ashamed. Indeed, I had been too indecently quick over my\ndinner. With a little calculation, it would become quite evident that my non-\neating had surpassed the eating. But I had no idea that anyone could have been\ndeliberately calculating.\n\nI suppose Sandip Babu detected my feeling of shame, which only augmented it.\n"I was sure," he said, "that you had the impulse of the wild deer to run away,\nbut it is a great boon that you took the trouble to keep your promise with\nme."\n\nI could not think of any suitable reply and so I sat down, blushing and\nuncomfortable, at one end of the sofa. The vision that I had of myself, as the\n_Shakti_ of Womanhood, incarnate, crowning Sandip Babu simply with my\npresence, majestic and unashamed, failed me altogether.\n\nSandip Babu deliberately started a discussion with my husband. He knew that\nhis keen wit flashed to the best effect in an argument. I have often since\nobserved, that he never lost an opportunity for a passage at arms whenever I\nhappened to be present.\n\nHe was familiar with my husband\'s views on the cult of _Bande Mataram_ , and\nbegan in a provoking way: "So you do not allow that there is room for an\nappeal to the imagination in patriotic work?"\n\n"It has its place, Sandip, I admit, but I do not believe in giving it the\nwhole place. I would know my country in its frank reality, and for this I am\nboth afraid and ashamed to make use of hypnotic texts of patriotism."\n\n"What you call hypnotic texts I call truth. I truly believe my country to be\nmy God. I worship Humanity. God manifests Himself both in man and in his\ncountry."\n\n"If that is what you really believe, there should be no difference for you\nbetween man and man, and so between country and country."\n\n"Quite true. But my powers are limited, so my worship of Humanity is continued\nin the worship of my country."\n\n"I have nothing against your worship as such, but how is it you propose to\nconduct your worship of God by hating other countries in which He is equally\nmanifest?"\n\n"Hate is also an adjunct of worship. Arjuna won Mahadeva\'s favour by wrestling\nwith him. God will be with us in the end, if we are prepared to give Him\nbattle."\n\n"If that be so, then those who are serving and those who are harming the\ncountry are both His devotees. Why, then, trouble to preach patriotism?"\n\n"In the case of one\'s own country, it is different. There the heart clearly\ndemands worship."\n\n"If you push the same argument further you can say that since God is\nmanifested in us, our _self_ has to be worshipped before all else; because our\nnatural instinct claims it."\n\n"Look here, Nikhil, this is all merely dry logic. Can\'t you recognize that\nthere is such a thing as feeling?"\n\n"I tell you the truth, Sandip," my husband replied. "It is my feelings that\nare outraged, whenever you try to pass off injustice as a duty, and\nunrighteousness as a moral ideal. The fact, that I am incapable of stealing,\nis not due to my possessing logical faculties, but to my having some feeling\nof respect for myself and love for ideals."\n\nI was raging inwardly. At last I could keep silent no longer. "Is not the\nhistory of every country," I cried, "whether England, France, Germany, or\nRussia, the history of stealing for the sake of one\'s own country?"\n\n"They have to answer for these thefts; they are doing so even now; their\nhistory is not yet ended."\n\n"At any rate," interposed Sandip Babu, "why should we not follow suit? Let us\nfirst fill our country\'s coffers with stolen goods and then take centuries,\nlike these other countries, to answer for them, if we must. But, I ask you,\nwhere do you find this \'answering\' in history?"\n\n"When Rome was answering for her sin no one knew it. All that time, there was\napparently no limit to her prosperity. But do you not see one thing: how these\npolitical bags of theirs are bursting with lies and treacheries, breaking\ntheir backs under their weight?"\n\nNever before had I had any opportunity of being present at a discussion\nbetween my husband and his men friends. Whenever he argued with me I could\nfeel his reluctance to push me into a corner. This arose out of the very love\nhe bore me. Today for the first time I saw his fencer\'s skill in debate.\n\nNevertheless, my heart refused to accept my husband\'s position. I was\nstruggling to find some answer, but it would not come. When the word\n"righteousness" comes into an argument, it sounds ugly to say that a thing can\nbe too good to be useful.\n\nAll of a sudden Sandip Babu turned to me with the question: "What do _you_ say\nto this?"\n\n"I do not care about fine distinctions," I broke out. "I will tell you broadly\nwhat I feel. I am only human. I am covetous. I would have good things for my\ncountry. If I am obliged, I would snatch them and filch them. I have anger. I\nwould be angry for my country\'s sake. If necessary, I would smite and slay to\navenge her insults. I have my desire to be fascinated, and fascination must be\nsupplied to me in bodily shape by my country. She must have some visible\nsymbol casting its spell upon my mind. I would make my country a Person, and\ncall her Mother, Goddess, Durga--for whom I would redden the earth with\nsacrificial offerings. I am human, not divine."\n\nSandip Babu leapt to his feet with uplifted arms and shouted "Hurrah!"--The\nnext moment he corrected himself and cried: " _Bande Mataram_."\n\nA shadow of pain passed over the face of my husband. He said to me in a very\ngentle voice: "Neither am I divine: I am human. And therefore I dare not\npermit the evil which is in me to be exaggerated into an image of my country--\nnever, never!"\n\nSandip Babu cried out: "See, Nikhil, how in the heart of a woman Truth takes\nflesh and blood. Woman knows how to be cruel: her virulence is like a blind\nstorm. It is beautifully fearful. In man it is ugly, because it harbours in\nits centre the gnawing worms of reason and thought. I tell you, Nikhil, it is\nour women who will save the country. This is not the time for nice scruples.\nWe must be unswervingly, unreasoningly brutal. We must sin. We must give our\nwomen red sandal paste with which to anoint and enthrone our sin. Don\'t you\nremember what the poet says:\n\nCome, Sin, O beautiful Sin,  \nLet thy stinging red kisses pour down fiery red wine into our blood.  \nSound the trumpet of imperious evil  \nAnd cross our forehead with the wreath of exulting lawlessness,  \nO Deity of Desecration,  \nSmear our breasts with the blackest mud of disrepute, unashamed.\n\nDown with that righteousness, which cannot smilingly bring rack and ruin."\n\nWhen Sandip Babu, standing with his head high, insulted at a moment\'s impulse\nall that men have cherished as their highest, in all countries and in all\ntimes, a shiver went right through my body.\n\nBut, with a stamp of his foot, he continued his declamation: "I can see that\nyou are that beautiful spirit of fire, which burns the home to ashes and\nlights up the larger world with its flame. Give to us the indomitable courage\nto go to the bottom of Ruin itself. Impart grace to all that is baneful."\n\nIt was not clear to whom Sandip Babu addressed his last appeal. It might have\nbeen She whom he worshipped with his _Bande Mataram_. It might have been the\nWomanhood of his country. Or it might have been its representative, the woman\nbefore him. He would have gone further in the same strain, but my husband\nsuddenly rose from his seat and touched him lightly on the shoulder saying:\n"Sandip, Chandranath Babu is here."\n\nI started and turned round, to find an aged gentleman at the door, calm and\ndignified, in doubt as to whether he should come in or retire. His face was\ntouched with a gentle light like that of the setting sun.\n\nMy husband came up to me and whispered: "This is my master, of whom I have so\noften told you. Make your obeisance to him."\n\nI bent reverently and took the dust of his feet. He gave me his blessing\nsaying: "May God protect you always, my little mother." I was sorely in need\nof such a blessing at that moment.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I](hw06.htm)\n\n'
