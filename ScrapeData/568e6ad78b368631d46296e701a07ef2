But ( _k_ ara _n_ a means) nothing but good and evil works; thus Badari\nopines.\n\nThe teacher Badari, however, thinks that the word ' _k_ ara _n_ a' denotes\nnothing else but good works and evil works. It means the same as anush _th_\nana (performance) or karman (work). For we see that the root _k_ ar (to walk,\nto conduct oneself) is used in the general sense of acting. Of a man who\nperforms holy works such as sacrifices, &c., people say in ordinary language,\n'that excellent man walks in righteousness.' The word a _k_ ara also denotes\nonly a kind of religious duty. That works and _k_ ara _n_ a (conduct) are\nsometimes spoken of as different things is analogous to the distinction\nsometimes made between Brahma _n_ as and Parivra _g_ akas 2. We, therefore,\ndecide that by men of good _k_ ara _n_ a are meant those whose works are\nworthy of praise, by men of evil _k_ ara _n_ a those whose works are worthy of\nblame.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[121:2](sbe38087.htm#fr_96) Although the latter are a mere sub-class of the\nformer.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 1, 12](sbe38088.htm)\n\n"
