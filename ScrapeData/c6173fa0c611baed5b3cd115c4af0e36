After a long time, however, a son was\npromised to her.\n\nQueen Lona returned to the palace, and when the time for the birth of the\npromised son drew nigh, she inquired of three Jogis who came begging to her\ngate, what the child\'s fate would be, and the youngest of them answered and\nsaid, "Oh, Queen! the child will be a boy, and he will live to be a great man.\nBut for twelve years you must not look upon his face, for if either you or his\nfather see it before the twelve years are past, you will surely die! This is\nwhat you must do; as soon as the child is born you must send him away to a\ncellar underneath the ground, and never let him see the light of day for\ntwelve years. After they are over, he may come forth, bathe in the river, put\non new clothes, and visit you. His name shall be Raja Rasalu, and he shall be\nknown far and wide."\n\nSo, when a fair young Prince was in due time born into the world, his parents\nhid him away in an underground palace, with nurses, and servants, and\neverything else a King\'s son might desire. And with him they sent a young\ncolt, born the same day, and sword, spear, and shield, against the day when\nRaja Rasalu should go forth into the world.\n\nSo there the child lived, playing with his colt, and talking to his parrot,\nwhile the nurses taught him all things needful for a King\'s son to know.\n\nYoung Rasalu lived on, far from the light of day, for eleven long years,\ngrowing tall and strong, yet contented to remain playing with his colt, and\ntalking to his parrot; but when the twelfth year began, the lad\'s heart leapt\nup with desire for change, and he loved to listen to the sounds of life which\ncame to him in his palace-prison from the outside world.\n\n"I must go and see where the voices come from!" he said; and when his nurses\ntold him he must not go for one year more, he only laughed aloud, saying,\n"Nay! I stay no longer here for any man!"\n\nThen he saddled his Arab horse Bhaunr, put on his shining armour, and rode\nforth into the world; but, mindful of what his nurses had oft told him, when\nhe came to the river, he dismounted, and, going into the water, washed himself\nand his clothes.\n\nThen, clean of raiment, fair of face, and brave of heart, he rode on his way\nuntil he reached his father\'s city. There he sat down to rest awhile by a\nwell, where the women were drawing water in earthen pitchers. Now, as they\npassed him, their full pitchers poised upon their heads, the gay young prince\nflung stones at the earthen vessels, and broke them all. Then the women,\ndrenched with water, went weeping and wailing to the palace, complaining to\nthe King that a mighty young Prince in shining armour, with a parrot on his\nwrist and a gallant steed beside him, sat by the well, and broke their\npitchers.\n\nNow, as soon as Raja Salabhan heard this, he guessed at once that it was\nPrince Rasalu come forth before the time, and, mindful of the Jogis\' words\nthat he would die if he looked on his son\'s face before twelve years were\npast, he did not dare to send his guards to seize the offender and bring him\nto be judged. So he bade the women be comforted, and take pitchers of iron and\nbrass, giving new ones from the treasury to those who did not possess any of\ntheir own.\n\nBut when Prince Rasalu saw the women returning to the well with pitchers of\niron and brass, he laughed to himself, and drew his mighty bow till the sharp-\npointed arrows pierced the metal vessels as though they had been clay.\n\nYet still the King did not send for him, so he mounted his steed and set off\nin the pride of his youth and strength to the palace. He strode into the\naudience hall, where his father sat trembling, and saluted him with all\nreverence; but Raja Salabhan, in fear of his life, turned his back hastily and\nsaid never a word in reply.\n\nThen Prince Rasalu called scornfully to him across the hall:\n\n"I came to greet thee, King, and not to harm thee!  \nWhat have I done that thou shouldst turn away?  \nSceptre and empire have no power to charm me--  \nI go to seek a worthier prize than they!"\n\nThen he strode away, full of bitterness and anger; but as he passed under the\npalace windows, he heard his mother weeping, and the sound softened his heart,\nso that his wrath died down, and a great loneliness fell upon him, because he\nwas spurned by both father and mother. So he cried sorrowfully,\n\n"Oh heart crown\'d with grief, hast thou nought  \nBut tears for thy son?  \nArt mother of mine? Give one thought  \nTo my life just begun!"\n\nAnd Queen Lona answered through her tears:\n\n"Yea! mother am I, though I weep,  \nSo hold this word sure,--  \nGo, reign king of all men, but keep  \nThy heart good and pure!"\n\nSo Raja Rasalu was comforted, and began to make ready for fortune. He took\nwith him his horse Bhaunr and his parrot, both of whom had lived with him\nsince he was born. So they made a goodly company, and Queen Lona, when she saw\nthem going, watched them from her window till she saw nothing but a cloud of\ndust on the horizon; then she bowed her head on her hands and wept, saying:\n\n"Oh! son who ne\'er gladdened mine eyes,  \nLet the cloud of thy going arise,  \nDim the sunlight and darken the day;  \nFor the mother whose son is away  \nIs as dust!"\n\nRasalu had started off to play chaupur with King Sarkap. And as he journeyed\nthere came a fierce storm of thunder and lightning, so that he sought shelter,\nand found none save an old graveyard, where a headless corpse lay upon the\nground; So lonesome was it that even the corpse seemed company, and Rasalu,\nsitting down beside it, said:\n\n"There is no one here, nor far nor near,  \nSave this breathless corpse so cold and grim;  \nWould God he might come to life again,  \n\'Twould be less lonely to talk to him."\n\nAnd immediately the headless corpse arose and sat beside Raja Rasalu. And he,\nnothing astonished, said to it:\n\n"The storm beats fierce and loud,  \nThe clouds rise thick in the west;  \nWhat ails thy grave and shroud,  \nOh corpse! that thou canst not rest?"\n\nThen the headless corpse replied:\n\n"On earth I was even as thou,  \nMy turban awry like a king,  \nMy head with the highest, I trow,  \nHaving my fun and my fling,  \nFighting my foes like a brave,  \nLiving my life with a swing.  \nAnd, now I am dead,  \nSins, heavy as lead,  \nWill give me no rest in my grave!"\n\nSo the night passed on, dark and dreary, while Rasalu sat in the graveyard and\ntalked to the headless corpse. Now when morning broke and Rasalu said he must\ncontinue his journey, the headless corpse asked him whither he was going, and\nwhen he said "to play chaupur with King Sarkap," the corpse begged him to give\nup the idea saying, "I am King Sarkap\'s brother, and I know his ways. Every\nday, before breakfast, he cuts off the heads of two or three men, just to\namuse himself. One day no one else was at hand, so he cut off mine, and he\nwill surely cut off yours on some pretence or another. However, if you are\ndetermined to go and play chaupur with him, take some of the bones from this\ngraveyard, and make your dice out of them, and then the enchanted dice with\nwhich my brother plays will lose their virtue. Otherwise he will always win."\n\nSo Rasalu took some of the bones lying about, and fashioned them into dice,\nand these he put into his pocket. Then, bidding adieu to the headless corpse,\nhe went on his way to play chaupur with the King.\n\nNow, as Raja Rasalu, tender-hearted and strong, journeyed along to play\nchaupur with the King, he came to a burning forest, and a voice rose from the\nfire saying, "Oh, traveller! for God\'s sake save me from the fire!"\n\nThen the Prince turned towards the burning forest, and, lo! the voice was the\nvoice of a tiny cricket. Nevertheless, Rasalu, tender-hearted and strong,\nsnatched it from the fire and set it at liberty. Then the little creature,\nfull of, gratitude, pulled out one of its feelers, and giving it to its\npreserver, said, "Keep this, and should you ever be in trouble, put it into\nthe fire, and instantly I will come to your aid."\n\nThe Prince smiled, saying, "What help could _you_ give _me?"_ Nevertheless, he\nkept the hair and went on his way.\n\nNow, when he reached the city of King Sarkap, seventy maidens, daughters of\nthe King, came out to meet him--seventy fair maidens, merry and careless, full\nof smiles and laughter; but one, the youngest of them all, when she saw the\ngallant young Prince riding on Bhaunr Iraqi, going gaily to his doom, was\nfilled with pity, and called to him saying:\n\n"Fair Prince, on the charger so gray,  \nTurn thee back! turn thee back!  \nOr lower thy lance for the fray;  \nThy head will be forfeit to-day!  \nDost love life? then, stranger, I pray,  \nTurn thee back! turn thee back!"\n\nBut he, smiling at the maiden, answered lightly:\n\n"Fair maiden, I come from afar,  \nSworn conqueror in love and in war!  \nKing Sarkap my coming will rue,  \nHis head in four pieces I\'ll hew;  \nThen forth as a bridegroom I\'ll ride,  \nWith you, little maid, as my bride!"\n\nNow when Rasalu replied so gallantly, the maiden looked in his face, and\nseeing how fair he was, and how brave and strong, she straightway fell in love\nwith him, and would gladly have followed him through the world.\n\nBut the other sixty-nine maidens, being jealous, laughed scornfully at her,\nsaying, "Not so fast, oh gallant warrior! If you would marry our sister you\nmust first do our bidding, for you will be our younger brother."\n\n"Fair sisters!" quoth Rasalu gaily, "give me my task and I will perform it."\n\nSo the sixty-nine maidens mixed a hundredweight of millet seed with a\nhundredweight of sand, and giving it to Rasalu, bade him separate the seed\nfrom the sand.\n\nThen he bethought him of the cricket, and drawing, the feeler from his pocket,\nthrust it into the fire. And immediately there was a whirring noise in the\nair, and a great flight of crickets alighted beside him, and amongst them the\ncricket whose life he had saved.\n\nThen Rasalu said, "Separate the millet seed from the sand."\n\n"Is that all?" quoth the cricket; "had I known how small a job you wanted me\nto do, I would not have assembled so many of my brethren."\n\nWith that the flight of crickets set to work, and in one night they separated\nthe seed from the sand.\n\nNow when the sixty-nine fair maidens, daughters of the king, saw that Rasalu\nhad performed his task, they set him another, bidding him swing them all, one\nby one, in their swings, until they were tired.\n\nWhereupon he laughed, saying, "There are seventy of you, counting my little\nbride yonder, and I am not going to spend my life swinging girls! Why, by the\ntime I have given each of you a swing, the first will be wanting another! No!\nif you want a swing, get in, all seventy of you, into one swing, and then I\'ll\nsee what can be done."\n\nSo the seventy maidens climbed into one swing, and Raja Rasalu, standing in\nhis shining armour, fastened the ropes to his mighty bow, and drew it up to\nits fullest bent. Then he let go, and like an arrow the swing shot into the\nair, with its burden of seventy fair maidens, merry and careless, full of\nsmiles and laughter.\n\nBut as it swung back again, Rasalu, standing there in his shining armour, drew\nhis sharp sword and severed, the ropes. Then the seventy fair maidens fell to\nthe ground headlong; and some were bruised and some broken, but the only one\nwho escaped unhurt was the maiden who loved Rasalu, for she fell out last, on\nthe top of the others, and so came to no harm.\n\nAfter this, Rasalu strode on fifteen paces, till he came to the seventy drums,\nthat every one who came to play chaupur with the King had to beat in turn; and\nhe beat them so loudly that he broke them all. Then he came to the seventy\ngongs, all in a row, and he hammered them so hard that they cracked to pieces.\n\nSeeing this, the youngest Princess, who was the only one who could run, fled\nto her father the King in a great fright, saying:\n\n"A mighty Prince, Sarkap! making havoc, rides along,  \n\'He swung us, seventy maidens fair, and threw us out headlong;  \nHe broke the drums you placed there and the gongs too in his pride,  \nSure, he will kill thee, father mine, and take me for his bride!"\n\nBut King Sarkap replied scornfully:\n\n"Silly maiden, thy words make a lot  \nOf a very small matter;  \nFor fear of my valour, I wot,  \nHis armour will clatter.  \nAs soon as I\'ve eaten my bread  \nI\'ll go forth and cut off his head!"\n\nNotwithstanding these brave and boastful words, he was in reality very much\nafraid, having heard of Rasalu\'s renown. And learning that he was stopping at\nthe house of an old woman in the city, till the hour for playing chaupur\narrived, Sarkap sent slaves to him with trays of sweetmeats and fruit, as to\nan honoured guest. But the food was poisoned. Now when the slaves brought the\ntrays to Raja Rasalu, he rose up haughtily, saying, "Go, tell your master I\nhave nought to do with him in friendship. I am his sworn enemy, and I eat not\nof his salt!"\n\nSo saying, he threw the sweetmeats to Raja Sarkap\'s dog, which had followed\nthe slave, and lo! the dog died.\n\nThen Rasalu was very wroth, and said bitterly, "Go back to Sarkap, slaves! and\ntell him that Rasalu deems it no act of bravery to kill even an enemy by\ntreachery."\n\nNow, when evening came, Raja Rasalu went forth to play chaupur with King\nSarkap, and as he passed some potters\' kilns he saw a cat wandering about\nrestlessly; so he asked what ailed her, that she never stood still, and she\nreplied, "My kittens are in an unbaked pot in the kiln yonder. It has just\nbeen set alight, .and my children will be baked alive; therefore I cannot\nrest!"\n\nHer words moved the heart of Raja Rasalu, and, going to the potter, he asked\nhim to sell the kiln as it was; but the potter replied that he could not\nsettle a fair price till the pots were burnt, as he could not tell how many\nwould come out whole. Nevertheless, after some bargaining, he consented at\nlast to sell the kiln, and Rasalu, having searched all the pots, restored the\nkittens to their mother, and she, in gratitude for his mercy, gave him one of\nthem, saying, "Put it in your pocket, for it will help you when you are in\ndifficulties." So Raja Rasalu put the kitten in his pocket, and went to play\nchaupur with the King.\n\nNow, before they sat down to play, Raja Sarkap fixed his stakes,--on the first\ngame, his kingdom; on the second, the wealth of the whole world; and, on the\nthird, his own head. So, likewise, Raja Rasalu fixed his stakes,--on the first\ngame, his arms; on the second, his horse; and, on the third, his own head.\n\nThen they began to play, and it fell to Rasalu\'s lot to make the first move.\nNow he, forgetful of the dead man\'s warning, played with the dice given him by\nRaja Sarkap, besides which, Sarkap let loose his famous rat, Dhol Raja, and it\nran about the board, upsetting the chaupur pieces on the sly, so that Rasalu\nlost the first game, and gave up his shining armour.\n\nThen the second game began, and once more Dhol Raja, the rat, upset the\npieces; and Rasalu, losing the game, gave up his faithful steed. Then Bhaunr,\nthe Arab steed, who stood by, found voice, and cried to his master,\n\n"Sea-born am I, bought with much gold;  \nDear Prince! trust me now as of old.  \nI\'ll carry you far from these wiles--  \nMy flight, all unspurr\'d, will be swift as a bird,  \nFor thousands and thousands of miles!  \nOr if needs you must stay; ere the next game you play,  \nPlace hand in your pocket, I pray!"\n\nHearing this, Raja Sarkap frowned, and bade his slaves,remove Bhaunr, the Arab\nsteed, since he gave his master advice in the game. Now, when the slaves came\nto lead the faithful steed away, Rasalu could not refrain from tears, thinking\nover the long years during which Bhaunr, the Arab steed, had been his\ncompanion. But the horse cried out again,\n\n"Weep not, dear Prince! I shall not eat my bread  \nOf stranger hands, nor to strange stall be led.  \nTake thy right hand, and place it as I said."\n\nThese words roused some recollection in Rasalu\'s mind, and when, just at this\nmoment, the kitten in his pocket began to struggle, he remembered all about\nthe warning, and the dice made from dead men\'s bones. Then his heart rose up\nonce more, and he called boldly to Raja Sarkap, "Leave my horse and arms here\nfor the present. Time enough to take them away when you have won my head!"\n\nNow, Raja Sarkap, seeing Rasalu\'s confident bearing, began to be afraid, and\nordered all the women of his palace to come forth in their gayest attire and\nstand before Rasalu, so as to distract his attention from the game. But he\nnever even looked at them, and throwing the dice from his pocket, said to\nSarkap, "We have played with your dice all this time; now we will play with\nmine."\n\nThen the kitten went and sat at the window through which the rat Dhol Raja\nused to come, and the game began.\n\nAfter a while, Sarkap, seeing Raja Rasalu was winning, called to his rat, but\nwhen Dhol Raja saw the kitten he was afraid, and would not go further. So\nRasalu won, and took back his arms. \'Next he played for his horse, and once\nmore Raja Sarkap called for his rat; but Dhol Raja, seeing the kitten keeping\nwatch, was afraid. So Rasalu won the second stake, and took back Bhaunr, the\nArab steed.\n\nThen Sarkap brought all his skill to bear on the third and last game, saying,\n\n"Oh moulded pieces! favour me to-day!  \nFor sooth this is a man with whom I play.  \nNo paltry risk--but life and death at stake;  \nAs Sarkap does, so do, for Sarkap\'s sake!"\n\nBut Rasalu answered back,\n\n"Oh moulded pieces! favour me to.day!  \nFor sooth it is a man with whom I play.  \nNo paltry risk--but life and death at stake;  \nAs Heaven does, so do, for Heaven\'s sake!"\n\nSo they began to play, whilst the women stood round in a circle, and the\nkitten watched Dhol Raja from the window. Then Sarkap lost, first his kingdom,\nthen the wealth of the whole world, and lastly his head.\n\nJust then, a servant came in to announce the birth of a daughter to Raja\nSarkap, and he, overcome by misfortunes, said, "Kill her at once! for she has\nbeen born in an evil moment, and has brought her father ill luck!"\n\nBut Rasalu rose up in his shining armour, tender-hearted and strong, saying,\n"Not so, oh king! She has done no evil. Give me this child to wife; and if you\nwill vow, by all you hold sacred, never again to play chaupur for another\'s\nhead, I will spare yours now!"\n\nThen Sarkap vowed a solemn vow never to play for another\'s head; and after\nthat he took a fresh mango branch, and the new-born babe, and placing them on\na golden dish gave them to Rasalu.\n\nNow, as be left the palace, carrying with him the new-born babe and the mango\nbranch, he met a band of prisoners, and they called out to him,\n\n"A royal hawk art thou, oh King, the rest  \nBut timid wild-fowl. Grant us. our request,--  \nUnloose these chains, and live for ever blest!"\n\nAnd Raja Rasalu hearkened to them, and bade King Sarkap set them at liberty.\n\nThen he went to the Murti Hills, and placed the new-born babe, Kokilan, in an\nunderground palace, and planted the mango branch at the door, saying, " In\ntwelve years the mango tree will blossom; then will I return and marry\nKokilan."\n\nAnd after twelve years, the mango tree began to flower, and Raja Rasalu\nmarried the Princess Kokilan, whom he won from Sarkap when he played chaupur\nwith the King.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Ass in the Lion\'s Skin](ift21.htm)\n\n'
