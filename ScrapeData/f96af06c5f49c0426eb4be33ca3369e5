Built is the Garhapatya, unbuilt the \xc3\x82havaniya; he then buys the\nking (Soma): the Garhapatya being this (terrestrial) world, the \xc3\x82havaniya the\nsky, and Soma he that blows yonder, he thus places him (Vayu, the wind)\nbetween these two worlds; and hence he blows between these two worlds.\n\n7:3:1:22\\. And as to why he buys the king when the Garhapatya is built, and\nthe \xc3\x82havaniya unbuilt,--Agni is the body, and Soma the vital air: he thus\nplaces the vital air in the middle of the body, and hence that vital air is in\nthe middle of the body.\n\n7:3:1:33\\. And, again, why he buys the king when the Garhapatya is built, and\nthe \xc3\x82havaniya unbuilt,--Agni is the body, and Soma is the life-sap: he thus\nsupplies the body with life-sap, and hence this body (of ours) is supplied\nwith life-sap from end to end.\n\n7:3:1:44\\. Having bought the king, and driven him about, he then takes out the\nmaterial for the guest-meal. With the Havishk _ri_ t of that (ceremony) he\nreleases speech. And in this way 1 he interlinks the performance\n\np. 343\n\nof the (Soma) sacrifice and the performance of the fire (altar) for the\npurpose of unity of performance, thinking, 'Uniform shall be this\nperformance!'\n\n7:3:1:55\\. And, again, why he interlinks them,--Agni (the fire-altar) is the\nbody, and the (Soma) sacrifice is the vital air: he thus places the vital air\nin the midst of the body, and hence that vital air is in the middle of the\nbody.\n\n7:3:1:66\\. And, again, why he interlinks them,--Agni is the body, and the\n(Soma) sacrifice is the vital sap: he thus supplies the body with vital sap,\nand hence this body is supplied with vital sap from end to end. He then\nreturns to the site of the \xc3\x82havaniya.\n\n7:3:1:77\\. Now some sweep with the pala _s_ a branch on both occasions 1,\nsaying, 'Surely, on both occasions he builds (an altar).' Let him, however,\nnot do so; for by (building) the Garhapatya he settles, and by the \xc3\x82havaniya\nhe rises upwards: therefore let him not do so.\n\n7:3:1:88\\. And only on the Garhapatya (site) he throws saline soil, not on the\n\xc3\x82havaniya; for the Garhapatya is this (terrestrial) world, and saline soil\nmeans cattle: he thus bestows cattle on this world, whence there are cattle in\nthis world.\n\n7:3:1:99\\. And only on the \xc3\x82havaniya (site) he places a lotus leaf, not on the\nGarhapatya; for the lotus leaf means water, and the \xc3\x82havaniya the sky: he thus\nplaces the waters (vapours) in the sky. On both he\n\np. 344\n\nscatters sand; for sand means seed, and in both (fire-altars) fashioning (of\nAgni) takes place: 'May he be fashioned from out of that seed!' thus he\nthinks.\n\n7:3:1:1010\\. He scatters it with two different formulas; for the Garhapatya is\nthe world of men, and the \xc3\x82havaniya is the world of the gods, and different\nindeed are the divine and the human. With the longer formula he scatters it on\nthe \xc3\x82havaniya, and with the shorter one on the Garhapatya, for longer is the\nlife of the gods, and shorter the life of men. On the Garhapatya he scatters\nthe sand before (the setting up of) the enclosing-stones; for sand is seed:\n'May these be fashioned from out of that seed!' thus he thinks.\n\n7:3:1:1111\\. As to this they say, 'If the enclosing-stones are the womb, and\nthe sand is seed, and the sand is strown on the Garhapatya before (the setting\nup of) the enclosing-stones, how, then, is that seed of his not shed aside,\n(but) is received (by the womb)?' Well, the saline soil is the amnion, and\ninasmuch as he strews first the saline soil, that seed of his is not shed\naside, but is received by that amnion. He now addresses the enclosing-stones\non the \xc3\x82havaniya: the meaning of this has been explained 1. He then scatters\nsand: sand being seed, that seed of his is not shed aside, but is received\nalso by that womb.\n\n7:3:1:1212\\. And only on the \xc3\x82havaniya he strokes it (even) with two (verses)\ncontaining (the verb) 'to grow 2,' not on the Garhapatya; for the Garhapatya\nis this (terrestrial) world, and the \xc3\x82havaniya is the heavenly world; and this\nSacrificer, being indeed\n\np. 345\n\nborn in this world, is really intended to be born in the heavenly world: when\nhe strokes (the sand) even on the \xc3\x82havaniya with two (verses) containing (the\nverb) 'to grow,' and not on the Garhapatya, he causes him to be born in the\nheavenly world.\n\n7:3:1:1313\\. He now puts clod-bricks thereon 1,--that fire-altar is these\nworlds, and the clod-bricks are the regions: he thus places the regions into\nthese worlds; whence there are those regions in these worlds.\n\n7:3:1:1414\\. He takes them from outside the (site of the) fire-altar; for\nthose regions which are in these worlds are already possessed by him (Agni);\nand he now bestows on him those regions which are beyond these worlds.\n\n7:3:1:1515\\. From outside the Vedi (he takes them);--the Vedi being this\n(earth), and those regions which are on this (earth) being already possessed\nby him, he now bestows on him those regions which are beyond this (earth).\n\n7:3:1:1616\\. And, again, why he puts clod-bricks thereon,--when Pra _g_ apati\nwas disjointed, his vital sap flowed over all the regions (or, in all\ndirections); and when the gods restored him 2 they, by means of these clod-\nbricks, put into him that vital sap; and in like manner does this one now put\nthat vital sap into him.\n\n7:3:1:1717\\. He takes them from outside (the site of) the fire-altar; for the\nvital sap which is in these worlds is already possessed by him (Agni), and he\nnow puts\n\np. 346\n\ninto him that vital sap which flowed away beyond these worlds 1.\n\n7:3:1:1818\\. From outside the Vedi (he takes them),--the Vedi being this\n(earth), and that vital sap which is in this (terrestrial) world being already\npossessed by him, he now puts into him the vital sap which flowed beyond this\n(earth).\n\n7:3:1:1919\\. He takes them with the sacrificial (wooden) sword,--the sword is\na thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt means force, and this (earth) means wealth:\nby force he thus obtains wealth.\n\n7:3:1:2020\\. From the front side he brings one, with (Va _g_. S. XII, 102),\n'May he not injure me who is the begetter of the Earth!'--the begetter of the\nEarth doubtless is Pra _g_ apati (the lord of creatures and generation): thus,\n'May Pra _g_ apati not injure me!'--'Or he of true ordinances who hath\npervaded the sky,' that is, 'Or he of true ordinances who has created the\nsky;'--'Or he who first begat the shining waters,'--the shining waters\ndoubtless are the men: thus, 'he who first created men;'--'To the god Ka\n(who?) let us do homage by offering!' Ka doubtless is Pra _g_ apati, thus, 'To\nhim let us do homage by offering!' Having brought it he puts it on the body\n(of the altar-site) inside the enclosing-stones: he thereby puts into him\n(Agni) what vital sap had flowed away from him in the eastern direction, and\nalso the eastern region itself he bestows upon him.\n\n7:3:1:2121\\. Then (he fetches a clod) from the south, with (Va _g_. S. XII,\n103), 'Turn hither, O Earth, with\n\np. 347\n\nsacrifice, with milk!' as the text, so the meaning;--'Agni, sent forth, hath\nmounted thy skin;' whatsoever is on this (earth) that is her skin; and that\n(skin) Agni mounts, when sent forth, when blazing forth. Having brought it he\nputs it on the body (of the altar) inside the junction of the (right) wing\n(and the body): he thereby puts into him (Agni) what vital sap had flowed from\nhim in the southern direction, and also the southern region itself he bestows\nupon him.\n\n7:3:1:2222\\. Then from behind (he fetches one, with Va _g_. S. XII, 104), 'O\nAgni, what in thee is pure, what brilliant, what clean, what meet for\nsacrifice,'--Agni doubtless is this (earth): of her he says this;--'that do we\nbring to the gods,' that is, 'that we bring for this divine work.' Having\nbrought it he puts it on the body (of the altar) inside the junction of the\ntail (and the body): he thereby puts into him what vital sap had flowed away\nfrom him in the western direction, and also the western region itself he\nbestows upon him. Let him not take it exactly from the back (west) lest he\nshould take the vital sap from the path of the sacrifice: he takes it from\nabout there 1.\n\n7:3:1:2323\\. Then from the north, with (Va _g_. S. XII, 105), 'Sap and\nstrength have I taken from here 2,'--that is, 'Sap and strength I take from\nhere;'--'the womb of sacred law,' the sacred law doubtless is the truth: thus,\n'the womb of the truth;'--'the stream of the mighty,' the mighty (buffalo, or\n\np. 348\n\nmahisha) doubtless is Agni, for he, being born here great (mahat), animated\neverything;--'May it accrue to me in the cows, in the bodies,'--the body is\nthe self: thus, 'May it accrue to me both in the cows and in (my own)\nself;'--'I leave behind decline, weakness, sickness!' therewith he spreads the\nsand (by stroking): he thereby consigns to that (northern) region whatever\ndecline, weakness, and sickness there is; whence hungry people (live) in that\nregion. Having brought that (clod), he puts it on the body (of the altar) on\nthe middle of the junction of the (left) wing (and the body): he thereby puts\ninto him (Agni) what vital sap flowed away in the northerly direction; and\nalso the northern region itself he bestows upon him.\n\n7:3:1:2424\\. These same (clods) are the regions; he places them on all sides:\nhe thus places the regions on all sides; whence the regions are on every side.\n[He places the clods so] as to face each other from every side: he thereby\nplaces the regions to face each other from every side, and hence the regions\nface each other from every side. He places them separately, 'settles 1' them\nseparately, and separately pronounces the Sudadohas upon them; for separate\nfrom each other are the regions. Standing he places them, for the regions, as\nit were, stand; and stronger, indeed, one is whilst standing.\n\n7:3:1:2525\\. These same (clods) are bricks having special prayers (ya _g_\nushmati 2): on the body (of the altar) he places them, not on the wings and\ntail; for bricks having special prayers are placed on the body, not on the\nwings or tail.\n\np. 349\n\n7:3:1:2626\\. As to this they say, 'How do these (clod-bricks) come to be put\non as baked, as heated (burnt) ones?' Well, these (clods) are vital sap, and\nthe vital sap (blood) is naturally-heated; and, moreover, whatever comes in\ncontact with Agni Vai _s_ vanara, even thereby comes to be put on as baked, as\nheated.\n\n7:3:1:2727\\. He then throws up the Uttara-vedi 1 (high-altar),--the Vedi is\nthis (earth), the Uttara-vedi the sky, and the clod-bricks are the regions:\nthus when he puts on the clod-bricks between (the preparation of) the Vedi and\n(that of) the Uttara-vedi, he thereby places the regions between these two\nworlds; whence the regions are between these two worlds. He makes it either a\nyoke long on each side, or forty feet,--whichever way he pleases. He then\nthrows sand thereon: the meaning of this has been explained.\n\n7:3:1:2828\\. He throws it on the Uttara-vedi;--the Uttaravedi is the womb: he\nthus infuses seed into the womb; and the seed which is infused into the womb\nbecomes generative. He covers the whole body (of the altar) with that (sand):\nhe thus puts seed into the whole body 2; whence the seed is produced from the\nwhole body.\n\n7:3:1:2929\\. [He throws it on the high-altar, with Va _g_. S. XII, 106-I11;\n_Ri_ k S. X, 140] 'Thine, O Agni, is glory and vigour,'--his glory ( _s_\nravas) and vigour doubtless is the smoke, for that announces ( _s_ ravaya) him\nin yonder world,--'mighty shine forth the\n\np. 350\n\nflames, O rich-beamed one!' that is, 'the flames of (thee), the mighty one,\nshine forth, O thou, abounding in wealth!'--'With might, O wide-rayed one\n(thou bestowest) strength, worthy of song,' might is power: thus, 'By (thy)\npower, O wide-rayed one, (thou givest) food worthy of song;'--'bestowest thou\nupon the worship, O sage!' worship doubtless is the Sacrificer: thus, 'Upon\nthe worship thou bestowest, O sage!'\n\n7:3:1:3030\\. 'Pure-flamed, bright-flamed,' for pure-flamed and bright-flamed\nhe (Agni) is; 'full-flamed, didst thou burst forth with light,' that is,\n'full-flamed shonest thou forth with light;'--'running about as their son thou\nhelpest the two mothers,' for as their son he does help the two\nmothers;--'thou fillest both spheres,' the two spheres doubtless are these\ntwo, heaven and earth, and these two he indeed fills,--with smoke yonder\n(sky), with rain this (earth).\n\n7:3:1:3131\\. 'Child of strength, knower of beings, in benedictions,' that is,\n'child of strength, knower of beings, in praises,'--'delight thou, kindly in\nthoughts,' that is, 'shine thou, kindly in thoughts;'--'in thee have they\nbrought together multiform nourishments,' that is, 'in thee have they brought\ntogether many-formed nourishments;'--'of wondrous help are the fair-born,' as\nthe text, so the meaning.\n\n7:3:1:3232\\. 'Ruling, O Agni, spread thou by beings'--the beings are men:\nthus, 'Shining, O Agni, spread thyself by men!'--'riches amongst us, O\nimmortal!' that is, 'bestowing wealth upon us, O immortal!'--'Of beautiful\nform, shinest thou'--for he indeed shines, of beautiful form;--'thou\n\np. 351\n\nfillest (us with) profitable 1 wisdom;' that is, thou fillest (us with)\nperennial wisdom.'\n\n7:3:1:3333\\. 'Him, the wise arranger of the cult,'--the cult is the sacrifice:\nthus, 'him, the wise preparer of the sacrifice;'--'ruling over great wealth,'\nthat is, 'ruling in great wealth;'--'the bestowal of good things,--prosperous,\nmighty (mah) nourishment,'--that is, 'the bestowal of good things; prosperous,\nample (mahat) nourishment,'--'givest thou, and profitable substance,' that is,\n'givest thou, and perennial substance.'\n\n7:3:1:3434\\. '[Thee,] the righteous,' that is, the truthful;'--'the mighty,'\nthe mighty (or buffalo) doubtless is Agni;--'the all-remarkable,' for he\n(Agni) is indeed remarkable to all;--'(thee), Agni, men have placed foremost\nfor happiness,' happiness doubtless is the sacrifice, and for the sacrifice\nthey indeed place him foremost;--'thee, the hearer, the far-ruling, divine\none, with song the human tribes;' that is, 'thee who hearest, thee, the far-\nruling god, we men invoke.'\n\n7:3:1:3535\\. Now this hymn of six verses is that same Agni Vai _s_ vanara; and\nit is in order to make a beginning (in the building of the altar) that that\nsand is scattered,--he thereby pours into it Agni Vai _s_ vanara as seed;--(he\ndoes so) with a six-versed hymn: six seasons are a year and the year is Vai\n_s_ vanara (belonging to all men).\n\n7:3:1:3636\\. As to this they say, 'If the seed is said to be seed what is its\nseed characteristic?'--Let him say, 'white;' for seed is white;--or\n'speckled,' for seed is, as it were, speckled.\n\np. 352\n\n7:3:1:3737\\. As to this they say, 'As seed is moist, and he scatters dry sand,\nhow does it become moist for him, after the manner of seed?' Well, the metres\nare vital sap, and vital sap is moist; and inasmuch as he scatters that (sand)\nwith metres, it is thus that it becomes moist for him, after the manner of\nseed.\n\n7:3:1:3838\\. As to this they say, 'How does it come to be put on for him by\nmeans of the day and the night?' Well, day and night are two, and there are\ntwo (kinds of) seed, the white and the black: as black and white it is thus\nput on for him by means of the day and the night.\n\n7:3:1:3939\\. As to this they say, 'How does that (sand), put on by the days\nand nights, become complete (or perfect) for him, neither deficient, nor\nsuperabundant?' Well, endless are the days and nights, and endless is the\nsand: it is thus that, put on by the days and nights, it becomes complete for\nhim, neither deficient, nor superabundant. 'And wherefrom (is obtained) the\noceanic (Samudriya 1) metre?' The ocean is endless, and the sand is endless:\nthat is the oceanic metre.\n\n7:3:1:4040\\. As to this they say, 'How is that (sand) of his put on separately\nwith different prayers?' Well, prayer is thought; this thought, prayer, comes\nto be equal to the whole sand 2: and thus that (sand) of his comes to be put\non separately with different prayers.\n\n7:3:1:4141\\. As to this they say, 'How does that (sand) of his come to be put\non by all the metres?'--Inasmuch as he scatters it with that hymn of six\nverses; for as many syllables as there are in the\n\np. 353\n\nseven metres, so many syllables there are in that hymn of six verses 1: thus\nthat (sand) of his comes to be put on by all the metres.\n\n7:3:1:4242\\. And as to why he scatters sand,--that Agni (fire-altar) is Pra\n_g_ apati, and Pra _g_ apati is the whole Brahman. Now that sand is (put) in\n(the place of) the lost part of the Brahman; and that part of it which has not\nbeen lost is this fire-altar which is now being built: thus when he scatters\nsand he restores to him that lost part of the Brahman. That (sand which) he\nscatters is unnumbered, unlimited; for who knows how great is that lost part\nof the Brahman? And verily he who, knowing this, scatters sand, restores the\nwhole, complete Pra _g_ apati.\n\n7:3:1:4343\\. As to this they say, 'What is the number of these unnumbered sand\ngrains?' Let him say, 'Two;' for there are two kinds of sand, the white and\nthe black; or let him say, 'Seven hundred and twenty,' for so many days and\nnights there are in the year; or 'Two hundred and fifty-two,' for so many\nsyllables there are in that hymn of six verses; or 'Twenty-five,' for seed is\ntwenty-fivefold 2.\n\n7:3:1:4444\\. This same (sand represents) bricks with special prayers: he\nplaces it on the body (of the altar), not\n\np. 354\n\non the wings and tail; for bricks with special prayers are placed on the body,\nnot on the wings and tail. He does not 'settle' it, lest he should stop the\nseed, and generation.\n\n7:3:1:4545\\. He then strokes it (the sand) even by means of two verses\ncontaining the verb 'to grow:' he thereby causes that infused seed to grow,\nwhence the seed infused into the womb grows;--with two (verses) relating to\nSoma (he strokes the sand); for Soma is breath: he thus puts breath into the\nseed; whence the infused seed becomes possessed of breath. But, indeed, were\nit to come forth without breath it would become putrid; and this indeed is the\nSudadohas 1 in this case; for Soma is breath, and the Sudadohas is breath.\n\n7:3:1:4646\\. [Va _g_. S. XII, 112, 113; _Ri_ k S. I, 91, 16, 18] 'Grow thou!\nlet manly power gather in thee from all sides, O Soma!' manly power doubtless\nis seed: thus, 'Grow thou! let seed gather in thee from every side, O\nSoma!'--'Be thou in the gathering of strength!' in food doubtless is strength:\nthus, 'be thou in the gathering of food!'--'Let the drinks, let the forces\ngather in thee!'--drink doubtless means vital sap, and in food are forces:\nthus, let vital sap, let food gather itself in thee!'--'and manly powers in\nthee, the overcomer of enemies;' that is, 'and seed in thee, the overcomer of\nevil;'--'growing, O Soma, for the sake of immortality,' he thereby lays\nimmortality into the generative power, whence generative power is\nimmortal;--'gain thou the highest glory in the heavens!' his highest glory\n\np. 355\n\nin the heavens doubtless is the moon, for that one causes him to be celebrated\nin yonder world 1. With two (verses) he makes him grow, a gayatri and a trish\n_t_ ubh one,--the significance of this has been explained.\n\n7:3:1:4747\\. Now then the (mystic) correspondence,--four clod-bricks he puts\non; with a six-versed (hymn) he scatters (the sand); with two (verses) he\nmakes (the seed) grow; that makes twelve,--twelve months are a year, and the\nyear is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does\nthis become.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[342:1](sbe4161.htm#fr_647) That is, in performing the various rites of the\nSoma-sacrifice, p. 343 and at the same time doing all that is necessary for\nthe building of the fire-altar, on which the Soma-offering itself is\nultimately to be performed.\n\n[343:1](sbe4161.htm#fr_648) Viz. in consecrating the site of the \xc3\x82havaniya, as\nwell as that of the Garhapatya altar (see [VII, 1, 1,\n1](sbe4155.htm#7:1:1:1)).\n\n[344:1](sbe4161.htm#fr_649) [VII, 1, 1, 14](sbe4155.htm#7:1:1:14).\n\n[344:2](sbe4161.htm#fr_650) See paragraphs [45](sbe4161.htm#7:3:1:45),\n[46](sbe4161.htm#7:3:1:46).\n\n[345:1](sbe4161.htm#fr_651) He places a clod of earth on each end of the two\n'spines,' that is to say, in the middle of each of the four sides of the\nsquare constituting the 'body' of the altar-site.\n\n[345:2](sbe4161.htm#fr_652) Or, when they put him together (by building the\nfire-altar).\n\n[346:1](sbe4161.htm#fr_653) Viz. when these worlds were plunged into the\nwater, see [VI, 1, 1, 12](sbe4128.htm#6:1:1:12).\n\n[347:1](sbe4161.htm#fr_654) Viz. from some place towards north-west from the\nmiddle of the western side of the body of the altar.\n\n[347:2](sbe4161.htm#fr_655) Mahidhara takes 'adam' here as the regular\nimperfect of 'ad,' I ate.\n\n[348:1](sbe4161.htm#fr_656) See [p. 301](sbe4155.htm#page_301), note\n[3](sbe4155.htm#fn_563).\n\n[348:2](sbe4161.htm#fr_657) See [p. 153](sbe4129.htm#page_153), note\n[1](sbe4129.htm#fn_306).\n\n[349:1](sbe4161.htm#fr_658) See [p. 325](sbe4157.htm#page_325), note\n[6](sbe4158.htm#fn_619).\n\n[349:2](sbe4161.htm#fr_659) That is to say, he first throws down sand on the\nUttara-vedi, and then covers with it the whole of the body of the altar, so as\nto make it even with the Uttara-vedi.\n\n[351:1](sbe4161.htm#fr_660) The author connects 'sanasi' with 'sanatana' (old,\nperpetual).\n\n[352:1](sbe4161.htm#fr_661) The exact purport of this term is not clear.\n\n[352:2](sbe4161.htm#fr_662) Sikata _h_ , sand, is plural, consisting as it\ndoes of a multiplicity of sand-grains.\n\n[353:1](sbe4161.htm#fr_663) This is a somewhat loose calculation.
