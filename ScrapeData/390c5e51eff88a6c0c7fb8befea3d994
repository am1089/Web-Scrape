They are, in the enumeration of\nNarada, 1. spoiling fruits or the like; 2. injuring more valuable, articles;\n3. offences directed against the life of a human being, and approaching\nanother man's wife. See Narada XIV, 4-6.]\n\np. 49\n\nnor one tormented by hunger or thirst; nor one oppressed by a (sudden)\ncalamity (such as the death of his father or the like), or wholly absorbed in\nevil passions;\n\n3\\. Nor an enemy or a friend; nor one interested in the subject matter; nor\none who does forbidden acts; nor one formerly perjured; nor an attendant;\n\n4\\. Nor one who, without having been appointed, comes and offers his evidence;\n\n5\\. Nor can one man alone be made a witness.\n\n6\\. In cases of theft, of violence, of abuse and assault, and of adultery the\ncompetence of witnesses must not be examined too strictly.\n\n7\\. Now (those who are fit to be) witnesses (shall he enumerated):\n\n8\\. Descendants of a noble race, who are virtuous and wealthy, sacrificers,\nzealous in the practice of religious austerities, having male issue, well\nversed in the holy law, studious, veracious, acquainted with the three Vedas,\nand aged (shall be witnesses).\n\n9\\. If he is endowed with the qualities just mentioned, one man alone can also\nbe made a witness.\n\n10\\. In a dispute between two litigants, the witnesses of that party have to\nbe examined from which the plaint has proceeded.\n\n11\\. Where the claim has been refuted as not agreeing with the facts (as e. g.\nthe sum claimed\n\n[5. According to Nand., who argues from a passage of Narada (5, 37), the use\nof the particle _k_ a implies here, that two witnesses are also not\nsufficient. But the MSS. of Narada exhibit a different reading of the passage\nin question, which reading is supported by the Viramitrodaya.\n\n8\\. The particle _k_ a is used here, according to Nand., who argues from a\npassage of Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya (II, 68), in. order to include liberality among the\nqualities required in a witness.]\n\np. 50\n\nhaving been repaid by the debtor), there the witnesses of the defendant have\nto be examined as well.\n\n12\\. An appointed witness having died or gone abroad, those who have heard his\ndeposition may give evidence.\n\n13\\. (The evidence of) witnesses is (of two kinds): either of what was seen,\nor of what was heard.\n\n14\\. Witnesses are free from blame if they give true evidence.\n\n15\\. Whenever the death of a member of any of the four castes (would be\noccasioned by true evidence, they are free from blame) if they give false\nevidence.\n\n16\\. In order to expiate the sin thus committed, such a witness), if he\nbelongs to a twice-born caste, must pour an oblation in the fire, consecrating\nit with the texts called Kushma _nd_ i.\n\n17\\. If he is a _S_ udra, he must feed ten cows for one day.\n\nIS. A false witness may be known by his altered looks, by his countenance\nchanging colour, and by his talk wandering from the subject.\n\n19\\. Let the judge summon the witnesses, at the time of sunrise, and examine\nthem after having bound them by an oath.\n\n20\\. A Brahma _n_ a he must address thus, 'Declare.'\n\n21\\. A Kshatriya he must address thus, 'Declare the truth.'\n\n[16. Va _g_ asan. Sa _m_ h. XX, 14-16, or Taitt. \xc3\x82ra _n_ y. X, 3-5. Nand.\nconsiders the term Kushma _nd_ i to be used in a general sense here, so as to\ninclude all the other texts mentioned in an analogous passage of Manu (VIII,\n106).]\n\np. 51\n\n22\\. A Vai _s_ ya he must address thus, 'Thy kine, grain, and gold (shall\nyield thee no fruit, if thou wert to give false evidence).'\n\n23\\. A _S_ udra he must address thus, 'Thou shalt have to atone for all\n(possible) heavy crimes (if thou wert to give false evidence).'\n\n24\\. Let him exhort the witnesses (with the following speeches):\n\n25\\. 'Whatever places (of torture) await (the killer of a Brahma _n_ a and\nother) great criminals and (the killer of a cow and other) minor offenders,\nthose places of abode are ordained for a witness who gives false evidence;\n\n26\\. 'And the fruit of every virtuous apt he has done, from the day of his\nbirth to his dying day, shall be lost to him.\n\n27\\. 'Truth makes the sun spread his rays.\n\n28\\. 'Truth makes the moon shine.\n\n29\\. 'Truth makes the wind blow.\n\n30\\. 'Truth makes the earth bear (all that is upon it).\n\n31\\. 'Truth makes waters flow.\n\n32\\. 'Truth makes the fire burn.\n\n33\\. 'The atmosphere exists through truth.\n\n34\\. 'So do the gods.\n\n35\\. 'And so do the offerings.\n\n36\\. 'If veracity and a thousand horse-sacrifices\n\n[22, 23. Nand.'s interpretation of these two Sutras, which has been followed\nabove, does not agree with Kulluka's, of M. VIII, 88. But in another passage\nof Manu (VIII, 113), where the same terms recur, he interprets them like Nand.\n\n36\\. This Sloka is also found in the Mahabharata I, 3095 &c., in the Marka\n_nd_ eya-pura\xc3\xb1a VIII, 42, in the Hitopade _s_ a IV, 129, and, in a somewhat\nmodified form, in the Ramaya _n_ a II, 61, 10. See Bohtlinkg, Ind. Spruche,\n731 &c.]\n\np. 52\n\nare weighed against each other, (it is found that) truth ranks even higher\nthan a thousand horse-sacrifices.\n\n37\\. 'Those who, though acquainted with the facts, and appointed to give\nevidence, stand mute, are equally criminal with, and deserve the same\npunishment as, false witnesses.' (After having addressed them) thus, let. the\nking examine the witnesses in the order of their castes.\n\n38\\. That plaintiff whose statement the witnesses declare to be true, shall\nwin his suit; but he whose statement they declare to be wrong, shall certainly\nlose it.\n\n39\\. If there is contradictory evidence, let the king decide by the plurality\nof witnesses; if equality in number, by superiority in virtue; if parity in\nvirtue, by the evidence of the best among the twice-born.\n\n40\\. Whenever a perjured witness has given false evidence in a suit, (the\nking) must reverse the judgment; and whatever has been done, must be\nconsidered as undone.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IX.](sbe07011.htm)\n\n"
