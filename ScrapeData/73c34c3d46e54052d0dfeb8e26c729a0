I will now inform you, how Shree Krishnu Chund\nraised the hill Goberdhun, and destroyed the pride of Indru: listen with\nattention. All the inhabitants of Bruj, on the anniversary of the fourteenth\nof the dark part of the month of Kartik, having bathed, and filled A square\nplace with saffron and sandal, bringing different kinds of sweetmeats and\nconfectionary, and perfumes and lamps, were in the habit of worshipping Indru.\nThis was a traditional custom with them. On one of the returns of that\nanniversary, Nund Jee made great preparations for a feast, and there were also\ngreat preparations in the houses of all the inhabitants of Bruj. Shree Krishnu\nChund came and asked his mother, "What is the reason of there being so many\nsweetmeats, and so much confectionary in each house to-day? Explain the secret\nto me, that the doubts of my mind may be removed?" Jusodha replied, "Son! I\nhave no leisure now to talk: Go and ask your father, and he will explain to\nyou?"\n\nOn hearing this, Shree Krishnu came to Nund and Oopnund, and said, "Father!\nfor what god\'s worship are such splendid preparations being made to-day, that\nthere are sweetmeats and confectionary in each house? What power has he of\naccomplishing men\'s desires, of granting absolution from sin\n\np. 85\n\nand conferring boons? Explain to me his name, and his virtues, that the doubts\nof my mind may disappear?"\n\nNund said, "Son! have you not yet found out the secret, that it is the worship\n(poojah) of the lord of the clouds, who is the ruler of the gods, through\nwhose benignant liberality, prosperity and increase are obtained in the world,\nand also grass, water and grain. The forests and groves produce flowers and\nfruits: and through him all living things, animals, four-footed beasts and\nbirds have a joyful existence. This custom of performing poojah to Indru has\nobtained from the times of our ancestors\' ancestors, and is not one, which has\nbeen lately introduced."\n\nOn hearing these words from Nund Jee, Shree Krishnu replied, "Father! our\nancestors may with knowledge or without knowledge have worshipped Indru; but\nwhy do you intentionally leave a straight road and follow a steep one? By\nobeying Indru nothing is gained; because he has not the power of granting\nmen\'s desires, or absolution from sin; and who has obtained prosperity and the\naccomplishment of his objects from him: mention to me on whom has he ever\nconferred a boon?\n\n"It is indeed true, that in consequence of his penances and sacrifices, the\ngods made him their Raja, and seated him on a throne, but he has no divine\npower; often (when he is worsted by evil spirits,) he runs away, and passes\nhis time in some hiding place. Why serve such a coward, and why not have\nproper regard for your own dignity of character? Indru has not power to do any\nthing. What is written in fate, happens. Men obtain enjoyment, wealth,\nbenefactors, brothers and relations, as the result of their virtues, or their\nfates. And the sun, which dries up the water for eight months of the year,\ncauses it to fall down in rain for the remaining four. In consequence of this,\ngrass, water and grain are produced on the earth. And Bruhmu, who has formed\nthe four castes, Brahmins, Chutrees, Bys, Soodrus,\n\np. 86\n\nhas attached particular occupations to each; viz., that Brahmins should read\nthe scriptures (Vedas); Chutrees should protect all the others; Bys should\ncarry on agriculture, and trade; and Soodrus should be servants to the three\nother divisions of caste. Father! we belong to the Bys caste; in consequence\nof the number of cows we possess, we obtained the town of Gokool, and thence\nis derived our name of cowherds. Our business is to carry on agriculture and\ntrade, and to attend upon cows and Brahmins. The Vedas command us not to\nabandon our family customs. They, who abandon their own religious customs and\nconform to others, are like a virtuous woman of a good family, who should form\nan attachment to a stranger of another family. Be pleased, therefore, to\nabandon the worship of Indru, and perform poojah to the forests and hills;\nbecause we are inhabitants of the forest, and they are our kings. It is not\nright for us to abandon those, under whose government we live happily, and\nworship others. Wherefore take all the sweetmeats, confectionary and grain,\nand perform poojah to the mountain Goberdhun."\n\nHaving heard these remarks, Nund and Oopnund arose, and went to a place of\nassembly, where all the grown-up cowherds were seated.\n\nOn hearing what Krishnu had said, they remarked, "Krishnu speaks truly, do not\nconsider his words as those of a child, and set them aside. If you yourselves\nconsider well, who is Indru? And why do we treat him with deference? It is\nproper we should worship those who give us sustenance.\n\n"What have we to do with the ruler of the gods; let us worship forests, rivers\nand the hill Goberdhun." The cowherds again said, "Krishnu has given good\ncounsel, let us abandon all the gods; Goberdhun is a great mountain, let us\nworship it."\n\nOn hearing this Nund Jee was delighted, and caused proclamation to be made\nthroughout the village, that on the next day, he and all the inhabitants of\nBruj would go and perform\n\np. 87\n\npoojah to Goberdhun. Having heard this proclamation, all the inhabitants of\nBruj rose very early next morning; and having bathed, and performed their\nreligious meditations, placed all articles necessary for the poojah in\nbaskets, plates, dishes and pots of various kinds, and brought them on carts\nand bhangies to Goberdhun. Nund and Oopnund also with their relatives took a\nstock of things necessary, and accompanied the rest; and advancing in musical\nprocession, they arrived at Goberdhun. On arrival there, having swept and\ncleared the ground all round the hill, and sprinkled water, they selected and\ndeposited all kinds of sweetmeats, food, condiments and pickles: so much\nindeed, that the mountain was concealed by them; and they spread garlands\nabove, and silks of all colours.\n\nThe beauty of the scene at this time is not to be described: the mountain\nappeared as splendid as a person in a jewelled dress, ornamented from head to\nfoot. And Nund Jee having summoned a family priest, and accompanied by all the\ncowherds\' children, placed on the ground the mixture roolee, unbroken rice,\nflowers, perfumes, lamps, consecrated food, pawn, betelnut and sacrificial\npresents, and performed poojah according to the injunctions of the Vedas. Upon\nthis Shree Krishnu said, "Meditate now with pure minds upon the mountain\nGoberdhun, and he will appear and eat with you."\n\nHearing this all the cowherds, together with Nund and Jusodha, stood with\ntheir hands joined, their eyes shut, and in deep meditation. Nund Lal on the\nother hand, having then assumed a huge, monstrous form, with large hands and\nfeet, came forth silently from the middle of the hill, having lotus eyes, a\nface like the moon, a crown and a garland of flowers reaching to his feet,\ndressed in yellow, and wearing jewels and ornamented gems, and with his mouth\nopen. And at. the same time, in his own proper form, looking at his assumed\nform, Krishnu calling out to all his companions said, "Behold! the mountain\nGoberdhun, whose poojah you performed with such sincerity, has manifested\nitself."\n\np. 88\n\nHaving said this, Shree Krishnu Chund Jee made a salutation to Goberdhun. The\ncowherdesses and cowherds, seeing this, did the same, and began to say to each\nother, "When did Indru show himself in this manner? We have worshipped him to\nno purpose: and there is no knowing why our ancestors abandoned so perceptible\na deity as Goberdhun, and obeyed Indru;--there is no understanding this."\nWhilst they were thus talking, Shree Krishnu said, "What are you looking at?\ngive him the food, which you have brought." On hearing this the cowherdesses\nand cowherds filled plates and dishes with food of all kinds, (literally of\nsix flavours,) and began to offer it to Goberdhun, who stretched out his hands\nto receive it, and began eating. At length all that the inhabitants of Bruj,\nand Nund and Jusodha had brought with them was eaten up. The form of Goberdhun\nthen went back to the hill.\n\nHaving finished these wonderful sports, Shree Krishnu Chund, taking all his\ncompanions with him, went round the hill to the right by way of adoration; and\nnext day leaving Goberdhun they arrived at Brindabun, laughing and playing on\nthe road. Then there were rejoicings and festivities in every house; and the\ncowherds\' children, having painted all the cows and calves, and fastened\nrings, small bells and other tinkling ornaments on their necks, engaged in\ngames and sports separately.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXVI](psa27.htm)\n\n'
