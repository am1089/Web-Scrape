Here I wish only to call attention to a well-known passage of Sha _d_\nguru _s_ ishya, in which that commentator gives some statements on the works\ncomposed by \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana and by his teacher _S_ aunaka. As an important\npoint in that passage has, as far as I can see, been misunderstood by several\neminent scholars, I may perhaps be allowed here to try and correct that\nmisunderstanding, though the point stands in a less direct connection with the\nG _ri_ hya-sutra than with another side of the literary activity of \xc3\x82 _s_\nvalayana.\n\nSha _d_ guru _s_ ishya 1, before speaking of \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana, makes the\nfollowing statements with regard to \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana's teacher, _S_ aunaka.\n'There was,' he says, 'the _S_ akala Sa _m_ hita (of the Rig-veda), and the\nBashkala Sa _m_ hita; following these two Sa _m_ hitas and the twenty-one\nBrahma _n_ as, adopting principally the Aitareyaka and supplementing it by the\nother texts, he who was revered by the whole number of great _Ri_ shis\ncomposed the first Kalpa-sutra.' He then goes on to speak of \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana\xc2\x97'\n_S_ aunaka's pupil was the venerable \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana. He who knew everything he\nhad learnt from that teacher, composed a Sutra and announced (to _S_ aunaka\nthat he had done so) 2.' _S_ aunaka then destroyed his own Sutra, and\n\np. 154\n\ndetermined that \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana's Sutra should be adopted by the students of\nthat Vedic _S_ akha. Thus, says Sha _d_ guru _s_ ishya, there were twelve\nworks of _S_ aunaka by which a correct knowledge of the Rig-veda was\npreserved, and three works of \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana. _S_ aunaka's da _s_ a granthas\nwere, the five Anukrama _n_ is, the two Vidbanas, the Barhaddaivata, the Prati\n_s_ akhya, and a Smarta work 1. \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana, on the other hand, composed\nthe _S_ rauta-sutra in twelve Adhyayas, the G _ri_ hya in four Adhyayas, and\nthe fourth \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka: this is \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana's great Sutra composition 2.\n\nHere we have an interesting and important statement by which the authorship of\na part of the Aitareyara _n_ yaka, which would thus be separated from the rest\nof that text, is ascribed, not to Mahidasa Aitareya, but to an author of what\nmay be called the historical period of Vedic antiquity, to \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana.\n\nBut what is the fourth \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka to which this passage refers? Is it the\ntext which is now set down, for instance, in Dr. Ra _g_ endralala Mitra's\nedition, as the fourth \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka of the Aitareyinas?\n\nBefore we give an answer to this question, attention must be called to other\npassages referring, as it could seem, to another part, namely, the fifth part\nof the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka.\n\nSaya _n_ a, in his great commentary on the Rig-veda, very frequently quotes\nthe pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ amara _n_ yaka as belonging to _S_ aunaka. Thus in vol. i, p.\n112, ed. Max Muller, he says: pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ amara _n_ yaka aush _n_ ihat _ri_ _k_\na _s_ itir iti kha _n_ _d_ e _S_ aunakena sutrita _m_ surupak _ri_ tnum utaya\niti tri _n_ y endra sanasi _m_ rayim iti dve iti. There is indeed in the fifth\n\xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka a chapter beginning with the words aush _n_ ihi t _ri_ _k_ a _s_\niti _h_ , in which the words quoted by Saya _n_ a occur 3. Similar quotations,\nin\n\np. 155\n\nwhich the fifth \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka is assigned to _S_ aunaka, are found in Saya _n_\na's commentary on the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka itself; see, for instance, p. 97, line 19,\np. 116, line 3.\n\nThus it seems that the authorship of both the fourth and the fifth \xc3\x82ra _n_\nyaka was ascribed to teachers belonging to the Sutra period of Vedic\nliterature, viz. to _S_ aunaka and to \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana respectively. And so we\nfind the case stated by both Professor Weber, in his 'Vorlesungen uber\nindische Literaturgeschichte 1,' and Dr. Ra _g_ endralala Mitra, in the\nIntroduction to his edition of the Aitareya \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka 2.\n\nBut we must ask ourselves: Are the two books of the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka collection,\nascribed to those two authors, really two different books? It is a surprising\nfact that Sha _d_ guru _s_ ishya, while speaking of \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana's\nauthorship of the fourth book, and while at the same time intending, as he\nevidently does, to give a complete list of _S_ aunaka's compositions, does not\nmention the fifth \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka among the works of that author. In order to\naccount for this omission the conjecture seems to suggest itself that Sha _d_\nguru _s_ ishya, when speaking of the fourth \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka as belonging to \xc3\x82 _s_\nvalayana, means the same work which Saya _n_ a sets down as the fifth, and\nwhich he ascribes to _S_ aunaka. At first sight this conjecture may seem\nperhaps rather hazardous or unnatural; however I believe that, if we compare\nthe two texts themselves which are concerned, we shall find it very probable\nand even evident. What do those two \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka books contain? The fourth is\nvery short: it does not fill more than one page in the printed edition. Its\ncontents consist exclusively of the text of the Mahanamni or _S_ akvari\nverses, which seem to belong to a not less remote\n\np. 156\n\nantiquity than the average of the Rig-veda hymns. They can indeed be\nconsidered as forming part of the Rig-veda Sa _m_ hita, and it is only on\naccount of the peculiar mystical holiness ascribed to these verses, that they\nwere not studied in the village but in the forest 1, and were consequently\nreceived not into the body of the Sa _m_ hita itself, but into the \xc3\x82ra _n_\nyaka. They are referred to in all Brahma _n_ a texts, and perhaps we can even\ngo so far as to pronounce our opinion that some passages of the Rig-veda hymns\nthemselves allude to the _S_ akvari verses:\n\nya _k_ _kh_ akvarishu b _ri_ hata rave _n_ endre _s_ ushmam adadhata Vasish\n_th_ a _h_ (Rig-veda VII, 33, 4).  \n_ri_ ka _m_ tva _h_ posham aste pupushvan gayatra _m_ tvo gayati _s_ akvarishu\n(Rig-veda X, 71, 11).\n\nSo much for the fourth \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka. The fifth contains a description of the\nMahavrata ceremony. To the same subject also the first book is devoted, with\nthe difference that the first book is composed in the Brahma _n_ a style, the\nfifth in the Sutra style 2.\n\nNow which of these two books can it be that Sha _d_ guru _s_ ishya reckons as\nbelonging to the '\xc3\x82 _s_ valayanasutraka?' It is impossible that it should be\nthe fourth, for the Mahanamni verses never were considered by Indian\ntheologians as the work of a human author; they shared in the apaurusheyatva\nof the Veda, and to say that they have been composed by \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana, would\nbe inconsistent with the most firmly established principles of the literary\nhistory of the Veda both as conceived by the Indians and by ourselves. And\neven if we were to admit that the Mahanamni verses can have been assigned, by\nan author like Sha _d_ guru _s_ ishya, to \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana,\xc2\x97and we cannot admit\n\np. 157\n\nthis,\xc2\x97there is no possibility whatever that he can have used the expression '\xc3\x82\n_s_ valayanasutrakam' with regard to the Mahanamnis; to apply the designation\nof a Sutra to the Mahanamni hymn would be no less absurd than to apply it to\nany Sukta whatever of the _Ri_ k-Sa _m_ hita. On the other hand, the fifth\nbook of the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka is a Sutra; it is the only part of the whole body of\nthe \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka collection which is composed in the Sutra style. And it\ntreats of a special part of the Rig-veda ritual the rest of which is embodied\nin its entirety, with the omission only of that very part, in the two great\nSutras of \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana. There seems to me, therefore, to be little doubt as\nto the fifth \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka really being the text referred to by Sha _d_ guru\n_s_ ishya, though I do not know how to explain his setting down this book as\nthe fourth. And I may add that there is a passage, hitherto, as far as I know,\nunnoticed, in Saya _n_ a's Sama-veda commentary, in which that author directly\nassigns the fifth \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka not, as in the Rig-veda commentary, to _S_\naunaka, but to \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana. Saya _n_ a there says 1: yatha bahv _ri_ kam\nadhyapaka mahavrataprayogapratipadakam \xc3\x82 _s_ valayananirmita _m_ kalpasutram\nara _n_ ye\xe0\xa4\xbddhiyamana _h_ pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ amam ara _n_ yakam iti vedatvena\nvyavaharanti.\n\nInstead of asserting, therefore, that of the two last \xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas of the\nAitareyinas the one is ascribed to _S_ aunaka, the other to \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana, we\nmust state the case otherwise: not two \xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas were, according to Saya\n_n_ a and Sha _d_ guru _s_ ishya, composed by those Sutrakaras, but one, viz.\nthe fifth, which forms a sort of supplement to the great body of the Sutras of\nthat _K_ ara _n_ a, and which is ascribed either to _S_ aunaka or to \xc3\x82 _s_\nvalayana. Perhaps further research will enable us to decide whether that Sutra\nportion of the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka, or we may say quite as well, that \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka\nportion of the Sutra, belongs to the author of the _S_ rauta-sutra, or should\nbe considered as a remnant of a more ancient composition, of which the portion\nstudied in the forest has survived, while the portion\n\np. 158\n\nwhich was taught in the village was superseded by the more recent \xc3\x82 _s_\nvalayana-sutra.\n\nThere would be still many questions with which an Introduction to \xc3\x82 _s_\nvalayana would have to deal; thus the relation between \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana and _S_\naunaka, which we had intended to treat of here with reference to a special\npoint, would have to be further discussed with regard to several other of its\nbearings, and the results which follow therefrom as to the position of \xc3\x82 _s_\nvalayana in the history of Vedic literature would have to be stated. But we\nprefer to reserve the discussion of these questions for the General\nIntroduction to the G _ri_ hya-sutras.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[153:1](sbe29099.htm#fr_349) See Max Muller's History of Ancient Sanskrit\nLiterature, pp. 230 seqq.; Indische Studien, I, 102.\n\n[153:2](sbe29099.htm#fr_350) This seems to me to be the meaning of sutra _m_ k\n_ri_ tva nyavedayat; p. 154 the case is similar to that where a pupil goes on\nhis rounds for alms and announces (nivedayati) to his teacher what he has\nreceived.
