He also was willing to\nsurrender his belief in the divine revelation of the Brahma _n_ as,\n\np. 13\n\nthough he retained it in full strength with regard to the Vedic hymns. He\npublished large commentaries on the Vedas, which show great familiarity with\nSanskrit and very wide reading, though at the same time an utter want of\ncritical judgement. He sanctioned the remarriage of widows, supported the\nmovement in favour of raising the marriageable age of boys and girls, and\naltogether showed himself free from many prejudices as to caste, food, and all\nthe rest. He condemned idolatry and even polytheism. His name became better\nknown in Europe also, from the time that he fell into the net spread for him\nby Madame Blavatsky. But this lasted for a short time only, and when he\nperceived what her real objects were, the Sa _m_ nyasin would have nothing\nmore to say to her. She was not quite the Maitreyi he had expected. He did not\nknow English, she did not know Bengali or Sanskrit; hence they did not\nunderstand each other at first, while later on, as some people said, they\nunderstood each other but too well. However that may be, he certainly seems to\nhave been a powerful disputant, his influence became greater and greater, till\nat last his opponents, the orthodox and unchanging Brahmans, were suspected of\nhaving poisoned their dangerous rival. He died suddenly, but his followers,\nunder the name of \xc3\x82rya-Samaj, form still a very important and growing sect in\nIndia, that keeps aloof from all European influences.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pawari Baba](rls09.htm)\n\n'
