Dharma Raja Yama said :-- O Fair One! If, in this Bharata, any murderer,\nmerciless and fierce, kills any man, out of greed for money, he goes and\nmiserably dwells in the Asipattra hell for fourteen Indra\xc2\x92s life periods. And\nif that murderer kills a Brahma _n_ a, he lives in that hell for one hundred\nmanvantaras. While in hell, his body becomes fiercely cut and wounded by the\nswords. There My messengers chastise him and beat him and he cries aloud and\npasses his time without any food. Then he becomes born for one hundred years\nas a Manthana insect, for hundred births as a boar, for seven births as a\ncock; for seven births as a fox, for seven births as a tiger; for three\nbirths, as a wolf; for seven births, as a frog; then as a buffalo when he\nbecomes freed of his sins of murders. If anybody sets fire to a city or a\nvillage, he will have to live in K _s_ uradhara Ku _nd_ a for three yugas with\nhis body severed. Then he becomes a Preta (disembodied spirit) and travels\nover the whole earth, being burnt up with fire. For seven births he eats\nunclean and unholy food and spends his time as a pigeon. Then for seven births\nhe becomes diseased with a severe colic pain, for seven births as a leper;\nwhen ultimately he gets a pure human body. If anybody whispers in one\xc2\x92s ear\nanother\xc2\x92s calumny and thus glorifies himself and abuses and vilifies the Devas\nand Brahma _n_ as, he goes and remains in Suchi Ku _nd_ a for three Yugas, and\nhe is pierced there by needles. Then he becomes a scorpion for seven births, a\nserpent for seven births, and an insect (Bha _s_ ma Ki _t_ a) for seven\nbirths; then he gets a diseased human body when, at last, he becomes purified.\nIf anybody breaks into another\xc2\x92s house and steals away all the household\narticles, cows, goats or buffaloes, he goes to Goka Mukha Ku _nd_ a where\nfaeces are\n\n\n\np. 935\n\n\n\nlike cow\xc2\x92s hoofs, there, beaten by My servants, for three Yugas. (Goka is Gok\n_s_ ura, hoof of a cow). Then, for seven births, he becomes a diseased cow;\nfor three births, a sheep; for three births, a goat; and finally he becomes a\nman. But in this man-birth he is born first as diseased, poor, deprived of\nwife and friends, and a repenting person; when ultimately he is freed of his\nsin. If anybody steals any ordinary thing, he goes to Nakra Mukha Ku _nd_ a\nand lives there for three years, greatly tormented by My messengers. Next for\nseven births, he becomes a diseased ox. Then he attains a very diseased man-\nbirth, and ultimately he is freed of his sins. Such are the horrible results.\nIf anybody kills a cow, elephant, horse, or cuts a tree, he goes to Gaja\nDams\xc2\x92a Ku _nd_ a for three yugas. There he is punished by My messengers freely\nby the teeth of elephants. Then he attains three elephants\xc2\x92 births, three\nhorse-births; then he becomes born as a cow and ultimately he is born a\nMlechcha when he becomes pure. If anybody obstructs any thirsty cow from\ndrinking water, he goes to Krimi Ku _nd_ a and Gomukha Ku _nd_ a filled with\nhot water and lives there for one manvantara. Next when he attains a human\nbirth he owns not any cattle nor any wealth; rather he is born as a man, very\nmuch diseased, in low castes, for seven births when he becomes freed. If\nanybody, being born in Bharata, kills cows, Brahmi _n_ s, women, beggars,\ncauses abortions or goes to those not fit to be gone into, he lives in the\nKumbhipaka hell for fourteen Indra\xc2\x92s life periods. There be is pulverised\nalways by My messengers. He is made to fall sometimes in fire, sometimes over\nthorns, sometimes in hot oil, sometimes in hot water, sometimes in molten iron\nor copper. That great sinner gets thousand vulture births, hundred boar\nbirths, seven crow births and seven serpent births. He then becomes worms of\nfaeces for sixty thousand years. Thus travelling frequently in ox births he at\nlast becomes born as a very poor leper.\n\n\n\n29-31. Savitri said :-- \xc2\x93O Bhagavan! What is, according to the S\xc2\x92astras,\nBrahmahattya (murdering a Brahmin) and Gohatya (killing a cow)? Who are called\nAgamyas (women unfit to be approached)? Who are designated as void of Sandhya\n(daily worship of the twice born castes)? Who can be called uninitiated? Who\nare said to take Pratigrahas (gifts) in a Tirath? What are the characteristics\nof a real Gramayaji (village priests), Devala, (Brahma _n_ a of an inferior\norder who subsists upon the offerings made to the images which he attends),\nthe cook of a S\xc2\x92udra, of one who is infatuated (Pramatta) and the Vri _s_\nalipati (one who has married an unmarried girl twelve years old in whom\nmenstruation has commenced; a barren woman). Kindly describe all these to me.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\np. 936\n\n\n\n32-91. Dharmarajan said :-- O Fair Savitri! If anybody makes a distinction\nbetween Kri _sn_ a and His Image or between any Deva and his image, between\nS\xc2\x92iva and His phallic emblem, between the Sun and the stone Surya Kanta (a\nprecious stone of a bright and glittering colour) between Ganes\xc2\x92a and Durga,\nhe is said to be guilty of the sin Brahmahattya. If anybody makes any\ndifference (superiority or inferiority) between his own I _s_ ta Deva (his\nDeity), his Spiritual Teacher, his natural father, and mother, is certainly\ninvolved in the sin of Brahmahattya. He who shews any difference (superiority\nor inferiority) between the devotees of Vi _sn_ u and those of other Devas, is\nsaid to commit Brahmahattya. He who makes any difference in matters of respect\nbetween the waters of the feet of any Brahma _n_ a and those of S\xc2\x92alagrama\nstone, is said to commit Brahmahattya. The difference between the offerings to\nHari and Hara leads to Brahmahattya. He who shews any difference between Kri\n_sn_ a, Who is verily the God of gods, the Cause of all causes, the Origin of\nall, Who is worshipped by all the Devas, Who is the Self of all, Who is\nattributeless and without a second yet Who by His Magic powers assumes many\nforms and who is Is\xc2\x92ana, is said to commit, indeed, the Brahmahattya. If any\nVai _sn_ ava (a devotee of Vi _sn_ u) abuses and envies a S\xc2\x92akta (a devotee of\nS\xc2\x92akti), he commits Brahmahattya. He who does not worship, according to the\nVedas, the Pitris and the Devas or prohibits others in doing so, commits\nBrahmahattya. He who abuses Hri _s_ ikes\xc2\x92a, Who is the Highest of the Holy\nthings, Who is Knowledge and Bliss and Who is Eternal, Who is the only God to\nbe served by the Devas and Vai _sn_ avas, and those Who are worshippers of His\nMantra, and those who do not worship themselves are said to commit\nBrahmahattya. He who abuses and vilifies Mulaprakriti Maha Devi, Who is of the\nnature of Causal Brahma (Kara _n_ a Brahma), Who is All Power and the Mother\nof all, Who is worshipped by all and who is of the nature of all the Devas and\nthe Cause of all Causes, Who is \xc3\x82dya S\xc2\x92akti Bhagavati, is said to commit\nBrahmahattya. He who does not observe the Holy S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a Janma _st_ ami,\nS\xc2\x92ri Rama Navami, S\xc2\x92ivaratri, the Ekadas\xc2\x92i happening on Sunday, and five other\nholy Parva _n_ as (festivals), commits Brahmahattya; is considered more sinful\nthan a Cha _nd_ ala. He who in this land of Bharata, digs earth on the day of\nAmbuvachi or makes water, etc., in the waters of the tanks, is involved in the\nsin of Brahmahattya. He who does not support his spiritual teacher, mother,\nfather, chaste wife, son and daughter, though they are faultless, commits\nBrahmahattya. He whose marriage does not take place during his whole life-\ntime, who does not see the face of his son, who does not cherish devotion to\nHari, who eats things unoffered to S\xc2\x92ri Hari, who never worshipped throughout\nhis life Vi _sn_ u or an earthen symbol of S\xc2\x92iva, verily commits Brahmahattya.\nO Fair One! Now I will\n\n\n\np. 937\n\n\n\nrecite the characteristics, according to the S\xc2\x92astras, of Gohattya (killing a\ncow). Listen. If anybody does not prohibit one, seeing one to beat a cow, or\nif he goes between a cow and a Brahmi _n_ , he is involved in the sin of\nGohattya. If any illiterate Brahma _n_ , carrying an ox, daily beats with a\nstick, the cows, certainly he commits the Gohattya. If anybody gives the\nremains of another\xc2\x92s meal to a cow to eat, or feeds a Brahmi _n_ who carries,\nrather moves or drives, cows and oxen; or eats himself the food of such a\nBrahmi _n_ driver, he commits Gohattya. Those who do sacrifices of the husband\nof a barren woman (Vri _s_ ali) or eat his food, commit sin equal to one\nhundred Gohattyas; there is no doubt in this. Those who touch fire with their\nfeet, beat the cows or enter the temple bathing but not washing their feet,\ncommit Gohattya. Those who eat without washing their feet or those who sleep\nwith their feet wetted with water and those who eat just after the Sun has\nrisen, commit Gohattya. Those who eat the food of women without husbands or\nsons or the food of pimps and pampers or those who do not perform their\nSandhyas thrice, commit Gohattya. If any woman makes any difference between\nher husband and the Devata, or chastises and uses harsh words to her husband,\nshe commits Gohattya. If anybody destroys cow\xc2\x92s pasture land, tanks, or land\nfor forts and cultivates there grains, he commits Gohattya. He who does not do\nPrayas\xc2\x92chitta (expiation, atonement) for the expiation of the sin of Gohattya\ndone by his son (for fear of his son\xc2\x92s life), commits the sin himself. If any\ntrouble arises in the state or from the Devas, and if any master does not\nprotect then his own cows, rather torments them, he is said to commit\nGohattya. If any Jiva oversteps the image of a Deva, fire, water, offerings to\na god, flowers, or food, he commits the great sin Brahmahattya. When a guest\ncomes, if the master of the house always says, \xc2\x93there is nothing, nothing with\nme; no, no,\xc2\x94 and if he be a liar, cheat and an abuser of the Devas, he commits\nthe above sin. O fair One! Whoever seeing his spiritual teacher, and a Brahma\n_n_ , does not bow down and make respectful obeisance to them, commits\nGohattya. If any Brahmi _n_ , out of sheer anger, does not utter blessings to\na man who bows down or does not impart knowledge to a student, he commits\nGohattya. O Fair One! Thus I have described to you the characteristics,\napproved by S\xc2\x92astras, of cow-killing (Gohattya) and murdering a Brahmi _n_\n(Brahmahattya). Now hear which women are (Agamyas) not fit to be approached\nand those which are fit to be approached (Gamyas). One\xc2\x92s own wife is fit to be\napproached (Gamya) and all other women are Agamyas, so the Pundits, versed in\nthe Vedas, declare. This is a general remark; now hear everything in\nparticular. O Chaste One! The Brahmi _n_ wives of S\xc2\x92udras or the S\xc2\x92udra wives\nof Brahma _n_ as are Atyagamyas (very\n\n\n\np. 938\n\n\n\nunfit to be approached) and blameable both in the Vedas and in the society. A\nS\xc2\x92udra going to a Brahma _n_ i woman commits one hundred Brahmahattyas; so a\nBrahma _n_ a woman going to a S\xc2\x92udra goes to the Kumbhipaka hell. As a S\xc2\x92udra\nshould avoid a Brahma _n_ i, so a Brahma _n_ a should avoid a S\xc2\x92udra woman. A\nBrahma _n_ a going to a S\xc2\x92udra woman is recognised a Bri _s_ alipati (one who\nhas married an unmarried girl twelve years old in whom menstruation has\ncommenced). So much so that that Brahma _n_ a is considered an outcast and the\nvilest of the Cha _nd_ alas. The offerings of Pi _nd_ as by him are considered\nas faeces and water offered by him is considered as urine. Nowhere whether in\nthe Devaloka or in the Pitriloka, his offered Pi _nd_ as and water are\naccepted. Whatever religious merits he has acquired by worshipping the Devas,\nand practising austerities for Ko _t_ i births, he loses all at once by the\ngreed of enjoying the S\xc2\x92udra woman. There is no doubt in this. A Brahmi _n_ ,\nif he drinks wine, is considered as the husband of a Vri _s_ ali, eating\nfaeces. And if he be a Vai _sn_ ava, a devotee of Vi _sn_ u, his body must be\nbranded with the marks of a Taptamudra (hot seal); and if he be a S\xc2\x92aiva, his\nbody is to be branded with the Tapta S\xc2\x92ula (hot trident). The wife of a\nspiritual teacher, the wife of a king, step-mother, daughter, son\xc2\x92s wife,\nmother-in-law, sister of the same father and mother, the wife of one\xc2\x92s brother\n(of the same father and mother), the wife of a maternal uncle, the father\xc2\x92s\nmother, mother\xc2\x92s mother, the mother\xc2\x92s sister, sisters, the brother\xc2\x92s daughter,\nthe female disciple, the disciple\xc2\x92s wife, the wife of the sister\xc2\x92s son, the\nwife of the brother\xc2\x92s son, these all are mentioned by Brahma as Atyagamyas\n(very unfit to be approached). The people are hereby warned. If anybody,\noverpowered by passion, goes to these Atyagamya women, he becomes the vilest\nof men. The Vedas consider him as if going to his mother and he commits one\nhundred Brahmahattya sins. These have no right to do any actions. They are not\nto be touched by any. They are blamed in the Vedas, in the society everywhere.\nUltimately they go to the dreadful Kumbhipaka hells. O Fair One! He who\nperforms Sandhyas wrongly or reads it wrongly or does not perform at all the\nthree Sandhyas daily, is called as void of Sandhya. He is said to remain\nuninitiated who does not, out of sheer vanity, receive any Mantra, whether he\nbe a Vai _sn_ avite, S\xc2\x92aivite, or a Sun worshipper or the Ganes\xc2\x92a worshipper.\nWhere there is the running stream of the Ganges, lands on either side, four\nhands in width, are said to be the womb of the Ganges (Ganga Garbha) Bhagavan\nNaraya _n_ a incessantly dwells there. This is called the Naraya _n_ a (K _s_\netra). One goes to Vi _sn_ upada who dies in such a place. Vara _n_ asi\n(Benares), Vadari, the Confluence of the Ganges with the ocean (Ganga-Sagara),\nPu _s_ kara, Hari Hara K _s_ ettra (in Behar near Chapra), Prabhasa,\n\n\n\np. 939\n\n\n\nKamarupa, Hardwar, Kedara, Matripura, the banks of the river Sarasvati, the\nholy land Bindraban, Godavari, Kaus\xc2\x92iki, Trive _n_ i (Allahabad), and the\nHimalayas are all famous places of pilgrimages. Those who willingly accept\ngifts in these sacred places are said to be Tirthapratigrahis (the acceptors\nof the gifts in the Tirtha). These Tirthaprathigrahis go in the end to\nKumbhipaka hell. The Brahma _n_ a who acts as priest to the S\xc2\x92udras is called\nS\xc2\x92udrayaji; the village priests are called Gramayajis. Those who subsist on\nthe offerings made to the gods are called Devalas. The cooks of the S\xc2\x92udras\nare called Supakaras. Those who are void of Sandhya Bandanams are called\nPramattas (mad). O Bhadre! These are the marks of the Vri _s_ alipatis that I\nhave (now) enumerated. These are the Great Sinners (Maha Patakas). They go\nultimately to the Kumbhipaka hell. O Fair One! I now state by and by the other\nKu _nd_ as (hells) when other people go. Listen.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Thirty fourth Chapter of the Ninth Book on the description of\nthe various hells in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000\nverses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 35](bk09ch35.htm)\n\n'
