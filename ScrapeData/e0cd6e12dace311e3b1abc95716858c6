'What is the origin of this world?' 'Ether 1, 'he replied. For all these\nbeings take their rise from the ether, and return into the ether. Ether is\nolder than these, ether is their rest.\n\n2\\. He is indeed the udgitha (Om = Brahman), greater than great (parovariyas),\nhe is without end.\n\nHe who knowing this meditates on the udgitha, the greater than great, obtains\nwhat is greater than great, he conquers the worlds which are greater than\ngreat.\n\n3\\. Atidhanvan _S_ aunaka, having taught this udgitha to Udara-sa _n_ _d_\nilya, said: 'As long as they will know in your family this udgitha, their life\nin this world will be greater than great.\n\n4\\. 'And thus also will be their state in the other world.' He who thus knows\nthe udgitha, and meditates on it thus, his life in this world will be greater\nthan great, and also his state in the other world, yea, in the other world.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[17:1](sbe01030.htm#fr_108) Ether, or we might translate it by space, both\nbeing intended, however, as names or symbols of the Highest Brahman.
