[1894], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n5:5:3\n\n#### THE KE _S_ AVAPAN\xc3\x8eYA.\n\n### THIRD BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n5:5:3:11\\. When he has performed the Consecration-ceremony (Abhishe _k_\naniya), he does not shave his hair. The reason why he does not shave his hair\n(is this):--that collected essence of the waters wherewith he is then\nsprinkled (anointed) is vigour, and it is the hair (of his head) that it\nreaches first when he is sprinkled; hence were he to shave his hair, he would\ncause that glory to fall off from him, and would sweep it away: therefore he\ndoes not shave his hair.\n\n5:5:3:22\\. He does not shave his hair for a year 1,--religious observance is\nof equal measure with the year, hence he does not shave for a year: the Ke _s_\navapaniya 2, namely, is a (day of) praise-singing\n\np. 127\n\n[paragraph continues] (stoma) with the view of the termination of the\nreligious performance.\n\n5:5:3:33\\. Twenty-onefold is (each stotra of) its Morning-service,\nseventeenfold (of) the Midday-service, fifteen-fold (of) the Evening-service,\ntogether with the Uktha (stotras), the Sho _d_ a _s_ in, and (the twelve\nstotras of) the Night-service.\n\n5:5:3:44\\. The Twilight (hymn) 1 is (performed in the) Triv _ri_ t (stoma),\nand with the Rathantara (tune). For the twenty-onefold (stoma) is he that\nburns yonder (the sun); from that twenty-onefold one he (the Sacrificer)\nparts, and descends again to the seventeenfold one; from the seventeenfold one\nto the\n\np. 128\n\nfifteenfold one; and from the fifteenfold one he plants his foot on this firm\nfooting, the Triv _ri_ t (stoma).\n\n5:5:3:55\\. The Rathantara is the P _ri_ sh _th_ a (stotra) 1 of this\n(sacrifice); for the Rathantara is this (earth): it is on her, as on a firm\nfooting, he thereby plants his feet. It is an Atiratra (sacrifice),--the\nAtiratra is a firm footing: therefore it is an Atiratra.\n\n5:5:3:66\\. He only cuts down his hair, but does not shave it; for that\ncollected essence of the waters with which he is sprinkled is vigour, and it\nis the hair that it reaches first when he is sprinkled. Thus were he to shave\noff his hair he would cause that glory to fall off from him, and would sweep\nit away. But when he cuts it down, he attaches that glory to his own self:\ntherefore he only cuts down his hair, but does not shave it. This is for him a\nreligious observance: as long as he lives he does not stand on this (earth\nwith bare feet 2).\n\n5:5:3:77\\. From the throne-seat he slips into the shoes; and on shoes (he\nstands), whatever his vehicle may be, whether a chariot or anything else. For\nverily he who performs the Ra _g_ asuya is high above everything here, and\neverything here is beneath him;--therefore this is for him a religious\nobservance: as long\n\np. 129\n\nas he lives he does not stand on the earth (with bare feet).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[126:1](sbe4125.htm#fr_249) He is, however, allowed to shave his heard.\nAccording to La _t_ y. Sr. IX, 2, 20 seq., he is to pass his nights during the\nyear in the fire-house on a tiger's skin; he is never to enter the village,\nand is constantly to keep up the fire. Nor is any one in his kingdom, except a\nBrahman, to get his hair cut, and even the horses are to remain unclipped.\n\n[126:2](sbe4125.htm#fr_250) The Ke _s_ avapaniya, or 'hair-cutting'\n(sacrifice), the fourth of the seven Soma-sacrifices enjoined for the\ninauguration of a king, is to be performed on the full-moon of _G_ yesh _th_ a\n(about p. 127 May 1), a twelvemonth after the Abhishe _k_ aniya, and is to\ntake the form of the Atiratra- _G_ yotish _t_ oma. As usual, the author only\nalludes to any special peculiarities from the ordinary performance. The\nordinary ascending scale of stomas--viz. the Triv _ri_ t-stoma for the\nBahishpavamana-stotra, the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a for the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya-stotras and\nthe Madhyandina-pavamana; the Saptada _s_ a for the P _ri_ sh _th_ a-stotras,\nand the T _ri_ tiya-pavamana; and the Ekavi _m_ _s_ a-stoma for the Agnish _t_\noma-saman--prescribed for the twelve stotras of the Agnish _t_ oma (part i, p.\n310 seq.), is to be reversed on the present occasion, and the scale of stomas\nis to be a descending one. The succeeding stotras--viz. (13-15) the three\nUktha-stotras; (16) the Sho _d_ a _s_ in; and (17-28) the three rounds of the\nnight service requiring four stotras each--are likewise to be performed in the\nPa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a (or fifteen-versed) stoma, employed for the hymns of the\nevening pressing.\n\n[127:1](sbe4125.htm#fr_251) The Sandhi-stotra, or Twilight hymn, Sama-veda II,\n99-104, is the final stotra of the Atiratra (part ii, p. 398). Each of the\nthree couplets is, as usual, sung as a triplet, the three thus producing the\nnine verses of the Triv _ri_ t-stoma. The Rathantara tune, to which the\ncouplets are to be sung, is given in the Uhyagana (Sama-veda, vol. v, p. 381),\nbut with different verses, viz. Sama-veda I, 30, 31 (abhi tva _s_ ura nonumo),\nthe verses most commonly sung to that famous tune. The chanters' manuals of\nthe Atiratra (e. g. Ind. Off. MS. 1748) accordingly adapt the tune to the\nverses here required (ena vo agni _m_ namaso).\n\n[128:1](sbe4125.htm#fr_252) The first (or Hot _ri_ 's) P _ri_ sh _th_ a-stotra\nat the midday-service is either the Rathantara, Sama-veda II, 30, 31 (as for\ninstance at the Agnish _t_ oma), or B _ri_ hat-saman II, 159-160 (as at the\nUkthya sacrifice). The B _ri_ hat is also ordinarily chanted at the Atiratra,\nbut on the present occasion the Rathantara is to be substituted for it.\n\n[128:2](sbe4125.htm#fr_253) Saya _n_ a interprets this passage so as to imply\ntwo separate injunctions:--'For as long as he lives this (cutting down of his\nhair) is a religious observance for him; and he does not stand on the ground\n(without shoes).' The repetition in the next paragraph, however, renders this\ninterpretation very improbable.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 5, 4. Fourth Brahma _n_ a](sbe4126.htm)\n\n"
