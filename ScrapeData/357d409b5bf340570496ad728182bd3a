What is that Brahman, what is Adhyatma, what is Karma, O best of Purushas?\nWhat is called Adhibhuta, and what Adhidaiva?\n\np. 180\n\n2\\. Who, and in what way, is Adhiyajna here in this body, O destroyer of\nMadhu? And how art Thou known at the time of death, by the self-controlled?\n\nThe Blessed Lord said:\n\n3\\. The Imperishable is the Supreme Brahman. Its dwelling in each individual\nbody is called Adhyatma; the offering in sacrifice which causes the genesis\nand support of beings, is called Karma. 3\n\np. 181\n\n4\\. The perishable adjunct is the Adhibhuta, and the Indweller is the\nAdhidaivata; I alone am the Adhiyajna here in this body, O best of the\nembodied. 4\n\np. 182\n\n5\\. And he, who at the time of death, meditating on Me alone, goes forth,\nleaving the body, attains My Being: there is no doubt about this.\n\n6\\. Remembering whatever object, at the end, he leaves the body, that alone is\nreached by him, O son of Kunti, (because) of his constant thought of that\nobject. 6\n\np. 183\n\n7\\. Therefore, at all times, constantly remember Me, and fight. With mind and\nintellect absorbed, in Me, thou shalt doubtless come to Me. 7\n\n8\\. With the mind not moving towards anything else, made steadfast by the\nmethod of habitual meditation, and dwelling on the Supreme, Resplendent\nPurusha, O son of Pritha, one goes to Him. 8\n\np. 184\n\n9-10. The Omniscient, the Ancient, the Overruler, minuter than an atom, the\nSustainer of all, of form inconceivable, self-luminous like the sun, and\nbeyond the darkness of Maya--he who meditates on Him thus, at the time of\ndeath, full of devotion, with the mind unmoving, and\n\np. 185\n\nalso by the power of Yoga, fixing the whole Prana betwixt the eye-brows, he\ngoes to that Supreme, Resplendent Purusha. 9\n\n11\\. What the knowers of the Veda speak of as Imperishable, what the self-\ncontrolled (Sannyasins), freed from attachment enter, and to gain which goal\nthey\n\np. 186\n\nlive the life of a Brahmacharin, that I shall declare unto thee in brief. 11\n\n12-13. Controlling all the senses, confining the mind in the heart, drawing\nthe Prana into the head, occupied in the practice of concentration, uttering\nthe one-syllabled "Om"--the Brahman, and meditating on Me;--he who so departs,\nleaving the body, attains the Supreme Goal.\n\np. 187\n\n14\\. I am easily attainable by that ever-steadfast Yogin who remembers Me\nconstantly and daily, with a single mind, O son of Pritha.\n\n15\\. Reaching the highest perfection, and having attained Me, the great-souled\nones are no more subject to re-birth--which is the home of pain, and\nephemeral. 15\n\np. 188\n\n16\\. All the worlds, O Arjuna, including the realm of Brahma, are subject to\nreturn, but after attaining Me, O son of Kunti, there is no re-birth. 16\n\n17\\. They who know (the true measure of) day and night, know the day of\nBrahma, which ends in a thousand Yugas, and the night which (also) ends in a\nthousand Yugas. 17\n\np. 189\n\n18\\. At the approach of (Brahma\'s) day, all manifestations proceed from the\nunmanifested state; at the approach of night, they merge verily into that\nalone, which is called the unmanifested.\n\n19\\. The very same multitude of beings (that existed in the preceding day of\nBrahma), being born again and again, merge, in spite of themselves, O son of\nPritha, (into the unmanifested), at the approach of night, and re-manifest at\nthe approach of day. 19\n\np. 190\n\n20\\. But beyond this unmanifested, there is that other Unmanifested, Eternal\nExistence--That which is not destroyed at the destruction of all beings. 20\n\n21\\. What has been called Unmanifested and Imperishable, has been described as\nthe Goal Supreme. That is My highest state, having attained which, there is no\nreturn.\n\np. 191\n\n22\\. And that Supreme Purusha is attainable, O son of Pritha, by whole-souled\ndevotion to Him alone, in Whom all beings dwell, and by Whom all this is\npervaded.\n\n23\\. Now I shall tell thee, O bull of the Bharatas, of the time (path)\ntravelling in which, the Yogis return, (and again of that, taking which) they\ndo not return.\n\np. 192\n\n24\\. Fire, flame, day-time, the bright fortnight, the six months of the\nNorthern passage of the sun, taking this path, the knowers of Brahman go to\nBrahman.\n\n25\\. Smoke, night-time, the dark fortnight, the six months of the Southern\npassage of the sun--taking this path the Yogi, attaining the lunar light,\nreturns. 25\n\np. 193 p. 194 p. 195\n\n26\\. Truly are these bright and dark paths of the world considered eternal:\none leads to non-return; by the other, one returns. 26\n\n27\\. No Yogi, O son of Pritha, is deluded after knowing these paths.\nTherefore, O Arjuna, be thou steadfast in Yoga, at all times. 27\n\np. 196\n\n28\\. Whatever meritorious effect is declared (in the Scriptures) to accrue\nfrom (the study of) the Vedas, (the performance of) Yajnas, (the practice of)\nausterities and gifts,--above all this rises the Yogi, having known this, and\nattains to the primeval, supreme Abode. 28\n\nThe end of the eighth chapter designated, The Way to the Imperishable Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[180:3](sbg13.htm#fr_179) _Offering in sacrifice_ --includes here all virtuous\nworks.\n\n_Karma:_ Cf.

Some are inclined to think that each of the steps\nmeans a sphere; while others, a state of consciousness. Still others think,\nthat the series beginning with fire means developing states of illumination\nand renunciation, and that beginning with smoke, increasing states of\nignorance and attachment. p. 193\n\nThe two paths, Devayana and Pitriyana, by which the souls of the dead are\nsupposed to travel to the other world according to their deserts are mentioned\nin the Upanishads, prominently in the Chhandogya, V. x. I, 2. Badarayana\ndiscusses these passages in the Brahma Sutras, IV. ii. 18-21. But an\ninteresting light has been thrown upon the question by the late Mr. Tilak\'s\ntheory of the Arctic home of the ancestors of the Aryan race. He has also\ndealt with his subject specially, in a paper of great value which appeared in\n_Prabuddha Bharata_ (Vol. IX. p. 160). Considering the importance of the\ndoctrine and the excellent way in which it has been elucidated by Mr. Tilak,\nwe shall briefly note below the main heads of his argument.\n\nThe words Pitriyana and Devayana are used many times in the Rigveda. But the\ndistinction made in the Upanishads about the soul\'s path, according as a man\ndied during the dark or the bright half of the year, was unknown to the bards\nof the Rigveda, who held the view that the soul of a man always travelled by\nthe Pitriyana road, whatever the time of his death. It is therefore clear that\nthe doctrine of the Upanishads was a later development, probably evolved after\nphysical light and darkness had come to be connected with moral good and evil\nand the dual character of the world was established. Now, if along with this\nwe consider that death during the Southern passage of the sun was regarded as\ninauspicious from the p. 194 Arctic times, we can see how the distinction\narose between the paths of a man\'s soul according as he died in the dark or\nthe bright part of the year.\n\nAs to the series of steps in each path, since Agni was believed to be the only\nleader of the soul on its path, and both paths ended with the passages of the\nsun, the starting and halting points thus settled, it was not difficult to\nfill in the intermediate steps. The dual character of the world is\n[manifested](errata.htm#0) in Agni as flame and smoke. The flame was therefore\nthe starting point of one path and smoke, of the other. Day and night,\nincreasing and decreasing moon, Northern and Southern passages of the sun came\nnext in natural order. The number of steps can easily be increased, and as a\nmatter of fact has been increased in the Kaushitaki and some other Upanishads,\non the same general principle.\n\nAnother point in this connection may be noted. There is nothing in the second\nor Pitriyana path to correspond with Agni, in the first. We must therefore\neither reduce the number of steps in the first path by taking the words "fire"\nand "flame" in appositional relation and translate the same as "fire, that is\nflame," or increase the steps in the second by adding "fire" as one.\n\n[195:26](sbg13.htm#fr_192) The paths are eternal, because Samsara is eternal.\n\n[195:27](sbg13.htm#fr_193) Knowing that one of the paths leads to Samsara and\nthe other to Moksha, the Yogi takes up the one leading to illumination and\nrejects the other\n\n[196:28](sbg13.htm#fr_194) This--the truth imparted by the Lord in answer to\nthe questions of Arjuna at the beginning of the present chapter.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Ninth Chapter.
