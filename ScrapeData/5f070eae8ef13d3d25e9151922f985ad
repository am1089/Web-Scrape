The Brahman\nanswered, 'No, I will not; for if I let you out of the cage you will eat me.'\n\n'O father of mercy,' answered the Tiger, 'in truth that will not. I will never\nbe so ungrateful; only let me out, that I may drink some water and return.'\nThen the Brahman took pity on him, and opened the cage-door; but no sooner had\nhe done so than the Tiger, jumping out, said, 'Now, I will eat you first, and\ndrink the water afterwards.' But the Brahman said, 'Only do not kill me\nhastily. Let us first ask the opinion of six, and if all of them say it is\njust and fair that you should put me to death, then I am willing to die.'--'\nVery well,' answered the Tiger, 'it shall be as you say; we will first ask the\nopinion of six.'\n\nSo the Brahman and the Tiger walked on till they came to a Banyan-tree; and\nthe Brahman said to it, 'Banyan-tree, Banyan-tree, hear and give judgment.'--'\nOn what must I give judgment?' asked the Banyan-tree. 'This Tiger,' said the\nBrahman, 'begged me to let him out of his cage to drink a little water, and he\npromised not to hurt me if I did so; but now that I have let him out he wishes\nto eat me. Is it just that he should do so, or no?'\n\nThe Banyan-tree answered, 'Men often come to take refuge in the cool shade\nunder my boughs from the scorching rays of the sun; but when they have rested,\nthey cut and break my pretty branches, and wantonly scatter the leaves that\nsheltered them. Let the Tiger eat the man, for men are an ungrateful race.'\n\nAt these words the Tiger would have instantly killed the Brahman; but the\nBrahman said, 'Tiger, Tiger, you must not kill me yet, for you promised that\nwe should first hear the judgment of six.'--' Very well,' said the Tiger, and\nthey went on their way. After a little while they met a Camel. 'Sir Camel, Sir\nCamel,' cried the Brahman, 'hear and give judgment. '--' On what shall I give\njudgment?' asked the Camel. And the Brahman related how the Tiger had begged\nhim to open the cage-door, and promised not to eat him if he did so; and how\nhe had afterwards determined to break his word, and asked if that were just or\nnot. The Camel replied, 'When I was young and strong, and could do much work,\nmy master took care of me and gave me good food; but now that I am old, and\nhave lost all my strength in his service, he overloads me, and starves me, and\nbeats me without mercy. Let the Tiger eat the man, for men are an unjust and\ncruel race.'\n\nThe Tiger would then have killed the Brahman, but the latter said, 'Stop,\nTiger, for we must first hear the judgment of six.'\n\nSo they both went again on their way. At a little distance they found a\nBullock lying by the roadside. The Brahman said to him, 'Brother Bullock,\nbrother Bullock, hear and give judgment.'--' On what must I give judgment?'\nasked the Bullock. The Brahman answered, 'I found this Tiger in a cage, and he\nprayed me to open the door and let him out to drink a little water, and\npromised not to kill me if I did so; but when I had let him out he resolved to\nput me to death. Is it fair he should do so or not?' The Bullock said, 'When I\nwas able to work, my master fed me well and tended me carefully, but now I am\nold he has forgotten all I did for him, and left me by the roadside to die.\nLet the Tiger eat the man, for men have no pity.'\n\nThree out of the six had given judgment against the Brahman, but still he did\nnot lose all hope, and determined to ask the other three.\n\nThey next met an Eagle flying through the air, to whom the Brahman cried, 'O\nEagle, great Eagle, hear and give judgment.'--' On what must I give judgment?'\nasked the Eagle. The Brahman stated the case, but the Eagle answered,\n'Whenever men see me they try to shoot me; they climb the rocks and steal away\nmy little ones. Let the Tiger eat the man, for men are the persecutors of the\nearth.'\n\nThen the Tiger began to roar, and said, 'The judgment of all is against you, O\nBrahman!' But the Brahman answered, 'Stay yet a little longer, for two others\nmust first be asked' After this they saw an Alligator, and the Brahman related\nthe matter to him, hoping for a more favourable verdict. But the Alligator\nsaid, 'Whenever I put my nose out of the water, men torment me, and try to\nkill me. Let the Tiger eat the man, for as long as men live we shall have no\nrest.'\n\nThe Brahman gave himself up as lost; but once more he prayed the Tiger to have\npatience, and to let him ask the opinion of the sixth judge. Now the sixth was\na Jackal. The Brahman again told his story, and said to him, 'Mama Jackal,\nMama Jackal, say what is your judgment?' The Jackal answered, 'It is\nimpossible for me to decide who is in the right and who in the wrong, unless I\nsee the exact position in which you were when the dispute began. Show me the\nplace.' So the Brahman and the Tiger returned to the place where they first\nmet, and the Jackal went with them. When they got there, the Jackal said,\n'Now, Brahman, show me exactly where you stood.'--' Here,' said the Brahman,\nstanding by the iron tiger-cage. 'Exactly there, was it?' asked the Jackal.\n'Exactly here,' replied the Brahman. 'Where was the Tiger then?' asked the\nJackal 'In the cage,' answered the Tiger. 'How do you mean?' said the Jackal,\n'how were you within the cage; which way were you looking?'--' Why, I stood\nso,' said the Tiger, jumping into the cage, 'and my head was on this side.'--'\nVery good,' said the Jackal, 'but I cannot judge without understanding the\nwhole matter exactly. Was the cage-door open or shut?'--' Shut, and bolted,'\nsaid the Brahman. 'Then shut and bolt it,' said the Jackal.\n\nWhen the Brahman had done this, the Jackal said, 'Oh, you wicked and\nungrateful Tiger--when the good Brahman opened your cage-door, is to eat him\nthe only return you would make? Stay there, then, for the rest of your days,\nfor no one will ever let you out again. Proceed on your journey, friend\nBrahman. Your road lies that way, and mine this.'\n\nSo saying, the Jackal ran off in one direction, and the Brahman went rejoicing\non his way in the other.\n\n![](img/31.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XV.
