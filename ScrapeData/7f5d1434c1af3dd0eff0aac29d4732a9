The annual (term for studying the Veda) begins on the full moon of the\nmonth Srava _n_ a (July-August); or let him perform the Upakarman on 1\n\np. 260\n\n(the full moon of) Bhadrapada (August-September) and study the Vedic texts,\n\n2\\. During four months and a half, or during five months, or as long as the\nsun moves towards the South. 2\n\n3\\. Let him remain chaste, let him not shave, nor eat flesh (during that\nperiod); 3\n\n4\\. Or (this) restrictive rule may (be observed) during two months.\n\n5\\. He shall not recite the Veda, if the wind whirls up the dust in the day-\ntime, 5\n\n6\\. Nor if it is audible at night,\n\n7\\. Nor if the sound of a Va _n_ a, of a large or a small drum, the noise of a\nchariot, and the wail of a person in pain (are heard), 7\n\n8\\. Nor if the barking of many dogs and jackals, or the braying of many\ndonkeys (is heard),\n\n9\\. Nor if (the sky appears flaming) red, a rainbow (is seen), or hoar-frost\n(lies on the ground), 9\n\n10\\. Nor if clouds rise out of season. 10\n\n11\\. (Let him not study) when he feels the necessity to void urine or\nexcrements, 11\n\n12\\. Nor at midnight, in the twilight, and (while standing) in the water, 12\n\n13\\. Nor while rain falls. 13\n\np. 261\n\n14\\. Some (declare, that the recitation of the Veda must be interrupted only)\nwhen (the rain) is dripping from the edge of the roof.\n\n15\\. (Nor shall he study) when the teachers (of the gods and \xc3\x82suras, i.e. the\nplanets Jupiter and Venus) are surrounded by a halo, 15\n\n16\\. Nor (when this happens) to the two (great) lights (the sun and the moon),\n16\n\n17\\. (Nor) while he is in fear, riding in a carriage or on beasts of burden,\nor lying down, nor while his feet are raised, 17\n\n18\\. (Nor) in a burial-ground, at the extremity of a village, on a high-road,\nnor during impurity, 18\n\n19\\. Nor while a foul smell (is perceptible), while a corpse or a Ka _n_ _d_\nala (is) in (the village), nor in the neighbourhood of a _S_ udra, 19\n\n20\\. Nor while (he suffers from) sour eructations. 20\n\n21\\. The _Ri_ _g_ -veda and the Ya _g_ ur-veda (shall not be studied) while\nthe sound of the Samans (is heard). 21\n\n22\\. The fall of a thunderbolt, an earthquake, an eclipse, and (the fall of)\nmeteors (are reasons for discontinuing the reading of the Veda) until the same\ntime (next day), 22\n\n23\\. Likewise when it thunders and rains and 23\n\np. 262\n\nwhen lightning (flashes out of season) after the fires have become visible (in\nthe twilight).\n\n24\\. (If these phenomena appear) during the (rainy) season, (the reading must\nbe interrupted) for a day (or a night), 24\n\n25\\. And if lightning (is observed) during the night, (the recitation of the\nVeda shall be interrupted) until the third watch. 25\n\n26\\. If (lightning) flashes during the third part of the day or later, (the\nVeda must not be read) during the entire (following night).\n\n27\\. (According to the opinion) of some, a fiery meteor (has the same effect)\nas lightning,\n\n28\\. Likewise thunder (which is heard) during the last part of the day,\n\n29\\. (Or) also in the twilight.\n\np. 263\n\n30\\. (If thunder is heard) before midnight, (the study of the Veda must be\ninterrupted) during the whole night. 30\n\n31\\. (If it is heard) during the (early part of the) day, (the interruption\nmust continue) as long as the sun shines,\n\n32\\. Likewise if the king of the country has died.\n\n33\\. If one (pupil) has gone on a journey (and) another (stays) with (the\nteacher, the study of the Veda shall be interrupted until the absentee\nreturns). 33\n\n34\\. When an attack (is made on the village), or a fire (breaks out), when one\nVeda has been completed, after (an attack of) vomiting, when he has partaken\nof a funeral repast or of a dinner on the occasion of a sacrifice offered to\nmen, (the study of the Veda shall be interrupted) for a day and a night, 34\n\n35\\. Likewise on the day of the new moon.\n\n36\\. (On the latter occasion it may also be interrupted) for two days. 36\n\n37\\. (The Veda shall not be studied for a day and a night) on the full moon\ndays of the months Karttika, Phalgu _n_ a, and \xc3\x82sha _dh_ a. 37\n\np. 264\n\n38\\. On the three Ash _t_ akas (the Veda shall not be studied) for three (days\nand) nights. 38\n\n39\\. Some (declare, that the rule applies) to the last Ash _t_ aka (only).\n\n40\\. (On the occasion of) the annual (Upakarman and Utsarga the reading shall\nbe interrupted) on the day (of the ceremony) and those preceding and following\nit. 40\n\n41\\. All (teachers declare, that the reading shall be interrupted for three\ndays) when rain, thunder, and lightning (are observed) simultaneously, 41\n\n42\\. When the rain is very heavy, (the reading shall be interrupted as long as\nit lasts). 42\n\n43\\. On a festive day (the reading shall be stopped) after the (morning) meal,\n43\n\n44\\. And he who has begun to study (after the Upakarman shall not read) at\nnight for four Muhurtas. 44\n\n45\\. Some (declare, that the recitation of the Veda is) always (forbidden) in\na town. 45\n\n46\\. While he is impure (he shall) not even (recite the Veda) mentally. 46\n\np. 265\n\n47\\. (The study) of those who offer a funeral sacrifice (must be interrupted)\nuntil the same time next day, 47\n\n48\\. Even if uncooked grain is offered at the funeral sacrifice.\n\n49\\. And (those rules regarding the stoppage of the reading must be observed),\nwhich they teach in the several schools. 49\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[259:1](sbe0280.htm#fr_1259) **XVI**. \xc3\x82pastamba I, 3, 9, 1.

The above translation\nfollows the reading of my MSS., which differ very much from Professor\nStenzler\'s edition. According to them the commentary on the latter part of\nSutra 23 and on Sutra 24 runs as follows: . . . pratyekam alalika\nanadhyayahetava _h_ | apartav idam | _ri_ tav aha ||\n\nAHA _RI_ TAU || 24 ||\n\nVarshartav ete yadi bhaveyu _h_ sandhyaya _m_ tadaharmatram anadhyaya _h_ |\nprata _s_ _k_ et | saya _m_ tu ratrav anadhyaya ityarthasiddhatvad anuktam ||\n. . . \'are each reasons for discontinuing the recitation until the same time\nnext day. This (rule) refers to other times than the rainy season. He now\ndeclares (the rule) for the rainy season:\n\n24\\. "During the (rainy) season for a day."\n\n\'If these (phenomena) happen in the twilight during the rainy season, the\ninterruption of the study lasts for that day only, provided (they happen) in\nthe morning. But if they happen in the evening, study is forbidden during the\nnight. As this is clear from the context, it has not been declared specially.\'\n--Haradatta. I suspect that Professor Stenzler\'s reading apartau is a\ncorrection, made by an ingenious Pandit, of an old varia lectio \'ahartau\' for\naha _ri_ tau, which is found in one of my MSS. (C) also.\n\n[262:25](sbe0280.htm#fr_1279) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 3, 9, 21.\n\n[263:30](sbe0280.htm#fr_1280) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 3, 9, 23.\n\n[263:33](sbe0280.htm#fr_1281) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 3, 11, 11. Haradatta adds that\nothers enjoin a stoppage of the Veda-study from the hour of the departure\nuntil the same hour on the following day, while another commentator gives the\nfollowing explanation: \'All, indeed, the teacher and the rest, shall, on that\nday, not even recite the Veda in order to remember it.\'\n\n[263:34](sbe0280.htm#fr_1282) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 3, 9, 25; I, 3, 10, 22, 28-30; I,\n3, 11, 6, 30; Manu IV, 118. Haradatta is in doubt whether \'a sacrifice offered\nin honour of men\' means a Sa _m_ skara, or a sacrifice to gods, like Kumara,\nwho formerly were men; see \xc3\x82pastamba I, 3, 11, 3.\n\n[263:36](sbe0280.htm#fr_1283) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 3, 9, 28.\n\n[263:37](sbe0280.htm#fr_1284) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 3, 10, 1.\n\n[264:38](sbe0280.htm#fr_1285) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 3, 10, 2. Regarding the meaning of\nthe word Ash _t_ aka, see above, VIII, 18 note.\n\n[264:40](sbe0280.htm#fr_1286) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 3, 10, 2.\n\n[264:41](sbe0280.htm#fr_1287) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 3, 11, 27.\n\n[264:42](sbe0280.htm#fr_1288) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 3, 11, 28.\n\n[264:43](sbe0280.htm#fr_1289) Haradatta explains \'a festive day\' to mean the\nday of the initiation and the like, but see \xc3\x82pastamba I, 3, 11, 20.\n\n[264:44](sbe0280.htm#fr_1290) Haradatta explains this Sutra as equivalent to\n\xc3\x82pastamba I, 3, 9, 1. He adds that another commentator reads pradhitasya _k_ a\nas a separate Sutra, interpreting it to mean, \'And a person who has performed\nthe Upakarman (shall not study after dinner),\' and refers the words \'at night\nfor four Muhurtas\' to the prohibition to read on the evening of the thirteenth\nday of the dark half of the month.\n\n[264:45](sbe0280.htm#fr_1291) Manu IV, 116.\n\n[264:46](sbe0280.htm#fr_1292) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 3, 11, 25.\n\n[265:47](sbe0280.htm#fr_1293) \xc3\x82pastamba, ibidem.\n\n[265:49](sbe0280.htm#fr_1294) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 3, 11, 38.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XVII](sbe0281.htm)\n\n'
