Near the bed (a Bali must be offered) with (a Mantra) addressed to Kama\n(Cupid).\n\n2\\. On the door-sill (a Bali must be placed) with (a Mantra) addressed to\nAntariksha (the air). 2\n\n3\\. With (the Mantra) that follows (in the Upanishad, he offers a Bali) near\nthe door. 3\n\np. 108\n\n4\\. With the following (ten Mantras, addressed to Earth, Air, Heaven, Sun,\nMoon, the Constellations, Indra, B _ri_ haspati, Pra _g_ apati, and Brahman,\nhe offers ten Balis, each following one to the east of the preceding one), in\n(the part of the house called) the seat of Brahma. 4\n\n5\\. He shall offer to the south (of the Balis offered before, a Bali) with a\nMantra addressed to the Manes; his sacrificial cord shall be suspended over\nthe right shoulder, and the (palm of his right hand shall be turned upwards\nand) inclined to the right. 5\n\n6\\. To the north (of the Bali given to the Manes, a Bali shall be offered) to\nRudra, in the same manner as to the (other) gods. 6\n\n7\\. The sprinkling with water (which precedes and follows the oblation) of\nthese two (Balis, takes place) separately, on account of the difference of the\nrule (for each case). 7\n\np. 109\n\n8\\. At night only he shall offer (the Bali to the Goblins), throwing it in he\nair and reciting the last (Mantra). 8\n\n9\\. He who devoutly offers those (above-described), to the rules, (obtains)\nBalis and Homas), according eternal bliss in heaven and prosperity.\n\n10\\. And (after the Balis have been performed, a portion of the food) must\nfirst be given as alms. 10\n\n11\\. He shall give food to his guests first, 11\n\n12\\. And to infants, old or sick people, female (relations, and) pregnant\nwomen. 12\n\n13\\. The master (of the house) and his wife shall not refuse a man who asks\nfor food at the time (when the Vai _s_ vadeva offering has been performed).\n\n14\\. If there is no food, earth, water, grass, and a kind word, indeed, never\nfall in the house of a good man. Thus (say those who know the law). 14\n\np. 110\n\n15\\. Endless worlds are the portion (of those householders and wives) who act\nthus.\n\n16\\. To a Brahma _n_ a who has not studied the Veda, a seat, water, and food\nmust be given. But (the giver) shall not rise (to do him honour). 16\n\n17\\. But if (such a man) is worthy of a salutation (for other reasons), he\nshall rise to salute him.\n\n18\\. Nor (shall a Brahma _n_ a rise to receive) a Kshatriya or Vai _s_ ya\n(though they may be learned). 18\n\n19\\. If a _S_ udra comes as a guest (to a Brahma _n_ a), he shall give him\nsome work to do. He may feed him, after (that has been performed). 19\n\n20\\. Or the slaves (of the Brahma _n_ a householder) shall fetch (rice) from\nthe royal stores, and honour the _S_ udra as a guest. 20\n\n21\\. (A householder) must always wear his garment over (his left shoulder and\nunder his right arm).\n\n22\\. Or he may use a cord only, slung over his left shoulder and passed under\nhis right arm, instead of the garment.\n\n23\\. He shall sweep together (the crumbs) on the place where he has eaten, and\ntake them away. He shall sprinkle water on that place, turning the palm\ndownwards, and remove the stains (of food from the cooking-vessels with a\nstick), wash them with water, and take their contents to a clean place to the\nnorth (of the house, offering them) to Rudra. In this manner his house will\nbecome prosperous.\n\np. 111\n\n24\\. It is declared in the Sm _ri_ tis that a Brahma _n_ a alone should be\nchosen as teacher (or spiritual guide). 24\n\n25\\. In times of distress a Brahma _n_ a may study under a Kshatriya or Vai\n_s_ ya.\n\n26\\. And (during his pupilship) he must walk behind (such a teacher).\n\n27\\. Afterwards the Brahma _n_ a shall take precedence before (his Kshatriya\nor Vai _s_ ya teacher).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[107:2](sbe0239.htm#fr_557) **4**. \'Others explain dehali\', "the door-sill,"\nto mean "the door-case."\'--Haradatta.\n\n[107:3](sbe0239.htm#fr_558) \'Others explain apidhana, "the panels of the\ndoor;" to mean "the bolt of the door."\'--Haradatta. The offering is made to\nNama, \'the name, or essence of things.\'\n\n[108:4](sbe0239.htm#fr_559) Haradatta gives two explanations of the word\nBrahmasadana, \'the seat of Brahman.\' According to some, it is an architectural\nterm, designating the centre of the house; according to others, it denotes the\nplace where, at the time of the burnt-oblations, the Brahman or superintending\npriest is seated, i.e. a spot to the south of the sacred fire.\n\n[108:5](sbe0239.htm#fr_560) Balis and water for the Manes are placed or poured\ninto the palm of the hand and thrown out between the thumb and forefinger.\nThat part of the palm is, therefore, sometimes called \'the tirtha sacred to\nthe Manes.\' See Manu II, 39.\n\n[108:6](sbe0239.htm#fr_561) \'That is to say, the sacrificial cord shall not be\nsuspended over the right shoulder, nor shall the Bali be thrown out between\nthe thumb and forefinger.\'--Haradatta\n\n[108:7](sbe0239.htm#fr_562) In sprinkling around an offering to the gods, the\nsacrificer turns his right hand towards the oblation and pours out the water,\nbeginning in the south and ending in the east. In sprinkling around an\noffering to the Manes, exactly the opposite order is to be followed.\n\n[109:8](sbe0239.htm#fr_563) At night, i. e. before the evening meal. The\nMantra is, \'To those beings which, being servants of Vituda, roam about day\nand night, desiring a Bali-offering, I offer this Bali, desirous of\nprosperity. May the Lord of prosperity grant me prosperity, svaha. Haradatta\nadds, that according to another commentator, no other Bali but this is to be\noffered in the evening, and that some modify the Mantra for each occasion,\noffering the Bali in the morning to the Bhutas that roam about during the\nday,\' and in the evening \'to the night-walkers.\' Compare for the whole section\nManu III, 90-92; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 102-104.\n\n[109:10](sbe0239.htm#fr_564) Manu III, 94 seq.\n\n[109:11](sbe0239.htm#fr_565) Manu III, 115; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 105.\n\n[109:12](sbe0239.htm#fr_566) Manu III, 114; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 105.\n\n[109:14](sbe0239.htm#fr_567) Manu III, 101 Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 107. As read in the\ntext, the first line of the verse has one syllable in excess. This\nirregularity would disappear if t _ri_ _n_ a, the Vedic form of the nom. ace.\nplural, were read for t _ri_ _n_ ani, and it seems to me not improbable that t\n_ri_ _n_ ani is a correction made by a Pandit who valued grammatical\ncorrectness higher than correctness of metre.\n\n[110:16](sbe0239.htm#fr_568) Manu III, 99.\n\n[110:18](sbe0239.htm#fr_569) Manu III, 110-112; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 107.\n\n[110:19](sbe0239.htm#fr_570) Manu loc. cit.\n\n[110:20](sbe0239.htm#fr_571) \'Hence it is known that the king ought to keep\nstores of rice and the like in every village, in order to show hospitality to\n_S_ udra guests.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[111:24](sbe0239.htm#fr_572) Manu II, 241, 242. From here down to II, 3, 6, 2,\n\xc3\x82pastamba again treats of the duties of students and teachers, a subject which\nappears to have in his eyes a greater importance than any other. The rules\ngiven now apply chiefly to householders. It would seem that they have been\ninserted in this particular place, because the reception of a former teacher\nis to be described II, 3, 5, 4-11, and that of a \'learned guest\' II, 3, 6, 3\nseq.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na II, Pa _t_ ala 2, Kha _n_ _d_ a 5](sbe0240.htm)\n\n'
