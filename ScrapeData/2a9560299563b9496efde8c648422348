Now (follows) the sacrifice to Sita.\n\n2\\. Wherever he sacrifices, be it (on a field) of rice or of barley, of that\ngrain he should prepare a mess of cooked food.\n\n3 3. One who has sacrificed may, if he likes, prepare elsewhere also a mess of\ncooked food, either of rice or of barley.\n\n4 4. (There should be) no doubt (as to whether rice or barley is to be taken),\nas a rule thereon has been stated above.\n\n5\\. If it is impossible (to take one of the two species of corn), (that) is\nexcluded.\n\n6\\. To the east or to the north of the field, on a\n\np. 334\n\nclean spot that has been ploughed, so that the crop he not damaged,\n\n7\\. Or in the village, because (there) both (rice and barley) are united, and\nbecause no obstacle is there.\n\n8\\. Where he intends to cook (the sacrificial food), he establishes the fire\non a place that has been smeared (with cowdung), which is elevated, and which\nhas been sprinkled (with water), strews (round the fire) Darbha grass mixed\nwith (stalks of) that (sort of corn to which the sacrifice refers), sacrifices\nthe two \xc3\x82 _g_ ya portions and \xc3\x82 _g_ ya oblations (with the following Mantras):\n\n9\\. 'For whom earth and heaven, the intermediate points and the chief points\n(of the horizon) are veiled with light, that Indra I invoke here. May his\nweapons be friendly towards us. Svaha!\n\n'Whatsoever it be that I wish for at this sacrifice, O killer of V _ri_ tra,\nmay all that be fulfilled to me, and may I live a hundred autumns. Svaha!\n\n'May success, prosperity, earth, rain, eminence, excellence, luck here protect\nthe creatures. Svaha!\n\n'In whose substance dwells the prosperity of all Vedic and worldly works,\nIndra's wife Sita I invoke. May she not abandon me in whatever work I do.\nSvaha!\n\nHer, who rich in horses, rich in cows, rich in delight indefatigably supports\nliving beings, Urvara (i.e. the field) who is wreathed with threshing-floors,\nI invoke at this sacrifice, the firm One. May she not abandon me. Svaha!\n\n10\\. He makes oblations of the cooked sacrificial food to Sita, Ya _g_ a (the\ngoddess of sacrifice), _S_ ama (the goddess of zealous devotion), Bhuti (the\ngoddess of welfare).\n\np. 335\n\n11\\. Some say that the giving (of the sacrificial food to the deities)\naccompanies the Mantras.\n\n12 12. But this is excluded, as the _S_ ruti says, 'The giving (of the\noblation to the deity) accompanies the word Svaha.'\n\n13\\. On the Ku _s_ a grass which is left over from the strewing (of grass\nround the fire), he offers a Bali to the protecting demons of the furrow with\n(the Mantra), 'They who are sitting towards the east with strong bows and\nquivers, may they protect thee from the east, and be vigilant and not abandon\nthee. To them I bring adoration, and I offer this Bali to them.'\n\n14 14. Then to the south with (the Mantra), 'They who are sitting towards the\nsouth, not winking the eyes, wearing armour, may they protect thee from the\nsouth, and be vigilant and not abandon thee. To them I bring adoration, and I\noffer this Bali to them.'\n\n15 15. Then to the west with (the Mantra), 'The powerful ones, the excellent\nones, prosperity, earth, Parsh _n_ i, _S_ una _m_ kuri, may they protect thee\nfrom the west, and be vigilant and not abandon thee. To them I bring\nadoration, and I offer this Bali to them.'\n\n16\\. Then to the north with (the Mantra), 'The fearful ones, like to Vayu in\nspeed, may they protect\n\np. 336\n\nthee from the north, on the field, on the threshing-floor, in the house, on\nthe way, and be vigilant and not abandon thee. To them I bring adoration, and\nI offer this Bali to them.'\n\n17 17. Of another (sort of food) as the chief (food used at this sacrifice),\nand with the remainder of \xc3\x82 _g_ ya, he distributes Balis as above.\n\n18\\. And the women should make accompanying oblations, because such is the\ncustom.\n\n19\\. When the ceremony is finished, he should feed the Brahma _n_ as. He\nshould feed the Brahma _n_ as.\n\nEnd of the Second Ka _n_ _d_ a.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[333:1](sbe29190.htm#fr_859) 17, 1. The goddess Sita is, as her name\nindicates, the rustic deity of the furrow.\n\n[333:3](sbe29190.htm#fr_860) Perhaps the meaning is that a person who has\nalready once performed the Sita-ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a on the field, is allowed, when\nrepeating the sacrifice another time, to celebrate it elsewhere, and to choose\nat his will between rice and barley.\n\n[333:4](sbe29190.htm#fr_861) A rule has been given in the _S_ rauta-sutra\n(Katy. I, 9, 1: 'Rice or barley, if a Havis [is prescribed]') which shows that\nit is indifferent whether rice or barley is taken. Thus the sacrificer is free\nto elect the one or the other. At least this is the traditional meaning of\nthis Sutra. But possibly we had better understand it otherwise. The sacrificer\nshould offer, according to Sutra 3, rice or barley. Whether he has to take the\none or the other, there can be no doubt, as the rule given above (Sutra 2)\nshows that rice should be cooked, if the ceremony is performed for a rice-\nfield, and barley, if for a barley-field.\n\n[335:12](sbe29190.htm#fr_862) The quotation has not been as yet identified in\nthe _S_ ruti itself, but the words quoted are found in Katy.- _S_ raut. I, 2,\n7.\n\n[335:14](sbe29190.htm#fr_863) Some words in the beginning of the Mantra are\nlost. We should probably write: atha dakshi _n_ ata _h_. ye dakshi _n_\nato\xe0\xa4\xbdnimisha _h_ . . . varmi _n_ a asate, &c. Of course it is impossible to say\nwhich is the word that is wanting before (or perhaps after) varmi _n_ a _h_.\n\n[335:15](sbe29190.htm#fr_864) Parsh _n_ i, which means 'heel,' stands here, of\ncourse, as the name of a protecting demon.\n\n[336:17](sbe29190.htm#fr_865) See above, chap. 13, 2.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 1](sbe29191.htm)\n\n"
