There is separation (of the Self from the\n\np. 270\n\nbody) because its existence does not depend on the existence of that (viz. the\nbody), but there is not (non-separation); as in the case of perceptive\nconsciousness.\n\nThe assertion that the Self is not separate from the body cannot be\nmaintained. The Self rather must be something separate from the body, 'because\nthe existence (of the Self) does not depend on the existence of that (i.e. the\nbody).' For if from the circumstance that they are where the body is you\nconclude that the qualities of the Self are qualities of the body, you also\nmust conclude from the fact that they are not where the body is that they are\nnot qualities of the body, because thereby they show themselves to be\ndifferent in character from the qualities of the body. Now the (real)\nqualities of the body, such as form and so on, may be viewed as existing as\nlong as the body exists; life, movement, &c., on the other hand, do not exist\neven when the body exists, viz. in the state of death. The qualities of the\nbody, again, such as form and so on, are perceived by others; not so the\nqualities of the Self, such as consciousness, remembrance, and so on.\nMoreover, we can indeed ascertain the presence of those latter qualities as\nlong as the body exists in the state of life, but we cannot ascertain their\nnon-existence when the body does not exist; for it is possible that even after\nthis body has died the qualities of the Self should continue to exist by\npassing over into another body. The opposite opinion is thus precluded also\nfor the reason of its being a mere hypothesis.--We further must question our\nopponent as to the nature of that consciousness which he assumes to spring\nfrom the elements; for the materialists do not admit the existence of anything\nbut the four elements. Should he say that consciousness is the perception of\nthe elements and what springs from the elements, we remark that in that case\nthe elements and their products are objects of consciousness and that hence\nthe latter cannot be a quality of them, as it is contradictory that anything\nshould act on itself. Fire is hot indeed but does not burn itself, and the\nacrobat, well\n\np. 271\n\ntrained as he may be, cannot mount on his own shoulders. As little could\nconsciousness, if it were a mere quality of the elements and their products,\nrender them objects of itself. For form and other (undoubted) qualities do not\nmake their own colour or the colour of something else their objects; the\nelements and their products, on the other hand, whether external or belonging\nto the Self (the organism) are rendered objects by consciousness. Hence in the\nsame way as we admit the existence of that perceptive consciousness which has\nthe material elements and their products for its objects, we also must admit\nthe separateness of that consciousness from the elements. And as consciousness\nconstitutes the character of our Self, the Self must be distinct from the\nbody. That consciousness is permanent, follows from the uniformity of its\ncharacter (and we therefore may conclude that the conscious Self is permanent\nalso; as also follows) from the fact that the Self, although connected with a\ndifferent state, recognises itself as the conscious agent--a recognition\nexpressed in judgments such as 'I saw this,'--and from the fact of remembrance\nand so on being possible 1.\n\nThe argumentation that consciousness is an attribute of the body because it is\nwhere a body is, is already refuted by the reasons stated above. Moreover,\nperceptive consciousness takes place where there are certain auxiliaries such\nas lamps and the like, and does not take place where those are absent, without\nits following therefrom that perception is an attribute of the lamp or the\nlike. Analogously\n\np. 272\n\nthe fact that perception takes place where there is a body, and does not take\nplace where there is none, does not imply that it is an attribute of the body;\nfor like lamps and so on the body may be used (by the Self) as a mere\nauxiliary. Nor is it even true that the body is absolutely required as an\nauxiliary of perception; for in the state of dream we have manifold\nperceptions while the body lies motionless.--The view of the Self being\nsomething separate from the body is therefore free from all objections.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[271:1](sbe38197.htm#fr_169) The 'nityatva _m_ _k_ a' of the text might\nperhaps be connected directly with 'atmano.' \xc3\x82nanda Giri on the entire\npassage: Bhavatu tarhi bhutebhyo\xe0\xa4\xbdtirikta svatantryopalabdhis tathapi katham\natmasiddhis tatraha upalabdhiti, ksha _n_ ikatvat tasya nityatmarupatvam\nayuktam ity a _s_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kya _g_ anatas tadbhedabhavad vishayoparagat tadbhanad\nasav eva nityopalabdhir ity aha nityatva _m_ _k_ eti, ki _m_ _k_ a\nsthuladehabhimanahinasya svapne pratyabhi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anad atiriktatmasiddhir ity\naha aham iti, svapne sthuladehantarasyaivopalabdh _ri_ tvam ity a _s_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kyaha\nsm _ri_ tyaditi, upalabdh _ri_ smartror bhede saty anyopalabdhe\xe0\xa4\xbdnyasya sm _ri_\ntir i _k_ _kh_ adaya _s_ _k_ a neti na tayor anyatety artha _h_.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 55](sbe38198.htm)\n\n"
