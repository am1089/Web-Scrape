We read in the Prabuddha Bharata, May, 1898, p. 132 seq., of one\nRai Shaligram Saheb Bahadur. Saheb Bahadur, who is now about seventy years of\nage, has spent a very active and useful life as an official in the Post\nOffice, where he rose to be Postmaster-General of the North-Western Provinces.\nIt seems that the horrors of the mutiny in 1857 made a deep impression on his\nmind.\n\np. 21\n\n[paragraph continues] He saw thousands of men, women, and children butchered\nbefore his eyes, the rich reduced to poverty, the poor raised to unexpected\nand undeserved wealth, so that the idea of the world's impermanent and\ntransient nature took complete possession of him and estranged him from all\nthat had formerly enlisted his interest and occupied his energies. From his\nvery youth, however, his mind had been filled with religious and philosophical\nquestions, and he is said to have devoted much time from his youth onward\nthrough all the years of his official life to the study of the Sacred\nScriptures. No wonder therefore that after witnessing the horrors of the\nmutiny and its suppression, he should have wished to flee from this den of\nmisery and to get happiness unalloyed and permanent where alone it could be\nfound. He went to consult several Sa _m_ nyasins and Yogins, but they could\nnot help him. At last one of his colleagues at the Post Office recommended his\nelder brother as a spiritual guide who could be trusted. For two years he\nattended his lectures, compared his teaching with that of the Upanishads and\nother holy writings, and then became his devoted pupil or Chela. During his\nstay at Agra he allowed no one else to serve his master. He used to grind the\nflour for him, to cook his meals, and feed him with his own hands. Every\nmorning he could be seen carrying a pitcher of pure water on his head for the\nGuru to bathe in, which he fetched from a place two miles distant. His monthly\nsalary also was handed over to the Saint, who used it for the support of his\npupils, wife and children, and spent the rest in charity. All his home affairs\nwere superintended by his Guru, and\n\np. 22\n\nthis was done in spite of the opposition of his castemen who were Kayasthas,\nand did not approve of one of their caste cooking the Saint's food and eating\nfrom his dishes, because the Saint was a member of another caste, that of the\nKhetris. After some time the pupil wished to retire from the postal service,\nbut the Saint would not allow it. When he was appointed Postmaster-General of\nthe North-West he fell on his knees before the Saint and begged his permission\nto retire and enter soul and body into the true spiritual life, but the Saint\nonce more refused, saying that the discharge of his official duties would in\nno way interfere with his spiritual progress. Accordingly he left Agra, and\nfor many years held his new post at Allahabad, as it is said, with great\nsuccess, having introduced many reforms and useful changes in the Postal\nDepartment.\n\nIt was not till the death of his Guru in 1897 that the Postmaster-General felt\nhimself free and justified in leaving the service. He then became a Guru\nhimself, and imparted spiritual instruction to those who came to seek for his\nhelp. Often those who came to listen to him were so inspired by his teaching\nthat they renounced the world and began to lead the life of Sa _m_ nyasins, so\nthat it became a general belief that whoever went to Rai Shaligram would\nforsake his family and become an ascetic. Nay, it was said that no one could\neven look at the lamp burning on the upper story of his house without being\ninfluenced to renounce the world, to forsake his relations, and thus to become\nuseless to the community at large. When last heard of the old man was still\nalive, his house besieged every\n\np. 23\n\nday by large numbers of persons, both male and female, who flock there from\ndifferent parts of the country. He holds five meetings day and night for the\npurpose of imparting religious instruction, so that he has hardly more than\ntwo hours left for sleep. Everybody is welcome, and no distinction is made\nbetween Brahman and ! _S_ udra, rich and poor, good and bad. The people are\nconvinced that he can work miracles, but he himself regards such things as\nunbecoming, and below his dignity. It is said that the late Doctor Makund Lai,\nAssistant-Surgeon to the Viceroy, was in the habit of sending to him patients\nwho had made themselves senseless by excessive practice of Pra _n_ ayama,\nrestraint of the breath, and that by a mere look he brought them back to their\nsenses, and taught them that this practice was of little good, and in many\ncases injurious.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a](rls12.htm)\n\n"
