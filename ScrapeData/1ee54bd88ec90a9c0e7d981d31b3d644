THE night of Brahman being over, and the God sprung from the lotus\n(Brahman) having woke from his slumber, Vish _n_ u purposing to create living\nbeings, and perceiving the earth covered with water,\n\n2\\. Assumed the shape of a boar, delighting to sport in water, as at the\nbeginning of each former Kalpa, and raised up the earth (from the water).\n\n3\\. His feet were the Vedas; his tusks the sacrificial stakes; in his teeth\nwere the offerings; his mouth was the pyre; his tongue was the fire; his hair\nwas the sacrificial grass; the sacred texts were his head; and he was (endowed\nwith the miraculous power of) a great ascetic.\n\n4\\. His eyes were day and night; he was of superhuman nature; his ears were\nthe two bundles of Ku _s_ a grass (for the Ish _t_ is, or smaller sacrifices,\nand for the animal offerings); his ear-rings were the ends of those bundles of\nKu _s_ a grass (used for wiping\n\n[I. 1. Regarding the duration of a night of Brahman, see XX, 14. \'Bhutani\'\nmeans living beings of all the four kinds, born from the womb and the rest.\n(Nand.) The three other kinds consist of those produced from an egg, from\nsweat, and from a shoot or germ; see Manu I, 43-46.\n\n2\\. A Kalpa = a day of Brahman; see XX, 13.]\n\np. 2\n\nthe ladle and other sacrificial implements); his nose (the vessel containing)\nthe clarified butter; his snout was the ladle of oblations; his voice was\nsimilar in sound to the chanting of the Sama-veda; and he was of huge size.\n\n5\\. He was full of piety and veracity; beautiful; his strides and his strength\nwere immense (like those of Vish _n_ u); his large nostrils were penances; his\nknees the victim; and his figure colossal.\n\n6\\. His entrails were the (three) chanters of the Sama-veda[1]; his member was\nthe burnt-oblation; his scrotum was the sacrificial seeds and grains; his mind\nwas the altar (in the hut for the wives and domestic uses of the sacrificer);\nthe hindparts (of Vish _n_ u) in his transformation were the Mantras; his\nblood was the Soma juice.\n\n7\\. His shoulders were the (great) altar; his smell was that of the\n(sacrificial cake and other) oblations; his speed was the oblations to the\ngods and to the manes and other oblations; his body was the hut for the wives\nand domestic uses of the sacrificer; he was majestic; and instructed with the\ninitiatory ceremonies for manifold sacrifices (lasting one, or two, three, or\ntwelve years, and others).\n\n8\\. His heart was the sacrificial fee; he was possessed of the (sacrificial\nand other) great Mantras employed in order to effect the union of the mind\nwith the Supreme; he was of enormous size (like the long sacrifices lasting\nmore than one day); his lovely, lips were the beginnings of the two\n\n[6. 1. This is because the vital breaths, by which the sound of the voice is\neffected, pass through them, it having been said (in 4) that the sound of his\nvoice was like the chanting of the Sama-veda.\' (Nand.)]\n\np. 3\n\nhymns recited at the beginning of the animal sacrifice; his ornaments were the\nwhirlpool of the milk poured into the heated vessel (at the Pravargya ceremony\nintroductory to the Soma-sacrifice).\n\n9\\. All sorts of sacred texts (the Gayatri and others) were his path in\nmarching; the mysterious Upanishads (the Vedanta) were his couch; he was\naccompanied by his consort _Kh_ aya (Lakshmi); he was in size like the Ma _n_\nis _ri_ nga mountain.\n\n10\\. The lord, the creator, the great Yogin, plunging into the one ocean from\nlove of the world,\n\n11\\. Raised up, with the edge of his tusks, the earth bounded by the sea\ntogether with its mountains, forests, and groves, which was immersed in the\nwater of (the seven oceans now become) one ocean, and created the universe\nanew.\n\n12\\. Thus the whole earth, after having sunk into (the lower region called)\nRasatala, was in the first place raised in the boar-incarnation by Vish _n_ u,\nwho took compassion upon the living beings.\n\n13, 14. Then, after having raised the earth, the destroyer of Madhu placed and\nfixed it upon its own (former) seat (upon the oceans) and distributed the\nwaters upon it according to their own (former) station, conducting the floods\nof the oceans into the oceans, the water of the rivers into the rivers, the\nwater of the tanks into the tanks, and the water of the lakes into the lakes.\n\n15\\. He created the seven (lower regions called) Patalas[1] and the seven\nworlds, the seven Dvipas\n\n[15. 1 The seven Patalas are, Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Mahatala, Rasatala,\nTalatala, and Patala; the seven worlds are, Bhur-loka, Bhuvar-loka, Svar-loka,\nMahar-loka, _G_ anar-loka, Tapar-loka, and Satya-loka; the seven Dvipas or\ndivisions of the terrestrial world, are, _G_ ambu, Plaksha, _S_ almali, Ku _s_\na, Krau\xc3\xb1 _k_ a, _S_ aka, and Pushkara; each Dvipa is encircled by one of the\nseven oceans, viz. the seas of Lava _n_ a (salt-water), Ikshu (syrup), Sarpi\n_h_ (butter), Dadhi (sour milk), Dugdha (milk), Svadhu (treacle), and Udaka\n(water), (Nand.) The enumerations contained in the Vish _n_ u-pura _n_ a and\nother works differ on two or three points only from that given by Nand.--\n\n2 Besides the interpretation followed in the text, Nand. proposes a second\nexplanation of the term \'sthanani,\' as denoting Bharatavarsha (India) and the\nother eight plains situated between the principal mountains.]\n\np. 4\n\nand the seven oceans, and fixed their several limits[2].\n\n16\\. (He created) the rulers of the (seven) Dvipas and the (eight) guardians\nof the world (Indra and the rest), the rivers, mountains, and trees, the seven\nRishis, who know (and practise) the law, the Vedas together with their A _n_\ngas, the Suras, and the Asuras.\n\n17\\. (He created) Pisa _k_ as (ogres), Uragas (serpents), Gandharvas\n(celestial singers), Yakshas (keepers of Kubera\'s treasures), Rakshasas\n(goblins), and men, cattle, birds, deer and other animals, (in short) all the\nfour kinds of living beings[1], and clouds, rainbows, lightnings, and other\ncelestial phenomena or bodies (such as the planets and the asterisms), and all\nkinds of sacrifices.\n\n18\\. Bhagavat, after having thus created, in the\n\n[16. The eight \'guardians of the world\' (Lokapalas) are, Indra, Agni, Yama,\nSurya, Varu _n_ a, Pavana, Kubera, and Soma (M.V, 96). The seven _Ri_ shis,\naccording to the Satapatha-brahma _n_ a, are, Gotama, Bharadva _g_ a, Vi _s_\nvamitra, _G_ amadagni, Vasish _th_ a, Ka _s_ yapa, and Atri. The six Veda _n_\ngas are, _S_ iksha (pronunciation), _Kh_ andas (metre), Vyakara _n_ a\n(grammar), Nirukta (etymology), Kalpa (ceremonial), and _G_ yotisha\n(astronomy). See Max Muller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 108, &c.\n\n17\\. 1 See I.]\n\np. 5\n\nshape of a boar, this world together with all animate and inanimate things in\nit, went away into a place hidden from the world.\n\n19\\. _G_ anardana, the chief of the gods, having become invisible, the goddess\nof the earth began to consider, \'How shall I be able to sustain myself\n(henceforth)?\'\n\n20\\. \'I will go to Kasyapa to ask: he will tell me the truth. The great Muni\nhas my welfare under constant consideration.\'\n\n21\\. Having thus decided upon her course, the goddess, assuming the shape of a\nwoman, went to see Ka _s_ yapa, and Ka _s_ yapa saw her.\n\n22\\. Her eyes were similar, to the leaves of the blue lotus (of which the bow\nof Kama, the god of love, is made); her face was radiant like the moon in the\nautumn season; her locks were as dark as a swarm of black bees; she was\nradiant; her lip was (red) like the Bandhu _g_ iva flower; and she was lovely\nto behold.\n\n23\\. Her eyebrows were fine; her teeth exceedingly small; her nose handsome;\nher brows bent; her neck shaped like a shell; her thighs were constantly\ntouching each other; and they were fleshy thighs, which adorned her loins.\n\n24\\. Her breasts were shining white, firm[1], plump, very close to each other,\n(decorated with continuous strings of pearls) like the projections on the\nforehead of Indra\'s elephant, and radiant like the gold (of the two golden\njars used at the consecration of a king).\n\n[24 1 Or \'equal in size,\' according to the second of the two explanations\nwhich Nand. proposes of the term \'samau.\']\n\np. 6\n\n25\\. Her arms were as delicate as lotus fibres; her hands were similar to\nyoung shoots; her thighs were resplendent like golden pillars; and her knees\nwere hidden (under the flesh), and closely touching each other.\n\n26\\. Her legs were smooth and exquisitely proportioned; her feet exceedingly\ngraceful; her loins fleshy; and her waist like that of a lion\'s cub.\n\n27\\. Her reddish nails shone (like rubies); her beauty was the delight of\nevery looker-on; and with her glances she filled at every step all the\nquarters of the sky as it were with lotus-flowers.\n\n28\\. Radiant with divine lustre, she illuminated all the quarters of the sky\nwith it; her clothing was most exquisite and perfectly white; and she was\ndecorated with the most precious gems.\n\n29\\. With her steps she covered the earth as it were with lotuses; she was\nendowed with beauty and youthful charms; and made her approach with modest\nbearing.\n\n30\\. Having seen her come near, Ka _s_ yapa saluted her reverentially, and\nsaid, \'O handsome lady, O earth, radiant with divine lustre, I am acquainted\nwith thy thoughts.\n\n31\\. \'Go to visit _G_ anardana, O large-eyed lady; he will tell thee\naccurately, how thou shalt henceforth sustain thyself.\n\n32\\. For thy sake, O (goddess), whose face is lovely and whose limbs are\nbeautiful, I have found out, by profound meditation, that his residence is in\nthe Kshiroda (milk-ocean).\'\n\n33\\. The goddess of the earth answered, \'Yes, (I shall do as you bid\nme),saluted Kasyapa reverentially,\n\np. 7\n\nand proceeded to the Kshiroda sea, in order to see Ke _s_ ava (Vish _n_ u).\n\n34\\. She beheld (then) the ocean, from which the Am _ri_ ta arose. It was\nlovely, like the rays of the moon, and agitated by hundreds of waves produced\nby stormy blasts of wind.\n\n35\\. (With its waves) towering like a hundred Himalayas it seemed another\nterrestrial globe, calling near as it were the earth with its hands; the\nrolling waves.\n\n36\\. With those hands it was as it were constantly producing the radiancy of\nthe moon; and every stain of guilt was removed from it by Hari\'s (Vish _n_\nu\'s) residence within its limits.\n\n37\\. Because (it was entirely free from sin) therefore it was possessed of a\npure and shining frame; its colour was white; it was inaccessible to birds and\nits seat was in the lower regions.\n\n38\\. It was rich in blue and tawny gems (sapphires, coral, and others), and\nlooking therefore as if the atmosphere had descended upon the earth, and as if\na number of forests adorned with a multitude of fruits had descended upon its\nsurface.\n\n39\\. Its size was immense, like that of the skin of (Vish _n_ u\'s) serpent _S_\nesha. After having seen the milk-ocean, the goddess of the earth beheld the\ndwelling of Ke _s_ ava (Vish _n_ u) which was in it:\n\n40\\. (His dwelling), the size of which cannot be expressed in words, and, the\nsublimity of which is also beyond the power of utterance. In it she saw the\ndestroyer of Madhu seated upon _S_ esha.\n\n41\\. The lotus of his face was hardly visible on\n\n[37. See 15, note.]\n\np. 8\n\naccount of the lustre of the gems decorating the neck of the snake Sesha; he\nwas shining like a hundred moons; and his splendour was equal to the rays of a\nmyriad of suns.\n\n42\\. He was clad in a yellow robe (radiant like gold); imperturbable;\ndecorated with all kinds of gems; and shining with the lustre of a diadem\nresembling the sun in colour, and with (splendid) ear-rings.\n\n43\\. Lakshmi was stroking his feet with her soft palms; and his attributes\n(the shell, the discus, the mace, and the lotus-flower) wearing bodies were\nattending upon him on all sides.\n\n44\\. Having espied the lotus-eyed slayer of Madhu, she knelt down upon the\nground and addressed him as follows:\n\n45\\. \'When formerly I was sunk into the region of Rasatala, I was raised by\nthee, O God, and restored to my ancient seat, O Vish _n_ u, thanks to thy\nbenevolence towards living beings.\n\n46\\. \'Being there, how am I to maintain myself upon it, O lord of the gods?\'\nHaving been thus addressed by the goddess, the god enunciated the following\nanswer:\n\n47\\. \'Those who practise the duties ordained for each caste and for each\norder, and who act up strictly to the holy law, will sustain thee, O earth; to\nthem is thy care committed.\'\n\n48\\. Having received this answer, the goddess of the earth said to the chief\nof the gods, \'Communicate to me the eternal laws of the castes and of the\norders.\n\n[47. Regarding the four castes and the four orders, see II, 1; III, 3.]\n\np. 9\n\n49\\. I desire to learn them from thee; for thou art my chief stay. Adoration\nbe to thee, O brilliant[1] chief of the gods, who annihilatest the power of\nthe (Daityas and other) enemies of the gods.\n\n50\\. \'O Naraya _n_ a (son of Nara), O _G_ agannatha (sovereign of the world);\nthou holdest the shell, the discus, and the mace (in thy hands); thou hast a\nlotus (Brahman) springing from thy navel; thou art the lord of the senses;\nthou art Most powerful and endowed with conquering strength.\n\n51\\. \'Thou art beyond the cognisance of the senses; thy end is most difficult\nto know; thou art brilliant; thou holdest the bow Sar _n_ ga; thou art the\nboar[1]; thou art terrible; thou art Govinda[2] (the herdsman); thou art of\nold; thou art Purushottama (the spirit supreme).\n\n52\\. \'Thy hair is golden; thy eyes are everywhere; thy body is the sacrifice;\nthou art free from stain; thou art the "field." (the corporeal frame); thou\nart the principle of life; thou art the ruler\n\n[49. 1 This is Nand.\'s interpretation of the term \'deva,\' but it may also be\ntaken in its usual acceptation of \'god.\'\n\n51\\. 1 This is the third of the three interpretations of the term varaha,\nwhich Nand. proposes. According to the first, it would mean \'one who kills his\nworst or most prominent foes;\' according to the second, \'one who gratifies his\nown desires.\' But these two interpretations are based upon a fanciful\nderivation of varaha from vara and a-han. Of many others among the epithets\nNand. proposes equally fanciful etymologies, which I shall pass over\nunnoticed.--\n\n2 This epithet, which literally means \'he who finds or wins cows,\' is usually\nreferred to Vishnu\'s recovering the \'cow,\' i.e. the earth, when it was lost in\nthe waters: see Mahabh. XII, 13228, which verse is quoted both by Nand. and by\n_S_ a _n_ kara in his Commentary on the Vish _n_ u-sahasranama. It originally\nrefers, no doubt, to Vishnu or Krishna as the pastoral god.]\n\np. 10\n\nof the world; thou art lying on the bed of the ocean.\n\n53\\. \'Thou art Mantra (prayer); thou knowest the Mantras; thou surpassest all\nconception; thy frame is composed of the Vedas and Veda _n_ gas; the creation\nand destruction of this whole world is effected through thee.\n\n54\\. \'Thou knowest right and wrong; thy body is law; law springs from thee;\ndesires are gratified by thee: thy powers are everywhere; thou art\n(imperishable like) Amrita (ambrosia); thou art heaven; thou art the destroyer\nof Madhu and Kai _t_ asa.\n\n55\\. \'Thou causest the increase of the great thou art inscrutable; thou art\nall thou givest shelter to all; thou art the chief one thou art free from sin;\nthou art _G_ imuta; thou art inexhaustible; thou art the creator.\n\n56\\. \'Thou increasest the welfare (of the world), the waters spring from thee;\nthou art the seat of intelligence; action is not found in thee; thou presidest\nover seven chief things[1]; thou art the teacher of religious rites; thou art\nof old; thou art Purushottama.\n\n57, \'Thou art not to be shaken; thou art undecaying;\n\n[55. \'The great (b _ri_ hat) means time, space, and the like. . . . He is\ncalled "all" because he is capable of assuming any shape.\' (Nand.) The sense\nof the term \' _g_ imuta,\' as an epithet of divine beings, is uncertain.\nAccording to Nand., it would mean \'he who sprinkles living beings;\' but this\ninterpretation is based upon a fanciful derivation, from _g_ iva and\nmutrayati.\n\n56\\. 1 This refers either to the seven divisions of a Saman; or to the seven\nspecies, of which each of the three kinds of sacrifices, domestic offerings,\nburnt-offerings, and Soma-sacrifices, consists (cf. Gaut. VIII, 18-20); or to\nthe seven worlds (see 15, note), Bhur and the rest. (Nand.)]\n\np. 11\n\nthou art the producer of the atoms; thou art kind to faithful attendants; thou\nart the purifier (of sinners); thou art the protector of all the gods thou art\nthe protector of the pious.\n\n58\\. \'Thou art also the protector of those who know the Veda, O Purushottama.\nI have come, O _G_ agannatha, to the immovable Va _k_ aspati (the lord of holy\nspeech), the lord;\n\n59\\. \'To him, who is very pious; invincible; Vasushe _n_ a (who has treasures\nfor his armies); who bestows largesses upon his followers, who is endowed with\nthe power of intense devotion; who is the germ of the ether; from whom the\nrays (of the sun and moon) proceed;\n\n60\\. \'To Vasudeva; the great soul of the universe; whose eyes are like\nlotuses; who is eternal; the preceptor of the Suras and of the Asuras;\nbrilliant; omnipresent; the great lord of all creatures;\n\n61\\. \'Who has one body and four faces; who is the producer of (the five\ngrosser elements, ether, air, fire, water, and earth), the producers of the\nworld. Teach me concisely, O Bhagavat, the eternal laws ordained for the\naggregate of the four castes,\n\n62\\. \'Together with the customs to be observed by each order and with the\nsecret ordinances.\' The chief of the gods, thus addressed by the goddess of\nthe earth, replied to her as follows:\n\n[62. According to Nand., the term rahasya, \'secret ordinances or doctrines,\'\nhas to be referred either to the laws regarding the occupations lawful for\neach caste in times of distress see II, 15), or to the penances (XLVI seq.)\nThe latter interpretation seems to be the more plausible one, with the\nlimitation, however, that rahasya is only used to denote the penances for\nsecret faults, which are termed rahasya in LV, 1.]\n\np. 12\n\n63\\. Learn from me, in a concise form, O radiant goddess of the earth, the\neternal laws for the aggregate of the four castes, together with the customs\nto be observed by each order, and with the secret ordinances,\n\n64\\. \'Which will effect the final liberation of the virtuous persons, who will\nsupport thee. Be seated upon this splendid golden seat, O handsome-thighed\ngoddess.\n\n65\\. \'Seated at ease, listen to me proclaiming the sacred laws.\' The goddess\nof the earth, thereupon, seated at case, listened to the sacred precepts as,\nthey came from the mouth of Vish _n_ u.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II.](sbe07004.htm)\n\n'
