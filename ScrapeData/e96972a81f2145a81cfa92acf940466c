They came at the start\nof my life\'s journey, like the first streak of dawn, giving me golden\nprovision to carry me on my way.\n\nThe sky which gives light is blue, and my mother\'s face was dark, but she had\nthe radiance of holiness, and her beauty would put to shame all the vanity of\nthe beautiful.\n\nEveryone says that I resemble my mother. In my childhood I used to resent\nthis. It made me angry with my mirror. I thought that it was God\'s unfairness\nwhich was wrapped round my limbs--that my dark features were not my due, but\nhad come to me by some misunderstanding. All that remained for me to ask of my\nGod in reparation was, that I might grow up to be a model of what woman should\nbe, as one reads it in some epic poem.\n\nWhen the proposal came for my marriage, an astrologer was sent, who consulted\nmy palm and said, "This girl has good signs. She will become an ideal wife."\n\nAnd all the women who heard it said: "No wonder, for she resembles her\nmother."\n\nI was married into a Rajah\'s house. When I was a child, I was quite familiar\nwith the description of the Prince of the fairy story. But my husband\'s face\nwas not of a kind that one\'s imagination would place in fairyland. It was\ndark, even as mine was. The feeling of shrinking, which I had about my own\nlack of physical beauty, was lifted a little; at the same time a touch of\nregret was left lingering in my heart.\n\nBut when the physical appearance evades the scrutiny of our senses and enters\nthe sanctuary of our hearts, then it can forget itself. I know, from my\nchildhood\'s experience, how devotion is beauty itself, in its inner aspect.\nWhen my mother arranged the different fruits, carefully peeled by her own\nloving hands, on the white stone plate, and gently waved her fan to drive away\nthe flies while my father sat down to his meals, her service would lose itself\nin a beauty which passed beyond outward forms. Even in my infancy I could feel\nits power. It transcended all debates, or doubts, or calculations: it was pure\nmusic.\n\nI distinctly remember after my marriage, when, early in the morning, I would\ncautiously and silently get up and take the dust  3 of my husband\'s feet\nwithout waking him, how at such moments I could feel the vermilion mark upon\nmy forehead shining out like the morning star.\n\nOne day, he happened to awake, and smiled as he asked me: "What is that,\nBimala? What _are_ you doing?"\n\nI can never forget the shame of being detected by him. He might possibly have\nthought that I was trying to earn merit secretly. But no, no! That had nothing\nto do with merit. It was my woman\'s heart, which must worship in order to\nlove.\n\nMy father-in-law\'s house was old in dignity from the days of the _Badshahs_.\nSome of its manners were of the Moguls and Pathans, some of its customs of\nManu and Parashar. But my husband was absolutely modern. He was the first of\nthe house to go through a college course and take his M.A. degree. His elder\nbrother had died young, of drink, and had left no children. My husband did not\ndrink and was not given to dissipation. So foreign to the family was this\nabstinence, that to many it hardly seemed decent! Purity, they imagined, was\nonly becoming in those on whom fortune had not smiled. It is the moon which\nhas room for stains, not the stars.\n\nMy husband\'s parents had died long ago, and his old grandmother was mistress\nof the house. My husband was the apple of her eye, the jewel on her bosom. And\nso he never met with much difficulty in overstepping any of the ancient\nusages. When he brought in Miss Gilby, to teach me and be my companion, he\nstuck to his resolve in spite of the poison secreted by all the wagging\ntongues at home and outside.\n\nMy husband had then just got through his B.A. examination and was reading for\nhis M.A. degree; so he had to stay in Calcutta to attend college. He used to\nwrite to me almost every day, a few lines only, and simple words, but his\nbold, round handwriting would look up into my face, oh, so tenderly! I kept\nhis letters in a sandalwood box and covered them every day with the flowers I\ngathered in the garden.\n\nAt that time the Prince of the fairy tale had faded, like the moon in the\nmorning light. I had the Prince of my real world enthroned in my heart. I was\nhis queen. I had my seat by his side. But my real joy was, that my true place\nwas at his feet.\n\nSince then, I have been educated, and introduced to the modern age in its own\nlanguage, and therefore these words that I write seem to blush with shame in\ntheir prose setting. Except for my acquaintance with this modern standard of\nlife, I should know, quite naturally, that just as my being born a woman was\nnot in my own hands, so the element of devotion in woman\'s love is not like a\nhackneyed passage quoted from a romantic poem to be piously written down in\nround hand in a school-girl\'s copy-book.\n\nBut my husband would not give me any opportunity for worship. That was his\ngreatness. They are cowards who claim absolute devotion from their wives as\ntheir right; that is a humiliation for both.\n\nHis love for me seemed to overflow my limits by its flood of wealth and\nservice. But my necessity was more for giving than for receiving; for love is\na vagabond, who can make his flowers bloom in the wayside dust, better than in\nthe crystal jars kept in the drawing-room.\n\nMy husband could not break completely with the old-time traditions which\nprevailed in our family. It was difficult, therefore, for us to meet at any\nhour of the day we pleased.  4 I knew exactly the time that he could come to\nme, and therefore our meeting had all the care of loving preparation. It was\nlike the rhyming of a poem; it had to come through the path of the metre.\n\nAfter finishing the day\'s work and taking my afternoon bath, I would do up my\nhair and renew my vermilion mark and put on my _sari_ , carefully crinkled;\nand then, bringing back my body and mind from all distractions of household\nduties, I would dedicate it at this special hour, with special ceremonies, to\none individual. That time, each day, with him was short; but it was infinite.\n\nMy husband used to say, that man and wife are equal in love because of their\nequal claim on each other. I never argued the point with him, but my heart\nsaid that devotion never stands in the way of true equality; it only raises\nthe level of the ground of meeting. Therefore the joy of the higher equality\nremains permanent; it never slides down to the vulgar level of triviality.\n\nMy beloved, it was worthy of you that you never expected worship from me. But\nif you had accepted it, you would have done me a real service. You showed your\nlove by decorating me, by educating me, by giving me what I asked for, and\nwhat I did not. I have seen what depth of love there was in your eyes when you\ngazed at me. I have known the secret sigh of pain you suppressed in your love\nfor me. You loved my body as if it were a flower of paradise. You loved my\nwhole nature as if it had been given you by some rare providence.\n\nSuch lavish devotion made me proud to think that the wealth was all my own\nwhich drove you to my gate. But vanity such as this only checks the flow of\nfree surrender in a woman\'s love. When I sit on the queen\'s throne and claim\nhomage, then the claim only goes on magnifying itself; it is never satisfied.\nCan there be any real happiness for a woman in merely feeling that she has\npower over a man? To surrender one\'s pride in devotion is woman\'s only\nsalvation.\n\nIt comes back to me today how, in the days of our happiness, the fires of envy\nsprung up all around us. That was only natural, for had I not stepped into my\ngood fortune by a mere chance, and without deserving it? But providence does\nnot allow a run of luck to last for ever, unless its debt of honour be fully\npaid, day by day, through many a long day, and thus made secure. God may grant\nus gifts, but the merit of being able to take and hold them must be our own.\nAlas for the boons that slip through unworthy hands!\n\nMy husband\'s grandmother and mother were both renowned for their beauty. And\nmy widowed sister-in-law was also of a beauty rarely to be seen. When, in\nturn, fate left them desolate, the grandmother vowed she would not insist on\nhaving beauty for her remaining grandson when he married. Only the auspicious\nmarks with which I was endowed gained me an entry into this family--\notherwise, I had no claim to be here.\n\nIn this house of luxury, but few of its ladies had received their meed of\nrespect. They had, however, got used to the ways of the family, and managed to\nkeep their heads above water, buoyed up by their dignity as _Ranis_ of an\nancient house, in spite of their daily tears being drowned in the foam of\nwine, and by the tinkle of the dancing girls\' anklets. Was the credit due to\nme that my husband did not touch liquor, nor squander his manhood in the\nmarkets of woman\'s flesh? What charm did I know to soothe the wild and\nwandering mind of men? It was my good luck, nothing else. For fate proved\nutterly callous to my sister-in-law. Her festivity died out, while yet the\nevening was early, leaving the light of her beauty shining in vain over empty\nhalls--burning and burning, with no accompanying music!\n\nHis sister-in-law affected a contempt for my husband\'s modern notions. How\nabsurd to keep the family ship, laden with all the weight of its time-honoured\nglory, sailing under the colours of his slip of a girl-wife alone! Often have\nI felt the lash of scorn. "A thief who had stolen a husband\'s love!" "A sham\nhidden in the shamelessness of her new-fangled finery!" The many-coloured\ngarments of modern fashion with which my husband loved to adorn me roused\njealous wrath. "Is not she ashamed to make a show-window of herself--and with\nher looks, too!"\n\nMy husband was aware of all this, but his gentleness knew no bounds. He used\nto implore me to forgive her.\n\nI remember I once told him: "Women\'s minds are so petty. so crooked!" "Like\nthe feet of Chinese women," he replied. "Has not the pressure of society\ncramped them into pettiness and crookedness? They are but pawns of the fate\nwhich gambles with them. What responsibility have they of their own?"\n\nMy sister-in-law never failed to get from my husband whatever she wanted. He\ndid not stop to consider whether her requests were right or reasonable. But\nwhat exasperated me most was that she was not grateful for this. I had\npromised my husband that I would not talk back at her, but this set me raging\nall the more, inwardly. I used to feel that goodness has a limit, which, if\npassed, somehow seems to make men cowardly. Shall I tell the whole truth? I\nhave often wished that my husband had the manliness to be a little less good.\n\nMy sister-in-law, the Bara Rani,  5 was still young and had no pretensions to\nsaintliness. Rather, her talk and jest and laugh inclined to be forward. The\nyoung maids with whom she surrounded herself were also impudent to a degree.\nBut there was none to gainsay her--for was not this the custom of the house?\nIt seemed to me that my good fortune in having a stainless husband was a\nspecial eyesore to her. He, however, felt more the sorrow of her lot than the\ndefects of her character.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1](hw01.htm#fr_0) The mark of Hindu wifehood and the symbol of all the\ndevotion that it implies.\n\n[2](hw01.htm#fr_1) The _sari_ is the dress of the Hindu woman.\n\n[3](hw01.htm#fr_2) Taking the dust of the feet is a formal offering of\nreverence and is done by lightly touching the feet of the revered one and then\none\'s own head with the same hand.
