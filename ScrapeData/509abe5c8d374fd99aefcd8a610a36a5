He now offers (the first of) the two Rauhi _n_ a (cakes) 2:--(Va\n_g_. S. XXXVII, 21), 'May the day\n\np. 473\n\nbe pleased with its brightness, the well-lighted with its light, hail!' with\nthis text both (cakes are offered) in the morning;--'May the night be pleased\nwith its brightness, the well-lighted with its light, hail!' with this text\nboth (cakes are offered) in the evening.\n\n14:2:1:22\\. And as to why he offers two Rauhi _n_ a (cakes),--the two Rauhi\n_n_ as doubtless are Agni and \xc3\x82ditya (the sun), for by means of these two\ndeities sacrificers ascend (ruh) to heaven.\n\n14:2:1:33\\. And, indeed, the Rauhi _n_ as are also day and night, and the\nPravargya is the sun: he thus encompasses yonder sun by the day and the night,\nwhence he is encompassed by the day and the night.\n\n14:2:1:44\\. And, indeed, the Rauhi _n_ as are also these two\n\np. 474\n\nworlds, and the Pravargya is the sun: he thus encompasses yonder sun by these\ntwo worlds, whence he is encompassed by these two worlds.\n\n14:2:1:55\\. And, indeed, the Rauhi _n_ as are also the two eyes, and the\nPravargya is the head: he thus places the eye in the head.\n\n14:2:1:66\\. He now takes a rope, with (Va _g_. S. XXXVIII, 1), 'At the impulse\nof the divine Savit _ri_ , I take thee, with the arms of the A _s_ vins, with\nthe hands of Pushan: Aditi's 1 zone thou art;'--the mystic import of this is\nthe same as before 2.\n\n14:2:1:77\\. He then calls the cow, whilst stepping behind the Garhapatya (Va\n_g_. S. XXXVIII, 2), 'I _d_ a, come hither! Aditi, come hither! Sarasvati,\ncome hither!' for the cow is I _d_ a, and the cow is Aditi, and the cow is\nSarasvati. And he also calls her by her (real) name, with these (formulas),\n'N.N. 3, come hither!' thus thrice.\n\n14:2:1:88\\. When she comes, he lays (the rope) round her (horns), with (Va\n_g_. S. XXXVIII, 3), 'Aditi's zone thou art, Indra _n_ i's head-band;'--for\nIndra _n_ i is Indra's beloved wife, and she has a most variegated head-band:\n'that thou art' he thereby means to say, and that he indeed thereby makes it\nto be.\n\n14:2:1:99\\. He then lets the calf to it (to suck), with, 'Pushan thou art,'--\nPushan, doubtless, is he that blows here (the wind), for that one supports 4\n\np. 475\n\n[paragraph continues] (push) all this (universe); and the Pravargya also is\nthat (wind): it is him he thus pleases, and therefore he says, 'Pushan thou\nart.'\n\n14:2:1:1010\\. He then leads it (the calf) away 1 with, 'Afford (milk) for the\nGharma!' for the Gharma, doubtless, is that fluid which this (cow) lets flow:\nhe thus means to say thereby, 'Allow her a share!'\n\n14:2:1:1111\\. He then causes it to flow into the milking-bowl, with (Va _g_.\nS. XX XVIII, 4), 'Flow for the A _s_ vins!'--with regard to the A _s_ vins he\nthus says this, for it was the A _s_ vins who restored the head of the\nsacrifice: it is them he thus pleases, and therefore he says, 'Flow for the A\n_s_ vins!'\n\n14:2:1:1212, 'Flow for Sarasvati!'--Sarasvati, doubtless, is Speech, and with\nspeech the A _s_ vins then restored the head of the Sacrifice: it is those (A\n_s_ vins) he thus pleases, and therefore he says, 'Flow for Sarasvati!'\n\n14:2:1:1313\\. 'Flow for Indra!'--for Indra is the deity of the sacrifice, and\nit was indeed by him who is the deity of the sacrifice that the A _s_ vins\nthen restored the head of the sacrifice: it is them he thus pleases, and\ntherefore he says, 'Flow for Indra!'\n\n14:2:1:1414\\. The (spilt) drops he then consecrates with, 'Hail, possessed of\nIndra! hail, possessed of Indra!' for Indra is the deity of the sacrifice: he\nthus pleases him who is the deity of the sacrifice, and therefore he says,\n'Hail, possessed of Indra! hail, possessed of Indra!' Thrice he says it, for\nthreefold is the sacrifice. The call of 'hail!' he places first, and the deity\nlast: the significance of this is the same as before.\n\np. 476\n\n14:2:1:1515\\. He then touches her udder 1, with (Va _g_. S. XXXVIII, 5; _Ri_\ng-v. I, 164, 49), 'This ever-flowing, grateful udder of thine,'--that is to\nsay, 'This udder of thine placed in secret 2;'--'treasure-giving, wealth-\ngranting, bountiful,'--that is to say, 'which is a giver of treasures, a\ngranter of wealth, and precious;'--'whereby thou furtherest all desirable\nthings,'--that is to say, 'whereby thou supportest all the gods and all\ncreatures;'--'O Sarasvati, move that hither for us to suck,'--Sarasvati,\ndoubtless, is Speech, and so is this (cow) which yields the Gharma milk; and\nSpeech is worship: thus he means to say, 'Grant us worship whereby we may\nplease the gods.' He then steps up to the site of the Garhapatya with, 'I pass\nalong the wide aerial realm,'--the mystic import of this is the same as before\n3.\n\n14:2:1:1616\\. He then takes the two lifting-sticks 4, with (Va _g_. S.\nXXXVIII, 6), 'The Gayatri metre thou art,--the Trish _t_ ubh metre thou art,'\n--he thus takes them with both the Gayatri and the Trish _t_ ubh\nmetres;--'with heaven and earth I encompass thee,'--for the two lifting-sticks\nare indeed these two, heaven and earth; and the\n\np. 477\n\n[paragraph continues] Pravargya is the sun: he thus encompasses yonder sun\nwithin these two, heaven and earth. Thereupon (having lifted up the pot) he\nsweeps it clean with a branch of reed grass: the mystic import of this is the\nsame as before.\n\n14:2:1:1717\\. He then puts it on the 'supporting' tray 1 with, 'By the air I\nsupport thee,'--for the 'supporting' tray is the air, since everything here is\nsupported by the air; and the 'supporting' tray also is the belly, for all\nfood and drink here is supported (held) by the belly: therefore he says, 'By\nthe air I support thee.'\n\n14:2:1:1818\\. He then pours in the goat's milk 2; for that (Mahavira pot) when\nheated, becomes glowing: he thus soothes it, and when soothed he pours the\ncow's milk into it--\n\n14:2:1:1919\\. With, 'O Indra and ye A _s_ vins!'--for Indra is the deity of\nthe sacrifice, and he thus pleases him who is the deity of the sacrifice; and\n'Ye A _s_ vins' he says, because the A _s_ vins at that time restored the head\nof the sacrifice, and it is them he thus pleases: therefore he says, 'O Indra\nand ye A _s_ vins!'\n\n14:2:1:2020\\. 'Of bees' honey'--this is indeed honey;--'drink ye the Gharma\n(hot draught),'--that is to say, drink ye the liquor;'--'ye true ones,'--those\n(deities) are indeed true (vasu), for it is\n\np. 478\n\nthey that maintain (vasaya) all this (universe);--'worship ye, va _t_!' thus\nthis comes to be for him as if it were offered with the Vasha _t_ -call.\n\n14:2:1:2121\\. 'Hail to Surya's ray, the rain-winner 1!'--for one of the sun's\nrays is called 'rain-winner,' whereby he supports all these creatures: it is\nthat one he thus pleases, and therefore he says, 'Hail to Surya's ray, the\nrain-winner!' The call of hail he places first, and the deity last: the\nsignificance of this is the same as before 2.\n\n14:2:1:2222\\. And, verily, whosoever either teaches, or partakes of, this\n(Pravargya) enters that life, and that light: the observance thereof is the\nsame as at the creation 3.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[472:2](sbe44121.htm#fr_1256) According to the Sutras and the Taitt. \xc3\x82r., the\nsouthern cake p. 473 is offered at this juncture of the performance, whilst\nthe northern one is offered later on (see [XIV, 2, 2,\n41](sbe44122.htm#14:2:2:41)). For both cakes one and the same text is used,\nviz. the first of the two here mentioned at the morning performance, whilst\nthe second is used at the afternoon performance. The cakes, being one-kapala\nones (the two 'rauhi _n_ ahavani' ladles serving as kapalas), must be offered\nentire. Cf. Katy. XXVI, 4, 14; 6, 18; \xc3\x82past. XV, 10, 1; 11, 5; 12, 7; Taitt.\n\xc3\x82r. IV, 10, 4. Though our Brahma _n_ a expresses itself in a rather peculiar\nway, its statement, here and at [XIV, 2, 2, 41](sbe44122.htm#14:2:2:41), is\nperhaps meant to imply the same mode of procedure. If this is the case, the\ntwo paragraphs would mean,--at this juncture of the two performances he offers\nthe two southern (northern, at [XIV, 2, 2, 41](sbe44122.htm#14:2:2:41)) cakes,\n--the two cakes (the southern and the northern one) of the morning performance\nrequiring the first, and those of the afternoon performance the second, text.\nIt is not impossible, however, that the author intends a different mode of\nprocedure or wishes to leave it purposely vague. If we were to read 'rauhi _n_\nam' for 'rauhi _n_ au,' the text would be more in accordance with the practice\nprescribed in the Sutras. Cf. also Mahidh. (on Va _g_. S. XXXVII, 21)--where\nread 'rauhi _n_ au' instead of 'pravargyau'--who adopts the procedure here\nexplained.\n\n[474:1](sbe44121.htm#fr_1257) The edition omits 'adityai,' and reads\n'devebhyas' for 'devasya.'\n\n[474:2](sbe44121.htm#fr_1258) See I, 2, 4, 4; 3, 1, 15.\n\n[474:3](sbe44121.htm#fr_1259) As, for instance, Dhavali, or Ga\xe1\xb9\x85ga.\n\n[474:4](sbe44121.htm#fr_1260) Or nourishes, makes grow, inasmuch as it brings\nabout rain (Mahidhara).\n\n[475:1](sbe44121.htm#fr_1261) Whilst the calf is sucking, he secures the cow\nby tying together her hind legs.\n\n[476:1](sbe44121.htm#fr_1262) Or, one of the teats (stanam); according to\nMahidhara, the part is used for the whole; and the Ka _n_ va recension indeed\nreads 'stanan' (the teats); cf. Katy, XXVI, 5, 7, comm.\n\n[476:2](sbe44121.htm#fr_1263) The author apparently derives ' _s_ a _s_ aya'\n(? perennial, inexhaustible) from ' _s_ i,' to lie, sleep, as does Mahidhara.\n\n[476:3](sbe44121.htm#fr_1264) Viz. as at I, 1, 2, 4.--According to Katy. XXVI,\n5, 10 seq., the Hot _ri_ says, 'Arise, Brahma _n_ aspati!' whereupon the\nAdhvaryu rises; and the Hot _ri_ again calling, 'Hasten up with the milk!' he\nsteps up to the Garhapatya.\n\n[476:4](sbe44121.htm#fr_1265) See [p. 458](sbe44118.htm#page_458), note\n[1](sbe44118.htm#fn_1211).\n\n[477:1](sbe44121.htm#fr_1266) The 'upayamani' is apparently a kind of bowl, or\nhollow tray of hard (udumbara) wood, somewhat larger than the (bowls of the)\nspoons or ladles used on this occasion, and, indeed, also itself used as such.\n\n[477:2](sbe44121.htm#fr_1267) Whilst the Adhvaryu was milking the cow into the\nearthen bowl (pinvana), his assistant, the Pratiprasthat _ri_ , silently\nmilked a goat tied to the peg.\n\n[478:1](sbe44121.htm#fr_1268) According to Taitt. \xc3\x82r. IV, 8, 4; \xc3\x82past. XV, 10,\n2, this formula is addressed to the steam rising from the Mahavira pot--it\nbeing accordingly modified to 'I offer thee to Surya's ray, the rain-winner.'\n\n[478:2](sbe44121.htm#fr_1269) [XIV, 1, 3, 26](sbe44119.htm#14:1:3:26).\n\n[478:3](sbe44121.htm#fr_1270) See [p. 458](sbe44118.htm#page_458), note\n[1](sbe44118.htm#fn_1211).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIV, 2, 2.
