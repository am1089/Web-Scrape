A scene of\ngreat splendour was unfolded to their eyes. At dawn many flags and garlands of\nflowers had been distributed round the enclosure; they adorned the stately\nroyal pavilion, which was agleam with gold and jewels and hung with trophies\nof war; they fluttered above the side galleries for the lords and the ladies,\nand even among the clustering trees. White tents for the warriors occupied a\nbroad green space. A great altar had been erected by Drona beside a cool,\ntransparent stream, on which to offer up sacrifices to the gods.\n\nFrom early morn the murmurous throng awaited the coming of king and\ncounsellors, and royal ladies, and especially the mighty princes who were to\ndisplay their feats of arms and engage in mimic warfare. The bright sun shone\nin beauty on that festal day.\n\nThe clarion notes of the instruments of war proclaimed the coming of the king.\nThen entered the royal procession,\n\np. 186\n\nand blind Dhritarashtra was led towards his throne in the gleaming pavilion.\nWith him came the fair queen Gandhari, mother of the Kauravas, and stately\nPritha, widow of King Pandu, the mother of the Pandavas. There followed in\ntheir train many high-born dames and numerous sweet maidens renowned for their\nbeauty. When all these ladies, attired in many-coloured robes and glittering\nwith jewels and bright flowers, were mounting the decorated galleries, they\nseemed like to goddesses and heavenly nymphs ascending to the golden summit of\nthe mountain of Meru. . . . The trumpets were sounding loud, and the clamour\nwhich arose from the surging multitude of people of every caste and every age\nand every tribe was like the voice of heaving ocean in sublime tempest.\n\nNext came venerable and white-haired Drona, robed in white, with white\nsacrificial cord; his sandals were white, and the garlands he wore were white\nalso. His valiant son, Aswatthama, followed him as the red planet Mars follows\nthe white moon in cloudless heaven. The saintly preceptor advanced to the\naltar where the priestly choir gathered, and offered up sacrifices to the gods\nand chanted holy texts.\n\nThen heralds sounded their trumpets as the youthful princes entered in bright\narray, bejewelled and lightly girded for exercise, their left arms bound with\nleather. They were wearing breastplates; their quivers were slung from their\nshoulders, and they carried stately bows and gleaming swords. The princes\nfiled in according to their years, and Yudhishthira came first of all. Each\nsaluted Drona in turn and awaited his commands.\n\nOne by one the youthful warriors displayed their skill at arms, while the vast\ncrowd shouted their plaudits. The regent Bhishma, sitting on the right side of\nthe throne,\n\np. 187\n\nlooked down with delight, and Vidura, sitting on the left side, informed the\nsightless king of all that took place.\n\nThe princes shot arrows at targets, first on foot and then mounted on rapid\nsteeds, 1 displaying great skill; they also rode on elephants and in chariots,\nand their arrows ever flew with unerring aim.\n\nNext they engaged in mimic warfare, charging with chariots and on elephants:\nswords clamoured on shields, ponderous maces were wielded, and falchions\nshimmered like to the flashes of lightning. The movements of the princes,\nmounted and on foot, were rapid and graceful; they were fearless in action and\nfirm-footed, and greatly skilled in thrust and parry.\n\nBut ere long the conflict was waged with more than mimic fury. Proud\nDuryodhana and powerful Bhima had sought one another and were drawn apart from\ntheir peers. They towered on the plain with uplifted maces, and they seemed\nlike two rival elephants about to fight for a mate. Then they charged with\nwhirling weapons, and the combat was terrible to behold.\n\nVidura pictured the conflict to blind Dhritarashtra, as did Pritha also to the\nblindfolded Queen Gandhari. Round the barriers the multitudes swayed and\nclamoured, some favouring Duryodhana and others mighty Bhima.\n\nThe princes fought on, and their fury increased until at length it seemed that\none or the other would be slain. But while yet the issue hung doubtful, Drona,\nwhose brow was troubled, marked with concern the menacing crowd, which was\nsuspended with hope and fear, and seemed like an ocean shaken by fitful gusts\nof changing wind. Then he interposed, bidding his son to separate the angry\ncombatants so that the turmoil might have end.\n\np. 188\n\n[paragraph continues] The princes heard and obeyed, and they retired slowly\nlike ocean billows, tempest-swollen, falling apart.\n\nTo allay excitement, trumpet and drum were sounded aloud. Then white-haired\nDrona stepped forward, and in a voice like thunder summoned brave Arjuna to\ncome forth.\n\nFirst of all the valiant hero performed a sacred rite. Thereafter he came\nbefore the multitude in all his splendour, clad in golden armour, like to a\nglorious evening cloud. Modestly he strode, while trumpets blared and the\ndrums bellowed, and he seemed a very god. He was girdled with jewels, and he\ncarried a mighty bow. As the people applauded and shouted his praises, Pritha,\nhis mother, looked down, and tears dropped from her eyes. The blind king spake\nto Vidura, saying: "Why are the multitudes shouting now like to the tumultuous\nsea?"\n\nSaid Vidura: "The valiant son of Pritha hath come forth in golden armour, and\nthe people hail him with joy.\n\nThe blind monarch said: "I am well pleased. The sons of Pritha sanctify the\nkingdom like to sacrificial fires."\n\nSilence fell upon the people, and Drona bade his favourite pupil to display\nhis skill. Arjuna performed wonders with magic arms; he created fire by the\n_Agneya_ weapon, water by the _Varuna_ weapon, wind by the _Vayavya_ weapon,\nclouds by the _Paryanya_ weapon, land by the _Bhanma_ weapon, and he caused\nmountains to appear by the _Parvatya_ weapon. Then by the _Antardhyana_ weapon\nhe caused all these to vanish. 1\n\nArjuna then set up for his target an iron image of\n\np. 189\n\na great boar, and at one bending of the bow he shot five arrows into its\ngaping jaws. Wondrous was his skill. Next he suspended a cow horn, which\nswayed constantly in the wind, and discharged into its hollow with unerring\naim twenty rapid arrows. Heaven and earth resounded with the plaudits of the\npeople when he leapt into his chariot and discharged clouds of arrows as he\nwas driven speedily round the grounds. Having thus displayed his\naccomplishments as an archer, he drew his sword, which he wielded so rapidly\nround and about that the people thought they beheld lightning and heard\nthunder. Ere he left the field he cast the noose with exceeding great skill,\ncapturing horses and cows and scampering deer at a single throw. Then Drona\nembraced him, and the people shouted his praises.\n\nGreat was the joy of the Pandavas as they rested around Drona like to the\nstars that gather about the white moon in heaven. The Kauravas were grouped\naround Aswatthama as the gods gather beside Indra when the giant Daityas\nthreaten to assail high heaven. Duryodhana\'s heart burned with jealous anger\nbecause of the triumph achieved by Arjuna.\n\nEvening came on, and it seemed that the tournament was ended; the crowds began\nto melt away. Then, of a sudden, a mighty tumult of plaudits broke forth, and\nthe loud din of weapons and clank of armour was heard all over the place.\nEvery eye immediately turned towards the gate, and the warriors and the people\nbeheld approaching an unknown warrior, who shook his weapons so that they\nrattled loudly.\n\nSo came mighty Karna, son of Surya, the sun god, and of Pritha, the mother of\nthe three Pandavas--Arjuna, Bhima, and wise Yudhishthira. He was comely as a\nshining god, clad in golden armour, and wearing celestial\n\np. 190\n\near-rings. In his right hand he carried a great many-coloured bow; his\ngleaming falchion was on his thigh. Tall as a cliff he strode forward; he was\nan elephant in his fury, a lion in his wrath; stately as a palm tree was that\ntamer of foemen, so fearless and so proud, so dauntless and so self-possessed.\n\nHe paused in the centre of the plain and surveyed the people with pride.\nStiffly he paid homage to Drona and Kripa. Then he, the eldest son of Pritha,\nspake to Pritha\'s youngest son, Arjuna, the brothers being unknown one to\nanother, and he said: "Whatever feats thou hast performed this day with vain\nboast, Arjuna, these will I accomplish and surpass, if Drona will permit me."\n\nHis voice was like to thunder in heaven, and the multitude of people sprang up\nand uttered cries of wonder. Duryodhana and the other sons of Kuru heard the\nchallenge with glad hearts, but Arjuna remained silent, while his eyes flashed\nfire.\n\nThen Drona gave the warrior permission to display his skill. Karna was well\npleased, and he performed every feat which had given Arjuna fame on that great\nday.\n\nDuryodhana proclaimed his joy with beaming countenance, and he embraced Karna,\nwhom he hailed as "\'brother", saying: "I bid thee welcome, thou mighty\nwarrior. Thou hast won the honours of the field. Demand from me whatsoever\nthou dost desire in this kingdom, and it will be given unto thee."\n\nSaid Karna: "Thy word is thy bond, O prince. All I seek is to combat against\nArjuna, whom I have equalled so far. Fain would I win the victor\'s renown."\n\nDuryodhana said: "Thou dost ask for a worthy boon indeed. Be our ally, and let\nthe enemy fear thee."\n\np. 191\n\nArjuna was moved to great wrath, and cried out: "Uninvited chief! Boasting\nthus, thou wouldst fain be regarded as mine equal, but I will so deal with\nthee that thou wilt die the death of a braggart who cometh here an unbidden\nguest, speaking boastfully ere thou art spoken to."\n\nSaid Karna, answering proudly and calm: "Waste not words, Arjuna, nor taunt me\nwith coming hither uninvited. The field of combat is free to all warriors;\nthey enter by their valour, and do not await until thou dost call them; they\nwin their places by strength and skill, and their warrant is the sword.\nWrathful speech is the weapon of a coward. Do not boast of thy pastimes or be\nvain of thy bloodless feats. Speak with thine arrows, O Arjuna, until, in\nDrona\'s presence, mine will cause all men to wonder, flying towards thee."\n\nDrona was stirred to wrath, and spake to Arjuna, saying: "Canst thou hear him\nboast in this manner? I give thee leave to fight him here and now."\n\nArjuna at once strode forward, fully armed, and he was supported by Drona and\nBhishma. Duryodhana and his band stood by Karna. Then the two warriors\nprepared for single combat, but not in mimic warfare.\n\nThick clouds gathered in the sky; lightning flashed and thunder pealed; the\nmighty Indra guarded his son Arjuna, who stood in shadow. Surya, the sun god,\ncast a shaft of light athwart the darkening plain, and Karna\'s golden armour\ngleamed bright and fair.\n\nThe noble dames looked on, and some praised Arjuna and others praised Karna.\nPritha, the mother of both heroes, was alone divided in her love. She knew her\nfirstborn by his voice and noble bearing and by his armour, and her heart was\ntorn with grief to behold the two brothers ready to slay each other. A cloud\nblinded\n\np. 192\n\nher eyes, and, uttering a low cry, she swooned where she sat. Vidura sprinkled\nwater on her face, and she was revived. Then she wept bitterly because that\nshe could not reveal the secret of Karna\'s birth.\n\nKripa, 1 the foster-brother of Bhishma, performed the duties of herald, and as\nArjuna strode forth to combat he proclaimed: "Behold! this is mighty Arjuna,\nof Bharata\'s great line, son of Pandu and of Pritha, a prince of valour and\nworth who will not shrink from battle. Unknown and long-armed chief," he said\nunto Karna, "declare now thy name and lineage, the royal house thou dost\nadorn, and the names of thy sire and thy mother. Know thou that by the rules\nof single combat the sons of kings cannot contend against low-born or nameless\nrivals."\n\nKarna heard, but was silent. He hung his head like the dew-laden lotus bloom;\nhe could claim nor lineage or high rank, as he believed, for he regarded the\ncharioteer of Anga as his sire.\n\nDuryodhana, perceiving his discomfiture, cried out to Kripa, saying: "Valour\nis not reckoned by birth but by deeds. Karna hath already shown himself to be\nthe peer of princes. I now proclaim him the Rajah of Anga."\n\nHaving spoken thus, the elder of the Kauravas led Karna by the hand and placed\nhim upon a throne, and the red umbrella was held above his head. Brahmans\nchanted the texts for the ceremony and anointed Karna as a king. Then the fan\nwas waved and the royal umbrella raised on high, while the Kauravas shouted:\n"The rajah is crowned; blessings on the rajah; honour to the valorous\nwarrior!"\n\nRobed in royal attire, Karna then spake to Duryodhana and said: "With generous\nheart thou hast conferred upon\n\np. 193\n\nme a kingdom. O prince, speak and say what service thou wouldst have me to\nrender unto thee."\n\nSaid Duryodhana: "But one boon do I ask of thee, O king. Be my comrade and, O\nvaliant warrior, be my helper also."\n\nKarna said: "As thou desirest, so be it."\n\nThen Duryodhana and Karna embraced one another to confirm their loyal\nfriendship.\n\nLo! now a charioteer drew nigh; he was a scantily-clad and wearied old man,\nand he stooped, leaning heavily upon his staff. He was the aged sire of Karna,\nand rejoiced in his heart to see his son so highly honoured among princes.\nKarna cast aside his weapons, knelt down, and kissed the old man\'s feet. The\nhappy sire embraced the crowned head of the warrior and wept tears of love.\n\nThe Pandava brothers gazed upon father and son, amused and scornful. . . .\nBhima spake to Karna, saying: "So thou, with such a sire, hast presumed to\nseek combat with a Pandava! . . . Son of a charioteer, what hast thou to do\nwith weapons of war? Better were it that thou shouldst find thee a goad and\ndrive a bullock-cart behind thy sire."\n\nKarna grew pale with wrath; his lips quivered, but he answered not a word. He\nheaved a deep sigh and looked towards the sun.\n\nThen Duryodhana arose like a proud elephant and spake to Bhima, saying: "Seek\nnot with insults to give sorrow unto a mighty hero. Taunts come ill from thee,\nthou tiger-like chief. The proudest warrior may contend against the most\nhumble: a hero is known by his deeds. Of Karna\'s birth we care naught. Hath\nDrona other than humble lineage? \'Tis, said, too, that thou and thy brethren\nare not sons of Pandu, but of certain amorous\n\np. 194\n\ndeities. . . . Look upon Karna, adorned with jewels and in golden armour! Do\nhinds bring forth tigers? . . . Karna was born to he a king; he hath come to\nrule by reason of his valour and his worth. If any prince or warrior among you\nwill deny my words, hear and know, now, that I will meet him in deadly\ncombat."\n\nThe assembled multitude heard these mighty words with joy and shouted loud\napplause.\n\nBut darkness came on, and lamps were lit upon the plain. . . . Drona and the\nsons of Pandu made offerings at the altar, and the king and his counsellors,\nthe noble dames and the high-born maids, departed in silence to their homes. .\n. . Then all the people deserted the harriers, some shouting, "Arjuna hath\ntriumphed;" others, "Karna is victor;" and some also, "Duryodhana hath won."\n\nPritha had rejoiced in her heart to behold her noble son crowned king. . . .\n\nDuryodhana walked by Karna\'s side and took him away to his own palace, glad of\nheart, for he no longer feared Arjuna\'s valour and skill at arms.\n\nEven Yudhishthira doubted Arjuna\'s worth; he feared that Karna was the\ngreatest hero in the world of men.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[187:1](iml16.htm#fr_230) Like the Parthians, the ancient Hindus were expert\narchers on horseback.\n\n[188:1](iml16.htm#fr_231) This is a notable example of the characteristic\nexaggerations of late Brahmanical compilers.
