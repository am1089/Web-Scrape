He was poor and foolish and in evil case for want of employment,\nand he had very many children, that he might reap the fruit of his misdeeds in\na former life.\n\nHe wandered about begging with his family, and at last he reached a certain\ncity, and entered the service of a rich householder called Sthuladatta. His\nsons became keepers of Sthuladatta\'s cows and other property, and his wife a\nservant to him, and he himself lived near his house, performing the duty of an\nattendant. One day there was a feast on account of the marriage of the\ndaughter of Sthuladatta, largely attended by many friends of the bridegroom,\nand merry-makers. Harisarman hoped that he would be able to fill himself up to\nthe throat with ghee and flesh and other dainties, and get the same for his\nfamily, in the house of his patron. While he was anxiously expecting to be\nfed, no one thought of him.\n\nThen he was distressed at getting nothing to eat, and he said to his wife at\nnight, "It is owing to my poverty and stupidity that I am treated with such\ndisrespect here; so I will pretend by means of an artifice to possess a\nknowledge of magic, so that I may become an object of respect to this\nSthuladatta; so, when you get an opportunity, tell him that I possess magical\nknowledge." He said this to her, and after turning the matter over in his\nmind, while people were asleep he took away from the house of Sthuladatta a\nhorse on which his master\'s son-in-law rode. He placed it in concealment at\nsome distance, and in the morning the friends of the bridegroom could not find\nthe horse, though they searched in every direction. Then, while Sthuladatta\nwas distressed at the evil omen, and searching, for the thieves who had\ncarried off the horse, the wife of Harisarman came and said to him, "My\nhusband is a wise man, skilled in astrology and magical sciences; he can get\nthe horse back for you; why do you not ask him?" When Sthuladatta heard that,\nhe called Harisarman, who said, "Yesterday I was forgotten, but to-day, now\nthe horse is stolen, I am called to mind," and Sthuladatta then propitiated\nthe Brahman with these words--" I forgot you, forgive me "--and asked him to\ntell him who had taken away their horse. Then Harisarman drew all kinds of\npretended diagrams, and said: "The horse has been placed by thieves on the\nboundary line south from this place. It is concealed there, and before it is\ncarried off to a distance, as it will be at close of day, go quickly and bring\nit." When they heard that, many men ran and brought the horse quickly,\npraising the discernment of Harisarman. Then Harisarman was honoured by all\nmen as a sage, and dwelt there in happiness, honoured by Sthuladatta.\n\nNow, as days went on, much treasure, both of gold and jewels, had been stolen\nby a thief from the palace of the king. As the thief was not known, the king\nquickly summoned Harisarman on account of his reputation for knowledge of\nmagic. And he, when summoned, tried to gain time, and said, "I will tell you\nto-morrow," and then he was placed in a chamber by the king, and carefully\nguarded. And he was sad because he had pretended to have knowledge. Now in\nthat palace there was a maid named Jihva (which means Tongue), who, with the\nassistance of her brother, had stolen that treasure from the interior of the\npalace. She, being alarmed at Harisarman\'s knowledge, went at night and\napplied her ear to the door of that chamber in order to find out what he was\nabout. And Harisarman, who was alone inside, was at that very moment blaming\nhis own tongue, that had made a vain assumption of knowledge. He said: "O\nTongue, what is this that you have done through your greediness? Wicked one,\nyou will soon receive punishment in full." When Jihva heard this, she thought,\nin her terror, that she had been discovered by this wise man, and she managed\nto get in where he was, and falling at his feet, she said to the supposed\nwizard:\n\n"Brahman, here I am, that Jihva whom you have discovered to be the thief of\nthe treasure, and after I took it I buried it in the earth in a garden behind\nthe palace, under a pomegranate tree. So spare me, and receive the small\nquantity of gold which is in my possession."\n\nWhen Harisarman heard that, he said to her proudly:\n\n"Depart, I know all this; I know the past, present and future; but I will not\ndenounce you, being a miserable creature that has implored my protection. But\nwhatever gold is in your possession you must give back to me." When he said\nthis to the maid, she consented, and departed quickly. But Harisarman\nreflected in his astonishment: "Fate brings about, as if in sport, things\nimpossible, for when calamity was so near, who would have thought chance would\nhave brought us success? While I was blaming my jihva, the thief Jihva\nsuddenly flung herself at my feet. Secret crimes manifest themselves by means\nof fear." Thus thinking, he passed the night happily in the chamber. And in\nthe morning he brought the king, by some skilful parade of pretended knowledge\ninto the garden, and led him up to the treasure, which was buried under the\npomegranate free, and said that the thief had escaped with a part of it. Then\nthe king was pleased, and gave him the revenue of many villages.\n\nBut the minister, named Devajnanin, whispered in the king\'s ear: "How can a\nman possess such knowledge unattainable by men, without having studied the\nbooks of magic; you may be certain that this is a specimen of the way he makes\na dishonest livelihood, by having a secret intelligence with thieves. It will\nbe much better to test him by some new artifice." Then the king of his own\naccord brought a covered pitcher into which he had thrown a frog, and said to\nHarisarman, "Brahman, if you can guess what there is in this pitcher, I will\ndo you great honour to-day." When the Brahman Harisarman heard that, he\nthought that his last hour had come, and he called to mind the pet name of\n"Froggie" which his father had given him in his childhood in sport, and,\nimpelled by luck, he called to himself by his pet name, lamenting his hard\nfate, and suddenly called out: "This is a fine pitcher for you, Froggie; it\nwill soon become the swift destroyer of your helpless self." The people there,\nwhen they heard him say that, raised a shout of applause, because his speech\nchimed in so well with the object presented to him, and murmured, "Ah! a great\nsage, be knows even about the frog!" Then the king, thinking that this was all\ndue to knowledge of divination, was highly delighted, and gave Harisarman the\nrevenue of more villages, with gold, an umbrella, and state carriages of all\nkinds. So Harisarman prospered in the world.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Charmed Ring](ift13.htm)\n\n'
