He now digs it (the lump of clay) 1 up from that (hole);--for the\ngods, having found him (Agni), then dug him up; and in like manner this one,\nafter finding him, now digs him up,--with (Va _g_. S. XI, 28), 'At the impulse\nof the god Savit _ri_ , by the arms of the A _s_ vins, by the hands of Pushan,\nI dig thee, the Agni Purishya, from the lap of the earth, A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like;'--\nimpelled by Savit _ri_ , he thus, by means of those deities, digs him up, the\nAgni favourable to cattle, as Agni (did).\n\n6:4:1:22\\. 'Thee, O Agni, the bright, the fair-faced,'--for this Agni is\nindeed bright and fair-faced;--'glowing with perpetual sheen,'--that is,\n'shining with perpetual light;'--'thee, kind to creatures, and never harming,\nthe Agni Purishya we dig up from the lap of the earth, A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like;'--that\nis, thee, kind to creatures, and never harming, the cattle-loving Agni we dig\nup from the lap of the earth, as Agni (did).'\n\n6:4:1:33\\. With two (formulas) he digs,--two-footed is the Sacrificer, and the\nSacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so\nmuch he thus digs him up. And twofold also is that form of his, (consisting as\nit does of) clay and water.\n\n6:4:1:44\\. He digs, with, 'I dig,'--'we dig;' for with, 'I\n\np. 215\n\ndig,' Pra _g_ apati dug for him (Agni); and with, 'we dig,' the gods dug for\nhim, therefore (he digs), with, 'I dig,'--'we dig.'\n\n6:4:1:55\\. Now while digging with the spade, he says with speech 'I dig,' 'we\ndig,' for the spade is speech. It is for his undertaking that this bamboo\n(spade) is made; and with speech for a spade, the gods dug him up; and in like\nmanner does this one now dig him up with speech for a spade (or, with the\nspeech-spade).\n\n6:4:1:66\\. He then deposits it upon the black antelope skin, for the black\nantelope skin is the sacrifice 1: in the sacrifice he thus deposits it (or\nhim, Agni);--on the hair (side); for the hair is the metres: he thus deposits\nhim on the metres. That (skin) he spreads silently; for the black antelope\nskin is the sacrifice; and the sacrifice is Pra _g_ apati, and undefined is\nPra _g_ apati. North (of the hole he spreads it),--the meaning of this (will\nbe explained) hereafter;--on (the skin spread) with the neck-part in front,\nfor thus (it is turned) towards the gods.\n\n6:4:1:77\\. And he deposits it on a lotus-leaf (placed on the skin); for the\nlotus-leaf is the womb, and into the womb he pours that seed; and the seed\nwhich is poured into the womb, becomes generative. He spreads that (leaf) with\na formula; for the formula is speech, and the lotus-leaf is speech 2.\n\n6:4:1:88\\. [Va _g_. S. XI, 29] 'Thou art the waters'\n\np. 216\n\nback, Agni's womb,' for this is indeed the back of the waters, and the womb of\nAgni;--'around the swelling sea,'--for the sea indeed swells around\nit;--'thou, growing mighty upon the lotus,'--that is, 'growing, prosper thou\non the lotus.'--'With the measure of the sky, extend thou in width!'--with\nthis he strokes along it (so as to lie even on the skin); for that Agni is\nyonder sun; and him assuredly none other than the width of the sky can\ncontain: 'having become the sky, contain him!' this is what he thereby says.\n\n6:4:1:99\\. He spreads it over the black antelope skin; for the black antelope\nskin is the sacrifice; and the black antelope skin is this earth, and the\nsacrifice is this earth, for on this earth the sacrifice is spread. And the\nlotus-leaf is the sky; for the sky is the waters, and the lotus-leaf is the\nwaters; and yonder sky is above this earth.\n\n6:4:1:1010\\. He touches both of them--he thereby brings about concord between\nthem--with (Va _g_. S. XI, 30), 'A shelter ye are, a shield ye are!'--for both\na shelter and a shield these two indeed are;--'uninjured both, and ample,'--\nfor uninjured and ample both these indeed are;--'capacious, guard ye,'--that\nis, 'spacious, guard ye!'--'bear ye Agni Purishya!'--that is, 'bear ye Agni,\nfavourable to cattle 1!'\n\n6:4:1:1111\\. [Va _g_. S. XI, 31] 'Guard ye, light-finders, uniting with each\nother, with the breast, with the self,'--that is, 'guard him, ye light-\nfinders, uniting with each other, both with your breast and your\nself;'--'bearing within the brilliant, the\n\np. 217\n\neverlasting;'--this Agni indeed is yonder sun, and he is the brilliant, the\neverlasting one; and him these two bear between (them): hence he says, the\nbrilliant, the everlasting.'\n\n6:4:1:1212\\. He touches them with two (verses);--two-footed is the Sacrificer,\nand the Sacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure,\nby so much he thus brings about concord between these two. And, again, (he\ndoes so) because that form of theirs is twofold, (there being) a black\nantelope skin and a lotus-leaf.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[214:1](sbe4137.htm#fr_437) Or him, Agni; the identity of the two being kept\nup throughout.\n\n[215:1](sbe4137.htm#fr_438) Regarding the skin of the black antelope,\nconsidered as a symbol of Brahmanical worship and civilisation, see part i, p.\n23, note 2.
