And on account of that which is posterior (i. e. the effect) being that\nwhich is.\n\nFor the following reason also the effect is to be considered as non-different\n(from the cause). That which is posterior in time, i.e. the effect, is\ndeclared by Scripture to have, previous to its actual beginning, its Being in\nthe cause, by the Self of the cause merely. For in passages like,' In the\nbeginning, my dear, this was that only which is' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 2, 3); and,\n'Verily, in the beginning this was Self, one only' (Ait. \xc3\x82r. II, 4, i, i), the\neffect which is denoted by the word 'this' appears in grammatical co-\nordination with (the word denoting) the cause (from which it appears that both\ninhere in the same substratum). A thing, on the other hand, which does not\nexist in another thing by the Self of the latter is not produced from that\nother thing; for instance, oil is not produced from sand. Hence as there is\nnon-difference before the production (of the effect), we understand that the\neffect even after having been produced continues to be non-different from the\ncause. As the cause, i e. Brahman, is in all time neither more nor less than\nthat which is, so the effect also, viz. the world, is in all time only that\nwhich is. But that which is is one only; therefore the effect is non-different\nfrom the cause.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1, 17](sbe34156.htm)\n\n"
