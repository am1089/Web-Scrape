And on account of (Scripture) separating (the akshara) from that whose\nnature is different (from Brahman).\n\nAlso on account of the reason stated in this Sutra Brahman only is to be\nconsidered as the Imperishable, and the supporting of all things up to ether\nis to be looked upon as the work of Brahman only, not of anything else. The\nmeaning of the Sutra is as follows. Whatever things other than Brahman might\npossibly be thought to be denoted by the term 'akshara,' from the nature of\nall those things Scripture separates the akshara spoken of as the\n\np. 171\n\nsupport of all things up to ether. The scriptural passage alluded to is III,\n8, 11, 'That akshara, O Gargi, is unseen but seeing, unheard but hearing,\nunperceived but perceiving, unknown but knowing.' Here the designation of\nbeing unseen, &c. agrees indeed with the pradhana also, but not so the\ndesignation of seeing, &c., as the pradhana is non-intelligent.--Nor can the\nword akshara denote the embodied soul with its limiting conditions, for the\npassage following on the one quoted declares that there is nothing different\nfrom the Self ('there is nothing that sees but it, nothing that hears but it,\nnothing that perceives but it, nothing that knows but it'); and, moreover,\nlimiting conditions are expressly denied (of the akshara) in the passage, 'It\nis without eyes, without ears, without speech, without mind,' &c. (III, 8, 8).\nAn embodied soul without limiting conditions does not exist 1.--It is\ntherefore certain beyond doubt that the Imperishable is nothing else but the\nhighest Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[171:1](sbe34081.htm#fr_178) A remark directed against the possible attempt to\nexplain the passage last quoted as referring to the embodied soul.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 13](sbe34082.htm)\n\n"
