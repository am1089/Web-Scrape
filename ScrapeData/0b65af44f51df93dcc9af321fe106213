Address thy song [1](sbe46129.htm#an_5:25:1:1) for your sake to the god\nAgni, for his help. He is our Vasu. May the son of the dawns(?)\n[2](sbe46129.htm#an_5:25:1:2) give us (wealth). May the righteous one help us\nacross our enemies.\n\n2\\. He is the true one, whom the men of old, whom the gods have kindled, the\nHot _ri_ with the delightful tongue, rich in splendour with glorious shine.\n\n3\\. As such, with thy widest thought and with thy best favour, shine wealth on\nus, excellent Agni, for our beautiful praises [1](sbe46129.htm#an_5:25:3:1).\n\n\n\n4\\. Agni reigns among the gods, Agni among mortals, entering among them. Agni\nis the carrier of our offerings. Serve ye Agni with prayers!\n\n5\\. Agni gives to the worshipper a son most mightily renowned, a knower of\nmighty spells, most excellent, unconquered, who brings renown to his lord\n[1](sbe46129.htm#an_5:25:5:1).\n\n6\\. Agni gives a good lord who is victorious in battles with his men; Agni\n(gives) a steed, swiftly running, victorious (in races), unconquered.\n\n\n\n7\\. Sing mightily to Agni the (song) which may best bring him (to us), O (god)\nrich in splendour [1](sbe46129.htm#an_5:25:7:1)! From thee (proceeds) wealth\n(mighty) like a buffalo-cow [2](sbe46129.htm#an_5:25:7:2); from thee proceed\ngains.\n\n8\\. Thy brilliant flames resound mightily like the pressing-stone (of the\nSoma) [1](sbe46129.htm#an_5:25:8:1). And thy roaring arose like thunder by\nitself from heaven [2](sbe46129.htm#an_5:25:8:2).\n\np. 417\n\n9\\. Thus we have paid homage, desirous of goods, to powerful Agni. May he, the\nhighly wise one, help us, as with a ship, across all enemies.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe _Ri_ shis are the Vasuyava _h_ \xc3\x82treya _h_ (cf. verse 9); the metre is\nAnush _t_ ubh.
