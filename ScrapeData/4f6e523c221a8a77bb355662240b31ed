I am busy." And yet I really ought to be\nseeking invitations from a stranger. Oh, what a wretched state of affairs!\nWhen good Ch\xc4\x81rudatta was still wealthy, I used to eat my fill of the most\ndeliciously fragrant sweetmeats, prepared day and night with the greatest of\ncare. I would sit at the door of the courtyard, where I was surrounded by\nhundreds of dishes, and there, like a painter with his paint-boxes, I would\nsimply touch them with my fingers and thrust them aside. I would stand chewing\nmy cud like a bull in the city market. And now he is so poor that I have to\nrun here, there, and everywhere, and come home, like the pigeons, only to\nroost. Now here is this jasmine-scented cloak, which Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\'s good friend\nJ\xc5\xabrnavriddha has sent him. He bade me give it to Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, as soon as he had\nfinished his devotions. So now I will look for Ch\xc4\x81rudatta. [ _He walks about\nand looks around him_.] Ch\xc4\x81rudatta has finished his devotions, and here he\ncomes with an offering for the divinities of the house.\n\n[ _Enter Ch \xc4\x81rudatta as described, and Radanik\xc4\x81_.]\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Looking up and sighing wearily_.]\n\nUpon my threshold, where the offering  \n  Was straightway seized by swans and flocking cranes,  \nThe grass grows now, and these poor seeds I fling  \n  Fall where the mouth of worms their sweetness stains.9\n\n[ _He walks about very slowly and seats himself_.]\n\n_Maitreya_. Ch\xc4\x81rudatta is here. I must go and speak to him. [ _Approaching_.]\nMy greetings to you. May happiness be yours.\n\np. 7\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Ah, it is my constant friend Maitreya. You are very welcome, my\nfriend. Pray be seated.\n\n_Maitreya_. Thank you. [ _He seats himself_.] Well, comrade, here is a\njasmine-scented cloak which your good friend J\xc5\xabrnavriddha has sent. He bade me\ngive it you as soon as you had finished your devotions. [ _He presents the\ncloak. Ch \xc4\x81rudatta takes it and remains sunk in thought_.] Well, what are you\nthinking about?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. My good friend,\n\nA candle shining through the deepest dark  \n  Is happiness that follows sorrow\'s strife;  \nBut after bliss when man bears sorrow\'s mark,  \n  His body lives a very death-in-life.10\n\n_Maitreya_. Well, which would you rather, be dead or be poor?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Ah, my friend,\n\nFar better death than sorrows sure and slow;  \nSome passing suffering from death may flow,  \nBut poverty brings never-ending woe.11\n\n_Maitreya_. My dear friend, be not thus cast down. Your wealth has been\nconveyed to them you love, and like the moon, after she has yielded her nectar\nto the gods, your waning fortunes win an added charm.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Comrade, I do not grieve for my ruined fortunes. But\n\n This is my sorrow. They whom I  \n Would greet as guests, now pass me by.  \n"This is a poor man\'s house," they cry.\n\n As flitting bees, the season o\xc2\x92er,  \n Desert the elephant, whose store  \n Of ichor 1 spent, attracts no more.12\n\n_Maitreya_. Oh, confound the money! It is a trifle not worth thinking about.\nIt is like a cattle-boy in the woods afraid of wasps; it doesn\'t stay anywhere\nwhere it is used for food.\n\np. 8\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rud_. Believe me, friend. My sorrow does not spring\n\n  From simple loss of gold;  \nFor fortune is a fickle, changing thing,  \n  Whose favors do not hold;  \nBut he whose sometime wealth has taken wing,  \n  Finds bosom-friends grow cold.13\n\nThen too:\n\nA poor man is a man ashamed; from shame  \nSprings want of dignity and worthy fame;  \nSuch want gives rise to insults hard to bear;  \nThence comes despondency; and thence, despair;  \nDespair breeds folly; death is folly\'s fruit.\xc2\x97  \nAh! the lack of money is all evil\'s root!14\n\n_Maitreya_. But just remember what a trifle money is, after all, and be more\ncheerful.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. My friend, the poverty of a man is to him\n\nA home of cares, a shame that haunts the mind,  \nAnother form of warfare with mankind;  \nThe abhorrence of his friends, a source of hate  \nFrom strangers, and from each once-loving mate;  \nBut if his wife despise him, then \'t were meet  \nIn some lone wood to seek a safe retreat.  \nThe flame of sorrow, torturing his soul,  \nBurns fiercely, yet contrives to leave him whole.15\n\nComrade, I have made my offering to the divinities of the house. Do you too go\nand offer sacrifice to the Divine Mothers at a place where four roads meet.\n\n_Maitreya_. No!\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Why not?\n\n_Maitreya_. Because the gods are not gracious to you even when thus honored.\nSo what is the use of worshiping?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Not so, my friend, not so! This is the constant duty of a\nhouseholder.\n\np. 9\n\nThe gods feel ever glad content  \nIn the gifts, and the self-chastisement,  \nThe meditations, and the prayers,  \nOf those who banish worldly cares.16\n\nWhy then do you hesitate? Go and offer sacrifice to the Mothers.\n\n_Maitreya_. No, I\'m not going. You must send somebody else. Anyway, everything\nseems to go wrong with me, poor Brahman that I am! It\'s like a reflection in a\nmirror; the right side becomes the left, and the left becomes the right.\nBesides, at this hour of the evening, people are abroad upon the king\'s\nhighway\xc2\x97courtezans, courtiers, servants, and royal favorites. They will take\nme now for fair prey, just as the black-snake out frog-hunting snaps up the\nmouse in his path. But what will you do sitting here?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Good then, remain; and I will finish my devotions.\n\n\n\n_Voices behind the scenes_. Stop, Vasantasen\xc4\x81, stop!\n\n[ _Enter Vasantasen \xc4\x81, pursued by the courtier, by Sansth\xc4\x81naka, and the\nservant_.]\n\n_Courtier_. Vasantasen\xc4\x81! Stop, stop!\n\nAh, why should fear transform your tenderness?  \nWhy should the dainty feet feel such distress,  \n  That twinkle in the dance so prettily?  \nWhy should your eyes, thus startled into fear,  \nDart sidelong looks? Why, like the timid deer  \n  Before pursuing hunters, should you flee?17\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Shtop, 1 Vasantasen\xc4\x81, shtop!\n\nWhy flee? and run? and shtumble in your turning?  \n  Be kind! You shall not die. Oh, shtop your feet!  \nWith love, shweet girl, my tortured heart is burning,  \n  As on a heap of coals a piece of meat.18\n\np. 10\n\n_Servant_. Stop, courtezan, stop!\n\n  In fear you flee  \n  Away from me,  \nAs a summer peahen should;  \n  But my lord and master  \n  Struts fast and faster,  \nLike a woodcock in the wood.19\n\nCourtier. Vasantasen\xc4\x81! Stop, stop!\n\nWhy should you tremble, should you flee,  \nA-quiver like the plantain tree?  \nYour garment\'s border, red and fair,  \nIs all a-shiver in the air;  \nNow and again, a lotus-bud  \nFalls to the ground, as red as blood.  \nA red realgar 1 vein you seem,  \nWhence, smitten, drops of crimson stream.20\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Shtop, Vasantasen\xc4\x81, shtop!\n\nYou wake my passion, my desire, my love;  \n  You drive away my shleep in bed at night;  \nBoth fear and terror sheem your heart to move;  \n  You trip and shtumble in your headlong flight.  \nBut R\xc4\x81vana forced Kunt\xc4\xab 2 to his will;  \nJusht sho shall I enjoy you to the fill.21\n\nCourtier. Ah, Vasantasen\xc4\x81,\n\nWhy should your fleeter flight  \n  Outstrip my flying feet?  \nWhy, like a snake in fright  \nBefore the bird-king\'s might,  \n  Thus seek to flee, my sweet?\n\np. 11\n\nCould I not catch the storm-wind in his flight?  \nYet would not seize upon you, though I might.22\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Lishten to me, shir!\n\nThish whip of robber Love, thish dancing-girl,  \nEater of fish, deshtroyer of her kin,  \nThish shnubnose, shtubborn, love-box, courtezan,  \nThish clothes-line, wanton creature, maid of sin\xc2\x97  \nI gave her ten shweet names, and shtill  \nShe will not bend her to my will.23\n\n_Courtier_. As courtier\'s fingers strike the lute\'s tense string,\n\nThe dancing ear-ring smites your wounded cheek.  \nWhy should you flee, with dreadful terror weak,  \nAs flees the crane when heaven\'s thunders ring?24\n\n_Sansth_. Your jingling gems, girl, clink like anything;\n\nLike Draupad\xc4\xab you flee, when R\xc4\x81ma kisshed her.  \nI\'ll sheize you quick, as once the monkey-king  \nSheized Subhadr\xc4\x81, Vishv\xc4\x81vasu\'s shweet shishter.25\n\n_Servant_. He\'s the royal protege;\n\nDo whatever he may say,  \nAnd you shall have good fish and flesh to eat.  \nFor when dogs have all the fish  \nAnd the flesh that they can wish,  \nEven carrion seems to them no longer sweet.26\n\n_Courtier_. Mistress Vasantasen\xc4\x81,\n\nThe girdle drooping low upon your hips  \nFlashes as brilliant as the shining stars;  \nThe wondrous terror of your fleeing mars  \nYour charms; for red realgar, loosened, slips  \nAs on an imaged god, from cheek and lips.27\n\n_Sansth_. We\'re chasing you with all our main and might,\n\nAs dogs a jackal when they hunt and find it;  \nBut you are quick and nimble in your flight,  \nAnd shteal my heart with all the roots that bind it.28\n\np. 12\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Pallavaka! Parabhritik\xc4\x81!\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Mashter! a man! a man!\n\n_Courtier_. Don\'t be a coward.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. M\xc4\x81dhavik\xc4\x81! M\xc4\x81dhavik\xc4\x81!\n\n_Courtier_. [ _Laughing_.] Fool! She is calling her servants.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Mashter! Is she calling a woman?\n\n_Courtier_. Why, of course.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Women! I kill hundreds of \xc2\x92em. I\'m a brave man.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _Seeing that no one answers_.] Alas, how comes it that my\nvery servants have fallen away from me? I shall have to defend myself by\nmother-wit.\n\n_Courtier_. Don\'t stop the search.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Shqueal, Vasantasen\xc4\x81, shqueal for your cuckoo Parabhritik\xc4\x81, or\nfor your blosshom Pallavaka or for all the month of May! Who\'s going to save\nyou when I\'m chasing you?\n\nWhy shpeak of Bh\xc4\xabmasena? Or the shon  \nOf Jamadagni, that thrice-mighty one?  \nThe ten-necked ogre? Shon of Kunt\xc4\xab fair?  \nJusht look at me! My fingers in your hair,  \nJusht like Duhsh\xc4\x81sana, I\'ll tear, and tear.29\n\nLook, look!\n\nMy shword is sharp; good-by, poor head!  \nLet\'s chop it off, or kill you dead.  \nThen do not try my wrath to shun;  \nWhen you musht die, your life is done.30\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Sir, I am a weak woman.\n\n_Courtier_. That is why you are still alive.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. That is why you\'re not murdered.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _Aside_.] Oh! his very courtesy frightens me. Come, I will\ntry this. [ _Aloud_.] Sir, what do you expect from this pursuit? my jewels?\n\np. 13\n\n_Courtier_. Heaven forbid! A garden creeper, mistress Vasantasen\xc4\x81, should not\nbe robbed of its blossoms. Say no more about the jewels.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. What is then your desire?\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. I\'m a man, a big man, a regular V\xc4\x81sudeva. 1 You musht love me.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _Indignantly_.] Heavens! You weary me. Come, leave me! Your\nwords are an insult.\n\nSansth\xc4\x81naka. [ _Laughing and clapping his hands_.] Look, mashter, look! The\ncourtezan\'s daughter is mighty affectionate with me, isn\'t she? Here she says\n"Come on! Heavens, you\'re weary. You\'re tired!" No, I haven\'t been walking to\nanother village or another city. No, little mishtress, I shwear by the\ngentleman\'s head, I shwear by my own feet! It\'s only by chasing about at your\nheels that I\'ve grown tired and weary.\n\nCourtier. [ _Aside_.] What! is it possible that the idiot does not understand\nwhen she says "You weary me"? [ _Aloud_.] Vasantasen\xc4\x81, your words have no\nplace in the dwelling of a courtezan,\n\nWhich, as you know, is friend to every youth;  \n  Remember, you are common as the flower  \nThat grows beside the road; in bitter truth,  \n  Your body has its price; your beauty\'s dower  \nIs his, who pays the market\'s current rate:  \nThen serve the man you love, and him you hate.31\n\nAnd again:\n\nThe wisest Brahman and the meanest fool  \nBathe in the selfsame pool;  \nBeneath the peacock, flowering plants bend low,  \nNo less beneath the crow;  \nThe Brahman, warrior, merchant, sail along  \nWith all the vulgar throng.  \nYou are the pool, the flowering plant, the boat;  \nAnd on your beauty every man may dote.32\n\np. 14\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Yet true love would be won by virtue, not violence.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. But, mashter, ever since the shlave-wench went into the park\nwhere K\xc4\x81ma\'s 1 temple shtands, she has been in love with a poor man, with\nCh\xc4\x81rudatta, and she doesn\'t love me any more. His house is to the left. Look\nout and don\'t let her shlip out of our hands.\n\n_Courtier_. [ _Aside_.] Poor fool, he has said the very thing he should have\nconcealed. So Vasantasen\xc4\x81 is in love with Ch\xc4\x81rudatta? The proverb is right.\nPearl suits with pearl. Well, I have had enough of this fool. [ _Aloud_.] Did\nyou say the good merchant\'s house was to the left, you jackass?\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Yes. His house is to the left.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _Aside_.] Oh, wonderful! If his house is really at my left\nhand, then the scoundrel has helped me in the very act of hurting me, for he\nhas guided me to my love.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. But mashter, it\'s pitch dark and it\'s like hunting for a grain\nof soot in a pile of shpotted beans. Now you shee Vasantasen\xc4\x81 and now you\ndon\'t.\n\n_Courtier_. Pitch dark it is indeed.\n\nThe sudden darkness seems to steal  \n  The keenness of my sight;  \nMy open eyes, as with a seal,  \n  Are closed by blackest night.33\n\nAnd again:\n\nDarkness anoints my body, and the sky  \nDrops ointment of thick darkness, till mine eye  \n  Is all unprofitable grown to me,  \nLike service done to them who cheat and lie.34\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Mashter, I\'m looking for Vasantasen\xc4\x81.\n\n_Courtier_. Is there anything you can trace her by, jackass?\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Like what, for inshtance?\n\np. 15\n\n_Courtier_. Like the tinkling of her jewels, for instance, or the fragrance of\nher garlands.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. I hear the shmell of her garlands, but my nose is shtuffed so\nfull of darkness that I don\'t shee the shound of her jewels very clearly.\n\n_Courtier_. [ _To Vasantasen \xc4\x81. Aside_.] Vasantasen\xc4\x81,\n\n\xc2\x92Tis true, the night is dark, O timid maid,  \n  And like the lightning hidden in the cloud,  \nYou are not seen; yet you will be betrayed  \n  By fragrant garlands and by anklets loud.35\n\nHave you heard me, Vasantasen\xc4\x81?\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _To herself_.] Heard and understood. [ _She removes the\nankle-rings, lays aside the garlands, and takes a few steps, feeling her\nway_.] I can feel the wall of the house, and here is a side-entrance. But\nalas! my fingers tell me that the door is shut.\n\n\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_ [ _who is within the house_ ]. Comrade, my prayer is done. Go\nnow and offer sacrifice to the Mothers.\n\nMaitreya. No, I\'m not going.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Alas!\n\nThe poor man\'s kinsmen do not heed his will;  \n  The friends who loved him once, now stand afar;  \nHis sorrows multiply; his strength is nil;  \n  Behold! his character\'s bright-shining star  \nFades like the waning moon; and deeds of ill  \nThat others do, are counted to him still.36\n\nAnd again:\n\nNo man holds converse with him; none will greet  \nWith due respect the poor man when they meet.  \nWhere rich men hold a feast, if he draw near,  \nHe meets with scornful looks for looks of cheer. p. 16\n\nWhere vulgar throngs are gathered, \xc2\x92tis the same;  \nHis scanty raiment wakes his heartfelt shame.  \nFive are the deadly sins 1 we knew before;  \nAlas! I find the sixth is\xc2\x97to be poor.37\n\nAnd yet again:\n\nAh, Poverty, I pity thee, that so  \nTo me thou clingest, as thy dearest friend;  \nWhen my poor life has met its woeful end,  \nI sadly wonder, whither thou wilt go.38\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Betraying his embarrassment_.] Well, comrade, if I must go, at\nleast let Radanik\xc4\x81 go with me, to keep me company.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Radanik\xc4\x81, you are to accompany Maitreya.\n\n_Radanik \xc4\x81_. Yes, sir.\n\n_Maitreya_. Mistress Radanik\xc4\x81, do you take the offering and the candle while I\nopen the side-door. [ _He does so_.]\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. It seems as if the door took pity on me and opened of itself.\nI will lose no time, but enter. [ _She looks in_.] What? a candle? Oh dear, oh\ndear! [ _She puts it out with her skirt and enters_.]\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. What was that, Maitreya?\n\n_Maitreya_. I opened the side-door and the wind came through all in a lump and\nblew out the candle. Suppose you go out by the side-door, Radanik\xc4\x81, and I will\nfollow as soon as I have gone into the courtyard and lighted the candle again.\n\n[ _Exit_.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Mashter! mashter! I\'m looking for Vasantasen\xc4\x81.\n\n_Courtier_. Keep on looking, keep on looking!\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Does so_.] Mashter! mashter! I\'ve caught her! I\'ve caught\nher!\n\n_Courtier_. Idiot, you\'ve caught me.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. You shtand right here, mashter, and shtay where you\'re put. [\n_He renews the search and seizes the servant_.] Mashter!\n\np. 17\n\nmashter! I\'ve caught her! I\'ve caught her!\n\n_Servant_. Master, you\'ve caught me, your servant.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Mashter here, shervant here! Mashter, shervant; shervant,\nmashter. Now shtay where you\'re put, both of you. [ _He renews the search and\nseizes Radanik \xc4\x81 by the hair_.] Mashter! mashter! Thish time I\'ve caught her!\nI\'ve caught Vasantasen\xc4\x81!\n\nThrough the black night she fled, fled she;  \n  Her garland\'s shmell betrayed her;  \nLike Ch\xc4\x81nakya caught Draupad\xc4\xab,  \n  I caught her hair and shtayed her.39\n\n_Courtier_. Ah, proud to be so young, so fair!\n\n  Too high thy love must not aspire;  \nFor now thy blossom-fragrant hair,  \nThat merits richest gems and rare,  \n  Serves but to drag thee through the mire.40\n\n_Sansth_. I\'ve got your head, girl, got it tight,\n\n  By the hair, the locks, and the curls, too.  \nNow shcream, shqueak, shqueal with all your might  \n  "Shiva! Ishvara! Shankara! Shambhu!" 141\n\n_Radanik \xc4\x81_. [ _In terror_.] Oh, sirs, what does this mean?\n\n_Courtier_. You jackass! It\'s another voice.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Mashter, the wench has changed her voice, the way a cat\nchanges her voice, when she wants shome cream of curdled milk.\n\n_Courtier_. Changed her voice? Strange! Yet why so strange?\n\nShe trod the stage; she learned the arts;  \nShe studied to deceive our hearts;  \nAnd now she practises her parts.42\n\n[ _Enter Maitreya_.]\n\n_Maitreya_. Look! In the gentle evening breeze the flame of the candle is\nfluttering like the heart of a goat that goes to the altar. [ _He approaches\nand discovers Radanik \xc4\x81_.] Mistress Radanik\xc4\x81!\n\np. 18\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Mashter, mashter! A man! a man!\n\n_Maitreya_. This is right, this is perfectly right, that strangers should\nforce their way into the house, just because Ch\xc4\x81rudatta is poor.\n\n_Radanik \xc4\x81_. Oh, Maitreya, see how they insult me.\n\n_Maitreya_. What! insult you? No, they are insulting us.\n\n_Radanik \xc4\x81_. Very well. They are insulting you, then.\n\n_Maitreya_. But they aren\'t using violence?\n\n_Radanik \xc4\x81_. Yes, yes!\n\n_Maitreya_. Really?\n\n_Radanik \xc4\x81_. Really.\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Raising his staff angrily_.] No, sir! Man, a dog will show his\nteeth in his own kennel, and I am a Brahman! My staff is crooked as my\nfortunes, but it can still split a dry bamboo or a rascal\'s pate.\n\n_Courtier_. Have mercy, O great Brahman, have mercy.\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Discovers the courtier_.] He is not the sinner. [ _Discovers\nSansth \xc4\x81naka_.] Ah, here is the sinner. Well, you brother-in-law to the king,\nSansth\xc4\x81naka, you scoundrel, you coward, this is perfectly proper, isn\'t it?\nCh\xc4\x81rudatta the good is a poor man now\xc2\x97true, but are not his virtues an\nornament to Ujjayin\xc4\xab? And so men break into his house and insult his servants!\n\nInsult not him, laid low by poverty;  \nFor none are counted poor by mighty fate:  \nYet he who falls from virtue\'s high estate,  \nThough he be rich, no man is poor as he.43\n\n_Courtier_. [ _Betraying his embarrassment_.] Have mercy, O great Brahman,\nhave mercy. We intended no insolence; we merely mistook this lady for another.\nFor\n\nWe sought an amorous maiden,\n\n_Maitreya_. What! this one?\n\n_Courtier_. Heaven forbid!\n\n                               one whose youth  \nIs in the guidance of her own sweet will; p. 19  \nShe disappeared; unconscious of the truth,  \n  We did what seems a purposed deed of ill.44\n\nI pray you, accept this all-in-all of humblest supplication. [ _He drops his\nsword, folds his hands, and falls at Maitreya\'s feet_.]\n\n_Maitreya_. Good man, rise, rise. When I reviled you, I did not know you. Now\nI know you and I ask your pardon.\n\n_Courtier_. It is I who should ask pardon. I will rise on one condition.\n\n_Maitreya_. And that is\xc2\x97\n\n_Courtier_. That you will not tell Ch\xc4\x81rudatta what has happened here.\n\n_Maitreya_. I will be silent.\n\n_Courtier_. Brahman, this gracious act of thine\n\n  I bow my neck to bear;  \nFor never could this sword of mine  \n  With virtue\'s steel compare.45\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Indignantly_.] But mashter, what makes you fold your hands\nsho helplesshly and fall at the feet of thish manikin?\n\n_Courtier_. I was afraid.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. What were _you_ afraid of?\n\n_Courtier_. Of Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\'s virtues.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Virtues? He? You can go into his houshe and not find a thing\nto eat.\n\n_Courtier_. No, no.\n\nHis loving-kindness unto such as we  \n  Has brought him low at last;  \nFrom him could no man learn what insults be,  \n  Or e\xc2\x92er his wealth was past.  \nThis well-filled pool, that in its summer day  \nGave others drink, itself is dried away.46\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Impatiently_.] Who is the shon of a shlave-wench anyway?\n\nBrave Shvetaketu is he, P\xc4\x81ndu\'s child?  \nOr R\xc4\x81dh\xc4\x81\'s shon, the ten-necked ogre wild? p. 20  \nOr Indradatta? or again, is he  \nShon of brave R\xc4\x81ma and of fair Kunt\xc4\xab?  \nOr Dharmaputra? Ashvatth\xc4\x81man bold?  \nPerhaps Jat\xc4\x81yu\'s shelf, that vulture old?47\n\n_Courtier_. Fool! I will tell you who Ch\xc4\x81rudatta is.\n\nA tree of life to them whose sorrows grow,  \nBeneath its fruit of virtue bending low;  \nFather to good men; virtue\'s touchstone he;  \nThe mirror of the learned; and the sea  \nWhere all the tides of character unite;  \nA righteous man, whom pride could never blight;  \nA treasure-house, with human virtues stored;  \nCourtesy\'s essence, honor\'s precious hoard.  \nHe doth to life its fullest meaning give,  \nSo good is he; we others breathe, not live.48!\n\nLet us be gone.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Without Vasantasen\xc4\x81?\n\n_Courtier_. Vasantasen\xc4\x81 has disappeared.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. How?\n\n_Courtier_. Like sick men\'s strength, or like the blind man\'s sight,\n\nLike the fool\'s judgment, like the sluggard\'s might,  \nLike thoughtless scoundrels\' store of wisdom\'s light,  \nLike love, when foemen fan our slumbering wrath,  \nSo did she vanish, when you crossed her path.49\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. I\'m not going without Vasantasen\xc4\x81.\n\n_Courtier_. And did you never hear this?\n\nTo hold a horse, you need a rein;  \nTo hold an elephant, a chain;  \nTo hold a woman, use a heart;  \nAnd if you haven\'t one, depart.50\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. If you\'re going, go along. I\'m not going.\n\n_Courtier_. Very well. I will go.\n\n[ _Exit_.\n\np. 21\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Mashter\'s gone, sure enough. [ _To Maitreya_.] Well, you man\nwith the head that looks like a caret, you manikin, take a sheat, take a\nsheat.\n\n_Maitreya_. We have already been invited to take a seat.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. By whom?\n\n_Maitreya_. By destiny.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Shtand up, then, shtand up!\n\n_Maitreya_. We shall.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. When?\n\n_Maitreya_. When fate is kind again.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Weep, then, weep!\n\n_Maitreya_. We have wept.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Who made you?\n\n_Maitreya_. Poverty.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Laugh, then, laugh!\n\n_Maitreya_. Laugh we shall.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. When?\n\n_Maitreya_. When Ch\xc4\x81rudatta is happy once more.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. You manikin, give poor little Ch\xc4\x81rudatta thish messhage from\nme. "Thish wench with golden ornaments and golden jewels, thish female shtage-\nmanager looking after the rehearsal of a new play, thish Vasantasen\xc4\x81\xc2\x97she has\nbeen in love with you ever shince she went into the park where K\xc4\x81ma\'s temple\nshtands. And when we tried to conciliate her by force, she went into your\nhoushe. Now if you shend her away yourshelf and hand her over to me, if you\nreshtore her at once, without any lawshuit in court, then I\'ll be friends with\nyou forever. But if you don\'t reshtore her, there will be a fight to the\ndeath." Remember:\n\nShmear a pumpkin-shtalk with cow-dung;  \n  Keep your vegetables dried;  \nCook your rice in winter evenings; p. 22  \n  And be sure your meat is fried.  \nThen let \xc2\x92em shtand, and they will not  \nBothershomely shmell and rot.51\n\nTell it to him prettily, tell it to him craftily. Tell it to him sho that I\ncan hear it as I roosht in the dove-cote on the top of my own palace. If you\nshay it different, I\'ll chew your head like an apple caught in the crack of a\ndoor.\n\n_Maitreya_. Very well. I shall tell him.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Aside_.] Tell me, shervant. Is mashter really gone?\n\n_Servant_. Yes, sir.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Then we will go as quickly as we can.\n\n_Servant_. Then take your sword, master.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. You can keep it.\n\n_Servant_. Here it is, master. Take your sword, master.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Taking it by the wrong end_.]\n\nMy shword, red as a radish shkin,  \nNe\xc2\x92er finds the time to molder;  \nShee how it shleeps its sheath within!  \nI put it on my shoulder.  \nWhile curs and bitches yelp at me, I roam,  \nLike a hunted jackal, home.52\n\n[ _Sansth \xc4\x81naka and the servant walk about, then exeunt_.\n\n_Maitreya_. Mistress Radanik\xc4\x81, you must not tell good Ch\xc4\x81rudatta of this\noutrage. I am sure you would only add to the poor man\'s sorrows.\n\n_Radanik \xc4\x81_. Good Maitreya, you know Radanik\xc4\x81. Her lips are sealed.\n\n_Maitreya_. So be it.\n\n\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _To Vasantasen \xc4\x81_.] Radanik\xc4\x81, Rohasena likes the fresh air,\nbut he will be cold in the evening chill. Pray bring him into the house, and\ncover him with this mantle. [ _He gives her the mantle_.]\n\np. 23\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _To herself_.] See! He thinks I am his servant. [ _She takes\nthe mantle and perceives its perfume. Ardently to herself_.] Oh, beautiful!\nThe mantle is fragrant with jasmine. His youthful days are not wholly\nindifferent to the pleasures of the world. [ _She wraps it about her, without\nletting Ch \xc4\x81rudatta see_.]\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Come, Radanik\xc4\x81, take Rohasena and enter the heart of the house.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _To herself_.] Ah me unhappy, that have little part or lot\nin your heart!\n\nCh\xc4\x81rudatta. Come, Radanik\xc4\x81, will you not even answer? Alas!\n\nWhen man once sees that miserable day,  \nWhen fate almighty sweeps his wealth away,  \nThen ancient friendships will no longer hold,  \nThen all his former bosom-friends grow cold.53\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Drawing near to Radanik \xc4\x81_.] Sir, here is Radanik\xc4\x81.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Here is Radanik\xc4\x81? Who then is this\xc2\x97\n\nThis unknown lady, by my robe  \n  Thus clinging, desecrated,\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _To herself_.] Say rather "consecrated."\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_.\n\nUntil she seems the crescent moon,  \n  With clouds of autumn 1 mated?54\n\nBut no! I may not gaze upon another\'s wife.\n\n_Maitreya_. Oh, you need not fear that you are looking at another man\'s wife.\nThis is Vasantasen\xc4\x81, who has been in love with you ever since she saw you in\nthe garden where K\xc4\x81ma\'s temple stands.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. What! this is Vasantasen\xc4\x81? [ _Aside_.]\n\nMy love for whom\xc2\x97my fortune spent\xc2\x97  \nMy wretched self in twain has rent,  \nLike coward\'s anger, inward bent.55\n\np. 24\n\n_Maitreya_. My friend, that brother-in-law of the king says\xc2\x97\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Well?\n\n_Maitreya_. "This wench with golden ornaments and golden jewels, this female\nstage-manager looking after the rehearsal of a new play, this Vasantasen\xc4\x81\xc2\x97she\nhas been in love with you ever since she went into the park where K\xc4\x81ma\'s\ntemple stands. And when we tried to conciliate her by force, she went into\nyour house."\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _To herself_.] "Tried to conciliate me by force"\xc2\x97truly, I am\nhonored by these words.\n\n_Maitreya_. "Now if you send her away yourself and hand her over to me, if you\nrestore her at once, without any lawsuit in court, then I\'ll be friends with\nyou forever. Otherwise, there will be a fight to the death."\n\nCh\xc4\x81rudatta. [ _Contemptuously_.] He is a fool. [ _To himself_.] How is this\nmaiden worthy of the worship that we pay a goddess! For now\n\nAlthough I bade her enter, yet she seeks  \nTo spare my poverty, nor enters here;  \nThough men are known to her, yet all she speaks  \nContains no word to wound a modest ear.56\n\n[ _Aloud_.] Mistress Vasantasen\xc4\x81, I have unwittingly made myself guilty of an\noffense; for I greeted as a servant one whom I did not recognize. I bend my\nneck to ask your pardon.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. It is I who have offended by this unseemly intrusion. I bow my\nhead to seek your forgiveness.\n\n_Maitreya_. Yes, with your pretty bows you two have knocked your heads\ntogether, till they look like a couple of rice-fields. I also bow my head like\na camel colt\'s knee and beseech you both to stand up. [ _He does so, then\nrises_.]\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Very well, let us no longer trouble ourselves with conventions.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _To herself_.] What a delightfully clever hint! But it would\nhardly be proper to spend the night, considering how I\n\np. 25\n\ncame hither. Well, I will at least say this much. [ _Aloud_.] If I am to\nreceive thus much of your favor, sir, I should be glad to leave these jewels\nin your house. It was for the sake of the jewels that those scoundrels pursued\nme.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. This house is not worthy of the trust.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. You mistake, sir! It is to men that treasures are entrusted,\nnot to houses.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Maitreya, will you receive the jewels?\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. I am much indebted to you. [ _She hands him the jewels_.]\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Receiving them_.] Heaven bless you, madam.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Fool! They are only entrusted to us.\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Aside_.] Then the thieves may take them, for all I care.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. In a very short time\xc2\x97\n\n_Maitreya_. What she has entrusted to us, belongs to us.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. I shall restore them.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. I should be grateful, sir, if this gentleman would accompany\nme home.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Maitreya, pray accompany our guest.\n\n_Maitreya_. She walks as gracefully as a female swan, and you are the gay\nflamingo to accompany her. But I am only a poor Brahman, and wherever I go,\nthe people will fall upon me just as dogs will snap at a victim dragged to the\ncross-roads.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Very well. I will accompany her myself. Let the torches be\nlighted, to ensure our safety on the highway.\n\n_Maitreya_. Vardham\xc4\x81naka, light the torches.\n\n_Vardham \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Aside to Maitreya_.] What! light torches without oil?\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Aside to Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_.] These torches of ours are like\ncourtezans who despise their poor lovers. They won\'t light up unless you feed\nthem.\n\np. 26\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Enough, Maitreya! We need no torches. See, we have a lamp upon\nthe king\'s highway.\n\nAttended by her starry servants all,  \nAnd pale to see as a loving maiden\'s cheeks,  \nRises before our eyes the moon\'s bright ball,  \nWhose pure beams on the high-piled darkness fall  \nLike streaming milk that dried-up marshes seeks.57\n\n[ _His voice betraying his passion_.] Mistress Vasantasen\xc4\x81, we have reached\nyour home. Pray enter. [ _Vasantasen \xc4\x81 gazes ardently at him, then exit_.]\nComrade, Vasantasen\xc4\x81 is gone. Come, let us go home.\n\nAll creatures from the highway take their flight;  \nThe watchmen pace their rounds before our sight;  \nTo forestall treachery, is just and right,  \nFor many sins find shelter in the night.58\n\n[ _He walks about_.] And you shall guard this golden casket by night, and\nVardham\xc4\x81naka by day.\n\n_Maitreya_. Very well.\n\n[ _Exeunt ambo_.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[7:1](lcc07.htm#fr_29) During the mating season, a fragrant liquor exudes from\nthe forehead of the elephant.
