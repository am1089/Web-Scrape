In the cases of (men of) other castes, the king, after having examined\ntheir actions, may punish them even by death.\n\n2\\. And the king shall not punish on suspicion.\n\n3\\. But having carefully investigated (the case) by means of questions\n(addressed to witnesses) and even of ordeals, the king may proceed to punish.\n3\n\n4\\. A king who acts thus, gains both (this and the next) world.\n\n5\\. The road belongs to the king except if he meets a Brahma _n_ a. 5\n\np. 126\n\n6\\. But if he meets a Brahma _n_ a, the road belongs to the latter. 6\n\n7\\. All must make way for a (laden) vehicle, for a person who carries a\nburden, for a sick man, for a woman and others (such as old men and infants).\n\n8\\. And (way must be made), by the other castes, for those men who are\nsuperior by caste.\n\n9\\. For their own welfare all men must make way for fools, outcasts,\ndrunkards, and madmen.\n\n10\\. In successive births men of the lower castes are born in the next higher\none, if they have fulfilled their duties. 10\n\n11\\. In successive births men of the higher castes are born in the next lower\none, if they neglect their duties.\n\n12\\. If he has a wife who (is willing and able) to perform (her share of) the\nreligious duties and who bears sons, he shall not take a second. 12\n\n13\\. If a wife is deficient in one of these two (qualities), he shall take\nanother, (but) before he kindles the fires (of the Agnihotra). 13\n\n14\\. For a wife who assists at the kindling of the fires, becomes connected\nwith those religious rites of which that (fire-kindling) forms a part. 14\n\np. 127\n\n15\\. He shall not give his daughter to a man belonging to the same family\n(Gotra), 15\n\n16\\. Nor to one related (within six degrees) on the mother's or (the father's)\nside. 16\n\n17\\. At the wedding called Brahma, he shall give away (his daughter) for\nbearing children and performing the rites that must be performed together (by\na husband and his wife), after having enquired regarding (the bridegroom's)\nfamily, character, learning, and health, and after having given (to the bride)\nornaments according to his power. 17\n\n18\\. At the wedding called \xc3\x82rsha, the bridegroom shall present to the father\nof the bride a bull and a cow. 18\n\n19\\. At the wedding called Daiva, (the father) shall give her to an\nofficiating priest, who is performing a _S_ rauta-sacrifice. 19\n\np. 128\n\n20\\. If a maiden and a lover unite themselves through love, that is called the\nGandharva-rite. 20\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[125:3](sbe0246.htm#fr_623) **11**. See also below, II, 11, 29, 6.\n\n[125:5](sbe0246.htm#fr_624) Manu II, 139; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 117. According to\nHaradatta this Sutra is given, though the precedence among the various castes\nhas been already settled, in order to show that common Kshatriyas must make\nway for an anointed king.\n\n[126:6](sbe0246.htm#fr_625) Manu II, 138; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 117.\n\n[126:10](sbe0246.htm#fr_626) Manu X, 64, 65; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. 1, 96.\n\n[126:12](sbe0246.htm#fr_627) Manu IX, 95; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 76.\n\n[126:13](sbe0246.htm#fr_628) Manu IX, 80, 81; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 73.\n\n[126:14](sbe0246.htm#fr_629) A wife who assists at the kindling of the fires\nfor any sacrificial rite, becomes connected with that rite like any priest,\nand in that rite no other woman can take her place. Hence in the case of an\nAgnihotra, which lasts during the performer's lifetime, or at least as long as\nbe is a householder, the performer cannot take another principal wife after be\nonce has begun his sacrifice. If the wife of an Agnihotrin dies, he must marry\nagain, and also kindle his fires afresh. Manu V, 167, 168; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I 80.\n\n[127:15](sbe0246.htm#fr_630) The term Gotra corresponds to the Latin Gens. It\nmay be of two kinds, Vaidika for Brahma _n_ as and Laukika, 'worldly', for men\nof other castes. In the first case it denotes 'persons descended from the same\n_Ri_ shi;' in the second, 'persons distinguished by the same family name, or\nknown to be descended from the same ancestor.' In our days Brahma _n_ as also\nhave Laukika Gotras, which form subdivisions of the very large Vedic Gotras.\nRegarding the Vaidika Gotras, see Max Muller's History of Ancient Sanskrit\nLiterature, pp. 379-390, and particularly p. 387. Manu III, 5; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I,\n33; Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 75 seq.\n\n[127:16](sbe0246.htm#fr_631) The term yonisambandha, 'related (within six\ndegrees),' corresponds to the more common Sapi _n_ _d_ a of Manu, Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya, and others; see the definitions given below, II, 6, 15, 2. In\n\xc3\x82pastamba's terminology Sapi _n_ _d_ a has probably a more restricted sense.\nIt seems very doubtful whether Haradatta's explanation of ka, translated by\n'or,' is correct, and whether his interpolation of 'the father's' ought to be\nadmitted. Probably Sutra 15 refers to the father's side, and Sutra 16 to the\nmother's side.\n\n[127:17](sbe0246.htm#fr_632) Manu III, 27; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 58.\n\n[127:18](sbe0246.htm#fr_633) Manu III, 29; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 59.\n\n[127:19](sbe0246.htm#fr_634) Manu III, 28; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 59.\n\n[128:20](sbe0246.htm#fr_635) Manu III, 32; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 61.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na II, Pa _t_ ala 5, Kha _n_ _d_ a 12](sbe0247.htm)\n\n"
