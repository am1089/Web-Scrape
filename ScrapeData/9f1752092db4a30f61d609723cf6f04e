II, 3, 3.\n\n3. 3 Seizing, again with his left hand, a fire-brand, he should place it on the south side of the pits with (the verse), 'They who assuming (manifold) shapes' (ibid. 4).\n\n4\\. He then calls the Fathers (to his sacrifice) with (the verse), 'Come\nhither, ye Fathers, who have drunk Soma' (ibid. 5).\n\n5\\. He then should place patra vessels of water near the pits.\n\n6. 6 Seizing, again with his left hand, (the first) vessel, he should pour it out from right to left on the Darbha grass in the eastern pit, pronouncing his father's name, 'N.N.! Wash thyself, and (may) those who follow thee here, and those whom thou followest, (wash themselves). To thee Svadha!'\n\n7. 7 After he leas touched water, (he does) the same for the other two.\n\n8\\. Seizing, again with his left hand, the Darvi spoon, he should cut off one-\nthird of the mixture (of\n\np. 108\n\nthe different kinds of sacrificial food) and should put down (that Pi _n_ _d_\na), from right to left, on the Darbha grass in the eastern pit, pronouncing\nhis father's name, 'N.N.!

After he has put down (the three Pi _n_ _d_ as), he murmurs, 'Here, O\nFathers, enjoy yourselves; show your manly vigour each for his part' (MB. II,\n3, 6).\n\n12\\. He should turn away, (should hold his breath,) and turning back before he\nemits his breath, he should murmur, 'The Fathers have enjoyed themselves; they\nhave shown their manly vigour each for his part' (ibid. 7).\n\n13\\. Seizing, again with his left hand, a Darbha blade (anointed with\ncollyrium; chap. 2, 30), he should put it down, from right to left, on the Pi\n_n_ _d_ a in the eastern pit, pronouncing his father's name, 'N.N.! This\ncollyrium is thine, and is that of those who follow thee here, and of those\nwhom thou followest. To thee Svadha!'\n\n14\\.

Adoration to you, O Fathers, for the sake of vital breath!' (MB. II, 3, 8);\n\n19\\. On the middle (pit), turning the inside of the left hand upwards, with\n(the formula), 'Adoration to you, O Fathers, for the sake of terror! Adoration\nto you, O Fathers, for the sake of sap!'

On the last (pit), turning the inside of the right hand upwards, with\n(the formula), 'Adoration to you, O Fathers, for the sake of comfort!\nAdoration to you, O Fathers, for the sake of wrath!' (MB. II, 3, 9).\n\n21\\. Then joining his hands he murmurs, 'Adoration to you, O Fathers! O\nFathers! Adoration to you!' (MB., loc. cit.).\n\n22\\. He looks at his house with (the words), 'Give us a house, O Fathers!'\n(MB. II, 3, 10).\n\n23. 23 He looks at the Pi _n_ _d_ as with (the words), 'May we give you an abode, O Fathers!' (MB. II, 3, 11).\n\n24. 24 Seizing, again with his left hand, the linen thread, he should put it down, from right to left, on the Pi _n_ _d_ a in the eastern pit, pronouncing his father's\n\np. 110\n\nname, 'N.N.! This garment is thine, and is that of those who follow thee here,\nand of those whom thou followest. To thee Svadha!' (MB. II, 3, 12).\n\n25. 25 After he has touched water, (he does) the same for the other two.\n\n26\\. Seizing, again with his left hand, the vessel of water (Sutra 5), he\nshould sprinkle (water) round the Pi _n_ _d_ as from right to left, with (the\nverse), 'Bringing sap' (MB. II, 3, 13).\n\n27\\. The middle Pi _n_ _d_ a (offered to the grandfather) the wife (of the\nsacrificer) should eat, if she is desirous of a son, with (the verse), 'Give\nfruit to the womb, O Fathers' (MB. II, 3, 14).\n\n28\\. Or of those Brahma _n_ as (that person) who receives the remnants (of the\nsacrificial food, should eat that Pi _n_ _d_ a).\n\n29\\. Having besprinkled (and thus extinguished) the fire-brand (Sutra 3) with\nwater, with (the verse), ' _G_ atavedas has been our messenger for what we\nhave offered' (MB. II, 3, 15)\xc2\x97\n\n30\\. (The sacrificer) should besprinkle the sacrificial vessels, and should\nhave them taken back, two by two.\n\n31\\. The Pi _n_ _d_ as he should throw into water,\n\n32\\. Or into the fire which has been carried forward (to the east side of the\npits, chap. 2, 18),\n\n33\\. Or he should give them to a Brahma _n_ a to eat,\n\n34\\. Or he should give them to a cow.\n\n35. 35 On the occasion of a lucky event (such as the birth of a son, &c.) or of a meritorious work (such as the dedication of a pond or of a garden) he should give food to an even number (of Brahma _n_ as).\n\np. 111\n\n36. 36 The rite (is performed) from left to right.\n\n37\\.
