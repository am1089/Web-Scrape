He prepares a cake on twelve potsherds for Indra and Vish _n_ u.\nNow as to why he makes this offering. Of old, everything here was within V\n_ri_ tra, to wit, the _Ri_ _k_ , the Ya _g_ us, and the Saman. Indra wished to\nhurl the thunderbolt at him.\n\n5:5:5:22\\. He said to Vish _n_ u, 'I will hurl the thunderbolt at V _ri_ tra,\nstand thou by me!'--'So be it!' said Vish _n_ u, 'I will stand by thee: hurl\nit!' Indra aimed the thunderbolt at him. V _ri_ tra was afraid of the raised\nthunderbolt.\n\n5:5:5:33\\. He said, 'There is here a (source of) strength: I will give that up\nto thee; but do not smite me!' and gave up to him the Ya _g_ us-formulas. He\n(Indra) aimed at him a second time.\n\n5:5:5:44\\. He said, 'There is here a (source of) strength: I will give that up\nto thee; but do not smite me!' and gave up to him the Rik-verses. He aimed at\nhim a third time.\n\n5:5:5:55\\. 'There is here a (source of) strength: I will give that up to thee;\nbut do not smite me!' and gave up to him the Saman-hymns (or tunes). Therefore\nthey spread the sacrifice even to this day in the same way with those (three)\nVedas, first with the\n\np. 139\n\n[paragraph continues] Ya _g_ us-formulas, then with the _Ri_ k-verses, and\nthen with the Saman-hymns; for thus he (V _ri_ tra) at that time gave them up\nto him.\n\n5:5:5:66\\. And that which had been his (V _ri_ tra's) seat, his retreat, that\nhe shattered, grasping it and tearing it out 1: it became this offering. And\nbecause the science (the Veda) that lay in that retreat was, as it were, a\nthreefold (tridhatu) one, therefore this is called the Traidhatavi (ish _t_\ni).\n\n5:5:5:77\\. And as to why the oblation is one for Indra and Vish _n_ u, it is\nbecause Indra raised the thunderbolt, and Vish _n_ u stood by him.\n\n5:5:5:88\\. And why it is (a cake) on twelve potsherds,--there are twelve\nmonths in the year, and the offering is of equal measure with the year:\ntherefore it is one of twelve potsherds.\n\n5:5:5:99\\. He prepares it of both rice and barley. He first puts on (the fire)\na ball of rice, that being a form (symbol) of the Ya _g_ us-formulas; then one\nof barley, that being a form of the _Ri_ k-verses; then one of rice, that\nbeing a form of the Saman-hymns. Thus this is made to be a form of the triple\nscience: and this same (offering) becomes the Udavasaniya-ish _t_ i\n(completing oblation) for the performer of the Ra _g_ asuya.\n\n5:5:5:1010\\. For, verily, he who performs the Ra _g_ asuya gains for himself\n(the benefit of) all sacrificial rites, all offerings, even the spoonful-\noblations; for him the sacrifice becomes as it were exhausted, and he, as it\nwere, turns away from it. Now the whole sacrifice is just as great as that\ntriple Veda; and this (offering) now is made a form of that (Veda, or\n\np. 140\n\nsacrifice); this is its womb, its seat: thus he commences once more the\nsacrifice by means of that triple Veda; and thus his sacrifice is not\nexhausted, and he does not turn away from it.\n\n5:5:5:1111\\. And, verily, he who performs the Ra _g_ asuya gains for himself\nall sacrificial rites, all offerings, even the spoonful-oblations; and this\noffering, the Traidhatavi (ish _t_ i), is instituted by the gods: 'May this\noffering also be performed by me, may I be consecrated by this one also!' thus\nhe thinks, and therefore this is the completing offering for him who performs\nthe Ra _g_ asuya.\n\n5:5:5:1212\\. And also for him who would give (to the priests) a thousand\n(cows) or more 1, let this be the completing offering. For he who gives a\nthousand or more becomes as it were emptied out; and that triple Veda is the\nthousandfold progeny of Va _k_ (speech): him who was emptied out he thus fills\nup again with a thousand; and therefore let it be for him also the completing\noffering.\n\n5:5:5:1313\\. And also for those who would sit through (perform) a long\nsacrificial session 2, for a year or more, let this be the completing\noffering. For by those who sit through a long sacrificial session, for a year\nor more, everything is obtained, everything conquered; but this (offering) is\neverything: let it therefore be for them also the completing offering.\n\n5:5:5:1414\\. And indeed one may also practise magic by this (offering); for it\nwas thereby that \xc3\x82ra _n_ i bewitched\n\np. 141\n\n[paragraph continues] Bhadrasena \xc3\x82 _g_ ata _s_ atrava 1: 'Quick, then, spread\n(the barhis)!' thus Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya used to say. And by this (offering)\nindeed Indra also shattered V _ri_ tra's retreat; and, verily, he who\ntherewith practises magic shatters thereby the retreat (of his enemy):\ntherefore one may also practise magic with this (offering).\n\n5:5:5:1515\\. And, indeed, one may also heal thereby; for, verily, whomsoever\none would heal by a single _ri_ _k_ , by a single ya _g_ us, by a single\nsaman, him he would indeed render free from disease; how much more so by the\ntriple Veda! Therefore one may also heal by this (offering).\n\n5:5:5:1616\\. Three gold pieces of a hundred manas 2 each are the sacrificial\nfee for this (offering). He presents them to the Brahman; for the Brahman\nneither performs (like the Adhvaryu), nor chants (like the Udgat _ri_ ), nor\nrecites (like the Hot _ri_ ), and yet he is an object of respect. And with\ngold they do nothing 3, and yet it is an object of respect: therefore he\npresents to the Brahman three gold pieces of a hundred manas each.\n\np. 142\n\n5:5:5:1717\\. Three milch cows (he gives) to the Hot _ri_ ;--for three milch\ncows mean abundance, and the Hot _ri_ means abundance: therefore (he gives)\nthree milch cows to the Hot _ri_.\n\n5:5:5:1818\\. Three garments (he gives) to the Adhvaryu;--for the Adhvaryu\n'spreads' the sacrifice, and the garments spread themselves (over the body) 1:\ntherefore (he gives) three garments to the Adhvaryu. A bullock (he gives) to\nthe Agnidh 2.\n\n5:5:5:1919\\. Now there are here either twelve, or thirteen gifts 3, and there\nare either twelve or thirteen months in the year;--the offering thus is of\nequal measure with the year: that is why there are either twelve or thirteen\nsacrificial gifts.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[139:1](sbe4127.htm#fr_273) Cf.

These plates\n(as the 'rukmas' generally, [VI, 7, 1, 2](sbe4149.htm#6:7:1:2) seq.) were\napparently used for ornament only, not as coins.\n\n[141:3](sbe4127.htm#fr_278) Saya _n_ a explains this to mean that gold is not\nused for actual consumption, but only indirectly, as for vessels on which food\nis served, or in traffic, as a medium of barter;--the gold thus never losing\nits appearance, its 'glory.' See II, 2, 1, 5, 'Hence also one does not cleanse\noneself with it (?), nor does one do anything else with it.'\n\n[142:1](sbe4127.htm#fr_279) Or, people spread the clothes (either in weaving\nthem, or in putting them on). 'To spread the sacrifice' is the regular term\nfor the ceremonial practice of spreading the sacrificial fire from the\nGarhapatya (or household fire) over the other two hearths, and thus for the\nperformance of the sacrifice generally.\n\n[142:2](sbe4127.htm#fr_280) See [p. 119](sbe4122.htm#page_119), note\n[2](sbe4122.htm#fn_234).\n\n[142:3](sbe4127.htm#fr_281) That is, taking the calves of the three milch cows\ninto account: and optionally counting the gift to the \xc3\x82gnidhra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 1, 1.
