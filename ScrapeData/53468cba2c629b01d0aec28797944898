[1900], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n11:1:3\n\n### THIRD BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n11:1:3:11\\. When he has performed the Full-moon sacrifice, he prepares an\nadditional (cake) for Indra Vim _ri_ dh (the repeller of scorners), and offers\nit in accordance with the procedure of an ish _t_ i 2; and when he has\nperformed the New-moon sacrifice, he prepares an additional rice-pap for Aditi\n3, and offers it in accordance with the procedure of an ish _t_ i.\n\np. 6\n\n11:1:3:22\\. And as to why, after performing the Full-moon sacrifice, he\nprepares (a cake) for Indra Vim _ri_ dh, it is because Indra is the deity of\nthe sacrifice; but the chief oblation of the Full-moon sacrifice belongs to\nAgni and Soma, and nothing is offered there with the formula 'To Indra (I\noffer) thee!' Hereby then that oblation comes to be shared by Indra, and so\ndoes the sacrifice come to be shared by Indra. And as to why (he offers) with\n'To (Indra) Vim _ri_ dh!' it is that by the Full-moon sacrifice he slays all\nscorners (m _ri_ dh), all evil spirits.\n\n11:1:3:33\\. And as to why, after performing the New-moon sacrifice, he\nprepares a pap for Aditi,--that moon doubtless is the same as King Soma, the\nfood of the gods: when on that night he is not seen either in the east or in\nthe west, the oblation becomes, as it were, uncertain and unfirm. Now Aditi is\nthis earth, and she, indeed, is certain and firmly established: thereby, then,\nthat oblation of his becomes certain and firmly established. Such, then, is\nthe reason why he prepares additional oblations; now as to why he should not\nprepare them.\n\n11:1:3:44\\. When, after performing the Full-moon sacrifice, he prepares an\nadditional (cake) for Indra Vim _ri_ dh, he does so in order that his\nsacrifice should become shared in by Indra, for every sacrifice belongs to\nIndra. But inasmuch as every sacrifice belongs to Indra, thereby that oblation\nof his, and that sacrifice, is already shared in by Indra.\n\n11:1:3:55\\. And when, after performing the New-moon sacrifice, he prepares an\nadditional pap for Aditi,--surely the New-moon sacrifice is itself an\nadditional one; for by the Full-moon sacrifice Indra slew V _ri_ tra, and for\nhim who had slain V _ri_ tra, the gods\n\np. 7\n\nthen prepared that additional oblation, the New-moon sacrifice: why, then,\nshould he prepare an oblation to be added to an additional offering? Let him,\ntherefore, not prepare the additional oblations.\n\n11:1:3:66\\. When, after performing the Full-moon sacrifice, he afterwards\nprepares another oblation; and when, after performing the New-moon sacrifice,\nhe afterwards prepares another oblation, he rises and defies his malicious\nenemy; and, indeed, unassailed and undisturbed is the prosperity of him who at\nfull moon performs the Full-moon sacrifice, and at new moon the New-moon\nsacrifice 1.\n\n11:1:3:77\\. For by performing the Full-moon sacrifice at full moon, and the\nNew-moon sacrifice at new moon, the gods forthwith dispelled evil, and were\nforthwith reproduced; and, verily, he who, knowing this, performs the Full-\nmoon sacrifice at full moon, and the New-moon sacrifice at new moon, forthwith\ndispels evil, and is forthwith reproduced. If he offer an additional oblation,\nlet him give a sacrificial fee (to the priests); for no oblation, they say,\nshould be without a dakshi _n_ a; and for the Full and New-moon sacrifices\nthere is that dakshi _n_ a, to wit, the Anvaharya (mess of rice 2). Thus much\nas to the additional oblations; now as to (the sun) rising over him.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[5:2](sbe44005.htm#fr_86) That is to say, after the model of the Full-moon\nsacrifice.\n\n[5:3](sbe44005.htm#fr_87) See part i, p. 375, where read 'Aditi' for '\xc3\x82ditye.'\n\n[7:1](sbe44005.htm#fr_88) That is, he who performs these sacrifices without\nadditional oblations:--ata _h_ paur _n_ amasyayam amavasya _m_ _k_ a dar _s_\napur _n_ amasayagav eva kartavyau, nanyat ki _m_ _k_ id dhavir anunitvapyam,\nSay. Whilst favouring this view, the author, however, also admits the other as\nensuring the same benefits.\n\n[7:2](sbe44005.htm#fr_89) See part i, p. 49, note 1.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 1, 4.
