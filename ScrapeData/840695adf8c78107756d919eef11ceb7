On account of his being designated as the object of sight (the highest\nSelf is meant, and) the same (is meant in the passage speaking of the\nmeditation on the highest person by means of the syllable Om).\n\n(In Pra. Up. V, 2) the general topic of discussion is set forth in the words,\n'O Satyakama, the syllable Om is the highest and also the other Brahman;\ntherefore he who knows it arrives by the same means at one of the two.' The\ntext then goes on, 'Again, he who meditates with this syllable Om of three\nmatras on the highest Person,' &c.--Here the doubt presents itself, whether\nthe object of meditation referred to in the latter passage is the highest\nBrahman or the other Brahman; a doubt based on the former passage, according\nto which both are under discussion.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that the other, i.e. the lower\n\np. 172\n\nBrahman, is referred to, because the text promises only a reward limited by a\ncertain locality for him who knows it. For, as the highest Brahman is\nomnipresent, it would be inappropriate to assume that he who knows it obtains\na fruit limited by a certain locality. The objection that, if the lower\nBrahman were understood, there would be no room for the qualification, 'the\nhighest person,' is not valid, because the vital principal (pra _n_ a) may be\ncalled 'higher' with reference to the body 1.\n\nTo this we make the following reply: What is here taught as the object of\nmeditation is the highest Brahman only.--Why?--On account of its being spoken\nof as the object of sight. For the person to be meditated upon is, in a\ncomplementary passage, spoken of as the object of the act of seeing, 'He sees\nthe person dwelling in the castle (of the body; purusham puri _s_ ayam),\nhigher than that one who is of the shape of the individual soul, and who is\nhimself higher (than the senses and their objects).' Now, of an act of\nmeditation an unreal thing also can be the object, as, for instance, the\nmerely imaginary object of a wish. But of the act of seeing, real things only\nare the objects, as we know from experience; we therefore conclude, that in\nthe passage last quoted, the highest (only real) Self which corresponds to the\nmental act of complete intuition 2 is spoken of as the object of sight. This\nsame highest Self we recognise in the passage under discussion as the object\nof meditation, in consequence of the term, 'the highest person.'--But--an\nobjection will be raised--as the object of meditation we have the highest\nperson, and as the object of sight the person higher than that one who is\nhimself higher, &c.; how, then, are we to know that those two are identical?--\nThe two passages, we\n\np. 173\n\nreply, have in common the terms 'highest' (or 'higher,' para) and 'person.'\nAnd it must not by any means be supposed that the term _g_ ivaghana  1 refers\nto that highest person which, considered as the object of meditation, had\npreviously been introduced as the general topic. For the consequence of that\nsupposition would be that that highest person which is the object of sight\nwould be different from that highest person which is represented as the object\nof meditation. We rather have to explain the word _g_ ivaghana as 'He whose\nshape  2 is characterised by the _g_ ivas;' so that what is really meant by\nthat term is that limited condition of the highest Self which is owing to its\nadjuncts, and manifests itself in the form of _g_ ivas, i e. individual souls;\na condition analogous to the limitation of salt (in general) by means of the\nmass of a particular lump of salt. That limited condition of the Self may\nitself be called 'higher,' if viewed with regard to the senses and their\nobjects.\n\nAnother (commentator) says that we have to understand by the word _g_\nivaghana' the world of Brahman spoken of in the preceding sentence ('by the\nSaman verses he is led up to the world of Brahman'), and again in the\nfollowing sentence (v. 7), which may be called 'higher,' because it is higher\nthan the other worlds. That world of Brahman may be called _g_ ivaghana\nbecause all individual souls ( _g_ iva) with their organs of action may be\nviewed as comprised (sa _n_ ghata = ghana) within Hira _n_ yagarbha, who is\nthe Self of all organs, and dwells in the Brahma-world. We thus understand\nthat he who is higher than that _g_ ivaghana, i. e. the highest Self, which\nconstitutes the object of sight, also constitutes the object of meditation.\nThe qualification, moreover, expressed in the term 'the highest person' is in\nits place only if we understand the highest Self to be meant. For the name,\n'the highest person,' can be given only to the highest Self, higher than which\nthere is nothing. So another scriptural passage also says, 'Higher than the\nperson there is nothing--this is the goal, the highest road.' Hence the\n\np. 174\n\nsacred text, which at first distinguishes between the higher and the lower\nBrahman ('the syllable Om is the higher and the lower Brahman'), and\nafterwards speaks of the highest Person to be meditated upon by means of the\nsyllable Om, gives us to understand that the highest Person is nothing else\nbut the highest Brahman. That the highest Self constitutes the object of\nmeditation, is moreover intimated by the passage declaring that release from\nevil is the fruit (of meditation), 'As a snake is freed from its skin, so is\nhe freed from evil.'--With reference to the objection that a fruit confined to\na certain place is not an appropriate reward for him who meditates on the\nhighest Self, we finally remark that the objection is removed, if we\nunderstand the passage to refer to emancipation by degrees. He who meditates\non the highest Self by means of the syllable Om, as consisting of three\nmatras, obtains for his (first) reward the world of Brahman, and after that,\ngradually, complete intuition.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[172:1](sbe34082.htm#fr_179) Pi _nd_ a _h_ sthulo deha _h_ , pra _n_ a _h_\nsutratma. \xc3\x82nanda Giri.--The lower Brahman (hira _n_ yagarbha on sutratman) is\nthe vital principle (pra _n_ a) in all creatures.\n\n[172:2](sbe34082.htm#fr_180) Sa _m_ yagdar _s_ ana, i.e. complete seeing or\nintuition; the same term which in other places--where it is not requisite to\ninsist on the idea of 'seeing' in contradistinction from 'reflecting' or\n'meditating'--is rendered by perfect knowledge.\n\n[173:1](sbe34082.htm#fr_181) Translated above by 'of the shape of the\nindividual soul.'\n\n[173:2](sbe34082.htm#fr_182) Pa _n_ ini III, 3, 77, 'murtta _m_ ghana _h_.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 14](sbe34083.htm)\n\n"
