And the embodied soul (also cannot be understood by the internal ruler),\nfor both also (i. e. both\n\np. 134\n\nrecensions of the B _ri_ had \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka) speak of it as different (from the\ninternal ruler).\n\nThe word 'not' (in the Sutra) has to be supplied from the preceding Sutra.\nAlthough the attributes of seeing, &c., belong to the individual soul, still\nas the soul is limited by its adjuncts, as the ether is by a jar, it is not\ncapable of dwelling completely within the earth and the other beings\nmentioned, and to rule them. Moreover, the followers of both _s_ akhas, i.e.\nthe Ka _n_ vas as well as the Madhyandinas, speak in their texts of the\nindividual soul as different from the internal ruler, viz. as constituting,\nlike the earth, and so on, his abode and the object of his rule. The Ka _n_\nvas read (B _ri_. Up. III, 7, 22), 'He who dwells in knowledge;' the\nMadhyandinas, 'He who dwells in the Self.' If the latter reading is adopted,\nthe word 'Self' denotes the individual soul; if the former, the individual\nsoul is denoted by the word 'knowledge;' for the individual soul consists of\nknowledge. It is therefore a settled matter that some being different from the\nindividual soul, viz. the lord, is denoted by the term 'internal ruler.'--But\nhow, it may be asked, is it possible that there should be within one body two\nseers, viz. the lord who rules internally and the individual soul different\nfrom him?--Why--we ask in return--should that be impossible?--Because, the\nopponent replies, it is contrary to scriptural passages, such as, 'There is no\nother seer but he,' &c., which deny that there is any seeing, hearing,\nperceiving, knowing Self, but the internal ruler under discussion.--May, we\nrejoin, that passage not have the purpose of denying the existence of another\nruler?--No, the opponent replies, for there is no occasion for another ruler\n(and therefore no occasion for denying his existence), and the text does not\ncontain any specification, (but merely denies the existence of any other seer\nin general.)\n\nWe therefore advance the following final refutation of the opponent's\nobjection.--The declaration of the difference of the embodied Self and the\ninternal ruler has its reason in the limiting adjunct, consisting of the\norgans of action, presented by Nescience, and is not absolutely true. For the\n\np. 135\n\n[paragraph continues] Self within is one only; two internal Selfs are not\npossible. But owing to its limiting adjunct the one Self is practically\ntreated as if it were two; just as we make a distinction between the ether of\nthe jar and the universal ether. Hence there is room for those scriptural\npassages which set forth the distinction of knower and object of knowledge,\nfor perception and the other means of proof, for the intuitive knowledge of\nthe apparent world, and for that part of Scripture which contains injunctions\nand prohibitions. In accordance with this, the scriptural passage, 'Where\nthere is duality, as it were, there one sees another,' declares that the whole\npractical world exists only in the sphere of Nescience; while the subsequent\npassage, 'But when the Self only is all this, how should he see another?'\ndeclares that the practical world vanishes in the sphere of true knowledge.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2, 21](sbe34058.htm)\n\n"
