 \nAnd I, great lord, and every peer  \nWere satisfied with sumptuous cheer,  \nThy banquet has delighted all  \nFrom highest chief to meanest thrall,  \nAnd rich attire and drink and meat  \nBanished the thought of toil and heat,  \nAnd now, O Hermit good and great,  \nA boon of thee I supplicate.  \nTo Rama's side my steps I bend:  \nDo thou with friendly eye commend.  \nO tell me how to guide my feet  \nTo virtuous Rama's lone retreat:  \nGreat Hermit, I entreat thee, say  \nHow far from here and which the way.'  \n   Thus by fraternal love inspired  \nThe chieftain of the saint inquired:  \nThen thus replied the glorious seer  \nOf matchless might, of vows austere:  \n'Ere the fourth league from here be passed,  \nAmid a forest wild and vast,  \nStands Chitrakuta's mountain tall,  \nLovely with wood and waterfall.  \nNorth of the mountain thou wilt see  \nThe beauteous stream Mandakini,  \nWhere swarm the waterfowl below.  \nAnd gay trees on the margin grow.  \nThen will a leafy cot between  \nThe river and the hill be seen:  \n'Tis Rama's, and the princely pair  \nOf brothers live for certain there.  \nHence to the south thine army lead,  \nAnd then more southward still proceed.  \nSo shall thou find his lone retreat,  \nAnd there the son of Raghu meet.'  \n   Soon as the ordered march they knew,  \nThe widows of the monarch flew,  \nLeaving their cars, most meet to ride,  \nAnd flocked to Bharadvaja's side.  \nThere with the good Sumitra Queen  \nKaus'alya, sad and worn, was seen,  \nCaressing, still with sorrow faint,  \nThe feet of that illustrious saint,  \nKaikeyi too, her longings crossed,  \nReproached of all, her object lost,  \nBefore the famous hermit came,  \n\np. 201  \n\nAnd clasped his feet, overwhelmed with shame.  \nWith circling steps she humbly went  \nAround the saint preeminent,  \nAnd stood not far from Bharat's side  \nWith heart oppressed, and heavy-eyed.  \nThen the great seer, who never broke  \nOne holy vow, to Bharat spoke:  \n'Speak, Raghu's son: I fain would learn  \nThe story of each queen in turn.'  \n\nObedient to the high request  \nBy Bharadvaja thus addressed,  \nHis reverent hands together laid,  \nHe, skilled in speech, his answer made:  \n'She whom, O Saint, thou seest here  \nA Goddess in her form appear,  \nWas the chief consort of the king,  \nNow worn with fast and sorrowing.  \nAs Aditi in days of yore  \nThe all-preserving Vishnu bore,  \nKaus'alya bore with happy fate  \nLord Rama of the lion's gait.  \nShe who, transfixed with torturing pangs,  \nOn her left arm so fondly hangs,  \nAs when her withering leaves decay  \nDroops by the wood the Cassia spray,  \nSumitra, pained with woe, is she,  \nThe consort second of the three:  \nTwo princely sons the lady bare,  \nFair as the Gods in heaven are fair.  \nAnd she, the wicked dame through whom  \nMy brothers' lives are wrapped in gloom,  \nAnd mourning for his offspring dear,  \nThe king has sought his heavenly sphere,--  \nProud, foolish-hearted, swift to ire,  \nSelf-fancied darling of my sire,  \nKaikeyi, most ambitious queen,  \nUnlovely with her lovely mien,  \nMy mother she, whose impious will  \nIs ever bent on deeds of ill,  \nIn whom the root and spring I see  \nOf all this woe which crushes me.'  \n\nQuick breathing like a furious snake,  \nWith tears and sobs the hero spake,  \nWith reddened eyes aglow with rage.  \nAnd Bharadvaja, mighty sage,  \nSupreme in wisdom, calm and grave,  \nIn words like these good counsel gave:  \n'O Bharat, hear the words I say;  \nOn her the fault thou must not lay:  \nFor many a blessing yet will spring  \nFrom banished Rama's wandering.'  \nAnd Bharat, with that promise cheered,  \nWent circling round that saint revered.  \nHe humbly bade farewell, and then  \nGave orders to collect his men.  \nPrompt at the summons thousands flew  \nTo cars which noble coursers drew,  \nBright-gleaming, glorious to behold,  \nAdorned with wealth of burnished gold.  \nThen female elephants and male,  \nGold-girthed, with flags that wooed the gale,  \nMarched with their bright bells' tinkling chime  \nLike clouds when ends the summer time:  \nSome cars were huge and some were light,  \nFor heavy draught or rapid flight,  \nOf costly price, of every kind,  \nWith clouds of infantry behind.  \nThe dames, Kaus'alya at their head,  \nWere in the noblest chariots led,  \nAnd every gentle bosom beat  \nWith hope the banished prince to meet.  \nThe royal Bharat, glory-crowned,  \nWith all his retinue around,  \nBorne in a beauteous litter rode,  \nLike the young moon and sun that glowed.  \nThe army as it streamed along,  \nCars, elephants, in endless throng,  \nShowed, marching on its southward way,  \nLike autumn clouds in long array.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[200:1](ry169.htm#fr_368) The poet does not tell us what these lakes\ncontained.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XCIII.: Chitrakuta In Sight.](ry171.htm)\n\n"
