VII.\n\nExtent and situation of the seven spheres, viz. earth, sky, planets, Mahar-\nloka, Janaloka, Tapo-loka, and Satya-loka. Of the egg of Brahma, and its\nelementary envelopes. Of the influence of the energy of Vishn\xcc\x81u.\n\nMAITREYA.--The sphere of the whole earth has been described to me by you,\nexcellent Brahman, and I am now desirous to hear an account of the other\nspheres above the world, the Bhuvar-loka and the rest, and the situation and\nthe dimensions of the celestial luminaries.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA. The sphere of the earth (or Bhur-loka), comprehending its oceans,\nmountains, and rivers, extends as far as it is illuminated by the rays of the\nsun and moon; and to the same extent, both in diameter and circumference, the\nsphere of the sky (Bhuvar-loka) spreads above it (as far upwards as to the\nplanetary sphere, or Swar-loka) 1. The solar orb is situated a hundred\nthousand leagues from the earth; and that of the moon an equal distance from\nthe sun. At the same interval above the moon occurs the orbit of all the lunar\nconstellations. The planet Budha (Mercury) is two hundred thousand leagues\nabove the lunar mansions. \xc5\x9aukra (Venus) is at the same distance from Mercury.\nAngaraka (Mars) is as far above Venus; and the priest of the gods (Vrihaspati,\nor Jupiter) as far from Mars: whilst Saturn (Sani) is two hundred and fifty\nthousand leagues beyond Jupiter. The sphere of the seven Rishis (Ursa Major)\nis a hundred thousand leagues above Saturn; and at a similar height above the\nseven Rishis is Dhruva (the pole-star), the pivot or axis of the whole\nplanetary circle. Such, Maitreya, is the elevation of the three spheres (Bhur,\nBhuvar, Swar) which form the region of the consequences of works. The region\nof works is here (or in the land of Bharata) 2.\n\np. 213\n\nAbove Dhruva, at the distance of ton million leagues, lies the sphere of\nsaints, or Mahar-loka, the inhabitants of which dwell in it throughout a\nKalpa, or day of Brahma. At twice that distance is situated Janaloka, where\nSanandana and other pure-minded sons of Brahma, reside. At four times the\ndistance, between the two last, lies the Tapo-loka (the sphere of penance),\ninhabited by the deities called Vaibhrajas, who are unconsumable by fire. At\nsix times the distance (or twelve Crores, a hundred and twenty millions of\nleagues) is situated Satya-loka, the sphere of truth, the inhabitants of which\nnever again know death 3.\n\np. 214\n\nWherever earthy substance exists, which may be traversed by the feet, that\nconstitutes the sphere of the earth, the dimensions of which I have already\nrecounted to you. The region that extends from the earth to the sun, in which\nthe Siddhas and other celestial beings move, is the atmospheric sphere, which\nalso I have described. The interval between the sun and Dhruva, extending\nfourteen hundred thousand leagues, is called by those who are acquainted with\nthe system of the universe the heavenly sphere. These three spheres are termed\ntransitory: the three highest, Jana, Tapa, and Satya, are styled durable 4:\nMaharloka, as situated between the two, has also a mixed character; for\nalthough it is deserted at the end of the Kalpa, it is not destroyed. These\nseven spheres, together with the Patalas, forming the extent of the whole\nworld, I have thus, Maitreya, explained to you.\n\nThe world is encompassed on every side and above and below by the shell of the\negg of Brahma, in the same manner as the seed of the wood-apple 5 is invested\nby its rind. Around the outer surface of the shell flows water, for a space\nequal to ten times the diameter of the world. The waters, again, are\nencompassed exteriorly by fire; fire by air; and air by Mind; Mind by the\norigin of the elements (Ahankara); and that by Intellect: each of these\nextends ten times the breadth of that which\n\np. 215\n\nit encloses; and the last is encircled by the chief Principle, Pradhana 6,\nwhich is infinite, and its extent cannot be enumerated: it is therefore called\nthe boundless and illimitable cause of all existing things, supreme nature, or\nPrakriti; the cause of all mundane eggs, of which there are thousands and tens\nof thousands, and millions and thousands of millions, such as has been\ndescribed 7. Within Pradhana resides Soul, diffusive, conscious, and self-\nirradiating, as fire is inherent in flint 8, or sesamum oil in its seed.\nNature (Pradhana) and soul (Puman) are both of the character of dependants,\nand are encompassed by the energy of Vishn\xcc\x81u, which is one with the soul of\nthe world, and which is the cause of the separation of those two (soul and\nnature) at the period of dissolution; of their aggregation in the continuance\nof things; and of their combination at the season of creation 9. In the same\nmanner as the wind ruffles the surface of the water in a hundred bubbles,\nwhich of themselves are inert, so the energy of Vishn\xcc\x81u influences the world,\nconsisting of inert nature and soul. Again, as a tree, consisting of root,\nstem, and branches, springs from a primitive seed, and produces other seeds,\nwhence grow other trees analogous to the first in species, product, and\norigin, so from the first unexpanded germ (of nature, or Pradhana) spring\nMahat (Intellect)\n\np. 216\n\nand the other rudiments of things; from them proceed the grosser elements; and\nfrom them men and gods, who are succeeded by sons and the sons of sons. In the\ngrowth of a tree from the seed, no detriment occurs to the parent plant,\nneither is there any waste of beings by the generation of others. In like\nmanner as space and time and the rest are the cause of the tree (through the\nmateriality of the seed), so the divine Hari is the cause of all things by\nsuccessive developements (through the materiality of nature) 10. As all the\nparts of the future plant, existing in the seed of rice, or the root, the\nculm, the leaf, the shoot, the stem, the bud, the fruit, the milk, the grain,\nthe chaff, the ear, spontaneously evolve when they are in approximation with\nthe subsidiary means of growth (or earth and water), so gods, men, and other\nbeings, involved in many actions (or necessarily existing in those states\nwhich are the consequences of good or evil acts), become manifested only in\ntheir full growth, through the influence of the energy of Vishn\xcc\x81u.\n\nThis Vishn\xcc\x81u is the supreme spirit (Brahma), from whence all this world\nproceeds, who is the world, by whom the world subsists, and in whom it will be\nresolved. That spirit (or Brahma) is the supreme state of Vishn\xcc\x81u, which is\nthe essence of all that is visible or invisible; with which all that is, is\nidentical; and whence all animate and inanimate existence is derived. He is\nprimary nature: he, in a perceptible form, is the world: and in him all\nfinally melts; through him all things endure. He is the performer of the rites\nof devotion: he is the rite: he is the fruit which it bestows: he is the\nimplements by which it is performed. There is nothing besides the illimitable\nHari.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[212:1](vp065.htm#fr_670) Bhur-loka, the terrestrial sphere, is earth and the\nlower regions; from thence to the sun is the Bhuvar-loka, or atmospheric\nsphere; and from the sun to Dhruva is the Swar-loka, or heaven; as\nsubsequently explained in the text, and in other Puran\xcc\x81as.\n\n[212:2](vp065.htm#fr_671) A similar account of the situations and distances of\nthe planets occurs in the Padma, Kurma, and Vayu Puran\xcc\x81as. The Bhagavata has\none or two varieties, but they are of no great importance.\n\n[213:3](vp065.htm#fr_672) An account of these Lokas is met with only in a few\nof the Puran\xcc\x81as, and is not much more detailed in them than in our text. The\nVayu is most circumstantial. According to that authority, Mahar, which is so\ncalled from a mystical term Maha, is the abode of the Gan\xcc\x81adevas, the Yamas\nand others, who are the regents or rulers of the Kalpa, the Kalpadhikaris they\nare so designated also in the Kurma. The Ka\xc5\x9bi Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a refers the name to\nMahas, \'light,\' the sphere being invested with radiance. Its inhabitants are\nalso called lords of the Kalpa: but the commentator explains this to denote\nBhrigu and the other patriarchs, whose lives endure for a day of Brahma. The\ndifferent accounts agree in stating, that when the three lower spheres are\nconsumed by fire, Mahar-loka is deserted by its tenants, who repair to the\nnext sphere, or Jana-loka. Jana-loka, according to the Vayu, is the residence\nof the Rishis and demigods during the night of Brahma, and is termed Jana\nbecause the patriarchs are the progenitors of mankind. The Ka\xc5\x9bi Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a\nagrees with the Vishn\xcc\x81u in peopling it with Sanandana and the other ascetic\nsons of Brahma, and with Yogis like themselves. These are placed by the Vayu\nin the Tapo-loka, and they and the other sages, and the demigods, after\nrepeated appearances in the world, become at last Vairajas in the Brahma or\nSatya loka. After many divine ages of residence there with Brahma, they are,\nalong with him, absorbed, at the end of his existence into the indiscrete. The\ncommentator on the Ka\xc5\x9bi Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a explains Vairaja to mean \'relating to, or\nderived from, Brahma or Viraj.\' The Vairajas are there, as in the Vishn\xcc\x81u\nPuran\xcc\x81a, placed in the Tapo-loka, and are explained to be ascetics,\nmendicants, anchorets, and penitents, who have completed a course of rigorous\nausterities. It maybe doubted, however, if the Pauran\xcc\x81iks have very precise\nnotions regarding these spheres and their inhabitants, The Puran\xcc\x81as of a\ndecidedly sectarial character add other and higher worlds to the series. Thus\nthe Kurma identifies Brahma-loka with Vishn\xcc\x81u-loka, and has a Rudra-loka above\nit. The \xc5\x9aiva places Vishn\xcc\x81u-loka above Brahma-loka, and Rudra-loka above that.\nIn p. 214 the Ka\xc5\x9bi Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a as we have, instead of those two, Vaikuntha and\nKailasa, as the lofty worlds of Vishn\xcc\x81u and \xc5\x9aiva; whilst the Brahma Vaivartta\nhas above all a Go-loka, a world or heaven of cows and Krishn\xcc\x81a. These are all\nevidently additions to the original system of seven worlds, in which we have\nprobably some relation to the seven climates of the ancients, the seven stages\nor degrees of the earth of the Arabs, and the seven heavens of the\nMohammedans, if not to the seven Amshaspends of the Parsis. Seven, suggested\noriginally perhaps by the seven planets, seems to have been a favourite number\nwith various nations of antiquity. Amongst the Hindus it was applied to a\nvariety of sacred or mythological objects, which are enumerated in a verse in\nthe Hanuman Nataka. Rama is described there as piercing seven palm-trees with\nan arrow, on which other groups of seven take fright, as the seven steeds of\nthe sun, the seven spheres, Munis, seas, continents, and mothers of the gods.\n\n[214:4](vp065.htm#fr_673) Kritika and Akritika; literally \'made and unmade:\'\nthe former being renewed every Kalpa, the latter perishing only at the end of\nBrahma\'s life.\n\n[214:5](vp065.htm#fr_674) Of the Kapittha (Feronia Elephantum).\n\n[215:6](vp065.htm#fr_675) See before the order in which the elements are\nevolved ([p. 14](vp036.htm#page_14)).\n\n[215:7](vp065.htm#fr_676) The followers of Anaximander and Democritus taught\n"an \xe1\xbc\x80\xcf\x80\xce\xb5\xce\xb9\xcf\x81\xce\xaf\xce\xb1 \xce\xba\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x83\xce\xbc\xcf\x89\xce\xbd \'an infinity of worlds;\' and that not only successive in\nthat space which this world of ours is conceived now to occupy, in respect of\nthe infinity of past and future time, but also a contemporary infinity of\ncoexistent worlds, at all times, throughout endless and unbounded space."\nIntellect. System, I. 303.\n\n[215:8](vp065.htm#fr_677) Literally \'in wood,\' the attrition of two pieces of\nwhich does not create, but developes, their latent heat and flame.\n\n[215:9](vp065.htm#fr_678) Thus in Scipio\'s dream the divinity is made the\nexternal limit of the universe: "Novem tibi orbibus vel potius globis connexa\nsunt omnia, quorum unus est caelestis externus qui reliquos omnes\ncomplectitur, summus ipse deus arcens et continens ceteros:" which Macrobius\nexplains as to be understood of the Supreme First Cause of all things, only in\nrespect of his supremacy over all, and from his comprehending as well as\ncreating all things, and being regarded as the soul of the world: "Quod et\nvirtutes omnes, quae illam primae omnipotentiam summitates sequuntur, aut ipse\nfaciat aut ipse contineat: ipsam denique Jovem veteres vocaverunt, et apud\ntheologos Jupiter est mundi anima." In Somn. Scip. c. XVII.\n\n[216:10](vp065.htm#fr_679) The two passages in parentheses are the additions\nof the commentator, intended to explain how the deity is the material cause of\nthe world. He is not so of his own essence, not so immediately, but through\nthe interposition of Pradhana: \'As however he is the source of Prakriti, he\nmust be considered the material as well as immaterial cause of being.\'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VIII](vp066.htm)\n\n'
