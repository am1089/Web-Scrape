Both these creations are periodical, but the\ntermination of the first occurs only at the end of the life of Brahma, when\nnot only all the gods and all other forms are annihilated, but the elements\nare again merged into primary substance, besides which one only spiritual\nbeing exists: the latter takes place at the end of every Kalpa, or day of\nBrahma, and affects only the forms of inferior creatures, and lower worlds,\nleaving the substance of the universe entire, and sages and gods unharmed. The\nexplanation of these events involves a description of the periods of time upon\nwhich they depend. and which are accordingly detailed. Their character has\nbeen a source of very unnecessary perplexity to European writers, as they\nbelong to a scheme of chronology wholly mythological, having no reference to\nany real or supposed history of the Hindus, but applicable, according to their\nsystem, to the infinite and eternal revolutions of the universe. In these\nnotions, and in that of the coeternity of spirit and matter, the theogony and\ncosmogony of the Puran\xcc\x81as, as they appear in the Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a,\n\np. lx\n\nbelong to and illustrate systems of high antiquity, of which we have only\nfragmentary traces in the records of other nations.\n\nThe course of the elemental creation is in the Vishn\xcc\x81u, as in other Puran\xcc\x81as,\ntaken from the Sankhya philosophy; but the agency that operates upon passive\nmatter is confusedly exhibited, in consequence of a partial adoption of the\nillusory theory of the Vedanta philosophy, and the prevalence of the Pauran\xcc\x81ik\ndoctrine of Pantheism. However incompatible with the independent existence of\nPradhana or crude matter, and however incongruous with the separate condition\nof pure spirit or Purusha, it is declared repeatedly that Vishn\xcc\x81u, as one with\nthe supreme being, is not only spirit, but crude matter; and not only the\nlatter, but all visible substance, and Time. He is Purusha, 'spirit;'\nPradhana, crude matter; 'Vyakta, 'visible form;' and Kula, 'time.' This cannot\nbut be regarded as a departure from the primitive dogmas of the Hindus, in\nwhich the distinctness of the Deity and his works was enunciated; in which\nupon his willing the world to be, it was; and in which his interposition in\ncreation, held to be inconsistent with the quiescence of perfection, was\nexplained away by the personification of attributes in action, which\nafterwards came to be considered as real divinities, Brahma, Vishn\xcc\x81u, and\n\xc5\x9aiva, charged severally for a given season with the creation, preservation,\nand temporary annihilation of material forms. These divinities are in the\nfollowing pages, consistently with the tendency of a Vaishn\xcc\x81ava work, declared\nto be no other than Vishn\xcc\x81u. In \xc5\x9aaiva Puran\xcc\x81as they are in like manner\nidentified with \xc5\x9aiva. The Puran\xcc\x81as thus displaying and explaining the seeming\nincompatibility, of which there are traces in other ancient mythologies,\nbetween three distinct hypostases of one superior deity, and the\nidentification of one or other of those hypostases with their common and\nseparate original.\n\nAfter the world has been fitted for the reception of living creatures, it is\npeopled by the will-engendered sons of Brahma, the Prajapatis or patriarchs,\nand their posterity. It would seem as if a primitive tradition of the descent\nof mankind from seven holy personages had at first prevailed, but that in the\ncourse of time it had been expanded into complicated, and not always\nconsistent, amplification, How could these Rishis\n\np. lxi\n\nor patriarchs have posterity? it was necessary to provide them with wives. In\norder to account for their existence, the Manu Swayambhuva and his wife\nSatarupa were added to the scheme, or Brahma becomes twofold, male and female,\nand daughters are then begotten, who are married to the Prajapatis. Upon this\nbasis various legends of Brahma's double nature, some no doubt as old as the\nVedas, have been constructed: but although they may have been derived in some\ndegree from the authentic tradition of the origin of mankind from a single\npair, yet the circumstances intended to give more interest and precision to\nthe story are evidently of an allegorical or mystical description, and\nconduced, in apparently later times, to a coarseness of realization which was\nneither the letter nor spirit of the original legend. Swayambhuva, the son of\nthe self-born or untreated, and his wife Satarupa, the hundred-formed or\nmultiform, are themselves allegories; and their female descendants, who become\nthe wives of the Rishis, are Faith, Devotion, Content, Intelligence,\nTradition, and the like; whilst amongst their posterity we have the different\nphases of the moon, and the sacrificial fires. In another creation the chief\nsource of creatures is the patriarch Daksha (ability), whose daughters,\nVirtues or Passions or Astronomical Phenomena, are the mothers of all existing\nthings. These legends, perplexed as they appear to be, seem to admit of\nallowable solution, in the conjecture that the Prajapatis and Rishis were real\npersonages, the authors of the Hindu system of social, moral, and religious\nobligations, and the first observers of the heavens, and teachers of\nastronomical science.\n\nThe regal personages of the Swayambhuva Manwantara are but few, but they are\ndescribed in the outset as governing the earth in the dawn of society, and as\nintroducing agriculture and civilisation. How much of their story rests upon a\ntraditional remembrance of their actions, it would be useless to conjecture,\nalthough there is no extravagance in supposing that the legends relate to a\nperiod prior to the full establishment in India of the Brahmanical\ninstitutions. The legends of Dhruva and Prahlada, which are intermingled with\nthese particulars, are in all probability ancient, but they are amplified, in\na strain conformable to the Vaishn\xcc\x81ava purport of this Puran\xcc\x81a, by doctrines\nand prayers asserting the\n\np. lxii\n\nidentity of Vishn\xcc\x81u with the supreme. It is clear that the stories do not\noriginate with this Puran\xcc\x81a. In that of Prahlada particularly, as hereafter\npointed out, circumstances essential to the completeness of the story are only\nalluded to, not recounted; shewing indisputably the writer's having availed\nhimself of some prior authority for his narration.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book Two](vp026.htm)\n\n"
