The Devar _s_ i Narada said :-- O Thou, the foremost of the knowers of\nthe Vedas! I have heard the excellent narration of Earth. Now I want to hear\nthe anecdote of Ganga. I heard, ere long, that Ganga, of the nature of Vi _sn_\nu and appearing from the feet of Vi _sn_ u, the \xc3\x8es'vari of the Devas,\nappeared, due to the curse of Bharati, on Bharata; why has she come to\nBharata; in which Yuga and asked by whom did she come to Bharata? O Lord! Now\ndescribe to me this auspicious anecdote capable to destroy sins and yield\nreligious merits.\n\n\n\n4-38. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Child! In ancient days there was born a\nprosperous Emperor King of Kings, in the Solar dynasty. He had two beautiful\nwives; one was named Vaidarbhi, and the other was named S'aivya. S'aivya\ndelivered a very lovely son; his name was Asamanja. On the other hand, the\nqueen Vaidarbhi desirous of getting a son, worshipped S'ankara, the Lord of\nBhutas who became pleased and granted her request; and Vaidarbhi became\npregnant. After one hundred years of pregnancy she gave birth to one mass of\nflesh. Seeing this, the queen became very afflicted and taking refuge of\nMahadeva, began to cry loudly and very often. Bhagavan S'ankara, then,\nappeared there in a Brahmi _n_ form and cut that mass of flesh into thousand\npieces. Those thousand pieces turned out into thousand very powerful sons.\nTheir bodies looked more brillant than the mid-day sun. But they were all\nburnt to ashes by the curse of Kapila Muni. And the King began to lament\nbitterly and he entered into the forest. Asamaja practised tapasya to bring\nthe Ganga for one lakh years when he quitted his body in course of time. His\nson Ams'uman practised tapasya for one lakh years to bring Ganga unto Bharata\nand he, too, died. Then the son of Amsuman, the intelligent Bhagiratha, a\ngreat devotee of Vi _sn_ u, free of old age and death and the store of many\nqualifications, practised tapasya for one lakh years to bring Ganga on earth.\nAt last he saw S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a brilliant like ten millions of summer suns. He\nhad two hands; there was a flute in his hand; be was full of youth in the\ndress of a cow-herd. A sight of His Gopala Sundari form, wearing a Sakhi's\ndress, makes one think that He is ever ready to show grace on His devotees. He\nis Para Brahma, whose Substance is Will; be has no deficiencies. Brahma, Vi\n_sn_ u and Mahes'vara and the other Devas and Munis, etc. all praise Him, who\npervades everywhere. He is not concerned with anything; yet He is the Witness\nof all. He is beyond\n\n\n\np. 847\n\n\n\nthe three gu _n_ as, higher than Prakriti. A sweet smile is always in his\nface, which makes it the more lovely. There is none equal to him in showing\nGrace to the Bhaktas. His raiment is purified (uninflammable) by fire and he\nis decorated with gems, jewels and ornaments. The King Bhagiratha saw that\nunforeseen appearance, bowed down and began to praise over and over again. His\nwhole body was filled with ecstasy. Then he clearly told what he wanted for\nthe deliverance of his family. Bhagavan S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a then, addressed Ganga\nand said :-- \xc2\x93O Sures'vari! Go quickly and appear in Bharata, under the curse\nof Bharati. By My command go quickly and purify the sons of Sagara. They will\nall be purified by the touch of the air in contact with the Ganges and rise up\nin divine aerial cars, assuming forms like Mine and they will come to My\nabode. They will there remain always as My attendants and they will not be\ninvolved in the sins that they committed in their previous births. O Narada!\nIt is stated thus in the Vedas, that if the human souls, taking their births\nin Bharata, commit sins for millions and millions of births, the sins will be\ncompletely destroyed if they touch once the air in contact with and carrying\nthe particles of the Ganges. The sight of the Ganges and the touch of the\nGanges water give religious merits ten times more than the touch with the air\nin contact with the Ganges water. People become freed of their sins then and\nthere especially if they bathe in the Ganges. It is heard in the S'rutis that\nthe bathing in the Ganges, if done according to rules, destroys all the sins,\ne.g., the murder of a Brahmi _n_ , etc., acquired in one thousand millions of\nbirths done consciously or unconsciously. The merits that are acquired by the\nbathing in the Ganges on a day of religious merit, cannot be described even by\nthe Vedas. Whatever is mentioned in the \xc3\x82gamas is but a mere trifle. Even\nBrahma, Vi _sn_ u and Mahes'a cannot describe fully the merits of the bathing\nin the Ganges. O Brahmi _n_! Such is the glory of ordinary bathing. Now I will\ndescribe the effect of the Ganges bath done with a Sankalpa (resolve); hear.\nTen times more the result is obtained when the Ganges bathing is done with a\nresolve (Sankalpa) than ordinary bath and if one bathes on the day when the\nsun passes from one sign to another (in the Zodiac), thirty times more\nreligious merits accrue. On the new Moon (Amavyas) day, the Ganges bath gives\nthe merits as above mentioned; but when the Sun is in his Southern course (Dak\n_s_ i _n_ aya _n_ a) double the merits are obtained and when the sun is in his\nNorthern course, ten times more religious merits are obtained. The Ganges\nbathing in the time of Chaturmasya, full Moon day, Ak _s_ aya Navami or Ak _s_\naya trittiya yields merits that cannot be measured. And if on the above Parva\n(particular periods of the year on which certain ceremonies are commanded)\ndays both bathing, and making\n\n\n\np. 848\n\n\n\nover gifts are done, there is no limit to the religious merits acquired;\nhundred times more than ordinary bath, religious merits are obtained. Great\nreligious merits accrue from the Ganges bath on Manvantara tithi, Yugadya,\nS'ukla seventh day of the month of Magha, Bhismastami day, As'okastami day,\nand S\xc2\x92ri Rama Navami day. Again double the merits than those of the above\narise from bathing in the Ganges during the Nanda ceremony. The Gauges bath in\nthe Das'ahara tenth tithi gives merits equivalent to Yugadya Snanam (bath).\nAnd if the bathing be done on Mahananda or in Mahavaru _n_ i day, four times\nmore religious merits accrue. Ten million times more religious merits accrue\nfrom the Ganges bathing on Maha Maha Varu _n_ i day than ordinary bath. The\nGanges bath in the Solar eclipse yields ten times more religious merits than\nin the Lunar eclipse. Again the Snanam in Ardhodaya Yoga yields hundred times\nmore religious merits than that of the (solar) eclipse. Thus saying to Ganga\nbefore Bhagiratha, the Lord of the Devas remained silent. The Devi Ganga with\nher head bowed down with devotion, said :--\n\n\n\n39-42. Ganga said :-- If I am after all, to go to Bharata as Thou commandest\nand under the curse given previously by Bharati, then tell me how I would be\nfreed of the sins that the sinners will cast on me. How long will I have to\nremain there? When, O Lord! Shall I be able to return to the Highest place of\nVi _sn_ u? O Thou, the Inner Self of all! O All Knowing! O Lord! Whatever else\nI desire, Thou knowest them all. So be pleased to instruct me on all these\npoints.\n\n\n\n43-69. Bhagavan S\xc2\x92ri Hari said :-- O Sures'vari! I know all that you desire;\nwhen you will assume the liquid form, the Salt Ocean will be your husband. He\nis My part and you are of the nature of Lak _s_ mi; so the union of the lover\nwith the love stricken in the world will turn out a happy and qualified one.\nOf all the rivers Sarasvati and others in Bharata, that go to mix with the\nocean, you will be the best and highly fortunate of them all. From today you\nwill have to remain in Bharata for a period of five thousand years, under the\ncurse of Bharati. You will be able to enjoy daily and always the pleasures\nwith the Ocean. O Devi! As you are a clever lady, so He is also apt and\nexpert. The inhabitants of Bharata will praise Thee and worship Thee with\ngreat devotion by the stotra which Bhagiratha has composed. He will derive the\nfruit of one horse-sacrifice who will meditate on Thee as per Ka _n_ vas'akha\nand worship, praise and bow down to Thee daily. Even if one utter \xc2\x93Ganga,\xc2\x94\n\xc2\x93Ganga,\xc2\x94 though one is one hundred Yojanas away from the Ganges, one will be\nfreed of all sins and go to Vis _nu_ -loka. Whatever sins will be cast in Thee\nby thousand sinners bathing in Thee will be destroyed by the touch of the\ndevotees of Prakriti Devi. Even if\n\n\n\np. 849\n\n\n\nthousands and thousands of sinners touch the dead bodies and bath in Thee, all\nthose will be destroyed when the Devi Bhaktas,the worshippers of Bhuvanes'vari\nand Maya Vija, will come and touch Thee. O Auspicious One! Thou wilt wash away\nthe sins of the sinners, by Thy stay in Bharata with other best rivers\nSarasvati and others. That will be at once a sacred place of pilgrimage where\nThy glories will be chanted. By the touch of the dust of Thine, the sinner\nwill be at once purified and he will dwell in the Devi-loka (Mani Dvipa) for\nas many years as will be the dust there. All Hail to the Devi Bhuvanes'vari!\nHe who will leave his body on Thy lap with full consciousness and remembering\nMy name, will certainly go to My abode and will remain, as My chief attendant\nfor an infinite period. He will see countless Prakritik Layas (dissolutions of\nthe Universe). Unless a man has collected hordes of religious merits, be\ncannot die in the Ganges; and if he dies on the Ganges he goes to Vaiku _nt_\nha as long as the Sun rises in this world. I get many bodies for him where he\ncan enjoy the fruits of his Karma and I then give him My Svarupya (Form\nresembling Mine) and make him My attendant. If any ignorant man, void of any\nJ\xc3\xb1anam, quits his body by touching merely Thy water, I give him Salokya (place\nin My region) and make him My attendant. Even if one quits one's body in a far\noff place, uttering Thy Name, I give him place in My region for one life time\nof Brahma. And if he remembers Thee with devotion, and quits his mortal coil\nat another place, I give him Sarupya (Form resembling Mine) for a period of\nendless Prakritik Layas. He instantly gets on an aerial car made of jewels and\ngoes with My attendants to the region of Goloka and gets form like Me. Those\nthat worship daily My Mantra, that pass their day eating the remnant of the\nfood offered to Me, they need not have any distinction whether they die in\nTirath or not. They themselves can easily purify the three worlds. Getting on\nthe excellent and best aerial car built of jewels, they go to the region of\nGoloka. O Chaste One! Even if the friends of My devotees, be born in animal\nbirths, they also will be purified by the devotion shown towards Me and\ngetting on a jewelled aerial car will be able to go to Goloka, so diffcult of\naccess. Wherever the Bhaktas may be, if they simply remember Me with devotion,\nthey will become liberated while living by the power of My Bhakti. Thus saying\nto Ganga, Bhagavan S\xc2\x92ri Hari addressed Bhagiratha :-- O Child! Now worship\nGanga Devi with devotion and chant hymns to Her. The pure Bhagirata meditated\nwith devotion as per Kauthuma S'akha and worshipped the Devi and praised Her\nrepeatedly. Then Ganga and Bhagiratha bowed down to S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a and He\ndisappeared at once from their sight.\n\n\n\n70\\. The Devar _s_ i Narada said :-- \xc2\x93O Thou the foremost of the Knowers of\nthe Vedas! How, by what Kuthuma S\xc2\x92akha, the noble King Bhagi-\n\n\n\np. 850\n\n\n\nratha meditated on the Devi Ganga; what stotra did he recite and what was the\nmethod with which he worshipped the Ganges.\n\n\n\n71-75. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! One should first take one's bath, and\nputting on a clean washed clothing should perform one's daily duties. Then one\nshould control oneself and with devotion worship the six Devatas Ga _n_ es\xc2\x92a,\nSun, Fire, Vi _sn_ u, S\xc2\x92iva and S'ivani. Thus one becomes entitled to worship.\nFirst worship is to be given to Ga _n_ es'a for the destruction of obstacles;\nthe Sun is to be next worshipped for health; Fire, for purification; Vi _sn_ u\nis then worshipped for getting wealth and power; S\xc2\x92iva is worshipped for\nknowledge and S'ivani is worshipped for Mukti. When these Devatas are\nworshipped, one is entitled to worship the Deity. Otherwise contrary become\nthe effects. Now I am saying what Dhya _n_ am (meditation) did Bhagiratha\npractise towards the Devi Ganga .\n\n\n\nHere ends the Eleventh Chapter of the Ninth Book on the origin of the Ganges\nin the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_\ni Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 12](bk09ch12.htm)\n\n"
