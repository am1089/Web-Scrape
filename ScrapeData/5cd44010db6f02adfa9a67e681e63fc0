He (the Adhvaryu) now utters his call for the Pravara (choosing of\nthe Hot _ri_ ) 2. The reason why he utters his call, is that the (Adhvaryu\'s)\ncall is\n\np. 132\n\nthe sacrifice: \'having bespoke the sacrifice, I will choose the Hot _ri_ ,\'\nthus (he thinks, and) for this reason he utters his call for the Pravara.\n\n1:5:1:22\\. He utters his call after taking the fuel-band; for if the Adhvaryu\nwere to utter his call without taking hold of the sacrifice, he would either\nbe unsteady or meet with some other ailment.\n\n1:5:1:33\\. Here now some utter the call after taking sacrificial grass\n(barhis) from the covered altar, or they utter the call after cutting off and\ntaking a chip of fire-wood, arguing, \'this, surely, is something belonging to\nthe sacrifice; after taking hold of this, the sacrifice, we will utter the\ncall.\' Let him, however, not do this; for that also wherewith the firewood was\ntied together and wherewith they sweep the fire 1 is, doubtless, something\nbelonging to the sacrifice; and thus indeed he utters his call after taking\nhold of the sacrifice: for this reason let him utter the call after taking the\nfuel-band.\n\n1:5:1:44\\. Having uttered the call, he in the first place chooses him who is\nthe Hot _ri_ of the gods, that is, Agni. Thereby he propitiates both Agni and\nthe gods: for by first choosing Agni, he propitiates Agni;\n\np. 133\n\nand by first choosing him who is the Hot _ri_ of the gods, he propitiates the\ngods.\n\n1:5:1:55\\. He says, \'Agni, the god, the divine Hot _ri_ \\--,\' for Agni is\nindeed the Hot _ri_ of the gods, therefore he says \'Agni, the god, the divine\nHot _ri_ :\' thereby he propitiates both Agni and the gods; for by his first\nmentioning Agni he propitiates Agni; and by his first mentioning him who is\nthe Hot _ri_ of the gods, he propitiates the gods.\n\n1:5:1:66\\. \'May he worship, knowing the gods 1, he the thoughtful one,\'--for\nhe, Agni, indeed, knows the gods well: hence, he thereby says \'may he who\nknows them well worship (them) in due form!\n\n1:5:1:77\\. \'Like as Manu (did), like as Bharata;\'--Manu, indeed, worshipped\nwith sacrifice in olden times, and doing as he did these descendants of his\nnow sacrifice: therefore he says \'like as Manu.\' Or, say they, (it means) \'at\nthe sacrifice of Manu,\' and therefore he says \'as (he did) with Manu.\'\n\n1:5:1:88\\. \'Like as (with) Bharata,\'--for, say they, he bears (bhar) the\noblation to the gods, hence Bharata (the bearer) is Agni; or, say they, he,\nhaving become the breath, supports (bhar) these creatures, and therefore he\nsays \'like as Bharata.\'\n\n1:5:1:99\\. He then chooses (Agni as) the ancestral (Hot _ri_ ). He thus\nintroduces him both to the (ancestral) _ri_ shis and to the gods (as if he\nwere saying), \'he is of mighty strength who obtained the sacrifice!\' for this\nreason he chooses (him as) the ancestral one.\n\n1:5:1:1010\\. He chooses from the remote end (of the sacrificer\'s ancestral\nline) 2 downwards; for it is from the\n\np. 134\n\nremote end downwards that a race is propagated. Thereby he also propitiates\nthe lord of seniority; for here among men the father comes first, then the\nson, and then the grandson: this is the reason why he chooses from the remote\nend downwards.\n\n1:5:1:1111\\. Having named the ancestral, he says, \'Like as, Brahman;\'--for\nAgni is the Brahman (the Veda, or the sacerdotium), and therefore he says\n\'like as Brahman;\'--\'may he bring (the gods) hither!\' what deities he bids him\nbring hither, those he refers to in saying \'may he bring (them) hither.\'\n\n1:5:1:1212\\. \'The Brahma _n_ as (priests) are the guardians of this\nsacrifice;\' for guardians of the sacrifice, indeed, are those Brahma _n_ as\nwho are versed in the sacred writ, because they spread it, they originate it:\nthese he thereby propitiates; and for this reason he says, \'the Brahma _n_ as\nare the guardians of the sacrifice.\'\n\n1:5:1:1313\\. \'N.N. is the man,\' thereby he chooses this man for his Hot _ri_ ;\nheretofore he was not a Hot _ri_ , but now he is a Hot _ri_.\n\n1:5:1:1414\\. The chosen Hot _ri_ mutters,--has recourse to the deities: in\norder that he may give the vasha _t_ -call to the gods in its proper order,\nthat he may convey the oblation to the gods in its proper order, that he may\nnot stumble, he has thus recourse to the deities.\n\n1:5:1:1515\\. He mutters on this occasion 1, \'Thee, O divine Savit _ri_ , they\nnow choose,\'--thereby he has recourse to Savit _ri_ for his impulsion\n(prasava), for Savit _ri_ is the impeller (prasavit _ri_ ) of the\ngods;--\'(thee who art) Agni, for the Hot _ri_ ship,\' thereby he\n\np. 135\n\npropitiates both Agni and the gods; for by first naming Agni, he propitiates\nAgni; and by first naming him who is the Hot _ri_ of the gods, he propitiates\nthe gods.\n\n1:5:1:1616\\. \'Together with father Vai _s_ vanara,\'--for the father Vai _s_\nvanara (\'common to all men\'), doubtless, is the year, is Pra _g_ apati (lord\nof creatures); hence he thereby propitiates the year and thus Pra _g_\napati.--\'O Agni! O Pushan! O B _ri_ haspati! speak forth and offer up\nsacrifice (pra-ya _g_ )!\'--he (the Hot _ri_ ), namely, will have to recite the\nanuvakyas and the yagyas 1; he therefore now propitiates those gods: do ye\nrecite, \'do ye offer!\' thus (he thereby says).\n\n1:5:1:1717\\. \'May we partake of the bounty of the Vasus, of the wide sway of\nthe Rudras! may we be beloved of the \xc3\x82dityas for the sake of (aditi) security\nfrom injury, free from obstruction!\'--these, to wit, the Vasus, Rudras, and\n\xc3\x82dityas, namely, are three (classes of) gods: \'may we enjoy their protection\'\nhe thereby says.\n\n1:5:1:1818\\. \'May I this day utter speech that is agreeable to the gods;\'--by\nthis he means to say \'may I this day recite what is agreeable to the gods,\'\nfor auspicious it is when one recites what is agreeable to the gods.\n\n1:5:1:1919\\. \'Agreeable to the Brahmans,\'--by this he means to say \'may I this\nday recite what is agreeable to the Brahma _n_ as (priests);\' for auspicious\nit is when one recites what is agreeable to the Brahma _n_ as.\n\np. 136\n\n1:5:1:2020\\. \'Agreeable to Nara _s_ a _m_ sa 1,\'--man (nara), namely, is a\ncreature: hence he says this for all the creatures; thereby it is auspicious,\nand whether or not he knows (forms of speech that are agreeable), they are\nuttered (and received with applause), \'well he has recited! well he has\nrecited!\'--\'What at the Hot _ri_ choice may escape the crooked eye this day,\nthat may Agni bring back here, he, the knower of beings ( _g_ atavedas), the\nnimble one (vi _k_ arsha _n_ i)!\'--by this he means to say, \'even as those\n(three) Agnis, whom they first chose for the Hot _ri_ ship, passed away 2,\n(but thou, the fourth Agni, wast then obtained,) so do thou make good for me\nwhatever mistake may have been committed at my election!\' and it is\naccordingly made good for him.\n\n1:5:1:2121\\. He now touches the Adhvaryu and the \xc3\x82gnidhra: for the Adhvaryu is\nthe mind, and the Hot _ri_ is, speech: thus he thereby brings mind and speech\ntogether.\n\n1:5:1:2222\\. At the same time he mutters 3, \'From anguish may the six spaces\nprotect me, fire, earth, water, wind, day, and night 4!\'--\'may these deities\nprotect\n\np. 137\n\nme from disease!\' thus he thereby says; for he whom these deities protect from\ndisease, will not stumble (or fail).\n\n1:5:1:2323\\. He steps beside the Hot _ri_ \'s seat, takes one stalk of (reed)\ngrass from the Hot _ri_ \'s seat and casts it outside (the sacrificial ground),\nwith the formula, \'Ejected is the wealth-clutcher (paravasu, lit. "off-\nwealth")!\' Formerly, namely, the Hot _ri_ of the Asuras was one Paravasu by\nname: him he thereby ejects from the Hot _ri_ \'s seat.\n\n1:5:1:2424\\. He then sits down on the Hot _ri_ \'s seat, with the formula, \'I\nhere sit down on the seat of the wealth-bestower (arvavasu, lit. "hither-\nwealth")!\' for one Arvavasu by name was the Hot _ri_ of the gods 1, and on his\nseat he accordingly sits down.\n\n1:5:1:2525\\. At the same time he mutters, \'O All-maker, thou art the protector\nof lives! do not ye two (fires) scorch me away (from this) 2, injure me not!\nthis\n\np. 138\n\nis your sphere;\' with this he moves slightly northwards: by this (mantra, he\nindicates that) he sits midway between the \xc3\x82havaniya and the Garhapatya, and\nthus he propitiates these two; and in accordance with what he says, \'do not\nscorch me away from this! injure me not!\' they do not injure him.\n\n1:5:1:2626\\. He then mutters whilst looking at the (\xc3\x82havaniya) fire, \'All ye\ngods, instruct me, how and what I am to mind while seated here as the chosen\nHot _ri_! declare my share (of the sacrificial duties), how and by what road I\nam to convey the oblation to you!\'--for as one says to those for whom food has\nbeen cooked, \'order me how I am to bring if you, how I am to serve it up for\nyou!\' in like manner he is desirous of directions regarding the gods, and for\nthis reason he mutters thus, \'instruct me how I may utter the Vasha _t_ -call\nfor you in its proper order, how I may bring you the oblation in its proper\norder!\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[131:2](sbe1222.htm#fr_331) The Hot _ri_ , on concluding the invitation of the\ngods, sits down with raised knees in the same place where he has been standing\n(see [p. 95](sbe1216.htm#page_95), note [1](sbe1216.htm#fn_263)), parts the\nsacrificial grass of the altar, and measures a span on the earth, with the\ntext (\xc3\x82 _s_ v. I, 3, 22), \'Aditi is his mother, do not cut him off from the\nair. With the aid of p. 132 Agni, the god, the deity; with the threefold\nchant, with the rathantara-saman, with the gayatri metre, with the agnish _t_\noma sacrifice, with the vasha _t_ -call, the thunderbolt,--I here kill him who\nhates us, and whom we hate!\' The Adhvaryu having thereupon walked round the\nHot _ri_ from left to right, steps behind the utkara (heap of rubbish) with\nhis face to the east and the fuel-band in his hand, and calls on (a _s_\nravayati) the \xc3\x82gnidhra, with \xc3\x95 _s_ ravaya (or \xc3\x95 _m_ _s_ ravaya, i.e. a _s_\nravaya; or simply \' _s_ ravaya;\' cf. Saya _n_ a on Taitt. S. I, 6, 11). The\n\xc3\x82gnidhra (whilst standing north of the Adhvaryu, with his face to the south,\nand taking the wooden sword and the fuel-band from the Adhvaryu) responds\n(pratya _s_ ravayati) by \'astu _s_ rausha _t_.\'\n\n[132:1](sbe1222.htm#fr_332) See [p. 127](sbe1220.htm#page_127), note\n[1](sbe1221.htm#fn_321).\n\n[133:1](sbe1222.htm#fr_333) Thus our author. It should rather be \'May (he)\nworship the gods, he the wise, the considerate one.\'\n\n[133:2](sbe1222.htm#fr_334) Cf. [p. 115](sbe1218.htm#page_115), note\n[1](sbe1218.htm#fn_303).\n\n[134:1](sbe1222.htm#fr_335) Except the beginning, these formulas are entirely\ndifferent from those given by \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_. I, 3, 23-24.\n\n[135:1](sbe1222.htm#fr_336) The ya _g_ yas (offering-prayers) are the prayers\nwhich the Hot _ri_ pronounces when the offerings are poured into the fire\n(this being done simultaneously with, or immediately after, the van shat, \'may\nhe carry it,\' with which the ya _g_ ya ends, is pronounced). At the chief\noblations the offering-prayer is preceded by an anuvakya or puro \'nuvakya\n(invitatory prayer) by which the gods are invited to come to the offering, and\nwhich ends with \'om.\'\n\n[136:1](sbe1222.htm#fr_337) Nara _s_ a _m_ sa [\'the hope or desire (a _s_ a\n_m_ sa) of man (nara)\'] is a mystical form of Agni, invoked chiefly in the\n\xc3\x82pri-hymns at animal sacrifices. \'Yatha sarve \'pi nara a sarvata _h_ samsanti\ntathavidhaya.\' Saya _n_ a.\n\n[136:2](sbe1222.htm#fr_338) See the legend I, 2, 3, 1 seq.\n\n[136:3](sbe1222.htm#fr_339) This and the succeeding formulas also are entirely\ndifferent from those given in \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_. I, 3, 27 seq. The Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khay. _S_. I,\n6 (Hillebrandt, Neu and Vollm. p. 91) seems to coincide, to some extent, with\nthose given by our author.\n\n[136:4](sbe1222.htm#fr_340) The six spaces or wide expanses (urvi) are several\ntimes referred to in Vedic texts, but the conception seems to have been very\nvague. They are generally supposed to include the space above, the space\nbelow, and the four quarters. In Rig-veda VI, 47, 3-5 it is stated that they\nhave been measured out p. 137 by Indra, and that outside of them there is no\nbeing (bhuvanam); and they are then enumerated thus: the expanse of the earth,\nthe height (varshman,? highest point or sphere) of the sky (div), the sap\n(piyusha) in the three elevations [? i.e. flowing, animating moisture, as\nrain, rivers, sap, &c.], the atmosphere, the ocean (? ar _n_ as,? of light,\nair), and the sky (div). The enumeration of six objects in Atharva-veda II,\n12, 1 seems to refer to the same conception: heaven and earth (dyavap _ri_\nthivi), the wide atmospheric region, the genius (fem.) of the field\n(kshetrasya patni), the far-strider (Sun, Light), the wide atmospheric region\n(uru-antariksham as before; cf. the double enumeration of div in the _Ri_ k\npassage); and what has the Wind for its guardian (vatagopa). Cf. Weber, Ind:\nStud. XIII, p. 164. Sa _n_ kb. G _ri_ hya-sutra I, 6, 4 gives heaven and\nearth, day and night, water and plants (St. Petersburg Dictionary s.v.).\n\n[137:1](sbe1222.htm#fr_341) According to the Kaushit. Br. VI, 10, Arvavasu was\nthe Brahman of the gods. Weber, Ind. Stud. II, 306.\n\n[137:2](sbe1222.htm#fr_342) The Hot _ri_ \'s seat stands north of the north-\nwest corner of the altar, the \xc3\x82havaniya and the Garhapatya fires being about\nequidistant from it towards south-east and south-west respectively.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 5, 2.
