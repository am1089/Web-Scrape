Agni being kindled, set down on the earth, has stood up with his face\ntowards all worlds. May the Hot _ri_ , the purifier, the ancient, wise one,\nmay god Agni sacrifice to the gods, he who is worthy (of being the\nsacrificer).\n\n2\\. Nara _s_ a _m_ sa, anointing the abodes (of the sacrifice), equal by his\ngreatness to the three heavens, endowed with beautiful light, moistening the\noffering, his mind being intent on scattering gh _ri_ ta--may he anoint the\ngods on the summit of sacrifice.\n\n3\\. Being magnified [1](sbe46053.htm#an_2:3:3:1) in our mind, Agni, sacrifice\nfor us to-day to the gods before the human (sacrificer)\n[2](sbe46053.htm#an_2:3:3:2), thou who art worthy (of being the sacrificer).\nConduct hither the unshakable host of the Maruts. Sacrifice, O men, to Indra\nwho sits on the Barhis.\n\n4\\. O divine Barhis! On this (Barhis) which is large, rich in valiant men,\nwhich has been spread on this Vedi (or sacrificial altar) rich in gain, ready\nfor wealth, which is anointed with gh _ri_ ta, sit down, O Vasus, O Vi _s_ ve\ndevas, O \xc3\x82dityas [1](sbe46053.htm#an_2:3:4:1) worthy of worship!\n\n5\\. May the divine doors which are easily passable, open themselves wide when\ninvoked with adoration. May they, the far-embracing, undecaying ones, open\nwide, purifying our glorious race [1](sbe46053.htm#an_2:3:5:1) which is rich\nin valiant men.\n\n6\\. May Dawn and Night, grown strong from of\n\np. 199\n\nold, joyful like two birds (?) [1](sbe46053.htm#an_2:3:6:1), (do) their work\nwell for us--they who weave, turned towards each other, the stretched-out\nwarp, the ornamented form of the sacrifice [2](sbe46053.htm#an_2:3:6:2), (the\ntwo goddesses) flowing with plenty, rich in milk.\n\n7\\. May the two divine Hot _ri_ s, the first ones, very knowing, very\nmarvellous, perform the sacrifice rightly with their (sacrificial) verse.\nSacrificing to the gods they anoint (them) [1](sbe46053.htm#an_2:3:7:1),\nobserving the right time, on the navel of the Earth, over the three ridges (of\nthe three worlds).\n\n8\\. May Sarasvati, the accomplisher of our prayer, may the goddess I _l_ a,\nall-victorious Bharati--may the three goddesses, according to their wont, sit\ndown on this Barhis and protect it, the faultless shelter.\n\n9\\. Through (the god's) hearing (our prayer) a manly son is born (to us),\ntawny-coloured, rich in gain, bringing vigour, loving the gods. May Tvash _t_\n_ri_ deliver for us a son, the navel (i. e. the tie that binds generations\ntogether), and may he then go to the abode of the gods.\n\n10 [1](sbe46053.htm#an_2:3:10:1). May the tree (i. e. the sacrificial post)\nstand by, letting loose (the offering which goes to the gods). May Agni make\nthe offering ready in consequence of our prayers. May the prescient divine\nbutcher carry the thrice-anointed offering to the gods.\n\n11\\. He [1](sbe46053.htm#an_2:3:11:1) is joined with gh _ri_ ta\n[2](sbe46053.htm#an_2:3:11:2). His womb (on the altar) is gh _ri_ ta. He rests\non gh _ri_ ta. His abode is gh _ri_ ta. Carry hither (the gods) according to\nthy wont! Rejoice [3](sbe46053.htm#an_2:3:11:3)! Carry, O bull, the offering,\nover which the Svaha has been spoken, (to the gods).\n\np. 200\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi. Metre, Trish _t_ ubh; verse 7: _G_ agati.--Verse 9 = TS.\nIII, 1, 11, 2; TB. II, 8, 7, 4; MS. IV, 14, 8. Verse 11 = VS. XVII, 88; T\xc3\x82. X,\n10, 2.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. The text has i _li_ ta _h_. Comp. above, I, 1, 1, note 2.\n\nNote 2. Comp. X, 53, I. ni hi satsat (scil. agni _h_ ) antara _h_ pu\xc2\xb4rva _h_\nasmat.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. It is very probable that the poet intends to distinguish the Vasus,\nthe Vi _s_ ve devas, and the \xc3\x82dityas as three categories of gods. But then we\nshould expect the accent a\xc2\xb4ditya _h_. Comp. VII, 51, 3. aditya\xc2\xb4 _h_ vi _s_ ve\nmaruta _h_ _k_ a vi _s_ ve deva\xc2\xb4 _h_ _k_ a vi _s_ ve; X, 125, 1. aham rudrebhi\n_h_ vasubhi _h_ _k_ arami aham a\xc2\xb4dityai _h_ uta vi _s_ vadevai _h_.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Comp. the G _ri_ hya Mantra addressed to the Mekhala, of which it is\nsaid 'var _n_ am pavitram punati na _h_ agat,' _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana G _ri_ hya II, 2,\n1, &c.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. The meaning of vayy\xcc\x83a (comp. IX; 68, 8) is uncertain. Possibly it is\nderived from vi, 'the bird.' According to Saya _n_ a it would mean 'weavers'\n(vanaku _s_ ale iva). Vayy\xcc\x83eva may be vayy\xcc\x83e iva (dual feminine), in spite of\nthe artificial theory of the Prag _ri_ hya vowels; see Lanman, p. 361; H. O.,\nHymnen des Rig-veda, I, 456. Or it may be vayy\xcc\x83a iva, dual masculine or\nsingular feminine (comp. VII, 2, 6).\n\nNote 2. Comp. VII, 42, 1. adhvarasya pe _s_ a _h_.\n\np. 201\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. Comp. VIII, 39, 1. agni _h_ deva\xc2\xb4n anaktu na _h_.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. With the first hemistich compare especially, III, 4, 10 (see below).\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. 'He' of course is Agni.\n\nNote 2. Differing from M. M., vol. xxxii, p. 185, I take gh _ri_ tam as an\naccusative.\n\nNote 3. Comp. III, 6, 9 (see below).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 4](sbe46054.htm)\n\n"
