Together with the B _ri_\nhad-ara _n_ yaka, which belongs to the Ya _g_ ur-veda, it has contributed the\nmost important materials to what may be called the orthodox philosophy of\nIndia, the Vedanta 1, i.e. the end, the purpose, the highest object of the\nVeda. It consists of eight adhyayas or lectures, and formed part of a _Kh_\nandogya-brahma _n_ a, in which it was preceded by two other adhyayas. While\nMSS. of the _Kh_ andogya-upanishad and its commentary are frequent, no MSS. of\nthe whole Brahma _n_ a has been met with in Europe. Several scholars had\nactually doubted its existence, but Rajendralal Mitra 2, in the Introduction\nto his translation of the _Kh_ andogya-upanishad, states that in India \'MSS.\nof the work are easily available, though as yet he has seen no commentary\nattached to the Brahma _n_ a portion of any one of them.\' \'According to\ngeneral acceptation,\'\n\np. lxxxvii\n\nhe adds, \'the work embraces ten chapters, of which the first two are reckoned\nto be the Brahma _n_ a, and the rest is known under the name of _Kh_ andogya-\nupanishad. In their arrangement and style the two portions differ greatly, and\njudged by them they appear to be productions of very different ages, though\nboth are evidently relics of pretty remote antiquity. Of the two chapters of\nthe _Kh_ andogya-brahma _n_ a 1, the first includes eight suktas (hymns) on\nthe ceremony of marriage, and the rites necessary to be observed at the birth\nof a child. The first suktas is intended to be recited when offering an\noblation to Agni on the occasion of a marriage, and its object is to pray for\nprosperity in behalf of the married couple. The second prays for long life,\nkind relatives, and a numerous progeny. The third is the marriage pledge by\nwhich the contracting parties bind themselves to each other. Its spirit may be\nguessed from a single verse. In talking of the unanimity with which they will\ndwell, the bridegroom addresses his bride, "That heart of thine shall be mine,\nand this heart of mine shall be thine 2." The fourth and the fifth invoke\nAgni, Vayu, _K_ andramas, and Surya to bless the couple and ensure healthful\nprogeny. The sixth is a mantra for offering an oblation on the birth of a\nchild; and the seventh and the eighth are prayers for its being healthy,\nwealthy, and powerful, not weak, poor, or mute, and to ensure a profusion of\nwealth and milch-cows. The first sukta of the second chapter is addressed to\nthe Earth, Agni, and Indra, with a prayer for wealth, health, and prosperity;\nthe second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth are mantras for offering oblations\nto cattle, the manes, Surya, and divers minor deities. The seventh is a curse\nupon worms, insects, flies, and other nuisances, and the last, the concluding\nmantra of the marriage ceremony, in which a general blessing is invoked for\nall concerned.\'\n\nAfter this statement there can be but little doubt that\n\np. lxxxviii\n\nthis Upanishad originally formed part of a Brahma _n_ a. This may have been\ncalled either by a general name, the Brahma _n_ a of the _Kh_ andogas, the\nfollowers of the Sama-veda, or, on account of the prominent place occupied in\nit by the Upanishad, the Upanishad-brahma _n_ a 1. In that case it would be\none of the eight Brahma _n_ as of the Sama-veda, enumerated by Kumarila Bha\n_t_ _t_ a and others 2, and called simply Upanishad, scil. Brahma _n_ a.\n\nThe text of the Upanishad with the commentary of _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara and the gloss of\n\xc3\x82nandagiri has been published in the Bibliotheca Indica. The edition can only\nclaim the character of a manuscript, and of a manuscript not always very\ncorrectly read.\n\nA translation of the Upanishad was published, likewise in the Bibliotheca\nIndica, by Rajendralal Mitra.\n\nIt is one of the Upanishads that was translated into Persian under the\nauspices of Dara Shukoh 3, and from Persian into French by Anquetil Duperron,\nin his Oupnekhat, i.e. Secretum Tegendum. Portions of it were translated into\nEnglish by Colebrooke in his Miscellaneous Essays, into Latin and German by F.\nW. Windischmann, in his _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, seu de theologumenis Vedanticorum. (Bonn,\n1833), and in a work published by his father, K. J. H. Windischmann, Die\nPhilosophie im Fortgang der Weltgeschichte (Bonn, 1827-34). Professor A. Weber\nhas treated of this Upanishad in his Indische Studien I, 254; likewise M. P.\nRegnaud in his Materiaux pour servir a l\'histoire dc la philosophie de l\'Inde\n(Paris, 1876) and Mr. Gough in several articles on \'the Philosophy of the\nUpanishads,\' in the Calcutta Review, No. CXXXI.\n\nI have consulted my predecessors whenever there was a serious difficulty to\nsolve in the translation of these ancient texts. These difficulties are very\nnumerous, as those know\n\np. lxxxix\n\nbest who have attempted to give complete translations of these ancient texts.\nIt will be seen that my translation differs sometimes very considerably from\nthose of my predecessors. Though I have but seldom entered into any\ncontroversy with them, they may rest assured that I have not deviated from\nthem without careful reflection.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[lxxxvi:1](sbe01017.htm#fr_46) Vedanta, as a technical term, did not mean\noriginally the last portions of the Veda, or chapters placed, as it were, at\nthe end of a volume of Vedic literature, but the end, i. e. the object, the\nhighest purpose of the Veda. There are, of course, passages, like the one in\nthe Taittiriya-ara _n_ yaka (ed. Rajendralal Mitra, p. 820), which have been\nmisunderstood both by native and European scholars, and where vedanta means\nsimply the end of the Veda:--yo vedadau svara _h_ prokto vedante ka pratish\n_th_ ita _h_ , \'the Om which is pronounced at the beginning of the Veda, and\nhas its place also at the end of the Veda.\' Here vedanta stands simply in\nopposition to vedadau, and it is impossible to translate it, as Saya _n_ a\ndoes, by Vedanta or Upanishad. Vedanta, in the sense of philosophy, occurs in\nthe Taittiriya-ara _n_ yaka (p. 817), in a verse of the Naraya _n_ iya-\nupanishad, repeated in the Mundaka-upanishad III, 2, 6, and elsewhere,\nvedantavi _g_ \xc3\xb1anasuni _s_ _k_ itara _h_ , \'those who have well understood the\nobject of the knowledge arising from the Vedanta,\' not \'from the last books of\nthe Veda;\' and Svetasvatara-up. VI, 22, vedante parama _m_ guhyam, \'the\nhighest mystery in the Vedanta.\' Afterwards it is used in the plural also, e.\ng. Kshurikopanishad, 10 (Bibl. Ind. p. 210), pu _n_ _d_ ariketi vedanteshu\nnigadyate, \'it is called pu _n_ _d_ arika in the Vedantas,\' i. e. in the _Kh_\nandogya and other Upanishads, as the commentator says, but not in the last\nbooks of each Veda. A curious passage is found in the Gautama-sutras XIX, 12,\nwhere a distinction seems to be made between Upanishad and Vedanta.
