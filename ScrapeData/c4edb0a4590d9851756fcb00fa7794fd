As he drew nigh he\nheard a voice crying over and over again from the midst of the sacred flames:\n"Hasten, Nala! Oh, hasten, Nala, and come hither!"\n\nNow, Agni had given Nala power over fire, so crying: "Have no fear," he leapt\nthrough the flames. . . . In the space within that blazing circle be beheld\nthe king of serpents lying coiled up in a ring with folded hands and unable to\nmove. 1 Lo! I am Karkotaka," the serpent said, "and am suffering this\npunishment because that I deceived the holy sage Narada, who thereupon cursed\nme, saying: \'Thou wilt remain here in the midst of the flames until Nala\ncometh nigh to free thee from my curse\'. . . . So do I lie without power to\nmove. O mighty rajah, if thou wilt rescue me even now, I will reward thee\nabundantly with my noble friendship, and help thee to attain great\n\np. 354\n\nhappiness. Oh lift me all speedily from out of this fiery place, thou noble\nrajah!"\n\nWhen he had spoken thus, Karkotaka, king of the serpents, shrank to the size\nof a man\'s finger, whereupon Nala uplifted and carried him safely through the\nflames to a cool and refreshing space without.\n\nThe serpent then said: "Now walk on and count thy steps, so that good fortune\nmay be assured to thee."\n\nNala walked nine steps, but ere he could take the tenth the serpent bit him,\nwhereat the rajah was suddenly transformed into a misshapen dwarf with short\narms.\n\nThen Karkotaka said: "Know now that I have thus changed thy form so that no\nman may know thee. My poison, too, will cause unceasing anguish to the evil\none who possesseth thy soul; he will suffer greatly until he shall set thee\nfree from thy sorrow. So wilt thou be delivered from thine enemy, O blameless\none. . . . My poison will harm thee not, and henceforth, by reason of my\npower, thou wilt have no need to fear the wild boar, or any foeman, or a\nBrahman, or the sages. Ever in battle thou wilt be victorious. . . . Now, go\nthy way, and be called \'Vahuka, the charioteer\'. Hasten thou unto the city of\nAyodhya 1 and enter the service of the royal Rajah Rituparna, the skilful in\ndice. Thou wilt teach him how to subdue horses, and he will impart to thee the\nsecret of dice. Then wilt thou again have joy. Sorrow not, therefore, for thy\nwife and thy children will be restored unto thee, and thou wilt regain thy\nkingdom."\n\nThen the serpent gave unto Nala a magic robe, saying: "When it is thy desire\nto be as thou wert, O king, think of me and put on this garment, and thou wilt\nimmediately resume thy wonted form."\n\np. 355\n\nHaving spoken thus, the king of serpents vanished from sight. Thereupon Nala\nwent towards the city of Ayodhya, and he stood in the presence of the royal\nRajah Rituparna, unto whom he spoke thus: "My name is Vahuka. I am a tamer of\nsteeds, nor is my equal to be found in the world; and I have surpassing skill\nin cooking viands."\n\nThe rajah welcomed him and took him into his service, saying: "Thou shalt\ncause my horses to be fleet of foot. Be thou master of mine own steed, and thy\nreward will be great."\n\nHe was well pleased and gave unto Vahuka for comrades Varshneya, who had been\nin Nala\'s service, and Jivala also. So the transformed rajah abode a long time\nat Ayodhya, and every evening, sitting alone, he sang a single verse:\n\nWhere is she all worn but faithful, weary, thirsty, hung\'ring too?  \nThinks she of her foolish husband? . . . Doth another man her woo?\n\nEver thus he sang, and his comrades heard him and wondered greatly. So it came\nthat one evening Jivala spoke to Nala and said: "For whom do you sorrow thus,\nO Vahuka? I pray you to tell me. Who is the husband of this lady?"\n\nNala answered him with sad voice and said: "Once there was a peerless lady,\nand she had a husband of weakly will. And lo.! as they wandered in a forest\ntogether, he fled from her without cause, and yet he sorrowed greatly. Ever by\nday and by night is he consumed by his overwhelming grief, and brooding ever,\nhe sings this melancholy song. He is a weary wanderer in the wide world, and\nhis sorrow is without end; it is never still. . . . His wife wanders all\nforlorn in\n\np. 356\n\nthe forest. Ah! she deserved not such a fate. Thirsting and anhungered she\nwanders alone because her lord forsook her and fled; wild beasts are about\nher, seeking to devour; the wood is full of perils. . . . It may be that she\nis not now alive. . . ."\n\nThus did Nala sorrow in his secret heart over Damayanti during his long\nsojourn at Ayodhya, while he served the renowned Rajah Rituparna.\n\nMeanwhile King Bhima was causing search to be made for his lost daughter and\nher royal husband. Abundant rewards were offered to Brahmans, who went through\nevery kingdom and every city in quest of the missing pair. It chanced that a\nBrahman, named Sudeva, entered Chedi when a royal holiday was being\ncelebrated, and he beheld Damayanti standing beside the Princess Sunanda and\nthe queen mother at the royal palace.\n\nSudeva perceived that her loveliness had been dimmed by sorrow, and to himself\nhe said as he gazed upon her: "Ah! the lady with lotus eyes is like to the\nmoon, darkly beautiful; her splendour hath shrunken like the crescent moon\nveiled in cloud--she who aforetime was beheld in the full moonlight of her\nglory. Pining for her lost husband, she is like to a darksome night when the\nmoon is swallowed; her sorrow hath stricken her like to a river which has\nbecome dry, like to a shrunken pool in which lotus blooms shrivel and fade;\nshe is, indeed, like to withered lotus. . . . Doth Nala live now without the\nbride who thus mourns for him? . . . When, oh when shall Damayanti be restored\nonce again unto her lord as the moon bride is restored unto the peerless moon?\n1 . . . Methinks I will speak. . . ."\n\np. 357\n\nThe Brahman then approached Damayanti and said: "I am Sudeva. Thy royal sire\nand thy mother and thy children are well. . . . A hundred Brahmans have been\nsent forth throughout the world to search for thee, O noble lady."\n\nDamayanti heard him and wept.\n\nThe Princess Sunanda spoke to her queen mother, saying: "Lo! our handmaid\nweeps because that the Brahman hath spoken unto her. . . . Who she is we shall\nspeedily know now."\n\nThen the queen mother conducted the holy man to her chambers and spoke to him,\nsaying: "Who is she--this mysterious and noble stranger, O holy man?"\n\nSudeva spoke in answer: "Her name is Damayanti, and her sire is King Bhima,\nlord of Vidarbha. Her husband is Nala. . . . From birth she has had a dark\nbeauty spot like to a lotus between her fair eyebrows. Although it is covered\nwith dust, I perceived it, and so I knew her. By Brahma was this spot made as\nthe sign of his beauty-creating power."\n\nThe queen mother bade Sudeva to remove the dust from the beauty spot of\nBhima\'s daughter. When this was done, it came forth like to the unclouded moon\nin heaven, and the royal lady and her daughter wept together and embraced the\nfair Damayanti 1.\n\nThen the queen mother said: "Lo! thou art mine own sister\'s daughter, O\nbeauteous one. Our sire is the Rajah Sudaman who reigns at Dasarna 2. . . .\nOnce I beheld thee as a child. . . . Ah! ask of me whatsoever thou desirest\nand it shall be thine."\n\np. 358\n\n"Alas! I am a banished mother," Damayanti said with fast-flowing tears.\n"Permit me, therefore, to return unto my children who have been orphaned of\nmother and sire."\n\nThe queen mother said: "Be it so."\n\nThen Damayanti was given an army to guard her on her journey towards her\nnative city, and she was welcomed there by all her kindred and friends with\ngreat rejoicing. King Bhima rewarded Sudeva with a thousand kine, and a town\'s\nrevenue for a village. 1\n\nWhen Damayanti was embraced by her mother she said: "Now our chief duty is to\nbring home Nala."\n\nThe queen wept, and spoke to her husband, the royal Bhima, saying: "Our\ndaughter still mourns heavily for lost lord and cannot be comforted."\n\nThen Bhima urged the Brahmans to search for Nala, offering munificent reward\nwhen that he should be found. Damayanti addressed these holy men ere they\ndeparted and said unto them: "Wheresoever thou goest, speak this my message\nover and over again:\n\n" _Whither art thou gone, O gambler, who didst sever my garment in twain? Thou\ndidst leave thy loved one as she lay slumbering in the savage wood. Lo! she is\nawaiting thy return: by day and by night she sitteth alone, consumed by her\ngrief. Oh hear her prayer and have compassion, thou noble hero, because that\nsize ever weepeth for thee in the depths of her despair!_ "\n\nSo the holy men went through every kingdom and every city repeating the\nmessage of Damayanti over and over again; but when they began to return one by\none, each told with sadness that his quest had been in vain.\n\np. 359\n\nThen came unto Vidarbha that Brahman, the wise Parnada, who had sojourned a\ntime in the city of Ayodhya. He addressed the daughter of Bhima, saying: "Unto\nRituparna I spake regarding thy husband, repeating thy message, but he\nanswered not a word. So I went out from before him. Thereafter there came to\nme his charioteer, a man with short arms and misshapen body. His name is\nVahuka, and he is skilled in driving the swift chariot and in preparing\nviands. He sorrowed greatly, and with melancholy voice spoke unto me these\nwords:\n\n\' _In the excess of her sorrow a noble woman will compose herself and remain\nconstant, and so win heaven by her virtues. She is protected by the\nbreastplate of her chastity, and will suffer no harm. Nor will she yield to\nanger although she be deserted by her lord, whose robe the birds have taken\naway, leaving him in sore distress. She will not be moved to wrath against her\nhusband, the sorrow-stricken and famine-wasted, who hath been bereft of his\nkingdom and despoiled of happiness_.\'\n\nWhen I heard the stranger\'s speech I came speedily hither to repeat it unto\nthee."\n\nDamayanti at once went and spoke to her mother privately, for she was assured\nthat Vahuka, the charioteer, was her royal lord. Then she gave of her wealth\nto the Brahman, saying: "Thou wilt get more if Nala returns home." The wise\nParnada was weary with travel, and he departed to his own village.\n\nNeither Damayanti nor her mother made known unto King Bhima their discovery\nnor yet their immediate purpose. Secretly the wife of Nala spake to Sudeva and\nsaid: "Hasten thou unto the city of Ayodhya, and appear before the Rajah\nRituparna as if thou hadst come by chance, and say unto him: \' _Once again is\nthe daughter of Bhima to hold_  \n\np. 360\n\n_her swayamvara. All the kings and all the sons of kings are hastening as\naforetime to Vidarbha. To-morrow at dawn she will choose for herself a new\nlord, for no one knoweth whether Nala liveth or not_.\'"\n\nSo Sudeva went unto Ayodhya and spake as Damayanti desired of him, and then\nsaid: "If thou wouldst win the princess, O Rituparna, thou must go swiftly,\nfor when the sun rises she will choose her a second husband."\n\nRituparna at once sent for Vahuka, and said: "O skilled charioteer, I must\nneeds hasten to Vidarbha in a single day, because that the fair Damayanti\nholdeth her swayamvara at dawn to-morrow."\n\nAt these words the heart of Nala was torn with grief, and he said unto\nhimself: "Is this but a stratagem to deceive me? Or is she whom I wronged\nestranged in mind? Hath she grown fickle of heart, she who hath been soul-\nstricken by grief in the depths of despair?"\n\nThen he spake unto Rituparna and said: "As thou desirest so will I do, O\nRituparna. I will drive thee in a single day to Vidarbha."\n\nHaving promised thus, he went forth and selected four steeds of high courage\nwith the ten good marks, 1 which were as swift as the wind. He yoked them in\nhaste, spake to them soothingly, and then set forth with Rituparna and\nVarshneya also at full speed. The rajah sat in silent wonder as the chariot\nwent swiftly, and to himself he said: "Vahuka hath the god-like skill of the\ncharioteer of heaven. . . . Can he be Nala, who hath taken himself another\nbody? If he is not Nala, he is one who hath equal skill. Great men are\nwandering at times to and fro in disguise--gods who are hidden in human form."\n\np. 361\n\nSo the rajah marvelled and thought, while he rejoiced in the matchless skill\nof the misshapen charioteer.\n\nSwiftly they went. Over hills and rivers and over forests and lakes the\nchariot glided like to a bird through the air. . . . Of a sudden the rajah\'s\nrobe was swept away, and he cried to the charioteer, saying: "Stop at instant,\nso that Varshneya may hasten back and recover my garment."\n\nNala paused not, and said: "Thy robe is now five miles behind us, and we\ncannot wait to recover it."\n\nSo they went on with all speed. Ere long Rituparna beheld a lofty fruit tree,\nnamed Vibhitak, and he said to Vahuka: "Now, skilful charioteer, thou shalt\nperceive my ability in numbers. No single mind is accomplished in every kind\nof knowledge. On two branches of yonder fruit tree are fifty million leaves\nand two thousand and ninety-five berries."\n\nVahuka said: "The leaves and the fruit are invisible to me. But I will tear\noff a branch and count the berries while Varshneya doth hold the bridle."\n\n"But," urged the rajah, "we cannot pause on our journey."\n\nVahuka said: "Thou mayst stay with me, or thou canst let Varshneya drive thee\nat full speed."\n\nThen the rajah spoke soothingly, saying: "O matchless charioteer! I cannot go\non without thee to Vidarbha. I trust in thee. If thou wilt promise that we\nwill reach the city ere night falls, I will do even as you desire."\n\nThe transformed Nala made answer: "I will indeed make haste when I have\ncounted the berries."\n\nSo the horses were drawn up, and Nala tore a branch from the tree. Having\ncounted the berries, he found they were in number even as the rajah had said,\nand he\n\np. 362\n\nexclaimed: "Wonderful, indeed, is thy power, O Rituparna! Fain would I know\nthy secret."\n\nNow the rajah was eager to proceed on his way, and he said: "I know the secret\nof the dice, and am therefore skilled in numbers."\n\n"Then," said Nala, "if thou wilt impart to me thy secret, I will give thee\nknowledge in steeds."\n\nRituparna made answer thereat: "So be it;" and he forthwith informed the\ncharioteer in the science of dice.\n\nNow when Nala grew skilful in dice, Kali immediately passed out of his body,\nand Nishadha\'s fallen king vomited forth the serpent poison and was made weak\nwith the struggle. Released from the venom, Kali resumed his wonted form, but\nhe was beheld by Nala alone, who sought to curse him.\n\nIn his terror, the evil demon folded his hands and said: "Do not injure me, O\nking, and I will give thee matchless fame. . . . Know thou that Damayanti\ncursed me heavily in her wrath when thou didst desert her in the forest, and I\nhave ever since endured great agony. Night and day, too, have I been scorched\nby the poison of the king of serpents. . . . Now I seek thy pity. I come to\nthee that thou mayst be my refuge. Lo! I promise, if thou wilt not curse me,\nthat he who henceforth faileth not to praise thee, will have no dread of me in\nhis heart."\n\nNala\'s wrath subsided, and he permitted Kali to enter the cloven fruit tree.\nThen he leapt into the chariot and drove on, and Kali returned unto his own\nplace.\n\nThe chariot flew on like a bird, and the soul of Nala was elated with\ngladness. But he still retained the form of Vahuka.\n\nAt eventide the watchmen on the walls of Vidarbha\n\np. 363\n\nproclaimed the coming of Rituparna, and King Bhima gave permission that he\nshould enter by the city gate.\n\nAll that region echoed the thunder of the rumbling chariot. Nala\'s horses,\nwhich Varshneya had driven from Nishadha, and were within the city, careered\nand neighed aloud as if Nala were beside them once again.\n\nDamayanti also heard the approaching chariot, and her beating heart was like a\ncloud which thunders as the rain cometh on. Her soul was thrilled by the\nfamiliar sound, and it seemed to her that Nala was drawing nigh. 1 . . . On\nthe palace roofs peacocks craned their necks and danced, 2 and elephants in\ntheir stalls, with uplifted trunks, trumpeted aloud as if rain were about to\nfall.\n\nDamayanti said: "The sound of the chariot fills my soul with ecstasy. Surely\nmy lord cometh. Oh, if I see not soon the moon-fair face of Nala I will surely\ndie, for, thinking of his virtues, my heart is rent with sorrow. Unless he\ncometh now I will no longer live, but will perish by fire."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[353:1](iml27.htm#fr_312) This serpent was a demi-god with human face and\nhands.
