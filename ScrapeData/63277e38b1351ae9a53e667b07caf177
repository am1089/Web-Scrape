On account of such consequences at the time\n\np. 310\n\nof reabsorption (the doctrine maintained hitherto) is objectionable.\n\nThe purvapakshin raises further objections.--If an effect which is\ndistinguished by the qualities of grossness, consisting of parts, absence of\nintelligence, limitation, impurity, &c., is admitted to have Brahman for its\ncause, it follows that at the time of reabsorption (of the world into\nBrahman), the effect, by entering into the state of non-division from its\ncause, inquinates the latter with its properties. As therefore--on your\ndoctrine--the cause (i.e. Brahman) as well as the effect is, at the time of\nreabsorption, characterised by impurity and similar qualities, the doctrine of\nthe Upanishads, according to which an omniscient Brahman is the cause of the\nworld, cannot be upheld.--Another objection to that doctrine is that in\nconsequence of all distinctions passing at the time of reabsorption into the\nstate of non-distinction there would be no special causes left at the time of\na new beginning of the world, and consequently the new world could not arise\nwith all the distinctions of enjoying souls, objects to be enjoyed and so on\n(which are actually observed to exist).--A third objection is that, if we\nassume the origin of a new world even after the annihilation of all works, &c.\n(which are the causes of a new world arising) of the enjoying souls which\nenter into the state of non-difference from the highest Brahman, we are led to\nthe conclusion that also those (souls) which have obtained final release again\nappear in the new world.--If you finally say, 'Well, let this world remain\ndistinct from the highest Brahman even at the time of reabsorption,' we reply\nthat in that case a reabsorption will not take place at all, and that,\nmoreover, the effect's existing separate from the cause is not possible.--For\nall these reasons the Vedanta doctrine is objectionable.\n\nTo this the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1, 9](sbe34148.htm)\n\n"
