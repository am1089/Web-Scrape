The Lord (cannot be the cause of the world), on account of the\ninappropriateness (of that doctrine).\n\nThe Sutrakara now applies himself to the refutation of that doctrine,\naccording to which the Lord is the cause of the world only in so far as he is\nthe general ruler.--But how do you know that that is the purport of the Sutra\n(which speaks of the Lord 'without any qualification')?--From the\ncircumstance, we reply, that the teacher himself has proved, in the previous\nsections of the work, that the Lord is the material cause as well as the ruler\nof the world. Hence, if the present Sutra were meant to impugn the doctrine of\nthe Lord in general, the earlier and later parts of the work would be mutually\ncontradictory, and the Sutrakara would thus be in conflict with himself. We\ntherefore must assume that the purport of the present Sutra is to make an\nenergetic attack on the doctrine of those who maintain that the Lord is not\nthe material cause, but merely the ruler, i.e. the operative cause of the\nworld; a doctrine entirely opposed to the Vedantic tenet of the unity of\nBrahman.\n\nThe theories about the Lord which are independent of the Vedanta are of\nvarious nature. Some taking their stand on the Sa _n_ khya and Yoga systems\nassume that the Lord acts as a mere operative cause, as the ruler of the\n\np. 435\n\npradhana and of the souls, and that pradhana, soul, and Lord are of mutually\ndifferent nature.--The Mahe _s_ varas ( _S_ aivas) maintain that the five\ncategories, viz. effect, cause, union, ritual, the end of pain, were taught by\nthe Lord Pa _s_ upati ( _S_ iva) to the end of breaking the bonds of the\nanimal (i.e. the soul); Pa _s_ upati is, according to them, the Lord, the\noperative cause.--Similarly, the Vai _s_ eshikas and others also teach,\naccording to their various systems, that the Lord is somehow the operative\ncause of the world.\n\nAgainst all these opinions the Sutra remarks 'the Lord, on account of the\ninappropriateness.' I.e. it is not possible that the Lord as the ruler of the\npradhana and the soul should be the cause of the world, on account of the\ninappropriateness of that doctrine. For if the Lord is supposed to assign to\nthe various classes of animate creatures low, intermediate, and high\npositions, according to his liking, it follows that he is animated by hatred,\npassion, and so on, is hence like one of us, and is no real Lord. Nor can we\nget over this difficulty by assuming that he makes his dispositions with a\nview to the merit and demerit of the living beings; for that assumption would\nlead us to a logical see-saw, the Lord as well as the works of living beings\nhaving to be considered in turns both as acting and as acted upon. This\ndifficulty is not removed by the consideration that the works of living beings\nand the resulting dispositions made by the Lord form a chain which has no\nbeginning; for in past time as well as in the present mutual interdependence\nof the two took place, so that the beginningless series is like an endless\nchain of blind men leading other blind men. It is, moreover, a tenet set forth\nby the Naiyayikas themselves that 'imperfections have the characteristic of\nbeing the causes of action' (Nyaya Sutra I, 1, 18). Experience shows that all\nagents, whether they be active for their own purposes or for the purposes of\nsomething else, are impelled to action by some imperfection. And even if it is\nadmitted that an agent even when acting for some extrinsic purpose is impelled\nby an intrinsic motive, your doctrine remains faulty all the same; for the\n\np. 436\n\n[paragraph continues] Lord is no longer a Lord, even if he is actuated by\nintrinsic motives only (such as the desire of removing the painful feeling\nconnected with pity).--Your doctrine is finally inappropriate for that reason\nalso that you maintain the Lord to be a special kind of soul; for from that it\nfollows that he must be devoid of all activity.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 38](sbe34214.htm)\n\n"
