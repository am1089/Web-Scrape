 \nMay Raghu's offspring slay in fight  \nPulastya's sons who roam by night!'  \nIn words like these and more, the best  \nOf high-souled saints their hopes expressed,  \nBending their eager eyes from where  \nCar-borne with Gods they rode in air.  \nBeneath them stretching far, they viewed  \nThe giants' death-doomed multitude.  \nThey saw where, urged with fury, far  \nBefore the host rolled Khara's car,  \nAnd close beside their leader came  \nTwelve giant peers of might and fame. 1  \nFour other chiefs  2 before the rest  \nBehind their leader D'ushan pressed.  \n   Impetuous, cruel, dark, and dread,  \n     All thirsting for the fray,  \n   The hosts of giant warriors sped  \n     Onward upon their way.  \n   With eager speed they reached the spot  \n     Where dwelt the princely two,--  \n   Like planets in a league to blot  \n     The sun and moon from view.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[255:1](ry221.htm#fr_462) The Sarika is the Maina, a bird like a starling.\n\n[256:1](ry221.htm#fr_463) Their names which are rather unmanageable and of no\nimportance are Syenagama, Prithus'y'ama, Yajnas'atru, Vihangama, Durjaya,\nParav'ira'ksha, Purusha, K'alak'amuka, Megham'ali, M'aham'ali*, *Varasya,\nRudhir'as'ana.\n\n[256:2](ry221.htm#fr_464) Mah'akap'ala, Sth'ul'aksha, Pram'atha, Tris'iras.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXIV.: The Host In Sight.](ry222.htm)\n\n"
