Naraya _n_ a said :-- Yama got thunderstruck at these queries of Savitri.\nHe then began to describe, with a smiling countenance, the fruition of the\nseveral works of the Jivas.\n\n\n\n2-8. He said :-- \xc2\x93O Child! You are now a daughter only twelve years old. But\nyou speak of wisdom like the Highest J\xc3\xb1anins and Yogis, Sanaka and others. O\nChild! By virtue of the boon granted by Savitri, you have become incarnate of\nHer in part. The King As\xc2\x92vapati got you before by performing severe penances.\nAs Lak _s_ mi is dear and fortunate with regard to Vi _sn_ u, as Mahadevi is\nto Mahadeva, Aditi to Kas\xc2\x92yapa, Ahalya to Gautama, so you are to Satyavana in\nrespect of affection and good-luck and other best qualities. As S\xc2\x92achi is to\nMahendra, as Rohi _n_ i is to Moon, as Rati is to Kama, as Svaha is to Fire,\nas Svadha is to the Pitris, as Sanj\xc3\xb1a is to the Sun, as Varu _n_ ani is to\nVaru _n_ a, as Dak _s_ i _n_ a is to Yaj\xc3\xb1a, as Earth is to Varaha, as Devasena\nis to Kartika, so you are fortunate and blessed with respect to Satyavana. O\nSavitri! I myself grant you this boon of my own accord. Now ask other boons. O\nhighly fortunate One! I will fulfil all your desires.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n9-12. Savitri said :-- \xc2\x93O Noble One! Let there be one hundred sons of mine by\nSatyavana. This is the boon that I want. Let there be one hundred sons of my\nFather as well; let my Father-in-law get back his (lost) eyesight and may he\nget back his lost kingdom. This is another boon that I want. Thou art the Lord\nof the world. So grant me this boon, too, that I may have this my very body\nfor a lakh years when I may go to Vaiku _nt_ ha with Satyavana. Now I am eager\nto hear the various fruitions of Karmas of several Jivas. Kindly narrate them\nand oblige.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n13-70. Dharma said :-- You are very chaste. So what you have thought will\nverily come to pass. Now I describe the fruition of Karmas of the Jivas.\nListen. Excepting this holy land of Bharata, nowhere do the people enjoy\nwholly the fruition of their two-fold Karmas, good and bad. It is only the\nSuras, Daityas, Danavas, Gandharvas, Rak _s_ asas, and men that do Karmas. The\nbeasts and the other Jivas do not do Karmas. The special Jivas, e.g., men,\netc., experience the fruition of their Karmas in Heavens, hells and in all the\nother Yonis (wombs). Specially, as the Jivas\n\n\n\np. 915\n\n\n\nroam in all the different Yonis, they enjoy their Karmas, good or bad, as the\ncase may be, carved in their previous births. The good works get fructified in\nHeavens; and the bad works lead the Jivas to hells. This Karma can be got rid\nof by Bhakti. This Bhakti is of two kinds :-- (1) Nirgu _n_ a of the nature of\nNirva _n_ a; and (2) towards Prakriti, of the astute of Brahma, and with Maya\ninherent. Diseases come as the result of bad and ignorant actions and\nhealthiness comes from good and certain scientific Karmas. Similar are the\nremarks for short and long lives for happiness and pain. By bad works, one\nbecomes blind or deformed in body. So by doing excellent Karmas, one acquires\nSiddhis, etc.. These are spoken generally. I will now speak in detail; listen.\nThis is very secret even in Pura _n_ as and Smritis. In this Bharatavar _s_ a\nmen are the best of all the various classes of beings. The Brahma _n_ s are\nthe best of men and are best in all Kinds of Karmas. They are responsible,\ntoo, for their actions. O Chaste One! Of the Brahmi _n_ s, again, those that\nare attached to the Brahma _n_ as are the best. The Brahma _n_ as are of two\nkinds as they are Sakama (with desires) or Ni _s_ kama (without desires). The\nNi _s_ kami Brahma _n_ as are superior to the Sakami Brahma _n_ as. For the\nSakamis are to enjoy the fruits of their Karmas, while the Ni _s_ kami Brahma\n_n_ as are perfectly free from any such disturbances (they have not to come\nback to this field of Karma). The Ni _s_ kama Bhakta after they quit their\nbodies, go to a place free from sickness or disease, pure and perfect. From\nthere they do not come back. The Ni _s_ kama Bhaktas assuming the divine forms\ngo to the Goloka and worship the Highest God, the Highest Self, the two-armed\nKri _sn_ a. The Sakami Vai _sn_ avas go to Vaiku _nt_ ha; but they come back\nin Bharata and get into the wombs of the twice-born. By degrees they also\nbecome Ni _s_ kama when they certainly acquire pure undefiled Bhakti. The\nBrahma _n_ as and Vai _sn_ avas that are Sakamis in all the births, never get\nthat pure undefiled intellect and never get the devotion to Vi _sn_ u. The\nBrahma _n_ as, living in the Tirthas (sacred places of pilgrimages) and\nattached to Tapas go to Brahmaloka (the region of Brahma); they again come\ndown to Bharata. Those that are devotedly attached to their own Dharma\n(religion) and reside in places other than Tirthas, go to Satyaloka and again\ncome to Bharata. The Brahma _n_ as, following their own Dharma and devoted to\nthe Sun go to the world of the Sun and again come to Bharata. And those who\nare devoted to Mula Prakriti and devoted to Ni _s_ kama Dharma go to Ma _n_ i\nDvipa and have not to come back from thither. The Bhaktas of S\xc2\x92iva, S\xc2\x92akti,\nand Gane\xc2\x92sa, and attached to their own Dharmas respectively go to the S\xc2\x92iva\nLoka and return from thence. Those Brahma _n_ as that worship the other Devas\nand attached to their\n\n\n\np. 916\n\n\n\nown Dharmas go to those regions of theirs respectively and again come to\nBharata. Attached to their own Dharmas, the Ni _s_ kami Bhaktas of Hari go by\ntheir Bhakti step by step to the region of S\xc2\x92ri Hari. Those that are not\nattached to their own Dharmas and do not worship the Devas and always bent on\ndoing things as they like without any regard to their \xc3\x82charas go certainly to\nhells. No doubt in this. The Brahma _n_ as and the other three Var _n_ as,\nattached to their own Dharmas all enjoy the fruits of their good works. But\nthose who do not do their Svadharma, go verily down into hells. They do not\ncame to Bharata for their rebirth, they enjoy their fruits of Karmas in hells!\nTherefore the four Var _n_ as ought to follow their own Dharmas of the Brahma\n_n_ as, they are to remain attached to their own Dharmas and give their\ndaughters in marriage to the similarly qualified Brahma _n_ as. They then go\nto the Chandraloka (the region of the Moon). There they remain for the life\nperiods of the fourteen Indras. And if the girl be given, with ornaments, the\nresults obtained would be twice. If the girl be given with a desire in view,\nthen that world is obtained; but if the girl be given without any desire but\nto fulfil the God\xc2\x92s will and God\xc2\x92s satisfaction only, then one would not have\nto go to that world. They go to Vi _sn_ u Loka, bereft of the fruits of all\nKarmas. Those that give to the Brahma _n_ as pasture ground and cattle,\nsilver, gold, garment, fruits and water, go to the Chandraloka and live there\nfor one Manvantara. They live long in those regions by virtue of that merit.\nAgain those that give gold, cows, copper, etc., to the holy Brahma _n_ as, go\nto the Surya Loka (the region of the Sun) and live there for one Ayuta years\n(10,000 years), free from diseases, etc., for a long time. Those that give\nlands and lots of wealth to the Brahmi _n_ s, go to the Vi _sn_ u Loka and to\nthe beautiful S\xc2\x92veta Dvipa (one of the eighteen minor divisions of the known\ncontinents). And there they live as long as the Sun and Moon exist. O Muni!\nThe meritorious persons live long in that wide region. Note :-- S\xc2\x92veta Dvipa\nmay mean Vaiku _nt_ ha, where Vi _sn_ u resides. Those who give with devotion\ndwelling places to the Brahma _n_ as, go to the happy Vi _sn_ u Loka. And\nthere, in that great Vi _sn_ u Loka, they live for years equal to the number\nof molecules, in that house. He who offers a dwelling house in honour of any\nDeva, goes to the region of that Deva and remains there for a number of years\nequivalent to the number of particles in that house. The lotus-born Brahma\nsaid that if one offers a royal palace, one obtains a result four times and if\none offers a country, one gets the result one hundred times that; again if one\noffers an excellent country, twice as much merit one acquires. One who\ndedicates a tank for the expiation of\n\n\n\np. 917\n\n\n\nall one\xc2\x92s sins, one lives in Janar Loka (one of the pious regions) for a\nperiod equivalent to the number of particles therein). If any man offers a\nVapi (a well) in preference to other gifts, one gets ten fold fruits thereby.\nIf one offers seven Vapis, one acquires the fruits of offering one tank. A\nVapi is one which is four thousand Dhanus long and which is as much wide or\nless (Note :-- Dhanu equals a measure of four hastas). If offered to a good\nbridegroom, then the giving of a daughter in marriage is equivalent to a\ndedication of ten Vapis. And if the girl be offered with ornaments, twice the\nmerits accrue. The same merit accrues in clearing the bed of the mud of a pond\nas in digging it. So for the Vapi (well). O Chaste One! He who plants an\nAs\xc2\x92vattha tree and dedicates it to a godly purpose, lives for one Ayuta years\nin Tapar Loka. O Savitri! He who dedicates a flower garden for the acquirement\nof all sorts of good, lives for one Ayuta years in Dhruva Loka.\n\n\n\nO Chaste One! He who gives a Vimana (any sort of excellent carriage) in honour\nof Vi _sn_ u, in this Hindoosthan, lives for one Manvantara in Vis _nu_ loka.\nAnd if one gives a Vimana of variegated colours and workmanship, four times\nthe result accrues. And one who gives a palanquin, acquires half the fruits.\nAgain if anybody gives, out of devotion, a swinging temple (the Dol Mandir) to\nBhagavan S\xc2\x92ri Hari, lives for one hundred Manvantras, in the region of Vi _sn_\nu. O Chaste One! He who makes a gift of a royal road, decorated with palatial\nbuildings on either side, lives with great honour and love in that Indraloka\nfor one Ayuta years. Equal results follow whether the above things are offered\nto the Gods or to the Brahma _n_ as. He enjoys that which he gives. No giving,\nno enjoying. After enjoying the heavenly pleasures, etc., the virtuous person\ntakes birth in Bharata as a Brahmi _n_ or in other good families, in due\norder, and ultimately in the Brahma _n_ a families. The virtuous Brahma _n_ a,\nafter he has enjoyed the heavenly pleasures, takes his birth again in Bharata\nin Brahma _n_ a, K _s_ attriya or in Vais\xc2\x92ya families. A K _s_ attriya or a\nVais\xc2\x92ya can never obtain Brahma _n_ ahood, even if he performs asceticism for\none Ko _t_ i Kalpas. This is stated in the S\xc2\x92rutis. Without enjoying the\nfruits, no Karma can be exhausted even in one hundred Ko _t_ i Kalpas. So the\nfruits of the Karmas must be enjoyed, whether they be auspicious or\ninauspicious. By the help of seeing the Devas and seeing the Tirthas again and\nagain, purity is acquired. O Savitri! So now I have told you something. What\nmore d o you want to hear? Say.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-Ninth Chapter of the Ninth Book on the anecdote of\nSavitri on the fruits of making gifts and on the effects of Karmas in S\xc2\x92ri Mad\nDevi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 30](bk09ch30.htm)\n\n'
