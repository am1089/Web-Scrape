For (the clause \'Not so, not so\') denies (of Brahman) the suchness which\nforms the topic of\n\np. 167\n\ndiscussion; and (the text) enounces something more than that.\n\nWe read, B _ri_. Up. II, 3, \'Two forms of Brahman there are indeed, the\nmaterial and the immaterial, the mortal and the immortal, the solid and the\nfluid, sat and tya.\' The text thereupon divides the five elements into two\nclasses, predicates of the essence of that which is immaterial--which it calls\npurusha--saffron-colour, and so on, and then goes on to say, \'Now then the\nteaching by Not so, not so! For there is nothing else higher than this (if one\nsays): It is not so.\' Here we have to enquire what the object of the negative\nstatement is. We do not observe any definite thing indicated by words such as\n\'this\' or \'that;\' we merely have the word \'so\' in \'Not so, not so!\' to which\nthe word \'not\' refers, and which on that account indicates something meant to\nbe denied. Now we know that the word \'so\' (iti) is used with reference to\napproximate things, in the same way as the particle \'evam\' is used; compare,\ne.g. the sentence \'so (iti) indeed the teacher said\' (where the \'so\' refers to\nhis immediately preceding speech). And, in our passage, the context points out\nwhat has to be considered as proximate, viz. the two cosmic forms of Brahman,\nand that Brahman itself to which the two forms belong. Hence there arises a\ndoubt whether the phrase, \'Not so, not so!\' negatives both Brahman and its two\nforms, or only either; and if the latter, whether it negatives Brahman and\nleaves its two forms, or if it negatives the two forms and leaves Brahman.--We\nsuppose, the purvapakshin says, that the negative statement negatives Brahman\nas well as its two forms; both being suggested by the context. As the word\n\'not\' is repeated twice, there are really two negative statements, of which\nthe one negatives the cosmic form of Brahman, the other that which has form,\ni.e. Brahman itself. Or else we may suppose that Brahman alone is negatived.\nFor as Brahman transcends all speech and thought, its existence is doubtful,\nand admits of being negatived; the plurality of cosmic forms on the other hand\nfalls within the sphere of perception and the other means of right\n\np. 168\n\nknowledge, and can, therefore, not be negatived.--On this latter\ninterpretation the repetition of \'not\' must be considered as due to emphasis\nonly.\n\nTo this we make the following reply. It is impossible that the phrase, \'Not\nso, not so!\' should negative both, since that would imply the doctrine of a\ngeneral Void. Whenever we deny something unreal, we do so with reference to\nsomething real; the unreal snake, e.g. is negatived with reference to the real\nrope. But this (denial of something unreal with reference to something real)\nis possible only if some entity is left. If everything is denied, no entity is\nleft, and if no entity is left, the denial of some other entity which we may\nwish to undertake, becomes impossible, i.e. that latter entity becomes real\nand as such cannot be negatived.--Nor, in the second place, can Brahman be\ndenied; for that would contradict the introductory phrase of the chapter,\n\'Shall I tell you Brahman?\' (B _ri_. Up. II, 1, 1); would show disregard of\nthe threat conveyed in Taitt. Up. II, 6, \'He who knows the Brahman as non-\nexisting becomes himself non-existing;\' would be opposed to definitive\nassertions such as \'By the words "He is" is he to be apprehended\' (Ka. Up. II,\n6, 13); and would involve a stultification of the entire Vedanta.--The phrase\nthat Brahman transcends all speech and thought does certainly not mean to say\nthat Brahman does not exist; for after the Vedanta-part of scripture has\nestablished at length the existence of Brahman--in such passages as \'He who\nknows Brahman obtains the highest;\' \'Truth, knowledge, infinite is Brahman\'--\nit cannot be supposed all at once to teach its non-existence. For, as the\ncommon saying is, \'Better than bathing it is not to touch dirt at all.\' The\npassage, \'from whence all speech with the mind turns away unable to reach it\'\n(Taitt. Up. II, 4), must, therefore, rather be viewed as intimating Brahman.\n\nThe passage of the B _ri_. Up. under discussion has, therefore, to be\nunderstood as follows. Brahman is that whose nature is permanent purity,\nintelligence, and freedom; it transcends speech and mind, does not fall within\nthe category of \'object,\' and constitutes the inward Self of all. Of this\nBrahman our text denies all plurality of forms; but\n\np. 169\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahman itself it leaves untouched. This the Sutra\nexpresses in the words, \'for it denies the suchness which forms the topic of\ndiscussion.\' That means: The passage \'Not so,\' &c., denies of Brahman the\nlimited form, material as well as immaterial, which in the preceding part of\nthe chapter is described at length with reference to the gods as well as the\nbody, and also the second form which is produced by the first, is\ncharacterised by mental impressions, forms the essence of that which is\nimmaterial, is denoted by the term purusha, rests on the subtle Self\n(li\xe1\xb9\x85gatman) and is described by means of comparisons with saffron-colour, &c.,\nsince the purusha, which is the essence of what is immaterial, does not itself\npossess colour perceivable by the eye. Now these forms of Brahman are by means\nof the word \'so\' (iti), which always refers to something approximate brought\ninto connexion with the negative particle \'not.\' Brahman itself, on the other\nhand (apart from its forms), is, in the previous part of the chapter,\nmentioned not as in itself constituting the chief topic, but only in so far as\nit is qualified by its forms; this appears from the circumstance of Brahman\nbeing exhibited in the genitive case only (\'These are two forms _of Brahman_\n\'). Now, after the two forms have been set forth, there arises the desire of\nknowing that to which the two forms belong, and hence the text continues, \'Now\nthen the teaching by means of "Not so, not so."\' This passage, we conclude,\nconveys information regarding the nature of Brahman by denying the reality of\nthe forms fictitiously attributed to it; for the phrase, \'Not so, not so!\'\nnegatives the whole aggregate of effects superimposed on Brahman. Effects we\nknow to have no real existence, and they can therefore be negatived; not so,\nhowever, Brahman, which constitutes the necessary basis for all fictitious\nsuperimposition.--Nor must the question be asked here, how the sacred text,\nafter having itself set forth the two forms of Brahman, can negative them in\nthe end, contrary to the principle that not to touch dirt is better than\nbathing after having done so. For the text does not set forth the two forms of\nBrahman as something the truth of which is to be established, but merely\nmentions those two forms, which in\n\np. 170\n\nthe sphere of ordinary thought are fictitiously attributed to Brahman, in\norder finally to negative them and establish thereby the true nature of the\nformless Brahman.\n\nThe double repetition of the negation may either serve the purpose of\nfurnishing a special denial of the material as well as the immaterial form of\nBrahman; or the first \'Not so\' may negative the aggregate of material\nelements, while the second denies the aggregate of mental impressions. Or else\nthe repetition may be an emphatic one, intimating that whatever can be thought\nis not Brahman. This is, perhaps, the better explanation. For if a limited\nnumber of things are denied each individually, there still remains the desire\nto know whether something else may not be Brahman; an emphatic repetition of\nthe denial on the other hand shows that the entire aggregate of objects is\ndenied and that Brahman is the inward Self; whereby all further enquiry is\nchecked.--The final conclusion, therefore, is, that the text negatives only\nthe cosmic plurality fictitiously superimposed on Brahman, but leaves Brahman\nitself untouched.\n\nThe Sutra gives another argument establishing the same conclusion, \'and the\ntext enounces something more than that,\' i.e. more than the preceding\nnegation. The words of the text meant are \'(not) is there anything beyond.\'--\nIf the negation, \'Not so, not so!\' were meant to negative all things whatever,\nand this terminated in absolute non-existence, the text could not even allude\nto \'anything beyond.\'--The words of the text are to be connected as follows.\nAfter the clause, \'Not so, not so!\' has given information about Brahman, the\nclause next following illustrates this teaching by saying: There is nothing\nbeyond or separate from this Brahman; therefore Brahman is expressed by \'Not\nso, not so!\' which latter words do not mean that Brahman itself does not\nexist. The implied meaning rather is that different from everything else there\nexists the \'non-negatived\' Brahman.--The words of the text admit, however, of\nanother interpretation also; for they may mean that there is no teaching of\nBrahman higher than that teaching which is implied in the negation of\nplurality expressed by \'Not so, not so!\' On this latter interpretation\n\np. 171\n\nthe words of the Sutra, \'and the text enounces something more than that,\' must\nbe taken to refer to the name mentioned in the text, \'Then comes the name, the\nTrue of the True; the senses being the True and he the True of them.\'--This\nagain has a sense only if the previous negative clause denies everything but\nBrahman, not everything but absolute non-existence. For, if the latter were\nthe case, what then could be called the True of the True?--We therefore decide\nthat the clause, \'Not so, not so!\' negatives not absolutely everything, but\nonly everything but Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2, 23](sbe38126.htm)\n\n'
