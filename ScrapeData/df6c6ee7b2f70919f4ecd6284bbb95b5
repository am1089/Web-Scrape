'A drop of water which is allowed to fall (on the ground) purifies a\nbull's hide of land, whether (the land) has been (previously) swept or not,\nprovided no impure substance is visible on it.' 1\n\n2\\. Food which is cooked out of sight must be illuminated (with fire) and be\nsprinkled with water, 2\n\n3\\. Likewise eatables bought in the market. 3\n\n4\\. For the Veda (declares), 'For the gods who are (easily) disgusted and\ndesirous of purity do not\n\np. 173\n\nenjoy the offerings made by a man destitute of faith.'\n\n5\\. After reflecting (for a, long time on the respective value of) the (food)\nof a pure man destitute of faith and of an impure person who has faith, the\ngods declared both to be equal. But the Lord of created beings said to them,\n'That is not equal, it is unequal. The food of a man destitute of faith is\nworthless, that which is purified by faith is preferable.'\n\n6\\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'Want of faith is the greatest\nsin; for faith is the highest austerity. Therefore the gods do not eat\nofferings given without faith.'\n\n7\\. 'A foolish man does not reach heaven, though he may offer (sacrifices) or\ngive (gifts).'\n\n8\\. 'He is called a foolish man whose conduct is blemished by doubts, and who,\nclinging to his own fancies, transgresses (the rules of) the _S_ astras,\nbecause he opposes the fulfilment of the sacred law.' 8\n\n9\\. But pot-herbs, flowers, fruit, roots, and annual plants (must be)\nsprinkled (with water). 9\n\n10\\. Having placed dry grass, wood of trees unfit for sacrifices or a clod of\nearth (on the ground), let him void faeces or urine, turning his face during\nthe day towards the north and at night towards the south and wrapping up his\nhead. 10\n\np. 174\n\n11\\. (After voiding) urine he shall clean (the organ once) with earth and\nwater, 11\n\n12\\. The hand three times.\n\n13\\. In like manner (he shall clean himself with earth and water after\nvoiding) faeces. 13\n\n14\\. The number (of the applications of both is) thrice three for both feet\nand the hand.\n\n15\\. After an effusion of semen (he shall purify himself) in the same manner\nas after voiding urine. 15\n\n16\\. He shall wash himself, after he has untied or put on the cloth round his\nloins, 16\n\n17\\. Or he may touch moist grass, cowdung, or earth. 17\n\n18\\. While he is engaged in (the performance of) religious rites, he shall\navoid to touch (the part of his body) below the navel. 18\n\n19\\. The Veda (declares), 'A man's (body) is pure above the navel, it is\nimpure below the navel.' 19\n\n20\\. _S_ udras living in the service of \xc3\x82ryans shall trim (their hair and\nnails) every month; their mode 20\n\np. 175\n\nof sipping water (shall be) the same as that of \xc3\x82ryans.\n\n21\\. A Vai _s_ ya may live by usury. 21\n\n22\\. But (a sum of) twenty-five (karshapa _n_ as shall bear an interest) of\nfive mashas (per mensem). 22\n\n23\\. Now they quote also (the following verses) 'He who, acquiring property\ncheap, employs (it so that it yields) a higher price, is called a usurer, and\nblamed in all (treatises on) the sacred law.' '(Brahman) weighed in the scales\nthe crime of killing a learned Brahma _n_ a against (the crime of) usury; the\nslayer of the Brahma _n_ a remained at the top, the usurer sank downwards.' 23\n\n24\\. 'Let him treat Brahma _n_ as who tend cattle, those who live by trade,\n(and) those who are artisans, actors (and bards), servants or usurers, like\n_S_ udras.' 24\n\n25\\. But men of the first two castes may, at their pleasure, lend (money at\ninterest) to one who neglects his sacred duties, to a miser, to an atheist, or\nto a very wicked man. 25\n\n26\\. Through the neglect of sacrifices, of (lawful) marriages, of the study of\nthe Veda, and of (learned) Brahma _n_ as, (noble) families (even) are\ndegraded. 26\n\n27\\. The offence of neglecting a Brahma _n_ a cannot be committed against a\nfool who is unacquainted 27\n\np. 176\n\nwith the Veda. For (in offering sacrifices) one does not pass by a brilliant\nfire and throw the oblations into ashes.\n\n28\\. Families which are deficient in (the knowledge of) the Veda, are degraded\nby (keeping) cows, horses and vehicles, by agriculture and by serving the\nking. 28\n\n29\\. But even poor families which are rich in (the knowledge of) the Veda\nobtain rank among the (noble) families and gain great fame.\n\n30\\. The (study of) the Veda impedes (the pursuit of) agriculture, (the\npursuit of) agriculture impedes (the study of) the Veda. He who is able (to do\nit), may attend to both; but he who is unable (to attend to both), shall give\nup agriculture.\n\n31\\. A fat, bellowing, raging humped bull, who does not restrain himself, who\nhurts living creatures and speaks according to his pleasure, forsooth, does\nnot reach the (abode of) the gods; (but) those who are small like atoms,\n(being) emaciated (by austerities and fasts), go thither.\n\n32\\. If, erring, in his youth he commits at any time good or evil acts of any\nkind, (they will all remain without result). (For) if in his later age he\nlives righteously, he will obtain (the reward of) that (virtuous conduct)\nalone, not (the punishments of his former) crimes.\n\n33\\. Let him always be sorrowing in his heart, when he thinks of his sins,\n(let him) practise austerities and be careful; thus he will be freed from sin.\n\n34\\. 'Where drops of water touch the feet of a 34\n\np. 177\n\nman who offers water for sipping to others, no defilement is caused by them.\nThey are equally (pure) as (water) collected on the ground.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[172:1](sbe1443.htm#fr_865) **10**. Regarding the term 'a bull's hide' of\nland, see Vish _n_ u V, 181-183, XCII, 4.\n\n[172:2](sbe1443.htm#fr_866) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 2, 3, 9. 'Out of sight,' i.e. not\nbefore the eyes of him who eats it.'--Govinda. It would, however, seem that\nthis rule refers to food prepared by _S_ udras, without the super-visions of\n\xc3\x82ryans. For \xc3\x82pastamba's Sutra, which contains the same word, paroksham, 'out\nof sight,' certainly has reference to that case only, and there is no reason\nwhy food prepared by Brahman cooks should be purified before it is eaten.\n\n[172:3](sbe1443.htm#fr_867) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 17, 19. The eatables here intended\nare, according to Govinda, La _d_ us and other sweet-meats which are\nfrequently bought ready made.\n\n[173:8](sbe1443.htm#fr_868) Dharmatantra, translated 'the fulfilment of the\nsacred law,' is explained in the commentary by dharmasya tantram anush _th_\nanam, by 'the performance of the sacred duties.' It may also mean 'the\ndoctrine of or the treatises on the sacred law.' The _S_ astras are the Vedas\nand the whole body of the sacred literature.\n\n[173:9](sbe1443.htm#fr_869) Vish _n_ u XXIII, 15.\n\n[173:10](sbe1443.htm#fr_870) Vasish _th_ a, VI, 10.\n\n[174:11](sbe1443.htm#fr_871)-12. Vasish _th_ a VI, 14, 18. According to\nGovinda one application of water suffices for the left hand and two for both\ntogether.\n\n[174:13](sbe1443.htm#fr_872)-14. Vasish _th_ a VI, 18. Govinda reads in Sutra\n14, against the authority of all the MSS., payo _h_ , 'for the anus,' instead\nof padayo _h_ , 'for both feet.'\n\n[174:15](sbe1443.htm#fr_873) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 15, 23.\n\n[174:16](sbe1443.htm#fr_874) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 16, 14.\n\n[174:17](sbe1443.htm#fr_875) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 16, 15.\n\n[174:18](sbe1443.htm#fr_876) Vish _n_ u XXIII, 51.\n\n[174:19](sbe1443.htm#fr_877) Taittiriya Sa _m_ hita VI, 1, 3, 4.\n\n[174:20](sbe1443.htm#fr_878) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 1, 2, 4-5. The above translation\nfollows Govinda's explanation. But aryadhish _th_ ita _h_ , 'living in the\nservice of \xc3\x82ryans,' may also mean 'superintended by \xc3\x82ryans,' and the rule be\ntaken to refer to the special case of _S_ udra cooks, as in the parallel\npassage of \xc3\x82pastamba.\n\n[175:21](sbe1443.htm#fr_879) Vasish _th_ a II, 19.\n\n[175:22](sbe1443.htm#fr_880) Vasish _th_ a II, 51.\n\n[175:23](sbe1443.htm#fr_881) Vasish _th_ a II, 41-42.\n\n[175:24](sbe1443.htm#fr_882) Vasish _th_ a III, 3.\n\n[175:25](sbe1443.htm#fr_883) Vasish _th_ a II, 43. M. reads na dadyatam, shall\nnot lend.' According to Govinda, 'a very wicked man' is equivalent to 'a _S_\nudra.'\n\n[175:26](sbe1443.htm#fr_884) Manu III, 63. Govinda says that this Sutra is\nintroduced in connexion with the expression, 'one who neglects his sacred\nduties,' which occurs in Sutra 25.\n\n[175:27](sbe1443.htm#fr_885) Vasish _th_ a III, 9 note, 10. This Sutra is\nadded in explanation of the term 'the offence of neglecting a Brahma _n_ a.'\n\n[176:28](sbe1443.htm#fr_886)-29. Manu III, 64, 66.\n\n[176:34](sbe1443.htm#fr_887) Vasish _th_ a III, 42.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Adhyaya 5, Ka _n_ _d_ ika 11](sbe1444.htm)\n\n"
