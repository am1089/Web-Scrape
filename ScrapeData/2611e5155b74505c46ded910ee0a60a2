On the full moon day of the _S_ rava _n_ a month the _S_ rava _n_ a\nceremony (is performed).\n\n2\\. Having filled a new jug with flour of fried barley, he lays (this jug) and\na spoon for offering the Balis on new strings of a carrying pole (and thus\nsuspends them).\n\n3\\. Having prepared fried barley grains, he smears half of them with butter.\n\n4\\. After sunset he prepares a mess of cooked food and a cake in one dish and\nsacrifices (the cooked food) with the four verses, 'Agni, lead us on a good\npath to wealth' (Rig-veda I, 189, 1 seqq.), verse by verse, and with his hand\nthe (cake) in one dish with (the formula), 'To the steady One, the earth-\ndemon, svaha!'\n\n5\\. (The cake) should be (entirely) immersed (into the butter), or its back\nshould be visible.\n\n6\\. With (the verse), 'Agni, do not deliver us to evil' (Rig-veda I, 189, 5)\nhe sacrifices over it (the butter) in which it had lain.\n\n7 7-8. With (the verse), 'May the steeds at our invocation be for a blessing\nto us' (Rig-veda VII, 38, 7) (he sacrifices) the besmeared grains with his\njoined hands,\n\n8\\. The other (grains) he should give to his people.\n\n9\\. Out of the jug he fills the spoon with flour,\n\np. 202\n\ngoes out (of the house) to the east, pours water on the ground on a clean\nspot, sacrifices with (the formula), 'To the divine hosts of the serpents\nsvaha!' and does reverence to them with (the formula), 'The serpents which are\nterrestrial, which are aerial, which are celestial, which dwell in the\ndirections (of the horizon)\xc2\x97to them I have brought this Bali; to them I give\nover this Bali.'\n\n10\\. Having gone round (the Bali) from left to right, he sits down to the west\nof the Bali with (the words), 'The serpent art thou; the lord of the creeping\nserpents art thou; by food thou protectest men, by cake the serpents, by\nsacrifice the gods. To me, being in thee, the serpents being in thee should do\nno harm. I give over the firm one (i.e. the spoon) to thee.'\n\n11\\. 'Firm one, (I give) N.N. (in charge) to thee! Firm one, (I give) N.N. (in\ncharge) to thee!'\xc2\x97with (these words he gives) his people, man by man, (in\ncharge to the serpent god);\n\n12\\. 'Firm one, I give myself in charge to thee!'\xc2\x97with these words himself at\nthe end.\n\n13\\. Let no one step between it (i.e. the Bali, and the sacrificer), until the\ngiving in charge has been performed.\n\n14 14. With (the formula), 'To the divine hosts of the serpents svaha!'\xc2\x97let\nhim offer the Bali in the evening and in the morning, till the Pratyavaroha\n_n_ a (i.e. the ceremony of the 'redescent').\n\n15 15. Some count (the days till the Pratyavaroha _n_ a)\n\np. 203\n\nand offer the corresponding number of Balis already on that day (on which the\n_S_ rava _n_ a ceremony is performed).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[201:1](sbe29124.htm#fr_485) 1, 1. Naraya _n_ a's observation that the _S_\nrava _n_ a full moon can fall also under certain other Nakshatras than _S_\nrava _n_ a itself, furnishes no reason why we should think here of solar\nmonths, as Prof. Stenzler proposes.\n\n[201:7-8](sbe29124.htm#fr_486) 7, 8.
