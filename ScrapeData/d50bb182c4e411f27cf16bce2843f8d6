With the Highest; for thus it says.\n\nIt has been shown that at the time of departure from the body the soul\ntogether with the organs and pra _n_ as unites itself with the subtle\nelements, fire and the rest; and the notion that the soul of him who knows\nforms an exception has been disposed of. The further question now arises\nwhether those subtle elements move on towards producing their appropriate\neffects, in accordance with the works or the nature of meditation (of some\nother soul with which those elements join themselves), or unite themselves\nwith the highest Self.--The Purvapakshin holds that, as in the case of union\nwith the highest Self, they could not give rise to their peculiar effects,\ni.e. the experience of pleasure and pain, they move towards some place where\nthey can give rise to their appropriate effects.--Of this view the Sutra\ndisposes. They unite themselves with the highest Self; for Scripture declares\n'warmth in the highest Being' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 8, 6). And the doings of those\nelements must be viewed in such a way as to agree with Scripture. As in the\nstates of deep sleep and a pralaya, there is, owing to union with the highest\nSelf, a cessation of all experience of pain and pleasure; so it is in the case\nunder question also.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'union with the\nHighest.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 15.
