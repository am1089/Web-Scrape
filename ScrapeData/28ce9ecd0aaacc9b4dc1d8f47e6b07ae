Draw Rudra hither for your protection [1](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:1:1), the\nking of sacrifice, the truly sacrificing Hot _ri_ of the two worlds\n[2](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:1:2), the golden-coloured Agni, before the unseen\nthunderbolt (strikes you).\n\n2\\. This is the home which we have prepared for thee as a well-dressed, loving\nwife (prepares the marriage-bed) for her husband [1](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:2:1).\nDirected hitherward, dressed (in offerings and prayers?)\n[2](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:2:2) sit down. These (sacrificial ladles or prayers?)\nare turned towards thee, O most skilful one [3](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:2:3)!\n\n3\\. To him who hears us, who is not proud, who beholds men, to the merciful,\nimmortal god recite a prayer, O worshipper, a hymn--(to Agni) whom the presser\n(of Soma), the Madhu-presser, magnifies like the pressing-stone\n[1](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:3:1).\n\n4\\. Thou who art well-intentioned, give heed to this our toiling\n[1](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:4:1), to this _Ri_ ta [2](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:4:2), O\nobserver of _Ri_ ta! When will our hymns share in thy rejoicings? When will\nour friendship dwell in thy house?\n\n5\\. How wilt thou, O Agni, before Varu _n_ a, and how wilt thou, and which sin\nof ours wilt thou blame before Dyaus? How wilt thou speak to bountiful Mitra,\nto the Earth? What (wilt thou say) to Aryaman, to Bhaga?\n\n6\\. What wilt thou say, O Agni, when thou hast grown strong on the Dhish _n_\nya altars [1](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:6:1)? What to strong Vata who goes forward\nin triumph [2](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:6:2)? To the Nasatya\n[3](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:6:3) who goes round the earth\n[4](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:6:4), to \xe2\x80\xa6 [5](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:6:5)? What, O Agni,\nto Rudra, the man-killer?\n\np. 326\n\n7\\. How (wilt thou speak) to great Pushan who brings prosperity? What (wilt\nthou say) to martial Rudra, the giver of offerings\n[1](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:7:1)? What sin [2](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:7:2) wilt thou\nannounce to wide-ruling Vish _n_ u, what, O Agni, to the mighty weapon (of the\ngods)?\n\n8\\. How wilt thou answer, when thou art asked, to the righteous\n[1](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:8:1) host of the Maruts? How to the mighty Sun, to the\nquick Aditi [2](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:8:2)? Accomplish thy work, O _G_ atavedas,\nthou who knowest the Heaven!\n\n9\\. I magnify [1](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:9:1) the _Ri_ ta of the cow\n[2](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:9:2) ruled by _Ri_ ta and also by the raw one\n[3](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:9:3), the honey-sweet, ripe (milk), O Agni. Though\nbeing black this (cow) swells of bright drink, of \xe2\x80\xa6\n[4](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:9:4) milk.\n\n10\\. With _Ri_ ta indeed, with the milk of the back\n[1](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:10:1), the bull has been anointed, Agni the man.\nWithout trembling he moved on bestowing his vigour. The speckled bull has\npoured out his bright udder [2](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:10:2).\n\n11 [1](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:11:1). By the _Ri_ ta the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras have broken the\nrock and cleft it asunder; they have shouted together with the cows.\nProsperously the men have surrounded [2](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:11:2) the Dawn.\nThe Sun appeared when Agni (the fire) had been born\n[3](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:11:3).\n\n12\\. By the _Ri_ ta the immortal, uninjured [1](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:12:1)\ngoddesses, the Waters, O Agni, with their honey-sweet waves have sped forward\n[2](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:12:2) for ever to flow (along their course), like a\nracer incited by shouting when (the race-horses) are let loose.\n\n13\\. Go never on thy crooked way to the spirit (which avenges the guilt) of\nanybody [1](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:13:1), of a vassal who has trespassed, or of a\nfriend. Require not (of us),a sinful brother's debt\n[2](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:13:2). May we not have to suffer under the spirit\nwhich avenges a friend's or a (hostile) deceiver's guilt\n[3](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:13:3).\n\np. 327\n\n14\\. Protect us, O Agni, with all thy protection, thou who art protected, O\nmartial one [1](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:14:1), and art gladdened (by us). Sparkle\nforth, and destroy even strong evil! Slay the Rakshas even though it has grown\nlarge.\n\n15\\. Be gracious, O Agni, through these our hymns. Touch, O hero, this wealth\nmoved by our prayers. And accept, O A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, our sacred words. May the praise,\nbeloved by the gods, resound to thee [1](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:15:1).\n\n16\\. I, the priest, have rehearsed to thee the omniscient one, O Agni,\nworshipper (of the gods), all these songs, these inmost words, these\nrecitations and words of wisdom, to thee the wise one, with prayers and hymns.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi and metre.--Verse 1 = SV. I, 69; TS. I, 3, 14, 1; TB. II, 8,\n6, 9; MS. IV, 11, 4. Verse 6 = MS. IV, 11, 4.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. On the identification of Agni with Rudra, comp. Bergaigne, Rel.\nVedique, III, 36; von Bradke, Dyaus Asura, p. 54 (Rig-veda I, 27, 10; III, 2,\n5; VIII, 72, 3).\n\nNote 2. The second Pada of this verse is identical with VI, 16, 46.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Cf. Hirzel, Gleichnisse and Metaphern im Rigveda, p. 69.\n\nNote 2. On parivita _h_ Saya _n_ a remarks, yash _t_ avyadevais te _g_ obhir\nva parivita _h_. In the commentary on I, 128, 1, on the other hand, he says,\n_ri_ tvigbhi _h_ paridhibhir va parito vesh _t_ ita _h_.\n\np. 328\n\nNote 3. I take su-apaka as a compound of su and a-paka (comp. Va _g_. Sa _m_\nh. XX, 44 = Taitt. Br. II, 6, 8, 4 = Maitr. Sa _m_ h. III, 11, 1, where Tvash\n_t_ _ri_ is called apaka _h_ ). In Rig-veda VI, 11, 4 we read: adidyutat su\napaka _h_ vibha\xc2\xb4va; in VI, 12, 2. a\xc2\xb4 yasmin tve su apake ya _g_ atra, &c.\nShould we not correct in both passages suapaka _h_ , suapake?\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. The pressing-stone (gra\xc2\xb4van) is frequently considered as speaking, as\npraising the gods. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, I, p. 152 sq.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. The Padapa _th_ a has _s_ amyai. I think it should be _s_ amya _h_.\n\nNote 2. I. e. to this sacrifice, which is considered as one of the chief\nmanifestations of _Ri_ ta. See H. O., Religion des Veda, p. 197.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. At the Soma sacrifice fire burns on eight altars called Dhish _n_ ya;\nsee Weber, Indische Studien, X, pp. 366, 375.\n\nNote 2. See vol. xxxii, p. 164.\n\nNote 3. This is the only passage in the Rig-veda in which nasatya occurs in\nthe singular.\n\nNote 4. On pari _g_ man, cf. above, I, 79, 3 note.\n\nNote 5. Kshe (cf. Lanman, pp. 440, 448, 534) is evidently corrupt. But neither\nBollensen's conjecture, uksh _n_ e, nor those of Ludwig ( _k_ akshe, yakshe),\ncarry conviction.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. It is very strange to find Rudra here designated as 'giver of\nofferings.' But it seems too bold to explain havi _h_ -de as a dative of havi\n_h_ -ad ('eater of offerings').\n\nNote 2. I read with Grassmann repa _h_ ('sin') for reta _h_ ('sperm').\n\np. 329\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. The text has _ri_ ta\xc2\xb4ya, used as an adjective (see Bergaigne, Rel.\nVedique, III, 216).\n\nNote 2. Aditi is masculine and seems to be an epithet ('unrestrained, free')\nof the Sun. Cf. vol. xxxii, p. 262; Bergaigne, III, 92. Probably at the same\ntime the word is intended to allude to the goddess Aditi.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. The text has i _l_ e, on which Ludwig says, 'so viel wie ni _l_ e.' \xc3\x8e\n_l_ e of course cannot be the same as ni _l_ e, but should we not conjecture\nni _l_ e? Cf. above, IV, 1, 11. v _ri_ shabhasya ni _l_ e, and IV, 1, 12. _ri_\ntasya yona v _ri_ shabhasya ni _l_ e. The translation would be, 'By _Ri_ ta\nthe _Ri_ ta is restrained in the nest of the cow.'\n\nNote 2. The ' _Ri_ ta of the cow,' if the reading is correct (see note 1),\nseems to be the milk.\n\nNote 3. The 'raw one' is the cow as opposed to the ripe milk.\n\nNote 4. The meaning of _g_ a\xc2\xb4marya (\xe1\xbc\x85\xcf\x80\xce\xb1\xce\xbe \xce\xbb\xce\xb5\xce\xb3\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xbc\xce\xb5\xce\xbd\xce\xbf\xce\xbd) is unknown. Cf. Bergaigne.\nII, 398, note 1. Saya _n_ a reads _g_ a amarye _n_ a. 'I should prefer _g_ a\namartyena.' M. M.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. Does this mean, with the milk that comes from the ridge of heaven? Cf.\nIV, 20, 4. sam andhasa mamada _h_ p _ri_ sh _th_ y\xcc\x83ena.\n\nNote 2. This Pada seems to be an imitation of VI, 66, 1, where P _ri_ _s_ ni\n('the speckled one') is the mother of the Maruts: sak _r i_t _s_ ukram duduhe\np _ri_ _s_ ni _h_ u\xc2\xb4dha _h_. See vol. xxxii, p. 368.\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. Here we have again the same myth of the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras and the cows, to which\nso many allusions are found in the preceding hymns.\n\nNote 2. The red cows of the myth are the dawns; the\n\np. 330\n\n[paragraph continues] A\xe1\xb9\x85giras besiege the stronghold in which these cows are\nimprisoned.\n\nNote 3. On the kindling of the fire as a charm by which the sun is made to\nrise, see H. O., Religion des Veda, p. 109 seq. The A\xe1\xb9\x85giras kindle the fire\nfor performing their sacrifice; thereby they make the sun rise.\n\n##### Verse 12.\n\nNote 1. The same epithet is applied to the waters also in X, 104, 8.\n\nNote 2. The optative dadhanyu _h_ is very strange. Probably we ought to read\ndadhanvu _h_.\n\n##### Verse 13.\n\nNote 1. The meaning seems to be that Agni is requested not to turn against the\nsacrificer a spirit which has to avenge the guilt committed by a third person.\n'Why not read ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ am? Go not secretly to anybody's sacrifice, not of a\nhostile house, not of a friend. Do not require (of us) a sinful brother's\ndebt. May we not feel the might of friend or foe.' M. M.\n\nNote 2. Geldner (Ved. Studien II, 157) translates and interprets: 'tilge\nnicht, O Agni, die Schuld eines falschen Bruders,' namlich die Schuld an die\nManen, also dem Sinn nach 'mache ihn kinderlos.' This is quite unacceptable.\n\nNote 3. The text is evidently corrupt. I propose to read: ma\xc2\xb4 sakhyu _h_\nyaksham ma\xc2\xb4 ripo _h_ bhu _g_ ema. Comp. V, 70, 4. ma\xc2\xb4 kasya adbhutakratu\nyaksham bhu _g_ ema tanu\xc2\xb4bhi _h_.\n\n##### Verse 14.\n\nNote 1. I cannot adopt Bergaigne's opinion on sumakha (Quarante Hymnes, p.\n75).\n\n##### Verse 15.\n\nNote 1. Or, awake for thee.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 4](sbe46093.htm)\n\n"
