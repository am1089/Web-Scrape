Such\nworks as the Agnihotra must be performed, since there is no possibility of\ntheir results not clinging; for him who knows, those works have knowledge for\ntheir exclusive effect. This we learn from Scripture itself: 'Him Brahma _n_\nas seek to know by the study of the Veda, by sacrifices, gifts, austerities,\nand fasting.' This passage shows that works such as the Agnihotra give rise to\nknowledge, and as knowledge in order to grow and become more perfect has to be\npractised day after day until death, the special duties of the a _s_ rama\nalso, which assist the rise of knowledge, have daily to be performed.\nOtherwise, those duties being omitted, the mind would lose its clearness and\nknowledge would not arise.--But if good works such as the Agnihotra only serve\nthe purpose of giving rise to knowledge, and if good works previous to the\nrise of knowledge\n\np. 726\n\nperish, according to the texts 'Having dwelt there till their works are\nconsumed' ( _Kh_.
