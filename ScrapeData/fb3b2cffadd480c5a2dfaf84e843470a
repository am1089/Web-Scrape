Naraya _n_ a said :-- In Harivar _s_ a, the Bhagavan Hari is shining\nsplendid as a Yogi in the form of Narasimha. The Maha Bhagavat (most devoted)\nPrahlada, who knows the attributes of God worships and chants hymns with his\nwhole hearted devotion, seeing that beautiful form, gladdening to all the\npeople.\n\n\n\np. 759\n\n\n\n3-11. Prahlada spoke :-- I bow down to Thee, the Bhagavan Nrisi _n_ gha Deva.\nThou art the Light of all Lights. Thy big teeth are like thunderbolts. Let\nThee manifest in Thy most terrible form. Let Thee destroy the desires of the\npeople to do Karma and let Thou devour the great Ignorance (Aj\xc3\xb1ana) the Moha\n(delusion) of the people. Thou art the receptacle of the Sattva, Raja and Tamo\nGu _n_ as. Let myself be always free from any fear by Thy Grace. \xc2\x93Om Khraum!\xc2\x94\nLet this whole world rest completely in peace and happiness. Let the cheats\nquit their guiles and be pure and simple. Let all the people quit completely\ntheir animosities towards each other and think of their welfare. Let all the\npeople be free from making injuries to others and be peaceful; and let them\nhave their control over their passions. Let our mind be completely free from\ndesires and rest entirely and devotedly to Thy lotus-feet. Let us not be\nattached to sons, wives, wealth, house or to any other worldly objects. If\nthere be any attachment, let it be to the objects dear to the Bhagavan. He who\nbarely sustains his body and soul and controls himself completely, success is\nvery near to him; not so to the persons that are attached to the senses. The\ndirt of the mind, that is not washed away by bathing in the Ganges or by\ntaking recourse to the Tirthas, etc., is removed by the company of the\ndevotees to the God and by their influence, hearing, thinking, and meditating\non the attributes of the Bhagavan. So who is there that does not serve the\nBhagavan! He who has got Niskama Bhakti (devotion without regard to any fruits\nthereof) to the Bhagavan, to him come always the Devata, Dharma and J\xc3\xb1ana and\nother higher qualities. But he who indulges in various mental phantasms,\nwithout any Bhakti to the Bhagavan, he follows the worldly happiness that is\ncertainly to be hated and never he gets Vairagyan and other higher qualities.\nAs water is life to the fish, so the Bhagavan Hari is the self of all embodied\nbeings and so He is to be specially prayed for. So if a high-souled person be\nattached to household happiness, without thinking of God, then his greatness\ndwindles into a trifling insignificance like the ordinary pleasures of man and\nwoman when they are full of youth. So leave, at once, the home that is the\nsource of Birth and Death and leave Tri _sn_ a (thirst, desire), clinging to\nlife, low-spiritedness, name, and fame, egoism, shame, fear, poverty and loss\nof one's honour and worship the Lotus-Feet of the Bhagavan Nrisi _n_ gha Deva\nand be entirely fearless. Thus Prahlada, the Lord of the Daityas, daily\nworships devotedly the Bhagavan Nrisi _n_ gha, resplendent in his lotus heart,\nthe death blow, the lion to all the elephant sins. In the Ketumala Var _s_ a,\nthe Bhagavan Naraya _n_ a is reigning in the form of the Kama Deva, the God of\nLove. The people there always worship Him. The daughter of Ocean, the Indira\nDevi, who confers honour and glory to the Mahatmas,\n\n\n\np. 760\n\n\n\nis the presiding Deity of the Var _s_ a. She always worships the Kama Deva\nwith the following verses :--\n\n\n\n12-18. The Lak _s_ mi Devi spoke :-- \xc2\x93Om, Hram, Hrim, Hrum, Om namo Bhagavate\nHri _s_ ike _s_ aya! Thou art the Bhagavan of the nature of Om. Thou are the\nDirector, the Lord of the senses: Thy \xc3\x82tman is the Highest and the Receptacle\nof all the good things. All the Karma V _r_ ittis, all the J\xc3\xb1ana V _r_ ittis,\nand effort and resolution and other faculties of the mind, act in their\nrespective channels by Thy looking and by their being constantly practised in\nThee. And the elements over which they get their masteries are subservient to\nThy Laws. The mind and the other eleven Indriyas, and touch, taste and other\nfive senses are but Thy parts. All the rites and ceremonies observed in the\nVedas are found in Thee. Thou art the infinite store of all the foodings of\nthe Jivas. From Thee flows the Paramananda, the Highest Bliss. Thou art All,\nThou art the Substance, Purity incarnate; Thou art the Energy, the Strength\nmanifest in all. Thou art the Finish of all the happiness and Thou art the\nOnly One Substance, that can be desired by the people. So obeisance to Thee!\nThis Thy Lordship is not dependent on any other body. The women that know\nThee, the Lord of all and worship other bodies for their husbands, those\nhusbands can never save them, their lives, their wealth, progeny or other dear\nthings as those are controlled by Kala (Time) and Karma. So they cannot be\ntermed husbands at all; Thou art the Real Husband; and no other. For Thou art\nnaturally fearless and Thou protectest in every way the persons that become\nafraid. Thou art the Lord of all wealth; so no other is superior to Thee. How\ncan then, they be independent whose happiness depends on others! The lady that\ndesires to worship Thy lotus feet only and becomes subservient to no others,\nshe attains all the desires. Again the lady who, desiring other desires than\nto get Thee, does not worship Thy lotus-feet, Thou fulfillest the desires of\nher too. But, O Bhagavan! When the period of enjoyment of these things ceases\nand when the objects of these enjoyments are destroyed, then she repents much\ndue to the loss of those things. Brahma, Mahadeva, the Suras and the Asuras\npractise hard Tapasyas to get me, impelled by their desires to attain the\nobjects of sense enjoyments; but he only really gets me who worships and takes\nrefuge of Thy lotus feet only, for my heart is entirely attached to Thee. So,\nO Achyuta! Kindly shew Thy Grace and put, on my head, Thy lotus palm, praised\nby the universal people that Thou placest on Thy Bhaktas. O Bhagavan! That\nThou takest me in Thy Bosom is a sign of Thy Grace. No one can fathom the\ndeeds of Thee, the Only Controller of all. Thus the Prajapati and the Lords of\nthat Var _s_ a, worship the Bhagavan,\n\n\n\np. 761\n\n\n\nthe Friend of all, with a view to attain their respective desires and Siddhis.\nIn Ramyak Var _s_ a, the Matsya form of the Bhagavan is set up and\nconsecrated. The Suras and the Asuras worship Him. The highly intelligent Manu\nalways chant hymns to that Excellent Form thus :-- \xc2\x93Obeisance to Him who is\nthe Life of all, the Essence and Strength of all, to that Great Fish Form, the\nBody Incarnate of Sattva Gu _n_ a, who is of the nature of Om and Bliss.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n19-23. Thou art the Lord of all the Lokapalas and of the form of the Vedas.\nThou art within and without all this universe, moving and non-moving; still\nall the beings are unable to see Thy form. As the people bring under their\ncontrol the wooden dolls, so Thou controllest the universe by the rules and\nprohibitions under the names of the Brahma _n_ as, etc. Thou art the God. The\nLokapalas, being overcome by the fever of jealousy and pride, become quite\nunable, either individually or collectively, to quit their jealousies and to\nprotect the tripeds, quadrupeds, reptiles and snakes; so Thou art the God.\nThou hadst upheld this earth along with me and with the medicinal plants and\ncreepers; and Thou shewedest the highest luminous light in the great ocean, at\nthe time of Pralaya, tossed with surging waves and didst roam there. Thou art\nthe Self of all the beings in the universe. So we bow down to Thee. Thus the\nManu, the best of the mortal beings, used to praise the Bhagavan, who took His\nincarnation in the shape of the Fish, the Remover of all doubts. Manu, the\nforemost of the Bhagavatas (the devotees) is reigning there in the service of\nthe Fish Incarnation of the Bhagavan, with intense meditation and expurging\nall sins and with great devotion.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Ninth Chapter of the Eighth Book on the narration of the\ndivision of the continents in the Maha Pura _n_ am S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of\n18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 10](bk08ch10.htm)\n\n"
