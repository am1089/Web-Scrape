Standing he puts it (the pan) on the fire, for the fire-pan is\nthese worlds, and these worlds stand, as it were. And, moreover, whilst\nstanding one is strongest.\n\n6:6:2:22\\. Standing (with his face) towards north-east, for standing towards\nnorth-east Pra _g_ apati created creatures.\n\n6:6:2:33\\. And, again, why (he does so) standing towards north-east;--that\n(quarter), the north-east, is the quarter of both gods and men.\n\n6:6:2:44\\. And, again, why standing towards north-east,--in that quarter is\nthe gate of the world of heaven, hence it is standing with his face towards\nnortheast that one offers libations, and standing towards north-east that one\nleads up the dakshi _n_ as: it is by the gate that he thus makes him enter\ninto the world of heaven.\n\np. 253\n\n6:6:2:55\\. [Va _g_. S. XI, 68] 'Break not! Suffer not injury!'--as the text,\nso its meaning;--'O mother, bear up bravely!'--for the fire-pan (ukha, f.) is\na woman; and 'O mother' is a term for addressing a woman: 'bear up well,\nindeed!'--(Thou) and Agni will do this (work)!'--for (the fire-pan) and Agni\nwill indeed be doing this (sacred work).\n\n6:6:2:66\\. [Va _g_. S. XI, 69] 'Stand firm, divine Earth, for our well-being!'\nas the text, so its meaning;--'A divine (asura) contrivance thou art made in\nthe wonted manner;'--the vital spirit (asu) is the breath, and this (are-pan)\nhas indeed been made its contrivance in the wonted manner;--'May this offering\nbe agreeable to the gods!' he thereby means those libations which he intends\nto offer in that fire; and moreover, that (fire-pan) itself is an\noffering;--'unharmed rise thou in this sacrifice!' this he says with the view\nthat it may rise unharmed, uninjured, in this sacrifice.\n\n6:6:2:77\\. With two (verses) he heats it on the fire,--the Sacrificer is two-\nfooted, and the Sacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his\nmeasure, by so much he thus heats it (the pan). [He does so] with a gayatri\nand a trish _t_ ubh verse,--the Gayatri is the vital air, and the Trish _t_\nubh the body; and the animal is as much as the vital air and the body: thus by\nas much as the animal (consists of) he puts that (pan) on the fire. And,\nagain, the Gayatri is Agni, and the Trish _t_ ubh is Indra; and the fire\nrelates to Indra and Agni: as great as the fire is, as great as is its\nmeasure, by so much he thus heats it. These two (verses) have seven feet (viz.\nthree and four respectively),--the fire-altar consists of seven\n\np. 254\n\nlayers 1; seven seasons are a year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is,\nas great as is his measure, so great does this become.\n\n6:6:2:88\\. When the fire heats it, then the flame mounts up to it; for the\nfire-pan is a female, and the fire is a male: hence when the male heats the\nfemale, he infuses seed into her.\n\n6:6:2:99\\. Now, if the flame is too long in mounting up, some throw coals on\n(the pan), thinking, 'There is fire now on both sides.' But let him not do so;\nfor the animal is indeed born with bones 2; but it is not forced in with\nbones, as it were, at first; but it is introduced only as seed. Now that flame\nis boneless seed: hence the flame alone should mount up to it.\n\n6:6:2:1010\\. When the flame mounts up to it, he places a kindling-stick\nthereon: thereby the seed enters it (the fire-pan), and that fire imparts\ngrowth to that seed (in the shape of) this (kindling-stick).\n\n6:6:2:1111\\. It should be one of k _ri_ muka wood. Now, the gods and the\nAsuras, both of them sprung from Pra _g_ apati, strove together. The gods,\nhaving placed Agni in front, went up to the Asuras. The Asuras cut off the\npoint of that flame held forward. It settled down on this earth, and became\nthat k _ri_ muka tree: hence it is sweet, for there is vital essence (in it).\nHence also it is red, for it is a flame, that k _ri_ muka\n\np. 255\n\ntree being the same as this Agni: it is (in the shape of) fire that he imparts\ngrowth to it.\n\n6:6:2:1212\\. It (the kindling-stick) is a span long, for Vish _n_ u, as an\nembryo, was a span long: he thus imparts to it growth equal to his body.\n\n6:6:2:1313\\. It is soaked in ghee;--the inner membrane of the womb from which\nAgni was produced consisted of ghee: hence he now blazes up towards it, for it\n(the stick) is his self (body); and hence it (the k _ri_ muka) has no ashes:\n(Agni) himself now enters into his own self,--to avoid injury 1, for the inner\nmembrane does not injure the embryo; and it is from the inner membrane that he\nwho is born is born: 'When he (Agni) is born, may he be born from the inner\nmembrane!' thus he thinks.\n\n6:6:2:1414\\. He puts it (the kindling-stick) on, with (Va _g_. S. XI, 60; _Ri_\nk S. II, 7, 6), 'The wood-eating, ghee-drinking,'--that is, he who has wood\nfor his food, and ghee for his drink,--'the primeval, desirable Hot _ri_ ,'--\nthat is, 'the old, desirable Hot _ri_ ;'--'the wonderful son of power,'--power\nis strength: thus, 'the wonderful son of strength.' Standing he puts it on\nwith the 'Svaha:' the meaning of this (will be explained) hereafter 2.\n\n6:6:2:1515\\. Now the fire-pan is the body, the reed-grass (fuel) the womb, the\nhemp the inner membrane 3,\n\np. 256\n\nthe ghee the outer membrane, and the kindling-stick the embryo.\n\n6:6:2:1616\\. The pan is outside, and the reed-grass (fuel) is inside; for the\nbody is outside, and the womb inside. The reed-grass is outside, and the hemp\ninside; for the womb is outside, and the outer membrane is inside. The hemp is\noutside, and the ghee is inside; for the outer membrane is outside, and the\ninner membrane is inside. The ghee is outside, and the kindling-stick is\ninside; for the inner membrane is outside, and the embryo is inside. It is\nfrom these that he who is born is born, and from them he thus causes him\n(Agni) to be born.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[254:1](sbe4146.htm#fr_491) See [p. 249](sbe4145.htm#page_249), note\n[3](sbe4145.htm#fn_486).\n\n[254:2](sbe4146.htm#fr_492) The fire ultimately to be placed on the new\nGarhapatya hearth ([VII, 1, 1, 1](sbe4155.htm#7:1:1:1) seq.)--whence the\n\xc3\x82havaniya on the great fire-altar has to be kindled--is to be produced in the\nukha, or pan, as it were in its womb; but the material (grass and hemp) which\nhas already been put in the pan, is only to be kindled by the blaze of the\nfire on which the pan has been placed, without any burning coals being applied\nto the fuel within the pan.\n\n[255:1](sbe4146.htm#fr_493) The dative 'ahi _m_ sayai' again doubtless belongs\nto the first sentence of the paragraph ('it is soaked in ghee'), the\nintervening clauses being inserted for explanation. For a similar\nconstruction, see above, [p. 198](sbe4134.htm#page_198), note\n[2](sbe4134.htm#fn_407).\n\n[255:2](sbe4146.htm#fr_494) See [VI, 7, 2, 1](sbe4150.htm#6:7:2:1).\n\n[255:3](sbe4146.htm#fr_495) The inverted order of the words ' _s_ a _n_ a _g_\narayu' is peculiar. It seems to have been resorted to with the view of keeping\ntogether the two pairs of subjects, 'mu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ a _h_ - _s_ a _n_ a _h_ ' and\n' _g_ arayu-ulbam.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 6, 3.
