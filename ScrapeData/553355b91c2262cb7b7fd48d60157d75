Verily, by means of the Great Oblation the gods slew V _ri_ tra,\nand gained that supreme authority which they now wield. And by means of the\nsacrifice to the fathers they then recalled to life those of them that had\nbeen slain in this battle; and they, indeed, were the fathers: hence the name\nPit _ri_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a 1 (sacrifice to the Manes).\n\n2:6:1:22\\. Now the spring, the summer, and the rainy season,--they are those\nwho vanquished (V _ri_ tra); and the autumn, the winter, and the dewy season,\n--they are those whom they (the gods) recalled to life 2.\n\n2:6:1:33\\. Now when he performs that sacrifice, he does so, hoping that thus\nthey (the Asuras) will not slay any of his, or because the gods did so\n(perform it). Moreover he thereby offers to those (fathers) the share which\nthe gods assigned to them; and thus he gratifies those whom the gods recalled\nto life, and leads his own fathers up to a better world; and whatever injury\nor loss he suffers through his own unrighteous conduct (or wrong sacrificial\nperformance) 3 that is thereby made good to him: that is why he performs this\nsacrifice (to the fathers).\n\np. 421\n\n2:6:1:44\\. He offers a cake on six potsherds to the Pitara _h_ Somavanta _h_ ,\nor to Soma Pit _ri_ mat 1. Six doubtless are the seasons, and the fathers are\nthe seasons: hence it is one of six potsherds.\n\n2:6:1:55\\. Thereupon they parch barley-grain on the Anvaharyapa _k_ ana (or\nDakshi _n_ agni) for the Pitaro Barhishada _h_  2. They then grind one half of\nit; and (the other) half remains thus unground,--this is the parched grain for\nthe Barhis-seated fathers.\n\n2:6:1:66\\. Then a porridge is (prepared) for the Pitaro \'gnishvatta _h_  3 (by\nthe ground half of the parched grain) being mixed with the milk of a cow\nsuckling an adopted calf, by stirring it once with a single splinter. It is\nindeed once for all that the fathers have departed, and hence is stirred but\nonce. These are the oblations.\n\n2:6:1:77\\. Now those (fathers) who have sacrificed with Soma are the Pitara\n_h_ Somavanta _h_ ; and those who gain the world (of the gods) by means of\ncooked (sacrificial food) offered by them are the Pitaro Barhishada _h_ ; and\nthey who (have offered) neither the one nor the other, and whom Agni consumes\nby burning, they are the Pitaro \'gnishvatta _h_. These, then, are the fathers\n4.\n\n2:6:1:88\\. He takes out [the rice for] that cake of six potsherds, while\nseated behind the Garhapatya, and looking southwards, with the sacrificial\ncord over his right shoulder. From thence he rises and\n\np. 422\n\nthreshes (the rice), while standing north of the Dakshi _n_ a-fire, with his\nface towards the south. He cleans it but once 1; since it is once for all that\nthe fathers have departed.\n\n2:6:1:99\\. He places the two mill-stones on (the black antelope skin, so as to\nbe inclined) towards the south 2; and puts the six potsherds on the south part\nof the Garhapatya hearth. The reason why they keep the southern direction is\nbecause that is the region of the fathers: this is why they keep the southern\ndirection.\n\n2:6:1:1010\\. Thereupon he raises a square altar south of the Dakshi _n_ agni\n3. He makes the corners point towards the intermediate quarters. There are\ndoubtless four intermediate quarters, and the fathers are the intermediate\nquarters: this is why he makes the corners point towards the intermediate\nquarters.\n\n2:6:1:1111\\. In the centre of this (altar) he lays down the fire. From the\neast, indeed, the gods came westwards to the men: hence one offers to them\nwhile standing\n\np. 423\n\nwith his face towards the east. On all sides are the fathers, for the fathers\nare the intermediate regions, and the intermediate regions are indeed on all\nsides: this is why he lays down the fire in the centre.\n\n2:6:1:1212\\. From thence he throws the grass-bush (stambaya _g_ us) eastwards\n1. Having thrown away the grass-bush, he first encloses (the altar) thus (viz.\non the west side), then thus (viz. on the north side), then thus (on the east\nside). Having enclosed it with the first line of enclosure, he (the Adhvaryu)\ndraws (three) lines (across the altar) 2 and [the \xc3\x82gnidhra] removes (from them\nthe dust) which has to be removed. In the same way he encloses it with the\nsecond line of enclosure; and having enclosed it with the second line of\nenclosure, and smoothed it down, he says, \'Place the sprinkling water on (the\naltar)!\' They accordingly place the sprinkling water on (the altar); and the\nfirewood and barhis they lay down beside it 3. He (the \xc3\x82gnidhra) wipes the\nspoons. He then walks up (to the altar) with the butter (and\n\np. 424\n\nputs it down thereon 1, north of the sprinkling water). He (the Adhvaryu)\ntakes butter, while \'sacrificially-invested 2.\'\n\n2:6:1:1313\\. Here now they say, \'Let him take butter in the upabh _ri_ t (by)\ntwice (ladling with the dipping spoon); since there are two after-offerings 3\nat this (sacrifice).\' Let him, nevertheless, ladle eight times into the upabh\n_ri_ t: let him do so, lest he should depart from the manner of the sacrifice.\nAfter ladling out butter, and shifting his cord back to the right shoulder,--\n\n2:6:1:1414\\. The Adhvaryu takes the lustral water, and sprinkles first the\nfirewood, and then the altar 4. Thereupon they hand the sacrificial grass 5 to\nhim, and he puts it down (on the altar) with the knot to the east. Having\nthereupon sprinkled it and\n\np. 425\n\npoured out (the lustral water on the lower ends of the grass-stalks), and\nuntied the knot, he (at once) seizes the knot, not the prastara 1;--it is once\nfor all that the fathers have departed: hence he does not take the prastara.\n\n2:6:1:1515\\. After undoing the band, he moves thrice 2 round from right to\nleft, spreading the sacrificial grass all over (the altar); while spreading it\nall over from right to left in three layers, he reserves as much as may serve\nfor the prastara-bunch. He then moves again thrice round (the altar) from left\nto right. The reason why he again moves thrice round from left to right, is\nthat, while the first time he went away from here after those three ancestors\nof his, he now cones back again from them to this, his own world: that is why\nhe again moves thrice round from left to right.\n\n2:6:1:1616\\. He lays the enclosing-sticks along (the fire, with their tops)\ntowards the south 3; and the prastara also he spreads (with the grass-tops)\ntowards the south; nor does he lay down the two vidh _ri_ tis between (the\nbarhis and the prastara). Once for all the fathers have departed from hence:\ntherefore he lays no vidh _ri_ tis between.\n\np. 426\n\n2:6:1:1717\\. Thereon he lays the _g_ uhu, and east of it (on the barhis) the\nupabh _ri_ t. Having then put down the dhruva, the cake, the parched grain,\nand the porridge (each east of the preceding one), he touches the oblations.\n\n2:6:1:1818\\. All of them having now become \'sacrificially-invested,\' the\nSacrificer and Brahman (being) thus (invested) walk round (from the east,\nalong the south) to the west side; and the \xc3\x82gnidhra (from the west) to the\neast side (of the fire) 1.\n\n2:6:1:1919\\. They perform this (sacrifice) in a low voice. Secret, indeed, are\nthe fathers, and secret also is (what is spoken) in a low voice: hence they\nperform (the offering) in a low voice.\n\n2:6:1:2020\\. They perform it in an enclosed place. Secret, indeed, are the\nfathers, and secret also is that which is enclosed: hence they perform in an\nenclosed place.\n\n2:6:1:2121\\. While putting firewood (on the fire), he then says (to the Hot\n_ri_ ), \'Recite to the fire, as it is being kindled!\' Only (this) one\nkindling-verse the Hot _ri_ recites 2, (and that) thrice;--the fathers have\ndeparted once for all: hence the Hot _ri_ recites thrice only one kindling-\nverse.\n\n2:6:1:2222\\. He recites, \'Loving we deposit thee (O Agni), loving we enkindle\nthee: O loving one, bring\n\np. 427\n\nhither the loving fathers to eat their oblation!\' Thereupon he says, \'Bring\nAgni hither 1! bring Soma hither! bring hither the fathers, accompanied by\nSoma! bring hither the fathers, seated on the barhis! bring hither the\nfathers, consumed by Agni! bring hither the butter-drinking gods! bring hither\nAgni for the Hot _ri_ ship! bring hither (thine) own greatness 2!\' Having thus\ncalled on (Agni) to bring hither (the fathers and gods), he sits down.\n\n2:6:1:2323\\. Having then called 3 for the (\xc3\x82gnidhra\'s) \' _S_ rausha _t_ ,\' he\ndoes not elect the Hot _ri_ ; for this being a sacrifice to the Manes, he does\nnot elect the Hot _ri_  4, lest he should consign the Hot _ri_ to the Manes.\nHe says, \'Hot _ri_ , seat thyself!\' and takes his seat. The Hot _ri_ , having\nsat down on the Hot _ri_ \'s seat, urges (the Adhvaryu) to proceed; and thus\nurged, the Adhvaryu takes the two spoons and steps across to the west (of the\nfire); and having stepped across and called for the \' _S_ rausha _t_ ,\' he\nsays, \'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the kindling-sticks!\' He performs four\nfore-offerings 5,\n\np. 428\n\nomitting the one to the Barhis; for the barhis means offspring, and he\ntherefore performs the four fore-offerings without the one to the barhis, lest\nhe should consign his offspring to the fathers. Thereupon they proceed with\nthe two butter-portions; and having offered the two butter-portions,--\n\n2:6:1:2424\\. They all shift their sacrificial cord over to the right shoulder,\nbeing now about to proceed with those (chief) oblations. The Sacrificer and\nBrahman, (being) thus (invested), step across (from the west) to the east\nside, and the \xc3\x82gnidhra (from the east) to the west side (of the fire). And\nfurthermore, the (Adhvaryu\'s) call for the \' _S_ rausha _t_ \' is \' _\xc3\x95_ _m_\nsvadha!\' and the (\xc3\x82gnidhra\'s) response is \'Astu svadha 1!\' and the Vashat-call\nis \'Svadha nama _h_!\'\n\n2:6:1:2525\\. As to this, \xc3\x82suri said, \'Let them call for the Srausha _t_ (by "\xc3\x95\n_S_ ravaya"), and let them respond with the "(Astu) _S_ rausha _t_ ," and let\nthem pronounce the "Vashat," lest we should depart from the manner of the\nsacrifice.\'\n\n2:6:1:2626\\. [The Adhvaryu] then says, \'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to the\nfathers, accompanied by Soma!\' or \'--to Soma, accompanied by the fathers\'!--\nTwo invitatory prayers he (the Hot _ri_ ) pronounces (at the offerings),\nbecause it is with one that one moves the gods, and with two the fathers,\nsince the fathers have departed once (for all) 2: hence he pronounces two\ninvitatory prayers.\n\np. 429\n\n2:6:1:2727\\. [The Adhvaryu] makes an \'under-layer\' of butter (in the _g_ uhu\nor offering-spoon). He then cuts a piece from the cake, and together therewith\nsome of the parched grain and the porridge 1. This he puts down at the same\ntime (in the _g_ uhu); makes two sprinklings of butter thereon; and re-anoints\n(replenishes with butter, the parts of the sacrificial dishes from which he\nhas made) the cuttings. He does not walk over (to the south side of the fire);\nbut having risen and stepped up (to the fire) on the same side (where he was\nseated), and called (on the \xc3\x82gnidhra) for the \' _S_ rausha _t_ ,\' he says (to\nthe Hot _ri_ ), \'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the fathers, accompanied by\nSoma!\' and pours the oblation (into the fire) as soon as the Vasha _t_  2 has\nbeen uttered.\n\np. 430\n\n2:6:1:2828\\. Thereupon he says, \'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to the\nfathers, seated on the barhis!\' He then makes an under-layer of butter, takes\na \'cutting\' from (the north part of) the parched grain, and together therewith\nsome of the porridge and the cake; puts down all this at the same time (in the\n_g_ uhu); makes two sprinklings of butter thereon, and re-anoints (the places\nof) the cuttings. He does not walk across; but having stepped up (to the fire)\non the same side and called for the \' _S_ rausha _t_ ,\' he says, \'Pronounce\nthe offering-prayer to the fathers, seated on the barhis!\' and pours out the\noblation as soon as the Vashat has been uttered.\n\n2:6:1:2929\\. Thereupon he says, \'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to the\nfathers, consumed by the fire!\' He then makes an under-layer of butter, takes\na cutting from (the south part of) the porridge, and therewith some of the\ncake and the parched grains; puts down all this at the same time (in the _g_\nuhu); makes two sprinklings of butter thereon, and re-anoints (the places of)\nthe cuttings. He does not walk across; but having stepped up (to the fire) on\nthe same side, and called for the \' _S_ rausha _t_ ,\' he says, \'Pronounce the\noffering-prayer to the fathers, consumed by the fire!\' and pours out the\noblation as soon as the Vashat has been uttered.\n\n2:6:1:3030\\. Thereupon he says, \'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni\nKavyavahana!\' that being for (Agni as) the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t (\'maker of good\noffering\'). For to the gods indeed he is havyavahana (\'bearer of oblations\'),\nand to the fathers he is kavyavahana (\'the bearer of what is meet for the\nwise\'): hence he says, \'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni Kavyavahana!\'\n\np. 431\n\n2:6:1:3131\\. He makes an under-layer of butter (in the offering-spoon); then\ncuts a piece from (the front part of) the cake, and therewith some of the\nparched grain and the porridge; puts down all this at the same time; and makes\ntwo sprinklings of butter thereon. The (places from which he has made the)\ncuttings he does not replenish with butter, nor does he walk across; but\nhaving stepped up (to the fire) on the same side (where he was seated), and\ncalled for the \' _S_ rausha _t_ ,\' he says, \'Pronounce the offering-prayer to\nAgni Kavyavahana!\' and pours out the oblation, as soon as the Vasha _t_ has\nbeen uttered.\n\n2:6:1:3232\\. Now the reason why he does not walk across (to the ordinary place\nof offering), but pours out the oblation after stepping up (to the fire) on\nthe sane side, is that the fathers have departed once for all; and the reason\nalso, why he cuts but once from each of the sacrificial dishes, is that the\nfathers have departed once for all. And the reason why in making the cuttings,\nhe keeps them together, is that the fathers are the seasons;--he thus keeps\nthe seasons together, joins them to one another: that is why in making the\ncuttings, he keeps them together.\n\n2:6:1:3333\\. Here now some hand over that entire (remaining) porridge to the\nHot _ri_ ; and the Hot _ri_ , having invoked it 1, smells it and hands it to\nthe\n\np. 432\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahman. The Brahman smells it and hands it to the\n\xc3\x82gnidhra; and the \xc3\x82gnidhra also smells it. And so indeed they do this. But, as\nfrom any other oblation they cut off the Ida and the fore-portion, so let them\ncut from this also; and having invoked it (the I _d_ a) they smell it, but do\nnot eat it. \'But,\' said \xc3\x82suri, \'we think that some should be eaten, of\nwhatever is offered up in the fire.\'\n\n2:6:1:3434\\. Now he who is about to present (the obsequial cakes to the\nfathers),--either the Adhvaryu or the Sacrificer,--takes the vessel of water\nand walks thrice round (the altar) from right to left sprinkling all about\n(the altar). He then, with the text, \'N.N., wash thyself 1!\' pours out water\n(in the north-west corner of the altar) for the Sacrificer\'s father 2 to wash\nhimself; and (in the southwest corner), with \'N.N., wash thyself!\' for the\ngrandfather; and (in the south-east corner), with \'N.N., wash thyself!\' for\nthe great-grandfather.\n\np. 433\n\n[paragraph continues] As one would pour out water for (a guest) who is to take\nfood with him, so in this case.\n\n2:6:1:3535\\. Thereupon he takes one \'cutting\' from the cake and puts it in his\nleft hand; from the parched grain also he takes one cutting and puts it in his\nleft hand; and from the porridge also he takes one cutting and puts it in his\nleft hand.\n\n2:6:1:3636\\. And in the corner (of the altar) opposite this intermediate\nquarter (viz. the north-west), he then presents (an obsequial cake 1) to the\nSacrificer\'s father, with the formula, \'N.N., this for thee!\' And in the\ncorner opposite this intermediate quarter (the south-west), he presents one to\nthe Sacrificer\'s grandfather, with \'N.N., this for thee!\' And in the corner\nopposite this intermediate quarter (the southeast), he presents one to the\nSacrificer\'s great-grandfather, with \'N.N., this for thee!\' And in the corner\nopposite this intermediate quarter (the northeast), he cleanses (his hands),\nwith the text (Va _g_. S. II, 31), \'Here, O Fathers, regale yourselves! Like\nbulls come hither, each to his own share!\' whereby he means to say, \'Eat ye\neach his share!\' And the reason why he thus presents (food) to the Fathers is\nthat in this way he does not exclude his own fathers from this sacrifice.\n\n2:6:1:3737\\. Thereupon they all, being sacrificially invested, walk out (of\nthe shed) on the north side, (pass along the east side of, and) stand by the\n(north) side of, the \xc3\x82havaniya fire. For he who has established his fires, and\nperforms the New and Full-moon sacrifices, approaches the gods; but they have\njust been\n\np. 434\n\nperforming the sacrifice to the Manes, and therefore they now propitiate the\ngods.\n\n2:6:1:3838\\. They stand by the \xc3\x82havaniya fire (worshipping) with two (verses)\naddressed to Indra [viz. Rig-veda I, 82, 2-3; Va _g_. S. III, 51-52], since\nthe \xc3\x82havaniya is Indra. \'The friends have eaten, and regaled themselves, and\nhave shaken off (the enemies) 1; the self-shining bards have extolled (thee)\nwith their newest hymn: yoke, then, thy pair of bay steeds, O Indra!--To thee,\nthe splendid, we will sing praises, O bountiful one! Thus praised, do thou now\nissue forth, with well-filled car, agreeably to our desire! yoke, then, thy\npair of bay steeds, O Indra!\'\n\n2:6:1:3939\\. Thereupon they return to the Garhapatya and stand by it\nworshipping with the verses (Rig-veda X, 57,3-5; Va _g_. S. III, 53-55), \'We\ninvoke the Mind with man-lauding strain 2, and with the hymns of the fathers.\n--May the Mind come back to us for (us to obtain) wisdom, vigour, and life,\nand that we may long see the sun!--May the divine race restore to us the Mind,\nO Fathers, that we may abide with the living kind!\' They have indeed been\nperforming the sacrifice to the Manes; but now they return to the (land of\nthe) living: hence he says, \'That we may abide with the living kind!\'\n\n2:6:1:4040\\. Thereupon he who has presented (the obsequial cakes) again shifts\nhis sacrificial cord to the right shoulder and betakes. himself (to the fire\nin the shed), and mutters (Va _g_. S. II, 31), \'The\n\np. 435\n\n[paragraph continues] Fathers have regaled themselves: like bulls they came\neach to his share:\' whereby he means to say, \'they have eaten each his own\nshare.\'\n\n2:6:1:4141\\. He now takes the vessel of water and again, while sprinkling,\nwalks thrice round (the altar) from left to right (sunwise). With \'N.N., wash\nthyself!\' he pours out water (in the respective corner) for the Sacrificer\'s\nfather to wash himself; with \'N.N., wash thyself!\' for the grandfather; with\n\'N.N., wash thyself!\' for the great-grandfather. As one would pour out water\nfor (a guest) who has taken food with him, so in this case. And as to his\nagain walking thrice round from left to right, while sprinkling,--they think,\n\'This holy work of ours shall be accomplished sunwise 1,\' and hence he walks\nthrice round from left to right, while sprinkling.\n\n2:6:1:4242\\. He then pulls down the tuck (of the nether garment) 2 and makes\nobeisance (to the Fathers). The tuck, doubtless, is sacred to the Fathers:\nhence he makes obeisance to them after pulling down the tuck; and obeisance\nmeans worship: hence he thereby recognises them as entitled to worship. Six\ntimes he makes obeisance to them, since there are six seasons, and the Fathers\nare the seasons: hence he thereby establishes his sacrifice in the seasons,--\nthat is why he makes obeisance six times 3. \'Give houses\n\np. 436\n\nunto us; O Fathers!\' he (further) says, because the Fathers are the guardians\nof houses;--and this is the prayer for blessing at this sacred performance.\n\n2:6:1:4343\\. Being now about to proceed with the after-offerings, they all\ninvest themselves sacrificially (by shifting the cord over to the left\nshoulder); and thus (invested) the Sacrificer and Brahman walk round to the\nwest, and the \xc3\x82gnidhra to the east, side; and the Hot _ri_ sits down on the\nHot _ri_ \'s seat.\n\n2:6:1:4444\\. He (the Adhvaryu) then says, \'Brahman, I shall step forward.\'\nThereupon he puts the stick (reserved at the time of kindling) on (the fire),\nand says, \'Agnidh, trim the fire!\' He then takes the two spoons and crosses\nover to the west side. After crossing over and calling for the \' _S_ rausha\n_t_ ,\' he says (to the Hot _ri_ ), \'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the\ngods!\' He performs two after-offerings, omitting the one to the Barhis; for\nthe Barhis means offspring: hence he performs two after-offerings, omitting\nthe one to the Barhis, lest he should consign his offspring to the Fathers.\n\n2:6:1:4545\\. He then separates the two spoons 1, after laying them down (in\ntheir respective places on the altar); and having separated them, and anointed\nthe enclosing-sticks, he takes one enclosing-stick, calls for the \' _S_ rausha\n_t_ ,\' and says, \'The divine Hot _ri_ s are summoned for the proclamation of\nsuccess, the human is called upon for the song of praise!\' The Hot _ri_\nintones the \'song of praise (suktavaka).\' The Adhvaryu, on the other hand,\ndoes not seize the prastara-bunch, but watches while the Hot _ri_ recites the\nsong of praise.\n\np. 437\n\n2:6:1:4646\\. Thereupon the \xc3\x82gnidhra says, \'Throw it after 1!\' He (the\nAdhvaryu) throws nothing after, but silently touches himself.\n\n2:6:1:4747\\. He (the \xc3\x82gnidhra) then says, \'Discourse together!\' [The Adhvaryu\nasks], \'Has he gone (to the gods), Agnidh?\'--\'He has gone!\'--\'Bid (the gods)\nhear!\'--\'May one (or, they) hear!\'--\'Goodspeed to the divine Hot _ri_ s!\nSuccess to the human!--Pronounce the All-hail and blessing!\' Thus saying, he\nmerely touches the enclosing-sticks, but does not (now) throw them (into the\nfire). The Barhis and enclosing-sticks he throws in afterwards 2.\n\n2:6:1:4848\\. And here some throw also the remaining sacrificial food into the\nfire; but let him not do so; for that (remaining havis) is the residue of an\noffering; and lest he should offer the residue of an offering, let them (the\npriests) rather throw it into the water or eat it.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[420:1](sbe1260.htm#fr_942) This is generally called the Mahapit _ri_ ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ a, as distinguished from the ordinary monthly Pit _ri_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a of the\nnew-moon sacrifice; for which see II, 4, 2, I seq.\n\n[420:2](sbe1260.htm#fr_943) See II, 1, 3, 1 seq.\n\n[420:3](sbe1260.htm#fr_944) Instead of \'a _k_ ara _n_ ena,\' the Ka _n_ va MS.\nhas \' _k_ ara _n_ ena (!).\' Cf.

Inside it he prepares a quadrangular altar (of the same size as at the\nDar _s_ apur _n_ amasa; cf. I, 2, 5, 14) with the corners towards the\nintermediate quarters, in the centre of which he makes the (new) Dakshi _n_\nagni hearth. [According to Taitt. Br. I, 6, 8, 5-6 no digging takes place in\npreparing the altar (which is to be square) at the Pit _ri_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a.]\nWhen the Dakshi _n_ a-fire is transferred to the new fire-place, the Pra _n_\nita-water (see [p. 9](sbe1203.htm#page_9), note) is carried after it, followed\nby the Brahman and Sacrificer, and placed east (not north) of the hearth. The\nlaying down of the fire is preceded by the usual fivefold lustration of the\nhearth (see [p. 2](sbe1203.htm#page_2)).\n\n[423:1](sbe1260.htm#fr_952) Instead of northwards, as is done at the normal\nish _t_ i; see I, 2, 4, 12 seq.\n\n[423:2](sbe1260.htm#fr_953) After tracing the first line of enclosure, the\nAdhvaryu draws three lines across the altar, either from west to east or from\nsouth to north; and says to the \xc3\x82gnidhra, \'Take thrice!\' The latter then takes\nthe dust from the lines and throws it on the utkara (the heap of rubbish,\nformed north of the altar in preparing the latter), and thereupon again\nobliterates them. According to Katy. II, 6, 29, the same ceremony may be\nperformed at the Dar _s_ apur _n_ amasa; but there no mention is made of it by\nour author (see I, 2, 5, 12).\n\n[423:3](sbe1260.htm#fr_954) Viz. the \xc3\x82gnidhra lays them down between the altar\nand the pra _n_ ita _h_ (see p. 422, note 3); the firewood behind (west of)\nthe sacrificial grass (barhis), and both with the tops towards the south. The\nwooden sword also has been previously put down by the Adhvaryu close behind\nthe pra _n_ ita _h_.\n\n[424:1](sbe1260.htm#fr_955) The lady of the house not being present at the\nsacrifice to the Manes, neither the ceremony of girding (I, 3, 1, 12 seq.),\nnor that of her looking at the butter--while it is taken from the Garhapatya\nfire, along the east side of the \xc3\x82havaniya to the altar--takes place on this\noccasion. According to the commentators on Katy. V, 8, 25 (Paddh. p. 519),\nhowever, the Adhvaryu has to look down on the butter, with the same text (Va\n_g_. S. I, 30) which was used by the sacrificer\'s wife. For some details to be\nsupplied here, see I, 3, 1, 22-28.\n\n[424:2](sbe1260.htm#fr_956) He has hitherto worn his sacrificial cord on the\nright shoulder and under the left arm (\'eastward-invested\'), and now shifts it\nso as to be on the left shoulder and under the right arm (\'sacrificially-\ninvested\'). As to the taking or ladling of butter into the offering-spoons,\nsee I, 3, 2, 1 seq.\n\n[424:3](sbe1260.htm#fr_957) See I, 3, 2, 9.\n\n[424:4](sbe1260.htm#fr_958) See I, 3, 3, 1 seq.\n\n[424:5](sbe1260.htm#fr_959) The barhis, on this occasion, must have been cut\nclose to the root (upamulam, II, 4, 2, 17; upamule ditam, Ka _n_ va rec.).\nAccording to Taitt. Br. I, 6, 8, 6-7, on the other hand, it has apparently to\nbe torn up with the roots (yat parushi dina _m_ tad devanam, yad antara tan\nmanushya _n_ am, yat samula _m_ tat pit _r i_ _n_ am).\n\n[425:1](sbe1260.htm#fr_960) As he did on the former occasion, I, 3, 3, 5.\n\n[425:2](sbe1260.htm#fr_961) According to Taitt. Br. I, 6, 8, 7, because the\nfathers abide in the third world from here (t _ri_ tiye va ito loke pitara _h_\n).\n\n[425:3](sbe1260.htm#fr_962) Viz. he is to lay down the enclosing-sticks along\nthe north, west, and east sides, the last two with their tops towards the\nsouth. The third text (cf. I, 3, 4, 4) has, of course, to be changed to \'May\nMitra-Varu _n_ a lay thee around in the east,\' &c.; as has also the one he\nmutters after putting the two sticks on the fire, to \'May the sun guard thee\nfrom the south against any imprecation!\' (I, 3, 4, 8.) According to Taitt. Br.\nI, 6, 8, 8-9, on the other hand, he is to lay down only two enclosing-sticks\n(viz. the middle or western, and the northern one, cf. Saya _n_ a on Taitt. S.\nII, p. 72).\n\n[426:1](sbe1260.htm#fr_963) Here he remains standing, while the Sacrificer and\nBrahman sit down facing the east.\n\n[426:2](sbe1260.htm#fr_964) Instead of the ordinary eleven verses, the first\nand last of which are recited thrice; see I, 3, 5, 6. According to Taitt. Br.\nI, 6, 9, I, the Adhvaryu summons the Hot _ri_ with \'Recite to the fire, as it\nis being kindled for the gods (and) fathers!\' The bunch of firewood, with the\nexception of one stick, which is reserved for the after-offerings, is divided\ninto three parts, one of which is thrown on the fire at the same time when the\nsyllable \'om\' is pronounced by the Hot _ri_ at the end of the kindling-verse.\n\n[427:1](sbe1260.htm#fr_965) The Ka _n_ va MS. reads, \'Bring Agni hither, O\nAgni!\' Before this, \xc3\x82 _s_ val. II, 19, 7 inserts, \'Bring hither the gods (and)\nfathers for the sacrificer!\' See I, 4, 2, 16.\n\n[427:2](sbe1260.htm#fr_966) According to the Ka _n_ va text he adds here the\nsame formula as at ordinary ish _t_ is (I, 4, 2, 17), \'Bring (them) hither, O\n_G_ atavedas, and offer up a good offering!\' For the formulas \'Bring hither\nAgni for the Hot _ri_ ship! bring hither thine own greatness!\' \xc3\x82 _s_ val. II,\n19, 8 apparently substitutes \'Bring hither Agni Kavyavahana!\' cf. further on,\npar. 30.\n\n[427:3](sbe1260.htm#fr_967) \'The Adhvaryu, having offered the two libations of\nbutter, and called for the _S_ rausha _t_ ,\' Ka _n_ va recension.\n\n[427:4](sbe1260.htm#fr_968) On the pravara, or election of the (divine and\nhuman) Hot _ri_ ; see I, 4, 2, 1 seq., 5, I, 1 seq. The call \'Hot _ri_ , seat\nthyself!\' here takes the place of the formulas given I, 5, 1, 5 seq.\n\n[427:5](sbe1260.htm#fr_969) See I, 5, 3, 1 seq.\n\n[428:1](sbe1260.htm#fr_970) At the sacrifice to the Manes, the \xc3\x82gnidhra, when\nuttering his response, stands south of the Adhvaryu. See [p.\n132](sbe1222.htm#page_132), note. The first syllable of \'svadha\' is\nprotracted. According to the comm. on Katy. V, 9, 12, the offering formulas\nalso begin with \'Y\xe1\xba\xbd svadhamahe,\' instead of \'Y\xe1\xba\xbd ya _g_ amahe\' (see I, 5, 2, 16\nand note).\n\n[428:2](sbe1260.htm#fr_971) I do not quite see the pertinency of the reason\nhere alleged, unless it be that the author means to say that once (by the\nfirst p. 429 act) the fathers have departed, and by a second act they return\nhither. According to \xc3\x82 _s_ val. II, 19, 22, the two invitatory prayers to the\nPitara _h_ Somavanta _h_ are Rig-v. X, 15, 1; IX, 96, 11; to Soma Pit _ri_\nmat, Rig-v. I, 91, 1; 20; to the Pitaro Barhishada _h_ , Rig-v. X, 15, 4; 3;\nto the Pitaro \'gnishvatta _h_ , Rig-v. X, 15, 11; 13; [to Yama X, 14, 4;\n5.]--The offering-prayers being respectively, Rig-v. X, 15, 5; VIII, 48, 13;\nX, 15, 2; X, 15, 14; [X, 14, 1.]\n\nSomewhat different the Black Ya _g_ us; viz. Soma Pit _ri_ mat, anuvakyas\nRig-v.

X, 15, 12; ya\n_g_ ya X, 14, 3) [and another to Yama A\xe1\xb9\x85girasvat Pit _ri_ mat (anuv. X, 14, 4;\n5; ya _g_ ya X, 14, 6).] Taitt. S. I, 8, 5; II, 6, 12; Taitt. Br. I, 6, 9.\n\n[429:1](sbe1260.htm#fr_972) From the centre of each sacrificial dish he makes\none \'cutting\' with the _s_ _ri_ tavadana, shaped like a cow\'s ear. Katy. V, 9,\n2, and Schol.\n\n[429:2](sbe1260.htm#fr_973) Or rather the \'Svadha nama _h_ ,\' cf. par. 24. The\nAdhvaryu makes the oblation with his left hand, while looking towards the\nsouth. Paddh. on Katy. V, 9.\n\n[431:1](sbe1260.htm#fr_974) According to the comm. on Katy. V, 9, 13, \'mantha\n_h_ \' is, in that case, substituted for i _d_ a\' in the invocation, see I, 8,\n1, 19 seq. The Ka _n_ va MS. has as follows: Thereupon, by way of i _d_ a,\nthey place that same porridge into the hand of the Hot _ri_. The Hot _ri_ ,\nhaving invoked it, smells it. They hand it to the \xc3\x82gnidhra. The \xc3\x82gnidhra\nsmells it. They hand it to the Brahman. The Brahman smells it. As to this\n\xc3\x82suri said, \'As from any other oblation they cut off the "i _d_ a" and the\nfore-portion, so let them cut off and smell, p. 432 but not eat: some indeed\nmust be eaten of that of which offering is made in the fire.\'\n\n[432:1](sbe1260.htm#fr_975) See II, 4, 2, 16 seq. According to the comm. on\nKaty. V, q, 27, some sprinkle three times round the altar for each of the\nthree ancestors. But according to the Paddhati, he sprinkles once round the\naltar, beginning from the north-west corner; then he sits down and pours out\nwater in that corner for the father. Thereupon, after walking round in the\nopposite direction (from left to right) to the south-west corner, he again\nsprinkles all round, and in the same way pours out water in that corner for\nthe grandfather; and after retracing his steps as far as the south-east\ncorner, he performs the same circumambulation, and pours out water in that\ncorner for the great-grandfather; whereupon he again retraces his steps up to\nthe west of the altar.\n\n[432:2](sbe1260.htm#fr_976) In the case of a sacrificer whose father is still\nalive, these ceremonies are performed in honour of the father\'s father,\ngrandfather, and great-grandfather.\n\n[433:1](sbe1260.htm#fr_977) He mixes the three pieces (about as much as a\nthumb\'s joint each) cut from the sacrificial dishes, and forms them into three\npi _n_ _d_ as or round cakes.\n\n[434:1](sbe1260.htm#fr_978) \'--the friends have shaken off (their\nintoxication),\' Ludwig; \'--they showered down upon us delightful gifts,\'\nGrassmann; \'they shook their dear (bodies),\' Saya _n_ a; \'--have trembled\nthrough their precious (bodies),\' Wilson.\n\n[434:2](sbe1260.htm#fr_979) The Rig-veda has \'somena\' instead of \'stomena.\'\n\n[435:1](sbe1260.htm#fr_980) The Ka _n_ va text has, \'The reason why he moves\nthrice round, sprinkling from left to right, is that, after going after those\nthree ancestors of his, he thereby leaves them, and returns to this, his own,\nworld.\' See II, 6, I, 15.\n\n[435:2](sbe1260.htm#fr_981) On the nivi, or unwoven end of the waist-cloth\n(Hindi dhoti, Mahr. dhotar), which had to be passed under and tucked up\nbehind, at the beginning of the present ceremony, see [p.\n368](sbe1253.htm#page_368), note [2](sbe1253.htm#fn_819).
