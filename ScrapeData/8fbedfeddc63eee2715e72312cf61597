Documents are of three kinds:\n\n2\\. Attested by the king, or by (other) witnesses, or unattested.\n\n3\\. A document is (said to be) attested by the king when it has been executed\n(in a court of judicature), on the king ordering it, by a scribe, his\n\n[42. In the first case the agreement is made in the following form, 'I shall\npay so and so much to you, in the way agreed on.' In the second case the sum\nis not divided between the sureties, and each of them liable for the whole\ndebt therefore. (Nand.)\n\nVII. 4. Y. II, 84-88.--5-7. Y. II, 89.--6. M. VIII, 168.--12. Y.

It is (said to be) attested by, witnesses when, having been written\nanywhere, and by any one, it is signed by witnesses in their own hands.\n\n5\\. It is (said to be) unattested when it has been written (by the party\nhimself) with his own hand.\n\n6\\. Such a document, if it has been caused to be written by force, makes no\nevidence.\n\n7\\. Neither does any fraudulent document (make evidence);\n\n8\\. Nor a document (which), though attested, (is vitiated) by the signature of\na witness bribed (by one party) or of bad character;\n\n9\\. Nor one written by a scribe of the same description;\n\n10\\. Nor one executed by a woman, or a child, or a dependant person, or one\nintoxicated or insane, or one in danger or in bodily fear.\n\n11\\. (That instrument is termed) proof which is not adverse to peculiar local\nusages, which defines clearly the nature of the pledge given[1], and is free\nfrom confusion in the arrangement of the subject matter and (in the succession\nof) the syllables.\n\n12\\.

According to Nand., the particle _k_ a is used here in order to include\ndocuments that have been executed by a person intoxicated, by one under\nduress, by a female, by a child, by force, and by intimidation (see Narada IV,\n61). Most of these categories are, however, mentioned in Sutra 10.\n\n11\\. 1 I have translated the reading vyaktadhividhilaksha _n_ am, which,\nthough not occurring in the text of any MS., is mentioned by Nand., and is\nfound in an identical passage of the Institutes of Narada (see Narada IV, 60,\nand Appendix, p. 123).]\n\np. 48\n\nletters or signs (such as the flourish denoting the word _S_ ri and the like)\nor documents executed by the same man, by (enquiring into) the probabilities\nof the case, and by (finding out such writings as show) a mode of writing\nsimilar (to that contained in the disputed document).\n\n13\\. Should the debtor, or creditor, or witness, or scribe be dead, the\nauthenticity of the document has to be ascertained by (comparing with it\nother.) specimens of their handwriting.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII.](sbe07010.htm)\n\n"
