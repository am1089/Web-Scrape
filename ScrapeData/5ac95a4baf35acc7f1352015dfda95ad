[1900], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 46\n\n11:3:1\n\n### THIRD ADHY\xc3\x82YA. FIRST BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n#### THE AGNIHOTRA.\n\n11:3:1:11\\. Verily, the Agnihotri cow is the speech of the Agnihotra, and her\ncalf is its mind. Now these two, mind and speech, whilst being one and the\nsame, are, as it were, distinct from each other: therefore they tie up the\ncalf and its mother with one and the same rope; and the fire 1, indeed, is\nfaith, and the ghee truth.\n\n11:3:1:22\\. Now, as to this _G_ anaka of Videha once asked Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya,\n'Knowest thou the Agnihotra, Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya?'--'I know it, O king,' he\nsaid.--'What is it?'--'Milk, indeed.'\n\n11:3:1:33\\. 'If there were no milk, wherewith wouldst thou sacrifice?'--'With\nrice and barley.'--'If there were no rice and barley, wherewith wouldst thou\nsacrifice?'--'With what other herbs there are.'--'If there were no other\nherbs, wherewith wouldst thou sacrifice?'--'With what forest herbs there\nare.'--'If there were no forest herbs, wherewith wouldst thou\nsacrifice?'--'With fruit of trees.'--'If there were no fruit of trees,\nwherewith wouldst thou sacrifice?'--'With water.'--'If there were no water,\nwherewith wouldst thou sacrifice?'\n\n11:3:1:44\\. He spake, 'Then, indeed, there would be nothing whatsoever here,\nand yet there would be offered--the truth in faith.'--'Thou knowest the\nAgnihotra, Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya: I give thee a hundred cows,' said _G_ anaka.\n\n11:3:1:55\\. Concerning this point there are also these\n\np. 47\n\nverses:--'Knowing what 1, does the offerer of the Agnihotra stay away from his\nhouse? how is his wisdom (manifested) 2? how is he kept up by his fires 3?'--\nwhereby he means to say, 'How, then, is there no staying away from home on his\npart 4?'\n\n11:3:1:66\\. 'He who is the swiftest in the worlds 5, that wise one is found\nstaying abroad: thus (is manifested) his wisdom, thus he is kept up by his\nfires;'--he thereby means the mind: it is owing to his mind that there is no\nstaying away from home on his part.\n\n11:3:1:77\\. 'When, having gone far away, he heedeth not there his duty,\nwherein is that offering of his offered; (and wherein) do they, at his house,\nperform the offering of the progress?'--that is to say,--'When, having gone\nfar away, he there heeds not his duty, wherein does that offering of his come\nto be offered?'\n\n11:3:1:88\\. 'He who waketh in the worlds and sustaineth all beings, in him\nthat offering of his is offered, (and in him) do they, at his house, perform\nthe offering\n\np. 48\n\nof the progress;'--he thereby means the breath; whence they say, 'The\nAgnihotra is breath.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[46:1](sbe44018.htm#fr_177) That is, according to Saya _n_ a, the fire, or\nheat, produced by the rope. Instead of 'te _g_ a eva _s_ raddha,' one would\nrather expect ' _s_ raddhaiva te _g_ a _h_.'\n\n[47:1](sbe44018.htm#fr_178) That is, according to Saya _n_ a,--What form of\nAgnihotra does he recognise, when he goes to stay abroad?\n\n[47:2](sbe44018.htm#fr_179) That is,--How does he show his knowledge of the\nsacred obligation that one ought to perform the Agnihotra regularly twice a\nday for life?\n\n[47:3](sbe44018.htm#fr_180) That is to say, How is the continuity in the\nconstant attendance to his sacred fires kept up by him?\n\n[47:4](sbe44018.htm#fr_181) Literally, 'How is non-staying abroad (brought\nabout)?' that is to say,--How, though having to stay abroad, does he ensure\nthe spiritual benefits of remaining at home? or, as Saya _n_ a puts it, How is\nthe fault of staying abroad, avoided?--asya pravasato ya _g_ amanasya\nanapaproshitam pravasadoshabhava _h_.\n\n[47:5](sbe44018.htm#fr_182) Or, among (or in) beings. Saya _n_ a supplies 'ya\n_g_ amana _h_ ' to 'yo _g_ avish _th_ a _h_.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 3, 2. Second Brahma _n_ a](sbe44019.htm)\n\n"
