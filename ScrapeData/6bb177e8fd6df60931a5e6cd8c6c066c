In the case of (the text of) some (the Ka _n_ vas) where food is not\nmentioned, (the number five is made full) by the light (mentioned in the\npreceding mantra).\n\nThe Ka _n_ va-text, although not mentioning food, makes up the full number\nfive, by the light mentioned in the mantra preceding that in which the five-\npeople are spoken of. That mantra describes the nature of Brahman by saying,\n'Him the gods worship as the light of lights.'--If it be asked how it is\naccounted for that the light mentioned in both texts equally is in one text to\nbe employed for the explanation of the five-people, and not in the other text;\nwe reply that the reason lies in the difference of the requirements. As the\nMadhyandinas meet in one and the same mantra with breath and four other\nentities enabling them to interpret the term, 'the five-people,' they are in\nno need of the light mentioned in another mantra. The Ka _n_ vas, on the other\nhand, cannot do without the light. The case is analogous to that of the Sho\n_d_ a _s_ in-cup, which, according to different\n\np. 263\n\npassages, is either to be offered or not to be offered at the atiratra-\nsacrifice.\n\nWe have proved herewith that Scripture offers no basis for the doctrine of the\npradhana. That this doctrine cannot be proved either by Sm _ri_ ti or by\nratiocination will be shown later on.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4, 14](sbe34125.htm)\n\n"
