To the north of the fire he places vessels which are filled respectively,\nwith rice, barley, beans, and sesamum seeds;\n\n3\\. To the west (the boy) for whom the ceremony shall be performed, in his\nmother's lap, bull-dung in a new vessel, and _S_ ami leaves are placed.\n\n4 4. To the south of the mother the father (is seated) holding twenty-one\nbunches of Ku _s_ a grass.\n\n5\\. Or the Brahman should hold them.\n\n6\\. To the west of (the boy) for whom the ceremony is to be performed, (the\nfather) stations himself and pours cold and warm water together with (the\nwords), 'With warm water, O Vayu, come hither!'\n\n7\\. Taking of that (water), (and) fresh butter, or (some) drops of curds, he\nthree times moistens (the boy's) head, from the left to the right, with (the\nformula), 'May Aditi cut thy hair; may the waters moisten thee for vigour!'\n\n8 8. Into the right part (of the hair) he puts each\n\np. 185\n\ntime three Ku _s_ a bunches, with the points towards (the boy) himself, with\n(the words), 'Herb! protect him!'\n\n9\\. (With the words,) 'Axe! do no harm to him!' he presses a copper razor (on\nthe Ku _s_ a blades),\n\n10\\. And cuts (the hair) with (the verse), 'The razor with which in the\nbeginning Savit _ri_ the knowing one has shaved (the beard) of king Soma and\nof Varu _n_ a, with that, ye Brahma _n_ as, shave now his (hair), that he may\nbe blessed with long life, with old age.'\n\n11\\. Each time that he has cut, he gives (the hairs) with their points to the\neast, together with _S_ ami leaves, to the mother. She puts them down on the\nbull-dung.\n\n12\\. 'With what Dhat _ri_ has shaven (the head) of B _ri_ haspati, Agni and\nIndra, for the sake of long life, with that I shave thy (head) for the sake of\nlong life, of glory, and of welfare'\xc2\x97thus a second time.\n\n13 13. 'By what he may at night further see the sun, and see it long, with\nthat I shave thy (head) for the sake of long life, of glory, and of\nwelfare'\xc2\x97thus a third time.\n\n14\\. With all (the indicated) Mantras a fourth time.\n\n15\\. Thus three times on the left side (of the head).\n\n16 16. Let him wipe off the edge of the razor with (the words), 'If thou\nshavest, as a shaver, his hair with the razor, the wounding, the well-shaped,\npurify his head, but do not take away his life.'\n\np. 186\n\n17\\. Let him give orders to the barber, 'With lukewarm water doing what has to\nbe done with water, without doing harm to him, arrange (his hair) well.'\n\n18 18.
