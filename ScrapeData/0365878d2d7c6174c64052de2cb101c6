EMERSON.\n\np. ix\n\n### FOREWORD.\n\n![](img/iinit.jpg)IT is admitted, by common consent, that the works of Emerson\nstand at the head of American literature. The cause of their pre-eminence, it\nmight well be added, is the rebirth, in them, of the thoughts and ideals of\nthe most ancient Upanishads. Emerson himself was perfectly aware of this\naffinity; he found no fitter illustration of his understanding of immortality\nthan the teaching of Death, with which I have begun this volume. His words may\nwell be repeated:\n\n"Within every man\'s thought is a higher thought; within the character he\nexhibits to-day, a higher character. The youth puts off the illusions of the\nchild; the man puts off the ignorance and tumultuous passions of youth;\nproceeding thence, puts off the egotism of manhood, and becomes at last a\npublic and universal soul. He is rising to greater heights, but also rising to\nrealities; the other relations\n\np. x\n\nand circumstances dying out, he entering deeper into God, God into him, until\nthe last garment of egotism falls, and he is with God; shares the will and\nimmensity of the First Cause. It is curious to find the selfsame feeling, that\nit is not immortality but eternity, not duration but a state of abandonment to\nthe Highest, and so the sharing of His perfection, appearing in the farthest\neast and west. The human mind takes no account of geography, language, or\nlegends, but in all utters the same instinct. Yams, the lord of Death,\npromised Nachiketas, the son of Gautama, to grant him three boons at his own\nchoice"--and then follows the teaching, as I have given it\n\nThe central thought, and almost the very words of the second Upanishad here\ntranslated, concerning the worlds, and their putting forth by the Divine, are\nfaithfully imaged in another of Emerson\'s essays:\n\n"But when, following the invisible steps of thought, we come to enquire,\nwhence is matter? and whereto? many truths arise out of the recesses of\nconsciousness. We learn that the highest is present to the soul of man;\n\np. xi\n\nthat the dread universal essence, which is not wisdom, or love, or beauty, or\npower, but all in one, and each entirely, is that for which all things exist,\nand that by which they are; that spirit creates; that behind nature,\nthroughout nature, spirit is present As a plant upon the earth, so a man rests\nupon the bosom of God; he is nourished by unfailing fountains, and draws, at\nhis need, inexhaustible power."\n\nTo cite all the passages in which Emerson bears testimony to the truth\ncontained in the third passage I have rendered: that the soul of man is one\nwith the immemorial Soul that wove the worlds, would be, to repeat the greater\npart of what he has written; for this, more than anything else, is the heart\nof his message. One passage, out of many, will be enough:\n\n"The soul gives itself, alone original and pure, to the Lonely, Original and\nPure, who, on that condition, gladly inhabits, leads, and speaks through it.\nThen it is glad, young, and nimble. Behold, it saith, I am born into the\ngreat, the universal mind. I, the imperfect, adore my own perfect.\n\np. xii\n\n[paragraph continues] I am somehow recipient of the great soul, and thereby I\ndo overlook the sun and the stars, and feel them to be the fair accidents and\neffects which change and pass. More and more the surges of everlasting nature\nenter into me, and I become public and human in my regards and actions. So I\ncome .to live in thoughts, and act with energies, which are immortal."\n\nLet me add, to these three, one more passage, which shows the same primeval\npower, that gave birth to the imagery of ancient wisdom, once more actively\ncreative; a passage, more eloquent, perhaps, than all else that Emerson has\nwritten:\n\n"There is no chance, and no anarchy, in the universe. All is system and\ngradation. Every god is there, sitting in his sphere. The young mortal enters\nthe hall of the firmament; there, he is alone with them alone; they pouring on\nhim benedictions and gifts, and beckoning him up to their thrones. On the\ninstant, and incessantly, fall snow-storms of illusions. He fancies himself in\na vast crowd which sways this way and that, and whose movements and doings he\n\np. xiii\n\nmust obey; he fancies himself poor, orphaned, insignificant. The mad crowd\ndrives hither and thither, now furiously commanding this thing to be done, now\nthat. What is he that he should resist their will, and think or act for\nhimself? Every moment new changes and new showers of deceptions to baffle and\ndistract him. And when by and by, for an instant, the air clears, and the loud\nlifts a little, there are the gods still sitting around him on their thrones;\nthey alone, with him alone."\n\nC.
