That man (conceived as uktha) is the sea, rising beyond the whole world 1.\nWhatever he reaches, he wishes to go beyond 2. If he reaches the sky, he\nwishes to go beyond.\n\n2\\. If he should reach that (heavenly) world, he would wish to go beyond.\n\n3\\. That man is fivefold. The heat in him is fire; the apertures (of the\nsenses) are ether; blood, mucus, and seed are water; the body is earth; breath\nis air.\n\n4\\. That air is fivefold, viz. up-breathing, down-breathing, back-breathing,\nout-breathing, on-breathing. The other powers (devatas), viz. sight, hearing,\nmind, and speech, are comprised under up-breathing and down-breathing. For\nwhen breath departs, they also depart with it.\n\n5\\. That man (conceived as uktha) is the sacrifice, which is a succession now\nof speech and now of thought. That sacrifice is fivefold, viz. the Agnihotra,\nthe new and full moon sacrifices, the four-monthly sacrifices, the animal\nsacrifice, the Soma sacrifice. The Soma sacrifice is the most perfect of\nsacrifices, for in it these five kinds of ceremonies are seen: the first which\nprecedes the libations (the Diksha, &c.), then three libations, and what\nfollows (the Avabh _ri_ tha, &c.) is the fifth.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[223:1](sbe01216.htm#fr_556) Bhuloka.
