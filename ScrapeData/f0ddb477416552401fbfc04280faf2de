Now the gods at that time were desiring, 'May we be like Par _g_ anya\n(the rain-god)!' By that body (of his 1) they became like Par _g_ anya, and in\nlike manner does the Sacrificer by that body (of his) become like Par _g_\nanya.\n\n6:7:3:22\\. [Va _g_. S. XII, 6; _Ri_ k S. X, 45, 4] 'Agni roared like the\nthundering sky,'--for he (Agni) indeed roars like the thundering Par _g_\nanya;--'again and again licking the ground, stroking 2 the plants,'--for Par\n_g_ anya, whilst licking again and\n\np. 278\n\nagain the ground, does stroke the plants;--'scarce born, the kindled shone\nforth,'--for scarce born he indeed lights up everything here;--'with his light\nhe shineth between the two worlds,'--the two worlds, doubtless, are the heaven\nand the earth, and these two he indeed illumes by his light. He holds it (the\nfire in the pan) up so as to be beyond the reach of his arms, for Par _g_ anya\nis beyond the reach of (our) arms.\n\n6:7:3:33\\. He then lowers it; for whatever sap, whatever sustenance there is\nin this world, that rises upwards with it through these worlds, for Agni is\nthe sap, Agni is the substance in this world: thus were that always to be so\n1, then there would be no sap, no sustenance in this world; but when he lowers\n(the fire), he bestows sap and sustenance on this world.\n\n6:7:3:44\\. And, again, why he lowers it,--he then indeed rises upwards from\nhere through these worlds: that is, as it were, a rising away from here. But\nthis earth is the resting-place; and were that always to be so, the Sacrificer\nwould be removed from this world. But when he lowers (the fire), he thereby\ncomes back to this resting-place, and stands firmly on this resting-place.\n\n6:7:3:55\\. And, again, why he lowers it,--there, indeed, in rising upwards, he\nconquers these worlds from here: that is, as it were, a conquering in a\nforward direction. Now the conquest of him who conquers only in a forward\ndirection is completed by others; but for him who conquers both ways there is\nfree scope: thus, when he lowers (the fire) he conquers\n\np. 279\n\nthese worlds both from here upwards and from thence backwards.\n\n6:7:3:66\\. [Va _g_. S. XII, 7-10] 'Ever returning Agni, turn thou back unto\nme, with life, with vigour, with offspring, with riches; with gain, with\nwisdom, with wealth, with prosperity!--O Agni, A\xe1\xb9\x85giras! may thine be a hundred\ncourses, and a thousand returns: with increase of increase bring back what was\nlost by us, and bring us again riches!--Return again with sustenance, again, O\nAgni, with food and life, guard us again from trouble!--With wealth return, O\nAgni, overflow with the all-feeding stream on every side!'--that is, 'with all\nthis return thou to me!' Four times he lowers (the fire further and further),\nfor four times it rises upwards: thus as often as it rises upwards, so often\nhe lowers it; and having lowered it (completely), he holds it above his navel:\nthe significance of this has been explained 1.\n\n6:7:3:77\\. He then addresses him (Agni); for Agni is vital power: he thus lays\nvital power into his self: [Va _g_. S. XII, 11] 'Hither have I brought thee,'\n--for they do indeed bring him hither;--'thou hast entered,'--he then lays\nvital power into his self;--'stand thou firm, never staggering!'--he thus lays\nthe vital power firmly into his self;--'may all the people long for thee!'--\nthe people are food: thus, 'may all food long for thee!'--'may thy rule not\nfall away from thee!'--rule means glory: thus, 'may thy glory not fall away\nfrom thee!'\n\n6:7:3:88\\. He then unties the sling of the netting, and the sling of the gold\nplate; for the sling belongs to\n\np. 280\n\n[paragraph continues] Varu _n_ a: he thus frees himself from Varu _n_ a's\nnoose. He does so with a verse to Varu _n_ a: he thus frees himself from Varu\n_n_ a's noose by its own self, by its own deity. [Va _g_. S. XII, 12; _Ri_ k\nS. I, 24, 15] 'Take off from us, O Varu _n_ a, the uppermost cord, down (take)\nthe lowest, away the middle one!'--as the text, so the meaning;--'and so, O\n\xc3\x82ditya, may we be sinless in thy service for safety (Aditi)!'--Aditi is this\nearth: thus, 'Sinless may we belong to thee and to her (the earth)!'\n\n6:7:3:99\\. He then holds him (Agni) up thus (towards south-east); for on that\nformer occasion he raises him upwards from here towards the east with the\nfashioning formula 1; and he then holds him up thus (towards north-east 2).\nNow were that alone to take place, he (the sun), surely, would stop even there\n(in the north); but inasmuch as he now holds him up thus (towards south-east),\nhe (the sun) having gone thus (in a northerly direction), then comes back\nagain thus (in a southerly direction).\n\n6:7:3:1010\\. [Va _g_. S. XII, 13; _Ri_ k S. X, 1, 1] 'The great hath stood up\nerect before the Dawns,'--for before the dawn the great one (Agni) indeed\nstands up erect;--'emerged from the gloom he hath come with light,'--for\nemerged from the gloom, the night, he indeed comes with light, with the\nday;--'well-shapen with white light,'--for he, Agni, is indeed well-shapen\nwith white light;'--'when born, he hath filled all homesteads;'--all\nhomesteads, doubtless, means these worlds, and these he indeed fills, when\nborn. He holds him up so as to be beyond the reach of the arms, for he (the\n\np. 281\n\nsun) is beyond the reach of arms from here. He then lowers him: he thereby\ncomes back to this resting-place, and stands firmly on this resting-place. [He\ndoes so] with a _g_ agati verse 1, for the _G_ agati gains these worlds from\nabove hitherwards.\n\n6:7:3:1111\\. [Va _g_. S. XII, 14; _Ri_ k S. IV, 40, 5] 'The swan dwelling in\nthe light,'--the swan dwelling in the light, doubtless, is yonder sun;--'the\nVasu dwelling in the air,'--the Vasu dwelling in the air, doubtless, is the\nwind;--'the priest seated on the altar,'--the priest seated on the altar,\ndoubtless, is Agni;--'the guest,'--for he (Agni) is indeed the guest of all\nbeings;--'dwelling in the retreat 2,'--that is, 'dwelling in rugged\nplaces;'--'the man-dwelling,'--the man-dwelling, doubtless, is the vital air;\nand men are human beings: he thus means that vital air, that fire, which\n(burns) in human beings;--'the space-dwelling,'--for he (Agni) indeed is\nseated in all spaces;--'the law-seated,'--that is, 'the truth-seated;'--'the\nsphere-dwelling,'--for he is indeed seated in all spheres;--'the water-born,\ncow-born'--for he is indeed both water-born and cow-born;--'law-born,'--that\nis, 'truth-born;'--'rock-born,'--for he is born from the rock;--'the law,'--\nthat is, 'the truth.' With 'the Great!' he deposits it (the fire); for he\n(Agni) is indeed the great (truth): he thus deposits him (on the seat) after\nmaking him what he is.\n\n6:7:3:1212\\. [He does so] with two syllables ('b _ri_ hat'),--the Sacrificer\nis two-footed, and the Sacrificer is\n\np. 282\n\n[paragraph continues] Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure,\nwith so much he thus deposits him.\n\n6:7:3:1313\\. He then stands worshipping by him; for he makes, as it were,\nlight of him, when he strides with him through these worlds both thus\n(upwards), and thus (downwards): he now makes amends to him, so that he (Agni)\nmay not hurt him.\n\n6:7:3:1414\\. And, again, why he stands by him;--the gods at that time were\nafraid, lest he should injure these worlds of theirs from anigh: they thereby\nappeased him towards these worlds; and in like manner does he (the Sacrificer)\nnow appease him towards these worlds.\n\n6:7:3:1515\\. [Va _g_. S. XII, 15-17] 'Seat thee in this thy mother's lap,\nthou, O Agni, knowing all ordinances! burn her not with thy heat, thy flame!\nshine in her with a brilliant light!--Glowing with light and heat within thine\nown seat, be thou gracious unto this Ukha, O knower of beings!--Being gracious\nunto me, O Agni, now seat thee graciously! seat thee here in thine own seat,\nhaving made happy all the regions!'--by saying 'Gracious--Gracious,' he\nappeases him, so that he may not injure any one, and thus he, being appeased,\ndoes not injure these worlds.\n\n6:7:3:1616\\. With three (verses) he stands by worshipping;--three in number\nare these worlds, and threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is\nhis measure, with so much he thereby makes amends to him, and with so much\ndoes he thereby appease him towards these worlds.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[277:1](sbe4151.htm#fr_530) Viz. by the Agni who is now being held up, and of\nwhom Par _g_ anya is said to be another form, at [VI, 1, 3,\n15](sbe4130.htm#6:1:3:15).
