And the future Buddha, wanting to cure this\ntalkativeness of his, was constantly seeking for some means of doing so.\n\nAt that time there was living, in a pond in the Himalaya mountains, a\ntortoise. Two young hamsas, or wild ducks, who came to feed there, made\nfriends with him. And one day, when they had become very intimate with him,\nthey said to the tortoise:\n\n"Friend tortoise! the place where we live, at the Golden Cave on Mount\nBeautiful in the Himalaya country, is a delightful spot. Will you come there\nwith us?"\n\n"But how can I get there?"\n\n"We can take you, if you can only hold your tongue, and will say nothing to\nanybody."\n\n"Oh! that I can do. Take me with you."\n\n"That\'s right," said they. And making the tortoise bite hold of a stick, they\nthemselves took the two ends in their teeth, and flew up into the air.\n\nSeeing him thus carried by the hamsas, some villagers called out, "Two wild\nducks are carrying a tortoise along on a stick!" Whereupon the tortoise wanted\nto say, "If my friends choose to carry me, what is that to you, you wretched\nslaves!" So just as the swift flight of the wild ducks had brought him over\nthe king\'s palace in the city of Benares, he let go of the stick he was\nbiting, and falling in the open courtyard, split in two! And there arose a\nuniversal cry, "A tortoise has fallen in the open courtyard, and has split in\ntwo!"\n\nThe king, taking the future Buddha, went to the place, surrounded by his\ncourtiers; and looking at the tortoise, he asked the Bodisat, "Teacher! how\ncomes he to be fallen here?"\n\nThe future Buddha thought to himself, "Long expecting, wishing to admonish the\nking, have I sought for some means of doing so. This tortoise must have made\nfriends with the wild ducks; and they must have made him bite hold of the\nstick, and have flown up into the air to take him to the hills. But he, being\nunable to hold his tongue. when he hears any one else talk, must have wanted\nto say __ something; and let go the stick; and so must have fallen down from\nthe sky, and thus lost his life." And saying, "Truly, O king! those who are\ncalled chatter-boxes--people whose words have no end--come to grief like\nthis," he uttered these Verses:\n\n"Verily the tortoise killed himself  \nWhilst uttering his voice;  \nThough he was holding tight the stick,  \nBy a word himself he slew.\n\n"Behold him then,  \nO excellent by strength!  \nAnd speak wise words, not out of season.  \nYou see how, by his talking overmuch,  \nThe tortoise fell into this wretched plight!"\n\nThe king saw that he was himself referred to, and said "O Teacher! are you\nspeaking of us?"\n\nAnd the Bodisat spake openly, and said, "O great king! be it thou, or be it\nany other, whoever talks beyond measure meets with some mishap like this."\n\nAnd the king henceforth refrained himself, and became a man of few words.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: A Lac of Rupees for a Piece of Advice](ift15.htm)\n\n'
