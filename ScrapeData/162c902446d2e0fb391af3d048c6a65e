And on account of the declaration of difference (the highest Self is)\nother (than the individual souls of the sun, &c.).\n\nThere are texts which clearly state that the highest\n\np. 242\n\n[paragraph continues] Self is different from \xc3\x82ditya and the other individual\nsouls: 'He who, dwelling within Aditya (the sun), is different from \xc3\x82ditya,\nwhom \xc3\x82ditya does not know, of whom \xc3\x82ditya is the body, who rules \xc3\x82ditya from\nwithin; who dwelling within the Self is different from the Self,' &c. (B _ri_.\nUp. III, 7, 9 ff.); 'Of whom the Imperishable is the body, whom the\nImperishable does not know; who moves within Death, of whom Death is the body,\nwhom Death does not know; he is the inner self of all beings, free from evil,\ndivine, the one God Naraya _n_ a' (Sub. Up.VII). These texts declare all\nindividual souls to be the body of the sinless highest Self which is said to\nbe the inward principle of all of them.--It is thereby completely proved that\nthe highest Self is something different from all individual souls such as\n\xc3\x82ditya, and so on.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of the 'one within.'\n\nThe text, 'That from which these beings are born,' teaches that Brahman is the\ncause of the world; to the question thence arising of what nature that cause\nof the world is, certain other texts give a reply in general terms (' Being\nonly this was in the beginning'; 'It sent forth fire'; 'The Self only this was\nin the beginning,' &c.); and thereupon it is shown on the basis of the special\nnature of that cause as proved by the attributes of 'thought' and 'bliss,'\nthat Brahman is different from the pradhana and the individual souls. The\nremaining part of this Pada now is devoted to the task of proving that where\nsuch special terms as Ether and the like are used in sections setting forth\nthe creation and government of the world, they designate not the thing-\nsentient or non-sentient--which is known from ordinary experience, but Brahman\nas proved so far.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 23.
