But, of knowledge and work--as these are the leading topics.\n\nThe \'but\' sets aside the view developed so far. It cannot be admitted that\nthose also who do not perform sacrifices, and so on, reach the moon; because\nthe path of the gods and the path of the fathers are meant for the enjoyment\nof the fruits \'of knowledge and work.\'That is to say--as those who do not\nperform sacrifices cannot ascend by the path of the gods, since they are\ndestitute of knowledge; so they also cannot go by the path of the fathers,\nsince they are destitute of meritorious works. And that these two paths are\ndependent respectively on knowledge and works, we know from the fact that\nthese two are the leading topics. For knowledge forms the leading topic with\nregard to the path of the gods,\'Those who know this, and those who in the\nforest follow faith and austerities, go to light,\' &c.; and works have the\nsame position with regard to the path of the fathers,"they who living in a\nvillage perform sacrifices, &c. go to the smoke," &c. The text, \'all those who\ndepart from this world go to the moon,\' must therefore be interpreted to mean\n\'all those who perform sacrifices go to the moon.\'--But if evil-doers do not\ngo to the moon, the fifth oblation cannot take place, and no new body can be\nproduced. For the text says, \'In the fifth oblation water is called man,\' and,\nas we have shown, that fifth oblation presupposes the soul\'s going to the\nmoon. In order, therefore, to understand how in their case also a new\nembodiment is possible, it must needs be admitted that they also ascend to the\nmoon.--To this the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 18.
