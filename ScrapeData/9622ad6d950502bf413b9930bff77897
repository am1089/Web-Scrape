The two  \nWho lingered on the spot, he slew.  \nI fled from mortal danger, freed  \nFrom the dire shaft by timely speed.  \nNow to deep thought my days I give,  \nAnd as a humble hermit live.  \nIn every shrub, in every tree  \nI view that noblest devotee.  \nIn every knotted trunk I mark  \nHis deerskin and his coat of bark,  \nAnd see the bow-armed Rama stand  \nLike Yama with his noose in hand.  \nI tell thee Ravan, in my fright  \nA thousand Ramas mock my sight,  \nThis wood with every bush and bough  \nSeems all one fearful Rama now.  \nThroughout the grove there is no spot  \nSo lonely where I see him not.  \nHe haunts me in my dreams by night,  \nAnd wakes me with the wild affright.  \nThe letter that begins his name  \nSends terror through my startled frame.  \nThe rapid cars whereon we ride,  \nThe rich rare jewels, once my pride,  \nHave names  1 that strike upon mine ear  \nWith hated sound that counsels fear.  \nHis mighty strength too well I know,  \nNor art thou match for such a foe.  \nToo strong were Raghus's son in fight  \nFor Namu*chi or Bali's might.  \nThen Rama to the battle dare,  \nOr else be patient and forbear;  \nBut, wouldst thou see me live in peace,  \nLet mention of the hero cease.  \nThe good whose holy lives were spent  \nIn deepest thought, most innocent.  \nWith all their people many a time  \nHave perished through another's crime.  \nSo in the common ruin, I  \nMust for another's folly die,  \nDo all thy strength and courage can.  \nBut ne'er will I approve the plan.  \nFor he, in might supremely great,  \n\nThe giant world could extirpate,  \nSince, when impetuous Khara sought  \nThe grove of Janasthan and fought  \nFor Surpanakha's sake, he died  \nBy Rama's hand in battle tried.  \nHow has he wronged thee? Soothly swear,  \nAnd Rama's fault and sin declare.  \n   I warn thee, and my words are wise,  \n     I seek thy people's weal:  \n   But if this rede thou wilt despise.  \n     Nor hear my last appeal,  \n   Thou with thy kin and all thy friends  \n     In fight this day wilt die,  \n   When his great bow the hero bends,  \n     And shafts unerring fly.'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[275:1](ry237.htm#fr_494) The Sanskrit words for car and jewels begin with\n_ra_.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XL.: Ravan's Speech.](ry238.htm)\n\n"
