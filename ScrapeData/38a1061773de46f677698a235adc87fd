Does a learned\nman reach taciturnity 7 by taciturnity? And how, O sage! do they practise\ntaciturnity in this world\n\np. 163\n\nSanatsu _g_ ata said:\n\nSince the Vedas, together with the mind 1, fail to attain to him, hence (is\nhe) taciturnity 2\\--he about whom the words of the Vedas were uttered 3, and\nwho, O king! shines forth as consubstantial 4 with them.\n\nDh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra said:\n\nDoes 5 the twice-born person who studies the _Rik_ and the Ya _g_ us texts,\nand the Sama-veda, committing sinful (acts), become tainted, or does he not\nbecome tainted?\n\nSanatsu _g_ ata said\n\nNot the Saman texts, nor yet the _Rik_ Texts, nor the Ya _g_ us texts 6 save\nhim, O acute sir! from sinful\n\np. 164\n\naction. I do not tell you an untruth. The _Kh_ andas do not save a sinful\ndeceitful 1 man who behaves deceitfully 2. At the time of the termination (of\nhis life), the _Kh_ andas abandon 3 him, as birds who have got wings (abandon\ntheir) nest.\n\nDh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra said\n\nIf, O acute sir! the Vedas are not able to save one who understands the Vedas,\nthen whence is this eternal talk 4 of the Brahma _n_ as?\n\nSanatsu _g_ ata said:\n\nO you of great glory! this universe becomes manifest through his special forms\n--names 5 and the rest. The Vedas proclaim (his form) after describing (it)\nwell 6, and (they 7 also) state his difference from the universe. For that 8\nare this penance and sacrifice prescribed. By these a learned man acquires\nmerit, and afterwards destroying sin by merit 9, he has his self illuminated\nby knowledge. By knowledge the learned man attains\n\np. 165\n\nthe self 1. But, on the other hand, one who wishes for the fruit--heaven\n2\\--takes with him 3 all that he has done in this (world), enjoys it in the\nnext, and then returns to the path 4 (of this world). Penance is performed in\nthis world; the fruit is enjoyed elsewhere. But the penance of Brahma _n_ as\nis further developed 5; that of others remains only as much (as when first\nperformed).\n\nDh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra said:\n\nHow does the pure penance become developed and well developed 6? O Sanatsu _g_\nata! tell (me.) how I should understand that, O Lord!\n\nSanatsu _g_ ata said:\n\nThis penance, free from sin 7, is called pure 8; and this pure penance becomes\ndeveloped and well developed, not otherwise 9. All this 10, O Kshatriya!\n\np. 166\n\nhas for its root that penance about which you question me. By penance 1, those\nconversant with the Vedas attained immortality, after departing from this\nworld.\n\nDh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra said.\n\n1 have heard about penance free from sin, O Sanatsu _g_ ata! Tell me what is\nthe sin (connected) with penance, so that I may understand the eternal mystery\n2.\n\nSanatsu _g_ ata said:\n\nThe twelve beginning with wrath, and likewise the seven cruelties, are the\ndefects (connected) with it; and there are (stated) in the Sastras twelve\nmerits (connected) with it, beginning with knowledge, which are known to the\ntwice-born, and may be developed. Wrath, desire 3, avarice, delusion 4,\ncraving 5, mercilessness, censoriousness, vanity, grief 6, attachment 7, envy\n8, reviling others--these twelve should always be avoided by a man of high\n\np. 167\n\nqualifications 1. These, O king of kings! attend each and every man, wishing\nto find some opening 2, as a hunter (watches) animals. [Boastful, lustful,\nhaughty, irascible, unsteady 3, one who does not protect (those dependent 4 on\nhim), these six sinful acts are performed by sinful men who are not afraid\n(even) in the midst of great danger 5.] One whose thoughts are (all) about\nenjoyments, who prospers by injuring (others), who repents of generosity, who\nis miserly, who is devoid of the power 6 (of knowledge), who esteems the group\n7 (of the senses), who hates his wife 8\\--these seven, different (from those\npreviously mentioned), are the seven forms of cruelty. Knowledge, truth, self-\nrestraint, sacred learning, freedom from animosity (towards living beings),\nmodesty 9, endurance 10, freedom from censoriousness, sacrifice, gift,\ncourage} 11, quiescence 12,these are the twelve great observances 13 of a\nBrahma _n_ a. Whoever is not devoid of these twelve can govern this whole\nworld, and those who are\n\np. 168\n\npossessed of three, two, or even one (of these) become, in (due) course,\ndistinguished (for knowledge) and identified with the Brahman 1. [Self-\nrestraint, abandonment 2, and freedom from heedlessness--on these depends\nimmortality. And the talented Brahma _n_ as say that truth is chief over\nthem.] Self-restraint has eighteen defects; if (any one of them is) committed,\nit is an obstacle (to self-restraint), They are thus stated. 'Untruthfulness,\nbackbiting, thirst 3, antipathy (to all beings), darkness 4, repining 5,\nhatred 6 of people, haughtiness, quarrelsomeness, injuring living creatures,\nreviling others, garrulity, vexation 7, want of endurance 8, want of courage\n9, imperfection 10, sinful conduct, and slaughter. That is called self-\nrestraint by the good, which is free from these defects. Frenzy has eighteen\ndefects 11; and abandonment is of six kinds. The contraries of those which\nhave been laid down 12 are stated to be the defects of frenzy. Abandonment of\nsix kinds is excellent. Of those six, the third is hard to achieve. With it\none certainly crosses\n\np. 169\n\nbeyond all misery without distinction 1. That being achieved, (everything) is\naccomplished 2. The (first is the) giving away of sons and wealth to a\ndeserving man who asks (for them); the second is gifts at Vedic ceremonies,\nand gifts at ceremonies laid down in the Sm _ri_ tis 3. The abandonment of\ndesires, O king of kings! by means of indifference (to worldly objects) is\nlaid down as the third 4. With these one should become free from heedlessness.\nThat freedom from heedlessness, too, has eight characteristics, and is (a)\ngreat (merit). Truthfulness, concentration, absorbed contemplation, reflexion\n5, and also indifference (to worldly objects), not stealing 6, living the life\nof a Brahma _k_ arin, and\n\np. 170\n\nlikewise freedom from all belongings 1. Thus have the defects of self-\nrestraint been stated; one should avoid those defects. Freedom from (those)\ndefects is freedom from heedlessness; and that, too, is deemed to have eight\ncharacteristics 2. Let truth be your (very) self, O king of kings! On truth\nall the worlds rest 3. Truth is said to be their main (principle).\nImmortality, depends on truth 4. Getting rid of (these) defects, one should\npractise the observance of penance. This is the conduct prescribed by the\nCreator. Truth is the solemn vow of the good. The pure penance, which is free\nfrom these defects, and possessed of these characteristics, becomes developed,\nand well developed 5. I will state to you, in brief, O king of kings! what you\nask of me. This (observance) 6 is destructive of sin, and pure, and releases\n(one) from birth and death and old age 7. If one is free from the five senses,\nand also from the mind 8, O descendant of Bharata! also from (thoughts\nregarding) the past and the future 9, one becomes happy.\n\nDh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra said:\n\nSome people make great boasts in consequence of (their knowing) the Vedas with\nthe \xc3\x82khyanas as\n\np. 171\n\nthe fifth 1; others, likewise, are (masters) of four Vedas; others, too, of\nthree Vedas; others are (masters) of two Vedas, and of one Veda; and others of\nno Veda 2. Tell me which of these is the greatest, whom I may know (to be) a\nBrahma _n_ a.\n\nSanatsu _g_ ata said:\n\nThrough ignorance of the one Veda 3\\--the one truth--O king of kings! numerous\nVedas came into existence. Some 4 only adhere to the truth. The fancies of\nthose who have fallen away from the truth are abortive, and through ignorance\nof the truth, ceremonies become amplified 5. One should under stand a Brahma\n_n_ a, who (merely) reads much, to be a man of many words 6. Know him only to\nbe the (true) Brahma _n_ a, who swerves not from the truth 7. O you who are\nthe highest among men 8! the _Kh_ andas, indeed, refer of themselves 9 to it.\nTherefore,\n\np. 172\n\nstudying them, the learned persons who understand the _Kh_ andas, attain to\nthe Veda, not that which is to be known 1. Among the Vedas, there is none\nwhich understands 2. By the unintelligent 3, one understands not the Veda, nor\nthe object of knowledge 4. He who knows the Veda knows the object of\nknowledge. He who knows the object of knowledge 5 knows not the truth. He who\nunderstands the Vedas understands also the object of knowledge; but that 6 is\nnot understood by the Vedas or by those who understand the Vedas. Still the\nBrahma _n_ as who understand the Vedas, understand the Veda by means of the\nVedas 7. As the branch of a tree with regard to the part of a portion of the\nglorious 8 one, so, they declare, are the Vedas with\n\np. 173\n\nregard to the subject of understanding the supreme self. I understand him to\nbe a Brahma _n_ a who is ingenious, and explains 1 (Vedic texts). He who\napprehends (those texts) thus 2, does verily know that supreme (principle). .\nOne should not go in search of it among (things) antagonistic 3 to it at all.\nNot looking (for him there) one sees that Lord by means of the Veda 4.\nRemaining quiet, one should practise devotion, and should not even form a wish\nin the mind 5. To him, the Brahman presents 6 itself, and directly afterwards\nhe attains to the perfect 7 (one). By taciturnity 8, verily, does one become a\nsage; (one does) not (become) a sage by dwelling in a forest 9. And he is\ncalled the highest sage, who understands that indestructible (principle). One\nis called an analyser 10 (also) in consequence of\n\np. 174\n\nanalysing all objects. The analysis (is) from that as the root; and as he\nmakes (such an) analysis, hence is he so (called). The man who sees the worlds\ndirectly sees everything [1](sbe0825.htm#fn_812). A Brahma _n_ a, verily,\nadhering to the truth, understands it, and becomes omniscient. I say to you, O\nlearned person! that adhering to knowledge and the rest\n[2](sbe0825.htm#fn_813) in this way, one sees the Brahman, O Kshatriya! by\nmeans of a course (of study) in the Vedas [3](sbe0825.htm#fn_814).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[162:1](sbe0823.htm#fr_710) I. e. they both follow on devotion to worldly\nlife.\n\n[162:2](sbe0823.htm#fr_711) I. e. in the way to final emancipation.\n\n[162:3](sbe0823.htm#fr_712) The enjoyment of supreme felicity, Brahmananda (\n_S_ a _n_ kara); the greatness consisting of a knowledge of _Rik_ , Ya _g_ us,\n_S_ aman, and the substance of their teaching, which is worthy of a Brahma _n_\na (Nilakan _th_ a). See, too, Anugita, [p. 232](sbe0828.htm#page_232).\n\n[162:4](sbe0823.htm#fr_713) Modesty = being ashamed of doing wrong; restraint\n(of senses) =mental restraint; and purity is both internal and external,-- _S_\na _n_ kara; knowledge is, of course, knowledge of the Brahman.\n\n[162:5](sbe0824.htm#fr_714) I. e. that spoken of in the last chapter.\n\n[162:6](sbe0824.htm#fr_715) Viz. mere silence, or the contemplation of the\nself after restraining all the senses. In the B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka-\nupanishad, _S_ a _n_ kara (p. 605) renders the original word, mauna, to mean,\n'The fruit of the destruction of the consciousness of anything other than the\nself.' And his commentator makes it clearer thus: 'The conviction in the mind\nthat one is the self--the supreme Brahman--and that there is nothing close\nexisting but oneself.'\n\n[162:7](sbe0824.htm#fr_716) I. e. the highest seat--the Brahman; for mind,\nsense, &c. are all non-existent there. Cf. Ka _th_ a, p. 151, and Maitri, p.\n161\n\n[163:1](sbe0824.htm#fr_717) Cf. Kenopanishad, p. 39; Ka _th_ a, p. 152;\nTaittiriya, p. 119.\n\n[163:2](sbe0824.htm#fr_718) 'Taciturnity is his name,' says Nilaka _nth_ a.\n\n[163:3](sbe0824.htm#fr_719) Or, says _S_ a _n_ kara, 'who is the author of the\nVedas.'\n\n[163:4](sbe0824.htm#fr_720) I. e. 'with the Vedas,' says Nilaka _nth_ a, Om,\nthe quintessence of the Vedas, being a name of the Brahman (as to which cf.\nGita, [p. 79](sbe0810.htm#page_79), and Maitri, p. 84). _S_ a _n_ kara takes\nthe whole expression to mean _g_ yotirmaya, consisting of light. Nilaka _nth_\na says this stanza answers the five following questions put in the stanza\npreceding, viz. of what use is taciturnity? which of the two is taciturnity?\n&c., as above. The first four questions are answered by the first two lines of\nthis stanza--the substance of the answer being, that the use of taciturnity is\nto attain the seat which is not to be grasped even by the mind, that\ntaciturnity includes both restraint of mind and of the external senses. By\nmeans of such restraint, the external and internal worlds cease to be\nperceived as existing, and the highest goal is attained.\n\n[163:5](sbe0824.htm#fr_721) This question arises naturally enough on Nilaka\n_nth_ a's interpretation of the preceding stanza, the meaning of which is in\nsubstance that the Vedas cannot grasp the Brahman fully, but they are of use\ntowards a rudimentary comprehension of it, as is said further on, see p. 172\ninfra.\n\n[163:6](sbe0824.htm#fr_722) Cf. _S_ veta _s_ vatara-upanishad, p. 339; see,\ntoo, N _ri_ si _m_ ha Tapini, pp. 81-98.\n\n[164:1](sbe0824.htm#fr_723) I. e. one who parades his piety.\n\n[164:2](sbe0824.htm#fr_724) I. e. hypocritically.\n\n[164:3](sbe0824.htm#fr_725) I. e. do not rise to his memory--Nilaka _nth_ a,\nciting Gita, [p. 78](sbe0810.htm#page_78) supra.\n\n[164:4](sbe0824.htm#fr_726) Scil. about the veneration due to one who has\nstudied the Vedas--Nilaka _nth_ a, citing one or two passages in point.\n\n[164:5](sbe0824.htm#fr_727) The universe consists of 'names and forms,' the\nreality being the Brahman only. Cf. _Kh_ andogya, p. 407 seq.\n\n[164:6](sbe0824.htm#fr_728) _S_ a _n_ kara refers to Taittiriya-upanishad, p.\n68; _Kh_ andogya, p. 596 seq. &c.\n\n[164:7](sbe0824.htm#fr_729) _S_ a _n_ kara takes this to mean 'sages,' who,\naccording to him, state the difference. He quotes Para _s_ ara for this.\n\n[164:8](sbe0824.htm#fr_730) I.e. the Brahman, that is to say, for attaining to\nit. Penance = _k_ andraya _n_ a and other observances; sacrifice = _g_ yotish\n_t_ oma, &c.\n\n[164:9](sbe0824.htm#fr_731) Cf. [p. 158](sbe0823.htm#page_158) supra, and\nTaittiriya-ara _ny_ aka, p. 888.\n\n[165:1](sbe0824.htm#fr_732) Cf. _S_ veta _s_ vatara, p. 327; Mu _nd_ aka, p.\n323.\n\n[165:2](sbe0824.htm#fr_733) So _S_ a _n_ kara. Nilaka _nth_ a takes the\noriginal word to mean 'the group of the senses,' and the whole phrase to mean\n'enjoyments of sense.' Nilaka _nth_ a is supported by a passage further on, p.\n167. But as to 'those who wish for heaven,' cf. Gita, pp.\n[48](sbe0804.htm#page_48)-[84](sbe0811.htm#page_84).\n\n[165:3](sbe0824.htm#fr_734) I. e. in the form of merit, &c.\n\n[165:4](sbe0824.htm#fr_735) Cf. Gita, [p. 84](sbe0811.htm#page_84).\n\n[165:5](sbe0824.htm#fr_736) Cf. _Kh_ andogya, p. 23. Brahma _n_ as = those\nthat know the Brahman. See p. 171 infra.\n\n[165:6](sbe0824.htm#fr_737) I am not quite sure about the meaning of the\noriginal here. _Ri_ dha, which I have rendered 'developed,' Nilaka _nth_ a\nunderstands to mean 'what is performed merely for show.' What has been\nrendered 'well developed' in the text, Nilaka _nth_ a takes to mean performed\nfrom some desire,' &c.\n\n[165:7](sbe0824.htm#fr_738) Anger, desire, &c.\n\n[165:8](sbe0824.htm#fr_739) The original is kevala. Nilaka _nth_ a says it is\nso called as being a means of kaivalya, 'final emancipation.'\n\n[165:9](sbe0824.htm#fr_740) I. e. not that which is not free from sin, which\nlatter is not developed at all.\n\n[165:10](sbe0824.htm#fr_741) All objects of enjoyment, Nilaka _nth_ a.\n\n[166:1](sbe0824.htm#fr_742) Cf. B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p. 899. Tapas is\nvariously rendered. See inter alia, Pra _s_ na, pp. 162-70; _S_ veta _s_\nvatara, p. 307; Mu _nd_ aka, pp. 270-280, 311-314; _Kh_ andogya, p. 136;\nAnugita, pp. [247](sbe0831.htm#page_247), [339](sbe0854.htm#page_339).\n\n[166:2](sbe0824.htm#fr_743) I. e. Brahma-vidya, or science of the Brahman,\nNilaka _nth_ a; the Brahman itself, _S_ a _n_ kara.\n\n[166:3](sbe0824.htm#fr_744) I. e. lust.\n\n[166:4](sbe0824.htm#fr_745) Want of discrimination between right and wrong.\n\n[166:5](sbe0824.htm#fr_746) Desire to taste worldly objects.\n\n[166:6](sbe0824.htm#fr_747) For the loss of anything desired.\n\n[166:7](sbe0824.htm#fr_748) Desire to enjoy worldly objects. The difference\nbetween this and craving, according to _S_ a _n_ kara, appears to be between\nmerely tasting and continual enjoyment. According to Nilaka _nth_ a, the\nformer is a desire which is never contented; the latter is merely a general\nliking.\n\n[166:8](sbe0824.htm#fr_749) Impatience of other people's prosperity;\ncensoriousness being the pointing out of flaws in other people's merits; and\nreviling being an ignoring of the merits and merely abusing.\n\n[167:1](sbe0824.htm#fr_750) Scil. for attaining to the Brahman.\n\n[167:2](sbe0824.htm#fr_751) Some weak point by which they may attack a man.\n\n[167:3](sbe0824.htm#fr_752) Fickle in friendship, &c.\n\n[167:4](sbe0824.htm#fr_753) Such as a wife, &c.\n\n[167:5](sbe0824.htm#fr_754) Connected with this or the next world, Nilaka\n_nth_ a. This and a stanza further on I place within brackets, as it is not\nquite certain whether _S_ a _n_ kara's copy had them, though they are now in\nsome of our copies of the text with his commentary. See Introduction.\n\n[167:6](sbe0824.htm#fr_755) Cf. Mu _nd_ aka, p. 319; _Kh_ andogya, p. 494.\n\n[167:7](sbe0824.htm#fr_756) See note , at page 165.\n\n[167:8](sbe0824.htm#fr_757) The wife having no other protector.\n\n[167:9](sbe0824.htm#fr_758) See note , at page [162](sbe0823.htm#page_162).\n\n[167:10](sbe0824.htm#fr_759) Of pairs of opposites, such as heat and cold, &c.\n\n[167:11](sbe0824.htm#fr_760) Restraint of senses in presence of their objects.\n\n[167:12](sbe0824.htm#fr_761) Cf. Gita, pp. [69](sbe0808.htm#page_69),\n[70](sbe0808.htm#page_70).\n\n[167:13](sbe0824.htm#fr_762) Which are serviceable in attaining the highest\ngoal.\n\n[168:1](sbe0824.htm#fr_763) The original is the word 'taciturnity' as at [p.\n162](sbe0823.htm#page_162) supra.\n\n[168:2](sbe0824.htm#fr_764) Offering one's acts to God (Nilaka _nth_ a), as to\nwhich cf. Gita, [p. 64](sbe0807.htm#page_64). See also [p.\n182](sbe0825.htm#page_182) infra for this stanza.\n\n[168:3](sbe0824.htm#fr_765) I. e. for objects of sense.\n\n[168:4](sbe0824.htm#fr_766) Ignorance.\n\n[168:5](sbe0824.htm#fr_767) Discontent even when one obtains much.\n\n[168:6](sbe0824.htm#fr_768) This is active; antipathy is passive only.\n\n[168:7](sbe0824.htm#fr_769) Of oneself, by brooding on evil. Cf. Taittiriya,\np. 119. One copy of _S_ a _n_ kara's commentary says this means 'thinking ill\nof others without cause.'\n\n[168:8](sbe0824.htm#fr_770) Of pairs of opposites.\n\n[168:9](sbe0824.htm#fr_771) Restraint of senses in presence of their objects.\n\n[168:10](sbe0824.htm#fr_772) I. e. of piety, knowledge, and indifference to\nworldly objects.\n\n[168:11](sbe0824.htm#fr_773) I. e. qualities which destroy it.\n\n[168:12](sbe0824.htm#fr_774) Scil. as defects of self-restraint, viz.\nuntruthfulness, &c.\n\n[169:1](sbe0824.htm#fr_775) Scil. any distinction as to physical, mental, or\nthat which is caused by superhuman agency.\n\n[169:2](sbe0824.htm#fr_776) Literally, 'all is conquered.' Everything that\nneeds to be done is done. Cf. Ka _th_ opanishad, p. 155; Mu _nd_ aka, p. 317.\n\n[169:3](sbe0824.htm#fr_777) Another interpretation of ish _t_ apurta is\n'offerings to gods, and 'offerings to the manes;' a third 'sacrifices, &c.,\nand works of charity, such as digging tanks and wells;' for a fourth, see _S_\na _n_ kara on Mu _nd_ aka, p. 291.\n\n[169:4](sbe0824.htm#fr_778) Each of the three classes mentioned contains two\nsub-classes, and so the six are made up. It is not quite easy to see the two\nheads under the third class; but perhaps indifference, and the consequent\nabandonment of desire, may be the two intended. To indicate that, I have\nadopted the construction which takes the words 'by means of indifference' with\nabandonment, instead of with 'gifts at Vedic ceremonies,' &c. _S_ a _n_ kara\nseems to understand 'giving away of wealth' with the words 'by means of\nindifference,' and thus to constitute the second head under the third class.\nBut he is not quite clear.\n\n[169:5](sbe0824.htm#fr_779) Concentration = fixing the mind continuously on\nsome object, such as the being in the sun, &c.; contemplation is that in which\none identifies oneself with the Brahman; reflexion as to what one is, whence\none comes, and so forth.\n\n[169:6](sbe0824.htm#fr_780) _S_ a _n_ kara says this may refer to the\n'stealing' mentioned at [p. 160](sbe0823.htm#page_160). The life of a Brahma\n_k_ arin is here taken to mean p. 170 continence by the commentators, as also\nat Mu _nd_ aka, p. 311 inter alia. See also _Kh_ andogya, p. 533.\n\n[170:1](sbe0824.htm#fr_781) Son, wife, home, &c.; as to which cf. Gita, [p.\n103](sbe0815.htm#page_103), and N _ri_ si _m_ ha Tapini, p. 198, commentary.\n\n[170:2](sbe0824.htm#fr_782) The eight mentioned already.\n\n[170:3](sbe0824.htm#fr_783) Cf. Taitt. \xc3\x82ra _n_. p. 885.\n\n[170:4](sbe0824.htm#fr_784) Cf. Mu _nd_ aka, p. 312; _S_ anti Parvan (Moksha),\nchap. 199, st. 64 seq. Immortality = final emancipation.\n\n[170:5](sbe0824.htm#fr_785) p. 165 supra.\n\n[170:6](sbe0824.htm#fr_786) Of penance, that is to say.\n\n[170:7](sbe0824.htm#fr_787) Cf. Gita, [p. 109](sbe0816.htm#page_109) for the\ncollocation.\n\n[170:8](sbe0824.htm#fr_788) Ka _th_ opanishad, p. 151; Maitri, p. 161. _S_ a\n_n_ kara, seems to take the five and the senses separately; the five meaning\nthe five classes of sensuous objects.\n\n[170:9](sbe0824.htm#fr_789) Past losses and future gains, Nilaka _nth_ a.\n\n[171:1](sbe0824.htm#fr_790) Cf., as to this, Max Muller's Ancient Sanskrit\nLiterature, p. 38 seq.; and _Kh_ andogya, pp. 164, 474, 493; B _ri_ hadara _n_\nyaka, pp. 456, 687, 926; Maitri, p. 171; Nrisimha Tapini, p. 105.\n\n[171:2](sbe0824.htm#fr_791) The original is 'void of _Rik_ s.' The\ncommentators give no explanation. Does it mean those who abandon the karma-\nmarga? Heretics who reject all Vedas are scarcely likely to be referred to in\nthis way. Nilaka _nth_ a's interpretation of all this is very different. See\nhis gloss.\n\n[171:3](sbe0824.htm#fr_792) _S_ a _n_ kara gives various interpretations of\nthis. Perhaps the best is to take it as meaning knowledge. 'The one knowledge\n--the one truth'--would then be like the famous text--Taittiriya, p. 56--'The\nBrahman is truth, knowledge,' &c.\n\n[171:4](sbe0824.htm#fr_793) For this phrase cf. Gita, [p.\n73](sbe0808.htm#page_73).\n\n[171:5](sbe0824.htm#fr_794) Those who do not understand the Brahman lose their\nnatural power of obtaining what they wish, and so go in for various ceremonies\nfor various special benefits. Cf. _Kh_ andogya, p. 541; Gita, [p.\n47](sbe0804.htm#page_47); and [p. 184](sbe0825.htm#page_184) infra.\n\n[171:6](sbe0824.htm#fr_795) Cf. B _ri_ hadaranyaka, p. 893.\n\n[171:7](sbe0824.htm#fr_796) Ibid. p. 636.\n\n[171:8](sbe0824.htm#fr_797) Literally, 'highest among bipeds,' a rather\nunusual expression.\n\n[171:9](sbe0824.htm#fr_798) Nilaka _nth_ a says, 'The part of the Vedas which\nteaches the p. 172 knowledge of the supreme is enough by itself for its\npurpose; it is not like the part about rites, &c., which rites must be\nperformed before they serve any useful purpose.' The _G_ \xc3\xb1anakanda is enough\nby itself for understanding the Brahman. _S_ a _n_ kara compares Gita, [p.\n113](sbe0817.htm#page_113), and Ka _th_ a, p. 102.\n\n[172:1](sbe0824.htm#fr_799) The Veda = the Brahman, as above, cf. _S_ veta _s_\nvatara, p. 372 and commentary; that which is to be known = the material world,\nwhich is a subject for human knowledge.\n\n[172:2](sbe0824.htm#fr_800) Scil. understands the Veda--the Brahman.\n\n[172:3](sbe0824.htm#fr_801) 'The mind,' says Nilaka _nth_ a; literally, 'that\nwhich is to be understood.'\n\n[172:4](sbe0824.htm#fr_802) Because a real knowledge of it requires a\nknowledge of the Brahman. As to the next clause cf. inter alia _Kh_ andogya,\np. 384; B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p. 450.\n\n[172:5](sbe0824.htm#fr_803) This is the converse of the last sentence, as to\nwhich cf. B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p. 925.\n\n[172:6](sbe0824.htm#fr_804) The supreme.\n\n[172:7](sbe0824.htm#fr_805) The apparent contradiction is explained in the\nnext sentence.\n\n[172:8](sbe0824.htm#fr_806) I. e. the moon. This refers to the well-known _s_\nakha _k_ andranyaya. As the small digit of the moon, which cannot be perceived\nby itself, is pointed out as being at the tip of a branch of a tree pointing\ntowards the moon, so the Vedas are of use as pointing towards the Brahman,\nthough inaccurately and imperfectly.\n\n[173:1](sbe0824.htm#fr_807) Scil. in the manner just indicated.\n\n[173:2](sbe0824.htm#fr_808) As giving an idea of the Brahman. The first step\nto a knowledge of the Brahman is to 'hear' about it from Vedic texts. Cf. B\n_ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p. 925.\n\n[173:3](sbe0824.htm#fr_809) Such as the body, the senses, &c., which must be\ndistinguished as quite distinct from the self, though most often confounded\nwith it.\n\n[173:4](sbe0824.htm#fr_810) Such passages, namely, as 'Thou art that, I am the\nBrahman,' &c.\n\n[173:5](sbe0824.htm#fr_811) About the objects of the senses.\n\n[173:6](sbe0824.htm#fr_812) Cf. Ka _th_ a, p. 55.\n\n[173:7](sbe0824.htm#fr_813) Cf. _Kh_ andogya, p. 516. The Bhuman there is the\nsame as the Bahu here, viz. the Brahman. _S_ a _n_ kara says expressly in his\ncomment on the Upanishad text, that Bahu and Bhuman, among other words, are\nsynonyms.\n\n[173:8](sbe0824.htm#fr_814) Self-restraint, as explained before at p. 163.\n\n[173:9](sbe0824.htm#fr_815) Though this is not unimportant, as may be seen\nfrom the contrast between town and forest at _Kh_ andogya, p. 340. See also\nMaitri, p. 100; Mu _nd_ aka, p. 240. As to the 'highest sage,' see B _ri_\nhadara _n_ yaka, p. 899, where the passage about 'sacrifice, gift, penance'\nshould be compared with Gita, [p. 122](sbe0820.htm#page_122).\n\n[173:10](sbe0824.htm#fr_816) The construction in the original is not quite\nclear. I understand the sense to be as follows: In the science of the soul,\nthe p. 174 analyser (the word is the same as the word for grammarian) is he\nwho analyses objects, not words merely. Now the true analysis of objects\nreduces them all to the Brahman (cf. _Kh_ andogya, p. 407; B _ri_ hadara _n_\nyaka, p. 152); and the sage understands this, and makes the analysis\naccordingly, so he is rightly called an analyser.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VI](sbe0825.htm)\n\n"
