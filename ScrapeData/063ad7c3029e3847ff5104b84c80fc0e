Verily, the horse is slaughtered for all the deities: were he to\nmake it one belonging to Pra _g_ apati (exclusively), he would deprive the\ndeities who are co-sharers of their share. Having made ghee (to take the part\nof) portions (of the horse's body) he makes oblations 1 to the deities in\nmentioning them one by one with (Va _g_. S. XXV, 1-9), 'The Grass (I gratify)\nwith the teeth, the Lotus with the roots of the hair, . . . :' the deities who\nare co-sharers he thus supplies with their share. When he has offered the Ara\n_n_ ye\xe0\xa4\xbdnu _k_ ya (oblations) 2, he offers the last oblation to\n\np. 337\n\n[paragraph continues] Heaven and Earth; for all the gods are established in\nheaven and on earth: it is them he thereby gratifies. Now the gods and the\nAsuras were contending together.\n\n13:3:4:22\\. They (the gods) spake, 'We are the Agnaya _h_ Svish _t_ ak _ri_ ta\n_h_  1 of the horse (sacrifice); let us take out for ourselves a special\nshare: therewith we shall overcome the Asuras.' They took the blood for\nthemselves in order to overcome their rivals; when he offers the blood to the\nSvish _t_ ak _ri_ ts, it is in order to overcome (his own) rivals; and the\nspiteful rival of him who knows this is undone by himself.\n\n13:3:4:33\\. The first oblation (of blood) he offers 2 in the\n\np. 338\n\nthroat (gullet) of the Gom _ri_ ga 1; for Gom _ri_ gas are cattle, and the\nSvish _t_ ak _ri_ t is Rudra: he thus\n\np. 339\n\nshields the cattle from Rudra, whence Rudra does not prowl after the cattle\nwhere this oblation is offered at the A _s_ vamedha.\n\n13:3:4:44\\. The second oblation 1 he offers on a horse-hoof; for the one-\nhoofed (animals) are cattle, and the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t is Rudra: he thus\nshields the cattle from Rudra, whence Rudra does not prowl after the cattle\nwhere this oblation is offered at the A _s_ vamedha.\n\n13:3:4:55\\. The third oblation he offers in an iron bowl; for the people\n(subjects) are of iron 2, and the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t is Rudra: he thus\nshields the people from Rudra, whence Rudra does not prowl after the cattle\nwhere this oblation is offered at the A _s_ vamedha.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[336:1](sbe44097.htm#fr_859) These oblations of ghee, apparently amounting to\n132, are made, after the principal flesh-portions have been offered, viz. in\nthe interval between the ghee oblation to Vanaspati (the lord of the forest,\nor the plant, Soma) and the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t oblation, for which see part\nii, pp. 208-9; each formula, as a rule, containing the name of some divinity,\nand that of some part of the body of the horse supposed to be represented by\nthe ghee (by four ladlings of which the offering spoon is filled each time).\nMahidhara, apparently in accordance with the Brahma _n_ a, supplies 'pri _n_\nami (I gratify)' with each (complete) formula which then concludes with 'svaha\n(hail)!' According to other authorities, however, these formulas are each to\nbe divided into two separate dedicatory formulas:--'To the Grass hail! To the\nTeeth hail!' &c.--The last of the 132 oblations (with the formula, To _G_\numbaka, hail!') is, however, withheld for the present to be offered (or\nperhaps the formula alone is to be muttered) at the end of the purificatory\nbath (avabh _ri_ tha) towards the end of the sacrifice on the third day.\n\n[336:2](sbe44097.htm#fr_860) The term 'ara _n_ ye\xe0\xa4\xbdnu _k_ ya' ('to be recited\nin the forest') we met before (IX, 3, 1, 24) as applying to the last of seven\ncakes offered to the Maruts immediately after the installation of Agni (the\nsacred fire) on the newly-built altar The formula used for that cake is the\nso-called Vimukha-verse, Va _g_. S. XXXIX, 7. This p. 337 verse is followed in\nthe Sa _m_ hita by a series of twenty formulas (ib. 8-9) of a similar nature\nto those referred to in the preceding note (i.e. consisting each of a deity\nand a part of the body of the horse--'Agni I gratify with the heart,' &c.),\nand these again by forty-two expiatory formulas ('To the hair, hail!' &c., ib.\n10-13), ending with, 'To Yama, hail! To Antaka (the Ender), hail! To Death,\nhail! To (the) Brahman, hail! To Brahman-slaying, hail! To the All-gods, hail!\nTo Heaven and Earth, hail!' These sixty-two formulas are used with as many\nghee-oblations, which are to be performed immediately after the 131st of the\nprevious set of oblations. Prior, however, again to the last of the forty-two\nexpiatory oblations, (viz. the one made with 'To Heaven and Earth, hail!')\nthere is another set of sixteen oblations ([XIII, 3, 6,\n1](sbe44099.htm#13:3:6:1) seqq.), the so-called 'A _s_ vastomiya ahutaya _h_ '\nor 'oblations relating to the Stomas of the horse (sacrifice),' each of which\nhas a complete couplet for its offering-formula (Va _g_. S. XXV, 24-39). At\nthe end of the three sets of oblations the term 'ara _n_ ye\xe0\xa4\xbdnu _k_ ya' is here\nextended by the author. At the end of the third set this succession of ghee-\noblations is concluded with the last expiatory oblation, that to Heaven. and\nEarth; whereupon the ordinary flesh-oblation to Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t is\nperformed.\n\n[337:1](sbe44097.htm#fr_861) I.e. the (three) fires, the makers of good\noffering.\n\n[337:2](sbe44097.htm#fr_862) The formula for each of these three special\nblood-oblations--p. 338 offered immediately after the ordinary Svish _t_ ak\n_ri_ t oblation, and being, in fact, the special Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t of the A\n_s_ vamedha--is 'Agnibhya _h_ svish _t_ ak _ri_ dbhya _h_ svaha, i.e. to the\n(three) Agnis, the makers of good offering, hail!'\n\n[338:1](sbe44097.htm#fr_863) 'Gom _ri_ ga' is usually taken by the\ncommentators, and in our dictionaries, as another name of the 'Gavaya,'\nvariously called Gayal, Bos Gavaeus, Bos frontalis, or Bos cavifrons, a\nspecies of wild cattle found in various mountain districts of India\n(especially on the eastern boundaries of Bengal, and in Malabar, as also in\nCeylon), and frequently domesticated amongst the hill-tribes, by whom it is\nvalued for its flesh and milk (cf. Colebrooke's paper, As. Res. VIII, p. 511\nseqq.). The Gavaya itself is, however, as Colebrooke remarks, confounded by\nsome Sanskrit writers with the ' _Ri_ _s_ ya,' which he takes to be the buck\nof the painted, or white-footed (or slate-coloured) Antelope, the Portax\npictus (or Antelope picta), also called by the vernacular names of Nilgau or\n(Mahr.) Nilgay, whilst the female is called 'rohit' in Sanskrit. All these\nthree animals occur amongst the wild animals to be used as quasi-victims, but\nultimately released on the second day of the A _s_ vamedha; and I am inclined\nto think that they are three different animals. To show that the Ri _s_ ya and\nthe Gavaya cannot be the same animals, Colebrooke already refers to the fact\nthat three _Ri_ _s_ yas (consecrated to the Vasus) and three Gavayas (to B\n_ri_ haspati) occur as victims side by side in Va _g_ asaneyi-sa _m_ hita XXIV\n(27 and 28); and in the same way a Gom _ri_ ga, sacred to Pra _g_ apati and\nVayu, is mentioned immediately after, ib. 30; whilst another, sacred to Pra\n_g_ apati, was, as we saw, one of the two animals tied along with the horse to\nthe central stake (see [XIII, 2, 2, 2](sbe44084.htm#13:2:2:2)). Taitt. S. II,\n1, 10, 2, treating of the sacrifice of a Gom _ri_ ga to Vayu, remarks that it\nis neither a domestic animal (or cattle, pa _s_ u) nor a wild one; and Saya\n_n_ a explains it as a cross between a female deer (or antelope, m _ri_ gi)\nand a hull that has gone with his cows to graze in the forest; whilst, on\nTaitt. Br. III, 8, 20, 5, he leaves one to choose between its being a vicious\nbull (dhurto balivarda _h_ ), dangerous to men, or an animal 'of mixed breed,\nsprung from a cow and a male gazelle or antelope (gohari _n_ ayo _h_ , or\npossibly, from parent beasts of the bovine and antelope species).' In this\nlatter passage, the editor p. 339 of the Brahma _n_ a (in the list of\ncontents, p. 53) takes it to mean 'wild cattle (Nilagao gom _ri_ ga,\nerroneously explained as a cross between a deer and a cow),' which would be a\nprobable enough explanation, if the Ri _s_ ya were not the Nilgau; whilst\notherwise the animal might belong to some other species of bovine antelopes no\nlonger found in India.\n\n[339:1](sbe44097.htm#fr_864) Whilst the first of these oblations must take\nplace immediately after the ordinary Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t of the animal\nsacrifice, the second may be postponed till after the 'after-offerings'; and\nthe third till after the 'Patnisa _m_ ya _g_ as.' See also [XIII, 5, 3,\n8](sbe44108.htm#13:5:3:8) seq.\n\n[339:2](sbe44097.htm#fr_865) That is, their value--as compared with that of\nthe king or nobles, and the Brahma _n_ as--is that of iron, compared with that\nof gold and silver; cp. [XIII, 2, 2, 19](sbe44084.htm#13:2:2:19).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 3, 5. Fifth Brahma _n_ a](sbe44098.htm)\n\n"
