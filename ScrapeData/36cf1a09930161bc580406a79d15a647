Once upon a time they had travelled far afield, and were\nreturning home with a great deal of money which they had obtained by selling\ntheir wares. Now there happened to be a dense forest near their village, and\nthis they reached early one morning. In it there lived three notorious\nrobbers, of whose existence the traders had never heard, and while they were\nstill in the middle of it the robbers stood before them, with swords and\ncudgels in their hands, and ordered them to lay down all they had. The traders\nhad no weapons with them, and so, though they were many more in number, they\nhad to submit them-selves to the robbers, who took away everything from them,\neven the very clothes they wore, and gave to each only a small loin-cloth a\nspan in breadth and a cubit in length.\n\nThe idea that they had conquered ten men and plundered all their property, now\ntook possession of the robbers\' minds. They seated themselves like three\nmonarches before the men they had plundered, and ordered them to dance to them\nbefore returning home. The merchants now mourned their fate. They had lost all\nthey had, except their loincloth, and still the robbers were not satisfied,\nbut ordered them to dance.\n\nThere was, among the ten merchants, one who was very clever. He pondered over\n. calamity that had come upon him and his friends, the dance they would have\nto perform, and the magnificent manner in which the three robbers had seated\nthemselves on the grass. At the same time he observed that these last had\nplaced their weapons on the ground, in the assurance of having thoroughly\ncowed the traders, who were now commencing to dance. So he took the lead in\nthe dance, and, as a song is always sung by the leader on such occasions, to\nwhich the rest keep time with hands and feet, he thus began to sing:\n\n\'We are enty men,  \nThey are erith men:  \nIf each erith man,  \nSurround eno men  \nEno man remains.  \n_Ta, tai, tom, tadingana."\n\n_\n\nThe robbers were all uneducated, and thought that the leader was merely\nsinging a song as usual. So it was in one sense; for the leader commenced from\na distance, and had sung the song over twice before he and his companions\ncommenced to approach the robbers. They had understood his meaning, because\nthey had been trained in trade.\n\nWhen two traders discuss the price of an article in the presence of a\npurchaser, they use a riddling sort of language.\n\n![](img/52.jpg)\n\n"What is the price of this cloth?" one trader will ask another.\n\n"Enty rupees," another will reply, meaning "ten rupees."\n\nThus, there is no possibility of the purchaser knowing what is meant unless he\nbe acquainted with trade language. By the rules of this secret language erith\nmeans "three" enty means "ten," and eno means "one." So the leader by his song\nmeant to hint to his fellow-traders that they were ten men, the robbers only\nthree, that if three pounced upon each of the robbers, nine of them could hold\nthem down, while the remaining one bound the robbers\' hands and feet.\n\n![](img/53.jpg)\n\nThe three thieves, glorying in their victory, and little understanding the\nmeaning of the song and the intentions of the dancers, were proudly seated\nchewing betel and tobacco. Meanwhile the song was sung a third time. _Ta tai\ntom_ had left the lips of the singer; and, before _tadingana_ was out of them,\nthe traders separated into parties of three, and each party pounced upon a\nthief. The remaining one--the leader himself--tore up into long narrow strips\na large piece of cloth, six cubits long, and tied the hands and feet of the\nrobbers. These were entirely humbled now, and rolled on the ground like three\nbags of rice!\n\n![](img/54.jpg)\n\nThe ten traders now took back all their property, and armed themselves with\nthe swords and cudgels of their enemies; and when they reached their village,\nthey often amused their friends and relatives by relating their adventure.\n\n![](img/55.jpg)\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Raja Rasalu](ift20.htm)\n\n'
