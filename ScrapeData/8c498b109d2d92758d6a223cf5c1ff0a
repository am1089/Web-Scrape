There\nare some departments, however, which are yet but partially and imperfectly\ninvestigated; and we are far from being in possession of that knowledge which\nthe authentic writings of the Hindus alone can give us of their religion,\nmythology, and historical traditions.\n\nFrom the materials to which we have hitherto had access, it seems probable\nthat there have been three principal forms in which the religion of the Hindus\nhas existed, at as many different periods. The duration of those periods, the\ncircumstances of their succession, and the precise state of the national faith\nat each season, it is not possible to trace with any approach to accuracy. The\npremises have been too imperfectly determined to authorize other than\nconclusions of a general and somewhat vague description, and those remain to\nbe hereafter confirmed or corrected by more extensive and satisfactory\nresearch.\n\nThe earliest form under which the Hindu religion appears is that taught in the\nVedas. The style of the language, and the purport of the composition of those\nworks, as far as we are acquainted with them, indicate a date long anterior to\nthat of any other class of Sanscrit writings. It is yet, however, scarcely\nsafe to advance an opinion of the precise belief or philosophy which they\ninculcate. To enable us to judge of their tendency, we have only a general\nsketch of their arrangement and contents, with a few extracts, by Mr.\nColebrooke, in the Asiatic Researches 1; a few incidental observations by Mr.\nEllis, in the same miscellany 2; and a translation of the first book of the\nSanhita, or collection of the prayers of the Rig-veda, by Dr. Rosen 3; and\nsome of the Upanishads,\n\np. ii\n\nor speculative treatises, attached to, rather than part of, the Vedas, by\nRammohun Roy 4. Of the religion taught in the Vedas, Mr. Colebrooke\'s opinion\nwill probably be received as that which is best entitled to deference, as\ncertainly no Sanscrit scholar has been equally conversant with the original\nworks. "The real doctrine of the Indian scripture is the unity of the Deity,\nin whom the universe is comprehended; and the seeming polytheism which it\nexhibits, offers the elements and the stars and planets as gods. The three\nprincipal manifestations of the divinity, with other personified attributes\nand energies, and most of the other gods of Hindu mythology, are indeed\nmentioned, or at least indicated, in the Veda. But the worship of deified\nheroes is no part of the system; nor are the incarnations of deities suggested\nin any portion of the text which I have yet seen, though such are sometimes\nhinted at by the commentators 5." Some of these statements may perhaps require\nmodification; for without a careful examination of all the prayers of the\nVedas, it would be hazardous to assert that they contain no indication\nwhatever of hero-worship; and certainly they do appear to allude occasionally\nto the Avataras, or incarnations, of Vishn\xcc\x81u. Still, however, it is true that\nthe prevailing character of the ritual of the Vedas is the worship of the\npersonified elements; of Agni, or fire; Indra, the firmament; Vayu, the air;\nVarun\xcc\x81a, the water; of Aditya, the sun; Soma, the moon; and other elementary\nand planetary personages. It is also true that the worship of the Vedas is for\nthe most part domestic worship, consisting of prayers and oblations offered--\nin their own houses, not in temples--by individuals for individual good, and\naddressed to unreal presences, not to visible types. In a word, the religion\nof the Vedas was not idolatry.\n\nIt is not possible to conjecture when this more simple and primitive form of\nadoration was succeeded by the worship of images and types, representing\nBrahma, Vishn\xcc\x81u, \xc5\x9aiva, and other imaginary beings, constituting a mythological\npantheon of most ample extent; or when Rama\n\np. iii\n\nand Krishn\xcc\x81a, who appear to have been originally real and historical\ncharacters, were elevated to the dignity of divinities. Image-worship is\nalluded to by Manu in several passages 6, but with an intimation that those\nBrahmans who subsist by ministering in temples are an inferior and degraded\nclass. The story of the Ramayan\xcc\x81a and Mahabharata turns wholly upon the\ndoctrine of incarnations, all the chief dramatis personae of the poems being\nimpersonations of gods and demigods and celestial spirits. The ritual appears\nto be that of the Vedas, and it may be doubted if any allusion to image-\nworship occurs; but the doctrine of propitiation by penance and praise\nprevails throughout, and Vishn\xcc\x81u and \xc5\x9aiva are the especial objects of\npanegyric and invocation. In these two works, then, we trace unequivocal\nindications of a departure from the elemental worship of the Vedas, and the\norigin or elaboration of legends, which form the great body of the\nmythological religion of the Hindus. How far they only improved upon the\ncosmogony and chronology of their predecessors, or in what degree the\ntraditions of families and dynasties may originate with them, are questions\nthat can only be determined when the Vedas and the two works in question shall\nhave been more thoroughly examined.\n\nThe different works known by the name of Puran\xcc\x81as are evidently derived from\nthe same religious system as the Ramayan\xcc\x81a and Mahabharata, or from the mytho-\nheroic stage of Hindu belief. They present, however, peculiarities which\ndesignate their belonging to a later period, and to an important modification\nin the progress of opinion. They repeat the theoretical cosmogony of the two\ngreat poems; they expand and systematize the chronological computations; and\nthey give a more definite and connected representation of the mythological\nfictions, and the historical traditions. But besides these and other\nparticulars, which may be derivable from an old, if not from a primitive era,\nthey offer characteristic peculiarities of a more modern description, in the\nparamount importance which they assign to individual divinities, in the\nvariety and purport of the rites and observances addressed to them, and in the\ninvention of new legends illustrative of the power and graciousness of\n\np. iv\n\nthose deities, and of the efficacy of implicit devotion to them. \xc5\x9aiva and\nVishn\xcc\x81u, under one or other form, are almost the sole objects that claim the\nhomage of the Hindus in the Puran\xcc\x81as; departing from the domestic and\nelemental ritual of the Vedas, and exhibiting a sectarial fervour and\nexclusiveness not traceable in the Ramayan\xcc\x81a, and only to a qualified extent\nin the Mahabharata. They are no longer authorities for Hindu belief as a\nwhole: they are special guides for separate and sometimes conflicting branches\nof it, compiled for the evident purpose of promoting the preferential, or in\nsome cases the sole, worship of Vishn\xcc\x81u or of \xc5\x9aiva 7.\n\nThat the Puran\xcc\x81as always bore the character here given of them, may admit of\nreasonable doubt; that it correctly applies to them as they now are met with,\nthe following pages will irrefragably substantiate. It is possible, however,\nthat there may have been an earlier class of Puran\xcc\x81as, of which those we now\nhave are but the partial and adulterated representatives. The identity of the\nlegends in many of them, and still more the identity of the words--for in\nseveral of them long passages are literally the same--is a sufficient proof\nthat in all such cases they must be copied either from some other similar\nwork, or from a common and prior original. It is not unusual also for a fact\nto be stated upon the authority of an \'old stanza,\' which is cited\naccordingly; shewing the existence of an earlier source of information: and in\nvery many instances legends are alluded to, not told; evincing acquaintance\nwith their prior narration somewhere else. The name itself, Puran\xcc\x81a, which\nimplies \'old,\' indicates the object of the compilation to be the preservation\nof ancient traditions, a purpose in the present condition of the Puran\xcc\x81as very\nimperfectly fulfilled. Whatever weight may be attached to these\nconsiderations, there is no disputing evidence to the like effect afforded by\nother and unquestionable authority. The description given by Mr. Colebrooke 8\nof the contents of a Puran\xcc\x81a is taken from Sanscrit writers. The Lexicon of\nAmara Sinha gives as a synonyme of Puran\xcc\x81a, Pancha-lakshanam, \'that which has\nfive characteristic topics:\' and there is no difference of opinion amongst the\n\np. v\n\nscholiasts as to what these are. They are, as Mr. Colebrooke mentions, 1.\nPrimary creation, or cosmogony; 2. Secondary creation, or the destruction and\nrenovation of worlds, including chronology; 3. Genealogy of gods and\npatriarchs; 4. Reigns of the Manus, or periods called Manwantaras; and 5.\nHistory, or such particulars as have been preserved of the princes of the\nsolar and lunar races, and of their descendants to modern times 9. Such, at\nany rate, were the constituent and characteristic portions of a Puran\xcc\x81a in the\ndays of Amara Sinha, fifty-six years before the Christian era; and if the\nPuran\xcc\x81as had undergone no change since his time, such we should expect to find\nthem still. Do they conform to this description? Not exactly in any one\ninstance: to some of them it is utterly inapplicable; to others it only\npartially applies. There is not one to which it belongs so entirely as to the\nVishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a, and it is one of the circumstances which gives to this work a\nmore authentic character than most of its fellows can pretend to. Yet even in\nthis instance we have a book upon the institutes of society and obsequial\nrites interposed between the Manwantaras and the genealogies of princes, and a\nlife of Krishn\xcc\x81a separating the latter from an account of the end of the\nworld, besides the insertion of various legends of a manifestly popular and\nsectarial character. No doubt many of the Puran\xcc\x81as, as they now are,\ncorrespond with the view which Col. Vans Kennedy takes of their purport. "I\ncannot discover in them," he remarks, "any other object than that of religious\ninstruction." The description of the earth and of the planetary system, and\nthe lists of royal races which occur in them, he asserts to be "evidently\nextraneous, and not essential circumstances, as they are entirely omitted in\nsome Puran\xcc\x81as, and very concisely illustrated in others; while, on the\ncontrary, in all the Puran\xcc\x81as some or other of the leading principles, rites,\nand observances of the Hindu religion are fully dwelt upon, and illustrated\neither by suitable legends\n\np. vi\n\nor by prescribing the ceremonies to be practised, and the prayers and\ninvocations to be employed, in the worship of different deities 10," Now,\nhowever accurate this description may be of the Puran\xcc\x81as as they are, it is\nclear that it does not apply to what they were when they were synonymously\ndesignated as Pancha-lakshan\xcc\x81as, or \'treatises on five topics;\' not one of\nwhich five is ever specified by text or comment to be "religious instruction."\nIn the knowledge of Amara Sinha the lists of princes were not extraneous and\nunessential, and their being now so considered by a writer so well acquainted\nwith the contents of the Puran\xcc\x81as as Col. Vans Kennedy is a decisive proof\nthat since the days of the lexicographer they have undergone some material\nalteration, and that we have not at present the same works in all respects\nthat were current under the denomination of Puran\xcc\x81as in the century prior to\nChristianity.\n\nThe inference deduced from the discrepancy between the actual form and the\nolder definition of a Puran\xcc\x81a, unfavourable to the antiquity of the extant\nworks generally, is converted into certainty when we come to examine them in\ndetail; for although they have no dates attached to them, yet circumstances\nare sometimes mentioned or alluded to, or references to authorities are made,\nor legends are narrated, or places are particularized, of which the\ncomparatively recent date is indisputable, and which enforce a corresponding\nreduction of the antiquity of the work in which they are discovered. At the\nsame time they may be acquitted of subservience to any but sectarial\nimposture. They were pious frauds for temporary purposes: they never emanated\nfrom any impossible combination of the Brahmans to fabricate for the antiquity\nof the entire Hindu system any claims which it cannot fully support. A very\ngreat portion of the contents of many, some portion of the contents of all, is\ngenuine and old. The sectarial interpolation or embellishment is always\nsufficiently palpable to be set aside, without injury to the more authentic\nand primitive material; and the Puran\xcc\x81as, although they belong especially to\nthat stage of the Hindu religion in which faith in some one divinity was the\nprevailing principle, are also a valuable record of the form of Hindu belief\n\np. vii\n\nwhich came next in order to that of the Vedas; which grafted hero-worship upon\nthe simpler ritual of the latter; and which had been adopted, and was\nextensively, perhaps universally established in India at the time of the Greek\ninvasion. The Hercules of the Greek writers was indubitably the Balarama of\nthe Hindus; and their notices of Mathura on the Jumna, and of the kingdom of\nthe Suraseni and the Pandaean country, evidence the prior currency of the\ntraditions which constitute the argument of the Mahabharata, and which are\nconstantly repeated in the Puran\xcc\x81as, relating to the Pan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ava and Yadava\nraces, to Krishn\xcc\x81a and his contemporary heroes, and to the dynasties of the\nsolar and lunar kings.\n\nThe theogony and cosmogony of the Puran\xcc\x81as may probably be traced to the\nVedas. They are not, as far as is yet known, described in detail in those\nworks, but they are frequently alluded to in a strain more or less mystical\nand obscure, which indicates acquaintance with their existence, and which\nseems to have supplied the Puran\xcc\x81as with the groundwork of their systems. The\nscheme of primary or elementary creation they borrow from the Sankhya\nphilosophy, which is probably one of the oldest forms of speculation on man\nand nature amongst the Hindus. Agreeably, however, to that part of the\nPauran\xcc\x81ik character which there is reason to suspect of later origin, their\ninculcation of the worship of a favourite deity, they combine the\ninterposition of a creator with the independent evolution of matter in a\nsomewhat contradictory and unintelligible style. It is evident too that their\naccounts of secondary creation, or the developement of the existing forms of\nthings, and the disposition of the universe, are derived from several and\ndifferent sources; and it appears very likely that they are to be accused of\nsome of the incongruities and absurdities by which the narrative is\ndisfigured, in consequence of having attempted to assign reality and\nsignificancy to what was merely metaphor or mysticism. There is, however,\namidst the unnecessary complexity of the description, a general agreement\namongst them as to the origin of things, and their final distribution; and in\nmany of the circumstances there is a striking concurrence with the ideas which\nseem to have pervaded the whole of the ancient world, and which we may\ntherefore believe to be faithfully represented in the Puran\xcc\x81as.\n\np. viii\n\nThe Pantheism of the Puran\xcc\x81as is one of their invariable characteristics,\nalthough the particular divinity, who is all things, from whom all things\nproceed, and to whom all things return, be diversified according to their\nindividual sectarial bias. They seem to have derived the notion from the\nVedas: but in them the one universal Being is of a higher order than a\npersonification of attributes or elements, and, however imperfectly conceived,\nor unworthily described, is God. In the Puran\xcc\x81as the one only Supreme Being is\nsupposed to be manifest in the person of \xc5\x9aiva or Vishn\xcc\x81u, either in the way of\nillusion or in sport; and one or other of these divinities is therefore also\nthe cause of all that is, is himself all that exists. The identity of God and\nnature is not a new notion; it was very general in the speculations of\nantiquity, but it assumed a new vigour in the early ages of Christianity, and\nwas carried to an equal pitch of extravagance by the Platonic Christians as by\nthe \xc5\x9aaiva or Vaishn\xcc\x81ava Hindus. It seems not impossible that there was some\ncommunication between them. We know that there was an active communication\nbetween India and the Red sea in the early ages of the Christian era, and that\ndoctrines, as well as articles of merchandise, were brought to Alexandria from\nthe former. Epiphanius 11 and Eusebius 12 accuse Scythianus of having imported\nfrom India, in the second century, books on magic, and heretical notions\nleading to Manichaeism; and it was at the same period that Ammonius instituted\nthe sect of the new Platonists at Alexandria. The basis of his heresy was,\nthat true philosophy derived its origin from the eastern nations: his doctrine\nof the identity of God and the universe is that of the Vedas and Puran\xcc\x81as; and\nthe practices he enjoined, as well as their object, were precisely those\ndescribed in several of the Puran\xcc\x81as under the name of Yoga. His disciples\nwere taught "to extenuate by mortification and contemplation the bodily\nrestraints upon the immortal spirit, so that in this life they might enjoy\ncommunion with the Supreme Being, and ascend after death to the universal\nParent 13." That these are Hindu tenets the following pages 14 will testify;\nand by the admission of their Alexandrian\n\np. ix\n\nteacher, they originated in India. The importation was perhaps not wholly\nunrequited; the loan may not have been left unpaid. It is not impossible that\nthe Hindu doctrines received fresh animation from their adoption by the\nsuccessors of Ammonius, and especially by the mystics, who may have prompted,\nas well as employed, the expressions of the Puran\xcc\x81as. Anquetil du Perron has\ngiven 15, in the introduction to his translation of the \'Oupnekhat,\' several\nhymns by Synesius, a bishop of the beginning of the fifth century, which may\nserve as parallels to many of the hymns and prayers addressed to Vishn\xcc\x81u in\nthe Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a.\n\nBut the ascription to individual and personal deities of the attributes of the\none universal and spiritual Supreme Being, is an indication of a later date\nthan the Vedas certainly, and apparently also than the Ramayan\xcc\x81a, where Rama,\nalthough an incarnation of Vishn\xcc\x81u, commonly appears in his human character\nalone. There is something of the kind in the Mahabharata in respect to\nKrishn\xcc\x81a, especially in the philosophical episode known as the Bhagavad Gita.\nIn other places the divine nature of Krishn\xcc\x81a is less decidedly affirmed; in\nsome it is disputed or denied; and in most of the situations in which he is\nexhibited in action, it is as a prince and warrior, not as a divinity. He\nexercises no superhuman faculties in the defence of himself or his friends, or\nin the defeat and destruction of his foes. The Mahabharata, however, is\nevidently a work of various periods, and requires to be read throughout\ncarefully and critically before its weight as an authority can be accurately\nappreciated. As it is now in type 16\\--thanks to the public spirit of the\nAsiatic Society of Bengal, and their secretary Mr. J. Prinsep--it will not be\nlong before the Sanscrit scholars of the continent will accurately appreciate\nits value.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[i:1](vp001.htm#fr_0) Vol. VIII. p. 369.\n\n[i:2](vp001.htm#fr_1) Vol. XIV. p. 37.\n\n[i:3](vp001.htm#fr_2) Published by the Oriental Translation Fund Committee.\n\n[ii:4](vp001.htm#fr_3) A translation of the principal Upanishads was published\nunder the title of Oupnekhat, or Theologia Indica, by Anquetil du Perron: but\nit was made through the medium of the Persian, and is very p. iii incorrect\nand obscure.
