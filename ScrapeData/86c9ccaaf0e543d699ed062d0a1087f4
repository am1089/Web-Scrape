Narada said :-- O Lord of the Devas! Kindly say in what Loka did Ganga go\nafter 5000 (five thousand) years of the Kali Yuga?\n\n\n\n2-4. Naraya _n_ a said :-- The Bhagirathi Ganga came down to Bharata under the\ncurse of Bharati; and when the term expired, She went back, by the Will of\nGod, to the region of Vaiku _nt_ ha. Also at the end of the period of their\ncurses, Bharati and, Lak _s_ mi, too, left Bharata and repaired to Naraya _n_\na. Ganga, Lak _s_ mi, and Sarasvati, these three and Tulasi all these four are\nso very dear to S\xc2\x92ri Hari.\n\n\n\n5-6. Narada said :-- How did Ganga appear from the lotus feet of Vi _sn_ u?\nWhy did Brahma put Her in His Kama _nd_ alu? I have heard that Ganga is the\nwife of S\xc2\x92iva; how then, came She to be the wife of Naraya _n_ a? Kindly\ndescribe all these in detail to me.\n\n\n\n7-8. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Muni! In ancient times, in the region of Goloka,\nGanga assumed the liquid appearance. She was born of the bodies of Radha and\nKri _sn_ a. So She is of the nature of both of them and their parts. Ganga is\nthe presiding deity of water. She is unequalled in Her beauty in this world.\nShe is full of youth and adorned with all ornaments.\n\n\n\n9-43. Her face was like the autumnal mid-day lotus and sweet smile was always\nreigning on Her lips; Her form was very beautiful; Her colour was as bright as\nmelted gold and She looked brilliant like the Autumnal Moon. Eyes and mind get\ncool and become pleasant at Her beauty and radiance; She was of purely Suddha\nSattva; Her loins were bulky and hard and She was covered with excellent\nclothings all over Her body. Her breasts were plump and prominent; they were\nraised, hard, and nicely round. Her eyes very fascinating, always casting\nsidelong glances. Her braids of hair situated a little oblique and the garland\nof Malati flowers over it made Her look extremely handsome. The saudalpaste\ndot and the vermillion dot were seen on Her forehead. On Her cheeks the leaves\nof musk were drawn and Her lips were red like Bandhuka flowers and they looked\nenchanting. Her rows of teeth looked like rows of ripe pomegranates; the ends\nof Her cloth not inflammable by fire, worn in front in a knot round the waist.\nShe sat by the side of Kri _sn_ a, full of amorous desires, and abashed. She\ncovered Her face with the end of Her cloth and was seeing, with a steadfast\ngaze the face of the Lord and She was drinking the nectar\n\n\n\np. 856\n\n\n\nof His face with great gladness. Her lotus face bloomed and became gladdened\nat the expectation of a first amorous embrace. She fainted on seeing the Form\nof Her Lord and a thrill of joy passed all over Her body. In the meanwhile\nRadhika came up there. Radha was attended by thirty ko _t_ is of Gopis. She\nlooked brilliant like tens of millions of Moons. Seeing Ganga by the side of\nS\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, Her face and eyes became reddened with anger like a red\nlotus. Her colour was yellow like champaka and Her gait was like a maddened\nelephant. She was adorned with various invaluable ornaments made of jewels.\nHer pair of clothings were tied round Her waist. They were decked with\ninvaluable jewels and not inflammable by fire (fire-proof). The Arghya offered\nby S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a was on Her lotus-feet of the colour of a flowering shrub,\nHibiscus mutabilis, and She was going slowly step by step. The Ri _s_ is began\nto fan Her with white Chamaras no sooner She, descending from the excellent\naeroplane decked with jewels, began to walk. Below the point where the parting\nof the hairs on the head is done, there was the dot of Sindura on Her\nforehead. It looked brilliant like a bright lamp flame. On both sides of this\nSindurabindu, the dot of musk and the dot of Sandal-paste were seen. When She\nbegan to quiver with anger, Her braid, with Parijata garland round it began to\ntremble also. Her lips adorned with beautiful colours, began to quiver also.\nShe took Her seat angrily on a jewel throne by the side of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a.\nHer attendants took their seats in their allotted positions. Seeing Radha,\nS\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a got up at once from His seat with reverence and addressed Her,\nsmiling and began to converse with Her in sweet words. The Gopis, very much\nafraid and with their heads bent low, began to chant hymns to Her with\ndevotion. S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a also began to praise Her with stotras. At this\nmoment Ganga Devi got up and praised Her with various hymns and asked Her\nwelfare with fear and with humble words. Out of fear, Her throat, lips and\npalate were parched up. She took refuge humbly at S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a's feet. S\xc2\x92ri\nKri _sn_ a then, took Ganga Devi on His breast when She became calm and quiet.\nAt this interval Sures'vari Ganga looked at Radha, seated on a throne, lovely\nand sweet, as if She was burning with Brahma Fire. Since the beginning of\ncreation, She is the Sole Lady of innumerable Brahmas and She is Eternal. At\nthe first sight, She looked young as if of twelve years old. Nowhere in any\nUniverse can be seen a lady so beautiful and so qualified. She was peaceful,\ncalm and quiet, lovely, infinite and having no beginning nor end. She was\nauspicious, well endowed with all auspicious signs, prosperous, and having the\ngood fortune of having a best\n\n\n\np. 857\n\n\n\nhusband. She was the foremost jewel amongst the ladies and appeared as if all\nthe beauties were concentrated in Her. Radha is the (left) half of S\xc2\x92ri Kri\n_sn_ a's body; whether in age or in strength or in beauty she was in every way\nperfectly equal to S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a. Lak _s_ mi and the Lord of Lak _s_ mi both\nworship Radha. The excellent brilliance of Sri Kri _sn_ a was overpowered by\nthe beauty of Radha. Taking Her seat on the throne She began to chew betels\noffered by Her attendants (Sakhis). She is the Mother of all the worlds; but\nno one is Her mother. She is fortunate, respected and proud. She is the Ruling\nLady of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a's Life and Soul and ever dearer to Him than His Pra\n_n_ a (vital breath). O Devar _s_ i! Ganga, the Governess of the Devas, looked\nat Her over and over again with a steadfast gaze; but Her eyes and mind were\nnot at all satiated. At this moment, Radha addressed smilingly to S\xc2\x92ri Kri\n_sn_ a, the Lord of the world, humbly and in sweet words. O My Lord! Who is\nthat Lady sitting by Thy side, looking askance, eager and with a smiling\ncountenance. She is enchanted with Thy beauteous form and fainting away. Her\nwhole body is excited with rapturous joy. Hiding Her face with cloth She is\nfrequently looking at Thee. Thou also dost look on Her smilingly and with\ndesires. What are all these? Even during My presence in this Goloka, all these\nbad practices are being rampant.\n\n\n\n44-51. It is Thou that art doing all these bad things often and often! We are\nfemale sex; what shall we do? We are naturally, of a very pleasing temper,\nsimple. I bore and forgave all these out of our love. O Licentious One! Take\nThy Beloved and go away quickly from this Goloka. Otherwise these things will\nnot bid fair to Thee. Firstly, one day I saw Thee, united with Viraja Gopi, in\nChandana (Sandal wood) forest. What to do? At the request of the S'akhis, I\ndid forgive Thee. Then, hearing My footsteps Thou didst fly away. Viraja, out\nof shame, quitted Her body and assumed the form of a river. That is million\nYojanas wide an four times as long. Even to this day that Viraja is existing,\ntestifying to Thy Glory (near Puri, Jagannatha)! When I went back to My home\nThou didst go to Viraja again and cried aloud \xc2\x93O Viraje! O Viraje!\xc2\x94 Hearing\nYour cry, Viraja, the Siddha Yogini arose from the waters, out of Her Yogic\npower, and when She showed Thee Her divine appearance decked with ornaments,\nThou didst draw Her to Thy side and cast Thy seed in Her. It is owing to the\ncasting of that seed in the womb of Viraja that the seven oceans have come\ninto existence!\n\n\n\n52-107. Secondly, one day I saw Thee in actual intercourse with the Gopi named\nS'obha! Hearing My footsteps, Thou fled'st away that day also.\n\n\n\np. 858\n\n\n\nOut of shame S'obha quitted Her body and departed to the sphere of Moon\n(Chandra Man _d_ al). The cooling effect of the Moon is due to this S'obha.\nWhen S\xc2\x92obha was thus distressed, Thou didst divide Her and put some parts to\ngems and jewels, part to gold, partly to excellent pearls and gems, partly on\nthe face of women, partly to the bodies of Kings, partly to the leaves of\ntrees, partly to flowers, partly to ripe fruits, partly to corns, partly to\npalaces and temples, partly to purified materials, partly to young and tender\nshoots and foliage, and partly to milk. Thirdly, I saw Thee united with Prabha\nGopi in Brindaban. Thou fled'st away, hearing My footsteps. Out of shame,\nPrabha quitted Her body and departed to the Solar atmosphere. This Prabha\n(lustre) is fierce luminosity of the Solar atmosphere. Out of the pangs of\nseparation Thou criedest and didst divide Prabha and didst put some parts in\nFire, partly amidst the Yak _s_ as, partly into lions, among men, partly\namongst the Devas, partly in Vai _sn_ avas, partly in serpents, partly in\nBrahma _n_ as, partly in Munis, partly in ascetics, and partly in fortunate\nand prosperous ladies. Thou hadst to weep then after Thou hadst thus divided\nPrabha, for Her separation and and fourthly I saw Thee in love union with the\nGopi S'anti in Rasa Man _d_ alam. On the coming of the spring season, one day\nThou with garlands of flowers on Thy neck and with Thy body besmeared with\nsandal paste and decked with ornaments, wast sleeping on a bed of flowers with\nS\xc2\x92anti Gopi, decked with gems, in a temple made of gems and pearls and\nillumined by a lamp of jewels and Thou wast chewing the betel, given by Thy\nbeloved. Hearing My sound Thou fled'st away. S\xc2\x92anti Gopi, too, out of fear and\nshame quitted Her body and disappeared in Thee. Therefore S\xc2\x92anti is reckoned\nas one of the noblest qualities. Out of the pain of separation, Thou didst\ndivide the body of S\xc2\x92anti and distributed partly to forests, partly to Brahma,\npartly to Me, partly to S'uddha Sattva Lak _s_ mi, partly to Thy Mantra\nworshippers, partly to My Mantra worshippers, partly to the ascetics, partly\nto Dharma, and partly to the religious persons. Fifthly, dost Thou remember\nthat one day anointing all over Thy body fully with the sandal paste and good\nscent and with garlands on Thy neck, well dressed, decked with jewels, Thou\nwast sleeping with K _s_ ama (forgiveness) Gopi in ease and happiness, on a\nnice bedding interspersed with flowers and well scented. Thou wert so much\nover-powered by sleep after fresh intercourse that when I went and disturbed,\nthen Thou two didst get up from the sweet sleep. I took away Thy yellow robes,\nthe beautiful Murali (flute), garlands made of forest flowers, Kaustubha gems,\nand invaluable earrings of pearls and gems. I gave it back to Thee at the\nearnest request of the S'akhis. Thy body turned black with sin and dire shame,\nK _s_ ama then quitted Her body out of shame and went down to the\n\n\n\np. 859\n\n\n\nearth. Therefore K _s_ ama turned out to be the repository of best qualities.\nOut of affection to Her, Thou didst divide Her body and distributed them\npartly to Vi _sn_ u, partly to the Vai _sn_ avas, partly to Dharma, partly to\nthe religious persons, partly to weak persons, partly to ascetics, partly to\nthe Devas, and partly to the Pundits (literary persons). O Lord! Thus I have\ndescribed Thy qualities as far as I know. What more dost thou want to hear?\nThou hast many more qualities! But I am not aware of them. Having thus spoken,\nthe red-lotus eyed Radha began to rebuke Ganga sitting by the side of S\xc2\x92ri Kri\n_sn_ a with Her head bent low out of shame. At this time Ganga, who was a\nSiddha Yogini came to know all the mysteries, and instantly disappeared from\nthe assembly in Her own water form.\n\n\n\nThe Siddha Yogini Radha came to know also, by Her Yogic power, the secrets of\nGanga and became ready to drink the whole water in one sip. Ganga, knowing\nthis intention of Radha, by Her Yogic power, took refuge of Kri _sn_ a and\nentered into His feet. Then Radha began to look out for Ganga everywhere :--\nFirst She searched in Goloka, then Vaiku _nt_ ha, then Brahma-loka; then She\nsearched all the Lokas one by one but no where did She find Ganga. All the\nplaces in Goloka became void of of water; all turned out dried mud and all the\naquatic animals died and fell to the ground. And Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, S\xc2\x92iva,\nAnanta, Dharma, Indra, Moon, Sun, Manus, Munis, Siddhas, ascetics all became\nvery thirsty and their throats became parched. They then went to Goloka, and\nbowed down with devotion to S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, Who was the Lord of all, beyond\nPrakriti, the Supreme, worthy to be worshipped, the Bestower of boons, the\nBest, and the Cause of boons; Who is the Lord of Gopas and Gopis; Who is\nformless, without any desire, unattached, without refuge, attributeless,\nwithout any enthusiasm, changeless, and unstained; Who is All Will and who\nassumes forms to show favour to His devotees; Who is Sattva, the Lord of\ntruth, the Witness and eternal Puru _s_ a and Who is the Highest, the Supreme\nLord, the Best and Excellent, the Highest Self and the Supreme God. They began\nto hymn Him. All were filled with intense feelings with devotion; tears of\nlove were flowing from their eyes and the bodies of all were filled with\necstasy, the hairs standing in ends. He was Para Brahma; His Substance was\nmade of Transcendental Light, Who is the Cause of all Causes, who was seated\nin a wonderful throne, built of invaluable gems and jewels, who was being\nfanned by the Gopas with white chowries, who was seeing and hearing with great\ndelight, and smiling countenance, the dancing and singing of the Gopis, who\nwas chewing the scented betel offered by Radha and who\n\n\n\np. 860\n\n\n\nwas residing in. the heart of His dearest S\xc2\x92ri Radha, who was the Perfect, all\npervading, and the Lord of the Rasa Circle. The Manus, Munis, and the ascetics\nall bowed down to S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, no sooner they beheld Him. Joy and wonder\nat once caught hold of their hearts. They then looked at one another and gave\nover to Brahma the task of communicating their feelings. The four faced\nBrahma, with Vi _sn_ u on His right and Vama Deva on His left, gradually came\nin front of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a. Wherever He cast His glance in the Rasa Ma _nd_\nalam, He saw S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, full of the Highest Bliss, of the nature of the\nHighest Bliss, sitting. All have turned out Kri _sn_ as; their seats were all\nuniform; all were two armed and with flutes in their hands; on every one's\nneck is the forest garland; peacock's tail was on the top of everyone's crest\nand Kaustubha jewels were on all their breasts. The Forms of all of them were\nvery beautiful; very lovely and very peaceful. No difference at all between\nthem whether in form, or in qualities, or in ornaments, or in radiance, in\nage, in lustre, in no respect no one was inferior to another. No one was\nimperfect; no one was deficient in lordliness. It was indeed very difficult to\nmake out who was the master and who was the servant. Sometimes He is seen in\nHis Teja form as the Great Light, and there is nothing else; sometimes there\nis that Clear Divine Form; sometimes He comes Formless; sometimes with form;\nand again sometimes both with and without form. Sometimes there is no Radha;\nthere is only Kri _sn_ a; And sometimes again in every seat there is the Yugal\nMurti Radha and Kri _sn_ a combined. Sometimes Radha assumes the form of Kri\n_sn_ a. So the Creator Brahma could not make out whether S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a was a\nfemale or a male. At last He meditated on S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a in his heart-lotus\nand began to chant hymns to Him with devotion and prayed for forgiveness for\nhis misdoings. When S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a got pleased, the Creator, opening His\neyes, saw S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a on the breast of S\xc2\x92ri Radha. There were His\nattendants on all the sides and the Gopis all around. Seeing this, Brahma, Vi\n_sn_ u, and Mahes'vara bowed down to Him and sang His praises.\n\n\n\n108-113. S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, the Lord of Lak _s_ mi, the Omnipresent, Cause of\nall, the Lord of all, and the Internal Ruler of all, knew their intentions\nand, addressing them, separately said :-- \xc2\x93O Brahman! Is it all well with you?\nO Lord of Kamala! Come here. O Mahadeva! Come here; let all be well to you.\nYou all have come to me for Ganga. Ganga has taken refuge under My feet out of\nfear for Radha. Seeing Ganga by My side, Radha wanted to drink Her up, However\nI\n\n\n\np. 861\n\n\n\nwill give over Ganga to the hands of you all; but you will have to pray to\nRadha, so that Ganga becomes fearless of Her.\xc2\x94 The lotus born Brahma smiled at\nS\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a's words and began to sing hymns to Radha, Who is fit to be\nworshipped by all. The Creator Brahma, the Compiler of the Four Vedas, the\nFour-faced One praised Radha with His Four heads, bent low and addressed Her\nthus :--\n\n\n\n114-125. Brahma said :-- \xc2\x93O Radhe! Ganga, appeared from Thee and the Lord S\xc2\x92ri\nKri _sn_ a. Both of you were transformed before into the liquid forms in the\nRa _s_ a Ma _nd_ alam, on hearing the music of S'ankara. And That Lquid Form\nis Ganga. So She is born of Thee and S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a. Hence She is like Thy\ndaughter and to be loved as such. She will be initiated in Thy Mantra and She\nwill worship Thee. The four armed Lord of Vaiku _nt_ ha will be Her husband.\nAnd when She will appear in parts on earth, the Salt Ocean will be Her\nhusband. O Mother! The Ganga that dwells in Goloka, is dwelling everywhere. O\nGoverness of the Devas! Thou art Her mother; and She is always Thy Self born\ndaughter.\xc2\x94 Hearing thus, the words of Brahma, Radha gave Her assent towards\nthe protection of Ganga. And then Ganga appeared from the toe-tip of S\xc2\x92ri Kri\n_sn_ a. The liquid Ganga, then, assumed Her own form and, getting up from\nwater, was received with great honour by the Devas. Bhagavan Brahma took a\nlittle of that Ganges water in His Kama _nd_ alu and Bhagavan Mahadeva kept\nsome of it in His own head.\n\n\n\nThe lotus born Brahma, then, initiated Ganga into the Radha Mantra and gave\nHer instructions, Radha Stotra (hymn of Radha) according to the Sama Veda,\nRadha Kavacha (protection mantras), Radha Dhyan (meditation on Radha), method\nof worship of Radha, and Radha's pura _s_ chara _n_ a. Ganga worshipped Radha\naccording to those instructions and went to Vaiku _nt_ ha. O Muni! Lak _s_ mi,\nSarasvati, Ganga, and the world purifying Tulasi, these four became the wives\nof Naraya _n_ a. Kri _sn_ a, then, smiled and explained to Brahma the history\nof Time, hardly to be comprehended by others. He then spoke :-- \xc2\x93O Brahma! O\nVi _sn_ u! O Mahes'vara! Now you better take Ganga and I will now tell you\nwhat a change has been effected by this time. Hear.\n\n\n\n126-136. You, the three Devas, the other Devas, Munis, Manus, Siddhas, and\nother Mahatmas that are present here, are living now. For this region of\nGoloka is not affected by Kala (Time). Now the Kalpa is going to expire. So in\nthe other regions than Goloka and Vaiku _nt_ ha, the Brahmas, etc., that were\nexisting in all other Universes, have all now dissolved in My Body. O Lotus-\nborn! Save Goloka and Vaiku _nt_ ha, all are now under water, the pre-state of\nearth. Better go and create your own\n\n\n\np. 862\n\n\n\nBrahma _nd_ as and Ganga will go to that newly created Brahma _nd_ a. I will\nalso create other worlds and the Brahmas thereof. Now you all better go with\nthe Devas and do your own works respectively. You have waited here for a long\ninterval. As many Brahmas that have fallen all appear again.\xc2\x94 Thus saying S\xc2\x92ri\nKri _sn_ a, the Lord of Radha went to His Inner Chamber. The Devas also\ninstantly retired from that spot and engaged themselves earnestly in the\ncreation work. Ganga remained as before till then in the region of Goloka,\nVaiku _nt_ ha, S\xc2\x92ivaloka, Brahma-loka, and in other places, by the command of\nS\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a. She is named Vi _sn_ upadi, because She appeared from the\nfeet of Vi _sn_ u. Thus I have described to you this pleasant, essential story\nof Ganga, leading to liberation. What more do you now want to hear? Say.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Thirteenth Chapter on the anecdote of Ganga in the Ninth Book in\nthe Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i\nVeda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 14](bk09ch14.htm)\n\n"
