Janamejaya said :-- \xc2\x93O Highly Fortunate One! Kindly narrate in detail the\nspread of the families of those kings in the Solar line who were born and who\nwere especially endowed with the knowledge of Dharma.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n2-8. Vyasa said :-- O Bharata! I now speak to you exactly what I heard of\nyore, from Narada, the best of the Ri _s_ is, how the Solar race spread. Once,\non an occasion, the Muni S'riman Narada, on his tour, came at his will to my\nholy hermitage on the beautiful banks of the Sarasvati river. On seeing him I\nbowed down at his feet and then remained standing before him. I then gave him\na seat and worshipped him with great esteem. I then said to him :-- \xc2\x93O Best of\nMunis! You are worshipped by the whole universe; my retreat is sanctified by\nyour coming. O All-knowing One! Kindly narrate the histories of the Kings that\nwere famous in the family of the seventh Manu; they were unequalled as far as\ntheir origin was concerned and their diameters as well were wonderful.\nTherefore I am very eager to know, in detail, the history of the Solar race. O\nMuni! Describe shortly or in detail as the circumstances may require.\xc2\x94 O King!\nWhen I made this question, Narada, the knower of the Highest Reality, gladly\nsmiled, and, addressing me, began to describe the history of the Solar race.\n\n\n\n9-26. Narada said :-- O son of Satyavati! The history of the royal families is\nvery holy and pleasant to hear; the more so when they are heard, one acquires\nDharma and wisdom; therefore do you hear. In ancient times, Brahma sprang from\nthe navel-lotus of Vi _sn_ u and created the\n\n\n\np. 599\n\n\n\nworld. This is well known in every Pura _n_ a. That self born, all-powerful,\nall-knowing, the Doer of all, the Universal Soul practised Tapas in ancient\ntimes for Ajuta (ten thousand) years. By virtue of that Tapas, He got special\npowers to create the world. He meditated on the Auspicious Mother, and getting\nfrom Her the excellent powers, He created first the mind-born sons, all\nendowed with auspicious signs. Of them, Marichi became well known in this act\nof creation. His son Kas'yapa was respected by all and he was of great\ncelebrity. He had thirteen wives, all daughters of Dak _s_ a Prajapati. The\nDevas, Daityas, Yak _s_ as, Pannagas, beasts and birds all sprang from him.\nTherefore this creation is called the Kas'yapi creation. Amongst the Devas,\nthe Sun is specially famous; his other name is Vivasvan. His son was named\nVaivasvat Manu; he was a famous king. Besides, Manu had nine more sons. Ik _s_\nvaku was the eldest. Their names are: (1) Nabhaga, (2) Dhrista, (3) S'aryati,\n(4)Nari _s_ yanta, (5) Prans'u, (6) Nriga, (7) Di _st_ a, (8) Karu _s_ a, and\n(9) _R_ i _s_ adhra. Ik _s_ vaku, the son of Manu was born first. He had one\nhundred sons, and Vikuk _s_ i was the wise and the eldest of these. I am now\nnarrating how the nine sons, born afterwards of Manu, spread their families.\nAmbari _s_ a was the son of Nabhaga; he was very truthful, powerful, and\nreligious. He always governed his subjects justly. Dhar _st_ aka was the son\nof Dhri _st_ a; though he was a K _s_ attriya, he attained to Brahmanhood. He\nwas naturally weak in fighting; always be was engaged in the works relating to\nthe Brahma _n_ as. \xc3\x82narta was the well known son and Sukanya was the beautiful\ndaughter of S'aryati. The King S'aryati gave his beautiful daughter in\nmarriage to the blind Chyavana Ri _s_ i; but the Ri _s_ i, though blind, got\nhis beautiful eyes again by the good character of the daughter. We heard that\nthe As'vins, the Twins, the sons of the Sun, gave him back his eyesight.\n\n\n\n27-29. Janamejaya said :-- \xc2\x93O Brahmans! How is it that the King S'aryati\nmarried his lovely-eyed daughter Sukanya to the blind Chyavana Muni? I have\ngot a great doubt on this point. The King gives his daughter in marriage to a\nblind person, if she be deformed, ill-qualified or void of female signs. But\nthe daughter, in this case, was beautiful. How then S'aryati, the Chief of\nKings, gave over his daughter, knowing that the Ri _s_ i was blind? O Brahma\n_n_ a! I am always an object of favour to you; so explain to me the cause of\nit.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n30\\. Suta said :-- Glad to hear these words of Janamejaya, the Muni Dvaipayana\nsmilingly said :--\n\n\n\n31-50. S'aryati, the son of Vaivasvata, had four thousand married wives. All\nof them were endowed with auspicious signs and beautiful\n\n\n\np. 600\n\n\n\nall of them were daughters of kings. They all were very obliging and dear to\ntheir husbands. But, out of all of these, the King had only one daughter\nexceptionally lovely and beautiful. The father and all the mothers loved\nexceedingly that sweet-smiling daughter. Not very far off the city, there was\na beautiful lake of clear waters, like the Manasarovara lake. A Ghat way\n(steps) made of stones descended into the lake. Swans Karandavas, Chakravakas,\nDatyu'has, Sarasas and other birds used to play on its waters. Five varieties\nof lotuses were there in full bloom, bees were humming there all around.\nVarious trees, S'al, Tamala, Sarala, Punnagas, As'okas, Banyans, Peepuls,\nKadambas, rows of banana trees, Jambirs, Dates, Panasas, Betelnut trees,\ncocoanut trees, Ketakas, Kanchanas, and other various beautiful trees\nencircled round the lake. Within these, the white Yuthikas, Mallikas, and\nother creepers and shrubs were seen beautifying the scenery. Especially there\nwere, amongst them, Jack trees, Mango trees, tamarind trees, Karanjas, Ku _t_\nakas, Palas'as, Neem trees, Khadiras, Bel trees, and \xc3\x82malaki trees; and\npeacocks were sounding their notes, cuckoos were cooing their beautiful\nvoices. Close to that place, there was, in a sacred grove covered over by\ntrees, staying Chyavana Muni, the Bhrigu's son, of a tranquilled mind, and the\nchief of the ascetics. Thinking the place lovely and free from any obstacles,\nthe Muni took his firm seat there and, collecting all his thoughts within\nhimself, took the vow of non-speaking and controlling his breath became\nengaged in practising tapasya. Restraining his senses and foregoing eating and\ndrinking, that Muni constantly meditated on Bhagavati of the nature of Sat,\nChit and \xc3\x82nanda, O King! While he was thus meditating, the anthill grew up\nround and covered his body and nice creepers covered that also all round. O\nKing! Long intervals passed away and it was covered over with ants; so much so\nthat that intelligent Muni was covered entirely and looked like a heap of\nearth. O King! Once the King S'aryati wanted to play in an artificial\nwilderness and came there to the lake with his wives. S'aryati became at once\ndeeply engaged in playing on the clear waters of the lake, surrounded by the\nbeautiful females. On the other hand, the quick beautiful daughter Sukanya,\npicking up flowers here and there with her companions also began to play.\nDressed in ornaments, Sukanya, walked to and fro; her anklets making a\nbeautiful tinkling sound, till she came to the ant-hill of Chyavana Ri _s_ i.\nShe sportingly sat close to that anthill and instantly saw a shining substance\ninside through that, like fireflies. \xc2\x93What is this?\xc2\x94 She thought and wishing\nto take it, took a thorn and became very eager to prick it up.\n\n\n\n51-59. Slowly she went close to it and no sooner she got ready to prick it,\nthan the Muni saw the beautiful, good-haired daughter as if to one's\n\n\n\np. 601\n\n\n\nliking. The ascetic Bhargava, seeing that auspicious nice lady with nice\nteeth, spoke out in a feeble voice :-- \xc2\x93What are you doing? O thin-bellied\nOne! I am an ascetic; better go away from here. You have got such big-eyes,\nyet you do not see me. I therefore forbid you in your this attempt; do not\npierce the anthill with thorn.\xc2\x94 Though prevented, the daughter could not hear\nhis words and asking \xc2\x93What was that?\xc2\x94 pierced his two-eyes with thorns. Thus\nimpelled by Fate, the princess sportingly pierced his eyes; but she suspected\nand thought \xc2\x93What have I done?\xc2\x94 Thus becoming afraid she returned from that\nspot. His two eyes being pricked, the great Muni exceedingly pained, became\nvery wrathful he incessantly gave vent to sorrows and remorse, being restless\nwith pain. At that instant it happened that the king, ministers, soldiers,\nelephants, horses, camels, so much so that all the beings that were there, had\nall their evacuations (passing their urines and faeces) stopped. Seeing thus\nhappened all on a sudden, the King S'aryati was very much pained and became\nvery anxious. All the soldiers came to the King and informed him of the\nstoppage of their evacuations. The King thought over the cause why this had\nhappened.\n\n\n\n60-65. Cogitating thus, the King returned home. Becoming very much troubled\nwith cares and anxieties, He asked his soldiers and kinsmen \xc2\x93Who amongst you\nhas done such an heinous act? On the west side of the lake the Mahar _s_ i\nChyavana is practising the great tapasya in the midst of the forest; I think\nsomeone has done mischief to that king of ascetics, blazing like a fire; and\ntherefore we are overcome with this disease. The highsouled aged son of Bhrigu\nhas become specially proficient in his asceticism and has become supreme; I\nthink someone must have injured him. Though I do not know who is that\nmischievous person that has shown him contempt or like that, this our state at\npresent clearly shews that this is the fit punishment of that.\xc2\x94 Hearing this,\nthe soldiers said :-- None of us has committed any mischief by word, mind or\nbody; we know this very well.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Second Chapter of the Seventh Book on the piercing of the eyes\nof Chyavana Muni in S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam the Maha Pura _n_ am, of 18,000\nverses, Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 3](bk07ch03.htm)\n\n"
