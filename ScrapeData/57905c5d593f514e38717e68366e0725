It is a shame to call those teachers who\nare hired.\n\n701\n\nWhatever orpiment may be, there is not the least tin in it, though the three\n(powder, tin and lead) be found, it is not attached to them; but in the\nflaming fire is tin produced.\n\np. 172\n\n702\n\nHe smiles, he reads, he sings, whatever he do he is not pained, but pleased\nwith all and at one time will forget all. He is young, he becomes old.\nConsider who this is.\n\n703\n\nIf the water exudes and stands, mud is produced; but when thick rain pours, it\nwill not remain. Reveal not this path but know it well (thus does sloth reduce\nmen to sensuality).\n\n704\n\nThe water shows the might of a ship; the plain shows the power of a car; but\nthe power of a woman is seen [wherever](errata.htm#119) she be.\n\n705\n\nWho am I to think in any mind or who am I to be without meditation; alas the\ndeity appears to man, and conceals itself.\n\n706\n\np. 173\n\nThe great family being thus extensive, is it a wise practice to think so much\nof the tribes of the various rishis? Can a monkey of the woods govern the\nworld?\n\n707\n\nHe who desires not milk, water, ghee, boiled rice, women--this is steadfast\nsoul. He shall not fail in a single point nor walk in another path.\n\n708\n\nThe swan knows water from milk, but how should the peacock know it. Then can a\nbrute beast know God?\n\n709\n\nHe will bestow on the vile and the jesters; he will give it for a _pariar_ ,\nskin, the son of a _pariar_ ; or to the drab of a fair, he bestows not on the\nexcellent.\n\n710\n\nThey know merely the teaching of the ancients, they have not the smallest\nsense; they gain nothing but wrangling; sad work like a thief who has no\npleasure in moon light.\n\n711\n\np. 174\n\nThey talk as if life were eternal and pride themselves greatly, the fools. All\nbeings are as sheep bound for sacrifice before Yama.\n\n712\n\nThe divines call divinity; if thou consider well, it is with thee already; but\nthey cannot see the form that is before them.\n\n713\n\nIn their mind they cannot discern the form of God. Those who can view it in\ntheir mind exist not in the earth; but he who searcheth in his body and\nrecognizeth it with delight in him, is the noblest of _yogees_.\n\n714\n\nThe mind is the fire that produces both good and evil; surely then let us know\nits greatness and its meanness in the closing and opening of an eye; does the\nmind roam afar is not this evident?\n\n715\n\nBorn from coition were all men and thus they long for it; without hindrance\nall haste to that by which they were produced.\n\np. 175\n\n716\n\nIf life have passed away for even half an hour, hath even Brahma himself power\nto vivify him? Hath Brahma then power either to slay or cause to live?\n\n717\n\nThese words of discrimination, thus spoken by Vemadu. This insane conduct of\nVema proves to be adverse to all fools. But to the wise, they are felicity.\n\n718\n\nKnowing that this book is a means of attaining both this and that world, they\nwho write. read, hear this, it shall slay by its might the acts they have\nhitherto or (during life) done, it is even for others the path to beatitude.\n\n719\n\nThis is not such learning as are the _Vedas_. This is not the language of a\nhero (such as the Ramayana). This is no painful knowledge. It is no great\nthing. This is that sweet knowledge that stays the mind. That is fragrant\nwhich is soon learnt (for sv\xc4\x81du some read s\xc4\x81dhu, here and in the next verse).\n\np. 177\n\n720\n\nHe who goes on saying I will give to you; but whenever you come to him puts\noff the time; the slaves that merely make false promises be they hanged in a\nnoose.\n\n721\n\nThe verses of Vemana may be interpreted in a thousand ways if thou closely\nconsider them. By reading and again reading then thou shalt attain curious\nwisdom.\n\n722\n\nAll those excellent ones who have read with sound sense a verse uttered by\nVemana, these shall be exalted to dwell on the head of Siva (Somu); let then\nwith thorough consent study them with wisdom.\n\n723\n\nTo consider omens and all circumstances with interest, regarding a marriage\nwith the daughter of a maternal uncle--It is all one sea that you enter.\n\np. 177\n\n724\n\nIf both parties are in poverty, let them by as much money as seems requisite,\nprepare a vessel of rice, and give the bride. Eat not the bread of prostitute.\n\n725\n\nWhat thou it be son-in-law or no connection, we have set forth the proper\nrules; not even a leaf trembles unknown to god.\n\n726\n\nThough thou are poor, if thou say to a man, I will give thee my daughter, ask\nnot for gold with harshness; to accept gold from him is vile as if you were to\ntake your own daughter.\n\n727\n\nThe boundary of the village appears to no one (y\xc4\x93riki for evariki); it is\nearth not again apparent void of mark, it cannot again be found; consumption\n(or tenanting it) is the only sure boundary which does not depend upon stones.\n\np. 178\n\n728\n\nThe kings and princes who trusted the boundary stones have left their food,\nfallen and perished in the earth. The sons of demons who destroy these stones\nretain their villages and estates, and live there. (This is evidently aired at\nthe Mahommedan government--estate is here mahal, the Persian word).\n\n729\n\nThat possession that we have held for three generations without paying a sean\nas homage, the usufruct we enjoy is our strength. No other means, however\nnumerous, are of any avail.\n\n730\n\nThe writing, the possession and the evidence--in these three rests secure\nenjoyment of long duration; even in the courts of heaven they say these three\nhave great weight (easy, pure sanscrit).\n\n731\n\nIf the objections be good that disturb your ancient enjoyment of property, the\nwritings are the basis of all, and set aside the old tenant, if his right be\nnot good.\n\np. 179\n\n732\n\n[You](errata.htm#120) may speak a hundred words but beware of\n[writing](errata.htm#121) down one. No evidence is required if the writing is\nproduced. But in case writing is wanted then indeed good witnesses are\nrequired. (easy, pure Telugu),\n\n733\n\nWhen both the writing and enjoyment are combined, then is the evidence sure.\nWhen the writing and enjoyment are both wanting all other evidence\n[is](errata.htm#122) fruitless.\n\n734\n\nIf along with the first witness an [opposing](errata.htm#123) witness be\nadduced, the preceding [witness](errata.htm#124) is of avail. The latter\nwitness is the source of in influence. (lit. power.)\n\n735\n\nNo authority (lit. great men) will accept of a (metca) sole witness, though he\nspeak. no one will lend him an ear. If Item be two witnesses we may hold it\ntrue. A respectable house holder is the only witness.\n\np. 180\n\n736\n\nWhen a great combat for a boundary begins, rather than killing each other in\nthe dispute let old farmers who know the origin walk the path of the boundary.\n(Disputed boundaries are thus settled by an experienced farmer being\n[appointed](errata.htm#125) to walk on the correct line of path demarcation).\n\n737\n\nIf one regard not right and wrong, and in any degree void of foresight, change\nthe boundary path, desiring the worthless stones, and have them removed, and\nput his foot there (to establish another path), sin attaches to him.\n\n738\n\nIt is [fit](errata.htm#126) to put diverse marks off the fixed boundary\nstones, foreseeing evil. Walk with a view to the [present](errata.htm#127) and\nthe [coming](errata.htm#128) world. The next world is known to thee O Vema!\n\n739\n\nIf you perform the ceremonies of donation (by pouring water into the hand),\nand provide copper tablets, connect them with a thick ring and on the joining\nof the ring the royal seal be affixed, this forms a sasanam (charter) in the\nearth.\n\np. 181\n\n740\n\nAt an (hour when all the people of the village come along with him, with\nappropriate observances with a drawn sword, let him walk separately and lay\ndown the land mark with care.\n\n741\n\nBehind the man [while](errata.htm#129) he is digging the boundary, let the\nopposite dig an opposite bound and let all the chief men give him their\nblessings.\n\n742\n\nLet a farmer who is void of even the least deceit quickly and without timidity\nwalk on the track of his feet, and let the good and chief men who know the\nfact also walk it.\n\n743\n\nThe (jewel of calculators) good accountant who takes a pole thirty two feet\nlong, places it and measures it; let him receive the blessings of the people\nand live in virtue.\n\np. 182\n\n744\n\nThe writing of the excellent man [who](errata.htm#130) measures the land\nleaving on each side of the measuring pole six steps as long as a cow's foot\nsteps (unapportioned to either), that writing will be stable and able to reply\neven to the writing of fate.\n\n745\n\nThose men who cause the land to be measured (colva cheyu) with arithmetical\nstandard of the pole and the rod and with skill know to supportion the\ncompensation of the foot (measure of a bow's foot allowed on each side as\nverse 744). These are arithmeticians.\n\n746\n\nThe use of having eyes is that he may know the quality of the field and the\nfitness of the tenant. If when he measureth, he regard not the rules of\ncalculation, but does it hastily in the space of a twinkling of the eye, he\nshall depart void of male offspring.\n\n747\n\nHe who knows the due shares of the crop and the fruitfulness of the lands,\nwell versed in equity, suitable council\n\np. 183\n\n[paragraph continues] (lit. contrivance), who knows the due\n[division](errata.htm#131) of shares pertaining to the government and the\nfarmer, and on his guard against sin (injustice), he who knows also how to\nwrite all his is the chief (lit. jewel) of men.\n\n748\n\nThe measurements of tanks and ponds, the measurement used in fields and small\nplots the measurement along boundaries without hindrance--to know the rules\nfor these is a victory.\n\n[749](errata.htm#132)\n\nAll those debased ones, who not recognising equity, measure the earth with a\npole and over-reach in the measurement--these shall in the transmigration be\nborn as leeches (the irregular floundering pace of which resembles their\ncareless measurement.)\n\n750\n\nParched fields, dry without rain, if excessive rain fall, are destroyed. He\nwho looks to his crop expecting crop upon crop, a luckless wretch is he\nwherever he be.\n\n751\n\np. 184\n\nThey who are distinguished (or humble) in instruction, in recluseness, (not\nexact means) and devotion, and those who are no evil doers (mischievous) but\nunited to wisdom--the verses that Vemana has nobly written are numerous by the\nnumber of thousands, beyond the power even of these men to write. (a\nsingularly complicate verse).\n\n752\n\nA woman who gives no food or drink is no true wife to her husband. She is\nrather his destiny. The husband who is united with such a woman perishes\nwithout the chance of being born again. He will perish degraded and become a\nreptile.\n\n753\n\nComposed of desire and cupidity, and of stubborn hearts are women. What can we\nsay of the conduct of women? Faithfulness is their chief virtue. They are in\nother respects mere figs--fair without but worms within.\n\n754\n\nWomen perform (pettu) sraddha (funeral rites) to women; what witness is there\nin women to do this. Then performing (iduta) it to women, better it performed\nto stones!\n\np. 185\n\n755\n\nBy the anniversary ceremonies the whole caste is ruined; by the conduct of\nwomen all respectability (shame) is destroyed; by ponds that are spoiled this\nworld is; destroyed (good water being thus wasted) and life is ruined by\nslanders.\n\n756\n\nWhen a woman is called to attend a funeral, the funeral is a (useless) ruined\nfuneral. Males alone can be the performers or guests herein (carta, bhocta).\n\n757\n\nTo the funeral feasts of widows, why instead of inviting widows, why do they\ninvite Brahmins; to the funeral of a married woman ye invite married wives.\n\n758\n\nIf thou give the funeral feast to widows, void of means, they would rejoice,\nin every one of thy acts; but through thy neglecting this, thy former acts in\na preceding birth become hateful in this world of earth, sky and air ( _i.e._\n, void of favour before men, gods and demigods).\n\np. 186\n\n759\n\nSearching, searching and searching, fretting (or being fatigued) and fretting,\nwandering, wandering and wandering till your head turns giddy. I saw that it\nis like beholding a puppet show.\n\n760\n\nThose that bear (see) us and those we bear (or see),knowing their deaths are\nat hand, and knowing our own, delusion suffers us not to know this. But her\nhouse deserted!\n\n761\n\nThough he read all [that](errata.htm#133) can be read and attain ample\ndiscrimination but how shall the hypocrite (consider) attain beatitude--like\nas the wandering wishes of a dog though lying at ease on the hearth.\n\n762\n\nIf you seat a dog in a royal sedan, it cannot remain fixed in one mind. Thus\ncannot the man of ignorant mind restrain his soul.\n\n763\n\np. 187\n\nBorn on the earth, growing up in earth how shall a man quit the earth and\nattain heaven. The bliss of heaven does not exist in this earth.\n\n764\n\nWhat has the sage to do with rites? The sage [requires](errata.htm#134) no\nconcealment; if the excellent man possesses [undefiled](errata.htm#135) wisdom\nhe shall in this earth attain deliverance from all earthly ties.\n\n765\n\nHe who offering erroneous prayers for wealth attain good works, through that\nwealth shall not attain honour. By honouring a teacher, he shall comprehend\nthe greatness of the divine glory, and shine for .ever. (a loose version)\n\n766\n\nTo be subject to (joined with) desire and avarice is a great grief. He that\nquits desire is the perfect man. If avarice leave thee thou shalt know the\nbliss of the next world.\n\n767\n\nLike him who, knowing the suitability of stones uniteth stones into a binding;\nif like him, thou know the desirable arrangement of thy mind and thus order\nthy mind--hereby shalt thou know the divinity and\n[thenceforth](errata.htm#136) live in happiness.\n\np. 188\n\n768\n\nBearing a load of (a toom full of) _jonna_ a stupid bullock still wears a bell\nproudly on its neck; while it wears a bell and serves, blows follow it.\n\n769\n\nThe excellence of him that is united with the deity is known to himself alone.\nHow can others comprehend it? If he be himself become the God why should he\nworship him?\n\n770\n\nIn the worship of God, in the temples, he showed us a path saying. There is\nthe God. If ye understood it, this entire world is that deity which is origin\nof all the Gods.\n\n771\n\nAll virtue combined became man, and he was produced; all sin combined, and\nwoman (fiend) was born. Knowing woman to be evil, yet when ye see her ye fear\nto abhor her.\n\n772\n\nIf a whore, faithful, comes perpetually she is not faithful but death. If\ndeath enters your house, will she not devour you?\n\np. 189\n\n773\n\nIf you do not put a basketful of bran before it, the she\n[buffalo](errata.htm#137) you have bought will not let you milk. He can you\nvainly love a dancing girl?\n\n774\n\nWhat does the arrogant high way man know of (care for poverty? As you call out\nfor mercy he merely breaks your head) What does the young prostitute care\nabout considering virtues of the [faithful](errata.htm#138) wife?\n\n775\n\nA house without a liberal man is a great demon street; a word void of wisdom\nis a blow with a stone; a loveless whore is a murderess.\n\n776\n\nHe that says not thus large are her eyes, thus large her breasts, and who\nshines not thus entangled doth not desert devotion--this is the permanent\nsage.\n\n777\n\np. 190\n\nThis body is a leathern puppet with joints--a vessel full of lies. A shiftless\nwhore, an entangled car--who can describe its abominations.\n\n778\n\nWe must of necessity ramble as far as the mind rambles and must turn when the\nmind turns. He that roams and rambles--he seems as a God.\n\n779\n\nThis is not a tattered cloth, says the recluse, but a fair vest; this is not a\nfoul body but beatitude. Behold and wander at the greatness of him who is\ndevoted to the Supreme.\n\n780\n\nHappy is he who without considering this or that place,\n[everywhere](errata.htm#139) dwells as Siva. To them of understanding he\nappears as a God.\n\n781\n\nTaking the flesh as a covering does the deceived creature devour flesh, If he\nwere released from the flesh could he speak?\n\np. 191\n\n782\n\nThe talker shall in one way or another perish surely, the wise shall alone be\nhappy and glorious in the earth; let disputes be ceased from and thus shall\nthe yogee attain overwhelming ecstasy and thus gain perfection. (very hard)\n\n783\n\nWho are those that hear of or have seen the deity. Those who have heard of him\nalone see him. Gaze steadily on him whether in the form of ocean or any other.\n\n784\n\nIgnorant that the deity shines abroad in the earth, why should ye search\nimagining him elsewhere? That the deity exists within thee is truth.\n\n785\n\nSurely void of the creator exists not the creation The creator formed it\ndiversely. Look to that external world. Look to that eternal world that is\nwithout creator.\n\n786\n\np. 192\n\nHe that perceiveth not him shall never become him. He who is in them is His.\nHe that hath seen Him is himself the _yogee_.\n\n787\n\nSeeing the love of women sages (sanyasees) will love them,\n[being](errata.htm#140) immersed in the infamy of the world; when it has\ncaught a bird, the cat is happy.\n\n788\n\nWhat does the dog know of the linga priests, God? What does the fox know of\none meal a day and fasting? What does the obstinate fool know of the path of\nbeatitude.\n\n789\n\nA pot without a bottom is unprofitable, a devotee without strength of body is\nuseless. He has become like a shaven widow woman alas, alas.\n\n790\n\nIt would be amazing if the ocean of six thousand paths should ever be so\nstirred up as to turn sweet. Though you should teach the knowledge of God in a\nthousand ways to a piece of wood, it would be vain, O Vema.\n\np. 193\n\n791\n\nThough they search, they cannot discover that one God who alone is skilled in\nthe scriptures; but the excellent man perceives Him in the earth. Him who is\nand is not, they cannot behold.\n\n792\n\nIgnorant of the true nature of inferiority and superiority, through desire ye\nperform salutations. Who is the honoured, which is the worshipper? What\nintrinsic difference exists?\n\n793\n\nIf they see a sage, they who are bound in the ties of this world simply call\nhim mad. They cannot quit their nature. If a fool should in this earth seek\nnature, shall he find it?\n\n794\n\nMen devoid of wisdom are indeed multitudinous, but though thou examine no man\nof wisdom is to be perceived. Through the deceptions of nature we cannot\nperceive the divinity.\n\n795\n\np. 194\n\nWhen a plan is devised, unless it be performed, the hire is not given. Unless\nshe [satisfy](errata.htm#141) your desire you would not give her a shilling.\nThus is the teacher that bestows no beatitude is a son of apes!\n\n796\n\nWhen a pararamour takes one, is disgusted and leaves her; then (or\nafterwards), another takes and loves her. Will not dogs lick the leaf-plate\nthat is tossed away after eating.\n\n797\n\nWhen we see a girl and exclaim how large are her eyes and how fair her\nbreasts, the mind is deluded and falls in love, unable to perceive Him who\ndwells within our mortal frame.\n\n798\n\nHe who through an airy nature falls in love is even ensnared by a girl with\nsunken eyes. He is born, lives, and again is born ceaselessly.\n\n799\n\nGrowing by sucking the breast, he falls in love with the breast. By her\nbreast, beatitude becomes insipid. He who will lave the breast is a saint\nforever.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 800-899](vov10.htm)\n\n"
