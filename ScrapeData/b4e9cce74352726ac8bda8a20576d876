III.\n\nThree different kinds of dissolution. Duration of a Pararddha. The Clepsydra,\nor vessel for measuring time. The dissolution that occurs at the end of a day\nof Brahma.\n\nTHE dissolution of existing beings is of three kinds, incidental, elemental,\nand absolute 1. The incidental is that which relates to Brahma, and occurs at\nthe end of a Kalpa: the elemental is that which takes place after two\nPararddhas: the absolute is final liberation from existence.\n\nMAITREYA.--Tell me, excellent master, what is the enumeration of a Pararddha,\nthe expiration of two of which is the period of elemental dissolution 2.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--A Pararddha, Maitreya, is that number which occurs in the\neighteenth place of figures, enumerated according to the rule of decimal\nnotation 3. At the end of twice that period elemental dissolution\n\np. 631\n\noccurs, when all the discrete products of nature are withdrawn into their\nindiscrete source. The shortest period of time is a Matra, which is equal to\nthe twinkling of the human eye. Fifteen Matras make a Kasht\xcc\x81ha; thirty\nKasht\xcc\x81has, one Kala; fifteen Kalas, one Nad\xcc\x81ika. A Nad\xcc\x81ika is ascertained by a\nmeasure of water, with a vessel made of twelve Palas and a half of copper, in\nthe bottom of which there is to be a hole made with a tube of gold, of the\nweight of four Mashas, and four inches long 4. According to the Magadha\nmeasure, the vessel should hold a Prastha (or sixteen Palas) of water. Two of\nthese Nad\xcc\x81is make one Muhurtta; thirty of which are one day and night. Thirty\nsuch periods form a month; twelve months make a year, or a day and night of\nthe gods; and three hundred and sixty such days constitute a year of the\ncelestials. An aggregate of four ages contains twelve thousand divine years;\nand a thousand periods of four ages complete a day of Brahma. That period is\nalso termed a Kalpa, during which fourteen Manus preside; and at the end of it\noccurs the incidental or Brahma dissolution. The nature of this dissolution is\nvery fearful: hear me describe it, as well as that which takes place at the\nelemental dissolution, which I will also relate to you.\n\nAt the end of a thousand periods of four ages the earth is for the most part\nexhausted. A total dearth then ensues, which lasts a hundred\n\np. 632\n\nyears; and, in consequence of the failure of food, all beings become languid\nand exanimate, and at last entirely perish. The eternal Vishn\xcc\x81u then assumes\nthe character of Rudra, the destroyer, and descends to reunite all his\ncreatures with himself. He enters into the seven rays of the sun 5, drinks up\nall the waters of the globe, and causes all moisture whatever, in living\nbodies or in the soil, to evaporate; thus drying up the whole earth. The seas,\nthe rivers, the mountain torrents, and springs, are all exhaled; and so are\nall the waters of Patala, the regions below the earth. Thus fed, through his\nintervention, with abundant moisture, the seven solar rays dilate to seven\nsuns 6, whose radiance glows above, below, and on every side, and sets the\nthree worlds and Patala on fire. The three worlds, consumed by these suns,\nbecome rugged and deformed throughout the whole extent of their mountains,\nrivers, and seas; and the earth, bare of verdure, and destitute of moisture,\nalone remains, resembling in appearance the back of a tortoise. The destroyer\nof all things, Hari, in the form of Rudra, who is the flame of time, becomes\nthe scorching breath of the serpent \xc5\x9aesha, and thereby reduces Patala to\nashes. The great fire, when it has burnt all the divisions of Patala, proceeds\nto the earth, and consumes it also. A vast whirlpool of eddying flame then\nspreads to the region of the atmosphere, and the sphere of the gods, and wraps\nthem in ruin. The three spheres shew like a frying-pan amidst the surrounding\nflames, that prey upon all moveable or stationary things. The inhabitants of\nthe two upper spheres, having discharged their functions, and being annoyed by\nthe heat, remove to the sphere above, or Maharloka. When that becomes heated,\nits tenants, who after the full period of their stay are desirous of ascending\nto higher regions, depart for the Janaloka 7.\n\np. 633\n\nJanarddana, in the person of Rudra, having consumed the whole world, breathes\nforth heavy clouds; and those called Samvartta, resembling vast elephants in\nbulk, overspread the sky, roaring, and darting lightnings. Some are as black\nas the blue lotus; some are white as the water-lily; some are dusky, like\nsmoke; and some are yellow; some are of a dun colour, like that of an ass;\nsome like ashes sprinkled on the forehead; some are deep blue, as the lapis\nlazuli; some azure, like the sapphire; some are white, as the conch or the\njasmine; and some are black, as collyrium; some are of bright red, like the\nladybird; some are of the fierceness of red arsenic; and some are like the\nwing of the painted jay. Such are these massy clouds in hue: in form some\nresemble towns, some mountains, some are like houses and hovels, and some are\nlike columns. Mighty in size, and loud in thunder, they fill all space.\nShowering down torrents of water, these clouds quench the dreadful fires which\ninvolve the three worlds, and then they rain uninterruptedly for a hundred\nyears, and deluge the whole world. Pouring down in drops as large as dice,\nthese rains overspread the earth, and fill the middle region, and inundate\nheaven. The world is now enveloped in darkness, and all things, animate or\ninanimate, having perished, the clouds continue to pour down their waters for\nmore than a hundred years.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[630:1](vp158.htm#fr_1612) The first is called Naimittaka, 'occasional' or\n'incidental,' or Brahmya, as occasioned by the intervals of Brahma's days; the\ndestruction of creatures, though not of the substance of the world, occurring\nduring his night. The general resolution of the elements into their primitive\nsource, or Prakriti, is the Prakritika destruction, and occurs at the end of\nBrahma's life. The third, the absolute or final, \xc3\x81tyantika, is individual\nannihilation; Moksha, exemption for ever from future existence. The Bhagavata\nhere notices the fourth kind, of which mention occurred in a preceding passage\n([p. 56](vp041.htm#page_56)), Nitya or constant dissolution; explaining it to\nbe the imperceptible change that all things suffer in the various stages of\ngrowth and decay, life and death. 'The various conditions of beings subject to\nchange are occasioned by that constant dissolution of life which is rapidly\nproduced by the resistless stream of time, taking every thing perpetually\naway.' The Vayu describes but three kinds of Pralaya, omitting the Nitya.\n\n[630:2](vp158.htm#fr_1613) Maitreya has a rather indifferent memory (see [p.\n22](vp037.htm#page_22)); but the periods specified in the two places do not\nagree. In the first book two Pararddhas, as equal to one hundred years of\nBrahma, are 311.040.000.000.000 years of mortals.\n\n[630:3](vp158.htm#fr_1614) Counting according to this mode of enumeration, a\nPararddha is represented by 100.000.000.000.000.000. The Vayu Puran\xcc\x81a has a\nterm for each of these decimal values. Da\xc5\x9ba, 10; \xc5\x9aatam, 100; Sahasram, 1000;\nAyutam, 10.000; Niyutam, 100.000; Prayutam, 1.000.000; Arvudam, 10.000.000;\nNyurvudam, p. 631 100.000.000; Vrindam, 1.000.000.000; Param, 10.000.000.000;\nKharvam, 100.000.000.000; Nikharvam, 1000.000.000.000; \xc5\x9aankham,\n10.000.000.000.000; Padmam, 100.000.000.000.000; Samudram, 1.000.000.000.000;\nMadhyamam, 10.000.000.000.000.000; Pararddham, 100.000.000.000.000.000. In the\nfirst book the Pararddham, as the half of Brahma's life, is but\n155.520.000.000.000, fifteen instead of eighteen places of figures.\n\n[631:4](vp158.htm#fr_1615) The description of the Clepsydra is very brief, and\nwanting in precision. One of the commentaries is more explicit: 'A vessel made\nof twelve Palas and a half of copper, and holding a Prastha, Magadha measure,\nof water, broad at top, and having at bottom a tube of gold of four Mashas\nweight, four fingers long, is placed in water, and the time in which the\nvessel is filled by the hole in the bottom is called a Nad\xcc\x81ika:' The term\n\xc5\x9aalaka generally means a needle or stake, but it must here denote a pipe. The\ncommon measure of the Nad\xcc\x81i is a thin shallow brass cup, with a small hole in\nthe bottom. It is placed on the surface of water, in a large vessel, where\nnothing can disturb it, and where the water gradually fills the cup, and sinks\nit. As. Res, vol. V. p. 87.\n\n[632:5](vp158.htm#fr_1616) See [p. 236](vp069.htm#page_236). n.\n[3](vp069.htm#fn_717).\n\n[632:6](vp158.htm#fr_1617) These also have their several appellations: the\ncommentator quotes the Vedas as the authority: \xc3\x81raga, Bhraja, Pat\xcc\x81ala,\nPatanga, Swamabhak, Jyotishmat, and Savibhasa.\n\n[632:7](vp158.htm#fr_1618) The passage may also be understood, 'Those go to\nJanaloka who are desirous of obtaining Brahma, or final liberation, through\nthe ten stages of perfection--devotion, penance, truth, &c.' In the Vayu\nPuran\xcc\x81a more details are specified. Those sainted mortals who have diligently\nworshipped Vishn\xcc\x81u, and are distinguished for piety, abide, at the time of\ndissolution, in Maharloka, with the Pitris, the Manus, p. 633 the seven\nRishis, the various orders of celestial spirits, and the gods. These, when the\nheat of the flames that destroy the world reaches to Maharloka, repair to\nJanaloka in their subtile forms, destined to become reembodied, in similar\ncapacities as their former, when the world is renewed, at the beginning of the\nsucceeding Kalpa. This continues throughout the life of Brahma; at the\nexpiration of his life all are destroyed: but those who have then attained a\nresidence in the Brahmaloka, by having identified themselves in spirit with\nthe supreme, are finally resolved into the sole-existing Brahma.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter IV](vp159.htm)\n\n"
