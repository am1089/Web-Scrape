He extends (these verses) by (interpolating) the sound 4. Verily, breath\n(pra _n_ a) is sound. Therefore every breath when it sounds, sounds loud, as\nit were.\n\n2\\. The verse (VIII, 69, 2) nada _m_ va odatinam, &c., is by its syllables an\nUsh _n_ ih 5, by its feet an Anush _t_ ubh 6. Ush _n_ ih is life, Anush _t_\nubh, speech. He thus places life and speech in him (the sacrificer.)\n\n3\\. By repeating the first verse three times, they\n\np. 185\n\nbecome twenty-five. The trunk is the twenty-fifth, and Pra _g_ apati is the\ntwenty-fifth. There are ten fingers on his hands, ten toes on his feet, two\nlegs, two arms, and the trunk the twenty-fifth. He adorns that trunk as the\ntwenty-fifth. Now this day consists of twenty-five, and the Stoma hymn of that\nday consists of twenty-five: it becomes the same through the same. Therefore\nthe two, the day and the hymn, are twenty-five. This is the twenty-fifth with\nregard to the body.\n\n4\\. Next, with regard to the deities: The eye, the ear, the mind, speech, and\nbreath, these five deities (powers) have entered into that person (purusha),\nand that person entered into the five deities. He is wholly pervaded there\nwith his limbs to the very hairs and nails. Therefore all beings to the very\ninsects are born as pervaded (by the deities or senses) 1.\n\n5\\. This has been declared by a _Ri_ shi (Rv. X, 4, 8):--\n\n6\\. 'A thousandfold are these fifteen hymns;'--for five arise from ten 2.\n\n7\\. 'As large as heaven and earth, so large is it;'--verily, the self ( _g_\nivatman) is as large as heaven and earth.\n\n8\\. 'A thousandfold are the thousand powers 3;'--\n\np. 186\n\nby saying this the poet pleases the hymns (the senses), and magnifies them.\n\n9\\. 'As far as Brahman reaches, so far reaches speech;'--wherever there is\nBrahman, there is a word; and wherever there is a word, there is Brahman, this\nwas intended.\n\n10\\. The first of the hymns among all those hymns has nine verses. Verily,\nthere are nine pra _n_ as (openings), and it serves for their benefit.\n\n11\\. Then follows a hymn of six verses. Verily, the seasons are six, and it\nserves to obtain them.\n\n12\\. Then follows a hymn of five verses. Verily' the Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti consists of five\nfeet. Verily, Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti is food, and it serves for the gaining of proper food.\n\n13\\. Then follows a tristich. Three are these threefold worlds, and it serves\nto conquer them.\n\n14\\. These verses become B _ri_ hatis 1, that metre being immortal, leading to\nthe world of the Devas. That body of verses is the trunk (of the bird\nrepresented by the whole _s_ astra), and thus it is. He who knows this comes\nby this way (by making the verses the trunk of the bird) near to the immortal\nSelf, yea, to the immortal Self 2.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[184:4](sbe01195.htm#fr_454) Cf. I, 3, 5, 1.\n\n[184:5](sbe01195.htm#fr_455) Each pada has seven syllables, the third only\nsix; but a seventh syllable is gained by pronouncing the y as i. Comm.\n\n[184:6](sbe01195.htm#fr_456) Because it has four padas.\n\n[185:1](sbe01195.htm#fr_457) The commentator takes this in a different sense,\nexplaining atra, there, as the body pervaded by the person, yet afterwards\nstating that all beings are born, pervaded by the senses.\n\n[185:2](sbe01195.htm#fr_458) The commentator explains uktha, hymns, as members\nor organs. They are the five, and they spring from the ten, i. e. from the\nfive elements (earth, water, fire, wind, and ether), forming part of the\nfather and mother each, and therefore called ten, or a decade. Da _s_ ata _h_\nis explained by bhutada _s_ akat.\n\n[185:3](sbe01195.htm#fr_459) The application of the senses to a thousand\ndifferent objects.\n\n[186:1](sbe01195.htm#fr_460) Each foot of the Trish _t_ ubh has eleven\nsyllables, to which seven are added from the Nada hymn. This gives eighteen\nsyllables for each pada. Two padas therefore give thirty-six syllables, and\nthis is a B _ri_ hati. In this manner the twenty-three verses of the hymns\nyield forty-six B _ri_ hatis. Comm.\n\n[186:2](sbe01195.htm#fr_461) He obtains a birth among the gods by means of\nthis Mahavrata ceremonial, if performed with meditation and a right\nunderstanding of its hidden meaning.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4, 1](sbe01196.htm)\n\n"
