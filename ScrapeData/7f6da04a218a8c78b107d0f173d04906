Sita tells Hanuman\nagain to convey her message to Rama and bid him hasten to rescue her. Hanuman\nreplies as before that there is no one on earth equal to Rama, who will soon\ncome and destroy Ravan. There is not a new idea in the two Cantos: all is\nreiteration.\n\n[417:2](ry379.htm#fr_877) The expedients to vanquish an enemy or to make him\ncome to terms are said to be four: conciliation, gifts, disunion, and force or\npunishment. Hanuman considers it useless to employ the first three and\nresolves to punish Ravan by destroying his pleasure-grounds.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XLII.: The Giants Roused.](ry380.htm)\n\n"
