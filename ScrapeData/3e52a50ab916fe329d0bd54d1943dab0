(The initial statement is made) because (the highest Self) exists in the\ncondition (of the individual soul); so Ka _s_ ak _ri_ tsna thinks.\n\nBecause the highest Self exists also in the condition of the individual soul,\ntherefore, the teacher Ka _s_ ak _ri_ tsna thinks, the initial statement which\naims at intimating the non-difference of the two is possible. That the highest\nSelf only is that which appears as the individual soul, is evident from the\nBrahma _n_ a-passage, 'Let me enter into them with this living Self and evolve\nnames and forms,' and similar passages. We have also mantras to the same\neffect, for instance, 'The wise one who, having produced all forms and made\nall names, sits calling the things by their names' (Taitt. \xc3\x82r. III, 12, 7) 2.\n\np. 279\n\n[paragraph continues] And where Scripture relates the creation of fire and the\nother elements, it does not at the same time relate a separate creation of the\nindividual soul; we have therefore no right to look on the soul as a product\nof the highest Self, different from the latter.--In the opinion of the teacher\nKa _s_ ak _ri_ tsna the non-modified highest Lord himself is the individual\nsoul, not anything else. \xc3\x82 _s_ marathya, although meaning to say that the soul\nis not (absolutely) different from the highest Self, yet intimates by the\nexpression, 'On account of the fulfilment of the promise'--which declares a\ncertain mutual dependence--that there does exist a certain relation of cause\nand effect between the highest Self and the individual soul 1. The opinion of\nAu _d_ ulomi again clearly implies that the difference and non-difference of\nthe two depend on difference of condition 2. Of these three opinions we\nconclude that the one held by Ka _s_ ak _ri_ tsna accords with Scripture,\nbecause it agrees with what all the Vedanta-texts (so, for instance, the\npassage, 'That art thou') aim at inculcating. Only on the opinion of Ka _s_ ak\n_ri_ tsna immortality can be viewed as the result of the knowledge of the\nsoul; while it would be impossible to hold the same view if the soul were a\nmodification (product) of the Self and as such liable to lose its existence by\nbeing merged in its causal substance. For the same reason, name and form\ncannot abide in the soul (as was above attempted to prove by means of the\nsimile of the rivers), but abide in the limiting adjunct and are ascribed to\nthe soul itself in a figurative sense only. For the same reason the origin of\nthe souls from the highest Self, of which Scripture speaks in some places as\nanalogous to the issuing of sparks from the fire, must be viewed as based only\non the limiting adjuncts of the soul.\n\nThe last three Sutras have further to be interpreted so as to furnish replies\nto the second of the purvapakshin's arguments, viz. that the B _ri_ hadara _n_\nyaka passage represents as\n\np. 280\n\nthe object of sight the individual soul, because it declares that the great\nBeing which is to be seen arises from out of these elements. 'There is an\nindication of the fulfilment of the promise; so \xc3\x82 _s_ marathya thinks.' The\npromise is made in the two passages, 'When the Self is known, all this is\nknown,' and 'All this is that Self.' That the Self is everything, is proved by\nthe declaration that the whole world of names, forms, and works springs from\none being, and is merged in one being  1; and by its being demonstrated, with\nthe help of the similes of the drum, and so on, that effect and cause are non-\ndifferent. The fulfilment of the promise is, then, finally indicated by the\ntext declaring that that great Being rises, in the form of the individual\nsoul, from out of these elements; thus the teacher \xc3\x82 _s_ marathya thinks. For\nif the soul and the highest Self are non-different, the promise that through\nthe knowledge of one everything becomes known is capable of\nfulfilment.--'Because the soul when it will depart is such; thus Au _d_ ulomi\nthinks.' The statement as to the non-difference of the soul and the Self\n(implied in the declaration that the great Being rises, &c.) is possible,\nbecause the soul when--after having purified itself by knowledge, and so on--\nit will depart from the body, is capable of becoming one with the highest\nSelf. This is Au _d_ ulomi's opinion.--'Because it exists in the condition of\nthe soul; thus Ka _s_ ak _ri_ tsna opines.' Because the highest Self itself is\nthat which appears as the individual soul, the statement as to the non-\ndifference of the two is well-founded. This is the view of the teacher Ka _s_\nak _ri_ tsna.\n\nBut, an objection may be raised, the passage, 'Rising from out of these\nelements he vanishes again after them. When he has departed there is no more\nknowledge,' intimates the final destruction of the soul, not its identity with\nthe highest Self!--By no means, we reply. The passage means to say\n\np. 281\n\nonly that on the soul departing from the body all specific cognition vanishes,\nnot that the Self is destroyed. For an objection being raised--in the passage,\n'Here thou hast bewildered me, Sir, when thou sayest that having departed\nthere is no more knowledge'. Scripture itself explains that what is meant is\nnot the annihilation of the Self, 'I say nothing that is bewildering. Verily,\nbeloved, that Self is imperishable, and of an indestructible nature. But there\ntakes place non-connexion with the matras.' That means: The eternally\nunchanging Self, which is one mass of knowledge, cannot possibly perish; but\nby means of true knowledge there is effected its dissociation from the matras,\ni.e. the elements and the sense organs, which are the product of Nescience.\nWhen the connexion has been solved, specific cognition, which depended on it,\nno longer takes place, and thus it can be said, that 'When he has departed\nthere is no more knowledge.'\n\nThe third argument also of the purvapakshin, viz. that the word 'knower'--\nwhich occurs in the concluding passage, 'How should he know the knower?'--\ndenotes an agent, and therefore refers to the individual soul as the object of\nsight, is to be refuted according to the view of Ka _s_ ak _ri_ tsna.--\nMoreover, the text after having enumerated--in the passage, 'For where there\nis duality as it were, there one sees the other,' &c.--all the kinds of\nspecific cognition which belong to the sphere of Nescience declares--in the\nsubsequent passage, 'But when the Self only is all this, how should he see\nanother?'--that in the sphere of true knowledge all specific cognition such as\nseeing, and so on, is absent. And, again, in order to obviate the doubt\nwhether in the absence of objects the knower might not know himself, Ya _g\n\xc3\xb1_avalkya goes on, 'How, O beloved, should he know himself, the knower?' As\nthus the latter passage evidently aims at proving the absence of specific\ncognition, we have to conclude that the word 'knower' is here used to denote\nthat being which is knowledge, i.e. the Self.--That the view of Ka _s_ ak _ri_\ntsna is scriptural, we have already shown above. And as it is so, all the\nadherents of the Vedanta must admit that the difference of the soul and the\nhighest Self is not\n\np. 282\n\nreal, but due to the limiting adjuncts, viz. the body, and so on, which are\nthe product of name and form as presented by Nescience. That view receives\nample confirmation from Scripture; compare, for instance, 'Being only, my\ndear, this was in the beginning, one, without a second' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 2, 1);\n'The Self is all this' ( _Kh_. Up. VII, 25, 2); 'Brahman alone is all this'\n(Mu. Up. II, 2, 11); 'This everything is that Self (B _ri_. Up. II, 4, 6);\n'There is no other seer but he' (B _ri_. Up. III, 7, 23); 'There is nothing\nthat sees but it' (B _ri_. Up. III, 8, 11).--It is likewise confirmed by Sm\n_ri_ ti; compare, for instance, 'Vasudeva is all this' (Bha. Gi. VII, 19);\n'Know me, O Bharata, to be the soul in all bodies' (Bha. Gi. XIII, 2); 'He who\nsees the highest Lord abiding alike within all creatures' (Bha. Gi. XIII, 27).\n--The same conclusion is supported by those passages which deny all\ndifference; compare, for instance, 'If he thinks, that is one and I another;\nhe does not know' (B _ri_. Up. I, 4, 10); 'From death to death he goes who\nsees here any diversity' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 19). And, again, by those\npassages which negative all change on the part of the Self; compare, for\ninstance, 'This great unborn Self, undecaying, undying, immortal, fearless is\nindeed Brahman' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 24).--Moreover, if the doctrine of general\nidentity were not true, those who are desirous of release could not be in the\npossession of irrefutable knowledge, and there would be no possibility of any\nmatter being well settled; while yet the knowledge of which the Self is the\nobject is declared to be irrefutable and to satisfy all desire, and Scripture\nspeaks of those, 'Who have well ascertained the object of the knowledge of the\nVedanta' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 6). Compare also the passage, 'What trouble, what\nsorrow can there be to him who has once beheld that unity?' (I _s_. Up.\n7.)--And Sm _ri_ ti also represents the mind of him who contemplates the Self\nas steady (Bha. Gi. II, 54).\n\nAs therefore the individual soul and the highest Self differ in name only, it\nbeing a settled matter that perfect knowledge has for its object the absolute\noneness of the two; it is senseless to insist (as some do) on a plurality of\nSelfs, and to maintain that the individual soul is different from the\n\np. 283\n\nhighest Self, and the highest Self from the individual soul. For the Self is\nindeed called by many different names, but it is one only. Nor does the\npassage, 'He who knows Brahman which is real, knowledge, infinite, as hidden\nin the cave' (Taitt. Up. II, 1), refer to some one cave (different from the\nabode of the individual soul) 1. And that nobody else but Brahman is hidden in\nthe cave we know from a subsequent passage, viz. 'Having sent forth he entered\ninto it' (Taitt. Up. II, 6), according to which the creator only entered into\nthe created beings.--Those who insist on the distinction of the individual and\nthe highest Self oppose themselves to the true sense of the Vedanta-texts,\nstand thereby in the way of perfect knowledge, which is the door to perfect\nbeatitude, and groundlessly assume release to be something effected, and\ntherefore non-eternal 2. (And if they attempt to show that moksha, although\neffected, is eternal) they involve themselves in a conflict with sound logic.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[278:2](sbe34133.htm#fr_249) Compare the note to the same mantra as quoted\nabove under I, 1, 11.\n\n[279:1](sbe34133.htm#fr_250) And not the relation of absolute identity.\n\n[279:2](sbe34133.htm#fr_251) I.e. upon the state of emancipation and its\nabsence.\n\n[280:1](sbe34133.htm#fr_252) Upapadita _m_ _k_ eti, sarvasyatmamatratvam iti\n_s_ esha _h_.
