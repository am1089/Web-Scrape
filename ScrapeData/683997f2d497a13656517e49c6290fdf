Nand. states that in both of these Sutras it has to be understood, that\nthe bath occasioned by the eclipse must be followed by the ordinary bath,\nwhich precedes every meal.\n\n6\\. An Agnihotrin is one who daily performs the Agnihotra. Regarding the\nAgnihotra and the times for its performance, see LIX, 2.\n\n7\\. The term Vai _s_ vadeva includes not only the oblation to the Vi _s_\nvedevas (LXVII, 3), but also the Bali-offerings and the entertainment of a\nguest, &c., as prescribed in LXVII, 4 seq.

Nand., quoting a passage of Vasish _th_ a (XIV, 28), states the use of\nthe particle _k_ a to imply, that food twice cooked and food cooked in a\nfrying-pan should also be avoided.\n\n27\\.

Then he must sprinkle water all around it, with the Mantra,\n"Forsooth, I sprinkle righteousness around thee" After that he must sip water\nwith the Mantra, "Thou art an imperishable basis" (Taitt. \xc3\x82ra _ny_. X, 32,\nrendered according to Saya _n_ a\'s Commentary), and offer up five oblations to\nPra _n_ a, &c. (see Dr. Buhler\'s note on \xc3\x82past. II, 1, 1, 2). Finally he must\neat in silence, without blaming the food, and taking care to leave some\nremnant of it in the dish, and sip water again, with the Mantra, "Thou art an\nimperishable covering"\' (Taitt. \xc3\x82ra _ny_. X, 35, according to Saya _n_ a).]\n\np. 221\n\n44\\. He must not eat up his food completely;\n\n45\\.

Let him never eat in an empty house, in a house where the sacred fires\nare preserved, or in a temple dedicated to the gods. Neither must he drink\nwater out of his joined hands, or satiate himself to repletion.\n\n48, Let him not take a third meal (over and above the two regular meals in the\nmornings and evenings), nor let him ever take unwholesome food. He must eat\nneither too early, nor too late, and he must take no food in the evening,\nafter having fully satiated himself in the morning.\n\n49\\. He must not eat bad food (whether injurious to health or otherwise\nreprehensible), nor from a bad dish (which is similar to the dishes used by\nbarbarians, or which has been defiled by a wicked man eating from it), nor\nlying on the ground, nor with his feet raised upon a bench, nor sitting on his\nhams with a cloth tied round his legs and knees.\n\n[46. Nand. thinks that this rule refers to those wives only who belong to a\nlower caste than their husbands.\n\n48\\. \'Too early\' means before sunrise; \'too late\' means immediately before\nsunset.
