(Brahman is) the material cause on account of this not being in conflict\nwith the promissory statements and the illustrative instances.\n\nThe claims raised by the atheistic Sa _n_ khya having thus been disposed of,\nthe theistic Sa _n_ khya comes forward as an opponent. It must indeed be\nadmitted, he says, that the Vedanta-texts teach the cause of the world to be\nan all-knowing Lord; for they attribute to that cause thought and similar\ncharacteristics. But at the same time we learn from those same texts that the\nmaterial cause of the world is none other than the Pradhana; with an all-\nknowing, unchanging superintending Lord they connect a Pradhana,\n\np. 397\n\nruled by him, which is non-intelligent and undergoes changes, and the two\ntogether only they represent as the cause of the world. This view is conveyed\nby the following texts, \'who is without parts, without actions, tranquil,\nwithout fault, without taint\' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 18); \'This great unborn Self,\nundecaying, undying\' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 25); \'He knows her who produces all\neffects, the non-knowing one, the unborn one, wearing eight forms, the firm\none. Ruled by him she is spread out, and incited and guided by him gives birth\nto the world for the benefit of the souls. A cow she is without beginning and\nend, a mother producing all beings\' (see above, p. 363). That the Lord creates\nthis world in so far only as guiding Prak _ri_ ti, the material cause, we\nlearn from the following text, \'From that the Lord of Maya creates all this.\nKnow Maya to be Prak _ri_ ti and the Lord of Maya the great Lord\' ( _S_ vet.\nUp. IV, 9, 10). And similarly Sm _ri_ ti, \'with me as supervisor Prak _ri_ ti\nbrings forth the Universe of the movable and the immovable\' (Bha. G\xc3\x8e. IX, 10).\nAlthough, therefore, the Pradhana is not expressly stated by Scripture to be\nthe material cause, we must assume that there is such a Pradhana and that,\nsuperintended by the Lord, it constitutes the material cause, because\notherwise the texts declaring Brahman to be the cause of the world would not\nbe fully intelligible. For ordinary experience shows us on all sides that the\noperative cause and the material cause are quite distinct: we invariably have\non the one side clay, gold, and other material substances which form the\nmaterial causes of pots, ornaments, and so on, and on the other hand, distinct\nfrom them, potters, goldsmiths, and so on, who act as operative causes. And we\nfurther observe that the production of effects invariably requires several\ninstrumental agencies. The Vedanta-texts therefore cannot possess the strength\nto convince us, in open defiance of the two invariable rules, that the one\nBrahman is at the same time the material and the operative cause of the world;\nand hence we maintain that Brahman is only the operative but not the material\ncause, while the material cause is the Pradhana guided by Brahman.\n\np. 398\n\nThis prima facie view the Sutra combats. Prak _ri_ ti, i.e. the material\ncause, not only the operative cause, is Brahman only; this view being in\nharmony with the promissory declaration and the illustrative instances. The\npromissory declaration is the one referring to the knowledge of all things\nthrough the knowledge of one, \'Did you ever ask for that instruction by which\nthat which is not heard becomes heard?\' &c. ( _Kh_ , Up. VI, 1, 3). And the\nillustrative instances are those which set forth the knowledge of the effect\nas resulting from the knowledge of the cause, \'As by one lump of clay there is\nmade known all that is made of clay; as by one nugget of gold, &c.; as by one\ninstrument for paring the nails,\' &c. ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 1, 4). If Brahman were\nmerely the operative cause of the world, the knowledge of the entire world\nwould not result from the knowledge of Brahman; not any more than we know the\npot when we know the potter. And thus scriptural declaration and illustrative\ninstances would be stultified. But if Brahman is the general material cause,\nthen the knowledge of Brahman implies the knowledge of its effect, i.e. the\nworld, in the same way as the knowledge of such special material causes as a\nlump of clay, a nugget of gold, an instrument for paring the nails, implies\nthe knowledge of all things made of clay, gold or iron--such as pots,\nbracelets, diadems, hatchets, and so on. For an effect is not a substance\ndifferent from its cause, but the cause itself which has passed into a\ndifferent state. The initial declaration thus being confirmed by the instances\nof clay and its products, &c., which stand in the relation of cause and\neffect, we conclude that Brahman only is the material cause of the world. That\nScripture teaches the operative and the material causes to be separate, is not\ntrue; it rather teaches the unity of the two. For in the text, \'Have you asked\nfor that ade _s_ a (above, and generally, understood to mean "instruction"),\nby which that which is not heard becomes heard?\' the word \'ade _s_ a\' has to\nbe taken to mean _ruler_ , in agreement with the text, \'by the command--or\nrule--of that Imperishable sun and moon stand apart\' (B _ri_. Up. III, 8, 9),\nso that the passage means, \'Have you asked for that\n\np. 399\n\n[paragraph continues] Ruler by whom, when heard and known, even that which is\nnot heard and known, becomes heard and known?\' This clearly shows the unity of\nthe operative (ruling or supervising) cause and the material cause; taken in\nconjunction with the subsequent declaration of the unity of the cause previous\nto creation, \'Being only, this was in the beginning, one only,\' and the denial\nof a further operative cause implied in the further qualification \'advitiyam,\'\ni.e. \'without a second.\'--But how then have we to understand texts such as the\none quoted above (from the _K_ ulika-Upanishad) which declare Prak _ri_ ti to\nbe eternal and the material cause of the world?--Prak _ri_ ti, we reply, in\nsuch passages denotes Brahman in its causal phase when names and forms are not\nyet distinguished. For a principle independent of Brahman does not exist, as\nwe know from texts such as \'Everything abandons him who views anything as\napart from the Self; and \'But where for him the Self has become all, whereby\nshould he see whom?\' (B _ri_. Up. II, 4, 6; 15). Consider also the texts, \'All\nthis is Brahman\' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 14, 1); and \'All this has its Self in that\'\n( _Kh_. Up. VI, 8, 7); which declare that the world whether in its causal or\nits effected condition has Brahman for its Self. The relation of the world to\nBrahman has to be conceived in agreement with scriptural texts such as \'He who\nmoves within the earth,\' &c., up to \'He who moves within the Imperishable\';\nand \'He who dwells within the earth,\' &c., up to \'He who dwells within the\nSelf (B _ri_. Up. III, 7, 3-23). The highest Brahman, having the whole\naggregate of non-sentient and sentient beings for its body, ever is the Self\nof all. Sometimes, however, names and forms are not evolved, not distinguished\nin Brahman; at other times they are evolved, distinct. In the latter state\nBrahman is called an effect and manifold; in the former it is called one,\nwithout a second, the cause. This causal state of Brahman is meant where the\ntext quoted above speaks of the cow without beginning and end, giving birth to\neffects, and so on.--But, the text, \'The great one is merged in the Unevolved,\nthe Unevolved is merged in the Imperishable,\' intimates that the Unevolved\noriginates\n\np. 400\n\nand again passes away; and similarly the Mahabharata says, \'from that there\nsprung the Non-evolved comprising the three gu _n_ as; the Non-evolved is\nmerged in the indivisible Person.\'--These texts, we reply, present no real\ndifficulty. For Brahman having non-sentient matter for its body, that state\nwhich consists of the three gu _n_ as and is denoted by the term \'Unevolved\'\nis something effected. And the text, \'When there was darkness, neither day nor\nnight,\' states that also in a total pralaya non-sentient matter having Brahman\nfor its Self continues to exist in a highly subtle condition. This highly\nsubtle matter stands to Brahman the cause of the world in the relation of a\nmode (prakara), and it is Brahman viewed as having such a mode that the text\nfrom the _K_ ul. Upanishad refers to. For this reason also the text, \'the\nImperishable is merged in darkness, darkness becomes one with the highest\nGod,\' declares not that darkness is completely merged and lost in the Divinity\nbut only that it becomes one with it; what the text wants to intimate is that\nstate of Brahman in which, having for its mode extremely subtle matter here\ncalled \'Darkness,\' it abides without evolving names and forms. The mantra,\n\'There was darkness, hidden in darkness,\' &c. ( _Ri_. Sa _m_ h. X, 129, 3),\nsets forth the same view; and so does Manu (I, 5), \'This universe existed in\nthe shape of Darkness, unperceived, destitute of distinctive marks,\nunattainable by reasoning, unknowable, wholly immersed as it were in deep\nsleep.\' And, as to the text, \'from that the Lord of Maya creates everything,\'\nwe shall prove later on the unchangeableness of Brahman, and explain the\nscriptural texts asserting it.\n\nAs to the contention raised by the Purvapakshin that on the basis of\ninvariable experience it must be held that one and the same principle cannot\nbe both material and operative cause, and that effects cannot be brought about\nby one agency, and that hence the Vedanta-texts can no more establish the view\nof Brahman being the sole cause than the command \'sprinkle with fire\' will\nconvince us that fire may perform the office of water; we simply remark that\nthe highest Brahman which totally differs in nature from\n\np. 401\n\nall other beings, which is omnipotent and omniscient, can by itself accomplish\neverything. The invariable rule of experience holds good, on the other hand,\nwith regard to clay and similar materials which are destitute of intelligence\nand hence incapable of guiding and supervising; and with regard to potters and\nsimilar agents who do not possess the power of transforming themselves into\nmanifold products, and cannot directly realise their intentions.--The\nconclusion therefore remains that Brahman alone is the material as well as the\noperative cause of the Universe.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 24.
