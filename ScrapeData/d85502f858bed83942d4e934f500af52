The order (in which the elements are retracted into Brahman) is the\nreverse of that (i.e. the order in which they are created); this is proved (by\nits agreement with observation).\n\nHaving considered the order of the creation of the elements we now proceed to\nconsider the order of their retractation.--The question here is whether their\nretractation takes place in an indefinite order, or in the order of the\ncreation, or in the inverse order. That the origin, the subsistence and the\nretractation of the elements all depend on Brahman, scripture declares 'That\nfrom whence these beings are born, that by which when born they live, that\ninto which they enter at their death.'\n\nThe purvapakshintains that the retractation of the elements is not bound to\nany definite order, because scripture contains no specific information on the\npoint. Or else, he says, let him who wishes to know the order of the\nretractation accept the order of creation, since the latter is expressly\nmentioned in the texts.\n\nTo this we reply that the order of retractation must be viewed as the reverse\nof the order of creation. For we see\n\np. 26\n\nin ordinary life that a man who has ascended a stair has, in descending, to\ntake the steps in the reverse order. Moreover we observe that things made of\nclay, such as jars, dishes, &c., on being destroyed pass back into clay, and\nthat things which have originated from water, such as snow and hailstones,\nagain dissolve into water. Hence we rightly assume that earth which has\n(according to scripture) sprung from water passes back into water when the\nperiod of its subsistence comes to an end, and that water which has sprung\nfrom fire passes back into fire. In this way each particular effect passes\nback into its immediately antecedent cause--each cause being of a subtler\nnature than its effect--until in the end the last cause is refunded into\nBrahman, the ultimate and most subtle of all causes. It certainly would be\nirrational to assume that an effect, passing over its immediate cause, should\nat once refund itself into the cause of the cause. Sm _ri_ ti also declares\nthat the order of retractation is the order of origination inverted, 'The\nearth, the basis of the world, is dissolved into water, O divine _Ri_ shi, the\nwater into fire, the fire into air.' The order of creation is indeed stated in\nthe sacred texts, but that statement refers to creation only, and can\ntherefore not be extended to retractation. We, moreover, cannot even desire to\napply the order in which the elements are created to their retractation also\nsince it is clearly unsuitable in the latter case. For, as long as an effect\nsubsists, it is impossible to assume the dissolution of the cause, since on\nthe dissolution of the latter the effect also cannot exist. On the other hand,\nwe may assume a continued existence of the cause although the effect be\ndestroyed; for that is actually observed in the case of clay (and the things\nmade of it).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 15](sbe38016.htm)\n\n"
