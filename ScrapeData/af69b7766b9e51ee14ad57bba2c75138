Having drawn the cups of Soma, and gone out (of the cart-shed to\nthe high altar) 1, he offers the oblation of drops 2. The reason why he offers\nthe oblation of drops is this. Whatever drops of that (Soma) are spilt here,\nto them he now wishes a safe journey to the \xc3\x82havaniya, for the \xc3\x82havaniya is\nthe resting-place of offerings: this is why he offers the oblation of drops.\n\n4:2:5:22\\. He offers with (Va _g_. S. VII, 26; Rig-veda X, 17, 12), 'Whatever\ndrop of thine leapeth\n\np. 306\n\naway, whatever stalk of thine,'--whatever particle (of Soma) is spilt, that is\na drop, that indeed he means; and by 'whatever stalk of thine' he mentions the\nstalk;--'stone-pressed, from the lap of the press-bowls;' for pressed by the\nstone 1 it leaps away from the two press-bowls;--'be it from the Adhvaryu or\nfrom the strainer,'--for it leaps away either from the Adhvaryu's hands or\nfrom the strainer,--'that I offer unto thee in my mind consecrated by Vasha\n_t_ , Hail!' whereby it becomes for him as an offering consecrated by Vasha\n_t_.\n\n4:2:5:33\\. Thereupon the Adhvaryu takes two stalks of grass from the covered\naltar. The two Adhvaryus 2 proceed first (to the chanting-place beside the\npit), as the out-breathing and in-breathing of the sacrifice; then the Prastot\n_ri_ , as the voice of the sacrifice; then the Udgat _ri_ , as the self (or\nbody), the Pra _g_ apati, of the sacrifice; then the Pratihart _ri_ , either\nas the physician or the through-breathing 3.\n\n4:2:5:44\\. The Sacrificer holds on to those five priests from behind 4, for as\nmuch as those five priests are, so much is the whole sacrifice, the sacrifice\nbeing fivefold: hence the Sacrificer thereby holds on to the sacrifice.\n\n4:2:5:55\\. He (the Adhvaryu) then throws one of the two\n\np. 307\n\nstalks of grass forward towards the pit 1, with, 'Thou art the ascent of the\ngods!' for when the gods through the sacrifice attained to the heavenly world,\nit was from that pit that they went upwards to the heavenly world: he thus\nmakes the sacrificer look along the road to heaven.\n\n4:2:5:66\\. He then throws down the other stalk in front of the chanters,\nsilently, for those chanters represent the hymn of praise (stotra), Pra _g_\napati (the sacrifice),--he (Pra _g_ apati) draws to himself everything here,\nand takes possession of everything here: it is to him that that stalk is\noffered, and thus he does not draw the Adhvaryu to himself, and take\npossession of him. And when they mutter 2,--for the chanters mutter now 3,--\n\n4:2:5:77\\. Then he bespeaks the chant, saying, 'Soma becometh pure!' He\nbespeaks the chant right off 4, and they chant right off; for these chants,\nthe Pavamana _h_  5, are directed towards the gods, since\n\np. 308\n\nthe gods thereby attained to the heavenly world right off (straightway):\ntherefore he bespeaks the chant right off, and right off they chant.\n\n4:2:5:88\\. With 'Turn ye back 1!' (he bespeaks) the other chants (viz. the\nDhuryas), and turning back (or repeating) they chant the Dhuryas 2, for the\nlatter\n\np. 309\n\nare directed towards these creatures: whence creatures are produced here\nrepeatedly.\n\n4:2:5:99\\. And as to why they chant the Bahishpavamana here (near the _k_\natvala). In the beginning, forsooth, yonder sun was here on earth 1. The\nseasons embraced him and ascended from hence to the heavenly world: there he\nburns firmly established\n\np. 310\n\nin the seasons. And in like manner do the priests thereby embrace the\nsacrificer and ascend from hence to the heavenly world: this is why they chant\nthe Bahishpavamana h ere.\n\n4:2:5:1010\\. The Bahishpavamana 1 chant truly is a ship\n\np. 311\n\nbound heavenwards: the priests are its spars and oars, the means of reaching\nthe heavenly world. If there be a blameworthy one, even that one (priest)\nwould make it sink: he makes it sink, even as one who ascends a ship that is\nfull would make it sink. And, indeed, every sacrifice is a ship bound\nheavenwards: hence one should seek to keep a blameworthy (priest) away from\nevery sacrifice.\n\n4:2:5:1111\\. Thereupon, when the chanting is over 1, he\n\np. 312\n\nutters this speech,--'Agnidh, spread the fires! strew the barhis! Prepare the\ncakes! go on with the victim!' The Agnidh spreads the fires, that is to say,\nkindles them 1; he strews that barhis 2, thinking, 'When the barhis is strewn,\nI will offer to the gods on the kindled (fire).'--'Prepare the cakes,' he\nsays, because he is about to proceed with the cakes; and, 'Go on with the\nvictim,' because he is about to get ready the victim 3.\n\n4:2:5:1212\\. Having again entered (the cart-shed) he draws the \xc3\x82 _s_ vina\ngraha 4. Having drawn the \xc3\x82 _s_ vina graha he goes out and girds the\nsacrificial stake 5; and having girt the stake he gets ready the victim: he\nthereby puts flavour (juice) into him (Soma--the sacrificer).\n\n4:2:5:1313\\. Having been slain at the morning feast, it continues being cooked\ntill the evening feast; whereby he puts flavour (juice) into the whole\nsacrifice, imbues it with flavour.\n\n4:2:5:1414\\. Let him therefore, at the Agnish _t_ oma, slay a (victim) sacred\nto Agni, for there is harmony when, at the Agnish _t_ oma, he slays a (victim)\nfor Agni. If\n\np. 313\n\nit be an Ukthya sacrifice, let him slay one to Indra and Agni in the second\nplace, for songs of praise (uktha) 1 refer to Indra and Agni. If it be a Sho\n_d_ a _s_ in sacrifice, let him slay one to Indra in the third place, for the\nsixteenfold chant (sho _d_ a _s_ in) 2 means Indra. If it be an Atiratra, let\nhim slay one to Sarasvati in the fourth place, for Sarasvati is speech, and\nspeech (va _k_ , fem.) is female, as the night (ratri, fem.) is female: he\nthus duly distinguishes the forms of sacrifice 3.\n\np. 314\n\n4:2:5:1515\\. Thereupon he proceeds with (the offering of) the cakes of the\nSoma feast. Now Soma is a god, for Soma was in the heaven;--'Soma, forsooth,\nwas V _ri_ tra; the mountains and stones are his body: thereon grows that\nplant called U _s_ ana,' said _S_ vetaketu Auddalaki; that they bring hither\nand press.'\n\n4:2:5:1616\\. Now when he slays the victim, he thereby puts flavour into it;\nand when he proceeds with (the offering of) the Soma feast cakes, he puts sap\ninto it: thus it becomes Soma for him.\n\n4:2:5:1717\\. They all belong to Indra; for Indra is the deity of the\nsacrifice: that is why they all belong to Indra.\n\n4:2:5:1818\\. And as to why there are a cake, parched barley-grain, a porridge,\nsour curds, and clotted curds,--it is that those who are the deities of the\nsacrifice shall be well-pleased.\n\n4:2:5:1919\\. For, when one has eaten cake here, he wishes, 'I should like to\ntake parched grains, I should like to eat porridge, I should like to eat sour\ncurds, I should like to eat clotted curds!' All these (are Objects of one's)\nwishes: it is in order that those who are the deities of the sacrifice shall\nbe well-pleased. Now as to why that offering of clotted curds (payasya) is\nprepared only at the morning libation, and not at the two other libations\n(Soma feasts).\n\n4:2:5:2020\\. The Gayatri, forsooth, bears the morning libation (to the gods),\nthe Trish _t_ ubh the midday libation, and the _G_ agati the evening libation,\n--but, then, the Trish _t_ ubh bears the midday libation, not alone, (but)\nwith both the Gayatri and the B _ri_ hati 1; and the _G_ agati (bears) the\nevening libation, not alone,\n\np. 315\n\n[paragraph continues] (but) with the Gayatri, the Kakubh, and Ush _n_ ih, and\nthe Anush _t_ ubh 1.\n\n4:2:5:2121\\. The Gayatri alone bears singly the morning libation,--with those\ntwo sets of five (pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti) 2, the set of five chants, and the set of five\noblations: there are four \xc3\x82 _g_ ya (chants) 3 and the Bahishpavamana is the\nfifth,--the Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti metre is five-footed with that pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti of chants, not alone,\nthe Gayatri bears the morning libation.\n\n4:2:5:2222\\. To Indra belongs the cake, to the two bay steeds the parched\ngrains (dhana _h_ ) 4, to Pushan the porridge (karambha), to Sarasvati the\nsour curds (dadhi), and to Mitra and Varu _n_ a the clotted curds (payasya) 5,\n--the Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti is five-footed--with that pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti of oblations, not alone, the\nGayatri bears the\n\np. 316\n\nmorning libation (to the gods): for the sake of completing that pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti, that\noblation of clotted curds to Mitra and Varu _n_ a is prepared only at the\nmorning libation, and not at the two other libations.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[305:1](sbe2649.htm#fr_736) The libations (grahas) having been taken, and the\nremaining Nigrabhya water, mixed with Soma-juice, poured from the Hot _ri_ 's\ncup into the Dro _n_ akala _s_ a ([p. 256](sbe2640.htm#page_256), note\n[1](sbe2641.htm#fn_619)), the Adhvaryu, Pratiprasthat _ri_ ; Prastot _ri_ ,\nUdgat _ri_ , Pratihart _ri_ , and Sacrificer walk out of the Havirdhana shed,\neach following one touching the hem of the garment of the one before him, and\nbetake themselves to the altar.\n\n[305:2](sbe2649.htm#fr_737) The vipru _d_ -homa, an expiatory oblation for the\nSoma spilt during the pressing, consists of a pra _k_ arani spoon full of\nghee. According to \xc3\x82 _s_ v. V, 2, 6, and La _t_ y. I, 11, 9, it would seem\nthat each of those taking part in the Sarpa _n_ a (see [p.\n299](sbe2648.htm#page_299), note [2](sbe2648.htm#fn_719)) makes two oblations\n(called 'prav _ri_ tta-homa' by La _t_ y. Sr. and Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ avi _m_ _s_ a\nBr.).\n\n[306:1](sbe2649.htm#fr_738) 'Grava- _k_ yuta' seems to be taken by the author\nin the sense of set in motion by the (pressing) stone.' The Rig-veda reads\n'bahu- _k_ yuta;' also 'dhisha _n_ aya _h_ ' instead of 'dhisha _n_ ayo _h_.'\n\n[306:2](sbe2649.htm#fr_739) That is, the Adhvaryu and his assistant, the\nPratiprasthat _ri_.\n\n[306:3](sbe2649.htm#fr_740) Ait. Br. II, 20 enumerates Adhvaryu, Prastot _ri_\n; Pratihart _ri_ ; Udgat _ri_ , and Brahman (see also \xc3\x82 _s_ v. V, 2, 4-5); the\nLa _t_ yay. Sutra I, 11, Adhvaryu, Prastot _ri_ , Udgat _ri_ ; Pratihart _ri_\n, Brahman, and Sacrificer.\n\n[306:4](sbe2649.htm#fr_741) That is, each holds on to the hem of the garment\nof the one who precedes him.\n\n[307:1](sbe2649.htm#fr_742) The Udgat _ri_ s (chanters) also throw stalks of\ngrass to the south with their left hands, with the text, Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ av. I, 3,\n3.\n\n[307:2](sbe2649.htm#fr_743) And when he thinks 'they have muttered' (atha yada\nmanyate ' _g_ apishur iti)--for the chanters mutter now. Ka _n_ va text.\n\n[307:3](sbe2649.htm#fr_744) For the mantras the Udgat _ri_ s have to mutter on\nthis occasion, previous to the chanting, see Ta _n_ _d_ ya Br. I, 3, 4-6. The\nrecitation of the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya _s_ astra, by the Hot _ri_ , succeeding the\nchanting of the Bahishpavamana-stotra, is likewise preceded by a prayer\nmuttered by that priest, for which see Ait. Br. II, 38; \xc3\x82 _s_ v. V, 9.\n\n[307:4](sbe2649.htm#fr_745) That is, without repeating that formula, in the\nsame way as the Pavamana chants are performed without repeating single verses.\nSee p. 308, note 2.\n\n[307:5](sbe2649.htm#fr_746) The first stotra at each pressing is called\npavamana (purifying, i.e. during the chanting of which the Soma becomes\nclarified), viz. the Bahishpavamana at the morning, the Madhyandina pavamana\nat the midday, and the \xc3\x82rbhava (or t _ri_ tiya) pavamana at the evening\npressing. The other stotras are called Dhurya, 'to be harnessed, belonging to\nor forming a team.' For the correspondence between the stotra and _s_ astra,\nsee [p. 325](sbe2650.htm#page_325), note [2](sbe2651.htm#fn_774).\n\n[308:1](sbe2649.htm#fr_747) This is Saya _n_ a's interpretation of\n'upavartadhvam,' instead of 'draw near,' as translated by me at I, 5, 2, 12.\nHe is probably right in connecting it with the repetitions which certain\nverses have to undergo in the dhurya-stotras.\n\n[308:2](sbe2649.htm#fr_748) There are many different stomas, or forms of\nchanting stotras, named from the number of verses produced in each form\n(generally by repetitions of certain verses). Those required for the Sha _d_\naha and Dvada _s_ aha (see IV, 5, 4, 1 seq.) are: triv _ri_ t (9), pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_\nada _s_ a (15), saptada _s_ a 07), ekavi _m_ _s_ a (21), tri _n_ ava (27),\ntrayastri _m_ _s_ a (33), _k_ aturvi _m_ _s_ a (24), _k_ atu _s_ _k_ atvari\n_m_ _s_ a (44), and ashta _k_ atvari _m_ _s_ a (48). The first four of these\nare those most frequently used, and the only ones used at the Agnish _t_ oma.\nAll these stomas, with one exception (24), have two or more different\nvarieties or arrangements, called vish _t_ uti, differing from one another\neither in the order in which the several verses are to be chanted, or in\nregard to the number of repetitions which the corresponding verses have to\nundergo. Besides, stomas are generally performed in three turns or rounds,\nparyaya, consisting of a triplet of verses (some of which may have to be\nrepeated more than once), and preceded by the sound 'hu _m_ ' (Hi\xe1\xb9\x85kara). Thus\nthe first \xc3\x82 _g_ yastotra, Samav. II, 10-12, (consisting of three verses, a, b,\nc,) is to be performed in the pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a-stoma; that is, the three\nverses have to be so treated, by repetitions, as to produce fifteen verses in\nthree turns. Now, as there are three different varieties of performing the pa\n_\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a-stoma, the stotra might be chanted in one or other of the\nfollowing three arrangements:--\n\n1.\n\n|\n\nHu _m_\n\n|\n\na a a\n\n|\n\nb\n\n|\n\nc\n\n|\n\nthis form is called 'pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a-pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ini,' i.e. consisting of five in\neach row.  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nHu _m_\n\n|\n\na\n\n|\n\nb b b\n\n|\n\nc  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nHu _m_\n\n|\n\na\n\n|\n\nb\n\n|\n\nc c c  \n  \n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \nOr 2.\n\n|\n\nHu _m_\n\n|\n\na a a\n\n|\n\nb\n\n|\n\nc\n\n|\n\n('apara' or 'other, second').  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nHu _m_\n\n|\n\na\n\n|\n\nb\n\n|\n\nc  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nHu _m_\n\n|\n\na\n\n|\n\nb b b\n\n|\n\nc c c  \n  \n\n\n|\n\np. 309\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \nOr 3.\n\n|\n\nHu _m_\n\n|\n\na\n\n|\n\nb\n\n|\n\nc\n\n|\n\nthis form is called 'udyati,'  \nor the ascending one.  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nHu _m_\n\n|\n\na\n\n|\n\nb b b\n\n|\n\nc  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nHu _m_\n\n|\n\na a a\n\n|\n\nb\n\n|\n\nc c c  \n  \nThe three paryayas of a stoma (or vish _t_ uti) show each three subdivisions\n(viz. a a a--b--c. being those of the first paryaya above), called vish _t_\nava. When the Udgat _ri_ s are about to commence a chant, the Prastot _ri_\nspreads in their midst a cloth, doubled up so that the unwoven fringe lies\nover the selvage, either towards the east or north. Thereon he marks the\nsubdivisions of the rounds, by means of sticks (ku _s_ a), a span long, of\nsome kind of wood suitable for sacrifice, split lengthways along the pith (the\nbark being left outside) and somewhat pointed at one end, then smeared over\nwith some fragrant substance, and wrapped up singly in pieces of the same kind\nof cloth as that spread on the ground. The marking of the vish _t_ avas, or\nsubdivisions, takes place at the end of the prastava or prelude (see next\npage, note 1) in this way, that each vish _t_ ava is marked by as many sticks\nas the corresponding verse has to be repeated; those of the first vish _t_ ava\nbeing laid down with the point to the north, then behind or west of them those\nof the second turn with the point to the west, and behind them those of the\nthird turn with the point to the north. Thereupon those of the other two\nrounds are laid down in the same way, each turn north of the preceding one.\nHence the arrangement of sticks for the first of the above varieties of the pa\n_\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a-stoma would be three straight, one across, one straight; one\nstraight, three across, one straight; one straight, one across, three\nstraight.\n\nWith the exception of the Bahishpavamana, the chanting is performed in the\nSadas by the side of the Udumbara post (see [III, 6, 1,\n2](sbe2623.htm#3:6:1:2) seq.), the latter being likewise enclosed in a cloth\nof the above description, wrapt round it from left to right, with the unwoven\nfringe towards the top.\n\n[309:1](sbe2649.htm#fr_749) Cf. Ta _n_ _d_ ya Br. VI, 7, 24.\n\n[310:1](sbe2649.htm#fr_750) The Bahishpavamana-(stotra), or 'outside-\npavamana,'--so called because (on the first day of a Soma-sacrifice) it is\nperformed outside the altar (commentary on Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ av. Br. VI, 8, 10-11; or\noutside the Sadas, Say. on Samav. S. p. 47),--is chanted in the Triv _ri_ t,\nor threefold, stoma; consisting, as it does, of three gayatri triplets (Samav.\nII, 1-9 for the Agnish _t_ oma), and none of its verses being chanted more\nthan once. This stoma has three different varieties, viz. the udyati, or\nascending mode, the first turn of which consists of the first verses of the\nthree triplets, the second turn of the second verses, and the third turn of\nthe last verses, hence a1 a2 a3\\--b1 b2 b3\\--c1 c2 c3; the parivartini, or\nreverting mode, following the natural order, a1 b1 c1\\--a2 b2 c2\\--a3 b3 c3;\nand the kulayini, or web-like mode, performed in the order a1 b1 c1-b2 c2\na2\\--c3 a3 b3. Cf. Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p. 237, where, however, these forms\nare described quite differently. The term used for the natural order of verses\nin the parivartini vish _t_ uti is 'para _k_ i,' i.e. thitherwards, straight\noff. From the statement in [paragraph 7](sbe2649.htm#4:2:5:7) above, that\n'they chant straight off (parak),' one might therefore infer that that\nparticular mode of chanting ought to be used for the Bahishpavamana-stotra;\nbut the term 'parak' may also be taken as referring to each of the several\nverses being chanted 'straight off,' without any repetition. Haug, Transl.\nAit. Br. p. 120 note, remarks: 'Each of these verses is for the purpose of\nchanting divided into four parts: _Prast ava_, i, e. prelude, the first being\npreceded by _hum \xcc\x83_, to be sung by the Prastotar; _Udg itha_, the principal\npart of the Saman, preceded by _Om_ , to be chanted by the Udgatar; the\n_Pratih ara_, i.e. response [? rather check, stop; cf. [IV, 3, 4,\n22](sbe2653.htm#4:3:4:22)], introduced by _hum \xcc\x83_, to be chanted by the\nPratihartar; and the _Nidhana_ , i.e. finale, to be sung by all three. To give\nthe student an idea of this division, I here subjoin the second of these _ri_\n_k_ as in the Saman form, distinguishing its four parts:--\n\n[The connected _ri_ _k_ form is: Abhi te madhuna payo--atharva _n_ o a _s_ i\n_s_ rayur--deva _m_ devaya devayu.]\n\n' _Prast ava:_ abhi te madhuna payo _m_.\n\n' _Udg itha:_ om atharva _n_ o a _s_ i _s_ radeyurva _m_ devayada. p. 311\n\n' _Pratih ara:_ hu _m_ avayo.\n\n' _Nidhana:_ sam.\n\nThe Nidhanas, i.e. finales, are for the nine Pavamana-stotra verses the\nfollowing ones: sat, sam, suva _h_ , i _d_ a, vak, and a (for the four last\nverses).' See also Burnell, \xc3\x82rsheyabr. p. xlv seq.\n\n[311:1](sbe2649.htm#fr_751) La _t_ y. I, 12; II, 1; Ta _n_ _d_ ya Br. VI, 7\nseq. give the following details: The Prastot _ri_ takes the prastara (bunch of\ngrass, representing the Sacrificer) from the Adhvaryu and says, 'Brahman, we\nwill chant, O Pra _s_ astar!' The Brahman and Maitravaru _n_ a having given\ntheir assent (\xc3\x82 _s_ v. V, 2, 12-14). the Prastot _ri_ hands the prastara to\nthe Udgat _ri_. The latter touches his right thigh with it (or bends his right\nknee thereon) and 'harnesses' (introduces) the chant by the formula, 'with\nAgni's fire, with Indra's might, with Surya's brilliance, may B _ri_ haspati\nharness thee,' &c. (Ta _n_ _d_ ya Br. I, 3, 5); whereupon he mutters, 'I will\nmake food,' &c. (ib. 6); and after looking towards the pit and a vessel of\nwater and the sun. he commences the chant. The three chanters are seated west\nof the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasthat _ri_ (who look towards them), viz. the Udgat\n_ri_ facing the north, the Prastot _ri_ the west, and the Pratihart _ri_ the\nsouth (or south-east). To the west of them are seated three, four, or six\nsubordinate singers, or choristers (upagat _ri_ ), who accompany the chanting\nin a deep voice with the sound 'Ho.' When the chant is completed, the Udgat\n_ri_ says, 'I have made food,' and makes the sacrificer mutter the formula,\n'Thou art a falcon,' &c. (Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_. Br. I, 3, 8); whereupon he takes a stalk\nof grass from the prastara, cuts off the top and bottom, so as to make it of\nthe length of four thumbs' breadths, and throws it into the pit with, 'If it\nhas been chanted,' &c. (ib. II, 1, 8). They then pour out the vessel of water\ninto the pit, with, 'I send you to the sea,' &c., and make 3, 5, 7 or 9 steps\nnorthwards outside the altar, p. 312 whereupon they betake themselves to the\n\xc3\x82gnidhriya. During the chanting, the Unnet _ri_ pours the Soma-juice from the\n\xc3\x82dhavaniya trough through the strainer into the Putabh _ri_ t.\n\n[312:1](sbe2649.htm#fr_752) The Agnidh takes burning coals from the \xc3\x82gnidhriya\nfire, and puts them on the dhish _n_ ya hearths, in the order in which they\nwere raised.

VII, 11) from the Dro _n_ a-kala _s_ a or the Putabh\n_ri_ t, he makes the sacrificer eye the several cups and Soma vessels, as set\nforth [IV, 5, 6, 1](sbe2665.htm#4:5:6:1) seq.; the \xc3\x82 _s_ vina being looked at\nsixth in order (or fourth of the grahas), not tenth (as was its order of\ndrawing).

Hail to\nSarasvati!' the second with, 'May the holy Sarasvati, of abundant powers, rich\nin devotion, accept favourably our sacrifice!'

Br. I, 5, 11 assigns them to the A _s_\nvins, for the reason that they performed cures therewith.\n\n[315:5](sbe2649.htm#fr_765) These five sacrificial dishes, called savaniya _h_\n(or aindra _h_ ) puro _d_ a _s_ a _h_ , are placed together in one vessel\n(patri)--the puro _d_ a _s_ a proper, or rice-cake to Indra, being placed in\nthe centre--and oblations are made from them to the respective deities at one\nand the same time, two pieces being cut from each dish into the _g_ uhu for\nthe chief offering, and one piece from each into the upabh _ri_ t p. 316\nspoon, for the svish _t_ ak _ri_ t. While cutting the portion he calls on the\nMaitravaru _n_ a to 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) of the cakes of the\nmorning feast for Indra!' The anuvakya (Rig-veda III, 52, 1) having been\nrecited by the Maitravaru _n_ a, the Adhvaryu steps to the fire, calls on the\n\xc3\x82gnidhra for the _S_ rausha _t_ formula (see I, 5, 2, 16, with note), and\nthereupon on the Maitravaru _n_ a to Urge the cakes of the morning feast\nbrought forward for Indra!' That priest then urges, 'Let the Hot _ri_\npronounce the offering prayer to Indra! May Indra with his bays eat the grain!\n[O Hotar, pronounce the offering prayer!]' Whereupon the Hot _ri_ recites, We\nwho worship (part i, p. 142, note),--May Indra with his bays eat the grains,\nwith Pushan the porridge; with Sarasvati, with Bharati, the sour curds, with\nMitra and Varu _n_ a the clotted curds! [cf. Ait. Br. II, 24; Taitt. Br. I, 5,\n11; \xc3\x82 _s_ v. V, 4, 3] Vausha _t_!' when the Adhvaryu pours the oblation into\nthe fire. For the oblation to Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t the invitatory prayer\nis Rig-Veda III, 28, 1, and the offering formula 'Havir agne vihi,'\n'graciously accept the offering, O Agni!'
