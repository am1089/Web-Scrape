IV.\n\nAccount of kings, divisions, mountains, rivers, and inhabitants of the other\nDwipas, viz. Plaksha, \xc5\x9aalmala, Ku\xc5\x9ba, Krauncha, \xc5\x9aaka, and Pushkara: of the\noceans separating them: of the tides: of the confines of the earth: the\nLokaloka mountain. Extent of the whole.\n\nIN the same manner as Jambu-dwipa is girt round about by the ocean of salt\nwater, so that ocean is surrounded by the insular continent of Plaksha; the\nextent of which is twice that of Jambu-dwipa.\n\nMedhatithi, who was made sovereign of Plaksha, had seven sons, \xc5\x9aantabhaya,\n\xc5\x9ai\xc5\x9bira, Sukhodaya, \xc3\x81nanda, \xc5\x9aiva, Kshemaka, and Dhruva; and the Dwipa was\ndivided amongst them, and each division was named after the prince to whom it\nwas subject. The several kingdoms were bounded by as many ranges of mountains,\nnamed severally Gomeda, Chandra, Narada, Dundubhi, Somaka, Sumanas, and\nVaibhraja. In these mountains the sinless inhabitants ever dwell along with\ncelestial spirits and gods: in them are many holy places; and the people there\nlive for a long period, exempt from care and pain, and enjoying uninterrupted\nfelicity. There are also, in the seven divisions of Plaksha, seven rivers,\nflowing to the sea, whose names alone are sufficient to take away sin: they\nare the Anutapta, \xc5\x9aikhi, Vipasa, Tridiva, Kramu, Amrita, and Sukrita. These\nare the chief rivers and mountains of Plaksha-dwipa, which I have enumerated\nto you; but there are thousands of others of inferior magnitude. The people\nwho drink of the waters of those rivers are always contented and happy, and\nthere is neither decrease nor increase amongst them 1, neither are the\nrevolutions of the four ages known in these Varshas: the character of the time\nis there uniformly that of\n\np. 198\n\nthe Treta (or silver) age. In the five Dwipas, worthy Brahman, from Plaksha to\n\xc5\x9aaka, the length of life is five thousand years, and religious merit is\ndivided amongst the several castes and orders of the people. The castes are\ncalled \xc3\x81ryaka, Kuru, Vivasa, and Bhavi, corresponding severally with Brahman,\nKshetriya, Vai\xc5\x9bya, and \xc5\x9audra. In this Dwipa is a large fig-tree (F.\nreligiosa), of similar size as the Jambu-tree of Jambu-dwipa; and this Dwipa\nis called Plaksha, after the name of the tree. Hari, who is all, and the\ncreator of all, is worshipped in this continent in the form of Soma (the\nmoon). Plaksha-dwipa is surrounded, as by a disc, by the sea of molasses, of\nthe same extent as the land. Such, Maitreya, is a brief description of\nPlaksha-dwipa.\n\nThe hero Vapushmat was king of the next or \xc5\x9aalmala-dwipa, whose seven sons\nalso gave designations to seven Varshas, or divisions. Their names were \xc5\x9aweta,\nHarita, Jimuta, Rohita, Vaidyuta, Manasa, and Suprabha. The Ikshu sea is\nencompassed by the continent of Salmala, which is twice its extent. There are\nseven principal mountain ranges, abounding in precious gems, and dividing the\nVarshas from each other; and there are also seven chief rivers. The mountains\nare called Kumuda, Unnata, Valahaka, Drona, fertile in medicinal herbs, Kanka,\nMahisha, and Kakkudwat. The rivers are Yauni, Toya, Vitrishn\xcc\x81a, Chandra,\n\xc5\x9aukla, Vimochani, and Nivritti; all whose waters cleanse away sins. The\nBrahmans, Kshetriyas, Vai\xc5\x9byas, and \xc5\x9audras of this Dwipa, called severally\nKapilas, Arunas, Pitas, and Rohitas (or tawny, purple, yellow, and red),\nworship the imperishable soul of all things, Vishn\xcc\x81u, in the form of Vayu\n(wind), with pious rites, and enjoy frequent association with the gods. A\nlarge \xc5\x9aalmali (silk-cotton) tree grows in this Dwipa, and gives it its name.\nThe Dwipa is surrounded by the Sura sea (sea of wine), of the same extent as\nitself.\n\nThe Sura sea is entirely encircled by Ku\xc5\x9ba-dwipa, which is every way twice the\nsize of the preceding continent. The king, Jyotishmat, had seven sons,\nUdbhida, Venuman, Swairatha, Lavana, Dhriti, Prabhakara, and Kapila, after\nwhom the seven portions or Varshas of the island were called Udbhida, &c.\nThere reside mankind along with Daityas and Danavas, as well as with spirits\nof heaven and gods. The four\n\np. 199\n\ncastes, assiduously devoted to their respective duties, are termed Damis,\n\xc5\x9aushmis, Snehas, and Mandehas, who, in order to be relieved of the obligations\nimposed upon them in the discharge of their several functions, worship\nJanarddana, in the form of Brahma, and thus get rid of the unpleasant duties\nwhich lead to temporal rewards. The seven principal mountains in this Dwipa\nare named Vidruma, Hema\xc5\x9baila, Dyutiman, Pushpavan, Ku\xc5\x9be\xc5\x9baya, Hari, and\nMandara; and the seven rivers are Dhutapapa, \xc5\x9aiva, Pavitra, Sammati,\nVidyudambha, Mahhvanya, Sarvapapahara: besides these, there are numerous\nrivers and mountains of less importance. Ku\xc5\x9ba-dwipa is so named from a clump\nof Ku\xc5\x9ba grass (Poa) growing there. It is surrounded by the Ghrita sea (the sea\nof butter), of the same size as the continent.\n\nThe sea of Ghrita is encompassed by Krauncha-dwipa, which is twice as large as\nKu\xc5\x9ba-dwipa. The king of this Dwipa was Dyutiman, whose sons, and the seven\nVarshas named after them, were Ku\xc5\x9bala, Mallaga, Ushn\xcc\x81a, Pivara, Andhakaraka,\nMuni, and Dundubhi. The seven boundary mountains, pleasing to gods and\ncelestial spirits, are Krauncha, Vamana, Andhakaraka, Devavrit,\nPun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81arikavan, Dundubhi, and Maha\xc5\x9baila; each of which is in succession twice\nas lofty as the series that precedes it, in the same manner as each Dwipa is\ntwice as extensive as the one before it. The inhabitants reside there without\napprehension, associating with the bands of divinities. The Brahmans are\ncalled Pushkaras; the Kshetriyas, Pushkalas: the Vai\xc5\x9byas are termed Dhanyas;\nand the \xc5\x9audras, Tishyas. They drink of countless streams, of which the\nprincipal are denominated Gauri, Kumudwati, Sandhya, Ratri, Manojava, Kshanti,\nand Pun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81arika. The divine Vishn\xcc\x81u, the protector of mankind, is worshipped\nthere by the people, with holy rites, in the form of Rudra. Krauncha is\nsurrounded by the sea of curds, of a similar extent; and that again is\nencompassed by \xc5\x9aaka-dwipa.\n\nThe sons of Bhavya, the king of \xc5\x9aaka-dwipa, after whom its Varshas were\ndenominated, were Jalada, Kumara, Sukumara, Manichaka, Kusumoda, Maudaki, and\nMahadruma. The seven mountains separating the countries were Udayagiri,\nJaladhara, Raivataka, \xc5\x9ayama, \xc3\x81mbikeya, Ramya, and Ke\xc5\x9bari. There grows a large\nSaka (Teak) tree, frequented\n\np. 200\n\nby the Siddhas and Gandharbas, the wind from which, as produced by its\nfluttering leaves, diffuses delight. The sacred lands of this continent are\npeopled by the four castes. Its seven holy rivers, that wash away all sin, are\nthe Sukumari, Kumari, Nalini, Dhenuka, Ikshu, Venuka, and Gabhasti. There are\nalso hundreds and thousands of minor streams and mountains in this Dwipa: and\nthe inhabitants of Jalada and the other divisions drink of those waters with\npleasure, after they have returned to earth from Indra\'s heaven. In those\nseven districts there is no dereliction of virtue; there is no contention;\nthere is no deviation from rectitude. The caste of Mriga is that of the\nBrahman; the Magadha, of the Kshetriya; the Manasa, of the Vai\xc5\x9bya; and the\nMandaga of the \xc5\x9audra: and by these Vishn\xcc\x81u is devoutly worshipped as the sun,\nwith appropriate ceremonies. \xc5\x9aaka-dwipa is encircled by the sea of milk, as by\nan armlet, and the sea is of the same breadth as the continent which it\nembraces 2\n\nThe Kshiroda ocean (or sea of milk) is encompassed by the seventh Dwipa, or\nPushkara, which is twice the size of Saka-dwipa. Savana, who was made its\nsovereign, had but two sons, Mahavira and Dhataki, after whom the two Varshas\nof Pushkara were so named. These are divided by one mighty range of mountains,\ncalled Manasottara, which runs in a circular direction (forming an outer and\nan inner circle). This mountain is fifty thousand Yojanas in height, and as\nmany in its breadth; dividing the Dwipa in the middle, as if with a bracelet,\ninto two divisions, which are also of a circular form, like the mountain that\nseparates them. Of these two, the Mahavira-varsha is exterior to the\ncircumference of Manasottara, and Dhataki lies within the circle; and both are\nfrequented by heavenly spirits and gods. There are no other mountains in\nPushkara, neither are there any rivers 3. Men in this Dwipa live a thousand\nyears, free from sickness and sorrow, and unruffled by anger or affection.\n\np. 201\n\n[paragraph continues] There is neither virtue nor vice, killer nor slain:\nthere is no jealousy, envy, fear, hatred, covetousness, nor any moral defect:\nneither is there truth or falsehood. Food is spontaneously produced there, and\nall the inhabitants feed upon viands of every flavour. Men there are indeed of\nthe same nature with gods, and of the same form and habits. There is no\ndistinction of caste or order; there are no fixed institutes; nor are rites\nperformed for the sake of advantage. The three Vedas, the Puran\xcc\x81as, ethics,\nand polity, and the laws of service, are unknown. Pushkara is in fact, in both\nits divisions, a terrestrial paradise, where time yields happiness to all its\ninhabitants, who are exempt from sickness and decay. A Nyagrodha-tree (Ficus\nindica) grows on this Dwipa, which is the especial abode of Brahma, and he\nresides in it, adored by the gods and demons. Pushkara is surrounded by the\nsea of fresh water, which is of equal extent with the continent it invests 4.\n\nIn this manner the seven island continents are encompassed successively by the\nseven oceans, and each ocean and continent is respectively of twice the extent\nof that which precedes it. In all the oceans the water remains at all times\nthe same in quantity, and never, increases or diminishes; but like the water\nin a caldron, which, in consequence of\n\np. 202\n\nits combination with heat, expands, so the waters of the ocean swell with the\nincrease of the moon. The waters, although really neither more nor less,\ndilate or contract as the moon increases or wanes in the light and dark\nfortnights. The rise and fall of the waters of the different seas is five\nhundred and ten inches 5.\n\nBeyond the sea of fresh water is a region of twice its extent, where the land\nis of gold, and where no living beings reside. Thence extends the Lokaloka\nmountain, which is ten thousand Yojanas in breadth, and as many in height; and\nbeyond it perpetual darkness invests the mountain all around; which darkness\nis again encompassed by the shell of the egg 6.\n\nSuch, Maitreya, is the earth, which with its continents, mountains, oceans,\nand exterior shell, is fifty crores (five hundred millions) of\n\np. 203\n\n[paragraph continues] Yojanas in extent 7. It is the mother and nurse of all\ncreatures, the foundation of all worlds, and the chief of the elements.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[197:1](vp062.htm#fr_642) So the commentator explains the terms Avasarpin\xcc\x81i\nand Utsarpin\xcc\x81i; but these words most commonly designate divisions of time\npeculiar to the Jainas; during the former of which men are supposed to decline\nfrom extreme felicity to extreme distress; and in the latter, to ascend from\nmisery to happiness. The author of the text had possibly the Jaina use of\nthese terms in view; and if so, wrote after their system was promulgated.\n\n[200:2](vp062.htm#fr_643) The Kurma is the only Puran\xcc\x81a in which the white\nisland, \xc5\x9aweta-dwipa, the abode of Vishn\xcc\x81u, is included in the geography of the\nworld: an incidental description of it is quoted by Col. Wilford from the\nUttara Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a of the Padma Puran\xcc\x81a (As. Res. XI. 99); and it is in this and\nin the Brahma Vaivartta that allusions to it are most frequent and copious.\n\n[200:3](vp062.htm#fr_644) A slight alteration has been here made in the order\nof the description.\n\n[201:4](vp062.htm#fr_645) The description of the Dwipas in the Agni, Brahma,\nKurma, and Vayu Puran\xcc\x81as agrees with that of our text. The Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya,\nLinga, and Matsya contain no details. The Bhagavata and Padma follow the same\norder as the Vishn\xcc\x81u, &c. but alter all the names, and, many of the\nmeasurements. The account of the Mahabharata is very irregular and confused.\nThe variations throw no additional light upon the geographical system of the\nPuran\xcc\x81as. Some traces of this appear discoverable in the west; and the seven\nDwipas, with their surrounding seas, may have some connexion with the notion\nof the seven climates, as Col. Wilford has supposed. That learned, but\nfanciful writer bestowed great pains upon the verification of these fictions,\nand imagined the different Dwipas to represent actual divisions of the globe:\nJambu being India; Ku\xc5\x9ba, the Kush of Scripture, or the countries between\nMesopotamia and India: Plaksha being Asia Minor; \xc5\x9aalmali, eastern Europe;\nKrauncha, Germany; \xc5\x9aaka, the British isles; and Pushkara, Iceland. The white\nor silver island, or island of the moon, was also, according to him, the\nisland of Great Britain. Whatever may be thought of his conclusions, his\nessays on these subjects, particularly in the eighth, tenth, and eleventh\nvolumes of the Asiatic Researches, contain much curious and interesting\nmatter.\n\n[202:5](vp062.htm#fr_646) Although the Hindus seem to have had a notion of the\ncause of the tides, they were not very accurate observers of the effect. The\nextreme rise of the tide in the Hugli river has never exceeded twenty feet,\nand its average is about fifteen. (As. Res. vol. XVIII. Kyd on the Tides of\nthe Hugli.)\n\n[202:6](vp062.htm#fr_647) The An\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a kat\xcc\x81aha. The Kat\xcc\x81aha is properly a\nshallow hemispherical vessel, a saucer; but compounded in this form, implies\nthe shell of the mundane egg. The Bhagavata thus describes these portions of\nthe world: "Beyond the sea of fresh water is the mountain belt, called\nLokaloka, the circular boundary between the world and void space. The interval\nbetween Meru and Manasottara is the land of living beings. Beyond the fresh\nwater sea is the region of gold, which shines like the bright surface of a\nmirror, but from which no sensible object presented to it is ever reflected,\nand consequently it is avoided by living creatures. The mountain range by\nwhich it is encircled is termed Lokaloka, because the world is separated by it\nfrom that which is not world; for which purpose it was placed by \xc3\x8d\xc5\x9bwara on the\nlimit of the three worlds; and its height and breadth are such that the rays\nof the heavenly luminaries, from the sun to the polar-star, which spread over\nthe regions within the mountain, cannot penetrate beyond it." According to\nCol. Wilford, however, there is a chasm in the belt, and a sea beyond it,\nwhere Vishn\xcc\x81u abides; but he has not given his authorities for this. (As. Res.\nXI. 54.) The Mohammedan legends of Koh Kaf, \'the stony girdle that surrounds\nthe world,\' are evidently connected with the Lokaloka of the Hindus. According\nto the \xc5\x9aiva Tantra, the El Dorado, at the foot of the Lokaloka mountains, is\nthe play-ground of the gods.\n\n[203:7](vp062.htm#fr_648) This comprises the planetary spheres; for the\ndiameter of the seven zones and oceans--each ocean being of the same diameter\nas the continent it encloses, and each successive continent being twice the\ndiameter of that which precedes it--amounts to but two crones and fifty-four\nlacs. The golden land is twice the diameter of Pushkara, or two crones and\nfifty-six lacs; and the Lokaloka is but ten thousand Yojanas. So that the\nwhole is five crores ten lacs and ten thousand (5.10.10.000). According to the\n\xc5\x9aiva Tantra, the golden land is ten crores of Yojanas, making, with the seven\ncontinents, one fourth of the whole measurement. Other calculations occur, the\nincompatibility of which is said by the commentators on our text, and on that\nof the Bhagavata, to arise from reference being made to different Kalpas, and\nthey quote the same stanza to this effect: \'Whenever any contradictions in\ndifferent Puran\xcc\x81as are observed, they are ascribed by the pious to differences\nof Kalpas and the like.\'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter V](vp063.htm)\n\n'
