They truly [1](sbe3241.htm#an_5:59:1:1) tried to make you grant them\nwelfare. Do thou sing [2](sbe3241.htm#an_5:59:1:2) praises to Heaven (Dyu), I\noffer sacrifice ( _ri_ ta) to the Earth. The Maruts wash their horses and race\nto the air, they soften their splendour by waving mists.\n\n2\\. The earth trembles with fear from their onset. She sways like a full ship,\nthat goes rolling [1](sbe3241.htm#an_5:59:2:1). The heroes who appear on their\nmarches, visible from afar, strive together within the great (sacrificial)\nassembly [2](sbe3241.htm#an_5:59:2:2).\n\n3\\. Your horn is exalted for glory [1](sbe3241.htm#an_5:59:3:1), as the horns\nof cows; your eye is like the sun [2](sbe3241.htm#an_5:59:3:2), when the mist\nis scattered. Like strong racers, you are beautiful, O heroes, you think of\nglory, like manly youths [3](sbe3241.htm#an_5:59:3:3).\n\n4\\. Who could reach, O Maruts, the great wise thoughts, who the great manly\ndeeds of you, great ones? You shake the earth like a speck of dust, when you\nare carried forth for granting welfare.\n\n5\\. These kinsmen [1](sbe3241.htm#an_5:59:5:1) (the Maruts) are like red\nhorses, like heroes eager for battle, and they have rushed forward to fight.\nThey are like well-grown manly youths, and the men have grown strong, with\nstreams of rain they dim the eye of the sun.\n\n6\\. At their outbreak there is none among them who is the eldest, or the\nyoungest, or the middle: they have grown by their own might, these sons of P\n_ri_ _s_ ni, noble by birth, the boys of Dyaus; come hither to us!\n\np. 348\n\n7\\. Those who like birds flew with strength in rows\n[1](sbe3241.htm#an_5:59:7:1) from the ridge of the mighty heaven to its ends,\ntheir horses shook the springs [2](sbe3241.htm#an_5:59:7:2) of the mountain\n(cloud) so that people on both sides [3](sbe3241.htm#an_5:59:7:3) knew it.\n\n8\\. May [1](sbe3241.htm#an_5:59:8:1) Dyaus Aditi (the unbounded)\n[2](sbe3241.htm#an_5:59:8:2) roar for our feast, may the dew-lighted Dawns\ncome striving together; these, the Maruts, O poet, (the sons) of Rudra, have\nshaken the heavenly bucket (cloud), when they had been praised.\n\np. 349\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same poet and deity. Metre, 1-7 _G_ agati; 8 Trish _t_ ubh. None of the\nverses occurs in SV., VS., AV., TB., TS., MS.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. If we accept the text as it stands, we have to translate, 'The spy\ncalled out to you to grant welfare.' The spy is then either Agni (Bergaigne,\nII, p. 378) or the priest. See also VIII, 61, 15; X, 35, 8. But there are many\nobjections to this. Pra-krand is not used in that sense, and we should expect\npra krant suvitaya. Pra-kar, when it is construed with a dative, means\ngenerally to prepare some one for something, to cause some one to do a thing.\nThus, I, 186, 10. pro a _s_ vinau avase k _ri_ _n_ udhvam. get the A _s_ vins\nto protect. VI, 21, 9. pra utaye varu _n_ am mitram indram maruta _h_ k _ri_\nshva avase na _h_ adya, make Varu _n_ a, Mitra, and Indra to protect, make the\nMaruts to protect us to-day. X, 64, 7. pra va _h_ vayum--stomai _h_ k _ri_ _n_\nudhvam sakhya\xc2\xb4ya pusha _n_ am, make Vayu by your praises to be your friend. I,\n112, 8. pra andham _s_ ro _n_ am _k_ akshase etaye k _ri_ tha _h_ , whereby\nyou make the blind and lame to see and to walk. The poet therefore seems to\nhave said in our verse also, 'They (my men or priests) made you or wished you\nto give them welfare.' What spa _t_ can mean in such a sentence, is difficult\nto say. Till we know better, we must simply accept it as a particle of\nasseveration, like ba _t_.\n\nNote 2. \xc3\x81r _k_ a may also be the first person.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. With regard to vyathir yati\xc2\xb4, cf. I, 117, 15. samudram avyathir _g_\naganva\xc2\xb4n, and VIII, 45, 19. vyathir _g_ aganva\xc2\xb4 _m_ sa _h_ ; Bergaigne, Journ.\nAs. 1884, p. 490.\n\nNote 2. Mahe vidathe must be taken as a locative sing. It occurs again X, 96,\n1. We have similar forms in mahe ra _n_ e, IX, 66, 13. &c. The locative is\ngoverned by anta _h_ ,\n\np. 350\n\nas in II, 27, 8. vidathe anta _h_ esham. The etymology and the meaning of\nvidatha have been often discussed, for the last time by M. Regnaud, Revue de\nl'histoire des religions, 1890. Prof. Roth, as M. Regnaud states, explains it\nby conseil, avis, reunion ou l'on delibere, assemblee, troupe, armee.\nGrassmann takes it generally for reunion, rencontre, combat. Geldner derives\nit from vid, in the sense of art, science. Ludwig derives it likewise from\nvid, but in the sense .of Bekanntschaft, then Gesellschaft, and lastly as\nsynonymous with ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, sacrifice, assemblage. M. Regnaud differs from\nall his predecessors, and derives vidatha from vidh, to sacrifice. He\nmaintains that *vidhatha would become vidatha, like adhak from dah or dhagh,\nand phaliga for parigha. I know nothing about the etymology of phaliga, but if\nit stands for parigha, the second aspirate has lost its aspiration and thrown\nit on the initial. In adhak, the final has lost its aspiration, and thus\nallowed its appearance in the initial. But in vidatha, if it stood for\nvidhatha, there would be no phonetic excuse whatever for changing dh into d,\nat least in Sanskrit. It is possible that in Sanskrit such a form as vidhatha\nmight have been avoided, but there is no phonetic law to prevent the formation\nof such a word as vidhatha, like u _k_ atha, ya _g_ atha, &c. We say vidhatha\nin the 2 pers. plur., as we say bodhatha. No Sanskrit grammarian could derive\nvidatha from vidh. If therefore vidatha signifies sacrifice, this is not\nbecause it is derived from vidh, to sacrifice. Vidatha may have been the name\nof a sacred act, as veda is of sacred knowledge. But the fact remains that it\nis best translated by assembly, particularly an assembly for sacrificial\npurposes.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. On _s_ riyase, see I, 87, 6.\n\nNote 2. I see no necessity for changing surya _h_ into sura _h_ , see\nBergaigne, Melanges Renier, p. 94. He would translate, 'they are like the eye\nof the sun.'\n\nNote 3. Marya _h_ may be bridegrooms, as in V, 60, 4\n\np. 351\n\n[paragraph continues] (vara\xc2\xb4 _h_ iva), but there is nothing to indicate that\nmeaning here. The difficulty is to find a word to express _s_ riyase. It means\nto shine, but at the same time to excel. Possibly it may have even a more\ndefinite meaning, such as to shine in battle, or to triumph.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. As to sabandhu, see VIII, 20, 21.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. On sre _n_ i _h_ , see Gaedicke, p. 164; Bergaigne, Mel. Renier, p.\n94.\n\nNote 2. The meaning of nabhanu, spring, is doubtful.\n\nNote 3. Ubhaye refers to many on both sides, and cannot be taken for ubhe,\nheaven and earth. It may mean all, particularly when there are two sides only,\nas in a battle.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. Ludwig seems to have seen the true meaning of this verse, namely that,\nthough Dyaus may roar for the feast, and though the Dawns may strive to come\nnear, the Maruts alone deserve the sacrifice, because they opened the chest of\nrain.\n\nNote 2. On Dyaus Aditi, see note to I, 166, 12, [p.\n261](sbe3227.htm#page_261), where the translation has to be corrected.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 60. To Agni and the Maruts](sbe3242.htm)\n\n"
