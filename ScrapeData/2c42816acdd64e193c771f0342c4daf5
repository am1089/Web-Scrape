(The statement as to Brahman having size) subserves the purpose of the\nmind; in the manner of the four feet (quarters).\n\nIn reply to the purvapakshin's contention that the statements as to Brahman's\nsize, prove that there exists something different from Brahman, we remark that\nthose statements merely serve the purposes of the mind, i.e. of devout\nmeditation.--But how can the cognition of something consisting\n\np. 178\n\nof four, or eight, or sixteen parts be referred to Brahman?--Through its\nmodifications (effects), we reply, Brahman is assumed to be subject to\nmeasure. For as some men are of inferior, others of middling, others again of\nsuperior intelligence, not all are capable of fixing their mind on the\ninfinite Brahman, devoid of all effects. 'In the manner of the four feet,'\ni.e. in the same way as ( _Kh_. Up. III, 18), for the purpose of pious\nmeditation, speech and three other feet are ascribed to mind viewed as the\npersonal manifestation of Brahman, and fire and three other feet to the ether\nviewed as the cosmic manifestation of Brahman.--Or else the phrase, 'in the\nmanner of the four quarters,' may be explained as follows. In the same way as\nto facilitate commerce, a karshapa _n_ a is assumed to be divided into four\nparts--for there being no fixed rule as to the value of bargains, people\ncannot always carry on their transactions with whole karshapa _n_ as only--,\n(so, in order to facilitate pious meditation on the part of less intelligent\npeople, four feet, &c., are ascribed to Brahman).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2, 34](sbe38137.htm)\n\n"
