Now is the time to set sail towards that great confluence, where\nthe river of love meets the sea of worship. In that pure blue all the weight\nof its muddiness sinks and disappears.\n\nI now fear nothing--neither myself, nor anybody else. I have passed through\nfire. What was inflammable has been burnt to ashes; what is left is deathless.\nI have dedicated myself to the feet of him, who has received all my sin into\nthe depths of his own pain.\n\nTonight we go to Calcutta. My inward troubles have so long prevented my\nlooking after my things. Now let me arrange and pack them.\n\nAfter a while I found my husband had come in and was taking a hand in the\npacking.\n\n"This won\'t do," I said. "Did you not promise me you would have a sleep?"\n\n"I might have made the promise," he replied, "but my sleep did not, and it was\nnowhere to be found."\n\n"No, no," I repeated, "this will never do. Lie down for a while, at least."\n\n"But how can you get through all this alone?"\n\n"Of course I can."\n\n"Well, you may boast of being able to do without me. But frankly I can\'t do\nwithout you. Even sleep refused to come to me, alone, in that room." Then he\nset to work again.\n\nBut there was an interruption, in the shape of a servant, who came and said\nthat Sandip Babu had called and had asked to be announced. I did not dare to\nask whom he wanted. The light of the sky seemed suddenly to be shut down, like\nthe leaves of a sensitive plant.\n\n"Come, Bimal," said my husband. "Let us go and hear what Sandip has to tell\nus. Since he has come back again, after taking his leave, he must have\nsomething special to say."\n\nI went, simply because it would have been still more embarrassing to stay.\nSandip was staring at a picture on the wall. As we entered he said: "You must\nbe wondering why the fellow has returned. But you know the ghost is never laid\ntill all the rites are complete." With these words he brought out of his\npocket something tied in his handkerchief, and laying it on the table, undid\nthe knot. It was those sovereigns.\n\n"Don\'t you mistake me, Nikhil," he said. "You must not imagine that the\ncontagion of your company has suddenly turned me honest; I am not the man to\ncome back in slobbering repentance to return ill-gotten money. But..."\n\nHe left his speech unfinished. After a pause he turned towards Nikhil, but\nsaid to me: "After all these days, Queen Bee, the ghost of compunction has\nfound an entry into my hitherto untroubled conscience. As I have to wrestle\nwith it every night, after my first sleep is over, I cannot call it a phantom\nof my imagination. There is no escape even for me till its debt is paid. Into\nthe hands of that spirit, therefore, let me make restitution. Goddess! From\nyou, alone, of all the world, I shall not be able to take away anything. I\nshall not be rid of you till I am destitute. Take these back!"\n\nHe took out at the same time the jewel-casket from under his tunic and put it\ndown, and then left us with hasty steps.\n\n"Listen to me, Sandip," my husband called after him.\n\n"I have not the time, Nikhil," said Sandip as he paused near the door. "The\nMussulmans, I am told, have taken me for an invaluable gem, and are conspiring\nto loot me and hide me away in their graveyard. But I feel that it is\nnecessary that I should live. I have just twenty-five minutes to catch the\nNorth-bound train. So, for the present, I must be gone. We shall have our talk\nout at the next convenient opportunity. lf you take my advice, don\'t you delay\nin getting away either. I salute you, Queen Bee, Queen of the bleeding hearts,\nQueen of desolation!"\n\nSandip then left almost at a run. I stood stock-still; I had never realized in\nsuch a manner before, how trivial, how paltry, this gold and these jewels\nwere. Only a short while ago I was so busy thinking what I should take with\nme, and how I should pack it. Now I felt that there was no need to take\nanything at all. To set out and go forth was the important thing.\n\nMy husband left his seat and came up and took me by the hand. "It is getting\nlate," he said. "There is not much time left to complete our preparations for\nthe journey."\n\nAt this point Chandranath Babu suddenly came in. Finding us both together, he\nfell back for a moment. Then he said, "Forgive me, my little mother, if I\nintrude. Nikhil, the Mussulmans are out of hand. They are looting Harish\nKundu\'s treasury. That does not so much matter. But what is intolerable is the\nviolence that is being done to the women of their house."\n\n"I am off," said my husband.\n\n"What can you do there?" I pleaded, as I held him by the hand. "Oh, sir," I\nappealed to his master. "Will you not tell him not to go?"\n\n"My little mother," he replied, "there is no time to do anything else."\n\n"Don\'t be alarmed, Bimal," said my husband, as he left us.\n\nWhen I went to the window I saw my husband galloping away on horseback, with\nnot a weapon in his hands.\n\nIn another minute the Bara Rani came running in. "What have you done, Chotie\ndarling," she cried. "How could you let him go?"\n\n"Call the Dewan at once," she said, turning to a servant.\n\nThe Ranis never appeared before the Dewan, but the Bara Rani had no thought\nthat day for appearances.\n\n"Send a mounted man to bring back the Maharaja at once," she said, as soon as\nthe Dewan came up.\n\n"We have all entreated him to stay, Rani Mother," said the Dewan, "but he\nrefused to turn back."\n\n"Send word to him that the Bara Rani is ill, that she is on her death-bed,"\ncried my sister-in-law wildly.\n\nWhen the Dewan had left she turned on me with a furious outburst. "Oh, you\nwitch, you ogress, you could not die yourself, but needs must send him to his\ndeath! ..."\n\nThe light of the day began to fade. The sun set behind the feathery foliage of\nthe blossoming _Sajna_ tree. I can see every different shade of that sunset\neven today. Two masses of cloud on either side of the sinking orb made it look\nlike a great bird with fiery-feathered wings outspread. It seemed to me that\nthis fateful day was taking its flight, to cross the ocean of night.\n\nIt became darker and darker. Like the flames of a distant village on fire,\nleaping up every now and then above the horizon, a distant din swelled up in\nrecurring waves into the darkness.\n\nThe bells of the evening worship rang out from our temple. I knew the Bara\nRani was sitting there, with palms joined in silent prayer. But I could not\nmove a step from the window.\n\nThe roads, the village beyond, and the still more distant fringe of trees,\ngrew more and more vague. The lake in our grounds looked up into the sky with\na dull lustre, like a blind man\'s eye. On the left the tower seemed to be\ncraning its neck to catch sight of something that was happening.\n\nThe sounds of night take on all manner of disguises. A twig snaps, and one\nthinks that somebody is running for his life. A door slams, and one feels it\nto be the sudden heart-thump of a startled world.\n\nLights would suddenly flicker under the shade of the distant trees, and then\ngo out again. Horses\' hoofs would clatter, now and again, only to turn out to\nbe riders leaving the palace gates.\n\nI continually had the feeling that, if only I could die, all this turmoil\nwould come to an end. So long as I was alive my sins would remain rampant,\nscattering destruction on every side. I remembered the pistol in my box. But\nmy feet refused to leave the window in quest of it. Was I not awaiting my\nfate?\n\nThe gong of the watch solemnly struck ten. A little later, groups of lights\nappeared in the distance and a great crowd wound its way, like some great\nserpent, along the roads in the darkness, towards the palace gates.\n\nThe Dewan rushed to the gate at the sound. Just then a rider came galloping\nin. "What\'s the news, Jata?" asked the Dewan.\n\n"Not good," was the reply.\n\nI could hear these words distinctly from my window. But something was next\nwhispered which I could not catch.\n\nThen came a palanquin, followed by a litter. The doctor was walking alongside\nthe palanquin.\n\n"What do you think, doctor?" asked the Dewan.\n\n"Can\'t say yet," the doctor replied. "The wound in the head is a serious one."\n\n"And Amulya Babu?"\n\n"He has a bullet through the heart. He is done for."\n\n'
