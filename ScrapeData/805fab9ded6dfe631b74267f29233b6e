Again, O mighty-armed, do thou listen to My supreme word, which I, wishing\nthy welfare, will tell thee who art delighted (to hear Me). 1\n\np. 220\n\n2\\. Neither the hosts of Devas, nor the great Rishis, know My origin, for in\nevery way I am the source of all the Devas and the great Rishis. 2\n\n3\\. He who knows Me, birthless and beginningless, the great Lord of worlds--\nhe, among mortals, is undeluded, he is freed from all sins. 3\n\np. 221\n\n4-5. Intellect, knowledge, non-delusion, forbearance, truth, restraint of the\nexternal senses, calmness of heart, happiness, misery, birth, death, fear, as\nwell as fearlessness, non-injury, evenness, contentment, austerity,\nbenevolence, good name, (as well as) ill-fame;--(these) different kinds of\nqualities of beings arise from Me alone. 4\n\np. 222\n\n6\\. The seven great Rishis as well as the four ancient Manus, possessed of\npowers like Me (due to their thoughts being fixed on Me), were born of (My)\nmind; from them are these creatures in the world. 6\n\n7\\. He who in reality knows these manifold manifestations of My being and\n(this) Yoga power of Mine, becomes established in the unshakable Yoga; there\nis no doubt about it. 7\n\np. 223\n\n8\\. l am the origin of all, from Me everything evolves;--thus thinking the\nwise worship Me with loving consciousness. 8\n\n9\\. With their minds wholly in Me, with their senses absorbed in Me,\nenlightening one another, and always speaking of Me, they are satisfied and\ndelighted. 9\n\np. 224\n\n10\\. To them, ever steadfast and serving Me with affection, I give that Buddhi\nYoga by which they come unto Me. 10\n\n11\\. Out of mere compassion for them,\n\np. 225\n\n[paragraph continues] I, abiding in their hearts, destroy the darkness (in\nthem) born of ignorance, by the luminous lamp of knowledge. 11\n\np. 226\n\nArjuna said:\n\n12-13. The Supreme Brahman, the Supreme Abode, the Supreme Purifier, art Thou.\nAll the Rishis, the Deva-Rishi Narada as well as Asita, Devala and Vyasa have\ndeclared Thee as the Eternal, the Self-luminous Purusha, the first Deva,\nBirth-less and All-pervading. So also Thou Thyself sayest to me.\n\n14\\. I regard all this that Thou sayest to me as true, O Keshava. Verily, O\nBhagavan, neither the Devas nor the Danavas know Thy manifestation. 14\n\np. 227\n\n15\\. Verily, Thou Thyself knowest Thyself by Thyself, O Purusha Supreme, O\nSource of beings, O Lord of beings, O Deva of Devas, O Ruler of the world.\n\n16\\. Thou shouldst indeed speak, without reserve, of Thy divine attributes by\nwhich, filling all these worlds, Thou existest. 16\n\np. 228\n\n17\\. How shall I, O Yogin, meditate ever to know Thee? In what things,\nBhagavan, art Thou to be thought of by me? 17\n\n18\\. Speak to me again in detail, Jnanardana, of Thy Yoga-powers and\nattributes; for I am never satiated in hearing the ambrosia (of Thy speech).\n18\n\np. 229\n\nThe Blessed Lord said:\n\n19\\. I shall speak to thee now, O best of the Kurus, of My divine attributes,\naccording to their prominence; there is no end to the particulars of My\nmanifestation. 19\n\n20\\. I am the Self, O Gudakesha, existent in the heart of all beings; I am the\n\np. 230\n\nbeginning, the middle, and also the end of all beings. 20\n\n21\\. Of the Adityas, I am Vishnu; of luminaries, the radiant Sun; of the\nwinds, I am Marichi; of the asterisms, the Moon.\n\n22\\.

And of the Rudras I am Sankara, of the Yakshas and Rakshasas the Lord of\nwealth (Kuvera), of the Vasus I am Pavaka, and of mountains, Meru am I.\n\n24\\. And of priests, O son of Pritha, know Me the chief, Brihaspati; of\ngenerals, I am Skanda; of bodies of water, I am the ocean.\n\np. 232\n\n25\\. Of the great Rishis I am Bhrigu; of words I am the one syllable "Om"; of\nYajnas I am the Yajna of Japa (silent repetition); of immovable things the\nHimalaya. 25\n\n26\\.

Know Me among horses as Uchchaisshravas, Amrita-born; of lordly elephants\nAiravata, and of men the king. 27\n\n28\\. Of weapons I am the thunderbolt, of cows I am Kamadhuk; I am the\nKandarpa, the cause of offspring; of serpents I am Vasuki.\n\np. 234\n\n29\\. And Ananta of snakes I am, I am Varuna of water-beings; and Aryaman of\nPitris I am, I am Yama of controllers.\n\n30\\. And Prahlada am I of Diti\'s progeny, of measurers I am Time; and of\nbeasts I am the lord of beasts, and Garuda of birds.\n\n31\\. Of purifiers I am the wind, Rama\n\np. 235\n\nof warriors am I; of fishes I am the shark, of streams I am Jahnavi (the\nGanges).\n\n32\\. Of manifestations I, am the beginning, the middle and also the end; of\nall knowledges I am the knowledge of the Self, and Vada of disputants. 32\n\np. 236\n\n33\\. Of letters the letter A am I, and Dvandva of all compounds; I alone am\nthe inexhaustible Time, I the Sustainer (by dispensing fruits of actions) All-\nformed. 33\n\n34\\. And I am the all-seizing Death, and the prosperity of those who are to be\nprosperous; of the feminine qualities (I am) Fame, Prosperity (or beauty),\nInspiration, Memory, Intelligence, Constancy and Forbearance.\n\np. 237\n\n35\\.

There is no end of My divine attributes, O scorcher of foes; but this is\na brief statement by Me of the particulars of My divine attributes.\n\n41\\. Whatever being there is great,\n\np. 240\n\nprosperous or powerful, that know thou to be a product of a part of My\nsplendour.\n\n42\\. Or what avails thee to know all this diversity, O Arjuna? (Know thou\nthis,. that) I exist, supporting this whole world by a portion of Myself.\n\n\n\nThe end of the tenth chapter, designated Glimpses of the Divine Glory.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[219:1](sbg15.htm#fr_223) _Supreme_ --as revealing the unsurpassed truth.\n\n[220:2](sbg15.htm#fr_224) _Prabhavam_ --higher origin (birth);--though\nbirthless, yet taking various manifestations of power.
