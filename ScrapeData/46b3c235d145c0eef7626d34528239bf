Now, therefore, the desire to know the sacred law for their welfare\n(should arise) in (initiated) men. 1\n\n2\\. He who knows and follows the (sacred law is called) a righteous man.\n\n3\\. He becomes most worthy of praise in this world and after death gains\nheaven. 3\n\n4\\. The sacred law has been settled by the revealed texts and by the tradition\n(of the sages).\n\n5\\. On failure of (rules given in) these (two sources) the practice of the _S_\nish _t_ as (has) authority.\n\n6\\. But he whose heart is free from desire (is called) a _S_ ish _t_ a.\n\n7\\. (Acts sanctioned by) the sacred law (are those) for which no (worldly)\ncause is perceptible. 7\n\np. 2\n\n8\\. The country of the \xc3\x82ryas (\xc3\x82ryavarta) lies to the east of the region where\n(the river Sarasvati) disappears, to the west of the Black-forest, to the\nnorth of the Paripatra (mountains), to the south of the Himalaya. 8\n\n9\\. (According to others it lies to the south of the Himalaya) and to the\nnorth of the Vindhya range (being limited east and west by the two oceans). 9\n\n10\\. Acts productive of spiritual merit, and customs which (are approved of)\nin that country, must be everywhere acknowledged (as authoritative);\n\n11\\. But not different ones, (i.e. those) of (countries where) laws opposed\n(to those of \xc3\x82ryavarta prevail). 11\n\np. 3\n\n12\\. Some (declare the country of the \xc3\x82ryas to be situated) between the\n(rivers) Ga\xe1\xb9\x85ga and Yamuna. 12\n\n13\\. Others (state as) an alternative, that spiritual pre-eminence (is found)\nas far as the black antelope grazes. 13\n\n14\\. Now the Bhallavins quote also (the following) verse in the Nidana: 14\n\n15\\. 'In the west the boundary-river, in the east 15\n\np. 4\n\nthe region where the sun rises,--as far as the black antelope wanders (between\nthese two limits), so far spiritual pre-eminence (is found).\n\n16\\. 'Those religious acts which men, deeply versed in the knowledge of the\nthree Vedas and acquainted with the sacred law, declare to be lawful, (are\nefficient) for purifying oneself and others.' 16\n\n17\\. Manu has declared that the (peculiar) laws of countries, castes, and\nfamilies (may be followed) in the absence of (rules of) the revealed texts. 17\n\n18\\. Sinful men are, he who sleeps at sunrise or at sunset, he who has\ndeformed nails or black teeth, he whose younger brother was married first, he\nwho married before his elder brother, the husband of a younger sister married\nbefore the elder, the husband of an elder sister whose younger sister was\nmarried first, he who extinguishes the sacred fires, (and) he who forgets the\nVeda through neglect of the daily recitation. 18\n\np. 5\n\n19\\. They state that there are five mortal sins. (mahapataka),\n\n20\\. (Viz. violating) a Guru's bed, drinking (the spirituous liquor called)\nsura, slaying a learned Brahma _n_ a, stealing the gold of a Brahma _n_ a, and\nassociating with outcasts, 20\n\n21\\. Either by (entering into) spiritual or matrimonial (connexion with them).\n21\n\n22\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'He who during a year\nassociates with an outcast becomes (likewise) an outcast; not by sacrificing\nfor him, by teaching him or by (forming) a matrimonial (alliance with him),\nbut by using the same carriage or seat.' 22\n\n23\\. A minor offence causing loss of caste (upapataka, is committed by him)\nwho (after beginning an Agnihotra sacrifice) forsakes the sacred fires, and by\nhim who offends a Guru, by an atheist, by him who takes his livelihood from\natheists, and by him who sells the Soma (plant). 23\n\n24\\. Three wives (are permitted) to a Brahma _n_ a according to the order of\nthe castes, two to a Kshatriya, one to a Vai _s_ ya and to a _S_ udra. 24\n\np. 6\n\n25\\. Some declare (that twice-born men may marry) even a female of the _S_\nudra caste, like those (other wives), without (the recitation of) Vedic texts.\n\n26\\. Let him not act thus. 26\n\n27\\. For in consequence of such (a marriage) the degradation of the family\ncertainly ensues, and after death the loss of heaven.\n\n28\\. There are six marriage-rites, 28\n\n29\\. (Viz.) that of Brahman (brahma), that of the gods (daiva), that of the\n_Ri_ shis (arsha), that of the Gandharvas (gandharva), that of the Kshatriyas\n(kshatra), and that of men (manusha).\n\n30\\. If the father, pouring out a libation of water, gives his (daughter) to a\nsuitor, that (is called) the Brahma-rite 30\n\n31\\. If (the father) gives his daughter, decking her with ornaments, to an\nofficiating priest, whilst a sacrifice is being performed, that is called the\nDaiva-rite. 31\n\n32\\. And (if the father gives his daughter) for a cow and a bull, (that is\ncalled) the \xc3\x82rsha-rite. 32\n\n33\\. If a lover takes a loving female of equal caste, that (is called) the\nGandharva-rite. 33\n\n34\\. If they forcibly abduct (a damsel), destroying (her relatives) by\nstrength (of arms), that (is called) the Kshatra-rite. 34\n\n35\\. If, after making a bargain (with the father, a 35\n\np. 7\n\nsuitor) marries (a damsel) purchased for money, that (is called) the Manusha-\nrite.\n\n36\\. The purchase (of a wife) is mentioned in the following passage of the\nVeda, 'Therefore one hundred (cows) besides a chariot should be given to the\nfather of the bride.' 36\n\n37\\. (It is stated) in (the following passage of) the _K_ aturmasyas, 'She\n(forsooth) who has been bought by her husband (commits sin, as) afterwards she\nunites herself with strangers.' 37\n\n38\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'Lost learning comes back;\nwhen the family is lost all is lost. Even a horse becomes estimable on account\nof its pedigree; therefore men marry wives descended from an (unblemished)\nfamily.\n\n39\\. The three (lower) castes shall live according to the teaching of the\nBrahma _n_ a. 39\n\np. 8\n\n40\\. The Brahma _n_ a shall declare their duties,\n\n41\\. And the king shall govern them accordingly.\n\n42\\. But a king who rules in accordance with the sacred law, may take the\nsixth part of the wealth (of his subjects), 42\n\n43\\. Except from Brahma _n_ as. 43\n\n44\\. It has been declared in the Veda, 'But he obtains the sixth part of (the\nmerit which Brahma _n_ as gain by) sacrifices and charitable works.' 44\n\n45\\. (It is further stated in the Veda), 'The Brahma _n_ a makes the Veda\nrich; the Brahma _n_ a saves from misfortune; therefore the Brahma _n_ a shall\nnot be made a source of subsistence. Soma is his king.' 45\n\n46\\. Further (another passage says), 'After death bliss (awaits the king who\ndoes not oppress Brahma _n_ as).'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1:1](sbe1404.htm#fr_56) **1**. The word 'now' serves, in this as in analogous\ncases, various purposes. It marks the beginning of the book, serves as an\nauspicious invocation (ma\xe1\xb9\x85gala), and indicates that something else, the\ninitiation, must precede the study of the sacred law. 'Therefore' means\n'because, after initiation, the neophyte is to be taught the prescribed rules\nregarding personal purification:--K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita. For the\nwording of the Sutra compare the be-ginning of _G_ aimini's Mima _m_ sa-\nsutras.\n\n[1:3](sbe1404.htm#fr_57)-6. Gautama I, 1-4; XXVIII, 48.\n\n[1:7](sbe1404.htm#fr_58) The Sutra contains a limitation of Sutra 5. It\nindicates that the customs of the _S_ ish _t_ as, for which worldly motives\nare perceptible, have no authority, and are not to be followed. The principle\nenunciated is one inculcated by the Mima _m_ sakas (P: M. S. p. 2 I, 3, 3-4).\nSee also \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 4, 5-10; I, 4, 12, 8; and Introduction, p. xxvii. K\n_ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita has misunderstood the Sutra. He reads, against the\nMSS., ag _ri_ hyama _n_ akara _n_ o 'dharma _h_ , 'unlawful acts are those for\nwhich no motive, i.e. no sacred source such as the Vedas, is perceptible.'\n\n[2:8](sbe1404.htm#fr_59) The region where the river Sarasvati disappears is\nthe Pattiala district in the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ab. The Paripatra mountains belong to\nthe great Vindhya range, and are probably the hills in Malva. The position of\nthe Kalakavana or Black-forest is not accurately known. But it must probably\nbe sought in Bihar. All the MSS. as well as K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita read\nin this Sutra pragadar _s_ anat instead of pragadar _s_ anat, 'to the east of\nthe region where the river Sarasvati disappears.' This circumstance gains some\nimportance by the fact that the Mahabhashya on Pa _n_ ini II, 4, 10, quotes\nthe same definition of the \xc3\x82ryavarta, giving, however, instead of adar _s_\nanat pragadar _s_ at, 'to the east of \xc3\x82dar _s_ a, i.e. the \xc3\x82dar _s_ a\nmountains.' It seems to me not improbable that our Sutra, too, had originally\npragadar _s_ at, and that some Pa _n_ _d_ it who knew nothing about the \xc3\x82dar\n_s_ a hills, but remembered Manu II, as, and Baudhayana I, 1, 25, where the\nword vina _s_ anat, 'the disappearance of the Sarasvati,' undoubtedly occurs,\nadded the syllable na and forgot to correct the a, after prag.\n\n[2:9](sbe1404.htm#fr_60) The translation follows K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_\nita's commentary, which recommends itself on account of the analogous\ndefinition of \xc3\x82ryavarta given by Manu II, 22.\n\n[2:11](sbe1404.htm#fr_61) My translation follows the text given by K _ri_ sh\n_n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita and p. 3 B., and the explanation of the former, because it\nseems to me that the general sense which they give, is the correct one. I\nfeel, however, not certain that the word. pratilomakadharma _n_ am, 'of those\ncountries where opposite laws prevail,' is more than a care less correction.\nThe majority of the MSS. read pratilomakakshadharma _n_ a _h_ (kalpadharma _n_\na _h_ ), which by itself is difficult of explanation. But, as the text of the\nnext Sutra contains an apparently superfluous phrase, I fear, we shall have to\nadmit that the text is here disfigured by corruptions, which with our present\nMSS. it is impossible to remove with certainty.\n\n[3:12](sbe1404.htm#fr_62) K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita reads this Sutra 'etad\naryavartam itya _k_ akshate ga\xe1\xb9\x85gayamunayor antaretyeke,' and takes it as one\nsentence, the subject of which is 'eke.' I feel no doubt that this explanation\nis utterly untenable, and that the first four words have nothing to do with\nthis Sutra, the second part of which occurs also in the Baudhayana Dharma-\nsutra I, 1, 27. My opinion is that they originally belonged to Sutra 11,\nthough the state of the MSS. at my disposal does not allow me to say how Sutra\n11 has to be corrected. The general sense of Sutra 12 is, however, perfectly\ncertain.\n\n[3:13](sbe1404.htm#fr_63) Manu II, 23; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 2. It deserves to\nbe noted that the black antelope (black-buck), Oryx cervicapra, selects for\nits home the well-cultivated, rich plains of India only, and is entirely\nwanting in the sandy, mountainous or forest districts, which are now, just as\nin ancient times, the portion of the aboriginal tribes.\n\n[3:14](sbe1404.htm#fr_64) Regarding the Bhallavins, see Max Muller, History of\nAncient Sanskrit Literature, pp. 193, 364. K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita\nthinks that Nidana means de _s_ anir _n_ aya, 'the disquisition on the\ncountries,' which is the title of a section which occurs in most modern\ncompilations on law. But it will be safer to take it as the name of a Vedic\nwork, identical with or similar to that quoted in _S_ aunaka's B _ri_\nhaddevata, Weber, Hist. Ind. Lit., p. 81.\n\n[3:15](sbe1404.htm#fr_65) Sindhur vidhara _n_ i or vidhara _n_ i, as B. reads,\ncannot be p. 4 taken with K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita, as 'the ocean,'\nbecause in the latter sense sindhu is a masculine. It must be a boundary-\nriver, probably the Sarasvati. By suryasyodana, 'the region where the sun\nrises,' the udayagiri or 'mountain of the east' may possibly be meant.\n\n[4:16](sbe1404.htm#fr_66) This verse, too, is marked as a quotation by the\nconcluding word iti, though it is not necessary that it should be taken as a\nquotation from the Nidana. Here, and in the sequel verses ending in iti are\nmarked as quotations by hyphens.\n\n[4:17](sbe1404.htm#fr_67) Manu VII, 203; VIII, 41; Gautama XI, 20. _G_ ati,'\ncastes,' which sometimes, and perhaps as appropriately, has been translated by\n'tribes,' denotes in my opinion those numerous subdivisions of the four great\nvar _n_ as, which we now find all over India, and which can be shown to have\nexisted for a very long time. Usually the word 'caste' is also applied to\nthem.\n\n[4:18](sbe1404.htm#fr_68) K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita explains viraha, 'he\nwho extinguishes the sacred fires,' by 'the destroyer of his sons or of his\nspiritual clients' p. 5 (ya _g_ amana); but the rules given below, XX, 11, and\nXXI, 27, in the section on penances, confirm the explanation given above.\n\n[5:20](sbe1404.htm#fr_69) Vish _n_ u XXXV, 1-2. Guru means here the father,\nsee below, XX, 15.\n\n[5:21](sbe1404.htm#fr_70) Vish _n_ u XXXV, 3-5. Spiritual connexion, i.e.\nbecoming the teacher or priest of an outcast, or his pupil or spiritual client\n(ya _g_ amana).\n\n[5:22](sbe1404.htm#fr_71) Identical with Manu XI, 181. It must be understood\nthat spiritual or matrimonial connexion with an outcast causes immediate\ndegradation, as Vish _n_ u states expressly.\n\n[5:23](sbe1404.htm#fr_72) Vish _n_ u XXXVII, 6, 31; Gautama XXI, 11. Regarding\nthe precise meaning of prati _g_ ahnuyat, 'offends,' see below, XXI, 27.\n\n[5:24](sbe1404.htm#fr_73)-25. Manu III, 13; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 57;\nParaskara G _ri_ hya-sutra I, 4, 8-11.\n\n[6:26](sbe1404.htm#fr_74)-27. Manu III, 14-19.\n\n[6:28](sbe1404.htm#fr_75) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 5, II, 17-20.\n\n[6:30](sbe1404.htm#fr_76) Vish _n_ u XXIV, 19; \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana G _ri_ hya-sutra\nI, 6, 1.\n\n[6:31](sbe1404.htm#fr_77) Vish _n_ u XXIV, 20; \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana G _ri_\nhya.-sutra I, 6, 2,\n\n[6:32](sbe1404.htm#fr_78) Vish _n_ u XXIV, 21; \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana G _ri_ hya-sutra\nI, 6, 3.\n\n[6:33](sbe1404.htm#fr_79) Vish _n_ u XXIV, 23; \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana G _ri_ hya-sutra\nI, 6, 5.\n\n[6:34](sbe1404.htm#fr_80) Vish _n_ u XXIV, 25; \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana G _ri_ hya-sutra\nI, 6, 8.\n\n[6:35](sbe1404.htm#fr_81) Vish _n_ u XXIV, 24; \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana G _ri_ hya-sutra\nI, 6, 6.\n\n[7:36](sbe1404.htm#fr_82) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana G _ri_ hya-sutra I, 14; Paraskara G\n_ri_ hya-sutra I, 8, 18; \xc3\x82pastamba II, 6, 13, 12. Though Vasish _th_ a's\nquotation is less complete than \xc3\x82pastamba's, still the following Sutras show\nthat he knew the conclusion of the passage, and does not take it as an\nauthority for the sale of a daughter.\n\n[7:37](sbe1404.htm#fr_83) K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita makes a mistake by\nconnecting the word ' _k_ aturmasyeshu' with the next Sutra. He is right in\nsaying that 'the _K_ aturmasyas' is the name of a book. It is, however, not a\nseparate work, but the ka _n_ _d_ a or section of a Vedic work treating of the\n_K_ aturmasya sacrifices (see Max Muller, Hist. Anc. Sansk. Lit., p. 355). The\nparticular work from which our quotation has been taken, is either the\nMaitraya _n_ iya Sa _m_ hita, or the Ka _th_ aka. For, as Dr. von Schroeder\ninforms me, Maitraya _n_ iya Sa _m_ hita I, 10, 11 reads 'an _ri_ ta _m_ va\nesha karoti ya patyu _h_ krita satyathanyai _s_ _k_ arati,' and the title of\nthe ka _n_ _d_ a is _K_ aturmasyani. Professor Weber, Ind. Stud. V, 407, has\nfound the same words in the _K_ aturmasya section of the Ka _th_ aka XXXVI, 5.\nIn the translation I have added the beginning of the passage which Vasish _th_\na omits, according to the Maitraya _n_ iya Sa _m_ hita.\n\n[7:39](sbe1404.htm#fr_84)-41. Gautama XI, 25-27.\n\n[8:42](sbe1404.htm#fr_85) Vish _n_ u III, 22-25. Though the ambiguous word\ndhana, 'wealth,' is used in the text, it seems not doubtful that Vasish _th_ a\nalludes to the land-tax, which generally consists of one sixth of the produce.\n\n[8:43](sbe1404.htm#fr_86) Vish _n_ u III, 26.\n\n[8:44](sbe1404.htm#fr_87) Vish _n_ u III, 27--28. Purta, 'the merit gained by\ncharitable works,' i.e. by planting trees, digging wells, and so forth. The\nwords 'iti ha,' placed at the end of the Sutra, indicate that it is a\nquotation, and that vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ayate, 'it is declared in the Veda,' has to be\nunderstood from Sutra 46. Gautama XI, 11, too, alleges that the rule is based\non a Vedic passage.\n\n[8:45](sbe1404.htm#fr_88) _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a V, 4, 2, 3. K _ri_ sh _n_\napa _n_ _d_ ita's division of the quotation into several Sutras is\nunnecessary. His explanation of anadya, which he takes to mean 'the first of\nall,' is wrong. He asserts that the Brahma _n_ a is said 'to make the Veda\nrich,' because by sacrificing and so forth he fulfils its object and protects\nit. But the phrase is probably corrupt. If it is said that Soma is the king of\nthe Brahma _n_ as, the object is to indicate that an earthly king is not their\nmaster, see Gautama XI, 1.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter II](sbe1405.htm)\n\n"
