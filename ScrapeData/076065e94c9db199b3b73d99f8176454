Vyasa said :--O King! They went to the forest and fixed their seats on\nthe slope of the Himalayan mountain and engaged them-\n\n\n\np. 696\n\n\n\nselves in repeating silently the seed Mantra of Maha Maya and thus practised\ntheir austerities. O King! One hundred thousand years passed in the meditation\nof the Para S\xc2\x92akti. The Devi, pleased, became visible to them. Her form was\nthree-eyed, and of the form of Existence, Intelligence and Bliss\n(Sachhidananda); She was filled with mercy. In Her one hand there was the\nnoose, in another hand, goad; in another hand there was the sign bidding her\ndevotees discard all fear, and in the other hand She was ready to offer boons.\nThe good-natured Munis, seeing this Form of the World Mother began to praise\nHer. \xc2\x93O Devi! Thou art existing separately in every gross body; we bow down to\nThee. Thou art existing wholly (cosmically) in all the gross bodies; we bow\ndown to Thee. O Parames\xc2\x92vari! Thou art existing separately in every subtle\nbody; we bow down to Thee; Thou art existing universally in all the subtle\nbodies; we bow down to Thee, Thou art existing separately in all the causal\nbodies wherein all the Linga Dehas (subtle bodies) are interwoven; we bow down\nto Thee. Thou art existing universally in all the causal bodies; we bow down\nto Thee. Thou art of the nature of the unchangeable Brahma, the receptacle of\nall the Jivas and thus residest in all the bodies; so we bow down to Thee.\nThou art of the nature of \xc3\x82tman, the Goal of all the beings; we bow again and\nspin to Thee.\xc2\x94 Thus the pure-natured Dak _s_ a and the other Munis praised Her\nwith voice, choked with feelings of intense devotion and bowed down to Her\nfeet. Then the Devi, pleased, spoke to them in a cuckoo voice. \xc2\x93O Highly\nFortunate Ones! I am ever ready to grant boons; so ask what you desire.\xc2\x94 O\nKing! Hearing thus, they asked that Hari and Hara both regain their former\nnatural states and be united respectively with their S\xc2\x92aktis, Lak _s_ mi and\nGauri. Dak _s_ a again asked :-- \xc2\x93O Devi! Let your birth be in my family. O\nMother! I will, no doubt, consider myself as having then realised the\nfulfilment of my life. So, O Parames\xc2\x92vari! Speak by Thy own mouth how Thy\nworship, Japam, meditation will be conducted as well the various fit places\nwhere they would be performed.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n13-16. The Devi said :-- \xc2\x93The insult shown towards my S\xc2\x92aktis has led to this\ncalamitous state of Hari and Hara. So they should not repeat such crime. Now,\nby My favour, they will regain their health and, of the two S\xc2\x92aktis, one will\nbe born in your family and the other will take Her birth in the K _s_ iroda\nSagara, the ocean of milk. Hari and Hara will get back their S\xc2\x92aktis, when I\nwill send them the chief Mantra. The chief Mantra of Mine is the said Mantra\nof Maya; this is always sweet to Me; so worship this Mantra and make Japam of\nthis. The Form that you are seeing before you, this is My Bhuvanes\xc2\x92vari form\n(that of the Goddess\n\n\n\np. 697\n\n\n\nof the Universe), or worship My Vira _t_ (cosmic) form; or Sachchidananda\nform. The whole world is my place of worship; so you can meditate on Me and\nworship Me always and in all places.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n17-23. Vyasa said :-- When the Bhuvanes\xc2\x92vari Devi living in the Ma _n_ i Dvipa\nthus giving Her reply, went away, Dak _s_ a and other Munis all went to Brahma\nand informed him with great earnestness of everything that happened. O King!\nThus Hari and Hara both became devoid of their haughtiness and got back their\nprevious natures by the Grace of the Supreme Deity and were thus enabled to\nperform their functions as before. Then, on a certain time, the Devi\nBhagavati, the Fiery Nature of the Para S\xc2\x92akti, took Her birth in the house of\nthe Prajapati Dak _s_ a. O King! Everywhere in the Trilokas, great festivities\nwere held. All the Devas became glad and showered flowers. The Dundubhis of\nthe Devas were sounded by the hands and made very grave sounds. The pure-\nminded saints were gladdened; the Sun\xc2\x92s rays looked purer and cleaner; the\nrivers were elated with joy and began to flow in their channels. When the\nWorld-auspicious Devi, the Destroyer of the birth and death of the Jivas took\nHer birth, everything looked propitious. The wise Munis named Her \xc2\x93Sati\xc2\x94 as\nShe was of the nature of Para Brahma and Truth Herself. The Prajapati Dak _s_\na handed over the Devi, who was before the S\xc2\x92akti of Mahadeva, to that Deva of\nthe Devas, Mahadeva. Due to the misfortune of Dak _s_ a, the daughter of Dak\n_s_ a burnt Herself in a blazing fire.\n\n\n\n24-25. Janamejaya said :-- \xc2\x93O Munis! You have made me now hear a very\ninauspicious word. How can such a great thing of the nature of the Highest\nIntelligence come to be burnt up in a fire! The mere recollecting of Whose\nName dispels the terrible danger of the burning up by the fire of Samsara, how\ncan She be burnt up by fire, I am extremely eager to hear; kindly describe\nthat to me in detail.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n26-37. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hear. I am describing to you the ancient history\nof the burning of Sati. Once on a time, the famous Ri _s_ i Durvasa went to\nthe bank of the river Jambu and saw the Devi there. There he remained with his\nsenses controlled and began to repeat silently the root Mantra of Maya. Then\nthe Goddess of the Immortals, the Bhagavati was pleased and gave the Muni a\nbeautiful garland as Her Prasada that was on Her neck, that emitted the sweet\nfragrance of Makaranda (juice of flowers; Jasamine). Whereon the bees were\nabout to cluster. The Mahar _s_ i took it quickly and placed it on his head.\nHe then hurriedly went to see the Mother to the place where Sati\xc2\x92s Father,\n\n\n\np. 698\n\n\n\nthe Prajapati Dak _s_ a was staying and bowed down to the feet of the Sati.\nThe Prajapati then asked him :-- \xc2\x93O Lord! Whose extraordinary garland is this?\nHow have you got this enchanting garland, rare to the mortals on this earth!\xc2\x94\nThe eloquent Mahar _s_ i Durvasa then spoke to him with tears of love flowing\nfrom his eyes :-- \xc2\x93O Prajapati! I have got this beautiful garland that has no\nequal, as the Prasada (favour) of the Devi.\xc2\x94 The Prajapati asked that garland\nthen from him. He, too, thinking that there was nothing in the three worlds\nthat cannot be given to the devotee of the S\xc2\x92akti, gave that garland to the\nPrajapati. He took that on his head; then placed it on the nice bed that was\nprepared in the bed-room of the couple. Being excited by the sweet fragrant\nsmell of that garland in the night, the Prajapati engaged in a sexual\nintercourse! O King! Due to that animal action, the bitter enmity arose in his\nmind towards S\xc2\x92ankara and His Sati. He then began to abuse S\xc2\x92iva. O King! For\nthat offence, the Sati resolved to quit her body that was born of Dak _s_ a,\nto preserve the prestige of the Sanatan Darma of devotion to Her Husband and\nburnt Her body by the fire arising out of Yoga.\n\n\n\n38\\. Janamejaya said :-- \xc2\x93O Muni! What did Maha Deva do, thus pained by the\nbereavement from His consort dearer than His life, when the Sati\xc2\x92s body was\nthus consumed.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n39-50. Vyasa said :-- O King! I am unable to describe what happened\nafterwards. O King! Out of the fire of anger of S\xc2\x92iva, the Pralaya seemed to\nthreaten the three worlds. Virabhadra came into existence with hosts of Bhadra\nKalis, ready to destroy the three worlds. Brahma and the other Devas took\nrefuge to S\xc2\x92ankara. Though Mahadeva lost everything on Sati\xc2\x92s departure, He,\nthe Ocean of Mercy, destroyed the sacrifice of Dak _s_ a, cut off his head and\ninstead placed the head of a goat, brought him back to life and thus made the\nGods free from all fears. He, the Deva of the Devas, then became very much\ndistressed and going to the place of sacrifice, began to weep in great sorrow.\nHe saw that the body of the Intelligent Sati was being burnt in the fire of\nthe Chita. He cried aloud :-- Oh my Sati! Oh My Sati! And taking Her body on\nHis neck, began to roam in different countries, like a mad man. Seeing that,\nBrahma and the other Devas became very anxious and Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u cut off\nthe body to pieces by His arrows. Wherever the parts fell, S\xc2\x92ankara remained\nthere in so many different forms. He then said to the Devas :-- Whoever will\nworship, with deep devotion in these places, the Bhagavati, will have nothing\nleft unattained. The Highest Mother will remain close to them there. The\npersons that will make Puras\xc2\x92chara _n_ a (the repetition) of the Mantrams,\nespecially the Maya Vija (the root Mantra of Maya), their Mantrams will\nbecome, no\n\n\n\np. 699\n\n\n\ndoubt, fructified and become incarnate. O King! Thus saying, the Mahadeva,\nbeing very much distressed for Sati\xc2\x92s departure, passed His time in those\nplaces, making Japam, Dhyanam and taking to Samadhi.\n\n\n\n51-52. Janamejaya said :-- Where, in what places the several parts of the Sati\nfell? What are the names of those Siddhapi _t_ has? And what is their number?\nKindly describe these in detail, O Great Muni! No doubt I will highly consider\nmyself blessed by hearing these words from your blessed mouth.\n\n\n\n53-102. Vyasa said :-- O King! I will now describe those Pithas (Sacred\nplaces), the mere hearing of which destroys all the sins of men. Hear. I\ndescribe duly those places where the persons desiring to get lordly powers and\nto attain success ought to worship and meditate on the Devi. O Maharaja!

She is celebrated as Aru _n_ dhati amongst the\nSatis, the chaste women and as Tilottama in the midst of the Ramas. Again this\nMahadevi of the nature of the Great Intelligence (Samvid) is always existent\nin the form of S\xc2\x92akti named Brahmakala in the hearts of all the embodied\nbeings. O Janamejaya! Thus I have mentioned to you the one hundred and eight\npithas (sacred places or seats of the Deity) and as many Devis. Thus are\nmentioned all the seats of the Devis and along with that, the chief places in\nIndia (the world). He who hears these excellent one hundred and eight names of\nthe Devi as well as Her seats, gets himself freed from all sins and goes to\nthe Loka of the Devi. O Janamejaya! His heart gets purified and is rendered\nblessed, no doubt, who duly makes jatra (sojourn) to all these seats of the\nDeity, performs S\xc2\x92raddhas, offers peace-offerings to the Pitris and worships\nwith the highest devotion the Goddess and asks frequently the pardon of the\nWorld Mother. O King! After worship, one should\n\n\n\np. 701\n\n\n\nfeed the Brahma _n_ as, well dressed virgins (Kumaris) and Va _t_ ukas with\ngood eatables. All the tribes whether they be Cha _nd_ alas, know them all to\nbe of the nature of the Devi and therefore they should be worshipped. Never\none is to accept any donation or gifts (Pratigrahas) in these seats of the\nDevi. The saintly persons should make Pura _s_ chara _n_ as (repeat the names\nof their own deities, attended with burnt offerings, oblations, etc.) of their\nown Mantrams with all their might in all these places and should never be\nmiserly in their expenses on this account. He who starts to these sacred\nplaces, with devoted hearts filled with love, finds his Pitris in the higher\nand greater Brahma Loka for one thousand Kalpas and he gets the highest\nknowledge, crosses the ocean of the world and becomes free. Many a people have\nattained success by repeating these one hundred and eight names of the Deity.\nAny place wherein are kept those names, embodied in a book, becomes free from\nsuch dangers as plague, cholera or any misapprehensions from planetary Deities\nand so forth. Nothing remains to be attained by these persons who repeat these\none hundred and eight names. That man, devoted to the Devi, certainly attains\nblessedness. That saintly person becomes of the nature of the Devi. The Devas\nbow down and worship him when they behold him! What then need be said that the\nsaints would worship him! The Pitris become pleased and get their good ends\nwhen these one hundred and eight names are read with devotion. These places\nare, as it were, Intelligence personified (Chinmaya) and places ready to yield\nfreedom from bondage. Therefore, O King! Intelligent men should take their\nshelter in these places. O King! Whatever secrets and other deeper secrets\nabout the Great Goddess you asked to know from me, I described to you. What\nmore do you want to hear. Say.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Thirtieth Chapter of the Seventh Book on the birth of Gauri, the\nseats of the Deity, and the distraction of S\xc2\x92iva in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri\nMad Devi Bhagavatam, of 18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\nNote :-- The number one hundred and eight is a holy number, got by taking the\nhalf of 216,000, the number of breaths inhaled by a child in the womb who\npromises to take the name of God at his every breath or by taking one-eighth\nof 864,000, the number of seconds in a day. The two zeros are then dropped.\nThus the number signifies the one who fulfils one\xc2\x92s promise.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 31](bk07ch31.htm)\n\n"
