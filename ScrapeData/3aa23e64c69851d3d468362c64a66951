And because from the independence (of the Pradhana) there would follow the\nnon-existence of what is different (from creation, i.e. of the pralaya\ncondition).\n\nThat the Pradhana which is not guided by an intelligent principle is not the\nuniversal cause is proved also by the fact that, if we ascribe to it a power\nfor change independent of the guidance of a Lord capable of realising all his\npurposes, it would follow that the pralaya state, which is different from the\nstate of creation, would not exist; while on the other hand the guidance of\nthe Pradhana by a Lord explains the alternating states of creation and pralaya\nas the effects of his purposes. Nor can the Sa _n_ khya retort that our view\ngives rise to similar difficulties in so far, namely, as the Lord, all whose\nwishes are eternally accomplished, who is free from all imperfection, &c. &c.,\ncannot be the originator of either creation or pralaya, and as the creation of\nan unequal world would lay him open to the\n\np. 487\n\ncharge of mercilessness. For, as explained before, even a being perfect and\ncomplete may enter on activity for the sake of sport; and as the reason for a\nparticular creation on the part of an all-knowing Lord may be his recognition\nof Prak _ri_ ti having reached a certain special state, it is the deeds of the\nindividual souls which bring about the inequalities in the new creation.--But\nif this is so, all difference of states is caused exclusively by the good and\nevil deeds of the individual souls; and what position remains then for a\nruling Lord? Prak _ri_ ti, impressed by the good and evil deeds of the souls,\nwill by herself modify herself on such lines as correspond to the deserts of\nthe individual souls; in the same way as we observe that food and drink, if\neither vitiated by poison or reinforced by medicinal herbs and juices, enter\ninto new states which render them the causes of either pleasure or pain. Hence\nall the differences between states of creation and pralaya, as also the\ninequalities among created beings such as gods, men, and so on. and finally\nthe souls reaching the condition of Release, may be credited to the Pradhana,\npossessing as it does the capability of modifying itself into all possible\nforms!--You do not, we reply, appear to know anything about the nature of good\nand evil works; for this is a matter to be learned from the _S_ astra. The _S_\nastra is constituted by the aggregate of words called Veda, which is handed on\nby an endless unbroken succession of pupils learning from qualified teachers,\nand raised above all suspicion of imperfections such as spring from mistake\nand the like. It is the Veda which gives information as to good and evil\ndeeds, the essence of which consists in their pleasing or displeasing the\nSupreme Person, and as to their results, viz. pleasure and pain, which depend\non the grace or wrath of the Lord. In agreement herewith the Drami _d_ a _k_\narya says, 'From the wish of giving rise to fruits they seek to please the\nSelf with works; he being pleased is able to bestow fruits, this is the\npurport of the _S_ astra.' Thus _S_ ruti also says, 'Sacrifices and pious\nworks which are performed in many forms, all that he bears (i.e. he takes to\nhimself); be the navel of the Universe' (Mahanar. Up. I, 6). And in the same\nspirit the Lord\n\np. 488\n\nhimself declares,'From whom there proceed all beings, by whom all this is\npervaded--worshipping him with the proper works man attains to perfection'\n(Bha. Gi. XVIII, 46); and 'These evil and malign haters, lowest of men, I hurl\nperpetually into transmigrations and into demoniac wombs' (Bha. Gi. XVI, 19).\nThe divine Supreme Person, all whose wishes are eternally fulfilled, who is\nall-knowing and the ruler of all, whose every purpose is immediately realised,\nhaving engaged in sport befitting his might and greatness and having settled\nthat work is of a twofold nature, such and such works being good and such and\nsuch being evil, and having bestowed on all individual souls bodies and sense-\norgans capacitating them for entering on such work and the power of ruling\nthose bodies and organs; and having himself entered into those souls as their\ninner Self abides within them, controlling them as an animating and cheering\nprinciple. The souls, on their side, endowed with all the powers imparted to\nthem by the Lord and with bodies and organs bestowed by him, and forming\nabodes in which he dwells, apply themselves on their own part, and in\naccordance with their own wishes, to works either good or evil. The Lord,\nthen, recognising him who performs good actions as one who obeys his commands,\nblesses him with piety, riches, worldly pleasures, and final release; while\nhim who transgresses his commands he causes to experience the opposites of all\nthese. There is thus no room whatever for objections founded on deficiency, on\nthe Lord's part, of independence in his dealings with men, and the like. Nor\ncan he be arraigned with being pitiless or merciless. For by pity we\nunderstand the inability, on somebody's part, to bear the pain of others,\ncoupled with a disregard of his own advantage. When pity has the effect of\nbringing about the transgression of law on the part of the pitying person, it\nis in no way to his credit; it rather implies the charge of unmanliness\n(weakness), and it is creditable to control and subdue it. For otherwise it\nwould follow that to subdue and chastise one's enemies is something to be\nblamed. What the Lord himself aims at is ever to increase happiness to the\nhighest degree, and to this end it is instrumental that\n\np. 489\n\nhe should reprove and reject the infinite and intolerable mass of sins which\naccumulates in the course of beginning and endless aeons, and thus check the\ntendency on the part of individual beings to transgress his laws. For thus he\nsays: 'To them ever devoted, worshipping me in love, I give that means of\nwisdom by which they attain to me. In mercy only to them, dwelling in their\nhearts, do I destroy the darkness born of ignorance with the brilliant light\nof knowledge' (Bha. Gi. X, 10, 11).--It thus remains a settled conclusion that\nthe Pradhana, which is not guided by an intelligent principle, cannot be the\ngeneral cause.--Here a further objection is raised. Although Prak _ri_ ti, as\nnot being ruled by an intelligent principle, is not capable of that kind of\nactivity which springs from effort, she may yet be capable of that kind of\nactivity which consists in mere transformation. For we observe parallel cases;\nthe grass and water e.g. which are consumed by a cow change on their own\naccount into milk. In the same way, then, Prak _ri_ ti may on her own account\ntransform herself into the world.--To this the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 4.
