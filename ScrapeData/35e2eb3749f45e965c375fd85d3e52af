The reason why he collects\nwater, is that--water being vigour--he thereby collects vigour, the essence of\ndie waters.\n\n5:3:4:22\\. In a vessel of udumbara wood,--the udumbara (ficus glomerata) being\nsustenance, (that is) food---for the obtainment of sustenance, food: hence in\nan udumbara vessel (he mixes the different liquids).\n\n5:3:4:33\\. He first takes (water) 1 from the (river) Sarasvati, with (Va _g_.\nS. X, i), 'The gods took honey-sweet water,'--whereby he says, 'the gods took\nwater full of essence;'--'sapful, deemed king-quickening,'--by 'sapful' he\nmeans to say, 'full of essence;' and by 'deemed king-quickening' he means to\nsay, '(water) which is recognised as king-quickening;'--'wherewith they\nanointed Mitra and Varu _n_ a,' for therewith they did anoint (sprinkle) Mitra\nand Varu _n_ a;--'wherewith they guided\n\np. 74\n\n[paragraph continues] Indra past his enemies,' for therewith they indeed\nguided Indra past the fiends, the Rakshas. Therewith he sprinkles him,--\nSarasvati being (the goddess of) Speech: it is with speech he thereby\nsprinkles him. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.\n\n5:3:4:44\\. Thereupon the Adhvaryu, having taken ghee in four ladlings, steps\ndown into the water, and takes the two waves which flow away (in different\ndirections) after an animal or a man has stept (or plunged) into it.\n\n5:3:4:55\\. The one which rises in front of him he catches up with (Va _g_. S.\nX, 2), 'Thou art the male's wave, a bestower of kingship: bestow kingship on\nme, hail!--Thou art the male's wave, a bestower of kingship: bestow kingship\non N.N.!'\n\n5:3:4:66\\. He then catches up that (wave) which rises up behind him with,\n'Thou art the lord of a host of males, a bestower of kingship: bestow kingship\non me, hail!--Thou art the lord of a host of males, a bestower of kingship:\nbestow kingship on N.N.!' With that (water) he sprinkles; for indeed that is\nthe vigour of the water which rises when either beast or man plunges into it:\nit is with vigour he thus sprinkles him. This is one kind of water: it is that\nhe now brings.\n\n5:3:4:77\\. He then takes flowing (water) with (Va _g_. S. X, 3), 'Task-plying\nye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on me, hail!--Task-plying ye\nare, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!' With that (water) he\nsprinkles; for with vigour these (waters) flow, whence nothing stops them\nflowing along: it is\n\np. 75\n\nwith vigour he thus sprinkles him. This is one kind of water: it is that he\nnow brings.\n\n5:3:4:88\\. He then takes such (water) as flows against the stream of the\nflowing water with, 'Powerful ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye\nkingship on me, hail!--Powerful ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye\nkingship on N.N.!' With that (water) he sprinkles, for with vigour indeed\nthose (waters) flow against the stream of the flowing ones: it is with vigour\nhe thus sprinkles him. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.\n\n5:3:4:99\\. He then takes (water) that flows off (the main current) with,\n'Overflowing waters ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on me,\nhail!--Overflowing waters ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on\nN.N.!' With that (water) he sprinkles. Now that (flow of water), after\nseparating itself from that (main current), comes to be that again 1; and so\nthere is in his kingdom even one belonging to some other kingdom, and even\nthat man from another kingdom he absorbs: thus he (the Adhvaryu) bestows\nabundance upon him (the king), and it is with abundance that he thus\nconsecrates him. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.\n\n5:3:4:1010\\. He then takes the lord of rivers (sea-water) with, 'Thou art the\nlord of waters, a bestower of kingship: bestow thou kingship on me, hail!--\nThou art the lord of waters, a bestower of kingship: bestow thou kingship on\nN.N.!'\n\np. 76\n\n[paragraph continues] With that (water) he sprinkles him; and that lord of\nrivers (the ocean) being the same as the lord of waters, he thereby makes him\n(the king) the lord of the people. This is one kind of water: it is that he\nnow brings.\n\n5:3:4:1111\\. He then takes (water from) a whirlpool with, 'Thou art the\noffspring of the waters, a bestower of kingship: bestow thou kingship on me,\nhail!--Thou art the offspring of the waters, a bestower of kingship: bestow\nthou kingship on N.N.!' With that (water) he sprinkles. Now the waters enclose\nthe offspring (embryo): he thus makes him the offspring of the people. This is\none kind of water: it is that he now brings.\n\n5:3:4:1212\\. Then what standing pool of flowing water there is in a sunny\nspot, that (water) he takes with (Va _g_. S. X, 4), 'Sun-skinned ye are,\nbestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on me, hail!--Sun-skinned ye are,\nbestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!' With that (water) he\nsprinkles: it is with lustre he thereby sprinkles him, and makes him sun-\nskinned. Now it is to Varu _n_ a that those waters belong which, (whilst being\npart) of flowing water, do not flow: and Varu _n_ a's quickening (sava) is\nthat Ra _g_ asuya: therefore he sprinkles him therewith. This is one kind of\nwater: it is that he now brings.\n\n5:3:4:1313\\. He then catches such (water) as it rains while the sun shines,\nwith, 'Lustrous as the sun ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship\non me, hail!--Lustrous as the sun ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye\nkingship on N.N.!' With this (water) he sprinkles: it is with lustre he\nthereby sprinkles him, and lustrous\n\np. 77\n\nas the sun he thereby makes him. And pure indeed is such water as it rains\nwhile the sun shines, for before it has reached this (earth), he catches it:\nhe thus makes him pure thereby. This is one kind of water: it is that he now\nbrings.\n\n5:3:4:1414\\. He then takes (water) from a pond with, 'Pleasing ye are,\nbestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on me!--Pleasing ye are, bestowers\nof kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!' With that (water) he sprinkles: he\nthereby makes the people steady and faithful to him. This is one kind of\nwater: it is that he now brings.\n\n5:3:4:1515\\. He then draws (water) from a well with, 'Fold-dwellers ye are,\nbestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on me, hail!--Fold-dwellers ye are,\nbestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!' With this (water) he\nsprinkles. He thereby brings (some of) the water which is beyond this (earth),\nand also (he does so) for the completeness of the waters, this is why he\nsprinkles him therewith. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.\n\n5:3:4:1616\\. He then takes dew-drops 1 with, 'Devoted 2\n\np. 78\n\nye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on me, hail!--Devoted ye\nare, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!' With that (water) he\nsprinkles: it is with food he thereby consecrates him, and food he thereby\nbestows upon him, For even as this fire burns up (the wood) so does that sun\nyonder, even in rising, burn up the plants, the food. But those waters coming\ndown, quench that (heat), for if those waters were not to come down, there\nwould be no food left remaining here: it is with food he thus sprinkles him.\nThis is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.\n\n5:3:4:1717\\. He then takes honey with, 'Most powerful ye are, bestowers of\nkingship: bestow ye kingship on me, hail!--Most powerful ye are, bestowers of\nkingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!' With this (water) he sprinkles, and it\nis by the essence of the waters and plants that he thereby sprinkles him. This\nis one kind of water: it is that he now brings.\n\n5:3:4:1818\\. He then takes embryonic (waters) of a calving cow with, 'Mighty\nye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on me, hail!--Mighty ye are,\nbestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!' With that (water) he\nsprinkles: it is with cattle he thereby consecrates him. This is one kind of\nwater: it is that he now brings.\n\n5:3:4:1919\\. He then takes milk with, 'Man-supporting ye are, bestowers of\nkingship: bestow ye kingship on me, hail!--Man-supporting ye are, bestowers of\nkingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!' With that (water) he sprinkles:\n\np. 79\n\nit is with cattle he thereby consecrates him. This is one kind of water: it is\nthat he now brings.\n\n5:3:4:2020\\. He then takes clarified butter with, 'All-supporting ye are,\nbestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on me, hail!--All-supporting ye are,\nbestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!' With that (water) he\nsprinkles: it is with the essence of cattle he thereby consecrates him. This\nis one kind of water: it is that he now brings.\n\n5:3:4:2121\\. Having then caught up (moist) sun-motes with the hollow of his\nhands, he mixes them (with the other kinds of water), with, 'Self-ruling\nwaters ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!' For those\nsun-motes are indeed self-ruling waters, since they are flowing, as it were,\nand, not yielding to one another's superiority, keep being now higher now\nlower: he thus thereby bestows self-ruling power upon him. This is one kind of\nwater: it is that he now brings.\n\n5:3:4:2222\\. These then are seventeen (kinds of) water he brings together, for\nPra _g_ apati is seventeenfold, and Pra _g_ apati is the sacrifice: that is\nwhy he brings together seventeen kinds of water.\n\n5:3:4:2323\\. Now sixteen kinds of water are those he offers upon; and he\noffers sixteen oblations: that makes thirty-two. On two of them he does not\noffer, viz. on the water from the Sarasvati and on the sun-motes: that makes\nthirty-four. For three and thirty are the gods, and Pra _g_ apati is the\nthirty-fourth: he thus makes him to be Pra _g_ apati (the lord of creatures).\n\n5:3:4:2424\\. And as to why he takes (water) each time after offering,--the\nghee, to be sure, is a thunderbolt:\n\np. 80\n\nhaving won them, one by one, by means of that thunderbolt, the ghee, and made\nthem his own, he takes them.\n\n5:3:4:2525\\. And as to why he does not offer on the (water) from the\nSarasvati,--Sarasvati, to be sure, is (the goddess of) Speech, and the ghee is\na thunderbolt: 'Lest I should injure (the goddess of) Speech! thus (he thinks,\nand) therefore he does not offer on the water from the Sarasvati.\n\n5:3:4:2626\\. And as to why he does not offer on the sun-motes: 'Lest I should\noffer that oblation in a doubtful way 1!' thus (he thinks, and) therefore he\ndoes not offer on the sun-motes.\n\n5:3:4:2727\\. He pours them together into an udumbara vessel with, 'Let the\nhoney-sweet mix with the honey-sweet!'--'Let those full of essence mix with\nthose full of essence!' he thereby says;--'Winning great power (kshatra) for\nthe Kshatriya!' in saying this he prays in a covert way for power to the\nSacrificer.\n\n5:3:4:2828\\. He deposits them in front of the Maitravaru _n_ a's hearth, with,\n'Unimpaired rest ye, the strengthful!'--'unimpaired by the Rakshas rest ye!'\nhe thereby says; and by 'strengthful' he means to say 'powerful; 'bestowing\ngreat power on the Kshatriya;'--in saying this he prays in an overt way for\npower to the Sacrificer.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[73:1](sbe4116.htm#fr_156) This water gathered from an adjacent river and\npond, with some admixture of genuine water from the sacred river Sarasvati-\nwhence the whole water is also called 'sarasvatya apa _h_ '--is to be used\npartly in the place of the ordinary Vasativari water, and partly for the\nconsecration or anointment (sprinkling) of the king. The different kinds of\nwater or liquids are first taken in separate vessels of pala _s_ a (butea\nfrondosa) wood, and then poured together into the udumbara vessel.\n\n[75:1](sbe4116.htm#fr_157) That is to say, it ultimately flows back and\nmingles again with the main current.\n\n[77:1](sbe4116.htm#fr_158) Saya _n_ a explains 'prushva' by 'nihara _h_ '\n(mist water), the commentators on Katy. XV, 4, 38, by 'hoar-frost.'\n\n[77:2](sbe4116.htm#fr_159) It is difficult to see in what sense the author\ntakes va _s_ a. While Mahidhara (Va _g_. S. X, 4) explains it by 'pleasing' or\n'desirable' (u _s_ yante _g_ anai _h_ kamyante\xe0\xa4\xbdnnanishpattihetutrat); Saya _n_\na leaves a choice between that meaning (sarvai _h_ kamyamana) and that of\n'obedient, submissive' (yadva va _s_ ya stha, niharo hi nadipravahavan\nmanushyadigatim na pratibadhnati, ato va _s_ yatvam prushva _n_ am\nannadyatmakatvam upapadayati; MS. I. O. 657). The St. Petersburg dictionary\ngives the meaning 'submissive,' but leaves it doubtful whether it may not be\nderived from va _s_ a, 'fat, grease.'\n\n[80:1](sbe4116.htm#fr_160) On account of the doubtful nature of the watery\nsun-motes.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 3, 5.
