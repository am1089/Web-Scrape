What people call sacrifice (ya _g_ \xc3\xb1a), that is really abstinence (brahma\n_k_ arya). For he who knows, obtains that (world of Brahman, which others\nobtain by sacrifice), by means of abstinence.\n\nWhat people call sacrifice (ish _t_ a), that is really abstinence, for by\nabstinence, having searched (ish _t_ va), he obtains the Self.\n\n2\\. What people call sacrifice (sattraya _n_ a), that is really abstinence,\nfor by abstinence he obtains from the Sat (the true), the safety (tra _n_ a)\nof the Self.\n\nWhat people call the vow of silence (mauna), that is really abstinence, for he\nwho by abstinence has found out the Self, meditates (manute).\n\n3\\. What people call fasting (ana _s_ akayana), that is really abstinence, for\nthat Self does not perish (na na _s_ yati), which we find out by abstinence.\n\nWhat people call a hermit's life (ara _n_ yayana), that is really abstinence.\nAra 1 and _N_ ya are two lakes in the world of Brahman, in the third heaven\nfrom hence; and there is the lake Airanimadiya, and the A _s_ vattha tree,\nshowering down Soma, and the city of Brahman (Hira _n_ yagarbha) Apara _g_ ita\n2, and the golden Prabhuvimita (the hall built by Prabhu, Brahman).\n\nNow that world of Brahman belongs to those who find the lakes Ara and _N_ ya\nin the world of Brahman by means of abstinence; for them there is freedom in\nall the worlds 3.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[131:1](sbe01165.htm#fr_337) In the Kaush. Br. Up. I, 3, the lake is called\nAra, at least according to the commentator.\n\n[131:2](sbe01165.htm#fr_338) In the Kaush. Br. Up. Apara _g_ ita is not pu _h_\n, but ayatanam.\n\n[131:3](sbe01165.htm#fr_339) The fifth kha _n_ _d_ a is chiefly meant to\nrecommend brahma _k_ arya p. 132 or abstinence from all worldly enjoyments,\nenjoined on the brahma _k_ arin, the student, as a means of obtaining a\nknowledge of Brahman. But instead of showing that such abstinence is\nindispensable for a proper concentration of our intellectual faculties, we are\ntold that abstinence is the same as certain sacrifices; and this is shown, not\nby arguments, but by a number of very far-fetched plays on words. These it is\nimpossible to render in any translation, nay, they hardly deserve being\ntranslated. Thus abstinence is said to be identical with sacrifice, ya _g_ \xc3\xb1a,\nbecause yo _g_ \xc3\xb1ata, 'he who knows,' has a certain similarity with ya _g_ \xc3\xb1a.\nIsh _t_ a, another kind of sacrifice, is compared with esha _n_ a, search;\nsattraya _n_ a with Sat, the True, the Brahman, and traya _n_ a, protection;\nmauna, silence, with manana, meditating (which may be right); ana _s_ akayana,\nfasting, with na _s_ , to perish, and ara _n_ yagana, a hermit's life, with\nara, _n_ ya, and ayana, going to the two lakes Ara and _N_ ya, which are\nbelieved to exist in the legendary world of Brahman. Nothing can be more\nabsurd. Having once struck the note of Brahmanic legends, such as we find it,\nfor instance, in the Kaushitaki-brahma _n_ a-upanishad, the author goes on.\nBesides the lakes Ara and _N_ ya (in the Kaushitaki-brahma _n_ a-upanishad we\nhave only one lake, called \xc3\x82ra), he mentions the Airammadiya lake, and\nexplains it as aira (ira annam, tanmaya airo ma _n_ _d_ as, tena pur _n_ am\nairam) and madiya, delightful. The Asvattha tree, which pours down Soma, is\nnot tortured into anything else, except that Soma is explained as the\nimmortal, or nectar. Apara _g_ ita becomes the city of Brahman, because it can\nbe conquered by no one except those who have practised abstinence. And the\nhall which elsewhere is called Vibhu-pramita becomes Prabhu-vimitam, or\nPrabhu-vinirmita, made by Prabhu, i.e. Brahman. All the fulfilled desires, as\nenumerated in kha _n_ _d_ as 2-5, whether the finding again of our fathers and\nmothers, or entering the Brahmaloka with its lakes and palaces, must be taken,\nnot as material (sthula), but as mental only (manasa). On that account,\nhowever, they are by no means considered as false or unreal, as little as\ndreams are. Dreams are false and unreal, relatively only, i. e. relatively to\nwhat we see, when we awake; but not in themselves. Whatever we see in waking,\nalso, has been shown to be p. 133 false; because it consists of forms and\nnames only; yet these forms and names have a true element in them, viz. the\nSat. Before we know that Sat, all the objects we see in waking seem true; as\ndreams seem true in dreaming. But when once we awake from our waking by true\nknowledge, we see that nothing is true but the Sat. When we imagine we see a\nserpent, and then discover that it is a rope, the serpent disappears as false,\nbut what was true in it, the rope, remains true.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 6](sbe01166.htm)\n\n"
