And on account of an indicatory mark.\n\nAn indicatory mark also gives to understand that repetition is required. For,\nin the section treating of meditation\n\np. 333\n\non the udgitha, the text rejects the meditation on the udgitha viewed as the\nsun, because its result is one sun only, and (in the clause 'Do thou resolve\nhis rays,' &c.) enjoins a meditation on his manifold rays as leading to the\npossession of many suns ( _Kh_. Up. I, 5, 1; 2); which shows that the\nrepetition of meditations is something well known. Now as other meditations\nare meditations no less than the one referred to, it follows that repetition\nholds good for all of them.\n\nHere the following objection may be raised. With regard to those meditations\nwhose fruit is something to be effected repetition may hold good, because\nthereby superior strength may be imparted to them. But of what use can\nrepetition be with regard to the meditations having for their object the\nhighest Brahman, which present to us Brahman as the universal Self\ncharacterised by eternal purity, thought, and freedom? Should it be said that\nrepetition has to be allowed because the knowledge of Brahman being the Self\ncannot spring up on hearing a text once only, we reply that in that case it\nwill not spring up even when it is heard repeatedly. For if a text such as\n'Thou art that' does not originate the true notion of Brahman if heard once,\nwhat hope is there that the desired effect should be produced by its\nrepetition?--Perhaps it will be said that a sentence alone is not able to lead\nto the intuition of a thing; but that a sentence assisted by reasoning may\nenable us to intuite Brahman as the universal Self. But even in that case\nrepetition would be useless; for the reasoning will lead to the desired\nintuition even if gone through once only.--Again it will perhaps be said that\nthe sentence and reasoning together effect only a cognition of the generic\nnature of the object known, not of its specific individual character. When, to\nexemplify this, a man says that he feels a pain in his heart another person\ncan infer from this statement--and certain accompanying symptoms such as\ntrembling of the limbs--only that there exists a pain in general but is unable\nto intuite its specific character; all he knows is 'This man suffers a pain.'\nBut what removes ignorance is (not\n\np. 334\n\na general knowledge but) the intuitive knowledge of the specific character of\nsomething. And repetition serves to produce such knowledge.--This also is not\nso. For if so much only is done repeatedly even, no specific knowledge can\nspring up. When a specific character is not cognized through scripture and\nreasoning being applied once, it will not be cognized through them if applied\na hundred times even. Hence whether scripture and reasoning produce specific\nknowledge or general knowledge, in either case they will do so even if acting\nonce only; and repetition therefore is of no use. Nor can it be laid down as a\nbinding rule that scripture and reasoning, applied once, in no case produce\nintuitive knowledge; for their effect will after all depend on the various\ndegrees of intelligence of those who wish to learn. Moreover a certain use of\nrepetition may be admitted in the case of worldly things which consist of\nseveral parts and possess generic character as well as individual difference;\nfor there the student may grasp by one act of attention one part of the\nobject, and by another act another part; so e.g. in the case of long chapters\nto be studied. But in order to reach a true knowledge of Brahman whose Self is\nmere intelligence and which therefore is destitute of generic character as\nwell as specific difference there clearly is no need of repetition.\n\nTo this we make the following reply. Repetition would indeed be useless for\nhim who is able to cognize the true nature of Brahman even if enounced once\nonly in the sentence 'Thou art that.' But he who is not able to do that, for\nhim repetition is of use. For this reason the teacher in the _Kh_ andogya,\nhaving given instruction in the sentence 'Thou art that, O _S_ vetaketu,' and\nbeing again and again asked by his pupil--'Please, sir, inform me still more'\n--removes his pupil's reasons for doubt, and again and again repeats the\ninstruction 'Thou art that.' We have already given an analogous explanation of\nthe passage 'The Self is to be heard, to be thought, to be reflected upon.'--\nBut has not the purvapakshin declared that if the first enunciation of the\nsentence 'Thou art that' is not able to effect an intuition of its sense,\nrepetition will likewise\n\np. 335\n\nfail of the desired effect?--This objection, we reply, is without force,\nbecause the alleged impossibility is not confirmed by observation. For we\nobserve that men by again and again repeating a sentence which they, on the\nfirst hearing, had understood imperfectly only, gradually rid themselves of\nall misconceptions and arrive at a full understanding of the true sense.--\nMoreover the sentence 'Thou art that' teaches that what is denoted by the term\n'thou' is identical with what is denoted by 'that.' Now the latter term\ndenotes the subject of the entire section, viz. the thinking Brahman which is\nthe cause of the origin and so on of the world; which is known from other\npassages such as 'Brahman which is true knowledge, infinite' (Taitt. Up. II,\n1); 'Brahman that is knowledge and bliss' (B _ri_. Up. III, 9, 28); 'That\nBrahman is unseen, but seeing; unknown, but knowing' (B _ri_. Up. III, 8, 11);\n'not produced' (Mu. Up. II, 1, 2); 'not subject to old age, not subject to\ndeath' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 25); 'not coarse, not fine; not short, not long' (B\n_ri_. Up. III, 8, 8). In these passages terms such as 'not produced' deny the\ndifferent phases of existence such as origination; such terms as 'not coarse'\ndeny of it the qualities of substances such as coarseness; and such terms as\n'knowledge' declare that the luminousness of intelligence constitutes its\nnature. The entity thus described--which is free from all the qualities of\ntransmigratory existence, has consciousness for its Self and is called Brahman\n--is known, by all students of the Vedanta, as what is denoted by the term\n'that.' They likewise know that what is denoted by the term 'thou' is the\ninward Self (pratyagatman); which is the agent in seeing and hearing, is\n(successively) apprehended as the inward Self of all the outward involucra\nbeginning with the gross body (cp. Taitt. Up.), and finally ascertained as of\nthe nature of intelligence. Now in the case of those persons for whom the\nmeaning of these two terms is obstructed by ignorance, doubt, and\nmisconception, the sentence 'Thou art that' cannot produce a right knowledge\nof its sense, since the knowledge of the sense of a sentence presupposes the\nknowledge of the sense of the words; for them therefore the repetition of the\nscripture\n\np. 336\n\ntext and of reasoning must be assumed to have a purpose, viz. the discernment\nof the true sense of the words.--And although the object to be known, viz. the\nSelf, does not consist of parts, yet men wrongly superimpose upon it the\nattribute of being made up of many parts, such as the body, the senses, the\nmanas, the buddhi, the objects of the senses, the sensations, and so on. Now\nby one act of attention we may discard one of these parts, and by another act\nof attention another part; so that a successively progressing cognition may\nvery well take place. This however is merely an antecedent of the (true)\nknowledge of the Self (in which there can be no successive stages).\n\nThose quick-witted persons, on the other hand, in whose mind the sense of the\nwords is not obstructed by ignorance, doubt, and misconception, are able to\nintuite the sense of the sentence 'Thou art that' on its first enunciation\neven, and for them therefore repetition is not required. For the knowledge of\nthe Self having once sprung up discards all ignorance; so that in this case no\nprogressive process of cognition can be acknowledged.--All this might be so--\nan objection is raised--if cognition did spring up in any mind in the way\ndescribed. (But this is not the case); for the cognition of the Self being\nsubject to pain and so on has such strength that nobody ever reaches the\ncognition of all absence of pain and so on.--This objection, we reply, is\nwithout force; for it can be shown that the conceit of the Self being subject\nto pain, &c., is a wrong conceit, no less than the conceit of the body being\nthe Self. For we clearly observe that when the body is cut or burned a wrong\nnotion springs up, 'I am being cut,' 'I am being burned;' and similarly we\nobserve that when sons, friends, &c. who are even more external to the Self\nthan one's own body--suffer affliction, that affliction is wrongly attributed\nto the Self. Analogous to these cases is the conceit of the Self being subject\nto pain, &c.; for like the body and so on, the condition of being subject to\npain is observed as something external to intelligence. This moreover follows\nfrom its not being continued in such states as dreamless sleep and the like;\nwhile scripture expressly declares that in deep\n\np. 337\n\nsleep intelligence suffers no interruption, 'And when there he does not see,\nyet he is seeing,' &c. (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 22). Hence the intuition of the\nSelf consists in the knowledge, 'My Self is pure intelligence free from all\npain.' For him who possesses that knowledge there remains no other work. Thus\nscripture says, 'What shall we do with offspring, we who have this Self and\nthis world' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 22). And Sm _ri_ ti also says, 'But that man\nwho loves the Self, is satisfied by the Self and has all his longings stilled\nby the Self only, for him there is no further work' (Bha. Gita III, 12).--For\nhim, on the other hand, who does not reach that intuition all at once, we\nadmit repetition, in order that the desired intuition may be brought about. He\nalso, however, must not be moved towards repetition in such a way as to make\nhim lose the true sense of the teaching, 'Thou art that.' In the mind of one\non whom repetition is enjoined as a duty, there arise infallibly notions\nopposed to the true notion of Brahman, such as 'I have a claim on this\n(knowledge of the Self) as an agent; this is to be done by me 1.' But if a\nlearner, naturally slow-minded, is about altogether to dismiss from his mind\nthe purport of the sentence, because it does not reveal itself to him, it is\npermissible to fortify him in the understanding of that sense by means of\nreasoning on the texts relative to repetition and so on.--All this establishes\nthe conclusion that, also in the case of cognitions of the highest Brahman,\nthe instruction leading to such cognition may be repeated.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[337:1](sbe38263.htm#fr_207) Care must be taken not to engender in the mind of\nsuch a learner the notion that the repeated acts of reflection are incumbent\non him as a duty; for such notions would only obstruct the end aimed at, i.e.\nthe intuition that the Self of the meditating man is identical with Brahman's\nSelf, to which no notions of duty or action apply.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 1, 3](sbe38264.htm)\n\n"
