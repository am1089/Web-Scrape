If it be said that the other one (i.e. the individual soul) (is meant) on\naccount of a reference to it (made in a complementary passage), (we say) no,\non account of the impossibility.\n\nIf the small (ether) is to be explained as the highest Lord on account of a\ncomplementary passage, then, the purvapakshin resumes, we point out that\nanother complementary passage contains a reference to the other one, i. e. to\nthe individual soul: 'Now that serene being (literally: serenity, complete\nsatisfaction), which after having risen out from this earthly body and having\nreached the highest light, appears in its true form, that is, the Self; thus\nhe spoke' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 3, 4). For there the word 'serenity,' which is\nknown to denote, in another scriptural passage, the state of deep sleep, can\nconvey the idea of the individual soul only when it is in\n\np. 183\n\nthat state, not of anything else. The 'rising from the body' also can be\npredicated of the individual soul only whose abode the body is; just as air,\n&c., whose abode is the ether, are said to arise from the ether. And just as\nthe word 'ether,' although in ordinary language not denoting the highest Lord,\nyet is admitted to denote him in such passages as, 'The ether is the revealer\nof forms and names,' because it there occurs in conjunction with qualities of\nthe highest Lord, so it may likewise denote the individual soul Hence the term\n'the small ether' denotes in the passage under discussion the individual soul,\n'on account of the reference to the other.'\n\nNot so, we reply, 'on account of the impossibility.' In the first place, the\nindividual soul, which imagines itself to be limited by the internal organ and\nits other adjuncts, cannot be compared with the ether. And, in the second\nplace, attributes such as freedom from evil, and the like, cannot be ascribed\nto a being which erroneously transfers to itself the attributes of its\nlimiting adjuncts. This has already been set forth in the first Sutra of the\npresent adhikara _n_ a, and is again mentioned here in order to remove all\ndoubt as to the soul being different from the highest Self. That the reference\npointed out by the purvapakshin is not to the individual soul will, moreover,\nbe shown in one of the next Sutras (I, 3, 21).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 19](sbe34088.htm)\n\n"
