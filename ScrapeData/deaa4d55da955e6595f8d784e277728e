Should it be said (that this is not so) on account of specialisation of\nabode; we say no, on account of the acknowledgment (of a place of the Self),\nviz. in the heart.\n\nThere is a difference. The drop of ointment can produce its effect as at any\nrate it is in contact with a definite part of the body. But we know of no such\npart in the case of the soul!--Not so, we reply. Scripture informs us that the\nSelf abides in a definite part of the body, viz. the heart. 'For that Self is\nin the heart, there are a hundred and one veins.' And in reply to the question\n'What is that Self?' the text has 'He who is within the heart, surrounded by\nthe Pra _n_ as, the Person of light, consisting of knowledge' (B _ri._ Up. IV,\n3, 7).--The parallel case of the sandal-ointment is referred to in order to\npoint out that the Self abides in some particular part of the body; while the\nointment is not bound to any special place.--In the next Sutra the Sutrakara\nproceeds to state how, according to his own view, the Self, although abiding\nin one spot only, gives rise to effects extending over the whole body.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 26.
