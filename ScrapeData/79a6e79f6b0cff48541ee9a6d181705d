When there is a body, as in the waking state.\n\nWhen, on the other hand,the released soul possesses a body created by its own\nwill, then it enjoys its various delights in the same way as a waking man\ndoes.--In the same way as the highest Person creates out of himself, for his\nown delight, the world of the Fathers and so on; so he sometimes creates such\nworlds for the enjoyment of the released souls. But sometimes, again, the\nsouls using their own creative will-power themselves create their own worlds,\nwhich however are included within the sphere of sport of the highest Person\n(so that the souls in enjoying them do not pass beyond the intuition of\nBrahman).\n\nBut it has been taught that the soul is of atomic size; how then can it\nconnect itself with many bodies?--To this question the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 15.
