Wilkins, [1900], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 437\n\n### CHAPTER VI.\n\n#### THE ASURAS.\n\nIn the Pur\xc4\x81nas and other of the later writings of the Hindus, and also in the\npopular mind, the asuras are powerful evil beings; in translations the word is\nrepresented by such terms as demons, giants, etc. As the suras * were the\ngods, the asuras were not-gods, and therefore the enemies or opponents of the\ngods. In the Vedas the name asura is applied more frequently to the gods\nthemselves than to their enemies, whilst it is also used very much in the same\nmanner as in the later writings. In the Rig-Veda, Varuna is accosted as\nfollows: "King Varuna has made a highway for the sun to go over. O thou wise\nasura and king, loosen our sins!" Again: "The all-knowing asura established\nthe heavens, and fixed the limits of the earth. He sat as the supreme ruler of\nall worlds. These are the works of Varuna." "Asura stands for the Supreme\nSpirit," in another verse, and "also as an appellative for Praj\xc4\x81pati or\ncreation\'s lord." \xe2\x80\xa0 Again and again Varuna alone, and also in conjunction with\nMitra, is called\n\np. 438\n\nan asura. "All the Vedic gods have shared the same title, not excepting even\ngoddesses." "Varuna was the all-knowing asura, Praj\xc4\x81pati the Supreme Being;\nIndra, the Maruts, Tvastri, Mitra, Rudra, Agni, V\xc4\x81yu, Pushan, Savitri,\nParjanya, the sacrificial priests, were all asuras. In fine, Deva (god) and\nasura were synonymous expressions in a multitude of texts." *\n\nOn the other hand, in the Rig-Veda, Indra is the destroyer of asuras. "The\nsame Veda which speaks of the asuras as celestial beings supplies its readers\nalso with the Mantras, by means of which devas overcame asuras. The texts\nwhich are condemnatory of the suras as impure and ungodly are far less in\nnumber than those which recognize the term as applicable to gods and priests."\nDr. Banerjea, in the most interesting and ingenious article from which the\nabove extracts are made, suggests a means of reconciling these contradictory\nuses of the word "asura." Before the Indo-Aryans arrived in India, they had\nlived in close proximity to the Persians, the original worshippers of fire.\n"What could be more natural," he asks, "than that the Asura-Pracheta, or\nAsura-Viswaveda of the one branch, was but the translation of the Ahura-Mazda\n(the Wise Lord, according to the \'Zend-Avesta\') of the other branch; and that\nthe word \'Ahura,\' which the one used in a divine sense, would become a\nhousehold word in the other branch, in the same sense?" the word "Ahura" being\nchanged into "Asura," in a way common to many other words. He then goes on to\nsay, that as "Assur" was the term used in Assyria for the Supreme Lord, and\nthe Assyrians were for some time the rulers of the Persians, it was natural\nthat this word should find its way into Persia; the only change being this,\nthat the Persians added\n\np. 439\n\nMazda (wise or good) to the term "Assur," and the Indo-Aryans received it from\nthem. So much for the good use of the term "Asura."\n\nBut the word "Assur" was not only used for the Supreme Lord, it also\nrepresented the Assyrian nation, his worshippers, who were most cruel in their\ntreatment of their foes; and as, later on, the bitterest hatred is known to\nhave existed between the Indo-Aryans and the Persians, the followers of Ahura-\nMazda, Dr. Banerjea concludes that owing to the cruelties perpetrated by the\nAssyrians on the one hand, and the hatred cherished towards them by the\nPersians on the other, the branch of the Aryan family that migrated into India\nbrought with them very bitter feelings towards Assur (the Assyrian people) and\nAhuri (the belongings of Ahura); and thus the term "Asura," which at one time\nwas considered a becoming epithet for the Supreme Being, became descriptive\nonly of those who were the enemies of the gods. In order to afford sanction\nfor this altered sense of a word, a new derivation has been given to it. The\nword was originally derived from the root _as_ , through _asu_ , "breath," and\nmeans a spirit, or "the Great Spirit." Now, however, it is explained to be\nsimply a compound of _a_ privative, and _sura_ , "god," meaning a non-god:\ntherefore a demon.\n\nWhatever be the cause of it, there is no doubt that at the present day, and\nthroughout the later writings of the Hindus, the term "asura" is used only for\nthe enemies of the gods. In the "Taittirya Sanhita" * we read "that the gods\nand asuras contended together, and that the former, being less numerous than\nthe latter, took some bricks, and placing them in a proper position to receive\nthe sacrificial fire, with the formula, Thou\n\np. 440\n\nart a multiplier,\' they became numerous." In the "Satapatha Br\xc4\x81hmana" * it is\nsaid that "the gods and asuras, both descendants of Praj\xc4\x81pati, \xe2\x80\xa0 obtained\ntheir father\'s inheritance, truth and falsehood. The gods, abandoning\nfalsehood, adopted truth; the asuras, abandoning truth, adopted falsehood.\nSpeaking truth exclusively, the gods became weaker, but in the end became\nprosperous; the asuras, speaking falsehood exclusively, became rich, but in\nthe end succumbed." The gods tried to sacrifice, but though interrupted at\nfirst by the asuras, at length succeeded, and so became superior to their\nfoes. Another legend in the same book teaches that the asuras, when offering\nsacrifices, placed the oblations in their own mouths, whilst the gods gave\ntheir oblations to each other; at length Praj\xc4\x81pati giving himself to them, the\nsacrifices, which supply the gods with food, were henceforth enjoyed by them.\n\nAlthough there were frequent wars between the gods and asuras, the suras were\nnot averse to receive the aid of their foes at the churning of the ocean; and\nsome of them were not inferior in power and skill to the gods. B\xc4\x81li, one of\ntheir number, is worshipped by the Hindus on their birthday; and Jalandhara\nconquered in battle even Vishnu himself; Indra and the other gods fled before\nhim, and Siva, unaided, could not destroy him. R\xc4\x81hu is an asura, and it was to\ndestroy some of these mighty beings who distressed the gods, that Durg\xc4\x81 and\nK\xc4\x81li had to put forth their strength. In the constant wars between these\nrivals, Sukra, the preceptor of the asuras, was frequently called to\nresuscitate the fallen. The following story of Jalandhara from the Uttara\n\np. 441\n\n[paragraph continues] Kh\xc4\x81nda of the "Padma Pur\xc4\x81na" * will illustrate the\nteaching of the later Hindu Scriptures respecting the asuras.\n\n##### JALANDHARA.\n\nThe story of Jalandhara\'s birth and life was narrated by N\xc4\x81rada to the\nP\xc4\x81ndavas to encourage them when they were in distress on account of their\nmisfortunes. He reminds them that adversity and prosperity come to all: R\xc4\x81hu,\nwho swallows the sun, is the same R\xc4\x81hu whose head was severed from his body by\nVishnu; and the valiant Jalandhara, the son of the Ocean and the river Ganges,\nwho on one occasion conquered Vishnu, was himself slain by Siva. The mention\nof this fact excites the curiosity of his hearers; and in answer to their\ninquiry about him, N\xc4\x81rada gives the following history.\n\nIndra and the other gods, arriving at Siva\'s home on Mount Kail\xc4\x81sa to pay him\na visit, informed the bull Nandi, the chief of Siva\'s attendants, that they\nhad come to amuse his master with song and dance. Siva invites them to enter,\nand, being delighted with their music, tells Indra to ask a boon, who, in a\ndefiant tone, asks that he might be a warrior like Siva himself. The boon is\ngranted, and the gods depart. No sooner have they left than Siva asks his\nattendants if they had not noticed Indra\'s haughty tone, when immediately\nthere stood before him a form of anger, black as darkness, who said to Siva,\n"Give me thy similitude, and then what can I do for you?" Siva tells him to\nincorporate himself with the river of heaven (Gang\xc4\x81), form a union between her\nand the Ocean, and conquer Indra.\n\np. 442\n\nIn obedience to Siva\'s command, Gang\xc4\x81 left the skies, and becoming united to\nthe Ocean, from them a son proceeded, at whose birth the earth trembled and\nwept, and the three worlds resounded with noise. Brahm\xc4\x81 coming to inquire the\ncause of this commotion, and asking to see the child, Gang\xc4\x81 lays it in his\nlap, when it seized his head, and would not loose it until its father opened\nits hand. Brahm\xc4\x81, admiring the child\'s strength, said, "From his holding so\nfirmly, let him be named Jalandhara," and bestowed upon him this boon, that he\n" should be unconquered by the gods, and enjoy the three worlds."\n\nJalandhara\'s boyhood was full of wonders. Borne up by the wind, he flew over\nthe ocean; his pets were lions which he had caught; and the largest birds and\nfishes were subject to him. When he grew up to manhood, at Sukra\'s request,\nhis father withdrew the sea from Jambadwipa, the residence of holy men, which\nbecame his home, and bearing his name has become celebrated. * M\xc4\x81ya, the\narchitect of the asuras, there built him a beautiful city, his father\ninstalled him as king, and Sukra gave him the charm by which he could raise\nthe dead to life. He married Vrind\xc4\x81, the daughter of an Apsaras named Swarn\xc4\x81,\nand soon after his wedding made war upon the gods.\n\nIn order to lead to a conflict, he sent a messenger to Indra, whom he found\n"surrounded by three hundred and thirty-three millions of deities," to demand\nthe restoration of the moon, the amrita, elephant, horse, gem, tree, and other\nthings of which he said Indra had robbed him, at the churning of his uncle,\nthe Sea of Milk; and also to resign Swarga. As Indra refuses to accede to this\nrequest, Jalandhara raises an army of warriors\n\np. 443\n\nhaving the heads of horses, elephants, camels, cats, tigers and lions, with\nwhich Indra\'s abode is soon surrounded. The gods in their extremity resort to\nVishnu for aid.\n\nOn Vishnu\'s arrival the battle commences. Multitudes are slain on both sides,\nbut the gods, when wounded, resort to the mountains, where they find herbs\nwhich quickly restore them. At length the greater gods and the leaders of the\ndaityas personally engage in conflict; Indra falls insensible, Rudra is taken\nprisoner, and Kuvera is laid low by a blow of a mace. After this, the tide\nturns in favour of the gods. When Indra struck B\xc4\x81li, the most costly gems\ndropped from his mouth; he therefore asked for his body, and with his\nthunderbolt cut it into many parts. "From the purity of his actions, the parts\nof his body became the germs of the various gems. From his bones came\ndiamonds, from his eyes sapphires, from his blood rubies, from his marrow\nemeralds, from his flesh crystals, from his tongue coral, and from his teeth\npearls."\n\nIndra being in his turn attacked by Jalandhara, Vishnu comes to the rescue;\nand though the asuras attack him in immense numbers, and the sky is dark with\ntheir arrows, Vishnu overthrows them as if they were leaves. One of their\nnumber, named Shailaroma, losing his head, seized hold of Garuda, Vishnu\'s\nmarvellous bird, when the severed head immediately rejoined his body; Garuda,\nseeing this wonderful event, flew oft with his master. Jalandhara was prevent\nfrom following him, as he had to call in the aid of Sukra to restore his\nwarriors to life.\n\nHearing that the soldiers of the gods were also restored to life through using\nherbs obtained from an island called Drona, situated in the Sea of Milk, he\nasked his uncle to submerge it. Being deprived of this\n\np. 444\n\nmeans of restoration, they appealed to Vishnu, who, attacking Jalandhara, was\nlaid low by the daitya, and would have been slain but for Lakshmi\'s\nintercession with her cousin. In return for his life Vishnu promised to remain\nnear the Sea of Milk. Jalandhara, having now conquered the gods, enjoyed peace\nand happiness.\n\nThe gods, however, being expelled from heaven, and deprived of sacrifices and\nthe amrita, did not long remain contented with their lot. They went together\nto Brahm\xc4\x81, who conducted them to Siva, whom they found "seated on a throne and\nattended by myriads of devoted servants, naked, deformed, curly-haired, with\nmatted locks and covered with dust." On Brahm\xc4\x81\' stating the case for the gods,\nSiva declared that, if Vishnu had been unsuccessful in fighting the demon, it\nwas impossible that he alone could overcome him; he therefore advised that the\ngods should unite to form a weapon by which their common enemy might be\ndestroyed. Acting on this advice, the gods, glowing with anger, darted forth\nvolumes of flames, to which Siva added the consuming beams of his third eye.\nVishnu, too, when summoned, added his flame of anger, and asked Siva to\ndestroy the daitya, excusing himself from the task on the ground that\nJalandhara was a relative of Lakshmi. Visvakarma and the deities were alarmed\nas they saw the glowing mass; but Siva, placing his heel on it, whirled round\nwith it, and formed it into the discus called Sudarsana, which sent forth such\nfiery beams that the gods cried out, "Preserve us!" Brahm\xc4\x81\'s beard was\nscorched as he took it into his hand--"such is the result of offering a gift\nto a blockhead"--but Siva hid it under his arm.\n\nN\xc4\x81rada informed Jalandhara of the intended attack\n\np. 445\n\nof Siva, and, enlarging on P\xc4\x81rvati\'s beauty, excited him to attack her husband\nthat he might win her. With this object he sent R\xc4\x81hu as an ambassador, to\nsummon the god to submission. On his arrival at the court the envoy delivered\nhis master\'s message to Siva, in the form of Panch\xc4\x81nana, who did not deign to\nspeak; but the snake Vasuki, falling to the ground from his hair, began to eat\nGanesa\'s rat. Seeing this, Kartikeya\'s peacock made such an awful noise that\nthe snake disgorged the rat and returned to his proper place.\n\nLakshmi then entered the assembly with a vessel of amrita, with which she\nresuscitated Brahm\xc4\x81\'s fifth head that was in Siva\'s hand; the head rolling on\nthe ground uttered most boastful language, until myriads of hideous forms from\nSiva\'s locks quieted it. R\xc4\x81hu, seeing all this, asked Siva to forsake his wife\nand children, and live a mendicant\'s life. At a sign from Siva, Nandi, the\nbull, showed him the door; this was the answer vouchsafed to the illustrious\nmaster\'s demand.\n\nWar being determined on, Jalandhara marched first to Kail\xc4\x81sa; but finding that\nSiva had forsaken it and taken up a position on a mountain near Lake Manasa,\nhe surrounded the mountain with his troops. Nandi marched against them, and\nspread destruction "like the waters of the deluge;" reserves, however, being\nbrought up, the army of the gods suffers loss. P\xc4\x81rvati, hearing that her sons,\nGanesa and Kartikeya, are hardly pressed, urged her husband to go in person\nand put forth his energy, though not to expose himself unnecessarily. Before\nleaving home, Siva carefully warned P\xc4\x81rvati to be on her guard during his\nabsence, as it was possible the daitya in some disguise might visit her; after\nthis, accompanied by Virabhadra and Manibhadra, two forms\n\np. 446\n\nof his anger, he went to the field of battle. When the conflict between the\ndaityas and the attendants of Siva had continued for some time, Jalandhara\ndevised a plan by which he hoped to succeed more easily than by fighting.\nGiving his own form and the command of his troops to a chief, the daitya king\nassumed the form of Siva, changed Durwarana into Nandi, and, taking the heads\nof Ganesa and Kartikeya under his arms, hastened to Siva\'s abode. Seeing this,\nP\xc4\x81rvati was overwhelmed with grief; but having some doubt of his being the\nreal Siva, she hid herself and would not listen to his overtures of love. To\nmake certain of his identity, she caused one of her attendants to assume her\nform and visit the daitya, who, returning with the information that he was not\nthe true Siva, P\xc4\x81rvati hid herself in a lotus, and her companions were changed\ninto bees which hovered around her.\n\nIn the mean time Vishnu had been more successful with Vrind\xc4\x81, the wife of\nJalandhara. In the guise of a Br\xc4\x81hman, he made a hermitage near her palace,\nand caused her to dream that she saw her husband\'s head severed from his body,\nhis flesh eaten by wild animals, and his eyes plucked out by vultures.\nDistracted with her dream, in a high fever she rushed into the forest, where\nan ogress met her, ate her mules, and was about to attack her, when the\nBr\xc4\x81hman came to her rescue. On reaching the hermitage, Vishnu induced her to\nenter, changed himself into the form of her husband, and there they lived\ntogether for some time. At length Vrind\xc4\x81, seeing through the disguise, cursed\nVishnu, telling him that, as he had wronged Jalandhara, he would himself be\nwronged, and, having purified herself from her sin, died. Her body was burned,\nher mother collected the ashes, and threw them into the Ganges. The forest in\n\np. 447\n\nwhich she was burned has ever since borne the name of Vrind\xc4\x81vana, * near Mount\nGovardhana.\n\nJalandhara, hearing of his wife\'s deception and death, was mad with rage; and,\nleaving the neighbourhood of P\xc4\x81rvati\'s home, returned to the field of battle.\nBy Sukra\'s power his dead heroes were restored to life, and a grand final\ncharge was made. At length Siva and Jalandhara personally fight; after a\ndesperate encounter, in which the daitya employs various magical powers, Siva\ncuts off his head; but it is no sooner severed than it resumes its place. Siva\nin his extremity summonses to his aid the female forms or energies of the\ngods, Br\xc4\x81hmi, Vaishnavi and the rest, who drink up the blood of the giant, and\nwith their aid Siva succeeds in destroying him, and the gods regain their\nkingdom and possessions.\n\n![](img/44700.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[437:*](hmvp43.htm#fr_401) Originally the suras were a class of inferior\ndeities, connected with Surya; afterwards the term was employed to signify the\ngods generally.\n\n[437:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp43.htm#fr_402) Dr. Banerjea, _Bengal Magazine_ , April, 1880.\n\n[438:*](hmvp43.htm#fr_403) Dr. Banerjea, _Bengal Magazine_ , April, 1880.\n\n[439:*](hmvp43.htm#fr_404) Muir, O.
