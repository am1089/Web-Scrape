(Brahman is that) from which the origin, &c., of this (world proceed).\n\nThe expression 'the origin', &c., means 'creation, subsistence, and\nreabsorption'. The 'this' (in 'of this') denotes this entire world with its\nmanifold wonderful arrangements, not to be fathomed by thought, and comprising\nwithin itself the aggregate of living souls from Brahma down to blades of\ngrass, all of which experience the fruits (of their former actions) in\ndefinite places and at definite times. 'That from which,' i.e. that highest\nPerson who is the ruler of all; whose nature is antagonistic to all evil;\nwhose purposes come true; who possesses infinite auspicious qualities, such as\nknowledge, blessedness, and so on; who is omniscient, omnipotent, supremely\nmerciful; from whom the creation, subsistence, and reabsorption of this world\nproceed--he is Brahman: such is the meaning of the Sutra.--The definition here\ngiven of Brahman is founded on the text Taitt. Up. III, 1, 'Bh _ri_ gu Varu\n_n_ i went to his father Varu _n_ a, saying, Sir, teach me Brahman', &c., up\nto 'That from which these beings are born, that by which when born they live,\nthat into which they enter at their death, try to know that: that is Brahman.'\n\nA doubt arises here. Is it possible, or not, to gain a knowledge of Brahman\nfrom the characteristic marks stated in this passage?--It is not possible, the\nPurvapakshin\n\np. 157\n\ncontends. The attributes stated in that passage--viz. being that from which\nthe world originates, and so on--do not properly indicate Brahman; for as the\nessence of an attribute lies in its separative or distinctive function, there\nwould result from the plurality of distinctive attributes plurality on the\npart of Brahman itself.--But when we say 'Devadatta is of a dark complexion,\nis young, has reddish eyes,' &c., we also make a statement as to several\nattributes, and yet we are understood to refer to one Devadatta only;\nsimilarly we understand in the case under discussion also that there is one\nBrahman only!--Not so, we reply. In Devadatta's case we connect all attributes\nwith one person, because we know his unity through other means of knowledge;\notherwise the distinctive power of several attributes would lead us, in this\ncase also, to the assumption of several substances to which the several\nattributes belong. In the case under discussion, on the other hand, we do not,\napart from the statement as to attributes, know anything about the unity of\nBrahman, and the distinctive power of the attributes thus necessarily urges\nupon us the idea of several Brahmans.--But we maintain that the unity of the\nterm 'Brahman' intimates the unity of the thing 'Brahman'!--By no means, we\nreply. If a man who knows nothing about cows, but wishes to know about them,\nis told 'a cow is that which has either entire horns, or mutilated horns, or\nno horns,' the mutally exclusive ideas of the possession of entire horns, and\nso on, raise in his mind the ideas of several individual cows, although the\nterm 'cow' is one only; and in the same way we are led to the idea of several\ndistinct Brahmans. For this reason, even the different attributes combined are\nincapable of defining the thing, the definition of which is desired.--Nor\nagain are the characteristics enumerated in the Taitt. passage (viz. creation\nof the world, &c.) capable of defining Brahman in the way of secondary marks\n(upalaksha _n_ a), because the thing to be defined by them is not previously\nknown in a different aspect. So-called secondary marks are the cause of\nsomething already known from a certain point of view, being\n\np. 158\n\nknown in a different aspect--as when it is said 'Where that crane is standing,\nthat is the irrigated field of Devadatta.'--But may we not say that from the\ntext 'The True, knowledge, the Infinite is Brahman,' we already have an idea\nof Brahman, and that hence its being the cause of the origin, &c., of the\nworld may be taken as collateral indications (pointing to something already\nknown in a certain way)?--Not so, we reply; either of these two defining texts\nhas a meaning only with reference to an aspect of Brahman already known from\nthe other one, and this mutual dependence deprives both of their force.--\nBrahman cannot therefore be known through the characteristic marks mentioned\nin the text under discussion.\n\nTo this prima facie view we make the following reply. Brahman can be known on\nthe basis of the origination, subsistence, and reabsorption of the world--\nthese characteristics occupying the position of collateral marks. No objection\ncan be raised against this view, on the ground that, apart from what these\ncollateral marks point to, no other aspect of Brahman is known; for as a\nmatter of fact they point to that which is known to us as possessing supreme\ngreatness (b _ri_ hattva) and power of growth (b _rim_ hana)--this being the\nmeaning of the root b _rim_ h (from which 'Brahman' is derived). Of this\nBrahman, thus already known (on the basis of etymology), the origination,\nsustentation, and reabsorption of the world are collateral marks. Moreover, in\nthe Taitt. text under discussion, the relative pronoun--which appears in three\nforms, (that) 'from whence,' (that) 'by which,' (that) 'into which'--refers to\nsomething which is already known as the cause of the origin, and so on, of the\nworld. This previous knowledge rests on the _Kh_. passage, 'Being only this\nwas in the beginning,' &c., up to 'it sent forth fire'--which declares that\nthe one principle denoted as 'being' is the universal material, and\ninstrumental cause. There the clause 'Being only this was in the beginning,\none only,' establishes that one being as the general material cause; the word\n'without a second' negatives the existence of a second operative cause; and\nthe clauses 'it thought, may I be many, may\n\np. 159\n\n[paragraph continues] I grow forth', and 'it sent forth fire', establish that\none being (as the cause and substance of everything). If, then, it is said\nthat Brahman is that which is the root of the world's origination,\nsubsistence, and reabsorption, those three processes sufficiently indicate\nBrahman as that entity which is their material and operative cause; and as\nbeing the material and the operative cause implies greatness (b _ri_ hattva)\nmanifesting itself in various powers, such as omniscience, and so on, Brahman\nthus is something already known; and as hence origination, &c., of the world\nare marks of something already known, the objection founded above on the\nabsence of knowledge of another aspect of Brahman is seen to be invalid.--Nor\nis there really any objection to the origination, &c., of the world being\ntaken as characteristic marks of Brahman in so far as they are distinctive\nattributes. For taken as attributes they indicate Brahman as something\ndifferent from what is opposed to those attributes. Several attributes which\ndo not contradict each other may serve quite well as characteristic marks\ndefining one thing, the nature of which is not otherwise known, without the\nplurality of the attributes in any way involving plurality of the thing\ndefined; for as those attributes are at once understood to belong to one\nsubstrate, we naturally combine them within that one substrate. Such\nattributes, of course, as the possession of mutilated horns (mentioned above),\nwhich are contradictorily opposed to each other, necessarily lead to the\nassumption of several individual cows to which they severally belong; but the\norigination, &c., of the world are processes separated from each other by\ndifference of time only, and may therefore, without contradiction, be\nconnected with one Brahman in succession.--The text 'from whence these\nbeings', &c., teaches us that Brahman is the cause of the origination, &c., of\nthe world, and of this Brahman thus known the other text 'The True, knowledge,\nthe Infinite is Brahman', tells us that its essential nature marks it off from\neverything else. The term 'True' expresses Brahman in so far as possessing\nabsolutely non-conditioned existence, and thus distinguishes it from non-\nintelligent matter, the abode\n\np. 160\n\nof change, and the souls implicated in matter; for as both of these enter into\ndifferent states of existence called by different names, they do not enjoy\nunconditioned being. The term 'knowledge' expresses the characteristic of\npermanently non-contracted intelligence, and thus distinguishes Brahman from\nthe released souls whose intelligence is sometimes in a contracted state. And\nthe term 'Infinite' denotes that, whose nature is free from all limitation of\nplace, time, and particular substantial nature; and as Brahman's essential\nnature possesses attributes, infinity belongs both to the essential nature and\nto the attributes. The qualification of Infinity excludes all those individual\nsouls whose essential nature and attributes are not unsurpassable, and who are\ndistinct from the two classes of beings already excluded by the two former\nterms (viz. 'true being' and 'knowledge').--The entire text therefore defines\nBrahman--which is already known to be the cause of the origination, &c., of\nthe world--as that which is in kind different from all other things; and it is\ntherefore not true that the two texts under discussion have no force because\nmutually depending on each other. And from this it follows that a knowledge of\nBrahman may be gained on the ground of its characteristic marks--such as its\nbeing the cause of the origination, &c., of the world, free from all evil,\nomniscient, all-powerful, and so on.\n\nTo those, on the other hand, who maintain that the object of enquiry is a\nsubstance devoid of all difference, neither the first nor the second Sutra can\nbe acceptable; for the Brahman, the enquiry into which the first Sutra\nproposes, is, according to authoritative etymology, something of supreme\ngreatness; and according to the second Sutra it is the cause of the origin,\nsubsistence, and final destruction of the world. The same remark holds good\nwith regard to all following Sutras, and the scriptural texts on which they\nare based--none of them confirm the theory of a substance devoid of all\ndifference. Nor, again, does Reasoning prove such a theory; for Reasoning has\nfor its object things possessing a 'proving' attribute which constantly goes\ntogether with an attribute 'to be proved.'\n\np. 161\n\n[paragraph continues] And even if, in agreement with your view, we explained\nthe second Sutra as meaning 'Brahman is that whence proceeds the error of the\norigination, &c., of the world', we should not thereby advance your theory of\na substance devoid of all difference. For, as you teach, the root of all error\nis Nescience, and Brahman is that which witnesses (is conscious of) Nescience,\nand the essence of witnessing consciousness consists in being pure light\n(intelligence), and the essence of pure light or intelligence is that,\ndistinguishing itself from the Non-intelligent, it renders itself, as well as\nwhat is different from it, capable of becoming the object of empiric thought\nand speech (vyavahara). All this implies the presence of difference--if there\nwere no difference, light or intelligence could not be what it is, it would be\nsomething altogether void, without any meaning.--Here terminates the adhikara\n_n_ a of 'origination and so on.'\n\nAn objection to the purport of the preceding Sutras here presents itself.--The\nassertion that Brahman, as the cause of the origination, &c., of the world,\nmust be known through the Vedanta-texts is unfounded; for as Brahman may be\ninferred as the cause of the world through ordinary reasoning, it is not\nsomething requiring to be taught by authoritative texts.--To this objection\nthe next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 3.
