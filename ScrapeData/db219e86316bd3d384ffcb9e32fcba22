We must take\nit for granted that it could not be otherwise; that creation must be\nimperfect, must be gradual, and that it is futile to ask the question, Why we\nare?\n\nBut this is the real question we ought to ask: Is this imperfection the final\ntruth, is evil absolute and ultimate? The river has its boundaries, its banks,\nbut is a river all banks? or are the banks the final facts about the river? Do\nnot these obstructions themselves give its water an onward motion? The towing\nrope binds a boat, but is the bondage its meaning? Does it not at the same\ntime draw the boat forward?\n\nThe current of the world has its boundaries, otherwise it could have no\nexistence, but its purpose is not shown in the boundaries which restrain it,\nbut in its movement, which is towards perfection. The wonder is not that there\nshould be obstacles and sufferings in this world, but that there should be law\nand order, beauty and joy, goodness and love. The idea of God that man has in\nhis being is the wonder of all wonders. He has felt in the depths of his life\nthat what appears as imperfect is the manifestation of the perfect; just as a\nman who has an ear for music realises the perfection of a song, while in fact\nhe is only listening to a succession of notes. Man has found out the great\nparadox that what is limited is not imprisoned within its limits; it is ever\nmoving, and therewith shedding its finitude every moment. In fact,\nimperfection is not a negation of perfectness; finitude is not contradictory\nto infinity: they are but completeness manifested in parts, infinity revealed\nwithin bounds.\n\nPain, which is the feeling of our finiteness, is not a fixture in our life. It\nis not an end in itself, as joy is. To meet with it is to know that it has no\npart in the true permanence of creation. It is what error is in our\nintellectual life. To go through the history of the development of science is\nto go through the maze of mistakes it made current at different times. Yet no\none really believes that science is the one perfect mode of disseminating\nmistakes. The progressive ascertainment of truth is the important thing to\nremember in the history of science, not its innumerable mistakes. Error, by\nits nature, cannot be stationary; it cannot remain with truth; like a tramp,\nit must quit its lodging as soon as it fails to pay its score to the full.\n\nAs in intellectual error, so in evil of any other form, its essence is\nimpermanence, for it cannot accord with the whole. Every moment it is being\ncorrected by the totality of things and keeps changing its aspect. We\nexaggerate its importance by imagining it as a standstill. Could we collect\nthe statistics of the immense amount of death and putrefaction happening every\nmoment in this earth, they would appal us. But evil is ever moving; with all\nits incalculable immensity it does not effectually clog the current of our\nlife; and we find that the earth, water, and air remain sweet and pure for\nliving beings. All statistics consist of our attempts to represent\nstatistically what is in motion; and in the process things assume a weight in\nour mind which they have not in reality. For this reason a man, who by his\nprofession is concerned with any particular aspect of life, is apt to magnify\nits proportions; in laying undue stress upon facts he loses his hold upon\ntruth. A detective may have the opportunity of studying crimes in detail, but\nhe loses his sense of their relative places in the whole social economy. When\nscience collects facts to illustrate the struggle for existence that is going\non in the kingdom of life, it raises a picture in our minds of "nature red in\ntooth and claw." But in these mental pictures we give a fixity to colours and\nforms which are really evanescent. It is like calculating the weight of the\nair on each square inch of our body to prove that it must be crushingly heavy\nfor us. With every weight, however, there is an adjustment, and we lightly\nbear our burden. With the struggle for existence in nature there is\nreciprocity. There is the love for children and for comrades; there is the\nsacrifice of self, which springs from love; and this love is the positive\nelement in life.\n\nIf we kept the search-light of our observation turned upon the fact of death,\nthe world would appear to us like a huge charnel- house; but in the world of\nlife the thought of death has, we find, the least possible hold upon our\nminds. Not because it is the least apparent, but because it is the negative\naspect of life; just as, in spite of the fact that we shut our eyelids every\nsecond, it is the openings of the eye that count. Life as a whole never takes\ndeath seriously. It laughs, dances and plays, it builds, hoards and loves in\ndeath\'s face. Only when we detach one individual fact of death do we see its\nblankness and become dismayed. We lose sight of the wholeness of a life of\nwhich death is part. It is like looking at a piece of cloth through a\nmicroscope. It appears like a net; we gaze at the big holes and shiver in\nimagination. But the truth is, death is not the ultimate reality. It looks\nblack, as the sky looks blue; but it does not blacken existence, just as the\nsky does not leave its stain upon the wings of the bird.\n\nWhen we watch a child trying to walk, we see its countless failures; its\nsuccesses are but few. If we had to limit our observation within a narrow\nspace of time, the sight would be cruel. But we find that in spite of its\nrepeated failures there is an impetus of joy in the child which sustains it in\nits seemingly impossible task. We see it does not think of its falls so much\nas of its power to keep its balance though for only a moment.\n\nLike these accidents in a child\'s attempts to walk, we meet with sufferings in\nvarious forms in our life every day, showing the imperfections in our\nknowledge and our available power, and in the application of our will. But if\nthese revealed our weakness to us only, we should die of utter depression.\nWhen we select for observation a limited area of our activities, our\nindividual failures and miseries loom large in our minds; but our life leads\nus instinctively to take a wider view. It gives us an ideal of perfection\nwhich ever carries us beyond our present limitations. Within us we have a hope\nwhich always walks in front of our present narrow experience; it is the\nundying faith in the infinite in us; it will never accept any of our\ndisabilities as a permanent fact; it sets no limit to its own scope; it dares\nto assert that man has oneness with God; and its wild dreams become true every\nday.\n\nWe see the truth when we set our mind towards the infinite. The ideal of truth\nis not in the narrow present, not in our immediate sensations, but in the\nconsciousness of the whole which give us a taste of what we _should_ have in\nwhat we _do_ have. Consciously or unconsciously we have in our life this\nfeeling of Truth which is ever larger than its appearance; for our life is\nfacing the infinite, and it is in movement. Its aspiration is therefore\ninfinitely more than its achievement, and as it goes on it finds that no\nrealisation of truth ever leaves it stranded on the desert of finality, but\ncarries it to a region beyond. Evil cannot altogether arrest the course of\nlife on the highway and rob it of its possessions. For the evil has to pass\non, it has to grow into good; it cannot stand and give battle to the All. If\nthe least evil could stop anywhere indefinitely, it would sink deep and cut\ninto the very roots of existence. As it is, man does not really believe in\nevil, just as he cannot believe that violin strings have been purposely made\nto create the exquisite torture of discordant notes, though by the aid of\nstatistics it can be mathematically proved that the probability of discord is\nfar greater than that of harmony, and for one who can play the violin there\nare thousands who cannot. The potentiality of perfection outweighs actual\ncontradictions. No doubt there have been people who asserted existence to be\nan absolute evil, but man can never take them seriously. Their pessimism is a\nmere pose, either intellectual or sentimental; but life itself is optimistic:\nit wants to go on. Pessimism is a form of mental dipsomania, it disdains\nhealthy nourishment, indulges in the strong drink of denunciation, and creates\nan artificial dejection which thirsts for a stronger draught. If existence\nwere an evil, it would wait for no philosopher to prove it. It is like\nconvicting a man of suicide, while all the time he stands before you in the\nflesh. Existence itself is here to prove that it cannot be an evil.\n\nAn imperfection which is not all imperfection, but which has perfection for\nits ideal, must go through a perpetual realisation. Thus, it is the function\nof our intellect to realise the truth through untruths, and knowledge is\nnothing but the continually burning up of error to set free the light of\ntruth. Our will, our character, has to attain perfection by continually\novercoming evils, either inside or outside us, or both; our physical life is\nconsuming bodily materials every moment to maintain the life fire; and our\nmoral life too has its fuel to burn. This life process is going on--we know\nit, we have felt it; and we have a faith which no individual instances to the\ncontrary can shake, that the direction of humanity is from evil to good. For\nwe feel that good is the positive element in man\'s nature, and in every age\nand every clime what man values most is his ideals of goodness. We have known\nthe good, we have loved it, and we have paid our highest reverence to men who\nhave shown in their lives what goodness is.\n\nThe question will be asked, What is goodness; what does our moral nature mean?\nMy answer is, that when a man begins to have an extended vision of his self,\nwhen he realises that he is much more than at present he seems to be, he\nbegins to get conscious of his moral nature. Then he grows aware of that which\nhe is yet to be, and the state not yet experienced by him becomes more real\nthan that under his direct experience. Necessarily, his perspective of life\nchanges, and his will takes the place of his wishes. For will is the supreme\nwish of the larger life, the life whose greater portion is out of our present\nreach, most of whose objects are not before our sight. Then comes the conflict\nof our lesser man with our greater man, of our wishes with our will, of the\ndesire for things affecting our senses with the purpose that is within our\nheart. Then we begin to distinguish between what we immediately desire and\nwhat is good. For good is that which is desirable for our greater self. Thus\nthe sense of goodness comes out of a truer view of our life, which is the\nconnected view of the wholeness of the field of life, and which takes into\naccount not only what is present before us but what is not, and perhaps never\nhumanly can be. Man, who is provident, feels for that life of his which is not\nyet existent, feels much more that than for the life that is with him;\ntherefore he is ready to sacrifice his present inclination for the unrealised\nfuture. In this he becomes great, for he realises truth. Even to be\nefficiently selfish one has to recognise this truth, and has to curb his\nimmediate impulses--in other words, has to be moral. For our moral faculty is\nthe faculty by which we know that life is not made up of fragments,\npurposeless and discontinuous. This moral sense of man not only gives him the\npower to see that the self has a continuity in time, but it also enables him\nto see that he is not true when he is only restricted to his own self. He is\nmore in truth than he is in fact. He truly belongs to individuals who are not\nincluded in his own individuality, and whom he is never even likely to know.\nAs he has a feeling for his future self which is outside his present\nconsciousness, so he has a feeling for his greater self which is outside the\nlimits of his personality. There is no man who has not this feeling to some\nextent, who has never sacrificed his selfish desire for the sake of some other\nperson, who has never felt a pleasure in undergoing some loss or trouble\nbecause it pleased somebody else. It is a truth that man is not a detached\nbeing, that he has a universal aspect; and when he recognises this he becomes\ngreat. Even the most evilly-disposed selfishness has to recognise this when it\nseeks the power to do evil; for it cannot ignore truth and yet be strong. So\nin order to claim the aid of truth, selfishness has to be unselfish to some\nextent. A band of robbers must be moral in order to hold together as a band;\nthey may rob the whole world but not each other. To make an immoral intention\nsuccessful, some of its weapons must be moral. In fact, very often it is our\nvery moral strength which gives us most effectively the power to do evil, to\nexploit other individuals for our own benefit, to rob other people of their\nrights. The life of an animal is unmoral, for it is aware only of an immediate\npresent; the life of a man can be immoral, but that only means that it must\nhave a moral basis. What is immoral is imperfectly moral, just as what is\nfalse is true to a small extent, or it cannot even be false. Not to see is to\nbe blind, but to see wrongly is to see only in an imperfect manner. Man\'s\nselfishness is a beginning to see some connection, some purpose in life; and\nto act in accordance with its dictates requires self-restraint and regulation\nof conduct. A selfish man willingly undergoes troubles for the sake of the\nself, he suffers hardship and privation without a murmur, simply because he\nknows that what is pain and trouble, looked at from the point of view of a\nshort space of time, are just the opposite when seen in a larger perspective.\nThus what is a loss to the smaller man is a gain to the greater, and _vice\nversa_.\n\nTo the man who lives for an idea, for his country, for the good of humanity,\nlife has an extensive meaning, and to that extent pain becomes less important\nto him. To live the life of goodness is to live the life of all. Pleasure is\nfor one\'s own self, but goodness is concerned with the happiness of all\nhumanity and for all time. From the point of view of the good, pleasure and\npain appear in a different meaning; so much so, that pleasure may be shunned,\nand pain be courted in its place, and death itself be made welcome as giving a\nhigher value to life. From these higher standpoints of a man\'s life, the\nstandpoints of the good, pleasure and pain lose their absolute value. Martyrs\nprove it in history, and we prove it every day in our life in our little\nmartyrdoms. When we take a pitcherful of water from the sea it has its weight,\nbut when we take a dip into the sea itself a thousand pitchersful of water\nflow above our head, and we do not feel their weight. We have to carry the\npitcher of self with our strength; and so, while on the plane of selfishness\npleasure and pain have their full weight, on the moral plane they are so much\nlightened that the man who has reached it appears to us almost superhuman in\nhis patience under crushing trails, and his forbearance in the face of\nmalignant persecution.\n\nTo live in perfect goodness is to realise one\'s life in the infinitive. This\nis the most comprehensive view of life which we can have by our inherent power\nof the moral vision of the wholeness of life. And the teaching of Buddha is to\ncultivate this moral power to the highest extent, to know that our field of\nactivities is not bound to the plane of our narrow self. This is the vision of\nthe heavenly kingdom of Christ. When we attain to that universal life, which\nis the moral life, we become freed from the bonds of pleasure and pain, and\nthe place vacated by our self becomes filled with an unspeakable joy which\nsprings from measureless love. In this state the soul\'s activity is all the\nmore heightened, only its motive power is not from desires, but in its own\njoy. This is the _Karma-yoga_ of the _Gita_ , the way to become one with the\ninfinite activity by the exercise of the activity of disinterested goodness.\n\nWhen Buddha mentioned upon the way of realising mankind from the grip of\nmisery he came to this truth: that when man attains his highest end by merging\nthe individual in the universal, he becomes free from the thraldom of pain.\nLet us consider this point more fully.\n\nA student of mine once related to me his adventure in a storm, and complained\nthat all the time he was troubled with the feeling that this great commotion\nin nature behaved to him as if he were no more than a mere handful of dust.\nThat he was a distinct personality with a will of his own had not the least\ninfluence upon what was happening.\n\nI said, "If consideration for our individuality could sway nature from her\npath, then it would be the individuals who would suffer most."\n\nBut he persisted in his doubt, saying that there was this fact which could not\nbe ignored--the feeling that I am. The "I" in us seeks for a relation which is\nindividual to it.\n\nI replied that the relation of the "I" is with something which is "not-I." So\nwe must have a medium which is common to both, and we must be absolutely\ncertain that it is the same to the "I" as it is to the "not-I."\n\nThis is what needs repeating here. We have to keep in mind that our\nindividuality by its nature is impelled to seek for the universal. Our body\ncan only die if it tries to eat its own substance, and our eye loses the\nmeaning of its function if it can only see itself.\n\nJust as we find that the stronger the imagination the less is it merely\nimaginary and the more is it in harmony with truth, so we see the more\nvigorous our individuality the more does it widen towards the universal. For\nthe greatness of a personality is not in itself but in its content, which is\nuniversal, just as the depth of a lake is judged not by the size of its cavity\nbut by the depth of its water.\n\nSo, if it is a truth that the yearning of our nature is for reality, and that\nour personality cannot be happy with a fantastic universe of its own creation,\nthen it is clearly best for it that our will can only deal with things by\nfollowing their law, and cannot do with them just as it pleases. This\nunyielding sureness of reality sometimes crosses our will, and very often\nleads us to disaster, just as the firmness of the earth invariably hurts the\nfalling child who is learning to walk. Nevertheless it is the same firmness\nthat hurts him which makes his walking possible. Once, while passing under a\nbridge, the mast of my boat got stuck in one of its girders. If only for a\nmoment the mast would have bent an inch or two, or the bridge raised its back\nlike a yawning cat, or the river given in, it would have been all right with\nme. But they took no notice of my helplessness. That is the very reason why I\ncould make use of the river, and sail upon it with the help of the mast, and\nthat is why, when its current was inconvenient, I could rely upon the bridge.\nThings are what they are, and we have to know them if we would deal with them,\nand knowledge of them is possible because our wish is not their law. This\nknowledge is a joy to us, for the knowledge is one of the channels of our\nrelation with the things outside us; it is making them our own, and thus\nwidening the limit of our self.\n\nAt every step we have to take into account others than ourselves. For only in\ndeath are we alone. A poet is a true poet when he can make his personal idea\njoyful to all men, which he could not do if he had not a medium common to all\nhis audience. This common language has its own law which the poet must\ndiscover and follow, by doing which he becomes true and attains poetical\nimmortality.\n\nWe see then that man\'s individuality is not his highest truth; there is that\nin him which is universal. If he were made to live in a world where his own\nself was the only factor to consider, then that would be the worst prison\nimaginable to him, for man\'s deepest joy is in growing greater and greater by\nmore and more union with the all. This, as we have seen, would be an\nimpossibility if there were no law common to all. Only by discovering the law\nand following it, do we become great, do we realise the universal; while, so\nlong as our individual desires are at conflict with the universal law, we\nsuffer pain and are futile.\n\nThere was a time when we prayed for special concessions, we expected that the\nlaws of nature should be held in abeyance for our own convenience. But now we\nknow better. We know that law cannot be set aside, and in this knowledge we\nhave become strong. For this law is not something apart from us; it is our\nown. The universal power which is manifested in the universal law is one with\nour own power. It will thwart us where we are small, where we are against the\ncurrent of things; but it will help us where we are great, where we are in\nunison with the all. Thus, through the help of science, as we come to know\nmore of the laws of nature, we gain in power; we tend to attain a universal\nbody. Our organ of sight, our organ of locomotion, our physical strength\nbecomes world-wide; steam and electricity become our nerve and muscle. Thus we\nfind that, just as throughout our bodily organisation there is a principle of\nrelation by virtue of which we can call the entire body our own, and can use\nit as such, so all through the universe there is that principle of\nuninterrupted relation by virtue of which we can call the whole world our\nextended body and use it accordingly. And in this age of science it is our\nendeavour fully to establish our claim to our world-self. We know all our\npoverty and sufferings are owing to our inability to realise this legitimate\nclaim of ours. Really, there is no limit to our powers, for we are not outside\nthe universal power which is the expression of universal law. We are on our\nway to overcome disease and death, to conquer pain and poverty; for through\nscientific knowledge we are ever on our way to realise the universal in its\nphysical aspect. And as we make progress we find that pain, disease, and\npoverty of power are not absolute, but that is only the want of adjustment of\nour individual self to our universal self which gives rise to them.\n\nIt is the same with our spiritual life. When the individual man in us chafes\nagainst the lawful rule of the universal man we become morally small, and we\nmust suffer. In such a condition our successes are our greatest failures, and\nthe very fulfilment of our desires leaves us poorer. We hanker after special\ngains for ourselves, we want to enjoy privileges which none else can share\nwith us. But everything that is absolutely special must keep up a perpetual\nwarfare with what is general. In such a state of civil war man always lives\nbehind barricades, and in any civilisation which is selfish our homes are not\nreal homes, but artificial barriers around us. Yet we complain that we are not\nhappy, as if there were something inherent in the nature of things to make us\nmiserable. The universal spirit is waiting to crown us with happiness, but our\nindividual spirit would not accept it. It is our life of the self that causes\nconflicts and complications everywhere, upsets the normal balance of society\nand gives rise to miseries of all kinds. It brings things to such a pass that\nto maintain order we have to create artificial coercions and organised forms\nof tyranny, and tolerate infernal institutions in our midst, whereby at every\nmoment humanity is humiliated.\n\nWe have seen that in order to be powerful we have to submit to the laws of the\nuniversal forces, and to realise in practice that they are our own. So, in\norder to be happy, we have to submit our individual will to the sovereignty of\nthe universal will, and to feel in truth that it is our own will. When we\nreach that state wherein the adjustment of the finite in us to the infinite is\nmade perfect, then pain itself becomes a valuable asset. It becomes a\nmeasuring rod with which to gauge the true value of our joy.\n\nThe most important lesson that man can learn from his life is not that there\n_is_ pain in this world, but that it depends upon him to turn it into good\naccount, that it is possible for him to transmute it into joy. The lesson has\nnot been lost altogether to us, and there is no man living who would willingly\nbe deprived of his right to suffer pain, for that is his right to be a man.\nOne day the wife of a poor labourer complained bitterly to me that her eldest\nboy was going to be sent away to a rich relative\'s house for part of the year.\nIt was the implied kind intention of trying to relieve her of her trouble that\ngave her the shock, for a mother\'s trouble is a mother\'s own by her\ninalienable right of love, and she was not going to surrender it to any\ndictates of expediency. Man\'s freedom is never in being saved troubles, but it\nis the freedom to take trouble for his own good, to make the trouble an\nelement in his joy. It can be made so only when we realise that our individual\nself is not the highest meaning of our being, that in us we have the world-man\nwho is immortal, who is not afraid of death or sufferings, and who looks upon\npain as only the other side of joy. He who has realised this knows that it is\npain which is our true wealth as imperfect beings, and has made us great and\nworthy to take our seat with the perfect. He knows that we are not beggars;\nthat it is the hard coin which must be paid for everything valuable in this\nlife, for our power, our wisdom, our love; that in pain is symbolised the\ninfinite possibility of perfection, the eternal unfolding of joy; and the man\nwho loses all pleasure in accepting pain sinks down and down to the lowest\ndepth of penury and degradation. It is only when we invoke the aid of pain for\nour self-gratification that she becomes evil and takes her vengeance for the\ninsult done to her by hurling us into misery. For she is the vestal virgin\nconsecrated to the service of the immortal perfection, and when she takes her\ntrue place before the altar of the infinite she casts off her dark veil and\nbares her face to the beholder as a revelation of supreme joy.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV: The Problem of Self](sadh06.htm)\n\n'
