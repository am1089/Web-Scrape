And on account of non-connectedness there is no confusion.\n\nAlthough the souls, as being parts of Brahman and so on, are of essentially\nthe same character, they are actually separate, for each of them is of atomic\nsize and resides in a separate body. For this reason there is no confusion or\nmixing up of the individual spheres of enjoyment and experience. The Sutrakara\nintroduces this reference to an advantage of his own view of things, in order\nto intimate that the views of the soul being Brahman deluded or else Brahman\naffected by a limiting adjunct are on their part incapable of explaining how\nit is that the experiences of the individual Self and the highest Self, and of\nthe several individual Selfs, are not mixed up.\n\nBut may not, on the view of the soul being Brahman deluded, the distinction of\nthe several spheres of experience be explained by means of the difference of\nthe limiting adjuncts presented by Nescience?--This the next Sutra negatives.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 49.
