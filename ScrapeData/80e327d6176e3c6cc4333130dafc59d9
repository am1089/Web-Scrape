b"[![](../../cdshop/cdinfo.jpg)](../../cdshop/index.htm)  \n[Sacred Texts](../../index.htm)  [Hinduism](../index.htm)  [Index](index.htm)\n[Previous](sbe0828.htm)  [Next](sbe0830.htm)\n\n* * *\n\n# CHAPTER II.\n\nVasudeva 2 said\n\nThen grasping his feet, Ka _s_ yapa, asked questions very difficult to\nexplain, and all of them that (being), the best of the supporters of piety,\ndid explain.\n\nKa _s_ yapa, said:\n\nHow does the body perish, and how, too, is it produced? How does one who moves\nin this harassing course of worldly life become freed? And (how) does the\nself, getting rid of nature, abandon the body (produced) from it 3? And how,\nbeing freed from the body, does he attain to the other 4? How does this man\nenjoy the good and evil acts done by himself? And where do the acts of one who\nis released from the body remain?\n\nThe Brahma _n_ a said:\n\nThus addressed, O descendant of V _ri_ sh _n_ i! that Siddha answered these\nquestions in order. Hear me relate what (he said).\n\np. 236\n\nThe Siddha said:\n\nWhen those actions, productive of long life and fame 1, which a man performs\nhere, are entirely exhausted, after his assumption of another body, he\nperforms (actions of an) opposite character, his self being overcome at the\nexhaustion of life 2. And his ruin being impending, his understanding goes\nastray. Not knowing his own constitution, 3, and strength, and likewise the\n(proper) season, the man not being self-controlled, does unseasonably what is\ninjurious to himself When he attaches himself to numerous very harassing\n(actions); eats too much 4, or does not eat at all; when he takes bad food, or\nmeat 5, or drinks, or (kinds of food) incompatible with one another, or heavy\nfood in immoderate quantities, or without (previously taken food) being\nproperly digested; or takes too much exercise, or is incontinent; or\nconstantly, through attachment to action, checks the regular course (of the\nexcretions 6); or takes juicy food 7; or sleeps by day 8; or (takes food) not\nthoroughly prepared; (such a man) himself aggravates the disorders\n\np. 237\n\norders (in the body) when the time comes 1. By aggravating the disorders (in)\nhis own (body), he contracts a disease which ends in death, or he even engages\nin unreasonable (acts), such as hanging 2 (oneself). From these causes, the\nliving 3 body of that creature then perishes. Learn about that correctly as I\nam about to state it. Heat being kindled in the body, and being urged by a\nsharp wind 4, pervades the whole frame, and, verily, checks the (movements of\nall the) life-winds. Know this truly, that excessively powerful heat, if\nkindled in the body, bursts open the vital parts-the seats of the Soul 5. Then\nthe soul, full of torments, forthwith falls away from the perishable (body).\nKnow, O best of the twice-born! that (every) creature leaves the body, when\nthe vital parts are burst open, its self being overcome with torments. All\nbeings are constantly distracted with birth and death; and, O chief of the\ntwice-born! are seen abandoning (their) bodies; or entering the womb on the\nexhaustion of (their previous) actions 6. Again, a man suffers similar\ntorments, having his joints broken and suffering from\n\np. 238\n\ncold, in consequence of water 1. As the compact association of the five\nelements is broken up, the wind in the body, distributed within the five\nelements 2, between the upward and downward life-winds, being aggravated by\ncold, and urged by a sharp wind 3, goes upwards 4, abandoning the embodied\n(self) in consequence of pain. Thus it 5 leaves the body, which appears devoid\nof breath. Then devoid of warmth, devoid of breath, devoid of beauty, and with\nconsciousness destroyed, the man, being abandoned by the Brahman 6, is said to\nbe dead. (Then) he ceases to perceive (anything) with those very currents 7\nwith which the supporter of the body 8 perceives objects of sense. In the same\nway, it is the eternal soul which preserves in the body the life-winds which\nare produced from food 9. Whatever (part of the body) is employed in the\ncollection 10 of that, know\n\np. 239\n\nthat to be a vital part, for thus it is seen (laid down) in the Scriptures.\nThose vital parts being wounded, that (wind) directly comes out therefrom, and\nentering the bosom of a creature obstructs the heart 1. Then the possessor of\nconsciousness knows nothing 2. Having his knowledge enveloped by darkness 3,\nwhile the vitals are still enveloped, the soul 4, being without a fixed seat,\nis shaken about by the wind. And then he heaves a very deep and alarming gasp,\nand makes the unconscious body quiver as he goes out (of it). That soul,\ndropping out of the body, is surrounded on both sides by his own actions 5,\nhis own pure and meritorious, as also his sinful (ones). Brahma _n_ as,\npossessed of knowledge, whose convictions are correctly (formed) from sacred\nlearning, know him by (his) marks as one who has performed meritorious actions\nor the reverse. As those who have eyes see a glow-worm disappear here and\nthere in darkness, so likewise do those who have eyes of knowledge. Such a\nsoul, the Siddhas see with a divine eye, departing (from the body), or coming\nto the birth, or entering into a womb 6. Its three descriptions 7 of seats are\nhere learnt from the Scriptures. This world is the world of actions 8, where\n\np. 240\n\ncreatures dwell. All embodied (selfs), having here performed good or evil\n(actions), obtain (the fruit). It is here they obtain higher or lower\nenjoyments by their own actions. And it is those whose actions here are evil,\nwho by their actions go to, hell. Harassing is that lower place where men are\ntormented. Freedom from it is very difficult, and the self should be specially\nprotected from it. Learn from me now the seats in which creatures going up 1\ndwell, and which I shall describe truly. Hearing this, you will learn the\nhighest knowledge, and decision regarding action 2. All (the worlds in) the\nforms of stars, and this lunar sphere 3, and also this solar sphere which\nshines in the world by its own lustre, know these to be the seats of men who\nperform meritorious actions. All these, verily, fall down again and again in\nconsequence of the exhaustion of their actions 4 . And there, too, in heaven,\nthere are differences of low, high, and middling, 5. Nor, even there, is there\nsatisfaction, (even) after a sight of most magnificent splendour. Thus have I\nstated to you these seats distinctly. I will after this (proceed to) state to\nyou the production of the f\xc2\x9ctus 6. And, O twice-born one! hear that\nattentively from me as I state it.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[235:1](sbe0828.htm#fr_1071) This was difficult, as the Siddha possessed\nextraordinary powers, such as that of concealed movement, &c.\n\n[235:2](sbe0829.htm#fr_1072) Sic in MSS.\n\n[235:3](sbe0829.htm#fr_1073) Cf. as to getting rid of nature, Gita, pp.\n[75](sbe0809.htm#page_75)-[106](sbe0815.htm#page_106). As to the body produced\nfrom nature, cf. ibid. [p. 112](sbe0817.htm#page_112), and pp.\n[317](sbe0847.htm#page_317)-[318](sbe0848.htm#page_318) infra.\n\n[235:4](sbe0829.htm#fr_1074) I. e. the Brahman, says Nilaka _nth_ a.\n\n[236:1](sbe0829.htm#fr_1075) One reading omits 'fame,' as to which cf.\nTaittiriya-upanishad, p. 129; _Kh_ andogya, pp. 122-227. As to long life, cf.\n_Kh_ andogya, p. 272; exhausted, i.e. by enjoyment of fruit in another world.\n\n[236:2](sbe0829.htm#fr_1076) Cf. _S_ ariraka Bhashya, p. 753 seq., where we\nhave a slightly different view.\n\n[236:3](sbe0829.htm#fr_1077) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra renders the original,\nsattva, by svabhava.\n\n[236:4](sbe0829.htm#fr_1078) Cf. for all this, Gita, pp.\n[62](sbe0806.htm#page_62), [69](sbe0808.htm#page_69),\n[118](sbe0819.htm#page_118), which passages, however, are from a slightly\ndifferent point of view. See also Khandogya, p. 526.\n\n[236:5](sbe0829.htm#fr_1079) A various reading here excludes meat. But cf.\n\xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 2, 23; Gautama II, 13.\n\n[236:6](sbe0829.htm#fr_1080) So says Nilaka _nth_ a.\n\n[236:7](sbe0829.htm#fr_1081) I. e. which turns to juice in digestion, much\njuice being a cause of indigestion, say the commentators.\n\n[236:8](sbe0829.htm#fr_1082) This is doubtful. The sense may be, 'who takes\njuicy or not thoroughly prepared food by day and night.' But see \xc3\x82 _s_\nvalayana Grihya-sutra, p. 90; \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 2, 24; Gautama II, 13.\n\n[237:1](sbe0829.htm#fr_1083) The time of destruction, says Ar _g_ una Mi _s_\nra.\n\n[237:2](sbe0829.htm#fr_1084) Which, say the commentators, leads to death, even\nwithout any disease.\n\n[237:3](sbe0829.htm#fr_1085) So I construe the original, having regard to the\nquestion, I how does the body perish?' The other reading, which is in some\nrespects better, is equivalent to 'the life falls away from the body of that\ncreature.'\n\n[237:4](sbe0829.htm#fr_1086) This is different, as the commentators point out,\nfrom the ordinary life-winds.\n\n[237:5](sbe0829.htm#fr_1087) The original here is _g_ iva, not atman, which we\nhave rendered 'self.' This refers rather to the vital principle. As to the\nseats, cf. Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya Sm _ri_ ti III, 93 seq.\n\n[237:6](sbe0829.htm#fr_1088) I adopt the reading karma _n_ am, which I find in\none of the MSS. I consulted. I think it probable that that was the reading\nbefore the commentators. The other reading is marma _n_ am.\n\n[238:1](sbe0829.htm#fr_1089) Having spoken of heat, he now speaks of the\neffects of cold. I am not sure if the water here refers to the water of the\njuicy' substances before referred to.\n\n[238:2](sbe0829.htm#fr_1090) This means, I presume, within the dissolving\nbody. Cf. Maitri-upanishad, p. 42.\n\n[238:3](sbe0829.htm#fr_1091) See note  4, last page.\n\n[238:4](sbe0829.htm#fr_1092) To the head, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[238:5](sbe0829.htm#fr_1093) That is, the wind, I suppose, and then the breath\ndeparts from the body, and the man is said to die. 'Devoid of beauty,' further\non, means, disfigured in the state of death.\n\n[238:6](sbe0829.htm#fr_1094) I. e. the mind, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[238:7](sbe0829.htm#fr_1095) The senses. Cf. _S_ veta _s_ vatara, p. 288.\n\n[238:8](sbe0829.htm#fr_1096) See and cf. [p. 262](sbe0833.htm#page_262) infra.\n\n[238:9](sbe0829.htm#fr_1097) This, says Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, is in answer to\nthe possible question why this 'sharp wind' does not work with the life-winds.\nThe answer is, that such working requires the presence of the soul, which Ar\n_g_ una Mi _s_ ra says here means 'mind.' As to production from food,' cf.\n_Kh_ andogya, p. 421 seq., and Taittiriya \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka, p. 893.\n\n[238:10](sbe0829.htm#fr_1098) Collection of that = turning the food into\nsemen, says Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, who adds, 'in, those vital parts, which are\nuseful for this purpose, the life-wind dwells.'\n\n[239:1](sbe0829.htm#fr_1099) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra renders this to mean 'mind.'\n\n[239:2](sbe0829.htm#fr_1100) As the mind is obstructed, says Ar _g_ una Mi _s_\nra. The possessor of consciousness = the self, Ar _g_ una.\n\n[239:3](sbe0829.htm#fr_1101) I. e. pain, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[239:4](sbe0829.htm#fr_1102) I. e. mind, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[239:5](sbe0829.htm#fr_1103) Cf. B _ri_ hadara _ny_ aka, p. 843.\n\n[239:6](sbe0829.htm#fr_1104) See Aitareya-upanishad, p. 222, and _S_ a _n_\nkara's commentary there. The coming to the birth is the coming out of the womb\ninto the world. Cf. also Gita, [p. 112](sbe0817.htm#page_112).\n\n[239:7](sbe0829.htm#fr_1105) As stated further on, viz. this world, the next\nworld, and the womb. With this compare _Kh_ andogya, p. 359.\n\n[239:8](sbe0829.htm#fr_1106) Cf. our Bhart _ri_ hari (Bombay series), Notes\n(Niti _s_ ataka), p. 27.\n\n[240:1](sbe0829.htm#fr_1107) Cf. on this and lower place,' Gita, [p.\n109](sbe0816.htm#page_109); Sa _n_ khya Karika, 44.\n\n[240:2](sbe0829.htm#fr_1108) The readings here are most unsatisfactory. The\nmeaning of the printed reading adopted above would seem to be, 'decision as to\nwhat actions should be performed,' &c.\n\n[240:3](sbe0829.htm#fr_1109) Cf. Gita, [p. 81](sbe0810.htm#page_81), and\nSanatsu _g_ atiya, [p. 158](sbe0823.htm#page_158).\n\n[240:4](sbe0829.htm#fr_1110) Cf. Gita, [p. 84](sbe0811.htm#page_84).\n\n[240:5](sbe0829.htm#fr_1111) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says, 'In heaven = in the\nnext world, low = inferior(?), high = heaven, and middling = the space below\nthe skies (antariksha).' For the three degrees of enjoyment in heaven, see\nYogavasish _th_ a I, 35 seq.\n\n[240:6](sbe0829.htm#fr_1112) This is the third of the three seats above\nreferred to.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter III](sbe0830.htm)\n\n"
