He desired,\n'May I exist, may I reproduce myself!' He toiled, he practised austerity (or,\nbecame heated). From him, worn out and heated, the waters were created: from\nthat heated Person the waters are born.\n\n6:1:3:22\\. The waters said, 'What is to become of us?'--'Ye shall be heated,'\nhe said. They were heated; they created foam: hence foam is produced in heated\nwater.\n\n6:1:3:33\\. The foam (m.) said, 'What is to become of me?'--'Thou shalt be\nheated!' he said. It was heated, and produced clay; for indeed the foam is\nheated, when it floats on the water, covering it; and when one beats upon it,\nit indeed becomes clay.\n\n6:1:3:44\\. The clay (f.) said, 'What is to become of me?'--'Thou shalt be\nheated!' he said. It was heated,\n\np. 158\n\nand produced sand; for this clay becomes indeed heated when they plough it;\nand if only they plough very fine then it becomes, as it were, sandy. So much,\nthen, as to that 'What is to become of me? what is to become of me 1?'\n\n6:1:3:55\\. From the sated he created the pebble: whence sand finally indeed\nbecomes a pebble;--from the pebble the stone: whence the pebble finally indeed\nbecomes a stone;--from the stone metal ore: whence from stone they smelt\nore;--from ore gold: whence ore much smelted comes, as it were, to have the\nappearance of gold.\n\n6:1:3:66\\. Now that which was created was flowing; and inasmuch as it was\nflowing (aksharat), a syllable (akshara) resulted therefrom; and inasmuch as\nit flowed eight times, that octosyllabic Gayatri was produced.\n\n6:1:3:77\\. 'This has indeed become (bhu) a foundation (resting-place),' so he\nthought: whence it became the earth (bhumi). He spread it out (prath): it\nbecame the broad (earth, p _ri_ thivi). On this earth, as on a foundation, the\nbeings, and the lord of beings, consecrated themselves for a year: the lord of\nbeings was the master of the house 2, and Ushas (the Dawn) was the mistress.\n\n6:1:3:88\\. Now, those beings are the seasons; and that lord of beings is the\nyear; and that Ushas, the mistress, is the Dawn. And these same creatures, as\nwell as the lord of beings, the year, laid seed\n\np. 159\n\ninto Ushas 1. There a boy (kumara) was born in a year: he cried.\n\n6:1:3:99\\. Pra _g_ apati said to him, 'My boy, why criest thou, when thou art\nborn out of labour and trouble?' He said, 'Nay, but I am not freed from\n(guarded against) evil; I have no name given me: give me a name!' Hence one\nshould give a name to the boy that is born, for thereby one frees him from\nevil;--even a second, even a third (name), for thereby one frees him from evil\ntime after time.\n\n6:1:3:1010\\. He said to him, 'Thou art Rudra 2.' And because he gave him that\nname, Agni became suchlike (or, that form), for Rudra is Agni: because he\ncried (rud) therefore he is Rudra. He said, 'Surely, I am mightier than that:\ngive me yet a name!'\n\n6:1:3:1111\\. He said to him, 'Thou art Sarva.' And because he gave the him\nthat name, the waters became suchlike, for Sarva is the waters, inasmuch as\nfrom the water everything (sarva) here is produced. He said, 'Surely, I am\nmightier than that: give me yet a name!'\n\n6:1:3:1212\\. He said to him, 'Thou art Pa _s_ upati.' And because he gave him\nthat name, the plants became suchlike, for Pa _s_ upati is the plants: hence\nwhen cattle (pa _s_ u) get plants, then they play the master 3 (patiy). He\nsaid, 'Surely, I am mightier than that: give me yet a name!'\n\n6:1:3:1313\\. He said to him, 'Thou art Ugra.' And\n\np. 160\n\nbecause he gave him that name, Vayu (the wind) became suchlike, for Ugra is\nVayu: hence when it blows strongly, they say 'Ugra is blowing.' He said,\n'Surely, I am mightier than that: give me yet a name!'\n\n6:1:3:1414\\. He said to him, 'Thou art A _s_ ani.' And because he gave him\nthat name, the lightning became suchlike, for A _s_ ani is the lightning:\nhence they say of him whom the lightning strikes, 'A _s_ ani has smitten him.'\nHe said, 'Surely, I am mightier than that: give me yet a name!'\n\n6:1:3:1515\\. He said to him, 'Thou art Bhava.' And because he gave him that\nname, Par _g_ anya (the rain-god) became suchlike; for Bhava is Par _g_ anya,\nsince everything here comes (bhavati) from the rain-cloud. He said, 'Surely, I\nam mightier than that: give me yet a name!'\n\n6:1:3:1616\\. He said to him, 'Thou art Mahan Deva _h_ (the Great God).' And\nbecause he gave him that name, the moon became suchlike, for the moon is Pra\n_g_ apati, and Pra _g_ apati is the Great God. He said, 'Surely, I am mightier\nthan that: give me yet a name!'\n\n6:1:3:1717\\. He said to him, 'Thou art \xc3\x8e _s_ ana (the Ruler).' And because he\ngave him that name, the Sun became suchlike, for \xc3\x8e _s_ ana is the Sun, since\nthe Sun rules over this All. He said, 'So great indeed I am: give me no other\nname after that!'\n\n6:1:3:1818\\. These then are the eight forms of Agni. Kumara (the boy) is the\nninth: that is Agni's threefold state 1.\n\n6:1:3:1919\\. And because there are eight forms of Agni--\n\np. 161\n\nthe Gayatri consisting of eight syllables--therefore they say, 'Agni is\nGayatra.' That boy entered into the forms one after another; for one never\nsees him as a mere boy (kumara), but one sees those forms of his 1, for he\nassumed those forms one after another.\n\n6:1:3:2020\\. One ought to build him (Agni, the fire-altar) up in (the space\nof) a year, and recite for a year. 'For two (years),' however, say some; 'for\nin one year they laid the seed, and in one year that boy was born, therefore\nlet him build for two (years), and recite for two (years).' Let him, however,\nbuild for a year only, and recite for a year; for the same seed which is laid\nis brought forth; it then lies changing and growing: hence let him build for a\nyear only, and recite for a year. To him (Agni) when built up ( _k_ ita) he\ngives a name: whereby he keeps away evil from him. He calls him by a bright (\n_k_ itra) name 2, saying, 'Thou art bright;' for Agni is all bright things.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[158:1](sbe4130.htm#fr_320) He means to say that he will leave this to be\nsupplied in the enumeration of the subsequent creations.\n\n[158:2](sbe4130.htm#fr_321) At sacrificial sessions the Sacrificer is called G\n_ri_ hapati. On this, see IV, 6, 8, 3-5.\n\n[159:1](sbe4130.htm#fr_322) On the legend regarding Pra _g_ apati and his\ndaughter Ushas, see I, 7, 4, 1 seq.\n\n[159:2](sbe4130.htm#fr_323) On this and several of the other names, see part\ni, p. 201.\n\n[159:3](sbe4130.htm#fr_324) As, when a horse gets much corn, it becomes\nspirited, 'masterful.' The St. Petersburg dictionary suggests the meaning,\n'they become strong.' It might also mean, 'they lord it (over the plants).'\n\n[160:1](sbe4130.htm#fr_325) That is, his state of being triv _ri_ t, or three\ntimes three.\n\n[161:1](sbe4130.htm#fr_326) Tata _s_ _k_ a tatprabh _ri_ ti tam Agnim\nkumararupa _m_ na kva _k_ ana pa _s_ yanti ki _m_ tv etany eta _g_ gvalanadini\nrupa _n_ y apurushavidhani pa _s_ yanti, Say.\n\n[161:2](sbe4130.htm#fr_327) Or, he calls him by the name of _K_ itra (bright),\nthat being the name by which he is actually to address the fire on the altar\nat the end of the performance.
