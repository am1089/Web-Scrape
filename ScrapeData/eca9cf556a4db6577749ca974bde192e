By means of the Seasonal sacrifices, Pra _g_ apati fashioned for\nhimself a body. The sacrificial food for the Vai _s_ vadeva 2 sacrifice he\nmade to be this\n\np. 75\n\nright arm of his; the oblation to Agni thereof this thumb; that to Soma this\n(fore-finger); and that to Savit _ri_ this (middle finger).\n\n11:5:2:22\\. That cake (to Savit _ri_ ), doubtless, is the largest, and hence\nthis (middle finger) is the largest of these (fingers). That (oblation) to\nSarasvati is this (third) finger; and that to Pushan this (little finger). And\nthat (oblation) to the Maruts is this joint above the hand (the wrist); and\nthat to the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_ is this (elbow 1); and that to Heaven and Earth\nis this arm: this (oblation) is indistinct 2, whence that limb also is\nindistinct 3.\n\n11:5:2:33\\. The Varu _n_ apraghasa 4 offerings are this right leg,--the five\noblations which this has in common (with the other Seasonal offerings) are\nthese five toes; and the oblation to Indra and Agni is the knuckles: this\n(oblation) belongs to two deities\n\np. 76\n\nwhence there are these two knuckles. That (oblation) to Varu _n_ a is this\n(shank); that to the Maruts this (thigh); and that (cake) to Ka is this back-\nbone: this (oblation) is indistinct, whence that (back-bone) is indistinct.\n\n11:5:2:44\\. The offering to (Agni) Anikavat (of the Sakamedha _h_  1),\ndoubtless, is his (Pra _g_ apati's) mouth, for the mouth is the extreme end\n(anika) of the vital airs; the Sa _m_ tapaniya (pap) is the chest, for by the\nchest one is, as it were, confined 2 (sa _m_ -tap); the G _ri_ hamedhiya (pap)\nis the belly--to serve as a foundation, for the belly is a foundation; the\nKrai _d_ ina oblation is the male organ, for it is therewith that (man) sports\n(kri _d_ ), as it were; and the offering to Aditi 3 is this downward\nbreathing.\n\n11:5:2:55\\. The Great Oblation, indeed, is this left leg,--the five oblations\nwhich it has in common (with the other Seasonal offerings) are these five\ntoes; and the oblation to Indra and Agni is the knuckles: this (oblation)\nbelongs to two deities whence there are\n\np. 77\n\nthese two knuckles. The (oblation) to Mahendra is this (shank); that to Vi _s_\nvakarman this (thigh): this (oblation) is indistinct, whence this (thigh) also\nis indistinct.\n\n11:5:2:66\\. The _S_ unasiriya 1, doubtless, is this left arm,--the five\noblations which it has in common (with the other Seasonal offerings) are these\nfive fingers; the _S_ unasiriya is that joint of his above the hand; that\n(oblation) to Vayu is this (elbow); that to Surya this arm: this (oblation) is\nindistinct, whence this (limb) also is indistinct.\n\n11:5:2:77\\. Now these Seasonal offerings are tripartite and furnished with two\njoints 2, whence these limbs of man are tripartite and furnished with two\njoints. Two of these four (sacrifices) have each three indistinct (low-voiced)\noblations; and two of them have two each 3.\n\n11:5:2:88\\. At all four of them they churn out the fire,\n\np. 78\n\nwhence (the draught animal) pulls with all four limbs. At two of them they\nlead (the fire) forward 1, whence it (the animal) walks on two (feet at a\ntime) 2. Thus, then, Pra _g_ apati fashioned for himself a body by means of\nthe Seasonal sacrifices; and in like manner does the Sacrificer who knows this\nfashion for himself a (divine) body by means of the Seasonal sacrifices.\n\n11:5:2:99\\. As to this they say, 'The Vai _s_ vadeva oblation (should have)\nall (its formulas) in the Gayatri, the Varu _n_ apraghasa _h_ all in the Trish\n_t_ ubh, the Great Oblation all in the _G_ agati, and the _S_ unasiriya all in\nthe Anush _t_ ubh metre, so as to yield a Katush _t_ oma 3.' But let him not\ndo this, for inasmuch as (his formulas) amount to these (metres) even thereby\nthat wish is obtained.\n\n11:5:2:1010\\. Now, indeed, (the formulas of) these Seasonal offerings. amount\nto three hundred and sixty-two B _ri_ hati verses 4: he thereby obtains both\nthe year 5\n\np. 79\n\nand the Mahavrata 1; and thus, indeed, this Sacrificer also has a twofold 2\nfoundation, and he thus makes the Sacrificer reach the heavenly world, and\nestablishes him therein.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[74:2](sbe44026.htm#fr_250) The Vai _s_ vadeva, or first of the four seasonal\nsacrifices, requires the following oblations:--1. a cake on eight potsherds to\nAgni; 2. a pap to Soma; 3. a cake on twelve or eight potsherds to p. 75 Savit\n_ri_ ; 4. a pap to Sarasvati; 5. a pap to Pushan--these first five oblations\nrecur at all seasonal offerings;--6. a cake on seven potsherds to the Maruts;\n7. a dish of clotted curds to the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_ ; 8. a cake on one\npotsherd to Heaven and Earth.\n\n[75:1](sbe44026.htm#fr_251) It would rather seem that what is intended here by\n'sa _m_ dhi' is not the joints themselves, but the limbs (in the anatomical\nsense) between the articulations. Similarly in 'trishandhi' in [parag.\n7](sbe44026.htm#11:5:2:7).\n\n[75:2](sbe44026.htm#fr_252) That is to say, it is a low-voiced offering, the\ntwo formulas, with the exception of the final Om and Vausha _t_ , being\npronounced in a low voice. All cakes on one potsherd are (except those to Varu\n_n_ a) of this description; Katy. _S_ r. IV, 5, 3; \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_ r. II, 15, 5;\ncf. _S_ at. Br. II, 4, 3, 8.\n\n[75:3](sbe44026.htm#fr_253) That is, not clearly defined; the word 'dos,'\nwhich is more usually restricted to the fore-arm, being also used for the\nwhole arm, and even the upper arm.\n\n[75:4](sbe44026.htm#fr_254) The Varu _n_ apraghasa _h_ , or second seasonal\nsacrifice, has the following oblations:--1-5. the common oblations; 6. a cake\non twelve potsherds to Indra and Agni; 7. 8. two dishes of clotted curds for\nVaru _n_ a and the Maruts respectively; 9. a cake on one potsherd for Ka (Pra\n_g_ apati).\n\n[76:1](sbe44026.htm#fr_255) The Sakamedha _h_ , or third seasonal sacrifice,\nconsists of the following oblations:--1. a cake on eight potsherds to Agni\nAnikavat; 2. 3. paps to the Maruta _h_ Sa _m_ tapana _h_ and Maruta _h_ G _ri_\nhamedhina _h_ ; 4. a cake on seven potsherds to the Maruta _h_ Kri _d_ ina _h_\n; 5. a pap to Aditi. Then follows the Great Oblation consisting of 6-10, the\nfive common oblations; 11. a cake on twelve potsherds to Indra and Agni; 12. a\npap to Mahendra; and 13. a cake on one potsherd to Vi _s_ vakarman. Then\nfollows the Pit _ri_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a.\n\n[76:2](sbe44026.htm#fr_256) Or, according to Saya _n_ a, one gets oppressed or\nheated on account of the close proximity of the heart and the digestive fire,\n--urasa h _ri_ daya-sambandha _g_ _g_ a _th_ arasannive _s_ a _k_ _k_ a sa _m_\ntapana-vishayatvam.\n\n[76:3](sbe44026.htm#fr_257) This offering of a cake to Aditi, mentioned in\nKaty. Sr. V, 7, 2, is not referred to in the Brahma _n_ a's account of the\nSakamedha _h_ , see II, 5, 3, 20.\n\n[77:1](sbe44026.htm#fr_258) The Sunasiriya, or last Seasonal offering,\nconsists of--1-5. the common oblations; 6. the _S_ unasiriya cake on twelve\npotsherds; 7. a milk oblation to Vayu; 8. a cake on one potsherd to Surya.\n\n[77:2](sbe44026.htm#fr_259) The Seasonal offerings are performed so as to\nleave an interval of four months between them; the fourth falling exactly a\nyear after the first; hence the whole performance consists, as it were, of\nthree periods of four months each, with two joints between\nthem;--corresponding to the formation of the arms and legs.\n\n[77:3](sbe44026.htm#fr_260) Of the five oblations common to the four\nsacrifices, one--viz. the cake to Savit _ri_ \\--is a low-voiced offering\n(Katy. Sr. IV, 5, 5; \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_ r. II, 15, 7), as are also the one-kapala\ncakes of which there is one in each sacrifice. According to Saya _n_ a the\nfirst and last Seasonal sacrifices have only these two Upam _s_ uya _g_ as,\nwhilst the second and third have each one additional low-voiced oblation, but\nhe does not specify them. This is, however, a mistake, as Katyayana, _S_ r.\nIV, 5, 6. 7, states distinctly, that the two additional low-voiced oblations\nare the Vai _s_ vadevi payasya in the first, and the oblation to Vayu in the\nlast, _K_ aturmasya.\n\n[78:1](sbe44026.htm#fr_261) According to Saya _n_ a this refers to the first\nand last Seasonal sacrifices, inasmuch as there is no uttaravedi required for\nthese, and hence only the simple leading forward of the fire to the \xc3\x82havaniya\nhearth; whilst the commentary on Katy. V, 4, 6, on the contrary, refers it\njust to the other two, because a double leading forth takes place there.\n\n[78:2](sbe44026.htm#fr_262) Or, as Saya _n_ a takes it, man walks on two feet.\n\n[78:3](sbe44026.htm#fr_263) The _K_ atush _t_ oma, properly speaking, is the\ntechnical term for such an arrangement of the Stotras of a Soma-sacrifice by\nwhich they are chanted on stomas, or hymn-forms, increasing successively by\nfour verses. Two such arrangements (of four and six different stomas\nrespectively) are mentioned, one for an Agnish _t_ oma sacrifice, and the\nother for a Sho _d_ a _s_ in. See note on [XIII, 3, 1,\n4](sbe44094.htm#13:3:1:4).\n\n[78:4](sbe44026.htm#fr_264) These 362 B _ri_ hati verses (of 36 syllables\neach) would amount to 13,032 syllables; and, verses of the four metres\nreferred to amounting together to 148 syllables, this amount is contained in\nthe former 88 times, leaving only eight over; so slight a discrepancy being\nconsidered of no account in such calculations.\n\n[78:5](sbe44026.htm#fr_265) That is, a year of 360 days; and if, as is done by\nSaya _n_ a (in p. 79 accordance with the calculations in Book X), the year is\nidentified with the fire-altar, a mahavedi containing 360 Ya _g_ ushmati\nbricks.\n\n[79:1](sbe44026.htm#fr_266) Saya _n_ a reminds us that the Mahavrata-saman\nconsists of five parts in five different stomas (Triv _ri_ t, &c., see part\niv, p. 282, note 4), the verses of which, added up (9, 15, 17, 25, 21), make\n87, which amount is apparently, in a rough way, to be taken as identical with\nthat of 88 obtained in note 4 of last page.\n\n[79:2](sbe44026.htm#fr_267) Viz. inasmuch as the total amount of B _ri_ hatis\n(362) exceeds by two the number of days in the year.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 5, 3.
