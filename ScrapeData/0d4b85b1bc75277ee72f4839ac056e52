blest to be  \nThe mother of a son like thee!  \nI know thee well, O chieftain, now:  \nRama, the prince of men, art thou.  \nThere stands the high-born Maithil dame,  \nThere Lakshman, lord of mighty fame.  \nMy name was Tumburu  1, for song  \nRenowned among the minstrel throng:  \nCursed by Kuvera's stern decree  \nI wear the hideous shape you see.  \nBut when I sued, his grace to crave,  \nThe glorious God this answer gave:  \n'When Rama, Das'aratha's son,  \nDestroys thee and the light is won,  \nThy proper shape once more assume,  \nAnd heaven again shall give thee room.'  \nWhen thus the angry God replied,  \nNo prayers could turn his wrath aside,  \nAnd thus on me his fury fell  \nFor loving Rambha's  2 charms too well.  \nNow through thy favour am I freed  \nFrom the stern fate the God decreed,  \nAnd saved, O tamer of the foe,  \n\np. 233  \n\nBy thee, to heaven again shall go.  \nA league, O Prince, beyond this spot  \nStands holy S'arabhanga's cot:  \nThe very sun is not more bright  \nThan that most glorious anchorite:  \nTo him, O Rama, quickly turn,  \nAnd blessings from the hermit earn.  \nFirst under earth my body throw,  \nThen on thy way rejoicing go.  \nSuch is the law ordained of old  \nFor giants when their days are told:  \nTheir bodies laid in earth, they rise  \nTo homes eternal in the skies.'  \n   Thus, by the rankling dart oppressed,  \nKakutstha's offspring he addressed:  \nIn earth his mighty body lay,  \nHis spirit fled to heaven away.  \n   Thus spake Viradha ere he died;  \nAnd Rama to his brother cried:  \n'Now dig we in this grove a pit  \nHis elephantine bulk to fit.  \nAnd let the hollowed earth enfold  \nThis mighty giant fierce and bold.'  \n   This said, the valiant hero put  \nUpon the giant's neck his foot.  \nHis spade obedient Lakshman plied,  \nAnd dug a pit both deep and wide  \nBy lofty souled Viradha's side.  \nThen Raghu's son his foot withdrew,  \nAnd down the mighty form they threw;  \nOne awful shout of joy he gave  \nAnd sank into the open grave.  \nThe heroes, to their purpose true,  \nIn fight the cruel demon slew,  \n   And radiant with delight  \nDeep in the hollowed earth they cast  \nThe monster roaring to the last,  \n   In their resistless might.  \nThus when they saw the warrior's steel  \nNo life-destroying blow might deal,  \n   The pair, for lore renowned,  \nDeep in the pit their hands had made  \nThe unresisting giant laid,  \n   And killed him neath the ground.  \nUpon himself the monster brought  \nFrom Rama's hand the death he sought  \n   With strong desire to gain:  \nAnd thus the rover of the night  \nTold Rama, as they strove in fight,  \nThat swords might rend and arrows smite  \n   Upon his breast in vain.  \nThus Rama, when his speech he heard,  \nThe giant's mighty form interred,  \n   Which mortal arms defied.  \nWith thundering crash the giant fell,  \nAnd rock and cave and forest dell  \n   With echoing roar replied.  \nThe princes, when their task was done  \nAnd freedom from the peril won,  \n   Rejoiced to see him die.  \nThen in the boundless wood they strayed,  \n\nLike the great sun and moon displayed  \n   Triumphant in the sky.
