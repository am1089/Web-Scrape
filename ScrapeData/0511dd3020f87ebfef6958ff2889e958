It was Sunday and the room was filled with a large number of\ndevotees. Among them was a young college student only nineteen years of age\nnamed Narendra, who afterwards became the world-renowned Swami Vivekananda.\nEveryone noticed even at that time that he was a sincere and earnest seeker\nafter Truth and that his mind was above all worldly concerns. His eyes were\nshining with spiritual light, his face was aglow with innocence and\nsimplicity, and his words were full of spiritual power. The Bhagavan was\ndiscoursing on worldly people who ridicule the worshippers of God. Especially\naddressing Narendra, He asked: What do you say, Narendra? Worldly\n\np. 37\n\nmen will speak all manner of things against godly people, but they should act\nlike the elephant. When an elephant passes through a public road, dogs run\nafter him and bark at him; but the elephant turns a deaf ear to their barking\nand goes on his own way. Suppose, my boy, people should speak ill of you\nbehind your back, what would you think of them?\n\nNarendra: I would look upon them as a lot of barking dogs.\n\nGod dwells in all.The Bhagavan laughed and said: No, my friend, do not go so\nfar as that. You should love everyone; no one is a stranger; God dwells in all\nbeings; without Him nothing can exist. When Prahlada * realized Him, the Lord\nasked him to crave a boon. Prahlada replied: "When I have seen Thee, what\nother boon do I need?" The Lord asked him again. He then prayed: "If Thou\nwishest to grant me a boon, do Thou forgive those who have persecuted me."\nPrahlada meant that by persecuting him they had persecuted the Lord dwelling\nwithin him. Know that God resides in all things animate and inanimate. Hence\neverything is an object of worship, be\n\np. 38\n\nit men, beasts or birds, plants or minerals In our relation with men all that\nwe can do is to take heed to ourselves that we mix with good people and avoid\nbad company. It is true, however, that God resides in bad people also, yes,\neven in a tiger; but surely it does not follow that we should embrace a tiger.\nIt may be asked: Why should we run away from a tiger when God is dwelling in\nthat form? To this the answer is that God abiding in our hearts directs us to\nrun away from the tiger. Why should we not obey His will?\n\nParable of the disciple and the mad elephant.In a certain forest there lived a\nsage who had a number of disciples. He taught his disciples the truth: "God\ndwells in all things. Knowing this, you should bend your knee before every\nobject." One day a disciple went out into the forest for wood. On his way he\nsaw a man riding a mad elephant and shouting: "Get out of the way, get out of\nthe way! This is a mad elephant." The disciple, instead of running away,\nremembered his master\'s teaching and began to reason: "God is in the elephant\nas well as in me. God cannot be hurt by God, so why should I run away?" Thus\nthinking, he stood where he was and saluted the elephant\n\np. 39\n\nas he came nearer. The driver (Mahoot) kept on shouting: "Get out of the way!"\nbut the disciple would not move, until he was snatched up by the mad elephant\nand dashed to one side. The poor boy, bruised and bleeding, lay on the ground\nunconscious. The sage, hearing of the accident, came with his other disciples\nto carry him home. When after some time the unfortunate pupil recovered\nconsciousness, he described what had happened. The sage replied: My boy, it is\ntrue that God is manifest in everything. But if He is in the elephant, is He\nnot equally manifest in the driver (Mahoot)? Tell me why you did not pay heed\nto the warning of the driver?\n\nGod in everything.The Bhagavan continued: In the sacred Scriptures it is\nwritten, "God dwells in water"; but some water can be used for divine service,\nor for drinking purposes, some for bathing or washing, while dirty water\ncannot be touched even. In the same manner, although God resides in all human\nbeings, still there are good men and bad men, there are lovers of God and\nthose who do not love God. We should recognize Divinity in all, but we should\nnot mix with bad people or with those who do not love God. Our relation with\n\np. 40\n\nthem must not be very close. It is wise to avoid the company of such people.\n\nNarendra: * What attitude should we hold when wicked people come to disturb\nour peace or do actually offend us?\n\nBhagavan: A person living in society should have a little Tamas (the spirit of\nresisting evil) Resistance of for purposes of self-protection. But evil this\nis necessary only for outward show, its object being to prevent the wicked\nfrom doing harm to you. At the same time you should not do actual injury to\nanother on the ground that he has done injury to you.\n\nParable of the snake and the holy man.There was a large venomous snake in a\nfield. No one dared to go that way. One day a holy man (Mahatma) passed by\nthat road and the serpent  ran after the sage to bite him. But when the snake\napproached the holy man, he lost all his ferocity and was overpowered by the\ngentleness of the Yogi. Seeing him, the sage said: "Well, my friend, think you\nto bite me?" The snake was abashed and made no reply. At this the sage\ncontinued: "Hearken, friend; do not injure anyone in future." The snake bowed\nand nodded\n\np. 41\n\nassent. The sage went his way, and the snake entered his hole and\nthenceforward began to live a life of innocence, without attempting to harm\nanyone. In a few days all the neighborhood concluded that the snake had lost\nhis venom and was no longer dangerous; so everyone began to tease him. They\npelted him with stones or dragged him mercilessly by the tail, and there was\nno end to his troubles. Fortunately the sage again passed that way, and seeing\nthe bruised and battered condition of the snake, was very much moved and\ninquired the cause. "Holy Sir," the snake replied, "this is because I do not\ninjure anyone after your advice. But alas! they are so merciless!" The sage\nsmilingly said: "My friend, I simply advised you not to bite anyone; but I did\nnot tell you not to frighten others. Although you should not bite any living\ncreature, still you should keep people at a distance by hissing at them." And\nSri Ramakrishna added: There is no harm in "hissing" at wicked men and at your\nenemies, showing that you can protect yourself and know how to resist evil.\nOnly you must be careful not to pour your venom into the blood of your enemy.\nResist not evil by causing evil in return.\n\np. 42\n\nLove for all.One of the devotees present said: But when a person is annoyed\nwith me, Bhagavan, I feel unhappy. I feel that I have not been able to love\neveryone equally.\n\nRamakrishna: When you feel that way, you should have a talk with that person\nand try to make peace with him. If you fail after such attempts, then you need\nnot give it further thought. Take refuge with the Lord. Think upon Him. Do not\nlet your mind be disturbed by any other thing.\n\nDevotee: Christ and Chaitanya have both taught us to love all mankind.\n\nA true devotee always calm.Ramakrishna: You should love everyone because God\ndwells in all beings. But to wicked people you should bow down at a distance.\n(To Bijoy, smiling) Is it true that people blame you because you mix with\nthose who believe in a Personal God with form? A true devotee of God should\npossess absolute calmness and never be disturbed by the opinions of others.\nLike a blacksmith\'s anvil, he will endure all blows and persecutions. and yet\nremain firm in his faith and always the same. Company of  the wicked.Wicked\npeople may say many things about you and blame you; but if you long for God,\nyou should endure with patience.\n\np. 43\n\n[paragraph continues] One can think on God even dwelling in the midst of\nwicked people. The sages of ancient times, who lived in forests, could\nmeditate on God although surrounded by tigers, hears, and other wild beasts.\nThe nature of the wicked is like that of a tiger or bear. They attack the\ninnocent and injure them. You should he especially cautious in coming in\ncontact with the following: First, the wealthy. A person who possesses wealth\nand many attendants can easily do harm to another if he so desires. You should\nbe very guarded in speaking with him; sometimes it may even be necessary to\nagree with him in his opinion. Second, a dog. When a dog barks at you, you\nmust not run, but talk to him and quiet him. Third a bull. When a bull chases\nyou, you should always pacify him by talking to him. Fourth a drunkard. If you\nmake him angry, he will call you names and swear at you. You should address\nhim as a dear relative, then he will be happy and obliging.\n\nWhen wicked people come to see me, I am very careful. The character of some of\nthem is like that of a snake. They may bite you unawares. It may take a long\ntime and much discrimination to recover from the effects of\n\np. 44\n\nthat bite. Or you may get so angry at them that you will wish to take revenge.\nIt is necessary, however, to keep occasionally the company of holy men.\nThrough such association right discrimination will come.\n\nFour classes of individual souls.There are four classes of _Jivas_ , or\nindividual souls: First, _Baddha_ , the bound; second, _Mumukshu_ , the seeker\nafter freedom; third, _Mukta_ , the emancipated; and fourth, _Nitya-mukta_ ,\nthe eternally free. This world is like a net, the soul is the fish, and the\nLord of the phenomenal world is the fisherman. When a fisherman draws in his\nnet, some of the fish try to escape by rending the net, that is, they struggle\nfor freedom. So are the souls of the second class, the _Mumukshus_ , the\nseekers after freedom. But among the fish that struggle, only a few escape.\nSimilarly, a few souls only attain to freedom and they belong to the third\nclass, the _Muktas_. There are some fish, however, that are naturally cautious\nand never fall into the net. Such are the souls of the fourth class, the\n_Nitya-muktas_ , who are never caught in the net of the phenomenal world, but\nwho remain eternally free, like Narada * and others like him. Most of the\nfish,\n\np. 45\n\nhowever, fall into the net and have not the sense to know that they are going\nto die there. When caught, they try to run away and hide in the mud at the\nbottom by swimming with the net. They make no effort to get out of the net,\nbut go deeper and deeper into the mud. These may be compared to the souls who\nare bound fast in the world. They are caught in the net, but they delude\nthemselves by thinking that they are happy. They remain attached to\nworldliness. They plunge into the mire of worldly evils and are content, while\nthose who are seeking after freedom or who are emancipated do not like\nworldliness and do not care for sense-pleasures.\n\nBound souls. Those who are thus caught in the net of the world are the\n_Baddha_ , or bound souls. No one can awaken them. They do not come to their\nsenses even after receiving blow upon blow of misery, sorrow and indescribable\nsuffering. The camel loves thorny bushes, and although his mouth bleeds when\nhe eats them, still he does not cease to love them dearly and no one can keep\nhim away from them. The bound souls may meet with great grief and misfortune,\nbut after a few days they are just as they were before. The wife\n\np. 46\n\nmay die or become unchaste, the man will marry again; his son may die, he will\nbe extremely sorrowful, but he will soon forget him. The mother of the boy may\nbe overwhelmed with grief for a short time, but in a few days she will once\nmore be concerned for her personal appearance and will deck herself with\njewels and finery. Such worldly people may be left paupers after marrying\ntheir sons and daughters, yet they will still beget children every year. They\nmay lose their fortune by a lawsuit, but they will again go to the courts.\nThey may not be able to support their children, to educate, feed, clothe, or\nhouse them properly, still they will continue to have more. They are like the\nsnake with a musk-rat in its mouth. As the snake cannot swallow the rat\nbecause of its strong odor, neither can it throw it out because of its own\nbent teeth, so these bound souls, _Baddhas_ , although they may occasionally\nfeel that the world is unreal, can neither give it up nor can they fix their\nminds on the Reality of the universe. I once saw a relative of Keshab Chunder\nSen, who was quite old, still playing cards as if the time for meditating on\nGod had not come for him.\n\nThere is another sign of a _Baddha_ , or worldly\n\np. 47\n\nsoul. If you remove him from the world and put him in a better place, he will\npine away and die. He will work like a slave to support his family, and he\nwill not hesitate to tell lies, to deceive or to flatter in order to earn his\nlivelihood. He looks upon those who worship God or who meditate on the Lord of\nthe universe as insane. He never finds time or opportunity to think of\nspiritual subjects. Even at the hour of death he will think and talk of\nworldly things. Whatever thought is strongest in the minds of worldly people\ncomes out at the time of death. If they become delirious, they rave of nothing\nbut material objects. They may go to places of worship, but so long as their\nminds are attached to the world, worldly thoughts will rise at the last\nmoment. As a parrot may be taught to utter the Lord\'s Holy Name, but when\nattacked by a cat, screams and gives its natural cry; so they may repeat the\nHoly Name of the Lord, but when attacked by death, the natural tendency of\ntheir minds will predominate. What thou thinkest thou shalt become.It is said\nin the Bhagavad Gita that the future is determined by the thought that is\nuppermost at the moment of death, and in the Purana there is a story that King\nBharata was born as a deer\n\np. 48\n\nbecause when he died, his mind was fixed on the thought of a deer. He who\npasses away thinking of God and meditating on Him, does not come back to this\nworld.\n\nA devotee: Bhagavan, will a man who thinks of God, but who does not meditate\non Him at the time of death, be born again?\n\nConcentration and meditationSri Ramakrishna: An ordinary soul who has no faith\nin God may think of Him for a time, but easily forgets Him again and becomes\nattached to the world. If, however, he concentrates his mind upon God at the\nlast moment of his life, his heart and soul become purified and remain so even\nafter death. People suffer on so much because they have no faith and in God.\nIn order to be able to think meditation. of God at the time of death we must\nprepare our mind by constant practice. The practice of meditation on God will\ncreate a tendency of mind to think of Him spontaneously even at the last\nmoment.\n\nA devotee: Bhagavan, what condition of mind is necessary for a worldly person\nto attain to freedom?\n\nRamakrishna: If by the Grace of the Lord strong dispassion for worldly things\narises in his mind, then such a person becomes free from\n\np. 49\n\nDispassion.all earthly attachment. What is this _strong_ dispassion? Let me\ntell you. Ordinary dispassion makes the mind think of the Lord occasionally,\nbut there is no longing in the heart. Strong dispassion, on the contrary,\nmakes the mind dwell constantly on the Lord with the same intense longing as a\nmother feels for her only child. He who has strong dispassion does not want\nanything but the Lord. He looks at the world as a deep well and is always\nfearful lest he may fall into it. Earthly relations seem to him very distant.\nHe does not seek their company. His whole heart and soul yearn for God. He\ndoes not think of his family, nor does he think of the morrow. He also\npossesses great spiritual force.\n\nParable of the farmer and the canal.Let me explain this to you by a parable:\nIn a certain place there had been a long drought. The farmers were irrigating\ntheir fields by canals, bringing water from a long distance. One farmer had\ngreat determination and force of character. One morning he made up his mind\nthat he would continue to dig his canal until he had connected it with the\nriver and brought the water to his field. He was so busy digging that he lost\naccount of time. The hour for luncheon came\n\np. 50\n\nand passed. His wife called him to come home, wash and eat. "The luncheon is\ngetting cold. Leave your work until to-morrow," she urged. At first he paid no\nheed to her words, but when she repeated her request, he bade her go home and\nnot disturb him any more. "You have no sense," he said, "with this terrible\ndrought we cannot grow anything. There will be no food for the children, the\nwhole family will die of starvation. I have resolved that this very day I\nshall bring the water of the river to my field; then I shall think of washing\nand eating." Hearing this, his wife ran home, The farmer worked hard the whole\nday and toward evening he joined the canal to the river and sat on one side\nwith great delight as he saw the stream of water running into his field. His\nmind was then peaceful and happy. He went home and called his wife, saying:\n"Now give me a little oil and fill my pipe," and he washed, ate a hearty\ndinner and enjoyed a sound sleep. This kind of determination and firmness of\npurpose must be at the back of strong dispassion. Another farmer who was\ntrying to bring water to his field was likewise called by his wife at the hour\nof the noonday meal. "It is getting late, come home, and wash\n\np. 51\n\nand eat," she said, and at once he dropped his spade and replied: "My dear,\nwhen you ask me to go, I must go." So his field remained dry. As a farmer\ncannot irrigate his field, so a devotee cannot attain to God without firm\ndetermination.\n\nWhen God is attained through such strong dispassion, all worldly attachment\nfades away. A householder may then live with his family, but he becomes\nunattached and there is no more danger for him. If there be two magnets, one\nvery large and the other very small, which do you suppose will attract a piece\nof iron? The larger one of course. God is the greatest magnet. Compared to Him\nthe attraction of the world is small and powerless.\n\nA devotee: Bhagavan, why are we so bound to the world that we cannot see God?\n\nSend of "I"Ramakrishna: The sense of "I" in us is the greatest obstacle in the\npath of God-vision. It covers the Truth. When "I" is dead, all troubles cease.\nIf by the mercy of the Lord one realizes "I am a non-doer," instantly that man\nbecomes emancipated in this life. This sense of "I" is like a thick cloud. As\na small cloud can hide the glorious sun, so this cloud of "I" hides the glory\nof the Eternal\n\np. 52\n\n[paragraph continues] Sun. If the cloud is dispersed by the mercy of a Guru,\nor spiritual master, the glory of Infinite becomes visible. When Rama, the\nDivine Incarnation in a human form, was walking in the forest, Lakshmana (the\nindividual soul), who was at a short distance, could not see Him because Sita\nor Maya, or the sense of "I," was standing between. Look at me. I cover my\nface with this handkerchief and you cannot see me; still my face is there. So\nGod is the nearest of all, but because of the sense of "I" you do not see Him.\nThe soul in its true nature is absolute Existence, Intelligence and Bliss, but\non account of Maya or the sense of "I," it has forgotten its real Self and has\nbecome entangled\' in the meshes of the various limitations of mind and body.\n\nMoney is power.Each attribute limits the soul and modifies its nature. He who\ndresses smartly will naturally sing love-songs, play cards and carry a cane,\nand such things will appeal to him. If you have a pencil in your hand, you\nwill unconsciously scribble on anything; such is the power of the pencil.\nMoney has great power. When a man becomes wealthy his nature is entirely\nchanged. He is a different being. A poor Brahmin, for instance,\n\np. 53\n\nused to come here. He was very humble. He lived on the other side of the\nGanges. One day as I was landing from a boat, I saw him sitting at the\nriverside. Seeing me, he shouted in a disrespectful tone, "Hello! is it you,\nmy good fellow?" Immediately I understood by his manner that he had got hold\nof some money, otherwise he would not dare to address me thus. A toad had a\nRupee in its hole. An elephant was coming that way and passed over the hole.\nThe toad was very angry; it came out and was about to kick the elephant,\nsaying: "How darest thou pass over me?" Such is the power of wealth! It makes\none so egotistic.\n\nSeven stages of spiritual evolution.This sense of "I," however, vanishes at\nthe approach of Divine wisdom, which leads to superconsciousness (Samadhi) and\neventually to God-consciousness. But it is very difficult to acquire this\nDivine wisdom. It is said in the Vedas that when the mind reaches the seventh\nstage of the spiritual evolution, the soul enters into Samadhi and instantly\nits sense of "I" disappears. The mind naturally dwells in the first three\nstages, the realm of worldly tendencies and animal propensities, and becomes\nattached to lust and\n\np. 54\n\nwealth. When the mind dwells in the purified heart, spiritual light is\nperceived by the soul. At that time the soul exclaims: "What is this! What is\nthis!" When it rises near the throat and remains there, the devotee loves to\nhear and speak of God. When the mind rises still higher, near the space\nbetween the eyebrows, it beholds the vision of the Infinite Being, whose\nnature is absolute Existence-Intelligence-Bliss. The soul then desires to\ntouch and embrace that Being, but fails. As a light within a lantern can be\nseen but cannot be touched from outside, so the soul beholds the vision but\ncannot lay hold on it. cannot enter into it, cannot become one with it. In the\nseventh stage, however, the mind is bereft of the sense of "I," enters into\nGod-consciousness and realizes its oneness with the Infinite.\n\nDevotee: Bhagavan, what happens after reaching the seventh stage when Divine\nwisdom comes? What does the man see?\n\nRamakrishna: It cannot be described by words. In the seventh stage when the\nmind goes into its causal form, Samadhi comes and what happens then no one can\ntell.\n\nThis sense of "I" which makes one worldly\n\np. 55\n\nDifference between soul and God.and attached to lust and wealth is the cause\nof bondage. The difference between the Supreme and the individual soul is\ncreated by this sense of "I" which stands between. If you hold a stick on the\nsurface of a stream, the water will appear to be divided into two parts, but\nin reality the water is one. It appears as two because of the stick. The sense\nof "I" may be compared to this stick. Remove this limiting adjunct and the\ncurrent will be one and unbroken. What is this sense of "I" which clings to\nman? That which says: "I am this, I am that. I possess so much wealth. I am\ngreat and powerful; who is greater than I?" If a thief has stolen ten Rupees\nand been detected, the owner takes his money first, then beats him, then hands\nhim over to the police and finally puts him in jail. The worldly "I."The\nworldly "I" says: "Doesn\'t he know that he stole ten Rupees which belonged to\nme? How dared he?"\n\nDevotee: Bhagavan, if we cannot get rid of worldliness except by losing the\nsense of "I" in Samadhi, is it not better to follow the path of wisdom which\nleads to Samadhi, since in the path of devotion the sense of "I" still\nremains?\n\np. 56\n\nDifficult to be  rid of "I."Ramakrishna: Very few can get rid of the sense of\n"I" through Samadhi. It generally clings to us. We may discriminate a thousand\ntimes, but the sense of "I" is bound to return again and again. You may cut\nthe branches of a fig-tree to-day, but to-morrow you will see that new twigs\nare sprouting. If this sense of "I" will not leave, then let it stay as the\nservant of God. "O God! Thou art my Lord, I am Thy servant!" Servant "I" of a\nBhakta.Think in this way: "I am His servant, I am His Bhakta, devotee." There\nis no harm in this kind of "I." Sweet things cause dyspepsia and acidity, but\ncrystallized sugar-candy is harmless. The path of wisdom is very difficult. It\ncannot be followed so long as the sense of "I" is connected with the body. In\nthis age the consciousness of the body and the sense of "I" cannot be overcome\neasily. But in the path of devotion, through prayer and the repetition of His\nHoly Name with extreme longing, God can be reached without fail.\n\nDevotee: Bhagavan, dost Thou teach us to renounce the worldly "I" and not the\nsense of the servant "I"?\n\nRamakrishna: Yes, the servant "I" or "I am the servant of God," "I am His\ndevotee,"\n\np. 57\n\nthis egoism is not bad but on the contrary it helps us to realize God.\n\nDevotee: Bhagavan, does he who has the sense of the servant "I" possess\npassion and anger?\n\nRamakrishna: If this attitude of a servant be genuine and perfect, then\npassion and anger will drop off leaving only a scar in the mind. This "I" of a\nBhakta or devotee does no harm to any living creature. It is like a sword\nwhich, after touching the Philosopher\'s Stone, is turned to gold. The sword\nretains the same form but it cannot cut or injure anyone. The dry leaves of\nthe cocoanut-tree drop off in the wind, leaving a mark on the trunk; that mark\nproves that there was a leaf there at one time. Similarly, the scar of the\nsense of "I" remains in the mind of one who has realized God, but his whole\nnature is transformed into that of an innocent child. A child\'s "I"The child\'s\nsense of "I" is not attached to worldly objects. He may like a thing at one\nmoment, but the next moment he may dislike it. You can take from him an object\nof great value by giving him a doll worth a penny. To a child everyone is\nequal, there is none greater or smaller. Therefore a child has no sense of\ncaste or creed. If his\n\np. 58\n\nmother says: "He is your brother," however low his caste may he, the child\nwill sit with him and eat with him without feeling dislike or difference of\nany kind.\n\nTrue devotion and love.Some Bhaktas after attaining to Samadhi or God-\nconsciousness, when they return, retain the sense of "I" as "I am His servant,\nI am His devotee." They do not lose the sense of "I" entirely but keep a small\nportion of it to repeat the Holy Name of the Lord, to sing His praises, to\nlove and serve Him. Again, those who constantly practise this sense of\n"servant I" eventually reach the Supreme Lord. This is the path of Bhakti or\ndevotion. But true devotion is very rare. True devotion leads to intense love\nfor God; and when that intense love comes, the Divine Being is not very far.\nIn that intense love the sense of worldliness is wiped out entirely and the\nwhole heart and soul rest upon nothing but the Lord of the universe. Some are\nborn with this intense love for God; it is natural with them. Its expression\nis to be found even in their childhood. At that tender age even, they cry for\nGod. There are many examples of such born Bhaktas like Prahlada and others.\nOrdinary devotion which is confined by scriptural\n\np. 59\n\nlaws of sacrifice and worship is preparatory. As in hot weather one fans\noneself for a breath of air so long as the breeze is not blowing, but when the\nbreeze springs up, the fan is no longer needed; so when the breeze of intense\nlove begins to blow in the soul, all devotional exercises like repetition of\nthe Name of the Lord, sacrifice, prayers and asceticism become unnecessary.\nDevotion without intense love is the sign of unripe Bhakti. When it ripens, it\nleads into Divine Love, which is perfect and which brings the highest\nrealization.\n\nA disciple: Bhagavan, how can God be realized?\n\nPure heart.Ramakrishna: God can be realized by the purified heart alone.\nOrdinarily the mind is stained with worldliness. God is like a magnet.The mind\nmay be compared to a needle. If a needle be covered with thick mud, it is not\nattracted by the magnet; but when the mud is washed off, the magnet attracts\nit. Power of repentance.Similarly, when the mind is covered with the mud of\nworldliness, it does not feel the attraction of the Lord; but whosoever\nrepents, saying: "O Lord, I shall never again commit such an act," and sheds\ntears of true repentance, washes off\n\np. 60\n\nall impurities and the magnet of the Lord then attracts the needle of the\nmind. Instantly superconsciousness comes and is followed by God-vision.\n\nThe mercy of the Lord.A man may make thousands of attempts, but nothing can be\naccomplished without the mercy of the Lord. Without His mercy no one can see\nHim. Nor is it an easy thing to obtain His mercy. The egotistic sense of "I"\nwhich says: "I am the doer," must be abandoned entirely before the Divine\nmercy can be felt. So long as there is a steward in charge of the storehouse,\nif any come to the master and beg him, saying: "Master, wilt thou not come to\nthe storehouse and give me this thing?" he will reply: "The steward is there,\nwhat need have I to go?" In like manner, so long as the ego thinks of himself\nas the "doer" and the master of the storehouse of the heart, the Real Master\ndoes not enter there. The mercy of the Lord is the surest way to God-vision.\nHe is the sun of wisdom. God, the Sun of Wisdom.A single ray of this Eternal\nSun illumines this world, and by that light we are conscious of ourselves and\nof one another and we acquire various kinds of knowledge. If He turns that\nlight towards His\n\np. 61\n\nIllustration of a bull\'s-eye lantern.own face, then He becomes visible to His\nBhakta or devotee.
