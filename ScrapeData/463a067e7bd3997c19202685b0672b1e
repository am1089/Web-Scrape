Now when Pra _g_ apati had\ncreated the living beings, his\n\np. 430\n\njoints were relaxed: with his relaxed joints he was unable to raise himself.\nThen the gods went on praising and toiling. They saw this Mahavratiya (cup)\nand drew it for him: thereby they restored his joints.\n\n4:6:4:22\\. With his joints thus restored, he approached this food, what food\nof Pra _g_ apati there is,--for what eating is to men, that the vrata (fast-\nfood, or religious observance generally) is to the gods. And because (they\nsay), 'Great, indeed, is this vrata whereby he has raised himself,' therefore\nit is called Mahavratiya.\n\n4:6:4:33\\. Now, even as Pra _g_ apati then was, when he had created the living\nbeings, so are those who sit (in sacrificial session) for a year; and as Pra\n_g_ apati then, after a year, approached food, so do they now, after a year,\napproach food, for whomsoever that knows this, they draw that cup.\n\n4:6:4:44\\. Let him draw it for Indra Vim _ri_ dh (the Averter of scorn), for,\nverily, the scorners of those who sit for\n\np. 431\n\na year are smitten, and all is won by them: hence for Indra Vim _ri_ dh,--with\n(Va _g_. S. VIII, 44; Rig-veda X, 152, 4), 'Scatter thou our scorners, O\nIndra, lay them low that war against us, and send them, that persecute us, to\nthe nethermost darkness!--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Indra Vim\n_ri_ dh!--This is thy womb: thee to Indra Vim _ri_ dh!'\n\n4:6:4:55\\. Or for Vi _s_ vakarman (the All-worker), for all work is done,\neverything is won by those who sit in session for a year: hence for Vi _s_\nvakarman,--with (Va _g_. S. VIII, 45; Rig-veda X, 81, 7), 'Va _k_ aspati Vi\n_s_ vakarman, the thought-speeder 1, let us invoke for protection in our\nstruggle 2 this day: may he, the all-beneficient worker of good, delight in\nall our offerings 3 for our protection!--Thou art taken with a support: thee\nto Indra Vi _s_ vakarman 4!--This is thy womb; thee to Indra Vi _s_ vakarman!'\n\n4:6:4:66\\. But if he knows the (verse) referring to Indra (and) Vi _s_\nvakarman, let him draw it thus 5 (Va _g_. S. VIII, 46), 'O Vi _s_ vakarman,\nwith strengthening libation madest thou Indra an invincible champion: to him\ndid the people bow down of\n\np. 432\n\nold, because 1 he, the mighty, is worthy of adoration.--Thou art taken with a\nsupport: thee to Indra Vi _s_ vakarman!--This is thy womb: thee to Indra Vi\n_s_ vakarman!'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[429:2](sbe2673.htm#fr_1001) The drawing of this cup forms part of the\nperformance of the last but one day of the Gavam ayana, the so-called\nMahavrata (great vow) day, on which the following particulars are supplied by\nKatyayana XIII, 2, 16 seq. The particular form of sacrifice prescribed for the\nday is the Agnish _t_ oma. A victim to Pra _g_ apati is to be immolated. The\nMahavratiya-graha is drawn as an additional libation (like the Atigrahyas,).\nThe signal for the chanting of the P _ri_ sh _th_ a-stotras is given by (a\nBrahman) playing, with a rattan plectrum, on a harp with a hundred strings of\np. 430 Mu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ a grass. During the chanting and recitation, the Udgat _ri_\nsits on an arm-chair, the Hot _ri_ on a hammock or swing, the Adhvaryu on a\nboard, and the other priests on cushions of grass. Then follow several curious\nceremonies, performed partly inside and partly outside the Vedi. The\nperformance of the Sattra is alternately lauded and vituperated by two persons\n[the one, a Brahman, seated at the front door of the Sadas; the other, a _S_\nudra, at the back door; both facing each other;--thus La _t_ y. IV, 3,\naccording to which authority, however, they are merely to say respectively,\n'These Sattrins have not succeeded!'--'They have succeeded!'] At the same time\na harlot and a theological student (brahma _kh_ arin) upbraid one another (in\nfront of the \xc3\x82gnidhriya fire shed); while (south of the Mar _g_ aliya) a sham\ncontest takes place between an \xc3\x82rya (Vai _s_ ya) and a _S_ udra for the\npossession of a round white skin, the _S_ udra having to give in (after the\nthird effort, when the \xc3\x82rya beats him with the skin). Thereupon a couple is\nshut up in an enclosed space south of the Mar _g_ aliya (or behind the\n\xc3\x82gnidhriya, La _t_ y.) for maithuna.\n\n[431:1](sbe2673.htm#fr_1002) Or, the thought-swift (mano _g_ u).\n\n[431:2](sbe2673.htm#fr_1003) For the different meanings of 'va _g_ a' see Max\nMuller, 'India, what can it teach us?' p. 164.\n\n[431:3](sbe2673.htm#fr_1004) Or, in all our invocations (havana).\n\n[431:4](sbe2673.htm#fr_1005) The identification of Vi _s_ vakarman with Indra\nwas probably suggested by the final pada of the preceding verse of the hymn\n(Rig-veda X, 81, 6): 'May there be (or may he, Vi _s_ vakarman, be) for us a\nSuri Maghavan' (a rich patron; terms frequently applied to Indra). But cp.\nMuir, O. S. T. vol. iv, p. 7.\n\n[431:5](sbe2673.htm#fr_1006) The Ka _n_ va text does not give the verse, but\nremarks merely,--But if he can get (vindet) an aindri vai _s_ vakarma _n_ i\n(verse), let him draw it therewith.\n\n[432:1](sbe2673.htm#fr_1007) I see no other way of rendering 'yatha-asat' in\nthis passage.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 6, 5.
