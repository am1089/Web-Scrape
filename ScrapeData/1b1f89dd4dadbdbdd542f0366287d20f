The Kundalini feeds the baby in the mother\'s womb. She fulfills our\nevery desire. She is the All in All.\n\n"I praise Tripura which is the treasure house of the race.\n\n"The Kundalini, has three angles as well as three circles, and her Bhupura is\nthree-lined. Her Mantra is three syllables, and she has three aspects. The\nKundalini energy is also threefold in order that she may create the three Gods\n(Brahma, the Creator, or air; Vishnu, the Preserver, or water: Rudra, the\nDestroyer, or fire). Since she is triple everywhere, she is Tripura."\n\n"O Mother of the Universe, those who praise you by the words, Mother, All in\nAll, and Maya, will obtain all.\n\n"There is nothing which can not be obtained on earth or in the Heavens, by Thy\nGrace."\n\nThis is as it should be, as the Kundalini is Power of Powers, Light of Lights,\nand All in All.\n\np. 22\n\nThe Kundalini is Divine static and dynamic energy. The static energy\n(Kundalini), is sleeping at the Muladhara (Root Chakra); the dynamic energy of\nthe Kundalini is all over the body as Prana, Apana, Samana, Vyana, and Udana.\nThese five Vital breaths, or life forces, keep the body together. The duties\nof the five Pranas are as follows: Prana remains in the upper part of the\nbody, and always moves upward; the Apana resides in the lower part of the\nbody, or abdomen, and always flows downward; the Samana stays in the first\nsection of the torso, digesting and distributing the food substances; the\nVyana resides in the heart, and from there moves all over the body, its duty\nbeing the circulation of the blood; the Udana carries the Soul upward when the\nbody dies.\n\nThese five Pranas stay in the grosser body. They are also in the finer or\nsubtle body--the five finer breaths corresponding to the five grosser Pranas\nabove described.\n\nThe Pranayama Yoga, the Mudra Yoga, and Dharana Yoga, are all for the control\nof the five Pranas and mind. Mind without Prana is like a bird without wings.\nThe practice of the Mudras is to control the dynamic energy of the Kundalini,\nnamely, Prana,\n\np. 23\n\nApana, etc. The practice of Pranayama\n\nis also to control the Prana, Apana, etc.--the dynamic energy of the\nKundalini, and with it awaken the static energy of the Kundalini, which is\nsleeping at the Muladhara, or\n\nroot Chakra. When the five Pranas are controlled or made to stop at the\ndesired place, the Muladhara Chakra, or at the door of the Sushumana, it will\nwork like a spark to the static energy of the Kundalini.\n\n"When Prana and Apana are mixed, it will naturally cause heat in the body;\nthen the body becomes light and powerful. This extreme heat when felt by the\nKundalini, causes her to awaken from sleep. Then she goes into the Sushumana."\n(From H. Y. P.)\n\nThe duty of the Yogin is to gather together or control the five Pranas--the\nlife force of the Kundalini--that the dynamic energy of the Kundalini may be\nused to awaken the static energy of it, as one Kundalini energy will move the\nother energy.\n\n\n\nWhen the Kundalini awakens or moves, what then remains? What will become of\nthe Kundalini? She will go to the Six Chakras and also remain at her place. As\nsteam is converted from water by heat and again returns to it, so rises the\ndynamic energy of\n\np. 24\n\nthe Kundalini, which goes up to the different Chakras and returns again and\nagain.. While she will reach to the Sahasrara, still she will be at her home\nat the Muladhara Chakra.\n\nThe Kundalini power can only be known by Master Yogins, but some times even\nordinary Yogins can see it, however not as clearly, as long as the inner eye\nis not open. When the Yogin has opened the inner eye, then he sees the\ndifferent Chakras and the energy of the Kundalini, which is Life of Life, and\nLight of Lights.\n\nThe following Masterly and Scientific explanation of the Kundalini is by Prof.\nP. Mukhyopadhyaya, and was written for Arthur Avalon and brought out in his\nbook.\n\n"The Serpent Power," pp. 302-313.\n\nI here acknowledge my thanks for the use of this explanation, and I wish that\nevery student of Yoga would read "The Serpent Power." R. S. Gherwal.\n\n\n\n"When you say that Kundali Shakti is the primordial Shakti at rest, I am led\nto think of an analogy (and it may be more than an analogy) in modern science.\nCosmic energy in its physical aspect may be considered either as static or as\ndynamic, the former being\n\np. 25\n\na condition of equilibrium, the latter a condition of motion or change of\nrelative position. Thus a material thing apparently at rest (there being no\nabsolute rest except in pure Consciousness or Chit) should be regarded as\nenergy or Shakti equilibrated, the. various elements of it holding one another\nin check (or, as the mathematicians will say, the algebraic sum of the forces\nbeing zero). Of course, in any given case the equilibrium is relative rather\nthan absolute. The important thing to note is this polarisation of Shakti into\ntwo forms--static and dynamic.\n\n"In the tissues of a living body, again, the operative energy (whatever the\nnature of that may be, whether we believe in a special \'vital force\' or not)\npolarises itself into two similar forms--anabolic and katabolic--one tending\nto change and the other to conserve the tissues, the actual condition of the\ntissues being simply the resultant of these two coexistent or concurrent\nactivities.\n\n"In the mind or experience also this polarisation or polarity is patent to\nreflection. In my own writings * I have constantly urged:\n\np. 26\n\nthis polarity between pure Chit and the stress which is involved in it: there\nis a stress or Shakti developing the mind through an infinity of forms and\nchanges; but all these forms and changes are known as involved in the pure and\nunbounded ether of awareness (Chidakasha). This analysis therefore exhibits\nthe primordial Shakti in the same two polar forms as before--static and\ndynamic--and here the polarity is most fundamental and approaches\nabsoluteness.\n\n"Lastly, let us consider for one moment the atom of modern science. The\nchemical atom has ceased to be an atom (indivisible unit of matter). We have\ninstead the electron theory. According to this, the so-called atom is a\nminiature universe very much like our own solar system. At the centre of this\natomic system we have a charge of positive electricity round which a cloud of\nnegative .charges (called electrons) is supposed to revolve, just as myriads\nof planets and smaller bodies revolve round the sun. The positive and the\nnegative charges hold each other in check, so that the atom is a condition of\nequilibrated energy, and does not therefore ordinarily break up, though it may\npossibly break up and set\n\np. 27\n\nfree its equilibrated store of energy, as probably it does in the emanations\nof the radium. What do we notice here? The same polarity of Shakti into a\nstatic and a dynamic partner--viz., the positive charge at rest at the centre,\nand the negative charges in motion round about the centre; a. most suggestive\nanalogy or illustration, perhaps, of the cosmic fact. The illustration may be\ncarried into other domains of science. and philosophy, but I may as well\nforbear going into details. For the present we may,. I think, draw this\nimportant conclusion:\n\n"Shakti, as manifesting itself in the universe, divides itself into two polar\naspects--static and dynamic--which implies that you cannot have it in a\ndynamic form without at the same time having it in a corresponding static\nform, much like the poles of a magnet. In any given sphere of activity of\nforce we must have, according to this cosmic principle, a static background--\nShakti at rest or \'coiled\', as the Tantras say.\n\n"Before I proceed, let me point out what I conceive to be the fundamental\nsignificance of our Tantric and Pauranic Kali. This. figure or Murti is both\nreal and symbolic, as indeed every Murti in the so-called Hindu\n\np. 28\n\nmythology is. Now, the Divine Mother Kali is a symbol of the cosmic truth just\nexplained. Sadashiva, on whose breast She dances, nude and dark, is the static\nbackground of pure Chit, white and inert (Shavarupa), because pure Chit is in\nitself Svaprakasha (self manifest) and Nishkriya (actionless). At the same\ntime, apart from and beyond Consciousness there can be nothing--no power or\n[Shakti](errata.htm#4)--hence the Divine Mother stands on the bosom of the\nDivine Father. The Mother Herself is all activity and Gunamayi (in Her aspect\nas Prakriti composed of the Gunas). Her nakedness means that, though She\nencompasses all, there is nothing to encompass Herself; her darkness means\nthat She is inscrutable, Avang-manasagochara (beyond the reach of thought and\nspeech). Of course, this is no partition of reality into two (there lies the\nimperfection of the Sangkhya doctrine of Purusha and Prakriti, which is\notherwise right), but merely polarisation in our experience of an indivisible\nfact which is the primordial (Adya) Shakti itself. Thus Chit is also Shakti.\nShiva is Shakti and Shakti is Shiva, as the Tantras say. It is Gunashraya\n(support of Gunas) as\n\np. 29\n\nwell as Gunamaya (whose substance is Gunas); Nirguna (attributeless) as well\nas Saguna (with attribute), as said in a well-known passage of the Chandi.\n\n"Your suggestive hint 2 makes the nature of the Kundali Shakti rather clear to\nme. You are quite right, perhaps, in saying that the cosmic Shakti is the\nSamashti (collectivity) in relation to which the Kundali in the bodies is only\nthe Vyashti (individual): it is an illustration, a reproduction on a miniature\nscale, a microcosmic plan, of the whole. The law or principle of the whole--\nthat of macrocosmic Shakti--should therefore be found in the Kundali. That law\nwe have seen to be the law of polarisation into static-dynamic or potential-\nkinetic aspects. In the living body, therefore, there must be such\npolarisation. Now, the Kundali coiled three times and a half at the Muladhara\nis the indispensable and unfailing static background of the dynamic Shakti\noperative in the whole body, carrying on processes and working out changes.\nThe body, therefore, may be compared to a magnet with two poles. The Muladhara\nis the static pole in relation to the rest of the body, which is dynamic;\n\np. 30\n\nthe working the body necessarily presupposes and finds such a static support,\nhence perhaps 3 the name Muladhara, the fundamental support. In one sense, the\nstatic Shakti at the Muladhara is necessarily coexistent with the creating and\nevolving Shakti of the body, because the dynamic aspect or pole can never be\nwithout its static counterpart. In another sense, it is the Shakti **_left\nover_** (you have yourself pointed this out, and the italics are yours), after\nthe Prithivi--the last of the Bhutas--has been created, a magazine of power to\nbe drawn upon and utilized for further activity, if there should arise any\nneed for such. Taking the two senses together (yours as well as mine), Shakti\nat the Muladhara is both coexistent with every act of creation or\nmanifestation and is the residual effect of such act--both cause and effect,\nin fact--an idea which, deeply looked into, shows no real contradiction. There\nis, in fact, what the physicist will describe as a cycle or circuit in action.\nLet us take the impregnated ovum--the earliest embryological stage of the\nliving body. In it the Kundali\n\np. 31\n\n[paragraph continues] Shakti is already presented in its two polar aspects:\nthe ovum, which the mother-element represents, one pole (possibly the static),\nand the [spermatozoon](errata.htm#5), which is the father-element, represents\nthe other (possibly the dynamic). 4 From their fusion proceed those processes\nwhich the biologist calls differentiation and integration; but in all this\nprocess of creation the cycle can be fairly easily traced. Shakti flows out of\nthe germinal cell (fertilised ovum), seizes upon foreign matter, and\nassimilates it and thereby grows in bulk; divides and subdivides itself, and\nthen again co-ordinates all its divided parts into one organic whole. Now in\nall this we have the cycle. Seizing upon foreign matter is an outwardly\ndirected activity, assimilation is an inwardly directed activity or return\ncurrent; cell division and multiplication is an outwardly directed operation,\nco-ordination is inwardly directed; 5 and so on. The force in the germ-cell is\noverflowing, but also continuously it is flowing back into itself, the two\noperations presupposing and sustaining each other, as in every circuit.\n\np. 32\n\n[paragraph continues] The given stock of force in the germ-cell, which is\nstatic so long as the fusion of the male and female elements does not take\nplace in the womb, is the necessary starting-point of all creative activity;\nit is the primordial cause, therefore, in relation to the body--primordial as\nwell as constantly given, unceasing. On the other hand, the reaction of every\ncreative action, the return current or flowing back of every unfolding over\nflow, constantly renews this starting force, changes it without changing its\ngeneral condition of relative equilibrium (and this is quite possible, as in\nthe case of any material system); the force in the germ-cell may therefore be\nalso regarded as a perpetual effect, something left over and set against the\nworking forces of the body. Many apparently inconsistent ideas enter into this\nconception, and they have to be reconciled.\n\n"1. We start with a force in the germ-cell which is statical at first (though,\nlike a dicotyledon seed, or even a modern atom, it involves within itself both\na statical and a dynamical pole; otherwise, from pure rest, involving no\npossibility of motion, no [motion](errata.htm#6) could ever arise). Let this\nbe the Kundali coiled.\n\np. 33\n\n"2. Then there is creative impulse arising out of it; this is motion out of\nrest. By this, the Kundali becomes partly static and partly dynamic, or\nejects, so to say, a dynamic pole out of it in order to evolve the body, but\nremaining a static pole or background itself all along. In no part of the\nprocess has the Kundali really uncoiled itself altogether, or even curtailed\nits three coils and a half. Without this Muladhara Shakti remaining intact no\nevolution could be possible at all. It is the hinge upon which everything else\nturns.\n\n"3. Each creative act again reacts on the Muladhara Shakti, so that such\nreaction, without disturbing the relative rest of the coiled Shakti, changes\nits volume or intensity, but does not curtail or add to the number of coils.\nFor instance, every natural act of respiration reacts on the coiled Shakti at\nthe Muladhara, but it does not commonly make much difference. But Pranayama\npowerfully reacts on it, so much so that it awakes the dormant power and sends\nit piercing through the centres. Now, the common description that the Kundali\nuncoils Herself then and goes up the Sushumna, leaving the Muladhara, should,\nI think,\n\np. 34\n\nbe admitted with caution. That static background can never be absolutely\ndispensed with. As you have yourself rightly observed, \'Shakti can never be\ndepleted, but this is how to look at it\'. Precisely; the Kundali, when\npowerfully worked upon by Yoga, sends forth an emanation or ejection in the\nlikeness of Her own self (like the \'ethereal double\' of the Theosophists and\nSpiritualists) which pierces through the various centres until it becomes\nblended, as you point out, with the Mahakundali of Shiva at the highest or\nseventh centre. Thus, while this \'ethereal double\' or, self-ejection of the\ncoiled power at the Muladhara ascends the Sushumna, the coiled power itself\ndoes not and need not stir from its place. It is like a spark given from an\nover saturated 6 electro-magnetic machine; or, rather, it is like the\nemanations of radium which do not sensibly detract from the energy contained\nin it. This last, perhaps, is the closest physical parallel of the case that\nwe are trying to understand. As a well-known passage in the Upanishad has it,\n\'The whole (Purna) is subtracted from the whole, and yet the whole remains.\' I\nthink our present case\n\np. 35\n\ncomes very near to this. The Kundali at the Muladhara is the whole primordial\nShakti in monad or germ or latency: that is why it is coiled. The Kundali that\nmounts up the Nadi is also the whole Shakti in a specially dynamic form--an\neject likeness of the Eternal Serpent. The result of the last fusion (there\nare successive fusions in the various centres also) in the Sahasrara is also\nthe whole, or Purna. This is how I look at it. In this conception the\npermanent static background is not really depleted, much less is it dispensed\nwith.\n\n"4. When again I say that the volume or intensity of the coiled power can be\naffected (though not its configuration and relative equilibrium), I do not\nmean to throw up the principle of conservation of energy in relation to the\nKundali, which is the embodiment of all energy. It is merely the conversion of\nstatic (potential) energy into dynamic (kinetic) energy in part, the sum\nremaining constant. As we have to deal with infinities here, an exact physical\nrendering of this principle is not to be expected. The Yogi therefore simply\n\'awakens\', and never creates Shakti. By the way, the germ-cell which evolves\nthe body does\n\np. 36\n\nnot, according to modern biology, cease to be a germ-cell in any stage of the\ncomplicated process. The original germ-cell splits up into two: one half\ngradually develops itself into the body of a plant or animal--this is the\nsomatic cell; the other half remains encased within the body practically\nunchanged, and is transmitted in the process of reproduction to the offspring\n--that is, the germ-plasm. Now, this germ-plasm is unbroken through the whole\nline of propagation. This is Weismann\'s doctrine of \'continuity of the germ-\nplasm,\' which has been widely accepted, though it is but an hypothesis."\n\nIn a subsequent postscript the Professor wrote:\n\n"1. Shakti being either static or dynamic, every dynamic form necessarily\npresupposes a static background. A purely dynamic activity (which is motion in\nits physical aspect) is impossible without a static support or ground\n(Adhara). Hence the philosophical doctrine of absolute motion or change, as\ntaught by old Heraclitus and the Buddhists and by modern Bergson, is wrong; it\nis based neither upon correct logic nor upon clear intuition. The constitution\nof an atom reveals the static-dynamic polarisation of Shakti;\n\np. 37\n\nother and more complex forms of existence also do the same. In the living body\nthis necessary static background is Muladhara, where Shakti is Kundali coiled.\nAll the functional activity of the body, starting from the development of the\ngerm-cell, is correlated to, and sustained by the Shakti concentrated at, the\nMuladhara. Cosmic creation, too, ending with the evolution of Prithivi Tattva\n(it is, however, an unending process in a different sense, and there perhaps\nHenry Bergson, who claims that the creative impulse is ever original and\nresourceful, is right), also presupposes a cosmic static background (over and\nabove Chidakasha-ether of Consciousness), which is the Mahakundali Shakti in\nthe Chinmayadeha (body of Consciousness) of Parameshvara or Parameshvari (the\nSupreme Lord in male an female aspect). In the earliest stage of creation,.\nwhen the world arises only as a mist in Divine Consciousness, it requires, as\nthe principle or pole of Tat (That), the correlate principle or pole of Aham\n(I); in the development of the former, the latter serves as the static\nbackground. In our own experiences, too, \'Apperception\' or consciousness of\nself is the sustaining background--a string,\n\np. 38\n\nso to say, which holds together all the loose beads of our elements of\nfeeling. The sustaining ground or Adhara, as the seat of static force,\ntherefore is found, in one form or other, in every phase and stage of creative\nevolution. The absolute or ultimate form is, of course, Chit-Shakti\n(Consciousness as power) itself, the unfailing light of awareness about which\nour Gayatri (Mantra) says: \'Which sustains and impels all the activities of\nBuddhi.\' This fact is symbolised by the Kali-murti: not a mere symbol,\nhowever.\n\n"2. My remarks about the rising or awakening of the Serpent Power at the\nMuladhara have been, perhaps, almost of the nature of a paradox. The coiled\npower, though awakened, uncoiled, and rising, never really stirs from its\nplace; only a sort of \'ethereal double\' or \'eject\' is unloosed and sent up\nthrough the system of centers. Now, in plain language, this ethereal double or\neject means the dynamic equivalent of the static power concentrated at the\nMula, or root. Whenever, by Pranayama of Bijamantra, or any other suitable\nmeans, the Muladhara becomes, like an electro-magnetic machine, oversaturated\n(though the Kundali\n\np. 39\n\n[paragraph continues] Shakti at the Mula is infinite and exhaustless, yet the\ncapacity of a given finite organism to contain it in a static form is limited,\nand therefore there may be oversaturation), a dynamic or operative equivalent\nof the static power is set up, possibly by a law similar to Nature\'s law of\ninduction, by which the static power itself is not depleted or rendered other\nthan static. It is not that static energy at the Mula wholly passes over into\na dynamic form--the coiled Kundali leaving the Mula, thus making it a void;\nthat cannot be, and, were it so, all dynamic operation in the body would cease\ndirectly for want of a background. The coiled power remains coiled or static,\nand yet something apparently passes out of the Mula--viz., the dynamic\nequivalent. This paradox can perhaps be explained in two ways:\n\n"(a) One explanation was suggested in my main letter. The potential Kundali\nShakti becomes partly converted into kinetic Shakti, and yet, since Shakti,\neven as given in the Mula-center, is an infinitude, it is not depleted; the\npotential store always remains unexhausted. I referred to a passage in the\nUpanishad about Purna. In\n\np. 40\n\nthis case the dynamic equivalent is a partial conversion of one mode of energy\ninto another. In Laya-Yoga (here described) it is ordinarily so. When,\nhowever, the infinite potential becomes an infinite kinetic--when, that is to\nsay, the coiled power at the Mula becomes absolutely uncoiled--we have\nnecessarily the dissolution of the three bodies (Sthula, Linga, and Karana--\ngross, subtle, and causal), and consequently Videhamukti (bodiless\nliberation), because the static background in relation to a particular form of\nexistence has now wholly given way, according to our hypothesis. But\nMahakundali remains; hence individual Mukti (liberation) need not mean\ndissolution of Samsara (transmigrating worlds) itself. Commonly, however, as\nthe Tantra says, \'Pitva pitva punah pitva,\' etc. 7\n\n"(b) The other explanation is suggested by the law of induction. Take an\nelectromagnetic machine: \'if a suitable substance be placed near it, will\ninduce in it an equivalent and opposite kind of electro-magnetism 8\n\np. 41\n\nwithout loosing its own stock of energy. In conduction, energy flows over into\nanother thing, so that the source loses and the other thing gains what it has\nlost, and its gain is similar in kind to the loss. Not so induction. There the\nsource does not lose, and the induced energy is equivalent and opposite in\nkind to the inducing energy. Thus a positive charge will induce an equivalent\nnegative charge in a neighbouring object. Now, shall we suppose that the\nMuladhara, when it becomes over-saturated, induces in the neighbouring centre\n(say, Svadhishthana) a dynamic (not static) equivalent? 9 Is this what the\nrise of the Serpent Power really means? The explanation, I am tempted to\nthink, is not perhaps altogether fantastic."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[25:*](kmu06.htm#fr_0) "Approaches to Truth", "The Patent Wonder", valuable\npresentments in modern terms of the ancient Vedantic teaching.\n\n[29:2](kmu06.htm#fr_1) That Kundalini in the static Shakti.\n\n[30:3](kmu06.htm#fr_2) Certainly.\n\n[31:4](kmu06.htm#fr_3) The process of fertilisation is dealt with in the\nMatrikabheda Tantra.\n\n[31:5](kmu06.htm#fr_4) This outflow and inflow is a common Tantrik notion.\n\n[34:6](kmu06.htm#fr_5).
