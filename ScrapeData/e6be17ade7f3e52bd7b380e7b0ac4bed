And (they are) minute.\n\nThe author of the Sutras adds another characteristic quality of the pra _n_\nas. The pra _n_ as under discussion must be viewed as minute. By their\nminuteness we have to understand subtilty and limited size; but not atomic\nsize, as otherwise they would be incapable of producing effects which extend\nover the whole body. They must be subtle; for if they were big the persons\nsurrounding a dying man would see them coming out from the body at the moment\nof death, as a snake comes out of its hole. They must be limited; for if they\nwere all-pervading the scriptural statements as to their passing out of the\nbody, going and coming, would be contradicted thereby, and it could not be\nestablished that the individual soul is 'the essence of the qualities of that'\n(i.e. the manas; cp. II, 3, 29). Should it be said that they may be all-\npervading, but at the same time appear as functions (v _ri_ tti) in the body\nonly, we rejoin that only a function can constitute an instrument. Whatever\neffects perception, may it be a function or something else, just that is an\ninstrument for us. The disagreement is therefore about a name only, and the\nassumption of the instruments (pra _n_ as) being all-pervading is thus\npurposeless.--Hence we decide that the pra _n_ as are subtle and of limited\nsize.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 4, 8](sbe38062.htm)\n\n"
