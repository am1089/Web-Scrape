The story has a natural place there, for Bharata, Shakuntala\'s\nson, is the eponymous ancestor of the princes who play the leading part in the\nepic.\n\nWith no little abbreviation of its epic breadth, the story runs as follows:--\n\nTHE EPIC TALE\n\nOnce that strong-armed king, with a mighty host of men and chariots, entered a\nthick wood. Then when the king had slain thousands of wild creatures, he\nentered another wood with his troops and his chariots, intent on pursuing a\ndeer. And the king beheld a wonderful, beautiful hermit-age on the bank of the\nsacred river Malini; on its bank was the beautiful hermitage of blessed, high-\nsouled Kanva, whither the great sages resorted. Then the king determined to\nenter, that he might see the great sage Kanva, rich in holiness. He laid aside\nthe insignia of royalty and went on alone, but did not see the austere sage in\nthe hermitage. Then, when he did not see the sage, and perceived that the\nhermitage was deserted, he cried aloud, "Who is here?" until the forest seemed\nto shriek. Hearing his cry, a maiden, lovely as Shri, came from the hermitage,\nwearing a hermit garb. "Welcome!" she said at once, greeting him, and\nsmilingly added: "What may be done for you?" Then the king said to the sweet-\nvoiced maid: "I have come to pay reverence to the holy sage Kanva. Where has\nthe blessed one gone, sweet girl? Tell me this, lovely maid."\n\nShakuntala said: "My blessed father has gone from the hermitage to gather\nfruits. Wait a moment. You shall see him when he returns."\n\nThe king did not see the sage, but when the lovely girl of the fair hips and\ncharming smile spoke to him, he saw that\n\np. 98\n\nshe was radiant in her beauty, yes, in her hard vows and self-restraint all\nyouth and beauty, and he said to her:\n\n"Who are you? Whose are you, lovely maiden? Why did you come to the forest?\nWhence are you, sweet girl, so lovely and so good? Your beauty stole my heart\nat the first glance. I wish to know you better. Answer me, sweet maid."\n\nThe maiden laughed when thus questioned by the king in the hermitage, and the\nwords she spoke were very sweet: "O Dushyanta, I am known as blessed Kanva\'s\ndaughter, and he is austere, steadfast, wise, and of a lofty soul."\n\nDushyanta said: "But he is chaste, glorious maid, holy, honoured by the world.\nThough virtue should swerve from its course, he would not swerve from the\nhardness of his vow. How were you born his daughter, for you are beautiful? I\nam in great perplexity about this. Pray remove it."\n\n[Shakuntala here explains how she is the child of a sage and a nymph, deserted\nat birth, cared for by birds ( _shakuntas_ ), found and reared by Kanva, who\ngave her the name Shakuntala.]\n\nDushyanta said: "You are clearly a king\'s daughter, sweet maiden, as you say.\nBecome my lovely wife. Tell me, what shall I do for you? Let all my kingdom be\nyours to-day. Become my wife, sweet maid."\n\nShakuntala said: "Promise me truly what I say to you in secret. The son that\nis born to me must be your heir. If you promise, Dushyanta, I will marry you."\n\n"So be it," said the king without thinking, and added: "I will bring you too\nto my city, sweet-smiling girl."\n\nSo the king took the faultlessly graceful maiden by the hand and dwelt with\nher. And when he had bidden her be of good courage, he went forth, saying\nagain and again: "I will send a complete army for you, and tell them to bring\nmy sweet-smiling bride to my palace." When he had made this promise, the king\nwent thoughtfully to find Kanva. "What will he do when he hears it, this holy,\naustere man?" he wondered, and still thinking, he went back to his capital.\n\nNow the moment he was gone, Kanva came to the hermit-age. And Shakuntala was\nashamed and did not come to meet her father. But blessed, austere Kanva had\ndivine discernment. He discovered her, and seeing the matter\n\np. 99\n\nwith celestial vision, he was pleased and said: "What you have done, dear, to-\nday, forgetting me and meeting a man, this does not break the law. A man who\nloves may marry secretly the woman who loves him without a ceremony; and\nDushyanta is virtuous and noble, the best of men. Since you have found a\nloving husband, Shakuntala, a noble son shall be born to you, mighty in the\nworld."\n\nSweet Shakuntala gave birth to a boy of unmeasured prowess. His hands were\nmarked with the wheel, and he quickly grew to be a glorious boy. As a six\nyears\' child in Kanva\'s hermitage he rode on the backs of lions, tigers, and\nboars near the hermitage, and tamed them, and ran about playing with them.\nThen those who lived in Kanva\'s hermitage gave him a name. "Let him be called\nAll-tamer," they said: "for he tames everything."\n\nBut when the sage saw the boy and his more than human deeds, he said to\nShakuntala: "It is time for him to be anointed crown prince." When he saw how\nstrong the boy was, Kanva said to his pupils: "Quickly bring my Shakuntala and\nher son from my house to her husband\'s palace. A long abiding with their\nrelatives is not proper for married women. It destroys their reputation, and\ntheir character, and their virtue; so take her without delay." "We will," said\nall the mighty men, and they set out with Shakuntala and her son for\nGajasahvaya.\n\nWhen Shakuntala drew near, she was recognised and invited to enter, and she\nsaid to the king: "This is your son, O King. You must anoint him crown prince,\njust as you promised before, when we met."\n\nWhen the king heard her, although he remembered her, he said: "I do not\nremember. To whom do you belong, you wicked hermit-woman? I do not remember a\nunion with you for virtue, love, and wealth. 1 Either go or stay, or do\nwhatever you wish."\n\nWhen he said this, the sweet hermit-girl half fainted from shame and grief,\nand stood stiff as a pillar. Her eyes darkened with passionate indignation;\nher lips quivered; she seemed to consume the king as she gazed at him with\nsidelong glances. Concealing her feelings and nerved by anger, she held in\ncheck the magic power that her ascetic\n\np. 100\n\nlife had given her. She seemed to meditate a moment, overcome by grief and\nanger. She gazed at her husband, then spoke passionately: "O shameless king,\nalthough you know, why do you say, \'I do not know,\' like any other ordinary\nman?"\n\nDushyanta said: "I do not know the son born of you, Shakuntala. Women are\nliars. Who will believe what you say? Are you not ashamed to say these\nincredible things, especially in my presence? You wicked hermit-woman, go!"\n\nShakuntala said: "O King, sacred is holy God, and sacred is a holy promise. Do\nnot break your promise, O King. Let your love be sacred. If you cling to a\nlie, and will not believe, alas! I must go away; there is no union with a man\nlike you. For even without you, Dushyanta, my son shall rule this foursquare\nearth adorned with kingly mountains."\n\nWhen she had said so much to the king, Shakuntala started to go. But a\nbodiless voice from heaven said to Dushyanta: "Care for your son, Dushyanta.\nDo not despise Shakuntala. You are the boy\'s father. Shakuntala tells the\ntruth."\n\nWhen he heard the utterance of the gods, the king joyfully said to his\nchaplain and his ministers: "Hear the words of this heavenly messenger. If I\nhad received my son simply because of her words, he would be suspected by the\nworld, he would not be pure."\n\nThen the king received his son gladly and joyfully. He kissed his head and\nembraced him lovingly. His wife also Dushyanta honoured, as justice required.\nAnd the king soothed her, and said: "This union which I had with you was\nhidden from the world. Therefore I hesitated, O Queen, in order to save your\nreputation. And as for the cruel words you said to me in an excess of passion,\nthese I pardon you, my beautiful, great-eyed darling, because you love me."\n\nThen King Dushyanta gave the name Bharata to Shakuntala\'s son, and had him\nanointed crown prince.\n\n\n\nIt is plain that this story contains the material for a good play; the very\nform of the epic tale is largely dramatic. It is also plain, in a large way,\nof what nature are the principal changes which a dramatist must introduce in\nthe original. For while Shakuntala is charming in the epic story, the king\n\np. 101\n\nis decidedly contemptible. Somehow or other, his face must be saved.\n\nTo effect this, Kalidasa has changed the old story in three important\nrespects. In the first place, he introduces the curse of Durvasas, clouding\nthe king\'s memory, and saving him from moral responsibility in his rejection\nof Shakuntala. That there may be an ultimate recovery of memory, the curse is\nso modified as to last only until the king shall see again the ring which he\nhas given to his bride. To the Hindu, curse and modification are matters of\nfrequent occurrence; and Kalidasa has so delicately managed the matter as not\nto shock even a modern and Western reader with a feeling of strong\nimprobability. Even to us it seems a natural part of the divine cloud that\nenvelops the drama, in no way obscuring human passion, but rather giving to\nhuman passion an unwonted largeness and universality.\n\nIn the second place, the poet makes Shakuntala undertake her journey to the\npalace before her son is born. Obviously, the king\'s character is thus made to\nappear in a better light, and a greater probability is given to the whole\nstory.\n\nThe third change is a necessary consequence of the first; for without the\ncurse, there could have been no separation, no ensuing remorse, and no\nreunion.\n\nBut these changes do not of themselves make a drama out of the epic tale.\nLarge additions were also necessary, both of scenes and of characters. We\nfind, indeed, that only acts one and five, with a part of act seven, rest upon\nthe ancient text, while acts two, three, four, and six, with most of seven,\nare a creation of the poet. As might have been anticipated, the acts of the\nformer group are more dramatic, while those of the latter contribute more of\npoetical charm. It is with these that scissors must be chiefly busy when the\nplay--rather too long for continuous presentation as it stands--is performed\non the stage.\n\nIn the epic there are but three characters--Dushyanta, Shakuntala, Kanva, with\nthe small boy running about in the background. To these Kalidasa has added\nfrom the palace, from the hermitage, and from the Elysian region which is\nrepresented with vague precision in the last act.\n\nThe conventional clown plays a much smaller part in this play than in the\nothers which Kalidasa wrote. He has also\n\np. 102\n\nless humour. The real humorous relief is given by the fisher-man and the three\npolicemen in the opening scene of the sixth act. This, it may be remarked, is\nthe only scene of rollicking humour in Kalidasa\'s writing.\n\nThe forest scenes are peopled with quiet hermit-folk. Far the most charming of\nthese are Shakuntala\'s girl friends. The two are beautifully differentiated:\nAnusuya grave, sober; Priyamvada vivacious, saucy; yet wonderfully united in\nfriendship and in devotion to Shakuntala, whom they feel to possess a deeper\nnature than theirs.\n\nKanva, the hermit-father, hardly required any change from the epic Kanva. It\nwas a happy thought to place beside him the staid, motherly Gautami. The small\nboy in the last act has magically become an individual in Kalidasa\'s hands. In\nthis act too are the creatures of a higher world, their majesty not rendered\ntoo precise.\n\nDushyanta has been saved by the poet from his epic shabbiness; it may be\ndoubted whether more has been done. There is in him, as in some other Hindu\nheroes, a shade too much of the meditative to suit our ideal of more alert and\nready manhood.\n\nBut all the other characters sink into insignificance beside the heroine.\nShakuntala dominates the play. She is actually on the stage in five of the\nacts, and her spirit pervades the other two, the second and the sixth.\nShakuntala has held captive the heart of India for fifteen hundred years, and\nwins the love of increasing thousands in the West; for so noble a union of\nsweetness with strength is one of the miracles of art.\n\nThough lovely women walk the world to-day  \n  By tens of thousands, there is none so fair  \nIn all that exhibition and display  \n  With her most perfect beauty to compare--\n\nbecause it is a most perfect beauty of soul no less than of outward form. Her\ncharacter grows under our very eyes. When we first meet her, she is a simple\nmaiden, knowing no greater sorrow than the death of a favourite deer; when we\nbid her farewell, she has passed through happy love, the mother\'s joys and\npains, most cruel humiliation and suspicion, and the reunion with her husband,\nproved at last not to have been unworthy. And each of these great experiences\nhas\n\np. 103\n\nbeen met with a courage and a sweetness to which no words can render justice.\n\nKalidasa has added much to the epic tale; yet his use of the original is\nremarkably minute. A list of the epic suggestions incorporated in his play is\nlong. But it is worth making, in order to show how keen is the eye of genius.\nThus the king lays aside the insignia of royalty upon entering the grove (Act\nI). Shakuntala appears in hermit garb, a dress of bark (Act I). The quaint\nderivation of the heroine\'s name from _shakunta_ \\--bird--is used with\nwonderful skill in a passage (Act VII) which defies translation, as it\ninvolves a play on words. The king\'s anxiety to discover whether the maiden\'s\nfather is of a caste that permits her to marry him is reproduced (Act I). The\nmarriage without a ceremony is retained (Act IV), but robbed of all offence.\nKanva\'s celestial vision, which made it unnecessary for his child to tell him\nof her union with the king, is introduced with great delicacy (Act IV). The\ncurious formation of the boy\'s hand which indicated imperial birth adds to the\nking\'s suspense (Act VII). The boy\'s rough play with wild animals is made\nconvincing (Act VII) and his very nickname All-tamer is preserved (Act VII).\nKanva\'s worldly wisdom as to husband and wife dwelling together is reproduced\n(Act IV). No small part of the give-and-take between the king and Shakuntala\nis given (Act V), but with a new dignity.\n\nOf the construction of the play I speak with diffidence. It seems admirable to\nme, the apparently undue length of some scenes hardly constituting a blemish,\nas it was probably intended to give the actors considerable latitude of choice\nand excision. Several versions of the text have been preserved; it is from the\nlonger of the two more familiar ones that the translation in this volume has\nbeen made. In the warm discussion over this matter, certain technical\narguments of some weight have been advanced in favour of this choice; there is\nalso a more general consideration which seems to me of importance. I find it\nhard to believe that any lesser artist could pad such a masterpiece, and pad\nit all over, without making the fraud apparent on almost every page. The\nbriefer version, on the other hand, might easily grow out of the longer,\neither as an acting text, or as a school-book.\n\np. 104\n\nWe cannot take leave of Shakuntala in any better way than by quoting the\npassage 1 in which Levi\'s imagination has conjured up "the memorable _premi\nere_ when Shakuntala saw the light, in the presence of Vikramaditya and his\ncourt."\n\n\n\nLa fete du printemps approche; Ujjayini, la ville aux riches marchands et la\ncapitale intellectuelle de l\'Inde, glorieuse et prospere sous un roi\nvictorieux et sage, se prepare a celebrer la solennite avec une pompe digne de\nson opulence et de son gout. . . .
