For one and the same (highest divinity), called the 'truly being,' and so\non (is the subject of that meditation).\n\nFor the highest divinity, called there _that which is_ \\--\n\np. 659\n\nwhich was introduced in the clause 'that divinity thought,' &c.--is intimated\nby all the following sections of that chapter. This is proved by the fact that\nthe attributes--' _that which truly is_ ' and so on--which were mentioned in\nthe first section and confirmed in the subsequent ones, are finally summed up\nin the statement, 'in that all this has its Self, that is the True, that is\nthe Self.'\n\nSome interpreters construe the last two Sutras as constituting two adhikara\n_n_ as. The former Sutra, they say, teaches that the text, 'I am thou, thou\nart I,' enjoins a meditation on the soul and the highest Self as\ninterchangeable. But as on the basis of texts such as 'All this is indeed\nBrahman,' 'all this has its Self in Brahman,' 'Thou art that,' the text quoted\nis as a matter of course understood to mean that there is one universal Self,\nthe teaching which it is by those interpreters assumed to convey would be\nnothing new; and their interpretation therefore must be rejected. The point as\nto the oneness of the individual and the highest Self will moreover be\ndiscussed under IV, I, 3. Moreover, there is no foundation for a special\nmeditation on Brahman as the individual soul and the individual soul as\nBrahman, apart from the meditation on the Self of all being one.--The second\nSutra, they say, declares the oneness of the meditation on the True enjoined\nin the text, 'whosoever knows this great wonderful first-born as the True\nBrahman' (B _ri._ Up. V, 4), and of the meditation enjoined in the subsequent\npassage (V, 5. 2), ' Now what is true, that is the \xc3\x82ditya, the person that\ndwells in yonder orb, and the person in the right eye.' But this also is\nuntenable. For the difference of abode mentioned in the latter passage (viz.\nthe abode in the sun and in the eye)establishes difference of vidya, as\nalready shown under Su. III, 3, 21. Nor is it possible to assume that the two\nmeditations comprised in the latter text which have a character of their own\nin so far as they view the True as embodied in syllables, and so on, and which\nare declared to be connected with a special result ('he who knows this\ndestroys evil and leaves it'), should be identical with the one earlier\nmeditation which has an independent\n\np. 660\n\ncharacter of its own and a result of its own ('he conquers these worlds'). Nor\ncan it be said that the declaration of a fruit in 'he destroys evil and leaves\nit' refers merely to the fruit (not of the entire meditation but) of a\nsubordinate part of the meditation; for there is nothing to prove this. The\nproof certainly cannot be said to lie in the fact of the vidyas being one; for\nthis would imply reasoning in a circle, viz. as follows--it being settled that\nthe vidyas are one, it follows that the fruit of the former meditation only is\nthe main one, while the fruits of the two later meditations are subordinate\nones; and--it being settled that those two later fruits are subordinate ones,\nit follows that, as thus there is no difference depending on connexion with\nfruits, the two later meditations are one with the preceding one.--All this\nproves that the two Sutras can be interpreted only in the way maintained by\nus.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'being within.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 38.
