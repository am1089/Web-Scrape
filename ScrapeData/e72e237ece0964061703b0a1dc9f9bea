(There lived once) a king\nnamed Ar _g_ una 4, a descendant of K _ri_ tavirya, possessed of a thousand\narms, who with his bow conquered the (whole) earth up to the ocean. Once\n\np. 294\n\non a time, as we have heard, he was walking about near the sea, proud of his\nstrength, and showering hundreds of arrows on the sea. The ocean, saluting\nhim, and with joined hands, said, 'O brave man! do not throw arrows (on me).\nSay, what shall I do for you? The creatures, who take shelter with me, are\nbeing destroyed, O tiger-like king! by the great arrows thrown by you. Give\nthem security, O Lord!'\n\nAr _g_ una said:\n\nIf there is anywhere any wielder of the bow equal to me in battle, who might\nstand against me in the field, name him to me.\n\nThe ocean said:\n\nIf, O king! you have heard of the great sage _G_ amadagni, his son is (the)\nproper (person) to show you due hospitality 1.\n\nThen the king, full of great wrath, went away, and arriving at that hermitage\napproached Rama only. In company with his kinsmen, he did many (acts)\ndisagreeable to Rama, and caused much trouble to the high-souled Rama. Then\nthe power of Rama, whose power was unbounded, blazed forth, burning the hosts\nof the enemy, O lotus-eyed one! And then Rama, taking up his axe, hacked away\nthat man of the thousand arms in battle, like a tree of many branches. Seeing\nhim killed and fallen, all (his) kinsmen assembled together, and taking swords\nand lances, surrounded the descendant of Bh _ri_ gu. Rama also taking up a\nbow, and hurriedly mounting a chariot, shot away volleys of arrows, and blew\naway the army of the king. Then some of the\n\np. 295\n\n[paragraph continues] Kshatriyas, often troubled by fear of the son of _G_\namadagni, entered mountains and inaccessible places, like antelopes troubled\nby a lion. And the subjects of those (Kshatriyas) who were not performing\ntheir prescribed duties 1 through fear of him, became V _ri_ shalas, owing to\nthe disappearance of Brahma _n_ as 2. Thus the Dravi _d_ as, \xc3\x82bhiras, Pau _nd_\nras, together with the _S_ abaras, became V _ri_ shalas 3, owing to the\nabandonment of their duties by Kshatriyas. Then when the heroic (children) of\nKshatriya women were destroyed again and again, the Kshatriyas, who were\nproduced by the Brahma _n_ as 4, were also destroyed by the son of _G_\namadagni. At the end of the twenty-first slaughter, a bodiless voice from\nheaven, which was heard by all people, spoke sweetly to Rama, 'O Rama! O Rama!\ndesist (from this slaughter). What good, dear friend, do you perceive, in\ntaking away the lives of these kinsmen of Kshatriyas over and over again?'\nThen, too, his grandfathers 5, with _Rik_ ika as their head, likewise said to\nthe high-souled (Rama), 'Desist, O noble one 6!' But Rama, not forgiving his\nfather's\n\np. 296\n\nmurder, said to those sages, 'You ought not to keep me back from this.'\n\nThe Pit _ri_ s said:\n\nO best of victors! you ought not to destroy these kinsmen of Kshatriyas. It is\nnot proper for you, being a Brahma _n_ a, to slaughter these kings.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[293:1](sbe0840.htm#fr_1422) Cf. Taittiriya-upanishad, p. 40.\n\n[293:2](sbe0840.htm#fr_1423) The readings here in the MSS. are not\nsatisfactory. I adopt as the best that which appears to have been before Ar\n_g_ una Mi _s_ ra. The meaning seems to be this:--I have now understood the\ntruth, but I cannot be blamed for having hitherto done that which I saw every\none else do. Now I have had the benefit of conversation with a good man, and\nhave become free from my delusion.\n\n[293:3](sbe0841.htm#fr_1424) Namely, that final emancipation. is not to be\nobtained by action, and that slaughter is sinful.\n\n[293:4](sbe0841.htm#fr_1425) He is also called a Yogin at Raghuva _m_ sa VI,\n38. See Mallinath's commentary there.\n\n[294:1](sbe0841.htm#fr_1426) I. e. by giving him what be desired--a 'foeman\nworthy of his steel' to fight with him.\n\n[295:1](sbe0841.htm#fr_1427) Viz. the protection of their subjects.\n\n[295:2](sbe0841.htm#fr_1428) As the kings failed to protect the people, the\nBrahma _n_ as apparently were nowhere forthcoming.\n\n[295:3](sbe0841.htm#fr_1429) Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, vol. i, pp. 482 seq.,\n358, 391; vol. ii, p. 423; _S_ anti Parvan, ch. 65, st. 13; ch. 207, st. 42\n(Ra _g_ adharma).\n\n[295:4](sbe0841.htm#fr_1430) As Kshatriyas were required for the protection of\nthe people, the Brahma _n_ as procreated them on Kshatriya women. See Muir,\nSanskrit Texts, vol. ii, p. 451 seq. And as they were the offspring of these\nanomalous connexions they are described as 'kinsmen of Kshatriyas.` Cf. _Kh_\nandogya, p. 317; B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p. 1037 and comments there.
