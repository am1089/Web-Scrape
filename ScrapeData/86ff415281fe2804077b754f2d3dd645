He who instigates to, he who assists in, and he who commits (an act, these\nthree) share its rewards in heaven and its punishments in hell.\n\n2\\. He amongst these who contributes most to the accomplishment (of the act\nobtains) a greater share of the result.\n\n3\\. Both the wife and the husband have power over (their) common property. 3\n\n4\\. By their permission, others also may act for their good (in this and the\nnext world, even by spending money). 4\n\n5\\. Men of learning and pure descent, who are aged, clever in reasoning, and\ncareful in fulfilling the duties (of their caste and order, shall be the\njudges) in lawsuits. 5\n\n6\\. In doubtful cases (they shall give their decision) after having\nascertained (the truth) by inference, ordeals, and the like (means). 6b\n\n7\\. A person who is possessed of good qualities (may be called as a witness,\nand) shall answer the questions put to him according to the truth on an\nauspicious day, in the morning, before a kindled fire, standing near (a jar\nfull of) water, in the presence of the king, and with the consent of all (of\nboth parties and of the assessors), after having been exhorted (by the judge)\nto be fair to both sides. 7\n\n8\\. If (he is found out speaking) an untruth, the king shall punish him. 8\n\np. 170\n\n9\\. Besides, in that case, after death, hell (will be his punishment). 9\n\n10\\. If he speaks the truth, (his reward will be) heaven and the approbation\nof all created beings. 10\n\n11\\. The knowledge which _S_ udras and women possess is the completion (of all\nstudy). 11\n\n12\\. They declare, that (this knowledge) is a supplement of the Atharva-Veda.\n\n13\\. It is difficult to learn the sacred law from (the letter of) the Vedas\n(only); but by following the indications it is easily accomplished.\n\n14\\. The indications for these (doubtful cases are), \'He shall regulate his\ncourse of action according to the conduct which is unanimously recognised in\nall countries by men of the three twice-born castes, who have been properly\nobedient (to their teachers), who are aged, of subdued senses, neither given\nto avarice, nor hypocrites. Acting thus he will gain both worlds.\' 14\n\n15\\. Some declare, that the remaining duties (which have not been taught here)\nmust be learnt from women and men of all castes.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[169:3](sbe0264.htm#fr_786) **29**. \'Though this is so, still the wife cannot\nspend (money) without the permission of her husband, but the husband can do\n(so without the consent of his wife). That may be known by Sutra II, 6, 14,\n11, "They do not declare it to be a theft if the wife spends money for a good\nreason during the absence of her husband."\'--Haradatta.\n\n[169:4](sbe0264.htm#fr_787) \'Others, i.e. the sons and the rest.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[169:5](sbe0264.htm#fr_788) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_.

The meaning of the Sutra is, that\nmen ought not to study solely or at first such _S_ astras as women or _S_\nudras also learn, but that at first they must study the Veda. See Manu II,\n168. The knowledge which women and _S_ udras possess is dancing, music, and\nother branches of the Artha _s_ astra.\n\n[170:14](sbe0264.htm#fr_795) See above, I, 7, 20, 8 and 9.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter I](sbe0265.htm)\n\n'
