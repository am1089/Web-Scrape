The hi\xe1\xb9\x85kara is the threefold knowledge, the prastava these three worlds,\nthe udgitha Agni (fire), Vayu (air), and \xc3\x82ditya (sun), the pratihara the\nstars, the birds, and the rays, the nidhana the serpents, Gandharvas, and\nfathers. That is the Saman, as interwoven in everything.\n\n2\\. He who thus knows this Saman, as interwoven in everything, he becomes\neverything.\n\np. 33\n\n3\\. And thus it is said in the following verse: There are the fivefold three\n(the three kinds of sacrificial knowledge, the three worlds &c. in their\nfivefold form, i. e. as identified with the hi\xe1\xb9\x85kara, the prastava, &c.), and\nthe other forms of the Saman. Greater than these there is nothing else\nbesides.'\n\n4\\. He who knows this, knows everything. All regions offer him gifts. His rule\nis, 'Let him meditate (on the Saman), knowing that he is. everything, yea,\nthat he is everything 1.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[33:1](sbe01055.htm#fr_150) Here ends the Samopasana.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 22](sbe01056.htm)\n\n"
