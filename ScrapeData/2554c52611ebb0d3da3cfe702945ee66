XIV.\n\nOf occasional \xc5\x9araddhas, or obsequial ceremonies: when most efficacious, and at\nwhat places.\n\nAURVA proceeded.--"Let the devout performer of an ancestral oblation\npropitiate Brahma, Indra, Rudra, the \xc3\x81\xc5\x9bwins, the sun, fire, the\n\np. 321\n\n[paragraph continues] Vasus, the winds, the Vi\xc5\x9bwadevas, the sages, birds, men,\nanimals, reptiles, progenitors, and all existent things, by offering adoration\nto them\n\np. 322\n\nmonthly, on the fifteenth day of the moon\'s wane (or dark fortnight), or on\nthe eighth day of the same period in certain months, or at particular seasons,\nas I will explain.\n\n"When a householder finds that any circumstance has occurred, or a\ndistinguished guest has arrived, on which account ancestral ceremonies are\nappropriate, the should celebrate them. He should offer a voluntary sacrifice\nupon any atmospheric portent, at the equinoctial and solstitial periods, at\neclipses of the sun and moon, on the sun\'s entrance into a zodiacal sign, upon\nunpropitious aspects of the planets and asterisms, on dreaming unlucky dreams,\nand on eating the grain of the year\'s harvest. The Pitris 1 derive\nsatisfaction for eight years from ancestral offerings upon the day of new moon\nwhen the star of the conjunction 2 is Anuradha, Vi\xc5\x9bakha, or Swati; and for\ntwelve years when it is Pushya, Ardra, or Punarvasu. It is not easy for a man\nto effect his object, who is desirous of worshipping the Pitris or the gods on\na day of new moon when the stars are those of Dhanisht\xcc\x81ha, Purvabhadrapada, or\n\xc5\x9aatabhisha. Hear also an account of another class of Sraddhas, which afford\nespecial contentment to progenitors, as explained by Sanatkumara, the son of\nBrahma, to the magnanimous Pururavas, when full of faith and devotion to the\nPitris he inquired how he might please them. The third lunar day of the month\nVai\xc5\x9bakha (April, May), and the ninth of Kartika\n\np. 323\n\n[paragraph continues] (October, November), in the light fortnight; the\nthirteenth of Nabha (July, August), and the fifteenth of Magha (January,\nFebruary), in the dark fortnight; are called by ancient teachers the\nanniversaries of the first day of a Yuga, or age (Yugadya), and are esteemed\nmost sacred. On these days, water mixed with sesamum-seeds should be regularly\npresented to the progenitors of mankind; as well as on every solar and lunar\neclipse; on the eighth lunations of the dark fortnights of Agrahayan\xcc\x81a, Magha,\nand Phalguna (December--February); on the two days commencing the solstices,\nwhen the nights and days alternately begin to diminish; on those days which\nare the anniversaries of the beginning of the Manwantaras; when the sun is in\nthe path of the goat; and on all occurrences of meteoric phenomena. A \xc5\x9araddha\nat these seasons contents the Pitris for a thousand years: such is the secret\nwhich they have imparted. The fifteenth day of the dark half of the month\nMagha, when united with the conjunction of the asterism over which Varun\xcc\x81a\npresides (Satabhisha), is a season of no little sanctity, when offerings are\nespecially grateful to the progenitors. Food and water presented by men who\nare of respectable families, when the asterism Dhanisht\xcc\x81ha is combined with\nthe day of new moon, content the Pitris for ten thousand years; whilst they\nrepose for a whole age when satisfied by offerings made on the day of new moon\nwhen \xc3\x81rdra is the lunar mansion.\n\n"He who, after having offered food and libations to the Pitris, bathes in the\nGanges, Satlaj, Vipa\xc5\x9ba (Beyah), Saraswati, or the Gomati at Naimisha, expiates\nall his sins. The Pitris also say, \'After having received satisfaction for a\ntwelvemonth, we shall further derive gratification by libations offered by our\ndescendants at some place of pilgrimage, at the end of the dark fortnight of\nMagha.\' The songs of the Pitris confer purity of heart, integrity of wealth,\nprosperous seasons, perfect rites, and devout faith; all that men can desire.\nHear the verses that constitute those songs, by listening to which all those\nadvantages will be secured, oh prince, by you. \'That enlightened individual\nwho begrudges not his wealth, but presents us with cakes, shall be born in a\ndistinguished family. Prosperous and affluent shall that man ever be, who in\nhonour of us gives to the Brahmans, if he is wealthy, jewels, clothes,\n\np. 324\n\nland, conveyances, wealth, or any valuable presents; or who, with faith and\nhumility, entertains them with food, according to his means, at proper\nseasons. If he cannot afford to give them dressed food, he must, in proportion\nto his ability, present them with unboiled grain, or such gifts, however\ntrifling, as he can bestow. Should he be utterly unable even to do this, he\nmust give to some eminent Brahman, bowing at the same time before him,\nsesamum-seeds adhering to the tips of his fingers, and sprinkle water to us,\nfrom the palms of his hands, upon the ground; or he must gather, as he may,\nfodder for a day, and give it to a cow; by which he will, if firm in faith,\nyield us satisfaction. If nothing of this kind is practicable, he must go to a\nforest, and lift up his arms to the sun and other regents of the spheres, and\nsay aloud--I have no money, nor property, nor grain, nor any thing whatever it\nfor an ancestral offering. Bowing therefore to my ancestors, I hope the\nprogenitors will be satisfied with these arms tossed up in the air in\ndevotion.\' These are the words of the Pitris themselves; and he who\nendeavours, with such means as he may possess, to fulfil their wishes,\nperforms the ancestral rite called a \xc5\x9araddha."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[322:1](vp088.htm#fr_878) p. 320 We may here take the opportunity of inquiring\nwho are meant by the Pitris; and, generally speaking, they may be called a\nrace of divine beings, inhabiting celestial regions of their own, and\nreceiving into their society the spirits of those mortals for whom the rite of\nfellowship in obsequial cakes with them, the Sapin\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikaran\xcc\x81a, has been duly\nperformed. The Pitris collectively, therefore, include a man\'s ancestors; but\nthe principal members of this order of beings are of a different origin. The\nVayu, Matsya, and Padma Puran\xcc\x81as, and Hari Van\xc5\x9ba, profess to give an account\nof the original Pitris. The account is much the same, and for the most part in\nthe same words, in all. They agree in distinguishing the Pitris into seven\nclasses; three of which are without form, or composed of intellectual, not\nelementary substance, and assuming what forms they please; and four are\ncorporeal. When they come to the enumeration of the particular classes they\nsomewhat differ, and the accounts in all the works are singularly imperfect.\nAccording to a legend given by the Vayu and the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba, the first Pitris\nwere the sons of the gods. The gods having offended Brahma, by neglecting to\nworship him, were cursed by him to become fools; but upon their repentance he\ndirected them to apply to their sons for instruction. Being taught accordingly\nthe rites of expiation and penance by their sons, they addressed them as\nfathers; whence the sons of the gods were the first Pitris. So the\n[Matsya](errata.htm#14) has \'The Pitris are born in the Manwantaras as the\nsons of the gods.\' The Hari Van\xc5\x9ba makes the sons assume the character of\nfathers, addressing them, \'Depart, children.\' Again; the Vayu P. declares the\nseven orders of Pitris to have been originally the first gods, the Vairajas,\nwhom Brahma, with the eye of Yoga, beheld in the eternal spheres, and who are\nthe gods of the gods. Again; in the same work we have the incorporeal Pitris\ncalled Vairajas, from being the sons of the Prajapati Viraja. The Matsya\nagrees with this latter statement, and adds that the gods worship them. The\nHari Van\xc5\x9ba has the same statement, but more precisely p. 321 distinguishes the\nVairajas as one class only of the incorporeal Pitris. The commentator states\nthe same, calling the three incorporeal Pitris, Vairajas, Agnishwattas, and\nVarhishads; and the four corporeal orders, Sukalas, \xc3\x81ngirasas, Suswadhas, and\nSomapas. The Vairajas are described as the fathers of Mena, the mother of Uma.\nTheir abode is variously termed the Santanika, Sanatana, and Soma loka. As the\nposterity of Viraja, they are the Somasads of Manu. The other classes of\nPitris the three Puran\xcc\x81as agree with Manu in representing as the sons of the\npatriarchs, and in general assign to them the same offices and posterity. They\nare the following:--\n\nAgnishwattas--sons of Marichi, and Pitris of the gods (Manu, Matsya, Padma):\nliving in Soma-loka, and parents of Achchoda (Matsya, Padma, Hari Van\xc5\x9ba). The\nVayu makes them residents of Viraja-loka, sons of Pulastya, Pitris of the\ndemigods and demons, and parents of Pivari; omitting the next order of Pitris,\nto whom these circumstances more accurately refer. The commentator on the Hari\nV. derives the name from Agnishu, \'in or by oblations to fire,\' and \xc3\x81tta,\n\'obtained,\' \'invoked.\'\n\nVarhishads--sons of Atri, and Pitris of the demons (Manu): sons of Pulastya,\nPitris of the demons, residents in Vaibhraja, fathers of Pivari (Matsya,\nPadma, Hari V.).\n\nThese three are the formless or incorporeal Pitris.\n\nSomapas--descendants of Bhrigu, or sons of Kavi by Swadha, the daughter of\nAgni; and Pitris of the Brahmans (Manu and Vayu P.). The Padma calls them\nUshmapas. The Hari V. calls the Somapas, to whom it ascribes the same descent\nas the Vayu, the Pitris of the \xc5\x9audras; and the Sukalas the Pitris of the\nBrahmans.\n\nHavishmantas--in the solar sphere, sons of Angiras, and Pitris of the\nKshatriyas (Manu, Vayu, Matsya, Padma, Hari Van\xc5\x9ba).\n\n\xc3\x81jyapas--sons of Kardama, Pitris of the Vai\xc5\x9byas, in the Kamaduha-loka (Manu,\n&c.); but the lawgiver calls them the sons of Pulastya. The Pitris of the\nVai\xc5\x9byas are called Kavyas in the Nandi Upapuran\xcc\x81a; and in the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba and\nits comment they are termed Suswadhas, sons of Kardama, descended from Pulaha.\n\nSukalins--sons of Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, and Pitris of the \xc5\x9audras (Manu and Vayu P.).\nThey are not mentioned in the Padma. The Matsya inserts the name and descent,\nbut specifies them as amongst the incorporeal Pitris. It may be suspected that\nthe passage is corrupt. The Hari Van\xc5\x9ba makes the Sukalas sons of Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha,\nthe Pitris of the Brahmans; and gives the title of Somapas to the Pitris of\nthe \xc5\x9audras. In general this work follows the Vayu; but with omissions and\ntranspositions, as if it had carelessly mutilated its original.\n\nBesides these Pitris or progenitors, other heavenly beings are sometimes made\nto adopt a similar character: thus Manu says, "The wise call our fathers\nVasus; our paternal grandfathers, Rudras; our paternal great grandfathers,\n\xc3\x81dityas; agreeably p. 322 to a text of the Vedas:" that is, these divine\nbeings are to be meditated upon along with, and as not distinct from,\nprogenitors. Hemadri quotes the Nandi Upapuran\xcc\x81a for a different practice, and\ndirects Vishn\xcc\x81u to be identified with the father, Brahma with the grandfather,\nand \xc5\x9aiva with the great grandfather. This, however, is \xc5\x9aaiva innovation. The\nVaishn\xcc\x81avas direct Aniruddha to be regarded as one\'s-self, and Pradyumna,\nSankarshan\xcc\x81a, and Vasudeva as the three ancestors. Again, they are identified\nwith Varun\xcc\x81a, Prajapatya, and Agni; or, again, with months, seasons, and\nyears. Nirn\xcc\x81aya Sindhu, p. 284. It may be doubted how far any of these\ncorrectly represent the original notions inculcated by the texts of the Vedas,\nfrom which, in the most essential particulars, they are derived.\n\n[322:2](vp088.htm#fr_879) When the Yogatara, or principal star seen, is the\nchief star or stars of these asterisms or lunar mansions respectively, see the\ntable given by Mr. Colebrooke: As. Res. IX. p. 346. The first three named in\nthe text are stars in Scorpio, Libra, and Arcturus: the second three are stars\nin Cancer, Gemini, and Orion: and the third are stars in the Dolphin, Pegasus,\nand Aquarius.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XV](vp089.htm)\n\n'
