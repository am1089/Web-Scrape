But (Brahman is called a bank &c.) on account of (a certain) equality.\n\nThe word 'but' is meant to set aside the previously established conclusion.--\nThere can exist nothing different from Brahman, since we are unable to observe\na proof for such existence. That all existences which have a beginning spring\nfrom, subsist through, and return into Brahman we have already ascertained,\nand have shown that the effect is non-different from the cause.--Nor can there\nexist, apart from Brahman, something which has no beginning, since scripture\naffirms that 'Being only this was\n\np. 177\n\nin the beginning, one, without a second.' The promise moreover that through\nthe cognition of one thing everything will be known, renders it impossible\nthat there should exist anything different from Brahman.--But does not the\nfact that the Self is called a bank, &c. indicate that there exists something\nbeyond the Self?--No, we reply; the passages quoted by the purvapakshin have\nno power to prove his conclusion. For the text only says that the Self is a\nbank, not that there is something beyond it. Nor are we entitled to assume the\nexistence of some such thing, merely to the end of accounting for the Self\nbeing called a bank; for the simple assumption of something unknown is a mere\npiece of arbitrariness. If, moreover, the mere fact of the Self being called a\nbank implied the existence of something beyond it, as in the case of an\nordinary bank, we should also be compelled to conclude that the Self is made\nof earth and stones; which would run counter to the scriptural doctrine that\nthe Self is not something produced.--The proper explanation is that the Self\nis called a bank because it resembles a bank in a certain respect; as a bank\ndams back the water and marks the boundary of contiguous fields, so the Self\nsupports the world and its boundaries. The Self is thus glorified by the name\nof bank because it resembles one.--In the clause quoted above, 'having passed\nthat bank,' the verb 'to pass' cannot be taken in the sense of 'going beyond,'\nbut must rather mean 'to reach fully.' In the same way we say of a student,\n'he has passed the science of grammar,' meaning thereby that he has fully\nmastered it.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[176:1](sbe38134.htm#fr_122) Which would be unnecessary if the two were not\ndistinct.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2, 33](sbe38136.htm)\n\n"
