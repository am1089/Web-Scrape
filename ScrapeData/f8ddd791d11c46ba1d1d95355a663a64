Should it be said that (the text) declares (it); we say, not so; for the\nintelligent Self (is meant), on account of subject-matter.\n\n'He who has meditated on that which is without sound, without touch, without\nform, without decay, without taste, eternal, without smell, without beginning,\nwithout end, beyond the Great, unchangeable; is freed from the jaws of death'\n(Ka. Up. II, 3,15), this scriptural text, closely following on the text under\ndiscussion, represents the 'Unevolved' as the object of knowledge!--Not so, we\nreply. What that _s_ loka represents as the object of meditation is (not the\nUnevolved but) the intelligent Self, i.e. the Supreme Person. For it is the\nlatter who forms the general subject-matter, as we infer from two preceding\npassages, viz. 'He who has knowledge for his charioteer, and who holds the\nreins of the mind, he reaches the end of his journey, the highest place of\nVish _n_ u'; and 'That Self is hidden in all beings and does not shine forth,\nbut it is seen by subtle seers through their sharp and subtle intellect.' For\nthis reason, also, the clause 'Higher than the person there is nothing' cannot\nbe taken as meant to deny the existence of an entity beyond the 'purusha' in\nthe Sa _n_ khya sense. That the highest Self possesses the qualities of being\nwithout sound, &c., we moreover know from other scriptural texts, such as Mu.\nUp. I, 1, 6 'That which is not to be seen, not to be grasped,' &c. And the\nqualification 'beyond the Great, unchangeable' is meant to declare that the\nhighest Self is beyond the individual Self which had been called 'the Great'\nin a previous passage 'beyond the intellect is the Great Self.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 6.
