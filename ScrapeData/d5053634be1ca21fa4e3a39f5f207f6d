They bore names answering to their\nworks: they were called _Vagdouchta_ , _Crodhana_ , _Hinsa_ , _Pisouna_ ,\n_Cavi_ , _Swasrima_ and _Pitrivarttin:_ they were sons of Cosica, and\ndisciples of Gargya. Their father dying, they commenced the prescribed\nceremonies under the direction of their master. By his order they guarded his\nfoster cow, named Capila, who was accompanied by her calf already as large as\nherself. On the way, the sight of this magnificent cow, who supplied all the\nwants of Gargya, tempted them: hunger impelled them, their reason was blinded;\nthey conceived the cruel and mad project of slaying her. Cavi and Swasrima\nendeavored to prevent them from it. What could they against the others? But\nPitrivarttin, that one among them who was always occupied with the _sraddha_ ,\n* having his mind then on the duty the thought of which possessed him, said to\nhis wondering brothers with anger: "Since we have a sacrifice to make to the\nPitris, let this cow be sacrificed by us with devotion, and her death will\nprofit us. Let us honor the Pitris and no reproach can\n\np. 4\n\nbe made to us." "Well," said they all, and the cow was sacrificed in honor of\nthe Pitris. They told their master afterwards: "Your cow has been slain by a\ntiger, but here is her calf." The Brahman, without suspecting evil, took the\ncalf which they delivered to him.\n\nBut they failed in the respect which they owed to their master; and when Time\ncame to take them all together from this world, for having been cruel and\nwicked, for having rendered themselves guilty of impiety toward their\npreceptor, they all seven reappeared in life in the family of a hunter, of the\ncountry of Dasarna. However, as in sacrificing the cow of their master, they\nhad rendered homage to the Pitris, these brothers, filled with force and\nintelligence, preserved in this existence the remembrance of the past: they\nshowed themselves attached to their duties, performing their functions with\nzeal, and abstaining from every act of cupidity and injustice: now holding in\ntheir breath as long a time as endured the recitation of a _mantra_ , * now\nplunging themselves into profound meditations on their destiny. These were the\nnames of these pious hunters: _Nirvera_ , _Nirvriti_ , _Kchanta_ , _Nirmanyou_\n, _Criti_ , _Veghasa_ , and _Matrivarttin_. Thus these same men who had\nformerly loved evil and injustice, were now so changed that they honored their\nmother bent under the weight of age and rejoiced the heart of their father.\nWhen death had taken away their parents, then leaving their bow, they fixed\nthemselves in the forest, where soon after, they themselves also surrendered\ntheir souls.\n\np. 5\n\nAs a recompense for their good conduct they retained still in their following\nlife the remembrance of the past: they were born upon the agreeable mountain\nCalandyara, under the form of stags with high arching horns, by turns\nexperiencing and inspiring fear. Their names were then _Ounmoukha_ ,\n_Nityavitrasta_ , _Stabdacarna_ , _Vilotchana_ , _Pandita_ , _Ghasmara_ and\n_Nadin_. Thus going over in memory their ancient actions, they wandered in the\nwoods, detached from every sentiment, from every affection, submitting with\nresignation to the duties which they had to fulfill, and in their solitude\ndelivering themselves to the exercises of the _Yoga_. * Extenuated by fasting\nand penitence, they died in the course of pious practices, by which the earth\nwas worn bare and one sees yet, O son of Bharata, upon the mountain Calandyara\nthe mark of their feet.\n\nTheir piety caused that they passed into a class of beings more elevated;\ntransported into the beautiful country of Sarodwipa, they had the form of\nthose geese which inhabit the abode of the lakes: entirely isolated from all\nsociety, true Mounis occupied only with divine things, they were named then\n_Nihspriha_ , _Nirmama_ , _Kchanta_ , _Nirdwandwa_ , _Nichparigraha_ ,\n_Nirvriti_ , and _Nirbhrita_. In the midst of their austerities and their\nfastings they died, and returned to life under the form of swans, frequenting\nthe waves of Manasa. The names of these seven brothers were _Padmagarbha_ ,\n_Ravindakcha_ , _Kchiragarbha_ , _Soulotchana_ , _Ourouvindou_ , _Souvindou_\nand _Himagarbha_. In the remembrance of\n\np. 6\n\ntheir past life, they pursued their holy exercises; the fault committed toward\ntheir master, when they were Brahmans, had caused them to retrograde in the\nscale of beings; but the worship which they had then, in the midst even of\ntheir slaying, rendered to the Pitris, had procured for them the faculty of\nadding to their knowledge at each new birth. Finally they returned to the\nworld under the appearance of wild ducks, with the names of _Soumanas_ ,\n_Swani_ , _Souvak_ , _Souddha_ , _Tchitradarsana_ , _Sounetra_ and\n_Soutantra_. By the effect of the acts of penitence which they had performed\nin their various states, their exercises of devotion and their good works, the\ndivine science which they had formerly learned in the lessons of their\ndifferent masters, formed a treasure which went on always accumulating by\ntheir transmigrations. In their new condition of inhabitants of the air, they\ncontinued their holy practices; in their language they spoke only of sacred\nthings, and the _Yoga_ was the only object of their meditations.\n\nSuch was their existence, when Vibhradja, descendant of Pourou and prince of\nthe family of the Nipas, brilliant with beauty, illustrious in power, stately,\nand surrounded by all his house, entered into the forest where these birds\nlived. Soutantra saw him, and suddenly dazzled by so much riches, formed this\ndesire: "Might I become like this king, if I have acquired any merit by my\nausterities and my penitence! I am unhappy to have fasted and mortified myself\nwithout any fruit."\n\nThen two of the wild ducks his companions said to him: "We\n\np. 7\n\nwish to follow you, and share the destiny of our friend." "So be it," replied\nSoutantra, till then only animated by religious thoughts, and they associated\nthemselves all three in this resolution. Souvak said to him: "Since consulting\nonly your passion, you reject our pious exercises, in order to form earthly\ndesires, hear my words. Be cursed by us: you shall be king at Campilya, and\nthese two friends shall follow you there." Thus the four birds, faithful to\ntheir vocation, addressed imprecations and reproaches to their old companions,\nwhom the desire of a throne had turned aside from the good way. Cursed, fallen\nfrom their devotion, all lost, these three unhappy ones asked pardon from\ntheir comrades. Their despair was touching, and Soumanas spoke to them in the\nname of the others: "Our curse shall have its effect. You shall become men,\nbut you shall return one day to the holy practices of devotion. Soutantra\nshall know the languages of all animals. It is to him we owe the favors with\nwhich the Pitris have loaded us. When we slew the cow of our master, it was he\nwho counselled us to offer her as a sacrifice to the manes: it is therefore to\nhim that we are to attribute the science which we possess, and the devotion\nwhich we have practiced. Yes, one day, hearing some words which will recall to\nyou in a concise manner, a past, the knowledge of which shall have been\nconcealed at the bottom of your souls, you shall abandon all to return to\ndevotion."\n\nAs I was saying, while these seven birds, on the waves of the Manassa,\nnourishing themselves only on air and water, suffered\n\np. 8\n\ntheir bodies to waste away, the king Vibhradja betook himself to these woods,\nsurrounded by all his court, and shining like Indra in the midst of his\ncelestial garden of Nandana. * He saw there these seven birds occupied with\ntheir pious practices: humbled by the comparison which he made of them and\nhimself, he came back all pensive into his city. He had a son extremely\nreligious who was named _Anouha_ , because forgetting this body composed of\nmaterial atoms, he elevated himself ever to the contemplation of the soul.\nSouca gave him for wife his daughter, the illustrious Critwi, no less\nestimable for her good qualities than for her devotion . . .\n\nVibhradja, having yielded the throne to his son Anouha, gave his last advice\nto his subjects, made his adieu to the Brahmans, and betook himself to the\nborders of the lake where he had seen the seven friends, in order to do\npenance there. There, fasting, contenting himself with air for all\nnourishment, renouncing every kind of desire, he thought only of mortifying\nthe body. His object, however, was to obtain by force of his austerities the\nprivilege of becoming the son of one of these beings whom he admired. The\nardor of his penitence soon gave to Vibhradja a luminous appearance. He was\nlike a sun which enlightened all the forest. O son of Courou, this wood was\nfrom his name called _Vebhradja_ , as well as the lake, where the four birds,\nconstant in devotion, and the three others, who had strayed from the good\nroad, abandoned their mortal coil.\n\np. 9\n\nThen all together and in harmony they betook themselves to Campilya; and there\nthese seven noble and holy souls, purified by science, meditation and\npenitence, and instructed in the Vedas and the Vedangas, underwent a new\nbirth. But there were only four who preserved a memory of the past; the three\nothers found themselves in the shades of their folly.\n\nSoutantra became the son of Anouha, and was the glorious Brahmadatta; the\ndesire which he had formed, when he was a bird, was thus accomplished. As for\nTchitradarsana and Sounetra, they were born into a family of Brahmans: they\nwere sons of Babhravya and of Vatsa, able in the science of the Vedas and of\nthe Vedangas, and friends of Brahmadatta, as they had been in their preceding\nbirths. One was named _Pantchala:_ it was he who, in the various\ntransmigrations, had been the fifth; the sixth was called then _Candarica_.\nBrahmadatta had been the seventh. Pantchala, learned in the Rig-veda, was a\ngreat Atcharya; * Candarica possessed two Vedas, the Sama and the Yadjour. The\nking, son of Anouha, had the privilege of knowing the language of all beings.\nHe cultivated the friendship of Pantchala and of Candarica. Delivered, like\ncommon men, to the empire of the senses and the passions, on account of what\nthey had done in their preceding births, they nevertheless knew how to\ndistinguish the requirements of duty from desires and from luxury.\n\nThe excellent prince Anouha, after having crowned king the virtuous\nBrahmadatta, animated by devotion, entered on the\n\np. 10\n\nway which leads to heaven. Brahmadatta married the daughter of Devala, called\n_Sannati_ , and who owed this name to the respect which she inspired. Her\nfather had instructed her himself in the great science of devotion, and her\nvirtue was such that she was destined to be born only once on earth.\n\nThe four friends, who had followed Pantchala, Candarica, and Brahmadatta to\nCampilya, were born into a family of Brahmans very poor. These four brothers\nwere named _Dhritiman_ , _Soumanas_ , _Vidwan_ and _Tatwadarsin;_ profound in\nthe reading of the Vedas, and penetrating all the secrets of nature, they\nunited all the knowledge which they had gathered in their previous existences.\nHappy in the exercise of their devotion, they wished still to go and perfect\nthemselves in solitude. They told it to their father, who cried out: "It is to\nfail in your duty to abandon me thus. How can you quit me, leaving me in\npoverty, taking away from me my children who are my only riches, and depriving\nme of their services." These Brahmans replied to this afflicted and\ndisconsolate father: "We are about to give you the means of coming out of this\nstate of poverty. Hear these words: they will procure you great riches. Go\nfind the virtuous king Brahmadatta, repeat them to him before his counsellors.\nHappy at hearing you, he will give you lands and riches, he will crown at last\nall your desires. Go, and be satisfied." Then they told him certain words, and\nafter having honored him as their spiritual master, they gave themselves only\nto the practice of the Yoga, and obtained the final emancipation. *\n\np. 11\n\nThe son of Brahmadatta was Vibhradja himself, born again; animated by piety,\nand covered with glory, he was named _Viswaksena_. One day Brahmadatta, his\nsoul content and happy, was walking in a wood with his wife: he resembled\nIndra accompanied by Satchi. This prince heard there the voice of an ant: it\nwas a lover who sought to bend his mistress by his tender language. In picking\nup the answer of the passionate lover, and thinking of the littleness of their\nbeing, Brahmadatta could not help laughing out loud. Sannati appeared offended\nat it and blushed. Her resentment went so far as to make her refuse to eat:\nher husband wished in vain to appease her. She replied to him with a bitter\nsmile: "O prince, you laughed at me, I can no longer live." The king told her\nthe truth such as it was. She was unwilling to believe it, and replied to him\nwith wounded feelings: "O prince, that is not in nature. What man can know the\nlanguage of the ants? unless it is an effect of the favor of a god\nrecompensing the good actions of a preceding life, or the fruit of a great\npenitence, or the result of a supernatural science. O king, if it is true that\nyou have this power, if you know the language of all beings, deign to\ncommunicate to me your knowledge, or let me die, as truly cursed by you."\n\nBrahmadatta was touched by the tender complaints of the queen: he had recourse\nto the protection of Narayana, lord of all beings. Abstracted and fasting for\nsix nights, he adored him: then this glorious prince, in a vision perceived\nthe god, who is the love of all nature, and who said to him: "Brahmadatta,\ntomorrow\n\np. 12\n\nmorning thou shalt have good fortune." Thus spoke the god, and disappeared.\n\nIn the meanwhile the father of the four Brahmans having learned from his\nchildren the mysterious words which they had communicated to him, regarded\nhimself as sure of his object. He sought a moment when he might meet the king\nwith his counsellors, and could not for some time find the moment to make him\nhear the words which he had to say to him. Narayana had rendered his oracle;\nthe king, satisfied with his answer, had performed the ablution of his head,\nand mounted upon a chariot all shining with gold, was reentering into the\ncity. The chief of the Brahmans, Candarica, was holding the reins of the\nhorses, and the son of Babhravya was bearing the chowri * and the royal fan.\n"This is the moment," said the Brahman to himself, and immediately he\naddressed these words to the king and to his two companions: "The seven\nhunters of the country of Dasarna, the stags of mount Calandjara, the geese of\nSarodwipa, the swans of Manassa were anciently in Couroukchetra ** Brahmans\ninstructed in the Vedas: in this long voyage why then do you remain behind?"\nAt these words Brahmadatta remained speechless, as well as his two friends\nPantchala and Candarica. Seeing the one let fall the reins and the standard,\nand the other the royal fan, the spectators and courtiers were struck with\nastonishment. In a moment, the king elevated upon the car with his two\ncompanions, recovered his senses and continued his route. But all three\nrecalling to\n\np. 13\n\nmind the borders of the sacred lake, recovered at the same time their ancient\nsentiments of devotion. They loaded with riches the Brahman, giving him\nprecious stones and other presents. Brahmadatta yielded his throne to\nViswaksena, and caused him to be crowned king: as for him, he retired into the\nforest with his wife. There the pious daughter of Devala, Sannati, happy to\ngive herself only to devotion, said to her husband: "O great king, I knew very\nwell that you were acquainted with the language of the ants; but by feigning\nanger, I wished to warn you that you were in the chains of the passions. We\nare going now to follow the sublime road which is the object of our desires.\nIt is I who have reawakened in you this love of devotion which was there only\nslumbering." The prince was charmed at this discourse of his wife: and by\nmeans of devotion, to which he consecrated himself with all the forces of his\nsoul he entered into that superior way to which it is difficult to arrive.\n\nCandarica, animated by the same zeal, was as able in the science of the\n_Sankhya_ as in that of the Yoga, and purified by his works, he obtained\nperfection and the mysterious union with God.\n\nPantchala labored to explain the rules of the holy law, and applied himself to\ndevelop all the precepts of pronunciation; he was master in the divine art of\ndevotion, and by his penitence he acquired a high glory.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[3:*](tsb05.htm#fr_1) Worship offered to the Pitris or fathers.\n\n[4:*](tsb05.htm#fr_2) An act of piety in which the penitent collects himself,\nand holds his breath, until the prayer which he repeats mentally is ended.\n\n[5:*](tsb05.htm#fr_3) An exercise of penance or extreme devotion.\n\n[8:*](tsb05.htm#fr_4) The Elysium of Indra.\n\n[9:*](tsb05.htm#fr_5) A spiritual teacher.\n\n[10:*](tsb05.htm#fr_6) That is, they died to be born no more on earth.\n\n[12:*](tsb05.htm#fr_7) A fly-flap made of the tail of a Tartary cow.\n\n[12:**](tsb05.htm#fr_8) A part of India.\n\n\n\n'
