Be it told that when Valmiki came to know of\nthe adventures and achievements of the great prince, he went towards the river\nto bathe, musing the while. It chanced that two fond herons disported on the\nbank, when suddenly a passing huntsman shot the male bird, which at once fell\ndead in a pool of blood. Great was the grief of the female heron, and\nValmiki\'s heart was so deeply moved by its cries of distress that he gave\nutterance to his emotions in a stream of metrical speech. In this manner was\nthe _sloka_ metre invented. Then came towards the brooding poet the supreme\ngod Brahma, who smiled and commanded him to celebrate the story of Rama in the\npoetic measure which, involuntarily, he had invented. Valmiki prepared himself\naccordingly to fulfil the desire of Brahma. He sat upon a carpet of\n\n\n\n[![A VAISHNAVAITE NUN READING THE RAMAYANA](tn/37400.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/37400.jpg)  \nA VAISHNAVAITE NUN READING THE RAMAYANA  \n\n\n\np. 375\n\n[paragraph continues] Kusa grass, sipped holy water, and became absorbed in\nthought, until visions of the story were revealed before his eyes. Sloka by\nsloka and book by book, he composed the Ramayana; and as long as mountains\nendure and rivers run towards the sea, so long will it be repeated by the lips\nof mankind.\n\nValmiki sang that in days of yore there were two mighty kingdoms in sun-bright\nHindustan, and these were Ko\xc2\xb4sala, whose King was Dasarat\xc2\xb4ha, father of Rama,\nand Mit\xc2\xb4hila, 1 which was ruled over by Jan\xc2\xb4aka, the father of beauteous Sita.\n\nNow the capital of Kosala was Ayodhya 2, which shone in splendour like to\nIndra\'s celestial city; it had wide streets with large dwellings, richly\ndecorated temples, towering like mountains, and grand and noble palaces. In\nthe palace gardens there were numerous birds and flowers, shady groves of\nfruit trees, and lakes gemmed with bee-loved lotuses; the soft winds were wont\nto beat back the white water-blooms from the honey bees as coy maidens are\nwithheld by the impulses of modesty from their eager lovers. Birds disported\non the gleaming lakes, kingfishers were angered to behold themselves mirrored\nin the depths, thinking they gazed upon rivals, and ruffled the waters with\ntheir flapping wings. . . . The city of Ayodhya was full of prosperous and\nhappy people.\n\nMaharajah Dasaratha, who was of the Solar Race, dwelt in a stately palace; it\nwas surrounded by strong walls, and guarded by a thousand warriors fierce as\nflames of consuming fire, and ever watchful like to mountain lions which\nprotect their dens. Eight sage counsellors served the monarch with devotion,\nand he had two family priests, Vasishtha and Vamadeva.\n\np. 376\n\nBut although Dasaratha was mighty and powerful, and prospered greatly, his\nheart was full of sorrow because that no son had been born to him by either of\nhis three queens, Kausalya, Kaikeyi, and Sumitra. . . . At length he resolved\nto perform the Aswamedha (horse sacrifice) so that the gods might be prevailed\nupon to grant him an heir who would perpetuate his race. When his will was\nmade known to the queens, their faces brightened as the lotus brightens at the\npromise of spring.\n\nSo it came to pass that a black horse was let loose on the night of the full\nmoon of the month of Choitro 1. A Brahman accompanied it, and after wandering\nfor a full year, the animal returned again to the kingdom. 2\n\nMany rajahs attended the ceremony which took place on the north bank of the\nSarayu river. Twenty-one sacrificial posts were set up for the birds, and\nbeasts, and reptiles, which were to be offered up besides the horse, and there\nwere eighteen Homa pits. When the fire was kindled upon the altar, Kausalya,\nthe chief queen, slew the horse with the sacred scimitar, while the Brahmans\nchanted mantras. . . . All night long Kausalya and Kaikeyi, wives of the\nMaharajah, sat beside the horse\'s body, as was needful in performance of the\nrite. . . . Portions of the flesh were duly given to the fire, and when the\nceremony was completed, Dasaratha awarded great gifts of kine and treasure to\nthe Brahmans.\n\nAn oblation was afterwards offered to the gods, who came to the place of\nsacrifice with the music-loving Gandharvas, the Celestial saints, the Siddhas\n3, and seven Deva-rishis. Brahma came with Vishnu and Shiva, and\n\np. 377\n\n[paragraph continues] Indra came also with the hastening Maruts. Ere they\ndeparted, the gods promised that four sons would be born to Dasaratha.\n\nAfter this, Indra and the other gods 1 journeyed to the heaven of Brahma, and\nspake regarding Ravana 2, the monarch of demons, who had his dwelling in\nLanka. 3\n\nNow Ravana had performed such great penances that Brahma rendered him\ninvulnerable to gods and demons, with the result that the demon made Yama, god\nof death, his slave, and put Agni and Vayu, and the sun and moon, under\nsubjection; indeed, he oppressed all the gods and obstructed sacrifices and\ndespoiled the Brahmans. So Indra and other minor deities entreated Brahma to\ndeliver them from the sway of Ravana.\n\nBrahma heard the gods, and then conducted them to Vishnu\'s dwelling in the\nOcean of Milk. Indra and the others honoured the Preserver, and cried: "O Lord\nof the Universe, remove the afflictions which press heavily upon us. Brahma\nhath blessed Ravana, nor can recall his gift. Save us, therefore, from the\noppression of the demon king."\n\nVishnu spake and said: "Be not afraid, for I shall deliver you all. Ravana\nentreated Brahma for protection against all beings save the apes and men. Go\ntherefore towards the earth, ye gods, and assume the guise of apes, and lo! I\nwill divide myself into four parts and be born as the four sons of Maharajah\nDasaratha. When I shall battle against Ravana, you will hasten to mine aid."\n\nIt came to pass that the wives of Dasaratha, who had eaten of sacrificial\nfood, became the mothers of sons\n\np. 378\n\n[paragraph continues] Kausalya of Rama, Kaikeyi of Bharata, and Sumitra of\nLaksh\xc2\xb4mana, and Satrughna. The people of the kingdom rejoiced greatly; they\ndanced and sang and decked Ayodhya with streamers and flower garlands.\n\nOf the four children Rama was the most beautiful: lying in his white cradle he\nwas like to a blue lotus bloom amidst the gleaming waves of the Ganges.\nVasishtha, the wise Brahman, perceived that he had all the marks of Vishnu,\nand revealed his knowledge to the Maharajah, by whom the child was well\nbeloved. One evening the full moon rose in all its splendour, and Rama\nstretched out his hands because he desired to have it for a toy. His mother\nbought him jewels, but he threw them from him and wailed and wept until his\neyes were red and swollen. Many of the women assembled round the cradle in\ndeep concern. One said that the child was hungry, but he refused to drink;\nanother that the Sasti was unpropitious, and offerings were at once made to\nthat goddess; still Rama wept. A third woman declared that a ghost haunted and\nterrified the child, and mantras were chanted.\n\nWhen the women found that they were unable to soothe Kausalya\'s son, the\nMaharajah was called, but Rama heeded him not. In his despair Dasaratha sent\nfor his chief counsellor, who placed in Rama\'s hands a mirror which reflected\nthe moon. Then the little prince was comforted, believing that he had obtained\nthe moon; he ceased to weep, and everyone was put at ease once again.\n\nWhen the children grew older they began to lisp words, and as they were unable\nto pronounce "peeta" and "mata" 1 they said "pa" and "ma". If Rama were asked\nhis name, he answered "Ama". Sometimes\n\np. 379\n\nthe Maharajah sat among his sage counsellors with the little boy upon his\nknee.\n\nIn their third year the princes had their ears pierced, and after that they\nplayed with other children. They made clay images of gods and put clay\nofferings in their mouths, and they broke the images because they would not\neat.\n\nTheir education began when they were five years old. Vasishtha was the\npreceptor, and first he worshipped Saraswati, goddess of learning, and\ninstructed his pupils to make offerings of flowers and fruit. They received\ninstruction daily, beginning with the alphabet; then they studied grammar, and\nat length they mastered eighteen languages; they were also instructed in music\nand dancing and painting, and in all the sciences. From time to time the\nprinces were examined by their royal sire in the presence of his counsellors.\nAfterwards they were trained to exercise in arms and take part in military\nsports, and they became skilled archers, and elephant riders, and horsemen and\ncharioteers. Of all the princes Rama was the most accomplished; he rose above\nthe others like to a flag which flutters proudly above a high dome.\n\nNow when the princes were sixteen years old, their royal sire began to\nconsider what brides should be selected for them. It chanced that while he was\ndiscussing this matter one day with his counsellors, Vishwamitra paid a visit\nto the palace. Dasaratha welcomed him with due honours, and spake saying:\n"Speak and tell what is thy request so that I may grant it speedily."\n\nThat mighty sage, who had been a Kshatriya in former times, but became a\nBrahman after practising rigid and long austerities, made answer and said: "O\nMaharajah, the Rakshasas are destroying our sacrificial\n\np. 380\n\nofferings, and I pray you to permit Rama to return with me to my hermitage,\nfor he is mighty and brave and young and is able to overpower the demons."\n\nReluctantly did Dasaratha consent, but not until Vasishtha had reassured him,\nand he commanded that Lakshmana should accompany Rama to the hermitage. Then\nthe princes took leave of their parents and went away with Vishwamitra.\n\nOn the first night they abode in a hermitage situated where the river Sarayu\npours into the Ganges, and the sage informed the princes that on that very\nspot Shiva had been wounded by the arrows of Kamadeva, god of love, whom he\nangrily consumed with the fire that issued from his third eye.\n\nNext day the sage led the two princes towards a dark and fearsome jungle\nhaunted by numerous beasts of prey, in which dwelt the terrible Rakshasa woman\nnamed Taraka, mother of Maricha; 1 she was misshapen and horrible, and\ncontinually ravaged all that country. Rama twanged his bow to challenge her,\nand she came towards the princes roaring angrily and throwing boulders. Be-\ncause she was a female, the sons of Dasaratha were reluctant to cause her\ndeath. Rama shot arrows and cut off both her arms, and Lakshmana deprived her\nof nose and ears. She immediately changed her shape and became invisible, but\nby the power of sorcery continued to cause many stones to fall in showers\nabout the young heroes. Vishwamitra urged Rama to slay her, and, guided by\nsound alone, he shot a great arrow which caused her death. Then the sage\nrejoiced greatly, and embracing Rama kissed his head.\n\nIn the morning Vishwamitra chanted powerful mantras,\n\np. 381\n\nwhich caused Celestial weapons to appear for Rama, and the spirits of the\nweapons stood before the prince with clasped hands and said: " _We are thy\nservants, O nobly generous one. Good betide thee! Whatever thou dost desire,\nlo! we shall accomplish for thee_." 1\n\nSaid Rama: "When I have need of you, I will think of you, and then you will\nwait upon me."\n\nThereafter Vishwamitra led the princes to his hermitage, which was situated in\na pleasant grove where deer disported and birds sang sweetly. All the sages\nwelcomed them. It chanced that when six days had gone past, the Brahmans\nprepared to offer up a sacrifice. Suddenly a band of Rakshasas, led by\nMaricha, son of the hag Taraka and Savahu, rushed towards the altar to defile\nthe offering with bones and blood. Rama thought of his Celestial weapons, and\nthey immediately appeared beside him. He cast one at Maricha which drove him\nhundreds of miles out to sea, and he threw a fire weapon at Savahu which\nconsumed him; then he attacked and slew all the other demons. . . . The sages\nrejoiced greatly, and honoured the prince.\n\nNext morning Vishwamitra informed Rama and Lakshmana that he and the other\nsages purposed to attend a great sacrifice which was to be offered up by\nJanaka, Rajah of Mithila. "You will accompany us," he said, "and the rajah\nwill show you Shiva\'s great bow, which neither god nor man can break."\n\nNow, both while they abode at the hermitage and as they journeyed towards\nMithila, the princes heard the sacred legends of Vishnu in his dwarf\nincarnation, of the Churning of the Ocean, of the descent of Ganga through\nShiva\'s hair, and of the cursing of Indra by a sage.\n\np. 382\n\nAt length they reached the capital of Janaka, 1 King of Mithila, who welcomed\nVishwamitra, and said: "Who are these courageous young men with the majesty of\nelephants and the fearlessness of tigers? Comely are they as the twin Aswins."\n\nSaid the sage: "These are sons of Dasaratha; they are slayers of Rakshasas,\nand desire greatly to behold Shiva\'s mighty bow."\n\nThen the monarch spake to the nobles and warriors, and said: "Bring forth the\nbow."\n\nHis command was immediately obeyed. From an inner hall many stalwart men\nhauled the stupendous bow on an eight-wheeled iron chariot into the presence\nof the monarch of Mithila.\n\n"Behold the bow of Shiva!" cried the warriors.\n\nSaid Janaka: "Behold the mighty bow which has been treasured by generations of\nkings. Many rajahs and warriors have endeavoured in vain to bend it; even\nRakshasas and Asuras have failed; the gods themselves quail before it. . . .\nTo the rajah who can bend this mighty weapon I will give in marriage my\ndaughter, the beauteous Sita."\n\nRama gazed with wonder, and then said: "Permit me to lift and bend thy bow."\n\nWondering greatly at these words, the monarch and many high nobles and strong\nwarriors gathered round about. . . . With smiling face, Rama lifted the bow;\nthen proudly he strung it, whereat those who looked on were all amazed. . . .\nThe prince put forth his strength and bent the bow with resistless force until\nit snapped in the middle with a terrible noise like to thunder; the earth\n\np. 383\n\nshook and the mountains echoed aloud. . . . At the loud crash, which resembled\nthe roar of Indra\'s thunderbolt, all who were present fell down stunned and\nterrified save Janaka and Vishwamitra and the two sons of Dasaratha.\n\nSaid the monarch: "Now have mine eyes beheld a great wonder. Peerless is Rama,\nthe noble one, and he shall be given for wife my daughter Sita, who is dearer\nto me than life. . . . Let speedy messengers hasten unto Dasaratha and bid him\nto come hither."\n\nWhen Dasaratha reached Janaka\'s capital, Rama and Sita were wedded amidst\ngreat rejoicings.\n\nHappy were the lovers together. When they arrived at Ayodhya the people\nwelcomed them, and Dasaratha\'s queens embraced and kissed the soft-eyed bride\nof peerless fame.\n\nIt is told that on their honeymoon they loved to wander in the moonlight. On a\nnight of warmth and beauty they went to the banks of a pond which sparkled\nwith lotus blooms.\n\nSaid Rama: "My loved one, graceful art thou as the lotus, thy hair is like\nsilken moss, thine eyes like beautiful bees; fair is thy face as the moon\'s\nsoft image amidst the waters, thine arms are shapely lotus stalks, and thy\nbosom is like to buds of sweet lotus, O my peerless bride."\n\nThey plunged together into the cool, moon-swept waters, and Rama cast at his\nbride many fair water blooms. Sita retreated before him until she went beyond\nher depth; then she clung lovingly to Rama, twining her arms about his neck,\nnor did he hasten to draw her back, so dearly he loved to be embraced by her.\n\nHide-and-seek they then played amidst the floating flowers. Rama sank down\nuntil his face only was seen,\n\np. 384\n\nand Sita, who searched for him, knew not whether she saw the face of Rama or a\nblue lotus bloom on the surface of the pond. Bending down to smell what seemed\nto be a flower, she touched her lover\'s lips, and he kissed her sweetly. Then\nSita hid herself, and her face was like to a lotus bloom among lotus blooms.\nRama kissed her many times ere she moved or smiled. . . . At length they\ndarted merrily from the pond in bright moonlight, their garments dripping\nsparkling water drops, and then they drank cups of honey; the heart of Sita\nwas intoxicated, and she babbled words of love and sweetness. . . .\n\nRama and Sita spent happy hours together, sharing supreme joy like to Vishnu\nand peerless Lakshmi in the bright Celestial regions.\n\nThe Maharajah Dasaratha was growing old, and his counsellors and the people\nbegan to consider who should be appointed Yuvarajah (Young Rajah), to take\nover the duties of sovereignty and allow the monarch to spend his closing\nyears in preparation for death, so that he might secure heaven in the next\nlife.\n\nAll the sages and chieftains favoured the choice of Rama, and the heart of\nDasaratha was filled with joy. The people rejoiced also when it was told to\nthem that Rama was to become their ruler, and they raised shouts of triumph\nand gladness. Then Rama was sent for, and the Maharajah blessed him and bade\nhim to spend the night in Vishnu\'s temple with his wife Sita, to prepare for\nthe ceremony of installation on the morrow. That night the city of Ayodhya was\nilluminated, and the people prepared to decorate the streets with garlands and\nstreamers when the dawn came.\n\nNow there was one who did not rejoice, because that she hated Rama, son of the\nqueen Kausalya. This was the old nurse of Prince Bharata, son of the queen\n\np. 385\n\n[paragraph continues] Kaikeyi 1. Her name was Manthara; she had been the slave\nof Kaikeyi while that queen yet abode in the palace of her sire, the rajah\nAswapati. Ugly and misshapen was Manthara; she was short-necked, flat-\nbreasted, and had legs like a crane; she was big-bellied and humpbacked. When\nRama was a child she had offended him and he smote her, and ever afterwards\nshe regarded him with fierce enmity.\n\nIt chanced that Kaikeyi was gazing idly from the palace roof on the\nilluminated and bustling streets, when the hunchbacked slave approached her,\nand said: "Canst thou be merry, O foolish one, on this night? Thou art\nthreatened by dire misfortune. Dasaratha hath deceived thee. Thy son Bharata\nhath been sent to thy father\'s city, so that the son of Kausalya may be\ninstalled as Yuvarajah on the morrow. Henceforth thou wilt be the bondswoman\nof Kausalya, Rama\'s mother, and thou wilt have to wait obediently on the\ncommands of proud Sita. Hasten now and prevent this dread happening."\n\nSaid Kaikeyi: "Why do you hate Rama? He is the eldest son of the chief queen,\nand Bharata could not become Yuvarajah without the consent of Kausalya\'s son,\nwho honours me as he honours his own mother."\n\nManthara fumed with wonder and indignation at these words; then she said:\n"What madness hath blinded thee? What folly maketh thee heedless of the gulf\nof sorrow which awaiteth thee and thy son? I am older than thou art, and have\nseen dark deeds committed in royal houses. Can Bharata become the slave of\nRama? Well I know that jealous Rama will drive thy lordly son into exile and\nmayhap slay him. . . . Arise, thou heedless queen, and save Bharata, lest he\nbe sent to wander alone in the fearsome jungle. Speak thy mandate to the\n\np. 386\n\n[paragraph continues] Maharajah, whose heart hath been captivated by thy\nbeauty. . . . Any other woman but thee would rather die than suffer a rival\nwife to triumph over her."\n\nSaid Kaikeyi, whose heart began to burn with jealous anger: "How can I prevail\nupon Dasaratha to exalt my son and send Rama into exile?"\n\nThen the hunchback reminded Bharata\'s mother that she had been promised two\nboons by her husband. In time past Dasaratha had gone to help Indra to wage\nwar against the demons. He was grievously wounded and would have died, but\nKaikeyi cured him. So he vowed to grant her two boons, and she said: "When I\nhave need of two favours, I will remind thee of thy promise.\n\nManthara spake to the queen mother of Bharata, saying: "Now go to the mourning\nchamber and feign sorrow and anger. The Maharajah will seek thee out, and when\nhe findeth thee demand of him the two boons which he promised aforetime."\n\nSo it came to pass that in the mourning chamber Kaikeyi spake to Dasaratha,\nand said: "Now grant me the two boons as thou didst vow to do, or I shall die\nthis night."\n\nSaid the Maharajah: "Speak thy wishes, and they will be granted. May I never\nachieve bliss if thy desires are not fulfilled."\n\nKaikeyi said: "Let royal deeds redeem royal words. The first boon I ask is\nthat my son Bharata be installed as Yuvarajah; the second is that Rama be\nbanished for fourteen years to live in the jungle as a devotee clad in a robe\nof bark."\n\nWhen Dasaratha heard these awful words he swooned and fell prone like to a\ntempest-smitten tree. . . . At length he recovered his senses, and opening his\neyes,\n\np. 387\n\nsaid: "Have I dreamed a fearsome dream? Do demons torture me? Is my mind\nclouded with madness?" . . .\n\nHushed and trembling, he gazed upon Kaikeyi as a startled deer gazes at a\ntigress. . . . He was as helpless as a serpent which hath been mantra-charmed,\nand for a time he sobbed aloud. . . . At length wrath possessed him, and, red-\neyed and loud-voiced, he reproached her, saying: "Traitress, wouldst thou\nbring ruin to my family? . . . Rama hath never wronged thee; why dost thou\nseek to injure him? O Kaikeyi, whom I have loved and taken to my bosom, thou\nhast crept into my house like a poisonous snake to accomplish my ruin. It is\ndeath to me to part with my brave and noble Rama, now that I am old and\nfeeble. . . . Have pity on me and ask for other boons."\n\nSaid Kaikeyi, coldly and bitterly: "If thou wilt break thy vow now to one who\nsaved thy life, all men will despise thee, and I will drink poison this very\nnight."\n\nDasaratha was made silent a time. Then he spoke with tears, and said:\n"Beautiful art thou, O Kaikeyi. Thou hast taken captive my heart. How can this\nevil desire dwell in thy bosom and darken it with guile? Thou hast entrapped\nme with the bait of thy beauty. . . . Can a father dishonour his well-loved\nson? Rather would I enter hell than send Rama into exile. How can I look upon\nhis face again? How can I suffer to behold him parting with gentle Sita? . . .\nOh! I have drunk of sweet wine mingled with poison. . . . Have pity on me, O\nKaikeyi! I fall at thy feet. . . . I would that Yama would snatch me off in\nthis hour."\n\nSaid Kaikeyi: "If thou dost honour truth thou wilt grant the boons I crave,\nbut if thou wouldst rather break thine oath, let me drink poison now."\n\nDasaratha cried in his grief: "O shadow-robed\n\np. 388\n\n[paragraph continues] Night, decked with stars! arrest the hours that pass by,\nor else give my heart release. Cover with thy darksome mantle my sorrow and my\nshame, and hide this deed of crime from the knowledge of mankind. Let me\nperish ere the dawn; may the sun never rise to shine upon my sin-smeared\nlife."\n\nSo he lamented through the night, and unto Kaikeyi he said: "I grant the\nboons, but I reject thee for ever and thy son Bharata also."\n\nMorning dawned. . . . The city was decorated with streamers and flowers. A\ngolden throne was set up for Rama; the tiger\'s skin was spread for his feet;\nthe white umbrella waited for him. Elephants and chariot horses were\nharnessed. . . . The preparations for the sacrifice were completed. . . . The\ncrowds began to gather in the streets waiting for the Maharajah and noble\nRama, whom all the people loved.\n\nTowards the palace went Sumantra, the chief counsellor. He entered the chamber\nin which Dasaratha had spent the night to awaken him and conduct him to the\nceremony.\n\nKaikeyi met the counsellor and said: "Summon Rama hither, for the Maharajah\nmust speak with him."\n\nWondering greatly, Sumantra hastened to the prince\'s dwelling and spake the\nroyal command. Said Rama: "I will go quickly. Tarry here, O Sita, and await my\nreturn."\n\nSita followed Rama to the doorway and invoked the gods so that they might\nbless and protect him.\n\nThe multitudes of people hailed the prince as he was driven in his chariot\ntowards the palace, and women threw flowers upon him from the housetops. . . .\nHe entered the gate, driving through the first three courts; he dismounted\n\np. 389\n\nand walked across the two inner courts; he then bade his followers to remain\nwithout, and soon he stood before the Maharajah and made humble obeisance.\n\nRama beheld his father sitting beside Kaikeyi; his body was bent, his face was\nworn with grief. Tears fell from Dasaratha\'s eyes as his son kissed his feet\nand the feet of Kaikeyi also; he strove to speak while tears streamed from his\neyes, but all he could utter was, "Oh! Rama." . . . The sorrow of Dasaratha\nrose and fell in his heart like to the waves of a stormy sea.\n\nSaid Rama: "Oh! have I offended my sire? Speak, mother, and tell. Wherefore do\ntears fall from his eyes? Why is his face clouded with grief? . . . I would\nrather die than wound his heart by word or deed."\n\nKaikeyi said: "The Maharajah is not angered, nor is he grief-stricken, but he\nfears to speak his purpose until thou dost promise to serve his will."\n\nSaid Rama: "O speak and I will obey even if I am asked to quaff poison and die\nere my time. My promise is given and my lips have never lied."\n\nKaikeyi said coldly: "The Maharajah vowed to grant two boons when I cured his\nwounds and saved his life, although he repents his promise now like to a man\nof low caste. I have asked him to fulfil his vow, and the boons I crave are\nthat Bharata, whose star is bright, be installed as Yuvarajah, and thou\nshouldst be banished for twice seven years. . . . If thou art ready to obey\nthy father\'s will and preserve his honour, thou wilt depart this day from the\ncity and permit Bharata to govern the kingdom."\n\nDasaratha\'s heart was pierced with agony at these words, but Rama heard them\nunmoved; they fell upon his ears like to sparks falling into the sea. Calmly\nhe spake and said: "I will depart this day in fulfilment of my father\'s vow.\nCheerfully will I obey his command. Let Bharata\n\np. 390\n\nbe summoned quickly from Girivrajah, and I will hasten to the jungle of\nDandaka."\n\nSaid Kaikeyi: "So be it. . . . But tarry not, for thy sire will neither wash\nnor eat until thou hast departed hence."\n\nRama bowed before his sire who was prostrated with sorrow; he bowed before\nKaikeyi also. . . . All the royal attendants wept, but Rama was unmoved as is\nthe ocean when a pot of water is drawn from it or poured in.\n\nHe went towards Kausalya, his mother, who was engaged making offerings to\nVishnu on his behalf; and informed her what had taken place.\n\nKausalya wept and cried: "O dearly beloved, if thou hadst never been born I\nwould not have to suffer this calamity. . . . My son, I am the chief queen,\nbut Kaikeyi hath supplanted me, and I am disliked and neglected by my husband.\n. . . I am old and unable to endure the loss of thee, my son. . . . Hath my\nheart grown hard as rock that it will not break now? Is Yama\'s mansions so\nfull that I am not called away? I have no desire to live any longer. . . . Can\na son obey a sire in his dotage? . . . Rama, Rama, the people will rise in\nrevolt; seize thou the throne, and if thy father remaineth hostile slay him,\nbecause he hath become contemptible before all men, being but a woman\'s\nslave."\n\nLakshmana said: "Mother, thy words are just. Who will dare oppose Rama so long\nas I serve him?"\n\nSaid Kausalya: "Hear the words of thy brother, Rama. If thy sire\'s command\nmust he obeyed so must mine, and I command thee now not to depart to the\njungle. If thou wilt not obey me, I will eat no more food and thou wilt be\nguilty of my death."\n\nRama said: "I must obey my sire\'s command. Permit me, therefore, O mother, to\ndepart now. . . . O Lakshmana,\n\np. 391\n\n[paragraph continues] I have promised my sire to obey. Do not ask me to break\nmy plighted word."\n\nStill Kausalya pleaded with Rama to remain, and he sought to comfort her, but\nher grief was too heavy to be removed, for she loved her son dearly and hated\nher rival Kaikeyi.\n\nWith darkened brow and saddened eyes, Rama then went unto Sita and told her\nall, and said: "My mother is heartbroken, O Sita; she hath need of thee to\nsoothe her grief. O dearly beloved, I must now depart and leave thee. Be ever\nobedient unto Bharata, nor laud me ever, for a rajah cares not to hear another\npraised in his presence."\n\nSaid Sita: "A wife must ever accompany her husband and share his sufferings.\nIf thou must depart to the forest, it is my duty to go before thee and smooth\nthe thorns in thy path. So long as I am with thee I will he happy even in the\njungle. Dearer to me than the palace is the place where I can hold sweet\nconverse with my husband. I will lighten thy burden of sorrow, O Rama, but if\nthou wilt leave me here alone I will surely die."\n\nRama spoke of the perils of the jungle, which was full of wild beasts and\nvenomous reptiles, where food was scarce, and, when found, bitter to taste,\nwhere they would find no home and would have to lie on the bare ground, and\nwhere they would suffer greatly from heat and cold, from tempest and rains. "O\nSita," he cried, "thou art dearer to me than life itself. How can I permit\nthee to suffer for me? My love will grow greater when I know what it is to be\nseparated from thee. . . . Wait here, O loved one, until I return again."\n\nSaid Sita: "I know nor fear the perils and sorrows of the jungle. Rather would\nI sleep with thee on the bare ground than lie here alone on a bed of down.\nWithout\n\np. 392\n\nthee I have no desire to live. . . . Take me with thee, O Rama, and let me\nshare thy sorrow and thy joys. Sweeter will be the jungle with thee beside me\nthan the palace when thou hast departed."\n\nIn vain Rama remonstrated with her, but she refused to be separated from him.\nShe fell at his feet, weeping bitterly, and at length he consented that she\nshould share his sufferings in the jungle.\n\nThen Lakshmana pleaded to accompany Rama also, nor could he be persuaded to\nremain behind.\n\nThereafter Rama and Sita and Lakshmana went together, walking barefooted,\ntowards the palace to bid farewell to the Maharajah and his queens.\n\nRumours of what had happened were passing through the city, and the people\ngazed with sorrow on Rama, his bride and his brother, and some said: "The\nMaharajah is possessed by demons." Others said: "Let us desert the city and\nfollow Rama. Then Bharata will have none left to rule over."\n\nRama entered the palace with his wife and brother, and stood before the\nMaharajah with folded hands.\n\nDasaratha lamented and said: "A woman hath deceived me. She concealed her\nwicked designs in her heart as a fire is concealed by ashes. . . . The evening\nis late; tarry therefore with thy mother and me until day breaks."\n\nSaid Rama: "Kaikeyi commanded me to depart this day to the jungle, and I\npromised to obey. . When fourteen years have gone past we shall return again\nand honour thee."\n\nThe Maharajah and his counsellors desired to send the royal army and the\nhuntsmen and much grain and treasure to the jungle with Rama, although Kaikeyi\nprotested loudly, but Rama refused to have soldiers and\n\np. 393\n\nfollowers, and asked for the raiment of bark which he must wear, and for the\nspade with which to dig roots and the basket to carry them.\n\nThe shameless Kaikeyi then went away and returned with three dresses of bark.\nRama and Lakshmana immediately cast off their royal garments and all their\nornaments, and assumed the rough attire of devotees. But Sita, who from\nchildhood had been clad in silk, wept and said: "How can I wear raiment of\nbark? I cannot use such attire."\n\nAll the women shed tears at these words, and Dasaratha said: "Kaikeyi\'s\ncommand is binding on Rama only, and his wife and brother may assume any\ngarments they desire."\n\nSo the robe of bark was taken away from Sita; it was not permitted that she\nshould be put to shame.\n\nThen Rama and Sita and Lakshmana took leave of all those who were in the\npalace, and, amidst lamentation and wailing, took their departure from the\npalace. They were conveyed to the frontier of the kingdom in a chariot, and\nmany people followed them from the city, resolved to share exile with Rama.\nThe night was spent on the banks of the Tamasa, and all slept save Rama alone.\nAs soon as dawn came, he awakened Sita and Lakshmana and the charioteer, and\ntogether they departed ere the slumbering multitude were aware. The exiles\nthereafter parted with the charioteer, and crossing the river Tamasa,\njourneyed on till they saw the sacred Ganges, in which the gods are wont to\nbathe, and on whose banks many sages had chosen hermitages.\n\nWhen the people awoke and found that those whom they loved and honoured had\nhastened away, they returned with hearts full of sorrow to the mourning city\nof Ayodhya.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[374:1](iml29.htm#fr_326) _Pron_. val-mee\xc2\xb4kee.\n\n[375:1](iml29.htm#fr_327) The kingdoms of Oudh and North Behar.\n\n[375:2](iml29.htm#fr_328) _Pron_. a-yod\xc2\xb4hya.\n\n[376:1](iml29.htm#fr_329) Easter full moon.\n\n[376:2](iml29.htm#fr_330) As we have seen, Arjuna and an army accompanied the\nwhite horse which was sacrificed in the _Mah abharata_.\n\n[376:3](iml29.htm#fr_331) The spirits of ancestors.\n\n[377:1](iml29.htm#fr_332) The Vedic deities.\n\n[377:2](iml29.htm#fr_333) _Pron_. rah\xc2\xb4va-na.\n\n[377:3](iml29.htm#fr_334) He is called a Rakshasa king in the _Ramayana_.\nRavana appears to be the Brahmanical conception of Vritra, the ruler of the\nDanavas or Asuras.
