Fain would I see,  \nAs thou Thyself declar\'st it, Sovereign Lord!  \nThe likeness of that glory of Thy Form  \nWholly revealed. O Thou Divinest One!  \nIf this can be, if I may bear the sight,  \nMake Thyself visible, Lord of all prayers!  \nShow me Thy very self, the Eternal God!  \nKrishna. Gaze, then, thou Son of Pritha! I manifest for thee  \nThose hundred thousand thousand shapes that clothe my Mystery:  \nI show thee all my semblances, infinite, rich, divine,  \nMy changeful hues, my countless forms. See! in this face of mine,  \nAdityas, Vasus, Rudras, Aswins, and Maruts; see  \nWonders unnumbered, Indian Prince! revealed to none save thee.  \nBehold! this is the Universe!- Look! what is live and dead  \nI gather all in one- in Me! Gaze, as thy lips have said  \nOn GOD, ETERNAL, VERY GOD! See ME! what thou prayest!\n\nThou canst not!- nor, with human eyes, Arjuna! ever mayest!  \nTherefore I give thee sense divine. Have other eyes, new light!  \nAnd, look! This is My glory, unveiled to mortal sight!  \nSanjaya. Then, O King! to God, so saying,  \nStood, to Pritha\'s Son displaying  \nAll the splendour, wonder, dread  \nOf His vast Almighty-head.  \nOut of countless eyes beholding,  \nOut of countless mouths commanding,  \nCountless mystic forms enfolding  \nIn one Form: supremely standing  \nCountless radiant glories wearing,  \nCountless heavenly weapons bearing,  \nCrowned with garlands of star-clusters,  \nRobed in garb of woven lustres,  \nBreathing from His perfect Presence  \nBreaths of every subtle essence  \nOf all heavenly odours; shedding  \nBlinding brilliance; overspreading-  \nBoundless, beautiful- all spaces  \nWith His all-regarding faces;  \nSo He showed! If there should rise  \nSuddenly within the skies  \nSunburst of a thousand suns  \nFlooding earth with beams undeemed-of,  \nThen might be that Holy One\'s  \nMajesty and radiance dreamed of!\n\nSo did Pandu\'s Son behold  \nAll this universe enfold  \nAll its huge diversity  \nInto one vast shape, and be  \nVisible, and viewed, and blended  \nIn one Body- subtle, splendid,  \nNameless- th\' All-comprehending  \nGod of Gods, the Never-Ending  \nDeity!\n\nBut, sore amazed,  \nThrilled, o\'erfilled, dazzled, and dazed,  \nArjuna knelt; and bowed his head,  \nAnd clasped his palms; and cried, and said:  \nArjuna. Yea! I have seen! I see!  \nLord! all is wrapped in Thee!  \nThe gods are in Thy glorious frame! the creatures  \nOf earth, and heaven, and hell  \nIn Thy Divine form dwell,  \nAnd in Thy countenance shine all the features\n\nOf Brahma, sitting lone  \nUpon His lotus-throne;  \nOf saints and sages, and the serpent races  \nAnanta, Vasuki;  \nYea! mightiest Lord! I see  \nThy thousand thousand arms and breasts, and faces,\n\nAnd eyes,- on every side  \nPerfect, diversified;  \nAnd nowhere end of Thee, nowhere beginning,  \nNowhere a centre! Shifts-  \nWherever soul\'s gaze lifts-  \nThy central Self, all-wielding, and all-winning!\n\nInfinite King! I see  \nThe anadem on Thee,  \nThe club, the shell, the discus; see Thee burning  \nIn beams insufferable,  \nLighting earth, heaven, and hell  \nWith brilliance blazing, glowing, flashing; turning\n\nDarkness to dazzling day,  \nLook I whichever way;  \nAh, Lord! I worship Thee, the Undivided,  \nThe Uttermost of thought,  \nThe Treasure-Palace wrought  \nTo hold the wealth of the worlds; the Shield provided\n\nTo shelter Virtue\'s laws;  \nThe Fount whence Life\'s stream draws  \nAll waters of all rivers of all being:  \nThe One Unborn, Unending:  \nUnchanging and Unblending!  \nWith might and majesty, past thought, past seeing!\n\nSilver of moon and gold  \nOf sun are glories rolled  \nFrom Thy great eyes; Thy visage, beaming tender  \nThroughout the stars and skies,  \nDoth to warm life surprise  \nThy Universe. The worlds are filled with wonder\n\nOf Thy perfections! Space  \nStar-sprinkled, and void place  \nFrom pole to pole of the Blue, from bound to bound,  \nHath Thee in every spot,  \nThee, Thee!- Where Thou art not,  \nO Holy, Marvellous Form! is nowhere found!\n\nO Mystic, Awful One!  \nAt sight of Thee, made known,  \nThe Three Worlds quake; the lower gods draw nigh Thee;  \nThey fold their palms, and bow  \nBody, and breast, and brow,  \nAnd, whispering worship, laud and magnify Thee!\n\nRishis and Siddhas cry  \n"Hail! Highest Majesty!  \nFrom sage and singer breaks the hymn of glory  \nIn dulcet harmony,  \nSounding the praise of Thee;  \nWhile countless companies take up the story,\n\nRudras, who ride the storms,  \nTh\' Adityas\' shining forms,  \nVasus and Sadhyas, Viswas, Ushmapas;  \nMaruts, and those great Twins  \nThe heavenly, fair, Aswins,  \nGandharvas, Rakshasas, Siddhas, and Asuras,-\n\nThese see Thee, and revere  \nIn sudden-stricken fear;  \nYea! the Worlds,- seeing Thee with form stupendous,  \nWith faces manifold,  \nWith eyes which all behold,  \nUnnumbered eyes, vast arms, members tremendous,\n\nFlanks, lit with sun and star,  \nFeet planted near and far,  \nTushes of terror, mouths wrathful and tender;-  \nThe Three wide Worlds before Thee  \nAdore, as I adore Thee,  \nQuake, as I quake, to witness so much splendour!\n\nI mark Thee strike the skies  \nWith front, in wondrous wise  \nHuge, rainbow-painted, glittering; and thy mouth  \nOpened, and orbs which see  \nAll things, whatever be  \nIn all Thy worlds, east, west, and north and south.\n\nO Eyes of God! O Head!  \nMy strength of soul is fled,  \nGone is heart\'s force, rebuked is mind\'s desire!  \nWhen I behold Thee so,  \nWith awful brows a-glow,  \nWith burning glance, and lips lighted by fire\n\nFierce as those flames which shall  \nConsume, at close of all,  \nEarth, Heaven! Ah me! I see no Earth and Heaven!  \nThee, Lord of Lords! I see,  \nThee only- only Thee!  \nNow let Thy mercy unto me be given,\n\nThou Refuge of the World!  \nLo! to the cavern hurled  \nOf Thy wide-opened throat, and lips white-tushed,  \nI see our noblest ones,  \nGreat Dhritarashtra\'s sons,  \nBhishma, Drona, and Karna, caught and crushed!\n\nThe Kings and Chiefs drawn in,  \nThat gaping gorge within;  \nThe best of both these armies torn and riven!  \nBetween Thy jaws they lie  \nMangled full bloodily,  \nGround into dust and death! Like streams down-driven\n\nWith helpless haste, which go  \nIn headlong furious flow  \nStraight to the gulfing deeps of th\' unfilled ocean,  \nSo to that flaming cave  \nThose heroes great and brave  \nPour, in unending streams, with helpless motion!\n\nLike moths which in the night  \nFlutter towards a light,  \nDrawn to their fiery doom, flying and dying,  \nSo to their death still throng,  \nBlind, dazzled, borne along  \nCeaselessly, all those multitudes, wild flying!\n\nThou, that hast fashioned men,  \nDevourest them again,  \nOne with another, great and small, alike!  \nThe creatures whom Thou mak\'st,  \nWith flaming jaws Thou tak\'st,  \nLapping them up! Lord God! Thy terrors strike\n\nFrom end to end of earth,  \nFilling life full, from birth  \nTo death, with deadly, burning, lurid dread!  \nAh, Vishnu! make me know  \nWhy is Thy visage so?  \nWho art Thou, feasting thus upon Thy dead?\n\nWho? awful Deity!  \nI bow myself to Thee,  \nNamostu Te, Devavara! Prasid!  \nO Mightiest Lord! rehearse  \nWhy hast Thou face so fierce?  \nWhence doth this aspect horrible proceed?  \nKrishna. Thou seest Me as Time who kills,  \nTime who brings all to doom,  \nThe Slayer Time, Ancient of Days, come hither to consume;  \nExcepting thee, of all these hosts of hostile chiefs arrayed,  \nThere stands not one shall leave alive the battlefield! Dismayed  \nNo longer be! Arise! obtain renown! destroy thy foes!  \nFight for the kingdom waiting thee when thou hast vanquished those.  \nBy Me they fall- not thee! the stroke of death is dealt them now,  \nEven as they show thus gallantly; My instrument art thou!  \nStrike, strong-armed Prince, at Drona! at Bhishma strike! deal  \ndeath  \nOn Karna, Jyadratha; stay all their warlike breath!  \n\'Tis I who bid them perish! Thou wilt but slay the slain;  \nFight! they must fall, and thou must live, victor upon this plain!  \nSanjaya. Hearing mighty Keshav\'s word,  \nTrembling that helmed Lord  \nClasped his lifted palms, and- praying  \nGrace of Krishna- stood there, saying,  \nWith bowed brow and accents broken,  \nThese words, timorously spoken:  \nArjuna. Worthily, Lord of Might!  \nThe whole world hath delight  \nIn Thy surpassing power, obeying Thee;  \nThe Rakshasas, in dread  \nAt sight of Thee, are sped  \nTo all four quarters; and the company\n\nOf Siddhas sound Thy name.  \nHow should they not proclaim  \nThy Majesties, Divinest, Mightiest?  \nThou Brahm, than Brahma greater!  \nThou Infinite Creator!  \nThou God of gods, Life\'s Dwelling-place and Rest.\n\nThou, of all souls the Soul!  \nThe Comprehending Whole!  \nOf being formed, and formless being the Framer;  \nO Utmost One! O Lord!  \nOlder than eld, Who stored  \nThe worlds with wealth of life! O Treasure-Claimer,\n\nWho wottest all, and art  \nWisdom Thyself! O Part  \nIn all, and All; for all from Thee have risen  \nNumberless now I see  \nThe aspects are of Thee!  \nVayu Thou art, and He who keeps the prison\n\nOf Narak, Yama dark;  \nAnd Agni\'s shining spark;  \nVaruna\'s waves are Thy waves. Moon and starlight  \nAre Thine! Prajapati  \nArt Thou, and \'tis to Thee  \nThey knelt in worshipping the old world\'s far light,\n\nThe first of mortal men.  \nAgain, Thou God! again  \nA thousand thousand times be magnified!  \nHonour and worship be-  \nGlory and praise,- to Thee  \nNamo, Namaste, cried on every side;  \nCried here, above, below,  \nUttered when Thou dost go,  \nUttered where Thou dost come! Namo! we call;  \nNamostu! God adored!  \nNamostu! Nameless Lord  \nHail to Thee! Praise to Thee Thou One in all;\n\nFor Thou art All! Yea, Thou!  \nAh! if in anger now  \nThou shouldst remember I did think Thee Friend,  \nSpeaking with easy speech,  \nAs men use each to each;  \nDid call Thee "Krishna," "Prince," nor comprehend\n\nThy hidden majesty,  \nThe might, the awe of Thee;  \nDid, in my heedlessness, or in my love,  \nOn journey, or in jest,  \nOr when we lay at rest,  \nSitting at council, straying in the grove,\n\nAlone, or in the throng,  \nDo Thee, most Holy! wrong,  \nBe Thy grace granted for that witless sin  \nFor Thou art, now I know,  \nFather of all below,  \nOf all above, of all the worlds within\n\nGuru of Gurus; more  \nTo reverence and adore  \nThan all which is adorable and high!  \nHow, in the wide worlds three  \nShould any equal be?  \nShould any other share Thy Majesty?\n\nTherefore, with body bent  \nAnd reverent intent,  \nI praise, and serve, and seek Thee, asking grace.  \nAs father to a son,  \nAs friend to friend, as one  \nWho loveth to his lover, turn Thy face\n\nIn gentleness on me!  \nGood is it I did see  \nThis unknown marvel of Thy Form! But fear  \nMingles with joy! Retake,  \nDear Lord! for pity\'s sake  \nThine earthly shape, which earthly eyes may bear!\n\nBe merciful, and show  \nThe visage that I know;  \nLet me regard Thee, as of yore, arrayed  \nWith disc and forehead-gem,  \nWith mace and anadem,  \nThou that sustainest all things! Undismayed\n\nLet me once more behold  \nThe form I loved of old,  \nThou of the thousand arms and countless eyes!  \nThis frightened heart is fain  \nTo see restored again  \nMy Charioteer, in Krishna\'s kind disguise.\n\nKrishna. Yea! thou hast seen, Arjuna! because I loved thee well,  \nThe secret countenance of Me, revealed by mystic spell,  \nShining, and wonderful, and majestic, manifold,  \nWhich none save thou in all the years had favour to behold;  \nFor not by Vedas cometh this, nor sacrifice, nor alms,  \nNor works well-done, nor penance long, nor prayers, nor chanted  \npsalms,  \nThat mortal eyes should bear to view the Immortal Soul unclad,  \nPrince of the Kurus! This was kept for thee alone! Be glad!  \nLet no more trouble shake thy heart, because thine eyes have seen  \nMy terror with My glory. As I before have been  \nSo will I be again for thee; with lightened heart behold!  \nOnce more I am thy Krishna, the form thou knew\'st of old!  \nSanjaya. These words to Arjuna spake  \nVasudev, and straight did take  \nBack again the semblance dear  \nOf the well-loved charioteer;  \nPeace and joy it did restore  \nWhen the Prince beheld once more  \nMighty BRAHMA\'S form and face  \nClothed in Krishna\'s gentle grace.  \nArjuna. Now that I see come back, Janardana!  \nThis friendly human frame, my mind can think  \nCalm thoughts once more; my heart beats still again!  \nKrishna. Yea! it was wonderful and terrible  \nTo view me as thou didst, dear Prince! The gods  \nDread and desire continually to view!  \nYet not by Vedas, nor from sacrifice,  \nNor penance, nor gift-giving, nor with prayer  \nShall any so behold, as thou hast seen!  \nOnly by fullest service, perfect faith,  \nAnd uttermost surrender am I known  \nAnd seen, and entered into, Indian Prince!  \nWho doeth all for Me; who findeth Me  \nIn all; adoreth always; loveth all  \nWhich I have made, and Me, for Love\'s sole end,  \nThat man, Arjuna! unto Me doth wend.\n\nHERE ENDETH CHAPTER XI OF THE  \nBHAGAVAD-GITA,  \nEntitled "Viswarupadarsanam,"  \nOr "The Book of the Manifesting of the  \nOne and Manifold."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 12: Of the Religion of Faith](bg12.htm)\n\n'
