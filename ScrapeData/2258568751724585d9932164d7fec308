For the\nfirst time in the history of the world\'s Great Saviours, the exact words of\nthe Master were recorded _verbatim_ by one of His devoted disciples. These\nwords were originally spoken in the Bengali language of India. They were taken\ndown in the form of diary notes by a householder disciple, "M." At the request\nof Sri Ramakrishna\'s Sannyasin disciples, however, these notes were published\nat Calcutta during 1902-1903 A.D., in Bengali, in two volumes, entitled " _R\namakrishna Kathamrita_."\n\nAt that time "M" wrote to me letters authorizing me to edit and publish the\nEnglish translation of his notes, and sent me the manuscript in English which\nhe himself translated, together with a true copy of a personal\n\np. viii\n\nletter * which Swami Vivekananda wrote to him.\n\nAt the request of "M" I have edited and remodelled the larger portion of his\nEnglish manuscript; while the remaining portions I\n\np. ix\n\nhave translated directly from the Bengali edition of his notes. The marginal\nheadings, foot-notes, and index, as well as the division of the Gospel into\nfourteen chapters, were added by me. I have endeavored to make every word of\nthis edition as literal, simple, and colloquial as possible.\n\nSome repetitions are purposely kept to show how the Master used the same\nillustrations on different occasions during the course of His eloquent\nconversations.\n\nThe completed work is now offered to the Western World with the sincere hope\nthat the sublime teachings of Sri Ramakrishna may open the spiritual sight of\nseekers after Truth, and bring peace and freedom to all souls struggling for\nrealization.\n\nSwami Abhedananda.\n\n   New York,  \nDecember 15, 1907.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[viii:*](gork01.htm#fr_0) Swami Vivekananda\'s letter to "M."\n\n( _True Copy_.)\n\nDehra Doon,  \n24th Nov., 1897.\n\nMy dear Master Mahasaya:\n\nMany thanks for your second leaflet. It is indeed wonderful. The move is quite\noriginal, and never the life of a great teacher was brought before the public\nuntarnished by the writer\'s mind as you are doing. The language also is beyond\nall praise. So fresh, so pointed, and withal so plain and easy.\n\nI cannot express in adequate terms how I have enjoyed them. I am really in a\ntransport when I read them. Strange, isn\'t it? Our teacher and Lord was so\noriginal and each one of us will have to be original or nothing. I now under.\nstand why none of us attempted his life before. It has been reserved for you,\nthis great work. He is with you evidently. With all love and namaskar.\n\n(Sd.) Vivekananda.\n\nP.S.--Socratic dialogues are Plato all over. You are entirely hidden.\nMoreover, the dramatic part is infinitely beautiful. Everybody likes it--here\nor in the West.\n\n(Sd.) V.\n\nThis letter of Swami Vivekananda shows that the words of the Master were\naccurately recorded by "M."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Contents](gork02.htm)\n\n'
