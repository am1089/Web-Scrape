Only those previous works\nperish the effects of which have not yet begun to operate; for the text 'For\nhim there is delay as long as he is not delivered from the body' ( _Kh_. Up.\nVI, 14, 2) expressly states when the delay of the body's death will come to an\nend (the body meanwhile continuing to exist through the influence of the\nanarabdhakarya works). There is no proof for the existence of an impetus\naccounting for the continuance of the body's life, other than the Lord's\npleasure or displeasure caused by--good or evil deeds.--Here terminates the\nadhikara _n_ a of 'the works the operation of which has not yet begun.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 16.
