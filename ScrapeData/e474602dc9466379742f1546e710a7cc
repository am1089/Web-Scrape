But _G_ aimini thinks that it has another purport,\n\np. 383\n\non account of the question and answer; and thus some also.\n\nThe 'but' is meant to preclude the idea that the mention made of the\nindividual soul enables us to understand the whole section as concerned with\nthat soul.--The teacher _G_ aimini is of opinion that the mention made of the\nindividual soul has another meaning, i.e. aims at conveying the idea of what\nis different from the individual soul, i.e. the nature of the highest Brahman.\n'On account of question and answer.' According to the story told in the\nUpanishad, A _g_ ata _s_ atru leads Balaki to where a sleeping man is resting,\nand convinces him that the soul is different from breath, by addressing the\nsleeping person, in whom breath only is awake, with names belonging to pra _n_\na 1 without the sleeper being awaked thereby, and after that rousing him by a\npush of his staff. Then, with a view to teaching Balaki the difference of\nBrahman from the individual soul, he asks him the following questions: 'Where,\nO Balaki, did this person here sleep? Where was he? Whence did he thus come\nback?' To these questions he thereupon himself replies, 'When sleeping he sees\nno dream, then he becomes one in that pra _n_ a alone.--From that Self the\norgans proceed each towards its place, from the organs the gods, from the gods\nthe worlds.' Now this reply, no less than the questions, clearly refers to the\nhighest Self as something different from the individual Self. For that\nentering into which the soul, in the state of deep sleep, attains its true\nnature and enjoys complete serenity, being free from the disturbing\nexperiences of pleasure and pain that accompany the states of waking and of\ndream; and\n\np. 384\n\nthat from which it again returns to the fruition of pleasure and pain; that is\nnothing else but the highest Self. For, as other scriptural texts testify\n('Then he becomes united with the True,' _Kh_. Up. VI, 8, 1; 'Embraced by the\nintelligent Self he knows nothing that is without, nothing that is within,' B\n_ri_ , Up. IV, 3, 21), the abode of deep sleep is the intelligent Self which\nis different from the individual Self, i.e. the highest Self. We thus conclude\nthat the reference, in question and answer, to the individual soul subserves\nthe end of instruction being given about what is different from that soul,\ni.e. the highest Self. We hence also reject the Purvapakshin's contention that\nquestion and answer refer to the individual soul, that the veins called hita\nare the abode of deep sleep, and that the well-known clause as to the pra _n_\na must be taken to mean that the aggregate of the organs becomes one in the\nindividual soul called pra _n_ a. For the veins are the abode, not of deep\nsleep, but of dream, and, as we have shown above, Brahman only is the abode of\ndeep sleep; and the text declares that the individual soul, together with all\nits ministering organs, becomes one with, and again proceeds from, Brahman\nonly--which the text designates as Pra _n_ a.--Moreover some, viz. the Va _g_\nasaneyins in this same colloquy of Balaki and A _g_ ata _s_ atru as recorded\nin their text, clearly distinguish from the vi _g_ \xc3\xb1ana-maya, i.e. the\nindividual soul in the state of deep sleep, the highest Self which then is the\nabode of the individual soul. 'Where was then the person, consisting of\nintelligence, and from whence did he thus come back?--When he was thus asleep,\nthen the intelligent person, having through the intelligence of the senses\nabsorbed within himself all intelligence, lies in the ether that is within the\nheart.' Now the word 'ether' is known to denote the highest Self; cf. the text\n'there is within that the small ether'( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 1, 1). This shows us\nthat the individual soul is mentioned in the Va _g_ asaneyin passage to the\nend of setting forth what is different from it, viz. the pra _g \xc3\xb1_a Self, i.e.\nthe highest Brahman. The general conclusion therefore is that the Kaushitaki-\ntext under discussion proposes as\n\np. 385\n\nthe object of knowledge something that is different from the individual soul,\nviz. the highest Brahman which is the cause of the whole world, and that hence\nthe Vedanta-texts nowhere intimate that general causality belongs either to\nthe individual soul or to the Pradhana under the soul's guidance. Here\nterminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'denotation of the world.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[383:1](sbe48160.htm#fr_34) The names with which the king addresses the\nsleeper are _Great one, clad in white raiment, Soma, king._ The _S_ ru. Pra.\ncomments as follows: _Great one_ ; because according to _S_ ruti Pra _n_ a is\nthe oldest and best. _Clad in white raiment_ ; because _S_ ruti says that\nwater is the raiment of Pra _n_ a; and elsewhere, that what is white belongs\nto water. _Soma_ ; because scripture says 'of this pra _n_ a water is the\nbody, light the form, viz. yonder moon.' _King_ ; for _S_ ruti says 'Pra _n_ a\nindeed is the ruler.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 19.
