Now this (Sacrificer), having- conquered by means of the supreme\nStoma--the Katush _t_ oma, the K _ri_ ta among dice 3,--on the next day\nestablishes\n\np. 331\n\nhimself on the Ekavi _m_ _s_ a 1, as a firm foundation: from the Ekavi _m_ _s_\na, as a firm foundation, he subsequently ascends to the next day, the seasons;\nfor the P _ri_ sh _th_ a (-stotras) are the seasons, and the seasons are the\nyear: it is in the seasons, in the year, he establishes himself.\n\n13:3:2:22\\. The _S_ akvari 2 (verses) are the P _ri_ sh _th_ a (-stotra of the\nsecond day): there is a different metre for each (verse), for different kinds\nof animals, both domestic and wild ones, are immolated here on each (day). As\nto the _S_ akvari (verses) being the P _ri_ sh _th_ a, it is for the\ncompleteness of the horse (sacrifice) 3; and different kinds of animals are\nimmolated on different (days), because different stomas are performed on the\ndifferent (days of the A _s_ vamedha).\n\np. 332\n\n13:3:2:33\\. As to this they say, 'These--to wit, goats and sheep and the wild\n(beasts)--are not all animals 1; but those--to wit, the bovine (victims)--are\nindeed all animals.' On the last day he immolates bovine (victims), for they--\nto wit, bovine (victims)--are all animals: he thus immolates all animals. They\nare sacred to the All-gods 2, for the completeness of the horse, for the horse\nis sacred to the All-gods. They are many-formed (or, many-coloured), whence\nanimals are many-formed; and they are of distinct forms (or colours), whence\nanimals are of distinct forms.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[330:3](sbe44095.htm#fr_843) For this and the other names of the dice, see\npart iii, p. 106, note 1.\n\n[331:1](sbe44095.htm#fr_844) Though applying in the first place to the second\nday of the A _s_ vamedha, as an Ukthya sacrifice which is at the same time an\nEkavi _m_ _s_ a day, i.e. one the stotras of which are all chanted in the\ntwenty-one-versed hymn-form, Ekavi _m_ _s_ a, the twenty-first or twenty-one-\nfold, as is clear from [XIII, 3, 3, 3](sbe44096.htm#13:3:3:3), here also\nrefers to the sun, of which it is a common epithet (cf. part iii, p. 265, note\n2, also [XIII, 4, 4, 11](sbe44105.htm#13:4:4:11)). This solar name seems to be\nderived from the fact that the sun is also identified with the central day of\nthe year, the Vishuvant day, which is considered the central day of a twenty-\none days' sacrificial performance--having one p _ri_ sh _th_ ya-sha _d_ aha,\nan Abhi _g_ it (or Vi _s_ va _g_ it day resp.) and three svarasaman days\nbefore and after it;--see [p. 139](sbe44046.htm#page_139), note\n*[1](sbe44046.htm#fn_425)*; and A. Hillebrandt, Die Sonnwendfeste in Alt-\nIndien, p. 6 seqq.\n\n[331:2](sbe44095.htm#fr_845) That is to say, the so-called Mahanamni verses\n(Sam. V. ed. Bibl. Ind. II, p. 371), chanted on the _s_ akvara-saman (see part\niii, of this transl., introd. p. xx, note 2), are to be used for the Hot _ri_\n's P _ri_ sh _th_ a-stotra. For this purpose the Rathantara-saman is\nordinarily used in the Agnish _t_ oma, and the B _ri_ hat-saman in the Ukthya,\nform of sacrifice.\n\n[331:3](sbe44095.htm#fr_846) The commentator takes this as an allusion to the\n'potent' ( _s_ akvara = _s_ akta) nature of the verses.\n\n[332:1](sbe44095.htm#fr_847) That is to say, they do not fitly represent all\nkinds of animals, as the highest kind of animals, the bovine cattle, may be\nsaid to do. The argument as to the 'sarve pa _s_ ava _h_ ' is, of course,\nsuggested by the 'a _s_ vasya sarvatvaya' of the preceding paragraph; and to\nbring out the parallelism, one might translate,--these . . . . are not\ncomplete animals.\n\n[332:2](sbe44095.htm#fr_848) See [XIII, 5, 3, 11](sbe44108.htm#13:5:3:11).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 3, 3.
