Tell me determinately which one of these two is superior.\n\nThe Deity said:\n\nRenunciation and pursuit of action are both instruments of happiness. But of\nthe two, pursuit of action is superior to renunciation of action. He should be\nunderstood to be always an ascetic 3, who has no aversion and no desire. For,\nO you of mighty arms! he who is free from the pairs of opposites is easily\nreleased from (all) bonds. Children--not wise men--talk of sa _n_ khya and\nyoga as\n\np. 64\n\ndistinct. One who pursues either well obtains the fruit of both. The seat\nwhich the sa _n_ khyas obtain is reached by the yogas 1 also. He sees (truly),\nwho sees the sa _n_ khya and yoga as one. Renunciation, O you of mighty arms!\nis difficult to reach without devotion; the sage possessed of devotion attains\nBrahman 2 without delay. He who is possessed of devotion, whose self is pure,\nwho has restrained his self 3, and who has controlled his senses, and who\nidentifies his self with every being, is not tainted though he performs\n(actions). The man of devotion, who knows the truth, thinks he does nothing at\nall, when he sees 4, hears, touches, smells, eats, move-b, sleeps, breathes,\ntalks, throws out 5, takes, opens or closes the eyelids; he holds that the\nsenses deal with the objects of the senses. He who, casting off (all)\nattachment, performs actions dedicating them to Brahman, is not tainted by\nsin, as the lotus-leaf 6 (is not tainted) by water. Devotees, casting off\nattachment, perform actions for attaining purity of self, with the body, the\nmind, the understanding, or even the senses 7\\--(all) free (from\n\np. 65\n\negoistic notions). He who is possessed of devotion, abandoning the fruit of\nactions, attains the highest tranquillity. He who is without devotion, and\nattached to the fruit (of action), is tied down by (reason of his) acting in\nconsequence of (some) desire. The self-restrained, embodied (self) lies at\ncase within the city of nine portals 1, renouncing all actions by the mind,\nnot doing nor causing (any thing) to be done. The Lord is not the cause of\nactions, or of the capacity of performing actions amongst men, or of the\nconnexion of action and fruit. But nature only works. The Lord receives no\none\'s sin, nor merit either. Knowledge is enveloped by ignorance, hence all\ncreatures are deluded 2. But to those who have destroyed that ignorance by\nknowledge of the self, (such) knowledge, like the sun, shows forth that\nsupreme (principle). And those whose mind is (centred) on it, whose (very)\nself it is, who are thoroughly devoted to it, and whose final goal it is, go\nnever to return, having their sins destroyed by knowledge. The wise look upon\na Brahma _n_ a possessed of learning and humility, on a cow, an elephant, a\ndog, and a _S_ vapaka, as alike 3. Even here, those have conquered the\nmaterial world, whose mind rests in equability 4; since Brahman is free from\ndefects and equable, therefore they rest in\n\np. 66\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahman. He who knows Brahman, whose mind is steady, who\nis not deluded, and who rests in Brahman, does not exult on finding anything\nagreeable, nor does he grieve on finding anything disagreeable 1. One whose\nself is not attached to external objects, obtains the happiness that is in\n(one\'s) self; and by means of concentration of mind, joining one\'s self (with\nthe Brahman), one obtains indestructible happiness. For the enjoyments born of\ncontact (between senses and their objects) are, indeed, sources of misery;\nthey have a beginning as well as an end 2. O son of Kunti! a wise man feels no\npleasure in them. He who even in this world, before his release from the body,\nis able to bear the agitations produced from desire and wrath, is a devoted\nman, he is a happy man. The devotee whose happiness is within (himself), whose\nrecreation is within (himself), and whose light (of knowledge) also is within\n(himself), becoming (one with) the Brahman 3, obtain the Brahmic bliss 4. The\nsages whose sins have perished, whose misgivings are destroyed, who are self-\nrestrained, and who are intent on the welfare of all beings 5, obtain the\nBrahmic bliss. To the ascetics, who are free from desire and wrath 6, and\nwhose minds are restrained, and who have knowledge of the self, the Brahmic\nbliss is on both sides (of death). The sage who excludes (from his mind)\n\np. 67\n\nexternal objects, (concentrates) the visual power between the brows\n[1](sbe0808.htm#fn_232), and making the upward and downward life-breaths even,\nconfines their movements within the nose, who restrains senses, mind, and\nunderstanding [2](sbe0808.htm#fn_233), whose highest goal is final\nemancipation, from whom desire, fear, and wrath have departed, is, indeed, for\never released (from birth and death). He knowing me to be the enjoyer of all\nsacrifices and penances, the great Lord of all worlds, and the friend of all\nbeings, attains tranquillity.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[63:1](sbe0806.htm#fr_213) Sutta Nipata, p. 49.\n\n[63:2](sbe0806.htm#fr_214) Cautious, free from heedlessness.\n\n[63:3](sbe0807.htm#fr_215) I. e. one who has performed \'renunciation.\'\n\n[64:1](sbe0807.htm#fr_216) Those who follow the yoga \'path.\' The form is\nnoteworthy, grammatically.\n\n[64:2](sbe0807.htm#fr_217) I. e. \'attains true renunciation,\' says _S_ a _n_\nkara; _S_ ridhara says, \'attains Brahman, after becoming a "renouncer."\'\n\n[64:3](sbe0807.htm#fr_218) Here self is explained as body; in the line which\ngoes before it is explained as heart.\n\n[64:4](sbe0807.htm#fr_219) These are the various operations of the organs of\nperception, action, &c.\n\n[64:5](sbe0807.htm#fr_220) Excretions, &c.\n\n[64:6](sbe0807.htm#fr_221) A very common simile.
