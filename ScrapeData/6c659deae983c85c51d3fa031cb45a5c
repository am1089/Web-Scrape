(Such a previous seminal condition of the world may be admitted) on\naccount of its dependency on him (the Lord); (for such an admission is)\naccording to reason.\n\nHere a new objection is raised.--If, the opponent says, in order to prove the\npossibility of the body being called undeveloped you admit that this world in\nits antecedent seminal condition before either names or forms are evolved can\nbe called undeveloped, you virtually concede the doctrine that the pradhana is\nthe cause of the world. For we Sa _n_ khyas understand by the term pradhana\nnothing but that antecedent condition of the world.\n\nThings lie differently, we rejoin. If we admitted some antecedent state of the\nworld as the independent cause of the actual world, we should indeed\nimplicitly, admit the\n\np. 243\n\npradhana doctrine. What we admit is, however, only a previous state dependent\non the highest Lord, not an independent state. A previous stage of the world\nsuch as the one assumed by us must necessarily be admitted, since it is\naccording to sense and reason. For without it the highest Lord could not be\nconceived as creator, as he could not become active if he were destitute of\nthe potentiality of action. The existence of such a causal potentiality\nrenders it moreover possible that the released souls should not enter on new\ncourses of existence, as it is destroyed by perfect knowledge. For that causal\npotentiality is of the nature of Nescience; it is rightly denoted by the term\n'undeveloped;' it has the highest Lord for its substratum; it is of the nature\nof an illusion; it is a universal sleep in which are lying the transmigrating\nsouls destitute for the time of the consciousness of their individual\ncharacter.  1 This undeveloped principle is sometimes denoted by the term aka\n_s_ a, ether; so, for instance, in the passage, 'In that Imperishable then, O\nGargi, the ether is woven like warp and woof' (B _ri_. Up. III, 8, 11).\nSometimes, again, it is denoted by the term akshara, the Imperishable; so, for\ninstance (Mu. Up. II, 1, 2), 'Higher, than the high Imperishable.' Sometimes\nit is spoken of as Maya, illusion; so, for instance ( _S_ ve. Up. IV, 10),\n'Know then Prak _ri_ ti is Maya, and the great Lord he who is affected with\nMaya.' For Maya is properly called undeveloped or non-manifested since it\ncannot be defined either as that which is or that which is not.--The statement\nof the Ka _th_ aka that 'the Undeveloped is beyond the Great\n\np. 244\n\none' is based on the fact of the Great one originating from the Undeveloped,\nif the Great one be the intellect of Hira _n_ yagarbha. If, on the other hand,\nwe understand by the Great one the individual soul, the statement is founded\non the fact of the existence of the individual soul depending on the\nUndeveloped, i.e. Nescience. For the continued existence of the individual\nsoul as such is altogether owing to the relation in which it stands to\nNescience. The quality of being beyond the Great one which in the first place\nbelongs to the Undeveloped, i.e. Nescience, is attributed to the body which is\nthe product of Nescience, the cause and the effect being considered as\nidentical. Although the senses, &c. are no less products of Nescience, the\nterm 'the Undeveloped' here refers to the body only, the senses, &c. having\nalready been specially mentioned by their individual names, and the body alone\nbeing left.--Other interpreters of the two last Sutras give a somewhat\ndifferent explanation  1.--There are, they say, two kinds of body, the gross\none and the subtle one. The gross body is the one which is perceived; the\nnature of the subtle one will be explained later on. (Ved. Su. III, 1, 1.)\nBoth these bodies together were in the simile compared to the chariot; but\nhere (in the passage under discussion) only the subtle body is referred to as\nthe Undeveloped, since the subtle body only is capable of being denoted by\nthat term. And as the soul's passing through bondage and release depends on\nthe subtle body, the latter is said to be beyond the soul, like the things\n(arthavat), i.e. just as the objects are said to be beyond the senses because\nthe activity of the latter depends on the objects.--But how--we ask\ninterpreters--is it possible that the word 'Undeveloped' should refer to the\nsubtle body only, while, according to your opinion, both bodies had in the\nsimile been represented as a chariot, and so equally constitute part of the\ntopic of the chapter, and equally remain (to be mentioned in the\n\np. 245\n\npassage under discussion)?--If you should rejoin that you are authorised to\nsettle the meaning of what the text actually mentions, but not to find fault\nwith what is not mentioned, and that the word avyakta which occurs in the text\ncan denote only the subtle body, but not the gross body which is vyakta, i.e.\ndeveloped or manifest; we invalidate this rejoinder by remarking that the\ndetermination of the sense depends on the circumstance of the passages\ninterpreted constituting a syntactical whole. For if the earlier and the later\npassage do not form a whole they convey no sense, since that involves the\nabandonment of the subject started and the taking up of a new subject. But\nsyntactical unity cannot be established unless it be on the ground of there\nbeing a want of a complementary part of speech or sentence. If you therefore\nconstrue the connexion of the passages without having regard to the fact that\nthe latter passage demands as its complement that both bodies (which had been\nspoken of in the former passage) should be understood as referred to, you\ndestroy all syntactical unity and so incapacitate yourselves from arriving at\nthe true meaning of the text. Nor must you think that the second passage\noccupies itself with the subtle body only, for that reason that the latter is\nnot easily distinguished from the Self, while the gross body is easily so\ndistinguished on account of its readily perceived loathsomeness. For the\npassage does not by any means refer to such a distinction--as we conclude from\nthe circumstance of there being no verb enjoining it--but has for its only\nsubject the highest place of Vish _n_ u, which had been mentioned immediately\nbefore. For after having enumerated a series of things in which the subsequent\none is always superior to the one preceding it, it concludes by saying that\nnothing is beyond the Person.--We might, however, accept the interpretation\njust discussed without damaging our general argumentation; for whichever\nexplanation we receive, so much remains clear that the Ka _th_ aka passage\ndoes not refer to the pradhana.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[243:1](sbe34114.htm#fr_234) Nanu na bi _g_ a _s_ aktir vidyaya dahyate\nvastutvad atmavan nety aha avidyeti.
