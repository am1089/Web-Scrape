Now the graha 2, forsooth, is he that burns yonder, since by him\nall these creatures are held (swayed). Hence they say, 'We take (grab) the\ngrahas,' 'They walk, seized by the grahas.'\n\n4:6:5:22\\. The graha, forsooth, is Va _k_ (speech); for by speech everything\nis swayed (grab) here 3,--what wonder, then 4, that Va _k_ is the graha?\n\n4:6:5:33\\. The graha, forsooth, is the name, for everything is held (fixed) by\na name here,--what wonder, then, that the name is the graha? We know the names\nof many, and are they not thereby held by us 5?\n\np. 433\n\n4:6:5:44\\. The graha, forsooth, is food; for by food everything is kept (grah)\nhere: hence as many as eat our food, all those are kept by us. Such is the\nnatural order of things.\n\n4:6:5:55\\. And as to this graha of Soma, that is food; for whatever deity one\ndraws this graha, that deity, being seized by this graha, fulfils that wish of\nhis for which he draws it. He approaches either the rising or the setting sun,\nthinking, 'Thou art the seizer, seize thou N.N. by such and such a disease!\nmay N.N. not obtain such and such!' (naming) him whom he hates; or with, 'May\nsuch and such a wish not be fulfilled to him!' and, assuredly, that wish is\nnot fulfilled to him for whom he thus approaches (the sun).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[432:2](sbe2674.htm#fr_1008) That is, the seizer, holder, swayer. According to\nthe St. Petersb. Dict. the word 'graha' probably has not already in this\npassage the later meaning of 'planet' as the one holding or influencing man;\nbut that of some demoniac being. The whole Brahma _n_ a is a play on the word\n'graha' in its active and passive meanings of seizer, holder, influence; and\ndraught, libation. The corresponding Brahma _n_ a of the Ka _n_ va text (V, 7,\n1) differs widely from our text. Its general drift is as follows: The graha is\nthe breath,--the graha of that breath is food,--the graha of that food is the\nwater,--the graha of that water is fire,--the graha of the fire (Agni) is the\nbreath,--thus the deities are seized by him, and he wins a place in the world\nof the deities.\n\n[432:3](sbe2674.htm#fr_1009) Perhaps with the double-entendre, 'everything\n(libation &c.) is drawn with speech here.'\n\n[432:4](sbe2674.htm#fr_1010) ? Kimu tad yad vag graha _h_. The usual meaning\nof kim u, 'how much more,' 'still more so,' seems hardly to suit this passage.\n\n[432:5](sbe2674.htm#fr_1011) ? Or, 'are not those of us (that have a name)\nheld (known) thereby?' In either case, however, the interrogative force of\n'atha,' without any other particle, is rather unusual.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 6, 6. Sixth Brahma _n_ a](sbe2675.htm)\n\n"
