Dharmarajan said :-- Those that are in Hari\xc2\x92s service, pure, the Siddhas\nin Yoga (those that have attained success in Yoga), the performers of Vratas\n(vows), the chaste, the ascetics, the Brahmacharis never go to hells. There is\nno doubt in this. Those persons that are proud of their strong positions and\nwho use very harsh burning words to their friends, they go to Vah _n_ i Ku\n_nd_ a and live there for as many years as there are hairs on his body; next\nthey attain animal births for three births and get themselves scorched under\nthe strong heat of the Sun. He goes to the Tapta Ku _nd_ a hell who does not\n\n\n\np. 928\n\n\n\nentertain any Brahma _n_ guest with any eatables who comes to his house hungry\nand thirsty. He lives there for as many years as there are hairs on his body\nand he has to sleep on a bed of fire, very tormenting. Then he will have to be\nborn for seven births as birds. If anybody washes any clothing with any salt\non Sunday, or on the day of Samkranti (when the Sun enters another sign), or\non any new-moon day or on any S\xc2\x92raddha day (when funeral ceremonies are\nperformed), he will have to go to the K _s_ ara Ku _nd_ a hell where he\nremains for as many years as there are threads in that clothing and finally he\nbecomes born for seven births as a veritable washerman. The wretch that abuses\nMula Prakriti, the Vedas, the S\xc2\x92astras, Pura _n_ as, Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, S\xc2\x92iva\nand the other Devas, Gauri, Lak _s_ mi, Sarasvati and the other Devis, goes to\nthe hell named Bhayanaka Narakaku _nd_ a. There is no other hell more\ntormenting than this. The sinners live here for many Kalpas and ultimately\nbecome serpents. There is no sin greater than the abuse of the Devi. There is\nno expiation for it. So one ought never to abuse the Devi. If one discontinues\nthe allowances given by oneself or other persons to the Devas or Brahma _n_\nas, one goes to Vi _st_ ha Ku _nd_ a and has to eat the faeces there for sixty\nthousand years and finally to be born in Bharata as worms in faeces the same\nnumber of years. If any person without the owner\xc2\x92s permission digs another\xc2\x92s\ntank dried of water, or makes water in the water of any tank, he goes to Mutra\nKu _nd_ a and drinks urine for as many years as there are the particles in\nthat tank. Then he becomes born in this Bharata its an ox for one hundred\nyears. If any person eats good things himself without giving any portion\nthereof to the member of his family, he goes to S\xc2\x92le _s_ ma Ku _nd_ a where he\neats phlegm, for full one hundred years. Then he becomes born as Preta\n(disembodied spirits) in this Bharata for hundred years and drinks phlegm,\nurine and pus; then he becomes pure. He who does not support his father,\nmother, spiritual teacher, wife, sons, daughters and the helpless persons,\ngoes to Gara Ku _nd_ a where he eats poison for full one hundred years.\nFinally he becomes born and wanders as Bhutas (disembodied spirits). Then he\nbecomes pure.\n\n\n\n20-50. He who becomes angry and shrinks his eyes at the sight of a guest who\nhas come to his house offends the Devas or Pitris, who do not accept the water\noffered to them by that villain. On the contrary, he earns all the sins of\nBrahmahatya (murder of a Brahmi _n_ and so forth) and finally goes to Du _s_\nikaku _nd_ a where he remains for one hundred years and eats polluted things.\nThen wandering as Bhutas for one hundred years he becomes purified. If anybody\nmakes a gift of any article to a Brahmi _n_ and then again gives that article\nto a different man, he goes to Vasa Kun _da_\n\n_ _\n\np. 929\n\n\n\nwhere he eats marrows for one hundred years. Then he has to roam about in\nIndia for seven births as a Krikalasa (lizard) and finally he becomes born as\na very poor man with a very short life. If any woman or any man makes another\nof a different sex eat semen, out of passion, he goes to S\xc2\x92ukra Ku _nd_ a\nwhere he drinks semen for one hundred years. Then he crawls about as worms for\none hundred years. And then he gets purified. If anybody beats a Brahma _n_ a\nwho is a family preceptor and causes his blood to come out, he will have to go\nto Rakta Ku _nd_ a where he has to drink blood for one hundred years. Finally\nhe has to roam about for seven births in India as tigers; then he becomes pure\nby degrees. If anybody mocks and laughs at any devotee of Kri _sn_ a who sings\nwith rapt consciousness and sheds tears of joy, he will have to go to As\xc2\x92ru Ku\n_nd_ a where he drinks tears for one hundred years. Then he has to roam as Cha\n_nd_ ala for three births and then he becomes pure. He who always cheats his\nfriends, lives for one hundred years in Gatramala Ku _nd_ a. Then roaming\nabout for three births as an ass and for three births as a fox concurrently,\nhe becomes purified. Out of vanity, if anybody jests at a deaf person, he goes\nto Kar _n_ amalaku _nd_ a where he eats for one hundred years the wax of the\near. Next he comes to the earth as a deaf and very poor man for seven births,\nwhen at last he gets purified. If anybody commits murder out of greed to\nsupport his family, he goes to the hell Majjaku _nd_ a where he eats marrow\nfor one lakh years. Next he becomes a fish for seven births, for seven births\nhe becomes a mosquito, for three births he becomes a boar, for seven births he\nbecomes a cock, deer and other animals concurrently; at last he gets purified.\nIf any stupid person sells the daughter whom he has supported, out of greed\nfor money, he goes to Ma _n_ saku _nd_ a and lives there for as many years as\nthere are hairs on her body. The Yama\xc2\x92s servants beat him with their clubs.\nHis head becomes overloaded with the burden of the flesh; and, out of hunger,\nhe licks the blood coming out of his head. Next that sinner comes to Bharata\nand for sixty years becomes a worm in any daughter\xc2\x92s faeces, for seven births\nhe becomes a hunter; for three births, a boar; for seven births, cock; for\nseven births, frog; for seven births, leech; and for seven births, crow; when\nhe gets purified. One who shaves on the day of observing vows, fasting and\nfuneral ceremony day, becomes impure and unfit to do any action, and, in the\nend, he goes to the Nakha Ku _nd_ a where he receives blows of clubs and eats\nnails for one hundred Deva years. If anybody worships, out of carelessness,\nthe earthen S\xc2\x92iva phallic symbol with any hairs on it, he goes to the hell\nKes\xc2\x92a Ku _nd_ a where he remains for as many years as there are particles in\nthat hair; then he gets to the yoni (womb) a Yavanani (a Mlechcha woman) out\nof Hara\xc2\x92s wrath. After one hundred\n\n\n\np. 930\n\n\n\nyears he becomes freed from that and then he becomes a Rak _s_ asa; there is\nno doubt in this. He who does not offer Pi _nd_ as to the Vi _sn_ upada in\nhonour of his Pitris at Gaya goes to the hell Asthiku _nd_ a where he remains\nfor as many years as there are dirts on his body. Then he becomes a man; but\nfor seven births he becomes lame and poor. Then he gets purified. The stupid\nman who commits outrage and violence on his pregnant wife, resides for one\nhundred years in the hot Tamra Ku _nd_ a (where coppers are in a molten\ncondition). He who takes the food of a childless widow and the same of any\nwoman that has just bathed after menstruation goes for one hundred years to\nthe hot Lauha Ku _nd_ a (where iron is in a molten condition). For seven\nbirths he becomes then a crow and for seven births he becomes born of a\nwasherwoman, full of sores and boils, and poor. Then he gets purified.\n\n\n\n51-61. If one touches the things of the Devas after touching skins or impure\nhides, one remains in the Charma Ku _nd_ a for full one hundred years. If any\nBrahmi _n_ eats a S\xc2\x92udra\xc2\x92s food, requested by him, he lives for one hundred\nyears in the hot Sura Ku _nd_ a. Then for seven births he performs, the\nfuneral rites for a S\xc2\x92udra; at last he becomes pure. If any foul-mouthed\nperson uses always harsh and filthy language to his master, he will have to go\nto Tik _sn_ a Kan _t_ aka Ku _nd_ a where he eats thorns. Besides, the Yama\xc2\x92s\nservants give severe beatings to him with their clubs. For seven births he\nwill have to become horses when he gets purified. If any man ministers poison\nto another and so takes away his life, he will have to remain for endless\nyears in Vi _s_ aku _nd_ a, where he will have to eat poison. Then he will\nhave to pass for one hundred years as a murderer Bhilla, full of sores and\nboils, and for seven births he will have to be a leper when at last he gets\npurified. Being born in this holy land Bharatavar _s_ a, if any man strikes a\ncow with a rod or any driver does so whether by himself or by his servant, he\nwill have to dwell certainly in the hot Lauha Ku _nd_ a for four yugas. He\nwill have to pass as many years as a cow as there are hairs on that cow when\nultimately he gets purified. If anybody strikes any other body with a red-hot\niron dart (Kunta weapon), he will have to dwell in the Kunta Ku _nd_ a for\nayuta years. Then he will have to remain for one birth in a good womb, with a\ndiseased constitution, when ultimately he will be purified.\n\n\n\n62-85. If any Brahmi _n_ villain eats, out of greed, any flesh (not sacrificed\nbefore the goddess) or anything not offered to Hari, he will have to remain in\nthe Krimi Ku _nd_ a where he eats those things for as many years as there are\nhairs on his body. Then he will have to pass for three births as Mlechchas\nwhen ultimately he becomes born in a Brahmi _n_\n\n\n\np. 931\n\n\n\nfamily. If any Brahmi _n_ performs the S\xc2\x92radh of a S\xc2\x92udra, eats the food\npertaining to a S\xc2\x92radh of a S\xc2\x92udra or burns the dead body of a S\xc2\x92udra, he will\nhave to dwell certainly in Puya Ku _nd_ a, where, being beaten by the rod of\nYama, he eats the pus, etc., for as many years as there are hairs on his body.\nThen he becomes reborn in this Bharata as one greatly diseased, poor, deaf and\ndumb and ultimately he will have to roam for seven births as a S\xc2\x92udra. He who\nkills a black serpent on whose hood there is the lotus mark, lives in Sarpa Ku\n_nd_ a for as many years as there are hairs on his body and he is bitten by\nserpents there and beaten by the servants of Yama and eats the excrescences of\nsnakes and finally becomes born as a serpent. Then he becomes a man shortlived\nand having the cuticaneous disease and ringworm. And his death also comes out\nof snake-bite. He who kills mosquitoes and other small fanged-animals, that\nearn their substance rightly and pass so their lives, goes to Dams\xc2\x92a mas\xc2\x92a Ku\n_nd_ a where he is eaten by mosquitoes and other fanged-creatures and lives\nthere without food and crying, weeping, for as many years as the numbers of\nlives destroyed. Besides the Yama\xc2\x92s servants tie his hands and feet and beat\nhim. Then he becomes born as flies when ultimately he becomes purified. He who\nbeats and chastises any man not fit to be chastised and beaten and as well as\na Brahma _n_ a, goes to Vajra Dam _st_ ra Ku _nd_ a, full of worms, and lives\nthere day and night for as many years as there are the number of hairs on the\nchastised person. When he is bitten by the worms and beaten by Yama\xc2\x92s\nservants, he cries sometimes, weeps sometimes, and becomes very miserable.\nNext he is reborn as a crow for seven births when ultimately he gets purified.\nIf any foolish king punishes and gives trouble to his subjects out of greed of\nmoney, he goes to Vri _s_ chika Ku _nd_ a where he lives for as many years as\nthere are hairs on the bodies of his subjects. There is no doubt in this.\nFinally he becomes born in this Bharata as a scorpion; then a man diseased and\ndefective in limbs, when ultimately he becomes freed of his sins. If any\nBrahmi _n_ carries or raises weapons, washes the clothes of others who do not\nperform Sandhyas and abandons his devotion to Hari, he lives in Saradi Ku _nd_\na for as many years as there are hairs on his body; he is, then, pierced by\narrows. Finally he becomes purified. If any king maddened by his own folly and\nfault, shuts his subjects in a dark cell and kills them, then he will have to\ngo to a dreadful dark hell filled with worms having fanged teeth and covered\nwith dirt. This hell is named Gola Ku _nd_ a. He lives there bitten by insects\nfor as many years as there are hairs on the bodies of his subjects. Finally he\nbecomes a slave of those subjects, when he gets purified.\n\n\n\n86-103. If anybody kills the sharks and crocodiles, etc., that rise out of the\nwater spontaneously, he will have to remain, then, in Nakra\n\n\n\np. 932\n\n\n\nKu _nd_ a for as many years as there are thorns or edged points on those\nanimals. Then he will have to be born as crocodiles, etc., for some time, when\nhe will be purified. If any man, overpowered with lust, sees another\xc2\x92s wife\xc2\x92s\nuncovered breast, loins, and face, he will have to remain in Kaka Ku _nd_ a\nfor as many years as there are hairs in his own body. Here the crows take out\nhis eyes. Finally for three births he gets himself burned by Fire when he\nbecomes pure. He who steals in India the gold of the Devas and the Brahma _n_\nas, dwells certainly in Manthana Ku _nd_ a for as many years as there are\nhairs on his body. My servants give him good beatings, and cudgellings; his\neyes are covered by Manthana Danda insects (or animals) and he eats their\ndirty faeces. Then he is reborn as a man but for three births he becomes blind\nand for seven births he becomes very poor, cruel, and a sinful goldsmith and\nthen he is born a Svar _n_ ava _n_ ik (Sonar bene). O Fair One! He who steals\nin India copper or iron, silver or gold, dwells in Vija Ku _nd_ a for as many\nyears as there are hairs on his body. There the Vijas (a kind of insect) cover\nhis eyes and he eats the excrescences of those insects. My messengers torment\nhim. Finally he gets purified. If anybody steals in India any Devata or the\narticles of a Devata, he dwells in Vajra Ku _nd_ a for as many years as there\nare hairs on his body. There his body gets burnt up. My messengers torment him\nand he a cries and weeps and remains without any food. Then he gets purified.\nIf anybody steals the metal gold or silver, cows, or garments of any Deva or a\nBrahma _n_ a, certainly he dwells in hot Pa _s_ a _n_ a Ku _nd_ a for as many\nyears as there are hairs on his body. Next for three births he becomes a\ntortoise and all sorts of white birds. Finally for three births he becomes a\nleper and for one birth be becomes a man with white marks on his body. Next\nfor seven births he becomes diseased with a severe colic pain and bad blood\nand lives short. Then he gets purified. If anybody steals brass or Kamsya\nproperties of any Deva or a Brahma _n_ a, he will have to remain in the sharp\nPa _s_ a _n_ a Ku _nd_ a for as many years as there are hairs on his body.\nNext he becomes born in Bharata for seven births as horses; and ultimately his\nboth the testicles get enlarged and he gets diseases in his legs when he gets\npurified. If anybody verily eats the food of an adulterate woman or lives on\nher alms, he will have to go to the Lala Ku _nd_ a for as many years as there\nare hairs on his body. My messengers torment him there and he eats the saliva\nand thus lives miserably. Then he gets eye diseases and colic; when ultimately\nhe gets purified.\n\n\n\n104-126. If any Brahma _n_ a lives on writing only or on the service of\nMlechchas, he lives in Masi Ku _nd_ a very painfully, eating ink, tormented by\nMy messengers for as many years as there are hairs\n\n\n\np. 933\n\n\n\non his body. Then he becomes a black animal for three births and for another\nthree births he becomes a black goat. Then he becomes a Tal tree when he gets\npurified. If anybody steals a Deva\xc2\x92s or\n\na Brahma _n_ a\xc2\x92s grains, or any other good materials, betel, \xc3\x82san (seat) or\nbedding, he lives in Chur _n_ a Ku _nd_ a for one hundred years, tormented by\nMy Dutas (messengers). Next for three births he gets\n\nhimself born as a goat, cock, and monkey. Finally he becomes born as a man\nwith the heart disease, without any issue, poor, and short lived. When, at\nlast, he gets purified. If anybody steals any Brahmi _n \xc2\x92_s property and\nthereby does chakra puja (the famous chakra circle worship in Tantra), or\nprepares a potter\xc2\x92s wheel or any other wheels, he will have to go to Chakra Ku\n_nd_ a and remain there for one hundred years, tormented by My messengers.\nThen he will be born for three births as an oilman suffering from very severe\ndiseases when he will ultimately be poor, without any issue and diseased.\nFinally he gets purified. If anybody casts a sinful eye on any Brahma _n_ a or\non cows, he will have to remain in Vakra Ku _nd_ a for one hundred Yugas. Next\nfor three births he becomes a cat, for three births he becomes a vulture; for\nthree births he becomes a boar; for three births he becomes a peacock; for\nseven births he becomes a man deformed and defective in limbs, his wife being\ndead, without any issue. Finally he becomes purified. If any person born in a\nBrahmi _n_ family eats the flesh of a tortoise that is prohibited, he lives in\nKurma Ku _nd_ a, for one hundred years, eaten by tortoises. Then he becomes\nfor three births a tortoise; for three births, a boar; for three births a cat;\nfor three births, a peacock; till at last he gets purified. If anybody steals\nclarified butter or oil of any Devas or a Brahma _n_ a he will have to go to\nJvala Ku _nd_ a or Bha _s_ ma Ku _nd_ a. That sinner remains in oil for one\nhundred years and gets soaked through and through. Then for seven births he\nbecomes a fish and a mouse when he gets purified. If anybody, born here in\nthis holy land Bharata steals sweet scented oil of a Deva or of a Brahma _n_\na, the powdered myrobalan or any other scent, he goes to Dagdha Ku _nd_ a\nwhere he lives, burnt day and night for as many years as there are hairs on\nhis body. For seven births he becomes born emitting a nasty smell, for three\nbirths he becomes musk (mriga-nabhi); for seven births, as a Manthana insect.\nThen he becomes born as a man. If, out of envy, a powerful man appropriates to\nhis purpose another\xc2\x92s ancestral property by cheating, by using force, he goes\nto the hot Suchi Ku _nd_ a, being tormented there like a Jiva dropped in the\nmidst of a very hot oil tank, full of boiling oil. His body is, then, being\nburnt up severely as the\n\n\n\np. 934\n\n\n\nresult of his own Karma; the wonder being that his body never gets completely\ndestroyed nor reduced to ashes. For seven manvantaras he lives there without\nany food. My messengers give him good beatings and cudgellings and chastise\nhim; he cries aloud. Next he gets himself born as worms of faeces for sixty\nthousand years. When he becomes born as a pauper without owning any land. Thus\nthat villain, getting a fresh lease of human birth, begins again to do fresh\ngood acts.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Thirty-third Chapter of the Ninth Book on the description of the\ndestinies of different sinners in different hells in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam\nof 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 34](bk09ch34.htm)\n\n'
