And of three only there is this mention and question.\n\nIn the Upanishad under discussion there is mention\n\np. 361\n\nmade of three things only as objects of knowledge--the three standing to one\nanother in the relation of means, end to be realised by those means, and\npersons realising,--and questions are asked as to those three only. There is\nno mention of, nor question referring to, the Unevolved.--Na _k_ iketas\ndesirous of Release having been allowed by Death to choose three boons,\nchooses for his first boon that his father should be well disposed towards him\n--without which he could not hope for spiritual welfare. For his second boon\nhe chooses the knowledge of the Na _k_ iketa-fire, which is a means towards\nfinal Release. 'Thou knowest, O Death, the fire-sacrifice which leads to\nheaven; tell it to me, full of faith. Those who live in the heaven-world reach\nImmortality--this I ask as my second boon.' The term 'heaven-world' here\ndenotes the highest aim of man, i.e. Release, as appears from the declaration\nthat those who live there enjoy freedom from old age and death; from the fact\nthat further on (I, 1, 26) works leading to perishable results are disparaged;\nand from what Yama says in reply to the second demand 'He who thrice performs\nthis Na _k_ iketa-rite overcomes birth and death.' As his third boon he, in\nthe form of a question referring to final release, actually enquires about\nthree things, viz. 'the nature of the end to be reached, i.e. Release; the\nnature of him who wishes to reach that end; and the nature of the means to\nreach it, i.e. of meditation assisted by certain works. Yama, having tested Na\n_k_ iketas' fitness to receive the desired instruction, thereupon begins to\nteach him. 'The Ancient who is difficult to be seen, who has entered inLo the\ndark, who is hidden in the cave, who dwells in the abyss; having known him as\nGod, by means of meditation on his Self, the wise one leaves joy and sorrow\nbehind.' Here the clause 'having known the God,' points to the divine Being\nthat is to be meditated upon; the clause 'by means of meditation on his Self\npoints to the attaining agent, i.e. the individual soul as an object of\nknowledge; and the clause 'having known him the wise ones leave joy and sorrow\nbehind' points to the meditation through which Brahman is to be reached. Na\n_k_ iketas, pleased with the\n\np. 362\n\ngeneral instruction received, questions again in order to receive clearer\ninformation on those three matters, 'What thou seest as different from dharma\nand different from adharma, as different from that, from that which is done\nand not done, as different from what is past or future, tell me that'; a\nquestion referring to three things, viz. an object to be effected, a means to\neffect it, and an effecting agent--each of which is to be different from\nanything else past, present, or future 1. Yama thereupon at first instructs\nhim as to the Pra _n_ ava, 'That word which all the Vedas record, which all\npenances proclaim, desiring which men become religious students; that word I\ntell thee briefly--it is Om'--an instruction which implies praise of the Pra\n_n_ ava, and in a general way sets forth that which the Pra _n_ ava expresses,\ne.g. the nature of the object to be reached, the nature of the person reaching\nit, and the means for reaching it, such means here consisting in the word\n'Om,' which denotes the object to be reached 2. He then continues to glorify\nthe Pra _n_ ava (I, a, 16-17), and thereupon gives special information in the\nfirst place about the nature of the attaining subject, i.e, the individual\nsoul, 'The knowing Self is not born, it dies not,' &c. Next he teaches Na _k_\niketas as to the true nature of the object to be attained, viz. the highest\nBrahman or Vish _n_ u, in the section beginning 'The Self smaller than small,'\nand ending 'Who then knows where he is?' (I, 2, 20-25). Part of this section,\nviz. 'That Self cannot be gained by the Veda,' &c.,\n\np. 363\n\nat the same time teaches that the meditation through which Brahman is attained\nis of the nature of devotion (bhakti). Next the _s_ loka I, 3, 1 'There are\nthe two drinking their reward' shows that, as the object of devout meditation\nand the devotee abide together, meditation is easily performed. Then the\nsection beginning 'Know the Self to be him who drives in the chariot,' and\nending 'the wise say the path is hard' (I, 3, 3-14), teaches the true mode of\nmeditation, and how the devotee reaches the highest abode of Vish _n_ u; and\nthen there is a final reference to the object to be reached in I, 3,15, 'That\nwhich is without sound, without touch,' &c. It thus appears that there are\nreferences and questions regarding those three matters only; and hence the\n'Un-evolved' cannot mean the Pradhana of the Sa _n_ khyas.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[362:1](sbe48148.htm#fr_31) The commentary proposes different ways of finding\nthose three objects of enquiry in the words of Na _k_ iketas. According to the\nfirst explanation, 'that which is different fronm dharma' is a means differing\nfrom all ordinary means; 'adharma' 'not-dharma' is what is not a means, but\nthe result to be reached: hence 'that which is different from adharma' is a\nresult diferring from all ordinary results. 'What is different from that' is\nan agent different from 'that'; i.e. an ordinary agent, and so on. ( _S_ ru.\nPraka _s_. p. 1226.)\n\n[362:2](sbe48148.htm#fr_32) The syllable 'Om,' which denotes Brahman, is a\nmeans towards meditation (Brahman being meditated upon under this form), and\nthus indirectly a means towards reaching Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 7.
