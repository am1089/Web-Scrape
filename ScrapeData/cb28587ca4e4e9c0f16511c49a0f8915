Also (beings) above them, (viz. men) (are qualified for the study and\npractice of the Veda), on account of the possibility (of it), according to\nBadaraya _n_ a.\n\nIt has been said above that the passage about him who is of the size of a\nthumb has reference to the human heart, because men are entitled to study and\nact according to the _s_ astra. This gives us an occasion for the following\ndiscussion.--It is true that the _s_ astra entitles men, but, at the same\ntime, there is no exclusive rule entitling men only to the knowledge of\nBrahman; the teacher, Badaraya _n_ a, rather thinks that the _s_ astra\nentitles those (classes of beings) also which are above men, viz. gods, and so\non.--On what account?--On the account of possibility.--For in their cases also\nthe different causes on which the qualification depends, such as having\ncertain desires, and so on, may exist. In the first place, the gods also may\nhave the desire of final release, caused by the reflection that all effects,\nobjects, and powers are non-permanent. In the second place, they may be\ncapable of it as their corporeality appears from mantras, arthavadas,\nitihasas, pura _n_ as, and ordinary experience. In the third place, there is\nno prohibition (excluding them like _S_ udras). Nor does, in the fourth place,\nthe scriptural rule about the upanayana-ceremony annul their title; for that\n\np. 199\n\nceremony merely subserves the study of the Veda, and to the gods the Veda is\nmanifest of itself (without study). That the gods, moreover, for the purpose\nof acquiring knowledge, undergo discipleship, and the like, appears from such\nscriptural passages as \'One hundred and one years Indra lived as a disciple\nwith Pra _g_ apati\' ( _Kh._ Up. VIII, ii, 3), and \'Bh _ri_ gu Varu _n_ i went\nto his father Varu _n_ a, saying, "Sir, teach me Brahman"\' (Taitt. Up. III,\n1).--And the reasons which have been given above against gods and _ri_ shis\nbeing entitled to perform religious works (such as sacrifices), viz. the\ncircumstance of there being no other gods (to whom the gods could offer\nsacrifices), and of there being no other _ri_ shis (who could be invoked\nduring the sacrifice), do not apply to the case of branches of knowledge. For\nIndra and the other gods, when applying themselves to knowledge, have no acts\nto perform with a view to Indra, and so on; nor have Bh _ri_ gu and other _ri_\nshis, in the same case, to do anything with the circumstance of their\nbelonging to the same gotra as Bh _ri_ gu, &c. What, then, should stand in the\nway of the gods\' and _ri_ shis\' right to acquire knowledge?--Moreover, the\npassage about that which is of the size of a thumb remains equally valid, if\nthe right of the gods, &c. is admitted; it has then only to be explained in\neach particular case by a reference to the particular size of the thumb (of\nthe class of beings spoken of).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 27](sbe34096.htm)\n\n'
