'Man (purusha), my son, consists of sixteen parts. Abstain from food for\nfifteen days, but drink as much water as you like, for breath comes from\nwater, and will not be cut off, if you drink water.'\n\n2\\. _S_ vetaketu abstained from food for fifteen days. Then he came to his\nfather and said: 'What shall I say?' The father said: 'Repeat the _Ri_ _k_ ,\nYa _g_ us, and Saman verses.' He replied: 'They do not occur to me, Sir.'\n\n3\\. The father said to him: 'As of a great lighted fire one coal only of the\nsize of a firefly may be left, which would not burn much more than this (i. e.\nvery\n\np. 98\n\nlittle), thus, my dear son, one part only of the sixteen parts (of you) is\nleft, and therefore with that one part you do not remember the Vedas. Go and\neat!\n\n4\\. 'Then wilt thou understand me.' Then _S_ vetaketu. ate, and afterwards\napproached his father. And whatever his father asked him, he knew it all by\nheart.

'Thus, my dear son, there was one part of the sixteen parts left to you,\nand that, lighted up with food, burnt up, and by it you remember now the\nVedas.' After that, he understood what his father meant when he said: 'Mind,\nmy son, comes from food, breath from water, speech from fire.' He understood\nwhat he said, yea, he understood it 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[98:1](sbe01125.htm#fr_283) The repetition shows that the teaching of the Triv\n_ri_ kara _n_ a, the tripartite nature of things, is ended.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 8](sbe01126.htm)\n\n"
