O chief. I recognize.  \nO, while these ears can hear thee, say,  \nHas Hanuman survived this day?'  \n   'Why ask,' Vibhishan cried,' for one  \nOf lower rank, the Wind-God's son?  \nHast thou forgotten, first in place,  \nThe princely chief of Raghu's race?  \nCan King Sugriva claim no care,  \nAnd Angad, his imperial heir?'  \n   'Yea, dearer than my noblest friends  \nIs he on whom our hope depends.  \nFor if the Wind-God's son survive,  \nAll we though dead are yet alive.  \nBut if his precious life be fled  \nThough living still we are but dead:  \nHe is our hope and sure relief.'  \nThus slowly spoke the aged chief:  \nThen to his side Hanuman came,  \nAnd with low reverence named his name.  \n\nCheered by the face he longed to view  \nThe wounded chieftain lived anew.  \n'Go forth,' he cried, 'O strong and brave,  \nAnd in their woe the Vanars save.  \n'No might but thine, supremely great,  \nMay help us in our lost estate,  \nThe trembling bears and Vanars cheer,  \nCalm their sad hearts, dispel their fear.  \nSave Raghu's noble sons, and heal  \nThe deep wounds of the winged steel.  \nHigh o'er the waters of the sea  \nTo far Himalaya's summits flee.  \nKailasa there wilt thou behold,  \nAud Rishabh, with his peaks of gold.  \nBetween them see a mountain rise  \nWhose splendour will enchant thine eyes;  \nHis sides are clothed above, below,  \nWith all the rarest herbs that grow.  \nUpon that mountain's lofty crest  \nFour plants, of sovereign powers possessed,  \nSpring from the soil, and flashing there  \nShed radiance through the neighbouring air.  \nOne draws the shaft: one brings again  \nThe breath of life to warm the slain;  \nOne heals each wound; one gives anew  \nTo faded cheeks their wonted hue.  \nFly, chieftain, to that mountain's brow  \nAnd bring those herbs to save us now.'  \n   Hanuman heard, and springing through  \nThe air like Vishnu's discus  1b flew.  \nThe sea was passed: beneath him, gay  \nWith bright-winged birds, the mountains lay,  \nAnd brook and lake and lonely glen,  \nAnd fertile lands with toiling men.  \nOn, on he sped: before him rose  \nThe mansion of perennial snows.  \nThere soared the glorious peaks as fair  \nAs white clouds in the summer air.  \nHere, bursting from the leafy shade,  \nIn thunder leapt the wild cascade.  \nHe looked on many a pure retreat  \nDear to the Gods' and sages' feet:  \nThe spot where Brahma dwells apart,  \nThe place whence Rudra launched his dart;  2b  \nVishnu's high seat and Indra's home,  \nAnd slopes where Yama's servants roam.  \nThere was Kuvera's bright abode;  \nThere Brahma's mystic weapon glowed.  \nThere was the noble hill whereon  \n\np. 486  \n\nThose herbs with wondrous lustre shone.  \nAnd, ravished by the glorious sight,  \nHanuman rested on the height.  \nHe, moving down the glittering peak,  \nThe healing herbs began to seek:  \nBut, when he thought to seize the prize,  \nThey hid them from his eager eyes.  \nThen to the hill in wrath he spake:  \n'Mine arm this day shall vengeance take,  \nIf thou wilt feel no pity, none,  \nIn this great need of Raghu's son.'  \nHe ceased: his mighty arms he bent  \nAnd from the trembling mountain rent  \nHis huge head with the life it bore,  \nSnakes, elephants, and golden ore.  \nO'er hill and plain and watery waste  \nHis rapid way again he traced.  \nAnd mid the wondering Vanars laid  \nHis burthen through the air conveyed.  \nThe wondrous herbs' delightful scent  \nTo all the host new vigour lent.  \nFree from all darts and wounds and pain  \nThe sons of Raghu lived again,  \nAnd dead and dying Vanars healed  \nRose vigorous from the battle field.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[485:1](ry470.htm#fr_1007) In such cases as this I am not careful to reproduce\nthe numbers of the poet, which in the text which I follow are 670,000,000; the\nBengal recension being content with thirty million less.\n\n[485:1b](ry470.htm#fr_1008) The discus or quoit, a sharp-edged circular\nmissile is the favourite weapon of Vishnu.\n\n[485:2b](ry470.htm#fr_1009) To destroy Tripura the triple city in the sky, air\nand earth, built by Maya for a celebrated Asur or demon, or as another\ncommentator explains, to destroy Randarpa or Love.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXXV.: The Night Attack.](ry471.htm)\n\n"
