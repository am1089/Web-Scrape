 \n\'In me, dear sons, the friend behold  \nYour royal father loved of old.\'  \n   He spoke: nor long did Rama wait  \nHis sire\'s dear friend to venerate:  \n\nHe bade the bird declare his name  \nAnd the high race of which he came.  \nWhen Raghu\'s son had spoken, he  \nDeclared his name and pedigree,  \nHis words prolonging to disclose  \nHow all the things that be arose:  \n   \'List while I tell, O Raghu\'s son,  \nThe first-born Fathers, one by one,  \nGreat Lords of Life, whence all in earth  \nAnd all in heaven derive their birth.  \nFirst Kardam heads the glorious race  \nWhere Vikrit holds the second place,  \nWith S\'esha, Sans\'ray next in line,  \nAnd Bahuputra\'s might divine.  \nThen Sthanu and Marichi came,  \nAtri, and Kratu\'s forceful frame.  \nPulastya followed, next to him  \nAngiras\' name shall ne\'er be dim.  \nPrachetas, Pulah next, and then  \nDaksha, Vivasvat praised of men:  \nArishtanemi next, and last  \nKas\'yap in glory unsurpassed.  \nFrom Daksha,--fame the tale has told--  \nThree-score bright daughters sprang of old.  \nOf these fair-waisted nymphs the great  \nLord Kas\'yap sought and wedded eight,  \nAditi, Diti, Kalaka,  \nTamra, Danu, and Anala,  \nAnd Krodhavasa swift to ire,  \nAnd Manu  1b glorious as her sire.  \nThen when the mighty Kas\'yap cried  \nDelighted to each tender bride:  \n\'Sons shalt thou bear, to rule the three  \nGreat worlds, in might resembling me,\'  \n\np. 246  \n\nAditi, Diti, and Danu  \nObeyed his will as consorts true,  \nAnd Kalaka; but all the rest  \nRefused to hear their lord\'s behest.  \nFirst Aditi conceived, and she,  \nMother of thirty Gods and three,  \nThe Vasus and A\'dityas bare,  \nKudras, and A\'svins, heavenly pair.  \nOf Diti sprang the Daityas: fame  \nDelights to laud their ancient name.  \nIn days of yore their empire dread  \nO\'er earth and woods and ocean spread.  \nDanu was mother of a child,  \nO hero, As\'vagriva styled,  \nAnd Narak next and Kalak came  \nOf Kalaka, celestial dame.  \nOf Tamra, too, five daughters bright  \nIn deathless glory sprang to light.  \nEnnobling fame still keeps alive  \nThe titles of the lovely five:  \nImmortal honour still she claims  \nFor Kraunchi, Bhasi, S\'yeni\'s names.  \nAnd wills not that the world forget  \nS\'uki or Dhritarashtri yet.  \nThen Kraunchi bare the crane and owl,  \nAnd Bhasi tribes of water fowl:  \nVultures and hawks that race through air  \nWith storm-fleet pinions S\'yeni bare.  \nAll swans and geese on mere and brook  \nTheir birth from Dhritarashtri took,  \nAnd all the river-haunting brood  \nOf ducks, a countless multitude.  \nFrom S\'uki Nala sprang, who bare  \nDame Vinata surpassing fair.  \nFrom fiery Krodhavas\'a, ten  \nBright daughters sprang, O King of men:  \nMrigi and Mrigamada named,  \nHari and Bhadiamada famed,  \nS\'arduli, S\'veta fair to see,  \nMatangi bright, and Surabhi,  \nSurasa marked with each fair sign,  \nAnd Kadruma, all maids divine.  \nMrigi, O prince without a peer,  \nWas mother of the herds of deer,  \nThe bear, the yak, the mountain roe  \nTheir birth to Mrigamanda owe;  \nAnd Bhadramada joyed to be  \nMother of fair Iravati,  \nWho bare Airavat,  1 huge of mould,  \nMid warders of the earth enrolled,  \nFrom Hari lordly lions trace,  \nWith monkeys of the wild, their race.  \nFrom the great dame S\'arduli styled  \nSprung pards, Langurs, 2 and tigers wild.  \nMatangi, Prince, gave birth to all  \nMatangas, elephants strong and tall,  \n\nAnd S\'vet\'a bore the beasts who stand  \nOne at each wind, earth\'s warder band.  1b  \nNext Surabhi the Goddess bore  \nTwo heavenly maids, O Prince, of yore,  \nGandharvi--dear *as fa??* is she--  \nAnd her sweet sister Rohini.  \nWith kine this daughter filled each mead,  \nAnd bright Gandharvi bore the steed.  2b  \nSurasa bore the serpents:  3b all  \nThe snakes Kadru their mother call.  \nThen Manu, high-souled Kas\'yap\'s  4b wife,  \nTo all the race of men gave life,  \nThe Brahmans first, the Kshatriya caste,  \nThen Vais\'yas, and the S\'udras last.  \nSprang from her mouth the Brahman race;  \nHer chest the Kshatriyas\' natal place:  \nThe Vais\'yas from her thighs,\'tis said,  \nThe S\'udras from her feet were bred.  \nFrom Anala all trees that hang  \nTheir fair fruit-laden branches sprang.  \nThe child of beauteous S\'uki bore  \nVinata, as I taught before:  \nAnd Surasa and Kadru were  \nBorn of one dame, a noble pair.  \nKadru gave birth to countless snakes  \nThat roam the earth in woods and brakes.  \nArun and Garud swift of flight  \nBy V\'inata were given to light,  \nAnd sons\' of Arun red as morn  \nSampati first, then I was born,  \nMe then, O tamer of the toe,  \nJutayus, son of S\'yeni, know.  \nThy ready helper will I be,  \nAnd guard thy house, if thou agree:  \nWhen thou and Lakshman urge the chase  \nBy Sita\'s side shall be my place.\'  \n   With courteous thanks for promised aid,  \n     The prince, to rapture stirred,  \n   Bent low, and due obeisance paid,  \n     Embraced the royal bird.  \n\np. 247  \n\nHe often in the days gone by  \n   Had heard his father tell  \nHow, linked with him in friendship\'s tie,  \n   He loved Jatayus well.  \nHe hastened to his trusted friend  \n   His darling to confide,  \nAnd through the wood his steps to bend  \n   By strong Jatayus\' side.  \nOn to the grove, with Lakshman near,  \n   The prince his way pursued  \nTo free those pleasant shades from fear  \n   And slay the giant brood.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[245:1](ry211.htm#fr_442) The Madhuka, or, as it is now called, Mahuwa, is the\nBassia latifolia, a tree from whose blossoms a spirit is extracted.\n\n[245:1b](ry212.htm#fr_443) \'I should have doubted whether Manu could have been\nthe right reading here, but that it occurs again in verse 29, where it is in\nlike manner followed in verse 31 by Anala, so that it would certainly seem\nthat the name Manu is intended to stand for a female, the daughter of Daksha.\nThe Gauda recension, followed by Signor Gorresio (III 20, 12), adopts an\nentirely different reading at the end of the line, viz. _Bal am Atibalam api_,\n"Bala and Atibila," instead of Manu and Anala. I see that Professor Roth s.v.\nadduces the authority of the Amara Kosha and of the Commentator on Panini for\nstating that the word sometimes means "the wife of Manu." In the following\ntext of the Mahabharata I. 2553. also, Manu appears to be the name of a\nfemale: _Anaradyam, Manum, Vans am, Asuram, Marganapriyam, Anupam, Subhagdm,\nBhasim iti Pradha vyajayata_. "Pradha (daughter of Daksha) bore Anavadya,\nManu, Vans\'a, Marganapriva, Anupa, Subhaga. and Bhasi."\' _Muir\'s Sanskrit\nText_ , Vol. I. p. 116.\n\n[246:1](ry212.htm#fr_444) The elephant of Indra.\n\n[246:2](ry212.htm#fr_445) _Goling ulas_, described as a kind of monkey, of a\nblack colour, and having a tail like a cow.\n\n[246:1b](ry212.htm#fr_446) Eight elephants attached to the four quarters and\nintermediate points of the compass, to support and guard the earth.\n\n[246:2b](ry212.htm#fr_447) Some scholars identify the centaurs with the\nGandharvas.\n\n[246:3b](ry212.htm#fr_448) The hooded serpents, says the commentator Tirtha,\nwere the offspring of Surasa: all others of Kadru.\n\n[246:4b](ry212.htm#fr_449) The text reads Kas\'yapa, "a descendant of\nKas\'yapa," who according to Ram. II. l0, 6, ought to be Vivasvat. But as it is\nstated in the preceding part of this passage III. 14, 11 f. that Manu was one\nof Kasyapa\'s eight wives, we must here read Kasyapa. The Ganda recension reads\n(III, 20, 30) _Manur manushyams cha tutha janay amasa Raghana**_, instead of\nthe corresponding line in the Bombay edition.\' _Muir\'s Sanskrit Text, Vol I,\np. 117._\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XV.: Panchavatt.](ry213.htm)\n\n'
