When they came near, the Raja\ngrieved and enraged, called out to the Soodru, who art thou, explain who thou\nart, that knowingly beatest a bullock and a cow; do you suppose Urjoon to be\nfar off, that you do not observe his ordinances? Hear me, in the family of\nPandoo, you will not find any such person, in whose presence any one will be\npermitted to vex the poor. Saying this, the Raja took his sword in his hand;\nthe Soodru on seeing this, stood still with fear.--The Raja (the lord of men,)\nhaving\n\np. 2\n\ncalled the bullock and cow near him, enquired of them, explain to me who you\nare, are you gods or Brahmins, and why are you running away? Speak without\nfear, in my presence no one has the power of afflicting you.\n\nOn hearing this, the bullock bending its head said, "O great king! this black\ncoloured, frightful figure in the form of Sin, which is standing in your\npresence is the Black Age, I am running away on account of its approach. This,\nmy companion, is the earth in the form of a cow; she too has come running\ntowards you from dread of the Black Age. My name is Religion: I have four feet\n--penance, truth, compassion, meditation. In the Age of Truth my feet were\ncomplete--consisted of twenty parts; in the Treta Age, they consisted of\nsixteen parts; in the Dwapur Age of twelve; and now in the Black Age, I have\nonly four parts left, for which reason Ian not able to move about in the Black\nAge." The earth said, "O incarnation of justice! I also cannot remain in this\nage, because men of the Soodru caste, having become Rajas, will inflict very\nmany acts of injustice on me, the weight of which I shall not be able to\nendure: from dread of this injustice, I too am running away." On hearing this,\nthe Raja, being angry, said to the Black Age, "I will put thee to death\nimmediately."\n\nOn hearing this, the Black Age falling at the Raja\'s feet, and imploring him\nearnestly, began to say, "O lord of the earth! I have now come under your\nprotection, appoint me some place to dwell in:--because the three times and\nthe four ages, which Bruhmu has established, shall not be effaced in any way."\nHearing this, the Raja Pureechit said to the Black Age--"Dwell in the\nfollowing places, in gambling, lying, in the spirit market, harlots\' houses,\nmurder, theft and gold." Having heard this, the Black Age went to his\nappointed abode, and the Raja established Religion in his own mind; the earth\nassumed his own form, the Raja returned to his own city, and began to govern\njustly and religiously.\n\nAfter some days, the Raja went again to hunt, and whilst engaged in the sport,\nbecame thirsty. The Black Age was\n\np. 3\n\ndwelling in the golden crown on the Raja\'s head, and having obtained his\nopportunity, deprived the Raja of knowledge. The Raja from thirst came to the\nspot where Lomus, a chief of the saints, was seated with his eyes shut,\nmeditating on Muhadeo, and engaged in religious penance.\n\nOn seeing him, Pureechit began to say to himself, this person through pride of\npenance remains with his eyes shut, although he saw me. Entertaining this\nwicked idea, and having raised up with a bow a dead snake which had fallen\nthere, and thrown it on the neck of the chief of the saints, he came home. On\ntaking off his crown, the Raja recovered his knowledge, and reflecting began\nto say, the abode of the Black Age is in gold, he was upon my head, and this\nis the reason of my having performed so vicious an act, as throwing a dead\nsnake on the neck of a chief of the saints; I now know, that the Black Age has\ntaken his revenge upon me; how shall I escape from this great sin; why have I\nnot been deprived to-day of my caste, wealth, family, wives and kingdom--I\nknow not in what birth, this injustice of my having vexed a Brahmin will be\neffaced.\n\n4\\. Whilst the Raja Pureechit was drowned in this sea of unfathomable\nreflection, some boys engaged in play came to the place where Lomus, a chief\nof the saints, was:--they were astonished at seeing a dead snake on his neck,\n--and being frightened, began to say to each other, "Brother, let some one go\nand tell his son of this, who is playing with the saints\' children in the\ngrove on the bank of the river Koushkee." One of the boys hearing this ran to\nwhere Shringee the saint was playing with the saints\' children.--The boy said\nto Shringee, "Brother, why are you playing here; some devil has thrown a dead\nblack snake on your father\'s neck and gone off?"\n\nOn hearing this, Shringee\'s eyes became red--gnashing his teeth, he began to\ntremble; and, being enraged, to say--"In the Black Age proud Rajas have been\nproduced: from the intoxication of wealth, they have become blind and\ninflicters of pain: I will now pronounce a curse on him, who threw the snake,\nhe shall die on the seventh day from this."\n\np. 4\n\n[paragraph continues] Having thus spoken, Shringee the saint took the water of\nthe Koushkee river in the palm of his hand, and pronounced a curse on the Raja\nPureechit, that the snake would bite him on the seventh day.\n\nHaving pronounced this curse on the Raja, he came to his father and took the\nsnake from his neck, and began to say to him, "Father, be of good cheer, I\nhave pronounced a curse on "him, who threw the dead snake on your neck." On\nhearing this, Lomus the saint, awaking from his meditation, opening his eyes\nand deeply considering in his mind his son\'s speech, said to him, "O son! what\nis this thou hast done why have you pronounced a curse on the Raja, under\nwhose government we lived at ease; not a bird, nor a beast even was afflicted.\nSo just was the government, that the lion and cow dwelt under it without\naltercation. O son! what mattered it, if he, in whose country we lived, threw\na dead snake upon me in sport, why did you curse him, and inflict so heavy a\ncurse for a slight fault? you have been guilty of a great crime, and neglected\nto think of what you were doing--you have abandoned good, and embraced evil.\nIt is necessary for a good man to cultivate amiable dispositions; not to say\nanything himself, to hear what others say, and imitate the good qualities, and\navoid the bad qualities, of all."\n\nSaying this, Lomus the saint called one of his pupils, and told him to go and\ntell the Raja Pureechit, that Shringee had pronounced a curse on him; good men\nwill impute blame to Shringee for what he has done, but the Raja on receiving\nthis message will be on his guard. In obedience to the words of his spiritual\npreceptor, the pupil came to the place where the Raja was sitting in\nmeditation, and said to him on his arrival--"Shringee the saint has pronounced\nthis curse on you, that the snake shall bite you on the seventh day--do you\nnow arrange so that you may escape from the noose of fate." On hearing this,\nthe Raja stood up with delight, and joining his hands together began to say,\n"The saint has done me a great kindness in pronouncing a curse, because I had\nfallen\n\np. 5\n\ninto the boundless thoughted sea of delusion, from which he has released me."\n\nWhen the disciple of the sage departed, the Raja performed penance by\nabandoning all the pleasures of the world, and having sent for Junmejye and\nmade over his throne to him, said, "O son! cherish the cow and the Brahmin,\nand give contentment to the subject." Saying this, he went into the female\napartments: the women on seeing him were all sad; his wives (the Ranees) on\nbeholding him fell weeping at his feet, and exclaimed, "O great king! we weak\ncreatures will not be able to endure separation from you; for which reason it\nis better that we should give up our lives with yours."--The Raja said in\nreply, "It is right for a woman to act in such a way, that the character and\ndignity of her husband may be maintained, and not to throw any obstacle in the\nway of an excellent work."\n\nHaving said this, and having abandoned relatives, kindred, and all private and\npublic wealth, he went and sat down on the shore of the Ganges to perform\npenance: whoever heard of the circumstance was much grieved and distressed,\nand shed tears.\n\nWhen the sages heard that the Raja Pureechit had gone to the bank of the\nGanges to die, in consequence of Shringee\'s curse, Byas, Bisist, Bhurdooaj,\nKaiyayun, Purasur, Narud, Biswamittru, Bamdeo, Jumdugun, and eighty-eight\nthousand sages came, and sat down in rows, and thinking upon their Shastrus\nbegan to explain various kinds of religious observances to the Raja--In the\nmeantime, having seen the Raja\'s faith, Shree Shookdeo Jee came also, with a\nbook under his arm, and naked. On seeing him, all the sages rose up, and the\nRaja Pureechit rising up in a supplicating posture, and making an obeisance\nbegan to say, "O abode of compassion you have shown great mercy in remembering\nme at this time."\n\nWhen the Raja had thus spoken, Shookdeo the sage also sat down, when the Raja\nsaid to the sages, "O great kings! Shookdeo Jee is the son of Byas Jee, and\nthe grandson of Purasur Jee, on seeing whom you, who are saints of high rank,\n\np. 6\n\nrose up, which I do not think right: explain the reason of this, that the\ndoubts of my mind may be dissipated."\n\nPurasur the sage said, "Raja! all of us saints, however high in degree, are\ninferior in understanding to Shook, and, therefore, we have all treated him\nwith such respect; some in this hope, that he is the Saviour of the saved,\nbecause from the time of his birth he has spent his life in sadness in the\ndesert; and Raja! all your great excellencies have been increased by the\ncoming of Shookdeo Jee. This will be pronounced the greatest and best of\nreligious and virtuous acts, (dhurum) by means of which having been freed from\nlife and death, you will cross over the sea of the world." On hearing this,\nRaja Pureechit having prostrated himself before Shookdeo Jee, said, "O great\nking! explain the duties of religion to me; how shall I escape from the noose\nof fate, what shall I do in seven days? My impiety has been very great, how\nshall I cross over the sea of the world?" Shree Shookdeo Jee replied, "Raja!\ndo not think the time short, as release can be obtained by religious\nmeditation for an hour, just in the same way that Narud the sage imparted\nunderstanding to the Raja Ruktangool, and he obtained release in two hours;\nseven days are quite sufficient time for you; if you will meditate\nattentively, you will understand all; what the body is, whose abode it is, and\nwho manifests light in it." On hearing this the Raja enquired with great\ndelight, "O great king! which is the most excellent Dhurum, kindly explain to\nme." Shookdeo Jee said, "The Vishnu Dhurum is the greatest amongst the\nDhurums, and the Shree Bhagwut amongst the Pooranus; wherever the worshippers\nof Vishnu recite this history, there all religious observances, and\npilgrimages will come together: Among all the Pooranus, there is none equal to\nthe Bhagwut, for which reason I will recite to you nine parts of the great\nPooranu, in which Byas the sage has instructed me; listen with faith and joy."\n--Upon this the Raja Pureechit began to listen with pleasure, and Shookdeo Jee\naccording to his promise to recite.\n\np. 7\n\nWhen the sage had recited nine parts of the history, the Raja said, "Kind to\nthe poor! have the goodness now to explain to me the history of the descent\nupon earth of Shree Krishnu, because he is our supporter and the object of\nworship of our family." Shookdeo Jee said, "You have conferred great pleasure\non me in asking for this account; I shall most joyfully relate it. In the\nfamily of Yudoo the first Raja was named Bhugwan, whose son was Prithikoo, and\nPrithikoo\'s son was Bidooruth, Bidooruth\'s son was Soorsen, who, having\nconquered nine divisions of the earth, obtained celebrity. Bidooruth\'s wife\'s\nname was Mirkya, who had ten sons and five daughters; the eldest son was\nBasoodeo in whose wife\'s eighth pregnancy Shree Krishnu Chund Jee was born.\nWhen Basoodeo Jee was born, the gods had musical rejoicings in the heavens.\n\n"And amongst the five daughters of Soorsen, Koontee was the eldest, who\nmarried Pandoo, whose story has been sung in the Muhabharut; and Basoodeo Jee\nmarried first Rohnee, the daughter of Raja Rohun, and afterwards seventeen\nother wives--After he had married eighteen times, he married at Muttra,\nDewukee, the sister of Kuns, upon which there was a voice from heaven, that in\nthe eighth pregnancy of this girl the destroyer of Kuns shall be born. On\nhearing this Kuns had his sister and her husband shut up in a house, and Shree\nKrishnu was born there." On hearing thus much of the story, the Raja Pureechit\nsaid, "O great king! how was Kuns born, who conferred a great blessing upon\nhim, and in what manner was Krishnu brought into the world, and how did he\narrive in Gokool:--please explain these circumstances to me." Shree Shookdeo\nJee said, "There was a Raja of Muttra named Ahuk, who had two sons, one named\nDewuk, the other Oogursen. After some time, Oogursen became Raja, who had only\none wife, named Paourekha, very beautiful and chaste, and at all times\nobedient to the commands of her husband. One day she had the menses, and by\npermission of her husband had gone out on a party of pleasure\n\np. 8\n\nto the jungle, in company with her female attendants; there on trees of many\nkinds, all sorts of flowers were blossoming; a cool gentle breeze filled with\nperfume was blowing; cuckoos, pigeons, parrots and peacocks were pouring forth\nsweet and pleasing notes, and on one side under a hill, the Jumna was flowing\napart. The Ranee, on viewing this scene, descended from her car, and whilst\nwalking along alone, suddenly lost her way. By accident, a demon named\nDromullik, came there, and remained gazing in astonishment at her youth, and\nbeautiful appearance; and be began to say to himself, I must have connexion\nwith her. Having resolved upon this, and immediately assuming the form of the\nRaja Oogursen, he went into the presence of the Ranee, and said to her,\nembrace me. The Ranee replied, "O great king! it is not right to indulge in\namatory pleasures in the day-time, because by so doing the good and religious\nqualities of the mind are destroyed. What are you not aware of this, that you\nhave thought of such a vicious act?"\n\nWhen Paourekha had thus spoken, Dromullik having seized the Ranee by the hand\ndrew her towards him, and accomplished what he wished. After he had connexion\nwith the Ranee through the artifice of the disguise, he assumed his own proper\nform; upon which, the Ranee, being exceedingly grieved and afflicted,\nexclaimed, "O unjust, vile sinner! what tyranny have you committed in\ndestroying my virtue! there is a curse on your father, mother and spiritual\npreceptor in thus having formed your understanding. Why was not thy mother\nbarren, rather than produce a son like thee? O devil! all men, who destroy the\nvirtue of women, fall into hell in each successive birth."--Dromullik said,\n"Ranee, do not curse me, for I have given you the fruit of my excellence:\nseeing your womb closed, I suffered great anxiety of mind, which is now gone:\nfrom to-day there is a hope of your pregnancy, and you shall have a son in the\ntenth month:--and from the good properties of my body, thy son having\nconquered the nine divisions of the earth shall be a king, and\n\np. 9\n\nshall fight with Krishnu\\--My first name was Kalnem: then I had an encounter\nwith Billoo: in my present birth I am called Dromullik; I have given thee a\nson, dismiss all anxiety from thy mind."\n\nAfter having thus spoken, when Kalnem had gone away, the Ranee was restored on\nreflection to patience of mind.\n\n"Whatever our fate may be, our understanding will be fashioned in accordance\nwith it--What is to be, will dwell in the mind, all memory and consciousness\nwill vanish."\n\nIn the mean while, or after this, all the female attendants came up, and on\nseeing the Ranee\'s ornaments in disorder, one attendant said, "Where have you\nbeen delayed so long, and what has happened to you?"\n\nPaourekha replied, "You left me, O attendants! alone in the forest--a monkey\ncame and gave me great annoyance, from fear of which I am even now trembling."\n--On hearing this, all the attendants were alarmed and seating the Ranee\nimmediately on her ruth, brought her home.\n\nWhen ten months were completed, a son was born, at which time a violent\ntempest occurred, the earth began to quake, it became so dark, that day was\nturned into night, stars began to fall broken in fragments, the clouds to\nthunder, and the lightning to crack.\n\nIn this manner, on the thirteenth of the light part of the month Magh, on a\nThursday, Kuns was born, on which occasion the Raja Oogursen being delighted\nand having sent for all the musicians of the city, caused musical\nentertainments to be given, and he also sent for all the Brahmins, pundits and\nastrologers, and treated them with very great respect, and dignity. On their\narrival, the Raja offered them seats, after receiving them with great\ncivility. After this, the astrologers having fixed upon the lucky moment, and\ndivision of time, said to the Raja, "O lord of the earth! this child, named\nKuns, who has been born in your family, shall be very powerful,\n\np. 10\n\nand shall reign, associating devils with him, and having caused affliction to\nthe gods, and the worshippers of Vishnu, after having obtained your kingdom,\nhe shall die suddenly by the hand of Huri."\n\nHaving told so much of the history, Shookdeo, the Sage, said to the Raja\nPureechit,--Raja! I will now tell you the history of Dewuk, the brother of\nOogursen, who had four sons, and six daughters, which six he gave in marriage\nto Basoodeo; the seventh was Dewukee, in consequence of whose birth, the gods\nwere delighted; and Oogursen also had ten sons, the eldest of whom was Kuns.\n\nFrom the time of his birth he was in the habit of going into the city, and\nviolently seizing little children, and putting them to death after having shut\nthem up in caves in the hills--Those who were grown up, he got upon their\nchests, and strangled them--No one could escape from this calamity--every one\nconcealed his children--the subjects said, this Kuns is a devil, he does not\nbelong to the family of Oogursen--Some great sinner has been born, who has\nbrought affliction on the whole city. On hearing this, Oogursen sent for him,\nand entered into many explanations with him regarding his conduct, but Kuns\npaid no attention to what he said--Upon this, being grieved and distressed,\nOogursen said, "Why was I not without sons rather than have such a son as\nthis?"\n\nIt is said, that when a degenerate son is born in a family, good name and\ncharacter depart. When Kuns was eight years old, he made an attack upon the\nMugudh country:--the Raja of that country, Jurasindhoo, was very powerful,\nwith whom Kuns contended; and Jurasindhoo acknowledged the power of Kuns, and,\ntreating him with great deference as his superior, gave him two daughters in\nmarriage, whom Kuns brought with him to Muttra, and began to increase his\nenmity against Oogursen. One day he said in a fit of rage to his father, "Give\nup calling on the name of Ram, and offer up your secret prayers to Muhadeo"--\n_the father replied_ , "Ram is my lord\n\np. 11\n\nand the dispeller of my griefs; if I do not worship him, how shall I as a\nsinful man cross over the sea of the world"--Hearing this, Kuns was enraged,\nand having seized his father took possession of the whole government, and\nissued a proclamation in the city, that no one should be allowed to offer up\nsacrifices or gifts, or say prayers, or call upon the name of Ram--Such great\ntyranny prevailed, that the Cow and Brahmin, and the worshipper of Vishnu\nbegan to suffer affliction, and the earth to perish from excessive burdens.\nWhen Kuns had taken possession of the government of all the Rajas, he went one\nday with his army to attack the Raja Indru\\--Upon this occasion, a minister\nsaid to him, "O great king! the country of Indru cannot be obtained without\nprayer and devotion: do not be proud on account of your strength--consider,\nhow their pride brought Kawun and Koonbhkurun to such, destruction, that not\none of their family has been left."\n\nHaving narrated so much of the history, Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja\nPureechit,--O Raja! when this excessive tyranny was exercised upon the earth,\nshe (the earth) assumed the form of a cow, and went lowing into the country of\nthe gods--and having gone to Indru\'s court, bowing her head, she told all her\ntroubles--"O great king! evil spirits have begun to commit great crimes in the\nworld, from dread of whom Religion and Justice have departed--and if I receive\nyour orders, I will abandon the world, and descend to the regions below."--On\nhearing this, Indru, accompanied by all the gods, went to Bruhmu\\--Bruhmu\nhaving heard what they said took them all to Muhadeo, who, having heard the\ncircumstances, went accompanied by all the gods to the place, where Narayun\nwas sleeping in a sea of milk. Knowing him to be asleep, Bruhmu, Roodru, Indru\nand all the gods stood up with their hands in a supplicating posture, and\nmaking obeisances began to sing the praises of the Vedas--"O great and\npowerful king! who can describe thy greatness? In the form of a fish you\nrescued the drowning Vedas--in\n\np. 12\n\nthe shape of a tortoise you supported a hill on your back:--being transformed\ninto a boar, you placed the earth upon one of your tusks; in the form of a\ndwarf, you circumvented the Raja Bul; descending on the earth as Purusram, and\nhaving destroyed the Chutrees, you gave the earth to Kusyp, the sage;\ndescending on the earth as Rain, you destroyed the great demon, Kawun: and\nwhenever devils afflict your worshippers, you come to their assistance.--O\nlord! the earth, much distressed by the tyranny of Kunsu, is calling out to\nthee--be pleased to take her case quickly into consideration, and having\ndestroyed all demons, give pleasure to the good."\n\nThe gods continued thus singing the excellencies of Narayun, when there was a\nvoice from Heaven--Bruhmu explained to all the gods, that the voice they had\njust heard instructed them all, both gods and goddesses to go to Brujmundul,\nand to be born in the city of Muttra: hereafter Vishnu, assuming four shapes,\nwill descend upon the earth in the house of Basoodeo, and the womb of Dewukee,\nand by his childish sports will give pleasure to Nund and Jusodha--When Bruhmu\nhad given this explanation, the gods, sages, heavenly musicians and singers\nwere all, together with their wives, born upon the earth, and came to\nBrujmundul; they called themselves of the family of Yudoo, and cowherds, and\nthe female guardians of the four Vedas went to Bruhmu, and said, "We too will\ndescend upon the earth as cowherdesses, and attend upon Basoodeo"--Saying\nthis, they also came to Bruj, and called themselves cowherdesses. When all the\ngods had arrived at Muttra, Vishnu began to meditate in the sea of milk, that\nLuchmun should first be Bulram, afterwards he (Vishnu) should be named\nBasoodeo; Bhurut should be Purdomun; Suttroogun should be Anooroodru, and\nSeeta should descend on the earth as Rookmunee.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter II](psa03.htm)\n\n'
