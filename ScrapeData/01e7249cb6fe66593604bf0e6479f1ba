And through the co-operativeness (of the works towards the origination of\nknowledge).\n\nThose works are also co-operative with knowledge just because they are\nenjoined as such, viz. in passages such as 'Him the Brahma _n_ as seek to know\nby the study of the Veda,' &c. This has been explained under Sutra 26. Nor\nmust you think that the texts stating the co-operation of the works of the a\n_s_ ramas towards knowledge refer to the fruit of knowledge, as e.g. the\nofferings called praya _g_ as co-operate towards the fruit of the dar _s_ apur\n_n_ amasa of which they are auxiliary members; for knowledge is not\ncharacterised by injunction, and the fruit of knowledge is not to be effected\nby means. Means characterised by injunctions such as the dar _s_ apur _n_\namasa-sacrifice which aim at bringing about certain fruits such as the\nheavenly would require other (subordinate) means co-operating towards the\nfruit (such as the praya _g_ as). But not so knowledge. Compare on this point\nSutra 25. Therefore texts stating the cooperation of works (with knowledge)\nhave to be interpreted as stating that works are means for the origination of\nknowledge.--Nor need we fear that thus there arises a contradiction of\npermanent and non-permanent connexion. For there may be difference of\nconnexion even where there is no difference of work. One connexion is\npermanent, resting on the texts about the life-long performance of the\nagnihotra and so on; of this knowledge is not the result. The other connexion\nis non-permanent, resting on texts such as 'Him the Brahma _n_ as seek to\nknow,' &c.; of this knowledge is the result. The case is analogous to that of\nthe one khadira, which through a permanent connexion serves the purpose of the\nsacrifice, and through a non-permanent connexion the purpose of man.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 34](sbe38243.htm)\n\n"
