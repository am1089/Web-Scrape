(It cannot be maintained that a _g_ a means the\n\np. 253\n\npradhana) because no special characteristic is stated; as in the case of the\ncup.\n\nHere the advocate of the pradhana comes again forward and maintains that the\nabsence of scriptural authority for the pradhana is not yet proved. For, he\nsays, we have the following mantra ( _S_ ve. Up. IV, 5), 'There is one a _g_ a\n1, red, white, and black, producing manifold offspring of the same nature.\nThere is one [a _g_ a](errata.htm#1) who loves her and lies by her; there is\nanother who leaves her after having enjoyed her.'--In this mantra the words\n'red,' 'white,' and 'black' denote the three constituent elements of the\npradhana. Passion is called red on account of its colouring, i.e. influencing\nproperty; Goodness is called white, because it is of the nature of Light;\nDarkness is called black on account of its covering and obscuring property.\nThe state of equipoise of the three constituent elements, i.e. the pradhana,\nis denoted by the attributes of its parts, and is therefore called red-white-\nblack. It is further called a _g_ a, i.e. unborn, because it is acknowledged\nto be the fundamental matter out of which everything springs, not a mere\neffect.--But has not the word a _g_ a the settled meaning of she-goat?--True;\nbut the ordinary meaning of the word cannot be accepted in this place, because\ntrue knowledge forms the general subject-matter.--That pradhana produces many\ncreatures participating in its three constituent elements. One unborn being\nloves her and lies by her, i.e. some souls, deluded by ignorance, approach\nher, and falsely imagining that they experience pleasure or pain, or are in a\nstate of dulness, pass through the course of transmigratory existence. Other\nsouls, again, which have attained to discriminative knowledge, lose their\nattachment to prak _ri_ ti, and leave her after having enjoyed her, i.e. after\nshe has afforded to them enjoyment and release.--On the ground of this\npassage, as interpreted above, the\n\np. 254\n\nfollowers of Kapila claim the authority of Scripture for their pradhana\nhypothesis.\n\nTo this argumentation we reply, that the quoted mantra by no means proves the\nSa _n_ khya doctrine to be based on Scripture. That mantra, taken by itself,\nis not able to give additional strength to any doctrine. For, by means of some\nsupposition or other, the terms a _g_ a, &c. can be reconciled with any\ndoctrine, and there is no reason for the special assertion that the Sa _n_\nkhya doctrine only is meant. The case is analogous to that of the cup\nmentioned in the mantra, 'There is a cup having its mouth below and its bottom\nabove' (B _ri_. Up. II, 2, 3). Just as it is impossible to decide on the\nground of this mantra taken by itself what special cup is meant--it being\npossible to ascribe, somehow or other, the quality of the mouth being turned\ndownward to any cup--; so here also there is no special quality stated, so\nthat it is not possible to decide from the mantra itself whether the pradhana\nis meant by the term a _g_ a, or something else.--But in connexion with the\nmantra about the cup we have a supplementary passage from which we learn what\nkind of cup is meant, 'What is called the cup having its mouth below and its\nbottom above is this head.'--Whence, however, can we learn what special being\nis meant by the a _g_ a of the _S_ veta _s_ vatara-upanishad?--To this\nquestion the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[253:1](sbe34119.htm#fr_237) As the meaning of the word a _g_ a is going to be\ndiscussed, and as the author of the Sutras and _S_ a _n_ kara seem to disagree\nas to its meaning (see later on), I prefer to leave the word untranslated in\nthis place.-- _S_ a _n_ kara reads--and explains,--in the mantra, sarupa _h_\n(not sarupam) and bhuktabhogam, not bhuktabhogyam.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4, 9](sbe34120.htm)\n\n"
