For him\n\np. 107\n\nthere is only delay so long as he is not delivered (from the body); then he\nwill be perfect 1.\n\n3\\. \'That which is the subtile essence, in it all that exists has its self. It\nis the True. It is the Self, and thou, O _S_ vetaketu, art it.\'\n\n\'Please, Sir, inform me still more,\' said the son.\n\n\'Be it so, my child,\' the father replied.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[105:2](sbe01132.htm#fr_296) The question here asked is: The salt, though no\nlonger perceptible by means of sight or touch, could be discovered by taste.\nThen how can the Sat be discovered, although it is imperceptible by all the\nsenses?\n\n[105:3](sbe01132.htm#fr_297) The Gandharas, but rarely mentioned in the Rig-\nveda and the Ait. Brahma _n_ a, have left their name in \xce\x9a\xce\xac\xce\xbd\xce\xb4\xce\xb1\xcf\x81\xce\xbf\xce\xb9 and Candahar.\nThe fact of their name being evidently quite familiar to the author of the\nUpanishad might be used to prove either its antiquity or its Northern origin.\n\n[106:1](sbe01132.htm#fr_298) Tedious as the commentator is in general, he is\nsometimes almost eloquent in bringing out all that is implied or supposed to\nbe implied in the sacred text. He explains the last simile as follows: A man\nwas carried away by robbers from his own country. After his eyes had been\ncovered, he was taken to a forest full of terrors and dangers arising from\ntigers, robbers, &c. Not knowing where he was, and suffering from hunger and\nthirst, he began to cry, wishing to be delivered from his bonds. Then a man\ntook pity on him and removed his bonds, and when he had returned to his home,\nhe was happy. Next follows the application. Our real home is the True (Sat),\nthe Self of the world. The forest into which we are driven is the body, made\nof the three elements, fire, water, earth, consisting of blood, flesh, bones,\n&c., and liable to cold, heat, and many other evils. The bands with which our\neyes are covered are our desires for many things, real or unreal, such as wife\nchildren, cattle, &c., while the robbers by whom we are driven into the forest\nare our good and evil deeds. Then we cry and say: \'I am the son of so and so,\nthese arc my relatives, I am happy, I am miserable, I am foolish, I am wise, I\nam just, I am born, I am dead, I am old, I am wretched, my son is dead, my\nfortune is gone, I am undone, how shall I live, where shall I go, who will\nsave me?\' These and hundreds and thousands of other evils are the bands which\nblind us. Then, owing to some supererogatory good works we may have done, we\nsuddenly meet a man who knows the Self of Brahman, whose own bonds have been\nbroken, who takes pity on us and shows us the way to see the evil which\nattaches to all p. 107 that we love in this world. We then withdraw ourselves\nfrom all worldly pleasures. We learn that we are not mere creatures of the\nworld, the son of so and so, &c., but that we are that which is the True\n(Sat). The bands of our ignorance and blindness are removed, and, like the man\nof Gandhara, we arrive at our own home, the Self, or the True. Then we are\nhappy and blessed.\n\n[107:1](sbe01132.htm#fr_299) The last words are really--\'for him there is only\ndelay so long as I shall not be delivered; then I shall be perfect.\' This\nrequires some explanation. First of all, the change from the third to the\nfirst person, is best explained by assuming that at the point where all\nindividuality vanishes, the father, as teacher, identifies himself with the\nperson of whom he is speaking.\n\nThe delay (the _k_ ira or kshepa) of which he speaks is the time which passes\nbetween the attainment of true knowledge and death, or freedom from the\neffects of actions performed before the attainment of knowledge. The actions\nwhich led to our present embodiment must be altogether consumed, before the\nbody can perish, and then only are we free. As to any actions performed after\nthe attainment of knowledge, they do not count; otherwise there would be a new\nembodiment, and the attainment of even true knowledge would never lead to\nfinal deliverance.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 15](sbe01133.htm)\n\n'
