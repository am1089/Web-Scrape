Vyasa said :-- O king! Those Kumaris, who are defective in limbs, who are\nlepers, who are filled with sores and ulcers over their bodies, whose bodies\nemit offensive smell or whose bodies are polluted, or those who are\n\n\n\np. 230\n\n\n\nof a bad family are never to be accepted for worship in the Navaratra ceremony\nfestival.\n\n\n\n2-3. Those who are born blind, who are squint-eyed, who are blind of one eye,\nof disgraceful appearance, whose bodies are overgrown with hairs, or who are\ndiseased or who are in their menstruation or in any other signs, indicating\nthus their passionate youthful tendencies, or those who are very lean and\nthin, or born of widows, or of women unmarried are always to be avoided in\nthis Puja.\n\n\n\n4\\. O king! It is only the healthy, graceful, beautiful, without any ulcers,\nand who are not bastards, those virgins are to be selected for the Kumari\nPuja.\n\n\n\n5\\. In all the cases, the Kumaris, born of the Brahmi _n_ families, can be\ntaken; when victory is desired, the Kumaris of the K _s_ hattriya families are\npreferred; when profit is wanted, the Vais\xc2\x92ya Kumaris and, when general\nwelfare is wanted, the S\xc2\x92udra Kumaris are to be taken.\n\n\n\n6-7. O king! In the Navaratri Puja, the Brahmi _n_ s should select for worship\nthe Brahmi _n_ Kumaris; K _s_ hattriyas, Brahmi _n_ or K _s_ hattriya; the\nVais\xc2\x92ya worshippers can select for worship Brahmi _n_ , K _s_ hattriya, or\nVais\xc2\x92ya Kumaris. And the S\xc2\x92udra worshippers can select, for worship, any of\nthe four classes. But artists and artisans should select for worship the\nKumaris from their own families and tribes respectively.\n\n\n\n8\\. If persons become unable to worship on all the days, then it is advised\nthat they should perform the special worship on the eighth day (Astami tithi).\n\n\n\n9-10. In ancient times, on the eighth day, Bhadra Kali Goddess, the destroyer\nof the sacrifice, started by Dak _s_ a, appeared on that day in hideous forms,\nsurrounded by hundreds and lakhs of Yoginis (one of a class of sixty goddesses\nor female attendants on Kali). Therefore one should worship in particular on\nthe eighth day with scents, garlands, and pastes and various offerings.\n\n\n\n11\\. On this day, Payasa (a food prepared of rice, milk and sugar), and fresh\nfish are to be specially offered to the Deity. The Homa ceremonies, feasting\nof the Brahma _n_ s, and the worship of the Mother Goddess are done with\nvarious offerings, the fruits and flowers, and in good quantities.\n\n\n\n12\\. O king! Those who are unable to observe the fasting in this Navaratra\nPuja, will reap the same fruits, if they observe fasting for the three days\nonly the Saptami, the A _st_ ami, and the Navami tithis.\n\n\n\n13\\. On the seventh, eighth, and ninth days, in these three tithis (lunar\ndays) if one worships with devotion, one will acquire all the merits.\n\n\n\n14\\. When the Devi\xc2\x92s worship, Homa, Kumari worship and the feasting of the\nBrahma _n_ as, all these are done, know that the Navaratri Puja is completed.\n\n\n\np. 231\n\n\n\n15\\. O Janamejaya! No worship or vow or charitable gifts extant in this world,\ncan be compared, as regards their meritorious effects, with this Navaratra\nPuja.\n\n\n\n16\\. On observing this Navaratram Vrata, one gets riches, crops, sons and\ngrandsons, prosperity and happiness, longevity, health and heaven and even the\nfinal beatitude.\n\n\n\n17\\. Those who are desirous of learning, riches, or sons will get them all if\nthey perform this most auspicious Navaratra ceremony, able to confer fortunes\non the devotees.\n\n\n\n18\\. On the performance of this sacrifice, those who want learning get all the\nlearning; and he, who is deprived of his kingdom will get back all his\nkingdoms.\n\n\n\n19\\. Those who did not, in their previous births, perform this meritorious\nvow, they become diseased, poor and devoid of sons in their present births.\n\n\n\n20\\. Those women that are barren, or widows or devoid of sons, infer that they\nnever, in their previous births, performed this sacrifice.\n\n\n\n21\\. Those who have not performed the Navaratra ceremony, how can they acquire\nriches in this world and acquire happiness and peace in the next?\n\n\n\n22\\. He who has worshipped the Goddess Bhagavati Bhavani Devi with young\nleaves of the Bel tree, besmeared with red sandal paste, it is he that will\nundoubtedly become the king in this world.\n\n\n\n23\\. That man who has failed to worship the Goddess of the whole universe, Who\nfructifies all the pursuits of human life, Who destroys all the troubles,\npains and miseries, Who is all suspicious Bhagavati Bhavani, that fellow is\nsure to pass his days in this world, wretched, impoverished, and surrounded by\nhis enemies on all sides.\n\n\n\n24\\. When Hari, Hara, Brahma, Indra, Fire, Varu _n_ a, Kuvera, and the Sun\nwhen all these possessing all the wealth and powers and filled with the\nhighest felicities, when they meditate constantly the Goddess of the universe,\nWho is All Existence Intelligence, and Bliss, then what to speak of the human\nbeings! How is it that persons do not worship that Chandika Devi, the One that\nleads all human pursuits to success!\n\n\n\n25-26. Why should not the people worship the Goddess Bhavani, the bestower of\nall happiness, whose other names are Svaha and Svadha, the mantrams under\nwhose intrinsic energies the Devas and the Pitris always get satisfied, and\nwhich are recited by all the Munis when they chant in every sacrifice the\nVedic mantrams? Under Whose Will power Brahma the Creator, creates all this\nUniverse? Under Whose energy, the\n\n\n\np. 232\n\n\n\nVi _sn_ u Janaradan, the Deva of the Devas, incarnates in this earth in\nvarious forms and preserves this world, and under Whose power, S\xc2\x92ankara\ndestroys this whole Universe?\n\n\n\n27\\. No body, in this whole universe, can have his existence without having\nrecourse to that Prakriti Devi, the S\xc2\x92akti incarnate; be he a Devi, a human\nbeing or a bird, or a serpent, Gandharva, Rakhsasa, Pis\xc2\x92acha, a mountain or a\ntree, he cannot move even of his own accord, without the help of this Force.\n\n\n\n28\\. Therefore, why should not anybody worship that Chandika Devi, the Awarder\nof all desires and wealth? And how is it, that a man desiring one of the 4\nobjects of human pursuits, Dharma, wealth, desires, and the final beatitude,\nobserves not the vow regarding that Deity.\n\n\n\n29\\. So much so, that even a man who has committed a heinous offence, five\nsuch are enumerated, viz. (1) killing a Brahma _n_ , (2) drinking liquor, (3)\nstealing gold, (4) adultery with the wife of a spiritual guide (5) associating\nwith any such person, if he performs the Navaratra vow, he will be absolved\nentirely from all such sins; there is no doubt in this.\n\n\n\n30\\. O king! Once on a time there lived in the country of Kosala, a trader,\npoor and miserable, having under him many relations and dependants in his\nfamily, whose provisions he had to provide.\n\n\n\n31\\. He had many sons and daughters; when they were very hungry and\ndistressed, then they used to get a little food and that in the evening, only\nonce in twenty-four hours.\n\n\n\n32\\. That trader, too, worked under another, the whole day; and when it was\nevening, he used also to take his meals. Thus, being very much anxious and\ndistressed, he maintained somehow or other his family members (that are to be\nmaintained).\n\n\n\n33-34. This trader was of a quiet temper, of a good conduct, truthful, always\nready to act religiously, devoid of anger, steady and contented, void of\nvanity and jealousy; daily he used to worship the Devas, Pitris, and the\nguests and used to take his meals after all his family members had taken their\nmeals.\n\n\n\n35-36. Thus many days passed away when that good trader, named Sus\xc2\x92ila, being\nvery much perplexed with poverty and hunger, asked a quiet tempered Brahmi _n_\n\xc2\x93O Bhudeva! (deva incarnate on the earth) kindly tell me positively how this\nstate of poverty can be got rid off!\n\n\n\n37\\. O holy minded! Kindly advise me such as preserves my honour; I do not\nwant wealth, nor do I like to be a rich man; O Brahmi _n_! I want just enough\nto meet with the expenses, incurred in maintaining my family; please advise so\nthat I may be able to earn this much only.\n\n\n\np. 233\n\n\n\n38\\. I have many sons; I have not got any food, sufficient enough to give them\neven a handful of rice.\n\n\n\n39\\. Alas! My youngest son was crying today for food; I have driven him out of\nthe house by chastising him. O Brahmi _n_! What am I do? I have got no wealth;\nmy heart is burning with grief and sorrow; my baby has gone out of the house,\nweeping and hungry.\n\n\n\n40\\. My daughter has come to a marriageable age; I have no money. Her age has\nexceeded ten years; the marriageable age limit has been exceeded. Alas! What\nam I to do?\n\n\n\n41-42. O Brahmi _n_! I am expressing my sorrow for all that. You are merciful,\nand all-knowing; tell me any means, be it asceticism, gifts, vow, or the\nreciting of any mantrams by which I can maintain my family; I want wealth just\nsufficient for that purpose and nothing more.\n\n\n\n43\\. O high minded one! Kindly devise and tell me some means by which my\nfamily members become happy in this world.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n44-46. Vyasa said :-- The Brahmi _n_ that used to practice vows when thus\nasked by the trader told him gladly \xc2\x93O trader! Do now the Navaratri vow, the\nmost auspicious, and worship the Bhagavati, perform Homa, and feast the Brahmi\n_n_ s. Have the Vedas and Pura _n_ as recited and recite then slowly the\nS\xc2\x92akti mantram and try, as much as you can, to do other concomitant\nceremonies; and your desires will thus be undoubtedly fulfilled.\n\n\n\n47\\. There is no other vow superior to this in this world; this vow is very\nholy and will bring unto you happiness.\n\n\n\n48\\. This vow leads to wisdom and liberation; destroys enemies and increases\nposterity and prosperity.\n\n\n\n49\\. In former days, S\xc2\x92ri Rama Chandra suffered very much owing to his being\ndeprived of his kingdom; and, then on account of his wife being stolen away.\nSubsequently he performed this Navaratra vow in Kiskindhya, his heart being\nheavily laden with grief.\n\n\n\n50\\. Though troubled very much, on account of the bereavement of Sita, still\nRama Chandra observed the Vow of Navaratra and worshipped the Goddess\naccording to the prescribed rules and rites.\n\n\n\n51-52. As a fruit of this worship he was able to bridge the great ocean and\nkill the giant Kumbha Kar _n_ a, Meghanada, the Rava _n_ a\xc2\x92s son, and Rava _n_\na, the king of Lanka; and subsequently he was able to recover his Sita. He\ninstalled Vibhi _s_ a _n_ a on the throne of Lanka (Ceylon) and at last\nreturned to Ayodhya and reigned there without any enemies.\n\n\n\np. 234\n\n\n\n53\\. O best of the Vais\xc2\x92yas! Rama Chandra, of incomparable prowess, was able\nto obtain happiness in this world on account of the influence of this\nNavaratra ceremony.\n\n\n\n54-55. Vyasa said :-- O king! That Vais\xc2\x92ya, hearing thus the Brahmi _n_ \xc2\x92s\nwords, made him his Guru, was initiated by him in the seed mantra of Maya and\nceaselessly, without any laziness, recited slowly the mantram for nine nights\nand worshipped the Devi, with great caution and with various offerings. Thus\nfor nine consecutive years he devoted himself to the Japam (reciting slowly)\nof the seed mantra of Maya till, at last, when the ninth year was completed,\nthe Great Goddess appeared distinctly before his eyes on the night of the\ngreat Astami tithi (the eighth day of the bright half) and gave him various\nboons and delivered the Vais\xc2\x92ya from poverty and bestowed on him wealth and\nhis other desired things.\n\n\n\nHere ends the 27th Chapter on the virgins fit to be worshipped and the Glory\nof the Devi in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam by Mahar _s_ i\nVeda Vyasa in the Third Adhyaya.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 28](bk03ch28.htm)\n\n'
