Now Uddalaka \xc3\x82ru _n_ i 3 was driving about 4, as a chosen\n(offering-priest), amongst the people of\n\np. 51\n\nthe northern country. By him a gold coin was offered; for in the time of our\nforefathers a prize used to be offered by chosen (priests) when driving about,\nfor the sake of calling out the timid 1 to a disputation. Fear then seized the\nBrahma _n_ as of the northern people:--\n\n11:4:1:22\\. 'This fellow is a Kurupa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ala Brahman, and son of a Brahman\n--let us take care lest he should deprive us of our domain: come, let us\nchallenge him to a disputation on spiritual matters.'--'With whom for our\nchampion?'--'With Svaidayana.' Svaidayana, to wit, was _S_ aunaka.\n\n11:4:1:33\\. They said, 'Svaidayana, with thee as our champion we will fight\nthis fellow.' He said, 'Well, then, stay ye here quietly: I will just make his\nacquaintance 2.' He went up to him, and when he had come up, he (Uddalaka)\ngreeted him saying,\n\np. 52\n\n[paragraph continues] 'Svaidayana!'--'Halloo, son of Gautama!' replied the\nother, and straightway, began to question him.\n\n11:4:1:44\\. 'He alone, O son of Gautama, may drive about amongst people as\nchosen (offering-priest), who knows in the Full and New-moon sacrifices eight\nbutter-portions (offered) previously, five portions of sacrificial food in the\nmiddle, six (portions) of Pra _g_ apati, and eight butter-portions (offered)\nsubsequently.\n\n11:4:1:55\\. 'He alone, O son of Gautama, may drive about amongst people as\nchosen (priest), who knows from the Full and New-moon sacrifices 1 whereby it\nis that creatures here are born toothless, whereby they (the teeth) grow with\nthem, whereby they decay with them, whereby they come to remain permanently\nwith them; whereby, in the last stage of life, they all decay again with them;\nwhereby the lower ones grow first, then the upper ones; whereby the lower ones\nare smaller, and the upper ones broader; whereby the incisors are larger, and\nwhereby the molars are of equal size.\n\n11:4:1:66\\. 'He alone, O son of Gautama, may drive about amongst people as\nchosen (priest), who knows from the Full and New-moon sacrifices, whereby\ncreatures here are born with hair; whereby, for the second time, as it were,\nthe hair of the beard and the arm-pits and other parts of the body 2 grow on\nthem; whereby it is on the head that one first\n\np. 53\n\nbecomes grey, and then, again, in the last stage of life, one becomes grey all\nover.\n\n11:4:1:77\\. 'He alone, O son of Gautama, may drive about amongst people as\nchosen (priest), who knows from the Full and New-moon sacrifices whereby the\nseed of the boy is not productive, whereby in his middle age it is productive,\nand whereby again in his last stage of life it is not productive;--\n\n11:4:1:88\\. 'And he who knows the golden, brilliant-winged Gayatri who bears\nthe Sacrificer to the heavenly world.' Then he (Uddalaka) gave up to him the\ngold coin, saying, 'Thou art learned, Svaidayana; and, verily, gold is given\nunto him who knows gold;' and he (Svaidayana), having concealed it 1, went\naway. They asked him, 'How did that son of Gautama behave?'\n\n11:4:1:99\\. He said, 'Even as a Brahman, and the son of a Brahman: the head\nwould fly off of whosoever should (dare to) challenge him to a disputation 2.'\nThey then went away in all directions. He (Uddalaka) then came back to him,\nwith fire-wood\n\np. 54\n\nin his hand 1, and said, 'I want to become thy pupil.'--'What wouldst thou\nstudy?'--'Even those questions which thou didst ask me--explain them to me!'\nHe said, 'I will tell them to thee even without thy becoming my pupil.'\n\n11:4:1:1010\\. And he then spoke thus to him:--The two libations of ghee, the\nfive fore-offerings, and, eighth, Agni's butter-portion--these are the eight\nbutter-portions (offered) previously. Soma's butter-portion, being the first\nof the portions of sacrificial food--for Soma is sacrificial food,---Agni's\ncake, Agni-Soma's low-voiced offering, Agni-Soma's cake, and (the offering to)\nAgni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t--these are the five portions of sacrificial food in\nthe middle.\n\n11:4:1:1111\\. The fore-portion, the I _d_ a, what he hands to the Agnidh 2,\nthe Brahman's portion, the Sacrificer's portion, and the Anvaharya (mess of\nrice)--these are the six (portions) of Pra _g_ apati. The three after-\nofferings, the four Patnisa _m_ ya _g_ as, and, eighth, the Samish _t_ aya _g_\nus--these are the eight butter-portions (offered) subsequently.\n\n11:4:1:1212\\. And inasmuch as the fore-offerings are without invitatory\nformulas 3, therefore creatures are horn here without teeth; and inasmuch as\nthe chief oblations have invitatory formulas, therefore they (the teeth) grow\nin them; and inasmuch as the after-offerings are without invitatory formulas,\ntherefore they (the teeth) decay in them; and inasmuch as the Patnisa _m_ ya\n_g_ as as have invitatory formulas,\n\np. 55\n\ntherefore they (the teeth) come to remain permanently with them; and inasmuch\nas the Samish _t_ aya _g_ us is without invitatory formula, therefore they all\ndecay again in the last stage of life.\n\n11:4:1:1313\\. And inasmuch as, after uttering the invitatory formula, he\noffers with the offering-formula, therefore the lower (teeth) grow first, then\nthe upper ones; and inasmuch as, after uttering a gayatri verse as invitatory\nformula, he offers with a trish _t_ ubh verse 1, therefore the lower (teeth)\nare smaller, and the upper ones broader; and inasmuch as he pours out the two\nlibations of ghee in a forward direction 2, therefore the incisors are larger;\nand inasmuch as the two sa _m_ ya _g_ yas 3 are in the same metre, therefore\nthe molars are of equal size.\n\n11:4:1:1414\\. And inasmuch as he spreads a cover of sacrificial grass (on the\nVedi), therefore creatures here are born with hair; and inasmuch as he for the\nsecond time, as it were, spreads the Prastara-bunch 4, therefore, for the\nsecond time, as it were, the hair of the beard and the arm-pits, and other\nparts of the body grow; and inasmuch as at first he only throws the Prastara-\nbunch after (the oblations into the fire), therefore it is on the head that\none first becomes grey; and inasmuch as he then throws after it all the\nsacrificial grass of the altar-ground, therefore,\n\np. 56\n\nin the last stage of life, one again becomes grey all over.\n\n11:4:1:1515\\. And inasmuch as the fore-offerings have ghee for their offering-\nmaterial, a boy's seed is not productive, but is like water, for ghee is like\nwater; and inasmuch as, in the middle of the sacrifice, they sacrifice with\nsour curds 1 and with cake, therefore it is productive in his middle stage of\nlife, for thick-flowing, as it were, is (that havis), and thick-flowing, as it\nwere, is seed; and inasmuch as the after-offerings have ghee for their\noffering-material, it again is not productive in his last stage of life, and\nis like water, for ghee, indeed, is like water.\n\n11:4:1:1616\\. The Vedi (altar-ground), doubtless, is the Gayatri: the eight\nbutter-portions (offered) previously are her right wing, and the eight butter-\nportions (offered) subsequently are her left wing: that same golden,\nbrilliant-winged Gayatri, indeed, bears the Sacrificer who knows this to the\nheavenly world.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[50:3](sbe44021.htm#fr_190) For another version of this legend see Gopatha-\nBrahma _n_ a I, 3, 6. See also Prof. Geldner's translation in Pischel and G.'s\nVedische Studien II, p. 185.\n\n[50:4](sbe44021.htm#fr_191) Prof. Geldner takes 'dhavaya _m_ _k_ akara' in a\ncausal sense p. 51, 'er verursachte einen Anflauf' (he caused people to crowd\ntogether, or to come to him in crowds). Saya _n_ a, however, takes it in the\nsame sense as we have. done,--artvi _g_ yaya v _ri_ ta _h_ sann udagde _s_ an\n_g_ agama. The Gopatha-Br., further on, has the remark 'sa vai gotamasya putra\nurdhva _m_ v _ri_ to\xe0\xa4\xbddhavit' (!).\n\n[51:1](sbe44021.htm#fr_192) It is by no means certain whether the\ninterpretation of the paragraph as here adapted is the right one. Prof.\nGeldner takes it thus,--'He (Udd.) had taken a gold piece with him; for in\ntimes of old the chosen (priests) who caused a crowd to gather round them,\nused to take a single gold piece with them with a view to their proposing a\nriddle (or problem) whenever they were afraid.' The Gopatha-Br. has a\ndifferent reading, which is likewise far from clear:--tasya ha nishka upahito\nbabhuva, upavadad bibhyato yo ma brahma _n_ o\xe0\xa4\xbdnu _k_ ana upavadishyati tasma\netam pradasyamiti;--by him a gold coin was offered (? by him a gold plate had\nbeen put on, i.e. was worn round the neck) being afraid of obloquy (?): 'I\nshall give this to any learned Brahman who will speak up against me,' thus (he\nthought).\n\n[51:2](sbe44021.htm#fr_193) Or, I'll just find out what kind of man he is.\n\n[52:1](sbe44021.htm#fr_194) Literally, who knows that (element) in the Full\nand New-moon sacrifices whereby . . .\n\n[52:2](sbe44021.htm#fr_195) The word 'durbiri _n_ ani' is of doubtful meaning,\nthe etymology proposed by Saya _n_ a having little claim to being seriously\nconsidered. In the St. Petersb. Dict. the meaning 'bristly' is assigned to it,\nas applied to the hair of the beard.\n\n[53:1](sbe44021.htm#fr_196) Saya _n_ a takes 'upaguhya' in the sense of\n'having embraced (him),' that being the meaning the verb has in classical\nSanskrit;--ta _m_ Svaidayanam upaguhya ali\xe1\xb9\x85gya Uddalakas tasmat sthanan ni _s_\n_k_ akrama nishkrantavan. The Gopatha-Br. has 'tad upayamya' (having taken it)\ninstead. Svaidayana evidently did not wish the other Brahmans to know that he\nhad had the better of the Kurupa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ala.\n\n[53:2](sbe44021.htm#fr_197) ? Or, to catechize him; Brahma svaya _m_ vedadya\n_h_ brahmaputro brahmish _th_ asya Gotamasya putra ity etad yathav _ri_ ttam\neva, api to ya _h_ purusha enam Uddalakam upavalheta pradhana _m_ _s_ resh\n_th_ ya _m_ (? _s_ resh _th_ a _m_ ) kuryat--varha valha pradhanya iti dhatu\n_h_ \\--asya purushasya murdha vipatet, alpa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anasya adhikyena\nviparyayagraha _n_ at tannimitta- _s_ ira _h_ patanam bhavatity artha _h_ ,\nSay.--Prof. Geldner translates,--'He must rack his brains (muss sich den Kopf\nzerbrechen) who wants to outdo him in questions (uberfragen).'\n\n[54:1](sbe44021.htm#fr_198) That is, as a pupil (brahma _k_ arin) would to his\nteacher.\n\n[54:2](sbe44021.htm#fr_199) Viz. the 'sha _d_ avatta,' or share consisting of\nsix 'cuttings,' for which see I, 8, 1, 41 with note.\n\n[54:3](sbe44021.htm#fr_200) With these oblations there is no puro\xe0\xa4\xbdnuvakya, but\nonly a ya _g_ ya, or offering-formula.\n\n[55:1](sbe44021.htm#fr_201) Whilst the gayatri verse consists of 3 \xc3\x97 8\nsyllables, the trish _t_ ubh has 4 \xc3\x97 11 syllables.\n\n[55:2](sbe44021.htm#fr_202) That is, pouring the second into the fire at a\nplace immediately to the front, or eastward, of the first.\n\n[55:3](sbe44021.htm#fr_203) That is, the invitatory and offering-formulas used\nfor the oblation to Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t; see part i, p. 307, note 1.\n\n[55:4](sbe44021.htm#fr_204) For this bunch taken from the sacrificial grass\nbefore it is spread on the altar-ground, and symbolically representing the\nSacrificer, see I, 3, 3, 4 seqq.; and part i, p. 84, note 2.\n\n[56:1](sbe44021.htm#fr_205) That is, at the New-moon sacrifice, with the\nSannayya, or mixture of sour curds with sweet boiled milk. The 'iti' after\n'puro _d_ a _s_ ena' is taken by Saya _n_ a in the sense of ' _k_ a'; and\nthough this cannot be accepted, it is not very easy to see what force it can\nhave here.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 4, 2.
