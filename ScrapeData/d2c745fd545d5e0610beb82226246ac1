A contemplation of Brahman (is to be superinduced on symbols of Brahman),\non account of the exaltation (thereby bestowed on the symbols).\n\nWith regard to the texts quoted above there arises another doubt, viz. whether\nthe contemplation of \xc3\x82ditya and so on is to be superimposed on Brahman, or the\ncontemplation of Brahman on \xc3\x82ditya and so on 1.--But whence does this doubt\narise?--From the absence of a decisive reason, owing to the grammatical co-\nordination. For we observe in the sentences quoted a co-ordination of the term\n'Brahman' with the terms '\xc3\x82ditya,' &c. '\xc3\x82ditya is Brahman,' 'Pra _n_ a is\nBrahman,' 'Lightning is Brahman;' the text exhibiting the two members of each\nclause in the same case. And here there is no obvious occasion for co-\nordination because the words 'Brahman' on the one hand, and '\xc3\x82ditya' and so on\non the other hand, denote different things; not any more than there exists a\nrelation of co-ordination which could be expressed by the sentence 'The ox is\na horse.'--But cannot Brahman and \xc3\x82ditya and so on be viewed as co-ordinated\non the basis of the relation connecting a causal substance and its effects,\nanalogously to the case of clay and earthen vessels?--By no means, we reply.\nFor in that case dissolution of the effect would result from its co-ordination\nwith the causal substance, and that--as we have already explained--would imply\nnon-existence of the symbol. Moreover, the scriptural passages would then be\nstatements about the highest Self, and thereby the qualification for\nmeditations would be sublated 2; and further the mention of a limited effect\nwould be purposeless  3. It follows herefrom that we have\n\np. 343\n\nto do here with the superimposition of the contemplation of one thing on\nanother thing--just as in the case of the text, 'The Brahma _n_ a is Agni Vai\n_s_ vanara,'--and the doubt therefore arises the contemplation of which of the\ntwo things is to be superimposed on the other.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that there exists no fixed rule for this case,\nbecause we have no scriptural text establishing such a rule.--Or else, he\nsays, contemplations on \xc3\x82ditya and so on are exclusively to be superimposed on\nBrahman. For in this way Brahman is meditated upon by means of contemplations\non \xc3\x82ditya, and scripture decides that meditations on Brahman are what is\nproductive of fruits. Hence contemplations on Brahman are not to be\nsuperimposed on \xc3\x82ditya and so on.\n\nTo this we make the following reply. The contemplation on Brahman is\nexclusively to be superimposed on \xc3\x82ditya and so on.--Why?--'On account of\nexaltation.' For thus \xc3\x82ditya and so on are viewed in an exalted way, the\ncontemplation of something higher than they being superimposed on them.\nThereby we also comply with a secular rule, viz. the one enjoining that the\nidea of something higher is to be superimposed upon something lower, as when\nwe view--and speak of--the king's charioteer as a king. This rule must be\nobserved in worldly matters, because to act contrary to it would be\ndisadvantageous; for should we view a king as a charioteer, we should thereby\nlower him, and that would be no ways beneficial.--But an objection is raised,\nas the whole matter rests on scriptural authority, the suspicion of any\ndisadvantage cannot arise; and it is, further, not appropriate to define\ncontemplations based on scripture by secular rules!--That might be so, we\nreply, if the sense of scripture were fully ascertained; but as it is liable\nto doubt, there is no objection to our having recourse to a secular rule\nwhereby to ascertain it. And as by means of that rule we decide that what\nscripture means\n\np. 344\n\nis the superimposition of a higher contemplation on something lower, we should\nincur loss by superimposing a lower contemplation upon something higher.--As\nmoreover in the passages under discussion the words '\xc3\x82ditya' and so on stand\nfirst, they must, this being not contradictory, be taken in their primary\nsense. But, as our thought is thus defined by these words taken in their true\nliteral sense, the word 'Brahman,' which supervenes later on, cannot be co-\nordinated with them if it also be taken in its true literal sense, and from\nthis it follows that the purport of the passages can only be to enjoin\ncontemplations on Brahman (superinduced on \xc3\x82ditya and so on).--The same sense\nfollows from the circumstance that the word 'Brahman' is, in all the passages\nunder discussion, followed by the word 'iti,' 'thus 1.' 'He is to meditate (on\n\xc3\x82ditya, &c.) as Brahman.' The words '\xc3\x82ditya' and so on, on the other hand, the\ntext exhibits without any such addition. The passages therefore are clearly\nanalogous to such sentences as 'He views the mother o' pearl as silver,' in\nwhich the word 'mother o' pearl' denotes mother o' pearl pure and simple,\nwhile the word 'silver' denotes, by implication, the idea of silver; for the\nperson in question merely thinks 'this is silver' while there is no real\nsilver.' Thus our passages also mean, 'He is to view \xc3\x82ditya and so on as\nBrahman.'--The complementary clauses, moreover, which belong to the passages\nunder discussion ('He who knowing this meditates (upon) \xc3\x82ditya as Brahman;'\n'Who meditates (on) speech as Brahman;' 'Who meditates (on) will as Brahman')\nexhibit the words '\xc3\x82ditya' and so on in the accusative case, and thereby show\nthem to be the direct objects of the action of meditation 2.--Against the\nremark that in all the mentioned cases Brahman only has to be meditated upon\nin order that a fruit may result from the meditation, we point out that from\nthe mode of proof used\n\np. 345\n\nabove we infer that (not Brahman but) only \xc3\x82ditya and so on have to be\nmeditated upon. But as in the case of hospitality shown to guests, Brahman,\nthat is the supreme ruler of all, will give the fruit of meditations on \xc3\x82ditya\nand so on as well. This we have already shown under III, 2, 28. And, after\nall, Brahman also is meditated upon (in the cases under discussion) in so far\nas a contemplation on Brahman is superinduced on its symbols, analogously as a\ncontemplation on Vishnu is superinduced on his images.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[342:1](sbe38266.htm#fr_210) I. e. whether Brahman is to be meditated upon as\n\xc3\x82ditya, or \xc3\x82ditya as Brahman.\n\n[342:2](sbe38266.htm#fr_211) While, as a matter of fact, scripture enjoins the\nmeditations.\n\n[342:3](sbe38266.htm#fr_212) It would serve no purpose to refer to limited\nthings, such as p. 343 the sun and so on, as being resolved into their causal\nsubstance, i.e. Brahman.
