Narada said :-- Thou, the Knower of everything! Describe about the\nremaining Dvipas, knowing which we will be highly delighted.\n\n\n\n2-36. Naraya _n_ a spoke thus :-- The very vast Ghrita Sagara (the ocean of\nclarified butter) is encircling the Kus\xc2\x92a Dvipa. Next to it is the Krau _n_\ncha Dvipa. It is twice as large as Kus\xc2\x92a. The K _s_ ira Sagara (the ocean of\nmilk) is surrounding this Dvipa. The Krau _n_ cha mountain is standing here.\nThe name of this Dvipa is derived from this mountain. In days gone by, the\nhighly intelligent Kartikeya burst this mountain by his own prowess. This\nDvipa is washed by the K _s_ ira Sagara; and Varu _n_ a is its Regent. The son\nof Priyavrata, Ghritapri _st_ ha, respected by all and whose prosperity knows\nno end, is the Lord of this Dvipa. He divided this Dvipa into the seven parts\nand distributed them to his sons and named the Var _s_ as after the names of\nhis sons. He made his sons the rulers of those places and he himself took the\nrefuge of the Bhagavan Naraya _n_ a The names of the seven Var _s_ as are\nrespectively :-- \xc3\x82ma, Madhuruha, Meghapri _st_ ha, Sudhamaka, Bhraji _st_ ha,\nLohitar _n_ a, and Vanaspati. O Narada! The seven mountains and the rivers\nthere are very celebrated throughout the worlds. The names of the mountains\nare :-- S\xc2\x92ukla, Vardhamana, Bhojana, Upavarha _n_ a, Nanda, Nandana, and\nSarvatobhadra. The names of the rivers are :-- Abhaya, Amritaugha, \xc3\x82ryaka,\nTirthavati, Vrittirupavati, S\xc2\x92ukla, and Pavitravatika. The inhabitants there\ndrink\n\n\n\np. 770\n\n\n\nthe highly pure water of these rivers. The people there are divided into four\ncolours Puru _s_ a, Ri _s_ abha, Dravi _n_ a, and Vedaka and they worship the\nBhagavan Varu _n_ a, of the form of water. Then they become very\ndiscriminative, and, with great devotion, and holding full within their folded\npalms the water, repeat the following mantra :-- \xc2\x93O Water! Thou art the\nessence Virya of the Person Bhagavana and Thou sanctifiest the Bhurloka,\nBhuvarloka, and Svarloka. Thou destroyest the sins of all. We all are touching\nit; purify our bodies.\xc2\x94 After finishing their mantrams, they sing various\nhymns to Varu _n_ a. Next to the K _s_ iroda Sagara, is the S\xc2\x92aka Dvipa,\nthirty two lakh yoyanas wide, surrounded by the Dadhi Sagara (the ocean of\ncurds), of similar dimensions. Here the most excellent tree named the S\xc2\x92aka\ntree exists. O Narada! The Dvipa is named so after the tree. Medhatithi, the\nson of Priyavrata is the Lord of this Dvipa. He divided this land into the\nseven Var _s_ as and distributed each to his seven sons respectively; and\nultimately he took refuge to the path of Yoga. The names of the seven Var _s_\nas are Purojava, Manojava, Pavamanaka, Dhumranika, Chitrarepha, Bahurupa, and\nVis\xc2\x92vadhrik. In these Var _s_ as there are seven mountains, one in each Var\n_s_ a, as forming their boundaries; and there are seven rivers also. The names\nof the mountains are :-- \xc3\x8es\xc2\x92ana, \xc3\x9brus\xc2\x92ri _n_ ga, Valabhadra, S\xc2\x92ata Kes\xc2\x92ara,\nSahasra-srotaka, Devapala, and Mahasana; the names of the rivers are :--\nAnagha, \xc3\x82yurda, Ubhayaspri _st_ i, Aparajita, Pa\xc3\xb1chapadi, and Sahasras\xc2\x92ruti\nand Nijadhriti. These seven rivers are all very big and resplendent with\nlustre. The people are divided into four classes :-- Var _s_ as, Satyavrata,\nKratuvrata, Danavrata, and A _n_ uvrata. They all take the Pra _n_ ayama\nexercise and thereby bring the Rajas, and Tamo Gu _n_ a under their subjection\nand they worship Hari, of the nature of Pra _n_ a Vayu, Higher than the\nHighest. Their mantra is this :-- \xc2\x93He has entered into all the living beings\nand nourishes them by the Pra _n_ a and other faculties; He is the Internal\nRuler of all and the Supreme Controller; this Universe is under His control;\nlet Him protect and nourish us.\xc2\x94 O Narada! Next to this Dadhi Sagara is Pu _s_\nkara Dvipa; it is twice as large as S\xc2\x92aka Dvipa. It is surrounded by the Dudha\nSagar (the ocean of milk) all twice as large. The leaves of Pu _s_ kara tree\nthat shines in the Pu _s_ kara Dvipa, are fiery like golden flames; they are\nas clean and pure. Crores and crores of leaves, golden in colour ornament this\nTree. Vasudeva, the Guru of all the Lokas, has created this Pu _s_ kara Dvipa\nas the seat of Parame _st_ hi Brahma, possessed of six extraordinary powers,\nfor the purpose of creation. There is one mountain in this Dvipa; it is\ndivided into two parts, named Arvachina and Parachina. These form the\nboundaries of the two Var _s_ as. The\n\n\n\np. 771\n\n\n\nmountain is one Ayuta Yoyana high and one Ayuta Yoyana wide. There are four\ncities on the four sides. Indra and the three other Lokapalas are the lords of\nthese cities. The Sun God comes out from their top and circumambulating Meru,\ngoes there again. The whole year is his Chakram, circle of circuit; His path\nis Uttraya _n_ am and Dak _s_ i _n_ aya _n_ am. Vitihotra, the son of\nPriyavrata is the lord of this island. He distributed the two Var _s_ as\namongst his two sons, Rama _n_ a and Dhataki. They rule over the two Var _s_\nas named also after them. Like the inhabitants of the above Var _s_ as, the\npeople also get powers of themselves and worship devotedly the God seated on\nthe lotus and follow such path of the Yoga as leads them to the Brahma\nSalokya, etc. The mantra runs thus :-- \xc2\x93We bow down to that One God, without a\nSecond, of the nature of Peace, Who is the Fruit of all the Karmas, Who is the\nseat of illumination of Brahma, Who is established in Unity, and Who is\nworshipped by all the Lokas.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nHere ends the Thirteenth Chapter of the Eighth Book on the description of the\nremaining Dvipas in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, of 18,000\nverses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 14](bk08ch14.htm)\n\n'
