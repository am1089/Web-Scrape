My son, good night!  \nFixt is to-morrow for the rite.'  \n\nThen Rama paid the reverence due,  \nAnd quickly to his home withdrew.  \nHe passed within, nor lingered there,  \nBut sought his mother's mansion, where  \nThe dame in linen robes arrayed  \nDevoutly in the chapel prayed  \nTo Fortune's Queen,with utterance checked,  \nThat she her Rama would protect.  \nThere was Sumitra too, and there  \nWas Lakshman led by loving care:  \nAnd when the royal choice they knew  \nSita in haste was summoned too.  \nAbsorbed, with half-shut eyes, the queen  \nAttended by the three was seen.  \nShe knew that Pushya's lucky hour  \nWould raise her son to royal power,  \nSo fixed with bated breath each thought  \nOn God supreme, by all men sought.  \nTo her, as thus she knelt and prayed,  \nRama drew near, due reverence paid,  \nAnd then to swell his mother's joy,  \nThus spoke her own beloved boy;  \n'O mother dear, my sire's decree  \nEntrusts the people's weal to me.  \nTo-morrow I, for so his will.  \nAnointed king, the throne shall fill.  \nThe few last hours till night shall end  \nSita with me must fasting spend,  \nFor so my father has decreed,  \nAnd holy priests with him agreed.  \nWhat vows soever thou mayst deem  \nMy consecration's eve beseem,  \nDo thou, sweet mother, for my sake  \nAnd for beloved Sita's make.'  \n\nWhen the glad news Kaus'alya heard,  \nSo long desired, so long deferred,  \nWhile tears of joy her utterance broke,  \nIn answer to her son she spoke:  \n'Long be thy life, my darling: now  \nThy prostrate foes before thee bow.  \nLive long and with thy bright success  \nMy friends and dear Sumitra's bless.  \nSurely the stars were wondrous fair  \nWhen thee, sweet son, thy mother bare,  \nThat thy good gifts such love inspire  \nAnd win the favour of thy sire.  \nWith thee I travailed not in vain;  \nThose lotus eyes reward my pain,  \nAnd all the glory of the line  \nOf old Ikshvaku will be thine.'  \n\nHe smiled, and on his brother gazed  \nWho sate with reverent hands upraised,  \nAnd said: 'My brother, thou must be  \nJoint-ruler of this land with me.  \nMy second self thou, Lakshman, art,  \nAnd in my fortune bearest part.  \nBe thine, Sumitra's son, to know  \nThe joys from regal power that flow.  \nMy life itself, the monarch's seat,  \nFor thy dear sake to me are sweet. [1](ry083.htm#fn_268)  \n\nThus Rama to his brother said,  \nTo both his mothers' bowed his head,  \nAnd then with Sita by his side  \nTo his own house the hero hied.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[93:1](ry082.htm#fr_265) Rahu, the ascending node, is in mythology a demon\nwith the tail of a dragon whose head was severed from his body by Vishnu, but\nbeing immortal, the head and tail retained their separate existence and being\ntransferred to the stellar sphere became the authors of eclipses; the first\nespecially by endeavouring to swallow the sun and moon.\n\n[93:2](ry082.htm#fr_266) In eclipse.\n\n[93:3](ry082.htm#fr_267) The seventh of the lunar asterisms.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto V.: Rama's Fast.](ry083.htm)\n\n"
