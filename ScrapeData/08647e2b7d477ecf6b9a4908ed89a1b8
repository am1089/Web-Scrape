In the beginning there was nothing (to be perceived)\n\np. 75\n\nhere whatsoever. By Death indeed all this was concealed,--by hunger; for death\nis hunger. Death (the first being) thought, 'Let me have a body.' Then he\nmoved about, worshipping. From him thus worshipping water was produced. And he\nsaid: 'Verily, there appeared to me, while I worshipped (ar _k_ ate), water\n(ka).' This is why water is called ar-ka 1. Surely there is water (or\npleasure) for him who thus knows the reason why water is called arka.\n\n2\\. Verily water is arka. And what was there as the froth of the water, that\nwas hardened, and became the earth. On that earth he (Death) rested, and from\nhim, thus resting and heated, Agni (Vira _g_ ) proceeded, full of light.\n\n3\\. That being divided itself threefold, \xc3\x82ditya (the sun) as the third, and\nVayu (the air) as the third 2. That spirit (pra _n_ a) 3 became threefold. The\nhead was the Eastern quarter, and the arms this and that quarter\n\np. 76\n\n[paragraph continues] (i. e. the N. E. and S. E., on the left and right\nsides). Then the tail was the Western quarter, and the two legs this and that\nquarter (i. e. the N. W. and S. W.) The sides were the Southern and Northern\nquarters, the back heaven, the belly the sky, the dust the earth. Thus he (M\n_ri_ tyu, as arka) stands firm in the water, and he who knows this stands firm\nwherever he goes.\n\n4\\. He desired 1, 'Let a second body be born of me,' and he (Death or Hunger)\nembraced Speech in his mind. Then the seed became the year. Before that time\nthere was no year. Speech 2 bore him so long as a year, and after that time\nsent him forth. Then when he was born, he (Death) opened his mouth, as if to\nswallow him. He cried Bha _n_! and that became speech 3.\n\n5\\. He thought, 'If I kill him, I shall have but little food.' He therefore\nbrought forth by that speech and by that body (the year) all whatsoever\nexists, the _Ri_ _k_ , the Ya _g_ us, the Saman, the metres, the sacrifices,\nmen, and animals.\n\nAnd whatever he (Death) brought forth, that he resolved to eat (ad). Verily\nbecause he eats everything, therefore is Aditi (Death) called Aditi. He who\nthus knows why Aditi is called Aditi, becomes an eater of everything, and\neverything becomes his food 4.\n\np. 77\n\n6\\. He desired to sacrifice again with a greater sacrifice. He toiled and\nperformed penance. And while he toiled and performed penance, glorious power 1\nwent out of him. Verily glorious power means the senses (pra _n_ a). Then when\nthe senses had gone out, the body took to swelling ( _s_ va-yitum), and mind\nwas in the body.\n\n7\\. He desired that this body should be fit for sacrifice (medhya), and that\nhe should be embodied by it. Then he became a horse (a _s_ va), because it\nswelled (a _s_ vat), and was fit for sacrifice (medhya); and this is why the\nhorse-sacrifice is called A _s_ va-medha.\n\nVerily he who knows him thus, knows the A _s_ vamedha. Then, letting the horse\nfree, he thought 2, and at the end of a year he offered it up for himself,\nwhile he gave up the (other) animals to the deities. Therefore the sacrificers\noffered up the purified horse belonging to Pra _g_ apati, (as dedicated) to\nall the deities.\n\nVerily the shining sun is the A _s_ vamedha-sacrifice, and his body is the\nyear; Agni is the sacrificial fire (arka), and these worlds are his bodies.\nThese two are the sacrificial fire and the A _s_ vamedha-sacrifice, and they\nare again one deity, viz. Death. He (who knows this) overcomes another death,\ndeath does not reach him, death is his Self, he becomes one of those deities.\n\np. 78\n\n### THIRD BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A 1.\n\n1\\. There were two kinds of descendants of Pra _g_ apati, the Devas and the\nAsuras 2. Now the Devas were indeed the younger, the Asuras the elder ones 3.\nThe Devas, who were struggling in these worlds, said: 'Well, let us overcome\nthe Asuras at the sacrifices (the _G_ yotish _t_ oma) by means of the\nudgitha.'\n\n2\\. They said to speech (Va _k_ ): 'Do thou sing out for us (the udgitha).'\n'Yes,' said speech, and sang (the udgitha). Whatever delight there is in\nspeech, that she obtained for the Devas by singing (the three pavamanas); but\nthat she pronounced well (in the other nine pavamanas), that was for herself.\nThe Asuras knew: 'Verily, through this singer they will overcome us.' They\ntherefore rushed at the singer and pierced her with evil. That evil which\nconsists in saying what is bad, that is that evil.\n\n3\\. Then they (the Devas) said to breath (scent): 'Do thou sing out for us.'\n'Yes,' said breath, and sang. Whatever delight there is in breath (smell),\nthat he obtained for the Devas by singing; but that he smelled well, that was\nfor himself. The Asuras knew: 'Verily, through this singer they will overcome\nus.' They therefore rushed at the singer, and\n\np. 79\n\npierced him with evil. That evil which consists in smelling what is bad, that\nis that evil.\n\n4\\. Then they said to the eye: 'Do thou sing out for us.' 'Yes,' said the eye,\nand sang. Whatever delight there is in the eye, that he obtained for the Devas\nby singing; but that he saw well, that was for himself The Asuras knew:\n'Verily, through this singer they will overcome us.' They therefore rushed at\nthe singer, and pierced him with evil. That evil which consists in seeing what\nis bad, that is that evil.\n\n5\\. Then they said to the ear: 'Do thou sing out for us.' 'Yes,' said the ear,\nand sang. Whatever delight there is in the ear, that he obtained for the Devas\nby singing; but that he heard well, that was for himself. The Asuras knew:\n'Verily, through this singer they will overcome us.' They therefore rushed at\nthe singer, and pierced him with evil. That evil which consists in hearing\nwhat is bad, that is that evil.\n\n6\\. Then they said to the mind: 'Do thou sing out for us.' 'Yes,' said the\nmind, and sang. Whatever delight there is in the mind, that he obtained for\nthe Devas by singing; but that he thought well, that was for himself. The\nAsuras knew: 'Verily, through this singer they will overcome us.' They\ntherefore rushed at the singer, and pierced him with evil. That evil which\nconsists in thinking what is bad, that is that evil.\n\nThus they overwhelmed these deities with evils, thus they pierced them with\nevil.\n\n7\\. Then they said to the breath in the mouth 1: 'Do thou sing for us.' 'Yes,'\nsaid the breath, and sang. The Asuras knew: 'Verily, through this singer\n\np. 80\n\nthey will overcome us.' They therefore rushed at him and pierced him with\nevil. Now as a ball of earth will be scattered when hitting a stone, thus they\nperished, scattered in all directions. Hence the Devas rose, the Asuras fell.\nHe who knows this, rises by his self, and the enemy who hates him falls.\n\n8\\. Then they (the Devas) said: 'Where was he then who thus stuck to us 1?' It\nwas (the breath) within the mouth (asye 'ntar 2), and therefore called Ayasya;\nhe was the sap (rasa) of the limbs (a\xe1\xb9\x85ga), and therefore called \xc3\x82\xe1\xb9\x85girasa.\n\n9\\. That deity was called Dur, because Death was far (duran) from it. From him\nwho knows this, Death is far off.\n\n10\\. That deity, after having taken away the evil of those deities, viz.\ndeath, sent it to where the end of the quarters of the earth is. There he\ndeposited their sins. Therefore let no one go to a man, let no one go to the\nend (of the quarters of the earth 3), that he may not meet there with evil,\nwith death.\n\n11\\. That deity, after having taken away the evil of those deities, viz.\ndeath, carried them beyond death.\n\n12\\. He carried speech across first. When speech had become freed from death,\nit became (what it had been before) Agni (fire). That Agni, after having\nstepped beyond death, shines.\n\n13\\. Then he carried breath (scent) across. When breath had become freed from\ndeath, it became\n\np. 81\n\n[paragraph continues] Vayu (air). That Vayu, after having stepped beyond\ndeath, blows.\n\n14\\. Then he carried the eye across. When the eye had become freed from death,\nit became \xc3\x82ditya (the sun). That \xc3\x82ditya, after having stepped beyond death,\nburns.\n\n15\\. Then he carried the ear across. When the ear had become freed from death,\nit became the quarters (space). These are our quarters (space), which have\nstepped beyond death.\n\n16\\. Then he carried the mind across. When the mind had become freed from\ndeath, it became the moon ( _K_ andramas). That moon, after having stepped\nbeyond death, shines. Thus does that deity carry him, who knows this, across\ndeath.\n\n17\\. Then breath (vital), by singing, obtained for himself eatable food. For\nwhatever food is eaten, is eaten by breath alone, and in it breath rests 1.\n\nThe Devas said: 'Verily, thus far, whatever food there is, thou hast by\nsinging acquired it for thyself. Now therefore give us a share in that food.'\nHe said: 'You there, enter into me.' They said Yes, and entered all into him.\nTherefore whatever food is eaten by breath, by it the other senses are\nsatisfied.\n\n18\\. If a man knows this, then his own relations come to him in the same\nmanner; he becomes their supporter, their chief leader, their strong ruler 2.\nAnd if ever anyone tries to oppose 3 one who is possessed of such knowledge\namong his own relatives, then he\n\np. 82\n\nwill not be able to support his own belongings. But he who follows the man who\nis possessed of such knowledge, and who with his permission wishes to support\nthose whom he has to support, he indeed will be able to support his own\nbelongings.\n\n19\\. He was called Ayasya \xc3\x82\xe1\xb9\x85girasa, for he is the sap (rasa) of the limbs\n(a\xe1\xb9\x85ga). Verily, breath is the sap of the limbs. Yes, breath is the sap of the\nlimbs. Therefore from whatever limb breath goes away, that limb withers, for\nbreath verily is the sap of the limbs.\n\n20\\. He (breath) is also B _ri_ haspati, for speech is B _ri_ hati ( _Ri_\ng-veda), and he is her lord; therefore he is B _ri_ haspati.\n\n2 1. He (breath) is also Brahma _n_ aspati, for speech is Brahman (Ya _g_ ur-\nveda), and he is her lord; therefore he is Brahma _n_ aspati.\n\nHe (breath) is also Saman (the Udgitha), for speech is Saman (Sama-veda), and\nthat is both speech (sa) and breath (ama) 1. This is why Saman is called\nSaman.\n\n22\\. Or because he is equal (sama) to a grub, equal to a gnat, equal to an\nelephant, equal to these three worlds, nay, equal to this universe, therefore\nhe is Saman. He who thus knows this Saman, obtains union and oneness with\nSaman.\n\n23\\. He (breath) is Udgitha 2. Breath verily is Ut, for by breath this\nuniverse is upheld (uttabdha); and speech is Githa, song. And because he is ut\nand githa, therefore he (breath) is Udgitha.\n\np. 83\n\n24\\. And thus Brahmadatta _K_ aikitaneya (the grandson of _K_ ikitana), while\ntaking Soma (ra _g_ an), said: 'May this Soma strike my head off, if Ayasya\n\xc3\x82\xe1\xb9\x85girasa sang another Udgitha than this. He sang it indeed as speech and\nbreath.'\n\n25\\. He who knows what is the property of this Saman, obtains property. Now\nverily its property is tone only. Therefore let a priest, who is going to\nperform the sacrificial work of a Sama-singer, desire that his voice may have\na good tone, and let him perform the sacrifice with a voice that is in good\ntone. Therefore people (who want a priest) for a sacrifice, look out for one\nwho possesses a good voice, as for one who possesses property. He who thus\nknows what is the property of that Saman, obtains property.\n\n26\\. He who knows what is the gold of that Saman, obtains gold. Now verily its\ngold. is tone only. He who thus knows what is the gold of that Saman, obtains\ngold.\n\n27\\. He who knows what is the support of that Saman, he is supported. Now\nverily its support is speech only. For, as supported in speech, that breath is\nsung as that Saman. Some say the support is in food.\n\nNext follows the Abhyaroha 1 (the ascension) of the Pavamana verses. Verily\nthe Prastot _ri_ begins to sing the Saman, and when he begins, then let him\n(the sacrificer) recite these (three Ya _g_ us-verses):\n\n'Lead me from the unreal to the real! Lead me\n\np. 84\n\nfrom darkness to light! Lead me from death to immortality!'\n\nNow when he says, 'Lead me from the unreal to the real,' the unreal is verily\ndeath, the real immortality. He therefore says, 'Lead me from death to\nimmortality, make me immortal.'\n\nWhen he says, 'Lead me from darkness to light,' darkness is verily death,\nlight immortality. He therefore says, 'Lead me from death to immortality, make\nme immortal.'\n\nWhen he says, 'Lead me from death to immortality,' there is nothing there, as\nit were, hidden (obscure, requiring explanation) 1.\n\n28\\. Next come the other Stotras with which the priest may obtain food for\nhimself by singing them. Therefore let the sacrificer, while these Stotras are\nbeing sung, ask for a boon, whatever desire he may desire. An Udgat _ri_\npriest who knows this obtains by his singing whatever desire he may desire\neither for himself or for the sacrificer. This (knowledge) indeed is called\nthe conqueror of the worlds. He who thus knows this Saman 2, for him there is\nno fear of his not being admitted to the worlds 3.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[74:6](sbe15054.htm#fr_255) Called the Agni-brahma _n_ a, and intended to\nteach the origin of p. 75 Agni, the fire, which is here used for the Horse-\nsacrifice. It is found in the _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a, Madhyandina- _s_ akha\nX, 6, 5, and there explained as a description of Hira _n_ yagarbha.\n\n[75:1](sbe15054.htm#fr_256) We ought to read arkasyarkatvam, as in Poley's\nedition, or ark-kasyarkkatvam, to make the etymology still clearer. The\ncommentator takes arka in the sense of fire, more especially the sacrificial\nfire employed at the Horse-sacrifice. It may be so, but the more natural\ninterpretation seems to me to take arka here as water, from which indirectly\nfire is produced. From water springs the earth; on that earth he (Mri _t_ yu\nor Pra _g_ apati) rested, and from him, while resting there, fire (Vira _g_ )\nwas produced. That fire assumed three forms, fire, sun, and air, and in that\nthreefold form it is called pra _n_ a, spirit.\n\n[75:2](sbe15054.htm#fr_257) As Agni, Vayu, and \xc3\x82ditya.\n\n[75:3](sbe15054.htm#fr_258) Here Agni (Vira _g_ ) is taken as representing the\nfire of the altar at the Horse-sacrifice, which is called Arka. The object of\nthe whole Brahma _n_ a was to show the origin and true character of that fire\n(arka).\n\n[76:1](sbe15054.htm#fr_259) He is the same as what was before called m _ri_\ntyu, death, who, after becoming self-conscious, produced water, earth, fire,\n&c. He now wishes for a second body, which is the year, or the annual\nsacrifice, the year being dependent on the sun (\xc3\x82ditya).\n\n[76:2](sbe15054.htm#fr_260) The commentator understands the father, instead of\nSpeech, the mother.\n\n[76:3](sbe15054.htm#fr_261) The interjectional theory.\n\n[76:4](sbe15054.htm#fr_262) All these are merely fanciful etymologies of a _s_\nvamedha and arka.\n\n[77:1](sbe15054.htm#fr_263) Or glory (senses) and power. Comm.\n\n[77:2](sbe15054.htm#fr_264) He considered himself as the horse. Roer.\n\n[78:1](sbe15054.htm#fr_265) Called the Udgitha-brahma _n_ a. In the\nMadhyandina- _s_ akha, the Upanishad, which consists of six adhyayas, begins\nwith this Brahma _n_ a (cf. Weber's edition, p. 104 7; Commentary, p. 1109).\n\n[78:2](sbe15054.htm#fr_266) The Devas and Asuras are explained by the\ncommentator as the senses, inclining either to sacred or to worldly objects,\nto good or evil.\n\n[78:3](sbe15054.htm#fr_267) According to the commentator, the Devas were the\nless numerous and less strong, the Asuras the more numerous and more powerful.\n\n[79:1](sbe15054.htm#fr_268) This is the chief or vital breath, sometimes\ncalled mukhya.\n\n[80:1](sbe15054.htm#fr_269) Asakta from sa _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ , to embrace; cf. Rig-veda\nI, 33, 3. Here it corresponds to the German anhanglich.\n\n[80:2](sbe15054.htm#fr_270) See Deussen, Vedanta, p. 359.\n\n[80:3](sbe15054.htm#fr_271) To distant people.\n\n[81:1](sbe15054.htm#fr_272) This is done by the last nine Pavamanas, while the\nfirst three were used for obtaining the reward common to all the pra _n_ as.\n\n[81:2](sbe15054.htm#fr_273) Here annada is well explained by anamayavin, and\nvyadhirahita, free from sickness, strong.\n\n[81:3](sbe15054.htm#fr_274) Read pratiprati _h_ ; see Poley, and Weber, p.\n1180.\n\n[82:1](sbe15054.htm#fr_275) Cf. _Kh_ and. Up. V, 2, 6.\n\n[82:2](sbe15054.htm#fr_276) Not used here in the sense of song or hymn, but as\nan act of worship connected with the Saman. Comm.\n\n[83:1](sbe15054.htm#fr_277) The ascension is a ceremony by which the performer\nreaches the gods, or becomes a god. It consists in the recitation of three Ya\n_g_ us, and is here enjoined to take place when the Prastotri priest begins to\nsing his hymn.\n\n[84:1](sbe15054.htm#fr_278) See Deussen, Vedanta, p. 86.\n\n[84:2](sbe15054.htm#fr_279) He knows that he is the Pra _n_ a, which Pra _n_ a\nis the Saman. That Pra _n_ a cannot be defeated by the Asuras, i.e. by the\nsenses which are addicted to evil; it is pure, and the five senses finding\nrefuge in him, recover there their original nature, fire, &c. The Pra _n_ a is\nthe Self of all things, also of speech ( _Ri_ g-ya _g_ u _h_ -samodgitha), and\nof the Saman that has to be sung and well sung. The Pra _n_ a pervades all\ncreatures, and he who identifies himself with that Pra _n_ a, obtains the\nrewards mentioned in the Brahma _n_ a. Comm.\n\n[84:3](sbe15054.htm#fr_280) In connection with loka _g_ it, lokyata is here\nexplained, and may probably have been intended, as worthiness to be admitted\nto the highest world. Originally lokyata and alokyata meant right and wrong.\nSee also I, 5, 17.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4](sbe15055.htm)\n\n"
