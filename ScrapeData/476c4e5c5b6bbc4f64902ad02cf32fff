Not in the symbol (is the Self to be contemplated); for he (the meditating\nperson) (may) not (view symbols as being the Self).\n\n'Let a man meditate on mind as Brahman; this is said with reference to the\nbody. Let a man meditate on ether as Brahman; this is said with reference to\nthe Devas' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 18, 1); '\xc3\x82ditya is Brahman, this is the doctrine'\n\np. 341\n\n[paragraph continues] ( _Kh_. Up. III, 19, 1); 'He who meditates on name as\nBrahman' ( _Kh_. Up. VII, 1, 5). With regard to these and similar meditations\non symbols a doubt arises whether the Self is to be apprehended in them also,\nor not.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that it is right to apprehend the Self in them also\nbecause Brahman is known from scriptural passages as the (universal) Self. For\nthose symbols also are of the nature of Brahman in so far as they are effects\nof it, and therefore are of the nature of the Self as well.\n\nWe must not, our reply runs, attach to symbols the idea of Brahman. For he,\ni.e. the meditating person, cannot comprehend the heterogeneous symbols as\nbeing of the nature of the Self.--Nor is it true that the symbols are of the\nnature of the Self, because as being effects of Brahman they are of the nature\nof Brahman; for (from their being of the nature of Brahman) there results the\nnon-existence of (them as) symbols. For the aggregate of names and so on can\nbe viewed as of the nature of Brahman only in so far as the individual\ncharacter of those effects of Brahman is sublated; and when that character is\nsublated how then can they be viewed as symbols, and how can the Self be\napprehended in them? Nor does it follow from the fact of Brahman being the\nSelf that a contemplation of the Self can be established on the ground of\ntexts teaching a contemplation on Brahman (in certain symbols), since a\ncontemplation of the latter kind does not do away with agentship and the like.\nFor the instruction that Brahman is the Self depends on the doing away with\nagentship and all other characteristics of transmigratory existence; the\ninjunction of meditations, on the other hand, depends on the non-removal of\nthose characteristics. Hence we cannot establish the apprehension of the Self\n(in the symbols) on the ground of the meditating person being the same as the\nsymbols. For golden ornaments and figures made of gold are not identical with\neach other, but only in so far as gold constitutes the Self of both. And that\nfrom that oneness (of symbol and meditating person) which depends on Brahman\nbeing the Self of all there results non-existence of the symbols (and hence\nimpossibility of the meditations\n\np. 342\n\nenjoined), we have explained above.--For these reasons the Self is not\ncontemplated in symbols.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 1, 5](sbe38266.htm)\n\n"
