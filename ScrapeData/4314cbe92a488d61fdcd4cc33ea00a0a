XVIII.\n\nBuddha goes to the earth, and teaches the Daityas to contemn the Vedas: his\nsceptical doctrines: his prohibition of animal sacrifices. Meaning of the term\nBauddha. Jainas and Bauddhas; their tenets. The Daityas lose their power, and\nare overcome by the gods. Meaning of the term Nagna. Consequences of neglect\nof duty. Story of \xc5\x9aatadhanu and his wife \xc5\x9aaivya. Communion with heretics to be\nshunned.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--After this, the great delusion, having proceeded to earth, beheld\nthe Daityas engaged in ascetic penances upon the banks of the Narmada river 1;\nand approaching them in the semblance of a naked mendicant, with his head\nshaven, and carrying a bunch of peacock\'s feathers 2, he thus addressed them\nin gentle accents: "Ho, lords of the Daitya race! wherefor is it that you\npractise these acts of penance? is it with a view to recompense in this world,\nor in another?" "Sage," replied the Daityas, "we pursue these devotions to\nobtain a reward hereafter; why should you make such an inquiry?" "If you are\ndesirous of final emancipation," answered the seeming ascetic, "attend to my\nwords, for you are worthy of a revelation which is the door to ultimate\nfelicity. The duties that I will teach you are the secret path to liberation;\nthere are none beyond or superior to them: by following them you shall obtain\neither heaven or exemption from future existence. You, mighty beings, are\ndeserving of such lofty doctrine." By such persuasions, and by many specious\narguments, did this delusive being mislead the Daityas from the tenets of the\nVedas; teaching that the same thing might be for the sake of virtue and of\nvice; might be, and might not be; might or might not contribute to liberation;\nmight be the\n\np. 339\n\nsupreme object, and not the supreme object; might be effect, and not be\neffect; might be manifest, or not be manifest; might be the duty of those who\ngo naked, or who go clothed in much raiment: and so the Daityas were seduced\nfrom their proper duties by the repeated lessons of their illusory preceptor,\nmaintaining the equal truth of contradictory tenets 3; and they were called\nArhatas 4, from the phrase he had employed of "Ye are worthy (Arhatha) of this\ngreat doctrine;" that is, of the false doctrines which he persuaded them to\nembrace.\n\nThe foes of the gods being thus induced to apostatize from the religion of the\nVedas, by the delusive person sent by Vishn\xcc\x81u, became in their turn teachers\nof the same heresies, and perverted others; and these, again, communicating\ntheir principles to others, by whom they were still further disseminated, the\nVedas were in a short time deserted by most of the Daitya race. Then the same\ndeluder, putting on garments of a red colour, assuming a benevolent aspect,\nand speaking in soft and agreeable tones, addressed others of the same family,\nand said to them, "If; mighty demons, you cherish a desire either for heaven\nor for final repose, desist from the iniquitous massacre of animals (for\nsacrifice), and hear from me what you should do. Know that all that exists is\ncomposed of discriminative knowledge. Understand my words, for they have been\nuttered by the wise. This world subsists without support, and engaged in the\npursuit of error, which it mistakes for knowledge, as well as vitiated by\npassion and the rest, revolves in the straits of existence." In this manner,\nexclaiming to them, "Know!" (Budhyadwam), and they replying, "It is known"\n(Budhyate), these Daityas were induced by the\n\np. 340\n\narch deceiver to deviate from their religious duties (and become Bauddhas), by\nhis repeated arguments and variously urged persuasions 5, When they had\nabandoned their own faith, they persuaded others to do the same, and the\nheresy spread, and many deserted the practices enjoined by the Vedas and the\nlaws.\n\nThe delusions of the false teacher paused not with the conversion of the\nDaityas to the Jaina and Bauddha heresies, but with various erroneous tenets\nhe prevailed upon others to apostatize, until the whole were led astray, and\ndeserted the doctrines and observances inculcated by the three Vedas. Some\nthen spake evil of the sacred books; some blasphemed the gods; some treated\nsacrifices and other devotional ceremonies with scorn; and others calumniated\nthe Brahmans. "The precepts," they cried, "that lead to the injury of animal\nlife (as in sacrifices) are highly reprehensible. To say that casting butter\ninto flame is productive of reward, is mere childishness. If Indra, after\nhaving obtained godhead by multiplied rites, is fed upon the wood used as fuel\nin holy fire, he is lower than a brute, which feeds at least upon leaves. If\nan animal slaughtered in religious worship is thereby raised to heaven, would\nit not be expedient for a man who institutes a sacrifice to kill his own\nfather for a victim? If that which is eaten by one at a \xc5\x9araddha gives\nsatisfaction to another, it must be unnecessary for one who resides at a\ndistance to bring food for presentation in person 6." "First, then, let it be\ndetermined what may be (rationally) believed by mankind, and then," said their\npreceptor, "you will find that felicity may be expected from my instructions.\nThe words of authority do not, mighty Asuras, fall from heaven: the text that\nhas reason is alone to be acknowledged by me, and by such as you are 7." By\nsuch and similar\n\np. 341\n\nlessons the Daityas were perverted, so that not one of them admitted the\nauthority of the Vedas.\n\nWhen the Daityas had thus declined from the path of the holy writings, the\ndeities took courage, and gathered together for battle. Hostilities\naccordingly were renewed, but the demons were now defeated and slain by the\ngods, who had adhered to the righteous path. The armour of religion, which had\nformerly protected the Daityas, had been discarded by them, and upon its\nabandonment followed their destruction 8.\n\nThus, Maitreya, you are to understand that those who have seceded from their\noriginal belief are said to be naked, because they have thrown off the garment\nof the Vedas. According to the law there are four conditions or orders of men\n(of the three first castes), the religious student, the householder, the\nhermit, and the mendicant. There is no fifth state; and the unrighteous man\nwho relinquishes the order of the householder, and does not become either an\nanchoret or a mendicant, is also a naked (seceder). The man who neglects his\npermanent observances for one day and night, being able to perform them,\nincurs thereby sin for one day; and should he omit them, not being in trouble,\nfor a fortnight, he can be purified only by arduous expiation. The virtuous\nmust stop to gaze upon the sun after looking upon a person who has allowed a\nyear to elapse without the observance of the perpetual ceremonies; and they\nmust bathe with their clothes on should they have touched him: but for the\nindividual himself no expiation has been declared. There is no sinner upon\nearth more culpable than one in whose dwelling the gods, progenitors, and\nspirits, are left to sigh unworshipped. Let not a man associate, in residence,\nsitting, or society, with him whose person or whose house has been blasted by\nthe sighs of the gods, progenitors, and spirits. Conversation, interchange of\ncivilities, or association with a man who for a twelvemonth has not discharged\nhis\n\np. 342\n\nreligious duties, is productive of equality of guilt; and the person who eats\nin the house of such a man, or sits down with him, or sleeps on the same couch\nwith him, becomes like him instantaneously. Again; he who takes his food\nwithout shewing reverence to the gods, progenitors, spirits, and guests,\ncommits sin. How great is his sin! The Brahmans, and men of the other castes,\nwho turn their faces away from their proper duties, become heretics, and are\nclassed with those who relinquish pious works. Remaining in a place where\nthere is too great an intermixture of the four castes is detrimental to the\ncharacter of the righteous. Men fall into hell who converse with one who takes\nhis food without offering a portion to the gods, the sages, the manes,\nspirits, and guests. Let therefore a prudent person carefully avoid the\nconversation, or the contact, and the like, of those heretics who are rendered\nimpure by their desertion of the three Vedas. The ancestral rite, although\nperformed with zeal and faith, pleases neither gods nor progenitors if it be\nlooked upon by apostates.\n\nIt is related that there was formerly a king named \xc5\x9aatadhanu, whose wife\n\xc5\x9aaivya was a woman of great virtue. She was devoted to her husband,\nbenevolent, sincere, pure, adorned with every female excellence, with\nhumility, and discretion. The Raja and his wife daily worshipped the god of\ngods, Janarddana, with pious meditations, oblations to fire, prayers, gifts,\nfasting, and every other mark of entire faith, and exclusive devotion. On one\noccasion, when they had fasted on the full moon of Kartika, and had bathed in\nthe Bhagirathi, they beheld, as they came up from the water, a heretic\napproach them, who was the friend of the Raja\'s military preceptor. The Raja,\nout of respect to the latter, entered into conversation with the heretic; but\nnot so did the princess; reflecting that she was observing a fast, she turned\nfrom him, and cast her eyes up to the sun. On their arrival at home, the\nhusband and wife, as usual, performed the worship of Vishn\xcc\x81u, agreeably to the\nritual. After a time the Raja, triumphant over his enemies, died; and the\nprincess ascended the funeral pile of her husband.\n\nIn consequence of the fault committed by \xc5\x9aatadhanu, by speaking to an infidel\nwhen he was engaged in a solemn fast, he was born again as a\n\np. 343\n\ndog. His wife was born as the daughter of the Raja of Ka\xc5\x9bi, with a knowledge\nof the events of her preexistence, accomplished in every science, and endowed\nwith every virtue. Her father was anxious to give her in marriage to some\nsuitable husband, but she constantly opposed his design, and the king was\nprevented by her from accomplishing her nuptials. With the eye of divine\nintelligence she knew that her own husband had been regenerate as a dog, and\ngoing once to the city of Vaidi\xc5\x9ba she saw the dog, and recognised her former\nlord in him. Knowing that the animal was her husband, she placed upon his neck\nthe bridal garland, accompanying it with the marriage rites and prayers: but\nhe, eating the delicate food presented to him, expressed his delight after the\nfashion of his species; at which she was much ashamed, and, bowing reverently\nto him, thus spake to her degraded spouse: "Recall to memory, illustrious\nprince, the ill-timed politeness on account of which you have been born as a\ndog, and are now fawning upon me. In consequence of speaking to a heretic,\nafter bathing in a sacred river, you have been condemned to this abject birth.\nDo you not remember it?" Thus reminded, the Raja recollected his former\ncondition, and was lost in thought, and felt deep humiliation. With a broken\nspirit he went forth from the city, and falling dead in the desert, was born\nanew as a jackal. In the course of the following year the princess knew what\nhad happened, and went to the mountain Kolahala to seek for her husband.\nFinding him there, the lovely daughter of the king of the earth said to her\nlord, thus disguised as a jackal, "Dost thou not remember, oh king, the\ncircumstance of conversing with a heretic, which I called to thy recollection\nwhen thou wast a dog?" The Raja, thus addressed, knew that what the princess\nhad spoken was true, and thereupon desisted from food, and died. He then\nbecame a wolf; but his blameless wife knew it, and came to him in the lonely\nforest, and awakened his remembrance of his original state. "No wolf art\nthou," she said, "but the illustrious sovereign \xc5\x9aatadhanu. Thou wast then a\ndog, then a jackal, and art now a wolf." Upon this, recollecting himself, the\nprince abandoned his life, and became a vulture; in which form his lovely\nqueen still found him, and aroused him to a knowledge of the past. "Prince,"\n\np. 344\n\nshe exclaimed, "recollect yourself: away with this uncouth form, to which the\nsin of conversing with a heretic has condemned you!" The Raja was next born as\na crow; when the princess, who through her mystical powers was aware of it,\nsaid to him, "Thou art now thyself the eater of tributary grain, to whom, in a\nprior existence, all the kings of the earth paid tribute 9." Having abandoned\nhis body, in consequence of the recollections excited by these words, the king\nnext became a peacock, which the princess took to herself, and petted, and fed\nconstantly with such food as is agreeable to birds of its class. The king of\nKa\xc5\x9bi instituted at that time the solemn sacrifice of a horse. In the ablutions\nwith which it terminated the princess caused her peacock to be bathed, bathing\nalso herself; and she then reminded \xc5\x9aatadhanu how he had been successively\nborn as various animals. On recollecting this, he resigned his life. He was\nthen born as the son of a person of distinction; and the princess now\nassenting to the wishes of her father to see her wedded, the king of Ka\xc5\x9bi\ncaused it to be made known that she would elect a bridegroom from those who\nshould present themselves as suitors for her hand. When the election took\nplace, the princess made choice of her former lord, who appeared amongst the\ncandidates, and again invested him with the character of her husband. They\nlived happily together, and upon her father\'s decease \xc5\x9aatadhanu ruled over the\ncountry of Videha. He offered many sacrifices, and gave away many gifts, and\nbegot sons, and subdued his enemies in war; and having duly exercised the\nsovereign power, and cherished benignantly the earth, he died, as became his\nwarrior birth, in battle. His queen again followed him in death, and,\nconformably to sacred precepts, once more mounted cheerfully his funeral pile.\nThe king then, along with his princess, ascended beyond the sphere of Indra to\nthe regions where all desires are for ever gratified, obtaining ever-during\nand unequalled happiness in heaven, the perfect felicity that is the rarely\nrealised reward of conjugal fidelity 10.\n\np. 345\n\nSuch, Maitreya, is the sin of conversing with a heretic, and such are the\nexpiatory effects of bathing after the solemn sacrifice of a horse, as I have\nnarrated them to you. Let therefore a man carefully avoid the discourse or\ncontact of an unbeliever, especially at seasons of devotion, and when engaged\nin the performance of religious rites preparatory to a sacrifice. If it be\nnecessary that a wise man should look at the sun, after beholding one who has\nneglected his domestic ceremonies for a month, how much greater need must\nthere be of expiation after encountering one who has wholly abandoned the\nVedas? one who is supported by infidels, or who disputes the doctrines of holy\nwrit? Let not a person treat with even the civility of speech, heretics, those\nwho do forbidden acts, pretended saints, scoundrels, sceptics 11, and\nhypocrites. Intercourse with such iniquitous wretches, even at a distance, all\nassociation with schismatics, defiles; let a man therefore carefully avoid\nthem.\n\nThese, Maitreya, are the persons called naked, the meaning of which term you\ndesired to have explained. Their very looks vitiate the performance of an\nancestral oblation; speaking to then destroys religious merit for a whole day.\nThese are the unrighteous heretics to whom a man must not give shelter, and\nspeaking to whom effaces whatever merit he may that day have obtained. Men,\nindeed, fall into hell as the consequence of only conversing with those who\nunprofitably assume the twisted hair, and shaven crown; with those who feed\nwithout offering food to gods, spirits, and guests; and those who are excluded\nfrom the presentation of cakes, and libations of water, to the manes.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[338:1](vp092.htm#fr_905) The situation chosen for the first appearance of the\nheresy agrees well enough with the great prevalence of the Jain faith in the\nwest of India in the eleventh and twelfth centuries (As. Res. XVI. 318), or\nperhaps a century earlier, and is a circumstance of some weight in\ninvestigating the date of the Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a.\n\n[338:2](vp092.htm#fr_906) A bunch of peacock\'s feathers is still an ordinary\naccompaniment of a Jain mendicant. According to the Hindi poem, the Prithu Rai\nCharitra, it was borne by the Buddhist Amara Sinha; but that work is not,\nperhaps, very good authority for Bauddha observances, at least of an ancient\ndate.\n\n[339:3](vp092.htm#fr_907) In this and the preceding contradictions it is\nprobable that the writer refers, although not with much precision, to the\nsceptical tenets of the Jainas, whence they are called commonly Syadvadis,\nassertors of probabilities, or of what may be. These usually form seven\ncategories, or, 1. a thing is; 2. it is not; 3. it is, and it is not; 4. it is\nnot definable; 5. it is, but is not definable; 6. it is not, neither is it\ndefinable; 7. it is, and it is not, and is not definable. Hence the Jains are\nalso termed Saptavadis and Saptabhangis, assertors and oppugners of seven\npropositions. As. Res. XVII. 271; and Trans. Royal As. Soc. I. 555.\n\n[339:4](vp092.htm#fr_908) Here is farther confirmation of the Jains being\nintended by our text, as the term Arhat is more particularly applied to them,\nalthough it is also used by the Buddhists.\n\n[340:5](vp092.htm#fr_909) We have therefore the Bauddhas noticed as a distinct\nset. If the author wrote from a personal knowledge of Buddhists in India, he\ncould not have written much later than the 10th or 11th century.\n\n[340:6](vp092.htm#fr_910) That is, according to the commentator, a \xc5\x9araddha may\nbe performed for a man who is abroad by any of his kinsmen who are tarrying at\nhome; it will be of equal benefit to him as if he offered it himself; he will\nequally eat of the consecrated food.\n\n[340:7](vp092.htm#fr_911) We have in these passages, no doubt, allusion to the\nVarhaspatyas, or followers of Vrihaspati, who seem to have been numerous and\nbold at some period anterior to the 14th century. As. Res. XVI. 5.\n\n[341:8](vp092.htm#fr_912) We may have in this conflict of the orthodox\ndivinities and heretical Daityas some covert allusion to political troubles,\ngrowing out of religious differences, and the final predominance of\nBrahmanism. Such occurrences seem to have preceded the invasion of India by\nthe Mohammedans, and prepared the way for their victories.\n\n[344:9](vp092.htm#fr_913) There is a play upon the word Bali, which means\n\'tribute,\' or \'fragments of a meal scattered abroad to the birds,\' &c.\n\n[344:10](vp092.htm#fr_914) The legend is peculiar to the Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a,\nalthough the doctrine it inculcates is to be found elsewhere.\n\n[345:11](vp092.htm#fr_915) Haitukas, \'causalists;\' either the followers of the\nNyaya or \'logical\' philosophy, or Bauddhas, those who take nothing upon\nauthority, and admit nothing that cannot be proved; or it is explained, those\nwho by argument cast a doubt upon the efficacy of acts of devotion.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter I](vp093.htm)\n\n'
