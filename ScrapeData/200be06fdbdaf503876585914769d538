Having\n(thus) poured (the water over his hands) he should with his (own) hand seize\nhis (i.e. the student's) hand together with the thumb, with (the formula), 'By\nthe impulse of the god Savit _ri_ , with the arms of the two A _s_ vins, with\nPushan's hands I seize thy hand, N.N.!'\n\n5\\.

He should cause him to look at the sun while the teacher says, 'God Savit\n_ri_ , this is thy Brahma _k_ arin; protect him; may he not die.'\n\np. 189\n\n8\\. (And further the teacher says), 'Whose Brahma _k_ arin art thou? The\nbreath's Brahma _k_ arin art thou. Who does initiate thee, and whom (does he\ninitiate)?

With the half verse, 'A youth, well attired, dressed came hither' (Rig-\nveda III, 8, 4) he should cause him to turn round from the left to the right.\n\n10\\.

Naraya _n_ a here\nhas the following remarks, which I can scarcely believe to express the real\nmeaning of this Sutra: 'Here the wiping of the ground round the fire is out of\nplace, because the Sa _m_ skaras for the fire have already been performed. As\nto that, it should be observed that the wiping is mentioned here in order\nthat, when fuel is put on the fire in the evening and in the morning, the\nsprinkling of water and the wiping may be performed. But on this occasion (at\nthe Upanayana) the student does not perform the wiping, &c., and silently puts\na piece of wood on that fire.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 21](sbe29120.htm)\n\n"
