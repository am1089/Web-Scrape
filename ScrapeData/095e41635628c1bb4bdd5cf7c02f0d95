Kesee and Byomasoor were killed\non the eleventh of the dark part of the month of Kartik; and early in the\nmorning of the thirteenth, Akroor obtained permission from Kuns to set out,\nand when he had ascended his chariot, these thoughts passed in his mind on his\nroad to Brindabun: "What prayers, devotion, sacrifice, offering, pilgrimage or\nfast have I performed, by virtue of which I have obtained this great benefit?\nTo my knowledge I have not once during my present birth mentioned the name of\nHuri, but have constantly remained in the retinue of Kuns; how shall I obtain\na knowledge of the mysteries of his adoration? (of the manner in which I am to\noffer adoration to him) I must certainly have performed some very virtuous act\nin a former birth, the excellence and glory of which have procured me this\nvery great advantage, that Kuns has sent me to bring Shree Krishnu Chund, the\nroot of joy. By going and obtaining a sight of him, I shall obtain the\ngreatest happiness my present birth can afford; (literally, I shall make my\nbirth fruitful.) I will fall at his feet with joined hands; and afterwards put\nthe dust of his feet on my head. The feet, which have come to\n\np. 134\n\ndestroy crime! and which Shree Bruhmu and the other gods worship. The feet,\nwhich fell on Kalee\'s head; and which are filled with the milk of the breast,\nand the perfume of sandal, which danced beautifully amidst the festivities,\nand the assemblage of the cowherdesses; and after which the cows roamed. The\nfeet, by the dust of which the wife of Guotumu was saved, from which the\nGanges issued forth, having deceived the Raja Buli, they performed an\nimportant act for Indru. Those feet I shall see to-day: the omens are\npropitious to me, herds of deer are running on the right." O great king! with\nthese thoughts in his mind, Akroor said again to himself, "I hope they will\nnot any of them look upon me as the ambassador of Kuns." Again it occurred to\nhim, "That he, whose name is acquainted with the secrets of the heart,\nrequires the true affection of the mind, and can recognize friends and enemies\n--he will never look upon me as Kuns\' ambassador; moreover on seeing me, he\nwill embrace me with kindness, and place his soft, lotus-like hand on my head,\nthen by gazing fixedly on his moon-like body, on which body Bruhmu, Roodru,\nIndru and all the gods constantly meditate, I will feast my eyes, in the way\nthe red partridge is delighted by gazing at the moon."\n\nHaving recited so much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja\nPureechit,--O great king! occupied with these thoughts, and driving his\nchariot along, Akroor Jee proceeded on his journey, and Krishnu and Buldeo\nwere coming in an opposite direction, after having taken the cows to pasture;\nand the two parties met outside Brindabun. On beholding the brilliance of\nHuri, from a distance, Akroor dismounted from his ruth, and running fell at\nhis feet in great agitation of mind, and was so overjoyed, that he could not\nspeak, and through excess of joy began to shed tears.\n\nShree Krishnu lifted him up, and embracing him with the greatest affection,\nlaid hold of his hand, and brought him to his house. Nund Rae, on seeing\nAkroor there, was delighted, and\n\np. 135\n\nrose up to meet him; and having treated him with very great respect, and\nwashed his feet, placed him upon a seat.\n\nThe attendants brought oil, and bathed him, after having rubbed his body with\nperfumed paste, and anointed it with sweet scents. Jusodha gave him a square\nplace to cook upon, and a board to sit upon, and prepared all sorts of\ndelicacies for him to eat. When he had rinsed his mouth after eating, and sat\ndown to eat pawn, Nund Jee made enquiries regarding his health and welfare,\nand said, "Amongst the members of Judoo\'s family, you are esteemed very\nvirtuous, and always maintain the dignity of your character. Explain to us,\nhow you fare with the demon Kuns, and what is the condition of people in that\nquarter, speak without any reserve?"\n\nAkroor Jee said, "From the time Kuns has come to the city of Muthoora, he has\ncaused affliction to all. You ask after the welfare of the city: the\ninhabitants suffer great distress. How can any of the family of Judoo escape,\nso long as Kuns remains at Muttra? As the hunter is an enemy to beasts, rams\nand goats, Kuns is an enemy to his subjects; every one suffers." Akroor added,\n"You are well aware of Kuns\' proceedings; what more need I say about them?"\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XL](psa41.htm)\n\n'
