Prayer at the building of a house.\n\n1\\. Right here do I erect a firm house: may it stand upon a (good) foundation,\ndripping with ghee! Thee may we inhabit, O house, with heroes all, with strong\nheroes, with uninjured heroes!  \n2\\. Right here, do thou, O house, stand firmly, full of horses, full of\ncattle, full of abundance! Full of sap, ful.] of ghee, full of milk, elevate\nthyself unto great happiness!  \n3\\. A supporter art thou, O house, with broad roof, containing purified grain!\nTo thee may the calf come, to thee the child, to thee the milch-cows, when\nthey return in the evening!  \n4\\. May Savitar, Vayu, Indra, Brihaspati cunningly erect this house! Alay the\nAlaruts sprinkle it with moisture and with ghee; may king Bhaga let our\nploughing take root!  \n5\\. O mistress of dwelling, as a sheltering and kindly goddess thou wast\nerected by the gods in the bealrinina; clothed in grass, be thou kindly\ndisposed; give us, moreover, wealth along with heroes!  \n6\\. Do thou, O cross-beam, according to regulation ascend the post, do thou,\nmightily ruling, hold off the enemies! May they that approach thee reverently,\nO house, not suffer injury, may we with all our heroes live a hundred autumns!  \n7\\. Hither to this (house) hath come the tender child, hither the calf along\nwith (the other) domestic animals; hither the vessel (full) of liquor,\ntogether with bowls of sour milk!  \n8\\. Carry forth, O woman, this full jar, a stream of ghee mixed with ambrosia!\nDo thou these drinkers supply with ambrosia; the sacrifice and the gifts (to\nthe Brahmans) shall it (the house) protect!  \n9\\. These waters, free from disease, destructive of disease, do I carry forth.\nThe chambers do I enter in upon together with the immortal Agni (fire).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 142.
