I come to you with this adoration, with a hymn I implore the favour\n[1](sbe3231.htm#an_1:171:1:1) of the quick (Maruts). O Maruts, you have\nrejoiced [2](sbe3231.htm#an_1:171:1:2) in it clearly\n[3](sbe3231.htm#an_1:171:1:3), put down then all anger and unharness your\nhorses!\n\n2\\. This reverent praise of yours, O Maruts, fashioned in the heart, has been\noffered by the mind [1](sbe3231.htm#an_1:171:2:1), O gods! Come to it, pleased\nin your mind, for you give increase to (our) worship\n[2](sbe3231.htm#an_1:171:2:2).\n\n3\\. May the Maruts when they have been praised be gracious to us, and likewise\nMaghavat (Indra), the best giver of happiness, when he has been praised. May\nour trees (our lances) [1](sbe3231.htm#an_1:171:3:1) through our valour stand\nalways erect, O Maruts!\n\n4\\. I am afraid of this powerful one, and trembling in fear of Indra. For you\nthe offerings were prepared,--we have now put them away, forgive us!\n\n5\\. Thou through whom the Manas [1](sbe3231.htm#an_1:171:5:1) see the\nmornings, whenever the eternal dawns flash forth with power\n[2](sbe3231.htm#an_1:171:5:2), O Indra, O strong hero, grant thou glory to us\nwith the Maruts, terrible with the terrible ones, strong and a giver of\nvictory.\n\n6\\. O Indra, protect thou these bravest of men [1](sbe3231.htm#an_1:171:6:1)\n(the Maruts), let thy anger be turned away [2](sbe3231.htm#an_1:171:6:2) from\nthe Maruts, for thou hast become [3](sbe3231.htm#an_1:171:6:3) victorious\ntogether with those brilliant heroes. May we have an invigorating autumn, with\nquickening rain!\n\np. 290\n\n##### NOTES.\n\nThe Anukrama _n_ i assigns verses 1 and 2 to the Maruts, the rest to Indra\nMarutvat. The poet is again Agastya. The whole hymn corresponds to the\nsituation as described in the preceding hymns, and leads on to a kind of\ncompromise between the Maruts, who seem really the favourite gods of the poet,\nand Indra, an irresistible and supreme deity whose claims cannot be\ndisregarded.\n\nNone of the verses of this hymn occurs in SV., VS., TS., AV.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Sumati here means clearly favour, as in I, 73, 6, 7; while in I, 166,\n6 it means equally clearly prayer.\n\nNote 2. Ludwig takes rara _n_ ata as referring to suktena and namasa. The\naccent of rara _n_ ata is irregular, and likewise the retaining of the final\nlong a in the Pada text. Otherwise the form is perfectly regular, namely the 2\np. plural of the reduplicated aorist, or the so-called aorist of the causative\na. Pa _n_ ini (VII, 4, 2, 3) gives a number of verbs which form that aorist as\n\xcc\x86  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84, and not as  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86 e. g. a _s_ a _s_ asat, not a _s_ i _s_ asat;\nababadhat, ayaya _k_ at, &c. Some verbs may take both forms, e. g. abibhra _g_\nat and ababhra _g_ at. This option applies to all Ka _n_ yadi verbs, and one\nof these is ra _n_ , which therefore at the time of Katyayana was supposed to\nhave formed its reduplicated aorist both as arara _n_ at and as arira _n_ at.\nWithout the augment we expect ri\xc2\xb4ra _n_ ata or rara _n_ ata. The question is\nwhy the final a should have been lengthened not only in the Sa _m_ hita, that\nwould be explicable, but in the Pada text also. The conjunctive of the perfect\nwould be rara _n_ ata. See also Delbruck, Verbum, p. 111.\n\nNote 3. Vedyabhis, which Ludwig translates here by um dessentwillen, was ihr\nerfaren sollt, I have translated by clearly, though tentatively only.\n\np. 291\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. The same idea is expressed in X, 47, 7. h _ri_ dispri _s_ a _h_ manasa\nva _k_ yamana _h_.\n\nNote 2. Namasa _h_ v _ri_ dha\xc2\xb4sa _h_ is intended to convey the idea that the\nMaruts increase or bless those who worship them.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. The second line has given rise to various interpretations.\n\nGrassmann:\n\nUns mogen aufrecht stehn wie schone Baume  \nNach unsrem Wunsch, O Maruts, alle Tage.\n\nLudwig: Hoch mogen sein unsere kampfenden lanzen, alle tage, O Marut,\nsigesstreben.\n\nAs komya never occurs again, it must for the present be left unexplained.\n\nThere was another difficult passage, I, 88, 3. medha\xc2\xb4 vana na k _ri_ _n_\navante urdhva, which I translated, 'May the Maruts stir up our minds as they\nstir up the forests.' I pointed out there that urdhva means not only upright,\nbut straight and strong (I, 172, 3; II, 30, 3), and I conjectured that the\nerect trees might have been used as a symbol of strength and triumph. Vana,\nhowever, may have been used poetically for anything made of wood, just as cow\nis used for leather or anything made of leather. In that case vana might be\nmeant for the wooden walls of houses, or even for lances (like \xce\xb4\xce\xbf\xe1\xbd\xbb\xcf\x81\xce\xb1\xcf\x84\xce\xb1 from\n\xce\xb4\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x81\xcf\x85 = Sk. daru), and the adjective would probably have to determine the true\nmeaning. If connected with komala it might have the same meaning as \xce\xb5\xe1\xbd\x90\xce\xbe\xce\xb5\xcf\x83\xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x82.\n\nProf. Oldenberg suggests that vanani may be meant for the wooden vessels\ncontaining the Soma.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. The Manas are the people of Manya, see I, 165, 15, note 1, and there\nis no necessity for taking mana, with Grassmann, as a general name for poet\n(Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. xvi, p. 174).\n\np. 292\n\nNote 2. It is doubtful to which word _s_ avasa belongs.\n\nI take it to be used adverbially with vyush _t_ ishu.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. We might also translate, 'protect men from the stronger one,' as we\nread I, 120, 4. patam _k_ a sahyasa _h_ yuvam _k_ a rabhyasa _h_ na _h_ ; and\nstill more clearly in IV, 55, 1. sahiyasa _h_ varu _n_ a mitra martat. But I\ndoubt whether n _r i_n by itself would be used in the sense of our men, while\nnara _h_ is a common name of the Maruts, whether as diva _h_ nara _h_ , I, 64,\n4, or as nara _h_ by themselves, I, 64, 10; 166, 13, &c.\n\nNote 2. On the meaning of avaya in avayatahe _l_ a _h_ , see Introduction, [p.\nxx](sbe3202.htm#page_xx).\n\nNote 3. On dadhana _h_ , see VIII, 97, 13, &c.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[290:a](sbe3231.htm#fr_124) See Sanskrit Grammar, \xc2\xa7 372, note.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 172.
