Let a\nman meditate on the udgitha (Om) as he who sends warmth (the sun in the sky).\nWhen the sun rises it sings as Udgat _ri_ for the sake of all creatures. When\nit rises it destroys the fear of darkness. He who knows this, is able to\ndestroy the fear of darkness (ignorance).\n\n2\\. This (the breath in the mouth) and that (the sun) are the same. This is\nhot and that is hot. This they call svara (sound), and that they call\npratyasvara 1 (reflected sound). Therefore let a man meditate on the udgitha\n(Om) as this and that (as breath and as sun).\n\n3\\. Then let a man meditate on the udgitha (Om) as vyana indeed. If we breathe\nup, that is pra _n_ a, the up-breathing. If we breathe down, that is apana,\nthe down-breathing. The combination of pra _n_ a and apana is vyana, back-\nbreathing or holding in of the breath. This vyana is speech. Therefore when we\nutter speech, we neither breathe up nor down.\n\n4\\. Speech is _Ri_ _k_ , and therefore when a man utters a _Ri_ _k_ verse he\nneither breathes up nor down.\n\np. 8\n\n_Ri_ _k_ is Saman, and therefore when a man utters a Saman verse he neither\nbreathes up nor down.\n\nSaman is udgitha, and therefore when a man sings (the udgitha, Om) he neither\nbreathes up nor down.\n\n5\\. And other works also which require strength, such as the production of\nfire by rubbing, running a race, stringing a strong bow, are performed without\nbreathing up or down. Therefore let a man meditate on the udgitha (Om) as\nvyana.\n\n6\\. Let a man meditate on the syllables of the udgitha, i. e. of the word\nudgitha. Ut is breath (pra _n_ a), for by means of breath a man rises (uttish\n_th_ ati). Gi is speech, for speeches are called gira _h_. Tha is food, for by\nmeans of food all subsists (sthita).\n\n7\\. Ut is heaven, gi the sky, tha the earth. Ut is the sun, gi the air, tha\nthe fire. Ut is the Sama-veda,, gi the Ya _g_ ur-veda, tha the Rig-veda 1.\n\np. 9\n\n[paragraph continues] Speech yields the milk, which is the milk of speech\nitself 1, to him who thus knowing meditates on those\n\np. 10\n\nsyllables of the name of udgitha, he becomes rich in food and able to eat\nfood.\n\n8\\. Next follows the fulfilment of prayers. Let a man thus meditate on the\nUpasara _n_ as, i. e. the objects which have to be approached by meditation:\nLet him (the Udgat _ri_ ) quickly reflect on the Saman with which he is going\nto praise;\n\n9\\. Let him quickly reflect on the _Ri_ _k_ in which that Saman occurs; on the\n_Ri_ shi (poet) by whom it was seen or composed; on the Devata (object) which\nhe is going to praise;\n\n10\\. On the metre in which he is going to praise; on the tune with which he is\ngoing to sing for himself;\n\n11\\. On the quarter of the world which he is going to praise. Lastly, having\napproached himself (his name, family, &c.) by meditation, let him sing the\nhymn of praise, reflecting on his desire, and avoiding all mistakes in\npronunciation, &c. Quickly 1 will the desire be then fulfilled to him, for the\nsake of which he may have offered his hymn of praise, yea, for which he may\nhave offered his hymn of praise 2.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[7:1](sbe01024.htm#fr_86) As applied to breath, svara is explained by the\ncommentator in the sense of moving, going out; pratyasvara, as applied to the\nsun, is explained as returning every day. More likely, however, svara as\napplied to breath means sound, Om itself being called svara ( _Kh_. Up. I, 4,\n3), and prasvara in the Rig-veda-prati _s_ akhya, 882. As applied to the sun,\nsvara and pratyasvara were probably taken in the sense of light and reflected\nlight.\n\n[8:1](sbe01024.htm#fr_87) The commentator supplies explanations to all these\nfanciful etymologies. The heaven is ut, because it is high; the sky is gi,\nbecause it gives out all the worlds (gira _n_ at); earth is tha, because it is\nthe place (sthana) of living beings. The sun is ut, because it is high. The\nwind is gi, because it gives out fire, &c. (gira _n_ at); fire is tha, because\nit is the place (sthana) of the sacrifice. The Sama-veda is ut, because it is\npraised as svarga; the Ya _g_ ur-veda is gi, because the gods take the\noblation offered with a Ya _g_ us; the Rig-veda is tha, because the Sama\nverses stand in it. All this is very childish, and worse than childish, but it\nis interesting as a phase of human folly which is not restricted to the\nBrahmans of India. I take the following passage from an interesting article,\n\'On the Ogam Beithluisnin and on Scythian Letters,\' by Dr. Charles Graves,\nBishop of Limerick. \'An Irish antiquary,\' he says, \'writing several hundred\nyears ago, proposes to give an account of the origin of the names of the notes\nin the musical scale.\n\n\'"It is asked here, according to Saint Augustine, What is chanting, or why is\nit so called? Answer. From this word _cantalena_ ; p. 9 and _cantalena_ is the\nsame thing as _lenis cantus_ , i. e. a soft, sweet chant to God, and to the\nVirgin Mary, and to all the Saints. And the reason why the word _puinec_ (\n_puncta_ ) is so called is because the points (or musical notes) _ut, re, mi,\nfa, sol, la_ , hurt the devil and puncture him. And it is thus that these\npoints are to be understood: viz. When Moses the son of Amram, with his people\nin their Exodus was crossing the Red Sea, and Pharaoh and his host were\nfollowing him, this was the chant which Moses had to protect him from Pharaoh\nand his host--these six points in praise of the Lord:--\n\n\'"The first point of these, i. e. _ut_ : and _ut_ in the Greek is the same as\n_liberat_ in the Latin; and that is the same as _saer_ in the Gaelic; i.e. O\nGod, said Moses, deliver us from the harm of the devil.\n\n"\'The second point of them, i.e. _re_ : and _re_ is the same as _saer_ ; i. e.\nO God, deliver us from everything hurtful and malignant.\n\n\'"The third point, i.e. _mi_ : and _mi_ in the Greek is the same as _militum_\nin the Latin; and that is the same as _ridere_ (a knight) in the Gaelic; i. e.\nO God, said Moses, deliver us from those knights who are pursuing us.\n\n\'"The fourth point, i.e. _fa_ : and _fa_ in the Greek is the same as _famulus_\nin the Latin; and that is the same as _mug_ (slave) in the Gaelic; i. e. O\nGod, said Moses, deliver us from those slaves who are pursuing us.\n\n\'"The fifth point, i.e. _sol_ : and _sol_ is the same as _grian_ (sun); and\nthat is the same as righteousness; because righteousness and Christ are not\ndifferent; i. e. O Christ, said Moses, deliver us.\n\n\'"The sixth point, i. e. _la_ , is the same as _lav_ ; and that is the same as\n_indail_ (wash); i.e. O God, said Moses, wash away our sins from us.\n\n\'"And on the singing of that laud Pharaoh and his host were drowned.\n\n\'"Understand, O man, that in whatever place this laud, i. e. this chant, is\nsung, the devil is bound by it, and his power is extirpated thence, and the\npower of God is called in."\n\n\'We have been taught that the names of the first six notes p. 10 in the gamut\nwere suggested by the initial syllables of the first six hemistichs in one of\nthe stanzas of a hymn to St. John:\n\n_Ut_ queant laxis  \n_Re_ sonare fibris  \n_Mi_ ra gestorum  \n_Fa_ muli tuorum,  \n_So_ lve polluti  \n_La_ bii reatum,  \n        _S_ ancte _I_ oannes.\'\n\n[9:1](sbe01024.htm#fr_88) The milk of speech consists in rewards to be\nobtained by the Rig-veda, &c. Or we may translate, Speech yields its milk to\nhim who is able to milk speech.\n\n[10:1](sbe01024.htm#fr_89) Abhya _s_ o ha yat, lit. depend on it that it will\nbe fulfilled, but always explained by quickly. See _Kh_. Up. II, 1, 4; III,\n19, 4; V, 10, 7. Frequently, but wrongly, written with a dental s.\n\n[10:2](sbe01024.htm#fr_90) The repetition of the last sentence is always an\nindication that a chapter is finished. This old division into chapters is of\ngreat importance for a proper study of the Upanishads.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4](sbe01025.htm)\n\n'
