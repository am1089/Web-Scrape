Wilkins, [1900], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 342\n\n### CHAPTER IX.\n\n#### THE PUR\xc4\x80NIC ACCOUNT OF THE CREATION.\n\nBefore passing on to the inferior deities, an account of the creation will be\ngiven. It is not at all easy to make out a consistent one from the Hindu\nscriptures, because the imagination of the writers seems to have run wild on\nthis subject; not having any authority, each writer has written what seemed\ngood to himself. As in the accounts of the deities, the germs are found in the\nolder books of what is told at considerable length in the more recent. The\nfollowing hymn from the Rig-Veda * describes the primal condition of things\nbefore the creative power of the Deity was exercised:--\n\n"There was neither aught nor naught, nor air, nor sky beyond.  \n What covered all? Where rested all? In watery gulf profound?  \n Nor death was then, nor deathlessness, nor change of night and day.  \n The One breathed calmly, self-sustained; nought else beyond it lay.\n\n"Gloom, hid in gloom, existed first--one sea, eluding view.  \n That One, a void in chaos wrapt, by inward fervour grew.  \n Within it first arose desire, the primal germ of mind,  \n Which nothing with existence links, as sages searching find.\n\n"The kindling ray that shot across the dark and drear abyss--  \n Was it beneath? or high aloft? What bard can answer this?  \n There fecundating powers were found, and mighty forces strove--  \n A self-supporting mass beneath, and energy above.\n\np. 343\n\n"Who knows, who ever told, from whence this vast creation rose?  \n No gods had then been born--who then can e\'er the truth disclose?  \n Whence sprang this world, and whether framed by hand divine or no--  \n Its lord in heaven alone can tell, if even he can show."\n\nThis hymn contains perhaps the earliest speculations of the Hindus respecting\nthe creation that have come down to us; and the wise conclusion was arrived at\nthat God alone knew how the world came into being. But as time went on this\nconfession of ignorance did not satisfy the cravings of the human mind: hence\nsucceeding ages sought by its conjectures, which are given with the assurance\nof exact knowledge, to throw light upon the unknowable.\n\nThe next quotation is from the "Purusha Sakta" of the Rig-Veda, which from its\nthought and language is generally believed to be of much later origin than the\npreceding hymn.\n\nPurusha has a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, a thousand feet. On every side\nenveloping the earth, he overpassed (it) by a space of ten fingers. Purusha\nhimself is this whole (universe), whatever has been and whatever shall be. He\nis also lord of immortality, since (or when) by food he expands. All\nexistences are a quarter of him, and three-fourths of him are that which is\nimmortal in the sky. With three-quarters Purusha mounted upward. A quarter of\nhim was again produced here. From him was born Vir\xc4\x81j; and from Vir\xc4\x81j, Purusha.\nWhen the gods performed a sacrifice, with Purusha as the oblation, the spring\nwas its butter, the summer its fuel, and the autumn its (accompanying)\noffering. From that universal sacrifice were provided curds and butter. From\nthat universal sacrifice sprang the Rich and S\xc4\x81man verses, the metres and the\nYajush;\n\np. 344\n\nfrom it sprang horses and all animals with two rows of teeth, kine, goats and\nsheep. When (the gods) divided Purusha, into how many parts did they cut him\nup? The Br\xc4\x81hman was his mouth, the Rajanya was made his arms, the being\n(called) Vaisya was his thighs, and the Sudra sprang from his feet. The morn\nsprang from his soul (manas), the sun from his eye, Indra and Agni from his\nmouth, and V\xc4\x81ya from his breath. From his navel arose the air, from his head\nthe sky, from his feet the earth, from his ear the (four) quarters; in this\nmanner (the gods) formed the worlds." *\n\nNow follows an extract from the "S\xc4\x81tapatha Br\xc4\x81hmana," which gives the words\nused at the creation. "(Uttering) \'bh\xc5\xabh,\' Praj\xc4\x81pati generated this earth.\n(Uttering) \'bhuvah,\' he generated the air; and (Uttering) \'svah,\' he generated\nthe sky. This universe is coextensive with these worlds. Saying \'bh\xc5\xabh,\'\nPraj\xc4\x81pati generated the Br\xc4\x81hman; (saying) \'bhuvah,\' he generated the Kshattra;\n(and saying) \'svah,\' he generated the Vis. All this world is as much as the\nBr\xc4\x81hman, Kshattra and Vis. (Saying) \'bh\xc5\xabh,\' Praj\xc4\x81pati generated himself;\n(saying) \'bhuvah,\' he generated offspring; (saying) \'svah,\' he generated\nanimals. This world is so much as self, offspring, and animals." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nThe "Taittiriya Br\xc4\x81hmana" says, "This entire (universe) has been created by\nBrahm\xc4\x81," and gives an account of the creation of the asuras, pitris (or\nfathers), and gods. "Praj\xc4\x81pati desired, \'May I propagate.\' He practised\nausterity. His breath became alive. With that breath (asu) he created asuras.\nHaving created the asuras, he regarded himself as a father. After that he\ncreated the fathers (pitris). That constitutes the fatherhood of the fathers.\nHaving created the fathers,\n\np. 345\n\nhe reflected. After that he created men. That constitutes the manhood of men.\nHe who knows the manhood of men becomes intelligent. To him, when he was\ncreating men, day appeared in the heavens. After that he created the gods." *\n\nThe "S\xc4\x81tapatha Br\xc4\x81hmana" relates the creation of men and animals. "Praj\xc4\x81pati\nwas formerly this (universe) only. He desired, \'Let me create food, and be\npropagated.\' He formed animals from his breaths, a man from his soul, a horse\nfrom his eye, a bull from his breath, a sheep from his ear, a goat from his\nvoice. Since he formed animals from his breaths, therefore men say, \'The\nbreaths are animals.\' The soul is the first of breaths. Since he formed a man\nfrom his soul, therefore they say, \'Man is the first of the animals and the\nstrongest.\' The soul is all the breaths; for all the breaths depend upon the\nsoul. Since he formed man from his soul, therefore they say, \'Man is all the\nanimals;\' for all these are man\'s." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nIn another passage this Br\xc4\x81hmana gives quite a different account. Purusha, as\nthe soul of the universe, was alone. Hence "he did not enjoy happiness. He\ndesired a second. He caused this same self to fall asunder into two parts.\nThence arose a husband and wife. From them men were born. She reflected, \'How\ndoes he, after having produced me from himself, cohabit with me? Ah! let me\ndisappear!\' She became a cow, and the other a bull; from them kine were\nproduced. The one became a mare, the other a stallion; the one a she-ass, the\nother a male-ass. From them the class of animals with undivided hoofs were\nproduced. The one became a she-goat, the other a he-goat; the one an ewe, the\nother a ram. From them goats and sheep were\n\np. 346\n\nproduced. In this manner pairs of all creatures whatsoever, down to ants, were\ncreated." *\n\nAgain, this Br\xc4\x81hmana says, "Praj\xc4\x81pati created living beings. From his upper\nvital airs he created the gods; from his lower vital airs, mortal creatures."\n\xe2\x80\xa0\n\nManu\'s account of the creation most probably follows the preceding one in\norder of time; and it will be noticed that he has developed some germs of\nthought expressed there. "He (the self-existent) having felt desire, and\nwilling to create various living beings from his own body, first created the\nwaters, and threw into them a seed. That seed became a golden egg, of lustre\nequal to the Sun; in it he himself was born as Brahm\xc4\x81, the parent of all the\nworld. The waters are called narah, for they are sprung from Nara; and as they\nwere his first sphere of motion (ayana, _i.e._ path), he is therefore called\nN\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81yana. Produced from the imperceptible, eternal, existent and non-existent\ncause, that male (purusha) is celebrated in the world as Brahm\xc4\x81. After\ndwelling for a year in the egg, the glorious being, by his own contemplation,\nsplit in twain. . . . Having divided his own body into two parts, the lord\n(Brahm\xc4\x81) became, with the half a male, and with the half a female; and in her\nhe created Viraj. Know, O most excellent twice-born men, that I, whom that\nmale Viraj himself created, am the creator of all this world."\n\nThe Pur\xc4\x81nas enter very minutely into the details of the creation. It is one of\nthe specified topics of which a Pur\xc4\x81na ought to treat. The first book of the\n"Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na" is largely filled with the accounts of this work. In his\npreface \xe2\x80\xa1 to the translation of the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na," Wilson says: "The first\nbook of the six into\n\np. 347\n\nwhich the work is divided is occupied chiefly with the details of creation,\nprimary and secondary; the first explaining how the universe proceeds from\nPrakriti, or eternal crude matter; the second, in what manner the forms of\nthings are developed from the elementary substance previously evolved, or how\nthey reappear after their temporary destruction. Both these creations are\nperiodical, but the termination of the first occurs only at the end of the\nlife of Brahm\xc4\x81; when not only all the gods and other forms are annihilated,\nbut the elements are again merged into primary substance; besides which one\nonly spiritual being exists: the latter takes place at the end of every Kalpa,\na day of Brahm\xc4\x81, and affects only the forms of inferior creatures and lower\nworlds, leaving the substance of the universe entire, and sages and gods\nunharmed."\n\nThe account in the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na" was, according to that authority,\n"originally imparted by the great father of all (Brahm\xc4\x81) in answer to the\nquestions of Daksha and other venerable sages, and repeated by them to\nPurukutsa, a king who reigned on the banks of the Narmad\xc4\x81." * " Who can\ndescribe him who is not to be apprehended by the senses? He is Brahma,\nsupreme, lord, eternal, unborn, imperishable. He then existed in the form of\nPurusha and of K\xc4\x81la. Purusha (Spirit) is the first form of the supreme; next\nproceeded two other forms, the discreet and indiscreet; and K\xc4\x81la (time) was\nthe last. These four--Pradh\xc4\x81na (primary or crude matter), Purusha (Spirit),\nVyakta (visible substance), and K\xc4\x81la (time)--in their due proportions, are the\ncauses of the production of the phenomena of creation, preservation, and\ndestruction. The supreme Brahma, the supreme soul, the substance of the world,\nthe lord of all\n\np. 348\n\ncreatures, the universal soul, the supreme ruler Hari (Vishnu), of his own\nwill having entered into matter and spirit, agitated the mutable and immutable\nprinciples, the season of creation having arrived, in the same manner as\nfragrance affects the mind from its proximity merely, and not from any\nimmediate operation upon mind itself; so the supreme influenced the elements\nof creation." *\n\nAfter giving an account of the creation, or rather the evolution of the\nelements, the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na" \xe2\x80\xa0 goes on to say: Then (the elements) ether,\nair, light, water and earth, severally united with the properties of sound,\nand the rest existed as distinguishable according to their qualities as\nsoothing, terrific, or stupefying; but possessing various energies, and being\nunconnected, they could not without combination create living beings, not\nhaving blended with each other. Having combined, therefore, with one another,\nthey assumed, through their mutual association, the character of one mass of\nentire unity; and from the direction of spirit, with the acquiescence of the\nindiscreet principle, intellect, and the rest, to the gross elements\ninclusive, formed an egg, which gradually expanded like a bubble of water.\nThis vast egg, compounded of the elements, and resting on the waters, was the\nexcellent natural abode of Vishnu in the form of Brahma; and there Vishnu, the\nlord of the universe, whose essence is inscrutable, assumed a perceptible\nform, and even he himself abided in it in the character of Brahma. Its womb,\nvast as the mountain Meru, was composed of the mountains; and the mighty\noceans were the waters that filled its cavity. In that egg were the continents\nand seas and mountains, the planets and divisions of the universe, the gods,\ndemons, and mankind.\n\np. 349\n\n"Affecting then the quality of activity, Hari the lord of all, himself\nbecoming Brahma, engaged in the creation of the universe. Vishnu, with the\nquality of goodness and of immeasurable power, preserves created things\nthrough successive ages, until the close of the period termed a Kalpa; when\nthe same mighty deity, invested with the quality of darkness, assumes the\nawful form of Rudra, and swallows up the universe. Having thus devoured all\nthings, and converted the world into one vast ocean, the supreme reposes upon\nhis mighty serpent couch amidst the deep: he awakes after a season, and again,\nas Brahma, becomes the author of creation."\n\nThe Pur\xc4\x81na next gives an account of the creation in the present Kalpa or age.\nThis is a secondary creation, for water and the earth also are already in\nexistence; it is not creation properly speaking, but the change of pre-\nexisting matter into their present forms. Vishnu knew that the earth lay\nhidden in the waters; he, therefore, assuming the form of a boar, * raised it\nupon his tusks.\n\nIn answer to a request for a full account of the creation of gods and other\nbeings, the following passages \xe2\x80\xa0 occur:--"Created beings, although they are\ndestroyed (in their original forms) at the periods of dissolution, yet, being\naffected by the good or evil acts of former existence, are never exempted from\ntheir consequences; and when Brahm\xc4\x81 creates the world anew, they are the\nprogeny of his will, in the fourfold condition of gods, men, animals, and\ninanimate things. Brahm\xc4\x81 then, being desirous of creating the four orders of\nbeings--termed gods, demons, progenitors, and men--collected his mind into\nitself.\n\n"Whilst thus concentrated, the quality of darkness\n\np. 350\n\npervaded his body, and thence the demons (the asuras) were first born, issuing\nfrom his thigh. Brahm\xc4\x81 then abandoned that form which was composed of the\nrudiment of darkness, and which, being deserted by him, became night.\nContinuing to create, but assuming a different shape, he experienced pleasure,\nand thence from his mouth proceeded the gods. The form abandoned by him became\nday, in which the good quality predominates; and hence by day the gods are\nmost powerful, and by night the demons. He next adopted another person (form)\nin which the rudiment of good men also prevailed; and thinking of himself as\nthe father of the world, the progenitors (or Pitris) were born from his side.\nThe body, when he abandoned it, became the Sandhya, or evening twilight.\nBrahm\xc4\x81 then assumed another person, pervaded by the quality of foulness; and\nfrom this, men in whom foulness (or passion) predominates, were produced.\nQuickly abandoning that body, it became the dawn. At the appearance of this\nlight of day men feel most vigour; whilst the progenitors are most powerful in\nthe evening.\n\n"Next from Brahm\xc4\x81, in a form composed of the quality of foulness, was produced\nhunger, of whom anger was born; and the god put forth in darkness beings\nemaciated with hunger, of hideous aspect and with long beards. These beings\nhastened to the deity. Such of them as exclaimed, \'Oh, preserve us,\' were\nthence called R\xc4\x81kshasas (from Raksha, to preserve); others who cried out, \'Let\nus eat,\' were denominated from that expression Y\xc4\x81kshas (from Yaksha, to eat).\nBeholding them so disgusting, the hairs of Brahm\xc4\x81 were shrivelled up, and\nfirst falling from his head were again renewed upon it; from their falling\nthey became serpents, called Sarpa (Srip, to creep), from their creeping, and\nAhi\n\np. 351\n\n[paragraph continues] (from H\xc4\x81, to abandon), because they had deserted the\nhead. The creator of the world, being incensed, then created fierce beings,\nwho were denominated goblins, bhutas, malignant fiends, and eaters of flesh.\nThe Gandharvas (choristers) were next born: imbibing melody, drinking of the\ngoddess of speech, they were born, and hence their appellation.\n\n"The divine Brahm\xc4\x81, influenced by their material energies, having created\nthese beings, made others of his own will. Birds he formed from his vital\nvigour; sheep from his heart; goats from his mouth; kine from his belly and\nsides; and horses, elephants, sarabhas, gayals, deer, camels, mules,\nantelopes, and other animals from his feet: whilst from the hairs of his body\nsprang herbs, roots, and fruits." In this manner all things are said to have\nsprung from Brahm\xc4\x81; they were with him in the egg: hence this is an account of\nevolution, rather than of creation. The creation of man, as divided into four\ncastes, is described in this Pur\xc4\x81na, in similar terms to those in Manu.\n\nFollowing this is the account of the mind-born sons of Brahm\xc4\x81--Bhrigu, Daksha,\nand others--nine in number, who became the progenitors of men. * Next "Brahm\xc4\x81\ncreated himself as Manu Sw\xc4\x81yambhu, born of, and identical with, his original\nself, for the protection of created beings: and the female portion of himself\nhe constituted Satar\xc5\xabp\xc4\x81, whom austerity purified from the sin (forbidden\nnuptials), and whom the divine Manu Sw\xc4\x81yambhu took to wife." After this\nfollows a long account of the descendants of these mind-born sons; and it is\nthen shown how by the production of the amrita at the churning of the ocean\nthe gods obtained immortality, and the work of creation for this age was\ncomplete.\n\np. 352\n\nWith some variations this is the story of the creation as told in the Pur\xc4\x81nas.\nIn some, greater prominence is given to parts that are only lightly touched\nupon in this account; whilst other incidents are more fully described here\nthan in the other Pur\xc4\x81nas.\n\n![](img/35200.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[342:*](hmvp36.htm#fr_298) Muir, O.
