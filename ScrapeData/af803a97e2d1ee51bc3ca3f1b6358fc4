Here is the secret of that worship of the\nmother in which all union of the family and all loyalty to its chief are\nrooted. Woman in the West may thirst for the glory of love or the power of\nwealth: in Asia, her characteristic dreams are of perfectness and purity and\nfaith. Woman in the West is a queen, exposed to the fierce light that beats\nupon a throne, putting to good or evil use the opportunities of sovereigns.\nEven queens in the East are too sacred to be looked upon by common eyes. They\ngrow, like the tall white lilies of annunciation, set in the dimness beside\nsome altar, screened from the very glances of the faithful at their prayers.\nThe long silken tent through which such ladies move from palace-door to\ncarriage-step is no vulgar prison, but a shrine. Bereft of its concealment,\nthey would feel dishonoured, unprotected, as does the widowed gentlewoman,\ncompelled to fight for bread, amongst the struggling crowd.\n\nThe very possibility of this blaze of publicity shed on delicate high-bred\nwomanhood is repugnant to the Oriental mind. Remoteness and shadow, silence\nand obscurity, seem to it the true environment of holiness. And woman is held\nto be so much a\n\np. 46\n\nsacred mystery that no man may even mention the name of another\'s wife to him.\n"Are they at home all well?" is the guarded form which the necessary inquiry\nfor her health has to take. The outer courts of the house, where the men pass\nthe day, the verandah and the stoop, where neighbours meet and chat, these are\nbut public places. Here the intellectual life may be lived, and civic affairs\ntransacted. But it is by the cool grey threshold of the inner, the women\'s\nrooms, that the world of home is entered. And what an ocean of passionate\nloving surges through the quiet walls! Here the wife listens for the feet of\nthe returning husband. Here the widow sobs for him who will return no more.\nHere scamper home the babies to find mother or aunt, grave elder sister, or\ntwin-souled younger comrade. Here youth lays its plans and brings its\nperplexities, while old age looks on, with the quiet eyes of experience and of\nfaith. Here passes, in short, all that mingling of smiles and tears, of\nlaughter and prayer, of charm and weariness, that goes to make up the bitter-\nsweet sacrament of daily life. Only the art of mediaeval Holland speaks a\npassion for home as ardent as this of the Orient, which as yet has found no\nvoice!\n\nStanding without in the noonday hush and looking into the semi-darkness of the\nwomen\'s apartments it is as if one caught a glimpse of some convent garden,\nfull of rare and beautiful flowers. This is the women\'s hour. Their natural\nguardians are all absent, sleeping, or at business. Only in the outer court a\ndrowsy servant guards the entrance. An air of innocent raillery, of delicate\ngaiety, pervades all. Friendly confidences and gentle fun are being exchanged.\nIt is now that the long melancholy cry of the pedlar is heard, with his\n"Bracelets and bangles--who wants?" or "Good, good cloth!" or what not. And\nthe wandering merchant may be\n\np. 47\n\ncalled in, to add amusement to the moment by his baiting and bargaining.\n\nNoonday passes, and slender widows in their long white veils fall to telling\ntheir beads, unnoticed and absorbed. Here and there a mother glides away to\nprepare for the children\'s coming home from school. The sound of laughter and\ntalk dies gradually down; and afternoon wears on to evening, and the hour of\nprayer. So passes the day\'s drama, with all its blending of subdued tints,\nfrom dainty rose to ashen grey. Yet almost all the windows of the home look\ninwards, and four blank walls enclose the whole. True indeed is it that\nsilence and shadow are the ideals of this, the life of Eastern womanhood.\n\nBut the ideal itself, that it may be fixed and perpetuated, requires its\nculminating types and centres, its own duly consecrated priesthood, whose main\ntask in life shall be to light its lamp and wait upon its altar. And such\npersons, in the world of Indian women, are the widows. Literature consists\nlargely of man\'s praise of woman in relation to himself; yet it remains\neternally true that this heroine of man--Helen, Desdemona, Beatrice--is but\none modification or other of her who goes unseen, unhymned, unnamed, the woman\nof solitude, the woman who stands alone.\n\nNeither Europe nor the modern spirit can claim the glory of having created the\nidea of woman as an individual. Queen Hatasu had it, in ancient Egypt. In\nstill older Chaldea, Semiramis had it. In the sagas of the North, it is true,\nno woman goes unwed. But no sooner does Christianity--the Mission of the\nAsiatic Life--appear amongst us, than mediaeval history blossoms into its\nHildas, and Teresas, and Joans, its Saxon Margarets and its Spanish\nKatherines. It is the _self-protecting_ woman only, who is born perhaps of the\nnineteenth century. Of old it was held by Frank and Saxon, by Latin and\n\np. 48\n\n[paragraph continues] Teuton, that she who did not marry needed the protection\nof the Church. And in Asia to this day it is believed that she requires the\nsanction of the religious life itself, though that life be lived for the most\npart within the community-house. For the only unmarried woman in India is the\nwidow, and especially the child-widow--that is, one whose betrothed has died\nbefore actual marriage.\n\nA kind of faithfulness is implied in this, which is quite different from the\nfaithfulness of the West. There, it is counted for great fidelity if amidst\nthe growing complexities of life there run the stream of a strong and constant\nmemory; if the bereaved wife be true to the idea for which the husband stood;\nif she carry his name as a banner, whose new adherents are won by the power of\nher own consecration. In India, no growth of complexity can be permitted.\nWhere the life stood when its companion was smitten down, there it must\nremain, till a second death completes the releasing of that one being who only\nseemed to others to be two.\n\nHow wonderful is death! So cold, so still! The mind is withdrawn from the\nsenses, and steadied, that enters its presence but for a moment. They who\ndwell there find release into a great calm. The Hindu widow lives out her life\nwith her soul ever present at the burning-ghat. Her white sari, unbordered,\nher short hair, her bareness of jewels, her scant food and long prayers, her\nrefusal to meet guests and join in festivities,--all these things are but the\nsymbols of its abiding lights and shadows. She has found her vocation, so to\nspeak, and as a nun must henceforth direct her life. If she be a child-widow,\nthis is only the more true. Then, the church in which she lingers is more apt\nto be the thought of the Divine itself. But if in her widowhood she can\nremember what it was to be a wife, her altar will be the name of the dead\nhusband, and\n\np. 49\n\nher austerities will carry with them the unspeakable gladness of the memory\nthat half of all their merit goes to him. This belief in a mystic union of\nsouls was the motive of suttee,--a sacrifice that was supposed to lift the\nhusband\'s soul at once into bright places, and bring his wife to enjoy them\nbeside him for thousands of years. Who, with such an idea deep-ingrained,\ncould not laugh at fire?\n\nIt is clear that this scheme of the widow\'s life is inherent in a great\nsimplicity. A marriage which had but one duty could alone have led to this\nbereavement which has but one thought. And yet we must understand that it is\nin this terrible blight of love that the strong woman finds her widest\nindividual scope.\n\nIt is told of Bhashkaracharya, the mathematician, that he had but one child,\nthe maiden Lilavati. Casting her horoscope carefully, he discovered that there\nwas only a single moment in her life when she could be married without fear of\nwidowhood. Preparations were made for the wedding accordingly, and the father\nhimself constructed an instrument by which to regulate the time of the\nceremonies. Water would be admitted drop by drop through a certain hole, from\none pot to another, and its reaching a given height was the signal for the\nsacramental act.\n\nThe marriage-rites began, but the child Lilavati grew tired, and went\nwandering from room to room in search of amusement. In some obscure corner she\ncame upon an unaccustomed-looking pot, and leaned over its edge to watch how\nthe inner section was gradually sinking in the water which it contained. As\nshe did so a tiny pearl fell all unnoticed from her wedding crown, and stopped\nthe hole through which the water passed! Time went on, but the vessel sank no\nfurther. "Ah!" exclaimed Bhashkaracharya sorrowfully, when, the hour already\npast, he found\n\np. 50\n\nthe jewel that had frustrated all his caution, "it is useless for a man to\nfight against his destiny!"\n\nWithin some few weeks or months the little bride was left a widow. But now her\ngreat father resolved to make of her a woman so learned that she should never\nsigh for earthly happiness--a resolve in which he succeeded to such an extent\nthat to this day it is not known whether the abstruse treatise named\n"Lilavati" was merely dedicated to her, or whether she asked the questions to\nwhich it contains the answers.\n\nThis story is historic. But simple instances abound in every village. The kind\nwidowed aunt who lived in the opposite house to ours, did she not count every\nsoul in the Calcutta lane, together with her brother\'s children, as her own?\n"Do not leave this country," she would say to some member of our household\nevery now and then, "for you know I count you all my bairns!" When the man in\nthe next house died of cholera, it was not we, the European neighbours, but\nthis Pishi-ma of ours, who was first on the scene with disinfectants. When the\nimmediate necessity of cleansing the whole house was explained, it was still\nanother and older widow lady who listened, and carried out the work with her\nown hands. Indeed, wherever one is called in time of need, one finds a group\nof widow-women already present. There is no act of nursing that these are not\nready, and even eager, to perform; no disease so loathsome or dangerous that\nthey will not gladly take a sick child into their arms; no injury so bitter\nthat it will prevent their weeping sorrowful tears of sympathy with the\ninjured in his hour of pain and loss.\n\nIt is quite natural that widows should he more free for the civic life than\nother women. Wives have their husbands\' comforts to attend to, and mothers\ntheir thousand and one maternal cares. But the\n\np. 51\n\nwidow, and above all the childless widow, in her agony of solitude, can hear\nthe sobs of children not her own, can stretch hands across the desert of her\nown mourning to those who are ill, or in poverty, and desolation. In the last\ngeneration lonely women had still more scope than they have now. I have heard\nof one who never sat down to the midday meal till a servant brought her word\nthat every soul in the village had already eaten. Almost every family can\nremember some aged dame of its own who was famed for her skill in all sorts of\nremedies for man and beasts. The very cow-goddesses, who are worshipped in\nHimalayan villages in time of cattle pestilence, may have been actual Hindu\nwomen of this type, raised to the rank of deities. But the last half-century\nin India has been rapidly accomplishing the decay of the middle classes; and\nwith this decay, brought about by the shrinking of wealth in its old channels,\nthe fall of woman, in social and material power, proceeds apace. Yet still the\nwidows represent the intellectual centres amongst women. The more modern they\nare, the less likely is it that they can reel off Sanskrit verses, but the\nmore probable that they read books in the vernaculars. In any case, they\nproduce the saints; and the position of a woman-saint in India is such that no\nman in her neighbourhood will venture on a journey without first presenting\nhimself before her veiled form, taking the dust of her feet, and receiving her\nwhispered blessing.\n\nWidows have constantly distinguished themselves, especially in Bengal, as\nadministrators of land and wealth. Of this pattern was the great Mahratta\nQueen of Indore, Ahalya Bai. Her husband died while waging war with Scindia\nand another, and her first act was to disband her armies, and send word to the\nsovereigns that she was at their mercy, a defenceless woman. The expected\nresult followed\n\np. 52\n\nin the complete abandonment of all hostilities. After which, Ahalya Bai Rani\nlived and reigned for many a long year eating the Hindu widow\'s handful of\nrice of her own cooking, and spending her great revenues in public works on\nthe largest scale.\n\nFor the wife becomes regent when a man dies during the minority of his son;\nand even if the latter be already of age, his ownership of an estate is by no\nmeans free and complete during the lifetime of his mother. The whole world\nwould cry shame if he acted without her occasional advice, and, indeed, the\nIndian woman\'s reputation for business capacity is so like the French that it\nis commonly said of encumbered property that it needs a widow\'s nursing.\n\nIn such a case there is, however, for the wealthy woman one temptation.\nThroughout her married life her relation with her father\'s house has remained\nclose and intimate. At least once a year, if not oftener, she has returned to\nit on visits. Her eldest child was born there under her own mother\'s care. Her\ngirlhood\'s friends have perpetually renewed her youthful memories by hastening\nto see her on her arrival, and talk over old times. It was many a year before\nthe revival of familiar associations ceased to make her wholly a child again,\nso that she would run bare-headed down the lane to a neighbour\'s house,\nrejoicing in the unaccustomed freedom of the fact that the only men she was\nlikely to meet were practically her own brothers, for she had played with them\nin babyhood.\n\nBut if the relation to her early home and to her past be thus deep and\nexquisite, what are we to say of the bond that knits together the Hindu sister\nand her brother? Here is the tie that offers to the woman of responsibilities\nher great temptation; for it is considered hard, and yet essential, for one\nwho administers a dead husband\'s wealth not to bestow it in these channels,\nnot to submit to management\n\np. 53\n\nand direction, not to transfer possession gradually from the one house to the\nother. And the very insistence upon the dishonour of such a course is in\nitself testimony to the affection that tempts. The perfect wife is she who\nloves her husband with a love that forgets even father and brothers if need\nbe. But how arduous is such perfection to attain! One day in the Hindu sacred\nyear is known as "The Feast of Brothers," because on it sisters are visited\nand give their benisons. And so, even about the detached life of the married\nwoman, made independent of her father\'s care, early associations continue to\ntwine and grow stronger. They never cease to be an organic part of her life;\nand if the stress of her existence throws her back upon them, she knows that\non which she leans, that it will not fail her at her need, or prove a false\nstaff, breaking in her hand.\n\nAnd yet her natural longing, in the first days of her widowhood, is to remain,\nunless forbidden by his poverty, in the household of her father-in-law, for\nherein lies all her loyalty to the dead. Nay, it will often happen that even a\nchild-widow is anxiously retained by her husband\'s parents, as a token, in\nsome sort, left by him who is gone. All the glory of womanhood lies in such\nthings as these. Even in her own home, too, a widow has the right to be\nexacting on a thousand little points regarding her dead husband. Do her father\nand brothers not remember the great days of obligation of the household into\nwhich she married? Do they require reminder, instead of hastening to be\nbeforehand with her, in suggesting the gifts and offerings she would do well\nto send? Ah, then, it is only herself for whom they cease to weary themselves,\nor do they forget _his_ dignity who should be as dear as their own blood. And\nfor her own part she watches with solicitude all that passes in the family\nwhose name she bears. Is a new\n\np. 54\n\nbride received among them? From her own diminishing store of jewels will be\nsent some trifle--may be only a couple of tiny gold jasmine flowers for the\nears--by the bereaved to the newly-wedded daughter-in-law. Or she hears of\nsickness and arrives to nurse. She comes to wait on the aged, or will assume\ncharge of the young while grave elders goon pilgrimage. All this implies a\nnetwork of social ideals that tends to make it difficult to divert the income\narising from alliance.\n\nOver and above her alleged common sense, on the other hand an estate that\npasses into the hands of a woman ruler enjoys the economic advantage of her\nfreedom from personal extravagance; for the energy with which a widow pursues\nafter abstinence is extraordinary. To this day she lives in an ancient India,\ncreated by her own habits. In Calcutta she drinks only Ganges water, holding\nthat the municipal supply is contaminated by European use. She will eat only\nrock-salt in order to avoid the pollution of manufacturing processes When ill\nshe accepts treatment only from the old Indian doctors, the _vaidya_ or the\n_kaviraj_ , and pays fantastic sums for their medicines if they come from\nBenares or some other seat of classic learning. If well, she eats one meal of\ncooked food prepared with her own hands at or after mid-day, and only a slight\nrefection of milk, fruit, and unleavened bread at nightfall. Her hair is cut\nshort (or in some parts of India the head is shaved), perhaps originally to\nremove the temptation of beauty, but, as far as custom knows and questions,\nonly that she may bathe the more frequently and easily--every bath conveying\nto her the notion of a baptism.\n\nSuch is her ordinary routine. Her occasional dissipations consist in a\npilgrimage, an extra visit to a temple at dawn or after sunset, or attendance\nat some ceremony of epic recitation.\n\np. 55\n\n[paragraph continues] Is it not well said that she knows no extravagance?\n\nIt is because her life is holier than that of others that no hand must touch\nher food, though she may prepare and serve the meals of any in the house. For\nthe same reason, if questions of precedence arise, she stands higher than\nmarried women. Did she not rise before dawn to tell her beads, or to sit for\nan hour in meditation? Then, when her room was cleaned and ordered, did she\nnot go to the river for the morning bath? Returning with the wet sari that she\nhad washed, according to daily custom, with her own hands, did she not don the\nsilken garment and pass to that ceremonial worship, with flowers and\nofferings, that lasts for at least an hour or more, and only when that worship\nwas ended could she begin to think of cooking her meal. With the waning of the\nafternoon she falls again to telling her beads, right hand and rosary both\nconcealed in a little bag. At the moment of "candlelight," she passes once\nmore into actual meditation. Then an hour\'s chat, the frugal evening meal, and\nso to bed, to begin at dawn on the morrow again the daily round.\n\nAn incomparable moment in the history of a Hindu family is that of the return\nto it of a young daughter freshly widowed. Unspeakable tenderness and delicacy\nare lavished on her. A score of reasons for the mitigation of her rule are\nthought out and urged. In spite of her reluctance, the parents or parents-in-\nlaw will insist. Sometimes the whole family will adopt her austere method of\nliving for a few months, and keep pace with her self-denials step by step,\ntill she herself discovers and breaks the spell. "Well, well!" exclaimed an\nold father brooding over the ruin of his child\'s happiness at such a crisis,\n"it was high time for me to retire from the world; can we not renounce\ntogether, little mother?" And while she is\n\np. 56\n\nsupported by her father\'s strong arm, the mother\'s wings are open wide, to\nfold closer than ever before the bird that has flown home with the arrow in\nits heart. Indeed, this union of theirs has become proverbial, so that if some\nsmall son be uncommonly helpful and chivalrous to his mother, friendly\nneighbours will say, in banter: "But this is no boy This is surely your\nwidowed daughter, mother!" So pass the years, till, it may be, the mother,\nherself widowed, becomes as a child, falling back upon the garnered strength\nof her own daughter. Life ebbs: but discipline gathers its perfect fruit, in\nlives stately and grave and dignified, for all their simplicity and bareness;\nin characters that are the hidden strength alike of village and of nation; in\nan ideal of sainthood justified; an opportunity of power created.\n\nIn the long years of her mature life we picture the Madonna standing always\nbeneath the Cross. And we are right. But patience! not for ever shall she\nstand thus. It shall yet come to pass that in high heaven a day shall dawn, on\nwhich, wearing the selfsame meekness, clothed in self-same humility, the\nMother of Sorrows shall be crowned--and that by her own Son!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter V.
