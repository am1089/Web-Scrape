No beast  \nWas there that lacked an ample feast.  \nFor there was store for all who came,  \nFor orphan child and lonely dame;  \nThe old and young were well supplied,  \nThe poor and hungry satisfied.  \nThroughout the day ascetics fed,  \nAnd those who roam to beg their bread:  \nWhile all around the cry was still,  \n\'Give forth, give forth,\' and \' Eat your fill.\'  \n\'Give forth with liberal hand the meal,  \nAnd various robes in largess deal.\'  \nUrged by these cries on every side  \nUnweariedly their task they plied:  \nAnd heaps of food like hills in size  \nIn boundless plenty met the eyes:  \nAnd lakes of sauce, each day renewed,  \nRefreshed the weary multitude.  \nAnd strangers there from distant lands,  \nAnd women folk in crowded bands  \nThe best of food and drink obtained  \nAt the great rite the king ordained.  \nApart from all, the Brahmans there,  \nThousands on thousands, took their share  \nOf various dainties sweet to taste,  \nOn plates of gold and silver placed,  \nAll ready set, as, when they willed,  \nThe twice-born men their places filled.  \nAnd servants in fair garments dressed  \nWaited upon each Brahman guest.  \nOf cheerful mind and mien were they,  \nWith gold and jewelled earrings gay.  \nThe best of Brahmans praised the fare  \nOf countless sorts, of flavour rare:  \nAnd thus to Raghu\'s son they cried:  \n\'We bless thee, and are satisfied.\'  \nBetween the rites some Brahmans spent  \nThe time in learned argument,  \n\np. 23  \n\nWith ready flow of speech, sedate,  \nAnd keen to vanquish in debate.  1  \n\nThere day by day the holy train  \nPerformed all rites as rules ordain.  \nNo priest in all that host was found  \nBut kept the vows that held him bound:  \nNone, but the holy Vedas knew,  \nAnd all their six-fold science  2 too.  \nNo Brahman there was found unfit  \nTo speak with eloquence and wit.  \n\nAnd now the appointed time came near  \nThe sacrificial posts to rear.  \nThey brought them, and prepared to fix  \nOf Bel  3 and Khadir  4 six and six;  \nSix, made of the Palas\'a  5 tree,  \nOf Fig-wood one, apart to be:  \nOf Sleshmat  6 and of Devadar  7  \nOne column each, the mightiest far:  \nSo thick the two, the arms of man  \nTheir ample girth would fail to span.  \nAll these with utmost care were wrought  \nBy hand of priests in Scripture taught,  \nAnd all with gold were gilded bright  \nTo add new splendour to the rite:  \n\nTwenty-and-one those stakes in all,  \nEach one-and-twenty cubits tall:  \nAnd one-and-twenty ribbons there  \nHung on the pillars, bright and fair.  \nFirm in the earth they stood at last,  \nWhere cunning craftsmen fixed them fast;  \nAnd there unshaken each remained,  \nOctagonal and smoothly planed.  \nThen ribbons over all were hung,  \nAnd flowers and scent around them flung.  \nThus decked they cast a glory forth  \nLike the great saints who star the north.  1b  \nThe sacrificial altar then  \nWas raised by skilful twice-born men,  \nIn shape and figure to behold  \nAn eagle with his wings of gold,  \nWith twice nine pits and formed three-fold  \nEach for some special God, beside  \nThe pillars were the victims tied;  \nThe birds that roam the wood, the air,  \nThe water, and the land were there,  \nAnd snakes and things of reptile birth,  \nAnd healing herbs that spring from earth;  \nAs texts prescribe, in Scripture found,  \nThree hundred victims there were bound.  \nThe steed devoted to the host  \nOf Gods, the gem they honour most,  \nWas duly sprinkled. Then the Queen  \nKaus\'alya, with delighted mien,  \nWith reverent steps around him paced.  \nAnd with sweet wreaths the victim graced;  \nThen with three swords in order due  \nShe smote the steed with joy, and slew.  \nThat night the queen, a son to gain,  \nWith calm and steady heart was fain  \nBy the dead charger\'s side to stay  \nFrom evening till the break of day.  \nThen came three priests, their care to lead  \nThe other queens to touch the steed,  \nUpon Kaus\'alya to attend,  \nTheir company and aid to lend.  \nAs by the horse she still reclined,  \nWith happy mien and cheerful mind,  \nWith Rishyas\'ring the twice-born came  \nAnd praised and blessed the royal dame.  \nThe priest who well his duty knew,  \nAnd every sense could well subdue,  \nFrom out the bony chambers freed  \nAnd boiled the marrow of the steed.  \nAbove the steam the monarch bent,  \nAnd, as he smelt the fragrant scent,  \nIn time and order drove afar  \nAll error that his hopes could mar.  \nThen sixteen priests together came  \nAnd cast into the sacred flame  \nThe severed members of the horse,  \nMade ready all in ordered course.  \nOn piles of holy Fig-tree raised  \n\np. 24  \n\nThe meaner victims\' bodies blazed:  \nThe steed, of all the creatures slain,  \nAlone required a pile of cane.  \nThree days, as is by law decreed,  \nLasted that Offering of the Steed.  \nThe Chatushtom began the rite,  \nAnd when the sun renewed his light,  \nThe Ukthya followed: after came  \nThe Atiratra\'s holy flame.  \nThese were the rites, and many more  \nArranged by light of holy lore,  \nThe Aptoryam of mighty power,  \nAnd, each performed in proper hour,  \nThe Abhijit and Vis\'vajit  \nWith every form and service fit;  \nAnd with the sacrifice at night  \nThe Jyotishtom and \xc3\x81yus rite.  1  \n\nThe task was done, as laws prescribe:  \nThe monarch, glory of his tribe,  \nBestowed the land in liberal grants  \nUpon the sacred ministrants.  \nHe gave the region of the east,  \nHis conquest, to the Hotri priest.  \nThe west, the celebrant obtained:  \nThe south, the priest presiding gained:  \nThe northern region was the share  \nOf him who chanted forth the prayer,  1b  \nThus did each priest obtain his meed  \nAt the great Slaughter of the Steed,  \nOrdained, the best of all to be,  \nBy self-existent deity.  \nIkshvaku\'s son with joyful mind  \nThis noble fee to each assigned,  \nBut all the priests with one accord  \nAddressed that unpolluted lord:  \n\'Tis thine alone to keep the whole  \nOf this broad earth in firm control.  \n\np. 25  \n\nNo gift of lands from thee we seek:  \nTo guard these realms our hands were weak.  \nOn sacred lore our days are spent:  \nLet other gifts our wants content.\'  \nThe chief of old Ikshvaku\'s line  \nGave them ten hundred thousand kine,  \nA hundred millions of fine gold,  \nThe same in silver four times told.  \nBut every priest in presence there  \nWith one accord resigned his share.  \nTo Saint Vas\'ishtha, high of soul,  \nAnd Rishyas\'ring they gave the whole.  \nThat largess pleased those Brahmans well,  \nWho bade the prince his wishes tell.  \nThen Das\'aratha, mighty king.  \nMade answer thus to Rishyas\'ring:  \n\'O holy Hermit, of thy grace,  \nVouchsafe the increase of my race.\'  \nHe spoke; nor was his prayer denied:  \nThe best of Brahmans thus replied:  \n\'Four sons, O Monarch, shall be thine,  \nUpholders of thy royal line.\'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[22:1](ry015.htm#fr_91) \'The Pravargya ceremony lasts for three days, and is\nalways performed twice a day, in the forenoon and afternoon.

This public disputation in the assembly of Brahmans on the\nnature of things, and the almost fraternal connexion between theology and\nphilosophy deserves some notice; whereas the priests of some religions are\ngenerally but little inclined to show favour to philosophers, nay, sometimes\npersecute them with the most rancorous hatred, as we are taught both by\nhistory and experience....

It is the first and principal part of the\nJyotishtoma, one of the great sacrifices in which especially the juice of the\nSoma plant is offered for the purpose of obtaining Swarga or heaven.\'\nGOLDST\xc3\x9cCKER\'S DICTIONARY. \'The _\xc3\x81 gnishtoma_ is Agni. It is called so because\nthey (the gods) praised him with this Stoma. They called it so to hide the\nproper meaning of the word: for the gods like to hide the proper meaning of\nwords.\'\n\n\'On account of four classes of gods having praised Agni with four Stomas, the\nwhole was called _Chatushtoma_ (containing four Stomas).\'\n\n\'It (the \xc3\x81gnishtoma) is called _Jyotishtoma_ , for they praised Agni when he\nhad risen up (to the sky) in the shape of a light ( _jyotis_ ).\'\n\n\'This (\xc3\x81gnishtoma) is a sacrificial performance which has no beginning and no\nend.\' HAUG\'S _Aitareya Br ahmanam_.\n\nThe Atiratra, literally _lasting through the night_ , is a division of the\nservice of the Jyotishtoma.\n\nThe Abhijit, _the everywhere victorious_ , is the name of a sub-division of\nthe great sacrifice of the Gavamanaya.\n\nThe Vis\'vajit, or _the all-conquering_ , is a similar sub-division.\n\n\xc3\x81yus is the name of a service forming a division of the Abhiplava sacrifice.\n\n\'The _Aptory am_, is the seventh or last part of the Jyotishtoma, for the\nperformance of which it is not essentially necessary, but a voluntary\nsacrifice instituted for the attainment of a specific desire. The literal\nmeaning of the word would be in conformity with the _Praudhamanoram a_, a\nsacrifice which procures the attainment of the desired object. GOLDST\xc3\x9cCKER\'S\nDICTIONARY.\n\n\'The _Ukthya_ is a slight modification of the Agnishtoma sacrifice. The noun\nto be supplied to it is _kratu_. It is a Soma sacrifice also, and one of the\nseven Sansthas or component parts of the Jyotishtoma. Its name indicates its\nnature. For _Ukthya_ means "what refers to the Uktha," which is an older name\nfor Shastra, i.e. recitation of one of the Hotri priests at the time of the\nSoma libations. Thus this sacrifice is only a kind of supplement to the\nAgnishtoma.\' HAUG.\n\n[24:1b](ry015.htm#fr_103) \'Four classes of priests were required in India at\nthe most solemn sacrifices. 1\\. The officiating priests, manual labourers, and\nacolytes, who had chiefly to prepare the sacrificial ground, to dress the\naltar, slay the victims, and pour out the libations. 2. The choristers, who\nchant the sacred hymns. 3. The reciters or readers, who repeat certain hymns.\n4. The overseers or bishops, who watch and superintend the proceedings of the\nother priests, and ought to be familiar with all the Vedas. The formulas and\nverses to be muttered by the first class are contained in the Yajur-veda-\nsanhita. The hymns to be sung by the second class are in the Sama-veda-\nsanhita. The Atharva-veda in said to be intended for the Brahman or overseer,\nwho is to watch the proceedings of the sacrifice, and to remedy any mistake\nthat may occur. The hymns to he recited by the third class are contained in\nthe Rigveds,\' _Chips from a German Workshop_.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XIV.: Ravan Doomed.](ry016.htm)\n\n'
