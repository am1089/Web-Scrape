The King said :-- \xc2\x93O Best of Munis! Tell me the names of the holy places\nof pilgrimage on the surface of this earth, the holy K _s_ etras and the holy\nrivers; what are the fruits acquired in bathing there and in making charitable\ngifts as well; also what are the rules of the journeys and acts there are to\nbe conducted?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n3-34. Vyasa said :-- Hear; I am describing to you various Tirthas or places of\npilgrimage as well as those that are highly extolled as the best places\nfavourite to the Devi. Amongst the rivers the following are reckoned as chief\nand holy :-- The Ganges, Jumna, Sarasvati, Narmadda, Gan _d_ aki, Sindhu,\nGomati, Tamasa, Cavery, Chandrahaga, Vetravati, Charmanvati, Saraju, Tapi, and\nSavramati. Besides these, there are hundreds of rivers on the surface of this\nearth; of them, those that fall into the ocean, they are holier and those that\nhave not reached the ocean are less holy. Of those rivers that fall into the\nocean, those that always flow with great current, they are comparatively\nholier; but in the two months S\xc2\x92ravan and Bhadra (15th July - 15th September)\nall the rivers are considered as if they are during their menstruation\nperiods; at this time also some rivers carry water of the rains just\nsufficient to supply the villagers with water. O King! The following are the\nfamous places of pilgrimages calculated to bestow merits:-- Pu _s_ kara, Kuruk\n_s_ ettra, the holy Dharmara _n_ ya, Pravasa, Prayaga, Naimi _s_ ara _n_ ya,\nand Arbudara _n_ ya. O King! Of the mountains, the following are considered as\nsacred :-- S\xc2\x92ris\xc2\x92aila, Sumeru, Gandhamadana; of the lakes, the following are\nvery holy and very famous :-- Manasarovara, Vi _n_ dusarovara and Ak _s_ oda;\nthese are the chief lakes. To those Munis that meditate on their \xc3\x82tman, all\nthe hermitages are sacred; still the hermitage of Badri is always considered\nvery sacred and the most celebrated; here Nara and Naraya _n_ a, the two\nfamous Munis, practised their asceticism. The Vamanas\xc2\x92rama and S\xc2\x92atayupas\xc2\x92rama\nare also well known; thus every hermitage is named after the Muni that\npractised asceticism there. Thus innumerable holy places on the surface of the\nearth are mentioned by the Munis as tending\n\n\n\np. 523\n\n\n\nto sanctify the hearts of the persons. At all these holy places, the Devi is\nworshipped in special sites consecrated to Her. All the sins are destroyed by\ntheir mere sight. The devotees of the Devi stay there, with rules obeyed. I\nwill mention afterwards some of these places in the course of my narrations. O\nBest of kings! Going to these holy places, charity, vow, sacrifices,\nasceticism and good acts all depend on one another. The holy places of\npilgrimages, asceticism, and observance of vows depend on the purity of the\narticles (Dravya S\xc2\x92uddhi), on the purity and one pointedness of actions (Kriya\nS\xc2\x92uddhi) and on the purity of the mind and heart (Chitta S\xc2\x92uddhi). Some may\nattain, at times, the Dravya S\xc2\x92uddhi and Kriya S\xc2\x92uddhi; but every one finds it\nvery difficult and, indeed, rarely get the Chitta S\xc2\x92uddhi. O King! This mind\nalways tries to seek shelter with various objects and is, therefore, always\nrestless. How, then, can the purity of mind be effected, with ease, when it is\noccupied with all sorts of thoughts on various objects. Cupidity, anger,\ngreed, pride, and egoism, these bring about all sorts of obstacles in the holy\nplaces of pilgrimages, in practising tapasya and in observing vows. O King!\nNon-injury, truthfulness, non-stealing, chastity and purity, controlling of\nsenses, and observing one\xc2\x92s own religion, all these bring about the fruits of\nthe labour in visiting all tirthas. They bestow fruits that can be obtained by\nvisiting all the tirthas. During one\xc2\x92s pilgrimage, one forsakes one\xc2\x92s Nitya\nKarma (daily duties) and one has to come in contact with various persons.\nHence one\xc2\x92s journey becomes fruitless; rather it becomes a source of sin. The\nwaters of the sacred places can only wash the outside dirts and the impurities\nof the physical bodies; they can never wash the impurities of their inner\nminds. Were it the fact that the waters of the tirthas could purify their\nminds, why was it, then, that the Munis, residing on the banks of the Ganges,\nand devoted to God, ever indulged themselves with feelings of jealousy and\nenmity against each other. The humble Munis like Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha, and the Ri _s_\nis like Vis\xc2\x92vamitra were always entangled in love and hatred and they were\never impatient with anger. Therefore it is evident that the internal\npurification, the purification of heart, the bathing in the G\xc3\xb1an Ganga flowing\nwithin, no doubt removes more the dirt than the Ganges and other places of\npilgrimages. O King! No doubt this fact must be admitted on all hands that\none\xc2\x92s impurity of mind is washed away if by the strange combination of Fate,\none comes in intimate contact with a man possessed of the Divine Knowledge. O\nKing! The Vedas or S\xc2\x92astras, vows or austerities, sacrifices or gifts none can\npurify the heart. See! Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha, the son of Brahma, though versed in the\nVedas and residing on the banks of the Ganges, was under the control of love,\nhatred and other infirmities. Out of the enmity of Vis\xc2\x92vamitra and Vas\xc2\x92i _st_\nha, arose the great battle\n\n\n\np. 524\n\n\n\nnamed \xc3\x82 _d_ i Baka, astonishing even to the Gods. In this, the ascetic\nVis\xc2\x92vamitra was cursed by Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha, on account of some curse in\nconnection with the king Haris\xc2\x92chandra and had to take his birth as a crane\n(Baka). The Ri _s_ i Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha was cursed also by Vis\xc2\x92vamitra and was born\nas a bird named S\xc2\x92arari. Thus the two powerful Ri _s_ is were born as \xc3\x82 _d_ i\nBaka and lived on the banks of the Manasarovara and they fought for full ten\nthousand years (ajuta) terribly, out of anger, with their nails and beaks like\ntwo maddened lions.\n\n\n\n35-36. The King asked :-- \xc2\x93O Muni! Why were the two Mahar _si_ s, the two\ngreat ascetics and devoted to religion, involved in enmity with each other?\nBoth of them were intelligent; how was it that they knowing the act of cursing\nto be a source of pain to men, cursed each other so painfully?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n37-48. Vyasa said :-- O King! In former times, there was born in the solar\ndynasty a king Haris\xc2\x92chandra, the son of Tris\xc2\x92anku; he was the best of the\nkings and reigned before Ramchandra. That King had no issue and therefore\npromised to Varu _n_ a, \xc2\x93O Lord of water and ocean! If I get a son born to me,\nI will perform a sacrifice, called Naramedha, where I will sacrifice my son\nfor your propitiation.\xc2\x94 Varu _n_ a was very pleased with the king when he made\nsuch a vow; and the exquisitely beautiful queen held the foetus in the womb.\nSeeing his wife in the family way, the king was very pleased and performed all\nthe purificatory ceremonies pertaining to the foetus in the womb. O King! When\nthe queen was delivered of a son endowed with all auspicious signs, the king\nHaris\xc2\x92chandra was very glad and performed duly all the Jata Karma (natal)\nceremonies and distributed as charity big sums of gold and many cows giving\ngood quantities of milk. When the festivities on the birth of the child were\ncelebrated in the palace on a grand scale, Varu _n_ a, the Lord of Waters,\nassuming the form of a Brahmi _n_ , came up there. The King, too, honoured him\nduly with seat and worshipped him regularly and asked him about his purpose,\nwhen Varu _n_ a spoke to him :-- \xc2\x93O King! I am Varu _n_ a, the Lord of Waters;\nyou promised before that you would perform Naramedha sacrifice where you would\nsacrifice your son; now do those things and keep your words true.\xc2\x94 The King\nbecame very much confused and was very much pained at heart. He then checked\nhis mental feelings of pain and spoke to the Deva Varu _n_ a, with folded\nhands :-- \xc2\x93O Lord! I will do the sacrifice duly and fulfil the promise that I\nmade before you and keep my word. But, O Best of the Devas! My legal wife will\nbe pure from her Sutika-S\xc2\x92auchak after one month, when I will perform the\nNaramedha sacrifice.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\np. 525\n\n\n\n49-53. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing thus the words of the king\nHaris\xc2\x92chandra, Varu _n_ a returned to his own abode; the King also became\nglad, but he was somewhat anxious for fear of the destruction of the child.\nWhen one month was complete, the sweet-speaking Varu _n_ a, the holder of the\nnoose, assuming the form of a very pure Brahmi _n_ , again came there to the\npalace of the king to examine him. The King worshipped him duly and gave him\nthe seat to sit and spoke, with humility, the following reasonable words :--\n\xc2\x93O Lord! My son is not yet purified; how can he be tied to the sacrificial\npost for being immolated? Therefore I will perform that sacrifice when the boy\nbecomes cleansed after a purificatory rite and becomes a K _s_ attriya. O\nDeva! If you know me as your humble servant, have mercy on me; I will then\nconsider myself as blessed. See! The children, not passed through purificatory\nrites, are not entitled to any act; therefore wait for some time longer.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n54-56. Varu _n_ a said :-- \xc2\x93O King! You are deceiving me and putting off the\ntime longer and longer; I now see that you were issueless before and now that\nyou have got a son, you are bound up in an indissoluble tie of affection for a\nson. Whatever it be, I now go back to my home at your pitiful request; I will\nwait for some time longer and I will come again. O child! Let you then be true\nto your words; if it be otherwise, I will surely curse you and thus give vent\nto my angry feelings.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n57\\. The King said :-- O Lord of the Waters! After the completion of the\nSamavartan ceremony (a pupil\xc2\x92s return home after finishing his holy study), I\nwill duly sacrifice my son at the great Naramedha sacrifice; there is no\ndoubt.\n\n\n\n58-71. Vyasa said :-- Varu _n_ a was very pleased at the King\xc2\x92s words and\nquickly went back saying \xc2\x93Let it be so.\xc2\x94 The king also became comforted. On\nthe one hand, the king Haris\xc2\x92chandra\xc2\x92s son became widely known by the name of\nRohita; and as he got older, he became gradually versed in all the sciences\nand became very clever and intelligent. That boy then came to know by degrees\nthe cause of the sacrifice in full detail; and knowing that his death is quite\ncertain, became very afraid and quickly fled away from the King and went and\nstayed in caves of mountains with a fearful heart. Then, when the proper time\ncame, Varu _n_ a came up there to the royal palace, desirous to have the\nsacrifice and spoke to the King thus :-- \xc2\x93O King! Now the prescribed time has\ncome; therefore perform the sacrifice that you have resolved to celebrate.\xc2\x94\nThe King was very much pained to hear this and spoke with a very sad\nappearance :-- \xc2\x93O Best of the Devas! What can I do now?\n\n\n\np. 526\n\n\n\nMy son has fled away out of the fear of his life; I do not know his\nwhereabouts.\xc2\x94 Varu _n_ a became very angry at these words and cursed him thus\n:-- \xc2\x93O Liar! You are an hypocrite pundit; therefore you deceived me\nfrequently. Let therefore the disease dropsy come and attack your body.\xc2\x94 Varu\n_n_ a, the Holder of the noose, cursing thus, went back to his own abode. The\nKing was attacked with that disease, remained in his own residence, afflicted\nwith cares and anxieties. Rohita, the son of the king Haris\xc2\x92chandra, heard\nabout the severe illness of his father when he was very much tormented with\nthat disease, as the curse of Varu _n_ a. One day a traveller told him :-- \xc2\x93O\nson of the King! Your father is very ill with dropsy, due to the curse, and is\nvery sorry. Certainly your brain has turned wrong; vain is your coming in this\nworld; you have passed your life to no purpose, for you are staying still in\nthis mountain cave, abandoning your sorrowful father. Certainly you are a bad\ndisobedient son; what use is there in your keeping up this body? What purpose\nwill be served by your birth? When you have got this body, you have abandoned\nthat father and are staying in this solitary cave. Know this as certain that\nto sacrifice one\xc2\x92s life is the duty of a good and obedient son; therefore what\nmore shall I say now than this that your father the king Haris\xc2\x92chandra ailing\nfrom a severe illness is very sorry for you and is always weeping.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n72-74. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing from the passerby these good words, the\nprince Rohita wanted to go to his sorrowful father attacked with disease when\nIndra assuming a Brahmi _n_ form came up to him and began to speak to him when\nhe was alone like one who was filled with mercy. O Son of a King! You are a\nfool; are you not positively acquainted with the fact that your father is in\ntrouble; why then do you intend in vain to go there?\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twelfth Chapter on the cause of the war between \xc3\x82di and Baka in\nthe Sixth Book of the Mahapura _n_ am of S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000\nverses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 13](bk06ch13.htm)\n\n'
