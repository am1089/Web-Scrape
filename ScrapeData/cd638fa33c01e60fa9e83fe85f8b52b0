Whilst the Svish\n_t_ ak _ri_ t of it remains yet unoffered, they bring a throne-seat for him\n(the king); for truly he who gains a seat in the air, gains a seat above\n(others): thus these subjects of his sit below him who is seated above,--that\nis why they bring him a throne-seat. It is of khadira (acacia catechu) wood,\nand perforated, and bound with thongs as that of the Bharatas.\n\n5:4:4:22\\. He places it (on the tiger's skin), in front of the Maitravaru _n_\na's hearth, with (Va _g_. S. X, 26), 'Thou art pleasant, thou art soft-\nseated!'--he thereby renders it kindly and auspicious.\n\n5:4:4:33\\. He then spreads a mantle over it, with, 'Thou art the womb (seat)\nof knighthood!'--he thus\n\np. 106\n\nmakes it (the king's throne) the very womb of knighthood.\n\n5:4:4:44\\. He then makes him sit down on it, with, 'Seat thee on the pleasant\none! seat thee on the soft-seated!'--whereby he says, 'Seat thyself on the\nkindly and auspicious (seat)!'--'Seat thee in the womb of knighthood!'--thus\nhe places him in what is the very womb of knighthood.\n\n5:4:4:55\\. Having touched him on the chest, he then mutters (Va _g_. S. X, 27;\n_Ri_ k S. I, 25, 10), 'He hath sat down, the upholder of the sacred law,'--the\nking indeed is the upholder of the sacred law, for he is not capable of all\nand every speech, nor of all and every deed; but that he should speak only\nwhat is right, and do what is right, of that he, as well as the _S_ rotriya\n(the Brahman versed in sacred writ), is capable; for these two are the\nupholders of the sacred law among men: therefore he says, 'He hath sat down,\nthe upholder of the sacred law;'--'Varu _n_ a, in the home-steads,'--the home-\nsteads are the peasants (clans, people): 'among the peasants' he means to\nsay;--'for supreme rule, he the wise!'--'for kingship' he means to say when he\nsays, 'for supreme rule, he the wise.'\n\n5:4:4:66\\. He then throws the five dice 1 into his hand,\n\np. 107\n\nwith (Va _g_. S. X, 28), 'Dominant thou art: may these five regions of thine\nprosper!'--now that\n\np. 108\n\none, the Kali, is indeed dominant over the (other) dice, for that one\ndominates over all the dice: therefore he says, 'Dominant thou art: may these\nfive regions of thine prosper!' for there are indeed five regions, and all the\nregions he thereby causes to prosper for him.\n\n5:4:4:77\\. They (the Adhvaryu and his assistants) then silently strike him\nwith sticks on the back;--by beating him with sticks (da _n_ _d_ a) they guide\nhim safely over judicial punishment (da _n_ _d_ abadha): whence the king is\nexempt from punishment (ada _n_ _d_ ya), because they guide him safely over\njudicial punishment.\n\n5:4:4:88\\. Thereupon he chooses a boon; and, verily, whatsoever boon he who\nhas been anointed chooses, that is completely fulfilled for him: therefore he\nchooses a boon.\n\n5:4:4:99\\. 'O Brahman!' thus he addresses (the priest) the first time 1,\nthinking, 'I will first utter the (word)\n\np. 109\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahman, I will speak speech sped by the Brahman:' this\nis why he first addresses him with 'O Brahman!' The other answers, 'Thou art\nBrahman! Thou art Savit _ri_ of true impulsion!'--he thereby lays vigour into\nhim, and causes Savit _ri_ to be of true impulsion.\n\n5:4:4:1010\\. 'O Brahman!' thus he addresses him the second time. The other\nanswers, 'Thou art Brahman! Thou art Varu _n_ a of true power!'--he thereby\nlays vigour into him, and causes Varu _n_ a to be of true power.\n\n5:4:4:1111\\. 'O Brahman!' thus he addresses him the third time. The other\nanswers, 'Thou art Brahman! Thou art Indra, mighty through the people 1!'--he\nthereby lays vigour into him, and causes Indra to be mighty through the\npeople.\n\n5:4:4:1212\\. 'O Brahman!' thus he addresses him the\n\np. 110\n\nfourth time. The other answers, 'Thou art Brahman! Thou art Rudra, the most\nkindly!'--he thereby lays into him (the king) those former energies, and he\nappeases him (Rudra); and he, Rudra, therefore, is gracious to every one,\nbecause he (the priest) appeases him.\n\n5:4:4:1313\\. 'O Brahman!' thus he addresses him the fifth time. The other\nanswers (undefinedly), 'Thou art Brahman!'--undefined means unlimited: thus\nheretofore he laid limited vigour into him; but now he answers undefinedly;\nand undefined meaning unlimited, he thereby lays complete, unlimited vigour\ninto him: therefore he answers here undefinedly.\n\n5:4:4:1414\\. He then hails him as one bearing auspicious names,--'Much-worker,\nbetter-worker, more-worker 1!' Whoever bears such names speaks auspiciously\neven with a human voice.\n\n5:4:4:1515\\. A Brahma _n_ a then hands to him the sacrificial (wooden) sword,\n--either the Adhvaryu, or he who is his (the king's) domestic chaplain--with,\n'Indra's thunderbolt thou art: therewith serve me!'--the sacrificial sword\nbeing a thunderbolt, that Brahma _n_ a, by means of that thunderbolt, makes\nthe king to be weaker than himself; for indeed the king who is weaker than a\nBrahma _n_ a, is stronger than his enemies: thus he thereby makes him stronger\nthan his enemies.\n\n5:4:4:1616\\. The king hands it to the king's brother, with, 'Indra's\nthunderbolt thou art: therewith serve me!' Thereby the king makes his brother\nto be weaker than himself.\n\n5:4:4:1717\\. The king's brother hands it either to the\n\np. 111\n\n[paragraph continues] Suta (minstrel and chronicler), or to the Governor,\nwith, 'Indra's thunderbolt thou art: therewith serve me!' Thereby the king's\nbrother makes the Suta, or the Governor, to be weaker than himself.\n\n5:4:4:1818\\. The Suta, or the Governor, hands it to the Grama _n_ i (village-\nheadman 1), with, 'Indra's thunderbolt thou art: therewith serve me!' Thereby\nthe Suta, or the Governor, makes the headman to be weaker than himself.\n\n5:4:4:1919\\. The Grama _n_ i hands it to a tribesman 2, with, 'Indra's\nthunderbolt thou art: therewith serve me!' Thereby the headman makes the\ntribesman to be weaker than himself. And as to why they mutually hand it on in\nthis way, they do so lest there should be a confusion of classes, and in order\nthat (society) may be in the proper order.\n\n5:4:4:2020\\. Thereupon the tribesman and the Pratiprasthat _ri_  3, with that\nsacrificial sword, prepare the gaming-ground, (close) by the original fire 4,\nwith the puroru _k_ verse of the _S_ ukra 5. The _S_ ukra is the eater: he\nthereby makes (him) the eater.\n\n5:4:4:2121\\. With the puroru _k_ verse of the Manthin 6 they then put up a\nshed (vimita). The Manthin cup is\n\np. 112\n\nhe that is to be eaten,--thus having first made (him) the feeder, they now\nmake for him one to be fed upon: that is why they put up a shed with the\npuroru _k_ verse of the Manthin cup.\n\n5:4:4:2222\\. The Adhvaryu then takes clarified butter in four ladlings, places\na piece of gold on the gaming-ground, and offers with (Va _g_. S. X, 29), 'May\nample Agni, the lord of rites, delighted,--may ample Agni, the lord of rites,\naccept of the butter, hail!'\n\n5:4:4:2323\\. He (the Adhvaryu) throws down the dice, with, 'Hallowed by Svaha,\nstrive ye with Surya's rays for the middlemost place among brethren!' For that\ngaming-ground is the same as 'ample Agni,' and those dice are his coals, thus\nit is him (Agni) he thereby pleases; and assuredly in the house of him who\noffers the Ra _g_ asuya, or who so knows this, the striking 1 of that cow is\napproved of. On those dice he says, 'Play for the cow!' The two draught oxen\nof the original (hall-door) fire are the sacrificial fee.\n\n5:4:4:2424\\. He then says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni Svish _t_\nak _ri_ t!' And as to why that ceremony is performed between two oblations,--\nverily, Pra _g_ apati is that sacrifice which is here performed, and from\nwhich these creatures have been produced,--and, indeed, they are even now\nproduced after this one;--thus he places him (the Sacrificer) in the very\nmiddle of that Pra _g_ apati, and consecrates him in the very middle: that is\nwhy that ceremony is performed between two oblations.\n\np. 113\n\n[paragraph continues] Having called for the _S_ rausha _t_ , he says,\n'Pronounce the offering-formula to Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t,' and offers as\nthe Vasha _t_ is uttered.\n\n5:4:4:2525\\. He then puts the i _d_ a on (the fire). After the invocation of I\n_d_ a, he touches water and draws the Mahendra cup. Having drawn the Mahendra\ncup, he sets the chant agoing. He urges him (the Sacrificer) forward to the\nchant: he gets down (from the throne-seat); he is in attendance at the chant\n(stotra), in attendance at the recitation ( _s_ astra).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[106:1](sbe4121.htm#fr_209) The allusions to the game of dice in the early\nliterature are not sufficiently definite to enable us to form a clear idea as\nto the manner in which the game was played. Saya _n_ a, on our passage (as on\nTaitt. S. I, 8, 16), remarks that the dice here used consisted either of gold\ncowries (shells) or of gold (dice shaped like) Vibhitaka nuts. That the\n(brown) fruit of the Vibhitaka tree (Terminalia Bellerica)--being of about the\nsize of a nutmeg, nearly round, with five slightly flattened sides--was\ncommonly used for this purpose in early times, we know from the Rig-veda; but\nwe do not know in what manner the dice were marked in those days. According p.\n107 to the commentators, the game is played with five dice, four of which are\ncalled k _ri_ ta, whilst the fifth is called kali; and if all the dice fall\nuniformly (ekarupa)--i.e. with the marked sides either upwards or downwards--\nthen the player wins, and in that case the kali is said to overrule the other\ndice. In this case the kali would seem to represent the king. Katy. _S_ r. XV,\n7, 18-19, however, admits of another mode of playing, by which the kali\nrepresents the sa _g_ ata (tribesman), whilst the king and those that come\nafter him (in the enumeration in paragraphs 15-20) play the k _ri_ ta, &c, To\nunderstand this mode, we have probably to turn to _Kh_ andog. Up. IV, 1, 4,\nwhere it is said of the saint Raikva, that everything good fell to him, just\nas the lower dice (or casts) submit to the conquering k _ri_ ta. Here the\ncommentators assign the names k _ri_ ta, treta, dvapara, and kali to different\nsides of the die, marked respectively with 4, 3, 2, and 1 marks (a\xe1\xb9\x85ka).--In\nTaitt. Br. I, 7, 10 the game at dice, at the Ra _g_ asuya, is referred to as\nfollows:--With, 'This king has overcome the regions,' he hands (to the king)\nfive dice; for these are all the dice: he thereby renders him invincible. They\nengage (to play) for a dish of rice (odana), for that is (a symbol of) the\nchief: he thus makes him obtain every prosperity. He addresses them (with the\nepithets of) 'far-famed, most prosperous, true king.' The Commentary and\nSutras then supply the following explanations:--The keeper of the dice\n(akshavapa), having (marked off and) raised the gambling-ground (by means of\nthe wooden sword), and sprinkled it, throws down more than a hundred--or more\nthan a thousand--gold dice. From them he takes five dice and hands them to the\nking: these, as representing the five regions, are taken to include all those\ndice. These explanations, so far from clearing up the doubtful points, seem\nrather to add to them. It may be noted, however, that in the well-known hymn,\n_Ri_ k S. X, 34, in which the gambler's state of mind is pictured in very\nexpressive language, the dice of the game are apparently spoken of as tripa\n_\xc3\xb1_ ka _s_ a vrata, or 'the troop of fifty-three' (or thrice five, according\nto Ludwig's rather improbable conjecture). For other particulars see R. Roth,\nZeitsch. d. deutsch. morg. Ges. II, p. 122; A. Weber, Ind. Stud. I, p. 284.\nAccording to Goldstucker (s.v. abhishe _k_ aniya) this game of dice is\nintended to symbolize the victory of the present age, or kali-yuga, over the\nformer ages; but the commentator rather takes it as symbolizing the king's\ndig-vi _g_ aya, or victorious sway in every quarter.\n\n[108:1](sbe4121.htm#fr_210) If it were not for the clear and unmistakable\ninterpretation of the commentators on the Brahma _n_ a and Katyayana, one\nmight feel inclined to translate, 'thus he addresses the first--the second,'\n&c., so as to bring it into accord with the practice of the Black Ya _g_ us.\nThis practice is as follows (Taitt. S. I, 8, 16, with commentary).--The priest\nmoves the previously uplifted arms of the Sacrificer down to the Vai _s_\nvadeva dish of curds (cf. above, V, 4, 3, 27), with, 'Thou art Mitra!--thou\nart Varu _n_ a!' He then places the khadira throne-seat on the vedi, covers it\nwith a leathern (or fur) cover, with, 'Thou art the navel of the Kshatra, the\nwomb of the Kshatra,' and makes the king sit down with, 'Seat thee on the\npleasant one, seat thee on the soft-seated!' The king sits down, with, 'May it\nnot injure thee! may it not injure me!' The priest then addresses him, with,\n'He hath sat down, the upholder of the sacred law, Varu _n_ a in the\nhomesteads, for supreme rule, he the wise!' The priests and Ratnins (see V, 3,\n1, 1 seq.) then sit down in a circle round the king in. order to do homage to\nhim,--the Adhvaryu being seated towards the east, the Brahman towards the\nsouth, the Hot _ri_ p. 109 towards the west, the Udgat _ri_ towards the north.\nThe king then addresses the Adhvaryu, with, 'O Brahman, (Om)!' That priest\nreplies, 'Thou, O king, art Brahman, thou art Savit _ri_ of true impulsion.'\nIn the same way the king addresses the Brahman, 'O Brahman!' and that priest\nreplies, 'Thou, O king, art Brahman, thou art Indra, of true energy!' Then the\nHot _ri_ , who replies, '. . . thou art Mitra, the most kindly!'--the Udgat\n_ri_ : '. . . thou art Varu _n_ a, of true laws!' Thereupon the Brahman hands\nthe sacrificial sword to the king, with, 'Indra's thunderbolt thou art!' He\nthen hands to him five dice, with, 'This king has overcome the regions!' see\nnext note.--The charioteer, treasurer, and chamberlain are invited by the king\n(to the game?) by auspicious epithets ('far-famed one,' 'most prosperous one,'\n'true king'). Thereupon the Hot _ri_ recites the story of _S_ una _h_ _s_ epa,\nwhereupon follows the offering of the svish _t_ ak _ri_ t of the cake of the\nMaruts, and the dish of curds to the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_.\n\n[109:1](sbe4121.htm#fr_211) Or, he whose strength is the people (vi _s_ , vi\n_s_ a),--that is, the Maruts, in the case of Indra, and the subjects or\npeasantry in that of the king. Say.\n\n[110:1](sbe4121.htm#fr_212) That is, increaser of the prosperity of himself\nand his people.\n\n[111:1](sbe4121.htm#fr_213) See [p. 60](sbe4113.htm#page_60), note\n*[1](sbe4113.htm#fn_129)*.\n\n[111:2](sbe4121.htm#fr_214) The sa _g_ ata would seem to be one of the peasant\nproprietors or 'sharers' constituting the village 'brotherhood' ruled over by\nthe headman, and often actually belonging to the same family as the latter\n(Gaugenosse, clansman).\n\n[111:3](sbe4121.htm#fr_215) The first assistant of the Adhvaryu.\n\n[111:4](sbe4121.htm#fr_216) That is, north of the \xc3\x82havaniya fire, where the\ncart stands, containing the original (hall-door) fire.\n\n[111:5](sbe4121.htm#fr_217) For this verse (Va _g_. S. VII, 12; _Ri_ k S. V,\n44, 1), preceding the ordinary formula with which the Soma-cups are drawn, see\nIV, 2, 1, 9 (part ii, p. 280).\n\n[111:6](sbe4121.htm#fr_218) Va _g_. S. VII, 16; _Ri_ k S. X, 723, 7; see IV,\n2, 7, 70.\n\n[112:1](sbe4121.htm#fr_219) Thus (not the slaying) according to the commentary\non Katy.
