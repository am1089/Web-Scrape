If (that period has already) elapsed, through one night or three nights.\n\n46\\.

The fourth one should be left out.\n\n52 52. Some (make Pi _n_ _d_ a offerings to a deceased person) separately\nthrough one year (before admitting him to a share in the common Pit _ri_ ya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a).\n\n53 53.
