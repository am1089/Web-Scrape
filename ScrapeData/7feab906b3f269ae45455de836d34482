If it be said (that the pra _n_ as do not go) on account of the scriptural\nstatement as to entering into Agni, &c., we deny this on account of the\nmetaphorical nature (of those statements).\n\nWell, the purvapaksha resumes, we deny that at the time when a new body is\nobtained the pra _n_ as go with the soul, because scripture speaks of their\ngoing to Agni, &c. For that at the time of death speech and the other pra _n_\nas go to Agni and the other gods the following passage expressly declares:\n'When the speech of the dead person\n\np. 106\n\nenters into the fire, breath into the air,' &c. (B _ri_. Up. III, 2. l3).--To\nthis we reply that the objection is of no force on account of the metaphorical\ncharacter of those statements. The entering of speech, &c., into Agni is\nmetaphorical, because we observe no such entering in the case of the hairs of\nthe head and body. For although the text says that 'the hairs of the body\nenter into the shrubs and the hairs of the head into the trees;' still we\ncannot understand this to mean that the hairs actually fly away from the body\nand enter into trees and shrubs. On the other hand, the soul could not go at\nall if we denied to it the limiting adjunct formed by the pra _n_ as, and\nwithout the latter it could not, in the new body, enter into the state of\nfruition. Besides, other passages distinctly declare that the pra _n_ as go\nwith the soul.--From all this we conclude that the passage about speech, &c.\nentering into Agni, metaphorically expresses that Agni and the other\ndivinities who act as guides of the pra _n_ as and cooperate with them stop\ntheir cooperation at the time of death.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 1, 5](sbe38081.htm)\n\n"
