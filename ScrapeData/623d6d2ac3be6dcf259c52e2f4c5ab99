And (they are) minute.\n\nAs the text 'these are all alike, all infinite' (B _ri_. Up. I, 5, 13),\ndeclares speech, mind, and breath to be infinite, we conclude that the pra _n_\nas are all-pervading.--To this the Sutra replies, that they are minute; for\nthe text 'when the vital breath passes out of the body, all the pra _n_ as\npass out after it' (B _ri_. Up. V, 4, 2), proves those pra _n_ as to be of\nlimited size, and as when passing out they are not perceived by bystanders,\nthey must be of minute size--The text which speaks of them as infinite is a\ntext enjoining meditation ('he who meditates on them as infinite'), and\ninfinity there means only that abundance of activities which is an attribute\nof the pra _n_ a to be meditated on.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 7.
