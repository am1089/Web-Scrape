(Should it be said that the souls must possess unlimited power) on\naccount of manifest teaching; we reply No, because scripture states him who,\nentrusted with office, abides in the spheres (of the sun and so on), (to be\nthat one on whom the soul's obtaining lordly power depends).\n\nIt remains to refute the remark, made by the purvapakshin, that absolute power\non the part of those who know must be inferred from texts directly asserting\nsuch power, as e.g. 'He obtains self-lordship.'--This refutation the above\nSutra undertakes. Scripture declares that the obtainment of rulership on the\nsoul's part, depends on the\n\np. 417\n\nhighest Lord who, as entrusted with definite offices, abides in certain\ndefinite abodes, such as the sphere of the sun, &c. This is shown by the text\ngoing on to say (after the clause quoted above), 'He obtains the lord of\nMind.' For that means that he obtains the lord known to be the lord of all\nminds. In accordance herewith the text later on says that he becomes lord of\nspeech, lord of the eye, lord of the ear, lord of understanding.--Similarly in\nother passages also the lordly power of the other souls has to be viewed,\naccording to circumstances, as depending on the eternally perfect Lord.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[416:1](sbe38333.htm#fr_236) Ki _m_ _k_ a paraisyaiva nityatvena\nsvahetvanapeksha _n_ asya k _li_ pta _s_ aktitva _g_ _g_ agatsar _g_ ana _m_\nprati kalpyasamarthya _k_ _k_ a vidusham i _s_ varavishayaiva _g_ agats _ri_\nsh _t_ ir esh _t_ avya, ki _m_ _k_ a paurvaparyalo _k_ anayam i _s_ varasyaiva\n_g_ agatsarga _h_ _s_ abdad gamyate _g_ anmadisutram arabhya _k_ aitad\nupapaditam. \xc3\x82n.
