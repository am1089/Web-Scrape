If it be objected that it (viz. the Lord's having regard to merit and\ndemerit) is impossible on account of the non-distinction (of merit and\ndemerit, previous to the first creation); we refute the objection on the\nground of (the world) being without a beginning.\n\nBut--an objection is raised-the passage, 'Being only this was in the\nbeginning, one, without a second,' affirms that before the creation there was\nno distinction and consequently no merit on account of which the creation\nmight have become unequal. And if we assume the Lord to have been guided in\nhis dispensations by the actions of living beings subsequent to the creation,\nwe involve ourselves in the circular reasoning that work depends on diversity\nof\n\np. 360\n\ncondition of life, and diversity of condition again on work. The Lord may be\nconsidered as acting with regard to religious merit after distinction had once\narisen; but as before that the cause of inequality, viz. merit, did not exist,\nit follows that the first creation must have been free, from inequalities.\n\nThis objection we meet by the remark, that the transmigratory world is without\nbeginning.--The objection would be valid if the world had a beginning; but as\nit is without beginning, merit and inequality are, like seed and sprout,\ncaused as well as causes, and there is therefore no logical objection to their\noperation.--To the question how we know that the world is without a beginning,\nthe next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1, 36](sbe34175.htm)\n\n"
