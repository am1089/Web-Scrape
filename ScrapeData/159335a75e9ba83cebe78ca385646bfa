This explanation is necessitated\nby the reasons set forth in the preceding Sutras (which show that the real\nhighest Brahman cannot be meant).--But, if the soul advancing on the path of\nthe Gods reaches Hira _n_ yagarbha only, texts such as 'This is the path of\nthe Gods, the path of Brahman; those who proceed on that path do not return to\nthe life of man' ( _Kh_. Up. IV, 15, 6), and 'moving upwards by that a man\nreaches immortality' (VIII, 6, 6), are wrong in asserting that that soul\nattains to immortality and does not return; for the holy books teach that Hira\n_n_ yagarbha, as a created being, passes away at the end of a dviparardha-\nperiod; and the text 'Up to the world of Brahman the worlds return again'\n(Bha.
