He puts the heads of the victims in (the fire-pan),--the heads of\nthe victims being animals (or cattle), it is animals he thus puts thereon. He\nputs them in the fire-pan;--the pan being these worlds, and the heads of the\nvictims being beasts, he thus\n\np. 401\n\nputs animals in these worlds; whence there are animals in these worlds.\n\n7:5:2:22\\. And as to why (he puts the heads) in the fire-pan;--the fire-pan\nbeing a womb, and the heads of the victims being animals, he thus establishes\nthe animals in the womb: hence animals, though being eaten and cooked, do not\ndiminish, for he establishes them in the womb.\n\n7:5:2:33\\. And, again, why he puts the heads of the victims therein;--what\n(animal) perfections ( _s_ ri) 1 there were, they are these victims' heads;\nand what rumps there were, they are those five layers (of the altar). Now\nthose five layers are these worlds, and these worlds are this very fire-pan:\nthus, when he puts the heads of the victims in the fire-pan, he thereby unites\nthose rumps with those heads.\n\n7:5:2:44\\. He puts them in the fore-part, so as to look towards the back\n(west). For when, on that (former) occasion, Pra _g_ apati wanted to slaughter\nthese animals, they, being about to be slaughtered, wanted to run away. He\nseized them by (the organs of) the vital airs 2; and having seized them by the\nvital airs, he took them into himself from the front (mouth) towards the back\n(inside).\n\n7:5:2:55\\. Now the same thing which the gods did is done here. The animals do\nnot, indeed, want to run away from him; but when he does this, it is because\nhe wants to do what the gods did: having thus seized them by (the outlets of)\nthe vital airs, he takes them into himself from the front towards the back.\n\np. 402\n\n7:5:2:66\\. And, again, why he puts the heads of the victims thereon. Pra _g_\napati alone was here at first 1. He desired, 'May I create food, may I be\nreproduced!' He fashioned animals from his vital airs, a man from his soul\n(mind), a horse from his eye, a cow from his breath, a sheep from his ear, and\na goat from his voice; and inasmuch as he created them from the vital airs,\npeople say that 'Animals are vital airs.' The soul is the first of the vital\nairs; and inasmuch as he fashioned man from his soul, they say that 'Man is\nthe first, and strongest of animals.' The soul is all the vital airs, for in\nthe soul all the vital airs are established. And inasmuch as he fashioned man\nfrom his soul, they say that 'Man is all animals,' for they all belong to man.\n\n7:5:2:77\\. Having created that food, he took it into himself from the front\ntowards the back; and hence whosoever prepares for himself food, takes it into\nhimself from the front towards the back (inside). That (animal food being put)\nin the fire-pan, and the fire-pan being the belly, he thus puts the food into\nthe belly.\n\n7:5:2:88\\. He now (in the first place 2) thrusts gold chips into each of them,\n--gold is vital air, and the vital airs go out of these animals when\nslaughtered: thus, when he thrusts gold chips into each of them, he puts the\nvital airs into them.\n\n7:5:2:99\\. Seven (chips) he thrusts into each,--seven vital airs there are in\nthe head: these he thereby puts into it. And if there are five victims, let\nhim thrust in five times seven (chips); for those five victims he puts on (the\nfire-pan), and there are seven vital\n\np. 403\n\nairs in each victim: he thus puts the vital airs into all of them.\n\n7:5:2:1010\\. Now, even if there is only one victim 1, some people thrust five\ntimes seven (into that one head), thinking, 'Those five victims he puts down\n(symbolically), and there are seven vital airs in each victim: thus we put the\nvital airs into all of them.' Let him not do so, for in this animal the form\nof all animals is contained 2; and when he thrusts (seven chips) into this\none, he thereby puts the vital airs into all of them.\n\n7:5:2:1111\\. The first (chip) he thrusts into the mouth, with (Va _g_. S.\nXIII, 38; _Ri_ k S. IV, 58, 6, 5), 'Fitly flow the draughts of milk like\nrivers,'--draughts of milk are food, and that indeed flows fitly into this\nmouth;--'purified within by the heart, by the mind,'--for the food is indeed\npurified by the heart and mind within him who is righteous;--'the streams of\nghee I behold,' he thereby means the libations he is about to offer on that\nfire;--'the golden reed (is) in the middle of Agni,' he thereby means that\ngold man.\n\n7:5:2:1212\\. With (Va _g_. S. XIII, 39), 'For praise thee!' (he thrusts one\nin) here (into the right nostril); praise (or splendour) means breath, for\nwith breath one praises;--with, 'For sheen thee!' here (into the left\nnostril); sheen means breath, for by breath one shines; and also because\neverything here shines for breath;--with, 'For brightness thee!' here (into\nthe right eye);--with, 'For lustre thee!' here\n\np. 404\n\n[paragraph continues] (into the left eye), for bright and lustrous these two\neyes indeed are;--with, 'This hath become the fiery spirit of all the world,\nand of Agni Vai _s_ vanara,' here (into the right ear);--with (Va _g_. S.\nXIII, 40), 'Agni, bright with brightness, the golden disk, lustrous with\nlustre,' here (into the left ear),--thus with two (formulas) containing 'all\n1'; for the ear is all.\n\n7:5:2:1313\\. He then lifts up the human head--he thereby exalts it--with,\n'Giver of a thousand thou art: for a thousand thee!' a thousand means\neverything: thus, 'the giver of everything, for everything (I bestow) thee!'\n\n7:5:2:1414\\. He then puts them (the heads) in (the fire-pan), first (that of)\nthe man--having taken possession of the man by strength he sets him up;--the\nman in the middle; on both sides the other victims: he thus sets the man, as\nthe eater, in the midst of cattle; whence man is the eater in the midst of\ncattle.\n\n7:5:2:1515\\. The horse and ram on the left (north) side: he thereby puts those\ntwo (kinds of) cattle in that region; whence those two (kinds of) cattle are\nmost plentiful in that region.\n\n7:5:2:1616\\. The bull and he-goat on the right (south) side: he thereby puts\nthose two (kinds of) cattle in that region; whence those two (kinds of) cattle\nare most plentiful in that region.\n\n7:5:2:1717\\. The (head of the) man he places on the milk 2,--milk means\ncattle: he thus establishes the Sacrificer among cattle,--with (Va _g_. S.\nXIII, 41), 'With\n\np. 405\n\nmilk anoint thou \xc3\x82ditya, the unborn child!' that unborn child, the man, is\nindeed the sun: thus, Him anoint thou with milk!--'the all-shaped maker of a\nthousand,' the maker 1 of a thousand is man; for to him belong a\nthousand;--'spare him with thy heat, harbour not evil thoughts against him!'\nthat is, spare him with thy fire, do not hurt him!--'make him live a hundred\nyears, while thou art built!' he thereby makes man the one among animals\n(capable of) living a hundred years; whence man, among animals, lives up to- a\nhundred years.\n\n7:5:2:1818\\. Then on the left side (he puts the head of) the horse, with (Va\n_g_. S. XIII, 42), 'The speed of the wind,'--this one, the horse, is indeed\nthe speed of the wind;--'Varu _n_ a's navel'--for the horse is Varu _n_\na;--'the horse, born in the midst of the flood;' the flood is the water, and\nthe horse is indeed the water-born;--'the tawny, rock-founded child of\nrivers;' rock means mountain, and the waters are indeed founded on the\nmountains;--'harm him not, Agni, in the highest region!' the highest region\nmeans these worlds: thus, do not harm him in these worlds!\n\n7:5:2:1919\\. Then on the right side (the head of) the bull, with (Va _g_. S.\nXIII, 43), 'The imperishable, red drop,' the drop doubtless is Soma; and that\nbull is the same as the imperishable Soma;--'the eager one (bhura _n_ yu),'\nthat is, the bearer (bhart _ri_ );--'Agni, the forward-striving, I glorify\nwith homages;' for\n\np. 406\n\nthe bull is sacred to Agni; and 'the forward-striving,' he says, because\nforward (towards the east) they hold up Agni 1, and towards the front 2 they\nattend upon him;--'duly fitting thyself by limbs,' when he is built up, then\nhe does indeed duly fit himself limb by limb;--'harm not the inexhaustible,\nwide-ruling cow 3,' the cow is indeed wide-ruling (vira _g_ ), and the wide-\nruling is food, and accordingly the cow is food.\n\n7:5:2:2020\\. Then on the left side (he puts the head of) the ram, with (Va\n_g_. S. XIII, 44), 'The defender of Tvash _t_ _ri_ , the navel of Varu _n_ a,'\nfor the ewe is sacred both to Varu _n_ a and to Tvash _t_ _ri_ ;--'the ewe\nborn from the highest sphere;' the highest sphere doubtless is the ear, and\nthe ear is the regions,--(thus 4) the highest sphere is the regions;--'the\nmighty, thousandfold artifice of the \xc3\x82sura,' that is, the great, thousandfold\nartifice of the \xc3\x82sura 5;--'O Agni, harm it not in the highest\n\np. 407\n\nregion!' the highest region are these worlds: thus, do not harm him (the ram)\nin these worlds!\n\n7:5:2:2121\\. Then on the right side (he puts the head of) the he-goat, with\n(Va _g_. S. XII I, 45), 'The Agni who was born from Agni,' for that Agni was\nindeed born from Agni 1;--'from the pain of the earth or also of the sky;' for\nwhat was born from the pain (or heat) of Pra _g_ apati, that was born from the\npain of the sky and the earth;--'whereby Vi _s_ vakarman begat living beings,'\n--the he-goat (or, the unborn one) is Va _k_ (Speech) 2, and from Va _k_ Vi\n_s_ vakarman 3 begat living beings;--'him, O Agni, may thy wrath spare!' as\nthe text, so the meaning.\n\n7:5:2:2222\\. These are the victims; separately he puts them down, separately\nhe 'settles' them, and separately he pronounces the Sudadohas on them; for\nseparate from one another are those animals.\n\n7:5:2:2323\\. He then offers on the human head,--sacrifice is offering: he thus\nmakes man the one among animals fit to sacrifice; whence man alone among\nanimals performs sacrifice.\n\n7:5:2:2424\\. And, again, why he offers thereon:--he thereby lays vigour into\nthe head. He offers with ghee,--ghee is a thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt\nmeans vigour: he thus lays vigour into it. With 'Hail' (he offers),--the\n'Hail' (svahakara, m.) is a male, and the male means vigour: he thus lays\nvigour into it. With a trish _t_ ubh verse (he offers);the Trish _t_ ubh is a\nthunderbolt, and the thunderbolt\n\np. 408\n\nmeans vigour; the Trish _t_ ubh is vigour: with vigour he thus lays vigour\ninto it.\n\n7:5:2:2525\\. Having run through 1 the (first) half-verse, he pronounces the\nSvaha;--the _ri_ _k_ (verse) is a bone: having cleft asunder that skull-bone\nwhich is here inside the head, he there lays vigour into it.\n\n7:5:2:2626\\. Having then run through the (second) half-verse, he pronounces\nthe Svaha,--having joined together that skull-bone which is here on the top of\nthe head, he there lays vigour into it.\n\n7:5:2:2727\\. [Va _g_. S. XIII, 46; _Ri_ k S. I, 115, 1] 'The brilliant front\nof the gods hath risen,' for that man is yonder sun, and he indeed rises as\nthe brilliant front (face) of the gods;--'the eye of Mitra, Varu _n_ a, and\nAgni,' for that (sun) is the eye of both gods and men;--'he hath filled\nheaven, and earth, and the air,' for when he rises he indeed fills these\nworlds;--'Surya, the soul of the movable and immovable;' for that (sun) is\nindeed the soul of everything here that moves and stands.\n\n7:5:2:2828\\. He then stands by (the heads, revering them) with the Utsargas 2.\nFor at that time when Pra _g_ apati wanted to slaughter the victims, they,\nbeing about to be slaughtered, were distressed (or pained); and by these\nUtsargas he drove out their distress 3, their evil. In like manner does this\none, by these Utsargas, now drive out their distress, their evil.\n\n7:5:2:2929\\. Now some remove the distress of whichever (head of a) victim they\nput down, thinking lest they might put distress, evil, thereon; but it is they\nthat\n\np. 409\n\nput distress, evil, thereon; for the distress they remove from the preceding\none, they put on (the altar) with the succeeding one.\n\n7:5:2:3030\\. And some revere (the heads) whilst moving round them, thinking,\n'we remove distress upwards;' but these indeed follow the distress, the evil,\nupwards; for upwards he (the Sacrificer) goes by this performance 1, and\nupwards they remove the distress.\n\n7:5:2:3131\\. Let him remove it outside the fire (-altar); that fire (-altar)\nbeing these worlds, he thus puts distress outside these worlds;--outside the\nVedi; the Vedi being this earth, he thus puts distress outside this earth; (he\ndoes so) standing with his face towards the north; for in that region those\nanimals are, and he thus puts distress into them in the region in which they\nare.\n\n7:5:2:3232\\. He first removes that of the man--for him he puts down first--\nwith (Va _g_. S. XIII, 47), 'Harm not this two-footed animal!' the two-footed\nanimal doubtless is the same as man: thus, 'do not harm that one!'--'(thou)\nthe thousand-eyed, being built for pith;'--the thousand-eyed he (Agni) is on\naccount of the chips of gold; 'for pith,' that is, 'for food.'--'Graciously\naccept thou, O Agni, the sham-man, the victim, as pith!' a sham-man is a kim-\npurusha (mock-man) 2: thus, 'accept graciously the kim-purusha, O\nAgni!'--'Building up therewith thy forms, get thee settled!' the form is the\nself: thus, 'Building up\n\np. 410\n\ntherewith, perfect thyself 1!'--'Let thy burning heat reach the sham-man! let\nthy burning heat reach him whom we hate!' he thereby lays burning heat into\nthe sham-man, and into him whom he hates.\n\n7:5:2:3333\\. Then that of the horse, with (Va _g_. S. XIII, 48), 'Harm not\nthis one-hoofed animal!' the one-hoofed animal doubtless is the same as the\nhorse: thus, do not harm that one!--'the racer neighing among the racers;' for\nneighing indeed he is, and a racer among racers;--'The wild fallow (beast) do\nI assign unto thee,' he thereby assigns to him the wild fallow (beast)\n2;--'building up therewith thy forms, get thee settled!' that is, 'building up\ntherewith, perfect thyself!'--'Let thy burning heat reach the fallow beast!\nlet thy burning heat reach him whom we hate!' he thereby lays burning heat\ninto the fallow beast, and into him whom he hates.\n\n7:5:2:3434\\. Then that of the bull, with (Va _g_. S. XIII, 49), 'This\nthousandfold, hundred-streamed well--,' for a thousandfold, hundred-streamed\nwell he, the bull (cow), indeed is;--'extended in the middle of the flood,'\nthe flood doubtless are these worlds: thus, subsisted upon in these\nworlds;--'the inexhaustible, milking ghee for man,'--for ghee this\ninexhaustible (cow) indeed milks for man--\n\np. 411\n\n[paragraph continues] 'harm not, O Agni, in the highest region!' the highest\nregion doubtless are these worlds: thus, do not harm it in these worlds!--'The\nwild buffalo do I assign unto thee,' he thereby assigns to him the wild\nbuffalo (gavaya);--'building up therewith thy forms, get thee settled!' that\nis, 'building up therewith, perfect thyself!'--'Let thy burning heat reach the\nbuffalo! let thy burning heat reach him whom we hate!' he thereby lays burning\nheat into the buffalo, and into him whom he hates.\n\n7:5:2:3535\\. Then that of the sheep, with (Va _g_. S. XIII, 50), This\nwoollen--,' that is, 'this woolly,'--'navel of Varu _n_ a,' for the sheep is\nsacred to Varu _n_ a;--'the skin of animals, two-footed and four-footed,' for\nthat (sheep) indeed is the skin of both kinds of animals 1, two-footed and\nfour-footed;--'the first birth-place of Tvash _t_ _ri_ 's creatures,' for\nTvash _t_ _ri_ indeed fashioned this as the first form;--'harm not, O Agni, in\nthe highest region!' the highest region is these worlds: thus, 'do not harm\nhim in these worlds!'--'The wild buffalo do I assign unto thee,' he thereby\nassigns the wild buffalo (ush _t_ ra) to him;--'building up therewith thy\nforms, get thee settled!' that is, 'building up therewith, perfect\nthyself!'--'Let thy burning heat reach the buffalo! let thy burning heat reach\nhim whom we hate!' he thereby lays burning heat into the buffalo, and into him\nwhom he hates.\n\n7:5:2:3636\\. Then that of the he-goat, with (Va _g_. S. XIII, 51), 'Verily,\nthe he-goat was produced from Agni's heat;'--that which was produced from\n\np. 412\n\n[paragraph continues] Pra _g_ apati's heat, was indeed produced from Agni's\nheat;--'he saw the progenitor at first,' the progenitor doubtless is Pra _g_\napati: thus, 'he saw Pra _g_ apati at first;'--'thereby the gods at first\n(agre) went to the godhead;' the he-goat 1 doubtless is speech; and from\nspeech the gods doubtless first went to the godhead, to the summit\n(agram);--'thereby they went to the height, the wise;' the height doubtless is\nthe heavenly world: thus, 'thereby they went to the heavenly world, the\nwise;'--'The wild _s_ arabha do I assign unto thee,'--he thereby assigns the\nwild _s_ arabha 2 to him;--'building up therewith thy forms, get thee\nsettled!' that is, 'building up therewith, perfect thyself!'--'Let thy burning\nheat reach the _s_ arabha! let thy burning heat reach him whom we hate!' he\nthereby lays burning heat into the _s_ arabha, and into him whom he hates.\n\n7:5:2:3737\\. As to this they say,--The pain (heat), the evil of these animals,\nwhich Pra _g_ apati drove out, became these five animals; they, with their\npith (sacrificial essence) gone out of them, are pithless, unfit for\nsacrifice; a Brahma _n_ a should not eat of them: he consigns them to that\nregion; whence Par _g_ anya does not rain in that region where these are.\n\n7:5:2:3838\\. He returns (to the offering-fire) and stands thereby worshipping\nit;--for when he goes outside the Vedi, whilst Agni (the fire-altar) is only\nhalf built up, he does what is improper; he now makes amends to him to prevent\nhis doing injury. With\n\np. 413\n\na verse to Agni (he worships): it is to Agni he thereby makes amends;--with an\nundefined one; the undefined means everything: by means of everything he thus\nmakes amends to him;--with (a verse) containing the word 'youngest:' this\nindeed, to wit, the youngest, is his favourite form.;--inasmuch as when born\nhe took possession (yu) of everything here, he is the youngest (yavish _th_\na).\n\n7:5:2:3939\\. [Va _g_. S. XIII, 52; _Ri_ k S. VIII, 84, 3] 'Shield thou, O\nyoungest, the men of the liberal worshipper!' the liberal worshipper is the\nSacrificer, and the men are the people;--'hear thou the songs!' that is, hear\nthis hymn of praise!--'protect thou kin and self!' the kin (race) means\noffspring: thus, 'protect both (the Sacrificer's) offspring and himself.'\n\n7:5:2:4040\\. Having stepped on the altar and walked round behind the\nnaturally-perforated (brick), he lays down the Apasya _h_ (water-bricks);--now\nthe Apasya _h_ are the same as water, and the water has gone out of these\nvictims: he thus puts water into these victims, when he lays down the Apasya\n_h_ (bricks). He lays them down close to the (heads of the) animals: he\nthereby puts the water together with the animals. He lays down five (bricks)\nin each quarter, for five are those victims. He lays them down in every\n(quarter): everywhere he thus puts water into them.\n\n7:5:2:4141\\. Now the first fifteen are the Apasya _h_ ,--water is a\nthunderbolt, and the thunderbolt is fifteenfold;--hence wherever the waters\nflow, there they destroy evil; and verily the thunderbolt destroys the evil of\nthis place: hence, when it rains one should go about uncovered, thinking, 'May\nthat thunderbolt remove evil from me!'\n\np. 414\n\n7:5:2:4242\\. And the last five are the _Kh_ andasya _h_ (the metres'\nbricks);--the metres are cattle, and cattle is food; or rather the flesh of\ncattle is food, and the flesh has departed from these victims: he therefore\nputs flesh on those cattle when he lays down the _Kh_ andasya _h_. He places\nthem close to the victims: he thereby puts the flesh close to the (bones of\nthe) cattle. The Apasya _h_ are inside, the _Kh_ andasya _h_ outside; for the\nwater is inside, and the flesh outside.\n\n7:5:2:4343\\. As to this they say, 'If there are that water and that flesh,\nwhere then is the skin, and where the hair?' Well, the skin of cattle is food,\nand the hair of cattle is food; and when he lays down the _Kh_ andasya _h_ ,\nthat is the skin of the victims, that is their hair. Or, again, those goats'\nhair which are in the fire-pan 1, they are hair. The fire-pan is outside, and\nthe victims' heads are inside, for outside is the hair, and inside is the\nbody. 'Whether in the one way, or whether in the other,' so _S_ andilya was\nwont to say, 'in any case we make up the victims wholly and completely.'\n\n7:5:2:4444\\. And, again, why he lays down the Apasya _h_. When Pra _g_ apati\nwas disjointed the water went from him; that being gone, he sank down; and\nbecause he sank down (vi _s_ ), therefore there are twenty (vi _m_ _s_ ati,\nviz. such bricks). It flowed from his fingers,--the fingers being the end, it\n(the water) went from him in the end.\n\n7:5:2:4545\\. Now the Pra _g_ apati who became disjointed is this very Agni who\nis now being built up; and the water (apa _h_ ) which went from him is these\nvery\n\np. 415\n\n[paragraph continues] Apasya _h_ ;--hence when he lays them down, he thereby\nputs back into him that very water which went from him: therefore he now lays\nthese down.\n\n7:5:2:4646\\. [Va _g_. S. XIII, 43] 'In the way of the waters I settle thee!'\nthe way of the waters is the wind; for when he blows hither and thither then\nthe waters flow: in the wind he 'settles' this (first brick).\n\n7:5:2:4747\\. 'In the swell of the waters I settle thee!' the swell of the\nwaters is the plants, for wherever the waters keep swelling there plants grow:\nin the plants he settles this (brick).\n\n7:5:2:4848\\. 'In the ashes of the waters I settle thee!' the ashes of the\nwaters are the foam: in foam he settles this one.\n\n7:5:2:4949\\. 'In the light of the waters I settle thee!' the light of the\nwaters is the lightning: in the lightning he settles this one.\n\n7:5:2:5050\\. 'In the path of the waters I settle thee!' the path of the waters\nis this earth, for on the earth the waters flow: on this earth he settles this\none. Whatever water flowed from those (five) forms of his, that water he now\n(by these five formulas) puts back into him; and those forms themselves he\nthereby restores to him.\n\n7:5:2:5151\\. 'In the flood, the seat, I settle thee!' the flood is the breath:\nin the breath he settles this one.\n\n7:5:2:5252\\. 'In the ocean, the seat, I settle thee!' the sea is the mind;\nfrom the mind-ocean, with speech for a shovel, the gods dug out the triple\nscience. Thereto this verse applies,--'May the true god know this day where\nthe gods placed that offering, they who dug it out from the ocean with\n\np. 416\n\nsharp shovels;'--the ocean is the mind, the sharp shovel is speech, the\noffering is the triple science: it is thereto this verse applies. In the mind\nhe settles this (brick).\n\n7:5:2:5353\\. 'In the stream, the seat, I settle thee!' the stream is speech:\nin speech he settles this one.\n\n7:5:2:5454\\. 'In the abode of the waters I settle thee!' the abode of the\nwaters is the eye, for there water always abides: in the eye he settles this\none.\n\n7:5:2:5555\\. 'In the goal of the waters I settle thee!' the goal of the waters\nis the ear: in the ear he settles this one. Whatever water flowed from those\n(five) forms of his, that water he now (by these five formulas) puts back into\nhim; and those forms themselves he thereby restores to him.\n\n7:5:2:5656\\. 'In the seat of the waters I settle thee!' the seat of the waters\nis the sky, for in the sky the waters are seated: in the sky he settles this\none.\n\n7:5:2:5757\\. 'In the home of the waters I settle thee!' the home of the waters\nis the air: in the air he settles this one.\n\n7:5:2:5858\\. 'In the womb of the waters I settle thee!' the womb of the waters\nis the sea: in the sea he settles this one.\n\n7:5:2:5959\\. 'In the sediment of the waters I settle thee!' the sediment\n(purisha) of the waters is sand: in the sand he settles this one.\n\n7:5:2:6060\\. 'In the resort of the waters I settle thee!' the resort of the\nwaters is food: in food he settles this one. Whatever water flowed from those\n(five) forms of his, that water he now (by these five formulas) puts back into\nhim; and those forms themselves he thereby restores to him.\n\n7:5:2:6161\\. 'By the Gayatri metre I settle thee!--\n\np. 417\n\n[paragraph continues] By the Trish _t_ ubh metre I settle thee!--By the _G_\nagati metre I settle thee!--By the Anush _t_ ubh metre I settle thee!--By the\nPa\xe1\xb9\x85kti metre I settle thee!' Whatever water flowed from those metres of his,\nthat he now (by these formulas) puts back into him; and those metres\nthemselves he thereby restores to him.\n\n7:5:2:6262\\. These (bricks) are fingers (and toes): he puts them on all sides\n1, for these fingers (and toes) are on all sides; he puts them at the ends,\nfor these fingers (and toes) are at the ends; in four sets he puts them on,\nfor these fingers (and toes) are in four sets; five he puts on each time, for\nthere are five fingers (or toes) at each (limb); separately he puts them on,\nfor separate are these fingers (and toes); only once he 'settles' each (set):\nhe thereby makes (each set) one and the same, whence they have a common\nconnecting-link.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[401:1](sbe4166.htm#fr_739) See [VI, 1, 1, 4](sbe4128.htm#6:1:1:4); [2, 1,\n7](sbe4131.htm#6:2:1:7).\n\n[401:2](sbe4166.htm#fr_740) That is, by the head, according to Saya _n_ a.\n\n[402:1](sbe4166.htm#fr_741) See J. Muir, Original Sanskrit Texts, V, p. 391.\n\n[402:2](sbe4166.htm#fr_742) That is, before putting the heads in the fire-pan.\n\n[403:1](sbe4166.htm#fr_743) Viz. a he-goat, as the animal sacrifice to either\nPra _g_ apati, or (Vayu) Niyutvat; see pp. [178](sbe4132.htm#page_178),\n[184](sbe4132.htm#page_184).\n\n[403:2](sbe4166.htm#fr_744) See [VI, 2, 2, 15](sbe4132.htm#6:2:2:15).\n\n[404:1](sbe4166.htm#fr_745) Only the first of the two formulas, however,\ncontains the word 'vi _s_ va,' all.\n\n[404:2](sbe4166.htm#fr_746) The pan was partly filled with sand and milk, see\n[VII, 1, 1, 41](sbe4155.htm#7:1:1:41), [44](sbe4155.htm#7:1:1:44).\n\n[405:1](sbe4166.htm#fr_747) 'Pratima' is perhaps taken here by the dogmatic\nexpositor in the sense of 'likeness, counterpart;' in which case one would\nhave to translate, 'the counterpart of a thousand, the all-shaped one.'\n\n[406:1](sbe4166.htm#fr_748) See [VI, 4, 3, 10](sbe4139.htm#6:4:3:10).\n\n[406:2](sbe4166.htm#fr_749) Or, 'they attend upon him (Agni, the fire-altar)\nwho tends towards the front (east);' inasmuch as the altar is built in the\nshape of a bird flying eastwards.\n\n[406:3](sbe4166.htm#fr_750) Or, harm not the cow, the wide-ruling (or wide-\nshining) Aditi!\n\n[406:4](sbe4166.htm#fr_751) After the two premises (with 'vai') the inference\nseems here to be introduced without any particle. Similarly in paragraph\n[24](sbe4166.htm#7:5:2:24); while in paragraph [19](sbe4166.htm#7:5:2:19) the\nparticle 'u' is used to perform that office. Cf. however [VII, 4, 2,\n1](sbe4164.htm#7:4:2:1), where a third parallel clause (which logically might\nhave been the inference) is introduced by 'u vai.'\n\n[406:5](sbe4166.htm#fr_752) Saya _n_ a refers to the legend in Taitt. S. II,\nI, 2, 2, here alluded to:--Svarbhanu, the \xc3\x82sura, struck the sun with darkness.\nThe gods sought an expiation for that (darkness): the first darkness of his\nwhich they dispelled became a black ewe, the second a red one, the third a\nwhite one; and what they cut off from the surface of the bone (?) that became\na barren sheep, &c.\n\n[407:1](sbe4166.htm#fr_753) Viz. inasmuch as the fire to be ultimately\ndeposited on the fire-altar was taken from the original (hall-door) fire.\n\n[407:2](sbe4166.htm#fr_754) See [VI, 1, 1, 9](sbe4128.htm#6:1:1:9).\n\n[407:3](sbe4166.htm#fr_755) That is, Pra _g_ apati, the lord of procreation;\nsee [VI, 1, 2, 6](sbe4129.htm#6:1:2:6) seq.\n\n[408:1](sbe4166.htm#fr_756) That is, having rapidly muttered it.\n\n[408:2](sbe4166.htm#fr_757) That is, (means of) deliverance or removal, a term\napplied to the next five mantras.\n\n[408:3](sbe4166.htm#fr_758) Lit. their burning heat ( _s_ u _k_ ); cf. [par.\n32](sbe4166.htm#7:5:2:32) seq.\n\n[409:1](sbe4166.htm#fr_759) The Sacrificer builds the fire-altar with a view\nto his securing for himself a place in heaven.\n\n[409:2](sbe4166.htm#fr_760) It is doubtful what is meant here by this term,\nunless it be a monkey, or a counterfeit human head; cf. [p.\n197](sbe4134.htm#page_197), note [4](sbe4134.htm#fn_405).\n\n[410:1](sbe4166.htm#fr_761) This paraphrase does not make it clear how the\nauthor construes and interprets this part of the formula; especially in what\nsense he takes 'nishida.'\n\n[410:2](sbe4166.htm#fr_762) Thus Mahidhara (gauravar _n_ a _m_ m _ri_ gam). In\nthe St. Petersburg dictionary 'gaura' is taken here in the sense of 'buffalo,\nbos gavaeus.' The parallelism in the next two formulas might indeed seem to\npoint to that meaning.\n\n[411:1](sbe4166.htm#fr_763) Viz. inasmuch as its wool serves as a cover for\nman and beast.\n\n[412:1](sbe4166.htm#fr_764) 'A _g_ a,' he-goat, is here again taken in the\nsense of 'a- _g_ a,' unborn. As to the gods having sprung from Va _k_ , see\n[VI, 1, 2, 6](sbe4129.htm#6:1:2:6) seq.\n\n[412:2](sbe4166.htm#fr_765) A fabulous animal with eight legs.\n\n[414:1](sbe4166.htm#fr_766) See [VI, 4, 4, 22](sbe4140.htm#6:4:4:22); [5, 1,\n4](sbe4141.htm#6:5:1:4).\n\n[417:1](sbe4166.htm#fr_767) The four sets of bricks are placed in the middle\nof the four sides of the square 'body' of the altar-site, or at the ends of\nthe two spines' intersecting each other.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Corrections](sbe4167.htm)\n\n"
