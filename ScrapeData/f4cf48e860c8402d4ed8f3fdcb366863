Verily, the dawn is the head of the sacrificial horse 1, the sun\nits eye, the wind its breath, Agni Vai _s_ vanara (the fire belonging to all\nmen) its open mouth. The year is the body of the sacrificial horse, the sky\nits back, the air its belly, the earth the under part of its belly, the\nquarters its flanks, the intermediate quarters its ribs, the seasons its\nlimbs, the months and half-months its joints, the days and nights its feet,\nthe stars its bones, the welkin its flesh, the sand its intestinal food, the\nrivers its bowels, the mountains its liver and lungs, the herbs and trees its\nhair, the rising sun the forepart, and the setting sun the hindpart of its\nbody, the lightning its yawning, the thundering its whinnying, the raining its\nvoiding urine, and speech its voice. The day, indeed, was produced as the\nMahiman 2 (cup) before the horse, and its birthplace is in the eastern sea.\nThe night was produced as the Mahiman (cup) behind (or after) it, and its\nbirth-place was in the western sea: these two Mahiman (cups), indeed, came to\nbe on both sides of the horse. As Haya (steed) it carried the gods, as Va _g_\nin (racer) the Gandharvas, as Aryan (courser) the Asuras, as A _s_ va (horse)\nmen. The sea, indeed, is its kindred, the sea its birth-place.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[401:1](sbe4374.htm#fr_829) That is, of Pra _g_ apati, in the form of a horse.\nFor this and the next chapters see the beginning of the Ka _n_ va recension of\nthe B _ri_ had-ara _n_ yakopanishad.\n\n[401:2](sbe4374.htm#fr_830) This is the name of two gold cups used at the A\n_s_ vamedha; cf.
