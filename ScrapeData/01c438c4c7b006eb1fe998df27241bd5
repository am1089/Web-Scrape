It is highly probable,\n\np. x\n\nthat of the present popular forms of the Hindu religion, none assumed their\nactual state earlier than the time of \xc5\x9aankara \xc3\x81charya, the great \xc5\x9aaiva\nreformer, who flourished, in all likelihood, in the eighth or ninth century.\nOf the Vaishn\xcc\x81ava teachers, Ramanuja dates in the twelfth century,\nMadhwacharya in the thirteenth, and Vallabha in the sixteenth 17; and the\nPuran\xcc\x81as seem to have accompanied or followed their innovations, being\nobviously intended to advocate the doctrines they taught. This is to assign to\nsome of them a very modern date, it is true; but I cannot think that a higher\ncan with justice be ascribed to them. This, however, applies to some only out\nof the number, as I shall presently proceed to specify.\n\nAnother evidence of a comparatively modern date must be admitted in those\nchapters of the Puran\xcc\x81as which, assuming a prophetic tone, foretell what\ndynasties of kings will reign in the Kali age. These chapters, it is true, are\nfound but in four of the Puran\xcc\x81as, but they are conclusive in bringing down\nthe date of those four to a period considerably subsequent to Christianity. It\nis also to be remarked, that the Vayu, Vishn\xcc\x81u, Bhagavata, and Matsya\nPuran\xcc\x81as, in which these particulars are foretold, have in all other respects\nthe character of as great antiquity as any works of their class 18.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[x:17](vp002.htm#fr_16) As.
