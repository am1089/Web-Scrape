It is\nto meet this need that the present volume has been written. In an introductory\nchapter are set forth the true province of religion and the full significance\nof the word "spirituality" as it is understood in India. Next follows a\ncomprehensive definition of the term "Yoga," with short chapters on each of\n\np. 6\n\nthe five paths to which it is applied, and their respective practices. An\nexhaustive exposition of the Science of Breathing and its bearing on the\nhighest spiritual development shows the fundamental physiological principles\non which the whole training of Yoga is based; while a concluding chapter,\nunder the title "Was Christ a Yogi?" makes plain the direct relation existing\nbetween the lofty teachings of Vedanta and the religious faiths of the West.\nAn effort has been made, so far as possible, to keep the text free from\ntechnical and Sanskrit terms; and the work should therefore prove of equal\nvalue to the student of Oriental thought and to the general reader as yet\nunfamiliar with this, one of the greatest philosophical systems of the world.\n\nTHE EDITOR.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Contents](hby02.htm)\n\n'
