Charm against worms.\n\n1\\. With Indra's great mill-stone, that crushes all vermin, do I grind to\npieces the worms, as lentils with a mill-stone.  \n2\\. I have crushed the visible and the invisible worm, and the kururu, too, I\nhave crushed. All the algandu and the saluna, the worms, we grind to pieces\nwith our charm.  \n3\\. The algandu do I smite with a mighty weapon: those that have been burned,\nand those that have not been burned, have become devoid of strength. Those\nthat are left and those that are not left do I destroy with my song, so that\nnot one of the worms be left.  \n4\\. The worm which is in the entrails, and he that is in the head, likewise\nthe one that is in the ribs: avaskava and vyadhvara, the worms, do we crush\nwith (this) charm.  \n5\\. The worms that are within the mountains, forests, plants, cattle, and the\nwaters, those that have settled in our bodies, all that brood of the worms do\nI smite.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II. 32.
