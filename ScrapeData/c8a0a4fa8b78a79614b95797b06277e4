As (scripture where speaking of the rinsing of the mouth with water)\nmakes a reference to an act (established by Sm _ri_ ti), (that act is not\nenjoined by _S_ ruti, but rather) the new (act of meditation on the water\nviewed as the dress of pra _n_ a).\n\nThe _Kh_ andogas as well as the Va _g_ asaneyins record, in the colloquy of\nthe pra _n_ as, that the food of Breath comprizes everything even unto dogs\nand birds, and that water is its dress. To this the _Kh_ andogas add,\n\'Therefore when going to eat food they surround it before and after with\nwater\' ( _Kh_. Up. V, 2, 2). And the Va _g_ asaneyins add (B _ri_. Up. VI, 1,\n14), \' _S_ rotriyas who know this rinse the mouth with water when they are\ngoing to eat and rinse the mouth with water after they have eaten, thinking\nthat thereby they make the breath dressed. Therefore a man knowing this is to\nrinse the mouth with water when going to eat and after having eaten; he\nthereby makes that breath dressed.\'--These texts intimate two things, rinsing\nof the mouth and meditation on the breath as dressed. The doubt then arises\nwhether the texts enjoin both these matters, or only the rinsing of the mouth,\nor only the meditation on breath as dressed.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that the text enjoins both, since the one as well\nas the other is intimated by the text, and since both matters not being\nsettled by any other means of knowledge are worthy of being enjoined by the\nVeda.--Or else, he says, the rinsing of the mouth only is enjoined, since with\nreference to the latter only the text exhibits the particular injunctive\nverbal form (\'he is to rinse\'). In this latter case the mention made in the\ntext of the meditation on breath as dressed has merely the purpose of\nglorifying the act of rinsing.\n\np. 212\n\nTo this we make the following reply.--The rinsing of the mouth cannot possibly\nbe enjoined by the quoted passages \'since they merely contain references to an\nact,\' i.e. since they merely contain remarks concerning the purificatory act\nof rinsing the mouth which is known from and settled by Sm _ri_ ti.--But are\nnot the very _S_ ruti-passages under discussion to be looked upon as the\nfundamental texts on which the Sm _ri_ ti-injunctions regarding the rinsing of\nthe mouth are based?--This is not possible, we reply, since the _S_ ruti and\nSm _ri_ ti-passages refer to different matters. All the Sm _ri_ ti-passages\nenjoin the act of rinsing the mouth only in so far as it purifies man; while\nthe quoted _S_ ruti texts which occur in pra _n_ a-vidyas, if enjoining the\nrinsing of the mouth at all, enjoin it with reference to the knowledge of pra\n_n_ a. And a _S_ ruti-passage cannot constitute the basis of a Sm _ri_ ti-\npassage referring to an altogether different matter. Nor can it be maintained\nthat the _S_ ruti-passage enjoins some altogether new rinsing of the mouth\nconnected with the pra _n_ a-vidya, as we recognise the rinsing mentioned in\n_S_ ruti as the ordinary rinsing performed by men for the sake of\npurification.--The preceding argumentation already precludes the alternative\nof two matters being enjoined, which would moreover lead to a so-called split\nof the sentence.--We therefore conclude that the text--with reference to the\nrinsing of the mouth before and after eating which is enjoined by Sm _ri_ ti-\nenjoins (by means of the passage, \'thinking that thereby they make the breath\ndressed\') a new mental resolve with regard to the water used for rinsing\npurposes, viz. that that water should act as a means for clothing the pra _n_\na. The statement about the clothing of the pra _n_ a cannot (as suggested by\nthe purvapakshin) be taken as a glorification of the act of rinsing the mouth;\nfor in the first place the act of rinsing is not enjoined in the Vedic passage\n1, and in the second place we apprehend that the passage itself conveys an\ninjunction, viz. of the mental\n\np. 213\n\nresolve to provide clothing for the pra _n_ a. Nor must the objection be\nraised that in that case two purposes are admitted for the one act of rinsing\nthe mouth, viz. the purpose of purification and the purpose of providing the\npra _n_ a with clothing. For we have actually to do not with one action, but\nwith two separate actions. For one action is the rinsing of the mouth which\nserves the purpose of purifying man, and another action is the mental resolve\nthat that water should serve the purpose of clothing the pra _n_ a. Similarly\nthe preceding passage, \'Whatever there is, even unto dogs, &c., that is thy\nfood,\' does not enjoin the promiscuous use of food of all kinds--for that\nwould be contrary to scripture and impossible in itself--but merely enjoins\nthe meditation on all food as food of the pra _n_ a. We therefore conclude\nthat also the passage, \'Water is thy dress," which forms the immediate\ncontinuation of the passage last quoted does not enjoin the act of rinsing the\nmouth but merely the act of meditating on the rinsing-water as constituting\nthe dress of the pra _n_ a.\n\nMoreover the mere present-form, \'they rinse the mouth with water,\' has no\nenjoining force.--But also in the passage, \'They think that thereby they make\nthe breath dressed,\' we have a mere present-form without injunctive power (and\nyet you maintain that that passage conveys an injunction)!--True; but as\nnecessarily one of the two must be enjoined 1, we assume, on the ground of\nwhat the text says about the making of a dress, that what is enjoined is the\nmeditation on water being the dress of pra _n_ a; for this is something \'new,\'\ni.e. not established by other means of knowledge 2. The rinsing of the mouth\nwith water, on the other hand, is already established by other means (i.e. Sm\n_ri_ ti), and therefore need not be enjoined again.--The argument founded\n\np. 214\n\nby the purvapakshin on the circumstance that, in the B _ri_. Up., the verb \'to\nrinse\' is found in the injunctive form (\'therefore a man, &c., is to rinse\'),\nis already refuted by our showing that the act of rinsing the mouth is not a\nnew one (and therefore requires no Vedic injunction).\n\nFor the very reason that the text does not aim at enjoining the rinsing of the\nmouth, the Ka _n_ vas (in their recension of the B _ri_. Up.) conclude the\nchapter with the clause, \'They think,\' &c., and do not add the concluding\nclause of the Madhyandinas, \'Therefore a man,\' &c. From this we have to\nconclude that what is enjoined in the text of the Madhyandinas also is \'the\nknowledge of that,\' i.e. the knowledge of the water being the dress of the\npreviously mentioned pra _n_ a.--Nor finally can it be maintained that in one\nplace (i.e. the Madhyandina- _s_ akha) the rinsing of the mouth is enjoined,\nand in other places the knowledge of water as the dress of pra _n_ a; for the\nintroductory passage, \'Water is the dress,\' is the same everywhere.--We are\ntherefore entitled to conclude that what is enjoined in all _S_ akhas is the\ncognition of water being the dress of the pra _n_ a.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[212:1](sbe38161.htm#fr_139) A glorifying arthavada-passage would be in its\nplace only if it were preceded by some injunction; for the glorification of\ncertain acts is meant to induce men to comply with the injunctions concerning\nthose acts.\n\n[213:1](sbe38161.htm#fr_140) Because otherwise we should have only arthavadas.\nBut arthavadas have a meaning only in so far as connected with an injunction.\n\n[213:2](sbe38161.htm#fr_141) The above argumentation avails itself of the\nSutra, putting a new construction on it.--Tarhi dvayor avidheyatvam ity a _s_\na\xe1\xb9\x85kyanu-vadamatrasya\xe0\xa4\xbdki _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ itkaratvad anyataravidher ava _s_ yakatve\nsamkalpanam eva vidheyam iti vidhantare _n_ a sutra _m_ yo _g_ ayati. \xc3\x82n.
