Thereby those (theories) also which are not accepted by competent persons\nare explained.\n\nHitherto we have refuted those objections against the Vedanta-texts which,\nbased on reasoning, take their stand on the doctrine of the pradhana being the\ncause of the world; (which doctrine deserves to be refuted first), because it\nstands near to our Vedic system, is supported by somewhat weighty arguments,\nand has, to a certain extent, been adopted by some authorities who follow the\nVeda.--But now some dull-witted persons might think that another objection\nfounded on reasoning might be raised against the Vedanta, viz. on the ground\nof the atomic doctrine. The Sutrakara, therefore, extends to the latter\nobjection the refutation of the former, considering that by the conquest of\nthe most dangerous adversary the conquest of the minor enemies is already\nvirtually accomplished. Other doctrines, as, for instance, the atomic doctrine\nof which no part has been accepted by\n\np. 318\n\neither Manu or Vyasa or other authorities, are to be considered as\n'explained,' i.e. refuted by the same reasons which enabled us to dispose of\nthe pradhana doctrine. As the reasons on which the refutation hinges are the\nsame, there is no room for further doubt. Such common arguments are the\nimpotence of reasoning to fathom the depth of the transcendental cause of the\nworld, the ill-foundedness of mere Reasoning, the impossibility of final\nrelease, even in case of the conclusions being shaped 'otherwise' (see the\npreceding Sutra), the conflict of Scripture and Reasoning, and so on.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1, 13](sbe34152.htm)\n\n"
