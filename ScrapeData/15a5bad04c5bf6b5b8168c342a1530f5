This may well be a marvel, even to an intelligent man, that anything\nshould have taken the same name dhenu, cow:--the one is always brimming to\ngive milk among men, but P _ri_ _s_ ni (the cloud, the mother of the Maruts)\npoured out her bright udder once (only).\n\n2\\. The Maruts who shone like kindled fires, as they grew stronger twice and\nthrice,--their golden, dustless (chariots [1](sbe3245.htm#an_6:66:2:1)) became\nfull of manly courage and strength.\n\n3\\. They who [1](sbe3245.htm#an_6:66:3:1) are the sons of the bounteous Rudra,\nand whom she indeed was strong enough to bear; for she, the great, is known as\nthe mother of the great, that very P _ri_ _s_ ni conceived the germ for the\nstrong one (Rudra).\n\n4\\. They who do not shrink from being born in this way\n[1](sbe3245.htm#an_6:66:4:1), and who within (the womb) clean themselves from\nall impurity [2](sbe3245.htm#an_6:66:4:2), when they have been brought forth\nbrilliant, according to their pleasure, they sprinkle their bodies with\nsplendour.\n\n5\\. Among them there is no one who does not strive to be brought forth\nquickly; and they assume the defiant name of Maruts. They who are not (unkind\n[1](sbe3245.htm#an_6:66:5:1)), never tiring in strength\n[2](sbe3245.htm#an_6:66:5:2), will the generous sacrificer be able to bring\ndown these fierce ones?\n\n6\\. Fierce in strength, followed by daring armies, these Maruts have brought\ntogether heaven and earth [1](sbe3245.htm#an_6:66:6:1), both firmly\nestablished [2](sbe3245.htm#an_6:66:6:2); then the self-shining\n\np. 369\n\n[paragraph continues] Rodasi stood among the impetuous Maruts, like\n[3](sbe3245.htm#an_6:66:6:3) a light.\n\n7\\. Even though your carriage, O Maruts, be without your deer\n[1](sbe3245.htm#an_6:66:7:1), without horse's, and not driven by any\ncharioteer, without drag [2](sbe3245.htm#an_6:66:7:2), and without reins, yet,\ncrossing the air [3](sbe3245.htm#an_6:66:7:3), it passes between heaven and\nearth, finishing its courses.\n\n8\\. No one can stop, no one can overcome him whom you, O Maruts, protect in\nbattle. He whom you protect in his kith, his cattle, his kin, and his waters,\nhe breaks the stronghold at the close of the day [1](sbe3245.htm#an_6:66:8:1).\n\n9\\. Offer a beautiful song to the host of the Maruts, the singers, the quick,\nthe strong, who resist violence with violence; O Agni, the earth trembles\nbefore the champions.\n\n10\\. Blazing like the flame of the sacrifices, flickering like the tongues of\nthe fire, shouters, like roaring fighters, the flame-born Maruts are\nunassailable.\n\n11\\. I invite with my call this strong and Marut-like son of Rudra\n[1](sbe3245.htm#an_6:66:11:1), armed with flaming spears. Bright thoughts,\nlike wild waters from the mountain [2](sbe3245.htm#an_6:66:11:2), strove to\nreach the host of heaven.\n\np. 370\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nHymn ascribed to Bharadva _g_ a Barhaspatya. None of its verses occurs in SV.,\nVS., AV. Verse 2 in MS. IV, 14, 11. Verse 9 in TS. IV, 1, 11, 3; TB. II, 8, 5,\n5; MS. IV, 10, 3. Verse 10 in MS. IV, 14, 11. Metre, Trish _t_ ubh.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nThe meaning seems to be that it is strange that two things, namely, a real cow\nand the cloud, i. e. P _ri_ _s_ ni, the mother of the Maruts, should both be\ncalled dhenu, cow; that the one should always yield milk to men, while the\nother has her bright udder milked but once. This may mean that dhenu, a cow,\nyields her milk always, that dhenu, a cloud, yields rain but once, or, that P\n_ri_ _s_ ni gave birth but once to the Maruts. See also VI, 48, 22; Gaedicke,\nAccusativ, p. 19; Delbruck, Tempuslehre, p. 102. Dhenu must be taken as the\nneuter form, and as a nominative, as is shown by II, 37, 2. dadi _h_ ya _h_\nna\xc2\xb4ma patyate.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. It seems necessary to take are _n_ ava _h_ hira _n_ yayasa _h_ for\nratha _h_ , chariots, as in V, 87, 3. Saya _n_ a takes the same view, and I do\nnot see how the verse gives sense in any other way. The first pada might be\nreferred to the Maruts, or to the chariots.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. The relative pronouns may be supposed to carry on the subject, viz.\nMaruta _h_ , from the preceding verse, unless we supply esham mata\xc2\xb4. I am\ndoubtful about maho mahi\xc2\xb4; cf. I, 102, 1; II, 33, 8. Grassmann proposes to\nread maham, gen. plur.; Ludwig thinks of garbha. It may also be a compound, as\nin mahamaha, mahamahivrata, or an adverb, but the construction remains\ndifficult throughout. Oldenberg suggests that the second pada may have been\nyan _k_ o nu p _r i_ _s_ ni _h_ da\xc2\xb4dh _ri_ vi _h_ bharadhyai.\n\np. 371\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. A tentative rendering and no more. I take aya for aya as an adverb in\nthe sense of thus, in this way, see I, 87, 4, note 2. Grassmann seems to take\nit as an instr. fem., dependent on _g_ anusha _h_ , which is possible, but\nwithout analogy. Lanman, p. 358, takes it for aya _h_ , nom. plur. of aya,\nwanderer, and translates, 'as long as the ones now wanderers quit not their\nbirth.' Grassmann: 'Die nicht verleugnen die Geburt aus jener.' But is _g_ an\nwith instrumental ever used of a woman giving birth to a child? Ludwig: 'Die\nsich nicht weigern der geburt.'\n\nNote 2. Pu with accusative occurs AV. XIX, 33, 3.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nThis verse is again very obscure. It would be more honest to say that it is\nuntranslatable. Possibly the poet may have taken dohase in the same sense as\nduhre in verse 4. The Maruts are born as by being milked from the udder of P\n_ri_ _s_ ni. It would then mean, 'Among whom there is no one not striving to\nbe born quickly.'\n\nNote 1. Stauna is an unknown word. Saya _n_ a explains it as stena, thieves.\nIt probably meant something not favourable, something that must be denied of\nthe Maruts. This is all we can say. It cannot be a corruption of stavana _h_ ,\npraised.\n\nNote 2. Aya\xc2\xb4s can hardly refer to P _ri_ _s_ ni, never tiring to suckle the\nMaruts. In B.-R. ayas is explained as sich nicht anstrengend, behende, leicht,\nunermudlich. See also Windisch, K. Z. XXVII, 170; also Johansson, Bezzenb.\nBeitr. XV, p. 180.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. To join together heaven and earth is, as Bergaigne remarks (II, p.\n374, n. 1), the apparent effect of a thunderstorm, when the clouds cover both\nin impenetrable darkness. We have the same expression in VIII, 20, 4.\n\nNote 2. On sumeke, see Geldner, K. Z. XXIV, 145; and Windisch, Festgruss an\nBohtlingk, p. 114.\n\nNote 3. The na, placed before roka _h_ , is irregular, see Bergaigne, Melanges\nRenier, p. 79. Oldenberg suggests\n\np. 372\n\nnaroka _h_ = n _ri_ -oka _h_ , 'she who is fond of the men,' namely, of the\nMaruts. The corruption may be due to the writers of our text.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. Anena _h_ is strange, and might be changed into aneta _h_ ; it cannot\nbe anena\xc2\xb4 _h_ , without guilt.\n\nNote 2. If avasa in an-avasa comes from ava-so, it may mean the step for\ndescending or ascending, or possibly a drag. Bergaigne explains it by sine via\ntic o.\n\nNote 3. Ra _g_ a _h_ -tu\xc2\xb4 _h_ , according to Ludwig, den Staub aufwirbelnd,\nwhich seems too much opposed to are _n_ u, dustless. Ra _g_ as + tar means to\npass through the air, and in that sense only conquering the air. Geldner, Ved.\nStud. p. 123, ignores the various shades of meaning in tur at the end of\ncompounds.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. Pa\xc2\xb4rye dyo _h_ , according to Grassmann, 'on the decisive day,' like\npa\xc2\xb4rye divi.\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. I have translated Rudrasya sunum by the son of Rudra. It is true that\na single Marut, as the son of Rudra, is not mentioned; but on the other hand,\none could hardly call the whole company of the Maruts, the maruta scil. ga _n_\na, the son of Rudra. In I, 64, 12, we have Rudrasya sunu in one pada, and\nmaruta ga _n_ a in the next. The _Ri_ bhus also are called in the same line\n_s_ avasa _h_ napata _h_ , and indrasya suno, IV, 37, 4. Here sunu corresponds\nalmost to the English offspring, only it is masculine.\n\nNote 2. Giraya _h_ may have been meant for girya _h_ , a possible ablative of\ngiri; see Lanman, p. 383. Ugra\xc2\xb4 _h_ would then refer to a\xc2\xb4pa _h_ , unless we\nbreak the sentence into two, viz. 'my bright thoughts tend to the host of\nheaven,' and the fierce Maruts strive like waters from the mountain.' If we\ncompare, however, IX, 95, 3. apa\xc2\xb4m iva id urmaya _h_ tartura _n_ a _h_ pra\nmanisha\xc2\xb4 _h_ irate somam a _k_ _kh_ a, we see that the whole verse forms one\nsentence. All would be right if we could change giraya _h_ into giribhya _h_ ,\nbut is not this a conjecture nimis facilis?\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII, 56. To the Maruts (the Storm-gods)](sbe3246.htm)\n\n"
