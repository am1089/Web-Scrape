Vyasa said :-- O King! The messenger was thunderstruck with Devi\xc2\x92s words\nand said :-- \xc2\x93O Beautiful Lady! What art Thou speaking? It seems that Thou\ndost not think on this matter, owing to Thy feminine nature. O Devi! Thou art\nboasting in vain; how canst Thou expect to conquer S\xc2\x92umbha in a battle when he\nhas conquered Indra and other Devas and many other Danavas? Lotus-eyed One!\nThere is no hero in the three worlds that can conquer S\xc2\x92umbha in battle; Thou\nseemest to be a mere trifle before that King of Demons in a face-to-face\nfight. O Fair One! Nowhere ought to be said any words without being thought\nover; one must weigh one\xc2\x92s own and other\xc2\x92s might and then speak accordingly.\nThe King S\xc2\x92umbha, the Lord of the three worlds, enchanted by Thy fascinating\nbeauty, is desirous of Thee; therefore dost Thou fulfill his desires and\nbecome his beloved wife. Thou better now abandonest Thy illiterate nature and\nworhippest S\xc2\x92umbha or Nis\xc2\x92umbha; I am speaking for Thy good; so keep my words.\nThe amorous love sentiment is the best of nine prevailing sentiments.\nTherefore every intelligent being ought to cherish with gladness this amorous\nfeeling. And if Thou, O Weak girl! dost not go to S\xc2\x92umbha, then that Lord of\nthe Earth will become very angry and will order his servants to take Thee\nperforce before him. O Fair One! Those proud Demons will carry Thee by holding\nThy hair before S\xc2\x92umbha; there is no doubt in this. O thin bodied One! Better\nforego Thy boldness in every way and keep Thy self-respect. Thou art the\nobject of respect and admiration and so should go before him. What difference\nis there between the fight which makes one\xc2\x92s body liable to cuts and wounds by\nsharp arrows and pleasures that arise out of sexual intercourse! These are\nlike the two opposite poles; therefore judge what is useless and what is\nuseful and keep my good advice. Thou shalt be exceedingly happy if Thou\nservest S\xc2\x92umbha or Nis\xc2\x92umbha.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n13-19. The Devi spoke :-- \xc2\x93O Messenger! You are fortunate; you are well\ntrained to speak out truth; I know full well that S\xc2\x92umbha and Nis\xc2\x92umbha are\nstrong. Still out of My childish nature, the promise that I made before I\ncannot undo it. Therefore speak to the powerful S\xc2\x92umbha or Nis\xc2\x92umbha that none\ncan be my husband simply from his beauty without defeating Me in battle no one\ncan marry Me. So conquer Me soon and marry Me as you like. Though of a weaker\nsex, I have come here\n\n\n\np. 438\n\n\n\nto fight; know this as certain. Therefore if you be capable, fight and do the\nduty of a warrior. And if you be terrified by seeing my trident or if you want\nyour life, quit the Heavens and this earth and go down to Patala without any\ndelay. O Messenger! Go just now to your master and tell him sweetly these\nwords. Then that powerful Lord of the Danavas will judge what ought to be\ndone. O Knower of Dharma! To speak out truth before an enemy, before one\xc2\x92s own\nmaster is certainly the duty of a messenger in this world; therefore go\nquickly and tell him what are verily true.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n20-21. Vyasa said :-- O King! The messenger was quite surprised to hear the\nbold words, though full of reason and morals, of the Devi, puffed up by the\nvanity of Her strength and departed. Coming to the Lord of the Daityas, the\nmessenger bowed down before his feet and told him sweet words, full of morals,\nin a very humble way after pondering over and over again what he would say.\n\n\n\n22-29. The messenger said :-- O King! Words, true and the same time sweet,\nought to be spoken before one\xc2\x92s master; but these are very rare in this world.\nOn the other hand, if unpleasant words be spoken, the King gets very angry. So\nI am very anxious now. O King! Whether that lady is weak or strong, whence has\nShe come, whose wife is She, I have not been able to ascertain all these. How\nthen can I say about Her conduct? But, on seeing that harsh speaking woman, I\nhave come to understand this much that She is exceedingly haughty and has come\nto fight. O King! You are very intelligent; therefore judge what ought to be\ndone after hearing only what that lady has told me to speak to you. That Lady\nsaid :-- \xc2\x93In days of childhood, while I was playing, out of my childish\nnature, I promised before my comrades that I would marry that valiant warrior\nwho would defeat me thoroughly in a battle and thus curb My pride. O best of\nkings! You are religious; so you ought to make My word turn out false. Bring\nMe under your control by defeating Me in a battle.\xc2\x94 O King! Hearing these\nwords I have returned; now do whatever you like. That Lady is determined to\nfight and is waiting there, firmly mounted on a lion, and with various weapons\nin Her hands. Now judge and do what is best.\n\n\n\n30\\. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing thus the words of Sugriva, the king\nS'umbha asked his hero brother Nis\xc2\x92umbha who was close by.\n\n\n\n31-32. O Brother! You are intelligent; speak out truly what ought to be done\nnow? The lovely woman is challenging us to fight. Shall I go to fight or you\nwould go with forces? I will do whatever you say.\n\n\n\np. 439\n\n\n\n33-34. Nis\xc2\x92umbha said :-- O King! It is not proper that you or I would go to\nthe battlefield. Better send Dhumralochana to the field quickly. Let that hero\ngo there and defeat that beautiful Lady and bring Her here. You can then marry\nHer.\n\n\n\n35\\. Vyasa said :-- Hearing thus his younger brother\xc2\x92s words, S\xc2\x92umbha filled\nwith anger, instantly sent Dhumralochana who was close by to battle.\n\n\n\n36-40. S\xc2\x92umbha said :-- \xc2\x93O Dhumralochana! Take a vast army and go at once to\nthe battlefield and bring that stupid Lady, vainly boasting of Her strength.\nIf any Deva, Danava or any other powerful human being take Her side, kill him\ninstantly. Slay Her companion the Goddess Kali and bring Her too. Do all these\nresponsible duties and return quickly. That Chaste Lady is to be protected by\nall means. The body of that thin Lady is very delicate; so shoot arrows at Her\nvery carefully and see that they are not sharp. But kill those that will help\nHer with weapons in their hands. Try your best to protect Her, never to kill\nHer.\n\n\n\n41-60. Vyasa said :-- O King! No sooner ordered thus by the king,\nDhumralochana bowed down to the king, and, accompanied by sixty thousand\nDanava forces, quickly went to the battlefield and saw there that the Lady was\nsitting in a beautiful garden. Seeing that deer-eyed Lady, Dhumralochana began\nto address Her with great humility and in sweet words full of reason and\ngoodness. O Devi! O highly Fortunate One! Hear! S\xc2\x92umbha is very much\ndistressed owing to Thy absence. Lest there be any break in the love\nsentiments, that King, a wise statesman, sent a messenger with instructions to\nspeak Thee in sweet and suitable terms; but, O fair One! That messenger, on\narriving before the King had told all the contrary words. O Knower of love\nsentiments! Hearing thus the messenger\xc2\x92s words, my lord S\xc2\x92umbha, sick with\nlove, has become immersed in cares and anxieties. That messenger had not been\nable to realise the true meaning of Thy words. O honourable Lady! The sentence\nuttered by Thee, \xc2\x93He who will conquer me in battle\xc2\x94 is full of deep meanings;\nhe was stupid; hence he could not realise the meaning of the word \xc2\x93battle\xc2\x94\nintended by Thee. O Beautiful One! \xc2\x93Battle\xc2\x94 means two different things\naccording to persons for whom it is intended; it is of two kinds :-- One out\nof excitement and another out of sexual intercourse. With Thee, the sexual\nintercourse is intended; and with any other enemy, excitement in a real fight\nis meant. Out of these, the fight of sexual intercourse is full of sweetness\nand the fight with enemies is painful. O Beautiful One! I know Thy intentions\nfully. In Thy heart reigns\n\n\n\np. 440\n\n\n\nthat fight of sexual intercourse. Knowing me as expert in these affairs, the\nking S\xc2\x92umbha has sent me today to Thee with a vast army. O highly Fortunate\nLady! Thou art clever and shrewd; hear my gentle words; serve S\xc2\x92umbha, the\nlord of the three worlds, the destroyer of the Deva\xc2\x92s pride. Thou wilt be the\ndearest queen-consort and enjoy the best pleasures. The powerful S\xc2\x92umbha knows\nthe real meaning of the fight of sexual intercourse; so he will easily conquer\nThee. When Thou wilt shew various amorous gestures, he will also show his\nfeelings. And the Kalika Devi, your companion will remain with Thee as a\nhelping mate in your vital pleasures. The lord of the Daityas, expert in the\nscience of love, will certainly conquer Thee engaged in amorous fight and will\nlay Thee stretched on a soft bedding and will make Thee tired; he will make\nThy body covered with blood by striking with nails and he will bite Thy lips\nto pieces; then Thou wilt perspire profusely and wilt cease fighting. Thus Thy\nmental desire for fight - sexual intercourse - will be satisfied. O Beloved!\nAt Thy mere sight S\xc2\x92umbha will be completely subject to Thee. Therefore dost\nThou keep my sweet and beneficial words. Thou art an honourable Lady; and Thou\nwilt be highly honoured by all if Thou marryest S\xc2\x92umbha. Those are certainly\nvery unfortunate who like fighting with weapons. O Beloved! The sexual\nintercourse is always favourite to Thee; therefore it is not worthy of Thee to\nfight with weapons. Therefore dost Thou make the king free of sorrows by\npouring on him Thy mouth nectar and by making his heart bud forth by Thy\nkicking, as Bakula and Kurubaka trees blossom forth when drenched with mouth\nnectar and Asoka tree gets blossomed by the kicking of women.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-fourth Chapter of the Fifth Book on the description and\nDhumralochana giving the news in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, the Maha Pura _n_\nam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 25](bk05ch25.htm)\n\n"
