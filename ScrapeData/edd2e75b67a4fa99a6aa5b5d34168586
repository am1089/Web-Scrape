Prayer for health and long life.\n\n1\\. I release thee unto life by means of (my) oblation, from unknown decline,\nand from consumption. If Grahi (seizure) has caught hold (gagraha) of this\nperson here, may Indra and Agni free him from that!  \n2\\. If his life has faded, even if he has passed away, if he has been brought\nto the very vicinity of death, I snatch him from the lap of Nirriti (the\ngoddess of destruction): I have freed him unto a life of a hundred autumns.  \n3\\. I have snatched him (from death) by means of an oblation which has a\nthousand eyes, hundredfold strength, and -ensures a hundredfold life, in order\nthat Indra may conduct him through the years across to the other side of every\nmisfortune.  \n4\\. Live thou, thriving a hundred autumns, a hundred winters, and a hundred\nsprings! May Indra, Agni, Savitar, Brihaspati (grant) thee a hundred years! I\nhave snatched him (from death) with an oblation that secures a life,of a\nhundred years.  \n5\\. Enter ye, O in-breathirig and out-breathing, as two bulls a stable! Away\nshall go the other deaths, of which, it is said, there are a hundred more!  \n6\\. Remain ye here, O in-breathing and out-breathing, do not go away from\nhere; do ye car anew to old age his body and his limbs!  \n7\\. To old age I make thee over, into old age I urge thee; may a happy old age\nguide thee! Away shall go the other deaths, of which, it is said, there are a\nhundred more!  \n8\\. Upon thee (life unto) old age has been deposited, as a rope is tied upon a\nbull. That death which has fettered thee at thy birth with a firm rope,\nBrihaspati with the hands of the truth did strip off from thee.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 28.
