On account of the connexion (with passages treating of Brahman, the\npassages speaking of the Non-being do not intimate absolute Non-existence).\n\nThe passage 'Non-being indeed was this in the beginning' (Taitt. Up. II, 7)\ndoes not declare that the cause of the world is the absolutely Non-existent\nwhich is devoid of all Selfhood. For in the preceding sections of the\nUpanishad Brahman is distinctly denied to be the Non-existing, and is defined\nto be that which is ('He who knows the Brahman as non-existing becomes himself\nnon-existing.\n\np. 267\n\n[paragraph continues] He who knows the Brahman as existing him we know himself\nas existing'); it is further, by means of the series of sheaths, viz. the\nsheath of food, &c., represented as the inner Self of everything. This same\nBrahman is again referred to in the clause, 'He wished, may I be many;' is\ndeclared to have originated the entire creation; and is finally referred to in\nthe clause, 'Therefore the wise call it the true.' Thereupon the text goes on\nto say, with reference to what has all along been the topic of discussion, 'On\nthis there is also this _s_ loka, Non-being indeed was this in the beginning,'\n&c.--If here the term 'Non-being' denoted the absolutely Non-existent, the\nwhole context would be broken; for while ostensibly referring to one matter\nthe passage would in reality treat of a second altogether different matter. We\nhave therefore to conclude that, while the term 'Being' ordinarily denotes\nthat which is differentiated by names and forms, the term 'Non-being' denotes\nthe same substance previous to its differentiation, i.e. that Brahman is, in a\nsecondary sense of the word, called Non-being, previously to the origination\nof the world. The same interpretation has to be applied to the passage 'Non-\nbeing this was in the beginning' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 19, 1); for that passage\nalso is connected with another passage which runs, 'It became being;' whence\nit is evident that the 'Non-being' of the former passage cannot mean absolute\nNon-existence. And in the passage, 'Others say, Non-being this was in the\nbeginning' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 2, 1), the reference to the opinion of 'others'\ndoes not mean that the doctrine referred, to (according to which the world was\noriginally absolutely non-existent) is propounded somewhere in the Veda; for\noption is possible in the case of actions but not in the case of substances.\nThe passage has therefore to be looked upon as a refutation of the tenet of\nprimitive absolute non-existence as fancifully propounded by some teachers of\ninferior intelligence; a refutation undertaken for the purpose of\nstrengthening the doctrine that this world has sprung from that which is.--The\nfollowing passage again, 'Now this was then undeveloped,' &c. (B _ri_. Up. I,\n4, 7), does not by any means assert that the evolution of\n\np. 268\n\nthe world took place without a ruler; as we conclude from the circumstance of\nits being connected with another passage in which the ruler is represented as\nentering into the evolved world of effects, 'He entered thither to the very\ntips of the finger-nails' &c. If it were supposed that the evolution of the\nworld takes place without a ruler, to whom could the subsequent pronoun 'he'\nrefer (in the passage last quoted) which manifestly is to be connected with\nsomething previously intimated? And as Scripture declares that the Self, after\nhaving entered into the body, is of the nature of intelligence ('when seeing,\neye by name; when hearing, ear by name; when thinking, mind by name'), it\nfollows that it is intelligent at the time of its entering also.--We,\nmoreover, must assume that the world was evolved at the beginning of the\ncreation in the same way as it is at present seen to develop itself by names\nand forms, viz. under the rulership of an intelligent creator; for we have no\nright to make assumptions contrary to what is at present actually observed.\nAnother scriptural passage also declares that the evolution of the world took\nplace under the superintendence of a ruler, 'Let me now enter these beings\nwith this living Self, and let me then evolve names and forms' ( _Kh_. Up. VI,\n3, 2). The intransitive expression 'It developed itself' (vyakriyata; it\nbecame developed) is to be viewed as having reference to the ease with which\nthe real agent, viz. the Lord, brought about that evolution. Analogously it is\nsaid, for instance, that 'the cornfield reaps itself' (i.e. is reaped with the\ngreatest ease), although there is the reaper sufficient (to account for the\nwork being done).--Or else we may look on the form vyakriyata as having\nreference to a necessarily implied agent; as is the case in such phrases as\n'the village is being approached' (where we necessarily have to supply 'by\nDevadatta or somebody else').\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4, 16](sbe34127.htm)\n\n"
