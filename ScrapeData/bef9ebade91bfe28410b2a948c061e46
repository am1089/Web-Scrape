The Skanda Puran\xcc\x81a\n\n13\\. Skanda Puran\xcc\x81a. "The Skanda Puran\xcc\x81a is that in which the six-faced deity\n(Skanda) has related the events of the Tatpurusha Kalpa, enlarged with many\ntales, and subservient to the duties taught by Mahe\xc5\x9bwara. It is said to\ncontain eighty-one thousand one hundred stanzas: so it is asserted amongst\nmankind  70."\n\np. xlvi\n\nIt is uniformly agreed that the Skanda Puran\xcc\x81a in a collective form has no\nexistence; and the fragments in the shape of Sanhitas, Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81as, and\nMahatmyas, which are affirmed in various parts of India to be portions of the\nPuran\xcc\x81a, present a much more formidable mass of stanzas than even the immense\nnumber of which it is said to consist. The most celebrated of these portions\nin Hindustan is the Ka\xc5\x9bi Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, a very minute description of the temples of\n\xc5\x9aiva in or adjacent to Benares, mixed with directions for worshipping\nMahe\xc5\x9bwara, and a great variety of legends explanatory of its merits, and of\nthe holiness of Ka\xc5\x9bi: many of them are puerile and uninteresting, but some are\nof a higher character. The story of Agastya records probably, in a legendary\nstyle, the propagation of Hinduism in the south of India: and in the history\nof Divodasa, king of Ka\xc5\x9bi, we have an embellished tradition of the temporary\ndepression of the worship of \xc5\x9aiva, even in its metropolis, before the\nascendancy of the followers of Buddha 71, There is every reason to believe the\ngreater part of the contents of the Ka\xc5\x9bi Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a anterior to the first attack\nupon Benares by Mahmud of Ghizni. The Ka\xc5\x9bi Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a alone contains fifteen\nthousand stanzas.\n\nAnother considerable work ascribed in upper India to the Skanda Puran\xcc\x81a is the\nUtkala Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, giving an account of the holiness of Urissa, and the Kshetra\nof Purushottama or Jagannatha. The same vicinage is the site of temples, once\nof great magnificence and extent, dedicated to \xc5\x9aiva, as Bhuvane\xc5\x9bwara, which\nforms an excuse for attaching an account of a Vaishn\xcc\x81ava Tirtha to an\neminently \xc5\x9aaiva Puran\xcc\x81a. There can be little doubt, however, that the Utkala\nKhan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a is unwarrantably included amongst the progeny of the parent work.\nBesides these, there is a Brahmottara Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, a Reva Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, a \xc5\x9aiva\nRahasya Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, a Himavat Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, and others. Of the Sanhitas, the chief\nare the Suta Sanhita, Sanatkumara Sanhita, Saura Sanhita, and Kapila Sanhita:\nthere are several other works denominated Sanhitas. The\n\np. xlvii\n\n[paragraph continues] Mahatmyas are more numerous still 72. According to the\nSuta Sanhita, as quoted by Col. Vans Kennedy 73, the Skanda Puran\xcc\x81a contains\nsix Sanhitas, five hundred Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81as, and five hundred thousand stanzas; more\nthan is even attributed to all the Puran\xcc\x81as. He thinks, judging from internal\nevidence, that all the Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81as and Sanhitas may be admitted to be genuine,\nthough the Mahatmyas have rather a questionable appearance. Now one kind of\ninternal evidence is the quantity; and as no more than eighty-one thousand one\nhundred stanzas have ever been claimed for it, all in excess above that amount\nmust be questionable. But many of the Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81as, the Ka\xc5\x9bi Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a for\ninstance, are quite as local as the Mahatmyas, being legendary stories\nrelating to the erection and sanctity of certain temples or groups of temples,\nand to certain Lingas; the interested origin of which renders them very\nreasonably objects of suspicion. In the present state of our acquaintance with\nthe reputed portions of the Skanda Puran\xcc\x81a, my own views of their authenticity\nare so opposed to those entertained by Col. Vans Kennedy, that instead of\nadmitting all the Sanhitas and Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81as to be genuine, I doubt if any one of\nthem was ever a part of the Skanda Puran\xcc\x81a.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xlv:70](vp017.htm#fr_69) [![](tn/generic.jpg)  \nClick to view](img/_04500.jpg)\n\n[xlvi:71](vp017.htm#fr_70) The legend is translated by Col.
