Suta said :-- Here, on the other hand, one day the boy Rohitas\xc2\x92va went\nout with other boys to play at some place close to Ka _s_ \xc2\x92i. He first played\nwith the his comrades; he then began to root out and collect, as far as he\ncould, the Darbha (Kus\xc2\x92a) grass, with its ends and which had not deep roots.\nOn being questioned why he was taking the Dharba grass, Rohita told his\ncomrades that his master was a Brahmi _n_ and that he was collecting them for\nhis satisfaction. Saying this,\n\n\n\np. 675\n\n\n\nhe began to collect carefully by his hands the sacrificial fuel (Samidha) and\nother fuel for the burning purposes. He collected the Palasa wood for Homa\npurpose and making it into a bundle with other articles already collected,\ntook it on his head, but at every step he seemed to be fatigued. Feeling\nthirsty he went to a pool of water close by and keeping his load on the ground\nwent down to drink water. Drinking water he rested a while and then as he had\nkept his load on the anthill, be began to take it back on his head, a very\npoisonous deadly serpent came out suddenly out of that anthill at the order of\nVis\xc2\x92vamitra. The snake immediately bit the boy who instantly fell down and\ndied. His comrades seeing Rohitas\xc2\x92va dead went to the house of the Brahmi _n_.\nWith much anxiety the boys went soon out of fear, to his mother and said :--\n\xc2\x93O Brahmi _n_ \xc2\x92s maidservant! Your son went out with us to play outside; but\nsuddenly a poisonous snake bit him and he is dead.\xc2\x94 Rohita\xc2\x92s mother, hearing\nthese cruel words like thunder and lightning at once fell down on the ground\nlike a plantain tree, cut off from its roots. The Brahmi _n_ , then, came and\nsprinkled water on her face. When she regained her consciousness, the Brahmi\n_n_ then angrily spoke :--\n\n\n\n13-19. O wicked One! It is very inauspicious to cry at the evening time;\nespecially the disfavour of the Goddess Lak _s_ mi; the poverty comes to the\nhouseholder, you know this; why are you then weeping? Have you not a bit of\nshame in your heart? She made no reply at this. Rather very much immersed in\ngrief for her son, she wept in a pitiful voice. Her body was covered with\ndust, hairs were dishevelled and her face covered all over with tears from\neyes. She constantly wept out of sorrow. The Brahmi _n_ , then, became very\nangry and spoke to the queen :-- \xc2\x93O Villain! O Wicked! Fie on you. I have\nbought you for money; yet you are hindering my luck. If you had this thought\nthat you would not work under me, why did you take for nothing my money?\xc2\x94 Thus\nrepeatedly scolded by the Brahmi _n_ , she pitifully cried and spoke to the\nBrahmi _n_ in a voice choked with feelings :-- \xc2\x93O Lord! My son has fallen into\nthe jaws of death, being smitten by a serpent. O One of good vows! I will\nnever be able to see him. So kindly permit me to go and see my boy.\xc2\x94 Saying\nthus, that lady began again to weep in a pitiful voice. The Brahmi _n_ became\nvery angry and spoke thus :--\n\n\n\n20-26. O Cheat! Your conduct is extremely blameable; you do not know how one\ncommits a sin. The man who taking his pay from his master spoils his master\xc2\x92s\nwork, he goes to the terrible hell Raurava and is being scorched there. Living\nin the Hell for a short while, he is born as a cock. Or it is useless for me\nto give you this instruction of the Dharma S\xc2\x92astra, for to speak to such to an\nilliterate, cruel, low, hypocrite\n\n\n\np. 676\n\n\n\nand liar and to one addicted to sinful acts is to sow seed on an usar land and\nto see it fruitless. Now if you have any fear for the afterlife, come and do\nthe household affairs. Hearing this, she said to the Brahmi _n_ , trembling\n:-- \xc2\x93O Lord! Be graciously pleased and shew your mercy on a maidservant. Only\nfor a moment I will go to see the dead son of mine; so give me order to go\nthere for a moment.\xc2\x94 That lady was deeply absorbed with sorrows for her son;\nthen she put her head on the feet of the Brahmi _n_ and with a pitiful voice\ncried. The angry Brahmi _n_ with eyes reddened then began to speak.\n\n\n\n27-41. What purpose of mine will be served by your son? Don\xc2\x92t you know about\nmy anger? Have you forgotten about my whipping? So be ready and do my\nhousehold work without any delay. Hearing his words, the queen held her\npatience and began to do the household work. She spent half the night time,\nwhen she finished champooing his feet. When this was over, the Brahmi _n_\nspoke to her :-- \xc2\x93You can go now to your son; but see, finish his burning\nceremonies and come back quickly. See that my morning works do not suffer.\xc2\x94\nThus getting the permission, the Queen went at that dead of night to look for\nher son, alone and weeping. Gradually she went out of the precincts of the\ncity of Ka _s_ i and there she saw her son like a poor man\xc2\x92s son lying on the\nground over leaves and pieces of woods. Seeing her son dead, the humble Queen\nwas very troubled with sorrow like an antelope, straying from its herd and as\na cow missing her calf. The Queen Madhavi then began to lament, in a very\npitiful tone, thus :-- \xc2\x93O my Son! Come once before me; say why you are angry.\nOh! My child! You used to come frequently to me, uttering Ma! Ma! Then why are\nyou not coming now?\xc2\x94 Saying thus, she tumbling went and fell over his son.\nShe, regaining her consciousness, embraced her son and placing her face on the\nface of the child began to weep pitifully. \xc2\x93Oh! My son! Oh! My child! Oh my\nKumara! Oh! My Beautiful! and began to beat her head and her breast with her\nhands. O King! Where are you now? You used to look upon your son dearer than\neven your life. Your that son is now lying dead on the ground. Come and behold\nhim once. It seems that the son has got back his life.\xc2\x94 Thus thinking she\nlooked upon his face; but when it looked dead, she fell immediately\nunconscious. Getting back soon her consciousness, she held his face by her\nhands and said :-- \xc2\x93O Child! Rise up from your sleep; awake; now is the\ndreadful night time; hundreds of jackals are yelling into our ears. Even\nPretas, Bhutas, Pis\xc2\x92achas and Dakinis are roaming in packs and making terrible\nsounds Hum, Hum. Your comrades returned to their homes just at sunset; Why are\nyou alone remaining here?\n\n\n\np. 677\n\n\n\n42-56. Suta said :-- The thin-bodied queen, thus saying, began to lament, \xc2\x93Oh\nmy Child! Oh! My son, Oh! Rohitas\xc2\x92va, O Kumara, why are you not replying to my\nwords! Oh my Child! I am your mother; do you not recognise me; look at me\nonce. O Child! I am deprived of my kingdom and exiled from my country; my\nhusband has sold even his body and I am myself reduced to slavery. What man is\nthere that can live in this state! I am living simply by seeing your lotus-\nface. The astrologer who cast your horoscope at your birth, calculated future\nevents in your life; but where? none of them is fructified. They said that\nthis child will be a hero, warrior, long-lived, very charitable man, and\nalways ready to do the worship of the Devas, Dvijas and the Gurus. What more\nthan this that the child will be one paramount sovereign and with his sons and\ngrandsons will enjoy his kingdom. This boy will be the master of his senses\nand will fulfil the desires of his father and mother. Oh my Son! Now all those\npredictions have turned out false. O Child! You have on your palms so many\nauspicious signs, discus, fishes, umbrella, S\xc2\x92ri Vatsa, Svastika, flags,\nKalas\xc2\x92a (earthen jar), Chamara and other signs; besides these, various other\nauspicious omens exist on your hands. Are all these become in vain today! O\nSon! You are the Lord of this whole dominion; but where are your that Kingdom\nnow, those ministers, that royal throne, that umbrella, that axe, that vast\namount of riches, that Ayodhya city, those palatial buildings, those\nelephants, horses, and chariots? Where have gone your subjects! O Child! Where\nhave you gone now, quitting all these and even me! O beloved Husband! See the\ncondition of your son who in his early childhood used to move on all fours\n(the hands and feet) and get up on your broad chest, anointed with Kumkum, and\nspoil it with dust; O King! Come once and witness the condition of your child\nwho used to press, out of ignorance due to his young age, the Tilak on your\nforehead, prepared of Mriganabhi, (musk). Alas! Flies are now sitting on the\nlotus face today which I used to kiss over, covered with dirt; the insects are\nnow stinging that. Oh! This I have got to witness now! O King! Come and see\nonce your child is now sleeping on the ground like a poor man\xc2\x92s dead son. O\nFate! What bad act did I commit in my past life, that I have got to suffer so\nmuch in this life and I do not get an end of them! O Child! O Son! Oh, my\nKumara! Oh! My Beautiful! Shall I not be able to see you once any more\nelsewhere?\xc2\x94 The Queen Madhavi thus lamented very much when the warders of the\ncity, hearing her lamentations awoke and came to her without any delay,\ngreatly astonished. They asked her thus :--\n\n\n\np. 678\n\n\n\n57-77. Who are you? Whose son is this? Where is your husband? Why are you\nweeping here in this dead of night, without any fear? Though thus questioned,\nthe thin Queen did not reply anything. Being again asked, she remained silent;\nand in the next moment she was pained with extreme agony and began again to\ncry. Tears flowed incessantly from her two eyes out of her sorrow. The guards\nthen began to suspect her and were greatly afraid. So much that hairs stood on\ntheir ends out of terror. They at once raised their arms and began to talk\nwith each other. When this lady is not giving any sort of reply, she is then\ncertainly not a woman; most probably she will be a Rak _s_ asi, knowing magic\nand destroying young children. So she should be killed with great attention.\nIf she be not a Rak _s_ asi, then why she should stay in this dead of night\noutside the city? No doubt, this Rak _s_ asi has brought someone\xc2\x92s child to\neat here. Thus saying, they, without any delay, tied her hairs closely and\nsome caught hold of her hand and some caught hold of her neck, saying O Rak\n_s_ asi! where will you go now? The armed men, then dragged her perforce to\nthe house of the Cha _nd_ ala and handed her over to him. All the people said\n:-- \xc2\x93O Chief of the Cha _nd_ alas! We have caught today outside the city this\nchild eating Rak _s_ asi; so you better take her quickly on the slaughter\nground and slaughter her.\xc2\x94 The Cha _nd_ ala looked at her body and said, \xc2\x93This\nRak _s_ asi is widely celebrated in this world. I know her from before; but\nnobody is able to see her. This Mayavini has devoured many sons of many\npersons. You all will acquire great merit when she will be slaughtered and\nyour good name will be known to all and will last long. You better now go back\nto your own homes. The man who kills women, children, cows and Brahmi _n_ s,\nwho burns another\xc2\x92s house with fire, who destroys the wayfares of others, who\nsteals his Guru\xc2\x92s wife, who quarrels with saintly persons, and who drinks\nwine, if killed, will certainly yield merits to the man who kills him. If such\na one be a female or a Brahmi _n_ , no sin will accrue if he or she be\nslaughtered.\n\n\n\nSo it is my paramount duty to kill her.\xc2\x94 Saying this, the Cha _nd_ ala tied\nher closely and drawing her by her hairs, began to beat her with a rope. Then\nhe told to Haris\xc2\x92chandra in terse language :-- \xc2\x93O Slave! Kill her; this woman\nis by her very nature wicked; so do not judge anything in this matter of\nkilling her.\xc2\x94 Hearing these harsh words, like the falling of a thunderbolt,\nthe King shuddered. When he came back to his nature, he fearing lest a woman\nbe killed, said to the Cha _nd_ ala :-- \xc2\x93I am not at all able to carry this\norder out; so kindly make over this task to some other servant of yours. He\nwill kill her. I will certainly carry out any other order that you would task\nme to do.\xc2\x94 Thus hearing\n\n\n\np. 679\n\n\n\nthe King, the Cha _nd_ ala said :-- Discard your fear and take the sword; this\nMayavini kills always the children; so to kill her is meritorious; in no way\nwhatsoever ought she to be saved. The King became very sorry and said :--\nWomen should always be protected with care, never to be killed; the more so as\nthe religious Munis have assigned greater sin in the killing of women. The man\nwho kills consciously or unconsciously females, certainly becomes boiled in\nthe Maha Raurava hell.\n\n\n\n78-79. The Cha _nd_ ala said :-- \xc2\x93Don\xc2\x92t you say this; take this sharp sword,\nlustrous like a lightning; where killing one engenders happiness to many,\nabundance of merits are acquired in doing that. This wicked fellow has eaten\nmany children of this place; so kill her as early as possible and bring peace\nand happiness to the Ka _s_ i people.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n80\\. The King said :-- \xc2\x93O Chief of the Cha _nd_ alas! I have taken the\ndifficult vow from my childhood, not to kill any woman. Therefore I cannot\nexert myself in this matter of killing the woman as you order.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n81-82. The Cha _nd_ ala said :-- \xc2\x93O Wicked Fellow! No work is superior which\nis not the master\xc2\x92s work. Why then are you cancelling today to carry out my\norder, when you are taking pay from me. The servant that spoils his master\xc2\x92s\nwork, taking his money, is not freed from the hell even if he remains for ten\nthousand years there.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n83-86. The King said :-- \xc2\x93O Lord of the Cha _nd_ alas! Put me to some other\ntask that is very difficult. I will do that easily. Or if you have an enemy,\nspecify and I will kill him no doubt within an instant. I will give you the\nwhole earth by killing him. Even if Indra comes against you with the other\nDevas, or Danavas, or Uragas, or Kinnaras, or Siddhas, or Gandharbas, I will\nslay him with my sharpened arrows, but I will never be able to kill a woman.\xc2\x94\nThe Cha _nd_ ala, then, began to tremble with anger at these words and said to\nthe King.\n\n\n\n87-89. You are a servant and what you have spoken is not fit for a servant.\nWorking as a slave of a Cha _nd_ ala, you are speaking the words of the gods.\nTherefore, O slave! hear now what I say; no need of exchanging any further\nwords. O Shameless One! If you fear sin a bit why then did you accept the\nslavery in a Cha _nd_ ala\xc2\x92s house. Take this sword and cut off her head.\xc2\x94 Thus\nspeaking the Cha _nd_ ala gave him the axe.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-fifth Chapter of the Seventh Book on the quarrels between\nHaris\xc2\x92chandra and Vis\xc2\x92vamitra in the Maha Pura _n_ am, S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam, of 18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 26](bk07ch26.htm)\n\n'
