The well known and beautiful\nepisode is in the fourth. the fifth, and the sixth books.\n\n[2] This ceremony will be explained in a future page.\n\n[3] A common exclamation of sorrow, surprise, fear, and other emotions. It is\nespecially used by women.\n\n[4] Quoted from view of the Hindoos, by William Ward, of Serampore (vol. i. p.\n25).\n\n[5] In Sanskrit, Vetala-pancha-Vinshati. "Baital" is the modern form of "\nVetala.\n\n[6] In Arabic, Badpai el Hakim.\n\n[7] Dictionnaire philosophique sub v. " Apocryphes."\n\n[8] I do not mean that rhymes were not known before the days of Al-Islam, but\nthat the Arabs popularized assonance and consonance in Southern Europe.\n\n[9] "Vikrama" means "valour " or " prowess."\n\n[10] Mr. Ward of Serampore is unable to quote the names of more than nine out\nof the eighteen, namely: Sanskrit, Prakrit, Naga, Paisacha, Gandharba,\nRakshasa, Ardhamagadi, Apa, and Guhyaka--most of them being the languages of\ndifferent orders of fabulous beings. He tells us, however, that an account of\nthese dialects may be found in the work called Pingala.\n\n[11] Translated by Sir Wm. Jones, 1789; and by Professor Williams, 1856.\n\n[12] Translated by Professor H. H. Wilson.\n\n[13] The time was propitious to savans. Whilst Vikramaditya lived, Magha,\nanother king, caused to be written a poem called after his name For each verse\nhe is said to have paid to learned men a gold piece, which amounted to a total\nof 5,280l.--a large sum in those days, which preceded those of Paradise Lost.\nAbout the same period Karnata, a third king, was famed for patronizing the\nlearned men who rose to honour at Vikram\'s court. Dhavaka, a poet of nearly\nthe same period, received from King Shriharsha the magnificent present of\n10,000l. for a poem called the Ratna-Mala.\n\n[14] Lieut. Wilford supports the theory that there were eight Vikramadityas,\nthe last of whom established the era. For further particulars, the curious\nreader will consult Lassen\'s Anthologia, and Professor H. H. Wilson\'s Essay on\nVikram (New), As. Red.. ix. 117.\n\n[15] History tells us another tale. The god Indra and the King of Dhara gave\nthe kingdom to Bhartari-hari, another son of Gandhar-ba-Sena, by a handmaiden.\nFor some time, the brothers lived together; but presently they quarrelled.\nVikram being dismissed from court, wandered from place to place in abject\npoverty, and at one time hired himself as a servant to a merchant living in\nGuzerat. At length, Bhartari-hari, disgusted with the world on account of the\ninfidelity of his wife, to whom he was ardently attached, became a religious\ndevotee, and left the kingdom to its fate. In the course of his travels,\nVikram came to Ujjayani, and finding it without a head, assumed the\nsovereignty. He reigned with great splendour, conquering by his arms Utkala,\nVanga, Kuch-bahar, Guzerat, Somnat, Delhi, and other places; until, in his\nturn, he was conquered, and slain by Shalivahan.\n\n[16] The words are found, says Mr. Ward, in the Hindu History compiled by\nMrityungaya.\n\n[17] These duties of kings are thus laid down in the Rajtarangini. It is\nevident, as Professor H. H. Wilson says, that the royal status was by no means\na sinecure. But the rules are evidently the closet work of some pedantic,\ndogmatic Brahman, teaching kingcraft to kings. He directs his instructions,\nnot to subordinate judges, but to the Raja as the chief magistrate, and\nthrough him to all appointed for the administration of his justice.\n\n[18] Lunus, not Luna.\n\n[19] That is to say, "upon an empty stomach."\n\n[20] There are three sandhyas amongst the Hindus--morning, mid-day, and\nsunset; and all three are times for prayer.\n\n[21] The Hindu Cupid.\n\n[22] Patali, the regions beneath the earth.\n\n[23] The Hindu Triad.\n\n[24] Or Avanti, also called Padmavati. It is the first meridian of the Hindus,\nwho found their longitude by observation of lunar eclipses, calculated for it\nand Lanka, or Ceylon. The clepsydra was used for taking time.\n\n[25] In the original only the husband \'\'practiced austere devotion." For the\nbenefit of those amongst whom the "pious wife" is an institution, I have\nextended the privilege.\n\n[26] A Moslem would say, "This is our fate." A Hindu refers at once to\nmetempsychosis, as naturally as a modern Swedenborgian to spiritism.\n\n[27] In Europe, money buys this world, and delivers you from the pains of\npurgatory; amongst the Hindus, it furthermore opens the gate of heaven.\n\n[28] This part of the introduction will remind the reader of the two royal\nbrothers and their false wives in the introduction to the Arabian Nights. The\nfate of Bhartari Raja, however, is historical.\n\n[29] In the original, "Div"--a supernatural being god, or demon. This part of\nthe plot is variously told. According to some, Raja Vikram was surprised, when\nentering the city to see a grand procession at the house of a potter and a boy\nbeing carried off on an elephant to the violent grief of his parents The King\ninquired the reason of their sorrow, and was told that the wicked Div that\nguarded the city was in the habit of eating a citizen per diem. Whereupon the\nvalorous Raja caused the boy to dismount; took his place; entered the palace;\nand, when presented as food for the demon, displayed his pugilistic powers in\na way to excite the monsters admiration.\n\n[30] In India, there is still a monastic order the pleasant duty of whose\nmembers is to enjoy themselves as much as possible. It has been much the same\nin Europe. "Representez-vous le convent de l\'Escurial ou du Mont Cassin, ou\nles cenobites ont toutes sortes de commodities, necessaires, utiles,\ndelectables. superflues, surabondantes, puisqu\'ils ont les cent cinquante\nmille, les quatre cent mille, les cinq cent mille ecus de rente; et jugez si\nmonsieur l\'abbe a de quoi laisser dormir la meridienne a ceux qui voudront."--\nSaint Augustin, de l\'Ouvrage des Moines, by Le Camus, Bishop of Belley, quoted\nby Voltaire, Dict. Phil., sub v. "Apocalypse."\n\n[31] This form of matrimony was recognized by the ancient Hindus, and is\nfrequent in books. It is a kind of Scotch wedding--ultra-Caledonian--taking\nplace by mutual consent, without any form or ceremony. The Gandharbas are\nheavenly minstrels of Indra\'s court, who are supposed to be witnesses.\n\n[32] The Hindu Saturnalia.\n\n[33] The powders are of wheaten flour, mixed with wild ginger-root, sappan-\nwood, and other ingredients. Sometimes the stuff is thrown in syringes.\n\n[34] The Persian proverb is--"Bala e tavilah bar sat i maimun": "The woes of\nthe stable be on the monkey\'s head!" In some Moslem countries a hog acts\nprophylactic. Hence probably Mungo Park\'s troublesome pig at Ludamar.\n\n[35] So the moribund father of the "babes in the wood" lectures his wicked\nbrother, their guardian: "To God and you I recommend My children deare this\nday: But little while, be sure, we have Within this world to stay." But, to\nappeal to the moral sense of a goldsmith!\n\n[36] Maha (great) raja (king): common address even to those who are not royal.\n\n[37] The name means. "Quietistic Disposition."\n\n[38] August. In the solar-lunar year of the Hindu the months are divided into\nfortnights--light and dark.\n\n[39] A flower, whose name frequently occurs in Sanskrit poetry.\n\n[40] The stars being men\'s souls raised to the sky for a time pro portioned to\ntheir virtuous deeds on earth.\n\n[41] A measure of length, each two miles.\n\n[42] The warm region below.\n\n[43] Hindus admire only glossy black hair; the "bonny brown hair" loved by our\nballads is assigned by them to low-caste men, witches, and fiends.\n\n[44] A large kind of bat; a popular and silly Anglo-Indian name. It almost\njustified the irate Scotchman in calling "prodigious leears" those who told\nhim in India that foxes flew and tress were tapped for toddy.\n\n[45] The Hindus, like the European classics and other ancient peoples, reckon\nfour ages:--The Satya Yug, or Golden Age, numbered 1,728,000 years: the\nsecond, or Treta Yug, comprised 1,296,000; the Dwapar Yug had 864,000 and the\npresent, the Kali Yug, has shrunk to 832,000 years.\n\n[46] Especially alluding to prayer. On this point, Southey justly remarks\n(Preface to Curse of Kehama): "In the religion of the Hindoos there is one\nremarkable peculiarity. Prayers, penances, and sacrifices are supposed to\npossess an inherent and actual value, in one degree depending upon the\ndisposition or motive of the person who performs them. They are drafts upon\nheaven for which the gods cannot refuse payment. The worst men, bent upon the\nworst designs, have in this manner obtained power which has made them\nformidable to the supreme deities themselves." Moreover, the Hindu gods hear\nthe prayers of those who desire the evil of others. Hence when a rich man\nbecomes poor, his friends say, "See how sharp are men\'s teeth!" and, "He is\nruined because others could not bear to see his happiness!"\n\n[47] A pond. natural or artificial; in the latter case often covering an\nextent of ten to twelve acres.\n\n[48] The Hindustani "gilahri," or little grey squirrel, whose twittering cry\nis often mistaken for a bird\'s.\n\n[49] The autumn or rather the rainy season personified--a hackneyed Hindu\nprosopopoeia.\n\n[50] Light conversation upon the subject of women is a persona offence to\nserious-minded Hindus.\n\n[51] Cupid in his two forms, Eros and Anteros.\n\n[52] This is true to life in the East, women make the first advances, and men\ndo the begueules.\n\n[53] Raja-hans, a large grey goose, the Hindu equivalent for our swan.\n\n[54] Properly Karnatak; karna in Sanskrit means an ear.\n\n[55] Danta in Sanskrit is a tooth.\n\n[56] Padma means a foot.\n\n[57] A common Hindu phrase equivalent to our " I manage to get on."\n\n[58] Meaning marriage maternity, and so forth.\n\n[59] Yama is Pluto; \'mother of Yama\' is generally applied to an old scold.\n\n[60] Snake-land: the infernal region.\n\n[61] A form of abuse given to Durga, who was the mother of Ganesha (Janus);\nthe latter had an elephant\'s head.\n\n[62] Unexpected pleasure, according to the Hindus, gives a bristly elevation\nto the down of the body.\n\n[63] The Hindus banish " flasks,\'\' et hoc genus omne, from these scenes, and\nperhaps they are right.\n\n[64] The Pankha, or large common fan, is a leaf of the Corypha umbraculifera,\nwith the petiole cut to the length of about five feet, pared round the edges\nand painted to look pretty. It is waved by the servant standing behind a\nchair.\n\n[65] The fabulous mass of precious stones forming the sacred mountain of Hindu\nmythology.\n\n[66] "I love my love with an \'S,\' because he is stupid and not pyschological."\n\n[67] Hindu mythology has also its Cerberus, Trisisa, the " three headed "\nhound that attends dreadful Yama (Pluto)\n\n[68] Parceque c\'est la saison des amours.\n\n[69] The police magistrate, the Catual of Camoens.\n\n[70] The seat of a Hindu ascetic.\n\n[71] The Hindu scriptures.\n\n[72] The Goddess of Prosperity.\n\n[73] In the original the lover is not blamed; this would be the Hindu view of\nthe matter; we might be tempted to think of the old injunction not to seethe a\nkid in the mother\'s milk.\n\n[74] In the original a "maina "-the Gracula religiosa.\n\n[75] As we should say, buried them.\n\n[76] A large kind of black bee, common in India.\n\n[77] The beautiful wife of the demigod Rama Chandra.\n\n[78] The Hindu Ars Amoris.\n\n[79] The old philosophers, believing in a " Sat " (xx xx), postulated an Asat\n(xx xx xx) and made the latter the root of the former.\n\n[80] In Western India, a place celebrated for suicides.\n\n[81] Kama Deva. "Out on thee, foul fiend, talk\'st thou of nothing but ladies?"\n\n[82] The pipal or Ficus religiosa, a favourite roosting-place for fiends.\n\n[83] India.\n\n[84] The ancient name of a priest by profession, meaning " praepositus " or\npraeses. He was the friend and counsellor of a chief, the minister of a king,\nand his companion in peace and war. (M. Muller\'s Ancient Sanskrit Literature,\np. 485).\n\n[85] Lakshmi, the Goddess of Prosperity. Raj-Lakshmi would mean the King\'s\nFortune, which we should call tutelary genius. Lakshichara is our " luckless,"\nforming, as Mr. Ward says, an extraordinary coincidence of sound and meaning\nin languages so different. But the derivations are very distinct.\n\n[86] The Monkey God.\n\n[87] Generally written "Banyan."\n\n[88] The daughter of Raja Janaka, married to Ramachandra. The latter placed\nhis wife under the charge of his brother Lakshmana, and went into the forest\nto worship, when the demon Ravana disguised himself as a beggar, and carried\noff the prize.\n\n[89] This great king was tricked by the god Vishnu out of the sway of heaven\nand earth, but from his exceeding piety he was appointed to reign in Patala,\nor Hades.\n\n[90] The procession is fair game, and is often attacked in the dark with\nsticks and stones, causing serious disputes. At the supper the guests confer\nthe obligation by their presence, and are exceedingly exacting.\n\n[91] Rati is the wife of Kama, the God of Desire; and we explain the word by\n"Spring personified."\n\n[92] The Indian Cuckoo (Cucuius Indicus). It is supposed to lay its eggs in\nthe nest of the crow.\n\n[93] This is the well-known Ghi or Ghee, the one sauce of India which is as\nbadly off in that matter as England.\n\n[94] The European reader will observe that it is her purity which carries the\nheroine through all these perils. Moreover, that her :virtue is its own\nreward, as it loses to her the world.\n\n[95] Literally, "one of all tastes"--a wild or gay man, we should say.\n\n[96] These shoes are generally made of rags and bits of leather; they have\noften toes behind the foot, with other similar contrivances, yet they scarcely\never deceive an experienced man.\n\n[97] The high-toper is a swell-thief, the other is a low dog.\n\n[98] Engaged in shoplifting.\n\n[99] The moon.\n\n[100] The judge.\n\n[101] To be lagged is to be taken; scragging is hanging.\n\n[102] The tongue.\n\n[103] This is the god Kartikeya, a mixture of Mars and Mercury, who revealed\nto a certain Yugacharya the scriptures known as "Chauriya-Vidya"--Anglice,\n"Thieves\' Manual." The classical robbers of the Hindu drama always perform\naccording to its precepts. There is another work respected by thieves and\ncalled the "Chora-Panchashila," because consisting of fifty lines.\n\n[104] Supposed to be a good omen.\n\n[105] Share the booty.\n\n[106] Bhawani is one of the many forms of the destroying goddess, the wife of\nShiva.\n\n[107] Wretches who kill with the narcotic seed of the stramonium.\n\n[108] Better know as "Thugs," which in India means simply "rascals."\n\n[109] Crucifixion, until late years, was common amongst the Buddhists of the\nBurmese empire. According to an eye-witness, Mr. F. Carey, the puishment was\ninflicted in two ways. Sometimes criminals were crucified by their hands and\nfeet being nailed to a scaffold; others were merely tied up, and fed. In these\ncases the legs and feet of the patient began to swell and mortify at the\nexpiration fo three or four days; men are said to have lived in this state for\na fortnight, and at last they expired from fatigue and mortification. The\nsufferings from cramp also must be very severe. In India generally impalement\nwas more common than crucifixion.\n\n[110] Our Suttee. There is an admirable Hindu proverb, which says, "No one\nknows the ways of woman; she kill her husband and becomes a Sati."\n\n[111] Fate and Destiny are rather Moslem than Hindu fancies.\n\n[112] Properly speaking, the husbandman should plough with not fewer than four\nbullocks; but few can afford this. If he plough with a cow or a bullock, and\nnot with a bull, the rice produced by his ground is unclean, and may not be\nused in any religious ceremony.\n\n[113] A shout of triumph, like our "Huzza" or "Hurrah!" of late degraded into\n"Hooray." "Hari bol" is of course religious, meaning "Call upon Hari!" i.e.\nKrishna, i.e. Vishnu.\n\n[114] This form of suicide is one of those recognized in India. So in Europe\nwe read of fanatics who, with a suicidal ingenuity, have succeeded in\ncrucifying themselves.\n\n[115] The river of Jaganath in Orissa; it shares the honours of sanctity with\nsome twenty-nine others, and in the lower regions it represents the classical\nStyx.\n\n[116] Cupid. His wife Rati is the spring personified. The Hindu poets always\nunite love and spring, and perhaps physiologically they are correct.\n\n[117] An incarnation of the third person of the Hindu Triad, or Triumvirate,\nShiva the God of Destruction, the Indian Bacchus. The image has five faces,\nand each face has three eyes. In Bengal it is found in many villages, and the\nwomen warn their children not to touch it on pain of being killed.\n\n[118] A village Brahman on stated occasions receives fees from all the\nvillagers.\n\n[119] The land of Greece.\n\n[120] Savans, professors. So in the old saying, "Hanta, Pandit Sansara "--\nAlas! the world is learned! This a little antedates the well-known\nschoolmaster.\n\n[121] Children are commonly sent to school at the age of five. Girls are not\ntaught to read, under the common idea that they will become widows if they do.\n\n[122] Meaning the place of reading the four Shastras.\n\n[123] A certain goddess who plays tricks with mankind. If a son when grown up\nact differently from what his parents did, people say that he has been changed\nin the womb.\n\n[124] Shani is the planet Saturn, which has an exceedingly baleful influence\nin India as elsewhere.\n\n[125] The Eleatic or Materialistic school of Hindu philosophy, which agrees to\nexplode an intelligent soparate First Cause.\n\n[126] The writings of this school give an excellent view of the "progressive\nsystem," which has popularly been asserted to be a modern idea. But Hindu\nphilosophy seems to have exhausted every fancy that can spring from the brain\nof man.\n\n[127] Tama is the natural state of matter, Raja is passion acting upon nature,\nand Satwa is excellence These are the three gunas or qualities of matter.\n\n[128] Spiritual preceptors and learned men.\n\n[129] Under certain limitations, gambling is allowed hy Hindu law and the\nwinner has power over the person and property of the loser. No "debts of\nhonour" in Hindustan!\n\n[130] Quotations from standard works on Hindu criminal law, which in some\npoints at least is almost as absurd as our civilized codes.\n\n[131] Hindus carry their money tied up in a kind of sheet. which is wound\nround the waist and thrown over the shoulder.\n\n[132] A thieves\' manual in the Sanskrit tongue; it aspires to the dignity of a\n"Scripture."\n\n[133] All sounds, say the Hindus, are of similar origin, and they do not die;\nif they did, they could not be remembered.\n\n[134] Gold pieces.\n\n[135] These are the qualifications specified by Hindu classical authorities as\nnecessary to make a distinguished thief.\n\n[136] Every Hindu is in a manner born to a certain line of life, virtuous or\nvicious, honest or dishonest and his Dharma, or religious duty, consists in\nconforming to the practice and the worship of his profession. The "Thug," for\ninstance, worships Bhawani, who enables him to murder successfully; and his\nremorse would arise from neglecting to murder.\n\n[137] Hindu law sensibly punishes, in theory at least, for the same offence\nthe priest more severely than the layman--a hint for him to practice what he\npreaches.\n\n[138] The Hindu Mercury, god of rascals.\n\n[139] A penal offence in India. How is it that we English have omitted to\ncodify it? The laws of Manu also punish severely all disdainful expressions,\nsuch as "tush" or "pish," addressed during argument to a priest.\n\n[140] Stanzas, generally speaking, on serious subjects.\n\n[141] Whitlows on the nails show that the sufferer, in the last life, stole\ngold from a Brahman.\n\n[142] A low caste Hindu, who catches and exhibits snakes and performs other\nsuch mean offices.\n\n[143] Meaning, in spite of themselves.\n\n[144] When the moon is in a certain lunar mansion, at the conclusion of the\nwet season.\n\n[145] In Hindustan, it is the prevailing wind of the hot weather.\n\n[146] Vishnu, as a dwarf, sank down into and secured in the lower regions the\nRaja Bali, who by his piety and prayerfulness was subverting the reign of the\nlesser gods; as Ramachandra he built a bridge between Lanka (Ceylon) and the\nmain land; and as Krishna he defended, by holding up a hill as an umbrella for\nthem, his friends the shepherds and shepherdesses from the thunders of Indra,\nwhose worship they had neglected.\n\n[147] The priestly caste sprang, as has been said, from the noblest part of\nthe Demiurgus; the three others from lower members.\n\n[148] A chew of betel leaf and spices is offered by the master of the house\nwhen dismissing a visitor.\n\n[149] Respectable Hindus say that receiving a fee for a daughter is like\nselling flesh.\n\n[150] A modern custom amongst the low caste is for the bride and bridegroom,\nin the presence of friends, to place a flower garland on each other\'s necks,\nand thus declare themselves man and wife. The old classical Gandharva-lagan\nhas been before explained.\n\n[151] Meaning that the sight of each other will cause a smile, and that what\none purposes the other will consent to.\n\n[152] This would be the verdict of a Hindu jury.\n\n[153] Because stained with the powder of Mhendi, or the Lawsonia inermis\nshrub.\n\n[154] Kansa\'s son: so called because the god Shiva, when struck by his shafts,\ndestroyed him with a fiery glance.\n\n[155] "Great Brahman"; used contemptuously to priests who officiate for\nservile men. Brahmans lose their honour by the following things: By becoming\nservants to the king; by pursuing any secular business; by acting priests to\nShudras (serviles); by officiating as priests for a whole village; and by\nneglecting any part of the three daily services. Many violate these rules; yet\nto kill a Brahman is still one of the five great Hindu sins. In the present\nage of the world, the Brahman may not accept a gift of cows or of gold; of\ncourse he despises the law. As regards monkey worship, a certain Rajah of\nNadiya is said to have expended \xc2\x9c10,000 in marrying two monkeys with all the\nparade and splendour of the Hindu rite.\n\n[156] The celebrated Gayatri, the Moslem Kalmah.\n\n[157] Kama again.\n\n[158] From "Man," to think; primarily meaning, what makes man think.\n\n[159] The Cirrhadae of classical writers.\n\n[160] The Hindu Pluto; also called the Just King.\n\n[161] Yama judges the dead. whose souls go to him in four hours and forty\nminutes; therefore a corpse cannot be burned till after that time. His\nresidence is Yamalaya. and it is on the south side of the earth; down South,\nas we say. (I, Sam. xxv. 1, and xxx. 15). The Hebrews, like the Hindus, held\nthe northern parts of the world to be higher than the southern. Hindus often\njoke a man who is seen walking in that direction, and ask him where he is\ngoing.\n\n[162] The "Ganges," in heaven called Mandakini. I have no idea why we still\nadhere to our venerable corruption of the word.\n\n[163] The fabulous mountain supposed by Hindu geographers to occupy the centre\nof the universe.\n\n[164] The all-bestowing tree in Indra\'s Paradise which grants everything asked\nof it. It is the Tuba of Al-Islam and is not unknown to the Apocryphal New\nTestament.\n\n[165] "Vikramaditya, Lord of the Saka." This is prevoyance on the part of the\nVampire; the king had not acquired the title.\n\n[166] On the sixth day after the child\'s birth, the god Vidhata writes all its\nfate upon its forehead. The Moslems have a similar idea, and probably it\npassed to the Hindus.\n\n[167] Goddess of eloquence. "The waters of the Saraswati " is the classical\nHindu phrase for the mirage.\n\n[168] This story is perhaps the least interesting in the collection. I have\ntranslated it literally, in order to give an idea of the original. The reader\nwill remark in it the source of our own nursery tale about the princess who\nwas so high born and delicately bred, that she could discover the three peas\nlaid beneath a straw mattress and four feather beds. The Hindus, however,\nbelieve that Sybaritism can be carried so far; I remember my Pandit asserting\nthe truth of the story.\n\n[169] A minister. The word, as is the case with many in this collection, is\nquite modern Moslem, and anachronistic.\n\n[170] The cow is called the mother of the gods, and is declared by Brahma, the\nfirst person of the triad, Vishnu and Shiva being the second and the third, to\nbe a proper object of worship. "If a European speak to the Hindu about eating\nthe flesh of cows," says an old missionary, "they immediately raise their\nhands to their ears; yet milkmen, carmen, and farmers beat the cow as\nunmercifully as a carrier of coals beats his ass in England."The Jains or\nJainas (from ji, to conquer; as subduing the passions) are one of the\natheistical sects with whom the Brahmans have of old carried on the fiercest\nreligious controversies, ending in many a sanguinary fight. Their tenets are\nconsequently exaggerated and ridiculed, as in the text. They believe that\nthere is no such God as the common notions on the subject point out, and they\nhold that the highest act of virtue is to abstain from injuring sentient\ncreatures. Man does not possess an immortal spirit: death is the same to\nBrahma and to a fly. Therefore there is no heaven or hell separate from\npresent pleasure or pain. Hindu Epicureans!--"Epicuri de grege porci."\n\n[171] Narak is one of the multitudinous places of Hindu punishment, said to\nadjoin the residence of Ajarna. The less cultivated Jains believe in a region\nof torment. The illuminati, however, have a sovereign contempt for the\nCreator, for a future state, and for all religious ceremonies. As Hindus,\nhowever, they believe in future births of mankind, somewhat influenced by\npresent actions. The "next birth" in the mouth of a Hindu, we are told, is the\nsame as "to-morrow" in the mouth of a Christian. The metempsychosis is on an\nextensive scale: according to some, a person who loses human birth must pass\nthrough eight millions of successive incarnations\xc3\x84fish, insects, worms, birds,\nand beasts\xc3\x84before he can reappear as a man.\n\n[172] Jogi, or Yogi, properly applies to followers of the Yoga or Patanjala\nschool, who by ascetic practices acquire power over the elements. Vulgarly, it\nis a general term for mountebank vagrants, worshippers of Shiva. The Janganis\nadore the same deity, and carry about a Linga. The Sevras are Jain beggars,\nwho regard their chiefs as superior to the gods of other sects. The Sannyasis\nare mendicant followers of Shiva; they never touch metals or fire, and. in\nreligious parlance, they take up the staff They are opposed to the Viragis,\nworshippers of Vishnu, who contend as strongly against the worshippers of gods\nwho receive bloody offerings. as a Christian could do against idolatry.\n\n[173] The Brahman, or priest, is supposed to proceed from the mouth of Brahma,\nthe creating person of the Triad; the Khshatriyas (soldiers) from his arms;\nthe Vaishyas (enterers into business) from his thighs; and the Shudras, "who\ntake refuge in the Brahmans," from his feet.
