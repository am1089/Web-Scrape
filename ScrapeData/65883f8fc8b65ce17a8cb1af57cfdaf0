Pariksit said :-- When the Muni Ruru went to his room to sleep, his mind\nhaving become perturbed with passion, his father Pramati seeing him sorrowful,\nasked him :-- \xc2\x93O Ruru! Why do you look so\n\n\n\n\n\nabsent minded?\xc2\x94 Ruru was passionate then; so he said to his father :-- \xc2\x93I saw\na girl named Pramadvara in the hermitage of Sthulakes'a; I wish that she might\nbecome my wife.\xc2\x94 Hearing this, Pramati went immediately to the hermitage of\nSthulakes'a, and pleased him by various conversations and asked for her\nbeautiful daughter when Sthulakes'a promised that he would give her daughter\nin marriage on an auspicious day. Then both the high-souled persons Pramati\nand Sthulakes'a began to work in co-operation and make arrangements for\nmarriage ceremony and collected various articles in that hermitage when the\nfair eyed girl Pramadvara, while playing in the courtyard in the house, trod\non a serpent and was bitten by it and consequently died. Seeing then\nPramadvara dead, all the Munis of the place assembled and cried and wept with\nsorrowful hearts, when a great tumultuous uproar ensued. Though the life\ndeparted from Pramadvara\xc2\x92s body, yet seeing the brilliant lustre of her\nlifeless body lying on the ground, her nourisher and father Sthulakes'a became\nvery sorry and wept aloud. Hearing this cry of his, Ruru came there to see\nwhat had happened and perceived the girl, though lifeless, yet seeming alive\nand lying on the ground.\n\n\n\nSeeing Sthulakes'a and other Risis weeping, Ruru went out from that place and\nwith a grievous heart, began to cry aloud. \xc2\x93Alas! Fate has certainly sent this\nserpent as the cause of all my miseries and to mar all my happiness. Alas!\nWhat am I to do now? Where to go? When my beloved has fallen unto the jaws of\ndeath, I do not want to live any longer, bereft of my wife. Oh! What an\nunfortunate creature I am? I have not been able to embrace this beautiful\ndarling of mine. I am deprived of kissing her face and marrying her. Alas! Fie\nto my human birth! Let my life get out just now in as much as I could not, out\nof mere shame, throw myself on the burning pyre along with my beloved! Oh!\nWhen death comes not to the sorrowful person, even when prayed for, how then\ncan I expect divine happiness in this world? So let me now drop myself down in\na lake or enter in to a burning fire or drink venom or strangle myself by\ntieing rope round my neck!\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n18-31. Thus Ruru wailed much on the bank of the river and long reflecting in\nhis mind found out a way and thought what would be the advantage in death?\n\xc2\x93Rather an irretrievable sin would be incurred in committing suicide; and my\nfather and mother would be sorry. Seeing me commit suicide, my bad luck and\nenemies will be gladdened; there is no manner of doubt; in this. What benefit\nwill my beloved gain if I commit suicide or if I be distressed for her\nbereavement. Suppose\n\n\n\np. 106\n\n\n\nI die, even then my beloved will not become mine in the next world; so there\nare many faults in my committing suicide but there is no fault if I preserve\nmy life.\xc2\x94 Thus coming to a conclusion Ruru bathed, performed \xc3\x82chaman and\nbecame pure. He then took water in his hand and said :-- \xc2\x93Whatever good works,\nworshipping the gods, etc., that I have done and if I have performed, with\ndevotion, the service to my preceptors and teachers and superiors, homa\nceremonies, Japam, tapasya, if I have studied all the Vedas and if I have\nrecited Gayatri and worshipped the Sun then let my beloved have life and get\nup as an outcome of my Pu _n_ yam. If my beloved does not get back her life, I\nwill certainly quit my life.\xc2\x94 Thus saying, he worshipped the Devas mentally\nand threw that water of his hands on the ground. Thus Ruru, with a sorrowful\nheart, was weeping. The Deva's messenger came down and said :-- \xc2\x93O Brahma _n_!\nDon't make this bold attempt; how can your beloved get back her life? The\nlife-period of this beautiful girl, born of Gandharva's sperm and Apsara's\novum is now exhausted; now look for another beautiful woman. O one of very\ndull understanding! Why are you crying in vain? Where is the affection between\nyou and this girl; she died in an unmarried state (without marrying you).\xc2\x94 At\nthis Ruru said :-- \xc2\x93O Deva messenger! I won't marry any other lady, whether my\nbeloved gets back her life or does not get back her life; in case she does not\nregain this life, I will also forego my life at this instant.\xc2\x94 At this\ngreatest importunity of Ruru, the Deva messenger became glad and spoke the\nfollowing truthful beneficent yet beautiful words :--\n\n\n\n32-51. \xc2\x93O Brahma _n_ a! I will suggest one way to you; kindly hear. The Devas\nordained this long, long ago. You can give up your half life period, and with\nthat you can make this girl alive soon.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nRuru said :-- \xc2\x93O Deva messenger! I give half my life-period to this girl;\nthere is no doubt in this. Let my beloved get back her life soon and get up.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nThe king said :-- O Ministers! At this time Visvavasu, knowing that his\ndaughter Pramadvara is dead, descended from the Heavens in a celestial car and\ncame to the place; then the Gandharva king and the Deva messenger both went to\nYama, the Dharmaraj, and spoke thus :-- \xc2\x93O Dharmaraj! This Visvavasu's\ndaughter Pramadvara, the wife of Ruru, the Ri _s_ is' son was bitten by a\nsnake and has now come to your place. The Dvija Ruru is now desirous to quit\nhis life; so, O Sun's son! Now let the girl again get her life through the\ninfluence of Ruru's brahmacharya (purity) as a consequence of his giving away\nhalf his life period for the girl.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\np. 107\n\n\n\nDharma said :-- \xc2\x93O Deva messenger! if you want to make the girl alive again,\nlet her get life as a consequence of half the life-period of Ruru being\nsubtracted. Go immediately and give the girl to Ruru.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nThe king said :-- \xc2\x93O Ministers! Yama having said thus to the Deva messenger,\nhe went away immediately and made Pramadvara alive and handed her over to\nRuru.\n\n\n\nThus, on an auspicious day, Ruru married her. Thus the Ri _s_ is' daughter\nPramadvara though fallen dead, got again her life by proper means. So, O\nCouncillors! to save life, one should resort one's best duty according to the\nS\xc2\x92astras, by the use of gems, mantras, and herbs and plants.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nThus speaking to the ministers, the king Pariksit had a fine building of seven\nfloors in height erected, placed the principal guards around it and stationed\nalso the most powerful men well versed in the knowledge of mani (gems),\nmantrams, and plants for protection and immediately ascended to this building.\nTo appease the wrath of the Muni S\xc2\x92ringi, the king sent the Muni named\nGaurmukha to him and requested him repeatedly \xc2\x93Let the crime of the humble\ndevotee be forgiven.\xc2\x94 Then, for self preservation, the king brought from all\nsides the Brahma _n_ as, who are perfect in their knowledge and application of\nthe mantras. The minister's son placed the elephants in proper places so that\nno body can ascend to the top of the building; what more can be said than the\nfact that even air could not find entrance there when once ordered \xc2\x93no\nadmission\xc2\x94 what to speak of others! The king Pariksit remained there and\ncounted the number of days of the serpent Tak _s_ aka's coming there; he\nperformed his bath, Sandhya Bandanams and fooding; even he consulted with his\nministers and governed his kingdom from there. O Ri _s_ is! At this time a\nBrahma _n_ named Kas'yapa, versed in the mantras, heard of the curse of the\nking and thought that he would get abundant wealth if he could free the king\nfrom Tak _s_ aka's poison and proposed to himself that he would go to the\nplace where the cursed king Pariksit was staying with the Brahma _n_ as.\nPondering thus, the Brahma _n_ a went out of his house, on the expectation of\nwealth from the king.\n\n\n\nThus ends the ninth chapter of the second Skandha on the account of Ruru in\nthe Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 10](bk02ch10.htm)\n\n"
