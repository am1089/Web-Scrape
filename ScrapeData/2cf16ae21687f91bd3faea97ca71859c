If it be said that on account of being denoted as that which is not (the\neffect does) not (exist before it is actually produced); (we reply) not so,\n(because\n\np. 333\n\nthe term 'that which is not' denotes) another quality (merely); (as appears)\nfrom the complementary sentence.\n\nBut, an objection will be raised, in some places Scripture speaks of the\neffect before its production as that which is not; so, for instance, 'In the\nbeginning this was that only which is not' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 19, 1); and 'Non-\nexistent 1 indeed this was in the beginning' (Taitt. Up. II, 7). Hence Being\n(sattvam) cannot be ascribed to the effect before its production.\n\nThis we deny. For by the Non-existence of the effect previous to its\nproduction is not meant absolute Non-existence, but only a different quality\nor state, viz. the state of name and form being unevolved, which state is\ndifferent from the state of name and form being evolved. With reference to the\nlatter state the effect is called, previous to its production, non-existent\nalthough then also it existed identical with its cause. We conclude this from\nthe complementary passage, according to the rule that the sense of a passage\nwhose earlier part is of doubtful meaning is determined by its complementary\npart. With reference to the passage. 'In the beginning this was non-existent\nonly,' we remark that what is there denoted by the word 'Non-existing' is--in\nthe complementary passage, 'That became existent'--referred to by the word\n'that,' and qualified as 'Existent.'\n\nThe word 'was' would, moreover, not apply to the (absolutely) Non-existing,\nwhich cannot be conceived as connected with prior or posterior time.--Hence\nwith reference to the other passage also, 'Non-existing indeed,' &c., the\ncomplementary part, 'That made itself its Self,' shows, by the qualification\nwhich it contains, that absolute Non-existence is not meant.--It follows from\nall this that the designation of 'Non-existence' applied to the effect before\nits production has reference to a different state of being merely. And as\nthose things which are distinguished\n\np. 334\n\nby name and form are in ordinary language called 'existent,' the term 'non-\nexistent' is figuratively applied to them to denote the state in which they\nwere previously to their differentiation.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[333:1](sbe34156.htm#fr_296) For simplicity's sake, asat will be translated\nhenceforth by non-existing.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1, 18](sbe34157.htm)\n\n"
