Bravest of the brave,  \nInvincible, of furious might,  \nNe'er had they turned their backs in flight.  \nThey, as their leader bade them seize  \nSpears, swords, and clubs, and rocks, and trees.  \n\nPoured on the dauntless prince again  \nA ceaseless shower of deadly rain.  \nThe virtuous Rama, undismayed.  \nTheir missiles with his arrows stayed,  \nAnd weakened, ere it fell, the shock  \nOf that dire hail of tree and rock,  \nAnd like a bull with eyelids closed,  \nThe pelting of the storm opposed.  \n\nThen blazed his ire: he longed to smite  \nTo earth the rovers of the night.  \nThe wrath that o'er his spirit came  \nClothed him with splendour as of flame,  \nWhile showers of mortal darts he poured  \nFierce on the giants and their lord.  \nDushan, the foeman's dusky dread,  \nBy frenzied rage inspirited,  \nOn Raghu's son his missiles cast  \nLike Indra's bolts which rend and blast.  \nBut Rama with a trenchant dart  \nCleft Dushan's ponderous bow apart.  \nAnd then the gold-decked steeds who drew  \nThe chariot, with four shafts he slew.  \nOne crescent dart he aimed which shred  \nClean from his neck the driver's head;  \nThree more with deadly skill addressed  \nStood quivering in the giant's breast.  \nHurled from his car, steeds, driver slain,  \nThe bow he trusted cleft in twain,  \nHe seized his mace, strong, heavy, dread,  \nHigh as a mountain's towering head.  \nWith plates of gold adorned and bound,  \nEmbattled Gods it crushed and ground.  \nIts iron spikes yet bore the stains  \nOf mangled foemen's blood and brains.  \nIts heavy mass of jagged steel  \nWas like a thunderbolt to feel,  \nIt shattered, as on foes it fell,  \nThe city where the senses dwell. 1b  \nFierce Dushan seized that ponderous mace  \nLike monstrous form of serpent race,  \nAnd all his savage soul aglow  \nWith fury, rushed upon the foe.  \nBut Raghu's son took steady aim,  \nAnd as the rushing giant came,  \nShore with two shafts the arms whereon  \nThe demon's glittering bracelets shone.  \nHis arm at each huge shoulder lopped,  \nThe mighty body reeled and dropped.  \nAnd the great mace to earth was thrown  \nLike Indra's staff when storms have blown,  \nAs some vast elephant who lies  \nShorn of his tusks, and bleeding dies,  \nSo, when his arms were rent away,  \nLow on the ground the giant lay.  \nThe spirits saw the monster die,  \nAnd loudly rang their joyful cry,  \n'Honour to Rama! nobly done!  \nWell hast thou fought, Kakutstha's son!  \n\np. 260  \n\n   But the great three, the host who led,  \nEnraged to see their chieftain dead,  \nAs though Death's toils were round them cast,  \nRushed upon Rama fierce and fast,  \nMahakapala seized, to strike  \nHis foeman down, a ponderous pike:  \nSthulaksha charged with spear to fling,  \nPramathi with his axe to swing.  \nWhen Rama saw, with keen darts he  \nReceived the onset of the three,  \nAs calm as though he hailed a guest  \nIn each, who came for shade and rest.  \nMahakapala's monstrous head  \nFell with the trenchant dart he sped.  \nHis good right hand in battle skilled  \nSthulaksha's eyes with arrows tilled,  \nAnd trusting still his ready bow  \nHe laid the fierce Pramathi low,  \nWho sank as some tall tree falls down  \nWith bough and branch and leafy crown.  \nThen with five thousand shafts he slew  \nThe rest of Dushan's giant crew:  \nFive thousand demons, torn and rent,  \nTo Yama's gloomy realm he sent.  \n   When Khara knew the fate of all  \nThe giant band and Dushan's fall,  \nHe called the mighty chiefs who led  \nHis army, and in fury said:  \n   'Now Dushan and his armed train  \nLie prostrate on the battle plain.  \nLead forth an army mightier still,  \nRama this wretched man, to kill.  \nFight ye with darts of every shape,  \nNor let him from your wrath escape.'  \n   Thus spoke the fiend, by rage impelled,  \nAnd straight his course toward Rama held.  \nWith S'yenagami and the rest  \nOf his twelve chiefs he onward pressed,  \nAnd every giant as he went  \nA storm of well-wrought arrows sent.  \nThen with his pointed shafts that came  \nWith gold and diamond bright as flame,  \nDead to the earth tht hero threw  \nThe remnant of the demon crew.  \nThose shafts with feathers bright as gold,  \nLike flames which wreaths of smoke enfold,  \nSmote down the fiends like tall trees rent  \nBy red bolts from the firmament.  \nA hundred shafts be pointed well:  \nBy their keen barbs a hundred fell:  \nA thousand,--and a thousand more  \nIn battle's front lay drenched in gore.  \nOf all defence and guard bereft,  \nWith sundered bows and harness cleft.  \nTheir bodies red with bloody stain  \nFell the night-rovers on the plain,  \nWhich, covered with the loosened hair  \nOf bleeding giants prostrate there,  \nLike some great altar showed, arrayed  \nFor holy rites with grass o'erlaid.  \nThe darksome wood, each glade and dell  \nWhere the wild demons fought and fell  \nWas like an awful hell whose floor  \nIs thick with mire and flesh and gore.  \n   Thus twice seven thousand fiends, a band  \nWith impious heart and bloody hand,  \nBy Raghu's son were overthrown,  \nA man, on foot, and all alone.  \nOf all who met on that fierce day,  \nKhara, great chief, survived the fray,  \nThe monster of the triple head, [1](ry225.htm#fn_471)  \nAnd Raghu's son, the foeman'a dread.  \nThe other demon warriors, all  \nSkilful and brave and strong and tall,  \nIn front of battle, side by side,  \nStruck down by Lakshman's brother died.  \n   When Khara saw the host he led  \n     Triumphant forth to fight  \n   Stretched on the earth, all smitten dead,  \n     By Rama's nobler might,  \n   Upon his foe he fiercely glared,  \n     And drove against him fast,  \n   Like Indra when his arm is bared  \n     His thundering bolt to cast.  \n\n        * * * * *  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[259:1](ry223.htm#fr_469) One of the mysterious weapons given to Rama.\n\n[259:1b](ry224.htm#fr_470) A periphrasis for the body.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXVII.: The Death of Tris'iras.](ry225.htm)\n\n"
