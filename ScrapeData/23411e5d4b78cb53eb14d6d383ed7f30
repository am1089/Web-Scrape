The preparation of the brahmaudana, the porridge given as a fee to\nthe Brahmans.\n\n1\\. (Thyself) a male, step thou upon the hide of the male (steer): go, call\nthither all that is dear to thee! At whatever age ye two formerly did first\nunite (in marriage), may that age be your common lot in Yama's kingdom!  \n2\\. Your sight shall be as clear (as formerly), your strength as abundant,\nyour lustre as great, your vitality as manifold! When Agni, the (funeral-)\npyre, fastens himself upon the corpse, then as a pair ye.shall rise from the\n(cooked) porridge!  \n3\\. Come ye together in this world, upon the road to the gods, and in Yama's\nrealms! By purifications purified call ye together the offspring that has\nsprung from you!  \n4\\. Around the water united, sit ye down, O children; around this living\n(father) and the waters that refresh the living! Partake of these (waters),\nand of that porridge which the mother of you two cooks, and which is called\namrita (ambrosia)!  \n5\\. The porridge which the father of you two, and which the mother cooks, unto\nfreedom from defilement and foulness of speech, that porridge with a hundred\nstreams (of ghee), leading to heaven, has penetrated with might both the\nhemispheres of the world.  \n6\\. In that one of the two hemispheres and the two heavenly worlds, conquered\nby the pious, which especially abounds in light, and is rich in honey, in that\ndo ye in the fulness of time come together with your children!  \n7\\. Keep ever on in an easterly direction: this is the region that the\nfaithful cling to! When your cooked porridge has been prepared on the fire,\nhold together, O man and wife, that ye may guard it!  \n8\\. When ye shall have reached the southerly direction, turn ye to this\nvessel! In that Yama, associated with the fathers, shall give abundant\nprotection to your cooked porridge!  \n9\\. This westerly direction is especially favoured: in it Soma is ruler and\nconsoler. To this hold, attach yourselves to the pious: then as a pair ye\nshall rise from the cooked porridge!  \n10\\. The northerly direction shall make our realm the very uppermost, in\noffspring, uppermost! The purusha is the metre pahkti: with all (our kin),\nendowed with all their limbs, may we be united!  \n11\\. This 'firm' direction (nadir) is Virag (brilliancy): reverence be to her;\nmay she be kind to my children and to me! Mayest thou, O goddess Aditi, who\nboldest all treasures, as an alert guardian guard the cooked porridge!  \n12\\. As a father his children do thou, (O earth), embrace us; may gentle winds\nblow upon us here on earth! Then the porridge which the two divinities (the\nsacrificer and his wife) are here preparing for us shall take note of our\nreligious fer~our and our truth!  \n13\\. Whatever the black bird, that has come hither stealthily, has touched of\nthat ahich has stuck to the rim, or whatever the wet-banded slavegirl does\npollute-may ye, O waters, purify (that) mortar and pestle!  \n14\\. May this sturdy press-stone, with broad bottom, purified by the\npurifiers, beat away the Rakshas! Settle upon the skin, afford firm\nprotection; may man and wife not come to grief in their children!  \n15\\. The (pestle of) wood has come to us together with the gods: it drives\naway the Rakshas and Pisakas. Up it shall rise, shall let its voice resound  \nthrough it let us conquer all the worlds!  \n16\\. The cattle clothed itself in sevenfold strength, those among them that\nare sleek and those that are poor. The thirty-three gods attend them mayest\nthou, (O cattle), guide us to the heavenly world!  \n17\\. To the bright world of heaven thou shalt lead us; (there) let us be\nunited with wife and children! I take her hand, may she follow me there;\nneither Nirriti (destruction), nor Arati (grudge), shall gain mastery over us!  \n18\\. May we get past the evil Grahi (seizure)! Casting aside darkness do thou,\n(O pestle), let thy lovely voice resound; do not, O wooden tool, when raised,\ndo injury; do not mutilate the grain devoted to the gods!  \n19\\. All-embracing, about to be covered with ghee, enter, (O pot), as a co-\ndweller this space!--Take hold of the winnowing-basket, that has been grown by\nthe rain: the spelt and the chaff it shall sift out!  \n20\\. Three regions are constructed after the pattern of the Brahmana: yonder\nheaven, the earth, and the atmosphere.--Take the (soma-) shoots, and hold one\nanother, (O man and wife)! They (the shoots) shall swell (with moisture), and\nagain go back into the winnowing-basket!  \n21\\. Of manifold variegated colours are the animals, one colour hast thou, (O\nporridge), when successfully prepared.--Push these (soma-) Shoots upon this\nred skin; the press-stone shall purify them as the washer-man his clothes!  \n22\\. Thee, the (pot of) earth, I place upon the earth: your substance is the\nsame, though thine, (O pot), is modified. Even though a blow has cracked or\nscratched thee, do not therefore burst: with this verse do I cover that up!  \n23\\. Gently as a mother embrace the son: I unite thee, (pot of) earth, with\nthe earth! Mayest thou, the hollow pot, not totter upon the altar, when thou\nart pressed by the tools of sacrifice and the ghee!  \n24\\. May Agni who cooks thee protect thee on the east, Indra with the Maruts\nprotect thee on the south! May Varuna on the west support thee upon thy\nfoundation, may Soma on the north hold thee together!  \n25\\. Purified by the purifiers, the (waters) flow pure from the clouds, they\nreach to the spaces of heaven, and of the earth. They are alive, refresh the\nlivino, and are firmly rooted: may Agni heat them, after they have been poured\ninto the vessel!  \n26\\. From heaven they come, into the earth they penetrate; from the earth they\npenetrate into the atmosphere. May they, now pure, yet purify themselves\nfurther; may they conduct us to the heavenly world!  \n27\\. Whether ye are over-abundant or just sufficient, ye are surely clear,\npure, and immortal: cook, ye waters, instructed by the husband and wife,\nobliging and helpful, the porridge!  \n28\\. Counted drops penetrate into the earth, commensurate with the breaths of\nlife and the plants. The uncounted golden (drops), that are poured into (the\nporridge), have, (themselves) pure, established complete purity.  \n29\\. The boiling waters rise and sputter, cast up foam and many bubbles.\nUnite, ye waters, with this grain, as a woman who beholds her husband in the\nproper season!  \n30\\. Stir up (the grains) as they settle at the bottom: let them mingle their\ninmost parts with the waters! The water here I have measured with cups;\nmeasured was the grain, so as to be according to these regulations.  \n31\\. Hand over the sickle, with haste bring promptly (the grass for the\nbarhis); without giving pain let them cut the plants at the joints! They whose\nkingdom Soma rules, the plants, shall not harbour anger against us!  \n32\\. Strew a new barhis for the porridge: pleasing to its heart, and lovely to\nits sight it shall be! Upon it the gods together with the goddesses shall\nenter; settle down to this (porridge) in proper order, and eat it!  \n33\\. O (instrument of) wood, settle down upon the strewn barhis, in keeping\nwith the divinities and the agnishloma rites! Well shaped, as if by a\ncarpenter (Tvashtar) with his axe, is thy form. Longing for this (porridge)\nthe (gods) shall be seen about the vessel!  \n34\\. In sixty autumns the treasurer (of the porridge) shall fetch it, by the\ncooked grain he shall obtain heaven; the parents and the children shall live\nupon it. Bring thou this (man) to heaven, into the presence of Agni!  \n35\\. (Thyself) a holder, (O pot), hold on to the foundation of the earth:\nthee, that art immoveable the gods (alone) shall move! Man and wife, alive,\nwith living children, shall remove thee from the hearth of the fire!  \n36\\. Thou hast conquered and reached all worlds; as many as are our wishes,\nthou hast satisfied them. Dip ye in, stirring stick and spoon! Place it (the\npor idge) upon a single dish!  \n37\\. Lay (ghee) upon it, let it spread forth, anoint this dish with ghee! As\nthe lowing cow her young that craves the breast, ye gods shall greet with\nsounds of satisfaction this (porridge)!  \n38\\. With ghee thou hast covered it, hast made this place (for the porridge):\nmay it, peerless, spread afar to heaven! Upon it shall rest the mighty eagle;\ngods shall offer it to the divinities!  \n39\\. Whatever the wife cooks aside from thee, (O husband), or the husband\n(cooks) unbeknown of thee, O wife, mix that together: to both of you it shall\nbelong; bring it together into a single place!  \n40\\. As many of her children as dwell upon the earth, and the sons that have\nbeen begotten by him, all those ye shall call up to the dish: on shall come\nthe young knowing their nest!  \n41\\. The goodly streams, swelling with honey, mixed with ghee, the seats of\nambrosia, all these does he obtain, ascends to heaven. In sixty autumns the\ntreasurer (of the porridge) shall fetch it!  \n42\\. The treasurer shall fetch this treasure: all outsiders round about shall\nnot control it! The heaven-directed porridge, that has been presented and\ndeposited by us, in three divisions has reached the thrte heavens.  \n43\\. May Agni burn the ungodly Rakshas; the flesh-devouring Pisaka shall have\nnothing here to partake of! We drive him away, hold him afar from us: the\n\xc3\x82dityas and Angiras shall stay near it!  \n44\\. To the \xc3\x82dityas and the Angiras do I offer this (food of) honey, mixed\nwith ghee. Do ye two, (man and wife), with clean hands, without having injured\na Brahmana, performing pious deeds, go to that heavenly world!  \n45\\. I would obtain this highest part of it (the porridge), the place from\nwhich the highest lord permeates (the all). Pour butter upon it, anoint it\nwitb plentiful ghee: this here is our share, fit for the Angiras!  \n46\\. For the sake of truth and holy strength do we make over this porridge as\na hoarded treasure to the gods: it shall not be lost to us in gaming or in the\nassembly; do not let it go to any other person before me!  \n47\\. I cook, and I give (to the Brahmans), and so, too, my wife, at my\nreligious rite and practice.--With the birth of a son the world of children\nhas arisen (for you): do ye two hold on to a life that extends beyond (your\nyears)!  \n48\\. In that place exists no guilt, and no duplicity, not even if he goes\nconspiring with his friends. This full dish of ours has here been deposited:\nthe cooked (porridge) shall come back again to him that cooks it!  \n49\\. kind deeds we shall perform for our friends: all that hate us shall go to\ndarkness (hell)!--As (fruitful) cow, and (strong) steer, they (man and wife)\nshall during, every successive period of their lives drive away man-besetting\ndeath!  \n50\\. The fires (all) know one another, that which lives in plants, and lives\nin the waters, and all the (light-) gods that glow upon the heaven. The gold\n(here) becomes the light of him that cooks (the porridge).  \n51\\. This (naked skin) among the hides is born upon man (alone), all other\nanimals are riot naked. Clothe yourselves, (ye Brahmans), in sheltering\ngarments: (even) the face of the porridge is a homespun garment!  \n52\\. What falsehood thou shalt speak at play and in the assembly, or the\nfalsehood that thou shalt speak through lust for gain--put on together, (O man\nand wife), this same garment, deposit upon it every blemish!  \n53\\. Produce rain, go to the gods, let smoke arise from (thy) surface; all-\nembracing, about to be covered with ghee, enter as a co-dweller this place!  \n54\\. In many ways heaven assumes within itself a different form, according to\ncircumstances. It (the heaven) has laid aside its black form, purifying itself\nto a bright (form); the red form do I sacrifice fot thee into the fire.  \n55\\. Thee here we hand over to the eastern direction, to Agni as sovereign\nlord, to the black serpent as guardian, to \xc3\x82ditya as bowman: do ye guard it\nfor us, until we arrive! To the goal here he shall lead us, to old age; old\nage shall hand us over to death: then shall we be united with the cooked\n(porridge)!  \n56\\. Thee here we hand over to the southern direction, to Indra as sovereign\nlord, to the serpent that is striped across as guardian, to Yama as bowman: do\nye guard it for us, until we arrive! To the goal here, &c.  \n57\\. Thee here we hand over to the western direction, to Varuna as sovereign\nlord, to the pridaku-serpent as guardian, to food as bowman: do ye guard it\nfor us, until we arrive. To the goal here, &c.  \n58\\. Thee here we hand over to the northern direction, to Soma as sovereign\nlord, to the svaga-serpent as guardian, to the lightning as bowman: do ye\nguard it for us, until we arrive. To the goal here, &c.  \n59\\. Thee here we hand over to the direction of the nadir, to Vishnu as\nsovereign lord, to the serpent with black-spotted neck as guardian, to the\nplants as bowmen: do ye guard it for us, until we arrive. To the goal here,\n&c.  \n60\\. Thee here we hand over to the direction of the zenith, to Brihaspati as\nsovereign lord, to the light-coloured serpent as guardian, to the rain as\nbowman: do ye guard it for us, until we arrive. To the goal here, &c.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IX, 3. Removal of a house that has been presented to a priest as\nsacrificial reward](av205.htm)\n\n"
