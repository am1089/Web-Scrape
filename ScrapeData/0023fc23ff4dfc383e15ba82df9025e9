The extending beyond is as in the case of odour.\n\nJust as odour, although a quality, extends beyond the odorous substance--as\nappears from the fact of our perceiving odour even without actually grasping\nflowers which are the seat of odour--so the quality of intelligence also may\nextend beyond the soul although the latter be atomic. It therefore is an undue\nstretch of inference to maintain that a quality, such as colour and the like,\ncannot separate itself from the substratum in which it inheres, because it is\na quality; for we see that odour although a mere quality does separate itself\nfrom its substratum.--The objection that odour also separates itself from its\nsubstance\n\np. 41\n\nonly with the substance (i.e. parts of the substance) we do not admit, because\nthat would involve the dwindling away of the fundamental substance from which\nthe separation of parts takes place. But that it does not so dwindle away, we\nconclude from its remaining in its former condition; otherwise it would lose\nthe heaviness and other qualities belonging to it in its former state.--Well,\nbut perhaps the separation of the particles in which odour resides is not\nnoticed on account of their minuteness. Nevertheless the fact may be that\nminute odorous atoms spreading in all directions enter the cavity of the nose\nand there produce the sensation of smell.--This we cannot admit, because the\natoms are suprasensible, and because in some cases, as, for instance, from the\nblossoms of the nagake _s_ ara-tree, a very strong odour is perceived 1.\nAccording to the generally prevailing idea, moreover, it is not the odorous\nsubstance which is smelled, but ordinary people rather think that they smell\nthe odour only.--The objection that, because we do not perceive colour and so\non to extend beyond their substratum, we have no right to assume that odour\ndoes so, we cannot admit, because there is no room for that conclusion 2, on\naccount of the (actually existing) perception (of the smell apart from the\nodorous substance). Logicians must shape their inferences in such a way as to\nmake them agree with ordinary observation, not in any other way. For, to quote\nanother instance, the circumstance that one of the qualities, viz. taste, is\nperceived by the tongue, certainly does not entitle us to draw the general\ninference that colour and the other qualities also are perceived by means of\nthe tongue.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[41:1](sbe38027.htm#fr_26) Single atoms could not produce any sensations;\ntrasare _n_ us, i.e. combinations of three atoms even could not produce lively\nsensations.\n\n[41:2](sbe38027.htm#fr_27) Viz. that smell cannot exist apart from the odorous\nsubstance, because it is a quality like colour.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 27](sbe38028.htm)\n\n'
