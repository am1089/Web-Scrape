They joined head to head, arm to arm, eye to\neye, and leapt about laying hold of each other\'s feet, and entwining\nthemselves round each other\'s bodies, hugged and shook each other.\n\nThe spectators said to each other, "Brothers! great cruelty is being\nperpetrated at this meeting; what comparison is there between these beautiful\nchildren, and those strong wrestlers, (or what chance have these beautiful\nchildren with those strong wrestlers?) If we prohibit the wrestling, Kuns will\nbe angry; and if we do not, our character for justice will be forfeited. It is\nnot proper for us to stay here as spectators, since we have no power to act."\n\nO great king! whilst the spectators were carrying on this conversation,\nKrishnu and Bulram were contending with the wrestlers. At length the two\nbrothers threw their adversaries and killed them. On their death all the other\nwrestlers rushed upon them; but Krishnu destroyed them also in a second. At\nthis time the worshippers of Huri were rejoiced,\n\np. 158\n\nand playing upon musical instruments, raised shouts of victory; and the gods,\nseated in their chariots in the firmament, celebrated the praises of Krishnu,\nand rained flowers. Kuns being greatly afflicted, restless and enraged, said\nto his attendants, "Why are you playing on musical instruments? What! is the\nvictory of Krishnu agreeable to you?"\n\nHe afterwards added "These two children are very wanton, seize and remove them\nfrom this assembly, and also lay hold of Dewukee and Oogursen, and the\ntreacherous Basoodeo, and bring them here. I will first destroy them, and\nafterwards these two children?" When Kuns had thus spoken, Krishnu, the friend\nof his worshippers, in an instant put all the evil spirits to death, and leapt\nupon a lofty platform, on which Kuns was sitting in great pride and pomp,\nwearing a coat of mail, and with a helmet, shield and sword. On seeing Krishnu\napproach, Kuns regarding him as death, stood erect, and was greatly terrified,\nand began to tremble violently. His secret wish was to fly, but through shame\nhe could not; seizing his sword and shield, he commenced an attack upon\nKrishnu, who contrived to escape from all his attempts to wound him. And the\ngods, men, sages and celestial musicians, who beheld this great encounter,\nwere alarmed, and exclaimed, "O lord! O lord! destroy this wicked sinner\nquickly." The fighting continued for some time on the platform. At length,\nKrishnu, perceiving that all the spectators were afflicted, seized Kuns by the\nhair, and dashed him down from the platform, and leapt down himself.\n\nLife departed from the body of Kuns, when all the assembled people. exclaimed,\n"Shree Krishnu Chund has destroyed Kuns." All the gods, men and sages were\ndelighted at hearing this exclamation.\n\nThe gods being overjoyed then began to glorify Krishnu, and to shower upon the\nearth heaps of flowers. In their delight they played upon the large kettle-\ndrum, raising shouts of victory, and eulogizing Nund. The men and women of the\n\np. 159\n\ncity of Muttra were in the highest degree pleased. And as the beautiful lotus\nof the forest expands into full bloom on beholding the light of the moon, in\nlike manner the inhabitants of Muttra experienced the greatest joy on again\nbeholding Huri.\n\nHaving narrated thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja\nPureechit,--O incarnation of justice! on the death of Kuns, his eight\nbrothers, who were possessed of great strength, came to fight with Krishnu,\nwho destroyed them all. When Huri saw that not a single evil spirit was left,\nhe dragged away the body of Kuns, and brought it to the banks of the Jumna,\nwhere the two brothers sat down and rested; and from that day, the name of\nthat place was "The ghaut of rest."\n\nOn hearing of Kuns\' death, his wives and brothers\' wives came in a state of\ngreat agitation, and with lamentation and tears, to the banks of the Jumna,\nwhere the brothers were sitting and had brought the corpse. They began to look\nupon the face of their lord, and to call to mind the happiness he had\nconferred upon them, and to celebrate his many good qualities; and through\nexcessive grief and affliction they reeled about, and suffered all the agonies\nof death. In the mean while Krishnu, the receptacle of compassion, taking pity\non them, approached and said, "Be not grieved, mothers! but perform the last\nfuneral offices of my uncle, Kuns. No one lives for ever; he speaks falsely,\nwho calls any relation his own. Mothers, fathers, sons, brothers and other\nrelations belong exclusively to none: the revolutions of birth and death\nconstantly succeed each other. So long as a relation remains with us, we\nshould derive pleasure from associating with him."\n\nO great king! when Shree Krishnu Chund had given this explanation to the wives\nof Kuns, they rose up; and being restored to tranquillity of mind, came to the\nbanks of the Jumna, and performed the last obsequies to the corpse of their\nhusband, and Krishnu himself assisted in the funeral rites by lighting the\npile.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XLVI](psa47.htm)\n\n'
