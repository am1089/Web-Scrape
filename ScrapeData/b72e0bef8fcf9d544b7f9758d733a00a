On account of connexions and the rest, as in the case of the separateness\nof other cognitions. And this is seen (elsewhere also); as declared (in the\nPurva Mima _m_ sa).\n\nThat the text enjoins a meditative performance different from the actual\nperformance of which the brick-altar is a constituent element, follows from\nthe reasons proving separation, viz. _the connexions_. i.e. the things\nconnected with the sacrifice, such as the Soma cups, the hymns, the\nrecitations, and so on. What is meant is that the special mention of the cups,\nand so on, made in the passage 'by the mind the Soma cups were drawn thereat,'\nproves the difference of the performance.--The 'and the rest' of the Sutra\ncomprises the previously stated arguments, viz. direct statement, and so on.\n'As other meditations,' i.e. the case is analogous to that of other\nmeditations such as the meditation on the small ether within the heart, which\nare likewise proved by textual statement, and so on, to be different and\nseparate from actual outward sacrificial performances.--The existence of a\nseparate meditative act having thus been ascertained, the requisite injunction\nhas to be construed on the basis of the text as it stands.\n\np. 672\n\nSuch construction of injunctions on the basis of texts of arthavada character\nis seen in other places also; the matter is discussed in Pu. Mi. Sutras III,\n5, 21.--The result of the meditative performance follows from the passage 'of\nthese (altars made of mind, and so on) each is as great as that former one\n(i.e. the altar built of bricks)'--for this implies that the same result which\nthe brick-altar accomplishes through the sacrifice of which it forms an\nelement is also attained through the altars made of mind, and so on, through\nthe meditations of which they form parts.--The next Sutra disposes of the\nargumentation that, as this formal transfer of the result of the brick-altar\nto the altars built of mind, and so on, shows the latter to possess the same\nvirtues as the former, we are bound to conclude that they also form\nconstituent elements of an actual (not merely meditative) performance.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 49.
