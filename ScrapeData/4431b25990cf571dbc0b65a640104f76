On account of (the individual soul) going to the Self.\n\nWith reference to the 'Sat' the text says, 'Learn from me the true nature of\nsleep. When a man sleeps here, he becomes united with the Sat, he is gone to\nhis own (Self). Therefore they say he sleeps (svapiti), because he is gone to\nhis own (sva-apita)' ( _Kh_. Up.VI, 8, 1). This text designates the soul in\nthe state of deep sleep as having entered into, or being merged or reabsorbed\nin, the Self. By reabsorption we understand something being merged in its\ncause. Now the non-intelligent Pradhana cannot be the cause of the intelligent\nsoul; hence the soul's going to its Self can only mean its going to _the_ ,\ni.e. the universal, Self. The term 'individual soul' ( _g_ iva) denotes\nBrahman in so far as having an intelligent substance for its body, Brahman\nitself constituting the Self; as we learn from the text referring to the\ndistinction of names and forms. This Brahman, thus called _g_ iva., is in the\nstate of deep sleep, no less than in that of a general pralaya, free from the\ninvestment of names and forms, and is then designated as mere 'Being' (sat);\nas the text says, 'he is then united with the Sat'. As the soul is in the\nstate of deep sleep free from the investment of name and form, and invested by\nthe intelligent Self only, another text says with reference to the same\nstate,' Embraced by the intelligent Self he knows nothing that is without,\nnothing that is within' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 21). Up to the time of final\nrelease there arise in the soul invested by name and form the cognitions of\nobjects different from itself. During deep sleep the souls divest themselves\nof names and forms, and are embraced by the 'Sat' only; but in the waking\nstate they again invest themselves\n\np. 206\n\nwith names and forms, and thus bear corresponding distinctive names and forms.\nThis, other scriptural texts also distinctly declare, 'When a man lying in\ndeep sleep sees no dream whatever, he becomes one with that pra _n_ a\nalone;--from that Self the pra _n_ as proceed, each towards its place'\n(Kau.Up. 111,3); 'Whatever these creatures are here, whether a lion or a wolf\nor a boar or a gnat or a mosquito, that they become again' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 9,\n3).--Hence the term 'Sat' denotes the highest Brahman, the all-knowing highest\nLord, the highest Person. Thus the V _ri_ ttikara also says, 'Then he becomes\nunited with the Sat--this is proved by (all creatures) entering into it and\ncoming back out of it.' And Scripture also says, 'Embraced by the intelligent\nSelf.'--The next Sutra gives an additional reason.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 11. On account of the uniformity of view](sbe48044.htm)\n\n"
