In the\nbeginning our district was backward, for my husband was unwilling to put any\ncompulsion on the villagers. "Those who make sacrifices for their country\'s\nsake are indeed her servants," he would say, "but those who compel others to\nmake them in her name are her enemies. They would cut freedom at the root, to\ngain it at the top."\n\nBut when Sandip came and settled here, and his followers began to move about\nthe country, speaking in towns and market-places, waves of excitement came\nrolling up to us as well. A band of young fellows of the locality attached\nthemselves to him, some even who had been known as a disgrace to the village.\nBut the glow of their genuine enthusiasm lighted them up, within as well as\nwithout. It became quite clear that when the pure breezes of a great joy and\nhope sweep through the land, all dirt and decay are cleansed away. It is hard,\nindeed, for men to be frank and straight and healthy, when their country is in\nthe throes of dejection.\n\nThen were all eyes turned on my husband, from whose estates alone foreign\nsugar and salt and cloths had not been banished. Even the estate officers\nbegan to feel awkward and ashamed over it. And yet, some time ago, when my\nhusband began to import country-made articles into our village, he had been\nsecretly and openly twitted for his folly, by old and young alike. When\n_Swadeshi_ had not yet become a boast, we had despised it with all our hearts.\n\nMy husband still sharpens his Indian-made pencils with his Indian-made knife,\ndoes his writing with reed pens, drinks his water out of a bell-metal vessel,\nand works at night in the light of an old-fashioned castor-oil lamp. But this\ndull, milk-and-water _Swadeshi_ of his never appealed to us. Rather, we had\nalways felt ashamed of the inelegant, unfashionable furniture of his\nreception-rooms, especially when he had the magistrate, or any other European,\nas his guest.\n\nMy husband used to make light of my protests. "Why allow such trifles to upset\nyou?" he would say with a smile.\n\n"They will think us barbarians, or at all events wanting in refinement."\n\n"If they do, I will pay them back by thinking that their refinement does not\ngo deeper than their white skins."\n\nMy husband had an ordinary brass pot on his writing-table which he used as a\nflower-vase. It has often happened that, when I had news of some European\nguest, I would steal into his room and put in its place a crystal vase of\nEuropean make. "Look here, Bimala," he objected at length, "that brass pot is\nas unconscious of itself as those blossoms are; but this thing protests its\npurpose so loudly, it is only fit for artificial flowers."\n\nThe Bara Rani, alone, pandered to my husband\'s whims. Once she comes panting\nto say: "Oh, brother, have you heard? Such lovely Indian soaps have come out!\nMy days of luxury are gone by; still, if they contain no animal fat, I should\nlike to try some."\n\nThis sort of thing makes my husband beam all over, and the house is deluged\nwith Indian scents and soaps. Soaps indeed! They are more like lumps of\ncaustic soda. And do I not know that what my sister-in-law uses on herself are\nthe European soaps of old, while these are made over to the maids for washing\nclothes?\n\nAnother time it is: "Oh, brother dear, do get me some of these new Indian pen-\nholders."\n\nHer "brother" bubbles up as usual, and the Bara Rani\'s room becomes littered\nwith all kinds of awful sticks that go by the name of _Swadeshi_ pen-holders.\nNot that it makes any difference to her, for reading and writing are out of\nher line. Still, in her writing-case, lies the selfsame ivory pen-holder, the\nonly one ever handled.\n\nThe fact is, all this was intended as a hit at me, because I would not keep my\nhusband company in his vagaries. It was no good trying to show up my sister-\nin-law\'s insincerity; my husband\'s face would set so hard, if I barely touched\non it. One only gets into trouble, trying to save such people from being\nimposed upon!\n\nThe Bara Rani loves sewing. One day I could not help blurting out: "What a\nhumbug you are, sister! When your \'brother\' is present, your mouth waters at\nthe very mention of _Swadeshi_ scissors, but it is the English-made article\nevery time when you work."\n\n"What harm?" she replied. "Do you not see what pleasure it gives him? We have\ngrown up together in this house, since he was a boy. I simply cannot bear, as\nyou can, the sight of the smile leaving his face. Poor dear, he has no\namusement except this playing at shop-keeping. You are his only dissipation,\nand you will yet be his ruin!"\n\n"Whatever you may say, it is not right to be double-faced," I retorted.\n\nMy sister-in-law laughed out in my face. "Oh, our artless little Chota Rani!--\nstraight as a schoolmaster\'s rod, eh? But a woman is not built that way. She\nis soft and supple, so that she may bend without being crooked."\n\nI could not forget those words: "You are his dissipation, and will be his\nruin!" Today I feel--if a man needs must have some intoxicant, let it not be a\nwoman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII](hw24.htm)\n\n'
