If it be said that there is difference on account of the text; we say no;\non account of non-difference.\n\nSo far it has been shown that the non-difference of injunction,\n\np. 633\n\nand so on, establishes the unity of meditations, and that owing to the latter\nthe special features of meditation enjoined in different texts have to be\ncombined. Next, an enquiry is entered upon whether in the case of certain\nparticular meditations there actually exists, or not, that non-difference of\ninjunction which is the cause of meditations being recognised as identical. A\nmeditation on the Udgitha is enjoined in the text of the _Kh_ andogas, as well\nas in that of the Va _g_ asaneyins ( _Kh_. Up. I, 2; B _ri_. Up. I, 3); and\nthe question arises whether the two are to be viewed as one meditation or not.\nThe Purvapakshin maintains the former alternative. For, he says, there is no\ndifference of injunction, and so on, since both texts enjoin as the object of\nmeditation the Udgitha viewed under the form of Pra _n_ a; since there is the\nsame reward promised in both places, viz. mastering of one's enemies; since\nthe form of meditation is the same, the Udgitha being in both cases viewed\nunder the form of Pra _n_ a; since the injunction is the same, being conveyed\nin both cases by the same verbal root (vid, to know); and since both\nmeditations have the same technical name, viz. udgitha-vidya. The Sutra states\nthis view in the form of the refutation of an objection raised by the advocate\nof the final view. We do not admit, the objector says, the unity maintained by\nyou, since the texts clearly show a difference of form. The text of the Va _g_\nasaneyins represents as the object of meditation that which is the agent in\nthe act of singing out the Udgitha; while the text of the _Kh_ andogas enjoins\nmeditation on what is the object of the action of singing out (i. e. the\nUdgitha itself). This discrepancy establishes difference in the character of\nthe meditation, and as this implies difference of the object enjoined, the\nmere non-difference of injunction, and so on, is of no force, and hence the\ntwo meditations are separate ones.--This objection the Purvapakshin impugns,\n'on account of non-difference.' For both texts, at the outset, declare that\nthe Udgitha is the means to bring about the conquest of enemies (Let us\novercome the Asuras at the sacrifices by means of the Udgitha' (B _ri_. Up.);\n'The gods took the Udgitha,\n\np. 634\n\nthinking they would with that overcome the Asuras'-- _Kh_. Up.). In order\ntherefore not to stultify this common beginning, we must assume that in the\nclause 'For them that breath sang out' (B _ri_. Up.), the Udgitha, which\nreally is the object of the action of singing, is spoken of as the agent.\nOtherwise the term udgitha in the introductory passage ('by means of the\nUdgitha') would have to be taken as by implication denoting the agent (while\ndirectly it indicates the instrument).--Hence there is oneness of the two\nvidyas.--Of this view the next Sutra disposes.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 7.
