Garu\xe1\xb8\x8da said: For what sins do they go on that great Way? Why do they fall\ninto the Vaitara\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\xab? Why do they go to hell? Tell me this, O Ke\xc5\x9bava.\n\n2\\. The Blessed Lord said: 'Those who always delight in wrong deeds, who turn\naway from good deeds, go from hell to hell, from misery to misery, from fear\nto fear.\n\n3\\. The righteous go into the city of the King of Justice by three gateways,\nbut the sinful go into it only by the road of the southern gate.\n\n4\\. The Vaitara\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\xab River is only on this very miserable way. I will tell you\nwho the sinners are who go by it.\n\np. 31\n\n5-12. Slayers of Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87s, drinkers of intoxicants, slayers of owe,\ninfanticides, murderers of women, destroyers of the embryo, and those who\ncommit secret sins,\n\nThose who steal the wealth of the teacher, the property of the temple or of\nthe twice-born; those who take away the possessions of women, and those who\nsteal the possessions of children;\n\nThose who do not repay their debts; those who misappropriate deposits; those\nwho betray confidence; and those who kill with poisonous foods;\n\nThose who seize upon the fault and depreciate the merit, who are jealous of\nthose who have merit, who are attached to the wicked, who are foolish, who\nturn away from the company of the good;\n\nThose who despise places of pilgrimage, good men, good actions, teachers and\nShining Ones; those who disparage the Pur\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as, the Vedas, the M\xc4\xabm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x81s\xc4\x81, the\nNy\xc4\x81ya and the Ved\xc4\x81nta;\n\nThose who are elated at seeing the miserable, who try to make the happy\nwretched, who speak evil words, and are always evil-minded;\n\nThose who do not listen to good counsel nor even to the word of the \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81stras,\nwho are self-satisfied, who are unbending, who are foolish, who thinks\nthemselves learned;--\n\nThese, and many others, very sinful, devoid of righteousness, certainly go on\nthe Way of Yama, weeping day and night.\n\n13\\. Beaten by the messengers of Yama, they go towards the Vaitara\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\xab. I will\ntell you what sinners fall into it.\n\n14\\. Those who dishonour their mothers, fathers, teachers and preceptors and\nthe reverend,--these men sink in it.\n\n15\\. Those who wickedly abandon their wives, faithful, of good qualities, of\nnoble birth, and modest, fall into the Vaitara\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\xab.\n\np. 32\n\n16\\. Those who ascribe evil to the good, possessed of thousands of merits, and\ntreat them disrespectfully, fall into the Vaitara\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\xab.\n\n17\\. Who does not fulfil promises made to Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87s, and who, having called\nthem, says, 'There is nothing for you,'--of these two the stay is continued.\n\n18-24. Who takes away what he gave; who repents of his gifts: who takes away\nanother's livelihood; who hinders others making gifts;\n\nWho obstructs sacrifices; who prevents the telling of stories; who removes\nfield-boundaries; who ploughs up pastures;\n\nThe Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87 who sells liquors, and consorts with a lowcaste woman; who kills\nanimals for his own gratification, not for the prescribed sacrifices of the\nVedas;\n\nWho has put aside his Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87ic duties; who eats flesh and drinks liquor; who\nis of unbridled nature; who does not study the \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81stras;\n\nThe \xc5\x9a\xc5\xabdra who studies the letter of the Vedas, who drinks the milk of the\ntawny cow, who wears the sacred thread or consorts with Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87 women;\n\nWho covets the King's wife; who abducts others' wives, who is lustful towards\nvirgins, and who slanders virtuous women;--\n\nThese, and many other fools, fond of treading forbidden paths, anal abandoning\nprescribed ditties, fall into the Vaitara\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\xab.\n\np. 33\n\n23\\. Having come all along the path the sinful reach the abode of Yama, and\nhaving come, by command of Yama, the messengers hurl them into that river\nagain.\n\n26\\. O King of Birds, they then hurl those sinners into the Vaitara\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\xab, which\nis the foremost among hells.\n\n27\\. Who did not make gifts of black cows, nor perform the ceremonies for\nthose who are in the upper body; having suffered great misery in it, go to the\ntree standing on its bank.\n\n28-30. Who give false witness; who perform false duties; who earn by cheating,\nand who gain a livelihood by thieving;\n\nWho cut down and destroy big trees, gardens and forests; who neglect vows and\npilgrimages, who destroy the chastity of widows;\n\nThe woman who despises her husband and thinks about another,--such and others\nat the silk-cotton tree experience much beating.\n\n31\\. Those who fall down, through being beaten, the messengers cast into\nhells. I will tell you about the sinful who fall into them.\n\n32\\. Deniers, those who break the laws of morality, the avaricious, those\nattached to sense-objects, hypocrites, the ungrateful,--these certainly go to\nhell.\n\np. 34\n\n33\\. Those who destroy wells, tanks, ponds, shrines, or people's houses,--\nthese certainly go to hell.\n\n34\\. Those who eat, having neglected their wives, children, servants and\nteachers, and having neglected the offerings to the forefathers and the\nShining Ones,--these certainly go to hell.\n\n35\\. Those who obstruct roads with posts, with mounds, with timber, with\nstones or with thorns,--these certainly go to hell.\n\n36\\. Those who, self-indulgent, do not worship \xc5\x9aiva, \xc5\x9aiv\xc4\x81, Hari, S\xc5\xabrya,\nGa\xe1\xb9\x87e\xc5\x9ba, the wise, and the good teachers,--these certainly go to hell.\n\n37-38. The Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87i who places a harlot on his bed, goes to a low condition;\nbegetting offspring of a \xc5\x9audra woman, he is certainly degraded from the\nBr\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87 rank:\n\nThat wretched twice-born is not worthy of salutation at any time; those fools\nwho worship him certainly go to hell.\n\n39\\. Those who are fond of quarrels, do not give up causing dissension among\nBr\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87s and cow-fights but delight in them,--they certainly go to hell.\n\n40\\. Those who, through malignity, commit transgression at the time of\nconception, with women who have no other refuge,---these certainly go to hell.\n\n41\\. Those men who, blinded by passion, consort with women in the monthly\ncourses, on the four days of lunar change, in the day time, in water, on\n\xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha occasions, these certainly go to hell.\n\np. 35\n\n42\\. Those who throw their bodily refuse into fire, into water, in a garden,\nin a road, or in a cowpen,--these certainly go to hell.\n\n43\\. Those who are makers of swords, and of bows and arrows, and those who are\nsellers of them,--these certainly go to hell.\n\n44\\. Vai\xc5\x9byas who are dealers in skins; women who sell their hair; these who\nsell poisons;--all these certainly go to hell.\n\n45\\. Those who do not compassionate the helpless, who hate the good, who\npunish the guiltless;--these certainly go to hell.\n\n46\\. Those who do not feed the Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87 guests, who have come full of hope to\nthe house, even though food is cooked;--these certainly go to hell.\n\n47\\. Those who are suspicious of all creatures, and who are cruel to them,\nthose who deceive all creatures;--these certainly go to hell.\n\n48\\. Those who assume observances, and afterwards, with senses uncontrolled,\ncast them away again,--these certainly go to hell.\n\n49\\. Those who do not respect the teacher who imparts the knowledge of the\nSupreme Self, and the tellers of the Pur\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as,--these certainly go to hell.\n\n50\\. Those who betray their friends; those who cut short friendship; and those\nwho destroy hopes;--these certainly go to hell.\n\np. 36\n\n51\\. He who interferes with marriage, processions of the Shining Ones, 1 or\nbands of pilgrims, dwells in a dreadful hell from which there is no return.\n\n52\\. The very sinful man who sets fire to a house, a village or a wood, is\ncaptured by the messengers of Yama and baked in pits of fire.\n\n53\\. When his limbs are burnt with fire, he begs for a shady place, and then\nis led by the messengers into the forest of sword-like leaves.\n\n54\\. When his limbs are cut by its leaves, sharp as swords, then they say,\n'Ah, ha! Sleep comfortably in this cool shade!'\n\n55\\. When, afflicted with thirst, he begs for water to drink, then the\nmessengers give him boiling oil to drink.\n\n56\\. Then they say: 'Drink this liquid and eat this food.' As soon as he\ndrinks it he falls down, burning inside.\n\n57\\. Getting up again somehow, he wails piteously. Powerless and breathless he\nis unable even to speak.\n\n58\\. Thus, it is declared, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya, that there are many torments for the\nsinful. Why should I explain them fully, when they are spoken of in all the\n\xc5\x9a\xc4\x81stras?\n\np. 37\n\n59\\. Being tortured thus, men and women by thousands are baked in dreadful\nhells until the coming of the deluge.\n\n60-62. Having eaten there their undecaying fruits they are born again. By\norder of Yama they return to the earth and become unmoving and other\ncreatures:\n\nTrees, bushes, plants, creepers, rocks and grasses, these are spoken of as\nunmoving; enveloped in great delusion,--\n\nInsects, birds, animals and fish;--it is said that there are eighty-four\nhundred thousands of fates of birth-fates.\n\n63\\. All these evolve thence into the human condition; having come back from\nhell they are born in the human kingdom amongst low outcastes, and even there,\nby the stains of sin, become very miserable.\n\n64\\. Thus they become men and women oozing with leprosy, born blind, infested\nwith grievous maladies, and bearing the marks of sin.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[36:1](gpu06.htm#fr_54) The images are carried round the streets on occasions.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter V.
