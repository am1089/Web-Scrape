Its reputed\nauthor, whom we ordinarily find called by his family name, _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana, had\nthe proper name Suya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a. This we may infer from the lists of Vedic\nteachers given in different G _ri_ hya texts where they describe the Tarpa _n_\na ceremony. Though in these lists the order of names varies very much, yet the\ntwo names Suya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a and _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana are constantly placed side by side,\nso that this fact alone would render it probable that they belonged to the\nsame person. Thus we read in the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya IV, 10 = VI, 1:\n\nKahola _m_ Kaushitaki _m_ , Mahakaushitaki _m_ , Suya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a _m_ _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85khayanam, \xc3\x82 _s_ valayanam, Aitareyam, Mahaitareyam.\n\nHere we have grouped together the two Brahma _n_ a authors (with the\nfictitious doubles, the great Kaushitaki, the great Aitareya) and the two\ncorresponding Sutra authors belonging to the two chief branches of the Rig-\nveda literature; first comes one Brahma _n_ a author (for Kahola Kaushitaki is\none person) with the Sutra author connected with him, then the second Sutra\nauthor and the corresponding Brahma _n_ a teacher.\n\nIn the _S_ ambavya-G _ri_ hya (Indische Studien, XV, 154) the corresponding\npassage runs thus:\n\nGargya- Gautama- _S_ akalya- Babhravya- Ma _n_ _d_ attavya\n\np. 4\n\n[paragraph continues] [sic]- Ma _n_ _d_ ukeya _h_ Suya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a- Sa _m_\nkhyayana- _G_ atukar _n_ yeya _h_ [sic] Pai _m_ ga [sic]- _S_ ambavy\xc2\x92-Aitareya\n_h_.\n\nThe same G _ri_ hya still more explicitly bears witness to the name of Suya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana, by adding at the end of the list, from which these\nnames are quoted the following words: Suya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a _S_ akhayanas [sic] t\n_ri_ [pya]tu, i.e. \'May Suya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana satiate himself (with the\nwater offering).\'\n\nIn the \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana-G _ri_ hya III, 4, we read:\n\nKahola _m_ Kaushitaka _m_ Mahakaushitaka _m_ Pai\xe1\xb9\x85gya _m_ Mahapai\xe1\xb9\x85gya _m_ Suya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a _m_ _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayanam Aitareyam Mahaitareyam.\n\nWe may also quote here a Karika given by Naraya _n_ a 1 in his great\ncommentary on the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya (I, 1, 10):\n\nAtrara _n_ ipradana _m_ yad adhvaryu _h_ kurute kva _k_ it 2  \nmata _m_ tan na Suya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ asya, mathita _m_ so \xc2\x92tra ne _k_ _kh_ ati.\n\nIt would perhaps be hazardous to claim for the author of this Karika the\nauthority of an independent witness, for very likely he may have derived his\nknowledge from the lists of teachers which we have quoted before. But at all\nevents the concordance of the three G _ri_ hya texts furnishes a proof which,\nI think, cannot be set aside by another testimony which we must mention now.\nAt the end of the Kaushitaki-\xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka (Adhyaya 15) we find a Va _m_ _s_ a\nor list of the teachers by whom the knowledge contained in that \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka\nis supposed to have been handed down. The opening words of this list run thus:\n\n\'Om! Now follows the Va _m_ _s_ a. Adoration to the Brahman! Adoration to the\nteachers! We have learnt (this text) from Gu _n_ akhya _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana, Gu _n_\nakhya _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana from Kahola Kaushitaki, Kahola Kaushitaki from Uddalaka\n\xc3\x82ru _n_ i, &c:\n\nIt is a very natural supposition that the author of this list intended to\nbegin with the name of the Doctor eponymus, if we may say so, of the Sutras of\nhis school, and then to proceed to name the Doctor eponymus of the Brahma _n_\nas, and after him the more ancient teachers and\n\np. 5\n\nsages. But whether the author of this passage really supposed this Gu _n_\nakhya _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana to be the author of the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-sutras, or not, we\nshall be justified in following rather the unanimous statements of the texts\npreviously quoted, and in accepting in accordance with them, as the full name\nof our Sutrakara, the name Suya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana.\n\nThe G _ri_ hya-sutra which has been here translated presupposes, as all G _ri_\nhya-sutras do, the existence of the _S_ rauta-sutra, with which it is\nintimately connected and which is referred to in the G _ri_ hya in several\ninstances 1.\n\nHere the question arises whether the G _ri_ hya-sutra was composed by the same\nauthor to whom the authorship of the _S_ rauta-sutra belongs, so that the two\ntexts form together, and would, in the conception of their author, be intended\nto form, one great body of Sutras, or, on the other hand, whether the G _ri_\nhya-sutra is a later addition to the _S_ rauta-sutra. On this question I have\nventured, in the preface to my German edition of _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana 2, to offer a\nfew remarks which, however, I feel bound to say do not seem to myself quite\ndecisive. I there pointed out that the G _ri_ hya-sutra contains a few\naphorisms which we should rather expect would have found their place in the\n_S_ rauta-sutra, if the two texts were composed by the same author and on a\ncommon plan 3. But, apart from the possibility that in a work of such\nconsiderable extent as that collection of Sutras would be, such trifling\nincongruences or irregularities might very easily escape the attention even of\na very careful author, there is still another objection that may be urged\nagainst the inference drawn by me from such passages. It can be shown 4 that\nthe G _ri_ hya texts which we possess are based to some extent on one common\noriginal, from which they have taken verbatim, or nearly verbatim, a certain\nnumber of aphorisms. Thus if we were to suppose that _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana,\n\np. 6\n\nor whosoever the author of this G _ri_ hya-sutra may have been, found the\naphorisms on which I once based my argument, in that original text, this would\nexplain the occurrence of those passages in a portion of the great body of\nSutras different from that in which we should expect to meet them. Now several\nof the passages in question recur identically in other G _ri_ hya texts, so\nthat we may infer indeed that they are taken from that lost original, and we\nhave no means to judge whether the other similar passages are not taken from\nit also. I believe, therefore, that the opinion which I once pronounced\nregarding the relation in which the two Sutra texts stand to each other,\ncannot be vindicated, and that it is better to leave that question unanswered\nuntil perhaps further discoveries throw a new light on it.\n\nFor the reconstruction of the correct text of the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya,\nand occasionally also for its interpretation, it is of considerable importance\nthat we possess, besides the Devanagari MSS. of the text and of the\ncommentaries, a South Indian MS. written in the Grantha character (MS. Whish\n78 in the library of the Royal Asiatic Society, London) which contains a G\n_ri_ hya based on that of _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana and following it, during the greater\npart of the work, nearly word for word 1. It is designated in the MS., at the\nend of the single Adhyayas, as \'Kaushitaka-G _ri_ hya.\' It therefore professes\nto follow the teaching of the same Brahma _n_ a which is adhered to also by\nthe Sutra school of _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana. A metrical commentary, which in the MS.\nfollows after the text, names in its opening _S_ loka a teacher _S_ ambavya as\nthe author of this Sutra. The _S_ loka runs thus:\n\nNatva Kaushitaka _k_ arya _m_ _S_ ambavya _m_ sutrak _ri_ ttamam  \ng _ri_ hya _m_ tadiya _m_ sa _m_ kshipya vyakhyasye bahuvism _ri_ tam.\n\n(\'Having bowed to the most excellent author of Sutras, to _S_ ambavya, the \xc3\x82\n_k_ arya belonging to the Kaushitaka school, I shall compose a short\ncommentary on his G _ri_ hya, which has been forgotten by many.\')\n\nThe name of this _S_ ambavya does not occur among the\n\np. 7\n\nteachers enumerated in the description of the Tarpa _n_ a ceremony, neither in\n_S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana IV, 10, nor in \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana III, 4; but in the list of the _S_\nambavya-G _ri_ hya itself it is found (see above, p. 4); and besides it seems\nto me also to be mentioned in \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana-G _ri_ hya IV, 8, 24, in which\npassage it will scarcely be considered too bold to conjecture _S_ ambavya\ninstead of _S_ a _m_ vatya.\n\nThough the MS. of the _S_ ambavya-G _ri_ hya is very confused, and full of\nblunders of all sorts, yet it deserves to be attentively studied by all\nscholars who are accustomed to look, if not in theory yet in practice, on the\nagreement of a few Vedic text MSS., or of a few Indian commentaries, as if it\nhad a claim to an unassailable authority to which European Orientalists would\nhave no right to deny their faith. In the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya a number of\npassages are found in which corrupt readings or perverse explanations are\nsupported by all the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana MSS. and by all the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana\ncommentaries, and if, by a rare and fortunate chance, the _S_ ambavya Grantha\nMS., which is unaffected by the blunders of the Devanagari MSS., had not been\ndiscovered in the south of the peninsula, these readings and explanations\nwould seem to rest on the unanimous agreement of tradition. Perhaps it seems\nunnecessary to dwell on this point, for very few Orientalists, if any, would\nbe prepared to assert that Indian tradition is infallible. But when looking\nover many of the editions and translations of the Vedic texts; even such as\nhave been published in the last years, one finds plentiful occasion to observe\nthat in hundreds of passages tradition has been practically treated, by\nscholars of very high merit, as if it had an authority not very far removed\nfrom infallibility. A case like that of which we have to speak here, in which\na whole set of MSS., and occasionally also of commentaries, can be tested by a\nMS. of a nearly related text, written in a different character and in a\ndistant part of India, will strengthen our belief that we are right in judging\nfor ourselves, even if that judgment should oppose itself to such authorities\nas Naraya _n_ a or Rama _k_ andra or _G_ ayarama.\n\nPerhaps it will not be out of place to add here, as an\n\np. 8\n\nillustration of these remarks, a few observations on one of the passages in\nwhich the rejection of the traditional _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana reading, together with\nthe traditional _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana explanation, is confirmed by the _S_ ambavya\nMS., though no doubt, even without the aid of that MS., we ought to have\nformed the right conclusions for ourselves. At _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana II, 4, 1. 2 the\ntraditional reading is:\n\nMama vrate h _ri_ daya _m_ te dadhami mama _k_ ittam anu _k_ itta _m_ to astu\n| mama va _k_ am ekamana _g_ ushasva B _ri_ haspatish _t_ va niyunaktu mahyam\niti | kamasya brahma _k_ aryasyasav iti.\n\n_S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana is treating here of the Upanayana, or the initiation of the\nstudent who is received by a teacher and intends to study the Veda with him.\nThe teacher on that occasion is to pronounce the Mantra which we have just\ntranscribed, and which translated into English would run thus:\n\n\'Under my will I take thy heart; after my mind shall thy mind follow; in my\nword thou shalt rejoice with all thy heart; may B _ri_ haspati join thee to\nme.\' \'Of the Brahma _k_ arya of Kama (or lust), N.N.!\'\n\nThe MSS. give the end of the passage as we have printed it above, kamasya\nbrahma _k_ aryasyasav iti. This Naraya _n_ a explains in the following way.\nBrahma _k_ arya here means the observances which the student has to keep\nthrough certain periods of time before the different texts which he has to\nlearn can be taught him. First comes the Savitri verse, for which he prepares\nhimself by observing the savitra vrata; this lasts either one year, or three\ndays, or the Savitri can also be taught him immediately (see chap. 5, 1-3).\nThen follows the _s_ ukriya vrata, of three days, or twelve days, or one year,\nor any other period of time according to the teacher\'s pleasure (chap. 11,\n10); by this vrata the student is enabled to study the main portion of the\nVeda. Finally come the _s_ akvara, vratika, aupanishada observances, each of\nwhich has to last one year, and which refer to the different parts of the \xc3\x82ra\n_n_ yaka (see chap. 11, 11 seq., and the sixth book). Now the formula of which\nwe treat here refers principally to the savitra\n\np. 9\n\nvrata. The teacher announces to the student how long he has to keep that\nvrata. He says (Sutra 1), \'May B _ri_ haspati join thee to me (Sutra 2) for a\nbrahma _k_ arya (i.e. a vrata) of such and such (kamasya) a time (one year,\nthree days, &c.); N.N.!\' Kama (the pleasure) would thus stand here as an\nexpletive which was to be replaced in each single case by the indication of\nthe real space of time that depended on the teacher\'s pleasure (\'. . .\nniyunaktu mahya _m_ sa _m_ vatsarikasya trairatrikasya vanvakshikasya va\nsavitrasya brahma _k_ aryasyamukamuka _s_ armann iti vakyasa _m_ yogo _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\neya _h_ \'). The same should take place at the corresponding forms of Upanayana\nwhich had to precede the entrance of the student upon the _s_ ukriya, _s_\nakvara, &c. observances. This is the explanation of Naraya _n_ a, with which\nRama _k_ andra and all the other commentaries agree. It will scarcely be\nnecessary to observe that the singular use of k a ma, on which this\ntraditional explanation rests, is neither in accordance with the meaning of\nthe word, nor supported by any parallel texts. So, even before I had the\nopportunity of collating the _S_ ambavya MS., I had no doubt that the system\nof the Vratas has nothing at all to do with our Sutra, and that its text\nshould be made intelligible by a slight alteration touching only the quantity\nof the a in two syllables, by writing, Kamasya brahma _k_ ary asy asav iti\n(thou art the Brahma _k_ arin of Kama, N.N.!), as we read in \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana I,\n20, 8, kasya brahma _k_ aryasi, pra _n_ asya brahma _k_ ary asi. Afterwards I\nfound that the Grantha MS. of _S_ ambavya gives the very reading which I had\nconjectured.\n\nPassages like this are not very rare in the G _ri_ hya-sutras. In the other\nSutras we are not in the same favourable position of possessing a MS. which\nenables us, as the Grantha MS. of _S_ ambavya does, to test their text.\n\nWe cannot conclude these introductory remarks without speaking of the later\nadditions tacked on at the end of the original body of the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G\n_ri_ hya-sutras 1. There are unmistakable indications that the fifth and sixth\nbooks are later additions. The fifth book is\n\np. 10\n\ndesignated as a pari _s_ ish _t_ a in a Karika quoted by Naraya _n_ a:\n\npari _s_ ish _t_ ad avasathye parva _n_ atikrame _k_ aru _h_  \nVai _s_ vanarayagnaye _k_ agnaye 1 tantumate tatha.\n\n(\'According to the Pari _s_ ish _t_ a, if one of the half-monthly sacrifices\nhas been omitted, a mess of rice should be offered on the sacred domestic fire\nto Agni Vai _s_ vanara and to Agni Tantumat.\')\n\nThe passages of the Pari _s_ ish _t_ a here referred to are the two first\naphorisms of V, 4:\n\n\'Now if a half-monthly sacrifice has not been performed, one or the other of\nthem, then a mess of rice (is to be offered)\xc2\x97\n\n\'With (the words), "To Agni Vai _s_ vanara svaha! To Agni Tantumat svaha!\'"\n\nThere are, besides, several passages in which Naraya _n_ a himself mentions\nthe fifth book under the designation of Pari _s_ eshadhyaya 2. And even if we\nhad not the authority of the Karika and of Naraya _n_ a, the contents alone of\nthe fifth book would raise our suspicion against its genuineness. The matter\nordinarily treated of in the G _ri_ hya texts is brought to an end in Adhyayas\nI-IV; in the fifth book we find diverse supplementary additions on points\ndiscussed before; rules, which no doubt would have been given at their proper\nplace, had the fifth book been composed at the same time, and by the same\nauthor, as the preceding books 3. Besides, we find different praya _s_ _k_\nitta oblations treated of, and a description of two ceremonies which are\nmentioned, as far as I know, in no other G _ri_ hya-sutra, but belong to the\nrites frequently described in such works as Pura _n_ as, Pari _s_ ish _t_ as,\nand later Dharma texts: the consecration of ponds or wells (chap. 2), and the\nconsecration of gardens (chap. 3).\n\nThere can thus be little doubt as to the secondary character of the fifth\nbook. And this alone suffices to\n\np. 11\n\nfurnish an important argument in favour of the same view with regard to the\nsixth book also. This view is furthermore supported by the opening invocation\nin that book, addressed to Brahman and to a number of mythological beings and\nVedic sages and teachers. It is evident that by such an invocation this book\nis characterised as a separate treatise, presupposing of course the main body\nof the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-sutras, but not forming part of it in the same sense in\nwhich, for instance, the second or the third Adhyaya does. The object of that\ntreatise is the exposition of the ritual connected with the study of the\nRahasya texts. The sixth book, composed no doubt by a later adherent of the\n_S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana school, returns, in fact, to, and enlarges on, matters that have\nalready found their proper place in the original G _ri_ hya-sutra at II, 12,\nand partly also at IV, 7.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[3:1](sbe29002.htm#fr_0) See IV, 5, 9.\n\n[4:1](sbe29002.htm#fr_1) Manuscr.
