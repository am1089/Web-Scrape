The Self, on account of subject-matter.\n\nThe subject-matter of the whole section shows that by the Self manifesting\nitself in its own form there is meant the Self as possessing the attributes of\nfreedom from all evil and sin and so on. For the teaching of Pra _g_ apati\nbegins as follows: 'the Self which is free from sin, free from old age, from\ndeath and grief, from hunger and thirst, whose desires and thoughts\nspontaneously realise themselves.' And that this Self which forms the subject-\nmatter of the entire section is the individual Self we have shown under I, 3,\n19. The manifestation of the true nature of the soul when\n\np. 758\n\nreaching the highest light therefore means the manifestation of that Self\nwhich has freedom from sin and so on for its essential attributes-that nature\nbeing in the Sa _m_ sara state obscured through Nescience. When therefore at\nthe moment of Release those essential qualities assert themselves, the case is\none of manifestation of what already exists, not one of origination. Thus the\nreverend _S_ aunaka says, 'As the lustre of the gem is not created by the act\nof polishing, so the essential intelligence of the Self is not created by the\nputting off of imperfections. As the well is not the cause of the production\nof rain water, but only serves to manifest water which already exists--for\nwhence should that originate which is not?--thus knowledge and the other\nattributes of the Self are only manifested through the putting off of evil\nqualities; they are not produced, for they are eternal.' Intelligence,\ntherefore, bliss, and the other essential qualities of the soul which were\nobscured and contracted by Karman, expand and thus manifest themselves when\nthe bondage due to Karman passes away and the soul approaches the highest\nlight. On this view of 'manifestation' there remains no difficulty.--Here\nterminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'on approaching manifestation.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 4.
