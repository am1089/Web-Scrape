They have worshipped Vai _s_ vanara with his broad stream of light with\nprayers [1](sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:1:1) and treasures in order that he may walk\non firm ground. For immortal Agni honours the gods, and from of old he has not\nviolated the laws.\n\n2\\. The wonderful messenger goes between the two worlds (heaven and earth),\nthe Hot _ri_ who has sat down, the Purohita of Manus. He takes care of his\nwide dwelling day by day, Agni who, incited by the gods, gives wealth for our\nprayers.\n\n3\\. The priests have exalted with their thoughts Agni, the banner of\nsacrifices, the achiever of sacrifice [1](sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:3:1). From him\nin whom they have put together their (sacrificial) works and their prayers,\nthe sacrificer desires blessings.\n\n4\\. The father of sacrifices, the miraculous lord of those who know prayers\n(?) [1](sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:4:1), Agni, is the measure and rule\n[2](sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:4:2) of the sacrificers; he has entered the two\nmanifold-shaped worlds; the sage beloved by many people is glorified in his\nfoundations.\n\n5\\. The gods have established here in great beauty Agni the bright with his\nbright chariot, whose every law is golden [1](sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:5:1), Vai\n_s_ vanara who dwells in the waters, who finds the sun, the diver, the swift\none covered with strength, the quick one.\n\n6\\. Agni, spreading out with his thought the manifold-adorned sacrifice,\ntogether with the gods and\n\np. 233\n\nwith the people of Manus, goes as a charioteer to and fro with (gods and men)\nwho accomplish the sacrifice, the quick, domestic (god), the dispeller of\ncurses.\n\n7\\. Agni, be wakeful [1](sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:7:1) in our life which may be\nblessed with offspring; swell with sap; shine upon us (plenty of) food. Stir\nup vigour and the great ones, O watchful (god). Thou art the U _s_ i _g_ (or\nwilling one) of the gods, the good-minded (lord) of prayers.\n\n8\\. The lord of the tribe, the vigorous [1](sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:8:1) guest,\nthe guider of prayers, the U _s_ i _g_ (or willing one) of those who invoke\nhim, _G_ atavedas, the light of worship--him men constantly praise with\nadoration, with solicitations for their welfare.\n\n9\\. The resplendent, joyous god, Agni on his chariot, has with his might\nencompassed the dwellings. May we honour in our house with beautiful prayers\n[1](sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:9:1) his commands who is rich in manifold prosperity.\n\n10\\. O Vai _s_ vanara, I love thy statutes by which thou hast found the sun, O\nfar-seeing one. When born thou hast filled the worlds, heaven and earth; Agni,\nthou encompassest all these (beings) by thyself.\n\n11\\. For Vai _s_ vanara's wonderful deeds he the sage alone has by his great\nskill mightily [1](sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:11:1) let loose (his powers?). Agni has\nbeen born exalting. both his parents, Heaven and Earth, rich in seed.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi and metre.--Verse 10 = MS. IV, 11, 1. Verse 11 = TS. I, 5,\n11, 1.\n\np. 234\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. A meaning like 'prayer' seems to recommend itself for most of the\npassages in which the substantive vip occurs, for instance, V, 68, 1. pra va\n_h_ mitra\xc2\xb4ya gayata varu _n_ aya vip gira\xc2\xb4; IX, 22, 3. ete puta\xc2\xb4 _h_ vipa _s_\n_k_ ita _h_ somasa _h_ \xe2\x80\xa6 vipa\xc2\xb4 vi a\xc2\xb4na _s_ u _h_ dhiya _h_ ; IX, 65, 12. aya\xc2\xb4\n_k_ itta _h_ vipa\xc2\xb4 anaya hari _h_ pavasva dha\xc2\xb4raya; III, 10, 5 (see below),\n&c. As the verb vip means 'to be in trembling agitation,' the same word as a\nsubstantive may designate enthusiastic thoughts or prayers. Comp. vepate\nmati\xc2\xb4, IX, 71, 3; X, II, 6, and the nouns vipra, vipa _s_ _k_ it, vipodha\xc2\xb4. We\nneed not enter here upon the question, whether some concrete trembling or\nshaking objects also were designated as vipa _h_ , and whether Bergaigne\n(Religion Vedique, I, p. vii) is right in taking the vip aya _h_ -agra, with\nwhich Trita killed the boar (X, 99, 6), as a 'priere a pointe de fer' (comp.\nMacdonell, Journ. R. Asiatic Society, 1893, p. 431; 1895, p. 185).--In our\nverse vipa _h_ may be either nominative or accusative. I have translated it as\nan accusative; in the case of the nominative the translation would be: 'The\nprayers have worshipped Vai _s_ vanara with treasures.'\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. The text has vidathasya.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. \xc3\x81sura _h_ vipa _h_ - _k_ itam. On the meaning of asura, which implies\nthe possession of secret, supernatural power, see H. O., Religion des Veda,\n162 seq.--Comp. von Bradke, Dyaus Asura, pp. 64-65.\n\nNote 2. 'Richtschnur und Weg der Opferer,' Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 306.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Literally, 'whose rules are yellow.' The meaning is that Agni's whole\nsphere of activity bears the golden\n\np. 235\n\nyellow colour. Saya _n_ a gives the interesting remark 'haritva _k_ am iti _s_\nakhantaram,' but no doubt harivratam is right.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. Comp. Neisser, Bezzenberger's Beitrage, XIII, 297.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. Comp. I, 36, 1, note 2.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. Comp. II, 4, 1, note 1.\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. Prof. Max Muller proposes to translate, 'has sent forth his great\nsong,' and observes, 'Might not b _ri_ hat be like b _ri_ hat sa\xc2\xb4ma, a name of\na hymn?'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4. \xc3\x82pri Hymn](sbe46064.htm)\n\n"
