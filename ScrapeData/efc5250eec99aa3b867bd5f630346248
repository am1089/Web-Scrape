O servant!\nput false pride away, and seek for Him within you.  \nA million suns are ablaze with light,  \nThe sea of blue spreads in the sky,  \nThe fever of life is stilled, and all stains are washed away; when I sit in\nthe midst of that world.  \nHark to the unstruck bells and drums! Take your delight in love!  \nRains pour down without water, and the rivers are streams of light.  \nOne Love it is that pervades the whole world, few there are who know it fully:  \nThey are blind who hope to see it by the light of reason, that reason which is\nthe cause of separation--  \nThe House of Reason is very far away! p. 143  \nHow blessed is Kabir, that amidst this great joy he sings within his own\nvessel.  \nIt is the music of the meeting of soul with soul;  \nIt is the music of the forgetting of sorrows;  \nIt is the music that transcends all coming in and all going forth.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XCVIII](sok099.htm)\n\n'
