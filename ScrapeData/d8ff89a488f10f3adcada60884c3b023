Venkataramanan, [1921], at\nsacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 199\n\n### Definition of One\'s Own Self.\n\nI salute the two feet of the holy Master, which destroy (this) unendurable\nduality, and whose dust, like the sacred ashes, quell the demon of illusion.\n(1).\n\nI salute the merciful and most excellent Master who destroys all doubts and\nwhose two feet reveal the enjoyment of one-ness as the meaning of the word\n"that". (2).\n\np. 200\n\nScorched by the forest-fire of phenomenal existence, the pupil, possessed of\nall necessary qualifications, is thus enlightened by the Master with words\ncapable of revealing the true self. (3).\n\nWhoever doubts the fact that himself exists? If even this is doubted, he who\ndoubts is only thyself. (4).\n\np. 201\n\nWhen one knows "I am not", it is verily Brahman itself that knows "it is not."\nWhen one knows "I am", then (too) it is that Brahman itself that knows thus.\n(5).\n\nThyself, therefore, art Brahman. "I am not Brahman" is a mere illusion. From\nillusion springs separation * wherein all sorrows have root. (6).\n\nHe who gains a clear knowledge of the five sheaths (of the self) does not\nexperience the five sufferings. \xe2\x80\xa0 The wise, therefore, always investigate the\nfive sheaths. (7).\n\np. 202\n\nBy a clear knowledge of the five sheaths, _anna-maya_ , _pr ana-maya_, _mano-\nmaya_ , _vijn ana-maya_ and _a nanda-maya_, each within the one before it, the\nself becomes capable of being revealed. (8).\n\nThis (gross) body which is called the _anna-maya_ sheath, is not the self, for\nit is non-sentient, almost like an earthen vessel, and is non-existent before\nbirth and after death. (9).\n\np. 203\n\nSo much of the atmosphere as is contained by the body is the _pr ana-maya_\nsheath. How can this be the self, being afflicted with hunger and thirst?\n(10).\n\nNor can the _mano-maya_ sheath be the self, which thinks of the body as \'I\'\nand of home, etc., as \'mine\', and which is the slave of likes and dislikes.\n(11).\n\nNor can the individual consciousness known by the name of _vijn ana-maya_\n(sheath), be the self, for it is only a reflection of the pure consciousness,\n* disappearing in deep sleep and permeating the whole body in conscious\nmoments. (12).\n\np. 204\n\nHow can I-ness (or egoism), which is called the _a nanda-maya_ sheath, be the\nself, fondly imagining "I am happy" by reason of the small fractions of bliss\nfound in deep sleep?(13).\n\nThat which shines as the reality is bliss itself, is the self of all, for it\nexists before and after, is changeless and uncontradictable. (14).\n\np. 205\n\nIf nothing different from the annamaya and other sheaths is perceived, it\ncannot nevertheless he denied that there is one that Perceives the _annamaya_\n, etc., sheaths. (15).\n\nAlthough the self, being of the very nature of consciousness, cannot therefore\nbe the object of consciousness, nevertheless there can never be a doubt\nregarding the absolute existence of consciousness itself. (16).\n\nThe self experiences all things, but cannot be experienced by anything. The\nsun, that illumines the whole world, is not, in its turn, illumined. (17).\n\np. 206\n\nWhat is neither that nor this, so or thus, that much or this much,--that\nshould be understood to be Brahman. Otherwise, it will be a mere object, and\nnot directly knowable. (18).\n\nWhile everything that is perceived as \'this, this\' is contradictable *, the\nreality that is \'not this\' is not contradictable. It is, moreover, not\nunrealisable, because it exists. (19).\n\np. 207\n\nBrahman, although not knowable (by the intellect), is yet not unrealisable,\nbecause it is self-resplendent. The passage, "Brahman is reality, knowledge,\ninfinity", expresses the definition thereof. (20).\n\nAs long as there is limitation by the powers of the sheaths, the conditions of\nindividual soul and Supreme Self affect it. Otherwise, these two conditions\ndisappear, and its real nature without any distinction shines forth. (21).\n\nIf it is determined by ordinary reasoning that, when everything visible is\nknown to be unreal, there is naught at all, it is further determined by the\nVedas that what is established as naught at all, is Brahman itself. (22).\n\np. 208\n\nAlthough this is so, to those that are devoid of even a thought of passages\nlike "that thou art", the self, though (ever) resplendent within, becomes, as\nit were, invisible. (23).\n\nTherefore, by a contemplation of the meaning of such passages through an\nexamination of their word-meanings, and by the glory of the grace of the\nMaster, one directly sees the self in an instant. (24).\n\np. 209\n\nThe expressed meaning of the word \'thou\' is the (individual) consciousness\nthat prides in being doer, (enjoyer,) etc., superimposing the functions of the\nbody, the senses, etc., on the self as if they were identical. (25).\n\nThe derived meaning of the word \'thou\' is the consciousness that manifests\nitself as the. witness of the body, the ego, and the senses, distinct from\nthem. (26).\n\nThe expressed meaning of the word "that" is the supreme self which is knowable\nfrom Vedantic texts, which is the efficient cause of the whole universe, and\nwhich is endowed with omniscience, etc. (27).\n\np. 210\n\nThe derived meaning of the word "that" is the supreme self, free of all\ncondition whatsoever, beyond all phenomena, absolute, second-less, eternal,\nand realisable by (direct) experience. (28).\n\nThe relation between the two word-meanings is either sameness of object, or\nthe relation of attribute and subject, or that of indicated and indicator.\n(29).\n\np. 211\n\nThose versed in interpretation explain "sameness of object" as the application\nof words, individually denoting different objects, to denote together the same\nobject. (30).\n\nVisibility and invisibility, fullness and the having a second, are mutually\ncontradictory. Therefore, in the case on hand, the derived meaning alone is\npossible. (31).\n\nDerivation of meaning is the denotation of an object not unconnected with the\nprimary\n\np. 212\n\nmeaning, in a case where the primary meaning cannot be adopted owing to its\ncontradiction by other reasons. (32)\n\nExclusive derivation of meaning * is the denotation of a different object\nconnected with the expressed meaning, but completely exclusive of the latter;\nfor instance, the hamlet on the Ganges \xe2\x80\xa0. Such derivation of meaning is not\napplicable to the present case. (33).\n\np. 213\n\nInclusive derivation of meaning is the denotation of another object without\nabandoning the expressed meaning; for instance, the red * (one) is running.\nSuch derivation, too, should not be adopted in the present case. (34).\n\nThe partly exclusive and partly inclusive derivation is that which excludes a\nportion of the expressed object and denotes another portion thereof; for\ninstance, "this is that Brahmin". This mode of derivation should be adopted in\nthe present case. (35).\n\np. 214\n\nThe sentence, "this is that Brahmin", indicates the Brahmin alone by excluding\nthe remoteness and the nearness of place, (time), etc., and thus denotes\nidentity between the meanings of the two words (\'this\' and \'that\'.) (36).\n\nIn the same way, the sentence, "that thou art", indicates the Supreme Self\nthat is the reality, by excluding directness and remoteness, etc., and thus\nclearly denotes identity * by the word "art." (37).\n\nIn regard to those that realise as "I" the reality thus indicated by the\nprincipal text\n\np. 215\n\ndeclaring identity, the Vedas declare that they shall be free from all sorrow.\n(38).\n\nIt is generally observed, both in secular and Vedic matter, that words of\ninjunction (alone) are capable of inciting one to action. How can the same\nhold good in the case of passages like "that thou art" which (merely) reveal a\nthing already established? (39).\n\nIt is not injunction alone that can incite one to action, but also an\nassertion regarding a desired object. A person will begin to act by virtue of\nthe knowledge. "Here is the king" or "a son has been born." (40).\n\np. 216\n\nAlthough, according to the Vedic passages declaring identity, the self is\nincessantly revealed, yet it is not possible to realise it for those that are\ndevoid of the grace of the Master. (41).\n\nDo not think, \'what is the need for a Master, since one, by himself, can\nattain a knowledge of the self by avoiding optional and prohibited rites and\nby purifying the mind through the performance of prescribed rites?\' (42).\n\np. 217\n\nKnowledge (of self) cannot result from rites alone, without the Master that is\nthe ocean of mercy; for it is established by the Vedas that only he who has a\nMaster can know. (43).\n\nThe Vedas are the highest authority, either because they are beginningless or\nbecause they are the utterances of the Supreme Lord. Knowledge, (therefore)\ncannot result either by itself or from any other authority. (44).\n\nThe Vedic sentence, which does not depend on any other proof, but on which\ndepend all\n\np. 218\n\nproofs, is the only source of the knowledge of Brahman and other things that\nare beyond the senses. (45).\n\nThose that attempt, by means of proof, to realise a knowledge which reveals\nthe proof itself, are such wonderful beings that they will burn fire itself by\nmeans of fuel. (46).\n\nThe Veda is beginningless, and the self-resplendent Lord himself manifests it.\nIn view of its manifestation thus, the great ones have declared that it is the\n(highest) authority. (47).\n\np. 219\n\nAs no authority is equal to the eye in the perception of forms, so is there no\nauthority for knowledge, equal to the Veda, in the realisation of that which\nis beyond perception. (48).\n\nIf any treatise elucidates a truth established by the Vedas, it is merely a\nrepetition and is not indicative of any authority whatsoever. (49).\n\np. 220\n\nOf the Vedas consisting of two parts, one part * enunciates duality and the\nother \xe2\x80\xa0 plainly expounds the one (secondless) reality. (50).\n\nThe secondless alone is real. Duality. being only superimposed thereon, is not\nreal, like (the illusion of) silver in the mother-o\'-pearl, or the appearance\nof water in a mirage. (51).\n\nIt is not proper to say that the secondless reality may be superimposed on the\nunreal and dual; for superimposition is (always) that of the unreal on the\nreal. (52).\n\np. 221\n\nBoth cannot be superimposed, for there is naught different from them and\nsuperimposition cannot be on nothing. Hence, the reality of the secondless (\n_self_ ) must be accepted. (53).\n\nWhat is expounded by the Vedas is the secondless (Brahman) that cannot be\nknown by direct perception and other proofs, and not duality, for the latter\nis already established by ordinary reasoning. (54).\n\np. 222\n\nThe secondless (Brahman) is of the nature of happiness, while duality is\nalways unendurable misery. The Vedas, therefore, expound only that * which is\naspired for. (55).\n\nIn respect of the secondless reality which is expounded by the Vedas and which\nis of the nature of bliss, some say that the condition of individual self is\nits ordinary nature. (56).\n\nIf the condition of individual self be the very nature of (Brahman that is)\nabsolute consciousness, then, like the heat and light of fire, it can never\ndisappear. (57).\n\np. 223\n\nSome are of opinion that the individual soul becomes the supreme soul by\nvirtue of spiritual effort in the same way as iron becomes gold by the action\nof some chemical. (58).\n\nThis is not right; for when the power of the chemical disappears by lapse of\ntime, the golden colour that was imparted to the iron, also disappears. (59).\n\np. 224\n\nIn the same way, the condition of individual soul, with its characteristics of\npleasure and pain, will only seem to disappear (according to the above\nreasoning), but will not be utterly destroyed. (60).\n\nTherefore, if, by its very nature, it is the individual self, it will for ever\nremain the individual self. \'In the same way, if (by its very nature) it is\nthe supreme self, it stands to reason that it is always the supreme self.\n(61).\n\nEven if the individual soul were to attain (only a) similarity with the\nsupreme self by virtue of spiritual efforts, it has been decided\n\np. 225\n\nby all authorities that even that similarity must necessarily perish after\nsome time *. (62).\n\nHaving therefore destroyed, by the knowledge of the self, the insuperable\nignorance regarding one\'s self and phenomenal limitation ( _sams ara_) which\nis of the nature of (that) ignorance, one becomes oneself the Infinite, and\nnaught else remains. (63).\n\nAll the Vedas and all religious treatises ( _smriti_ ) expound the supreme\nsecondless Self whose nature is reality, knowledge and bliss as the thing to\nbe realised. (64)\n\np. 226\n\nIn respect of all the numerous Vedic passages declaring oneness, all other\npassages are said to be subordinate thereto. (65).\n\n * From passages like "that thou art," how does the knowledge of non-duality spring up, at whose very origin the conditions of doer, etc., disappear, like darkness at the rise of the sun? (66).\n\np. 227\n\nThose versed in ritual argue that knowledge occurs in the ritual portion (of\nthe Veda) and is therefore an auxiliary to ritual. But how can knowledge be an\nauxiliary to ritual, since it occurs in a quite different context? (67).\n\nThe two portions (of the Veda) relating to ritual and knowledge, are entirely\ndifferent, both in respect of the aspirant\'s qualifications and the subject\ndealt with. This being so, how can they be principal and auxiliary in relation\nto each other? (68).\n\np. 228\n\nKnowledge cannot exist in ritual. So, too, ritual cannot exist in knowledge.\nHow is any correlation possible between the two, which are like sun and\ndarkness? (69),\n\nTherefore, for the removal^ of illusion, knowledge does not need the\nassistance of anything else, in the same way as the sun for the dispulsion of\nthe densest darkness. (70).\n\nThe supreme self that is the witness of al;. is itself that unsullied\nknowledge. The witness, therefore, is not affected by those limitations (of\nignorance) but is (even) reality, knowledge and bliss. (71).\n\np. 229\n\nIts relation to them as (subject and) object is (illusory) like the relation\nof rope, etc., to serpent, etc. The Vedas, too, establish the same truth by\ndeclaring "this (self) is ever unattached". (72)\n\nThat which cognises both subject and object is the supreme self itself.\nNeither of them can know it. That which is neither subject nor object can\nalone know (itself) clearly. (73).\n\np. 230\n\nSome say that the nature of doer, (enjoyer,) etc. and all else is manifested\n(in the self) by its power of _m aya_. This is (however) a delusion, because\nthere is naught other than Brahman. (74).\n\nThat Brahman being known, all this universe will become known, in the same way\nas all earthern jars, pots, etc., become known by the clay, which is their\ncause, being known. (75).\n\nThis (Brahman), then, is the one cause, devoid of all distinction, of the\nnature of purest\n\np. 231\n\nconsciousness. From that which is the sole reality, conditioned by _m aya_,\nsprang forth all this universe. (76).\n\nSome say that the cause is non-entity. (But) the non-existent cannot be a\ncause. The power to generate a sprout is visible to all, only if the seed\nexists. (77).\n\nHe who declares the cause to be non-entity, can manage affairs with the son of\na barren woman and quench intense thirst by drinking the water of a mirage.\n(78).\n\np. 232\n\nAs this doctrine of a non-existent cause is untenable both according to\nscripture and reason, it follows that real entity is alone the cause of all\nthe worlds. (79)\n\nThis reality, higher than the highest, manifests itself as the worlds, also as\nteacher and pupil, also as (the four-faced) Brahman and other gods. (80).\n\nFor those whose minds are not ripe, the impression that the world is real will\ntend to\n\np. 233\n\nbondage (of births and deaths). Hence, the Vedantas declare all this universe\nto be unreal. (81)\n\nOn the other hand, to those great persons whose minds have become ripe by\nvirtue of their past merits, the Vedas declare that all this universe is\nBrahman alone. (82).\n\nThose that do not realise the gold understand a golden ornament only as an\nornament. So, too, those that are devoid of realisation do not perceive the\nworld to be Brahman. (83).\n\np. 234\n\nHow can Brahman be unknown to anyone, which is realisable by means of I-ness?\n* And yet, it is impossible of realisation by the un-enquiring ignorant. (84).\n\nAll persons carry on their activities at all times by means of the ideas "I"\nand "this". Of these, the former relates to the inner self, and the latter to\nexternal objects like the body, the senses, etc. (85).\n\np. 235\n\nIf the idea of "I" springs up in respect of the body, senses, etc., it is then\na huge delusion; for, delusion is defined as the perception of anything in\nwhat is not that thing. (86).\n\nIt therefore stands to reason that the supreme self that is the witness of all\nis alone denoted by the idea "I". This I-ness, although devoid of\nconsciousness, becomes conscious, as it were, by its contact with the self.\n(87).\n\nThe direct meaning of the clear and unmixed conception, "I", "I", in all\nbodies is therefore Brahman alone. (88)\n\np. 236\n\nBy the word "cow", the genus \'cow\' is primarily meant; but, from the context,\na particular cow is also indicated. In the same way, the primary meaning of\n"I" is the supreme self, but, by virtue of delusion, becomes the ego. (89).\n\nJust as the power to burn, etc., is manifest in iron by reason of its contact\nwith fire, so do the conditions of doer, (enjoyer) etc., manifest themselves\nin the "I" by reason of its connection with the self. (90).\n\np. 237\n\nHaving understood the meaning of "I" to be the pure, transcendental,\nsecondless (self) that is different from the body, senses and other objects,\none should not attribute any other meaning thereto. (9l).\n\nJust as, in the same body, the pleasures and pains are numerous in respect of\nthe various limbs, so, too, there are differences of experiences in respect of\nthese individual souls, although there is really no differentiation at all:\n(92).\n\np. 238\n\nA wise person should never enquire of the universe, \'what is this\', \'what is\nits nature\', \'how was it born\' \'and \'what is its cause\'. He should merely\nthink of it as delusion. (93).\n\nThe wood is forgotten in the elephant made of wood, and the elephant in the\nwood. * So is the supreme self forgotten in the universe and the universe in\nthe self. (94)\n\nOn the vast canvas of the self, the self itself paints the picture of the\nvarious worlds and\n\np. 239\n\nthe supreme-self itself derives extreme bliss from seeing that picture. *\n(95).\n\nThe wise have the firm conviction that there is nothing else than the supreme\nself alone, consisting of pure consciousness, attributeless, imperishable,\nsecondless, of the nature of bliss, and attainable only by direct realisation.\n(96).\n\nThe talk in the Vedas about knowledge and ne-science relates to the stage of\nargumentation. From the true standpoint there is no such distinction, because\nBrahman is the only reality and there is naught else than this. (97).\n\np. 240\n\nIf one asserts that there _is_ anything other than the self, even that is the\nself in its aspect of existence. Anything which is different from being\nexistent, is non-existent and therefore a mere void. (98).\n\nFor the wise, although delusion has been conquered by the steady power of\ntheir knowledge of the self, yet it seems to remain until the death of their\nbodies. But the self shines for them in its real nature. (99)\n\np. 241\n\nThis is the peculiarity of the wise, that, although they are looking at all\nthe variety of phenomenal existence, they could see naught other than the self\nunderstood from all the Vedas. (100).\n\nFor the wise that realise everything to be Brahman, what is there to meditate\nor not meditate, what to speak or not speak, what to do or not do? (101)\n\np. 242\n\nFor the wise that see all objects as the self ( _drik_ ), there is neither\nbondage nor liberation, neither the condition of supreme self nor that of\nindividual soul. (102)\n\nThis is the sole ultimate teaching of all the Vedas if they are repeatedly\nenquired into,--the Vedas which uncontradictably reveal the self and which are\nthe highest authority possible. (103).\n\nThus taught by his master, the disciple saluted his feet with joy and\nmeditated within\n\np. 243\n\nhimself on the truth established by his own direct realisation. (104).\n\nI am undecaying, I am imperishable, I am the Lord ( _pr ajna_), I am the\nconsciousness that is the inner self, I am full of supreme bliss, I am the\nsupreme self ( _parama-siva_ ), I am the infinite. (105).\n\nI am the greatest of those that have realised the self. I am the enjoyer of\nthe realisation of my own bliss. I am he whose glory is realised as "I" by all\nbeings down to children and the illiterate. (106),\n\np. 244\n\nI am averse to sensual pleasures. I am full of the bliss, knowledge and\nrealisation of the self. I am far aloof from any thought of the objective. I\nam delighted at heart by that which is not objective. (107).\n\nI am the Lord of lords. I am devoid of even a touch of jealousy and hatred. I\nam he that fulfils the desired object for those who are bent on realising the\ngoal. (108).\n\np. 245\n\nI alone am the origin of the worlds. I am he that sports in the garden of the\n_upanishads_. I am the flame of the sub-marine fire that will dry up the\noverflowing ocean of sorrow. (109).\n\nI pervade up and down and around with my own extraordinary glories. I am he\nwho appears to be determined by means of argument, counter argument and\nenquiry. (110).\n\np. 246\n\nI am the seer. I am the host of seers. I am the act of creation and I myself\nam the created. I am prosperity, I am progress, I am satisfaction, I am the\nglow of the lamp .of satisfaction. (111).\n\nI am one. I am devoid of all distinctions, such as "this," "like this" or\n"thus". I am he that should be worshipped by the non-desirous. I am devoid of\nthe inner feeling of merit or demerit. (1I2).\n\nI am the revealer of oneness. I alone am the supreme reality for minds\npurified by a\n\np. 247\n\nthorough understanding of the (Vedantic) formula. I am the sun that dispels\nignorance like the darkness of the night. (113).\n\nI am the efficacy of herbs. I am the warp and woof of the worlds. I am the bee\nintoxicated with the fragrance of the bliss of self emanating from the lotus\nof the sacred syllable _om_. (114).\n\nI am the healing balm for evils. I am devoid of all conditional properties. I\nam the acne of liberality. I am he that rescues\n\np. 248\n\nall by (granting) the fourfold desires * in various ways. (115).\n\nI am the goad of all powerfullest elephants, being greater than them. I am as\nspotless as space. I am devoid of emotions generated by the god of love.\n(116).\n\nAmidst doubts and doctrines regarding the self, I am he that is realised by\nunerring instruction. I am averse to transient pleasures. I am fittest for the\nplenitude of eternal bliss and knowledge. (117).\n\np. 249\n\nI am filled with the nectar of mercy. I am he that devours all the worlds\nincluding that of the lotus-seated. * I am devoid of the sinful "I". I am free\nfrom the contagion of sin and virtue. (118).\n\nI am beyond the scope of the senses. I transcend the ether ( _a kasa_). I\npervade phenomenal existence which is (unreal) like a sky-flower. I am\nunattainable by the wicked. I am bent on dispelling imperfect knowledge.\n(119).\n\np. 250\n\nThe very mention of duality will slip away from me. I am he whose dwelling is\nthe innermost heart of all. I am attainable by the contented. I am the perfect\nconsciousness that knows no going or coming. (120).\n\nI am a host of suns for destroying the accumulated darkness of densest\ndelusion. I am the various divisions of time, hour, day, night, year, _yuga_\nand _kalpa_. (121).\n\np. 251\n\nThe sentient and the non-sentient are my forms. My actions are extolled by the\nwisest. I am inaccessible to the unsteady. My abode is the other shore of the\nboisterous ocean of phenomenal existence. (122).\n\nI am elated with the joy of conscious bliss that is hidden down the ocean of\nthe Vedas. I am concealed to those whose minds are fond of deceptive verbiage.\nI am attainable by the way of peace. (123).\n\np. 252\n\nI am the root of all objects from the lotus-seated (Brahman) downwards and of\nthe five great elements. I impart bliss to the worlds. I am free from birth,\nage, disease and death. (124).\n\nI am the several varieties of noise like the buzz, the grunt, the tinkling and\nthe roar. I am he that illuminates the mansion of the heart by the lamp of\nself-realisation promptly lit. (125).\n\nI am knowledge. I am the known. I am the knower. I am all the aids to\nknowledge.\n\np. 253\n\n[paragraph continues] I am that pure sole existence bereft of knower,\nknowledge and known. (126).\n\nMy nature is beyond all principles. I am devoid of the thought that I am among\nthem. I am difficult of attainment for the ignorant. My secret is realisable\nby a knowledge of the words "that" and "thou." (127).\n\nI am the foremost of all deities, demons, fiends, men, animals and mountains.\nI am without body and senses. I am the various directions like south, east,\netc. (128).\n\np. 254\n\nI am of the nature of right and wrong. I am free from the bondage of right and\nwrong etc. I am easily attainable by those that follow the right. I am the\nhappiest. I am the origin of the Creator himself. (129).\n\nI am devoid of names (and forms) etc. I am free from hell, heaven and\nliberation. I am he that is realised by the ultimate inner sound. I am the\nessence of all the Vedas and of the whole universe. (130).\n\np. 255\n\nI am he whose mind is purified by the knowledge of the reality which dispels\nthe distinction between the supreme self and the individual soul. I am the\noriginal. I am the change. I am the fruition of all fortunes. (131).\n\nIn the shape of the serpent, the mountain and the elephant, I bear the whole\nweight of the world. I (am Siva who) destroyed the five-arrowed (Cupid) by the\nfire emanating from the eye in the forehead. (132).\n\np. 256\n\nI never become bound. So, too, I am never liberated from bondage. I am never\nsuch as to be taught. I am not the teaching. I am not the teacher. (133).\n\nI am devotion. I am worship. I am liberation. I alone am the means to\nliberation. I am the ruler of all beings. I am the root-cause of all that is\npast, present and future. (134).\n\nI am respected by the great. I am disrespected by the ignorant. I am difficult\nto attain, owing to the evil tendencies of the mind deluded by pride, desire\nand vanity. (135).\n\np. 257\n\nI am the sacrificial rite, the sacrificer, the priest and the sacrifice. I am\nfree from control of mind etc. * I am Yama, Varuna, Kubera, Indra, Nirriti,\nVayu, \xc3\x8dsvara and Agni. \xe2\x80\xa0 (136).\n\nI are the glory of that playful glance that affords protection and witnesses\nthe control (of the universe.) I am established by the authority of that\nrealisation which springs up amidst conditions wherein there is neither night\nnor day. (137).\n\np. 258\n\nI am the definition and the defined. I am the implied meaning. I am devoid of\ndissolution etc. I am the gain and the loss. I am the unattained amidst the\nattainable. (138).\n\nI have no castes or rules of life. I am the sacred syllables. I am the\nrespected among the most respectable. I am beyond the scope of speech. I am\nwithin the words and the meaning of every sentence. (139).\n\np. 259\n\nI am unattainable even by hundreds of philosophies for minds that are devoid\nof peace and self-control. I am the sole refuge of the wise. I break to pieces\ncountless doubts of various sorts. (140).\n\nI am free from the six states * and the six tastes. \xe2\x80\xa0 I. have no enemy. I am\nfree from the six bodily sheaths. \xe2\x80\xa1 I am beyond the thirty-six principles. \xc2\xa7\n(141).\n\np. 260\n\nI am the bliss of realisation. I am the celestial tree that grants the desire\nfor absorbed contemplation. I am free from phenomenal condition. I am the\ndirect realisation of the Vedanta ( _a tma vidya_). (142)\n\nI am the oblation to the gods and the oblation to the _manes_. I am devoid of\nall ideas of rejection and acceptance. I am Vishnu, I am Siva, I am Brahman\n(the creator), and I alone am their cause. (143)\n\np. 261\n\nAll my sins have been washed away. The sorrows of phenomenal existence have\nbeen dispelled from my heart. I am the root of all the various activities\nexpressed by the letters ending with _ksha_ and beginning with _a_. * (144)\n\nWhy say so much! All this universe, sentient and non-sentient, is myself.\nSpray and foam and wave are not, in reality, substances-different from the\nocean. (145)\n\np. 262\n\nMy refuge is neither my mother, nor father, nor sons, nor brothers, nor\nothers. My supreme refuge shall be the foot placed by my master on my head.\n(146)\n\nThere is the foot of the master. There is unbounded mercy in his look. There\nis whatever he has taught. Is there any higher fulfilment of life? (147)\n\nThe looks of the venerable master are as full as the flood of rays of the\n(full) moon, they\n\np. 263\n\nare a variety of the celestial tree in granting whatever boon is desired, and\nthey soothen and quell the sorrow of the mind. (148)\n\nIn the cave of the heart there lies for ever by herself, the serpent-maid of\npure consciousness, made happy by swallowing the huge frog of a fickle mind.\n(149)\n\nIn the vast ocean of bliss and realisation, which is myself, characterised by\n_m aya_, a thousand universe bubbles spring up and disappear again and again.\n(150)\n\np. 264\n\nSolely by the good ship of the master\'s grace, wafted by the wind of good luck\nacquired in former lives, I have crossed the vast ocean of phenomenal\nexistence, whose waves of sorrow are unendurable. (151)\n\nWhile there was the darkness of ignorance, I saw the whole universe as a\nreality before my eyes. But when the sun of knowledge has risen, I see nothing\nat all. This is wonderful! (152)\n\np. 265\n\nI prostrate not to the gods. One who is beyond all gods does not salute a god.\nAfter that stage, one does no prescribed act. I prostrate again and again to\nmy own self, which is the root of all endeavour. (153)\n\nThus, rejoicing again and again at the thought of his having gained the\nknowledge of the self, he reaches the supreme state of absoluteness (\n_kaivalya_ ), when the fruits of actions ripe for present enjoyment are\n[exhausted](errata.htm#7). (154)\n\np. 266\n\nThe Lord facing the south *, himself, has composed this work entitled "The\ndefinition of one\'s own self", which will dispel the darkness of ignorance and\nwill carry one across the shoreless ocean of phenomenal existence. (155)\n\nThe sky of my mind is illumined by the sun of the master who is the Lord\nVishnu that destroys the darkness of ignorance and causes the lotus of\nrealisation to blossom. (156)\n\nHere Ends\n\nTHE DEFINITION OF ONE\'S OWN SELF.\n\n_________\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[201:*](wos10.htm#fr_176) Difference, duality, manifoldness, variety.\n\n[201:\xe2\x80\xa0](wos10.htm#fr_177) _Avidya_ , ignorance; _asmit a_, egoism; _r aga_,\ndesire; _dvesha_ , hate; and _abhinivesa_ , fear of death.\n\n[203:*](wos10.htm#fr_178) The Supreme Self.\n\n[206:*](wos10.htm#fr_179) _i.e._ , Unreal.\n\n[212:*](wos10.htm#fr_180) Derivation of meaning is of three kinds: exclusive,\ninclusive, and partly exclusive and partly inclusive.\n\n[212:\xe2\x80\xa0](wos10.htm#fr_181) Which really means "the banks of the Ganges"\n\n[213:*](wos10.htm#fr_182) The quality of redness cannot run.
