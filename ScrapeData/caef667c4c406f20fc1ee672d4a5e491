(Or) nine, six, three (years).\n\n3\\. These are the various possibilities.\n\n4\\. Or also one year, according to some (teachers).\n\n5\\. (In this case), however, the observances are enhanced.\n\n6\\. (Keeping the Vrata through one year is allowed only) if (the student\'s)\nancestors have learnt the Mahanamni verses.\n\n7\\. There is also a Brahma _n_ a of the Rauruki ( _S_ akha, in which it is\nsaid):\n\n8\\. \'The mothers forsooth say to their sons, when they suckle them:\n\n9\\. \'"Become men, my little sons, who endeavour to accomplish the _S_ akvari-\nvrata!"\'\n\n10. 10 During (the Vrata preparatory to the study of) these (i.e. the Mahanamni verses), touching water at the time of each Savana (is prescribed).\n\n11\\. Let him not eat in the morning before he has touched water.\n\n12. 12 In the evening, after he has touched water, he should not eat, before he has put the piece of wood on the fire.\n\np. 73\n\n13\\. He should wear dark clothes.\n\n14\\. He should eat dark food.\n\n15\\. Let him be devoted to his teacher.\n\n16\\. Let him make way for nobody.\n\n17\\. He should be addicted to austerities.\n\n18\\. He should stand in day-time.\n\n19\\. He should sit at night.\n\n20\\. And when it is raining, he should not retire to a covered place.\n\n21\\. He should say to (the god) when he sends rain, \'The _S_ akvaris are\nwater.\'\n\n22\\. When (the god) sends lightning, he should say to him, \'Such forsooth is\nthe nature of the _S_ akvaris.\'\n\n23\\. When (the god) thunders, he should say to him, \'The great voice of the\ngreat (cow)!\'\n\n24\\. Let him not cross a river without touching water.\n\n25\\. Let him not ascend a ship.\n\n26\\. If his life is in danger, however, he may ascend (a ship), after having\ntouched water.\n\n27\\. In the same way (he should touch water) having disembarked.\n\n28\\. For in water the virtue of the Mahanamnis is contained.\n\n29\\. If he practises these duties, (the god) Par _g_ anya will send rain\naccording to his wish.\n\n30. 30 The rules about dark (clothes), standing, sitting, (making) way, and (dark) food may be considered as optional.\n\n31\\. After he has kept his vow through one third (of the prescribed time, the\nteacher) should\n\np. 74\n\nsing to him the (first) Stotriya verse (of the Mahanamnis).\n\n32\\. In the same way the two other Stotriya verses (after two-thirds of the\ntime and at the end of the whole time).\n\n33\\. Or all (the three verses) at the end of the whole (time).\n\n34\\. He should sing them to (the student) who has fasted and shuts his eyes.\n\n35. 35 Having filled a brass vessel with water, having thrown into it all sorts of herbs, and dipped (the student\'s) hands into it, the teacher should veil (the student\'s eyes) from left to right with a (new) garment that has not yet been washed.\n\n36. 36 Or he should sing (the Mahanamnis to him) immediately after he has veiled (his eyes).\n\n37. 37 With veiled eyes, keeping silence, he should abstain from food through a period of three nights, or through one day and one night.\n\n38\\. Or he should stand in the forest till sunset (and spend the night in the\nvillage).\n\n39\\. On the next morning he should put wood on the fire in the forest, should\nsacrifice with the Mahavyah _ri_ tis, and should cause the student to look at\n(the following objects, viz.)\n\n40\\. Fire, \xc3\x82 _g_ ya, the sun, a Brahman, a bull, food, water, curds,\n\n41\\. With (the words), \'The sky have I beheld! Light have I beheld!\'\n\np. 75\n\n42\\. In that way all (the objects stated in Sutra 40) three times.\n\n43. 43 After the ceremony for averting evil has been performed, the student respectfully salutes the teacher.\n\n44\\. Thus he has to break the silence (enjoined upon him).\n\n45. 45 A bull, a brass vessel, a garment, an optional gift (of a cow): this is the sacrificial fee.\n\n46\\. The first time he may choose (either a bull or a brass vessel).\n\n47\\. Let him provide his teacher with clothes, according to some (teachers).\n\n48. 48 A mess of cooked food, sacred to Indra, (is prepared). Let him sacrifice of that (food) with this verse, \'To the _Ri_ _k_ , to the Saman we sacrifice\' (Sama-veda I, 369), or (with the verse), \'The lord of the seat, the wonderful\' (ibid. I, 171), or with both (verses).\n\n49. 49 This (he should do) at (all) the Anuprava _k_ aniya ceremonies.\n\np. 76\n\n50. 50 The Mantra has to be altered everywhere (so that he has to say), \'I have kept (the vow),\' \'I have been able,\' \'Thereby I have prospered,\' \'I have undergone.\'\n\n51. 51 The fee to be given after the study of the Parvans is, a goat for the Agni-Parvan, a ram for the Indra-Parvan, a cow for the Pavamana-Parvan.\n\n52\\. After (the student) has returned (from the forest), he should entertain\nhis teacher and his retinue with food,\n\n53\\. And his fellow-students who have come together.\n\n54\\. The way to sing the _G_ yesh _th_ asamans has been explained by (the\nstatements given with regard to) the Mahanamni-(vrata).\n\n55. 55 Here the following standing duties are to be observed:\n\n56\\. He should not have intercourse with a _S_ udra woman.\n\n57\\. He should not eat bird\'s flesh.\n\n58. 58 He should avoid (constantly living on) the same grain, and in the same place, and wearing one garment.\n\n59\\. He should perform the rite of \'touching water\' with water drawn out (of a\npond, &c.).\n\np. 77\n\n60. 60 From (the time of) his being directed (to observe the duties of his Vrata) he should not eat from an earthen vessel,\n\n61\\. Nor drink (from such a vessel),\n\n62. 62 (Or rather) from (the time of) his being taught (the _G_ yesh _th_ asamans, after the whole preparatory time, or after one third of that time), according to some (teachers).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[72:1](sbe30024.htm#fr_266) 2, 1. Regarding the Mahanamni or _S_ akvari verses\nand the observances connected with their study, comp. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana II, 12\n(see especially the note on II, 12, 13) and the sixth Adhyaya of that text.\nKhadira-G _ri_ hya II, 5, 22 seq.\n\n[72:10](sbe30024.htm#fr_267) The rules as to \'touching water\' have been given\nabove, I, 2, 5 seq. The three Savanas or Soma-pressings of which the Soma\nsacrifice consists, are the prata _h_ -savana, the madhyandina-savana, and the\nt _ri_ tiya-savana, i.e. the morning Savana, the midday Savana, and the third\nor evening Savana.\n\n[72:12](sbe30024.htm#fr_268) Comp. above, II, 10, 46; III, I, 27.\n\n[73:30](sbe30024.htm#fr_269) See Sutras 13. 18. 19. 16. 14.\n\n[74:35](sbe30024.htm#fr_270) Comp. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya VI, 3, 7.\n\n[74:36](sbe30024.htm#fr_271) I.e. the fasting prescribed in Sutras 34 and 37\nmay, if they like, follow after the teaching of the sacred song, instead of\npreceding it.\n\n[74:37](sbe30024.htm#fr_272) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya II, 12, 6 seq.\n\n[75:43](sbe30024.htm#fr_273) Comp. above, I, 9, 29; _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana VI, 3, 11\nseq.\n\n[75:45](sbe30024.htm#fr_274) 45, 46. The student is to give a fee to his\nteacher three times, after he has been taught each of the three Stotriya\nverses (Sutras 31. 32). To these three occasions the four objects stated in\nSutra 45 correspond, so that the first time either the first or the second of\nthose objects, the bull or the brass vessel, may be chosen; the second time he\ngives a garment, the third time a vara (or optional gift). Comp. the similar\ncorrespondence of four objects and three cases to which these objects refer,\nII, 10, 8. 52.\n\n[75:48](sbe30024.htm#fr_275) This is the Anuprava _k_ aniya ceremony (or\nceremony to be performed after the study of a Vedic text has been finished)\nbelonging to the Mahanamnis; comp. Khadira-G _ri_ hya II, 5, 34; \xc3\x82 _s_\nvalayana-G _ri_ hya I, 22, 1 2; _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana II, 8, 1 note.\n\n[75:49](sbe30024.htm#fr_276) Perhaps sarvatra (\'everywhere\') belongs to Sutra\n49, so that we should have to translate: This (should be done) everywhere at\np. 76 the Anuprava _k_ aniya ceremonies, i.e. also at those Anuprava _k_ aniya\nceremonies which are connected with the study of the other texts.\n\n[76:50](sbe30024.htm#fr_277) Instead of \'I will keep the vow,\' he says, \'I\nhave kept the vow,\' &c.; II, 10, 16.\n\n[76:51](sbe30024.htm#fr_278) The Parvans are the three great sections, sacred\nto Agni, Indra, and Soma Pavamana, into which the first Samavedar _k_ ika is\ndivided.\n\n[76:55](sbe30024.htm#fr_279) According to the commentary he has to keep these\nobservances through his whole life.\n\n[76:58](sbe30024.htm#fr_280) Or, wearing always the same garment?\n\n[77:60](sbe30024.htm#fr_281) Regarding the directions given to the student by\nthe teacher, see chap. 1, 14.\n\n[77:62](sbe30024.htm#fr_282) See above, Sutras 31. 33.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3](sbe30025.htm)\n\n'
