To attain to the (natural) state of the Universal Ego, by giving up the\ncasual state of the limited Ego, is declared (in the tenth stanza) to be the\nend of this hymn.\n\nThe Ego is, in Himself, one and universal. He becomes many and detached only\nby attachment to the bodies which are many and separate from one another. The\naim of the hymn is to produce, in man, a conviction of this truth and thereby\nto reclaim the Ego from his present separate existence and life.\n\nThe meaning of the tenth stanza may be explained as follows:\n\n2\\. Sons, grandsons, houses, lands, money, grain, all in plenty--these lower\nends, too, accrue in svarga, in patala and on the earth.\n\np. 182\n\nThough the devotee will attain all things of desire by this hymn, yet the wise\nman should not resort to it for attaining such lower ends as these. He should\never aim at the highest object, nothing short of attaining to the state of\nParamesvara Himself. That being achieved, everything else will have been\nattained as a matter of course.\n\n3\\. As cold is warded off from him who is engaged in cooking, so by this hymn\nall gain will accrue to him incidentally.\n\n4\\. Lordliness is in the very nature of Isvara, the Divine Being. It has,\nindeed, no separate existence from Him. Though man may be running, yet his\nshadow accompanies him.\n\np. 183\n\n5\\. Infinite Power is in the nature of Isvara, the Divine Being, and _anim a_\nand the like are only a few drops that trickle down from it. When the devotee\nhas himself become Isvara, they come to him of themselves.\n\n6\\. Atman is none other than Sadasiva, and it is by drops of Atman\'s power\nthat Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva shine so powerful.\n\n7\\. By him who carries a flower, its odour is enjoyed without his seeking for\nBy him who has realised. himself as I. the Universal Ego, the limited powers\n(of Brahma, etc.) are enjoyed.\n\n#### The Eight Siddhis.\n\np. 184\n\n8\\. Anima (smallness), Mahima (vastness), Garima (heaviness), Laghima\n(lightness), Prapti (range of vision), Prakamya (freedom of will), Isitva\n(power to command), Vasitva (power to control)--these are the _eight siddhis_\n(powers).\n\n9\\. The power called _anim a_ (smallness) consists in the all-pervading\nParamatman entering into extremely small creatures as their Atman.\n\n10\\. The power called _mahim a_ (vastness) consists in the group of the\nthirty-six principles, from Brahmanda to Siva, pervading every-where outside.\n\np. 185\n\n11\\. The wise hold that _laghim a_ (lightness) consists in (the Yogin)--whose\nbody is equal to Mahameru--being as light as cotton when being lifted up.\n\n12\\. The wise hold that _garim a_ (heaviness) consists in (the Yogin)--whose\nbody is as small as an atom--being as heavy as Meru when being lifted up.\n\n13\\. The power called _pr ajpti_ (range of vision) consists in a person who\nlives in Patala seeing the Brahmaloka; and it is very hard to attain for those\nwho are not Yogins.\n\n14\\. The attaining, by one\'s own mere will, of power to journey through the\n\np. 186\n\nsky and of other such powers is called _pr akamya_ (freedom of will).\n\n15\\. Some declare that there is a power called _pv akas\'ya_ (luminosity), in\nvirtue of which all things shine in the light of the Yogin\'s own body.\n\n16\\. The power to cause, by mere will, a creation of one\'s own, its\ncontinuance, and dissolution, and to command the sun and the like is called\n_Isitva_ (supremacy).\n\n17\\. _Vasitva_ (the power of controlling) consists in having all the worlds as\nwell as the lords of those worlds under one\'s\n\np. 187\n\nown control; and it is easy for Siva-Yogins to acquire that power.\n\n#### Glory of the Divine Contemplation\n\n18\\. Devas are under the control of that Brahmana who contemplates as above:\nwhat need is there to say that princes, tigers, snakes, women, men, and the\nlike (are subject to his control)?\n\n19\\. To those in whose minds the conviction as to their being one with the\nUniversal Ego holds an unintermittent sway, to those who are perfect in\nsamadhi, what is there which cannot be attained?\n\n20, The wise man should recite this hymn and contemplate on the idea that\n\np. 188\n\nhe is the Self in all, abandoning all yearning for the lesser fruits arising\nfrom svarga and so on.\n\n21\\. No wise man, indeed, ever looks upon the kingdom of svarga as a great\nempire. That alone is his empire, namely, the identity of his Self with the\nSupreme Being.\n\n22\\. All siddhis (powers) come to him who ever contemplates the Self in all.\nWherefore, with the mind controlled, one should hold his empire in the Atman.\n\n#### Love of God and Guru essential for wisdom.\n\n23\\. "Who so hath highest love for God, and for the Guru as for God, to that\n\np. 189\n\n[paragraph continues] Mahatman the truths here taught shine in full."\n\n24\\. He Who, by His power of light, affords light to all lights, Who lights\nthe whole universe, may that Light shine full in His light!\n\n25\\. Thus ends the tenth chapter in brief in the work called Manasollasa,\nwhich expounds the meaning of the Hymn to the Blessed Dakshinamurti.\n\n\n\n_Om Tat Sat_.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pranava-Vartika](dast15.htm)\n\n'
