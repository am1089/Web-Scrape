A householder must perform the Pakaya _g_ \xc3\xb1as[1]\n\n[11. 1 Nand. interprets the term par _s_ vika by \'moving a chowrie to and fro\nbefore one\'s master, while standing by his side.\'\n\nLIX. 1.

III, 77, 78, 80, 81.\n\n1\\. 1 The term Pakaya _g_ \xc3\xb1a is used in a more restricted sense here than\nabove (LV, 20). Nand. interprets it by \'Vai _s_ vadeva, {footnote p. 191}\nSthalipaka, Srav _n_ akarmen, and similar sacrifices,\' i. e. all the\nsacrifices which have to be performed in the one household fire, as opposed to\nthose for which a Treta or triad of sacred fires is required (see Stenzler,\nnote on \xc3\x82 _s_ v. I, 1, 2). Gautama (VIII, 18) enumerates seven Pakaya _g_ \xc3\xb1as,\namong which, however, the Vai _s_ vadeva is not included. The Vai _s_ vadeva\nis described in LXVII. Regarding the other Pakaya _g_ \xc3\xb1as, see the G _ri_ hya-\nsutras.--2 \'Or in the fire kindled at the division of the family estate, or in\nthe fire kindled on his becoming master of the house.\' (Nand.) See Sa _n_ kh.\nI, 1, 3-5.]\n\np. 191\n\n(small or domestic offerings) in the fire kindled at the time of marriage[2].\n\n2\\. He must offer the Agnihotra (or daily oblations of clarified butter) every\nmorning and evening (in the Treta fires).\n\n3\\. He must offer burnt-oblations to the gods (in case the Agnihotra cannot be\nperformed).\n\n4\\. Let him offer the two Dar _s_ apur _n_ amasas on the days of conjunction\nand opposition of the sun\n\nand moon.\n\n5\\. Once in each half of the year, (at the two solstices, let him offer) the\nPa _s_ ubandha (animal sacrifice).\n\n6\\. In autumn and summer let him offer the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a (oblation of first-\nfruits);\n\n[2. The three Treta fires have been enumerated above (XXXI, 8). Regarding the\nAgnihotra and the sacrifices mentioned in 4-8, see Weber, Ind. Stud. X,\n328-337, 343-349, 352-396.\n\n4\\. \'One who has performed the ceremony of Agnyadhana (kindling the sacred\nfires) must perform these two offerings in the Treta fires, one who has not\ndone so, in the household or nuptial fire.\' (Nand.) This remark applies\nequally to the sacrifices mentioned in 5-7.\n\n6\\. \'If the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a is offered in the household fire, it must consist of\na Sthalipaka (cooked offering of grain).\' (Nand.) See the G _ri_ hya-sutras\nabove cited. Nand. further explains that in autumn the first-fruits of rice,\nand in summer the firstlings of {footnote p. 192} barley, or, according to\n\xc3\x82pastamba, of Ve _n_ uyava, have to be offered, and he infers from another\ntext of the same author that the particle _k_ a here refers to an oblation of\nSyamaka grain, which has to be offered in the rainy season. The two passages\nin question are not found in \xc3\x82pastamba\'s Dharma-sutra, but Weber, loc. cit.,\nquotes them from Katyayana.]\n\np. 192\n\n7\\. Or when rice and barley are ripening (in winter and spring).\n\n8\\. He who has a sufficient supply of food for more than three years (shall\nperform the Soma-sacrifice)[1].\n\n9\\. (He shall perform) the Soma-sacrifice once a year (in spring).\n\n10\\. If he has not wealth (sufficient to defray the expenses of the Pa _s_\nubandha, Soma, _K_ aturmasya, and other _S_ rauta sacrifices), he shall\nperform the Ish _t_ i Vaisvanari.\n\n11\\. Let him not make an offering of food obtained as alms from a _S_ udra.\n\n12\\. If he has begged articles for a sacrifice (and obtained them), let him\nemploy them all for that purpose (and never for himself).\n\n13\\. Every evening and morning let him offer up the Vai _s_ vadeva;\n\n14\\. And[1] let him give alms to an Ascetic (afterwards).\n\n15\\. For giving alms and showing due honour to the recipient (by pouring water\non his hands both before and afterwards) he obtains the same reward as for\ngiving a cow.\n\n[8. 1 According to Nand., the Soma-sacrifices here referred to are of the\nkamya species (offered in order to obtain the gratification of a special\ndesire).\n\n14\\. 1 Nand. infers from the use of the particle _k_ a, and from a text of\nPara _s_ ara, that an injunction to give alms to a student is also intended\nhere.]\n\np. 193\n\n16\\. If there is no ascetic (or other person worthy to receive alms), he must\ngive a mouthful to cows;\n\n17\\. Or he must cast it into fire.\n\n18\\. If there is food in the house, he must not reject a mendicant, (who\narrives) after he has taken his meal himself.\n\n19\\. A householder has five places where animals are liable to be destroyed:\nhis wooden mortar, his slab to grind wheat or condiments upon, his fireplace,\nhis water-pot, and his broom.\n\n20\\. For the sake of expiating offences committed (by ignorantly destroying\nlife) in those places, he must perform the (five) sacrifices addressed to the\nVeda, to the gods, to all created beings (or \'to the goblins\'), to the manes,\nand to men.\n\n21\\. Privately reciting (and teaching) the Veda is the sacrifice addressed to\nthe Veda.\n\n22\\. The regular burnt-oblation (Vaisvadeva) is the sacrifice addressed to the\ngods.\n\n23\\. The Pit _ri_ tarpana (refreshing the manes with food and water) is the\nsacrifice addressed to the manes.\n\n24\\. The Bali-offering is the sacrifice addressed to all creatures (or \'to the\ngoblins\').\n\n25\\. The sacrifice addressed to men consists in honouring a guest.\n\n26\\. He who does not give their share to these five, the gods, his guests,\n(his wife and children and others,) whom he is bound to maintain, his manes,\nand himself, is not alive, though he breathes.\n\n[18. \'The expression, "if there is food in the house," indicates that he is\nnot bound to cook a fresh meal for his guest.\' (Nand.)]\n\np. 194\n\n27\\. These (three), the student, the hermit, and the ascetic, derive their\nexistence from the order of householders; therefore must a householder not\ntreat them with disdain, when they have arrived (at his house at the proper\ntime for begging alms).\n\n28\\. The householder offers sacrifices, the householder practises austerities,\nthe householder distributes gifts; therefore is the order of householders, the\nfirst of all.\n\n29\\. The _Ri_ shis[1], the manes, the gods, all creatures (dogs, &c.), and\nguests beg householders for support; therefore is the order of householders\nthe best of all.\n\n30\\. If a householder is intent upon pursuing the three objects of life\n(virtue, love, and wealth), upon constantly distributing presents of food,\nupon worshipping the gods, upon honouring the Brahma _n_ as, upon discharging\nhis duty of privately reciting (and teaching) the Veda, and upon refreshing\nthe manes (with oblations of balls of rice, water, and the like), he will\nattain the world of Indra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: LX.](sbe07062.htm)\n\n'
