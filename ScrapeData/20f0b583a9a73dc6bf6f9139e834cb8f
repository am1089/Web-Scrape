Vyasa said :-- O King! When there was going on in the King\xc2\x92s palace, the\ngrand festivities for the son\xc2\x92s birth ceremonies, Varu _n_ a Deva came there\nin the holy Brahmi _n_ form. \xc2\x93Let welfare be on you.\xc2\x94 Saying this, Varu _n_ a\nbegan to say :-- \xc2\x93O King! Know me to he Varu _n_ a. Now hear what I say. O\nKing! Your son is now born; therefore perform sacrifices in honor to me with\nyour son. O King! Your defect of not having a son is now removed; so fulfil\nwhat you promised before.\xc2\x94 Hearing these words, the King began to think \xc2\x93Oh!\nOnly one lotus-faced son is born to me; how can I kill it. On the other hand,\nthe powerful Regent (Lokapala) of one quarter is present in Brahma _n_ a form;\nand it never behoves one to show disrespect to a Deva or to a man who wishes\nwelfare to us. Again it is very difficult to root out the affection for a son;\nso what am I to do now? How shall I preserve my happiness due to the birth of\nmy son.\xc2\x94 The King, then, with patience bowed down to him and worshipped him\nduly and humbly spoke to him in beautiful words, pregnant with reason.\n\n\n\n8-10. O Deva of the Devas! I will obey your order no doubt and I will perform\nyour sacrifice according to the Vedic rites and with profuse Dak _s_ i _n_ as\n(remuneration to priests, etc.) But, when in a sacrifice human beings are\nimmolated as victims, both the husband and wife are entitled to the ceremony.\nFather becomes purified on the tenth day and mother on the expiration of one\nmonth after the son\xc2\x92s birth; so how can I perform the sacrifice until one\nmonth expires! You are omniscient and the master of all the beings; and you\nknow what is Nitya Dharma. So, O Varu _n_ a Deva! I want one month time; and\nshow mercy thus on me.\n\n\n\n11-19. Vyasa said :-- O King! The King Haris\xc2\x92chandra saying thus, Varu _n_ a\nDeva spoke to the King :-- \xc2\x93O King! Welfare be unto\n\n\n\np. 644\n\n\n\nyou! Do your duties; I am now going back to my place. O King! I will come\nagain after one month. Better finish the natal ceremonies and the Namakara _n_\na ceremony regularly and then perform my sacrifice.\xc2\x94 O King! When Varu _n_ a\nDeva turned his back, the King began to feel happiness. Then the King gave as\ngifts millions of cows, yielding plenty of milk and ornamented with gold, and\nmountains of Til, sesamums to the Brahmi _n_ s versed in the Vedas and kept\nhis name, with formal ceremonies as Rohitas\xc2\x92va. When one month became\ncomplete, Varu _n_ a Deva came again in a Brahmi _n_ form and frequently said\n:-- \xc2\x93O King! Start the sacrifice just now!\xc2\x94 The King, on seeing the God of\nWaters, at once fell into an ocean of anxieties and sorrows; he then bowed\ndown and worshipping him as a guest, spoke to him with folded palms :-- \xc2\x93O\nDeva! It is to my great fortune that you have landed your feet at my place; O\nLord! My house has been sanctified to day. O Deva! I will do, no doubt, your\ndesired sacrifice according to the rites and ceremonies. But see, the victims\nthat have not their teeth come as yet are not fit for a sacrifice; so the\nversed Pundits say; so I have settled I would perform your great sacrifice, as\ndesired by you, when the teeth will come out of my son.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n20-41. Vyasa said :-- O Lord of men! Hearing thus, Varu _n_ a spoke \xc2\x93Let it be\nso\xc2\x94 and went away. The King Haris\xc2\x92chandra became glad and passed his days in\nenjoyments in his household. When the teeth of the child got out, Varu _n_ a\nknew it and came again in a Brahmi _n_ garb in the palace and spoke \xc2\x93O King!\nNow commence my sacrifice.\xc2\x94 Seeing the Brahmi _n_ Varu _n_ a there, the King,\ntoo, bowed down and gave him a seat and shewing all respects to him,\nworshipped him. He sang hymns to him and very humbly said with his head bent\nlow :-- \xc2\x93O Deva! I will perform your desired sacrifice with plenty of Dak _s_\n\xc2\x92i _n_ as according to rites and ceremonies. But the child\xc2\x92s Chu _d_ akara _n_\na (the ceremony of tonsure) is not yet done; so the hairs that were at the\nbirth time are still there and the child cannot be fit for sacrifice as long\nas those hairs exist. So I have heard from the elderly persons. O Lord of\nWaters! You know the S\xc2\x92astric rules; kindly wait till the Chu _d_ akara _n_ a\nis over. When the child will have his head shaven, I will certainly perform\nyour sacrifice; there is no doubt in this.\xc2\x94 Hearing these words, Varu _n_ a\nspoke to him again :-- \xc2\x93O King! Why are you deceiving me like this so often? O\nKing! Now you have all the materials ready for the sacrifice; only for your\nfilial affection you are deceiving me. However, if, after the ceremony of\ntonsure, you do not perform my sacrifice, I will be angry and I will curse\nyou. O King! I am going for the present; but see do not tell lies, being born\nin the family of Ik _s_ aku.\xc2\x94 Instantly Varu _n_ a\n\n\n\np. 645\n\n\n\ndisappeared; the King, too, felt himself happy in his household. When the\nceremony of tonsure was commenced and grand festivities were held, on the\noccasion Varu _n_ a soon came again to the King\xc2\x92s palace. The queen was then\nsitting before the King with the child in her lap when Varu _n_ a came up\nthere. The Brahmi _n_ Varu _n_ a then appeared like a Flaming Fire and spoke\nto the King in a clear voice :-- \xc2\x93O King! Start the sacrifice.\xc2\x94 Seeing him,\nthe King was confused with terror and with folded palms, quickly bowed down to\nhim. After worshipping him duly, he very humbly said :-- \xc2\x93O Lord! Today I will\nperform your sacrifice. But kindly hear with attention my saying and then do\nwhat is advisable. O Lord! If you approve of this as reasonable, I then open\nmy heart to you. The three Var _n_ as Brahma _n_ as, K _s_ attriyas, and\nVais\xc2\x92yas become Dvijas (twice-born) only when they are duly purified according\nto proper rules and ceremonies; without any such purifications they are\ncertainly S\xc2\x92udras. So the Pundits versed in the Vedas declare. My child is now\nan infant only; so it is like a S\xc2\x92udra. When his thread ceremony (Upanayan)\nwill be performed, he will then be fit for the sacrifice; this the Veda\nS\xc2\x92astras declare. The K _s_ atttriyas are so purified in their eleventh year;\nthe Brahma _n_ as in their eighth year and the Vais\xc2\x92yas in their twelfth year.\nSo, O Lord of the Devas! If you feel pity for your this humble servant, then\nwait till the Upanayana ceremony is over, when I will perform your grand\nsacrifice with my son. O Bibhu! You are the Lokapala; specially you are\nconversant with all the S\xc2\x92astric rules and have acquired the knowledge of\nDharma. If you think my saying as true, then go to your home.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n42-51. Vyasa said :-- Hearing these words, Varu _n_ a\xc2\x92s heart was filled with\npity and so he went away instantly, saying \xc2\x93Let it be so.\xc2\x94 Varu _n_ a going\naway, the King felt very glad and the queen, knowing the welfare of the son\nbecame glad too. Then the King gladly performed his state duties. After some\ntime, the child grew ten years old. Consulting with the peaceful Brahma _n_ as\nas well as his ministers, he collected materials for the Upanayana ceremony\nbefitting his position. When the eleventh year was completed by his son, the\nKing arranged everything for the thread ceremony but when his thoughts turned\nto Varu _n_ a\xc2\x92s sacrifice, he became very sad and anxious. When the thread\nceremony began to be performed, the Brahmi _n_ Varu _n_ a came there. Seeing\nhim, the King instantly bowed down and standing before him with clasped palms,\ngladly spoke to him :-- O Deva! My son\xc2\x92s Upanayana being over, now my son is\nfit for the victim in the sacrifice; and by your grace, my sorrow that was\nwithin me as not having a son, has vanished. I speak truly before\n\n\n\np. 646\n\n\n\nyou that, O Knower of Virtue! after some mere time I have desired to perform\nyour sacrifice with plenty of Dak _s_ i _n_ as. In fact, when the Samavartan\nceremony will be over, I will do as you like. Kindly wait till then.\n\n\n\n52-62. Varu _n_ a said :-- O Intelligent One! You are very much attached to\nyour son now and so by various reasonable plays of intellect, you are\nrepeatedly deceiving me. However, I am going home today at your request but\nknow certain that I will come again at the time of the Samavartan ceremony.\n(N. B.:-- Samavartan means the return home especially of a pupil from his\ntutor\xc2\x92s house after finishing his course of study there.) O King! Thus saying,\nVaru _n_ a went away and the King became glad and began to perform duly his\nvarious duties. The prince was very intelligent; and as he used to see Varu\n_n_ a coming, now and then, at the time of the ceremonies, he became very\nanxious. He then made enquiries outside hither and thither and came to know of\nhis own being about to be killed and he desired to quit the house instantly.\nHe then consulted with the minister\xc2\x92s sons and came to a final conclusion and\nwent out of the city to the forest. When the son had gone to the forest, the\nKing became very much afflicted with sorrow and sent messengers in quest of\nhim. When some time passed away, Varu _n_ a came to his house and spoke to the\ndistressed King :-- \xc2\x93O King! Now perform your desired Sacrifice.\xc2\x94 The King\nbowed down to him and said :-- \xc2\x93O Deva! What shall I do now? My son has become\nafraid and has gone away. I do not know where he has gone. O Deva! My\nmessengers have searched for him in difficult places in mountains, in the\nhermitages of the Munis, in fact, in all the places; but they have not been\nable to find him out anywhere. My son has left his home; order now what I can\ndo. O Deva! You know everything; so judge I have got no fault in this matter.\nIt is certainly luck and nothing else.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n63-66. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing these words of the King, Varu _n_ a\nbecame very much angry and when he saw that he was deceived so many times by\nthe King, he then cursed, saying :-- \xc2\x93O King! As you have cheated me by your\ndeceitful words, so you be attacked by dropsy and be severely pained by it.\xc2\x94\nThus cursed by Varu _n_ a, the King was attacked with that disease and began\nto suffer much. Cursing thus, Varu _n_ a went back to his own place and the\nKing was much afflicted with that terrible disease.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fifteenth Chapter in the Seventh Book on the story of the King\nHaris\xc2\x92chandra in the Mahapura _n_ am S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses\nby Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 16](bk07ch16.htm)\n\n"
