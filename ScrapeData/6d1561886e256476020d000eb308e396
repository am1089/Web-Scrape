They now take the Nir _ri_ ti (bricks) from there. For, having\nbuilt the Garhapatya, the gods then ascended it,--the Garhapatya being this\n(earth-) world, it is this world they ascended after completing it. They saw\nnothing but darkness not to be seen through.\n\n7:2:1:22\\. They said, 'Think ye upon this, how we may dispel that darkness,\nevil!' They said, 'Meditate ye ( _k_ etay)!'--whereby indeed they said, 'Seek\nye to build an altar (kitim)!'--'Seek ye so that we may dispel that darkness,\nevil!'\n\n7:2:1:33\\. Whilst meditating, they saw those Nir _ri_ ti bricks; they piled\nthem up, and by them dispelled that darkness, evil; for Nir _ri_ ti\n(corruption, or destruction) is evil; and inasmuch as by them they dispelled\nNir _ri_ ti, evil, these are Nir _ri_ ti's (bricks).\n\n7:2:1:44\\. Now that same thing which the gods did, is done here: even now that\ndarkness, that evil, has indeed been dispelled by the gods themselves; but\nwhen he now does this, it is because he thinks, 'I must do what the gods did.'\nAnd, besides, he removes, by means of these (bricks), whatever evil, whatever\ncorruption there is; and because he removes by them evil, corruption (nir _ri_\nti), therefore these are Nir _ri_ ti's (bricks).\n\n7:2:1:55\\. And, again, why they take these (bricks) of Nir _ri_ ti;--when the\ngods restored the relaxed Pra _g_ apati, they cast him as seed into the fire-\npan, the\n\np. 320\n\nwomb; the fire-pan being indeed a womb. In the course of a year they prepared\nfor him this foundation, even this (terrestrial) world; the Garhapatya\n(hearth) being this world: therein they generated him. And whatever evil there\nwas in him, whatever mucus, whatever inner and outer membrane, that they\nremoved from him by means of these (bricks); and inasmuch as thereby they\nremoved his evil, his corruption, these are Nir _ri_ ti's (bricks).\n\n7:2:1:66\\. In like manner the Sacrificer now casts his own self 1, as seed,\ninto the fire-pan, the womb; the fire-pan being indeed a womb. In the course\nof a year he prepares for that (self of his) this foundation, even this\n(terrestrial) world; the Garhapatya being this world: therein he generates it.\nAnd whatever evil there is of it, whatever mucus, whatever inner and outer\nmembrane, that he removes therefrom by these (bricks); and inasmuch as he\nthereby removes its evil, its corruption, these are Nir _ri_ ti's (bricks).\n\n7:2:1:77\\. They measure a foot (square): he thus treads evil, corruption,\nunder foot. They are unmarked; for whatever is not, that is unmarked (by\ncharacteristics): he thus makes evil, corruption to be non-existent. They get\nbaked by (rice) husks, for husks belong to Nir _ri_ ti: by Nir _ri_ ti's own\n(objects) he thus performs Nir _ri_ ti's rite. They are black, for black was\nthat darkness; and black in truth is Nir _ri_ ti (corruption).\n\n7:2:1:88\\. With them they proceed towards that (southwestern) quarter, for\nthat is Nir _ri_ ti's quarter: he thus places Nir _ri_ ti (corruption) in Nir\n_ri_ ti's quarter.\n\np. 321\n\n[paragraph continues] And anywhere where there is a self-produced hollow 1 or\ncleft in the ground, he lays down those (bricks); for on whatever part of this\n(earth) there is a cleaving, or in whatever part of it plants are not\nproduced, verily that part of it Nir _ri_ ti seizes upon: he thus places\ncorruption in a (part) of the earth set aside for Nir _ri_ ti. Having put them\nin their places in a direction away from himself 2, he lays them down 3.\n\n7:2:1:99\\. [He lays them down, with Va _g_. S. XII, 62-64] 'Seek thou him that\noffereth not Soma, nor other offering!' him who neither presses Soma nor makes\noffering Nir _ri_ ti indeed visits;--'Of the thief do thou follow the way, of\nthe robber!' that is, 'follow the way both of the thief and the robber, and\neven as a thief or a robber remains concealed, so do thou remain\nconcealed!'--'Seek thou some one other than us: this is thy way;' that is,\n'seek him who is ignorant of this (sacred work);'--'Homage be to thee, O\ndivine Nir _ri_ ti!' he thus turns Nir _ri_ ti aside by rendering homage to\nher.\n\n7:2:1:1010\\. 'Homage be unto thee full well, O sharp-edged Nir _ri_ ti!' for\nNir _ri_ ti is indeed sharp-edged: to her he thereby renders homage;--'loose\nthou\n\np. 322\n\nthis iron bond!' for it is indeed with an iron bond that Nir _ri_ ti binds him\nwhom she binds;--'being of one mind with Yama and Yami,'--Yama doubtless is\nAgni, and Yam is this (earth), and by these two everything here is kept in\ncheck: thus, 'being of one mind with those two,'--'raise him unto the highest\nfirmament!' the firmament is the heavenly world: thus, 'raise the Sacrificer\nup to the heavenly world!'\n\n7:2:1:1111\\. 'Thee, O awful (goddess), into whose mouth I offer--' Nir _ri_ ti\nis indeed awful, and into her mouth he now offers when he performs this divine\nrite;--'for the unloosing of these bonds;' that is, of those bonds with which\nhe has been bound;--'Thee whom people rejoice in calling Earth,'--the Earth is\nthis (world), and he who exists, exists thereon,--'but I know thee to be Nir\n_ri_ ti everywhere!' that is, in every respect I know that thou art Nir _ri_\nti. Now Nir _ri_ ti is this earth, and this earth makes him decay who becomes\ncorrupted: in speaking thus, it is as if he were to say, 'Thou art So and So,\nthe son of So and So, I know thee, do not injure me!' for in no wise does he\nwho is known injure one when spoken to.\n\n7:2:1:1212\\. He does not touch (the bricks),--Nir _ri_ ti being evil,--lest he\nput himself in contact with evil. He does not 'settle' them,--settlement being\na firm footing--lest he give a firm footing to evil. He does not pronounce the\nSudadohas verse upon them,--the Sudadohas being the vital air,--lest he should\njoin Nir _ri_ ti (corruption) together, and restore her.\n\n7:2:1:1313\\. Now some lay (the bricks) down from the farther end towards\nthemselves,--Nir _ri_ ti (corruption) being evil,--lest they themselves should\ngo the way\n\np. 323\n\nto corruption. Let him not do so, but let him lay them down in the direction\naway from him: he thus drives evil, corruption, away from him.\n\n7:2:1:1414\\. Three bricks he lays down,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni\nis, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus repels evil, corruption.\n\n7:2:1:1515\\. The seat, the netting, the sling of the gold plate, and the two\npads he throws down on the farther side (of the bricks),--the sling 1 is\nsacred to Nir _ri_ ti: from Nir _ri_ ti's sling he is thus freed. [He throws\nthem down, with Va _g_. S. XII, 65] 'The indissoluble bond which the divine\nNir _ri_ ti hath fastened upon thy neck,'--indissoluble indeed for him who\ndoes not know this;--'that (bond) of thine I unloose, as from the middle of\n\xc3\x82yus,'--\xc3\x82yus 2 doubtless is Agni, and his middle (body) is that Garhapatya\nwhich has been built;--not yet built is the \xc3\x82havaniya: hence whether a youth\nbuilds the altar, or an old man, he says 'as from the middle of \xc3\x82yus;'--'now,\nbeing urged forward, eat thou this nourishment!' nourishment means food: thus,\n'now, set free, eat thou this food.' With Trish _t_ ubh verses (he performs\nthis rite), for the Trish _t_ ubh is a thunderbolt: it is thus with a\nthunderbolt that he repels evil, corruption.\n\n7:2:1:1616\\. There are three bricks, the seat, the netting, the sling of the\ngold plate, and the two pads; that makes eight;--the Gayatri consists of eight\nsyllables,\n\np. 324\n\nand Agni is Gayatra: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so\nmuch he thus repels evil, corruption.\n\n7:2:1:1717\\. On the space between (the Sacrificer and the bricks) he pours out\na jarful of water,--water is a thunderbolt: with a thunderbolt he thus\nseparates from himself evil, corruption. With 'Homage to (the goddess of)\nProsperity who hath done this!' they rise, for it was with a view to\nprosperity that the gods at first performed this rite, and to that (goddess)\nthey then rendered homage; and for prosperity indeed this (Sacrificer) now\nperforms this rite, and to that (goddess) he now renders homage. They go back\n(to the sacrificial ground) without looking back: they thus abandon evil,\ncorruption, even without looking back to it.\n\n7:2:1:1818\\. Having returned, he stands worshipping by the fire; for when he\ngoes into that (south-western) direction whilst Agni is only half built up, he\ndoes what is improper: he now makes amends to him to prevent his doing any\nharm.\n\n7:2:1:1919\\. And again, why he stands by (the fire). The Garhapatya (hearth)\nis this (terrestrial) world; for the Garhapatya is a foundation, and the\nfoundation doubtless is this (earth). Now when he goes into that direction, he\ngoes where there is no path; and when he stands by (the fire), he thereby\nreturns to this (earth), the foundation, and establishes himself upon this\nfoundation.\n\n7:2:1:2020\\. [He worships, with Va _g_. S. XII, 66] 'The harbourer and\ngatherer of riches,' for a harbourer this world indeed is, a gatherer of\nriches;--'all form he watches over with his favours,'--that is, 'all forms (of\nbeing) he watches over with\n\np. 325\n\nhis favours;'--'like the god Savit _ri_ , like Indra, he of true covenant\nstood at the meeting of ways 1;' as the text, so its meaning.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[320:1](sbe4157.htm#fr_610) Or (Pra _g_ apati's), Agni's self, or body.\n\n[321:1](sbe4157.htm#fr_611) Or probably, a barren spot, see [p.\n43](sbe4110.htm#page_43), note [2](sbe4110.htm#fn_101).\n\n[321:2](sbe4157.htm#fr_612) That is, whilst himself remaining north of the\nplace, and facing the south, he puts them down in the direction from north to\nsouth.\n\n[321:3](sbe4157.htm#fr_613) That is, he performs the formal ceremony of\n'laying down (upadhana)' whilst muttering the respective verses. In the\npresent case the 'laying down' of the bricks is to be performed by him whilst\nmuttering the formulas, but without touching the bricks themselves. The\ndirection that the bricks are to be deposited in a direction 'away from him'\nperhaps refers to the 'laying down' instead of to the actual placing them.\n\n[323:1](sbe4157.htm#fr_614) According to Saya _n_ a the sling of the gold\nplate is here singled out, because the other objects have necessarily been\ndamaged by the hot fire-pan and are consequently thrown away as a matter of\ncourse.\n\n[323:2](sbe4157.htm#fr_615) See III, 4, 1, 22. In the formula 'ayus' may\nrather have to be taken in the sense of 'life,' or 'vital power.' Mahidhara\ntakes 'na' in the sense of 'now (samprati),' instead of 'as.'\n\n[325:1](sbe4157.htm#fr_616) Mahidhara takes 'samare pathinam' in the sense of\n'in the battle of (i.e. with) the waylayers (paripanthibhi _h_ saha).'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII, 2, 2.
