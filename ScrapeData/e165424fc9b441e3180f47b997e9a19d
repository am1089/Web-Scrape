And on account of the momentariness (of the alayavi _g \xc3\xb1_ana, it cannot\nbe the abode of mental impressions).\n\nIf you maintain that the so-called internal cognition (alayavi _g \xc3\xb1_ana 1)\nassumed by you may constitute the abode\n\np. 427\n\nof the mental impressions, we deny that, because that cognition also being\nadmittedly momentary, and hence non-permanent, cannot be the abode of\nimpressions any more than the quasi-external cognitions (prav _ri_ tti-vi _g\n\xc3\xb1_ana). For unless there exists one continuous principle equally connected\nwith the past, the present, and the future  1, or an absolutely unchangeable\n(Self) which cognises everything, we are unable to account for remembrance,\nrecognition, and so on, which are subject to mental impressions dependent on\nplace, time, and cause. If, on the other hand, you declare your alayavi _g\n\xc3\xb1_ana to be something permanent, you thereby abandon your tenet of the alayavi\n_g \xc3\xb1_ana as well as everything else being momentary.--Or (to explain the Sutra\nin a different way) as the tenet of general momentariness is characteristic of\nthe systems of the idealistic as well as the realistic Bauddhas, we may bring\nforward against the doctrines of the former all those arguments dependent on\nthe principle of general momentariness which we have above urged against the\nlatter.\n\nWe have thus refuted both nihilistic doctrines, viz. the doctrine which\nmaintains the (momentary) reality of the external world, and the doctrine\nwhich asserts that ideas only exist. The third variety of Bauddha doctrine,\nviz. that everything is empty (i. e. that absolutely nothing exists), is\ncontradicted by all means of right knowledge, and therefore requires no\nspecial refutation. For this apparent world, whose existence is guaranteed by\nall the means of knowledge, cannot be denied, unless some one should find out\nsome new truth (based on which he could impugn its existence)--for a general\nprinciple is proved by the absence of contrary instances.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[426:1](sbe34207.htm#fr_414) The vi _g \xc3\xb1_anaskandha comprises vi _g \xc3\xb1_anas of\ntwo different kinds, the alayavi _g \xc3\xb1_ana and the prav _ri_ ttivi _g \xc3\xb1_ana.\nThe alayavi _g \xc3\xb1_ana comprises the series of cognitions or ideas which refer\nto the ego; the prav _ri_ ttivi _g \xc3\xb1_ana comprises those ideas which refer to\napparently external objects, such as colour and the like. The ideas of the p.\n427 latter class are due to the mental impressions left by the antecedent\nideas of the former class.\n\n[427:1](sbe34207.htm#fr_415) Viz. in the present case the principle that what\npresents itself to consciousness is not non-existent.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 32](sbe34208.htm)\n\n'
