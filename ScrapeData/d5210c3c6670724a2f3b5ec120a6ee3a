Now there is one animal sacrifice of the Havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a order\n3, and another of the order of the Soma-sacrifice. Of the Havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a\norder is that at which he (the Adhvaryu) brings him fast-food 4, leads water\n\np. 120\n\nforward 1, and pours out a jarful of water 2, and at which (the Sacrificer)\nstrides the Vish _n_ u-strides 3; and of the order of the Soma-sacrifice is\nthat (animal sacrifice) at which these (rites) are not performed.\n\n11:7:2:22\\. Concerning this they ask, 'Is the animal sacrifice an ish _t_ i or\na great (Soma-) sacrifice?'--'A great sacrifice,' let him say; 'for in that\n(other) case 4 thou hast made the animal sacrifice an ish _t_ i, and shattered\nit.' Thus he should say to him.\n\n11:7:2:33\\. Its fore-offerings are the morning-service 5, its after-offerings\nthe evening-service, and its sacrificial cake 6 the midday-service.\n\n11:7:2:44\\. Now, some bring up the Dakshi _n_ as (presents to the priests)\nwhen the omentum has been offered 7;\n\np. 121\n\nbut let him not do so, for if, in that case, any one were to say of him,\n'Surely, this (Sacrificer) has brought the Dakshi _n_ as outside of the vital\nairs (or, of life), he has not strengthened his vital airs: he will become\neither blind, or lame, or deaf, or paralyzed on one side;' then that would\nindeed he likely to come to pass.\n\n11:7:2:55\\. Let him perform it in this way:--when the I _d_ a of the cake-\noffering has been invoked, he should bring up the Dakshi _n_ as; for to Indra\nbelongs this vital air in the centre (of the body): by means of the Dakshi _n_\nas he thus strengthens this vital air in the centre (of the body); and to\nIndra also belongs the midday Soma-service, and at the midday-service the\nDakshi _n_ as are brought up: therefore. he should bring up the Dakshi _n_ as\nafter the invocation of the I _d_ a of the cake-offering.\n\n11:7:2:66\\. Here now they say, 'Seeing that the want of the purificatory bath\nin the case of the initiated is improper, Adhvaryu, when didst thou initiate\nhim?' Well, let them 1 sustain him till the purificatory bath,--to wit, the\nAdhvaryu, the Pratiprasthat _ri_ , the Hot _ri_ , the Maitravaru _n_ a, the\nBrahman, and the\n\np. 122\n\n[paragraph continues] \xc3\x82gnidhra, for it is through these that this (formula) is\ncalled 'sha _d_ _dh_ ot _ri_  1': having rapidly muttered that 'sha _d_ _dh_\not _ri_ ,' he offers, performing either one or five oblations of ghee 2,--'The\nheaven is his 3 back, the air his body, O Va _k_ aspati, by his limbs he gave\nrise to the sacrifice, by his forms to the earth; by his flawless voice and\nhis flawless tongue to the god-gladdening invocation, Hail!' This, indeed, is\nhis initiation.\n\n11:7:2:77\\. As to this they say, 'Seeing that the want of the purificatory\nbath in the case of the initiated is improper, Adhvaryu, when didst thou take\nhim down to the purificatory bath?' Well, when they perform with the heart-\nspit 4, that is his purificatory bath.\n\n11:7:2:88\\. Madhuka Pai\xe1\xb9\x85gya once said, 'Some perform the animal sacrifice\nwithout Soma, and others do so with Soma. Now, Soma was in the heavens, and\nGayatri, having become a bird, fetched him; and inasmuch as one of his leaves\n(par _n_ a) was cut off 5,\n\np. 123\n\nthat was how the Par _n_ a-tree arose:' such, indeed, is (the passage in) the\nBrahma _n_ a that is told. And some, it is true, perform the animal sacrifice\nwithout Soma, and others with Soma; for he who makes the sacrificial stake\nother than of Pala _s_ a wood, performs the animal sacrifice without Soma; and\nhe who makes the sacrificial stake of Pala _s_ a performs the animal sacrifice\nwith Soma: therefore let him make his sacrificial stake of Pala _s_ a wood.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[119:3](sbe44038.htm#fr_369) That is, the offering of the Agnishomiya he-goat\nwhich takes place on the day before the press-day (see part ii, p. 162 seqq.);\nwhilst the Savaniya-pa _s_ ubandha is performed on the day of the Soma-\nsacrifice itself; the victim being slaughtered during the morning-service, and\nthe flesh-portions cooked during the day and offered at the evening-service\n(cf. part ii, p. 313, note 3; p. 356, note 3).\n\n[119:4](sbe44038.htm#fr_370) That is, milk from the Vratadugha cow (which may\nbe mixed with some rice or barley; III, 2, 2, 14), the only food to be taken\nby the Sacrificer during his diksha, or period of initiation--in this case on\nthe day before the Soma-sacrifice.\n\n[120:1](sbe44038.htm#fr_371) That is, the so-called 'pra _n_ ita _h_ ' used\nfor sacrificial purposes generally, and especially for supplying what is\nrequired for pressing the Soma. Cf. the comm. on Katy. VI, 7, 19, where the\n'pra _n_ itapra _n_ ayana' is expressly referred to as a necessary element of\nthe performance of the Agnishomiya.\n\n[120:2](sbe44038.htm#fr_372) For the pouring out of the water on the south\nside of the Vedi, at the end of the Havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, see I, 9, 3, 1 seqq.\n\n[120:3](sbe44038.htm#fr_373) The Sacrificer intercepts with his hands some of\nthe water poured out, touches his face therewith, and then strides the three\nVish _n_ u-strides; cf. I, 9, 3, 8 seqq.\n\n[120:4](sbe44038.htm#fr_374) Viz. in case of the animal sacrifice being\nperformed on the Havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a or Ish _t_ i model; which, strictly\nspeaking, would involve the use of no other offering-material except milk,\nghee, and dishes made of cereals.\n\n[120:5](sbe44038.htm#fr_375) The usual order of subject and predicate would\nrequire the translation, 'the morning-service is its fore-offerings,' which\nwould hardly be in accordance with the author's reasoning.\n\n[120:6](sbe44038.htm#fr_376) For the pa _s_ u-puro _d_ a _s_ a, III, 8, 3, 1\nseqq.\n\n[120:7](sbe44038.htm#fr_377) That is, prior to the offering of the 'animal\ncake' (pa _s_ u-puro _d_ a _s_ a), whilst the presentation of the dakshi _n_\nas--a head of cattle, or a milch-cow, or some other desirable object--\naccording to Katy. VI, 7, 29, should take place after the offering of the I\n_d_ a, which marks the end of the Pa _s_ u-puro _d_ a _s_ a-ish _t_ i.\n\n[121:1](sbe44038.htm#fr_378) Saya _n_ a supplies ' _g_ ana _h_ ,' 'the\npeople;' but possibly the text of the commentary may be corrupt in this place.\nThe author's meaning would seem to be that, as there is no purificatory bath\nat the end of the animal sacrifice performed on the Soma-day, the Sacrificer's\nstrength is to be kept up by the Sha _d_ _dh_ ot _ri_ formula (representing\nthe six priests themselves) which will carry him as far as the purificatory\nbath at the end of the Soma-sacrifice. I am, however, far from sure that this\nis the real meaning of the passage. The Sha _d_ _dh_ ot _ri_ is performed (at\nthe animal sacrifice of the pressing-day) shortly after the beginning of the\nceremonies connected with the Pa _s_ ubandha, viz. immediately after the\n'yupahuti,' see part ii, p. 162 seqq.\n\n[122:1](sbe44038.htm#fr_379) That is, one containing (mentioning), or\nrequiring, six offering-priests, the number required for the animal sacrifice.\n\n[122:2](sbe44038.htm#fr_380) In either case the offering consists of five\nladlings of ghee; and in the case of a single oblation, according to Saya _n_\na, a different dipping-spoon (sruva) would seem to be used for each ladling;\nunless, indeed, 'ekaikena sruvena' mean 'with one sruva-full each.' According\nto Katy. VI, 1, 36, the formula is merely 'run through mentally.'\n\n[122:3](sbe44038.htm#fr_381) Saya _n_ a interprets 'thy back'; and he\napparently supplies 'prapnoti' at the end of the first half-verse, whilst\n'airayat' he takes to stand for the second person singular.\n\n[122:4](sbe44038.htm#fr_382) That is, when the heart is roasted on the spit\nprior to its being offered; see III, 8, 3, 16. This use of the spit is to take\nthe place of the purificatory bath, the technical term of which is 'spit-bath'\n( _s_ ulavabh _ri_ tha), the spit being on that occasion buried at the point\nwhere the dry and the moist meet,' see III, 8, 5, 8-10.\n\n[122:5](sbe44038.htm#fr_383) Either a leaf of Soma or a feather of Gayatri was\ncut off by an p. 123 arrow shot by an archer pursuing Gayatri, and, on its\nfalling to the earth, a Pala _s_ a, or Par _n_ a, tree (Butea frondosa) sprang\nforth, see III, 3, 4, 10.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 7, 3.
