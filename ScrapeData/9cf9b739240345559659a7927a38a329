He proceeds with the rice-pap to Aditi, as the concluding oblation.\nThe reason why there is a rice-pap for Aditi is this. Because, on that former\noccasion 2, the gods said to her, 'Thine forsooth shall be the opening, and\nthine the concluding oblation,' therefore he prepares that share for her at\nboth ends (of the Soma-sacrifice).\n\n4:5:1:22\\. And because, on that occasion, he offers when about to go forth\n(upa-pra-i) to buy the king (Soma), therefore that (opening oblation) is\ncalled Praya _n_ iya. And because he now offers after coming out (ud-a-i) from\nthe expiatory bath, therefore this (concluding oblation) is called Udaya _n_\niya 3. For this indeed is one and the same oblation: to Aditi belongs the\nopening, to Aditi the concluding (oblation); for Aditi is this (earth).\n\n4:5:1:33\\. To Pathya Svasti he offers first (at the opening sacrifice): then\nthe gods, through speech, saw their way in what was unknown to them, for by\nspeech the confused becomes known. But now that it is known, he performs in\nthe proper order.\n\n4:5:1:44\\. To Agni he offers first, then to Soma, then to Savit _ri_ , then to\nPathya Svasti, then to Aditi, Now Pathya Svasti (the wishing of a 'happy\njourney')\n\np. 387\n\nis speech, and Aditi is this (earth): on her the gods thereby established\nspeech, and thus established thereon speech speaks here.\n\n4:5:1:55\\. Thereupon he slaughters a barren anubandhya 1 cow for Mitra and\nVaru _n_ a. And this indeed is performed as a different sacrifice, and that an\nanimal offering; for the Samish _t_ aya _g_ us form the end of the sacrifice.\n\n4:5:1:66\\. The reason why there is a barren cow for Mitra and Varu _n_ a is\nthis. Whatever part of his (sacrifice) 2 who has offered is well-offered that\npart of his Mitra takes, and whatever is ill-offered that Varu _n_ a takes.\n\n4:5:1:77\\. Then they say, 'What has become of the sacrificer?'--whatever well-\noffered part of his (sacrifice) Mitra here takes, that he now again surrenders\nto him, being pleased with this (cow); and whatever ill-offered part of his\nVaru _n_ a takes, that indeed he makes well-offered for him, being pleased\nwith this (cow), and surrenders it again to him. This forsooth is his own\nsacrifice 3, his own merit.\n\n4:5:1:88\\. And again, why there is a barren cow for Mitra and Varu _n_ a. Now,\nwhen the gods caused the cast seed to spring,--there is that _s_ astra called\n\xc3\x82gnimaruta 4: in connection therewith it is explained how\n\np. 388\n\nthe gods caused that seed to spring. From it the coals (a\xe1\xb9\x85gara) sprung, and\nfrom the coals the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras; and after that the other animals 1.\n\n4:5:1:99\\. Then the dust of the ashes which remained: therefrom the ass was\nproduced,--hence when it is dusty anywhere, people say, 'A very place for\nasses, forsooth 2!' And when no sap whatever remained,--thence was produced\nthat barren cow belonging to Mitra and Varu _n_ a; wherefore that (cow) does\nnot bring forth, for from sap seed is produced, and from seed cattle. And\nbecause she was produced at the end, therefore she comes after the end of the\nsacrifice. Hence also a barren cow for Mitra and Varu _n_ a is the most proper\nhere: if he cannot obtain a barren cow, it may also be a bullock 3.\n\n4:5:1:1010\\. Then the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_ applied themselves 4 a second time:\nthence the Vai _s_ vadevi (cow) was produced; then the Barhaspatya: that is\nthe end, for B _ri_ haspati is the end.\n\n4:5:1:1111\\. And whosoever gives a thousand or more\n\np. 389\n\n[paragraph continues] (cows to the priests), he will slaughter all\nthese;--indeed, everything is obtained, everything conquered by him who gives\na thousand or more. Those (three) cows are everything, (when offered) thus in\nthe proper order: first one to Mitra and Varu _n_ a, then one to the All-gods,\nthen one to B _ri_ haspati.\n\n4:5:1:1212\\. And those who perform a long sacrificial session, for a year or\nmore, they will slaughter all these 1;--indeed everything is obtained,\neverything conquered by those who perform a long sacrificial session, for a\nyear or more: those (cows) are everything, (when offered) thus in the proper\norder.\n\n4:5:1:1313\\. Thereupon he performs the Udavasaniya ish _t_ i (completing\noblation). He prepares a cake on five potsherds for Agni. Its invitatory and\noffering prayers are five-footed pa\xe1\xb9\x85ktis 2. For at this time the sacrifice of\nhim who has sacrificed is, as it were, exhausted in strength: it, as it were,\npasses away from him. Now all sacrifices are Agni, since all sacrifices are\nperformed in him, the domestic sacrifices as well as others. He thus takes\nhold again of the sacrifice, and thus that sacrifice of his is\n\np. 390\n\nnot exhausted in strength, and does not pass away from him.\n\n4:5:1:1414\\. The reason why the cake is one on five potsherds, and the\ninvitatory and offering prayers are pa\xe1\xb9\x85ktis (verses of five feet), is that the\nsacrifice is fivefold. He thus takes hold again of the sacrifice, and thus\nthat sacrifice of his is not exhausted in strength, and does not pass away\nfrom him.\n\n4:5:1:1515\\. The priests' fee for it is gold; for this is a sacrifice to Agni,\nand gold is Agni's seed: therefore the priests' fee is gold. Or an ox, for\nsuch a one is of Agni's nature as regards its shoulder, since its shoulder\n(bearing the yoke) is as if burnt by fire.\n\n4:5:1:1616\\. Or 1, he takes ghee in five ladlings, and offers it with the\nverse to Vish _n_ u (Va _g_. S. V, 38), 'Stride thou widely, O Vish _n_ u,\nmake wide room for our abode! drink the ghee, thou born of ghee, and speed the\nlord of the sacrifice ever onwards, Hail!' For Vish _n_ u is the sacrifice: he\nthus takes hold again of the sacrifice, and thus his sacrifice is not\nexhausted in strength, and does not pass away from him. And let him on this\noccasion give as much as he can afford, for no offering, they say, should be\nwithout a Dakshi _n_ a. When this Udavasaniya-ish _t_ i is completed, he\noffers the (ordinary) evening (milk) offering 2,--but the morning offering at\nits proper time.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[386:2](sbe2660.htm#fr_900) See [III, 2, 3, 6](sbe2609.htm#3:2:3:6).\n\n[386:3](sbe2660.htm#fr_901) See [p. 48](sbe2609.htm#page_48), note\n[1](sbe2609.htm#fn_125).\n\n[387:1](sbe2660.htm#fr_902) The meaning of this technical term would seem to\nbe 'to be bound (or immolated) after' the sacrifice.\n\n[387:2](sbe2660.htm#fr_903) Or, of him, the sacrificer.\n\n[387:3](sbe2660.htm#fr_904) That is, the sacrifice of his own self.\n\n[387:4](sbe2660.htm#fr_905) The same passage occurs at I, 7, 4, 4, where I\nerroneously supplied 'samabhavat.' It is a broken, incoherent construction.\nThe explanation, referred to in these two passages, may be Ait. Br. III, 34,\nthough in that case one might have expected a somewhat closer adherence to the\norder of production there proposed; p. 388 see part i, p. 210, note 1.\nRegarding the \xc3\x82gnimaruta _s_ astra, see above, [p. 369](sbe2656.htm#page_369)\nnote .\n\n[388:1](sbe2660.htm#fr_906) ? Or, the others, the animals (tad any anye pa _s_\nava _h_ ). Cp. the French idiom, 'Les femmes et nous autres hommes.' The Ka\n_n_ va text reads, tad anu pa _s_ ava _h_.\n\n[388:2](sbe2660.htm#fr_907) The Ka _n_ va reads, And when they (the coals)\nbecame dust of ashes, the ass was produced therefrom: hence they call 'asses'\nplace' where the dust of the ashes (lies).\n\n[388:3](sbe2660.htm#fr_908) Katy. X, 9,15 allows, in lieu of the animal\noffering, an oblation of clotted curds (payasya or amiksha). See also II, 4,\n2, 1 4.\n\n[388:4](sbe2660.htm#fr_909) ? They applied their minds, or, they took hold\n(amarim _ri_ _s_ anta): 'Tad u vi _s_ ve deva marim _ri_ _s_ a _m_ _k_ akrire\ntato dvitiya vai _s_ vadevi samabhavat.' Ka _n_ va text. Perhaps the verb has\nhere the same meaning as 'dhu' in the passage of the Ait. Br. referred to, tad\n(reto) maruto 'dhunvan.\n\n[389:1](sbe2660.htm#fr_910) The immolation of the three anubandhya cows is\nprescribed at the end of the Gavamayana (see note on [IV, 5, 4,\n14](sbe2663.htm#4:5:4:14)), and at other Sattras (sacrificial session) lasting\nat least a year, and endowed with fees of at least a thousand cows, except the\nSarasvata Sattra. Katy. XIII, 4, 4, 5.\n\n[389:2](sbe2660.htm#fr_911) The Udavasaniya ish _t_ i is performed, with\ncertain modifications, on the model of the Paunaradheyiki ish _t_ i, or\noffering for the re-establishment of the sacred fire; for which see II, 2, 3,\n4 seq., and especially the notes on part i, p. 317 seq. It is to be performed\nsomewhere north of the sacrificial ground on a fire produced by the churning\nof the ara _n_ is or (pairs of) churning-sticks, with which the priests have\npreviously 'lifted' their several fires. See [p. 90](sbe2615.htm#page_90),\nnotes [4](sbe2615.htm#fn_240) and [5](sbe2615.htm#fn_241); and part i, p. 396,\nnote 1.\n\n[390:1](sbe2660.htm#fr_912) According to Katy. X, 9, 20 (as interpreted by the\ncommentator) this (Vaish _n_ avi) ahuti may optionally take the place of the\nUdavasaniya ish _t_ i. 'Atho' has evidently the force of 'or' here, as in IV,\n6, 4, 5. The Ka _n_ va text has atho apy ahutim eva _g_ uhuyat; with the same\nmeaning, cf. I, 1, 3, 3; also 'uto,' note to [IV, 5, 2,\n13](sbe2661.htm#4:5:2:13).\n\n[390:2](sbe2660.htm#fr_913) For the Agnihotra, or morning and evening libation\nof milk, see II, 2, 4; 3, 4. The performance being completed, the temporary p.\n391 erections, as the Sadas, cart-shed, \xc3\x82gnidhra fire-house, &c., are set on\nfire, and the sacrificer and priests go home.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 5, 2.
