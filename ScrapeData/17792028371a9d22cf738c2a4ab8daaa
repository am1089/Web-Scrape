The light (is Brahman), on account of that (Brahman) being seen (in the\nscriptural passage).\n\nWe read in Scripture, 'Thus does that serene being, arising from this body,\nappear in its own form as soon as it has approached the highest light' ( _Kh_.\nUp. VIII, 12, 3). Here the doubt arises whether the word 'light' denotes the\n(physical) light, which is the object of sight and dispels darkness, or the\nhighest Brahman.\n\np. 232\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that the word 'light' denotes the well-known\n(physical) light, because that is the conventional sense of the word. For\nwhile it is to be admitted that in another passage, discussed under I, 1, 24,\nthe word 'light' does, owing to the general topic of the chapter, divest\nitself of its ordinary meaning and denote Brahman, there is in our passage no\nsimilar reason for setting the ordinary meaning aside. Moreover, it is stated\nin the chapter treating of the na _d_ is of the body, that a man going to\nfinal release reaches the sun ('When he departs from this body then he departs\nupwards by those very rays;' _Kh_. Up. VIII, 6, 5). Hence we conclude that the\nword 'light' denotes, in our passage, the ordinary light.\n\nTo this we make the following reply.--The word 'light' can denote the highest\nBrahman only, on account of that being seen. We see that in the whole chapter\nBrahman is carried on as the topic of discussion. For the Self, which is free\nfrom sin, &c. is introduced as the general subject-matter in VIII, 7, 1 ('the\nSelf which is free from sin '); it is thereupon set forth as that which is to\nbe searched out and to be understood (VIII, 7, 1); it is carried on by means\nof the clauses, 'I shall explain that further to you' (VIII, 9, 3 ff.); after\nthat freedom from body is said to belong to it, because it is one with light\n('when he is free from the body then neither pleasure nor pain touches him,'\nVIII, 12, 1)--and freedom from body is not possible outside Brahman--and it is\nfinally qualified as 'the highest light, the highest person' (VIII, 12, 3).--\nAgainst the statement, made by the purvapakshin, that Scripture speaks of a\nman going to release as reaching the sun, we remark, that the release there\nreferred to is not the ultimate one, since it is said to be connected with\ngoing and departing upwards. That the ultimate release has nothing to do with\ngoing and departing upwards we shall show later on.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 41](sbe34110.htm)\n\n"
