At dawn of day, Kesee came to\nBrindabun in the form of an immense horse of terrifying aspect; and began to\npaw the ground, and dig up the earth; having blood-shot eyes, and uplifted\nnostrils, and ears and tail erect; and continued neighing and writhing its\nshoulders and kicking.\n\nOn seeing the animal, the cowherds\' children were frightened, and ran off and\ntold Krishnu, who came to the spot: and on beholding it, made preparations for\nan encounter, and striking the upper parts of his arms, roared like a lion,\nexclaiming, "If you are a great friend of Kuns, and have come here in the form\nof a horse, why do you run after others? Come and fight with me, that I may\nsee your strength? How long will you wander about, like a moth circling round\na lamp? Your death is at hand." On hearing these words Kesee was enraged, and\nbegan to say to himself, "To-day I will make trial of his power, and laying\nhold of him and chewing him like sugar-cane, will do what Kuns wishes." He\nthen rushed forward with his mouth open, as though he would devour the\n\np. 130\n\nwhole world. On his first approach he attacked Krishnu with his mouth, who\ndrove him back; when he rushed forward the second time with his mouth open,\nafter having recovered from the first shock, Shree Krishnu thrust his hand\ninto his mouth, and so enlarged his hand, which was like an iron club, that it\nblocked up the ten passages of the horse\'s body. Kesee was alarmed, and began\n\'to say to himself, "My body is now bursting, how has this happened? I have\nadmitted my own death into my mouth, and have lost my life, as a fish loses\nits life by swallowing a hook."\n\nHe then attempted many plans of extricating the hand, not one of which\nsucceeded. At length, he ceased to breathe, and his belly burst, so that he\nfell backwards. The blood streamed from his body like a river. At this time\nthe cowherds\' children came to see what had happened; and Shree Krishnu Chund\nadvanced into the jungle, and stood under the shade of a kudum tree. In the\nmean while Narud, the sage, arrived with a lute in his hand. Having made an\nobeisance, he stood up, and playing on the lute, and singing of the past and\nfuture sports and exploits of Shree Krishnu Chund, he said, "O lord of\ncompassion! your sports are unlimited. Who has power to describe your actions?\nBut through your favour I know so much, that you frequently descend and are\nmanifest upon the earth to confer happiness on your worshippers, protect\nvirtuous men, destroy demons and evil spirits and remove the burthens of the\nworld."\n\nOn hearing these words Krishnu permitted Narud, the sage, to depart; and he\nbowed his head and went away. Krishnu took all the cowherds\' children and his\ncompanions with him; and sitting under a fig tree, he made one a minister,\nanother a counsellor of state, a third the chief of an army, and being himself\na Raja, they all began to play a game in imitation of royalty, and afterwards\nat blind man\'s buff.\n\nHaving recited so much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O lord of the\nearth! Kuns having heard that Kesee had\n\np. 131\n\nbeen killed, early in the morning, raving and trembling, said to Byomasoor, "O\npowerful Byomasoor! the extirpator of enemies, great is your fame in the\nworld! As the son of Poonuvu (the ape Hunooman) is Rain\'s messenger of death,\nso are you mine. Destroy the sons of Basoodeo, effect this object for me to-\nday."\n\nByomasoor with joined hands said in reply, "O great king! to-day I will do all\nin my power. My body is yours. They, who are fond of life, shrink from\nsacrificing it for their masters. The good name and virtue of servants and\nwives consist in giving up their lives for their lords."\n\nHaving thus spoken, and taken up the beera of betel in token of undertaking\nthe project, proposed by Kuns, against Krishnu and Buldeo, Byomasoor made an\nobeisance to Kuns, and set out for Brindabun. On the road he assumed the\nappearance of a cowherd, and arrived in that disguise at the place where Huri\nwas playing at blind man\'s buff with the cowherds\' children and their\ncompanions. When, as he was going along, he said to Krishnu from a distance\nwith his hands joined, "O great king! allow me also to play with you," Huri\ninvited him to come near, and said, "Do not conceal any wish you may have\nformed, but play with us at any game you prefer?" He was delighted, and\nreplied, "The wolf and rams is a good game." Shree Krishnu Chund smiled and\nsaid, "Very good, you be the wolf, and the cowherds\' children shall be the\nrams."\n\nByomasoor was rejoiced at these words, and became a wolf, and the cowherds\'\nchildren were rams, and they began to play the game together. The demon took\nthem off one by one, and placed them in the cave of a hill, and shut them up\nthere, by placing a stone across the entrance. When he had thus placed them\nall there, and Shree Krishnu alone remained, he called out, "I will to-day\naccomplish Kuns\' business for him, and destroy all the family of Judoo."\n\np. 132\n\nHaving thus spoken, and abandoned the appearance of a cowherd, and having been\ntransformed into a real wolf, he rushed upon Krishnu, who seizing him\ndespatched him by means of suffocation and blows, in the way the sacrificial\ngoat is killed.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXXIX](psa40.htm)\n\n'
