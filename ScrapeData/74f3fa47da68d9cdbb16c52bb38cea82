It is St. Thomas Aquinas himself who points out that prayer cannot\navail to change the will of God, but may, in any given case, be the appointed\nmeans of its accomplishment. Truth is not something that is told of in books\nor stated in words. It is the self-evident, the ultimate. It is that of which\nall our modes of seeing and saying are but so many refractions through a\nfalsifying medium. All the teachings of Christianity put together are but as a\nvase or form, within which is conveyed to us the central actuality, the\nbeautiful myth of the Christian soul.\n\nAnd rightly so. For what is the real stuff of the human tragedy, the hunger\nfor bread, or the longing for salvation? The answer is not doubtful. And this,\nalthough it may be, more than half of us are without any conception of that\nwhich we seek to save, or what it is from which we seek to fly. The fact\nremains, the human race is dominated by an inexpressible desire for the well-\nbeing of a metaphysical something which it cannot conceive of, but calls the\nsoul. And any scheme, even the wildest, that makes profession of accomplishing\nthis object, will meet with some measure of welcome and approval, provided\nonly that he who offers is\n\np. 169\n\nsufficiently convinced of the efficacy of his own method.\n\nMost beautiful, perhaps, of all those known to us, is the series of pictures\nin which Catholicism paints her promise of deliverance. The little bark of\nlife, in which the soul puts out to sea, to be guided in its tossings and\nwanderings by a science that the Church names saving knowledge; the mysterious\ntransition of death, by which it lands on the shores of purification; and,\nfinally, the pain of sanctification exhausted, its being received up into\nheaven, and attainment of the Beatific Vision.\n\nBut, after all, are not the symbols somewhat crude? Heaven and hell, reward\nand punishment! Is it not possible for even a child to go beyond these? Can we\nattempt to describe what is meant by the moral sense, without implying that we\nwould choose good, though we suffered countless ages for it, and refrain from\nevil, though it brought us Heaven? Besides, are there not amongst us parents\nwho refuse to act out a melodrama of judgment every time a baby steals a\nsugar-plum? Is the whole universe, multiplied by eternity, only one vast\nkindergarten? Or are we somewhere to learn that in self-control itself is\nbeatitude? How are we to believe in salvation that is expressed as an event?\nin unchangeable happiness conferred upon us from without? in a _process_ of\nknowledge and praise?\n\nDo we not feel within us an ungovernable protest against these\nartificialities, an irrepressible claim for something that is the Nature-of-\nthings, and requires no stage-management; a desire to be done with\nvicissitudes, alike of heaven and hell, salvation and perdition, and find some\nfixed mean, some centre of enduring poise, which shall confer freedom from all\nperception of antitheses, and knowledge at last of That which is the thing in\nitself? Or are we so in love with the limitations of the\n\np. 170\n\npersonal existence, with the fact that our good is another\'s ill, that present\njoy is future pain, that we would, if we could, prolong the experience?\n\nSome such protest, at least, is apt to be roused in the Oriental by Western\ndreams of a. future life. It is all physical, all sense-impression, he says,\nand as such is necessarily subject to that law of change and decay which must\nsooner or later apply to all compounds. In the sublime imagination of the\nBeatific Vision, he catches a hint of a deeper reality, but why, he asks, this\ndistinction between time and eternity? Can the apprehension of the Infinite\nGood be conditioned by the clock? Oh, for a knowledge undimensioned, untimed,\neffect of no cause, cause of no effect! Reaching That, and That alone, we\ncould be sure of unchanging bliss, of existence ultimate. But if accessible at\nall, it must be now in the earth-life or never. It must transcend and still\nthe life of the senses, when the senses are most active; it must absorb and\ntransmute the personal, when personality is capable of every eager claim, or\nremain for ever incredible, save as one swing of a pendulum, some day to be\nreversed.\n\nThis is the illumination that India calls the knowledge of unity, and the\ngradual appropriation of it by the whole nature, so that it ceases to be mere\nwords and becomes a living actuality, she names realisation. Thus every step,\nevery movement in life is either dull and dead, or on fire with the growing\nknowledge that we know as spirituality. The highest genius becomes only an\nincident on the road to supreme blessedness. And the passionless desire of\nPheidias that wrought Olympian Zeus, the love of Dante for Beatrice, the\n"glorious nothingness" of S. Teresa, and the light on the face of Faraday the\nphysicist, are all alike and all equally beads on that rosary whereon the\nsoul\'s experience is told. For the\n\np. 171\n\nwhole story in all its forms is summed up, to Indian thinking, in the struggle\nto pass from the perceiving of manifoldness to the perceiving of One, and\nevery heightening of common knowledge is to be regarded as a step towards\nthis. The kitten at play will pursue first one object and then another with\nall the bewilderment and disconnectedness of the animal mind, while even the\nyoungest baby will show the superiority of human faculty by its greater\npersistence of purpose and pertinacity of desire. The man of low type is led\nhither and thither by every impulse of sensation, while Archimedes is so\nabsorbed in thought that he never perceives the Roman enter his presence, nor\ndreams of begging more than time to finish his speculation.\n\nIt must be remembered that to the Eastern intellect man himself is the\nuniverse, for all differentiation is within the mind. India may accept as a\nworking hypothesis the theory that sociology is the synthesis of all the\nsciences, but her own fundamental conviction is that psychology occupies this\nplace. Hence to her, power is always lodged in personality. Mind is the lord\nof body, undoubtedly; but mind, like body, is only the tool of the great Self\nof Things that stands behind and uses both for its own purpose. Like a\nstrangely complex telescope, one part of the instrument stands pointed to give\nreports of many kinds--of light, sound, weight, smell, taste, and touch; and\nby another we are led to conceive of vast ranges of these, outside the\npossibilities of our immediately perceiving, by which we can build up the\nconception that we call the Cosmos. But, according to Indian thinking again,\nperfect control over the apparatus has only been attained when every part of\nit can be directed at will to a common point--the whole power of investigation\nbrought to bear on any object. When this is done, when the intensest vibration\nof the whole\n\np. 172\n\nbeing is reached and every faculty is convergent on the point of attention,\nthen declares India, we, being one, perceive oneness, the mind sees truth face\nto face.\n\nHow we shall interpret and express the vision is determined wholly by our own\npast language and discipline. The mother comes out of it to love and serve;\nJoan of Arc commands armies with unfaltering insight; Sir Isaac Newton gives\nus the law of gravitation; Mozart produces his _Requiem Mass_ , and the\nMessiah comes down from the mountain side whispering, "I and My Father are\nOne." That is to say, the self-limited joys of sense have given way to the\npursuit of the good of others as an end in itself. The man is overpowered by a\nbeauty and a truth that he must needs share with the whole world. Or the\nfinite personality is completed, transcended, in union with the absolute and\nuniversal.\n\nThere are thus, as the East counts, two modes of existence--one the personal,\nor egoistic, and the other the impersonal, or supra-personal, where egoism and\naltruism are alike forgotten. The realisation of this illimitable existence is\nitself salvation, and is to be reached in life, not death. Concentration is\nits single secret, and real power is always power over oneself.\n\nWhat, then, are the common hindrances to this centring of thought and feeling\nthat we are not all constantly immersed in the Divine intoxication? And what\nare the paths by which we are ordinarily led to overcome such hindrances? For\nit is to be supposed that, if the experience be authentic, men first stumbled\nupon it by accident, and formulation of theory came afterwards.\n\nThe mind of man sweeps an infinite circle, and from every point upon the\nimmeasurable circumference runs a life-path to the division of Unity as the\ncommon centre. Each man is, as it were, a\n\np. 173\n\nnew window through which all others may look upon the Infinite, each life a\nnew name for That which we call God. The paths, therefore, are countless. No\ntwo methods can be exactly the same. Yet there are certain broad\ncharacteristics which are more or less general.\n\n\n\nThe soul that thirsts for service, gradually expunging from the area of motive\neven the subtler shades of selfishness--such as the preference for special\nforms of activity, exactingness on behalf of work, and desire for sympathy and\naffection as the result--this soul will more readily than another lose itself\nin the supreme intuition of the good of others. "The People" with Mazzini,\n"the fair realm of France" with Joan of Arc, the fulfilment of duty to his\ncountry with the great sovereign or statesman, are amongst the forms which\nthis realisation takes. In such a mood of uttermost blessedness, some have\neven suffered death by fire.\n\nThe temporary experience, in which the subject becomes unconscious of bodily\nsensation, is called _samadhi_. The process by which he comes out of samadhi\ntime after time, to work its volume of force, so to speak, into his daily\nlife, is known as realisation. And the path of service in purity of motive, is\nspoken of as _karma yoga_ , or divine union by work.\n\n\n\nAgain, we can in some measure understand the development of a nature to whom\neverything appears in degrees of lovableness. This was undoubtedly the method\nof S. Francis, and after him of S. Teresa. It is called in India _bhakti_ , or\ndevotion. Gradually, in such souls--guided by the thought of reaching the\nInfinite in abnegation of self--the power of love becomes a fire scorching,\nburning, consuming the barriers of individuality. "One cannot understand,"\nsays S. Teresa, "what is meant by talking of the\n\np. 174\n\nimpermanence of worldly joys. For one would renounce them so much the more\ngladly, could they but be eternal." Then there is a fusing of all things in\nthe one conception of the Beloved. Lastly, distinction ceases, self is\nforgotten, there is left nothing, save the Infinite Love. First the prayer of\nquiet, then the prayer of Union, last the irresistible rapture, says the great\nCarmelite. Such is _bhakti-yoga_ , the road by which the vast majority of the\nsaints have gone.\n\nHighest of all, however, is Union by knowledge, or _jnana-yoga_. A life whose\nwhole struggle is the passion for truth; a soul to which falsehood or\nsuperstition is the worst of sins; a mind clear as the black depths of a\nmountain-pool; an atmosphere of joy, all stillness, all calm, all radiance\nwithout emotion; to these comes the growing intensity of recognition, the\nincreasing power of direct vision, and finally that last illumination, in\nwhich there is neither knower, knowing nor known, but all is one in Oneness.\nIt is much to be regretted that we have in English no word corresponding to\n_jnana_. _Insight_ has a certain affinity, but is not sufficiently intense.\nThe fact is, the habit of thought that leads up to the conception is foreign\nto us: a true parallelism is, therefore, out of the question.\n\nThe greatest _jnani_ that has appeared in human history was undoubtedly\nBuddha, for the calmness of intellect predominates in Him, living through a\nministry of more than forty years, though it was the immense outburst of His\nlove and pity (explained as the fruit of five hundred sacrifices of Himself)\nthat drove Him forth on His passionate quest to serve mankind. Then He is also\nin a high degree a combination of the three types of realisation--by\nintellect, heart and work. Some measure of this amalgamation there must be in\nall who use their knowledge for the good of others, of whom the\n\np. 175\n\n[paragraph continues] Incarnations are the culminating type. For in _jnana_ by\nitself, the personal existence is seen to be a dream, a mere illusion, and it\nis impossible for him, who has once received its overwhelming revelation, to\nbelieve that there exist outside himself other centres of illusion for whose\nemancipation he might work.\n\nFor _karma_ , or service, again, there could be no sufficient motive, without\nthe impulse of _bhakti_. And the madness of divine love, unlighted by\nknowledge, unawaking to compassion, is almost unthinkable.\n\nSuch are the three ways--truth, devotion, and good works--by which it is said\nthat souls may reach their goal. He who has attained, and remains in life, is\ncalled a Paramahamsa, or swan amongst men. And of all such, Suke\\--he to whom\nit was given while in mortal form to drink a handful of the waters of the\nocean of super-consciousness--is ideal and head. For most men die, it has been\nsaid, having heard only the thunder of its waves upon the shore; a few come\nwithin sight: fewer still taste; to Suke alone was it given to drink. Many\nMohammedan saints have become Paramahamsas, and are equally loved and\nreverenced by all religions alike.\n\nSo far of the apprehension of unity when consciousness and self-direction have\nmade it vital spirituality. The hindrance to our reaching it is always, it is\ndeclared, one, namely, under whatever guise, want of the power to give up\nself. "When desire is gone, and all the cords of the hearts are broken, _then_\n," says the Upanishad, "a man attains to immortality." And by "immortality,"\nit should be understood, is here meant the quality of deathlessness. For this\nreason, all religions are a call to renunciation; all ethics negate\nselfishness of personality; all disciplines are a repression of individual\nimpulse. In the Indian doctrine of One\n\np. 176\n\nimmanent in the many, all these receive interpretation. The scholar s\nausterity of study; the artist\'s striving to become the witness; the lover\'s\ndesire to sacrifice himself; all speak, however unconsciously, of our longing\nnot to be, that the infinite, the universal consciousness, may abide within\nus.\n\nThe fact that the final achievement is variously known as Freedom, Mukti, or\nNirvana, the annihilation of the limited, requires, at this point, little\nexplanation. The idea that the perception of manifoldness is _Maya_ or\nillusion, that the One is the real, and the many unreal, underlies the whole\ntheory. "They that behold the One in all the changing manifoldness of this\nuniverse, unto _them_ belongs eternal peace--unto none else, unto none else."\n\nObviously, the final truth of the doctrine is capable of no other proof or\ndisproof than that of experience. But the attitude to it of the common Indian\nmind is strictly scientific. We cannot prove, save by making the experiment,\nbut we can point to the fact that the accumulated observation of life goes to\nestablish the tenableness of the proposition, says India in effect. And when\nwe are shown one morality that does not demand the holding of unity of\nprinciple against manifoldness of impulse; one science that does not grow by\nthe correlating of apparent discrepancies in continually stricter unities; or\none character that does not find perfection in surrendering the personal to\nthe impersonal, the theory of Maya--real unity amidst apparent diversity--will\nfall to the ground, and must be acknowledged a misconception. Hitherto, it may\nbe claimed, the whole history of the world has not sufficed to furnish the\nrequired exception.\n\nThus the beatific vision of Hinduism is not unlike that of Dante\'s Empyrean,\nonly it is to be relegated to no distant future, but triumphantly vindicated\nwithin mortality itself. The name of God and the\n\np. 177\n\nconventions of piety are as unreal as anything else in Maya, but they have the\npower of enabling us to break its bondage, whereas the delights of the senses\nonly fasten it the tighter.\n\nOne point remains. The doctrine with which we have been dealing represents a\nnational culture. Very few in the West can be said to have grasped the whole\nsecret of that for which their country stands. Very few will be found to\nunderstand deeply any given idea or subject. The very reverse is the case in\nthe East. Men who have no emancipation into the scheme of modern knowledge are\nemancipated into the sequence of renunciation and freedom. Though India is\ndaily losing her grip on her own character, she is still the motherland of\nhundreds of the saints. And amongst that people of ancient aristocracies the\nrealm of the ideal is so completely democratised that the poorest peasant, the\nmeanest workman, comprehends what is meant by the great daily prayer of\nHinduism:--\n\nFrom the Unreal, lead us to the Real!  \nFrom darkness, lead us unto light!  \nFrom death, lead us to immortality!  \nReach us through and through ourself,  \nAnd evermore protect us--O Thou Terrible!--  \nFrom ignorance by Thy sweet compassionate Face.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XI.
