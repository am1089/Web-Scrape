But only those former (works) whose effects have not yet begun (are\ndestroyed by knowledge); because (scripture states) that (i.e. the death of\nthe body) to be the term.\n\nIn the two preceding adhikara _n_ as it has been proved that good as well as\nevil works are annihilated through knowledge. We now have to consider the\nquestion whether this annihilation extends, without distinction, to those\nworks whose effects have already begun to operate as well as to those whose\neffects have not yet begun; or only to works of the latter kind.\n\nHere the purvapakshin maintains that on the ground of scriptural passages such\nas 'He thereby overcomes both,' which refer to all works without any\ndistinction, all works whatever must be considered to undergo destruction.\n\nTo this we reply, 'But only those whose effects have not begun.' Former works,\ni.e. works, whether good or evil, which have been accumulated in previous\nforms of existence as well as in the current form of existence before the\norigination of knowledge, are destroyed by the attainment of knowledge only if\ntheir fruit has not yet begun to operate. Those works, on the other hand,\nwhose effects have begun and whose results have been half enjoyed--i.e. those\nvery works to which there is due the present state of existence in which the\nknowledge of Brahman arises--are not destroyed by that knowledge. This opinion\nis founded on the scriptural passage, 'For him there is delay only as long as\nhe is not delivered (from the body)' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 14, 2), which fixes the\ndeath of the body as the term of the attainment of final release. Were it\notherwise,\n\np. 358\n\ni.e. were all works whatever extinguished by knowledge, there would be no\nreason for the continuance of the current form of existence, and the rise of\nknowledge would therefore be immediately followed by the state of final\nrelease; in which case scripture would not teach that one has to wait for the\ndeath of the body.--But, an objection is raised, the knowledge of the Self\nbeing essentially non-active does by its intrinsic power destroy (all) works;\nhow then should it destroy some only and leave others unaffected? We certainly\nhave no right to assume that when fire and seeds come into contact the\ngerminative power of some seeds only is destroyed while that of others remains\nunimpaired!--The origination of knowledge, we reply, cannot take place without\ndependence on an aggregate of works whose effects have already begun to\noperate, and when this dependence has once been entered into, we must--as in\nthe case of the potter's wheel--wait until the motion of that which once has\nbegun to move comes to an end, there being nothing to obstruct it in the\ninterim. The knowledge of our Self being essentially non-active destroys all\nworks by means of refuting wrong knowledge; but wrong knowledge--comparable to\nthe appearance of a double moon--lasts for some time even after it has been\nrefuted, owing to the impression it has made.--Moreover it is not a matter for\ndispute at all whether the body of him who knows Brahman continues to exist\nfor some time or not. For how can one man contest the fact of another\npossessing the knowledge of Brahman--vouched for by his heart's conviction--\nand at the same time continuing to enjoy bodily existence? This same point is\nexplained in scripture and Sm _ri_ ti, where they describe him who stands firm\nin the highest knowledge.--The final decision therefore is that knowledge\neffects the destruction of those works only--whether good or evil--whose\neffects have not yet begun to operate.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 1, 16](sbe38277.htm)\n\n"
