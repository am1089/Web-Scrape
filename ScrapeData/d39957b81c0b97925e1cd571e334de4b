Ceylon is\nseparated from India by a broad channel of the sea, and Hanuman leaped, or\nrather flew through the air, across the channel, and lighted on the island.\nSita, scorning the proposals of Ravan, was kept in confinement in a garden of\nAsoka trees, surrounded by a terrible guard of Raksha females; and in this\nhard confinement she remained true and faithful to her lord. Hanuman gave her\na token from Rama, and carried back to Rama a token which she sent of her\nundying affection and truth.\n\nThe portions translated in this Book form the whole of the main portions of\nSections xv., xxxi., xxxvi., and lxvi, of Book v. of the original text.\n\n## I\n\n## SITA IN THE ASOKA GARDEN\n\nCrossed the ocean\'s boundless waters, Hanuman in duty brave,  \nLighted on the emerald island girded by the sapphire wave,\n\nAnd in tireless quest of Sita searched the margin of the sea,  \nIn a dark Asoka garden hid himself within a tree.\n\nCreepers threw their clasping tendrils round the trees of ample height,  \nStately palm and feathered cocoa, fruit and blossom pleased the sight,\n\nHerds of tame and gentle creatures in the grassy meadow strayed,  \n_Kokils_ sang in leafy thicket, birds of plumage lit the shade,\n\nLimpid lakes of scented lotus with their fragrance filled the air,  \nHomes and huts of rustic beauty peeped through bushes green and fair,\n\nBlossoms rich in tint and fragrance in the checkered shadow gleamed,  \nClustering fruits of golden beauty in the yellow sunlight beamed!\n\nBrightly shone the red _Asoka_ with the morning\'s golden ray,  \n_Karnikara_ and _Kinsuka_ dazzling as the light of day,\n\nBrightly grew the flower of _Champak_ in the vale and on the reef,  \n_Punnaga_ and _Saptaparna_ with its seven-fold scented leaf,\n\nRich in blossoms many tinted, grateful to the ravished eye,  \nGay and green and glorious Kanka was like garden of the sky,\n\nRich in fruit and laden creeper and in beauteous bush and trep.  \nFlower-bespangled golden Lanka was like gem-bespangled sea!\n\nRose a palace in the woodlands girt by pillars strong and high.  \nSnowy-white like fair Kailasa cleaving through the azure sky,\n\nAnd its steps were ocean coral and its pavement yellow gold.  \nWhite and gay and heaven-aspiring rose the structure high and bold!\n\nBy the rich and royal mansion Hanuman his eyes did rest,  \nOn a woman sad and sorrowing in her sylvan garments drest,\n\nLike the moon obscured and clouded, dim with shadows deep and dark,  \nLike the smoke-enshrouded red fire, dying with a feeble spark,\n\nLike the tempest-pelted lotus by the wind and torrent shaken,  \nLike the beauteous star Rohini by a _graha_ overtaken!\n\nFasts and vigils paled her beauty, tears bedimmed her tender grace,  \nAnguish dwelt within her bosom, sorrow darkened on her face,\n\nAnd she lived by Rakshas guarded, as a faint and timid deer,  \nSevered from her herd and kindred when the prowling wolves are near,\n\nAnd her raven locks ungathered hung behind in single braid,  \nAnd her gentle eye was lightless, and her brow was hid in shade!\n\n"This is she! the peerless princess, Rama\'s consort loved and lost,  \nThis is she! the saintly Sita, by a cruel fortune crost,"\n\nHanuman thus thought and pondered: "On her graceful form I spy,  \nGems and gold by sorrowing Rama oft depicted with it sigh,\n\nOn her ears the golden pendants and the tiger\'s sharpened tooth,  \nOn her arms the jewelled bracelets, tokens of unchanging truth,\n\nOn her pallid brow and bosom still the radiant jewels shine,  \nRama with a sweet affection did in early days entwine!\n\nHermit\'s garments clothe her person, braided is her raven hair,  \nMatted bark of trees of forest drape her neck and bosom fair,\n\nAnd a dower of dazzling beauty still bedecks her peerless face.  \nThough the shadowing tinge of sorrow darkens all her earlier grace!\n\nThis is she! the soft-eyed Sita, wept with unavailing tear,  \nThis is she! the faithful consort, unto Rama ever dear,\n\nUnforgetting and unchanging, truthful still in deed and word,  \nSita, in her silent suffering sorrows for her absent lord,\n\nStill for Rama lost but cherished, Sita heaves the choking sigh,  \nSita lives for righteous Rama, for her Rama she would die!"\n\n## II\n\n## THE VOICE OF HOPE\n\nHanuman from leafy shelters lifts his voice in sacred song,  \nTill the tale of Rama\'s glory Lanka\'s woods and vales prolong:\n\n"Listen, Lady, to my story;--Dasa-ratha famed in war,  \nRich in steeds and royal tuskers, armed men and battle car,\n\nRuled his realm in truth and virtue, in his bounty ever free,  \nOf the mighty race of Raghu mightiest king and monarch he,\n\nRobed in every royal virtue, great in peace in battle brave,  \nBlest in bliss of grateful nations, blest in blessings which he gave\n\nAnd his eldest-born and dearest, Rama soul of righteous might,  \nShone, as mid the stars resplendent shines the radiant Lord of Night,\n\nTrue unto his sacred duty, true unto his kith and kin,  \nFriend of piety and virtue, punisher of crime and sin,\n\nLoved in all his spacious empire, peopled mart and hermit\'s den,  \nWith a truer deeper kindness Rama loved his subject men!\n\nDasa-ratha, promise-fettered, then his cruel mandate gave,  \nRama with his wife and brother lived in woods and rocky cave,\n\nAnd he slayed the deer of jungle and he slept in leafy shade,  \nStem destroyer of the Rakshas in the pathless forests strayed,\n\nTill the monarch of the Rakshas,-fraudful is his impious life,  \nCheated Rama in the jungle, from his cottage stole his wife\n\nLong lamenting lone and weary Rama wandered in the wood,  \nSearched for Sita, in the jungle where his humble cottage stood,\n\nGodavari\'s gloomy gorges, Krishna\'s dark and wooded shore,  \nAnd the ravine, rock and valley, and the cloud-capped mountain hoar!\n\nThen he met the sad Sugriva in wild Malya\'s dark retreat,  \nWon for him his father\'s empire and his father\'s royal seat,\n\nNow Sagriva\'s countless forces wander far and wander near,  \nIn the search of stolen Sita still unto his Rama dear!\n\nI am henchman of Sugriva and the mighty sea have crost,  \nIn the quest of hidden Sita, Rama\'s consort loved and lost,\n\nAnd methinks that form of beauty, peerless shape of woman\'s grace,  \nIs my Rama\'s dear-loved consort, Rama\'s dear-remembered face!"\n\nHushed the voice: the ravished Sita cast her wond\'ring eyes around,  \nWhence that song of sudden gladness, whence that soul-entrancing sound?\n\nDawning hope and rising rapture overflowed her widowed heart,  \nIs it dream\'s deceitful whisper which the cruel Fates impart?\n\n## III\n\n## RAMA\'S TOKEN\n\n"\'Tis no dream\'s deceitful whisper!" Hantiman spake to the dame,  \nAs from darksome leafy shelter he to Rama\'s consort came,\n\n"Rama\'s messenger and vassal, token from thy lord I bring,  \nMark this bright ring, jewel-lettered with the dear name of thy king,\n\nFor the loved and cherished Sita, is to Rama ever dear,  \nAnd he sends his loving message and his force is drawing near!\n\nSita, held that tender token from her loved and cherished lord,  \nAnd once more herself she fancied to his loving arms restored,\n\nAnd her pallid face was lighted and her soft eve sent a spark,  \nAs the Moon regains her lustre freed from _Rahu\'s_ shadows dark!\n\nAnd with voice of deep emotion in each softly whispered word,  \nSpake her thoughts in gentle accents of her consort and her lord:\n\n"Messenger of love of Rama! Dauntless is thy deed and bold,  \nThou hast crossed the boundless ocean to the Raksha\'s castled hold,\n\nThou hast crossed the angry billows which confess no monarch\'s sway,  \nO\'er the face of rolling waters found thy unresisted way,\n\nThou hast done what living mortal never sought to do before,  \nDared the Raksha in his island, Ravan in his sea-girt shore!\n\nSpeak, if Rama lives in safety in the woods or by the hill,  \nAnd if young and gallant Lakshman faithful serves his brother still,\n\nSpeak, if Rama in his anger and his unforgiving ire,  \nHurls destruction on my captor like the world-consuming fire,\n\nSpeak, if Rama in his sorrow wets his pale and drooping eye,  \nIf the thought of absent Sita wakes within his heart a sigh!\n\nDoth my husband seek alliance with each wild and warlike chief,  \nStriving for a speedy vengeance and for Sita\'s quick relief,\n\nDoth he stir the warlike races to a fierce and veng-eful strife,  \nDealing death to ruthless Rakshas for this insult on his wife,\n\nDoth he still in fond remembrance cherish Sita loved of yore,  \nNursing in his hero-bosom tender sorrows evermore!\n\nDidst thou hear from far Ayodhya, from Kausalya royal dame,  \nFrom the true and tender Bharat prince of proud and peerless fame,\n\nDidst thou hear if royal Bharat leads his forces to the fight,  \nConquering Ravan\'s scattered army in his all-resistless might,\n\nDidst thou hear if brave Sugriva marshals Vanars in his wrath  \nAnd the young and gallant Lakshman seeks to cross the ocean path?"\n\nHanuman with due obeisance placed his hand upon his head,  \nBowed unto the queenly Sita and in gentle accents said:\n\n"Trust me, Lady, valiant Rama soon will greet his saintly wife,  \nE\'en as INDRA greets his goddess, SACHI dearer than his life,\n\nTrust me, Sita, conquering Rama comes with panoply of war,  \nShaking Lanka\'s sea-girt mountains . slaying Rakshas near and far!\n\nHe shall cross the boundless ocean with the battle\'s dread array,  \nHe shall smite the impious Ravan and the cruel Rakshas slay,\n\nMighty Gods and strong Asuras shall not hinder Rama\'s path,  \nWhen at Lanka\'s gates he thunders with his more than godlike wrath,\n\nDeadly YAMA, all-destroying, pales before his peerless might  \nWhen his red right arm of vengeance wrathful Rama lifts to smite!\n\nBy the lofty Mandar mountains, by the fruit and root I seek,  \nBy the cloud-obstructing Vindhyas, and by Malya\'s towering peak,\n\nI will swear, my gentle Lady, Rama\'s vengeance draweth nigh,  \nThou shalt see his beaming visage like the Lord of Midnight Sky,\n\nFirm in purpose Rama waiteth on the Prasra-vana hill,  \nAs upon the huge Airavat, INDRA, motionless and still!\n\n_\n\nFlesh of deer nor forest honey tasteth Rama true and bold,  \nTill he rescues cherished Sita from the Raksha\'s castled hold,\n\nThoughts of Sita leave not Rama dreary day or darksome night,  \nTill his vengeance deep and dreadful crushes Ravan in his might,\n\nForest flower nor scented creeper pleases Rama\'s anguished heart,  \nTill he, wins his wedded consort by his death-compelling dart!"\n\n_\n\n## IV\n\n## SITA\'S TOKEN\n\nToken from her raven tresses Sita to the Vanar gave,  \nHanuman with dauntless valour crossed once more the ocean wave,\n\nWhere in Prasra-vana\'s mountain Rama with his brother stayed,  \nJewel from the brow of Sita by her sorrowing consort laid,\n\nSpake of Ravan\'s foul endearment and his loathsome loving word,  \nSpake of Sita\'s scorn and anger and her truth unto her lord,\n\nTears of sorrow and affection from the warrior\'s eyelids start,  \nAs his consort\'s loving token Rama presses to his heart!\n\n"As the mother-cow, Sugriva, yields her milk beside her young,  \nWelling tears upon this token yields my heart by anguish wrung,\n\nWell I know this dear-loved jewel sparkling with the ray of heaven,  \nBorn in sea, by mighty INDRA to my Sita\'s father given,\n\nWell I know this tender token, Janak placed it on her hair,  \nWhen she came my bride and consort decked in beauty rich and rare,\n\nWell I know this sweet memorial, Sita wore it on her head,  \nAnd her proud and peerless beauty on the gem a lustre shed!\n\nAh, methink the gracious Janak stands again before my eye,  \nWith a father\'s fond affection, with a monarch\'s stature high,\n\nAh, methinks my bride and consort, she who wore it on her brow,  \nStands again before the altar, speaks again her loving row,\n\nAh, the sad, the sweet remembrance! ah, the happy days gone by,  \nOnce again, O loving vision, wilt thou gladden Rama\'s eye!\n\nSpeak again, my faithful vassal, how my Sita wept and prayed,  \nLike the water to the thirsty, dear to me what Sita said,\n\nDid she send this sweet remembrance as a blessing from above,  \nAs a true and tender token of a woman\'s changeless love,\n\nDid she waft her heart\'s affection o\'er the billows of the sea,  \nWherefore came she not in person from her foes and fetters free?\n\nllanuman, iny friend and comrade, lead me to the distant isle,  \nWhere my soft-eyed Sita lingers midst the Rakshas dark and vile,\n\nWhere my true and tender consort like a lone and stricken deer,  \nGirt by Rakshas stern and ruthless sheds the unavailing tear,\n\nWhere she weeps in ceaseless anguish, sorrow-stricken, sad and pale,  \nLike the Moon by dark clouds shrouded then her light and lustre fail!\n\nSpeak again, my faithful henchman, loving message of my wife,  \nLike some potent drug her accents renovate my fainting life,\n\nArm thy forces, friend Sugriva, Rama shall not brook delay,  \nWhile in distant Lanka\'s confines Sita weeps the livelong day,\n\nMarshal forth thy bannered forces, cross the ocean in thy might  \nRama speeds on wings of vengeance Lanka\'s impious lord to smite!"\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book IX: The Council of War](rama09.htm)\n\n'
