I know my wife is dead,  \nAnd giants on her limbs have fed,  \nSo strange, so terrible are all  \nThe omens which my heart appal.  \nO Lakshman, may we yet return  \nThe safety of my love to learn.  \nTo find the child of Janak still  \nAlive and free from scathe and ill!  \nEach bird with notes of warning screams,  \n\nThough the hot sun still darts his beams.  \nThe moan of deer, the jackal's yell  \nOf some o'erwhelming misery tell.  \nO mighty brother, still may she.  \nMy princess, live from danger free!  \nThat semblance of a golden deer  \n     Allured me far away,  \n   I followed nearer and more near,  \n     And longed to take the prey.  \n   I followed where the quarry fled:  \n     My deadly arrow flew,  \n   And as the dying creature bled,  \n     The giant met my view.  \n   Great tear and pain oppress my heart  \n     That dreads the coming blow,  \n   And through my left eye keenly dart  \n     The throbs that herald woe.  \n   Ah Lakshman, all these signs dismay,  \n     My soul that sinks, with dread,  \n   I know my love is torn away,  \n     Or, haply, she is dead.'  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LIX.: Rama's Return.](ry257.htm)\n\n"
