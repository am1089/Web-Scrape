Vyasa said :-- O king! On seeing Vi _sn_ u killing his wife, and thus\ncommitting a dreadful atrocious act, the Bhagavan Bhrigu was very sorry and\nbegan to tremble with anger and addressed Madhusudana thus.\n\n\n\n2\\. Bhrigu said :-- O Vi _sn_ u! You have done an extremely sinful act. O\nintelligent one! Knowing it, you have done so; what a great wonder! Nobody\ndreams of the murder of this Brahma _n_ \xc2\x92s daughter; and you have committed it\nin deed, black and white.\n\n\n\n3\\. O Deva! The Mahar _s_ is declare you to be Sattvic, engaged in\npreservation; Brahma to be Rajasic (creator) and S\xc2\x92ambhu S\xc2\x92iva to be Tamasic\n(destroyer). Why then is the contrary thing visible in this case?\n\n\n\n4\\. Why have you become Tamasic? Why have you done this heinous crime? O Vi\n_sn_ u! The females are never to be killed; this is a known fact; then why\nhave you killed this woman without any fault.\n\n\n\np. 291\n\n\n\n5-6. You have done a very execrable act. What shall I do to you? It is mete\nthat I would curse you. O Great Sinner! You have pained me very much and made\nme very weary. I will not curse Indra. You always assume a deceitful\nappearance and behave like a black cruel serpent; your mind is all full of\nwickedness; I will curse you.\n\n\n\n7\\. O Janardana. Those Munis who call you Sattvic are fools; I have seen today\nthat your ways are exceptionally vicious and Tamasic.\n\n\n\n8\\. O Vi _sn_ u! I curse you now to take frequent births, suffer very\nfrequently in different wombs, in the earth and thus suffer the pains of\nremaining in the wombs.\n\n\n\n9\\. O king! Therefore whenever religion subsides in the world, Bhagavan Vi\n_sn_ u incarnates frequently in this human world, due to the curse of Bhrigu.\n\n\n\n10\\. The king said :-- O best of the Munis! Did that Mahatma Bhrigu again\nmarry and lead a householder\xc2\x92s life when his wife was thus killed by the\nlustrous disc Sudars\xc2\x92ana.\n\n\n\n11\\. Vyasa said :-- O king! The sacrificer Bhrigu angrily cursed Hari and next\ntook that severed head and quickly placed it over the body as before and said\n:--\n\n\n\n12-14. O Devi! Vi _sn_ u has slain you today; I will make you regain your life\njust now. If I am acquainted with all the Dharmas and if I have practised\nthese in my life and if I have spoken truth always, then dost thou regain your\nlife by my religious merit. Let all the Devas witness my power and strength.\nIf I know the True, if I have studied all the Vedas and if I have realised the\nKnowledge of the Vedas, then I, sprinkling your body with this cold water,\ncharged with my mantras, will revive you.\n\n\n\n15\\. Vyasa said :-- O king! Sprinkled by the water by Bhrigu, his wife\nregained her life and rose up at once and felt herself glad and smiled.\n\n\n\n16\\. All the persons and living creatures seeing her stand, as if awoken from\nher sleep, at once exclaimed from all sides \xc2\x93well done, well done!\xc2\x94 thanked\nBhrigu and his wife very much and highly praised them.\n\n\n\n17\\. Thus seeing the fair complexioned wife regain her life through Bhrigu,\nIndra and all the Devas were very much struck with wonder.\n\n\n\nNOTE :-- Thought power and inhalation of some medicines might have revived\nher.\n\n\n\n18\\. Indra then adressed the Devas :-- Now the mother of S\xc2\x92ukra has regained\nher life through Bhrigu; but when S\xc2\x92ukracharya will receive the mantra after\nhis severe tapasya, we do not know what terrible harm; he would do to us!\n\n\n\n19\\. Vyasa said :-- O king! Though the deep sleep that overtook Indra had now\nleft him, yet he became very unhappy, remembering the severe asceticism of\nS\xc2\x92ukra\xc2\x92s tapasya and his receiving mantras.\n\n\n\np. 292\n\n\n\n20\\. Thinking over deeply in his mind, Indra called his daughter Jayanti and\nspoke to her with affection.\n\n\n\n21-22. Go! Daughter! I have given thee over to the ascetic Kavya. Do this\nservice for me, go to Kavya and help him in his asceticism and bring him under\nyour control. By whatever acts the Muni be pleased, dost thou do at once and\nplease him in every way and thus remove my fear.\n\n\n\n23\\. The large-eyed beautiful Jayanti, hearing her father\xc2\x92s words, went to the\nhermitage and there saw the Ri _s_ i inhaling or drinking the smoke.\n\n\n\n24\\. On seeing the body of the ascetic, and remembering her father\xc2\x92s words she\nbrought the leaves of the plantain trees and began to fan him.\n\n\n\n25\\. The intelligent Jayanti with no excitement used to bring the pure, clear,\ncool, and well scented water and place it, with great devotion, before the\nsage for his drinking.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Here Indra bribed by giving away his daughter.\n\n\n\n26\\. When the sun was over his head, she used to prepare some protection, with\nher clothes, from the sun and thus made the shade for him. Thus, in various\nways, did she begin to serve the Muni, herself remaining steady in her\nreligion.\n\n\n\n27\\. She brought sweet and ripe fruits proper according to the S\xc2\x92astras and\nused to place them before him for his repast.\n\n\n\n28\\. In the performance of his daily duties, she used to collect the Kus\xc2\x92a\ngrass of the span of thumb and fore finger, and flowers, white and yellow and\nplaced them before him.\n\n\n\n29\\. For the Muni\xc2\x92s bedding to lie down and sleep, she used to gather soft,\ngreen leaves and with them she used to keep his bed ready; and when the Muni\nlaid himself down, she used to fan him gently.\n\n\n\n30\\. Never did she exhibit for fear of curse, any gesture or posture\ncalculated to disturb his mind.\n\n\n\n31\\. The sweet-tongued, thin lady used to praise S\xc2\x92ukracharya in pleasing and\nfavourable terms.\n\n\n\n32\\. When the Muni awoke, she placed water before him to wash his face and\nhands. Thus serving the Muni, did she stay in the hermitage.\n\n\n\n33\\. The fear stricken Indra used to send messengers to fathom the mind of\nthat self controlled Muni.\n\n\n\n34\\. Thus did Jayanti serve for good many years the Muni, being void of anger\nand observing duly her celibacy.\n\n\n\n35\\. In this way one thousand years passed duly, the God Mahadeva was very\npleased and addressed S\xc2\x92ukracharya that He had come to give him boons that he\ndesire.\n\n\n\np. 293\n\n\n\n36-37. The God Mahadeva said :-- Whatever there exists in this universe,\nwhatever you see with your eyes and whatever cannot be described in words, you\nwill be the lord of all these and the conqueror of all. There is no doubt in\nthis. You cannot be killed by any creature; you will be the ruler of all\nbeings and will be reckoned as the best of the Brahma _n_ as.\n\n\n\n38-39. Vyasa said :-- The God Mahadeva disappeared then and there, after\ngranting him the boons. Then S\xc2\x92ukracharya saw Jayanti and said to her :-- O\nlady of beautiful hips! Who and whose daughter art thou? What is the desire in\nyour mind? What for you have come here? O one of beautiful thighs! what is\nyour duty?\n\n\n\n40\\. O beautiful eyed! I am very pleased with all that you have done for me.\nWhat do you want? O one of good vows! Ask boons from me; I will grant them\neven if they be difficult.\n\n\n\n41\\. On hearing this, Jayanti\xc2\x92s face became bright with joy; she said :--\nwhatever I desire, you know that already by force of your Tapasya.\n\n\n\n42\\. The Kavya said :-- Your mental desires I know; still mention them\nyourself particularly; I will do good to you in any way you like; I am pleased\nwith your services.\n\n\n\n43-44. Jayanti said :-- O Brahmi _n_! I am the daughter of Indra and I am the\nyounger of my brother Jayanta. Father has given me over to you; I now like to\nlive with you. Kindly fulfil my desires now. O blessed one! You better take me\nand enjoy me according to Dharma. This is my desire.\n\n\n\n45\\. S\xc2\x92ukracharya said :-- O thou of large and handsome hips! Better enjoy\nwith me for ten years, according to your liking, without being visible to\nanybody.\n\n\n\n46-48. Vyasa said :-- Thus saying, S\xc2\x92ukracharya went to his home and,\naccording to religious observances, married Jayanti and lived with her for ten\nyears under the shade of Maya and unobserved by anybody. On the other hand,\nthe Daityas, hearing that S\xc2\x92ukracharya returned home successful getting his\ndesired Mantra, were very glad and went to his house to pay their respects to\nhim. But S\xc2\x92ukra was then living with Jayanti; hence the Asuras could not see\nhim.\n\n\n\n49\\. Then they got very much dejected, sorry and were drooped in spirits; they\nsearched for him again and again.\n\n\n\n50\\. Not being able to see S\xc2\x92ukra under the shade of Maya, the Daityas were\nvery sorry and got afraid and then returned to their own residences.\n\n\n\n51\\. On the other hand, the Devas, knowing that S\xc2\x92ukra was holding\nintercourses with Jayanti, Indra, the God of Devas, spoke to the Deva Guru\n\n\n\np. 294\n\n\n\nBrihaspati. O Guru! Advise us what to do under the present circumstances and\nrelieve us from the impending difficulties.\n\n\n\n52\\. O Brahma _n_ a. Better go today to the Danavas and do that by which our\nhonour may be maintained. You better put the Danavas under some charm by your\nmagical spell and think and do good to us.\n\n\n\n53\\. On hearing Indra\xc2\x92s words and knowing that S\xc2\x92ukra is now enjoying with\nJayanti, Brihaspati went to the Danavas, putting on the appearance of\nS\xc2\x92ukracharya.\n\n\n\n54\\. Going to the Demons, he called on them very politely and sweetly. The\nAsuras said that S\xc2\x92ukracharya had come in presence of them.\n\n\n\n55\\. The Demons were very glad and bowed down before S\xc2\x92ukracharya and could\nnot make out that he was the false S\xc2\x92ukracharya, under the mayic charm of\nBrihaspati.\n\n\n\n56\\. Then the false S\xc2\x92ukracharya asked the welfare of the Daityas and said :--\nI went so long for your good; I performed severe tapasya and satisfied the God\nS\xc2\x92ambhu and acquired from him the Mantra, the sacred knowledge, and that I\nwill frankly explain to you.\n\n\n\n57\\. On hearing this, the Demons were very pleased and, knowing that the Guru\nhad been successful, were filled with joy.\n\n\n\n58\\. They saluted him with joy and began to live quietly and freely and\nwithout pains, having got rid of fear from the Devas.\n\n\n\nHere ends the twelfth Chapter in the Fourth Book of S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam,\nthe Mahapura _n_ am of 18,000 verses by Maharsi Veda Vyasa on Bhrigu\xc2\x92s curse\nand the dialogue between S\xc2\x92ukracharya and the Daityas.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 13](bk04ch13.htm)\n\n'
