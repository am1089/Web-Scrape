Now follow the penances.\n\n2\\. Let a man fast for three days;\n\n3\\. And let him perform each day the three ablutions (at dawn, noon, and\nsunset);\n\n4\\. And let him, at every ablution, plunge into the water three times;\n\n5\\. And let him mutter the Aghamarsha _n_ a three times, after having plunged\ninto the water;\n\n6\\. During day-time let him be standing;\n\n7\\. At night let him continue in a sitting position;\n\n8\\. At the close of the ceremony let him give a milch cow (to a Brahma _n_ a).\n\n9\\. Thus[1] has the penance Aghamarsha _n_ a been described.\n\n[XLVI. 10, 11, 18, 19. M. XI, 212, 213, 215, 216.--10, 11, 13, 18-20, 22, 23.\nY. III, 315-323.--10. \xc3\x82past. I, 9, 27, 7.--10, 11, 13. Gaut. XXIII, 2; XXVI,\n1-5, 20.--24, 25. M. XI, 224, 225.\n\n9\\. 1 Nand. thinks that the word iti, 'thus,' has a double meaning {footnote\np. 150} here, and refers to another kind of Aghamarshana penance at the same\ntime, which is described by _S_ a _n_ kha, and consists simply in fasting for\nthree days and muttering the Aghamarsha _n_ a hymn three times.]\n\np. 150\n\n10\\. Let a man for three days eat in the evening only; for other three days,\nin the morning only; for further three days, food (given to him) unsolicited;\n(and let him fast entirely for three days): that is the Pra _g_ apatya (the\npenance invented by Pra _g_ apati).\n\n11\\. Let him drink for three days hot water; for other three days, hot\nclarified butter; and for further three days, hot milk; and let him fast for\nthree days: that is the Taptak _rikkh_ ra (hot penance).\n\n12\\. Taking the same (liquids) cold is called the _S_ itak _rikkh_ ra (cold\npenance).\n\n13\\. The K _rikkh_ ratik _rikkh_ ra (the most difficult penance) consists in\nsubsisting on milk only for twenty-one days.\n\n14\\. Eating (nothing but) ground barley mixed with water for a whole month is\ncalled the Udakak _rikkh_ ra (water penance).\n\n15\\. Eating nothing but lotus-fibres (for a whole month) is called the Mulak\n_rikkh_ ra (root penance).\n\n16\\. Eating nothing but Bel fruit (for a whole month) is called the _S_\nriphalak _rikkh_ ra (Bel fruit penance).\n\n17\\. Or[1] (this penance is performed) by (eating) lotus-seeds.\n\n18\\. A total fast for twelve days is called Paraka.\n\n19\\. Subsisting for one day on the urine and faeces of a cow, milk, sour milk,\nbutter, and water\n\n[17. 1 According to Nand., the particle va, 'or,' here indicates another\nalternative, that of performing this penance with \xc3\x82malakas (Emblica\nOfficinalis Gaertn.)]\n\np. 151\n\nin which Ku _s_ a grass has been boiled, and fasting the next day, is called\nSantapana (the tormenting penance).\n\n20\\. Swallowing (the same six things, viz.) cow-urine and the rest, each for\none day, is called Mahasantapana (the particularly tormenting penance).\n\n21\\. Swallowing each for three days is called Atisantapana (the extremely\ntormenting penance).\n\n22\\. Swallowing oil-cakes, foam of boiled rice, buttermilk, water, and ground\nbarley (each for one day), with a fasting day between (every, two days), is\ncalled Tulapurusha (a man's weight).\n\n23\\. Drinking water boiled with Kusa grass, leaves of the Palasa and Udumbara\ntrees, of lotuses, of the _S_ a _n_ khapushpi plant, of the banyan tree, and\nof the Brahmasuvar _k_ ala plant, each (for one day), is called Par _n_ ak\n_rikkh_ ra (leaves penance).\n\n24\\. Let a man perform all those penances after having shorn his hair and his\nbeard, and let him bathe at morning, noon, and evening every day, lying on a\nlow couch, and restraining his passions,\n\n25\\. And let him (while engaged in performing them) avoid to converse with\nwomen, _S_ udras, or outcasts, and let him constantly, to the best of his\nability, mutter purifying Ma _n_ tras and make oblations in the fire.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XLVII.](sbe07049.htm)\n\n"
