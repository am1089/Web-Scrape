In the generation of Bruhmu was first\nKusyp, whose son Hirunkusyp was very mighty and renowned; and became immortal.\nHis son Hurijun, a worshipper of Krishnu, was named Purladh, whose son was\nRaja Biroochun, and Biroochun\'s son the Raja Bul, whose fame and excellence\nare still spread abroad on the earth. When Krishnu descended upon the earth in\nthe form of a dwarf, he having practised a stratagem sent Raja Bul to the\ninfernal regions. The eldest Sal of that Bul was Banasoor; a very potent and\nsplendid monarch, he dwelt in Shronitpore, and went constantly to the mountain\nKuelas to perform adoration to Shivu; he cherished the profession of brahmins,\nspoke the truth, and lived with his passions in complete subjection.\n\nO great king! Banasoor having gone to the hill Kuelas, and performed adoration\nto Huri; and being absorbed in an intense feeling of affection, began in a\nstate of ecstacy to play upon the\n\np. 295\n\nhand-drum and dance and sing. Hearing him sing and play, Shree Muhadeo\nBholanath was delighted, and began to dance with Parbutee, and play upon a\nhand-drum. After dancing for some time, Muhadeo was highly pleased; and having\ncalled Banasoor to him said, "Son! I have been highly gratified with your\nsinging and dancing, ask a boon from me, and I will grant whatever you ask;\nyou have played most agreeably, and my mind has been rejoiced at hearing you."\n\nOn hearing these words, O great king! Banasoor, joining his hands and bending\nhis head, said, with the greatest humility, "O lord of compassion! you have\nshown me great favour in promising me a boon, I solicit that you will first\nmake me immortal, and confer on me the sovereignty of the whole world, and\nafterwards make me so powerful that no one will obtain a victory over me."\nMuhadeo Jee replied, "I grant you this boon, and release you from all fear; in\nthe three worlds no one shall have power equal to yours; and, even Bruhmu\nshall have no authority over you: you have played excellent music, and\nafforded me extreme gratification, being greatly rejoiced in mind, I have\nbestowed upon you a thousand arms, go home now, and, free from all anxiety,\nexercise a sovereignty, which cannot be shaken."\n\nBanasoor, O great king ! having heard this speech of Bholanath, and, having\nreceived a thousand arms, was highly delighted; and, going to the right, by\nway of adoration, and bowing his head, took leave, and dwelt by permission at\nShronitpore, afterwards having conquered the three worlds, and having brought\nall the gods under subjection, he dug a broad deep ditch with water, springing\nat the bottom, and built castles of fire and air; being free from all dread or\nfear of any one, he began to carry on his government happily; after the lapse\nof some time his arms, in consequence of his not fighting, became very strong:\nhe rubbed them and shook them about. Banasoor said to himself, "With whom\nshall I fight, on whom shall I make an attack? I have become infected with\nitch in\n\np. 296\n\nconsequence of not fighting, who will fulfil the desires of my mind?"\n\nHaving thus spoken, Banasoor went outside his house, and began to root up\nhills, and dash them to pieces, and wander about different countries. When he\nhad destroyed all the hills, and the irritation and itching of his hands had\nnot left him, Banasoor said, "With whom shall I now fight, and what shall I do\nwith so many arms? How shall I support the huge weight of my own strength, I\nwill go again to Muhadeo, and speak to him on the subject."\n\nO great king! Banasoor, having thus reflected, went into the presence of\nMuhadeo Jee, and, joining his hands and bowing his head said, "O lord of the\nthree worlds! in whose hand is the trident, you did me the kindness to bestow\nupon me a thousand arms, which I find too heavy for my body, I cannot support\nthe weight of them, be pleased to remedy this, and point out some one\npossessed of great strength with whom I may fight, I cannot find any one in\nthe three worlds so powerful as to face me in an encounter; as you have,\nthrough compassion, bestowed on me great strength, do me the kindness now to\nfight with me and satisfy the yearnings of my mind, or else point out some\nother very strong being with whom I may contend, and dissipate the troubles of\nmy mind."\n\nHaving narrated thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great\nking! Muhadeo Jee was angry at hearing Banasoor, thus address him, and began\nto say himself, "I granted him a boon, thinking him a holy man, and now he is\nready to fight with me; this fool has become proud of his strength and shall\nnot escape with life; he who indulges in pride never lives long." Muhadeo\nhaving these thoughts in his mind, said, "Banasoor! do not distress yourself,\nin a short time a fit antagonist for you, Shree Krishnu, will descend upon the\nearth in the family of Judoo, with exception of him there is no one in the\nthree worlds who can contend\n\np. 297\n\nwith you." Banasoor was very much pleased when he heard this, and said, "Lord!\nwhen will that man descend upon the earth, and how shall I know that he has\nbeen born?" Raja Shivu presenting Banasoor with a banner, said to him, "Take\nthis flag and place it on the top of your house, and when this flag shall fall\nof itself and be broken to pieces, then know that your enemy is born."\n\nWhen Muhadeo, O great king! had thus explained to him, Banasoor took the flag\nand returned home. On arriving there, he fixed the flag upon his house, and\ndaily offered up prayers that the man might appear, with whom he could fight.\nWhen some time had elapsed, his chief queen, named Banawutee, became pregnant,\nand when her time was completed, brought forth a girl; on that occasion\nBanasoor having sent for astrologers, and given them seats, said, "Fix upon\nthe name, and point out the mental qualities of this girl." When he had thus\nspoken, the astrologers determined quickly upon the year, month, half month,\nlunar day, day of the week, hour, division of time equal to forty-eight\nminutes and the twenty-seventh division of the zodiack; and, having considered\nthe proper moment, named the girl "Ookha," and said, "O great king! this girl\nwill be a mine of beauty, and good qualities of mind and disposition; and will\nbe very intelligent; we can discover this from her planet and other signs."\n\nBanasoor was highly gratified at hearing this; and, having bestowed many gifts\nupon the astrologers, allowed them to take leave; and afterwards, having sent\nfor singers and dancers and musicians, gave a festive entertainment. As the\ngirl grew up, Banasoor treated her with the greatest affection. When Ookha was\nseven years of age, her father, Banasoor, sent her to the mountain Kuelas,\nwhich is near Shronitpore, with many attendants and companions to Shivu and\nParbutee, for the purpose of learning to read. Ookha, having propitiated\nGuneshu and Suroswutee, went into the presence of Shivu and Parbutee; and,\nhaving joined her hands and bending her head,\n\np. 298\n\nthus submissively spoke: "O seas of compassion! Shivu and Devee, grant me,\nyour servant, the gift of knowledge, and acquire for yourselves renown in the\nworld by so doing." O great king! Shivu and Parbutee, being pleased with the\nhumility of Ookha\'s speech, began to impart knowledge to her; she went\nconstantly to them for the purpose of reading; and after some time had been\nthus spent, she read all the Shastrus; and became very proficient in\nknowledge, and played upon all kinds of musical instruments. One day Ookha\nplayed a duet with Parbutee on the lute, and sang scientifically, when Shivu\nJee came and said to Parbutee, "Beloved! Shree Krishnu Chund has restored to\nlife Kamdeo, whom I burnt to death." Having thus spoken, Shree Muhadeo went to\nthe banks of the Ganges with Parbutee, and bathing both himself and her,\nbecame very amorous, and began to assist Parbutee in dressing with great\naffection of manner, and to make love to her. At length, in the ecstasy of his\npassion, he began to play upon a hand-drum, and dance frantically with violent\ngesticulation, singing according to the science of music, explained in the\nShastrus, and fondly embracing his wife. Ookha, beholding the mutual joy and\nfondness of Shivu and Parbutee, and feeling a desire to have a husband, began\nto say to herself, "If I had a husband, I would enjoy amorous diversion with\nhim, in the manner of Shivu and Parbutee. A woman without a husband is as\ndefective in beauty as night without the moon."\n\nWhen, O great king! Ookha had thus expressed her thoughts to herself, Shree\nParbutee, acquainted with the secrets of the heart, knowing her thoughts,\ninvited her with the greatest affection to come near, and thus with the most\ntender regard addressed her, "Daughter! suffer not any anxiety of mine, thou\nshalt obtain a husband in a dream; search for him and enjoy amorous pleasure\nwith him." Having thus given her a bridegroom, the wife of Shivu allowed Ookha\nto take leave. Having attained a great proficiency in knowledge, and received\na promise of a husband, she made a salutation, and\n\np. 299\n\nwent to her father; who gave her a very beautiful house, apart from all\nothers, to live in. And she, taking with her several of her friends and\ncompanions, lived there, and increased in stature daily.\n\nO great king! when the young maiden had reached the age of twelve years, the\nfull moon hid its diminished rays on beholding the lustre of her moon-like\ncountenance; compared with the blackness of her hair, the darkness of the\nnight at the change of the moon seemed trifling. On seeing her taper locks,\nsnakes cast their skins and fled away; the bow began to palpitate, on\nbeholding the arch of her eye-brows; deer, fishes and wagtails were abashed at\nthe sight of her large and rolling eyes; the sesamum withered on gazing at the\nelegance of her nose; the fruit of the binba tree was restless at the redness\nof her lips; the breast of the pomegranate was lacerated, on viewing the\nregularity of her teeth; the rose ceased to blow when she saw the softness of\nher cheeks; pigeons were fidgetty at the roundness of her neck; on taking a\nside view of her breasts, the buds of the lotus fell into the tank; the\nlioness retired into the forest when she saw her slim waist; the plantain ate\ncamphor on beholding the smoothness of her thighs; gold was abashed at the\nfairness of her body, and the chumpa hid itself; the lotus lost all its\nestimation in comparison with her hands and feet. \'Such was she, with the gait\nof an elephant, the voice of a kokila, and in the very flower of youth and\nbeauty, and by the splendour of her charms eclipsed all the abovementioned.\n\nOn a subsequent day, the maiden, having applied perfumes and paste, and bathed\nand rubbed herself in pure water, combed her hair, and divided it, and\nfastening pearls where the hair is divided, made use of antimony and tooth-\npowder, and stained herself with " _mehadu_ " and " _lac_ ;" and, having eaten\npawn and decked herself out in all kinds of jewels and ornaments\' wearing an\nelegant, brilliant petticoat, with a border of large pearls, and a cloth round\nher body with a hem of great splendour,\n\np. 300\n\na shining boddice, and a sparkling and perfumed veil, came forth thus adorned\nand smiling with her female companions and attendants like Luchmee, and\nsaluted her parents. When Ookha stood before them after having made a\nsalutation, Banasoor, on beholding the splendour of her beauty, allowed her to\ntake leave, with this thought in his mind, "That she was now of a fit age to\nbe married;" and he afterwards sent many male demons to guard her house, and\nmany females for the protection of her person; the male demons exercised the\ngreatest vigilance night and day, and the females were in constant attendance\nupon her.\n\nO great king! the royal .maiden constantly performed penance, bestowed gifts,\nfasted and offered adoration to Shree Parbutee Jee for a husband; saying,\n"When will my father celebrate my marriage, and how shall I obtain a husband?"\nHaving thus said, she went to sleep, thinking of a husband, and beheld in a\ndream a being of a childish appearance, black colour, a moon-like countenance,\nlotus eyes, very beautiful and Cupid-like, with an enchanting face, dressed in\nyellow silk, wearing a peacock crown on his head, standing awry, decked out\nwith ornaments and jewels, wearing ear-rings in the shape of an alligator, a\ngarland reaching to his feet, and also one of the " _goonja_ " seed, and very\nwanton looking and playful. On seeing him, she blushed and held down her head.\nHe then addressed her in the language of love, and approached her in an\naffectionate manner, and laying hold of her hand and embracing her, made her\nforget all her anxious and perplexing thoughts. Having both got rid of this\nreserve and hesitation, they sat upon the bed, and engaging in amorous\ndalliance and glances,  and kissing and embracing each other, they\nreciprocated pleasure, and in a delighted excitement of mind, addressed each\nother in the accents of love. After some time, when Ookha, in the midst of her\naffection, desired to embrace her husband in her arms, she awoke from sleep,\nand disappointed and sad, remained fixed in the position she had assumed with\nher arms\n\np. 301\n\nextended for the embrace. She was very sorrowful on waking and greatly\ngrieved; "Where has he gone, the lord of my soul?" She continued to search for\nhim in every direction. She thought to herself, "How shall I meet him again,\nand how shall I see him? If I had continued sleeping, my beloved would. never\nhave gone away? Why should I have been on the point of embracing him, when my\nsleep was disturbed, when I awoke, the night seemed very tedious, why did he\ninflict misery on me by departing? Without my beloved my soul is very\nwretched, whilst not beholding him, my eyes long for his presence. My ears\ndesire anxiously to hear him speak. Where has my beloved gone, the bestower of\npleasure? If I again behold my darling in a dream, I will resign my life to\nhim."\n\nO great king! having thus spoken, Ookha was very sad, and thinking upon her\nhusband, sat down upon her bed with her face buried in her hands; when night\nwas succeeded by morning, and about four hours and a half of the day had\npassed, her female friends and attendants began to say to each other, What has\nhappened to Ookha, that she has not yet risen from sleep, although the day is\nso far advanced?" Having heard this remark, Chitrekha, the daughter of\nBanasoor\'s minister, Rookbhano, went to the picture gallery, and beheld Ookha,\nlying dejected and motionless on her curtained bed, shedding tears and heaving\nlong drawn sighs. On seeing her in this state, Chitrekha said to her with\ngreat emotion, "Explain, my dear, to me, why you are so sad to-day, and have\nfallen into such a sea of affliction? You are weeping and sighing; why is your\nmind so disturbed? I will drive away all your griefs, and will do for you\nwhatever you wish. You have no friend so attached as me, nor one who has a\ngreater affection for you. I will wander over all the three worlds to\naccomplish what you desire. Bruhmu has granted me a boon, and subjected all to\nmy authority. Devee will assist me; and, by means of her power I will do\nwhatever you may tell me. Look upon me as possessed of\n\np. 302\n\nsuch power of enchantment, as to be able to deceive and bring here Bruhmu,\nRoodru and Indru. No one knows the secrets of my nature, I therefore, myself\nexplain my own attributes. No one, whosoever he be, whether good or bad, can\nspeak with the same knowledge of them as I can; mention all your distresses to\nme; what has happened during the night? Do not deceive me, O beloved! and I\nwill bring about all you hope for."\n\nOn hearing these words, O great king! Ookha was very much ashamed, and with\nher head drooping, approached Chitrekha, and said to her, in a sweet tone of\nvoice, "O beloved! knowing you to be my friend, I will mention all that\noccurred during the night, keep the affair a secret; and if you can apply a\nremedy, do so. During the night, in a dream, a being of the colour of the\nclouds, a figure brilliant as the moon, with lotus-like eyes, dressed in\nyellow silk, and with a scarf of the same colour, came and sat near me, and\ndisplaying great affection for me, captivated my mind; so that I lost all\nreserve and bashfulness, and conversed with him; at length when the\nconversation had continued for some time, and in the eagerness of passion, I\nextended my arms to lay hold of him, I was awakened from sleep, and his\nfascinating form remained imprinted on my mind; I have never heard of nor seen\nany one like him. How shall I attempt to give you a description, his beauty\nexceeds the power of language. He has stolen away my affections. When I used\nto go to the mountain Kuelas to acquire knowledge, under the tuition of Shree\nMuhadeo Jee, Shree Parbutee told me, that I should see my husband in a dream,\nand that I ought to cause search to be made for him. I saw that bridegroom\nlast night in a dream; where shall I find him again, and to whom shall I\nreveal the pangs of separation I endure? Whither shall I go, how shall I\nsearch for him, not knowing either his name or place of abode?"\n\nO great king! when Ookha having thus spoken, and heaved long drawn sighs,\ndrooped and pined in thought, Chitrekha said\n\np. 303\n\nto her, "Be not at all anxious, my dear; I will search out your husband\nwherever he may be, and bring him to you. I have access to the three worlds;\nwherever he may be I will try and find him out for you. Tell me his name, and\nallow me permission to start." Ookha replied, "Friend! there is a proverb, he\nis dead, because he cannot breathe. If I knew his name and residence why\nshould I be sad; could I not apply some remedy to my distress?" Chitrekha\nreplied, "Never mind, dear, about not knowing his name and residence, I will\nwrite down and point out to you all the male inhabitants of the three worlds;\namongst whom, show me him, who has stolen your heart, and it will be my\nbusiness to bring him to you." Ookha laughed and assented.\n\nO great king! when Chitrekha had obtained Ookha\'s consent, she sent for\nwriting materials, and sat down upon the ground; and, having propitiated\nGuneshu and Devee, and meditated upon her spiritual preceptor, began to write.\nShe first wrote and showed her a description of the three worlds with their\neight divisions, and fourteen sub-divisions, the seven islands, the nine\ndivisions of the earth, the sky, the seven seas, and Vishnu\'s celestial\nparadise. Afterwards Chitrekha showed her a description of the gods, demons,\ncelestial musicians, choristers, demi-gods, saints, sages, the supporters of\nthe world, the supporters of the ten quarters and the Rajas of all countries.\nBut Ookha did not find her beloved amongst them. After this, Chitrekha drew\nseparate likenesses of the descendants of Judoo; and when she showed them to\nOokha, Ookha said on beholding Unroodru\'s picture, "I have found him, who\nstole my heart, this is he, who came to me in the night. Arrange some plan\nnow, friend, and search him out, and bring him here." On hearing this,\nChitrekha replied, "How shall he escape me?" [Chitrekha](errata.htm#16)\nproceeded to say, "O friend! you do not know him, but I can tell you who he\nis, he is of the family of Judoo, and a grandson of Shree Krishnu Chund, and\nthe son of Purdiyomun; his name is Unroodru. He lives at\n\np. 304\n\n[paragraph continues] Dwarka, a city built in the sea near the shore. By order\nof Huri, the quoit, Soodursun, keeps constant watch over that city in order\nthat no devil, demon nor wicked person may annoy the descendants of Judoo, and\nif any such come to the city, he cannot obtain entrance without the permission\nof Rajas Oogursen and Soorsen."\n\nO great king! Ookha was very sad at these words, and said, "O friend! if it be\na place so difficult of access, how will you go there and bring my husband\nthence?" Chitrekha replied, "My dear! set your mind at rest on that point; by\nthe glorious grace of Huri, I will bring your soul\'s lord to you." Having thus\nspoken, Chitrekha put on garments, imprinted all over with the name of Ramu,\nand made marks and perpendicular lines on her forehead with sandal wood, such\nas cowherdesses wear, and stamped impressions of different kinds on her\nbreasts, the upper part of her arms and throat, and wearing a large garland of\ntoolsee on her neck, and carrying rosaries of the large diamonds of the\ntoolsee in her hand, throwing over herself a chequered blanket, she folded\nunder her arm a cloth to sit upon and assuming the appearance of a chief\nworshipper of Vishnu, she made an obeisance and started for Dwarka, taking\nleave of Ookha, and saying to her, "I will proceed through the air, and pursue\nmy journey in the sky, I will bring thy husband, otherwise my name is not\nChitrekha."\n\nHaving recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said, O great\nking! Chitrekha, having brought into play her delusive power, and mounting on\na horse of air, started on a dark night in company with a black cloud; and\nhaving arrived almost instantaneously at the city of Dwarka, shone forth like\nlightning and entered the dwelling of Shree Krishnu Chund, in such a manner\nthat no one knew of her coming. Prosecuting her search, she came to where\nUnroodru sleeping alone on a bed, was diverting himself in a dream with Ookha.\nOn beholding this, she quickly took up the sleeper\'s bed, and\n\np. 305\n\nwent off with it. She carried off the sleeper and his bed on Ookha\'s account,\nand brought Unroodru to the place, where Ookha was sitting thoughtful.\n\nO great king! on seeing Unroodru and his bed, Ookha was  at first in a great\nflutter, and went and fell at the feet of Chitrekha, she afterwards began to\nspeak in terms of the highest praise of her courage and prowess, for having\ngone to a place of such difficult access, and having brought him away, bed and\nall; and thereby having done what she agreed to do, "For my sake thou hast\nundergone all this trouble; I am not able to make a fitting return, but must\nremain a debtor to your goodness." Chitrekha replied, "In the world it is a\nvery pleasant thing to contribute to the happiness of others; and it is a good\nact to assist them; this body is of no use with reference to our own selfish\nadvantages, but it is very useful, if it can be made to promote the benefit of\nothers. By such conduct our own objects and the objects of others are\naccomplished."\n\nO great king! having thus spoken, Chitrekha took leave, and went home, saying,\n"Friend! by the glorious favour of Bhugwan I have brought thy husband to thee,\nawake him now and satisfy thy desires." On the departure of Chitrekha the\ndelighted Ookha was ashamed and afraid of the first interview, and began to\nsay to herself, "What shall I say to awaken my husband, and how shalt I\nembrace him in my arms?" At length she began to play sweet notes on her lute,\non hearing the sound of which Unroodru awoke; and, looking round on all sides,\nbegan to say to himself, "What place is this and whose house; how did I come\nhere, and who has brought me here with my bed, while asleep?"\n\nO great king! Unroodru was in a state of great astonishment, uttering many\nexpressions of surprise; whilst Ookha, thoughtful and abashed, fearful of the\nfirst interview, standing in a corner, and gazing on the countenance of her\nbeloved, feasted her partridge-like eyes. In the mean while, Unroodru, on\nseeing her,\n\np. 306\n\nwas confused, and said, "Tell me, fair one, thy history, who art thou, whence\nhast thou come to me; or hast thou brought me here thyself? Look not upon\ntruth and falsehood as the same; at present I see every thing as in a dream."\n\nO great king! Ookha made no reply to this speech, but became more ashamed, and\ncrept into the corner; upon this he immediately laid hold of her by the hand,\nand seated her upon his bed; and, addressing her in the language of affection,\ndispelled all her anxiety and shame, and alarm; they sat together on the bed\nand began to exchange amorous glances, and engage in loving dalliance, and\nrelate the history of their love. In the course of conversation Unroodru Jee\nenquired from Ookha, "How didst thou, O beautiful creature! first see me, and\nafterwards have me brought here? Explain the circumstances fully to me, that\nmy doubts may be all removed?" On hearing this Ookha, gazing with delight on\nthe face of her husband, said, "You came to me in a dream, and stole away my\naffections; on awaking my mind was greatly troubled, and I mentioned the\nsubject to Chitrekha, who, O lord! has brought you here, and whose proceedings\nI do not know." Afterwards Ookha said, "O great king! I have mentioned how I\nfirst saw, and have since found, you; be pleased now, O lord of the Judoos! to\nexplain how you first saw me." Unroodru was highly delighted at this request,\nand replied, smiling, "O beauteous fair! I also saw thee in a dream last\nnight, and some one took me up in my sleep and brought me here. I have not yet\ndiscovered who it was, and, on awaking, I beheld thee."\n\nHaving recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great\nking! the two lovers conversed thus with each other; and in the fervour of\ntheir affection, indulged in all kinds of voluptuous pleasure and dalliance,\nand vanished all recollection of the pangs of separation they had endured;\nsubsequently when Ookha found the taste of pawn insipid, the pearl necklace\ncold to the touch, and the light of the lamp dim, and went\n\np. 307\n\noutside, she perceived that it was morning. The light of the moon was\ndiminished, the splendour of the stars dimmed, and there was a dark, red\ncolour in the sky. The birds were chirping on all sides, the white esculent\nlotus was withered, and the other lotus blooming, the red goose and its mate\nwere together.\n\nO great king! observing this state of things, Ookha immediately shut all the\ndoors, and came in great fright into the house, and, putting her arms most\naffectionately round her husband\'s neck, laid down upon the bed; then having\nconcealed him, and hid him from the sight of her female friends and\ncompanions, she began to attend upon him in secret; after some time her\nfriends and companions found out that Unroodru had come there, and that she\npassed the day and night in amorous enjoyment with her lord. One day Ookha\'s\nmother came to look after her daughter; and without being observed saw her\nseated very happily, and playing at _choupur_ in a house with a very handsome\nyoung man. On perceiving this, she returned home, without saying a word, on\ntiptoe, and in profound silence; highly delighted and uttering benedictions.\nSome days afterwards Ookha seeing her husband asleep, came forth blushing from\nthe house, and thinking to herself, "I hope that no one from not seeing me\nwill imagine, that I remain in the hose for my husband\'s sake."\n\nO great king! Ookha cleaving her husband alone, went off; but could not stay\naway from him, she returned again to the house, and shutting the doors,\nengaged in amorous diversion. On observing this act, the door-keepers said to\neach other, "Brother! what is the reason of the Raja\'s daughter having to-day\ncome out of the house after remaining there so long, and returning again\nimmediately?" One of them remarked, "Brother! for some days past I have\nobserved the doors of Ookha\'s house shut day and night, and there is some man\ninside, who sometimes laughs and talks with her, and sometimes plays at\nchoupur." Another said, "If this be true, let us go and mention the matter to\nBanasoor; why\n\np. 308\n\nshould we, knowing these circumstances, remain sitting quietly here?" One of\nthem said, "Let us not mention the matter, remain all of you at some distance\nfrom the house, let what will happen; no one can control the future, speak not\na word about what the young lady may do, but remain silent spectators of all\nthat happens."\n\nO great king! whilst the door-keepers were thus conversing with each other,\nBanasoor came wandering about there, accompanied by several strong, powerful\nmen; and as he looked up at the top of the house, not perceiving the flag,\nwhich Shivu Jee had given, said, "What has happened to remove the flag hence?"\nThe door-keepers replied, "O great king! it is now many days since the flag\nfell, and was broken to pieces." On hearing this, and calling to mind what\nShivu Jee had said, Banasoor became thoughtful, and exclaimed, "When did the\nflag fall, some enemy has come, and carried it off." When Banasoor had thus\nspoken, a door-keeper came into his presence: and joining his hands, and\nbending his head, said, "I have an important matter to communicate, which I\ncannot mention unless I obtain your permission to do so." Banasoor granting\npermission, told him to communicate what he had to say. The door-keeper then\nsaid, "O great king! excuse my fault, we have observed for some days past,\nthat a man has come into your daughter\'s house; day and night he converses\nwith her, we have not discovered what man he is, and whence he has come, and\nwhat he does."\n\nOn hearing this authentic statement, Banasoor was exceedingly angry, and\nseizing his arms, went silently and alone to Ookha\'s house; concealing\nhimself, he saw on his arrival a man of a black colour, very handsome and\ndressed in yellow, lying fast asleep with Ookha. Banasoor thought to himself,\n"It would be a sin to kill a sleeping man."\n\nO great king! with these thoughts in his mind, Banasoor stationed several\nguards there, and having told them to inform\n\np. 309\n\nhim when the man awoke; came home, and holding a court, and having summoned\nall his demons, began to say, "My enemy has arrived, take the whole of your\narmy and go and surround Ookha\'s house, I will come also by and bye."\n\nOn receiving Banasoor\'s order, the demons all came and surrounded Ookha\'s\nhouse; whilst in the mean while, Unroodru and the Raja\'s daughter having\nawoke, began to play again at choupur. Whilst they were engaged at the game,\nOokha saw thundering clouds collected from all quarters, lightning began to\nflash, frogs, peacocks and sparrow hawks began to utter cries.\n\nO great king! on hearing the sparrow hawk\'s cry, the Raja\'s daughter said,\nleaning on the neck of her beloved, "O sparrow hawk! do not call out thus,\nleave off this language of separation." In the mean while, some one came and\nsaid to Banasoor, "O great king! thy enemy has awoke." On hearing mention made\nof his enemy, Banasoor rose in great wrath; and taking arms with him, went and\nstood at Ookha\'s door, and began to peep inside. After looking some time,\nBanasoor called out loudly, "Ho! who are you inside the house, rich in\nappearance, fascinating as Cupid, with lotus-like eyes, and dressed in yellow?\nWhat thief will come forth? How will he possibly escape from me?"\n\nO great king! when Banasoor had thus bawled out, Ookha and Unroodru, on seeing\nand hearing him were greatly disquieted. The Raja\'s daughter being perplexed\nand terrified, heaving deep sighs, said to her husband, "O great king! my\nfather has come to attack us with an army of demons, how will you escape from\nhis hands?" Then Unroodru was angry, and said, "Wife! be not at all alarmed, I\nwill destroy the whole crowd of evil spirits and demons in a second."\n\nHaving thus spoken, Unroodru Jee read incantations from the Vedas, and sent\nfor a stone a hundred and eight hands long, and taking it in his hand, coming\nforth and joining the army, challenged Banasoor. On his coming out to give the\n\np. 310\n\nchallenge, Banasoor bent his bow and rushed upon Unroodru Jee with his whole\nforces, just as a swarm of honey bees would rush upon any one. When the demons\nbegan to discharge all sorts of weapons, Unroodru Jee was enraged, and began\nto deal about several such forcible blows with the stone, that the whole army\nof demons became broken and dispersed like the scum upon stagnant pools: some\nwere killed, others wounded, and all who escaped whole, fled from the field.\nBanasoor afterwards rallied them, and renewed the fight.\n\nO great king! all the weapons the demons discharged, fell in every direction,\nbut not one touched Unroodru; the weapons, which would have fallen upon\nUnroodru, the edge of the stone cut them off half way. The strokes of the\nstone could not be endured, inflicting wounds like those inflicted by Indru,\nthe lord of the gods, with a thunderbolt; heads were split in two by a blow of\nit, thighs were broken and arms and bodies cut through. When the battle had\nlasted some time, and Banasoor was left alone, the rest of the army having\nbeen cut in pieces, he was astonished, and laid hold of and fastened Unroodru\nwith a running noose, saying to himself, "Now shall I conquer this invincible\nman?"\n\nHaving proceeded thus far in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the\nRaja Pureechit,--O great king! when Banasoor fastened Unroodru in a running\nnoose, and took him to his court, Unroodru thought to himself, "Whatever\ntroubles may befal me, it is not right to falsify what Bruhmu has said; for if\nI were to escape by force from the running noose, he would be dishonoured; I\nought, therefore, to remain bound." And Banasoor kept constantly saying,\n"Youth! I will put thee to death presently; if thou hast any one to assist\nthee, send for him." Mean while, Ookha having heard of her husband\'s\ncondition, said to Chitrekha, "Friend! a curse will fall upon me, if I eat,\ndrink and sleep at my ease, whilst my husband remains in affliction."\nChitrekha replied, "Friend! be not at all anxious, no one will be able to do\nany harm to your\n\np. 311\n\nhusband; banish all care, for Shree Krishnu Chund and Bulram Jee will soon\ncome to the attack, accompanied by all the descendants of Judoo; and, having\nexterminated the army of demons, will release and take away with them you and\nUnroodru; it is their custom to carry off by force and stratagem, in any way\nthey can, all the pretty daughters of Rajas they hear of; this is the grandson\nof him, who carried off Rookmunee, the daughter of Raja Bheekmuk, after having\nfought with the very powerful and renowned Rajas Sissoopal and Joorasindhoo,\nin like manner, they will take you off also; be not, therefore, at all\napprehensive." Ookha said, "I cannot endure this affliction. They have bound\nmy husband in a running noose and carried him off; a poisonous flame, in\nconsequence thereof, burns up my body. How shall I be able to enjoy peaceful\nrepose, and how can my eyes behold the grief of my beloved? Why should I live,\nsince he, who is dearest to me, has been plunged in calamity. I will neither\neat nor drink--now Banasoor destroy my husband! O grant me, Banasoor, an\nasylum for my husband; (that is, spare his life,) whatever is to be, will\nhappen, what can any one say to prevent it? I will not respect the world nor\nthe Vedas, but will consider my husband\'s grief and happiness as my own."\n\nO great king! when Ookha had thus spoken to Chitrekha, she went to her\nhusband, and sat down near him, without fear or alarm. Some one then went and\nsaid to Banasoor, "O great king! your daughter has left the house, and gone to\nthat man." When Banasoor heard this, he sent for his son, Uskundh, saying to\nhim, "Son! bring away your sister from the court, and take her into the house,\nand confine her there, and do not allow her to go out." On receiving his\nfather\'s order, Uskundh went to his sister, and spoke very angrily to her,\n"What is this you have done, you wicked creature, throwing aside all respect\nfor the world, and consideration for your own modesty, you low thing? Why\nshould I\n\np. 312\n\nkill you (or what death shall I make you die?) It will be a crime, and I fear\nfor my own disgrace." Ookha replied, "Brother! say and do what you please, I\nhave obtained the husband whom Parbutee Jee gave me, whom else shall I run\nafter, leaving him, and thereby bring disgraceful abuse upon myself? Women of\nlow degree abandon their husbands: this is the common custom of the world, and\nalways has been so. If a woman is disgraced by living with him to whom the\ndeity has united her, she must submit."\n\nO great king! on hearing these words, Uskundh was enraged, and seizing her by\nthe hand, carried off Ookha thence to the house, and did not allow her to\nleave it; he afterwards took Unroodru Jee also thence to some other place and\nconfined him. At that time Unroodru was in great affliction at being separated\nfrom his wife, and the Raja\'s daughter denied herself all food and drink in\nthe absence of her husband, and began to perform a very severe penance. Some\ndays after this, one day Narud Jee, the sage, went first to Unroodru and\nexplained to him "Not to be at all anxious, as Shree Krishnu Chund, the root\nof joy, and Bulram, the abode of happiness, would soon release and take him\naway thence, after having fought with the evil spirits." He afterwards went to\nBanasoor and said, "Raja! he, whom you have fastened in the running noose, is\nthe grandson of Shree Krishnu, and the son of Purdiyomun, and his name is\nUnroodru. You know the descendants of Judoo well, act according to this\nknowledge, I have come to put you upon your guard in this matter and have done\nso." On hearing this, Banasoor allowed Narud Jee to take leave, saying to him,\n"Narud Jee! I know all about it."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LXIV](psa65.htm)\n\n'
