Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! The cave lower down than Sutala is\nTalatala! The Lord of Tripura, (the three cities) the great Maya Danava is the\nRuler of this region. Mahes\xc2\x92vara, the Doer of good to the three Bhuvanas,\nburnt his three cities; but at last, being pleased with his devotion, He\nrescued him. Thus Maya, by the favour of that God, has regained his own\nkingdom and the enjoyments thereof. This Maya Danava is the Teacher (\xc3\x82charya)\nof the Mayavi sect and the cult thereof; and he is skilled in various Mayas or\nall sorts of the magic powers. All the fierce demons, of cruel temper, worship\nhim for their prosperities in their various enterprises. Next to this Talatala\nis the most renowned Mahatala. The sons of Kadru, the very angry Snakes, live\nhere. They are many headed. O Vipra! I now mention to you the names of the\nfamous amongst them :-- Kuhaka, Tak _s_ aka, Su _s_ e _n_ a, and Kaliya. These\nall have very wide hoods and they all are very strong; they all are of cruel\ntemper. Their kinsmen also are so. They are always afraid of Garu _d_ a, the\nKing of birds. Surrounded with their sons, wives, friends and acquaintances,\nthey live happily, well skilled in various sports and pleasures. Lower down\nthis Mahatala is Rasatala. The Daityas, Danavas and Pa _n_ i Asuras live here.\nBesides these, there live the Nivata Kavachas of the Hira _n_ yapura city and\nthe Asuras named Kaleyas, the enemies of the Devas. These all are naturally\nvery energetic and brave; their powers are baffled by the Tejas of the\nBhagavan and they live like snakes in this region. The other Asuras that were\ndriven and were afraid of the Mantras, uttered by Sarama, the messenger of\nIndra, live here too. O Narada! Lower down is Patala, where live Vasuki, the\nChief of the snakes, and others named S\xc2\x92ankha, Kulika, S\xc2\x92veta, Dhananjaya,\nMahas\xc2\x92ankha, Dhritara _st_ ra, S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a, Kamvala, As\xc2\x92vatara, and\nDevopadattaka, all very angry, of wide hoods, and virulently poisonous. Some\nof these have five heads, some seven hoods, some ten; some hundred, some\nothers have thousand heads, while some others have on their crests exceedingly\nluminous jewels. By their rays, they dispel the darkness of the nether\nregions; but they are awfully prone to anger. At the bottom of this Patala,\nand at a distance of the\n\n\n\np. 785\n\n\n\nthirty Yoyanas; the Portion of Bhagavan in the shape of the infinite Darkness\nis reigning there. O Devar _s_ i! All the Devas worship this Form. The\ndevotees call Him by the name of Sa _n_ akar _s_ a _n_ a, as He is the\nmanifested emblem of \xc2\x93Aham\xc2\x94 and the common ground where the Seer and the Seen\nblend into one. He is the thousand-headed Controller of all, moving and non-\nmoving; He is of infinite forms; He is S\xc2\x92e _s_ a; this whole universe is being\nheld as a mustard bean on His head; He is of the Nature Intelligence and Bliss\nand He is Self-manifest. When he wants to destroy all this during the Pralaya,\nthe very powerful Sankar _s_ a _n_ a Rudra, well arrayed with the eleven\nVyuhas, military (squadrons) arrangements, springs up from Him. From His\nCentral Eyebrow, looking wide with His Three Eyes and raising His Trident,\nresplendent with three flames. All the (prominent) principal snakes, ruling\nover many others, come to Him during the nights filled with devotion and\nsurrounded with Bhaktas (devotees) and bow down to Him with their heads bent\nlow and look at each other\xc2\x92s faces, enlightened with the lights from the\njewels shining with clear lustre, on the nails of the red toes of His Lotus-\nFeet. At that time their faces become brilliant with the rays emitting from\nthe jewels on the top of their very gay encircled hoods; and their cheeks look\nbeautiful and shining. The daughters of the Naga Raja also do like this; when\nvery beautiful rays come out of their perfectly excellent bodies. Their arms\nare wide extended; they look very clear and they are beautifully white. They\nuse always Sandalpaste, Aguru and Ka _s_ miri unguents. Being overpowered by\nthe amorous passion, due to their contact with those scented things, they look\nat Him with bashful glances and sweet smiles and expect \xc3\x82siss (benedictions)\nfrom Him. And then His eyes roll maddened with love and express signs of\nkindness and mercy. The Bhagavan Ananta Deva is of boundless strength; His\nattributes are infinite; He is the ocean of infinite qualities. He is the \xc3\x82di\nDeva, of a very good nature and His Nature is highly luminous. He has\nabandoned anger and envy and He wants the welfare of all. All the Devas\nworship Him and He is the repository of all Sattvic qualities.\n\n\n\nThe Devas, Siddhas, Asuras, Uragas, Vidyadharas, Gandharbas, and Munis always\nmeditate on Him. On account of His constant Mada Raga the enthusiasm and\nintoxication, His sight appears intoxicated and His eyes look perturbed with\nemotions. He is always pleasing to those who surround him and to the Devas by\nHis sweet nectar-like words.\n\n\n\nThe Vaijayanti garland hangs from His neck; it never wanes and it is always\ndecorated with the fresh and clear Tulasi leaves. The\n\n\n\np. 786\n\n\n\nmaddened bees make their humming noises incessantly and thus add to the\nbeauty. He is the Deva of the Devas and He wears a blue coloured cloth and He\nis ornamented with only one earring. He (the God Vi _sn_ u) Undecaying and\nImmutable; resting His fleshy arms on the Halakakuda (the lofty portion of the\nplough), He is upholding the golden girdle as the elephant Airavata of Indra\nupholds the golden girdle. O Narada! The devotees describe Him as the Source\nof this Leela of the Universe and the Controller of the Devas.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twentieth Chapter of the Eighth Book on the narrative of the\nTalatala in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, of 18,000 verses, by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 21](bk08ch21.htm)\n\n'
