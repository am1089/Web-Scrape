The word "Jnana," being derived\nfrom the Sanskrit root Jna," to know, means knowledge; and the ideal which it\nholds up before its followers is the realization of that Absolute Truth, which\nis the one common source of all subjective and objective phenomena in the\nuniverse. It teaches that there is one life, one Being, one Reality, and that\nall notions of distinction and differentiation, that all beliefs in the\npermanent duality or multiplicity of existence are unreal and illusory.\n\nJnana Yoga is based entirely upon the monistic principles of the _Advaita_ or\nnon-dualistic system of Vedanta. Its purpose is to show that subject and\nobject are but\n\np. 107\n\nthe two expressions of one Absolute Being or Substance; that God and man, the\nCreator and the created, are only different aspects of one Universal Reality.\nIts aim is to resolve the divers phenomena into one ultimate Being, from which\nproceed all powers and all forces manifested in external and internal nature,\nand which is the abode of infinite intelligence and eternal happiness.\n\nAccording to Jnana Yoga, matter, mind, intellect, sense-powers, names, and\nforms are but the apparent manifestations of that one Substance which is\ncalled in Sanskrit Brahman. They may appear to us as real, but they have in\ntruth only relative reality. The phenomena of the universe are like the waves\nin the ocean of Brahman. As waves rise in the sea, and after playing for a\nwhile, once more merge into it, so the waves of subject and object rise, live,\nand dissolve\n\np. 108\n\nin the ocean of that Absolute Substance Brahman. Brahman is described in\nVedanta as "That of which all animate and inanimate objects are born, by which\nthey live, and into which they return after dissolution. It should be known\nand realized by all." It is the essence of Divinity. It is like the eternal\ncanvas upon which the Creator or the Cosmic Ego and the created or individual\negos are painted by Maya, the inscrutable creative power of the Infinite\nBeing.\n\nThe chief object of Jnana Yoga is to unify God and the individual Soul and to\nshow the absolute oneness that exists between them on the highest spiritual\nplane. The individual ego; being the reflection or image of Divinity or\nBrahman, in its true nature is divine, and this true Self is known in Sanskrit\nas the _\xc3\x82 tman_. The knowledge of this oneness of the \xc3\x82tman or subjective\n\np. 109\n\nreality with Brahman, the Universal Truth, is described in Jnana Yoga as the\nonly means of attaining to complete liberation from the bondage of selfishness\nand from attachment to body and senses, which are the causes of all\nworldliness, unhappiness, and misery. The light of the knowledge of the \xc3\x82tman\nand of its unity with Brahman alone will dispel the darkness of ignorance\nwhich prevents us from reaching the abode of Absolute Existence, Intelligence,\nand Bliss, and which now deludes us into identifying the individual Self with\nthe body, senses, mind, and their modifications. This ignorance is designated\nin Sanskrit _Avidy a_ or ne-science, and is the source of all false knowledge,\negotism, attachment to the lower self and to the world. Being deceived by the\nillusive power of _Avidy a_, we mistake body for soul and soul for body,\nmatter for spirit and\n\np. 110\n\nspirit for matter. In ignorance of our true Self, we work solely to gratify\nselfish motives and to reap some result from our actions. But Jnana Yoga would\nwaken us from this sleep of ignorance, by showing us that the \xc3\x82tman is\nimmortal, unchangeable, all-knowing, and free by its own nature from eternity\nto eternity; that through the influence of _Avidy a_, the individual ego\nthinks of itself as changeable and subject to birth and death, and forgetting\nthat the fountain-head of freedom, knowledge, and everlasting happiness is\nabiding within, it seeks knowledge and happiness from outside and becomes the\nslave of desires and passions. It further reminds us that whatever we think or\nperform mentally or physically is like a dream in the sleep of self-delusion\ncaused by the power of _Avidy a_; that these dreams of the sleep of ignorance\ncan be removed neither by work, nor by\n\np. 111\n\ndevotion, nor by meditation, but by the light and power of _Vidy a_, the\nknowledge of the \xc3\x82tman or Self and of its relation to Brahman.\n\nThis knowledge cannot be obtained as the result of any virtuous act or prayer,\nbut comes to the soul when the intellect and heart have been purified by\nunselfish and righteous works, and when the individual ego begins to\ndiscriminate between the real and unchangeable \xc3\x82tman and apparent and\nchangeable matter or force. Jnana Yoga teaches that right discrimination and\nproper analysis are indispensable to the acquisition of knowledge of the true\nSelf and of the Reality which underlies phenomenal objects. It also declares\nthat knowledge of the Self will bring to the soul the realization of Absolute\nTruth more quickly than the practice of Raja, Karma, or Bhakti Yoga.\n\np. 112\n\nThe path of wisdom, therefore, is best fitted for those earnest and sincere\nseekers after Truth who have no leaning towards active life, who are not\ndevotional in their nature, but who are preeminently intellectual, and who,\nhaving realized the transitory and ephemeral character of phenomenal objects,\nare no longer contented with sense-pleasures. It is for those who wish to be\nfree from all fetters and attachments, and who care nothing for earthly\nprosperity, success, social honor, fame, or the fulfilment of personal\nambitions; but whose sole desire is to know who they are in reality, what is\ntheir true nature, and what relation exists between their soul, God, and the\nuniverse.\n\nA traveller along this path should be philosophical in tendency, should have a\nsharp intellect and a keen power of analyzing the true nature of things. He\nshould\n\np. 113\n\nalso have a firm conviction that the ultimate Truth or Reality of the universe\nis unchangeable. Using the sword of right discrimination between the Self and\nthe non-self, he should sever all ties, and should never allow himself to be\noverpowered by any external or internal influence. His mind should be\nundisturbed by passions or desires, his senses well controlled, and his body\nstrong, healthy, and capable of bearing all hardships as well as of overcoming\nall environmental conditions. He should have dispassion; and be ever ready to\nrenounce anything that does not help him in his realization of Truth. He must\nhave absolute confidence in the teachings of Jnana Yogins, or those who have\nbecome Seers of Truth by following the path of wisdom; and he must likewise\nhave faith in the final Truths expounded by the monistic system of Vedanta.\n\np. 114\n\nThe mind of a beginner in Jnana Yoga must possess the power of perfect\nconcentration and meditation; and his soul must be filled with the longing for\nabsolute freedom from all relative conditions and from the laws which govern\nphenomena. He must realize that even the enjoyment of heavenly pleasures is a\nkind of bondage, since it keeps the soul entangled in the meshes of phenomenal\nrelativity. Being well-armed with all these noble qualities as his weapons, a\nJnana Yogi should fight against phenomenal appearances, and with the ideal of\nthe unity of the true Self and the Absolute Brahman ever before his mind\'s\neye, he should march onward toward its realization, breaking down all names\nand forms with the hammer of right analysis, and cleaving all ties of\nattachment with the sword of proper discrimination. Nor should he stop until\nthe goal is\n\np. 115\n\nreached. He who goes through the path of wisdom, burns the vast forest of the\ntrees of phenomenal names and forms by starting in it the fire of right\nknowledge. All these names and forms are produced by Maya, the inscrutable\npower of Brahman; and according to Jnana Yoga this power of Maya is\ninseparable from Brahman as the power of heating is inseparable from fire. A\nJnana Yogi, in his search after Brahman, should reject all names and forms by\nsaying "Not this," "Not this," until he realizes the one nameless, formless,\nand absolute Being of the universe, where the subject and the object, the\nknower, knowledge, and its object, losing their relativity, merge into the\ninfinite Ocean of Blissful Existence and Supreme Intelligence.\n\nA sincere seeker after Truth should hear over and over again that the \xc3\x82tman or\n\np. 116\n\ntrue Self is one with Brahman or the Eternal Truth; and should repeat such\nphrases as "I am Brahman," "I am one with the Absolute Source of knowledge,\nexistence, and bliss." He should constantly think of the meaning of " _Tat\nTwain asi_ "--"That thou art," and should devote his time to meditating upon\nthis oneness until the light of Brahman illumines his soul, dispelling the\ndarkness of _Avidy a_ and transforming his ego into the essence of Divinity.\n\nInstead of worshipping a personal God like a Bhakta, a Jnana Yogi should\nclearly understand the true significance of all His attributes as given in the\ndifferent Scriptures--such as Creator or Governor of the universe, He is\nSpirit, infinite, omniscient, all-powerful, unchangeable, true, and one; and\nrejecting the worship of the personal God as an act proceeding from _Avidy a_\nor\n\np. 117\n\nignorance of the divine nature of the Self or \xc3\x82tman, he should seek that which\nis above all attributes and beyond all descriptions, which transcends the\nrealm of thought and cannot be revealed by human intellect or understanding.\nHe should realize that all conceptions of a personal God are more or less\nanthropomorphic, and that the Creator himself must be phenomenal since He can\nexist only in relation to the created object. A Jnana Yogi, consequently, does\nnot pray to the personal God or to any other Spirit or Being. To him prayers\nand devotions are useless and unnecessary. He does not seek any supernatural\nhelp or Divine mercy, for he is conscious of the omnipotent and omniscient\nnature of the \xc3\x82tman, and knows that his true Self is beyond good and evil,\nabove virtue and vice, unlimited by all laws, and that it reigns over nature\nin its own glory.\n\np. 118\n\n[paragraph continues] He feels that it is the same in essence as the Creator\nor personal God. Instead of identifying himself with body, mind, senses, or\nintellect, he always remembers that he is the \xc3\x82tman, which is birthless,\ndeathless, sinless, fearless, immutable, eternally peaceful, and ever\nundisturbed by pleasant or unpleasant experiences, sensations, or mental and\nphysical changes.\n\nA true Jnana Yogi constantly tries to keep himself above all phenomenal\nconditions, and incessantly repeats "I am Brahman," "Soham"--I am He, I am He.\nHe says within himself:\n\n"I am neither mind, nor intellect, nor ego, nor senses; I am neither earth,\nnor water, nor air, nor fire, nor ether, but my true nature is absolute\nexistence, knowledge, and bliss. I am He, I am He."\n\n"I am neither the organic activity nor am I the elements of the body, neither\nthe\n\np. 119\n\nsense of knowledge nor that of action, but I am absolute existence, knowledge,\nand bliss. I am He, I am He."\n\n"I have neither hatred nor love, neither greed nor delusion, neither egotism\nnor pride nor vanity, neither creed nor faith, nor aim nor desire for freedom.\nI am absolute existence, knowledge, and bliss. I am He, I am He."\n\n"I have neither virtue nor vice nor sin. neither pleasure nor pain, neither\nScriptures nor rituals nor ceremonies. I am neither food nor am I the eater. I\nam absolute existence, knowledge, and bliss. I am He, I am He."\n\n"I have neither death nor fear of death, nor birth nor caste distinction;\nneither father nor mother, neither friend nor foe, neither master nor\ndisciple. I am absolute existence, knowledge, and bliss. I am He, I am He."\n\np. 120\n\n"I have neither doubt nor question. I am formless and all-pervading. I am the\neternal Lord of nature and the master of the senses. I am neither bound nor\nfree. I am one with Brahman. I am the omnipresent Divinity, I am the immutable\nLord of all. I am absolute existence, knowledge, and bliss. I am He, I am He."\n\nThus constantly practicing discrimination and rising above all relativity and\nphenomenal appearances, a Jnana Yogi realizes the Absolute, Unchangeable,\nEternal Truth in this life and ultimately becomes one with it; because Jnana\nYoga declares that he who knows Brahman becomes Brahman, for the same reason\nthat the knower of God can be no other than God himself. A Jnana Yogi never\nforgets that his true Self is Brahman. Having attained to this supreme God-\nconsciousness, he lives in the world like an eternal witness of\n\np. 121\n\nall mental and physical changes. Ever happy and undisturbed, he travels from\nplace to place, pointing out to mankind the way to absolute freedom and\nperfection. A perfect Jnana Yogi, indeed, lives as the embodiment of the\nAbsolute Divinity on this earth.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Science of Breathing](hby10.htm)\n\n'
