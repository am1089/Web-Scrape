Forward (goes) your [1](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:1:1) strength tending\nheavenward, rich in offerings, with the (ladle) full of ghee. To the gods goes\n(the worshipper) desirous of their favour.\n\n2\\. I magnify [1](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:2:1) with prayer Agni who has knowledge\nof prayers (?), the accomplisher of sacrifice, who hears us, and in whom\n(manifold wealth) has been laid down.\n\n3\\. O Agni, may we be able to bridle thee the strong god\n[1](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:3:1); may we overcome (all) hostile powers.\n\n\n\n4\\. Agni, inflamed at the sacrifice, the purifier who should be magnified,\nwhose hair is flame--him we approach (with prayers).\n\n5\\. With his broad stream of light the immortal Agni, clothed in ghee, well\nserved with oblations, is the carrier of offerings at the sacrifice.\n\n6\\. Holding the (sacrificial) ladles, performing the sacrifice they have with\nright thought pressingly brought Agni hither [1](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:6:1) for\nhelp.\n\n\n\n7\\. The Hot _ri_ , the immortal god goes in front with his secret power\n[1](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:7:1), instigating the sacrifices\n[2](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:7:2).\n\n8\\. The strong (horse, i. e. Agni) is set at the races. He is led forth at the\nsacrifices, the priest, the accomplisher of sacrifice.\n\n9\\. He has been produced [1](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:9:1) by prayer, the\nexcellent one. I have established [2](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:9:2) him, the germ\nof beings, for ever the father of Daksha [3](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:9:3).\n\n\n\np. 297\n\n10\\. I have laid thee down [1](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:10:1), the excellent one,\nwith the nourishment [2](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:10:2) of Daksha, O thou who art\nproduced by power, O Agni, thee the resplendent one, O U _s_ i _g_\n[3](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:10:3).\n\n11\\. The priests, eager to set to work the _Ri_ ta\n[1](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:11:1), kindle with quick strength Agni the governor\n[2](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:11:2), him who crosses the waters\n[3](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:11:3).\n\n12\\. I magnify [1](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:12:1) the child of vigour at this\nsacrifice, who shines under the heaven, the thoughtful Agni.\n\n\n\n13\\. He who should be magnified and adored, who is visible through the\ndarkness, Agni, the manly, is kindled [1](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:13:1).\n\n14\\. Agni, the manly, is kindled, he who draws hither the gods like a horse.\nThe (worshippers) rich in offerings magnify him.\n\n15\\. We the manly ones will kindle thee the manly (god), O manly Agni who\nshinest mightily.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi. The metre is Gayatri.--The position of the hymn in the\ncollection shows that it is to be divided into T _ri_ _k_ as, and this is\nconfirmed by the ritual use of several of these T _ri_ _k_ as (see Bergaigne,\nRecherches sur l'Histoire de la Liturgie Vedique, 19, note 1). Some of the T\n_ri_ _k_ as at least, however, do not seem to form independent hymns; verse 10\nvery probably stands in connection with verse 9, and the same seems to be the\ncase with verses 12 and 13. Ludwig (IV, 305) and Bergaigne (loc. cit.)\nconsider the whole Sukta as a collection of Samidhenis or verses to be recited\nfor each piece of wood thrown into the fire. Comp. Hillebrandt, Neu- und\nVollmondsopfer, 77.--Verse 1\n\np. 298\n\n[paragraph continues] = TS. II, 5, 7, 2; TB. III, 5, 2, 1; MS. I, 6, 1; IV,\n14, 3. Verses 2, 3 = TB. II, 4, 2, 4. 5; MS. IV, 11, 2. Verse 4 = TS. II, 5,\n8, 6; TB. III, 5, 2, 3. Verses 5-6 = TB. III, 6, 1, 3; MS. IV, 10, 1 (verse 5\n= MS. IV, 11, 2). Verses 7-9 = SV. II, 827-829\\. Verses 13-15 = SV. II,\n888-890; TB. III, 5, 2, 2; AV. XX, 102, 1-3.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Of the priests and sacrificers?\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. The text has i\xc2\xb4 _l_ e.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Comp. above, II, 5, 1.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Comp. IV, 17, 18. vayam hi a\xc2\xb4 te _k_ ak _ri_ ma saba\xc2\xb4dha _h_.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. Mayaya: comp. H. O., Religion des Veda, 163, 294.\n\nNote 2. Vidathani: comp. I, 31, 6, note 2.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. This seems to mean, 'he has been set to work.'\n\nNote 2. \xc3\x82\xc2\xb4 dadhe must be first person (comp. ni dadhe, verse 10) for the\nbhuta\xc2\xb4nam garbha _h_ is Agni.\n\nNote 3. Or, the father of intelligence. Daksha is the personified\nintelligence. Comp. vol. xxxii, p. 245 seq.; Bergaigne, Religion Vedique, III,\n93 seq.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. See above, III, 23, 4.\n\nNote 2. The text has i _l_ a\xc2\xb4, the same word as in 24, 2.--Prof. Max Muller\nobserves, 'Could it be, ni tva dadhe i _l_ a, I have placed thee on the altar\nwith nutriment, son of the strength of Daksha?'\n\nNote 3. Or, 'the willing one.'\n\np. 299\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. 'Setting to work the Right ( _Ri_ ta)' means here 'performing the\nsacrifice.' The sacrifice is considered as a sphere especially pervaded by the\npower of _Ri_ ta. Comp. H. O., Religion des Veda, 197.\n\nNote 2. Yanturam (comp. VIII, 19, 2. agnim i _li_ shva yanturam; Lanman, 486)\nmust be the same as yanta\xc2\xb4ram (comp. \xce\xbc\xce\xac\xcf\x81\xcf\x84\xcf\x85\xcf\x81? [M. M.] See de Saussure, Memoire\nsur le Systeme Primitif des Voyelles, p. 207; but comp. also Kretschmer,\nKuhn's Zeitschrift, XXXI, p. 447). To me it seems to be an accommodation to\napturam, facilitated probably by the influence of the genitive yantur. See\nLanman, Noun-Inflection in the Veda, p. 486; Wackernagel in Kuhn's\nZeitschrift, XXV, 287.\n\nNote 3. See Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 122 seq.; H. O., Gottingische\nGelehrte Anzeigen, 1889, p. 4 seq.\n\n##### Verse 12.\n\nNote 1. The text has i _l_ e. In the same way i _l_ enya _h_ verse 13, i _l_\nate verse 14.\n\n##### Verse 13.\n\nNote 1. Observe sam idhyate here and verse 14, sam idhimahi verse 15. The\nverses 13-15 form one T _ri_ _k_ a.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 28](sbe46088.htm)\n\n"
