Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! When the Bhagavan went away to Vaiku\n_nt_ ha, establishing the Earth in due position and equilibrium, Brahma spoke\nthus to his son :-- \xc2\x93O Powerful Son of mine, O Svayamhhuva! The best of those\nthat are filled with Teja (energy) and Tapas! Now go on with your work of\ncreation, as you think proper, on this earth, the Upholdress of all the Jivas.\nAnd worship the Puru _s_ a, the Lord of Sacrifices, according to the division\nof place and time, and with all the necessary materials of various kinds, high\nand low, and those that will be useful in performing your sacrifices. Do\nDharma according to the S'astras, and according to the Var _n_ a(the different\ncastes) and \xc3\x82srama (Brahmacharya, etc.); thus by gradually going on step by\nstep in the path of Yoga, your progeny will be multiplied. Beget lovely sons\nand daughters, of good fame, culture, modesty and ornamented with various\nother good qualifications, like yourself; then marry your daughters when they\nwill come to the marriageable age, to proper persons of good qualifications\nand then fix your mind thoroughly on the Excellent Puru _s_ a that is the very\nBest. O Child! Now go and serve the Bhagavan with devotion as I have advised\nyou; and you will certainly attain that which is difficult to be worshipped\nand obtained. Advising thus his son Svayambhuva Manu, and starting him in his\nwork; of creation, the Lotus-born, the Lord of all the subjects, Brahma went\naway to His own abode. When Brahma went away, having ordered his son to create\nprogeny and subjects, Manu, took that seriously in his heart and began to do\nthat work. In due time, he had two powerful sons named Priyavrata and\nUttanapada and three lovely beautiful daughters endowed with various good\nqualities. Hear the names of the three daughters. The first daughter, the\npurifier of the world, was named \xc3\x82kuti; the second was named Devahuti and the\nthird was Prasuti. The first daughter \xc3\x82kuti was married to the Mahar _s_ i\nRuchi; the second was married to the Prajapati Karddama; and the third was\nmarried to the Prajapati Dak _s_ a. And know that all the beings in this world\nhad their origin from this last daughter. Now hear the progeny of these three\ndaughters and the Mahar _s_ is respectively :-- By Mahar _s_ i Ruchi was born\none son named Yaj\xc3\xb1a, in the womb of \xc3\x82kuti; he is the part of\n\n\n\np. 748\n\n\n\nthe Bhagavan \xc3\x82di Purusa Vi _sn_ u; by Mahar _s_ i Karddama, in the womb of\nDevahuti was born the Bhagavan Kapila Deva, the famous author of the S'ankhya\nS'astra; and in the womb of Prasuti, by the Prajapati Dak _s_ a were born some\ndaughters only; know that the Devas, men, beasts and birds were all created by\nthis Prajapati Dak _s_ a. These offsprings were the first promulgators in the\nwork of creation. In the Svayambhuva Manvantara, the powerful Bhagavan Yaj\xc3\xb1a,\nby the help of the Deva named Yama, saved his mother's Father Manu from the\nattacks of the Rak _s_ asas; and the great Lord of the Yogis, the Bhagavan\nKapila, remained for a while in his \xc3\x82srama and gave spiritual instructions to\nhis mother Devahuti, by which Avidya could be at once destroyed, and disclosed\nhis S'ankhya S'astra, the great work on the Spiritual Philosophy and the\nspecial Dhyana Yoga in all its details and finally went for Samadhi to the\n\xc3\x82srama of Pulaha where the great Deva Samkhya charya lives up to today. Oh! I\nbow down to the great Yogacharya, the Bhagavan Kapila Deva, the Fructifier of\nall desires, the more remembrance of Whose Name makes easily the Yogi realise\nthe meaning of the Samkhya J\xc3\xb1ana. The sins are immediately destroyed of those\nthat hear or read the holy anecdote of the progeny of the daughters of Manu. O\nChild! Now I describe to you the progeny of the sons of Svayambhuva Manu. Hear\nattentively. The hearing of which will enable one to enter into the highest\nplace. Now is being described the history about the progeny of those who\nformed those Dvipas (islands) Var _s_ as(countries) and oceans for the welfare\nand happiness of all the creation and for the use of them. Hear.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Third Chapter of the Eighth Book on the description of the\nfamily of Manu in S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, the Maha Pura _n_ am, of 18,000\nverses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 4](bk08ch04.htm)\n\n"
