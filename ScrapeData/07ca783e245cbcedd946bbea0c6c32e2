Narayanasvami Aiyar, [1914], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 34\n\n### AM\xe1\xb9\x9a\xe1\xb9\xacABIN\xe1\xb8\x8cU 1-UPANISHA\xe1\xb8\x8c\n\n### OF\n\n### K\xe1\xb9\x9aSH\xe1\xb9\x86A-YAJURVE\xe1\xb8\x8cA\n\nOm. Manas (mind) is said to be of two kinds, the pure and the impure. That\nwhich is associated with the thought of desire is the impure, while that which\nis without desire is the pure. To men, their mind alone is the cause of\nbondage or emancipation. That mind which is attracted by objects of sense\ntends to bondage, while that which is not so attracted tends to emancipation.\nNow inasmuch as to a mind without a desire for sensual objects there is stated\nto be salvation, therefore an aspirant after emancipation should render his\nmind ever free from all longing after material objects. When a mind freed from\nthe desires for objects and controlled in the heart attains the reality of\n\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, then is it in the Supreme Seat. Till that which arises in the heart\nperishes, till then it (Manas) should be controlled. This only is (true)\nwisdom. This only is true \xe1\xb8\x8chy\xc4\x81na (meditation). Other ways are but long or\ntedious. It (Brahman) is not at all one that can be contemplated upon. It is\nnot one that cannot be contemplated upon. It is not capable of contemplation,\n(and yet) it should be contemplated upon. Then one attains Brahman that is\ndevoid of partiality. Yoga should be associated with Swara (sound, accent).\n(Brahman) should be meditated upon without Swara. By meditating without Swara\nupon Brahman, that which is cannot become non-existent. Such a Brahman is\npartless, devoid of fancy and quiescent (or free from the action of mind).\nWhoever cognizes "I" to be that Brahman\n\np. 35\n\nattains certainly Brahman. A wise man having known that Brahman, that is\nwithout fancy, without end, without cause, or example, beyond inference and\nwithout beginning, is emancipated. There is (for him then) no destruction, no\ncreation, no person in bondage, no devotee, no aspirant for salvation, no\nemancipated person. This is the truth. \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 that should be contemplated upon\nis One in (the three states), the waking, the dreaming, and the dreamless\nsleep. There is no rebirth to him who goes beyond the three states. The one\nBh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 of all beings is in all beings. Like the moon (reflected) in water,\nhe appears as one and as many. While a pot is being carried (from one place to\nanother), the \xc4\x80k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b (ether) that is within it is not carried (along with it).\nAs the pot alone is carried, J\xc4\xabva (within the body) may be likened to the\n\xc4\x80k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b. Like the pot, the body has various kinds of forms. The body which\nperishes again and again is not conscious of its own destruction. But he (the\nJ\xc4\xabva) knows (it) always. He who is enveloped by the M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81 of sound, is never\nable to come to (or see) the sun (of Parabrahman) from the darkness (of\nignorance). Should such darkness be cleared, then he alone sees the non-dual\nstate. Parabrahman is \xc5\x9aab\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81kshara. 1 What remains after the cessation of\n\xc5\x9aab\xe1\xb8\x8da-Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das, that is Akshara (indestructible)\', should be meditated upon by a\nlearned man who wishes to secure quiescence to his \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81.\n\nTwo Vi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81s (sciences) are fit to be known, _viz_., \xc5\x9aab\xe1\xb8\x8dabrahman and\nParabrahman. One who has completely mastered \xc5\x9aab\xe1\xb8\x8dabrahman attains Parabrahman.\nHaving studied well the books, the learned man should persevere studiously in\nJ\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na (the acquisition of knowledge) and Vij\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na (Self-realisation according\nto such knowledge). Then he should discard the whole of the books, as a person\nin quest of grain gives up the straw. Though there are cows of different\ncolours, yet their milk is of the same colour. Like milk is seen J\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, and\nlike cows are seen the different kinds of forms (in the universe). As ghee is\nlatent in milk, so is Vij\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na (Self-realisation) latent in every being.\nThrough churning always the Manas with the\n\np. 36\n\nchurning-stick of Manas and the string of J\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, Parabrahman that is partless,\ncalm and quiescent should be brought out like fire from the wood. I am that\nBrahman. That V\xc4\x81su\xe1\xb8\x8deva who is support of all beings, who lives in all and who\nprotects all creatures is Myself. That V\xc4\x81su\xe1\xb8\x8deva is Myself.\n\nSuch is the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d.\n\nOm-\xe1\xb9\xacat-Sa\xe1\xb9\xad.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[34:1](tmu08.htm#fr_10) Lit., the immortal germ.\n\n[35:1](tmu08.htm#fr_11) It is the indestructible known through the sound or\nthe Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 7. \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadmabo\xe1\xb8\x8dha-Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d of \xe1\xb9\x9agve\xe1\xb8\x8da](tmu09.htm)\n\n'
