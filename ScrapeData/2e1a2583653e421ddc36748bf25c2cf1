His\nbody reached to the sky; his hard back was like a stone, his two sharp horns\nwere standing erect: and blood-red eyes filled with rage. Raising his tail, he\nwandered about bellowing, sometimes he stopt, and then roamed about again,\nletting fall dung. He made his shoulders writhe, and ears shake. All the gods\nleft their chariots, and ran off. With his hoof he dug up the bank of the\nriver, and upset a hill with his back, and cast it on the ground. All were in\nconsternation at that time; the supporters of the world, and the guardian\ndeities of the ten quarters trembled. The earth quaked: the king of the\nserpent race, on whose head the world is supported, trembled. Cows dropped\ntheir calves, and women miscarried. On seeing the bull, the cows dispersed in\nevery direction; and the inhabitants of Bruj ran off to where Krishnu and\nBulram were coming up behind them. Making obeisance they said, "O great king!\na little distance in front, there is an immense bull, standing in the road:\nsave us from it."\n\np. 123\n\nOn hearing this, Shree Krishnu Chund, acquainted with the secrets of the\nheart, said, "Do not be afraid of it. It has come upon the earth in the form\nof a bull, because it desires its destruction from me." On saying these words,\nhe went forward, and on seeing the bull, Krishnu exclaimed, "Come to me; you,\nwho have assumed a treacherous form? Why do you frighten any one else, why not\ncome near me? The so-called lion\'s enemy runs not after deer. Behold! I am\nGobind, in the form of death, and have utterly destroyed many like you."\n\nHe again called out, striking the upper parts of his arms in preparation for\nbattle, "Come and fight with me." On hearing these words, the enraged demon\nrushed forth with such impetuous violence, that it seemed as if a thunderbolt\nof Indru\'s were hurled upon the earth. As often as Krishnu drove him back, he\nrecovered himself, and rushed on again. At one time, when Krishnu had dashed\nhim upon the earth, he rose up in great fury, and pinned Huri between his two\nhorns. Then Shree Krishnu Jee, escaping with activity, and placing his foot on\none of the legs of the bull, laid hold of his horn, and twisted it in the same\nway, that a person would wring wet clothes. At length, the bull fell down, and\nits life ebbed out.\n\nAt this time, the gods seated in their chariots, were so rejoiced, that they\nbegan to rain down flowers; and the [cowherdesses](errata.htm#3) and cowherds,\nto celebrate with songs the great renown of Krishnu. In the mean while Shree\nRadhika Jee came and said to Huri, "O great king! you have committed a crime\nin having killed any being in the form of a bull. For this reason go and bathe\nin some place of holy pilgrimage, then you may touch other persons."\n[Krishnu](errata.htm#4) replied, "I will summon all the places of pilgrimage\nto Bruj." Having thus said, he went near the hill Goberdhun, and caused two\ndeep pits to be dug. And the places of pilgrimage came there in bodily shape;\nand having mentioned their names, and thrown water into the pits, departed.\nAfter this Shree Krishnu,\n\np. 124\n\nhaving bathed in the pits, on coming out, made an offering of a great many\ncows, and having fed many Brahmins, was purified. And from that day, the two\npits became famous as the pit of Krishnu, and the pit of Radhika.\n\nHaving finished narrating this incident, Shree Shookdeo, the sage, said,--O\ngreat king! one day, Narud Jee, the sage, came to Kuns; and when he had\nexplained to him the secrets of the birth of Bulram and Krishnu, and of the\ncoming of the delusive power, and of the going off of Krishnu, Kuns was angry,\nand said, "You speak truth. At first, he brought his son and gave him to me,\nhaving by that means increased the confidence of my mind: as a thug, who shows\nyou something, and afterwards runs off with all your property."\n\nOn saying these words, having sent for Basoodeo, he had him bound down, and\nputting his hand on his sword, said with great agitation of mind, "I have\ndiscovered that you acted with great treachery towards me. I looked upon you\nas a good and virtuous man. You sent Krishnu off, and gave him to Nund; Dewee\nhas come and shown me. Your words corresponded not with your thoughts and\ndesigns; I will certainly put you to death to-day on this spot. A friend,\nrelation, attendant or person professing great regard for another, who\npractices deceit, is very sinful. Your words were sweet, but your mind filled\nwith poison. You were intent only on deceit. An evil spirit is better than one\nwho acts maliciously in affairs which concern himself."\n\nSpeaking in this vain, foolish manner, Kuns said again to Narud Jee, "O great\nking! I have not yet found out the secrets of his mind: a boy was born, and he\ncame and showed me a girl. The child, which he mentioned as having died in\nconsequence of the mother\'s miscarriage, was born at Gokool as Buldeo." Thus\nhaving said, he gnashed his teeth with rage: and as he raised his sword to\nkill Basoodeo, Narud, the sage, having laid hold of his hand, said, "Raja!\nkeep Basoodeo a prisoner for the present, and arrange so that you may lay\n\np. 125\n\nhold of Krishnu and Buldeo, (or so that Krishnu and Buldeo may come here.)"\n\nWhen Narud Jee had made this suggestion and departed Kuns shut up Basoodeo and\nDewukee in a room; and being distracted with fear, sent for a devil, named\nKesee, and said to him, "O possessed of great strength! you are one of my\nretainers. I have great confidence in you. Go at once to Bruj, and having\nkilled Bulram and Krishnu, show their bodies to me."\n\nKesee, on hearing this speech, and receiving the order, bowing his head, took\nleave, and went to Brindabun. And Kuns summoned Sal, Toosal, Chanoor, Arisht,\nByomasoor and all his other counsellors. On their arrival, he explained to\nthem and said, "My enemy has taken up his abode near me; reflect and\ndeliberate how you can draw out the thorn which is pricking my mind."\n\nThe counsellors said, "O great king! you are very powerful, whom do you fear?\nWhat great difficulty will be in destroying Bulram and Krishnu? Be not at all\nanxious. We will counsel you, how, by means of stratagem and force, they will\ncome here. First of all we will cause to be built such a beautiful and elegant\ntheatre, that on hearing of its splendour people will crowd from towns and\nvillages to see it. After this, do you cause a sacrifice to be made to\nMuhadeo, and procure goats and buffaloes for the burnt-offering. On hearing\nnews of this, all the inhabitants of Bruj will bring presents, and Bulram and\nKrishnu will come with them. Then some wrestler will throw them down, or some\nother very strong man will kill them at the gate."\n\nOn hearing these suggestions, Kuns assenting to the advice, said,\n"Counsellors! you have given good counsel." He sent for a wrestler, and having\ntreated him with great respect gave him a beera of betel.\n\nAfter this, holding a court, he began to say to his powerful devils, "When my\nnephews, Bulram and Krishnu, come here,\n\np. 126\n\none of you destroy them, that the apprehensions of my mind may be removed."\nHaving thus explained to them, he sent for a mahout and said to him, "You have\na must elephant under you, take it to the gate and remain there. When the two\nbrothers come and attempt to enter, have them torn to pieces by the elephant,\nand do not give them a chance of escape. If you will destroy them both, I will\ngive you whatever wealth you may ask for."\n\nHaving thus explained to them all, and determined upon a sacrifice to Shivu on\nthe fourteenth of the dark part of the month Kartik, Kuns sent for Akroor in\nthe evening; and having given him a most civil reception, took him inside his\nhouse; giving him a seat on a throne near him, and laying hold of his hand, he\nsaid with the greatest affection, "You are the greatest in the family of\nJudoo; intelligent, religious and resolute; and, therefore, all know and\nrespect you. There is no one, who is not pleased at seeing you. For this\nreason, as a dwarf, (the fifth incarnation of Vishnu,) accomplished, an\nimportant business for Indru, having by stratagem taken possession of the\nwhole government of Bali, the sovereign of the infernal regions, and made it\nover to Indru; so do you perform an important action for me, and go at once to\nBrindabun, and bring the two sons of Dewukee here; in whatever way the affair\nmay be managed, whether by artifice or force. It is said, that the great\nendure difficulties themselves in accomplishing the objects of others; you\nhave the same interest in all my affairs as myself. What more shall I say;\nbring them here in any way you can, and they will easily be destroyed. Either\nChanoor will throw them prostrate, or the elephant Koobliya will lay hold of\nand tear them to pieces. If not, I, myself, will kill them, and accomplish my\nobject with my own hand. And after having destroyed them, I will put Oogursen\nto death; because he is very deceitful and desires my destruction. And after\nthat, having first burnt Dewukee\'s father, Dewuk, I will drown him. Having\n\np. 127\n\nthus put Basoodeo to death with him, I will thus destroy by the very roots all\nthe worshippers of Huri. Then, if you will but bring Bulram and Krishnu,\nreigning without any opposition, I will unite with my very powerful friend,\nJoorasindh, from dread of whom, the nine divisions of the world tremble; and\nwith Nurkasoor, and Banasoor, and other great and mighty demons, who are his\nattendants."\n\nKuns continued to urge Akroor, saying, "Go to Brindabun to the house of Nund,\nand tell him, that a sacrifice is about to be made to Shivu; the bow has been\nplaced upon it, and that there will be all kinds of sports and pastimes; on\nhearing this Nund and Oopunud will come with the cowherds, and bring goats and\nbuffaloes to offer as presents, and Krishnu and Buldeo will accompany them to\nsee what goes on. This is the plan I suggest to you for bringing them here.\nHereafter, as you are possessed of great knowledge, if it should be necessary\nto slake up any other story, do so, and act accordingly. What more need I say?\nThere is a saying, If the ambassador is a man of wonderful capacity, who\npossesses understanding and power himself, and is bold in others\' affairs,\nplace implicit confidence in him."\n\nOn hearing these speeches, Akroor thought to himself, "If I were now to speak\nhonestly to him, and give him good advice, he would not listen to it:\nwherefore, it is better that I should now say what may be flattering and\nagreeable to him. There is also a saying, applied in another sense, that we\nshould make speeches, which will please." With these thoughts in his mind,\nAkroor joined his hands, and bowing his head, said, "O great king! you have\ngiven good advice. I give my most full consent and approbation to all you have\nsaid. We have no power over the future. Man busies himself forming many\nprojects: but those alone, which are written in fate, are brought to\ncompletion. The event does not always correspond with our thoughts; and no man\nhas all his wishes fulfilled. You have considered this business,\n\np. 128\n\npredicting the future: we know not what may happen. In compliance with what\nyou have said, I will go off to-morrow morning early, and bring Bulram and\nKrishnu." On saying this, Akroor having obtained the permission of Kuns to\ndepart, came to his own house.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXXVIII](psa39.htm)\n\n'
