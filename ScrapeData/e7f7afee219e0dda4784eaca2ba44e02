Dutt, [1899], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n# RAMAYANA - EPILOGUE BY THE TRANSLATOR\n\nAncient India, like ancient Greece, boasts of two great Epics. The _Maha-\nbharata_ , based on the legends and traditions of a great historical war, is\nthe Iliad of India. The _Ramayana_ , describing the wanderings and adventures\nof a prince banished from his country, has so far something in common with the\nOdyssey. Having placed before English readers a condensed translation of the\nIndian Iliad, I have thought it necessary to prepare the present condensed\ntranslation of the Indian Odyssey to complete the work. The two together\ncomprise the whole of the Epic literature of the ancient Hindus; and the two\ntogether present us with the most graphic and lifelike picture that exists of\nthe civilisation and culture, the political and social life, the religion and\nthought of ancient India.\n\nThe _Ramayana_ , like the _Maha-bharata_ , is a growth of centuries, but the\nmain story is more distinctly the creation of one mind. Among the many\ncultured races that flourished in Northern India about a thousand years before\nChrist, the Kosalas of Oudh and the Videhas of North Behar were perhaps the\nmost cultured. Their Monarchs were famed for their learning as well as for\ntheir prowess, Their priests distinguished themselves by founding schools of\nlearning which were known all over India. Their sacrifices and gifts to the\nlearned drew together the most renowned men of the age from distant regions.\nTheir celebrated Universities (Parishads) were frequented by students from\nsurrounding countries. Their compilations of the old Vedic Hymns were used in\nvarious parts of India. Their elaborate Brahmanas or Commentaries on the Vedas\nwere handed down from generation to generation by priestly families. Their\nresearches into the mysteries of the Soul. and into the nature of the One\nUniversal Soul which pervades the creation, are still preserved in the ancient\nUpanishads, and are among the most valuable heritages which have been left to\nus by the ancients. And their researches and discoveries in science and\nphilosophy gave them the foremost place among the gifted races of ancient\nIndia.\n\nIt would appear that the flourishing period of the Kosalas and the Videhas had\nalready passed away, and the traditions of their prowess and learning had\nbecome a revered memory in India, when the poet composed the great Epic which\nperpetuates their fame. Distance of time lent a higher lustre to the\nachievements of these gifted races, and the age in which they flourished\nappeared to their descendants as the Golden Age of India. To the imagination\nof the poet, the age of the Kosalas and Videhas was associated with all that\nis great and glorious, all that is righteous and true. His description of\nAyodhya, the capital town of the Kossalas, is a description of an ideal seat\nof righteousness. Dasa-ratha the king of the Kosalas is an ideal king,\nlabouring for the good of a loyal people. Rama, the eldest son of Dasa-ratha\nand the hero of the Epic, is an ideal prince, brave and accomplished, devoted\nto his duty, unfaltering in his truth. The king of the Videhas, Janak (or\nrather Janaka, but I have omitted the final a of some names in this\ntranslation), is a monarch and a saint. Sita, the daughter of Janak and the\nheroine of the Epic, is the ideal of a faithful woman and a devoted wife. A\npious reverence for the past pervades the great Epic; a lofty admiration of\nwhat is true and ennobling in the human character sanctifies the work; and\ndelineations of the domestic life and the domestic virtues of the ancient\nHindus, rich in tenderness and pathos, endear the picture to the hearts of the\npeople of India to the present day.\n\nIt is probable that the first connected narrative of this Epic was composed\nwithin a few centuries after the glorious age of the Kosalas and the Videhas.\nBut the work became so popular that it grew with age. It grew,--not like the\n_Maha-Bharata_ by the incorporation of new episodes, tales, and traditions,--\nbut by fresh descriptions of the same scenes and incidents. Generations of\npoets were never tired of adding to the description of scenes which were dear\nto the Hindu, and patient Hindu listeners were never tired of listening to\nsuch repetitions. The virtues of Rama and the faithfulness of Sita were\ndescribed again and again in added lines and cantos. The grief of the old\nmonarch at the banishment of the prince, and the sorrows of the mother at\nparting from her son, were depicted by succeeding versifiers in fresh verses.\nThe loving devotion of Rama\'s brothers, the sanctity of saints, and the peace\nfulness of the hermitages visited by Rama, were described with endless\nreiteration. The long account of the grief of Rama at the loss of his wife,\nand stories of unending battles waged for her recovery, occupied generations\nof busy interpolators.\n\nThe Sloka verse in which much of the Ramayana is composed is the easiest of\nSanscrit, metres, and afforded a fatal facility to poets and often we have the\nsame scene, fully and amply described in one canto, repeated again in the two\nor three succeeding cantos. The unity of the composition is lost by these\nadditions, and the effect of the narrative is considerably weakened by such\nendless repetition. It would appear that the original work ended with the\nsixth Book, which describes the return of the hero to his country and to his\nloving subjects. The seventh Book is called Uttara or Supplemental, and in it\nwe are told something of the dimensions of the poem, apparently after the\nfatal process of additions and interpolations had gone on for centuries. We\nare informed that the poem consists of six Books and a Supplemental Book; and\nthat it comprises 500 cantos and 24,000 couplets. And we are also told in this\nSupplemental Book that the descendants of Rama and his brothers founded some\nof the great towns and states which, we know from other sources, flourished in\nthe fifth and fourth centuries before Christ. It is probable therefore that\nthe Epic, commenced after 1000 B.C., had assumed something like its present\nshape a few centuries before the Christian Era.\n\nThe foregoing account of the genesis and growth of the _Ramayana_ will\nindicate in what respects it resembles the _Maha-Bharata_ , and in what\nrespects the two Indian Epics differ from each other. The _Maha-Bharata_ grew\nout of the legends and. traditions of a great historical war between the Kurus\nand the Panchalas; the _Ramayana_ grew out of the recollections of the golden\nage of the Kosalas and the Videhas. The characters of the _Maha-bharata_ are\ncharacters of flesh and blood, with the virtues and crimes of great actors in\nthe historic world; the characters of the _Ramayana_ are more often the ideals\nof manly devotion to truth, and of womanly faithfulness and love in domestic\nlife. The poet of the _Maha-Bharata_ relies on the real or supposed incidents\nof a war handed down from generation to generation in songs and ballads, and\nweaves them into an immortal work of art the poet of the _Ramayana_ conjures\nup the memories of a golden age, constructs lofty ideals of piety and faith,\nand describes with infinite pathos domestic scones and domestic affections\nwhich endear the work to modern Hindus. As an heroic poem the _Maha-Bharata_\nstands on a higher level; as a poem delineating the softer emotions of our\neveryday life the _Ramayana_ sends its roots deeper into the hearts and minds\nof the million in India.\n\nThese remarks will be probably made clearer by a comparison of what may be\nconsidered parallel passages in two great Epics In heroic description, the\nbridal of Sita is poor and commonplace, compared with the bridal of Draupadi\nwith all the bustle and tumult of a real contest among warlike suitors. The\nrivalry between Rama and Ravan, between Lakshman and Indrajit, is feeble in\ncomparison with the lifelong jealousy and hatred which animated Arjun and\nKama, Bhima and Duryodban. Sita\'s protest and defiance, spoken to Ravan when\nhe carried her away, lack the fire and the spirit of Draupadi\'s appeal on the\noccasion when she was insulted in court. The Council of War held by Ravan is a\npoor affair in comparison with the Council of War held by Yudhisthir in the\nMatsya kingdom. And Bibhishan\'s final appeal for peace and Ravan\'s scornful\nreply will scarcely compare with the sublime eloquence with which Krishna\nimplored the old monarch of the Kurus not to plunge into a disastrous war, and\nthe deep determination with which Duryodhan replied:-\n\n"Town nor village, mart nor hamlet, help us righteous Gods in heaven,  \nSpot that needle\'s point can cover shall not unto them be given!"\n\nIn the whole of the _Ramayana_ there is no character with the fiery\ndetermination and the deep-seated hatred for the foe which inspire Kama or\nArjun, Bhima or Duryodhan. And in the unending battles waged by Rama and his\nallies there is no incident so stirring, so animated, so thrilling, as the\nfall of Abhimanyu, the vengeance of Arjun, the final contest between Arjun and\nKama, or the final contest between Bhima and Duryo dhan. The whole tenor of\nthe _Ramayana_ is subdued and calm, pacific and pious; the whole tenor of the\n_Maha-Bharata_ is warlike and spirited.\n\nAnd yet, without rivalling the heroic grandeur of the _Maha-bharata_ , the\n_Ramayana_ is immeasurably superior in its delineation of those softer and\nperhaps deeper emotions which enter into our everyday life and hold the world\ntogether. And these descriptions, essentially of Hindu life, are yet so true\nto nature that they apply to all races and nations.\n\nThere is something indescribably touching and tender in the description of the\nlove of Rama for his subjects and the loyalty of his people towards Rama,--\nthat loyalty which has ever been a part of the Hindu character in every age--\n\nAs a father to his children to his loving men he came,  \nBlessed our homes and maids and matrons till our infants lisped his name,\n\nFor our humble woes and troubles Rama hath the ready tear,  \nTo our humble tales of suffering Rama lends his willing ear!"\n\nDeeper than this was Rama\'s duty towards his father and his father\'s fondness\nfor Rama; and the portion of the Epic which narrates the dark scheme by which\nthe prince was at last torn from the heart and home of his dying father is one\nof the most powerful and pathetic passages in Indian literature. The\nstepmother of Rama, won by the virtues and the kindliness of the prince,\nregards his proposed coronation with pride and pleasure, but her old nurse\ncreeps into her confidence like a creeping serpent, and envenoms her heart\nwith the poison of her own wickedness. She arouses the slumbering jealousy of\na woman and awakens the alarms of a mother, till--\n\n"Like a slow but deadly poison worked the ancient nurse\'s tears,  \nAnd a wife\'s undying impulse mingled with a mother\'s fears!"\n\nThe nurse\'s dark insinuations work on the mind of the queen till she becomes a\ndesperate woman, resolved to maintain her own influence on her husband, and to\nsee her own son on the throne. The determination of the young queen tells with\nterrible effeect on the weakness and vacillation of the feeble old monarch,\nand Rama is banished at last. And the scene closes with a pathetic story in\nwhich the monarch recounts his misdeed of past years, accepts his present\nsuffering as the fruit of that misdeed, and dies in agony for his banished\nson. The inner workings of the human; heart and of human motives, the dark\nintrigue of a scheming dependant, the awakening jealousy and alarm of a wife\nand a mother, the determination of a woman and an imperious queen, and the\nfeebleness and despair and death of a fond old father and husband,, have never\nbeen more vividly described. Shakespeare himself has not depicted the workings\nof stormy passions in the human heart more graphically or more vividly, with\ngreater truth or with more terrible power.\n\nIt is truth and power in the depicting of such scenes, and not in the\ndelineation of warriors and warlike incidents, that. the _Ramayana_ excels. It\nis in the delineation of domestic incidents, domestic affections, and domestic\njealousies, which are appreciated by the prince and the peasant alike, that\nthe _Ramayana_ bases its appeal to the hearts of the million in India. And\nbeyond all this, the righteous devotion of Rama, and the faith fulness and\nwomanly love of Sita, run like two threads of gold through the whole fabric of\nthe Epic, and ennoble and sanctify the work in the eyes of Hindus,\n\nRama and Sita are the Hindu ideals of a Perfect Man and a Perfect Woman; their\ntruth under trials and temptations, their endurance under privations, and\ntheir devotion to duty under all vicissitudes of fortune, form the Hindu ideal\nof a Perfect Life. In this respect the _Ramayana_ gives us a true picture of\nHindu faith and righteous life as Dante\'s "Divine Comedy" gives us a picture\nof the faith and belief of the Middle Ages in Europe. Our own ideals in the\npresent day may not be the ideals of the tenth century before Christ or the\nfourteenth century after Christ; but mankind will not willingly let die those\ngreat creations of the past which shadow forth the ideals and beliefs of\ninteresting periods in the progress of human civilisation.\n\nSorrow and suffering, trial and endurance, are a part of the Hindu ideal of a\nPerfect Life of righteousness. Rama suffers for fourteen years in exile, and\nis chastened by privations and misfortunes, before he ascends the throne of\nhis father. In a humble way this course of training was passed through by\nevery pious Hindu of the ancient times. Every Aryan boy in India was taken\naway from his parents at an early age, and lived the hard life of an anchorite\nunder his teacher for twelve or twenty-four or thirty-six years, before he\nentered the married life and settled down as a householder. Every Aryan boy\nassumed the rough garment and the staff and girdle of a student, lived as a\nmendicant and begged his food from door to door, attended on his preceptor as\na menial, and thus trained himself in endurance and suffering as well as in\nthe traditional learning of the age, before he became a house holder. The\npious Hindu saw in Rama\'s life the ideal of a true Hindu life, the success and\nthe triumph which follow upon endurance and faith and devotion to duty. It is\nthe truth and endurance of Rama under sufferings and privations which impart\nthe deepest lessons to the Hindu character, and is the highest ideal of a\nHindu righteous life. The ancient ideal may seem to us far-fetched in these\ndays, but we can never fully comprehend the great moral Epic of the Hindus\nunless we endeavour to study fully and clearly its relations of old Hindu\nideas and old Hindu life.\n\nAnd if trial and endurance are a part of a Hindu\'s ideal of a man\'s life,\ndevotion and self-abnegation are still more essentially a part of his ideal of\na woman\'s life. Sita holds a place in the hearts Of women in India which no\nother creation of a poet\'s imagination holds among any other nation on earth.\nThere is not a Hindu man whose earliest and tenderest recollections do not\ncling round the story of Sita\'s sufferings and Sita\'s faithfulness, told in\nthe nursery, taught in the family circle, remembered and cherished through\nlife. Sita\'s adventures in a desolate forest and in a hostile prison only\nrepresent in an exaggerated form the humbler trials of a woman\'s life; and\nSita\'s endurance and faithfulness teach her devotion to duty in all trials and\ntroubles of life. "For," said Sita:\n\nFor my mother often taught me and my father often spake,  \nThat her home the wedded woman doth beside her husband make,  \nAs the shadow to the substance, to her lord is faithful wife,  \nAnd she parts not from her consort till she parts with fleeting life!  \nTherefore bid me seek the jungle and in pathless forests roam,  \nWhere the wild deer freely ranges and the tiger makes his home,  \nHappier than in father\'s mansions in the woods will Sita rove,  \nWaste no thought on home or kindred, nestling in her husband\'s love!"\n\nThe ideal of life was joy and beauty and gladness in ancient Greece; the ideal\nof life was piety and endurance and devotion in ancient India. The tale of\nHelen was a tale of womanly beauty and loveliness which charmed the western\nWorld. The tale of Sita was a tale of womanly faith and self-abnegation which\ncharmed and fascinated the Hindu world. Repeated trials bring out in brighter\nrelief the unfaltering truth of Sita\'s character; she goes to a second\nbanishment in the woods with the same trust and devotion to her lord as\nbefore, and she returns once more, and sinks into the bosom of her Mother\nEarth, true in death as she had been true in life. The creative imagination of\nthe Hindus has conceived no loftier and holier character than Sita; the\nliterature of the world has not produced a higher ideal of womanly love,\nwomanly truth, and womanly devotion.\n\nThe modern reader will now comprehend why India produced, and has preserved\nfor well-nigh three thousand years, two Epics instead of one national Epic. No\nwork of the imagination abides long unless it is animated by some sparks of\nimperishable truth, unless it truly embodies some portion of our human\nfeelings, human faith, and human life. The _Maha-Bharata_ depicts the\npolitical life of ancient India, with all its valour and heroism, ambition and\nlofty chivalry. The _Ramayana_ embodies the domestic and religious life of\nancient India, with all its tenderness and sweetness, its endurance and\ndevotion. The one picture without the other were in complete; and we should\nknow but little of the ancient Hindus if we did not comprehend their inner\nlife and faith as well as their political life and their Warlike virtues. The\ntwo together give us a true and graphic picture of ancient Indian life and\ncivilisation; and no nation on earth has preserved a more faithful picture of\nits glorious past.\n\nIn condensing the _Ramayana_ with its more than 24,000 Sanscrit couplets into\n2,000 English couplets I have followed the same plan which was adopted in my\ntranslation of the Maha-Bharata. I have selected those sections or cantos\nwhich tell the leading incidents of the Epic, and have translated the whole or\nmain portions of them, and these selected passages are linked together by\nshort notes. The plan, as was explained before, has this advantage, that the\nstory is told not by the translator in his own way, but by the poet himself\nthe passages placed before the reader are not the translator\'s abridgment of a\nlong poem, but selected passages from the poem itself. It is the ancient poet\nof India, and not the translator, who narrates the old story; but he narrates\nonly such portions of it as describe the leading incidents. We are told that\nthe sons of Rama recited the whole poem of 24,000 verses, divided into 500\ncantos or sections, in twenty-five days. The modern reader has not the\npatience of the Hindu listener of the old school; but a selection of the\nleading portions of that immortal song, arranged in 2,000 verses and in 84\nshort sections, may possibly receive a hearing, even from the much-distracted\nmodern reader.\n\nWhile speaking of my own translation I must not fail to make some mention of\nmy predecessors in this work. The magnificent edition of the _Ramayana_\n(Bengal recension), published with an Italian translation by Gorresio, at the\nexpense of Charles Albert King of Sardinia in 1843-67, first introduced this\ngreat Epic to the European public; and it was not long before M. Hippolyte\nFauche presented the European world with a French translation of this edition.\nThe Benares recension of the Ramayana has since been lithographed in Bombay,\nand a printed edition of the same recension with Ramanuja\'s commentary was\nbrought out by the venerable Hem Chandra Vidyaratna in Calcutta in 1869-85.\nThe talented and indefatigable Mr. Ralph Griffith, C.I.E., who has devoted a\nlifetime to translating Indian poetry into English, has produced an almost\ncomplete translation of the first six Books in more than 24,000 English\ncouplets, and has given an abstract of the seventh Book in prose. And a\ncomplete translation of the _Ramayana_ into English prose has since appeared\nin Calcutta.\n\nThe object of the present work is very different from that of these\nmeritorious editions and translations. The purpose of this work, as explained\nabove, is not to attempt a complete translation of a voluminous Epic, but to\nplace before the general reader the leading story of that Epic by translating\na number of selected passages and connecting them together by short notes. The\npurpose of this volume is not to repeat the long poem which Rama\'s sons are\nsupposed to have recited in 24,000 Sanscrit couplets, but only to narrate the\nmain incidents of that poem within the reasonable limit of 2,000 verses. And\nthe general reader who seeks for a practical acquaintance with the great\nIndian poem within a reason able compass will, it is hoped, find in this book\na handy and not unacceptable translation of the leading story of the Epic.\n\nI have stated before that in India the _Ramayana_ is still a living tradition\nand a living faith. It forms the basis of the moral instruction of a nation,\nand it is a part of the lives of two hundred millions of people. It is\nnecessary to add that when the modern languages of India were first formed out\nof the ancient Sanscrit and Prakrits, in the ninth and tenth centuries after\nChrist, the Ramayana had the greatest influence in inspiring our modern poets\nand forming our modern tongues. Southern India took the lead, and a\ntranslation of the Ramayana in the Tamil language appeared as early as A.D.\n1100. Northern India and Bengal and Bombay followed the example; Tulasi Das\'s\n_Ramayana_ is the great classic of the Hindi language, Krittibas\'s _Ramayana_\nis a classic in the Bengali language, and Sridhar\'s _Ramayana_ is a classic in\nthe Mahratta language. Generations of Hindus in all parts of India have\nstudied the ancient story in these modern translations; they have heard it\nrecited in the houses of the rich; and they have seen it acted on the stage at\nreligious festivals in every great town and every populous village through the\nlength and breadth of India.\n\nMore than this, the story of Rama has inspired our religious reformers, and\npurified the popular faith of our modern times. Rama, the true and dutiful,\nwas accepted as the Spirit of God descended on earth, as an incarnation of\nVishnu the Preserver of the World. The great teacher Ramanuja proclaimed the\nmonotheism of Vishnu in Southern India in the twelfth century; the reformer\nRamananda proclaimed the same faith in Northern India in the thirteenth or\nfourteenth century; and his follower the gifted Kabir conceived the bold idea\nof uniting Hindus and Mahomedans. in the worship of One God. "The God of the\nHindus," he said, is the God of the Mahomedans, be he invoked as _Rama_ or\n_Ali_." "The city of the Hindu God is Benares, and the city of the Mahomedan\nGod is Mecca; but search your hearts, and there you will find the God both of\nHindus and Mahomedans." "If the Creator dwells in tabernacles, whose dwelling\nis the universe?"\n\nThe reformer Chaitanya preached the same sublime monotheism in Bengal, and the\nreformer Nanak in the Punjab, in the sixteenth century. And down to the\npresent day the popular mind in India, led away by the worship of many images\nin many temples, nevertheless holds fast to the cardinal idea of One God, and\nbelieves the heroes of the ancient Epics-Krishna and Rama-to be the\nincarnations of that God. The various sects of the Hindus, specially the sects\nof Vishnu and of Siva who form the great majority of the people, quarrel about\na name as they often did in Europe in the Middle Ages, and each sect gives to\nthe Deity the special name by which the sect is known. In the teeming villages\nof Bengal, in the ancient shrines of Northern India, and far away in the towns\nand hamlets of Southern India, the prevailing faith of the million is a\npopular monotheism underlying the various ceremonials in honour of various\nimages and forms-and that popular monotheism generally recognises the heroes\nof the two ancient Epics,--Krishna and Rama, as the earthly incarnations of\nthe great God who pervades and rules the universe.\n\nTo know the Indian Epics is to understand the Indian people better. And to\ntrace the influence of the Indian Epics on the life and civilisation of the\nnation, and on the development of their modern languages, literatures, and\nreligious reforms, is to comprehend the real history of the people during\nthree thousand years.\n\nROMESH DUTT.\n\nUNIVERSITY COLLEGE, LONDON,  \n    13 _th_ _August_ 1899.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book I: The Tournament](maha01.htm)\n\n'
