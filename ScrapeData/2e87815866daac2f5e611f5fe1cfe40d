VIII, 2, 1-3, ida _m_ vaso sutam andha _h_ , form the first (pratipad) and\nthe second (anu _k_ ara) of the Marutvatiya hymn.\n\n2\\. Both, as belonging to the one-day ceremonial 2, are perfect in form. On\nthat day much is done now and then which has to be hidden, and has to be\natoned for. Atonement is rest, the one-day sacrifice. Therefore at the end of\nthe year the sacrificers rest on this atonement as their rest. He who knows\nthis rests firm, and they also for whom a Hot _ri_ priest who knows this,\nrecites this hymn 3.\n\n3\\.

The killing of V _ri_ tra is a form (character)\nof Indra, this day (the mahavrata) belongs to Indra, and this is the (perfect)\nform of that day.\n\n8\\. In the (Dhayya) verse tva _m_ soma kratubhi _h_ sukratur bhu _h_ (Rv. I,\n91, 2) the word v _ri_ sha 1, powerful, occurs. Powerful is a form (character)\nof Indra, this day belongs to Indra, and this is the (perfect) form of that\nday.\n\n9\\. In the (Dhayya) verse pinvanty apa _h_ (Rv.

In (the Pragatha) naki _h_ sudaso ratham pary asa na riramad (Rv. VII,\n32, 10) the words paryasa (he moved round) and na riramad (he did not enjoy)\noccur, and as endowed with the words paryasta and ranti the form of this day\nis perfect 1.\n\nHe recites all (these) Pragathas, in order to obtain all the days (of the\nsacrifice), all the Ukthas 2, all the P _ri_ sh _th_ as 3, all the _S_ astras\n4, all the Pra-ugas 5, and all the Savanas (libations).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[166:1](sbe01184.htm#fr_398) In the first adhyaya the two hymns to be recited\nby the Hot _ri_ priest at the morning-libation (the a _g_ ya and pra-uga _s_\nastra) have been considered. Now follows the Marutvatiya hymn, to be recited\nby the Hot _ri_ priest at the noon-libation.\n\n[166:2](sbe01184.htm#fr_399) Taken from the Agnish _t_ oma.\n\n[166:3](sbe01184.htm#fr_400) Cf. I, 1, 3, 7-8.\n\n[166:4](sbe01184.htm#fr_401) All these Pragathas consist of two verses\nexpanded into a t _ri_ _k_ a.\n\n[166:5](sbe01184.htm#fr_402) Hotradaya ukthina _h_ _s_ astri _n_ a _h_.\n\n[167:1](sbe01184.htm#fr_403) Cf. I, 2, 2, 14.\n\n[168:1](sbe01184.htm#fr_404) Because the performance of the Mahavrata\nsacrifice moves the worshipper round to another world and gives him enjoyment.\nComm. It is difficult to surpass the absurdity of these explanations. Na\nriramat means no one stopped the chariot of Sudas. But even if it meant that\nno one rejoiced through the chariot of Sudas, it would be difficult to see how\nthe negative of enjoyment, mentioned in the hymn, could contribute to the\nperfection of a sacrifice which is to confer positive enjoyment on the\nworshipper.\n\n[168:2](sbe01184.htm#fr_405) The stotras following after the Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1aya _g_\n\xc3\xb1iya Saman, serving for the ukthya-kratus.\n\n[168:3](sbe01184.htm#fr_406) The stotras of the noon-libation, to be performed\nwith the Rathantara, B _ri_ hat, and other Samans.\n\n[168:4](sbe01184.htm#fr_407) The _s_ astras, recitations, accompanying the\noblations of a _g_ ya.\n\n[168:5](sbe01184.htm#fr_408) The pra-ugas, a division of _s_ astras, described\nabove.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2, 2](sbe01185.htm)\n\n'
