Wilkins, [1900], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 431\n\n### CHAPTER V.\n\n#### THE PLANETS.\n\n"At the great festivals of the Hindus a small offering is made to all the\nplanets at once; but, excepting on these occasions, they are never worshipped\ntogether. They are, however, frequently worshipped separately by the sick and\nunfortunate who suppose themselves to be under the baneful influence of one or\nother of them. At these times they are worshipped one after the other in\nregular succession." * Seven of the planets give names to the days of the\nweek; the other two represent the ascending and descending nodes. Surya and\nChandra (Soma) have already been noticed at length among the Vedic Deities;\nthey are again described briefly along with the planets, under the names they\nbear in this connection.\n\n"To Surya or Ravi are offered in the burnt sacrifice small pieces of the shrub\n_arka_ ( _Asclepias gigantica_ ); to Chandra those of the _palasa_ ( _Butea\nfrondosa_ ); to Mangala (Mars) those of the _khudiru_ ( _Mimosa catechu_ ); to\nBudha (Mercury) those of the _ap \xc4\x81rm\xc4\x81rga_ ( _Achryranthes aspera_ ); to\nVrihaspati (Jupiter) those of the _asvattha_ ( _Ficus religiosa_ ); to Sukra\n(Venus) those of the _\xc5\xab rumbara;_ to Sani (Saturn) those of the _Sami_ (\n_Mimosa albida_ ); to R\xc4\x81hu (the ascending node) blades of _Durva_  \n\np. 432\n\ngrass; and to Keta (the descending node) blades of _Kusa_ grass." *\n\n"The image of Surya is a round piece of mixed metal twelve fingers in\ndiameter; of Chandra, a piece like a half-moon, a cubic from end to end; of\nMangala, a triangular piece six fingers in width; of Budha, a golden bow two\nfingers in breadth; of Vrihaspati, a piece like a lotus; of Sukra, a square\npiece of silver; of Sani, an iron scimitar; of R\xc4\x81hu, an iron makara (a\nfabulous animal, half stag and half fish); and of Ketu, an iron snake." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\n1\\. Ravi (the Sun), hence Ravib\xc4\x81ra (Sunday), is the son of Kasyapa and Aditi.\nThough as Surya he is daily worshipped, as Ravi he is only worshipped at the\ngreater festivals. "The \'Jyotish-tatwa,\' a great work on astrology, says that\nif a person is born under the planet Ravi, he will possess an anxious mind, be\nsubject to disease and other sufferings, be an exile, a prisoner, and suffer\nthe loss of wife, children, and property." \xe2\x80\xa1\n\n2\\. Chandra or Soma, hence Somav\xc4\x81ra (Monday). "If a person be born under the\nplanet Soma he will have many friends; will possess elephants, horses, and\npalanquins; be honourable and powerful; will live on excellent food, and rest\non superb couches." A race of kings are said to be the descendants of Soma, by\nhis wife Rohini (the Hyades), who are called the children of the moon.\n\n3\\. Mangala, hence Mangalav\xc4\x81ra (Tuesday), is represented as a red man with\nfour arms, riding on a sheep; he wears a red necklace and clothes of the same\ncolour. " If a person be born under the planet Mangala, he will be full of\nanxious thoughts, wounded with offensive weapons, imprisoned, oppressed with\nfear of robbers, fire, etc., and will lose his lands, trees, and good name."\nThis deity is identical with Kartikeya.\n\np. 433\n\n4\\. Budha, * hence Budhav\xc4\x81ra (Wednesday), was the son of Soma by T\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81, the\nwife of Vrihaspati, the preceptor of the gods. At his birth, on the confession\nof his mother that he was Soma\'s son, her husband reduced her to ashes. Brahm\xc4\x81\nafterwards raised her to life, and, being purified by the fire, her husband\nreceived her back. Samudra (the Sea), incensed at his son for the great crime\nof dishonouring his preceptor\'s wife, disinherited him; but owing to his\nsister \xe2\x80\xa0 Lakshmi\'s influence, part of his sin was removed, and he became\nbright as the moon when three days old; and, through her intercession with\nP\xc4\x81rvati, he was restored to heaven, by being placed on Siva\'s forehead, who,\nthus ornamented, went to a feast of the gods. Vrihaspati on seeing Chandra\nagain in heaven was greatly incensed, but was appeased on Brahm\xc4\x81\'s declaring\nthat the lascivious god should be excluded from heaven and placed among the\nstars; and that the sin which had obscured his glory should remain for ever. "\nIf a person be born under the planet Budha, he will be fortunate, obtain an\nexcellent wife," etc.\n\n5\\. Vrihaspati, hence Vrihaspativ\xc4\x81ra (Thursday), was the preceptor of the\ngods, and is regarded as identical with Agni, almost the same epithets being\napplied to both in the Vedic hymns. In later times he is said to be a Rishi, a\nson of Angiras. "If a person be born under this planet, he will be endowed\nwith an amiable disposition, possess palaces, gardens, lands, and be rich in\nmoney and corn. He will possess much religious merit, and have all his wishes\ngratified. Br\xc4\x81hmans, however, will not be so fortunate as those of other\ncastes, for Vrihaspati\n\np. 434\n\nbeing a Br\xc4\x81hman does not wish to exalt those of his own caste."\n\n6\\. Sukra, hence Sukrav\xc4\x81ra (Friday), was the son of Bhrigu. He was the\npreceptor and the priest of the demons, and blind in one eye. The reason of\nthis affliction is told in the following legend: When Vishnu, in the Dwarf\nIncarnation, went to B\xc4\x81li, king of the daityas, to solicit a blessing, Sukra,\nas B\xc4\x81li\'s preceptor, forbade the king to give him anything. The king being\ndetermined to give what was asked, it was the duty of the priest to read the\ncustomary formula and to pour out water from a vessel as a ratification of the\ngift. Sukra, anxious to prevent his master from giving what was asked, as he\nforesaw that it would prove his ruin, entered the water in an invisible form,\nand by his magical powers prevented it from falling. Vishnu, aware of the\ndevice, put a straw into the vessel, which, entering Sukra\'s eye, gave him so\nmuch pain that he could remain there no longer; so the water fell, the gift\nwas ratified, and Sukra lost an eye. "If a person be born under the planet\nSukra, he will have the faculty of knowing things past, present, and future.\nHe will have many wives, a kingly umbrella (an emblem of royalty), and other\nkings will worship him."\n\nSukra is said to have possessed the power of raising the dead, as the\nfollowing legend * shows:--Devaj\xc4\x81ni, the daughter of Sukra, was deeply in love\nwith Kacha, a son of Vrihaspati and a pupil of her father, who had been sent\nto Sukra for the express purpose of learning from him the incantation for\nraising the dead. One day Devaj\xc4\x81ni sent Kacha to gather flowers from a wood\nbelonging to some giants, who, on previous occasions had eaten him; but Sukra,\nby the above incantation, had\n\np. 435\n\nrestored him to life. The giants now resolved to make Sukra himself eat the\nboy; for which purpose, they cut him into small pieces, boiled him in spirits,\nand invited Sukra to an entertainment. As Kacha did not return with the\nflowers, Devaj\xc4\x81ni with many tears told her father that, if he did not restore\nher lover, she would certainly destroy herself. Sukra learned by the power of\nmeditation that he had eaten the boy, but did not know how to restore him to\nlife, without the attempt being fatal to himself. At length, whilst the boy\nwas in his stomach, he restored him to life, and then taught him the\nincantation he was so wishful to learn. Kacha, tearing open Sukra\'s stomach,\ncame forth, and immediately using the wonderful incantation restored his\nteacher to life.\n\n7\\. Sani, hence Saniv\xc4\x81ra (Saturday), is said to be the son of Surya, and\nChh\xc4\x81ya, the servant whom his wife Savarn\xc4\x81 substituted for herself; or,\naccording to other accounts, he sprang from Balar\xc4\x81ma and Revati. He is\nrepresented as a black man, clothed in black garments, riding on a vulture,\nwith four arms. "If a person be born under the planet Sani, he will be\nslandered, his riches dissipated, his son, wife, and friends destroyed; he\nwill live at variance with others and endure many sufferings." Many stories\nare told of his evil influence, consequently the Hindus are under fear of evil\nfrom this planet. It was Sani who was said to have burnt off Ganesa\'s head.\n\n8\\. R\xc4\x81hu (the ascending node) was the son of Vrihaspati and Sinhik\xc4\x81. He is\ndescribed as a black man, riding on a lion. "If a person be born under the\nplanet R\xc4\x81hu, his wisdom, riches, and children will be destroyed; he will be\nexposed to many afflictions and be subject to his enemies." According to the\npopular notions of the Hindus, at the time of an eclipse R\xc4\x81hu devours the sun\nand moon; hence, as soon as an eclipse is noticed, the\n\np. 436\n\npeople make a dreadful noise, shouting, blowing horns, and beating drums, to\ncause R\xc4\x81hu to restore these luminaries. The reason of this custom is probably\nfound in the following story: R\xc4\x81hu was originally an asura or giant, who took\nhis present form at the churning of the sea. As the gods and demons churned,\nSurya and Chandra, who were sitting together, hinted to Vishnu, when the\namrita appeared, that one of the demons had tasted it. Vishnu immediately cut\noff the head of the offender; but as he had drunk of the water of life,\nneither head nor trunk could perish. The head, taking the name of R\xc4\x81hu, and\nthe trunk, that of Ketu, were placed in heaven as the ascending and descending\nnodes, and leave was granted, as a means of revenge on Surya and Chandra, that\non certain occasions R\xc4\x81hu should approach these gods and render them unclean,\nso that their bodies at these times become thin and black. *\n\n![](img/43600.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[431:*](hmvp42.htm#fr_393) Ward, E. 70.\n\n[432:*](hmvp42.htm#fr_394) Ward, ii. 70.\n\n[432:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp42.htm#fr_395) Ibid., 71.\n\n[432:\xe2\x80\xa1](hmvp42.htm#fr_396) Page 72.\n\n[433:*](hmvp42.htm#fr_397) This Budha must not be confounded with Buddha, the\nIncarnation of Vishnu.\n\n[433:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp42.htm#fr_398) Soma (the Moon) and Lakshmi were produced together\nat the churning of the ocean.\n\n[434:*](hmvp42.htm#fr_399) Ward, ii. 71.\n\n[436:*](hmvp42.htm#fr_400) Ward, ii. 81.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VI.
