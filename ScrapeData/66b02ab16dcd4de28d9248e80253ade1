Sing forth, O Ka _n_ vas, to the sportive host of your Maruts, brilliant\non their chariots, and unscathed [1](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:1:1),--\n\n2\\. They who were born together, self-luminous, with the spotted deer (the\nclouds) [1](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:2:1), the spears, the daggers, the glittering\nornaments [2](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:2:2).\n\n3\\. I hear their [1](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:3:1) whips, almost close by, when\nthey crack them in their hands; they gain splendour\n[2](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:3:2) on their way [3](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:3:3).\n\n4\\. Sing forth the god-given prayer to the wild [1](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:4:1)\nhost of your Maruts, endowed with terrible vigour [2](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:4:2)\nand strength.\n\n5\\. Celebrate the bull among the cows (the storm among the clouds)\n[1](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:5:1), for it is the sportive host of the Maruts; he\ngrew as he tasted the rain [2](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:5:2).\n\n6\\. Who, O ye men, is the strongest among you here, ye shakers of heaven and\nearth, when you shake them like the hem of a garment\n[1](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:6:1)?\n\n7\\. At your approach the son of man holds himself down; the gnarled cloud\n[1](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:7:1) fled at your fierce anger.\n\n8\\. They at whose racings [1](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:8:1) the earth, like a hoary\nking, trembles for fear on their ways,\n\n9\\. Their birth is strong indeed: there is strength to come forth from their\nmother, nay, there is vigour twice enough for it [1](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:9:1).\n\n10\\. And these sons, the singers [1](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:10:1), stretched out\nthe fences in their racings [2](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:10:2); the cows had to\nwalk knee-deep.\n\np. 64\n\n11\\. They cause this long and broad unceasing rain\n[1](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:11:1) to fall on their ways.\n\n12\\. O Maruts, with such strength as yours, you have caused men to tremble\n[1](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:12:1), you have caused the mountains to tremble.\n\n13\\. As the Maruts pass [1](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:13:1) along, they talk\ntogether on the way: does any one hear them?\n\n14\\. Come fast on your quick steeds! there are worshippers\n[1](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:14:1) for you among the Ka _n_ vas: may you well\nrejoice among them.\n\n15\\. Truly there is enough for your rejoicing. We always are their servants,\nthat we may live even the whole of life.\n\np. 65\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThis hymn is ascribed to Ka _n_ va, the son of Ghora.\n\nVerse 1 = TS. IV, 3, 13, 6.\n\nVerse 3 = SV. I, 135.\n\nVerse 10 = SV. I, 221.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nWilson: Celebrate, Ka _n_ vas, the aggregate strength of the Maruts, sportive,\nwithout horses, but shining in their car.\n\nBenfey: Ka _n_ viden, auf! begrusst mit Sang, die muntre Heerschaar der\nMarut's, die rasch'ste, wagenglanzende.\n\nLudwig: Eurer spilenden schar, der Marutschar, der unangreifbaren, die auf\nwagen glanzt, der singt, o Ka _n_ vas, zu.\n\nNote 1. Wilson translates anarva\xc2\xb4 _n_ am by without horses, though the\ncommentator distinctly explains the word by without an enemy. A Brahma _n_ a\npassage explains: bhrat _ri_ vyo va arva, ity _s_ rutyantarat. See TS. IV, 3,\n13, 6. Wilson considers it doubtful whether arvan can ever mean enemy. The\nfact is, that in the Rig-veda an-arvan never means without horses, but always\nwithout hurt or free from enemies; and the commentator is perfectly right, as\nfar as the sense is concerned, in rendering the word by without an enemy, or\nunopposed (apraty- _ri_ ta). An-arvan is not formed from arvat, horse, racer,\nbut from arvan; and this is derived from the same root which yields arus, n. a\nwound, _ri_ ti (see I, 64, 15, note), &c. The accusative of anarvat, without a\nhorse, would be anarvantam, not anarva _n_ am.\n\nThe root ar, in the sense of hurting, is distantly connected with the root\nmar: see Lectures on the Science of Language, Second Series, p. 323. It exists\nin the Greek \xe1\xbd\x84\xce\xbb\xce\xbb\xcf\x85\xce\xbc\xce\xb9 corresponding to Sanskrit _ri_ _n_ omi, i. e. ar _n_ omi,\nI hurt, likewise\n\np. 66\n\nin \xce\xbf\xe1\xbd\x90\xce\xbb\xe1\xbd\xb5, wound, which cannot be derived from \xe1\xbd\x85\xce\xbb\xce\xb7; in \xce\xbf\xe1\xbd\x96\xce\xbb\xce\xbf\xcf\x82, \xce\xbf\xe1\xbd\x94\xce\xbb\xce\xb9\xce\xbf\xcf\x82, hurtful,\nand \xe1\xbd\x80\xce\xbb\xce\xbf\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x82, destructive: see Curtius, Grundzuge der Griechischen Etymologie\n(funfte Ausgabe), p. 372. In the Veda ar has the sense of offending or\ninjuring, particularly if preceded by upa.\n\nX, 164, 3. yat a- _s_ asa ni _h_ - _s_ asa abhi- _s_ asa upa-arima _g_ a\xc2\xb4grata\n_h_ yat svapanta _h_ , agni _h_ vi _s_ vani apa du _h_ -k _ri_ ta\xc2\xb4ni a _g_ ush\n_t_ ani are asmat dadhatu.\n\nIf we have offended, or whatever fault we have committed, by bidding, blaming,\nor forbidding, while waking or while sleeping, may Agni remove all wicked\nmisdeeds far from us.\n\nHence upara, injury, VII, 86, 6. asti _g_ ya\xc2\xb4yan kaniyasa _h_ upa-are, the\nolder man is there to injure, to offend, to mislead, the young: (History of\nAncient Sanskrit Literature, second edition, p. 541.) Roth translates upara by\nVerfehlung, missing. Ari, enemy, too, is best derived from this root, and not\nfrom ra, to give, with the negative particle, as if meaning originally, as\nSaya _n_ a supposes, a man who does not give. In ararivan, gen. ararusha _h_ ,\nhostile, Rosen recognised many years ago a participle of a really reduplicated\nperfect of ar, and he likewise traced araru, enemy, back to the same root: see\nhis note to I, 18, 3.\n\nFrom this root ar, to hurt, arvan, hurting, as well as arus, wound, are\nderived in the same manner as both dhanvan and dhanus, bow, are formed from\ndhan; ya _g_ van and ya _g_ us from ya _g_ , parvan and parus from par. See\nKuhn, Zeitschrift, vol. ii, p. 233.\n\nAnarvan, then, is the same as anarus, _S_ at. P. Brahma _n_ a III, 1, 3, 7;\nand from meaning originally without a wound or without one who can wound, it\ntakes the more general sense of uninjured, invulnerable, perfect, strong, (cf.\ninteger, intact, and entire.) This meaning is applicable to I, 94, 2; 136, 5;\nII, 6, 5; V, 49, 4; VII, 20, 3; 97, 5; X, 61, 13; 65, 3. In I, 116, 16,\nanarvan seems to be used as an adverb; in I, 51, 12, as applied to _s_ loka,\nit may have the more general meaning of irresistible, powerful.\n\nThere are two passages in which the nom. sing. arvan, and one in which the\nacc. sing. arva _n_ am, occur, apparently\n\np. 67\n\nmeaning horse. But in I, 163, 13, and IX, 97, 25, arvan stands in the Pada\ntext only, the Sa _m_ hita has arva\xcc\x90 a _k_ _kh_ a and arva\xcc\x90 iva. In X, 46, 5,\nthe text hiri- _s_ ma _s_ rum na arva _n_ am dhana-ar _k_ am is too doubtful\nto allow of any safe induction, particularly as the Sama-veda gives a totally\ndifferent reading. I do not think, therefore, that arvat, horse, admits in the\nnom. and acc. sing. of any forms but arva and arvantam a. Pa _n_ ini (VI, 4,\n127) allows the forms arvan and arva _n_ am, but in anarvan only, which, as we\nsaw, has nothing in common with arvat, horse. Benfey: 'die rascheste (keinen\nRenner habend, uneinholbar),' the quickest (having no racer, hence not to be\nreached). M. Bergaigne (Journ. As. 1884, p. 188) tries to defend anarvan in\nthe sense of ana _s_ va, without considering the grammatical objections. In\nVI, 66, 7 (not I, 6, 7) ana _s_ va _h_ does not refer to yama _h_.\n\nThe masculine anarva\xc2\xb4 _n_ am after the neuter _s_ ardhas is curious; _s_\nardhas means might, but it is here used to express a might or an aggregate of\nstrong men or gods, and the nom. plur. ye, who, in the next verse, shows the\nsame transition of thought, not only from the singular to the plural, but also\nfrom the neuter to the masculine, which must be admitted in anarva\xc2\xb4 _n_ am b.\nIt would be possible, if necessary, to explain away the irregularity of\nanarva\xc2\xb4 _n_ am by admitting a rapid transition from the Maruts to Indra, the\neldest among the Maruts (cf. I, 23, 8. indra gyesh _th_ a _h_ marut-ga _n_ a\n_h_ ), and it would be easier still to alter _s_ ardhas into _s_ ardham, as an\naccusative singular of the masculine noun _s_ ardha, which has the same\nmeaning as the neuter _s_ ardhas. There is one passage, V, 56, 9, which would\nseem to give ample countenance to such a conjecture:\n\ntam va _h_ _s_ ardham rathe- _s_ ubham--a\xc2\xb4 huve.\n\nI call hither this your host, brilliant on chariots.\n\nAgain, II, 30, u, we read:\n\ntam va _h_ _s_ ardham ma\xc2\xb4rutam--gira\xc2\xb4 upa bruve.\n\nI call with my voice on this your host of Maruts.\n\np. 68\n\nVIII, 93, 16. _s_ rutam va _h_ v _ri_ trahan-tamam pra _s_ ardham _k_ arsha\n_n_ ina\xc2\xb4m, a\xc2\xb4 _s_ ushe.\n\nI pant for the glorious, victorious, host of the quick Maruts.\n\nFrom this _s_ ardha we have also the genitive _s_ ardhasya, VII, 56, 8 (4):\n\n_s_ ubhra _h_ va _h_ _s_ ushma _h_ krudhmi mana _m_ si dhuni _h_ muni _h_ iva\n_s_ ardhasya dh _ri_ sh _n_ o _h_.\n\nYour prowess is brilliant, your minds furious; the shout of the daring host is\nlike one possessed.\n\nWe have likewise the dative _s_ ardhaya, the instrumental _s_ ardhena, and the\nacc. plur. _s_ ardhan; and in most cases, except in two or three where _s_\nardha seems to be used as an adjective, meaning strong, these words are\napplied to the host of the Maruts.\n\nBut the other word _s_ ardhas is equally well authenticated, and we find of\nit, not only the nominative, accusative, and vocative sing. _s_ ardhas, but\nlikewise the nom. plur. _s_ ardha _m_ si.\n\nThe nominative singular occurs in our very hymn:\n\nI, 37, 5. kri _l_ am yat _s_ ardha _h_ ma\xc2\xb4rutam.\n\nWhich is the sportive host of the Maruts.\n\nI, 127, 6. sa _h_ hi _s_ ardha _h_ na ma\xc2\xb4rutam tuvi-svani _h_.\n\nFor he (Agni) is strong-voiced like the host of the Maruts.\n\nIV, 6, 10. tuvi-svanasa _h_ ma\xc2\xb4rutam na _s_ ardha _h_.\n\nThy flames (Agni) are strong-voiced like the host of the Maruts.\n\nV, 46, 5. uta tyat na _h_ ma\xc2\xb4rutam _s_ ardha _h_ a\xc2\xb4 gamat.\n\nMay also that host of the Maruts come to us.\n\nII, 1, 5. tvam nara\xc2\xb4m _s_ ardha _h_ asi puru-vasu _h_.\n\nThou (Agni), full of riches, art the host of the men.\n\nThis host of men seems to me intended again for the Maruts, although it is\ntrue that in thus identifying Agni with different gods, the poet repeats\nhimself in the next verse:\n\nII, 1, 6. tvam sardha _h_ ma\xc2\xb4rutam.\n\nThou art the host of the Maruts.\n\nIf this repetition seems offensive, the first nara\xc2\xb4m _s_ ardhas might be taken\nfor some other company of gods. Thus we find:\n\np. 69\n\nVII, 44, 5. _s_ _ri_ notu na _h_ daivyam _s_ ardha _h_ agni _h_ i s _ri_ _n_\nvantu vi _s_ ve mahisha\xc2\xb4 _h_ amura _h_.\n\nMay the divine host, may Agni, hear us, may the Vi _s_ ve hear us, the strong,\nthe wise.\n\nOr III, 19, 4. sa _h_ a\xc2\xb4 vaha deva-tatim yavish _th_ a _s_ ardha _h_ yat adya\ndivyam ya _g_ asi.\n\nBring thou hither, O Agni, the gods, that you may sacrifice to-day to the\ndivine host.\n\nOr I, 139, 1. a\xc2\xb4 nu tat _s_ ardha _h_ divyam v _ri_ _n_ imahe.\n\nWe chose for us now that divine host.\n\nAs in these last, so in many other passages, _s_ ardhas is used as a neuter in\nthe accusative. For instance,\n\nI, 106, 1; II, 11, 14. ma\xc2\xb4rutam sardha _h_.\n\nII, 3, 3; VI, 3, 8. _s_ ardha _h_ marutam.\n\nThe vocative occurs,\n\nV, 46, 2. agne indra varu _n_ a mitra deva _h_ _s_ ardha _h_ pra yanta ma\xc2\xb4ruta\nuta vish _n_ o (iti).\n\nAgni, Indra, Varu _n_ a, Mitra, gods, host of the Maruts, come forth, and Vish\n_n_ u!\n\nWe see how throughout all these passages those in which _s_ ardha and _s_\nardhas are applied to the Maruts, or to some other company of gods,\npreponderate most decidedly. Yet passages occur in the Rig-veda where both _s_\nardha, and _s_ ardhas are applied to other hosts or companies. Thus V, 53, 10,\n_s_ ardha refers to chariots, while in I, 133, 3, sardhas is applied to evil\nspirits.\n\nIf the passages hitherto examined were all that occur in the Rig-veda, we\nmight still feel startled at the construction of our verse, where _s_ ardhas\nis not only followed by masculine adjectives in the singular, but, in the next\nverse, by a pronoun in the plural. But if we take the last irregularity first,\nwe find the same construction, viz. sardhas followed by ye, in III, 32, 4:\n\nindrasya _s_ ardha _h_ maruta _h_ ye a\xc2\xb4san.\n\nThe host of Indra, that was the Maruts.\n\nAs to the change of genders, we find adjectives in the masculine after _s_\nardhas, in\n\nV, 52, 8. sardha _h_ ma\xc2\xb4rutam ut sa _m_ sa satya- _s_ avasam _r i_bhvasam.\n\np. 70\n\nCelebrate the host of the Maruts, the truly vigorous, the brilliant.\n\nHere, too, the poet afterwards continues in the plural, though as he uses the\ndemonstrative, and not, as in our passage, the relative pronoun, we cannot\nquote this in support of the irregularity which has here to be explained.\nAnyhow the construction of our verse, though bold and unusual, is not so\nunusual as to force us to adopt conjectural remedies. In V, 58, 2, we find ye\nafter ga _n_ a _h_. On the Umbrian \xc3\x87erfo Martio, as possibly the same as _s_\nardha-s ma\xc2\xb4ruta-s, see Grassman, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. xvi, p. 190. The\nZend _s_ aredha, kind, species, is the same word.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nWilson: Who, borne by spotted deer, were born self-radiant, with weapons, war-\ncries, and decorations.\n\nBenfey: Die mit Hirschen and Speeren gleich mit Donnern and mit Blitzen auch--\nselbststrahlende--geboren sind.\n\nLudwig: Die mit vilfarbigen speeren, mit der schwerter glanze, sichtbar wurden\nmit eignem leuchten.\n\nNote 1. The spotted deer (p _r i_shati) are the recognised animals of the\nMaruts, and were originally, as it would seem, intended for the rain-clouds.\nSaya _n_ a is perfectly aware of the original meaning of p _r i_shati, as\nclouds. The legendary school, he says, takes them for deer with white spots,\nthe etymological school for many-coloured lines of clouds: (RV. BH. I, 64, 8.)\nThis passage shows that although p _r i_shati, as Roth observes, may mean a\nspotted cow or a spotted horse,--the Maruts, in fact, are called sometimes p\n_ri_ shat-a _s_ va _h_ , having piebald horses, or, having p _ri_ shats for\ntheir horses, VII, 40, 3,--yet the later tradition in India had distinctly\ndeclared in favour of spotted deer. The Vedic poets, however, admitted both\nideas, and they speak in the same hymn, nay, in the same verse, of the fallow\ndeer and of the horses of the Maruts. Thus V, 58, 1, the Maruts are called a\n_s_ u-a _s_ va _h_ , possessed of quick horses; and in V, 58, 6, we read yat\npra ayasish _t_ a p _r i_shatibhi _h_ a _s_ vai _h_ --rathebhi _h_ , where the\ngender of p _r i_shatibhi _h_\n\np. 71\n\nwould hardly allow us to join it with asvai _h_ , but where we must translate:\nWhen you come with the deer, the horses, the chariots, or with your deer, as\nhorses. Ludwig joins p _ri_ shatibhi _h_ with _ri_ sh _t_ ibhi _h_ , and again\nin I, 64, 8; see note i to I, 87, 4.\n\nNote 2. The spears and daggers of the Maruts are meant for the thunderbolts,\nand the glittering ornaments for the lightning. Saya _n_ a takes va\xc2\xb4 _s_ i in\nthis passage for war-cries on the authority of the Nirukta, where va\xc2\xb4 _s_ i is\ngiven among the names of the voice. From other passages, however, it becomes\nclear that va\xc2\xb4 _s_ i is a weapon of the Maruts; and Saya _n_ a, too, explains\nit sometimes in that sense: cf. V, 53, 4; 57, 2. Thus I, 88, 3, the va\xc2\xb4 _s_ is\nare spoken of as being on the bodies of the Maruts. In V, 53, 4, the Maruts\nare said to shine in their ornaments and their va\xc2\xb4 _s_ is. Here Saya _n_ a,\ntoo, translates va\xc2\xb4 _s_ i rightly by weapon; and in his remarks on I, 88, 3,\nhe says that va\xc2\xb4 _s_ i was a weapon commonly called ara, which is a\nshoemaker's awl. See Dhammapada, ver. 401. This reminds one of framea, which\nat one time was supposed to he connected with the German pfrieme. See,\nhowever, Grimm (Deutsche Grammatik, vol. i, p. 128) and Leo Meyer (Kuhn's\nZeitschrift, vol. vi, p. 424). In VIII, 29, 3, the god Tvash _t_ ar is said to\ncarry an iron va\xc2\xb4 _s_ i in his hand. Grassman (Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. xvi,\np. 163) translates va\xc2\xb4 _s_ i by axe. That is to be taken in the sense of\nornament, and not in the sense of ointment, is shown by passages like VIII,\n29, 1, where a golden ornament is mentioned, a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ i a\xe1\xb9\x85kte hira _n_ yayam.\nSakam, together, is used with reference to the birth of the Maruts; see I, 64,\n4. It should not be connected with va\xc2\xb4 _s_ ibhi _h_.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nWilson: I hear the cracking of the whips in their hands, wonderfully inspiring\n(courage) in the fight.\n\nBenfey: Schier hier erschallt der Peitsche Knall, wenn sie in ihrer Hand\nerklingt; leuchtend fahr'n sie im Sturm herab.\n\nLudwig: Als ware es hier, so hort man es, wenn die geisslen in ihren handen\nknallen; wunderbar strecken sie auf ihrer fart sich nieder.\n\np. 72\n\nNote 1. Esham should be pronounced as a creticus; also in verses 9, 13, 15.\nThis is a very common vyuha. On the whips as lightning, see Grimm, Donner, p.\n27.\n\nNote 2. I should have taken _k_ itram as an adverb, like Benfey, if ni _ri_\n_\xc3\xb1_ _g_ were not usually construed with an accusative. _Ri_ _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ in the 3rd\npers. plur. pres. \xc3\x82tm. is treated like a verb of the Ad-class. The SV. seems\nto read yamam, and the commentator explains it by ratham.\n\nNote 3. The locative ya\xc2\xb4man is frequently used of the path on which the gods\nmove and approach the sacrifice; hence it sometimes means, as in our passage,\nin the sky. Ya\xc2\xb4mam in BR., s. v. ar _g_ , is wrong.\n\nWe might also translate: 'Here, close by, I hear what the whips in their hands\nsay; they drive forth the beautiful (chariot) on the road.' See SV. I, 2, 1,\n5, 1, comm.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nWilson: Address the god-given prayer to those who are your strength, the\ndestroyers of foes, the powerful, possessed of brilliant reputation.\n\nBenfey: Singt eurer Schaar, der wuhlenden, der strahlenreichen, kraftigen ein\ngotterfulletes Gebet!\n\nLudwig: Eurer kunen schar, von blendender herlichkeit, der kraftvollen, soll\nein von den gottern eingegebenes brahma gesungen werden.\n\nNote 1. Benfey translates gh _r i_shvi by burrowing, and refers it to the\nthunderbolt that uproots the earth. He points out that gh _r i_shvi means\nalso, for the same reason, the boar, as proved by Kuhn (Die Herabkunft des\nFeuers, S. 202). Gh _ri_ sh _t_ i is evidently a common name for boar, the\nNorse griss, and the god of the wind, Grimnir or Grimr, is conceived as a\nboar, shaking the cornfield, in such phrases as 'Der Eber geht ins Korn'\n(Gentha, l. c. p. 14). I prefer, however, in this place the general sense\nassigned to the adjective gh _r i_shu and gh _r i_shvi, exuberant, brisk,\nwild. See Kuhn in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. xi, p. 385. Wilson, after Saya _n_\na, translates destroyers of foes. On the representation of the clouds as\nboars, see Nir. V, 4.\n\nNote 2. Tvesha-dyumna is difficult to render. Both\n\np. 73\n\ntvesha and dyumna are derived from roots that mean to shine, to be bright, to\nglow. Derivatives from tvish express the idea of fieriness, fierceness, and\nfury. In IV, 17, 2, tvish is used correlatively, with manyu, wrath.\nDerivatives from dyu convey the idea of brightness and briskness. Both\nqualities are frequently applied to the Maruts.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nWilson: Praise the sportive and resistless might of the Maruts, who were born\namongst kine, and whose strength has been nourished by (the enjoyment of) the\nmilk.\n\nBenfey: Preist hoch die muntre Marutschaar die unbesiegbar in den Kuh'n, im\nSchlund des Safts wuchs sie heran.\n\nLudwig: Preise wie unter kuhen den stier, (so) der Marut spilende schar, beim\nverschlingen des saftes ist sie grosz geworden.\n\nNote 1. This translation is merely conjectural. I suppose that the wind\ndriving the clouds before him, is here compared to a bull among cows, cf. V,\n52, 3:\n\nte syandra\xc2\xb4sa _h_ na uksha _n_ a _h_ ati skandanti _s_ arvari _h_.\n\nThey, the Maruts, like rushing bulls, mount on the dark cows.\n\nThe last sentence states that the wind grows even stronger after it has tasted\nthe rain (I, 85, 2. te ukshita\xc2\xb4sa _h_ mahima\xc2\xb4nam a _s_ ata).\n\nNote 2. I take _g_ ambhe in the sense of _g_ ambhane. (On the root _g_ abh and\nits derivatives, see Kuhn, Zeitschrift fur vergleichende Sprachwissenschaft,\nvol. i, p. 123 seq.) It would be better to read mukhe, instead of sukhe, in\nthe commentary. The Maruts were not born of milk for P _ri_ _s_ ni, as Wilson\nsays in a note, but from the milk of P _ri_ _s_ ni. P _ri_ _s_ ni is called\ntheir mother, Rudra their father: (V, 52, 16; 60, 5.)\n\nBenfey takes the cows for clouds in which the lightnings dwell; and the abyss\nof the sap is by him supposed to be again the clouds.\n\np. 74\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nWilson: Which is chief leader among you, agitators of heaven and earth, who\nshake all around, like the top (of a tree)?\n\nBenfey: Wer, Helden! ist der erste euch--ihr Erd- und Himmel-schu\xc2\xb4tterer!--\nwenn ihr sie schu\xc2\xb4ttelt Wipfeln gleich?\n\nLudwig: Wer ist der gro\xc2\xb4sste bei euch, helden, wenn vom himel und der erde,\nschu\xc2\xb4tteler, ihr am saume gleichsam ru\xc2\xb4ttelt!\n\nNote 1. \xc3\x81ntam na, literally, like an end, is explained by Saya _n_ a as the\ntop of a tree. Wilson, Langlois, and Benfey accept that interpretation. Roth\nproposes, like the hem of a garment, which I prefer; for vastranta, the end of\na garment, is a common expression in later Sanskrit, while anta is never\napplied to a tree in the sense of the top of a tree. Here agra would be more\nappropriate.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nWilson: The householder, in dread of your fierce and violent approach, has\nplanted a firm (buttress); for the many-ridged mountain is shattered (before\nyou).\n\nBenfey: Vor eurem Gange beuget sich, vor eurem wilden Zorn der Mann; der Hugel\nweichet und der Berg.\n\nLudwig: Vor eurem anzug, eurem gewaltigen eifer, niederduckte sich der mensch,\nwich der festgeknotete [wolken]berg.\n\nNote 1. Saya _n_ a translates: 'Man has planted a firm buttress to give\nstability to his dwelling.' The reading ni for ni, which Aufrecht adopted, is\nuntenable, as Ludwig shows. It has been altered in the second edition. See\nalso VIII, 7, 5, ni yemire. Nidadhre is the perfect \xc3\x82tmanepada, and expresses\nthe holding down of the head or the cowering attitude of man. I have taken\nugra\xc2\xb4ya manyave over to _g_ ihita, because these words could hardly form an\napposition to ya\xc2\xb4maya. As the Vedic poets speak of the very mountains as\nshaken by the storms, we might translate parvato giri _h_ by the gnarled or\nrocky mount;\n\np. 75\n\nbut there is no authority for translating _g_ ihita by it is shattered, and we\nshould have to translate, the mountain yielded or bent before your anger. Cf.\nV, 57, 3:\n\nni va _h_ vana _g_ ihate ya\xc2\xb4mana _h_ bhiya\xc2\xb4.\n\nThe forests get out of your way from fear.\n\nV, 60, 2. vana _k_ it ugra _h_ _g_ ihate ni va _h_ bhiya\xc2\xb4 p _ri_ thivi\xc2\xb4 _k_ it\nre _g_ ate parvata _h_ _k_ it.\n\nEven the forests, ye fearful Maruts, yield from fear of you; even the earth\ntrembles, even the mountain.\n\nIn I, 166, 5, yat tvesha-yama _h_ nadayanta parvatan, we may translate 'when\nthey on their fiery course made the parvatas (clouds) to sound or thunder,'\nbut it is more likely that nadayati here means to cause to shake or vibrate,\nand that parvata stands for mountain. We ought to remember such poetical\nexpressions as 1 Kings xix. 11, 'and a great, strong wind rent the mountains,\nand brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord.'\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nWilson: At whose impetuous approach earth trembles; like an enfeebled monarch,\nthrough dread (of his enemies).\n\nBenfey: Bei deren Lauf bei deren Sturm die Erde zittert voller Furcht, wie ein\naltergebeugter Mann.\n\nLudwig: Bei deren marschen zitterte wie ein gealtet stammeshaupt die erd vor\nfurcht auf ihren wegen.\n\nNote 1. \xc3\x81 _g_ ma seems to express the act of racing or running (like a _g_ i,\nrace, battle), while ya\xc2\xb4ma is the road itself where the racing takes place. A\nvery similar passage occurs in I, 87, 3. The comparison of the earth (fem.) to\na king (masc.) would be considered a grave offence in the later Sanskrit\nliterature. In I, 87, 3, vithura\xc2\xb4 takes the place of vi _s_ pati.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nWilson: Stable is their birthplace, (the sky); yet the birds (are able) to\nissue from (the sphere of) their parent: for your strength is everywhere\n(divided) between two (regions,--or, heaven and earth).\n\np. 76\n\nBenfey: Kaum geboren sind sie so stark, dass ihrer Mutter sie entfliehn: ist\nja doch zwiefach ihre Kraft.\n\nLudwig: Denn fest ist ihr geburtsort, vogel (sind sie) von der mutter\nfortzugehn, nach dem, wie von altersher ihre kraft.\n\nOder, Denn fest ist ihre kraft geworden von der mutter sich zu trennen, da\nschon von alters her ihre kraft diss wollte.\n\nNote 1. A very difficult verse. The birth of the Maruts is frequently alluded\nto, as well as their surpassing strength, as soon as born. Hence the first\nsentence admits of little doubt. But what follows is very abrupt. Vayas may be\nthe plural of vi, bird, or it may be vayas, the neuter, meaning vital\nstrength: see Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. xv, p. 217. The Maruts are frequently\ncompared to birds (cf. I, 87, 2; 88, I), but it is usual to indicate the\ncomparison by na or iva. I therefore take vayas as a nom. sing. neut., in the\nsense of vigour, life. They are called b _ri_ hadvayasa _h_ in a Nivid; see\nLudwig, p. 226. Nir-i is used with particular reference to the birth of a\nchild (cf. V, 78, 7; 9).\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nWilson: They are the generators of speech: they spread out the waters in their\ncourses: they urge the lowing (cattle) to enter (the water), up to their\nknees, (to drink.)\n\nBenfey: In ihrem Lauf erheben dann diese Sohne Getos und Fluth, die bis zum\nKnie den Kuhen geht.\n\nLudwig: Und dise sone, die sanger, denten auf ihren zugen ihre banen aus, so\ndass brullend sie uns ganz nahe kamen.\n\nNote 1. If we could take sunava _h_ gira _h_ in the sense of the sons of\nvoice, i. e. of thunder, which would remove many difficulties, the accent of\ngira _h_ would have to be changed. The commentator takes sunu in the sense of\nutpadaka, producers of sound. Gira _h_ , however, occurs at least once more,\nin the sense of singers or poets, IX, 63, 10, where gira _h_ can only be a\nvocative, O ye singers! In I, 6, 6, the translation of gira _h_ by singers, i.\ne. the Maruts, may be contested, but if we consider that gira _h_ , in the\nsense of\n\np. 77\n\nhymns, is feminine, and is followed by the very word which is here used, viz.\ndevayanta _h_ , as a feminine, viz. devayanti _h_ , VII, 18, 3, we can hardly\ndoubt that in I, 6, 6, gira _h_ is a masculine and means singers. The same\napplies to VI, 63, 10. In VI, 52, 9, upa na _h_ sunava _h_ gira _h_ _s_ _ri_\n_n_ vantu am _r i_tasya ye, the construction is, of course, quite different.\n\nNote 2. The expression that the Maruts enlarged or extended the fences of\ntheir race-course (RV. IV, 58, 7), can only mean that they swept over the\nwhole sky, and drove the clouds away from all the corners. Ka\xc2\xb4sh _th_ a may\nmean the wooden enclosures (carceres) or the wooden poles that served as\nturning and winning-posts (metae). The Sama-Veda has ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ eshu instead\nof a _g_ meshu. That the translation of this verse is purely tentative, and\nfar from satisfactory, was known to all Vedic scholars, but I doubt whether\nthey will consider the interpretation which M. Bergaigne proposes with so much\nassurance, as less tentative and more satisfactory. He translates (Journ. As.\n1884, p. 239), des fils ont, dans leur marche, allonge leurs chants comme des\nchemins, pour y marcher a genoux (sur les genoux) en mugissant (en chantant).'\nI shall content myself with shortly pointing out the misgivings which every\nVedic scholar would feel at once in proposing such a rendering. First as to\nthe conception itself. Can a poet say, 'The Maruts have stretched out their\nsongs in order to march on them on their knees?' 'The roads,' as M. Bergaigne\nshows himself, are only a simile, and no one walks on a simile. Secondly, the\nidea that these Maruts widened the roads on which they march, is common\nenough, but that they lengthened their songs, like paths, is never said by the\nVedic _Ri_ shis, nor would they in such a case have left out the particle na\nor iva. Lastly, though many things are said of the Maruts, I do not remember\nthat they ever appear on their knees. I do not think, therefore, that M.\nBergaigne's infallible method helps us much beyond where we were before.\nConjectures are easy, but for that very reason, one does not like to bring\nthem forward. One might propose to read sunava _h_ diva _h_ , a very common\nname of the Maruts. One might go a step further, identify\n\np. 78\n\ngi _h_ with bharati, and point out that the Maruts are called the sons of\nBharata, II, 36, 2. But all this leaves us in utter uncertainty, and where a\nscholar feels the ground so uncertain beneath his feet, he hesitates to speak\nwith papal authority. M. Bergaigne's strong point is that abhi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ u means\non their knees, not up to their knees. Here again, I ask, does abhi in\nprepositional compounds ever mean on? If abhi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ u is used in the same\nsense in which we use 'on our knees,' it would in Sanskrit mean only 'bowing\nup to the knees.' Now in I, 72, 5, abhi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ u seems to express a positive\nexpression of reverence. With regard to the other passages where abhi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\nu occurs, M. Bergaigne has not shown how they ought to be translated so as to\ngive a clear sense. I do not pretend to solve the difficulties, but I think it\nis better to confess our difficulties than to hide them under the veil of a\nso-called systematic interpretation. Abhi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ u, like mita _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ u, may\nhave expressed a position of the knees, expressive of strength, but on such\npoints very little information is to be gained from Indian commentators.\n\nThe last sentence expresses the result of this race, viz. the falling of so\nmuch rain that the cows had to walk up to their knees in water. This becomes\nstill clearer from the next verse.\n\nSaya _n_ a: These, the producers of speech, have spread water in their\ncourses, they cause the cows to walk up to their knees hi order to drink the\nwater.\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nWilson: They drive before them, in their course, the long, vast, uninjurable,\nrain-retaining cloud.\n\nBenfey: Dann treiben sie im Sturm heran jenen langen and breiten Spross der\nWolke unerschopflichen.\n\nLudwig: Sogar disen langen, breiten, das kind der wolke, den unfeindlichen,\nschleudern auf ihren Zugen sie vorwarts.\n\nNote 1. Rain is called the offspring of the cloud, miho napat, and is then\ntreated as a masculine; cf. apam napat, &c.\n\np. 79\n\n##### Verse 12.\n\nWilson: Maruts, as you have vigour, invigorate mankind: give animation to the\nclouds.\n\nBenfey: O Marut's! mit der Kraft, die ihr besitzt, werft ihr Geschopfe um, die\nBerge werft ihr um sogar.\n\nLudwig: O Marut, so wie eure kraft ist, warft ihr die leute nieder, warft ihr\ndie berge nieder.\n\nNote 1. In VIII, 72, 8, a _k_ u _k_ yavit is explained by vyadarayat, he tore\nopen. A _k_ u _k_ yavitana is the Vedic form of the 2nd pers. plur. of the\nreduplicated aorist.\n\n##### Verse 13.\n\nWilson: Wherever the Maruts pass, they fill the way with clamour: every one\nhears their (noise).\n\nBenfey: Wenn die Marut's des Weges ziehn, dann sprechen mit einander sie und\nmancher mag sie horen.\n\nLudwig: Wenn die Marut wandern, sprechen auf dem weg sie mit einander, es\nhoret sie ein jeder.\n\nNote 1. Yanti has to be pronounced as an amphibrachys.\n\n##### Verse 14.\n\nWilson: Come quickly, with your swift (vehicles). The offerings of the Ka _n_\nvas are prepared. Be pleased with them.\n\nBenfey: Auf schnellen kommet schnell herbei, bei Ka _n_ va's Spross sind Feste\neuch: da wollt euch schon ergotzen.\n\nLudwig: Brecht rasch auf mit raschen rossen, bei den Ka _n_ va's ist euer\ndienst, dort eben erfreuet euch.\n\nNote 1. Benfey supposes that duva _h_ stands in the singular instead of the\nplural. But why should the plural have been used, as the singular (asti) would\nhave created no kind of difficulty? It is better to take duva _h_ as a\nnominative plural of a noun du, worshipper, derived from the same root which\nyielded duva _h_ , worship. We certainly find a-duva _h_ , as a nom. plur., in\nthe sense of not-worshipping:\n\np. 80\n\nVII, 4, 6. ma\xc2\xb4 tva vayam sahasa-van avi\xc2\xb4ra _h_ ma\xc2\xb4 apsava _h_ pari sadama ma\xc2\xb4\naduva _h_.\n\nMay we not, O hero, sit round thee like men without strength, without beauty\n(cf. VIII, 7, 7), without worship.\n\nHere Saya _n_ a explains aduva _h_ very well by pari _k_ ara _n_ ahina _h_ ,\nwhich seems better than Roth's explanation 'zogernd, ohne Eifer.'\n\n##### Verse 15.\n\nWilson: The offering is prepared for your gratification: we are your\n(worshippers), that we may live all our life.\n\nBenfey: Gerustet ist fur euren Rausch und wir gehoren, traun! euch an fur\nunser ganzes Lebelang.\n\nLudwig: Er ist euch zur trunkesfreude, und wir gleichfalls euer hier, dass\nunsere ganze dauer wir erleben.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[67:a](sbe3218.htm#fr_102) See Bugge, K.
