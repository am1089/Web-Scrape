ADHY\xc3\x82YA 1, VARGA 31.\n\n1\\. O Agni _G_ atavedas, accept graciously our offering, the sacrificial cake\nat the morning libation, O god who givest wealth for our prayers.\n\n2\\. The sacrificial cake, O Agni, has been baked or made ready for thee:\naccept it graciously, O youngest (god).\n\n3\\. Agni, accept eagerly the sacrificial cake which has been offered, which\nhas stood overnight. Thou art the son of strength, established at the\nsacrifice.\n\n4\\. At the midday libation, _G_ atavedas, accept here graciously the\nsacrificial cake, O sage. Agni, the wise ones do not diminish at the\nsacrificial distributions [1](sbe46088.htm#an_3:28:4:1) the portion which\nbelongs to thee, the vigorous one [2](sbe46088.htm#an_3:28:4:2).\n\n5\\. Agni, at the third libation take joyfully the sacrificial cake, O son of\nstrength, which has been offered. And in thy admirable way place our wakeful\nsacrifice, blessed with treasures, before the immortal gods.\n\n6\\. Agni, grown strong, O _G_ atavedas, accept graciously our offering, the\nsacrificial cake which has stood overnight.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi. The metre is Gayatri in verses 1, 2, 6, Ush _n_ ih in verse\n3, Trish _t_ ubh in verse 4, and _G_ agati in verse 5.--No verse occurs in the\nother Sa _m_ hitas.\n\np. 301\n\nThis Sukta and the following are, as their position at the end of the Anuvaka\nand the number of their verses show, later additions to the original\ncollection. The 28th hymn contains verses destined for the offerings of\nsacrificial cakes to Agni at each of the three Savanas. Quite in the same way\nhymn 52, which also belongs to the later additions, refers to sacrificial\ncakes offered to Indra. The oblation of such cakes to Indra at each Savana is\nfound also in the later Vedic ritual (comp. Katyayana IX, 9, 2 seq.; Weber,\nIndische Studien, X, 369, 376), and several verses of III, 52 are indicated\nthere as Puronuvakya verses for those very offerings; see \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana _S_\nrautasutra V, 4, 2. 3. After each cake-offering to Indra follows the Svish _t_\nak _ri_ t-oblation to Agni: and for these oblations \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana (loc. cit.\nSutra 6) prescribes verses 1, 4, and 5 of our hymn, according to the order of\nthe three Savanas. From the text of the hymn it seems to be evident that\nverses 1-3 have been composed for the first, verse 4 for the second, and\nverses 5-6 for the third Savana. With this distribution the change of the\nmetres evidently stands in connection. In accordance with the theories of the\nlater Vedic theologians, we have here the Gayatri as the characteristic metre\nof the first, the Trish _t_ ubh of the second, the _G_ agati of the third\nSavana.\n\nComp. also \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana VI, 5, 25, and the very ingenious but at the same\ntime somewhat hazardous observations of Bergaigne, Recherches sur l'Histoire\nde la Liturgie Vedique, 16 seq.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. The text has vidatheshu.\n\nNote 2. Comp. I, 36, 1, note 2.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 29](sbe46089.htm)\n\n"
