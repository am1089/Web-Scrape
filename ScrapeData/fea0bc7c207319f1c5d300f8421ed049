THE KRISHNA AVAT\xc4\x80RA.\n\nProfessor Goldstucker says * that this "is the most interesting incarnation of\nVishnu, both on account of the opportunity which it affords to trace in Hindu\nantiquity the gradual transformation of mortal heroes into representatives of\na god; and on account of the numerous legends connected with it, as well as\nthe influence which it exercised on the Vaishnava cult. In the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata,\nKrishna--which literally means \'the black or dark one\'\n\np. 198\n\n--is sometimes represented as rendering homage to Siva, and therefore\nacknowledging his own inferiority to that deity, or as recommending the\nworship of lima, the consort of Siva, and as receiving boons from both these\ndeities. In some passages, again, he bears merely the\n\n[![THE KRISHNA AVAT\xc4\x80RA.](tn/19800.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/19800.jpg)  \nTHE KRISHNA AVAT\xc4\x80RA.  \n\ncharacter of a hero endowed with extraordinary powers, and in others his\ndivine nature is even disputed or denied by adversaries, though they are\neventually punished for this unbelief. As the intimate ally of Arjuna, he\nclaims the rank of the supreme deity; but\n\np. 199\n\nthere are other passages, again, in the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata in which the same claim of\nSiva is admitted, and an attempt is made at compromising their rival claims,\nby declaring both deities one and the same. Sometimes, moreover, Krishna is in\nthis Epos declared to represent merely a very small portion--\'a portion of a\nportion,\' as it is called--of the divine essence of Vishnu. In the\nMah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata, therefore, which is silent also; regarding many adventures in\nKrishna\'s life fully detailed in the Pur\xc4\x81nas, the worship of Vishnu in this\nincarnation was by no means so generally admitted or settled as it is in many\nPur\xc4\x81nas of the Vaishnait sect; nor was there at that period that consistency\nin the conception of a Krishna Avat\xc4\x81ra, which is traceable in the later\nworks."\n\nIn the "Prem S\xc4\x81gar," the Hindi version of the "Bh\xc4\x81gavata Pur\xc4\x81na," is the\nfollowing account of the object of this incarnation. A king of Mathura, named\nUgrasena, had a beautiful wife, who was barren. One day, when walking in a\nwood, she lost her companions; and when alone, a demon becoming enamoured of\nher assumed her husband\'s form, and as a result a son was born, who was named\nKansa. When a mere child Kansa manifested a most cruel disposition--his great\ndelight being to catch and kill children--and he grew up to be a source of\nsorrow to his father, family, and country. He advised his father to give up\nthe worship of R\xc4\x81ma, the god of his race; and to call in secret only on\nMah\xc4\x81deva (Siva). His father replied with sorrow: "R\xc4\x81ma is my lord, and the\ndispeller of my grief; if I do not worship him, how shall I as a sinful man\ncross over the sea of the world?" Kanza hearing this, dethroned his father,\nand having usurped his place issued a proclamation throughout his dominions\nforbidding men to worship R\xc4\x81ma, and commanding them to reverence Siva;\n\np. 200\n\nand his tyranny at length became so unbearable, that the Earth, assuming the\nform of a cow, went to Indra and, complaining of all this, said: "Evil spirits\nhave begun to commit great crimes in the world; in dread of whom Religion and\nJustice have departed; and if you will permit me, I, too, will abandon the\nworld, and descend into the lower regions." Indra hearing this went in company\nwith the other gods to Brahm\xc4\x81 to see what redress could be afforded. Brahm\xc4\x81\nconducted them to Siva, who, in his turn, conducted them to Vishnu; and\nreminding him of the deliverance he had afforded to gods and men in his\nprevious manifestations, they induce him again to become a man for the\ndestruction of Kansa. The gods and goddesses, delighted at this assurance of\nhelp, promise also to forsake their heavenly homes that they may be his\ncompanions during his earthly sojourn; and Vishnu himself arranges that\nLakshman, who in the R\xc4\x81ma incarnation had been his brother and constant and\nfaithful companion, and Bharata also and Sutraghna, should accompany him; and\nthat Sit\xc4\x81, under the name of Rukmini, should be his wife.\n\nThe "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na," * from which most of the following legends are taken,\ngives a somewhat different account of Vishnu\'s reply. Krishna was the\nincarnation of "a part of a part of the supreme being." When entreated to\nbecome incarnate, "the supreme lord plucked off two hairs, one white and one\nblack, and said to the gods, \'These my hairs shall descend upon the earth, and\nshall relieve her of the burden of her distress!\'" The white hair was\nimpersonated as Balar\xc4\x81ma, and the black as Krishna. "The asuras shall all be\ndestroyed. This my black hair shall be impersonated in the eighth\n\np. 201\n\nconception of Devaki, the wife of Vasudeva, who is like a goddess, and shall\nslay Kansa, who is the demon K\xc4\x81lanemi." *\n\nWhen Vasudeva and his wife Devaki were being driven by King Kansa in a\nchariot, "a voice in the sky, sounding loud and deep like thunder, addressing\nKansa, said, \'Fool that you are, the eighth child of the damsel you are now\ndriving shall take away your life!\'" Kansa hearing this drew his sword, and\nwas about to slay Devaki; but Vasudeva interposed, saying, "Kill not Devaki,\ngreat warrior! Spare her life, and I will deliver to you every child she may\nbring forth." Kansa, appeased with this promise, spared the lady, but, to\nprevent any mistake, placed a guard by day and night over their apartments;\nand as child after child was born, it was given up to him and slain.\n\nKansa was under the impression that he had destroyed Devaki\'s children, but\nthis was not the case. The children that were handed over to him were children\nof Hiranyakasipu, whom Vishnu slew as the Man-Lion, who were brought from the\nnether regions by Yoganindra, "the great illusory energy of Vishnu," and\nlodged in Devaki\'s womb in order that the cruel Kansa might be overreached.\nVishnu said to this goddess: "Go, Nidra (Sleep), to the nether regions, and by\nmy command conduct successively six of their princes to be conceived by\nDevaki. When these shall have been put to death by Kansa, the seventh\nconception shall be formed of a portion of Sesha (the serpent-deity), who is\npart of me; and this\n\np. 202\n\nyou shall transfer before the time of birth to Rohini, another wife of\nVasudeva, who resides at Gokula." This child was Balar\xc4\x81ma. "The report shall\nrun that Devaki miscarries. I will myself become incarnate in her eighth\nconception; and you shall take a similar character as the embryo offspring of\nYasoda, the wife of a herdsman named Nanda. In the night of the eighth of the\ndark half of the month Nabhas I shall be born; and you will be born on the\nninth. Impelled and aided by my power, Vasudeva shall bear me to the bed of\nYasod\xc4\x81, and you to the bed of Devaki. Kansa shall take you and hold you up to\ndash you against a stone; but you shall escape into the sky, where Indra shall\nmeet and do homage to you through reverence of me."\n\nWhen Devaki gives birth to her eighth son, Vasudeva takes the child, and,\neluding the vigilance of the guards, hurries through the city, with the\nserpent Sesha following. On reaching the river Yamuna, which he has to cross,\nthough ordinarily both wide and deep, it assists him in his flight, the water\nonly rising to his knees. Just as he reaches Nanda\'s house, Yasod\xc4\x81 had given\nbirth to her child, which Vasudeva seizes, and, leaving Devaki\'s child in its\nplace, returns to his prison home, and manages to re-enter unobserved. Soon\nafter this the cry of the new-born child being heard by the guard, Kansa is\nquickly informed of its birth, and, rushing into the room, seized and dashed\nit against a stone. But fate was too strong for him. Immediately the child\ntouched the ground, "it rose into the sky, and, expanding into a gigantic\nfigure, having eight arms, each wielding some formidable weapon, laughed and\nsaid to Kansa, \'What avails it thee to have hurled me to the ground? He is\nborn that shall kill thee, the mighty one amongst the\n\np. 203\n\ngods, who was formerly thy destroyer.\'" The reference of the last sentence as\ntaught by other Pur\xc4\x81nas is to the fact that Kansa was no other than K\xc4\x81lanemi,\nwhom Vishnu had slain when incarnate as R\xc4\x81ma.\n\nGreatly alarmed by the unexpected frustration of his plans, Kansa collects his\nfriends, and, addressing them, said: "The vile and contemptible denizens of\nheaven are assiduously plotting against my life; they dreading my prowess, I\nhold them of no account. Have I not seen the king of the gods, when he had\nventured into the conflict, receiving my shafts upon his back, and not bravely\nupon his breast? Now, it is my determination to inflict still deeper\ndegradation upon these evil-minded and unprincipled gods. Let therefore every\nman who is notorious for liberality (in gifts to gods and Br\xc4\x81hmans), every man\nwho is remarkable for his celebration of sacrifices, be put to death; that\nthus the gods shall be deprived of the means by which they subsist. The\ngoddess who has been born as the infant child of Devaki has announced to me\nthat he is again alive who in a former being was .my death. Let therefore\nactive search be made for whatever young children there may be upon earth, and\nlet every boy in whom there are signs of unusual vigour be slain without\nremorse." Soon after this, as he feared nothing more from them, he released\nVasudeva and Devaki from their confinement, and, in dread of meeting his great\nenemy, withdrew into the inner apartments of his house.\n\nOn regaining his liberty, Vasudeva speedily sought out Nanda, who of course\nwas unaware of the change of children effected by Vasudeva, and, after\ncongratulating him on the birth of a son, suggested the advisability of his\nreturning home; as, having paid his taxes, there was nothing to detain him in\nthe city. He feared\n\np. 204\n\nlest the spies of Kansa should notice the peculiar excellences of the child,\nand destroy him according to Kansa\'s order. At the same time he took his other\nchild by Rohini (Balar\xc4\x81ma), and placed him under the care of Nanda to be\nbrought up as his own child. By this means, as R\xc4\x81ma and Lakshman were\ninseparable companions in the previous incarnation, Krishna and Balar\xc4\x81ma were\nas intimately connected in this.\n\nThe herdsman Nanda and his family had not been long settled at Gokula before\nefforts were made to destroy the infant Krishna. A female fiend named Putan\xc4\x81,\nthe sucking of whose breast was instant death to an infant, came by night,\nand, taking the child in her arms, offered him her breast. Krishna seized it\nwith both hands, and sucked with such violence that the hideous being roared\nwith pain, and giving way in every joint fell down dead. The villagers hearing\nthe shrieks rushed into the house to see what was the matter. Yasod\xc4\x81 waved a\ncow\'s tail brush over him, whilst Nanda put dried cow-dung upon his head, and,\nplacing an amulet on his arm, besought Vishnu to protect the child.\n\nThere are many legends connected with his boyhood, which teach his\nextraordinary power. On one occasion, when a mere infant, lying under Nanda\'s\nwagon, he cried for the breast, and, being impatient because his mother did\nnot come quickly, kicked the wagon over, to the great astonishment of the\nbystanders. He and Balar\xc4\x81ma played with and tormented the calves to such an\nextent, that Yasod\xc4\x81 became angry; and to prevent its repetition, tied Krishna\nto a heavy wooden mortar in which corn is threshed, and went on with her work.\nKrishna, trying to free himself from this, dragged it until it became wedged\nfast between two\n\np. 205\n\nArjuna trees, and with a strong pull the trees were uprooted. The people,\nastonished because the trees fell when no storm was blowing, thought the place\nmust be unlucky, and moved away to Vrind\xc4\x81vana. The Bh\xc4\x81gavata\n\n[![KRISHNA SLAYING BAK\xc4\x80SURA.](tn/20500.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/20500.jpg)  \nKRISHNA SLAYING BAK\xc4\x80SURA.  \n\nsays that these trees were two sons of Kuvera, the god of riches, who, owing\nto a curse of the sage N\xc4\x81rada, were thus metamorphosed, and that it was for\nthe purpose of liberating them that Krishna accomplished this feat.\n\np. 206\n\n[paragraph continues] Krishna and Balar\xc4\x81ma, the guardians of the world, were\nkeepers of cattle in the cowpens of Vrind\xc4\x81vana," until they were seven years\nof age, during which years, according to the "Bh\xc4\x81gavata Pur\xc4\x81na," the boys were\nfull of childish tricks: stealing butter from the neighbouring cowherds\nappears to have been their favourite pastime.\n\nIn the "Bh\xc4\x81gavata Pur\xc4\x81na" there are legends also of attempts being made by\nKansa to rid himself of his dreaded foe. One day a demon was sent who hoped to\nsurprise him when wandering with the cattle in the woods; but the boy, seeing\nthrough his disguise, seized him by the foot, swung him round his head and\ndashed him so violently on the ground that he immediately died. The next day,\nanother demon, assuming the form of an immense crane, seized Krishna with its\nbill; but he became so hot that the crane immediately released him: Krishna\nthen crushed its beak under his foot. Yet another came as a great serpent, and\nswallowed Krishna and his companions, the cowherds, with their cows; but he\nwas no sooner in the reptile\'s stomach than he expanded himself, and burst\nopen his prison. Krishna was not always defending himself; often he benefited\nhis companions. When Brahm\xc4\x81 stole some calves, and carried off the boys who\ntended them, Krishna made other calves and other boys, so that the theft was\nnever known by the cowherds.\n\nWe now return to the narrative of the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na." The river Yamuna was\nthe home of the serpent Kaliya, who made its waters boil with the fires of\npassion, so that the trees on its banks were blighted by its fumes, and birds\nwere killed by its heat. Krishna, seeing how his friends at Vrind\xc4\x81vana were\ninconvenienced by this, plunged into the stream, to the dismay of the\ncowherds, and, after challenging the serpent to fight, was\n\np. 207\n\nabout to slay him. Moved, however, by the intercession of the lady serpents,\nhe allowed him to live on condition that he and his family forsook the Yamuna,\nand took up their abode in, the sea.\n\nOn one occasion Krishna wished to annoy Indra. Seeing the Gopas (cowherds)\npreparing to worship the giver of rain, he dissuaded them from it, and urged\nthem rather to worship the mountain that supplied their cattle with food, and\ntheir cattle that yielded them milk. Acting upon this advice, they presented\nto the mountain Govarddhana "curds, milk, and flesh." This was merely a device\nby which Krishna diverted the worship of Indra to himself; for "upon the\nsummit of the mountain Krishna appeared, saying, \'I am the mountain,\' and\npartook of much food presented by the Gopas; whilst in his own form as Krishna\nhe ascended the hill along with the cowherds, and worshipped his other self."\nHaving promised them many blessings, the mountain-person of Krishna vanished.\nIndra, greatly incensed at the disregard shown him by Nanda and others, sent\nfloods to destroy them and their cattle; but Krishna, raising the mountain\nGovarddhana aloft on one hand, held it as an umbrella and thus sheltered his\nfriends from the storm for seven days and nights. Indra then visited Krishna\nand praised him for what he had done; and his wife Indr\xc4\x81ni entreated Krishna\nto be a friend of their son Arjuna.\n\nKrishna did not by any means confine his attention to the wants of the\ncowherds amongst whom he spent his early days. On one occasion Satrajit, a\nworshipper of the Sun, who had received from his lord a magnificent jewel\nnamed Syamantaka, came to visit Krishna at Dwaraka, adorned with his jewel,\nwhich shone so brightly that the inhabitants thought the Sun himself\n\np. 208\n\nwas present. It was a most marvellous gem, for its possessor received through\nit "eight loads of gold daily, and was free from all fear of portents, wild\nbeasts, fire,\n\n[![KRISHNA HOLDING UP MOUNT GOVARDDHANA.](tn/20800.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/20800.jpg)  \nKRISHNA HOLDING UP MOUNT GOVARDDHANA.  \n\nrobbers, and famine;" but there was this strange condition attached to its\npossession: "although it was an inexhaustible source of good to a virtuous\nperson, when\n\np. 209\n\nworn by a man of bad character it was the cause of his death." Thinking it\npossible that Krishna, on learning the excellence of the gem, might wish to\nkeep it, Satrajit gave it to his brother Prasena. When this brother was\nhunting, having taken the gem with him, he was killed by a lion. Jambavat, the\nking of the bears, seeing the gem in the lion\'s mouth, killed him and took\npossession of the jewel. When Prasena did not return as he was expected, the\nYadavas (Krishna\'s tribesmen) began to think that Krishna had slain him. To\nconvince them of his innocency, taking a number of his brethren, he traced the\nhorse upon which Prasena rode to the place where the lion slew its rider, and\nwas acquitted of all blame in the matter. He then followed Jambavat to his\ncave, and finding the bear-prince Sukum\xc4\x81ra playing with the gem, he entered\nand fought with his father the king for twenty-one days. As no tidings of him\nreached his home at Dwaraka, his friends concluded that he must be dead; but\nthe food and water offered in the performance of his funeral ceremonies\nsupporting him during his lengthened conflict, enabled him to overcome\nJambavat, who gave him his daughter Jambavati to wife. He returned home in\ntriumph, carrying the gem with him, which he restored to Satrajit, and\nreceived from him his daughter Satyabh\xc4\x81ma. This gem, after causing several\nother disputes, was finally given to a good king, Akrura. When it was offered\nto Krishna he confessed that as he had 16,000 wives it was not possible for\nhim to retain it; and also that his wife Satyabh\xc4\x81ma would not comply with the\nconditions imposed upon its possessor.\n\nThe Gopis (wives of the cowherds) are represented as being madly in love with\nKrishna. As he and Balar\xc4\x81ma played the flute, they came to dance with them;\nbut as\n\np. 210\n\nall could not hold Krishna\'s hand as they danced, he multiplied himself into\nas many forms as there were women, each woman believing she held the hand of\nthe true Krishna. * On one occasion he watched the Gopis as they went to bathe\nin the Yamuna river, and, stealing their clothes, sat in a tree and refused to\nrestore them until each came in the form of a suppliant with uplifted hands to\nfetch them. The Bh\xc4\x81gavata teaches that these women, impelled though they were\nby passion to seek Krishna, obtained through him final emancipation from sin.\n"In whatever way a man may worship him he will obtain deliverance. Some knew\nand sought him as a son, some as a friend, some as an enemy, some as a lover,\nbut in the end all obtained the blessing of deliverance and emancipation."\n\nOf all these women Krishna\'s favourite was R\xc4\x81dh\xc4\x81, the wife of \xc4\x80yanagosha. Her\nsister-in-law told her brother of his wife\'s misconduct, and R\xc4\x81dh\xc4\x81 was in fear\nlest he should murder her. When, however, she communicated her fears to her\nlover, he easily reassured her. He told her that when her husband came, he\n(Krishna) would transform himself into K\xc4\x81li, and instead of finding her with a\nlover, he would see her engaged in worshipping a goddess. Her husband\nhappening to pass that way soon after, noticed R\xc4\x81dh\xc4\x81 bowing down, and joined\nin worshipping Krishna, whom he mistook for K\xc4\x81li. It is R\xc4\x81dh\xc4\x81 whose name is\never associated with Krishna in hymns, songs, prayers, and pictures, and\nwhilst the wives of the deity are forgotten, R\xc4\x81dh\xc4\x81 is worshipped along with\nher lover.\n\nAs Krishna was dancing on one occasion with these women, a demon named\nArishta, in the form of a fierce\n\np. 211\n\nbull, savagely attacked him. Krishna quietly waited its approach, and, seizing\nhim as an alligator would have done, held him by the horns whilst he pressed\nhis sides with his knees; he then wrung his neck as if it had been a piece of\nwet cloth, and at last tearing off his horns beat him to death with them.\n\nAfter some years Kansa is informed of Krishna\'s\n\n[![R\xc4\x80DH\xc4\x80 WORSHIPPING KRISHNA AS K\xc4\x80LI.](tn/21100.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/21100.jpg)  \nR\xc4\x80DH\xc4\x80 WORSHIPPING KRISHNA AS K\xc4\x80LI.  \n\nexistence, and, as we have noticed above, sent various demons to slay him; but\nas these efforts failed, the king determined on a grand scheme by which he\nhoped to rid himself of his dreaded foe. He accordingly sent Akrura, one of\nthe few good men in his kingdom, with a most polite invitation to Krishna and\nBalar\xc4\x81ma to visit him\n\np. 212\n\nat his capital, to witness some athletic sports; and, in the hope that they,\nbeing off their guard, would fall an easy prey, ordered a demon named Kesin,\nin the form of a horse, to attack them on the road. But Krishna is more than a\nmatch for the fiend; he meets the horse and fearlessly thrusts his hand in its\nmouth, and, causing it to swell, bursts the animal into two parts: hence one\nof Krishna\'s many names is Kesava, the slayer of Kesin.\n\nAkrura, having told Krishna of the ill-feeling of Kansa and of the plots he\nhad made against his life, was greatly encouraged with the assurance that in\nthree days Kansa and his adherents would be slain. He took leave of the guests\nwhen they approached the city of Mathura. Entering the city unattended, and\ndressed as poor country people, they meet a washerman of Kansa at work, whom\nthey first annoy by throwing his clothes on the ground, and, when he\nexpostulates with them, kill him, and robe themselves in Kansa\'s garments.\nSeeing the gaily-dressed, strong, and good-looking young men, a flower-seller\npresents them with some of his choicest flowers; for his generosity Krishna\nbestows rich blessings upon him in this life and promises heaven after death.\nAfter this they meet a deformed girl named Kubja, carrying ointments and\nperfumes to the palace, some of which, at his request, she gives to Krishna.\nFor her kindness her deformity is cured, she is made beautiful, and invites\nthe brothers to her home.\n\nThe day following was fixed for the sports. The lists were prepared, the\ntrumpets sounded, and two fierce wrestlers were commanded by fair means or\nfoul to slay Krishna and his brother; and in case they should fail to do this,\nan enormous elephant was in readiness to trample them to death. But wrestlers\nand elephant\n\np. 213\n\nwere themselves slain. Seeing his grand scheme signally fail, the king lost\nhis temper and called out loudly to his guards to slay the youths-; instead of\nthis, however, Krishna rushed upon and slew the king in the midst of the\nassembly, and falling at the feet of his father and mother, Vasudeva and\nDevaki, placed Ugrasena, Kansa\'s father, upon the throne, and with his brother\ntook up his abode at Mathura.\n\nKrishna is of immense service to the people of Mathura, for very soon after\nhis arrival there, Jar\xc4\x81sandha, Kansa\'s father-in-law, attacks them, and is\nbeaten eighteen times by his prowess. When the people were almost exhausted\nwith these protracted struggles, a new enemy appears in Kalay\xc4\x81vana, King of\nthe Y\xc4\x81vanas, who wish to try their strength with the Y\xc4\x81davas under Krishna.\nHe, thinking that by a struggle with two foes at once the people would be\nexhausted, provided a new city, so strong that women could protect it, to\nwhich he conducted the inhabitants of Mathura. No sooner had he made the\npeople secure than he went forth unarmed and alone, and attracted the\nattention of the King of the Y\xc4\x81vanas, whose army still surrounded the city.\nKrishna, seeing the king was following him, entered a cave, and concealed\nhimself; the king seeing a man lying at its entrance, thinking it must be\nKrishna, kicked it, and in an instant became a heap of ashes. The secret of\nhis destruction was this: a man named Muchukunda had received as a boon from\nthe gods the power to sleep for a long period, with this condition, that\nwhoever awoke him should be instantly consumed by fire emanating from his\nbody. Unwittingly the King of the Y\xc4\x81vanas kicked him and received the penalty\nof his ignorance; whilst Krishna escaped, and seized the army and treasures\nleft without an owner.\n\np. 214\n\nAmongst many others, Krishna fell in love with Rukmini, the daughter of\nBhismaka, King of Vidhabha (Berar); but her brother Rukmin hated him, and\nrefusing to give his consent, at the advice of Jar\xc4\x81sandha, she was betrothed\nto Sisup\xc4\x81la. This Sisup\xc4\x81la was no other than Hiranyakasipu and R\xc4\x81vana, whom in\nprevious incarnations Vishnu had slain. On the eve of the wedding Krishna\ncarries off Rukmini, leaving Balar\xc4\x81ma and his friends to take care of\nthemselves; and when Rukmin follows him with an immense army, Krishna easily\ndestroys his companions, and, but for the intercession of Rukmini, would have\nkilled his brother-in-law too. This Rukmini was none other than Lakshmi, Sit\xc4\x81\nand others, who, in her earlier incarnations, had stood in a similar\nrelationship to him.\n\nSoon after this occurrence, Indra pays a visit to Krishna, to enlist his\nsympathy and help against Naraka, King of Pragyotisha, who was inflicting all\nkinds of evil upon the whole creation. "Carrying off maidens belonging to\ngods, saints, demons and kings, he shuts them up in his own palace. He has\ntaken away Varuna\'s umbrella, the celestial nectar-dropping earrings of my\nmother Aditi, and now demands my elephant." Krishna at once consents to help,\nmarches off to meet the king, conquers his forces, slays Naraka and obtains\nthe stolen property, for which on its restoration he receives the thanks of\nits owners. In the women\'s apartment he finds 16,100 damsels, and "at an\nauspicious moment received the hands of all, according to the ritual, in\nseparate houses; 16,100 was the number of the maidens, and into so many forms\ndid the foe of Madhu multiply himself; so that each of the damsels thought he\nhad wedded her in his single person, and he abode severally in the dwelling-\nplace of each of his wives. It\n\np. 215\n\nwas as a present from Um\xc4\x81, the wife of Siva, that he received these wives."\n\nThere was once a severe conflict between Krishna and Siva. Aniruddha, a\ngrandson of Krishna, was enamoured of Usha, a daughter of B\xc4\x81na, a devout\nworshipper of Siva, whom he visited secretly. Being caught by B\xc4\x81na\'s guard,\nthe prince was imprisoned, and, as the king would not release him, Krishna\nattacked him; but Siva and his son Kartikeya fought for B\xc4\x81na. After a severe\nencounter, as Siva sat weary in his car, and Kartikeya had fled from the\nfield, Krishna, tired of using ordinary weapons, let fly his wonderful discus,\nwhich never failed of accomplishing his wish, and cut off the hundred arms of\nB\xc4\x81na. When about to throw it a second time, Siva came and interceded for the\nlife of his friend; to whom, in granting his request, Krishna said, "You are\nfit to apprehend that you are not distinct from me; that which I am, thou\nart."\n\nAs Krishna was marching towards Sonitapura, the city in which his grandson was\nconfined, as narrated above, a strange enemy met him. "Fever, an emanation\nfrom Maheshwara (Siva), having three feet and three heads, fought desperately\nwith Krishna in defence of B\xc4\x81na. Baladeva (Balar\xc4\x81ma), upon whom his ashes were\nscattered, was seized with burning heat, and his eyelids trembled; but he\nobtained relief by clinging to the body of Krishna. Contending thus with the\ndivine holder of the bow, the Fever emanating from Siva was quickly expelled\nfrom the body of Krishna by Fever which he himself engendered. Brahm\xc4\x81,\nbeholding the impersonated malady, bewildered by the beating inflicted by the\narms of the deity, entreated the latter to desist, and the foe of Madhu\nrefrained, and absorbed into himself the Fever he had created. The rival Fever\nthen\n\np. 216\n\ndeparted, saying to Krishna, "Those who call to memory the combat between us\nshall be exempt from febrile diseases."\n\nKrishna was not without a rival. A man named Paundraka professed that he was\nthe true incarnation of Vishnu, and that V\xc4\x81sudeva (son of Vasudeva) was a\npretender. The King of Benares was induced to believe in this false Krishna,\nand at his request sent an order for the real Krishna to come and do him\nhomage, and at the same time to bring with him his discus and other insignia\nof office. Krishna did not hesitate. Setting off next day, he destroyed the\narmy of his rival in a moment, and addressing Paundraka himself said, "You\ndesired me by your envoy to resign to you my insignia: I now deliver them to\nyou. Here is my discus, here my mace, here is Garuda; let him mount upon thy\nstandard." The discus did its work, the rival of Krishna was cut to pieces;\nbut, as the R\xc4\x81ja of Benares continued to fight, his head was cut off, and fell\nin the city. The people in their distress cried to Siva, who, in answer, sent\na fierce female form to their help. But the discus, obedient to Krishna\'s\ncommand, pursued her, and its radiancy, unfortunately, was such that i t\nconsumed the whole city in which she had hid herself.\n\nWhen Krishna had finished his work, and had destroyed demons and wicked men,\nespecially Kansa, the time came for him to return to heaven; but, before his\ndeparture, owing to a curse pronounced by angry Br\xc4\x81hmans, it was necessary\nthat the Y\xc4\x81dava race from which he sprang should pass away. This curse was\npronounced to avenge an insult offered by some Y\xc4\x81du boys to N\xc4\x81rada and other\nRishis when engaged with their devotions. These boys, as a joke, dressed up a\nson of\n\np. 217\n\n[paragraph continues] Krishna, named S\xc4\x81mba, in woman\'s clothes, and taking him\nto the Rishis asked, "What child will this female give birth to?" The Rishis,\ngreatly annoyed, said, "She will bring forth a club which shall crush the\nwhole Y\xc4\x81dava race." Accordingly a club came from S\xc4\x81mba\'s body, which King\nUgrasena ordered to be ground to powder and thrown into the sea. The dust that\nfell on the shore became rushes, but a small part of the club, like a lance\nhead, could not be broken: this was thrown into the sea, was swallowed by a\nfish, which was caught by a fisherman, and made into an arrow point by a\nhuntsman named Jara.\n\nA messenger from the gods now visited Krishna, telling him that, as his work\nwas done, he should ascend to his home. This he was quite willing to do; but,\nwishing to save his race from the threatened destruction, advised the Y\xc4\x81davas\nto forsake their city and go to Prabh\xc4\x81sa. By his advice he unintentionally\nhastened their end; for on reaching the seashore they indulged in liquor and\nbegan to fight violently amongst themselves, and for arms seized the rushes\nwhich sprang from the dust of the fatal club that came from S\xc4\x81mba. Krishna and\nBalar\xc4\x81ma trying to make peace between the combatants only led to their swifter\ndestruction, until at last the two brothers were left alone of their race.\nWhilst sitting and talking on the banks of a river, a serpent crawled out of\nBalar\xc4\x81ma\'s mouth--the serpent Sesha, of which he was an incarnation, and so\nhis end was come. Krishna, left alone, sat meditating, with his foot upon his\nknee, when the hunter Jara, armed with the fatal arrow, passed by, and taking\nKrishna for a deer, shot him, and thus his death was unwittingly caused by the\nlast part of the cursed club. Jara, seeing his mistake, fell at Krishna\'s feet\nand asked\n\np. 218\n\nforgiveness, to whom Krishna said, "Fear not thou in the least. Go, hunter,\nthrough my favour to heaven, the abode of the gods." Immediately a celestial\ncar appeared, in which the man ascended to heaven; and Krishna abandoned his\nmortal body.\n\nIn this account of Krishna we have followed the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na," with which\nthe Bh\xc4\x81gavata agrees; though the latter has many additional legends, similar\nto those given above. The writers of these Pur\xc4\x81nas have no doubt regarding his\ndivinity; in fact a large part of these books is occupied with praises and\nprayers addressed to him as supreme. In the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata, however, Krishna is\nlittle more than a hero, excepting in those passages which are believed to be\nof much later origin than the body of the book. By the writers of that age\nKrishna is described as a worshipper of Siva, from whom he received the chief\nblessings he enjoyed.\n\nAmongst the references to Krishna in the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata are the following:\n*--"Krishna then reverenced Siva with voice, mind, understanding, and act;"\n_i.e._ when he accompanied Arjuna to Siva\'s abode to beg heavenly weapons.\nSiva replies, "I have been duly worshipped by Krishna, wherefore no one is\nclearer to me than Krishna." In a hymn Krishna thus praises Siva: "I know\nMah\xc4\x81deva, and his various works of old. For he is the beginning, middle, and\nend of (all) creatures." Bhisma says, "Through his devotion to Rudra, the\nworld is pervaded by the mighty Krishna. This M\xc4\x81dhava performed austerities\nfor a full thousand years, propitiating Siva, the god who bestows boons." It\nwas through propitiating Siva that Krishna had a son by Jambavati; from him he\nreceived the discus Sudarsana,\n\np. 219\n\nand from him he received eight boons, to which Um\xc4\x81 added eight others: among\nthe eight granted by Siva were "a hundred hundreds of sons," and by Um\xc4\x81\nsixteen thousand one hundred wives. According to Krishna, Siva "is the most\nexcellent of beings in the three worlds." "As he is the greatest of gods, he\nis called Mah\xc4\x81deva, since he constantly prospers all men in all their acts:\nseeking their welfare (Siva), he is called Siva."\n\nThe following legend will show that the belief in Krishna\'s divinity was not\nby any means common at the time the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata was written. When King\nYudhishthira offered a sacrifice, it was proposed that Krishna, as the\ngreatest chief present, should receive the presents that were made. Sisup\xc4\x81la\nstrongly objected to this, and supported his objection by a recital of\nKrishna\'s misdeeds. Krishna listened patiently for a time, but at last\ndeclared that the time had come when he must slay his detractor. He said, "I\nhave promised to forgive him a hundred offences--he has now offended more than\na hundred times;" and then the never-failing discus did its work. In other\npassages of the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata, Siva praises Krishna in almost as extravagant\nlanguage as that employed by Krishna to him; but this is so thoroughly opposed\nto his general position throughout the poem, there can be little doubt that\nthese passages were introduced when the worship of Krishna had to a large\nextent superseded that of Siva.\n\nKrishna, as described in the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata, was not above employing deception,\nand leading others to do it too. On one occasion during the great war between\nthe Kurus and P\xc4\x81ndavas, the P\xc4\x81ndavas were in great distress, owing to the\nbravery and skill of a Kuru chief named\n\np. 220\n\nDron\xc4\x81ch\xc4\x81rjya. This chief had a son whom he deeply loved, named Ashwatthama;\nand it was thought that if a report could be spread to the effect that this\nson was slain, his father would be too distressed to fight. Dron\xc4\x81ch\xc4\x81rjya at\nlast heard the rumour, but refused to believe it unless\n[Yudhishthira](errata.htm#0) confirmed it. At first the good king refused to\nspeak an untruth; but at Krishna\'s suggestion he repeated the words,\n"Ashwatthama is dead," meaning an elephant of that name, yet wishing the\nfather to understand he referred to his son. The trick succeeded; but the king\nas a punishment for his prevarication had to endure the sight of the lost in\nhell, whilst being conducted to heaven.\n\nAmongst Krishna\'s many names the following are the most common:--\n\nGopal, "The Cowherd."\n\nGopinath, "The Lord of the Milkmaids."\n\nMathuran\xc4\x81th, "The Lord of Mathura."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[197:*](hmvp26.htm#fr_209) Chambers\'s Cyclopaedia, _s.v._\n\n[200:*](hmvp26.htm#fr_210) Book v.\n\n[201:*](hmvp26.htm#fr_211) It should be noticed here that a commentator says\non this passage that the statement that two hairs of Vishnu became incarnate\nmust not be taken literally, but that the work to be done by him on this\noccasion was so small that it could easily have been effected by two hairs. In\nKrishna, Vishnu himself was manifested.\n\n[210:*](hmvp26.htm#fr_212) It is this incident in Krishna\'s history which is\ncelebrated yearly at the R\xc4\x81sajattra.\n\n[218:*](hmvp26.htm#fr_213) Muir, O.
