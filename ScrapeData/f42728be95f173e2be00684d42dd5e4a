 \nMy brother, yea my foe, comes nigh  \nAud dares me forth with shout and cry.  \nLearn, trembler! that the valiant, they  \nWho yield no step in battle fray,  \nWill die a thousand deaths but ne'er  \nAn unavenged dishonour bear.  \nNor, O my love, be thou dismayed  \nThough Rama lend Sugriva aid,  \nFor one so pure and duteous, one  \nWho loves the right, all sin will shun,  \nRelease me from thy soft embrace,  \nAnd with thy dames thy steps retrace:  \nEnough already, O mine own,  \nOf love and sweet devotion shown.  \nDrive all thy fear and doubt away;  \nI seek Sugriva in the fray  \nHis boisterous rage and pride to still,  \nAnd tame the foe I would not kill.  \nMy fury, armed with brandished trees,  \nShall strike Sugriva to his knees:  \n\np. 343  \n\nNor shall the humbled foe withstand  \nThe blows of my avenging hand,  \nWhen, nerved by rage and pride, I beat  \nThe traitor down beneath my feet.  \nThou, love, hast lent thine own sweet aid,  \nAnd all thy tender care displayed;  \nNow by my life, by these who yearn  \nTo serve thee well, I pray thee turn.  \nBut for a while, dear dame, I go  \nTo come triumphant o'er the foe.'  \n   Thus Bah spake in gentlest tone:  \nSoft arms about his neck were thrown;  \nThen round her lord the lady went  \nWith sad steps slow and reverent.  \nShe stood in solemn guise to bless  \nWith prayers for safety and success,  \nThen with her train her chamber sought  \nBy grief and racking fear distraught.  \n   With serpent's pantings fierce and fast  \nKing Bali from the city passed.  \nHis glance, as each quick breath he drew,  \nAround to find the foe he threw,  \nAnd saw where fierce Sugriva showed  \nHis form with golden hues that glowed,  \nAnd, as a fire resplendent, stayed  \nTo meet his foe in arms arrayed.  \nWhen Bali, long-armed chieftain, found  \nSugriva stationed on the ground,  \nImpelled by warlike rage he braced  \nHis warrior garb about his waist,  \nAnd with his mighty arm raised high  \nRushed at Sugriva with a cry.  \nBut when Sugriva, fierce and bold,  \nSaw Bali with his chain of gold.  \nHis arm he heaved, his hand he closed,  \nAnd face to face his foe opposed.  \nTo him whose eyes with fury shone,  \nIn charge imtpetuous rushing on,  \nSkilled in each warlike art and plan,  \nBali with hasty words began:  \n'My ponderous hood, to fight addressed.  \nWith fingers clenched and arm compressed.  \nShall on thy death doomed brow descend  \nAnd, crashing down, thy life shall end.'  \nHe spoke; and wild with rage and pride,  \nThe fierce Sagriva thus replied:  \n'Thus let my arm begin the strife  \nAnd from thy body crush the life.'  \n   Then Bali, wounded aud enraged,  \nWith furious blows the battle waged.  \nSugriva seemed, with blood-streams dyed,  \nA hill with fountains in his side.  \nBut with his native force unspent  \nA Sal tree from the earth he rent,  \nAnd like the bolt of Indra smote  \nOn Bali's head and chest and throat.  \nBruised by the blows he could not shield,  \nHalf vanquished Bali sank and reeled,  \nAs sinks a vessel with her freight  \nBorne down by overwhelming weight.  \n\nSwift as Suparna's  [1](ry291.htm#fn_583) swiftest flight  \nIn awful strength they rushed to fight:  \nSo might the sun and moon on high  \nEncountering battle in the sky.  \nFierce and more fierce, as fought the foes,  \nThe furious rage of combat rose.  \nThey warred with feet and arms and knees,  \nWith nails and stones and boughs and trees,  \nAnd blows descending fast as rain  \nDyed each dark form with crimson stain,  \nWhile like two thunder-clouds they met  \nWith battle-cry and shout and threat.  \nThen Rama saw Sugriva quail,  \nMarked his worn strength grow weak and fail.  \nSaw how he turned his wistful eye  \nTo every quarter of the sky.  \nHis friend's defeat he could not brook.  \nBent on his shaft an eager look,  \nThen burned to slay the conquering foe,  \nAnd laid his arrow on the bow.  \nAs to an orb the bow he drew  \nForth from the string the arrow flew  \nLike Fate's tremendous discus hurled  \nBy Yama  [2](ry291.htm#fn_584) forth to end the world.  \nSo loud the din that every bird  \nThe bow-string's clans with terror heard,  \nAnd wildly fled the affrighted deer  \nAs though the day of doom were near,  \nSo, deadly as the serpent's fang,  \nForth from the string the arrow sprang.  \nLike the red lightning's flash and flame  \nIt flew unerring to its aim,  \nAnd, hissing murder through the air,  \nPierced Bali's breast, and quivered there.  \nStruck by the shaft that flew so well  \nThe mighty Vanar reeled and fell,  \nAs earthward Indra's flag they pull  \nWhen As'vini's fair moon is full  [3](ry291.htm#fn_585)  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[342:1b](ry290.htm#fr_582) Tara means 'star'.
