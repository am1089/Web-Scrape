Of old, indeed, they were wont to seize this victim as one\ndedicated to Savit _ri_ , but now they seize it as one dedicated to Pra _g_\napati, saying, 'Savit _ri_ , in truth, is the same as Pra _g_ apati.' It is\ntherefore after having thrown together the (sacrificial) fires that they ought\nto perform this (animal) sacrifice on the G _ri_ hapati's own fires, thinking,\n'May we also have a share in this tail (of the. victim) wherewith they are now\nmaking offering together to the wives\n\np. 175\n\n[paragraph continues] (of the gods).' They then perform the initiation\nceremony whenever they choose.\n\n12:3:5:22\\. Here now they say, 'They ought to have separate hearths; and if\none of the initiates were to be taken ill let him stay aside offering the\nAgnihotra. If he gets well again, they bring (the fires) together and invite\nhim to join them; but if he dies they burn him by his own (three) fires 1\nwithout an (ordinary) fire for (burning) a dead body; and the other\nsacrificers sit (through the sacrificial session);--such at least is the\nperformance in the case of one who keeps up his sacrificial fires; but,\nindeed, they have their hearths in common: the theological explication of this\nis the same as in regard to the preparatory ceremonial 2.'\n\n12:3:5:33\\. They also say, 'Seeing that the performers of a year's session\nbecome initiated for a year, how does their Agnihotra come to be\nuninterrupted?' Let him reply, 'By the fast-milk.'\n\n12:3:5:44\\. They also say, 'Seeing that the performers of a year's session\nbecome initiated for a year, how does their Full-moon oblation come to be\nuninterrupted?' Let him reply, 'By the ghee and the sacrificial cake.'\n\n12:3:5:55\\. They also say, 'Seeing that the performers of a year's session\nbecome initiated for a year, how does their New-moon oblation come to be\nuninterrupted?' Let him reply, 'By the sour curds and the cake.'\n\np. 176\n\n12:3:5:66\\. They also say, 'Seeing that the performers of a year's session\nbecome initiated for a year, how does their offering to the Fathers come to be\nuninterrupted?' Let him reply,' By the Aupasana (rites 1).'\n\n12:3:5:77\\. They also say, 'Seeing that the performers of a year's session\nbecome initiated for a year, how does their offering of firstfruits come to be\nuninterrupted?' Let him reply, 'By Soma's pap 2.'\n\n12:3:5:88\\. They also say, 'Seeing that the performers of a year's session\nbecome initiated for a year, how do their seasonal offerings come to be\nuninterrupted?' Let him reply, 'By the Payasya 3.'\n\n12:3:5:99\\. They also say, 'Seeing that the performers of a year's session\nbecome initiated for a year, how does their animal sacrifice come to be\nuninterrupted?' Let him reply, 'By the animal and the cake 4.'\n\n12:3:5:1010\\. They also say, 'Seeing that the performers of a year's session\nbecome initiated for a year, how\n\np. 177\n\ndoes their Soma come to be uninterrupted?' Let him reply, 'By the Soma-\npressings.'\n\n12:3:5:1111\\. It is thus that these sacrificial rites enter into the year;\nand, verily, whosoever thus knows this entering of the sacrificial rites into\nthe year becomes a sharer in the heavenly world.\n\n12:3:5:1212\\. In the year there should be known to be uniformity:--one\nAtiratra they perform before, and one after, the Vishuvat; fifty three Agnish\n_t_ omas they perform before, and fifty-three after, the Vishuvat; one hundred\nand twenty Ukthya days they perform before, and one hundred and twenty after,\nthe Vishuvat,--thus at least in the case of those who perform the Svarasamans\nas Ukthyas.\n\n12:3:5:1313\\. And in the case of those who (perform them) as Agnish _t_ omas,\nthey perform fifty-six Agnish _t_ omas before, and fifty-six after, the\nVishuvat; one hundred and seventeen Ukthya days they perform before, and one\nhundred and seventeen after, the Vishuvat; six Sho _d_ a _s_ ins they perform\nbefore, and six after, the Vishuvat; thirty Sha _d_ ahas 1 they perform\nbefore, and thirty after, the Vishuvat:--such, then, is the uniformity of that\n(year), and, verily, he who thus knows this goes through a course of\nsacrificial performance which is uniform, and not ineffectual, neither\ndefective nor redundant.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[175:1](sbe44057.htm#fr_499) This is the regular procedure in accordance with\nG _ri_ hya rites, cf. \xc3\x82 _s_ v. G _ri_ hy. IV, 2, 11-13; whilst Paraskara, III,\n10, 11, merely says, 'with the domestic fire they burn him who has established\nhis (sacred) fire.'\n\n[175:2](sbe44057.htm#fr_500) For the 'pura _s_ _k_ ara _n_ a,' see part iv, p.\n337, note 2.\n\n[176:1](sbe44057.htm#fr_501) Viz., by those rites which, during the time for\nwhich the Sacrificer is initiated, may be performed on his domestic (\xc3\x82vasathya\nor Aupasana) fire. Cf. Katy. I, 1, 20. 21. Whether the domestic offerings to\nthe Fathers ( _s_ raddha) may be so performed seems doubtful.\n\n[176:2](sbe44057.htm#fr_502) For the ordinary performance of the \xc3\x82graya _n_\nesh _t_ i, see part i, p. 370 seqq. According to Katy. IV, 6, 11 seq. the\nperformance of a year's sattra is to mark the time at which the offering of\nfirst-fruits would otherwise have taken place by using new grain for his\nvrata-food, as well as for two Rauhi _n_ a cakes at the Upasads, and for the\ncakes offered in the animal sacrifice of the Soma days; and that a pap of new\n_s_ yamaka (millet) is to be offered to Soma at the proper season (during the\nrains, or autumn), and a pap of bamboo grain in summer.\n\n[176:3](sbe44057.htm#fr_503) For this dish, made by the addition of fresh\nboiled milk to sour curds, see part i, p. 381, note 2.\n\n[176:4](sbe44057.htm#fr_504) That is, by the animal offered on each successive\nSoma day, and the (savaniya) puro _d_ a _s_ as offered subsequently; cf. IV,\n2, 5, 14-22.\n\n[177:1](sbe44057.htm#fr_505) That is, counting the Praya _n_ iya Atiratra, _K_\naturvi _m_ _s_ a, Abhi _g_ it, and three Svarasamans as one six-days'\nperformance, before the Vishuvat; and the three Svarasamans, the Vi _s_ va _g_\nit, Gosh _t_ oma, \xc3\x82yush _t_ oma, four days of the Da _s_ aratra (preceding and\nsucceeding the central Sha _d_ aha), the Mahavrata, and Udayaniya Atiratra as\ntwo six-days' performances after the Vishuvat.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XII, 4, 1.
