Am I made of words? Am I merely a book with a covering of\nflesh and blood?\n\nThe earth is not a dead thing like the moon. She breathes. Her rivers and\noceans send up vapours in which she is clothed. She is covered with a mantle\nof her own dust which flies about the air. The onlooker, gazing upon the earth\nfrom the outside, can see only the light reflected from this vapour and this\ndust. The tracks of the mighty continents are not distinctly visible.\n\nThe man, who is alive as this earth is, is likewise always enveloped in the\nmist of the ideas which he is breathing out. His real land and water remain\nhidden, and he appears to be made of only lights and shadows.\n\nIt seems to me, in this story of my life, that, like a living plant, I am\ndisplaying the picture of an ideal world. But I am not merely what I want,\nwhat I think--I am also what I do not love, what I do not wish to be. My\ncreation had begun before I was born. I had no choice in regard to my\nsurroundings and so must make the best of such material as comes to my hand.\n\nMy theory of life makes me certain that the Great is cruel To be just is for\nordinary men--it is reserved for the great to be unjust. The surface of the\nearth was even. The volcano butted it with its fiery horn and found its own\neminence--its justice was not towards its obstacle, but towards itself.\nSuccessful injustice and genuine cruelty have been the only forces by which\nindividual or nation has become millionaire or monarch.\n\nThat is why I preach the great discipline of Injustice. I say to everyone:\nDeliverance is based upon injustice. Injustice is the fire which must keep on\nburning something in order to save itself from becoming ashes. Whenever an\nindividual or nation becomes incapable of perpetrating injustice it is swept\ninto the dust-bin of the world.\n\nAs yet this is only my idea--it is not completely myself. There are rifts in\nthe armour through which something peeps out which is extremely soft and\nsensitive. Because, as I say, the best part of myself was created before I\ncame to this stage of existence.\n\nFrom time to time I try my followers in their lesson of cruelty. One day we\nwent on a picnic. A goat was grazing by. I asked them: "Who is there among you\nthat can cut off a leg of that goat, alive, with this knife, and bring it to\nme?" While they all hesitated, I went myself and did it. One of them fainted\nat the sight. But when they saw me unmoved they took the dust of my feet,\nsaying that I was above all human weaknesses. That is to say, they saw that\nday the vaporous envelope which was my idea, but failed to perceive the inner\nme, which by a curious freak of fate has been created tender and merciful.\n\nIn the present chapter of my life, which is growing in interest every day\nround Bimala and Nikhil, there is also much that remains hidden underneath.\nThis malady of ideas which afflicts me is shaping my life within: nevertheless\na great part of my life remains outside its influence; and so there is set up\na discrepancy between my outward life and its inner design which I try my best\nto keep concealed even from myself; otherwise it may wreck not only my plans,\nbut my very life.\n\nLife is indefinite--a bundle of contradictions. We men, with our ideas, strive\nto give it a particular shape by melting it into a particular mould--into the\ndefiniteness of success. All the world-conquerors, from Alexander down to the\nAmerican millionaires, mould themselves into a sword or a mint, and thus find\nthat distinct image of themselves which is the source of their success.\n\nThe chief controversy between Nikhil and myself arises from this: that though\nI say "know thyself", and Nikhil also says "know thyself", his interpretation\nmakes this "knowing" tantamount to "not knowing".\n\n"Winning your kind of success," Nikhil once objected, "is success gained at\nthe cost of the soul: but the soul is greater than success."\n\nI simply said in answer: "Your words are too vague."\n\n"That I cannot help," Nikhil replied. "A machine is distinct enough, but not\nso life. If to gain distinctness you try to know life as a machine, then such\nmere distinctness cannot stand for truth. The soul is not as distinct as\nsuccess, and so you only lose your soul if you seek it in your success."\n\n"Where, then, is this wonderful soul?"\n\n"Where it knows itself in the infinite and transcends its success."\n\n"But how does all this apply to our work for the country?"\n\n"It is the same thing. Where our country makes itself the final object, it\ngains success at the cost of the soul. Where it recognizes the Greatest as\ngreater than all, there it may miss success, but gains its soul."\n\n"Is there any example of this in history?"\n\n"Man is so great that he can despise not only the success, but also the\nexample. Possibly example is lacking, just as there is no example of the\nflower in the seed. But there is the urgence of the flower in the seed all the\nsame."\n\nIt is not that I do not at all understand Nikhil\'s point of view; that is\nrather where my danger lies. I was born in India and the poison of its\nspirituality runs in my blood. However loudly I may proclaim the madness of\nwalking in the path of self-abnegation, I cannot avoid it altogether.\n\nThis is exactly how such curious anomalies happen nowadays in our country. We\nmust have our religion and also our nationalism; our _Bhagavadgita_ and also\nour _Bande Mataram_. The result is that both of them suffer. It is like\nperforming with an English military band, side by side with our Indian festive\npipes. I must make it the purpose of my life to put an end to this hideous\nconfusion.\n\nI want the western military style to prevail, not the Indian. We shall then\nnot be ashamed of the flag of our passion, which mother Nature has sent with\nus as our standard into the battlefield of life. Passion is beautiful and pure\n--pure as the lily that comes out of the slimy soil. It rises superior to its\ndefilement and needs no Pears\' soap to wash it clean.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V](hw18.htm)\n\n'
