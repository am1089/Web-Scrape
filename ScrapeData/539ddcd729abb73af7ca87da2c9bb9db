Here the teachers enumerate the following (regulations).\n\n3\\. Na _g_ atalomnyopahasam i _k_ _kh_ et.\n\n4\\. Nor (should he wish for sport) with a girl who is the only child of her\nmother,\n\n5\\. Nor with a woman during her courses,\n\n6\\. Nor with one who descends from the same _Ri_ shis.\n\n7\\. Let him not eat food which has been brought by another door (than the\nusual),\n\n8\\. Or which has been cooked twice,\n\n9\\. Or which has stood over night\xc2\x97\n\n10\\. Except such as is prepared of vegetables, flesh, barley, or flour.\n\np. 86\n\n11\\. Let him not run while it is raining.\n\n12\\. Let him not take himself his shoes in his hands (when putting them on or\npulling them off).\n\n13\\. Let him not look into a well.\n\n14\\. Let him not gather fruits himself.\n\n15\\. He should not wear a scentless wreath,\n\n16\\. If it is not a wreath of gold.\n\n17\\. (He should not wear a wreath) of which the expression mala (garland) has\nbeen used.\n\n18\\. He should cause the people to call it sra _g_ (wreath). (Then he may wear\nit.)\n\n19\\. He should avoid using the word bhadra ('blessed') without a reason.\n\n20. 20 He should say (instead of it), mandra ('lovely').\n\n21. 21 There are three (kinds of) Snatakas:\n\n22\\. A Vidyasnataka (or a Snataka by knowledge), a Vratasnataka (or a Snataka\nby the completion of his vow), and a Vidyavratasnataka (i.e. Snataka by both).\n\n23\\. Of these the last ranks foremost; the two others are equal (to each\nother).\n\n24\\. (A Snataka) should not put on a wet garment.\n\n25. 25 He should not wear one garment.\n\n26\\. He should not praise any person (excessively).\n\n27\\. He should not speak of what he has not seen, as if he had seen it,\n\np. 87\n\n28\\. Nor of what he has not heard, as if he had heard it.\n\n29\\. He should give up everything that forms an impediment for his Veda-\nrecitation.\n\n30\\. He should endeavour to keep himself (pure from every defilement) like a\npot of oil.\n\n31\\. He should not climb a tree.\n\n32\\. He should not go toward evening to another village,\n\n33. 33 Nor alone,\n\n34\\. Nor together with V _ri_ shalas (or _S_ udras).\n\n35\\. He should not enter the village by a by-path.\n\n36\\. And he should not walk without a companion.\n\n37\\. These are the. observances for those who have performed the Samavartana,\n\n38. 38 And what (besides) is prescribed by _S_ ish _t_ as.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[85:1](sbe30027.htm#fr_308) 5, 1 seq.

The\ncommentator of course tries to defend Gobhila, but I think he has not\nsucceeded. Probably Gobhila has taken the two Sutras from different texts on\nwhich his own composition seems to be based.\n\n[87:38](sbe30027.htm#fr_313) Baudhayana I, 1, 6 (S.B.E. XIV, 144): 'Those are\ncalled _S_ ish _t_ as who, in accordance with the sacred law, have studied the\nVeda together with its appendages, know how to draw inferences from that, and\nare able to adduce proofs perceptible by the senses from the revealed texts.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 6](sbe30028.htm)\n\n"
