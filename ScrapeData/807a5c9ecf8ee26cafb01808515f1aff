Since (the highest Brahman) is inside (of the limiting adjuncts), it\nparticipates in their increase and decrease; owing to the appropriateness\n(thus resulting) of the two (things compared) it is thus (i.e. the comparison\nholds good).\n\nThe parallel instance (of the sun's reflection in the water) is\nunobjectionable, since a common feature--with reference to which alone the\ncomparison is instituted--does exist.\n\np. 159\n\n[paragraph continues] Whenever two things are compared, they are so only with\nreference to some particular point they have in common. Entire equality of the\ntwo can never be demonstrated; indeed if it could be demonstrated there would\nbe an end of that particular relation which gives rise to the comparison. Nor\ndoes the sutrakara institute the comparison objected to on his own account; he\nmerely sets forth the purport of a comparison actually met with in scripture.\n--Now, the special feature on which the comparison rests is 'the participation\nin increase and decrease.' The reflected image of the sun dilates when the\nsurface of the water expands; it contracts when the water shrinks; it trembles\nwhen the water is agitated; it divides itself when the water is divided. It\nthus participates in all the attributes and conditions of the water; while the\nreal sun remains all the time the same.--Similarly Brahman, although in\nreality uniform and never changing, participates as it were in the attributes\nand states of the body and the other limiting adjuncts within which it abides;\nit grows with them as it were, decreases with them as it were, and so on. As\nthus the two things compared possess certain common features no objection can\nbe made to the comparison.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2, 21](sbe38124.htm)\n\n"
