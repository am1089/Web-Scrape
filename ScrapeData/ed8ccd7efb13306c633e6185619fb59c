A Brahma _n_ a's wife, seeing the Brahma _n_\na her husband, who had gone through all knowledge and experience 2, seated in\nseclusion, spoke to him (thus): 'What world, indeed, shall I go to, depending\non you as (my) husband, you who live renouncing (all) action, and who are\nharsh and undiscerning 3. We have heard that wives attain to the worlds\nacquired by (their) husbands. What goal, verily, shall I reach, having got you\nfor my husband?' Thus addressed, that man of a tranquil self, spoke to her\nwith a slight smile: 'O beautiful one! O sinless one! I am not offended at\nthese words of yours. Whatever action there is, that can be caught (by the\ntouch) 4, or seen, or heard, that only do the men of action engage in as.\naction. Those who are devoid of knowledge only lodge 5 delusion in themselves\nby means of action. And freedom from action\n\np. 257\n\nis not to be attained in this world even for an instant 1. From birth to the\ndestruction of the body, action, good or bad, by act, mind or speech 2, does\nexist among (all) beings. While the paths 3 (of action), in which the\nmaterials are visible, are destroyed by demons 4, I have perceived by means of\nthe self the seat abiding in the self 5\\--(the seat) where dwells the Brahman\nfree from the pairs of opposites, and the moon together with the fire 6,\nupholding (all) beings (as) the mover of the intellectual principle 7; (the\nseat) for which 8 Brahman and others concentrating (their minds) worship that\nindestructible (principle), and for which learned men have their senses\nrestrained, and their selfs tranquil, and (observe) good vows. It is not to be\nsmelt by the nose, and not to be tasted by the tongue. It is not to be touched\nby the sense of touch, but is to be apprehended by the mind. It cannot be\n\np. 258\n\nconquered by the eyes,, and is entirely beyond the senses of hearing. It is\ndevoid of smell, devoid of taste and touch, devoid of colour and sound, and\nimperishable 1. (It is that) from which (this whole) expanse 2 (of the\nuniverse) proceeds, and on which it rests. From this the Pra _n_ a, Apana,\nSamana, Vyana, and Udana also proceed, and into it they enter 3. Between the\nSamana and the Vyana, the Pra _n_ a and the Apana moved. When that 4 is\nasleep, the Samana and Vyana also are absorbed 5; and between the Pra _n_ a\nand the Apana dwells the Udana pervading (all). Therefore the Pra _n_ a and\nthe Apana do not forsake a sleeping person. That is called the Udana, as the\nlife-winds are controlled 6 (by it). And therefore those who study the Brahman\nengage in penance 7 of which I am the goal 8. In\n\np. 259\n\nthe interior 1, in the midst of all these (life-winds) which move about in the\nbody and swallow up one another 2, blazes the Vai _s_ vana fire 3 sevenfold.\nThe nose, and the tongue, and the eye, and the skin, and the ear as the fifth,\nthe mind and the understanding, these are the seven tongues 4 of the blaze of\nVai _s_ vanara. That which is to be smelt, that which is to be drunk, that\nwhich is to be seen, that which is to be touched, and likewise that which is\nto be heard, and also that which is to be thought of, and that which is to be\nunderstood, those are the seven (kinds of) fuel for me 5. That which smells,\nthat which cats, that which sees, that which touches, and that which hears. as\nthe fifth, that which thinks, and that which understands, these are the seven\ngreat officiating priests 6. And mark this always,\n\np. 260\n\n[paragraph continues] O beautiful one! The learned sacrificers throwing (in)\ndue (form) the seven offerings into the seven fires in seven ways, produce\nthem in their wombs 1; (namely), that which is to be smelt, that which is to\nbe drunk, that which is to be seen, that which is to be touched, and likewise\nthat which is to be heard, that which is to be thought of, and also that which\nis to be understood. Earth, air, space, water, and light as the fifth, mind\nand understanding, these seven, indeed, are named wombs. All the qualities\nwhich stand 2 as offerings are absorbed into the mouth of the fire 3; and\nhaving dwelt within that dwelling are born in their respective wombs 4. And in\nthat very (principle), which is the generator of all entities, they remain\nabsorbed during (the time of) deluge. From that 5 is produced smell; from that\nis produced taste; from that is produced colour; from that touch is produced;\nfrom that is produced sound; from that doubt 6 is produced; from that is\nproduced determination. This (is what) they know as the sevenfold production.\nIn this very way was it 7 comprehended by the ancients. Becoming perfected by\nthe perfect sacrifice 8, they were perfectly filled with light.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[256:1](sbe0832.htm#fr_1217) I. e. the questions at [p.\n252](sbe0831.htm#page_252), Nilaka _nth_ a; more probably, perhaps, the\n'doctrine' mentioned at [p. 254](sbe0831.htm#page_254) is what is alluded to.\n\n[256:2](sbe0832.htm#fr_1218) Cf. Gita, [p. 57](sbe0805.htm#page_57) and note.\n\n[256:3](sbe0832.htm#fr_1219) Nilaka _nth_ a says this means 'ignorance that\nthe wife has no other support.' Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra interprets kina _s_ a to\nmean 'indigent' instead of 'harsh.'\n\n[256:4](sbe0832.htm#fr_1220) So Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra. Nilakan _th_ a's reading\nand his interpretation of the passage are different.\n\n[256:5](sbe0832.htm#fr_1221) I follow Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra; the original\nliterally means 'restrain.'\n\n[257:1](sbe0832.htm#fr_1222) Cf. Gita, pp. [52](sbe0804.htm#page_52),\n[53](sbe0805.htm#page_53); see also, as to freedom from action, Gita, [p.\n127](sbe0820.htm#page_127).\n\n[257:2](sbe0832.htm#fr_1223) I. e. thought, word, and deed. I have in the text\nkept to a more literal rendering.\n\n[257:3](sbe0832.htm#fr_1224) This is Nilaka _nth_ a's reading and\ninterpretation. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra reads 'actions visible and invisible.'\n\n[257:4](sbe0832.htm#fr_1225) Cf. inter alia Kumara-sambhava II, 46.\n\n[257:5](sbe0832.htm#fr_1226) I. e. says Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, the safe place,\nwithin the body; and says Nilaka _nth_ a, the seat called Avimukta, between\nthe nose and the brows; as to which cf. Gita, [p. 67](sbe0807.htm#page_67). In\nthe Kenopanishad (p. 220) the word ayatana is used to signify a means to the\nattainment of the Brahman.\n\n[257:6](sbe0832.htm#fr_1227) The moon and fire constitute the universe, says\nAr _g_ una Mi _s_ ra. Cf. Gita, [p. 113](sbe0817.htm#page_113). Nilakan _th_ a\ninterprets this more mystically as referring to the I _d_ a and Pi _n_ gala\narteries.\n\n[257:7](sbe0832.htm#fr_1228) So Nilaka _nth_ a, but he takes it to stand for\n'vayu' or wind, as a distinct principle. The sense is by no means clear. But\nthe moon being the deity of the mind also may, perhaps, be described as she is\nhere, on that account.\n\n[257:8](sbe0832.htm#fr_1229) This is Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra's interpretation of\nthe original locative.\n\n[258:1](sbe0832.htm#fr_1230) Cf. note  [4](sbe0831.htm#fn_1159), [p.\n247](sbe0831.htm#page_247) supra, and [p. 253](sbe0831.htm#page_253).\n\n[258:2](sbe0832.htm#fr_1231) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says this means the five\ngreat elements, the eleven organs (active and perceptive, and the mind), the\nlife-wind, and the individual soul.\n\n[258:3](sbe0832.htm#fr_1232) The Pra _n_ a is at the nose, the Apana at the\narms, the Samana at the navel, the Vyana pervades the whole body, and the\nUdana is at all the joints; cf. Yoga-sutra III, 38 seq. Nilaka _nth_ a says\nthis explains how the 'expanse' (meaning, he says, the operations of the\ncreation, &c.) 'proceeds' from the Brahman. See on the life-winds, B _ri_\nhadara _ny_ aka, p. 667; _Kh_ andogya, pp. 42-188; Sa _n_ khyatattvakaumudi,\np. 96; Vedanta Paribhasha, p. 45; [p. 271](sbe0835.htm#page_271) infra.\n\n[258:4](sbe0832.htm#fr_1233) The self, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra. Nilaka _nth_ a\nsays, the Pra _n_ a accompanied by the Apana.'\n\n[258:5](sbe0832.htm#fr_1234) I. e. into the Pra _n_ a and Apana, Ar _g_ una Mi\n_s_ ra.\n\n[258:6](sbe0832.htm#fr_1235) Nilaka _nth_ a derives the word thus, utkarshe\n_n_ a anayati.\n\n[258:7](sbe0832.htm#fr_1236) I. e. the subjugation of the life-winds as\nindicated at Gita, [p. 61](sbe0806.htm#page_61).\n\n[258:8](sbe0832.htm#fr_1237) The meaning of the passage as a whole is not very\nclear, and the commentators afford but little help. The sense appears to be\nthis: The course of worldly life is due to the operations of the life-winds\nwhich are attached to the self and lead to its manifestations as individual\nsouls. Of these, the Samana and Vyana are p. 259 controlled and held under\ncheck by the Pra _n_ a and Apana, into which latter the former are absorbed in\nsleep. The latter two are held in check and controlled by the Udana, which\nthus controls all. And the control of this, which is the control of all the\nfive, and which is otherwise called penance, destroys the course of worldly\nlife, and leads to the supreme self.\n\n[259:1](sbe0832.htm#fr_1238) I. e. within the body.\n\n[259:2](sbe0832.htm#fr_1239) As explained in note  8, p. 258.\n\n[259:3](sbe0832.htm#fr_1240) This, says Nilaka _nth_ a, explains the word 'I'\nin the sentence preceding. Vaisvanara is a word often used to denote the self.\nThe Vishama _s_ loki derives it thus, 'that which saves all beings from hell;'\nsee the Prasna-upanishad, pp. 167-188 (where seven tongues are also referred\nto); Mu _nd_ aka, p. 292; _Kh_ andogya, p. 364; Mandukya, p. 341.\n\n[259:4](sbe0832.htm#fr_1241) Cf. Taittiriya-aranyaka, p. 802.\n\n[259:5](sbe0832.htm#fr_1242) I. e. the Vaisvanara. Cf. Taittiriya-aranyaka, p.\n803 and gloss.\n\n[259:6](sbe0832.htm#fr_1243) These I take to be the powers of hearing, &c.,\nwhich are presided over by the several deities; or, better, Perhaps, they may\nmean the soul distinguished as so many with reference to these several powers;\ncf. B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p. 169; Maitri, p,. 96; Prasna, pp. 214, 215;\nKaushitaki, p. 96; Aitareya, p. 187; _Kh_ andogya, p. 616. The latter sense is\naccepted by Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[260:1](sbe0832.htm#fr_1244) The next clause explains this; that which is to\nbe smelt is earth, and so on throughout. The men who sacrifice all sensuous\nobjects, get such powers that they can create the objects whenever they like.\nAs to 'in their wombs,' see Yoga Bhashya, p. 108.\n\n[260:2](sbe0832.htm#fr_1245) I. e. are so treated in the above allegory.\n\n[260:3](sbe0832.htm#fr_1246) I. e. the Brahman.\n\n[260:4](sbe0832.htm#fr_1247) I. e. when the sacrificer wishes, as stated in\nnote  1.\n\n[260:5](sbe0832.htm#fr_1248) That principle--viz. the Brahman.\n\n[260:6](sbe0832.htm#fr_1249) This is the operation of the mind, see Gita, [p.\n57](sbe0805.htm#page_57) note.\n\n[260:7](sbe0832.htm#fr_1250) The Brahman, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra. Or it may be\nthe 'sevenfold production.'\n\n[260:8](sbe0832.htm#fr_1251) The wholesale sacrifice of all sensuous\nperceptions. The p. 262 root corresponding with perfect occurs three times in\nthe original, hence the repetition of perfect above.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VI](sbe0833.htm)\n\n"
