Should it be said that it is not so, on account of the word, &c., and on\naccount of the abiding within; we say, no; on account of meditation being\ntaught thus, on account of impossibility; and because they read of him as\nperson.\n\nAn objection is raised. Vai _s_ vanara cannot be ascertained to be the highest\nSelf, because, on the account of the text and of the abiding within, we can\nunderstand by the Vai _s_ vanara in our text the intestinal fire also. The\ntext to which we refer occurs in the Vai _s_ vanara-vidya of the Va _g_\nasaneyins, 'This one is the Agni Vai _s_ vanara,' where the two words 'Agni'\nand 'Vai _s_ vanara' are exhibited in\n\np. 291\n\nco-ordination. And in the section under discussion the passage, 'the heart is\nthe Garhapatya fire, the mind the Anvaharya-pa _k_ ana fire, the mouth the\n\xc3\x82havaniya fire' ( _Kh_. Up. V, 18, 2), represents the Vai _s_ vanara in so far\nas abiding within the heart and so on as constituting the triad of sacred\nfires. Moreover the text, 'The first food which a man may take is in the place\nof Soma. And he who offers that first oblation should offer it to Pra _n_ a'\n(V, 19, 1), intimates that Vai _s_ vanara is the abode of the offering to Pra\n_n_ a. In the same way the Va _g_ asaneyins declare that Vai _s_ vanara abides\nwithin man, viz. in the passage 'He who knows this Agni Vai _s_ vanara shaped\nlike a man abiding within man.' As thus Vai _s_ vanara appears in co-\nordination with the word 'Agni,' is represented as the triad of sacred fires,\nis said to be the abode of the oblation to Breath, and to abide within man, he\nmust be viewed as the intestinal fire, and it is therefore not true that he\ncan be identified with the highest Self only.\n\nThis objection is set aside by the Sutra. It is not so 'on account of\nmeditation (on the highest Self) being taught thus,' i.e. as the text means to\nteach that the highest Brahman which, in the manner described before, has the\nthree worlds for its body should be meditated upon as qualified by the\nintestinal fire which (like other beings) constitutes Brahman's body. For the\nword 'Agni' denotes not only the intestinal fire, but also the highest Self in\nso far as qualified by the intestinal fire.--But how is this to be known?--'On\naccount of impossibility;' i.e. because it is impossible that the mere\nintestinal fire should have the three worlds for its body. The true state of\nthe case therefore is that the word Agni, which is understood to denote the\nintestinal fire, when appearing in co-ordination with the term Vai _s_ vanara\nrepresented as having the three worlds for his body, denotes (not the\nintestinal fire, but) the highest Self as qualified by that fire viewed as\nforming the body of the Self. Thus the Lord also says, 'As Vai _s_ vanara fire\nI abide in the body of living creatures and, being assisted by breath inspired\nand expired, digest the fourfold food' (Bha Gi. XIV, 15). 'As Vai _s_ vanara\nfire' here\n\np. 292\n\nmeans 'embodied in the intestinal fire.'--The _Kh_ andogya text under\ndiscussion enjoins meditation on the highest Self embodied in the Vai _s_\nvanara fire.--Moreover the Va _g_ asaneyins read of him, viz. the Vai _s_\nvanara, as man or person, viz. in the passage 'That Agni Vai _s_ vanara is the\nperson' (Sa. Bra. X, 6, 1, 11). The intestinal fire by itself cannot be called\na person; unconditioned personality belongs to the highest Self only. Compare\n'the thousand-headed person' ( _Ri_. Sa _m_ h.), and 'the Person is all this'\n( _S_ ve. Up. III, 15).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 28. For the same reasons not the divinity and the\nelement](sbe48094.htm)\n\n"
