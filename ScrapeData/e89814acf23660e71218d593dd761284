'On account of this not being stated by Scripture'; not so, on account of\nthose who perform sacrifices and so on being understood.\n\nBut, a further objection is raised, in the whole section under discussion no\nmention at all is made of the soul; the section cannot therefore prove that\nthe soul moves, enveloped by water. The text speaks only of different forms of\nwater _s_ raddha and the rest.--This, the Sutra points out, is not so, on\naccount of those who perform sacrifices being understood. For further on in\nthe same chapter it is said, that those who, while destitute of the knowledge\nof Brahman, practise sacrifices, useful works and alms, reach the heavenly\nworld and become there of the essence of the moon (somara _g_ ana _h_ );\nwhence, on the results of their good works being exhausted, they return again\nand enter on a new embryonic state ( _Kh_. Up. V, 10). Now in the preceding\nsection (V, 9) it is said that they offer _s_ raddha in the heavenly world,\nand that from that oblation there arises the king Soma--an account which\nclearly refers to the same process as the one described in V, 10. We herefrom\ninfer that what is meant in V, 9 is that that being which was distinguished by\na body of _s_ raddha, becomes a being distinguished by a body of the nature of\nthe moon. The word body denotes that the nature of which it is to be the\nattribute of a soul, and thus cxtends in its connotation up to the soul. The\nmeaning of the section therefore is that it is the soul which moves enveloped\nby water and the other rudimentary elements.--But the phrase 'him the gods\neat' (V, 10, 4) shows that the king Soma cannot be the soul, for that cannot\nbe eaten!--To this the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 7.
