Neither air nor function, on account of its being stated separately.\n\nIs this main vital breath nothing else but air, the second of the elements? Or\nis it a certain motion of the air? Or is it air that has assumed some special\ncondition?--The first alternative may be adopted, on account of the text 'pra\n_n_ a is air.'--Or, since mere air is not called breath, while this term is\ngenerally applied to that motion of air which consists in inhalation and\nexhalation, we may hold that breath is a motion of air.--Of both these views\nthe Sutra disposes by declaring 'not so, on account of separate statement.'\nFor in the passage 'From him there is produced breath,mind,and all sense-\norgans,ether and air,' &c, breath and air are mentioned as two separate\nthings. For the same reason breath also cannot be a mere motion or function of\nair; for the text does not mention any functions of fire and the other\nelements, side by side with these elements, as separate things (and this shows\nthat breath also cannot, in that text, be interpreted to denote a function of\nair). The text 'pra _n_ a is air,' on the other hand, intimates (not that\nbreath is identical with air. but) that breath is air having assumed a special\nform, not a thing altogether different from it, like fire. In ordinary\nlanguage, moreover, the word _breath_ does not mean a mere motion but a\nsubstance to which motion belongs; we say,'the breath moves to and fro in\ninhalation and exhalation.'\n\nIs breath, which we thus know to be a modification of air, to be considered as\na kind of elementary substance, like fire, earth, and so on? Not so, the next\nSutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 9. But like the eye and the rest...](sbe48307.htm)\n\n"
