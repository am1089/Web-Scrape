Now, _G_ anaka of Videha once met some Brahma _n_ as who were\ntravelling about 1, to wit, _S_ vetaketu \xc3\x82ru _n_ eya, Soma _s_ ushma Satyaya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ i, and Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya. He said to them, 'How do ye each of you\nperform the Agnihotra?'\n\n11:6:2:22\\. _S_ vetaketu \xc3\x82ru _n_ eya replied, 'O great king, I make offering,\nin one another, to two heats, never-failing and overflowing with glory.'--'How\nis that?' asked the king.--'Well, \xc3\x82ditya (the sun) is heat: to him I make\noffering in Agni in the evening; and Agni, indeed, is heat: to him I make\noffering in the morning in \xc3\x82ditya 2.'--'What becomes of him who offers in this\nway?' asked the\n\np. 113\n\nking.--'He verily becomes never-failing in prosperity and glory, and attains\nto 'the fellowship of those two deities, and to an abode in their world.'\n\n11:6:2:33\\. Then Soma _s_ ushma Satyaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ i said, 'I, O king, make\noffering to light in light.'--'How is that?' asked the king.--'Well, \xc3\x82ditya is\nlight: to him I make offering in Agni in the evening; and Agni, indeed, is\nlight: to him I make offering in \xc3\x82ditya in the morning.'--'What becomes of him\nwho offers in this way? He verily becomes lightsome, and glorious, and\nprosperous; and attains to the fellowship of those two deities, and to an\nabode in their world.'\n\n11:6:2:44\\. Then Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said, 'When I take out the fire (from the\nGarhapatya), it is the Agnihotra itself, I thereby raise 1 Now when \xc3\x82ditya\n(the sun) sets, all the gods follow him; and when they see that fire taken out\nby me, they turn back. Having then cleansed the (sacrificial) vessels, and\ndeposited them (on the Vedi), and having milked the Agnihotra cow, I gladden\nthem, when I see them, and when they see me.'--'Thou, O Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya,\nhast inquired most closely into the nature of the Agnihotra,' said the king;\n'I bestow a hundred cows on thee. But not even thou (knowest) either the\nuprising, or the progress, or the support, or the contentment, or the return,\nor the renascent world of those two (libations of the Agnihotra).' Thus\nsaying, he mounted his car and drove away.\n\n11:6:2:55\\. They said, 'Surely, this fellow of a Ra _g_ anya has outtalked us:\ncome, let us challenge him to\n\np. 114\n\na theological disputation!' Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said, 'We are Brahma _n_ as,\nand he is a Ra _g_ anya: if we were to vanquish him, whom should we say we had\nvanquished? But if he were to vanquish us, people would say of us that a Ra\n_g_ anya had vanquished Brahma _n_ as: do not think of this!' They approved of\nhis words. But Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, mounting his car, drove after (the king).\nHe overtook him, and he (the king) said, 'Is it to know the Agnihotra, Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ avalkya?'--'The Agnihotra, O king!' he replied.\n\n11:6:2:66\\. 'Well, those two libations, when offered, rise upwards: they enter\nthe air, and make the air their offering-fire, the wind their fuel, the sun-\nmotes their pure libation: they satiate the air, and rise upwards therefrom.\n\n11:6:2:77\\. 'They enter the sky, and make the sky their offering-fire, the sun\ntheir fuel, and the moon their pure libation: they satiate the sky, and return\nfrom there.\n\n11:6:2:88\\. 'They enter this (earth), and make this (earth) their offering-\nfire, the fire their fuel, and the herbs their pure libation: they satiate\nthis (earth), and rise upwards therefrom.\n\n11:6:2:99\\. 'They enter man, and make his mouth their offering-fire, his\ntongue their fuel, and food their pure libation: they satiate man; and,\nverily, for him who, knowing this, eats food the Agnihotra comes to be\noffered. They rise upwards from there.\n\n11:6:2:1010\\. 'They enter woman, and make her lap their offering-fire, her\nwomb the fuel,--for that (womb) is called the bearer, because by it Pra _g_\napati bore creatures,--and the seed their pure libation: they satiate woman;\nand, verily, for him who, knowing this, approaches his mate, the Agnihotra\ncomes to\n\np. 115\n\nbe offered. The son who is born therefrom is the renascent world: this is the\nAgnihotra, Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, there is nothing higher than this.' Thus he\nspoke; and Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya granted him a boon. He said, 'Let mine be the\n(privilege of) asking questions of thee when I list, Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya!'\nThenceforth _G_ anaka was a Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[112:1](sbe44035.htm#fr_352) Or, driving about (and officiating at\nsacrifices); see [XI, 4, 1, 1](sbe44021.htm#11:4:1:1).
