Vyasa said :-- On hearing Vi _sn_ u's words, the Devas became very glad\nand presented immediately their own weapons, ornaments and clothings. The K\n_s_ iroda (Milk) Ocean presented to Her gladly, the well fitted necklace,\nclear as crystal, and a pair of divine cloths, of a red colour, never becoming\nold and very fine. Vis'vakarma was very much gratified in his heart and\npresented a divine jewel to be worn in Her diadem or crest blazing like\nhundreds of suns; white earrings; bracelets for Her wrist, bracelets for Her\nupper arm, and other bracelets decked with various gems and jewels and anklets\nbrilliant like gems, of a clear Sun-like lustre, decked with jewels, and\ntinkling nicely. The architect of the gods, the ocean of intellect,\nVis\xc2\x92vakarma gave Her as offerings beautiful ornaments also for the neck, all\nvery beautiful, as well as for the fingers decked with gems and jewels, all\nshining splendidly. Varu _n_ a gave for Her head garland of lotuses, never\nfading away, of such a sweet fragrance as bees constantly hover round them and\nthe Vaijayanti garland for Her breast. The mountain Himalya gladly offered Her\nvarious gems and a beautiful lion, of a golden colour for Her conveyance. Then\nthat beautiful Lady, having all the auspicious signs, wishing welfare to all,\nand decorated with the divine ornaments began to look grand and splendid,\nmounted on Her conveyance, the Lion. Vi _sn_ u then created another thousand\nspoked discus (Chakram) from His own Chakra, capable to take off the head of\nany Asura, and offered it to Her. S\xc2\x92ankara created another excellent Tris'ula\nfrom his own Trident, terrible and demon-killing, and offered it to the Devi.\nVaru _n_ a created another bright conch from his own conch and offered it\ngladly to the Devi. Fire offered Her a weapon named S'ataghni which kills\nviolently the demons, as if that is another god of death. Maruta (wind), the\nchief of the gods, offered Her a wonderful bow and arrow case filled with\narrows. The bow can be drawn with great difficulty and emits a very harsh\nsound. Indra created another dreadful thunderbolt from his own thunderbolt and\ngave it at once to the Devi; as well the beautiful sonorous bell that used to\nhang from the elephant\n\n\n\np. 382\n\n\n\nAiravata. Yama, the God of Death, created another beautiful staff from his own\nsceptre which takes away when time comes, the life of all beings. Brahma\ngladly gave Her a divine Kamandalu, filled with the Ganges water; and Varu _n_\na offered Her a weapon called Pas'a. O King! Time gave Her an axe and a shield\nand Vis'vakarma gave Her a sharp Paras'u. Kuvera, the Lord of wealth, gave her\na golden drinking cup, filled with wine; and Varu _n_ a offered Her a divine\nbeautiful lotus. Vis'vakarma became very glad and gave Her the Kaumodaki gada,\ncapable to kill the enemy of the gods and whence hundreds of bells are\nhanging, an impenetrable armour and various other weapons. The Sun gave to the\nDivine Mother his own rays. The Devas, seeing Her adorned with ornaments and\nweapons, began to praise and chant hymns to that most Auspicious Goddess, the\nGreat Enchantress of the three worlds.\n\n\n\n23-29. The Deva said :-- \xc2\x93Salutation to S'iva, Salutation to the Most\nAuspicious; Thou art peace and nourishment; we salute again and again to Thee.\nSalutation to Thee, the Bhagavati Devi; Thou art the Goddess Rudrani (the\nterrible), we always salute again and again to Thee. Thou art the Kalaratri\n(the night of destruction at the end of the world); Thou art the Indrani. Thou\nart the Mother, we salute again and again to Thee; Thou art the success, Thou\nart the intelligence, Thou art the growth, Thou art the Vaisnavi; salutation\nagain and again to Thee. Thou art within the earth; yet the earth does know\nknow Thee. Thou art again the inmost of the earth and controllest the things\nwithin this earth; we offer our salutations to that Supreme Cause, the Highest\nGoddess. Thou art within this Maya (the unborn) yet the Maya does not know\nThee. Thou residest again within the innermost of the Maya and directest that\nUnborn One, the Maya, we salute again and again to that Supreme Cause, the\nGreat Directress, the S'iva (the most auspicious). O Mother! Do what is good\nto us; we are oppressed by our enemy, dost then protect us; by Thy own power\ndost Thou overpower and kill that Mahi _s_ a. That demon is vulnerable by\nwoman only, he is deceitful, cunning, dreadful, and swollen with pride on his\nhaving got the blessing; he assumes many forms and torments the Devas. O One,\ndevoted to the Bhaktas! Thou art the only refuge of all the gods; O Thou art\nthe supreme goddess, we are very much harassed and oppressed by the Danava;\ntherefore dost Thou now protect us; we bow down to Thee.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n30\\. Vyasa said :-- When the Devas had praised thus, the Highest Goddess, the\nGiver of all happiness, then smilingly said in the following auspicious terms\n:--\n\n\n\np. 383\n\n\n\n31\\. \xc2\x93O Devas! Today in the battle ground I will overpower that wicked Mahi\n_s_ a, of cruel disposition and take away his life.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n32-40. Vyasa said :-- Speaking thus in a melodious voice, the Supreme One\nsmiled and again said :-- \xc2\x93This world is all full of error and delusion.\nReally, it is very wonderful that Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, Indra and other gods are\nall shuddering out of fear from Mahi _s_ a Danava. The power of Destiny is\nexceedingly great and terrible; its influence cannot be overcome even by the\nbest of the Devas. O king! The Time is the Lord of happiness and pain; Time\nis, therefore, the God. The wonder is this that even those who can create,\npreserve and destroy this world, they are being overpowered and tormented by\nMahi _s_ a. The Devi, thinking thus, smiled; then laughed and laughed very\nhoarsely; it seemed that a roar of laughter then arose. And the Danavas were\nstruck with terror at that very dreadful sound. The earth trembled at that\nextraordinary sound; the mountains began to move and the vast oceans that\nremained calm began to be agitated with billows. The uproar filled all the\nquarters and the mountain Meru trembled. Then the Danavas, hearing the\ntumultuous uproar, were all filled with tremendous fear. The Devas became very\nglad and said thus :-- \xc2\x93O Devi! Let victory be Yours; save us.\xc2\x94 The\nintoxicated Mahi _s_ a, too, hearing those words, became very angry. Mahi _s_\na, struck with terror at those words, asked the Daityas \xc2\x93O Messengers! Go and\nascertain how has originated this sound.\n\n\n\n41-48. Who has made this harsh sound? Bring that devil who has made this\nhoarse noise, be he a Deva, Danava, or anyone else unto me and I will kill\nthat roaring villain, who, it seems, has been puffed with egoism and vanity.\nThe Devas are not making this noise, for they are vanquished and terror-\nstricken; The Asuras are not doing so, for they are my subjects; then, who is\nthe stupid fellow that has done so? Surely he is of very little understanding;\nhis days are numbered; and I will carry him to the home of Death. Go you,\nascertain the cause of sound and come back to me; then I will go there and\ndestroy that wretch who made this noise to no purpose.\xc2\x94 Vyasa said :-- No\nsooner the messengers heard these words of Mahi _s_ a, than they at once went\nto the Devi and saw that Her body and the several parts thereof were all very\nbeautiful; She had eighteen hands, She was decorated completely with various\nornaments all over Her body, all the auspicious signs were being seen in Her\nbody and that She was holding excellent divine weapons. That auspicious\nGoddess beautiful, was holding in Her hands, the cup and drinking wine again\nand again. Beholding Her this form, they were afraid and fled at once to the\nMahi _s_ a and informed him the cause of that sound.\n\n\n\np. 384\n\n\n\n49-54. The Daityas said :-- \xc2\x93O Lord! We have seen one grown up woman; whose\nwhereabouts we are quite ignorant. The Devi is decorated with jewels and\nornaments all over Her body; She is not human nor Asuri but Her form is\nextraordinary and beautiful. That noble Lady is mounted on a lion, holding\nweapons on all Her eighteen hands and is roaring loudly; She is drinking wine;\nso it seems that She is puffed up with liquor. It is quite certain that She\nhas no husband. The Devas are gladly chanting praises from the celestial space\nthat Let Victory be to Her side and that She save the Devas, O Lord! We don't\nknow at all who is that handsome woman? or whose wife is she; why has she come\nthere? and what is Her motive? Sentiments of love, heroism, laughter, terror\nand wonder are all fully shining in Her; therefore we are very much\noverpowered by the halo emitted from Her; and we could not even see Her well.\n\n\n\nNote :-- Rasas means sentiments. The rasas are usually eight. Sringara, Hasya,\nKaru _n_ a, Raudra, Vira, Bhayanakah, Bibhatsadbhu tasangau, Chetya _st_ au,\nNatyan, Rasah smritah but sometimes Santarasah, is added thus making the total\nnumber nine; sometimes a tenth, Vatsalyarasa is also added.\n\n\n\n55\\. O King! In compliance with your order, we have come back to you no sooner\nwe had seen the Lady, without even addressing Her in any way. Now order us\nwhat we are to do.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n56-58. Mahi _s_ a said :-- \xc2\x93O Best of ministers! O Hero! Under my command, go\nthere with all the forces and use the means, conciliation, etc., and bring\nthat woman, having a beautiful face (like the Moon), to me. If that Lady do\nnot come even when the three policies, Sama (conciliation), Dana (making\ngifts), and Bheda (sowing dissensions in an enemy's party and thus winning him\nover to one's side, one of the four Upayas or means of success against an\nenemy) are adopted by you, then apply the last resort Dan _d_ a, (or war) in\nsuch a way that Her life be not destroyed and bring that beautiful woman to\nme. I will gladly make Her, of black curling hairs, my queen-consort. In case\nthat deer-eyed one comes gladly, then do my desires without causing any\nunpleasant feeling; (a cessation of sentiment). I am enchanted on hearing\nabout Her beauties and wealth.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n59-67. Vyasa said :-- The prime minister, on hearing the words of Mahi _s_ a,\ntook with him elephants, horses, and chariots and hurriedly went to the\ndesired place. On coming near to the Devi, the minister began to address Her\nin sweet words from a sufficient distance in a very humble and courteous way.\nO Sweet speaking! Who art Thou? What has caused Thee to come here? O Highly\nfortunate! My master has asked through me these\n\n\n\np. 385\n\n\n\nquestions. My master cannot be killed by all the Devas and men; he has\nconquered all the Lokas (worlds). O Beautiful-eyed! On account of getting his\nboon from Brahma, the Lord of the Daityas has become very powerful and\nconsequently being very proud, assumes different forms at will. He, our King-\nEmperor Mahi _s_ a, the lord of the earth, hearing about Thy beauty and dress,\nhas expressed a desire to see Thee. O Beautiful one! Whether he will appear\nbefore Thee in a human form? He will do whatever Thou likest. O Deer-eyed One!\nBe pleased now to go to that intelligent King. In case Thou dost not go, we\nwill bring the King, Thy devotee, to Thee. O Lord of the Devas! Our King has\nheard of Thy beauty and grandeur and has become very much submissive to Thee.\nWe will therefore do exactly what Thou desirest. Therefore, Thou having thighs\nthick and round like those of a young of an elephant! Be pleased to express\nwhat Thou likest and we will do quickly as Thou\n\ndesirest.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Ninth Chapter of the Fifth Book on the worship offered by the\ngods to the Devi and the weapons offered by them in the Maha Pura _n_ am, S'ri\nMad Devi Bhagavatam, of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 10](bk05ch10.htm)\n\n"
