Or rather there is no (unity of the vidyas), owing to the difference of\nsubject-matter.\n\nSetting aside the view maintained by the purvapakshin, we have rather to say\nthat, owing to the difference "of subject-matter, the two vidyas are separate.\n--In the _Kh_ andogya the introductory sentence (I, 1, 1), \'Let a man meditate\non the syllable Om (as) the udgitha,\' represents as the object of meditation\nthe syllable Om which is a part of the udgitha; thereupon proceeds to give an\naccount of its qualities such as being the inmost essence of all (\'The full\naccount, however, of Om is this,\' &c.); and later on tells, with reference to\nthe same syllable Om which is a part of the udgitha, a story about the Gods\nand Asuras in which there occurs the statement,\' They meditated on the udgitha\n\np. 194\n\nas that breath 1.\' If now we should assume 2 that the term \'udgitha\' denotes\nhere the whole act of worship (not only the syllable Om which is a part of the\nudgitha), and that (in the passage, \'they meditated on the udgitha as that\nbreath\') the performer of that worship, i.e. the Udgat _ri_ -priest, is said\nto be meditated upon as breath; our interpretation would be open to two\nobjections: in the first place it would be opposed to the introductory\nsentence (which directly declares the syllable Om to be the object of\ndevotion); and in the second place it would oblige us to take the word udgitha\n(in \'they meditated on the udgitha\'), not in its direct sense, but as denoting\nby implication the udgat _ri_. But the rule is that in one and the same\nconnected passage the interpretation of later passages has to adapt itself to\nthe earlier passages. We therefore conclude the passage last quoted to teach\nthat the syllable Om which is a part of the udgitha is to be meditated upon as\npra _n_ a.--In the Va _g_ asaneyaka on the other hand there is no reason for\ntaking the word udgitha to denote a part of the udgitha only, and we therefore\nmust interpret it to denote the whole; and in the passage, \'Do thou sing out\nfor us,\' the performer of the worship, i.e. the Udgat _ri_ -priest, is\ndescribed as pra _n_ a. In reply to the purvapakshin\'s remark that in the Va\n_g_ asaneyaka also the udgitha and the pra _n_ a occur in co-ordination (in\nthe passage, \'He is udgitha\'), we point out that that statement merely aims at\nshowing that the Self of all is that pra _n_ a which the text wishes to\nrepresent as udgat _ri_. The statement, therefore, docs not imply the unity of\nthe two vidyas. Moreover, there also the term udgitha denotes the whole act of\nworship (while in the _Kh_ andogya it denotes the omkara only). Nor must it be\nsaid that the pra _n_ a can\n\np. 195\n\nimpossibly be an udgat _ri_ , and that on that account our interpretation of\nthe B _ri_ had-ara _n_ yaka passage is erroneous; for with a view to pious\nmeditation scripture may represent the pra _n_ a as udgat _ri_ as well as\nudgitha. And, moreover, the Udgat _ri_ actually performs his work by the\nstrength of his breath; hence the pra _n_ a may be called udgat _ri_. In\naccordance with this the text says (I, 3, 24). \'He sang it indeed as speech\nand breath.\'--And if we understand that the text clearly intends to convey a\ndifference of matter we have no right to conclude from merely apparent\nsimilarities of expression that only one matter is intended to be expressed.\nTo quote an analogous instance from the karma-ka _n_ _d_ a: In the section\nrelative to the unexpected rising of the moon during the dar _s_ a-sacrifice,\nas well as in the section about the offering to be made by him who is desirous\nof cattle, we meet with identical injunctions such as the following one, \'He\nis to divide, the grains into three portions, and to make those of medium size\ninto a cake offered on eight potsherds to Agni the Giver,\' &c.; nevertheless\nit follows from the difference of the introductory passages of the two\nsections that the offerings to be made on account of the moon\'s rising are\nindeed not connected with the divinities of the dar _s_ a-sacrifice (but do\nnot constitute a new sacrifice separate from the dar _s_ a), while the section\nabout him who is desirous of cattle enjoins a separate sacrificial performance\n1.--Analogously a difference in the nature of the introductory clauses effects\na difference of the vidyas, \'As in the case of that which is greater than\ngreat.\' That means: Just as the meditation on the udgitha enjoined in the\npassage, \'Ether is greater than these, ether is their rest; he is indeed the\nudgitha, greater than great, he is without end\' ( _Kh_. Up. I, 9, 1), and the\nother meditation on the udgitha as possessing the qualities of abiding within\nthe eye and the sun, &c. ( _Kh_. Up. I, 6), are separate meditations, although\nin both the udgitha is identified with the highest Self; so it is with vidyas\nin general. The special features of different vidyas are not to be combined\neven when the\n\np. 196\n\nvidyas belong to one and the same _S_ akha; much less then when they belong to\ndifferent _S_ akhas.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[194:1](sbe38150.htm#fr_129) From which it appears that the _Kh_ andogya\nenjoins throughout a meditation on the syllable Om which is only a part of the\nudgitha; while the object of meditation enjoined in the B _ri_ had-ara _n_\nyaka is the whole udgitha.\n\n[194:2](sbe38150.htm#fr_130) Viz. for the purpose of making out that the\nobject of meditation is the same in the _Kh_ andogya and the B _ri_ had-ara\n_n_ yaka.\n\n[195:1](sbe38150.htm#fr_131) Cp.
