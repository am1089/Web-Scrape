Then _S_ aivya Satyakama asked him:--'Sir, if some one among men should\nmeditate here until death on the syllable Om, what would he obtain by it?'\n\n2\\. He replied: 'O Satyakama, the syllable Om (AUM) is the highest and also\nthe other Brahman;\n\np. 282\n\ntherefore he who knows it arrives by the same means 1 at one of the two.\n\n3\\. If he meditate on one Matra (the A) 2, then, being enlightened by that\nonly, he arrives quickly at the earth 3. The _Ri_ _k_ -verses lead him to the\nworld of men, and being endowed there with penance, abstinence, and faith, he\nenjoys greatness.\n\n4\\. If he meditate with 4 two Matras (A + U) he arrives at the Manas 5, and is\nled up by the Ya _g_ us-verses to the sky, to the Soma-world. Having enjoyed\ngreatness in the Soma-world, he returns again.\n\n5\\. Again, he who meditates with this syllable AUM of three Matras, on the\nHighest Person, he comes to light and to the sun. And as a snake is freed from\nits skin, so is he freed from evil. He is led up by the Saman-verses to the\nBrahma-world 6; and from him, full of life (Hira _n_ yagarbha, the lord of the\nSatya-loka 7), he learns 8 to see the all-pervading, the Highest Person. And\nthere are these two _S_ lokas:\n\n6\\. The three Matras (A + U + M), if employed separate, and only joined one to\nanother, are mortal 9;\n\np. 283\n\nbut in acts, external, internal, or intermediate, if well performed, the sage\ntrembles not 1.\n\n7\\. Through the _Ri_ _k_ -verses he arrives at this world, through the Ya _g_\nus-verses at the sky, through the Saman-verses at that which the poets teach,\n--he arrives at this by means of the O\xe1\xb9\x85kara; the wise arrives at that which is\nat rest, free from decay, from death, from fear,--the Highest.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[282:1](sbe15110.htm#fr_911) \xc3\x82yatanena, alambanena.\n\n[282:2](sbe15110.htm#fr_912) Dipikaya _m_ Va _k_ aspatinaivakaramatram ityeva\nvyakhyatam.\n\n[282:3](sbe15110.htm#fr_913) Sampadyate prapnoti _g_ anmeti _s_ esha _h_.\n\n[282:4](sbe15110.htm#fr_914) _S_ rutau t _ri_ tiya dvitiyarthe.\n\n[282:5](sbe15110.htm#fr_915) Literally the mind, but here meant for the moon,\nas before. It is clear that manasi belongs to sampadyate, not, as the Dipika\nand Roer think, to dhyayita. Some take it for svapnabhimani Hira _n_ yagarbha\n_h_.\n\n[282:6](sbe15110.htm#fr_916) The world of Hira _n_ yagarbha _h_ , called the\nSatyaloka.\n\n[282:7](sbe15110.htm#fr_917) On a later addition, bringing in the Om as\nconsisting of three Matras and a half, see Weber, Ind. Stud. I, p. 453; Roer,\np. 238.\n\n[282:8](sbe15110.htm#fr_918) Tadupade _s_ eneti yavat.\n\n[282:9](sbe15110.htm#fr_919) Because in their separate form, A, U, M, they do\nnot mean the Highest Brahman.\n\n[283:1](sbe15110.htm#fr_920) The three acts are explained as waking,\nslumbering, and deep sleep; or as three kinds of pronunciation, tara-mandra-\nmadhyama. They are probably meant for Yoga exercises in which the three Matras\nof Om are used as one word, and as an emblem of the Highest Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Sixth Question](sbe15111.htm)\n\n"
