When Shree Krishnu Chund, the root of joy, came to Dwarka, after\nhaving slain Kaljumun, released Moochkoond, deceived Joorasindhoo, accompanied\nby Buldeo Jee, life was revived in all the descendants of Judoo; and joy was\ndiffused over the whole city: the inhabitants began to enjoy ease and\nhappiness.\n\nSometime after this, several of the descendants of Judoo went one day to the\nRaja Oogursen and said, "O great king! it is now necessary to make some\narrangements for Bulram Jee\'s marriage, because he is of a marriageable age."\n\nOn hearing these words, the Raja Oogursen sent for a brahmin, and entering\ninto many explanations, and giving very particular instructions, said, "Go and\nbetroth Bulram in some good family."\n\nHaving thus spoken, and ordered the mixture rolee, rice, a rupee and a\ncocoanut to be brought, Oogursen marked the brahmin\'s forehead; and presenting\nhim with the rupee and cocoanut allowed him to depart. He pursued his journey,\nand arrived at the abode of the Raja Rewut in the Anurta country. Having\nbetrothed Bulram Jee to his daughter Rewutee,\n\np. 205\n\nand fixed upon a favourable moment, he brought the marks for the forehead by\nthe hands of the Raja\'s brahmin, and presented them to Oogursen at Dwarka; and\ninformed him of all that had occurred, while he was in the Raja\'s country. The\nRaja Oogursen was very much pleased with the account; and, giving a festive\nentertainment, he sent for the brahmin, who had brought the marks, and\nreceived them from him; and dismissed him with a large present of money, and\nafterwards went himself in great splendour and state, accompanied by all the\ndescendants of Judoo, to the country of Anurta, and celebrated Bulram Jee\'s\nmarriage.\n\nHaving proceeded thus far in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo, the sage, said to\nthe Raja,--O lord of the earth! in this manner the descendants of Judoo\ncelebrated Bulram\'s marriage. And Shree Krishnu Chund Jee, accompanied by his\nbrother, went to Koondulpore; and having fought with evil spirits, carried off\nRookmunee, the daughter of the Raja Bheekmuk, who had been betrothed to\nSissoopal; and married her at his own home.\n\nHaving heard this, the Raja Pureechit enquired from Shree Shookdeo Jee, "O sea\nof compassion! how did Shree Krishnu Chund go to Koondulpore, and slay the\nevil spirits, and carry off Bheekmuk\'s daughter, Rookmunee? Please explain\nthese circumstances to me." Shree Shookdeo Jee replied, O great king! listen\nwith attention, and I will give you a full account of all the circumstances.\n\nIn the Bidurbh country there was a city, named Koondulpore, the Raja of which,\nBheekmuk, was renowned, and known to fame in all parts of the world. Shree\nSeeta Jee descended upon the earth in his house. At the birth of his daughter,\nthe Raja sent for astrologers, who came, and having determined upon a\nfortunate moment, named the child Rookmunee, and said, "O great king! we are\nof opinion, that this girl will possess an excellent disposition, be a\nreceptacle of beauty, and equal Luchmee in excellent qualities, and be married\nto the first male, Vishnu."\n\np. 206\n\nWhen the astrologers had thus spoken, Raja Bheekmuk was highly pleased, and\nindulged in great rejoicings and made many presents to brahmins. After this,\nthe girl increased daily in stature, like a digit of the moon; and delighted\nher parents by her childish play. When she was a little older, she engaged in\nall kinds of rare games with her female companions. One day this young\ncreature, with eyes like a deer, a voice like the kokila, complexion like the\nflower chumpa, and a countenance like the moon, went with her companions to\nplay at blind man\'s buff. Whilst engaged in the diversion, her companions said\nto her, "Rookmunee! you have come to spoil our sport; because wherever you\nhide with us in the dark, there is a flood of light from the brilliancy of\nyour moon-like countenance, which prevents our being concealed." On hearing\nthis speech, she smiled and was silent.\n\nHaving narrated thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said, O great\nking! she constantly played in this manner with her companions, and her beauty\ngreatly increased every day. In the mean while Narud Jee came one day to\nKoondulpore; and, having seen Rookmunee, went to Shree Krishnu at Dwarka, and\nsaid, "O great king! a young virgin has been born in the house of the Raja\nBheekmuk, who is a mine of beauty and virtue and excellent qualities, equal to\nLuchmee, and worthy of being wedded to you." From the time he heard this\naccount from Narud Jee, Huri thought of her night and day. In this manner, O\ngreat king! Shree Krishnu Chund heard of the name and excellent qualities of\nRookmunee; and I will now explain how she heard of the fame and celebrity of\nKrishnu. On one occasion several beggars from different countries went to\nKoondulpore, and sung the celebrated exploits of Krishnu, his birth at Muttra,\nhis joining with the cowherds\' children in childish games at Gokool and.\nBrindabun; and how he had made the descendants of Judoo happy by destroying\nevil spirits, and removing the burthens of the earth. All these circumstances\nthey mentioned. On, hearing the\n\np. 207\n\nrecital of Huri\'s wonderful actions, the inhabitants of the city were greatly\nastonished, and said to each other, "When shall we see him, of whose exploits\nwe have heard." By some means, the beggars contrived to enter the court of the\nRaja Bheekmuk, and began to sing of the famous deeds, and the attributes of\nKrishnu. At that time the beautiful Rookmunee had gone up to a balcony; and\nthe voices of the beggars, reciting Krishnu\'s exploits, reached her ears. She\nwondered and was absent in mind; and turning round and peeping, wanted to see\nthe beggars. The Raja\'s daughter, having heard Krishnu\'s history, remained\nabsorbed in thought of him; the creeper of love sprung up in her breast; she\nwas delighted and agitated by turns. Huri stole away her senses, memory and\nmind. Shree Shookdeo Jee continued,--O lord of the earth! in this manner Shree\nRookmunee Jee heard of the fame and celebrity of Krishnu, and from that day\nshe continued to think of him day and night, during the eight puhurs, and\nsixty four ghurees; whether asleep or awake, sitting, standing, walking,\neating, drinking or engaged in amusement; and celebrated his good qualities\nwith songs. She was in the habit of rising very early, and having bathed, and\nmade a mud image of the goddess Parbuttee, she put upon it the mixture roolee,\nrice and flowers; and preparing perfumes, lamps and consecrated food,\npropitiated the goddess with joined hands, and downcast looks, and pronounced\nthese words in presence of the image, "Take pity on me, O Parbuttee! give me\nthe lord of the Judoos as a husband, and remove all my troubles." In this\nmanner Rookmunee passed her life. One day she was amusing herself with her\ncompanions, when the Raja Bheekmuk, beholding her, began to think and say to\nhimself, "She is now of an age to be married; if we do not marry her to some\none quickly, people will laugh. There is a saying, that it is useless for a\nman, in whose house there is a grown-up unmarried daughter, to offer gifts, or\nperform good acts, or be engaged in prayers, or religious penance; because he\n\np. 208\n\nobtains no benefit from the performance of such acts, until he shall have\ndischarged the debt due to his daughter." Having thus reflected, the Raja\nBheekmuk came into his court; and, having summoned all his ministers and\nrelations said, "Brothers! my daughter is marriageable, it is necessary to\nlook out for a bridegroom for her, of good family, a "mine of good qualities,\nan abode of beauty and of a good disposition."\n\nOn hearing these words, they mentioned the families, virtues, personal\nappearance and power of the Rajas of many different countries; but Raja\nBheekmuk did not approve of any of them. Then his eldest son, named Rookum,\nbegan to say, "Father! Sissoopal, the Raja of the city of Chunderee, is very\npowerful, and in every respect our equal, betroth Rookmunee to him, and gain\nreputation in the world."\n\nO great king! when the Raja would not acquiesce in his opinion, his younger\nson, whose name was Rookumkesh, said, "Father! give Rookmunee to Krishnu, and\nbetroth her through Basoodeo." Bheekmuk was highly delighted at these words,\nand commended his son\'s speech: "You, although only a child, are more\nintelligent than the rest, I approve entirely of what you have said; there is\na saying, enquire from persons of high and low degree, in order to give\nconfidence to your own judgment; seize upon what is valuable in the discourse\nof each; this is the custom of the world." After this the Raja again said,\n"Rookumkesh has given good counsel; amongst the descendants of Judoo, the Raja\nSoorsen is very celebrated and of great renown, whose son Basoodeo Jee is; and\nin his house the immortal Vishnu, the god of gods, Shree Krishnu Chund Jee,\nhas been born, and destroyed the mighty Kuns, and all evil spirits; and,\nhaving removed the burthens of the earth, has shed splendour on the family of\nJudoo, and conferred happiness on all the descendants of Judoo, and other\nsubjects; we shall acquire fame and greatness in the world by bestowing\nRookmunee on such\n\np. 209\n\na personage as Shree Krishnu Chund Jee, the lord of Dwarka." At these words,\nall the people of the court were highly delighted, and said, "O great king!\nyou have determined well, and will not meet with such a bridegroom, and of so\ngood a family any where else. It is, therefore, most advisable to give\nRookmunee in marriage to Shree Krishnu Chund Jee." When, O great king! all the\ncourtiers had thus spoken, Raja Bheekmuk\'s eldest son, Rookum, was exceedingly\nwroth, and said, "These stupid, ignorant people speak without thinking, and do\nnot understand Krishnu\'s condition; he has lived with Nund sixteen years, and\nis universally called a cowherd; he tends herds, and wears a blanket, and eats\nhis labourer\'s food, seated on a fig tree: he is a village cowherd, and has no\ncaste or rank. And how do we know whose son he is. Seeing that no one knows\nany thing about his father and mother; some look upon him as the son of the\ncowherd, Nund, and others as Basoodeo\'s son; but no one has yet found out, to\na certainty, whose son Krishnu is; and, therefore, each person speaks of him\nas he pleases. O great king! all people honour and respect us, and know our\nfamily; but since when have the descendants of Judoo become Rajas? What\nmatters it, that lately they have acquired greatness, the first stain cannot\nyet begot rid of? He is called the servant of Oogursen; how can we possibly\nobtain a great name in the world by betrothing Rookmunee to him. There is a\nsaying, that it most fitting to contract marriages, enmities and friendships\nwith equals. And if we give her to Krishnu, the world will call me a cowherd\'s\nbrother-in-law; and my good name and reputation will be utterly ruined." O\ngreat king! Rookum went on to say, "That Raja Sissoopal of the city of\nChunderee was a very mighty and potent prince. From dread of him the world\ntrembles, and the throne has descended in his family from time immemorial.\nYour best plan, therefore, is to give\n\np. 210\n\n[paragraph continues] Rookmunee to him; and please never mention Krishnu\'s\nname again before me."\n\nOn hearing these words, the courtiers felt deep regret, and remained silent\nthrough fear; and the Raja Bheekmuk did not say any thing. Upon this Rookum\nsent for an astrologer; and having fixed upon a lucky day and fortunate\nmoment, forwarded the nuptial gifts to the Raja Sissoopal by the hand of a\nbrahmin, who went with them to the city of Chunderee, to the court of the Raja\nSissoopal. On seeing him, the Raja made a salutation, and enquired from the\nbrahmin, "Say, O god! whence have you come, and with what object?" The brahmin\ngave him his blessing and explained the reasons of his arrival. Raja Sissoopal\nwas delighted at hearing them; and having sent for his family priest, received\nthe nuptial gifts and dismissed the brahmin with many presents. He afterwards\ninvited Joorasindhoo and other Rajas, who came with their armies; and he also\nwent forth with his troops to the marriage. The brahmin, who had taken the\nmarks for the forehead, said on his return to the Raja Bheekmuk, "O great\nking! I have given the marks to the Raja Sissoopal, and he is coming to the\nmarriage in splendid procession: arrange your plans accordingly."\n\nRaja [Bheekmuk](errata.htm#9) was at first very sad, when he heard these\nwords: afterwards, having reflected and thought upon the matter, he went into\nhis palace and mentioned the subject to his wife, who immediately sent for\nmusicians, and invited all her female relations; and gave a great festive\nentertainment, with a view of celebrating the marriage in due form, and with\nall the prescribed ceremonies. The Raja then came forth, and ordered his\nminister and counsellors "To collect together all things necessary for the\nmarriage;" and they immediately carried the Raja\'s order into full effect by\nprocuring every thing. People saw and heard what was being done: and a report\ngot abroad in the city, that "Rookmunee was to have been married to Shree\n\np. 211\n\n[paragraph continues] Krishnu Chund, but the wicked Rookum would not permit\nit; and that now she was to be married to Sissoopal."\n\nHaving recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja\nPureechit,--O lord of the earth! such was the talk in each house in the city:\nand in the palace, the women sang and played, and made the necessary\npreparations; brahmins read the Vedas, and caused all the usual customs of\nmarriage to be duly observed: large kettle-drums resounded in many places;\npillars formed of sprouting plaintain were fixed in the earth, and golden\nwater pots, placed in front of each door; strings of flowers and garlands were\nfastened in every direction, and on one side, the inhabitants of the city\napart, swept and spread with cloths the markets, roads and cross-roads. Whilst\nthere was this bustle and preparation inside and outside the house, some\nfemale friends of Rookmunee came and said to her, Rookum has given thee to\nSissoopal; and now Rookmunee; you have become a queen." Engaged in thought,\nand drooping her head she said, "My affections, words and vows are all centred\nin the lord of the world, (Krishnu.)"\n\nHaving thus spoken, Rookmunee was much depressed in spirits, and sent for a\nbrahmin, to whom she explained all her wishes, with joined hands and with many\nsupplications; and treating him with great consideration, said, "O great king!\ntake my message to Dwarka, and having mentioned it to Dwarkanath (Krishnu),\nbring him here with you, I shall be under the greatest obligation to you, and\nshall think that I am indebted to your kindness in obtaining Shree Krishnu, as\nmy bridegroom." The brahmin replied, "Tell me what message I am to take, and I\nwill mention it to Shree Krishnu Chund. He is the lord of compassion: and if\nhe should compassionately consent to come, I will bring him with me." When the\nbrahmin had thus spoken, Rookmunee Jee gave into his hands a letter, written\nin the most affectionate terms, and said, "Deliver it to Shree Krishnu Chund,\nthe root of joy, and say to him for me, that his servant, with joined hands\nand the\n\np. 212\n\ngreatest supplications, looks upon him, as being acquainted with the secrets\nof the heart, and knowing the inmost thoughts of every one. What more need I\nsay? I have sought his protection: my character is in his hands, let him act\nin such away, that it may be preserved, and come quickly and see me."\n\nWhen Rookmunee Jee, O great king! dismissed the brahmin with these words, he\nmeditated upon Krishnu, and repeating his name started for Dwarka; and through\nhis love for Huri, arrived immediately. On arrival, he beheld the city in the\nmidst of the sea, surrounded on all sides by extensive forests and hills, and\nbeautiful groves; in which were heard the cries of animals, and notes of birds\nof all kinds. There were elegant tanks, filled with pure water; in which the\nlotus was in full bloom, and bees buzzed in swarms around: on the bank, geese\nand cranes and other birds were disporting; gardens of fruits and flowers of\nevery kind extended for many toss, on the borders of which betel plantations\nflourished. Gardeners were standing at the wells, singing sweet melodies; and,\nplying the water-wheels and buckets, poured forth water in every direction;\nand the quays were thronged with female water-carriers. As the brahmin\nprogressed, after having viewed this beautiful scene with delight, he saw very\nlofty castles on all sides of the city, having four gates, and doors studded\nwith jewels, and inlaid with gold. Inside the city were five and seven-storied\nhouses of gold and jewels, glittering with great splendour, and reaching to\nthe sky: the spires of which were as resplendent as lightning. Flags and\nbanners of various colours were waving: perfumed odours came forth from the\ndoors, blinds, air-holes and trellis-work: at each door were pillars of\nplantain sprouts, and golden water-pots, filled with water: wreaths of flowers\nand garlands were fastened in every direction; and there were sounds of\nmusical rejoicing in every house. In many places the Pooranus were recited,\nand people discoursed of Huri. The eighteen different classes lived happily\nand at ease, the quoit Soodursun protecting the city.\n\np. 213\n\nHaving recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--Raja!\nviewing this beautiful and elegant city, the brahmin arrived at the court of\nthe Raja Oogursen; and, giving him his blessing enquired, "Where does Shree\nKrishnu Chund Jee dwell?" Some one pointed out his house; and when he arrived,\nand stood before the gate, the watchmen made a salutation on seeing him, and\nenquired, "Say, whence do you come, and from what country have you brought a\nletter?" He replied, "I am a brahmin, and an inhabitant of Koondulpore, and\nhave come to deliver a letter to Shree Krishnu Chund from Rookmunee, the\ndaughter of Raja Bheekmuk." The door-keepers answered, "Be pleased to go into\nthe house, Shree Krishnu Chund is sitting opposite on a throne." At these\nwords, when the brahmin entered, Huri, on seeing him, immediately descended\nfrom his throne, and making a salutation, received him with the greatest\nrespect and dignity.\n\nHaving seated him on his throne, and washed his feet, he took the water with\nwhich his feet had been washed, and waited upon him with the same assiduity,\nthat a person would observe in attending upon a deity.\n\nAt length Krishnu, having rubbed him with perfumed paste, and having finished\nhis ablutions, placed before him all kinds of delicacies; and afterwards\npresented him with pawn, and sprinkling him with saffron and sandal, placing a\ngarland of flowers on his neck, took him to a chamber, ornamented with\nprecious gems, and placed him on a bed with curtains, and studded with jewels.\n\nO great king! he was weary and fatigued with his journey, and soon fell into a\nmost pleasant sleep. Shree Krishnu sat for a long time near him from an\nanxious desire to hear what he had to communicate to him; and kept constantly\nsaying to himself, "That the brahmin would wake soon." When, at length, he\nfound that he would not rise, he became uneasy; and sitting at the foot of his\nbed, began to rub his feet. The brahmin was awakened by this, and sat up. Then\nHuri made\n\np. 214\n\nkind enquiries, and said, "Your government, country and person are auspicious,\nexplain to me your circumstances, for what purpose have you come here, and\nconferred happiness on me by your arrival?" The brahmin replied, "O abode of\nmercy! be pleased to listen with attention, and I will explain the reasons of\nmy coming: Since, O great king! the daughter of Bheekmuk, Raja of Koondulpore,\nheard of your great name, and your many excellent qualities, she has her\nthoughts fixed on you constantly, night and day, and desires to attend upon\nyour lotus-like feet. A chance offered of her doing so, but it was rendered\nunsuccessful." Krishnu enquired, "What the chance was?" The brahmin said, "O\nkind to the poor! one day the Raja Bheekmuk having assembled all his courtiers\nand relations, said to them, \'Brothers! my daughter is of an age to be\nmarried; we must now fix upon a husband for her.\' When the Raja had thus\nspoken, they mentioned the families, virtues, renown and power of a great many\nRajas, of whom, however, he did not approve. Upon this, Rookumkesh mentioned\nyour name, at which the Raja was delighted, and acquiesced in what he\nproposed, and said to them all, \'Brothers!\' his words are engraved in my mind,\nas though they had been engraved on stone, what is your opinion?\' They\nreplied, \'If, O great king! you were to search the aggregate of the three\nworlds, you would not meet with such a bridegroom, and such a family as his:\nfor which reason, you should, without any delay, quickly give Rookmunee in\nmarriage to Shree Krishnu Jee.\' O great king! this had been resolved upon,\nwhen Rookum prevented its being carried into effect, and betrothed Rookmunee\nto Sissoopal; and he has gone forth to the marriage, taking all his army of\nevil spirits with him."\n\nHaving recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O lord of\nthe earth! the brahmin, having thus informed Huri, delivered Rookmunee Jee\'s\nletter to him, who\n\np. 215\n\nreceived it with the utmost affection, and placed it in his breast; and after\nreading it said with delight to the brahmin, O divinity! suffer not any\nanxiety; I will accompany you, and, having slain the evil spirits, will fulfil\nRookmunee\'s wishes."\n\nThe brahmin was restored to confidence by these words; but Huri was occupied\nwith anxious thoughts of Rookmunee.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LIV](psa55.htm)\n\n'
