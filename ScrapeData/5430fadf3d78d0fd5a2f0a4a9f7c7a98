If it be said (that the pradhana moves) like milk or water, (we reply\nthat) there also (the motion is due to intelligence).\n\nWell, the Sa _n_ khya resumes, listen then to the following instances.--As\nnon-sentient milk flows forth from its own nature merely for the nourishment\nof the young animal, and as non-sentient water, from its own nature, flows\nalong for the benefit of mankind, so the pradhana also, although non-\nintelligent, may be supposed to move from its own nature merely for the\npurpose of effecting the highest end of man.\n\nThis argumentation, we reply, is unsound again; for as the adherents of both\ndoctrines admit that motion is not observed in the case of merely non-\nintelligent things such as chariots, &c., we infer that water and milk also\nmove only because they are directed by intelligent powers. Scriptural\npassages, moreover (such as 'He who dwells in\n\np. 370\n\nthe water and within the water, who rules the water within,' B _ri_. Up. III,\n7, 4; and, 'By the command of that Akshara, O Gargi, some rivers flow to the\nEast,' &c., B _ri_. Up. III, 8, 9), declare that everything in this world\nwhich flows is directed by the Lord. Hence the instances of milk and water as\nbelonging themselves to that class of cases which prove our general principle\n1 cannot be used to show that the latter is too wide.--Moreover, the cow,\nwhich is an intelligent being and loves her calf, makes her milk flow by her\nwish to do so, and the milk is in addition drawn forth by the sucking of the\ncalf. Nor does water move either with absolute independence--for its flow\ndepends on the declivity of the soil and similar circumstances--or\nindependently of an intelligent principle, for we have shown that the latter\nis present in all cases--If, finally, our opponent should point to Sutra II,\n1, 24 as contradicting the present Sutra, we remark that there we have merely\nshown on the ground of ordinary experience that an effect may take place in\nitself independently of any external instrumental cause; a conclusion which\ndoes not contradict the doctrine, based on Scripture, that all effects depend\non the Lord.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[370:1](sbe34179.htm#fr_329) Viz. that whatever moves or acts does so under\nthe influence of intelligence.--Sadhyapakshanikshiptatva _m_ sadhyavati pakshe\npravish _t_ atvam eva ta _k_ _k_ a sapakshanikshiptatvasyapy upalaksha _n_ am,\nanpanyaso na vyabhi _k_ arabhumir ity artha _h_. \xc3\x82n.
