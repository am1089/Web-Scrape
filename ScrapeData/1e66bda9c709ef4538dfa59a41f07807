Jumna's waves with Ganga's tide,  \nFrom many a holy flood beside,  \nFrom brook and fountain far and near,  \nFrom pool and river, sea and mere.  \nAnd there were honey, curd, and oil,  \nParched rice and grass, the garden's spoil,  \nFresh milk, eight girls in bright attire,  \nAn elephant with eyes of tire;  \nAnd urns of gold and silver made,  \nWith milky branches overlaid,  \nAll brimming from each sacred flood,  \nAnd decked with many a lotus bud  \n\np. 110  \n\nAnd dancing-women fair and free,  \nGay with their gems, were there to see,  \nWho stood in bright apparel by  \nWith lovely brow and witching eye.  \nWhite flashed the jewelled chouri there,  \nAnd shone like moonbeams through the air;  \nThe white umbrella overhead  \nA pale and moonlike lustre shed,  \nWont in pure splendour to precede,  \nAnd in such rites the pomp to lead.  \nThere stood the charger by the side  \nOf the great bull of snow-white hide;  \nThere was all music soft and loud,  \nAnd bards and minstrels swelled the crowd.  \nFor now the monarch bade combine  \nEach custom of his ancient line  \nWith every rite Ayodhya's state  \nObserved, her kings to consecrate.  \n\nThen, summoned by the king's behest,  \nThe multitudes together pressed,  \nAnd, missing still the royal sire,  \nBegan, impatient, to inquire:  \n'Who to our lord will tidings bear  \nThat all his people throng the square?  \nWhere is the king? the sun is bright,  \nAnd all is ready for the rite.'  \n\nAs thus they spoke, Sumantra, tried  \nIn counsel, to the chiefs replied,  \nGathered from lands on every side:  \n'To Rama's house I swiftly drave,  \nFor so the king his mandate gave.  \nOur aged lord and Rama too  \nIn honour high hold all of you:  \nI in your words (be long your days!)  \nWill ask him why he thus delays.'  \n\nThus spoke the peer in Scripture read,  \nAnd to the ladies' bower he sped.  \nQuick through the gates Sumantra hied,  \nWhich access ne'er to him denied.  \nBehind the curtained screen he drew,  \nWhich veiled the chamber from the view.  \nIn benediction loud he raised  \nHis voice, and thus the monarch praised:  \n'Sun, Moon, Kuvera, S'iva bless  \nKakutstha's son with high success!  \nThe Lords of air, flood, fire decree  \nThe victory, my King, to thee!  \nThe holy night has past away,  \nAuspicious shines the morning's ray.  \nRise, Lord of men, thy part to take  \nIn the great rite. Awake! awake!  \nBrahmans and captains, chiefs of trade,  \nAll wait in festive garb arrayed;  \nFor thee they look with eager eyes:  \nO Raghu's son, awake! arise.'  \n\nTo him in holy Scripture read,  \nWho hailed him thus, the monarch said,  \nUpraising from his sleep his head:  \n'Go. Rama hither lead as thou  \nW ( _illegible_ ) but now.  \nCome, tell me why my mandate laid  \nUpon thee thus is disobeyed.  \nAway! and Rama hither bring;  \nI sleep not: make no tarrying.'  \n\nThus gave the king command anew:  \nSumantra from his lord withdrew;  \nWith head in lowly reverence bent,  \nAnd filled with thoughts of joy, he went,  \nThe royal street he traversed, where  \nWaved flag and pennon to the air,  \nAnd, as with joy the car he drove,  \nHe let his eyes delighted rove.  \nOn every side, where'er he came,  \nHe heard glad words, their theme the same,  \nAs in their joy the gathered folk  \nOf Rama and the throning spoke.  \nThen saw he Rama's palace bright  \nAnd vast as Mount Kailasa's height,  \nThat glorious in its beauty showed  \nAs Indra's own supreme abode:  \nWith folding doors both high and wide;  \nWith hundred porches beautified:  \nWhere golden statues towering rose  \nO'er gemmed and coralled porticoes  \nBright like a cave in Meru's side,  \nOr clouds through Autumn's sky that ride:  \nFestooned with length of bloomy twine,  \nFlashing with pearls and jewels' shine,  \nWhile sandal-wood and aloe lent  \nThe mingled riches of their scent;  \nWith all the odorous sweets that fill  \nThe breezy heights of Dardar's hill.  \nThere by the gate the Saras screamed,  \nAnd shrill-toned peacocks' plumage gleamed.  \nIts floors with deftest art inlaid,  \nIts sculptured wolves in gold arrayed,  \nWith its bright sheen the palace took  \nThe mind of man and chained the look,  \nFor like the sun and moon it glowed,  \nAnd mocked Kuvera's loved abode.  \nCircling the walls a crowd he viewed  \nWho stood in reverent attitude,  \nWith throngs of countrymen who sought  \nAcceptance of the gifts they brought.  \nThe elephant was stationed there,  \nAppointed Rama's self to bear;  \nAdorned with pearls, his brow and cheek  \nWere sandal-dyed in many a streak,  \nWhile he, in stature, bulk, and pride,  \nWith Indra's own Airavat  1 vied.  \nSumantra, borne by coursers fleet,  \nFlashing a radiance o'er the street,  \n   To Rama's palace flew,  \nAnd all who lined the royal road,  \nOr thronged the prince's rich abode,  \n   Rejoiced as near he drew.  \nAnd with delight his bosom swelled  \nAs onward still his course he held  \n\np. 111  \n\n   Through many a sumptuous court  \nLike Indra's palace nobly made,  \nWhere peacocks revelled in the shade,  \n   And beasts of silvan sort.  \nThrough many a hall and chamber wide,  \nThat with Kailasa's splendour vied.  \n   Or mansions of the Blest,  \nWhile Rama's friends, beloved and tried,  \nBefore his coming stepped aside,  \n   Still on Sumantra pressed.  \nHe reached the chamber door, where stood  \nAround his followers young and good,  \nBard, minstrel, charioteer,  \nWell skilled the tuneful chords to sweep,  \nWith soothing strain to lull to sleep,  \n   Or laud their master dear.  \nThen, like a dolphin darting through  \nUnfathomed depths of ocean's blue  \n   With store of jewels decked,  \nThrough crowded halls that rock-like rose,  \nOr as proud hills where clouds repose,  \n   Sumantra sped unchecked--  \nHalls like the glittering domes on high  \nReared for the dwellers of the sky  \n   By heavenly architect.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[110:1](ry093.htm#fr_280) The elephant of Indra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XVI.: Rama Summoned.](ry094.htm)\n\n"
