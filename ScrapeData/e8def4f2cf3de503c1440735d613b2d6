A rock carving at Elephanta, which depicts the\nsupreme god with three heads, indicates that the conception is of considerable\nantiquity. To what particular period it must be assigned, however, we cannot\nyet definitely decide.\n\nThe religious history of India is divided into four Ages: (1) the Vedic Age;\n(2) the Brahmanical Age; (3) the Buddhist Age; and (4) the Age of the reform\nand revival of Brahmanism.\n\nAs we have seen, many gods were worshipped in the Vedic Age, but ere it had\nended Pantheistic ideas found expression in the hymns. Two distinct currents\nof thought characterize the Brahmanical Age. On the one hand there was the\ngrowth of priestly influence which is\n\np. 120\n\nthe feature of the _Brahmanas_ , and on the other the development of the bold\nPantheism of the _Upanishads_ , which are permeated with a catholicity of\nspirit directly opposed to narrow and pedantic ritualism. Towards the close of\nthis Age, Vishnu and Shiva were deities of growing ascendancy.\n\nThe Buddhist Age began in the sixth century before Christ, and Buddhism\ngradually supplanted Brahmanism as a national religion. In the tenth century\nof our era, however, Brahmanism was revived, drawing its inspiration mainly\nfrom the _Upanishads_ , and purified by the teachings of Buddha and other\nreformers.\n\nThese religious movements of the post-Vedic times, which have exercised a\ncumulative influence in shaping modern-day Hinduism, were due directly and\nindirectly to the speculative reasonings of the unknown authors of the\n_Upanishads_. The Pantheistic doctrines of these ancient philosophers,\nhowever, hardly constituted a religion: they were rather an esoteric system of\nbelief devoid of popular appeal. But they have been the inspiration of a\nsuccession of profound thinkers and eloquent teachers of revered memory in\nIndia, who infused ancient modes of thought with high philosophic doctrines,\nand utilized archaic myths to develop a religion which in its purest form\npermeates the acts of everyday life and requires the whole-hearted devotion\nand service of pious Hindus to the will of the Supreme Being.\n\nIn the Brahmanical Age Upanishadic teachings made limited appeal, but\nevidences are not awanting that knowledge of them was not confined to the\nBrahmans, because the revolts which gave India Buddhism and Jainism originated\namong the Kshatriyas. Meanwhile the gods of the _Vedas_ continued their hold\nupon the allegiance of the great masses of the people, although the ancient\nVedic\n\n\n\n[![THE HINDU TRINITY AT ELEPHANTA](tn/12000.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/12000.jpg)  \nTHE HINDU TRINITY AT ELEPHANTA  \n\n(see page 119)\n\n\n\np. 121\n\nreligion had been divested of its simplicity and directness by the ritualistic\npriesthood. Gods and men depended upon the Brahmans for their prosperity and\neven for their continued existence. It was taught that the "gods lived in fear\nof death, the strong Ender", but were supported and fed by penance and\nsacrifice. The priests achieved spiritual dominion over their rivals, the\nKshatriyas.\n\nThere was, however, more than one "school of thought" among the Brahmans. The\nsages who memorized and repeated the older Upanishads, and composed new ones,\ncould not have failed to pass unrecorded judgments on the superstitious\npractices of their ritualistic brethren. Account must also be taken of the\nexample and teachings of the hands of wandering devotees, the Bhiksus, who\nneither performed penances nor offered up sacrifices, and of the influence\nexercised by the independent thinkers among the Kshatriyas, who regarded with\ndisfavour the pretensions of the powerful priesthood. The elements of revolt\ncould never have been absent during the two centuries of the Brahmanical Age.\nUpanishadic teachings had stirred the minds of thinking men, but they had one\nmarked defect; they left unsatisfied the religious sense which could find no\nrepose in a jungle of abstract thought. It was impossible, however, for the\nleaders of thought to return to the polytheism of the Vedic Age, or to worship\ndeities controlled by human beings. A new and higher religion became a\nnecessity for those who, like the Hebrew Psalmist, appear to have cried:\n\n"O Lord . . . thou desirest not sacrifice, else would I give it; thou\ndelightest not in burnt offering. The sacrifices of God are a broken\nspirit."-- _Psalms_ , li, 16, 17.\n\nAt any rate, we find that, before the Brahmanical Age\n\np. 122\n\nhad ended, the conception was becoming more prevalent of a supreme personal\ngod, greater than Indra or Agni, and worthy of minds influenced by the\nUpanishads--a god who was the embodiment of the First Cause, an Infinite Being\nuncontrolled by the priesthood. One section of the people appears to have\nworshipped Vishnu as the Celestial incarnation of the World Soul, while\nanother gave recognition to Shiva. In the absence of records, however, it is\nimpossible to ascertain to what extent monotheistic ideas were developed by\nunorthodox teachers. The new doctrines may have degenerated, like Buddhism, as\nthey became widespread. It is evident, however, that the priesthood were\nunable to ignore them, for they are referred to in their "books".\n\nAlthough the political prominence of Vishnu and Shiva belong to the Age of\nreformed Brahmanism, it is undoubted that both deities were worshipped\nthroughout the long period of Buddhistic ascendancy. The Greek ambassador\nMegasthenes, who resided in India between B.C. 311 and 302, and wrote _Ta\nIndika_ , furnishes interesting evidence in this connection. "By his\ndescription of the god Dionysus, whom they worshipped in the mountains,\nShiva", says Professor Macdonell, "must be intended, and by Herakles, adored\nin the plains . . . no other can be meant than Vishnu and his incarnation\nKrishna. . . . These statements seem to justify the conclusion that Shiva and\nVishnu were already prominent as highest gods, the former in the mountains,\nthe latter in the Ganges valley. . . . We also learn from Megasthenes that the\ndoctrine of the four Ages of the World (Yugas) was fully developed in India by\nthis time." 1\n\nIn the _Rigveda_ Vishnu is a god of grace. He is, however, a secondary deity--\nan attribute of the sun and\n\np. 123\n\na phase of Agni. From the earliest times, it is significant to note, his\nbenevolent character is emphasized. In one of the hymns 1 he is called "the\nKinsman"; he welcomed to his heaven of bliss the faithful worshippers of the\ngods. An interesting reference is made to his "highest step". As detailed in\nlater writings, the myth involved is to the effect that the demon Bali, one of\nthe dreaded Danavas (Titans), had, in the Treta Yuga, secured temporary\nascendancy over the gods. Vishnu appeared before him in the form of the dwarf\nVamana, and requested as much territory as he could measure out by taking\nthree strides. The demon granted this request, and Vishnu immediately assumed\nthe form of a giant; his first step covered the heavens, the second crossed\nthe entire earth, and the third and highest reached the abode of the gods. So\nwas the Universe won back from the Asuras. It is believed that the myth refers\nto the progress of the conquering sun by day and by night.\n\nIn _Yajurveda_ Vishnu is more prominent than in the Rigveda, and in the\n_Brahmanas_ "there is a growing tendency", remarks Professor Barnett, "to\nregard him as a blessed Cosmic Spirit". 2 He is fully identified with Brahma\nin the _Mah abharata_. In some of the myths he is the source of Indra\'s\nstrength and valour, and he appears to have absorbed the sublime character of\nVaruna, the god of sinners; he is similarly associated with the sea, but the\nSea of Milk.\n\nShiva is a development of the Vedic storm god Rudra, who was not only dreaded,\nbut also revered as a destroyer of evil-doers, hatred, evil, and disease, and\nas a nourisher who gave long life. 3\n\nBoth deities inspired love and reverential fear; they\n\np. 124\n\nwon the affections of human hearts and were worshipped emotionally. Their\ncults have had independent doctrinal . development, however, and they divide\nHinduism to-day into two great churches, one of which recognizes Vishnu, and\nthe other Shiva, as the greatest god. Their union in the Trinity has not yet\nobliterated sectarian differences.\n\nMany myths have collected round Vishnu, originally a purely abstract deity,\nbecause the faith which he represents had to be imparted to the masses in\n"parables". These "parables" were, of course, given literal interpretation by\nthe people. The majority of the myths belong to the post-Buddhist Age--the Age\nof Brahmanical revival, during which came into existence the sacred poems\ncalled the _Puranas_. Many were also incorporated in the great epics, the _Mah\nabharata_ and the _Ram ayana_, which existed in part, at least, before the\nrise of Buddhism and Jainism.\n\nWhen Vishnu, the god of mercy and goodness, received recognition as Narayana\nin the Brahmanical Age, he was worshipped as the "unconquerable preserver" who\nat the dawn of each Yuga (Age) awoke as the child of the primordial waters. In\none myth he rises from a lotus bloom; in another he is supposed to sleep, as\nBrahma, on the coils of the world-serpent Shesha, which is "a part of a part\nof Vishnu". This serpent rests on the tortoise, Kurma, another form of Vishnu.\nWhen the tortoise moves its limbs, Shesha is roused to yawn; thus are\nearthquakes caused. A creation myth which teaches the absolute supremacy of\nVishnu tells that at the beginning Brahma sprang from a lotus issuing from the\nnavel of the Preserver, while Shiva came from his forehead.\n\nVishnu is a dark god with four arms; in one of his right hands he holds a\nwarshell, and in the other a\n\n\n\n[![VISHNU UPHOLDING THE UNIVERSE<br> <i>From a sculpture at\nMamallapuram</i>.](tn/12400.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/12400.jpg)  \nVISHNU UPHOLDING THE UNIVERSE  \n_From a sculpture at Mamallapuram_.  \n\n\n\np. 125\n\nflaming discus, which destroys enemies and returns after it is flung; in one\nleft hand he holds a mace, and in the other a lotus bloom.\n\nThe belief that the Supreme Being from time to time "assumes a human form . .\n. for the preservation of rectitude and morality" is an outstanding feature of\nVishnuite religion, which teaches that Vishnu was born among men as\nRamachandra, Krishna, Balarama, and Buddha. These are the Avataras of the\nPreserver. Avatara means literally "a descent", but is used in the sense of an\n"Incarnation".\n\nRama Chandra is the hero of the _Ram ayana_ epic, which is summarized in our\nclosing chapters; he is the human ideal of devotion, righteousness, and\nmanliness, the slayer of the demon Ravana, who oppressed and persecuted\nmankind.\n\nKrishna and his brother Balarama figure as princes of Dwaraka in the _Mah\nabharata_. Krishna is represented as the teacher of the Vishnuite faith, the\ndevotional religion which displaced the Vedic ceremonies and links Upanishadic\ndoctrines with modern Hinduism. It recognizes that all men are sinful, and\npreaches salvation by Knowledge which embraces Works. Sinners must surrender\nthemselves to Krishna, the human incarnation (Avatara) of Vishnu, the\nPreserver, the God of Love.\n\nThis faith is unfolded in the famous _Bhagavad-gita_  1 in the _Bhishma Parva_\nsection of the _Mah abharata_ epic. Krishna is acting as the counsellor and\ncharioteer of the Pandava warrior Arjuna. Ere the first day\'s battle of the\nGreat War begins, the human Avatara of Vishnu reveals himself to his friend as\nthe Divine Being, and gives instruction as to how men may obtain salvation.\n\nKrishna teaches that the soul is "unborn, unchangeable,\n\np. 126\n\neternal, and ancient"; it is one with the Supreme Soul, Vishnu, the First\nCause, the Source of All. The soul "is not slain when the body is slain"; it\nenters new bodies after each death, or else it secures emancipation from sin\nand suffering by being absorbed in the World Soul. . . . All souls have to go\nthrough a round of births. "On attaining to Me, however," says Krishna, "there\nis no rebirth."\n\nKrishna gives Salvation to those who obtain "Knowledge of self or Brahma". . .\n. He says: "The one who hath devoted his Self (Soul) to abstraction, casting\nan equal eye everywhere, beholdeth his Self in all creatures, and all\ncreatures in his Self. Unto him that beholdeth Me in everything and beholdeth\neverything in Me, I am never lost and he also is never lost in Me. He that\nworshippeth Me as abiding in all creatures, holding yet that All is One, is a\ndevotee, and whatever mode of life he may lead, he liveth in Me. . . .\n\n"Even if thou art the greatest sinner among all that are sinful, thou shalt\nyet cross over all transgressions by the raft of Knowledge". . . . Knowledge\ndestroys all sins. It is obtained by devotees who, "casting off attachment,\nperform actions for attaining purity of Self, with the body, the mind, the\nunderstanding, and even the senses, free from desire". To such men "a sod, a\nstone, and gold are alike".\n\nKrishna, as Vishnu, is thus revealed: "I am the productive cause of the entire\nUniverse and also its destroyer. There is nothing else that is higher than\nmyself. . . . I am Om (the Trinity) in all the Vedas, the sound in space, the\nmanliness in man. I am the fragrant odour in earth, the splendour in fire, the\nlife in all creatures, and penance in ascetics. . . . I am the thing to be\nknown, the means by which everything is cleansed. . . . I am the soul\n\np. 127\n\n[paragraph continues] (self) seated in the heart of every being. I am the\nbeginning, the middle, and the end of all beings. . . . I am the letter A (in\nthe Sanskrit alphabet). . . . I am Death that seizeth all, and the source of\nall that is to be. . . . He that knoweth me as the Supreme Lord of the worlds,\nwithout birth and beginning . . . is free from all sins. . . . He who doeth\neverything for me, who hath me for his supreme object, who is freed from\nattachment, who is without enmity towards all beings, even he cometh to me. .\n. . He through whom the world is not troubled, and who is not troubled by the\nworld, who is free from joy, wrath, fear, and anxieties, even he is dear to\nme."\n\nTo Arjuna Krishna says: "Exceedingly dear art thou to me. Therefore I will\ndeclare what is for thy benefit. Set thy heart on Me, become my devotee,\nsacrifice to me, bow down to me. Then shalt thou come to me. . . . Forsaking\nall (religious) duties, come to me as thy sole refuge. I will deliver thee\nfrom all sins. Do not grieve."\n\nIt is, however, added: "This is not to be declared by thee to one who\npractiseth no austerities, to one who is not a devotee, to one who never\nwaiteth on a preceptor, nor yet to one who calumniateth Me."\n\nUnbelievers are those who are devoid of knowledge. Krishna says: "One who hath\nno knowledge and no faith, whose mind is full of doubt, is lost. . . . Doers\nof evil, ignorant men, the worst of their species . . . do not resort to Me."\n. . . Such men "return to the path of the world that is subject to\ndestruction". He denounces "persons of demoniac natures" because they are\ndevoid of "purity, good conduct, and truth. . . . They say that the Universe\nis void of truth, of guiding principle and of ruler. . . . Depending on this\nview\n\np. 128\n\nthese men of lost souls, of little intelligence and fierce deeds, these\nenemies of the world, are born for the destruction of the Universe." They\n"cherish boundless hopes, limited by death alone", and "covet to obtain\nunfairly hoards of wealth for the gratification of their desires"; they say,\n"This foe hath been slain by me--I will slay others. . . . I am lord, I am the\nenjoyer. . . . I am rich and of noble birth--who else is there that is like\nme? . . . I will make gifts, I will be merry. . . Thus deluded by ignorance,\ntossed about by numerous thoughts, enveloped in the meshes of delusion,\nattached to the enjoyment of objects of desire, they sink into foul hell. . .\nThreefold is the way to hell, ruinous to the Self (Soul), namely, lust, wrath,\nlikewise avarice. . . . Freed from these three gates of darkness, a man works\nout his own welfare, and then repairs to the highest goal." 1\n\nBalarama is an incarnation of the world serpent Shesha. According to the\nlegend, he and Krishna are the sons of Vasudeva and Devaki. It was revealed to\nKansa, King of Mat\xc2\xb4hura 2, who was a worshipper of Shiva, that a son of Devaki\nwould slay him. His majesty therefore commanded that Devaki\'s children should\nbe slain as soon as they were born. Balarama, who was fair, was carried safely\naway. Krishna, the dark son, performed miracles soon after birth. The king had\nhis father and mother fettered, and the doors of the houses were secured with\nlocks. But the chains fell from Vasudeva, and the doors flew open when he\nstole out into the night to conceal the babe. As he crossed the river Jumna,\ncarrying Krishna on his head in a basket, the waters rose high and threatened\nto drown him, but the child put out a foot and the river immediately fell and\n\n\n\n[![KRISHNA AND THE GOPIS \\(HERDSMAIDS\\)<br> <i>From a modern\nsculpture</i>](tn/12800.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/12800.jpg)  \nKRISHNA AND THE GOPIS (HERDSMAIDS)  \n_From a modern sculpture_  \n\n\n\np. 129\n\nbecame shallow. In Mathura the two brothers performed miraculous feats during\ntheir youth. Indeed, the myths connected with them suggest that their\nprototypes were voluptuous pastoral gods. Krishna, the flute-player and\ndancer, is the shepherd lover of the Gopis or herdsmaids, his favourite being\nRadha. He was opposed to the worship of Indra, and taught the people to make\nofferings to a sacred mountain.\n\nKing Kansa had resort to many stratagems to accomplish the death of Krishna,\nbut his own doom could not be set aside; ultimately he was slain by the two\nbrothers. The _Harivamsa_ , an appendix to the _Mah abharata_, which is as\nlong as the Iliad and the Odyssey together, is devoted to the life and\nadventures of Krishna, who also figures in the _Puranas_.\n\nVishnu\'s Buddha Avatara was assumed, according to orthodox teaching, to bring\nabout the destruction of demons and wicked men who refused to acknowledge the\ninspiration of the Vedas and the existence of deities, and were opposed to the\ncaste system. This attitude was assumed by the Brahmans because Buddhism was a\nserious lay revolt against Brahmanical doctrines and ceremonial practices.\n\nBuddha, "the Enlightened", was Prince Siddartha of the royal family Gautama,\nwhich, as elsewhere told, ruled over a Sakya tribe. At his birth marvellous\nsigns foretold his greatness. Reared in luxury, he was kept apart from the\ncommon people; but when the time of his awakening came, he was greatly\nsaddened to behold human beings suffering from disease, sorrow, and old age.\nOne night he left his wife and child, and went away to live the life of a\ncontemplative hermit in the forest, with purpose to find a solution for the\ngreat problem of human sin and suffering. He came under\n\np. 130\n\nthe influence of Upanishadic doctrines, and at the end of six years he\nreturned and began his mission.\n\nBuddha, the great psychologist, was one of the world\'s influential teachers,\nbecause his doctrines have been embraced in varying degrees of purity by about\na third of the human race. Yet they are cold and unsatisfying and gloomy. The\n"Enlightener\'s" outlook on life was intensely timid and pessimistic; he was an\n"enemy of society" in the sense that he made no attempt to effect social\nreforms so as to minimize human suffering, which touched him with deepest\nsympathy, but unfortunately filled him with despair; his solution for all\nproblems was Death; he was the apostle of benevolent Nihilism and Idealistic\nAtheism.\n\nThere is no supreme personal god in Buddhism and no hope of immortality. Gods\nand demons and human beings are "living creatures"; gods have no power over\nthe Universe, and need not be worshipped or sacrificed to, because they are\ngoverned by laws, and men have nothing to fear from them.\n\nBuddha denied the existence of the Self-Soul of the _Upanishads_. Self is not\nGod, in the sense that it is a phase of the World Soul. The "self-state" is,\naccording to the "Enlightener", a combination of five elements--matter,\nfeeling, imagination, will, and consciousness; these are united by Kamma, 1\nthe influence which causes life to repeat itself. Buddha had accepted, in a\nlimited sense, the theory of Transmigration of Souls. He taught, however, that\nrebirth was the result of actions and desire. "It is the yearning for\nexistence", he said, "which leads from new birth to new birth, which finds its\ndesire in different directions, the desire for pleasure, the desire for\nexistence, the desire for power." Death occurs when\n\n\n\n[![BUDDHA EXPOUNDING THE LAW](tn/13000.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/13000.jpg)  \nBUDDHA EXPOUNDING THE LAW  \n\n\n\np. 131\n\nthe five elements which constitute life are divided; after death nothing\nremains but the consequences of actions and thoughts. Rebirth follows because\n"the yearning", the essence of "works", brings the elements together again.\nThe individual exists happily, or the reverse, according to his conduct in a\nformer life; sorrow and disease are results of wrong living and wrong thinking\nin previous states of existence.\n\nThe aim of the Buddhist is to become the "master of his fate". Life to him is\nhateful because, as the Enlightener taught, "birth is suffering, death is\nsuffering; to be joined to one thou dost not love is suffering, to be divided\nfrom thy love is suffering, to fail in thy desire is suffering; in short, the\nfivefold bonds that unite us to earth--those of the five elements--are\nsuffering". As there can be no life without suffering in various degrees, it\nbehoves the believer to secure complete emancipation from the fate of being\nreborn. Life is a dismal and tragic failure. The Buddhist must therefore\ndestroy the influence which unites the five elements and forms another life.\nHe must achieve the complete elimination of inclination--of the yearning for\nexistence. Buddha\'s "sacred truth", which secures the desired end, is eight-\nfold--" right belief; right resolve, right speech, right action, right life,\nright desire, right thought, and right self-absorption". The reward of the\nfaithful, who attains to perfect knowledge, unsullied by works, is eternal\nemancipation by Nirvana, undisturbed repose or blissful extinction 1, which is\nthe Supreme Good. If there had been no belief in rebirth, the solution would\nhave been found in suicide.\n\np. 132\n\nBuddha taught that the four Noble Verities are: (1) pain, (2) desire, the\ncause of pain, (3) pain is extinguished by Nirvana, (4) the way which leads to\nNirvana. The obliteration of Desire is the first aim of the Buddhist. This\ninvolves the renunciation of the world and of all evil passions; the believer\nmust live a perfect life according to the Buddhist moral code, which is as\nstrict as it is idealistic in the extreme. "It does not express friendship, or\nthe feeling of particular affection which a man has for one or more of his\nfellow creatures, but that universal feeling which inspires us with goodwill\ntowards all men and constant willingness to help them." 1\n\nBelief in the sanctity of life is a prevailing note in Buddhism. The teacher\nforbade the sacrifice of animals, as did Isaiah in Judah.\n\n"To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the Lord:\nI am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I\ndelight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats."\n_Isaiah_ , i, 11.\n\nBrahmanism was influenced in this regard, for offerings to Vishnu were\nconfined to cakes, curds, sweetmeats, flowers, oblations, &c.\n\nBuddha, the enemy of the priesthood, was of the Kshatriya caste, and his\nreligion appears to have appealed to aristocrats satiated with a luxurious and\nidle life, who felt like the Preacher that "all is vanity"; it also found\nnumerous adherents among the wandering bands of unorthodox devotees. The\nperfect Buddhist had to live apart from the world, and engage for long\nintervals in introspective contemplation so as to cultivate by a stern\nanalytic process that frame of mind which enabled him to obliterate Desire\nblankly and coldly. Familiar statues of Buddha\n\np. 133\n\nshow the posture which must be assumed; the legs are crossed and twisted, and\nthe hands arranged to suggest inaction; the eyes gaze on the bridge of the\nnose.\n\nMonastic orders came into existence for men and women, but the status of women\nwas not raised. From these orders were excluded all officials and the victims\nof infectious and incurable diseases. A lower class of Buddhists engaged in\nworldly duties. Although Buddha recognized the caste system, his teaching\nremoved its worst features, for Kshatriyas and converted Brahmans could accept\nfood from the Sudras without fear of contamination. Kings embraced the new\nreligion, which ultimately assumed a national character.\n\nMissionaries were from the earliest times sent abroad, and Buddhism spread\ninto Burma, Siam, Anam, Tibet, Mongolia, China, Java, and Japan. The view is\nsuggested that its influence can be traced in Egypt. "From some source,"\nwrites Professor Flinders Petrie, "perhaps the Buddhist mission of Asoka, the\nascetic life of recluses was established in the Ptolemaic times, and monks of\nthe Serapeum illustrated an ideal to man which had been as yet unknown in the\nWest. This system of monasticism continued until Pachomios, a monk of Serapis\nin Upper Egypt, became the first Christian monk in the reign of Constantine."\n1\n\nJainism, like Buddhism, was also a revolt against Brahmanic orthodoxy, and\ndrew its teachers and disciples chiefly from the aristocratic class. It was\nsimilarly influenced in its origin by the _Upanishads_. Jainites believe,\nhowever, in soul and the world soul; they recognize the Hindu deities, but\nonly as exalted souls in a state of temporary bliss achieved by their virtues;\nthey also worship a number of "conquerors" or "openers of the way",\n\np. 134\n\nas Buddhism, in debased form, recognizes Buddha and his disciples as gods, and\nallows the worship here of a tooth and there of a hair of the Enlightener, as\nwell as sacred mounds connected with his pilgrimages. In the gloomy creed of\nthe Jainites it is taught that "emancipation" may be hastened by rigid\nausterities which entail systematic starvation. Many Jainites have in their\nholy places given up their lives in this manner, but the practice is now\nobsolete.\n\nIn the Age which witnessed the decline of Buddhism in India, and the rise of\nreformed Brahmanism, the religious struggle was productive of the long poems\ncalled the _Puranas_ (old tales) to which we have referred. In these\nproductions some of the ancient myths about the  gods were preserved and new\nmyths were formulated. They were meant for popular instruction, and especially\nto make converts among the unlettered masses. Their authors were chiefly of\nthe Vishnu cult, which had perpetuated the teachings of the unknown sages who\nat the close of the Brahmanical Age revolted against impersonal Pantheism, the\nritualistic practices of the priesthood, and the popular conceptions regarding\nthe Vedic deities who ensured worldly prosperity, but exercised little\ninfluence on the character of the individual.\n\nIndra and Agni and other popular deities were not, however, excluded from the\nPantheon, but were divested of their ancient splendour and shown to be subject\nto the sway of Brahma, their Lord and Creator, whose attributes they\nsymbolized in their various spheres of activity. Vishnuites taught that Vishnu\nwas Brahma, and Shivaites that Shiva was the supreme deity.\n\nIn this way, it would appear, the authors of the _Puranas_ effected a\ncompromise between immemorial beliefs and practices and the higher religious\nconceptions\n\np. 135\n\ntowards which the people were being gradually elevated. A similar policy was\nadopted by Pope Gregory the Great, who in the year 601 caused the Archbishop\nof Canterbury to be instructed to infuse Pagan ceremonials with Christian\nsymbolism. It was decreed that heathen temples should be changed into\nchurches, and days consecrated to sacrificial ceremonies to be observed as\nChristian festivals. The Anglo-Saxons were not to be permitted to "sacrifice\nanimals to the Devil", but to kill them for human consumption "to the praise\nof God", so that "while they retained some outward joys they might give more\nready response to inward joys". The Pope added: "It is not possible to cut off\neverything at once from obdurate minds; he who endeavours to climb to the\nhighest place must rise not by bounds, but by degrees or steps." 1\n\nIt is necessary for us, therefore, in dealing with Puranic beliefs, and the\nmovement which culminated in modern-day Hinduism, to make a distinction\nbetween the popular faith and the beliefs of the most enlightened Brahmans,\nand also between the process of mythology-making and the development of\nreligious ideas.\n\nIn early Puranic times, when Brahmanism was revived, Vishnu\'s benevolent\ncharacter was exalted to so high a degree that, it was taught, even demons\nmight secure salvation through his grace. Prahlada, son of the King of the\nDanavas, worshipped Vishnu. As a consequence, terrible punishments were\ninflicted upon him by his angry father. At length Vishnu appeared in the\nDanava palace as the Nrisinha incarnation (half man, half lion), and slew the\npresumptuous giant king who had aspired to control the Universe.\n\nAnother incarnation of Vishnu was the boar, Varaha. A demon named Hiranyaksha\nhad claimed the earth,\n\np. 136\n\nwhen at the beginning of one of the Yugas it was raised from the primordial\ndeep by the Creator in the form of a boar. Vishnu slew the demon for the\nbenefit of the human race. Earlier forms of this myth recognize Brahma, or\nPrajapati, as the boar. In _Taittiriya Brahmana_ it is set forth: "This\nUniverse was formerly water, fluid; with that (water) Prajapati practised\narduous devotions (saying), \'How shall this universe be (developed)?\' He\nbeheld a lotus leaf standing. He thought, \'There is something on which this\nrests.\' He as a boar--having assumed that form--plunged beneath towards it. He\nfound the earth down below. Breaking off (a portion of) her, he rose to the\nsurface."\n\nThis treatment of the boar is of special interest. In Egypt the boar was the\ndemon Set, and the "black pig" is the devil in Wales and Scotland, and also in\na "layer" of Irish mythology. Hatred of pork prevailed in Egypt and its\nvicinity, and still lingers in parts of Ireland and Wales, but especially in\nthe Scottish Highlands. The Gauls, like the Aryans of India, did not regard\nthe boar as a demon, and they ate pork freely, as did also the Achaeans and\nthe Germanic peoples. Roast pig is provided in Valhal and in the Irish Danann\nParadise, but the Irish "devil", Balor, who resembles the Asura king of India,\nhad a herd of black pigs.\n\nThe struggle between Kshatriyas and Brahmans is reflected in Vishnu\'s\nincarnation as Parasu-rama (Rama with the axe). He clears the earth twenty-one\ntimes of the visible Kshatriyas, but on each occasion a few survive to\nperpetuate the caste.\n\nJagannath 1 is also regarded as a form of Vishnu, although apparently not of\nBrahmanic origin. He is represented by three forms, representing the dark\nKrishna,\n\n\n\n[![THE BOAR INCARNATION OF VISHNU RAISING THE EARTH FROM THE DEEP<br> <i>From\na rock sculpture at Udayagiri</i>](tn/13600.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/13600.jpg)  \nTHE BOAR INCARNATION OF VISHNU RAISING THE EARTH FROM THE DEEP  \n_From a rock sculpture at Udayagiri_  \n\n\n\np. 137\n\nthe fair Balarama, and their sister, Subhadra. Once a year the idol is bathed\nand afterwards taken forth in a great car, which is dragged by pious\nworshippers. Some have considered it a meritorious act to commit suicide by\nbeing crushed under its wheels.\n\nIt is believed that Vishnu will yet appear as Kalki, riding on a white horse\nand grasping a flaming sword. He will slay the enemies of evil and re-\nestablish pure religion. Many pious Vishnuites in our own day look forward to\nthe coming of their supreme deity with fear and trembling, but not without\ninflexible faith.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[122:1](iml12.htm#fr_165) A History of Sanskrit Literature, p. 411.\n\n[123:1](iml12.htm#fr_166) _Rigveda_ , i, 154, 155.\n\n[123:2](iml12.htm#fr_167) _Hinduism_ , by L.
