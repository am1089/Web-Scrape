Prayer to appease Arati, the demon of grudge and avarice.\n\n1\\. Bring (wealth) to us, do not stand in our way, O Arati; do not keep from\nus the sacrificial reward as it is being taken (to us)! Adoration be to the\npower of grudge, the power of failure, adoration to Arati!  \n2\\. To thy advising minister, whom thou, Arati, didst make thy agent, do we\nmake obeisance. Do not bring failure to my wish!  \n3\\. May our wish, instilled by the gods, be fulfilled by day and night! We go\nin quest of Arati. Adoration be to Arati!  \n4\\. Sarasvati (speech), Anumati (favour), and Bhaga (fortune) we go to invoke.\nPleasant, honied, words I have spoken on the occasions when the gods were\ninvoked.  \n5\\. Him whom I implore with Vak Sarasvati (the goddess-of speech), the yoke-\nfellow of thought, faith shall find to-day, bestowed by the brown soma!  \n6\\. Neither our wish nor our speech do thou frustrate! May Indra and Agni both\nbring us wealth! Do ye all who to-day desire to make gifts to us gain favour\nwith Arati!  \n7\\. Go far away, failure! Thy missile do we avert. I know thee (to be)\noppressive and piercing, O Arati!  \n8\\. Thou dost even transform thyself into a naked woman, and attach thyself to\npeople in their sleep, frustrating, O Arati, the thought, and intention of\nman.  \n9\\. To her who, great, and of great dimension, did penetrate all the regions,\nto this golden-locked Nirriti (goddess of misfortune), I have rendered\nobeisance.  \n10\\. To the gold-complexioned, lovely one, who rests upon golden cushions, to\nthe great one, to that Arati who wears golden robes, I have rendered\nobeisance.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XII, 4.
