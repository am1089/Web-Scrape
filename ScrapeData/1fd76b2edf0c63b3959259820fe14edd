And also on account of direct statement, and of inference.\n\nThe soul is of atomic size for that reason also that scripture contains a\ndirect statement to that effect, 'By\n\np. 38\n\nthought is to be known that atomic Self into which breath has entered\nfivefold' (Mu. Up. III, 1, 9). That the Self spoken of there as atomic is the\nliving Self, i.e. the individual soul, we see from its connexion with breath.\n--Inference also favours the conclusion that the soul is of atomic size; i.e.\nwe infer that from such passages as 'That living soul is to be known as part\nof the hundredth part of the point of a hair divided a hundred times' ( _S_\nve. Up. V, 9), and, 'That lower one also is seen small even like the point of\na goad.'--But, an objection may here be raised, if the soul is assumed to be\nof atomic size, and therefore to occupy one point of the body only, the fact\nof sensation extending over the whole body would appear contrary to reason.\nAnd yet it is a matter of experience that men bathing in the Ganges or in a\npond experience the sensation of cold over their whole bodies, and again that\nin summer people feel hot all over the body.--To this objection the following\nSutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 23](sbe38024.htm)\n\n"
