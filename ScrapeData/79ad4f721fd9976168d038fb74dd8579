Charm against curses and hostile plots, undertaken with a certain\nplant.\n\n1\\. The god-begotten plant, hated by the wicked, which wipes away the curses\n(of the enemies), like water a foul spot it has washed away all curses from\nme.  \n2\\. The curse of the rival and the curse of the kinswoman, the curse which the\nBrahman shall utter in wrath, all that (do thou put) under our feet!  \n3\\. From heaven her root is suspended, from the earth it rises up; with her\nthat has a thousand shoots do thou protect us on all sides!  \n4\\. Protect me, protect my offspring, protect our goods; let not ill-will\novercome us, let not hostile schemes overcome us!  \n5\\. The curse shall go to the curser; joint possession shall we have with the\nfriend. Of the enemy who bewitches with (his) eye we hew off the ribs.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 6.
