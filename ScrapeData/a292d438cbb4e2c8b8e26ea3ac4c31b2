D. Barnett, [1911], at sacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\n#### XV. Gloria in Excelsis 1\n\nI know that great Spirit, sun-hued, beyond the darkness. Knowing Him, man\nescapeth Death; there is no other way to walk.\n\nThan this naught else is higher, nor subtler,\n\np. 99\n\nnor mightier. As a tree firm-set in the heavens 1 stands the One; with this\nSpirit the universe is filled.\n\nFormless, sorrowless is the Highest; they become deathless who know it; but\nothers come to very grief.\n\nWith face, head, neck everywhere, dwelling in covert in every creature,\npervading all, the Lord is He; thus everywhere is the presence of the\nGracious. 2\n\nA great lord is the Spirit, mover of the understanding, ruler of this pure\napproach, Light, 3 unfading.\n\nThe Spirit dwells ever as inward soul, an inch in stature, within men's\nhearts, conceived by the heart, the imagination, the thought; deathless they\nbecome who know this\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nShowing himself in the qualities of all senses, void of all senses, He is\nlord, ruler of all, refuge of all.\n\nBodied in the nine-gated city, 4 the Swan hovers without, master of all the\nmotionless and moving world. 5\n\nHandless and footless, He speeds and seizes;\n\np. 100\n\neyeless, He sees; earless, He hears. He knows what may be known, but there is\nnone to know Him. Men call Him the Primal, the Great Spirit.\n\nSubtler than the subtle is He, greater than the great, the soul lodged in\ncovert in living beings. Freed from grief, man sees by the Almighty's grace\nHim the desireless, Him the Power sovereign.\n\nI know Him, the ageless, ancient, All-soul, dwelling everywhere in universal\npresence, to whom Brahma-teachers deny birth, whom they call the Eternal.\n\nThe one hue that by blending of powers lends manifold hues in diverse wise\nfrom gathered substance, the Beginning and End wherein the All dissolves--He\nis God; may He unite us with blessed understanding!\n\nThat same is the Fire, that is the Sun, that the Wind, that the Moon; that\nsame is the Bright, that Brahma, that the Waters, that the Creator.\n\nThou art woman, Thou art man, Thou art boy and maiden; Thou art the old man\ntottering on the staff; Thou art born with face looking all ways.\n\nThou art the black bird, the green with red eyes, the lightning-bearing\n[cloud], the seasons, the seas; Thou art that which is beginningless, Thou\nlivest in universal presence, whence are born all beings\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nIn vision of the Lord, the bounteous worshipful\n\np. 101\n\n[paragraph continues] God, who stands sole warder over every womb, in whom\nthis All falls together and dissolves asunder, man comes to this everlasting\npeace.\n\nMay He who is the fount and origin of the gods, the lord of all, Rudra, the\ngreat sage, who beheld the Germ of Gold [1](brk44.htm#fn_72) coming into\nbeing, unite us with blessed understanding\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nWhere there is not darkness, nor day and night, nor being or not-being, but\nthe Gracious One alone, that is the Unfading, that is the lovely [light] of\nSavit\xc4\x81 [2](brk44.htm#fn_73); thence has streamed forth the ancient\nIntelligence.\n\nHe may not be grasped above, nor athwart, nor in the midst. There is no\nlikeness of Him whose name is Great Glory.\n\nHis form is not to be beheld; none sees Him with the eye. Deathless they\nbecome who in heart and mind know Him as heart-dwelling.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[98:1](brk43.htm#fr_66) \xc5\x9avet\xc4\x81\xc5\x9bvatara Upanishad, iii. 8--iv. 20. This work, one\nof the earliest metrical Upanishads, is marked by a singular combination of\nphilosophical idealism with theistic feeling. In it Brahma appears as a living\nGod, especially in his manifestation as \xc5\x9aiva, or Rudra, the spirit of cosmic\ndestruction. Here accordingly we find the first expression of the doctrine of\nDivine Grace and of worship in love, which later became one of the chief\nfeatures in Hindu religion, especially in the Vish\xe1\xb9\x87uite church.\n\n[99:1](brk43.htm#fr_67) Compare Ka\xe1\xb9\xadh. Upan. vi. 1. The universe is compared to\nan _a \xc5\x9bvattha_ tree, the _Ficus religiosa,_ of which the branches are the\nphenomenal world and the root Brahma.\n\n[99:2](brk43.htm#fr_68) _\xc5\x9a iva,_ a title of Rudra which has gradually ousted\nthe, latter name.\n\n[99:3](brk43.htm#fr_69) See extract vii., p. 68.\n\n[99:4](brk43.htm#fr_70) Compare above, p. 61.\n\n[99:5](brk43.htm#fr_71) Compare extract vii., above.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XVI: The Advaita-Makaranda of Lakshmidara](brk44.htm)\n\n"
