But the former, Badaraya _n_ a (thinks), on account of the designation\n(of deities) as the cause.\n\nThe reverend Badaraya _n_ a maintains the previously declared awarding of\nrewards by the Supreme Person since the scriptural texts referring to the\ndifferent sacrifices declare that the deities only, Agni, Vayu, and so on, who\nare propitiated by the sacrifices--which are nothing else but means to\npropitiate deities--are the cause of the rewards attached to the sacrifices.\nCompare texts such as 'Let him who is desirous of prosperity offer a white\nanimal to Vayu. For Vayu is the swiftest god. The man thus approaches Vayu\nwith his proper share, and Vayu leads him to prosperity.' And the whole\ninstruction which the texts give, as to the means by which men desirous of\ncertain results are to effect those results, is required on account of the\ninjunctions only, and hence it cannot be doubted that\n\np. 627\n\nit has reference to the injunctions. The apparatus of means to bring about the\nresults thus being learnt from the text only, no person acquainted with the\nforce of the means of proof will assent to that apparatus, as stated by the\ntext, being set aside and an apurva about which the text says nothing being\nfancifully assumed. And that the imperative verbal forms of the injunctions\ndenote as the thing to be effected by the effort of the sacrificer, only that\nwhich on the basis of the usage of language and grammatical science is\nrecognised as the meaning of the root-element of such words as ' ya _g_ eta,'\nviz. the sacrifice (yaga), which consists in the propitiation of a divine\nbeing, and not some additional supersensuous thing such as the apurva, we have\nalready proved above (p. 153 ff.). Texts such as 'Vayu is the swiftest god'\nteach that Vayu and other deities are the bestowers of rewards. And that it is\nfundamentally the highest Self--as constituting the inner Self of Vayu and\nother deities--which is pleased by offerings, and bestows rewards for them is\ndeclared by texts such as 'Offerings and pious works, all this he bears who is\nthe nave of the Universe. He is Agni and Vayu, he is Sun and Moon' (Mahanar.\nUp. I, 6, 7). Similarly in the antaryamin-brahma _n_ a, 'He who dwells in\nVayu, of whom Vayu is the body'; 'He who dwells in Agni,' &c. Sm _ri_ ti\nexpresses itself similarly, 'Whatsoever devotee wishes to worship with faith\nwhatsoever divine form, of him do I make that faith unshakable. Endued with\nsuch faith he endeavours to propitiate him and obtains from him his desires--\nthose indeed being ordained by me' (Bha. Gi. VII, 21-22); 'For I am the\nenjoyer and the Lord of all sacrifices' (IX, 24)--where Lord means him who\nbestows the reward for the sacrifices. 'To the gods go the worshippers of the\ngods, and those devoted to me go to me' (VII, 23). In ordinary life men, by\nagriculture and the like, acquire wealth in various forms, and by means of\nthis propitiate their king, either directly or through his officials and\nservants; and the king thereupon is seen to reward them in a manner\ncorresponding to the measure of their services and presents. The Vedanta-\ntexts, on the other hand, give\n\np. 628\n\ninstruction on a subject which transcends the sphere of all the other means of\nknowledge, viz. the highest Person who is free from all shadow even of\nimperfection, and a treasure-house as it were of all exalted qualities in\ntheir highest state of perfection; on sacrifices, gifts, oblations, which are\nhelpful towards the propitiation of that Person; on praise, worship, and\nmeditation, which directly propitiate him; and on the rewards which he, thus\npropitiated, bestows, viz. temporal happiness and final Release.--Here\nterminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'reward.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Third Pada: 1.
