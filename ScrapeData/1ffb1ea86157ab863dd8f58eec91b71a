Agni, the Hot _ri_ , he who is a strong horse, is led around at our\nsacrifice, the god worshipful among the gods.\n\n2\\. Agni goes thrice [1](sbe46104.htm#an_4:15:2:1) around the sacrifice, like\na charioteer, conveying the enjoyment [2](sbe46104.htm#an_4:15:2:2) to the\ngods.\n\n3\\. Agni, the lord of booty, the sage, has circumambulated the oblations,\nbestowing treasures on the worshipper.\n\n\n\n4\\. This (is the Agni) who is kindled in the front for Devavata's son, the S\n_ri_ _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ aya [1](sbe46104.htm#an_4:15:4:1), the brilliant (god), the\ndeceiver of foes.\n\n5\\. May the strong mortal be the master of this (god), of an Agni like this,\nwith sharp teeth and bountiful.\n\n6 [1](sbe46104.htm#an_4:15:6:1). Him they clean day by day like a racer that\nwins (booty), like (Soma), the red young child of Heaven\n[2](sbe46104.htm#an_4:15:6:2).\n\n7\\. When Sahadeva's son, the prince, thought of me with two bay horses\n[1](sbe46104.htm#an_4:15:7:1), I rose up like one who is called.\n\n8\\. And immediately I accepted from Sahadeva's son, the prince, those adorable\ntwo bay horses which he offered me.\n\n9\\. May this prince Somaka, Sahadeva's son, live long, for your sake, O divine\nA _s_ vins!\n\n10\\. Give long life, O divine A _s_ vins, to this son of Sahadeva, the prince!\n\np. 361\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi. Metre, Gayatri.--Verses 1-3 = TB. III, 6, 4, 1; MS. IV, 13,\n4. Verse 3 = SV. I, 30; VS. XI, 25; TS. IV, 1, 2, 5; MS. I, 1, 9.\n\nThe first three verses are characterised by the constant allusions to Agni's\nbeing carried around, and, in connection therewith, by the frequent repetition\nof the preposition pari. Probably these verses formed an independent T _ri_\n_k_ a-hymn, the position of which would be according to the laws of\narrangement of the Sa _m_ hita; this T _ri_ _k_ a seems, consequently, to\nbelong to the original collection of hymns. The verses 4-10, on the other\nhand, or at least the verses 7-10, would seem to be a later addition; the\nverses 4-6 can be considered as a T _ri_ _k_ a belonging to the original Sa\n_m_ hita, though in this case it is difficult to explain why the verses 7-10,\nwhich do not contain any reference to Agni, have been inserted here at the end\nof the series of Agni hymns. Another argument against the separation of the\nverses 4-6 from the rest of the Sukta is the mention of the prince S _ri_ _\xc3\xb1_\n_g_ aya in verse 4: verses 7-10 refer to a prince Somaka Sahadevya, and we\nknow from the Aitareya Brahma _n_ a (VII, 34, cf. _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a\nII, 4, 4, 4) that this prince also belonged to the S _ri_ _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ aya tribe.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Cf. above, IV, 6, 4.\n\nNote 2. I. e. the offering which the gods enjoy.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. This S _ri_ _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ aya Daivavata is mentioned also in VI, 27, 7.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. The first Pada of this verse is identical with the first Pada of VIII,\n102, 12.\n\np. 362\n\nNote 2. The red young child of Heaven seems to be the Soma. The Soma\nfrequently is called arusha ('red'), and is said to be cleansed by men; in IX,\n33, 5; 38, 5, the expression diva _h_ _s_ i _s_ u _h_ ('the young child of\nHeaven') is used with regard to him.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. I. e. when he thought of presenting me with the two horses.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 1](sbe46105.htm)\n\n"
