The Self consisting of Bliss (is the highest Self) on account of\nmultiplication.\n\nWe read in the text of the Taittiriyas, 'Different from this Self, which\nconsists of Understanding, is the other inner Self which consists of bliss'\n(Taitt. Up. II, 5).--Here the doubt arises whether the Self consisting of\nbliss be the highest Self, which is different from the inner Self subject to\nbondage and release, and termed ' _g_ iva.' (i.e. living self or individual\nsoul), or whether it be that very inner Self, i.e. the _g_ iva.--It _is_ that\ninner Self, the Purvapakshin contends. For the text says 'of that this, i.e.\nthe Self consisting of bliss, is the _s_ arira Self'; and _s_ arira means that\nwhich is joined to a body, in other words, the so-called _g_ iva.--But, an\nobjection is raised, the text enumerates the different Selfs, beginning with\nthe Self consisting of bliss, to the end that man may obtain the bliss of\nBrahman, which was, at the outset, stated to be the cause of the world (II,\n1), and in the end teaches that the Self consisting of bliss is the cause of\nthe world (II, 6). And that the cause of the world is the all-knowing Lord,\nsince Scripture says of him that 'he thought,' we have already explained.--\nThat cause of the world, the Purvapakshin rejoins, is not different from the\n_g_ iva; for in the text of the _Kh_ andogyas that Being which first is\ndescribed as the creator of the world is exhibited, in two passages, in co-\nordination with the _g_ iva ('having entered into them with that living Self'\nand 'Thou art that, O _S_ vetaketu'). And the purport of co-ordination is to\nexpress oneness of being, as when we say, 'This person here is that Devadatta\nwe knew before.' And creation preceded by thought can very well be ascribed to\nan intelligent _g_ iva. The connexion of the whole Taittiriya-text then is as\nfollows. In the introductory clause, 'He who knows Brahman attains the\n\np. 210\n\n[paragraph continues] Highest,' the true nature of the _g_ iva, free from all\nconnexion with matter, is referred to as something to be attained; and of this\nnature a definition is given in the words, 'The True, knowledge, the Infinite\nis Brahman.' The attainment of the _g_ iva in this form is what constitutes\nRelease, in agreement with the text, 'So long as he is in the body he cannot\nget free from pleasure and pain; but when he is free from the body then\nneither pleasure nor pain touches him' ( _Kh._ Up. VIII, 12, 1). This true\nnature of the Self, free from all avidya, which the text begins by presenting\nas an object to be attained, is thereupon declared to be the Self consisting\nof bliss. In order to lead up to this--just as a man points out to another the\nmoon by first pointing out the branch of a tree near which the moon is to be\nseen--the text at first refers to the body ('Man consists of food'); next to\nthe vital breath with its five modifications which is within the body and\nsupports it; then to the manas within the vital breath; then to the buddhi\nwithin the manas--'the Self consisting of breath'; 'the Self consisting of\nmind' (manas); 'the Self consisting of understanding' (vi _g \xc3\xb1_ana). Having\nthus gradually led up to the _g_ iva, the text finally points out the latter,\nwhich is the innermost of all ('Different from that is the inner Self which\nconsists of bliss'), and thus completes the series of Selfs one inside the\nother. We hence conclude that the Self consisting of bliss is that same _g_\niva-self which was at the outset pointed out as the Brahman to be attained.--\nBut the clause immediately following, 'Brahman is the tail, the support (of\nthe Self of bliss'), indicates that Brahman is something different from the\nSelf of bliss!--By no means (the Purvapakshin rejoins). Brahman is, owing to\nits different characteristics, there compared to an animal body, and head,\nwings, and tail are ascribed to it, just as in a preceding clause the body\nconsisting of food had also been imagined as having head, wings, and tail--\nthese members not being something different from the body, but the body\nitself. Joy, satisfaction, great satisfaction, bliss, are imagined as the\nmembers, non-different from it, of Brahman consisting of bliss, and of them\nall the unmixed bliss-constituted\n\np. 211\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahman is said to be the tail or support. If Brahman\nwere something different from the Self consisting of bliss, the text would\nhave continued, 'Different from this Self consisting of bliss is the other\ninner Self--Brahman.' But there is no such continuation. The connexion of the\ndifferent clauses stands as follows: After Brahman has been introduced as the\ntopic of the section ('He who knows Brahman attains the Highest'), and defined\nas different in nature from everything else ('The True, knowledge'), the text\ndesignates it by the term 'Self,' &c. ('From that Self sprang ether'), and\nthen, in order to make it clear that Brahman is the innermost Self of all,\nenumerates the pra _n_ amaya and so on--designating them in succession as more\nand more inward Selfs--, and finally leads up to the anandamaya as the\ninnermost Self('Different from this,&c., is the Self consisting of bliss').\nFrom all which it appears that the term 'Self' up to the end denotes the\nBrahman mentioned at the beginning.--But, in immediate continuation of the\nclause, 'Brahman is the tail, the support,' the text exhibits the following\n_s_ loka: 'Non-existing becomes he who views Brahman as non-existing; who\nknows Brahman as existing, him we know as himself existing.' Here the\nexistence and non-existence of the Self are declared to depend on the\nknowledge and non-knowledge of Brahman, not of the Self consisting of bliss.\nNow no doubt can possibly arise as to the existence or non-existence of this\nlatter Self, which, in the form of joy, satisfaction, &c., is known to every\none. Hence the _s_ loka cannot refer to that Self, and hence Brahman is\ndifferent from that Self.--This objection, the Purvapakshin rejoins, is\nunfounded. In the earlier parts of the chapter we have corresponding _s_\nlokas, each of them following on a preceding clause that refers to the tail or\nsupport of a particular Self: in the case, e.g. of the Self consisting of\nfood, we read, 'This is the tail, the support,' and then comes the _s_ loka,\n'From food are produced all creatures,' &c. Now it is evident that all these\n_s_ lokas are meant to set forth not only what had been called 'tail,' but the\nentire Self concerned (Self of food, Self of breath, &c.); and from this it\nfollows that also the _s_ loka, 'Non-existing becomes\n\np. 212\n\nhe,' does not refer to the 'tail' only as something other than the Self of\nbliss, but to the entire Self of bliss. And there may very well be a doubt\nwith regard to the knowledge or non-knowledge of the existence of that Self\nconsisting of unlimited bliss. On your view also the circumstance of Brahman\nwhich forms the tail not being known is due to its being of the nature of\nlimitless bliss. And should it be said that the Self of bliss cannot be\nBrahman because Brahman does not possess a head and other members; the answer\nis that Brahman also does not possess the quality of being a tail or support,\nand that hence Brahman cannot be a tail.--Let it then be said that the\nexpression, 'Brahman is the tail,' is merely figurative, in so far as Brahman\nis the substrate of all things imagined through avidya!--But, the Purvapakshin\nrejoins, we may as well assume that the ascription to Brahman of joy, as its\nhead and so on, is also merely figurative, meant to illustrate the nature of\nBrahman, i.e. the Self of bliss as free from all pain. To speak of Brahman or\nthe Self as consisting of bliss has thus the purpose of separating from all\npain and grief that which in a preceding clause ('The True, knowledge, the\nInfinite is Brahman') had already been separated from all changeful material\nthings. As applied to Brahman (or the Self), whose nature is nothing but\nabsolute bliss, the term 'anandamaya' therefore has to be interpreted as\nmeaning nothing more than 'ananda'; just as pra _n_ amaya means pra _n_ a.\n\nThe outcome of all this is that the term 'anandamaya' denotes the true\nessential nature--which is nothing but absolute uniform bliss--of the _g_ iva\nthat appears as distinguished by all the manifold individualising forms which\nare the figments of Nescience. The Self of bliss is the _g_ iva or pratyag-\natman, i.e. the individual soul.\n\nAgainst this prima facie view the Sutrakara contends that the Self consisting\nof bliss is the highest Self 'on account of multiplication.'--The section\nwhich begins with the words,'This is an examination of bliss,' and terminates\nwith the _s_ loka, 'from whence all speech turns back' (Taitt. Up. II, 8),\narrives at bliss, supreme and not to be surpassed, by successively multiplying\ninferior stages of bliss by a\n\np. 213\n\nhundred; now such supreme bliss cannot possibly belong to the individual soul\nwhich enjoys only a small share of very limited happiness, mixed with endless\npain and grief; and therefore clearly indicates, as its abode, the highest\nSelf, which differs from all other Selfs in so far as being radically opposed\nto all evil and of an unmixed blessed nature. The text says, 'Different from\nthis Self consisting of understanding (vi _g \xc3\xb1_ana) there is the inner Self\nconsisting of bliss'. Now that which consists of understanding (vi _g \xc3\xb1_ana)\nis the individual soul ( _g_ iva), not the internal organ (buddhi) only; for\nthe formative element, 'maya,' ('consisting of'; in vi _g \xc3\xb1_anamaya) indicates\na difference (between vi _g \xc3\xb1_ana and vi _g \xc3\xb1_anamaya). The term 'pra _n_\na-maya' ('consisting of breath ') we explain to mean 'pra _n_ a' only, because\nno other explanation is possible; but as vi _g \xc3\xb1_anamaya may be explained\nas,-- _g_ iva, we have no right to neglect 'maya' as unmeaning. And this\ninterpretation is quite suitable, as the soul in the states of bondage and\nrelease alike is a 'knowing' subject. That moreover even in 'pra _n_ amaya',\nand so on, the affix 'maya' may be taken as having a meaning will be shown\nfurther on.--But how is it then that in the _s_ loka which refers to the vi _g\n\xc3\xb1_anamaya, 'Understanding (vi _g \xc3\xb1_ana) performs the sacrifice', the term 'vi\n_g \xc3\xb1_ana' only is used?--The essential nature, we reply, of the knowing\nsubject is suitably called 'knowledge', and this term is transferred to the\nknowing subject itself which is defined as possessing that nature. For we\ngenerally see that words which denote attributes defining the essential nature\nof a thing also convey the notion of the essential nature of the thing itself.\nThis also accounts for the fact that the _s_ loka ('Vi _g \xc3\xb1_ana performs the\nsacrifice, it performs all sacred acts') speaks of vi _g \xc3\xb1_ana as being the\nagent in sacrifices and so on; the buddhi alone could not be called an agent.\nFor this reason the text does not ascribe agency to the other Selfs (the pra\n_n_ amaya and so on) which are mentioned before the vi _g \xc3\xb1_anamaya; for they\nare non-intelligent instruments of intelligence, and the latter only can be an\nagent. With the same view the text further on (II, 6), distinguishing the\nintelligent and the non-intelligent\n\np. 214\n\nby means of their different characteristic attributes, says in the end\n'knowledge and non-knowledge,' meaning thereby that which possesses the\nattribute of knowledge and that which does not. An analogous case is met with\nin the so-called antaryami-brahma _n_ a (B _ri_. Up. III. 7). There the Ka _n_\nvas read, 'He who dwells in knowledge' (vi _g \xc3\xb1_ana; III, 7, 16), but instead\nof this the Madhyandinas read 'he who dwells in the Self,' and so make clear\nthat what the Ka _n_ vas designate as 'knowledge' really is the knowing Self.\n--That the word vi _g \xc3\xb1_ana, although denoting the knowing Self, yet has a\nneuter termination, is meant to denote it as something substantial. We hence\nconclude that he who is different from the Self consisting of knowledge, i.e.\nthe individual Self, is the highest Self which consists of bliss.\n\nIt is true indeed that the _s_ loka, 'Knowledge performs the sacrifice,\n'directly mentions knowledge only, not the knowing Self; all the same we have\nto understand that what is meant is the latter, who is referred to in the\nclause, 'different from this is the inner Self which consists of knowledge.'\nThis conclusion is supported by the _s_ loka referring to the Self which\nconsists of food (II, 2); for that _s_ loka refers to food only, 'From food\nare produced all creatures,' &c., all the same the preceding clause 'this man\nconsists of the essence of food' does not refer to food, but to an effect of\nit which consists of food. Considering all this the Sutrakara himself in a\nsubsequent Sutra (I, 1, 18) bases his view on the declaration, in the\nscriptural text, of difference.--We now turn to the assertion, made by the\nPurvapakshin, that the cause of the world is not different from the individual\nsoul because in two _Kh_ andogya passages it is exhibited in co-ordination\nwith the latter ('having entered into them with this living Self,' 'Thou art\nthat'); and that hence the introductory clause of the Taitt. passage ('He who\nknows Brahman reaches the Highest') refers to the individual soul--which\nfurther on is called 'consisting of bliss,' because it is free from all that\nis not pleasure.--This view cannot be upheld; for although the individual soul\nis intelligent, it is incapable of producing through its volition this\ninfinite and wonderful Universe--a process described in texts such\n\np. 215\n\nas 'It thought, may I be many, may I grow forth.--It sent forth fire,' &c.\nThat even the released soul is unequal to such 'world business' as creation,\ntwo later Sutras will expressly declare. But, if you deny that Brahman, the\ncause of the world, is identical with the individual soul, how then do you\naccount for the co-ordination in which the two appear in the _Kh_ andogya\ntexts?--How, we ask in return, can Brahman, the cause of all, free from all\nshadow of imperfection, omniscient, omnipotent, &c. &c., be one with the\nindividual soul, all whose activities--whether it be thinking, or winking of\nan eye, or anything else--depend on karman, which implies endless suffering of\nvarious kind?--If you reply that this is possible if one of two things is\nunreal, we ask--which then do you mean to be unreal? Brahman's connexion with\nwhat is evil?--or its essential nature, owing to which it is absolutely good\nand antagonistic to all evil?--You will perhaps reply that, owing to the fact\nof Brahman, which is absolutely good and antagonistic to all evil, being the\nsubstrate of beginningless Nescience, there presents itself the false\nappearance of its being connected with evil. But there you maintain what is\ncontradictory. On the one side there is Brahman's absolute perfection and\nantagonism to all evil; on the other it is the substrate of Nescience, and\nthereby the substrate of a false appearance which is involved in endless pain;\nfor to be connected with evil means to be the substrate of Nescience and the\nappearance of suffering which is produced thereby. Now it is a contradiction\nto say that Brahman is connected with all this and at the same time\nantagonistic to it!--Nor can we allow you to say that there is no real\ncontradiction because that appearance is something false. For whatever is\nfalse belongs to that group of things contrary to man's true interest, for the\ndestruction of which the Vedanta-texts are studied. To be connected with what\nis hurtful to man, and to be absolutely perfect and antagonistic to all evil\nis self-contradictory.--But, our adversary now rejoins, what after all are we\nto do? The holy text at first clearly promises that through the cognition of\none thing everything will be known ('by which that which is\n\np. 216\n\nnot heard _is_ heard,' &c., _Kh_. Up. VI, 1, 3); thereupon declares that\nBrahman is the sole cause of the world ('Being only this was in the\nbeginning'), and possesses exalted qualities such as the power of realising\nits intentions ('it thought, may I be many'); and then finally, by means of\nthe co-ordination, 'Thou art that' intimates that Brahman is one with the\nindividual soul, which we know to be subject to endless suffering! Nothing\ntherefore is left to us but the hypothesis that Brahman is the substrate of\nNescience and all that springs from it!--Not even for the purpose, we reply,\nof making sense of Scripture may we assume what in itself is senseless and\ncontradictory!--Let us then say that Brahman's connexion with evil is real,\nand its absolute perfection unreal!--Scripture, we reply, aims at comforting\nthe soul afflicted by the assaults of threefold pain, and now, according to\nyou, it teaches that the assaults of suffering are real, while its essential\nperfection and happiness are unreal figments, due to error! This is excellent\ncomfort indeed!--To avoid these difficulties let us then assume that both\naspects of Brahman--viz. on the one hand its entering into the distressful\ncondition of individual souls other than non-differenced intelligence, and on\nthe other its being the cause of the world, endowed with all perfections, &c.\n--are alike unreal!--Well, we reply, we do not exactly admire the depth of\nyour insight into the connected meaning of texts. The promise that through the\nknowledge of one thing everything will be known can certainly not be fulfilled\nif everything is false, for in that case there exists nothing that could be\nknown. In so far as the cognition of one thing has something real for its\nobject, and the cognition of all things is of the same kind, and moreover is\ncomprised in the cognition of one thing; in so far it can be said that\neverything is known through one thing being known. Through the cognition of\nthe real shell we do not cognise the unreal silver of which the shell is the\nsubstrate.--Well, our adversary resumes, let it then be said that the meaning\nof the declaration that through the cognition of one thing everything is to be\nknown is that only non-differenced Being is real, while everything\n\np. 217\n\nelse is unreal.--If this were so, we rejoin, the text would not say, 'by which\nthe non-heard is heard, the non-known is known'; for the meaning of this is,\n'by which when heard and known' ( _not_ 'known as false') 'the non-heard is\nheard,' &c. Moreover, if the meaning were that only the one non-differenced\nsubstance understood to be the cause of the world is real, the illustrative\ninstance, 'As by one lump of clay everything made of clay is known,' would not\nbe suitable; for what is meant there is that through the cognition of the\n(real) lump of clay its (real) effects are known. Nor must 'you say that in\nthe illustrative instance also the unreality of the effect is set forth; for\nas the person to be informed is not in any way convinced at the outset that\nthings made of clay are unreal, like the snake imagined in the rope, it is\nimpossible that such unreality should be referred to as if it were something\nwell known (and the clause, 'as by one lump of clay,' &c., undoubtedly _does_\nrefer to something well known), in order to render the initial assertion\nplausible. And we are not aware of any means of knowledge--assisted or non-\nassisted by ratiocination--that would prove the non-reality of things\neffected, previous to the cognition produced by texts such as 'That art thou';\na point which will be discussed at length under II, 1.--'Being only this was\nin the beginning, one, without a second'; 'it thought, may I be many, may I\ngrow forth; it sent forth fire'; 'Let me now enter those three beings with\nthis living Self and evolve names and forms'; 'All these creatures, my son,\nhave their root in the True, they dwell in the True, they rest in the True,'\n&c.; these passages declare in succession that that which really is is the\nSelf of this world; that previous to creation there is no distinction of names\nand forms; that for the creation of the world Brahman, termed 'the True' (or\n'Real'), requires no other operative cause but itself; that at the time of\ncreation it forms a resolution, possible to itself only, of making itself\nmanifold in the form of endless movable and immovable things; that in\naccordance with this resolution there takes place a creation, proceeding in a\nparticular order, of an infinite number of manifold\n\np. 218\n\nbeings; that by Brahman entering into all non-intelligent beings with the\nliving soul--which has its Self in Brahman--there takes place an evolution,\ninfinite in extent, of all their particular names and forms; and that\neverything different from Brahman has its root and abode in that, is moved by\nthat, lives by that, rests on that. All the different points--to be learned\nfrom Scripture only--which are here set forth agree with what numerous other\nscriptural texts teach about Brahman, viz. that it is free from all evil,\ndevoid of all imperfection, all-knowing, all-powerful; that all its wishes and\npurposes realise themselves; that it is the cause of all bliss; that it enjoys\nbliss not to be surpassed. To maintain then that the word 'that,' which refers\nback to the Brahman mentioned before, i.e. a Brahman possessing infinite\nattributes, should aim at conveying instruction about a substance devoid of\nall attributes, is as unmeaning as the incoherent talk of a madman.\n\nThe word 'thou' again denotes the individual soul as distinguished by its\nimplication in the course of transmigratory existence, and the proper sense of\nthis term also would have to be abandoned if it were meant to suggest a\nsubstance devoid of all distinctions. And that, in the case of a being\nconsisting of non-differenced light, obscuration by Nescience would be\ntantamount to complete destruction, we have already explained above.--All this\nbeing thus, your interpretation would involve that the proper meaning of the\ntwo words 'that' and 'thou'--which refer to one thing--would have to be\nabandoned, and both words would have to be taken in an implied sense only.\n\nAgainst this the Purvapakshin now may argue as follows. Several words which\nare applied to one thing are meant to express one sense, and as this is not\npossible in so far as the words connote different attributes, this part of\ntheir connotation becomes inoperative, and they denote only the unity of one\nsubstance; implication (laksha _n_ a), therefore, does not take place. When we\nsay 'blue (is) (the) lotus' we employ two words with the intention of\nexpressing the unity of one thing, and hence do not aim at expressing a\nduality of attributes, viz. the quality of blueness and the\n\np. 219\n\ngeneric character of a lotus. If this latter point was aimed at, it would\nfollow that the sentence would convey the oneness of the two aspects of the\nthing, viz. its being blue and its being a lotus; but this is not possible,\nfor the thing (denoted by the two terms) is not characterised by (the\ndenotation of) the word 'lotus,' in so far as itself characterised by\nblueness; for this would imply a reciprocal inherence (samavaya) of class-\ncharacteristics and quality 1. What the co-ordination of the two words conveys\nis, therefore, only the oneness of a substance characterised by the quality of\nblueness, and at the same time by the class attributes of a lotus. In the same\nway, when we say 'this (person is) that Devadatta' the co-ordination of the\nwords cannot possibly mean that Devadatta in so far as distinguished by his\nconnexion with a past time and a distant place is one with Devadatta in so far\nas distinguished by his connexion with the present time and a near place; what\nit means to express is only that there is oneness on the part of a personal\nsubstance--which substance is characterised by connexion with both places and\nmoments of time. It is true indeed that when we at first hear the one word\n'blue' we form the idea of the attribute of blueness, while, after having\napprehended the relation of co-ordination (expressed in 'blue is the lotus'),\nthis idea no longer presents itself, for this would imply a contradiction; but\nall the same 'implication' does not take place. The essence of co-ordination\nconsists, in all cases, therein that it suppresses the distinguishing elements\nin the words co-ordinated. And as thus our explanation cannot be charged with\n'implication,' it cannot be objected to.\n\nAll this, we rejoin, is unfounded. What the words in all sentences whatsoever\naim at conveying is only a particular connexion of the things known to be\ndenoted by those words. Words such as 'blue,' standing in co-ordination with\nothers, express that some matter possessing the attribute\n\np. 220\n\nof blueness, &c., as known from the ordinary use of language, is connected\nwith some other matter. When, e.g., somebody says 'bring the blue lotus,' a\nthing is brought which possesses the attribute of blueness. And when we are\ntold that 'a herd of elephants excited with passion lives in the Vindhya-\nforest,' we again understand that what is meant is something possessing\nseveral attributes denoted by several words. Analogously we have to\nunderstand, as the thing intimated by Vedanta-texts in the form of\ncoordination, Brahman as possessing such and such attributes.--It is an error\nto assume that, where a sentence aims at setting forth attributes, one\nattribute is to be taken as qualifying the thing in so far as qualified by\nanother attribute; the case rather is that the thing itself is equally\nqualified by all attributes. For co-ordination means the application, to one\nthing, of several words having different reasons of application; and the\neffect of co-ordination is that one and the same thing, because being\nconnected--positively or negatively--with some attribute other than that which\nis conveyed by one word, is also known through other words. As e.g. when it is\nsaid that 'Devadatta (is) dark-complexioned, young, reddish-eyed, not stupid,\nnot poor, of irreproachable character.' Where two co-ordinate words express\ntwo attributes which cannot exist combined in one thing, one of the two words\nis to be taken in a secondary sense, while the other retains its primary\nmeaning, as e.g. in the case of the sentence, 'The Vahika man is an ox.' But\nin the case of the 'blue lotus' and the like, where there is nothing\ncontradictory in the connexion of the two attributes with one thing, co-\nordination expresses the fact of one thing being characterised by two\nattributes.--Possibly our opponent will here make the following remark. A\nthing in so far as defined by its correlation to some one attribute is\nsomething different from the thing in so far as defined by its correlation to\nsome second attribute; hence, even if there is equality of case affixes (as in\n'nilam utpalam'), the words co-ordinated are incapable of expressing oneness,\nand cannot, therefore, express the oneness of a thing qualified by several\nattributes; not any\n\np. 221\n\nmore than the juxtaposition of two words such as 'jar' and 'cloth'--both\nhaving the same case-ending--can prove that these two things are one. A\nstatement of co-ordination, therefore, rather aims at expressing the oneness\nof a thing in that way that it presents to the mind the essential nature of\nthe thing by means of (words denoting) its attributes.--This would be so, we\nreply, if it were only the fact of a thing's standing in correlation to two\nattributes that is in the way of its unity. But this is not the case; for what\nstands in the way of such unity is the fact of there being several attributes\nwhich are not capable of being combined in one thing. Such incapability is, in\nthe case of the generic character of a jar and that of a piece of cloth,\nproved by other means of knowledge; but there is no contradiction between a\nthing being blue and its being a lotus; not any more than there is between a\nman and the stick or the earrings he wears, or than there is between the\ncolour, taste, smell, &c., of one and the same thing. Not only is there no\ncontradiction, but it is this very fact of one thing possessing two attributes\nwhich makes possible co-ordination--the essence of which is that, owing to a\ndifference of causes of application, several words express one and the same\nthing. For if there were nothing but essential unity of being, what reason\nwould there be for the employment of several words? If the purport of the\nattributes were, not to intimate their connexion with the thing, but merely to\nsuggest the thing itself, one attribute would suffice for such suggestion, and\nanything further would be meaningless. If, on the other hand, it were assumed\nthat the use of a further 'suggestive' attribute is to bring out a difference\nof aspect in the thing suggested, such difference of aspect would imply\ndifferentiation in the thing (which you maintain to be free from all\ndifference).--Nor is there any shade even of 'implication' in the judgment,\n'This person is that Devadatta'; for there is absolutely no contradiction\nbetween the past Devadatta, who was connected with some distant place, and the\npresent Devadatta, who is connected with the place before us. For this very\nreason those who maintain the permanency of\n\np. 222\n\nthings prove the oneness of a thing related to two moments of time on the\nbasis of the judgment of recognition ('this is that'); if there really were a\ncontradiction between the two representations it would follow that all things\nare (not permanent but) momentary only. The fact is that the contradiction\ninvolved in one thing being connected with two places is removed by the\ndifference of the correlative moments of time. We therefore hold to the\nconclusion that co-ordinated words denote one thing qualified by the\npossession of several attributes.\n\nFor this very reason the Vedic passage, 'He buys the Soma by means of a cow\none year old, of a tawny colour, with reddish-brown eyes' (aru _n_ aya,\nekahayanya, pi\xc3\xb1gakshya), must be understood to enjoin that the purchase is to\nbe effected by means of a cow one year old, possessing the attributes of tawny\ncolour, &c. This point is discussed Pu. Mi. Su. III, 1, l2.--The Purvapakshin\nthere argues as follows: We admit that the word 'aru _n_ aya' ('by means of a\ntawny one') denotes the quality of tawniness inclusive of the thing possessing\nthat quality; for qualities as well as generic character exist only in so far\nas being modes of substances. But it is not possible to restrict tawny colour\nto connexion with a cow one year old, for the injunction of two different\nthings (which would result from such restriction; and which would necessitate\nthe sentence to be construed as----) 'He buys by means of a cow one year old,\nand that a red one' is not permissible 1. We must therefore break up the\nsentence into two, one of which is constituted by the one word 'aru _n_ aya'--\nthis word expressing that tawny colour extends equally to all the substances\nenjoined in that section (as instrumental towards the end of the sacrifice).\nAnd the use of the feminine case-termination of the word is merely meant to\nsuggest a special instance (viz. the cow) of all the things, of whatever\ngender, which are enjoined in that section. Tawniness must not therefore\n\np. 223\n\nbe restricted to the cow one year old only.--Of this purvapaksha the Sutra\ndisposes in the following words: 'There being oneness of sense, and hence\nconnexion of substance and quality with one action, there is restriction.'--\nThe fact that the two words 'aru _n_ aya' and 'ekahayanya'--which denote a\nsubstance, viz. a cow one year old, distinguished by the quality of possessing\ntawny colour--stand in co-ordination establishes that they have one sense; and\nis the substance, viz. the cow, and the quality, viz. tawny colour--which the\nword 'aru _n_ aya' denotes as standing in the relation of distinguishing\nattribute and thing distinguished thereby--can thus, without any\ncontradiction, be connected with the one action called 'the buying of the\nSoma', tawny colour is restricted to the cow one year old which is\ninstrumental with regard to the purchase. If the connexion of tawniness with\nthe action of buying were to be determined from syntactical connexion--in the\nsame way as there is made out the connexion of the cow one year old with that\naction--then the injunctory sentence would indeed enjoin two matters (and this\nwould be objectionable). But such is not the case; for the one word 'aru _n_\nya' denotes a substance characterised by the quality of tawniness, and the co-\nordination in which 'aru _n_ aya' stands to 'ekahayanya' makes us apprehend\nmerely that the thing characterised by tawniness also is one year old, but\ndoes not make a special statement as to the connexion of that quality with the\nthing. For the purport of co-ordination is the unity of a thing distinguished\nby attributes; according to the definition that the application to one thing\nof several words possessing different reasons of application, constitutes co-\nordination. For the same reason, the syntactical unity (ekavakyatvam) of\nsentences such as 'the cloth is red' follows from all the words referring to\none thing. The function of the syntactical collocation is to express the\nconnexion of the cloth with the action of being; the connexion of the red\ncolour (with the cloth) on the other hand is denoted by the word 'red' only.\nAnd what is ascertained from co-ordination (samanadhikara _n_ ya) is only that\nthe cloth is a substance to which a certain colour belongs.\n\np. 224\n\n[paragraph continues] The whole matter may, without any contradiction, be\nconceived as follows. Several words--having either the affixes of the oblique\ncases or that of the nominative case--which denote one or two or several\nqualities, present to the mind the idea of that which is characterised by\nthose qualities, and their co-ordination intimates that the thing\ncharacterised by all those attributes is one only; and the entire sentence\nfinally expresses the connexion in which the thing with its attributes stands\nto the action denoted by the verb. This may be illustrated by various\nsentences exhibiting the co-ordination of words possessing different case-\nendings, as e.g. 'There stands Devadatta, a young man of a darkish complexion,\nwith red eyes, wearing earrings and carrying a stick' (where all the words\nstanding in apposition to Devadatta have the nominative termination); 'Let him\nmake a stage curtain by means of a white cloth' (where 'white' and 'cloth'\nhave instrumental case-endings), &c. &c. We may further illustrate the entire\nrelation of co-ordinated words to the action by means of the following two\nexamples: 'Let him boil rice in the cooking-pot by means of firewood': here we\ntake in simultaneously the idea of an action distinguished by its connexion\nwith several things. If we now consider the following amplified sentence, 'Let\na skilful cook prepare, in a vessel of even shape, boiled rice mixed with\nmilk, by means of sticks of dry khadira wood,' we find that each thing\nconnected with the action is denoted by an aggregate of co-ordinated words;\nbut as soon as each thing is apprehended, it is at one and the same moment\nconceived as something distinguished by several attributes, and as such\nconnects itself with the action expressed by the verb. In all this there is no\ncontradiction whatever.--We must further object to the assertion that a word\ndenoting a quality which stands in a sentence that has already mentioned a\nsubstance denotes the quality only (exclusive of the substance so qualified),\nand that hence the word 'aru _n_ aya' also denotes a quality only. The fact is\nthat neither in ordinary nor in Vedic language we ever meet with a word which\n--denoting a quality and at the same time standing in co-ordination\n\np. 225\n\nwith a word denoting a substance--denotes a _mere_ quality. Nor is it correct\nto say that a quality-word occurring in a sentence which has already mentioned\na substance denotes a mere quality: for in a sentence such as 'the cloth (is)\nwhite,' where a substance is mentioned in the first place, the quality-word\nclearly denotes (not mere whiteness but) something which possesses the quality\nof whiteness. When, on the other hand, we have a collocation of words such as\n'pa _t_ asya _s_ ukla _h_ ' ('of the cloth'--gen.; 'white' nom.), the idea of\na cloth distinguished by whiteness does not arise; but this is due not to the\nfact of the substance being mentioned first, but to the fact of the two words\nexhibiting different case-terminations. As soon as we add to those two words\nan appropriate third one, e.g. 'bhaga _h_ ' (so that the whole means 'The\nwhite part of a cloth'), the co-ordination of two words with the same case-\ntermination gives rise to the idea of a thing distinguished by the attribute\nof whiteness.--Nor can we agree to the contention that, as the buying of the\nSoma is exclusively concluded by the cow one year old (as instrumental in the\npurchase), the quality of tawniness (denoted by the word 'aru _n_ aya') cannot\nconnect itself with the action expressed by the verb; for a word that denotes\na quality and stands in co-ordination with a word denoting a substance which\nhas no qualities opposed in nature to that quality, denotes a quality abiding\nin that substance, and thus naturally connects itself with the action\nexpressed by the verb. And since, as shown, the quality of tawniness connects\nitself with its substance (the cow) on the mere basis of the form of the\nwords, it is wrong (on the part of the Purvapakshin to abandon this natural\nconnexion and) to establish their connexion on the ground of their being\notherwise incapable of serving as means of the purchase.\n\nAll this confirms our contention, viz. that the co-ordination of 'thou' and\n'that' must be understood to express oneness, without, at the same time, there\nbeing given up the different attributes denoted by the two words. This however\nis not feasible for those who do not admit a highest Self free from all\nimperfection and endowed with all perfections, and different from that\nintelligent soul which\n\np. 226\n\nis conditioned by Nescience, involved in endless suffering and undergoing\nalternate states of purity and impurity.--But, an objection is raised, even if\nsuch a highest Self be acknowledged, it would have to be admitted that the\nsentence aims at conveying the oneness of that which is distinguished by the\ndifferent attributes denoted by the words co-ordinated, and from this it\nfollows that the highest Self participates in all the suffering expressed by\nthe word 'thou'!--This is not so, we reply; since the word 'thou' also denotes\nthe highest Self, viz. in so far as it is the inner Ruler (antaryamin) of all\nsouls.--The connected meaning of the text is as follows. That which is denoted\nas 'Being,' i.e. the highest Brahman which is the cause of all, free from all\nshadow of imperfection, &c., resolved 'to be many'; it thereupon sent forth\nthe entire world, consisting of fire, water, &c.; introduced, in this world so\nsent forth, the whole mass of individual souls into different bodies divine,\nhuman, &c., corresponding to the desert of each soul--the souls thus\nconstituting the Self of the bodies; and finally, itself entering according to\nits wish into these souls--so as to constitute their inner Self--evolved in\nall these aggregates, names and forms, i.e. rendered each aggregate something\nsubstantial (vastu) and capable of being denoted by a word. 'Let me enter into\nthese beings with this living Self ( _g_ ivena atmana) means 'with this living\n_me_ ,' and this shows the living Self, i.e. the individual soul to have\nBrahman for its Self. And that this having Brahman for its Self means\nBrahman's being the inner Self of the soul (i.e. the Self inside the soul, but\nnot identical with it), Scripture declares by saying that Brahman entered into\nit. This is clearly stated in the passage Taitt. Up. II, 6, 'He sent forth all\nthis, whatever there is. Having sent forth he entered into it. Having entered\nit he became _sat_ and _tyat_.' For here 'all this' comprises beings\nintelligent as well as non-intelligent, which afterwards are distinguished as\n_sat_ and _tyat_ , as knowledge (vi _g_ \xc3\xb1ana) and non-knowledge. Brahman is\nthus said to enter into intelligent beings also. Hence, owing to this\nevolution of names and forms, all words denote the highest Self distinguished\n\np. 227\n\nby non-intelligent matter and intelligent souls.--Another text, viz. _Kh_. Up.\nVI, 8, 7,'All this has its Self in that,' denotes by 'all this' the entire\nworld inclusive of intelligent souls, and says that of this world that (i.e.\nBrahman) is the Self. Brahman thus being the Self with regard to the whole\nuniverse of matter and souls, the universe inclusive of intelligent souls is\nthe body of Brahman.--Other scriptural texts teach the same doctrine; cp.\n'Entered within, the ruler of beings, the Self of all' (Taitt.\xc3\x82r. III, 24);'He\nwho dwelling in the earth is within the earth--whose body is the earth,' &c.,\nup to 'he who dwelling within the Self is within the Self, whom the Self does\nnot know, of whom the Self is the body, who rules the Self from within, he is\nthy Self, the Ruler within, the Immortal' (B _ri_. Up. III, 7, 3-22; Madhyand.\nSa.); 'He who moves within the earth, of whom the earth is the body, &c.--who\nmoves within the Imperishable, of whom the Imperishable is the body, whom the\nImperishable does not know; he the inward ruler of all beings, free from evil,\nthe divine, the one god, Naraya _n_ a' (Suba. Up. VII). All these texts\ndeclare that the world inclusive of intelligent souls is the body of the\nhighest Self, and the latter the Self of everything. Hence those words also\nthat denote intelligent souls designate the highest Self as having intelligent\nsouls for his body and constituting the Self of them; in the same way as words\ndenoting non-sentient masses of matter, such as the bodies of gods, men, &c.,\ndesignate the individual souls to which those bodies belong. For the body\nstands towards the embodied soul in the relation of a mode (prakara); and as\nwords denoting a mode accomplish their full function only in denoting the\nthing to which the mode belongs, we must admit an analogous comprehensiveness\nof meaning for those words which denote a body. For, when a thing is\napprehended under the form 'this is such,' the element apprehended as 'such'\nis what constitutes a mode; now as this element is relative to the thing, the\nidea of it is also relative to the thing, and finds its accomplishment in the\nthing only; hence the word also which expresses the mode finds its\naccomplishment in the thing. Hence words such as 'cow', 'horse, 'man', which\n\np. 228\n\ndenote a mode, viz. a species, comprise in their meaning also that mass of\nmatter which exhibits the characteristics of the species, and as that mass of\nmatter constitutes the body and therefore is a mode of a soul, and as that\nsoul again, so embodied, is a mode of the highest Self; it follows that all\nthese words extend in their signification up to the highest Self. The meaning\nof all words then is the highest Self, and hence their co-ordination with\nwords directly denoting that highest Self is a primary (not merely 'implied')\none.\n\nBut, an objection is raised, we indeed observe that words denoting species or\nqualities stand in co-ordination to words denoting substances, 'the ox is\nshort-horned,' 'the sugar is white'; but where substances appear as the modes\nof other substances we find that formative affixes are used, 'the man is da\n_nd_ in, ku _nd_ alin' (bearing a stick; wearing earrings).--This is not so,\nwe reply. There is nothing to single out either species, or quality, or\nsubstance, as what determines co-ordination: co-ordination disregards such\nlimitations. Whenever a _thing_ (whether species, or quality, or substance)\nhas existence as a _mode_ only--owing to its proof, existence and conception\nbeing inseparably connected with something else--the words denoting it, as\nthey designate a substance characterised by the attribute denoted by them,\nappropriately enter into co-ordination with other words denoting the same\nsubstance as characterised by other attributes. Where, on the other hand, a\nsubstance which is established in separation from other things and rests on\nitself, is assumed to stand occasionally in the relation of mode to another\nsubstance, this is appropriately expressed by the use of derived forms such as\n'da _nd_ in, ku _nd_ alin.' Hence such words as 'I,' 'thou,' &c., which are\ndifferent forms of appellation of the individual soul, at bottom denote the\nhighest Self only; for the individual souls together with non-sentient matter\nare the body--and hence modes--of the highest Self. This entire view is\ncondensed in the co-ordination 'Thou art that.' The individual soul being thus\nconnected with the highest Self as its body, its attributes do not touch the\nhighest\n\np. 229\n\n[paragraph continues] Self, not any more than infancy, youth, and other\nattributes of the material body touch the individual soul. Hence, in the co-\nordination 'Thou art that,' the word 'that' denotes the highest Brahman which\nis the cause of the world, whose purposes come true, which comprises within\nitself all blessed qualities, which is free from all shadow of evil; while the\nword 'thou' denotes the same highest Self in so far as having for its body the\nindividual souls together with their bodies. The terms co-ordinated may thus\nbe taken in their primary senses; there is no contradiction either with the\nsubject-matter of the section, or with scripture in general; and not a shadow\nof imperfection such as Nescience, and so on, attaches to Brahman, the\nblameless, the absolutely blessed. The co-ordination with the individual soul\nthus proves only the difference of Brahman from the soul, which is a mere mode\nof Brahman; and hence we hold that different from the Self consisting of\nknowledge, i.e. the individual soul, is the Self consisting of bliss, i.e. the\nhighest Self.\n\nNor is there any force in the objection that as the Self of bliss is said to\nbe 'sarira,' i.e. embodied-viz. in the clause 'of him the embodied Self is the\nsame' (Taitt. Up. II, 5, 6)--it cannot be different from the individual soul.\nFor throughout this section the recurring clause 'of him the embodied Self is\nthe same as of the preceding one,' refers to the highest Self, calling that\nthe 'embodied' one. The clause 'From that same Self sprang ether' (II, 1)\ndesignates the highest Brahman-which is different from the individual soul and\nis introduced as the highest cause of all things created--as the 'Self';\nwhence we conclude that all things different from it--from ether up to the\nSelf of food constitute its body. The Subala-upanishad moreover states quite\ndirectly that all beings constitute the body of the highest Self: 'He of whom\nthe earth is the body, of whom water is the body, of whom fire is the body, of\nwhom wind is the body, of whom ether is the body, of whom the Imperishable is\nthe body, of whom Death is the body, he the inner Self of all, the divine one,\nthe one god Naraya _n_ a.' From this it follows that what constitutes the\n\np. 230\n\nembodied Self of the Self of food is nothing else but the highest Self\nreferred to in the clause 'From that same Self sprang ether.' When, then, the\ntext further on says with regard to the Self of breath, 'of him the embodied\nSelf is the same as of the preceding one' (II, 3), the meaning can only be\nthat what constitutes the embodied Self of the 'preceding' Self of food, viz.\nthe highest Self which is the universal cause, is also the embodied Self of\nthe Self consisting of breath. The same reasoning holds good with regard to\nthe Self consisting of mind and the Self consisting of knowledge. In the case,\nfinally, of the Self consisting of bliss, the expression 'the same' (esha eva)\nis meant to convey that that Self has its Self in nothing different from\nitself. For when, after having understood that the highest Self is the\nembodied Self of the vi _g \xc3\xb1_anamaya also, we are told that the embodied Self\nof that vi _g \xc3\xb1_anamaya is also the embodied Self of the anandamaya, we\nunderstand that of the anandamaya--which we know to be the highest Self on the\nground of 'multiplication'--its own Self is the Self. The final purport of the\nwhole section thus is that everything different from the highest Self, whether\nof intelligent or non-intelligent nature, constitutes its body, while that\nSelf alone is the non-conditioned embodied Self. For this very reason\ncompetent persons designate this doctrine which has the highest Brahman for\nits subject-matter as the ' _s_ ariraka,' i. e. the doctrine of the 'embodied'\nSelf.--We have thus arrived at the conclusion that the Self of bliss is\nsomething different from the individual Self, viz. the highest Self.\n\nHere the Purvapakshin raises the following objection.--The Self consisting of\nbliss (anandamaya) is not something different from the individual soul,\nbecause the formative element--maya denotes something made, a thing effected.\nThat this is the meaning of--maya in anandamaya we know from Pa _n_ ini IV, 3,\nl44.--But according to Pa. V, 4, 21,--maya has also the sense of 'abounding\nin'; as when we say 'the sacrifice is annamaya,' i.e. abounds in food. And\nthis may be its sense in 'anandamaya' also!--Not so, the Purvapakshin replies.\nIn 'annamaya,' in an earlier part of the chapter,--maya has the sense of 'made\nof', 'consisting\n\np. 231\n\nof'; and for the sake of consistency, we must hence ascribe the same sense to\nit in 'anandamaya.' And even if, in the latter word, it denoted abundance,\nthis would not prove that the anandamaya is other than the individual soul.\nFor if we say that a Self 'abounds' in bliss, this implies that with all this\nbliss there is mixed some small part of pain; and to be 'mixed with pain' is\nwhat constitutes the character of the individual soul. It is therefore proper\nto assume, in agreement with its previous use, that 'anandamaya' means\n'consisting of bliss.' In ordinary speech as well as in Vedic language (cp.\ncommon words such as 'm _ri_ nmaya,' 'hira _n_ maya'; and Vedic clauses such\nas 'par _n_ amayi _g_ uhu _h_ ') -maya as a rule means 'consisting of,' and\nthis meaning hence presents itself to the mind first. And the individual soul\n_may_ be denoted as 'made of bliss'; for in itself it is of the essence of\nbliss, and its Sa _m_ sara state therefore is something 'made of bliss.' The\nconclusion therefore is that, owing to the received meaning of -maya, the\nanandamaya is none other than the individual soul.--To this prima facie view\nthe next Sutra refers and refutes it.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[219:1](sbe48046.htm#fr_28) I.e. we should not in that case be able to decide\nwhether the quality (i.e., here, the blueness) inheres in the class (i.e.,\nhere, the lotus), or vice versa.\n\n[222:1](sbe48046.htm#fr_29) For it would imply so-called vakyabheda, 'split of\nthe sentence,' which arises when one injunctory clause is made to enjoin two\ndifferent things.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 14.
