Looking at many of the books that\nhave lately been published on the religions of the ancient world, I do not\nwonder that such a belief should have been raised; but I have long felt that\nit was high time to dispel such illusions, and to place the study of the\nancient religions of the world on a more real and sound, on a more truly\nhistorical basis. It is but natural that those who write on\n\np. x\n\nancient religions, and who have studied them from translations only, not from\noriginal documents, should have had eyes for their bright rather than for\ntheir dark sides. The former absorb all the attention of the student, the\nlatter, as they teach nothing, seem hardly to deserve any notice. Scholars\nalso who have devoted their life either to the editing of the original texts\nor to the careful interpretation of some of the sacred books, are more\ninclined, after they have disinterred from a heap of rubbish some solitary\nfragments of pure gold, to exhibit these treasures only than to display all\nthe refuse from which they had to extract them. I do not blame them for this,\nperhaps I should feel that I was open to the same blame myself, for it is but\nnatural that scholars in their joy at finding one or two fragrant fruits or\nflowers should gladly forget the brambles and thorns that had to be thrown\naside in the course of their search.\n\nBut whether I am myself one of the guilty or not, I cannot help calling\nattention to the real mischief that has been done and is still being done by\nthe enthusiasm of those pioneers who have opened the first avenues through the\nbewildering forest of the sacred literature of the East. They have raised\nexpectations that cannot be fulfilled, fears also that, as will be easily\nseen, are unfounded. Anyhow they have removed the study of religion from that\nwholesome and matter-of-fact atmosphere in which alone it can produce valuable\nand permanent results.\n\nThe time has come when the study of the ancient religions of mankind must be\napproached in a different, in a less enthusiastic, and more discriminating, in\nfact, in a more scholarlike spirit. Not\n\np. xi\n\nthat I object to dilettanti, if they only are what by their name they profess\nto be, devoted lovers, and not mere amateurs. The religions of antiquity must\nalways be approached in a loving spirit, and the dry and cold-blooded scholar\nis likely to do here as much mischief as the enthusiastic sciolist. But true\nlove does not ignore all faults and failings: on the contrary, it scans them\nkeenly, though only in order to be able to understand, to explain, and thus to\nexcuse them. To watch in the Sacred Books of the East the dawn of the\nreligious consciousness of man, must always remain one of the most inspiring\nand hallowing sights in the whole history of the world; and he whose heart\ncannot quiver with the first quivering rays of human thought and human faith,\nas revealed in those ancient documents, is, in his own way, as unfit for these\nstudies as, from another side, the man who shrinks from copying and collating\nancient MSS., or toiling through volumes of tedious commentary. What we want\nhere, as everywhere else, is the truth, and the whole truth; and if the whole\ntruth must be told, it is that, however radiant the dawn of religious thought,\nit is not without its dark clouds, its chilling colds, its noxious vapours.\nWhoever does not know these, or would hide them from his own sight and from\nthe sight of others, does not know and can never understand the real toil and\ntravail of the human heart in its first religious aspirations; and not knowing\nits toil and travail, can never know the intensity of its triumphs and its\njoys.\n\nIn order to have a solid foundation for a comparative study of the religions\nof the East, we must have before all things complete and thoroughly\n\np. xii\n\nfaithful translations of their sacred books. Extracts will no longer suffice.\nWe do not know Germany, if we know the Rhine; nor Rome, when we have admired\nSt. Peter's. No one who collects and publishes such extracts can resist, no\none at all events, so far as I know, has ever resisted, the temptation of\ngiving what is beautiful, or it may be what is strange and startling, and\nleaving out what is commonplace, tedious, or it may be repulsive, or, lastly,\nwhat is difficult to construe and to understand. We must face the problem in\nits completeness, and I confess it has been for many years a problem to me,\naye, and to a great extent is so still, how the Sacred Books of the East\nshould, by the side of so much that is fresh, natural, simple, beautiful, and\ntrue, contain so much that is not only unmeaning, artificial, and silly, but\neven hideous and repellent. This is a fact, and must be accounted for in some\nway or other.\n\nTo some minds this problem may seem to be no problem at all. To those (and I\ndo not speak of Christians only) who look upon the sacred books of all\nreligions except their own as necessarily the outcome of human or superhuman\nignorance and depravity, the mixed nature of their contents may seem to be\nexactly what it ought to be, what they expected it would be. But there are\nother and more reverent minds who can feel a divine afflatus in the sacred\nbooks, not only of their own, but of other religions also, and to them the\nmixed character of some of the ancient sacred canons must always be extremely\nperplexing.\n\nI can account for it to a certain extent, though not entirely to my own\nsatisfaction. Most of\n\np. xiii\n\nthe ancient sacred books have been handed down by oral tradition for many\ngenerations before they were consigned to writing. In an age when there was\nnothing corresponding to what we call literature, every saying, every proverb,\nevery story handed down from father to son, received very soon a kind of\nhallowed character. They became sacred heirlooms, sacred, because they came\nfrom an unknown source, from a distant age. There was a stage in the\ndevelopment of human thought, when the distance that separated the living\ngeneration from their grandfathers or great-grandfathers was as yet the\nnearest approach to a conception of eternity, and when the name of grandfather\nand great-grandfather seemed the nearest expression of God 1. Hence, what had\nbeen said by these half-human, half-divine ancestors, if it was preserved at\nall, was soon looked upon as a more than human utterance. It was received with\nreverence, it was never questioned and criticised.\n\nSome of these ancient sayings were preserved because they were so true and so\nstriking that they could not be forgotten. They contained eternal truths,\nexpressed for the first time in human language. Of such oracles of truth it\nwas said in India that they had been heard, _s_ ruta, and from it arose the\nword sruti, the recognised term for divine revelation in Sanskrit.\n\nBut besides those utterances which had a vitality of their own, strong enough\nto defy the power of\n\np. xiv\n\ntime, there were others which might have struck the minds of the listeners\nwith great force under the peculiar circumstances that evoked them, but which,\nwhen these circumstances were forgotten, became trivial and almost\nunintelligible. A few verses sung by warriors on the eve of a great battle\nwould, if that battle ended in victory, assume a charm quite independent of\ntheir poetic merit. They would be repeated in memory of the heroes who\nconquered, and of the gods who granted victory. But when the heroes, and the\ngods, and the victory were all forgotten, the song of victory and thanksgiving\nwould often survive as a relic of the past, though almost unintelligible to\nlater generations.\n\nEven a single ceremonial act, performed at the time of a famine or an\ninundation, and apparently attended with a sudden and almost miraculous\nsuccess, might often be preserved in the liturgical code of a family or a\ntribe with a superstitious awe entirely beyond our understanding. It might be\nrepeated for some time on similar emergencies, till when it had failed again\nand again it survived only as a superstitious custom in the memory of priests\nand poets.\n\nFurther, it should be remembered that in ancient as in modern times, the\nutterances of men who had once gained a certain prestige, would often receive\nattention far beyond their merits, so that in many a family or tribe the\nsayings and teachings of one man, who had once in his youth or manhood uttered\nwords of inspired wisdom, would all be handed down together, without any\nattempt to separate the grain from the chaff.\n\np. xv\n\nNor must we forget that though oral tradition, when once brought under proper\ndiscipline, is a most faithful guardian, it is not without its dangers in its\nincipient stages. Many a word may have been misunderstood, many a sentence\nconfused, as it was told by father to son, before it became fixed in the\ntradition of a village community, and then resisted by its very sacredness all\nattempts at emendation.\n\nLastly, we must remember that those who handed down the ancestral treasures of\nancient wisdom, would often feel inclined to add what seemed useful to\nthemselves, and what they knew could be preserved in one way only, namely, if\nit was allowed to form part of the tradition that had to be handed down, as a\nsacred trust, from generation to generation. The priestly influence was at\nwork, even before there were priests by profession, and when the priesthood\nhad once become professional, its influence may account for much that would\notherwise seem inexplicable in the sacred codes of the ancient world.\n\nThese are some of the considerations which may help to explain how, mixed up\nwith real treasures of thought, we meet in the sacred books with so many\npassages and whole chapters which either never had any life or meaning at all,\nor if they had, have, in the form in which they have come down to us,\ncompletely lost it. We must try to imagine what the Old Testament would have\nbeen, if it had not been kept distinct from the Talmud; or the New Testament,\nif it had been mixed up not only with the spurious gospels, but with the\nrecords of the wranglings of the early Councils, if we wish to understand, to\nsome extent at least, the wild confusion of sublime truth\n\np. xvi\n\nwith vulgar stupidity that meets us in the pages of the Veda, the Avesta, and\nthe Tripi _t_ aka. The idea of keeping the original and genuine tradition\nseparate from apocryphal accretions was an idea of later growth, that could\nspring up only after the earlier tendency of preserving whatever could be\npreserved of sacred or half-sacred lore, had done its work, and wrought its\nown destruction.\n\nIn using, what may seem to some of my fellow-workers, this very strong and\nalmost irreverent language with regard to the ancient Sacred Books of the\nEast, I have not neglected to make full allowance for that very important\nintellectual parallax which, no doubt, renders it most difficult for a Western\nobserver to see things and thoughts under exactly the same angle and in the\nsame light as they would appear to an Eastern eye. There are Western\nexpressions which offend Eastern taste as much as Eastern expressions are apt\nto offend Western taste. A symphony of Beethoven's would be mere noise to an\nIndian ear, an Indian Sa\xe1\xb9\x85gita seems to us without melody, harmony, or rhythm.\nAll this I fully admit, yet after making every allowance for national taste\nand traditions, I still confidently appeal to the best Oriental scholars, who\nhave not entirely forgotten that there is a world outside the four walls of\ntheir study, whether they think that my condemnation is too severe, or that\nEastern nations themselves would tolerate, in any of their classical literary\ncompositions, such violations of the simplest rules of taste as they have\naccustomed themselves to tolerate, if not to admire, in their sacred books.\n\nBut then it might no doubt be objected that books of such a character hardly\ndeserve the honour of\n\np. xvii\n\nbeing translated into English, and that the sooner they are forgotten, the\nbetter. Such opinions have of late been freely expressed by some eminent\nwriters, and supported by arguments worthy of the Khalif Omar himself. In\nthese days of anthropological research, when no custom is too disgusting to be\nrecorded, no rules of intermarriage too complicated to be disentangled, it may\nseem strange that the few genuine relics of ancient religion which, as by a\nmiracle, have been preserved to us, should thus have been judged from a purely\naesthetic, and not from an historical point of view. There was some excuse for\nthis in the days of Sir William Jones and Colebrooke. The latter, as is well\nknown, considered 'the Vedas as too voluminous for a complete translation of\nthe whole,' adding that (what they contain would hardly reward the labour of\nthe reader; much less that of the translator 1.' The former went still further\nin the condemnation which he pronounced on Anquetil Duperron's translation of\nthe Zend-avesta. Sir W. Jones, we must remember, was not only a scholar, but\nalso a man of taste, and the man of taste sometimes gained a victory over the\nscholar. His controversy with Anquetil Duperron, the discoverer of the Zend-\navesta, is well known. It was carried on by Sir W. Jones apparently with great\nsuccess, and yet in the end the victor has proved to be the vanquished. It was\neasy, no doubt, to pick out from Anquetil Duperron's translation of the sacred\nwritings of Zoroaster hundreds of passages which were or seemed to be utterly\nunmeaning or absurd. This arose partly, but partly only, from the\nimperfections\n\np. xviii\n\nof the translation. Much, however, of what Sir W. Jones represented as\nridiculous, and therefore unworthy of Zoroaster, and therefore unworthy of\nbeing translated, forms an integral part of the sacred code of the\nZoroastrians. Sir W. Jones smiles at those who 'think obscurity sublime and\nvenerable, like that of ancient cloisters and temples, shedding,' as Milton\nexpresses it, 'a dim religious light 1.' 'On possedait deja,' he writes in his\nletter addressed to Anquetil Duperron, and composed in very good and sparkling\nFrench, 'plusieurs traites attribues a Zardusht ou Zeratusht, traduits en\nPersan moderne; de pretendues conferences de ce legislateur avec Ormuzd, des\nprieres, des dogmes, des lois religieuses. Quelques savans, qui ont lu ces\ntraductions, nous ont assure que les originaux etaient de la plus haute\nantiquite, parce qu'ils renfermaient beaucoup de platitudes, de bevues, et de\ncontradictions: mais nous avons conclu par les memes raisons, qu'ils etaient\ntres-modernes, ou bien qu'ils n'etaient pas d'un homme d'esprit, et d'un\nphilosophe, tel que Zoroastre est peint par nos historiens. Votre nouvelle\ntraduction, Monsieur, nous confirme dans ce jugement: tout le college des\nGuebres aurait beau nous l'assurer; nous ne croirons jamais que le charlatan\nle moins habile ait pu ecrire les fadaises dont vos deux derniers volumes sont\nremplis 2.' He at last sums up his argument in the following words: 'Ou\nZoroastre n'avait pas le sens commun, ou il n'ecrivit pas le livre que vous\nlui attribuez: s'il n'avait pas le sens commun, il fallait le laisser dans la\nfoule, et dans l'obscurite; s'il n'ecrivit pas\n\np. xix\n\nce livre, il etait impudent de le publier sous son nom. Ainsi, ou vous avez\ninsulte le gout du public en lui presentant des sottises, ou vous l'avez\ntrompe en lui donnant des faussetes: et de chaque cote vous meritez son mepris\n1.'\n\nThis alternative holds good no longer. The sacred code of Zoroaster or of any\nother of the founders of religions may appear to us to be full of absurdities,\nor may in fact really be so, and it may yet be the duty of the scholar to\npublish, to translate, and carefully to examine those codes as memorials of\nthe past, as the only trustworthy documents in which to study the growth and\ndecay of religion. It does not answer to say that if Zoroaster was what we\nbelieve him to have been, a wise man, in our sense of the word, he could not\nhave written the rubbish which we find in the Avesta. If we are once satisfied\nthat the text of the Avesta, or the Veda, or the Tripi _t_ aka is old and\ngenuine, and that this text formed the foundation on which, during many\ncenturies, the religious belief of millions of human beings was based, it\nbecomes our duty, both as historians and philosophers, to study these books,\nto try to understand how they could have arisen, and how they could have\nexercised for ages an influence over human beings who in all other respects\nwere not inferior to ourselves, nay, whom we are accustomed to look up to on\nmany points as patterns of wisdom, of virtue, and of taste.\n\nThe facts, such as they are, must be faced, if the study of the ancient\nreligions of the world is ever to assume a really historical character; and\nhaving\n\np. xx\n\nmyself grudged no praise to what to my mind is really beautiful or sublime in\nthe early revelations of religious truth, I feel the less hesitation in\nfulfilling the duty of the true scholar, and placing before historians and\nphilosophers accurate, complete, and unembellished versions of some of the\nsacred books of the East. Such versions alone will enable them to form a true\nand just estimate of the real development of early religious thought, so far\nas we can still gain a sight of it in literary records to which the highest\nhuman or even divine authority has been ascribed by the followers of the great\nreligions of antiquity. It often requires an effort to spoil a beautiful\nsentence by a few words which might so easily be suppressed, but which are\nthere in the original, and must be taken into account quite as much as the\npointed ears in the beautiful Faun of the Capitol. We want to know the ancient\nreligions such as they really were, not such as we wish they should have been.\nWe want to know, not their wisdom only, but their folly also; and while we\nmust learn to look up to their highest points where they seem to rise nearer\nto heaven than anything we were acquainted with before, we must not shrink\nfrom looking down into their stony tracts, their dark abysses, their muddy\nmoraines, in order to comprehend both the [height](errata.htm#0) and the depth\nof the human mind in its searchings after the Infinite.\n\nI can answer for myself and for those who have worked with me, that our\ntranslations are truthful, that we have suppressed nothing, that we have\nvarnished nothing, however hard it seemed sometimes even to write it down.\n\nThere is only one exception. There are in ancient books,\n\np. xxi\n\nand particularly in religious books, frequent allusions to the sexual aspects\nof nature, which, though perfectly harmless and innocent in themselves, cannot\nbe rendered in modern language without the appearance of coarseness. We may\nregret that it should be so, but tradition is too strong on this point, and I\nhave therefore felt obliged to leave certain passages untranslated, and to\ngive the original, when necessary, in a note. But this has been done in\nextreme cases only, and many things which we should feel inclined to suppress\nhave been left in all their outspoken simplicity, because those who want to\nstudy ancient man, must learn to study him as he really was, an animal, with\nall the strength and weaknesses of an animal, though an animal that was to\nrise above himself, and in the end discover his true self, after many\nstruggles and many defeats.\n\n\n\nAfter this first caution, which I thought was due to those who might expect to\nfind in these volumes nothing but gems, I feel I owe another to those who may\napproach these translations under the impression that they have only to read\nthem in order to gain an insight into the nature and character of the\nreligions of mankind. There are philosophers who have accustomed themselves to\nlook upon religions as things that can be studied as they study the manners\nand customs of savage tribes, by glancing at the entertaining accounts of\ntravellers or missionaries, and. then classing each religion under such wide\ncategories as fetishism, polytheism, monotheism, and the rest. That is not the\ncase. Translations can do much, but they can never take the place of the\noriginals, and if the originals require not only to be\n\np. xxii\n\nread, but to be read again and again, translations of sacred books require to\nbe studied with much greater care, before we can hope to gain a real\nunderstanding of the intentions of their authors or venture on general\nassertions.\n\nSuch general assertions, if once made, are difficult to extirpate. It has been\nstated, for instance, that the religious notion of sin is wanting altogether\nin the hymns of the Rig-veda, and some important conclusions have been based\non this supposed fact. Yet the gradual growth of the concept of guilt is one\nof the most interesting lessons which certain passages of these ancient hymns\ncan teach us 1. It has been asserted that in the Rig-veda Agni, fire, was\nadored essentially as earthly sacrificial fire, and not as an elemental force.\nHow greatly such an assertion has to be qualified, may be seen from a more\ncareful examination of the translations of the Vedic hymns now accessible 2.\nIn many parts of the Avesta fire is no doubt spoken of with great reverence,\nbut those who speak of the Zoroastrians as fire-worshippers, should know that\nthe true followers of Zoroaster abhor that very name. Again, there are\ncertainly many passages in the Vedic writings which prohibit the promiscuous\ncommunication of the Veda, but those who maintain that the Brahmans, like\nRoman Catholic priests, keep their sacred books from the people, must have for\ngotten\n\np. xxiii\n\nthe many passages in the Brahma _n_ as, the Sutras, and even in the Laws of\nManu, where the duty of learning the Veda by heart is inculcated for every\nBrahma _n_ a, Kshatriya, Vaisya, that is, for every man except a _S_ udra.\n\nThese are a few specimens only to show how dangerous it is to generalise even\nwhere there exist complete translations of certain sacred books. It is far\neasier to misapprehend, or even totally to misunderstand, a translation than\nthe original; and it should not be supposed, because a sentence or a whole\nchapter seems at first sight unintelligible in a translation, that therefore\nthey are indeed devoid of all meaning.\n\nWhat can be more perplexing than the beginning of the _Kh_ andogya-upanishad?\n'Let a man meditate,' we read, or, as others translate it, 'Let a man worship\nthe syllable Om.' It may seem impossible at first sight to elicit any definite\nmeaning from these words and from much that follows after. But it would be a\nmistake, nevertheless, to conclude that we have here vox et praeterea nihil.\nMeditation on the syllable Om consisted in a long continued repetition of that\nsyllable with a view of drawing the thoughts away from all other subjects, and\nthus concentrating them on some higher object of thought of which that\nsyllable was made to be the symbol. This concentration of thought, ekagrata or\none-pointedness, as the Hindus called it, is something to us almost unknown.\nOur minds are like kaleidoscopes of thoughts in constant motion; and to shut\nour mental eyes to everything else, while dwelling on one thought only, has\nbecome to most of us almost as impossible as to apprehend one\n\np. xxiv\n\nmusical note without harmonics. With the life we are leading now, with\ntelegrams, letters, newspapers, reviews, pamphlets, and books ever breaking in\nupon us, it has become impossible, or almost impossible, ever to arrive at\nthat intensity of thought which the Hindus meant by ekagrata, and the\nattainment of which was to them the indispensable condition of all\nphilosophical and religious speculation. The loss may not be altogether on our\nside, yet a loss it is, and if we see the Hindus, even in their comparatively\nmonotonous life, adopting all kinds of contrivances in order to assist them in\ndrawing away their thoughts from all disturbing impressions and to fix them on\none subject only, we must not be satisfied with smiling at their simplicity,\nbut try to appreciate the object they had in view.\n\nWhen by means of repeating the syllable Om, which originally seems to have\nmeant 'that,' or 'yes,' they had arrived at a certain degree of mental\ntranquillity, the question arose what was meant by this Om, and to this\nquestion the most various answers were given, according as the mind was to be\nled up to higher and higher objects. Thus in one passage we are told at first\nthat Om is the beginning of the Veda, or, as we have to deal with an Upanishad\nof the Sama-veda, the beginning of the Sama-veda, so that he who meditates on\nOm, may be supposed to be meditating on the whole of the Sama-veda. But that\nis not enough. Om is said to be the essence of the Sama-veda, which, being\nalmost entirely taken from the Rig-veda, may itself be called the essence of\nthe Rig-veda. And more than that. The Rig-veda stands for all speech, the\nSama-veda for all breath or life, so that Om may be conceived again as the\n\np. xxv\n\nsymbol of all speech and all life. Om thus becomes the name, not only of all\nour physical and mental powers, but especially of the living principle, the\nPra _n_ a or spirit. This is explained by the parable in the second chapter,\nwhile in the third chapter, that spirit within us is identified with the\nspirit in the sun. He therefore who meditates on Om, meditates on the spirit\nin man as identical with the spirit in nature, or in the sun; and thus the\nlesson that is meant to be taught in the beginning of the _Kh_ andogya-\nupanishad is really this, that none of the Vedas with their sacrifices and\nceremonies could ever secure the salvation of the worshipper, i.e. that sacred\nworks, performed according to the rules of the Vedas, are of no avail in the\nend , but that meditation on Om alone, or that knowledge of what is meant by\nOm alone, can procure true salvation, or true immortality. Thus the pupil is\nled on step by step to what is the highest object of the Upanishads, viz. the\nrecognition of the self in man as identical with the Highest Self or Brahman.\nThe lessons which are to lead up to that highest conception of the universe,\nboth subjective and objective, are no doubt mixed up with much that is\nsuperstitious and absurd; still the main object is never lost sight of. Thus,\nwhen we come to the eighth chapter, the discussion, though it begins with Om\nor the Udgitha, ends with the question of the origin of the world; and though\nthe final answer, namely, that Om means ether (aka _s_ a), and that ether\n\np. xxvi\n\nis the origin of all things, may still sound to us more physical than\nmetaphysical, still the description given of ether or akasa, shows that more\nis meant by it than the physical ether, and that ether is in fact one of the\nearlier and less perfect names of the Infinite, of Brahman, the universal\nSelf. This, at least, is the lesson which the Brahmans themselves read in this\nchapter 1; and if we look at the ancient language of the Upanishads as\nrepresenting mere attempts at finding expression for what their language could\nhardly express as yet, we shall, I think, be less inclined to disagree with\nthe interpretation put on those ancient oracles by the later Vedanta\nphilosophers 2, or, at all events, we shall hesitate before we reject what is\ndifficult to interpret, as altogether devoid of meaning.\n\nThis is but one instance to show that even behind the fantastic and whimsical\nphraseology of the sacred writings of the Hindus and other Eastern nations,\nthere may be sometimes aspirations after truth which deserve careful\nconsideration from the student of the psychological development and the\nhistorical growth of early religious thought, and that after careful sifting,\ntreasures may be found in what at first we may feel inclined to throw away as\nutterly worthless.\n\nAnd now I come to the third caution. Let it not be supposed that a text, three\nthousand years old, or, even if of more modern date, still widely distant from\nour own sphere of thought, can be translated in the same manner as a book\n\np. xxvii\n\nwritten a few years ago in French or German. Those who know French and German\nwell enough, know how difficult, nay, how impossible it is, to render justice\nto certain touches of genius which the true artist knows how to give to a\nsentence. Many poets have translated Heine into English or Tennyson into\nGerman, many painters have copied the Madonna di San Sisto or the so-called\nportrait of Beatrice Cenci. But the greater the excellence of these\ntranslators, the more frank has been their avowal, that the original is beyond\ntheir reach. And what is a translation of modern German into modern English\ncompared with a translation of ancient Sanskrit or Zend or Chinese into any\nmodern language? It is an undertaking which, from its very nature, admits of\nthe most partial success only, and a more intimate knowledge of the ancient\nlanguage, so far from facilitating the task, of the translator, renders it\nonly more hopeless. Modern words are round, ancient words are square, and we\nmay as well hope to solve the quadrature of the circle, as to express\nadequately the ancient thoughts of the Veda in modern English.\n\nWe must not expect therefore that a translation of the sacred books of the\nancients can ever be more than an approximation of our language to theirs, of\nour thoughts to theirs. The translator, however, if he has once gained the\nconviction that it is impossible to translate old thought into modern speech,\nwithout doing some violence either to the one or to the other, will hardly\nhesitate in his choice between two evils. He will prefer to do some violence\nto language rather than to misrepresent old thoughts by clothing them in words\nwhich do\n\np. xxviii\n\nnot fit them. If therefore the reader finds some of these translations rather\nrugged, if he meets with expressions which sound foreign, with combinations of\nnouns and adjectives such as he has never seen before, with sentences that\nseem too long or too abrupt, let him feel sure that the translator has had to\ndeal with a choice of evils, and that when the choice lay between sacrificing\nidiom or truth, he has chosen the smaller evil of the two. I do not claim, of\ncourse, either for myself or for my fellow-workers, that we have always\nsacrificed as little as was possible of truth or idiom, and that here and\nthere a happier rendering of certain passages may not be suggested by those\nwho come after us. I only wish to warn the reader once more not to expect too\nmuch from a translation, and to bear in mind that, easy as it might be to\nrender word by word, it is difficult, aye, sometimes impossible, to render\nthought by thought.\n\nI shall give one instance only from my own translation of the Upanishads. One\nof the most important words in the ancient philosophy of the Brahmans is\n\xc3\x82tman, nom. sing. \xc3\x82tma. It is rendered in our dictionaries by 'breath, soul,\nthe principle of life and sensation, the individual soul, the self, the\nabstract individual, self, one's self, the reflexive pronoun, the natural\ntemperament -or disposition, essence, nature, character, peculiarity, the\nperson or the whole body, the body, the understanding, intellect, the mind,\nthe faculty of thought and reason, the thinking faculty, the highest principle\nof life, Brahma, the supreme deity or soul of the universe, care, effort,\npains, firmness, the Sun, fire, wind, air, a son.'\n\np. xxix\n\nThis will give classical scholars an idea of the chaotic state from which,\nthanks to the excellent work done by Boehtlingk, Roth, and others, Sanskrit\nlexicology is only just emerging. Some of the meanings here mentioned ought\ncertainly not to be ascribed to \xc3\x82tman. It never means, for instance, the\nunderstanding, nor could it ever by itself be translated by sun, fire, wind,\nair, pains or firmness. But after deducting such surplusage, there still\nremains a large variety of meanings which may, under certain circumstances, be\nascribed to \xc3\x82tman.\n\nWhen \xc3\x82tman occurs in philosophical treatises, such as the Upanishads and the\nVedanta system which is based on them, it has generally been translated by\nsoul, mind, or spirit. I tried myself to use one or other of these words, but\nthe oftener I employed them, the more I felt their inadequacy, and was driven\nat last to adopt self and Self as the least liable to misunderstanding.\n\nNo doubt in many passages it sounds strange in English to use self, and in the\nplural selfs instead of selves; but that very strangeness is useful, for while\nsuch words as soul and mind and spirit pass over us unrealised, self and selfs\nwill always ruffle the surface of the mind, and stir up some reflection in the\nreader. In English to speak even of the I and the Non-I, was till lately\nconsidered harsh; it may still be called a foreign philosophical idiom. In\nGerman the Ich and Nicht-ich have, since the time of Fichte, become recognised\nand almost familiar, not only as philosophical terms, but as legitimate\nexpressions in the literary language of the day. But while the Ich with Fichte\nexpressed the highest abstraction of personal existence, the\n\np. xxx\n\ncorresponding word in Sanskrit, the Aham or Aha\xe1\xb9\x85kara, was always looked upon\nas a secondary development only and as by no means free from all purely\nphenomenal ingredients. Beyond the Aham or Ego, with all its accidents and\nlimitations, such as sex, sense, language, country, and religion, the ancient\nsages of India perceived, from a very early time, the \xc3\x82tman or the self,\nindependent of all such accidents.\n\nThe individual atman or self, however, was with the Brahmans a phase or\nphenomenal modification only of the Highest Self, and that Highest Self was to\nthem the last point which could be reached by philosophical speculation. It\nwas to them what in other systems of philosophy has been called by various\nnames, \xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb8 \xe1\xbd\x84\xce\xbd, the Divine, the Absolute. The highest aim of all thought and\nstudy with the Brahman of the Upanishads was to recognise his own self as a\nmere limited reflection of the Highest Self, to know his self in the Highest\nSelf, and through that knowledge to return to it, and regain his identity with\nit. Here to know was to be, to know the \xc3\x82tman was to be the \xc3\x82tman, and the\nreward of that highest knowledge after death was freedom from new births, or\nimmortality.\n\nThat Highest Self which had become to the ancient Brahmans the goal of all\ntheir mental efforts, was looked upon at the same time as the starting-point\nof all phenomenal existence, the root of the world, the only thing that could\ntruly be said to be, to be real and true. As the root of all that exists, the\n\xc3\x82tman was identified with the Brahman, which in Sanskrit is both masculine and\nneuter, and with the Sat, which is neuter only, that which is,\n\np. xxxi\n\nor Satya, the true, the real. It alone exists in the beginning and for ever;\nit has no second. Whatever else is said to exist, derives its real being from\nthe Sat. How the one Sat became many, how what we call the creation, what they\ncall emanation (\xcf\x80\xcf\x81\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xbf\xce\xb4\xce\xbf\xcf\x82), constantly proceeds and returns to it, has been\nexplained in various more or less fanciful ways by ancient prophets and poets.\nBut what they all agree in is this, that the whole creation, the visible and\ninvisible world, all plants, all animals, all men are due to the one Sat, are\nupheld by it, and will return to it.\n\nIf we translate \xc3\x82tman by soul, mind, or spirit, we commit, first of all, that\nfundamental mistake of using words which may be predicated, in place of a word\nwhich is a subject only, and can never become a predicate. We may say in\nEnglish that man possesses a soul, that a man is out of his mind, that man has\nor even that man is a spirit, but we could never predicate \xc3\x82tman, or self, of\nanything else. Spirit, if it means breath or life; mind, if it means the organ\nof perception and conception; soul, if, like _k_ aitanya, it means\nintelligence in general, all these may be predicated of the \xc3\x82tman, as\nmanifested in the phenomenal world. But they are never subjects in the sense\nin which the \xc3\x82tman is; they have no independent being, apart from \xc3\x82tman. Thus\nto translate the beginning of the Aitareya-upanishad, \xc3\x82tma va idam eka evagra\nasit, by 'This (world) verily was before (the creation of the world) soul\nalone' (Roer); or, 'Originally this (universe) was indeed soul only'\n(Colebrooke), would give us a totally false idea. M. Regnaud in his 'Materiaux\npour servir a l'histoire de la philosophie\n\np. xxxii\n\nde l'Inde' (vol. ii, p. 24) has evidently felt this, and has kept the word\n\xc3\x82tman untranslated, 'Au commencement cet univers n'etait que l'atman.' But\nwhile in French it would seem impossible to find any equivalent for atman, I\nhave ventured to translate in English, as I should have done in German,\n'Verily, in the beginning all this was Self, one only.'\n\nThus again when we read in Sanskrit, 'Know the Self by the self,' atmanam\natmana pa _s_ ya, tempting as it may seem, it would be entirely wrong to\nrender it by the Greek \xce\xb3\xce\xbd\xe1\xbf\xb6\xce\xb8\xce\xb9 \xcf\x83\xce\xb5\xce\xb1\xcf\x85\xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xbd. The Brahman called upon his young pupil\nto know not himself, but his Self, that is, to know his individual self as a\nmerely temporary reflex of the Eternal Self. Were we to translate this so-\ncalled atmavidya, this self-knowledge, by knowledge of the soul, we should not\nbe altogether wrong, but we should nevertheless lose all that distinguishes\nIndian from Greek thought. It may not be good English to say to know his self,\nstill less to know our selfs, but it would be bad Sanskrit to say to know\nhimself, to know ourselves; or, at all events, such a rendering would deprive\nus of the greatest advantage in the study of Indian philosophy, the\nopportunity of seeing in how many different ways man has tried to solve the\nriddles of the world and of his soul.\n\nI have thought it best therefore to keep as close as possible to the Sanskrit\noriginal, and where I could not find an adequate term in English, I have often\nretained the Sanskrit word rather than use a misleading substitute in English.\nIt is impossible, for instance, to find an English equivalent for so simple a\nword as Sat, \xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb8 \xe1\xbd\x84\xce\xbd. We cannot render the Greek \xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb8 \xe1\xbd\x84\xce\xbd\n\np. xxxiii\n\nand \xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb8 \xce\xbc\xe1\xbd\xb4 \xe1\xbd\x84\xce\xbd by Being or Not-being, for both are abstract nouns; nor by 'the\nBeing,' for this would almost always convey a wrong impression. In German it\nis easy to distinguish between das Sein, i.e. being, in the abstract, and das\nSeiende, \xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb8 \xe1\xbd\x84\xce\xbd. In the same way the Sanskrit sat can easily be rendered in\nGreek by \xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb8 \xe1\xbd\x84\xce\xbd, in German by das Seiende, but in English, unless we say 'that\nwhich is,' we are driven to retain the original Sat.\n\nFrom this Sat was derived in Sanskrit Sat-ya, meaning originally 'endowed with\nbeing,' then 'true.' This is an adjective; but the same word, as a neuter, is\nalso used in the sense of truth, as an abstract; and in translating it is very\nnecessary always to distinguish between Satyam, the true, frequently the same\nas Sat, \xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb8 \xe1\xbd\x84\xce\xbd, and Satyam, truth, veracity. One example will suffice to show\nhow much the clearness of a translation depends on the right rendering of such\nwords as atman, sat, and satyam.\n\nIn a dialogue between Uddalaka and his son _S_ vetaketu, in which the father\ntries to open his son's mind, and to make him see man's true relation to the\nHighest Self ( _Kh_ andogya-upanishad VI), the father first explains how the\nSat produced what we should call the three elements  1, viz. fire, water, and\nearth, which he calls heat, water, and food. Having produced them (VI, 2, 4),\nthe Sat entered into them, but not with its real nature, but only with its\n'living self' (VI, 3, which is a reflection (abhasamatram) of the real Sat, as\nthe sun in the water is a reflection\n\np. xxxiv\n\nof the real sun. By this apparent union of the Sat with the three elements,\nevery form (rupa) and every name (naman) in the world was produced; and\ntherefore he who knows the three elements is supposed to know everything in\nthis world, nearly in the same manner in which the Greeks imagined that\nthrough a knowledge of the elements, everything else became known (VI, 4, 7).\nThe same three elements are shown to be also the constituent elements of man\n(VI, 5). Food or the earthy element is supposed to produce not only flesh, but\nalso mind; water, not only blood, but also breath; heat, not only bone, but\nalso speech. This is more or less fanciful; the important point, however, is\nthis, that, from the Brahmanic point of view, breath, speech, and mind are\npurely elemental, or external instruments, and require the support of the\nliving self, the _g_ ivatman, before they can act.\n\nHaving explained how the Sat produces progressively heat, how heat leads to\nwater, water to earth, and how, by a peculiar mixture of the three, speech,\nbreath, and mind are produced, the teacher afterwards shows how in death,\nspeech returns to mind, mind to breath, breath to heat, and heat to the Sat\n(VI, 8, 6). This Sat, the root of everything, is called para devata, the\nhighest deity, not in the ordinary sense of the word deity, but as expressing\nthe highest abstraction of the human mind. We must therefore translate it by\nthe Highest Being, in the same manner as we translate devata, when applied to\nheat, water, and earth, not by deity, but by substance or element.\n\nThe same Sat, as the root or highest essence of all material existence, is\ncalled a _n_ iman, from\n\np. xxxv\n\na _n_ u, small, subtile, infinitesimal, atom. It is an abstract word, and I\nhave translated it by subtile essence.\n\nThe father then goes on explaining in various ways that this Sat is underlying\nall existence, and that we must learn to recognise it as the root, not only of\nall the objective, but likewise of our own subjective existence. 'Bring the\nfruit of a Nyagrodha tree,' he says, 'break it, and what do you find?' 'The\nseeds,' the son replies, 'almost infinitesimal.' 'Break one of them, and tell\nme what you see.' 'Nothing,' the son replies. Then the father continues: 'My\nson, that subtile essence which you do not see there, of that very essence\nthis great Nyagrodha tree exists.'\n\nAfter that follows this sentence: 'Etadatmyam ida _m_ sarvam, tat satyam, sa\natma, tat tvam asi _S_ vetaketu.'\n\nThis sentence has been rendered by Rajendralal Mitra in the following way:\n'All this universe has the (Supreme) Deity for its life. That Deity is Truth.\nHe is the Universal Soul. Thou art He, O Svetaketu 1.'\n\nThis translation is quite correct, as far as the words go, but I doubt whether\nwe can connect any definite thoughts with these words. In spite of the\ndivision adopted in the text, I believe it will be necessary to join this\nsentence with the last words of the preceding paragraph. This is clear from\nthe commentary, and from later paragraphs, where this sentence is repeated,\nVI, 9, 4, &c. The division\n\np. xxxvi\n\nin the printed text (VI, 8, 6) is wrong, and VI, 8, 7 should begin with sa ya\nesho ' _n_ ima, i. e. that which is the subtile essence.\n\nThe question then is, what is further to be said about this subtile essence. I\nhave ventured to translate the passage in the following way:\n\n'That which is the subtile essence (the Sat, the root of everything), in it\nall that exists has its self, or more literally, its self-hood. It is the True\n(not the Truth in the abstract, but that which truly and really exists). It is\nthe Self, i. e. the Sat is what is called the Self of everything 1.' Lastly,\nhe sums up, and tells Svetaketu that, not only the whole world, but he too\nhimself is that Self, that Satya, that Sat.\n\nNo doubt this translation sounds strange to English ears, but as the thoughts\ncontained in the Upanishads are strange, it would be wrong to smoothe down\ntheir strangeness by clothing them in language familiar to us, which, because\nit is familiar, will fail to startle us, and because it fails to startle us,\nwill fail also to set us thinking.\n\nTo know oneself to be the Sat, to know that all that is real and eternal in us\nis the Sat, that all came from it and will, through knowledge, return to it,\nrequires an independent effort of speculative thought. We must realise, as\nwell as we can, the thoughts of the ancient Rishis, before we can hope to\ntranslate them. It is not enough simply to read the half-religious, half-\nphilosophical utterances which we find in\n\np. xxxvii\n\nthe Sacred Books of the East, and to say that they are strange, or obscure, or\nmystic. Plato is strange, till we know him; Berkeley is mystic, till for a\ntime we have identified ourselves with him. So it is with these ancient sages,\nwho have become the founders of the great religions of antiquity. They can\nnever be judged from without, they must be judged from within. We need not\nbecome Brahmans or Buddhists or Taosze altogether, but we must for a time, if\nwe wish to understand, and still more, if we are bold enough to undertake to\ntranslate their doctrines. Whoever shrinks from that effort, will see hardly\nanything in these sacred books or their translations but matter to wonder at\nor to laugh at; possibly something to make him thankful that he is not as\nother men. But to the patient reader these same books will, in spite of many\ndrawbacks, open a new view of the history of the human race, of that one race\nto which we all belong, with all the fibres of our flesh, with all the fears\nand hopes of our soul. We cannot separate ourselves from those who believed in\nthese sacred books. There is no specific difference between ourselves and the\nBrahmans, the Buddhists, the Zoroastrians, or the Taosze. Our powers of\nperceiving, of reasoning, and of believing may be more highly developed, but\nwe cannot claim the possession of any verifying power or of any power of\nbelief which they did not possess as well. Shall we say then that they were\nforsaken of God, while we are His chosen people? God forbid! There is much, no\ndoubt, in their sacred books which we should tolerate no longer, though we\nmust not forget that there are portions in our own sacred books, too, which\nmany of us would wish to be absent,\n\np. xxxviii\n\nwhich, from the earliest ages of Christianity, have been regretted by\ntheologians of undoubted piety, and which often prove a stumbling block to\nthose who have been won over by our missionaries to the simple faith of\nChrist. But that is not the question. The question is, whether there is or\nwhether there is not, hidden in every one of the sacred books, something that\ncould lift up the human heart from this earth to a higher world, something\nthat could make man feel the omnipresence of a higher Power, something that\ncould make him shrink from evil and incline to good, something to sustain him\nin the short journey through life, with its bright moments of happiness, and\nits long hours of terrible distress.\n\nIf some of those who read and mark these translations learn how to discover\nsome such precious grains in the sacred books of other nations, though hidden\nunder heaps of rubbish, our labour will not have been in vain, for there is no\nlesson which at the present time seems more important than to learn that in\nevery religion there are such precious grains; that we must draw in every\nreligion a broad distinction between what is essential and what is not,\nbetween the eternal and the temporary, between the divine and the human; and\nthat though the non-essential may fill many volumes, the essential can often\nbe comprehended in a few words, but words on which 'hang all the law and the\nprophets.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xiii:1](sbe01002.htm#fr_0) Bishop Callaway, Unkulunkulu, or the Tradition of\nCreation, as existing among the Amazulu and other tribes of South Africa, p.\n7.\n\n[xvii:1](sbe01002.htm#fr_1) Colebrooke's Miscellaneous Essays, 1873, vol. ii,\np. 102.\n\n[xviii:1](sbe01002.htm#fr_2) Sir W.
