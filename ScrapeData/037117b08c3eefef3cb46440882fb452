For the same reasons (the Vai _s_ vanara) cannot be the divinity (of\nfire), or the element (of fire).\n\nThe averment that the fanciful attribution of members contained in the passage\n'His head is Sute _g_ as,' &c. may apply to the elemental fire also which from\nthe mantras is seen to be connected with the heavenly world, &c., or else to\nthe divinity whose body is fire, on account of its power, is refuted by the\nfollowing remark: For the reasons\n\np. 149\n\nalready stated Vai _s_ vanara is neither the divinity nor the element. For to\nthe elemental fire which is mere heat and light the heavenly world and so on\ncannot properly be ascribed as head and so on, because an effect cannot be the\nSelf of another effect.--Again, the heavenly world cannot be ascribed as head,\n&c. to the divinity of fire, in spite of the power of the latter; for, on the\none hand, it is not a cause (but a mere effect), and on the other hand its\npower depends on the highest Lord. Against all these interpretations there\nlies moreover the objection founded on the inapplicability of the term 'Self.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2, 28](sbe34065.htm)\n\n"
