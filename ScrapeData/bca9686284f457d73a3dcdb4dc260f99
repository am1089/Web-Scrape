Let a man meditate on the sevenfold Saman as the sun. The sun is Saman,\nbecause he is always the same (sama); he is Saman because he is the same,\neverybody thinking he looks towards me, he looks towards me 2.\n\n2\\. Let him know that all beings are dependent on him (the sun). What he is\nbefore his rising, that is the hi\xe1\xb9\x85kara. On it animals are dependent. Therefore\nanimals say hi\xe1\xb9\x85 (before sunrise), for they share the hi\xe1\xb9\x85kara of that Saman\n(the sun).\n\n3\\. What he is when first risen, that is the prastava. On it men are\ndependent. Therefore men love praise (prastuti) and celebrity, for they share\nthe prastava of that Saman.\n\np. 27\n\n4\\. What he is at the time of the sa\xe1\xb9\x85gava 1, that is the adi, the first, the\nOm. On it birds are dependent. Therefore birds fly about in the sky without\nsupport, holding themselves, for they share the adi 2 (the Om) of that Saman.\n\n5\\. What he is just at noon, that is the udgitha. On it the Devas are\ndependent (because they are brilliant). Therefore they are the best of all the\ndescendants of Pra _g_ apati, for they share the udgitha of that Saman.\n\n6\\. What he is after midday and before afternoon, that is the pratihara. On it\nall germs are dependent. Therefore these, having been conceived (pratih _ri_\nta), do not fall, for they share the pratihara of that Saman.\n\n7\\. What he is after the afternoon and before sunset, that is the upadrava. On\nit the animals of the forest are dependent. Therefore, when they see a man,\nthey run (upadravanti) to the forest as a safe hiding-place, for they share\nthe upadrava of that Saman.\n\n8\\. What he is when he first sets, that is the nidhana. On it the fathers are\ndependent. Therefore they put them 3 down (nidadhati), for they share the\nnidhana of that Saman. Thus a man meditates on the sevenfold Saman as the sun.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[26:2](sbe01043.htm#fr_134) Cf. _Kh_. Up. II, 2, 2.
