And common (to him who knows and him who does not know) (is the departure)\nup to the beginning of the way; and the immortality (of him who knows) (is\nrelative only) without having burned (nescience and so on).\n\nThe question here arises whether the departure of the soul, as described\nhitherto, is the same in the case of him who knows and him who is destitute of\nknowledge; or whether there is any difference.--There is a difference, the\npurvapakshin maintains. For the departure as described has for its abode the\nelements, and this abiding in the elements is for the purpose of a new birth.\nBut he who possesses true knowledge cannot be born again, since scripture\ndeclares that 'He who knows reaches immortality.' Hence only he who is devoid\nof knowledge departs in the way described.--But as that departure is described\nin chapters treating of knowledge it can belong only to him\n\np. 370\n\nwho knows!--Not so, the purvapakshin replies. In the same way as sleep and the\nlike, the departure of the soul is only referred to in the texts as something\nestablished elsewhere (not as something to be taught as part of true\nknowledge). Passages such as 'When a man sleeps,--is hungry,--is thirsty' (\n_Kh_. Up. VI, 8), although forming part of chapters concerned with true\nknowledge, mention sleep and so on which are common to all living beings,\nbecause they assist the comprehension of the matter to be taught, but do not\naim at enjoining them specially for those who know. Analogously the texts\nabout the soul's departure refer to that departure only in order to teach that\n'that highest deity in which the heat of the dying man is merged, that is the\nSelf, that art thou.' Now that departure is (in other scriptural passages)\nspecially denied of him who knows; it therefore belongs to him only who does\nnot know.\n\nTo this we make the following reply. That departure which is described in the\npassage, 'speech is merged in mind,' &c., must be 'common' to him who knows\nand him who does not know 'up to the beginning of the way;' because scripture\nrecords no distinction. The soul destitute of true knowledge having taken its\nabode in the subtle elements which constitute the seed of the body and being\nimpelled by its works, migrates into a new body; while the soul of him who\nknows passes into the vein, revealed by true knowledge, which is the door of\nrelease. In this sense the Sutra says 'up to the beginning of the way.'--But\nhe who knows reaches immortality, and immortality does not depend on a change\nof place; why then should the soul take its abode in the elements or set out\non a journey?--That immortality, we reply, is 'without having burned.' i.e.\nfor him who, without having altogether burned nescience and the other\nafflictions, is about to obtain, through the power of the lower knowledge, a\nrelative immortality only, there take place the entering on the way and the\nabiding in the elements. For without a substratum the pra _n_ as could not\nmove. There is thus no difficulty.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 2, 8](sbe38288.htm)\n\n"
