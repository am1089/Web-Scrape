Now, when Indra's energies, or vital powers, departed from him,\nthe gods restored them by means of this very sacrifice. Both cups of milk and\ncups of Sura-liquor are filled: they thereby restore to him his energies, or\nvital powers. On the northern fire they offer (from) the cups of milk, and\nthereby provide him 1 with the bright liquor, with the Soma-drink.\n\n12:8:1:22\\. He (the Adhvaryu) offers (of the three cups of milk) with (Va _g_.\nS. XIX, 32), 'By their devotions the buffalos quicken the sacrifice,'--the\nbuffalos, doubtless, are the officiating priests, and devotion is sacrifice:\nthrough the priests he causes the sacrifice to prosper, and through the\nsacrifice the sacrificer 2;--'the barhis-seated one, supplied with Sura and\ngoodly heroes,' supplied with Sura, indeed, is this barhis-seated sacrifice,\nto wit, the Sautrama _n_ i: by means of the barhis (the sacred grass on the\nVedi), and the sacrifice, he causes him to prosper;--'they who bestow Soma,'--\nthey thus bestow the Soma-drink upon him;--'with the deities in heaven,'--they\nthus place him with the deities in heaven;--'may we enjoy ourselves,'--the\nSoma-juice, indeed, conduces\n\np. 232\n\nto joy, and so does the Sura-liquor: both the joy of Soma and the joy of Sura\nhe thus secures;--'worshipping Indra with good hymns of praise!'--for the hymn\nof praise is food for the gods, and the sacrifice also is food: by sacrifice,\nby food, he thus makes him successful. Having sacrificed, they drink (of the\nmilk), and thereby increase what is prosperous with him.\n\n12:8:1:33\\. He drinks 1 with (Va _g_. S. XIX, 34), 'The (Soma) which the A _s_\nvins (brought away) from Namu _k_ i, the Asura,'--for the two A _s_ vins\nindeed brought away that (Soma juice) from Namu _k_ i;--'and Sarasvati\ndistilled for the sake of Indra's strength,'--for Sarasvati indeed distilled\nit for the sake of Indra's strength;--'that clear, sweet draught,'--for clear\nand sweet indeed is that draught, Soma;--'King Soma I now drink,'--it is thus\nking Soma that comes to be drunk by him. The cups of Sura-liquor they offer\n(from) on the southern fire 2, and thereby keep him (the Sacrificer) from evil\n3.\n\n12:8:1:44\\. He (the Pratiprasthat _ri_ ) offers (libations from the cups of\nSura-liquor 4), with (Va _g_. S. XIX, 33), 'What essence there is of thine,\ngathered from the plants,' for this Sura-liquor, indeed, is the essence\n\np. 233\n\nof both the waters and the plants: by the essence of both the waters and the\nplants he thus causes him to prosper;--'the strength of the Soma-juice\ntogether with the Sura-liquor,'--he thereby secures what strength there is in\nthe Soma-juice and in the Sura-liquor;--'by that exhilarating drink quicken\nthou the Sacrificer,'--that is, 'by that exhilarating drink gladden thou the\nSacrificer;'--'Sarasvati, the A _s_ vins, Indra, and Agni,'--by deities he\n(the priest) thus causes the sacrifice to prosper, and by deities and\nsacrifice the Sacrificer. Having made the offering, they drink (the liquor),\nand thereby cause to prosper what is unprosperous with him.\n\n12:8:1:55\\. He drinks, with (Va _g_. S. XIX, 35), 'Whatever is mingled\nherewith of the juicy Soma,'--he thereby secures for him the essence (juice)\nof the effused (extracted) and the infused 1 (Soma);--'which Indra drank with\neagerness,'--for Indra, indeed, drank it with eagerness;--'that (essence)\nthereof (I drink) with propitious mind,'--for unpropitious, as it were, to a\nBrahma _n_ a is that drink, the Sura-liquor: having thus made it propitious,\nhe takes it to himself;--'King Soma I drink,'--it is thus king Soma that comes\nto be drunk by him.\n\n12:8:1:66\\. Here, now, other Adhvaryus hire some Ra _g_ anya or Vai _s_ ya\nwith the view that he shall drink that (liquor); but let him not do this; for,\nindeed, this Soma-drink falls to the share of the fathers and grandfathers of\nwhoever drinks (the liquor 2) on\n\np. 234\n\nthis occasion. Having shifted three coals of the southern fire to outside the\nenclosing-stones 1, he may there offer (of the liquor) with these (three)\nutterances (Va _g_. S. XIX, 36):--\n\n12:8:1:77\\. 'To the Svadha-loving Fathers be Svadha, adoration!' he thereby\nplaces the Fathers with the Svadha in the world of the Fathers.--'To the\nSvadha-loving grandfathers he Svadha, adoration!' he thereby places the\ngrandfathers with the Svadha in the world of the grandfathers.--'To the\nSvadha-loving great-grandfathers be Svadha, adoration!' he thereby places the\ngreat-grandfathers with the Svadha in the world of the great-grandfathers.\n\n12:8:1:88\\. Having fetched water, he pours it (into the cups) with, 'The\nFathers have drunk:' he thereby bestows food on them;--'the Fathers have\nenjoyed themselves:' he thereby causes them to enjoy themselves;--'the Fathers\nhave become satisfied:' he thereby satisfies them;--'may the Fathers cleanse\nthemselves!' he thereby purifies all of them from the first downwards, for the\nSautrama _n_ i is a means of purification 2.\n\np. 235\n\n12:8:1:99\\. By three implements of purification he purifies,--three in number\nare these worlds: by means of these worlds he thus purifies him.\n\n12:8:1:1010\\. With 'pavamani 1 (verses)' they purify; for pavamanis are a\nmeans of purification: by a means of purification they thus purify him.\n\n12:8:1:1111\\. With three (verses) they purify each time,--there are three\nvital airs, the in-breathing, the up-breathing, and the through-breathing: it\nis by means of these that they purify him.\n\n12:8:1:1212\\. With nine (verses) they purify,--there are nine vital airs: by\nmeans of the vital airs they purify him, and when purified they establish him\nagain in the vital airs.\n\n12:8:1:1313\\. They purify by means of a (goat's hair and sheep's wool)\nstrainer,--such a strainer doubtless is a form (symbol) of goats and sheep: by\nmeans of goats and sheep they thus purify him.\n\n12:8:1:1414\\. They purify by means of a tail-whisk,--such a tail-whisk\ndoubtless is a form of kine and horses: with kine and horses they thus purify\nhim.\n\np. 236\n\n12:8:1:1515\\. They purify by means of gold,--that (metal), to wit, gold,\ndoubtless is a form of the gods: by means of a form of the gods they thus\npurify him.\n\n12:8:1:1616\\. They purify him by means of Sura-liquor, for the Sura is\npurified: they thus purify him by that which is purified; and even as the\nliquor, whilst being purified, is cleared of impure matter 1, so is that\nSacrificer thereby freed from all evil who, knowing this, performs the\nSautrama _n_ i, or who even knows this.\n\n12:8:1:1717\\. Here, now, they ask, 'Is the Sautrama _n_ i to be performed, or\nis it not to be performed, seeing that (in any case) they continuously repel\nfrom him all evil?' As to this Revottaras Sthapati Pa _t_ ava Kakra once said,\n'Even after making the surrender, one ought certainly to perform the\nsacrifice; for the Sacrificer is the body of the sacrifice, and the\nofficiating priests are its limbs; and wherever the body is pure there the\nlimbs also are pure; both of them, indeed, purify him, and both of them repel\nthe evil from him: therefore even after making the surrender (of one's own\nself) one ought certainly to sacrifice.'\n\n12:8:1:1818\\. But, indeed, those who perform at the southern fire, go down to\nthe world of the Fathers. He offers an oblation of ghee: ghee being (material\nof) sacrifice, it is by sacrifice that they establish themselves in the\nsacrifice.\n\n12:8:1:1919\\. He (the Sacrificer) offers, with (Va _g_. S. XIX, 45), 'The\nFathers who, one in form and one in mind, live in Yama's realm,--may their\nworld,\n\np. 237\n\nthe Svadha, adoration, and sacrifice prosper among the gods!' he thereby\ncommits the Fathers to Yama, and he also conquers the world of the Fathers.\nHaving, all of them, invested themselves sacrificially 1, they betake\nthemselves to the northern fire, for the northern fire 2 is this (terrestrial)\nworld 3: they thus establish themselves in this world. He offers an oblation\nof ghee: ghee being sacrifice, it is from out of the sacrifice that they\nestablish themselves in the sacrifice.\n\n12:8:1:2020\\. He (the Sacrificer) offers, with (Va _g_. S. XIX, 46), 'Mine own\n(people) who are one in form and one in mind, living among the living,--may\ntheir fortune prosper with me, in this world, for a hundred years!' he thereby\nsecures the good fortune of his own people, and he also confers long life on\nthem. Whilst they hold on to each other, he (the Adhvaryu) offers milk, for\nmilk is vital air and food: in the vital air, in food, they thus finally\nestablish themselves.\n\n12:8:1:2121\\. He offers, with (Va _g_. S. XIX, 47), 'Two paths for mortals\nhave I heard of, (that of the Fathers and that of the gods 4),'--'two paths\n\np. 238\n\nindeed there are,' they say, 'those of the gods and of the Fathers,'--'thereon\nall that liveth here passeth,' for thereon, indeed, everything living here\npasses;--'what there is between the father and the mother,'--the father,\ndoubtless, is yonder (sky), and the mother is this (earth): by means of these\ntwo he leads the Fathers to the world of heaven. He (the Sacrificer) alone\ndrinks what is left from the offering 1: to himself alone he thus takes\nprosperity, for milk is prosperity.\n\n12:8:1:2222\\. He drinks it, with (Va _g_. S. XIX, 48), 'May this oblation be\nproductive for me,'--for productive indeed it is, whether it be milk or\nSoma;--'possessed of ten heroes,'--the ten heroes, doubtless, are the vital\nairs: vital airs he thus takes to himself;--'possessed of all the troops,'--\nall the troops, doubtless, are the limbs: it is limbs he thus takes to\nhimself;--'for well-being: breath-winning,'--the breath of life he thus\nwins;--'race-winning,'--a race (offspring) he thus wins;--'cattle-winning,'--\ncattle he thus wins;--'place-winning'--for it is for a place (in heaven) that\nhe sacrifices: it is that he gains;--'safety-winning,'--the (place of) safety,\ndoubtless, is the heavenly world: in the heavenly world he thus finally\nestablishes himself;--'May Agni raise for me abundant offspring,\n\np. 239\n\nand bestow ye upon us food, milk, and seed!' it is to those (priests) who\noffer for him that he thus says, 'Bestow ye all this upon me!' By means of\ngold they cleanse themselves 1; for gold is immortal life: in immortal life\nthey thus finally establish themselves.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[231:1](sbe44068.htm#fr_593) Or, cause him to prosper, render him successful\nby means of the liquor; MS. I. O. 311 reads 'samardhayanti.'\n\n[231:2](sbe44068.htm#fr_594) Or, perhaps, he provides the sacrifice with\npriests, and the Sacrificer with sacrifice. For obvious reasons the first two\npadas of the verse have been transposed in the translation.\n\n[232:1](sbe44068.htm#fr_595) For particulars as to the persons who partake of\nthe respective cups of milk and Sura-liquor, see [XII, 8, 2,\n22](sbe44069.htm#12:8:2:22) seqq.\n\n[232:2](sbe44068.htm#fr_596) That is, on the fire of the southern of the two\nspecial Vedis, see [p. 225](sbe44067.htm#page_225), note.\n\n[232:3](sbe44068.htm#fr_597) Viz. inasmuch as the libations of liquor are not\nmade on the offering-fire proper, the (northern) \xc3\x82havaniya, where the\noblations from the cups of milk are made.\n\n[232:4](sbe44068.htm#fr_598) These cups are of the same kind as those used for\nthe draughts of Soma, being made of pala _s_ a-wood, and resembling mortars in\nshape; cf. part ii, p. 259, note 1, towards the end.\n\n[233:1](sbe44068.htm#fr_599) For the distinction between 'suta' and 'asuta'\n(not 'asuta'), cf. [XII, 8, 2, 12](sbe44069.htm#12:8:2:12).\n\n[233:2](sbe44068.htm#fr_600) According to Katy. _S_ r. XIX, 3, 15, some\nauthorities, however, p. 234 think the inhaling of the fumes of the liquor to\nbe sufficient for this purpose.\n\n[234:1](sbe44068.htm#fr_601) The coals are to be placed on the south side of\nthe southern fire, from north to south, and the libation from the \xc3\x82 _s_ vina\ncup is made on the northernmost coal, that from the Sarasvata cup on the\ncentral one, and that from the Aindra cup on the southern one. According to\nKaty. XIX, 3, 17, and Mahidhara on Va _g_. S. XIX, 36, this is a fourth\nalternative of disposing of the liquor (in favour of the Fathers), the others\nbeing actual drinking, or smelling it, or hiring some one to drink it.\n\n[234:2](sbe44068.htm#fr_602) At [XII, 7, 2, 13](sbe44066.htm#12:7:2:13) a\nperforated pot (with a hundred holes) was mentioned as being used at this\nsacrifice. According to Katy. _S_ r. p. 235 XIX, 3, 20, and Mahidhara on Va\n_g_. S. XIX, 37, use is made of this pot at this juncture in much the same way\nas is described in V, 5, 4, 27 seqq.; viz. two poles are driven into the\nground north and south of the southern fire, and a bamboo stick laid thereon:\non a string fastened to this stick the pot, containing a tail-whisk (for\nstraining) and a piece of gold, is then made to hang over the fire, and the\nremains of the Sura-liquor poured into it; and whilst it trickles through into\nthe fire, the priest makes the Sacrificer pronounce the verses Va _g_. S. XIX,\n37-44, 52-60, addressed to the different kinds of departed ancestors.\n\n[235:1](sbe44068.htm#fr_603) That is, verses recited at the Soma-sacrifice\nwhilst the Soma-juice is clarifying; the term being usually confined to the\nverses of hymns of the ninth ma _n_ _d_ ala of the _Ri_ ksa _m_ hita, whence\nindeed most of the verses used on this occasion (Va _g_. S. XIX, 37-44) are\ntaken.\n\n[236:1](sbe44068.htm#fr_604) The term 'balkasa' (apparently connected with\n'valkala') would seem to mean vegetable matter, esp. chaff or husks. The comm.\nexplains it by 'kidisa' (? kilbisha or kiknasa).\n\n[237:1](sbe44068.htm#fr_605) That is, by shifting their Brahma _n_ ical cord\nso as to hang across the breast from the left shoulder to the right hip.\n\n[237:2](sbe44068.htm#fr_606) That is, the fire on the uttara-vedi of the\nnorthern of the two special Vedis, see [p. 225](sbe44067.htm#page_225), note.\n\n[237:3](sbe44068.htm#fr_607) They are supposed to return to the earth from the\nworld of the Fathers below.\n\n[237:4](sbe44068.htm#fr_608) Not only is the second pada of the verse omitted\nhere (as also in MS. I. O. 311), but the construction of the first half of the\nverse is also rather peculiar, the most natural rendering being, 'Two paths of\nthe Fathers have I heard of, (those) of the gods and of men.' The same verse\noccurs _Ri_ ks. X, 88, 15 (with the reading 'dve sruti' instead of 'dve s _ri_\nti'), where Grassmann translates,--p. 238 'Two paths there are, so the Fathers\nhave told me, passable for gods and men;' whilst Ludwig takes it in the way\njust referred to. The above interpretation is that of Mahidhara, who refers to\n_S_ at.-Br. I, 9, 2, 3; whilst Saya _n_ a (on Riks.) seems to take the two\npaths to be that of the Fathers and gods, and that of men (pit _r i_ _n_ a _m_\ndevana _m_ _k_ otapi martyana _m_ _k_ a dve sruti dvau margau); though he\nafterwards calls them 'devayana' and 'pit _ri_ ya _n_ a.'\n\n[238:1](sbe44068.htm#fr_609) That is to say, the milk which remains in the pot\n(ukha), from which the milk used for the oblation was taken.\n\n[239:1](sbe44068.htm#fr_610) Katy. _S_ r. XIX, 3, 27, 'Over the _k_ atvala\n(pit) they cleanse themselves, with their wives, putting gold between;' that\nis to say, whilst the water is poured on their hands a piece of gold is held\nbetween, over which the water flows.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XII, 8, 2.
