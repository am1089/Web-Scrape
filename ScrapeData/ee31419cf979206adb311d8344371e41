May glory come to both of us (teacher and pupil) together! May Vedic light\nbelong to both of us!\n\nNow let us explain the Upanishad (the secret meaning) of the union (sa _m_\nhita) 2, under five heads, with regard to the worlds, the heavenly lights,\nknowledge, offspring, and self (body). People call these the great Sa _m_\nhitas.\n\nFirst, with regard to the worlds. The earth is the former element, heaven the\nlatter, ether their union;\n\n2\\. That union takes place through Vayu (air). So much with regard to the\nworlds.\n\nNext, with regard to the heavenly lights. Agni (fire) is the former element,\n\xc3\x82ditya (the sun) the latter, water their union. That union takes place through\nlightning. So much with regard to the heavenly lights.\n\nNext, with regard to knowledge. The teacher is the former element,\n\nThe pupil the latter, knowledge their union. That union takes place through\nthe recitation of the Veda. So much with regard to knowledge.\n\nNext, with regard to offspring. The mother is\n\np. 47\n\nthe former element, the father the latter, offspring their union. That union\ntakes place through procreation. So much with regard to offspring.\n\n4\\. Next, with regard to the self (body). The lower jaw is the former element,\nthe upper jaw the latter, speech their union. That union takes place through\nspeech. So much with regard to the Self. These are the great Sa _m_ hitas. He\nwho knows these Sa _m_ hitas (unions), as here explained, becomes united with\noffspring, cattle, Vedic light, food, and with the heavenly world.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[46:2](sbe15024.htm#fr_200) Cf.
