This chapter opens the section on _S_\nraddhas (funeral oblations), which consists of thirteen chapters (LXXIII-\nLXXXV. Nand.)\n\n1\\. The Ekoddish _t_ a and Sapi _nd_ ikara _n_ a _S_ raddhas have been\ndescribed above, XXI.

The great majority of\nthe Mantras quoted in Sutras 11-26 have {footnote p. 233} not been traced in\nthe Berlin US. of the Ka _th_ aka, nor indeed in any other Sa _m_ hita of the\nVeda, but there can be no doubt that they, belong, to the school of the Ka\n_th_ as, as nearly all are quoted by their Pratikas in the Ka _th_ aka G _ri_\nhya-sutra, and given at full in Devapala\'s Commentary on the latter. The above\nrenderings of the Pratikas rest upon Devapala\'s interpretations. That the\nrules in 5 seq. teach the performance of a _S_ raddha according to the rites\nof the Ka _th_ a school, is confirmed by Nand. in his remarks on 5 seq. and 9\nseq.]\n\np. 233\n\nof undressed grain or performed for the gratification of a special desire[1];\n\n6\\.

The Yatudhanas are a class of demons supposed to disturb {footnote p.\n234} the effect of a _S_ raddha.

He must invite the manes (with the four Mantras), \'Come near, O ye\nmanes,\' \'(Conduct) them all (here), O Agni,\' \'May my (ancestors) come near,\'\n\'This is your (share), O ye manes.\' Then let him prepare the water for washing\nthe feet with scented water, which has been mixed up with Kusa grass and\nsesamum, while reciting (the three Mantras), \'Those standing[1],\' \'Speech is\nimperishable,\' and \'What my mother (has sinned)[1],\' and offer it (to the\nBrahma _n_ as); let him prepare the Arghya (or water mixed with Durva grass,\nflowers, &c.) and offer it to them; let him offer to the Brahma _n_ as, to the\nbest of his power, Ku _s_ a grass, sesamum, clothes, flowers, ornaments,\nincense, and lamps; let him take food sprinkled with clarified butter; let him\nlook them in the face with the Mantra, \'O ye \xc3\x82dityas, Rudras, and Vasus;\' let\nhim say, \'I will offer an oblation in the fire,\' and if the Brahma _n_ as say,\n\'Offer an oblation,\' let him offer three burnt-oblations[2].\'\n\n13\\. After having consecrated the offerings with the Mantras, \'They, who are\nmy ancestors,\' \'This is your (share), O ye manes,\' and \'This offering,\' he\nmust pour (what is left of) the food into such vessels as happen to be there,\nor (into golden ones at the offering addressed to the Vi _s_ vedevas and) into\nsilver\n\n[12. 1 These two Mantras are also quoted, with slight variations, by _S_ a _n_\nkhayana III, 13, 5.--2 The three burnt-oblations have to be accompanied by the\nrecitation of the three Mantras, \'To Soma accompanied by the manes svadha nama\n_h_ ; to Yama A _n_ giras svadha nama _h_ ; to Agni who takes the offerings\naddressed to the manes svadha nama _h_.\' (Nand.)]\n\np. 235\n\nones (at the offering addressed to the manes), and offer it first to the two\nBrahma _n_ as facing the east (who have been invited to the _S_ raddha of the\ngods).\n\n14\\. Afterwards he must offer it to the (three) Brahma _n_ as facing north\n(who represent his three ancestors, addressing himself) to his father,\ngrandfather and great-grandfather, (and calling out) their name and race.\n\n15\\. While the Brahma _n_ as are eating the food, let him mutter (the three\nMantras), \'Whatever (trickles down) through my fault,\' \'With days and\nnights[1],\' and \'Whatever (limb) of yours, Agni.\'\n\n16\\. And (let him mutter) the Itihasa (Epics), Pura _n_ a (Legends), and the\nDharma _s_ astra (Institutes of the Sacred Law).\n\n17\\. Near the leavings let him deposit upon blades of Ku _s_ a grass with the\nends turned towards the south one ball of rice for his father, while saying,\n\'Earth is (like) a spoon, imperishable (satisfaction).\'\n\n18\\. With the Mantra, \'Air is (like) a spoon, imperishable (satisfaction,\' let\nhim deposit) a second ball for his grandfather.\n\n19\\. With the Mantra, \'Heaven is (like) a spoon, imperishable (satisfaction,\'\nlet him deposit) a third ball for his great-grandfather.\n\n20\\. With the Mantra, \'Those ancestors who\n\n[14. The formula of this invocation, according to Nand., is this, \'To NN., my\nancestor, of the Gotra NN., who is like a Vasu, (I offer) this food, svadha\nnama _h_.\' The use of the particle _k_ a, according to the same, implies that\nthe maternal grandfather and the other maternal ancestors must also be\naddressed as ordained below (LXXV, 7).\n\n15\\. 1 A similar Mantra is quoted, _S_ a _n_ kh, III, 13, 5.]\n\np. 236\n\nhave died,\' let him place a garment (upon the balls).\n\n21\\. With the Mantra, \'Give us sons, O ye manes,\' (let him place) food upon\nthem.\n\n22\\. With the Mantra, \'Enjoy it, O ye manes, partake of it, (each according to\nhis share[1],\' let him wipe off the grease from his hands with the ends of the\nblades.\n\n23, With the Mantra, \'(Ye waters) imparting vigour[1],\' let him sprinkle the\nballs to the right with the wet (remainder of the food), and offer the\nArgha[2], flowers, incense, unguents, and rice, and other victuals and\ndainties to the Brahma _n_ as.\n\n24\\. And (he must offer them, ) a jar with water, which has been mixed up with\nhoney, clarified butter, sesamum, and (ointments, oil, and the like).\n\n25\\. The Brahma _n_ as having eaten and being satisfied, let him sprinkle the\nfood (as much as has been left by them) and the grass with the Mantra, \'Mayest\nthou not fail me,\' and strew the food near the leavings; and having asked\nthem, \'Are you satisfied? Is (the _S_ raddha) finished,\' he must first give\nwater for sipping to the Brahma _n_ as facing the north, and then to those\nfacing the east; and he must sprinkle the place where the _S_ raddha has been\noffered (with water, with the Mantra), \'Well sprinkled.\' All these rites he\nmust perform while holding blades of sacred grass in his hand.\n\n26\\. Afterwards he must, while turning his face towards the Brahma _n_ as\nfacing the east, circumambulate\n\n[22. 1 Va _g_ asan. Sa _m_ h. II, 31; Ka _th_. IX, 6.\n\n23\\. 1 Va _g_ asan. Sa _m_ h.

After having given (to all) water (with the Mantra, \'May the food and\nwater and whatever else I gave you be) imperishable,\' (and calling out their\nname and race, and having added the Mantra, \'May the Vi _s_ vedevas be\nsatisfied,\' he must ask, with folded hands, and with an attentive and cheerful\nmind, the following (benediction) from the Brahma _n_ as facing the east:\n\n28\\. \'May the liberal-minded in our race increase in number, and may the\n(study of the) Vedas and our progeny (also increase). May faith not depart\nfrom us, and may we have plenty to bestow on the poor.\n\n29\\. They shall answer, \'Thus let it be.\'\n\n30\\. (The second half of the benediction shall be, as follows), "May we have\nplenty of food, and may we receive guests. May others come to beg of us, and\nmay not we be obliged to beg of any one.\'\n\n31\\. After having received this double benediction (through the Brahma _n_ as\nsaying, \'Thus let it be\'),\n\n32\\. He must dismiss the Brahma _n_ as, with the Mantra, \'With all food[1],\'\nafter having honoured them according to custom, accompanied them (as far as\nthe limits of his estate), and taken his leave of them.\n\n[32. 1 Rig-veda VII, 38, 8.]\n\np. 238\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: LXXIV.](sbe07076.htm)\n\n'
