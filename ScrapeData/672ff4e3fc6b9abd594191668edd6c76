And thus Perception and Inference show.\n\np. 769\n\nThat the energies connected with the rule of the entire world are exclusive\nattributes of the highest Person, Scripture and Sm _ri_ ti alike declare.\nCompare scriptural texts such as 'From fear of him the wind blows,' &c.\n(Taitt. Up. II, 8, 1); 'By the command of that Imperishable one sun and moon\nstand, held apart' (B _ri_. Up. III, 9); 'He is the lord of all, the king of\nall beings, the protector of all beings' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 22). And Sm _ri_\nti texts such as 'With me as Supervisor, Prak _ri_ ti brings forth the\nUniverse of the movable and the immovable, and for this reason the world ever\nmoves round'; 'Pervading this entire Universe by a portion of mine I do abide'\n(Bha. Gi. IX, 10; X, 42). Scripture and Sm _ri_ ti likewise declare that of\nthe bliss which is enjoyed by the released soul the highest Person alone is\nthe cause--'For he alone causes blessedness' (Taitt. Up. II, 7); 'He who\nserves me with unswerving devotion, surpasses these qualities and is fitted\nfor becoming one with Brahman. For I am the abode of Brahman, of infinite\nimmortality, of everlasting virtue, and of absolute bliss' (Bha. Gi. XIV,\n26-27). The exalted qualities of the soul--freedom from evil and sin and so on\n--which manifest themselves in the state of Release no doubt belong to the\nsoul's essential nature; but that the soul is of such a nature fundamentally\ndepends on the Supreme Person, and on him also depends the permanency of those\nqualities; they are permanent in so far as the Lord himself on whom they\ndepend is permanent. It is in the same way that all the things which\nconstitute the means of enjoyment and sport on the part of the Lord are\npermanent in so far as the Lord himself is permanent. It thus appears that the\nequality to the Lord which the released soul may claim does not extend to the\nworld-ruling energies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 21.
