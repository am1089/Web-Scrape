[1897], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n10:2:4\n\n### FOURTH BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n10:2:4:11\\. Pra _g_ apati, indeed, is the year, and Agni is all objects of\ndesire. This Pra _g_ apati, the year, desired, 'May I build up for myself a\nbody so as to contain 1 Agni, all objects of desire.' He constructed a body\none hundred and one-fold; and in constructing a body one hundred and one-fold,\nhe built up for himself a body so as to contain Agni, all objects of desire,\nand himself became all objects of desire; there was not one object of desire\noutside of him: whence they say, 'The year (includes) all objects of desire;'\nfor, indeed, outside the year there is no object of desire whatever.\n\n10:2:4:22\\. And in like manner does the Sacrificer now, by constructing a body\n(of the altar) one hundred and one-fold, build for himself a body so as to\ncontain Agni, all objects of desire: he becomes all objects of desire, and not\none object of (his) desire is outside of him.\n\n10:2:4:33\\. Now this year is the same as yonder sun; and he is this one\nhundred and one-fold (Agni);--his rays are a hundredfold, and he himself who\nshines\n\np. 314\n\nyonder, being the one hundred and first, is firmly established in this\nuniverse; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now establish himself in this\nuniverse by constructing for himself a body a hundred and one-fold.\n\n10:2:4:44\\. And, indeed, the one hundred and one-fold passes into (becomes\nequal to) the sevenfold one; for yonder sun, whilst composed a hundred and\none-fold, is established in the seven worlds of the gods, for, indeed, there\nare seven worlds of the gods,--the four quarters and these three worlds: these\nare the seven worlds of the gods, and in them that (sun) is established. And\nin like manner does the Sacrificer now establish himself in the seven worlds\nof the gods by constructing for himself a body a hundred and one-fold.\n\n10:2:4:55\\. And, again, as to how the one hundred and one-fold (altar) passes\ninto the sevenfold one:--yonder sun, composed of a hundred and one parts, is\nestablished in the seven seasons, in the seven stomas (hymn-forms), in the\nseven p _ri_ sh _th_ a (-samans), in the seven metres, in the seven vital\nairs, and in the seven regions; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now\nestablish himself in this universe (or, on everything here) by constructing\nfor himself a body one hundred and one-fold.\n\n10:2:4:66\\. And, again, as to how the one hundred and one-fold passes into the\nsevenfold one:--yonder sun, composed of a hundred and one parts, is\nestablished in the seven-syllabled Brahman, for the Brahman (holy writ or\nprayer) indeed consists of seven syllables,--' _ri_ k' is one syllable, 'ya\n_g_ u _h_ ' two, and 'sama' two; and what other Brahman there is that is just\nthe 'brahman' of two syllables--this\n\np. 315\n\nseven-syllabled Brahman is the universe 1: therein that (sun) is established;\nand in like manner does the Sacrificer now establish himself in the seven-\nsyllabled Brahman by constructing for himself a body one hundred and one-fold.\n\n10:2:4:77\\. Therefore, also, they lay down around (the altar) sets of seven\n(bricks) each time, and hence the one hundred and one-fold passes into the\nsevenfold one; and, indeed, the sevenfold one passes into the one hundred and\none-fold.\n\n10:2:4:88\\. Sevenfold, indeed, Pra _g_ apati was created in the beginning. He\nsaw this body composed of a hundred and one parts--fifty bricks in the Pra _n_\nabh _ri_ ts 2, and fifty sacrificial formulas, that makes a hundred, and the\n'settling' and sudadohas-formula are the two one hundred and first--these two\nare one and the same, for when he has 'settled' (a brick), he pronounces the\nsudadohas-formula over it: by means of this one hundred and one-fold body he\ngained that conquest and obtained that success; and in like manner does the\nSacrificer, by means of this one hundred and one-fold body, gain that conquest\nand obtain that success. And thus, indeed, the sevenfold (altar) passes into\nthe one hundred and one-fold: that which is a hundred and one-fold is\nsevenfold, and that which is sevenfold is a hundred and one-fold. So much as\nto the forms (of altars).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[313:1](sbe4353.htm#fr_612) Literally, May I build for myself a body (self)\nwith a view to (abhi) Agni; or, perhaps, 'He builds (a body) so as to become\n(Agni);' in which case 'abhi' of 'abhisa _m_ _k_ inute' would have the same\nforce as in 'abhisampadyate.' See, however, [X, 2, 5,\n9](sbe4354.htm#10:2:5:9)-[12](sbe4354.htm#10:2:5:12), where Saya _n_ a\nexplains it by 'yo ya _h_ kama _h_ ta _m_ sarvam atmanam abhilakshya\nsampaditavan bhavati'--'He brings about (accomplishes) all that desire for his\nbody.'\n\n[315:1](sbe4353.htm#fr_613) Or, perhaps, 'all this (taken together) is the\nsevenfold Brahman.'\n\n[315:2](sbe4353.htm#fr_614) In the first layer ten Pra _n_ abh _ri_ t bricks\nwere placed along the diagonals in each of the four corners of the body of the\naltar (or in the intermediate quarters), and as many round the centre.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: X, 2, 5.
