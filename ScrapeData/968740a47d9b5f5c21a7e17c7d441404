The prayers, music and other exercises of a devotional\n\np. 320\n\nnature then continued. On hearing the music, Sri Ramakrishna went into Samadhi\nand remained motionless for some time. Then regaining His sense-consciousness,\nHe opened His mouth and in rapt tones began to speak thus:\n\nPsychic powers.The realization of God is not the same as psychic power. There\nare many Yoga powers, but do you remember what Krishna said to Arjuna about\nthem? When you see one who exercises any of these powers, you may know that\nsuch a one has not realized God, because the exercise of these powers requires\negotism (Ahamkara), which is an obstacle in the path of supreme realization.\n\nDanger of psychic powers.There is, indeed, great danger in possessing psychic\npowers. Totapuri thus taught me this truth: A Siddha (a man who had absolute\ncontrol over psychic phenomena) was sitting on the seashore. Suddenly there\narose a violent storm, which caused him great distress. Desiring to stop it,\nhe exclaimed: "Let this storm cease!" His command was instantly fulfilled. A\nvessel was passing at a distance with all sails set. As the wind suddenly died\naway, the vessel capsized and all on board were drowned. The Siddha was the\ncause of the disaster and therefore\n\np. 321\n\nhe had to take the sin of killing so many innocent people. As the result of\nthis terrible sin, he lost his power and after death he had to suffer in\npurgatory.\n\nThe Siddha and the elephant.There was another Siddha, who was very proud of\nhis psychic powers. He was a good man and an ascetic. One day the Lord came to\nhim in the form of a saint and said: "Revered sir, I have heard that thou\npossessest wonderful powers." The good man received him kindly and gave him a\nseat. At this moment an elephant passed by. The saint asked him: "Sir, if thou\ndesirest, canst thou kill this elephant?" The Siddha replied: "Yes, it is\npossible"; and taking a handful of dust, he repeated some mantram over it and\nthrew it on the elephant. Immediately the animal roared, fell on the ground in\nagony and died. Seeing this, the saint exclaimed: "What wonderful power thou\npossessest! Thou hast killed such a huge creature in a moment!" The saint then\nentreated him, saying: "Thou must also possess the power to bring him back to\nlife." The Siddha replied: "Yes, that is also possible." Again he took a\nhandful of dust, chanted a mantram, threw it on the elephant, and lo! the\nelephant revived and\n\np. 322\n\ncame back to life. The saint was amazed at the sight and again exclaimed: "How\nwonderful indeed are thy powers! But let me ask thee one question. Thou hast\nkilled the elephant and brought him back to life; what hast thou gained? Hast\nthou realized God?" Thus saying, the saint disappeared.\n\nDesire for powers prevents realization.Most subtle is the path of\nspirituality. God cannot be realized so long as there is the least desire for\npowers in the heart. You cannot thread a needle so long as there are fibres at\nthe point of the thread. Krishna said to Arjuna: "Brother, if thou wishest to\nrealize Me (God), thou must not desire any psychic powers. The possession of\npsychic power brings pride and egotism, then one easily forgets God. So long\nas there is egotism, Divine realization does not come."\n\nFour stages of realization.There are four different stages in the path of\nrealization. First, that of a beginner, a _Pravartaka_ , or one who has just\nbegun to worship God. Those who belong to this class begin to wear the sign of\ntheir creed, such as the rosary or the mark on the forehead, and they are very\nparticular about the external forms of their sect. The second stage is that\n\np. 323\n\nof the neophyte or _S adhaka_. Those of this class are farther advanced. They\ndo not parade their beliefs and do not attach so much importance to external\nsigns. Their worship is internal. They repeat the Lord\'s Name-silently, pray\nwithout ostentation and feel some longing for God. The third stage is that of\n_Siddha_. What is a Siddha? One who is firmly convinced in his heart and soul\nthat God exists, that He does everything, that He is the Omnipotent Being, and\nwho has obtained a first glimpse of Him. The fourth stage is that of the\n_Siddha of Siddhas_. One who has reached this stage has not only seen God but\nhas made acquaintance with Him and has established a definite relation with\nHim,--either that of a son to his father or that of a mother to her child, or\nthat of friend to friend or of brother to brother, or the relation of husband\nand wife.\n\nFaith and realization.To believe that fire is in the wood is faith. This is\none thing, but it is another thing to bring that fire out of the wood, to cook\nsomething with it, to eat this and to attain peace and happiness afterwards.\nSo to believe that God is in the world and to catch a distant glimpse of Him\nis one thing; but to come into direct communion with Him,\n\np. 324\n\nto enjoy His company and taste Divine Bliss is another. No one can set a limit\nto the various aspects of God which a Bhakta can realize. They rise ever\nhigher and higher.\n\nA devotee: Bhagavan, why can some attain to realization more quickly than\nothers?\n\nRamakrishna: It depends upon the Samskaras or impressions of previous lives.\nNothing happens suddenly or by accident. A certain man drank an ounce of wine\nin the morning and began to act like a drunkard. People, seeing him, wondered\nwhy he should be drunk after taking one small glass of wine. Hearing them,\nhowever, another man replied: "Because he has been drinking all night." Sudden\nconversion.There have been many instances of sudden conversion. People living\nin the midst of wealth and luxury have suddenly renounced the world. Such\nsudden changes are the results of spiritual impressions acquired in the\nprevious life. In the final incarnation of a Jiva, Sattwa qualities prevail:\nhis heart and soul long for realization, the mind becomes unattached to\nworldly pleasures and constantly remains fixed upon the Supreme Being.\n\nThese people here believe in and worship God without form; that is right.\n(Addressing the\n\np. 325\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahmo devotees) Firmness of faith necessary for\nrealization.Be firm only in devotion to one aspect, either in God with form or\nin God without form. Firmness in faith is the first thing necessary for\nrealization. Nothing can be achieved without firmness. If you have firm faith\nin God with form you will attain to Him; similarly if you firmly believe in an\nimpersonal and formless Deity, you will reach Him. Candy will taste sweet\nwhether you bite it straight or crooked. But you will have to be firm and you\nwill have to call upon Him with extreme longing. When a worldly man speaks of\nGod, do you know what it seems like to me? It is just like children\nquarrelling in their play and taking the name of God in vain; or like a fop\nwalking in the garden, stick in hand, who picks a flower and idly exclaims:\n"What a beautiful flower God has made!" And even this mindfulness of God\nexists only for a moment, like drops of water on a red-hot iron. Firmness in\ndevotion to one aspect is absolutely necessary. Dive deep. Without diving into\nthe ocean no one can get the treasure. If you float on the surface, you cannot\nreach it. Learn to love God. Be absorbed in His love. I have heard your\nprayers and devotional exercises; but why do\n\np. 326\n\nyou speak so much of the phenomena which God has made? "O Lord, Thou hast made\nthe sky, the mighty ocean, the moon, the sun, the stars and planets. O Lord,\nThou hast made all these, and so on." Why do you dwell upon these things?\nSeeing the beautiful garden of a rich man, everyone will exclaim: "What a\nbeautiful tree! What a handsome flower! What a large pond and what fine fish\nin it! What an artistic building! With what rich paintings is the drawing-room\ndecorated!" At the sight of all this everyone is struck with wonder, but how\nmany seek to know the master of the garden? A few only. Those who seek God\nwith intense longing see Him, make acquaintance with Him, speak with Him, just\nin the same manner as I am speaking to you. I am telling you the truth when I\nsay that God can be seen. Who will listen to me and who will believe me?\n\nGod and the Scriptures.Can God be found in the Scriptures? After reading the\nScriptures, the highest knowledge one can get is about the existence of a God;\nbut God does not appear to him who does not dive below the surface. Until then\ndoubts are not removed and Divine knowledge does not come. You may read\n\np. 327\n\nthousands of volumes, you may repeat verses and hymns by hundreds, but if you\ncannot dive into the ocean of Divinity with extreme longing of the soul, you\ncannot reach God. A scholar may delude the people by his knowledge of the\nScriptures and by his book-learning, but through these he will not attain to\nGod. Scriptures, books, sciences, what good will they do? Grace of God.Nothing\ncan be acquired without the Grace of the Lord. Yearn after His Grace, devote\nyour energy to obtaining it and by His Grace you will see Him and He will be\nglad to speak to you.\n\nSub-Judge: Revered Sir, is He more gracious to some than to others? In that\ncase He would be partial and unjust.\n\nSri Ramakrishna: How is that? Is a horse the same thing as an earthen pot?\nVidyasagara Difference in asked me the same question. He powers. said to me:\n"Has God given greater powers to some than to others?" I replied: "God\npervades all living creatures equally. He dwells in me in the same way that He\ndwells in the smallest ant, but there is a difference in powers. If all human\nbeings were equal in powers, then why have we come to see you, after hearing\nof you? Is it because you have\n\np. 328\n\ntwo horns on your head? No, it is because you are kind, charitable, learned\nand have many other qualities greater than in others. It is for this reason\nthat your fame is so great. Do you not know men who alone can defeat a hundred\nmen, and again a man who will run away from a single person?" If there be no\ndifference in powers, why should people respect Keshab Chunder Sen so much? It\nis said in the Gita, he whom many people respect and honor either for his\nknowledge or for his musical gifts or for his oratorical powers or for any\nother reason, in him, be assured, there is a special manifestation of Divine\npower.\n\nA Brahmo devotee (to Sub-Judge): Why do you not accept what he says?\n\nSri Ramakrishna (to the Brahmo devotee): What kind of man are you? Do you not\nknow that it is hypocrisy to accept an opinion outwardly without believing in\nit?\n\nSub-Judge: Revered Sir, shall we have to renounce the world?\n\nWorship God in solitude.Sri Ramakrishna: No. Why should you renounce? You can\nattain to God while living in the world; but at first for a few days you will\nhave to live in solitude and worship Him alone. It is necessary to\n\np. 329\n\nhave a quiet place near your house where you can occasionally be alone for\nhours at a time and yet go home for your meals. Keshab Sen, Mozoomdar, and\nothers have told me that they are like Raja Janaka, who lived in the world and\nyet attained to the highest realization. I replied: "It is not an easy thing\nto be like Raja Janaka. Raja Janaka was at first a great ascetic and practised\nextreme asceticism for many years. You could be like him if you practised a\nlittle. A man who writes English very fluently has not acquired that facility\nall at once; he has had to practise for a long time." I also said to Keshab\nSen: "Without going into solitude, how can one cure so acute a disease as\nworldliness? It is like the worst form of typhoid fever. If you keep bottles\nof chutney and jars of water where a patient is suffering from this fever, he\nwill surely be tempted to eat the one and drink the other and then it will be\nimpossible for the best physicians to cure him. Objects of lust are like the\nbottles of chutney, and desire to enjoy is like the thirst after water.\nWorldly thirst has no end. And so long as the object of thirst is kept within\nreach of the patient, how can he be cured? Therefore I say, withdraw from the\nplace where those objects\n\np. 330\n\nare and remain in solitude for a time. Then when the disease is cured, you may\nlive in the world without being tempted by it. It is then that you will live\nlike Raja Janaka." But in the first stage you must be very watchful. In\nsolitude steadily practise devotional exercises. When a fig-tree is young, it\nmust be protected by a hedge, otherwise it may be eaten up by sheep and\ncattle; but when the trunk has grown thick, the hedge is no longer necessary.\nYou may tie an elephant to it without hurting it. If after practising in\nsolitude you have acquired true Bhakti (devotion to God) and have gained\nspiritual strength, then you can go home and live in the world; nothing can\ncorrupt you.\n\nSub-Judge (with great delight): Revered Sir, these are most beautiful\nteachings. We need to practise in solitude, but we always forget it and think\nthat we have at once become Raja Janaka. It has given me great peace and joy\nto hear that it is not absolutely necessary to leave the world and that God\ncan be realized even at home.\n\nSri Ramakrishna: Renunciation, why should you practise it? When you have to\nfight, it is better to do so from within the fort. You will\n\np. 331\n\nRenunciation and worldly men.have to fight against the senses, against hunger,\nthirst and other desires. This fight is easier from within the fort of the\nworld. In this age our life depends upon material food; if you cannot get\nanything to eat for a day, your mind will be turned away from God. A man once\nsaid to his wife: "I am going to leave the world." The wife was very practical\nand replied: "Why wilt thou wander from house to house for food? When thou art\nin need of food, is it not better to go to one house than to ten or more?" Why\nshould you renounce? It is so much more convenient to live at home. You do not\nhave to worry about food; then you have your wife with you. Whenever your body\nneeds anything, you will have it right at hand; when you are ill, you will\nhave many to nurse you. Janaka, Vyasa, Vasishta and others first attained God-\nconsciousness and then lived in the world. They had two swords in their hands,\n--the one of wisdom and the other of work.\n\nSub-Judge: Revered Sir, how can we know that true wisdom?\n\nSri Ramakrishna: When true wisdom comes, God does not appear to be very far.\nHe is no longer there, but here in the heart. He is no\n\np. 332\n\nlonger that but this. He dwells within all. Whoever seeks Him finds Him.\n\nSub-Judge: I am a sinner; how can I say that God dwells in me?\n\nSri Ramakrishna: You always talk of sin and sinners; this is the Christian\ndoctrine. Have faith in the Holy Name of the Lord. By the power of faith all\nsins will be washed away.\n\nSub-Judge: Revered Sir, how can I have such a faith?\n\nRamakrishna: First be devoted to God. You have in one of your songs: "O Lord,\ncanst Thou be known without devotion, simply by good works and sacrifice?"\nThat which brings true devotion and unselfish love for God you must pray for\nwith earnest longing in silence. Shed tears of repentance until you have\nacquired these.\n\nA Brahmo devotee: Revered Sir, when will they get time? They have to work in\ntheir offices.\n\nResign all to God.Ramakrishna (to Sub-Judge): Well, resign yourself to the\nwill of the Lord and draw up a power of attorney in His favor. If anyone\ndepends entirely upon some good man, does he do any evil to him? Internally\nlay upon Him your whole burden and sit\n\np. 333\n\ncalmly, without anxiety. Whatever He has given you to do, do that. A kitten\nhas no self-reliance. It mews and mews and stays where the mother cat places\nit. She may put it on a soft bed or on the hard floor of the kitchen; the\nkitten is always content and depends entirely on the will of the mother.\n\nHouseholder\'s duties.Sub-Judge: We are householders with certain duties; how\nlong shall we have to perform these?\n\nRamakrishna: Of course you have your duties. You will have to bring up your\nchildren, sustain your wife, save enough to maintain your family after your\ndeath. If you did not do this you would be heartless and cruel. Even great\nsages like Sukadeva practised loving-kindness. He is not a man who has neither\nheart nor kindness.\n\nSub-Judge: How long shall we maintain our children?\n\nRamakrishna: Until they have passed the age of minority. When the young bird\nis able to take care of itself, it pecks at the parent bird, if she tries to\ncome near it.\n\nSub-Judge: What is the duty towards the wife?\n\nRamakrishna: As long as you live you should\n\np. 334\n\nGod provides for those who have realized Him.give her spiritual advice and\nsustain and care for her. If she is faithful, save enough to make her\ncomfortable after your death. But when God-consciousness comes, no worldly\nduties can bind you. Then if you do not think of the morrow, God will think\nfor you. If you attain to God-consciousness. He will provide for the support\nof your family. When a Zemindar dies, leaving a son under age, a guardian\nmanages the estate for the child. These are legal affairs; you understand them\nall.\n\nSub-Judge: Yes, Revered Sir.\n\nBijoy: Oh, how great, how wonderful are these words! He who thinks of the Lord\nwith unwavering mind and a heart overflowing with devotion and love for God,\nis undoubtedly taken care of by the Lord. The Lord carries everything for him\nlike the guardian of the Zemindar\'s son. Oh, when shall I reach such a state!\nHow blessed are those who have attained it!\n\nA Brahmo devotee: Revered Sir, can true wisdom be acquired in the world? Can\nGod be realized in the world?\n\nRamakrishna: You are on the fence; you wish to enjoy both God and the world.\nOf\n\np. 335\n\ncourse God can be realized by one who lives in the world.\n\nSigns of true wisdom.Brahmo devotee: What is the sign of one who has attained\ntrue wisdom living in the world?\n\nRamakrishna: When the repetition of the Name of the Lord will bring tears to\nthe eyes, send a thrill through the whole body and make the hair stand on end.\nThe spiritual eye must be opened. It is open when the mind is purified. Then\nthe presence of Divinity will be realized everywhere and every woman will\nappear as Divine Mother. Everything is in the mind. The impure mind brings\nattachment to the world, and the purified mind brings the realization of God.\nThe impure mind of a man becomes attached to a woman. Woman naturally loves\nman and man naturally loves woman, and from this spring attachment and\nworldliness.\n\nDivine Mother in all women.Every woman represents Divine Motherhood. The same\nDivine Mother appears in all women under various forms. It is said the\nScriptures that Narada in prayer thus addressed Rama: "O Rama, Thou art\nPurusha, Thou appearest in the form of all men, and Sita, Thy Prakriti,\nappears in the form of all women. Thou art man and Sita is woman.\n\np. 336\n\n[paragraph continues] Wherever there is masculine form, it is Thy\nmanifestation; and wherever there is feminine form, it is the manifestation of\nSita, the Divine Mother."\n\nAttachment to the body.So long as there is attachment to worldliness, and\nthirst for objects of lust, so long there is attachment to the body. As\nattachment to the world grows less, the mind goes towards the \xc3\x82tman or the\ntrue Sett and the attachment to the physical body becomes less. When the\nattachment to the world has entirely vanished, Self-knowledge comes and the\n\xc3\x82tman is separated from the physical body. When an ordinary cocoanut is cut\ninto halves, it is very difficult to separate the kernel from the shell; but\nwhen it is dried, the kernel becomes separate from the shell by itself. You\ncan feel it by shaking it. A man who has realized God becomes like the dry\ncocoanut, his soul becomes separate from his body and all attachment to the\nbody leaves him. He is not affected by the pleasure and pain of the body; he\ndoes not seek the comforts of the body; he moves from place to place like an\nemancipated soul. "A true devotee of my Divine Mother attains absolute freedom\nin this life and is eternally blissful." When you notice that\n\np. 337\n\ntears flow and the thrill comes at the repetition of the Name of the Lord,\nthen you may know that attachment to sense-objects has become less and the\ndevotee is on the path of realization. For instance, if the match is dry it\nwill ignite the moment it is struck; but if it be wet, you can strike it fifty\ntimes and yet you cannot get a light. Similarly when the mind is soaked in the\nwater of lust and thirst for worldly objects, Divine enlightenment does not\ncome in it, however hard you may try; it is merely a waste of time and labor.\nBut when that water dries up, spiritual illumination comes instantly.\n\nBrahmo devotee: By what method can that water be dried up?\n\nThe Divine Mother will cure worldly attachment.Ramakrishna: Pray to the Divine\nMother with an earnest and sincere heart; when you see Her, the water of\nworldly attachment will dry up. Attachment to lust and wealth will drop away\nfrom you. If you can feel Her as your own mother, it will come to you at that\nvery moment. She is not like a godmother, but she is your own Mother. Go to\nHer and importunately ask for what you want. An importunate child hangs on its\nmother\'s gown and begs a penny to buy a paper kite. The mother\n\np. 338\n\nPride and egotism.may be engaged in talking to other girls and at first she\nmay not wish to give it, saying: "No, your father has forbidden it. I\'ll speak\nto him when he comes home. You will spoil everything if you get a paper kite."\nBut when the child begins to cry and will not give in, then the mother says to\nher companions: "Just wait a minute, let me quiet the child"; she then gets\nthe key to her drawer, opens the money-box, and gives him what he is crying\nfor. Similarly you cry to your Mother and pray to Her, She will surely come to\nyou. (Turning to Sub-Judge) What is the cause of pride and egotism? Do they\narise from knowledge or ignorance? Egotism is the quality of Tamas arising\nfrom ignorance. It is a barrier which prevents the soul from seeing God. When\nit dies, all troubles cease. Of what avail is it to be egotistic? This body\nwith all its comforts and luxuries will not last long. A drunkard, after\nseeing an image at the Durga festival beautifully decorated with jewels and\ncostly ornaments, exclaimed: "Mother, you may decorate yourself with all these\nvaluable things, but after three days they will take you out and throw you in\nthe Ganges." So I say to you all, whether you be a judge or any great\npersonage,\n\np. 339\n\nit is only for a few days. Therefore you must not be proud or egotistic about\nanything.\n\nThree classes of characters.People\'s characters can be divided into three\nclasses,--Tamas, Rajas and Sattwa. Those who belong to the first class are\negotistic; they sleep too much, eat too much, and passion and anger prevail in\nthem. Those who belong to the second class are too much attached to work. They\nlove nice, well-fitting clothes and are very neat; they care for a luxurious,\nrichly furnished house; when they sit and worship God, they love to wear\ncostly garments; when they give anything to charity they parade it. Those who\nbelong to the third class are very quiet, peaceful, unostentatious; they are\nnot particular about their dress, they lead a simple life and earn a modest\nliving, because their needs are small; they do not flatter for selfish ends;\ntheir dwelling is modest; they do not worry about their children\'s dress; they\nare not anxious for fame, nor do they care for the admiration or adulation of\nothers; they worship God, give charity and meditate silently and in secret.\nThis Sattwa quality is the last step of the ladder which leads to the roof of\nDivinity. A person reaching this state does not have to wait long for God-\nconsciousness.\n\np. 340\n\n[paragraph continues] (To Sub-Judge) You said a little while ago that all men\nwere equal, but now you see how characters vary.\n\nii\n\nMusic for a time interrupted the teaching and Bhagavan Sri Ramakrishna, on\nhearing it, again went into Samadhi. The Brahmo devotees sang the Sankirtan,\nand when they had finished, all those present resumed their seats, Bijoy\ntaking his place just before Sri Ramakrishna. It was the hour for another\nBrahmo service at which Bijoy, who was the leader of the Brahmo-Samaj, was to\nread from the Vedas and give an address. Before going to the platform, he\nasked Sri Ramakrishna\'s permission, saying: "Bhagavan, grant me Thy blessing,\nthen I shall begin the service."\n\nEgotism and knowledge.Ramakrishna: When egotism is gone, everything is\naccomplished. "I am lecturing and you are listening;" this sense of egotism\nyou must not have. Egotism proceeds from ignorance and not from knowledge. He\nwho is free from egotism attains knowledge. The rain-water gathers in a low\nplace, it runs off from a high place; similarly the water of wisdom gathers in\nthe humble\n\np. 341\n\nheart. It is very difficult to be a spiritual leader (\xc3\x82charya). One easily\nloses a great deal by it. When many people show honor and respect, ordinary\npreachers become egotistic and are easily spoiled. They cannot go further.\nThey merely gain a little fame. Perhaps people will say: "Oh! Bijoy Babu is a\ngood speaker or he is very wise," that is all. Never think, "I am speaking." I\ntell my Divine Mother: "O Mother, I am merely an instrument in Thy hands. Thou\ndost everything. As Thou guidest me and makest me speak, so shall I speak."\n\nBijoy (very humbly): Please give me Thy permission. Without Thy permission I\ncannot begin the service.\n\nRamakrishna (smiling): Who am I to permit you? Ask the permission of the Lord.\nWhen genuine humility comes, there is no fear.\n\nBijoy repeated his request and Sri Ramakrishna then said: "You can go and\nbegin according to your custom, but keep your mind on God."\n\nBijoy began the service with a prayer to the Divine Mother. After the service\nwas over, he came down from the platform and again sat near Sri Ramakrishna.\nThe Bhagavan said to\n\np. 342\n\nhim: You prayed to Divine Mother; that was very good. They say that the\nmother\'s attraction towards her child is greater than the father\'s. You can\nurge your mother more strongly than you can your father. You have a stronger\nclaim on anything that belongs to your mother than on anything of the father.\n\nAbsolute Brahman and Divine Mother.Bijoy. If Brahman the be the Absolute\nDivine Mother, then is She with form or without form?\n\nRamakrishna: The Absolute Brahman and the Mother of the universe are one and\nthe same. Where there is no activity of any kind, that is the state of\nAbsolute Brahman, but where there is evolution and destruction, there is the\nmanifestation of the Divine Mother. When the water of the ocean is calm,\nwithout a wave or ripple, that is like the state of the Absolute. When the\nwater is in motion and with waves, it is the state of the Creative Energy or\nDivine Mother. Divine Mother is both with form and without form. You have\nfaith in formless Divinity, therefore you can think of my Mother as formless.\nWhen your faith is firm, the Divine Mother will show you how She is. Then you\nwill know that it is not that She is mere\n\np. 343\n\n[paragraph continues] Absolute existence; She will come to you and speak to\nyou. Have faith and you will get everything. If you have faith in the formless\nDivinity, you must make that faith as firm as a rock. But do not be dogmatic;\nyou must never dogmatize about God. You must not say that He is like this and\nnot like anything else. You may say: "I believe in a formless Divinity, but\nwhat else He is, is known to Him. I do not know, I cannot understand." The\nsmall intellect of man cannot grasp the whole. nature of God. A vessel which\ncan hold a pound only, how can it contain four pounds? If God reveals Himself\nto one by His Grace and makes one understand His nature, then one realizes Him\nand not until then. The Absolute and the Divine Mother are one.\n\nBijoy: How can we attain to the vision of the Divine Mother and the\nrealization of the Absolute?\n\nVision of the Divine Mother and the Absolute.Ramakrishna. With earnest longing\nand sincerity pray and cry. When the heart will be purified, then you will see\nthe vision as in pure water you can see the reflection of the sun. Upon the\nmirror of the ego of the devotee is to be seen the reflection of the Absolute\nMother of the\n\np. 344\n\nuniverse with form. But the mirror should be thoroughly polished; if there be\na speck of dirt the reflection will not be perfect. When the sun is to be seen\non the water of the ego and when there is no other means of getting a view of\nthe real Sun, so long the reflected image of the sun should be considered as\nabsolutely real. As long as the ego is real, so long the reflected image of\nthe sun is real, not partially but absolutely. That reflected image of the sun\nis the Divine Mother. If you wish to reach the Absolute Brahman, which is\nimpersonal and without attributes, then start from that reflected image and\nmarch towards the real Sun. The Personal God or Brahman with attributes is the\none who listens to prayers. Pray to Him and He will grant the highest wisdom,\nbecause the same Personal God has the Impersonal aspect also, which is the\nAbsolute Brahman. Divine Energy, which is the Mother of the universe, is\nanother aspect of the same Brahman. All these merge into absolute oneness. The\nMother can give Brahma-Jnana, the knowledge of the Absolute, as also true\ndevotion and absolute love. God is the internal ruler of all. Forsaking\negotism, resign your will to His will; you will get every-thing you desire.\nWhen you mix\n\np. 345\n\nBecome one with all.with other people, you should love them all, become\nabsolutely one with them. Do not hate anyone. Do not recognize caste or creed.\nDo not say that this man believes in a Personal God, that man believes in an\nImpersonal God; this man worships God with form, that man worships God without\nform; this man is a Hindu, that one is a Christian or a Mohammedan. Saying\nthis, do not condemn one another. These distinctions exist because God has\nmade different people understand Him in different ways. The difference lies in\nthe nature of the individuals. Knowing this you will mix with all as closely\nas possible and love them as dearly as you can. Then when you go home, you\nwill enjoy blissful happiness in your soul. Light the candle of wisdom in the\nsecret chamber of your heart. By that light see the face of my Absolute\nMother, and by that light you will also see the true nature of your real Self.\nAll sects of one family.When cowherds drive the cattle to a pasture from\ndifferent quarters, the cows form themselves into one herd as if of the same\nfamily; but when they return at night, they separate, each going to its own\nhome. So the Bhaktas of different sects and creeds, when they\n\np. 346\n\nmeet, are like members of one family, but when they are by themselves, they\nshow their peculiar beliefs and different creeds.\n\nIt was late in the evening, and Ramakrishna, entering the carriage accompanied\nby a few devotees, returned to Dakshineswara.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[319:*](gork14.htm#fr_85) Sinti, a village about four miles north of Calcutta.\n\n[319:\xe2\x80\xa0](gork14.htm#fr_86) Veni Babu was a follower of the Brahmo-Samaj.
