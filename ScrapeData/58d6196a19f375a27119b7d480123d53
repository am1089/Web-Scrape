Su _s_\nravas Kaushya then said to him, 'Gautama, when thou wert just now building up\nAgni, didst thou build him with his face forward, or backward, or downward, or\nupward?\n\np. 391\n\n10:5:5:22\\. 'If perchance thou hast built him looking forward, it would be\njust as if one were to offer food from behind to one sitting with averted face\n1: he thereby will not receive thy offering.\n\n10:5:5:33\\. 'And if thou hast built him looking backward, wherefore, then,\nhast thou made him a tail behind?\n\n10:5:5:44\\. 'And if thou hast built him with his face downward, it would be\njust as if one were to put food on the back of one lying with his face\ndownward: he surely will not receive thy offering.\n\n10:5:5:55\\. 'And if thou hast built him with his face upward--surely, a bird\ndoes not fly towards heaven with its face turned upward 2: he will not carry\nthee to heaven, he will not become conducive to heaven for thee.'\n\n10:5:5:66\\. He said, 'I have built him with his face forward; I have built him\nwith his face backward; I have built him with his face downward; I have built\nhim with his face upward: I have built him in all directions.'\n\n10:5:5:77\\. When he lays down the (gold) man with his head forward (eastward),\nand the two spoons (with their bowls) forward 3, thereby he (Agni) is built\nlooking forward; and when he lays down the\n\np. 392\n\ntortoise 1 with its head backward (westward), and the victims' heads turned\nbackward, thereby he is built looking backward; and when he, lays down the\ntortoise with its face downward, and the victims' heads with their faces\ndownward, and the bricks with their faces downward 2, thereby he is built\nlooking downward; and when he lays down the (gold) man with his face upward,\nand the two spoons (with their open bowls) turned upward, and the mortar\nturned upward, and the fire-pan turned upward, thereby he is built looking\nupward; and when he lays down the bricks whilst moving round (the altar) in\nevery direction, thereby he is built (looking) in all directions.\n\n10:5:5:88\\. Now, the Koshas, whilst driving about, once drove up 3 to an Agni\nwith his head pulled out 4. One of them said, 'The head ( _s_ iras) means\nexcellence ( _s_ ri): he has pulled out his excellence, he will be deprived of\nhis all!' and so indeed it happened to him.\n\n10:5:5:99\\. And another said, 'The head means the vital airs: he has pulled\nout his vital airs, he will quickly go to yonder world!' and so, indeed, it\nhappened to him.\n\np. 393\n\n10:5:5:1010\\. Upwards, indeed, he (Agni) is built up, to wit, (in the shape\nof) the grass-bunch, the clod-bricks, the lotus-leaf, the gold plate and man,\nthe two spoons, the naturally-perforated one, the grass-brick, the Dviya _g_\nus, the two Reta _h_ si _k_ , the [Vi _s_ va _g_ yotis](errata.htm#6), the two\nseasonal bricks, the Asha _dh_ a, and the tortoise; and that fire which is\nplaced on the altar-pile, assuredly, is then most manifestly his (Agni's)\nhead: let him therefore not pull out (the head).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[390:2](sbe4370.htm#fr_801) That is, Ku _s_ ri Gautama, (son and) disciple of\nVa _g_ a _s_ ravas.\n\n[391:1](sbe4370.htm#fr_802) The oblations are offered by the Adhvaryu whilst\nstanding south, or south-west, of the fire, with his face turned towards\nnortheast,--hence Agni, looking eastwards, would not see the food offered him.\n\n[391:2](sbe4370.htm#fr_803) Yady agnir uttana _s_ _k_ itas tarhi yatha uttana\n_m_ vaya _h_ pakshi svayam aka _s_ am utpatitu _m_ na _s_ aknoti kim utanya\n_m_ purusha _m_ dvabhya _m_ pakshabhya _m_ g _ri_ hitvotpatitu _m_ na _s_ akta\niti . . . tva _m_ _k_ itavanta _m_ svarga _m_ loka _m_ prapayitu _m_ na _s_\naknoty uttana _k_ ayanad ity artha _h_ ; abhivakshyatiti vaha _h_ prapa _n_ e\nl _ri_ _t_ i syapratyaye rupam. Say.\n\n[391:3](sbe4370.htm#fr_804) See VII, 4, I, 15. 16.\n\n[392:1](sbe4370.htm#fr_805) See VII, 5, 1, 1.\n\n[392:2](sbe4370.htm#fr_806) Ish _t_ akana _m_ ni _k_ itvenopadhana _m_ nama ri\n_g_ ulekhadakshi _n_ apasavyatryalikhitadilekhanam uparibhage dar _s_ anam.\nSay. The broad side of the bricks not marked with lines is thus looked upon as\ntheir face.\n\n[392:3](sbe4370.htm#fr_807) That is to say, according to Saya _n_ a, whilst\ngoing about officiating at sacrifices, they built the altar in that way at\nsome one's house.\n\n[392:4](sbe4370.htm#fr_808) That is, with a head built on to the altar on the\nfront side of the body; see the diagram of the _s_ yena _k_ iti in Burnell's\nCat. of Vedic MSS. (1870), p. 29.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: X, 6, 1. Sixth Adhyaya. First Brahma _n_ a](sbe4371.htm)\n\n"
