To Him who destroys the mighty delusion set up by the play of Maya\'s\npower, to Him who is incarnate in the Teacher, to Him in the Effulgent Form\nFacing the South, to Him (Siva) be this bow!\n\np. 97\n\n#### Atman identified with the physical body.\n\n1\\. Pratyaksha is the sole authority; the four bhutas (elements) are alone\nreal. There is no moksha other than death; love and wealth comprise the end of\nman.\n\nNo anumana or inference can be relied on till it is confirmed by the senses.\nSuch things as akasa which cannot be perceived by the senses do not exist.\nCarnal gratification is the primary end of man, while wealth, as conducing to\nthis primary end, forms but a secondary end of man.\n\n2\\. There is indeed no Isvara, the Creator; vain is all talk of the other\nworld.\n\nThings grow and change their form by _svabhava_ , of their own accord; we see\nno agent at the back of every substance acting by way of changing its form;\nnone, for instance, pushes an arrow forward once it has been discharged from\nthe bow; once the seed is sown, none constantly helps it to grow into a tree.\nThis is a fact of immediate experience. What need is there to postulate an\nIsvara? Again, variety in the amount of happiness found among\n\np. 98\n\nliving beings can be traced to their own nature (svabhava); there is no need\nto suppose a super-sensuous cause such as Dharma.\n\n2-3\\. If Atman exist apart from the body, let it be seen like a pot in front.\nIt is the body that is perceived as short or tall, as a youth or a child.\n\nAll evidence goes to prove that the body is the Self, while there is none\nwhatever pointing to the existence of a disembodied Self.\n\n3-4\\. The six changes of phenomenal existence,--namely, being, birth, growth,\nchange of form, diminution or decay, and death,--all these pertain to the\nbody.\n\nThey are not spoken of as [pertaining](errata.htm#14) to an Atman distinct\nfrom the body. There is no need to suppose the existence of an Atman distinct\nfrom the body, as the subject of these changes.\n\np. 99\n\n4-5\\. Distinctions of caste and religious order are based on the bodies alone;\nsuch sacraments as jata-karma (the birth-ceremony) are enjoined with reference\nto the body alone. It is with reference to the body that they pronounce the\nbenediction "may thou live a hundred years."\n\n6\\. Thus does the small-witted Charvaka delude the world.\n\n#### Atman identified with Prana.\n\n6-7\\. I breathe, I am alive, I feel hungry, I feel thirsty: on the strength of\nthese and other notions of the sort, some conclude that Prana is Atman.\n\nFinding that the dead body which is to all appearance quite of the same nature\nas the living is yet not self-conscious and does not breathe or perform other\nfunctions of a living being, they hold that Atman must be the Prana, the vital\n\np. 100\n\nprinciple, whose presence in the body makes it alive and whose departure\nreduces it to a corpse.\n\n#### Atman identified with the sense-organs.\n\n7-8\\. I hear, I see, I smell, I cause motion: from an experience of this sort,\nsome rise higher and look upon the indriyas, the sense-organs, as Atman.\n\nAs self-consciousness arises only when the sense-organs are active, Atman must\nbe identical with the sense-organs. There is no evidence of the existence of\nPrana distinct from the senses; for no motion is observed during sleep when\nthe senses are quiescent: and breathing, &c., visible during sleep are a mere\nillusion. As the sense-organs do not perceive objects simultaneously, _i.e._ ,\nas the scope of each sense-organ is restricted to one kind of objects and as\nthere are several sense-organs occupying the body, each of them is an Atman by\nitself.\n\nThe logical order of this and the foregoing theory is reversed in the\nVartikakara\'s exposition, which has only followed the order in which they are\nmentioned in the Hymn. The fact of Prana not ceasing to function during sleep\nwhen all the\n\np. 101\n\nsense-organs are quiescent, would naturally lead to the conclusion that Prana\nis the self more than the sense-organs. *\n\n15\\. On the strength of the notion "I understand," others regard Buddhi\n(Intellect) as the Atman.\n\n#### The body, etc., cannot be Atman.\n\n9-10\\. (The fifth stanza) is intended to refute the theories of those whose\nintellects are thus deluded by Maya.\n\nThe meaning of the stanza may be explained as follows:\n\nHow can objects like the physical body which are insentient like stones, and\nare so different from, Atman, ever feel as the Ego, except by the Lord\nentering into them?\n\np. 102\n\n#### Why the body is not Atman.\n\n10-11\\. Now, the physical body cannot be Atman, because like a pot it is\nvisible, insentient, endued with colour, etc., made up of parts and evolved\nout of matter.\n\n_Visible:_ Depending on something else for its manifestation. _Insentient:_ as\nopposed to self-conscious.\n\n11-12\\. Even in swoon, sushupti and death, the physical body is seen; then,\nbeing distinct from the physical body, etc., Atman is not seen.\n\n12-13\\. The sun is the primary cause of all activities in the world; just so\nis Atman the chief cause of the activities of the physical body, etc.\n\np. 103\n\n13-14\\. "This is my body;" thus feels a woman, a child, and even the blind\nman; none ever feels "I am the body."\n\nIt cannot be contended that the feeling "I am a man " points to a valid\nexperience of the body being the Ego,; for man sometimes dreams of himself\nbeing a tiger. Here the consciousness of Ego, the feeling of "I, "remains the\nsame, unaffected by the different bodies with which the Ego has been\nassociated in the two states of jagrat and svapna.\n\nNow, as to the contention that _anumana_ or inference cannot constitute an\n[authority](errata.htm#15) in itself. Our every day experience furnishes so\nmany instances of our conduct being consciously based on no better authority\nthan _anumana_. What basis, for instance, other than _anumana_ or inference\nfrom past experience, is there for our belief that the food we are going to\neat next moment will appease our hunger? But for this faith in _anumana_ as\nthe right source of knowledge, how can any one get on in life?\n\nAs to the remaining negative assertions of a sweeping character in the\nCharvaka\'s system, it is unnecessary to enter into a detailed discussion.\n\np. 104\n\n#### Why the sense-organs cannot be Atman.\n\n14\\. Not even the sense-organs are Atman, since they are mere instruments like\na lamp.\n\n15\\. Like a musical instrument such as vina, the ear is a means of perceiving\nsound. The eye, like the three lights (sun, moon and fire), is a means of\nperceiving form and colour.\n\n16\\. The nose is a means of perceiving smell, like a flower-vase, etc., and\nthe tongue is a means of perceiving taste, like curd, honey, or clarified\nbutter.\n\n17\\. "The sense-organs I have not; I am dumb, I am deaf." Thus say the\n\np. 105\n\npeople who are wanting in the sense-organs. Are they selfless?\n\n#### Why Prana is not Atman.\n\n18-19\\. Not even Prana is Atman; for there is no consciousness in times of\nsushupti. When man goes to sushupti to gain a respite from the worry caused by\njagrat and svapna life, Prana acts for the mere preservation of the body,\nwherewith to reap the fruits of karma yet unspent.\n\n20-21\\. If Prana\'s unconsciousness then (in sushupti) be due to the inactivity\nof the sense-organs, how, then, while Prana acts, can the senses be inactive?\nWhen\n\np. 106\n\nthe king is still engaged in battle, the army cannot, indeed, cease to fight.\nPrana, therefore, cannot be the Lord of the sense-organs.\n\nIf Prana be the Atman seeking rest in sushupti, then it should be inactive. On\nthe other hand, during sleep Prana is as active as before; it breathes and\ndischarges other functions. If Prana be really the self-conscious Atman whose\ninstruments of action and knowledge are the sense-organs, then it would be\nimpossible for the latter to be inactive so long as the former remains active;\nand sushupti would not then be a period of inactivity.\n\n22\\. Atman, the director of manas, ceasing to work, then all sense-organs\ncease to work. Their lord is therefore Atman.\n\nThus, Atman, the ruler of manas and other sense-organs, is distinct from\nPrana.\n\n#### Why Buddhi is not Atman.\n\nNow the Vartikakara proceeds to refute the Buddhistic theory that Atman is\nnone other than the momentary state of consciousness (Kshanika-Vijnana).\n\np. 107\n\n23\\. Be it known that Buddhi is but a momentary thing which comes and goes.\nIllumined only by Atman\'s reflection, it illumines the universe.\n\nBuddhi cannot be Atman as depending on another for its light. This is\nexplained as follows:\n\n24\\. In Atman is Buddhi born, in Atman alone does it dissolve; non-existent\nbefore and after, by itself it does not exist.\n\nThe origin and the end of a thing cannot be perceived by itself; and these\ncannot be facts of experience unless perceived by some conscious entity. It\nbeing thus necessary that there should be a self-conscious entity perceiving\nthe changes which the Buddhi undergoes from moment to moment, no further\nevidence is necessary to show that Buddhi is not Atman.\n\nTo avoid this difficulty some contend that Atman is not a single detached\nmomentary state of consciousness; that, on the other hand, Atman is a stream\nof states of consciousness of an infinite\n\np. 108\n\nnumber running in a current, each preceding state of consciousness giving rise\nto the next succeeding one and vanishing away as the latter arises. This\nstream of consciousness has neither a beginning nor an end, though the\nindividual states of consciousness of which it is a stream are momentary in\nthemselves. Even this theory is open to objection:\n\n25\\. If each preceding cognition should give rise to the next succeeding\ncognition, there would be a simultaneous presence of innumerable cognitions at\nevery moment.\n\n26\\. No cognition can give rise, subsequently to its disappearance, to another\ncognition; because it does not then exist.\n\nThe Vijnana-Vadin may be asked: Does the preceding cognition exist or not\nexist in the succeeding one to which it .gives rise? In the first case, all\ncognitions being momentary, in every cognition will be present all the\npreceding cognitions which are infinite in number: a conclusion opposed to\nexperience. If this simultaneousness should be avoided, the Vijnana-Vadin will\nhave to give up the hypothesis that each state of consciousness\n\np. 109\n\nexists for only one single moment. In the second case, _i.e._ , if the\npreceding cognition does not exist in the succeeding one, it is tantamount to\nsaying that each cognition arises out of nothing. If so, everything may come\ninto existence at one and the same moment.\n\n#### Why the aggregate of the body, etc., is not Atman.\n\n26-27\\. Even supposing the aggregate of these be Atman: then when one part is\nsevered, there could be no sentiency, because of the absence of an integral\nwhole.\n\nHere a question arises: Does the aggregate as a whole possess sentiency, or is\neach constituent of the whole sentient in itself? In the first case, when even\none constituent--the eye or the ear--is severed from the aggregate, what\nremains should lose all sentiency. But, as a matter of fact, we see the deaf\nand the blind leading a sentient life all the same.\n\nNeither can the other alternative be maintained; for,\n\np. 110\n\n27-28\\. If it be held that there are many sentiencies in the aggregate, then\nthis composition of the many sentiencies will at once break up, or it will\ncome to a stand-still.\n\nEach member in the aggregate may seek to go in an opposite direction to\nothers. One pulling thus one side and another on another side, the system may\naltogether be broken up; or even if such an extreme contingency be averted,\nlife-functions would, at any rate, come to a standstill.\n\n#### Atman is all pervading.\n\nThough Atman has thus been proved to be distinct from the body, from the\nsense-organs, from the vital principle, from the intellect and from the\naggregate of these, still there arises a doubt as to His size. The Jainas, who\nfollow the teachings of the Arhats, hold that Atman is of the same size as the\nbody in which He dwells for the time; some of the so-called Vedantins regard\nHim as atomic, as infinitesimally small in .size, while the Sankhyas maintain\nthat He is infinite, all-pervading. The Vartikakara now proceeds to discuss\nthe question:\n\np. 111\n\n28-29\\. Though dwelling within the body, Atman, to be sure, must be all-\npervading. If He be of the size of an atom, He cannot pervade the whole body.\n\nFor, then, there could not happen that simultaneous sensation of heat and cold\nand of the like pairs of opposites, which we so often feel in the different\nparts of the body. Further, it militates against the fact of more than one\nmember of the body being simultaneously put in action or withdrawn from\naction.\n\n29-30\\. If Atman be of the size of the body, he who was the youth cannot be\nthe same as he that is now old. If Atman be subject to change like the body,\nlike it He shall also perish.\n\nAtman cannot have a definite limited size of its own; for, one and the same\nAtman, having to reap the fruits of karmas of a great variety necessitating\nbirth in various kinds of bodies, one body may be found too small for Him and\nanother too big. Suppose, on the other hand, Atman is all-pervading; then,\n\np. 112\n\n30-31\\. As karma is ripe, Atman, all-pervading as He is, enters into the body\nof a worm, or of an elephant, and so on, like akasa (entering into) a pot or\nthe like.\n\nThough manifested in bodies of a limited size Atman is all-pervading. For\ninstance:\n\n31-32\\. He shines in manas which is infinitesimally small; in svapna, the\nuniverse, animate and inanimate, abides in Atman alone.\n\nThese two facts point to the all-pervading nature of Atman.\n\n#### The illusion.\n\n32-33\\. The illusion that the physical body or the like is the Self arises\nfrom (avidya which is the cause of) samsara. "The Lord has entered within" (\n_Taittir iya-Aranyaka_\n\np. 113\n\n[paragraph continues] 3-11); thus the Sruti has taught with a view to\nliberation.\n\n33-34 Thus, this mighty Maya deludes even these disputants; for, once Sadasiva\nis seen, it immediately vanishes away.\n\n34-35\\. To Him who has neither body, nor sense-organs, nor vital airs, whose\nnature is inaccessible to all organs of perception, who is Consciousness and\nBliss in essence, to Him in the Effulgent Form Facing the South, be this bow!\n\n35-36\\.
