Neither calumny, nor disaster, nor\ndeath itself has any terrors for him. Nothing could have saved me, born as I\nwas into the traditions of this family of ours, but that he has established\nhis own life in the centre of mine, with its peace and truth and spiritual\nvision, thus making it possible for me to realize goodness in its truth.\n\nMy master came to me that day and said: "Is it necessary to detain Sandip here\nany longer?"\n\nHis nature was so sensitive to all omens of evil that he had at once\nunderstood. He was not easily moved, but that day he felt the dark shadow of\ntrouble ahead. Do I not know how well he loves me?\n\nAt tea-time I said to Sandip: "I have just had a letter from Rangpur. They are\ncomplaining that I am selfishly detaining you. When will you be going there?"\n\nBimala was pouring out the tea. Her face fell at once. She threw just one\nenquiring glance at Sandip.\n\n"I have been thinking," said Sandip, "that this wandering up and down means a\ntremendous waste of energy. I feel that if I could work from a centre I could\nachieve more permanent results."\n\nWith this he looked up at Bimala and asked: "Do you not think so too?"\n\nBimala hesitated for a reply and then said: "Both ways seem good-- to do the\nwork from a centre, as well as by travelling about. That in which you find\ngreater satisfaction is the way for you."\n\n"Then let me speak out my mind," said Sandip. "I have never yet found any one\nsource of inspiration suffice me for good. That is why I have been constantly\nmoving about, rousing enthusiasm in the people, from which in turn I draw my\nown store of energy. Today you have given me the message of my country. Such\nfire I have never beheld in any man. I shall be able to spread the fire of\nenthusiasm in my country by borrowing it from you. No, do not be ashamed. You\nare far above all modesty and diffidence. You are the Queen Bee of our hive,\nand we the workers shall rally around you. You shall be our centre, our\ninspiration."\n\nBimala flushed all over with bashful pride and her hand shook as she went on\npouring out the tea.\n\nAnother day my master came to me and said: "Why don\'t you two go up to\nDarjeeling for a change? You are not looking well. Have you been getting\nenough sleep?"\n\nI asked Bimala in the evening whether she would care to have a trip to the\nHills. I knew she had a great longing to see the Himalayas. But she refused...\nThe country\'s Cause, I suppose!\n\nI must not lose my faith: I shall wait. The passage from the narrow to the\nlarger world is stormy. When she is familiar with this freedom, then I shall\nknow where my place is. If I discover that I do not fit in with the\narrangement of the outer world, then I shall not quarrel with my fate, but\nsilently take my leave... Use force? But for what? Can force prevail against\nTruth?\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I](hw08.htm)\n\n'
