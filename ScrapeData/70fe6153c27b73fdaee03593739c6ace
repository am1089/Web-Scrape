Not so, on account of this being observed on account of similarity also;\nas in the case of Death; for (the person in yonder orb) does not occupy the\nworlds (of Death).\n\nFrom a transfer or assimilation of this kind it does not necessarily follow\nthat things of different operation are equal, and that hence those altars of\nmind, and so on, must connect themselves with an actual outward performance.\nFor it is observed that such assimilation rests sometimes on a special point\nof resemblance only; so in the text, 'The person in yonder orb is Death\nindeed,'--where the feature of resemblance is the destroying power of the two;\nfor the person within yonder orb does certainly not occupy the same worlds,\ni.e. the same place as Death. Analogously, in the case under discussion, the\nfact that the altars made of mind are treated as, in a certain respect,\nequivalent to the altar built of bricks, does not authorise us to connect\nthose altars with the sacrificial performance to which the altar of bricks\nbelongs. When the text says that the altar made of mind is as great as the\naltar of bricks, this only means that the same result which is\n\np. 673\n\nattained through the brick-altar in connexion with its own sacrificial\nperformance is also attained through the altar of mind in connexion with the\nmeditational performance into which it enters.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 50.
