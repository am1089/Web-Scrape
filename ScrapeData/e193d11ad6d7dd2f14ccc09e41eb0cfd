Agni desired it and went away with it. The gods\nhaving defeated (the Asuras) pursued (Agni) desirous of recovering it. They\nsought violently to take it from him. He wept; in that he wept ( _arodit_ ),\nthat is why Rudra has his name. The tear that [1] was shed became silver;\ntherefore silver is not a suitable gift, for it is born of tears. He who gives\non the strew, in his house before the year is out they weep; therefore one\nshould not give on the strew. Agni said, 'Let me have a share; then this will\nbe yours.' They replied, 'The re-establishing shall be thine alone.' 'He shall\nprosper', he said, who shall establish the fire with me as its divinity.'\nPusan established it; therefore [2] did Pusan prosper; therefore cattle are\nsaid to be Pusan's. Tvastr established it; therefore did Tvastr prosper;\ntherefore cattle are said to be Tvastr's. Manu established it; therefore did\nManu prosper; therefore offspring are said to be Manu's. Dhatr established it;\ntherefore Dhatr prospered; Dhatr is the year; therefore offspring and cattle\nare born in the course of the year. He who knows thus the prosperity of the\nre-establishing [3] prospers. He who knows his connexions becomes possessed of\nconnexions himself. Agni desiring a share after being established assailed the\noffspring and cattle of the sacrifice. Having removed it, one should re-\nestablish it; thus he unites him with his own portion; verily he is appeased.\nHe should establish under Punarvasu; Punarvasu is the Naksatra for the re-\nestablishing; verily by establishing it under its own deity he becomes\nresplendent. He establishes with Darbha grass, for variety. He establishes\nwith Darbha; verily winning it from the waters and the plants he establishes\nit. The sacrificial cake is offered on five potsherds; the seasons are five;\nverily he wins it from the seasons and establishes it.\n\n### i. 5. 2.\n\nHe who removes the fire casts away the sacrifice and cattle. The sacrificial\ncake is offered on five potsherds; the sacrifice is fivefold, cattle are\nfivefold; verily he wins the sacrifice and cattle. Now he who removes the fire\nis the slayer of the hero among the gods; Brahmans desirous of holiness did\nnot aforetime eat his food; the Yajyas and Anuvakyas are in the Pankti metre;\nthe sacrifice is fivefold, man is fivefold; verily making recompense to the\ngods for the hero he re-establishes the fire [1]. They are of a hundred\nsyllables; man lives a hundred years and has a hundred powers; verily he rests\non life and power. In that Agni when established does not prosper, (it is that\nhe is) desiring a greater portion; in that it is all Agni's, that is his\nprosperity. Speech is uttered together in the house of him who removes the\nfire; the sacrificer is liable to perish on account of the uttering together\nof speech. There are discriminations, to sever speech and preserve the\nsacrificer [2]. He makes a discrimination; verily he makes the holy power\n(Brahman). He speaks the Yajus, muttering; it is as if one who has found a\nrich treasure hides it. To Agni Svistakrt he speaks aloud; it is as if one who\nhas found a rich treasure is fain to go openly. Uttering the discrimination he\nmakes the Vasat cry with the foresacrifice; verily he leaves not his abode.\nThe sacrificial cake is the sacrificer, the oblations are cattle; in that he\noffers these libations on either side of the cake [3], he thus surrounds the\nsacrificer on either side with cattle. 'After performing the Yajus and\ncollecting the apparatus', they say: 'the apparatus should not be collected,\nthe Yajus should not be performed,' they say: the apparatus should be\ncollected and the Yajus performed, for the prosperity of the sacrifice. The\nsacrificial fee is a renovated chariot, a newly-sewn garment, a draught ox let\nloose again, for the prosperity of the re-establishing. 'Seven are thy\nkindling-sticks, O Agni, seven thy tongues'; (with these words) he offers the\nAgnihotra. Wherever there is anything of his nature, thence [4] does he win\nhim. Now he who removes the fire is the slayer of the hero among the gods,\nVaruna is the exactor of the recompense; he should make an offering on eleven\npotsherds to Agni and Varuna; him whom he slays and him who exacts the\nrecompense he delights with their own portion; the sacrificer is not ruined.\n\n### i. 5. 3.\n\na (Thou I art) earth in depth, sky in breadth, atmosphere in greatness;  \nIn thy lap, O goddess Aditi, Agni  \nI place, food-eater for the eating of food.  \nb The spotted bull hath come  \nAnd reached again the mother  \nAnd the father, faring to the heaven.  \nc Thirty places be ruleth;  \nSpeech resorteth to the bird  \nBear it with the days.  \nd With her inspiration from his expiration,  \nShe wandereth between the worlds;  \nThe bull discerneth the heaven.  \ne If thee [1] in anger I have scattered,  \nIn rage or through misfortune,  \nThat of thee, O Agni, be in good order,  \nAgain thee we relight.  \nf Whatever of thee scattered in rage  \nWas spread over the earth,  \nThat the Adityas, the All-gods  \nAnd the Vasus gathered together.  \ng Mind, light, rejoice in the oblation.  \nMay be unite this scattered sacrifice;  \nMay Brhaspati extend it;  \nMay the All-gods rejoice herein.  \nh Seven are thy kindling-sticks, O Agni, seven thy tongues;  \nSeven seers [2], seven dear abodes,  \nSeven priesthoods sevenfold sacrifice to thee;  \nSeven birthplaces with ghee do thou fill.  \ni Return with strength, return,  \nO Agni, with food and life;  \nAgain guard us on all sides.  \nk Return with wealth, O Agni,  \nFatten with the stream,  \nAll gaining on every side.  \nl Leka, Salekha, Sulekha, may these Adityas rejoicing partake of our oblation;\nKeta, Saketa, Suketa, may these Adityas rejoicing partake of our oblation;\nVivasvan, Aditi, Devajuti, may these Adityas rejoicing partake of our\noblation.\n\n### i. 5. 4.\n\n'Earth in depth, sky in breadth,' he says; with this benediction he\nestablishes it. The serpents thought that they were growing worn out;\nKasarnira Kadraveya beheld this Mantra; then did they strike off their worn-\nout skins. With the verses of the queen of serpents he establishes the\nGarhapatya, and so renewing it he establishes it as immortal. Pure food did\nnot come to the earth; she [1] beheld this Mantra; then food came to her. In\nthat he establishes the Garhapatya with the verses of the serpent queen (it\nserves) for the winning of food; verily he establishes it firm in the (earth).\n'If thee in anger I have scattered', he says; verily he conceals it from him.\n'Again thee we relight', he says; verily he kindles him all together.\n'Whatever of thee scattered in rage', he says; verily by means of the deities\n[2] he unites him. The sacrifice of him who removes the fire is split; he pays\nreverence with a verse containing the word Brhaspati; Brhaspati is the holy\npower (Brahman) of the gods; verily by holy power (Brahman) he unites the\nsacrifice. 'May he unite this scattered sacrifice', he says, for continuity,\n'May the All-gods rejoice herein', he says; verily continuing the sacrifice he\npoints it out to the gods. 'Seven are thy kindling-sticks, O Agni, seven thy\ntongues' [3], he says, for sevenfold in seven-wise are the dear forms of Agni;\nverily he wins them. 'Return with strength', 'Return with wealth', (with these\nwords) he offers oblations on either side of the sacrificial cake; verily with\nstrength and with wealth he surrounds on either side the sacrificer. The\nAdityas went from this world to yonder world, they were thirsty in yonder\nworld, having returned to this world and having established the fire, they\noffered these oblations; they prospered, they went to the world of heaven. He,\nwho establishes a fire after the second establishment, should offer these\noblations; be prospers with the prosperity where with the Adityas prospered.\n\n_\n\nThe Reverence of the Fire\n\n_\n\n### i. 5. 5.\n\na As we approach the sacrifice,  \nLet us utter a hymn to Agni,  \nWho heareth us, even from afar.  \nb After his ancient splendour,  \nThe bold ones have drawn the white milk  \nFrom the seer who winneth a thousand.  \nc Agni is the head of the sky, the height,  \nLord of the earth here,  \nHe quickeneth the seed of the waters.  \nd Here hath he first been established by the establishers,  \nYoungest Hotr to be invoked at the sacrifices,  \nWhom Apnavana and the Bhrgus caused to shine,  \nBright in the woods, spreading from house to house.  \ne Ye twain shall be summoned, O Indra and Agni [1],  \nYe twain shall rejoice together in the offering  \nYou both, givers of food and riches,  \nYou both I summon for the winning of strength.  \nf This is thy due place of birth,  \nWhence born thou didst shine;  \nMount it, O Agni, knowing it,  \nAnd make our wealth increase.  \ng O Agni, thou purifiest life;  \nDo thou give food and strength to us;  \nFar away drive ill-fortune.  \nh O Agni, good worker, purify for us  \nGlory in good heroes,  \nGiving increase of wealth [2] to me.  \ni O Agni, the purifying, with thy light,  \nO god, with thy pleasant tongue,  \nBring hither the gods and sacrifice.  \nk Do thou, O shining and purifying one,  \nO Agni, bring hither the gods  \nTo our sacrifice and our oblation.  \nl Agni, of purest vows,  \nPure sage, pure poet,  \nShineth in purity when offering is made.  \nm O Agni, thy pure,  \nBright, flaming (rays) arise,  \nThy lights, thy flames.  \nn Thou art giver of life, O Agni; give me life [3].

'Approach', he says; offspring and\ncattle approach the world; verily he approaches cattle and offspring and this\nworld. 'After his ancient splendour', he says; the ancient is the world of\nheaven; verily he mounts upon the world of heaven. 'Agni is the head of the\nsky, the height', he says; verily he makes him the head [1] of his equals, and\nverily from the world of the gods he rests in the world of men. 'Here hath he\nfirst been established by the establishers', he says; verily he makes him the\nprincipal. 'Ye twain shall be summoned, O Indra and Agni', he says; verily he\nwins might and force. 'This is thy due place of birth', he says; wealth is\ncattle; verily he wins cattle. With six (verses) he pays reverence; the\nseasons are six [2]; verily he rests on the seasons. With six subsequent\n(verses) he pays reverence; they make up twelve; the year has twelve months;\nverily he rests on the year. Just as a man, a horse, a cow, are worn out, so\nthe fire when established wears out; at the end of the year he pays reverence\nwith (verses) containing the words Agni and _pu_ ; verily he renews it and\nmakes it unageing, and also purifies it. He pays reverence; that is his union.\nHe pays reverence [3]; that is his bond. He pays reverence; that is his\nappeal. He pays reverence; that is as if an inferior brings (something) to a\nsuperior and pays him honour. 'Thou art giver of life, O Agni; give me life',\nhe says, for he is a giver of life. 'Thou art giver of radiance, O Agni; give\nme radiance', he says, for he is a giver of radiance. I Thou art guardian of\nthe body, O Agni; guard my body', he says [4], for he is a guardian of the\nbody. 'O Agni, whatever is deficient in my body, do thou make that good for\nme', he says; 'whatever is deficient in my offspring and cattle, do thou make\nthat good for me', be says in effect. 'O thou of various splendour, in safety\nmay I reach the end of thee', he says; that of various splendour is the night.\nThe Brahmans aforetime feared its not dawning; verily he wins the dawn.\n'Kindling thee for a hundred winters' [5], he says; man lives a hundred years\nand has a hundred powers; verily he rests on life and power. This is a pipe\nwith projections; by it the gods made piercings of hundreds of the Asuras; in\nthat he takes up the kindling-stick with this verse, the sacrificer hurls the\nhundred-slaying (verse) as a bolt against his enemy to lay (him) low without\nfail. 'Thou, O Agni, hast attained the radiance of the sun', he says; 'that\nthou art, thus may I be', he says in effect. 'Thou, O Agni, hast the radiance\nof the sun', he says; verily he invokes this blessing.\n\n### i. 5. 8.\n\n'I gaze on offspring', he says; verily he wins all the domesticated animals.\n'Ye are water; may I share your water', he says, for they are water. 'Ye are\ngreatness; may I share your greatness', he says, for they are greatness. 'Ye\nare might; may I share your might', he says, for they are might. 'Ye are\nstrength; may I share your strength', he says [1], for they are strength. 'Ye\nwealthy ones, stay', he says; the wealthy ones are cattle; verily he makes\ncattle stay with himself. 'Be ye here; go not hence', he says; verily he makes\nthem constant, departing not. Now one fire is piled with bricks, one with\ncattle. 'Thou art composed Of every form', (with these words) he strokes the\ncalf; verily he piles it up and makes it piled with cattle. He falls away [2]\nfrom this world who pays reverence to the Ahavaniya; he pays reverence to the\nGarhapatya; verily he rests on this world, and also he makes amends to the\nGarhapatya. He pays reverence with Gayatri verses; the Gayatri is brilliance;\nverily he confers brilliance upon himself; moreover in that he repeats the\ntriad (of verses), (it serves) for continuity. Because of the Garhapatya men\nare born with two feet; to him who knowing thus pays reverence to the\nGarhapatya with (verses) of two feet [3], a hero son is born. 'With strength I\ngaze upon you; gaze on me with strength', he says; verily he invokes this\nblessing. 'That excellent glory of Savitr', he says, for instigation. 'Famous\nthe Soma-presser', he says; verily he wins the Soma draught. 'Make, O lord of\nprayer', he says; verily he wins splendour. 'Never art thou barren', be says;\nno barren night does he pass [4], who knowing thus pays reverence to the fire.\nMay we (set) thee around, O Agni, as a fort', he says; verily he sets around a\nbarrier, that nothing be spilt. 'O Agni, lord of the house', he says; that is\naccording to the text. 'For a hundred winters', he says; 'for a hundred\nwinters may I kindle thee', he says in effect. He utters the name of his son;\nverily he makes him an eater of food. 'This blessing I invoke bringing light\nfor the race', he should say, who has no son born; verily is born to him a son\nbrilliant and resplendent. 'This blessing I invoke bringing light for N. N.',\nhe should say who has a son born; verily he confers upon him brilliance and\nsplendour.\n\n### i. 5. 9.\n\nHe offers the Agnihotra; whatever there is. of the Sacrificer's own, that is\n(still) his. In the generative organ he pours seed, for Agni is the generative\norgan. Then he burns at the end the plants; they then grow more numerous. In\nthat he offers in the evening, he thus pours seed, and makes it productive by\nthe morning (offering). Seed when poured does not prove fruitful unless\nmodified by Tvastr; as many modifications of seed when poured [1] as Tvastr\nmakes, in so many shapes does it become fruitful; the sacrificer is the divine\nTvastr. He pays reverence with many (verses); verily he makes many\nmodifications of the seed when poured. He is fruitful and day by day becomes\ngreater, who knowing thus pays reverence to the fire. The day was the gods',\nthe night the Asuras'. The Asuras entered night with all the precious wealth\nof the gods [2]; the gods thought that they were abandoned; they perceived,\n'The night is Agni's, cattle are Agni's; verily let us praise Agni here; he\nbeing praised by us will restore our cattle.' They praised Agni; be praised by\nthem delivered their cattle from night to day; the gods having gained their\ncattle per formed their desires. He who knowing thus pays reverence to the\nfire becomes possessed of cattle [3]. The sun went from this world to yonder\nworld; he having gone to yonder world bethought him again of this world;\nhaving returned to this world he had fear of death, for this world is, as it\nwere, yoked with death. He reflected, 'Let me praise Agni here; he, praised,\nwill make me go to the world of heaven.' He praised Agni; he, praised, made\nhim go to the world of heaven. He who [4] knowing thus pays reverence to the\nfire, goes to the world of heaven and lives all his days. He mounts these two\nfires who pays reverence to them; he acts according to the desires of one who\nhas attained a higher place. He pays reverence at night, not in the morning,\nfor vows are mingled at night, the bad and the good are on the same level, the\nfire is the light, the evening is the darkness; in that [5] he pays reverence\nby night, he overcomes the darkness by light. 'Should reverence be paid to the\nfire or not?' they say; 'he who day by day makes a present to a man and then\nbegs of him assuredly molests him; and who then will day by day beg of the\ngods?' Then they say, 'The sacrificer sacrifices for the sake of the\nbenediction.' The reverence of the fire is [6] the benediction of him who has\nestablished a fire; therefore reverence should be paid to the fire. Prajapati\ncreated cattle; being created they entered day and night; he recovered them by\nmeans of the metres. In that he pays reverence with the metres, he seeks to\nrecover his own. 'There is not monotony then', they say, 'if one pays\nreverence day by day.' If a man pays reverence to the fire facing it, it burns\nhim; if with averted (face), he is deprived of offspring and cattle; he should\npay reverence with (face) somewhat to the side, then (the fire) does not burn\nhim, he is not deprived of offspring or cattle.\n\n### i. 5. 10.\n\na The name that first, O alI-knower,  \nMy father and my mother bestowed upon me aforetime,  \nDo thou bear it until I return;  \nO Agni, may I bear thy name.  \nb My name and thine, O all-knower,  \nWhich like men changing garments we bear,  \nLet us exchange again,  \nThou for life, and we to live.  \nc Homage to Agni, the unpierced,  \nHomage to the unapproachable, homage to the king!  \nIrresistible is Agni [1], the very vigorous, all-conquering,  \nPowerful, the best, the Gandharva.  \nd O Agni, the gods have thee for father,  \nOffer to thee oblations, and have thee as an umpire  \nWith life, with lordship of cattle (endow) me  \nAnd bestow on me good fortune.  \ne Agni here is of all the best,  \nHe is most adorable,  \nMust ready to win (us) a thousand;  \nTo him be all good strength.  \nf Mind, light, rejoice in the oblation  \nMay he unite the scattered sacrifice;  \nThe offerings at dawn and evening  \nI unite with oblation and ghee.  \ng Rich in milk are the plants [2],  \nThe milk of the shoot is rich in milk,  \nWith the milk of the milk of the waters,  \nO Indra, do thou unite me.  \nh O Agni, lord of vows, I shall perform this vow; may I accomplish it; may it\nbe successful for me.  \ni Agni, the priest, I summon hither;  \nThe gods worthy of sacrifice whom we invoke,  \nLet these gods come in kindly mind;  \nLet the gods enjoy this oblation of me.  \nk Who yoketh thee?

He, who among many\nsacrificers first appropriates the gods, sacrifices to them when the next day\ncomes. The Ahavaniya is the abode of the gods, between the fires of cattle,\nthe Garhapatya of men, the Anvaharya pacana of the fathers. He takes the fire;\nverily he appropriates [1] the gods in their own abode; to them he sacrifices\nwhen the next day comes. By means of a vow is Agni, lord of vows, pure, the\nBrahman is a supporter of vows. When about to undertake a vow he should say,\n'O Agni, lord of vows, I shall perform the vow.' Agni is the lord of vows\namong the gods; verily after announcement to him he undertakes the vow. At the\nfull moon be undertakes his vow with the (strewing of the) straw, with the\n(driving away of the) calves at new moon; for that is their abode. 'The fires,\nboth in the front and at the back, must be bestrewed', they say; men [2]\nindeed desire what is bestrewed, and, how much more the gods whose is a new\ndwelling. With him, when sacrifice is to be made on the next day, do the gods\ndwell, who knowing this bestrews the fire. 'The sacrificer should win both\nbeasts of the wild and of the village', they say; in that he refrains from\nthose of the village, thereby be wins them; in that he eats of the wild,\nthereby he wins them of the wild. If be were to fast without eating, the Pitrs\nwould be his divinity [3]; he eats of the wild, the wild is power, and so he\nbestows power upon himself. If he were to fast without eating, he would be\nhungry; if he were to eat, Rudra would plan evil against his cattle; he\npartakes of water; that is neither eaten nor not eaten; he is not hungry and\nRudra does not plot evil against his cattle. The sacrificer is a bolt, the\nenemy of man is hunger; in that he fasts without eating, he straightway smites\nwith the bolt the enemy, hunger.\n\n### i. 6. 8.\n\nHe who offers sacrifice without faith, they place not faith in his sacrifice.\nHe brings waters forward, the waters are faith; verily with faith he offers\nsacrifice, and both gods and men place faith in his sacrifice. They say, 'They\nfoam over the barrier, they foam over speech, but over mind they do not foam.'\nHe brings them forward with mind; mind is this (earth) [1]; verily with this\n(earth) he brings them forward. The sacrifice of him who knows thus does not\nspill. He collects the weapons of the sacrifice; the weapons of the sacrifice\nare the sacrifice; verily he collects the sacrifice. If he were to collect\nthem one by one, they would have the Pitrs as their divinity; if all together,\n(they would have) men as their divinity. He collects them in pairs, and so he\nmakes the form of the Yajya and the Anuvakya, and thus there is a pair. If a\nman knows the ten weapons of the sacrifice, his sacrifice is in order at the\nbeginning. The wooden sword [2], the potsherds, the offering-spoon, the\nbasket, the black antelope skin, the pin, the mortar and pestle, the lower and\nupper millstones, these are the ten weapons of the sacrifice; the sacrifice of\nhim who knows thus is in order at the beginning. If a man sacrifices after\nannouncing the sacrifice to the gods, they delight in his sacrifice. He should\nas the oblation is being offered recite (the words), 'Agni, the priest, him I\nsummon hither' [3]. Thus he announces the sacrifice to the gods and\nsacrifices, and the gods delight in his sacrifice. This is the taking of the\nsacrifice and so after taking the sacrifice he sacrifices. After speaking he\nremains silent, to support the sacrifice. Now Prajapati performed the\nsacrifice with mind; verily he performs the sacrifice with mind to prevent the\nRaksases following. He who yokes the sacrifice when the yoking (time) arrives\nyokes it indeed among the yokers. 'Who ( _ka_ ) yoketh thee? Let him yoke\nthee', he says. _Ka_ is Prajapati--verily by Prajapati he yokes it; he yokes\nindeed among the yokers.\n\n### i. 6. 9.\n\nPrajapati created the sacrifices, the Agnihotra, the Agnistoma, the full moon\nsacrifice, the Ukthya, the new moon sacrifice and the Atiratra. These he meted\nout; the Agnistoma was the size of the Agnihotra, the Ukthya that of the full\nmoon sacrifice, the Atiratra that of the new moon sacrifice. He who knowing\nthus offers the Agnihotra obtains as much as by offering the Agnistoma; he who\nknowing thus offers the full moon sacrifice obtains as much as by offering the\nUkthya [1]; he who knowing thus offers the new moon sacrifice obtains as much\nas by offering the Atiratra. This sacrifice was in the beginning\nParamesthin's, and by means of it he reached the supreme goal. He furnished\nPrajapati with it, and by means of it Prajapati reached the supreme goal. He\nfurnished Indra with it, and by means of it Indra reached the supreme goal. He\nfurnished Agni and Soma with it, and by means of it Agni and Soma reached the\nsupreme goal. He who [2] knowing thus offers the new and full moon sacrifices\nreaches the supreme goal. He who sacrifices with an abundant offering is\nmultiplied with offspring, with cattle, with pairings. 'The year has twelve\nmonths, there are twelve pairs of new and full moon sacrifices; these are to\nbe produced', they say. He lets the calf go free and puts the pot on the fire:\nhe puts down (the rice), and beats the millstones together; he scatters (the\ngrains) and collects the potsherds; the cake [3] he puts on the fire and the\nmelted butter; he throws the clump of grass, and gathers it in; he surrounds\nthe Vedi and he girds the wife (of the sacrificer); he puts in place the\nanointing waters and the melted butter. These are the twelve pairs in the new\nand full moon sacrifices. He, who thus sacrifices with these, sacrifices with\nan abundant offering and is multiplied with offspring, with cattle, with\npairings.\n\n### i. 6. 10.\n\n'Thou I art secure; may I be secure among my equals', he says; verily he makes\nthem secure.' 'Thou art dread; may I be dread among my equals'; verily he\nmakes them harmonious. 'Thou art overcoming; may I be overcoming among my\nequals,' he says; verily he overthrows him who rises against him. 'I yoke thee\nwith the divine Brahman', he says; this is the yoking of the fire; verily [1]\nwith it he yokes it. With the prosperous part of the sacrifice the gods went\nto the world of heaven, with the unsuccessful part they overcame the Asuras.\n'Whatever, O Agni, in this sacrifice of mine may be spoiled', he says; verily\nwith the prosperous part of the sacrifice the sacrificer goes to the world of\nheaven, with the unsuccessful part he overcomes the foes. With these Vyahrtis\nhe should set down the Agnihotra. The Agnihotra is the beginning of the\nsacrifice, these Vyahrtis are the Brahman; verily at the beginning of the\nsacrifice he makes the Brahman [2]. When the year is completed he should thus\nwith these (Vyahrtis) perform the setting down; verily with the Brahman he\nsurrounds the year on both sides. He who is undertaking the new and full moon\nand the four monthly offerings should set in place the oblations with these\nVyahrtis. The new and full moon and the four monthly sacrifices are the\nbeginning of the sacrifice, these Vyahrtis are the Brahman; verily at the\nbeginning of the sacrifice he makes the Brahman. When the year is completed,\nhe should thus with them (Vyahrtis) set down (the oblations), and so with the\nBrahman he surrounds the year on both sides. To the kingly class falls the\nblessing of the part of the sacrifice which is performed with the Saman [3];\nto the people (falls) the blessing of what (is performed) with the Rc; now the\nBrahman sacrifices with an offering without a blessing; when he is about to\nrecite the kindling-verses he should first insert the Vyahrtis; verily he\nmakes the Brahman the commencement, and thus the Brahman sacrifices with an\noffering which has a blessing. If he desire of a sacrificer, 'May the blessing\nof his sacrifice fall to his foe', he should insert for him those Vyahrtis in\nthe Puronuvakya (verse); the Puronuvakya has the foe for its divinity; verily\nthe blessing of his sacrifice falls to his foe [4]. If he desire of\nsacrificers, 'May the blessing of the sacrifice fall to them equally', he\nshould place for them one of the Vyahrtis at the half-verse of the\nPuronuvakya, one before the Yajya, and one at the half-verse of the Yajya, and\nthus the blessing of the sacrifice falls to them equally. Even as Parjanya\nrains down good rain, so the sacrifice rains for the sacrificer; they surround\nthe water with a mound, the sacrificer surrounds the sacrifice with a\nblessing. 'Thou art mind derived from Prajapati [5], with mind and true\nexistence do thou enter me', he says; mind is derived from Prajapati, the\nsacrifice is derived from Prajapati; verily he confers upon himself mind and\nthe sacrifice. 'Thou art speech, derived from Indra, destroying the foe; do\nthou enter me with speech, with power', he says; speech is derived from Indra;\nverily he confers upon himself speech as connected with Indra.\n\n### i. 6. 11.\n\nHe who knows the seventeenfold Prajapati as connected with the sacrifice rests\nsecure through the sacrifice, and falls not away from the sacrifice. 'Do thou\nproclaim' has four syllables; 'Be it proclaimed' has four syllables; 'Utter'\nhas two syllables; 'We that do utter' has five syllables; the Vasat has two\nsyllables; this is the seventeenfold Prajapati as connected with the\nsacrifice; he who knows thus rests secure through the sacrifice and does not\nfall away from the sacrifice. He who knows the beginning, the support, the end\nof the sacrifice [1] reaches the end with a secure and uninjured sacrifice.\n'Do thou proclaim'; 'Be it proclaimed'; 'Utter'; 'We that do utter'; the Vasat\ncall, these are the beginning, the support, the end of the sacrifice; he who\nknows thus reaches the end with a secure and uninjured sacrifice. He who knows\nthe milking of the generous one milks her indeed. The generous one is the\nsacrifice; (with the words) 'Do thou proclaim', he calls her; with 'Be it\nproclaimed' [2], he lets (the calf) go up to her; with 'Utter', he raises (the\npail); with 'We that do utter', he sits down beside her, and with the Vasat\ncall he milks. This is the milking of the generous one; he who knows thus\nmilks her indeed. The gods performed a sacrificial session; the quarters were\ndried up; they discerned this moist set of five; (with the words) 'Do thou\nproclaim', they produced the east wind; with 'Be it proclaimed', they caused\nthe clouds to mass together; with 'Utter' they begat [3] the lightning; with\n'We that do sacrifice' they made rain to fall, and with the Vasat call they\ncaused the thunder to roll. Then for them the quarters were made to swell; for\nhim who knows thus the quarters are made to swell. One knows Prajapati,\nPrajapati knows one; whom Prajapati knows, he becomes pure. This is the\nPrajapati of the texts, 'Do thou proclaim', 'Be it proclaimed', 'Utter', 'We\nthat do utter', the Vasat call; he who knows thus becomes pure. 'Of the\nseasons spring [4] I delight', he says; the fore-sacrifices are the seasons;\nverily he delights the seasons; they delighted place themselves in order for\nhim; the seasons are in order for him who knows thus. 'By sacrifice to the\ngods, Agni and Soma, may I be possessed of sight', he says; the sacrifice is\npossessed of sight through Agni and Soma; verily by means of them he confers\nsight upon himself. 'By sacrifice to the god Agni, may I be an eater of food',\nhe says; Agni is among the gods the eater of food; verily by means of him [5]\nhe confers the eating of food upon himself. 'Thou art a deceiver; may I be\nundeceived; may I deceive N. N.', he says; by that deceit the gods deceived\nthe Asuras; verily by this he deceives his foe. 'By sacrifice to the gods,\nAgni and Soma, may I be a slayer of foes', he says; by means of Agni and Soma\nIndra slew Vrtra; verily by means of them he lays low his foe. 'By sacrifice\nto the gods, Indra and Agni, may I be powerful and an eater of food', he says;\nverily he becomes powerful and an eater of food. 'By sacrifice to the god\nIndra, may I be powerful', he says; verily he becomes powerful. 'By sacrifice\nto the god Mahendra, may I attain superiority and greatness', he says; verily\nhe attains superiority and greatness. 'By sacrifice to the god Agni Svistakrt,\nmay I attain security through the sacrifice, enjoying long life', he says;\nverily he confers long life upon himself and attains security through the\nsacrifice.\n\n### i. 6. 12\n\na Indra for you we invoke  \nOn all sides from other men;  \nBe he ours only.  \na Indra men call in reverence  \nThat he may cause their prayers to be accomplished;  \nHero, men overpowering, delighting in strength,  \nDo thou confer upon us a stall full of kine.  \nc O \xc3\x87atakratu, the strength of thine  \nThat is in the five folks,  \nThat do I choose of thee.  \nd To thee hath been assigned for mighty power,  \nFor ever, in the slaying of Vrtra,  \nAll lordship, and all strength, O thou that art worthy of sacrifice  \nIn the overcoming of man, by the gods, O Indra [1].  \nc In whom the seven Vasavas rest  \nAs it were firm rooted,  \nThe Rsi of farthest hearing,  \nThe glowing pot is the guest of Indra.  \nf In the raw thou didst produce the cooked,  \nAnd madest the sun to mount in the sky;  \nLike the glowing pot heat ye the Saman  \nWith good prayers, delightful to the lover of song.  \ng Indra the singers aloud,  \nIndra with praises the praisers,  \nIndra the songs have praised.  \nh The singers sing thee [2];  \nThe praisers hymn thy praise;  \nThe Brahmans raise thee,  \n0 \xc3\x87atakratu, like a pole.  \ni Let us offer our praise to him who delivereth from trouble,  \nSwiftest to give, celebrating his loving kindness;  \nO Indra, accept this oblation;  \nMay the desires of the sacrificer be fulfilled.  \nk That to which Dhisana impelled me have I produced;  \nI shall praise Indra before the decisive day;  \nHim that goeth as with a ship  \nBoth parties invoke that there he may rescue us.  \nl First lord of sacrifices [3],  \nFreeing from trouble, the best of those worthy of offering,  \nSon of the waters, the impeller, O ye A\xc3\xa7vins;  \nDo ye confer power and strength on this one.  \nm Smite away our foes, O Indra;  \nCast down the warriors;  \nMake him low  \nWho is hostile to us.  \nn O Indra, thou wast born for rule, for prosperous strength  \nOf the people, O strong one;  \nThou didst smite away the unfriendly folk,  \nAnd madest wide room for the gods.  \no Like a dread beast, evil, roaming the mountains,  \nHe hath come from the furthest place [4];  \nSharpening thy lance, thy sharp edge, O Indra,  \nSmite the foes, drive away the enemy.  \np Drive away the foe, the enemy,  \nSmash the jaws of Vrtra;  \nIn rage do thou avert the anger  \nOf him who is hostile to us.  \nq The guardian Indra, the helper Indra,  \nThe hero ready to hear at every call, Indra,  \nI invoke the strong one, invoked of many, Indra;  \nMay Indra in his bounty bestow on us prosperity.  \nr May we not [5], O strong one, in this distress,  \nBe handed over to evil, O lord of the ways;  \nGuard us with true protection;  \nMay we be dear to you among the princes.  \ns The Anus have wrought a chariot for thy steed;  \nTvastr a glorious bolt, O thou invoked of many;  \nThe Brahmans magnifying Indra with their praises  \nHave strengthened him for the slaying of the serpent.  \nt What time the strong sang praise to the strong,  \nO Indra, the stones and Aditi in unison,  \nWithout steeds or chariots were the fellies  \nWhich, sped by Indra, rolled against the Dasyus.\n\n## PRAPATHAKA VII\n\n_\n\nThe Part of the Sacrificer in the New and Full Moon Sacrifices\n\n_\n\ni. 7. 1. Cattle attend the cooked offerings of him who has established a fire.\nThe cooked offering is the Ida; it is placed in the world of the sacrifice\nbetween the fore- and the after-offerings. Over it as it is brought up he\nshould say, 'O thou of fair rain colour, come hither'; the cattle are the Ida;\nverily he summons cattle. The gods milked the sacrifice, the sacrifice milked\nthe Asuras; the Asuras, being milked by the sacrifice, were defeated; he, who\nknowing the milking of the sacrifice [1] sacrifices, milks another sacrificer.\n'May the blessing of this sacrifice be fulfilled for me', he says; this is the\nmilking of the sacrifice; verily with it he milks it. The cow is milked\nwillingly, and willingly the Ida is milked for the sacrificer; these are the\nteats of Ida, 'Ida is invoked'. Vayu is the calf. When the Hotr summons the\nIda, then the sacrificer looking at the Hotr should in mind reflect on Vayu\n[2]; verily he lets the calf go to the mother. By the whole sacrifice the gods\nwent to the world of heaven; Manu laboured with the cooked offering; the Ida\nwent to Manu; the gods and the Asuras called severally upon her, the gods\ndirectly, the Asuras indirectly; she went to the gods; the cattle choose the\ngods, cattle deserted the Asuras. If he desire of a man, 'May he be without\ncattle', he should invoke the Ida indirectly for him; verily he becomes\nwithout cattle [3]. If he desire of a man, 'May he be rich in cattle', he\nshould invoke the Ida directly for him; verily he becomes rich in cattle. The\ntheologians say, 'He would invoke the Ida indeed who in invoking the Ida\nshould invoke himself in the Ida.' 'To us be she dear, victorious, bountiful',\nhe says; verily in invoking the Ida he invokes himself in the Ida. The Ida is\nas it were a breach in the sacrifice; half they eat [4], half they wipe; in\nthis regard the sacrifice of the Asuras was broken; the gods united it by the\nholy power (Brahman). 'May Brhaspati extend this for us', he says; Brhaspati\nis the holy power (Brahman) of the gods; verily by the holy power (Brahman) he\nunites the sacrifice. 'May he unite this scattered sacrifice', he says, for\ncontinuity. 'May the All-gods rejoice here', he says; verily continuing the\nsacrifice he indicates it to the gods. The [5] sacrificial fee which he gives\nat the sacrifice his cattle accompany; he having sacrificed is like to become\nwithout cattle; 'the sacrificer must so arrange', they say, 'that he may place\namong the gods what is given, but keep his cattle with himself.' 'Swell, O\nruddy one', he says; the ruddy one is the sacrifice; verily he magnifies the\nsacrifice; thus he places among the gods what is given, but keeps his cattle\nwith himself. 'May (my act) as I give be not destroyed', he says; verily he\navoids destruction; 'May (my act) as I work not perish', he says; verily he\nattains prosperity.\n\n### i. 7. 2.\n\nSam\xc3\xa7ravas Sauvarcanasa said to Tumi\xc3\xb1ja Aupoditi: 'When thou hast been a Hotr\nof Sattrins, what Ida hast thou invoked?' 'Her I have invoked', he said, 'who\nsupports the gods by her expiration, men by her cross-breathing, and the Pitrs\nby her inspiration.' 'Does she divide, or does she not divide' (he asked).\n'She divides', he replied. 'Her body then hast thou invoked', he said. Her\nbody is the cow [1]; of the cow were they two talking. She who is given in the\nsacrifice supports the gods with her expiration; she by whom men live\n(supports) men by her cross-breathing; she whom they slay for the Fathers\n(supports) the Fathers by her inspiration; he who knows thus becomes rich in\ncattle. 'Her too I have invoked', he said, 'who is available to people as they\nincrease.' 'Her food then [2] hast thou invoked', he replied. This food is\nplants, plants are available to people as they increase; he who knows thus\nbecomes an eater of food. 'Her too I have invoked', he said, who supports\npeople in distress and succours them as they improve.' Her support then hast\nthou invoked', he replied. Her support is this (earth) [3], this (earth)\nsupports people in distress and succours them as they improve; he who knows\nthus finds support. 'Her too I have invoked', he said, 'in whose step people\ndrink the ghee they live upon.' 'Does she divide, or does she not divide?' (he\nasked). 'She does not divide', he said, 'but she propagates.' 'Indeed hast\nthou invoked the Ida herself ', he replied. The Ida is rain; in the step of\nrain people drink the ghee they live upon; he who knows thus is propagated\nwith offspring; he becomes an eater of food.\n\n### i. 7. 3.\n\nSecretly offering is made to one set of gods, openly to another. The gods who\nreceive offering secretly, he thus offers to them in sacrifice; in that he\nbrings the Anvaharya mess--the Brahmans are the gods openly--them he verily\ndelights. This is his sacrificial fee: verily he mends the rent in the\nsacrifice; whatever in the sacrifice is harsh or is injured, that he makes\ngood ( _anvaharati_ ) [1] with the Anvaharya mess, and that is why it has its\nname. Now the priests are the messengers of the gods; in that he brings the\nAnvaharya mess, he delights the messengers of the gods. Prajapati distributed\nthe sacrifice to the gods; he reflected that he was empty; he per ceived this\nAnvaharya mess unallotted; he conferred it upon himself. The Anvaharya is\nconnected with Prajapati; he, who knowing thus brings the Anvaharya, assuredly\nenjoys Prajapati. An unlimited amount should be poured out, Prajapati is\nunlimited; (verily it serves) to win Prajapati [2]. Whatever the gods did in\nthe sacrifice, the Asuras did; the gods perceived the Anvaharya connected with\nPrajapati; they seized it - then the gods prospered, the Asuras were defeated;\nhe who knowing thus brings the Anvaharya prospers himself, his foe is\ndefeated. By the sacrifice there is offering, by the cooked food satisfying.\nHe who knowing thus brings the Anvaharya, accomplishes at once sacrifice and\nsatisfaction. 'Thou art the portion of Prajapati' [3], he says; verily he\nunites Prajapati with his own portion. 'Full of strength and milk', he says;\nverily he confers upon him strength and milk. 'Protect my expiration and\ninspiration; protect my breathing together and cross-breathing', he says;\nverily he invokes this blessing. 'Thou art imperishable, for imperishableness\nthee; mayst thou not perish for me, yonder, in yonder world', he says. Food\nperishes in yonder world, for given hence in yonder world people live upon it;\nin that he touches thus, he makes it imperishable; his food perishes not in\nyonder world.\n\n### i. 7. 4.\n\n'By I sacrifice to the divine strew, may I be possessed of children', he says;\nby the strew Prajapati created offspring, verily he creates offspring. 'By\nsacrifice to the god Nara\xc3\xa7ansa, may I be possessed of cattle', he says; by\nNara\xc3\xa7ansa Prajapati created cattle; verily he creates cattle. 'By sacrifice to\nthe god, Agni Svistakrt, may I attain security through the sacrifice, having\nlong life', he says; verily he confers life on himself, and finds support\nthrough the sacrifice. With the victory of the new and full moon sacrifices\n[1] the gods conquered, and by means of the new and full moon sacrifices they\ndrove away the Asuras. 'May I be victorious through the victory of Agni', he\nsays; verily through the victory of the deities in the new and full moon\nsacrifices the sacrificer is victorious, and by means of the new and full moon\nofferings drives away his enemies. With two verses containing the word\n'strength', he accompanies the separation (of the ladles) strength is food\nverily he wins food; (he uses) two, for support. He who sacrifices knowing the\ntwo milkings of the sacrifice milks thus the sacrifice on both sides [2], in\nfront and behind; this is one milking of the sacrifice, another is in the Ida.\nWhen the Hotr utters the name of the sacrificer, then he should say, 'Hither\nthese blessings have come, fain for milking'; verily he milks the deities\nwhich he praises together; verily he milks the sacrifice on both sides, in\nfront and behind. 'With the red steed may Agni convey thee to the god', he\nsays; these are the steeds of the gods [3], the straw is the sacrificer; in\nthat he casts forward the straw with them, he makes the sacrificers to go by\nthe steeds of the gods to the world of heaven. 'I unyoke thy head ropes, thy\nreins', he says; that is the unyoking of Agni; verily thereby he unyokes him.\n'By sacrifice to the god Visnu, by the sacrifice may I attain health and\nwealth and security', he says; Visnu is the sacrifice; verily the sacrifice\nfinds support at the end. 'By sacrifice to the god Soma, possessing good seed\n[4], may I impregnate seed', he says; Soma is the impregnator of seed; verily\nhe confers seed upon himself. 'By sacrifice to the god Tvastr, may I prosper\nthe form of cattle'; Tvastr is the form-maker of the pairings of cattle, and\nthereby he confers upon himself the form of cattle. 'The wives of the gods,\nAgni, the lord of the house, are the pair of the sacrifice; by sacrifice to\nthese deities may I be propagated with a pair.' 'Thou art the bundle, thou art\ngain, may I gain', he says; by the bundle ( _vedena_ ) the gods won (\n_avindanta_ ) the desirable wealth of the Asuras, and that is why the bundle\nhas its name. Whatever of his foe's he may covet, the name of that he should\nutter; verily he wing it all from him. 'May the bundle bestow increase of\nwealth, rich in ghee, rich in houses, a thousandfold, strong', he says; he\nobtains a thousand cattle. In his offspring a strong one is born who knows\nthus.\n\n### i. 7. 5.\n\nThrough the emptying of the Dhruva the sacrifice is emptied, through the\nsacrifice the sacrificer, through the sacrificer offspring. Through the\nswelling of the Dhruva, the sacrifice is made to swell, through the sacrifice\nthe sacrificer, through the sacrificer offspring. 'Let the Dhruva swell with\nghee', he says; verily he makes the Dhruva to swell; through its swelling the\nsacrifice is made to swell, through the sacrifice the sacri ficer, throuo - h\nthe sacrificer offspring. 'Prajapati's is the world called Vibhan. In it I\nplace thee along with the sacrificer', he says [1]; the world of Prajapati,\nnamed Vibhan, is this (world); verily he places it in it along with the\nsacrificer. In that he sacrifices he is as it were emptied; in that he eats\nthe sacrificer's portion, he fills himself. The sacrifice is the size of the\nsacrificer's portion, the sacrificer is the sacrifice; in that he eats the\nsacrificer's portion, he places the sacrifice in the sacrifice. There is good\ngrass and good water where the strew and the waters are [2]; the Vedi is the\nabode of the sacrificer; in that he places the full bowl within the Vedi, he\nestablishes good grass and good water in his own abode. 'Thou art real, be\nreal for me', he says; the sacrifice is the waters, ambrosia is the water;\nverily he bestows upon himself the sacrifice and the waters. All creatures\nattend him who is performing the vow. 'In the eastern quarter may the gods,\nthe priests, make (me) bright', he says; this is the concluding bath of the\nnew and full moon sacrifices [3]. He goes to the bath along with the creatures\nwhich attend him as he performs the vow. Headed by Visnu the gods won these\nworlds by the metres so as to be irrecoverable; in that he takes the steps of\nVisnu the sacrificer becoming Visnu wins these worlds by the metres so as to\nbe irrecoverable. 'Thou art the step of Visnu, smiting imprecations', he says;\nthe earth is the Gayatri, the atmosphere is connected with the Tristubh, the\nsky is the Jagati, the quarters are connected with the Anustubh; verily by the\nmetres he wins these worlds in order.\n\n### i. 7. 6.\n\n'We have come to the heaven: to the heaven we have come', he says; verily he\ngoes to the world of heaven. 'May I not be cut off from seeing thee; what heat\nis thine, to that of thee may I not be brought low', he says; that is\naccording to the text. 'Thou art good, the best of rays; thou art life-\nbestowing, bestow life upon me', he says; verily he invokes this blessing. He\nfalls away from this world, who [1] takes the steps of Visnu, for from the\nworld of heaven the steps of Visnu are taken. The theologians say, 'He indeed\nwould take the steps of Visnu who after acquiring these worlds of his foe\nshould descend again to this world.' This is his return descent to this world,\nin that he says,'Here do I exclude my enemy N. N. from these quarters, from\nthis sky'; verily having acquired these worlds of his foe he descends again to\nthis world. 'I have been united [2] with the light', he says; verily he rests\non this world. 'I turn the turning of Indra', he says; Indra is yonder sun;\nverily he turns his turning. He turns to the right; verily he revolves round\nhis own strength; therefore the right side of a man is the stronger; verily\nalso he turns the turning of the sun. 'May I be united with offspring,\noffspring with me', he says; verily [3] he invokes this blessing. 'Kindled, O\nAgni, shine for me; kindling thee, O Agni, may I shine', he says; that is\naccording to the text. 'Be rich the sacrifice; may I be rich', he says; verily\nhe invokes this blessing. Within the Garhapatya much variegated work is\nperformed; with two verses to Agni, the purifier, he pays reverence to the\nGarhapatya; verily he purifies the fire, he purifies himself; (he uses) two\nfor support. 'O Agni, lord of the house', he says [4]; that is according to\nthe text. 'For a hundred winters', he says; 'for a hundred winters may I\nkindle thee', he says in effect. He utters the name of his son; verily he\nmakes him an eater of food. 'This prayer I utter, bringing light for the\nrace', he should say who has no son born to him, verily is born to him a\nbrilliant and resplendent son. 'This prayer I utter, bringing light to N. N.',\nhe should say who has a son born [5]; verily he bestows upon him brilliance\nand splendour. He who having yoked the sacrifice does not let it free becomes\nwithout a support. 'Who yoketh thee? Let him set thee free', he says; Who (\n_ka_ ) is Prajapati; verily by Prajapati he yokes him, by Prajapati he lets\nhim free, for support. The vow if not released is liable to consume (the\nsacrificer); 'O Agni, lord of vows, I have performed my vow', he says; verily\nhe releases his vow [6], for atonement, to prevent burning. The sacrifice goes\naway, and turns not back; to him who sacrifices knowing the restoration of the\nsacrifice it does turn back; 'The sacrifice hath become, it hath come into\nbeing', he says; this is the restoration of the sacrifice, and thereby he\nrestores it. Excellence has not been obtained by him who having established a\nfire has no retinue; cattle indeed are the retinue of a Brahman. Having\nsacrificed, he should step forward to the east and say, 'Rich in cattle, in\nsheep, O Agni, in horses is the sacrificer'; he wins his retinue, he obtains a\nthousand cattle, in his offspring a strong one is born.\n\n_\n\nThe Vajapeya\n\n_\n\n### i. 7. 7.\n\na O god Savitr, instigate the sacrifice, instigate the lord of the sacrifice\nfor good luck; may the divine Gandharva who purifieth thoughts purify our\nthought; may the lord of speech to-day make sweet our utterance.  \nb Thou art the thunderbolt of Indra, slaying obstructions, with thee may this\none smite Vrtra.  \nc On the instigation of strength, the mother, the mighty one,  \nWe shall proclaim with our speech, Aditi, by name,  \nInto whom all this world hath entered;  \nIn her may the god Savitr instigate right for us.  \nd In the waters [1] is ambrosia, in the waters is medicine;  \nThrough the guidance of the waters  \nBe ye steeds, O ye that are strong.  \ne Or Vayu thee, or Manu thee,  \nThe seven and twenty Gandharvas;  \nThey first yoked the steed;  \nThey placed swiftness in it.  \nf Child of the waters, swift one, the towering onrushing wave most fain to win\nthe prize, with it may he win the prize.  \ng Thou art the stepping of Visnu, thou art the step of Visnu, thou art the\nstride of Visnu.  \nh May the two Ankas, the two Nyankas, which are on either side of the chariot,  \nSpeeding on with the rushing wind,  \nThe far-darting, powerful one, the winged one,  \nThe fires which are furtherers, further us.\n\n### i. 7. 8.\n\na On the instigation of the god Savitr, through Brhaspati, winner of the\nprize, may I win the prize.  \nb On the instigation of the god Savitr, through Brhaspati, winner of the\nprize, may I mount the highest vault.  \nc To Indra utter your voices, make Indra win the prize, Indra hath won the\nprize.  \nd O whip, strong, having strength for the prizes,  \nDo thou in the contests strengthen the steeds.  \ne The swift art thou, the runner, the strong.  \nf O steeds, hasten for the prize; conquer on the instigation of the Maruts:\nmeasure ye the leagues; establish the ways [1]; attain the goal.  \ng For each prize aid us, O ye steeds,  \nFor the rewards, O ye wise, immortal, righteous ones;  \nDrink of this mead, rejoice in it;  \nDelighted go by paths on which the gods go.  \nh May the swift coursers, who hear the call,  \nAll hearken to our cry.  \ni Strong limbed, winning a thousand,  \nEager to gain in the gaining of praise,  \nThe steeds, which have won in the contests great prizes,  \nMay they be propitious to us when we call.  \nk Among the gods, strong limbed, good praisers,  \nDestroying the serpent, the wolf, the Raksases,  \nFor ever may they remove from us evil [2].  \n1 This steed speedeth his swift course,  \nBound at the neck, the shoulder, and the mouth;  \nDisplaying his strength Dadhikra  \nSpringeth along the bends of the ways.  \nm After him as he hasteneth in triumphant speed  \nBloweth the wind as after the wing of the bird,  \nOf the impetuous eagle, (after him) Dadhikravan,  \nAs in his might he crosseth the winding ways.  \nn May there come to me the instigation of strength;  \nMay there come sky and earth with all healing;  \nCome to me father [3] and mother;  \nMay Soma come to me for immortality.  \no O ye steeds, prize winning, about to run for the prize, about to win the\nprize, do ye touch Brhaspati's portion.  \np O ye steeds, prize winning, that have run for the prize, that have won the\nprize, do ye be pure in Brhaspati's portion.  \nq True hath been the compact  \nThat ye did make with Indra.  \nr Ye have made Indra win the prize, O trees; now be ye loosed.\n\n### i. 7. 9.\n\na Thou art the caul of the kingly class, thou art the womb of the kingly\nclass.  \nb O wife, come hither to the heaven; let us two mount!
