Not very long after his first wife died, he married again, and his\nsecond wife did not care for her step-children, and was often unkind to them;\nand the Rajah, their father, never troubled himself to look after them, but\nallowed his wife to treat them as she liked. This made the poor girls very\nmiserable, and one day one of them said to the other, 'Don't let us remain any\nlonger here; come away into the jungle, for nobody here cares whether we go or\nstay.' So they both walked off into the jungle, and lived for many days on the\njungle fruits. At last, after they had wandered on for a long while, they came\nto a fine palace which belonged to a Rakshas; but both the Rakshas and his\nwife were out when they got there. Then one of the Princesses said to the\nother, 'This fine palace, in the midst of the jungle, can belong to no one but\na Rakshas; but the owner has evidently gone out; let us go in and see if we\ncan find anything to eat.' So they went into the Rakshas' house, and finding\nsome rice, boiled and ate it. Then they swept the room, and arranged all the\nfurniture in the house tidily. But hardly had they finished doing so, when the\nRakshas and his wife returned home. Then the two Princesses were so frightened\nthat they ran up to the top of the house, and hid themsehres on the flat roof,\nfrom whence they could look down on one side into the inner courtyard of the\nhouse, and from the other could see the open country. The house-top was a\nfavourite resort of the Rakshas and his wife. Here they would sit upon the hot\nsummer evenings; here they winnowed the grain, and hung out the clothes to\ndry; and the two Princesses found a sufficient shelter behind some sheaves of\ncorn that were waiting to be threshed. When the Rakshas came into the house he\nlooked round and said to his wife, 'Somebody has been arranging the house,\neverything in it is so clean and tidy. Wife, did you do this?'--' No,' she\nsaid; 'I don't know who can have done all this.'--' Some one also has been\nsweeping the courtyard,' continued the Rakshas. 'Wife, did you sweep the\ncourtyard? '--' No,' she answered, 'I did not do it. I don't know who did.'\nThen the Rakshas walked round and round several times with his nose up in the\nair, saying, 'Some one is here now. I smell flesh and blood! Where can they\nbe?'--'Stuff and nonsense!' cried his wife. 'You smell flesh and blood,\nindeed! Why, you have just been killing and eating a hundred thousand people.\nI should wonder if you didn't still smell flesh and blood!' They went on\ndisputing the subject, until at last the Rakshas said, 'Well, never mind, I\ndon't know how it is, but I'm very thirsty; let's come, and drink some water.'\nSo both the Rakshas and his wife went to a well which was close to the house,\nand began letting down jars into it, and drawing up the water, and drinking\nit. And the Princesses, who were on the top of the house, saw them. Now the\nyoungest of the two Princesses was. a very wise girl, and when she saw the\nRakshas and his wife by the well, she said to her sister, 'I will do something\nnow that will be good for us both;' and, running down quickly from the top of\nthe house, she crept close behind the Rakshas and his wife, as they stood on\ntiptoe more than half over the side of the well, and, catching hold of one of\nthe Rakshas' heels and one of his wife's, gave each a little push, and down\nthey both tumbled into the well and were drowned, the Rakshas and the Rakshas'\nwife! The Princess then returned to her sister and said, 'I have killed the\nRakshas.'--'What! both?' cried her sister. 'Yes, both, she said. 'Won't they\ncome back?' said her sister. 'No, never,' answered she.\n\nThe Rakshas being thus killed, the two Princesses took. possession of the\nhouse, and lived there very happily for a long, time. In it they found heaps\nand heaps of rich clothes, and jewels, and gold and silver, which the Rakshas\nhad taken from people he had murdered; and all round the house were folds for\nthe flocks, and sheds for the herds of cattle, which the Rakshas had owned.\nEvery morning the youngest Princess used to drive out the flocks~ and herds to\npasturage, and return home with them every night, while the eldest staved at\nhome cooked the dinner and kept the house; and the youngest Princess, who was\nthe cleverest, would often say to her sister on going away for the day, 'Take\ncare if you see any stranger (be it man, woman, or child) come by the house,\nto hide, if possible, that nobody may know of our living here; and if any one\nshould call out and ask for a drink of water, or any poor beggar pray for\nfood, before you give it them be sure you put on ragged clothes, and cover\nyour face with charcoal, and make yourself look as ugly as possible, lest,\nseeing how fair you are, they should steal you away, and we never meet\nagain.'--' Very well,' the other Princess would answer, 'I will do as you\nadvise.'\n\nBut a long time passed, and no one ever came by that way. At last one day,\nafter the youngest Princess had gone out as usual to take the cattle to\npasturage, a young Prince, the son of a neighbouring Rajah, who had been\nhunting with his attendants for many days in the jungles, came near the place\nwhen searching for water (for he and his people were tired with hunting, and\nhad been seeking all through the jungle for a stream of water, but could find\nnone). When the Prince saw the fine palace, standing all by itself; he was\nvery much astonished, and said, 'It is a strange thing that any one should\nhave built such a house as this in the depths of the forest! Let us go in; the\nowners will doubtless give us a drink of water.'--'No, no, do not go,' cried\nhis attendants; 'this is most likely the house of a Rakshas.'--' We can but\nsee,' answered the Prince. 'I should scarcely think anything very terrible\nlived here, for there is not a sound stirring, nor a living creature to be\nseen.' So he began tapping at the door, which was bolted, and crying, 'Will\nwhoever owns this house give me and my people some water to drink, for the\nsake of kind charity?' But nobody answered, for the Princess, who heard him,\nwas busy up in her room, blacking her face with charcoal, and covering her\nrich dress with rags. Then the Prince got impatient, and shook the door,\nsaying angrily, 'Let me in, whoever you are! If you don't I'll force the door\nopen.' At this the poor little Princess got dreadfully frightened; and having\nblacked her face, and made herself look as ugly as possible, she ran\ndownstairs with a pitcher of water, and unbolting the door, gave the Prince\nthe pitcher to drink from; but she did not speak, for she was afraid. Now the\nPrince was a very clever man, and as he raised the pitcher to his mouth to\ndrink the water, he thought to himself; 'This is a very strange-looking\ncreature who has brought me this jug of water. She would be pretty, but that\nher face seems to want washing, and her dress also is very untidy. What can\nthat black stuff on her face and hands be? it looks very unnatural' And so\nthinking to himself; instead of drinking the water, he threw it in the\nPrincess's face! The Princess started back with a little cry, whilst the\nwater, trickling down her face, washed off the charcoal, and showed her\ndelicate features and beautiful fair complexion. The Prince caught hold of her\nhand, and said, 'Now tell me true, who are you? where do you come from? Who\nare your father and mother? and why are you here alone by yourself in the\njungle? Answer me, or I'll cut your head off.' And he made as though he would\ndraw his sword. The Princess was so terrified she could hardly speak, but, as\nbest she could, she told how she was the daughter of a Rajah, and had run away\ninto the jungle because of her cruel stepmother, and finding the house, had\nlived there ever since; and having finished her story, she began to cry. Then\nthe Prince said to her, 'Pretty lady, forgive me for my roughness; do not\nfear; I will take you home with me, and you shall be my wife.' But the more he\nspoke to her the more frightened she got,--so frightened that she did not\nunderstand what he said, and coulu do nothing but cry. Now she had said\nnothing to the Prince about her sister, nor even told him that she had one,\nfor she thought, 'This man says he will kill me; if he hears that I have a\nsister, they will kill her too.' So the Prince, who was really kind-hearted,\nand would never have thought of separating the two little sisters,, who had\nbeen together so long, knew nothing at all of the matter, and only seeing she\nwas too much alarmed even to understand gentle words, said to his servants,\n'Place this lady in one of the, palkees, and let us set off home.' And they\ndid so.\n\nWhen the Princess found herself shut up in the palkee and being carned she\nknew not where, she thought how terrible it would be for her sister to return\nhome and find her gone, and determined, if possible, to leave some sign to\nshow her which way she had been taken Round her neck were many strings of\npearls. She untied them, and tearing her saree into little bits, tied one\npearl in each piece of the saree, that it might be heavy enough to fall\nstraight to the ground; and so she went on, dropping off one pearl and then\nanother, and another, and another, all the way she went along, until they\nreached the palace, where the Rajah and Ranee, the Prince's father and mother,\nlived. She threw the Iast remaining pearl down just as she reached the palace\ngate.\n\nThe old Rajah and Ranee were delighted to see the beautiful Princess their son\nhad brought home; and when they heard her story they said, 'Ah, poor thing!\nwhat a sad story; but now she has come to live with us, we will do all we can\nto make her happy.' And they married her to their son with great pomp and\nceremony, and gave her rich dresses and jewels, and were very kind to her. But\nthe Princess remained sad and unhappy, for she was always thinking about her\nsister, and yet she could not summon courage to beg the Prince or his father\nto send and fetch her to the palace.\n\nMeantime the youngest Princess, who had been out with her flocks and herds\nwhen the Prince took her sister away, had returned home. When she came back\nshe found the door wide open, and no one standing there. She thought it very\nodd, for her sister always came every night to the door, to meet her on her\nreturn. She went upstairs; her sister was not there; the whole house was empty\nand deserted. There she must stay all alone, for the evening had closed in,\nand it was impossible to go outside and seek her with any hope of success. So\nall the night long she waited, crying, 'Some one has been here, and they have\nstolen her away: they have stolen my darling away. O sister! sister!' Next\nmorning, very early, going out to continue the search, she found one of the\npearls belonging to her sister's necklace tied up in a small piece of saree; a\nlittle further on lay another, and yet another, all along the road the Prince\nhad gone. Then the Princess understood that her sister had left this clue to\nguide her on her way, and she at once set off to find her again. Very, very\nfar she went--a six months' journey through the jungle--for she could not\ntravel fast, the many days' walking tired her so much, and sometimes it took\nher two or three days to find the next piece of saree with the pear. At last\nshe came near a large town, to which it was evident her sister had been taken.\nNow this young Princess was very beautiful indeed--as beautiful as she was\nwise,--and when she got near the town she thought to herself; 'If people see\nme they may steal me away as they did my sister, and then I shall never find\nher again. I will therefore disguise myself.' As she was thus thinking she saw\nby the side of the road the skeleton of a poor old beggar-woman, who had\nevidently died from want and poverty. The body was shrivelled up, and nothing\nof it remained but the skin and bones. The Princess took the skin and washed\nit, and drew it on over her own lovely face and neck, as one draws a glove on\none's hand. Then she took a long stick and began hobbling along, leaning on\nit, towards the town.\n\nThe old woman's skin was all crumpled and withered, and people who passed by\nonly thought, 'What an ugly old woman!' and never dreamed of the false skin\nand the beautiful, handsome girl inside. So on she went, picking up the pearls\n--one here, one there--until she found the last pearl just in front of the\npalace gate. Then she felt certain her sister must be somewhere near, but\nwhere, she did not know. She longed to go in to the palace and ask for her,\nbut no guards would have let such a wretched-looking old woman enter, and she\ndid not dare offer them any of the pearls she had with her, lest they should\nthink she was a thief. So she determined merely to remain as close to the\npalace as possible, and wait till fortune favoured her with the means of\nlearning something further about her sister. Just opposite the palace was a\nsmall house belonging to a farmer, and the Princess went up to it, and stood\nby the door. The farmer's wife saw her and said, 'Poor old woman, who are you?\nwhat do you want? why are you here? have you no friends?'--' Alas! no,'\nanswered the Princess. 'I am a poor old woman, and have neither father nor\nmother, son nor daughter, sister nor brother, to take care of me; all are\ngone! and I can only beg my bread from door to door.'\n\n'Do not grieve, good mother,' answered the farmer's wife kindly. 'You may\nsleep in the shelter of our porch, and I will give you some food.' So the\nPrincess stayed there for that night and for many more: and every day the good\nfarmer's wife gave her food. But all this time she could learn nothing of her\nsister.\n\nNow there was a large tank near the palace, on which grew some fine lotus\nplants, covered with rich crimson lotuses--the royal flower--and of these the\nRajah was very fond indeed, and prized them very much. To this tank (because\nit was the nearest to the farmer's house) the Princess used to go every\nmorning, very early, almost before it was light, at about three o'clock, and\ntake off the old woman's skin and wash it, and hang it out to dry; and wash\nher face and hands, and bathe her feet in the cool water, and comb her\nbeautiful hair. Then she would gather a lotus-flower (such as she had been\naccustomed to wear in her hair from a child) and put it on, so as to feel for\na few minutes like herself once more! Thus she would amuse herself.\nAfterwards, as soon as the wind had dried the old woman's skin, she put it on\nagain, threw away the lotus-flower, and hobbled back to the farmer's' door\nbefore the sun was up.\n\nAfter a time the Rajah discovered that some one had plucked some of his\nfavourite lotus-flowers. People were set to watch, and all the wise men in the\nkingdom put their heads together to try and discover the thief; but without\navail. At last, the excitement about this matter being very great, the Rajah's\nsecond son, a brave and noble young Prince (brother to him who had found the\neldest Princess in the forest) said, 'I will certainly discover the thief.' It\nchanced that several fine trees grew round the tank. Into one of these the\nyoung Prince climbed one evening (having made a sort of light thatched roof\nacross two of the boughs, to keep off the heavy dews), and there he watched\nall the night through, but with no more success than his predecessors. There\nlay the lotus plants, still in the moonlight, without so much as a thieving\nwind coming by to break off one of the flowers. The Prince began to get very\nsleepy, and thought the delinquent, whoever he might be, could not intend to\nreturn, when, in the very early morning, before it was light, who should come\ndown to the tank but an old woman he had often seen near the palace gate.\n'Aha!' thought the Prince 'this then is the thief; but what can this queer old\nwoman want with lotus-flowers?' Imagine his astonishment when the old woman\nsat down on the steps of the tank and began pulling the skin off her face and\narms! and from underneath the shrivelled yellow skin came the loveliest face\nhe had ever beheld! So fair, so fresh, so young, so gloriously beautiful, that\nappearing thus suddenly it dazzled the Prince's eyes like a flash of golden\nlightning! 'Ah,' thought he, 'can this be a woman or a spirit? a devil, or an\nangel in disguise?'\n\nThe Princess twisted up her glossy black hair; and, plucking a red lotus,\nplaced it in it, and dabbled her feet in the water, and amused herself by\nputting round her neck a string of the pearls that had been her sister's\nnecklace. Then, as the sun was rising, she threw away the lotus, and covering\nher face and arms again with the withered skin, went hastily away. When the\nPrince got home the first thing he said to his parents was, 'Father, mother; I\nshould like to marry that old woman who stands all day at the farmer's gate,\njust opposite.'--' What!' cried they, 'the boy is mad! Marry that skinny old\nthing? You cannot--you are a King's son. Are there not enough Queens and\nPrincesses in the world, that you should wish to marry a wretched old beggar\nwoman?' But he answered, 'Above all things I should like to marry that old\nwoman. You know that I have ever been a dutiful and obedient son. In this\nmatter, I pray you, grant me my desire.' Then seeing he was really in earnest\nabout the matter, and that nothing they could say would alter his mind, they\nlistened to his urgent entreaties, not, however, without much grief and\nvexation; and sent out the guards, who fetched the old woman (who was really\nthe Princess in disguise) to the palace, where she was married to the Prince\nas privately, and with as little ceremony, as possible, for the family were\nashamed of the match.\n\nAs soon as the wedding was over, the Prince said to his wife, 'Gentle wife,\ntell me how much longer you intend to wear that old skin? You had better take\nit off; do be so kind.' The Princess wondered how he knew of her disguise, or\nwhether it was only a guess of his: and she thought, 'If I take this ugly skin\noff, my husband will think me pretty, and shut me up in the palace and never\nlet me go away, so that I shall not be able to find my sister again. No, I had\nbetter not take it off.' So she answered, 'I don't know what you mean. I am as\nall these years have made me; nobody can change their skin.' Then the Prince\npretended to be very angry, and said, 'Take off that hideous disguise this\ninstant, or I'll kill you.' But she only bowed her head, saying, 'Kill me,\nthen, but nobody can change their skin.' And all this she mumbled as if she\nwere a very old woman indeed, and had lost all her teeth and could not speak\nplain. At this the Prince laughed very much to himself, and thought, 'I'll\nwait and see how long this freak lasts.' But the Princess continued to keep on\nthe old woman's skin; only every morning, at about three o'clock, before it\nwas light, she would get up and wash it and put it on again. Then some time\nafterwards the Prince, having found this out, got up softly one morning early,\nand followed her to the next room, where she had washed the skin and placed it\non the floor to dry, and stealing it, he ran away with it, and threw it on\nthe.~ fire. So the Princess, having no old woman's skin to put on, was obliged\nto appear in her own likeness. As she walked forth, very sad at missing her\ndisguise, her husband ran to meet her, smiling and saying, 'How do you do, my\ndear? Where is your skin now? Can't you take it off, dear?' Soon the whole\npalace had heard the joyful news of the beautiful young wife that the Prince\nhad won and all the people, when they saw her, cried, 'Why, she is exactly\nlike the beautiful Princess our young Rajah married, the jungle-lady.' The old\nRajah and Ranee were prouder than all of their daughter-in-law. and took her\nto introduce her to their eldest son's wife. Then no sooner did the Princess\nenter her sister-in-law's room, than she saw that in her she had found her\nlost sister, and they ran into each other's arms! Great then was the joy of\nall, but the happiest of all these happy people were the two Princesses. and\nthey lived together in peace and joy their whole lives long.\n\n![](img/37.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XVIII.
