On the (three) naturally-perforated (bricks) he (the Sacrificer)\nsings samans; for the naturally-perforated ones are these (three) worlds; and\nthey\n\np. 145\n\nare just these (ordinary) stones. The gods, having laid them down, saw them as\nsuch: that they were dry stones.\n\n8:7:4:22\\. They spake, 'Think ye upon this, how we may lay sap, the means of\nsubsistence, into these worlds!' They spake, 'Meditate ye!' whereby,\ndoubtless, they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer! seek ye how we may lay sap,\nthe means of subsistence, into these worlds!'\n\n8:7:4:33\\. Whilst meditating, they saw these samans (hymn-tunes), and sang\nthem; and by means of them they laid sap, the means of subsistence, into these\nworlds; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now, when he sings these\nsamans, lay sap, the means of subsistence, into these worlds.\n\n8:7:4:44\\. Over the naturally-perforated ones he sings them: the naturally-\nperforated ones being these worlds, it is into these worlds that he thereby\nlays sap, the means of subsistence.\n\n8:7:4:55\\. He sings (the tunes) on the (mystic) words 'Bhus, Bhuvas,\nSvar';--bhus (earth), doubtless, is this world, bhuvas is the air-world, and\nsvar (light) is yonder world: into these worlds he thereby lays sap, the means\nof subsistence.\n\n8:7:4:66\\. They have different preludes, and the same finale 1; and as to\ntheir having different preludes, it\n\np. 146\n\nis because they (the gods) saw them separately; and as to their having the\nsame finale (nidhana), it is because there is only one foundation, only one\nfinale to the sacrifice--even heaven: therefore they have 'svar- _g_ yotis\n(heaven-light)' for their finale.\n\n8:7:4:77\\. He then bestrews him (Agni, the fire-altar and Agni's body) with\nchips of gold. Now that whole Agni had been completed, and the gods bestowed\non him immortality, that highest form; and in like manner does this one now\nbestow upon him that highest, immortal form 1.\n\n8:7:4:88\\. And, again, as to why he bestrews him with chips of gold. Now on\nthat former occasion he first lays into him that pleasing form, the gold plate\nand the (gold) man 2; and he now decks him all over with a pleasing form.\n\n8:7:4:99\\. With two hundred (chips he bestrews him) each time,--two-footed is\nthe Sacrificer, and Agni\n\np. 147\n\nis the sacrificer: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so\nmuch he thus bestows upon him immortality, that highest form. Five times (he\nstrews),--five-layered is the altar, five seasons make a year, and Agni is the\nyear: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus\nbestows upon him immortality, that highest form. With a thousand (chips he\nbestrews him),--a thousand means everything: with everything he thus confers\nupon him immortality, that highest form.\n\n8:7:4:1010\\. First (he scatters them) at the back whilst standing with his\nface towards the east; then on the left (north) side towards the south; then\nin front whilst facing the west; then, having gone round the back, from the\nsouth whilst facing the north: this is from left to right (sunwise), for that\nis (the way) with the gods. Then, having gone round, (he scatters chips) at\nthe back whilst standing with his face to the east, for in this way that\nformer performance of him 1 took place.\n\n8:7:4:1111\\. [He scatters, with, Va _g_. S. XV, 65], 'The fore-measure of a\nthousand thou art,--The counter-measure of a thousand thou art,--The up-\nmeasure of a thousand thou art,--The thousandfold thou art,--For a thousand\nthee!'--a thousand, doubtless, means everything: thus, 'Everything thou art,--\nthee for everything!'\n\n8:7:4:1212\\. Now, then, the consideration of the layer-fillings. The first\nlayer is this (terrestrial) world; and the filling of soil means cattle: thus,\nin\n\np. 148\n\ncovering the first layer with a filling of soil he covers this (terrestrial)\nworld with cattle.\n\n8:7:4:1313\\. The second layer is the air, and the filling of soil means birds:\nthus, in covering the second layer with a filling of soil, he covers (fills)\nthe air with birds.\n\n8:7:4:1414\\. The third layer is the sky, and the filling of soil means stars;\nthus, in covering the third layer with a filling of soil, he covers the sky\nwith stars.\n\n8:7:4:1515\\. The fourth layer is the sacrifice, and the filling of soil means\nsacrificial gifts: thus, in covering the fourth layer with a filling of soil,\nhe covers the sacrifice with sacrificial gifts (to the priests).\n\n8:7:4:1616\\. The fifth layer is the Sacrificer, and the filling of soil means\nprogeny (or subjects) thus, in covering the fifth layer with a filling of\nsoil, he covers (abundantly supplies) the Sacrificer with progeny (or\nsubjects).\n\n8:7:4:1717\\. The sixth layer is the heavenly world, and the filling of soil\nmeans the gods: thus in covering the sixth layer with a filling of soil, he\nfills the heavenly world with gods.\n\n8:7:4:1818\\. The seventh layer is immortality,--that is the last (layer) he\nlays down, and thus bestows immortality as the highest thing of all this\n(universe): therefore immortality is the highest thing of all this (universe);\ntherefore the gods are not separated therefrom; and therefore they are\nimmortal. Thus much as to the deity 1.\n\n8:7:4:1919\\. Now, as to the Self (body). The first layer is the legs, and the\ndownward flowing vital air; and\n\np. 149\n\nthe filling of soil is the flesh: thus, in covering the first layer with a\nfilling of soil, he covers that (part) of his (Agni's) body with flesh. [He\ndoes so] after laying down bricks, and bricks mean bone: he thus covers the\nbone with flesh. He does not cover (the altar-site) below (the first layer),\nwhence these vital airs are not closed up below; but, he covers it above, and\nthereby covers that (part) of his body above with flesh; and hence that (part)\nof his body above, being covered with flesh, is not visible.\n\n8:7:4:2020\\. The second layer is that (part of the body) which is above the\nlegs and below the waist; and the filling of soil is flesh: thus, in covering\nthe second layer with a filling of soil, he covers that (part) of his body\nwith flesh. [He does so] after laying down bricks, and bricks mean bone: he\nthus covers the bone with flesh. He places them on a filling of soil, and\ncovers them with a filling of soil: he thus covers that (part) of his body on\nboth sides with flesh; whence that part of his body, being on both sides\ncovered with flesh, is not visible.\n\n8:7:4:2121\\. The third layer is the waist itself; the fourth layer is that\n(part of the body) which is above the waist and below the neck; the fifth\nlayer is the neck, the sixth layer is the head, and the seventh layer is the\nvital airs. This he lays down as the last (or highest): he thus makes the\nvital airs the highest of all this (universe), and hence the vital airs are\nthe highest thing of all this (universe). He places it on a filling of soil;\nand the filling of soil means flesh; he thus covers (the channels of) the\nvital airs with flesh. He does not cover it above, whence these (channels of\nthe) vital airs are not closed up above.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[145:1](sbe4329.htm#fr_256) These hymn-tunes are given, Sam. Ved. V, p. 487,\nin the way in which they are here to be chanted. They consist entirely of the\nrespective words, separated four times by musical interjections (stobhas)\ninserted between them, ending with the common finale: thus, (r) bhu _h_ \\--bhu\n_h_ \\--hoyi--bhu _h_ \\--hoyi--bhu _h_ \\--ha~uva~e--suvar _g_ yoti~ _h_ ; (2)\nbhuva _h_ \\--bhuva _h_ \\--hoyi--bhuva _h_ \\--ha~uva~e--suvar _g_ yoti~ _h_ ;\n(3) suva _h_ \\--suva _h_ \\--hoyi--suva _h_ \\--hoyi--suva _h_ \\--ha~uva~e--\nsuvar _g_ yoti~ _h_. Along with these, as to be chanted on the same model, are\ngiven, (4) the 'satya _m_ saman,' beginning 'satyam--satyam--hoyi' &c., and p.\n146 (5) the 'purusha-saman,' beginning 'purusha _h_ \\--purusha--hoyi' &c.;\nwhich are similarly chanted by the Sacrificer at the beginning of the first\nlayer, when laying down the lotus leaf (part iii, p. 363, where note 1 should\nbe corrected in accordance with the present note), and the gold man (ib. p.\n369, where the note requires likewise to be corrected), as the ' _k_ itre\ngayati,' 'he sings on the bright one,' of the text cannot refer to the ' _K_\nitra-saman' there referred to. Cf. La _t_ y. S. I, 5, 8.--In regard to these\nsamans (hymn-verses), the text might lead one to suppose that they only\nconsist of two, instead of the usual four parts (omitting the intermediate\nUdgitha and Pratihara, cf. part ii, p. 310 note). The saman being, however,\nsung by the Sacrificer himself, the usual distinction into parts to be\nperformed by different chanters was probably dispensed with.\n\n[146:1](sbe4329.htm#fr_257) That is, the Sacrificer bestows it on Agni; with\nprobably, however, the _double entente_ , 'this Adhvaryu priest bestows it on\nthe Sacrificer.'\n\n[146:2](sbe4329.htm#fr_258) See VII, 4, 1, 10 seq.; 15 seq.\n\n[147:1](sbe4329.htm#fr_259) Viz. of Agni (and the Sacrificer). The ceremony\nalluded to was the fivefold libation of ghee offered on the gold man\n(representing Agni and the Sacrificer), see VII, 4, 1, 34-35.\n\n[148:1](sbe4329.htm#fr_260) That is, so much as to the objects to which the\ndifferent parts of the altar are sacred or dedicated.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IX, 1, 1.
