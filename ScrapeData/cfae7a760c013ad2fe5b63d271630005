And on account of the settled meaning.\n\nThe small ether within cannot denote anything but the highest Lord for this\nreason also, that the word 'ether' has (among other meanings) the settled\nmeaning of 'highest Lord.' Compare, for instance, the sense in which the word\n'ether' is used in _Kh_. Up. VIII, 14, 'He who is called ether is the revealer\nof all forms and names;' and _Kh_. Up. I, 9, 1, 'All these beings take their\nrise from the ether,' &c. On the other hand, we do not meet with any passage\nin which the word 'ether' is used in the sense of 'individual soul.'--We have\nalready shown that the word cannot, in our passage, denote the elemental\nether; for, although the word certainly has that settled meaning, it cannot\nhave it here, because the elemental ether cannot possibly be compared to\nitself, &c. &c.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 18](sbe34087.htm)\n\n"
