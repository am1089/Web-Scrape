Shookdeo, the\nsage, said,--In the mountain Kylas, Kooveru had two sons, named Nul and\nKoover, who, attending upon Sivu, became very rich--One day, accompanied by\ntheir wives, they went into the forest for amusement; and having drank wine\nthere, became intoxicated. Stripping themselves and their wives naked, they\nbegan to bathe in the Ganges, and throwing their arms round each other\'s\nnecks, indulged in various kinds of amatory playfulness, in the midst of\nwhich, Narud, the sage, made his appearance. On seeing him, the women came out\nof the water, and dressed themselves;--but the two men, who were intoxicated,\nremained where they were. Seeing their condition, Narud Jee began to say to\nhimself, "They have become proud on account of their wealth; and for this\nreason, indulge in anger, and amorous sports--A man without wealth has no\npride; and a wealthy man, no thought of\n\np. 46\n\nreligion, or irreligion"--It is said, "that fools having cherished their false\nbodies, (that is, indulging in all sorts of luxury and excess,) forget\nthemselves. At the sight of wealth, and their families (meaning, high\nconnexions,) they are elated--and virtuous men do not entertain any pride of\nwealth in their minds, but regard good and bad fortune alike." Saying this,\nNarud, the sage, pronounced a curse upon them--"For this crime, go to Gokool,\nand become trees; when Shree Krishnu descends upon the earth, he will liberate\nyou." Narud, the sage, thus cursed them, for which reason they came to Gokool,\nand were transformed into trees--and they were named Jumlajoorun.\n\nHaving narrated thus much, Shookdeo Jee said,--O great king! recollecting this\ncircumstance, Shree Krishnu, dragging along the wooden mortar, came to the\nplace in which the trees named Jumlajoorun, were. On going there, having cast\nthe wooden mortar across, between the two great trees, he gave such a sudden\njerk, that the two trees fell down, uprooted; and two very handsome human\nbeings, coming forth from them, and joining their hands, began to sing his\npraises--"O Lord! who, but you, would recollect such great sinners as we are."\nShree Krishnu said, "Narud, the sage, has shown great compassion towards you,\nin having granted you liberation in Gokool; through his beneficence, you have\nobtained me--Now ask from me any boon you wish." Jumlajoorun said, "O lord of\nthe poor! through the favour of Narud Jee, we have touched your feet, and\nobtained a sight of you; we have now no desire of any thing else; but be\npleased to grant this much, that faith in you may always continue in our\nbreasts." On hearing this, Shree Krishnu, having granted what they asked, and\nlaughing, dismissed them.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XII](psa13.htm)\n\n'
