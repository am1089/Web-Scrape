It was made up of twenty-four sections, on (1) the creation of the world; (2) the various kinds of living beings; (3) the extent of the virtuous\n\np. 2\n\ncountry; (4) the constitution of a judicial assembly; (5) the performance of\nofferings according to the Vedas and Veda\xe1\xb9\x85gas; (6) established usage; (7)\nforensic law; (8) the extirpation of offenders; (9) the mode of life of a\nking; (10, 11) the system of the (four) castes and (four) orders; (12)\nmarriage laws; (13) the mutual relations between husband and wife; (14) the\norder of succession; (15) the performance of obsequies; (16) the elucidation\nof difficult points regarding purification; (17) the rule as to what may be\neaten and what not; (18, 19) the law regarding vendible commodities, and those\nwhich must not be sold; (20) the various kinds of crime; (21) heaven and hell;\n(22) penances; (23) the Upanishads; (24) secret doctrines.\n\n2. 2 Holy Manu, after having thus (composed) that (book) in a hundred thousand _s_ lokas, and in one thousand and eighty chapters, delivered it to the divine sage Narada. He having learnt it from him, reflecting that a work of this kind could not be remembered easily by mortals on account of its size, abridged it in twelve thousand ( _s_ lokas) and delivered it to the great sage Marka _n_ _d_ eya.\n\n3. 3 He having learnt it from him, and reflecting on\n\np. 3\n\nthe (limited duration and) capacity of human life, reduced it to eight\nthousand ( _s_ lokas), and delivered this (abridgment) to Sumati, the son of\nBh _ri_ gu.\n\n4. 4 Sumati, the son of Bh _ri_ gu, after having learnt (this book) from him and considered what human capacity had been brought down to through the (successive) lessening of life (in the four ages of the world), reduced it to four thousand ( _s_ lokas).\n\n5. 5 It is this (abridgment) which Manes and mortals read, whilst the gods, Gandharvas, and other (exalted beings) read in extenso the (original) code, consisting of one hundred thousand ( _s_ lokas). There the first _s_ loka runs as follows: 'This universe was wrapped up in darkness, and nothing could be discerned. Then the holy, self-existent Spirit issued forth with his four faces.'\n\n6. 6 After this exordium, chapter follows chapter\n\np. 4\n\ncontinuously. There the ninth chapter is headed, 'Judicial Procedure.' There\nNarada, the divine sage, composed an Introduction in the Sutra style, as\nfollows. It begins with the following _s_ loka.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1:1](sbe3304.htm#fr_18) Regarding the historical value and bearing of this\nPreface, see Introduction. The table of contents, which is here given for the\noriginal Code of Manu, corresponds in the main to the contents of the now\nextant version of that work. Thus the creation of the world is treated of,\nManu I, 5-57; the various kinds of living beings, I, 34-50; the virtuous\ncountries, II, 17-23; the constitution of a judicial assembly, XII, 108-114;\nthe performance of offerings, III, 69-286; IV, 21-28, &c.; established usage\n(\xc3\x82 _k_ ara), passim, all the multifarious rules of private morals and social\neconomy falling under this head; forensic law, chapters VIII and IX; the\nextirpation of offenders, IX, 252-293; the mode of life of a king, chapter\nVII; the system of the four castes and four orders, I, 87-101; IX, 325-336,\n&c.; marriage laws, III, 1-62; the mutual relations between husband and wife,\nIX, 1-103; the order of succession, IX, 103-220; the performance of obsequies,\nIII, 122-286; rules of purification, V, 57-146; rules of diet, V, 1-56;\nsaleable commodities, and those which may not be sold, X, 85-94; the\nclassification of offences, XI, 55-71; the twenty-one hells, IV, 88-90;\npenances, XI, 72- 266. The Upanishads are frequently referred to, e.g. II,\n165; VI, 29. Secret or mysterious doctrines are e.g. those taught in the\ntwelfth chapter of the Code of Manu. A somewhat analogous table of contents of\nthe Code of Manu is given in that work itself, I, 111-118.\n\n[2:2](sbe3304.htm#fr_19) The Manu who is referred to in this place is no doubt\nManu Svaya _m_ bhuva, or 'Manu sprung from the self-existent Being,' to whom\nthe Code of Manu is said to have been revealed by Brahman; see Manu I, 58.\nNarada is one of the seven principal _Ri_ shis. He is also reckoned among the\nPra _g_ apatis, 'lords of creatures' or 'creators,' and is viewed as the chief\nof heavenly musicians. Marka _n_ _d_ eya is elsewhere called 'the long-lived,'\nand is celebrated for his austerities. He is the reputed author of a well-\nknown Pura _n_ a, called after him the Marka _n_ _d_ eya Pura _n_ a.\n\n[2:3](sbe3304.htm#fr_20) Bh _ri_ gu, one of the great _Ri_ shis of antiquity,\nis in the Code of Manu introduced as a son of Manu, and as the compiler of the\np. 3 present version of the Code of Manu; see Manu I, 35, 59, 60. The fact of\nhis being mentioned here as the father of Sumati, the compiler of the final\nrecension of the Code of Manu, renders it probable that this work may have\nclosely resembled the now extant Code of Manu. However, the latter work has\nnot more than 2684 _s_ lokas, instead of the 4000 attributed to the version of\nSumati.\n\n[3:4](sbe3304.htm#fr_21) As for the successive lessening of life, and general\ndeterioration of the world, in the four ages, K _ri_ ta, Treta, Dvapara, and\nKali, see Manu I, 81-86.\n\n[3:5](sbe3304.htm#fr_22) A. observes expressly that the term 'there' refers to\nthe original Code in 100,000 _s_ lokas. The _s_ loka here quoted is nearly\nidentical with Manu I, 5 a, 6 a.\n\n[3:6](sbe3304.htm#fr_23) The Mat _ri_ ka or 'Introduction' (compare divyamat\n_ri_ ka, a 'general introduction to the law regarding ordeals,' in the\nMitakshara, p. 139) which is here attributed to Narada, appears to have formed\npart of the abridgment in 12,000 _s_ lokas, which was originally composed by\nhim. It was composed in the Sutra style, i.e. it was made up of aphorisms. The\n_s_ lokas are frequently designed as Sutras by the commentators of law-books.\nSupposing this work to have consisted of twelve chapters, like the present\nCode p. 4 of Manu, each chapter would have contained about 1000 _s_ lokas. The\nNarada-sm _ri_ ti actually has about 1000 _s_ lokas. In the Code of Manu,\nforensic law is treated in the eighth and ninth chapters. The compiler of the\npresent work declares his composition to be the ninth chapter of Narada's\nabridged version of the Code of Manu. In the above enumeration of twenty-four\nsubjects treated in the original Code of Manu, judicial procedure is\nintroduced as the seventh and eighth subject. This coincidence indeed might be\naccidental.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I. Legal Procedure](sbe3305.htm)\n\n"
