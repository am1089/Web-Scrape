He sprinkles it from before with water in which rice and barley are, with\n(the formula), 'Agreeable to such and such (a deity) I sprinkle thee.'\n\n4\\. Having given (to the animal) to drink of that (water), he should pour out\nthe rest (of it) along its right fore-foot.\n\n5\\. Having carried fire round (it), performing that act only (without\nrepeating a corresponding Mantra), they lead it to the north.\n\n6 6. In front of it they carry a fire-brand.\n\np. 177\n\n7 7 This is the _S_ amitra (fire).\n\n8 8. With the two Vapa _s_ rapa _n_ i ladles the 'performer' touches the\nanimal.\n\n9\\.

At the same fire they cook a mess of food.\n\n12 12. Having cut off the eleven Avadanas (or portions which have to be cut\noff) from the animal, from all its limbs, having boiled them at the _S_ amitra\n(fire),\n\np. 178\n\nand having warmed the heart on a spit, let him sacrifice first from the mess\nof cooked food (mentioned in Sutra 11);\n\n13\\. Or together with the Avadana portions.\n\n14 14. From each of the (eleven) Avadanas he cuts off two portions.\n\n15 15.
