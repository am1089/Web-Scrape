I will now describe how Sutdhunwa\nkilled Suttrajeet, and, taking away the jewel, and giving it to Akroor, fled\nfrom Dwarka, listen with attention. The son of the blind Dritrasht\n(Doorjodhun) invited the Pandoos, and gave them beds in his house; at\nmidnight, he surrounded the house with flames.\n\nOn hearing of this circumstance, the two brothers were greatly grieved and\nperplexed; and ordered the charioteer, Daruk, to bring their chariot, mounting\nwhich, they went to Hustinapoor, and descending entered the court of the\nRoroos, and there beheld them all sitting, emaciated and low-spirited;\nDoorjodhun was thoughtful; Bheekmuk was shedding tears; Dritrasht was in great\naffliction, and tears were even falling from the eyes of Dronacharuj;\nBidooruth Jee was greatly dispirited, and Gundharee was sitting near him. And\nthe other wives of the Roroos, thinking of the Pandoos, continued to weep and\nthe whole court was sad.\n\nO great king! seeing this state of affairs, Shree Krishnu and Bulram Jee went\nand sat near them, and made enquiries regarding the Pandoos: but all remained\nsilent, and would not divulge any thing.\n\np. 252\n\nHaving narrated thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja\nPureechit,--O great king! Shree Krishnu and Bulram Jee, having heard of the\nburning of the Pandoos went to Hustinapoor; and there was in Dwarka a member\nof the family of Judoo, named Sutdhunwa, to whom Sutbhama had been first\nbetrothed. Akroor and Krutbruma went together to him and both said to him,\n"Shree Krishnu and Bulram have gone to Hustinapoor; now is your opportunity,\ntake your revenge upon Suttrajeet; because he has acted very wrongly towards\nyou, in having given a girl, who was betrothed to you, to Shree Krishnu; and,\nin having abused you; there is no one here now to assist him."\n\nOn hearing these words, Sutdhunwa rose in great wrath; and, having gone in the\nnight to the house of Suttrajeet, called out; and at length, having by\nstratagem and force, put him to death, carried away the jewel. After this\nSutdhunwa, sitting alone in his house, began to reflect, and to say to himself\nwith regret, "By listening to Akroor\'s counsel, I have made an enemy of\nKrishnu; Krutbruma and Akroor both came here, and advised me. If a good man\nspeaks deceitfully, what control can any one have over him?"\n\nO great king! whilst Sutdhunwa, thus regretting, repeatedly exclaimed, "No one\nhas power over the future; the events of fate are not known by any one;" the\nwife of Suttrajeet, on beholding her husband lying dead, embraced his corpse,\nand wept and poured forth lamentations.\n\nOn hearing her cries, all her relations, male and female, speaking in a very\nconfused, disjointed manner, began to shed tears and strike their bodies; and\nthere was mourning in the whole house. Having heard of the death of her father\nSutbhama came to where her father was lying; and having offered them all\nadvice and consolation, and washed her father\'s corpse in oil, sent for her\nchariot, and ascending it, went off to Shree Krishnu Chund, the root of joy,\nand arrived after a\n\np. 253\n\njourney of a day and night. Huri rose on seeing her, and enquired, whether all\nwas well at home. Sutbhama replied, joining her hands, "How can things go on\nwell without you, O lord of the Judoos! Sutdhunwa has brought calamity on me,\nby killing my father, and carrying off the jewel; your father-in-law\'s corpse\nis preserved in oil. Remove all my griefs."\n\nHaving thus spoken, Sutbhama Jee stood before Shree Krishnu and Buldeo Jee,\nand exclaiming "Alas, father! alas, father!" began to weep, and groan\nbitterly. On hearing her cries, Shree Krishnu and Bulram were at first very\nsad; and began, after the manner of the world, to shed tears. Afterwards,\nhaving consoled and comforted Sutbhama, they brought her thence with them to\nDwarka.\n\nShree Shookdeo Jee said, O great king! on coming to Dwarka, Shree Krishnu\nChund, perceiving that Sutbhama was very much grieved, made her a promise, and\nsaid, "O beautiful Sutbhama! be of good cheer, and banish all anxiety, what\nwas to happen, has happened; but I will now destroy Sutdhunwa, and revenge\nyour father\'s death, and afterwards perform other acts."\n\nOn the arrival of Shree Krishnu, Sutdhunwa was greatly terrified; and,\nabandoning his home, said to himself, "At the suggestion of others, I have\nmade Shree Krishnu Jee my enemy, whose protection shall I now seek?" He went\nto Krutbruma; and, joining his hands, said with many supplications, "O great\nking! I have acted by your advice, and Shree Krishnu and Bulram are now\nenraged against me, I have, therefore, fled and come to seek an asylum with\nyou, appoint me some place to reside in." Krutbruma replied, "I can do nothing\nfor you; whoever is at enmity with Shree Krishnu Chund, is cut off from the\nrest of mankind. Did you not know, that Krishnu is very powerful; and that you\nwould be a loser by being at enmity with him? What does it signify, who\nadvised you; why did you not act, with\n\np. 254\n\nreference to your own strength? It is customary in the world to contract\nenmities, marriages and friendships with equals. Banish all hope of my being\nable to do any thing for you, as I am a servant of Shree Krishnu Chund, the\nroot of joy, it does not become me to show enmity to him; go somewhere else\nfor protection."\n\nSudhunwa, O great king! was very sad at these words, and went thence to\nAkroor, joining his hands bowing his head, supplicating, and expressing great\nsorrow and regret, he began to say, "Lord! you are the greatest chief among\nthe Judoos; all of them respect and bow their heads to you; you are holy,\nmerciful and resolute; and submitting to afflictions yourself, remove the\ngriefs of others. The shame of having advised me rests with you; grant me your\nprotection, I have done this deed at your suggestion, save me now from the\nhands of Shree Krishnu."\n\nAkroor Jee replied, "You are a great fool, in talking thus to me; do you not\nknow that Shree Krishnu Chund is the creator of all men and the dispeller of\ngriefs? How can anyone remain in the world, who is at enmity with him? What\nevil can befal the adviser? The whole affair is now upon your head. There is a\nsaying, \'That it is the custom of gods, men and sages to form friendships for\nthe furtherance of their own selfish objects.\' And there are many kinds of men\nin the world, who for the sake of their own interests, advise after various\nfashions; it is, therefore, advisable for a man not to act according to the\nopinions of others; but in every affair of life to consider first, what may\nbenefit, and what may do him harm, and then enter upon it. You have\npremeditatedly done this act; and now there is not any refuge for you in the\nworld. Whoever has shown enmity to Krishnu cannot live; to whatever quarter he\nmay fly, he will be destroyed, I do not wish to die, that I should render you\nassistance. Life is dear to all men."\n\np. 255\n\nO great king! when Akroor Jee had made this unpalatable speech to Sutdhunwa,\nhe, being devoid of all hope, and giving up all thoughts of life, left the\njewel with Akroor; and mounting a chariot, fled from the city. Spree Krishnu\nand Bulram pursued him in a chariot; and overtook him after a pursuit of four\nhundred coss. On hearing the sound, of their chariot Sutdhunwa was in great\nalarm; and descending from his chariot, entered the city of Mithila. On seeing\nhim, Krishnu was enraged, and ordered the quoit, Soodursun, to cut off his\nhead, which he did forthwith: and Shree Krishnu Chund went up to him and\nsearched for the jewel; but without success. He then said to Buldeo Jee,\n"Brother! I have killed Sutdhunwa, and not obtained the jewel." Bulram\nreplied, "Brother! some great man must have obtained possession of it, who has\nnot brought it and shown it to us. That jewel cannot possibly be concealed;\nwait a little, and it will turn up somewhere." Buldeo Jee proceeded to say,\n"Brother! set out now for Dwarka, and I will go and search for the jewel;\nwhich I will bring with me, wherever I may find it."\n\nHaving proceeded thus far in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the\nRaja Pureechit,--O great king! Shree Krishnu Chund, the root of joy, having\nkilled Sutdhunwa, started for Dwarka; and Bulram, the abode of happiness, set\nout to search for the jewel. After having searched in various countries,\ncities and villages, Buldeo Jee went to the city of Ajoodiya. On receiving\nintelligence of his arrival, Doorjodhun, the Raja of Ajoodiya rose up, and\nhaving advanced with presents to meet him, escorted Bulram with music playing,\nand in silken clothes to his own palace. Having seated him on a throne, and\ngone through various forms of adoration, he entertained him: and standing in\nhis presence, said, with joined hands and bended head and great humility of\nmanner, "O sea of compassion! please inform me, how you came here?"\n\nO great king! Buldeo Jee, observing his affection, was delighted, and\nexplained all the particulars of his journey.\n\np. 256\n\n[paragraph continues] After hearing the account, Raja Doorjodhun said, "Lord!\nno one will be able to keep that jewel concealed: it will be manifested of\nitself at some time or other." He again said, with joined hands, "O kind to\nthe poor! great is my good fortune in having obtained a sight of you at my own\nhome, and having thereby obliterated the sins of every preceding birth. Do me\nthe kindness now to gratify your servant\'s desire; and, remaining here some\ndays, make me your pupil, and obtain celebrity in the world by instructing me\nin the art of fighting with clubs."\n\nO great king! having heard this speech, Bulram Jee made Doorjodhun his pupil;\nand, staying a few days, instructed him in the science of fighting with the\nclub; but although he made search throughout the city, he did not find the\njewel. Some days after the arrival of Shree Krishnu Chund at Dwarka, Bulram\narrived also; when having taken all the Judoos with him, and brought forth\nSuttrajeet\'s corpse from the oil, Shree Krishnu Chund Jee made a purification\nof fire and lighted the funeral pile with his own hands. When Shree Krishnu\nJee had performed the funeral obsequies, Akroor and Krutbruma, consulting with\neach other, went to Shree Krishnu; and, having taken him aside and shown him\nthe jewel, said, "O great king! the Judoos have become impious, and fascinated\nby riches, they have become blinded by wealth, and given up all thought and\nmeditation and memory of you. If they were now to suffer some affliction, they\nwould return to your service. We will, therefore, take away the jewel and fly\nfrom the city; and when we have revived in them the adoration and memory of\nyou, we will return to Dwarka." Akroor and Krutbruma, with all their\nrelations, fled from Dwarka at midnight, with the knowledge of Shree Krishnu,\nand no one knew in what direction they had gone. Early in the morning, there\nwas a report throughout the city, that they had gone off somewhere during the\nnight; but no one knew where and what was the cause of their going.\n\np. 257\n\nHaving recited thus much, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great king! this was a\nconstant and general topic of conversation in the city; whilst on the other\nhand, Akroor Jee first went to Prag, and, having caused himself to be shaved,\nbathed at the confluence of the three sacred rivers, and presented many gifts;\nand having performed many acts of charity, built a ghaut in honour of Huri,\nand went to Gyah; there, sitting on the bank of the river Phulgoo, they\nperformed funeral obsequies in the manner prescribed by the Shastrus; and,\nhaving feasted the brahmins of Gyah, gave many gifts. Having afterwards\nvisited a temple of Vishnu, they went thence to the city of Kasi. Hearing of\ntheir arrival, all the neighbouring Rajas came with presents to meet them; and\nthey remained there offering sacrifices and presents, and performing acts of\npenance and fasting.\n\nSome days having elapsed, Shree Moorari, the friend of his worshippers,\ndetermined to send for Akroor Jee; and coming to Bulram, said, "Brother! bring\nsome calamity on the inhabitants of the city, and send for Akroor." Buldeo\nreplied, "O great king! do whatever is most agreeable to yourself, and confer\nhappiness on virtuous men." When Bulram had thus spoken, Shree Krishnu Chund\ncaused fevers and diseases of all kinds to rage in the city of Dwarka.\n\nDuring four months, there was no rain; in consequence of which, all the\nrivers, nullahs and tanks of the city were dried up: grass and grain were not\nproduced; birds, fishes, beasts and all animals with life and cattle were\ngreatly distressed, and died of drought. The inhabitants of the city, through\nhunger, began to raise cries to heaven for deliverance. At length, all the\nmale and female population were in a state of the greatest consternation; and\ncame to Shree Krishnu Chund, the extirpater of grief; and imploring him\nearnestly and beseeching him with the utmost humility, began to say, with\njoined hands, and bowing their heads, "We have come to you to seek an asylum;\nhow shall we be able to endure our great calamities?\n\np. 258\n\n[paragraph continues] We are sorely afflicted from the want of rain; why has\nBruhmu brought this disaster upon us?" They proceeded to say, "O compassionate\nlord of Dwarka! you are our creator and dispeller of our griefs; to whom else\nshall we go and address our petitions? Whence has this misery fallen upon us,\nwhilst we were living quietly at our homes, and why has it happened, kindly\nexplain to us?"\n\nShree Shookdeo, the sage said,--O great king! on hearing these words, Shree\nKrishnu Chund replied, "Famine, misery and distress make their entrance into\nevery city, which holy men have abandoned. Since Akroor Jee has departed\nhence, you have endured this state of calamity. Where holy men, lovers of\ntruth and servants of Huri dwell, there evil and want, and misfortune cannot\nexist. Indru has a friendship for the worshippers of Huri; and, therefore,\nrain falls plentifully in the cities where they dwell."\n\nAll the Judoos exclaimed, "O great king! you have spoken truly: this thought\nhad occurred to us also, because Akroor\'s father\'s name is Soophulluk, and he\ntoo is a very holy, truth-loving and just man. Where he dwells, there\ndistress, poverty and famine have no existence; but rain falls frequently, in\nconsequence of which, the seasons are prosperous and abundant. At one time,\nthere was a terrible famine in the city of Kasi, when the Raja thereof sent\nfor Soophulluk. O great king! on the arrival of Soophulluk, rain fell\ncopiously, and as much as was desired; and there was a plenteous season, and\nan end to all their misery. After this, the Raja of Kasi gave his daughter in\nmarriage to Soophulluk, who dwelt there happily. This Raja\'s daughter\'s name\nwas Gadinka, whose son Akroor is." They went on to say, "O great king! we were\naware of this before, and will now do whatever you order."\n\nShree Krishnu Chund replied, "Behave with the greatest respect to Akroor Jee,\nand bring him back here, wherever you may find him."\n\np. 259\n\nOn receiving this injunction, the Judoos went forth in a body to search for\nAkroor; and pursuing their search, arrived at the city of Baransee, (Benares).\nHaving had a meeting with Akroor Jee, and presented gifts, they stood before\nhim with joined hands, and bending their heads forward said, "Return home, O\nlord! Bulram and Krishnu have sent for you: the inhabitants of the city have\nbeen troubled during your absence. Where you are, there happiness dwells, and\nwhere you are not, calamity and distress take up their abode. A grievous\nfamine has fallen upon the city, although Shree Gopal (Krishnu) dwelt there.\nThe husband of Luchmee (Vishnu) is subservient to holy men; from them, all\nmortals derive wealth and happiness."\n\nO great king! on hearing these words, Akroor Jee rose up to depart in great\nagitation; and arrived, after some days, at Dwarka, accompanied by his\nrelations, Krutbruma, and the members of the family of Judoo, with music\nplaying during the journey.\n\nHaving received news of his arrival, and going out to meet him, Shree Krishnu\nand Bulram escorted him to the city with the greatest dignity and honour. O\nRaja! rain fell on the entrance of Akroor Jee into the city, and there was\nabundance. All the distress and want that had been raging, disappeared. Akroor\nwas greatly exalted; and the inhabitants of Dwarka began to rejoice and\nindulge in festivities.\n\nOn a subsequent day, Shree Krishnu Chund, the root of joy, sent for Akroor\nJee, and taking him aside said, "What have you done with Suttrajeet\'s jewel?"\nHe replied, "I still have it." Krishnu said, "Restore it to its owner; and if\nhe should not be alive, make it over to his son. If there should not be a son,\ngive it to his wife: and if there should not be a wife, give it to his\nbrother: and if there should not be a brother, give it to a relation: in\ndefault of relations, give it to his spiritual preceptor\'s son: and if there\nshould not be a son of the spiritual preceptor, give it to a brahmin. But do\nnot\n\np. 260\n\nreceive yourself any man\'s wealth. This is equity; wherefore, it is right that\nyou give the jewel to Suttrajeet\'s grandson, and obtain a great name in the\nworld by doing so." O great king! when Shree Krishnu Chund had thus spoken,\nAkroor Jee took the jewel, and placing it before Krishnu, joining his hands\nsaid in a very supplicating manner, "O lord of the poor! be pleased to accept\nthis jewel yourself, and forgive my fault; because I have expended in the\ncourse of my pilgrimage the gold which the jewel yielded." Krishnu assented,\nand went and presented the jewel to Sutbhama, and removed all the anxieties of\nher mind.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LIX](psa60.htm)\n\n'
