 \nAnd tambour shell and drum pealed out,  \nAnd joyful was each giant's shout.  \nA mighty host, with eyeballs red  \nLike flames of kindled fire, he led.  \nHe passed the city gate, and viewed,  \nArrayed, the Vanar multitude,  \nThose wielding massy rocks, and these  \nArmed with the stems of uptorn trees,  \nAnd Rama with his eyes aglow  \nWith warlike ardour viewed the foe,  \nAnd thus the brave Vibhishan, best  \nOf weapon-wielding chiefs, addressed:  \n'What captnin leads this bright array  \nWhere lances gleam and banners play,  \nAnd thousands armed with spear and sword  \nAwait the bidding of their lord?'  \n\n'Seest, thou,' Vibhishan answered, 'one  \nWhose face is as the morning sun,  \nPreeminent for hugest frame?  \nAkampan  1 is the giant's name  \nBehold that chieftain, chariot-borne,  \nWhom Brahma's chosen gifts adorn.  \nHe wields a bow like Indra's own;  \nA lion on his flag is shown,  \nHis eyes with baleful fire are lit:  \n'Tis Ravan's son,'tis Indrajit  \nThere, brandishing in mighty hands  \nHis huge bow, Atikaya stands.  \nAnd that proud warrior o'er whose head  \nA moon-bright canopy is spread:  \nWhose might, in many a battle tried,  \nHas tamed imperial Indra's pride;  \nWho wears a crown of burnished gold,  \nIs Lanka's lord the lofty-souled.'  \n\nHe ceased: and Rama knew his foe,  \nAnd laid an arrow on his bow:  \n'Woe to the wretch,' he ciied, 'whom fate  \nAbandons to my deadly hate.'  \nHe spoke, and, firm by Lakshman's side,  \nThe giant to the fray defied.  \n\nThe lord of Lanka bade his train  \nOf warriors by the gates remain,  \nTo guard the city from surprise  \nBy Rama's forest born allies.  \nThen as some monster of the sea  \nCleaves swift-advancimg billows, he  \nCharged with impetuous onset through  \nThe foe, and cleft the host in two.  \nSugriva ran, the king to meet:  \nA hill uprooted from its seat  \nHe hurled,with trees that graced the height  \nAgainst the rover of the night:  \nBut cleft with shafts that checked its way  \nHarmless upon the earth it lay.  \nThen fiercer Ravan's fury grew,  \nAn arrow from his side he drew,  \nSwift as a thunderbolt, aglow  \nWith fire, and launched it at the foe.  \nThrough flesh and bone a way it found,  \nAnd stretched Sugriva on the ground.  \nSushen and Nala saw him fall,  \nGavaksha, Gavaya heard their call,  \nAnd, poising hills, in act * to fling  \nThey charged amain the giant king.  \nThey charged, they hurled the hills in vain.  \nHe checked them with his arrowy rain,  \nAnd every brave assailant felt  \nThe piercing wounds his missiles dealt,  \nThen smitten by the shafts that came  \nKeen, fleet, and thick, with certain aim,  \nThey fled to Rama, sure defence  \nAgainst the oppressor's violence,  \nThen, reverent palm to palm applied,  \nThus Lakshman to his brother cried:  \n'To me, my lord, the task entrust  \nTo lay this giant in the dust.'  \n'Go, then,' said Rama, 'bravely fight;  \nBeat down this rover of the night.  \nBut he, unmatched in bold emprise.  \nFears not the Lord of earth and skies,  \nKeep on thy guard: with keenest eye  \nThy moments of attack espy.  \nLet hand and eye in due accord  \nProtect thee with the bow and sword.'  \n\nThen Lakshman round his brother threw  \nHis mighty arms in honour due,  \nBent lowly down his reverent head,  \nAnd onward to the battle sped.  \nHanuman from afar beheld  \nHow Ravan's shafts the Vanars quelled:  \nTo meet the giant's car he ran,  \nRaised his right arm and thus began:  \n'If Brahma's boon thy life has screened  \nFrom Yaksha, God, Gandharva, fiend.  \nWith these contending fear no ill,  \nBut tremble at a Vanar still.'  \nWith fury flashing from his eye  \nThe lord of Lanka made reply.  \n'Strike, Vanar, strike, the fray begin,  \nAml hope eternal fame to win  \nThis arm shall pr * thee in the * ??  \n\np. 469  \n\nAnd end thy glory and thy life.'  \n'Remember,' cried the Wind-God's son,  \n'Remember all that I have done,  \nMy prowess, King, thou knowest well,  \nShown in the fight when Aksha  1 fell.'  \n   With heavy hand the giant smote  \nHanuman on the chest and throat,  \nWho reeled and staggered to and fro,  \nStunned for a moment by the blow.  \nTill, mustering strength, his hand he reared  \nAnd struck the foe whom Indra feared.  \nHis huge limbs bent beneath the shock,  \nAs mountains, in an earthquake, rock,  \nAnd from the Gods and sages pealed  \nShouts of loud triumph as he reeled.  \nBut strength returning nerved his frame:  \nHis eyeballs flashed with fiercer flame.  \nNo living creature might resist  \nThat blow of his tremendous fist  \nWhich fell upon Hanuman's flank:  \nAnd to the ground the Vanar sank,  \nNo sign of life his body showed:  \nAnd Ravan in his chariot rode  \nAt Nila; and his arrowy rain  \nEell on the captain and his train.  \nFierce Nila stayed his Vanar band,  \nAnd, heaving with his single hand  \nA mountain peak with vigorous swing  \nHurled the huge missile at the king.  \n   Hanuman life and strength regained,  \nBurned for the fight and thus complained:  \n'Why, coward giant, didst thou flee  \nAnd leave the doubtful fight with me?'  \nSeven mighty arrows keen and fleet  \nThe giant launched, the hill to meet;  \nAnd, all its force and fury stayed,  \nThe harmless mass on earth was laid.  \nEnraged the Vanar chief beheld  \nThe mountain peak by force repelled,  \nAnd rained upon the foe a shower  \nOf trees uptorn with branch and flower.  \nStill his keen shafts which pierced and rent  \nEach flying tree the giant sent:  \nStill was the Vanar doomed to feel  \nThe tempest of the winged steel.  \nThen, smarting from that arrowy storm,  \nThe Vanar chief condensed his form,  2  \nAnd lightly leaping from the ground  \nOn Ravan's standard footing found;  \nThen springing unimpeded down  \nStood on his bow and golden crown.  \nThe Vanar's nimble leaps amazed  \nIkshvaku's son who stood and gazed.  \nThe giant, raging in his heart,  \n\nLaid on his bow a fiery dart;  \nThe Vanar on his flagstaff eyed,  \nAnd thus in tones of fury cried:  \n'Well skilled in magic lore art thou:  \nBut will thine art avail thee now?  \nSee if thy magic will defend  \nThy life against the dart I send.'  \n   Thus Ravan spake, the giant king,  \nAnd loosed the arrow from the string.  \nIt pierced, with direst fury sped,  \nThe Vanar with its flaming head.  \nHis father's might, his power innate  \nPreserved him from the threatened fate.  \nUpon his knees he fell, distained  \nWith streams of blood, but life remained,  \n   Still Ravan for the battle burned:  \nAt Lakshman next his car he turned,  \nAnd charged amain with furious show,  \nStraining in mighty hands his bow.  \n'Come,' Lakshman cried, 'assay the fight:  \nLeave foes unworthy of thy might.'  \nThus Lakshman spoke: and Lanka's lord  \nHeard the dread thunder of the cord,  \nAnd mad with burning rage and pride  \nIn hasty words like these replied:  \n'Joy, joy is mine, O Raghu's son:  \nThy fate to-day thou canst not shun.  \nSlain by mine arrows thou shalt tread  \nThe gloomy pathway of the dead.'  \n   Thus as, he spoke his bow he drew,  \nAnd seven keen shafts at Lakshman flew,  \nBut Raghu's son with surest aim  \nCleft every arrow as it came.  \nThus with fleet shafts each warrior shot  \nAgainst his foe, and rested not.  \nThen one choice weapon from his store,  \nBy Brahma's self bestowed of yore,  \nFierce as the flames that end the world,  \nThe giant king at Lakshman hurled.  \nThe hero fell, and racked with pain,  \nScarce could his hand his bow retain.  \nBut sense and strength resumed their seat  \nAnd, lightly springing to his feet,  \nHe struck with one Tremendons stroke  \nAnd Ravan's bow in splinters broke.  \nFrom Lakshmans's cord three arrows flew  \nAnd pierced the giant monarch through.  \nSore wounded Ravan closed, and round  \nIkshvaku's son his strong arms wound.  \nWith strength unrivalled, Brahma's gift,  \nHe strove from earth his foe to lift.  \n'Shall I,' he cried, 'who overthrow  \nMount Meru and the Lord of Snow,  \nAnd heaven and all who dwell therein,  \nBe foiled by one of Rama's kin?'  \nBut though he heaved, and toiled, and strained,  \nUnmoved Ikshvaku's son remained.  \nHis frame by those huge arms compressed  \nThe giant's God given *****  \nBut conscious that himself * was part  \n\np. 470  \n\nOf Vishnu, he was firm in heart.  \n\nThe Wind-God's son the fight beheld,  \nAnd rushed at Ravan, rage-impelled.  \nDown crashed his mighty hand the foe  \nFull in the chest received the blow.  \nHis eyes grew dim, his knees gave way,  \nAnd senseless on the earth he lay.  \n\nThe Wind-God's son to Rama bore  \nDeep-wounded Lakshman stained with gore.  \nHe whom no foe might lift or bend  \nWas light as air to such a friend.  \nThe dart that Lakshman's side had cleft,  \nUntouched, the hero's body left,  \nAnd flushing through the air afar  \nResumed its place in Ravan's car;  \nAnd, waxing well though wounded sore,  \nHe felt the deadly pain no more.  \nAnd Ravan, though with deep wounds pained,  \nSlowly his sense and strength regained,  \nAnd furious still and undismayed  \nOn bow and shaft his hand he laid.  \n\nThen Hanuman to Rama cried:  \n'Ascend my back, great chief, and ride  \nLike Vishnu borne on Garud's wing,  \nTo battle with the giant king.'  \nSo, burning for the dire attack,  \nRode Rama on the Vanar's back,  \nAnd with fierce accents loud and slow  \nThus gave defiance to the foe,  \nWhile his strained bowstring made a sound  \nLike thunder when it shakes the ground:  \n'Stay, Monarch of the giants, stay,  \nThe penalty of sin to pay.  \nStay! whither wilt thou fly, and how  \nEscape the death that waits thee now?'  \n\nNo word the giant king returned:  \nHis eyes with flames of fury burned.  \nHis arm was stretched, his bow was bent,  \nAnd swift his fiery shafts were sent.  \nRed torrents from the Vanar flowed:  \nThen Rama near to Ravan strode,  \nAnd with keen darts that never failed,  \nThe chariot of the king assailed.  \nWith surest aim his arrows flew:  \nThe driver and the steeds he slew.  \nAnd shattered with the pointed steel  \nCar, flag, and pole and yoke and wheel.  \nAs Indra hurls his bolt to smite  \nMount Meru's heaven-ascending height,  \nSo Rama with a flaming dart  \nStruck Lanka's monarch near the heart,  \nWho reeled and fell beneath the blow  \nAnd from loose fingers dropped his bow.  \nBright as the sun, with crescent head,  \nFrom Rama's bow an arrow sped,  \nAnd from his forehead, proud no more,  \nCleft the bright coronet he wore.  \n\nThen Rama stood by Ravan's side  \nAnd to the conquered giant cried:  \n'Well hast thou fought: thine arm has slain  \nStrong heroes of the Vanar train.  \nI will not strike or slay thee now,  \nFor weary, faint with fight art thou.  \nTo Lanka's town thy footsteps bend,  \nAnd there the night securely spend.  \nTo-morrow come with car and bow,  \nAnd then my prowess shall thou know.'  \n\nHe ceased: the king in humbled pride  \nRose from the earth and naught replied.  \nWith wounded limbs and shattered crown  \nHe sought again his royal town.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[468:1](ry454.htm#fr_973) 'It is to be understood,' says the commentator,\n'that this is not * the Akampan who has already been slain.*\n\n[469:1](ry454.htm#fr_974) Ravan's son, whom Hanuman killed when he first\nvisited Lanka.\n\n[469:2](ry454.htm#fr_975) Nila was the son of Agni the God of Fire and\npossessed, like Milton's demons, the power of dilating and condensing his form\nat pleasure.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LX.: Kumbhakarna Roused.](ry455.htm)\n\n"
