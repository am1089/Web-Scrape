The sages, being very\nmuch pleased at the death of Jalub, performed adoration to Buldeo Jee, and\nglorifying him greatly, offered presents. Bulram, the abode of happiness,\nafter this departed thence, and proceeded on his pilgrimage.\n\nO great king! having visited all holy places of pilgrimage, and made a circuit\nof the earth, he arrived at the country\n\np. 394\n\nabout Delhi, where Doorjodhun and Bheemsen were carrying on a great war; and\nShree Krishnu Chund and great Rajas, together with the descendants of Pandoo,\nwere standing looking on. On Bulram Jee\'s arrival, the two heroes, Doorjodhun\nand Bheemsen, made him a salutation; the one regarding him as his spiritual\npreceptor, the other as his brother. When, O great king! Buldeo Jee saw them\nfighting, he said, "Both of you are powerful, brave warriors; O resolute\nheroes! refrain now from war, preserve the progeny of Kooroo and Pandoo;\nbrothers, friends, have all been exterminated." Both said, when they heard\nthis, bowing their heads, "We cannot now give up fighting." Then Doorjodhun\nsaid, "O divine preceptor! I will not speak falsely in your presence; be\npleased to listen with careful attention to what I am about to say. This great\nwar, which is now being carried on, in which people have been killed, and will\nbe killed, is carried on by the advice of your brother, Shree Krishnu Chund\nJee. These poor helpless creatures, who are now fighting, are as much under\nthe power of Huri, as a wooden puppet is in the power of a juggler, who can\nmake it move in any direction he pleases. It was not right in him to assist\nthe Panduvus, and act with such enmity towards us; he has caused the shoulder\nof Doosasun to be torn from its socket by Bheem, and has caused me to be\nwounded in the thigh by a club. What more need I now say to you? Whatever Huri\nmay wish will now be done, this every one knows." When Doorjodhun had thus\nspoken, Bulram Jee approached Shree Krishnu Chund, having first said to\nDoorjodhun, "You, of course, have not practised any stratagem or treachery to\ncause violence?" And he said to his brother, "What have you done in causing\nthis war to be waged, and Doosasun\'s shoulder to be torn from its socket, and\nDoorjodhun\'s thigh to be wounded? This is not a custom of fair fighting, that\na powerful man should pluck out another\'s shoulder from the socket, or direct\nweapons, and aim below the loins. It is\n\np. 395\n\na fair fight when one challenges the other, and fights opposite him." Shree\nKrishnu Chund replied, "O brother! you do not know the circumstances; these\nKouruvus are very unjust and tyrannical, their tyranny is beyond description,\nthey first, at the suggestion of Doosasun, Shugoon and Bhugdunt, cheated at\nplay, and won every thing belonging to Raja Joodisthur. Doosasun laid hold of\nDropudee by the hand, and for that reason Bheemsen pulled his arm out of the\nsocket. Dhoorjodhun, in the midst of the court, told Dropudee to sit upon his\nthigh; and for this reason his thigh was wounded." Shree Krishnu Chund\nproceeded to say, "Brother! you do not know what injustice the Kouruvus have\nshown towards the Panduvus, and I cannot describe it; the fire of this war\nwill not, therefore, be now extinguished, do not attempt any remedy."\n\nWhen Krishnu, O great king! had thus spoken, Bulram Jee came from the country\nin the neighbourhood of Delhi to the city of Dwarka; and, having an interview\nwith Rajas Oogursen and Soorsen, began to say to them with joined hands, "O\ngreat kings! through your excellence and glory I have made a pilgrimage to all\nholy places; but I have been guilty of a fault." Raja Oogursen said, "What\nfault?" Bulram Jee replied, "O great king! having gone to Neemkhar, I killed\nSoot Jee, the sin of whose murder attaches to me, with your permission I will\nnow go again to Neemkhar; and, having seen the sacrifice, and bathed at the\nholy place, will obliterate the sin of the murder; after that I will give food\nto brahmins and give an entertainment to all persons of my own caste, in order\nthat I may obtain renown in the world." Raja Oogursen consented, and told him\nto proceed on his journey, and return to him.\n\nO great king! having obtained the Raja\'s leave, Bulram Jee, accompanied by\nseveral of the descendants of Judoo, went to Neemkhar; and having bathed and\noffered gifts, was purified, and returned. Afterwards, having sent for his\nfamily priest,\n\np. 396\n\nand caused burnt offerings to be offered up to the gods, he fed and\nentertained brahmins, and his own caste; and, having observed all the customs\nusual in the world, was made clean.\n\nHaving recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said, O great\nking! whoever shall hear this history with attention; all his sins shall be\nannihilated.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LXXX](psa81.htm)\n\n'
