But he; from the inferential mark supplied by their reflection.\n\nThe 'but' indicates the setting aside of the prima facie view raised. Of all\neffected things, the _Mahat_ , and so on, the highest Person himself, in so\nfar as embodied in the immediately preceding substance, is the direct cause.--\nHow is this known?--'From the inferential mark supplied by the reflection of\nthem.' By 'reflection' the Sutra means the resolve expressed in the recurring\nphrase, 'May I be many'; 'That fire thought, may I be many'; 'That water\nthought, may I be many' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 2, 3; 4). As these texts declare that\nthere was thought in the form of a resolve of self-multiplication--which\nthought can belong to a Self only, we conclude that also the Mahat, the\nahankara, the Ether, and so on, accomplish the sending forth of their\nrespective effects only after similar thought, and such thought can belong\nonly to the highest Brahman embodied in the Mahat, ahankara, and so on. That\nthe highest Brahman is embodied in all beings and constitutes their Self, is\ndirectly stated in the antaryamin-brahma _n_ a, 'He who abiding in the earth;\nabiding in water; abiding in fire,' &c. &c. (B _ri_. Up. III, 7, 3 ff.); and\nlikewise in the Subala-Up, 'Whose body is the earth,' &c. &c., up to 'Whose\nbody is the Unevolved.' The Purvapakshin had maintained that the creation,\nfrom Brahman, of breath, and so on, which is declared in texts such as 'From\nhim are born breath, mind,' &c., may be understood as a mediate creation. This\npoint is taken up by the next Sutra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 15. But the order of succession...](sbe48261.htm)\n\n"
