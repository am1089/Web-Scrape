[ _Looks up_.]\n\nAN untimely storm 1 is gathering. For see!\n\nThe peacocks gaze and lift their fans on high;  \n  The swans forget their purpose to depart;  \nThe untimely storm afflicts the blackened sky,  \n  And the wistful lover\'s heart.1\n\nAnd again:\n\nThe wet bull\'s belly wears no deeper dye;  \n  In flashing lightning\'s golden mantle clad,  \n  While cranes, his buglers, make the heaven glad,  \nThe cloud, a second Vishnu, 2 mounts the sky.2\n\nAnd yet again:\n\nAs dark as Vishnu\'s form, with circling cranes  \nTo trumpet him, instead of bugle strains,  \n  And garmented in lightning\'s silken robe,  \nApproaches now the harbinger of rains.3\n\nWhen lightning\'s lamp is lit, the silver river  \n  Impetuous falls from out the cloudy womb;  \n  Like severed lace from heaven-cloaking gloom,  \nIt gleams an instant, then is gone forever.4\n\nLike shoaling fishes, or like dolphins shy,  \nOr like to swans, toward heaven\'s vault that fly,  \n  Like paired flamingos, male and mate together,  \nLike mighty pinnacles that tower on high, p. 76  \n  In thousand forms the tumbling clouds embrace,  \n  Though torn by winds, they gather, interlace,  \nAnd paint the ample canvas of the sky.5\n\nThe sky is black as Dhritar\xc4\x81shtra\'s face;  \nProud as the champion of Kuru\'s race,  \n  The haughty peacock shrills his joy abroad;  \nThe cuckoo, in Yudhishthira\'s sad case,  \n  Is forced to wander if he would not die;  \n  The swans must leave their forest-homes and fly,  \nLike P\xc4\x81ndu\'s sons, to seek an unknown place.6\n\n[ _Reflecting_.] It is long since Maitreya went to visit Vasantasen\xc4\x81. And even\nyet he does not come.\n\n[ _Enter Maitreya_.]\n\n_Maitreya_. Confound the courtezan\'s avarice and her incivility! To think of\nher making so short a story of it! Over and over she repeats something about\nthe affection she feels, and then without more ado she pockets the necklace.\nShe is rich enough so that she might at least have said: "Good Maitreya, rest\na little. You must not go until you have had a cup to drink." Confound the\ncourtezan! I hope I\'ll never set eyes on her again. [ _Wearily_.] The proverb\nis right. " It is hard to find a lotus-plant without a root, a merchant who\nnever cheats, a goldsmith who never steals, a village-gathering without a\nfight, and a courtezan without avarice." Well, I\'ll find my friend and\npersuade him to have nothing more to do with this courtezan. [ _He walks about\nuntil he discovers Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_.] Ah, my good friend is sitting in the\norchard. I\'ll go to him. [ _Approaching_.] Heaven bless you! May happiness be\nyours.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Looking up_.] Ah, my friend Maitreya has returned. You are\nvery welcome, my friend. Pray be seated.\n\n_Maitreya_. Thank you.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Tell me of your errand, my friend.\n\n_Maitreya_. My errand went all wrong.\n\np. 77\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. What! did she not accept the necklace?\n\n_Maitreya_. How could we expect such a piece of luck? She put her lotus-tender\nhands to her brow, 1 and took it.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Then why do you say "went wrong"?\n\n_Maitreya_. Why not, when we lost a necklace that was the pride of the four\nseas for a cheap golden casket, that was stolen before we had a bite or a\ndrink out of it?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Not so, my friend.\n\nShe showed her trust in leaving us her treasure;  \nThe price of confidence has no less measure.7\n\n_Maitreya_. Now look here! I have a second grievance. She tipped her friend\nthe wink, covered her face with the hem of her dress, and laughed at me. And\nso, Brahman though I am, I hereby fall on my face before you and beg you not\nto have anything more to do with this courtezan. That sort of society does any\namount of damage. A courtezan is like a pebble in your shoe. It hurts before\nyou get rid of it. And one thing more, my friend. A courtezan, an elephant, a\nscribe, a mendicant friar, a swindler, and an ass\xc2\x97where these dwell, not even\nrogues are born.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Oh, my friend, a truce to all your detraction! My poverty of\nitself prevents me. For consider:\n\nThe horse would gladly hasten here and there,  \n  But his legs fail him, for his breath departs.  \nSo men\'s vain wishes wander everywhere,  \n  Then, weary grown, return into their hearts.8\n\nThen too, my friend:\n\nIf wealth is thine, the maid is thine,  \n  For maids are won by gold;\n\n[ _Aside_. And not by virtue cold. _Aloud_.]\n\nBut wealth is now no longer mine,  \n  And her I may not hold.9\n\np. 78\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Looks down. Aside_.] From the way he looks up and sighs, I\nconclude that my effort to distract him has simply increased his longing. The\nproverb is right. "You can\'t reason with a lover." [ _Aloud_.] Well, she told\nme to tell you that she would have to come here this evening. I suppose she\nisn\'t satisfied with the necklace and is coming to look for something else.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Let her come, my friend. She shall not depart unsatisfied.\n\n[ _Enter Kumbh \xc4\xablaka_.]\n\n_Kumbh \xc4\xablaka_. Listen, good people.\n\nThe more it rains in sheets,  \n  The more my skin gets wet;  \nThe more the cold wind beats,  \n  The more I shake and fret.10\n\n[ _He bursts out laughing_.]\n\nI make the sweet flute speak from seven holes,  \n  I make the loud lute speak on seven strings;  \nIn singing, I essay the donkey\'s roles:  \n  No god can match my music when he sings.11\n\nMy mistress Vasantasen\xc4\x81 said to me "Kumbh\xc4\xablaka, go and tell Ch\xc4\x81rudatta that I\nam coming." So here I am, on my way to Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\'s house. [ _He walks about,\nand, as he enters, discovers Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_.] Here is Ch\xc4\x81rudatta in the orchard.\nAnd here is that wretched jackanapes, too. Well, I\'ll go up to them. What! the\norchard-gate is shut? Good! I\'ll give this jackanapes a hint. [ _He throws\nlumps of mud_.]\n\n_Maitreya_. Well! Who is this pelting me with mud, as if I were an apple-tree\ninside of a fence?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Doubtless the pigeons that play on the roof of the garden-\nhouse.\n\n_Maitreya_. Wait a minute, you confounded pigeon! With this stick I\'ll bring\nyou down from the roof to the ground, like an over-ripe mango. [ _He raises\nhis stick and starts to run_.]\n\np. 79\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Holding him back by the sacred cord_.] Sit down, my friend.\nWhat do you mean? Leave the poor pigeon alone with his mate.\n\n_Kumbh \xc4\xablaka_. What! he sees the pigeon and doesn\'t see me? Good! I\'ll hit him\nagain with another lump of mud. [ _He does so_.]\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Looks about him_.] What! Kumbh\xc4\xablaka? I\'ll be with you in a\nminute. [ _He approaches and opens the gate_.] Well, Kumbh\xc4\xablaka, come in. I\'m\nglad to see you.\n\n_Kumbh \xc4\xablaka_. [ _Enters_.] I salute you, sir.\n\n_Maitreya_. Where do you come from, man, in this rain and darkness?\n\n_Kumbh \xc4\xablaka_. You see, she\'s here.\n\n_Maitreya_. Who\'s she? Who\'s here?\n\n_Kumbh \xc4\xablaka_. She. See? She.\n\n_Maitreya_. Look here, you son of a slave! What makes you sigh like a half-\nstarved old beggar in a famine, with your "shesheshe"?\n\n_Kumbh \xc4\xablaka_. And what makes you hoot like an owl with your "whowhowho"?\n\n_Maitreya_. All right. Tell me.\n\n_Kumbh \xc4\xablaka_. [ _Aside_.] Suppose I say it this way. [ _Aloud_.] I\'ll give\nyou a riddle, man.\n\n_Maitreya_. And I\'ll give you the answer with my foot on your bald spot.\n\n_Kumbh \xc4\xablaka_. Not till you\'ve guessed it. In what season do the mango-trees\nblossom?\n\n_Maitreya_. In summer, you jackass.\n\n_Kumbh \xc4\xablaka_. [ _Laughing_.] Wrong!\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Aside_.] What shall I say now? [ _Reflecting_.] Good! I\'ll go\nand ask Ch\xc4\x81rudatta. [ _Aloud_.] Just wait a moment. [ _Approaching Ch\n\xc4\x81rudatta_.] My friend, I just wanted to ask you in what season the mango-trees\nblossom.\n\np. 80\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. You fool, in spring, in _vasanta_.\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Returns to Kumbh \xc4\xablaka_.] You fool, in spring, in _vasanta_.\n\n_Kumbh \xc4\xablaka_. Now I\'ll give you another. Who guards thriving villages?\n\n_Maitreya_. Why, the guard.\n\n_Kumbh \xc4\xablaka_. [ _Laughing_.] Wrong!\n\n_Maitreya_. Well, I\'m stuck. [ _Reflecting_.] Good! I\'ll ask Ch\xc4\x81rudatta again.\n[ _He returns and puts the question to Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_.]\n\nCh\xc4\x81rudatta. The army, my friend, the _sen \xc4\x81_.\n\nMaitreya. [ _Comes back to Kumbh \xc4\xablaka_.] The army, you jackass, the _sen \xc4\x81_.\n\n_Kumbh \xc4\xablaka_. Now put the two together and say \xc2\x91em fast.\n\n_Maitreya_. Sen\xc4\x81-vasanta.\n\n_Kumbh \xc4\xablaka_. Say it turned around.\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Turns around_.] Sen\xc4\x81-vasanta.\n\n_Kumbh \xc4\xablaka_. You fool! you jackanapes! Turn the parts of the thing around!\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Turns his feet around_.] Sen\xc4\x81-vasanta.\n\n_Kumbh \xc4\xablaka_. You fool! Turn the parts of the word around!\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _After reflection_.] Vasanta-sen\xc4\x81.\n\n_Kumbh \xc4\xablaka_. She\'s here.\n\n_Maitreya_. Then I must tell Ch\xc4\x81rudatta. [ _Approaching_.] Well, Ch\xc4\x81rudatta,\nyour creditor is here.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. How should a creditor come into my family?\n\n_Maitreya_. Not in the family perhaps, but at the door. Vasantasen\xc4\x81 is here.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Why do you deceive me, my friend?\n\n_Maitreya_. If you can\'t trust me, then ask Kumbh\xc4\xablaka here. Kumbh\xc4\xablaka, you\njackass, come here.\n\np. 81\n\n_Kumbh \xc4\xablaka_. [ _Approaching_.] I salute you, sir.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. You are welcome, my good fellow. Tell me, is Vasantasen\xc4\x81 really\nhere?\n\n_Kumbh \xc4\xablaka_. Yes, she\'s here. Vasantasen\xc4\x81 is here.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Joyfully_.] My good fellow, I have never let the bearer of\nwelcome news go unrewarded. Take this as your recompense. [ _He gives him his\nmantle_.]\n\n_Kumbh \xc4\xablaka_. [ _Takes it and bows. Gleefully_.] I\'ll tell my mistress.\n\n[ _Exit_.\n\n_Maitreya_. Do you see why she comes in a storm like this?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. I do not quite understand, my friend.\n\n_Maitreya_. I know. She has an idea that the pearl necklace is cheap, and the\ngolden casket expensive. She isn\'t satisfied, and she has come to look for\nsomething more.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Aside_.] She shall not depart unsatisfied.\n\n[ _Then enter the love-lorn Vasantasen \xc4\x81, in a splendid garment, fit for a\nwoman who goes to meet her lover, a maid with an umbrella, and the courtier_.]\n\n_Courtier_. [ _Referring to Vasantasen \xc4\x81_.]\n\nLakshm\xc4\xab 1 without the lotus-flower is she,  \n  Loveliest arrow of god K\xc4\x81ma\'s bow, 2  \nThe sweetest blossom on love\'s magic tree.\n\nSee how she moves, so gracefully and slow!  \n  In passion\'s hour she still loves modesty;  \nIn her, good wives their dearest sorrow know.\n\nWhen passion\'s drama shall enacted be,  \n  When on love\'s stage appears the passing show,  \n  A host of wanderers shall bend them low,  \nGlad to be slaves in such captivity.12\n\np. 82\n\nSee, Vasantasen\xc4\x81, see!\n\nThe clouds hang drooping to the mountain peaks,  \nLike a maiden\'s heart, that distant lover seeks:  \nThe peacocks startle, when the thunder booms,  \nAnd fan the heaven with all their jeweled plumes.13\n\nAnd again:\n\nMud-stained, and pelted by the streaming rain,  \nTo drink the falling drops the frogs are fain;  \nFull-throated peacocks love\'s shrill passion show,  \nAnd n\xc4\xabpa flowers like brilliant candles glow;  \nUnfaithful clouds obscure the hostage moon,  \nLike knaves, unworthy of so dear a boon;  \nLike some poor maid of better breeding bare,  \nThe impatient lightning rests not anywhere.14\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. 1 Sir, what you say is most true. For\n\nThe night, an angry rival, bars my way;  \nHer thunders fain would check and hinder me:  \n"Fond fool! with him I love thou shalt not stay,  \n\xc2\x92Tis I, \xc2\x92tis I, he loves," she seems to say,  \n"Nor from my swelling bosom shall he flee."15\n\n_Courtier_. Yes, yes. That is right. Scold the night.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. And yet, sir, why scold one who is so ignorant of woman\'s\nnature? For you must remember:\n\nThe clouds may rain, may thunder ne\xc2\x92er so bold,  \n  May flash the lightning from the sky above;  \nThat woman little reeks of heat or cold,  \n  Who journeys to her love.16\n\n_Courtier_. But see, Vasantasen\xc4\x81! Another cloud,\n\nSped by the fickle fury of the air  \n  A flood of arrows in his rushing streams,  \nHis drum, the roaring thunder\'s mighty blare,  \n  His banner, living lightning\'s awful gleams\xc2\x97p. 83\n\nRages within the sky, and shows him bold  \n  \xc2\x92Mid beams that to the moon allegiance owe,  \nLike a hero-king within the hostile hold  \n  Of his unwarlike foe.17\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. True, true. And more than this:\n\nAs dark as elephants, these clouds alone  \n  Fall like a cruel dart\xc2\x97  \nWith streaks of lightning and with white birds strewn\xc2\x97  \n  To wound my wretched heart.  \nBut, oh, why should the heron, bird of doom,  \n  With that perfidious sound 1  \nOf "Rain! Rain! Rain!"\xc2\x97grim summons to the tomb  \n  For her who spends her lonely hours in gloom\xc2\x97  \nStrew salt upon the wound?18\n\n_Courtier_. Very true, Vasantasen\xc4\x81. And yet again:\n\nIt seems as if the sky would take the guise  \n  Of some fierce elephant to service bred;  \nThe lightning like a waving streamer flies,  \n  And white cranes serve to deck his mighty head.19\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. But look, sir, look!\n\nClouds, black as wet tam\xc4\x81la-leaves, the ball  \n  Of heaven hide from our sight;  \nRain-smitten homes of ants decay and fall  \n  Like beasts that arrows smite;  \nLike golden lamps within a lordly hall  \n  Wander the lightnings bright;  \nAs when men steal the wife of some base thrall,  \nClouds rob the moon of light.20\n\n_Courtier_. See, Vasantasen\xc4\x81, see!\n\nClouds, harnessed in the lightning\'s gleams,  \n  Like charging elephants dash by; p. 84  \nAt Indra\'s bidding, pour their streams,  \nUntil with silver cords it seems  \n  That earth is linked with sky.21\n\nAnd look yonder!\n\nAs herds of buffaloes the clouds are black;  \n  The winds deny them ease;  \nThey fly on lightning wings and little lack  \n  Of seeming troubled seas.\n\nSmitten with falling drops, the fragrant sod,  \nUpon whose bosom greenest grasses nod,  \nSeems pierced with pearls, each pearl an arrowy rod.22\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. And here is yet another cloud.\n\nThe peacock\'s shrill-voiced cry  \nImplores it to draw nigh;  \nAnd ardent cranes on high  \nEmbrace it lovingly.\n\nThe wistful swans espy  \nThe lotus-sweeter sky;  \nThe darkest colors lie  \nOn heaven clingingly.23\n\n_Courtier_. True. For see!\n\nA thousand lotuses that bloom by night,  \nA thousand blooming when the day is bright,  \nNor close nor ope their eyes to heaven\'s sight;  \n  There is no night nor day.\n\nThe face of heaven, thus shrouded in the night,  \nIs only for a single instant bright,  \nWhen momentary lightning gives us sight;  \n  Else is it dark alway.\n\nNow sleeps the world as still as in the night  \nWithin the house of rain where naught is bright, p. 85  \nWhere hosts of swollen clouds seem to our sight  \n  One covering veil of gray.24\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. True. And see!\n\nThe stars are lost like mercies given  \n  To men of evil heart;  \nLike lonely-parted wives, the heaven  \n  Sees all her charms depart.  \nAnd, molten in the cruel heat  \n  Of Indra\'s bolt, it seems  \nAs if the sky fell at our feet  \n  In liquid, flowing streams.25\n\nAnd yet again:\n\nThe clouds first darkly rise, then darkly fall,  \nSend forth their floods of rain, and thunder all;  \nAssuming postures strange and manifold,  \nLike men but newly blest with wealth untold.26\n\n_Courtier_. True.\n\nThe heaven is radiant with the lightning\'s glare;  \n  Its laughter is the cry of myriad cranes;  \nIts voice, the bolts that whistle through the air;  \n  Its dance, that bow whose arrows are the rains.  \nIt staggers at the winds, and seems to smoke  \nWith clouds, which form its black and snaky cloak.27\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. O shameless, shameless sky!\n\n      To thunder thus, while I  \n      To him I love draw nigh.  \nWhy do thy thunders frighten me and pain?  \nWhy am I seized upon by hands of rain?28\n\nO Indra, mighty Indra!\n\nDid I then give thee of my love before,  \nThat now thy clouds like mighty lions roar?  \nAh no! Thou shouldst not send thy streaming rain,  \nTo fill my journey to my love with pain.29\n\np. 86\n\nRemember:\n\nFor Ahaly\xc4\x81\'s sweet sake thou once didst lie;  \n  Thou knowest lover\'s pain.  \nAs thou didst suffer then, now suffer I;  \n  O cruel, cease thy rain.30\n\nAnd yet:\n\nThunder and rain and lighten hundredfold  \n  Forth from thy sky above;  \nThe woman canst thou not delay nor hold  \n  Who journeys to her love.31\n\nLet thunders roar, for men were cruel ever;  \nBut oh, thou maiden lightning! didst thou never  \nKnow pains that maidens know?32\n\n_Courtier_. But mistress, do not scold the lightning. She is your friend,\n\nThis golden cord that trembles on the breast  \nOf great Air\xc4\x81vata; 1 upon the crest  \n  Of rocky hills this banner all ablaze;  \nThis lamp in Indra\'s palace; but most blest  \n  As telling where your most beloved stays.33\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. And here, sir, is his house.\n\n_Courtier_. You know all the arts, and need no instruction now. Yet love bids\nme prattle. When you enter here, you must not show yourself too angry.\n\nWhere anger is, there love is not;  \nOr no! except for anger hot,  \n  There is no love.\n\nBe angry! make him angry then!  \nBe kind! and make him kind again  \n  The man you love.34\n\nSo much for that. Who is there? Let Ch\xc4\x81rudatta know, that\n\np. 87\n\nWhile clouds look beautiful, and in the hour  \nFragrant with n\xc4\xabpa and kadamba flower,  \nShe comes to see her lover, very wet,  \nWith dripping locks, but pleased and loving yet.  \nThough lightning and though thunder terrifies,  \nShe comes to see you; \xc2\x92tis for you she sighs.  \nThe mud still soils the anklets on her feet,  \nBut in a moment she will have them sweet.35\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Listening_.] My friend, pray discover what this means.\n\n_Maitreya_. Yes, sir. [ _He approaches Vasantasen \xc4\x81. Respectfully_.] Heaven\nbless you!\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. I salute you, sir. I am very glad to see you. [ _To the\ncourtier_.] Sir, the maid with the umbrella is at your service.\n\n_Courtier_. [ _Aside_.] A very clever way to get rid of me. [ _Aloud_.] Thank\nyou. And mistress Vasantasen\xc4\x81,\n\nPride and tricks and lies and fraud  \n  Are in your face;  \nFalse playground of the lustful god,  \n  Such is your face;  \nThe wench\'s stock in trade, in fine,  \n  Epitome of joys divine,  \nI mean, your face  \n  For sale! the price is courtesy.  \nI trust you\'ll find a man to buy  \n  Your face.36\n\n[ _Exit_.]\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Good Maitreya, where is your gambler?\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Aside_.] "Gambler"? Ah, she\'s paying a compliment to my friend.\n[ _Aloud_.] Madam, here he is in the dry orchard.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. But sir, what do you call a dry orchard?\n\n_Maitreya_. Madam, it\'s a place where there\'s nothing to eat or drink. [\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81 smiles_.] Pray enter, madam.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _Aside to her maid_.] What shall I say when I enter?\n\np. 88\n\n_Maid_. "Gambler, what luck this evening?"\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Shall I dare to say it?\n\n_Maid_. When the time comes, it will say itself.\n\n_Maitreya_. Enter, madam.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _Enters, approaches Ch \xc4\x81rudatta, and strikes him with the\nflowers which she holds_.] Well, gambler, what luck this evening?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Discovers her_.] Ah, Vasantasen\xc4\x81 is here. [ _He rises\njoyfully_.] Oh, my beloved,\n\nMy evenings pass in watching ever,  \n  My nights from sighs are never free;  \nThis evening cannot else than sever  \n  In bringing you\xc2\x97my grief and me.37\n\nYou are very, very welcome. Here is a seat. Pray be seated.\n\n_Maitreya_. Here is a seat. Be seated, madam. [ _Vasantasen \xc4\x81 sits, then the\nothers_.]\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. But see, my friend,\n\nThe dripping flower that decks her ear, droops down,  \n               And one sweet breast  \nAnointed is, like a prince who wears the crown,  \n               With ointment blest.38\n\nMy friend, Vasantasen\xc4\x81\'s garments are wet. Let other, and most beautiful,\ngarments be brought.\n\n_Maitreya_. Yes, sir.\n\n_Maid_. Good Maitreya, do you stay here. I will wait upon my mistress. [ _She\ndoes so_.]\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Aside to Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_.] My friend, I\'d just like to ask the\nlady a question.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Then do so.\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Aloud_.] Madam, what made you come here, when it is so stormy\nand dark that you can\'t see the moon?\n\n_Maid_. Mistress, the Brahman is very plain-spoken.\n\np. 89\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. You might better call him clever.\n\n_Maid_. My mistress came to ask how much that pearl necklace is worth.\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Aside to Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_.] There! I told you so. She thinks the\npearl necklace is cheap, and the golden casket is expensive. She isn\'t\nsatisfied. She has come to look for something more. Maid. For my mistress\nimagined that it was her own, and gambled it away. And nobody knows where the\ngambling-master has gone, for he is employed in the king\'s business.\n\n_Maitreya_. Madam, you are simply repeating what somebody said before.\n\n_Maid_. While we are looking for him, pray take this golden casket. [ _She\ndisplays the casket. Maitreya hesitates_.] Sir, you examine it very closely.\nDid you ever see it before?\n\n_Maitreya_. No, madam, but the skilful workmanship captivates the eye.\n\n_Maid_. Your eyes deceive you, sir. This is the golden casket.\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Joyfully_.] Well, my friend, here is the golden casket, the\nvery one that thieves stole from our house.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. My friend,\n\nThe artifice we tried before,  \nHer stolen treasure to restore,  \nIs practised now on us. But no,  \nI cannot think \xc2\x92tis really so.39\n\n_Maitreya_. But it is so. I swear it on my Brahmanhood.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. This is welcome news.\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Aside to Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_.] I\'m going to ask where they found it.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. I see no harm in that.\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Whispers in the maid\'s ear_.] There!\n\n_Maid_. [ _Whispers in Maitreya\'s ear_.] So there!\n\np. 90\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. What is it? and why are we left out?\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Whispers in Ch \xc4\x81rudatta\'s ear_.] So there!\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. My good girl, is this really the same golden casket?\n\n_Maid_. Yes, sir, the very same.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. My good girl, I have never let the bearer of welcome news go\nunrewarded. Take this ring as your recompense. [ _He looks at his finger,\nnotices that the ring is gone, and betrays his embarrassment_.]\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _To herself_.] I love you for that.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Aside to Maitreya_.] Alas,\n\nWhen in this world a man has lost his all,  \n  Why should he set his heart on longer life?  \nHis angers and his favors fruitless fall,  \n  His purposes and powers are all at strife.40\n\nLike wingless birds, dry pools, or withered trees,  \nLike fangless snakes\xc2\x97the poor are like to these.41\n\nLike man-deserted houses, blasted trees,  \nLike empty wells\xc2\x97the poor are like to these.  \nFor them no pleasant hours serve happy ends;  \nThey are forgotten of their sometime friends.42\n\n_Maitreya_. But you must not grieve thus beyond reason. [ _He bursts out\nlaughing. Aloud_.] Madam, please give me back my bath-clout.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, it was not right that you should show your\ndistrust of me by sending me this pearl necklace.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _With an embarrassed smile_.] But remember, Vasantasen\xc4\x81,\n\nWho will believe the truth?  \n  Suspicion now is sure.  \nThis world will show no ruth  \n  To the inglorious poor.43\n\np. 91\n\n_Maitreya_. Tell me, girl, are you going to sleep here to-night?\n\n_Maid_. [ _Laughing_.] But good Maitreya, you show yourself most remarkably\nplain-spoken now.\n\n_Maitreya_. See, my friend, the rain enters again in great streams, as if it\nwanted to drive people away when they are sitting comfortably together.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. You are quite right.\n\nThe falling waters pierce the cloud,  \n  As lotus-shoots the soil;  \nAnd tears the face of heaven shroud,  \n  Who weeps the moon\'s vain toil.44\n\nAnd again:\n\nIn streams as pure as thoughts to good men given,  \n  But merciless as darts that Arjun hurls,  \nAnd black as Baladeva\'s cloak, the heaven  \n  Seems to pour out all Indra\'s hoarded pearls.45\n\nSee, my beloved, see!\n\nThe heaven is painted with the blackest dye,  \n  And fanned by cool and fragrant evening airs;  \nRed lightning, glad in union, clasps the sky  \nWith voluntary arms, and shows on high  \n  The love that maiden heart to lover bears.46\n\n[ _Vasantasen \xc4\x81 betrays her passion, and throws her arms about Ch\xc4\x81rudatta.\nCh\xc4\x81rudatta feels her touch, and embraces her_.]\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. More grimly yet, O thunder, boom;\n\n  For by thy grace and power  \nMy love-distracted limbs now bloom  \n  Like the kadamba flower.  \n  Her dear touch all my being thrills,  \nAnd love my inmost spirit fills.47\n\n_Maitreya_. Confound you, storm! You are no gentleman, to frighten the lady\nwith the lightning.\n\np. 92\n\nCh\xc4\x81rudatta. Do not rebuke the storm, my friend.\n\nLet ceaseless rain a hundred years endure,  \n  The lightning quiver, and the thunder peal;  \nFor what I deemed impossible is sure:  \n  Her dear-loved arms about my neck I feel.48\n\nAnd oh, my friend,\n\nHe only knows what riches are,  \nWhose love comes to him from afar,  \nWhose arms that dearest form enfold,  \nWhile yet with rain \xc2\x92tis wet and cold.49\n\nVasantasen\xc4\x81, my beloved,\n\nThe masonry is shaken; and so old  \nThe awning, that \xc2\x92twill not much longer hold.  \nHeavy with water is the painted wall,  \nFrom which dissolving bits of mortar fall.50\n\n[ _He looks up_.] The rainbow! See, my beloved, see!\n\nSee how they yawn, the cloudy jaws of heaven,  \nAs by a tongue, by forked lightning riven;  \n  And to the sky great Indra\'s fiery bow  \nIn lieu of high-uplifted arms is given.51\n\nCome, let us seek a shelter. [ _He rises and walks about_.]\n\nOn palm-trees shrill,  \nOn thickets still,  \nOn boulders dashing,  \nOn waters splashing,  \nLike a lute that, smitten, sings,  \nThe rainy music rings.52\n\n[ _Exeunt omnes_.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[75:1](lcc11.htm#fr_59) In Indian love-poetry, the rainy season is the time\nwhen lovers most ardently long to be united.\n\n[75:2](lcc11.htm#fr_60) In allusion to Vishnu\'s name, Krishna, "black."\n\n[77:1](lcc11.htm#fr_61) A gesture of respect.\n\n[81:1](lcc11.htm#fr_62) The goddess of wealth and beauty, usually represented\nwith a lotus.\n\n[81:2](lcc11.htm#fr_63) K\xc4\x81ma\'s (Cupid\'s) arrows are flowers.\n\n[82:1](lcc11.htm#fr_64) Throughout this scene, Vasantasen\xc4\x81\'s verses are in\nSanskrit.
