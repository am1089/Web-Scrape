Verily, his fiery spirit, his energy, or vital power, depart from\nhim whom Soma purges either upwards or downwards.\n\n12:7:2:22\\. As to this they say, 'Truly, the Soma-juice is the Brahma _n_ a's\nfood; and, indeed, it is not owing to Soma when a Brahma _n_ a vomits Soma;\nand he who vomits Soma is one who, whilst being fit to (gain) prosperity, does\nnot gain prosperity, and who, whilst being fit to (gain) cattle, does not gain\ncattle 1, for Soma is cattle.'\n\n12:7:2:33\\. Let him seize for sacrifice that grey (he-goat) of the A _s_ vins,\nthe ram of Sarasvati, and the bull of Indra; for the A _s_ vins are the\nphysicians of the gods, and it is by them that he heals this (Sacrificer); and\nSarasvati is healing medicine, and it is with her help that he prepares\nmedicine for him; and Indra is energy (indriya), or vital power, and it is\nwith his help that he bestows energy, or vital power, on this (Sacrificer).\n\n12:7:2:44\\. The two A _s_ vins, indeed, are the eyesight,\n\np. 218\n\nfiery spirit; and inasmuch as there is (a victim) sacred to the A _s_ vins, he\n(the priest) bestows eyesight, fiery spirit, on this (Sacrificer). And the ear\nalso (he thereby bestows on him), for one and the same are the eye and the\near.\n\n12:7:2:55\\. Sarasvati is the breath, vital power; and inasmuch as there is (a\nvictim) sacred to Sarasvati, he bestows breath, vital power, on this\n(Sacrificer). And the off-breathing also (he thereby bestows on him), for one\nand the same are the breath (of the mouth) and the of breathing.\n\n12:7:2:66\\. Indra is speech, strength; and inasmuch as there is (a victim)\nsacred to Indra, he bestows speech, strength, on this (Sacrificer); and mind\nalso, for one and the same are speech and mind.\n\n12:7:2:77\\. 'He-goats are sacred to the A _s_ vins, ewes to Sarasvati, and\ncows (and bulls) to Indra,' they say: if these animals are sacrificed, he, by\nmeans of those deities, gains those (three) animals.\n\n12:7:2:88\\. There is a mare with a foal 1: the one-hoofed (animal),glory, he\nthereby secures (for the Sacrificer 2). There are hairs of wild beasts 3, for\nthe purpose of securing the wild beasts;--there are hairs of wolf: vigour, the\nimpetuous rush of wild beasts, he thereby secures;--there are hairs of tiger:\ncourage, the sway of wild beasts, he thereby secures;--there are hairs\n\np. 219\n\nof lion: might, the rule of wild beasts, he thereby secures.\n\n12:7:2:99\\. There are grains of rice and grains of millet, grains of wheat and\nkuvala jujubes, Indra-grain and badara jujubes, grains of barley and karkandhu\njujubes, malted rice and barley 1: both cultivated and wild-grain food he\nthereby secures; and by means of both kinds of food he duly lays energy and\nvital power into his own self.\n\n12:7:2:1010\\. With lead he buys 2 the malted rice, with (sheep's) wool the\nmalted barley, with thread the (fried) rice-grain,--that lead is a form of\nboth iron and gold, and the Sautrama _n_ i is both an ish _t_ i-offering and\nan animal sacrifice, so that he thereby secures both of these.\n\n12:7:2:1111\\. With wool and thread 3 he buys,--this, to wit, wool and thread,\nis women's work; and work, indeed, means energy, or vital power, and this\nlatter is extinct in women: he thus secures (for the Sacrificer) that energy,\nor vital power, which is extinct in women.\n\n12:7:2:1212\\. Here now, other Adhvaryus buy the malted rice with lead from a\neunuch, saying, 'That is that 4; for the eunuch is neither woman nor man, and\nthe\n\np. 220\n\n[paragraph continues] Sautrama _n_ i is neither an ish _t_ i-offering nor an\nanimal sacrifice.' But let him not do so, for the Sautrama _n_ i is both an\nish _t_ i and an animal sacrifice, and the eunuch is something unsuccessful\namong men: they who do this thus place failure into the very mouth (opening)\nof the sacrifice. Let him rather buy them from a vendor of Soma, for the\nSautrama _n_ i is Soma: he thus puts a form of Soma into the very mouth of the\nsacrifice so as to secure the sacrifice.\n\n12:7:2:1313\\. There is a pot (kumbhi) perforated with a hundred holes 1, for\nin many ways did that (Soma) flow out of (Indra); and a hundred-sized also,\nindeed, is the sacrifice: it is the sacrifice he thereby secures. There is a\nbowl (rata 2): it is the real (or good) thing (sat) he thereby secures. There\nis a dish ( _k_ apya) for him to secure food. There is a filter, for they\ncleanse him, (the Sacrificer, by this offering). There is a tail (-whisk) for\nturning away evil. There is gold for him to secure form (or colour); it weighs\na hundred (grains), for man has a life of a hundred (years) and a hundred\nenergies: life, and energy, vital power, he thus lays into his own self.\n\n12:7:2:1414\\. There is an a _s_ vattha (ficus religiosa) vessel: honour he\nthereby secures. There is an udumbara (ficus glomerata) one: force he thereby\nsecures. There is a nyagrodha (ficus indica) one: sweet drink he thereby\nsecures. There are (earthen) pots (sthali): the food of the earth he thereby\nsecures.\n\n12:7:2:1515\\. There are supernumerary 3 (vessels) of pala _s_ a\n\np. 221\n\nwood: the pala _s_ a (butea frondosa) is the Brahman (holy writ, holiness, the\npriesthood): it is by the Brahman that he gains the heavenly world. There are\ntwo feathers of a talon-slaying (bird) 1: courage, the sway of birds, he\nthereby secures. There are thirty-six of these (objects), for the B _ri_ hati\nconsists of thirty-six syllables, and cattle are related to the B _ri_ hati:\nby means of the B _ri_ hati he thus secures cattle for him.\n\n12:7:2:1616\\. As to this they say, 'The victims have one set of deities, and\nthe cakes another set of deities: this is an improper performance 2; how does\nit become right and proper?' To Indra belongs the last of the victims, and to\nIndra the first of the cakes; and Indra, indeed, is energy (indriya), or vital\npower: through (Indra's) energy he thus confers on him energy, or vital power;\nand through (Indra's) energy he secures energy, or vital power.\n\n12:7:2:1717\\. There is a cake to Savit _ri_ for him to become impelled by\nSavit _ri_ ; and one to Varu _n_ a, for it is Varu _n_ a that seizes him who\nis seized by evil: through Varu _n_ a he thus delivers him from Varu _n_ a's\npower;--it is the final (cake): he thus delivers him finally from Varu _n_ a's\nnoose.\n\n12:7:2:1818\\. Indra's (cake) is one on eleven potsherds, in order that he may\nsecure (Indra's) energy, or vital\n\np. 222\n\npower; for the Trish _t_ ubh consists of eleven syllables, and the Trish _t_\nubh is energy, or vital power.\n\n12:7:2:1919\\. Savit _ri_ 's (cake) is one on twelve potsherds, for there are\ntwelve months in the year, and the year means constantly existing food: from\nthe year he thus secures for hire food.\n\n12:7:2:2020\\. Varu _n_ a's (cake) is one on ten potsherds, for the Vira _g_\nconsists of ten syllables, and Varu _n_ a is Vira _g_ (the widely ruling), the\nlord of food: through Varu _n_ a he thus secures food for him. In the middle\n(of the sacrifice) they proceed with (the offering of) these cakes, for the\ncentre means their (mother's) womb: he thus causes them to be produced from\ntheir own (mother's) womb.\n\n12:7:2:2121\\. A mare with a foal is the sacrificial fee, for such a (mare)\nproduces both the horse and the mule, and the Sautrama _n_ i is both an ish\n_t_ i-offering and an animal sacrifice: thus it is so in order that he may\nsecure both of these.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[217:1](sbe44066.htm#fr_571) According to Katy. XIX, 1, 4, the Sautrama _n_ i\nmay also be performed by one who finds himself in the unfortunate position\nhere referred to; as also (acc. to ib. 3) by a king who has been deprived of\nhis kingdom.\n\n[218:1](sbe44066.htm#fr_572) According to [XII, 9, 2,\n11](sbe44072.htm#12:9:2:11), a milch cow with her calf are given as dakshi _n_\na for the two paps offered to Aditi, whilst a mare and foal, according to\n[XII, 7, 2, 21](sbe44066.htm#12:7:2:21), are the fee for the offering of the\nthree victims; though Katyayana, it is true, makes no mention of this dakshi\n_n_ a.\n\n[218:2](sbe44066.htm#fr_573) Or, perhaps, he (the Sacrificer) secures for\nhimself; but see [paragraph 15](sbe44066.htm#12:7:2:15), 'asmai avarunddhe.'\n\n[218:3](sbe44066.htm#fr_574) Hairs of a wolf, tiger, and lion are put into the\ncups of spirituous liquor from which libations are made.\n\n[219:1](sbe44066.htm#fr_575) That is, rice and barley grain that has\ngerminated, and subsequently become dry.\n\n[219:2](sbe44066.htm#fr_576) As on the occasion of the purchase of Soma-plants\n(part ii, p. 63 seq.), the bargain is effected near the anta _h_ patya-peg at\nthe back of the Vedi, where an ox-hide is spread for the purpose; the Adhvaryu\nasking the seller, 'Seller of Sura and Soma, hast thou Sura and Soma for\nsale?'\n\n[219:3](sbe44066.htm#fr_577) Thus 'ur _n_ a-sutram' is to be resolved,\naccording to Katy. XIX, 1, 18; the wool being used for buying malted barley,\nand the thread for buying fried rice.\n\n[219:4](sbe44066.htm#fr_578) That is, one is the same as the other.\n\n[220:1](sbe44066.htm#fr_579) For the use of this pot, see note on [XII, 8, 1,\n8](sbe44068.htm#12:8:1:8).\n\n[220:2](sbe44066.htm#fr_580) See [XII, 8, 3, 14](sbe44070.htm#12:8:3:14).\n[15](sbe44070.htm#12:8:3:14).\n\n[220:3](sbe44066.htm#fr_581) At III, 7, 2, 1. 2, I would also now translate\n'upa _s_ aya' by 'supernumerary' or 'additional':--there are eleven stakes,\nand a twelfth, rough-hewn, supernumerary one, &c.\n\n[221:1](sbe44066.htm#fr_582) For the use of the two feathers of an eagle, see\n[XII, 7, 3, 22](sbe44067.htm#12:7:3:22).\n\n[221:2](sbe44066.htm#fr_583) The rule (as laid down in III, 8, 3, 1) is that\nthe Pa _s_ u-puro _d_ a _s_ a, or animal cakes, offered after the animal\nportions, should belong to the same deities to whom the victims are sacred. On\nthe present occasion this is, however, not the case; for while the three\nsacrificial animals of the main performance belong to the A _s_ vins, to\nSarasvati and Indra, the three cakes are offered to Indra, Savit _ri_ , and\nVaru _n_ a respectively.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XII, 7, 3.
