Now for the greatness of the chariot of Vata\n[1](sbe3262.htm#an_10:168:1:1)! Its roar goes crashing and thundering. It\nmoves touching the sky, and creating red sheens\n[2](sbe3262.htm#an_10:168:1:2), or it goes scattering the dust of the earth.\n\n2\\. Afterwards there rise the gusts of Vata [1](sbe3262.htm#an_10:168:2:1),\nthey go towards him, like women to a feast [2](sbe3262.htm#an_10:168:2:2). The\ngod goes with them on the same chariot, he, the king of the whole of this\nworld.\n\n3\\. When he moves on his paths along the sky, he rests not even a single day\n[1](sbe3262.htm#an_10:168:3:1); the friend of the waters, the first-born, the\nholy, where was he born, whence did he spring?\n\n4\\. The breath of the gods, the germ [1](sbe3262.htm#an_10:168:4:1) of the\nworld, that god moves wherever he listeth; his roars indeed are heard, not his\nform--let us offer sacrifice to that Vata!\n\np. 450\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nAscribed to Anila Vatayana, and addressed to Vayu, here called Vata.
