The young mother carries in secret the boy confined\n[1](sbe46106.htm#an_5:2:1:1); she does not yield him to the father. People do\nnot see before them his fading [2](sbe46106.htm#an_5:2:1:2) face laid down\nwith the Arati [3](sbe46106.htm#an_5:2:1:3).\n\n2\\. Who is that boy, O young woman, whom thou, the Peshi\n[1](sbe46106.htm#an_5:2:2:1), carriest? It is the queen who has borne him.\nThrough many autumns the fruit of the womb has increased. I saw him born when\nhis mother gave birth to him.\n\n3\\. I saw him the gold-toothed, brilliant-coloured preparing his weapons far\nfrom his dwelling-place [1](sbe46106.htm#an_5:2:3:1). After I have offered to\nhim the ambrosia cleared (from all impure mixture)\n[2](sbe46106.htm#an_5:2:3:2)--what may the Indra-less, the hymnless do to me?\n\n4\\. I saw him, the highly shining (Agni), walking far from his dwelling-place,\nlike (a bull) together with the herd [1](sbe46106.htm#an_5:2:4:1). Those\n(women) have not held him, for he has been born. The young women become grey\n[2](sbe46106.htm#an_5:2:4:2).\n\n5\\. Who have separated my young bull from the cows that\n[1](sbe46106.htm#an_5:2:5:1) had no cow-herd, not even a stranger? May those\nwho have held him, let him loose. May he, the knowing one, lead the cattle\ntowards us.\n\n6\\. Him, the king of dwellings (?) [1](sbe46106.htm#an_5:2:6:1), the dwelling-\nplace of people, the Aratis have laid down [2](sbe46106.htm#an_5:2:6:2) among\nmen. May the spells of Atri loose him. May the reproachers become reproachable\n(themselves).\n\n7\\. Thou hast loosed the bound _S_ una _h_ _s_ epa from\n\np. 367\n\nthe thousand sacrificial posts; for he toiled (worshipping thee). Thus, O\nAgni, loose from us the fetters, O knowing Hot _ri_ , sitting down here.\n\n8 [1](sbe46106.htm#an_5:2:8:1). For thou hast gone away\n[2](sbe46106.htm#an_5:2:8:2) from me, because thou wert angry; (this) the\nprotector of the laws of the gods [3](sbe46106.htm#an_5:2:8:3) has told me.\n(But) Indra, the knowing one, has looked after thee. Instructed by him, O\nAgni, I have come hither.\n\n9\\. Agni shines with mighty light; he makes all things visible by his\ngreatness. He conquers godless, wicked wiles. He sharpens his two horns in\norder to pierce the Rakshas.\n\n10\\. And may the roarings of Agni mount up to the sky, with sharp weapons in\norder to kill the Rakshas. In his rapture his flames break down (everything);\nthe godless hindrances do not hold him back.\n\n11\\. This song of praise, O strong-born (Agni), I, the priest, have fashioned\nfor thee, as a skilful workman (builds) a chariot\n[1](sbe46106.htm#an_5:2:11:1). If thou acceptest that (praise), O god Agni,\nmay we conquer thereby waters together with the sun.\n\n12\\. May the bull [1](sbe46106.htm#an_5:2:12:1) with mighty neck, grown\nstrong, with no foe to resist him, get together the niggard's wealth. Thus the\nimmortal (gods) have spoken to this Agni: may he grant protection to the man\nwho has spread the Barhis; may he grant protection to the man who brings\nofferings.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe _Ri_ shi of verses I, 3-8, 10-12, is Kumara \xc3\x82treya, or V _ri_ _s_ a _G_\nana; or both are the _Ri_ shis of these verses. Of the verses 2 and 9 V _ri_\n_s_ a alone is the _Ri_ shi. The metre is\n\np. 368\n\n[paragraph continues] Trish _t_ ubh (verse 12, _S_ akvari).--Verse 9 = AV.\nVIII, 3, 24. Verses 9, 10 = TS. I, 2, 14, 7. Verse 11 = TB. II, 4, 7, 4.\n\nA part of this hymn is very obscure. I do not think, as does Prof. Geldner\n(Festgruss an Roth, 192), that the story of the _S_ a _t_ yayanakam (see Saya\n_n_ a's commentary, and compare Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ avi _m_ _s_ a Brahma _n_ a XIII 3,\n12), of the Purohita V _ri_ _s_ a, who drives with the king on the royal\nchariot and kills a boy, throws any real light on the difficult points of the\nhymn. Nor does it seem to me that, as is the opinion of Prof. Hillebrandt\n(Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlandischen Gesellschaft, XXXIII, 248 seq.),\nthe first six verses, which Hillebrandt considers as an independent hymn,\ncontain a description of how the fire which they try to produce by the\nattrition of the Ara _n_ is, does not appear. In my opinion the hymn--which is\nreally one hymn as the tradition gives it--is a prayer of a person who\nsuffers, who feels himself bound by the fetters of distress (verse 7) and\npersecuted by the power of Rakshas (verses 9, 10). Agni, formerly resplendent,\nhas decayed and has forsaken him: may Agni be restored to his former might\n(verse 6), and may we ourselves be released from all distress (verse 7, &c.).\nPossibly the hymn is connected with the rite of Punaradheya, where the\nsacrificial fire which has brought no luck to the sacrificer, is extinguished,\nand after an interval a new fire is established (H. O., Religion des Veda, p.\n353). There may of course be other special points, beyond the reach of our\nconjectures, which, if known, would elucidate several of the obscure allusions\nso frequent in the first verses of the hymn.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. The boy very probably is Agni.--With the words samubdham guha\nbibharti, cf. I, 158, 5. susamubdham ava-adhu _h_.\n\nNote 2. Not without hesitation I translate minat as if it were the middle\nminanam. Possibly the word means: 'which violates (the ordinances),' i. e.\nwhich does not shine and bring luck to men as it usually does. Na seems, as it\n\np. 369\n\nusually does (cf. Delbruck, Altindische Syntax, p. 543), to belong to the\nwhole clause, and not to mina.\n\nNote 3. Bohtlingk-Roth and Grassmann conjecture aratnau; Hillebrandt, aratau;\nGeldner (Festgruss an Roth, 192), aratau. Geldner seems to be right (cf. verse\n6), though it will scarcely be possible to determine what concrete being was\nhere thought of. Geldner says, 'Gemeint ist die Pi _s_ a _k_ ika, welche die\nGluth des Feuers entfuhrt hat;' but, as has already been observed, I do not\nthink that this traditional story on the meaning of our hymn is of any real\nvalue.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. The meaning of Peshi is unknown. The word seems anyhow to describe the\nwrong mother as low or contemptible. Agni is degraded by sojourning with her,\nwhile his proper nature is glorious, for he is the queen's son.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Agni has forsaken his proper dwelling.\n\nNote 2. On vip _r i_kvat, cf. Taitt. Sa _m_ hita III, 1, 6, 2. yuna _g_ mi\ntisra _h_ vip _r i_ _k_ a _h_ su\xc2\xb4ryasya te; Va _g_. Sa _m_ hita IX, 4. samp _r\ni_ _k_ au stha _h_ sam ma bhadrena p _ri_ \xe1\xb9\x85ktam; vip _r i_ _k_ au stha _h_ vi\nma papmana p _ri_ \xe1\xb9\x85ktam. Vi-p _ri_ _k_ seems to mean, consequently, 'to free\nsomething from an admixture,' and am _r i_tam vip _r i_kvat seems to be\nambrosia in which dwells the power of getting free from bad admixtures. Thus\nin the passage quoted from the Taitt. Sa _m_ hita the Sun is referred to as\nthrice cleared from all impure elements. It is quite uncertain whether the\nexpression used here refers or not to the myth of the churning of the ocean\n(Geldner, loc. cit.), and I do not think that we should translate am _r i_tam\nvip _r i_kvat, as Geldner does, 'das was sich als Nektar ausscheidet.'\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. I read with Bohtlingk-Roth sumadyutham.\n\nNote 2. The young women seem to be hostile beings of\n\np. 370\n\nthe same kind as the young woman mentioned in verse 2. They try to seize Agni,\nbut he has been born already; his fiery, unassailable nature has been formed.\nI do not pretend to know what it means that then those female foes become grey\nwith age. 'I think they are the Dawns who hold Agni in the dark; but when he\nescapes and is actually born, they, the Dawns, become grey.' M. M.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. The relative pronoun yesham seems to refer both to the bull (maryakam)\nand to the cows (gobhi _h_ ). The bull probably is Agni who has been separated\nfrom the cows, i. e. the oblations, prayers, &c. (?) 'Possibly the bull Agni,\nthe rising sun, has been separated from the cows, the clouds or dawns.' M. M.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Vasa\xc2\xb4m ra\xc2\xb4 _g_ anam. I cannot follow the interpretation of Pischel,\nVedische Studien, I, 210.\n\nNote 2. Or ni dadu _h_ , 'they have bound him'? Cf. ava s _ri_ _g_ antu in the\nthird Pada, and niditam in verse 7.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. The whole verse is nearly identical with X, 32, 6.\n\nNote 2. I consider aiye _h_ (cf. Bartholomae, Arische Forschungen, II, 72, 76;\nStudien zur Indogermanischen Sprachgeschichte, I, 21) as 2nd sing. pluperfect\nof the root i.\n\nNote 3. Varu _n_ a?\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. With the second Pada compare I, 130, 6; V, 29, 15.\n\n##### Verse 12.\n\nNote 1. The bull of course is Agni.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 3](sbe46107.htm)\n\n"
