At departing; there being nothing to be reached. For thus others (also\ndeclare).\n\nThe further question arises whether the putting off of all good and evil deeds\ntakes place only at the time when the soul leaves the body, or also after it\nhas departed and is on its journey to the world of Brahman. The Purvapakshin\nholds the latter view, for, he says, the texts declare both. The Kaushitakins\nsay that the soul shakes off its good and evil deeds when it crosses the river\nVira _g_ a in the world of Brahman; while the Ta _n_ dins say 'Shaking off all\nevil, and shaking off the body,' &c., which shows that the deeds are shaken\noff at the time when the soul leaves the body. And when the _S_ a _t_ yayanaka\nsays that 'his sons obtain his inheritance, his friends his good deeds,' and\nso on, this also intimates that the deeds are shaken off at the time when the\nsoul leaves the body. We therefore must conclude that a part of the deeds is\nleft behind at the moment of death, and the remainder on the journey to the\nworld of Brahman.--This view the Sutra controverts. All the good and evil\ndeeds of the dying man are left behind, without remainder, at the time when\nthe soul parts from the body. For after the soul of him who knows has departed\nfrom the body, 'there is nothing to be reached,' i.e. there are no further\npleasures and pains to be enjoyed as the result of good and evil deeds,\ndifferent from the obtaining of Brahman, which is the fruit of knowledge. Thus\nothers 'also declare that, subsequently to the soul's departure from the body,\nthere is no enjoyment of any pain or pleasure different from the obtaining of\nBrahman. 'But when he is free of the body, then neither pleasure nor pain\n\np. 649\n\ntouches him'; 'Thus does that serene being, rising from this body, appear in\nits own form as soon as it has approached the highest light' ( _Kh._ Up. VIII,\n12, 1; 3); 'For him there is delay only so long as he is not freed (from the\nbody); then he will be perfect' (VI, 14, 2).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 28.
