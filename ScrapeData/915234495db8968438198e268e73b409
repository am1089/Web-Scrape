Their discovery\nenabled Professor Max Muller, forty-seven years ago, to dispose finally of the\nBrahmanical legend according to which Hindu society was supposed to be\ngoverned by the codes of ancient sages, compiled for the express purpose of\ntying down each individual to his station, and of strictly regulating even the\nsmallest acts of his daily life 1. It enabled\n\np. x\n\nhim not only to arrive at this negative result, but also to substitute a\nsounder theory the truth of which subsequent investigations have further\nconfirmed, and to show that the sacred law of the Hindus has its source in the\nteaching of the Vedic schools, and that the so-called revealed law codes are,\nin most cases, but improved metrical editions of older\n\np. xi\n\nprose works which latter, in the first instance, were destined to be committed\nto memory by the young Aryan students, and to teach them their duties. This\ncircumstance, as well as the fact that \xc3\x82pastamba\'s work is free from any\nsuspicion of having been tampered with by sectarians or modern editors, and\nthat its intimate connection with the manuals teaching the performance of the\ngreat and small sacrifices, the _S_ rauta and G _ri_ hya-sutras, which are\nattributed to the same author, is perfectly clear and indisputable, entitle\nit, in spite of its comparatively late origin, to the first place in a\ncollection of Dharma-sutras.\n\nThe \xc3\x82pastambiya Dharma-sutra forms part of an enormous Kalpa-sutra or body of\naphorisms, which digests the teaching of the Veda and of the ancient _Ri_ shis\nregarding the performance of sacrifices and the duties of twice-born men,\nBrahma _n_ as, Kshatriyas, and Vai _s_ yas, and which, being chiefly based on\nthe second of the four Vedas, the Ya _g_ ur-veda in the Taittiriya recension,\nis primarily intended for the benefit of the Adhvaryu priests in whose\nfamilies the study of the Ya _g_ ur-veda is hereditary.\n\nThe entire Kalpa-sutra of \xc3\x82pastamba is divided into\n\np. xii\n\nthirty sections, called Pra _s_ nas, literally questions 1. The first twenty-\nfour of these teach the performance of the so-called _S_ rauta or Vaitanika\nsacrifices, for which several sacred fires are required, beginning with the\nsimplest rites, the new and full moon offerings, and ending with the\ncomplicated Sattras or sacrificial sessions, which last a whole year or even\nlonger 2. The twenty-fifth Pra _s_ na contains the Paribhashas or general\nrules of interpretation 3, which are valid for the whole Kalpa-sutra, the\nPravara-kha _n_ _d_ a, the chapter enumerating the patriarchs of the various\nBrahmanical tribes, and finally the Hautraka, prayers to be recited by the\nHotraka priests. The twenty-sixth section gives the Mantras or Vedic prayers\nand formulas for the G _ri_ hya rites, the ceremonies for which the sacred\ndomestic or G _ri_ hya fire is required, and the twenty-seventh the rules for\nthe performance of the latter 4. The aphorisms on the sacred law fill the next\ntwo Pra _s_ nas; and the _S_ ulva-sutra 5, teaching the geometrical\nprinciples, according to which the altars necessary for the _S_ rauta\nsacrifices must be constructed, concludes the work with the thirtieth Pra _s_\nna.\n\nThe position of the Dharma-sutra in the middle of the collection at once\nraises the presumption that it originally formed an integral portion of the\nbody of Sutras and that it is not a later addition. Had it been added later,\nit would either stand at the end of the thirty Pra _s_ nas or altogether\noutside the collection, as is the case with some other treatises attributed to\n\xc3\x82pastamba 6. The Hindus are, no doubt, unscrupulous in adding to the works of\nfamous teachers. But such additions, if of considerable extent, are usually\nnot embodied in the works themselves which they are intended to supplement.\nThey are mostly given\n\np. xiii\n\nas _s_ eshas or parisi _s_ h _t_ as, tacked on at the end, and generally\nmarked as such in the MSS.\n\nIn the case of the \xc3\x82pastamba Dharma-sutra it is, however, not necessary to\nrely on its position alone, in order to ascertain its genuineness. There are\nunmistakable indications that it is the work of the same author who wrote the\nremainder of the Kalpa-sutra. One important argument in favour of this view is\nfurnished by the fact that Pra _s_ na XXVII, the section on the G _ri_ hya\nceremonies has evidently been made very short and concise with the intention\nof saving matter for the subsequent sections on the sacred law. The\n\xc3\x82pastambiya G _ri_ hya-sutra contains nothing beyond a bare outline of the\ndomestic ceremonies, while most of the other G _ri_ hya-sutras, e.g. those of\n\xc3\x82 _s_ valayana, _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana, Gobhila, and Paraskara, include a great many\nrules which bear indirectly only on the performance of the offerings in the\nsacred domestic fire. Thus on the occasion of the description of the\ninitiation of Aryan students, \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana inserts directions regarding the\ndress and girdle to be worn, the length of the studentship, the manner of\nbegging, the disposal of the alms collected, and other similar questions 1.\nThe exclusion of such incidental remarks on subjects that are not immediately\nconnected with the chief aim of the work, is almost complete in \xc3\x82pastamba\'s G\n_ri_ hya-sutra, and reduces its size to less than one half of the extent of\nthe shorter ones among the works enumerated above. It seems impossible to\nexplain this restriction of the scope of Pra _s_ na XXVII otherwise than by\nassuming that \xc3\x82pastamba wished to reserve all rules bearing rather on the\nduties of men than on the performance of the domestic offerings, for his\nsections on the sacred law.\n\nA second and no less important argument for the unity of the whole Kalpa-sutra\nmay be drawn from the cross-references which occur in several Pra _s_ nas. In\nthe Dharma-sutra we find that on various occasions, where the performance\n\np. xiv\n\nof a ceremony is prescribed, the expressions yathoktam, \'as has been stated,\'\nyathopade _s_ am, \'according to the injunction,\' or yatha purastat, \'as\nabove,\' are added. In four of these passages, Dh. I, 1, 4, 16; II, 2, 3, 17;\n2, 5, 4; and 7, 17, 16, the G _ri_ hya-sutra is doubtlessly referred to, and\nthe commentator Haradatta has pointed out this fact. On the other hand, the G\n_ri_ hya-Sutra refers to the Dharma-sutra, employing the same expressions\nwhich have been quoted from the latter. Thus we read in the beginning of the\nchapter on funeral oblations, G _ri_ hya-sutra VIII, 21, 1, masi _s_\nraddhasyaparapakshe yathopade _s_ a _m_ kala _h_ , \'the times for the monthly\nfuneral sacrifice (fall) in the latter (dark) half of the month according to\nthe injunction.\' Now as neither the G _ri_ hya-sutra itself nor any preceding\nportion of the Kalpa-sutra contains any injunction on this point, it, follows\nthat the long passage on this subject which occurs in the Dharma-sutra II, 7,\n16, 4-22 is referred to. The expression yathopade _s_ am is also found in\nother passages of the G _ri_ hya-sutra, and must be explained there in a like\nmanner 1. There are further a certain number of Sutras which occur in the same\nwords both in the Pra _s_ na on domestic rites, and in that on the sacred law,\ne.g. Dh. I, 1, A; I, 1, 2, 38; I, 1, 4, 14. It seems that the author wished to\ncall special attention to these rules by repeating them. Their recurrence and\nliteral agreement may be considered an additional proof of the intimate\nconnection of the two sections.\n\nThrough a similar repetition of, at least, one Sutra it is possible to trace\nthe connection of the Dharma-sutra with the _S_ rauta-sutra. The rule _ri_ tve\nva _g_ ayam, \'or (he may have conjugal intercourse) with his wife in the\nproper season\', is given, Dh. II, 2, 5, 17, with reference to a householder\nwho teaches the Veda. In the _S_ rauta-sutra it occurs twice, in the sections\non the new and full moon sacrifices III, 17, 8, and again in connection with\nthe _K_ aturmasya offerings, VIII, 4, 6, and it refers both times\n\np. xv\n\nto the sacrificer. In the first passage the verb, upeyat, is added, which the\nsense requires; in the second it has the abbreviated form, which the best MSS.\nof the Dharma-sutra offer. The occurrence of the irregular word, ritve for\n_ri_ tvye, in all the three passages, proves clearly that we have to deal with\na self-quotation of the same author. If the Dharma-sutra were the production\nof a different person and a later addition, the Pseudo-\xc3\x82pastamba would most\nprobably not have hit on this peculiar irregular form. Finally, the G _ri_\nhya-sutra, too, contains several cross-references to the _S_ rauta-sutra, and\nthe close agreement of the Sutras on the Vedic sacrifices, on the domestic\nrites, and on the sacred, both in language and style, conclusively prove that\nthey are the compositions of one author 1.\n\nWho this author really was, is a problem which cannot be solved for the\npresent, and which probably will. always remain unsolved, because we know his\nfamily name only. For the form of the word itself shows that the name\n\xc3\x82pastamba, just like those of most founders of Vedic schools, e.g. Bharadva\n_g_ a, \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana, Gautama, is a patronymic. This circumstance is, of\ncourse, fatal to all attempts at an identification of the individual who holds\nso prominent a place among the teachers of the Black Ya _g_ ur-veda.\n\nBut we are placed in a somewhat better position with respect to the history of\nthe school which has been named after \xc3\x82pastamba and of the works ascribed to\nhim. Regarding both, some information has been preserved by tradition, and a\nlittle more can be obtained from inscriptions and later works, while some\ninteresting details regarding the time when, and the place where the Sutras\nwere composed, may be elicited from the latter themselves. The data,\nobtainable from these sources, it is true, do not enable us to determine with\ncertainty the year when the \xc3\x82pastambiya school was founded, and when its\nSutras were composed. But they make it possible to ascertain the position of\nthe school and of its Sutras in Vedic literature,\n\np. xvi\n\ntheir relative priority or posteriority as compared with other Vedic schools\nand works, to show with some amount of probability in which part of India they\nhad their origin, and to venture, at least, a not altogether unsupported\nconjecture as to their probable antiquity.\n\nAs regards the first point, the _K_ ara _n_ avyuha, a supplement of the White\nYa _g_ ur-veda which gives the lists of the Vedic schools, informs us that the\n\xc3\x82pastambiya school formed one of the five branches of the Kha _n_ _d_ ikiya\nschool, which in its turn was a subdivision of the Taittiriyas, one of the\nancient sections of Brahma _n_ as who study, the Black Ya _g_ ur-veda. Owing\nto the very unsatisfactory condition of the text of the _K_ ara _n_ avyuha it\nis unfortunately not possible to ascertain what place that work really assigns\nto the \xc3\x82pastambiyas among the five branches of the, Kha _n_ _d_ ikiyas. Some\nMSS. name them first, and others, last. They give either the following list,\n1. Kaleyas (Kaletas), 2. Sa _t_ yavanins, 3. Hira _n_ yake _s_ ins, 4.\nBharadva _g_ ins, and 5. \xc3\x82pastambins, or, 1. \xc3\x82pastambins, 2. Baudhayanins or\nBodhayanins, 3. Satyasha _dh_ ins, 4. Hira _n_ yake _s_ ins, 5. Aukheyas 1.\nBut this defect is remedied to, a certain extent by the now generally current,\nand probably ancient tradition that the \xc3\x82pastambiyas are younger than, the\nschool of Baudhayana, and. older than that of Satyasha _dh_ a Hira _n_ yake\n_s_ in. Baudhayana, it is alleged, composed the first set of Sutras connected\nwith the Black Ya _g_ ur-Veda, which bore the special title \'prava _k_ ana,\'\nand he was succeeded by Bharadva _g_ a, \xc3\x82pastamba, and Satyasha _dh_ a Hira\n_n_ yake _s_ in, who all founded schools which bear their names 2.\n\np. xvii\n\nThis tradition has preserved two important pieces of in-formation. First, the\n\xc3\x82pastamba school is what Professor Max Muller appropriately calls a Sutra _k_\nara _n_ a, i.e. a school whose founder did not pretend to have received a\nrevelation of Vedic Mantras or of a Brahma _n_ a text, but merely gave a new\nsystematic arrangement of the precepts regarding sacrifices and the sacred\nlaw. Secondly, the Sutras of \xc3\x82pastamba occupy an intermediate position between\nthe works of Baudhayana and Hira _n_ yake _s_ in. Both these statements are\nperfectly true, and capable of being supported by proofs, drawn from\n\xc3\x82pastamba\'s own and from other works.\n\nAs regards the first point, Professor Max Muller has already pointed 1 out\nthat, though we sometimes find a Brahma _n_ a of the \xc3\x82pastambiyas mentioned,\nthe title \xc3\x82pastamba-brahma _n_ a is nothing but another name of the\nTaittiriya-brahma _n_ a, and that this Brahma _n_ a, in reality, is always\nattributed to Tittiri or to the pupils of Vai _s_ ampayana, who are said to\nhave picked up the Black Ya _g_ ur-veda in the shape of partridges (tittiri).\nThe same remark applies to the collection of the Mantras of the Black Ya _g_\nur-veda, which, likewise, is sometimes named \xc3\x82pastamba-Sa _m_ hita. The _K_\nara _n_ avyuha states explicitly that the five branches of the Kha _n_ _d_\nikiya school, to which the \xc3\x82pastambiyas belong, possess one and the same\nrecension of the revealed texts, consisting of 7 Ka _n_ _d_ as, 44 Pra _s_\nnas, 651 Anuvakas, 2198 Pannasis, 19290 Padas 2, and 253,868 syllables, and\nindicates thereby that all these five schools were Sutra _k_ ara _n_ as.\n\nIf we now turn to \xc3\x82pastamba\'s own works, we find still\n\np. xviii\n\nclearer proof that he laid no claim to the title _Ri_ shi, or inspired seer of\nVedic texts. For (Dharma-sutra I, 2, 5, 4-5 says distinctly that on account of\nthe prevalent transgression of the rules of studentship no _Ri_ shis are born,\namong the Avaras, the men of later ages or of modern times, but that some, by\nvirtue of a residue of the merit which they acquired in former lives, become\nsimilar to _Ri_ shis by their knowledge of the Veda. A man who speaks in this\nmanner, shows that he considers the holy ages during which the great saints\nsaw with their mind\'s eye the uncreated and eternal texts of the Veda to be\npast, and that all he claims is a thorough acquaintance with the scriptures\nwhich had been handed down to him. The same spirit which dictated this passage\nis also observable in other portions of the Dharma-sutra. For \xc3\x82pastamba\nrepeatedly contrasts the weakness and sinfulness of the Avaras, the men of his\nown times, with the holiness of the ancient sages, who, owing to the greatness\nof their \'lustre,\' were able to commit various forbidden acts without\ndiminishing their spiritual merit 1. These utterances prove that \xc3\x82pastamba\nconsidered himself a child of the Kali Yuga, the age of sin, during which,\naccording to Hindu notions, no _Ri_ shis can be born. If, therefore, in spite\nof this explicit disclaimer, the Sa _m_ hita and the Brahma _n_ a of the Black\nYa _g_ ur-veda are sometimes called \xc3\x82pastamba or \xc3\x82pastambiya, i.e. belonging\nto \xc3\x82pastamba, the meaning of this expression can only be, that they were and\nare studied and handed down by the school of \xc3\x82pastamba, not that its founder\nwas their author, or, as the Hindus would say, saw them.\n\nThe fact that \xc3\x82pastamba confined his activity to the composition of Sutras is\nhighly important for the determination of the period to which he belonged. It\nclearly shows that in his time the tertiary or Sutra period of the Ya _g_ ur-\nveda had begun. Whether we assume, with Professor Max Muller, that the Sutra\nperiod was one and the same for all the four Vedas, and fix its limits with\nhim\n\np. xix\n\nbetween 600-200 B.C., or whether we believe, as I am inclined to do, that the\ndate of the Sutra period differed for each Veda, still the incontestable\nconclusion is that the origin of the \xc3\x82pastambiya school cannot be placed in\nthe early times of the Vedic period, and probably falls in the last six or\nseven centuries before the beginning of the Christian era.\n\nThe correctness of the traditional statement that \xc3\x82pastamba is younger than\nBaudhayana may be made very probable by the following considerations. First,\nBaudhayana\'s and \xc3\x82pastamba\'s works on Dharma have a considerable number of\nSutras in common. Thus in the chapter on Penances not less than seven\nconsecutive Sutras, prescribing the manner in which outcasts are to live and\nto obtain readmission into the Brahmanical community for their children, occur\nin both treatises 1. Besides this passage, there are a number of single Sutras\n2 which agree literally. Taken by itself this agreement does not prove much,\nas it may be explained in various ways. It may show either that Baudhayana is\nolder than \xc3\x82pastamba, and that the latter borrowed from the former, or that\nthe reverse was the case. It may also indicate that both authors drew from one\ncommon source. But if it is taken together with two other facts, it gains a\nconsiderable importance. First, \xc3\x82pastamba holds in several cases doctrines\nwhich are of a later origin than those held by Baudhayana. With respect to\nthis point the puritan opinions which \xc3\x82pastamba puts forward regarding the\nsubstitutes for legitimate sons and regarding the appointment of widows\n(niyoga), and his restriction of the number of marriage-rites, may be adduced\nas examples. Like many other ancient teachers, Baudhayana permits childless\n\xc3\x82ryans to satisfy their craving for representatives bearing their name, and to\nallay their fears of falling after death into the regions of torment through a\nfailure of the funeral oblations, by the affiliation\n\np. xx\n\nof-eleven kinds of substitutes for a legitimate son. Illegitimate sons, the\nillegitimate sons of wives, the legitimate -and illegitimate offspring of\ndaughters, and the children of relatives, or even of strangers who may be\nsolemnly adopted, or received as members of the family without any ceremony,\nor be acquired by purchase, are all allowed to take the place and the rights\nof legitimate sons 1. \xc3\x82pastamba declares his dissent from this doctrine. He\nallows legitimate sons alone to inherit their father\'s estate and to follow\nthe occupations of his caste, and he explicitly forbids the sale and gift of\nchildren 2.\n\nIn like manner he protests against the custom of making over childless widows\nto brothers-in-law or other near relatives in order to obtain sons who are to\noffer the funeral oblations to the deceased husband\'s manes, while Baudhayana\nhas as yet no scruple on the subject 3. Finally, he omits from his list of the\nmarriage-rites the Pai _s_ a _k_ a vivaha, where the bride is obtained by\nfraud 4; though it is reluctantly admitted by Baudhayana and other ancient\nteachers. There can be no doubt that the law which placed the regular\ncontinuance of the funeral oblations above all other considerations, and which\nallowed, in order to secure this object, even a violation of the sanctity of\nthe marriage-tie and other breaches of the principles of morality, belongs to\nan older order of ideas than the stricter views of \xc3\x82pastamba. It is true that,\naccording to Baudhayana\'s own statement 5, before his time an ancient sage\nnamed Aupa _g_ a\xe1\xb9\x85ghani, who is also mentioned in the _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_\na, had opposed the old practice of taking substitute\'s for a legitimate son.\nIt is also very probable that for a long time the opinions of the Brahma _n_ a\nteachers, who lived in different parts of India and belonged to different\nschools, may have been divided on this subject. Still it seems very improbable\nthat of two authors who both belong to the same Veda and to the same school,\nthe\n\np. xxi\n\nearlier one should hold the later doctrine, and the later one the earlier\nopinion. The contrary appears the more probable assumption. The same remarks\napply to the cases of the Niyoga and of the Pai _s_ a _k_ a marriage 1.\n\nThe second fact, which bears on the question how the identity of so many\nSutras in the two Dharma-sutras is to be explained, affords a still stronger\nproof of \xc3\x82pastamba\'s posteriority to Baudhayana. For on several occasions, it\nappears, \xc3\x82pastamba controverts opinions which Baudhayana holds, or which may\nbe defended with the help of the latter\'s Sutras. The clearest case of this\nkind occurs in the chapter on Inheritance, where the treatment of the eldest\nson on the division of the estate by the father is discussed. There \xc3\x82pastamba\ngives it as his own opinion that the father should make an equal division of\nhis property \'after having gladdened the eldest son by some (choice portion of\nhis) wealth,\' i.e. after making him a present which should have some value,\nbut should not be so valuable as to materially affect the equality of the\nshares 2. Further on he notices the opinions of other teachers on this\nsubject, and states that the practice advocated by some, of allowing the\neldest alone to inherit, as well as the custom prevailing in some countries,\nof allotting to the eldest all the father\'s gold, or the black cows, or the\nblack iron and grain, is not in accordance with the precepts of the Vedas. In\norder to prove the latter assertion he quotes a passage of the Taittiriya Sa\n_m_ hita, in which it is declared that \'Manu divided his wealth among his\nsons,\' and no difference in the treatment of the eldest son is prescribed. He\nadds that a second passage occurs in the same Veda, which declares that \'they\ndistinguish the eldest son by (a larger portion of) the heritage,\' and which\nthus apparently countenances the partiality for the first-born. But this\nsecond passage, he contends, appealing to the\n\np. xxii\n\nopinion of the Mima _m_ sists, is, like many similar ones, merely a statement\nof a fact which has not the authority of an injunction 1. If we now turn to\nBaudhayana, we find that he allows of three different methods for the\ndistribution of the paternal estate. According to him, either an equal share\nmay be given to each son, or the eldest may receive the best part of the\nwealth, or, also, a preferential share of one tenth of the whole property. He\nfurther alleges that the cows, horses, goats, and sheep respectively go to the\neldest sons of Brahma _n_ as, Kshatriyas, Vai _s_ yas and _S_ udras. As\nauthority for the equal division he gives the first of the two Vedic passages\nquoted above; and for the doctrine that the eldest is to receive the best part\nof the estate, he quotes the second passage which \xc3\x82pastamba considers to be\nwithout the force of an injunction 2. The fact that the two authors\' opinions\nclash is manifest, and the manner in which \xc3\x82pastamba tries to show that the\nsecond Vedic passage possesses no authority, clearly indicates that before his\ntime it had been held to contain an injunction. As no other author of a\nDharma-sutra but Baudhayana is known to have quoted it, the conclusion is that\n\xc3\x82pastamba\'s remarks are directed against him. If \xc3\x82pastamba does not mention\nBaudhayana by name, the reason probably is that in olden times, just as in the\npresent day, the Brahmanical etiquette forbad a direct opposition against\ndoctrines propounded by an older teacher who belongs to the same spiritual\nfamily (vidyava _m_ sa) as oneself.\n\nA similar case occurs in the chapter on Studentship 3 where \xc3\x82pastamba, again\nappealing to the Mima _m_ sists, combats the doctrine that pupils may eat\nforbidden food, such as honey, meat, and pungent condiments, if it is given to\nthem as leavings by their teacher. Baudhayana gives no explicit rule on this\npoint, but the wording of his Sutras is not opposed to the doctrine and\npractice, to which \xc3\x82pastamba objects. Baudhayana says that students\n\np. xxiii\n\nshall avoid honey, meat, pungent condiments, &c.; he further enjoins that\npupils are to obey their teachers except when ordered to commit crimes which\ncause loss of caste (pataniya); and he finally directs them to eat the\nfragments of food given to them by their teachers. As the eating of honey and\nother forbidden substances is not a crime causing loss of caste, it is\npossible that Baudhayana himself may have considered it the duty of a pupil to\neat any kind of food given by the teacher, even honey and meat. At all events\nthe practice and doctrine which \xc3\x82pastamba blames, may have been defended by\nthe wording of Baudhayana\'s rules 1.\n\nThe three points which have been just discussed, viz. the identity of a number\nof Sutras in the works of the two authors, the fact that \xc3\x82pastamba advocates\non some points more refined or puritan opinions, and, especially, that he\nlabours to controvert doctrines contained in Baudhayana\'s Sutras, give a\npowerful support to the traditional statement that he is younger than that\nteacher. It is, however, difficult to say how great the distance between the\ntwo really is. Mahadeva, as stated above, places between them only Bharadva\n_g_ a, the author of a set of Sutras, which as yet have not been completely\nrecovered. But it seems to me not likely that the latter was his immediate\npredecessor in the vidyava _m_ sa or spiritual family to which both belonged.\nFor it cannot be expected that two successive heads of the school should each\nhave composed a Sutra and thus founded a new branch-school. It is\n\np. xxiv\n\nmore probable that Baudhayana and Bharadva _g_ a, as well as the latter and\n\xc3\x82pastamba, were separated by several intervening generations of teachers, who\ncontented themselves with explaining the works of their predecessors. The\ndistance in years between the first and the last of the three Sutrakaras must,\ntherefore, I think, be measured rather by centuries than by decades 1.\n\nAs regards the priority of \xc3\x82pastamba to the school of Satyasha _dh_ a Hira _n_\nyake _s_ in, there can be no doubt about the correctness of this statement.\nFor either Hira _n_ yake _s_ in himself, or, at least, his immediate\nsuccessors have appropriated \xc3\x82pastamba\'s Dharma-sutra and have inserted it\nwith slight modifications in their own collection. The alterations consist\nchiefly in some not very important additions, and in the substitution of more\nintelligible and more modern expressions for difficult and antiquated words 2.\nBut they do not extend so far as to make the language of the Dharma-sutra\nfully agree with that of the other sections of the collection, especially with\nthe G _ri_ hya-sutra. Numerous discrepancies between these two parts are\nobservable. Thus we read in the Hira _n_ yake _s_ i\n\np. xxv\n\n[paragraph continues] G _ri_ hya-sutra that a Brahma _n_ a must, ordinarily,\nbe initiated in his seventh year, while the rule of the Dharma-sutra, which is\nidentical with \xc3\x82p. Dh. I, 1, 1, 18, prescribes that the ceremony shall take\nplace in the eighth year after conception. The commentators, Mat _ri_ datta on\nthe G _ri_ hya-sutra and Mahadeva on the Dharma-sutra, both state that the\nrule of the G _ri_ hya-sutra refers to the seventh year after birth, and,\ntherefore, in substance agrees with the Dharma-sutra. They are no doubt right.\nBut the difference in the wording shows that the two sections do not belong to\nthe same author. The same inference may be drawn from the fact that the Hira\n_n_ yake _s_ i G _ri_ hya-sutra, which is much longer than \xc3\x82pastamba\'s,\nincludes a considerable amount of matter which refers to the sacred law, and\nwhich is repeated in the Dharma-sutra. According to a statement which I have\nheard from several learned Brahma _n_ as, the followers of Hira _n_ yake _s_\nin, when pronouncing the sa _m_ kalpa or solemn pledge to perform a ceremony,\ndeclare themselves to be members of the Hira _n_ yake _s_ i school that forms\na subdivision of \xc3\x82pastamba\'s (apastambantargatahira _n_ yake _s_ i _s_\nakhadhyayi . . . aham). But I have not been able to find these words in the\nbooks treating of the ritual of the Hira _n_ yake _s_ ins, such as the\nMahesabha _t_ _t_ i. If this assertion could be further corroborated, it would\nbe an additional strong proof of the priority of \xc3\x82pastamba, which, however,\neven without it may be accepted as a fact 1. The distance in time between the\ntwo teachers is probably not so great as that between \xc3\x82pastamba and\nBaudhayana, as Mahadeva mentions no intermediate Sutrakara between them. Still\nit is probably not less than 100, or 150 years.\n\nThe results of the above investigation which show that the origin of the\n\xc3\x82pastamba school falls in the middle of the Sutra period of the Black Ya _g_\nur-veda, and that its Sutras belong to the later, though not to the latest\nproducts of Vedic literature, are fully confirmed by an\n\np. xxvi\n\nexamination of the quotations from and references to Vedic and other books\ncontained in \xc3\x82pastamba\'s Sutras, and especially in the Dharma-sutra. We find\nthat all the four Vedas are quoted or referred to. The three old ones, the\n_Ri_ k, Ya _g_ us, and Saman, are mentioned both separately and collectively\nby the name trayi vidya, i.e. threefold sacred science, and the fourth is\ncalled not Atharva\xe1\xb9\x85girasa _h_ , as is done in most ancient Sutras, but\nAtharva-veda 1. The quotations from the _Ri_ k and Saman are not very\nnumerous. But a passage from the ninth Ma _n_ _d_ ala of the former, which is\nreferred to Dh. I, 1, 2, 2, is of some extent, and shows that the recension\nwhich \xc3\x82pastamba knew, did not differ from that which still exists. As\n\xc3\x82pastamba was an adherent of the Black Ya _g_ ur-veda, he quotes it,\nespecially in the _S_ rauta-sutra, very frequently, and he adduces not only\ntexts from the Mantra-Sa _m_ hita, but also from the Taittiriya-Brahma _n_ a\nand \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka. The most important quotations from the latter work occur Dh.\nII, 2, 3, 16-II, 2, 4, 9, where all the Mantras to be recited during the\nperformance of the Bali-offerings are enumerated. Their order agrees exactly\nwith that in which they stand in the sixty-seventh Anuvaka of the tenth Prapa\n_th_ aka of the recension of the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka which is current among the\n\xc3\x82ndhra Brahma _n_ as 2. This last point is of considerable importance, both\nfor the history of the text of that book and, as we shall see further on, for\nthe history of the \xc3\x82pastambiya school.\n\nThe White Ya _g_ ur-veda, too, is quoted frequently in the _S_ rauta-sutra and\nonce in the section on Dharma by the title Va _g_ asaneyaka, while twice its\nBrahma _n_ a, the Va _g_ asaneyi-brahma _n_ a, is cited. The longer one of the\ntwo passages, taken from the latter work, Dh. I, 4, 12, 3, does, however, not\nfully agree with the published text of the Madhyandina recension. Its wording\npossesses just sufficient resemblance to allow us to identify the passage\nwhich \xc3\x82pastamba meant, but differs from the _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a\n\np. xxvii\n\nin many details 1. The cause of these discrepancies remains doubtful for the\npresent 2. As regards the Atharva-veda, \xc3\x82pastamba gives, besides the reference\nmentioned above and a second to the \xc3\x82\xe1\xb9\x85girasa-pavitra 3, an abstract of a long\npassage from Atharva-veda XV, 10-13, regarding the treatment of a Vratya, i.e.\na learned mendicant Brahma _n_ a, who really deserves the title of an atithi,\nor guest 4. It is true that \xc3\x82pastamba, in the passage referred to, does not\nsay that his rule is based on the Atharva-veda. He merely says that a Brahma\n_n_ a is his authority. But it seems, nevertheless, certain that by the\nexpression a Brahma _n_ a, the Brahma _n_ a-like fifteenth book of the\nAtharva-veda is meant, as the sentences to be addressed by the host to his\nguest agree literally with those which the Atharva-veda prescribes for the\nreception of a Vratya. Haradatta too, in his commentary, expresses the same\nopinion. Actual quotations from the Atharva-veda are not frequent in Vedic\nliterature, and the fact that \xc3\x82pastamba\'s Dharma-sutra contains one, is,\ntherefore, of some interest.\n\nBesides these Vedic texts 5, \xc3\x82pastamba mentions, also, the A\xe1\xb9\x85gas or auxiliary\nworks, and enumerates six classes, viz. treatises on the ritual of the\nsacrifices, on grammar, astronomy, etymology, recitation of the Veda, and\nmetrics 6. The number is the same as that which is considered the correct one\nin our days 7.\n\nAs the Dharma-sutra names no less than nine teachers in connection with\nvarious topics of the sacred law, and frequently appeals to the opinion of\nsome (eke), it follows that a great many such auxiliary treatises must have\nexisted in \xc3\x82pastamba\'s time. The \xc3\x82 _k_ aryas mentioned are Eka, Ka _n_ va, Ka\n_n_ va, Ku _n_ ika, Kutsa, Kautsa, Pushkarasadi,\n\np. xxviii\n\n[paragraph continues] Varshyaya _n_ i, _S_ vetaketu, and Harita 1. Some of\nthese persons, like Harita and Ka _n_ va, are known to have composed Sutras on\nthe sacred law, and fragments or modified versions of their works are still in\nexistence, while Ka _n_ va, Kautsa, Pushkarasadi or Paushkarasadi, as the\ngrammatically correct form of the name is, and Varshyaya _n_ i are quoted in\nthe Nirukta, the Prati _s_ akhyas, and the Varttikas on Pa _n_ ini as\nauthorities on phonetics, etymology, and grammar 2. Ka _n_ va, finally, is\nconsidered the author of the still existing Kalpa-sutras of the Ka _n_ va\nschool connected with the White Ya _g_ ur-veda. It seems not improbable that\nmost of these teachers were authors of complete sets of A\xe1\xb9\x85gas. Their position\nin Vedic literature, however, except as far as Ka _n_ va, Harita, and _S_\nvetaketu are concerned, is difficult to define, and the occurrence of their\nnames throws less light on the antiquity of the \xc3\x82pastambiya school than might\nbe expected. Regarding Harita it must, however, be noticed that he is one of\nthe oldest authors of Sutras, that he was an adherent of the Maitraya _n_ iya\n_S_ akha 3, and that he is quoted by Baudhayana, \xc3\x82pastamba\'s predecessor. The\nbearing of the occurrence of _S_ vetaketu\'s name will be discussed below.\n\nOf even greater interest than the names of the teachers are the indications\nwhich \xc3\x82pastamba gives, that he knew two of the philosophical schools which\nstill exist in India, viz. the Purva or Karma Mima _m_ sa and the Vedanta. As\nregards the former, he mentions it by its ancient name, Nyaya, which in later\ntimes and at present is usually applied to the doctrine of Gautama Akshapada.\nIn two passages 4 he settles contested points on the authority of those who\nknow the Nyaya, i.e. the Purva Mima _m_ sa, and\n\np. xxix\n\nin several other cases he adopts a line of reasoning which fully agrees with\nthat followed in _G_ aimini\'s Mima _m_ sa-sutras. Thus the arguments 1, that\n\'a revealed text has greater weight than a custom from which a revealed text\nmay be inferred,\' and that \'no text can be inferred from a custom for which a\nworldly motive is apparent,\' exactly correspond with the teaching of _G_\naimini\'s Mima _m_ sa-sutras I, 3, 3-4. The wording of the passages in the two\nworks does not agree so closely that the one could be called a quotation of\nthe other. But it is evident, that if \xc3\x82pastamba did not know the Mima _m_ sa-\nsutras of _G_ aimini, he must have possessed some other very similar work. As\nto the Vedanta, \xc3\x82pastamba does not mention the name of the school. But Kha _n_\n_d_ as 22, 23 of the first Pa _t_ ala of the Dharma-sutra unmistakably contain\nthe chief tenets of the Vedantists, and recommend the acquisition of the\nknowledge of the \xc3\x82tman as the best means for purifying the souls of sinners.\nThough these two Kha _n_ _d_ as are chiefly filled with quotations, which, as\nthe commentator states, are taken from an Upanishad, still the manner of their\nselection, as well as \xc3\x82pastamba\'s own words in the introductory and concluding\nSutras, indicates that he knew not merely the unsystematic speculations\ncontained in the Upanishads and \xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas, but a well-defined system of\nVedantic philosophy identical with that of Badaraya _n_ a\'s Brahma-sutras. The\nfact that \xc3\x82pastamba\'s Dharma-sutra contains indications of the existence of\nthese two schools of philosophy, is significant as the Purva Mima _m_ sa\noccurs in one other Dharma-sutra only, that attributed to Vasish _th_ a, and\nas the name of the Vedanta school is not found in any of the prose treatises\non the sacred law.\n\nOf non-Vedic works \xc3\x82pastamba mentions the Pura _n_ a. The Dharma-sutra not\nonly several times quotes passages from \'a Pura _n_ a\' as authorities for its\nrules 2, but names in one case the Bhavishyat-pura _n_ a as the particular\nPura _n_ a from which the quotation is taken 3. References to the\n\np. xxx\n\n[paragraph continues] Pura _n_ a in general are not unfrequent in other Sutras\non the sacred law, and even in older Vedic works. But \xc3\x82pastamba, as far as I\nknow, is the only Surakara who specifies the title of a particular Pura _n_ a,\nand names one which is nearly or quite identical with that of a work existing\nin the present day, and he is the only one, whose quotations can be shown to\nbe, at least in part, genuine Paura _n_ ic utterances.\n\nAmong the so-called Upa-pura _n_ as we find one of considerable extent which\nbears the title Bhavishya-pura _n_ a or also Bhavishyat-pura _n_ a 1. It is\ntrue that the passage quoted in the Dharma-sutra from the Bhavishyat-pura _n_\na is not to be found in the copy of the Bhavishya-pura _n_ a which I have\nseen. It is, therefore, not possible to assert positively that \xc3\x82pastamba knew\nthe present homonymous work. Still, considering the close resemblance of the\ntwo titles, and taking into account the generally admitted fact that most if\nnot all Pura _n_ as have been remodelled and recast 2, it seems to me not\nunlikely that \xc3\x82pastamba\'s\n\np. xxxi\n\nauthority was the original on which the existing Upa-pura _n_ a is based. And\nin favour of this view it may be urged that passages, similar to \xc3\x82pastamba\'s\nquotation, actually occur in our Paura _n_ ic texts. In the _G_ yotishpra _k_\nara section of several of the chief Pura _n_ as we find, in connection with\nthe description of the Path of the Manes (pit _ri_ ya _n_ a) 1, the assertion\nthat the pious sages, who had offspring and performed the Agnihotra, reside\nthere until the general destruction of created things (a bhutasa _m_ plavat),\nas well as, that in the beginning of each new creation they are the\npropagators of the world (lokasya sa _m_ tanakara _h_ ) and, being re-born,\nre-establish the sacred law. Though the wording differs, these passages fully\nagree in sense with \xc3\x82pastamba\'s Bhavishyat-pura _n_ a which says, \'They (the\nancestors) live in heaven until the (next) general destruction of created\nthings. At the new creation (of the world) they become the seed.\' In other\npassages of the Pura _n_ as, which refer to the successive creations, we find\neven the identical terms used in the quotation. Thus the Vayup., Adhy. 8, 23,\ndeclares that those beings, which have gone to the _G_ analoka, \'become the\nseed at the new creation\' (puna _h_ sarge . . . bi _g_ artha _m_ ta bhavanti\nhi).\n\nThese facts prove at all events that \xc3\x82pastamba took his quotation from a real\nPura _n_ a, similar to those existing. If it is literal and exact, it shows,\nalso, that the Pura _n_ as of his time contained both prose and verse.\n\nFurther, it is possible. to trace yet another of \xc3\x82pastamba\'s quotations from\n\'a Pura _n_ a.\' The three Pura _n_ as, mentioned above, give, immediately\nafter the passages referred to, enlarged versions of the two verses 2\nregarding the sages, who begot offspring and obtained \'burial-grounds,\' and\n\np. xxxii\n\nregarding those who, remaining chaste, gained immortality 1. In this case\n\xc3\x82pastamba\'s quotation can be restored almost completely, if certain\ninterpolations are cut out. And it is evident that \xc3\x82pastamba has preserved\ngenuine Paura _n_ ic verses in their ancient form. A closer study of the\nunfortunately much neglected Pura _n_ as, no doubt, will lead to further\nidentifications of other quotations, which will be of considerable interest\nfor the history of Indian literature.\n\nThere is yet another point on which \xc3\x82pastamba shows a remarkable agreement\nwith a theory which is prevalent in later Sanskrit literature. He says (Dh.\nII, 11, 29, 11-12), \'The knowledge which _S_ udras and women possess, is the\ncompletion of all study,\' and \'they declare that this knowledge is a\nsupplement of the Atharva-veda.\' The commentator remarks with reference to\nthese two Sutras, that \'the knowledge which _S_ udras and women possess,\' is\nthe knowledge of dancing, acting, music, and other branches of the so-called\nArtha _s_ astra, the science of useful arts and of trades, and that the object\nof the Sutras is to forbid the study of such matters before the acquisition of\nsacred learning. His interpretation is, without doubt, correct, as similar\nsentiments are expressed by other teachers in parallel passages. But, if it is\naccepted, \xc3\x82pastamba\'s remark that \'the knowledge of _S_ udras and women is a\nsupplement of the Atharva-veda,\' proves that he knew the division of Hindu\nlearning which is taught in Madhusudana Sarasvati\'s Prasthanabheda 2. For\nMadhusudana allots to each Veda an Upa-veda or supplementary Veda, and asserts\nthat the Upa-veda of the Atharva-veda is the Artha _s_ astra. The agreement of\n\xc3\x82pastamba with the modern writers on this point, furnishes, I think, an\nadditional argument that he belongs to the later Vedic schoolmen.\n\nIn addition to this information regarding the relative position of the\n\xc3\x82pastambiya school in ancient Sanskrit literature, we possess some further\nstatements as to the\n\np. xxxiii\n\npart of India to which it belongs, and these, as it happens, are of great\nimportance for fixing approximately the period in which the school arose.\nAccording to the Brahmanical tradition, which is supported by a hint contained\nin the Dharma-sutra and by, information derivable from inscriptions and the\nactual state of things in modern India, the \xc3\x82pastambiyas belong to Southern\nIndia and their founder probably was a native of or resided in the \xc3\x82ndhra\ncountry. The existence of this tradition, which to the present day prevails\namong the learned Brahmans of Western India and Benares, may be substantiated\nby a passage from the above-mentioned commentary of the _K_ ara _n_ avyuha\n1,which,\n\np. xxxiv\n\nthough written in barbarous Sanskrit, and of quite modern origin, possesses\ngreat interest, because its description of the geographical distribution of\nthe Vedas and Vedic schools is not mentioned elsewhere. The verses from a work\nentitled Mahar _n_ ava, which are quoted there, state that the earth, i.e.\nIndia, is divided into two equal halves by the river Narmada (Nerbudda). and\nthat the school of \xc3\x82pastamba prevails in the southern half (ver. 2). It is\nfurther alleged (ver. 6) that the Ya _g_ ur-veda of Tittiri and the\n\xc3\x82pastambiya school are established in the \xc3\x82ndhra country and other parts of\nthe south and south-east up to the mouth of the Godavari (godasagara-avadhi).\nAccording to the Mahar _n_ ava the latter river marks, therefore, the northern\nfrontier of the territory occupied by the \xc3\x82pastambiyas. which comprises the\nMara _th_ a and Ka _n_ ara districts of the Bombay Presidency, the greater\npart of the Nizam\'s dominions, Berar, and the Madras Presidency with the\nexception of the northern Sirkars and the western coast. This assertion\nagrees, on the whole, with the actual facts which have fallen under my\nobservation. A great number of the De _s_ astha-brahma _n_ as in the Nasik, Pu\n_n_ a, Ahmadnagar, Satara, Sholapur, and Kolhapur districts, and of the Ka _n_\nara or Kar _n_ a _t_ aka-brahma _n_ as in the Belgam, Dharva _d_ , Kala _d_\nghi, and Karva _d_ collectorates, as well as a smaller number among the _K_\nittapavanas of the Ko\xe1\xb9\x85ka _n_ a are \xc3\x82pastambiyas. Of the Nizam\'s dominions and\nthe Madras Presidency I possess no local knowledge. But I can say that I have\nmet many followers of \xc3\x82pastamba among the Teli\xe1\xb9\x85gana-brahma _n_ as settled in\nBombay, and that the frequent occurrence of MSS. containing the Sutras of the\n\xc3\x82pastambiya school in the Madras Presidency proves that the _K_ ara _n_ a\nthere must count many adherents. On the other hand, I have never met with any\n\xc3\x82pastambiyas among the ancient indigenous subdivisions of the Brahmanical\ncommunity dwelling north of the Mara _th_ a country and north of the Narmada.\nA few Brahma _n_ as of this school, no doubt, are scattered over Gu _g_ arat\nand Central India, and others are found in the great places of\n\np. xxxv\n\npilgrimage in Hindustan proper. The former mostly have immigrated during the\nlast century, following the Mara _th_ a chieftains who conquered large\nportions of those countries, or have been imported in the present century by\nthe Mara _th_ a rulers of Gwalior, Indor, and Baroda. The settlers in Benares,\nMathura, and other sacred cities also, have chiefly come in modern times, and\nnot unfrequently live on the bounty of the Mara _th_ a princes. But all of\nthem consider themselves and are considered by the Brahma _n_ as, who are\nindigenous in those districts and towns, as aliens, with whom intermarriage\nand commensality are not permitted. The indigenous sections of the Brahma _n_\nas of Gu _g_ arat, such as the Nagaras, Khe _d_ avals, Bhargavas, Kapilas, and\nMotalas, belong, if they are adherents of the Ya _g_ ur-veda, to the\nMadhyandina or Ka _n_ va schools of the White Ya _g_ ur-veda. The same is the\ncase with the Brahma _n_ as of Ra _g_ putana, Hindustan, and the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _g_\nab. In Central India, too, the White Ya _g_ ur-veda prevails; but, besides the\ntwo schools mentioned above, there are still some colonies of Maitraya _n_\niyas or Manavas 1. It seems, also, that the restriction of the \xc3\x82pastambiya\nschool to the south of India, or rather to those subdivisions of the\nBrahmanical community which for a long time have been settled in the south and\nare generally considered as natives of the south, is not of recent date. For\nit is a significant fact that the numerous ancient landgrants which have been\nfound all over India indicate exactly the same state of things. I am not aware\nthat in any grant issued by a king of a northern dynasty to Brahma _n_ as who\nare natives of the northern half of India, an \xc3\x82pastambiya is mentioned as\ndonee. But among the southern landgrants there are several on which the name\nof the school appears. Thus in a _s_ asana of king Harihara of Vidyanagara,\ndated Sakasa _m_ vat 1317 or 1395 A.D., one of the recipients of the royal\nbounty is \'the learned Ananta Dikshita, son of Ramabha _t_ _t_ a, chief\n\np. xxxvi\n\nof the \xc3\x82pastambya (read \xc3\x82pastambiya) _s_ akha, a scion of the Vasish _th_ a\ngotra 1.\' Further, the eastern _K_ alukya king Vi _g_ ayaditya II 2, who\nruled, according to Dr. Fleet, from A-D. 799-843, presented a village to six\nstudents of the Hira _n_ yake _s_ i-sutra and to eighteen students of the\n\xc3\x82pastamba, _recte_ the \xc3\x82pastamba-sutra. Again, in the abovementioned earlier\ngrant of the Pallava king Nandivarman, there are forty-two students of the\n\xc3\x82pastamba-sutra 3 among the 108 sharers of the village of Udaya _k_\nandrama\xe1\xb9\x85galam. Finally, on an ancient set of plates written in the characters\nwhich usually are called cave-characters, and issued by the Pallava king Si\n_m_ havarman II, we find among the donees five \xc3\x82pastambhiya Brahma _n_ as,\nwho, together with a Haira _n_ yakesa, a Va _g_ asaneya, and a Sama-vedi,\nreceived the village of Ma\xe1\xb9\x85gadur, in Ve\xe1\xb9\x85g\xc5\x8frash _t_ ra 4. This inscription is,\nto judge from the characters, thirteen to fourteen hundred years old, and on\nthis account a very important witness for the early existence of the\n\xc3\x82pastambiyas in Southern India.\n\nUnder the circumstances just mentioned, a casual remark made by \xc3\x82pastamba, in\ndescribing the _S_ raddhas or funeral oblations, acquires considerable\nimportance. He says (Dh. II, 7, 17, 17) that the custom of pouring water into\nthe hands of Brahma _n_ as invited to a _S_ raddha prevails among the\nnortherners, and he indicates thereby that he himself does not belong to the\nnorth of India. If this statement is taken together with the above-stated\nfacts, which tend to show that the \xc3\x82pastambiyas were and are restricted to the\nsouth of India, the most probable construction which can be put on it is that\n\xc3\x82pastamba declares himself to be a southerner. There is yet another indication\nto the same effect contained in the Dharma-sutra. It has been pointed\n\np. xxxvii\n\nout above that the recension of the Taittiriya \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka which \xc3\x82pastamba\nrecognises is that called the \xc3\x82ndhra text or the version current in the \xc3\x82ndhra\ncountry, by which term the districts in the south-east of India between the\nGodavari and the K _ri_ sh _n_ a have to be understood 1. Now it seems\nexceedingly improbable that a Vedic teacher would accept as authoritative any\nother version of a sacred work except that which was current in his native\ncountry. it would therefore follow, from the adoption of an \xc3\x82ndhra text by\n\xc3\x82pastamba, that he was born in that country, or, at least, had resided there\nso long as to have become naturalised in it. With respect to this conclusion\nit must also be kept in mind that the above-quoted passage from the Mahar _n_\nava particularly specifies the \xc3\x82ndhra country (andhradi) as the seat of the\n\xc3\x82pastambiyas. It may be that this is due to an accident. But it seems to me\nmore probable that the author of the Mahar _n_ ava wished to mark the \xc3\x82ndhra\nterritory as the chief and perhaps as the original residence of the\n\xc3\x82pastambiyas.\n\nThis discovery has, also, a most important bearing on the question of the\nantiquity of the school of \xc3\x82pastamba. It fully confirms the result of the\npreceding enquiry, viz. that the \xc3\x82pastambiyas are one of the later _K_ ara _n_\nas. For the south of India and the nations inhabiting it, such as Kali\xe1\xb9\x85gas,\nDravi _d_ as, Andhras, _K_ olas, and Pa _n_ _d_ yas, do not play any important\npart in the ancient Brahmanical traditions and in the earliest history of\nIndia, the centre of both of which lies in the north-west or at least north of\nthe Vindhya range. Hitherto it has not been shown that the south and the\nsouthern nations are mentioned in any of the Vedic Sa _m_ hitas. In the Brahma\n_n_ as and in the Sutras they do occur, though they are named rarely and in a\nnot complimentary manner. Thus the Aitareya-brahma _n_ a gives the names of\ncertain degraded, barbarous tribes, and among them that of the Andhras 2, in\nwhose country, as\n\np. xxxviii\n\nhas been shown, the \xc3\x82pastambiyas probably originated. Again, Baudhayana, in\nhis Dharma-sutra I, i, quotes song verses in which it is said that he who\nvisits the Kali\xe1\xb9\x85gas must purify himself by the performance of certain\nsacrifices in order to become fit for again associating with Aryans. The same\nauthor, also, mentions distinctive forbidden practices (a _k_ ara) prevailing\nin the south (loc. cit.). Further, Pa _n_ ini\'s grammatical Sutras and\nKatyayana\'s Varttikas thereon contain rules regarding several words which\npresuppose an acquaintance with the south and the kingdoms which flourished\nthere. Thus Pa _n_ ini, IV, 2, 98, teaches the formation of dakshi _n_ atya in\nthe sense of \'belonging to or living in the south or the Dekhan,\' and a\nVarttika of Katyayana on Pa _n_ ini, IV, 1, 175, states that the words _K_ ola\nand Pa _n_ _d_ ya are used as names of the princes ruling over the Kola and Pa\n_n_ _d_ ya countries, which, as is known from history, were situated in the\nextreme south of India. The other southern nations and a fuller description of\nthe south occur first in the Mahabharata 1. While an acquaintance with the\nsouth can thus be proved only by a few books belonging to the later stages of\nVedic literature, several of the southern kingdoms are named already in the\noldest historical documents. A _s_ oka in his edicts 2, which date from the\nsecond half of the third century B.C., calls the _K_ olas, Pa _n_ _d_ yas, and\nthe Keralaputra or Ketalaputra his pratyantas (pra _k_ anta) or neighbours.\nThe same monarch informs us also that he conquered the province of Kali\xe1\xb9\x85ga and\nannexed it to his kingdom 3, and his remarks on the condition of the province\nshow that it was thoroughly imbued with the Aryan civilisation. 4. The same\nfact is attested still more clearly by the annals of the _K_ eta king of\nKali\xe1\xb9\x85ga, whose thirteenth year fell in the 165th year of the Maurya era, or\nabout 150 B.C. 5 The early\n\np. xxxix\n\nspread of the Aryan civilisation to the eastern coast-districts between the\nGodavari and the K _ri_ sh _n_ a is proved by the inscriptions on the Bha _t_\n_t_ iprolu relic caskets, which probably belong to the period of 200 B.C. 1\nNumerous inscriptions in the Buddhist caves of Western India 2, as well as\ncoins, prove the existence during the last centuries before, and the first\ncenturies after, the beginning of our era of a powerful empire of the Andhras,\nthe capital of which was probably situated near the modern Amaravati an the\nlower K _ri_ sh _n_ a. The princes of the latter kingdom, though great patrons\nof the Buddhist monks, appear to have been Brahmanists or adherents of the\nancient orthodox faith which is founded on the Vedas. For one of them is\ncalled Vedisiri (vedi _s_ ri), \'he whose glory is the Vedi,\' and another Ya\n_\xc3\xb1_ asiri (ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ asri), \'he whose glory is the sacrifice,\' and a very\nremarkable inscription on the Nanaghat 3 contains a curious catalogue of\nsacrificial fees paid to priests (dakshi _n_ a) for the performance of _S_\nrauta sacrifices. For the third and the later centuries of our era the\ninformation regarding Southern India becomes fuller and fuller. Very numerous\ninscriptions, the accounts of the Buddhist chroniclers of Ceylon, of the Greek\ngeographers, and of the Chinese pilgrims, reveal the existence and give\nfragments, at least, of the history of many kingdoms in the south, and show\nthat their civilisation was an advanced one, and did not differ materially\nfrom that of Northern India.\n\nThere can be no doubt that the south of India has been conquered by the\nAryans, and has been brought within the pale of Brahmanical civilisation much\nlater than India north of the Vindhya range. During which century precisely\nthat conquest took place, cannot be determined for the present. But it would\nseem that it happened a considerable time before the Vedic period came to an\nend, and it certainly was an accomplished fact, long before the\n\np. xl\n\nauthentic history of India begins, about 500 B.C., with the Persian conquest\nof the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ab and Sindh. It may be added that a not inconsiderable\nperiod must have elapsed after the conquest of the south, before the Aryan\ncivilisation had so far taken root in the conquered territory, that, in its\nturn, it could become a centre of Brahmanical activity, and that it could\nproduce new Vedic schools.\n\nThese remarks will suffice to show that a Vedic _K_ ara _n_ a which had its\norigin in the south, cannot rival in antiquity those whose seat is in the\nnorth, and that all southern schools must belong to a comparatively recent\nperiod of Vedic history. For this reason, and because the name of \xc3\x82pastamba\nand of the \xc3\x82pastambiyas is not mentioned in any Vedic work, not even in a\nKalpa-sutra, and its occurrence in the older grammatical books, written before\nthe beginning of our era, is doubtful 1, it might be thought advisable to fix\nthe terminus a quo for the composition of the \xc3\x82pastambiya-sutras about or\nshortly before the beginning of the era, when the Brahmanist \xc3\x82ndhra kings held\nthe greater part of the south under their sway. It seems to me, however, that\nsuch a hypothesis is not tenable, as there are several points which indicate\nthat the school and its writings possess a much higher antiquity. For, first,\nthe Dharma-sutra contains a remarkable passage in which its author states that\n_S_ vetaketu, one of the Vedic teachers who is mentioned in the _S_ atapatha-\nBrahma _n_ a and in the _Kh_ andogya Upanishad, belongs to the Avaras, to the\nmen of later, i.e. of his own times. The passage referred to, Dh. I, 2, 5,\n4-6, has been partly quoted above in order to show that \xc3\x82pastamba laid no\nclaim to the title _Ri_ shi, or seer of revealed texts. It has been stated\nthat according to Sutra 4, \'No _Ri_ shis are born among the Avaras, the men of\nlater ages, on account of the prevailing transgression of the rules of\nstudentship;\' and that according to Sutra 5,\n\np. xli\n\n[paragraph continues] \'Some in their new birth become similar to _Ri_ shis by\ntheir knowledge of the Veda ( _s_ rutarshi) through a residue of merit\nacquired in former existences.\' In order to give an illustration of the latter\ncase, the author adds in Sutra 6, \'Like _S_ vetaketu.\' The natural, and in my\nopinion, the only admissible interpretation of these words is that \xc3\x82pastamba\nconsiders _S_ vetaketu to be one of the Avaras, who by virtue of a residue of\nmerit became a _S_ rutarshi. This is also the view of the commentator\nHaradatta, who, in elucidation of Sutra 6, quotes the following passage from\nthe _Kh_ andogya Upanishad (VI, 1, 1-2):\n\n\'1. Verily, there lived _S_ vetaketu, a descendant of Aru _n_ a. His father\nspake unto him, "O _S_ vetaketu, dwell as a student (with a, teacher); for,\nverily, dear child, no one in our family must neglect the study of the Veda\nand become, as it were, a Brahma _n_ a in name only."\n\n\'Verily, he ( _S_ vetaketu) was initiated at the age of twelve years, and when\ntwenty-four years old be had learned all the Vedas; he thought highly of\nhimself and was vain of his learning and arrogant.\'\n\nThere can be no doubt that this is the person and the story referred to in the\nDharma-sutra. For the fact which the Upanishad mentions, that _S_ vetaketu\nlearned all the Vedas in twelve years, while, the Sm _ri_ tis declare forty-\neight years to be necessary for the accomplishment of that task, makes\n\xc3\x82pastamba\'s illustration intelligible and appropriate. A good deal more is\ntold in the _Kh_ andogya Upanishad about this _S_ vetaketu, who is said to\nhave been the son of Uddalaka and the grandson of Aru _n_ a (aru _n_ eya). The\nsame person is also frequently mentioned in the _S_ atapatha-Brahma _n_ a. In\none passage of the latter work, which has been translated by Professor Max\nMuller 1, it is alleged that he was a contemporary of Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, the\npromulgator of the White Ya _g_ ur-veda, and of the learned king _G_ anaka of\nVideha, who asked him about the meaning of the Agnihotra sacrifice, Now, as\nhas been shown above, \xc3\x82pastamba knew and quotes the White Ya _g_ ur-veda and\n\np. xlii\n\nthe _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a. The passage of the latter work, which he\nquotes, is even taken from the same book in which the story about _S_ vetaketu\nand _G_ anaka occurs. The fact, therefore, that \xc3\x82pastamba places a teacher\nwhom he must have considered as a contemporary of the promulgator of the White\nYa _g_ ur-veda among the Avaras, is highly interesting and of some importance\nfor the history of Vedic literature. On the one hand it indicates that\n\xc3\x82pastamba cannot have considered the White Ya _g_ ur-veda, such as it has been\nhanded down in the schools of the _K_ a _n_ vas and Madhyandinas, to belong to\na remote antiquity. On the other hand it makes the inference which otherwise\nmight be drawn from the southern origin of the \xc3\x82pastambiya school and from the\nnon-occurrence: of its name in the early grammatical writings, viz. that its\nfounder lived not long before the beginning of our era, extremely improbable.\nFor even if the term Avara is not interpreted very strictly and allowed to\nmean not exactly a contemporary, but a person of comparatively recent times,\nit will not be possible to place between _S_ vetaketu and \xc3\x82pastamba a longer\ninterval than, at the utmost, two or three hundred years. _S_ vetaketu and Ya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya would accordingly, at the best, find their places in the\nfourth or fifth century B.C., and the _S_ atapatha-Brahma _n_ a as well as all\nother Vedic works, which narrate incidents from their lives, must have been\ncomposed or at least edited still later. Though little is known regarding the\nhistory of the Vedic texts, still it happens that we possess some information\nregarding the texts in question. For we know from a statement made by\nKatyayana in a Varttika on Pa _n_ ini IV, 3, 105, and from Pata _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ali\'s\ncommentary on his words that the Brahma _n_ a proclaimed by Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya, i.e. the _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a of the White Ya _g_ ur-veda, was\nconsidered to have been promulgated by one of the Ancients, in the times of\nthese two writers, i.e. probably in the fourth and second centuries B.C. 1\n\np. xliii\n\nThese considerations will show that it is necessary to allow for \xc3\x82pastamba a\nmuch higher antiquity than the first century B.C.\n\nThe same inference may also be drawn from another series of facts, viz. the\npeculiarities of the language of his Sutras. The latter are very considerable\nand very remarkable. They may be classed under four heads. In the \xc3\x82pastambiya\nDharma-sutra we have, first, archaic words and forms either occurring in other\nVedic writings or formed according to the analogy of Vedic usage; secondly,\nancient forms and words specially prescribed by Pa _n_ ini, which have not\nbeen traced except in \xc3\x82pastamba\'s Sutras; thirdly, words and forms which are\nboth against Vedic usage and against Pa _n_ ini\'s rules, and which sometimes\nfind their analogies in the ancient Prakrits; and fourthly, anomalies in the\nconstruction of sentences. To the first class belong, kravyadas, I, 7, 21, 15,\ncarnivorous, formed according to the analogy of _ri_ _s_ adas; the frequent\nuse of the singular dara, e.g. II, 1, 1, 17-18, a wife, instead of the plural\ndara _h_ ; salav _ri_ ki, I, 3, 10, 19, for salav _ri_ ki; the substitution of\n_l_ for _r_ in ple\xe1\xb9\x85kha, I, 11, 31, 14; occasional\n\np. xliv\n\noffences against the rules of internal and external Sandhi, e.g. in ag _ri_\nhyamanakara _n_ a _h_ , I, 4, 12, 8; in skuptva, I, 11, 31, 22, the irregular\nabsolutive of skubh or of sku; in paduna, I, 1, 2, 13; in adha _s_ ana _s_\nayin, I, 19, 2, 21 and in sarvatopeta, I, 6, 19, 8; the neglect of the rule\nrequiring v _ri_ ddhi in the first syllable of the name Pushkarasadi, I, 10,\n28, 1; the irregular instrumentals vidya, I, 11, 30, 3, for vidyaya, and ni\n_h_ _s_ reyasa, II, 7, 16, 2, for ni _h_ _s_ reyasena; the nominatives dual\navam, I, 7, 20, 6, for avam, and kru _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ akrau _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a, I, 5, 17, 36 for\n\xc2\xb0krau _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ au; and the potentials in ita, such as prakshalayita, I, 1, 2,\n28; abhiprasarayita, I, 25 6, 3, &c.\n\nAmong the words mentioned by Pa _n_ ini, but not traced except in the Dharma-\nsutra, may be enumerated the verb st _ri_ h, to do damage, I, 11, 31, 9; the\nverb s _ri_ \xe1\xb9\x85kh, to sneeze, from which s _ri_ \xe1\xb9\x85khanika, I, 5, 16, 14, and ni\n_h_ _s_ _ri_ \xe1\xb9\x85khana, II, 2, 5, 9, are derived; and the noun vedadhyaya, I, 9,\n24, 6; II, 4, 8, 5, in the sense of a student of the Veda. Words offending\nagainst rules given by Pa _n_ ini, without being either archaic or Prakritic,\nare e.g. sarvannin, I, 6, 18, 33, one who eats anybody\'s food, which,\naccording to Pa _n_ ini V, 2, 9, should be sarvannina; sarpa _s_ irshin, I, 5,\n17, 39; annasa _m_ skart _ri_ , a cook, II, 3, 6, 16; dharmya, righteous, for\ndharmya, I, 2, 7, 21, and elsewhere; divit _ri_ , a gambler, II, 10, 2, 5, 13,\nfor devit _ri_ , the very remarkable form pra _s_ _\xc3\xb1_ ati, I, 1, 4, 1, for pra\n_s_ nati, finds an analogy in the Vedic _s_ nyaptre for _s_ naptre 1 and in\nPali, pa _\xc3\xb1_ ha from pra _s_ _\xc3\xb1_ a for pra _s_ _n_ a; and the curious\ncompounds ava\xe1\xb9\x85gagra, I, 1, 2, 38, para\xe1\xb9\x85gav _ri_ tta, II, 5, 10, 11, where the\nfirst parts show the forms of the nominative instead of the base, and\npratisuryamatsya _h_ , I, 3, 11, 31, which as a copulative compound is wrong,\nthough not without analogies in Prakrit and in later Sanskrit 2. The irregular\nforms caused by the same tendencies as those which effected the formation of\nthe\n\np. xlv\n\n[paragraph continues] Prakrit languages, are, aviprakrami _n_ a, II, 2, 5, 2,\nfor aviprakrama _n_ a, where an _a_ standing in thesi has been changed to _i_\n; sa _m_ v _ri_ tti _h_ , II, 3, 6, 13, sa _m_ vartete, II, 5, 11, 20, and\nparyanta, I, 3, 9, 21, and I, 3, 11, 33 (compare Mara _th_ i a _m_ t for anta\n_h_ ), in each of which a standing before a nasal has been lengthened; a _n_\nika, I, 6, 19, 1, the initial _a_ of which stands for _ri_ , if it really has\nthe meaning of _ri_ _n_ ika, as some commentators asserted; anulepa _n_ a, I,\n3, 11, 13; I, 11, 32, 5, with the Prakritic change of na to _n_ a; vyupa _g_\nava, I, 2, 8, 15, with va for pa; _ri_ tve for _ri_ tvye, where _y_ seems to\nhave been absorbed by the following _e_ ; apa _s_ _s_ ayita, I, 11, 32, 16,\nfor apa _s_ rayita, and bhat _ri_ vyatikrama, I, 10, 28, 20, where _r_ has\nbeen assimilated to the preceding, or has been lost before the following\nconsonant. The irregularities in the construction are less frequent. But in\ntwo Sutras, I, 3, 10, 2, and I, 3, 11, 31, some words which ought to stand in\nthe locative case have the terminations of the nominative, and it looks as if\nthe author had changed his mind about the construction which he meant to use.\nIn a third passage II, 10, 26, 20, _s_ i _s_ na _k_ _kh_ edana _m_ sav _ri_\nsha _n_ asya, the adjective which is intended to qualify the noun _s_ i _s_ na\nhas been placed in the genitive case, though the noun has been made the first\npart of a compound.\n\nThe occurrence of so many irregularities 1 in so small a treatise as the\nDharma-sutra is, proves clearly that the author did not follow Pa _n_ ini\'s\ngrammar, and makes it very unlikely that he knew it at all. If the anomalous\nforms used by \xc3\x82pastamba all agreed with the usage of the other Sutrakaras,\nknown to us, it might be contended that, though acquainted with the rules of\nthe great grammarian, he had elected to adopt by preference the language of\nthe Vedic schools. But this is by no means the case. The majority of the\nirregular forms are peculiar to \xc3\x82pastamba. As it is thus not probable that\n\xc3\x82pastamba employed his peculiar expressions- in obedience to the tradition of\nthe\n\np. xlvi\n\n[paragraph continues] Vedic schools or of his particular school, he must have\neither been unacquainted with Pa _n_ ini or have considered his teachings of\nno great importance. In other words, he must either have lived earlier than Pa\n_n_ ini or before Pa _n_ ini\'s grammar had acquired general fame throughout\nIndia, and become the standard authority for Sanskrit authors. In either case\nso late a date as 150 B. C. or the first century B.C. would not fit. For Pata\n_\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ali\'s Mahabhashya furnishes abundant proof that at the time of its\ncomposition, in the second century B.C., Pa _n_ ini\'s grammar occupied a\nposition similar to that which it holds now, and has held since the beginning\nof our era in the estimation of the learned of India. On linguistic grounds it\nseems to me \xc3\x82pastamba cannot be placed later than the third century B.C., and\nif his statement regarding _S_ vetaketu is taken into account, the lower limit\nfor the composition of his Sutras must be put further back by 150-200 years.\n\nBut sufficient space has already been allotted to these attempts to assign a\ndate to the founder of the \xc3\x82pastambiya school, the result of which, in the\npresent state of our knowledge of the ancient history of India, must remain, I\nfear, less certain and less precise than is desirable. It now is necessary to\nsay, in conclusion, a few words about the history of the text of the Dharma-\nsutra, and about its commentary, the U _g_ _g_ vala V _ri_ tti of Haradatta.\nThe oldest writer with a known date who quotes the \xc3\x82pastambiya Dharma-sutra is\nSa\xe1\xb9\x85kara _k_ arya 1, c. 800 A.D. Even somewhat earlier Kumarila, c. 750, refers\nrepeatedly to a law-book by \xc3\x82pastamba 2. But it is improbable that he had our\nDharma-sutra before him. For he says, p. 138, that \xc3\x82pastamba expressly\nsanctions local usages, opposed to the teaching of the Vedas, for the natives\nof those districts where they had prevailed since ancient times. Now, that is\njust an opinion, which our Dharma-sutra declares to be wrong and refutes\nrepeatedly 3. As it seems\n\np. xlvii\n\nhazardous to impute to a man, like Kumarila, ignorance or spite against\n\xc3\x82pastamba, I am inclined to assume that the great Mima _m_ saka refers to some\nother work, attributed to \xc3\x82pastamba, perhaps the metrical \xc3\x82pastamba-sm _ri_ ti\nwhich Apararka quotes very frequently 1. Among the commentators on Sm _ri_ tis\nthe oldest, who quote the Dharma-sutra, are Medhatithi, the author of the\nManubhashya, and Vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ane _s_ vara, who composed the Mitakshara, the\nwell-known commentary on Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya\'s Dharma- _s_ astra during the\nreign of the _K_ alukya king Vikramaditya VI, of _K_ alukya towards the end of\nthe eleventh century. From that time downwards \xc3\x82pastamba is quoted by almost\nevery writer on law. But the whole text, such as it is given in my edition 2,\nis vouched for only by the commentator Haradatta, who wrote his U _g_ _g_ vala\nV _ri_ tti, at the latest, in the fifteenth century A.D. or possibly 100 years\nearlier 3 . Haradatta was, however, not the first commentator of the Dharma-\nsutra. He frequently quotes the opinions of several predecessors whom he\ndesignates by the general expressions anya _h_ or apara _h_ , i.e. another\n(writer). The fact that the U _g_ _g_ vala was preceded by earlier\ncommentaries which protected the text from corruption, also speaks in favour\nof the authenticity of the latter, which is further attested by the close\nagreement of the Hira _n_ yake _s_ i Dharma-sutra, mentioned above.\n\nAs regards the value of the U _g_ _g_ vala for the explanation of \xc3\x82pastamba\'s\ntext, it certainly belongs to the best commentaries\n\np. xlviii\n\nexisting. Haradatta possessed in the older V _ri_ ttis abundant and good\nmaterials on which he could draw; he himself apparently was, well versed in\nHindu law and in Sanskrit grammar, and distinguished by sobriety and freedom\nfrom that vanity which induces many Indian commentators to load their works\nwith endless and useless quotations. His explanations, therefore, can mostly\nbe followed without hesitation, and, even when they appear unacceptable, they\ndeserve careful consideration.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[ix:1](sbe0202.htm#fr_0) Max Muller, History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature,\np. 133 seq.\n\nThe following letter, addressed to the late W. H. Morley, and published by him\nin his Digest of Indian Cases, 1850, may be of interest as connected with the\nfirst discovery of the \xc3\x82pastamba-sutras:--\n\n_9, Park Place, Oxford, July 29, 1849._\n\nMY DEAR MORLEY,--I have been looking again at the law literature, in order to\nwrite you a note on the sources of Manu. I have treated the subject fully in\nmy introduction to the Veda, where I have given an outline of the different\nperiods of Vaidik literature, and analysed the peculiarities in the style and\nlanguage of each class of Vaidik works. A hat I consider to be the sources of\nthe Manava-dharma- _s_ astra, the so-called Laws of Manu, are the Sutras.\nThese are works which presuppose the development of the prose literature of\nthe Brahma _n_ as (like the Aitareya-brahma _n_ a, Taittirtya-brahma _n_ a,\n&c.) These Brahma _n_ as, again, presuppose, not only the existence, but the\ncollection and arrangement of the old hymns of the four Sa _m_ hitas. The\nSutras are therefore later than both these classes of Vaidik works, but they\nmust be considered as belonging to the Vaidik period of literature, not only\non account of their intimate connection with Vaidik subjects, but also because\nthey still exhibit the irregularities of the old Vaidik language. They form\nindeed the last branch of Vaidik literature; and it will perhaps be possible\nto fix some of these works chronologically, as they are contemporary with the\nfirst spreading of Buddhism in India.\n\nAgain, in the whole of Vaidik literature there is no work written (like the\nManava-dharma- _s_ astra) in the regular epic _S_ loka, and the continuous\nemployment of this metre is a characteristic mark of post-Vaidik writings.\n\nOne of the principal classes of Sutras is known by the name of Kalpa-sutras,\np. x or rules of ceremonies. These are avowedly composed by human authors,\nwhile, according to Indian orthodox theology, both the hymns and Brahma _n_ as\nare to be considered as revelation. The Sutras generally bear the name of\ntheir authors, like the Sutras of \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana, Katyayana, &c., or the name\nof the family to which the Sutras belonged. The great number of these writings\nis to be accounted for by the fact that there was not one body of Kalpa-sutras\nbinding on all Brahmanic families, but that different old families had each\ntheir own Kalpa-sutras. These works are still very frequent in our libraries,\nyet there is no doubt that many of them have been lost. Sutras are quoted\nwhich do not exist in Europe, and the loss of some is acknowledged by the\nBrahmans themselves. There are, however, lists of the old Brahmanic families\nwhich were in possession of their own redaction of Vaidik hymns (Sa _m_\nhitas), of Brahma _n_ as, and of Sutras. Some-of these families followed the\nRig-veda, some the Ya _g_ ur-veda, the Sama-veda, and Atharva-veda; and thus\nthe whole Vaidik literature becomes divided into four great classes of Brahma\n_n_ as and Sutras, belonging to one or the other of the four principal Vedas.\n\nNow one of the families following the Ya _g_ ur-veda was that of the Manavas\n(cf. _K_ ara _n_ avyuha). There can be no doubt that that family, too, had its\nown Sutras. Quotations from Manava-sutras are to be met with in commentaries\non other Sutras; and I have found, not long ago, a MS. which contains the text\nof the Manava- _s_ rauta-sutras, though in a very fragmentary state. But these\nSutras, the _S_ rauta-sutras, treat only of a certain branch of ceremonies\nconnected with the great sacrifices. Complete Sutra works are divided into\nthree parts: 1. the first ( _S_ rauta), treating on the great sacrifices; 2.\nthe second (G _ri_ hya), treating on the Sa _m_ skaras, or the purificatory\nsacraments; 3. the third, (Samaya _k_ arika or Dharma-sutras), treating on\ntemporal duties, customs, and punishments. The last two classes of Sutras seem\nto be lost in the Manava-sutra. This loss is. however, not so great with\nregard to tracing the sources of the Manava-dharma- _s_ astra, because\nwhenever we have an opportunity of comparing Sutras belonging to different\nfamilies, but following the same Veda, and treating on the same subjects, the\ndifferences appear to be very slight, and only refer to less important\nniceties of the ceremonial. In the absence, therefore, of the Manava- samaya\n_k_ arika-sutras, I have taken another collection of Sutras, equally belonging\nto the Ya _g_ ur-veda, the Sutras of \xc3\x82pastamba. In his family we have not only\na Brahma _n_ a, but also \xc3\x82pastamba _S_ rauta, G _ri_ hya, and Samaya _k_\narika-sutras. Now it is, of course, the third class of Sutras, on temporal\nduties, which are most likely to contain the sources of the later metrical\nCodes of Law, written in the classical _S_ loka. On a comparison of different\nsubjects, such as the duties of a Brahma _k_ arin, a G _ri_ hastha, laws of\ninheritance, duties of a king, forbidden fruit, &c., I find that the Sutras\ncontain generally almost the same words which have been brought into verse by\nthe compiler of the Manava-dharma-sutra. p. xi I consider, therefore, the\nSutras as the principal source of the metrical Sm _ri_ tis, such as the\nManava-dharma- _s_ astra, Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya-dharma- _s_ astra, &c., though\nthere are also many other verses in these works which may be traced to\ndifferent sources. They are paraphrases of verses of the Sa _m_ hitas, or of\npassages of the Brahma _n_ as, often retaining the same old words and archaic\nconstructions which were in the original. This is indeed acknowledged by the\nauthor of the Manava-dharma- _s_ astra, when he says (B. II, v. 6), \'The roots\nof the Law are the whole Veda (Sa _m_ hitas and Brahma _n_ as), the customs\nand traditions of those who knew the Veda (as laid down in the Sutras), the\nconduct of good men, and one\'s own satisfaction.\' The Manava-dharma- _s_ astra\nmay thus be considered as the last redaction of the laws of the Manavas. Quite\ndifferent is the question as to the old Manu from whom the family probably\nderived its origin, and who is said to have been the author of some very\ncharacteristic hymns in the Rig-veda-sa _m_ hita. He certainly cannot be\nconsidered as the author of a Manava-dharma-sutra, nor is there even any\nreason to suppose the author of this work to have had the same name. It is\nevident that the author of the metrical Code of Laws speaks of the old Manu as\nof a person different from himself, when he says (B. X, v. 63), \'Not to kill,\nnot to lie, not to steal, to keep the body clean, and to restrain the senses,\nthis was the short law which Manu proclaimed amongst the four castes.\'--Yours\ntruly, M.

Dr. Burnell, Tanjore\nCatalogue, p. 34, too, considers Baudhayana to be older than \xc3\x82pastamba,\nbecause his style is so much simpler. With this remark may be compared Dr.\nWinternitz\'s very true assertion that Baudhayana\'s style resembles sometimes,\nespecially in the discussion of disputed points, that of the Brahma _n_ as. On\nthe other hand, Dr. R. G. Bha _n_ _d_ arkar, Second Report on the Search for\nSanskrit MSS., p. 34, believes Baudhayana to be later than \xc3\x82pastamba and\nBharadva _g_ a, because he teaches other developments of sacrificial rites,\nunknown to the other two Sutrakaras. This may be true, but it must not be\nforgotten that every portion of Baudhayana\'s Sutras, which has been subjected\nto a critical enquiry, has turned out to be much interpolated and enlarged by\nlater hands.\n\n[xxiv:1](sbe0202.htm#fr_28) The subjoined pedigree of the Sutrakaras of the\nBlack Ya _g_ ur-veda will perhaps make the above remarks and my interpretation\nof the statements of Mahadeva and the other authorities mentioned above more\nintelligible:--\n\n**Kh a _n_ _d_ ika**, taught the Taittiriya recension of the Black Ya _g_ ur-\nveda.  \n(Successors of Kha _n_ _d_ ika, number unknown, down to)\n\n**Baudh ayana**, Prava _k_ anakarta, i.e. 1st Sutrakara, and founder of\nBaudhayana- _k_ ara _n_ a.  \n(Successors of Baudhayana down to fellow-pupil of Bharadva _g_ a, number\nunknown.)  \n(Successors of Baudhayana after the schism down to the present day.)\n\n**Bh aradva _g_ a**, 2nd Sutrakara, and founder of Bharadva _g_ a- _k_ ara _n_\na.  \n(Successors of Bharadva _g_ a down to fellow-pupil of \xc3\x82pastamba, number\nunknown.)  \n(Successors after the schism down to the present day.)\n\n**\xc3\x82 pastamba**, 3rd Sutrakara, and founder of \xc3\x82pastamba- _k_ ara _n_ a.  \n(Successors of \xc3\x82pastamba down to fellow-pupil of Satyasha _dh_ a Hira _n_ yake\n_s_ in, number unknown.)  \n(successors of \xc3\x82pastamba down to the present day.)\n\n**Saty asha _dh_ a Hira _n_ yake _s_ in**, 4th Sutrakara, and founder of Hira\n_n_ yake _s_ i- _k_ ara _n_ a.  \n(Successors of Satyasha _dh_ a Hira _n_ yake _s_ in down to the present day.)\n\nAfter the schism of Satyasha _dh_ a Hira _n_ yake _s_ in the pedigree has not\nbeen continued, though Mahadeva asserts that several other Sutrakaras arose.\nBut to work it out further would be useless.\n\n[xxiv:2](sbe0202.htm#fr_29) See Appendix II to Part I of my second edition of\n\xc3\x82pastamba\'s Dharma-sutra, p. 117 seqq.\n\n[xxv:1](sbe0202.htm#fr_30) Compare also Dr. Winternitz\'s remarks on the\ndependence of the G _ri_ hya-sutra of the Hira _n_ yake _s_ ins on\n\xc3\x82pastamba\'s, op. cit., p. 6 seqq., and the second edition of the \xc3\x82p.

Though I fully subscribe to the\nopinion, held by the most illustrious Sanskritists, that, in general, the\nexisting Pura _n_ as are not identical with the works designated by that title\nin Vedic works, still I cannot believe that they are altogether independent of\nthe latter. Nor can I agree to the assertion that the Pura _n_ as known to us,\none and all, are not older than the tenth or eleventh century A.D. That is\ninadmissible, because Beruni (India, I, 131) enumerates them as canonical\nbooks. And his frequent quotations from them prove that in 1030 A. D. they did\nnot differ materially from those known to us (see Indian Antiquary, 19, 382\nseqq.). Another important fact bearing on this point may be mentioned here,\nviz. that the poet Ba _n_ a, who wrote shortly after 600 A.D., in the S _r\ni_hatsha _k_ arita, orders his Paura _n_ ika to recite the Pavanaprokta-pura\n_n_ a, i.e. the Vayu-pura _n_ a (Harsha _k_ arita, p. 61, Calcutta ed.). Dr.\nHall, the discoverer of the life of Harsha, read in his copy Yavanaprokta-pura\n_n_ a, a title which, as he remarks, might suggest the idea that Ba _n_ a knew\nthe Greek epic poetry. But a comparison of the excellent Ahmadabad and Benares\nDevanagari MSS. and of the Ka _s_ mir _S_ arada copies shows that the correct\nreading is the one given above. The earlier history of the Pura _n_ as, which\nas yet is a mystery, will only be cleared up when a real history of the\northodox Hindu sects, especially of the _S_ ivites and Vish _n_ uites, has\nbeen written. It will, then, probably become apparent that the origin of these\nsects reaches back far beyond the rise of Buddhism and Jainism. It will also\nbe proved p. xxxi that the orthodox sects used Pura _n_ as as text books for\npopular readings, the Pura _n_ apa _th_ ana of our days, and that some, at\nleast, of the now existing Pura _n_ as are the latest recensions of those\nmentioned in Vedic books.\n\n[xxxi:1](sbe0202.htm#fr_49) Vayup., Adhy. .50, 208 seqq.; Matsyap., Adhy. 123,\n96 seqq.; Vish _n_ up.

As regards the explanation of Katyayana\'s and Pata _\xc3\xb1_ _g_\nali\'s words, I side with Kaiya _t_ a and Professor Goldstucker. But I am\nunable to follow the latter in the inferences which he draws from the fact,\nthat Katyayana and Pata _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ali declare Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya and other sages\nto be as ancient as those whose Brahma _n_ as and Kalpas are designated by the\nplural of adjectives formed by the addition of the affix in to the names of\nthe promulgators. Though Pa _n_ ini asserts, IV, 3, 105, that only those\nBrahma _n_ as which are known by appellations like Bhallavina _h_ ,\nKaushitakina _h_ , &c, have been proclaimed by ancient sages, and though\nKatyayana and the author of the Great Commentary add that this rule does not\nhold good in the case of the work called Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkani Brahma _n_ ani,\nit does not necessarily follow, as Professor Goldstucker thinks, that an\nextraordinarily long interval lies between Pa _n_ ini and Katyayana-so long a\nperiod that what Pa _n_ ini considered to be recent had become ancient in\nKatyayana\'s time. Professor Weber has rightly objected to this reasoning. The\ndifference between the statements of the two grammarians may have been caused\nby different traditions prevailing in different schools, or by an oversight on\nthe part of Pa _n_ ini, which, as the scene of Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya\'s activity\nseems to have been Videha in eastern India, while Pa _n_ ini belonged to the\nextreme north-west, is not at all improbable. As regards the two dates, I\nplace, following, with Professor Max Muller, the native tradition, Katyayana\nin the fourth century B.C., and Pata _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ali, with Professors Goldstucker,\nKern, and Bha _n_ _d_ arkar, between 178-140 B.C.\n\n[xliv:1](sbe0202.htm#fr_72) Wackernagel, Altindische Grammatik, vol. i, p.\nxxxiii.\n\n[xliv:2](sbe0202.htm#fr_73) See Zeitschr. d.
