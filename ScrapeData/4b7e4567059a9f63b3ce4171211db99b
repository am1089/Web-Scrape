Battle-charm.\n\n1\\. May Indra churn (the enemy), he, the churner, Sakra (mighty), the hero,\nthat pierces the forts, so that we shall slay the armies of the enemies a\nthousandfold!  \n2\\. May the rotten rope, wafting itself against yonder army, turn it into a\nstench. When the enemies see from afar our smoke and fire, fear shall they lay\ninto their hearts!  \n3\\. Tear asunder those (enemies), O asvattha (ficus religiosa), devour (khada)\nthem, O! khadira (acacia catechu) in lively style! Like the tagadbhanga\n(ricinus communis) they shall be broken (bhagyantam), may the vadhaka (a\ncertain kind of tree) slay them with his weapons (vadhaih)!  \n4\\. May the knotty ahva-plant put knots upon yonder (enemies), may the vadhaka\nslay them with his weapons! Bound up in (our) great trap-net, they shall\nquickly be broken as an arrow-reed!  \n5\\. The atmosphere was the net, the great regions (of space) the (supporting)\npoles of the net: with these Sakra (mighty Indra) did surround and scatter the\narmy of the Dasyus.  \n6\\. Great, forsooth, is the net of great Sakra, who is rich in steeds: with it\ninfold thou all the enemies, so that not one of them shall be released!  \n7\\. Great is the net of thee, great Indra, hero, that art equal to a thousand,\nand hast hundredfold might. With that (net) Sakra slew a hundred, thousand,\nten thousand, a hundred million foes, having surrounded them with (his) army.  \n8\\. This great world was the net of great Sakra: with this net of Indra I\ninfold all those (enemies) yonder in darkness,  \n9\\. With great dejection, failure, and irrefragable misfortune; with fatigue,\nlassitude, and confusion, do I surround all those (enemies) yonder.  \n10\\. To death do I hand them over, with the fetters of death they have been\nbound. To the evil messengers of death do I lead them captive.  \n11\\. Guide ye those (foes), ye messengers of death; ye messengers of Yama,\ninfold them! Let more than thousands be slain; may the club of Bhava crush\nthem!  \n12\\. The Sadhyas (blessed) go holding up with might one support of the net,\nthe Rudras another, the Vasus another, (Still) another is upheld by the\n\xc3\x82dityas.  \n13\\. All the gods shall go pressing from above with might; the Angiras shall\ngo on the middle (of the net), slaying the mighty army!  \n14\\. The trees, and (growths) that are like trees, the plants and the herbs as\nwell; two-footed and four-footed creatures do I impel, that they shall slay\nyonder army!  \n15\\. The Gandharvas and Apsaras, the serpents and the gods, holy men and\n(deceased) Fathers, the visible and invisible (beings), do I impel, that they\nshall slay yonder army!  \n16\\. Scattered here are the fetters of death; when thou steppest upon them\nthou shalt not escape! May this hammer slay (the men) of yonder army by the\nthousand!  \n17\\. The gharma (sacrificial hot drink) that has been heated by the fire, this\nsacrifice (shall) slay thousands! Do ye, Bhava and Sarva, whose arms are\nmottled, slay yonder army!  \n18\\. Into the (snare of) death they shall fall, into hunger, exhaustion,\nslaughter, and fear! O Indra and Sarva, do ye with trap and net slay yonder\narmy!  \n19\\. Conquered, O foes, do ye flee away; repelled by (our) charm, do ye run!\nOf yonder host, repulsed by Brihaspati, not one shall be saved!  \n20\\. May their weapons fall from their (hands), may they be unable to lay the\narrow on (the bow)! And then (our) arrows shall smite them, badly frightened,\nin their vital members!  \n21\\. Heaven and earth shall shriek at them, and the atmosphere, along with the\ndivine powers! Neither aider, nor support did they find; smiting one another\nthey shall go to death!  \n22\\. The four regions are the she-mules of the god's chariot, the purodasas\n(sacrificial rice-cakes) the hoofs, the atmosphere the seat (of the wagon).\nHeaven and earth are its two sides, the seasons the reins, the intermediate\nregions the attendants, Vak (speech) the road.  \n23\\. The year is the chariot, the full year is the body of the chariot, Virag,\nthe pole, Agni the front part of the chariot. Indra is the (combatant)\nstanding on the left of the chariot, Kandramas (the moon) the charioteer.  \n24\\. Do thou win here, do thou conquer here, overcome, win, hail! These here\nshall conquer, those yonder be conquered! Hail to these here, perdition to\nthose yonder! Those yonder do I envelop in blue and red!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 19.
