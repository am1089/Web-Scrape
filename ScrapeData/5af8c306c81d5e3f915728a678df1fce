Suta said :-- The learned Vyasa, the son of Satyavati, and the knower of\nthe Pura _n_ as, when thus asked by Janamejaya, the son of Pariksit, whose\nheart had become calm, replied in the following words, capable to remove all\nhis doubts. Vyasa said :--\n\n\n\n2\\. O king! You would better know, that in this Universe the course of Karma\nis not easily comprehensible; even the Devas are not capable to comprehend the\nwonderful effects of actions; what to speak of men!\n\n\n\n3\\. When this Universe composed of the three Gu _n_ as arose, it was through\nKarma, that everything had its origin.\n\n\n\n4-5. It was the seed of Karma whence the Jivas (the individual embodied souls)\narose with neither any beginning nor any end. Those Jivas go often and often\nincarnating in numberless varieties of wombs and then go to dissolution. When\nthis Karma ceases, the Jivas then are never to have any more connection with\nany other body.\n\n\n\np. 253\n\n\n\n6\\. The Karmas done by Jivas are of three kinds :-- auspicious, inauspicious\nand mixed (partly auspicious and partly inauspicious); of which the auspicious\nis the Sattvik Karma, the inauspicious is the Tamasik Karma and the mixed, is\nthe Rajasic Karma. Thus have been said by the Sages.\n\n\n\n7\\. These three again are subdivided into three. They are Sanchita\n(accumulated), Bhavisya (impending in future) and Prarabdha (commenced). All\nthese Karmas are in dwelling always with the body.\n\n\n\n8-9. O king! Everybody, even Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and Mahes'a all under the\ninfluence of this Karma! And they experience pleasure, pain, old age, disease\nand death, joy and sorrow, lust, anger, greed and other bodily qualities, out\nof the effects of this Karma, which we call ordinarily Fate.\n\n\n\n10-11. Therefore love, hatred and other bodily qualities all predominate\nequally in all bodies. Anger, jealousy, hatred, and other similar qualities\narise in the Devas, men, and birds owing to some sort of dislikes on previous\noccasions; and love, compassion, pity, etc., arise out of some sort of\nlikings, existing already.\n\n\n\n12-13. O king! No individual can arise without some sort of action or other.\nIt is through Karma that the Sun traverses in the sky; it is through Karma\nthat the Moon was attacked with consumption disease; and it is through Karma\nthat the Rudra holds the disc of skull bone. This Karma, therefore, has no\nbeginning nor end (till Mok _s_ a); now that this Karma is the sole cause in\nthe production of this Universe.\n\n\n\n14-16. For this reason, this whole Universe, moveable and immoveable, is real;\nbut Munis are deeply absorbed in meditation to ascertain about its reality or\nunreality. They cannot definitely know it for certain whether this world is\nreal or unreal; for where Maya is prevalent, the universe is there. Where\nthere is the cause fully existing in all respects, there is no effect, how can\nwe say? The Maya is eternal and always acts as the Prime Cause of all.\n\n\n\n17\\. Therefore, O king! the sages declare that the seed of Karma is eternal.\nThis whole universe changes incessantly, being controlled by this karma.\n\n\n\n18\\. O king of kings! They say, it is through the will of Vi _sn_ u, of\nunbounded energy and splendour, that all this universe enters, again and\nagain, into all sorts of wombs, whether good or evil.\n\n\n\n19\\. Now, if the birth of Vi _sn_ u, of infinite prowess, takes place\naccording to His will, then why is it that He travels through many impious\nbirths? Why is it that Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u goes, in different Yugas, to take\nHis births in low, vile origins?\n\n\n\np. 254\n\n\n\nWhere is that self dependent man, who, leaving his abode Vaikun _t_ ha and all\nsorts of pleasures and happiness, desires to live in this mortal temple,\nfilled with urine, faeces and other filthy matters.\n\n\n\n20\\. No intelligent man will leave comfortable resting places and amorous\nsports and gathering flowers for the sake of dwelling in this uterus in the\nwomb?\n\n\n\n21\\. Who likes to live with his face downwards in the womb, when he can enjoy\nfine heavenly soft downs, puffed up with cotton or silk.\n\n\n\n22\\. Who will abandon singing, dancing and music, where all sorts of love\nfeelings are being manifested, and think of coming down to this veritable\nHell?\n\n\n\n23\\. Who will abandon the wonderful ambrosial nectar and prosperity given by\nLak _s_ mi, that cannot be easily renounced, and then like to taste this urine\nand faeces.\n\n\n\n24\\. There is no hell more aggravating in the three worlds than this existence\nin the wombs. The Munis, afraid of these, perform difficult asceticisms in\nthis wondrous world.\n\n\n\n25\\. Wise, intelligent persons renounce their kingdoms and enjoyments and\nresort to forests. Who is there so stupid as to enter willingly in the various\nwombs?\n\n\n\n26\\. Worms and insects torment the Jivas in the womb; the digestive fire of\nthe stomach heats it from below, whereas it is always fearfully tied down on\nall sides by the flesh, enclosing its fat or marrow. O King; Not a trace of\nhappiness is visible there.\n\n\n\n27\\. It is far better to live in a prison house, fettered by hard iron chains.\nWhereas it is not desirable to live for a moment in the womb.\n\n\n\n28\\. It is very hard and painful to be in the womb for ten months. To come out\nof the hard and terrible womb is extremely troublesome.\n\n\n\n29\\. Jivas get trouble in their childhood; they cannot speak, and they do not\nknow what to say, when they are hungry or thirsty; they depend entirely on\nothers and they are grieved.\n\n\n\n30\\. When the child becomes hungry and cries, the mother becomes anxious. When\nthe child is afflicted with diseases and cries, the mother then knows and\nadministers medicines.\n\n\n\n31\\. Thus many troubles arise in childhood. Sages do not therefore find any\nhappiness and do not desire, of their own accord, to come here.\n\n\n\np. 255\n\n\n\n32\\. O king, no sane man, would forego incessant heavenly pleasures and prefer\nbefore the Devas to this toilsome and painful state of being born in the womb.\n\n\n\n33\\. O king of kings! All the Devas, Brahma and others have to enjoy full the\neffects of their Karmas done, whether they are pleasant or painful.\n\n\n\n34\\. O best of kings! The fruits of karma must have to be experienced, whether\nauspicious or inauspicious, be he a Deva, or human being or an animal; any one\nwho has embodied himself in fine or gross bodies!\n\n\n\n35\\. Human beings, by dint of their practise of penance, religious austerities\nalms givings and sacrifices, rise to Indrahood. Indra, in his turn, when the\neffects of his good actions cease, comes down to inferior births! there is no\ndoubt of it.\n\n\n\n36\\. In the Rama Incarnation, the Devas had to incarnate themselves a Monkeys;\nand in the Kri _sn_ a incarnation, the Devas had to incarnate themselves as\nhuman beings, Cow-herds (Gopas) and Yadavas.\n\n\n\n37\\. Thus being urged on by Brahma, Vi _sn_ u Bhagavan incarnates Himself many\ntimes, yugas after yugas, to preserve the religion.\n\n\n\n38\\. O king of mortals! Thus, like a carwheel, Bhagavan Hari incarnated\nHimself in various wombs successively in a wonderful manner.\n\n\n\n39\\. The destruction the of Daityas was done by Hari in His many secondary\nincarnations.\n\n\n\n40\\. Now I will narrate to you the auspicious facts of the birth of Kri _sn_\na, Who incarnated Himself in the family of Yadu (Yadu Kula).\n\n\n\n41\\. O king! The illustrious Vasudeva, born of the part of the Muni Kas'yapa,\nhad to take his birth again as a human being due to his previous curse and had\nto maintain his livelihood by tending cows.\n\n\n\n42\\. O best of kings! And the two wives Kas'yapa, Aditi and Surasa had to take\ntheir births as the two sisters, Devaki and Rohi _n_ i, on account of the\ncurses cast on them. O Descendant of Bharata! We have thus heard that they\nwere greatly cursed at one time by Varu _n_ a, the water deity, who got very\nmuch angry. The king said.\n\n\n\n43-47. What fault was committed by Kas'yapa that he had to take his birth\nalong with his wife as cowherds. And why was it that the Everlasting\nuninterrupted Atman Vi _sn_ u Naraya _n_ a had to take his birth in Gokula. He\nwhose abode is Vaikun _t_ ha, who is the Lord of Rama! who is Bhagavan and the\nSupreme amongst the gods, who is the upholder of the universe and the yugas!\nUnder Whose order can such a being abandon his abode and take his birth in the\nworld like an ordinary mortal? There is this grave doubt, then, of mine on\nthis point.\n\n\n\np. 256\n\n\n\n48-51. Obtaining this depraved human coil, one is always perplexed with\nvarious thoughts, sometimes with lust, anger, jealousy, intoleration, sorrow,\nenmity sometimes with pleasurable feelings, happiness, fear, sufferings,\npenury, sometimes with straight-forwardness, good or bad deeds, faithfulness,\ntreachery, unsteadiness, supporting others; sometimes with remorse,\nhesitation, bragging, greed, vain boasting, delusion, or hypocrisy and\nsometimes with remorse; these different feelings exist in men.\n\n\n\n52\\. How then can Vi _sn_ u Bhagavan abandon His eternal pleasures and have\nrecourse to this human birth, full of many perplexing thoughts.\n\n\n\n53\\. O best of Munis! What peculiar happiness is there in the pleasures of\nhuman births, that S\xc2\x92ri Bhagavan Hari has to undertake the burden of dwelling\nthus in the human wombs?\n\n\n\n54-55. O Munindra! The sufferings that are experienced, while in the womb, the\npain during the time of delivery, the misfortunes in the early childhood, the\ntroubles of passionate lust in youth, the greater sorrows and difficulties in\nthe householder's life, all these are existent there; how then Bhagavan Vi\n_sn_ u incarnate Himself often in these various human births.\n\n\n\n56-57. What an amount of enormous difficulties had Brahma-born Hari to\nundertake in His Rama incarnation! That high souled One had to suffer for his\nexile in forest, for the stealing away of his wife Sita, for the frequent\nwars, for the final separation from his wife Sita.\n\n\n\n58-59. Likewise in the Kri _sn_ a Avatara, the birth in a prison, the\ndeparture to Gokul, tending cows, the killing of Kamsa, departure to Dwarka\nwith great difficulty and all sorts of household difficulties were there. Why\nhad He to suffer all these?\n\n\n\n60\\. Who amongst the wise and the emancipated, of his own accord condescends\nto take on his shoulders so many hard sufferings? This is the grave doubt in\nmy mind; be graciously pleased to remove my this grave doubt and make my mind\ntranquil.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Second Chapter in the Fourth Book of S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of\nthe Maha Pura _n_ am of 18000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 3](bk04ch03.htm)\n\n"
