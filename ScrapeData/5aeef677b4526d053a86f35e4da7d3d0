No one could have rejoiced more\nsincerely than I did at the publication of the Romanised transliteration of\nthe Rig-veda, carried out with so much patience and accuracy by Professor\nAufrecht. It showed that there was a growing interest in this, the only true\nVeda; it showed that even those who could not read Sanskrit in the original\nDevanagari, wished to have access to the original text of these ancient hymns;\nit showed that the study of the Veda had a future before it like no other book\nof Sanskrit literature. My learned friend Professor Aufrecht has been most\nunfairly charged with having printed this Romanised text me insciente vel\ninvito. My edition is publici juris, like any edition of Homer or Plato, and\nanybody might, with proper acknowledgment, have reprinted it, either in Roman\nor Devanagari letters. But far from keeping me in ignorance of his plan,\nProfessor Aufrecht applied to me for the loan of the MSS. of the two Ma _n_\n_d_ alas which I had not yet published, and I lent them to him most gladly,\nbecause, by seeing them printed at once, I felt far less\n\np. liv\n\nguilty in delaying the publication of the last volumes of my edition of the\ntext and commentary. Nor could anything have been more honourable than the way\nin which Professor Aufrecht speaks of the true relation of his Romanised text\nto my edition. That there are misprints, and I, speaking for myself, ought to\nsay mistakes also, in my edition of the Rig-veda, I know but too well; and if\nProfessor Aufrecht, after carefully transcribing every word, could honestly\nsay that their number is small, I doubt whether other scholars will be able to\nprove that their number is large. I believe I may with the same honesty return\nProfessor Aufrecht's compliment, and considering the great difficulty of\navoiding misprints in Romanised transcripts, I have always thought and I have\nalways said that his reprint of the hymns of the Veda is remarkably correct\nand accurate. What, however, I must protest against, and what, I feel sure,\nProfessor Aufrecht himself would equally protest against, is the supposition,\nand more than supposition of certain scholars, that wherever this later Latin\ntranscript differs from my own Devanagari text, Professor Aufrecht is right,\nand I am wrong; that his various readings rest on the authority of new MSS.,\nand constitute in fact a new recension of the Vedic hymns. Against this\nsupposition I must protest most strongly, not for my own sake, but for the\nsake of the old book, and, still more, for the sake of the truth. No doubt it\nis natural to suppose that where a later edition differs from a former\nedition, it does so intentionally; and I do not complain of those who, without\nbeing able to have recourse to MSS. in order to test the authority of various\nreadings, concluded that wherever the new text differed from the old, it was\nbecause the old text was at fault. In order to satisfy my own conscience on\nthis point, I have collated a number of passages where Professor Aufrecht's\ntext differs from my own, and I feel satisfied that in the vast majority of\ncases, I am right and he is wrong, and that his variations do not rest on the\nauthority of MSS. I must not shrink from the duty of making good this\nassertion, and I therefore proceed to an examination of such passages as have\noccurred to me on\n\np. lv\n\noccasionally referring to his text, pointing out the readings both where he is\nright, and where he is wrong. The differences between the two texts may appear\ntrifling, but I shall not avail myself of that plea. On the contrary, I quite\nagree with those scholars who hold that in truly critical scholarship there is\nnothing trifling. Besides, it is in the nature of the case that what may, by a\nstretch of the word, be called various readings in the Veda, must be confined\nto single letters or accents, and can but seldom extend to whole words, and\nnever to whole sentences. I must therefore beg my readers to have patience\nwhile I endeavour to show that the text of the Rig-veda, as first published by\nme, though by no means faultless, was nevertheless not edited in so\nperfunctory a manner as some learned critics seem to suppose, and that it will\nnot be easy to supplant it either by a collation of new MSS., such as are\naccessible at present, or by occasional references to the Prati _s_ akhya.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Part 4](sbe3207.htm)\n\n"
