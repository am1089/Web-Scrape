Since, up to the union with that (i.e. Brahman) the texts describe the Sa\n_m_ sara state.\n\nThe immortality referred to must necessarily be understood as not implying\ndissolution of the soul's connexion with the body, since up to the soul's\nattaining to Brahman the texts describe the Sa _m_ sara state. That attaining\nto Brahman takes place, as will be shown further on, after the soul--moving on\nthe path the first stage of which is light--has reached a certain place. Up to\nthat the texts denote the Sa _m_ sara state of which the connexion with a body\nis characteristic. 'For him there is delay so long as he is not delivered\n(from the body); then he will be united' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 14, 2); 'Shaking off\nall evil as a horse shakes his hairs, and as the moon frees herself from the\nmouth of Rahu; having shaken off the body I obtain self, made and satisfied,\nthe uncreated world of Brahman' (VIII, 13).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 9.
