Said the Teacher to him: "Is it really\ntrue that you have ceased all striving?_ "--" _Yes, Blessed One," he replied.\nThen the Teacher said: " O Brother, in former days wise men made effort in the\nplace where effort should be made, and so attained unto royal power." And he\ntold a story of long ago.\n\n_\n\nOnce upon a time, when Brahmadatta was King of Benares, the Bodhisatta was\nborn as son of his chief queen. On his name-day they asked 800 Brahmans,\nhaving satisfied them with all their desires, about his lucky marks. The\nBrahmans who had skill in divining from such marks beheld the excellence of\nhis, and made answer:\n\n"Full of goodness, great King, is your son, and when you die he will become\nking; he shall be famous and renowned for his skill with the five weapons, and\nshall be the chief man in all India. On hearing what the Brahmans had to say,\nthey gave him the name of the Prince of the Five Weapons, sword, spear, bow,\nbattle-axe, and shield.\n\nWhen he came to years of discretion, and had attained the measure of sixteen\nyears, the King said to him:\n\n"My son, go and complete your education."\n\n"Who shall be my teacher?" the lad asked.\n\n"Go, my son; in the kingdom of Candahar, in the city of Takkasila, is a far-\nfamed teacher from whom I wish you to learn. Take this, and give it him for a\nfee." With that he gave him a thousand pieces of money, and dismissed him.\n\nThe lad departed and was educated by this teacher; he received the Five\nWeapons from him as a gift, bade him farewell, and leaving Takkasila, he began\nhis journey to Benares, armed with the Five Weapons.\n\nOn his way he came to a forest inhabited by the Demon with the Matted Hair. At\nthe entering of the forest some men saw him, and cried out:\n\n"Hullo, young sir, keep clear of that wood! There\'s a Demon in it called he of\nthe Matted Hair: he kills every man he sees!" And they tried to stop him. But\nthe Bodhisatta, having confidence in himself, went straight on, fearless as a\nmaned lion.\n\nWhen he reached mid-forest the Demon showed himself. He made himself as tall\nas a palm-tree; his head was the size of a pagoda, his eyes as big as saucers,\nand he had two tusks all over knobs and bulbs; he had the face of a hawk, a\nvariegated belly, and blue hands and feet.\n\n"Where are you going?" he shouted. "Stop! You\'ll make a meal for me!"\n\nSaid the Bodhisatta: "Demon, I came here trusting in myself. I advise you to\nbe careful how you come near me. Here\'s a poisoned arrow, which I\'ll shoot at\nyou and knock you down!" With this menace, he fitted to his bow an arrow\ndipped in deadly poison, and let fly. The arrow stuck fast in the Demon\'s\nhair. Then he shot and shot, till he had shot away fifty arrows; and they all\nstuck in the Demon\'s hair. The Demon snapped them all off short, and threw\nthem down at his feet; then came up to the Bodhisatta, who drew his sword and\nstruck the Demon, threatening him the while. His sword--it was three-and-\nthirty inches long--stuck in the Demon\'s hair! The Bodhisatta struck him with\nhis spear--that stuck too! He struck him with his club--and that stuck too!\n\nWhen the Bodhisatta saw that this had stuck fast, he addressed the Demon.\n"You, Demon!" said he, "did you never hear of me before--the Prince of the\nFive Weapons? When I came into the forest which you live in I did not trust to\nmy bow and other weapons: This day will I pound you and grind you to powder!"\nThus did he declare his resolve, and with a shout he hit at the Demon with his\nright hand. It stuck fast in his hair! He hit him with his left hand--that\nstuck too!\' With his right foot he kicked him--that stuck too; then with his\nleft--and that stuck too! Then he butted at him with his head, crying, "I\'ll\npound you to powder! " and his head stuck fast like the rest.\n\nThus the Bodhisatta was five times snared, caught fast in five places, hanging\nsuspended: yet he felt no fear--was not even nervous.\n\nThought the Demon to himself: "Here\'s a lion of a man! A noble man! More than\nman is he! Here he is, caught by a Demon like me; yet he will not fear a bit.\nSince I have ravaged this road, I never saw such a man. Now, why is it that he\ndoes not fear?" He was powerless to eat the man, but asked him: "Why is it,\nyoung sir, that you are not frightened to death?"\n\n"Why should I fear, Demon?" replied he. "In one life a man can die but once.\nBesides, in my belly is a thunderbolt; if you eat me, you will never be able\nto digest it; this will tear your inwards into little bits, and kill you: so\nwe shall both perish. That is why I fear nothing." (By this, the Bodhisatta\nmeant the weapon of knowledge which he had within him.)\n\nWhen he heard this, the Demon thought: "This young man speaks the truth. A\npiece of the flesh of such a lion-man as he would be too much for me to\ndigest, if it were no bigger than a kidney-bean. I\'ll let him go!" So, being\nfrightened to death, he let go the Bodhisatta, saying:\n\n"Young sir, you are a lion of a man! I will not eat you up. I set you free\nfrom my hands, as the moon is disgorged from the jaws of Rahu after the\neclipse. Go back to the company of your friends and relations!"\n\nAnd the Bodhisatta said: "Demon, I will go, as you say. You were born a Demon,\ncruel, blood-bibbing, devourer of the flesh and gore of others, because you\ndid wickedly in former lives. If you still go on doing wickedly, you will go\nfrom darkness to darkness. But now that you have seen me you will find it\nimpossible to do wickedly. Taking the life of living creatures causes birth,\nas an animal, in the world of Petas, or, in the body of an Asura, or, if one\nis reborn as a man, it makes his life short." With -this and the like monition\nhe told him the disadvantage of the five kinds of wickedness, and the profit\nof the five kinds of virtue, and frightened the Demon in various ways,\ndiscoursing to him until he subdued him and made him self-denying, and\nestablished him in the five kinds of virtue; he made him worship the deity to\nwhom offerings were made in that wood; and having carefully admonished him,\ndeparted out of it.\n\nAt the entrance of the forest he told all to the people thereabout; and went\non to Benares, armed with his five weapons. Afterwards he became king, and\nruled righteously; and after giving alms and doing good he passed away\naccording to his deeds.\n\n_\n\nAnd the Teacher, when this tale was ended, became perfectly enlightened, and\nrepeated this verse:\n\nWhose mind and heart from all desire is free,  \nWho seeks for peace by living virtuously,  \nHe in due time will sever all the bonds  \nThat bind him fast to life, and cease to be.\n\nThus the Teacher reached the summit, through sainthood and the teaching of the\nlaw, and thereupon he declared the Four Truths. At the end of the declaring of\nthe Truths, this Brother also attained to sainthood. Then the Teacher made the\nconnexion, and gave the key to the birth-tale, saying: "At that time\nAngulimala was the Demon, but the, Prince of_ _the Five Weapons was I myself."\n\n_\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Ivory City and its Fairy Princess](ift27.htm)\n\n'
