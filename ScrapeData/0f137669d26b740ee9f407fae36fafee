Siva Guru! Siva Guru!  \n          _Salutation to Siva, as the Teacher of the Soul_.\n\nIN India\'s great moments, the Himalayas have always been her highway, not her\nboundary. Those strings of pack-mules, with their sorry-looking rice-bags,.\nthat we meet on every hill-path, as we wander through the mountains, are the\nremains of a great continental traffic that once carried the religion into\nChina. For beliefs, like diseases, do not travel alone. The pilgrim is\naccompanied by the pedlar: the begging-friar dogs the footsteps of the\nmerchant; the faith follows the line of trade. It may be that if Chinese silk\nand turquoise had not found their way to India many centuries before the birth\nof Buddha, the news of the Great Nirvana could never have reached the remoter\nEast.\n\nTo this day, we find ancient capitals and their ruins, old fortresses, royal\ntemples, scattered up and down the heights from Beluchistan to Nepal, in\nregions long depopulated. And Himalayan shrines and cities have an art and\narchitecture of their own, which is more severely beautiful, because more\n\np. 192\n\ndirectly related to the common early Asiatic, than the later styles, to be\nfound further south. For the first culture-area of humanity had these\nmountains as its rim. Long before a local prepossession had named the\nMediterranean, Asia was. And of that Asia, Egypt, Greece, Etruria, were\noutlying provinces. The Saracen and Moor, with all that they brought of art\nand chivalry, with all the intellectual vividness they conferred on Europe,\nwere but the relic-mongers of its past. In the West, even now, we admit a\npeople to be civilised only if we can trace its intellectual descent from this\nancient Asia.\n\nAbove all, it is the broken voices of its primitive consciousness that are\nhailed to-day in every civilised country as divine revelations. India herself\nis no exception to this rule. For all the migrations of Asokan and other\nperiods pale beside the memory of the still more significant era when for the\nfirst time there came to settle on the Northern Plain those little communities\nof people, already agricultural and industrial in their habits, who carried\nwith them the culture of Central Asia. It was not a regimented immigration.\nThe Lall Kaffir, or pale folk, dwelling to this day in the Hindu Kuch, were\nnot deserters, turning aside from the line of march. We must rather suppose a\ngradual overflow, through many centuries, of the Himalayan region. And yet, at\nsome time or place, it must have been sufficiently consolidated and self-\norganised to become conscious of its great heritage of thought, to commit its\nknowledge to writing, and to give form and definition to the Aryan\ncivilisation.\n\nWherever and whenever it may have happened, this was the moment at which long\nages of accumulating reflection and observation precipitated themselves into\nform as the Vedas. Even so are all Scriptures born. The Tartar herdsman,\nfacing his\n\np. 193\n\nunknown future as a peasant, records at once his ideals and his memories, and\nwe have the Eki, or Book of Change, of the Chinese people. The austere self-\nisolation of a few tribes of Syrian shepherds fronts with terror the\ndegradation of Babylonian cities, and the prophets pour out their sublime\nwoes. The Latin Church carries to the Norse peasant with one hand the waters\nof baptism, with the other the script, by means of which he is to write down\nhis magnificent sagas. The old order blossoms into complete self-consciousness\nat that very instant when every petal trembles to the fall.\n\nSo passed the Vedic age, for the Aryans settled down in India, and became\nHindus. The process by which this was accomplished must have been complex and\ngradual. In some directions towards a greater luxury, it must have been\nfundamentally a simplification of life. The builders of the Himalayas had used\nwood and stone. The builders of the plains used bamboos, mud, and bricks; and\ntheir architectural designs began to approximate to those of pottery. The\nweavers of Central Asia had worked in wool, doubtless of marvellous dyes. The\ncraftsmen of the South were driven to cotton and silk. That system of ritual\npurification which was common to the whole of the Asiatic culture, and which\nis still retained by Europe in the form of sacraments and rubrics, must have\nbeen deepened and extended to meet the new climatic conditions. Natural\nmetaphor underwent transformation. Coolness was exchanged for warmth as the\nqualification of friendship. Himalayan scenery was no longer present to give\nconstant birth to grand myths and colossal imaginary. That gradual absorption\nof regional thought and worship began, which was to produce what in its latest\nphase would be known as Hinduism. But it was always to be absorption. It was\nalways to be the play of the Aryan intellect\n\np. 194\n\nupon the indigenous symbol; never the acceptance of a superstition that could\nnot be rationalised. This wonderful continuity of thinking marks the\nsolidarity of Hinduism as nothing else could. Every creed within its frontiers\n--and they are wide enough to include all types of religious thought--can\nprove the Vedas to be its authority. Even the image of the Goddess Kali is\nheld to be foreshadowed in the sublime Anthem to Creation of the Rig-Veda:\n\nThe Self sustained as Cause below,  \nProjected as Effect above.\n\nWe find in India, then, a classical nation like Egypt or Greece, which has\nbeen allowed to develop freely on the mental plane, and has held the thread of\nits thought unbroken to the present day. It may be said broadly that great\nculture and subjective philosophies are almost always continental in their\norigin, while the sense of nationality and insistence on the beautiful are\ninsular. If this be true, it would explain the greater sympathy between\nHellenic and Japanese developments than between Greek and Indian.\n\nFor the Hindu imagination long ago detached itself from the cycle of physical\nbeauty, to seek its fullest satisfaction in subtler realms. This fact is\nextraordinarily evident in Kalidas\' poem of "The birth of the War-Lord," where\nhe depicts the wooing of Mahadev by Uma, the Himalayan princess. Here the poet\nplaces his heroine at the very acme of maidenly charm, kneeling in worship to\nlay flowers at the feet of the Great God, and having as her background the\nforest of plum and cherry and almond, all suddenly burst into blossom, because\nto them comes Spring, as the comrade of Love. And then, with a single sweep of\nthe brush, the picture is blotted out: the Great God has vanished from beneath\nhis cedar; Eros is burnt to ashes; and the\n\np. 195\n\nroyal maiden kneels alone, while the bitter wailing of Desire, the beautiful\nwife of Love, fills the whole woodland. Uma\'s triumph is reached, and the\nDivine Spouse drawn to her side, only when, in the midst of unheard-of\nausterities, she gives supreme proof of courage and devotion as nun and\nworshipper instead of woman and lover. This touch lies far beyond the range of\nthe Greek.\n\nA similar tendency to use physical symbolism as a system of notation merely,\ninstead of seeking in it the direct and adequate expression of spiritual\nconceptions, as did the classical genius of Europe, is to be found throughout\nthe whole conception of Siva or Mahadev, the Great God Himself. The tiger-skin\nin which he is clad, and some of the names of this deity, induce Tod in his\n"Annals of Rajasthan" to regard him as simply a new version of the Greek\nBacchus. It is a great deal more likely that behind the two, in the dim North,\nand in the distant past--in some Lake Manasarovar of thought, to quote Max\nMuller--there may loom up a common ancestor. But this probability only makes\nmore significant the divergences between the two conceptions.\n\nAny one who visits Northern India must desire to know the meaning of the\nlittle black stones under every conspicuous tree, which are so evidently set\nup for worship. They are said by Europeans to be of phallic origin; but if so,\nHindus are no more conscious of the fact than we of the similar origin of the\nmaypole. Wherever one goes, one finds them, by the roadsides in cities and\nvillages, on the river-banks, or inside the entrance to a garden, it there is\na tree that stands alone. For in such places one is glad to think that the\nGreat God, begging His handful of rice from door to door, may have seated\nHimself to bless us with His meditation.\n\nThe small stone pillar, called the lingam--the\n\np. 196\n\nword _lingam_ is literally _symbol_ \\--may have been taken from the bed of a\nstream, and in that case is likely to be of a long egg-shape. But if it has\nbeen cut by the hand of man, it is short and slightly tapering, with a\nthimble-like top. Sometimes, in all good faith, the features of a human face\nhave been more or less crudely marked on it, with white paint. In any case, it\nis only a question of time till some woman, passing by on her way from\nbathing, stops to pour a little water, or sprinkle a few grains of rice\ntenderly over the head of the stone, perhaps also to add bel-leaves,\ntrifoliate like our clover; or a garland of white flowers; or, prompted by a\nheart more devoted and loving than usual, to touch it with a spot of sandal-\npaste, so cool and refreshing in this hot climate! Then the earth is touched\nwith the head, and the worshipper passes on.\n\nThe simple act is not without its perplexities, and we seek for\ninterpretation. At first in vain. Or the explanations given are more\nbewildering than helpful. Hindus are too conscious of the symbolistic nature\nof every faith, and too sensitive also to the scornful irreverence of most\nforeign inquirers, to speak out, or argue out, the heart of their heart with\nthe passing stranger. Rather they will turn on one, with a strange pity. "Do\nyou not understand," they will say, "that this is the Great God who is\nemblemed here? He can have neither visitor, nor history, nor worshipper. Such\nthings are vain dreams of men. Only for our own hearts\' ease, and to carry\nourselves nearer to the inner vision, do we set up a stone whereon we may\noffer rice and water and lay a leaf or two!" It will be difficult in all India\nto find a woman so simple, or a peasant so ignorant, that to them worship is\nnot, as some one has said, "a conscious symbolism, instead of a fragment of\nprimitive personification." Yet by degrees\n\np. 197\n\nthe great myth leaks out. Little by little we learn the associations of the\nname.\n\nThe lingam, after all, is but a fragment of stone. Far better images of\nMahadev are those who come and go yonder, amidst the passing crowd--the monks\nand beggars, some clad only in ashes with matted hair, others with shaven\nhead, and clothed from throat to foot in the sacred yellow, but most of them\nbearing one form or another of staff or trident, and carrying a begging bowl.\nAnd finer still will these be, when, retiring into the forest, or climbing to\nthe verge of eternal snows, they sit, even like this stone lingam, bolt\nupright in the shelter of tree or rock, lost to the world without, in solitary\nmeditation.\n\nAbout the whole conception there is a striking reminiscence of the Himalayas.\nWhether we will or not we are carried back, as we listen, to the great age of\nthe Vedas, when the Aryan immigration was still taking place. It is a day of\nsacrifice, and at the forest-clearing people and priests are met, to heap the\nofferings on the mighty fire, chanting appropriate texts. Hour after hour,\nsometimes day after day, the mound of pure flame lasts, and long after it has\nceased the hot white ashes lie in their immense bed, thrilling now and then to\na faint trickling spark, sighing themselves out into the coldness of death.\nWho was it that first came and rubbed himself with those soft white ashes, in\norder to be clothed upon with the worship of God and separation from the\nworld? Who was it that first retired into cave or jungle, and meditated, until\nhis hair became a tangled mass, and his nails grew long, and his body\nemaciated, and he still pursued the sublime bliss of the soul? However the\nidea of such an exterior grew, the whole genius of India has spoken for many a\ncentury in just such a picture--the hermit clad in wood-ashes, with masses of\nneglected hair,\n\np. 198\n\npiled on the top of his head, indifferent to the whole world, bent only on\nthought.\n\nAs the Aryans wandered in sight of the snow-mountains, with the fire-sacrifice\nfor their central rite, an indissoluble connection arose in their minds\nbetween the two ideas. Were not the flames of the offerings white like the\nHimalayas, always mounting upward like the aspiring peaks, leaving behind them\nashes for eternal frost? Those snowy heights, we must suppose, became the\ncentral objects of their love. Lifted above the world in silence, terrible in\ntheir cold and their distance, yet beautiful beyond all words, what are they\nlike? Why, they are like--a great monk, clothed in ashes, lost in his\nmeditation, silent and alone! They are like--like--the Great God Himself,\nSiva, Mahadev!\n\nHaving arrived at this thought, the Hindu mind began to work out all sorts of\naccessories and symbols, in which sometimes the idea of flame, sometimes of\nmountain, sometimes of hermit is uppermost--all contributing to the completed\npicture of Siva, the Great God.\n\nThe wood was borne to the sacrifice on a bull: Siva possesses an old bull, on\nwhich he rides.\n\nAs the moon shines above the mountains, so He bears on His forehead the new\nmoon.\n\nLike the true ascetic, begging food at the householder\'s door, He is pleased\nwith very simple gifts. The cold water of the bath, a few grains of rice, and\ntwo or three green bel-leaves, are His whole offering in the daily worship.\nBut the rice and water must be of the purest, for they are presented to a most\nhonoured guest. Evidently the bel-leaf, like the shamrock, refers to the\nTrinity. For, as we all know, this doctrine is Hindu as well as Christian and\nEgyptian.\n\nTo show how easily Siva can be pleased, the people tell a pretty story. A poor\nhuntsman--that is to\n\np. 199\n\nsay, one of the lowest of the low--once came to the end of a day\'s hunting\nwithout having snared or killed a single creature. Night came on, and he was\nfar from home, in the jungle, alone. Near by stood a bel-tree, with branches\nnear the ground, and he was glad to climb into it, to pass the night in\nshelter from wild beasts. But as he lay crouching in its branches, the thought\nof his wife and children starving at home would come to him, and for pity of\ntheir need great tears rolled down his cheeks, and falling on the bel-leaves\nbroke them by their weight, and carried them to the ground. Under the sacred\ntree, however, stood a Siva-lingam, image of Siva, and the tears fell, with\nthe leaves, on its head. That night a black snake crept up the tree, and stung\nthe man. And bright spirits came, and carried his soul to Heaven, and laid it\ndown at the feet of Siva.\n\nThen, in that holy place, rose the clamour of many voices questioning: "Why is\nthis savage here? Has he not eaten impure foods? Has he offered right\nsacrifices? Has he known the law?" But the Great God turned on them all in\ngentle surprise: "Did he not worship Me with bel-leaves and with tears?" He\nsaid.\n\nLooking closer at the _flame_ , however, one thing was very clear. It was\nwhite, but it had a blue throat--we see it even when we light a match!--and in\norder to bestow a blue throat upon Siva, the following story arose:\n\nOnce upon a time, all the splendour and glory of the gods seemed to be\nvanishing from them. (Are such tales, we wonder, a reminiscence of the period\nwhen the old gods, Indra, Agni, and the lords of the universe, found\nthemselves growing unfashionable, because the Trinity, Brahma--Vishnu--Siva,\nwas coming into favour?) What to do, the gods did not know, but they\ndetermined to pray to Vishnu, the\n\np. 200\n\n[paragraph continues] Preserver of the World, for advice. He told them,\nperhaps contemptuously, to "go and churn the ocean!" and the poor gods trooped\nforth eagerly to do his bidding.\n\nThey churned and churned. Many great and splendid things came foaming up, and\nthey seized them with avidity, here a wonderful elephant, there a princely\nhorse, again a beautiful wife for some one. Each was only greedy to be first\nin the handling of the next delight, when all at once something black began to\ncome. Welling up and up, and then spreading over the whole ocean, it came.\n"What is it?" they asked each other in horror. It was poison--death to them,\ndeath to the world, death to the universe. It came to their very feet, and\nthey had to retreat rapidly in fear. Already they were in the midst of\ndarkness, and there was nowhere that they could flee, for this dense blackness\nwas about to cover all the worlds. In this moment of mortal terror, all the\ngods with one voice called on Siva. He had taken no part in the receiving of\ngifts, maybe He would be able to help them now. Instantly, the great White God\nwas in their midst. He smiled gently at their dilemma and their fear, and\nstooping down He put His hand into the waves, and bade the poison flow into\nthe hollow of His palm. Then He drank it, willing to die, in order to save the\nworld. But that which would have been enough to destroy all created beings was\nonly enough to stain His throat, hence He bears there a patch of blue for\never.\n\nPerhaps one of the most characteristic myths that have clustered round the\nname of Mahadev is the Legend of the Boar-Hunt. As we read it, we stand pan\nthe snowy heights of the third range of the Himalayas, and seem to watch a\nmighty snow-storm sweeping through the ravine before us.\n\nArjuna, one of the principal heroes of the Great\n\np. 201\n\n[paragraph continues] War, and the second figure in the dialogue of the Gita,\nhad gone up into the mountains, to spend three months in worshipping Siva, and\ninvoking His blessing. Suddenly one day as he was praying and offering flowers\nbefore the lingam, he was roused by a wild boar, which was rushing forward to\nattack him. It was only an instant, and Arjuna, the practised archer, had\nseized his bow and shot the animal. But at the self same moment a shout of\nwarning was heard, and simultaneously with Arjuna\'s a second arrow pierced the\nbody of the beast. The hero raised his eyes, and saw, coming towards him, a\nformidable-looking hunter and huntress, followed by an innumerable retinue of\nwomen, attired for the chase, and attended, at some distance, by a dim host of\nshadows--the armies of demons and hobgoblins. A second later, the whole hunt\nhad come to a stop before him.\n\n"The quarry was mine!" cried the Hunter--and his voice sounded like the\nwinter-blasts, amongst the mountains--"the quarry was mine. Mine is the\nlordship of these forests! How dared you touch it?"\n\nAt this address, Arjuna blazed with anger, and picking up the bow and arrows\nthat he had thrown aside before returning to his worship, he challenged the\nHunter to a personal combat.\n\n"Accepted," was the reply, and the duel began. But to the hero\'s dismay, he\nseemed to be attacking some terrible phantom, for, one after another, his good\nstout arrows disappeared into the person of his antagonist, working him no\nharm.\n\n"Let\'s wrestle then!" shouted Arjuna, and casting aside his how, he flung\nhimself upon his foe. He was met by the quiet touch of a hand on his heart,\nand fell to the ground stunned.\n\n"Well, come on!" said the Hunter, as he recovered himself a few seconds later,\nand turned aside from\n\np. 202\n\nthe contest. But he seemed almost intoxicated. "I must finish my worship\nfirst," he said, in a thick voice, taking up a garland of flowers, to fling\nabout the Siva-lingam. The next moment the eyes of Arjuna were opened, for the\nHunter towered above him, blessing him, and the flowers were about his neck.\n\n"Mahadev! Mahadev!" cried the worshipper, Ringing himself on the ground, to\ntouch with his head the feet of the God. But already the hunt had swept on\ndown the valley, and the Hunter and Huntress had disappeared, with all their\ntrain.\n\n\n\nSuch are a few of the stories told of Siva, so deeply loved by all his\ndevotees. To them there is nothing in the world so strong and pure and all-\nmerciful as their great God, and the books and poems of Hindus are very few in\nwhich he is not referred to with this passionate worship.\n\nSometimes He is entirely a personification of the Himalayas, as when the Milky\nWay is made to fall upon his head, wander round and round amongst the tangled\nlocks, and issue from them at last as the Ganges. Indeed, the imagination of\nthe people may be said to make of their northern ranges one vast shrine to\nHim; for it is far away, they say, across the frost-bound heights, where the\nHimalayas are at their mightiest and India passes into Thibet, that the Lake\nManasarovar lies, at the foot of the great ice-peak of Kailash. Here is the\nreign of silence and eternal snow, and here, guarding the north, is the holy\nhome that Siva loves.\n\nHe is the very soul of gentleness, refusing none. Up here have gathered round\nHim all those who were weary of earth, having found no acceptance amongst the\nfortunate. The serpents, whom all the world hates and denies, come to Kailash,\nand\n\np. 203\n\n[paragraph continues] Mahadev finds room for them in His great heart. And the\ntired beasts come--for He is the refuge of animals--and it is one of these, a\nshabby old bull, that He specially loves and rides upon.\n\nAnd here, too, come the spirits of all those men and women who are turbulent\nand troublesome and queer, the bad boys and girls of the grown-up world, as it\nwere. All the people who are so ugly that no one wants to see them; those who\ndo things clumsily, and talk loudly, and upset everything, though they mean no\nharm, and the poor things who are ridden by one idea, so that they never can\nsee straight, but always seem a little mad--such are the souls on whom He\nalone has mercy. He is surrounded by them, and they love and worship Him. He\nuses them to do His errands, and they are known as Siva\'s demons.\n\nBut Siva is more even than this. He is the Self-born, the eternally-existent\npostulate of freedom and purity and light. He is the great teaching soul of\nthings. His function is to destroy ignorance, and wherever knowledge is\nachieved, He is. His name of "Hara! Hara!" ("The Free! The Free!") was. the\nbattle-cry of the Mahrattas. More yet, He is Rudra, the Storm, the Terrible;\nand it is under this aspect that Hinduism raises to Him its daily cry:\n\nEvermore protect us,--O thou terrible!--  \nFrom ignorance, by thy sweet compassionate face.\n\n[paragraph continues] For, after all, a human quality is always limited to one\nof two, the Divine must be lifted above good as well as evil, above joy as\nwell as pain. We have here the Indian conception of same-sightedness, and\nperhaps its devotional significance is nowhere interpreted as in the Hindi\nsong of Surdas, which is here repeated as a nautch-girl was heard to sing it\nin a Rajput Court:\n\np. 204\n\nO Lord, look not upon my evil qualities!  \nThy name, O Lord, is Same-sightedness,  \nBy Thy touch, if Thou wilt, Thou canst make me pure. *\n\nOne drop of water is in the sacred Jumna,  \nAnother is foul in the ditch by the roadside,  \nBut when they fall into the Ganges,  \nBoth alike become holy.\n\nOne piece of iron is the image in the temple,  \nAnother is the knife in the hand of the butcher,  \nBut when they touch the philosopher\'s stone,  \nBoth alike turn to gold.\n\nSo, Lord, look not upon my evil qualities!  \nThy name, O Lord, is Same-sightedness,  \nMake us both the same Brahman.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[204:*](wil14.htm#fr_35) Literally, Make us both the same Brahman-- _i.e._ ,\nLet the Singer--low dancing-girl as she may be--become one with God Himself in\nthe Supreme Essence, Brahman. The theological conception here is so difficult\nfor Western readers that I have preferred to use the simpler alternative\ntranslation also furnished by my Master, the Swami Vivekananda.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XIII.
