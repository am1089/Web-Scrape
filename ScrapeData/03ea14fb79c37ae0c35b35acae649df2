By a memory of these early senses, by the faint remnant of\nthem that the long ages in their passage have left us, we can hear now the\nfaint stirring of the opening buds of a new spring of intellectual life, a new\nperiod in the spiritual thought of the world; and the key-note of this new\nperiod is the East, the wisdom of the East, the thought and ideals of the\nEast.\n\nNot merely or necessarily the East in latitude, but rather the Eastern side of\nman--that East in the soul of every man where the sun rises, where the light\nof intuition opens its first dawning rays, and, "rising, guides the lesser\nlives among its rays." And yet the East in latitude gives the key-note to the\nnew dawn of thought in a special sense too. For it was in the East, and, more\nthan all, in India, "mother of nations, that the eastern part of man where the\nsun rises found its best development; that the interior light of the soul\nfound its fullest recognition.\n\nAnd it is only natural that the minds of men, feeling the first gleam of\ndawning day, should turn towards the East; that they should grow enthusiastic\nfor the Lands of the East, and, more than all, for India: that India should\noccupy an ever-widening space on the horizon of their thoughts; that their\nhearts should more and more turn towards India.\n\np. 94\n\nThis growing interest and enthusiasm for India--an enthusiasm at first almost\ninstinctive, but gradually quickened by advancing knowledge--is especially\nfelt today in the two most idealistic nations in the West, the Americans and\nthe Germans. For with all their sense of practical life and practical\ndevelopment, the Americans and Germans are at heart idealists; ready to\nsacrifice all their practical aims and practical accomplishment to a vision;\nready, as Emerson said, to leave Cleopatra and the army, to seek the sources\nof the Nile.\n\nThe deepest curiosity of the Americans and Germans, turning towards India,\nunquestionably centers on the Brahmans; one bears again and again the words--\nthe wisdom of the Brahmans, the ideal of the Brahmans, the life of the\nBrahmans; and the first question one is always asked refers to the Brahman\norder. To answer this question, it would be necessary to write many volumes;\nto trace the rise of the Brahman order in the dim twilight of Vedic days; to\nshow the growth and consolidation of their power in the days of Rama, and\nthrough the struggles of the great war of the P\xc3\x82\xe1\xb9\x86\xe1\xb8\x8cU and KURU princes; to point\nto certain dark sides of their development that had become visible in Buddha\'s\ndays; and at last to fill in the splendid picture of Brahmanic advance and\nBrahmanic development in \xc5\x9aankaracharya\'s days.\n\nWhen the records of the monasteries of Southern India are more fully known and\nunderstood, when the Smarta Brahmans who have preserved most clearly the\nsplendid tradition of \xc5\x9aankara relax a little their reserve,\n\np. 95\n\nwe shall--it can hardly be doubted--have a picture of that great man and his\ntimes as perfect and full of color as the picture we have of Plato\'s times,\nand the thought of Plato who, more than any other philosopher, resembles\n\xc5\x9aankara.\n\nWhat we know of \xc5\x9aankara already, though only a tithe of what we may know when\nold records are opened, is enough to give him a place amongst the choicest\nspiritual aristocracy of the world, as a seer and thinker who towered above\nhis race as Plato towered above the Greeks; as a Great Man, an elder brother\nof the race, whose thought and insight mark a high tide of human life.\n\nThere is a dim tradition, in the oldest Indian books, in the great Upanishads,\nand the earlier Vedic hymns, that the Brahmans were not in the beginning the\nspiritual teachers of India; that they received their earliest wisdom from the\nRoyal Sages of the Rajanya or Kshattriya race. But the Brahmans have so long\nheld these treasures of wisdom as their own--guarding them as a mother her\nchild, as a man his first-born--that they have come to consider them as their\nvery own; their heritage rather by birth than by adoption. The fact that, in\nspite of this jealous love of their darling treasures, they have preserved the\ntradition of their earliest Royal Teachers, points to the most valued feature\nin the Brahmans\' character;--the unflinching, unalterable fidelity with which\nthey have preserved, unaltered and inviolate, the spiritual treasures\ncommitted to their care; and the safe-guarding of which through the ages forms\ntheir truest and greatest title of fame;\n\np. 96\n\nthe best justification for that instinctive turning towards the Brahmans as\nthe center and representative of Indian genius, which we have noted as so\nmarked a feature of the Indian Renaissance today.\n\nBut once the Brahmans had received the wisdom-doctrines from their Royal\nTeachers, their distinctive genius, their most valued quality, began to assert\nitself. With their unparalleled genius for order, their instinctive feeling\nfor preservation, they recorded, classified and developed the intuitive wisdom\nof the Royal Sages--Buddha, a Royal Sage of far later days, has put on record\nthis unparalleled fidelity: "those ancient Rishis of the Brahmans, versed in\nthe Three Wisdoms, the authors of the verses, the utterers of the verses,\nwhose ancient form of words so chanted, uttered, or composed, the Brahmans of\ntoday chant over again and repeat; intoning or reciting, exactly as has been\nintoned or recited."--( _Tevigga Sutta_ ).\n\nThat Krishna, the spiritual hero of the Mahabharata war, whose mission it was\nto usher in the Iron Age of Kali Yuga, was no Brahman but a Kshattriya, who\ntraced his doctrines from Manu the Kshattriya through the Royal Sages, is\nenough to show that in the days of the great war, the Brahmans had not yet\nclaimed as quite their own the teachings of wisdom which it was their mission\nto hand down through the ages. ( _Bhagavad-G ita_, iv).\n\nThe great war, according to Indian tradition, was fought out five thousand\nyears ago. And, after the great war, in which so many Kshattriya princes fell,\nthe keeping of the Sacred records began to pass completely\n\np. 97\n\ninto the hands of the Brahmans. The Brahmans, sensible of their great mission,\nprepared themselves to carry it out by forming a high ideal of life; by strict\nrules of conduct and discipline which only the highest characters could\nsupport; and the very strictness of which seems to have produced a reaction\nwhich we see traces of in Buddha\'s days.\n\nThe life of the Brahman was conceived and moulded in accordance with his high\nideal; in accordance with his high destiny as transmitter of the wisdom of the\nGolden Age across the centuries to our dark iron days. Purity, unworldliness,\nand discipline were the key-notes of his life; and the Brahman\'s unparalleled\ngenius for order gradually moulded this ideal into a set of definite rules, a\nseries of religious ceremonies, which laid hold on his life before he saw the\nlight of day, and did not loose that hold when his body vanished among the red\nembers of the funeral pyre--but rather kept in touch with him, through the\n\xc5\x9araddha offering to the shades for nine generations after his death.\n\nThis life of ceremonies and rites, the key-note of which was the acquiring and\ntransmission of the Three Wisdoms spoken of by Buddha, gradually made of the\nBrahman order a treasure-box or casket for the safer keeping of the holy\nrecords handed down. Whether the Brahmans were originally of the fair, almost\nwhite race which forms their nucleus today, and whose distinctive physical\ncharacter and color make a Brahman of pure type at once recognizable in an\nassemblage of Hindus, is a question difficult to solve. We find in the oldest\nIndian books that: "The color of the Brahman\n\np. 98\n\nis white," and this, in later days became a sentence symbolical of their ideal\nof purity; but in the beginning it may have been a description of their color,\nan index of their race.\n\nIt is very probable that this fair, almost white race, which now forms the\nnucleus of the Brahman order, gradually became, through selective genius,\nthrough their unequalled instinct of order, the recognized repository and\ntransmitter of the sacred records of the past. But the ideal life of the\nBrahman was, perhaps, too arduous for the common lot of man; at any rate we\nsee a gradually increasing tendency to degeneration in one side of the\nBrahman\'s life; for in India as in other lands, even silver clouds have their\ndark linings.\n\nTheir instinct for order, among the Brahmans of lesser moral structure than\nthe high ideal of their race, became an instinct for ceremonial; their ideal\nof purity became a habit of outward purification; and they tended to harden\ninto an exclusive priestly caste, with drawn from, and above the common life\nof man. The priestcraft, by a second step, began to weave ambitions, to seek a\nshare of political power, and at last, a practical predominance in the state,\nwhich threatened to become a spiritual tyranny.\n\nBut these developments, inseparable from the weakness of human life, were but\nthe rusting of the outer layer of the casket in which the wisdom of the Golden\nAge was handed down. There were also within the Brahman order--as there are\ntoday--men who held to the high ideal of their past; who were fitting\nrepositories of the high tradition they were destined to\n\np. 99\n\ncarry down. The casket in which were held the records of the past had always\nits lining of precious metal, though the outside might rust and tarnish with\nthe passing ages.\n\nThe greatest of these followers of that high idea, in later days, within the\nBrahman caste, was \xc5\x9aankaracharya, the Brahman Sage of Southern India. It is\nhard to say, with certainty, when \xc5\x9aankara lived; but the records of \xc5\x9aringiri,\nwhere his successors have held rule over the nucleus of the Brahman order,\npoint to a period about two millenniums ago; a period, that is, just outside\nthe threshold of our era.\n\n\xc5\x9aankaracharya began the work of reforming the Brahman caste from within. A few\ncenturies before him, Buddha had scattered broadcast through India, and\nBuddha\'s followers had scattered broadcast through the world, the teachings of\nIndia\'s Golden Days, in a form readily intelligible for all, and to be\nassimilated by the simplest mind of man.\n\nIt remained to do for India, what, perhaps, others were doing, across the\nHimalayas, for the whole world; to preserve inviolate, and transmit in its\npurity that other side of wisdom which the simplest heart of man can\nintuitively feel; but which only the most perfectly developed powers, the most\nfully expanded intellect and spiritual insight can fully and consciously\ngrasp; it remained to secure the preservation of those profounder truths and\nthat deeper knowledge which only the finest powers of the soul can adequately\ncomprehend.\n\nTo secure their preservation in India was the duty\n\np. 100\n\nand mission of \xc5\x9aankaracharya. Believing that this preservation should be\nhelped and seconded by whatever aids selective race genius and hereditary\ncapacity could give, he confined the transmission of this wisdom, and of the\nrecords which contained it, entirely within the Brahman order, as far as our\nknowledge goes. There is evidence that, among the Brahmans of Southern India\nin early days, were a certain number of families not belonging to that white\nrace which forms the nucleus of the Brahman caste; but belonging to the dark,\nalmost black Dravidian peoples of Southern India, who are the survivors,\nperhaps, of a land that once lay to the south of India, but has now vanished\nbeneath the waves. This dark Dravidian race has produced many men of\nremarkable genius and power, whose insight and force quite fitted them for\ninclusion in the Brahman order.\n\nBut as the centuries moved on, such admission became more difficult; till, in\nthe days of \xc5\x9aankara, it is probable that the door was completely closed. What\nchanges \xc5\x9aankara made in the Brahman order which followed him, in the division\nof the Brahmans which recognized his transcendent force, can only be known\nwith surety to the Brahmans of that order themselves. But this much we know,\nthat \xc5\x9aankara did all his overpowering genius could accomplish to turn the\nBrahmans from too exclusive following after ceremonial; to lead them back to\nthe spiritual wisdom, the recognition of the inner light of the soul, which\nwas India\'s greatest heritage; and that, taking India\'s most precious records,\nthe Great Upanishads, he rendered them into the thought\n\np. 101\n\nand language of his own day, and did all that a marvelous insight and a\nliterary style of wonderful lucidity could do to make the spirit and the\ngenius of the Upanishads live once more in the hearts of the Brahmans of his\ntime.\n\nHe set himself, above all, to cleanse the inner lining of the casket where\nIndia\'s treasures lay concealed; to remove every speck from the precious metal\nwhose perfect purity alone could guarantee the costly contents against rust\nand moth. The reforms inaugurated by \xc5\x9aankaracharya continue to bear fruit\ntoday; the new light he shed on the old records, the new insight he gave to\nthe old symbols, are the treasured inheritance of the Smarta Brahmans, whose\nspiritual heads, in unbroken succession, have ruled at \xc5\x9aringiri Math, in the\nmountains of Northern India.\n\nCenturies passed, and the sunlit plains of India were filled with Moslem\ninvaders, falling like swarms of locusts on the rich gardens of that distant\nwonderland; full of the fierce hostility of fanaticism against the symbols of\na religion they did not understand; and against the Brahmans, as ministers of\nthis religion. It would not be wonderful, it would rather be perfectly\nnatural, if this hostility and predominance of a foreign fanatical power had\nsealed the lips of the Brahmans once for all as to the mysteries of their\nreligion; had locked and double-locked the casket in which the heritage of\nIndia lay concealed.\n\nBut in spite of tyranny and fanaticism that would have justified the most\nperfect reticence, the most absolute silence, the Brahmans retained an ideal\nof their\n\np. 102\n\nuniversal mission, above and beyond their mission to their own land and their\nown religion. No sooner did brighter days dawn for them under the Emperor\nAkbar, the great Indian monarch of the sixteenth century who conceived and\nframed a high ideal of religious tolerance and mutual understanding which was\nthe nearest approach to State Theosophy; no sooner did the brighter day dawn\nthan the Brahmans were ready to forget old griefs and to teach their Moslem\nrulers the broad principles of their religion.\n\nTwo generations after Akbar, Akbar\'s noblest and most ill-fated descendant,\nPrince Dara Shukoh, received from the Brahmans the permission to translate\ninto Persian a series of the Upanishads, including the Great Upanishads of\nwhich something has been already said. This Persian translation, besides\nfollowing the words of the old records, put into visible form much that had\nbeen hidden between the lines, and followed, in some degree, the new light\nthat had been shed on the Upanishads by the genius of \xc5\x9aankaracharya.\n\nThis Persian translation of the Upanishads, which embodies a very valuable\ntradition of their hidden meaning, made about the year 1640, was found by\nAnquetil Duperron in 1775, and by him translated into Latin. From Anquetil\nDuperron this "Key to the Indian Sanctuary" passed to Schopenhauer, and\nbecoming "the comfort of his life, the comfort of his death" led him to\nprophesy that Indian Renaissance which is glowing with the fair colors of dawn\ntoday.\n\nBut under Dara Shukoh\'s brother, the fanatical Aurungzeb, darker days fell\nupon the Brahmans; and\n\np. 103\n\nthey suffered much from European nations more presumptuous and not less\nfanatical than Aurungzeb; of these the darkest record clings to the\nPortuguese, who tried to wring from the Brahmans the heart of their mystery by\nInquisition and _auto-da-f e_.\n\nYet, once more, just a hundred years ago when a group of Europeans full of\nlove for the East, sought from the Brahmans some knowledge of their learning,\nthe Brahmans, with singular generosity, made these Europeans in some degree\nsharers in their heritage. From the knowledge thus freely given to these\nEuropeans, whose chiefs were William Jones and Thomas Colebrooke, the first\nfoundations of Orientalism were laid; and a field of matchless fertility was\nopened to a growing band of workers who enrolled themselves under the banner\nof the East.\n\nBut the last and finest insight, the master-key to the records was still\ntreasured in the East itself; somewhat of that insight has since been freely\noffered to us; on our ability to use it most probably depends the further\ninsight that the future holds in promise.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Awakening to the Self](cjw16.htm)\n\n'
