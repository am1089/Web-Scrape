By means of the Sura-liquor Namu _k_ i, the Asura, carried off\nIndra\'s (source of) strength, the essence of food, the Soma-drink. He (Indra)\nhasted up to the A _s_ vins and Sarasvati, crying, \'I have sworn to Namu _k_\ni, saying, "I will slay thee neither by day nor by night, neither with staff\nnor with bow, neither with the palm of my hand nor with the fist, neither with\nthe dry nor with the moist!" and yet has he taken these things from me: seek\nye to bring me back these things!\'\n\n12:7:3:22\\. They spake, \'Let us have a share therein, and we will bring them\nback to thee.\'--\'These things\n\np. 223\n\n[paragraph continues] (shall be) in common to us,\' he said, \'bring them back,\nthen!\'\n\n12:7:3:33\\. The A _s_ vins and Sarasvati then poured out foam of water (to\nserve) as a thunderbolt, saying, \'It is neither dry nor moist;\' and, when the\nnight was clearing up, and the sun had not yet risen, Indra, thinking, \'It is\nneither by day nor by night,\' therewith struck off the head of Namu _k_ i, the\nAsura.\n\n12:7:3:44\\. Wherefore it has been said by the _Ri_ shi ( _Ri_ g-veda S. VIII,\n14, 13), \'With foam of water, Indra, didst thou sever the head of Namu _k_ i,\nwhen thou wert subduing all thine enemies.\' Now, Namu _k_ i is evil: having\nthus, indeed, slain that evil, his hateful enemy, Indra wrested from him his\nenergy, or vital power. Let him who has an enemy perform the Sautrama _n_ i:\nhe thereby slays that evil, his hateful enemy, and wrests from him his energy,\nor vital power. In his (Namu _k_ i\'s) severed head there was the Soma juice\nmixed with blood. They loathed it. They perceived that (means of) drinking\nseparately (one of) the two liquids,--\'King Soma, the drink of immortality, is\npressed 1;\'--and having thereby made that (Soma) palatable, they took it in\n(as food).\n\n12:7:3:55\\. With (Va _g_. S. XIX, 1), \'Thee, the sweet (liquor I mix) with the\nsweet (Soma),\' he compounds (the ingredients for the preparation of) the Sura-\nliquor 2, and makes it palatable;--\'the strong\n\np. 224\n\nwith the strong,\' he thereby bestows energy on him (the Sacrificer);--\'the\nimmortal with the immortal,\' he thereby bestows life on him \'the honeyed with\nthe honeyed,\' he thereby bestows flavour to it (the liquor);--\'I mix with the\nSoma,\' he thereby makes it (the Sura-liquor) a form of Soma.\n\n12:7:3:66\\. \'Thou art Soma: get thee matured for the A _s_ vins! get thee\nmatured for Sarasvati! get thee matured for Indra Sutraman!\' for these were\nthe deities who first prepared that sacrifice, and with their help he now\nprepares it; and, moreover, he thereby provides these deities with their\nshare. He distils it with a view to (its being like) the Soma-pressing. For\nthree nights it remains standing, for the Soma remains standing for three\nnights after it has been bought: he thus makes it a form of Soma.\n\np. 225\n\n12:7:3:77\\. There are two Vedis 1 (altar-grounds),--\'Two worlds in truth there\nare,\' they say, \'the world of the gods, and the world of the Fathers.\' One (of\nthe Vedis) is in the north, and the other in the south, for the world of the\ngods is in the north, and the world of the Fathers in the south; by the\nnorthern one he secures the world of the gods, by the southern one the world\nof the Fathers.\n\n12:7:3:88\\. There are both milk and Sura-liquor; for milk is Soma, and the\nSura-liquor food: through the milk he secures the Soma-drink, and through the\nSura-liquor food. And milk is the nobility (chieftaincy), and Sura-liquor the\npeasantry (clan); the milk he purifies after purifying the Sura-liquor: he\nthus produces the nobility from out of the peasantry, for the nobility is\nproduced from out of the peasantry.\n\n12:7:3:99\\. With (Va _g_. S. XIX, 3), \'Purified by Vayu\'s\n\np. 226\n\npurifier is the backward-flowing, exceeding swift Soma,\' he purifies (the\nliquor 1) in the case of one purged by Soma: in a suitable manner he thus\npurifies him (the Sacrificer);--\'Indra\'s faithful companion:\' whatever energy,\nor vital power, had passed away from him with that (Soma), that he now\nrestores to him.\n\n12:7:3:1010\\. With, \'Purified by Vayu\'s purifier is the forward-flowing,\nexceeding swift Soma,\' he purifies (the liquor) in the case of one who has\nvomited Soma: in a suitable manner he thus purifies him (the\nSacrificer);--\'Indra\'s faithful companion:\' whatever energy, or vital power,\nhad passed away from him with that (Soma), that he now restores to him.\n\n12:7:3:1111\\. With (Va _g_. S. XIX, 4), \'She purifieth thy liquor,\' he, for\nprosperity, purifies (the Sura) in the case of one wishing for\nprosperity;--\'thy Soma, she, the daughter of Surya:\' the daughter of Surya\n(the sun) assuredly is Faith, and by faith that (liquor) becomes Soma juice,\nand by faith he makes it to be Soma-juice;--\'with the perpetual tail,\' for\nwith a tail-whisk that (liquor) is purified.\n\n12:7:3:1212\\. With (Va _g_. S. XIX, 5), \'The Brahman\n\np. 227\n\nand Kshatra he purifieth,\' he purifies the milk 1: he thus produces the\nKshatra from out of the Brahman, for from out of the priesthood the nobility\nis produced;--\'the fiery spirit and energy;\' fiery spirit and energy, vital\npower, he thus bestows on him;--\'with the Sura the Soma,\' for with the Sura-\nliquor is Soma;--\'the juice, is distilled,\' for from the distilled the juice\nis obtained;--\'for joy,\' to joy (intoxication), indeed, the Soma juice\ncontributes, and to joy also does the Sura-liquor: he thus secures both the\njoy of the Soma, and the joy of the Sura;--\'with the pure juice, O god,\nsatiate the deities!\' that is, \'with the pure juice satisfy thou the\ndeities;\'--\'with sap bestow thou food on the Sacrificer,\' sap and food he\nthereby bestows on the Sacrificer. The cups of milk are taken first, then the\ncups of Sura-liquor: he thereby makes the peasantry obedient to the nobility.\n\n12:7:3:1313\\. With (Va _g_. S. XIX, 6), \'Yea, even as the owners of barley cut\ntheir barley 2. . .,\' (the Adhvaryu) fills (three) cups of milk,--barley-\nstalks are Soma-stems, and milk is Soma juice: by means of Soma he thus makes\nit Soma-juice. With a single (verse) he fills them: singly and solely on the\nSacrificer he thus bestows prosperity, for milk is prosperity.\n\n12:7:3:1414\\. With (Va _g_. S. XIX, 7), \'Separately, indeed, a seat,\nacceptable to the gods, hath been prepared for you two,\' he fills the (three)\ncups\n\np. 228\n\nof Sura-liquor; for separate, indeed, are the Soma-juice and the Sura-liquor;\nand \'acceptable to the gods\' he says, because these two are indeed acceptable\nto the gods; and \'separately a seat hath been prepared\' he says, because there\nare two altar-grounds;--\'do not ye mingle in the highest heaven!\' he thereby\nkeeps him (the Sacrificer) from evil;--\'the potent Sura-liquor thou art,\' he\nthereby makes Sura to be Sura;--\'and this is Soma,\' he thereby makes Soma to\nbe Soma;--\'entering thine own seat, injure me not!\' he thereby turns it (the\nSura-liquor) away to its own seat for his own safety. With a single (verse) he\nfills them: singly and solely on the Sacrificer he thus bestows fame, for the\nSura-liquor is fame.\n\n12:7:3:1515\\. Verily, the cups of milk are the nobility (chieftaincy), and the\ncups of Sura-liquor are the peasantry (clan): thus, were he to draw (the cups)\nwithout interlinking them, he would detach the peasantry from the nobility,\nand the nobility from the peasantry, and would cause confusion between the\nhigher and lower, and a failure of the sacrifice. He draws them so as to be\ninterlinked 1, and thereby combines the peasantry with the nobility, and the\nnobility with the peasantry, for the prevention of confusion between the\nhigher and lower, and for the success of the sacrifice.\n\n12:7:3:1616\\. And the cups of milk are the vital airs, and the cups of Sura-\nliquor the body: thus, were he\n\np. 229\n\nto draw (the cups) without interlinking them, he would detach the body from\nthe vital airs, and the vital airs from the body, and the Sacrificer would be\nliable to perish. He draws them so as to be interlinked, and thereby combines\nthe body with the vital airs, and the vital airs with the body; and, indeed,\nhe also lays vital power (or life) into him: whence he who has performed the\nSautrama _n_ i, and even he who thus knows this, attains the full (measure of)\nlife.\n\n12:7:3:1717\\. And the cups of milk are Soma, and the cups of Sura-liquor food:\nthus, in that both cups of milk and cups of Sura-liquor are taken, he indeed\nsecures for himself both the Soma-drink and food.\n\n12:7:3:1818\\. And the cups of milk are cattle, and the cups of Sura-liquor\nfood: thus, in that both cups of milk and cups of Sura-liquor are taken, he\nindeed secures for himself both cattle and food.\n\n12:7:3:1919\\. And the cups of milk are domestic animals, and the cups of Sura-\nliquor wild animals: thus, in that both cups of milk and cups of Sura-liquor\nare taken, he indeed secures for himself both domestic and wild animals. And\nhe mixes the cups of milk with both cultivated and wild-growing (fruit),\nwhereby both cultivated and wild-growing food is secured to the domestic\nanimals.\n\n12:7:3:2020\\. As to this they say, \'In that there are those wild beasts, this\nis a form of that cruel deity; and if he were to mix the cups of milk with\nhairs of those beasts, he would thrust the cattle into the mouth of Rudra, and\nthe Sacrificer would be without cattle let him not mix them, or cattle would\nnot be secured by him, for Rudra is the ruler of animals.\' The cups of Sura-\nliquor alone he mixes with hairs of those\n\np. 230\n\nbeasts: he thus puts into the Sura what belongs to Rudra, whence by drinking\nSura-liquor one becomes of violent (raudra) mind; and on the wild beasts alone\nhe thus directs Rudra\'s shaft so as to insure safety to the domestic animals;\nand cattle are secured by him and he does not thrust the cattle into the mouth\nof Rudra.\n\n12:7:3:2121\\. [Va _g_. S. XIX, 10; 11,] \'That dysentery which spareth both the\ntiger and the wolf, the winged eagle and the lion, may it spare this\n(Sacrificer) trouble!--Whereas, as a child, joyfully sucking, I chafed my\nmother, so now, O Agni, I become freed from my debt: unharmed by me are my\nparents.\'\n\n12:7:3:2222\\. With two eagle-feathers, the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasthat _ri_\npurify the Sacrificer, turned towards the cast behind the altar-ground 1, both\nupwards and downwards,--this is a form of the in-breathing and the upward\nbreathing: the in-breathing and the upward breathing he thereby secures; for\nboth upwards and downwards this breath passes along the body. With (Va _g_. S.\nXIX, 1I), \'Uniting ye are: unite me with happiness 2!\' he touches the cups of\nmilk: with prosperity and fame he thereby endows him. With, \'Disuniting ye\nare: disunite me from evil!\' he touches the cups of Sura-liquor: he thereby\nkeeps him from evil.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[223:1](sbe44067.htm#fr_584) Va _g_. S. XIX, 72 seq. On the myth cp. Muir, O.\nS. T., vol. v, p. 94.\n\n[223:2](sbe44067.htm#fr_585) The preparation of the Sura is described in Katy.\nXIX, i, 20-21 and comms., and by Mahidhara on Va _g_. S. XIX, 1, in the\nfollowing way. Having purchased (a) malted rice ( _s_ ashpa), malted barley\n(tokma), and fried rice (la _g_ a _h_ ), and (b) various vegetable substances\n(called with the generic name of nagnahu) serving as spices and ferments, such\nas the bark of Vatica robusta, three p. 224 myrobalans (nutmeg, areca-nut, and\ncloves), ginger, hog-weed, &c., he takes them into the fire-house, and pounds\nthe two lots separately. He then prepares two gruels or mashes of rice and\nmillet respectively, adding more water than is ordinarily used, puts them on\nthe fire till they boil over, and catches the overflowing water in two\nseparate vessels. He then acids thereto one-third part of the (still separate)\npounded malted rice and barley and fried rice (or one-sixth part into each\nvessel), and likewise one-half of the spice (or one-fourth part into each\nvessel): this mixture, called masara (serving both as malt and as flavouring\nmatter), is allowed to dry and is then pounded. One-half of the remaining\npounded malted rice and barley and fried rice, as well as the whole of the\nremaining spices, is then, in equal parts, added to the two mashes, which are\nthereupon poured into a large vessel, after which the pounded \'masara\' is\nmixed with the compound whilst the above formula is pronounced; and the pot is\ndeposited in a hole dug in the south-western corner of the fire-shed ( _s_\nala), where it remains standing for three days (and nights), during which the\nmilk of one, two, and three cows respectively, and the remaining quantities of\nmalted and fried grain are gradually added to it (see [XII, 8, 2,\n8](sbe44069.htm#12:8:2:8)-[10](sbe44069.htm#12:8:2:10)).\n\n[225:1](sbe44067.htm#fr_586) The two Vedis are prepared, in front of the\n\xc3\x82havaniya, by the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasthat _ri_ respectively in a way\nsimilar to those required for the Varu _n_ apraghasa _h_ , see part i, p. 392,\nnote. There is some space between them, but not more than will allow a seat to\nstand on both Vedis ([XII, 8, 3, 6](sbe44070.htm#12:8:3:6)). The dimensions\n(of the northern altar-ground) are in accordance with those of the mahavedi\n(measuring thirty-six prakramas or steps long, twenty-four on the hind (west)\nside, and thirty-six (or thirty) on the front (east) side), except that the\nunit of measure, in this case, is one-third prakrama,--the area being thus\nequal to one-ninth of the mahavedi (some authorities, however, making it one-\nthird). Behind the two Vedis two mounds (khara) are thrown up for the three\ncups of milk, or three cups of Sura-liquor respectively, to be deposited\nthereon. On the northern Vedi an uttara-vedi (high-altar), occupying about\none-third of its area, is prepared, on which a sacrificial fire (taken from\nthe \xc3\x82havaniya) is afterwards laid down for the use of the Adhvaryu in making\nlibations from the cups of milk; another fire being laid down on the southern\nmound for the use of the Pratiprasthat _ri_ in making libations from the cups\nof Sura-liquor.\n\n[226:1](sbe44067.htm#fr_587) This performance thus takes place on the fourth\nday. Behind the mound of the southern Vedi a hole is dug, and an ox-hide\nspread over it. On this skin the unstrained liquor (parisrut) is either\npoured, a fine strainer (made of bamboo) being then laid thereon so that the\nclear liquor percolates through the holes, and the dregs remain below; or the\nstrainer is placed on the skin, and the unstrained liquor is poured on it so\nas to allow the clear liquor to flow through on the skin. The liquor is then\npoured into a pan (sata), and further purified by a whisk of cow and horse-\nhair being drawn through it, or the liquor being strained through the hair.\n\n[227:1](sbe44067.htm#fr_588) This takes place on the northern Vedi, by means\nof a wooden (reed) vessel and a strainer of goat\'s and sheep\'s hair.\n\n[227:2](sbe44067.htm#fr_589) For the complete verse, see V, 5, 4, 24.\n\n[228:1](sbe44067.htm#fr_590) That is to say, in drawing the cups he draws\nalternately a cup of milk, and a cup of Sura; Katy. _S_ r. XIX, 2, 21.\nAccording to ib. 22, the three cups of milk may, however, be drawn first, and\nthen the cups of liquor.\n\n[230:1](sbe44067.htm#fr_591) That is, behind the maha-vedi, near the anta _h_\npatya-peg, where the purchase of the ingredients for the preparation of the\nSura had taken place.\n\n[230:2](sbe44067.htm#fr_592) Cf. V, 1, 2, 18, where the same two formulas are\nused whilst the Soma and Sura-cups are first held together, and then withdrawn\nfrom each other; and the terms \'samp _ri_ _k_ \' and \'vip _ri_ _k_ \' were\naccordingly taken in a passive sense, \'united\' and \'disunited;\' whilst here\nthe active sense seems preferable, the term \'vip _ri_ _k_ \' probably referring\nto the tendency of fiery liquor for producing broils.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XII, 8, 1.
