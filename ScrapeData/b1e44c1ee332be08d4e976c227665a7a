They all depend on\none another, and likewise follow one another 2. There is no doubt of this,\nthat as long 3 as there is goodness so long darkness exists. And as long as\ngoodness and darkness, so long is passion said (to exist) here. They perform\ntheir journey together, in union, and moving about collectively. For they act\nwith cause or without cause 4, moving in a body. Of all these acting with one\nanother, but differing in development, the increase and diminution will now be\nstated. Where darkness is increased, abiding, 5 in the lower entities, there\npassion should be understood to be little, and goodness likewise to be less.\nWhere\n\np. 329\n\npassion is developed, abiding in those of the middle current 1, there darkness\nshould be understood to be little, and goodness likewise to be less. And where\ngoodness is developed, abiding in those of the upward current 2, there\ndarkness should be understood to be little, and passion likewise to be less 3.\nGoodness is the cause of the modifications in the senses, and the enlightener\n4. For there is no other higher duty laid down than goodness. Those who adhere\nto (the ways of) goodness go up; the passionate remain in the middle; the men\nof the quality of darkness, being connected with the lowest quality, go down\n5. The three qualities abide in the three castes thus: darkness in the _S_\nudra, passion in the Kshatriya, and the highest, goodness, in the Brahma _n_ a\n6. Even from afar 7, darkness, goodness, and passion also, are seen to have\nbeen together and moving about collectively. We have never heard of them (as\nexisting) separately. Seeing the sun rising, evildoers are alarmed, and\ntravellers, suffering trouble from the heat, feel the warmth. The sun is\ngoodness developed, evil-doers likewise are darkness, and the heat to the\ntravellers is said to be a property of\n\np. 330\n\npassion 1. The light in the sun is goodness; the heat is the quality of\npassion; and its eclipse on the Parvan 2 days must be understood to be of the\nquality of darkness. So in all shining bodies, there: exist three qualities.\nAnd they act by turns in the several places in several ways. Among immovable\nentities, darkness is in the form of their belonging to the lower species; the\nqualities of passion are variable; and the oleaginous property is of the\nquality of goodness 3. The day should be understood to be threefold, the night\nis stated to be threefold, and likewise months, half-months, years, seasons,\nand the conjunctions 4. Threefold are the gifts given 5, threefold the\nsacrifices performed, threefold are the\n\np. 331\n\nworlds, threefold the gods, threefold the (departments of) knowledge, and\nthreefold the path 1. The past, the present, and the future; piety, wealth,\nand lust; the Pra _n_ a, the Apana, and the Udana; these are the three\nqualities. And whatever there is in this world, all that is (made of) these\nthree qualities 2. The three qualities--goodness, passion, and darkness also--\nare always acting unperceived. The creation of the qualities is eternal.\nDarkness, unperceived, holy 3, constant, unborn, womb, eternal, nature, change\n4, destruction, Pradhana, production and absorption, not developed, not small,\nunshaking, immovable, immutable, existent and also non-existent 5\\--all these,\nthe unperceived, (consisting) of the three qualities, is said to be. These\nnames should be learnt by men who ponder on matters relating to the self. He\nwho understands correctly all the names of the unperceived, and the qualities,\nand its pure operations, he, freed from the body, understanding the truth\nabout (all) distinctions, and being free from all misery, is released from all\nqualities.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[328:1](sbe0850.htm#fr_1599) Cf. Gita inter alia, [p.\n104](sbe0815.htm#page_104).\n\n[328:2](sbe0851.htm#fr_1600) Cf. [p. 318](sbe0848.htm#page_318) supra.\n\n[328:3](sbe0851.htm#fr_1601) So Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra. Nilaka _nth_ a says on\nthis, 'However much goodness may be increased, it is still held in cheek by\ndarkness, and thus there is the continual relation of that which checks and\nthat which is checked between the three qualities; hence they are alike. So\nalso passion being increased, holds goodness and darkness in cheek. The sense\nseems to be that the qualities dominate all in this world and exist together\nthough varying in strength' (Gita, [p. 73](sbe0808.htm#page_73)).\n\n[328:4](sbe0851.htm#fr_1602) I. e. spontaneously, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra. Cf.\n_S_ anti Parvan (Moksha), chap. 194, st. 35.\n\n[328:5](sbe0851.htm#fr_1603) It is in the lower species that darkness is\npredominant.\n\n[329:1](sbe0851.htm#fr_1604) I. e. the human species, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\nCf. Gita, [p. 109](sbe0816.htm#page_109).\n\n[329:2](sbe0851.htm#fr_1605) See Gita, [p. 109](sbe0816.htm#page_109), also\n[p. 327](sbe0850.htm#page_327) supra. In his Sa _n_ khyatattvakaumudi, Va _k_\naspati Mi _s_ ra applies the epithet to Yogins (see p. 13 of Taranath's\nedition, and the editor's note there)\n\n[329:3](sbe0851.htm#fr_1606) Cf. Gita, [p. 108](sbe0816.htm#page_108).\n\n[329:4](sbe0851.htm#fr_1607) Cf. Gita, [p. 109](sbe0816.htm#page_109). The\nmodifications of the senses constituting perception by them is an operation of\nthe quality of goodness. This seems to be the meaning of the text; as to this,\ncf. Tattvakaumudi, p. 14 (Taranath's edition).\n\n[329:5](sbe0851.htm#fr_1608) See Gita, [p. 109](sbe0816.htm#page_109); the\nwords are nearly identical.\n\n[329:6](sbe0851.htm#fr_1609) Cf. Santi Parvan (Moksha), chap. 188, st. 15. The\nVai _s_ ya is omitted here.\n\n[329:7](sbe0851.htm#fr_1610) I. e. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says, even after much\nobservation.\n\n[330:1](sbe0851.htm#fr_1611) This illustrates the existence of the qualities\nas one body. Even the enlightening sun, which embodies the quality of\ngoodness, produces effects which belong to the other qualities. The fear and\nsorrow which evil-doers, that is thieves, feel, is an effect of the rising of\nthe sun, which appertains to the quality of darkness, and the heat as being\nthe cause of vexation and consequent delusion to travellers, appertains to the\nquality of passion.\n\n[330:2](sbe0851.htm#fr_1612) I. e. the days of the moon's conjunction or\nopposition.\n\n[330:3](sbe0851.htm#fr_1613) I understand this to mean that in the 'immovable\nentities' the three qualities co-exist; the birth in the lower species is an\neffect of darkness; the variable qualities, viz. the heat, &c., as Ar _g_ una\nMi _s_ ra says, are the properties of passion; and the oleaginous properties\namong them appertain to goodness, as, says Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, they are\nsources of pleasure (cf. Gita, [p. 118](sbe0819.htm#page_118)). Nilaka _nth_ a\nsays, 'Immovable entities being very unintelligent, darkness is very much\ndeveloped among them,' but this last, as an interpretation of tiryagbhavagata,\nappears to me to be alike unwarranted and inappropriate here.\n\n[330:4](sbe0851.htm#fr_1614) Does this mean the period about the close of one\nand beginning of another yuga or age? That is the only sense ejusdem generis\nwith the words preceding it that I can think of;--yet the jump from years to\nyuga-sandhis is a long one.\n\n[330:5](sbe0851.htm#fr_1615) Cf. Gita, [p. 120](sbe0819.htm#page_120). With\nreference to some, at least, of the things enumerated here, the division would\nbe rather fanciful.\n\n[331:1](sbe0851.htm#fr_1616) see these three mentioned at _Kh_ andogya, pp.\n340-359. As to departments of knowledge, cf. Gita, [p.\n84](sbe0811.htm#page_84); Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra reads, 'threefold the Vedas.'\n\n[331:2](sbe0851.htm#fr_1617) The universe is all developed from the Prakriti,\nwhich is merely the three 'qualities in equilibrium.' Cf. Sa _n_ khya-sutra I,\n61.\n\n[331:3](sbe0851.htm#fr_1618) Because it gives final emancipation to one who\ndiscriminates it from Purusha, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra. Cf. Sa _n_ khya-sutra II,\n1 seq., and Sa _n_ khya-karika, p. 56 seq., and commentary. For another list\nof names of Prak _ri_ ti, see _S_ veta _s_ vatara (comm.), p. 283.\n\n[331:4](sbe0851.htm#fr_1619) Nature is not a development from anything, and\nhence is called avik _ri_ ti in Sa _n_ khya-karika 3; but 'change' here\nprobably means the whole aggregate of Vik _ri_ tis, 'changes' or developments,\nwhich make up Prak _ri_ ti; or by a different derivation it may, perhaps, also\nmean that from which all development or change takes place.\n\n[331:5](sbe0851.htm#fr_1620) See Sa _n_ khya-sutra V, 52-56; and also I, 26,\nand commentary here. The Vedantins speak of Maya\\--which answers to what the\np. 332 Sa _n_ khyas call Prak _ri_ ti (see _S_ veta _s_ vatara, p. 340, and Sa\n_n_ khya-sutra I, 69, and commentary there)--as 'sattvasattvabhyamanirva _k_\nya.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXV](sbe0852.htm)\n\n"
