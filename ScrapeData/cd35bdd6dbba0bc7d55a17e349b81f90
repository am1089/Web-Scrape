O foremost of the family of Raghu, I make prostrations to Thee\nagain and again. O R\xc4\x81ma, I wish to know for the sake of emancipation, Thy\nnature as it really is. O R\xc4\x81ma, be Thou gracious enough to tell me that by\nwhich I shall be easily released from the bondage of mundane existence and by\nwhich I shall attain salvation."\n\n(\xc5\x9ar\xc4\xab-R\xc4\x81ma replied:) "O mighty-armed one, well asked: hearken then to the truth\nuttered by Me. I am well established in Ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada (or the end of Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das or\nknowledge). Have thou recourse to Ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada well."\n\n(Han\xc5\xabm\xc4\x81n again asked:) "O foremost of Raghus, what are Ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xadas? where do they\nabide? Pray enlighten me." (\xc5\x9ar\xc4\xab-Rama replied:) "O Han\xc5\xabm\xc4\x81n, listen to Me. I\nshall truly describe\n\np. 2\n\nto you the nature of Ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada. Through the expiratory breath of Myself--Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u,\nthe Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das were generated as many. Like the oil in the sesamum seeds, Ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada\nis well established (or latent) in the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das."\n\n(Han\xc5\xabm\xc4\x81n asked again:) "O R\xc4\x81ma, how many are the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das and their branches? O\nR\xc4\x81ghava, what are the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds? Please, through Thy grace, tell me truly."\n\n(\xc5\x9ar\xc4\xab-R\xc4\x81ma said:) "Through the divisions of \xe1\xb9\x9agve\xe1\xb8\x8da and others, the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das are\nsaid to be four in number. Their branches are many. So also the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds. In\n\xe1\xb9\x9agve\xe1\xb8\x8da, there are branches, 21 in number. O son of V\xc4\x81yu, there are 109\nbranches in Yajurve\xe1\xb8\x8da. O conqueror of enemies, there are 1,000 branches in\nS\xc4\x81mave\xe1\xb8\x8da. O best of Monkeys, there are 50 branches in A\xe1\xb9\xadharva\xe1\xb9\x87ave\xe1\xb8\x8da. In each\nbranch, there is one Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d. Whoever with devotion to Me studies even one\nof the \xe1\xb9\x9aks (hymns) in these, attains the state of absorption, rare for the\nMunis to attain."\n\n(Han\xc5\xabm\xc4\x81n asked:) "O R\xc4\x81ma, some excellent Munis have said there is one kind of\nsalvation only, while others [stated that salvation is attained] through the\nuttering of Thy name or the initiation into \xe1\xb9\xac\xc4\x81raka (Om) at K\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b\xc4\xab (Benares);\nothers through S\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x85khya-Yoga, others through the Yoga of Devotion; other\nMah\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x9bshis through the meditation upon the meaning of Mah\xc4\x81v\xc4\x81kyas (the sacred\nsentences of the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das). Salvation is stated to be of four kinds through the\ndivisions of S\xc4\x81lokya and others."\n\n(\xc5\x9ar\xc4\xab-R\xc4\x81ma replied:) "There is only one true emancipation. O Kapi (Monkey),\neven a person addicted to evil practices attains the salvation of S\xc4\x81lokya (My\nworld) through the uttering of My name, but not of other worlds. Should one\ndie in Brahma-n\xc4\x81.la (the lotus-stalk--also street) in K\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b\xc4\xab, 1 he attains My\n\xe1\xb9\xac\xc4\x81raka (Man\xe1\xb9\xadra). Such a person attains salvation without any rebirth; wherever\nhe may die in K\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b\xc4\xab, Mahe\xc5\x9bwara initiates him by whispering My \xe1\xb9\xac\xc4\x81raka (Man\xe1\xb9\xadra)\ninto his right ear. Such person, freed from all sins, attains My Swar\xc5\xabpa\n(Form). It is this that is termed S\xc4\x81lokya-S\xc4\x81r\xc5\xabpya salvation. The twice-born\nwho is of virtuous conduct and who, without diverting his\n\np. 3\n\nintelligence on any other, meditates upon Me, the All-\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, attains S\xc4\x81m\xc4\xabpya\n(nearness) to Me.\n\n"It is this that is termed S\xc4\x81lokya-S\xc4\x81r\xc5\xabpya-S\xc4\x81m\xc4\xabpya salvation. The twice-born\nwho according to the path opened by the teacher, meditates upon My immutable\nReality attains S\xc4\x81yujya (absorption) into Me, like the caterpillar into the\nwasp. This is the S\xc4\x81yujya salvation which is productive of Br\xc4\x81hmic bliss and\nauspicious. Thus these kinds of salvation arise through the Up\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81 (worship)\nof Me.\n\n"The only means by which the final emancipation is attained is through\nM\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87d\xc5\xabkya-Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d alone, which is enough for the salvation of all aspirants.\nIf J\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na is not attained thereby, study the 10 Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds; thou shalt soon\nattain J\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na , and then My Seat. O son of A\xc3\xb1jan\xc4\x81, if thy J\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na is not made\nfirm, practise (study) well the 32 Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds. Thou shalt get release. If thou\nlongest after Vi\xe1\xb8\x8dehamuk\xe1\xb9\xadi (or disembodied salvation), study the 108\nUpanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds. I will truly state in order the (names of the) Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds with\ntheir \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xadi (purificatory Man\xe1\xb9\xadras). Hearken to them.

There is no doubt of it. O son of V\xc4\x81yu,\nthese 108 Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds, which are the essence of all the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds, and are\ncapable of destroying all sins through their mere study, have been imparted by\nMe to you as a disciple. This science of the 108 Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds taught by Me, is\nan occult one, and will free persons from bondage, whether they read them with\nor without knowledge. To gratify the desire of a supplicant, a kingdom may be\ngiven or wealth, but never shall the 108 Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds be imparted to an atheist,\nan ungrateful person, one intent on vicious actions, one having no devotion\ntowards Me, or one who loses his path in the cave of books. On no account\nshall they be given to one devoid of devotion. O M\xc4\x81ru\xe1\xb9\xadi, it is only after a\nthorough examination that they should be imparted to a disciple doing service\n(to a Guru), to a well-disposed son, or to one devoted to Me, following good\nobservances, belonging to a good family, and being of good intelligence.\nWhoever studies or hears the 108 Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds attains Me. There is no doubt of\nthis. This is stated in the \xe1\xb9\x9ak (verse) thus--Vi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81 (Saraswa\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab) went to a\nBr\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a (and addressed him) thus: \'Protect me.

Thus is the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d."\n\n##### A\xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81ya II\n\nAgain M\xc4\x81ru\xe1\xb9\xadi (Han\xc5\xabm\xc4\x81n) addressed \xc5\x9ar\xc4\xab-R\xc4\x81machan\xe1\xb8\x8dra thus: "What is J\xc4\xabvanmuk\xe1\xb9\xadi?\nwhat is Vi\xe1\xb8\x8dehamuk\xe1\xb9\xadi? what is the authority therein? what about its perfection?\nwhat is the object of such a perfection?"\n\n(\xc5\x9ar\xc4\xab-R\xc4\x81ma replied:) "The \xe1\xb8\x8charma of a man\'s Chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada that has the characteristics\nof agency and enjoyment is fraught with pains and hence tends towards bondage.\nThe control of it (the Chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada) is J\xc4\xabvanmuk\xe1\xb9\xadi. Vi\xe1\xb8\x8dehamuk\xe1\xb9\xadi follows when through\nthe extinction of Pr\xc4\x81rab\xe1\xb8\x8dha, the removal of the vehicles [of the bodies] takes\nplace like the ether in the pot [after the pot is broken]. The authority on\nthe points of J\xc4\xabvanmuk\xe1\xb9\xadi and Vi\xe1\xb8\x8dehamuk\xe1\xb9\xadi is the 108 Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds. Its object [of\nperfection] is the attaining of eternal bliss through the removal of the pains\nof agency, etc. This has to be achieved through human efforts. Like progeny\nobtained through the Pu\xe1\xb9\xadrak\xc4\x81meshti sacrifice, wealth in trade, or heaven\nthrough the Jyo\xe1\xb9\xadishtoma sacrifice, so J\xc4\xabvanmuk\xe1\xb9\xadi is gained through Sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi\narising through Ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xadic study, and accomplished through human efforts. It has\nto be won through the extinction of all V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s. Regarding it, there are\nverses\n\np. 7\n\nthus: \'The efforts of man are stated to be of two kinds, those that transcend\nscriptures and those that are according to scriptures. Those that transcend\nscriptures tend to harm while those that are according to scriptures tend to\nReality.\' To men, true J\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na does not arise through the V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s of the world,\nscripture and body. V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81 is divided into two, the pure and the impure. If\nthou art led by the pure V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s, thou shalt thereby soon reach by degrees My\nSeat. But should the old impure V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s land thee in danger, they should be\novercome through efforts. This river of V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s towards objects, which flows\nin the pure and impure paths, should be diverted to the pure path through\nhuman efforts. The impure ones have to be transmuted into the pure. That which\nis diverted from the impure turns towards the pure. So also the reverse. This\nchild, Chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada has to be fondled through human efforts. O killer of enemies, it\nis only when through means of practice both V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s quite abandon thee, that\nthou wilt be able to realise the effects of [such] practice. Even in the case\nof doubt, the pure V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s alone should be practised.\n\n"O son of V\xc4\x81yu, there is nothing wrong in the increase of the pure V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s.\nThe extinction of V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s, Vij\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na and the destruction of Manas [as these\nthree] when practised together for a long time are regarded, O great and\nintelligent one, as fruitful. So long as these are not equally practised again\nand again, so long the [Supreme] Seat is not attained, even after the lapse of\nhundreds of years. Even should one of these [three] be practised for a long\ntime, it will not yield its fruit like a Man\xe1\xb9\xadra imperfectly done. Through the\npractice of these for a long time, the firm knots of the heart are cut,\nwithout doubt, like the breaking of the threads in a lotus-stalk rent in\ntwain. The illusory Sams\xc4\x81ric V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81 that has arisen through the practice of\n[many] hundreds of lives never perishes except through the practice of Yoga\nfor a long time. Therefore, O Somya [disciple], after having put away to a\ndistance the desire of enjoyment through discriminative human effort, resort\nto these three alone. The wise know that a mind associated with V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81 tends\nto bondage, while a mind well freed from\n\np. 8\n\n[paragraph continues] V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81 is said to be an emancipated one. O Mah\xc4\x81-kapi\n[great Monkey] practise the state of a mind devoid of V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81. V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81 perishes\nthrough well-conducted deliberation and truth. Through the absorption of\nV\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s, Manas attains quiescence like a lamp [without oil]. He whose mind,\ndevoid of destruction, is [centred] on Me as of the nature of Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra\n[consciousness alone], abandoning the [V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s](errata.htm#0), is no other\nthan Myself of the nature of Sachchi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81nan\xe1\xb8\x8da. Whether [Sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi](errata.htm#1)\nand Karma are performed or not, one who has a supreme Chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada with a heart\ndevoid of all desires is an emancipated person. He whose mind is freed from\nV\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s is not subject to the fruits arising from the performance or non-\nperformance of actions, or Sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi or J\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na. Except through the entire giving\nup of V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s and through Mouna [the observance of silence towards objects],\nthe Supreme Seat is not attained. Though devoid of V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s, the eye and other\norgans are involuntarily prompted to their (respective) external objects\nthrough habit. Just as the eye without any desire sees without any effort the\nobjects that fall on it, so also the undaunted man of intelligence enters into\nthe affairs [of the world] without any desire. O M\xc4\x81ru\xe1\xb9\xadi, the Munis know that\nas V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81 which is manifested through the consciousness of objects, which is\nof the nature of the object itself, and which is the cause of the origination\nand absorption of Chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada. This excessively fluctuating Chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada is the cause of\nbirth, dotage and death, due to the identification of itself with objects\npractised firmly [for a long time]. Like the analogy of the seed and the tree,\nthe vibration of Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a arises through V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81 and ( _vice versa_ ) the V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81\nthrough the former--these forming the seed of Chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada. To the tree of Chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada,\nthere are two seeds: the vibration of Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a and V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81. Should either of them\nperish, both perish soon. Through the actions of the world being done without\nattachment, through the abandoning of the [thought of the] reality of the\nuniverse and the conviction of the destructibility of the body, V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81 does\nnot arise. Through the complete giving up of V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81, Chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada becomes not-\nChi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada. When the mind does not think at all, being completely devoid of\nV\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81, then dawns the state of mindlessness which confers the\n\np. 9\n\ngreat peace. So long as you are without a mind of [true] discrimination and\nare not a knower of the Supreme Seat, so long should you follow whatever has\nbeen decided by the teacher and the authorities of the sacred books. When your\nsins are burnt up and you are a knower of the Reality without any anxiety,\nthen all the good V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s even should be given up.\n\n"The destruction of Chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada is of two kinds, that with form and that without\nform. [The destruction of] that with form is of the J\xc4\xabvanmuk\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81; (the\ndestruction of), that without form being of the Vi\xe1\xb8\x8dehamuk\xe1\xb9\xada. O son of V\xc4\x81yu,\nhearken to [the means of] the destruction of Chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada. That is said to be the\ndestruction of Chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada when it, associated with all the attributes of Mai\xe1\xb9\xadri\n(friendship) and others, becomes quiescent [without any resurrection]. There\nis no doubt of it. Then the Manas of a J\xc4\xabvanmuk\xe1\xb9\xada is free from fresh rebirth;\nto him, there is the destruction of Manas with form. But to the Vi\xe1\xb8\x8dehamuk\xe1\xb9\xada,\nthere is the destruction of Man as without form. It is Manas that is the root\nof the tree of Sams\xc4\x81ra with its thousands of shoots, branches, tender leaves\nand fruits. I think it to be Sa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpa alone. In order that the tree of Sams\xc4\x81ra\nmay wither soon, dry up its root through the quiescence of Sa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpa. There is\nonly one means to control one\'s mind. That is to destroy the mind as soon as\nit rises. That is the (great) dawn. In the case of the wise, the mind is\ndestroyed: but in the case of the ignorant, it is indeed a fetter. So long as\nthe mind is not destroyed through the firm practice of the One Reality, so\nlong as V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s are prancing about in the heart like Ve\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81la (goblin) in the\nnight-time. The V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s of enjoyment of one who has destroyed the egoism of\nChi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada and controlled the organs, the enemies, decay like lotuses in mid-\nwinter. Pressing one hand against the other, setting teeth against teeth, and\nforcing one limb against the other, he should first conquer his mind.\n\n"It is not possible on the part of the one-thoughted to control the mind by\nsitting up again and again except through the approved means. As a vicious\nrutting elephant is not subject to control except through the goad, so in the\nmatter of the control of the mind, the effective means are the attainment of\n\np. 10\n\nspiritual knowledge, association with the wise, the entire abdication of all\nV\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s and the control of pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as. While such are the [prescribed] means,\nshould persons try to control the mind through violence, they are like those\nthat search in darkness, having thrown aside the light (in their hands). Those\nwho endeavour to control the mind through force are but trying to bind a mad\nelephant with the filaments of a lotus-stalk.\n\nTo the tree of the mind having the ever-growing branches of modifications,\nthere are two seeds. One is the fluctuation of Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a, and the other is the\nfirmness of V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81. The [One] All-pervading Consciousness is agitated by the\nfluctuation of Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a. The means of \xe1\xb8\x8chy\xc4\x81na by which [the one] J\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na is attained\nthrough the one-pointedness of the mind is now imparted to you. After duly\nresolving back the things originated [in the universe] with all their changes,\nmeditate upon that which remains--[ _viz_.], Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra (the consciousness\nalone), which is also Chi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81nan\xe1\xb8\x8da (conscious-bliss). The wise say that the\ninterval experienced by Yogins after the inspiration and before the (next)\nexpiration is [the internal] Kumbhaka (cessation of breath); while the\ninterval of complete equilibrium after expiration and before the next\ninspiration is the external Kumbhaka. Through the force of the practice of\n\xe1\xb8\x8chy\xc4\x81na, the current of the modification of Manas devoid of Self that is of\nBr\xc4\x81hmic nature is said to be Sampraj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xada Sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi, while the mind with the\nutter quiescence of modifications that confers upon one supreme bliss is said\nto be Asampraj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xada-Sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi that is dear unto Yogins. This [state] that is\ndevoid of light, Manas and Bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi, and that is of the nature of Chi\xe1\xb9\xad\n(consciousness merely) is styled by the Munis A\xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb8\x8dvy\xc4\x81v\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadi Sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi (a Sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi\nthat does not care or require the aid of another). It is Plenum above, below\nand in the middle, and is of the nature of \xc5\x9aiva (auspiciousness). This\nnoumenal (or occult) Sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi is itself Vi\xe1\xb8\x8dhi-Mukha (sanctioned by books or\nBrahm\xc4\x81).\n\n"The clinging to objects without previous or subsequent deliberation through\nintense thought [or longing] is stated to be V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81. O chief of Monkeys,\nwhatever is meditated upon by a person with ardent impetuosity without any\nother V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81\n\np. 11\n\n[paragraph continues] --that he soon becomes. A person that is entirely\nsubject to V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81 becomes of the nature of that. When he regards this\n[universe] as Sa\xe1\xb9\xad [the Reality], then he is subject to delusion. Because of\nthe many strong V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s, he does not abandon the nature of the universe. This\nperson of wrong vision sees everything under infatuation like one deluded.\nV\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s are of two kinds--the pure and the impure. The impure ones are the\ncause of rebirth, while the pure are the destroyers of it. The impure are said\nby the wise to be of the nature of intense Aj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, associated with the great\nAha\xe1\xb9\x85k\xc4\x81ra and generative of rebirth. Of what avail is the chewing again and\nagain of the many \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81s\xe1\xb9\xadric stories to one that has abandoned the seed of\nrebirth, having turned it into a burnt one? O M\xc4\x81ru\xe1\xb9\xadi, thou shouldst with\neffort seek the effulgence within. O tiger of Monkeys, whoever, after having\nabandoned the visible and the invisible, is as the One alone is not a mere\nknower of Brahman but is Brahman itself. One who having studied the four Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das\nand the various books does not cognize the reality of Brahman is like the\nladle ignorant of the taste of the dainty. Therefore what other advice of\nindifference can be imparted to a person that has not attained the\nindifference to the impure V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81 of delusion [or body]? This body is very\nimpure while the one [\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81] that dwells in it is very pure. When the\ndifferences between the two are [thus] known, what then may be ordained as the\npurification? The bondage of V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81 is the [real] bondage, while the\ndestruction of V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81 is salvation. After wholly abandoning the V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s, give\nup even the desire for salvation. After first giving up the V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81 of objects\ndependent upon the V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81 of the mind, attract unto thyself the pure V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s\nassociated with Mai\xe1\xb9\xadri [friendship] and others. Though engaged in the world\nwith these pure V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s, give up them too and retire within the quiescent\ndesires and become of the form of the longing after Chi\xe1\xb9\xad alone. Then, O\nM\xc4\x81ru\xe1\xb9\xadi! giving up that also associated as it is with Manas and Bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi, mayst\nthou now left alone become firm in Me in Sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi. O son of V\xc4\x81yu! always\nworship My Reality that is destructive of pains, without sound, touch, form,\ndecay, taste, destruction or smell, and without name and\n\np. 12\n\n[paragraph continues] Go\xe1\xb9\xadra [clan]. I am that non-dual One (Brahman) that is\nof the nature of the visible (J\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na), like unto the \xc4\x80k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, supreme, always\nshining, without birth, non-dual, without destruction, without attachment and\npervading all. I am the All, and of the nature of salvation. One should ever\nmeditate upon Me thus: \'I am of the form of the visible [J\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na], the pure, of\nchangeless nature and have really no objects in Me. I am the ever-full\nBrahman, transverse and across, up and down.\' Also meditate upon Me thus: \'I\nam birthless, deathless, ageless, immortal, self-shining, all-pervading,\ndestructionless, causeless, pure beyond the effect (of the universe) and ever\ncontent.\' When one\'s body becomes a prey to time, he gives up the state of\nJ\xc4\xabvanmuk\xe1\xb9\xadi, as the wind attains the motionless state.\n\n"The following is said in the _\xe1\xb9\x9a g_ [-Ve\xe1\xb8\x8da] also: Like the eye which is spread\nin the \xc4\x80k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b (seeing all things without any obstacle), so the wise ever see the\nSupreme.
