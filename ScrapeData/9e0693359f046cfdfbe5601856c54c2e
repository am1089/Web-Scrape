When _G_ anaka Vaideha was sitting (to give audience), Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya\napproached, and _G_ anaka Vaideha said: \'Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, for what object\ndid you come, wishing for cattle, or for subtle questions 1?\'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya replied: \'For both, Your Majesty;\n\n2\\. \'Let us hear what anybody may have told you.\'\n\n_G_ anaka Vaideha replied: \' _G_ itvan _S_ ailini told me that speech (vak) is\nBrahman.\'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: \'As one who had (the benefit of a good) father,\nmother, and teacher might tell, so did Sailini 2 tell you, that speech is\nBrahman; for what is the use of a dumb person? But did he tell you the body\n(ayatana) and the resting-place (pratish _th_ a) of that Brahman?\'\n\n_G_ anaka Vaideha said: \'He did not tell me.\'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: \'Your Majesty, this (Brahman) stands on one leg only\n3.\'\n\n_G_ anaka Vaideha said: \'Then tell me, Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya.\'\n\np. 153\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: \'The tongue is its body, ether its place, and one\nshould worship it as knowledge.\'\n\n_G_ anaka Vaideha said: \'What is the nature of that knowledge?\'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya replied: \'Your Majesty, speech itself (is knowledge). For\nthrough speech, Your Majesty, a friend is known (to be a friend), and likewise\nthe _Ri_ g-Veda, Ya _g_ ur-veda, Sama-veda, the Atharva\xe1\xb9\x85girasas, the Itihasa\n(tradition), Pura _n_ a-vidya (knowledge of the past), the Upanishads, _S_\nlokas (verses), Sutras (rules), Anuvyakhyanas and Vyakhyanas (commentaries 1,\n&c.); what is sacrificed, what is poured out, what is (to be) eaten and drunk,\nthis world and the other world, and all creatures. By speech alone, Your\nMajesty, Brahman is known, speech indeed, O King, is the Highest Brahman.\nSpeech does not desert him who worships that (Brahman) with such knowledge,\nall creatures approach him, and having become a god, he goes to the gods.\'\n\n_G_ anaka Vaideha said: \'I shall give you (for this) a thousand cows with a\nbull as big as an elephant.\'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: \'My father was of opinion that one should not accept\na reward without having fully instructed a pupil.\'\n\n3\\.
