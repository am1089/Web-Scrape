(The initial statement identifies the individual soul and the highest\nSelf) because the soul when it will depart (from the body) is such (i.e. one\nwith the highest Self); thus Au _d_ ulomi thinks.\n\nThe individual soul which is inquinated by the contact with its different\nlimiting adjuncts, viz. body, senses, and mind (mano-buddhi), attains through\nthe instrumentality of knowledge, meditation, and so on, a state of complete\nserenity, and thus enables itself, when passing at some future time out of the\nbody, to become one with the highest Self; hence the initial statement in\nwhich it is represented as non-different from the highest Self. This is the\nopinion of the teacher Au _d_ ulomi.--Thus Scripture says, 'That serene being\narising from this body appears in its own form as soon as it has approached\nthe highest light' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 12, 3).--In another place Scripture\nintimates, by means of the simile of the rivers, that name and form abide in\nthe individual soul, 'As\n\np. 278\n\nthe flowing rivers disappear in the sea, having lost their name and their\nform, thus a wise man freed from name and form goes to the divine Person who\nis greater than the great' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 8). I.e. as the rivers losing the\nnames and forms abiding in them disappear in the sea, so the individual soul\nalso losing the name and form abiding in it becomes united with the highest\nperson. That the latter half of the passage has the meaning here assigned to\nit, follows from the parallelism which we must assume to exist between the two\nmembers of the comparison 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[278:1](sbe34132.htm#fr_248) Bhamati: The individual soul is absolutely\ndifferent from the highest Self; it is inquinated by the contact with its\ndifferent limiting adjuncts. But it is spoken of, in the Upanishad, as non-\ndifferent from the highest Self because after having purified itself by means\nof knowledge and meditation it may pass out of the body and become one with\nthe highest Self. The text of the Upanishad thus transfers a future state of\nnon-difference to that time when difference actually exists. Compare the\nsaying of the Pa _\xc3\xb1 k_aratrikas: 'Up to the moment of emancipation being\nreached the soul and the highest Self are different. But the emancipated soul\nis no longer different from the highest Self, since there is no further cause\nof difference.'--The technical name of the doctrine advocated by Au _d_ ulomi\nis satyabhedavada.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4, 22](sbe34133.htm)\n\n"
