Jones's celebrated translation of the Code of Manu. What\ncaused it to be brought before the notice of the learned world, was its\nbearing on the origin and history of the authoritative law-book of ancient\nIndia. The statements extracted by Sir W. Jones from the opening chapter of\nNarada's law-book require some modification at present, as he was not\nacquainted with the larger and more authentic of the two versions of Narada's\nwork, which is now translated. It appears from the present work (pp.\n[1](sbe3304.htm#page_1)-[4](sbe3304.htm#page_4)) that Narada, the reputed\ncompiler of the Naradiya Dharma _s_ astra, refers to four, instead of three,\nsuccessive versions of the Code of Manu, in 100,000 _s_ lokas or 1,080\nchapters, in 12,000, 8,000, and 4,000 _s_ lokas. The authorship of these four\nversions is assigned, respectively, to Manu, Narada, Marka _n_ _d_ eya, and\nSumati, the son of Bh _ri_ gu, and the Narada-sm _ri_ ti is described as an\nabridgment, made by Narada, of the ninth or Vyavahara (legal) chapter of the\noriginal Code in 100,000 _s_ lokas. The first part of Narada's abridgment of\nthe ninth chapter of Manu's Code is designed as a mat _ri_ ka or vyavahara-mat\n_ri_ ka, 'summary of proceedings-at-law' or 'general rules of procedure.'\n\nThough the mythical nature of the Preface to the Narada-sm _ri_ ti Explanation\nof the legend.is sufficiently apparent, some facts which recently have come to\nlight impart a higher degree of probability to the alleged connexion between\nManu and Narada, than was formerly allowed by myself. Thus the contents of\nNarada's Preface to his Sm _ri_ ti appear\n\np. xii\n\nto have been known to such an early author as Medhatithi, who quotes it,\nrather loosely it is true, in his Commentary on the Code of Manu, where he\nsays that 'this work, consisting of one hundred thousand ( _s_ lokas), was\ncomposed by Pra _g_ apati and abridged successively by Manu and the rest 1.'\nThis goes far to prove that the Preface to the Narada-sm _ri_ ti had attained\nnotoriety as early as the ninth century A.D., and must be nearly or quite as\nold as the remainder of the work. The antiquity of the account given by Narada\nof the origin and history of the principal code of ancient India is supported\nto some extent by the Paura _n_ ik statement regarding four successive\nremodellings of the original composition of Svaya _m_ bhuva (Manu), by Bh _ri_\ngu, Narada, B _ri_ haspati, and A\xe1\xb9\x85giras 2, and by a curious tradition\npreserved in the Mahabharata, to the effect that the original Dharma _s_\nastra, produced by Brahman in 100,000 chapters, was successively reduced to\n10,000, 5,000, 3,000, and 1,000 chapters by _S_ a _m_ kara, Indra, B _ri_\nhaspati, and Kavya 3. What is more, in a colophon of the ancient Nepalese MS.\nof the Narada-sm _ri_ ti, that work is actually designed as the Manava Dharma\n_s_ astra in the recension of Narada (manave dharma _s_ astre naradaproktaya\n_m_ sa _m_ hitayam), just as the Code of Manu in the colophons is usually\ncalled the Manava Dharma _s_ astra in the recension of Bh _ri_ gu (manave\ndharma _s_ astre bh _ri_ guproktaya _m_ sa _m_ hitayam, or manave dharma _s_\nastre bh _ri_ guprokte). Again, the chapter on theft ( _k_ aurapratishedha),\nwhich has come to light in Mr. Bendall's Nepalese Palm-leaf MS. of Narada, and\nin a Nepalese paper MS. recently discovered by the same scholar, forms an\nappendix to the body of the Narada-sm _ri_ ti, exactly in the same way as an\nanalogous chapter on robbery and other criminal offences is tacked on at the\nclose of the eighteen titles of law in the Code of Manu, IX, 252-293. It also\ndeserves to be noted, perhaps, that the Dhamathats of Burma, while professing\nto be founded\n\np. xiii\n\non the laws of Manu, contain several rules and maxims which may be traced to\nthe Narada-sm _ri_ ti, whereas they do not occur in the Code of Manu 1.\n\nAlthough, therefore, there appears to be an element of Manu anterior to\nNarada.truth in Narada's account of the history of the Code of Manu, and of\nhis own Sm _ri_ ti, there can be no doubt that the actual position of the two\nworks has been inverted by him. The composition of Bh _ri_ gu, or of Sumati,\nthe son of Bh _ri_ gu, i.e. the now extant Code of Manu, is not posterior, but\ndecidedly anterior, in date to the Narada-sm _ri_ ti, as may be gathered\neasily from a comparison of both works. Thus e.g. Narada mentions twenty-one\nmodes of acquiring property, fifteen sorts of slaves, fourteen species of\nimpotency, three kinds of women twice married, and four kinds of wanton women,\ntwenty women whom a man must not approach, thirty-two divisions of the law of\ngift, eleven sorts of witnesses, five or seven ordeals, four or five losers of\ntheir suit, two kinds of proof and two kinds of documents, seven advantages\nresulting from a just decision, eight members of a lawsuit, one hundred and\nthirty-two divisions of the eighteen principal titles of law. The first germs\nof some of these theories may be traced to the Code of Manu, and it is\ninteresting to note how these germs have been developed by Narada. As a rule,\nhis judicial theories show an infinitely advanced stage of development as\ncompared to Manu's, and his treatment of the law of procedure, in particular,\nabounding as it does in technical terms and nice distinctions, and exhibiting\na decided preference for documentary evidence and written records over oral\ntestimony and verbal procedure, exhibits manifest signs of recent composition.\n\nAn analogous inference may be drawn from the fact that Narada acquainted with\nthe Code of Manu.Narada was apparently acquainted with a work either identical\nwith, or closely allied to, the now extant Code of Manu. His analysis of the\ncontents of the original Code composed by Manu in 100,000 _s_ lokas\ncorresponds in the main to the topics\n\np. xiv\n\ntreated in that work as it now stands. He quotes the opening verse of the\noriginal gigantic work of Manu, and it is a remarkable coincidence that this\nverse agrees with Manu I, 5, 6, i.e. with the actual exordium of the Code of\nManu, as vv. 1-4 serve as an introduction only, and may be a subsequent\naddition. Forensic law is alleged to have formed the subject of the ninth\nchapter of the original composition of Manu. In the Code of Manu, law and\njudicature are discussed in the eighth and ninth chapters. The twenty-four\nchapters, divided into one thousand and eighty, i.e. 45 \xc3\x97 24 sections, of the\noriginal Code, seem to represent double the twelve chapters of the Code of\nManu. On the other hand, Sumati, the son of Bh _ri_ gu, who is alleged to have\nreduced the original Code of Manu to its present size, and to have produced\nthe law-book now current among mankind, may be identified with Bh _ri_ gu, the\nsupposed author of the actual Manu-sm _ri_ ti; and the number of 4,000 _s_\nlokas, which is assigned to his composition, may be taken to be a rough\nstatement of the actual extent of the Manu-sm _ri_ ti, which in reality runs\nup to 2,685 _s_ lokas only.\n\nA consideration of these facts leaves but little doubt that the compiler of\nthe Narada-sm _ri_ ti, whoever he was, must have been acquainted with a work\nclosely akin to the now extant Manu-sm _ri_ ti. This is so much the more\nprobable because several of his references to the authoritative enunciations\nof Manu may be actually traced to the Manu-sm _ri_ ti 1, and because a number\nof verses either occurring in the MSS. of the Narada-sm _ri_ ti, or attributed\nto him by the digest-writers, recur in the Code of Manu.\n\nHowever, though acquainted with the Code of Manu, the so-called Discrepancies\nbetween Manu and Narada.Narada was far from offering a mere slavish\nreproduction of its doctrines in his own work. On the contrary, the Narada-sm\n_ri_ ti must be considered as an independent, and therefore specially\nvaluable, exposition of the whole system of civil and criminal law, as taught\nin the law schools of the period. It is in fact the only Sm _ri_ ti,\ncompletely preserved\n\np. xv\n\nin MSS., in which law, properly so-called, is treated by itself, without any\nreference to rules of penance, diet, and other religious subjects; and it\nthrows a new and an important light on the political and social institutions\nof ancient India at the time of its composition. Several of the doctrines\npropounded by Narada arc decidedly opposed to, and cannot be viewed in the\nlight of developments from, the teaching of Manu. Thus e.g. Narada advocates\nthe practice of Niyoga, or appointment of a widow to raise offspring to her\ndeceased husband; he declares gambling to be a lawful amusement, when carried\non in public gaming-houses; he allows the remarriage of widows; he virtually\nabrogates the right of primogeniture by declaring that even the youngest son\nmay undertake the management of the family property, if specially qualified\nfor the task; he ordains that, in a partition of the family property, the\nfather may reserve two shares for himself, and that, in the case of a\npartition after his death, the mother shall divide equally with the sons, and\nan unmarried sister take the same share as a younger son; he lays down a\ndifferent gradation of fines from those laid down by Manu, &c. 1\n\nIt may be argued that Narada would not have ventured Their probable origin.to\ndiffer from the Code of Manu on such essential points as these, unless he had\nfound good authority for doing so in other early works or dicta attributed to\nthe primeval legislator of India, and that this fact furnishes another reason\nfor attaching some credit to what Narada relates of the original Code in\n100,000 verses, and of its successive abridgment. Thus much is certain, that a\ngreat many floating proverbs and authoritative enunciations of Manu and of V\n_ri_ ddha or B _ri_ han-Manu must have existed by the side of the Code of Manu\nin the times of Narada as well as before and after his period, when they were\nquoted in the Mahabharata 2 and in the Commentaries\n\np. xvi\n\nand Dharmanibandhas from Medhatithi's Manubhashya down to _G_ agannatha's\nDigest, translated by Colebrooke. The compiler of the Narada-sm _ri_ ti may\nhave incorporated a number of these dicta in his own composition. At the same\ntime, it is far from improbable that a work on law, called the Code of Manu in\nthe version of Narada, may have existed by the side of the celebrated Code of\nManu in the version of Bh _ri_ gu, and that the unknown compiler of the\nNarada-sm _ri_ ti may have utilised that work for his own composition, and\nenhanced the value and authority of the latter by referring to, and arranging\nin his own way, the reports current with regard to Manu and Narada. The\nprecise nature of the origin of such a work as the Narada-sm _ri_ ti must\nneeds remain a matter for speculation; but it certainly was an established\npractice with Sanskrit writers to graft their own compositions on earlier\nworks attributed to fabulous personages of the heroic age of India, and indeed\nto fabricate an authority of this kind for the productions of their own pen.\n\nThe probable date of the Code of Manu may be turned Date of the Narada-sm _ri_\nti.to account for determining the date of the Narada-sm _ri_ ti; just as the\npresumable date of the latter work has been used in its turn for fixing the\nchronological position of Manu. The composition of the two works is separated,\napparently, by a considerable interval of time. If, therefore, the date of\nManu has been rightly placed between the second centuries B.C. and A.D. by\nProfessor Buhler 1, it would seem to follow that the Narada-sm _ri_ ti can\nhardly belong to an earlier period than the fourth or fifth century A.D. The\nsame conclusion may be arrived at by other, and independent considerations.\n\nThus the Narada-sm _ri_ ti agrees on many important Compared with other Sm\n_ri_ tis,points, especially in the law of evidence, with the Dharma _s_ astras\nor Sm _ri_ tis of Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, Vish _n_ u, B _ri_ haspati, Katyayana,\nand Vyasa. It may be a little older than the three last-named works,\n\np. xvii\n\nwhich belong to the latest productions of the Sm _ri_ ti epoch of Hindu Law,\nbut its legal rules and judicial theories have a decidedly more advanced\ncharacter than either Vish _n_ u's or Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya's. The Sm _ri_ ti of\nVish _n_ u cannot belong to an earlier period than the third century A.D. 1,\nand the Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya Sm _ri_ ti is not likely to be anterior to it in\ndate 2.\n\nAgain, the judicial trial which is described in the well-known and with the\ndrama M _ri_ _k_ _kh_ aka _t_ ikadrama M _ri_ _k_ _kh_ aka _t_ ika corresponds\nin all essential features to the rules laid down in Narada's chapter on 'The\nPlaint 3.' If, then, the Naradiya Dharma _s_ astra and the M _ri_ _k_ _kh_ aka\n_t_ ika are contemporaneous productions, we have a further reason for\nassigning the composition of the former work to the fifth or sixth century\nA.D. It may also be noted that Narada (XII, 74) regards sexual intercourse\nwith a female ascetic, pravra _g_ ita, as a kind of incest. In the earlier\nIndian dramas likewise, such as Kalidasa's Malavikagnimitra and _S_ udraka's M\n_ri_ _k_ _kh_ aka _t_ ika, the position of nuns and monks is highly dignified.\n\nLast, not least, the European term Dinara, i.e. denarius The term Dinara.or\n\xce\xb4\xce\xb7\xce\xbd\xce\xac\xcf\x81\xce\xb9\xce\xbf\xce\xbd, which is so important for the purposes of Indian chronology, occurs\nrepeatedly in the Narada-sm _ri_ ti. In the first passage (Introd. II, 34, p.\n32), Dinaras are mentioned among other objects made of gold, and it would seem\nthat a gold coin used as an ornament is meant, such as e.g. the necklaces made\nof gold mohurs, which are being worn in India at the present day. 'A string of\nDinaras' (dinara-malaya) used as a necklace occurs in a well-known Jain work,\nthe Kalpa-sutra of Bhadrabahu 4. It is, however, possible that the 'Dinaras or\nother golden things' may be gold coins simply, and that Narada means to refer\nto forged or otherwise counterfeit coins. The second passage (Appendix v. 60,\np. 232) is specially valuable, because it contains an exact\n\np. xviii\n\nstatement of the value of a Dinara which, it says, is called a Suvar _n_ a\nalso. The reception of Dinaras among the ordinary coins of that period shows\nthat their circulation in India must have commenced some time before the\nNarada-sm _ri_ ti was written. The first importation of gold Dinaras into\nIndia cannot be referred to an earlier period than the time of the Roman\nemperors, and the gold Dinaras most numerously found in India belong to the\nthird century A.D. 1\n\nThe earliest reference to a work called Naradiya References to Narada.Dharma\n_s_ astra seems to be contained in a work of the sixth century, Ba _n_ a's\nKadambari 2. Whether the compiler of the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ atantra was acquainted\nwith the Narada-sm _ri_ ti appears to be doubtful. The Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ atantra in\nKosegarten's edition contains a legal text which is attributed to Narada,\nthough it is not to be found in the Narada-sm _ri_ ti. The standard Bombay\nedition of the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ atantra has that very text, but the name of Narada\nis omitted 3. Medhatithi's Manubhashya, which seems to belong to the ninth\ncentury, contains several references to the Narada-sm _ri_ ti, and Asahaya,\nwho appears to have preceded Medhatithi, is the reputed author of the ancient\nCommentary on it, which has largely been used for the present work 4.\n\nThese considerations tend to show that the composition Result.of the Narada-sm\n_ri_ ti cannot be referred to a more recent period than the fifth century\nA.D., or the sixth century at the very latest. Nor can it belong to a much\nearlier age than that. This estimate of its age agrees with the results\narrived at, thirteen years ago, from the very scanty data then available.\n\np. xix\n\nThe present translation, unlike the Institutes of Narada previously published\nby myself (London, Trubner & Co., 1876), The present translation.is based in\nthe main on what may be termed the large version of Narada, and accords\nthroughout with the editio princeps of the Narada-sm _ri_ ti in the\nBibliotheca Indica. The reasons which have induced me to consider the large\nversion as the original and authentic composition of Narada, and to make it\nthe basis of my edition of the Sanskrit text in the Bibliotheca Indica, have\nbeen stated in my volume of Tagore Law Lectures, pp. 54-56. In those parts of\nthe work also where both versions agree, or where the only extant MS. of the\nlarge version is deficient and has to be supplied from the MSS. of the minor\nversion, the present translation will be found to differ not inconsiderably\nfrom my previous rendering of the 'Institutes of Narada.' The discovery of\nfive valuable MSS. of the minor version, besides the three used in preparing\nthe 'Institutes of Narada,' the recovery of Asahaya's ancient and valuable\nCommentary on the Narada-sm _ri_ ti, and the dies diem docet have united to\nproduce a considerable number of new results. Among the new MSS. discovered,\nthe fifteenth-century Nepalese Palm-leaf MS. of Mr. Bendall is the most\nimportant, and has furnished an entire new chapter, the authenticity of which\nis proved by numerous references in the mediaeval and modern Digests of Law.\nThe chapter in question has been termed an Appendix in the present work (pp.\n[223](sbe3350.htm#page_223)-[232](sbe3350.htm#page_232)). It is found,\nlikewise, in a Nepalese paper MS. of the minor version, discovered very\nrecently by Mr. Bendall among the Nepalese MSS. of the British Museum, where\nit had been labelled wrongly as _K_ aurapratishedha.\n\nThe Commentary of Asahaya, as far as it goes, has Asahaya and Kalya _n_ abha\n_t_ _t_ a.furnished the substance of the foot-notes to the present\ntranslation, in which it has been quoted constantly as 'A.' Asahaya was a\nstandard writer in the province of Hindu Law, and his Naradabhashya is a very\nvaluable production indeed. He shares with other early commentators of law-\nbooks the peculiarity of indulging every now and then in illustrations\n\np. xx\n\ntaken from the every-day life of his period, which help to throw some light on\nthe practical working of Indian Law in those times. As an instance of this\ntendency I would cite his remarks on a rule concerning liability for debts\n(pp. [43](sbe3308.htm#page_43), [44](sbe3308.htm#page_44)). Of course it would\nbe dangerous to trust his philological skill everywhere, and some of his\ninterpretations are decidedly artificial. What is worse, the Commentary of\nAsahaya has not been preserved in its original shape, but in a recast due to\none Kalya _n_ abha _t_ _t_ a, whose name is entirely unknown to fame. It is\njust possible that Kalya _n_ abha _t_ _t_ a, instead of confining his activity\nto supplying deficiencies and correcting mistakes in the copies of Asahaya's\nCommentary, may have inserted some new verses in the text of the Narada-sm\n_ri_ ti as well. Such might be conjectured, for example, to be the origin of\nthe four verses, Introd. I, 21-24 (pp.\n[9](sbe3305.htm#page_9)-[13](sbe3305.htm#page_13)), which are quoted in none\nof the authoritative Digests, and objectionable as to grammar and metre. It\nshould be remembered, however, that Kalya _n_ abha _t_ _t_ a declares the\noriginal work of Asahaya to have been spoiled by negligent scribes, and so the\ngrammatical blunders may be charged to their account.\n\nThe latter half of Asahaya's Commentary being lost, I had to avail myself for\nthe corresponding portion of the Other auxiliary writings.Narada-sm _ri_ ti,\nof the glosses of other mediaeval writers, by whom the texts of Narada have\nbeen quoted and discussed a great deal. Their opinions have been adverted to\nvery fully, in the chapter on inheritance especially, both on account of the\npractical importance of inheritance for the law-courts of modern India, and\nbecause each of the various schools of Sanskrit lawyers has been anxious to\ninterpret the sayings of Narada to its own advantage. For the curious and\nsomewhat obscure disquisition on fourteen kinds of impotency (XII, 11-18, pp.\n[167](sbe3344.htm#page_167)-[169](sbe3344.htm#page_169)), I have been able to\nuse the advice of my late lamented friend Dr. Haas, the well-known student of\nIndian medical science. A somewhat analogous passage in the canonical\nliterature of the Buddhists has been kindly pointed out to me by Mr. Rhys\nDavids 1.\n\np. xxi\n\nThe sign of an asterisk (*) has been prefixed to those Narada's repute as a\nlegal writer.texts of Narada which were found to be quoted in one or several\nof the Sanskrit Commentaries or Digests of Law. The same method has been\nobserved previously in the Bibliotheca Indica edition of the Sanskrit text,\nbut a considerable number of quotations has come to light since then. The\nrepute of Narada as a legal writer appears to have been so great that upwards\nof half his work has been embodied in the authoritative compositions of the\nmediaeval and modern writers in the province of Sanskrit law.\n\nUnder the heading of Quotations from Narada, all those texts have been\ncollected at the close of the present translation 'Quotations from\nNarada.'which are attributed to Narada in one or several of the Digests and\nCommentaries, without being traceable in the MSS. of the Narada-sm _ri_ ti.\nBetween these quotations have been inserted, for the sake of completeness and\nin order to fill up the gaps between the single texts contained in the\nquotations, a number of unpublished texts from the MSS. of the minor version,\nand from the final chapter on Ordeals in the ancient Nepalese MS. of the\nNarada-sm _ri_ ti 1. A complete edition of that chapter will, I trust, be\npublished by Dr. A. Conrady. The quotations have been taken from all the\nprincipal Sanskrit works on law, from Medhatithi's Manubhashya downwards. For\na detailed statement of the particular work and chapter from which each text\nhas been quoted, I may refer to the foot-notes. Most texts being quoted in\nmore than one work at a time, it has not been thought necessary to give\ncomplete references to every such work in each particular case, but I have\nmade a point of referring as much as possible to those law-books which exist\nin English, both for convenience of reference and in order to facilitate a\ncomparison of the present translation with previous renderings of the texts of\nNarada. All the unpublished texts have been given in the foot-notes in the\noriginal Sanskrit, together with the names of the works from which they have\nbeen taken. The MSS.\n\np. xxii\n\nof these works were obtained principally from the India Office and Deccan\nCollege libraries; for some of them I was able to use copies of my own. A\npeculiar source of difficulties lies in the fact that these works differ\nconsiderably as to the names of the authors of the single texts. Many texts\nwere no doubt proverbial sayings, and appropriated therefore by several\nwriters. In other cases, the mutually conflicting statements of various\nwriters regarding the authorship of the texts may be attributed to\ncarelessness. Grammatical blunders and faulty readings, as well as the\nvarietas lectionis, have been referred to in important cases only. I subjoin a\nlist of the abbreviations used in the foot-notes to the present translation.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xii:1](sbe3302.htm#fr_0) Manu _t_ ikasa\xe1\xb9\x85graha, p. 39, gloss on Manu I, 58;\nBuhler, Sacred Books of the East, vol. xxv, p. xv.\n\n[xii:2](sbe3302.htm#fr_1) R Mandlik's Hindu Law, p. xlvii.\n\n[xii:3](sbe3302.htm#fr_2) Mahabharata XII, 59, 22, and 80 foll.; Buhler, ibid.\np. xcvi.\n\n[xiii:1](sbe3302.htm#fr_3) Forchhammer, The Jardine Prize Essay, pp. 54-58.\n\n[xiv:1](sbe3302.htm#fr_4) See e.g. Appendix 26 (p. 227) and Manu VIII, 320;\nAppendix 34 (p. 228) and Manu VIII, 334; Appendix 36, 37 (p. 228) and Manu\nVIII, 124, 125.\n\n[xv:1](sbe3302.htm#fr_5) See the foot-notes, passim.\n\n[xv:2](sbe3302.htm#fr_6) See Narada XII, 80-88, and Manu IX, 65-68; Narada\nXVII, 1-8, and Manu IX, 221-228; Narada XII, 97, and Manu V, 162; Narada XIII,\n5, and Manu IX, 105-209; Narada XIII, 13, 14, and Manu IX, 104, 131; Narada,\nAppendix 30, 31, and Manu VIII, 138.\n\n[xvi:1](sbe3302.htm#fr_7) Loc. cit. p. xcvii.\n\n[xvii:1](sbe3302.htm#fr_8) Sacred Books of the East, vol. vii, p. xxxii.\n\n[xvii:2](sbe3302.htm#fr_9) Tagore Law Lectures, p. 49.\n\n[xvii:3](sbe3302.htm#fr_10) See, particularly, [p. 27](sbe3306.htm#page_27),\nnote on 18.\n\n[xvii:4](sbe3302.htm#fr_11) See Dr. Jacobi's edition, par. 36 (p. 44), and the\nsame scholar's translation of the Kalpa-sutra, Sacred Books of the East, vol.\nxxii, p. 232.\n\n[xviii:1](sbe3302.htm#fr_12) Buhler, S.
