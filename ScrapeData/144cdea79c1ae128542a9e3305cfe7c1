Now there are twelve kinds of sons.\n\n2\\. The first is the son of the body, viz. he who is begotten (by the husband)\nhimself on his own lawfully wedded wife.\n\n3\\. The second is the soil begotten on a wife, viz. one begotten by a kinsman\nallied by funeral oblations, or[1] by a member of the highest caste, on an\nappointed (wife or widow).\n\n[XV. 1-29. M.

Of Chapters XV and XVII an excellent translation has been\npublished by Dr. Buhler in the Bombay Digest (1, 1 338-343). I have followed\nhim literally almost throughout.\n\n3\\. 1 I have translated the reading votpadita _h_ , which was no doubt\n{footnote p. 62} the reading of Nandapandita, as he paraphrases the whole\nclause as follows, \'begotten by an elder or younger brother of the husband; on\nfailure of such, by a kinsman allied by funeral oblations on failure of him,\nby one belonging to the same gotra (race) as the husband; on failure of him,\nby one descended from the same _Ri_ shi ancestors as he; on failure of him, by\na member of the highest caste, i. e. a Brahma _n_ a.\' The above reading is\nalso found in the London MS. of the text and in the two Calcutta editions. Dr.\nBuhler\'s MS., in which Nand.\'s Commentary on this chapter is wanting, has _k_\notpadita _h_ , and he translates accordingly, \'begotten by a kinsman . . .,\nwho belongs to the highest caste.\' The same reading is found in a quotation\ncontained in _G_ agannatha and Colebrooke\'s Dig. loc. cit. (I quote from a\nvery good though fragmentary Bengali MS. in my possession), where, however,\nthis clause runs as follows, niyuktaya _m_ savar _n_ ena _k_ otpadita _h_ ,\n\'begotten by a man of equal class on a widow duly appointed,\' Colebrooke. The\nother Sm _ri_ tis do not speak of the appointment of others than kinsmen to\nbeget a son on a widow, or wife of a eunuch, &c., unless Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya\'s\nwords (II, 128) sagotre _n_ etare _n_ a va, \'by a Sagotra or by another,\' may\nbe rendered, contrary to Vi _g_ \xc3\xb1ane _s_ vara\'s interpretation, by \'a kinsman\nor one who is no kinsman.\']\n\np. 62\n\n4\\. The third is the son of an appointed daughter.\n\n5\\. She is called an appointed daughter, who is given away by her father with\nthe words, \'The son whom she bears be mine.\'\n\n6\\. A damsel who has no brother is also (in every case considered) an\nappointed daughter, though she has not been given away according to the rule\nof an appointed daughter.\n\n7\\. The son of a twice-married woman is the fourth.\n\n8\\. She who, being still a virgin, is married for the second time is called\ntwice married (punarbhu).\n\n9\\. She also is called twice married (punarbhu) who, though not legally\nmarried more than once, has lived with another man before her lawful marriage.\n\np. 63\n\n10\\. The son of an unmarried damsel is the fifth.\n\n11\\. (He is called so who is) born by an unmarried daughter in the house of\nher father.\n\n12\\. And he belongs to the man who (afterwards) marries the mother.\n\n13\\. The son who is secretly born in the house is the sixth.\n\n14\\. He belongs to him in whose bed he is born.\n\n15\\. The son received with a bride is the seventh.\n\n16\\. He (is called so who) is the son of a woman married while she was\npregnant.\n\n17\\. And he belongs to the husband (of the pregnant bride).\n\n18\\. The adopted son (dattaka) is the eighth.\n\n19\\. And he belongs to him to whom he is given by his mother or father.\n\n20\\. The son bought is the ninth.\n\n21\\. And he belongs to him by whom he is bought.\n\n22\\. The son self-given is the tenth.\n\n23\\. And he belongs to him to whom he gave himself\n\n24\\. The son cast away is the eleventh.\n\n25\\. (He is called so) who was forsaken by his father or mother (or by both).\n\n26\\. And he belongs to him by whom he is received.\n\n27\\. The son born by any woman whomsoever[1] is the twelfth.\n\n[27. 1 Yatra kva _k_ anotpadita, \'born wherever,\' means, according to Nand.,\n\'begotten anyhow, but otherwise than the above-mentioned sons, upon a woman,\nwhether one\'s own wife, or another man\'s wife, whether equal in caste or not,\nwhether legally married to the {footnote p. 64} begetter or not, whether still\na virgin or not,\' &c. But he adds a very lengthy discussion, the upshot of\nwhich is, that the term yatra kva _k_ anotpadita is applicable to adopted sons\nonly, who, although they are considered as the sons of the adopter, or of the\nlegitimate husband of the woman, upon whom they were begotten by another, may\nalso become heirs to the begetter, in case he has no other son. \'Or this term\nrefers to the son of a _S_ udra concubine, whom Manu calls Para _s_ ava\' (M.\nIX, 178). The latter interpretation agrees with the one proposed by Dr.\nBuhler, who identifies the yatra kva _k_ anotpadita with the \'Nishada and Para\n_s_ ava of other lawyers,\' especially of Baudhayana (11, 2, 22), and with the\nview taken by _G_ agannatha, who thinks that the _S_ audra (son of a _S_ udra\nwoman) is meant.]\n\np. 64\n\n28\\. Amongst these (sons) each preceding one is preferable (to the one next in\norder).\n\n29\\. And he takes the inheritance (before the next in order).\n\n30\\. And let him maintain the rest.\n\n31\\. He should marry unmarried (sisters) in a manner correspondent with the\namount of his property.\n\n32\\. Outcasts, eunuchs, persons incurably diseased, or deficient (in organs of\nsense or actions, such as blind, deaf, dumb, or insane persons, or lepers) do\nnot receive a share.\n\n33\\. They, should be maintained by those who take the inheritance.\n\n34\\. And their legitimate sons receive a share.\n\n35\\. But not the children of an outcast;\n\n36\\. Provided they were born after (the commission of) the act on account of\nwhich the parents were outcasted.\n\n37\\. Neither do children begotten (by husbands of\n\n[32. \'The particle tu, "but," indicates that those who have entered the order\nof ascetics must also be understood here.\' (Nand.)\n\n34\\. \'The particle _k_ a indicates that sons begotten on their wives (Kshetra\n_g_ as) shall also receive a share.\' (Nand.)]\n\np. 65\n\nan inferior caste) on women of a higher caste receive a share,\n\n38\\. Their sons do not even receive a share of the wealth of their paternal\ngrandfathers.\n\n39\\. They should be supported by the heirs.\n\n40\\. And he who inherits the wealth, presents the funeral oblation (to the\ndeceased).\n\n41\\. Amongst wives of one husband also the son of one is the son of all (and\nmust present funeral oblations to them after their death).\n\n42\\. Likewise, amongst brothers begotten by, one (father, the son of one is\nthe son of all, and must present funeral oblations to them all).\n\n43\\. Let a son present the funeral oblations to his father, even though he\ninherit no property.\n\n44\\. Because he saves (trayate) his father from the hell called Put, therefore\n(a male child) is called put-tra (protector from Put, son) by Svayambhu\nhimself\n\n45\\. He (the father) throws his debt on him (the son); and the father obtains\nimmortality, if he sees the face of a loving son.\n\n46\\. Through a son he conquers the worlds. through a grandson he obtains\nimmortality, and through the soil\'s grandson he gains the world of the sun.\n\n47\\. No difference is made in this world between the son of a son and the son\nof a daughter; for even a daughter\'s son works the salvation of a childless\nman, just like a son\'s son.\n\n[44. \'Svayambhu means the Veda.\' (Nand.)]\n\np. 66\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XVI.](sbe07018.htm)\n\n'
