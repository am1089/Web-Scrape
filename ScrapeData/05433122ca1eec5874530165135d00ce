ORDEALS.\n\n1. 1 Let (the defendant) touch the heads of his sons, wife, or friends; or else the (ordeal by) sacred libation (may be performed), whatever the nature of the charge may be.\n\n2. 2 It is on the claimant that the duty of declaring his readiness to take on himself the penalty (to be awarded to the losing party) devolves in every case. Or the ordeal may be performed by either party at pleasure, the other party consenting to give the penalty (to be awarded in case of defeat).\n\n3. 3 To persons suspected by the king, or denounced (as criminals) by (intercourse with) robbers, or intent on their own justification, an ordeal must be administered without binding (an opponent) to give the penalty.\n\n4. 4 (The performance of) an ordeal is ordained in\n\np. 248\n\nimportant cases, when people are engaged in a controversy; an ordeal must not\nbe administered when there is no one ready to take the punishment on himself.\n\n5. 5 Justice is based on truth, and litigation (depends) on witnesses. When a case admits of divine test, human evidence (the testimony of witnesses) or documents must not be resorted to.\n\n6. 6 The (ordeal by) sacred libation has been declared by the wise to be applicable to all (castes), and poison (to all castes), excepting the Brahman (caste). (Either the balance is reserved for Brahmans), or the balance may be administered to (members of) every caste.\n\n7. 7 The (ordeal by) sacred libation may be administered in every case. The (ordeal by) balance is admissible in every season.\n\n8. 8 Eunuchs, distressed or feeble persons, the severely afflicted, infants, old men, women, and the blind should be tested by the balance always.\n\n9. 9 (The ordeal by) poison is not destined for\n\np. 249\n\nwomen, nor is (the ordeal by) water fit to be administered to them; it is\nthrough (the ordeals by) balance, sacred libation, and others that (the judge)\nmust explore the true state of their minds.\n\n10. 10 Let (the judge) test strong men by fire, water, or poison, and let him test infants, old or distressed men by the balance.\n\n11\\. Let (the judge) avoid (the ordeal by) fire in the case of lepers, (the\nordeal by) water in the case of the asthmatic, and (the ordeal by) poison in\nthe case of bilious or phlegmatic persons.\n\n12. 12 In the season of the rains, let the (ordeal by) fire be administered; also in the cold and chilly seasons. In the summer season, the (ordeal by) water is the proper (kind of ordeal). Poison (is destined) for the cold weather.\n\n13. 13 The chilly, cold, and rainy seasons are declared to be (the proper seasons) for the (ordeal by) fire; the autumn and summer seasons, for the (ordeal by) water; the (ordeal by) poison, (is fit) for the cold and chilly seasons.\n\n14. 14 The months of _K_ aitra (March-April), Marga _s_ irsha (November-December), and Vai _s_ akha (April-May)\n\np. 250\n\nare proper months for all (ordeals), and not adverse to any kind of ordeal.\n(Ordeals must) never (be administered) in the afternoon, nor in the twilight,\nnor at noon.\n\n15. 15 Ordeals administered at an improper place, or at an unsuitable time, or performed at a distance from human habitations, constitute a deviation from the proper course of a lawsuit, this is certain.\n\n16. 16 The chief judge must superintend the whole of the proceedings at an ordeal, fasting and obeying the king\'s instructions in the same way as an Adhvaryu (priest officiates) at a sacrifice.\n\n17. 17 The chief judge, who must be a Brahman, thoroughly versed in the Vedas and Veda\xe1\xb9\x85gas, instructed in sacred learning and of religious conduct, tranquil-minded, unambitious,\n\n18\\. Fond of veracity, pure, able, delighting in the welfare of all sentient\nbeings, having kept a fast, clad in his moist garments (after a bath), having\ncleansed his teeth, should worship all deities according to rule.\n\n19. 19 With red perfumes and garlands, as well as\n\np. 251\n\nwith curds, cakes of flour, fried grain and other (offerings), he should first\nworship the balance, and then show honour to the others.\n\n20. 20 The balance and the other ordeals ordained by the sages should be administered by the king by consent of the claimant, but not otherwise.\n\n21\\. When they are performed otherwise (the claimant not giving his consent),\nhe incurs the same guilt as a thief.\n\n22. 22 I will state next the excellent rule regarding the (ordeal by) balance, as the king and the chief judge should administer that ordeal to a man (arraigned in a cause).\n\n23. 23 The two posts supporting the beam of the balance should measure four Hastas above ground, their (entire) length should be six Hastas.\n\n24. 24 The king should cause a wooden beam of the balance to be made, which must be four Hastas long,\n\np. 252\n\npolished, furnished with the. required characteristics, and having the two\nscales suspended by both extremities.\n\n25\\. After having caused two posts to be erected, on even ground, which must\nbe placed from north to south, and must be arranged both in one line, he shall\ncause the beam of the balance to be fastened across (the transverse beam which\nconnects) them.\n\n26\\. With an iron cord let a virtuous man surround the beam in the middle and\nfasten it in an east-western direction, after having carefully connected it\n(with the transverse beam).\n\n27. 27 The (appointed) examiners have to take care always that the two perpendiculars of the balance should be equal in length. Water must be poured out on (the beam of) the balance by skilled persons.\n\n28\\. If the water does not trickle down (from the balance), the balance may be\nconsidered as being level.\n\n29. 29 With red perfumes and garlands, as well as with curds, cakes of flour, fried grain and other (offerings, the judge) should first worship the balance, and then show honour to the others.\n\np. 253\n\n30. 30 (The person accused being about to be placed in the scale for the second time, the judge should address the balance as follows): \'Thou, O Balance, hast been created by Brahman, to test the wicked. On account of the syllable dha thou art the image of Dharma (Justice), on account of the syllable _t_ a, thou\n\n31\\. Being used for balancing (dh _ri_ ta, in this ordeal) discoverest the\nvicious. Therefore thou art called dha _t_ a (balance).\'\n\n32. 32 If (the person) remains level (sama), he is considered to be in a middling position (samata). If he comes down, he loses his cause. He who goes down is not innocent; he is innocent who goes up.\n\n33\\. He who remains level is also not acquitted. These are the three possible\ncases in the (ordeal by) balance. Thus has been declared the never-failing\nacquittal (obtainable) through the test by balance.\n\n34. 34 When (the scales fixed) at the two extremities of the beam have been moved, when the mark which had been made has come off, when (the balance) is going up and down, being agitated by wind,\n\n35\\. Or when (the man appointed to hold it) lets it\n\np. 254\n\ngo all of a sudden: (in all these cases) the matter in dispute must not be\ndecided either way.\n\n36. 36 Now then I will proclaim the excellent rule regarding the (ordeal by) fire, as it has been declared (by the sages). The intermediate space between two circles is ordained to measure thirty-two A\xe1\xb9\x85gulas.\n\n37. 37 The seven circles are thus declared by persons thoroughly conversant with the art of computation to cover a space of two hundred and twenty-four A\xe1\xb9\x85gulas.\n\n38. 38 Let the peculiar signs be marked which he has on both hands, both visible and invisible ones, whether caused by a scar or not caused by a scar.\n\n39. 39 After having first marked in this way the hands of the person accused, he should offer clarified butter in fire according to rule, as a propitiatory rite, reciting Mantras (at the same time).\n\np. 255\n\n40\\. The gods and the guardian deities of the world having been hospitably\nentertained, let (the person accused) utter the following prayer, facing the\nsun.\n\n41\\. \xc2\x91Thou, O fire, dwellest in the interior of all deities as a flame. Thou\nconveyest burnt-oblations to the gods, and givest peace of mind.\n\n42\\. \xc2\x91Thou, O God, knowest the secret offences and merits of men. Thou, O\ndeity, knowest whatever mortals do not comprehend.\n\n43\\. \xc2\x91Arraigned in a cause, I am about to be tested by fire. Therefore deign\nto deliver me lawfully from the perplexity in which I am involved.\xc2\x92\n\n44\\. The man (about to be examined) having made this speech, facing the east,\nwith firmness, his joined hands should be covered with seven equal leaves of\nthe holy fig-tree,\n\n45. 45 And both hands should be tied with seven strings of light-coloured thread.\n\n46. 46 (Then the man) should take a smooth ball of red-hot iron, fifty Palas in weight, in both hands, and step gradually across the seven circles.\n\n47. 47 When a man has carefully stepped through\n\np. 256\n\nthe (seven) circles in this way, without having burnt himself in the least, he\nis acquitted.\n\n48. 48 When he has dropped the ball, his hands should be inspected. If the marks have retained their previous appearance, he should examine (the hands) elsewhere as well.\n\n49\\. When a bloodshot round stain or any other sore caused by fire is seen,\nthe man has to be considered as guilty, because truth and virtue are not found\nin him.\n\n50. 50 I will proclaim next the excellent rule regarding the (ordeal by) water. Let a king who is desirous of establishing perfect truth refrain from administering (this ordeal) in winter.\n\n51. 51 With perfumes, garlands, sweet-smelling substances, honey, milk, clarified butter, and the like, let (the judge) perform the worship of Varu _n_ a (the deity of water) first of all.\n\n52. 52 Let (the judge) cause this ordeal to be performed\n\np. 257\n\nin transparent and very cool water, which does not contain aquatic animals or\nmud, and is abundant and not too shallow.\n\n53. 53 Let (a man) go near the bank of the water (in which the accused is to be immersed) and erect an arch as high as the ear (of the person) on the edge (of that water), on level and purified ground.\n\n54. 54 A strong bow should be known to have seven hundred; one not particularly strong, six hundred; a weak bow, five hundred. Thus has the rule regarding the bow been declared.\n\n55. 55 From a bow of a middling quality let a skilful (archer) discharge three arrows, after having made a target one hundred and fifty Hastas distant.\n\n56. 56 (The archer) is blameable if the arrows discharged by him fall short of or go beyond the target. (The person accused) obtains acquittal if his body continues immersed in water after the middling arrow has been (discharged and) brought back.\n\np. 258\n\n57. 57 Among fifty runners, those two who are the quickest runners should be appointed to fetch the arrow.\n\n58. 58 Let a strong man, who may be a Brahman, Kshatriya or Vai _s_ ya, and must be free from affection and hatred, be placed in water reaching his navel, (standing erect) like a pillar.\n\n59. 59 (The accused), thoroughly controlled in mind, shall seize the thighs of that man under water, and stand in it composed all the time till the (runner) appointed to fetch (the arrow) has returned.\n\n60. 60 Then let men strictly devoted to veracity and virtue, acquainted with the application of legal rules, and free from affection and hatred, see that everything is fair.\n\n61. 61 An intelligent, pious-minded man should descend into the water and duly address (the deity of water) with the following auspicious texts.\n\n61 b. The sacred prayer (runs as follows). \xc2\x91Om, adoration to Justice.\n\n62. 62 \xc2\x91Thou, O lord of waters, who art so pleasantly\n\np. 259\n\ncool, art the source of (all) beings. Save this man from guilt, thou knowest\nboth good and evil.\n\n63. 63 \xc2\x91Thou art the first of the gods and the great comforter of the world. Thou, O water, dwellest in the interior of all beings, like a witness.\n\n64. 64 \xc2\x91Thou, O deity, alone knowest what mortals do not understand. This man, being arraigned in a cause, is going to dive in thee. Therefore deign to deliver him lawfully from this perplexity.\xc2\x92\n\n65. 65 Then (the accused) should submerge all his limbs in water so as to become invisible.\n\n66. 66 A prudent man should leave the water, after having seen the arrow brought back, and should approach the king and all the assessors of the court, after saluting them reverentially.\n\n67. 67 Though only his ear, eye, mouth or nose should become visible while he is in water, he cannot be acquitted. If he remains invisible, he obtains acquittal.\n\np. 260\n\n68. 68 Now then I will proclaim the excellent rule regarding the (ordeal by) poison, (stating) how the king should give poison, the best means of purification for a man.\n\n69. 69 Let him give the poison in the presence of (images of) the deities and Brahmans, after having kept a fast and worshipped Mahe _s_ vara with incense, offerings, and sacred texts.\n\n70. 70 (The judge) should give the poison with fixed attention, facing the north or the east, in the presence of Brahmans, (while the accused) is facing the south.\n\n71. 71 Let seven Yavas be given, as a test of innocence, without doubt, of poison from the _S_ _ri_ \xe1\xb9\x85ga tree or Vatsanabha (poison) or Hima _g_ a poison.\n\n72. 72 In the morning and in a cool place let the poison be given to all persons, after it has been finely ground, and mixed with clarified butter thirty times the quantity.\n\n73. 73 He must not give poison to infants, disabled or superannuated persons, or to those who have committed a very light offence only, or to a madman, to one severely afflicted, to a cripple, or to ascetics.\n\n74. 74 If the person (examined) undergoes no change\n\np. 261\n\nof appearance during the time occupied by clapping the hands five hundred\ntimes, he is acquitted, and should be cured (by giving him antidotes of\npoison).\n\n75. 75 \xc2\x91On account of thy poisonous and dangerous nature thou art hard on all persons. Thou art appointed to show the difference between good and evil like a witness.\n\n76. 76 \xc2\x91Thou, O deity, knowest the sacred ordinances and the conduct of men, both good and evil actions, (in short) whatever men do not comprehend.\n\n77. 77 \xc2\x91This man being arraigned in a cause, wishes to obtain acquittal. Therefore deign to deliver him lawfully from this perplexity.\xc2\x92\n\n78. 78 This prayer should be pronounced according to rule, while the poison is being swallowed (by the person).\n\n79. 79 The king having known the man to be innocent should honourably dismiss him, and proclaim him (innocent) with a loud voice. Thus has the law been laid down.\n\n80. 80 (Let the ordeal by sacred libation be administered) to one who consents to it and puts faith (in\n\np. 262\n\nreligion) in the presence of the deities and Brahmans.\n\n81. 81 Having called near the person accused, (the judge) should place him inside the circle and cause him to swallow three handsful of water, after having caused him to face the sun.\n\n82. 82 After having worshipped that deity (to which the accused is devoted, the judge) should wash (the image of that deity) with water, proclaim his crime, and cause him to swallow the three handsful of water.\n\n83. 83 When some one drinks consecrated water of his own accord, after having been charged with a crime, and does not confess his guilt, actuated by avarice, such a wicked man will become a leper (in a future birth).\n\n84. 84 When a man tells a lie knowingly and intentionally, after having drunk consecrated water, he is born as a poor, sick, or foolish person in seven (successive) existences.\n\n85\\. When a man administers the (ordeal by) sacred libation by force to\nprocure some advantage to himself, it will destroy himself, nor will his\naffairs prosper.\n\n86. 86 When a man has been convicted (by this\n\np. 263\n\nordeal) he may be compelled by his creditor himself to repay the debt proved\nagainst him, and the king may exact from him with justice a fine amounting to\ntwice as much as the debt.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[247:1](sbe3356.htm#fr_758) VI, 1.

The\nMitakshara explains the term _s_ ira _h_ or _s_ irsha, which has been\ntranslated by \'penalty\' in this paragraph and in the preceding text, as\ndenoting the head, i.e. the fourth or principal division of a lawsuit, which\ninvolves defeat or success, and results in the awarding of a punishment or\nfine to the losing party. It appears more probable, however, that _s_ iras,\n\'head,\' is an equivalent for \'life,\' the accuser having to declare his\nreadiness to risk his life, i.e. a heavy punishment, in case of defeat.\n\n[247:4](sbe3356.htm#fr_761) Sm _ri_ ti _k_. kara _n_ e mahati prokta _m_ divya\n_m_ vadarthina _m_ n _ri_ _n_ am | _s_ irovarti yada na syat tada divya _m_ na\ndiyate || This is apparently the p. 248 correct reading of the text translated\nabove, Narada I, 19, 257 (pp. [101](sbe3326.htm#page_101),\n[102](sbe3326.htm#page_102)).\n\n[248:5](sbe3356.htm#fr_762) M. Macn. X, 1, 7. In actions for debt and the\nlike, though witnesses possessing the required qualifications (such as\nveracity, &c.) should have been adduced by the plaintiff, an ordeal may be\nadministered, if the defendant proposes an ordeal and promises to give the\nfine or other penalty to be inflicted in case of his being defeated, because\nwitnesses are subject to the fault of partiality, whereas an ordeal shows the\ntrue state of the case, as no fault can be found with it, and is an emblem of\njustice.

Viram. p. 235. In the third Pada of 8, I\nread balav _ri_ ddhastriyo\xe0\xa4\xbdndha _m_ _s_ _k_ a with Sm _ri_ ti _k_. for balav\n_ri_ ddhaturan stri _s_ _k_ a p. 249 (Viram., _T_ o _d_.), as the term atura\noccurs twice under the latter reading.\n\n[248:9](sbe3356.htm#fr_766) M. Macn. X, I, 12 (uncertain); Nepalese Narada.\n\n[249:10](sbe3356.htm#fr_767) 10, 11. Minor Narada I, 5, 116, 118 (p. 46). For\nthe Sanskrit, see Narada-sm _ri_ ti, p. 112, note. Nearly identical with a\ntext usually attributed to Pitamaha, Viram. p. 237.\n\n[249:12](sbe3356.htm#fr_768) Viram. pp. 239, 240. Nearly identical with Narada\nI, 19, 254 (p. 101) and Minor Narada I, 5, 113, 114 (p. 46).\n\n[249:13](sbe3356.htm#fr_769) 13, 14 a. V. T.; M. Macn. X, 1, 10 (uncertain).\nThese two texts are elsewhere attributed to Pitamaha, and it is certainly\ndifficult to reconcile them with 12.\n\n[249:14](sbe3356.htm#fr_770) 14 b. Viram. p. 240. In the quotations, this text\ncomes after p. 250 Narada I, 19, 259 (above, p. [102](sbe3326.htm#page_102)).\n\'The prohibition to administer an ordeal at noon has reference to ordeals\nother than the ordeal by water.\' Viram.\n\n[250:15](sbe3356.htm#fr_771) Viram. p. 241; May. p. 18 (text). I read\nbahirvasak _ri_ tani in the second Pada (bahirvadik _ri_ tani, May.), and\nvyabhi _k_ ara _m_ sadartheshu in the third Pada (vyabhi _k_ are sadartheshu,\nViram.). \'At a distance from human habitations,\' in solitude.

I read kuryad in 18, as in Mitakshara, Vivadata _n_ _d_ ava, &c.\n(k _ri_ tva, Viram.). These texts, although generally quoted in the section on\nthe ordeal by balance, seem to contain a rule applicable to every ordeal.\n\n[250:19](sbe3356.htm#fr_774) M. Macn. X, 2, 17, &c. This text is supposed to\napply to p. 251 a judge who is about to administer the ordeal by balance to\none arraigned in a cause. The term \'the others\' is said to relate to Indra and\nthe other deities.\n\n[251:20](sbe3356.htm#fr_775) 20, 21. Minor Narada I, 5, 112, 113 (pp.\n[45](sbe3308.htm#page_45), [46](sbe3308.htm#page_46)).
