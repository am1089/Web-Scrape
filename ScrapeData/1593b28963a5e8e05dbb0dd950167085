When (eating) is taking place, (the pra _n_ agnihotra has to be\nperformed) from that (i.e. the food first eaten); on the ground of the passage\ndeclaring this.\n\nWhen eating is actually taking place, 'from that,' i.e. with that material of\nfood which first presents itself, the agnihotra offered to the pra _n_ as is\nto be effected.--On what\n\np. 251\n\nground?--' On the ground of the passage declaring this.' For the clause, 'The\nfirst food which a man may take is in the place of a homa,' enjoins the\ncircumstance of the oblations to the pra _n_ as being effected by means of a\nmaterial (primarily) subserving another purpose (viz. eating), as appears from\nits referring to the presentation of food as something accomplished (i.e.\naccomplished independently of the oblations; not tending to accomplish the\noblations). How then should these oblations--which are characterised as not\nhaving any motive power with regard to the employment of the food--be capable\nof causing us to substitute, in the absence of eating, some other material\n(than food)?--Nor is it true that there are already established, for the pra\n_n_ agnihotra, all the details belonging to the fundamental agnihotra. In the\ncase of the ayana of the Ku _n_ _d_ apayins, the term 'agnihotra' forms part\nof the injunctive passage, 'They offer the agnihotra during a month,' and\ntherefore may have the force of enjoining a general character of the sacrifice\nidentical with that of the fundamental agnihotra; and it is therefore\nappropriate to consider the details of the latter as valid for the agnihotra\nof the Ku _n_ _d_ apayins also. In the case of the so-called pra _n_\nagnihotra, on the other hand, the term 'agnihotra' occurs in an arthavada-\npassage only, and does not therefore possess an analogous injunctive force.\nIf, again, we admitted that the details of the fundamental agnihotra are valid\nfor the pra _n_ agnihotra also, such details as the transference of the fire\n(from the garhapatya fire to the two other fires) would be likewise valid. But\nthis is impossible, as the transference of the fire is made for the purpose of\nestablishing a fireplace in which the oblations are made; in our case, on the\nother hand, the oblations are not made in the fire at all--because that would\ninterfere with their being used as food, and because they are connected with a\nmaterial procured for the purpose of eating,--but are made in the mouth (of\nthe eater). Thus the text of the _G_ abalas also, 'He is to eat before the\nguests,' shows that the accomplishment of the oblation has the mouth for its\nabode. For the same reason (i.e. because the details of the fundamental\nagnihotra are\n\np. 252\n\nnot valid for the pra _n_ agnihotra) the text declares the subordinate members\nof the agnihotra to be present here (i.e. in the pra _n_ agnihotra) in the way\nof fanciful combination only, 'the chest is the vedi, the hairs the\nsacrificial grass, the heart the Garhapatya fire, the mind the Anvaharyapa _k_\nana fire, the mouth the \xc3\x82havaniya fire.' By the vedi mentioned in this passage\nwe have to understand a levelled spot, as in the fundamental agnihotra there\nis no vedi, and as the intention of the passage is to effect a fanciful\ncombination of the members of the fundamental agnihotra (with members of the\npra _n_ agnihotra).--And as the pra _n_ agnihotra is connected with eating\nwhich has its definite times, it is also not possible that it should be\nrestricted to the time enjoined for the fundamental agnihotra. In the same way\nother particulars also of the fundamental agnihotra, such as the so-called\nupasthana, cannot be reconciled with the requirements of the pra _n_\nagnihotra. From all this it follows that the five oblations, as connected with\ntheir respective mantras, materials, and divinities, have to be performed only\nin the case of food being eaten.--With reference to the passage showing\n'respect,' we remark that it is meant to intimate priority (of the host), in\nthe case of food being actually eaten. But the passage has no power to declare\nthat the offering of the pra _n_ agnihotra is of permanent obligation.--It\ntherefore is a settled conclusion that the pra _n_ agnihotra is omitted when\nthe eating of food is omitted.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 42](sbe38185.htm)\n\n"
