Verily, by means of the Great Oblation the gods slew V _ri_ tra; by\nit they gained that supreme authority which they now wield. Now whichever of\nthem were hit by (the Asuras') arrows in that battle, those same darts they\nextracted, those they pulled out, by performing the Tryambaka-offerings.\n\n2:6:2:22\\. And, accordingly, when he performs those offerings, he either does\nso hoping that thus no arrow\n\np. 438\n\n[paragraph continues] (misfortune) will hit any of his, or because the gods\ndid so. And thereby he delivers from Rudra's power both the descendants that\nare born unto him and those that are unborn; and his offspring is brought\nforth without disease and blemish. This is why he performs these offerings.\n\n2:6:2:33\\. They are (offered) to Rudra: Rudra's, indeed, is the dart; and\nhence (these offerings) belong to Rudra. They consist of (cakes) on one\npotsherd: 'To one deity they shall belong!' so (he thinks, and) therefore they\nconsist of (cakes) on one potsherd.\n\n2:6:2:44\\. There is one for each individual,--as many as he has descendants,--\nexceeded by one. (There being) one for each individual, he thereby delivers\nfrom Rudra's power the descendants that are born unto him; and there being an\nadditional one, he thereby delivers from Rudra's power the descendants that\nare not yet born to him: this is why there are (as many cakes as there are\ndescendants) exceeded by one.\n\n2:6:2:55\\. He takes out (the rice for) those (cakes), while seated behind the\nGarhapatya, sacrificially invested and facing the north. From thence he rises\nand threshes (the rice), while standing with his face towards the north. He\nplaces the two mill-stones on (the black antelope skin, so as to incline)\ntowards the north; and puts the potsherds on the north side of the Garhapatya\nhearth. As to why they keep the northern quarter,--that indeed is the quarter\nof that god (Rudra), and hence they keep the northern quarter.\n\n2:6:2:66\\. They (the cakes) may be anointed (with ghee),--for the havis is\nanointed 1;--but let them rather be\n\np. 439\n\nunanointed; for, indeed, Rudra would be hankering after the (sacrificer's)\ncattle, if he were to anoint (the cakes): let them therefore be unanointed.\n\n2:6:2:77\\. Having removed all (the cakes from the potsherds) into one dish,\nand taken a fire-brand from the Dakshi _n_ a-fire, he walks aside towards the\nnorth--for that is the region of that god--and offers. He offers on a road,--\nfor on roads that god roves; he offers on a cross-road,--for the cross-road,\nindeed, is known to be his (Rudra's) favourite haunt 1. This is why he offers\non a cross-road.\n\n2:6:2:88\\. He offers with the central leaflet of a pala _s_ a-leaf. The pala\n_s_ a-leaf, truly, is the Brahman (priesthood) 2: with the Brahman, therefore,\nhe offers. He takes a cutting from (the northern part of) all the cakes; from\nthe additional one alone he takes no cutting.\n\np. 440\n\n2:6:2:99\\. He offers 1, with the text (Va _g_. S. III, 57 a), 'This is thy\nshare, O Rudra! graciously accept it together with thy sister Ambika! Svaha!'\nAmbika 2, indeed, is the name of his (Rudra's) sister; and this share belongs\nto him conjointly with her; and because that share belongs to him conjointly\nwith a woman (stri), therefore (these oblations) are called Tryambaka _h_.\nThereby, then, he delivers from Rudra's power the descendants that have been\nborn unto him.\n\n2:6:2:1010\\. Now as to that additional (cake),--he buries it in a mole-hill 3,\nwith the text (Va _g_. S. III, 57 b), 'This is thy share, O Rudra! the mole is\nthy animal (victim).' He thus assigns to him the mole as the only animal 4,\nand he (Rudra) does not therefore injure any other animal. Then as to why he\nburies (the cake): concealed, indeed, are embryos, and concealed also is what\nis buried,--that is why he buries it. By this (offering) he delivers from the\npower of Rudra those descendants of his, that are not yet born.\n\np. 441\n\n2:6:2:1111\\. Thereupon they return (to the fire) and mutter (Va _g_. S. III,\n58, 59), 'We have satisfied the claims of Rudra, satisfied the divine\nTryambaka, that he may make us richer, that he may make us more prosperous,\nthat he may render us steady in our purpose.--Thou (O Rudra) art a remedy for\nthe cow, a remedy for the horse, a remedy for man; a blessing for the ram and\nthe ewe.' This is the prayer for blessing at this performance.\n\n2:6:2:1212\\. They then walk thrice round the altar not sun-wise, beating their\nleft thighs (with the right hand), with the text (Va _g_. S. III, 60 a), 'We\nworship Tryambaka, the fragrant increaser of prosperity. Even as a gourd (is\nsevered) from its stem, so may I be severed from death, not from immortality!'\nThis is the prayer for blessing at this performance: thereby they invoke a\nblessing (upon the Sacrificer), for verily blessed is he who shall be severed\nfrom death, not from immortality. That is why he says, 'May I be severed from\ndeath, not from immortality.'\n\n2:6:2:1313\\. Let the maidens then also walk round, thinking, 'May we enjoy\nprosperity!' That sister of Rudra, named Ambika, indeed is the dispenser of\nhappiness: hence the maidens also should walk round, thinking, 'May we enjoy\nprosperity!'\n\n2:6:2:1414\\. The text (prescribed) for them is (Va _g_. S. III, 60 b), 'We\nworship Tryambaka, the fragrant bestower of husbands. Even as a gourd (is\nsevered) from its stem, so may I be severed from this. (world), not from\nthence (yonder world)!' By saying 'from this,' she means to say 'from my\nrelatives;' and by saying 'not from thence,' she means to say 'not from\nhusbands.' Husbands, doubtless, are the support of woman: hence she says 'not\nfrom thence.'\n\np. 442\n\n2:6:2:1515\\. Then they (the Sacrificer and priests) again walk round thrice\nsunwise, beating their right thighs, with the same text. As to why they again\nwalk round thrice sunwise,--they think, 'Sunwise this sacred work of ours\nshall be accomplished,' and therefore they again walk thrice round sunwise.\n\n2:6:2:1616\\. The Sacrificer now takes those (remains of the cakes) into his\njoined palms and throws them upwards higher than a cow can reach 1. Thereby\nthey cut out his (Rudra's) darts from their bodies. If they fail to catch them\n2, they touch (those that have fallen to the ground). Thereby they make them\nmedicine, and hence, if they fail to catch them, they touch them.\n\n2:6:2:1717\\. Having then packed them into two net-work baskets and tied them\nto the two ends of either a bamboo staff or the beam of a balance, he steps\n\np. 443\n\naside towards the north; and if he meets with a tree or a stake or a bamboo or\nan ant-hill, he fastens them thereon, with the text (Va _g_. S. III, 61),\n'These, O Rudra, are thy provisions; therewith depart beyond the Mu _g_\navats!'--(supplied) with provisions people indeed set out on a journey: hence\nhe thereby dismisses him supplied with provisions whithersoever he is bound.\nNow in this case his journey is beyond the Mu _g_ avats: hence he says,\n'Depart beyond the Mu _g_ avats!'--'with thy bow unstrung and muffled up--,'\nwhereby he means to say, 'Depart propitious, not injuring us 1;' 'Clad in a\nskin,'--whereby he lulls him to sleep 2; for while sleeping he injures no one:\nhence he says, 'Clad in a skin.'\n\n2:6:2:1818\\. They then turn to the right about, and return (to the uttaravedi)\nwithout looking back. Having returned thither, they touch water; for they have\nbeen performing a ceremony relating to Rudra 3, and water is (a means of)\npurification: with water, that (means of) purification, they accordingly\npurify themselves.\n\n2:6:2:1919\\. Thereupon he shaves his hair and beard, and takes up the fire (of\nthe uttaravedi),--for only after changing his place (to the ordinary\nsacrificial ground) he performs the (Full-moon) sacrifice on that fire, since\nit is not proper that he should perform the\n\np. 444\n\n[paragraph continues] Agnihotra on the uttaravedi: for this reason he changes\nhis place. Having gone to the house, and 'churned out' the fires\n[1](sbe1262.htm#fn_994), he performs the Full-moon offering. The Seasonal\nofferings, doubtless, are detached sacrifices; whereas the Full-moon offering\nis a regular, established sacrifice: hence he finally establishes himself by\nmeans of that regular sacrifice, and therefore changes his place (to the\nordinary sacrificial ground).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[438:1](sbe1261.htm#fr_986) This refers to the so-called pra _n_ adana, or\n'bestowal of life p. 439 (or soul),' that is, the anointing of the sacrificial\ndishes with ghee, previously to their being placed on the altar. The anointing\ntakes place with the text (Va _g_. S. ed. p. 35), 'That life (or soul, pra _n_\na) of thine which has entered into the cattle, and becomes diffused through\nthe various forms of the gods,--endowed with (that) life (atmanvan)--for thou\nart laden with ghee--go to Agni, O Soma! and obtain bliss (svar) for the\nSacrificer!' Katy. II, 8, 14. At the new and full-moon sacrifice, this\nceremony is not even alluded to in our Brahma _n_ a, either in this or the Ka\n_n_ va recension. See I, 3, 4, 16. The Ka _n_ va text reads, 'They may be\nanointed,' so they say, &c.\n\n[439:1](sbe1261.htm#fr_987) 'He offers on a cross-road, for such is the\nhalting-place (pa _d_ bi _s_ a) of the Agnis,' Taitt. Br. I, 6, 10, 3.\n\n[439:2](sbe1261.htm#fr_988) 'The central leaflet of the pala _s_ a-leaf is the\nBrahman,' Ka _n_ va text. The leaf of the pala _s_ a (Butea Frondosa) consists\nof three leaflets,--leathery, above shining and pretty smooth, and below\nslightly hoary; the central (or terminal) one being obovate and considerably\nlarger than the lateral ones (which, according to Roxburgh, Flora Ind., III,\np. 244, are from 4 to 6 inches long, and from 3 to 4\xc2\xbd broad). 'Pala _s_ a _s_\nakhayam yani tri _n_ i par _n_ ani tatra madhyamam par _n_ am pra _s_ astaya\nsrugrupam,' Say. on Taitt. S. I, 8, 6.\n\n[440:1](sbe1261.htm#fr_989) He consecrates, by the usual fivefold lustration,\nsome spot on a cross-way, to the north of the sacrificial ground, and after\nlaying down the fire-brand taken from the Dakshi _n_ agni, he offers thereon,\nusing the central leaflet of a pala _s_ a-leaf as the offering-spoon.\n\n[440:2](sbe1261.htm#fr_990) In Taitt. Br. I, 6, 10, 4, this sister of Rudra is\nidentified with the autumn, wherewith the god is wont to kill (viz. by means\nof catarrh, fever, &c., Say.). See also Weber, Ind. Stud. I, 183; Muir,\nOriginal Sanskrit Texts, vol. iv. p. 321.\n\n[440:3](sbe1261.htm#fr_991) '\xc3\x82khutkara;' 'akhukarisha,' Ka _n_ va text.\nPossibly a mouse-hole, or the earth thrown up by a mouse, is meant. See [p.\n278](sbe1240.htm#page_278), note [3](sbe1240.htm#fn_641). Cf. Taitt. Br. I,\n6,10, 2: 'N.N. is thy victim,' thus saying, let him indicate the one he (the\nSacrificer) hates; thereby he delivers over to him (Rudra) the one he hates.\nIf he hate no one, let him say, 'the mole (mouse) is thy victim.'\n\n[440:4](sbe1261.htm#fr_992) 'Thus he makes over to him only the mole as\nvictim, and puts it into his mouth,' Ka _n_ va text.\n\n[442:1](sbe1261.htm#fr_993) 'Yatha gaur nodapnuyat' 'Yavad gaur nodapnuyat\ntavat,' Ka _n_ va text. Saya _n_ a takes go to mean 'earth,' and interprets,\n'in such a way that the earth does not obtain it (i.e. that they do not fall\nto the ground).' Katy. prescribes, V, 10, 18, The Sacrificer, with his joined\nopen hands, throws the Rudra-cakes upwards as high as not to be reachable by a\ncow (ago _h_ prapa _n_ am); 19, He catches them; 20, If they cannot be\n(caught), then touching (of those that have fallen on the ground).\n\n[442:2](sbe1261.htm#fr_994) I adopt (not without reluctance) Saya _n_ a's\ninterpretation of vilipsanta _h_ (= labdhum a _s_ akta _h_ ), which seems to\nbe that of Katyayana also. The St. Petersburg Dict. takes it in the sense of\n(if they are) desirous of distributing them.' Taitt. Br. I, 6, 10, 5 has\nmerely utkiranti bhagasya lipsante,' 'they throw (them) up, (whereby) they\ndesire to obtain prosperity.' \xc3\x82pastamba, as quoted by Say. on Taitt. S. I, 8,\n6, says,--Having thrown up the cakes and caught them again (pratilabhya), and\nhaving, with 'We worship Tryambaka,' put them into the Sacrificer's joined\npalms; and having taken them up separately (? apadaya), with (or thinking) 'We\ndesire to obtain you of (? from) Bhaga;' let them put them together\n(samavapeyu _h_ ) thrice in this way.\n\n[443:1](sbe1261.htm#fr_995) In the Va _g_. Sa _m_ hita this forms part of the\ntext, but it is clearly a gloss taken from the Brahma _n_ a. The Ka _n_ va\nrecension of the Brahma _n_ a has '--pinakavasa ity ahi _m_ san na _h_ _s_ iva\n_h_ _s_ anto 'tihity evaitad aha,' which has likewise found its way into the\nSa _m_ hita of that school. On the Mu _g_ avats, see Muir, Orig. Sanskrit\nTexts, vol. ii. p. 352.\n\n[443:2](sbe1261.htm#fr_996) According to Katy. V, 10, 22, he mutters the word\n'skin-clad' while steadying the two baskets.\n\n[443:3](sbe1261.htm#fr_997) See [p. 2](sbe1203.htm#page_2), note\n[2](sbe1203.htm#fn_84).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 6, 3.
