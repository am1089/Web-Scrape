Sitting (a man is to meditate), on account of the possibility.\n\nAs meditations connected with members of sacrificial action depend on action,\nwe need not raise the question whether they are to be carried on in a sitting,\nor any other posture. The same holds good in the case of perfect intuition,\nsince knowledge depends on its object only. With regard to all other\nmeditations, on the other hand, the author of the Sutras raises the question\nwhether they may be undertaken indifferently by a person standing, sitting, or\nlying down, or only by a person sitting.\n\nThe purvapakshin here maintains that as meditation is something mental there\ncan be no restriction as to the attitude of the body.--No, the author of the\nSutras rejoins; 'Sitting' only a man is to meditate.--Why?--'On account of the\npossibility.' By meditation we understand the lengthened carrying on of an\nidentical train of thought; and of this a man is capable neither when going\nnor when running, since the act of going and so on tends to distract the mind.\n\np. 350\n\n[paragraph continues] The mind of a standing man, again, is directed on\nmaintaining the body in an erect position, and therefore incapable of\nreflection on any subtle matter. A man lying down, finally, is unawares\novercome by slumber. A sitting person, on the other hand, may easily avoid\nthese several untoward occurrences, and is therefore in a position to carry on\nmeditations.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 1, 8](sbe38269.htm)\n\n"
