Accept, O Agni, this my piece of wood and this my sitting down\n(reverentially) [1](sbe46056.htm#an_2:6:1:1), and hear these words of mine.\n\n2\\. Let us worship thee, Agni, child of vigour, with this (piece of wood?)\n[1](sbe46056.htm#an_2:6:2:1), O winner of horses [2](sbe46056.htm#an_2:6:2:2),\nwith this well-spoken (hymn), O well-born one.\n\n3\\. May we thus as thy devoted servants pay devotion by our words to thee who\nacceptest words (of prayer), to thee who aspirest after wealth, O giver of\nwealth.\n\n4\\. Thus be thou a liberal, bountiful lord, O lord of goods, O giver of goods.\nDrive hatred away from us.\n\n5\\. Thus (give) us [1](sbe46056.htm#an_2:6:5:1) rain from the sky; thus (give)\nus unattainable strength; thus (give) us thousandfold food.\n\n6\\. To him who magnifies thee, who desires thy help, O youngest messenger,\n(invoked) by our word, best sacrificing Hot _ri_ , come near.\n\n7\\. For thou, Agni, O sage, who knowest both races (of gods and of men),\npassest (to and fro) between them, like a messenger belonging to thy own\npeople [1](sbe46056.htm#an_2:6:7:1), belonging to thy allies.\n\n8\\. Thus gladden (the gods) [1](sbe46056.htm#an_2:6:8:1) as the knowing one;\nsacrifice, O intelligent one, in due order, and sit down on this Barhis.\n\np. 210\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi. Metre, Gayatri.--Verse 4 = VS. XII, 43; TS. IV, 2, 3, 4;\nMS. II, 7, 10.--The hymn has been translated by M. M., Selected Essays, II, p.\n143.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. It does not seem probable that upasad is to be translated here\naccording to its meaning in the later ritual, as one of the preparatory\nceremonies of the Soma sacrifice. See Weber, Indische Studien, X, 363;\nHillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, I, 300.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Aya\xc2\xb4 may be used adverbially: comp. III, 12, 2; VI, 17, 15; IX, 53, 2;\n106, 14. But it is more probable that samidha or gira\xc2\xb4 should be supplied from\nverse 1. Comp. II, 24, 1. aya\xc2\xb4 vidhema gira\xc2\xb4; IV, 4, 15. aya\xc2\xb4 samidha vidhema.\n\nNote 2. Comp. VIII, 61, 7. a _s_ vam-ish _t_ aye.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. The conjecture sana _h_ , proposed by Bohtlingk-Roth and Grassmann, is\nnot necessary. The verb is to be supplied; comp. the passages collected by\nPischel, Vedische Studien, I, 19.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. _G_ anyeva seems to be _g_ anya _h_ iva, comp. 11, 39, 1. duta\xc2\xb4-iva\nhavya _g_ anya purutra\xc2\xb4; IV, 55, 5. pa\xc2\xb4t pati _h_ _g_ anyat a _m_ hasa _h_ na\n_h_.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. Comp. VII, 17, 4. yakshat deva\xc2\xb4n am _r i_tan piprayat _k_ a; VIII, 39,\n9. yakshat _k_ a piprayat _k_ a na _h_.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 7](sbe46057.htm)\n\n'
