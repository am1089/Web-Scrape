Man is sacrifice. His (first) twenty-four years are the morning-libation.\nThe Gayatri has twenty-four syllables, the morning-libation is offered with\nGayatri hymns. The Vasus are connected with that part of the sacrifice. The\nPra _n_ as (the five senses) are the Vasus, for they make all this to abide\n(vasayanti).\n\n2\\. If anything ails him in that (early) age, let him say: 'Ye Pra _n_ as, ye\nVasus, extend this my morning-libation unto the midday-libation, that I, the\nsacrificer, may not perish in the midst of the Pra _n_ as or Vasus.' Thus he\nrecovers from his illness, and becomes whole.\n\n3\\. The next forty-four years are the midday-libation. The Trish _t_ ubh has\nforty-four syllables, the midday-libation is offered with Trish _t_ ubh hymns.\nThe Rudras are connected with that part of it. The Pra _n_ as are the Rudras,\nfor they make all this to cry (rodayanti).\n\n4\\. If anything ails him in that (second) age, let him say: 'Ye Pra _n_ as, ye\nRudras, extend this my midday-libation unto the third libation, that I, the\nsacrificer, may not perish in the midst of the Pra _n_ as or Rudras.' Thus he\nrecovers from his illness, and becomes whole.\n\n5\\. The next forty-eight years are the third\n\np. 51\n\nlibation. The _G_ agati has forty-eight syllables, the third libation is\noffered with _G_ agati hymns. The \xc3\x82dityas are connected with that part of it.\nThe Pra _n_ as are the \xc3\x82dityas, for they take up all this (adadate).\n\n6\\. If anything ails him in that (third) age, let him say: 'Ye Pra _n_ as, ye\n\xc3\x82dityas, extend this my third libation unto the full age, that I, the\nsacrificer, may not perish in the midst of the Pra _n_ as or \xc3\x82dityas.' Thus he\nrecovers from his illness, and becomes whole.\n\n7\\. Mahidasa Aitareya (the son of Itara), who knew this, said (addressing a\ndisease): 'Why dost thou afflict me, as I shall not die by it?' He lived a\nhundred and sixteen years (i.e. 24+44+48). He, too, who knows this lives on to\na hundred and sixteen years.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[50:1](sbe01074.htm#fr_186) The object of this Kha _n_ _d_ a is to show how to\nobtain long life, as promised before.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 17](sbe01075.htm)\n\n"
