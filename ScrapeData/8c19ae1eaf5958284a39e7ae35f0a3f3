A secret penance (must be performed) by him whose sin is not publicly\nknown. 1\n\np. 292\n\n2\\. He who desires to accept or has accepted (a gift) which ought not to be\naccepted, shall recite the four _Ri_ k-verses (IX, 58, 1-4), (beginning) Tarat\nsa mandi, (standing) in water. 2\n\n3\\. He who desires to eat forbidden food, shall scatter earth (on it). 3\n\n4\\. Some (declare, that) he who has connection with a woman during her courses\nbecomes pure by bathing. 4\n\n5\\. Some (declare, that this rule holds good) in the case of (one's own) wives\n(only). 5\n\n6\\. The (secret) penance for killing a learned Brahma _n_ a (is as follows):,\nLiving during ten days on milk (alone) or (on food fit for offerings), during\na second (period of ten days) on clarified butter, and during a third (period\nof ten days) on water, partaking 6\n\np. 293\n\nof (such food) once only each day, in the morning, and keeping his garments\nconstantly wet, he shall (daily) offer (eight) oblations, (representing) the\nhair, the nails, the skin, the flesh, the blood, the sinews, the bones, (and)\nthe marrow. The end of each (Mantra) shall be, 'I offer in the mouth of the\nAtman (the Self), in the jaws of Death.'\n\n7\\. Now another (penance for the murder of a Brahma _n_ a will be described):\n\n8\\. The rule (as to eating and so forth), which has been declared (above,\nSutra 6, must be observed),\n\n9\\. (And) he shall offer clarified butter, reciting (the sacred text Rig-veda\nI, 189, 2), 'O fire, do thou ferry over,' the Mahavyah _ri_ tis, and the\nKushma _n_ _d_ as; 9\n\n10\\. Or, for the murder of a Brahma _n_ a, for drinking spirituous liquor, for\nstealing (gold), and for the violation of a Guru's bed, he may perform that\n(same vow), tire himself by repeatedly stopping his breath, and recite (the\nhymn seen by) Aghamarsha _n_ a. That is equal (in efficacy) to the final bath\nat a horse-sacrifice; 10\n\n11\\. Or, repeating the Gayatri a thousand times, he, forsooth, purifies\nhimself; 11\n\n12\\. Or, thrice repeating (the hymn of) Aghamarsha _n_ a while immersed in\nwater, he is freed from all sins.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[291:1](sbe0288.htm#fr_1443) **XXIV**. Manu XI, 248; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III,\n301.\n\n[292:2](sbe0288.htm#fr_1444) Manu XI, 254. 'He who has accepted or desires to\naccept, i.e. because no other course is possible, (a present) offered by a man\nthat is blamable on account of the caste of the giver or on account of his\ndeeds, or (a present) that in itself is blamable, e.g. the skin of a black-\nbuck and the like . . . in water, i.e. according to some, standing in water\nthat reaches to his navel according to others, entirely immersed in water.'--\nHaradatta.\n\n[292:3](sbe0288.htm#fr_1445) Manu loc. cit. 'Forbidden food has been described\nabove, XVII, 8, 9. If, being unable to act otherwise, he desires to eat that,\nhe shall throw earth, i.e. a piece of earth, (into it) and then eat it.'--\nHaradatta.\n\n[292:4](sbe0288.htm#fr_1446) Haradatta adds that he shall bathe, dressed in\nhis garments.\n\n[292:5](sbe0288.htm#fr_1447) Haradatta adds that another commentator reads\nekestrishu, i.e. eke astrishu, and explains the Sutra to mean, 'Some (declare\nthe above rule to refer also) to a bestial crime.'\n\n[292:6](sbe0288.htm#fr_1448) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 303. According to\nHaradatta the complete Mantras are as follows: Lomanyatmano mukhe m _ri_\ntyorasye _g_ uhomi svaha, nakhanya. m. m. a. _g_ uhomi svaha, &c. This secret\npenance is apparently a milder form of that prescribed \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 25, 12.\n\n[293:9](sbe0288.htm#fr_1449) The Mahavyah _ri_ tis are, bhu _h_ , bhuva _h_ ,\nsva _h_. Regarding the Kushma _n_ _d_ as, see above, XIX, 12.\n\n[293:10](sbe0288.htm#fr_1450) Manu XI, 260-261; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 302.\nThe vow intended is that prescribed above, Sutras 6, 8.\n\n[293:11](sbe0288.htm#fr_1451) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 26, 14-I, 9, 27, 1. Haradatta\nremarks that the performer of the penance shall live on milk and stop his\nbreath, repeatedly stopping his breath.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXV](sbe0289.htm)\n\n"
