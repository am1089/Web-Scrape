Now the spit-ox (sacrificed to Rudra).\n\n2\\. In autumn or in spring, under the (Nakshatra) \xc3\x82rdra.\n\n3\\. The best of his herd,\n\n4\\. (An ox) which is neither leprous nor speckled;\n\n5 5. One with black spots, according to some;\n\n6\\. If he likes, a black one, if its colour inclines to copper-colour.\n\n7\\. He sprinkles it with water, into which he has thrown rice and barley,\n\n8\\. From head to tail,\n\n9\\. With (the formula), 'Grow up, agreeable to Rudra the great god.'\n\n10 10. He should let it grow up. When it has cut its teeth, or when it has\nbecome a bull\xc2\x97\n\n11 11. To a quarter (of the horizon) which is sacrificially pure,\n\n12\\. At a place which cannot be seen from the village,\n\np. 256\n\n13\\. After midnight,\n\n14\\. According to some, after sunrise.\n\n15 15. Having caused a Brahman who is versed in learning and knows the\npractice (of this sacrifice), to sit down, having driven a fresh branch with\nleaves into the ground as a sacrificial post, (having taken) two creeping\nplants or two Ku _s_ a ropes as two girdles, and having wound the one round\nthe sacrificial post, and tied the other round the middle of the animal's\nhead, he binds it to the sacrificial post or to the girdle (which he had tied\nto that post) with (the formula), 'Agreeable to him to whom adoration (is\nbrought), I bind thee.'\n\n16 16. The sprinkling with water and what follows is the same as at the animal\nsacrifice.\n\n17\\. We shall state what is different.\n\n18\\. Let him sacrifice the omentum with the Patri or with a leaf\xc2\x97thus it is\nunderstood (in the _S_ ruti)\xc2\x97\n\n19\\. With (the formulas), 'To Hara, M _ri_ _d_ a, _S_ arva, _S_ iva, Bhava,\nMahadeva, Ugra, Bhima, Pa _s_ upati, Rudra, _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, \xc3\x8e _s_ ana svaha!'\n\n20\\. Or with the last six (parts of that formula),\n\n21\\. Or with (the formula), 'To Rudra svaha!'\n\n22 22. Let him make Bali offerings towards the four quarters (of the horizon),\nto each on four rings of Ku _s_ a net-work, with (the formulas), 'The hosts,\nRudra, which thou hast towards the eastern direction,\n\np. 257\n\nto them this (offering is brought). Adoration to thee! Do no harm to me!' In\nthis way the assigning (of the offerings is performed) according to the\ndifferent quarters (of the horizon).\n\n23\\. With the following four hymns he should worship the four quarters, viz.\n'What shall we to Rudra,' 'These prayers to Rudra,' 'To thee, O father,'\n'These songs to Rudra with the strong bow' (Rig-veda I, 43, 114; II, 33; VII,\n46).\n\n24\\. (This) worship to the quarters (of the horizon) (is performed) at all\nsacrifices to Rudra.\n\n25\\. The husks and chaff (of the rice), the tail, the skin, the head, the feet\n(of the sacrificial animal) he should throw into the fire.\n\n26 26. He should turn the skin to some use, according to _S_ a _m_ vatya.\n\n27 27. To the north of the fire, on rows of Darbha grass, or on rings of Ku\n_s_ a net-work, he should pour out the blood (of the sacrificial animal) with\n(the formula), 'Hissing ones! Noisy ones! Searching ones! Seizing ones!\nSerpents! What here belongs to you, take that.'\n\n28\\. Then, turning to the north, (he assigns it) to the serpents (in the\nwords), 'Hissing ones! Noisy ones! Searching ones! Seizing ones! Serpents!\nWhat here belongs to you, take that.'\n\nThen the serpents take whatever has flowed down there of blood or of the\ncontents of stomach and entrails.\n\n29\\. All names, all hosts, all exaltations belong\n\np. 258\n\nto him;\xc2\x97to a sacrificer who knows that, he gives joy.\n\n30\\. Even to a man who only with words sets forth (some part) of that\n(ceremony), he will do no harm; thus it is understood (in the _S_ ruti).\n\n31\\. He should not partake of that (sacrifice).\n\n32 32. They should not take anything belonging to it into the village. For\nthis god will do harm to (human) creatures.\n\n33\\. He should keep away his people from the vicinity (of the place where he\nhas sacrificed).\n\n34\\. On an express injunction, however, he should partake (of that sacrificial\nfood), for it will bring luck.\n\n35\\. This spit-ox sacrifice procures wealth, (open) space, purity, sons,\ncattle, long life, splendour.\n\n36 36. After he has sacrificed, he should let loose another (animal).\n\n37\\. He should not be without such an animal.\n\n38\\. Then he will not be without cattle\xc2\x97thus it is understood (in the _S_\nruti).\n\n39 39. Muttering the _S_ antatiya hymn, he should go to his house.\n\n40\\. If disease befalls his cattle, he should sacrifice to that same god in\nthe midst of his cow-stable\xc2\x97\n\n41\\. A mess of cooked food, which he sacrifices in its entirety.\n\np. 259\n\n42\\. Having thrown the sacrificial grass and the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya into the fire, he\nshould lead his cows through the smoke.\n\n43\\. Murmuring the _S_ antatiya hymn, he should go in the midst of his cattle.\n\n44\\. Adoration to _S_ aunaka! Adoration to _S_ aunaka!\n\nEnd of the Fourth Adhyaya.\n\nEnd of the \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana-G _ri_ hya-sutra.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[255:1](sbe29153.htm#fr_640) 8, 1.
