At last the\ntwain unexpectedly came upon a beautiful "tank [47]" of a prodigious size. It\nwas surrounded by short thick walls of fine baked brick; and flights and ramps\nof cut-stone steps, half the length of each face, and adorned with turrets,\npendants, and finials, led down to the water. The substantial plaster work and\nthe masonry had fallen into disrepair, and from the crevices sprang huge\ntrees, under whose thick shade the breeze blew freshly, and on whose balmy\nbranches the birds sang sweetly; the grey squirrels [48] chirruped joyously as\nthey coursed one another up the gnarled trunks, and from the pendent llianas\nthe longtailed monkeys were swinging sportively. The bountiful hand of Sravana\n[49] had spread the earthen rampart with a carpet of the softest grass and\nmany-hued wild flowers, in which were buzzing swarms of bees and myriads of\nbright winged insects; and flocks of water fowl, wild geese Brahmini ducks,\nbitterns, herons, and cranes, male and female, were feeding on the narrow\nstrip of brilliant green that belted the long deep pool, amongst the broad-\nleaved lotuses with the lovely blossoms, splashing through the pellucid waves,\nand basking happily in the genial sun.\n\nThe prince and his friend wondered when they saw the beautiful tank in the\nmidst of a wild forest, and made many vain conjectures about it. They\ndismounted, tethered their horses, and threw their weapons upon the ground;\nthen, having washed their hands and faces, they entered a shrine dedicated to\nMahadeva, and there began to worship the presiding deity.\n\nWhilst they were making their offerings, a bevy of maidens, accompanied by a\ncrowd of female slaves, descended the opposite flight of steps. They stood\nthere for a time, talking and laughing and looking about them to see if any\nalligators infested the waters. When convinced that the tank was safe, they\ndisrobed themselves in order to bathe. It was truly a splendid spectacle\n\n"Concerning which the less said the better," interrupted RajaVikram in an\noffended tone.[50]\n\n\\--but did not last long. The Raja\'s daughter--for the principal maiden was a\nprincess--soon left her companions, who were scooping up water with their\npalms and dashing it over one another\'s heads, and proceeded to perform the\nrites of purification, meditation, and worship. Then she began strolling with\na friend under the shade of a small mango grove.\n\nThe prince also left his companion sitting in prayer, and walked forth into\nthe forest. Suddenly the eyes of the Raja\'s son and the Raja\'s daughter met.\nShe started back with a little scream. He was fascinated by her beauty, and\nbegan to say to himself, " O thou vile Karma,[51] why worriest thou me?"\n\nHearing this, the maiden smiled encouragement, but the poor youth, between\npalpitation of the heart and hesitation about what to say, was so confused\nthat his tongue crave to his teeth. She raised her eyebrows a little. There is\nnothing which women despise in a man more than modesty, [52] for mo-des-ty--\n\nA violent shaking of the bag which hung behind Vikram\'s royal back broke off\nthe end of this offensive sentence. And the warrior king did not cease that\ndiscipline till the Baital promised him to preserve more decorum in his\nobservations.\n\nStill the prince stood before her with downcast eyes and suffused cheeks: even\nthe spur of contempt failed to arouse his energies. Then the maiden called to\nher friend, who was picking jasmine flowers so as not to witness the scene,\nand angrily asked why that strange man was allowed to stand and stare at her?\nThe friend, in hot wrath, threatened to call the slave, and throw Vajramukut\ninto the pond unless he instantly went away with his impudence. But as the\nprince was rooted to the spot, and really had not heard a word of what had\nbeen said to him, the two women were obliged to make the first move.\n\nAs they almost reached the tank, the beautiful maiden turned her head to see\nwhat the poor modest youth was doing.\n\nVajramukut was formed in every way to catch a woman\'s eye. The Raja\'s daughter\ntherefore half forgave him his offence of mod----. Again she sweetly smiled,\ndisclosing two rows of little opals. Then descending to the water\'s edge, she\nstooped down and plucked a lotus This she worshipped; next she placed it in\nher hair, then she put it in her ear, then she bit it with her teeth, then she\ntrod upon it with her foot, then she raised it up again, and lastly she stuck\nit in her bosom. After which she mounted her conveyance and went home to her\nfriends; whilst the prince, having become thoroughly desponding and drowned in\ngrief at separation from her, returned to the minister\'s son.\n\n"Females!" ejaculated the minister\'s son, speaking to himself in a careless\ntone, when, his prayer finished, he left the temple, and sat down upon the\ntank steps to enjoy the breeze. He presently drew a roll of paper from under\nhis waist-belt, and in a short time was engrossed with his study. The women\nseeing this conduct, exerted themselves in every possible way of wile to\nattract his attention and to distract his soul. They succeeded only so far as\nto make him roll his head with a smile, and to remember that such is always\nthe custom of man\'s bane; after which he turned over a fresh page of\nmanuscript. And although he presently began to wonder what had become of the\nprince his master, he did not look up even once from his study.\n\nHe was a philosopher, that young man. But after all, Raja Vikram, what is\nmortal philosophy? Nothing but another name for indifference! Who was ever\nphilosophical about a thing truly loved or really hated?--no one! Philosophy,\nsays Shankharacharya, is either a gift of nature or the reward of study. But\nI, the Baital, the devil, ask you, what is a born philosopher, save a man of\ncold desires? And what is a bred philosopher but a man who has survived his\ndesires? A young philosopher?--a cold-blooded youth! An elderly philosopher?--\na leuco-phlegmatic old man! Much nonsense, of a verity, ye hear in praise of\nnothing from your Rajaship\'s Nine Gems of Science, and from sundry other such\nwise fools.\n\nThen the prince began to relate the state of his case, saying, " O friend, I\nhave seen a damsel, but whether she be a musician from Indra\'s heaven, a\nmaiden of the sea, a daughter of the serpent kings, or the child of an earthly\nRaja, I cannot say."\n\n"Describe her," said the statesman in embryo.\n\n"Her face," quoth the prince, "was that of the full moon, her hair like a\nswarm of bees hanging from the blossoms of the acacia, the corners of her eyes\ntouched her ears, her lips were sweet with lunar ambrosia, her waist was that\nof a lion, and her walk the walk of a king goose. [53] As a garment, she was\nwhite; as a season, the spring; as a flower, the jasmine; as a speaker, the\nkokila bird; as a perfume, musk; as a beauty, Kamadeva; and as a being, Love.\nAnd if she does not come into my possession I will not live; this I have\ncertainly determined upon."\n\nThe young minister, who had heard his prince say the same thing more than once\nbefore, did not attach great importance to these awful words. He merely\nremarked that, unless they mounted at once, night would surprise them in the\nforest. Then the two young men returned to their horses, untethered them, drew\non their bridles, saddled them, and catching up their weapons, rode slowly\ntowards the Raja\'s palace. During the three hours of return hardly a word\npassed between the pair. Vajramukut not only avoided speaking; he never once\nreplied till addressed thrice in the loudest voice.\n\nThe young minister put no more questions, "for," quoth he to himself, "when\nthe prince wants my counsel, he will apply for it." In this point he had\nborrowed wisdom from his father, who held in peculiar horror the giving of\nunasked- for advice. So, when he saw that conversation was irksome to his\nmaster, he held his peace and meditated upon what he called his "day-thought."\nIt was his practice to choose every morning some tough food for reflection,\nand to chew the cud of it in his mind at times when, without such employment,\nhis wits would have gone wool-gathering. You may imagine, Raja Vikram, that\nwith a few years of this head work, the minister\'s son became a very crafty\nyoung person.\n\nAfter the second day the Prince Vajramukut, being restless from grief at\nseparation, fretted himself into a fever. Having given up writing, reading,\ndrinking, sleeping, the affairs entrusted to him by his father, and everything\nelse, he sat down, as he said, to die. He used constantly to paint the\nportrait of the beautiful lotus gatherer, and to lie gazing upon it with\ntearful eyes; then he would start up and tear it to pieces and beat his\nforehead, and begin another picture of a yet more beautiful face.\n\nAt last, as the pradhan\'s son had foreseen, he was summoned by the young Raja,\nwhom he found upon his bed, looking yellow and complaining bitterly of\nheadache. Frequent discussions upon the subject of the tender passion had\npassed between the two youths, and one of them had ever spoken of it so very\ndisrespectfully that the other felt ashamed to introduce it. But when his\nfriend, with a view to provoke communicativeness, advised a course of boiled\nand bitter herbs and great attention to diet, quoting the hemistich attributed\nto the learned physician Charndatta\n\nA fever starve, but feed a cold,\n\nthe unhappy Vajramukut\'s fortitude abandoned him; he burst into tears, and\nexclaimed," Whosoever enters upon the path of love cannot survive it; and if\n(by chance) he should live, what is life to him but a prolongation of his\nmisery?"\n\n"Yea," replied the minister\'s son, "the sage hath said--\n\nThe road of love is that which hath no beginning nor end; Take thou heed of\nthyself, man I ere thou place foot upon it.\n\nAnd the wise, knowing that there are three things whose effect upon himself no\nman can foretell--namely, desire of woman, the dice-box, and the drinking of\nardent spirits--find total abstinence from them the best of rules. Yet, after\nall, if there is no cow, we must milk the bull."\n\nThe advice was, of course, excellent, but the hapless lover could not help\nthinking that on this occasion it came a little too late. However, after a\npause he returned to the subject and said, "I have ventured to tread that\ndangerous way, be its end pain or pleasure, happiness or destruction." He then\nhung down his head and sighed from the bottom of his heart.\n\n"She is the person who appeared to us at the tank?" asked the pradhan\'s son,\nmoved to compassion by the state of his master.\n\nThe prince assented.\n\n"O great king," resumed the minister\'s son, "at the time of going away had she\nsaid anything to you? or had you said anything to her?"\n\n"Nothing!" replied the other laconically, when he found his friend beginning\nto take an interest in the affair.\n\n"Then," said the minister\'s son, "it will be exceedingly difficult to get\npossession of her."\n\n"Then," repeated the Raja\'s son, "I am doomed to death; to an early and\nmelancholy death!"\n\n"Humph!" ejaculated the young statesman rather impatiently, "did she make any\nsign, or give any hint? Let me know all that happened: half confidences are\nworse than none."\n\nUpon which the prince related everything that took place by the side of the\ntank, bewailing the false shame which had made him dumb, and concluding with\nher pantomime.\n\nThe pradhan\'s son took thought for a while. He thereupon seized the\nopportunity of representing to his master all the evil effects of bashfulness\nwhen women are concerned, and advised him, as he would be a happy lover, to\nbrazen his countenance for the next interview.\n\nWhich the young Raja faithfully promised to do.\n\n"And, now," said the other, "be comforted, O my master! I know her name and\nher dwelling-place. When she suddenly plucked the lotus flower and worshipped\nit, she thanked the gods for having blessed her with a sight of your beauty."\n\nVajramukut smiled, the first time for the last month.\n\n"When she applied it to her ear, it was as if she would have explained to\nthee, \'I am a daughter of the Carnatic: [54] and when she bit it with her\nteeth, she meant to say that \'My father is Raja Dantawat, [55]\' who, by-the-\nbye, has been, is, and ever will be, a mortal foe to thy father."\n\nVajramukut shuddered.\n\n"When she put it under her foot it meant, \'My name is Padmavati. [56]\'"\n\nVajramukut uttered a cry of joy.\n\n"And when she placed it in her bosom, \'You are truly dwelling in my heart\' was\nmeant to be understood."\n\nAt these words the young Raja started up full of new life, and after praising\nwith enthusiasm the wondrous sagacity of his dear friend, begged him by some\ncontrivance to obtain the permission of his parents, and to conduct him to her\ncity. The minister\'s son easily got leave for Vajramukut to travel, under\npretext that his body required change of water, and his mind change of scene.\nThey both dressed and armed themselves for the journey, and having taken some\njewels, mounted their horses and followed the road in that direction in which\nthe princess had gone.\n\nArrived after some days at the capital of the Carnatic, the minister\'s son\nhaving disguised his master and himself in the garb of travelling traders,\nalighted and pitched his little tent upon a clear bit of ground in one of the\nsuburbs. He then proceeded to inquire for a wise woman, wanting, he said, to\nhave his fortune told. When the prince asked him what this meant, he replied\nthat elderly dames who professionally predict the future are never above\n[ministering to the present, and therefore that, in such circumstances, they\nare the properest persons to be consulted.\n\n"Is this a treatise upon the subject of immorality, devil?" demanded the King\nVikram ferociously. The Baital declared that it was not, but that he must tell\nhis story.\n\nThe person addressed pointed to an old woman who, seated before the door of\nher hut, was spinning at her wheel. Then the young men went up to her with\npolite salutations and said, "Mother, we are travelling traders, and our stock\nis coming after us; we have come on in advance for the purpose of finding a\nplace to live in. If you will give us a house, we will remain there and pay\nyou highly."\n\nThe old woman, who was a physiognomist as well as a fortune-teller, looked at\nthe faces of the young men and liked them, because their brows were wide, and\ntheir mouths denoted generosity. Having listened to their words, she took pity\nupon them and said kindly, "This hovel is yours, my masters, remain here as\nlong as you please." Then she led them into an inner room, again welcomed\nthem, lamented the poorness of her abode, and begged them to lie down and rest\nthemselves.\n\nAfter some interval of time the old woman came to them once more, and sitting\ndown began to gossip. The minister\'s son upon this asked her, "How is it with\nthy family, thy relatives, and connections; and what are thy means of\nsubsistence?" She replied, ``My son is a favourite servant in the household of\nour great king Dantawat, and your slave is the wet-nurse of the Princess\nPadmavati, his eldest child. From the coming on of old age," she added, "I\ndwell in this house, but the king provides for my eating and drinking. I go\nonce a day to see the girl, who is a miracle of beauty and goodness, wit and\naccomplishments, and returning thence, I bear my own griefs at home. [57]\'\'\n\nIn a few days the young Vajramukut had, by his liberality, soft speech, and\ngood looks, made such progress in nurse Lakshmi\'s affections that, by the\nadvice of his companion, he ventured to broach the subject ever nearest his\nheart. He begged his hostess, when she went on the morrow to visit the\ncharming Padmavati, that she would be kind enough to slip a bit of paper into\nthe princess\'s hand.\n\n"Son," she replied, delighted with the proposal--and what old woman would not\nbe?--"there is no need for putting off so urgent an affair till the morrow.\nGet your paper ready, and I will immediately give it."\n\nTrembling with pleasure, the prince ran to find his friend, who was seated in\nthe garden reading, as usual, and told him what the old nurse had engaged to\ndo. He then began to debate about how he should write his letter, to cull\nsentences and to weigh phrases; whether "light of my eyes" was not too trite,\nand "blood of my liver" rather too forcible. At this the minister\'s son\nsmiled, and bade the prince not trouble his head with composition. He then\ndrew his inkstand from his waist shawl, nibbed a reed pen, and choosing a\npiece of pink and flowered paper, he wrote upon it a few lines. He then folded\nit, gummed it, sketched a lotus flower upon the outside, and handing it to the\nyoung prince, told him to give it to their hostess, and that all would be\nwell.\n\nThe old woman took her staff in her hand and hobbled straight to the palace.\nArrived there, she found the Raja\'s daughter sitting alone in her apartment.\nThe maiden, seeing her nurse, immediately arose, and making a respectful bow,\nled her to a seat and began the most affectionate inquiries. After giving her\nblessing and sitting for some time and chatting about indifferent matters, the\nnurse said, "O daughter! in infancy I reared and nourished thee, now the\nBhagwan (Deity) has rewarded me by giving thee stature, beauty, health, and\ngoodness. My heart only longs to see the happiness of thy womanhood, [58]\nafter which I shall depart in peace. I implore thee read this paper, given to\nme by the handsomest and the properest young man that my eyes have ever seen."\n\nThe princess, glancing at the lotus on the outside of the note, slowly\nunfolded it and perused its contents, which were as follows:\n\n1.\n\nShe was to me the pearl that clings To sands all hid from mortal sight, Yet\nfit for diadems of kings, The pure and lovely light.\n\n2.\n\nShe was to me the gleam of sun That breaks the gloom of wintry day; One moment\nshone my soul upon, Then passed--how soon!--away.\n\n3.\n\nShe was to me the dreams of bliss That float the dying eyes before, For one\nshort hour shed happiness, And fly to bless no more.\n\n4.\n\nO light, again upon me shine; O pearl, again delight my eyes; O dreams of\nbliss, again be mine!--No! earth may not be Paradise.\n\nI must not forget to remark, parenthetically, that the minister\'s son, in\norder to make these lines generally useful, had provided them with a last\nstanza in triplicate. "For lovers," he said sagely," are either in the\noptative mood, the desperative, or the exultative." This time he had used the\noptative. For the desperative he would substitute:\n\n4.\n\nThe joys of life lie dead, lie dead, The light of day is quenched in gloom The\nspark of hope my heart hath fled--What now witholds me from the tomb?\n\nAnd this was the termination exultative, as he called it:\n\n4.\n\nO joy I the pearl is mine again, Once more the day is bright and clear, And\nnow \'tis real, then \'twas vain, My dream of bliss--O heaven is here!\n\nThe Princess Padmavati having perused this doggrel with a contemptuous look,\ntore off the first word of the last line, and said to the nurse, angrily, "Get\nthee gone, O mother of Yama, [59] O unfortunate creature, and take back this\nanswer"--giving her the scrap of paper--"to the fool who writes such bad\nverses. I wonder where he studied the humanities. Begone, and never do such an\naction again!"\n\nThe old nurse, distressed at being so treated, rose up and returned home.\nVajramukut was too agitated to await her arrival, so he went to meet her on\nthe way. Imagine his disappointment when she gave him the fatal word and\nrepeated to him exactly what happened, not forgetting to describe a single\nlook! He felt tempted to plunge his sword into his bosom; but Fortune\ninterfered, and sent him to consult his confidant.\n\n"Be not so hasty and desperate, my prince," said the pradhan\'s son, seeing his\nwild grief; "you have not understood her meaning. Later in life you will be\naware of the fact that, in nine cases out of ten, a woman\'s \'no\' is a distinct\n\'yes.\' This morning\'s work has been good; the maiden asked where you learnt\nthe humanities, which being interpreted signifies \'Who are you?"\'\n\nOn the next day the prince disclosed his rank to old Lakshmi, who naturally\ndeclared that she had always known it. The trust they reposed in her made her\nready to address Padmavati once more on the forbidden subject. So she again\nwent to the palace, and having lovingly greeted her nursling, said to her,\n"The Raja\'s son, whose heart thou didst fascinate on the brim of the tank, on\nthe fifth day of the moon, in the light half of the month Yeth, has come to my\nhouse, and sends this message to thee: "Perform what you promised; we have now\ncome"; and I also tell thee that this prince is worthy of thee: just as thou\nart beautiful, so is he endowed with all good qualities of mind and body."\n\nWhen Padmavati heard this speech she showed great anger, and, rubbing sandal\non her beautiful hands, she slapped the old woman\'s cheeks, and cried,\n"Wretch, Daina (witch)! get out of my house; did I not forbid thee to talk\nsuch folly in my presence?"\n\nThe lover and the nurse were equally distressed at having taken the advice of\nthe young minister, till he explained what the crafty damsel meant. "When she\nsmeared the sandal on her ten fingers," he explained, "and struck the old\nwoman on the face, she signified that when the remaining ten moonlight nights\nshall have passed away she will meet you in the dark." At the same time he\nwarned his master that to all appearances the lady Padmavati was far too\nclever to make a comfortable wife. The minister\'s son especially hated\ntalented intellectual, and strong-minded women; he had been heard to describe\nthe torments of Naglok [60] as the compulsory companionship of a polemical\ndivine and a learned authoress, well stricken in years and of forbidding\naspect, as such persons mostly are. Amongst womankind he admired--\ntheoretically, as became a philosopher--the small, plump, laughing,\nchattering, unintellectual, and material-minded. And therefore--excuse the\ndigression, Raja Vikram--he married an old maid, tall, thin, yellow, strictly\nproper, cold-mannered, a conversationist, and who prided herself upon\nspirituality. But more wonderful still, after he did marry her, he actually\nloved her--what an incomprehensible being is man in these matters!\n\nTo return, however. The pradhan\'s son, who detected certain symptoms of\nstrong-mindedness in the Princess Padmavati, advised his lord to be wise\nwhilst wisdom availed him. This sage counsel was, as might be guessed, most\nungraciously rejected by him for whose benefit it was intended. Then the\nsensible young statesman rated himself soundly for having broken his father\'s\nrule touching advice, and atoned for it by blindly forwarding the views of his\nmaster.\n\nAfter the ten nights of moonlight had passed, the old nurse was again sent to\nthe palace with the usual message. This time Padmavati put saffron on three of\nher fingers, and again left their marks on the nurse\'s cheek. The minister\'s\nson explained that this was to crave delay for three days, and that on the\nfourth the lover would have access to her.\n\nWhen the time had passed the old woman again went and inquired after her\nhealth and well-being. The princess was as usual very wroth, and having\npersonally taken her nurse to the western gate, she called her "Mother of the\nelephant\'s trunk, [61]\'\' and drove her out with threats of the bastinado if\nshe ever came back. This was reported to the young statesman, who, after a few\nminutes\' consideration, said, "The explanation of this matter is, that she has\ninvited you to-morrow, at nighttime, to meet her at this very gate.\n\n"When brown shadows fell upon the face of earth, and here and there a star\nspangled the pale heavens, the minister\'s son called Vajramukut, who had been\nengaged in adorning himself at least half that day. He had carefully shaved\nhis cheeks and chin; his mustachio was trimmed and curled; he had arched his\neyebrows by plucking out with tweezers the fine hairs around them; he had\ntrained his curly musk-coloured love-locks to hang gracefully down his face;\nhe had drawn broad lines of antimony along his eyelids, a most brilliant\nsectarian mark was affixed to his forehead, the colour of his lips had been\nheightened by chewing betel-nut--\n\n"One would imagine that you are talking of a silly girl, not of a prince,\nfiend!" interrupted Vikram, who did not wish his son to hear what he called\nthese fopperies and frivolities.\n\n\\--and whitened his neck by having it shaved (continued the Baital, speaking\nquickly, as if determined not to be interrupted), and reddened the tips of his\nears by squeezing them, and made his teeth shine by rubbing copper powder into\nthe roots, and set off the delicacy of his fingers by staining the tips with\nhenna. He had not been less careful with his dress: he wore a well-arranged\nturband, which had taken him at least two hours to bind, and a rich suit of\nbrown stuff chosen for the adventure he was about to attempt, and he hung\nabout his person a number of various weapons, so as to appear a hero--which\nyoung damsels admire.\n\nVajramukut asked his friend how he looked, and smiled happily when the other\nreplied "Admirable!" His happiness was so great that he feared it might not\nlast, and he asked the minister\'s son how best to conduct himself?\n\n"As a conqueror, my prince!" answered that astute young man, "if it so be that\nyou would be one. When you wish to win a woman, always impose upon her. Tell\nher that you are her master, and she will forthwith believe herself to be your\nservant. Inform her that she loves you, and forthwith she will adore you. Show\nher that you care nothing for her, and she will think of nothing but you.\nProve to her by your demeanour that you consider her a slave, and she will\nbecome your pariah. But above all things--excuse me if I repeat myself too\noften--beware of the fatal virtue which men call modesty and women\nsheepishness. Recollect the trouble it has given us, and the danger which we\nhave incurred: all this might have been managed at a tank within fifteen miles\nof your royal father\'s palace. And allow me to say that you may still thank\nyour stars: in love a lost opportunity is seldom if ever recovered. The time\nto woo a woman is the moment you meet her, before she has had time to think;\nallow her the use of reflection and she may escape the net. And after avoiding\nthe rock of Modesty, fall not, I conjure you, into the gulf of Security. I\nfear the lady Padmavati, she is too clever and too prudent. When damsels of\nher age draw the sword of Love, they throw away the scabbard of Precaution.\nBut you yawn--I weary you--it is time for us to move."\n\nTwo watches of the night had passed, and there was profound stillness on\nearth. The young men then walked quietly through the shadows, till they\nreached the western gate of the palace, and found the wicket ajar. The\nminister\'s son peeped in and saw the porter dozing, stately as a Brahman deep\nin the Vedas, and behind him stood a veiled woman seemingly waiting for\nsomebody. He then returned on tiptoe to the place where he had left his\nmaster, and with a parting caution against modesty and security, bade him\nfearlessly glide through the wicket. Then having stayed a short time at the\ngate listening with anxious ear, he went back to the old woman\'s house.\n\nVajramukut penetrating to the staircase, felt his hand grasped by the veiled\nfigure, who motioning him to tread lightly, led him quickly forwards. They\npassed under several arches, through dim passages and dark doorways, till at\nlast running up a flight of stone steps they reached the apartments of the\nprincess.\n\nVajramukut was nearly fainting as the flood of splendour broke upon him.\nRecovering himself he gazed around the rooms, and presently a tumult of\ndelight invaded his soul, and his body bristled with joy. [62] The scene was\nthat of fairyland. Golden censers exhaled the most costly perfumes, and gemmed\nvases bore the most beautiful flowers; silver lamps containing fragrant oil\nilluminated doors whose panels were wonderfully decorated, and walls adorned\nwith pictures in which such figures were formed that on seeing them the\nbeholder was enchanted. On one side of the room stood a bed of flowers and a\ncouch covered with brocade of gold, and strewed with freshly-culled jasmine\nflowers. On the other side, arranged in proper order, were attar holders,\nbetel-boxes, rose-water bottles, trays, and silver cases with four partitions\nfor essences compounded of rose leaves, sugar, and spices, prepared sandal\nwood, saffron, and pods of musk. Scattered about a stuccoed floor white as\ncrystal, were coloured caddies of exquisite confections, and in others\nsweetmeats of various kinds.[63] Female attendants clothed in dresses of\nvarious colours were standing each according to her rank, with hands\nrespectfully joined. Some were reading plays and beautiful poems, others\ndanced and others performed with glittering fingers and flashing arms on\nvarious instruments--the ivory lute, the ebony pipe and the silver kettledrum.\nIn short, all the means and appliances of pleasure and enjoyment were there;\nand any description of the appearance of the apartments, which were the wonder\nof the age, is impossible.\n\nThen another veiled figure, the beautiful Princess Padmavati, came up and\ndisclosed herself, and dazzled the eyes of her delighted Vajramukut. She led\nhim into an alcove, made him sit down, rubbed sandal powder upon his body,\nhung a garland of jasmine flowers round his neck, sprinkled rose-water over\nhis dress, and began to wave over his head a fan of peacock feathers with a\ngolden handle.\n\nSaid the prince, who despite all efforts could not entirely shake off his\nunhappy habit of being modest, "Those very delicate hands of yours are not fit\nto ply the pankha.[64] Why do you take so much trouble? I am cool and\nrefreshed by the sight of you. Do give the fan to me and sit down."\n\n"Nay, great king!" replied Padmavati, with the most fascinating of smiles,\n"you have taken so much trouble for my sake in coming here, it is right that I\nperform service for you."\n\nUpon which her favourite slave, taking the pankha from the hand of the\nprincess, exclaimed, "This is my duty. I will perform the service; do you two\nenjoy yourselves!"\n\nThe lovers then began to chew betel, which, by the bye, they disposed of in\nlittle agate boxes which they drew from their pockets, and they were soon\nengaged in the tenderest conversation.\n\nHere the Baital paused for a while, probably to take breath. Then he resumed\nhis tale as follows:\n\nIn the meantime, it became dawn; the princess concealed him; and when night\nreturned they again engaged in the same innocent pleasures. Thus day after day\nsped rapidly by. Imagine, if you can, the youth\'s felicity; he was of an\nardent temperament, deeply enamoured, barely a score of years old, and he had\nbeen strictly brought up by serious parents. He therefore resigned himself\nentirely to the siren for whom he willingly forgot the world, and he wondered\nat his good fortune, which had thrown in his way a conquest richer than all\nthe mines of Meru.[65] He could not sufficiently admire his Padmavati\'s grace,\nbeauty, bright wit, and numberless accomplishments. Every morning, for\nvanity\'s sake, he learned from her a little useless knowledge in verse as well\nas prose, for instance, the saying of the poet--\n\nEnjoy the present hour, \'tis shine; be this, O man, thy law; Who e\'er resew\nthe yester? Who the morrow e\'er foresaw?\n\nAnd this highly philosophical axiom--\n\nEat, drink, and love--the rest\'s not worth a fillip.\n\n"By means of which he hoped, Raja Vikram!" said the demon, not heeding his\nroyal carrier\'s "ughs" and "poohs," "to become in course of time almost as\nclever as his mistress."\n\nPadmavati, being, as you have seen, a maiden of superior mind, was naturally\nmore smitten by her lover\'s dulness than by any other of his qualities; she\nadored it, it was such a contrast to herself.[66] At first she did what many\nclever women do--she invested him with the brightness of her own imagination.\nStill water, she pondered, runs deep; certainly under this disguise must lurk\na brilliant fancy, a penetrating but a mature and ready judgment--are they not\nwritten by nature\'s hand on that broad high brow? With such lovely mustachios\ncan he be aught but generous, noble-minded, magnanimous? Can such eyes belong\nto any but a hero? And she fed the delusion. She would smile upon him with\nintense fondness, when, after wasting hours over a few lines of poetry, he\nwould misplace all the adjectives and barbarously entreat the metre. She\nlaughed with gratification, when, excited by the bright sayings that fell from\nher lips, the youth put forth some platitude, dim as the lamp in the expiring\nfire-fly. When he slipped in grammar she saw malice under it, when he retailed\na borrowed jest she called it a good one, and when he used--as princes\nsometimes will--bad language, she discovered in it a charming simplicity.\n\nAt first she suspected that the stratagems which had won her heart were the\nresults of a deep-laid plot proceeding from her lover. But clever women are\napt to be rarely sharp-sighted in every matter which concerns themselves. She\nfrequently determined that a third was in the secret. She therefore made no\nallusion to it. Before long the enamoured Vajramukut had told her everything,\nbeginning with the diatribe against love pronounced by the minister\'s son, and\nending with the solemn warning that she, the pretty princess, would some day\nor other play her husband a foul trick.\n\n"If I do not revenge myself upon him," thought the beautiful Padmavati,\nsmiling like an angel as she listened to the youth\'s confidence, "may I become\na gardener\'s ass in the next birth!"\n\nHaving thus registered a vow, she broke silence, and praised to the skies the\nyoung pradhan\'s wisdom and sagacity; professed herself ready from gratitude to\nbecome his slave, and only hoped that one day or other she might meet that\ntrue friend by whose skill her soul had been gratified in its dearest desire.\n"Only," she concluded, "I am convinced that now my Vajramukut knows every\ncorner of his little Padmavati\'s heart, he will never expect her to do\nanything but love, admire, adore and kiss him!\'\' Then suiting the action to\nthe word, she convinced him that the young minister had for once been too\ncrabbed and cynic in his philosophy.\n\nBut after the lapse of a month Vajramukut, who had eaten and drunk and slept a\ngreat deal too much, and who had not once hunted, became bilious in body and\nin mind melancholic. His face turned yellow, and so did the whites of his\neyes; he yawned, as liver patients generally do, complained occasionally of\nsick headaches, and lost his appetite: he became restless and anxious, and\nonce when alone at night he thus thought aloud: "I have given up country,\nthrone, home, and everything else, but the friend by means of whom this\nhappiness was obtained I have not seen for the long length of thirty days.\nWhat will he say to himself, and how can I know what has happened to him?"\n\nIn this state of things he was sitting, and in the meantime the beautiful\nprincess arrived. She saw through the matter, and lost not a moment in\nentering upon it. She began by expressing her astonishment at her lover\'s\nfickleness and fondness for change, and when he was ready to wax wroth, and\nquoted the words of the sage, "A barren wife may be superseded by another in\nthe eighth year; she whose children all die, in the tenth; she who brings\nforth only daughters, in the eleventh; she who scolds, without delay,"\nthinking that she alluded to his love, she smoothed his temper by explaining\nthat she referred to his forgetting his friend. "How is it possible, O my\nsoul," she asked with the softest of voices, that thou canst happiness here\nwhilst thy heart is wandering there? Why didst thou conceal this from me, O\nastute one? Was it for fear of distressing me? Think better of thy wife than\nto suppose that she would ever separate thee from one to whom we both owe so\nmuch!\n\n"After this Padmavati advised, nay ordered, her lover to go forth that night,\nand not to return till his mind was quite at ease, and she begged him to take\na few sweetmeats and other trifles as a little token of her admiration and\nregard for the clever young man of whom she had heard so much.\n\nVajramukut embraced her with a transport of gratitude, which so inflamed her\nanger, that fearing lest the cloak of concealment might fall from her\ncountenance, she went away hurriedly to find the greatest delicacies which her\ncomfit boxes contained. Presently she returned, carrying a bag of sweetmeats\nof every kind for her lover, and as he rose up to depart, she put into his\nhand a little parcel of sugar-plums especially intended for the friend; they\nwere made up with her own delicate fingers, and they would please, she\nflattered herself, even his discriminating palate.\n\nThe young prince, after enduring a number of farewell embraces and hopings for\na speedy return, and last words ever beginning again, passed safely through\nthe palace gate, and with a relieved aspect walked briskly to the house of the\nold nurse. Although it was midnight his friend was still sitting on his mat.\n\nThe two young men fell upon one another\'s bosoms and embraced affectionately.\nThey then began to talk of matters nearest their hearts. The Raja\'s son\nwondered at seeing the jaded and haggard looks of his companion, who did not\ndisguise that they were caused by his anxiety as to what might have happened\nto his friend at the hand of so talented and so superior a princess. Upon\nwhich Vajramukut, who now thought Padmavati an angel, and his late abode a\nheaven, remarked with formality--and two blunders to one quotation--that\nabilities properly directed win for a man the happiness of both worlds.\n\nThe pradhan\'s son rolled his head.\n\n"Again on your hobby-horse, nagging at talent whenever you find it in others!\n" cried the young prince with a pun, which would have delighted Padmavati.\n"Surely you are jealous of her!" he resumed, anything but pleased with the\ndead silence that had received his joke; "jealous of her cleverness, and of\nher love for me. She is the very best creature in the world. Even you, woman-\nhater as you are, would own it if you only knew all the kind messages she\nsent, and the little pleasant surprise that she has prepared for you. There!\ntake and eat; they are made by her own dear hands!" cried the young Raja,\nproducing the sweetmeats. "As she herself taught me to say -\n\nThank God I am a man, Not a philosopher!"\n\n"The kind messages she sent me! The pleasant surprise she has prepared for\nme!" repeated the minister\'s son in a hard, dry tone. "My lord will be pleased\nto tell me how she heard of my name?"\n\n"I was sitting one night," replied the prince, "in anxious thought about you,\nwhen at that moment the princess coming in and seeing my condition, asked,\n\'Why are you thus sad? Explain the cause to me.\' I then gave her an account of\nyour cleverness, and when she heard it she gave me permission to go and see\nyou, and sent these sweetmeats for you: eat them and I shall be pleased."\n\n"Great king!" rejoined the young statesman, "one thing vouchsafe to hear from\nme. You have not done well in that you have told my name. You should never let\na woman think that your left hand knows the secret which she confided to your\nright, much less that you have shared it to a third person. Secondly, you did\nevil in allowing her to see the affection with which you honour your unworthy\nservant--a woman ever hates her lover\'s or husband\'s friend."\n\n"What could I do?" rejoined the young Raja, in a querulous tone of voice.\n"When I love a woman I like to tell her everything--to have no secrets from\nher--to consider her another self----"\n\n"Which habit," interrupted the pradhan\'s son, "you will lose when you are a\nlittle older, when you recognize the fact that love is nothing but a bout, a\ngame of skill between two individuals of opposite sexes: the one seeking to\ngain as much, and the other striving to lose as little as possible; and that\nthe sharper of the twain thus met on the chessboard must, in the long run,\nwin. And reticence is but a habit. Practise it for a year, and you will find\nit harder to betray than to conceal your thoughts. It hath its joy also. Is\nthere no pleasure, think you, when suppressing an outbreak of tender but fatal\nconfidence in saying to yourself, \'O, if she only knew this?\' \'O, if she did\nbut suspect that?\' Returning, however, to the sugar-plums, my life to a\npariah\'s that they are poisoned!"\n\n"Impossible!" exclaimed the prince, horror-struck at the thought; "what you\nsay, surely no one ever could do. If a mortal fears not his fellow-mortal, at\nleast he dreads the Deity."\n\n"I never yet knew," rejoined the other, "what a woman in love does fear.\nHowever, prince, the trial is easy. Come here, Muti!" cried he to the old\nwoman\'s dog, "and off with thee to that three-headed kinsman of shine, that\nattends upon his amiable-looking master.[67]"\n\nHaving said this, he threw one of the sweetmeats to the dog; the animal ate\nit, and presently writhing and falling down, died.\n\n"The wretch! O the wretch!" cried Vajramukut, transported with wonder and\nanger. " And I loved her! But now it is all over. I dare not associate with\nsuch a calamity!"\n\n"What has happened, my lord, has happened!" quoth the minister\'s son calmly.\n"I was prepared for something of this kind from so talented a princess. None\ncommit such mistakes, such blunders, such follies as your clever women; they\ncannot even turn out a crime decently executed. O give me dulness with one\nidea, one aim, one desire. O thrice blessed dulness that combines with\nhappiness, power."\n\nThis time Vajramukut did not defend talent.\n\n"And your slave did his best to warn you against perfidy. But now my heart is\nat rest. I have tried her strength. She has attempted and failed; the defeat\nwill prevent her attempting again--just yet. But let me ask you to put to\nyourself one question. Can you be happy without her?"\n\n"Brother!" replied the prince, after a pause, "I cannot"; and he blushed as he\nmade the avowal.\n\n"Well," replied the other, "better confess then conceal that fact; we must now\nmeet her on the battle-field, and beat her at her own weapons--cunning. I do\nnot willingly begin treachery with women, because, in the first place, I don\'t\nlike it; and secondly, I know that they will certainly commence practicing it\nupon me, after which I hold myself justified in deceiving them. And probably\nthis will be a good wife; remember that she intended to poison me, not you.\nDuring the last month my fear has been lest my prince had run into the tiger\'s\nbrake. Tell me, my lord, when does the princess expect you to return to her?"\n\n"She bade me," said the young Raja, "not to return till my mind was quite at\nease upon the subject of m talented friend."\n\n"This means that she expects you back to-morrow night, as you cannot enter the\npalace before. And now I will retire to my cot, as it is there that I am wont\nto ponder over my plans. Before dawn my thought shall mature one which must\nplace the beautiful Padmavati in your power."\n\n"A word before parting," exclaimed the prince "you know my father has already\nchosen a spouse for me; what will he say if I bring home a second? "\n\n"In my humble opinion," said the minister\'s son rising to retire, "woman is a\nmonogamous, man a polygamous, creature, a fact scarcely established in physio-\nlogical theory, but very observable in every-day practice For what said the\npoet?--Divorce, friend! Re-wed thee! The spring draweth near,[68] And a wife\'s\nbut an almanac--good for the year.\n\nIf your royal father say anything to you, refer him to what he himself does."\n\nReassured by these words, Vajramukut bade his friend a cordial good-night and\nsought his cot, where he slept soundly, despite the emotions of the last few\nhours. The next day passed somewhat slowly. In the evening, when accompanying\nhis master to the palace, the minister\'s son gave him the following\ndirections.\n\n"Our object, dear my lord, is how to obtain possession of the princess. Take,\nthen, this trident, and hide it carefully when you see her show the greatest\nlove and affection. Conceal what has happened, and when she, wondering at your\ncalmness, asks about me, tell her that last night I was weary and out of\nhealth, that illness prevented my eating her sweetmeats, but that I shall eat\nthem for supper to-night. When she goes to sleep, then, taking off her jewels\nand striking her left leg with the trident, instantly come away to me. But\nshould she lie awake, rub upon your thumb a little of this--do not fear, it is\nonly a powder of grubs fed on verdigris--and apply it to her nostrils. It\nwould make an elephant senseless, so be careful how you approach it to your\nown face."\n\nVajramukut embraced his friend, and passed safely through the palace gate. He\nfound Padmavati awaiting him; she fell upon his bosom and looked into his\neyes, and deceived herself, as clever women will do. Overpowered by her joy\nand satisfaction, she now felt certain that her lover was hers eternally, and\nthat her treachery had not been discovered; so the beautiful princess fell\ninto a deep sleep.\n\nThen Vajramukut lost no time in doing as the minister\'s son had advised, and\nslipped out of the room, carrying off Padmavati\'s jewels and ornaments. His\ncounsellor having inspected them, took up a sack and made signs to his master\nto follow him. Leaving the horses and baggage at the nurse\'s house, they\nwalked to a burning-place outside the city. The minister\'s son there buried\nhis dress, together with that of the prince, and drew from the sack the\ncostume of a religious ascetic: he assumed this himself, and gave to his\ncompanion that of a disciple. Then quoth the guru (spiritual preceptor) to his\nchela (pupil), "Go, youth, to the bazar, and sell these jewels, remembering to\nlet half the jewellers in the place see the things, and if any one lay hold of\nthee, bring him to me."\n\nUpon which, as day had dawned, Vajramukut carried the princess\'s ornaments to\nthe market, and entering the nearest goldsmith\'s shop, offered to sell them,\nand asked what they were worth. As your majesty well knows, gardeners,\ntailors, and goldsmiths are proverbially dishonest, and this man was no\nexception to the rule. He looked at the pupil\'s face and wondered, because he\nhad brought articles whose value he did not appear to know. A thought struck\nhim that he might make a bargain which would fill his coffers, so he offered\nabout a thousandth part of the price. This the pupil rejected, because he\nwished the affair to go further. Then the goldsmith, seeing him about to\ndepart, sprang up and stood in the door way, threatening to call the officers\nof justice if the young man refused to give up the valuables which he said had\nlately been stolen from his shop. As the pupil only laughed at this, the\ngoldsmith thought seriously of executing his threat, hesitating only because\nhe knew that the officers of justice would gain more than he could by that\nproceeding. As he was still in doubt a shadow darkened his shop, and in\nentered the chief jeweller of the city. The moment the ornaments were shown to\nhim he recognized them, and said, "These jewels belong to Raja Dantawat\'s\ndaughter; I know them well, as I set them only a few months ago!" Then he\nturned to the disciple, who still held the valuables in his hand, and cried,\n"Tell me truly whence you received them?"\n\nWhile they were thus talking, a crowd of ten or twenty persons had collected,\nand at length the report reached the superintendent of the archers. He sent a\nsoldier to bring before him the pupil, the goldsmith, and the chief jeweller,\ntogether with the ornaments. And when all were in the hall of justice, he\nlooked at the jewels and said to the young man, "Tell me truly, whence have\nyou obtained these?"\n\n"My spiritual preceptor," said Vajramukut, pretending great fear, "who is now\nworshipping in the cemetery outside the town, gave me these white stones, with\nan order to sell them. How know I whence he obtained them? Dismiss me, my\nlord, for I am an innocent man."\n\n"Let the ascetic be sent for," commanded the kotwal.[69] Then, having taken\nboth of them, along with the jewels, into the presence of King Dantawat, he\nrelated the whole circumstances.\n\n"Master," said the king on hearing the statement, "whence have you obtained\nthese jewels?"\n\nThe spiritual preceptor, before deigning an answer, pulled from under his arm\nthe hide of a black antelope, which he spread out and smoothed deliberately\nbefore using it as an asan.[70] He then began to finger a rosary of beads each\nas large as an egg, and after spending nearly an hour in mutterings and in\nrollings of the head, he looked fixedly at the Raja, and repined:\n\n"By Shiva! great king, they are mine own. On the fourteenth of the dark half\nof the moon at night, I had gone into a place where dead bodies are burned,\nfor the purpose of accomplishing a witch\'s incantation. After long and\ntoilsome labour she appeared, but her demeanour was so unruly that I was\nforced to chastise her. I struck her with this, my trident, on the left leg,\nif memory serves me. As she continued to be refractory, in order to punish her\nI took off all her jewels and clothes, and told her to go where she pleased.\nEven this had little effect upon her--never have I looked upon so perverse a\nwitch. In this way the jewels came into my possession."\n\nRaja Dantawat was stunned by these words. He begged the ascetic not to leave\nthe palace for a while, and forthwith walked into the private apartments of\nthe women. Happening first to meet the queen dowager, he said to her, "Go,\nwithout losing a minute, O my mother, and look at Padmavati\'s left leg, and\nsee if there is a mark or not, and what sort of a mark!" Presently she\nreturned, and coming to the king said, "Son, I find thy daughter lying upon\nher bed, and complaining that she has met with an accident; and indeed\nPadmavati must be in great pain. I found that some sharp instrument with three\npoints had wounded her. The girl says that a nail hurt her, but I never yet\nheard of a nail making three holes. However, we must all hasten, or there will\nbe erysipelas, tumefaction, gangrene, mortification, amputation, and perhaps\ndeath in the house," concluded the old queen, hurrying away in the pleasing\nanticipation of these ghastly consequences.\n\nFor a moment King Dantawat\'s heart was ready to break. But he was accustomed\nto master his feelings; he speedily applied the reins of reflection to the\nwild steed of passion. He thought to himself, "the affairs of one\'s household,\nthe intentions of one\'s heart, and whatever one\'s losses may be, should not be\ndisclosed to any one. Since Padmavati is a witch, she is no longer my\ndaughter. I will verily go forth and consult the spiritual preceptor."\n\nWith these words the king went outside, where the guru was still sitting upon\nhis black hide, making marks with his trident on the floor. Having requested\nthat the pupil might be sent away, and having cleared the room, he said to the\njogi, "O holy man! what punishment for the heinous crime of witchcraft is\nawarded to a woman in the Dharma- Shastra [71]?"\n\n"Greet king!" replied the devotee, "in the Dharma Shastra it is thus written:\n\'If a Brahman, a cow, a woman, a child, or any other person whatsoever who may\nbe dependent on us, should be guilty of a perfidious act, their punishment is\nthat they be banished the country.\' However much they may deserve death, we\nmust not spill their blood, as Lakshmi[72] flies in horror from the deed."\n\nHearing these words the Raja dismissed the guru with many thanks and large\npresents. He waited till nightfall and then ordered a band of trusty men to\nseize Padmavati without alarming the household, and to carry her into a\ndistant jungle full of fiends, tigers, and bears, and there to abandon her.\n\nIn the meantime, the ascetic and his pupil hurrying to the cemetery resumed\ntheir proper dresses; they then went to the old nurse\'s house, rewarded her\nhospitality till she wept bitterly, girt on their weapons, and mounting their\nhorses, followed the party which issued from the gate of King Dantawat\'s\npalace. And it may easily be believed that they found little difficulty in\npersuading the poor girl to exchange her chance in the wild jungle for the\nprospect of becoming Vajramukut\'s wife--lawfully wedded at Benares. She did\nnot even ask if she was to have a rival in the house,--a question which women,\nyou know, never neglect to put under usual circumstances. After some days the\ntwo pilgrims of one love arrived at the house of their fathers, and to all,\nboth great and small, excess in joy came.\n\n"Now, Raja Vikram!" said the Baital, "you have not spoken much; doubtless you\nare engrossed by the interest of a story wherein a man beats a woman at her\nown weapon--deceit. But I warn you that you will assuredly fall into Narak\n(the infernal regions) if you do not make up your mind upon and explain this\nmatter. Who was the most to blame amongst these four? the lover[73] the\nlover\'s friend, the girl, or the father?"\n\n"For my part I think Padmavati was the worst, she being at the bottom of all\ntheir troubles," cried Dharma Dhwaj. The king said something about young\npeople and the two senses of seeing and hearing, but his son\'s sentiment was\nso sympathetic that he at once pardoned the interruption. At length,\ndetermined to do justice despite himself, Vikram said, "Raja Dantawat is the\nperson most at fault."\n\n"In what way was he at fault? " asked the Baital curiously.\n\nKing Vikram gave him this reply: "The Prince Vajramukut being tempted of the\nlove-god was insane, and therefore not responsible for his actions. The\nminister\'s son performed his master\'s business obediently, without considering\ncauses or asking questions--a very excellent quality in a dependent who is\nmerely required to do as he is bid. With respect to the young woman, I have\nonly to say that she was a young woman, and thereby of necessity a possible\nmurderess. But the Raja, a prince, a man of a certain age and experience, a\nfather of eight! He ought never to have been deceived by so shallow a trick,\nnor should he, without reflection, have banished his daughter from the\ncountry."\n\n"Gramercy to you!" cried the Vampire, bursting into a discordant shout of\nlaughter, "I now return to my tree. By my tail! I never yet heard a Raja so\nreadily condemn a Raja." With these words he slipped out of the cloth, leaving\nit to hang empty over the great king\'s shoulder.\n\nVikram stood for a moment, fixed to the spot with blank dismay. Presently,\nrecovering himself, he retraced his steps, followed by his son, ascended the\nsires-tree, tore down the Baital, packed him up as before, and again set out\nupon his way.\n\nSoon afterwards a voice sounded behind the warrior king\'s back, and began to\ntell another true story.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Vampire\'s Second Story.
