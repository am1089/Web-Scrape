Gurus, i.e. parents and other\nvenerable persons.\n\n[265:5](sbe0281.htm#fr_1298) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 6, 18, 14.\n\n[265:6](sbe0281.htm#fr_1299) Manu IV, 253; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 166.\n\n[266:7](sbe0281.htm#fr_1300) E.g. a man who sells pots, but does not make\nthem.\n\n[266:8](sbe0281.htm#fr_1301) Manu III, 104; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 112.\n\n[266:9](sbe0281.htm#fr_1302) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 16, 23, 26.\n\n[266:10](sbe0281.htm#fr_1303) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 16, 27, 30. Haradatta explains\n\'a black bird\' by \'a crow,\' and no doubt the crow, as the _K_ a _n_ _d_ ala\namong birds, is intended in the first instance.\n\n[266:11](sbe0281.htm#fr_1304) Manu IV, 208; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 167.\n\n[266:12](sbe0281.htm#fr_1305) Manu IV, 209; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 168.\n\n[266:13](sbe0281.htm#fr_1306) \'What has been given in a contemptuous manner by\nthe host, or what is not pleasing to the eater, that is called bhavadush _t_\na, "naturally bad."\'--Haradatta. The second seems to be the right explanation,\nas food falling under the first is mentioned below, Sutra 21.\n\n[266:14](sbe0281.htm#fr_1307) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 17, 18, 20.\n\n[266:15](sbe0281.htm#fr_1308) Haradatta states that this rule does not refer\nto dishes the preparation of which requires a double cooking, but to those\nwhich ordinarily are cooked once only.\n\n[266:16](sbe0281.htm#fr_1309) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 17, 17. Haradatta says that food\nprepared p. 267 for the morning meal and kept until supper is also called\nparvushita, \'stale.\'\n\n[267:17](sbe0281.htm#fr_1310) For this and the following Sutras, see \xc3\x82pastamba\nI, 6, 18, 16-1, 6, 19, 1; Manu IV, 205-217; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 161-165. An\nAbhi _s_ asta is a person who is wrongly or falsely accused of a heinous\ncrime, see \xc3\x82pastamba I, 91 24, 6-9. Haradatta adduces the explanation\n\'hermaphrodite\' for anapade _s_ ya as the opinion of others. He himself thinks\nthat it means \'a person not worthy to be described or named.\' \'One who hunts\nwithout using the bow\' is a poacher who snares animals. Snaring animals is a\nfavourite occupation of the non-Aryan tribes, such as Vaghris, Bhils, and\nKolis.\n\n[267:18](sbe0281.htm#fr_1311) See above, XV, 15-18, where \'bald men\' occupy\nthe fourteenth place in Sutra 18.\n\n[267:19](sbe0281.htm#fr_1312) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 17, 3; Manu IV, 212. That is\ncalled \'food (prepared) for no (sacred) purpose which a man cooks only for\nhimself, not for guests and the rest, see \xc3\x82pastamba II, 4, 8, 4; Manu V, 7.\n\n[267:20](sbe0281.htm#fr_1313) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 17, 2.\n\n[268:21](sbe0281.htm#fr_1314) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 17, 4.\n\n[268:22](sbe0281.htm#fr_1315)-23. \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 17, 24\n\n[268:24](sbe0281.htm#fr_1316) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 17, 23.\n\n[268:25](sbe0281.htm#fr_1317) \xc3\x82pastamba, I, 5, 17, 23\n\n[268:26](sbe0281.htm#fr_1318) Manu V, 8; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 170.\n\n[268:27](sbe0281.htm#fr_1319) \xc3\x82pastamba. I, 5, 17, 37.\n\n[268:28](sbe0281.htm#fr_1320) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 17, 29, 33, 35. Haradatta gives\nas an example of \'animals covered with an excessive quantity of hair\' the Yak\nor Bos grunniens, and of \'those that have no hair\' snakes and the like.\n\n[269:29](sbe0281.htm#fr_1321) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 17, 29, 32, 34, 35; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya I, 173.\n\n[269:30](sbe0281.htm#fr_1322) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 17, 29-30.\n\n[269:31](sbe0281.htm#fr_1323) Aitareya-brahma _n_ a VII, 14. For the\nexplanation of v _ri_ tha-ma _m_ sa, \'the flesh (of animals killed) for no\n(sacred) purpose,\' Haradatta refers back to Sutra 19, but see also the\nPetersburg Dict. s. v. v _ri_ tha.\n\n[269:32](sbe0281.htm#fr_1324) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 17, 26, 29; Manu V, 5, 6, 19.\n\n[269:34](sbe0281.htm#fr_1325) Manu V, 12; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 173, Haradatta\nexplains mandhala by vagvada, which seems to be the same as the bird vagguda,\n(Manu XII, 64). Mandhala is not found in our dictionaries, but it apparently\nis a vicarious form for manthala, which occurs in the Va _g_ asaneyi-Sa _m_\nhita and is said to be the name of a kind of mouse or rat, It seems to me that\nthe large herbivorous bat, usually called the flying fox (in Gu _g_ arati\nvagud or vagul) is really meant, which, by an inaccurate observer, might be\ndescribed both as a bird and as a kind of rat. See also Vasish _th_ a XIV, 48.\n\n[269:35](sbe0281.htm#fr_1326) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 17, 32-33.\n\n[269:36](sbe0281.htm#fr_1327) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 17, 38-39.\n\n[270:37](sbe0281.htm#fr_1328) I.e. animals offered at _S_ raddhas and _S_\nrauta-sacrifices, though under other circumstances forbidden, may be eaten\nboth by the priests and other Brahma _n_ as.\n\n[270:38](sbe0281.htm#fr_1329) Haradatta takes vyala, \'beasts of prey,\' to mean\nsporting dogs, which no doubt are also intended.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XVIII](sbe0282.htm)\n\n'
