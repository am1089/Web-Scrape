Because it denotes the world.\n\nThe Sa _n_ khya comes forward with a further objection. Although the Vedanta-\ntexts teach an intelligent principle to be the cause of the world, they do not\npresent to us as objects of knowledge anything that could be the cause of\n\np. 378\n\nthe world, apart from the Pradhana and the soul as established by the Sa _n_\nkhya-system. For the Kaushitakins declare in their text, in the dialogue of\nBalaki and A _g_ ata _s_ atru, that none but the enjoying(individual) soul is\nto be known as the cause of the world, \'Shall I tell you Brahman? He who is\nthe maker of those persons and of whom this is the work (or "to whom this work\nbelongs") he indeed is to be known\' (Kau. Up. IV, 19). Balaki at the outset\nproposes Brahman as the object of instruction, and when he is found himself\nnot to know Brahman, A _g_ ata _s_ atru instructs him about it, \'he indeed is\nto be known.\' But from the relative clause \'to whom this work belongs,\' which\nconnects the being to be known with work, we infer that by Brahman we have\nhere to understand the enjoying soul which is the ruler of Prak _ri_ ti, not\nany other being. For no other being is connected with work; work, whether\nmeritorious or the contrary, belongs to the individual soul only. Nor must you\ncontest this conclusion on the ground that \'work\' is here to be explained as\nmeaning the object of activity, so that the sense of the clause would be \'he\nof whom this entire world, as presented by perception and the other means of\nknowledge, is the work.\' For in that case the separate statements made in the\ntwo clauses, \'who is the maker of those persons\' and \'of whom this is the\nwork,\' would be devoid of purport(the latter implying the former). Moreover,\nthe generally accepted meaning of the word \'karman,\' both in Vedic and worldly\nspeech, is work in the sense of good and evil actions. And as the origination\nof the world is caused by actions of the various individual souls, the\ndesignation of \'maker of those persons\' also suits only the individual soul.\nThe meaning of the whole passage therefore is \'He who is the cause of the\ndifferent persons that have their abode in the disc of the sun, and so on, and\nare instrumental towards the retributive experiences of the individual souls;\nand to whom there belongs karman, good and evil, to which there is due his\nbecoming such a cause; _he_ indeed is to be known, _his_ essential nature is\nto be cognised in distinction from Prak _ri_ ti.\' And also in what follows,\n\'The two came to a person who was asleep. He\n\np. 379\n\npushed him with a stick,\' &c., what is said about the sleeping man being\npushed, roused, &c., all points only to the individual soul being the topic of\ninstruction. Further on also the text treats of the individual soul only, \'As\nthe master feeds with his people, nay as his people feed on the master, thus\ndoes this conscious Self feed with the other Selfs.\' We must consider also the\nfollowing passage--which contains the explanation given by A _g_ ata _s_ atru\nto Balaki, who had been unable to say where the soul goes at the time of deep\nsleep--\' There are the arteries called Hitas. In these the person is; when\nsleeping he sees no dream, then he ( _or_ that, i.e. the aggregate of the\nsense-organs) becomes one with this pra _n_ a alone. Then speech goes to him\nwith all names,&c., the mind with all thoughts. And when he awakes, then, as\nfrom a burning fire sparks proceed in all directions, thus from that Self the\npra _n_ as proceed each towards its place, from the pra _n_ as the gods, from\nthe gods the worlds.\' The individual soul which passes through the states of\ndream, deep sleep and waking, and is that into which there are merged and from\nwhich there proceed speech and all the other organs, is here declared to be\nthe abode of deep sleep \'then it (viz. the aggregate of the organs) becomes\none in that pra _n_ a.\' Pra _n_ a here means the individual soul in so far as\nsupporting life; for the text continues \'when _that_ one awakes\' and neither\nthe vital breath nor the Lord (both of whom might be proposed as explanations\nof pra _n_ a) can be said to be asleep and to wake. Or else \'asmin pra _n_ e\'\nmight be explained as \'in the vital breath (which abides) in the individual\nsoul,\' the meaning of the clause being \'all the organs, speech and so on,\nbecome one in the vital breath which itself abides in this soul.\' The word\n\'pra _n_ a\' would thus be taken in its primary literal sense; yet all the same\nthe soul constitutes the topic of the section, the vital breath being a mere\ninstrument of the soul. The Brahman mentioned at the outset therefore is none\nother than the individual soul, and there is nothing to prove a lord different\nfrom it. And as the attributes which the texts ascribe to the general cause,\nviz. thought and so on, are attributes of\n\np. 380\n\nintelligent beings only, we arrive at the conclusion that what constitutes the\ncause of the world is the non-intelligent Pradhana guided by the intelligent\nsoul.\n\nThis prima facie view the Sutra disposes of, by saying \'because (the work)\ndenotes the world.\' It is not the insignificant individual soul--which is\nunder the influence of its good and evil works, and by erroneously imputing to\nitself the attributes of Prak _ri_ ti becomes the cause of the effects of the\nlatter--that is the topic of our text; but rather the Supreme Person who is\nfree from all shadow of imperfection such as Nescience and the like, who is a\ntreasure of all possible auspicious qualities in their highest degree of\nperfection, who is the sole cause of this entire world. This is proved by the\ncircumstance that the term \'work\' connected with \'this\' (in \'of whom this (is)\nthe work\') denotes the Universe which is an effect of the Supreme Person. For\nthe word \'this\' must, on account of its sense, the general topic of the\nsection and so on, be taken in a non-limited meaning, and hence denotes the\nentire world, as presented by Perception and the other means of knowledge,\nwith all its sentient and non-sentient beings. That the term \'work\' does not\nhere denote good and evil actions, appears from the following consideration of\nthe context. Balaki at first offers to teach Brahman (\'Shall I tell you\nBrahman?\') and thereupon holds forth on various persons abiding in the sun,\nand so on, as being Brahman. A _g_ ata _s_ atru however refuses to accept this\ninstruction as not setting forth Brahman, and finally, in order to enlighten\nBalaki, addresses him \'He, O Balaki, who is the maker of those persons,\' &c.\nNow as the different personal souls abiding in the sun, &c., and connected\nwith karman in the form of good and evil actions, are known already by Balaki,\nthe term \'karman\'- met with in the next clause--is clearly meant to throw\nlight on some Person so far not known to Balaki, and therefore must be taken\nto mean not good and evil deeds or action in general, but rather the entire\nUniverse in so far as being the outcome of activity. On this interpretation\nonly the passage gives instruction about something not\n\np. 381\n\nknown before. Should it be said that this would be the case also if the\nsubject to which the instruction refers were the true essential nature of the\nsoul, indicated here by its connexion with karman, we reply that this would\ninvolve the (objectionable) assumption of so-called implication (laksha _n_\na), in so far namely as what the clause would directly intimate is (not the\nessential nature of the soul as free from karman but rather) the connexion of\nthe soul with karman. Moreover if the intention of the passage were this, viz.\nto give instruction as to the soul, the latter being pointed at by means of\nthe reference to karman, the intention would be fully accomplished by saying\n\'to whom karman belongs, he is to be known;\' while in the text as it actually\nstands \'of whom this is the karman\' the \'this\' would be unmeaning. The meaning\nof the two separate clauses \'who is the maker of those persons\' and \'of whom\nthis is the work\' is as follows. He who is the creator of those persons whom\nyou called Brahman, and of whom those persons are the creatures; he of whom\nthis entire world is the effect, and before whom all things sentient and non-\nsentient are equal in so far as being produced by him; he, the highest and\nuniversal cause, the Supreme Person, is the object to be known. The meaning\nimplied here is--although the origination of the world has for its condition\nthe deeds of individual souls, yet those souls do not independently originate\nthe means for their own retributive experience, but experience only what the\nLord has created to that end in agreement with their works. The individual\nsoul, hence, cannot stand in creative relation to those persons.--What the\ntext under discussion inculcates as the object of knowledge therefore is the\nhighest Brahman which is known from all Vedanta-texts as the universal cause.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 17....the inferential marks of the individual soul and the chief vital\nair](sbe48159.htm)\n\n'
