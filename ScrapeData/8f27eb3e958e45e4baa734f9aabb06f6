A woman is not defiled by a lover, nor a Brahma _n_ a by Vedic rites, nor\nwater by urine and ordure, nor fire by consuming (impure substances). 1\n\np. 133\n\n2-3. A wife, (though) tainted by sin, whether she be quarrelsome, or have left\nthe house, or have suffered criminal force, or have fallen into the hands of\nthieves, must not be abandoned; to forsake her is not prescribed (by the\nsacred law). Let him wait for the time of her courses; by her temporary\nuncleanness she becomes pure. 2\n\n4\\. Women (possess) an unequalled means of purification; they never become\n(entirely) foul. For month by month their temporary uncleanness removes their\nsins. 4\n\n5\\. Women belong first to three gods, Soma (the moon), the Gandharva, and\nFire, and come afterwards into the possession of men; according to the law\nthey cannot be contaminated. 5\n\n6\\. Soma gave them cleanliness, the Gandharva their melodious voice, and Fire\npurity of all (limbs); therefore women are free from stains. 6\n\n7\\. Those versed in the sacred law state that there are three acts (only)\nwhich make women outcasts, (viz.) the murder of the husband, slaying a learned\nBrahma _n_ a, and the destruction of the fruit of their womb. 7\n\n8\\. A calf is pure when the milk flows, a bird when it causes fruit to fall,\nwomen during dalliance, and a dog when he catches a deer. 8\n\n9\\. Pure is the mouth of a goat and of a horse, pure is the back of a cow,\npure are the feet of a Brahma _n_ a, but women are pure in all (limbs) 9\n\np. 134\n\n10\\. I will now declare the purificatory texts (which are found) in each Veda;\nby muttering them or reciting them at a burnt-oblation (men) are doubtlessly\ncleansed (from sin). 10\n\n11\\. (They are) the Aghamarsha _n_ a, the Devak _ri_ ta, the _S_ uddhavatis,\nthe Taratsamas, the _K_ ushma _n_ _d_ as, the Pavamanis, and the Durgasavitri;\n\n12\\. The Atisha\xe1\xb9\x85gas, the Padastobhas, and the Samans (called) Vyah _ri_ ti,\nthe Bharu _n_ _d_ a Samans, the Gayatra (Saman), and the Raivata; 12\n\n13\\. The Purushavrata and the Bhasa, and likewise the Devavrata (Samans), the\nAbli\xe1\xb9\x85ga, the Barhaspatya, the hymn addressed to Va _k_ , likewise the _Ri_ _k_\nas (called) Madhu; 13\n\n14\\. The _S_ atarudriya, the Atharva _s_ iras, the Trisupar _n_ a, the\nMahavrata, the Gosukta, and the A _s_ vasukta, and the two Samans (called)\nSuddha _s_ uddhiya. 14\n\n15\\. The three (Samans called) \xc3\x82 _g_ yadohas, the Rathantara, the Agnervrata,\nthe Vamadevya, and the B _ri_ hat, being muttered, purify (all) living beings.\n(He who sings them) may obtain the recollection of former existences, if he\ndesires it.\n\n16\\. Gold is the firstborn of Fire, through Vish _n_ u exists the earth, and\nthe cows are children of the\n\np. 135\n\n[paragraph continues] Sun; he who bestows as gifts gold, a cow, and land will\nobtain rewards without end for them.\n\n17\\. A cow, a horse, gold, (and) land, bestowed on an unlearned Brahma _n_ a\nwho neglects his sacred duties, prevent the giver (from attaining heaven). 17\n\n18-19. (If he presents), on the full moon of the month of Vai _s_ akha, (to)\nseven or five Brahma _n_ as, black or white sesamum grains (mixed) with honey,\n(saying), 'May the king of justice (Yama) rejoice!' or (expressing) some other\n(wish) which he may have in his mind, the guilt which he has incurred during\nhis (whole) life will instantly vanish.\n\n20\\. But hear (now) the reward of the merit acquired by that man who gives the\nskin of a black antelope, to which the hoofs are (still) attached and the\nnavel of which is adorned with gold, covering it with sesamum grains. 20\n\n21\\. 'Without doubt he has bestowed (through that gift) the four-faced earth,\ntogether with its caves filled with gold, and together with its mountains,\ngroves, and forests.' 21\n\n22\\. He who, placing on the skin of a black antelope, sesamum, gold, honey,\nand butter, gives it to a Brahma _n_ a, overcomes all sin.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[132:1](sbe1431.htm#fr_700) **XXVIII**.
