This portion of the work treats of the ordinary forms of the most\nsacred of Vedic sacrificial rites, the \'Soma-sacrifice.\' The exposition of the\nSoma-ritual also includes an account of the animal offering which, though it\nmay be performed as an independent sacrifice, more usually constitutes an\nintegral part of the Saumya-adhvara.\n\nSince F. Windischmann, in his treatise \'Ueber den Somacultus der Arier\'\n(1846), pointed out the remarkable similarity of conceptions prevalent among\nthe ancient Indians and Iranians in regard to the Soma, both from a\nsacrificial and a mythological point of view, this subject has repeatedly\nengaged the attention of scholars. In A. Kuhn\'s masterly essay, \'Die\nHerabkunft des Feuers and des Gottertranks\' (1859), the Soma-myth was\nthoroughly investigated, and its roots were traced far back into the Indo-\nEuropean antiquity. Within the last few years the entire Rig-vedic conceptions\nregarding Soma have, for the first time, been subjected to a searching\nexamination in M. A. Bergaigne\'s \'La Religion Vedique.\' This book forms an\nimportant contribution to the interpretation of the Vedic hymns; and though\nthe combinations and theories put forth by the author may not always commend\nthemselves to scholars generally, there can be no doubt that his enquiries\nexhibit a rare analytic faculty, and have yielded a mass of new and valuable\nsuggestions.\n\nAmong the numerous features which the Vedic \xc3\x82ryans had in common with their\nIranian kinsmen, and from which it is supposed that an intimate connection\nmust have subsisted\n\np. xii\n\nbetween these two easternmost branches of the Indo-European stock for some\ntime after they had become separated from their western brethren, the Soma\ncult and myth are not the least striking. Both the Vedic soma and the Zend\nhaoma--derived from the root su (Zend hu), \'to press, produce\'--denote in the\nfirst place a spirituous liquor extracted from a certain plant, described as\ngrowing on the mountains; the words being then naturally applied to the plant\nitself. But the Rig-veda, not less than the Avesta, distinguishes between an\nearthly and a celestial Soma; and it is precisely the relation between these\ntwo, or the descent of the heavenly Soma to the world of men, which forms the\ncentral element of the Soma-myth. To the childlike intellect of the primitive\n\xc3\x82ryan which knew not how to account for the manifold strange and awe-inspiring\nphenomena of nature otherwise than by peopling the universe with a thousand\ndivine agents, the potent juice of the Soma-plant which endowed the feeble\nmortal with godlike powers, and for a time freed him from earthly cares and\ntroubles, seemed a veritable god, not less worthy of adoration than the\nwielder of the thunderbolt, the roaring wind, or the vivifying orb of day. The\nsame magic powers are, upon the whole, ascribed to Soma by the Indian and\nPersian bards: to both of them he is the wise friend and mighty protector of\nhis votary, the inspirer of heroic deeds of arms as well as of the flights of\nfancy and song, the bestowcr of health, long life, and even immortality. The\ndivine personality of Soma, it is true, is, even for Vedic imagery, of an\nextremely vague and shadowy character; but it is difficult to see what plastic\nconception there could be of a deity whose chief activity apparently consists\nin mingling his fiery male nature with the teeming waters of the sky, and the\nswelling sap of plants. The principal cause, however, of the vagueness of\nSoma\'s personality, and the source of considerable difficulties in explaining\nmany of the Vedic conceptions of this deity, is his twofold nature as a fiery\nliquor, or liquid fire,--that is to say, his fluid and his fiery or luminous\nnature.\n\np. xiii\n\nThe Soma, with whom the worshipper is chiefly concerned, is the Soma-plant,\nand the juice extracted from it for the holy service. This is the earthly\nSoma, or, so to speak, the Avatar of the divine Soma. The latter, on the other\nhand, is a luminous deity, a source of light and life. In the Brahma _n_ as,\nSoma, in this respect, has become completely identified with the Moon, whose\nvarying phases, and temporary obscuration at the time of new-moon, favoured\nthe mystic notions of his serving as food 1 to the Gods and Fathers (Manes);\nand of his periodical descents to the earth, with the view of sexual union\nwith the waters and plants, and his own regeneration 2. Though this\nidentification appears already clearly in several passages of the _Ri_ k,\nVedic scholars seem mostly inclined to refer this conception to a secondary\nstage of development 3. According to Professor Roth, indeed, this\nidentification would have no other mythological foundation than the\ncoincidence of notions which finds its expression in the term indu 4 (commonly\nused for Soma, and in the later language for the moon), viz. as \'a drop\' and\n\'a spark (drop of light).\' This is not unlikely, but it does not of course\nhelp us to settle the point as to how that term came ultimately to be applied\nexclusively to the moon among heavenly luminaries. To the Vedic poet it is\nrather the sun that appears, if not identical, at any rate closely connected,\nwith the divine Soma. The fact was first pointed out by Grassmann 5, who\nproposed to identify Pavamana, the \'pure-streamed, sparkling\' Soma, with the,\napparently solar, deity Puemuno of the\n\np. xiv\n\n[paragraph continues] Iguvian tablets. M. Bergaigne has also carefully\ncollected the passages of the _Ri_ k in which Soma appears either compared or\nidentified with the sun. Although a mere comparison of Indu-Soma with the sun\ncan scarcely be considered sufficient evidence on this point, since such a\ncomparison might naturally enough suggest itself even to one who had the\nidentity of Soma and the moon in his mind, there still remain not a few\npassages where no such ambiguity seems possible. Somewhat peculiar are the\nrelations between Soma and Surya\'s daughter (probably the Dawn), alluded to\nseveral times 1 in the _Ri_ k. In one passage (IX, I, 6) she is said to pass\nSurya through the perpetual filter ( _s_ a _s_ vat vara); whilst in another\n(IX, 113, 8) \'Surya\'s daughter brought the bull (Soma?), reared by Par _g_\nanya (the cloud); the Gandharvas seized him and put him, as sap, into the Soma\n(plant?).\' A combination of this female bearer of Soma with the eagle (or\nfalcon) who carried off Soma (IV, 27, &c.) seems to have supplied the form of\nthe myth, current in the Brahma _n_ as, according to which Gayatri fetched\nSoma from heaven. The hymn X, 85 2, on the other hand, celebrates the marriage\nceremony of Soma and Surya, at which the two A _s_ vins act as bride\'smen, and\nAgni as the leader of the bridal procession to the bridegroom\'s home.\n\nThere are, however, other passages in the Rig-veda, in which Soma, so far from\nbeing identified with the sun, seems to be regarded as some sovereign power\nwhich originates or controls that luminary, as well as the other lights of\nheaven. Thus in Rig-veda IX, 61, 16 Soma is represented as producing ( _g_\nanaya _n_ ) the bright light belonging to all men; in IX, 97, 41 as producing\nthe light in the sun (a _g_ anayat surye _g_ yotir indu _h_ ); in IX, 28, 5;\n37, 4 as causing the sun to shine (ro _k_ ayan); in IX, 86, 22; 107, 7 as\nmaking him rise (a-rohayan) in the sky; in IX, 63, 6\n\np. xv\n\nas harnessing Svar\'s Eta _s_ a; in IX, 36, 3; 49, 5 as causing the lights to\nshine (gyoti _m_ shi vi-ro _k_ ayan; pratnavad ro _k_ ayan ru _k_ a _h_ ); in\nIX, 42, 1 as producing the lights of the sky (and) the sun in the (heavenly)\nwaters; in IX, 41, 5 as filling the two wide worlds (rodasi), even as the\ndawn, as the sun, with his rays. Nay, the poet of IX, 86, 29, \'Thou art the\n(heavenly) ocean (samudra) . . . thine are the lights ( _g_ yoti _m_ shi), O\nPavamana, thine the sun,\' seems to conceive Soma as the bright ether, the\nazure \'sea of light\' generally; and a similar conception is perhaps implied\nwhen, in IX, 107, 20, the bard sings, \'Thine I am, O Soma, both by night and\nby day, for friendship\'s sake, O tawny one, in the bosom (of the sky 1): like\nbirds have we flown far beyond the sun scorching with heat.\'\n\nOn the other hand, it must not be forgotten that similar functions to those\nhere referred to are ascribed to other deities besides Soma, without there\nbeing any cogent reason for assuming an intentional _rapprochement_ , still\nless identification of these deities with Soma; and, in point of fact, the\nallusions in the hymns are too vague to enable us to determine the exact\nrelations between Soma and the heavenly light. Indeed, it may be questioned\nwhether there was any very clear apprehension of these relations; or whether,\nprior to the ultimate identification of Soma with the moon, we have not to\ndeal with a body of floating ideas rather than with a settled mythological\nconception of the divine Soma. During his brief term of existence on earth--\nfrom his mountain birth to his final consummation as \'the supreme offering\'\n(uttama _m_ havis)--the outward form of Soma passes through a succession of\nchanges from which the poet would draw many a feature wherewith to endow the\ndivine object of his fancy. He might thus represent Soma now as a shining tree\nspringing from the mountains of the sky; now as a luminous drop or spark\nmoving through the heavens, and shedding light all around; or as innumerable\ndrops of light scattered over the wide aerial\n\np. xvi\n\nexpanse; now as a glittering stream, or again, as a vast sea of liquid light.\n\nThe references of the Avesta to the divine Haoma are even less definite and\nexplicit than those of the Vedic hymns. His connection with the heavenly\nlight, though not perhaps so close as that of Mithra and other deities, is\nunmistakable enough 1; but we look in vain for any clear. indication as to\nwhat the exact relations are. It is certain, however, that nowhere in the\nAvesta is there any passage which could warrant us to assume an identification\nof Haoma with either the Sun or the Moon. In Ya _s_ na IX, 81-82, we are told\nthat Haoma was the first to be invested by Ahura-Mazda with the zone, spangled\nwith stars, and made in heaven, in accordance with the good Mazda-ya _s_ nic\nlaw; and that girt therewith he dwells upon the heights of the mountain to\nuphold the sacred ordinances. It is difficult to see what else the star-\nspangled zone (the heavenly counterpart of the ordinary Kusti of the orthodox\nParsi) could here refer to, except the milky way, or perhaps the starry sky\ngenerally;--unless, indeed, as is scarcely likely, some special constellation\nbe implied;--but neither this nor any other passage enables us in any way to\ndefine the divine personality of Haoma.\n\nSoma\'s descent to the earth, as pictured in the Vedic hymns, is attended with\nviolent disturbances in the regions of the sky, in which Indra generally plays\nthe principal part. It is admitted on all hands that we have to look upon\nthese supernal struggles as mythic impressions of ordinary atmospheric\nphenomena, especially those of the Indian monsoon and rainy season, and the\nviolent thunderstorms by which they are usually accompanied. According to the\nneeds and anxieties by which he was swayed at the moment, these atmospheric\noccurrences presented themselves to the poet\'s mind chiefly in two different\nlights. Either, the approaching masses of clouds brought with them the long-\ndesired rain, and the prospect of abundant food for man and beast: in that\ncase the gods were doing battle for the possession of\n\np. xvii\n\nthe celestial waters, or the heavenly cows, too long confined by malicious\ndemons in their mountain strongholds; or, after a time of tempest and gloom,\none longed to see again the bright sky and the golden sunlight, to cheer life\nand ripen the crops: in which case it was a struggle for the recovery of the\nheavenly light.\n\nThe relation in which Soma stands to Indra is mainly that of the fiery\nbeverage, the welcome draughts of which give the warrior god the requisite\nstrength and nerve for battling with the demons of drought and darkness.\nIndra\'s favourite weapon is the thousand-spiked, iron or golden thunderbolt,\nthe lightning. But inasmuch as it is Soma that enables Indra effectually to\nwield his weapon, the poet might, by a bold, yet perfectly natural, metaphor,\nidentify the potent drink with the terrible bolt. This identification is\nindeed met with in several passages of the _Ri_ k 1, notably in IX, 47, 3,\n\'When his song of praise is brought forth, then Soma, the powerful (indriya)\nliquor, becomes the thousand-fold-winning thunderbolt;\' in IX, 72, 7, \'Indra\'s\nthunderbolt, the bountiful (vibhuvasu) bull, the exhilarating Soma clarifies\nitself in a manner pleasing to the heart;\' and in IX, 77, 1, \'This sweet\n(Soma) has roared in the tub, Indra\'s thunderbolt, more beautiful than the\nbeautiful one 2.\' Not less natural is the simile implied in epithets, properly\napplying to Indra,--such as \'v _ri_ trahan\' (slayer of V _ri_ tra), and \'goda\'\n(cow-giver),--when applied to Soma, who helps him to make good those titles of\nhis; just as one can understand their being occasionally applied to Agni, the\nsacrificial fire, as the medium through which the libations reach Indra. A\nsimilar kind of poetic figure is involved in passages representing Soma as\nexercising an influence, not on Indra himself, but on the weapons wielded by\nhim 3;\n\np. xviii\n\nsuch as VIII, 76, 9, \'O Indra, drink the pressed Soma, . . . sharpening the\nthunderbolt with its strength;\' or IX, 96, 12, where Soma is called upon to\njoin Indra, and produce weapons for him ( _g_ anayayudhani); or VIII, 15, 7,\nwhere the Soma-cup (dhisha _n_ a) is said to whet Indra\'s power, his daring\nand intelligence, as well as the desirable thunderbolt.\n\nBut, while most scholars will probably be content to apply this kind of\ninterpretation to cases of an apparent identification of Soma and the Va _g_\nra such as those referred to, M. Bergaigne is evidently in favour of their\nidentity pure and simple. Now, it cannot be denied that the authors of some of\nthose passages may really have intended to represent Soma as virtually or\nactually the same as the thunderbolt; but even if that were so, we should\nhardly be justified in assuming this identity to have been anything like a\nsettled and universally accepted conception in the times of the hymns.. There\nsurely is some danger in treating a miscellaneous collection like the Rig-\nveda, as if it were a uniform and homogeneous production, and in generalizing\nfrom one or two isolated passages. In this respect I cannot help thinking that\nM. Bergaigne has often gone farther than many scholars will be prepared to\nfollow him. Thus another of his favourite theories seems to be the ultimate\nidentity of Soma and Agni. But close as the relations of these two deities\nundoubtedly are, and even admitting that they may occasionally have been the\nobject of those syncretist tendencies which we see so often at work in the\nmythological speculations of the _Ri_ shis, nevertheless I cannot but think\nthat to the generality of Vedic poets Agni and Soma were perfectly distinct\ndeities, as distinct from each other as the two visible objects which\nrepresent them on earth. Indeed, M. Bergaigne himself has to admit (I, 167)\nthat, \'as the fire and beverage were in reality distinct on earth, this\ndistinction was inevitably extended sometimes to their divine forms.\' But if\nsuch is the case, and if they are actually invoked together in one and the\nsame hymn, should one not think that even in those divine forms of theirs they\nmust at least have\n\np. xix\n\nbeen regarded as two different manifestations of the same divinity?\n\nSoma makes his descent to the earth in showers of rain, amid thunder and\nlightning. Here a new problem presents itself: in this strife of elements]\nwhat is the exact phenomenon in which we are to recognise the divine Soma as\ntemporarily embodied? It used to be taken for granted that the rain of the\nthunderstorm must be so regarded, being as it were the atmospheric counterpart\nof the earthly Soma drops, expressed from the juicy stalk and flowing into the\nvat. M. Bergaigne, however, has put forward the theory that it is not the\nrain, but the lightning, that really represents Soma; and has tried to show,\nwith no little ingenuity, that several passages of the _Ri_ k can only, or at\nany rate most naturally, be explained by the light of his theory. Now,\naccording to an old myth, frequently alluded to in the hymns, Soma was brought\ndown to the earth by an eagle or falcon ( _s_ yena). Thus we read in I, 93, 6,\n\'Matari _s_ van has brought down the one (Agni) from the sky, and the _S_ yena\nhas churned the other (Soma) from the (celestial) rock.\' A. Kuhn saw in this\nbird only another form of Indra who. in two passages (I, 32, 14; X, 99, 8), is\nindeed directly likened to a _S_ yena. On the other hand, this identification\nis rendered doubtful by two other passages (I, 80, 2; IV, 18, 13), in which\nthe _S_ yena is represented as bringing the Soma to Indra himself. Here, then,\nis a veritable crux. M. Bergaigne does not hesitate to cut the knot by\nidentifying the Soma-bearing bird with the lightning; and the lightning again\nbeing to him no other than Soma, the myth thus resolves itself into the rather\ncommonplace fact that Soma takes himself down to the earth. He only needed to\ngo a step further by identifying Soma, not only with Agni and the lightning,\nbut also with Indra himself, and the phantasmagory would have been complete.\nIndeed, one of M. Bergaigne\'s disciples, M. Koulikovski, has already come very\nnear supplying this deficiency, when he remarks (Revue de Linguistique, XVIII,\np. 3), that in the hymn IV, 26 \'we have to do with a twofold personage,\ncomposed of the attributes of Indra and Soma.\'\n\np. xx\n\nNow, if this myth were a purely Indian one, one might be content to relegate\nit to the category of Vedic \'paradoxes\' to the vindication of which M.\nBergaigne declares himself ready to devote his life. But as there can be no\nreasonable doubt that the myth goes back to Indo-European times, and that its\nobject is simply to account for the mysterious effect of spirituous liquor or\nthe \'fire-water,\' so to speak, I for one find it impossible to accept M.\nBergaigne\'s explanation of this myth, at least so far as the identification of\nSoma and the lightning is concerned 1. On the other hand, his theory\nundoubtedly receives a considerable amount of support from the fact that the\nSoma is frequently compared with the _S_ yena. But we saw that the same term\nis applied to Indra, as it also is to the Maruts (X, 92, 6), to the A _s_ vins\n(IV, 74, 9; VIII, 73, 4), and to Surya (V, 45, 9); and there is in my opinion\nno evidence to show that this comparison has any connection with the myth\nwhich makes the fiery liquor to be brought down by a _S_ yena. Moreover,\nwherever that comparison occurs, it undoubtedly applies to the Pavamana, or\nthe drops or streams of Soma flowing through the filter into the vat; and I\ncan see no reason why we should not consider the showers of rain as the exact\ncounterpart of the clarifying Soma. But, of course, the real divine Soma is\nnot the rain-drop itself, any more than he is the drop of juice expressed from\nthe Soma-plant; but he is the spark of celestial fire enclosed in the drop. It\nwould seem, then, that, as the masses of cloud overspread the sky, Soma, the\nheavenly light, is conceived as entering into union with the celestial cows or\nwaters, released by the thunderbolt from their mountain keep, and coming down\nwith them to the earth.\n\np. xxi\n\nBut while I find it impossible, as regards the myth of the Soma-bearing bird,\nto identify with M. Bergaigne the winged bearer (probably the lightning) with\nits burden, the Soma; the descent of the fiery god is pictured in various\nother ways, and it might still be possible that one or other poet had\nconceived of the bull-like Soma, as the lightning, uniting with the heavenly\ncows in their earthward course, so that before reaching the earth the rain-\ndrops would be impregnated with Soma\'s essence, and would, in fact, be of the\nsame nature as the Soma-juice. I am not prepared, therefore, entirely to\nreject the identification of Soma with the lightning; only I do not think that\nany one of the crucial passages adduced by M. Bergaigne in favour of that\nidentity necessarily requires the interpretation he proposes. Thus, in IX, 41,\n3, \'The sound of the mighty Pavamana (the clarifying Soma) is heard like that\nof the rain: the lightnings pass in the sky,\' it surely seems rather\nfarfetched to take the lightning, instead of the rain, to be the object with\nwhich Soma is compared, merely because in the same hymn Soma is also compared\nwith the sun and the heavenly river Rasa. The same may be said of IX, 108,\n\'That joy-pouring (mada- _k_ yut) thousand-streamed bull they have milked out\nfrom the sky,\' and several other passages. The verse IX, 87, 8, divo na vidyut\nstanayanty abhrai _h_ , somasya te pavata indra dhara, \'Thy stream of Soma, O\nIndra, clarifies itself, as (does) the thundering lightning of the sky by\nmeans of the clouds,\' is more favourable to\n\np. xxii\n\n[paragraph continues] M. Bergaigne\'s view, as may also be the doubtful\npassage, V, 84, 3, yat te abhrasya vidyuto divo varshanti v _ri_ sh _t_ aya\n_h_ , \'When the rains of the cloud rain thee (O earth) lightnings from the sky\n(?).\' As regards VII, 69, 6, addressed to the A _s_ vins, \'Come, ye two men,\nto our libations this day, like two thirsty bulls to the lightning,\' M.\nBergaigne (I, 168) thinks that the identification of Soma with the lightning\ncan alone explain this passage; since it would be impossible to imagine that\nthe two bulls could anticipate the falling of rain from the appearance of the\nlightning. Though a poetic figure like this hardly bears such critical\nhandling, perhaps M. Bergaigne will allow me to ask whether, if the passage\nhad read, \'Come ye hither to our libations, like two bulls to the thunder 1,\'\nhe would have thought it so very bold a figure for a Vedic poet to use?\n\nThe most important of all passages, however, undoubtedly is IX, 84, 3: a yo\ngobhi _h_ s _ri_ _g_ yata oshadhishu . . . . a vidyuta pavate dharaya suta _h_\n, indra _m_ somo madayan daivya _m_ _g_ anam. M. Bergaigne translates (I, 172)\nthe first pada by \'Lui qui est repandu avec les vaches (i.e. the raindrops)\ndans les plantes,\' which, of course, fits either view equally well; the only\nquestion being, whether Soma is already united with the rain-drops when they\nare poured forth by the clouds, or whether, in the shape of lightning, he is\nstill separate from them. The third pada, M. Bergaigne remarks (I, 170), may\nbe boldly (hardiment) translated by \'Il se clarifie, exprime en un torrent qui\nest l\'eclair.\' This rendering, if correct, would doubtless settle the point;\nbut to my mind it is not only a very doubtful, but a highly improbable\nexplanation. What I believe to be the true interpretation of the passage had\nbeen given by Prof. Ludwig two years before the publication of M. Bergaigne\'s\nvolume, viz. \'Expressed in a stream, he clarifies himself by the lightning--\nSoma who exhilarates (or inebriates) Indra and the divine race.\' It will be\nseen that this alters the case completely. The lightning would be\n\np. xxiii\n\ncompared with the filter of white sheep\'s wool, through which the Soma-juice\npercolates into the vat. The same simile, in my opinion, is implied wherever\nthe formula pavate (a) v _ri_ sh _t_ im, \'he clarifies himself into rain,\' is\nused (IX, 49, I; 3; 65, 3; 24; 96, 14; 108, 10). And, in truth, the simile\nseems to me a very striking one; but we must not, of course, think of single\nflashes of lightning such as we are accustomed to in our northern climes (and\nas are doubtless implied in the Vedic conception of the Va _g_ ra or\nthunderbolt), but of that continuous and widespread electric illumination (vi-\ndyut) which forms a characteristic feature of the monsoon, when the showers of\nrain seem to flow through an immense space of light 1.\n\np. xxiv\n\nThe striking coincidences between the Vedic Agnish _t_ oma and the Homa\nceremony of the Parsis, pointed out by Martin Haug (Ait. Br. I, p. 59 seq.),\nleave no doubt as to the complete development of the Soma-ritual in its\nessential features before the separation of the Indo-Iranians. The exact\nidentity of the plant from which their sacred liquor was prepared is still\nsomewhat doubtful. An official inquiry which has been set on foot in\nconsequence of two papers published by Prof. Roth (Journal of Germ. Or. Soc.\n1881 and 1883), and translated by Mr. C. J. Lyall, secretary to the Chief\nCommissioner of Assam, and which, it is understood, is now carried on, on the\npart of the Government of India, by Dr, Aitchison, botanist to the Afghan\nBoundary Commission, will probably ere long settle the matter once for all.\nThe appearance of the first official blue-book on the subject has already led\nto a renewed discussion of the matter, in. the columns of a weekly journal 1,\nin which Profs. Max Muller and R. v. Roth, as well as several distinguished\nbotanists, especially Drs. J. G. Baker and W. T. Thiselton Dyer, have taken\npart. Of especial interest in this discussion is a letter 2, by Mr. A.\nHouttum-Schindler, dated Teheran, December 20, 1884, in which an account is\ngiven of the plant from which the present Parsis of Kerman and Yezd obtain\ntheir Hum juice, and which they assert to be the very same\n\np. xxv\n\nas the Haoma of the Avesta. The Hum shrub, according to this description,\ngrows to the height of four feet, and consists of circular fleshy stalks (the\nthickest being about a finger thick) of whitish colour, with light brown\nstreaks. The juice was milky, of a greenish white colour, and had a sweetish\ntaste. Mr. Schindler was, however, told that, after being kept for a few days,\nit turned sour and, like the stalks, became yellowish brown. The stalks break\neasily at the joints, and then form small cylindrical pieces. They had lost\ntheir leaves, which are said to be small and formed like those of the\njessamine. This description, according to the above naturalists, would seem to\nagree tolerably well with the _Sarcostemma_ (akin to the common milk-weed), or\nsome other group of _Asclepiads_ , such as the _Periploca aphylla_ which, as\nMr. Baker states, has been traced by Dr. Haussknecht to 3000 feet in the\nmountains of Persia, and, according to Dr. Aitchison, is common also in\nAfghanistan. A quotation from a medical Sanskrit work, to which attention was\ndrawn by Prof. Max Muller many years ago, states that, \'the creeper, called\nSoma, is dark, sour, without leaves, milky, fleshy on the surface; it destroys\n(or causes) phlegm, produces vomiting, and is eaten by goats.\' The foul, sour\nsmell of the Sonia-juice is also alluded to in our Brahma _n_ a (see the\npresent volume, [p. 266](sbe2642.htm#page_266)). According to Prof. Spiegel 1,\nthe Parsis of Bombay obtain their Homa from Kerman, whither they send their\npriests from time to time to get it. The plant at present used by the Hindu\npriests of the Dekhan, on the other hand, according to Haug, is not the Soma\nof the Vedas, but appears to belong to the same order. \'It grows (he informs\nus, Ait. Br. II, 489) on hills in the neighbourhood of Poona to the height of\nabout four to five feet, and forms a kind of bush, consisting of a certain\nnumber of shoots, all coming from the same root; their stem is solid like\nwood; the bark grayish; they are without leaves; the sap appears whitish, has\na very stringent taste, is bitter, but not sour: it is a very nasty drink, and\nhas some intoxicating effect. I tasted it several times, but\n\np. xxvi\n\nit was impossible for me to drink more than some teaspoonfuls.\' In fact,\nseveral varieties of Sarcostemma or Asclepiads 1, somewhat different from\nthose of Persia and Afghanistan, which are not to be found so far south, seem\nto have been, and indeed seem still to be, made use of for the Soma-sacrifice.\nAnd notwithstanding the objections raised by Dr. G. Watt, in his useful\n\'Notes,\' appended to the translation of Professor Roth\'s papers, every\nprobability seems to me to be in favour of the identity of the original Soma-\nplant with the shrub, the stalks of which are used by the Parsis in preparing\ntheir Hum juice, or with some other plant of the same genus. It certainly\nwould seem to have been a plant with soft, succulent stems. Dr. Watt remarks,\n\'We know of no instance of a succulent plant retaining, for weeks or months,\nits sap within isolated twigs, and, indeed, we can recall but few plants which\ncould withstand, even for a day or two, the dry climate of India, so as to\nretain the sap within their isolated and cut twigs.\' But, though at the time\nof the Vedic hymns fresh and juicy plants were probably used for the\npreparation of the sacred drink, in later times, when the plants had to be\nconveyed some considerable distance into India, the withered and shrunk plants\nwere apparently found, with the admixture of water and other ingredients, to\nserve the same purpose. For we know from the description given in the Sutras,\nthat water was poured on the plants previously to their being beaten with the\npressing-stones. This moistening or steeping is called apyayanam, or \'the\nmaking (the plants) swell.\' After being then well beaten and bruised, they\nwere thrown into the vat, or rather trough, partly filled with water, and were\npressed out with the hand. Dr. Watt thinks Professor Roth ought rather to have\npublished briefly the leading passages in the hymns descriptive of the plant,\nfrom which naturalists might have drawn their own conclusions. One might as\nwell ask a Hebrew\n\np. xxvii\n\nscholar to give accurate descriptions of the \'lily of the valley\' to enable\nthe botanist to identify and classify the lovely flower which delighted the\nheart of king Solomon. It is exactly the want of an accurate knowledge of the\nnature of the Soma-plant which prevents the Vedic scholar from being able to\nunderstand some of the few material allusions to it. Thus the term a _m_ _s_\nu, commonly applied to the Soma-plant, used to be taken to mean simply \'plant\'\nor \'sprig, shoot;\' but Professor Roth seems now inclined, perhaps rightly, to\ntake it as referring to the internode, or cylindrical piece between two joints\nof the stem. The substitutes approved of by the _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a, in\ncase no genuine Soma-plants can be obtained, will be found enumerated at pp.\n[421](sbe2668.htm#page_421)-[422](sbe2669.htm#page_422) of the present volume.\nA description of these plants, so far as they have been identified, is given\nin Professor Roth\'s paper.\n\nI cannot conclude these remarks without expressing my hearty thanks to those\nscholars who have done me the honour of reviewing the first volume of this\nwork. To Professor Whitney I feel especially indebted for his most careful\nexamination of my translation, and the searching, yet appreciative, criticism\nhe has been good enough to apply to it. I shall feel content, if the present\nvolume finds at least one reader as conscientious and painstaking. While I\nagree with most of Prof. Whitney\'s suggestions 1, there are one or two points\nraised by him, and these perhaps of the more important, on which I have been\nunable to take his view; and as some of these points involve renderings\nadhered to in the present volume, I take the opportunity here briefly to\nadvert to them.\n\nThe most important of these points probably is my rendering of the term kapala\nby \'potsherd,\' instead of \'cup, dish,\' as proposed by Prof. Whitney. Instead\nof speaking of a sacrificial cake on eleven or twelve potsherds, we are to\ncall it a cake on so many cups or dishes. The term\n\np. xxviii\n\n[paragraph continues] \'potsherd\' no doubt is somewhat awkward, and, had it\nbeen possible, I should have preferred to use the simple obsolete word \'shard\'\nor \'sherd\' for it; but I decidedly object to either \'cup\' or \'dish.\' I gather\nfrom his suggestion, that we take entirely different views of the purpose and\nnature of the kapala. I have to reject the proposed renderings for the very\nreason for which they commend themselves to Prof. Whitney, namely, because\nthey imply so many vessels complete in themselves. He asks, whether I suppose\n\'that the Brahmans made their offerings on fragments of broken pottery?\' Well,\nI certainly believe that the kapalas are meant to represent the fragments of a\nbroken dish. The sacrificial cake is to be baked on a dish, but for symbolic\nreasons this dish is supposed to be Broken up into a number of pieces or\nkapalas. The symbolic significance of this seems to be a twofold one. On the\none hand, the dish is to resemble the human skull. Hence we read _S_ at. Br.\nI, 2, I, 2, \'The cake is the head of Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a (the sacrifice, and\nsymbolically the sacrificer himself);, for those potsherds (kapalani) are what\nthe skull-bones ( _s_ irsh _n_ a _h_ kapalani) are, and the ground rice is\nnothing else than the brain.\' On the other hand, the kapalas are usually\narranged (see Part I, p. 34, note) in such a manner as to produce a fancied\nresemblance to the (upper 1) shell of the tortoise, which is a symbol of the\nsky, as the tortoise itself represents the universe. Thus with cakes on a\nsingle kapala, the latter is indeed a complete dish. In the same way the term\nkapala, in the singular, is occasionally applied to the skull, as well as to\nthe upper and the lower case of the tortoise, e. g. _S_ at. Br. VII, 5, I, 2:\n\'That lower kapala of it (the tortoise) is this world, for that (kapala) is\nfirmly established, and firmly established is this world; and that upper\n(kapala) is yonder sky, for It has its ends turned down, and so has that sky\nits ends turned down; and that which is between is that atmosphere: verily\nthat same (tortoise) represents these worlds.\' More usually, however, the term\nis applied to the single\n\np. xxix\n\nbones of the skull (and the plates of the tortoise-case). Hence the Medini\nsays (lanta 71), kapalo \'stri _s_ iro-\'sthni syad, gha _t_ ade _h_ _s_ akale,\nvra _g_ e,--kapala may be used in the sense of \'head-bone,\' in that of\n\'fragment of a pot,\' &c., and in the sense of \'collection.\'\n\nProfessor Whitney takes exception to my occasionally translating atman by\n\'body,\'--an inaccuracy, he remarks, that might easily be avoided. I do not\nquite understand on what grounds he objects to this rendering. The original\nmeaning of atman doubtless is (breath) \'self, soul;\' but surely there can be\nno question that it also commonly means \'body, trunk,\' in contradistinction to\nthe limbs, wings, &c. Thus we read _S_ at. Br. [IV, 1, 2,\n25](sbe2641.htm#4:1:2:25), \'The sacrifice is fashioned like a bird: the Upa\n_m_ _s_ u and Antaryama are its wings, and the Upa _m_ _s_ usavana is its body\n1.\'\n\nMy rendering of \'videgho ha mathava _h_ \' (I, 4, I, 10) by \'Mathava the (king\nof) Videgha,\' instead of \'Videgha (the) Mathava,\' is rightly objected to.\nIndeed, I had already taken occasion, in the introduction to the same volume\n(I, p. xli, note 4), to make that correction.\n\nProf. Whitney\'s remarks on \'yupena yopayitva\' are adverted to at [p.\n36](sbe2608.htm#page_36), note [1](sbe2608.htm#fn_100) of the present volume;\nas are also those on \'ed\' at [p. 265](sbe2641.htm#page_265), note\n[2](sbe2642.htm#fn_636). In regard to the latter point he rather does me wrong\nby supposing that I apparently regarded the particle (or particles) \'ed\' (for\nwhich the Ka _n_ va text seems to read \'a hi\') as a verb-form from the root\n\'i,\' to go. The fact is that I followed Prof. Weber (Ind. Stud. IX, p. 249) in\ntaking it to be a popular expression, with a verb of motion understood,\nsomewhat in the sense of the German \'hin;\' e. g. \'Shall we go there?\'--\'Hin\ndenn!\' i.e. \'Let us go then.\'\n\nMy translation of II, 4, 2, 19 is not quite approved of by\n\np. xxx\n\n[paragraph continues] Prof. Whitney. There offering is made severally to the\nsacrificer\'s grandfather and great-grandfather with the formula \'N.N., this\nfor thee!\' to which some authorities add \'and for those who come after thee.\'\nThis addition is rejected by the author on the ground that \'svayam vai tesha\n_m_ saha yesha _m_ saha,\' which I translated by \'since he himself is one of\nthose to whom [it would be offered] in common.\' Prof. Whitney takes exception\nto this, remarking that in that case, the phrase \'and those who (come) after\nthee\' might be added, without any reason to the contrary. But he forgets one\nimportant point, namely, that it would be a fatal thing for the sacrificer in\nthis way to associate himself with the departed ancestors, and even make\noffering to himself along with them: it would simply mean that \'he would\nstraightway go to yonder world,\' that he would not live his fulness of days.\nThe clause under discussion is elliptic, its literal translation being\n\'Himself surely (is) of those withal of whom (he is) withal.\' This may either\nbe taken in the sense in which I took it (see also St. Petersb. Dict. s. v.\nsaha); or in a general way, \'He surely is one of those with whom he associates\nhimself;\' i.e. he would himself be a dead man.\n\nIn the legend of Manu and the Flood (I, 8, 1, 1 seq.) I find it impossible to\naccept Prof. Delbruck\'s conjecture, which Prof. Whitney thinks the best and\nonly acceptable one, viz. that (in par. 4) the sentence \' _s_ a _s_ vad ha\n_gh_ asha asa, sa hi _g_ yesh _th_ am vardhate\' is an interpolated gloss. My\nreason for not accepting it is the fact that the passage occurs likewise in\nthe Ka _n_ va recension, and is thus authenticated for so comparatively early\na period that the difficulty of accounting for the interpolation might be even\ngreater than that of the interpretation of the passage itself. Professor\nLudwig, in his kindly notice in \'Gottinger Gel. Anz.\' 1883, proposes to take\n_s_ a _s_ vat in the sense of \xcf\x80\xce\xac\xce\xbd\xcf\x84\xcf\x89\xcf\x82: \'It quite so (i.e. in accordance with\nthe prediction) became a large fish.\' Prof. Max Muller has again translated\nthis legend in his \'India, what can it teach us?\' p. 134 seq., where he\nrenders this passage by \'He became soon a large fish\n\np. xxxi\n\n[paragraph continues] ( _gh_ asha), for such a fish grows largest.\' I am still\ninclined to take _gh_ asha as the name of some kind of fish, real or mythic.\n\nProfessor Whitney once more discusses the vexed question as to the real\nmeaning of \' _G_ atavedas,\' and thinks the translation \'Wesen-kenner,\' \'being-\nknower,\' or \'he who knoweth [all] beings\' to be unacceptable. He remarks that\n\'The word may, indeed, fairly be regarded as an obscure one: that is to say,\nit is very strange that an appellation so frequently applied to Agni should\nnot have its meanings distinctly pointed out, either by its applicableness, or\nby parallel expressions used in the descriptions of the same god or in\nascriptions made to him; but no such explanation has been found obtainable\nfrom the Vedic writings.\' It is no doubt a fact that at the time of Yaska--who\n(7, 19) proposes five different derivations of the term, the first of which is\nthe one given above, viz. _g_ atani veda, \'he knows (the things) that are\nborn\'--the real meaning of the compound was unknown; and even at the time of\nthe hymns the epithet seems to have been understood in different ways. That\nthe meaning \'knower of beings\' was, at any rate, one of those commonly\nassigned to _G_ atavedas\' by the Vedic poets, seems to me, however,\nsufficiently manifest from a number of parallel expressions used in reference\nto Agni, such as Rig-veda VI, 15, 13, vi _s_ va veda _g_ anima _g_ ataveda _h_\n1, \' _G_ atavedas knows all races (or existences);\' I, 70, 1, a daivyani vrata\n_k_ ikitvan a manushyasya _g_ anasya _g_ anma, \'he who minds the divine\nordinances, and the race of the human kind;\' ib. 3, devanam _g_ anma marta _m_\n_s_ _k_ a vidvan, \'knowing the race of gods and the men;\' I, 189, 1, vi _s_\nvani vayunani vidvan, \'knowing all works;\' ib. 7, tvam tan agna ubhayan v\nvidvan veshi, &c. On the other hand, in _S_ at. Br. IX, 5, I, 68, the term is\nexplained by _g_ ata _m_ _g_ ata _m_ vindate; he takes possession of being\nafter being, or of whatsoever is born. How easily terns such as _G_ atavedas\nand Wesenkenner\n\np. xxxii\n\n[paragraph continues] (knower of beings) may assume different meanings, may be\nseen from Mr. Peile\'s remark (Notes on the Nalopakhyanam, p. 23), \' _G_\natavedas, the Vedic epithet of Agni, is described as the "knower of the\nessence" ( _g_ ata), Grassmann, Dict. s. v.\'\n\nFor the first chapter of the third book, treating of the ceremony of\nconsecration, I have had the advantage of availing myself of the German\ntranslation, published by Dr. B. Lindner in his pamphlet, \'Die Diksha,\'\nLeipzig, 1878.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xiii:1](sbe2602.htm#fr_0) Or, as the vessel containing the divine Soma, the\ndrink conferring immortality.\n\n[xiii:2](sbe2602.htm#fr_1) See, for instance, _S_ at.

A. Bergaigne, II, 251.\n\n[xx:1](sbe2602.htm#fr_12) For the same reason I find it impossible to accept\nM. Bergaigne\'s interpretation of the hymn IV, 27, put forward at the end of\nhis work (vol. iii, p. 322 seq.). According to that interpretation, Soma, in\nthe first verse, declares that he himself flew forth from his prison as an\neagle; and then, in the second verse--as it were reproving those who might\nimagine the eagle to be a different being from himself--he adds, \'It was not\nhe (the eagle) that bore me away with ease, but I triumphed by my own\ncleverness and bravery!\' I am afraid this critical specimen of the feathered\ntribe will not find many admirers among p. xxi prosaic Sanskritists. I should\nprefer, with Prof. Roth, to read \'nir adiyat\' instead of \'nir adiyam,\' unless\nit were possible to read \' _s_ yena _g_ avasa\' instead of \' _s_ yeno _g_\navasa.\' M. Koulikovski, in the paper referred to, throws the hymns IV, 26 and\n27 together, and takes them as a sort of mytho-critical controversy between\nthe god Soma and some other person (perhaps the author himself), advocating\ntwo different versions of the Soma-myth, viz. Soma contending that it was\nhimself who brought the divine plant, while his interlocutor (\'who has the\nlast word in the hymn\') maintains that it was brought by a falcon. Thus,\naccording to this scholar, the falcon was already (!) distinguished from Soma;\nand these two hymns \'are, as it were, an echo of a religious, or rather\nmythological dispute, which had divided the theologians of the Vedic epoch.\'\nPerhaps Prof. Oldenberg\'s theory of \xc3\x82khyata-hymns, or detached pieces of\npoetry connected by prose narratives, might have a chance with these hymns.\n\n[xxii:1](sbe2602.htm#fr_13) Cp.

H. Caunter\'s\nOriental Annual (1834):--\'There was a slight haze upon the distant waters\nwhich seemed gradually to thicken, although not to a density sufficient to\nrefract the rays of the sun, which still flooded the broad sea with one\nunvarying mass of glowing light . . . . Towards the afternoon, the aspect of\nthe sky began to change; the horizon gathered blackness, and the sun, which\nhad risen so brightly, had evidently culminated in darkness, and to have his\nsplendour veiled from human sight by a long, gloomy period of storm and\nturbulence. Masses of heavy clouds appeared to rise from the sea, black and\nportentous, accompanied by sudden gusts of wind, that suddenly died away,\nbeing succeeded by an intense, death-like stillness, as if the air were in a\nstate of utter stagnation, and its vital properties arrested. It seemed no\nlonger to circulate, until again agitated by the brief but mighty gusts which\nswept fiercely along, like the giant heralds of the sky. Meanwhile the lower\ncircle of the heavens looked a deep brassy red, from the partial reflection of\nthe sunbeams upon the thick clouds, which had now everywhere overspread it . .\n. From the house which we occupied we could behold the setting in of the\nmonsoon in all its grand and terrific sublimity. The wind, with a force which\nnothing could resist, bent the tufted heads of the tall, slim cocoa-nut trees\nalmost to the earth, flinging the light sand into the air in eddying vortices,\nuntil the rain had either so increased its gravity, or beaten it into a mass,\nas to prevent the wind from raising it. The pale lightning streamed from the\nclouds in broad sheets of flame, which appeared to encircle the heavens as if\nevery element had been converted into fire, and the world was on the eve of a\ngeneral conflagration, whilst the peal, which instantly followed, was like the\nexplosion of a gunpowder-magazine, or the discharge of artillery in the gorge\nof a mountain, where the repercussion of surrounding hills multiplies with\nterrific energy its deep and astounding echoes. The heavens seemed to be p.\nxxiv one vast reservoir of flame, which was propelled from its voluminous bed\nby some invisible but omnipotent agency, and threatened to fling its fiery\nruin upon everything around. In some parts, however, of the pitchy vapour by\nwhich the skies were by this time completely overspread, the lightning was\nseen only occasionally to glimmer in faint streaks of light, as if struggling,\nbut unable, to escape from its prison, igniting, but too weak to burst, the\nimpervious bosoms of those capacious magazines in which it was at once\nengendered and pent up. So heavy and continuous was the rain, that scarcely\nanything, save those vivid bursts of light which nothing could arrest or\nresist, was perceptible through it . . . . Day after day the same scene was\nrepeated with somewhat less violence, though at intervals the might of the\nhurricane was truly appalling . . . . The breaking up of the monsoon is\nfrequently even more violent, if possible, than its setting in, and this\nhappened to be the case during the first season after my arrival in India. It\nwas truly stupendous, and I shall never cease to remember it to the latest\nmoment of my existence.\'\n\n[xxiv:1](sbe2602.htm#fr_15) The Academy, Oct. 25, 1884--Feb. 14, 1885.\n\n[xxiv:2](sbe2602.htm#fr_16) Ibid., Jan. 31, 1885.\n\n[xxv:1](sbe2602.htm#fr_17) Eranische Alterthumskunde, III, p. 572.\n\n[xxvi:1](sbe2602.htm#fr_18) Especially _Sarcostemma intermedium_ , _S.\nbrevistigma_ , and _S. viminale_ (or Asclepias acida).
