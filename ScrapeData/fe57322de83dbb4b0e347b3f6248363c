Not any other, on account of non-permanency of abode, and of\nimpossibility.\n\nAs the reflected Self and the other Selfs mentioned by the Purvapakshin do not\nnecessarily abide within the eye, and as conditionless immortality and the\nother qualities (ascribed in the text to the Person within the eye) cannot\npossibly belong to them, the Person within the eye cannot be any Self other\nthan the highest Self. Of the reflected Self it cannot be said that it\npermanently abides within the eye, for its presence there depends on the\nnearness to the eye of another person. The embodied Self again has its seat\nwithin the heart, which is the root of all sense-organs, so as to assist\nthereby the activities of the different senses; it cannot therefore abide\nwithin the eye. And with regard to the divinity the text says that 'he rests\nwith his rays in him, i.e. the eye': this implies that the divine being may\npreside over the organ of sight although itself abiding in another place; it\ndoes not therefore abide in the eye. Moreover, non-conditioned immortality and\nsimilar qualities cannot belong to any of these three Selfs. The Person seen\nwithin the eye therefore is the highest Self.\n\nWe have, under Su. I, 2, 14, assumed as proved that the abiding within the eye\nand ruling the eye, which is referred to in B _ri_. Up. III, 7, 18 ('He who\ndwells in the eye,' &c.), can belong to the highest Self only, and have on\nthat basis proved that the Self within the eye is the highest Self.--Here\nterminates the adhikara _n_ a of that 'within.'--The next Sutra now proceeds\nto prove that assumption.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 19.
