Why are\nyou becoming so much astonished? Before this, since times immemorial (without\nany beginning) there had been many dissolutions (Pralayas); and many Sri _st_\nis (creations); and at the beginning of every creation You came first into\nexistence and every time I was united with You; but now You have forgotten me\nunder the spell of that Maha S'akti.\n\n\n\nThat Highest Maha S'akti is transcendent of all the Gu _n_ as; but you and I\nare with Gu _n_ as. Know me as the S\xc2\x92akti, all of Sattva Gu _n_ a who is\nwidely known as Maha Lak _s_ mi. After this the Prajapati Brahma, full of Rajo\nGu _n_ as, the creator of all the Lokas, will come into existence from your\nnavel lotus and will create the three worlds. Then he will perform severe\ntapasya and acquire the excellent power to create, and will create the three\nworlds by his Rajo Gu _n_ a. That highly intelligent Prajapati will create\nfirst, the five Maha bhutas (great elements), all endowed with Gu _n_ as and\nthen create mind with sensory organs and the presiding deities of the senses,\nand thus with all the ingredients, fit for creation, will create all the\nworlds. Therefore He is denominated by all as the Creator of Brahma _nd_ a. O\nhighly fortunate one! You will be the Preserver of this Universe. When the\nPrajapati Brahma will be angry at the beginning of the creation on his four\nmind-born sons, Rudra Deva will appear.\n\n\n\np. 57\n\n\n\nHe will appear then from the centre of his eye brows. On being born this Rudra\nDeva will practise very severe tapasya and will get the Samhara S\xc2\x92akti, who is\nall of Tamo Gu _n_ a and at the end of the Kalpa will destroy all this\nuniverse of five elements. O highly intelligent one! So I have come to you for\nthis work of creation, etc. So take me to you as your Vai _sn_ avi S\xc2\x92akti full\nof Sattva Gu _n_ a. O Madhusudana! I will take refuge at your breast and will\nremain always with you. Hearing all this, Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u spoke :-- \xc2\x93O\nbeautiful Devi! The half stanza was ere long heard by me, in clear words; by\nwhom was that spoken? Kindly speak to me on this great auspicious secret\nfirst. For a great doubt has come and possessed my mind. What more shall I say\nthan this that as a poor man always thinks of wealth, so I am thinking of that\nagain and again.\xc2\x94 Hearing these words of Vi _sn_ u, the Devi Maha Lak _s_ mi\nsmilingly said, with great affection :-- \xc2\x93O Strong and Energetic one! I am now\nspeaking in detail on this; listen. O Four-armed one! It is because I have\ncome to you with form and endowed with Gu _n_ as that you have come to know\nme; but you have not known that \xc3\x82dya S\xc2\x92akti, the Prime force, transcending all\nthe Gu _n_ as, though She is the substratum of all the Gu _n_ as. O highly\nfortunate one! That Devi Bhagavati, transcendant of all the Gu _n_ as, uttered\nthat all auspicious, highly sanctifying semistanza, the essence of all the\nVedas. O destroyer of the enemies! I think that there is the highest grace of\nthat Highest S\xc2\x92akti on you, that She spoke the greatest secret to you for your\nbenefit. O one performing good vows! know those words uttered by Mahavidya, as\nthe essence of all the S\xc2\x92astra. So firmly retain them within your heart; never\nforget them. There is no other thing, save that, worth being known in earnest.\nBecause you are most beloved by the Devi! that She has spoken this to you.\xc2\x94\nHearing the words of the Devi Maha Lak _s_ mi, the four-armed Bhagavan took\nthat semi stanza as a Mantra to be repeated in right earnest within his mind\nand cherished that for ever within his heart. After some time, Brahma born of\nthe lotus of the navel of Vi _sn_ u, became afraid of the two Daityas Madhu\nand Kai _t_ abha, took refuge of Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u; Vi _sn_ u killed the two\ndemons and began to do distinctly the japam of the semi-stanza. Brahma, born\nof the lotus, then asked Vi _sn_ u with a gladdened heart :-- \xc2\x93O Lord of the\nDevas! what japam are you doing? Lotus eyed! Is there any other body more\npowerful than you? O Lord of the Universe! whom do you think and thus feel\nyourself so happy?\xc2\x94 Hearing Brahma, Bhagavan Hari said :-- \xc2\x93O highly fortunate\none! Think out yourself once of the Primordial Force, the auspicious Bhagavati\n\xc3\x82dya S\xc2\x92akti who is reigning everywhere as the cause and effect and you will be\nable to understand everything. My presiding Deity is that immeasurable eternal\nMaha S\xc2\x92akti\n\n\n\np. 58\n\n\n\nBrahmamyi; on whose S\xc2\x92akti, as a receptacle with form on this ocean rests the\nwhole Universe; I am thinking of that, by which is created (often and often)\nthis entire Universe, moving and non-moving. When the Devi Bhagavati, the\ngiver of boons, become graciously pleased, the human beings become freed of\nthis bondage of Samsara; and again that highest Eternal Wisdom, the cause of\nMukti, becomes the source of bondage to this world, of those who are deluded\nby Her.\n\n\n\nShe is the \xc3\x8es'vari of the \xc3\x8es'varas of this universe. O Brahma! You, I and all\nother things of the entire Universe are born of the Chit S\xc2\x92akti (the power of\nconsciousness) of Her and Her alone; there is no manner of doubt in this. The\nsemi-stanza by which She has sown within me the seed of Bhagavata will get\nexpanded by the beginning of the Dvapara Yuga. While Bhagavan Brahma was\nresting on the navel lotus of Vi _sn_ u, He got the seed of Bhagavata. Then He\ngave it to His own son Narada, the best of the Munis. Narada gave it to me and\nI have expanded that into twelve Skandhas. Therefore, O Mahabhaga! You now\nstudy this Bhagavata Pura _n_ a, equal to the Vedas and endowed with five\ncharacteristics. In this the wonderful glorious deeds and life of the Devi\nBhagavati, the hidden meanings of the Vedas and the wisdom, the truth are all\ndescribed; hence this is the best of all the Pura _n_ as and sanctifying like\nthe Dharma S\xc2\x92astra. It is the substratum of Brahma Vidya; therefore if men\nstudy this, they will easily cross this sea of world; and those that are\nstupid and deluded get pleasure in hearing the death of Vritrasura and many\nother narrations that are interspersed\n\nin this book. Therefore, O Mahabhaga! hear this sanctifying Bhagavata Puranam\nand retain it firmly within your heart. O best of persons! You are the\nforemost of those that are intelligent; so you are worthy to read this Pura\n_n_ a. Eighteen thousand S'lokas are in that Pura _n_ a and you better get\nthem by heart; for if anybody reads or bears this Pura _n_ a, fit to be\npraised in every way, all-auspicious, capable to increase posterity by the\naddition of sons and grandsons, giving long life, happiness and peace, he sees\nthe Sun of Wisdom, resting in his breast and dispelling all darkness of\nignorance. Thus speaking to his son S\xc2\x92uka Deva, Kri _sn_ a Dvaipayan, my Guru,\nstudied us the Pura _n_ a and thought it was voluminous. I got the whole of it\nby heart. S'uka studied the Pura _n_ a and stayed in Vyasa's \xc3\x82s'rama. But he\nwas naturally dispassionate like Sanat Kumara, etc., the mind-born sons of\nBrahma; therefore he could not get peace in studying the contents of the Pura\n_n_ a which deal with Karma-Kan _d_ a (actions) fit for the house-holders. He\nremained in a solitary place, his heart being troubled very\n\n\n\np. 59\n\n\n\nmuch. He appeared, as if, with his heart void. He did not mind much for his\nfood and he did not fast also. Once Vyasa Deva seeing his son S'ukdeva so\nthoughtful, said :-- \xc2\x93O Son! What do you think constantly? And why are you\ntroubling yourself so much? Like an impoverished man, entangled in debt, you\nare always disturbed by your thoughts. O child! When I your father is living,\nwhat for do you care? Leave aside your inmost sorrows and be happy. Cast off\nall other thoughts and think of the wisdom contained in the S\xc2\x92astras and try\nyour best to acquire Vij\xc3\xb1ana, the essence of wisdom. O Suvrata! If you do not\nget peace by my words then go, at my word to Mithila, the city of the King\nJanaka. O Mahabhaga! That king Janaka, who is liberated while living, whose\nsoul is religious and who is the ocean of truth will cut asunder the net of\nyour delusion. O Son! Go to the king and question him on Varnas'ram Dharma\n(Dharma relating to caste and stages of life) and remove your doubts.\n\n\n\nThat royal sage Janaka, the greatest Yogi, the knower of Brahma and liberated\nwhile living, is of pure soul, truthspeaking, of a calm and quiet heart and\nalways fond of Yoga.\xc2\x94 Hearing these words of Vyasa Deva, the highly spirited\nS\xc2\x92uka deva of unrivalled energy replied :-- \xc2\x93O virtuous one! Your word can\nnever turn out false; but when I hear that the king Janaka is gladly governing\nhis kingdom still he is liberated while living, and disembodied while he has\nbody -- this your word appears to me quite contradictory like light and\ndarkness at one and the same place and time, and seems that these two epithets\nsimply indicate vanity and nothing else. O Father! This is my greatest doubt\nhow can the royal sage Janaka govern his kingdom, being disembodied. It\nappears that your word about Janaka is quite false as the son of a barren\nwoman. O Father! I have now got a desire to see the disembodied king Janaka;\nfor my mind is plunged in great doubt how can he remain in samsara unattached\nlike a lotus leaf in water? O Greatest Orator! Is the liberation of Janaka\naccording to Buddhistic doctrines or like the opinions of the materialistic\nCharvakas! O highly intelligent one! How can the royal sage Janaka, in spite\nof his being a householder, quit the usages of his senses? I cannot comprehend\nthis. How can the things enjoyed by him appear to him, as if, unenjoyed and\nand how can his doings be his non-doings? How can the ideas of mother, wife,\nson, sister, prostitutes and various persons having different relations,\narising within him vanish again altogether? And if that be not the case, how\ncan his Jivanmuktahood be possible? If his taste be present of pungent, sour,\nastringent, bitter, and sweet things, then it is clear that he is enjoying all\nthe most excellent things, O Father! This is my greatest\n\n\n\np. 60\n\n\n\nwonder and doubt, that if he has got the sense of heat and cold, pleasure and\npain, how can he be a Jivanmukta? That king is thoroughly expert in reigning\nhis kingdom; how then the ideas of enemy, friend, taste and distaste,\nremaining absent in him, he can govern his state? How can he look with the\nsame eyes a thief and an ascetic? And if he makes any distinction, how then is\nhis liberation effected? I have never seen such a man, that is liberated while\nliving and at the same time an expert king in governing his subjects. For\nthese reasons, great doubt has arisen in me. I cannot understand how can the\nking Janaka be liberated, while he is remaining in his house? Whatever it be,\nI desire now greatly to see him after his Jivanmuktahood; so I desire to go to\nMithila to solve my doubts.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nThus ends the Sixteenth Chapter of the first Skandha on S\xc2\x92uka's desiring to go\nto Mithila to see Janaka, in the Mahapura _n_ a S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam of\n18,000 verses.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 17](bk01ch17.htm)\n\n"
