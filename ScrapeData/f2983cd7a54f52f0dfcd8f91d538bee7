A. Charm for curing scrofulous sores called apakit.\n\n1\\. Ye (sores) fall easily from that which falls easily, ye exist less than\nthose that do not exist (at all); ye are drier than the (part of the body\ncalled) sehu, more moist than salt.  \n2\\. The apakit (sores) that are upon the neck, and those that are upon the\nshoulders; the apakit that are upon the vigaman (some part of the body) fall\noff of themselves.\n\n### B. Charm for curing tumours called gayanya.\n\n3\\. The gayanya that crushes the ribs, that which passes down to the sole of\nthe foot, and whichever is fixed upon the crown of the head, I have driven out\nevery one.  \n4\\. The gayanya, winged, flies; he settles down upon man. Here is the remedy\nboth for sores not caused by cutting as well as for wounds sharply cut!  \n5\\. We know, O gayanya, thy origin, whence thou didst spring. How canst thou\nslay there, in whose house we offer oblations?\n\n### C. Stanza sung at the mid-day pressure of the soma.\n\n6\\. Drink stoutly, O Indra, slayer of Vritra, hero, of the soma in the cup, at\nthe battle for riches! Drink thy fill at the mid-day pressure! Living in\nwealth, do thou bestow wealth upon us!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII, 74. A. Charm for curing scrofulous sores called apakit](av028.htm)\n\n'
