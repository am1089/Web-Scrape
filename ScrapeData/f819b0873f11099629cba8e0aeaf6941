Not in the case of the third (place), as it is thus perceived.\n\nThe third 'place' does not, for the origination of a new body, depend on the\nfifth oblation. The term,'the third\n\np. 595\n\nplace,' denotes mere evil-doers. That these do not, for the origination of a\nnew body, depend on the fifth oblation, is seen from Scripture. For, in answer\nto the question 'Do you know why that world never becomes full?' the text\nsays, 'On neither of these two ways are those small creatures continually\nreturning, of whom it may be said, Live and die. This is the third place.\nTherefore that world never becomes full.' As this passage states that in\nconsequence of 'the third place' (i.e. the creatures forming a third class)\nnot ascending to and descending from the heavenly world that world never\nbecomes full, it follows that that third place does not, for the origination\nof bodies, depend on the fifth oblation. The clause, 'in the fifth oblation,'\nmoreover, merely states that the connexion of water with the fifth fire is the\ncause of the water 'being called man' (i. e. becoming an embryo), but does not\ndeny the origination of embryos in other ways; for the text contains no word\nasserting such a limitation.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 19.
