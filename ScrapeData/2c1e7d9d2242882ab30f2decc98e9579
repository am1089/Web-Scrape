The Imperishable (is Brahman) on account of (its) supporting (all things)\nup to ether.\n\nWe read (B _ri_. Up. III, 8, 7; 8). 'In what then is the ether woven, like\nwarp and woof?--He said: O Gargi, the Brahma _n_ as call this the akshara (the\nImperishable). It is neither coarse nor fine,' and so on.--Here the doubt\narises whether the word 'akshara' means 'syllable' or 'the highest Lord.'\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that the word 'akshara' means 'syllable' merely,\nbecause it has, in such terms as akshara-samamnaya, the meaning of 'syllable;'\nbecause we have no right to disregard the settled meaning of a word; and\nbecause another scriptural passage also ('The syllable Om is all this,' _Kh_.\nUp. II, 23, 4) declares a syllable, represented as the object of devotion, to\nbe the Self of all.\n\nTo this we reply that the highest Self only is denoted by the word 'akshara.'\n--Why?--Because it (the akshara) is said to support the entire aggregate of\neffects, from earth up to ether. For the sacred text declares at first that\nthe entire aggregate of effects beginning with earth and differentiated by\nthreefold time is based on ether, in which it is 'woven like warp and woof;'\nleads then (by means of the question, 'In what then is the ether woven, like\nwarp and woof?') over to the akshara, and, finally, concludes with the words,\n'In that akshara then, O Gargi, the ether is woven, like warp and woof.'--Now\nthe attribute of supporting everything up to ether cannot be ascribed to any\nbeing but Brahman. The text (quoted from the _Kh_. Up.) says indeed that the\nsyllable Om is all this, but that statement\n\np. 170\n\nis to be understood as a mere glorification of the syllable Om considered as a\nmeans to obtain Brahman.--Therefore we take akshara to mean either 'the\nImperishable' or 'that which pervades;' on the ground of either of which\nexplanations it must be identified with the highest Brahman.\n\nBut--our opponent resumes--while we must admit that the above reasoning holds\ngood so far that the circumstance of the akshara supporting all things up to\nether is to be accepted as a proof of all effects depending on a cause, we\npoint out that it may be employed by those also who declare the pradhana to be\nthe general cause. How then does the previous argumentation specially\nestablish Brahman (to the exclusion of the pradhana)?--The reply to this is\ngiven in the next Sutra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 11](sbe34080.htm)\n\n"
