Like unto excellent wealth, like unto the shine of the sun, like unto\nliving breath, like unto one's own [1](sbe46016.htm#an_1:66:1:1) son--\n\n2\\. Like unto a quick takvan [1](sbe46016.htm#an_1:66:2:1) he (Agni) holds the\nwood, like milk, like a milch cow [2](sbe46016.htm#an_1:66:2:2), bright and\nshining.\n\n3\\. He holds safety, pleasant like a homestead, like ripe barley, a conqueror\nof men,\n\n4\\. Like a _Ri_ shi uttering (sacred) shouts, praised among the clans; like a\nwell-cared-for race-horse [1](sbe46016.htm#an_1:66:4:1), Agni bestows vigour.\n\n5\\. He to whose flame men do not grow accustomed\n[1](sbe46016.htm#an_1:66:5:1), who is like one's own mind\n[2](sbe46016.htm#an_1:66:5:2), like a wife on a couch, enough for all\n(happiness).\n\n6\\. When the bright (Agni) has shone forth, he is like a white (horse [?])\n[1](sbe46016.htm#an_1:66:6:1) among people, like a chariot with golden\nornaments, impetuous in fights.\n\n7\\. Like an army which is sent forward he shows his vehemence, like an\narcher's shaft with sharp point.\n\n8\\. He who is born is one twin; he who will be born\n[1](sbe46016.htm#an_1:66:8:1) is the other twin--the lover of maidens, the\nhusband of wives [2](sbe46016.htm#an_1:66:8:2).\n\n9 [1](sbe46016.htm#an_1:66:9:1). As cows go to their stalls, all that moves\nand we, for the sake of a dwelling, reach him who has been kindled.\n\n10\\. Like the flood of the Sindhu [1](sbe46016.htm#an_1:66:10:1) he has driven\nforward the downwards-flowing (waters) [2](sbe46016.htm#an_1:66:10:2). The\ncows lowed at the sight of the sun [3](sbe46016.htm#an_1:66:10:3).\n\np. 58\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi and metre.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Comp. I, 166, 2; 185, 2; X, 39, 14. The second passage (nityam na\nsunum pitro _h_ upasthe dya\xc2\xb4va rakshatam p _ri_ thivi na _h_ abhvat) would be\nsufficient to show that we cannot translate 'wie ein uberlebender sohn'\n(Ludwig).\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. We do not know what animal the takvan is. Comp. I, 134, 5 with M. M.'s\nnote.\n\nNote 2. See Bergaigne, Mel. Renier, 101; Gaedicke, 253.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Comp. X, 101, 7. pri _n_ ita a _s_ van hitam _g_ ayatha.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Comp. VII, 4, 3. durokam agni _h_ ayave _s_ u _s_ o _k_ a.\n\nNote 2. Prof. Max Muller believes that kratu here means, 'like kart _ri_ , a\nsacrificer, so that kratu _h_ na nitya _h_ sounds like sunu _h_ na nitya _h_ ,\none's own sacrificing son. But all this is very obscure.'\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. The second Pada is translated by Grassmann: 'wie Licht in Hausern;' by\nLudwig: 'fast weiss, bei den menschenstammen.' I think that there can be no\ndoubt that the words _s_ veta _h_ na contain a comparison like all the other\ncomparisons of which these hymns are full; this comparison is unduly effaced\nin Ludwig's translation. Nor is Grassmann right in translating _s_ veta _h_\nbei 'Licht;' the word is an adjective meaning 'white' and nothing else. We\nmust supply here, as in many passages, a substantive, and I do not see any\nreason why this should not be that\n\np. 59\n\nsubstantive with which _s_ veta is most frequently combined in the Rig-veda,\nnamely a _s_ va; comp. I, 116, 6; 118, 9 [119, 10]; VII, 77, 3; X, 39, 10. In\nV, 1, 4 it is said of Agni: sveta _h_ va _g_ i\xc2\xb4 _g_ ayate agre ahnam, 'the\nwhite racer is born in the beginning of the days.'\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. The traditional text is yama _h_ ha _g_ ata _h_ yama _h_ _g_ anitvam.\nLudwig translates 'bewaltiger des gebornen, bewaltiger auch des, was erst\ngeboren wird.' It will scarcely be necessary to state the reasons which make\nagainst this translation. Yama _h_ \xe2\x80\xa6 yama _h_ evidently means: 'the one twin \xe2\x80\xa6\nthe other twin.' Now if we leave the text unchanged, we cannot but translate:\n'the one twin is he who has been born, the other twin is that which will be\nborn'--which sounds very strange. In I, 89, to we have aditi _h_ _g_ atam\naditi _h_ _g_ anitvam; IV, 18, 4. anta _h_ _g_ ateshu uta ye _g_ anitva _h_ ;\nX, 45, 10. ut _g_ atena bhinadat ut _g_ anitvai _h_. In all these cases _g_\nata and _g_ anitva stand parallel; there is no such difference as in our\npassage, according to the traditional text, between him (masc.) who is \xe2\x80\xa6 and\nthat (neuter) which will be \xe2\x80\xa6 Thus I propose to read _g_ anitva _h_ , of which\nconjecture Ludwig has thought also (see his note, IV, 259): that present Agni\nwho has been born, and that future Agni who will be born, are twins.--Prof.\nMax Muller has discussed this passage in his Science of Language, II, 630\nseqq. He interprets the twin who has been born as Agni representing the\nmorning; the twin who will be born as the evening.\n\nNote 2. The maidens very probably are the dawns (comp. Prof. Max Muller's\ndiscussion quoted in the last note). Are the wives the sacrificial ladles\nwhich approach Agni, or the offerings of ghee, or the prayers? See Bergaigne,\nRel. Vedique, II, 9 seqq.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. This verse is very obscure, and I am quite aware of the merely\ntentative character of the translation which\n\np. 60\n\n[paragraph continues] I propose. I leave va _h_ untranslated (comp. Delbruck,\nAltindische Syntax, 206), which must be done in most of the numerous verses\nbeginning with the words tam va _h_. I then read _k_ aratha (comp. 68, 1; 70,\n3. 7). Vasatya\xc2\xb4 seems to be either a dative similar to the newly-discovered\ndatives in -a of a-stems, or we possibly should read vasatyai (vasatya\xc2\xb4 in the\nSa _m_ hita-pa _th_ a).--Prof. Max Muller thinks of a correction _k_ arama _h_\nand would translate: 'To him (whom you know--va _h_ ) when lighted we go for\nour dwelling, as the cows reach their home.'\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. Comp. above, 65, 6.\n\nNote 2. Or the downwards-streaming libations of Gh _ri_ ta and the like? Comp.\nbelow, I, 72, 10 with note 4.\n\nNote 3. Comp. below, 69, 10.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 67](sbe46017.htm)\n\n"
