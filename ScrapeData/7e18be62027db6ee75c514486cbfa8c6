Who uttered a doubt that\nIndia had a place and a life for women? Certainly none who had ever seen a\npilgrimage. Marching along we meet them, singly or in couples, or maybe in\nlong strings of tens and twenties, old and young mingled together. There is\nneither fear nor exaggerated shyness in their demeanour. Sometimes one will be\nseparated by a few yards from her party, telling her beads, or lost in\nsolitary thought. Sometimes, again, we meet an old woman who seems to belong\nto none. But almost everyone is cheerful, and almost all, from the custom of\nwearing their jewels all the time, have an air of festivity and brightness.\nAll pilgrims know one another. Here none of the stiffness of a meaner world\nprevails. We all speak to one another as we pass. _Jai! Kedar Nath Swami ki\nJai!_ or _Jai! Badri Bissai lal ki Jai!_ we say to each whom we meet, whether\nman or woman. And no words can describe the flash of sweetness\n\np. 190\n\nand brightness that lights up the reply. We are all out on a holiday together,\nand an air of gentle innocence and hilarity prevails in face of difficulties\nand creates a sort of freemasonry amongst all who seek the common goal. One\nhas the chance here of studying the refinement of Eastern salutations,\nSometimes a wayfarer passes who is telling her beads, or who, for some reason\nor another, does not care to break her silence: but oh, the dignity and charm\nof the bow that answers the pilgrim\'s salutation in such a case! Even here, in\nan environment which is in some ways one of intensified practicality, we meet\nnow and again with the inveterate dreamer, living in that world upon whose\nshores no wave can break. It was turning into the wedge-shaped ravine of\nGarurganga that we came upon one such. She was a little old woman, and we\ncaught her just as she had stepped out of her prim little shoes, placed neatly\nbehind her, and with rapt look prostrated herself. Two people who were coming\nforward drew back at this, that she might not know herself interrupted, and\nthen as again we stepped forward and came face to face with her, we saw that\nfor the moment she was lost in the world of her own reverence. In her eyes was\nthe look of one who saw not the earth. It was a sudden glimpse of the snow\nmountains to which she had paid involuntary homage.\n\np. 191\n\nClimbing over some peculiarly difficult boulders in the dry bed of a torrent,\nwe met two old women, both almost blind, and bent half-double with age and\ninfirmity. They were coming back from Badri Narayan. The place was terrible,\nand as we came up to them one of them stumbled. But to an ejaculation of\nconcern, they replied, between themselves, with an air of triumph in their\ngaiety, "What! Is not Narayan leading? And since He has given _darsana_ , what\ndoes this matter?"\n\n#### I.--HARDWAR AND HRISHIKESH\n\nHappy they whose pilgrimage can begin at Hardwar! Never surely was there a\nplace so beautiful. It is like Benares on a very small scale. But as one of\nour party remarked, people go to Benares to die, and to Hardwar as the\nbeginning of a high undertaking. This of itself confers on the town an air of\nbrightness. In the moonlight nights the _jatris_ set out with their _pandas_ ,\nsinging, as they go, along the roads. And oh, the evening worship of the\nGanges! In the very middle of the lowest step of the semicircular _gh ats_ of\nthe Brahma Kund a priest stands waving what looks like a small brass tree of\nflame. Behind him crowd the worshippers, chiefly women, and on the bridge and\nisland that stretch across\n\np. 192\n\nthe little bay in front of him, forming the chord of the semicircle, stand and\nsit other worshippers, obviously, to judge by differences of dress and type,\ntravellers from many and various provinces. All is rapt silence while the\npublic worship is proceeding, but as it ends the whole multitude breaks out\ninto chanting. Choir upon choir they sing the glories of the Ganges, answering\neach other in the manner of an antiphon. And away beyond them stretch green\nislands and wooded heights, about which the blue veil of the evening mists has\njust begun to fall. The very scene in itself is the perfection of praise. "O\nye mountains and hills, bless ye the Lord! Praise Him and magnify Him for\never! O ye rivers and streams, bless ye the Lord! Praise Him and magnify Him\nfor ever!"\n\nIt is the railway, we are told, that has popularised Hardwar. Until a few\nyears ago, Kankhal had been long the recognised centre, and people made\npilgrimage only to Hardwar for bathing and praying, being exceedingly careful\nto be back before nightfall, so probable was the experience of a tiger on the\nroad between the two places. But the fact that the habit of pilgrimage could\npersist at all under such circumstances is eloquent testimony to the age of\nthe place. Kankhal itself, a couple of miles away, is the seat of Shiva as\nDaksheshwar, and therefore, we cannot doubt, one\n\np. 193\n\nof the most ancient sites of Hinduism. Here we are shown the very place where\nSati fell, and that where Daksha offered sacrifice. Suddenly a whole chapter\nof pre-Hindu Hinduism--perhaps ages long--becomes visible to us. We see that\nthere was a time when people were familiar with the image of the goat-headed\nLord of Creation. We remember the Great God Pan of the Greeks, with his one\ngoat-foot. And we do not wonder that there should have been a struggle between\nthis old nature-god Daksha, who may have been a personification of the Polar\nStar, and the new Shiva, Lord of the consciences of men.\n\nHrishikesh, twelve miles away from Hardwar, is a university of an ancient\ntype. Here, amongst some of the most beautiful scenery of the Himalayas, just\nat the rapids of the Ganges, are hundreds of straw huts in which live\n_sadhus_. Amongst these it is doubtless possible to realise the ideal of the\nVedic _ashramas_ , in a life of simplicity, order, and learning. The first\nduty of the new arrival is, as I have heard, to build his own hut. Within,\nthese men live alone or in couples, according to the merciful custom that\nusually carries the begging friars forth, not alone, but by twos. But when\nevening comes, at any rate in the winter, the great meditation fires are\nlighted here and there, in the open air, and seated round them the monks\ndiscourse "of settled things."\n\np. 194\n\n[paragraph continues] Then they relapse by degrees into the depths of thought,\nand when darkness has fallen and all is quiet, one after another each man\nslips quietly away to his own hut. It is an extraordinary combination of\nfreedom and society, of the ideals of the hermitage and of the monastery. It\nmay be that it gives us a glimpse of the monastic conditions of the Thebaid,\nbut in modern times it could certainly be paralleled nowhere outside India.\nThe _sadabratas_ in the little town close by are another institution\ncorresponding to nothing in foreign countries. Here the _sadhus_ daily receive\ntheir rations of food, some cooked and some uncooked. For it is a mistake to\nthink that those who have taken up the life of the _sannyasin_ can study and\nthink without a certain amount of bodily nourishment. Our selfishness may make\nus eager to preach such an ideal, but it will always be for others to realise!\nAt the same time the sadabratas relieve the monks of the dishonour of becoming\nbeggars, and the community of the scandal of a disorderly burden. These, in\ntheir present high organisation and development, owe a great deal to the life\nand work of Kambliwala Baba, one of the national heroes whose name is known\ntoo little outside monastic ranks. By his labours the Northern Pilgrimage has\nbeen rendered available for the thousands of pilgrims who now pass along it,\nand it is to be hoped\n\np. 195\n\nthat in the movement now going on for the recovery of biographies, his will\nnot be forgotten. The present road from Hardwar to Hrishikesh, with its new\ntemple and bazaar of Satya Narayan, is of Kambliwala Baba\'s making, as are all\nthe good _dharmsalas_ along the road. The old way to Hrishikesh lay along the\nGanges-bank. In the desert-like country about Hrishikesh, one of the\ncharacteristic charities is the little water-and-mat stations, where a _gerua_\n-turbaned servant lives in a little hut, serving out water to each passer-by\nwho asks for it, and keeping a clean space swept where anyone can lie down on\na mat in the shade of a tree.\n\nHow old is Hrishikesh? In its very nature it is impermanent. The materials of\nwhich it is built this winter will not remain after next summer\'s rains. And\nhow long the site has been used in this way, who shall say? Maybe the history\nof Hardwar would give us some clue to this. Maybe the _Kumbh Mela_ would help\nus to calculate its age. The very fleetingness of its buildings must have\nlengthened its days, for political convulsions that would sweep clean the\ncaves of Ajanta or Ellora would leave this winter-resort of the learned and\npious entirely unaffected. As the waters of a lake close over a stone, so\nwould Hrishikesh recover from catastrophe and grow out of its very memory. And\nthe tradition\n\np. 196\n\ngoes, we must remember, that one of the earliest literary undertakings of the\npeople--the division of the Vedas by Vyasa into four--was carried out in this\nplace.\n\n#### II.--SRINAGAR\n\nWe reached Srinagar five days after leaving Hardwar. The present town stands\nnear the centre of a wide flat vale, in which the cactus and the bo-tree\nproclaim a sub-tropical climate. It is obviously new, having been rebuilt on a\nslightly different site so lately as the time of the Gohonna flood about\nfifteen years ago. This event was a great epoch-maker throughout the valleys\nleading up to Badri Narayan. It swept away ancient temples and images, and\nnecessitated the rebuilding of many a town and village. One cannot but mourn\nthe loss of historic remains of priceless interest, but at the same time one\nsuspects that, from a sanitary and cleansing point of view, the flood may have\ndone more good than harm. Like the great fire of London in 1666, it seems to\nhave wiped out the past and banished disease-germs as well as carvings.\n\nSrinagar has been rebuilt, as already said, since the flood, but the site of\nthe older city is still evident enough, as one enters from the south, by the\nclustering of temples and shrines among the\n\np. 197\n\ncactus hedges and peepul-trees of the wide open plain. There are many still\nolder temples to be seen from the road, of a ponderous and severe beauty, in a\ntype immediately preceding that of mediaeval Orissa. They are comparatively\nsmall but marvellously perfect. The style must have persisted long in the\nHimalayas. There are examples of it, in more developed and slender form, here\nat Srinagar, as modern as two hundred years old; but the earliest examples\nmust be very old indeed, dating from the days of the Hindu Revival under the\nGuptas, that is to say from about A.D. 400 or even earlier. Even the town of\nSrinagar, as it was at the time of the flood, was only founded, it is said, by\nRaja Ajaipal in the year 1446, so that it could not be regarded as old from an\nIndian point of view. But the fact is there must always have been a city here,\never since the Himalayas began to be inhabited, and certainly ever since the\ncoming of the Asokan missions.\n\nThe geographical situation, in the midst of a valley that is almost a plain,\nforces the formation of an organic centre. The height is only about sixteen\nhundred feet above the sea, so it supports a sub-tropical vegetation and at\nthe same time is accessible to all the cooler airs of the higher mountains. We\ncan well imagine how the first colony of Buddhistic monks would gradually\n\np. 198\n\nsettle down, and live their monastic life, with its regular worship,\npreaching, and study, contented in the main to become an organic part of the\nlife about them. Actual traces of their occupation have all been obliterated\nlong long ago, but wherever we find a very old religious dedication, which has\nbeen a sheet-anchor of worship for century after century, we may infer with\nsome certainty that it was established by them. Such centres exist at Srinagar\nin the Temples of Komoleswar and of the Five Pandavas. Of the two, Komoleswar\nis probably the older. The story told in the Puranas of the Mother, is here\nappropriated to Shiva, and he appears as the god to whom Rama made the\noffering of blue lotuses. There is a Shiva here of pre-Sankaracharyan type,\nand the temple stands in a large and ancient enclosure round which are houses\nand other buildings. Vaishnavism also has flowed over Komoleswar in its time,\nfor there are scores of votive tablets carved with the feet of the Lord. But\nthe place has never forgotten its Shaivite origin, and claims to have been\nvisited by Sankaracharya, which we should certainly expect to have been the\ncase. The old temple of the Five Pandavas stands on the roadway into Srinagar.\n\nWas there once an intention of laying out the whole country with temples\ndedicated in order\n\np. 199\n\nto the heroes and _munis_ of the national epic? One shrinks from the thought\nof a task so gigantic, but there seems some reason to think it may have been\ncontemplated, and the fact that most of these must since have disappeared is\nno real argument against it. The Himalayan kingdom has always been in such\nvital contact with the Hinduism of the plains, through _sadhus_ and pilgrims\nand merchants, that it has shared to the full in each period as it rose, and\neach wave has been followed by another striving to efface the traces of that\nwhich preceded it. In this particular temple of the Five Pandavas, the\nVaishnavism of Ramanuja has left its mark. There is a grotesque image of\nNarada worshipped here which is said to commemorate the primeval _swayambara_\n, where Narayana chose Lakshmi to be his spouse. The bride shrank from the\nappearance of Narada, who sat immediately in front of his master, and looked\nat Narayana himself instead. This was indeed the end to be attained, for she\nwas the destined bride of God. But the method involved a wound to Narada\'s\nself-love, and for this he cursed Vishnu--the devotee cursed God!--saying that\nin a future birth as Rama he would have trouble with this wife. This is\nevidently a late and corrupt tale, intended to appropriate an image said to be\nNarada\'s, and to synthetise all the developments through which Vaishnavism had\n\np. 200\n\nalready passed, claiming them as historic phases of the mediaeval form\npreached by Ramanuja.\n\nVaishnavism made a strong impression at Srinagar. It seems to have been held\nmeritorious to make a pilgrimage there, and give offerings at the shrine of\nLakshmi-Narayan, in lieu of going all the way to Badri Narayan. There is one\ngrand old temple erected for this purpose four hundred years ago.\nUnfortunately it is now surrounded by a cactus-hedge, and is therefore\n\ninaccessible. It was superseded two hundred years later by a building of much\npoorer architecture. But the traditions are interesting. The Garur in front of\nthe later temple is believed to be inferior to that which originally stood\nthere. This, it is said, was so beautiful that it flew away! "Even this," the\nguide will add, with pardonable pride in local gods, "is such as you will not\noften see." Alas, I could not share his high opinion of the present Garur as a\nwork of art.\n\nThere have been many Srinagars, and one of them at least would seem to have\nbeen connected with the consecration of a great rock altar to Devi. If the\ntradition is to be trusted, human sacrifice was practised here, and there is a\nstory of the splendid indignation of Sankaracharya, who hurled the stone of\nsacrifice upside down into the river, and left to the sight of future\ngenerations only its bottom. If that was so, Sankaracharya would\n\np. 201\n\nappear not only as the enemy of Tantrikism, but also as the reformer of\nMother-worship in this matter. The rock is some miles out of the present town,\nand stands near a great deodar cedar on the opposite bank.\n\n#### III.--KEDAR NATH\n\nThe final stage of the road to Kedar Nath is terrible, especially the last\nfour miles of steep ascent. About the beauty of the scenery one could not say\nenough, but the difficulties of the climb ought not to be forgotten. It is a\ndolorous stairway, as hard as life itself; in very truth, as the _panda_\nruefully said to me, "the way to Heaven!" All this is forgotten, however, when\nat last we reach the uplands and begin to feel ourselves within measurable\ndistance of Kedar Nath. We are now amongst the wide turf-covered tablelands,\nand the flowers begin to abound, as in some paradise of Moghul painters. At\nevery step we pass or are passed by other pilgrims. The eagerness round and\nabout us is indescribable. Then comes the moment when the temple is visible\nfor the first time. A shout goes up from our carriers and others, and many\nprostrate themselves. We press forward more rapidly than before. It is even\nnow a mile or so to the village. But at last we arrive, and entering find\n\np. 202\n\nthat the shrine itself stands at the end of the long avenue-like street, with\nthe mountain and glacier rising sheer behind it, as if all India converged\nupon Kedar Nath as its northern point, and all roads met at the sacred feet of\nthe Lord of Mountains. Probably, when first the temple was built in this spot,\nit was actually on the edge of the glacier, which in all these centuries has\nretreated only to a distance of less than a mile. We had made great efforts to\nreach our goal on a Monday, for this is held a great benison in visiting a\nshrine of Shiva. But when we arrived it was the middle of the day, and the\ntemple was closed till the evening _arati_. As the afternoon ended, the cold\nblue mists came down from the mountains, enwrapping everything; and one sat\nout in the village street, watching cowled forms, in their brown _kombols_ ,\npacing back and forth through the mist before the tight-shut doors. Suddenly\nwe were called to see the _arati_. Darkness had fallen but the mists had gone,\nand the stars and the snows were clear and bright. Lights were blazing and\nbells clanging within the temple and we stood without, among the watching\npeople. As the lights ceased to swing and the _arati_ ended, a shout of\nrapture went up from the waiting crowd. Then the cry went out to clear the\nroad, and the rush of the pilgrims up the steep steps began. What a sight was\nthis! On and on, up and up, they came, crowding, breathless, almost\n\np. 203\n\nstruggling, in their mad anxiety to enter the shrine, reach the image, and at\nthe last, by way of worship, to bend forward and touch with the heart the\nsacred point of the mountain! For this half-embrace is what the worship\nconsists of at Kedar Nath. They poured in at the great south door, out by the\neast. On and on, up and up; one had not dreamed the place contained so many\npeople as now panted forward to obtain entrance. Suddenly, from one of the\ndoorkeepers I heard an exclamation of pity, and then he stooped and tenderly\nlifted a little bent old woman, bowed down under the weight of years, who had\nlost her footing in the crowd and might have fallen and been trodden under\nfoot. It was one of the sights of a lifetime to stand there, in the black\ndarkness at the top of the steps, and watch the pilgrims streaming in. It\nseemed as if all India lay stretched before one, and Kedar Nath were its apex,\nwhile from all parts everywhere, by every road, one could see the people\nstreaming onward, battling forward, climbing their way up, all for what?--for\nnothing else than to touch God!\n\n\n\nWe had a wonderful walk next day, to the glaciers and the heights, and some of\nus rested on a hillside, listening to the perpetual muffled boom of the\navalanches, as they broke and fell\n\np. 204\n\nfrom some part or other of the great ice-mass to the north. "Yes," said the\npeasant who guided us, thoughtfully, as he stood gazing with us at the\nglacier. "It looks as if it stood perfectly still. But really it is moving,\nlike any other river." The great temple looked small and distant now, like a\nvillage church, and only the towering heights seemed grand enough for the\nworship of God. We felt this still more when we stood and looked up at the\nvast snowy expanse that they call the Mahaprasthan, the Great Release. For the\nPandava story culminates at Kedar Nath, and we are shown the very road by\nwhich Yudhisthira and his brothers and the Lady Draupadi went, on that last\ngreat journey by which they reached the end. Others since then have followed\nthem, it is said, and have signed their names at the last on a great rock-face\nthat stands on the way. We made our way there: and sure enough we found\nnumbers of trisuls drawn in white and black and red, in wavering lines some of\nthem, as if by hands that shook with age, and some of them strong and firm:\nbut all, if the country-folk are to be believed, the autographs of those who\nfelt that desire was ended and the supreme renunciation now theirs to make.\nFor the _Shastras_ , say those who know, make man free of society at two\nplaces, Kedar Nath and Allahabad.\n\nThe site of Kedar Nath is very old. There is\n\np. 205.\n\na temple of Satya-Narayana built over a spring, in the village-street. There\nis also a tiny chapel containing the nine forms of Devi. There are pre-\nSankaracharyan Shivas also, and square watercourses, dotted about the central\nshrine. On the whole it would seem as if, at the period commonly referred to\nas the visit of Sankaracharya, Satya-Narayana had been superseded by Shiva as\nthe principal deity. And the Devi-worship which was probably still older than\nSatya-Narayana remained henceforth side by side with it, in a similar\nsubordination. The question of the order in which its pre-Sankaracharyan\nphases succeeded one another is the great crux of the story of Hinduism.\n\nThe carving round the doorway of the temple is evidently ancient, and the\nornament consists of Hinduistic figures of gods and kings contained in niches,\nnot unlike those which contain Buddhas in the last of the art-periods at\nAjanta. This would predispose us to assign a date between the expulsion from\nGandhara, A.D. 751, and the year 1000, leaning somewhat to the latter because\nof the very manifest decadence in style. We must remember that the importance\nof Kedar Nath as a place of pilgrimage has always kept it in touch with the\nplains, and that at the same time there seems never to have been any\nMohammedan invasion of these Himalayan valleys. These\n\np. 206\n\nfacts explain why it is possible to find in this remote spot an important link\nbetween older Buddhistic and later Hindu sculpture.\n\nAbove all, Kedar Nath is the shrine of the _sadhus_. As in the days of\nBuddhism, so in those of Sankaracharya, and as then so also now, the yellow\nrobe gleams and glistens in all directions. There is no begging, for the\n_sadabratas_ supply all the wants of monastic visitors. But there is a world\nof enthusiasm, and still the tradition goes amongst them that Kedar Nath is a\nplace of good omen for _sannyasins_ , for here came Sankaracharya and falling\ninto _samadhi_ died.\n\nIt was the second day of our stay when an old man who had been seriously ill\nfor many months reached the place and made his _darsana_. He had ended his\njourney, and hastened to fulfil his vow within the hour. But scarcely had he\ndone so, barely had he ceased from prayer, not yet was the rapture of\nachievement abated, when the battle was declared for him to be finished, and\nin the bright morning air, with long sighing breaths, his soul went forth.\nSuch is the benediction with which the Lord of Mountains lays His hand upon\nHis own!\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[189:1](seh27.htm#fr_5) See note, [p. 207](seh28.htm#page_207).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Note to the Northern Pilgrimage](seh28.htm)\n\n'
