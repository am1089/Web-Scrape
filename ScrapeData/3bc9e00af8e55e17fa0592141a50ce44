The\ncommentator in the Bombay edition explains the word _S\' akhantaram_ as\nYajanadina rakshantaram, \'one who by sacrificing for thee, etc., will be\nanother protector.\' Gorresio\'s Gauda*? text, which may often be used as a\ncommentary on the older one, has the following paraphrase of the words in\nquestion, ch. 60, 3. Mulam utsrijya*? kasmat tvam s\'akasv ichhasi lambitum*?.\n\'Why, forsaking the root, dost thou desire to hang upon the branches?\'" MUIR,\nSanskrit Texts, Vol. I., p. 401.\n\n[69:2b](ry058.htm#fr_236) A Chandala was a man born of the illegal and impure\nunion of a S\'udra with a woman of one of the three higher castes.\n\n[70:1](ry058.htm#fr_237) The Chandala was regarded as the vilest and most\nabject of the men sprung from wedlock forbidden by the law\n(Manavadharmas\'astra, Lib. X. 12.); a kind of social malediction weighed upon\nhis head and rejected him from human society.\' GORRESIO.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LIX.: The Sons of Vas\'ishtha.](ry059.htm)\n\n'
