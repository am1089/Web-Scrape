Now (follows the exposition) of the study of the Veda.\n\n2 2. Both sit down to the north of the fire,\n\n3\\. The teacher with his face to the east, the other one to the west.\n\n4 4. After (the student) has reverentially saluted the teacher's feet and has\nsprinkled his (own) hands (with water),\n\n5\\. And has kneeled down with his right knee on young Ku _s_ a shoots at their\nroots,\n\n6 6. And has grasped round (those Ku _s_ a shoots) in 'heir middle with his\nhands, holding the right uppermost,\n\n7\\. The teacher, having seized them at their tops\n\np. 70\n\nwith his left hand, and with his right hand sprinkling them with water, then\nmakes the other say:\n\n8 8. 'Recite the Savitri, sir!' says the other.\n\n9\\. 'I recite the Savitri to thee!' says the teacher.\n\n10 10. 'Recite the Gayatri, sir!' says the other.\n\n'I recite the Gayatri to thee!' says the teacher.\n\n11\\. 'Recite the verse of Vi _s_ vamitra, sir!' says the other.\n\n'I recite the verse of Vi _s_ vamitra to thee!' says the teacher.\n\n12\\. 'Recite the _Ri_ shis, sir!' says the other.\n\nI recite the _Ri_ shis to thee!' says the teacher.\n\n13\\. 'Recite the deities, sir!' says the other.\n\n'I recite the deities to thee!' says the teacher.\n\n14\\. 'Recite the metres, sir!' says the other.\n\n'I recite the metres to thee!' says the teacher.\n\n15\\. 'Recite the _S_ ruti, sir!' says the other.\n\n'I recite the _S_ ruti to thee!' says the teacher.\n\n16\\. 'Recite the Sm _ri_ ti, sir!' says the other.\n\n'I recite the Sm _ri_ ti to thee!' says the teacher.\n\n17 17. 'Recite faith and insight, sir!' says the other.\n\n'I recite faith and insight to thee!' says the teacher.\n\np. 71\n\n18 18-20. In that way, according to what _Ri_ shi each hymn belongs to and\nwhat its deity and its metre is, thus (with the corresponding indications of\n_Ri_ shi, &c.) let him recite each hymn;\n\n19 19. Or also, if he does not know the _Ri_ shis, deities, and metres, the\nteacher recites this verse, 'That glorious (splendour) of Savitar' (Rig-veda\nIII, 62, 10), pada by pada, hemistich by hemistich, (and finally) without a\nstop, and says, when he has finished, 'This (verse belongs to Savitar; it is a\nGayatri; Vi _s_ vamitra is its _Ri_ shi).'\n\np. 72\n\n20\\. Let him thus recite (the hymns belonging to) each _Ri_ shi, or (each)\nAnuvaka;\n\n21 21. Of the short hymns (in the tenth Ma _n_ _d_ ala) an Anuvaka,\n\n22\\. Or as much as the master may think fit.\n\n23\\. Or optionally he may recite the first and last hymn of (each) _Ri_ shi,\n\n24 24. Or of (each) Anuvaka,\n\n25\\. (Or) one (verse) of the beginning of each hymn.\n\n26\\. The teacher may optionally say at the beginning of the hymn, 'This is the\ncommencement.'\n\n27 27. This has been (further) explained in (the treatise about) the _Ri_\nshisvadhyaya.\n\np. 73\n\n28 28. When (the lesson) is finished, he takes the young Ku _s_ a shoots,\nmakes of cow-dung a pit at their roots, and sprinkles water on the Ku _s_ a\n(shoots) for each hymn.\n\n29 29. For the rest of the day standing and fasting.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[69:1](sbe29037.htm#fr_148) 7, 1. Naraya _n_ a: 'Now (atha), i.e. after the\nobservance of the _S_ ukriya vrata,' &c. On the Sukriya vrata which has to be\nundergone before the Anuva _k_ ana treated of in this chapter can be\nperformed, see the note on chap. 4, 1, and below, chap. II, 9. One would have\nexpected that in the arrangement of _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana the rites belonging to the\nSukriya vrata would precede the exposition of the Anuva _k_ ana. Perhaps it\nwas in consequence of the exact analogy of the Sukriya with the _S_ akvara,\nVratika, Aupanishada vratas, that the description of the former has been\npostponed till the latter had to be treated of.\n\nRama _k_ andra's Paddhati has the following remark here, 'Now the way of\nstudying the Veda, called Anuva _k_ ana, is set forth. This can be done only\nafter the Sukriya vrata has been enjoined on the student; before that nothing\nbut the Savitri can be taught to him.'\n\n[69:2](sbe29037.htm#fr_149) 2 seq. Comp. above, chap. 2, 8 seq.\n\n[69:4](sbe29037.htm#fr_150) The way in which this reverential salutation\nshould be performed is described below, IV, 12, 1 seq.\n\n[69:6](sbe29037.htm#fr_151) On dakshi _n_ ottarabhyam, see chap. 2, 11 and\nNaraya _n_ a's note there.\n\n[70:8](sbe29037.htm#fr_152) 8 seq. Comp. Weber's Indische Studien, vol. x, p.\n131 seq.\n\n[70:10](sbe29037.htm#fr_153) Comp. the note on chap. 5, 4-6. Naraya _n_ a\nstates, in accordance with these Sutras of the fifth chapter, that in case the\nstudent belongs to the second or third caste, an \xc3\x9bha (i.e. a corresponding\nalteration of the formulas; from the _S_ rauta-sutra, VI, 1, 3 the definition\nis quoted here _s_ abdavikaram uha _m_ bruvate) takes place. If he is a\nKshatriya, he has to say, 'Recite the Trish _t_ ubh, sir!'\xc2\x97'Recite the verse\nof Hira _n_ yastupa (Rig-veda I, 35, 2), sir!' A Vai _s_ ya has to say,\n'Recite the _G_ agati, sir!'\xc2\x97'Recite the verse of Hira _n_ yastupa (or, of\nVamadeva, Rig-veda I, 35, 9 or IV, 40, 5), sir!'\n\n[70:17](sbe29037.htm#fr_154) Comp. Indische Studien, X, 132, note 1.\n\n[71:18-20](sbe29037.htm#fr_155) I do not think that Professor Weber (Indische\nStudien, X, 132) has quite exactly rendered the meaning of these Sutras when\nhe says, 'The teacher then (i.e. after the formula of Sutra 17 has been\npronounced) teaches him first the _Ri_ shi, the deity, and the metre of each\nMantra. In case he does not know them himself for a Mantra, he recites the\nholy Savitri (tat Savitur vare _n_ yam). After this he teaches him in due\norder either (1) the single _Ri_ shis, i.e. the hymns belonging to each _Ri_\nshi, or (2) the single Anuvakas,' &C.\xc2\x97It does not seem quite probable to me\nthat the student should have had to learn first the _Ri_ shis, deities, and\nmetres of the whole Veda, before the text of the hymns was taught him; I\nrather believe that hymn by hymn the indication of the _Ri_ shis, &c. preceded\nthe anuva _k_ ana of the text itself, and with this opinion the statement of\nNaraya _n_ a agrees, 'Eva _m_ purvoktena prakare _n_ a _ri_ shidevata _kh_\nanda _h_ purvaka _m_ ta _m_  ta _m_ Agnim i _l_ a ityadika _m_ mantra _m_ ma\n_n_ avakaya _k_ aryo\xe0\xa4\xbdnubruyat.'\n\n[71:19](sbe29037.htm#fr_156) According to Naraya _n_ a by esheti (literally,\n'This [is the _Ri_ _k_ ]') it is meant that the teacher, after having recited\nthe Savitri in the three ways mentioned, should say to the student, 'This _Ri_\n_k_ is in the Gayatri metre. If recited pada by pada, it has three padas. Thus\nalso this _Ri_ _k_ , if recited hemistich by hemistich, has two Avasanas\n(pauses), the first at the end of the hemistich, the second at the end of the\nthird _k_ arma (or pada). Thus also this _Ri_ _k_ is recited without stopping;\nat the end of the three _k_ ara _n_ as, or of the twenty-four syllables, the\npause (avasana) should be made. Thus I recite to thee the Savitri; I recite to\nthee the Gayatri; I recite to thee the verse of Vi _s_ vamitra.' 'For,' adds\nNaraya _n_ a, 'if the Gayatri has been recited, the whole complex of the Veda\nbeing of that very p. 72 substance, a complete knowledge thereof has been\nproduced.' The commentator then indicates a shorter form for the teacher's\nwords which our Sutra prescribes by esheti, 'This verse belongs to Savitar; it\nis a Gayatri; its _Ri_ shi is Vi _s_ vamitra.'\n\n[72:21](sbe29037.htm#fr_157) The Kshudrasuktas are the hymns Rig-veda X,\n129-191.\n\n[72:24](sbe29037.htm#fr_158) 24 seq. This seems to be an abridged method by\nwhich students who had not the intention of becoming Vedic scholars, and\nprobably chiefly students of the Kshatriya and Vai _s_ ya caste, could fulfil\ntheir duty of learning the Veda; a student who knew the first and last hymn of\na _Ri_ shi, or of an Anuvaka, was, as would seem from these Sutras, by a sort\nof fiction considered as though he had known the whole portion belonging to\nthat _Ri_ shi, or the whole Anuvaka.\n\n[72:27](sbe29037.htm#fr_159) Naraya _n_ a explains _Ri_ shisvadhyaya by\nmantrasa _m_ hita. He says, The Anuva _k_ ana which has been declared here, is\nto be understood also with regard to the svadhyaya, i.e. to the Sa _m_ hita of\nthe Mantras.' I think there is a blunder in the MS., and instead of tad api\nsvadhyaye . . . _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ eya _m_ we ought to read tad _ri_ shisvadhyaye . . .\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ eya _m_. In this case we should have to translate the quoted passage,\n'. . . is to be understood with regard to the _Ri_ shisvadhyaya, i.e. to,\n&c.'\xc2\x97I think, however, that the true meaning of the Sutra is different from\nwhat Naraya _n_ a believes it to be. The expression vyakhyatam apparently\nconveys a reference to another treatise in which the rules regarding the _Ri_\nshisvadhyaya would seem to have been fully set forth. The _S_ rauta-sutra\ncontains p. 73 no passage which could be the one here referred to; we may\nsuppose, therefore, that either a chapter of a Prati _s_ akhya is quoted here,\nor a separate treatise on the special subject of the _Ri_ shisvadhyaya.\nReferences to such treatises are found in the Sutra texts in several\ninstances, of which the most important is that in the Gobhila-G _ri_ hya I, 5,\n13, 'On what day the moon becomes full, the knowledge thereof is contained in\na special text; that one either should study or ascertain when the Parvan is\nfrom those who have studied it.'\n\n[73:28](sbe29037.htm#fr_160) Naraya _n_ a: 'First stand the Mantras, then the\nBrahma _n_ a, because it contains the viniyoga (the ritual use of the\nMantras), then the Sm _ri_ ti texts such as Manu, &c. When he has repeated\nthese texts to the student, after the end of the Anuva _k_ ana, the teacher\nshould take from the student the Ku _s_ a blades which had been taken up\nbefore for the sake of the Anuva _k_ ana (see Sutras 5 seq.),' &c.\xc2\x97The teacher\nis made the subject of this rule also by Rama _k_ andra. On yathasuktam Naraya\n_n_ a observes that according to some teachers these water oblations were\ndirected to the _Ri_ shis of the different hymns ( _ri_ shin uddi _s_ yeti ke\n_k_ it). This statement seems to be countenanced by IV, 6, 6. Comp. the note\nbelow on IV, 9, 1.\n\n[73:29](sbe29037.htm#fr_161) 'This rule concerns the Brahma _k_ arin.' Naraya\n_n_ a.
