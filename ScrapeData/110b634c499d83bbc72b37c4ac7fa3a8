The hi\xe1\xb9\x85kara is, he rubs (the fire-stick); the prastava, smoke rises; the\nudgitha, it burns; the pratihara, there are glowing coals; the nidhana, it\ngoes down; the nidhana, it is gone out. This is the Rathantara Saman as\ninterwoven in fire 3.\n\n2\\. He who thus knows this Rathantara interwoven in fire, becomes radiant 4\nand strong. He reaches the full life, he lives long, becomes great with\nchildren and cattle, great by fame.
