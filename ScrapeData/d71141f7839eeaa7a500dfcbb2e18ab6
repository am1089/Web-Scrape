For the same reason breath (is Brahman).\n\nWe read in the _Kh_ andogya (I, 10; ii), 'Prastot _ri_ , that deity which\nbelongs to the Prastava,' &c.; and further on, 'which then is that deity? He\nsaid--Breath. For all these beings merge into breath alone, and from breath\nthey arise. This is the deity belonging to the Prastava. If without knowing\nthat deity you had sung forth, your head would have fallen off.' Here the word\n'breath,' analogously to the word 'ether' denotes the highest Brahman, which\nis different from what is commonly called breath; we infer this from the fact\nthat special characteristics of Brahman, viz. the whole world's entering into\nand rising from it, are in that text referred to as well-known things. There\nindeed here arises a further doubt; for as it is a matter of observation that\nthe existence, activity, &c., of the whole aggregate of creatures depend on\nbreath, breath--in its ordinary acceptation--may be called the cause of the\nworld. This doubt is, however, disposed of by the consideration that breath is\nnot present in things such as stones and wood, nor in intelligence itself, and\nthat hence of breath in the ordinary sense it cannot be said that 'all beings\nenter into it,' &c. We therefore conclude that Brahman is here called 'breath'\nin so far as he bestows the breath of life on all beings. And the general\nresult of the discussion carried on in connexion with the last two Sutras thus\nis that the words 'ether' and 'breath' denote something other than what is\nordinarily denoted by those terms, viz. the highest Brahman, the sole cause of\nthis entire world, free from all evil, &c. &c.--Here terminates the adhikara\n_n_ a of 'breath.'\n\np. 247\n\nThe subsequent Sutras up to the end of the Pada demonstrate that the being\nwhich the texts refer to as 'Light or 'Indra'--terms which in ordinary\nlanguage are applied to certain other well-known beings--, and which is\nrepresented as possessing some one or other supremely exalted quality that is\ninvariably connected with world-creative power, is no other than the highest\nBrahman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 25.
