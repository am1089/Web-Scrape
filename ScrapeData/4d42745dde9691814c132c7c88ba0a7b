Prayer to Kama (love), personified as a primordial power.\n\n1\\. To the bull that slays the enemy, to Kama, do I render tribute with ghee,\noblation, and (sacrificial) melted butter. Do thou, since thou hast been\nextolled, hurl down my enemies by thy great might!  \n2\\. The evil dream which is offensive to my mind and eye, which harasses and\ndoes not please me, that (dream) do I let loose upon my enemy. Having praised\nKama may I prevail!  \n3,. Evil dreams, O Kama, and misfortune, O Kama, childlessness, ill-health,\nand trouble, do thou, a strong lord, let loose upon him that designs evil\nagainst us!  \n4\\. Drive them away, O Kama, thrust them away, O Kama; may they that are my\nenemies fall into trouble! When they have been driven into the nethermost\ndarkness, do thou, O Agni, burn up their d welling- places!  \n5\\. That milch-cow, O Kama, whom the sages call Vak Virag (ruling, or\nresplendent speech), is said to be thy daughter; by her drive away my enemies;\nbreath, cattle, and life shall give them a wide birth!  \n6\\. With the strength of Kama, Indra, king Varuna, and Vishnu, with the\nimpelling force (savena) of Savitar, with the priestly power of Agni, do I\ndrive forth the enemies, as a skilled steersman a boat.  \n7\\. My sturdy guardian, strong Kama, shall procure for me full freedom from\nenmity! May the gods collectively be my refuge, may all the gods respond to\nthis, my invocation!  \n8\\. Taking pleasure in this (sacrificial) melted butter, and ghee do ye, (O\ngods), of whom Kama is the highest, be joyful in this place, procuring for me\nfull freedom from enmity!  \n9\\. O Indra and Agni, and Kama, having formed an alliance, do ye hurl down my\nenemies; when they have fallen into the nethermost darkness, do thou, O Agni,\nburn up after them their dwelling places!  \n10\\. Slay thou, O Kama, those that are my enemies, hurl them down into blind\ndarkness. Devoid of vigour, Without sap let them all be; they shall not live a\nsingle day!  \n11\\. Kama has slain those that are my enemies, a broad space has he furnished\nme to thrive in. May the four directions of space bow down to me, and the six\nbroad (regions) carry ghee to me!  \n12\\. They (the enemies) shall float down like a boat cut loose from its\nmoorings! There is no returning again for those who have been struck by our\nmissiles.  \n13\\. Agni is a defence, Indra a defence, Soma a defence. May the gods, who by\ntheir defence ward off (the enemy), ward him off!  \n14\\. With his men reduced, driven out, the hated (enemy) shall go, shunned by\nhis own friends! And down upon the earth do the lightnings alight; may the\nstrong god crush your enemies!  \n15\\. This mighty lightning supports both moveable and immoveable things, as\nwell as all thunders. May the rising sun by his resources and his majesty hurl\ndown my enemies, lie the mighty one!  \n16\\. With that triple-armoured powerful covering of thine, O Kama, with the\ncharm that has been made into an Invulnerate armour spread (over thee), with\nthat do thou drive away those who are my enemies; may breath, cattle, and life\ngive them a wide berth!  \n17\\. With the weapon with which the god drove forth the Asuras, with which\nIndra led the Dasyus to the nethermost darkness, with that do thou, O Kama,\ndrive forth far away from this world those who are my enemies!  \n18\\. As the gods drove forth the Asuras, as Indra. forced the demons into the\nnethermost darkness, thus do thou, O Kama, drive forth far away from this\nworld those who are my enemies!  \n19\\. Kama was born at first; him neither the gods, nor the Fathers, nor men\nhave equalled. To these art thou superior, and ever great; to thee, O Kama, do\nI verily offer reverence.  \n20\\. As great as are the heavens and earth in extent, as far as the waters\nhave swept, as far as fire; to these art thou superior, &c.  \n21\\. Great as are the directions (of space) and the intermediate direction on\neither side, great as are the regions and the vistas of the sky; to these art\nthou superior, &c.  \n22\\. As many bees, bats, kururu-worms, as many vaghas and tree-serpents as\nthere are; to these art thou superior, &c.  \n23\\. Superior art thou to all that winks (lives), superior to all that stands\nstill (is not alive), superior to the ocean art thou, O Kama, Manyu! To these\nart thou superior, &c.  \n24\\. Not, surely, does the wind equal Kama, not the fire, not the sun, and not\nthe moon. To these art thou superior, &c.  \n25\\. With those auspicious and gracious forms of thine, O Kama, through which\nwhat thou wilst becometh reaL with these do thou enter into us, and elsewhere\nsend the evil thoughts!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIX, 53.
