We will explain the rule for the adoption of a son. 1\n\n2\\. Man, formed of virile seed and uterine blood, proceeds from his mother and\nfather (as an effect) from its cause. 2\n\n3\\. (Therefore) the father and the mother have power to give, to abandon, or\nto sell their (son).\n\n4\\. But let him not give nor receive (in adoption) an only son;\n\n5\\. For he (must remain) to continue the line of the ancestors.\n\n6\\. Let a woman neither give nor receive a son except with the permission of\nher husband.\n\n7\\. He who is desirous of adopting (a son) procures two garments, two\nearrings, and a finger-ring; a spiritual guide who has studied the whole Veda;\na layer of Ku _s_ a grass and fuel of Pala _s_ a wood and so forth. 7\n\np. 335\n\n8\\. Then he convenes his relations, informs the king (of his intention to\nadopt) in (their) presence, feeds the (invited) Brahma _n_ as in the assembly\nor in (his) dwelling, and makes them wish him 'an auspicious day,' 'hail,'\n(and) 'prosperity.' 8\n\n9\\. Then he performs the ceremonies which begin with the drawing of the lines\non the altar and end with the placing of the water-vessels, goes to the giver\n(of the child) and should address (this) request (to him), 'Give me (thy)\nson.'\n\n10\\. The other answers, 'I give (him).'\n\n11\\. He receives (the child with these words), 'I take thee for the fulfilment\nof (my) religious duties; I take thee to continue the line (of my ancestors).'\n\n12\\. Then he adorns him with the (above-mentioned) two garments, the two\nearrings, and the finger-ring, performs the rites which begin with the placing\nof the (pieces of wood called) paridhis (fences round the altar) and end with\nthe Agnimukha, and offers (a portion) of the cooked (food) in the fire. 12\n\n13\\. Having recited the Puronuvakya (verse), 'He who thinking of thee with a\ndiscerning mind,' &c., he offers an oblation, reciting the Ya _g_ ya (verse),\n'To which performer of good deeds, thou, O _G_ atavedas,' &c. 13\n\n14\\. Then he offers (oblations, reciting) the Vyah _ri_ tis;--(the ceremonies)\nwhich begin the oblation to Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t and end with the\npresentation 14\n\np. 336\n\nof a cow as a fee (to the officiating priest are) known;--\n\n15\\. And presents (to the spiritual guide) as a sacrificial fee those two\ndresses, those two earrings, and that finger-ring (with which he had adorned\nthe child).\n\n16\\. If after the performance of these (rites) a legitimate son of his own\nbody is born (to the adopter, then the adopted son) receives a fourth (of the\nlegitimate son's) share. Thus says Baudhayana. 16\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[334:1](sbe1491.htm#fr_1464) **5**. This chapter has been translated by Mr.\nSutherland, Dattaka Mima _m_ sa V, 42, and Dattaka _K_ andrika II, 16, and by\nmyself, journal Bengal Br. Roy. As. Soc., vol. XXXV, p.162.\n\n[334:2](sbe1491.htm#fr_1465)-6. Identical with Vasish _th_ a XV, 1-5. The best\nMS. omits the particle tu, 'but,' in Sutra 6, while others have it.\n\n[334:7](sbe1491.htm#fr_1466)-8. Vasish _th_ a XV, 7. The translation of madhye\nby 'in their presence' rests on the authority of the Sa _m_ skarakaustubha 47\nb, 11, where it is explained madhye [a] iti bandhusamaksham. The other\nexplanation 'in the middle (of his dwelling),' to which the interpolated text\nof the Dattaka Mima _m_ sa and Dattaka _K_ andrikra refers, is, however, also\npossible.\n\n[335:8](sbe1491.htm#fr_1467) The ceremony alluded to is the so-called pu _n_\nyahava _k_ anam.\n\n[335:12](sbe1491.htm#fr_1468) The correct reading is pakva _g_ _g_ uhoti.\n\n[335:13](sbe1491.htm#fr_1469) The two texts are found Taittiriya Sa _m_ hita\nI, 4, 46, I.\n\n[335:14](sbe1491.htm#fr_1470) Vasish _th_ a XV, 7.
