The cause explain:  \nWhy art thou come, and what to gain?'  \nAs S'urpanakha questioned so,  \nRama, the terror of the foe,  \nIn answer to the monster's call,  \nWith fearless candour told her all.  \n\n'King Das'aratha reigned of old,  \nLike Gods celestial brave and bold.  \nI am his eldest son and heir,  \nAnd Rama is the name I bear.  \nThis brother, Lakshman, younger born,  \nMost faithful love to me has sworn.  \nMy wife, this princess, dear to fame,  \nIs Sita the Videhan dame.  \nObedient to my sire's behest  \nAnd by the queen my mother pressed,  \nTo keep the law and merit win,  \nI sought this wood to harbour in.  \nBut speak, for I of thee in turn  \nThy name, and race, and sire would learn.  \nThou art of giant race, I ween.  \nChanging at will thy form and mien.  \nSpeak truly, and the cause declare  \nThat bids thee to these shades repair.'  \n   Thus Rama spoke: the demon heard,  \nAnd thus replied by passion spurred:  \n'Of giant race, what form soe'er  \nMy fancy wills, 'tis mine to wear.  \nNamed S'urpanakha here I stray,  \nAnd where I walk spread wild dismay.  \nKing Ravan is my brother: fame  \nHas taught perchance his dreaded name,  \nStrong Kumbhakama slumbering deep  \nIn chains of never-ending sleep:  \nVibhishan of the duteous mind.  \nIn needs unlike his giant kind:  \nDushan and Khara, brave and bold  \nWhose fame by every tongue is told:  \nTheir might by mine is far surpassed;  \nBut when, O best of men, I cast  \nThese fond eyes on thy form, I see  \nMy chosen love and lord in thee.  \nEndowed with wondrous might am I:  \nWhere'er my fancy leads I fly.  \nThe poor misshapen Sita leave,  \nAnd me, thy worthier bride receive.  \nLook on my beauty, and prefer  \nA spouse more meet than one like her:  \nI'll eat that ill-formed woman there:  \nThy brother too her fate shall share.  \nBut come, beloved, thou shalt roam  \nWith me through all our woodland home;  \nEach varied grove with me shalt seek,  \nAnd gaze upon each mountain peak.'  \n   As thus she spoke, the monster gazed  \nWith sparkling eyes where passion blazed:  \nThen he, in lore of language learned,  \nThis answer eloquent returned:  \n\n        * * * * *  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[249:1](ry214.htm#fr_455) The chief chamberlain and attendant of S'iva or\nRodra.\n\n[249:2](ry214.htm#fr_456) Uma or Parvati, the consort of S'iva.\n\n[250:1](ry215.htm#fr_457) A star, one of the favourites of the Moon.\n\n[250:2](ry215.htm#fr_458) The God of love.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XVIII.: The Mutilation.](ry216.htm)\n\n"
