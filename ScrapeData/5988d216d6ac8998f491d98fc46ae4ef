This is the truth. As from a blazing fire sparks, being like unto fire 1,\nfly forth a thousandfold, thus are various beings brought forth from the\nImperishable, my friend, and return thither also.\n\n2\\. That heavenly Person is without body, he is both without and within, not\nproduced, without breath and without mind, pure, higher than the high\nImperishable 2.\n\n3\\. From him (when entering on creation) is born breath, mind, and all organs\nof sense, ether, air, light, water, and the earth, the support of all.\n\n4\\. Fire (the sky) is his head, his eyes the sun and the moon, the quarters\nhis ears, his speech the Vedas disclosed, the wind his breath, his heart the\nuniverse; from his feet came the earth; he is indeed the inner Self of all\nthings 3.\n\n5\\. From him comes Agni (fire) 4, the sun being the fuel; from the moon (Soma)\ncomes rain (Par _g_ anya); from the earth herbs; and man gives seed unto the\nwoman. Thus many beings are begotten from the Person (purusha).\n\n6\\. From him come the _Ri_ _k_ , the Saman, the\n\np. 35\n\n[paragraph continues] Ya _g_ ush, the Diksha (initiatory rites), all\nsacrifices and offerings of animals, and the fees bestowed on priests, the\nyear too, the sacrificer, and the worlds, in which the moon shines brightly\nand the sun.\n\n7\\. From him the many Devas too are begotten, the Sadhyas (genii), men,\ncattle, birds, the up and down breathings, rice and corn (for sacrifices),\npenance, faith, truth, abstinence, and law.\n\n8\\. The seven senses (pra _n_ a) also spring from him, the seven lights (acts\nof sensation), the seven kinds of fuel (objects by which the senses are\nlighted), the seven sacrifices (results of sensation), these seven worlds (the\nplaces of the senses, the worlds determined by the senses) in which the senses\nmove, which rest in the cave (of the heart), and are placed there seven and\nseven.\n\n9\\. Hence come the seas and all the mountains, from him flow the rivers of\nevery kind; hence come all herbs and the juice through which the inner Self\nsubsists with the elements.\n\n10\\. The Person is all this, sacrifice, penance, Brahman, the highest\nimmortal; he who knows this hidden in the cave (of the heart), he, O friend,\nscatters the knot of ignorance here on earth.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[34:1](sbe15018.htm#fr_173) Cf.
