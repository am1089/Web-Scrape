Those deities (devata), Agni and the rest, after they had been sent forth,\nfell into this great ocean 1.\n\nThen he (the Self) besieged him, (the person) with hunger and thirst.\n\n2\\. The deities then (tormented by hunger and thirst) spoke to him (the Self):\n'Allow us a place in which we may rest and eat food 2.' (1)\n\nHe led a cow towards them (the deities). They said: 'This is not enough.' He\nled a horse towards them. They said: 'This is not enough.' (2)\n\nHe led man 3 towards them. Then they said: 'Well done 4, indeed.' Therefore\nman is well done.\n\n3\\. He said to them: 'Enter, each according to his place.' (3)\n\n4\\. Then Agni (fire), having become speech, entered the mouth.

The shrubs and trees, having become hairs, entered the skin. _K_\nandramas (the moon), having become mind, entered\n\np. 240\n\nthe heart. Death, having become down-breathing, entered the navel. The waters,\nhaving become seed, entered the generative organ. (4)\n\n5\\.
