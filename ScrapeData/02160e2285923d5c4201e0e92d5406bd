Either the consequence of the entire (Brahman undergoing change) has to\nbe accepted, or else a violation of the texts declaring Brahman to be without\nparts.\n\nHitherto we have established so much that Brahman, intelligent, one, without a\nsecond, modifying itself without the employment of any extraneous means, is\nthe cause of the world.--Now, another objection is raised for the purpose of\nthrowing additional light on the point under discussion.--The consequence of\nthe Vedanta doctrine, it is said, will be that we must assume the entire\nBrahman to undergo the change into its effects, because it is not composed of\nparts. If Brahman, like earth and other matter, consisted of parts, we might\nassume that a part of it undergoes the change, while the other part remains as\nit is. But Scripture distinctly declares Brahman to be devoid of parts.\nCompare, 'He who is without parts, without actions, tranquil, without fault,\nwithout taint' ( _Sv_ e. Up. VI, 19); 'That heavenly person is without body,\nhe is both without and within, not produced' (Mu. Up. II, 1, 2); 'That great\nBeing is endless, unlimited, consisting of nothing but knowledge' (B _ri_. Up.\nII, 4, 12); 'He is to be described by No, no' (B _ri_. Up. III, 9, 2,6); 'It\nis neither coarse nor fine' (B _ri_. Up. III, 8, 8); all which passages deny\nthe existence of any distinctions in Brahman.--As, therefore, a partial\nmodification is impossible, a modification of the entire Brahman has to be\nassumed. But that involves a cutting off of Brahman from its very basis.--\nAnother consequence of the Vedantic view is that the texts exhorting us to\nstrive 'to see' Brahman become purposeless; for the effects of Brahman may be\nseen without any endeavour, and apart from them no Brahman exists.--And,\nfinally, the texts declaring Brahman to be unborn are contradicted thereby.--\nIf, on the other hand--in order to escape from these difficulties--we assume\nBrahman to consist of parts, we thereby do violence to those texts which\ndeclare Brahman not to be made up of parts.\n\np. 350\n\nMoreover, if Brahman is made up of parts, it follows that it is non-eternal.--\nHence the Vedantic point of view cannot be maintained in any way.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1, 27](sbe34166.htm)\n\n"
