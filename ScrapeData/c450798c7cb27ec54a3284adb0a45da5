Verily, there are deaths 3 connected with all the worlds; and were\nhe not to offer oblations to them, Death would get hold of him in every world:\n\np. 340\n\nwhen he offers oblations to the Deaths 1, he wards off Death in every world.\n\n13:3:5:22\\. Concerning this they say, \'If, in offering, he were to name them\nall, saying, "To such 2 (a death) hail! To such (a death) hail!" he would make\nthat manifold death his enemy 3, and would give himself over to Death.\' Only\none oblation he offers to one of them, with, \'To Death, hail!\' for there is\nindeed but one Death in yonder world, even Hunger 4: it is him he wards off in\nyonder world.\n\n13:3:5:33\\. A second oblation he makes with, \'To Brahman-slaying, hail!\' for,\ndoubtless, a murder other than the slaying of a Brahman is no murder; but that\n--to wit, the slaying of a Brahman--is manifestly murder: he thus manifestly\nwards off Death 5.\n\np. 341\n\n13:3:5:44\\. Mu _n_ _d_ ibha Audanya 1 it was who discovered this atonement for\nthe slaying of a Brahman; and when one offers the oblation to the Brahmahatya\nhe prepares a remedy for the slayer of a Brahman by satisfying Death himself\nwith an oblation, and making a protection 2 for him (the slayer). At\nwhosoever\'s A _s_ vamedha, therefore, this oblation is offered, even if in\nafter-times 3 any one in his family kills a Brahman, he thereby prepares a\nremedy (expiation) for him.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[339:3](sbe44098.htm#fr_866) That is, according to Saya _n_ a, on Taitt. Br.\nIII, 9, 15, 1, causes of death, such as diseases, &c.\n\n[340:1](sbe44098.htm#fr_867) The oblations referred to in this Brahma _n_ a\n(\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1-4) occur towards the end of the second set of \'ara _n_ ye\xe0\xa4\xbdnu _k_ ya\'\noblations mentioned above, [p. 336](sbe44097.htm#page_336), note\n[2](sbe44097.htm#fn_856), where the formulas are given. According to Taitt.\nBr., l.c., however, these final oblations are to be performed--like that to\n_G_ umbaka (Varu _n_ a)--at the time of the purificatory bath, which, indeed,\nmay also be intended by our Brahma _n_ a, though Katyayana and Mahidhara seem\nto offer no indications to that effect. It is clear that these final oblations\nmust have formed the subject of considerable discussion among the early\nritualists.\n\n[340:2](sbe44098.htm#fr_868) That is, according to Saya _n_ a (Taitt. Br.),\n\'To death in the shape of disease, to death in the shape of poverty, &c.\'\nHarisvamin, on our passage, has merely, \'Amushmai pit _ri_ lokaya m _ri_\ntyave\'--\'To death (in the shape of) the world of the Fathers,\' which is not\nvery clear.\n\n[340:3](sbe44098.htm#fr_869) Or, perhaps, he would make himself many a death-\nenemy (bahu _m_ m _ri_ tyum amitra _m_ kurvita), the two nouns being taken as\nin apposition to each other; cf. [p. 146](sbe44049.htm#page_146), note\n[1](sbe44049.htm#fn_441).\n\n[340:4](sbe44098.htm#fr_870) See X, 6, 5, 1.\n\n[340:5](sbe44098.htm#fr_871) Or, he thus wards off what is manifestly Death\n(Death in person).\n\n[341:1](sbe44098.htm#fr_872) That is, according to Harisvamin, the son of\nUdanya (Odana. St. Petersb. Dict.), Taitt. Br. III, 9, 15, 3, has Mu _n_ _d_\nibha Audanyava (i.e. the son of Udanyu, Say.) instead. The Taitt. Br.,\nbesides, makes the crime to be expiated here to be, not \'brahmahatya,\' but\n\'bhru _n_ ahatya,\' the killing of an embryo. Saya _n_ a, however, there allows\nto \'bhru _n_ a\' optionally its later meaning of \'a Brahma _n_ a versed in the\nthree Vedas and the sacrificial art (kalpa),\' and the Taitt. Br. itself, at\nall events, takes this oblation to \'bhru _n_ ahatya\' to atone likewise for the\nslaying of a Brahma _n_ a.\n\n[341:2](sbe44098.htm#fr_873) Harisvamin explains \'paripa _n_ am\' by \'pari _s_\nish _t_ a _m_ vanantam panam\' (?); whilst Saya _n_ a, in Taitt. Br., takes it\nin the sense of \'sarvata _h_ patram,\' i.e. having made the Sacrificer \'a\nthoroughly worthy person.\'\n\n[341:3](sbe44098.htm#fr_874) Harisvamin here unwarrantably takes \'aparishu\' in\nthe sense of \'in past times.\'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 3, 6.
