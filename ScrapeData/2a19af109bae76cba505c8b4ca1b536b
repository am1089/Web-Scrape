And the weak\nman assents. But the lesson of the whole world is: "That is really mine which\nI can snatch away." My country does not become mine simply because it is the\ncountry of my birth. It becomes mine on the day when I am able to win it by\nforce.\n\nEvery man has a natural right to possess, and therefore greed is natural. It\nis not in the wisdom of nature that we should be content to be deprived. What\nmy mind covets, my surroundings must supply. This is the only true\nunderstanding between our inner and outer nature in this world. Let moral\nideals remain merely for those poor anaemic creatures of starved desire whose\ngrasp is weak. Those who can desire with all their soul and enjoy with all\ntheir heart, those who have no hesitation or scruple, it is they who are the\nanointed of Providence. Nature spreads out her riches and loveliest treasures\nfor their benefit. They swim across streams, leap over walls, kick open doors,\nto help themselves to whatever is worth taking. In such a getting one can\nrejoice; such wresting as this gives value to the thing taken.\n\nNature surrenders herself, but only to the robber. For she delights in this\nforceful desire, this forceful abduction. And so she does not put the garland\nof her acceptance round the lean, scraggy neck of the ascetic. The music of\nthe wedding march is struck. The time of the wedding I must not let pass. My\nheart therefore is eager. For, who is the bridegroom? It is I. The\nbridegroom\'s place belongs to him who, torch in hand, can come in time. The\nbridegroom in Nature\'s wedding hall comes unexpected and uninvited.\n\nAshamed? No, I am never ashamed! I ask for whatever I want, and I do not\nalways wait to ask before I take it. Those who are deprived by their own\ndiffidence dignify their privation by the name of modesty. The world into\nwhich we are born is the world of reality. When a man goes away from the\nmarket of real things with empty hands and empty stomach, merely filling his\nbag with big sounding words, I wonder why he ever came into this hard world at\nall. Did these men get their appointment from the epicures of the religious\nworld, to play set tunes on sweet, pious texts in that pleasure garden where\nblossom airy nothings? I neither affect those tunes nor do I find any\nsustenance in those blossoms.\n\nWhat I desire, I desire positively, superlatively. I want to knead it with\nboth my hands and both my feet; I want to smear it all over my body; I want to\ngorge myself with it to the full. The scrannel pipes of those who have worn\nthemselves out by their moral fastings, till they have become flat and pale\nlike starved vermin infesting a long-deserted bed, will never reach my ear.\n\nI would conceal nothing, because that would be cowardly. But if I cannot bring\nmyself to conceal when concealment is needful, that also is cowardly. Because\nyou have your greed, you build your walls. Because I have my greed, I break\nthrough them. You use your power: I use my craft. These are the realities of\nlife. On these depend kingdoms and empires and all the great enterprises of\nmen.\n\nAs for those _avatars_ who come down from their paradise to talk to us in some\nholy jargon--their words are not real. Therefore, in spite of all the applause\nthey get, these sayings of theirs only find a place in the hiding corners of\nthe weak. They are despised by those who are strong, the rulers of the world.\nThose who have had the courage to see this have won success, while those poor\nwretches who are dragged one way by nature and the other way by these avatars,\nthey set one foot in the boat of the real and the other in the boat of the\nunreal, and thus are in a pitiable plight, able neither to advance nor to keep\ntheir place.\n\nThere are many men who seem to have been born only with an obsession to die.\nPossibly there is a beauty, like that of a sunset, in this lingering death in\nlife which seems to fascinate them. Nikhil lives this kind of life, if life it\nmay be called. Years ago, I had a great argument with him on this point.\n\n"It is true," he said, "that you cannot get anything except by force. But then\nwhat is this force? And then also, what is this getting? The strength I\nbelieve in is the strength of renouncing."\n\n"So you," I exclaimed, "are infatuated with the glory of bankruptcy."\n\n"Just as desperately as the chick is infatuated about the bankruptcy of its\nshell," he replied. "The shell is real enough, yet it is given up in exchange\nfor intangible light and air. A sorry exchange, I suppose you would call it?"\n\nWhen once Nikhil gets on to metaphor, there is no hope of making him see that\nhe is merely dealing with words, not with realities. Well, well, let him be\nhappy with his metaphors. We are the flesh-eaters of the world; we have teeth\nand nails; we pursue and grab and tear. We are not satisfied with chewing in\nthe evening the cud of the grass we have eaten in the morning. Anyhow, we\ncannot allow your metaphor-mongers to bar the door to our sustenance. In that\ncase we shall simply steal or rob, for we must live.\n\nPeople will say that I am starting some novel theory just because those who\nare moving in this world are in the habit of talking differently though they\nare really acting up to it all the time. Therefore they fail to understand, as\nI do, that this is the only working moral principle. In point of fact, I know\nthat my idea is not an empty theory at all, for it has been proved in\npractical life. I have found that my way always wins over the hearts of women,\nwho are creatures of this world of reality and do not roam about in cloud-\nland, as men do, in idea-filled balloons.\n\nWomen find in my features, my manner, my gait, my speech, a masterful passion\n--not a passion dried thin with the heat of asceticism, not a passion with its\nface turned back at every step in doubt and debate, but a full-blooded\npassion. It roars and rolls on, like a flood, with the cry: "I want, I want, I\nwant." Women feel, in their own heart of hearts, that this indomitable passion\nis the lifeblood of the world, acknowledging no law but itself, and therefore\nvictorious. For this reason they have so often abandoned themselves to be\nswept away on the flood-tide of my passion, recking naught as to whether it\ntakes them to life or to death. This power which wins these women is the power\nof mighty men, the power which wins the world of reality.\n\nThose who imagine the greater desirability of another world merely shift their\ndesires from the earth to the skies. It remains to be seen how high their\ngushing fountain will play, and for how long. But this much is certain: women\nwere not created for these pale creatures--these lotus-eaters of idealism.\n\n"Affinity!" When it suited my need, I have often said that God has created\nspecial pairs of men and women, and that the union of such is the only\nlegitimate union, higher than all unions made by law. The reason of it is,\nthat though man wants to follow nature, he can find no pleasure in it unless\nhe screens himself with some phrase--and that is why this world is so\noverflowing with lies.\n\n"Affinity!" Why should there be only one? There may be affinity with\nthousands. It was never in my agreement with nature that I should overlook all\nmy innumerable affinities for the sake of only one. I have discovered many in\nmy own life up to now, yet that has not closed the door to one more--and that\none is clearly visible to my eyes. She has also discovered her own affinity to\nme.\n\nAnd then?\n\nThen, if I do not win I am a coward.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI](hw09.htm)\n\n'
