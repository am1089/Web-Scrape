 \nSee near Prayag  1b that smoke arise:  \nThe banner of our Lord of Flames  \nThe dwelling of some saint proclaims.  \nNear to the place our steps we bend  \nWhere Yamuna and Ganga blend.  \nI hear and mark the deafening roar  \nWhen chafing floods together pour.  \nSee, near us on the ground are left  \nDry logs, by labouring woodmen cleft,  \nAnd the tall trees, that blossom near  \nSaint Bharadvaja's home, appear.'  \n\nThe bow-armed princes onward passed,  \nAnd as the sun was sinking fast  \nThey reached the hermit's dwelling, set  \nNear where the rushing waters met.  \nThe presence of the warrior scared  \nThe deer and birds as on he fared,  \nAnd struck them vith unwonted awe:  \nThen Bharadvaja's cot they saw.  \nThe high-souled hermit soon they found  \nGirt by his dear disciples round:  \nCalm saint, whose vows had well been wrought,  \nWhose fervent rites keen sight had bought.  \nDuly had flames of worship blazed  \nWhen Rama on the hermit gazed:  \nHis suppliant hands the hero raised,  \nDrew nearer to the holy man  \nWith his companions, and began,  \nDeclaring both his name and race  \nAnd why they sought that distant place;  \n'Saint, Das'aratha's children we,  \nRama and Lakshman, come to thee.  \nThis my good wife from Janak springs.  \nThe best of fair Videha's kings;  \nThrough lonely wilds, a faultless dame,  \nTo this pure grove with me she came.  \nMy younger brother follows still  \nMe banished by my father's will:  \nSumitra's son, bound by a vow,--  \nHe roams the wood beside me now.  \nSent by my father forth to rove,  \nWe seek, O Saint, some holy grove,  \nWhere lives of hermits we may lead,  \nAnd upon fruits and berries feed.'  \n\nWhen Bharadvaja, prudent-souled,  \nHad heard the prince his tale unfold,  \nWater he bade them bring, a bull,  \nAnd honour-gifts in dishes full,  \n\np. 159  \n\nAnd drink and food of varied taste,  \nBerries and roots, before him placed,  \nAnd then the great ascetic showed  \nA cottage for the guests' abode.  \nThe saint these honours gladly paid  \nTo Rama who had thither strayed,  \nThen compassed sat by birds and deer  \nAnd many a hermit resting near.  \nThe prince received the service kind,  \nAnd sat him down rejoiced in mind.  \nThen Bharadvaja silence broke,  \nAnd thus the words of duty spoke:  \n'Kakutstha's royal son, that thou  \nHadst sought this grove I knew ere now.  \nMine ears have heard thy story, sent  \nWithout a sin to banishment.  \nBehold, O Prince, this ample space  \nNear where the mingling floods embrace,  \nHoly, and beautiful, and clear:  \nDwell with us, and be happy here.'  \n\nBy Bharadvaja thus addressed,  \nRama whose kind and tender breast  \nAll living things would bless and save,  \nIn gracious words his answer gave:  \n\n'My honoured lord, this tranquil spot,  \nFair home of hermits, suits me not:  \nFor all the neighbouring people here  \nWill seek us when they know me near:  \nWith eager wish to look on me,  \nAnd the Videhan dame to see,  \nA crowd of rustics will intrude  \nUpon the holy solitude.  \nProvide, O gracious lord, I pray,  \nSome quiet home that lies away,  \nWhere my Videhan spouse may dwell  \nTasting the bliss deserved so well.'  \n\nThe hermit heard the prayer he made:  \nA while in earnest thought he stayed.  \nAnd then in words like these expressed  \nHis answer to the chief's request:  \n'Ten leagues away there stands a hill  \nWhere thou mayvst live, if such thy will:  \nA holy mount, exceeding fair;  \nGreat saints have made their dwelling there:  \nThere great Langurs  1 in thousands play,  \nAnd bears amid the thickets stray;  \nWide-known by Chitrakuta's name,  \nIt rivals Gandhamadan's  2 fame.  \nLong as the man that hill who seeks  \nGazes upon its sacred peaks,  \nTo holy things his soul he gives  \nAnd pure from thought of evil lives.  \nThere, while a hundred autumns fled,  \nHas many a saint with hoary head  \nSpent his pure life, and won the prize,  \nBy deep devotion, in the skies:  \n\nBest home, I ween, if such retreat,  \nFar from the ways of men, be sweet:  \nOr let thy yewre of exile flee  \nHere in this hermitage with me.'  \n\nThus Bharadvaja spake, and trained  \nIn lore of duty, entertained  \nThe princes and the dame, and pressed  \nHie friendly gifts on every guest.  \n\nThus to Prayag the hero went,  \nThus saw the saint preeminent,  \nAnd varied speeches heard and said:  \nThen holy night o'er heaven was spread.  \nAnd Rama took, by toil oppressed,  \nWith Sita and his brother, rest;  \nAnd so the night, with sweet content,  \nIn Bharadvaja's grove was spent.  \nBut when the dawn dispelled the night,  \nRama approached the anchorite,  \nAnd thus addressed the holy sire  \nWhose glory shone like kindled fire:  \n'Well have we spent, O truthful Sage,  \nThe night within thy hermitage:  \nNow let my lord his guests permit  \nFor their new home his grove to quit.'  \n\nThen, as he saw the morning break,  \nIh answer Bharadvaja spake:  \n'Go forth to Chitrakuta's hill,  \nWhere berries grow, and sweets distil:  \nFull well, I deem, that home will suit  \nThee, Rama, strong and resolute.  \nGo forth, and Chitrakuta seek,  \nFamed mountain of the Varied Peak.  \nIn the wild woods that gird him round  \nAll creatures of the chase are found:  \nThou in the glades shalt see appear  \nVast herds of elephants and deer.  \nWith Si'ta there shalt thou delight  \nTo gaze upon the woody height;  \nThere with expanding heart to look  \nOn river, table-land, and brook,  \nAnd see the foaming torrent rave  \nImpetuous from the mountain cave.  \nAuspicious hill! where all day long  \nThe lapwing's cry, the Koil's song  \nMake all who listen gay:  \nWhere all is fresh and fair to see,  \nWhere elephants and deer roam free,  \nThere, as a hermit, stay.'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[158:1](ry132.htm#fr_326) The Jumna.\n\n[158:1b](ry132.htm#fr_327) The Hindu name of Allahabad.\n\n[159:1](ry132.htm#fr_328) The Langur is a large monkey.\n\n[159:2](ry132.htm#fr_329) A mountain said to lie to the east of Meru.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LV.: The Passage of Yamuna.](ry133.htm)\n\n"
