The Himalayas said:--"O Devi! O Mahes\'vari! O Thou, the Ocean of Mercy! O\nWorld-Mother! Now describe in detail how Thy worship is conducted, the rules\nand ceremonials thereof.\n\n2-20. The Devi said:--"O King of Mountains! I now describe to you the rites\nand ceremonies and the methods of My worship that are pleasing to Me. Hear it\nattentively and with fai th. My worship in of two kinds:--External and\ninternal. The external worship is again twofold: one is Vaidik, and the other\nis Tantrik. The Vaidik worship is also of two kinds according to the\ndifferences in My forms. Those who are initiated in the Vedic Mantrams worship\naccording to the Vedic rites and ceremonies and those who are initiated in the\nTantrik-Mantram worship; according to the Tantrik rites. That stupid man is\nentirely ruined and goes to Hell who knowing the secrets of worship, act\ncontrary to them. First I will describe to you the Vaidik worship; hear. The\nhighest Form of Mine that you saw before, with innumerable heads, innumerable\neyes, innumerable feet, and the Illuminer of the intelligenees of all the\nJivas, endowed with all powers, Higher than the Highest, Very Grand, worship\nThat, bow down to That and meditate on That. O Nagendra! This is the first\nform of worship that I describe to you. With your senses controlled, peaceful,\nwith a well concentrated mind, void of egoism and vanity, and devoted to That,\nperform sacrifices to That,, take refuge of That, see That within the temple\nof your mind, and always recite\n\np. 735\n\nHer name and meditate on that. Take hold of Me, and My ideas with one pointed\nloving devotion and please Me with the performance of sacrifices, austerities\nand gifts. By My Grace, you will no doubt be able to get the Final Liberation.\nWhoever is entirely attached to Me, thinking Me as the Highest, is the\nforemost amongst the Bhaktas. I promise that I will certainly deliver him from\nthis ocean of the world. O King of mountains! Meditation with Karma and J\xc3\xb1ana\nwith Bhakti will lead one to Me. Only the work alone will fail to get one to\nMe. O Himavan! From Dharma arises Bhakti and from Bhakti arises the Highest\nJ\xc3\xb1ana. What are said in the S\'ruti and Smriti S\'astras the Mahar _s_ is take\nthat as the Dharma; and what are written in other S\'astras, they take them to\nbe Dharmabhasa (the Shadow or reflection of Dharma). Out of My omniscient and\nomnipotent Nature, the Vedas have come. Owing to the want of Ignorance in Me,\nthe Vedas can never be invalidated. The Smritis are formed out of the meaning\nof the Vedas; so the Smritii and Pura _n_ as, formed, by Manu and the other\n_R_ i _s_ is, are authoritative. In some places it is hinted that there other\nS\'astras than the Vedas, taking the Tantras indirectly into account. Although\nthe matters relating to the Dharmas are mentioned therein, but as they are\napparently contrary to the S\'rutis, the Tantras are not accepted by the Vaidik\nPundits. The other S\'astra makers are marked with their ignorance; so their\nsayings cannot be authoritative. Therefore he must resort entirely to the\nVedas who want the final liberation. As the king\'s order is never disobeyed\namongst his subjects, so the S\'ruti, the Command of Mine, the Lord of all, can\nnever be abandoned by men.\n\n21-30. To preserve My Commandments, I have created the Brahma _n_ a and the K\n_s_ attriya castes. My secrets are all embodied in the S\'rutis. For that\nreason, the words of the S\'rutis are no doubt to be known and observed by the\nsages. O Mountain! When the Dharma (righteousness) declines and the Adharma\n(unrighteousness) reigns supreme, I then manifest Myself in the world as\nSakambhari, Rama, Kri _sn_ a and others. Therefore, the Devas, the preservers\nof the Vedas, and the Daityas, the destroyers of the Vedas are classified.\nWhoever does not practise according to the Vedas I have created many hells for\ntheir lessons. When the sinners hear of those hells, they get extremely\nterrified. The king should banish those stupid persons from his kingdom and\nthe Brahmi _n_ s should not talk with them nor take them in their own lines\nnor when partaking of food, those who forsake the Vaidic Dharma and go for\nshelter to another Dharma. The S\'astras that are extant, as contrary to the\nS\'rutis and Smritis, are all Tamasa S\'astras, Mahadeva has framed these Vama,\nKapalak, Kaulaks, Bhairava and such like S\'astras for fascinating the\n\np. 736\n\npeople; else he has no object in framing thein. Those Branma _n_ s that were\nburnt up by the curses of Dak _s_ a, S\'ukra, Dadhichi and were banished from\nthe path of the Vedas, it is for delivering them, step by step that Mahadeva\nhas framed the five \xc3\x82gamas, S\'aiva, Vai _sn_ ava, S\'aura, S\'atta and Ganapatya\nS\'astras.\n\n31-37. In those Tantra S\'astras, there are some passages in conformity with\nthe Vedas and there are other passages contradictory to the Vedas. If the\nVaidik persons resort to passages in conformity with the Veda, then there\ncannot arise any fault in them. The Brahmi _n_ s are not Adhikaris to those\nTantric texts that are contradictory to the Vedas. Those persons that have no\nclaim to the Vedas can be Adhikaris to these latter texts. Therefore the\nVaidik Brahma _n_ as should resort to the Vedas with all the care possible and\nmake the Para Brahma ot the nature of J\xc3\xb1ana manifest within them. The Sa _n_\nynsins, Vanaprasthas, householders and Brahmacharis should give up all their\ndesires and take refuge in Me; free from egoism and vanity, kind to all\ncreatures, their hearts wholly given to Me and engaged in speaking out My\nplaces with enrapt devotion. They always worship My Virat (Cosmic) form,\nimmersed in the Yoga called Ais\'varya Yoga (Cosmic Yoga dealing with the\nglories, prosperity of god). Illumine the understanding with the Sun of My\nConsciousness, and I destroy the Darkness of Ignorance of those persons that\nare always engaged in practising Yoga with Me. There is no doubt in this. O\nNagendra! Thus I have described in brief the methods and practises of the\nVaidik Puja; now I will tell you the Tantriki Puja; hear attentively.\n\n38-47, On an image, or clean plot of ground, or on the Sun or the Moon, in\nwater, in Vana Linga, in Yantra or on a cloth or in the lotus of heart, one is\nto meditate and worship the Blissful, Higher than the Highest, the Devi, Who\ncreates this universe with the three Gu _n_ as Sattva, Raja and Tama, Who is\nfilled with the juice of mercy, Who is blooming in youth, Whose colour is red\nlike the rising Sun, Whose beauty overtops to the full, Whose all the limbs\nare exquisitely beautiful, Who is the sentiment of Love Incarnate, Who feels\nvery much for the mental pain of Her Bhaktas on Who being pleased, manifests\nHerself before the Bhaktas on Whose forehead, the segment of the Moon shines\nincessantly, and Whose four hands hold goad, noose and the signs of\nfearlessness and to grant boons. Until one is entitlad to the internal\nworship, one should worship the external; never he is to abandon it. Worship\nis internal when ones, heart gets diluted in Para Brahma, of the nature of the\nUniversal Consciousness, O Mountain! Know My Consciousness (Samvit) to\n\np. 787\n\nbe My Highest Nature without any limitations. Therefore it is highly incumbent\nto attach one\'s hearts, free from other adjuncts, constantly to this Samvit.\nAnd what is more than this Samvit is this illusive world full of Maya. So to\nget rid of this world one is to constantly meditate on Me, the Witness of all,\nthe Self of all, with a heart full of devotiou and free from any Sankalaps or\ndesires.\n\nO Best of Mountains! Now I will describe to you in detail the external form of\nworship. Hear attentively.\n\nHere ends the Thirty-ninth Chapter of tho Seventh Book on the worship of the\nWorld Mother in S\'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, the Maha Pura _n_ am, of 18,000\nverses, by Mahrsi Veda Vyasa.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XL: The External Worship of the Devi](dg10.htm)\n\n'
