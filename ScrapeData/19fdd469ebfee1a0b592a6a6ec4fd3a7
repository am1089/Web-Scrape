'Bhaga has seized thy hand, Savitar has seized thy hand, Pushan has\nseized thy hand, Aryaman has seized thy hand. Mitra art thou by right, Agni is\nthy teacher, and I, N.N., both of us. Agni, I give this student in charge to\nthee. Indra, I give this student in charge to thee. Sun, I give this student\nin charge to thee. Vi _s_ ve devas, I give this student in charge to you, for\nthe sake of long life, of blessed offspring and strength, of increase of\nwealth, of mastership of all Vedas, of renown, of bliss.'\n\n2 2. 'In Indra's course I move; in the sun's course I move after him'\xc2\x97with\nthese words he turns round from left to right,\n\n3\\. And grasping down with the span of his right hand over (the student's)\nright shoulder he touches the place of his heart with the words, 'May I be\ndear to thy inviolate heart.'\n\np. 65\n\n4\\. Having silently turned round from right to left,\n\n5 5. And then laying his hand with the fingers upwards on his (i.e. the\nstudent's) heart, he murmurs:\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[64:1](sbe29033.htm#fr_132) 3\\. 1. T. Naraya _n_ a: 'Instead of asau (N.N.) he\nputs the name of the student in the vocative case.' I think rather that the\nteacher here pronounced his own name. Comp. asav aha _m_ bho, chap. 2, 5, &c.,\nand the Mantra in Paraskara II, 2, 20.\n\nThe text of the Mantra shows that the \xc3\x82 _k_ arya here seizes the hand of the\nBrahma _k_ arin; comp. \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana I, 20, 4-6, where it is stated that he\nseizes the student's hand together with the thumb, quite in the way prescribed\nfor the wedding at _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh. I, 13, 2. Comp. also Paraskara II, 2, 1 7. Naraya\n_n_ a: ma _n_ avakasya g _ri_ hitasa _m_ pu _t_ a eva _k_ aryo Bhagas ta ima\n_m_ mantra _m_ _g_ apan, &c.\n\n[64:2](sbe29033.htm#fr_133) Literally, 'he turns round, following his right\narm.' Naraya _n_ a here has the following note, '\xc3\x82 _k_ aryo ba _t_ or dakshi\n_n_ a _m_ bahu _m_ hasta _m_ aindrim av _ri_ tam iti mantre _n_ anvavartayet.\nayam artha _h_ , a _k_ arya ima _m_ mantra _m_ _g_ aptva ta _m_ ba _t_ u _m_\n_k_ a va _k_ ayitva pradakshi _n_ avarta _m_ karayet.' I believe that the\ncommentator here, as he frequently does, instead of interpreting the text of\n_S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana, fathers p. 65 on him statements belonging to other Sutras, in\nthis case probably to \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana I, 20, 9. As our text has not anvavartya\nbut anvav _ri_ tya; and in the Mantra not avartasva but avarte, we must\nconclude that he turned round himself, and, as far as the statements of the\ntext go, did not cause the pupil to do so.\n\n[65:5](sbe29033.htm#fr_134) The gesture is the same as that prescribed in the\nParaskara-G _ri_ hya I, 8, 8 to the bridegroom at the wedding; the Mantra\nthere is identical with _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh. II, 4, 1, the only difference consisting in\nthe name of the god who is invoked to unite the two: at the wedding this is\nPra _g_ apati, of course, because he is 'lord of offspring,' at the Upanayana,\nB _ri_ haspati, the Brahman \xce\xba\xce\xb1\xcf\x84\xe1\xbe\xbd \xce\xb5\xce\xbe\xce\xbf\xcf\x87\xce\xae\xce\xbd among the gods. It is very natural\nthat at the Upanayana and at the Vivaha, which both are destined to establish\nan intimate union between two persons hitherto strangers to each other, a\nnumber of identical rites should occur, for instance, the seizing of the hand;\nsee the note on Sutra 1.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 4](sbe29034.htm)\n\n"
