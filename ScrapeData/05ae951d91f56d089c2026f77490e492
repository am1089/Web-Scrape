Those (elements, &c.) (are merged) in the highest Brahman; for thus\n(scripture) says.\n\nThose, i.e. the sense organs--denoted by the term 'pra _n_ a'--and the\nelements of him who knows the highest Brahman, are merged in that same highest\nBrahman.--Why?--Because scripture declares that 'Thus these sixteen parts of\nthe spectator that go towards the person, when they have reached the person,\nsink into him' (Pr. Up. VI, 5).--But another text which refers to him who\nknows teaches that the parts also are merged in something different from the\nhighest Self, 'The fifteen parts enter into their elements' (Mu. Up. III, 2,\n7).--No, we reply. This latter passage is concerned with the ordinary view of\nthe matter, according to which the parts of the body which consist of earth\nand so on are merged in their causal substances, earth and so on. The former\npassage, on the other hand, expresses the view of him who knows; according to\nwhich the whole aggregate of the parts of him who knows the highest Brahman is\nmerged in Brahman only.--There is thus no contradiction.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 2, 16](sbe38296.htm)\n\n"
