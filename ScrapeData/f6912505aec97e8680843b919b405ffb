Different modes of marrying.\n\nSAGARA then addressed Aurva, and said, "You have described to me, venerable\nBrahman, the duties of the four orders and of the four castes. I am now\ndesirous to hear from you the religious institutes which men should\nindividually observe, whether they be invariable, occasional, or voluntary.\nDescribe these to me; for all things are known, chief of Bhrigu\'s race, unto\nyou." To this Aurva replied, "I will communicate to you, oh king, that which\nyou have asked, the invariable and occasional rites which men should perform:\ndo you attend.\n\n"When a son is born, let his father perform for him the ceremonies proper on\nthe birth of a child, and all other initiatory rites, as well as a \xc5\x9araddha,\nwhich is a source of prosperity. Let him feed a couple of Brahmans, seated\nwith their faces to the east; and according to his means offer sacrifices to\nthe gods and progenitors. Let him present to the manes 1 balls of meat mixed\nwith curds, barley, and jujubes, with the part of his hand sacred to the gods,\nor with that sacred to Prajapati 2. Let a Brahman perform such a \xc5\x9araddha, with\nall its offerings and circumambulations, on every occasion of good fortune 3.\n\n"Next, upon the tenth day after birth, let the father give a name to his\nchild; the first term of which shall be the appellation of a god, the second\nof a man, as \xc5\x9aarman or Varman; the former being the appropriate designation of\na Brahman, the latter of a warrior; whilst Gupta\n\np. 298\n\nand Dasa are best fitted for the names of Vai\xc5\x9byas and \xc5\x9audras 4. A name should\nnot be void of meaning; it should not be indecent, nor absurd, nor ill-omened,\nnor fearful; it should consist of an even number of syllables; it should not\nbe too long nor too short, nor too full of long vowels; but contain a due\nproportion of short vowels, and be easily articulated. After this and the\nsucceeding initiatory rites 5, the purified youth is to acquire religious\nknowledge, in the mode that has been described, in the dwelling of his\nspiritual guide.\n\n"When he has finished his studies, and given the parting donation to his\npreceptor, the man who wishes to lead the life of a householder must take a\nwife. If he does not propose to enter into the married state, he may remain as\na student with his teacher, first making a vow to that effect, and employ\nhimself in the service of his preceptor and of that preceptor\'s descendants;\nor he may at once become a hermit, or adopt the order of the religious\nmendicant, according to his original determination 6.\n\n"If he marry, he must select a maiden who is of a third of his age 7; one who\nhas not too much hair, but is not without any; one who is not\n\np. 299\n\nvery black nor yellow complexioned, and who is not from birth a cripple or\ndeformed. He must not marry a girl who is vicious or unhealthy, of low origin,\nor labouring under disease; one who has been ill brought up; one who talks\nimproperly; one who inherits some malady from father or mother; one who has a\nbeard, or who is of a masculine appearance; one who speaks thick or thin, or\ncroaks like a raven; one who keeps her eyes shut, or has the eyes very\nprominent; one who has hairy legs, or thick ancles; or one who has dimples in\nher cheeks when she laughs 8. Let not a wise and prudent man marry a girl of\nsuch a description: nor let a considerate man wed a girl of a harsh skin; or\none with white nails; or one with red eyes, or with very fat hands and feet;\nor one who is a dwarf, or who is very tall; or one whose eyebrows meet, or\nwhose teeth are far apart, and resemble tusks. Let a householder marry a\nmaiden who is in kin at least five degrees remote from his mother, and seven\nfrom his father, with the ceremonies enjoined by law 9.\n\n"The forms of marriage are eight, the Brahma, Daiva, the \xc3\x81rsha, Prajapatya,\nAsura, Gandharba, Rakshasa, and Pai\xc5\x9bacha; which last is the worst 10: but the\ncaste to which either form has been enjoined as lawful by inspired sages\nshould avoid any other mode of taking a wife. The householder who espouses a\nfemale connected with him by similarity of religious and civil obligations,\nand along with her discharges the duties of his condition, derives from such a\nwife great benefits."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[297:1](vp084.htm#fr_828) To the Nandimukhas. The Pitris, or progenitors, are\nso termed here from words occurring in the prayer used on the occasion of a\nfestive \xc5\x9araddha. As. Res. VII. 270.\n\n[297:2](vp084.htm#fr_829) With the Daiva tirtha, the tips of the fingers; or\nwith the Prajapatya tirtha, the part of the hand at the root of the little\nfinger. Manu, II. 58, 59. The second is called by Manu the Kaya tirtha, from\nKa, a synonyme of Prajapati.\n\n[297:3](vp084.htm#fr_830) The \xc5\x9araddha is commonly an obsequial or funeral\nsacrifice, but it implies offerings to the progenitors of an individual and of\nmankind, and always forms part of a religious ceremony on an occasion of\nrejoicing or an accession of prosperity, this being termed the Abhyudaya or\nVriddhi \xc5\x9araddha. As. Res. VII. 270.\n\n[298:4](vp084.htm#fr_831) So Manu, II. 30, 31, 32. The examples given in the\ncomment are, Soma\xc5\x9barman, Indravarman, Chandragupta, and \xc5\x9aivadasa, respectively\nappropriate appellations of men of the four castes.\n\n[298:5](vp084.htm#fr_832) Or Sanskaras; initiatory ceremonies, purificatory of\nthe individual at various stages.\n\n[298:6](vp084.htm#fr_833) Or the vow or pledge he has taken, that he will\nfollow for life the observances of the student or ascetic; both of which are\nenumerated in the Nirn\xcc\x81aya Sindhu, as acts prohibited in the Kali age; a man\nis not to continue a student or Brahmachari, i. e. a caenobite, for life; nor\nis he to become a mendicant without previously passing through the order of\nhouseholder. In practice, however, the prohibition is not unfrequently\ndisregarded.\n\n[298:7](vp084.htm#fr_834) By this is to be understood, according to the\ncommentator, merely a young girl, but at the same time one not immature; for\notherwise, he observes, a man of thirty, by which age he completes his sacred\nstudies, would espouse a girl of but ten years of age. According to Manu,\nhowever, the period of religious study does not terminate until thirty-six;\nand in the East a girl of twelve would be marriageable. The text of\nYajnawalkya has merely the word Yaviyasi, \'a very young woman.\' It is worthy\nof remark here, that neither that text, nor the text of Manu, nor the\ninterpretation of our text, authorizes the present practice of the nuptials of\nchildren. The obligation imposed upon a man of a life of perfect continence\nuntil he is more than thirty is singularly Malthusian.\n\n[299:8](vp084.htm#fr_835) For the credit of Hindu taste it is to be noticed\nthat the commentator observes the hemistich in which this last clause occurs\nis not found in all copies of the text.\n\n[299:9](vp084.htm#fr_836) See Manu, III. 5, &c.\n\n[299:10](vp084.htm#fr_837) These different modes of marriage a described by\nManu, III. 27, &c.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XI](vp085.htm)\n\n'
