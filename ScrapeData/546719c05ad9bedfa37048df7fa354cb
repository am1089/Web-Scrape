The lights in the village at its foot\nhad been extinguished, and the hill with its great length stood dark and\nisolated against the sky. Almost directly above the black cleft of the Cow\'s\nMouth stood the Tower of Victory of Kumbha Rana, like a finger pointing\nupwards in witness of past glory. And even in the darkness we could see the\ngentle curving lines of the walls following the contour of hillside, with its\nthree miles of length and one of breadth. Silently we sat on a low stone a\nmile off and drank in the scene. Even thus, on the first or last night of his\njourney, may some Rajput of old have gazed hour after hour on this beloved\nhome. Even thus may Padmini have caught her first glimpse of this city of her\nfate I\n\nIt is not a connected story, this for which Chitore is famous. The wild\nromance of which her annals are so full is a series of gleams and flashes,\nlasting through hundreds of years. Like\n\np. 102\n\nwatching from the plain the escalade of some rocky summit is the effort of one\nwho strives to picture the past of Chitore. Again and again do the banners of\nthe clansmen appear amidst trees and crags, only again and again to be lost to\nsight. Wherever the mists of history lift, there are revealed the old-time\nideals of the courage and pride of woman and the glory of man. Chitore is no\nmere chronological record; she is an eternal symbol, the heart\'s heart of one\nphase of the Indian genius.\n\nArchitecturally the splendour of the city justifies her pride. The rock on\nwhich she stands slopes inwards from all sides, with the result that there are\ninnumerable tanks and a water supply practically unlimited. Within the walls\nare the remains of what has been virtually two cities, one to the north-east,\nthe ancient capital of the time before Bappa Raoul, and one more modern which\ngrew up between his accession in A.D. 728 and the evacuation under Akbar in\n1568.\n\nThe old manor-grange, on whose veranda Bappa Raoul, in the eighth century,\nadministered justice, scarcely comports with our modern notions of a palace.\nIn front of it, not far away, is a Tower of Victory, now crumbling to pieces,\nand everywhere the living rock of the original foundation is close at hand.\nThe life of the garrison within this fortress must have been strangely like\nthat of a camp.\n\np. 103\n\nLong and narrow, like some lean grey lion crouching for the spring, lies\nwalled Chitore on its craggy hill. And the newly-arrived traveller watching it\nmay see it to-night, as the returning escort may have seen it when Padmini\'s\nmarriage procession halted for the last time on the homeward way, more than\nseven centuries ago. Then, as now, the long heavy walls curved lovingly, like\nthe canvas of a tent, about the city. Little can the "lotus fair" Padmini have\nslept that night, the last of the long journey from her father\'s distant\nstronghold. Rather must she have gazed on through hour after hour of waking\ndreamfulness, counting the tale of the turrets and bastions of the fortress\nthat to-morrow she would enter as bride and queen. Within her was the\nconfidence of the Indian wife, who thinks of herself as beginning what is only\na new chapter in an old story, as recovering a thread that was held but a\nwhile ago, and dropped at death. Not for the first time were they to take up\nto-morrow the tale of life together--it was an ancient comradeship of the\nsoul. Did no vision of the future cast its shadow across the path before her\nto make Padmini shrink and pause, in the glory of this her great homecoming?\nHad the bard whispered no word above her cradle of the tragedy of greatness\nthat lay before her? Did she know that as long as winds should wail over\nChitore they would sing her name, that with her\n\np. 104\n\nwould every stone and every building be associated in the world\'s memory till\nthe end of time? To her, what would be was but the following of the path of\nRajput honour. Was it not always said that, in the hour of birth, the eyes of\na boy were set upon a knife and those of a girl upon a lamp--for the man must\nleave life by way of the sword and woman by that of fire?\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: An Indian Amulet](seh20.htm)\n\n'
