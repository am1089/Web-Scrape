He who gives vigour like wealth acquired by the fathers\n[1](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:1:1), who is a good guide like the instruction of a\nsage, who is pleased (by worship) like a comfortably resting guest\n[2](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:1:2), (Agni) has crossed the (sacrificial) seat of\nthe worshipper like a Hot _ri_.\n\n2\\. He who being truthful like the god Savit _ri_\n[1](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:2:1) protects by his power of mind all settlements\n[2](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:2:2), praised by many like impetuous splendour\n[3](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:2:3), the truthful one has become dear like vital\nbreath and worthy to be searched for [4](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:2:4).\n\n3 [1](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:3:1). (Agni) who possessing every refreshment\ndwells on the earth like a god, like a king who has made himself (valiant)\nfriends [2](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:3:2), like heroes who sit in front and under\nshelter, like a blameless wife beloved by her husband--\n\n4\\. Thee, O Agni, who art constantly kindled in the house, men have worshipped\nin their firm dwellings. They have placed in him rich splendour\n[1](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:4:1). Be thou possessed of all life, a supporter of\nriches [2](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:4:2).\n\n5\\. May the liberal givers, O Agni, attain nourishment, may the rich\n[1](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:5:1) who bestow gifts (on us) attain to a full span\nof life. May we win in battles the booty of him who does not give\n[1](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:5:1), obtaining a (rich) share before the gods, that\nwe may win glory [2](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:5:2).\n\n6\\. The lowing milch-cows of _Ri_ ta, assigned by Heaven, were exuberant with\ntheir full udders. The rivers imploring the favour (of the gods) from afar\n\np. 89\n\nhave broken through the midst of the rock with their floods.\n\n7\\. Imploring favour from thee, O Agni, the worshipful (gods) have won glory\nin the sky. They have made Night and Dawn of different shapes; they have\njoined the black and red colour (to Night and Dawn).\n\n8\\. And may we, our liberal givers and ourselves, be the mortals whom thou\nfurtherest to wealth, O Agni [1](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:8:1). Like a shadow thou\nfollowest the whole world, having filled the two worlds (Heaven and Earth) and\nthe air [2](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:8:2).\n\n9\\. May we, O Agni, guarded by thee, conquer with our racers the racers, with\nour men the men, with our heroes the heroes (of our enemies). Being masters of\nthe riches which their fathers [1](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:9:1) have conquered,\nmay our rich (givers) reach a hundred winters.\n\n10\\. May these hymns, O Agni, worshipper (of the gods), be grateful to thee,\nto thy mind and heart. May we be able to bridle thee, the well-harnessed\nwealth [1](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:10:1), acquiring the glory which the gods have\nassigned us.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi and metre.--Verse 5 = MS. IV, 14, 15. Verse 7 = TB. II, 7,\n12, 5. Verse 10 = MS. IV, 14, 15.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Agni is compared to wealth acquired by the fathers, being himself pit\n_ri_ vitta, found by the forefathers\n\np. 90\n\nof the Brahmanic tribes. Prof. Max Muller proposes to translate: 'wealth\ninherited from the fathers.'\n\nNote 2. Comp. VII, 42, 4, and see also VI, 16, 42.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. The first Pada is identical with the fourth of IX, 97, 48. There the\nexpressions are referred to Soma.\n\nNote 2. On v _ri_ _g_ ana, comp. the quotations given above, I, 60, 3, note 2;\ncf. IX, 87, 2. v _ri_ _g_ anam rakshama _n_ a _h_.\n\nNote 3. Comp. I, 64, 9. amati _h_ na dar _s_ ata\xc2\xb4.\n\nNote 4. Comp. II, 4, 1 (see below).\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. The first three Padas are nearly identical with III, 55, 21.\n\nNote 2. As to the meaning of hitamitra, comp. X, 108, 3. mitram ena dadhama;\nsee also X, 132, 5, and H. O., Religion des Veda, 186, note 1.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Comp. I, 72, 10 (see above).\n\nNote 2. I cannot accept Pischel's translation of dharu _n_ a _h_ rayi _n_ a\xc2\xb4m,\n'der Reichtum fliessen lasst' (Vedische Studien, I, 40).--'Be thou, who art\nrich in all food, the protector of riches.' M. M.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. On suri and ari, see Bergaigne, Rel. Ved. II, 218 seq. Arya _h_ may\nalso be nom. pl. and mean '(we) the poor ones.'\n\nNote 2. 'May we win in battles the booty of the enemy, setting aside a share\nfor the gods to their glory.' M. M.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. In the first Pada one syllable is wanting. Perhaps the acc. plur. ya\xc2\xb4n\nhad here dissyllabic value.\n\nNote 2. The last Pada is identical with the second of X, 139, 2.\n\np. 91\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. Comp. above, verse 1, note 1.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. Comp. _s_ akema va _g_ ina _h_ yamam, II, 5, 1; agne _s_ akema te\nvayam yamam devasya va _g_ ina _h_ , III, 27, 3. As sudhur and sudhura are\nepithets of horses, the poet of course could say, _s_ akema sudhura _h_ yamam\nte. But Agni is not only a horse; he is also wealth (II, 1, 12; IV, 2, 5,\n&c.). The combination of the two metaphors explains the curious expression\nsudhura _h_ raya _h_.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 74](sbe46024.htm)\n\n"
