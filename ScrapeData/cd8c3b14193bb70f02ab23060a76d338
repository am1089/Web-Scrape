The Valakhilyas said to Pra _g_ apati Kratu: \'O Saint, if thou thus\nshowest the greatness of that Self, then who is that other different one, also\ncalled Self 4, who really overcome by bright and dark fruits of action, enters\non a good or bad birth?\n\np. 296\n\n[paragraph continues] Downward or upward is his course 1, and overcome by the\npairs (distinction between hot and cold, pleasure and pain, &c.) he roams\nabout 2.\'\n\n2\\. Pra _g_ apati Kratu replied: \'There is indeed that other 3 different one,\ncalled the elemental Self (Bhutatma), who, overcome by bright and dark fruits\nof action, enters on a good or bad birth: downward or upward is his course,\nand overcome by the pairs he roams about. And this is his explanation: The\nfive Tanmatras 4 (sound, touch, form, taste, smell) are called Bhuta; also the\nfive Mahabhutas (gross elements) are called Bhuta. Then the aggregate 5 of all\nthese is called _s_ arira, body 6. And lastly he of whom it was said that he\ndwelt in the body 7, he is called Bhutatma, the elemental Self. Thus his\nimmortal Self 8 is like a drop of water on a lotus leaf 9, and he himself is\novercome by the qualities of nature. Then 10, because he is thus overcome, he\nbecomes bewildered, and because he is bewildered, he saw not the creator, the\nholy Lord, abiding within himself. Carried along by the waves of the qualities\n11, darkened in his imaginations, unstable, fickle,\n\np. 297\n\ncrippled, full of desires, vacillating, he enters into belief, believing "I am\nhe," "this is mine 1;" he binds his Self by his Self, as a bird with a net,\nand overcome afterwards by the fruits of what he has done, he enters on a good\nand bad birth; downward or upward is his course, and overcome by the pairs he\nroams about.\'\n\nThey asked: \'Which is it?\' And he answered them:\n\n3\\. \'This also has elsewhere been said: He who acts, is the elemental Self; he\nwho causes to act by means of the organs 2, is the inner man (anta _h_\npurusha). Now as even a ball of iron, pervaded (overcome) by fire, and\nhammered by smiths, becomes manifold (assumes different forms, such as\ncrooked, round, large, small 3), thus the elemental Self, pervaded (overcome)\nby the inner man, and hammered by the qualities, becomes manifold 4. And the\nfour tribes (mammals, birds, &c.), the fourteen worlds (Bhur, &c.), with all\nthe number of beings, multiplied eighty-four times 5, all this appears as\nmanifoldness. And those multiplied things are impelled by man (purusha) as the\nwheel by the potter 6. And as when the ball of iron is hammered, the fire is\nnot overcome, so the (inner) man is not overcome, but the elemental Self is\novercome, because it has united itself (with the elements).\n\np. 298\n\n4\\. And it has been said elsewhere 1: This body produced from marriage, and\nendowed with growth 2 in darkness, came forth by the urinary passage, was\nbuilt up with bones, bedaubed with flesh, thatched with skin, filled with\nordure, urine, bile, slime, marrow, fat, oil 3, and many impurities besides,\nlike a treasury full of treasures 4.\n\n5\\. And it has been said elsewhere: Bewilderment, fear, grief, sleep, sloth,\ncarelessness, decay, sorrow, hunger, thirst, niggardliness, wrath, infidelity,\nignorance, envy, cruelty 5, folly, shamelessness, meanness 6, pride,\nchangeability 7, these are the results of the quality of darkness (tama _h_ )\n8.\n\np. 299\n\nInward thirst, fondness, passion, covetousness, unkindness, love, hatred,\ndeceit [1](sbe15115.htm#fn_1002), jealousy, vain restlessness, fickleness\n[2](sbe15115.htm#fn_1003), unstableness, emulation, greed, patronising of\nfriends, family pride, aversion to disagreeable objects, devotion to agreeable\nobjects, whispering [3](sbe15115.htm#fn_1004), prodigality, these are the\nresults of the quality of passion (ra _g_ as).\n\nBy these he is filled, by these he is overcome, and therefore this elemental\nSelf assumes manifold forms, yes, manifold forms.\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[295:4](sbe15114.htm#fr_979) The pure Self, called atma, brahma, _k_ inmatram,\npra _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anaghanam, &c., after entering what he had himself created, and no\nlonger distinguishing himself from the created things (bhuta), is called\nBhutatma.\n\n[296:1](sbe15114.htm#fr_980) M. reads here and afterwards avakam urdhva _m_ va\ngatidvandvai _h_.\n\n[296:2](sbe15114.htm#fr_981) M. adds at the end, paribhramatiti katama esha\niti, tan hova _k_ eti, and leaves it out at the end of \xc2\xa7 2.\n\n[296:3](sbe15114.htm#fr_982) M. here reads avara.\n\n[296:4](sbe15114.htm#fr_983) M. reads tanmatra _n_ i.\n\n[296:5](sbe15114.htm#fr_984) M. reads tesha _m_ samudayas ta _k_ _kh_ ariram.\n\n[296:6](sbe15114.htm#fr_985) The commentator distinguishes between li\xe1\xb9\x85ga- _s_\narira, consisting of pra _n_ as, indriyas, the anta _h_ karana, and the\nsukshmabhutas; and the sthula- _s_ arira, consisting of the five Mahabhutas.\n\n[296:7](sbe15114.htm#fr_986) M. reads _s_ ariram ity uktam.\n\n[296:8](sbe15114.htm#fr_987) M. reads athasti tasya _h_ bindur iva.\n\n[296:9](sbe15114.htm#fr_988) It sticks to it, yet it can easily run off again.\n\n[296:10](sbe15114.htm#fr_989) M. reads Ato, and the commentator explains atho\nby ata _h_ kara _n_ at, adding sandhi _h_ _kh_ andasa _h_.\n\n[296:11](sbe15114.htm#fr_990) See VI, 30.\n\n[297:1](sbe15114.htm#fr_991) M. reads aha _m_ so mamedam.\n\n[297:2](sbe15114.htm#fr_992) M. anta _h_ kara _n_ ai _h_.\n\n[297:3](sbe15114.htm#fr_993) See commentary, p. 48, l. 7.\n\n[297:4](sbe15114.htm#fr_994) AI. reads upety atha trigu _n_ a _m_ _k_ atur _g_\nalam.\n\n[297:5](sbe15114.htm#fr_995) M. reads _k_ atura _s_ itilakshayonipari _n_\natam. See also Anubhutipraka _s_ a, ver. 118.\n\n[297:6](sbe15114.htm#fr_996) M _ri_ tyava seems an impossible word, though the\ncommentator twice explains it as kulala, potter. M. reads _k_ akri _n_ eti,\nwhich seems preferable. Weber conjectures m _ri_ tpa _k_ a.\n\n[298:1](sbe15114.htm#fr_997) Part of this passage has been before the mind of\nthe author of the Manava-dharma _s_ astra, when writing, VI, 76, 77: asthisthu\n_n_ a _m_ snayuyutam ma _m_ sa _s_ o _n_ italepanam, _k_ armavanaddha _m_\ndurgandhi pur _n_ am mutrapurishayo _h_ , _g_ ara _s_ okasamavish _t_ a _m_\nrogayatanam aturam ra _g_ asvalam anitya _m_ _k_ a bhatavasam ima _m_ tya _g_\net. The same verses occur in the Mahabharata XII, 12463-4, only with tya _g_ a\nat the end, instead of tya _g_ et. The rendering of asthibhi _s_ _k_ itam by\nasthisthu _n_ am shows that _k_ ita was understood to mean piled or built up,\ni.e. supported by bones.\n\n[298:2](sbe15114.htm#fr_998) Instead of sa _m_ v _ri_ ddhyupetam M. reads sa\n_m_ viddhyapetam.\n\n[298:3](sbe15114.htm#fr_999) M. adds snayu after vasa, and instead of amayai\n_h_ reads malai _h_. This reading, malai _h_ , would seem preferable, though\nManu\'s rogayatanam might be quoted in support of amayai _h_. The exact meaning\nof vasa is given in the \xc3\x82ryavidyasudhakara, p. 82, l. 9.\n\n[298:4](sbe15114.htm#fr_1000) Therefore should wise people not identify their\ntrue Self with the body. M. reads vasuneti.\n\n[298:5](sbe15114.htm#fr_1001) M. reads vaikaru _n_ yam.\n\n[298:6](sbe15114.htm#fr_1002) Instead of nirak _ri_ tityam M. reads nik _ri_\ntatvam, which is decidedly preferable. We may take it to mean either meanness,\nas opposed to uddhatatvam, overbearing, or knavery, the usual meaning of nik\n_ri_ ti.\n\n[298:7](sbe15114.htm#fr_1003) M. reads asatvam, possibly for asattvam.\n\n[298:8](sbe15114.htm#fr_1004) M. reads tamasanvitai _h_ , and afterwards ra\n_g_ asanvitai _h_ ; also t _ri_ shna instead of antast _ri_ shna.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Fourth Prapathaka](sbe15115.htm)\n\n'
