Ever since we have come\nupon the Earth we have been plundering her; and the more we claimed, the more\nshe submitted. From primeval days have we men been plucking fruits, cutting\ndown trees, digging up the soil, killing beast, bird and fish. From the bottom\nof the sea, from underneath the ground, from the very jaws of death, it has\nall been grabbing and grabbing and grabbing--no strong-box in Nature\'s store-\nroom has been respected or left unrifled. The one delight of this Earth is to\nfulfil the claims of those who are men. She has been made fertile and\nbeautiful and complete through her endless sacrifices to them. But for this,\nshe would be lost in the wilderness, not knowing herself, the doors of her\nheart shut, her diamonds and pearls never seeing the light.\n\nLikewise, by sheer force of our claims, we men have opened up all the latent\npossibilities of women. In the process of surrendering themselves to us, they\nhave ever gained their true greatness. Because they had to bring all the\ndiamonds of their happiness and the pearls of their sorrow into our royal\ntreasury, they have found their true wealth. So for men to accept is truly to\ngive: for women to give is truly to gain.\n\nThe demand I have just made from Bimala, however, is indeed a large one! At\nfirst I felt scruples; for is it not the habit of man\'s mind to be in\npurposeless conflict with itself? I thought I had imposed too hard a task. My\nfirst impulse was to call her back, and tell her I would rather not make her\nlife wretched by dragging her into all these troubles. I forgot, for the\nmoment, that it was the mission of man to be aggressive, to make woman\'s\nexistence fruitful by stirring up disquiet in the depth of her passivity, to\nmake the whole world blessed by churning up the immeasurable abyss of\nsuffering! This is why man\'s hands are so strong, his grip so firm. Bimala had\nbeen longing with all her heart that I, Sandip, should demand of her some\ngreat sacrifice-- should call her to her death. How else could she be happy?\nHad she not waited all these weary years only for an opportunity to weep out\nher heart--so satiated was she with the monotony of her placid happiness? And\ntherefore, at the very sight of me, her heart\'s horizon darkened with the rain\nclouds of her impending days of anguish. If I pity her and save her from her\nsorrows, what then was the purpose of my being born a man?\n\nThe real reason of my qualms is that my demand happens to be for money. That\nsavours of beggary, for money is man\'s, not woman\'s. That is why I had to make\nit a big figure. A thousand or two would have the air of petty theft. Fifty\nthousand has all the expanse of romantic brigandage. Ah, but riches should\nreally have been mine! So many of my desires have had to halt, again and\nagain, on the road to accomplishment simply for want of money. This does not\nbecome me! Had my fate been merely unjust, it could be forgiven--but its bad\ntaste is unpardonable. It is not simply a hardship that a man like me should\nbe at his wit\'s end to pay his house rent, or should have to carefully count\nout the coins for an Intermediate Class railway ticket--it is vulgar!\n\nIt is equally clear that Nikhil\'s paternal estates are a superfluity to him.\nFor him it would not have been at all unbecoming to be poor. He would have\ncheerfully pulled in the double harness of indigent mediocrity with that\nprecious master of his. I should love to have, just for once, the chance to\nfling about fifty thousand rupees in the service of my country and to the\nsatisfaction of myself. I am a nabob born, and it is a great dream of mine to\nget rid of this disguise of poverty, though it be for a day only, and to see\nmyself in my true character. I have grave misgivings, however, as to Bimala\never getting that fifty thousand rupees within her reach, and it will probably\nbe only a thousand or two which will actually come to hand. Be it so. The wise\nman is content with half a loaf, or any fraction for that matter, rather than\nno bread. I must return to these personal reflections of mine later. News\ncomes that I am wanted at once. Something has gone wrong ...\n\nIt seems that the police have got a clue to the man who sank Mirjan\'s boat for\nus. He was an old offender. They are on his trail, but he should be too\npractised a hand to be caught blabbing. However, one never knows. Nikhil\'s\nback is up, and his manager may not be able to have things his own way.\n\n"If I get into trouble, sir," said the manager when I saw him, "I shall have\nto drag you in!"\n\n"Where is the noose with which you can catch me?" I asked.\n\n"I have a letter of yours, and several of Amulya Babu\'s." I could not see that\nthe letter marked "urgent" to which I had been hurried into writing a reply\nwas wanted urgently for this purpose only! I am getting to learn quite a\nnumber of things.\n\nThe point now is, that the police must be bribed and hush-money paid to Mirjan\nfor his boat. It is also becoming evident that much of the cost of this\npatriotic venture of ours will find its way as profit into the pockets of\nNikhil\'s manager. However, I must shut my eyes to that for the present, for is\nhe not shouting _Bande Mataram_ as lustily as I am?\n\nThis kind of work has always to be carried on with leaky vessels which let as\nmuch through as they fetch in. We all have a hidden fund of moral judgement\nstored away within us, and so I was about to wax indignant with the manager,\nand enter in my diary a tirade against the unreliability of our countrymen.\nBut, if there be a god, I must acknowledge with gratitude to him that he has\ngiven me a clear-seeing mind, which allows nothing inside or outside it to\nremain vague. I may delude others, but never myself. So I was unable to\ncontinue angry.\n\nWhatever is true is neither good nor bad, but simply true, and that is\nScience. A lake is only the remnant of water which has not been sucked into\nthe ground. Underneath the cult of _Bande Mataram_ , as indeed at the bottom\nof all mundane affairs, there is a region of slime, whose absorbing power must\nbe reckoned with. The manager will take what he wants; I also have my own\nwants. These lesser wants form a part of the wants of the great Cause--the\nhorse must be fed and the wheels must be oiled if the best progress is to be\nmade.\n\nThe long and short of it is that money we must have, and that soon. We must\ntake whatever comes the readiest, for we cannot afford to wait. I know that\nthe immediate often swallows up the ultimate; that the five thousand rupees of\ntoday may nip in the bud the fifty thousand rupees of tomorrow. But I must\naccept the penalty. Have I not often twitted Nikhil that they who walk in the\npaths of restraint have never known what sacrifice is? It is we greedy folk\nwho have to sacrifice our greed at every step!\n\nOf the cardinal sins of man, Desire is for men who are men--but Delusion,\nwhich is only for cowards, hampers them. Because delusion keeps them wrapped\nup in past and future, but is the very deuce for confounding their footsteps\nin the present. Those who are always straining their ears for the call of the\nremote, to the neglect of the call of the imminent, are like Sakuntala  19\nabsorbed in the memories of her lover. The guest comes unheeded, and the curse\ndescends, depriving them of the very object of their desire.\n\nThe other day I pressed Bimala\'s hand, and that touch still stirs her mind, as\nit vibrates in mine. Its thrill must not be deadened by repetition, for then\nwhat is now music will descend to mere argument. There is at present no room\nin her mind for the question "why?" So I must not deprive Bimala, who is one\nof those creatures for whom illusion is necessary, of her full supply of it.\n\nAs for me, I have so much else to do that I shall have to be content for the\npresent with the foam of the wine cup of passion. O man of desire! Curb your\ngreed, and practise your hand on the harp of illusion till you can bring out\nall the delicate nuances of suggestion. This is not the time to drain the cup\nto the dregs.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[19](hw29.htm#fr_18) Sakuntala, after the king, her lover, went back to his\nkingdom, promising to send for her, was so lost in thoughts of him, that she\nfailed to hear the call of her hermit guest. who thereupon cursed her, saying\nthat the object of her love would forget all about her.
