But there is (a scriptural statement of the origination of ether).\n\nThe conjunction \'but\' indicates the adoption of another alternative.--The\norigin of ether may not be stated in the _Kh_ andogya; but it _is_ stated in\nother scriptural passages. For the text of the Taittiriyakas, after having\nintroduced Brahman as the general subject-matter,--in the words, \'The true,\nknowledge, without end is Brahman,\'--goes on to say, \'From that Self sprang\nether\' (Taitt. Up. II, 1).--Hence there arises a conflict of scriptural\npassages, the creation sometimes being said to begin with fire, sometimes with\nether.--But may we not appropriately assume the two scriptural passages to\nform one syntactical whole?--It would be well indeed if we could do so, but a\nunity of the kind desired cannot be admitted, because the creator who is\nmentioned only once--in the passage \'he sent forth fire\'--cannot be connected\nwith two things to be created, as if the construction were \'He sent forth\nfire, he sent forth ether.\'--But--an objection may be raised--we see that\nsometimes an agent, although^ mentioned once only, is yet\n\np. 5\n\nconnected with two objects; as when we say \'after having cooked broth he now\ncooks rice.\' We therefore may combine the two scriptural sentences into one,\n\'Brahman having created ether created fire.\'--Such a combination of sentences,\nwe reply, is not admissible here, because the _Kh_ andogya intimates that fire\nwas created first, while the Taittiriyaka assigns the same position to ether,\nand because it is impossible that both should have been created first.--The\nsame remarks apply to a further contradiction involved in the other scriptural\npassage, \'From that Self sprang ether,\' &c.; for there also the material cause\nand the fact of origination, being mentioned only once, cannot he connected\nwith fire as well as ether, so as to effect a sentence of the following kind,\n\'from that there sprang ether, from that there sprang fire.\' Moreover the\nTaittiriyaka states separately that \'fire (sprang) from air 1."--With regard\nto this conflict of statements somebody now maintains the following view.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[5:1](sbe38003.htm#fr_2) While the _Kh_ and, says that fire sprang from the\nSelf.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 3](sbe38004.htm)\n\n'
