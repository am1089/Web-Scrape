SHITALA.\n\nShitala is the Bengali name for the small-pox, and for the deity who is\nsupposed to have charge of that disease. The meaning of the word is "She who\nmakes cold."\n\n[![SHITALA.](tn/47300.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/47300.jpg)  \nSHITALA.  \n\nThis goddess is represented as a golden-complexioned woman sitting on a lotus,\nor riding on an ass, dressed in red clothes. Before an image of this kind, or\nmore\n\np. 474\n\ncommonly a pan of water merely, Shitala is worshipped in the hope that she\nwill preserve her worshippers from this dire disease.\n\nIn the spring of the year, the Hindus formerly inoculated their children for\nthis disease when they were about two years of age. The Br\xc4\x81hman who performed\nthe operation made presents to render Shitala propitious, and promised, in\ncase the work was successful, to give still greater gifts. At the close of the\noperation the flowers that were presented to the goddess were placed in the\nhair of the child as a charm. On behalf of those afflicted with small-pox,\nofferings are made daily; and when the patient is thought to be dangerously\nill, he is placed in front of an image of Shitala, bathed in, and given to\ndrink, water that has been offered to her. Beggars go about with a stone,\npartly gilded, which they teach is sacred to Shitala, and, in seasons when the\ndisease is prevalent, receive presents from the superstitious. *\n\n##### 2\\. MANAS\xc4\x80.\n\nManas\xc4\x81 is the sister of Vasuki, king of the snakes; the wife of Jaratk\xc4\x81ru, a\nsage; and being the queen of the snakes is regarded as the protectress of men\nfrom those reptiles. Another name by which she is known is Vishahara, "the\ndestroyer of poison." Generally, offerings are made to her without any image\nbeing made, a branch of a tree, a pan of water, an earthen snake being her\nrepresentative; when her image is made, it is that of a woman clothed with\nsnakes, sitting on a lotus, or standing upon a snake. A song founded upon the\nfollowing story concludes the worship of this deity.\n\np. 475\n\nA merchant named Ch\xc4\x81nda not only refused to worship Manas\xc4\x81, but professed the\nprofoundest contempt for her. In process of time six of his sons died from\nsnake-bites. To avoid a similar fate, his eldest son Lakindara dwelt in an\niron house; but Manas\xc4\x81 caused a snake to enter through a crevice, which bit\nhim on his wedding-day and caused his death too. His widow, however, escaped,\nand went weeping to her mother-in-law,\n\n[![MANAS\xc4\x80.](tn/47500.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/47500.jpg)  \nMANAS\xc4\x80.  \n\nwho, with the neighbours, vainly tried to induce Ch\xc4\x81nda to propitiate the\ngoddess through whose influence so much evil had come to the family; Manas\xc4\x81\nherself urged his friends to prevail upon him not to remain so hostile to her.\nAt last he so far yielded to\n\np. 476\n\ntheir wishes as to throw a single flower with his left hand towards her image,\nwhich so delighted her that she restored his sons to life, and from that time,\nas men came to know of her power, her worship has become celebrated. *\n\nThe Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata gives the following particulars regarding her marriage.\nJagatak\xc4\x81ru, her husband, was an eminent sage, who had practised great\nausterities, bathed in all the holy tanks, abstained from matrimony, and, as a\nresult of his penance and fasting, had a dry and shrivelled body. In the\ncourse of his wanderings, he came to a place where he saw a number of men\nhanging from a tree with their heads downwards over a deep abyss, with a rat\ngnawing the rope by which they were suspended, and learned that they were his\nown ancestors, doomed to endure this misery because, their children being\ndead, they had no one to release them ( _i.e._ by performing religious\nceremonies); and he, who, by having a son might have set them free, was given\nup to a life of austerity, and refused to marry. When they are told that\nJagatak\xc4\x81ru is the man through whose abstinence they are suffering, they\nentreat him to seek a wife and secure their deliverance. He consents to do so\non condition that the parents of the girl he marries give her to him\nwillingly. V\xc4\x81suki hearing of this, offers his sister to the sage, who marries\nher and has a son named Asika. This son effected the deliverance of his\nancestors and also rendered good service to the serpent race in saving them\nfrom destruction when Janamejaya was wishful to exterminate them.\n\np. 477\n\n##### 3\\. SAST\xc4\xaa.\n\nSast\xc4\xab is peculiarly the goddess of married women; she is the giver of\nchildren, assists at childbirth, and is the guardian of young children. She is\nrepresented as a golden-complexioned woman with a child in her arms, riding\nupon a cat; hence no Hindu woman would under\n\n[![SASTI.](tn/47700.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/47700.jpg)  \nSASTI.  \n\nany circumstances injure that animal, lest she should offend the goddess and\nbe made to suffer for it. Six times a year festivals in honour of Sast\xc4\xab are\nheld; in addition to which, women who have lost their children by death\nworship her monthly. When a child is six days old, the father worships her;\nand when three\n\np. 478\n\nweeks old, the mother presents offerings to her. The ordinary representative\nof Sast\xc4\xab is a stone about the size of a man\'s head, placed under a Banyan\ntree, which is decorated with flowers, and offerings of rice, fruit, etc., are\nmade to it. *\n\n##### 4\\. THE SH\xc4\x80LGR\xc4\x80MA.\n\nBy the worshippers of Vishnu, the Sh\xc4\x81lgr\xc4\x81ma is regarded as a most sacred\nobject. It does not derive its sacredness from consecrating rites, as images\nand other representatives of deities, but is believed to be inherently holy.\nIt is a black ammonite, found in Mount Gandak\xc4\xab in Nepal. The popular belief is\nthat in this mountain there are insects which perforate the stones; and when\nperforated, falling into the river Gandaka, they are taken out by means of\nnets. The more common ones are about the size of a watch, and their price\nvaries according to their size, hollowness, and inside colouring, according to\nwhich peculiarities special names are given. For the rarer kinds as much as\nRs. 2000 are given; and as it is the common belief of the people that the\npossessor of one of these, and a shell called Dakshin\xc4\x81varta ( _i.e._ a shell\nwhose convolutions are towards the right), can never be poor, it is not to be\nwondered at that large prices should be paid for them. As it is also believed\nthat in parting with them they invite misfortune, it is natural that few\nshould wish to part with them; to sell them for gain is regarded as a most\ndishonourable deed.\n\nA reason for the sacredness of the Sh\xc4\x81lgr\xc4\x81ma is found in the "Bh\xc4\x81gavata\nPur\xc4\x81na." Sani commenced his reign with a request to Brahm\xc4\x81 to become subject\nto him;\n\np. 479\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahm\xc4\x81 referred him to Vishnu, who asked him to call\nupon him the next day. When he called, finding that Vishnu had transformed\nhimself into a mountain, he became a worm named Vajrak\xc4\xabta, and afflicted him\nfor twelve years. At the expiration of that time Vishnu resumed his proper\nshape, and ordered that henceforth the stones of this mountain (Gandak\xc4\xab)\nshould be worshipped as representatives of himself. *\n\nThe Br\xc4\x81hmans usually worship Vishnu in this form in their daily _puja_ at\nhome. In the hot season a vessel is suspended over it, and the water\ncontinually dropping on it keeps it cool; another vessel is placed under it to\ncatch the water, which is drunk in the evening by the worshipper. The marks of\nit are shown to men when dying, in the belief that the concentration of the\nmind on them at this time will ensure the soul a safe passage to Vishnu\'s\nheaven. \xe2\x80\xa0\n\n##### 5\\. THE DHENK\xc4\xaa.\n\nThe Dhenk\xc4\xab is a log of wood fixed to a pivot, used for husking rice, pounding\nbricks for mortar, etc. It is generally worked by women, who, by standing on\nthe one end, raise it to a certain height and then let it fall by its own\nweight. It is said to be the V\xc4\x81han or vehicle of N\xc4\x81rada, and it is believed\nthat, owing to his blessing, it became an object of worship. A religious\nteacher, when initiating a disciple into the mysteries of Hinduism, told him\nto say, "Dhenk\xc4\xab, Dhenk\xc4\xab." N\xc4\x81rada, hearing this, was delighted, and coming upon\nhis V\xc4\x81han gave him another incantation by which he became\n\np. 480\n\nperfect and was admitted into heaven. It is worshipped at the time of\nmarriage, at the investiture of a son with the Poita or Br\xc4\x81hmanical thread, at\nthe ceremony of giving rice to a child, and on other festive occasions. At the\nclose of the last century a R\xc4\x81ja of Naladanga is said to have spent Rs.\n300,000 in celebrating the worship of the Dhenk\xc4\xab.\n\n##### 6\\. KA? WHO?\n\nThe Athenians were not alone in worshipping the "Unknown God." "The authors of\nthe Br\xc4\x81hmanas had so completely broken with the past, that, forgetful of the\npoetical character of the hymns (of the Vedas), and the yearning of the poets\nafter the unknown god, they exalted the interrogative pronoun itself into a\ndeity, and acknowledged a god, Ka? or \'Who?\' In the \'Taittiriya Br\xc4\x81hmana,\' in\nthe \'Kansh\xc4\xabtaki Br\xc4\x81hmana,\' in the \'T\xc4\x81ndya Br\xc4\x81hmana,\' and in the \'Satapatha\nBr\xc4\x81hmana,\' wherever interrogative verses occur, the author states that Ka is\nPraj\xc4\x81pati, or the lord of creatures. Nor did they stop here. Some of the hymns\nin which the interrogative pronoun occurred were called Kadvat, _i.e._ ,\nhaving kad or quid. But soon a new adjective was formed, and not only the\nhymns, but the sacrifices also, offered to the god, were called K\xc4\x81ya, or \'Who-\nish.\' At the time of P\xc4\x81nini (the great grammarian), this word had acquired\nsuch legitimacy as to call for a separate rule explaining its formation. The\ncommentator here explains Ka by Br\xc4\x81hman. After this, we can hardly wonder that\nin the later Sanskrit literature of the Pur\xc4\x81nas, Ka appears as a recognized\ngod, with a genealogy of his own, perhaps even a wife; and that in the laws of\nManu one of the recognized forms of marriage, genet ally known by the name of\nthe Praj\xc4\x81pati\n\np. 481\n\nmarriage, occurs under the monstrous title of K\xc4\x81ya." * In the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata Ka\nis identified with Daksha, and in the "Bh\xc4\x81gavata Pur\xc4\x81na" it is applied to\nKasyapa, probably on account of their similarity to Praj\xc4\x81pati.\n\n\n\n[![THE NIM.](tn/48100.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/48100.jpg)  \nTHE NIM.  \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[474:*](hmvp47.htm#fr_442) Ward, ii. 139.\n\n[476:*](hmvp47.htm#fr_443) Ward, ii. 142.\n\n[478:*](hmvp47.htm#fr_444) Ward, ii. 143.\n\n[479:*](hmvp47.htm#fr_445) For another account of the origin of the worship of\nthe Sh\xc4\x81lgr\xc4\x81ma, see the account of Tulsi, chap. ix.\n\n[479:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp47.htm#fr_446) Ward, ii. 221.\n\n[481:*](hmvp47.htm#fr_447) Max-Muller, quoted in Dowson\'s Classical\nDictionary, _s.v._ "Ka?"\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XI.
