S\xc2\x92ri Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! The wife of Dharmadhvaja was\nMadhavi. Going to the Gandhamadan mountain, She began to enjoy, with great\ngladness, the pleasures with the king Dharmadhvaja. The bed was prepared,\nstrewn with flowers and scented with sandal-paste. She smeared all over her\nbody with sandal-paste. The flowers and cool breeze in contact with the sweet\nscent of sandal-paste began to cool the bodies. Madhavi was the jewel amongst\nwomen. Her whole body was very elegant. Besides it was adorned all over with\njewel ornaments. As she was humorous, so the king was very expert in that\nrespect. It seemed as if the Creator created especially for Dharmadhvaja, the\nhumorous lady Madhavi expert in amorous affairs. Both of them were skilled in\namorous sports. So no one did like to desist from amorous enjoyments. One\nhundred divine years passed in this way, day and night passed unnoticed. The\nking then got back his consciousness and desisted from his amorous embraces.\nBut the lustful woman did not find herself satisfied. However, by the Deva\xc2\x92s\ninfluence, she became pregnant and conceived for one hundred years. In the\nwomb there was the incarnation of Lak _s_ mi; and the body\xc2\x92s lustre increased\nday by day. Then, on an auspicious day, on an auspicious moment, auspicious\nYoga, auspicious Lagna, auspicious Amsa, and on an auspicious combination of\nplanetary\n\n\n\np. 871\n\n\n\nrulers and their houses, she delivered on the full moon night of the month of\nKartik one beautiful daughter, the incarnation in part of Lak _s_ mi. The face\nof the baby looked like the autumnal moon; Her two eyes resembled autumnal\nlotuses and her upper and lower lips looked beautiful like ripe Bimba fruits.\nThe daughter began, no sooner it was born, to look on all sides of the lying-\nin-room. The palm and lower part of feet were red. The navel was deep and\nbelow that there were three wrinkles. Her loins were circular. Her body was\nhot in the winter and cold in the summer and pleasant to touch. Her hairs on\nthe head were hanging like the roots of the fig tree. Her colour was bright\nlike Champaka; She was a jewel amongst women. Men and women cannot compare her\nbeauty. The holy wise men named Her Tulasi. As soon as she was born, she\nlooked of the female sex, full in every way. Though prevented repeatedly by\nall, She went to the forest of Badari for practising Tapasya. There she\npractised hard Tapasya for one lakh divine years. Her main object was to get\nNaraya _n_ a for her husband. In summer she practise Panchatapa (surrounded by\nfire on four sides and on the top); in the winter she remained in water and in\nthe rainy season she remained in the open air and endured the showers of the\nrain, twenty thousand years. She passed away thus in eating fruits and water.\nFor thirty thousand years she subsisted only on the leaves of trees. When the\nforty thousandth year came, she subsisted only on air and her body became\nthinner and thinner day by day. Then for ten thousand years afterwards she\nleft eating anything whatsoever and without any aim, stood on only one leg. At\nthis time the lotus-born Brahma, seeing this, appeared there to grant her\nboons. On seeing Him, Tulasi immediately bowed down to Brahma, the Four-faced\nOne riding on His vehicle, the Swan. [Note: -- The vehicle theory of the Devas\ncame from Egypt. The Devas were without vehicles at first and were faced half-\nbeasts. Then they were rendered men and their vehicles were fancied as beasts.\nThe face of the Durga Devi was thought of as that of a tiger.]\n\n\n\n20\\. He then addressed her and said :-- \xc2\x93O Tulasi! Ask a boon that you like.\nWhether it be devotion to Hari, servantship to Hari, freedom from old age or\nfreedom from death, I will grant that to you.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n21-27. Tulasi said :-- \xc2\x93Father! I now say you my mind. Hear. What is the use\nof hiding away my views out of fear or shame to One who knows everything\nreigning in One\xc2\x92s Heart.\n\n\n\nI am Tulasi Gopi (cowherdess); I used to dwell before in the Goloka. I was a\ndear she-servant of Radhika, the beloved of Kri _sn_ a. I was also born of Her\nin part, Her Sakhis (female attendants) used to love me. Once in Rasa Ma _nd_\nalam I was enjoyed by Govinda; but I was not satiated and while\n\n\n\np. 872\n\n\n\nI was lying down in an unconscious state, Radha, the Governess-in-chief of the\nRasa circle, came there and saw me in that state. She rebuked Gobinda and, out\nof anger, cursed me :-- \xc2\x91Go at once and be born as a human being.\xc2\x92 At this\nGovinda spoke to me :-- \xc2\x91If you go and practise Tapas in Bharata, Brahma will\nget pleased and He will grant you boon. When you will get Naraya _n_ a, the\nFour-armed, born of Me in part as your husband.\xc2\x92 O Father! Thus speaking, S\xc2\x92ri\nKri _sn_ a disappeared out of sight. Out of Radha\xc2\x92s fear, I quitted my body\nand am now born in this world. Now grant me this boon that I get the peaceful,\nlovely, beautiful Nara for my husband.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n28-37. Brahma said :-- \xc2\x93O Child Tulasi! The Gopa (cowherd) Sudama was born of\nS\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a\xc2\x92s body. At the present time he is very energetic, He too,\nunder the curse of Radha, has come and taken his birth amongst the Danavas. He\nis named S\xc2\x92ankha Chu _d_ a. No one is equal to him in strength. In Goloka,\nwhen he saw you before, he was overpowered with passion for you. Only out of\nRadha\xc2\x92s influence, he could not embrace you. That Sudama is Jatismara (knows\nall about his previous births); and you, too, are Jati Smara. There is nothing\nunknown to you. O Beautiful One! You will now be his wife. Afterwards you will\nget Naraya _n_ a, the Beautiful and Lovely for your husband. Thus under the\ncurse of Naraya _n_ a, you will be transformed into the world purifying Tulasi\ntree. You will be the foremost amongst the flowers and will be dearer to\nNaraya _n_ a than His life. No one\xc2\x92s worship will be complete without Thee as\nleaf. You will remain as a tree in Bindraban and you will be widely known as\nVrindabani. The Gopas and Gopis will worship Madhava with Your leaves. Being\nthe Presiding Deity of the Tulasi tree, you will always enjoy the company of\nKri _sn_ a, the best of the Gopas.\xc2\x94 O Narada! Thus bearing Brahma\xc2\x92s words, the\nDevi Tulasi became very glad. Smile appeared in her face. She then bowed down\nto the Creator and said :--\n\n\n\n38-40. \xc2\x93O Father! I speak now truly to Thee that I am not as devoted to the\nfour-armed Naraya _n_ a as I am devoted to S\xc2\x92yama Sundara, the two-armed. For\nmy intercourse with Govinda S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a was suddenly interrupted and my\ndesire was not gratified. It is because of S\xc2\x92ri Govinda\xc2\x92s words that I prayed\nfor the four-armed. Now it appears certain that by Thy grace I will get again\nmy Govinda, very hard to be attained. But, O Father! Do this that I be not\nafraid of Radha.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n41-48. Brahma said :-- \xc2\x93O Child! I now give you the sixteen lettered Radha\nmantra to you. By Her Grace you will be dear to Radha as Her life. Radhika\nwill not be able to know anything of your secret\n\n\n\np. 873\n\n\n\ndealings. O Fortunate! You will be dear to Govinda like Radha.\xc2\x94 Thus saying,\nBrahma, the Creator of the world, gave her the sixteen lettered Radha mantra,\nstotra, Kavacha and mode of worship and puras\xc2\x92chara _n_ a and He blessed her.\nTulasi, then, engaged herself in worshipping Radha, as directed. By the boon\nof Brahma, Tulasi attained Siddhi (success) like Lak _s_ mi. Out of the power\nof the Siddha mantra, She got her desired boon. She became fortunate in\ngetting various pleasures, hard to be attained in this world. Her mind became\nquiet. All the toils of Tapasya disappeared. When one gets the fruit of one\xc2\x92s\nlabour, all the troubles then transform to happiness. She then finished her\nfood and drink and slept on a beautiful bed strewn with flowers and scented\nwith sandal paste.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Seventeenth Chapter of the Ninth Book on the anecdote of Tulasi\nin S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 18](bk09ch18.htm)\n\n'
