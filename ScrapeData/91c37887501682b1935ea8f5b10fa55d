When poured forth, it went straight away from him and spread itself\nover the regions. The gods went in quest of it. By means of offerings (ish _t_\ni) they followed it up, by offerings they searched for it, and by offerings\nthey found it. And when he performs ish _t_ is, the Sacrificer thereby\nsearches for the horse (a _s_ va) meet for sacrifice 2 (medhya).\n\n13:1:4:22\\. They (the ish _t_ is 3) belong to Savit _ri_ ; for Savit _ri_ is\nthis (earth): if any one hides himself thereon, if any one goes elsewhere 4,\nit is on this\n\np. 285\n\n[paragraph continues] (earth) that they find him; for no one (creature),\nwhether walking erect or horizontally (like an animal), is able to go beyond\nit. Their belonging to Savit _ri_ thus is in order to find the horse.\n\n13:1:4:33\\. Concerning this they say, 'Surely the horse disappears when it\ngoes straight away; for they do not turn (drive) it back 1.' Now when he\nperforms the Dh _ri_ ti offerings 2 in the evening--dh _ri_ ti (keeping)\nmeaning peaceful dwelling, and the night also meaning peaceful dwelling--it is\nby means of peaceful dwelling that he keeps it; whence both men and beasts\nrest peacefully at night. And when he performs offerings in the morning, he\nseeks that (horse); whence it is in daytime that one goes to seek for what is\nlost. And again when he offers the Dh _ri_ tis in the evening, and the (Savit\n_ri_ ) ish _t_ is in the morning, it is security of possession the Sacrificer\nthereby brings about, whence security of possession is brought about for the\nsubjects where this sacrifice is performed.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[284:1](sbe44077.htm#fr_714) Or, as it might also be translated.
