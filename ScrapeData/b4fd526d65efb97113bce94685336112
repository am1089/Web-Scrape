The killer of a Brahma _n_ a is purified, if, having approached a river\n(and bathed in it), he restrains his breath sixteen times, and takes only one\nmeal, consisting of food fit for offerings, each day, for a month.\n\n3\\. At the end of this rite he must give a milch cow.\n\n4\\. By performing the same rite and by muttering (while standing in the water)\nthe Aghamarsha _n_ a[1] (instead of stopping his breath), a drinker of\nspirituous liquor[2] becomes free from sin.\n\n5\\. (By performing the same rite and) muttering the Gayatri one thousand and\nten times (each day), a stealer of gold becomes free from guilt.\n\n6\\. One who has connection with a Guru\'s wife[1] (becomes free from sin) by\nfasting for three days and muttering the Purushasukta[2] and (at the same\ntime) offering a burnt-oblation.\n\n7\\. Even as the horse-sacrifice, the king of sacrifices, removes all sin, the\nhymn of Aghamarsha _n_ a likewise removes all sin.\n\n8\\. Let a twice-born man stop his breath, in order to rid himself of all sin;\nall sins committed by a\n\n[2. Nand. infers from a text of Manu (XI, 249), that this rule refers to one\nwho has killed a Brahma _n_ a intentionally.\n\n3\\. This rule, Nand. infers from a passage of Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya (III, 305),\napplies also to the penances mentioned in the following Sutra.\n\n4\\. 1 Rig-veda X, 190.--2 \'I. e. one who has knowingly drunk it, the penance\nfor drinking it unknowingly being stated by Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya (III, 304).\'\n(Nand.)\n\n5, 6. 1 Nand. infers from M. XI, 251, 252, that these two Sutras also refer to\npenances for crimes intentionally committed.--2 Rig-veda X, 90.]\n\np. 182\n\ntwice-born man may be removed by repeated Pra _n_ ayamas.\n\n9\\. It is called a Pra _n_ ayama, if a man, stopping the breath (which comes\nfrom the mouth and from the nostrils), recites the Gayatri three times,\ntogether with the Vyah _ri_ tis (\'words\')[1], with the sacred syllable Om, and\nwith the (text called) _S_ iras[2].\n\n10\\. The lord of creatures (Brahman) has milked out from the three Vedas the\nletter A, the letter U, and the letter M (of which the sacred syllable Om is\ncomposed), and (the three sacred words) Bhu _h_ , Bhuva _h_ , Sva _h_ (earth,\nthe atmosphere, and heaven).\n\n11\\. The lord of creatures, the supreme deity, has also milked out from the\nthree Vedas successively the three verses of the sacred stanza which begins\nwith the word \'tad,\' and is called Savitri (or Gayatri).\n\n12\\. By muttering, every morning and evening, that syllable and that stanza,\npreceded by the three \'words,\' a Brahma _n_ a will obtain that religious merit\nwhich the (study of the) Veda confers, just as if he had actually studied the\nVeda.\n\n13\\. By repeating those three (Om, the \'words,\' and the Gayatri every day) for\na month out of the village, a thousand times, a twice-born man is purified\neven from a mortal sin, as a snake (is freed) from its withered skin.\n\n14\\. Any member of the Brahma _n_ a, Kshatriya, or Vai _s_ ya castes, who does\nnot know those three texts,\n\n[9. 1 The three Vyah _ri_ tis, \'words,\' or Mahavyah _ri_ tis, \'great words,\'\nare quoted in the next _S_ loka.--2 It begins with the words, \'O ye waters,\nwho are splendour and ambrosia.\' (Nand., and Mitakshara on Y. I, 23.)]\n\np. 183\n\nor fails to recite them in the proper season, meets with reproach among the\nvirtuous.\n\n15\\. The three imperishable \'great words,\' preceded by the syllable Om, and\nthe Gayatri consisting of three divisions, have to be recognised as the mouth\n(or beginning) of the Veda[1].\n\n16\\. He who repeats that stanza (preceded by the syllable Om and the three\n\'words\') carefully every day for three years, will be absorbed in the highest\nBrahman after death, move as freely as air, and become as pure as air.\n\n17\\. The monosyllable (Om) is the highest Brahman, the stoppings of the breath\nare the best of austerities, but nothing is more exalted than the Gayatri;\n(declaring the) truth is better than silence.\n\n18\\. All religious acts ordained in the Veda, (whether) consisting in burnt-\noblations or sacrifices (or alms-giving or other pious observances), perish\n(after the merit obtained by them has been exhausted); but the syllable Om\n(akshara) must be known to be imperishable (akshara), as it is identical with\nBrahman, the lord of creatures.\n\n19\\. The act of reciting (the syllable Om, the \'words,\' and the Gayatri) is\nten times better than the (Gyotish _t_ oma or other) sacrifices prescribed (by\nthe Veda); it is a hundred times better when muttered in a low voice; it is a\nthousand times better when repeated mentally only.\n\n20\\. The four Pakaya _g_ \xc3\xb1as[1] (small or domestic\n\n[15. \'To explain this, Nand. quotes a passage of \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana (G _ri_ hya-\nsutra III, 2, 3, where, however, part only of this quotation is found) to the\neffect that the study of the Veda has to be begun by pronouncing Om, the\n\'words,\' and the Gayatri.\n\n20\\. 1 \'The four Pakaya _g_ \xc3\xb1as are the offerings to gods, goblins (or "all\nbeings,"), manes, and men, together with the offering to {footnote p. 184}\nBrahman.\' (Nand.; see LIX, 20-25.) Kulluka, on the contrary (on M. II, 86),\nrefers the term Pakaya _g_ \xc3\xb1a to the four first only out of those five\nofferings, and this interpretation, besides being more simple than Nand.\'s, is\npreferable for several other reasons. First, the \'offering to Brahman\'\nincludes the daily recitation of the Gayatri, which is mentioned here as\nopposed to the four Pakaya _g_ \xc3\xb1as. Secondly, the number of four Pakaya _g_\n\xc3\xb1as is equally given in the Ka _th_ aka G _ri_ hya-sutra; and Devapala, in his\nCommentary on that work, gives a definition of them, which agrees in the main\nwith Kulluka\'s. \'Four\' Pakaya _g_ \xc3\xb1as are mentioned in the G _ri_ hya-sutras\nof Kau _s_ ika, Paraskara, and _S_ a _n_ khayana also. See Weber, Ind. Stud.\nX, 48. Thirdly, the Pakaya _g_ \xc3\xb1as are brought in here as opposed to the\nVidhiya _g_ \xc3\xb1as or \'sacrifices prescribed by the Veda.\' This is probably\nbecause the latter are offered in the triad of sacred fires, whereas the term\nPakaya _g_ \xc3\xb1a, in its narrower use, denotes the oblations offered in the\ndomestic fire. Hence, it might come to include the \'offering to men,\' i. e.\nthe feeding of a guest, but certainly not the study of the Veda.]\n\np. 184\n\nofferings), together with the sacrifices prescribed (in the Veda), though all\nunited, are not equal to a sixteenth part of the sacrifice performed by\nreciting (those sacred prayers).\n\n21\\. A Brahmana may beyond doubt obtain final emancipation by solely repeating\n(those prayers), whether he perform any other religious observance or no; one\nwho is benevolent towards all creatures (and does not slay them for\nsacrifices) is justly, called a Brahma _n_ a (or one united to Brahman).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: LVI.](sbe07058.htm)\n\n'
