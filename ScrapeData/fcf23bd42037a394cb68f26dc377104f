Now when Varu _n_ a was consecrated, his lustre departed from him,\n--lustre means vigour: that Vish _n_ u, the Sacrifice, it was he that departed\nfrom him,--probably that collected essence of the waters wherewith he is\nanointed on that occasion, drove out his lustre.\n\n5:4:5:22\\. He stole after it with those deities 1,--with Savit _ri_ , the\nimpeller (prasavit _ri_ ); with Sarasvati, speech; with Tvash _t_ _ri_ , the\nforms of being; with Pushan, cattle; with Indra, on the part of him 2 (the\nSacrificer); with B _ri_ haspati, holiness; with Varu _n_ a, might; with Agni,\nfiery spirit; with Soma, the King;\n\np. 114\n\n[paragraph continues] \\--but only through Vish _n_ u 1, the tenth deity, he\nfound it.\n\n5:4:5:33\\. And because he there stole after (anu-sam-s _ri_ p) with those\ndeities, hence the name Sa _m_ s _ri_ pa _h_. And because he becomes\nconsecrated on the tenth day, therefore (this ceremony is called) Da _s_ apeya\n2. And because each time ten (men) steal along 3 after each cup, therefore\nalso it is called Da _s_ apeya.\n\n5:4:5:44\\. Here now they say,--\'Let him steal forth after enumerating ten\nSoma-drinking grandfathers 4: it is thus that he obtains for himself the Soma-\ndraught of this (Da _s_ apeya), for it is a "drinking of ten."\' But that is an\noverburdening 5, for people (will\n\np. 115\n\nbe able to) obtain only two or three Soma-drinking grandfathers: hence let him\nsteal forth after enumerating those same deities 1.\n\n5:4:5:55\\. For, surely, it was by those same deities that Varu _n_ a obtained\nthe Soma-draught of that (Consecration-ceremony); and in like manner does this\none now obtain the Soma-draught of that (ceremony): let him therefore steal\nforth after enumerating those same deities. Now as soon as the completing\noblation 2 of that Consecration-ceremony comes to an end,--\n\n5:4:5:66\\. He prepares those (sa _m_ s _ri_ p) oblations,--a cake on twelve,\nor eight, potsherds for Savit _ri_ ; for Savit _ri_ is the impeller of the\ngods: impelled by Savit _ri_ , Varu _n_ a on that occasion stole along; and in\nlike manner does this one now steal along impelled by Savit _ri_. At this\n(oblation) he presents one lotus-flower 3.\n\n5:4:5:77\\. He then prepares a (rice) pap for Sarasvati,--for Sarasvati is\nspeech, and it was with speech that Varu _n_ a on that occasion stole along;\nand in like manner does this one now steal along with speech. At this\n(oblation) he presents one lotus-flower.\n\n5:4:5:88\\. He then prepares a cake on ten potsherds for Tvash _t_ _ri_ ,--for\nTvash _t_ _ri_ (the fashioner, creator) rules over living forms, and with\nTvash _t_ _ri_ , the living forms, Varu _n_ a on that occasion stole along;\nand in\n\np. 116\n\nlike manner does this one now steal along with Tvash _t_ _ri_ , the living\nforms. At this (oblation) he presents one lotus-flower.\n\n5:4:5:99\\. He then prepares a pap for Pushan;--for Pushan is cattle, and with\ncattle Varu _n_ a on that occasion stole along; and in like manner does this\none now steal along with cattle. At this (oblation) he presents one lotus-\nflower.\n\n5:4:5:1010\\. He then prepares a cake on eleven potsherds for Indra;--for\nIndriya means energy, vigour, and with vigour Varu _n_ a on that occasion\nstole along; and in like manner does this one now steal along with energy,\nwith vigour. At this (oblation) he presents one lotus-flower.\n\n5:4:5:1111\\. He then prepares a pap for B _ri_ haspati;--for B _ri_ haspati\nmeans holiness, and with holiness Varu _n_ a on that occasion stole along; and\nin likes manner does this one now steal along with holiness. At this\n(oblation) he presents one lotus-flower.\n\n5:4:5:1212\\. He then prepares a barley pap for Varu _n_ a;--with what\nvehemence Varu _n_ a seized the creatures, with that vehemence Varu _n_ a on\nthat occasion stole along; and in like manner does this one now steal along\nwith vehemence. At this (oblation) he presents one lotus-flower.\n\n5:4:5:1313\\. The deities of the Upasad are the (eighth, ninth, and) tenth 1.\nAt these (oblations) he presents\n\np. 117\n\nfive lotus-flowers. That wreath of twelve lotus-flowers he puts on himself;\nthat is the initiation: by that initiation he initiates himself.\n\n5:4:5:1414\\. And as to why there are twelve (flowers),--there being twelve\nmonths in the year, and the year being All, it is by the All that he thus\ninitiates him: what flowers there are of the lotus, they are a form (an image)\nof the sky, they are a form of the stars; and what seed-stalks there are, they\nare a form of the air; and what suckers there are, they are a form of this\n(earth): thus he initiates him (to rule) over these worlds.\n\n5:4:5:1515\\. And having bought the King (Soma) 1, and\n\np. 118\n\ntied him up in two parts, they drive him around. Having then placed one-half\non the throne-seat, he proceeds therewith. Having then placed on the throne-\nseat that portion which was deposited in the Brahman\'s house, he proceeds with\nthe guest-meal. Whilst he is proceeding with the guest-meal, he performs the\nUpasads. Whilst he is performing the Upasads,--\n\n5:4:5:1616\\. He prepares those (three) oblations,--a cake on eight potsherds\nfor Agni; a pap for Soma; and a cake on three potsherds, or a pap, for Vish\n_n_ u. Thus he performs the sacrifice in this way, if it pleases him.\n\n5:4:5:1717\\. But let him not do it in this way; for he who departs from the\npath of the sacrifice stumbles, and he who departs from the path of the\nUpasads certainly departs from the path of the sacrifice: let him therefore\nnot depart from the path of the Upasads.\n\n5:4:5:1818\\. Now when he offers to Agni, he steals along with Agni, with fiery\nspirit; and when he offers to Soma, he steals along with Soma, the King; and\nwhen he offers to Vish _n_ u,--Vish _n_ u being the sacrifice,--he visibly\nobtains the sacrifice, and having visibly obtained it, he makes it his own\n(or, takes it in).\n\n5:4:5:1919\\. This same (Da _s_ apeya) is an Agnish _t_ oma sacrifice\n(performed) with the seventeenfold (stoma) 1 for Pra _g_ apati is\nseventeenfold, and Pra _g_ apati is the\n\np. 119\n\nsacrifice 1: thus he visibly obtains the sacrifice, and having visibly\nobtained it, he makes it his own.\n\n5:4:5:2020\\. Twelve heifers with first calf are the sacrificial fee for this\n(sacrifice); for twelve months there are in the year, and the year is Pra _g_\napati, and Pra _g_ apati is the sacrifice: thus he visibly obtains the\nsacrifice, and having visibly obtained it, he makes it his own.\n\n5:4:5:2121\\. These (heifers) have twelve embryo calves,--that makes twenty-\nfour; for twenty-four half-moons there are in the year, and the year is Pra\n_g_ apati, and Pra _g_ apati is the sacrifice: thus he visibly obtains the\nsacrifice, and having visibly obtained it, he makes it his own.\n\n5:4:5:2222\\. He gives them to the Brahman, for the Brahman guards the\nsacrifice from the south: therefore he gives them to the Brahman. To the Udgat\n_ri_ (chanter) he gives the gold wreath, to the Hot _ri_ the gold plate, to\nthe two Adhvaryus two golden mirrors, to the Prastot _ri_\n([presenter](errata.htm#10)) a horse, to the Maitravaru _n_ a a sterile cow,\nto the Brahma _n_ a _kh_ a _m_ sin a bull, to the Nesh _t_ _ri_ and Pot _ri_\ntwo garments, to the A _kh_ avaka (a cart) laden with barley, and yoked (with\nan ox) on one side, to the Agnidh an ox 2.\n\n5:4:5:2323\\. Now there are here either twelve or thirteen 3 presents,--for\neither twelve or thirteen are there months in the year, and the year is Pra\n_g_ apati, and Pra _g_ apati is the sacrifice: thus he visibly obtains the\nsacrifice, and having visibly obtained it he makes it his own.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[113:1](sbe4122.htm#fr_220) In the Black Ya _g_ us ritual the order of deities\nto whom the \'sa _m_ s _ri_ pa _m_ havi _m_ shi\' are offered is as follows,--\nAgni, Sarasvati, Savit _ri_ , Pushan, B _ri_ haspati, Indra, Varu _n_ a, Soma,\nTvash _t_ _ri_ , Vish _n_ u. Cf. Taitt. S. I, 8, 17; Taitt. Br. I, 8, 1.\n\n[113:2](sbe4122.htm#fr_221) Or, with Indra, for (the lost vigour) itself.\nHardly, \'for us.\' The Ka _n_ va text has \'indre _n_ asmai,\' and so Saya _n_ a\n(MS. I. O. 657): asmai apas _ri_ taya viryaya tadadhinakara _n_ artham indre\n_n_ a; yad va vibhaktivyatyaya _h_ , anena virye _n_ a viryavata indre _n_ a.\n\n[114:1](sbe4122.htm#fr_222) It seems rather strange that Varu _n_ a and Vish\n_n_ u should be included amongst the deities, with whose help Varu _n_ a\nsought to recover his vigour, or Vish _n_ u the sacrifice; but--\'Twere to\nconsider too curiously, to consider so.\n\n[114:2](sbe4122.htm#fr_223) That is, da _s_ a (ten) and peya (drink,\nbeverage).\n\n[114:3](sbe4122.htm#fr_224) For an explanation of the noiseless mode of moving\nwith bent bodies, called sarpa _n_ am, \'creeping,\' see part ii, pp. 299, 450.\nIt is in this way they are to move when they betake themselves to the\nrespective fire-places for performing the sa _m_ s _ri_ p oblations; as they\nalso do when betaking themselves to the Sadas to drink the cups of Soma at the\nSoma-feast on the next day. When libations of Soma-juice are made from the ten\ncups ( _k_ amasa, see part ii, p. 287), each cup is to be followed by ten\nBrahmans who then take part in consuming the liquor in the Sadas--there being\nthus altogether one hundred Brahmans taking part in these potations. The\ncontents of the Sacrificer\'s cup, on the other hand, may be drunk by ten Ra\n_g_ anyas (i.e. himself and nine others). See Katy. XV, 8, 18-20; Taitt. S.,\nvol. ii, p. 179.\n\n[114:4](sbe4122.htm#fr_225) Saya _n_ a takes this literally as meaning that he\nis to call out the name of the Sacrificer\'s grandfather, then the grandfather\nof that one and so on. The commentary on Katy. XV, 8, 16, on the other hand,\napparently takes it to mean ten forefathers of the Sacrificer who have\nperformed Soma-sacrifices, from the grandfather upwards.\n\n[114:5](sbe4122.htm#fr_226) That is, an excessive demand, or, a weighing down,\nor crushing of the Sacrificer, making it impossible for him to perform the\nceremony at all.\n\n[115:1](sbe4122.htm#fr_227) That is to say, after pronouncing the mantra, Va\n_g_. S. X, 30. agreeing partly with [paragraph 2](sbe4122.htm#5:4:5:2) above,\nviz. beginning, \'By Savit _ri_ , the impeller; by Sarasvati, speech,\' . . .\nand ending, \'by Vish _n_ u, the tenth deity, impelled I steal forth.\'\n\n[115:2](sbe4122.htm#fr_228) For the Udavasaniya ish _t_ i, see part ii, p.\n389.\n\n[115:3](sbe4122.htm#fr_229) The lotus-flowers presented on this occasion are\ngold ones, according to Saya _n_ a, or optionally ordinary white or gold ones,\naccording to Katy. XV, 8, 5-6.\n\n[116:1](sbe4122.htm#fr_230) For the Upasad, or preliminary oblations of ghee\nto Agni, Soma, and Vish _n_ u, to be performed twice daily for (usually) three\ndays preceding an ordinary Soma-sacrifice, see part ii, p. 104. At the Da _s_\napeya, the ten Sa _m_ s _ri_ p-oblations take as it were the place of the\nordinary Upasads, the latter being performed on the last three preliminary\ndays along with, and to the same deities as, the last three Sa _m_ s _ri_\np-oblations; or, according to some authorities, p. 117 being substituted for\nthem. There seems also some difference of opinion as to the exact time when\nthe other preliminary ceremonies--the procession and entrance of king Soma,\nthe guest-meal, &c.--are to take place, see [paragraph\n15](sbe4122.htm#5:4:5:15).--According to Katy. XV, 8,14, these ceremonies are\nto take place on the seventh day (which the commentator, however, takes to\nmean the seventh day of the light fortnight of _K_ aitra; the first seven Sa\n_m_ s _ri_ p-oblations being, according to him, performed on the day before).\nThe Ka _n_ vas, however, perform these offerings on separate days.--The\nTaittiriya authorities seem also to be at variance with each other as to the\nexact relation of the Upasads and the last three Sa _m_ s _ri_ p-oblations,\nthe deities of the two being, according to their scheme, only partly\nidentical. According to \xc3\x82pastamba (and Taitt. Br.) the first seven Sa _m_ s\n_ri_ ps are performed on so many days and, moreover, one Diksha on the seventh\nday. Then on the last three days the Sa _m_ s _ri_ ps and Upasads are combined\nin this way, that the eighth day\'s Sa _m_ s _ri_ p is performed previous to,\nthe ninth between, the tenth after the two daily Upasad-performances.--Each of\nthe ten oblations also requires a special set of fires for its performance,\nthe first being laid down immediately north of the one used for the Abhishe\n_k_ aniya ceremony, the second immediately north of the first, &c.; the last\nSa _m_ s _ri_ p-oblation being performed in the fire-shed ( _s_ ala) of the Da\n_s_ apeya proper. Katy. XV, 8, 2-3; cf. Taitt. S., vol. ii, p. 176.\n\n[117:1](sbe4122.htm#fr_231) Namely, at the beginning of the Abhishe _k_ aniya,\nor Consecration-ceremony, when Soma-plants are purchased sufficient to last p.\n118 for both that ceremony and the succeeding Da _s_ apeya; the portion\ndestined for the latter ceremony being meanwhile deposited in the Brahman\'s\nhouse.\n\n[118:1](sbe4122.htm#fr_232) All the chants (stotra) of the Da _s_ apeya are to\nbe executed in the seventeenfold mode of chanting, or Saptada _s_ a-stoma; for\nan example of which see part ii, p. 315, note 1.\n\n[119:1](sbe4122.htm#fr_233) See [p. 8](sbe4104.htm#page_8), note\n*[1](sbe4104.htm#fn_39)*.\n\n[119:2](sbe4122.htm#fr_234) The text has \'gam agnidhe,\' i.e. either \'a bull,\'\nor \'a cow.\' So also Katy. XV. 8, 27. Saya _n_ a, however, refers to another\nauthority,--ana _d_ vaham agnidha iti sutritam, . . . vahnir va ana _d_ van\niti hi taittiriyakam.\n\n[119:3](sbe4122.htm#fr_235) That is, according to Saya _n_ a, counting the\nunborn calves.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 5, 1.
