The benefit to man results from thence, on account of scriptural\nstatement; thus Badaraya _n_ a thinks.\n\nWe have concluded the investigation into the oneness or diverseness of\nmeditations--the result of which is to indicate in which cases the special\npoints mentioned in several meditations have to be combined, and in which not.\nA further point now to be investigated is whether that advantage to the\nmeditating devotee, which is held to accrue to him from the meditation,\nresults from the meditation directly, or from works of which the meditations\nare subordinate members.--The Reverend Badaraya _n_ a holds the former view.\nThe benefit to man results from thence, i.e. from the meditation, because\nScripture declares this to be so. 'He who knows Brahman reaches the Highest'\n(Taitt. Up. II, 1, 1); 'I know that great Person of sun-like lustre beyond the\ndarkness. A man who knows him truly passes over death; there is no other path\nto go' ( _S_ vet. Up. III, 8); 'As the flowing rivers disappear in the sea,\nlosing their name and their form, thus a man who possesses knowledge, freed\nfrom name and form, goes to the divine Person who is greater than the great'\n(Mu.
