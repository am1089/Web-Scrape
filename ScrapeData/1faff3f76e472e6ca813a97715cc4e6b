For this very reason (there are applied to Brahman) comparisons such as\nthat of the images of the sun and the like.\n\nBecause that Self is of the nature of intelligence, devoid of all difference,\ntranscending speech and mind, to be\n\np. 158\n\ndescribed only by denying of it all other characteristics, therefore the\nMoksha _S_ astras compare it to the images of the sun reflected in the water\nand the like, meaning thereby that all difference in Brahman is unreal, only\ndue to its limiting conditions. Compare, e.g. out of many, the two following\npassages: 'As the one luminous sun when entering into relation to many\ndifferent waters is himself rendered multiform by his limiting adjuncts; so\nalso the one divine unborn Self;' and 'The one Self of all beings separately\nabides in all the individual beings; hence it appears one and many at the same\ntime, just as the one moon is multiplied by its reflections in the water.'\n\nThe next Sutra raises an objection.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2, 19](sbe38122.htm)\n\n"
