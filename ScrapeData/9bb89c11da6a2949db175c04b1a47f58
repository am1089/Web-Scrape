Your word must be obeyed by me; now I\ndesire to see, as you say, the kingdom of Janaka; kindly give me permission. O\nfather! Again the doubt is coming within me how the king Janaka is governing\nhis kingdom without sentencing any body? And if there be no punishment within\nhis kingdom, no one will remain in the path of virtue. It is for the sake of\npreserving religion that Manu and the other sages have always prescribed for\npunishment; how, then, religion can be preserved without inflicting\npunishment. O Mahabhaga! What you have spoken to me appears to me true like\nthe sentence \xc2\x93My mother is barren.\xc2\x94 So, O destroyer of foes! Permit and I will\nstart for Mi _t_ hila. Seeing the greatly wise son S\xc2\x92uka, void of any desires,\nearnestly anxious to go to Mi _t_ hila, gave him a cordial embrace and said\n:-- \xc2\x93O highly intelligent son S\xc2\x92uka! Peace be on you! Have a long life. O\nchild! Speak truly before me and go. O son! Say that after going to Mi _t_\nhila you will come back again to this \xc3\x82s'rama; never that you will go anywhere\nelse. O son! Seeing the lotus face of yours, I am passing my days happily; if\nI do not see you, I will suffer extreme pain. What more than this, that you\nare my life and soul. I am saying, therefore, after seeing Janaka and clearing\nyour doubts come here again and remain at peace, and study on the Vedas.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\np. 61\n\n\n\nVyasa having spoken thus, S\xc2\x92uka bowed down and circumambulated his most\nworshipful father, and went out; he began to walk very fast like an arrow,\nleaving the bow, and when it has left the bow. On his journey he saw various\ncountries, various classes of persons, earning money, various gardens and\nforests, various trees; in some places he saw fields with green grains and\ngrains standing on them; at others he saw ascetics practising asceticism, and\ninitiated Yajniks (performing yaj\xc3\xb1as, or sacrifices); in some places he saw\nyogis practising yoga, the high-souled Vanaprasthis (in the third stage of\nlife) residing in the forest, and at others he saw devotees of S'iva, S\xc2\x92akti,\nGa _n_ es'a, Surya and Vi _sn_ u and many others. Thus he went on in his\njourney, in great wonder, towards his destination. In his passage he crossed\nMeru in two years and the Mount Himalayas in one year and then reached the\ncity Mi _t_ hila. Going there he found the place, full of wealth, corn,\ngrains, etc., and all prosperities and the people were all very happy and they\nobserved the rule of conduct as in the S'astras. When he was about to enter\ninto the city the guard in front of the gate stopped him, asking \xc2\x93Who are you?\nSir. What for are you come here?\xc2\x94 When the guard asked him thus, he replied\nnothing and went away to a distance and with great wonder could not help\nlaughing in his mind and remained motionless like a statue. At this the guard\nsaid :-- \xc2\x93O Brahman! Why have you remained silent? Kindly say what for you\nhave come here? I know this well that no body goes anywhere without having\nsomething to do? The king has forbidden strangers whose parentage and\ncharacter are unknown. Therefore O Brahmin! Every one has to take the king's\npermission before he goes into the city.\n\n\n\nIt seems that you are a very energetic Brahman and that you know the Vedas; so\nO giver of honour! speak out to me your object-in-view and go into the city as\nyou like.\xc2\x94 Hearing these words of the guard, S\xc2\x92uka Deva began to say :-- \xc2\x93I\nhave come to see the city of Videha Janaka; but now I see that persons like me\nfind great difficulty to enter here; so O Gatekeeper! I have got the answer\nfrom you. I was a great fool that I was so much deluded that to see the king I\ncrossed many countries and over topped the two mountains and have come here. O\nMahabhaga! What blame can I put on others? It is my father that has deluded\nme; or my karma done in my previous birth is now making me wander about. Alas!\nIn this world greed for money is the sole cause to make a man knock about; but\nI have not got that even; my erroneous idea has brought me so far. I now\nrealise that a man, having no desires, gets constant happiness if he be not\nplunged in the net of delusion; else he cannot have any such. O Mahabhaga!\nThough I have no desire of anything, yet I am\n\n\n\np. 62\n\n\n\nplunged in the sea of Moha. Alas! Where is Meru? and where is Mi _t_ hila (a\ngreat distance intervenes) I have walked so great a distance on foot; alas!\nthis is this the result of my so long a journey! Therefore I am thoroughly\nconvinced that the Creator has deceived me. One must have to suffer for his\nPrarabdha karma, be it auspicious or inauspicious. One must make one\xc2\x92s effort,\nbeing always under the control of this Law of Karma. Though there be no\napparent desire or cause, yet this Prarabdha Karma always puts a man into\ndifferent actions.\n\n\n\nThis place is not a Tirath (holy place) nor there are the Vedas personified\nhere, that I have taken so much pains and trouble to come here -- only there\nis one thing here and that is the king Janaka; but there is no chance to see\nhim even; for I have not been able to enter even within his kingdom.\xc2\x94 Thus\nsaying, S\xc2\x92uka remained silent and began to stay as one who has taken the vow\nto remain silent. The guard then took him to be a very wise Brahman and spoke\nin sweet words :-- \xc2\x93O Brahman! Go to the place, as you like, where you have\ngot your work. O Brahman! I stopped you; so please excuse me for any offence\nincurred by me. Free persons like you have mercy alone as their greatest\nstrength.\xc2\x94 Hearing this S\xc2\x92uka Deva said :--What is your fault? you are\ndependent on another; the servant ought to obey the words of his master and\nserve him by all means; and there is no fault of the king, too, in your not\nallowing me to enter; for the wise persons ought to ascertain by all means,\nwhether the new comers are enemies or thieves? Hence when I am quite a\nstranger suddenly come to this place, that the fault is wholly mine. Every\nperson knows that it is lowering oneself to go to another's house. The guard\nthen said :-- \xc2\x93O great Brahman! what is happiness? and what is pain? what\nought to be done to by your well wisher? who is your enemy? and who is your\nbenefactor? Now advise me on all these points.\xc2\x94 Hearing this S\xc2\x92uka Deva said\n:-- Everywhere men are divided, as far as their internal natures are\nconcerned, into two classes; they are called attached or unattached. And the\nminds of these two classes are again of two kinds. The \xc2\x93attached\xc2\x94 man is\nstupid and cunning and the \xc2\x93unattached\xc2\x94 is sub-divided into three classes\nknowing, unknowing and middling. The cunning man is divided again into two\nclasses :-- Whether his cunningness is according to the dictates of S\xc2\x92astras\nor arising from his intellect. Again intellect is sub-divided into two whether\nit is Yukta (one-pointed) or Ayukta (Diverted) The guard spoke :-- \xc2\x93O Learned\none! I cannot understand what you say; so explain them to me what they mean.\xc2\x94\nS\xc2\x92uka Deva said :-- Those who are attached to this world are said to be\n\xc2\x93attached\xc2\x94 persons. These attached persons feel frequently various pleasures\nand pains. When they get wives, sons, wealth, honour, rise, etc., they get\npleasures; and if they\n\n\n\np. 63\n\n\n\ndo not get any of these they feel at every moment intense pain. Now the\nattached person sought to take such means as will secure them the pleasures of\nthis world; so whoever acts against those means are denominated as breakers of\ntheir happiness and so they are enemies; and whoever aids in their acquiring\npleasures are denominated as their friends. Of these the attached but at the\nsame time cunning man does not get confounded and bewildered by them; whereas\nstupid attached man gets always bewildered everywhere. The man that is\ndispassionate and engaged in determining the \xc2\x93self\xc2\x94 dwells in a solitary\nplace, meditates on \xc2\x93self\xc2\x94, finds pleasure in studying the Vedanta S\xc2\x92astras\nand feels pain in all the topics on worldly affairs. The wise man that wants\nhis real welfare and is averse to the worldly enjoyments finds that he has\nmany enemies; lust, anger, palaces, etc., are his so many enemies. Contentment\nis his only friend in the three lokas and no one is his real self.\n\n\n\nHearing these words of S\xc2\x92uka Deva, the watchman considered S\xc2\x92uka Deva a very\nwise man and soon led him to a very beautiful compartment. S\xc2\x92uka Deva then\nbegan to see that the town was full of three sorts of men, good, middling, and\nbad; and the shops were filled with various articles of merchandise. The many\nthings were being incessantly purchased and sold there. Within that town,\nfilled with many men, money and all sorts wealth and prosperities, almost\neverywhere were seen instances of attachment, hatred, lust, anger, greed,\nvanity and delusion; at some parts there were seen persons quarrelling with\neach other. Seeing thus the three sorts of persons, the highly energetic\nS\xc2\x92uka, blazing like a second Sun went to the royal palace when the gateman\nstopped him. He stood there like a log of wood and began to meditate on\n\xc2\x93Moksa\xc2\x94 (Liberation). He began to think the light and darkness as same; the\ngreatly ascetic S\xc2\x92uka became merged in Dhyana (meditation) and remained at one\nplace motionless. In an instant, a royal minister came out and saluting him\nwith folded hands, took him to a second compartment. Here the minister showed\nhim beautiful divine gardens adorned nicely with rows of divine trees bearing\nfruits and gave him a good reception and took him to a very beautiful palace.\nThe minister next ordered the public women in royal service, expert in music\nand playing with instruments, and skilled in Kama-S\xc2\x92astra (the science of\namorous dealings) to attend on S\xc2\x92uka Deva and went out of the palace. S\xc2\x92uka,\nthe son of Vyasa, remained there. Those prostitutes then prepared various\ndishes, suited to the time and place, and sought the satisfaction of S\xc2\x92uka and\nthen worshipped him duly with greatest devotion. Those ladies, then, residing\nwithin the four walls became enamoured to see the beauty of S\xc2\x92uka Deva and\nshowed him the gardens that existed in the inner compound. S\xc2\x92uka was young and\nbeautiful; over this he was extremely lovely, of nice limbs; his speech was\nsoft\n\n\n\np. 64\n\n\n\nand gentle; so he looked like a second Cupid (the god of love); all the\nladies, struck with Cupid\xc2\x92s arrows, lost their consciousness. Then recovering,\nthey considered S\xc2\x92uka Deva to be the great controller of passions and began to\nserve him with great care. The pure minded S\xc2\x92uka, born of Ara _n_ i, looked on\nthem like his mother. S\xc2\x92uka, finding pleasure in self and the controller of\nanger was not pleased or displeased with anything; so though be saw that the\nladies were disturbed with amorous feelings, he remained quite undisturbed,\ncalm and quiet. The ladies, then prepared a very nice bed whereon S\xc2\x92uka Deva\nwould sleep; it was spread over with nice clean bed sheet; many nice pillows\nwere placed. He, then, washed his feet and with vigilance, put on his finger\nthe ring prepared of Kus'a grass, and completing his evening Sandhya, became\nmerged in Dhyana. Meditating on Supreme Brahma for three hours (one Prahara),\nslept for 6 hours and getting up, again became merged in Brahma Dhyana for the\nlast three hours of the night. Then at the Brahma muhurta (one hour preceding\nthe sunrise) he took his bath and completing his morning duties, became\nimmersed in Samadhi (inner enlightenment) and sat at ease.\n\n\n\nThus ends the 17th chapter of the 1st Skandha on S\xc2\x92uka's displaying his self-\ncontrol amidst the women of the palace of Mi _t_ hila in the Mahapura _n_ a\nS\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 18](bk01ch18.htm)\n\n"
