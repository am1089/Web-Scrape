XXXIII.\n\nBan\xcc\x81a solicits \xc5\x9aiva for war: finds Aniruddha in the palace, and makes him\nprisoner. Krishn\xcc\x81a, Balarama, and Pradyumna come to his rescue \xc5\x9aiva and Skanda\naid Ban\xcc\x81a: the former is disabled; the latter put to flight. Ban\xcc\x81a encounters\nKrishn\xcc\x81a, who cuts off all his arms, and is about to put him to death. \xc5\x9aiva\nintercedes, and Krishn\xcc\x81a a spares his life. Vishn\xcc\x81u and \xc5\x9aiva are the same.\n\nBEFORE this took place, Ban\xcc\x81a had been engaged in the adoration of the three-\neyed god, and had thus prayed to him: "I am humiliated, O lord, by the\npossession of a thousand arms in a state of peace; let some hostilities ensue,\nin which I may derive some advantage from their possession. Without war, what\nis the use of these arms? they are but a burden to me." \xc5\x9aankara replied, "When\nthy peacock banner shall be broken, thou shalt have war, the delight of the\nevil spirits that feast on the flesh of man." Ban\xcc\x81a, pleased by this promise,\nproffered his thanks to \xc5\x9aambhu, and returned to his palace, where he found his\nstandard broken; at which his joy was increased.\n\nAt that time the nymph Chitralekha returned from Dwaraka, and by the exercise\nof her magic power brought Aniruddha along with her. The guards of the inner\napartments discovering him there with Usha, reported it to the king who\nimmediately sent a body of his followers to seize the prince; but the valiant\nyouth, taking up an iron club, slew his assailants: on which Ban\xcc\x81a mounted his\ncar, advanced against him, and endeavoured to put him to death. Finding,\nhowever, that Aniruddha was not to be subdued by prowess, he followed the\ncounsel of his minister, and brought his magical faculties into the conflict,\nby which he succeeded in capturing the Yadu prince, and binding him in serpent\nbonds.\n\nWhen Aniruddha was missed from Dwaravati, and the Yadavas were inquiring of\none another whither he had gone, Narada came to them, and told them that he\nwas the prisoner of Ban\xcc\x81a, having been conveyed by a female, possessed of\nmagic faculties, to \xc5\x9aon\xcc\x81itapura 1 When they heard\n\np. 594\n\nthis, they were satisfied; for they had imagined he had been taken away by the\ngods (in reprisal for the Parijata tree). Krishn\xcc\x81a therefore immediately\nsummoned Garud\xcc\x81a, who came with a wish; and mounting upon him, along with Bala\nand Pradyumna, he set off for the city of Ban\xcc\x81a. On their approach to the city\nthey were opposed by the spirits who attend on Rudra, but these were soon\ndestroyed by Hari, and he and his companions reached the vicinity of the town.\nHere mighty Fever, an emanation from Mahe\xc5\x9bwara, having three feet and three\nheads 2, fought desperately with Vishn\xcc\x81u in defence of Ban\xcc\x81a. Baladeva, upon\nwhom his ashes were scattered, was seized with burning heat, and his eyelids\ntrembled: but he obtained relief by clinging to the body of Krishn\xcc\x81a.\nContending thus with the divine holder of the bow, the Fever emanating from\n\xc5\x9aiva was quickly expelled from the person of Krishn\xcc\x81a by Fever which he\nhimself engendered. Brahma beholding the impersonated malady bewildered by the\nbeating inflicted by the arms of the deity, entreated the latter to desist;\nand the foe of Madhu refrained, and absorbed into himself the fever he had\ncreated. The rival Fever then departed, saying to Krishn\xcc\x81a, "Those men who\ncall to memory the combat between us shall be ever exempt from febrile\ndisease."\n\nNext Vishn\xcc\x81u overcame and demolished the five fires 3, and with perfect ease\nannihilated the army of the Danavas. Then the son of Bali (Ban\xcc\x81a),\n\np. 595\n\nwith the whole of the Daitya host, assisted by \xc5\x9aankara and Kartikeya, fought\nwith \xc5\x9aauri. A fierce combat took place between Hari and \xc5\x9aankara; all the\nregions shook, scorched by their flaming weapons, and the celestials felt\nassured that the end of the universe was at hand. Govinda, with the weapon of\nyawning, set \xc5\x9aankara a-gape; and then the demons and the demigods attendant\nupon \xc5\x9aiva were destroyed on every side; for Hara, overcome with incessant\ngaping, sat down in his car, and was unable longer to contend with Krishn\xcc\x81a,\nwhom no acts affect. The deity of war, Kartikeya, wounded in the arm by\nGarud\xcc\x81a, struck by the weapons of Pradyumna, and disarmed by the shout of\nHari, took to flight. Ban\xcc\x81a, when he saw \xc5\x9aankara disabled, the Daityas\ndestroyed, Guha fled, and \xc5\x9aiva\'s followers slain, advanced on his vast car,\nthe horses of which were harnessed by Nandi\xc5\x9ba, to encounter Krishn\xcc\x81a and his\nassociates Bala and Pradyumna. The valiant Balabhadra, attacking the host of\nBan\xcc\x81a, wounded them in many ways with his arrows, and put them to a shameful\nrout; and their sovereign beheld them dragged about by Rama with his\nploughshare, or beaten by him with his club, or pierced by Krishn\xcc\x81a with his\narrows: he therefore attacked Krishn\xcc\x81a, and a fight took place between them:\nthey cast at each other fiery shafts, that pierced through their armour; but\nKrishn\xcc\x81a intercepted with his arrows those of Ban\xcc\x81a, and cut them to pieces.\nBan\xcc\x81a nevertheless wounded Ke\xc5\x9bava, and the wielder of the discus wounded\nBan\xcc\x81a; and both desirous of victory, and seeking enraged the death of his\nantagonist, hurled various missiles at each other. When an infinite number of\narrows had been cut to pieces, and the weapons began to be exhausted, Krishn\xcc\x81a\nresolved to put Ban\xcc\x81a to death. The destroyer of the demon host therefore took\nup his discus Sudar\xc5\x9bana, blazing with the radiance of a hundred suns. As he\nwas in the act of casting it, the mystical goddess Kot\xcc\x81avi, the magic lore of\nthe demons, stood naked before him 4. Seeing her before him, Krishn\xcc\x81a, with\nunclosed eyes, cast\n\np. 596\n\n[paragraph continues] Sudar\xc5\x9bana, to cut off the arms of Ban\xcc\x81a. The discus,\ndreaded in its flight by the whole of the weapons of the demons, lopped off\nsuccessively the numerous arms of the Asura. Beholding Krishn\xcc\x81a with the\ndiscus again in his hand, and preparing to launch it once more, for the total\ndemolition of Ban\xcc\x81a, the foe of Tripura (\xc5\x9aiva) respectfully addressed him. The\nhusband of Uma, seeing the blood streaming from the dissevered arms of Ban\xcc\x81a,\napproached Govinda, to solicit a suspension of hostilities, and said to him,\n"Krishn\xcc\x81a, Krishn\xcc\x81a, lord of the world, I know thee, first of spirits, the\nsupreme lord, infinite felicity, without beginning or end, and beyond all\nthings. This sport of universal being, in which thou takest the persons of\ngod, animals, and men, is a subordinate attribute of thy energy. Be propitious\ntherefore, O lord, unto me. I have given Ban\xcc\x81a assurance of safety; do not\nthou falsify that which I have spoken. He has grown old in devotion to me; let\nhim not incur thy displeasure. The Daitya has received a boon from me, and\ntherefore I deprecate thy wrath." When he had concluded, Govinda, dismissing\nhis resentment against the Asura, looked graciously on the lord of Uma, the\nwielder of the trident, and said to him, "Since you, \xc5\x9aankara, have given a\nboon unto Ban\xcc\x81a, let him live: from respect to your promises, my discus is\narrested: the assurance of safety granted by you is granted also by me. You\nare fit to apprehend that you are not distinct from me. _That_ which I am,\nthou art; and _that_ also is this world, with its gods, demons, and mankind.\nMen contemplate distinctions, because they are stupified by ignorance." So\nsaying, Krishn\xcc\x81a went to the place where the son of Pradyumna was confined.\nThe snakes that bound him were destroyed, being blasted by the breath of\nGarud\xcc\x81a: and Krishn\xcc\x81a, placing him, along with his wife, upon the celestial\nbird, returned with Pradyumna and Rama to Dwaraka 4.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[593:1](vp150.htm#fr_1552) The synonymes of \xc5\x9aon\xcc\x81itapura in the Trikan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a\n\xc5\x9aesha are Devikot\xcc\x81a, Ban\xcc\x81apur, Kot\xcc\x81ivarsham, and Ushavana. The first is\nusually considered to be the modern Devicotta in the Carnatic, which is\ncommonly believed to be the scene of Ban\xcc\x81a\'s defeat. The name, however, occurs\nin other parts of India; in the Dekhin, on p. 594 the banks of the Godavari,\naccording to Wilford the capital of Munja (As. Res. IX. 199); and in Asam,\nnear Gwalpara, as the city of the Daityas. As. Res. XIV. 443 Hamilton notices\nthe remains of a city so called in Dinajpur. In the Kalika P., Ban\xcc\x81a is\ndescribed as the friend, and apparently neighbour, of Naraka, king of\nPragjyotish or Asam.\n\n[594:2](vp150.htm#fr_1553) Alluding to the three stages of febrile paroxysms,\nor to the recurrence of tertian ague. A contest with this enemy, in the course\nof military operations, is an allegory which the British armies in India too\noften illustrate.\n\n[594:3](vp150.htm#fr_1554) The \xc3\x81havaniya, Garhapatya, Dakshin\xcc\x81a, Sabhya, and\n\xc3\x81vasathya, are the five fires; of which the three first have a religious, and\nthe other two a secular character. The first is a fire prepared for oblations\nat an occasional sacrifice: the second is the household fire, to be\nperpetually maintained: the third is a sacrificial fire, in the centre of the\nother two, and placed to the south: the Sabhya is a fire lighted to warm a\nparty: and the \xc3\x81vasatthya the common domestic or culinary fire. Manu, III.\ntoo, 185, and Kulluka Bhat\xcc\x81t\xcc\x81a\'s explanation.\n\n[595:4](vp150.htm#fr_1555) Kot\xcc\x81avi is said to be an eighth portion of\nRudran\xcc\x81i, and the tutelary goddess of the Daityas, composed of incantations.\nThe Hari V. calls her also Lamba, and intimates her being the mother of Ban\xcc\x81a,\nand as identical with Durga. The word in the lexicons designates a naked\nwoman, and is thence applicable to Durga, in some of her forms.\n\n[596:4](vp150.htm#fr_1556) There can be little doubt that this legend\ndescribes a serious struggle between the \xc5\x9aaivas and Vaishn\xcc\x81avas, in which the\nlatter, according to their own report, were victorious; and the \xc5\x9aaivas,\nalthough they attempt to make out a sort of compromise between Rudra and\nKrishn\xcc\x81a, are obliged to admit his having the worst of the conflict, and his\ninability to protect his votary. The Bhagavata tells the story much as the\ntext. The Hari V. amplifies even more than usual, the narrative occupying\nnearly seventy pages of the French translation. The legend is to be found to\nthe same purport, but in various degrees of detail, in the Agni P., Kurma P.,\nPadma P. (Uttara Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a), Vamana P., and Brahma Vaivartta P. (Krishn\xcc\x81a Janma\nKhan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXXIV](vp151.htm)\n\n'
