'Consideration ( _k_ itta) 2 is better than will. For when a man\nconsiders, then he wills, then he thinks in his mind, then he sends forth\nspeech, and he\n\np. 114\n\nsends it forth in a name. In a name the sacred hymns are contained, in the\nsacred hymns all sacrifices.\n\n2\\. 'All these (beginning with mind and ending in sacrifice) centre in\nconsideration, consist of consideration, abide in consideration. Therefore if\na man is inconsiderate, even if he possesses much learning, people say of him,\nhe is nothing, whatever he may know; for, if he were learned, he would not be\nso inconsiderate. But if a man is considerate, even though he knows but\nlittle, to him indeed do people listen gladly. Consideration is the centre,\nconsideration is the self, consideration is the support of all these. Meditate\non consideration.\n\n3\\. 'He who meditates on consideration as Brahman, he, being himself safe,\nfirm, and undistressed, obtains the safe, firm, and undistressed worlds which\nhe has considered; he is, as it were, lord and master as far as consideration\nreaches--he who meditates on consideration as Brahman.'\n\n'Sir, is there something better than consideration?'\n\n'Yes, there is something better than consideration.'\n\n'Sir, tell it me.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[113:1](sbe01138.htm#fr_307) This paragraph is obscure. The text seems\ndoubtful, for instance, in samak _li_ patam, samakalpetam, and samakalpatam.\nThen the question is the exact meaning of sa _m_ k _li_ ptyai, which must be\ntaken as an instrumental case. What is intended is that, without rain, food is\nimpossible &c. or inconceivable; but the text says, 'By the will of rain food\nwills,' &c. Will seems almost to be taken here in the sense in which modern\nphilosophers use it, as a kind of creative will. By the will of rain food\nwills, would mean, that first rain wills and exists, and afterwards the vital\nairs will and exist, &c.\n\n[113:2](sbe01139.htm#fr_308) _K_ itta, thought, implies here consideration and\nreflection.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII, 6](sbe01140.htm)\n\n"
