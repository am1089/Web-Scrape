Pra _g_ apati brooded over the worlds, and from them thus brooded on he\nsqueezed out the essences, Agni (fire) from the earth, Vayu (air) from the\nsky, \xc3\x82ditya (the sun) from heaven.\n\n2\\. He brooded over these three deities, and from them thus brooded on he\nsqueezed out the essences, the _Ri_ _k_ verses from Agni, the Ya _g_ us verses\nfrom Vayu, the Saman verses from \xc3\x82ditya.\n\n3\\. He brooded over the threefold knowledge (the three Vedas), and from it\nthus brooded on he squeezed out the essences, the sacred interjection Bhus\nfrom the _Ri_ _k_ verses, the sacred interjection Bhuvas from the Ya _g_ us\nverses, the sacred interjection Svar from the Saman verses.\n\n4\\. If the sacrifice is injured from the Rig-Veda side, let him offer a\nlibation in the Garhapatya fire, saying, Bhu _h_ , Svaha! Thus does he bind\ntogether and heal, by means of the essence and the power of the _Ri_ _k_\nverses themselves, whatever break the _Ri_ _k_ sacrifice may have suffered.\n\n5\\. If the sacrifice is injured from the Ya _g_ ur-veda side, let him offer a\nlibation in the Dakshi _n_ a fire, saying, Bhuva _h_ , Svaha! Thus does he\nbind together and heal, by means of the essence and the power of the Ya _g_ us\nverses themselves, whatever break the Ya _g_ us sacrifice may have suffered.\n\n6\\. If the sacrifice is injured by the Sama-veda side, let him offer a\nlibation in the \xc3\x82havaniya fire, saying, Sva _h_ , Svaha! Thus does he bind\ntogether and heal, by means of the essence and the power of the Saman verses\nthemselves, whatever break the Saman sacrifice may have suffered.\n\np. 71\n\n7\\. As one binds (softens) gold by means of lava _n_ a 1 (borax), and silver\nby means of gold, and tin by means of silver, and lead by means of tin, and\niron (loha) by means of lead, and wood by means of iron, or also by means of\nleather,\n\n8\\. Thus does one bind together and heal any break in the sacrifice by means\nof (the Vyah _ri_ tis or sacrificial interjections which are) the essence and\nstrength of the three worlds, of the deities, and of the threefold knowledge.\nThat sacrifice is healed 2 in which there is a Brahman priest who knows this.\n\n9\\. That sacrifice is inclined towards the north (in the right way) in which\nthere is a Brahman priest who knows this. And with regard to such a Brahman\npriest there is the following Gatha 3: 'Whereever it falls back, thither the\nman 4 goes,'--viz. the Brahman only, as one of the _Ri_ tvi _g_ priests. 'He\nsaves the Kurus as a mare' (viz. a Brahman priest who\n\np. 72\n\nknows this, saves the sacrifice, the sacrificer, and all the other priests).\nTherefore let a man make him who knows this his Brahman priest, not one who\ndoes not know it, who does not know it.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[71:1](sbe01094.htm#fr_223) Lava _n_ a, a kind of salt, explained by kshara\nand _t_ a\xe1\xb9\x85ka or _t_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kana. It is evidently borax, which is still imported\nfrom the East Indies under the name of tincal, and used as a flux in chemical\nprocesses.\n\n[71:2](sbe01094.htm#fr_224) Bheshagak _ri_ ta, explained by bhesha _g_ ena\n'iva k _ri_ ta _h_ sa _m_ sk _ri_ ta _h_ , and also by _k_ ikitsakena su _s_\nikshitena 'esha ya _g_ \xc3\xb1o bhavati,' which looks as if the commentator had\ntaken it as a genitive of bhesha _g_ ak _ri_ t.\n\n[71:3](sbe01094.htm#fr_225) This Gatha (or, according to _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, Anugatha)\nis probably a Gayatri, though \xc3\x82nandagiri says that it is not in the Gayatri or\nany other definite metre. It may have been originally 'yato yata avartate,\ntattad ga _k_ _kh_ ati manava _h_ , kurun a _s_ vabhirakshati.' This might be\ntaken from an old epic ballad, 'Wherever the army fell back, thither the man\nwent; the mare (mares being preferred to stallions in war) saves the Kurus.'\nThat verse was applied to the Brahman priest succouring the sacrifice,\nwhenever it seemed to waver, and protecting the Kurus, i. e. the performers of\nthe sacrifice.\n\n[71:4](sbe01094.htm#fr_226) Manava, explained from mauna, or manana, but\npossibly originally, a descendant of Manu.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 1](sbe01095.htm)\n\n"
