For the first half of the\nwork I could avail myself, in the first place, of the text, together with the\ncommentary of Mat _ri_ datta, which the late Dr. Schoenberg of Vienna had\nprepared for publication, and which was based on a number of MSS collated by\nhim. It is my melancholy duty gratefully to acknowledge here the kindness with\nwhich that prematurely deceased young scholar has placed at my disposal the\nmaterials he had collected, and the results of his labour which he continued\ntill the last days of his life. For the second half of the Sutra his death\ndeprived me of this important assistance; here then Professors Kielhorn of\nGottingen and Buhler of Vienna have been kind enough to enable me to finish\nthe task of this translation, by lending me two MSS. of the text and two MSS.\nof Mat _ri_ datta's commentary which they possess.\n\nFinally, Dr. J. Kirste of Vienna very kindly sent me the proof-sheets of his\nvaluable edition before it was published. With the aid of these my translation\nhas been revised.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 1, 1](sbe30044.htm)\n\n"
