IX.\n\nPlanetary system, under the type of a \xc5\x9ai\xc5\x9bumara or porpoise. The earth\nnourished by the sun. Of rain whilst the sun shines. Of rain from clouds. Rain\nthe support, of vegetation, and thence of animal life. Narayan\xcc\x81a the support\nof all beings.\n\nTHE form of the mighty Hari which is present in heaven, consisting of the\nconstellations, is that of a porpoise, with Dhruva situated in the tail. As\nDhruva revolves, it causes the moon, sun, and stars to turn round also; and\nthe lunar asterisms follow in its circular path; for all the celestial\nluminaries are in fact bound to the polar-star by aerial cords. The porpoise-\nlike figure of the celestial sphere is upheld by Narayan\xcc\x81a, who himself, in\nplanetary radiance, is seated in its heart; whilst the son of Uttanapada,\nDhruva, in consequence of his adoration of the lord of the world, shines in\nthe tail of the stellar porpoise 1. The upholder of the porpoise-shaped sphere\nis the sovereign of all, Janarddana. This sphere is the supporter of Dhruva;\nand by Dhruva the sun is upstayed. Upon the sun depends this world, with its\ngods, demons, and men. In what manner the world depends upon the sun, be\nattentive, and you shall hear.\n\nDuring eight months of the year the sun attracts the waters, which are the\nessence of all fluids, and then pours them upon earths (during the other four\nmonths) as rain 2: from rain grows corn; and by corn the whole world subsists.\nThe sun with his scorching rays absorbs the moisture of the earth, and with\nthem nourishes the moon. The moon communicates, through tubes of air, its dews\nto the clouds, which, being composed of smoke, fire, and wind (or vapour), can\nretain the waters with which they are charged: they are therefore called\nAbhras, because their contents are not dispersed 3. When however they are\nbroken to\n\np. 231\n\npieces by the wind, then watery stores descend, bland, and freed front every\nimpurity by the sweetening process of time. The sun, Maitreya, exhales watery\nfluids from four sources, seas, rivers, the earth, and living creatures. The\nwater that the sun has drawn up from the Ganga of the skies he quickly pours\ndown with his rays, and without a cloud; and men who are touched by this pure\nrain are cleansed from the soil of sin, and never see hell: this is termed\ncelestial ablution. That rain which falls whilst the sun is shining, and\nwithout a cloud in the sky, is the water of the heavenly Ganges, shed by the\nsolar rays. If, however, rain falls from a bright and cloudless sky whilst the\nsun is in the mansion of Krittika and the other asterisms counted by odd\nnumbers, as the third, fifth, &c., the water, although that of the Ganga of\nthe sky, is scattered, by the elephants of the quarters, not by the rays of\nthe sun: it is only when such rain falls, and the sun is in the even\nasterisms, that it is distributed by his beams 4.\n\nThe water which the clouds shed upon earth is in truth the ambrosia of living\nbeings, for it gives fertility to the plants which are the support of their\nexistence. By this all vegetables grow and are matured, and become the means\nof maintaining life. With them, again, those men\n\np. 232\n\nwho take the law for their light perform daily sacrifices, and through them\ngive nourishment to the gods. And thus sacrifices, the Vedas, the font'\ncastes, with the Brahmans at their head, all the residences of the gods, all\nthe tribes of animals, the whole world, all are supported by the rains by\nwhich food is produced. But the rain is evolved by the sun; the sun is\nsustained by Dhruva; and Dhruva is supported by the celestial porpoise-shaped\nsphere, which is one with Narayan\xcc\x81a. Narayan\xcc\x81a, the primeval existent, and\neternally enduring, seated in the heart of the stellar sphere, is the\nsupporter of all beings.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[230:1](vp067.htm#fr_709) A more particular description of this porpoise\noccurs farther on.\n\n[230:2](vp067.htm#fr_710) Consequently, the Linga P. observes, there is no\nwaste of water in the universe, as it is in constant circulation.\n\n[230:3](vp067.htm#fr_711) The theory of the clouds is more fully detailed in\nthe Vayu, Linga, and Matsya p. 231 Puran\xcc\x81as: it is the same in its general\ntenor, but comprises additional circumstances. Clouds, according to those\nauthorities, are of three classes: 1. \xc3\x81gneya, originating from fire or heat,\nor in other words evaporation: they are charged with wind and rain, and are of\nvarious orders, amongst which are those called Jimuta, from their supporting\nlife; 2. Brahmaja, born from the breath of Brahma: these are the clouds whence\nthunder and lightning proceed: and 3. Pakshaja, or clouds which were\noriginally the wings of the mountains, and which were cut off by Indra: these\nare also termed Pushkaravarttakas, from their including water in their\nvortices: they are the largest and most formidable of all, and are those\nwhich, at the end of the Yugas and Kalpas, poor down the waters of the deluge.\nThe shell of the egg of Brahma, or of the universe, is formed of the primitive\nclouds.\n\n[231:4](vp067.htm#fr_712) According to the Vayu, the water scattered by the\nelephants of the quarters is in summer dew, and in winter snow; or the latter\nis brought by the winds from a city called Pun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ra, which lies between the\nHimavat and Hemakuta mountains, and falls down upon the former. In like\nmanner, also, as heat radiates from the sun, so cold radiates from the moon.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter X](vp068.htm)\n\n"
