The (eleven Anuvakas called) Rudras together with (the ten hymns) seen by\nMadhu _k_ _kh_ andas, the Gayatri with the syllable Om, and likewise the seven\nVyah _ri_ tis (are the texts) which should be muttered (and) which remove\nguilt. 1\n\n2\\. The M _ri_ garesh _t_ i, the Pavitresh _t_ i, the Trihavis, the Pavamani\nare the Ish _t_ is which efface sin, if they are (each) combined with the Vai\n_s_ vanara (Dvada _s_ akapala). 2\n\n3-4. Learn, also, the following most excellent secret; he will be freed from\nall sins of all kinds who sprinkles himself with water, reciting the Pavitras,\nwho mutters the eleven (Anuvakas called) Rudras, who offers burnt oblations of\nbutter, reciting the Pavitras, and gives gold, a cow, and sesamum (to Brahma\n_n_ as).\n\n5\\. He who partakes of boiled barley-gruel, mixed with cow's urine, liquid\ncowdung, sour milk, milk, and butter, is quickly freed from sin. 5\n\n6\\. Both he who has begotten a child on a _S_ udra woman and he who has had\nconnexion with a female, 6\n\np. 329\n\nintercourse with whom is forbidden (agamya), are purified (if they live)\naccording to this rule during seven days.\n\n7\\. (That is likewise) the remedy when one has swallowed semen, ordure, and\nurine, or eaten the food of persons whose food must not be eaten, (and also)\nwhen a younger brother has kindled the sacred fire, has offered a _S_ rauta\nsacrifice, or taken a wife before the elder. 7\n\n8\\. He who has committed even a great number of (wicked) actions, excepting\nmortal sins, will be freed (by that rule) from all guilt. That is the\nstatement of the virtuous.\n\n9\\. But (this) ordinance, which is based on the authority of the sacred texts,\nis stated (to be that) through which Bharadva _g_ a and others became equal to\nBrahman,\n\n10\\. Through the performance of these rites a Brahma _n_ a, whose heart is\nfull of peace, obtains whatever desires he may have in his heart.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[328:1](sbe1488.htm#fr_1455) **6**. The hymns are Rig-veda I, 1-10.\n\n[328:2](sbe1488.htm#fr_1456) Regarding the M _ri_ garesh _t_ i, see Taitt. Sa\n_m_ hita IV, 7, 15. In explanation of the term Trihavis, Govinda adds the word\nSavanesh _t_ i.\n\n[328:5](sbe1488.htm#fr_1457) Yavaka, translated, as usually, by barley-gruel,\ncan also denote, as Govinda points out, other dishes made of barley.\n\n[328:6](sbe1488.htm#fr_1458) See above, II, 1, 2, 7, 10, 13-14.\n\n[329:7](sbe1488.htm#fr_1459) See above, II, 2, 1, 21, 39-40. I follow the\nreading of M. and of the commentary, paryadhane _g_ yayor etat parivitte _k_ a\nbhesha _g_ am. The reading of the Dekhan MSS. is etat patite _k_ aiva bho _g_\nanam, 'that food must be eaten  and when one has become an outcast.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na IV, Adhyaya 7](sbe1489.htm)\n\n"
