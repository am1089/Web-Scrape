It became\n\np. 55\n\nexistent, it grew. It turned into an egg 1. The egg lay for the time of a\nyear. The egg broke open. The two halves were one of silver, the other of\ngold.\n\n2\\. The silver one became this earth, the golden one the sky, the thick\nmembrane (of the white) the mountains, the thin membrane (of the yoke) the\nmist with the clouds, the small veins the rivers, the fluid the sea.\n\n3\\. And what was born from it that was \xc3\x82ditya, the sun. When he was born\nshouts of hurrah arose, and all beings arose, and all things which they\ndesired. Therefore whenever the sun rises and sets, shouts of hurrah arise,\nand all beings arise, and all things which they desire.\n\n4\\. If any one knowing this meditates on the sun as Brahman, pleasant shouts\nwill approach him and will continue, yea, they will continue.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[54:1](sbe01077.htm#fr_192) \xc3\x82ditya, or the sun, had before been represented as\none of the four feet of Brahman. He is now represented as Brahman, or as to be\nmeditated on as such.\n\n[54:2](sbe01077.htm#fr_193) Not yet existing, not yet developed in form and\nname, and therefore as if not existing.\n\n[55:1](sbe01077.htm#fr_194) \xc3\x82 _n_ _d_ a instead of a _n_ _d_ a is explained as\na Vedic irregularity. A similar cosmogony is given in Manu's Law Book, I, 12\nseq. See Kellgren, Mythus de ovo mundano, Helsingfors, 1849.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 1](sbe01078.htm)\n\n"
