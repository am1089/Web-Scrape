1  \nAll fairest graces join to deck  \nHis head, his brow, his stately neck,  \nAnd limbs in fair proportion set:  \nThe manliest form e'er fashioned yet.  \nGraced with each high imperial mark,  \nHis skin is soft and lustrous dark.  \nLarge are his eyes that sweetly shine  \nWith majesty almost divine.  \nHis plighted word he ne'er forgets;  \nOn erring sense a watch he sets.  \nBy nature wise, his teacher's skill  \nHas trained him to subdue his will.  \nGood, resolute and pure, and strong,  \nHe guards mankind from scathe and wrong,  \nAnd lends his aid, and ne'er in vain,  \nThe cause of justice to maintain.  \nWell has he studied o'er and o'er  \nThe Vedas 2 and their kindred lore.  \n\nWell skilled is he the bow to draw, 1b  \nWell trained in arts and versed in law;  \nHigh-souled and meet for happy fate,  \nMost tender and compassionate;  \nThe noblest of all lordly givers,  \nWhom good men follow, as the rivers  \nFollow the King of Floods, the sea:  \nSo liberal, so just is he.  \nThe joy of Queen Kaus'alya's 2b heart,  \nIn every virtue he has part:  \nFirm as Himalaya's 3b snowy steep,  \nUnfathomed like the mighty deep:  \nThe peer of Vishnu's power and might,  \nAnd lovely as the Lord of Night; 4b  \nPatient as Earth, but, roused to ire,  \nFierce as the world-destroying fire;  \nIn bounty like the Lord of Gold, 5b  \nAnd Justice self ia human mould.  \n\nWith him, his best and eldest son,  \nBy all his princely virtues won  \nKing Das'aratha 6b willed to share  \nHis kingdom as the Regent Heir.  \nBut when Kaikeyi, youngest queen,  \nWith eyes of envious hate had seen  \nThe solemn pomp and regal state  \nPrepared the prince to consecrate,  \nShe bade the hapless king bestow  \nTwo gifts he promised long ago,  \nThat Rama to the woods should flee,  \nAnd that her child the heir should be.  \n\nBy chains of duty firmly tied,  \nThw wretched king perforce complied.  \n\np. 4  \n\nRama, to please Kaikeyi went  \nObedient forth to banishment.  \nThen Lakshman's truth was nobly shown,  \nThen were his love and courage known,  \nWhen for his brother's sake he dared  \nAll perils, and his exile shared.  \nAnd Sita, Rama's darling wife,  \nLoved even as he loved his life,  \nWhom happy marks combined to bless,  \nA miracle of loveliness,  \nOf Janak's royal lineage sprung,  \nMost excellent of women, clung  \nTo her dear lord, like Rohini  \nRejoicing with the Moon to be.  1  \nThe King and people, sad of mood,  \nThe hero's car awhile pursued.  \nBut when Prince Rama lighted down  \nAt S'riugavera's pleasant town,  \nWhere Ganga's holy waters flow,  \nHe bade his driver turn and go.  \nGuha, Nishadas' king, he met,  \nAnd on the farther bank was set.  \nThen on from wood to wood they strayed,  \nO'er many a stream, through constant shade,  \nAs Bharadvaja bade them, till  \nThey came to Chitrakuta's hill.  \nAnd Rama there, with Lakshman's aid,  \nA pleasant little cottage made,  \nAnd spent his days with Sita, dressed  \n\nIn coat of bark and deerskin vest.  1b  \nAnd Chitrakuta grew to be  \nAs bright with those illustrious three  \nAn Meru's  2b sacred peaks that shine  \nWith glory, when the Gods recline  \nBeneath them: Siva's  3b self between  \nThe Lord of Gold and Beauty's Queen.  \n\nThe aged king for Rama pined,  \nAnd for the skies the earth resigned,  \nBharat, his son, refused to reign,  \nThough urged by all the twice-born  4b train.  \nForth to the woods he fared to meet  \nHia brother, fell before his feet,  \nAnd cried, 'Thy [claim](errata.htm#0) all men allow:  \nO come, our lord and king be thou.'  \nBut Rama nobly chose to be  \nObservant of his sire's decree.  \nHe placed his sandals  5b in his hand  \nA pledge that he would rule the land:  \nAnd bade his brother turn again.  \nThen Bharat. finding prayer was vain,  \nThe sandals took and went away;  \nNor in Ayodhya would he stay.  \nBut turned to Nandigrama, where  \nHe ruled the realm with watchful care,  \nStill longing eagerly to learn  \nTidings of Rama's safe return.  \n\nThen lest the people should repeat  \nTheir visit to his calm retreat,  \nAway from Chitrakuta's hill  \nFared Rama ever onward till  \n\np. 5  \n\nBeneath the shady trees he stood  \nOf Dandaka's primeval wood,  \nViradha, giant fiend, he slew,  \nAnd then Agastya's friendship knew.  \nCounselled by him he gained the sword  \nAnd bow of Indra, heavenly lord:  \nA pair of quivers too, that bore  \nOf arrows an exhaustless store.  \nWhile there he dwelt in greenwood shade  \nThe trembling hermits sought his aid,  \nAnd bade him with his sword and bow  \nDestroy the fiends who worked them woe:  \nTo come like Indra strong and brave,  \nA guardian God to help and save.  \nAnd Rama's falchion left its trace  \nDeep cut on Surpanakha's face:  \nA hideous giantess who came  \nBurning for him with lawless flame.  \nTheir sister's cries the giants heard.  \nAnd vengeance in each bosom stirred:  \nThe monster of the triple head.  \nAnd Dushan to the contest sped.  \nBut they and myriad fiends beside  \nBeneath the might of Rama died.  \n\nWhen Ravan, dreaded warrior, knew  \nThe slaughter of his giant crew:  \nRavan, the king, whose name of fear  \nEarth, hell, and heaven all shook to hear:  \nHe bade the fiend Maricha aid  \nThe vengeful plot his fury laid.  \nIn vain the wise Maricha tried  \nTo turn him from his course aside:  \nNot Ravan's self, he said, might hope  \nWith Rama and his strength to cope.  \nImpelled by fate and blind with rage  \nHe came to Rama's hermitage.  \nThere, by Maricha's magic art,  \nHe wiled the princely youths apart,  \nThe vulture 1 slew, and bore away  \nThe wife of Rama as his prey.  \nThe son of Raghu 2 came and found  \nJatayu slain upon the ground.  \nHe rushed within his leafy cot;  \nHe sought his wife, but found her not.  \nThen, then the hero's senses failed;  \nIn mad despair he wept and wailed,  \nUpon the pile that bird he laid,  \nAnd still in quest of Sita strayed.  \nA hideous giant then he saw,  \nKabandha named, a shape of awe.  \n\nThe monstrous fiend he smote and slew,  \nAnd in the flame the body threw;  \nWhen straight from out the funeral flame  \nIn lovely form Kabandha came,  \nAnd bade him seek in his distress  \nA wise and holy hermitess.  \nBy counsel of this saintly dame  \nTo Pampa's pleasant flood he came,  \nAnd there the steadfast friendship won  \nOf Hanuman the Wind-God's son.  \nCounselled by him he told his grief  \nTo great Sugriva, Vanar chief,  \nWho, knowing all the tale, before  \nThe sacred flame alliance swore.  \nSugriva to his new-found friend  \nTold his own story to the end:  \nHis hate of Bali for the wrong  \nAnd insult he had borne so long.  \nAnd Rama lent a willing ear  \nAnd promised to allay his fear.  \nSugriva warned him of the might  \nOf Bali, matchless in the fight,  \nAnd, credence for his tale to gain,  \nShowed the huge fiend 1b by Bali slain.  \nThe prostrate corpse of mountain size  \nSeemed nothing in the hero's eyes;  \nHe lightly kicked it, as it lay,  \nAnd cast it twenty leagues 2b away.  \nTo prove his might his arrows through  \nSeven palms in line, uninjured, flew.  \nHe cleft a mighty hill apart,  \nAnd down to hell he hurled his dart,  \nThen high Sugriva's spirit rose,  \nAssured of conquest o'er his foes.  \nWith his new champion by his side  \nTo vast Kishkindha's cave he hied.  \nThen, summoned by his awful shout,  \nKing Bali came in fury out,  \nFirst comforted his trembling wife,  \nThen sought Sugriva in the strife.  \nOne shaft from Rama's deadly bow  \nThe monarch in the dust laid low.  \nThen Rama bade Sugriva reign  \nIn place of royal Bali slain.  \nThen speedy envoys hurried forth  \nEastward and westward, south and north,  \nCommanded by the grateful king  \nTidings of Rama's spouse to bring.  \n\nThen by Sampati's counsel led,  \nBrave Hanuman, who mocked at dread,  \nSprang at one wild tremendous leap  \nTwo hundred leagues across the deep.  \nTo Lanka's 3b town he urged his way,  \nWhere Ravan held his royal sway.  \n\np. 6  \n\nThere pensive 'neath As'oka  1 boughs  \nHe found poor Sita, Rama's spouse.  \nHe gave the hapless girl a ring,  \nA token from her lord and king.  \nA pledge from her fair hand he bore;  \nThen battered down the garden door.  \nFive captains of the host be slew,  \nSeven sons of councillors o'erthrew;  \nCrushed youthful Aksha on the field,  \nThen to his captors chose to yield.  \nSoon from their bonds his limbs were free,  \nBut honouring the high decree  \nWhich Brahma had pronounced of yore,  2  \nHe calmly all their insults bore.  \nThe town he burnt with hostile flame,  \nAnd spoke again with Rama's dame,  \nThen swiftly back to Rama flew  \nWith tidings of the interview.  \n   Then with Sugriva for his guide,  \nCame Rama to the ocean side.  \nHe smote the sea with shafts as bright  \nAs sunbeams in their summer height,  \nAnd quick appeared the Rivers' King  3  \nObedient to the summoning.  \nA bridge was thrown by Nala o'er  \nThe narrow sea from shore to shore.  4  \nThey crossed to Lanka's golden town,  \nWhere Rama's hand smote Ravan down.  \nVibhishan there was left to reign  \nOver his brother's wide domain.  \nTo meet her husband Sita came;  \nBut Rama, stung with ire and shame,  \nWith bitter words his wife addressed  \nBefore the crowd that round her pressed.  \nBut Sita, touched with noble ire,  \nGave her fair body to the fire.  \nThen straight the God of Wind appeared,  \nAnd words from heaven her honour cleared.  \nAnd Rama clasped his wife again,  \nUninjured, pure from spot and stain,  \nObedient to the Lord of Fire  \nAnd the high mandate of his sire.  \nLed by the Lord who rules the sky,  \nThe Gods and heavenly saints drew nigh,  \nAnd honoured him with worthy meed,  \nRejoicing in each glorious deed.  \nHis task achieved, his foe removed,  \n\nHe triumphed, by the Gods approved,  \nBy grace of Heaven he raised to life  \nThe chieftains slain in mortal strife;  \nThen in the magic chariot through  \nThe clouds to Nandigrama flew.  \nMet by his faithful brothers there,  \nHe loosed his votive coil of hair:  \nThence fair Ayodhya's town he gained,  \nAnd o'er his father's kingdom reigned.  \nDisease or famine ne'er oppressed  \nHis happy people, richly blest  \nWith all the joys of ample wealth,  \nOf sweet content and perfect health.  \nNo widow mourned her well-loved mate,  \nNo sire his son's untimely fate.  \nThey feared not storm or robber's hand;  \nNo fire or flood laid waste the land:  \nThe Golden Age  1b had come again  \nTo bless the days of Rama's reign.  \n   From him, the great and glorious king,  \nShall many a princely scion spring.  \nAnd he shall rule, beloved by men,  \nTen thousand years and hundreds ten, 2b  \nAnd when his life on earth is past  \nTo Brahma's world shall go at last.'  \n   Whoe'er this noble poem reads  \nThat tells the tale of Rama's deeds,  \nGood as the Scriptures, he shall be  \nFrom every sin and blemish free.  \nWhoever reads the saving strain,  \nWith all his kin the heavens shall gain.  \nBrahmans who read shall gather hence  \nThe highest praise for eloquence.  \nThe warrior, o'er the laud shall reign,  \nThe merchant, luck in trade obtain;  \nAnd S'udras listening  3b ne'er shall fail  \nTo reap advantage from the tale.  4b  \n\np. 7  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1:1b](ry001.htm#fr_3) Comparison with the Ganges is implied, that river being\ncalled the purifier of the world.\n\n[1:2b](ry001.htm#fr_4) 'This name may have been given to the father of Valmiki\nallegorically.

In the\npalmistry of Europe the line of fortune, as well as the line of life, is in\nthe hand. Cardan says that marks on the nails and teeth also show what is to\nhappen to us: 'Sunt etiam in nobis vestigia quaedam futurorum eyentuum in\nunguibus atque etiam in dentibus.'
