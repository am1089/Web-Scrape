Haris\xc2\x92chandra said :-- \xc2\x93O Muni! I will not take my food until I pay you\nyour Dak _s_ i _n_ a in gold; know this to be my resolve; therefore O One of\ngood vows! Discard all your anxieties for Dak _s_ i _n_ a. I am the King of\nthe Solar dynasty; especially since the time I have completed my Rajasuya\nSacrifice, I give to everyman whatever he desires. So, O Lord! How can it be\npossible that I will not give what I have voluntarily promised myself? O Best\nof Dvijas! I will certainly pay off your debt. I must give you the gold as you\ndesire; be calm and patient; but you will have to wait one month; and on\ngetting the money I will pay it off to you.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n5-8. Vis\xc2\x92vamitra said :-- \xc2\x93O King! Kingdom, treasury and strength are the\nthree sources of income; but you are now deprived of all these. Whence, now,\ndo you expect to get gold? O King! Vain are your hopes to get money; what am I\nto do now? You are now wealthless and how can I, out of greed, give you\ntrouble? O King! Better say \xc2\x91I will not be able to give you Dak _s_ i _n_ a,\xc2\x92\nand I will then quit my strong expectation and go away as I like. And you,\ntoo, can think that you have no gold, so how can you give money and so you can\ngo wherever you like with your wife and son.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n9-20. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing these words of the Muni, at his time of\ndeparture, the King said :-- \xc2\x93O Brahma _n_ a! Be patient and I will certainly\ngive you your Dak _s_ i _n_ a. O Dvija! My wife, son and I myself are all\nhealthy; so selling these, I will give you the money; there is no doubt in\nthis. O Lord! Kindly enquire whether there is anyone who can purchase us and I\nwill agree to become the slave with my wife and son. O Muni! You can sell all\nof us and the price you get, you can take two and a half loads of gold out of\nthat and be pleased.\xc2\x94 Thus saying, the King went to Benares where S\xc2\x92a _n_ kara\nwas staying with his dear consort Uma. The King saw the beautiful city, the\nsight of which makes one\xc2\x92s heart dance with more joy and he said that he had\nbecome blessed. Then he went to the banks of the Bhagirathi and bathed\n\n\n\np. 662\n\n\n\nin the Ganges and offered peace-offerings (Tarpa _n_ ) to the Devas and the\nPitris and completing the worship of his I _s_ ta Deva (his own Deity) looked\naround where he would go. The King entering into the beautiful city of Benares\nbegan to think that no human being is protecting this city but S\xc2\x92iva Himself\nis protecting it. So if he lives there, he would not be living in a city which\nhas been given away by him to Vis\xc2\x92vamitra. The King, then, distressed much\nwith pain and trouble and being very much bewildered, began to journey on foot\nwith his wife and son and entered into the city and placed his confidence. At\nthis moment he saw the Muni Vis\xc2\x92vamitra, wanting Dak _s_ i _n_ a and humbly\nbowed down and spoke with folded palms :-- \xc2\x93O Muni! My dear wife, my son and I\nmyself are living here; you can take any of us and have your work done; or say\nwhat other work we will have to do for you.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n21\\. Vis\xc2\x92vamitra said :-- \xc2\x93You promised that you would pay Dak _s_ i _n_ a at\nthe end of one month; and today that one month is completed; if you remember,\nthen give me the Dak _s_ i _n_ a.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n22\\. The King said :-- \xc2\x93O Brahma _n_ a! You are wise and are endowed with the\npower of tapas (asceticism); as yet one month is not complete; still half a\nday is remaining; wait till then; and no longer.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n23-27. Vis\xc2\x92vamitra said :-- \xc2\x93O King! Let it be. I will come again and if you\ndo not give me then, I will curse you. Thus saying Vis\xc2\x92vamitra went away. The\nKing then thought within himself how be would pay him back what he had\npromised. There is no influential friend of mine in this Benares city who can\nhelp me with money; where then can I get the requisite money. I am a K _s_\nattriya. Pratigraha (begging or accepting any gift) is forbidden to me and how\ncan I beg or accept any gift! According to the code of Dharma, the offering of\nsacrifices (on one\xc2\x92s own behalf), studying, and giving are the three duties\nordained to a King. And if I die not paying a Brahmi _n_ \xc2\x92s Dak _s_ i _n_ a, I\nwill be polluted with the sin of stealing a Brahmi _n_ \xc2\x92s property and I will\nthen be born a worm or will became a Preta. So to sell myself (and pay off the\ndebts) is better than this.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n28-33. Suta said :-- O Ri _s_ is! When the King was thus thinking humbly with\nhis face bent downwards, and in a distracted state of mind, his wife spoke to\nhim with tears in her eyes and in a voice, choked with feelings :-- \xc2\x93O King!\nDiscard all cares and keep your own Dharma, Truth. He who is divorced from\nTruth is forsaken like a Preta. O Best of all men! To keep one\xc2\x92s Truth is\none\xc2\x92s Dharma; there is no other Dharma superior to it; so the sages declare.\nHe whose\n\n\n\np. 663\n\n\n\nwords turn out false, his Agnihotra, study, and gifts and all action, become\nfruitless. Truth is very much praised in the Dharma S\xc2\x92astra and this Truth\nraises up and saves the virtuous souls. Similarly falsehood, no doubt, drags a\nvicious man to hell. The King Yayati performed the Horse sacrifice, and the\nRajasuya sacrifice and went to Heavens but once he spoke falsely and so he was\ndislodged from the Heavens.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n34\\. The King said :-- \xc2\x93O Thou, going like an elephant! I have my son who will\nmultiply my line; speak out what Thou wishest to say.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n35\\. The Queen said :-- \xc2\x93O King! The wives are meant for sons (your having me\nhas been fulfilled as there is your son). So sell me for the money value and\ngive the Dak _s_ i _n_ a to the Brahmi _n_. Let you not deviate from the\nTruth.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n36-45. Vyasa spoke :-- Hearing this, the King fainted. Afterward regaining\nconsciousness, he wept with a grievous heart. O gentle One! What you have\nuttered just now has caused me much pain; am I such a Sinner as to forget\nentirely all your conversations and your sweet smiles! Alas! O Sweet-smiling\nOne! You ought not to speak such words. O Fair One! How have you been able to\nutter these harsh words not fit to be spoken! Speaking thus, the King became\nimpatient at the idea of selling his wife and fainted and fell to the ground.\nSeeing him fainted and lying flat on the ground, the Queen became grievously\nhurt and spoke with great compassion. O King! Whose evil have you done that\nyou have fallen into this calamity? Alas! He who is accustomed to sleep in a\nroom adorned with carpets is today like a humble man, sleeping on the ground!\nThe King who gave crores and crores of golden mohurs to the Brahmi _n_ s, that\nsame King, my husband is lying now on the ground! Alas! What a painful thing!\nO Fate! What has this King done to you that You have thrown this Indra and\nUpendra like King in this dire calamity! Thus saying, the beautiful queen (of\ngood hips) very much grieved by the sight of her husband\xc2\x92s pain fell down\nunconscious on the ground. Then the boy prince, seeing father and mother both\nsenseless, lying on the ground, became very much troubled, and, becoming\nhungry, cried, \xc2\x93O Father! O Father! I am very hungry; give me food to eat; O\nMother! O Mother! My tongue is being parched; give me food to eat,\xc2\x94 and the\nboy began to weep repeatedly.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twentieth Chapter of the Seventh Book on the earnestness of\nHaris\xc2\x92chandra to pay off the Dak _s_ i _n_ a in the Mahapura _n_ am S'ri Mad\nDevi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 21](bk07ch21.htm)\n\n"
