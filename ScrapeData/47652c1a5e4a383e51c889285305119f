So-and-So's  \nfather is this man. Sire of this man is So-and-So.  \nMay we\xc2\x97All-hail!\xc2\x97be lords of rich possessions.  \nWhat active highest name thou hast, O Rudra, therein thou  \nart an offering, art an offering at home. All-hail!  \n21 Indra's bolt art thou. I by the direction of Mitra-Varuna,  \nDirectors, yoke thee.  \nI, the uninjured Arjuna, mount thee for firmness, thee for food.  \nBy quickening of the Maruts be thou victor. May we obtain  \nby mind: with power united.  \n22 Let us not, Indra, conqueror of the mighty, unfit through  \nlack of prayer fail to obtain thee.  \nAscend the car which thou whose hand bears thunder  \ncontrollest, and the reins with noble horses.\n\np. 84\n\n23 All hail to Agni, Master of the Household!

Be therewith my vassal.  \n29 May spacious Agni, Lord of Duty, gladly, vast Agni, Duty's  \nLord, accept the butter. All-hail!  \nHallowed by Svaha, with the beams of Surya, strive for his  \ncentral place among the kinsmen.  \n30 I creep forth urged onward by Savitar the Impeller; by  \nSarasvati, Speech; by Tvashtar, created forms; by Pushan,  \ncattle; by this Indra; by Brihaspati, Devotion; by  \nVaruna, Power; by Agni, Brilliance; by Soma, the King;  \nby Vishnu the tenth Deity.  \n31 Get dressed for the Asvins. Get dressed for Sarasvati:  \nGet dressed for Indra the Good Deliverer:  \nSoma the Wind, purified by the strainer, Indra's meet  \nfriend, hath gone o\xc2\x92erflowing backward.  \n32 What then? As men whose fields are full of barley reap  \nthe ripe corn, removing it in order,  \nSo bring the food of these men, bring it hither, who pay  \nthe Sacred Grass their spoken homage.  \nTaken upon a base art thou. Thee for the Asvins.  \nThee for Sarasvati, and thee for Indra, for the Excellent  \nProtector.\n\np. 86\n\n33 Ye Asvins, Lords of Splendour, drank full draughts of  \ngrateful Soma juice,  \nAnd aided Indra in his deeds with Namuchi of Asura birth.  \n34 As parents aid a son, both Asvins aided thee, Indra, with  \ntheir wondrous powers and wisdom.  \nWhen thou with might hadst drunk the draught that  \ngladdens, Sarasvati, O Bounteous Lord, refreshed thee.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book XI](wyvbk11.htm)\n\n"
