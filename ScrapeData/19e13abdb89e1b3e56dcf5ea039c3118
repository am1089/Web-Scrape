Charm with lead, against demons and sorcerers.\n\n1\\. Against the devouring demons who, in the night of the full-moon, have\narisen in throngs, may Agni, the strong, the slayer of the sorcerers, give us\ncourage!  \n2\\. To the lead Varuna gives blessing, to the lead Agni gives help. Indra gave\nme the lead: unfailingly it dispels sorcery.  \n3\\. This (lead) overcomes the vishkandha, this smites the devouring demons\n(atrin); with this I have overwhelmed all the brood of the Pisakas.  \n4\\. If thou slayest our cow, if our horse or our domestic, we pierce thee with\nthe lead, so that thou shalt not slay our heroes.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 2.
