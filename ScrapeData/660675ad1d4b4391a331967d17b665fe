SACRIFICE (continued)\n\n## PRAPATHAKA I\n\n_\n\nThe One Day Sacrifices\n\n_\n\n### vii. 1. 1.\n\nProduction of offspring is light. Agni is the light of the gods; the Viraj is\nthe light of the metres. The Viraj of speech ends in Agni; it is produced\naccording to the Viraj. Therefore it is called light. Two Stomas bear the\nmorning pressing, like expiration and inspiration; two the midday pressing,\nlike eye and ear; two the third pressing, like speech and support. This\nsacrifice is commensurate with man, and is perfect [1]. Whatever desire a man\nhas, he wins by it, for one wins all by that which is perfect. By means of the\nAgnistoma Prajapati created off spring; by means of the Agnistoma he grasped\nthem. When he grasped them the mule escaped. Following it he took its seed,\nand placed it in the ass. Therefore the ass has double seed. They also say,\n'He placed it in the mare.' Therefore the mare has double seed. They also say,\n'In the plants [2] he placed it.' Therefore plants, though not anointed,\nglisten.' They also say, 'He placed it in offspring.' Therefore twins are\nborn. Therefore the mule has no offspring, for his seed has been taken from\nhim. Therefore he is not suitable for the sacrifice, but is suitable if there\nis a sacrifice when one gives (to the priests) all one's goods or a thousand,\nfor he escaped. He who knowing thus sacrifices with the Agnistoma begets\nunborn offspring and grasps those that are born. Therefore they say, 'It is\nthe best of sacrifices [3].' Prajapati indeed is the best, for he sacrificed\nwith it first. Prajapati desired, 'May I have offspring.' He meted out the\nTrivrt from his mouth. After it the god Agni was created, the Gayatri metre,\nthe Rathantara Saman, of men the Brahman, of cattle the goat; therefore are\nthey the chief, for they were produced from the mouth. From the breast and\narms he meted out the Pa\xc3\xb1cada\xc3\xa7a Stoma. After it the god Indra was created, the\nTristubh metre, the Brhat [4] Saman, of men the Rajanya, of cattle the sheep.\nThere fore they are strong, for they were created from strength. From the\nmiddle he meted out the Saptada\xc3\xa7a Stoma. After it the All-gods as deities were\ncreated, the Jagati metre, the Vairupa Saman, of men the Vai\xc3\xa7ya, of cattle\ncows. Therefore are they to be eaten, for they were created from the\nreceptacle of food. Therefore are they more numerous than others, for they\nwere created after the most numerous of the gods. From his feet he meted out\nthe Ekavin\xc3\xa7a Stoma. After it the Anustubh metre [5] was created, the Vairaja\nSaman, of men the \xc3\x87udra, of cattle the horse. Therefore the two, the horse and\nthe \xc3\x87udra, are dependent on others. Therefore the \xc3\x87udra is not fit for the\nsacrifice, for he was not created after any gods. Therefore they depend on\ntheir feet, for they were created from the feet. The Trivrt is the breaths;\nthe Pa\xc3\xb1cada\xc3\xa7a the half-months; the Saptada\xc3\xa7a Prajapati; these worlds are\nthree; the Ekavin\xc3\xa7a is the sun yonder. In this they rest, in this they find\nsupport. He who knows thus rests on this, finds, support in this.\n\n### vii. 1. 2.\n\nAt the morning pressing he keeps glorifying the Trivrt Stoma by the Gayatri\nmetre; the Pa\xc3\xb1cada\xc3\xa7a Stoma by the Trivrt, which is splendour; the Saptada\xc3\xa7a by\nthe Pa\xc3\xb1cada\xc3\xa7a which is force and strength; the Ekavin\xc3\xa7a by the Saptada\xc3\xa7a which\nis connected with Prajapati and causes begetting. Verily thus Stoma glorifies\nStoma; verily also Stoma leads Stoma forth. As many as are the Stomas, so many\nare desires, so many the worlds, so many the lights; verily so many Stomas, so\nmany desires, so many worlds, so many lights does he win.\n\n### vii. 1. 3.\n\nThe theologians say, 'He indeed would really sacrifice, who having sacrificed\nwith the Agnistoma should also sacrifice with the Sarvastoma.' If they omit\nthe Trivrt Stoma, then his vital airs are omitted, but he who offers the\nsacrifice does so with the wish, 'May it be in my vital airs. If they omit the\nPa\xc3\xb1cada\xc3\xa7a Stoma, his strength is omitted, but he who offers the sacrifice does\nso with the wish, 'May it be in my strength.' If they omit the Saptada\xc3\xa7a Stoma\n[1], his offspring is omitted, but he who offers the sacrifice does so with\nthe wish, 'May it be in my offspring.' If they omit the Ekavin\xc3\xa7a Stoma, his\nsupport is omitted, but he who offers the sacrifice does so with the wish,\n'May it be in my support.' If they omit the Trinava Stoma, his seasons and the\nstrength of the Naksatras are omitted, but he who offers the sacrifice does so\nwith the wish, 'May it be in my seasons and the strength of the Naksatras'\n[2]. If they omit the Trayastrin\xc3\xa7a Stoma, his deities are omitted, and he who\noffers the sacrifice does so with the wish, 'May it be in my deities.' He who\nknows the lowest of the Stomas attaining the first place, obtains him self the\nfirst place. The Trivrt is the lowest of Stomas, the Trivrt occupies the first\nplace. He who know thus obtains the first place.\n\nTHE EXPOSITION OF THE SATTRAS\n\n_\n\nThe Ahina Sacrifices\n\n_\n\n### vii. 1. 4.\n\nThe Angirases performed a sacrificial session. They went to the world of\nheaven. Of them Havismant and Haviskrt were left behind. They desired, 'May we\ntwo go to the world of heaven.' They two saw this two-night rite, they grasped\nit, and sacrificed with it. Then they went to the world of heaven. He, who\nknowing thus offers the two-night sacrifice, goes to the world of heaven. They\nwent with the first day and arrived with the second [1]. The first day is the\nAbhiplava, the second the complete ( _gati_ ). The first day is the Jyotistoma\nform of the Agnistoma; with it he wins splendour. The second day is an\nAtiratra with all the Stomas, that he may obtain all and win all. On the first\nday the Saman is in the Gayatri (metre). The Gayatri is brilliance and\nsplendour; verily he bestows brilliance and splendour on himself. On the\nsecond day (the Saman) is in the Tristubh metre. The Tristubh is force and\nstrength; verily he bestows force and strength on himself. The Saman on the\nfirst day [2] is the Rathantara. The Rathantara is this (earth); verily he\nstands firm on this (earth). (The Saman) on the second is the Brhat. The Brhat\nis yonder (sky); verily he stands firm on yonder (sky). They say, 'Where are\nthe Jagati and the Anustubh?' On the first day the Saman is that of Vikhanas;\nverily he does not leave the Jagati. On the second it is the Soda\xc3\xa7in; verily\nhe does not leave the Anustubh. Then they say, 'If the days fall in the same\nhalf month, then the strength of one day only will belong to the rite.' The\nfirst day takes place on the night of new moon; the second on the next day,\nverily the days fall on separate half-months, and have the several strengths.\nThe first day has Havismant, the second Haviskrt in the finale, for support.\n\n### vii. 1. 5.\n\nThis was in the beginning the waters, the ocean. In it Prajapati becoming the\nwind moved. He saw her, and becoming a boar he seized her. Her, becoming\nVi\xc3\xa7vakarma, he wiped. She extended, she became the earth, and hence the earth\nis called the earth (lit. 'the extended'). In her Prajapati made effort. He\nproduced the gods, Vasus, Rudras, and Adityas. The gods said to Prajapati,\n'Let us have offspring.' He said [1], 'As I have created you by penance, so\nseek ye offspring in penance.' He gave to them Agni as a support, saying,\n'Strive with that support.' They strove with Agni as a support. After a year\nthey produced one cow. They gave it to the Vasus, Rudras, and Adityas, saying\n'Guard it.' The Vasus, Rudras, and Adityas guarded it. It produced for the\nVasus, Rudras, and Adityas (each) three hundred and thirty-three [2]. Thus she\nbecame the thousandth. The gods said to Prajapati, 'Cause sacrifice to be made\nto us with a thousand.' He caused sacrifice to be made by the Vasus with the\nAgnistoma. They won this world and gave (the thousandth). He caused sacrifice\nto be made by the Rudras with the Ukthya. They won the atmosphere and gave\n(the thousand). He caused sacrifice to be made by the Adityas with the\nAtiratra. They won yonder world, and gave (the thousand). Now the atmosphere\n[3] was broken. Therefore the Rudras are murderous, for they have no support.\nTherefore they say, 'The midmost day of the three-day night is not fixed; for\nit was moved.' The Ajya (\xc3\x87astra) of the midmost day is in the Tristubh metre.\nHe recites the Samyana hymns, then recites the Soda\xc3\xa7in, that the day may be\nmade firm and be not loose. Therefore in the three-night rite, the first day\nshould be an Agnistoma, then an Ukthya, then an Atiratra, for the separation\nof these worlds. On each day in succession he gives three hundred continuously\n[4], for the continuance of these worlds. He should not break the decades lest\nhe should thus destroy the Viraj. Now for the thousandth Indra and Visnu\nstrove. Indra reflects, 'By this Visnu will appropriate all the thousand.'\nThey made arrangement as to it, Indra got two-thirds, Visnu the remaining\nthird; verily the fact is recorded in the verse, 'Ye twain have conquered.' It\nis the Achavaka [5] who recites this verse. Now (some say), 'The thousandth is\nto be given to the Hotr'; what is left over, is left over for the Hotr; the\nHotr is the receiver of what has not been taken. Then others say, 'It is to be\ngiven to the Unnetr.' This is left over of the thousand, and the Unnetr is the\none of the priests who is left over. Then some say, 'It is to be given to all\nthose who have a place in the Sadas.' Then some say, 'It should be driven away\nand allowed to wander at will.' Then some say, 'It is to be given to the\nBrahman and the Agnidh [6], two shares to the Brahman and the third to the\nAgnidh. For the Brahman is connected with Indra, the Agnidh with Visnu;\n(verily the division is) just as they two agreed upon. Then some say, 'The one\nwhich is beautiful and of varied colour is the one to be given.' Then others\nsay, 'The one which has two colours and on either side is spotted is the one\nto be given', for the gaining of a thousand. That indeed is the march of the\nthousand ( _sah asrasyayana_). There are a thousand Stotriyas, a thousand\ngifts (to the priests); the world of heaven is measured by a thousand; (verily\nit serves) for the winning of the heavenly world.\n\n### vii. 1. 6.\n\nSoma found a thousand; Indra discovered it after him. Yama approached them and\nsaid to them, 'May I have a share too in it.' They said to him, 'Be it so.'\nYama saw in one of the (cows) strength. He said to them, 'This one has the\nstrength of the thousand, this be mine, the rest yours.' They said, 'We all\nsee that in this one is strength [1]. Let us each have a portion.' So they\ntook shares in the one. They put her into the waters, saying, 'Come out for\nSoma.' She came out in the shape of a red brown cow of one year old, together\nwith three hundred and thirty three. Therefore let one buy the Soma with a red\nbrown cow one year old. He, who knowing thus buys the Soma with a red brown\ncow one year old, buys the Soma with three hundred and thirty-three [2] and\nsacrifices with Soma for which he has paid a good price. They put her into the\nwaters, saying, 'Come out for Indra.' She came out in the shape of a red\ndraught animal with good characteristics, destroying foes, together with three\nhundred and thirty-three. Therefore one should give a red draught animal with\ngood characteristics, destroying foes. He who knowing thus gives a red draught\nanimal with good characteristics, destroying foes, gives her as three hundred\nand thirty-three [3]. They put her into the waters' saying, 'Come out for\nYama.' She came out in the shape of an aged, stupid, utterly bad animal,\ntogether with three hundred and thirty-three. Therefore one should offer as\nthe funeral cow one that is aged, stupid, utterly bad. If a man knowing thus\noffers a cow that is aged, stupid, utterly bad, as the funeral cow, she\nbecomes for him in yonder world three hundred and thirty-three. Speech is the\nthousandth. Therefore [4] a boon must be given; for she is a boon, and when\nshe is given she is a thousand. Therefore one must not accept a boon; for she\nis a boon; verily he would be accepting a thousand. Let him say, 'She is a\nboon', and of another, 'Let this be mine'; verily he avoids accepting a\nthousand. She should be spotted on either side. They say, 'Let her be spotted\non one side only; spotted is the thousand on the other side.' The one for a\nboon [5] should be beautiful, perfect in form; for she is a boon; (verily it\nserves for) prosperity. Leading her round to the north of the Agnidh's place\nhe makes her smell the wooden tub near the Ahavaniya fire, saying,\n\n'Smell the tub, O great one, with broad stream rich in milk;  \nLet the drops enter thee as the streams the ocean;  \nGive me a share in a thousand, with offspring, with cattle;  \nLet wealth again visit me.'\n\nVerily he unites him with offspring, with cattle, with wealth [6]. He becomes\nrich in offspring, in cattle, in wealth, who knows thus. Having gone round the\nAgnidh's place with her, he should offer in front, while the cow stands facing\n(him), Saying,\n\nYe twain have conquered; ye are not conquered;  \nNeither of the two of them hath been defeated;  \nIndra and Visnu when ye contended,  \nYe did divide the thousand into three.'\n\nThe thousand is divided into three parts at the three-night festival; verily\nhe makes her possessed of a thousand, he makes her the measure of a thousand\n[7]. He offers to her forms; verily he unites her with her forms. Rising up he\nmutters in her ear,\n\n'O Ida, Ranti, Aditi, Sarasvati, Priya, Preyasi, Mahi, Vi\xc3\xa7ruti,  \nThese, O inviolable one, are thy names;  \nProclaim me among the gods as a doer of good deeds.'\n\nVerily she proclaims him among the gods, and the gods take note of him.\n\n### vii. 1. 7.\n\nBy the thousandth the sacrifice goes to the world of heaven. She makes him go\nto the world of heaven. 'Do thou make me go to the world of heaven', he says;\nverily she makes him go to the world of heaven. 'Do thou make me go to the\nworld of light', he says; verily she makes him go to the world of light. 'Do\nthou make me go to all holy worlds', he says; verily she makes him go to all\nholy worlds [1]. 'Do thou make me go to a secure place, with offspring and\ncattle, let wealth again visit me', (he says); verily she establishes him with\noffspring and cattle in wealth. Rich in offspring, cattle, and wealth he\nbecomes who knows thus. He should give her to the Agnidh, or the Brahman, or\nthe Hotr or the Udgatr, or the Adhvaryu. In giving her, he gives a thousand. A\nthousand he accepts who not knowing [2] accepts her. He should accept her,\n(saying), 'Thou art one, not a thousand. Thee as one I accept, not a thousand;\ncome to me as one, not as a thousand'; verily he who knows thus accepts her as\none, not as a thousand. 'Thou art gentle, resting well, auspicious; come to me\nas gentle, well resting, auspicious,' [3] he says; verily she becoming gentle,\nwell resting, auspicious, comes to him, and harms him not. The theologians\nsay, 'Does the thousandth follow the thousand? or the thou sand the\nthousandth?' If he were to let her go to the east, the thousandth would follow\nthe thousand; now the thousand has no understanding, and would not recognize\nthe world of heaven. He lets her go to the west; the thousand follow after\nher. She knowing goes to the world of heaven. He lets her go towards the\nsacrificer. Quickly a thousand springs up. The (thousandth) is the last to be\ntaken, but the first to go to the gods.\n\n### vii. 1. 8.\n\nAtri gave offspring to Aurva who was desirous of children. She deemed herself\nempty, without strength, weak, worn out. He saw the four night rite; he\ngrasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed were four sons born for him, a\ngood Hotr, a good Udgatr, a good Adhvaryu, a good councillor. He, who knowing\nthus offers the four-night rite, has four sons born for him, a good Hotr, a\ngood Udgatr, a good Adhvaryu, a good councillor. The Pavamana (Stomas) which\nare twenty-fourfold are splendour [1]; the increasing Stomas are prosperity.\nAtri who had faith as his deity and offered sacrifices was not visited by the\nfour strengths, brilliance, power, splendour, food. He saw these four Soma\nlibations with the four Stomas; he grasped them and sacrificed with them. He\nwon brilliance with the first, power with the second, splendour with the\nthird, food with the fourth. He, who knowing thus, grasps the four Soma\nlibations with the four Stomas and sacrifices with them, wins brilliance with\nthe first, power with the second, splendour with the third, food with the\nfourth. With the success which Atri had, the sacrificer prospers.\n\n### vii. 1. 9.\n\nJamadagni desiring prosperity, sacrificed with the four-night rite. He\nprospered therein, and accordingly the two descendants of Jamadagni are not\nseen as grey-haired. That prosperity is his who knowing thus offers the four-\nnight rite. On the Upasads offerings of the sacrificial cake are made. The\nsacrificial cake is cattle; verily he wins cattle. The sacrificial cake is\nfood; verily he wins food. An eater of food and owner of cattle he becomes who\nknowing thus offers the four-day rite.\n\n### vii. 1. 10.\n\nThe year was alone in the world. He desired, 'May I create the seasons.' He\nsaw this five-night rite; he grasped it and sacrificed with it. Then indeed he\ncreated the seasons. He who- knowing thus offers the five-night rite gains\noffspring. The seasons being created were not distinguished. They saw this\nfive-night rite. They grasped it and sacrificed with it. Then they were\ndistinguished [1]. He who knowing thus offers the five-night rite is\ndistinguished from the enemy that hates him. Sarvaseni \xc3\x87auceya desired, 'May I\nbe rich in cattle.' He grasped this five-night rite and sacrificed with it.\nThen indeed he obtained a thousand cattle. He who knowing thus offers the\nfive-night rite obtains a thousand cattle. Babara Pravahani desired, 'May I be\na speaker of speech.' He grasped the five-night rite [2] and sacrificed with\nit. Then indeed he became a speaker of speech. He, who knowing thus offers the\nfive-night rite, becomes a speaker of speech, and men call him 'lord of\nspeech'. The four-night rite is incomplete; the six-night rite is redundant,\nthe correct sacrifice is the five-night rite. He who knowing thus sacrifices\nwith the five-night rite sacrifices with the correct sacrifice. The\n(sacrifices) last five nights; the year consists of five seasons [3]; verily\nhe stands firm in the year with its five seasons. Again the Pankti has five\nelements, the sacrifice is fivefold; verily he wins the sacrifice. There is an\nAgnistoma characterized by the Trivrt (Stoma); verily he wins brilliance.\nThere is a Pa\xc3\xb1cada\xc3\xa7a (Stoma); verily he wins power. There is a Saptada\xc3\xa7a\n(Stoma), for the obtainment of food; verily also he gains offspring by reason\nof it. There is an Agnistoma with the Pa\xc3\xb1cada\xc3\xa7a (Stoma), for the gaining of\nPrajapati; (it has) the characteristics of the Mahavrata, for the gaining of\nfood. There is a Vi\xc3\xa7vajit Atiratra, with all the Prstha (Stotras), for the\nwinning of all.\n\n_\n\nThe Horse Sacrifice (continued)\n\n_\n\n### vii. i. 11.\n\na On the instigation of god Savitr, I take thee with the arms of the A\xc3\xa7vins,\nwith the hands of Pusan.  \nb This bond of order they grasped  \nAt their assemblies in ages gone by, the sages;  \nTherewith the gods mastered the pressed (juice),  \nIn the Saman of order declaring the stream.  \nc Thou art surrounding; thou art the world; thou art the restrainer; thou art\nthe supporter; do thou go, with the cry of 'Hail!' to Agni Vai\xc3\xa7vanara, the\nextending.  \nd Thou art the restrainer, the ruler on earth; thou art the restrainer who\ndost restrain; thou art the supporter who dost support.  \nc For ploughing thee!

They\ngrasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed did they go to the world of\nheaven. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of six nights, go to the\nworld of heaven. (The rite) of six nights is a Sattra of the gods, for these\nPrsthas are obvious. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of six nights,\nmount evidently upon the gods. (The rite) is of six nights; the seasons are\nsix, the Prsthas are six [1]; verily by the Prsthas they mount the seasons, by\nthe seasons the year; verily in the year they find support. They proceed with\nthe Brhat and the Rathantara, (Samans). The Rathantara, is this (earth), the\nBrhat is yonder (sky); verily with them do they proceed; verily also in them\ndo they find support. These indeed are the quick paths of the sacrifice;\nverily by them do they proceed to the world of heaven. There is an Agnistoma\nwith the Trivrt (Stoma); verily they win brilliance. There is a Pa\xc3\xb1cada\xc3\xa7a\n(Stoma); verily they win power. There is a Saptada\xc3\xa7a (Stoma) [2], for the\nwinning of food; verily also by it they are propagated. There is an Ekavin\xc3\xa7a\n(Stoma), for support; verily also they place radiance in themselves. There is\na Trinava (Stoma), for con quest. There is a Trayastrin\xc3\xa7a (Stoma), for\nsupport. They should sacrifice with this (rite) of six nights with both Sadas\nand oblation-holder. The oblation-holder and the Agnidh's seat should be of\nA\xc3\xa7vattha wood, for that is heavenly. They should have wheels, for gaining the\nworld of heaven. The sacrificial post is mortar-based, for support. They go\nforward, for forward as it were is the world of heaven [3]. They go with the\nSarasvati. This is the path that goes to the gods; verily they mount upon it.\nThey go calling aloud; verily fastening misfortune on another they attain\nsupport. When ten (cows) make a hundred, then is one time to stop. Man is of a\nhundred (years of) life and of a hundred powers; verily in life and power do\nthey find support. When a hundred make a thousand, then is one time to stop.\nYonder world is measured by a thousand; verily they conquer yonder world. If\none of them perish or they be oppressed, then is one time to stop, for that is\na suitable opportunity.\n\n### vii. 2. 2.\n\nKusurubinda Auddalaki desired, 'May I be rich in cattle.' He grasped this\n(rite) of seven nights, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed did be win all the\ndomestic animals. He, who knowing thus sacrifices with (the rite) of seven\nnights, wins all domestic animals. (The rite) is of seven nights; the\ndomesticated animals are seven, the wild seven, the metres seven, for winning\nboth. There is an Agnistoma with the Trivrt (Stoma); verily he wins brilliance\n[1]. There is a Pa\xc3\xb1cada\xc3\xa7a (Stoma); verily he wins power. There is a Saptada\xc3\xa7a\n(Stoma), for the winning of food; verily also by it he is propagated. There is\nan Ekavin\xc3\xa7a (Stoma), for support; verily he places radiance in himself. There\nis a Trinava (Stoma), for conquest. There is an Agnistoma with the Pa\xc3\xb1cada\xc3\xa7a\n(Stoma) to obtain Prajapati; it has (the characteristics of) the Mahavrata, to\nwin food. There is a Vi\xc3\xa7vajit Atiratra with all the Prsthas, to conquer all.\nIf they were in the preceding days to perform the Prsthas in the obvious way,\nand similarly in the Vi\xc3\xa7vajit [2], the last day would be as when one sits down\nto a cow which has already been milked; it would not be good enough for even a\nsingle night (rite). In the preceding days they perform the Brhat and the\nRathantara. The Rathantara is this (earth), the Brhat yonder (sky); verily\nthey depart not from them; verily also in them do they find support. In that\nthey perform the Prsthas in the Vi\xc3\xa7vajit in the obvious manner, it is as when\none milks a cow which is ready to give.\n\n### vii. 2. 3.\n\nBrhaspati desired, 'May I be resplendent.' He saw this rite of eight nights,\nhe grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed did he become resplendent.\nHe, who knowing thus sacrifices with (the rite) of eight nights, becomes\nresplendent. (The rite) is of eight nights; the quarters are four, the\nintermediate quarters four; verily from the quarters he wins splendour [1].\nThere is an Agnistoma with the Trivrt (Stoma); verily he wins brilliance.\nThere is a Pa\xc3\xb1cada\xc3\xa7a (Stoma); verily he wins power. There is a Saptada\xc3\xa7a\n(Stoma), for the winning of food; verily also by it he is propagated. There is\nan Ekavin\xc3\xa7a (Stoma), for support verily he places radiance in himself. There\nis a Trinava (Stoma), for conquest. There is a Trayastrin\xc3\xa7a (Stoma), for\nsupport. There is an Agnistoma with the Pa\xc3\xb1cada\xc3\xa7a (Stoma), to obtain\nPrajapati; it has (the characteristics of) the Mahavrata, to win food. There\nis a Vi\xc3\xa7vajit Atiratra with all the Prsthas, to conquer all.\n\n### vii. 2. 4.\n\nPrajapati created offspring. They being created were ahungered. He saw this\n(rite) of nine nights, he grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed was\nhe able to help offspring, When offspring are ahungered, one should sacrifice\nwith (the rite) of nine nights, for these worlds are not fitted for them, and\nthus they are ahungered; verily he makes these worlds fitted for them, and as\nthey become fitted he becomes fit for offspring along with them; these worlds\nbecome fit for him [1], and strength he places in offspring. By means of three\nnights he makes fit this world, by means of three nights the atmosphere, by\nmeans of three nights yonder world. As a man casts thread on thread, so he\ncasts world on world, for firmness, and to avoid looseness. The Stomas are\nknown as Jyotis, Go, and Ayus. The Jyotis is this (earth), the Go the\natmosphere, the Ayus yonder (sky); verily they find support in these worlds,\nand he becomes famous among people [2]. (The rite) is of nine nights; verily\nin order he places brilliance on him. If a man be a long time ill, he should\nsacrifice with (the rite) of nine nights; for his breaths are loosened, and\nthus is he ill long; verily he supports his breaths in him, and even if his\nlife be gone, yet he lives.\n\n### vii. 2. 5.\n\nPrajapati desired, 'May I be propagated.' He saw this Da\xc3\xa7ahotr, and offered\nit. By this he created (the rite) of ten nights, and by this (rite) often\nnights he was propagated. If one is about to consecrate oneself for (the rite)\nof ten nights one should offer the Da\xc3\xa7ahotr; verily he creates by the Da\xc3\xa7ahotr\n(the rite) of ten nights, and by (the rite) of ten nights he is propagated.\nThe sacrifice of ten nights is connected with the Viraj. He, who knowing thus\nsacrifices with (the rite) of ten nights, attains the Viraj. The sacrifice of\nten nights is connected with Prajapati [1]. He, who knowing thus sacrifices\nwith (the rite) of ten nights, is propagated. Indra was on a level with the\ngods, he was not separated from them. He ran up to Prajapati; he gave him this\n(rite) of ten nights. He grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed he\nbecame separated from the other gods. He, who knowing thus sacrifices with\n(the rite) of ten nights, attains separation from the evil enemy. The\nsacrifice of ten nights has three eminences [2]; the Pa\xc3\xb1cada\xc3\xa7a (Stoma) is one\neminence; the Ekavin\xc3\xa7a one eminence, the Trayastrin\xc3\xa7a one eminence. He, who\nknowing thus sacrifices with (the rite) of ten nights, becomes thrice eminent\namong his peers. The sacrificer is the Pa\xc3\xb1cada\xc3\xa7a; the sacrificer the Ekavim\xc3\xa7a,\nthe sacrificer the Trayastrin\xc3\xa7a, and the others are the citadels. If a man\nhave witchcraft practised against him, he should sacrifice with (the rite) of\nten nights; verily he surrounds himself with the divine citadels; no harm\nwhatever can befall him, the practiser of witchcraft overcomes him not. The\ngods and the Asuras were in conflict. The gods [3] saw in (the rite) of ten\nnights the divine citadels. They surrounded themselves with them; no harm\nwhatever befell them; then the gods prospered, the Asuras were defeated. He\nwho has enemies should sacrifice with (the rite) of ten nights; verily he\nsurrounds himself with the divine citadels; no harm whatever befalls him; he\nprospers and his enemy is defeated. Stoma serves Stoma; verily he makes his\nenemy his servant. In that they perform the lesser Stoma after per forming the\ngreater there is uniformity [4]; to break the uniformity the Agnistoma Samans\nare before and after (the greater Stoma). There is an Agnistoma, with the\nTrivrt (Stoma), in praise of Agni, with verses addressed to Agni; verily he\nwins brilliance. There is an Ukthya, with the Pa\xc3\xb1cada\xc3\xa7a (Stoma), and verses\naddressed to Indra; verily he wins power. There is an Agnistoma, with the\nTrivrt (Stoma), and verses addressed to the All-gods; verily he wins\nprosperity. There is an Agni stoma, with the Saptada\xc3\xa7a (Stoma), and verses\naddressed to Prajapati, in which the Soma offering is bitter, to win food;\nverily also by it he is propagated [5]. There is an Ukthya with the Ekavin\xc3\xa7a\n(Stoma), and verses addressed to the sun, for support; verily he places\nradiance in himself. There is an Agnistoma, with the Saptada\xc3\xa7a (Stoma), and\nverses addressed to Prajapati, (called) the added oblation; verily he is\ninvited by all. There are two Agnistomas, with the Trinava (Stoma) on either\nside (of the Ukthya), with verses addressed to Indra, for conquest. There is\nan Ukthya, with the Trayastrin\xc3\xa7a (Stoma) with verses addressed to the All-\ngods, for rest. There is an Atiratra Vi\xc3\xa7vajit with all the Prsthas, for\nsupremacy.\n\n### vii. 2. 6.\n\nThe seasons, desirous of offspring, could not procure offspring. They desired,\n'May we create offspring, may we win offspring, may we procure offspring, may\nwe possess offspring.' They saw this (rite) of eleven nights; they grasped it,\nand sacrificed with it. Then indeed did they create offspring, win offspring,\nprocure offspring, and possess offspring. They became the seasons, and that is\nwhy the seasonal periods are seasonal periods. They are the children of the\nseasons, and therefore [1] they are said to be connected with the seasons.\nThose, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of eleven nights, create offspring,\nwin offspring, procure offspring, and possess offspring. There is an Atiratra\nwith the form of light; verily they place light before them, to reveal the\nworld of heaven. There is a Prsthva Sadaha; the seasons are six, the Prsthas\nare six; verily by the Prsthas they mount upon the seasons, by the seasons\nupon the year; verily in the year they find support. There is a Caturvin\xc3\xa7a;\nthe Gayatri has twenty-four syllables [2], splendour is connected with the\nGayatri; verily in the Gayatri and in splendour they find support. There is a\nCatuc\xc3\xa7atvarin\xc3\xa7a; the Tristubh has forty-four syllables, the Tristubh is power;\nverily in the Tristubh and in power they find support. There is an\nAstacatvarin\xc3\xa7a; the Jagati has forty-eight syllables, cattle are connected\nwith the Jagati; verily in the Jagati and in cattle they find support. (The\nrite) is of eleven nights, the seasons are five, the seasonal periods are\nfive; verily in the seasons, in the seasonal periods, and in the year they\nfind support and win offspring. There are Atiratras on either side, to secure\noffspring.\n\n### vii. 2. 7.\n\nHe should draw the cup for Indra and Vayu first if he desire, 'May my\noffspring accord in order of seniority.' Offspring are in accord according to\nthe arrangement of the sacrifice, and if the sacrifice is disarranged, they\nare at discord. Verily he makes his offspring in accord in order of seniority;\nthe younger does not overstep the older. He should draw the cup for Indra and\nVayu first for one who is ill. For he who is ill is separated from breath, the\ncup for Indra and Vayu is breath; verily he unites him with breath. They\nshould draw the cup for Mitra and Varuna first if when they are consecrated\none die [1]. From expiration and inspiration are they separated of whom when\nconsecrated one dies, Mitra and Varuna are expiration and inspiration; verily\nat the commencement they grasp expiration and inspiration. He should draw the\nA\xc3\xa7vina cup first who is infirm. The A\xc3\xa7vins are of the gods those who are\ninfirm, late as it were came they to the front. The A\xc3\xa7vins are the gods of him\nwho is infirm; they lead him to the front. He who desires support having\nattained prosperity should draw the \xc3\x87ukra Cup first. The \xc3\x87ukra is yonder sun,\nthis is the end; a man when he has reached the end [2] of prosperity stops;\nverily from the end he grasps the end, and becomes not worse. He who practises\nwitchcraft should draw the Manthin cup first. The Manthin vessel is a vessel\nof misfortune; verily he causes death to seize on him; swiftly does he reach\nmisfortune. He should draw the Agrayana cup first whose father and grandfather\nare holy, and who yet does not possess holiness. From speech and power is he\nseparated whose father and grandfather are holy [3], and who yet does not\npossess holiness. The Agrayana (cup) is the breast as it were and the speech\nas it were of the sacrifice; verily with speech and with power he unites him,\nthen he becomes not worse. He against whom witchcraft is practised should draw\nthe Ukthya cup first. The Ukthya vessel is the power of all vessels; verily he\nyokes him with all power. He should take as Puroruc (the verse) 'O Sarasvati,\nlead us to prosperity.' Sarasvati is speech [4]; verily with speech he yokes\nhim. 'May we go not through thee to joyless fields', he says. The joyless\nfields are those of death; verily he goes not to the fields of death. He\nshould draw full cups for one who is ill. Pain afflicts the breaths of him who\nis ill, the cups are breaths; verily he frees his breaths from pain, and even\nif his life is gone, yet he lives. He should draw full cups if rain does not\nfall. Pain afflicts the breaths of the people if rain does not fall, the cups\nare breaths; verily he frees the breaths of the people from pain, and rain\nsoon falls.\n\n### vii. 2. 8.\n\n(The cup) for Indra and Vayu is connected with the Gayatri, the opening day is\nconnected with the Gayatri, and therefore on the opening day (the cup) for\nIndra and Vayu is drawn; verily he draws it in its own abode. The \xc3\x87ukra is\nconnected with the Tristubh, the second day is connected with the Tristubh,\nand therefore on the second day the \xc3\x87ukra is drawn; verily he draws it in its\nown abode. The Agrayana is connected with the Jagati, the third day is\nconnected with the Jagati, and therefore on the third day the Agrayana is\ndrawn; verily he draws it in its own abode. In that it completes the metres,\nit completes the sacrifice [1]; in that the Agrayana is drawn on the next day,\nwhere they have seen the sacrifice, thence does he again employ it. The second\nthree nights begin with the Jagati, the Agrayana is connected with the Jagati;\nin that the Agrayana is drawn on the fourth day, he draws it in its own abode;\nverily also they revolve round their own metre. (The cup) for Indra and Vayu\nis connected with the Rathantara (Saman), the fifth day is connected with the\nRathantara, and therefore on the fifth day [2] (the cup) for Indra and Vayu is\ndrawn; verily he draws it in its own abode. The \xc3\x87ukra is connected with the\nBrhati, the sixth day is connected with the Brhati, and therefore on the sixth\nday the \xc3\x87ukra is drawn; verily he draws it in its own abode. In that it\ncompletes the metres, it completes for the second time the sacrifice; in that\nthe \xc3\x87ukra is drawn on the next day, where they have seen the sacrifice, thence\ndoes he again employ it. The third three nights begin with the Tristubh, the\n\xc3\x87ukra is connected with the Tristubh [3]; in that the \xc3\x87ukra is drawn on its\nseventh day, he draws it in its own abode, and they revolve round their own\nmetre. The Agrayana, is speech, the eighth day is speech, and therefore on the\neighth day the Agrayana is drawn; verily he draws it in its own abode. (The\ncup) for Indra and Vayu is breath, the ninth day is breath, and therefore on\nthe ninth day (the cup) for Indra and Vayu. is drawn; verily he draws it in\nits own abode. In that [4] it completes the metres, it completes for the third\ntime the sacrifice; in that (the cup) for Indra and Vayu is drawn on the next\nday, where they have seen the sacrifice, thence does he again employ it, and\nthey revolve round their own metre. They go by a trackless way leaving the\npath who start with anything except (the cup) for Indra and Vayu. The tenth\nday is the end of the sacrifice, (the cup) for Indra and Vayu is drawn on the\ntenth day; verily having reached the end of the sacrifice [5], they proceed\nfrom the trackless way to the path, and it is as when men go pushing on with a\nstrong (team). The metres set their wishes on one another's world, and the\ngods then interchanged them. The fourth day is the abode of (the cup) for\nIndra and Vayu, the Agrayana is drawn on this (day); therefore (the cup) for\nIndra and Vayu is drawn on the ninth day, the abode of the Agrayana. The fifth\nday is the abode of the \xc3\x87ukra [6], (the cup) for Indra and Vayu is drawn on\nthis (day); therefore the \xc3\x87ukra is drawn on the seventh day, the abode of (the\ncup) for Indra and Vayu. The sixth day is the abode of the Agrayana, the \xc3\x87ukra\nis drawn on this (day); therefore the Agrayana is drawn on the eighth day, the\nabode of the \xc3\x87ukra. Verily thus does he exchange the metres, and he who knows\nthus obtains interchange with the richer; verily also he causes concord in the\nsacrifice for the gods. Therefore one gives this to another.\n\n### vii. 2. 9.\n\nPrajapati desired, 'May I be propagated.' He saw this (rite) of twelve nights;\nhe grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed was he propagated. He who\ndesires, 'May I be propagated', should sacrifice with (the rite) of twelve\nnights; verily he is propagated. The theologians say, 'The sacrifices have\nAgnistomas at the beginning; why then is Atiratra first employed?' The two\nAtiratras are the eyes of the sacrifice, the two Agnistomas the pupils; if [1]\nthey were to employ the Agnistoma first, they would put the pupils outside;\ntherefore the Atiratra is employed first; verily having inserted the eyes of\nthe sacrifice they put the pupils in them. He, who knows the Gayatri to have\nsides of light, goes to the world of heaven with light and radiance. The sides\nare the Agnistomas, the eight Ukthyas in between are the body; verily the\nGayatri has sides of light. He who knows thus goes to the world of heaven with\nlight and radiance [2]. The twelve nights' (rite) is Prajapati in twelve\ndivisions. The two sides are the Atiratras, the eight Ukthyas within are the\nbody; Prajapati in such guise touches truth with the Sattra, truth is the\nbreaths; verily he touches the breaths. Those who perform the Sattra perform\nit with the breath of all people, and therefore they ask, 'Are these\nperformers of a Sattra?' Dear to people and noble is he who knows thus.\n\n### vii. 2. 10.\n\nThis (rite) with a Vai\xc3\xa7vanara on one side (only) was not able to win the world\nof heaven; it was stretched upwards and the gods piled round this Vai\xc3\xa7vanara,\nto overcome the world of heaven. The seasons made Prajapati sacrifice with it,\nand in them because of it he prospered. He prospers among the priests who\nknowing thus sacrifices with (the rite) of twelve days. They were desirous of\nobtaining (their desires) from him. He gave to the spring the sap [1], to the\nhot season barley, to the rains plants, to autumn rice, beans and sesamum to\nwinter and the cool season. Prajapati made Indra sacrifice with it. Then\nindeed did Indra become Indra; therefore they say, 'It is the sacrifice of the\ninferior', for he by it first sacrificed. He eats a corpse who accepts a\npresent at a Sattra; a human corpse or the corpse of a horse. Food is the cow;\nin that he does not purify the vessel in which they carry food, filth is\nproduced from it [2]. One should sacrifice by oneself, for Prajapati prospered\nby himself. One should be consecrated for twelve nights; the year consists of\ntwelve months, Prajapati is the year, he is Prajapati, he is born indeed who\nis born from fervour. The twelve Upasads are these four sets of three nights;\nwith the first three he prepares the sacrifice, with the second three he\ngrasps the sacrifice [3], with the third three he cleanses the vessels, and\nwith the fourth three he purifies himself within. He who eats his victim, eats\nhis flesh, who eats his sacrificial cake, eats his brains, who eats his fried\ngrain, eats his excrement, who eats his ghee, eats his marrow, who eats his\nSoma, eats his sweat, and also he eats the excrements from his head, who\naccepts (a present) at the twelve-day (rite). Therefore one should not cause\none to sacrifice with the twelve-day (rite), to avert evil.\n\n_\n\nThe Horse Sacrifice (continued)\n\n_\n\n### vii. 2. 11.\n\nTo one hail!  \nTo two hail!  \nTo three hail!  \nTo four hail!  \nTo five hail!  \nTo six hail!  \nTo seven hail!  \nTo eight hail!  \nTo nine hail!  \nTo ten hail!  \nTo eleven hail!  \nTo twelve hail!  \nTo thirteen hail!  \nTo fourteen hail!  \nTo fifteen hail!  \nTo sixteen hail!  \nTo seventeen hail!  \nTo eighteen hail!  \nTo nineteen hail!  \nTo twenty-nine hail!  \nTo thirty-nine hail!  \nTo forty-nine hail!  \nTo fifty-nine hail!  \nTo sixty-nine hail!  \nTo seventy-nine hail!  \nTo eighty-nine hail!  \nTo ninety-nine hail!  \nTo a hundred hail!  \nTo two hundred hail!  \nTo all hail!\n\n### vii. 2. 12.\n\nTo one hail!  \nTo three hail!  \nTo five hail!  \nTo seven hail!  \nTo nine hail!  \nTo eleven hail!  \nTo thirteen hail!  \nTo fifteen hail!  \nTo seventeen hail!  \nTo nineteen hail!  \nTo twenty-nine hail!  \nTo thirty-nine hail!  \nTo forty-nine hail!  \nTo fifty-nine hail!  \nTo sixty-nine hail!  \nTo seventy-nine hail!  \nTo eighty-nine hail!  \nTo ninety-nine hail!  \nTo a hundred hail!  \nTo all hail!\n\n### vii. 2. 13.\n\nTo two hail!  \nTo four hail!  \nTo six hail!  \nTo eight hail!  \nTo ton hail!  \nTo twelve hail!  \nTo fourteen hail!  \nTo sixteen hail!  \nTo eighteen hail!  \nTo twenty hail!  \nTo ninety-eight hail!  \nTo a hundred hail!  \nTo all hail!\n\n### vii. 2. 14.\n\nTo three hail!  \nTo five hail!  \nTo seven hail!  \n(Then as in 12 down to) To all hail!\n\n### vii. 2. 15.\n\nTo four hail!  \nTo eight hail!  \nTo twelve hail!  \nTo sixteen hail!  \nTo twenty hail!  \nTo ninety-six hail!  \nTo a hundred hail!  \nTo all hail!\n\n### vii. 2. 16.\n\nTo' five hail!  \nTo ten hail!  \nTo fifteen hail!  \nTo twenty hail!  \nTo ninety-five hail!  \nTo a hundred hail!  \nTo all hail!\n\n### vii. 2. 17.\n\nTo ten hail!  \nTo twenty hail!  \nTo thirty hail!  \nTo forty hail!  \nTo fifty hail!  \nTo sixty hail!  \nTo seventy hail!  \nTo eighty hail!  \nTo ninety hail!  \nTo a hundred hail!  \nTo all hail!\n\n### vii. 2. 18.\n\nTo twenty hail!  \nTo forty hail!  \nTo sixty hail!  \nTo eighty hail!  \nTo a hundred hail!  \nTo all hail!\n\n**\n\nvii. 2. 19.\n\n**\n\nTo fifty hail!  \nTo a hundred hail!  \nTo two hundred hail!  \nTo three hundred hail!  \nTo four hundred hail!  \nTo five hundred hail!  \nTo six hundred hail!  \nTo seven hundred hail!  \nTo eight hundred hail!  \nTo nine hundred hail!  \nTo a thousand hail!  \nTo all hail!\n\n### vii. 2. 20.\n\nTo a hundred hail!  \nTo a thousand hail!  \nTo ten thousand hail!  \nTo a hundred thousand hail!  \nTo ten hundred thousand hail!  \nTo ten million hail!  \nTo a hundred million hail!  \nTo a thousand million hail!  \nTo ten thousand million hail!  \nTo a hundred thousand million hail!  \nTo ten hundred thousand million hail!  \nTo dawn hail!  \nTo the dawning hail!  \nTo him that will rise hail!  \nTo the rising hail!  \nTo the risen hail!  \nTo heaven hail!  \nTo the world hail!  \nTo all hail!\n\n## PRAPATHAKA III\n\n_\n\nThe Sattras\n\n_\n\n### vii. 3. 1.\n\nThey go swiftly in that it is the tenth day. In that it is the tenth day they\nloosen their sins. He who among men going swiftly falls in with a trackless\nway, he who strikes a post, and he who stumbles, are left out. So he, who on\nthis tenth day, the Avivakya, comes to grief, is left out. If one points out\n(an error) to one who comes to grief, he seizes hold of him and comes out\nsuccessfully, and then the one who pointed out (his error) is left out [1].\nTherefore on the tenth day, the Avivakya, one should not point out (errors) to\none who comes to grief. Or rather they say, 'By that which was successful in\nthe sacrifice the gods went to the world of heaven, and overcame the Asuras by\nwhat was unsuccessful.' What is successful in the sacrifice belongs to the\nsacrificer, what is unsuccessful to his enemy. Now he, who comes to grief on\nthe tenth day, the Avivakya, produces overmuch. Those who are outside as\nspectators [2] should point out (his error). If there be none there, then (the\nerror) should be pointed out from within the Sadas. If there be none there,\nthen it should be pointed out by the Grhapati. At any rate it should be\npointed out. They sing the verses of the serpent queen on that day. The queen\nof what creeps is this (earth). Whatever on this (earth) they praise, whatever\nthey have praised, through that is this (earth) the serpent queen. Now\nwhatever they have praised with speech and what they will praise thereafter,\n(it is done thinking), 'Having won both and obtained them, let us stop.' They\nsing these (verses) with the mind. Neither a horse chariot nor a mule chariot\ncan in one moment encompass this (earth), but mind can in one moment encompass\nit, mind can overcome it. Then they repeat the Brahman. The Rc verses are\nlimited, the Samans are limited, and the Yajuses are limited, but of the\nBrahman there is no end, and that he should declare to the one who responds.\nThat is the response.\n\n### vii. 3. 2.\n\nThe theologians say, 'By the first day of the twelve-day rite what is it that\nthe sacrificer takes from the priests?' 'Brilliance and power' is (the\nanswer). 'What by the second?' 'The breaths and food.' 'What by the third?'\n'These three worlds.' 'What by the fourth?' 'Four-footed cattle.' 'What by the\nfifth?' 'The Pankti with its elements.' 'What by the sixth?' 'The six\nseasons.' 'What by the seventh?' 'The \xc3\x87akvari with its seven feet.' 'What by\nthe eighth?' 'The Gayatri with its eight syllables.' 'What by the ninth?' 'The\nTrivrt Stoma.' 'What by the tenth?' 'The Viraj with its ten syllables.' 'What\nby the eleventh?' 'The Tristubh with its eleven syllables.' 'What by the\ntwelfth?' 'The Jagati with its twelve syllables.' So much is there as that. So\nmuch as that he takes from them.\n\n### vii. 3. 3.\n\n(The rite) of thirteen nights is a complete (rite of) twelve days, for the\nopening and concluding days are the same. There are three Atiratras, three are\nthese worlds, for the obtaining of these worlds. The first Atiratra is the\nexpiration, the second cross-breathing, the third inspiration; verily they\nfind support in expiration, inspiration, out-breathing, and food, and reach\ntheir full life, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of thirteen nights. They\nsay, '(The rite) of twelve days is the sequence of speech. They would cleave\nit if they put an Atiratra in the middle, and the speech of the householder\nwould be liable to fail.' They perform the Mahavrata after the Chandomas;\nverily they maintain the sequence of speech, and the speech of the householder\nis not likely to fail. The Chandomas are cattle, the Mahavrata food; in that\nthey perform the Mahavrata after the Chandomas, they find support in cattle\nand in food.\n\n### vii. 3. 4.\n\nThe Adityas desired, 'May we be prosperous in both worlds.' They saw this\n(rite) of fourteen nights; they grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then\nindeed they prospered in both worlds, this and yonder. Those, who knowing thus\nperform (the rite) of fourteen nights, prosper in both worlds, this and\nyonder. (The rite) is of fourteen nights, there are seven domesticated plants\nand seven wild; (verily it serves) to win both. In that the Prsthas are\nperformed in succession [1], they conquer by them yonder world. In that the\nPrsthas are reversed, they conquer by them this world. There are two\nTrayastrin\xc3\xa7a Stomas in the middle; verily they attain sovereignty. (These two)\nare overlords; verily they become overlords of their peers. There are\nAtiratras on either side, for security.\n\n### vii. 3. 5.\n\nPrajapati went to the world of heaven. The gods followed him, and the Adityas\nand the cattle followed them. The gods said, 'The cattle on which we have\nlived have followed us.' They arranged this (rite) of fourteen nights away for\nthem. The Adityas mounted the world of heaven with the Prsthas; they arranged\nthe cattle in this world with the two Tryahas. By means of the Prsthas the\nAdityas prospered in yonder world, the cattle in this world by the Tryahas\n[1]. Those who, knowing thus, perform (the rite of) fourteen nights, prosper\nin both worlds, in this and in yonder; by the Prsthas they prosper in yonder\nworld and by the Tryahas in this world. The three days are the Jyotis, Go, and\nAyus. The Jyotis is this (earth), the Go the atmosphere, the Ayus yonder\n(sky); verily they mount upon these worlds. If the Prsthas were on one side,\nthere would be a lack of balance; the Prsthas are in the middle, for balance\n[2]. The Prsthas are force and strength; verily they place force and strength\nin the middle. They proceed with the Brhat and the Rathantara (Samans). The\nRathantara is this (earth), the Brhat yonder (sky); verily with them do they\nproceed; verily also in them they find support. These indeed are the quick\npaths of the sacrifice; verily by them do they proceed to the world of heaven.\nThey mount the world of heaven turning away (from earth), who perform the\nPrsthas in succession. The Tryaha is reversed, for the return (from heaven),\nand for support. Having prospered in either world they cease (the rite). The\n(nights) are fourteen. As for ten of them, the Viraj is ten-syllabled, the\nViraj is food; verily by the Viraj they win food. As for four, the quarters\nare four; verily they find support in the quarters. There are Atiratras on\neither side, for security.\n\n### vii. 3. 6.\n\nIndra was on a level with the gods, he was not distinguished from them. He ran\nup to Prajapati; he gave him this (rite) of fifteen nights. He grasped it, and\nsacrificed with it. Then indeed he became distinguished from the other gods.\nThose who knowing thus perform (the rite) of fifteen nights attain distinction\nfrom the evil enemy. The three days are Jyotis, Go, and Ayus. The Jyotis is\nthis (earth), the Go the atmosphere [1], the Ayus yonder (sky); verily they\nfind support in these worlds. There can be no Sattra where there is no\nChandoma; in that there axe Chandomas, there is the Sattra. The gods they win\nby the Prsthas, the cattle by the Chandomas. The Prsthas are force and\nstrength, the strength, and in cattle, they Chandomas cattle; verily in force\nand find support. (The rite) is of fifteen nights; the bolt is fifteenfold;\nverily they hurl the bolt at their enemies. There are Atiratras on either\nside, for securing power.\n\n### vii. 3. 7.\n\nIndra was as it were loose and unfixed. He was afraid of the Asuras. He ran up\nto Prajapati; he gave him this (rite) of fifteen nights as a bolt. With it he\novercame and conquered the Asuras and attained prosperity. By the Agnistut he\nburned away the evil, by (the rite) of fifteen nights he placed force, might,\npower, and strength in himself. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of\nfifteen nights overcome and conquer their enemies and attain prosperity. By\nthe Agnistut they burn away the evil [1], by (the rite) of fifteen nights they\nplace force, might, power, and strength in themselves. These (nights) are full\nof cattle. Fifteen indeed are the nights of the half-month, the year is made\nup of half-months, cattle are born throughout the year; therefore (these\nnights) are full of cattle. These (nights) are heavenly. Fifteen indeed are\nthe nights of the half-month, the year is made up of half-months, the world of\nheaven is the year; verily (these nights) are heavenly. There are the three\ndays, Jyotis, Ayus, and Go. The Jyotis is this (earth), the Go the atmosphere\n[2], the Ayus yonder (sky); verily they mount upon these worlds. If the\nPrsthas were on one side, there would be a lack of balance; the Prsthas are in\nthe middle, for balance. The Prsthas are force and strength; verily they place\nforce and strength in the middle. They proceed with the Brhat and the\nRathantara (Samans). The Rathantara is this (earth), the Brhat yonder (sky);\nverily with them do they proceed; verily also in them they find support. These\nindeed are the quick paths of the sacrifice; verily by them do they proceed to\nthe world of heaven [3]. They mount the world of heaven turning away (from\nearth), who perform the Prsthas in succession. The Tryaha is reversed, for the\nreturn (from heaven), and for support. Having prospered in either world they\ncease (the rite). These (nights) are fifteen. As for ten of them, the Viraj is\nten-syllabled, the Viraj is food; verily by the Viraj they win food. As for\nfive, the quarters are five; verily they find support in the quarters. There\nare Atiratras on either side, for securing power, strength, offspring, and\ncattle.\n\n### vii. 3. 8.\n\nPrajapati desired, 'May I be an eater of food.' He saw this (rite of)\nseventeen nights; he grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed he became\nan eater of food. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of seventeen\nnights, become eaters of food. There is a period of five days; the seasons are\nfive in the year; verily in the seasons and the year they find sup port. Again\nthe Pankti is of five elements, the sacrifice is fivefold; verily they win the\nsacrifice. There can be no Sattra where there is no Chandoma; in that there\nare Chandomas, there is the sacrifice. The gods they win by the Prsthas, the\ncattle by the Chandomas. The Prsthas are force and strength, the Chandomas\ncattle; verily in force and strength, and in cattle, they find support. (The\nrite is) of seventeen nights; Prajapati is seventeenfold; (verily it serves)\nto obtain Prajapati. There are Atiratras on either side, for securing food.\n\n### vii. 3. 9.\n\nThe Viraj dividing itself stayed among the gods with the holy power (Brahman),\namong the Asuras with food. The gods desired, 'May we acquire both the holy\npower (Brahman) and food! They saw (the rite of) these twenty nights. Then\nindeed they acquired both the holy power (Brahman) and food, and became\nresplendent and eaters of food. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite of)\nthese nights, acquire both the holy power (Brahman) and food [1], and become\nresplendent and eaters of food. They (make up) two Virajs; verily separately\nin them they find support. Man is twentyfold, ten fingers and ten toes; verily\nobtaining the greatness of man they cease (the rite). There are Tryahas\nconsisting of Jyotis, Go, and Ayus. The Jyotis is this (earth), the Go the\natmosphere, the Ayus yonder (sky); verily they mount upon these worlds. The\nTryahas go in order; verily in order they mount the world of heaven [2]. If\nthe Prsthas were on one side there would be a lack of balance; the Prsthas are\nin the middle, for balance. The Prsthas are force and strength; verily they\nplace force and strength in the middle. They proceed with the Brhat and the\nRathantara (Samans). The Rathantara is this (earth), the Brhat yonder (sky);\nverily with them do they proceed, verily also in them they find support. These\nindeed are the quick paths of the sacrifice; verily by them do they proceed to\nthe world of heaven. They mount the world of heaven turning away (from earth),\nwho perform the Prsthas in succession. The Tryaha is re versed, for the return\n(from heaven), and for support. Having prospered in either world they cease\n(the rite). There are Atiratras on either side, for securing splendour and\nfood.\n\n### vii. 3. 10.\n\nYonder sun was in this world. The gods surrounded it with the Prsthas and\nremoved it to the world of heaven. They surrounded it from below with the Para\n(Samans), and placed it with the Divakirtya (Saman) in the world of heaven.\nThey surrounded it from above with the Para (Samans), and with the Prsthas\nthey descended (from heaven). Yonder sun indeed in yonder world is surrounded\nby the Para (Samans) on both sides. In that there are Prsthas the sacrificers\ngo by them to the world of heaven; they surround it from below with the Para\n(Samans), and by the Divakirtya (Saman) find support [1] in the world of\nheaven. They surround it from above with the Para (Samans), and descend with\nthe Prsthas. If there were not Paras above, they would depart away from the\nworld of heaven; if there were none below, they would. burn creatures. There\nare Parahsamans on both sides of the Divakirtya; verily they surround them on\nboth sides in the world of heaven. The Divakirtya is the sacrificers, the\nParahsamans the year; the Parahsamans are on both sides of the Divakirtya;\nverily on both sides [2] they find support in the year. The Divakirtya is the\nback, the Parahsamans the two sides; the Parahsamans are on both sides of the\nDivakirtya; therefore the sides are on both sides of the back. (In the rite)\nthe greatest number of libations are made, the greatest number of \xc3\x87astras\nrecited; verily in the middle of the sacrifice they tie a knot not to slip.\nThere are seven libations; seven are the breaths in the head; verily they\nplace breaths in the sacrificers. In that the Prsthas are in succession, they\nmount upon yonder world with them. If they were not to descend to this world\n[3], the sacrificers would either go mad or perish. In that the Prsthas are\nreversed they descend to this world with them; verily also they find support\nin this world, for sanity. Indra was unsettled. He ran up to Prajapati; he\ngave him this (rite) of twenty-one nights; he grasped it, and sacrificed with\nit. Then indeed he became settled. Those, who sacrifice much and are unsettled\n[41, should perform (the rite) of twenty-one nights. There are twelve months,\nfive seasons, three worlds here, and yonder sun as the twenty-first. So many\nare the worlds of the gods; verily in them in order they find support. Yonder\nsun did not shine. He ran up to Prajapati; he gave him this (rite) of twenty-\none nights; he grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then in deed did he shine.\nThose, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of twenty one nights, shine also.\n(The rite) is of twenty-one nights, the Ekavin\xc3\xa7a (Stoma) is radiance; verily\nthey attain radiance, and support also, for the Ekavin\xc3\xa7a is support. There are\nAtiratras on either side, for securing splendour.\n\n_\n\nThe Horse Sacrifice (continued)\n\n_\n\n### vii. 3. 11.\n\na Let the sacrifice come forward  \nFrom yonder over to me,  \nThe sacrifice which the Rsis have brought forward.  \nb May the fault in the sacrifice settle on him who hateth us,  \nMaking his body godless, strengthless,  \nDistorted and inert;  \nMay it rest with him who hateth us.  \nc O sacrifice, come to me  \nWith the brilliance of the sacrifice.  \nI summon the Brahmans, the priests, the gods,  \nWith the brilliance of thee, the sacrifice, O offering.  \nd With the sacrifice I summon the cooked food [1] to thee, O offering.  \nI gather for thee good deeds, offspring, and cattle.  \ne The Praisas, the kindling-(verses), the butter sprinklings, the shares of\nthe ghee,  \nThe call, the reply, I prepare for thee,  \nThe fore- and after-sacrifices, the Svisakrt, the Ida.  \nThe prayers, I win, the light.  \nf By Agni, by Indra, by Soma,  \nBy Sarasvati, by Visnu, by the gods,  \nBy the Yajya and the Anuvakya, I summon for thee, O offering.  \nI take for thee the sacrifice with the Vasat cry.  \ng The chant, the \xc3\x87astra, the response,  \nThe libation, the Ida, the prayers, I win, the light.  \nI summon for thee the sacrifices of the wives, O offering,  \nI take thy I offering and sacrificial utterance.  \nh Cattle, the pressed (Soma), the sacrificial cakes,  \nThe pressings, the sacrifice,  \nThe gods with Indra, I summon for thee, O offering,  \nLead by Agni, with Soma, and them all.\n\n### vii. 3. 12.\n\nThe past, the present, the future, Vasat, hail, reverence!  \nThe Rc, the Saman, the Yajus, Vasat, hail, reverence!  \nThe Gayatri, the Tristubh, the Jagati, Vasat, hail, reverence!  \nThe earth, the atmosphere, the sky, Vasat, hail, reverence!  \nAgni, Vayu, Surya, Vasat, hail, reverence!  \nExpiration, cross-breathing, inspiration, Vasat, hail, reverence!  \nFood, ploughing, rain, Vasat, hail, reverence!  \nFather, son, grandson, Vasat, hail, reverence!  \nBhuh, Bhuvah, Suvar, Vasat, hail, reverence!\n\n### vii. 3. 13.\n\na May a house be mine, may offspring be mine;  \nMay the strong sacrifice come to me.  \nMay the divine and holy waters come to me;  \nMay the abundance of a thousandfold (wealth) fail me not.  \nb May the cup be mine; may the Puroruc be mine;  \nMay the chant and the \xc3\x87astra come to me in union.  \nMay the Adityas, the Rudras, the Vasus, be present at the rite;  \nMay the abundance of a thousandfold (wealth) fail me not.  \nc May the Agnistoma, come to me, and the Ukthya;  \nMay the nocturnal Atiratra come to me.  \nMay the (draughts) which have stood over night, well offered, come to me;  \nMay the abundance of a thousandfold (wealth) fail me not.\n\n### vii. 3. 14.\n\nBy fire he surmounted fervour, by speech holy power, by a gem forms, by Indra\nthe gods, by the wind the breaths, by the sun the sky, by the moon the\nNaksatras, by Yama the Pitrs, by the king men, by fruit the flavours, by the\nboa constrictor serpents, by the tiger wild beasts, by the eagle birds, by the\nstallion horses, by the bull kine, by the he-goat goats, by the ram sheep, by\nrice food, by barley plants, by the banyan trees, by the Udumbara strength, by\nthe Gayatri the metres, by the Trivrt the Stomas, by the Brahmana speech.\n\n### vii. 3. 15.\n\nHail!

He saw this (rite) of twenty-four nights; he grasped it, and\nsacrificed with it. Then the gods had faith in him, and he became their\nPurohita. In those who knowing thus perform the twenty four night (rite) men\nhave faith, and they become their Purohitas. There are the three days Jyotis,\nGo, and Ayus. The Jyotis is this (earth), the Go the atmosphere, and the Ayus\nyonder (sky) [1]; verily they mount upon these worlds. The three days occur in\norder; verily in order do they mount upon the world of heaven. There can be no\nSattra where there is no Chandoma; in that there are Chandomas, there is the\nSattra. The gods they win by the Prsthas, the cattle by the Chandomas. The\nPrsthas are force and strength, the Chandomas cattle; verily in force and\nstrength, and in cattle they find support. They proceed with the Brhat and the\nRathantara (Samans). The Rathantara, is this (earth), the Brhat yonder (sky);\nverily with them do they [2] proceed; verily also in them they find support.\nThese indeed are the quick paths of the sacrifice; verily by them do they\nproceed to the world of heaven. (The rite is one) of twenty-four nights.\nTwenty four half-months make up the year; the year is the world of heaven;\nverily they find support in the year, the world of heaven. Now the Gayatri is\nof twenty-four syllables; the Gayatri is splendour; verily by the Gayatri they\nwin splendour. There are Atiratras on either side, to secure splendour.\n\n### vii. 4. 2.\n\nAs are men, so were the gods in the beginning. They desired, 'Let us strike\noff the misfortune, the evil of death, and reach the conclave of the gods.'\nThey saw this twenty-four night (rite); they grasped it, and sacrificed with\nit. Then they struck off the misfortune, the evil of death, and reached the\nconclave of the gods. Those who knowing thus perform the twenty-four night\n(rite) strike off the misfortune, the evil, and win prosperity, for the\nconclave of the gods is in the case of man [1] prosperity. The Atiratra is\nlight, for the lighting up of the world of heaven. There is a Prsthva Sadaha.\nThe year consists of six seasons, and, entering it, the months, the half-\nmonths and the seasons reached the conclave of the gods. Those who knowing\nthus perform the twenty-four night rite, entering the year, reach a better\nstation. There are three Trayastrin\xc3\xa7as before, and three Trayastrin\xc3\xa7as behind;\nverily with Trayastrin\xc3\xa7as on either hand they strike off the evil of\nmisfortune and in the middle reach the conclave of the gods [2], for the\nconclave of the gods is the Prsthas. There is uniformity in that there are\nthree Trayastrin\xc3\xa7as in succession, and a break in the uniformity in that there\nis in the middle one which is not defined. The Prsthas go onwards, the\nChandomas go onwards; with both forms they go to the world of heaven. There\ncan be no Sattra where there is no Chandoma; in that there are Chandomas,\nthere is the Sattra. The gods they win by the Prsthas, the cattle by the\nChandomas. The Prsthas are force and strength, the Chandomas cattle [3];\nverily in force and strength and in cattle they find support. There are three\nTrayastrin\xc3\xa7as before, and three Trayastrin\xc3\xa7as behind; in the middle there are\nthe Prsthas. The Trayastrin\xc3\xa7as are the breast, the Prsthas the breath; verily\nthus the sacrificers don a protection for the breath, to avoid injury. They\nproceed with the Brhat and the Rathantara. The Rathantara is this (world), the\nBrhat yonder (world); verily they proceed with them; verily also in them they\nfind support. These indeed are the quick paths of the sacrifice; verily by\nthem do they [4] proceed to the world of heaven. They mount the world of\nheaven turning away (from earth) who perform the Prsthas in succession. The\nsix-day (rite) is reversed for the return (from the heaven), and for support.\nHaving prospered in either world they cease (the rite). They go from a Trivrt\nto a Trivrt, for the attainment of the Stomas, for pre eminence. There is an\nAgnistoma in the Jyotis form. This dwelling is this (world); verily by reason\nthereof they depart not from this dwelling. (The rite is one) of twenty-four\nnights. Twenty-four half-months make up the year, the year is the world of\nheaven; verily they find support in the year, the world of heaven. Now the\nGayatri is of twenty-four syllables; the Gayatri is splendour; verily by the\nGayatri they win splendour. There are Atiratras on either side, to secure\nsplendour.\n\n### vii. 4. 3.\n\nThis (earth) was bare and hairless. It desired, 'Let me be propagated with\nplants and trees.' It saw these thirty nights. Then indeed it was propagated\nwith plants and trees. Those who desire offspring and cattle should perform\n(the rite of) these (nights); they are propagated with offspring and cattle.\nThis (earth) was hungry. It saw this Viraj, and placing it within itself it\nwon food, plants [1], trees, offspring, cattle. Thereby it grew, it attained\nvictoriousness and greatness. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite of)\nthese (nights), placing the Viraj in themselves, win food, grow great with\noffspring and cattle, and attain victoriousness and might. There is a\nJyotistoma Atiratra, for the revealing of the world of heaven. There is a\nPrsthya Sadaha. The seasons are six, the Prsthas are six; verily by the\nPrsthas they reach the seasons, with the seasons the year; verily; the year\n[2] they find support. From the Trayastrin\xc3\xa7as they go to the Trayastrin\xc3\xa7a, for\nthe continuity of the sacrifice. Now the Trayastrin\xc3\xa7a is Prajapati; verily\nthey seize hold of Prajapati, for support. There is a Trinava, for victory.\nThere is an Ekavin\xc3\xa7a, for support; verily they place radiance in themselves.\nThere is a praise of Agni with the Trivrt; verily they bum away evil with it.\nNow the Trivrt is brilliance; verily they place brilliance in themselves.\nThere is a praise of Indra with the Pa\xc3\xb1cada\xc3\xa7a; verily they win power ( _indriy\na_) [3]. There is a Saptada\xc3\xa7a, for the winning of food; verily by it they are\npropagated. There is an Ekavin\xc3\xa7a, for support; verily they place radiance in\nthemselves. There is a Caturvin\xc3\xa7a. Twenty-four half-months make up the year,\nthe year is the world of heaven; verily they find support in the year, the\nworld of heaven. Now there is the chief (day), and those who knowing thus\nperform (the rite of) these (nights) become the chief. From the Caturvin\xc3\xa7a\nthey go to the Prsthas. Verily having found support in the year [4] they\nattain the gods. From the Trayastrin\xc3\xa7a they go to the Trayastrin\xc3\xa7a. The gods\nare three and thirty; verily in the gods they find support. There is a\nTrinava. The Trinava is these worlds; verily in these worlds they find\nsupport. There are two Ekavin\xc3\xa7as, for support; verily they place radiance in\nthemselves. There are many Soda\xc3\xa7ins, and therefore there are many males among\noffspring. In that these Stomas are intermingled, therefore this (earth) is\ncovered with mingled plants and trees [5]. Those who knowing thus perform (the\nrite of) these (nights) have both offspring and cattle. These go imperfect to\nthe world of heaven, for they resort to various Stomas; in that the Stomas are\narranged in order, they go in order to the world of heaven, and there is order\nin both these worlds. These (nights) are thirty in number, the Viraj has\nthirty syllables; verily by the Viraj they win food. There are Atiratras on\neither hand, to secure food.\n\n### vii. 4. 4.\n\nPrajapati went to the world of heaven. But with whatever metre the gods yoked\nhim, they achieved not him. They saw (the rite of) these thirty-two nights.\nThe Anustubh has thirty-two syllables, Prajapati is connected with the\nAnustubh; verily having gained Prajapati by his own metre they mounted on him\nand went to the world of heaven. Those who knowing thus perform (the rite of)\nthese thirty-two (nights)--the Anustubh has thirty-two syllables, Prajapati is\nconnected with the Anustubh-gaining Prajapati by his own metre, go to\nprosperity [1], for the world of heaven for man is prosperity. These (nights)\nare thirty-two, the Anustubh has thirty-two syllables, the Anustubh is speech;\nverily they gain all speech; all become speakers of speech, for all attain\nprosperity. There are the three days, Jyotis, Go, and Ayus. The Jyotis is this\n(earth), the Go the atmosphere, and the Ayus yonder (sky); verily they mount\nupon these worlds. The three days occur in order; verily in order do they\nmount upon the world of heaven. They proceed with the Brhat and Rathantara\n(Samans) [2]. The Rathantara is this (earth), the Brhat yonder (sky); verily\nwith them do they proceed; verily also in them they find support. These indeed\nare the quick paths of the sacrifice; verily by them do they proceed to the\nworld of heaven. Those who perform the three days in succession mount upon the\nworld of heaven turning away (from earth). There is a three day period\nreversed, for returning (from heaven), and also for support. Having prospered\nin both worlds they cease (the rite). These (nights) are thirty-two. As for\nthirty of them, the Viraj has thirty syllables, the Viraj is food; verily by\nthe Viraj they win food. As for the (remaining) two, they are days and nights,\nand by both forms they go to the world of heaven. There are Atiratras on\neither side, for security.\n\n### vii. 4. 5.\n\nThere are two Sattras of the gods, that of twelve days and that of thirty-\nthree days. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite of) thirty-three days,\nmount openly upon the deities. As a great man who has reached (the goal) seeks\n(more), so he does. If he fail he becomes worse; if he fail not, he remains\nthe same. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite of) thirty-three days, are\ndistinguished from the evil enemy. The gods in the beginning seized these\n(nights), sharing the days [1]. One took one day, one another, and with them\nall equally prospered. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of thirty-\nthree days, all equally prosper, all gain the rank of village chief. There are\nfive day periods; the year has five seasons; verily they rest on the seasons,\nthe year. Again the Pankti has five syllables, the sacrifice is fivefold;\nverily they win the sacrifice. There are three (days with the) A\xc3\xa7vina\n(\xc3\x87astra); three are these worlds; verily in these [2] worlds they find\nsupport. Again three are the powers of the sacrifice; verily they win them.\nThere is a Vi\xc3\xa7vajit (day), for the winning of food. It has all the Prsthas,\nfor the conquest of all. The twelve-day (rite) is speech. If they were to\nperform the twelve-day (rite) before (what has already gone), they would\nperform speech imperfectly, and their speech would be likely to fail. They\nperform the twelve-day (rite) afterwards; verily they perform speech\nperfectly, and therefore we utter speech from above. Intermediately indeed [3]\nby means of a ten-nights' (rite) did Prajapati create offspring. In that there\nis a ten-nights' (rite), the sacrificers create offspring. Udanka \xc3\x87aulbayana\nhas declared the ten-night rite to be the prosperity of the Sattra. In that\nthere is a ten-nights' rite, (it serves) for the prosperity of the Sattra.\nVerily also whatever is wrongly done in the former days, it serves to atone.\nThese nights form two rows, the sacrificers are the Vi\xc3\xa7vajit, the first are\nsixteen with the Atiratra, the second are sixteen with the Atiratra. To those,\nwho knowing thus perform (the rite) of thirty-three days, are born children in\ntwo rows. There are Atiratras on either side, for security.\n\n### vii. 4. 6.\n\nThe Adityas desired, 'Let us go to the world of heaven.' They discerned not\nthe world of heaven, they went not to the world of heaven. They saw this\n(rite) of thirty-six nights; they grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then\nindeed did they discern the world of heaven, and went to the world of heaven.\nThose, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of thirty six nights, discern the\nworld of heaven, and go to the world of heaven. The Atiratra is light [1];\nverily they put light before them, to reveal the world of heaven. There are\nSadahas; six are the seasons; verily in the seasons they find support. There\nare four (Sadahas); four are the quarters; verily in the quarters they find\nsupport. There can be no Sattra where there is no Chandoma; in that there are\nChandomas, there is the Sattra. The gods they win by the Prsthas, the cattle\nby the Chandomas. The Prsthas are force and strength, the Chandomas cattle;\nverily in force [2] and strength they find support. (The rite has) thirty-six\nnights; the Brhati has thirty-six syllables, cattle are connected with the\nBrhati; verily by the Brhati they win cattle. The Brhati obtained the\nsovereignty over the metres. They obtain sovereignty who knowing thus perform\n(the rite) of thirty-six nights; verily they go to the world of heaven. There\nare Atiratras on either side, for the securing of the world of heaven.\n\n### vii. 4. 7.\n\nVasistha, his sons slain, desired, 'May I win offspring, and defeat the\nSauddsas.' He saw this (rite) of forty-nine nights; he grasped it, and\nsacrificed with it. Then indeed did he win offspring and defeated the\nSauddsas. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of forty-nine nights, win\noffspring and defeat their enemies. There are three Agnistomas with the\nTrivrt; verily they sharpen the point of the bolt. There are ten Pa\xc3\xb1cada\xc3\xa7as;\nthe bolt is fifteenfold [1]; verily they take away the bolt from their rivals.\nThe tenth day has a Soda\xc3\xa7in; verily they place strength in the bolt. There axe\ntwelve Saptada\xc3\xa7as, to win food; verily also they are propagated by them. There\nis a Prsthya Sadaha. Six are the seasons, six the Prsthas; verily by the\nPrsthas they mount upon the seasons, by the seasons upon the year; verily in\nthe year they find support. There are twelve Ekavin\xc3\xa7as, for support; verily\nthey place radiance in themselves [2]. There are many Soda\xc3\xa7ins, for conquest.\nThere are six (days) with the A\xc3\xa7vina (\xc3\x87astra), six are the seasons; verily\nthey rest on the seasons. These nights are deficient and redundant. They are\ndeficient in that they are fifty less one, redundant in that they are (one)\nmore than forty-eight. Both from the deficient, indeed, and from the redundant\nPrajapati was propagated. Those who desire offspring and cattle should perform\n(the rite of) these nights; verily are they propagated with offspring and\ncattle. This sacrifice is connected with the Viraj because it is one of forty-\nnine (nights). Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of forty-nine\nnights, attain the Viraj, and become eaters of food. There are Atiratras on\neither side, for the securing of food.\n\n### vii. 4. 8.\n\nThose who are about to consecrate themselves for the year (rite) should\nconsecrate themselves on the Ekastaka. The Ekastaka is the wife of the year;\non that night he dwells with her; verily they consecrate themselves grasping\nopenly the year. Those who consecrate themselves on the Ekastaka consecrate\nthemselves in the troubled part of the year, for then are the two months\ncalled the end. Those who consecrate themselves on the Ekastaka consecrate\nthemselves on the torn part of the year, for them are the two seasons called\nthe end. They should consecrate themselves on the full moon in Phalguni. The\nfull moon in Phalguni is the beginning of the year [1]; verily they consecrate\nthem selves grasping the year at its beginning. To that there is this one\nobjection that the Visuvant day falls in the cloudy season. They should\nconsecrate themselves on the full moon in Citra. The full moon in Citra, is\nthe beginning of the year; verily they consecrate themselves grasping the year\nat the beginning. In that there is no objection at all. They should consecrate\nthemselves on the fourth day before the full moon. Then the buying (of the\nSoma) falls for them on the Ekastaka; verily they do not waste the Ekastaka.\nIn their case [2] the pressing-(day) falls on the first half (of the month),\nthe months end in the first half, they complete (the rite) in the first half,\nand when they complete the rite the plants and trees come out after them. And\nafter them follows the fair report, 'These sacrificers have succeeded', and\ntherefore all succeed.\n\n### vii. 4. 9.\n\nThey go to the world of heaven who perform the Sattra. They kindle themselves\nwith the Diksas, and cook themselves with the Upasads. With two they cut off\ntheir hair, with two their skin, with two their blood, with two their flesh,\nwith two their bones, with two their marrow. In the Sattra the self is the\nsacrificial gift; verily taking the self as the gift they go to the world of\nheaven. They cut off the top-knot, for prosperity, (thinking), 'More swiftly\nmay we attain the world of heaven.'\n\n### vii. 4. 10.\n\nThe theologians say, 'The Atiratra is the highest of the forms of sacrifice.\nWhy do they perform it first?' Now in doing so they really perform in order\nfirst the Agnistoma, then the Ukthya, then the Soda\xc3\xa7in, then the Atiratra, all\nthe forms of sacrifice, and seizing and holding them, they keep drinking the\nSoma. They perform the Jyotistoma first; the Jyotistoma is the beginning of\nthe Stomas; verily they commence the Stomas from the beginning [1]. The Stomas\nbeing sung together make up the Viraj, and two verses are redundant; the\nGostoma has one too many, and the Ayustoma one too few. The Jyotistoma is the\nworld of heaven, the Viraj is strength; verily by it they go to the world of\nheaven. 'The Rathantara is used in the day, the Rathantara at night', say the\ntheologians, 'what is used to avoid repetition?' The great Saman of Sobhari is\nused as the Brahmasaman at the third pressing; it they place in the middle, to\nseparate them; verily there is no repetition.\n\n### vii. 4. 11.\n\nThey first perform the Jyotistoma; verily by it they find support in this\nworld. They perform secondly the Gostoma; verily by it they find support in\nthe atmosphere. They perform thirdly the Ayustoma; verily by it they find\nsupport in yonder world. The Jyotis is this (earth), the Go the atmosphere,\nand the Ayus yonder (sky). In that they perform these Stomas, the performers\nof the Sattra keep finding support in these worlds. These, (Stomas) being sung\ntogether make up the Viraj [1], and two verses are redundant; the Gostoma has\none too many, and the Ayustoma one too few. The Jyotistoma is the world of\nheaven, the Viraj is strength; verily they win strength. They experience not\nmisery through hunger, and are not hungry, for the performers of Sattras are\nas it were afflicted with hunger. The two Agnistomas on either side are the\nrims, the Ukthyas in the middle the nave, and that is the circling wheel of\nthe gods. In that they go [2] by that Sadaha, they mount the wheel of the\ngods, for safety. They obtain prosperity. They go with the Sadaha; there are\nsix seasons; verily in the seasons they find support. The go with a Jyotistoma\non either hand; verily on either hand they find support in the world of\nheaven. There are two Sadahas, they make up twelve days. Man is of twelve\nparts, two thighs, two arms, the trunk and the head, four members, and the\nbreasts as the eleventh and twelfth [3]. Therefore (the days) follow man.\nThere are three Sadahas, they make up eighteen days, nine and nine. Nine are\nthe breaths in man; verily they follow the breaths. There are four Sadahas,\nthey make up twenty-four days. The year consists of twenty-four half-months;\nverily they follow the year. 'The year is not fixed', they say. 'It is greater\nthan a support.' The Brahmana of the month is that of the year also verily\nthey go finding support in each month.\n\n_\n\nThe Horse Sacrifice (continued)\n\n_\n\n### vii. 4. 12.\n\na Let the ram aid thee with cooked food, the dark-necked with goats, the\ncotton-tree with increase, the Parna-tree with the holy power (Brahman), the\nfig-tree with the sacrifice, the banyan with the beakers, the Udumbara with\nstrength, the Gayatri with the metres, the Trivrt with the Stomas. b Ye are\nhelpers; let the helpers help thee.

For ten months they performed it, and then horns were born, and\nthey ceased (the rite), (saying), 'We have obtained (our desire).' Then those\nwhose horns were not born ceased (the rite) after making up the year,\n(saying), 'We have obtained (our desire).' Both those which obtained horns and\nthose which did not ceased, (saying),'We have obtained (our desire).' The year\nis the cows' Sattra [1], and those who knowing thus perform the year\n(sacrifice) are prosperous. Therefore a hornless cow has pleasure during the\ntwo months of the rainy season, for that is won for it by the Sattra.\nTherefore whatever is done in the house of one who performs for a year (a\nSattra), that is done completely, successfully, and adequately. Those who\nperform the year (Sattra) are swimming on the ocean. He who does not see the\nfurther bank of the ocean cannot get out from it. The ocean is the year [2].\nIts further banks are the two Atiratras. Those who knowing thus perform the\nyear (Sattra) reach the end without injury. The former Atiratra is this\n(earth), the latter is yonder (sky); the former is mind, the latter speech;\nthe former expiration, the latter inspiration; the former the commencement,\nthe latter the end. The Atiratra is a Jyotistoma, of Vai\xc3\xa7vanara; verily they\nput light before them, to reveal the world of heaven. There is a fore\noffering, accompanied by the Caturvin\xc3\xa7a Stoma. The year has twenty-four half-\nmonths [3]; verily as they go on they find support in the year. There are\nthree hundred and sixty Stotriyas; so many are the nights of the year; verily\nthey attain both forms of the year.  \nThey perform (the rites of) the next days for rest, for safety. There are six-\nday periods. The year has six seasons; verily they find support in the\nseasons, the year. The Go and the Ayus (Stomas) are the Stomas in the middle;\nverily they place a pair in the middle of the year [4] for procreation. On\neither side there is the Jyotistoma. It is the releasing; verily the metres\nare released; verily also they go to the world of heaven with the six-day\n(rite) which has a Jyotistoma on either side. The theologians say, 'They sit;\nby what path do they go?' One should reply,' By the path that leads to the\ngods. The path that leads to the gods is the metres, the Gayatri, Tristubh,\nand Jagati. The Gayatri is the Jyotistoma, the Tristubh, the Gostoma, the\nJagati the Ayustoma. In that there are these Stomas, so do they go by the path\nthat leads to the gods [5]. There is used the same Saman. The Saman is the\nworld of the gods; verily they leave not the world of the gods. There are used\nvarious verses. The verses are the world of man; verily they keep mounting one\nworld of gods after another from the world of men. There is the Brahman's\nSaman as the Abhivarta to win the world of heaven. There is the Abhijit (day)\nfor the gaining of the world of heaven. There is the Vi\xc3\xa7vajit (day) for the\ngaining of all. Month by month they perform the Prsthas, month by month the\nAtigrahyas are drawn; verily in each month they place strength, for the\nsupport of the months. They perform the Prsthas in the latter part of the\nmonth. Therefore it is on the top that the plants bear fruit.\n\n### vii. 5. 2.\n\nThe cows performed that Sattra, being hornless and desiring to obtain horns.\nFor ten months they performed it, and then horns appeared. They said, 'We have\ngained (them), let us cease (the rite), for we have attained the desire for\nthe sake of which we began (the rite).' But others said, either half of them\nor as many as might be the case, 'Let us perform (the rite) for these months,\nthe eleventh and the twelfth, and when we have made up the year, let us cease'\n[1]. In their case their horns grew in the twelfth month. Whether by faith, or\nby lack of faith-that is, those which have no horns-both indeed were\nprosperous, those which gained horns and those which won strength. He who\nceases after ten months is prosperous, and he who ceases after twelve also, if\nhe knows thus. They go by their feet, and he who goes by his foot attains\n(what he seeks). The Ayana is successful, and therefore is it productive of\ncows.\n\n### vii. 5. 3.\n\nThey perform the Prahas in the first month, they perform them in the middle\nmonth, they perform them in the last month. They say, 'In the case of a cow\nwhich they milk thrice a day, she yields sparingly at the latter two milkings;\nhow then can she be milked who is twelve times milked?' Having made up the\nyear, they should perform the Prsthas once in the last month; verily the\nsacrificers win the sacrifice and cattle. It is an ocean [1] without a near or\na further shore that they enter upon who perform the year (rite). If they\nemploy the Brhat and the Rathantara Samans, it would be as if they were to\nprovide a boat in the middle of the ocean. Going continuously with the Brhat\nand the Rathantara they obtain support. The union is milked for all desires;\nthus the sacrificers obtain all desires.\n\n### vii. 5. 4.\n\nThe Rcs are the same. The Rcs are the world of men; verily they leave not the\nworld of man. There are different Samans; the Saman is the world of the gods;\nverily they descend from the world of the gods to one world after another of\nmen. They first use the Jagati, and the metres descend from the Jagati, the\ncups from the Agrayana, the Prsthas from the Brhat, the Stomas from the\nTrayastrin\xc3\xa7a. Therefore the younger descends before an elder. The Vi\xc3\xa7vakarman\ncup is drawn; verily by it the sacrificers win all rites. The cup for Aditi\n[1] is drawn. Aditi is this (earth); verily they rest on this (earth). The one\nand the other are drawn, for pairing, for propagation. Of old Prajapati\ncreated offspring by means of the ten-night (rite); in that the ten-night rite\nis performed, the sacrificers create offspring. Udanka \xc3\x87aulbayana has declared\nthe ten-night rite to be the prosperity of the Sattra, and the ten-night rite\nserves for the prosperity of the Sattra. Verily also whatever is done wrongly\nin the earlier days, this serves to atone for it.\n\n### vii. 5. 5.\n\nIf two libations are offered simultaneously, then one should perform the early\nlitany in the advanced part of the night. He who does it first wins the\nspeech, the gods, and the metres (of the others). The strophe should contain\nthe word 'strong ( _vrsan_ )'; verily he takes Indra away from their morning\npressing. Or rather they say, 'The strophe at the beginning of each pressing\nshould be of this kind'; verily he takes Indra away from each of their\npressings.  \nFor entry, for rest, for the overcoming, of the Gayatri, of the Tristubh, of\nthe Jagati, of the Anustubh, of the Pankti, hail!  \nEntry and rest are the metres; verily by the metres [1], he takes away their\nmetres. One should recite the Sajaniya hymn; one should recite the Vihavya\nhymn; one should recite the Kaya\xc3\xa7ubhiya hymn of Agastya. This indeed is so\nmuch as that, verily he takes away so much as is theirs. If at the early\npressing the bowl is broken, they should sing verses addressed to Visnu and\ncontaining the epithet \xc3\x87ipivista. Whatever in the sacrifice is redundant, is\nredundant with regard to Visnu \xc3\x87ipivista; verily Visnu \xc3\x87ipivista places the\nredundant in the redundant. Verily having obtained the redundant by the\nredundant, they win it. If it is broken at the midday pressing, they should\nmake the Saman have the Vasatkara as its finale. The support of the sacrifice\nis the Vasatkara; verily they make the Saman obtain support. If it breaks at\nthe third pressing, the same thing (should be done).\n\n**\n\nvii. 5. 6.\n\n**\n\nHaving made up the month with the six-day periods they leave out a day, for\nthey behold the months by the six-day periods. Having made up the months with\nthe half-months, they leave out a day, for they behold the months by the half-\nmonths. Having made up the months by the new moon night, they leave out a day,\nfor they behold the months by the new moon night. Having made up the months by\nthe full moon night, they leave out a day, for they behold the month by the\nfull moon night. He who pours (liquid) into a full (vessel) wastes the liquid;\nhe who pours out from a full (vessel) [1] places breath in it. In that, having\nmade up the months with the full moon night, they leave out a day, they place\nbreath in the year, and the performers of the Sattra breathe along it. If they\ndid not leave out a day, then the year would fall asunder, as falls asunder a\nskin bag tied tight, and they would be ruined. In that, having made up the\nmonths with the full moon night, they leave out a day, they place out-\nbreathing in the year, and the performers of the Sattra breathe out along it\n[2], and are not ruined. At the full moon (the Soma) of the gods is pressed.\nIn that, having made up the months with the full moon night, they leave out a\nday, with the sacrifice to the gods they go to another sacrifice. They cleave\nasunder the sacrifice, in that (after performing it) as a series of six-day\nrites they leave out a day. They offer an animal for Prajapati. Prajapati is\nall the gods; verily with the gods do they offer the sacrifice. They leave the\npressing [3], who leave out the day. The Samnayya is the fourth pressing.\nBecause there is the Samnayya, they do not leave the pressing. They partake of\nit after uttering the invocation, for they have this then as their Soma drink.\nThe deities who share in the pressings of those who leave out the day go to\ntheir places; they offer the sacrificial cakes in each of the pressings;\nverily they win the deities who share in the pressing from their several\nplaces. (They offer the cakes) on eight potsherds at the early pressing, on\neleven potsherds at the midday pressing, and on twelve potsherds at the third\npressing; verily they obtain and win the metres. They offer an oblation to the\nAll-gods at the third pressing. The third pressing belongs to the All-gods;\nverily they leave not the third pressing.\n\n### vii. 5. 7.\n\nThe theologians consider, 'Should (a day) be left out, or should it not be\nleft out?' They say, 'It should be left out.' They say, 'It should be left out\nat the new moon and at the full moon, for these two guide the sacrifice.'\n'These two must not be left out,' they say, 'for these two determine the\ndependent sacrifice.' '(The day) should be left out on the first Vyastaka,'\nthey say, 'for this is what rends the month.' They should not leave out a day\nwhich is appointed [1]. If they should leave out one which is appointed, they\nshould leave it out on the seventh day after making up the months with six-day\nperiods, whatever be the recur rent position which it occupies in the course\nof the six-day period. They should then offer to Agni, with the Vasus, a cake\non eight potsherds, to Indra curds, to Indra with the Maruts a cake on eleven\npotsherds, to the All-gods a cake on twelve potsherds. The early pressing\nbelongs to Agni with the Vasus; in that they offer to Agni with the Vasus a\ncake on eight potsherds, they make the god share in it [2], and they approach\nthe pressing with eight. In that the curds belong to Indra, they do not shut\nout Indra from a share. The midday pressing belongs to Indra with the Maruts.\nIn that they offer to Indra with the Maruts a cake on eleven potsherds, they\nmake the god share in it, and they approach the pressing with eleven [3]. The\nthird pressing belongs to the All-gods with the Rbhus. In that they offer to\nthe All-gods a cake on twelve pot sherds, they make the gods share in it, and\nthey approach the pressing with twelve. They offer a beast to Prajapati-\nPrajapati is the sacrifice that the sacrifice may not be abandoned. For six\nmonths (as they go) hence the Brahman's Saman should be the 'victorious'. The\n'victorious' is the holy power (Brahman); verily they go winning the world of\nheaven by the holy power (Brahman); for the world of heaven is as it were\nopposite from hence. When they come thence the Brahman's Saman for six months\nshould be 'O Indra, bear us strength, as a father to his sons. Guide us, O\nthou that art much invoked, on our path. Living, may we attain the light.' The\nlight is this world, the light is offspring; verily they come, gazing on this\nworld by repeating the verse.\n\n### vii. 5. 8.\n\nWhen the gods had come to the end, their power and strength departed. They won\nthem again by the Kro\xc3\xa7a (Saman), and that is why the Kro\xc3\xa7a has the name. In\nthat they sing the Kro\xc3\xa7a at the end of the pit, they win power and strength at\nthe end of the sacrifice. They sing the Sattra syarddhi (Saman) at the end of\nthe Ahavaniya; verily, making Agni a witness, they advance to prosperity. They\nsing the Prajapater Hrdaya within the shed; verily they win his favour. They\nsing the \xc3\x87loka (Saman) in front of the Sadas [1], the Anu\xc3\xa7loka (Saman) behind;\nverily fame is their portion at the end of the sacrifice. The Adhvaryu sings\nnine (verses). Nine are the breaths in man; verily he places breaths in the\nsacrificers. All of them are addressed to Indra; verily he places power\n(indriya) in the breaths. He sings without the Pratihara. Therefore a man can\ncontract all the other members (of the body) except the head, but the bead\nnot. The Rathantara (Saman) has the Pa\xc3\xb1cada\xc3\xa7a (Stoma); verily they win power.\nThe Brhat has the Saptada\xc3\xa7a [2], for the winning of food; verily also they are\npropagated by it. The Bhadra (Saman) has the Ekavin\xc3\xa7a (Stoma) with Dvipada\nverses, for support. The wives (of the sacrificers) sing, for offspring, for\npropagation. Prajapati created offspring; he desired, 'May I gain the kingship\nover them.' He obtained the kingship over them by the Rajana (Saman), and that\nis why the Rajana has the name. In that there is the Rajana, the sacrificers\nobtain the kingship over offspring. It has the Pa\xc3\xb1cavin\xc3\xa7a (Stoma), to win\nPrajapati [3]. They sing five (verses) standing; verily they win the world of\nthe gods; five sitting; verily they win the world of men. These come to ten;\nthe Viraj is of ten syllables, the Viraj is food; verily they win food by the\nViraj. In five places they sing sitting down; there are five quarters; verily\nthey rest on the quarters. They come up each before one verse has been sung;\nverily they bear food from the quarters. The Udgatr sings these (verses);\nverily having borne food from the quarters [4] they place glory in themselves.\nTherefore one breath protects all the limbs. Therefore, just as a bird about\nto fly upwards raises its head aloft, so the sacrificers are highest among\npeople. The Udgatr mounts a throne; verily they attain rule. The Hotr (mounts)\na swing; verily they mount the back of the firmament. The Adhvaryu (mounts)\ntwo mats; verily they reach the surface of the ruddy one. So many indeed are\nthe worlds, and in them in order they find support. Then the sacrificers make\nthus a bridge to mount, for the gaining of the world of heaven.\n\n### vii. 5. 9.\n\nBy means of the Arkya (Saman) Prajapati created offspring in thousands. From\nthem by means of the Ilamda (Saman) he took away the food they had gathered.\nIn that there is the Arkya, the sacrificers create offspring; in that there is\nthe Ilamda, they take away from the offspring which has been created the food\nthey have gathered. Therefore, in whatever year the Sattra is performed, the\noffspring are hungry in that year, for they take their food and strength; in\nwhatever year the Sattra is imperfect, the offspring are not hungry in that\nyear [1]; for they take not their food and strength. They raise a loud noise.\nAs men being freed from bonds cry aloud, so the sacrificers freed from the\nbonds of the gods cry aloud, placing food and strength in themselves. The lute\nhas a hundred strings. Man is of a hundred (years) of age, and of a\nhundredfold strength; verily they find support in age and strength. They run a\nrace, to win what has not yet been won. They beat drums; the voice of the drum\nis the highest (form of) speech; verily they win the highest (form of) speech.\nThey beat the earth-drum; verily they win that speech which has entered this\n(earth); verily also they conquer the earth. All (forms of) speech they utter,\nto gain all (forms of speech). Two strive on a dry hide, to gain strength. One\nreviles, another extols. He who reviles purifies them, he who extols places\nfood in them after they are purified. They win by the first months what is\ndone by the Rsis and by the gods; in that the Bhutechad Samans are used, both\nare gained. Those who perform the year rite lose their virility. There are a\npair united within the sacrificial ground; verily they lose not virility.\n\n### vii. 5. 10.\n\nThey pierce the hide; verily they remove the sin of the (sacrificers). 'Do not\nmiss, do not pierce through', he says; verily they now remove their sin. Slave\ngirls dance round the Marjaliya fire with water-pots on their heads, beating\nthe ground with their feet, and singing 'This is honey.' Honey indeed is the\nchiefest food of the gods; verily they win the chiefest food. They beat the\nground with their feet; verily they endow the (sacrificers) with might.\n\n_\n\nThe Horse Sacrifice (continued)\n\n_\n\n### vii. 5. 11.\n\nTo earth hail!  \nTo the atmosphere hail!  \nTo the sky hail!  \nTo that which will stream together hail!  \nTo that which is streaming together hail!  \nTo that which hath streamed together hail!  \nTo that which will cloud hail!  \nTo that which cloudeth hail!  \nTo that which hath been clouded hail!  \nTo cloud hail!  \nTo mist hail!  \nTo storm hail!  \nTo freezing hail!  \nTo springing hail!  \nTo that which will lighten hail!  \nTo that which lighteneth hail!  \nTo that which lighteneth together hail!  \nTo that which will thunder hail!  \nTo that which thundereth hail!  \nTo that which thundereth terribly hail!  \nTo that which will rain hail!  \nTo that which raineth hail!  \nTo that which raineth around hail!  \nTo that which raineth about hail!  \nTo that which raineth together hail!

Again the fire which is\npiled up is cruel, and if one were not to cast upon the fire which has been\npiled up these oblations, the cruel fire would spring up in wrath, and injure\nthe offspring and cattle of the sacrificer. In that he casts the oblations on\nthe fire which has been piled up, he appeases it with its own portion, and the\ncruel fire [1] does not spring up in wrath and injure his offspring and\ncattle. There are ten oblations. Nine are the breaths in man, and the navel is\nthe tenth; verily he places breaths in the sacrificer. Again the Viraj is of\nten syllables; the Viraj is food; verily he finds support in the Viraj as\nfood. 'It must be piled with the seasons, the metres, the Stomas, and the\nPrsthas', they say. In that he casts these oblations, he piles it with the\nseasons, the metres, the Stomas, and the Prsthas. 'The quarters can be won by\none who has pressed the Soma' they say [2]. In that he casts these oblations,\n(it is) for the winning of the quarters. The gods made Indra sacrifice with\nit, and therefore is it Indra's pressing; men made Manu sacrifice with it, and\ntherefore is it Manu's pressing. As Indra among the gods, as Manu among men,\nbecomes he who knowing thus sacrifices with this sacrifice.
