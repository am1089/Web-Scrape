The rule for (times of) distress (is) that a Brahma _n_ a may study under\na teacher who is not a Brahma _n_ a. 1\n\n2\\. (A student is bound) to walk behind and to obey (his non-Brahmanical\nteacher). 2\n\n3\\. (But), when (the course of study) has been finished, the Brahma _n_ a\n(pupil is more) venerable (than his teacher). 3\n\n4\\. (In times of distress it is permissible) to offer 4\n\np. 212\n\nsacrifices for (men of) all (castes), to teach (them), and to accept (presents\nfrom them).\n\n5\\. Each preceding (mode of living is) preferable (to those named later). 5\n\n6\\. On failure of the (occupations lawful for a Brahma _n_ a) he may live by\nthe occupations of a Kshatriya. 6\n\n7\\. On failure of those, he may live by the occupations of a Vai _s_ ya. 7\n\n8\\. (Goods) that may not be sold by a (Brahma _n_ a are),\n\n9\\. Perfumes, substances (used for) flavouring (food), prepared food, sesamum,\nhempen and linen cloth, skins, 9\n\n10\\. Garments dyed red or washed, 10\n\n11\\. Milk and preparations from it, 11\n\n12\\. Roots, fruits, flowers, medicines, honey, flesh, grass, water, poison,\n\np. 213\n\n13\\. Nor animals for slaughter,\n\n14\\. Nor, under any circumstances, human beings, heifers, female calves, cows\nbig with young. 14\n\n15\\. Some (declare, that the traffic in) land, rice, barley, goats, sheep,\nhorses, bulls, milch-cows, and draught-oxen (is) likewise (forbidden). 15\n\n16\\. But (it is permissible) to barter, 16\n\n17\\. One kind of substances used for flavouring others,\n\n18\\. And animals (for animals).\n\n19\\. Salt and prepared food (must) not (be bartered), 19\n\n20\\. Nor sesamum.\n\n21\\. But for present use an equal (quantity of) uncooked (food may be\nexchanged) for cooked (food).\n\n22\\. But if no (other course is) possible (a Brahma _n_ a) may support himself\nin any way except by (following the occupations) of a _S_ udra. 22\n\n23\\. Some (permit) even this in case his life is in danger.\n\n24\\. But to mix with that (caste) and forbidden food must be avoided (even in\ntimes of distress). 24\n\np. 214\n\n25\\. If his life is threatened, even a Brahma _n_ a may use arms. 25\n\n26\\. (In times of distress) a Kshatriya (may follow) the occupations of a Vai\n_s_ ya. 26\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[211:1](sbe0271.htm#fr_997) **VII**. \xc3\x82pastamba II, 2, 4, 25.\n\n[211:2](sbe0271.htm#fr_998) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 2, 4. 26.\n\n[211:3](sbe0271.htm#fr_999) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 2, 4, 27.\n\n[211:4](sbe0271.htm#fr_1000) Haradatta quotes Manu X, 103 in support of the\nabove explanation, and adds that another commentator interprets the p. 212\nSutra to mean, that in times of distress men of all castes may support\nthemselves by sacrificing for others, teaching, and the acceptance of gifts,\nthough in ordinary times these modes of living are reserved for Brahma _n_ as.\n\n[212:5](sbe0271.htm#fr_1001) The use of the masculine in the text, \'purva _h_\npurvo guru _h_ ,\' may, I think, be explained by the fact that the compound in\nthe preceding Sutra ends with a noun of the masculine gender.\n\n[212:6](sbe0271.htm#fr_1002) Manu X, 81; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. III, 35.\n\n[212:7](sbe0271.htm#fr_1003) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 7, 20, 11.\n\n[212:9](sbe0271.htm#fr_1004) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 7, 20, 12-13. \'Substances used for\nflavouring (rasa), i.e. oil, sugar, clarified butter, salt, and the like.\'--\nHaradatta. From Sutra 19 it is clear that \'rasa\' does not simply mean\n\'liquids.\'\n\n[212:10](sbe0271.htm#fr_1005) My MSS. read nir _n_ ikte for nikte, and nir _n_\niktam is explained by \'washed by a washerman or the like person.\' It is\npossible to translate Professor Stenzler\'s reading in accordance with Manu X,\n87, \'pairs of (i.e. upper and lower) garments dyed red.\'\n\n[212:11](sbe0271.htm#fr_1006) \'Preparations from it, i.e. sour milk and the\nlike.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[213:14](sbe0271.htm#fr_1007) Under any circumstances (nityam, literally\n"always") means even when they are not sold for slaughter. Another\n(commentator) says, that, as the expression "under any circumstances" is used\nhere, the prohibition regarding the above-mentioned things, i.e. sesamum and\nthe like, does not hold good under all circumstances, and that hence self-\ngrown sesamum and other grain may be sold, see Manu X, 90.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[213:15](sbe0271.htm#fr_1008) Manu X, 88. Haradatta explains \'land\' by\n\'houses.\'\n\n[213:16](sbe0271.htm#fr_1009)-21. \xc3\x82pastamba I, 7, 20, 14-15.\n\n[213:19](sbe0271.htm#fr_1010) \'The sale of salt and prepared food has been\nforbidden by Sutra 9, but their barter has been permitted (by Sutra 17).\'--\nHaradatta.\n\n[213:22](sbe0271.htm#fr_1011) Regarding the _S_ udra\'s occupations, see below,\nX 57-60.\n\n[213:24](sbe0271.htm#fr_1012) \'Restriction (niyama), i.e. avoiding. That\nBrahma _n_ a p. 214 even who lives the life of a _S_ udra must not mix with\nthat _S_ udra caste, i.e. he must not sit among _S_ udras and so forth.\'--\nHaradatta.\n\n[214:25](sbe0271.htm#fr_1013) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 10, 29, 7; Manu VIII, 348.\n\n[214:26](sbe0271.htm#fr_1014) Haradatta adds, that in accordance with the\nprinciple exemplified by the rule of this Sutra a Vai _s_ ya may follow in\ntimes of distress the occupations of a _S_ udra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VIII](sbe0272.htm)\n\n'
