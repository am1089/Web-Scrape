But as in the case of light and so on. Not so is the highest.\n\nThe 'but' discards the objection. 'Like light and so on.' The individual soul\nis a part of the highest Self; as the light issuing from a luminous thing such\nas fire or the sun is a part of that body; or as the generic characteristics\nof a cow or horse, and the white or black colour of things so coloured, are\nattributes and hence parts of the things in which those attributes inhere; or\nas the body is a part of an embodied being. For by a part we understand that\nwhich constitutes one place (de _s_ a) of some thing, and hence a\ndistinguishing attribute (vi _s_ esh _n_ a) is a part of the thing\ndistinguished by that attribute. Hence those analysing a thing of that kind\ndiscriminate between the _distinguishing_ clement or part of it, and the\n_distinguished_ element or part. Now although the distinguishing attribute and\nthe thing distinguished thereby stand to each other in the relation of part\nand whole, yet we observe them to differ in essential character. Hence there\nis no contradiction between the individual and the highest Self--the former of\nwhich is a vi _s_ esha _n_ a of the latter--standing to each other in the\nrelation of part and whole, and their being at the same time of essentially\ndifferent nature. This the Sutra declares 'not so is the highest,' i.e. the\nhighest Self is not of the same nature as the individual soul. For as the\nluminous body is of a nature different from that of its light, thus the\nhighest Self differs from the individual soul which is a part of it. It is\nthis difference of character--due to the individual soul being the\ndistinguishing clement and the highest Self being the substance distinguished\nthereby--to which all those texts refer which declare difference. Those texts,\non the other hand, which declare non-difference are\n\np. 564\n\nbased on the circumstance that attributes which are incapable of separate\nexistence are ultimately bound to the substance which they distinguish, and\nhence are fundamentally valid. That in declarations such as 'Thou art that'\nand 'this Self is Brahman,' the words _thou_ and _Self_ , no less than the\nwords _that_ and _Brahman_ , denote Brahman in so far as having the individual\nsouls for its body, and that thus the two sets of words denote fundamentally\none and the same thing, has been explained previously.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 46.
