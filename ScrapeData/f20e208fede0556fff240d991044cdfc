Now, on the third, or the sixth, or the twelfth day 2, having\ncombined (the two performances of) the Pravargya and Upasads 3, he \'sets out\n4\' the Pravargya, for set out (removed), as it were, is this head (from the\ntrunk). Having gathered together all around it 5 (the Mahavira pot), they\n\np. 494\n\nmeet together upon the Vedi in the _S_ ala, (entering) by the front door.\n\n14:3:1:22\\. The \xc3\x82gnidhra then brings three bundles of faggots to the\n\xc3\x82havaniya, and kindling one of them, he offers (thereon) whilst holding it 1\non a level with (the Sacrificer\'s) mouth. When the sacrifice had its head cut\noff its heat went out of it, and entered these worlds: it is with that heat he\nthus supplies and completes it.\n\n14:3:1:33\\. And as to why (it is held) on a level with the mouth,--well, what\nis level with the mouth is, as it were, above; and above, as it were, is\nyonder (heavenly) world: thus he thereby supplies and completes it (the\nPravargya) with that heat which had entered yonder world.\n\n14:3:1:44\\. [He offers, with Va _g_. S. XXXVIII, 18,] \'What heavenly fire of\nthine there is, O Gharma,\'--just the fire which is heavenly;--\'what is in the\nGayatri and in the Havirdhana,\'--\n\np. 495\n\njust that which is in the Gayatri (metre) and Havirdhana (shed);--\'may that\n(fire) of thine increase and become firm: to that (fire) of thine, hail!\' in\nthis there is nothing hidden, so to speak.\n\n14:3:1:55\\. Then, having kindled the second (bundle), he offers (thereon)\nwhilst holding it navel-high; for in the middle, as it were, is what is navel-\nhigh, and in the middle, as it were, is the air-world: thus he thereby\nsupplies and completes it with that heat which had entered the air-world.\n\n14:3:1:66\\. \'What fire of thine is in the air,\'--just the fire which is in the\nair;--\'what is in the Trish _t_ ubh and in the \xc3\x82gnidhra,\' just that which is\nin the Trish _t_ ubh (metre) and \xc3\x82gnidhra (fire-shed);--\'may that (fire) of\nthine increase and become firm: to that (fire) of thine, hail!\' in this there\nis nothing hidden, so to speak.\n\n14:3:1:77\\. Then, having put the third (bundle) on the fire, he offers on it\nwhilst sitting; for below, as it were, is he who is sitting; and below, as it\nwere, is this (terrestrial) world: thus the thereby supplies and completes it\nwith that heat which had entered this (terrestrial) world.\n\n14:3:1:88\\. \'What fire of thine is in the earth,\'--just that fire which is in\nthe earth;--\'what is in the _G_ agati and in the Sadas,\' just that which is in\nthe _G_ agati (metre) and the Sadas (shed);--\'may that (fire) of thine\nincrease and become firm: to that (fire) of thine, hail!\' in this there is\nnothing hidden, so to speak.\n\n14:3:1:99\\. He (the Adhvaryu) then steps out 1, with\n\np. 496\n\n[paragraph continues] (Va _g_. S. XXXVIII, 19), \'Thee (we will follow) for the\nprotection of the Kshatra,\'--for he who shines yonder 1 is indeed the divine\nruler: \'for the protection of this human ruler,\' he thereby means to\nsay;--\'guard thou the Brahman\'s body!\'--that is to say, \'preserve thou the\nBrahman\'s person (atman);\'--\'Thee (we will follow) as a stay for the Vi _s_ ,\'\n--the Vi _s_ (people, clan) doubtless is the sacrifice: \'for the safety of the\nsacrifice,\' he thus means to say;--\'we will follow to new prosperity,\'--it is\nfor the safety and the stability of the sacrifice that the says this.\n\n14:3:1:1010\\. He then says (to the Prastot _ri_ ), \'Sing the Saman!\' or\n\'Recite the Saman!\' but let him rather say, \'Sing the Saman!\' for they indeed\nsing the Saman. When he sings the Saman it is in order that the fiends, the\nRakshas, should not injure these\n\np. 497\n\noutside the sacrifice, the body; for the Saman is a repeller of the fiends,\nthe Rakshas.\n\n14:3:1:1111\\. He sings it on a (verse) relating to Agni, for Agni is the\nrepeller of the Rakshas. On an Ati _k_ _kh_ andas (verse) he sings it, for\nthat--to wit, the Ati _k_ _kh_ andas (redundant metre) is all metres,\ntherefore he sings it on an Ati _k_ _kh_ andas (verse).\n\n14:3:1:1212\\. He sings 1, \'Agni burneth, encountereth with flames, Ahavo!\nAhavo 1!\'--it is thus he repels the fiends, the Rakshas, from here.\n\n14:3:1:1313\\. They walk out (from the sacrificial ground) northwards 2, along\nthe back of the pit and the front side of the \xc3\x82gnidhra (fire-house)--for this\nis the gate of the sacrifice--and proceed in whatever direction from there\nwater is (to be found).\n\n14:3:1:1414\\. Let him \'set out\' that (Pravargya) on an island; for, when\nheated, it becomes burning-hot 3; and were he to set it out on this (earth),\nits heat would enter this (earth); and were he to set it out on water, its\nheat would enter the water; but when he sets it out on an island--thus,\nindeed, it does not injure either the water or this (earth), for inasmuch as\nhe does not throw it into the water, it does not injure the water; and\ninasmuch as the water flows all round it--water being a means\n\np. 498\n\nof soothing--it does not injure this (earth): let him therefore set it out on\nan island.\n\n14:3:1:1515\\. But let him rather set it out on the Uttaravedi 1; for the\nUttara-vedi is the sacrifice, and the Pravargya is its head: he thus restores\nto the sacrifice its head.\n\n14:3:1:1616\\. The first Pravargya (pot) he sets out so as to be close to (the\nfront side of) the navel (of the Uttara-vedi), for the northern (upper) navel\nis the voice, and the Pravargya is the head: he thus places the voice in the\nhead.\n\n14:3:1:1717\\. [He does so, with Va _g_. S. XXXVIII, 20,] \'The four-cornered,\'\n--four-cornered, indeed, is he who shines yonder, for the quarters are his\ncorners: therefore he says, \'Four-cornered\';--\n\n14:3:1:1818. \\--\'Mighty navel of the divine order,\'--the divine order being\nthe truth, he thereby means to say, \'The mighty navel of the truth;\'--\'that\nmighty one (be) unto us of all life;\'--\'that mighty one (be) unto us (a\nbestower) of the complete (term of) life,\' he thereby means to say 2;\n\np. 499\n\n14:3:1:1919\\. --\'from the hatred, from the guile,\'--in this there is nothing\nhidden, so to speak;--\'of him of another law, let us free ourselves!\'--another\nlaw, indeed, is his (Pravargya\'s and the Sun\'s), and another that of men 1:\ntherefore he says, \'Of him of another law, let us free ourselves.\' In this way\nthe other two (pots are placed) east of it: this is threefold, for the head is\nthreefold 2.\n\n14:3:1:2020\\. In front thereof (he places) the reserve (lump of) clay, whereby\nhe puts flesh upon it (Pravargya); on the two sides thereof the two lifting-\nsticks, whereby he gives two arms to it; and on the two sides yet further away\nthe two Rauhi _n_ a offering-ladles, whereby he gives two hands to it.\n\n14:3:1:2121\\. On the left (north) side (he places) the spade, for there is its\nplace of rest; on the right (right) side the imperial throne, for there is its\nplace of rest; on the left side the black antelope-skin, for there is its\nplace of rest; on all sides (save the front side) the fans, for, the fans\nbeing the vital airs, he thereby bestows vital airs on it; there are three of\nthem, for there are three vital airs, the out- (and in-) breathing, the up-\nbreathing, and the through-breathing: it is these he thus bestows on him.\n\n14:3:1:2222\\. He then puts the cords and halter on the supporting-tray, and\nplaces (the latter) behind (the\n\np. 500\n\nnavel) with its point towards the east: a belly he thus gives to it. On the\ntwo sides thereof the two milking-bowls (pinvana): two testicles he thereby\ngives to it, for by means of his testicles the male overflows (pinv). Behind\n(them he places) the post and peg: whereby he gives two thighs to it; behind\n(them) the two Rauhi _n_ a-plates, whereby he gives two knees to it; and as to\ntheir being single plates, it is because these knees consist, as it were, of\nsingle plates (bones). Behind (them) the two poking-sticks (dh _ri_ sh _t_ i),\nwhereby he gives two feet to it, for with the feet one strikes out boldly (dh\n_ri_ sh _t_ am). On the left side the two mounds 1 used in the performance,.\nfor there is their place of rest; on the right side the Mar _g_ aliya 2, for\nthere is its place of rest.\n\n14:3:1:2323\\. He then pours milk into that (chief pot), with (Va _g_. S.\nXXXVIII, 21), \'This, O Gharma, is the contents of thy bowels,\'--the contents\nof the bowels being food, it is food he thus puts into it;--\'Grow thou, and\nfill out thereby!\'--in this there is nothing hidden, so to speak;--\'and may we\nourselves grow, and fill out!\'--it is a blessing he thereby invokes.\n\n14:3:1:2424\\. Let him not pour in all (the milk), lest the food should turn\naway from the Sacrificer.--He leaves over half of it or more; and on that same\nafternoon he pours it to the fast-milk, and hands it to the Sacrificer:\nthereby he bestows food upon\n\np. 501\n\nthe Sacrificer, and thus, indeed, food does not turn away from the Sacrificer,\n\n14:3:1:2525\\. He then sprinkles it (the Pravargya apparatus) with water: water\nbeing a means of appeasement, he thus appeases it; he sprinkles it all over:\nall over he thus appeases it; three times he sprinkles, for threefold is the\nsacrifice.\n\n14:3:1:2626\\. He then says (to the Prastot _ri_ ), \'Sing the Varshahara\nSaman!\'--the fallow stallion 1 (v _ri_ sha hari _h_ ) doubtless is he who\nshines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that (sun): it is thus him he thereby\npleases, and therefore he says, \'Sing the Varshahara Saman 2!\'\n\n14:3:1:2727\\. They then cleanse themselves at the pit. With (Va _g_. S.\nXXXVIII, 23), \'May the waters and plants be friendly unto us,\' he takes water\nin his joined hands; for water is a thunderbolt: he thus makes a covenant with\nthe thunderbolt;--and with, \'May they be unfriendly unto him who hateth us,\nand whom we hate!\' let him sprinkle it in whatever direction he who is hateful\nto him may be, and he thereby overthrows him.\n\n14:3:1:2828\\. He (the Sacrificer) then steps out towards the north-east, with\n(Va _g_. S. XXXVIII, 24), \'From out of the gloom have we risen,\'--gloom is\n\np. 502\n\nevil: it is gloom, evil, he thus drives away;--\'beholding the higher light,\'--\nthis (terrestrial) world is higher than the water: it is on this world he thus\nestablishes himself;--\'God Surya, with the gods, the highest light,\'--Surya,\nthe highest light, is the heavenly world: it is in the heavenly world he thus\nfinally establishes himself. He walks along without looking back, and puts a\nlog of wood on the \xc3\x82havaniya 1, with (Va _g_. S. XXXVIII, 25), \'A kindler thou\nart, fire thou art: lay thou fire into me!\' it is a blessing he thereby\ninvokes.\n\n14:3:1:2929\\. And at a continued pressing of Soma they also perform the Gharma\nof curds and whey (Dadhi-gharma),--for Soma is the sacrifice, and the\nPravargya is its head: he thus restores to the sacrifice its head,--at the\nmidday-pressing, for that--to wit, the midday-pressing--is Indra\'s special\npressing: he thus pleases him in his own share;--when the Madhyandina-pavamana\nhas been chanted, for the Madhyandina-pavamana is the breath: it is breath he\nthereby lays into him;--with the Agnihotra-ladle, for the Agnihotra is the\nmouth of sacrifices: he thus puts a mouth in the head.\n\n14:3:1:3030\\. On its being brought, he says, \'Hotar, speak what thou hast to\nspeak!\' for the Hot _ri_ speaks on this occasion. Then, stepping up, he says,\n\'Cooked is the offering-food;\' for cooked, indeed, it is. Having stepped\nacross (behind the \xc3\x82havaniya), and called for the _S_ rausha _t_ , he says,\n\'Pronounce the offering-formula!\' and offers on the Vasha _t_ being uttered.\nWhen the Vasha _t_ is\n\np. 503\n\nrepeated, he brings the draught, and hands it to the Sacrificer.\n\n14:3:1:3131\\. Having solicited an invitation 1 (and received an answer from\nthe priests), he drinks of it, with (Va _g_. S. XXXVIII, 27), \'May there be in\nme that great energy,\'--a great energy, indeed, is he who shines yonder;--\'in\nme the fitness, in me the intelligence,\'--fitness and intelligence he thus\nsecures to himself;--\'the Gharma of triple fires shineth,\'--for this Gharma of\ntriple fires indeed shines;--\'together with the shining light,\'--for together\nwith the shining light (the sun) it indeed is;--\'together with the fire, the\nBrahman,\'--for together with the fire, the Brahman, it indeed is,--(Va _g_. S.\nXXXVIII, 28), \'The seed of the milk hath been brought,\'--for this is indeed\nthe seed of the milk that has been brought;--\'may we obtain the milking\nthereof year after year!\'--it is a blessing he thereby invokes. They then\ncleanse themselves at the pit the significance of this is the same as before.\n\n14:3:1:3232\\. Now, then, as to the sacrificial gifts. The gold plate he gives\nto the Brahman; for the Brahman is seated, and gold is settled 2 glory:\ntherefore he gives the gold plate to the Brahman.\n\n14:3:1:3333\\. And that cow which yielded the Gharma-milk he gives to the\nAdhvaryu; for scorched, as it were, is the Gharma, and the Adhvaryu comes\nforth (from the sacrificial ground) like something scorched 3: therefore he\ngives it to the Adhvaryu.\n\n14:3:1:3434\\. And that cow which yielded the Sacrificer\'s\n\np. 504\n\nfast-milk he gives to the Hot _ri_ ; for the Hot _ri_ is the sacrifice, and\nthe Sacrificer also is the sacrifice: therefore he gives it to the Hot _ri_.\n\n14:3:1:3535\\. And that cow which yielded the fast-milk for the (Sacrificer\'s)\nwife he gives to the chanters, for it is they, the Udgat _ri_ s, that do, as\nit were, the wife\'s work on this occasion: therefore he gives it to the\nchanters.\n\n14:3:1:3636\\. And, verily, whosoever either teaches, or partakes of, this\n(Pravargya) enters that life, and that light: the observance thereof is the\nsame as at the creation 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[493:2](sbe44123.htm#fr_1301) That is, according to whether there are three,\nsix, or twelve Upasad days to the particular form of Soma-sacrifice about to\nbe performed. On each of these days there would be two performances of the\nUpasads,--and in case the Pravargya is to be performed--as many performances\nof that sacrifice.\n\n[493:3](sbe44123.htm#fr_1302) On the day before the Soma-sacrifice, the two\nperformances of the Pravargya and the Upasads are combined and gone through in\nthe forenoon, instead of the forenoon and afternoon as is otherwise the case.\nKaty. XXVI, 7, 1 does not refer to the performance of the Pravargya on this\nday, but merely remarks that \'at the end of the Upasads (i.e. of the\ncombination of the Upasads, comm.) the removal of the Pravargya\' takes place.\n\xc3\x82past. XV, 12, 4-6, on the other hand, states distinctly that the total number\nof performances of the Pravargya is to be double that of the Upasad days.\n\n[493:4](sbe44123.htm#fr_1303) The \'setting out\' (utsadana) of the Pravargya is\nthe technical phrase for the removal and orderly laying out (in the form of a\nman) of the apparatus used for the Pravargya ceremony.\n\n[493:5](sbe44123.htm#fr_1304) After collecting the implements they take them\nout of the _s_ ala p. 494 and lay them down near the Anta _h_ patya peg, at a\nfew steps from the front door (whilst \xc3\x82past. makes them to be put on the\nthrone-seat placed north of the \xc3\x82havaniya).\n\n[494:1](sbe44123.htm#fr_1305) According to the comm. on Katy. XXVI, 7, 4, it\nis the Adhvaryu who--after ladling four times into the offering-spoon--\ndistributes this ghee successively over the three bundles of sticks,--viz.\npouring some upon the first two whilst they are held, at the specified height\nover the \xc3\x82havaniya fire, by the Agnidh (who immediately after the offering\nthrows them into the fire), and upon the third after it has been held knee-\nhigh by the Agnidh, and then thrown into the fire by the Adhvaryu. According\nto \xc3\x82pastamba, who makes the Pratiprasthat _ri_ and Adhvaryu the two\nperformers, the third portion of the ghee is offered on the bundle of sticks\nwhilst it is still held knee-high over the fire. As noted by Katyayana, the\nceremony is analogous (though reversed as regards the order of height) to the\noffering on the three enclosing-stones at the _S_ atarudriya ceremony, IX, 1,\n1, 5 seqq.\n\n[495:1](sbe44123.htm#fr_1306) Viz. out of the _s_ ala, with the Sacrificer\'s\nwife in front of him, p. 496 and followed by the others. According to \xc3\x82past.\nXV, 13, 4, the Pratiprasthat _ri_ now leads the Sacrificer\'s wife within the\nenclosure; and whilst attendants carry away the objects not immediately\nconnected with the Pravargya ceremony (post, peg, strings, sand, &c.), the\nAdhvaryu places the throne-seat (with the chief vessels) so as to stand with\ntwo feet on the Vedi, and with the other two outside it, and calls on the\nPrastot _ri_ to sing the Saman. This (as is usual in chanting) is done three\ntimes--the Adhvaryu, however, repeating his summons each time--and each time\nall of them (including the Patni) sing or utter a special finale,--the first\ntime in the _s_ ala, the second time midway between the _s_ ala and the\nUttaravedi, and the third time when they have arrived behind the Uttaravedi;\nthe finales corresponding to the formulas of this paragraph, viz.--\'For the\nprotection (or protector) of heaven (we follow) thee!\'--\'For the protection of\nthe Brahman--thee!\'--\'For the protection of the self--thee!\'\n\n[496:1](sbe44123.htm#fr_1307) It should be borne in mind that the Mahavira by\nwhich they are supposing themselves to be led now, is looked upon as a symbol\nof the sun.\n\n[497:1](sbe44123.htm#fr_1309) The same Saman is sung when they betake\nthemselves to the expiatory bath at the end of the Soma-sacrifice, cf. IV, 4,\n5, 8 where the stobha had better be altered to \'ahavo\' (though the Sandhi in\nthe text is the same as of \'ahavas\'). As on that former occasion, all the\npriests, as well as the Sacrificer, join in the finale.\n\n[497:2](sbe44123.htm#fr_1310) In doing so, they take the Pravargya-vessels and\nimplements along with them.\n\n[497:3](sbe44123.htm#fr_1311) Hardly \'is suffering pain,\' as it was taken at\nIX, 2, 1, 29; though \' _s_ u _s_ u _k_ ana\' and \' _s_ u _k_ \' evidently refer\nto internal heat, or passion, cf. [p. 464](sbe44119.htm#page_464), note 4\n(There is no such note--JBH), [p. 468](sbe44119.htm#page_468), note\n[1](sbe44119.htm#fn_1241).\n\n[498:1](sbe44123.htm#fr_1312) Katyayana only lays down the rule that, in the\ncase of the sacrifice not being accompanied with the building of a fire-altar,\nthe Pravargya apparatus should be removed to the Uttara-vedi; whilst, in the\ncase of one who likewise performs the Agni _k_ ayana, he would doubtless\nfollow the indication already laid down in the Brahma _n_ a, IX, 2, 1, 19;\nviz. that the pot may be removed to an island, but should rather be deposited\non the fire-altar (in which case, however, the \'setting out\' of the apparatus\nwould apparently have to be deferred till after the performance of the Soma-\nsacrifice). \xc3\x82pastamba treats of the Uttara-vedi as the place where the\nimplements are to be deposited, but finally he allows an option of other\nplaces, including an island, but not the fire-altar.\n\n[498:2](sbe44123.htm#fr_1313) The words \'sa na _h_ sarvayu _h_ sapratha _h_ ,\'\nbeing here used as explanatory of \'sa no vi _s_ vayu _h_ sapratha _h_ ,\' have\nprobably got by mistake into the Sa _m_ hita.\n\n[499:1](sbe44123.htm#fr_1314) The author evidently understands the text more\nin accordance with Mahidhara\'s interpretation which makes \'anyavratasya\' to\nrefer to the Supreme Spirit (paramatma) whose law, or ways, are different\nfront men\'s, and construes it with \'sa _s_ _k_ ima\' (we serve, are devoted, to\nthat righteous one). The preceding part of the half-verse he would thus take\nindependently of this:--\'Away hatred! away guile!\'\n\n[499:2](sbe44123.htm#fr_1315) Viz. consisting of bone, skin, and hair.\n\n[500:1](sbe44123.htm#fr_1316) That is, the sand used for them, and brought\nthither in vessels.\n\n[500:2](sbe44123.htm#fr_1317) That is, the sand of the \'mound of remains\' (u\n_k_ _kh_ ish _t_ akhara), see [p. 489](sbe44122.htm#page_489), note\n[3](sbe44122.htm#fn_1283).\n\n[501:1](sbe44123.htm#fr_1318) Or, bull.--The Va _g_. S. (XXXVIII, 22) here\ninserts the verse Rig-v. IX, 2, 6, to be used during the sprinkling,--\'The\nfallow stallion hath whinnied--or, the fallow bull hath roared--the mighty\none, beautiful as Mitra, _the water-holding vessel_ hath shone like unto the\nsun." The italicised words, evidently added to suit the Mahavira vessel, are\nwanting in the _Ri_ k.\n\n[501:2](sbe44123.htm#fr_1319) Katy. XXVI, 7, 36 (doubtless in accordance with\nanother _s_ akha) also prescribes here the Ish _t_ ahotriya Saman.\n\n[502:1](sbe44123.htm#fr_1320) The Sacrificer\'s wife (according to another _s_\nakha) also silently puts one on the Garhapatya fire.\n\n[503:1](sbe44123.htm#fr_1321) See [p. 489](sbe44122.htm#page_489), note\n[2](sbe44122.htm#fn_1282).\n\n[503:2](sbe44123.htm#fr_1322) Lit., lying, i.e. not standing or moving.\n\n[503:3](sbe44123.htm#fr_1323) Cf.
