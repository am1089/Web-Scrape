The three currents 5 which are within this\n(city) support (it) 6 again and again, and those three channels run on, being\nconstituted by the three qualities. Darkness, passion, and goodness, these are\ncalled the three qualities, which are all coupled with one another, and\nlikewise serve one another, which depend on one another, and attend on one\nanother, and are joined to one another 7. And the five constituent principles\n\np. 319\n\n(are made up of) the three qualities. Goodness is the match of darkness, and\npassion is the match of goodness; and goodness is also the match of passion,\nand darkness the match of goodness. Where darkness is restrained, passion\nthere prevails. Where passion is restrained, goodness there prevails 1.\nDarkness should be understood to consist in obscurity. It has three qualities\n2, and is called delusion. Its characteristic is also impiety, and it is\nconstant in sinful actions. This is the nature of darkness; it also appears\ncombined (with others). Passion is said to consist in activity, and is the\ncause of successive 3 (acts). When it prevails, its characteristic, among all\nbeings, appears to be production 4. Light, lightness 5, faith, such is stated\nto be the nature of goodness (prevailing) among all beings, as accepted by\ngood men. The true nature of their characteristics, in aggregation and\nseparation, will now be stated together with the reasons; learn those\naccurately. Delusion, ignorance,\n\np. 320\n\nwant of liberality, indecision about actions 1, sleep, haughtiness 2, fear,\navarice, grief, finding fault with good acts, want of memory 3, immaturity (of\nintellect), nihilism 4, violation of (the rules of) conduct, want of\ndiscrimination 3, blindness, behaviour of the lowest 5 quality, pride of\nperformance without (actual) performance, pride of knowledge without (actual)\nknowledge, unfriendliness, evil disposition, want of faith, deluded\nconvictions, want of straightforwardness, want of knowledge 6, sinful action,\nwant of knowledge (of the subtle principle), stolidity 7, lassitude, want of\nself-restraint, going into inferior ways; all these qualities, O Brahma _n_\nas! are celebrated as being dark. And whatever other states of mind, connected\nwith delusion, are found in various places in this world, all these are dark\nqualities. Constant talk in disparagement of gods Brahma _n_ as and Vedas,\nwant of liberality, vanity, delusion 8, anger, want of forgiveness likewise,\nand also animosity\n\np. 321\n\ntowards people, this is considered to be dark conduct. Whatever vain 1 actions\n(there are), and whatever vain gifts, and vain eating, that is considered to\nbe dark conduct. Reviling, and want of forgiveness, animosity, vanity, want of\nfaith also, this is considered to be dark conduct. And whatever such people\nthere are in this world, doers of sinful acts. who break through (all)\nregulations, they are all held to be dark. I will state the wombs appointed\nfor these (men) of sinful actions. They go to the hell, (namely) the brute\n(species), to be born in the lower hell 2; (or become) the immovable entities\n3, animals, beasts of burden, demons, and serpents, and worms, insects, birds,\nand also creatures born from eggs, and all quadrupeds, and idiots, deaf and\ndumb men, and whatever others are attacked by diseases generated by sin 4.\nThese dark, evil-conducted men, who are sunk in darkness, who bear the marks\nof their own actions, the current of whose (thoughts) is downwards 5, sink\ninto darkness. I will now proceed to state their improvement and ascent; how,\nbecoming men of meritorious actions, they attain to the worlds of those who\nperform good acts 6. Resorting to a contrary 7 (course of life), and growing\nold in (good) actions 8, they exert\n\np. 322\n\nthemselves, and through the ceremonies (performed for them) by benevolent\nBrahma _n_ as devoted to their own duties, they go upwards to the same world\n(as the Brahma _n_ as)--the heaven of the gods. Such is the Vedic text.\nResorting to a contrary 1 (course of life), and growing old in their own\nduties, they become men in this world whose nature is to return 2. Coming to a\nsinful womb, as _K_ andalas 3, or deaf, or lisping men, they attain to higher\nand higher castes in order; going beyond the _S_ udra womb, and (beyond)\nwhatever other dark qualities there are which abide in the quality of darkness\n4 in the current (of this world). Attachment to objects of desire is laid down\nto be the great delusion. There, sages and saints and gods become deluded,\nwishing for pleasure. Darkness 5, delusion, the great delusion, the great\nobscurity called anger, and death the blinding obscurity; anger is called the\ngreat obscurity. I have now duly described to you, O Brahma _n_ as! this\nquality of darkness, in full and accurately with reference to\n\np. 323\n\nits nature, and also its qualities, and also. its source. Who, indeed,\nunderstands this properly; who, indeed, perceives this properly? The\ndefinition of the essence of darkness is, that one sees the real in what is\nunreal. The qualities of darkness have been described to you in many ways. And\ndarkness in its higher and lower [1](sbe0849.htm#fn_1557) (forms) has been\naccurately stated. The man who always understands these qualities gets rid of\nall dark qualities.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[317:1](sbe0847.htm#fr_1521) Namely, how they are all manifestations of the\nBrahman, and are all dissolved in it. Cf. inter alia Gita, pp.\n[74](sbe0809.htm#page_74), [92](sbe0813.htm#page_92).\n\n[317:2](sbe0847.htm#fr_1522) See the Kathopanishad, p. 149. Sec also [p.\n332](sbe0852.htm#page_332) infra.\n\n[317:3](sbe0847.htm#fr_1523) See [p. 313](sbe0847.htm#page_313), note\n[3](sbe0847.htm#fn_1497) supra.\n\n[317:4](sbe0847.htm#fr_1524) I. e. the mind. Cf. Gita, [p.\n102](sbe0814.htm#page_102).\n\n[317:5](sbe0847.htm#fr_1525) Viz. smell, sound, &c.\n\n[317:6](sbe0847.htm#fr_1526) Tranquillity, self-restraint, &c., Ar _g_ una Mi\n_s_ ra. Are they not rather the three qualities? As to 'twenty-four plus one'\nabove, see [p. 368](sbe0858.htm#page_368).\n\n[317:7](sbe0847.htm#fr_1527) Does this mean the senses, as at Gita, [p.\n123](sbe0820.htm#page_123)? An accurate understanding of the things noted\nrequires a knowledge of their relation to the supreme, which is the means of\nfinal emancipation. And see [p. 337](sbe0854.htm#page_337) infra.\n\n[317:8](sbe0848.htm#fr_1528) See Gita, [p. 107](sbe0816.htm#page_107), and Sa\n_n_ khya-sara, p. 11, and note  [2](sbe0851.htm#fn_1610), [p.\n331](sbe0851.htm#page_331) infra.\n\n[318:1](sbe0848.htm#fr_1529) The five gross elements of which the body is\ncomposed (cf. Mahabharata, _S_ anti Parvan, Moksha Dharma, chap. 183, st. 1\nseq.) are developments of the unperceived principle, the Prakriti. Cf. Gita,\n[p. 112](sbe0817.htm#page_112), where the words 'which remain (absorbed) in\nnature' have been inadvertently omitted after 'with the mind as the sixth.' As\nto the nine portals cf. Gita, [p. 65](sbe0807.htm#page_65).\n\n[318:2](sbe0848.htm#fr_1530) The five active organs, the five perceptive\nsenses, and the mind.\n\n[318:3](sbe0848.htm#fr_1531) This Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra takes to mean 'egoism.'\nNilaka _nth_ a takes the usual meaning, and adds, objects are produced from\nmental operations; 'distinguishing,' that is, manifesting as distinct\nentities.\n\n[318:4](sbe0848.htm#fr_1532) The eleven are, according to Ar _g_ una Mi _s_\nra, the three qualities, the five gross elements, the group of organs and\nsenses as one, egoism, and understanding.\n\n[318:5](sbe0848.htm#fr_1533) Viz. the na _d_ is, I _d_ a, Pi _n_ gala, and\nSushum _n_ a, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, who adds that they are respectively of the\nquality of darkness, passion, and goodness.\n\n[318:6](sbe0848.htm#fr_1534) The three na _d_ is, says Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra,\nsupport the life-winds. Nilaka _nth_ a takes the three currents to be the\nthreefold inclination of the mind, viz. towards a pure piety, towards injuring\nother living creatures, and towards that mixed piety which requires the\ndestruction of life for its performance. Nilaka _nth_ a also has a different\nreading from Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, which means 'are replenished' instead of\n'support.' And the three channels are, according to Nilaka _nth_ a, the Sa _m_\nskaras, or effects of previous actions of piety or impiety.\n\n[318:7](sbe0848.htm#fr_1535) Coupled = always existing in association with one\nanother; serving = being necessary to the operations of one another; depending\n= supporting one another like three staves, says Nilaka _nth_ a; p. 319\nupholding, says Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, as the total absence of one would lead\nto the absence of the others also; attending = becoming subordinate to\nwhichever of them is dominant for the time being; joined = so as to become one\norganic whole Cf. as to all this, Yoga-sutra II, 18, and commentary, p. 101;\nSa _n_ khya-karika, Karika 12, With Va _k_ aspati Mi _s_ ra's comments on it.\n\n[319:1](sbe0848.htm#fr_1536) Cf. Gita, [p. 108](sbe0816.htm#page_108), and the\nquotation in the Sa _n_ khyatattvakaumudi, p. 64.\n\n[319:2](sbe0848.htm#fr_1537) I. e. characteristics, viz. obscurity (which\nseems to stand for ignorance), delusion (which is false knowledge), and\nimpiety (doing that which is known to be sinful and wrong).\n\n[319:3](sbe0848.htm#fr_1538) The original means, according to Nilaka _nth_ a,\nwrong, unlawful conduct. As to all this cf. _S_ anti Parvan (Moksha), chap.\n194, St. 29.\n\n[319:4](sbe0848.htm#fr_1539) I. e. apparently perpetually doing something. Cf.\nGita, [p. 108](sbe0816.htm#page_108).\n\n[319:5](sbe0848.htm#fr_1540) Cf. as to this, and generally also, Sa _n_ khya-\nkarika 13, and commentary of Va _k_ aspati Mi _s_ ra (p. 64). The blazing\nupward., of fire is said to illustrate the lightness of the quality of\ngoodness which belongs to fire.\n\n[320:1](sbe0848.htm#fr_1541) According to Gita, [p.\n108](sbe0816.htm#page_108), doing nothing--stolid laziness--is a mark of\ndarkness. Cf. generally on this passage Gita, pp. [107](sbe0816.htm#page_107),\n[118](sbe0819.htm#page_118), [124](sbe0820.htm#page_124) seq.; Maitri, p. 49.\n\n[320:2](sbe0848.htm#fr_1542) The same word as at Gita, pp.\n[116](sbe0818.htm#page_116), [125](sbe0820.htm#page_125) (headstrong in the\nlatter passage should have been haughty). Cf. as to the word, _Kh_ andogya, p.\n383.\n\n[320:3](sbe0848.htm#fr_1545) Cf. Gita, [p. 51](sbe0804.htm#page_51).\n\n[320:4](sbe0848.htm#fr_1544) The opposite of the belief mentioned at Gita, [p.\n126](sbe0820.htm#page_126).\n\n[320:5](sbe0848.htm#fr_1546) The same word as at Gita, [p.\n109](sbe0816.htm#page_109). But the commentators render it here by hi _m_ sra,\ni. e. destructive.\n\n[320:6](sbe0848.htm#fr_1547) I am not sure about the original word here, and\nthe word next but one after this. The latter Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra renders by\nsukshmatattvavedanam, which I have translated above in the text. The former\nseems to mean general unintelligence.\n\n[320:7](sbe0848.htm#fr_1548) Heaviness and dulness, induced by indolence, &c.,\nNilaka _nth_ a. Lassitude is drooping from despondency. Going into inferior\nways, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says, means falling into the inferior castes;\nNilaka _nth_ a says it means love for base actions.\n\n[320:8](sbe0848.htm#fr_1549) Not being cognisant of one's own shortcomings, Ar\n_g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[321:1](sbe0848.htm#fr_1550) Cf. Gita, [p. 83](sbe0811.htm#page_83).\n\n[321:2](sbe0848.htm#fr_1551) Cf. Gita [p. 116](sbe0818.htm#page_116).\n\n[321:3](sbe0848.htm#fr_1552) Such as trees and so forth, which are also forms\nof life.\n\n[321:4](sbe0848.htm#fr_1553) This is alluded to in some Smritis too. And cf.\n_Kh_ andogya, p. 158, and the quotation in the commentary of Sa _n_ khya-sutra\nV, 122.\n\n[321:5](sbe0848.htm#fr_1554) Such, says Nilaka _nth_ a, as to fit them for the\nnether world See Tattvakaumudi, p.113. As to marks, cf. [p.\n239](sbe0829.htm#page_239) supra.\n\n[321:6](sbe0848.htm#fr_1555) Cf. Gita, [p. 130](sbe0820.htm#page_130).\n\n[321:7](sbe0848.htm#fr_1556) I. e. contrary to that already described as dark.\n\n[321:8](sbe0848.htm#fr_1557) Nilaka _nth_ a renders this to mean 'destroyed\nfor Agnihotra. and such ceremonies,' like the goat referred to above at [p.\n290](sbe0840.htm#page_290).\n\n[322:1](sbe0848.htm#fr_1558) See note  7 on last page. The sequence of ideas\nseems not to be properly brought out here. In the course of transmigration\nafter their course of conduct is altered they become men, and then proceed to\nheaven. This seems the real sense here.\n\n[322:2](sbe0848.htm#fr_1559) To return to life and death, and so on, until\nthey fit themselves for final emancipation. Cf. \xc3\x82pastamba II, 5, 11, 10-11.\n\n[322:3](sbe0848.htm#fr_1560) Cf. _Kh_ andogya, p. 359.\n\n[322:4](sbe0848.htm#fr_1561) This is not very clear, and the commentators give\nbut little help. The meaning probably is, that they gradually, in course of\nimprovement, cross beyond the Sudra caste, and all those qualities or tempers\nof mind, and so forth, which have been stated to appertain to the quality of\ndarkness.\n\n[322:5](sbe0848.htm#fr_1562) Cf. Sa _n_ khya-karika pp. 47, 48, and Va _k_\naspati's comment. There these are identified with the 'afflictions' of the\nYoga-sastra--ignorance, self-consciousness, affection, aversion, persistent\nattachment, and they are five divisions of false knowledge, or the quality of\ndarkness, as it is here called. See, too, _S_ veta _s_ vatara (comm.), p. 284.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXII](sbe0849.htm)\n\n"
