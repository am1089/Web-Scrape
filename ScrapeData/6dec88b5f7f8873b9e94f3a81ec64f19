Property.\n\n43. 43 All transactions depend on wealth. In order to acquire it, exertion is necessary. To preserve it,\n\np. 53\n\nto increase it, and to enjoy it: these are, successively, the three sorts of\nactivity in regard to wealth.\n\n44. 44 Again, wealth is of three kinds: white, spotted, and black. Each of these (three) kinds has seven subdivisions.\n\n* 45. 45 White wealth is (of the following seven sorts): what is acquired by sacred knowledge, valour in arms, the practice of austerities, with a maiden, through (instructing) a pupil, by sacrificing, and by inheritance. The gain to be derived from exerting oneself to acquire it is of the same description.\n\n* 46. 46 Spotted wealth is (of the following seven sorts): what is acquired by lending money at interest, tillage, commerce, in the shape of _S_ ulka, by artistic performances, by servile attendance, or as a return for a benefit conferred on some one.\n\n* 47. 47 Black wealth is (of the following seven\n\np. 54\n\nsorts): what is acquired as a bribe, by gambling, by bearing a message,\nthrough one afflicted with pain, by forgery, by robbery, or by fraud.\n\n48. 48 It is in wealth that purchase, sale, gift, receipt, transactions of every kind, and enjoyment, have their source.\n\n49. 49 Of whatever description the property may be, with which a man performs any transaction, of the same description will the fruit be which he derives from it in the next world and in this..\n\n50\\. Wealth is again declared to be of twelve sorts, according to the caste of\nthe acquirer. Those modes of acquisition, which are common to all castes, are\nthreefold. The others are said to be ninefold.\n\n51\\. Property obtained by inheritance, gifts made from love, and what has been\nobtained with a wife (as her dowry), these are the three sorts of pure wealth,\nfor all (castes) without distinction.\n\n52. 52 The pure wealth peculiar to a Brahman is\n\np. 55\n\ndeclared to be threefold: what has been obtained as alms, by sacrificing, and\nthrough (instructing) a pupil.\n\n53\\. The pure wealth peculiar to a Kshatriya is of three sorts likewise: what\nhas been obtained in the shape of taxes, by fighting, and by means of the\nfines declared in lawsuits.\n\n54\\. The pure wealth peculiar to a Vai _s_ ya is also declared to be\nthreefold: (what has been acquired) by tillage, by tending cows, and by\ncommerce. For a _S_ udra it consists of what is given to him by the members of\nthe three higher castes.\n\n55. 55 These are the legitimate modes of acquisition of wealth for all the (four) castes severally. If one caste should take to the occupations of another caste, it is a criminal proceeding, except in extreme cases of distress.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[52:43](sbe3310.htm#fr_156) 'All transactions,' whether originating in virtue,\ninterest, or love. The rule regarding the acquisition (and enjoyment) of\nwealth is said to be threefold: protection against bipeds, quadrupeds, p. 53\n&c.; increase, through agriculture, lending at interest, trading, and other\nmodes of acquisition; enjoyment of terrestrial and celestial pleasures. A.\n\n[53:44](sbe3310.htm#fr_157) 44-54. Vish _n_ u, chapter LVIII.\n\n[53:45](sbe3310.htm#fr_158) 'What is acquired by sacred knowledge,' i.e. the\ngains of sacred study. What is gained by 'the practice of austerities,' i.e.\nby one who duly performs greater and minor observances, optional and regular\nrites, and on whom worthy people bestow alms for that reason. What is received\n'with a maiden,' i.e. as her marriage portion. The fruit derived from\nrelinquishing white property is of the same kind, i.e. it is pure likewise.\nThus A.\n\n[53:46](sbe3310.htm#fr_159) 'Commerce,' the sale of merchandise. ' _S_ ulka,'\nthe price obtained for giving a damsel in marriage, whether the transaction be\nlawful or otherwise. 'Artistic performances,' the art of painting or another\nart. 'Servile attendance,' waiting upon, and paying homage to, another man.\nWealth obtained by one of these seven modes is called spotted, i.e. of a\nmiddling kind. A. Others explain the ambiguous term Sulka differently, as\ndenoting tolls, or a fare for crossing a river, &c.\n\n[53:47](sbe3310.htm#fr_160) 'Gambling,' with dice or otherwise. 'One afflicted\nwith p. 54 pain,' one pained by an attack of disease. 'Forging,'\nfalsification, of gold, silver, or other metals. 'Robbery,' such as theft.\n'Fraud,' deception. What has been acquired by one of these seven kinds is\ncalled 'black wealth,' i.e. wealth of the lowest kind. A.\n\n[54:48](sbe3310.htm#fr_161) From these three kinds of wealth, with their\ntwenty-one subdivisions, spring all the various kinds of transactions, and all\nkinds of enjoyment. A.\n\n[54:49](sbe3310.htm#fr_162) The difference between this and the previous\nclassification of the divers modes of acquisition seems to lie in this, that\nthe one system of classification is solely based on the respective legitimacy\nor illegitimacy of each mode of acquisition, whereas the diversity of caste\nrepresents the principle of classification in the other system. It should be\nborne in mind that an occupation, according to Indian notions, may be\nperfectly lawful for one caste, though it is unlawful for all others.\n\n[54:52](sbe3310.htm#fr_163) 52-54.
