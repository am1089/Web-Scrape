Born in or near Benares, of Mohammedan\nparents, and probably about the year 1440, be became in early life a disciple\nof the celebrated Hindu ascetic Ramananda. Ramananda had brought to Northern\nIndia the religious revival which Ramanuja, the great twelfth-century reformer\nof Brahmanism, had initiated in the South. This revival was in part a reaction\nagainst the increasing formalism of the orthodox cult, in part an assertion of\nthe demands of the heart as against\n\np. 6\n\nthe intense intellectualism of the Vedanta philosophy, the exaggerated monism\nwhich that philosophy proclaimed. It took in Ramanuja\'s preaching the form of\nan ardent personal devotion to the God Vishnu, as representing the personal\naspect of the Divine Nature: that mystical "religion of love" which everywhere\nmakes its appearance at a certain level of spiritual culture, and which creeds\nand philosophies are powerless to kill.\n\n   Though such a devotion is indigenous in Hinduism, and finds expression in\nmany passages of the Bhagavad Gita, there was in its mediaeval revival a large\nelement of syncretism. Ramananda, through whom its spirit is said to have\nreached Kabir, appears to have been a man of wide religious culture, and full\nof missionary enthusiasm. Living at the moment in which the impassioned poetry\nand deep philosophy\n\np. 7\n\nof the great Persian mystics, Attar, Sadi, Jalalu\'ddin Rumi, and Hafiz, were\nexercising a powerful influence on the religious thought of India, he dreamed\nof reconciling this intense and personal Mohammedan mysticism with the\ntraditional theology of Brahmanism. Some have regarded both these great\nreligious leaders as influenced also by Christian thought and life: but as\nthis is a point upon which competent authorities hold widely divergent views,\nits discussion is not attempted here. We may safely assert, however, that in\ntheir teachings, two--perhaps three--apparently antagonistic streams of\nintense spiritual culture met, as Jewish and Hellenistic thought met in the\nearly Christian Church: and it is one of the outstanding characteristics of\nKabir\'s genius that he was able in his poems to fuse them into one.\n\np. 8\n\n   A great religious reformer, the founder of a sect to which nearly a million\nnorthern Hindus still belong, it is yet supremely as a mystical poet that\nKabir lives for us. His fate has been that of many revealers of Reality. A\nhater of religious exclusivism, and seeking above all things to initiate men\ninto the liberty of the children of God, his followers have honoured his\nmemory by re-erecting in a new place the barriers which he laboured to cast\ndown. But his wonderful songs survive, the spontaneous expressions of his\nvision and his love; and it is by these, not by the didactic teachings\nassociated with his name, that he makes his immortal appeal to the heart. In\nthese poems a wide range of mystical emotion is brought into play: from the\nloftiest abstractions, the most otherworldly passion for the Infinite, to the\nmost intimate and personal realization\n\np. 9\n\nof God, expressed in homely metaphors and religious symbols drawn\nindifferently from Hindu and Mohammedan belief. It is impossible to say of\ntheir author that he was Brahman or Sufi, Vedantist or Vaishnavite. He is, as\nhe says himself, "at once the child of Allah and of Ram." That Supreme Spirit\nWhom he knew and adored, and to Whose joyous friendship he sought to induct\nthe souls of other men, transcended whilst He included all metaphysical\ncategories, all credal definitions; yet each contributed something to the\ndescription of that Infinite and Simple Totality Who revealed Himself,\naccording to their measure, to the faithful lovers of all creeds.\n\n   Kabir\'s story is surrounded by contradictory legends, on none of which\nreliance can be placed. Some of these emanate from a Hindu, some from a\n\np. 10\n\nMohammedan source, and claim him by turns as a Sufi and a Brahman saint. His\nname, however, is practically a conclusive proof of Moslem ancestry: and the\nmost probable tale is that which represents him as the actual or adopted child\nof a Mohammedan weaver of Benares, the city in which the chief events of his\nlife took place.\n\n   In fifteenth-century Benares the syncretistic tendencies of Bhakti religion\nhad reached full development. Sufis and Brahmans appear to have met in\ndisputation: the most spiritual members of both creeds frequenting the\nteachings of Ramananda, whose reputation was then at its height. The boy\nKabir, in whom the religious passion was innate, saw in Ramananda his destined\nteacher; but knew how slight were the chances that a Hindu guru would accept a\nMohammedan as disciple. He therefore hid upon the\n\np. 11\n\nsteps of the river Ganges, where Ramananda was accustomed to bathe; with the\nresult that the master, coming down to the water, trod upon his body\nunexpectedly, and exclaimed in his astonishment, "Ram! Ram!"--the name of the\nincarnation under which he worshipped God. Kabir then declared that he had\nreceived the mantra of initiation from Ramananda\'s lips, and was by it\nadmitted to discipleship. In spite of the protests of orthodox Brahmans and\nMohammedans, both equally annoyed by this contempt of theological landmarks,\nhe persisted in his claim; thus exhibiting in action that very principle of\nreligious synthesis which Ramananda had sought to establish in thought.\nRamananda appears to have accepted him, and though Mohammedan legends speak of\nthe famous Sufi Pir, Takki of Jhansi, as Kabir\'s master in later life, the\n\np. 12\n\nHindu saint is the only human teacher to whom in his songs he acknowledges\nindebtedness.\n\n   The little that we know of Kabir\'s life contradicts many current ideas\nconcerning the Oriental mystic. Of the stages of discipline through which he\npassed, the manner in which his spiritual genius developed, we are completely\nignorant. He seems to have remained for years the disciple of Ramananda,\njoining in the theological and philosophical arguments which his master held\nwith all the great Mullahs and Brahmans of his day; and to this source we may\nperhaps trace his acquaintance with the terms of Hindu and Sufi philosophy. He\nmay or may not have submitted to the traditional education of the Hindu or the\nSufi contemplative: it is clear, at any rate, that he never adopted the life\nof the professional ascetic, or retired from the\n\np. 13\n\nworld in order to devote himself to bodily mortifications and the exclusive\npursuit of the contemplative life. Side by side with his interior life of\nadoration, its artistic expression in music and words--for he was a skilled\nmusician as well as a poet--he lived the sane and diligent life of the\nOriental craftsman. All the legends agree on this point: that Kabir was a\nweaver, a simple and unlettered man, who earned his living at the loom. Like\nPaul the tentmaker, Boehme the cobbler, Bunyan the tinker, Tersteegen the\nribbon-maker, he knew how to combine vision and industry; the work of his\nhands helped rather than hindered the impassioned meditation of his heart.\nHating mere bodily austerities, he was no ascetic, but a married man, the\nfather of a family--a circumstance which Hindu legends of the monastic type\nvainly attempt to\n\np. 14\n\nconceal or explain--and it was from out of the heart of the common life that\nhe sang his rapturous lyrics of divine love. Here his works corroborate the\ntraditional story of his life. Again and again he extols the life of home, the\nvalue and reality of diurnal existence, with its opportunities for love and\nrenunciation; pouring contempt--upon the professional sanctity of the Yogi,\nwho "has a great beard and matted locks, and looks like a goat," and on all\nwho think it necessary to flee a world pervaded by love, joy, and beauty--the\nproper theatre of man\'s quest--in order to find that One Reality Who has\n"spread His form of love throughout all the world."[1]\n\n   It does not need much experience of ascetic literature to recognize the\nboldness and originality of this attitude in such a time and place. From the\n\n[1. Cf. Poems Nos. XXI, XL, XLIII, LXVI, LXXVI.]\n\np. 15\n\npoint of view of orthodox sanctity, whether Hindu or Mohammedan, Kabir was\nplainly a heretic; and his frank dislike of all institutional religion, all\nexternal observance--which was as thorough and as intense as that of the\nQuakers themselves--completed, so far as ecclesiastical opinion was concerned,\nhis reputation as a dangerous man. The "simple union" with Divine Reality\nwhich he perpetually extolled, as alike the duty and the joy of every soul,\nwas independent both of ritual and of bodily austerities; the God whom he\nproclaimed was "neither in Kaaba nor in Kailash." Those who sought Him needed\nnot to go far; for He awaited discovery everywhere, more accessible to "the\nwasherwoman and the carpenter" than to the self--righteous holy man.[1]\nTherefore the whole apparatus of piety, Hindu and Moslem\n\n[1. Poems I, II, XLI.]\n\np. 16\n\nalike--the temple and mosque, idol and holy water, scriptures and priests--\nwere denounced by this inconveniently clear-sighted poet as mere substitutes\nfor reality; dead things intervening between the soul and its love--\n\nThe images are all lifeless, they cannot speak:  \n    I know, for I have cried aloud to them.  \nThe Purana and the Koran are mere words:  \n    lifting up the curtain, I have seen.[1]\n\nThis sort of thing cannot be tolerated by any organized church; and it is not\nsurprising that Kabir, having his head-quarters in Benares, the very centre of\npriestly influence, was subjected to considerable persecution. The well-known\nlegend of the beautiful courtesan sent by Brahmans to tempt his virtue, and\nconverted, like the Magdalen, by her sudden encounter with the initiate of a\nhigher love, pre serves the memory of the fear and dislike\n\n[1. Poems XLII, LXV, LXVII.]\n\np. 17\n\nwith which he was regarded by the ecclesiastical powers. Once at least, after\nthe performance of a supposed miracle of healing, he was brought before the\nEmperor Sikandar Lodi, and charged with claiming the possession of divine\npowers. But Sikandar Lodi, a ruler of considerable culture, was tolerant of\nthe eccentricities of saintly persons belonging to his own faith. Kabir, being\nof Mohammedan birth, was outside the authority of the Brahmans, and\ntechnically classed with the Sufis, to whom great theological latitude was\nallowed. Therefore, though he was banished in the interests of peace from\nBenares, his life was spared. This seems to have happened in 1495, when he was\nnearly sixty years of age; it is the last event in his career of which we have\ndefinite knowledge. Thenceforth he appears to have moved about amongst various\n\np. 18\n\ncities of northern India, the centre of a group of disciples; continuing in\nexile that life of apostle and poet of love to which, as he declares in one of\nhis songs, he was destined "from the beginning of time." In 1518, an old man,\nbroken in health, and with hands so feeble that he could no longer make the\nmusic which he loved, he died at Maghar near Gorakhpur.\n\n   A beautiful legend tells us that after his death his Mohammedan and Hindu\ndisciples disputed the possession of his body; which the Mohammedans wished to\nbury, the Hindus to burn. As they argued together, Kabir appeared before them,\nand told them to lift the shroud and look at that which lay beneath. They did\nso, and found in the place of the corpse a heap of flowers; half of which were\nburied by the Mohammedans at Maghar, and half carried by the Hindus to the\nholy\n\np. 19\n\ncity of Benares to be burned--fitting conclusion to a life which had made\nfragrant the most beautiful doctrines of two great creeds.\n\n#### II\n\n   The poetry of mysticism might be defined on the one hand as a temperamental\nreaction to the vision of Reality: on the other, as a form of prophecy. As it\nis the special vocation of the mystical consciousness to mediate between two\norders, going out in loving adoration towards God and coming home to tell the\nsecrets of Eternity to other men; so the artistic self-expression of this\nconsciousness has also a double character. It is love-poetry, but love-poetry\nwhich is often written with a missionary intention.\n\nKabir\'s songs are of this kind: out-births at once of rapture and of charity.\nWritten in the popular Hindi, not in\n\np. 20\n\nthe literary tongue, they were deliberately addressed--like the vernacular\npoetry of Jacopone da Todi and Richard Rolle--to the people rather than to the\nprofessionally religious class; and all must be struck by the constant\nemployment in them of imagery drawn from the common life, the universal\nexperience. It is by the simplest metaphors, by constant appeals to needs,\npassions, relations which all men understand--the bridegroom and bride, the\nguru and disciple, the pilgrim, the farmer, the migrant bird--that he drives\nhome his intense conviction of the reality of the soul\'s intercourse with the\nTranscendent. There are in his universe no fences between the "natural" and\n"supernatural" worlds; everything is a part of the creative Play of God, and\ntherefore--even in its humblest details--capable of revealing the Player\'s\nmind.\n\np. 21\n\n   This willing acceptance of the here-and-now as a means of representing\nsupernal realities is a trait common to the greatest mystics. For them, when\nthey have achieved at last the true theopathetic state, all aspects of the\nuniverse possess equal authority as sacramental declarations of the Presence\nof God; and their fearless employment of homely and physical symbols--often\nstartling and even revolting to the unaccustomed taste--is in direct\nproportion to the exaltation of their spiritual life. The works of the great\nSufis, and amongst the Christians of Jacopone da Todi, Ruysbroeck, Boehme,\nabound in illustrations of this law. Therefore we must not be surprised to\nfind in Kabir\'s songs--his desperate attempts to communicate his ecstasy and\npersuade other men to share it--a constant juxtaposition of concrete and\nmetaphysical\n\np. 22\n\nlanguage; swift alternations between the most intensely anthropomorphic, the\nmost subtly philosophical, ways of apprehending man\'s communion with the\nDivine. The need for this alternation, and its entire naturalness for the mind\nwhich employs it, is rooted in his concept, or vision, of the Nature of God;\nand unless we make some attempt to grasp this, we shall not go far in our\nunderstanding of his poems.\n\n   Kabir belongs to that small group of supreme mystics--amongst whom St.\nAugustine, Ruysbroeck, and the Sufi poet Jalalu\'ddin Rumi are perhaps the\nchief--who have achieved that which we might call the synthetic vision of God.\nThese have resolved the perpetual opposition between the personal and\nimpersonal, the transcendent and immanent, static and dynamic aspects of the\nDivine Nature; between the Absolute of philosophy and the "sure\n\np. 23\n\ntrue Friend" of devotional religion. They have done this, not by taking these\napparently incompatible concepts one after the other; but by ascending to a\nheight of spiritual intuition at which they are, as Ruysbroeck said, "melted\nand merged in the Unity," and perceived as the completing opposites of a\nperfect Whole. This proceeding entails for them--and both Kabir and Ruysbroeck\nexpressly acknowledge it--a universe of three orders: Becoming, Being, and\nthat which is "More than Being," _i.e._ , God.[1] God is here felt to be not\nthe final abstraction, but the one actuality. He inspires, supports, indeed\ninhabits, both the durational, conditioned, finite world of Becoming and the\nunconditioned, non-successional, infinite world of Being; yet utterly\ntranscends them both. He is the omnipresent\n\n[1. Nos. VII and XLIX.]\n\np. 24\n\nReality, the "All-pervading" within Whom "the worlds are being told like\nbeads." In His personal aspect He is the "beloved Fakir," teaching and\ncompanioning each soul. Considered as Immanent Spirit, He is "the Mind within\nthe mind." But all these are at best partial aspects of His nature, mutually\ncorrective: as the Persons in the Christian doctrine of the Trinity--to which\nthis theological diagram bears a striking resemblance--represent different and\ncompensating experiences of the Divine Unity within which they are resumed. As\nRuysbroeck discerned a plane of reality upon which "we can speak no more of\nFather, Son, and Holy Spirit, but only of One Being, the very substance of the\nDivine Persons"; so Kabir says that "beyond both the limited and the limitless\nis He, the Pure Being."[1]\n\n[1. No. VII.]\n\np. 25\n\n   Brahma, then, is the Ineffable Fact compared with which "the distinction of\nthe Conditioned from the Unconditioned is but a word": at once the utterly\ntranscendent One of Absolutist philosophy, and the personal Lover of the\nindividual soul--"common to all and special to each," as one Christian mystic\nhas it. The need felt by Kabir for both these ways of describing Reality is a\nproof of the richness and balance of his spiritual experience; which neither\ncosmic nor anthropomorphic symbols, taken alone, could express. More absolute\nthan the Absolute, more personal than the human mind, Brahma therefore exceeds\nwhilst He includes all the concepts of philosophy, all the passionate\nintuitions of the heart. He is the Great Affirmation, the font of energy, the\nsource of life and love, the unique satisfaction of desire. His creative word\nis the _Om\n\n_\n\np. 26\n\nor "Everlasting Yea." The negative philosophy which strips from the Divine\nNature all Its attributes and defining Him only by that which He is not--\nreduces Him to an "Emptiness," is abhorrent to this most vital of poets.--\nBrahma, he says, "may never be found in abstractions." He is the One Love who\nPervades the world., discerned in His fullness only by the eyes of love; and\nthose who know Him thus share, though they may never tell, the joyous and\nineffable secret of the universe.[1]\n\n   Now Kabir, achieving this synthesis between the personal and cosmic aspects\nof the Divine Nature, eludes the three great dangers which threaten mystical\nreligion.\n\n   First, he escapes the excessive emotionalism, the tendency to an\nexclusively anthropomorphic devotion,\n\n[1. Nos. VII, XXVI, LXXVI, XC.]\n\np. 27\n\nwhich results from an unrestricted cult of Divine Personality, especially\nunder an incarnational form; seen in India in the exaggerations of Krishna\nworship, in Europe in the sentimental extravagances of certain Christian\nsaints.\n\n   Next, he is protected from the soul-destroying conclusions of pure monism,\ninevitable if its logical implications are pressed home: that is, the identity\nof substance between God and the soul, with its corollary of the total\nabsorption of that soul in the Being of God as the goal of the spiritual life.\nFor the thorough-going monist the soul, in so far as it is real, is\nsubstantially identical with God; and the true object of existence is the\nmaking patent of this latent identity, the realization which finds expression\nin the Vedantist formula "That art thou." But Kabir says that Brahma and the\ncreature are\n\np. 28\n\n"ever distinct, yet ever united"; that the wise man knows the spiritual as\nwell as the material world to "be no more than His footstool."[1] The soul\'s\nunion with Him is a love union, a mutual inhabitation; that essentially\ndualistic relation which all mystical religion expresses, not a self-mergence\nwhich leaves no place for personality. This eternal distinction, the\nmysterious union-in-separateness of God and the soul, is a necessary doctrine\nof all sane mysticism; for no scheme which fails to find a place for it can\nrepresent more than a fragment of that soul\'s intercourse with the spiritual\nworld. Its affirmation was one of the distinguishing features of the\nVaishnavite reformation preached by Ramanuja; the principle of which had\ndescended through Ramananda to Kabir.\n\n   Last, the warmly human and direct\n\n[1. Nos. VII and IX.]\n\np. 29\n\napprehension of God as the supreme Object of love, the soul\'s comrade,\nteacher, and bridegroom, which is so passionately and frequently expressed in\nKabir\'s poems, balances and controls those abstract tendencies which are\ninherent in the metaphysical side of his vision of Reality: and prevents it\nfrom degenerating into that sterile worship of intellectual formulae which\nbecame the curse of the Vedantist school. For the mere intellectualist, as for\nthe mere pietist, he has little approbation.[1] Love is throughout his\n"absolute sole Lord": the unique source of the more abundant life which he\nenjoys, and the common factor which unites the finite and infinite worlds. All\nis soaked in love: that love which he described in almost Johannine language\nas the "Form of God." The whole of creation is the Play of the Eternal Lover;\n\n[1. Cf. especially Nos. LIX, LXVII, LXXV, XC, XCI.]\n\np. 30\n\nthe living, changing, growing expression of Brahma\'s love and joy. As these\ntwin passions preside over the generation of human life, so "beyond the mists\nof pleasure and pain" Kabir finds them governing the creative acts of God. His\nmanifestation is love; His activity is joy. Creation springs from one glad act\nof affirmation: the Everlasting Yea, perpetually uttered within the depths of\nthe Divine Nature.[1] In accordance with this concept of the universe as a\nLove-Game which eternally goes forward, a progressive manifestation of Brahma\n--one of the many notions which he adopted from the common stock of Hindu\nreligious ideas, and illuminated by his poetic genius--movement, rhythm,\nperpetual change, forms an integral part of Kabir\'s vision of Reality. Though\nthe Eternal and Absolute is\n\n[1. Nos. XVII, XXVI, LXXVI, LXXXII.]\n\np. 31\n\never present to his consciousness, yet his concept of the Divine Nature is\nessentially dynamic. It is by the symbols of motion that he most often tries\nto convey it to us: as in his constant reference to dancing, or the strangely\nmodern picture of that Eternal Swing of the Universe which is "held by the\ncords of love."[1]\n\n   It is a marked characteristic of mystical literature that the great\ncontemplatives, in their effort to convey to us the nature of their communion\nwith the supersensuous, are inevitably driven to employ some form of sensuous\nimagery: coarse and inaccurate as they know such imagery to be, even at the\nbest. Our normal human consciousness is so completely committed to dependence\non the senses, that the fruits of intuition itself are instinctively referred\nto them. In that intuition it seems\n\n[1. No. XVI.]\n\np. 32\n\nto the mystics that all the dim cravings and partial apprehensions of sense\nfind perfect fulfilment. Hence their constant declaration that they _see_ the\nuncreated light, they _hear_ the celestial melody, they _taste_ the sweetness\nof the Lord, they know an ineffable fragrance, they feel the very contact of\nlove. "Him verily seeing and fully feeling, Him spiritually hearing and Him\ndelectably smelling and sweetly swallowing," as Julian of Norwich has it. In\nthose amongst them who develop psycho-sensorial automatisms, these parallels\nbetween sense and spirit may present themselves to consciousness in the form\nof hallucinations: as the light seen by Suso, the music heard by Rolle, the\ncelestial perfumes which filled St. Catherine of Siena\'s cell, the physical\nwounds felt by St. Francis and St. Teresa. These are excessive dramatizations\nof the symbolism under\n\np. 33\n\nwhich the mystic tends instinctively to represent his spiritual intuition to\nthe surface consciousness. Here, in the special sense-perception which he\nfeels to be most expressive of Reality, his peculiar idiosyncrasies come out.\n\n   Now Kabir, as we might expect in one whose reactions to the spiritual order\nwere so wide and various, uses by turn all the symbols of sense. He tells us\nthat he has "seen without sight" the effulgence of Brahma, tasted the divine\nnectar, felt the ecstatic contact of Reality, smelt the fragrance of the\nheavenly flowers. But he was essentially a poet and musician: rhythm and\nharmony were to him the garments of beauty and truth. Hence in his lyrics he\nshows himself to be, like Richard Rolle, above all things a musical mystic.\nCreation, he says again and again, is full of music: it _is_ music. At the\nheart of the Universe\n\np. 34\n\n"white music is blossoming": love weaves the melody, whilst renunciation beats\nthe time. It can be heard in the home as well as in the heavens; discerned by\nthe ears of common men as well as by the trained senses of the ascetic.\nMoreover, the body of every man is a lyre on which Brahma, "the source of all\nmusic," plays. Everywhere Kabir discerns the "Unstruck Music of the Infinite"\n--that celestial melody which the angel played to St. Francis, that ghostly\nsymphony which filled the soul of Rolle with ecstatic joy.[1] The one figure\nwhich he adopts from the Hindu Pantheon and constantly uses, is that of\nKrishna the Divine Flute Player.[2] He sees the supernal music, too, in its\nvisual embodiment, as rhythmical movement: that mysterious dance of the\nuniverse before the\n\n[1. Nos. XVII, XVIII, XXXIX, XLI, LIV, LXXVI, LXXXIII, LXXXIX, XCVII.\n\n2\\. Nos. L, LIII, LXVIII.]\n\np. 35\n\nface of Brahma, which is at once an act of worship and an expression of the\ninfinite rapture of the Immanent God.\'\n\n   Yet in this wide and rapturous vision of the universe Kabir never loses\ntouch with diurnal existence, never forgets the common life. His feet are\nfirmly planted upon earth; his lofty and passionate apprehensions are\nperpetually controlled by the activity of a sane and vigorous intellect, by\nthe alert commonsense so often found in persons of real mystical genius. The\nconstant insistence on simplicity and directness, the hatred of all\nabstractions and philosophizings,[1] the ruthless criticism of external\nreligion: these are amongst his most marked characteristics. God is the Root\nwhence all manifestations, "material" and "spiritual," alike proceed; and God\nis the only need of\n\n[1. Nos. XXVI, XXXII, LXXVI.\n\n2\\. Nos. LXXV, LXXVIII, LXXX, XC.]\n\np. 36\n\nman--"happiness shall be yours when you come to the Root."[1] Hence to those\nwho keep their eye on the "one thing needful," denominations, creeds,\nceremonies, the conclusions of philosophy, the disciplines of asceticism, are\nmatters of comparative indifference. They represent merely the different\nangles from which the soul may approach that simple union with Brahma which is\nits goal; and are useful only in so far as they contribute to this\nconsummation. So thorough-going is Kabir\'s eclecticism, that he seems by turns\nVedantist and Vaishnavite, Pantheist and Transcendentalist, Brahman and Sufi.\nIn the effort to tell the truth about that ineffable apprehension, so vast and\nyet so near, which controls his life, he seizes and twines together--as he\nmight have woven together contrasting threads upon his loom--\n\n[1. No. LXXX.]\n\np. 37\n\nsymbols and ideas drawn from the most violent and conflicting philosophies and\nfaiths. All are needed, if he is ever to suggest the character of that One\nwhom the Upanishad called "the Sun-coloured Being who is beyond this\nDarkness": as all the colours of the spectrum are needed if we would\ndemonstrate the simple richness of white light. In thus adapting traditional\nmaterials to his own use he follows a method common amongst the mystics; who\nseldom exhibit any special love for originality of form. They will pour their\nwine into almost any vessel that comes to hand: generally using by preference\n--and lifting to new levels of beauty and significance--the religious or\nphilosophic formulae current in their own day. Thus we find that some of\nKabir\'s finest poems have as their subjects the commonplaces of Hindu\nphilosophy and religion: the\n\np. 38\n\nLila or Sport of God, the Ocean of Bliss, the Bird of the Soul, Maya, the\nHundred-petalled Lotus, and the "Formless Form." Many, again, are soaked in\nSufi imagery and feeling. Others use as their material the ordinary\nsurroundings and incidents of Indian life: the temple bells, the ceremony of\nthe lamps, marriage, suttee, pilgrimage, the characters of the seasons; all\nfelt by him in their mystical aspect, as sacraments of the soul\'s relation\nwith Brahma. In many of these a particularly beautiful and intimate feeling\nfor Nature is shown.\'\n\n   In the collection of songs here translated there will be found examples\nwhich illustrate nearly every aspect of Kabir\'s thought, and all the\nfluctuations of the mystic\'s emotion: the ecstasy, the despair, the still\nbeatitude, the eager self-devotion, the flashes of wide illumination,\n\n[1. Nos. XV, XXIII, LXVII, LXXXVII, XCVII.]\n\np. 39\n\nthe moments of intimate love. His wide and deep vision of the universe, the\n"Eternal Sport" of creation (LXXXII), the worlds being "told like beads"\nwithin the Being of God (XIV, XVI, XVII, LXXVI), is here seen balanced by his\nlovely and delicate sense of intimate communion with the Divine Friend, Lover,\nTeacher of the soul (X, XI, XXIII, XXXV, LI, LXXXV, LXXXVI, LXXXVIII, XCII,\nXCIII; above all, the beautiful poem XXXIV). As these apparently paradoxical\nviews of Reality are resolved in Brahma, so all other opposites are reconciled\nin Him: bondage and liberty, love and renunciation, pleasure and pain (XVII,\nXXV, XL, LXXIX). Union with Him is the one thing that matters to the soul, its\ndestiny and its need (LI, I, II, LIV, LXX, LXXIV, XCIII, XCVI); and this\nunion, this discovery of God, is the simplest and most natural\n\np. 40\n\nof all things, if we would but grasp it (XLI, XLVI, LVI, LXXII, LXXVI,\nLXXVIII, XCVII). The union, however, is brought about by love, not by\nknowledge or ceremonial observances (XXXVIII, LIV, LV, LIX, XCI); and the\napprehension which that union confers is ineffable--"neither This nor That,"\nas Ruysbroeck has it (IX, XLVI, LXXVI). Real worship and communion is in\nSpirit and in Truth (XL, XLI, LVI, LXIII, LXV, LXX), therefore idolatry is an\ninsult to the Divine Lover (XLII, LXIX) and the devices of professional\nsanctity are useless apart from charity and purity of soul (LIV, LXV, LXVI).\nSince all things, and especially the heart of man, are God-inhabited, God-\npossessed (XXVI, LVI, LXXVI, LXXXIX, XCVII), He may best be found in the here-\nand-now: in the normal. human, bodily existence, the "mud" of material\n\np. 41\n\nlife (III, IV, VI, XXI, XXXIX, XL, XLIII, XLVIII, LXXII). "We can reach the\ngoal without crossing the road" (LXXVI)--not the cloister but the home is the\nproper theatre of man\'s efforts: and if he cannot find God there, he need not\nhope for success by going farther afield. "In the home is reality." There love\nand detachment, bondage and freedom, joy and pain play by turns upon the soul;\nand it is from their conflict that the Unstruck Music of the Infinite\nproceeds. Kabir says: "None but Brahma can evoke its melodies."\n\n   "This version of Kabir\'s songs is chiefly the work of Mr. Rabindranath\nTagore, the trend of whose mystical genius makes him--as all who read these\npoems will see--a peculiarly sympathetic interpreter of Kabir\'s\n\np. 42\n\nvision and thought. It has been based upon the printed Hindi text with Bengali\ntranslation of Mr. Kshiti Mohan Sen; who has gathered from many sources--\nsometimes from books and manuscripts, sometimes from the lips of wandering\nascetics and minstrels--a large collection of poems and hymns to which Kabir\'s\nname is attached, and carefully sifted the authentic songs from the many\nspurious works now attributed to him. These painstaking labours alone have\nmade the present undertaking possible.\n\n   We have also had before us a manuscript English translation of 116 songs\nmade by Mr. Ajit Kumar Chakravarty from Mr. Kshiti Mohan Sen\'s text, and a\nprose essay upon Kabir from the same hand. From these we have derived great\nassistance. A considerable number of readings from the translation have been\nadopted by us;\n\np. 43\n\nwhilst several of the facts mentioned in the essay have been incorporated into\nthis introduction. Our most grateful thanks are due to Mr. Ajit Kumar\nChakravarty for the extremely generous and unselfish manner in which he has\nplaced his work at our disposal.\n\nE.

F. Blumhardt.\n\np. 44\n\np. 45\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I](sok002.htm)\n\n'
