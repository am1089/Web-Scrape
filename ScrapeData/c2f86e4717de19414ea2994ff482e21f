The contention that consciousness is not an\nobject holds good for the knowing Self at the\n\np. 48\n\ntime when it illumines (i.e. constitutes as its objects) other things; but\nthere is no absolute rule as to all consciousness never being anything but\nself-luminous. For common observation shows that the consciousness of one\nperson may become the object of the cognition of another, viz. of an inference\nfounded on the person's friendly or unfriendly appearance and the like, and\nagain that a person's own past states of consciousness become the object of\nhis own cognition--as appears from judgments such as 'At one time I knew.' It\ncannot therefore be said 'If it is consciousness it is self-proved' (above [p.\n33](sbe48007.htm#page_33)), nor that consciousness if becoming an object of\nconsciousness would no longer be consciousness; for from this it would follow\nthat one's own past states, and the conscious states of others--because being\nobjects of consciousness--are not themselves consciousness. Moreover, unless\nit were admitted that there is inferential knowledge of the thoughts of\nothers, there would be no apprehension of the connexion of words and meaning,\nand this would imply the absolute termination of all human intercourse\ndepending on speech. Nor also would it be possible for pupils to attach\nthemselves to a teacher of sacred lore, for the reason that they had become\naware of his wisdom and learning. The general proposition that consciousness\ndoes not admit of being an object is in fact quite untenable. The essential\n'nature of consciousness or knowledge--consists therein that it shines forth,\nor manifests itself, through its own being to its own substrate at the present\nmoment; or (to give another definition) that it is instrumental in proving its\nown object by its own being 1\n\np. 49\n\nNow these two characteristics are established by a person's own state of\nconsciousness and do not vanish when that consciousness becomes the object of\nanother state of consciousness; consciousness remains also in the latter case\nwhat it is. Jars and similar things, on the other hand, do not possess\nconsciousness, not because they are objects of consciousness but because they\nlack the two characteristics stated above. If we made the presence of\nconsciousness dependent on the absence of its being an object of\nconsciousness, we should arrive at the conclusion\n\np. 50\n\nthat consciousness is not consciousness; for there are things--e.g. sky-\nflowers--which are not objects of consciousness and at the same time are not\nconsciousness. You will perhaps reply to this that a sky-flower's not being\nconsciousness is due not to its not being an object of consciousness, but to\nits non-existence!--Well then, we rejoin, let us say analogously that the\nreason of jars and the like not being contradictory to Nescience (i.e. of\ntheir being _g_ a _d_ a), is their not being of the nature of consciousness,\nand let us not have recourse to their being objects of consciousness!--But if\nconsciousness is an object of consciousness, we conclude that it also is non-\ncontradictory of Nescience, like a jar!--At this conclusion, we rejoin, you\nmay arrive even on the opposite assumption, reasoning as follows:\n'Consciousness is non-contradictory of Nescience, because it is not an object\nof consciousness, like a sky-flower! All which shows that to maintain as a\ngeneral principle that something which is an object of consciousness cannot\nitself be consciousness is simply ridiculous.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[48:1](sbe48017.htm#fr_10) The comment of the Sru. Pra. on the above\ndefinitions runs, with a few additional explanations, as follows: The term\n'anubhuti' here denotes knowledge in general, not only such knowledge as is\nnot remembrance (which limited meaning the term has sometimes). With reference\nto the 'shining forth' it might be said that in this way jars also and similar\nthings know or are conscious because they also shine forth' (viz. in so far as\nthey are known); to exclude jars and the like the text therefore adds 'to its\nown substrate' (the jar 'shines forth,' not to itself, but to the p. 49\nknowing person). There are other attributes of the Self, such as atomic\nextension, eternity, and so on, which are revealed (not through themselves)\nbut through an act of knowledge different from them; to exclude those the text\nadds 'through its own being.' In order to exclude past states of consciousness\nor acts of knowledge, the text adds 'at the present moment.' A past state of\nconsciousness is indeed not revealed without another act of knowledge\n(representing it), and would thus by itself be excluded; but the text adds\nthis specification (viz. 'at the present moment') on purpose, in order to\nintimate that a past state of consciousness can be represented by another\nstate--a point denied by the opponent. 'At the present moment' means 'the\nconnexion with the object of knowledge belonging to the present time.' Without\nthe addition of 'to its own substrate' the definition might imply that a state\nof consciousness is manifest to another person also; to exclude this the\nclause is added. This first definition might be objected to as acceptable only\nto those who maintain the svaya _m_ prakasatva-theory (which need not be\ndiscussed here); hence a second definition is given.The two clauses 'to its\nown substrate' and 'at the present moment' have to be supplied in this second\ndefinition also. 'Instrumental in bringing about' would apply to staffs,\nwheels, and such like implements also; hence the text adds 'its own object.'\n(Staffs, wheels, &c. have no 'objects.') Knowledge depending on sight does not\nbring about an object depending on hearing; to exclude this notion of\nuniversal instrumentality the text specifies the object by the words 'its\nown.' The clause 'through its own being' excludes the sense organs, which\nreveal objects not by their own being, but in so far as they give rise to\nknowledge. The two clauses 'at the present moment' and 'to its own substrate'\nhave the same office in the second definition as in the first.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Consciousness is not eternal](sbe48018.htm)\n\n"
