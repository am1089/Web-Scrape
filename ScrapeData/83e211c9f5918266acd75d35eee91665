Charm against poison.\n\n1\\. This water (var) in the (river) Varanavati shall ward off (varayatai)!\nAmrita (ambrosia) has been poured into it: with that do I ward off (varaye)\npoison from thee.  \n2\\. Powerless is the poison from the east, powerless that from the north.\nMoreover the poison from the south transforms itself into a porridge.  \n3\\. Having made thee (the poison) that comes from a horizontal direction into\na porridge, rich in fat, and cheering, from sheer hunger he has eaten thee,\nthat hast an evil body: do thou not cause injury!  \n4\\. Thy bewildering quality (madam), O (plant?) that art bewildering\n(madivati), we cause to fall like a reed. As a boiling pot of porridge do we\nremove thee by (our) charm.  \n5\\. (Thee, O poison) that art, as it were, heaped about the village, do we\ncause to stand still by (our) charm. Stand still as a tree upon its place; do\nnot, thou that hast been dug with the spade, cause injury!  \n6\\. With broom-straw (?), garments, and also with skins they purchased thee: a\nthing for barter art thou, O plant! Do not, thou that hast been dug with the\nspade, cause injury!  \n7\\. Those of you who were of yore unequalled in the deeds which they\nperformed-may the), not injure here our men: for this very purpose do I engage\nyou!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 100.
