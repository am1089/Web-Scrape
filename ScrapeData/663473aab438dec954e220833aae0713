I deem Agni to be the munificent Hot _ri_ , the Vasu, the Son of strength\n[1](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:1:1), _G_ atavedas, like a priest, _G_ atavedas\n[2](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:1:2): the best performer of the sacrifice, the god\nwho with his upright body that is turned towards the gods, and with his flame\nlongs for the shine of the (boiling) ghee [3](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:1:3), of\nthe butter that is offered in (the fire).\n\n2\\. May we, the sacrificers, call thee hither, the best of sacrificers\n[1](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:2:1), the first of the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, O priest, with our\nprayers, with priestly prayers, O bright one [2](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:2:2):\nthee who like the heaven encompassest the earth\n[3](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:2:3), the Hot _ri_ of human tribes, the manly flame-\nhaired, whom these folks--whom all folks should favour in order to speed him\n(to our sacrifice).\n\n3\\. He indeed, shining mightily with his shining strength\n[1](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:3:1), becomes the conqueror of deceitful foes\n[2](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:3:2)--like an axe, the conqueror of deceitful foes\n[2](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:3:2). He at whose onslaught\n[3](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:3:3) even what is strong melts away\n[4](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:3:4), steady things (waste away) like forests (which\nare burnt or bend down in the storm) [5](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:3:5).\nConquering he holds himself back; he does not proceed\n[6](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:3:6). As with a conquering bow-man he proceeds\n[6](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:3:6).\n\n4\\. Even what is firm gives way before him: thus it is known. With hottest\nkindling-sticks [1](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:4:1) one worships him\n[2](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:4:2) for winning his favour, one worships Agni for\nwinning his favour. He who dives into many forests as if carving the wood with\nhis flame, destroys even firm food [3](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:4:3) with his\nstrength--he destroys even what is firm with his strength.\n\np. 130\n\n5\\. Let us place that power [1](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:5:1) of his in our\nneighbourhood [2](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:5:2)--(that power) which is more\nvisible by night than by day [3](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:5:3)--(more visible)\nthan by day to the unremitting [4](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:5:4) (worshipper).\nTherefore his life is a firm hold [5](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:5:5), like (a\nfather\'s) safe refuge to a son: (the fires) that never grow old, tending to\nblessings enjoyed or not enjoyed (before) [6](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:5:6)--the\nfires that never grow old, tending (to such blessings).\n\n6\\. He indeed makes a mighty noise like the host of the Maruts, \xe2\x80\xa6\n[1](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:6:1) on the rich fields, \xe2\x80\xa6\n[1](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:6:1) on the \xe2\x80\xa6 [1](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:6:1). He,\nthe seizer, ate the offerings [2](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:6:2), he who has\ndeservedly become the banner of the sacrifice. And when he joyously and\njoyfully (proceeds), all followed gladly on his path; men (have followed) his\npath as for a triumphal procession.\n\n7\\. When forsooth the Kistas [1](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:7:1) striving for\nheaven, when the Bh _ri_ gus have addressed him paying reverence--the Bh _ri_\ngus producing him by attrition, with worship: Agni is the lord of goods, the\nbright one, who is their [2](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:7:2) supporter. May the\nwise one accept the wonted coverings [3](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:7:3); may the\nwise one accept them.\n\n8\\. We invoke thee, the lord of all people, the common master of the house of\nall, to enjoy (the sacrifice): (we call) thee who truly art carried by prayers\nas by a vehicle [1](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:8:1) to enjoy (the sacrifice): the\nguest of men in whose presence (they live) as before a father\'s (face), and\nall those immortals (attain) to strength, and the offerings among the gods\n(attain) to strength.\n\n9\\. Thou, O Agni, art born, the mightiest by might\n[1](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:9:1), for the divine world, the strongest one, like\nwealth for the divine world. For thy delight is most strong, and thy power is\nmost brilliant. And\n\np. 131\n\nthey walk around thee [2](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:9:2), O (god) who never\ngrowest old, like obedient (servants), O (god) who never growest old.\n\n10\\. Let your praise go forth to the great Agni, who is mighty in his might,\nwho awakens at dawn, like a winner of cattle\n[1](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:10:1)--let it go forth to Agni. When (the\nworshipper) rich in offerings has loudly praised him\n[2](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:10:2) in all lands [3](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:10:3),\nhe wakes [4](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:10:4) like a singer in front of the dawns\n[5](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:10:5), the flaming one (?), the Hot _ri_ (in front)\nof the dawns [5](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:10:5).\n\n11\\. Thus being seen by us, bring near to us, O Agni, graciously united with\nthe gods, benignantly, great wealth benignantly. Make us behold great (bliss\nof valiant offspring [1](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:11:1)), O mightiest one, that\nwe may obtain such enjoyment. Produce great bliss of valiant offspring, O\nbountiful Lord, (as fire is produced) by attrition, for those who praise thee,\nlike a strong hero in thy might.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe _Ri_ shi is Paru _k_ _kh_ epa Daivodasi, the metre Atyash _t_ i (verse 6\nAtidh _ri_ ti).--Verses 1-3 = SV. II, 1163-1165\\. Verse 1 = SV. I, 465; VS.\nXV, 47; TS. IV, 4, 4, 8; MS. II, 13, 8; AV. XX, 67, 3.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. There is no doubt that the reading of the Rig-veda text vasum is\ncorrect; the Sama-veda has vaso _h_. Comp. H. O., Prolegomena, p. 280.\n\nNote 2. \'Is it a play on the word? Like a priest knowing all things?\' M. M.\n\nNote 3. There is a metrical irregularity in this Pada; it has six syllables\ninstead of five before the caesura. The text, however, seems to be correct.\n\np. 132\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. The first Pada is Trish _t_ ubh instead of _G_ agati. It would be easy\nto correct huvemahi, but that form is never found in the Rig-veda, though both\nhuvema and havamahe are frequent. Thus it is very probable that we have here a\nmetrical irregularity of the type described by H. O., Prolegomena, p. 117.\n\nNote 2. Comp. VIII, 60, 3. viprebhi _h_ _s_ ukra manmabhi _h_.\n\nNote 3. If the explanation of pari _g_ man which we have adopted (see above,\nI, 79, 3, note 2) is correct, it will be impossible, of course, to accept\nBergaigne\'s opinion (Rel. Ved., II, 505, note I) that the accusative dya\xc2\xb4m is\ngoverned by pari _g_ manam.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. In the second Pada one syllable is wanting. The text seems to be\ncorrect, and the irregularity apparently is the typical one described by H.\nO., Prolegomena, p. 68 seq.: the Pada has the tetrasyllabic beginning (before\nthe caesura), and it goes on as if the beginning had been pentasyllabic.\nSeveral Padas of the same irregular structure occur in our hymn, thus in verse\n9: tvam (read tuam) agne || sahasa sahantama _h_ ; verse 10: pra va _h_ mahe\n|| sahasa sahasvate; usha _h_ -budhe || pa _s_ u-se na agnaye.\n\nNote 2. The comparison para _s_ u _h_ na, \'like an axe,\' raises doubts as to\nthe correctness of druham-tara _h_. Para _s_ u _h_ seems to point to a\ncompound containing the element dru, \'wood;\' comp. below, 130, 4; VII, 104,\n21. The second member of the compound would be han, which is frequently used\nwith the meaning of cutting wood (II, 14, 2; X, 89, 7). Thus the reading would\nbe dru-hantara _h_ (comp. v _ri_ tra-hantama _h_ ), \'a mighty wood-cutter.\' As\nto this use of the comparative, see Delbruck. Altindische Syntax, p. 196.\n\nNote 3. Comp. V, 7, 2. yasya sam _ri_ tau.\n\nNote 4. Prof. Max Muller (Science of Thought, p. 325) . believes that the root\n_s_ ru occurs here in the sense of shaking. To me it seems that this _s_ ruvat\nis a misspelling\n\np. 133\n\nfor sruvat. The opinion of Pischel and Geldner (Vedische Studien, I, p. vi) is\ndifferent.\n\nNote 5. The meaning of the comparison which I have indicated by the words in\nparentheses, becomes clear from VIII, 40, 1. vana-iva va\xc2\xb4te it.\n\nNote 6. The two last Padas are very obscure. In the last Pada but one na would\nseem to be comparative, not negative, because it has the same meaning in the\nlast Pada, and because its vowel does not coalesce with the following initial\nvowel (comp. Benfey\'s dissertation, \'Behandlung des auslautenden a in na "wie"\nand na "nicht."\' But then instead of yamate a substantive meaning something\nlike \'hero\' would be required. And also instead of the instrumental dhanva-\nsaha one should expect to find a nominative; comp. Benfey, Vedica and\nLinguistica, p. 180, note 1.--Prof. Max Muller translates: \'Holding out (or\nresisting) he stands firm, he does not budge; holding his bow he does not\nbudge.\'\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. The words te _g_ ish _th_ abhi _h_ ara _n_ ibhi _h_ are repeated,\nprobably by the same poet, below, 129, 5.\n\nNote 2. It may be observed that several times in the Paru _k_ _kh_ epa hymns\nthe parallelism between two subsequent Padas has corrupted the text, the\nreading of the one Pada being wrongly introduced into the other. For instances\nI refer to I, 129, 11, where the last vaso has been added from the preceding\nPada, and to the last Pada but one of I, 135, 4. Possibly our Pada, which in\nits traditional form is metrically abnormal (comp., however, M. M.\'s Hymns to\nthe Maruts, 1st ed., p. cxii), has suffered damage in the same way. The\ncomparison of I, 129, 5 would lead us to conjecture: te _g_ ish _th_ abhi _h_\nara _n_ ibhi _h_ na avase. \'One worships him in order that he may grant his\nfavour as if (he were to help us) with hottest kindling-sticks. One worships\nAgni in order that he may grant his favour.\'\n\nNote 3. Comp. IV, 7, 10. sthira\xc2\xb4 _k_ it anna dayate vi _g_ ambhai _h_. The\nfood is the wood which Agni consumes.\n\np. 134\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. See Prof. von Roth\'s translation of this verse, Zeitschrift der D.\nMorg. Gesellschaft, XLVIII, 117. On p _ri_ ksham, comp. M. M., vol. xxxii, p.\n302; Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, p. 96 seq. The translation of such a word\ncan only be tentative.\n\nNote 2. To uparasu something like vikshu (IV, 37, 3) seems to be supplied.\n\nNote 3. Comp. the Latin expression, \'argutius quam verius.\' Pischel, Gottinger\nGelehrte Anzeigen, 1884, p. 516 seq.; Delbruck, Altindische Syntax, p. 196.\n\nNote 4. \xc3\x81prayus seems to be an anomalous formation, instead of aprayu, unless\nwe have to read aprayuve. According to Pischel (Gottinger Gel. Anzeigen, 1890,\np. 542), aprayushe would mean \'dem der da lebt.\' But I do not think that this\naprayus should be separated from aprayu, which, as may be seen from I, 89, I\ncompared with III, 5, 6 and X, 4, 7, is identical in meaning with, and\nevidently etymologically related to, aprayu _k_ _kh_ ant.\n\nNote 5. Grabha _n_ avat is the contrary of agrabha _n_ a, I, 116, 5.\n\nNote 6. Comp. III, 30, 7. abhaktam _k_ it bha _g_ ate.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Ludwig: \'in den bebauten fluren zu verehren, auf den wusten flachen zu\nverehren.\' Prof. Max Muller observes with regard to ish _t_ ani _h_ : \'it\nstani _h_ , or ish + stani _h_ (ish-karta), much thundering.\' For a\xc2\xb4rtana he\nproposes the translation, \'ploughed field.\' I have left both words un-\ntranslated.\n\nNote 2. \xc3\x82\xc2\xb4dat is imperfect of ad; there is a play upon words (a\xc2\xb4dat and a-dadi\n_h_ ).\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. Who the Kistas (cf. Lanman, p. 346) are is not known. They seem,\nhowever, either to be identical with the Bh _ri_ gus or to be another ancient\nand probably mythical family of priests like them. They are mentioned also in\nVI, 67, 10.\n\np. 135\n\nNote 2. \'Their\' refers to \'goods.\'\n\nNote 3. The fuel and libations with which Agni is covered?\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. Va\xc2\xb4has and its compounds, such as stomavahas, ukthavahas, girvahas,\nhave been treated of by Dr. Neisser in his ingenious article on vahni,\nBezzenberger\'s Beitrage, XVIII, 301 seq. (comp. on vahni, vol. xxxii, p. 37\nseq.). Dr. Neisser tries to show that by the side of vahni, derived from vah =\nLatin vehere, and meaning \'draught-horse\' (and besides--though Dr. Neisser\ndoes not admit this, see p. 316--\'a person that drives in a chariot\'), there\nexisted a second substantive vahni connected with the Greek \xce\xb5\xe1\xbd\x94\xcf\x87\xce\xb5\xcf\x83\xce\xb8\xce\xb1\xce\xb9, and\nmeaning both \'erhaben\' and \'erhebend,\' i. e. praising the gods (loc. cit., p.\n314). With this second vahni he connects va\xc2\xb4has and its compounds. One of the\nprincipal arguments of Dr. Neisser is the fact quite correctly stated by him\n(p. 301), that \'the word vahni very frequently associates itself to the term\nhot _ri_ , while it does not with the compounds havyavah and havyava\xc2\xb4hana.\'\nThis fact, indeed, points to the conclusion that \'those compounds belong to\nanother sphere of ideas than vahni\' (p. 302). But Dr. Neisser seems to me to\ngo too far in concluding that vahni, standing as an epithet of Agni, is not\nderived from vah = vehere. Agni\'s action consists not only in carrying the\nsacrificial food to the gods, but also in carrying the gods to the sacrifice\nof men, and in coming to that sacrifice himself with his chariot and his\nhorses. Nor do the words stomavahas or ukthavahas, if derived from vah =\nvehere, necessarily presuppose the admissibility of expressions such as\n\'uktham (stomam) vahati vipra _h_ devan a _k_ _kh_ a\' (p. 303), but those\ncompounds may also rest on an idea conveyed by expressions such as \'uktham\n(stoma _h_ ) vahati devan upa ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ am,\' which idea is quite Vedic. Thus\nstomavahas in my opinion means, as an epithet of the god, \'carried by the\nstoma as by a vehicle\' (comp. VII, 24, 5. esha stoma _h_ mahe ugra\xc2\xb4ya va\xc2\xb4he\ndhuri-iva atya _h_ na va _g_ ayan adhayi). or, as an epithet of the human\nworshippers, fitting out the\n\np. 136\n\nstoma as a vehicle.\' I believe that the words in question can thus be\nexplained in conformity with the whole range of Vedic thought, and the\nartificial distinction of two different substantives vahni, &c., will be\navoided. For special indications pointing in the same direction, which are\nfurnished by the passages which contain the words here treated of, I refer to\nBergaigne, Religion Vedique, II, 286 seq., and to the article of Dr. Neisser\nhimself, p. 321 seq.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. On the metrical irregularity, see above, verse 3, note 1.\n\nNote 2. Te seems to stand for the accusative, comp. Pischel, Zeitschrift der\nD. Morgenl. Gesellschaft, XXXV, 714 seq.; Delbruck, Altindische Syntax, 205.\nOr may the meaning be: and thy (worshippers) walk around thee \xe2\x80\xa6 like obedient\n(servants)?\'\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. On the metre, see above, verse 3, note 1. Prof. Max Muller translates,\n\'like a hunter for cattle.\'\n\nNote 2. The phrase vi _s_ vasu ksha\xc2\xb4su _g_ oguve occurs also, V, 64, 2. The\nsame hymn contains the word su- _k_ etuna, which is found in the eleventh\nverse of our hymn.\n\nNote 3. Literally, \'on all earths.\' Comp. X, 2, 6. n _ri_ vati _h_ anu ksha\xc2\xb4\n_h_.\n\nNote 4. _G_ arate, \'he wakes,\' at the same time can mean \'he sings,\' and \'he\nis praised.\' Comp. Neisser, Bezzenberger\'s Beitrage, X III, 298.\n\nNote 5. The translation \'dawn\' is conjectural only. But it gives a good\nmeaning in all the passages which contain the word _ri_ shu _n_ a\xc2\xb4m (besides\nour passage, V, 25, 1; VIII, 71, 15; X, 6, 1). Prof. Max Muller translates the\nlast two Padas: \'he sings like Rebha at the head of all singers, like a clever\nHot _ri_ among the singers.\'--Comp. Lanman, p. 424.\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. I supply suvi\xc2\xb4ryam; see the last Pada but one.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 128](sbe46037.htm)\n\n'
