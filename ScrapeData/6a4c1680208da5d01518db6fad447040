There were once three men, well-versed in udgitha 1, _S_ ilaka _S_\nalavatya, _K_ aikitayana, Dalbhya, and Pravaha _n_ a _G_ aivali. They said:\n'We are well-versed in udgitha. Let us have a discussion on udgitha.'\n\n2\\. They all agreed and sat down. Then Pravaha _n_ a _G_ aivali 2 said: 'Sirs,\ndo you both speak first,\n\np. 16\n\nfor I wish to hear what two Brahma _n_ as 1 have to say.\n\n3\\. Then _S_ ilaka _S_ alavatya said to _K_ aikitayana Dalbhya: 'Let me ask\nyou.'\n\n'Ask,' he replied.\n\n4\\. 'What is the origin of the Saman?' 'Tone (svara),' he replied.\n\n'What is the origin of tone?' 'Breath,' he replied.\n\n'What is the origin of breath?' 'Food,' he replied.\n\n'What is the origin of food?' 'Water,' he replied.\n\n5\\. 'What is the origin of water?' 'That world (heaven),' he replied.\n\n'And what is the origin of that world?'--\n\nHe replied: 'Let no man carry the Saman beyond the world of svarga (heaven).\nWe place (recognise) the Saman in the world of svarga, for the Saman is\nextolled as svarga (heaven).'\n\n6\\. Then said Silaka Salavatya to _K_ aikitayana Dalbhya: 'O Dalbhya, thy\nSaman is not firmly established. And if any one were to say, Your head shall\nfall off (if you be wrong), surely your head would now fall.'\n\n7\\. 'Well then, let me know this from you, Sir,' said Dalbhya.\n\n'Know it,' replied Silaka Salavatya.\n\n'What is the origin of that world (heaven)?' 'This world,' he replied.\n\n'And what is the origin of this world?'--\n\nHe replied: 'Let no man carry the Saman beyond this world as its rest. We\nplace the Saman\n\np. 17\n\nin this world as its rest, for the Saman is extolled as rest.'\n\n8\\. Then said Pravaha _n_ a _G_ aivali to _S_ ilaka _S_ alavatya: 'Your Saman\n(the earth), O _S_ alavatya, has an end. And if any one were to say, Your head\nshall fall off (if you be wrong), surely your head would now fall.'\n\n'Well then, let me know this from you, Sir,' said Salavatya.\n\n'Know it,' replied _G_ aivali.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[15:1](sbe01029.htm#fr_105) Cognisant of the deeper meanings of udgitha, i. e.\nOm.\n\n[15:2](sbe01029.htm#fr_106) He, though not being a Brahma _n_ a, turns out to\nbe the only one who knows the true meaning of udgitha, i. e. the Highest\nBrahman.\n\n[16:1](sbe01029.htm#fr_107) In V, 3, 5, Pravahana Gaivali is distinctly called\na ra _g_ anyabandhu.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 9](sbe01030.htm)\n\n"
