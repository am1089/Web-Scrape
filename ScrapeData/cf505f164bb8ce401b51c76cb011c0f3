At this time the women\nof Bruj said to one another, "By bathing in the month Aghun, the sins of every\nbirth are obliterated, and the hopes of the mind are accomplished. I have\nheard so from old people." On hearing this, they all resolved to bathe in\nAghun, that they might without doubt obtain Shree Krishnu. Having resolved\nupon this, and risen very early in the morning, the women of Bruj dressed and\nornamented themselves, and went in a body to bathe in the Jumna. Having bathed\nand made an offering to the sun, of eight ingredients, coming out of the\nwater, they made an earthen image of Parvutee. Putting sandal, rice, flowers\nand fruits upon it, placing before it perfumes, lamps and consecrated food,\nperforming poojah with hands joined, and holding their heads, they beseeched\nParvutee, saying "O Dewee! we constantly supplicate this boon from you, that\nShree Krishnu may be our lord." In this manner the cowherdesses constantly\nbathed. Fasting all day, they ate coagulated milk and rice in the evening, and\nslept on the ground at night. With a view of quickly obtaining the fruit of\ntheir fasting, all the women of Bruj went one day to a very steep ghaut to\nbathe; and on arrival, having taken off their clothes, and placed them\n\np. 76\n\non the bank, they went naked into the water. They began sporting about, and\nsinging the praises of Huri.\n\nShree Krishnu was also at this time pasturing cows, sitting under the shade of\na fig tree. Having heard by chance the sound of their singing, he came\nsilently to the spot, and having concealed himself began to look on. A sudden\nthought struck him, while he was looking on, and having stolen all their\nclothes, he climbed up a "kudum" tree, and placed them all in a bundle before\nhim. In the meantime, the cowherdesses looking on the bank for their clothes\ncould not find. them. Being alarmed, they got up and began searching all\nround, and saying to each other, "Not even a bird has come here; who can have\ntaken away our clothes?" Just then a cowherdess saw Krishnu sitting hid on a\n"kudum" tree, with a crown on his head, a club in his hand, marked with\nsaffron on the forehead, in a yellow silk dress, with a garland of flowers\nreaching to his feet, and preserving a strict silence, with a bundle of\nclothes before him. She called. out, "Behold him! who has stolen our hearts\nand our clothes, seated on a "kudum" tree with our bundles." Hearing this, and\nseeing Krishnu, all the women were ashamed, sitting down in the water, joining\ntheir hands and bending their heads, they supplicated and entreated. Krishnu,\nsaying "O compassionate to the poor! beloved destroyer of our griefs! O Mohan!\nplease give us our clothes." Krishnu replied, "By the oath of Nund, I will not\ngive then thus; come out of the water one by one, and you shall obtain your\nclothes."\n\nThe women of Bruj said angrily, "This is a pretty lesson you have learnt, in\ntelling us to come out of the water naked. We will go and tell this to your\nfather and brother, and they will come and lay hold of you as a thief. And we\nwill mention it also to Nund and Jusodha, who will teach you better. We are\nashamed at what you have done; you have put an end to all recognition\n(acquaintance) between us." On hearing this, Shree Krishnu Jee was enraged and\nsaid, "You shall\n\np. 77\n\nnot have the clothes until you come, and fetch them yourselves." The\ncowherdesses were alarmed and said, "O kind to the poor! it is you, who\nconstantly keep us in remembrance, and who are the guardian of our good name;\nhow shall we fetch them? It is for your sake, that we have offered up our\nvows, and bathed in the month of Mungsir." Krishnu replied, "If you have\nbathed with sincerity on my account in the month of Aghun, lay aside all\nbashfulness and deceit, and come and take your clothes." When Shree Krishnu\nChund had thus spoken, the cowherdesses on reflection began to say to each\nother, "Let us go friend! let us mind what Krishnu says, because he knows all\nthe secrets of our bodies and minds. Why should we be ashamed before him?"\nHaving thus determined, acting according to what Shree Krishnu had said, and\nconcealing their breasts and privities with their hands, all the women came\nout of the water, bowing their heads. When they stood opposite to Shree\nKrishnu on the bank, he said laughing, "Now put your hands together, and come\nforward, and I will give you your clothes." The cowherdesses said, "Darling of\nNund! why do you deceive us, we are plain, simple women of Bruj. We have been\ntricked, and all our mind and memory are gone. Is this the game you have\ndetermined upon playing, Huri? Whenever we think of this, we shall be\nashamed.; now do something for us, O lord of Bruj!" When they had thus spoken,\nand put their hands together, Shree Krishnu Chund Jee giving them their\nclothes, and approaching them said, "Be not displeased at what has happened,\nbecause this is a lesson I have given you. The habitation of the god Varoonu\nis in water: for this reason, if any one goes naked into the water, his\ncharacter is entirely destroyed. Having been delighted at beholding the\naffection of your mind, I have told you this secret, now go home, and return\nin the month of Kartik to dance the circular dance with me."\n\np. 78\n\nShree Shookdeo, the sage, said,--O great king! the cowherdesses having heard\nthis speech, returned to their homes, delighted and satisfied. And Shree\nKrishnu, having come to the fig tree, went along with the cowherds\' children\nand their companions and cows. Beholding on all sides jungle of various kinds,\nthey began to speak in high terms of trees, saying, "that after coming into\nthe world, they themselves suffered many troubles, and afforded pleasure to\nmankind. It is thus, that the coming into the world of those, who are\nattentive to the interests of others is beneficial." Conversing in this manner\nand advancing onward, they arrived near the Jumna.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXIV](psa25.htm)\n\n'
