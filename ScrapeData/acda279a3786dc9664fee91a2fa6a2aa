V.\n\nDivisions of the Yajur-veda. Story of Yajnawalkya: forced to give up what he\nhas learned: picked up by others, forming the Taittiriya-yajush. Yajnawalkya\nworships the sun, who communicates to him the Vajasneyi-yajush.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--Of the tree of the Yajur-veda there are twenty-seven branches,\nwhich Vai\xc5\x9bampayana, the pupil of Vyasa, compiled, and taught to as many\ndisciples 1. Amongst these, Yajnawalkya, the son of Brahmarata, was\ndistinguished for piety and obedience to his preceptor.\n\nIt had been formerly agreed by the Munis, that any one of them who, at a\ncertain time, did not join an assembly held on mount Meru should incur the\nguilt of killing a Brahman, within a period of seven nights 2. Vai\xc5\x9bampayana\nalone failed to keep the appointment, and consequently killed, by an\naccidental kick with his foot, the child of his sister. He then addressed his\nscholars, and desired them to perform the penance expiatory of Brahmanicide on\nhis behalf. Without any hesitation Yajnawalkya refused, and said, "How shall I\nengage in penance with these miserable and inefficient Brahmans?" On which his\nGuru, being incensed, commanded him to relinquish all that he had learnt from\nhim. "You speak contemptuously," he observed, "of these young Brahmans, but of\nwhat use is a disciple who disobeys my commands?" "I spoke," replied\nYajnawalkya, "in perfect faith; but as to what I have read from you, I have\nhad enough: it is no more than this--" (acting as if he would eject it from\nhis stomach); when he brought up the texts of the Yajush in substance stained\nwith blood. He then departed. The other scholars of Vai\xc5\x9bampayana, transforming\nthemselves to partridges (Tittiri), picked\n\np. 280\n\nup the texts which he had disgorged, and which from that circumstance were\ncalled Taittiriya 3; and the disciples were called the Charaka professors of\nthe Yajush, from Charan\xcc\x81a, \'going through\' or \'performing\' the expiatory rites\nenjoined by their master 4.\n\nYajnawalkya, who was perfect in ascetic practices, addressed himself\nstrenuously to the sun, being anxious to recover possession of the texts of\nthe Yajush. "Glory to the sun," he exclaimed, "the gate of liberation, the\nfountain of bright radiance, the triple source of splendour, as the Rig, the\nYajur, and the Sama Vedas. Glory to him, who, as fire and the moon, is one\nwith the cause of the universe: to the sun, that is charged with radiant heat,\nand with the Sushumna ray (by which the moon is fed with light): to him who is\none with the notion of time, and all its divisions of hours, minutes, and\nseconds: to him who is to be\n\np. 281\n\nmeditated upon as the visible form of Vishn\xcc\x81u, as the impersonation of the\nmystic Om: to him who nourishes the troops of the gods, having filled the moon\nwith his rays; who feeds the Pitris with nectar and ambrosia, and who\nnourishes mankind with rain; who pours down or absorbs the waters in the time\nof the rains, of cold, and of heat. Glory be to Brahma, the sun, in the form\nof the three seasons: he who alone is the dispeller of the darkness of this\nearth, of which he is the sovereign lord: to the god who is clad in the\nraiment of purity be adoration. Glory to the sun, until whose rising man is\nincapable of devout acts, and water does not purify, and touched by whose rays\nthe world is fitted for religious rites: to him who is the centre and source\nof purification. Glory to Savitri, to Surya, to Bhaskara, to Vivaswat, to\n\xc3\x81ditya, to the first-born of gods or demons. I adore the eye of the universe,\nborne in a golden car, whose banners scatter ambrosia."\n\nThus eulogized by Yajnawalkya, the sun, in the form of a horse, appeared to\nhim, and said, "Demand what you desire." To which the sage, having prostrated\nhimself before the lord of day, replied, "Give me a knowledge of those texts\nof the Yajush with which even my preceptor is unacquainted." Accordingly the\nsun imparted to him the texts of the Yajush called Ayatayama (unstudied),\nwhich were unknown to Vai\xc5\x9bampayana: and because these were revealed by the sun\nin the form of a horse, the Brahmans who study this portion of the Yajush are\ncalled Vajis (horses). Fifteen branches of this school sprang from Kan\xcc\x81wa and\nother pupils of Yajnawalkya 5.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[279:1](vp079.htm#fr_800) The Vayu divides these into three classes,\ncontaining each nine, and discriminated, northern, middle, and eastern. Of\nthese, the chiefs were severally \xc5\x9ayamayani, \xc3\x81run\xcc\x81i, and \xc3\x81nalavi, or \xc3\x81lambi.\nWith some inconsistency, however, the same authority states that Vai\xc5\x9bampayana\ncomposed and gave to his disciples eighty-six Sanhitas.\n\n[279:2](vp079.htm#fr_801) The parallel passage in the Vayu rather implies that\nthe agreement was to meet within seven nights.\n\n[280:3](vp079.htm#fr_802) Also called the black Yajush. No notice of this\nlegend, as Mr. Colebrooke observes (As. Iles. VIII. 376), occurs in the Veda\nitself; and the term Taittiriya is more rationally accounted for in the\nAnukraman\xcc\x81i or index of the black Yajush. It is there said that Vai\xc5\x9bampayana\ntaught it to Yaska, who taught it to Tittiri, who also became a teacher;\nwhence the term Taittiriya, for a grammatical rule explains it to mean, \'The\nTaittiriyas are those who read what was said or repeated by Tittiri.\' Pan\xcc\x81ini,\n4. 3. 102. The legend, then, appears to be nothing more than a Pauran\xcc\x81ik\ninvention, suggested by the equivocal sense of Tittiri, a proper name or a\npartridge. Much of the mythos of the Hindus, and obviously of that of the\nGreeks and Romans, originates in this source. It was not confined, at least\namongst the former, to the case that Creuzer specifies; "Telle ou telle\nexpression cessa d\'etre comprise, et l\'on inventa des mythes pour eclaircir\nces malentendus;" but was wilfully perpetrated, even where the word was\nunderstood, when it afforded a favourable opportunity for a fable. It may be\nsuspected in the present instance that the legend is posterior, not only to\nthe Veda, but to the grammatical rule, or it would have furnished Pan\xcc\x81ini with\na different etymology.\n\n[280:4](vp079.htm#fr_803) This is another specimen of the sort of Paronomasia\nexplained in the preceding note. The Charakas are the students of a \xc5\x9aakha, so\ndenominated from its teacher Charaka. (As. Res. VIII. 377.) So, again, Pan\xcc\x81ini\n4. 3. 107: \'The readers of that which is said by Charaka are Charakas:\'\nCharaka has no necessary connexion with Chara, \'to go.\' The Vayu states they\nwere also called Chat\xcc\x81akas, from Chat, \'to divide,\' because they shared\namongst them their master\'s guilt. \'Those pupils of Vai\xc5\x9bampayana were called\nChat\xcc\x81akas by whom the crime of Brahmanicide was shared; and Charakas from its\ndeparture.\'\n\n[281:5](vp079.htm#fr_804) The Vayu names the fifteen teachers of these\nschools, Kan\xcc\x81wa, Vaidheya, \xc5\x9aalin, Madhyandina, Sapeyin, Vidagdha, Uddalin,\nTamrayani, Vatsya, Galava, \xc5\x9aai\xc5\x9biri, \xc3\x81t\xcc\x81avya, Parn\xcc\x81a, Viran\xcc\x81a, and Samparayana,\nwho were the founders of no fewer than 101 branches of the Vajasaneyi, or\nwhite Yajush. Mr. Colebrooke specifies several of these, as the Jabalas,\nBaudhayanas, Tapaniyas, &c. As. Res. VIII. 376.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VI](vp080.htm)\n\n'
