My nieces twain  \nLet Bharat and S'atrughna gain,  \nAnd the four youths the selfsame day  \nFour maiden hands in theirs shall lay.  \nNo day so lucky may compare,  \nFor marriage--so the wise declare--  \nWith the last day of Phalguni  \nRuled by the genial deity.'  \nThen with raised hands in reverence due  \nTo those arch-saints he spoke anew:  \n'I am your pupil, ever true:  \nTo me high favour have ye shown;  \nCome, sit ye on my royal throne,  \nFor Das'aratha rules these towers  \nE'en as Ayodhya now is ours.  \nDo with your own whate'er ye choose:  \nYour lordship here will none refuse.'  \n\nHe spoke, and to Videha's king  \nThus Das'aratha, answering:  \n'Boundless your virtues, lords, wbose sway  \nThe realms of Mithila obey.  \nWith honouring care you entertain.  \nBoth holy sage and royal train.  \nNow to my house my steps I bend--  \nMay blessings still on you at end--  \nDue offerings to the shades to pay.'  \nThus spoke the king, and turned away:  \nTo Janak first he bade adieu,  \nThen followed fast those holy two.  \nThe monarch reached his palace where  \nThe rites were paid with solemn care.  \nWhen the next sun began to shine  \nHe rose and made his gift of kine.  \nA bundled thousand cows prepared  \nFor each young prince the Brahmans shared.  \nEach had her horns adorned with gold;  \nAnd duly was the number told,  \nFour hundred thousand perfect tale:  \nEach brought a calf, each filled a pail.  \nAnd when that glorious task was o'er,  \nThe monarch with his children four,  \nShowed like the Lord of Life divine  \nWhen the worlds' guardians round him shine.  \n\np. 84  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[83:1](ry071.htm#fr_252) The tenth of the lunar asterisms, composed of five\nstars.\n\n[83:2](ry071.htm#fr_253) 'There are two lunar asterisms of this name, one\nfollowing the other immediately, forming the eleventh and twelfth of the lunar\nmansions.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXXIII.: The Nuptials.](ry073.htm)\n\n"
