It was this\nhouse which the Bhagavan chose to make His chief "vineyard" on that day. Here\nHe had bound devotee after devotee by the tie of Divine Love. It was here that\nHe had so often sung the Name of the Lord and danced at the head of His\ndisciples. It seemed as if another Gouranga \xe2\x80\xa0 had set up in the house of His\ndisciple Srivash a fair for the "buying and selling of Divine Love."\n\nHow great was the Master\'s love for His disciples! There in the Temple of Kali\nalone by\n\np. 348\n\n[paragraph continues] Himself He often cried like a child, He so longed to see\nthem. Sleepless at night He would say to the Divine Mother: "O Mother! Deign\nto draw them into the fold! They are so devoted to Thee! Oh, how I long to see\nthem! Mother, bring them to me or take me to them." Was this the secret of His\ncoming to Balaram\'s house so frequently? He declared, indeed, to everyone:\n"Balaram is a true Bhakta, he daily worships the Lord of the universe. His\nofferings are therefore always acceptable." But whenever He came to His house,\nHe would say: "Go and invite my Narendra and other disciples. Offering food to\nthem is the same as offering it to God Himself. These, indeed, are not\nordinary men. They are parts of Divinity manifest in the flesh." And many a\ntime had the devotees met there "at the Durbar of God\'s love."\n\nMahendra, * who taught in a neighboring school, had heard that Sri Ramakrishna\nwas visiting at Balaram\'s house, so having a little leisure he came about noon\nto see Him. The mid-day dinner was over and the Bhagavan was in the drawing-\nroom resting. His young disciples\n\np. 349\n\nwere seated round Him. From time to time He was taking out spices from a small\npouch. Mahendra, entering, bowed down and saluted His feet.\n\nSri Ramakrishna (affectionately): Mahendra! You here! Is there no school to-\nday?\n\nMahendra: I have come directly from school. I had just now nothing of\nimportance to attend to there.\n\nA devotee: No, Revered Sir, he is playing the truant.\n\nMahendra (to himself): Ah me! It is as if some Invisible Force had drawn me to\nthis place.\n\nThe Bhagavan then grew more serious and bade them take their seats. He said:\nFor some time past I have not been able to touch any metal. Can you tell me\nwhy it is? Once when I put my hand on a metal cup, it was hurt as if stung by\na horned fish and the pain lasted for a long while. I had to use a metal\npitcher and I thought that I should be able to carry it by covering it with a\ntowel; but no sooner did I touch it than I had excruciating pain in my hand.\nThen I prayed to my Divine Mother: "O Mother! I shall never touch metal again.\nDo Thou forgive me this time."\n\np. 350\n\nii\n\nIn the afternoon Sri Ramakrishna was still seated in Balaram\'s drawing-room.\nOn His face was a sweet smile, the reflection of which was caught by the faces\nof the disciples. Girish Ghosh, * Suresh Mittra, \xe2\x80\xa0 Balaram, Latoo, \xe2\x80\xa1 Chunilall\n\xc2\xa7 and many other disciples were present.\n\nRamakrishna (to Girish): You would better argue the point with Narendra\n(Vivekananda) and see what he has to say.\n\nGirish: Narendra says: "God is Infinite.\n\np. 351\n\n[paragraph continues] We cannot even say that all that we hear or see--be it\nan object or a person--is a part of God. Infinity is one; how can it have\nparts? It cannot be divided."\n\nDivine Incarnation.Ramakrishna: God may be Infinite or even greater than\nInfinite; but by His omnipotent will He can manifest His essence through human\nform and incarnate Himself among us. Indeed He does incarnate Himself as a\nhuman being. How He incarnates we cannot explain by words. One must feel it\nand realize it. By analogy we can get only a faint idea of it. For instance,\nif you have touched the horn, leg or udder of a cow, have you not touched the\nwhole cow? But for us human beings the milk is the most important thing and\nthat you can get only from the udder, not from any other part of the body. The\nIncarnation of God is like the udder, through which flows the milk of Divine\nLove. In order to give mankind His essence of Divine Love and Bhakti the Lord\nincarnates from time to time in a human form.\n\nGirish: Narendra says: "Is it possible to fully comprehend God? He is\nInfinite."\n\nRamakrishna: That is true. Who can fully comprehend God or even any of His\nattributes,\n\np. 352\n\ngreat or small? Why is it necessary for us to know all His attributes? It is\nenough if we can see Him and realize Him. Moreover, he who has seen His Divine\nIncarnation has seen God. Suppose a man goes to the banks of the holy river\nGanges and touches the water. He will say: "I have seen and touched the holy\nriver." It will not be necessary for him to touch the whole river from its\nsource to its mouth. If I touch your feet, then I have touched you. If you go\nto the ocean and touch the water, you have touched the whole ocean. As fire is\nall-pervading but is more manifest in burning wood, so God, although He is\nall-pervading, is more manifest in His Incarnation.\n\nGirish (smiling). I, for my part, am searching after fire. I am eagerly\nlooking for the place where I shall find it.\n\nSeek God in Man.Ramakrishna (smiling): The element fire is more manifest in\nthe wood. If you seek the Divine element, you must seek it in man, for\nDivinity is more manifest in a human being than elsewhere. Again, if you see a\nman who is overflowing with Divine Love, who is mad after God, who is\nintoxicated by the wine of Divine Love, in that man you must know, I assure\nyou, that the Lord has\n\np. 353\n\nmanifested Himself. It is true that God dwells everywhere, but His Divine\npower (Sakti) is more manifest in some places than in others. In the Avatara\n(God-Incarnate) the manifestation of Sakti is very great. Sometimes the\nmanifestation of this Divine power is complete and perfect. In fact Avatara\nmeans the incarnation of Sakti, the Divine Power.\n\nGirish: Narendra says: "He is beyond the reach of mind, words and senses."\n\nRamakrishna: No, He is beyond the reach of impure mind only, but not of the\npurified mind (Manas). He cannot be apprehended by ordinary intellect, but\npurified intellect (Buddhi) can comprehend Him. Mind and intellect become\npurified when they are absolutely free from attachment to lust and wealth\n(Kamini and Kanchan). Then purified mind and purified intellect become one.\nIndeed God can be realized by the purified mind. Is it not true that the sages\nand saints have realized Him? They realized the Supreme Spirit in the Self by\ntheir true Self.\n\nGirish (smiling): Narendra has been defeated by me in the discussion!\n\nRamakrishna: Oh no! On the contrary he says: "Girish has such firm faith in\nthe Avatara\n\np. 354\n\nin a human form that I feel that I should say nothing against it."\n\nThe Bhagavan then expressed a desire to listen to the chanting of hymns.\nBalaram\'s drawing-room was filled with visitors. Everyone watched the\nBhagavan, eager to hear what fell from His lips and to mark what He would do\nnext. Tarapada was invited to sing, and sang a song describing the sports of\nthe Shepherd of men, Sri Krishna.\n\nSuresh Mittra, another disciple, was seated at some distance from the\nBhagavan. Sri Ramakrishna smiled on him affectionately and pointing to Girish,\nsaid to him: Do you talk of the wild life that you did live at one time? Here\nis one very much more than your match.\n\nSuresh (laughing): That is indeed true, Revered Sir. He is my Dada (respected\nelder brother) in this regard.\n\nGirish (to the Bhagavan): I never paid attention to my studies in my boyhood.\nHow is it, Revered Sir, that people insist on calling me learned?\n\nRamakrishna: Do you know what I think about learning and the reading of the\nScriptures? Books and Sacred Scriptures all point the way to God. Once you\nknow the way, what\n\np. 355\n\nScriptures and realization.is the use of books? Now the time comes for\ndevotional practices in solitude. A person had received a letter in which he\nwas asked to send certain articles to his kinsmen. He was about to order the\npurchase of those things, when, looking for the letter, he found it was\nmissing. He searched for a long time. His people also joined him in his\nsearch. At last the letter was found and his joy knew no bounds. With great\neagerness he took it up and went through its contents. But after knowing what\nthings were wanted, he threw the letter aside and set forth to collect the\ndesired articles. How long does one care for such a letter? So long as one\ndoes not know its contents. The next step is to put forth one\'s effort to\nprocure the things. Similarly the Sacred Books only tell us the means for the\nrealization of God. Having once known them, you should struggle hard to\nacquire them and reach the goal. What is the use of mere book-learning? A\npandit may know many sacred texts and sciences, but if his mind is attached to\nthe world, if he enjoys the pleasures of the senses, he has not realized the\nspirit of the Scriptures; he has studied them in vain.\n\nRamakrishna then said to Girish: Narendra\n\np. 356\n\nis a young man of very high order. He is interested in everything,--singing,\nplaying on musical instruments, on the one hand, and in the study of the\nvarious branches of knowledge on the other. He possesses the virtues of self-\nmastery, right discrimination, dispassion and many other qualities. (Aside to\na disciple) Just look at Girish\'s devotion to the Lord and his faith in Him.\n\nNaran, * to the Bhagavan: Revered Sir, shall we not have the pleasure of\nhearing Thee sing?\n\nUpon this the Bhagavan chanted the Name of the Divine Mother of the universe.\n\nSong\n\nThe Beloved Mother of the Universe\n\n1\\. O my soul, do thou clasp to thy heart my beloved Mother,  \nLet thee and me alone have the pleasure of looking on Her;  \nLet Her be seen by none else, by none else!\n\n2\\. Desires--Oh, get out of their way, my soul; let us enjoy Her presence\nalone.  \nOnly let us have the tongue for our sole companion to cry out to Her, saying,\n"Mother, Mother!"\n\np. 357\n\n3\\. There are evil desires, there are those which point to us the path leading\nto worldliness; Oh! Do not let them come near us!  \nLet the eye of wisdom that leads Godward keep watch, and guard us from evil.\n\nThe Bhagavan then sang another song in which He placed Himself in the position\nof the weary and heavy-laden men of the world, bending under the weight of\ntheir trials and sufferings:\n\nSong\n\nThe Mother And Her Weary Children\n\n1\\. O Mother! Thou art made of Bliss Ever-lasting, why then is it denied unto\nme?\n\n2\\. My soul, O Good Mother, knows not anything but the Lotus of Thy Hallowed\nFeet.  \nWhy then does the Ruler of Death, the King of Justice, find fault with me?\nTell me what answer to make to that dreaded King.\n\n3\\. It was my heart\'s wish, O Mother, to repeat Thy Sacred Name and cross the\nocean of death. Not even in my dream had I the least idea that I should be\ndrowned by Thee in the shoreless ocean.\n\np. 358\n\n4\\. Day and night, O Mother, Thou Consort of Eternity, have I been repeating\nThy Sacred Name, which brings salvation unto Thy weary children. But alas! my\nendless troubles will never leave me. I only regret that if I am not saved, no\none else will ever repeat Thy Name.\n\nThe Bhagavan next sang about the joy of the Divine Mother:\n\nSong\n\nThe Great Mystery\n\nWith Shiva the Mother plays always, absorbed in blissful joy.  \nDeep drunk She is, but falls not.\n\nShe dances on the breast of Her consort,  \nThe world quakes under the weight of Her feet.  \nBoth have reached the climax of madness;  \nBoth are fearless and free.\n\nThe disciples listened to the songs in deep silence. What struck them was the\nchange that had come over the Bhagavan. He was beside Himself with the joy of\nthe Lord--intoxicated with that unbounded Bliss.\n\nTwilight had fallen. The disciples would not\n\np. 359\n\nleave their seats. With heads upraised and eager ears they listened to the\nsweet Name of the Lord chanted by the Bhagavan, sweeter as repeated by Him\nthan by any whom they had ever heard before. Yes, they had never heard another\nchild calling out so sweetly to its mother, saying, "Mother, Mother!" It\nseemed as if drops of nectar fell from the lips of the Bhagavan. The infinite\nsky, the heaven-kissing mountain, the deep blue ocean, the boundless expanse,\nthe deep dense wilderness--what was the use now of going to them in quest of\nthe Divine Father and Mother of the universe? What was the use of fixing one\'s\nattention on the "cow\'s horn" or her feet or any other part of her body? The\nMaster had spoken to-day of the udder of the cow from which to draw the milk\nof Divine Love. Was it indeed given to those present to behold the vision of\nGod-Incarnate in that very room? What else could have brought into the hearts\nof the disciples--of those that were weary and heavy-laden--the perfect peace\nand the joy that are of the Lord? What else could have made this vale of tears\noverflow with joy? Was it possible that the Man before them was God-Incarnate?\nWhether He was or not their minds and hearts\n\np. 360\n\nand souls were His own to deal with just as He pleased! He was already to them\nthe Polestar of this enigmatical life. It was for them now to watch how in His\ngreat Saul the Supreme Being, the Cause of causes, was reflected. Thus did\nsome of the disciples think within themselves. They felt that they were truly\nblessed as they heard the Bhagavan chant the Name of the Divine Mother and of\nHari, the Lord God who taketh away all trouble, all sin and iniquity.\n\nThe chanting of the Names being over, the Bhagavan prayed to the Mother. It\nseemed as if the God of Love had taken a human form in order to teach man how\nto pray. He said:\n\nPrayer to the Divine mother.Mother, I throw myself upon Thy mercy. May the\nLotus of Thy Feet ever keep me from whatever leadeth Thy children away from\nThee! I seek not, good Mother, the pleasures of .the senses; I seek not fame.\nNor do I long for those Siddhis (Yoga powers) which enable one to perform\nmiracles. What I pray for, O Good Mother, is pure love for Thee, love\nuntainted by desires, love without alloy, love which seeketh not the things of\nthis world, love for Thee that welleth up unbidden from the depths of the\nimmortal soul. Grant likewise,\n\np. 361\n\n[paragraph continues] O Mother, that Thy child, bewitched by the fascinations\nof Thy enchanting powers (Maya) may not forget Thee; yes, forget Thee,\nentangled in the charming net of Samsara that Thou hast woven. O, grant that\nhe may never be charmed into loving these! O Good Mother, seest Thou not that\nThy child hath none else in the world but Thee? I know not how to chant Thy\nName out of deep devotion. Devoid am I of knowledge that leadeth to Thee--\ndevoid of genuine love (Bhakti) for Thee! O, vouchsafe unto me that love out\nof Thine Infinite Mercy!\n\nThis evening prayer--was it called for in the case of this God-Man, for Him\nwho chanted the Name of the Lord day and night, for Him out of whose hallowed\nmouth there flowed a never-ceasing stream of prayers unto the Most High? Was\nit then that the Master observed these forms in order to teach mankind how to\nlive and pray?\n\niii\n\nGirish had invited Sri Ramakrishna to his house. He must come that very night.\nThe Bhagavan said to him: Do you not think it will be too late?\n\nGirish: No, Revered Sir; Thou shalt come away as early as Thou pleasest.\n\np. 362\n\nIt was about nine in the evening. Balaram had made his offerings ready for Sri\nRamakrishna\'s supper. The gracious Bhagavan would not wound his feelings. He\nsaid to Balaram: "Send over to Girish\'s house the food that you have prepared\nfor me." Saying this, He set out, followed by His disciples. Going downstairs\nfrom the first floor, He became like another being; He looked as if He was\nlost in the thought of God--as if He had drunk deep! It seemed as if sense-\nconsciousness was beginning to leave Him. A disciple went forward to hold Him\nby the hand, lest He should miss His footing. The Bhagavan said to him with\ngreat tenderness: "If you hold me by the hand, people will say, \'He is a\ndrunkard.\' Let me walk alone without any help." He crossed the next turning\njust a little way from Girish\'s house. What made Him walk so fast? The\ndisciples were left behind. No one knew what Divine idea had found its way\ninto His heart. What made Him walk like a madman? Was it because He was\nthinking of that Being who in the Vedanta is said to be beyond the reach of\nword and thought?\n\nHere was Narendra coming! Many a day had the Bhagavan cried, calling\n"Narendra,\n\np. 363\n\n[paragraph continues] Ramakrishna\'s ecstasy.Narendra," like one gone mad. But\nnow Narendra was there before Him and yet He exchanged no word with him. Was\nthis what people called Bhava (ecstasy), a state into which Chaitanya is said\nto have been constantly thrown? Who was there to penetrate the mystery of this\nDivine ecstasy?\n\nSri Ramakrishna had come to the end of the lane leading to Girish\'s house. The\ndisciples were all following. He now spoke to Narendra, saying: "Is it well\nwith you, my child? I had not the power then to talk to you." Every word that\nfell from His lips was marked by tenderness. He had not as yet come to the\ndoor of the house, but all at once He stopped short. He looked at Narendra and\nsaid: "This is one of the two,--the human soul, and the other is the cosmos."\nWas He indeed looking at the soul and the world? If so, in what light? He was\ngazing on Indescribable Brahman! One or two words had dropped from His\nhallowed lips, like some solemn texts from inspired Scriptures. Or was it that\nHe had gone to the edge of the Infinite Ocean and stood there speechless,\nlooking on the Boundless Expanse, and had heard one or two echoes\nreverberating\n\np. 364\n\nfrom the never-ceasing voice that comes up from the Eternal Deep?\n\niv\n\nGirish stood at the door of his house. He had come to receive the Bhagavan.\nSri Ramakrishna came up with His disciples. At the blessed sight Girish fell\nat His feet prostrate. The sight was indeed a blessed one and the disciples\nlooked on with awe and admiration. Girish received on his head the dust of His\nhallowed feet and rose at the Master\'s bidding. He led the way to the drawing-\nroom, where the Bhagavan and His disciples took their seats. They longed to\ndrink the nectar of His words which brought everlasting life.\n\nHe was about to take His seat when He found a newspaper lying by His side. As\nnewspapers had to do with worldly-minded men, with worldly matters, with\ngossip and scandal, they were unholy objects in His eyes. He made a sign and\nthe paper was put away. Thereupon He took His seat. Nityagopal * bowed down\nand saluted His feet.\n\np. 365\n\nBhagavan (to Nitya): Well! and why did you not go there?\n\nNitya: Revered Sir, I was unable to go to Dakshineswara. I was out of sorts.\nThere were pains all over my body.\n\nBhagavan: Are you keeping well now?\n\nNitya: Not very well, I am sorry to say.\n\nBhagavan: You would better remain one or two notes below the highest in the\nscale.\n\nNitya: Company does not suit me. They say all manner of things of me. That\nputs me into a fright. At times I am quite free from fear and I feel the\nspirit within me.\n\nBhagavan: That is only natural. Who is your constant companion?\n\nNitya: Tarak. At times he does not suit the state of my mind.\n\nBhagavan: Nangta * (Tota Puri) used to say\n\np. 366\n\nthat they had at their Math a Siddha who had acquired some miraculous powers.\nHe used to go about with his eyes fixed on the sky, not caring for his\ncompanion Ganesh Gorgy, yet when he left him, he became disconsolate.\n\nBy this time a change had come over the Bhagavan. He remained speechless for a\nwhile Returning to consciousness, he said: "You have come, have you? Well, I\nam here too." Who was there to fathom the mystery of these divine words!\n\np. 367\n\nv\n\nAmong the disciples who sat at the feet of Ramakrishna, Narendra did not\nbelieve in the Incarnation of God, while Girish had a burning faith that God\nincarnated Himself from age to age in this world of ours. The Bhagavan wished\nthem to discuss the matter before Him.\n\nSri Ramakrishna (to Girish): I should like to hear you both talk over the\nmatter in English.\n\nThe discussion was commenced. It was, however, carried on not in English but\nin Bengali, with here and there an English word.\n\nGod manifest.Narendra: God is Infinite; it is beyond our power to conceive Him\nby means of our poor intellect. God is in every human being, but He is not\nmanifest in one particular individual.\n\nThe Bhagavan (affectionately): I quite concur. He is in every object, in every\nhuman being; only there is a difference in the manifestation of Divine Energy\nin those objects. The Divine Energy manifest in some objects leads one away\nfrom God and is then called Avidya (ignorance). When it leads Godward it is\ncalled Vidya. Again, the manifested\n\np. 368\n\nenergy is greater in some vessels and less in, others. Thus it is that all men\nare not equal.\n\nA disciple: What is the use of all this idle talk?\n\nBhagavan: There is a great deal of use in it.\n\nGirish (to Narendra): How do you know that God does not take a human body,\ndoes not incarnate Himself?\n\nNarendra: Oh! God is surely beyond the reach of words and the finite mind!\n\nGod realized by purified soul.Ramakrishna: Quite so; beyond the finite impure\nmind. But He can be realized by the purified intellect (Buddhi). Purified=\nintellect and purified soul are one The holy sages (Rishis) realized the pure\nuniversal Spirit by their purified intellect and purified soul.\n\nGirish (to Narendra): If God does not incarnate Himself in a human form, who\nwill explain these difficult problems? He assumes human form to teach mankind\nDivine Wisdom and Divine Love. Who else has the power to teach in the same\nmanner?\n\nNarendra. Why, He will certainly teach me within the heart.\n\np. 369\n\nBhagavan (affectionately): That is indeed so. He will teach as internal Ruler\nof the heart (Antaryamin).\n\nThe discussion grew warm. It turned on matters too high for ordinary\ncomprehension: Was Infinity indivisible? What did Hamilton say as to the limit\nof human knowledge; and Herbert Spencer, Tyndall and Huxley?\n\nRamakrishna: I for my part do not like these things. God is beyond the power\nof reasoning; He is something more. I see that whatever is, is God. What then\nis the necessity of reasoning about Him? I do actually see that whatever is,\nis God. It is He who has become all these things. This is a stage at which the\nmind and the intellect (Buddhi) are lost in the Absolute and Indivisible\nBeing. At the sight of Narendra my mind becomes merged in the Indivisible\nAbsolute. What, pray, do you say to this?\n\nGirish (smiling): Surely, Revered Sir, we do not pretend that we understand\neverything except this.\n\nRamakrishna: Thereupon at the end of Samadhi I must come down two notes at\nleast below the highest note in the scale before I can utter a word. Vedanta\nhas been explained by\n\np. 370\n\n[paragraph continues] Sankara. * Another point of view is that of Ramanuja, \xe2\x80\xa0\nwho has put forward the doctrine of qualified non-dualism.\n\nNarendra (to the Bhagavan): Sir, may I ask what is meant by Visishtadvaitavada\n(qualified. non-dualism)?\n\nQualified non-dualism.Ramakrishna: There is a doctrine called\nVisishtadvaitavada, the view of Ramanuja; that is, the Absolute (Brahman) must\nnot be considered apart from the world and the soul. The three form one: three\nin one and one in three. Let us take a Bel-fruit. Let the shell, the seeds and\nthe kernel be kept separate. Now suppose some one wished to know the weight of\nthe fruit. Surely\n\np. 371\n\nit would not do to weigh the kernel alone. The shell, the seeds and the kernel\nare all weighed with a view to knowing the real weight of the fruit. No doubt\nwe reason at the outset that the all-important thing is the kernel--not either\nthe shell or the seeds. In the next place, we go on reasoning that the shell\nand the seeds belong to the same substance to which the kernel belongs. At the\nfirst stage of the reasoning we say, "Not this, not this." Thus the Absolute\n(Brahman) is not the individual soul. Again, it is not the phenomenal world.\nThe Absolute (Brahman) is the only Reality, all else is unreal. At the next\nstage we go a little farther. We see that the kernel belongs to the same\nsubstance as that to which the shell and the seeds belong; hence the Substance\nfrom which we derive our negative conception of the Absolute Brahman is the\nidentical Substance from which we derive our negative conceptions of the\nfinite soul and the phenomenal world. Our relative phenomena (Lila) must be\ntraced to that eternal Being which is also called the Absolute. Hence, says\nRamanuja, the Absolute (Brahman) is qualified by the finite soul and the\nphenomenal world. This is the doctrine of the qualified non-dualistic Vedanta.\n\np. 372\n\nSpiritual awakening necessary to see the Reality.I see that Being as a Reality\nbefore my very eyes! Why should I reason? I do actually see that the Absolute\nhas become all things about us. It appears as the individual soul and the\nphenomenal see the Reality. world. One must have an awakening of the spirit\nwithin to How long must one reason and discriminate, saying, "Not this, not\nthis"? So long as one has not realized the Absolute Reality. It is not in mere\nwords such as "I see that God has become everything"; mere saying is not\nenough. By the Lord\'s Grace the spirit must be quickened. Spiritual awakening\nis followed by Samadhi. In this state one forgets that one has a body; one\nloses all attachment to things of this world; one likes no other words than\nthose relating to God; one is sorely troubled if called upon to listen to\nworldly matters. The spirit within being awakened, the next step is the\nrealization of the Universal Spirit. It is the spirit that can realize the\nSpirit.\n\nAfter the discussion was over the Bhagavan said. I have observed that\ndiscrimination brings only intellectual apprehension of the Absolute, which is\nfar from true realization. The latter can be acquired by meditation in\nsolitude\n\np. 373\n\n[paragraph continues] Intellectual apprehension and realization.(Dhyana); but\nit is very different from realization through His Grace. If He, out of His\nGrace, makes us realize what is God-Incarnate and how He manifests through a\nhuman form, then it is no longer necessary to reason or explain. Do you know\nhow it is? As in a dark room someone rubs a match on the side of the box and\nall at once a light is struck. So, if the Lord is gracious enough to strike\nthe light for us, the darkness of ignorance will be dispelled and all doubts\nwill cease forever. Can He be realized by such discussions?\n\nThe Bhagavan then invited Narendra to be seated by His side. He made many\nloving inquiries about him and caressed him.\n\nNarendra: Why, Revered Sir, I have meditated in solitude on the Divine Mother\nfor three and four days together, but nothing has come of it.\n\nBhagavan: All in time; do not be impatient. Mother is no other than Brahman\nthe Absolute. Divine Mother is the primeval energy, when that is without\nactivity I call it Brahman. But when it creates, preserves and destroys the\nphenomenal world I call it Sakti (energy), or\n\np. 374\n\n[paragraph continues] Divine Mother. That which you call Brahman is the same\nas my Divine Mother. (To Girish) It is getting late.\n\nGirish: I am afraid I shall have to leave Thee, Revered Sir, and go to my\nwork, unfortunate that I am!\n\nBhagavan: No, you must serve both parties. Janaka served God unattached to the\nworld and thus looked to the interests of both this world and the next; he\ndrank the cup of milk but did not forget the soul.\n\nGirish: I am thinking, Revered Sir, of giving up my profession.\n\nBhagavan: No, no; you need not do any such thing. It is all right as it is.\nYou are doing good to many.\n\nNarendra (softly): Just a moment ago he was addressing Him as Lord, God-\nIncarnate, yet he still has such strong attachment to his professional work.\n\nThe Bhagavan had Narendra seated by his side. He fixed His eyes on him. He\nmoved down to sit closer to him. Narendra did not believe that God incarnated\nHimself, but what did that signify? His love for him was still as great as\never. Touching his person the Bhagavan said to him: Are your feelings wounded?\n\np. 375\n\n[paragraph continues] Never mind; we, too, are of the same mind with you and\nfeel for you.\n\nDisputations prevent realization of God.Bhagavan continued: So long as one\nreasons and argues about God, one has not realized Him. You both were engaged\nin discussion. I did not like it. How long does the noise continue at a feast\nto which many are bidden? So long as the guests have not begun to eat. As soon\nas the viands are served and they begin to partake of them, three-fourths of\nthe noise is gone. Then the more the sweetmeats are passed around, the more\nthe noise subsides. The nearer you come to God, the less you are disposed to\nargue. When you come up to Him, when you behold Him as the Reality, then all\nnoise, all disputations are at an end. Then is the time for the enjoyment\nwhich comes in _Sam adhi_.\n\nSaying this, the Bhagavan gently moved His and over Narendra\'s sweet face and\ncaressed him, repeating, "Hari Om, Hari Om, Hari Om."\n\nThen what a miracle passed before the eyes of the disciples! Looking at the\nBhagavan, they saw His sense-consciousness beginning to leave Him. Looking\nagain, they saw that it had left Him altogether. In this half-conscious state\nthe hand of the Incarnation of Divine\n\np. 376\n\n[paragraph continues] Love continued to rest on Narendra\'s body. Was He\nbreathing into him the inspiration, the power that comes from above? Then yet\nother changes came over the Bhagavan. He said to Narendra, with folded hands:\nA song do sing, then I shall get well; how else shall I be able to stand on my\nfeet. "My Nitai! Oh! He is deep drunk, intoxicated with the wine of Divine\nLove, the love for Gouranga (God-Incarnate)."\n\nA short while and He was speechless again, speechless like a figure cut in\nmarble. Drunk with the joy of the Lord, the Bhagavan went on, saying: "Take\ncare of Radha, lest thou fall into the Jamuna. O thou, mad with ecstatic love\nfor Him who incarnated Himself at Brindavan, the Lord Sri Krishna!" Once more\nHe was in deep _Sam adhi!_ Coming back into sense-consciousness he repeated\nportions of a well-known song: "O my friend, how far is that blessed woodland,\nthe land where is to be seen my own Beloved One? Look! Here comes the\nfragrance from the blessed person of my Beloved! I am unable to take a step\nforward, O my friend!"\n\nNow the Bhagavan had lost all consciousness of the world. He was not mindful\nof anything\n\np. 377\n\nor any person in this state. Narendra was seated before Him, but apparently He\ndid not see him. He had lost all sense of time and place. The mind, the heart\nand the soul had all become absorbed in God. Suddenly He stood up, saying:\n"Deep drunk with the wine of Divine Love, with love for Gour (God-Incarnate)."\nA few moments after He took His seat and said: "Yonder is a light coming this\nway, but I cannot even now say from which way the light comes." It was then\nthat Narendra began to sing:\n\nGod-Vision\n\n1\\. O Lord! Thou hast blessed me with Thy vision and Thou hast driven all my\ntroubles away.  \nA charm Thou hast thrown over my soul.\n\n2\\. Beholding Thee as the Reality, the seven worlds have forgotten their\ngrief!  \nNot to speak of my poor self, so worthy of Thy pity and Thy loving-kindness!\n\nListening to the song the Bhagavan had once more lost all consciousness of the\nouter world. His eyes were closed. His body and limbs moved not He was in deep\n_Sam adhi_. When\n\np. 378\n\nthe _Sam adhi_ was over he asked: "Who will take me home to the temple?" A\nchild looking for a companion! Left alone, he saw nothing but darkness about.\nIt was getting late and it was the night of the tenth day of the dark\nfortnight. Sri Ramakrishna wished to go back to the Temple at Dakshineswara.\nHe seated Himself in the carriage which was to take Him there. The disciples\nstood on either side of the carriage to see Him off. Even now was He deep\ndrunk with the joy of the Lord! The carriage rolled away. The disciples looked\nafter it for a few moments, then dispersed each to his own home.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[347:*](gork15.htm#fr_87) See note [p. 140](gork07.htm#page_140).\n\n[347:\xe2\x80\xa0](gork15.htm#fr_88) See note [p. 7](gork03.htm#page_7).\n\n[348:*](gork15.htm#fr_89) See note page [33](gork04.htm#page_33).\n\n[350:*](gork15.htm#fr_90) Girish Chunder Ghosh, the greatest Hindu poet,\ndramatist and actor of modern India.

He\nreached the highest state of _Nirvikalpa Sam adhi_ p. 366 after practising for\nforty years. He used to travel from place to place in India, never spending\nmore than three days in one spot. When he came to Dakshineswara he lived under\nthe trees at the Panchavati and wore no clothes. After seeing Ramakrishna he\ndesired to instruct Him in Advaita Vedanta. Ramakrishna like a child replied.\n"I shall ask my Divine Mother, and if She gives me Her permission I shall\nlearn of you." The sage Tota Puri was pleased with His answer. He then stayed\nwith Ramakrishna for eleven months, which was quite unusual for him to do. He\ngave Him instructions on the oneness of the Jiva with Brahman, and within\nthree days Ramakrishna realized that supreme oneness by reaching the\nNirvikalpa Samadhi.
