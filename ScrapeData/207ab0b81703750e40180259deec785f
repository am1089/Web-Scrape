Earth on account of the subject-matter, the colour, and other texts.\n\nThat the word 'food' denotes the earth is to be inferred from the fact that\nthe section in which the word occurs has for its subject-matter the creation\nof the elements; as everything eatable is a product of the earth, the term\ndenoting the effect is there applied to denote the cause. In the same chapter,\nwhere the colour of the elements is mentioned ('The red colour of a flame is\nthe colour of fire, the white one that of water, the black one that of food\n'), the collocation of words clearly shows that 'food' means something of the\nsame kind as fire and water, viz. the elements of earth. And there are other\ntexts also which treat of the same topic and declare the origination of earth\nfrom water, cp. Taitt. Up. II, 1, 'from fire sprang water, from water earth.'\nAll this proves that the term 'food' denotes earth, and that hence earth\noriginates from water.\n\nFire and the other substances, the origination of which has been detailed, are\nmentioned merely as instances, and it must be understood that also other\nentities, such as the 'Mahat,' and so on, originate only from the immediately\npreceding cause, in agreement with scriptural statements. And texts such as\n'From him is born breath, mind, and all organs of sense, ether, air, light,\nwater, and the earth, the support of all' (Mu. Up. II, 1, 3); 'From him is\nborn that\n\np. 537\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahman, name, form, and food' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 9); 'From\nthat Self there sprang ether' (Taitt. Up. II, 1, 1); 'It (i.e. that which is)\nsent forth fire' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 2, 3)--(which seems to teach the direct\norigination from Brahman of the different elements, and so on)--may be\ninterpreted on the understanding of Brahman being their mediate cause also.--\nThis prima facie view the next Sutra disposes of.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 14.
