And on account of the permanent existence (of activity or non-activity).\n\nMoreover, the atoms would have to be assumed as either\n\np. 391\n\nessentially active (moving) or essentially non-active, or both or neither;\nthere being no fifth alternative. But none of the four alternatives stated is\npossible. If they were essentially active, their activity would be permanent\nso that no pralaya could take place. If they were essentially non-active,\ntheir non-activity would be permanent, and no creation could take place. Their\nbeing both is impossible because self-contradictory. If they were neither,\ntheir activity and non-activity would have to depend on an operative cause,\nand then the operative causes such as the ad _ri_ sh _t_ a being in permanent\nproximity to the atoms, permanent activity would result; or else the ad _ri_\nsh _t_ a and so on not being taken as operative causes, the consequence would\nbe permanent non-activity on the part of the atoms.--For this reason also the\natomic doctrine is untenable.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 15](sbe34191.htm)\n\n'
