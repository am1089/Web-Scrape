Thee, O Agni, the highest king of human\ntribes, the god, thoughtful mortals kindle at their worship.\n\n2\\. Thee, O Agni, the _Ri_ tvig, the Hot _ri_ , they magnify at the\nsacrifices. Shine as the guardian of _Ri_ ta in thy own house\n[1](sbe46070.htm#an_3:10:2:1).\n\n3\\. He indeed who may worship thee, the _G_ atavedas, with fuel, acquires\nabundance in valiant men, O Agni; he will prosper.\n\n4\\. May He, the banner of the sacrifices, Agni, come hither with the gods,\nanointed by the seven Hot _ri_ s [1](sbe46070.htm#an_3:10:4:1) for the sake of\nthe man who offers sacrificial food.\n\n5\\. Bring ye forward an ancient, mighty speech to Agni, the Hot _ri_ , who is\nlike a worshipper bearing the lights of prayers [1](sbe46070.htm#an_3:10:5:1).\n\n6\\. May our prayers increase Agni, since he is born deserving of praises, the\nconspicuous one, for the sake of great strength and wealth.\n\n7 [1](sbe46070.htm#an_3:10:7:1). May Agni, as the best sacrificer at the\nworship (of men), perform the sacrifice to the gods for the man devoted to the\ngods. As a joyous Hot _ri_ thou reignest (passing) beyond (all) failures.\n\n8\\. Thus, O purifier, shine on us glorious abundance in heroes. Be the nearest\n(friend) to those who praise thee, for their welfare.\n\n9\\. Thus the priests full of admiring praise, having awoke, kindle thee, the\nimmortal carrier of sacrificial food, the increaser of strength.\n\np. 260\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi.
