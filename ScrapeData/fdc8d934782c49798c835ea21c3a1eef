(That) grief of him (arose), this is intimated by his ( _G_ ana _s_\nruti\'s) resorting to him (Raikva) on hearing a disrespectful speech about\nhimself.\n\nFrom what the text says about _G_ ana _s_ ruti Pautraya _n_ a having been\ntaunted by a flamingo for his want of knowledge of Brahman, and having\nthereupon resorted to Raikva, who possessed the knowledge of Brahman, it\nappears that sorrow ( _s_ u _k_ ) had taken possession of him; and it is with\na view to this that Raikva addresses him as _S_ udra. For the word _S_ udra,\netymologically considered, means one who grieves or sorrows ( _s_ o _k_ ati).\nThe appellation \' _s_ udra\' therefore refers to his sorrow, not to his being a\nmember of the fourth caste. This clearly appears from a consideration of the\nwhole story. _G_ ana _s_ ruti Pautraya _n_ a was a very liberal and pious\nking. Being much pleased with his virtuous life, and wishing to rouse in him\nthe desire of knowing Brahman, two noble-minded beings, assuming the shape of\nflamingoes, flew past him at night time, when one of them addressed the other,\n\'O Bhallaksha. the light of _G_ ana _s_ ruti has spread like the sky; do not\ngo\n\np. 340\n\nnear that it may not burn thee.\' To this praise of _G_ ana _s_ ruti the other\nflamingo replied, \'How can you speak of him, being what he is, as if he were\nRaikva "sayuktvan"?\' i.e. \'how can you speak of _G_ ana _s_ ruti, being what\nhe is, as if he were Raikva, who knows Brahman and is endowed with the most\neminent qualities? Raikva, who knows Brahman, alone in this world is truly\neminent. _G_ ana _s_ ruti may be very pious, but as he does not know Brahman\nwhat quality of his could produce splendour capable of burning me like the\nsplendour of Raikva?\' The former flamingo thereupon asks who that Raikva is,\nand its companion replies, \'He in whose work and knowledge there are comprised\nall the works done by good men and all the knowledge belonging to intelligent\ncreatures, that is Raikva.\' _G_ ana _s_ ruti, having heard this speech of the\nflamingo--which implied a reproach to himself as being destitute of the\nknowledge of Brahman, and a glorification of Raikva as possessing that\nknowledge--at once sends his door-keeper to look for Raikva; and when the\ndoor-keeper finds him and brings word, the king himself repairs to him with\nsix hundred cows, a golden necklace, and a carriage yoked with mules, and asks\nhim to teach him the deity on which he meditates, i.e. the highest deity.\nRaikva, who through the might of his Yoga-knowledge is acquainted with\neverything that passes in the three worlds, at once perceives that _G_ ana _s_\nruti is inwardly grieved at the slighting speech of the flamingo, which had\nbeen provoked by the king\'s want of knowledge of Brahman, and is now making an\neffort due to the wish of knowing Brahman; and thus recognises that the king\nis fit for the reception of that knowledge. Reflecting thereupon that a\nknowledge of Brahman may be firmly established in this pupil even without long\nattendance on the teacher if only he will be liberal to the teacher to the\nutmost of his capability, he addresses him: \'Do thou take away (apahara)\n(these things), O _S_ udra; keep (the chariot) with the cows for thyself.\'\nWhat he means to say is, \'By so much only in the way of gifts bestowed on me,\nthe knowledge of Brahman cannot be established in thee, who, through the\ndesire for such knowledge, art plunged\n\np. 341\n\nin grief\'--the address \'O _S_ udra\' intimating that Raikva knows _G_ ana _s_\nruti to be plunged in grief, and on that account fit to receive instruction\nabout Brahman. _G_ ana _s_ ruti thereupon approaches Raikva for a second time,\nbringing as much wealth as he possibly can, and moreover his own daughter.\nRaikva again intimates his view of the pupil\'s fitness for receiving\ninstruction by addressing him a second time as \' _S_ udra,\' and says, \'You\nhave brought these, O _S_ udra; by this mouth only you made me speak,\' i.e.\n\'You now have brought presents to the utmost of your capability; by this means\nonly you will induce me, without lengthy service on your part, to utter speech\ncontaining that instruction about Brahman which you desire.\'--Having said this\nhe begins to instruct him.--We thus see that the appellation \' _s_ udra\' is\nmeant to intimate the grief of _G_ ana _s_ ruti--which grief in its turn\nindicates the king\'s fitness for receiving instruction; and is not meant to\ndeclare that _G_ ana _s_ ruti belongs to the lowest caste.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 34.
