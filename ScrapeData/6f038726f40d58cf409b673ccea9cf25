When the gods had performed the guest-offering, discord arose\nbetween them. They allayed it by means of the Tanunaptra (oaths). They desired\nan atonement for having spoken evil to one another; for they had appointed no\nother consecration-ceremony till the expiatory bath. They perceived this\nintermediate consecration 2.\n\n3:4:3:22\\. By means of fire they enveloped (the body) with a skin. Now, fire\nbeing fervour, and the consecration being fervour, they thereby underwent an\nintermediate consecration; and because they underwent that\n\np. 98\n\nintermediate consecration, therefore this intermediary consecration\n(avantaradiksha, is performed). They turned in their fingers more tightly and\ndrew 1 their zone tighter, whereby they (again) put round them what had been\nput round them before 2;--and so does he thereby make atonement for what\nheretofore he has done injurious to the vow, for what he has spoken injurious\nto the vow.\n\n3:4:3:33\\. By means of the fire they (the priests) envelop him with a skin.\nNow, fire being fervour, and the consecration being fervour, he thereby\nundergoes an intermediate consecration. He turns in his fingers more tightly\nand draws the zone tighter, whereby he (again) puts round himself what was put\nround him before. Moreover, it was offspring the gods thereby obtained.\n\n3:4:3:44\\. By means of Agni (fire) they enveloped (the body) with a skin. Now,\nAgni being the causer of sexual union, the progenitor, they thereby obtained\noffspring. They turned in their fingers more tightly and drew their zone\ntighter, whereby they produced offspring for themselves. And in like manner\ndoes he (the sacrificer) thereby obtain offspring.\n\n3:4:3:55\\. By means of Agni he envelops himself with a skin. Now, Agni being\nthe causer of sexual union, the progenitor, he thereby 3 obtains offspring. He\nturns in his fingers more tightly and draws his zone tighter, whereby he\nproduces offspring for himself.\n\n3:4:3:66\\. Now, while the gods were consecrated, whichever of them fetched\nfire-wood or uttered his appointed texts, him the Asura-Rakshas endeavoured to\n\np. 99\n\nstrike--the one by (assuming) the form of this one, and the other by that of\nanother. They came together, upbraiding one another, saying, 'See, what thou\nhast clone to me! see, how thou hast struck me!' But Agni alone did not speak\nthus to any one, nor did any one speak thus to Agni.\n\n3:4:3:77\\. They said, 'Have they spoken thus to thee also, Agni?' He said,\n'Verily, I have not spoken to any one, nor has any one spoken to me.'\n\n3:4:3:88\\. They became aware,--'He verily is the greatest repeller of the\nRakshas among us; let us be like him: thereby we shall escape from the\nRakshas, thereby we shall attain to the heavenly world.' They accordingly\nbecame like Agni, and thereby escaped from the Rakshas and attained to the\nheavenly world. And in like manner does this one now become like Agni, and\nthereby escape from the Rakshas and attain to the heavenly world. It is in\nputting a kindling-stick on (the \xc3\x82havaniya fire 1) that he enters upon the\nAvantaradiksha.\n\n3:4:3:99\\. He puts on the kindling-stick, with the text (Va _g_. S. V, 6), 'O\nAgni, protector of vows; on thee, O protector of vows--' for Agni is lord of\nvows to the gods; wherefore he says, 'O Agni, protector of vows, on thee, O\nprotector of vows--' 'what bodily form 2 there is of thine, (may that be) here\non me; and what bodily form there is of mine, (may that be) on thee! May my\nvows be bound up with thine, O lord of vows!' whereby he envelops himself with\nthe skin by means of Agni, 'May the lord of consecration approve my\n\np. 100\n\nconsecration, and the lord of penance my penance!' Thereby he enters upon the\nintermediary consecration. More closely he turns in his fingers, and closer he\ndraws the zone; whereby he (again) puts round himself what was put round him\nbefore.\n\n3:4:3:1010\\. They then attend on him with the boiling lustral water\n(madanti);--fire is heat, and the lustral water is heat: that is why they\nattend on him with the lustral water.\n\n3:4:3:1111\\. Having touched the lustral water, they (the priests and\nsacrificer) therewith strengthen 1 the king (Soma). The reason why, after\ntouching the lustral water, they strengthen the king is this;--ghee is a\nthunderbolt, and Soma is seed: hence they strengthen the king after touching\nthe lustral water, lest they should injure the seed, Soma, by the thunderbolt,\nthe ghee.\n\n3:4:3:1212\\. Here now they say, 'Him, Soma, for whom that strengthening\n(meal), the guest-offering, is prepared, they ought first to strengthen, and\nthen (ought to be performed) the Avantaradiksha, and thereupon the\nTanunaptra.' But let him not do this. For such indeed was the course of the\nsacrificial performance: discord arose between them (the gods) thereat; they\nattained to their former tranquillity; then the Avantaradiksha and finally the\nstrengthening.\n\n3:4:3:1313\\. Then as to why they strengthen (Soma). Soma is a god, since Soma\n(the moon) is in the sky. 'Soma, forsooth, was V _ri_ tra; his body is the\nsame as the mountains and rocks: thereon grows that plant called U _s_ ana,'--\nso said _S_ vetaketu Auddalaki;\n\np. 101\n\n[paragraph continues] 'they fetch it hither and press it; and by means of the\nconsecration and the Upasads, by the Tanunaptra and the strengthening they\nmake it into Soma.' And in like manner does he now make it into Soma by means\nof the consecration and the Upasads, by the Tanunaptra and the strengthening.\n\n3:4:3:1414\\. 'It is bees' honey,' they say; for bees' honey means the\nsacrifice, and the bees that make the honey are no other than the officiating\npriests; and in like manner as the working-bees make the honey increase, so do\nthey (the priests) thereby strengthen the sacrifice.\n\n3:4:3:1515\\. By means of the sacrifice the gods gained that supreme authority\nwhich they now wield. They spake, 'How can this (world) of ours be made\nunattainable to men?' Having sipped the sap of the sacrifice, as bees would\nsuck out honey, and having drained the sacrifice and scattered it by means of\nthe sacrificial post, they disappeared; and because they scattered (yopaya)\ntherewith, therefore it is called yupa (post).\n\n3:4:3:1616\\. Now this was heard by the _Ri_ shis. They collected the\nsacrifice; and as that sacrifice was collected, so does he collect the\nsacrifice who is consecrated. The sacrifice is speech: hence he thereby again\nsupplies what part of the sacrifice here has been sucked out and drained.\n\n3:4:3:1717\\. They strengthen (the Soma), being six 1:--there are six seasons:\nhaving become the seasons, they strengthen it 2.\n\n3:4:3:1818\\. They strengthen him with (Va _g_. S. V, 7),\n\np. 102\n\n[paragraph continues] 'Let stalk after stalk of thine wax strong, O divine\nSoma!' whereby they strengthen (increase) stalk after stalk of his;--'for\nIndra, the winner of the ekadhanas 1;' Indra indeed is the deity of the\nsacrifice: therefore he says, 'For Indra, the winner (or bestower) of the\nekadhanas.' For verily every one of those stalks swells to fill a hundred or\nten 2 ekadhana cups for the several gods. 'May Indra wax strong for thee, and\nwax thou strong for Indra!' for Indra is the deity of the sacrifice: he thus\nstrengthens him who is the deity of the sacrifice. By saying, 'Wax thou strong\nfor Indra,' he instils that invigorating draught into him. 'Strengthen us\nfriends with gain and understanding!' 'With gain' he says with reference to\nwhat he gains; and 'with understanding' he says with reference to what he\nrecites. 'Mayest thou thrive, O divine Soma, and may I attain to the Soma-\nfeast!' They, the priests and sacrificer, have one prayer in common, 'May we\nreach the end of the sacrifice!' hence he thereby means to say, 'May I reach\nthe end of the sacrifice!'\n\n3:4:3:1919\\. Thereupon they make amends on the prastara. For the sacrifice\nrequires a northward attendance;\n\np. 103\n\nbut now they strengthen (Soma) after going, as it were, towards the right\n(south) 1; and, the sacrifice being the fire, they thereby turn their back on\nthe sacrifice and thus do wrong and are cut off from the gods. Now the\nprastara also is (part of) the sacrifice, and by (touching) it they again get\nhold of the sacrifice. And this is his expiation of that (transgression); and\nso no wrong is committed by them and they are not cut off from the gods: for\nthis reason they make amends on the prastara.\n\n3:4:3:2020\\. Here now they say, 'On the anointed?--let them rather make amends\non the unanointed 2!' They should indeed make amends on the un-anointed\n(prastara), since anointed it is thrown into the fire.\n\n3:4:3:2121\\. They make amends 3 with, 'Desirable treasures (may come) forth\nfor strength and well-being--the right for the right-saying'--whereby\n\np. 104\n\nhe means to say, 'the truth for the truth-speaking;'--'Homage be to Heaven and\nto the Earth!' whereby they make amends to these two, heaven and earth, on\nwhom this All is founded.\n\n3:4:3:2222\\. Having then picked up the prastara, he says, 'Agnidh, does the\nwater boil? It boils,' replies the Agnidh 1. 'Come hither with it!' He holds\n(the prastara) quite close over the fire. The reason why he does not throw it\ninto the fire is that he (the sacrificer) is to perform therewith 2 during the\ndays that follow; and in that he holds it quite close over the fire, thereby\nit is for him as if it were really thrown into the fire. He hands it to the\nAgnidh, and the Agnidh puts it aside (in a safe place).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[97:2](sbe2617.htm#fr_257) The Avantaradiksha extends to the end of the sixth\nBrahma _n_ a.\n\n[98:1](sbe2617.htm#fr_258) Our text has no verb; the Ka _n_ va recension reads\n'auhanta.'\n\n[98:2](sbe2617.htm#fr_259) Viz. the diksha, as symbolised by the zone (or the\nskin).\n\n[98:3](sbe2617.htm#fr_260) Viz. through Agni, or the Avantaradiksha.\n\n[99:1](sbe2617.htm#fr_261) The sacrificer's wife performs silently on and near\nthe Garhapatya fire the same ceremonies as her husband.\n\n[99:2](sbe2617.htm#fr_262) Tanu, see [p. 10](sbe2604.htm#page_10), note\n[4](sbe2604.htm#fn_40).\n\n[100:1](sbe2617.htm#fr_263) On the 'apyayana' (a-pyai,'to swell; make swell,'\nto strengthen, become strong, increase, fill), see part i, p. 178, note 2.\nAccording to \xc3\x82pastamba and other authorities, they tie a piece of gold to\ntheir nameless (gold) finger, and touch the Soma with their moist hands.\n\n[101:1](sbe2617.htm#fr_264) Viz. the five priests--Brahman, Udgat _ri_ , Hot\n_ri_ , Adhvaryu, and \xc3\x82gnidhra--and the sacrificer.\n\n[101:2](sbe2617.htm#fr_265) That is, as the seasons make the Soma-plant grow.\n\n[102:1](sbe2617.htm#fr_266) Ekadhana-vid; the meaning of 'ekadhana'\n(apparently 'one prize' or 'one part of the booty or goods') in this compound\nis not clear. The author of the Brahma _n_ a seems to take it in its technical\nsense, viz. the ekadhana pitchers in which the ekadhana water, used for mixing\nwith the Soma juice, is kept, see [III, 9, 3](sbe2638.htm#3:9:3);\n[16](sbe2638.htm#3:9:3:16); [27](sbe2638.htm#3:9:3:27);\n[34](sbe2638.htm#3:9:3:34). According to Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p. 114 notes,\nthey are so called because the Adhvaryu throws one stalk of Soma (eka-dhana)\ninto each pitcher to consecrate it.\n\n[102:2](sbe2617.htm#fr_267) This anticlimax is rather curious. The Ka _n_ va\ntext reads: da _s_ a da _s_ a va ha smaisha ekaiko ' _m_ _s_ ur devan\npratindrayaikadhanan apyayayanti (!) _s_ ata _m_ _s_ atam va tasmad\nahaikadhanavida iti.\n\n[103:1](sbe2617.htm#fr_268) Soma's throne stands south of the \xc3\x82havaniya fire,\nand in going to perform the apyayanam upon him, the priests and sacrificer\nhave to move round the fire, along the east side of it towards the south (the\nregion of the Fathers).\n\n[103:2](sbe2617.htm#fr_269) This seems to be Saya _n_ a's interpretation of\nthe passage 'akte nihnuvir\xc4\x81\xcc\x83n anakt\xc4\x81\xcc\x83i.' The two words, with their final\nsyllable protracted, being intended to strongly contradict the preceding\n'akte.' It is hardly possible to take the latter absolutely, 'it being\nanointed (when thrown into the fire), let them make amends on it while\nunanointed.' On the throwing of the prastara into the fire, see I, 8, 3, 17.\nThe prastara referred to is that of the guest-offering (atithyesh _t_ i),\nwhich was broken off after the I _d_ a ceremony (see III, 4, I, 26) and has to\nbe completed after the present ceremony. Neither the prastara nor the barhis\nis burnt on this occasion.\n\n[103:3](sbe2617.htm#fr_270) In performing this propitiatory rite, the priests\nand sacrificer lay their hands on the prastara, either both of them with the\npalms upwards, or only the right one, and the left in the opposite way. Katy.\nVIII, 2, 9. The latter mode is the one practised by the Taittiriyas. Say. on\nTaitt. S. I, 2, 11.\n\n[104:1](sbe2617.htm#fr_271) According to the Ka _n_ va text, this conversation\ntakes the place of the colloquy (samudita) held by the Adhvaryu and the\n\xc3\x82gnidhra, after the prastara has been thrown into the fire at the normal ish\n_t_ i; see I, 8, 3, 20.\n\n[104:2](sbe2617.htm#fr_272) Or, 'in the shape of it (tena),' the prastara\nrepresenting the sacrificer himself. This sentence seems also to imply, that\nthe sacrificer thereby continues to live during the days that follow.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 4. Fourth Brahma _n_ a](sbe2618.htm)\n\n"
