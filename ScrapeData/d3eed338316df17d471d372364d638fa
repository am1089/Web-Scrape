 \nMisfortunes all his life attend.  \nAnd his brief days are near their end.  \nUnworthy prince, infirm of mind!  \nA woman spoke and he resigned  \nHis home and kingdom and withdrew  \nFrom troops of friends and retinue.  \nAnd sought this forest dark and dread  \nBy savage beasts inhabited.\'  \nThus Ravan urged the lady meet  \nFor love, whose words were soft and sweet.  \nNear and more near the giant pressed  \nAs love\'s hot fire inflamed his breast.  \nThe leader of the giant crew  \nHis arm around the lady threw:  \nThus Budha  1 with ill-omened might  \nSteals Rohini\'s delicious light.  \nOne hand her glorious tresses grasped,  \nOne with its ruthless pressure clasped  \nThe body of his lovely prize,  \nThe Maithil dame with lotus eyes.  \nThe silvan Gods in wild alarm  \nMarked his huge teeth and ponderous arm,  \nAnd from that Death-like presence fled,  \nOf mountain size and towering head.  \nThen seen was Ravan\'s magic car  \nAglow with gold which blazed afar,--  \nThe mighty car which asses drew  \nThundering as it onward flew.  \nHe spared not harsh rebuke to chide  \nThe lady as she moaned and cried,  \nThen with his arm about her waist  \nHis captive in the car he placed.  \nIn vain he threatened: long and shrill  \nRang out her lamentation still,  \nO Rama! which no fear could stay:  \nBut her dear lord was far away  \nThen rose the fiend, and toward the skies  \nBore his poor helpless struggling prize:  \n\nHurrying through the air above  \nThe dame who loathed his proffered love  \nSo might a soaring eagle bear  \nA serpent\'s consort through the air.  \nAs on he bore her through the sky  \nShe shrieked aloud her bitter cry.  \nAs when some wretch\'s lips complain  \nIn agony of maddening pain;  \n\'O Lakshman, thou whose joy is still  \nTo do thine eider brother\'s will,  \nThis fiend, who all disguises wears,  \nFrom Rama\'s side his darling tears.  \nThou who couldst leave bliss, fortune, all,  \nYea life itselt at duty\'s call,  \nDost thou not see this outrage done  \nTo hapless me, O Raghu\'s son?  \n\'Tis thine, O victor of the foe,  \nTo bring the haughtiest spirit low,  \nHow canst thou such an outrage see  \nAnd let the guilty fiend go free?  \nAh, seldom in a moment\'s time  \nComes bitter fruit of sin and crime,  \nBut in the day of harvest pain  \nComes like the ripening of the grain.  \nSo thou whom fate and folly lead  \nTo ruin for this guilty deed,  \nShalt die by Rama\'s arm ere long  \nA dreadful death for hideous wrong.  \nAh, too successful in their ends  \nAre Queen Kaikeyi and her friends,  \nWhen virtuous Rama, dear to fame,  \nIs mourning for his ravished dame.  \nAh me, ah me! a long farewell  \nTo lawn and glade and forest dell  \nIn Janasthan\'s wild region, where  \nThe Cassia trees are bright and fair  \nWith all your tongues to Rama say  \nThat Ravan bears his wife away.  \nFarewell, a long farewell to thee,  \nO pleasant stream Godavari,  \nWhose rippling waves are ever stirred  \nBy many a glad wild water bird!  \nAll ye to Rama\'s ear relate  \nThe giant\'s deed and Sita\'s fata.  \nO all ye Gods who love this ground  \nWhere trees of every leaf abound,  \nTell Rama I am stolen hence,  \nI pray you all with reverence.  \nOn all the living things beside  \nThat these dark boughs and coverts hide,  \nYe flocks of birds ye troops of deer,  \nI call on you my prayer to hear.  \nAll we to Rama\'s ear proclaim  \nThat Ravan tears away his dame  \nWitn forceful arms--his darling wife,  \nDearer to Rama than his life.  \nO, if he knew I dwelt in hell,  \nMy mighty lord, I know full well,  \nWould bring me, conqueror, back to-day,  \nThough Yama\'s self reclaimed his prey.\'  \nThus from the air the lady sent  \n\np. 288  \n\nWith piteous voice her last lament,  \nAnd as she wept she chanced to see  \nThe vulture on a lofty tree.  \nAs Ravan bore her swiftly by,  \nOn the dear bird she bent her eye,  \nAnd with a voice which woe made faint  \nRenewed to him her wild complaint:  \n\'O see, the king who rules the race  \nOf giants, cruel, fierce and base,  \nRavan the spoiler bears me hence  \nThe helpless prey of violence.  \nThis fiend who roves in midnight shade  \nBy thee, dear bird, can ne\'er be stayed,  \nFor he is armed and fierce and strong  \nTriumphant in the power to wrong.  \nFor thee remains one only task,  \nTo do, kind friend, the thing I ask.  \nTo Rama\'s ear by thee be borne  \nHow Sita from her home is torn,  \nAnd to the valiant Lakshman tell  \nThe giant\'s deed and what befell.\'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[287:1](ry247.htm#fr_504) Mercury: to be carefully distinguished hum Buddha.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto L.: Jatayus.](ry248.htm)\n\n'
