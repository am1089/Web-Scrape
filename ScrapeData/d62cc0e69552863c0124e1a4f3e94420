b"[![](../../cdshop/cdinfo.jpg)](../../cdshop/index.htm)  \n[Sacred Texts](../../index.htm)  [Hinduism](../index.htm)  [Index](index.htm)\n[Previous](sbe0862.htm)\n\n* * *\n\n# CHAPTER XXXVI.\n\nBrahman said:\n\nSince the mind is ruler of these five elements, in (the matter of) absorbing\nor bringing (them) forth 6,\n\np. 386\n\nthe mind itself is the individual self 1. The mind always presides over the\ngreat elements. The understanding proclaims its power 2, and it is called the\nKshetra _g_ \xc3\xb1a. The mind yokes the senses as a charioteer (yokes) good horses.\nThe senses, the mind, and the understanding are always joined to the Kshetra\n_g_ \xc3\xb1a 3. That individual self, mounting the chariot to which big horses 4 are\nyoked, and in which the understanding is the drag 5, drives about on all\nsides. the great chariot which is pervaded by the Brahman 6, has the group of\nthe senses yoked (to it), has the mind for a charioteer, and the understanding\nfor a drag. That learned and talented person verily, who always understands\nthus the chariot pervaded by the Brahman, comes not by delusion in the midst\nof all entities 7. This forest of the Brahman 8 begins with the unperceived,\nand ends with the gross objects 9;\n\np. 387\n\nand includes movables and immovables, receives light from the radiance of the\nsun and moon, is adorned with planets and nakshatras, and is decked on all\nsides with nets of rivers and mountains, and always beautified likewise by\nvarious (descriptions of) waters; it is (the means of) subsistence for all\nentities 1, and it is the goal of all living creatures. In this the Kshetra\n_g_ \xc3\xb1a always moves about. Whatever entities (there are) in this world,\nmovable or immovable, they are the very first 2 to be dissolved; and next the\ndevelopments produced from the elements 3; and (after) these developments, all\nthe elements. Such is the upward gradation 4 among entities. Gods, men,\nGandharvas, Pi _s_ akas, Asuras, Rakshasas, all have been created by nature 5,\nnot by actions, nor by a cause. These Brahma _n_ as 6, the creators of the\nworld, are born here again and again. And whatever\n\np. 388\n\nis produced from them 1 is dissolved in due time in those very five great\nelements, like billows in the ocean. The great elements are in every way\n(beyond) the elements that make up the world 2. And he who is released, even\nfrom those five elements, goes to the highest goal. The Lord Pra _g_ apati\ncreated all this by the mind 3 only. And in the same manner 4 the sages\nattained the godhead 5 by means of penance 6. And in like manner, those who\nhave achieved perfection, who have acquired concentration by a course of\npenance, and who likewise feed on fruits and roots, perceive the triple world\n7 here by penance. Medicines, and herbs, and the various sciences are all\nacquired 8 by means of penance alone. For all acquisition 9 has penance for\nits root. Whatever is difficult to obtain 10, difficult to\n\np. 389\n\nlearn, difficult to vanquish, and difficult to pass through; all that can be\naccomplished by penance, for penance is difficult to overcome. One who drinks\nspirituous liquors, one who kills a Brahma _n_ a, one who steals, one who\ndestroys an embryo, one who violates the bed of his preceptor 1, is released\nfrom, that sin only by penance well performed. (Those) men, Pitris, gods,\n(sacrificial) animals 2, beasts and birds, and all other creatures movable or\nimmovable, (who are) constantly devoted to penance, always reach perfection by\npenance. And in like manner the noble(-minded) gods went to heaven 3. Those\nwho without sloth perform actions with expectations, and being full of egoism,\nthey go near Pra _g_ apati 4. Those high-souled ones who are devoid of (the\nthought that this or that is) mine, and devoid of egoism, by means of a pure\nconcentration (of mind) on contemplation, obtain the great and highest world.\nThose who best understand the self, attaining concentration (of mind) on\ncontemplation 5, and having their minds always tranquil, enter into the\nunperceived accumulation of happiness 6. Those\n\np. 390\n\nwho are free from (all thought that this or that is) mine, and who are free\nfrom egoism, attaining concentration (of mind) on contemplation 1, enter the\nhighest world of the great, which is the unperceived. Born from that same\nunperceived 2 (principle), again acquiring knowledge, and getting rid of the\n(qualities of) passion and darkness, and resorting to the pure (quality of)\ngoodness, a man gets rid of all sins, and abandons everything as fruitless. He\nshould be understood to be the Kshetra _g_ \xc3\xb1a. He who understands him\nunderstands the Vedas 3. Withdrawing from the mind the objects 4 of mental\noperations, a sage should sit down self-restrained. (He) necessarily (becomes)\nthat on which his mind 5 (is fixed). This is the eternal mystery. That which\nbegins with the unperceived and ends with the gross objects 6 is stated to be\nof the nature of ignorance 7. But (you should) learn that whose nature is\ndevoid\n\np. 391\n\nof qualities. Two syllables 1 are death; three syllables the eternal Brahman.\nMine is death, and not mine is the eternal 2. Some men of dull understandings\nextol action. But as to the high-souled ancients they do not extol action 3.\nBy action a creature is born with a body and made up of the sixteen 4.\nKnowledge brings forth 5 the being, and that is acceptable and constitutes\nimmortality. Therefore those who are far-sighted have no attachment to\nactions. This being is stated to be full of knowledge, not full of action 6.\nThe self-restrained man who thus understands the immortal, changeless,\nincomprehensible, and ever indestructible and unattached (principle), he dies\nnot 7. He who thus understands the self to which there is nothing prior, which\nis uncreated, changeless, unmoving 8, which is incomprehensible (even) to\nthose who feed on nectar, he certainly becomes immortal 7 and not to be\nrestrained 9, in consequence of these means 10.\n\np. 392\n\nExpelling all impressions 1, and restraining the self in the Self 2, he\nunderstands that holy Brahman, than which nothing greater exists. And when the\nunderstanding is clear, he attains tranquillity 3. And the nature of\ntranquillity is as when one sees a dream 4. This 5 is the goal of those\nemancipated ones who are intent on knowledge. And they see all the movements 6\nwhich are produced by development. This is the goal of those who are\nindifferent (to the world). This is the eternal piety. This is what is\nacquired by men of knowledge. This is the uncensured (mode of) conduct. This\ngoal can be reached by one who is alike to all beings 7, who is without\nattachment, who is without expectations,\n\np. 393\n\nand who looks alike on everything 1. I have now declared everything to you, O\nbest of Brahma _n_ a, sages! Act thus forthwith; then you will acquire\nperfection.\n\nThe preceptor said:\n\nThus instructed by the preceptor Brahman, those high-souled sages acted\naccordingly, and then attained to the worlds 2. Do you, too, O noble person,\nof pure self! duly act according to the words of Brahman which I have stated.\nThen will you attain perfection.\n\nVasudeva, said:\n\nThat pupil thus instructed in the highest piety by the preceptor, did\neverything (accordingly), O son of Kunti! and then attained final\nemancipation. And the pupil, having done all he should have done, attained to\nthat seat, O supporter of the family of the Kauravas! going to which one\ngrieves not 3.\n\nAr _g_ una said:\n\nWho, indeed, was that Brahma _n_ a, O K _ri_ sh _n_ a! and who the pupil, O\n_G_ anardana! If this verily, is fit to be heard by me, O Lord! then tell it\nme.\n\nVasudeva said:\n\nI 4 am the preceptor, O you of mighty arms! and\n\np. 394\n\nknow the mind to be my pupil. And, O Dhana\xc3\xb1 _g_ aya! I have related this\nmystery to you out of love for you. If you have love for me, O supporter of\nthe family of the Kauravas! then having heard this (instruction) relating to\nthe self, always duly act 1 (according to it). Then when this piety is duly\npractised, you will attain the absolute final emancipation, getting rid of all\nsins. It was this same thing I stated to you before 2 when the time for battle\nhad come, O you of mighty arms! Therefore fix your mind on this. And now 3, O\nchief of the descendants of Bharata! it is long since I saw the lord my\nfather. I wish to see him, with your consent, O Phalguna 4!\n\nVai _s_ ampayana said,\n\nWhen K _ri_ sh _n_ a spoke these words, Dhana\xc3\xb1gaya replied (saying), 'O K _ri_\nsh _n_ a! let us verily go to-day to the city of Ga _g_ asa 5. Be pleased, O\nyou who understand piety! to see there king Yudhish _th_ ira, who is of a\ndevout heart, and after taking leave of him to go to your own city.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[385:1](sbe0862.htm#fr_2002) This is the Hindu. Gamut.\n\n[385:2](sbe0862.htm#fr_2003) These are not in the _S_ anti Parvan; of many\ningredients = collection of sounds, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[385:3](sbe0862.htm#fr_2004) Being all-pervading, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra. Cf.\nits position at Taittiriya, p. 67.\n\n[385:4](sbe0862.htm#fr_2005) Cf. Ka _th_ a, pp. 114, 115, 149, and Sa _n_ kara\n_k_ arya's commentary there, for an explanation of the whole passage. And see\nSa _n_ kya-sara, p. 16, as to what are here called self and understanding.\n\n[385:5](sbe0862.htm#fr_2006) Cf. Gita, [p. 64](sbe0807.htm#page_64), where the\nwords are identical.\n\n[385:6](sbe0863.htm#fr_2007) The elements are perceived or are not perceived\nby the senses tinder the direction of the mind; absorbing = destroying;\nbringing forth = producing, Nilaka _nth_ a. See [p. 268](sbe0834.htm#page_268)\nsupra, and _S_ anti Parvan (Moksha), chap. 240, st. 12.\n\n[386:1](sbe0863.htm#fr_2008) The word is the same as at Maitri, p. 41, the\ncomment on which should be seen.\n\n[386:2](sbe0863.htm#fr_2009) I. e. the mind 's power is to be perceived by\nitself, Nilaka _nth_ a. The meaning seems to be that the understanding can\nonly operate on what the mind places before it.\n\n[386:3](sbe0863.htm#fr_2010) The passage at Ka _th_ a, p. 111 seq., and Sa _n_\nkara's commentary there, throw light on this, though the figure is not drawn\nout in the same way in both places. For a definition of Kshetra _g_ \xc3\xb1a, see\n_S_ anti Parvan (Moksha), chap. 187, st. 23.\n\n[386:4](sbe0863.htm#fr_2011) I. e. the senses.\n\n[386:5](sbe0863.htm#fr_2012) I. e. that which holds the horses in check.\nNilaka _nth_ a seems to render it by 'whip,' but that is not correct, I think.\n\n[386:6](sbe0863.htm#fr_2013) So Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra. Nilaka _nth_ a says,\n'The senses, &c., when they turn towards the outer world make the self drive\nabout, as an individual self; when turned inwards they show him that he is the\nBrahman.' Nilaka _nth_ a thus likens this to the Ka _th_ a passage. See also\np. 187 and notes there.\n\n[386:7](sbe0863.htm#fr_2014) Or it, may mean, among all men.\n\n[386:8](sbe0863.htm#fr_2015) See [p. 164](sbe0824.htm#page_164) supra, note\n[2](sbe0824.htm#fn_719); and [p. 295](sbe0841.htm#page_295), note\n[4](sbe0841.htm#fn_1425).\n\n[386:9](sbe0863.htm#fr_2016) That is to say, it includes all Sa _m_ sara, all\nthe elements recognised by the Sa _n_ khya philosophy, save the Being or\nPurusha.\n\n[387:1](sbe0863.htm#fr_2017) Cf. [p. 371](sbe0859.htm#page_371) supra.\n\n[387:2](sbe0863.htm#fr_2018) Another reading means 'they are dissolved in the\nwaters.' As to the order, cf. Vedanta Paribhasha, p. 48, and [p.\n335](sbe0854.htm#page_335) supra.\n\n[387:3](sbe0863.htm#fr_2019) I take these to mean the gross elements of which\nthings movable and immovable may be said to be made, if one may use a non-\nidealist phrase in the Sa _n_ khya philosophy. Then the elements next spoken\nof are the subtle ones or tanmatras. Cf. the references in note  2. As to\ndevelopments, see [p. 382](sbe0862.htm#page_382), note\n[4](sbe0862.htm#fn_1983).\n\n[387:4](sbe0863.htm#fr_2020) Viz. gross object, gross element, subtle element.\n\n[387:5](sbe0863.htm#fr_2021) The original is svabhava, which Ar _g_ una Mi _s_\nra renders by Prak _ri_ ti. 'Actions' both Nilaka _nth_ a and Ar _g_ una Mi\n_s_ ra take to mean sacrifices, &c., and 'cause' the former interprets by\nBrahman; the latter by tanmatras or subtle elements, and adds, 'the sense is\nnot by sacrifice or tanmatras only.' Nilaka _nth_ a says, 'The gods, &c., are\nproduced by nature, as the gods, &c., seen in a dream.' The meaning seems to\nbe that there are energies in nature which evolve these forms of being. Cf.\nalso Gita, [p. 65](sbe0807.htm#page_65).\n\n[387:6](sbe0863.htm#fr_2022) I presume this means that the patriarchs (Mariki\nand others, says Nilaka _nth_ a) are also born again and again--that is to\nsay, in different kalpas, I suppose--by nature only.\n\n[388:1](sbe0863.htm#fr_2023) I think this must mean the elements, though it\nmight at first sight be referred to the Brahma _n_ as.\n\n[388:2](sbe0863.htm#fr_2024) I. e. the gross elements, I take it; the others\nare. the tanmatras.\n\n[388:3](sbe0863.htm#fr_2025) I. e. the meditation which constitutes true\nknowledge, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra. But see Gita, [p. 87](sbe0812.htm#page_87),\nnote  [1](sbe0812.htm#fn_346), and Sa _n_ khya-sutra.\n\n[388:4](sbe0863.htm#fr_2026) I. e. by the mind, as to which cf. Taittiriya, p.\n89; Ka _th_ a, p. 164. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says, 'This apparent deviation\nfrom the ordinary modes of cause and effect is not altogether without\nparallel, so he adds this to show that.'\n\n[388:5](sbe0863.htm#fr_2027) Literally, 'the gods,' but the meaning seems to\nbe that given in the text, as Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says.\n\n[388:6](sbe0863.htm#fr_2028) This is only the concentration of mind and senses\non one object, Nilaka _nth_ a. See [p. 166](sbe0824.htm#page_166), note\n[1](sbe0824.htm#fn_737) supra.\n\n[388:7](sbe0863.htm#fr_2029) See [p. 174](sbe0824.htm#page_174) supra.\n\n[388:8](sbe0863.htm#fr_2030) Literally, 'are accomplished,' which seems to\nmean that they are acquired so as to be practically at one's command when\nrequired.\n\n[388:9](sbe0863.htm#fr_2031) The original word is derived from the same root\nas the subject of the last note.\n\n[388:10](sbe0863.htm#fr_2032) Difficult to obtain = the seat of Indra, &c.; to\nlearn = Vedas, &c.; to vanquish = fire. &c.; to pass through = a great deluge,\n&c., p. 389 Nilaka _nth_ a. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra seems to interpret the last\nword, where his reading is doubtful, to mean 'difficult to do.'\n\n[389:1](sbe0863.htm#fr_2033) Cf. _Kh_ andogya, p. 361. Except the destruction\nof the embryo (see Taitt. \xc3\x82ra _n_. p. 870, but at B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p.\n795, Kaushitaki, p. 77, and \xc3\x82pastamba I, 6, 19, 16, the commentators render\nBhru _n_ a by learned Brahma _n_ a), the rest are the great sins. But note\nthat stealing gold, not theft generally, is mentioned as a great sin.\n\n[389:2](sbe0863.htm#fr_2034) Or, perhaps, cattle. The original is pa _s_ u.\n\n[389:3](sbe0863.htm#fr_2035) See [p. 160](sbe0823.htm#page_160) supra, and cf.\n[p. 178](sbe0825.htm#page_178).\n\n[389:4](sbe0863.htm#fr_2036) I. e. Ka _s_ yapa, as gods, &c. This seems to be\nAr _g_ una Mi _s_ ra's interpretation. This condition is inferior to that\ndescribed in the following sentence.\n\n[389:5](sbe0863.htm#fr_2037) See [p. 162](sbe0823.htm#page_162), note\n[1](sbe0824.htm#fn_705).\n\n[389:6](sbe0863.htm#fr_2038) Nilaka _nth_ a 's rendering is 'that by which\n(worldly) happiness is p. 390 heightened.' He compares B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka,\np. 816. See also Taittiriya, p. 112.\n\n[390:1](sbe0863.htm#fr_2039) See Gita, [p. 128](sbe0820.htm#page_128), note\n[1](sbe0820.htm#fn_557), where dhyana and yoga are taken separately. Here the\ncompound is in the singular. Nilaka _nth_ a's reading is different.\n\n[390:2](sbe0863.htm#fr_2040) The sense here is not quite clear. It seems,\nhowever, to be this. The acquisitions mentioned in the preceding sentence take\nthe acquirers to some temporary world from which they afterwards return; but\nwhen they get rid of the qualities, they get final emancipation. As to the\nunperceived, cf. inter alia Gita, [p. 112](sbe0817.htm#page_112), note\n[2](sbe0817.htm#fn_470).\n\n[390:3](sbe0863.htm#fr_2041) Cf. Gita, [p. 111](sbe0817.htm#page_111), and\nnote  [2](sbe0817.htm#fn_468) there. That seems to approach the question from\nthe opposite point of view.\n\n[390:4](sbe0863.htm#fr_2042) So Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra. At Gita XVI, 16, _k_\nitta means the operation itself. That also will do here.\n\n[390:5](sbe0863.htm#fr_2043) Cf. Gita, [p. 78](sbe0810.htm#page_78); Maitri,\np. 178; Pra _s_ na, p. 194; and the quotations at Sa _n_ khya-sara, p. 3.\n\n[390:6](sbe0863.htm#fr_2044) This phrase has occurred before; it means all the\ndevelopments which make up worldly life. See Sa _n_ khya-sara, p. 5.\n\n[390:7](sbe0863.htm#fr_2045) See [p. 371](sbe0859.htm#page_371) supra.\n\n[391:1](sbe0863.htm#fr_2046) See _S_ anti Parvan (Ra _g_ adharma) XIII, 4. Cf.\nMaitri, p. 180 This means the two and three syllables of 'mama' and 'na mama,'\nmine and not mine. Cf. B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka p. 970, and _Kh_ andogya, p.\n118, and p. 548, for a similar conceit.\n\n[391:2](sbe0863.htm#fr_2047) Final emancipation follows on abandoning the idea\nof 'mine;' bondage on harbouring it.\n\n[391:3](sbe0863.htm#fr_2048) See Mu _nd_ aka, p. 279.\n\n[391:4](sbe0863.htm#fr_2049) The eleven organs and the five great elements\nwhich go to form the body. See Sa _n_ khya-karika 3, and comment thereon; _S_\nanti Parvan, chap. 210, st. 32 seq.; chap. 242, st. 7 seq.; Pra _s_ na, p.\n230.\n\n[391:5](sbe0863.htm#fr_2050) I. e. shows.\n\n[391:6](sbe0863.htm#fr_2051) Cf. Gita, [p. 118](sbe0819.htm#page_118); _S_\nanti Parvan, ch. 242, st. 15.\n\n[391:7](sbe0863.htm#fr_2054) See [p. 367](sbe0858.htm#page_367) supra, note\n[6](sbe0858.htm#fn_1875); and cf. Ka _th_ a, pp. 155, 156.\n\n[391:8](sbe0863.htm#fr_2053) I. e. which remains unconcerned, cf. \xc3\x8e _s_ a, p.\n10. Apurvam (to which there is nothing prior), Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra renders by\n'not familiarly known,' and Nilaka _nth_ a by 'not understood by any other\nmeans of knowledge.' See also B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p. 502, and _S_ a _n_\nkara on that.\n\n[391:9](sbe0863.htm#fr_2055) This is not very clear, but I suppose the meaning\nto be the same as that of 'unconquerable' at [p. 161](sbe0823.htm#page_161),\nand see [p. 231](sbe0828.htm#page_231).\n\n[391:10](sbe0863.htm#fr_2056) I. e. the means mentioned further on, says\nNilaka _nth_ a.\n\n[392:1](sbe0863.htm#fr_2057) Impressions from external causes. Cf. inter alia\nSa _n_ khya-sutra III, 83; see, too, pp.\n[247](sbe0831.htm#page_247)-[358](sbe0857.htm#page_358) supra and notes there.\n\n[392:2](sbe0863.htm#fr_2058) I. e. restraining the mind in the lotus-like\nheart, Nilaka _nth_ a. Cf. as to this, pp. [248](sbe0831.htm#page_248),\n[372](sbe0859.htm#page_372) inter alia.\n\n[392:3](sbe0863.htm#fr_2059) Cf. Gita, [p. 51](sbe0804.htm#page_51). See also\nMaitri-upanishad, p. 176, and Mu _nd_ aka, p. 314.\n\n[392:4](sbe0863.htm#fr_2060) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says, 'The nature of\ntranquillity is this, that in that state you perceive everything to be unreal\nlike what is seen in a dream' Nilaka _nth_ a says, 'The nature of tranquillity\nis this, that in that state the self abides without attachment to the body and\nany external objects, but working within itself as in a dream.' But see on\nthis Ka _th_ a, p. 147.\n\n[392:5](sbe0863.htm#fr_2061) Viz. tranquillity, Nilaka _nth_ a.\n\n[392:6](sbe0863.htm#fr_2062) I. e., says Nilaka _nth_ a, they see all worldly\nobjects past and future. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, 'They see the actions performed\nfor some wealth and so forth.' I am not satisfied with either meaning. Ar _g_\nuna Mi _s_ ra's is besides based on a reading different from that adopted in\nthe text, namely, Parima _n_ a _g_ ah, instead of Pari _n_ ama _g_ ah. I think\n'pari _n_ ama' is the development which, according to the Sa _n_ khya\nphilosophy, produces the universe, and the movements are the actions which\nthat development--namely, here the activity of egoism and its products--\noccasions. Cf. as to some extent supporting this, Sa _n_ khya-sara, p. 16.\n\n[392:7](sbe0863.htm#fr_2063) See inter alia Gita, pp.\n[68](sbe0808.htm#page_68)-[70](sbe0808.htm#page_70).\n\n[393:1](sbe0863.htm#fr_2064) See inter alia Gita, pp.\n[68](sbe0808.htm#page_68)-[70](sbe0808.htm#page_70).\n\n[393:2](sbe0863.htm#fr_2065) I. e., I presume, Bhur and the rest. But see also\n_Kh_ andogya, pp. 212, 541, 620, and B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, pp. 302, 608.\n\n[393:3](sbe0863.htm#fr_2066) See [p. 285](sbe0839.htm#page_285) supra, and cf.\ninter alia _Kh_ andogya, p. 550.\n\n[393:4](sbe0863.htm#fr_2067) e. I, the Kshetrag\xc3\xb1a, am the preceptor, and the\nmind is that which has to be taught. This shows that one's instructor must be\noneself, Nilaka _nth_ a. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says, 'I am the preceptor, the\nmind is the pupil.
