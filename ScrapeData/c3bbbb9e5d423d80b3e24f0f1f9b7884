[1900], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n13:3:8\n\n### EIGHTH BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n#### EXPIATORY OFFERINGS.\n\n13:3:8:11\\. Now, then, of the expiations. If the sacrificial horse were to\ncouple with a mare, let him in addition prepare a milk (oblation) to\nVayu;--Vayu doubtless is the transformer of seeds, for Vayu (the wind) is the\nvital air, and the vital air is the transformer\n\np. 346\n\nof seeds: by means of seed he thus puts seed into it.\n\n13:3:8:22\\. And if disease were to befal it, let him in addition prepare a pap\nto Pushan, for Pushan rules over beasts (cattle); and, indeed, he thereby\ngratifies him who owns cattle and rules over cattle; and it (the horse)\nthereby indeed becomes free from disease.\n\n13:3:8:33\\. And if sickness without (visible) injury 1 were to befal it, let\nhim in addition prepare for (Agni) Vai _s_ vanara a cake on twelve potsherds,\nwith the earth serving for potsherds 2; for Vai _s_ vanara is this (earth): he\nthereby gratifies this (earth), and it (the horse) becomes free from disease.\n\n13:3:8:44\\. And if an eye-disease were to befal it, let him in addition\nprepare a pap to Surya;--the Sun, doubtless, is the eye of creatures, for when\nhe rises everything here moves: by means of the eye (of the world) he thus\nbestows the eye upon it. And as to why it is a pap ( _k_ aru), it is because\nby means of the eye this self (body or mind) moves ( _k_ ar).\n\n13:3:8:55\\. And if it were to die in water, let him in addition prepare a\nbarley pap to Varu _n_ a, for Varu _n_ a seizes him who dies in water: he\nthereby thus gratifies that very deity who seizes it, and, thus gratified, he\napproves his slaughtering another (horse), and he slaughters it as one\napproved by that (deity). And as to why it is (prepared) of barley, it is\nbecause barley belongs to Varu _n_ a.\n\n13:3:8:66\\. And if it were to get lost, let him in addition\n\np. 347\n\nperform an ish _t_ i with three sacrificial dishes--a cake on one potsherd for\nHeaven and Earth, a milk (oblation) for Vayu, and a pap for Surya;--for\nwhatsoever is lost, is lost within heaven and earth; and the wind blows upon\nit, and the sun shines upon it; and nothing whatever is lost out of (the reach\nof) these deities. And even by itself 1 this (ish _t_ i) is the recoverer of\nwhat is lost; and even if any other thing of his were to get lost let him\nperform this very offering, and he verily finds it. And if enemies were to\nobtain the horse, or if it were to die (either in any other way) or in water\n2, let them bring another (horse) and consecrate it by sprinkling: this,\nindeed, is the expiation in that case.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[346:1](sbe44101.htm#fr_887) Viz. such as fever, comm.\n\n[346:2](sbe44101.htm#fr_888) That is, spreading them on the earth, or on clods\nof earth, comm.\n\n[347:1](sbe44101.htm#fr_889) That is, even independently of the horse-\nsacrifice.\n\n[347:2](sbe44101.htm#fr_890) That is to say, if it were to die by getting\ndrowned, or in any other way.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 4, 1.
