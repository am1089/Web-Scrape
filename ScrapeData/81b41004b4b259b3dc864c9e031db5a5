And if you maintain that the text does speak (of the pradhana as an object\nof knowledge) we deny that; for the intelligent (highest) Self is meant, on\naccount of the general subject-matter.\n\nHere the Sa _n_ khya raises a new objection, and maintains that the averment\nmade in the last Sutra is not proved, since the text later on speaks of the\npradhana--which had been referred to as the Undeveloped--as an object of\nknowledge. 'He who has perceived that which is without sound, without touch,\nwithout form, without decay, without taste, eternal, without smell, without\nbeginning, without end, beyond the great and unchangeable, is freed from the\njaws of death' (Ka. Up. II, 3, 15). For here the text speaks of the pradhana,\n\np. 247\n\nwhich is beyond the great, describing it as possessing the same qualities\nwhich the Sa _n_ khya-sm _ri_ ti ascribes to it, and designating it as the\nobject of perception. Hence we conclude that the pradhana is denoted by the\nterm avyakta.\n\nTo this we reply that the passage last quoted does represent as the object of\nperception not the pradhana but the intelligent, i.e. the highest Self. We\nconclude this from the general subject-matter. For that the highest Self\ncontinues to form the subject-matter is clear from the following reasons. In\nthe first place, it is referred to in the passage, 'Beyond the person there is\nnothing, this is the goal, the highest Road;' it has further to be supplied as\nthe object of knowledge in the passage, 'The Self is hidden in all beings and\ndoes not shine forth,' because it is there spoken of as difficult to know;\nafter that the restraint of passion, &c. is enjoined as conducive to its\ncognition, in the passage, 'A wise man should keep down speech within the\nmind;' and, finally, release from the jaws of death is declared to be the\nfruit of its knowledge. The Sa _n_ khyas, on the other hand, do not suppose\nthat a man is freed from the jaws of death merely by perceiving the pradhana,\nbut connect that result rather with the cognition of the intelligent Self.--\nThe highest Self is, moreover, spoken of in all Vedanta-texts as possessing\njust those qualities which are mentioned in the passage quoted above, viz.\nabsence of sound, and the like. Hence it follows, that the pradhana is in the\ntext neither spoken of as the object of knowledge nor denoted by the term\navyakta.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4, 6](sbe34117.htm)\n\n"
