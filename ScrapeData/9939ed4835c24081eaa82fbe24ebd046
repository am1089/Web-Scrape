Pra _g_ apati assigned the sacrifices to the gods; the A _s_\nvamedha he kept for himself. The gods\n\np. 296\n\nsaid to him, 'Surely, this--to wit, the A _s_ vamedha--is a sacrifice: let us\nhave a share in that also.' He contrived these Anna-homas (food-oblations) for\nthem: thus when he performs the Annahomas, it is the gods he thereby\ngratifies.\n\n13:2:1:22\\. With ghee he makes offering, for ghee is fiery mettle: by means of\nfiery mettle he thus lays fiery mettle into him (the horse and Sacrificer).\nWith ghee he offers; for that--to wit, ghee--is the gods' favourite resource:\nit is thus with their favourite resource he supplies them.\n\n13:2:1:33\\. With parched groats he makes offering; for that--to wit, parched\ngroats--are a form of the gods 1: it is the gods he thus gratifies.\n\n13:2:1:44\\. With grain he makes offering; for this--to wit, grain--is a form\nof the days and nights 2: it is the days and nights he thus gratifies.\n\n13:2:1:55\\. With parched grain he makes offering; for this--to wit, parched\ngrain--is a form of the Nakshatras 3 (lunar asterisms): it is the Nakshatras\n\np. 297\n\nhe thus gratifies. He offers whilst mentioning names, with (Va _g_. XXII,\n23-33), 'To the in- (and out-) breathing hail! to the off-breathing hail 1!' .\n. . he thus gratifies them by mentioning their names. [Va _g_. S. XXII, 34],\n'To one hail! to two hail! . . . to a hundred hail! to a hundred and one\nhail!' He offers in the proper order: in the proper order he thus gratifies\nthem (the gods). He performs oblations successively increasing by one 2, for\nsingle, indeed, is heaven: singly he thus causes him (the Sacrificer) to reach\nheaven. Straight away 3 he offers in order to the winning of heaven; for\nstraight away, as it were, is heaven.\n\n13:2:1:66\\. But, verily, he who offers the oblations straight\n\np. 298\n\naway 1, is liable to fall (pass) right away. He does not go beyond a hundred\nand one: were he to go beyond a hundred and one, he would deprive the\nSacrificer of his vital power. He offers a hundred and one, for man has a life\nof a hundred (years), and his own self is the one hundred and first: he thus\nestablishes himself in a self (or body), in vital power. With 'To the Dawn\nhail! to Heaven hail!' he offers the two last oblations; for the dawn is the\nnight, and heaven (the realm of light) is the day: it is day and night he thus\ngratifies.\n\n13:2:1:77\\. As to this they say, 'Were he to offer both either by day or by\nnight, he would confound day and night with one another 2.' With 'To the Dawn\nhail!' he offers before the sun has risen, and with 'To Heaven hail' when it\nhas risen, to avoid confusion between day and night.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[295:2](sbe44083.htm#fr_747) There are three Sutyas, or Soma-days, at the A\n_s_ vamedha--viz. an Agnish _t_ oma, an Ukthya, and an Atiratra--the most\nimportant p. 296 of which is the central day. The first day offers no special\nfeatures, as compared with the ordinary Agnish _t_ oma; except that the\nstotras are chanted on the ' _k_ atush _t_ oma' model (see note to [XIII, 3,\n1, 4](sbe44094.htm#13:3:1:4)); and that the animal sacrifice of this day\nrequires twenty-one sacrificial stakes, with twice eleven victims, two of\nwhich are tied to the central stake; see note on [XIII, 2, 5,\n2](sbe44087.htm#13:2:5:2). The offerings referred to in the present Brahma _n_\na, are performed, not during the day itself, but during the following night,\nas a preliminary to the important features of the second Soma-day.\n\n[296:1](sbe44083.htm#fr_748) Viz., according to the commentary, because of the\n(particles of) groats being connected with each other.\n\n[296:2](sbe44083.htm#fr_749) The commentary does not explain this comparison.\nIt would seem to suit better the parched grain.\n\n[296:3](sbe44083.htm#fr_750) Viz. on account of the capability (samarthatvat)\nof the (raw) grains; but whether this is meant to refer to their power of\ngerminating and growing is not explained.\n\n[297:1](sbe44083.htm#fr_751) These eleven anuvakas consist of altogether 149\nsuch short dedicatory formulas--addressed to the vital airs, the regions, the\nwaters, wind, fire, &c.--each ending with 'svaha (hail).' These are followed,\nin anuvaka 34, by formulas addressed to the cardinal numbers from 1 to 101;\nsucceeded by two formulas addressed to the dawn and to heaven respectively,--\nall of these again ending with 'svaha.' The Annahomas themselves, offered by\nthe Adhvaryu's assistant, the Pratiprasthat _ri_ , are not, however, limited\nto any number; but their performance is to be continued throughout the night\nin such a way that each of the four three-hours' watches of the night is to be\ntaken up with as many oblations of one of the four kinds of offering materials\n--in the order in which they are enumerated in the text--as can be got into\nthe space of three hours. The formulas addressed to the cardinal\nnumbers--(which are on no account to extend beyond 101)--are apparently\nsupposed amply to suffice to fill up the time till dawn, when the Adhvaryu\nmakes an oblation of ghee to the Dawn, followed by one to Heaven (or the realm\nof light) after sunrise.\n\n[297:2](sbe44083.htm#fr_752) That is, in offering with the formulas addressed\nto the cardinal numbers.\n\n[297:3](sbe44083.htm#fr_753) That is to say, without repeating any formula, or\ncommencing again from the beginning, when the whole series is exhausted.\n\n[298:1](sbe44083.htm#fr_754) That is, without stopping.\n\n[298:2](sbe44083.htm#fr_755) There is no 'iti' here; and the quotation,\ntherefore, may perhaps extend to the end of the paragraph.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 2, 2.
