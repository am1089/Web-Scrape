Dutt\n\n## (1899)\n\n# EPIC OF RAMA, PRINCE OF INDIA\n\n# BOOK I\n\n# SITA-SWAYAWARA\n\n_\n\n(The Bridal of Sita)\n\n_\n\nTHE Epic relates to the ancient traditions of two powerful races, the Kosalas\nand the Videhas, who lived in Northern India between the twelfth and tenth\ncenturies before Christ. The names Kosala and Videha in the singular number\nindicate the kingdoms,--Oudh and North Behar,--and in the plural number they\nmean the ancient races which inhabited those two countries.\n\nAccording to the Epic, Dasa-ratha king of the Kosalas had four sons, the\neldest of whom was Rama the hero of the poem. And Janak king of the Videhas\nhad a daughter named Sita, who was miraculously born of a field furrow, and\nwho is the heroine of the Epic.\n\nJanak ordained a severe test for the hand of his daughter, and many a prince\nand warrior came and went away disappointed. Rama succeeded, and won Sita. The\nstory of Rama\'s winning his bride, and of the marriage of his three brothers\nwith the sister and cousins of Sita, forms the subject of this Book.\n\nThe portions translated in this Book form Section vi., Sections  \n1xvii. to Ixix., Section lxxiii., and Section lxxvii. of Book i. of  \nthe original text.\n\n## I\n\n## AYODRYA, THE RIGHTEOUS CITY\n\nRich in royal worth and valour, rich in holy Vedic lore,  \nDasa-ratha ruled his empire in the happy days of yore,\n\nLoved of men in fair Ayodhya, sprung of ancient Solar Race,  \nRoyal rishi in his duty, saintly rishi in his grace,\n\nGreat as INDRA in his prowess, bounteous as KUVERA kind,  \nDauntless deeds subdued his foemen, lofty faith subdued his mind!\n\nLike the ancient monarch Manu, father of the human race,  \nDasa-ratha ruled his people with a father\'s loving grace,\n\nTruth and Justice swayed each action and each baser motive quelled  \nPeople\'s Love and Monarch\'s Duty every thought and deed impelled,\n\nAnd his town like INDRA\'S city,--tower and dome and turret brave--  \nRose in proud and peerless beauty on Sarayu\'s limpid wave!\n\nPeaceful lived the righteous people, rich in wealth in merit high,  \nEnvy dwelt not in their bosoms and their accents shaped no lie,\n\nFathers with their happy households owned their cattle, corn, and gold,  \nGalling penury and famine in Ayodhya had no hold,\n\nNeighbours lived in mutual kindness helpful with their ample wealth,  \nNone who begged the wasted refuse, none who lived by fraud and stealth!\n\nAnd they wore the gem and earring, wreath and fragrant sandal paste,  \nAnd their arms were decked with bracelets, and their necks with _nishkas_\ngraced,\n\nCheat and braggart and deceiver lived not in the ancient town,  \nProud despiser of the lowly wore not insults in their frown,\n\nPoorer fed not on the richer, hireling friend upon the great,  \nNone with low and lying accents did upon the proud man wait\n\nMen to plighted vows were faithful, faithful was each loving wife,  \nImpure thought and wandering fancy stained not holy wedded life,\n\nRobed in gold and graceful garments, fair in form and fair in face,  \nWinsome were Ayodhya\'s daughters, rich in wit and woman\'s grace\n\nTwice-born men were free from passion, lust of gold and impure greed,  \nFaithful to their Rites and Scriptures, truthful in their word and deed,\n\nAltar blazed in every mansion, from each home was bounty given,  \n\'Stooped no man to fulsome falsehood, questioned none the will of Heaven.\n\nKshatras bowed to holy Brahmans, Vaisyas to the Kshatras bowed  \nToiling Sudras lived by labour, of their honest duty proud,\n\nTo the Gods and to the Fathers, to each guest in virtue trained,  \nRites were done with true devotion as by holy writ ordained,\n\nPure each caste in due observance, stainless was each ancient rite,  \nAnd the nation thrived and prospered by its old and matchless might,\n\nAnd each man in truth abiding lived a long and peaceful life,  \nWith his sons and with his grandsons, with his loved and honoured wife.\n\nThus was ruled the ancient city by her monarch true and bold,  \nAs the earth was ruled by Mann in the misty days of old,\n\nTroops who never turned in battle, fierce as fire and strong and brave,  \nGuarded well her lofty ramparts as the lions guard the cave.\n\nSteeds like INDRA\'S in their swiftness came from far Kamboja\'s land,  \nFrom Vanaya and Vahlika and from Sindhu\'s rock-bound strand,\n\nElephants of mighty stature from the Vindhya mountains came,  \nOr from deep and darksome forests round Himalay\'s peaks of fame,\n\nMatchless in their mighty prowess, peerless in their wondrous speed,  \nNobler than the noble tuskers sprung from high celestial breed.\n\nThus Ayodhya, "virgin city,"--faithful to her haughty name,--  \nRuled by righteous Dasa-ratha won a world-embracing fame,\n\nStrong-barred gates and lofty arches, tower and dome and turret high  \nDecked the vast and peopled city fair as mansions of the sky.\n\nQueens of proud and peerless beauty born of houses rich in fame,  \nLoved of royal Dasa-ratha to his happy mansion came,\n\nQueen Kausalya blessed with virtue true and righteous Rama bore,  \nQueen Kaikeyi young and beauteous bore him Bharat rich in lore,\n\nQueen Simitra bore the bright twins, Lakshman and Satruglina bold,  \nFour brave princes served their father in the happy days of old!\n\n## II\n\n## MITHILA, AND THE BREAKING OF THE BOW\n\nJanak monarch of Videha spake his memage near and far,  \nHe shall win my peerless Sita who shall bend my bow of war,\n\nSuitors came from farthest regions, warlike princes known to fame,  \nVainly strove to wield the weapon, left Videha in their shame.\n\nViswa-mitra royal _rishi_ , Rama true and Lakshman bold,  \nCame to fair Mithila\'s city from Ayodhya famed of old,\n\nSpake in pride the royal _rishi_ : "Monarch of Videha\'s throne,  \nGrant, the wondrous bow of RUDRA be to princely Rama shown."\n\nJanak spake his royal mandate to his lords and warriors bold:  \n"Bring ye forth the bow of RUDRA decked in garlands and in gold,"\n\nAnd his peers and proud retainers waiting on the monarch\'s call,  \nBrought the great and goodly weapon from the city\'s inner hall.\n\nStalwart men of ample stature pulled the mighty iron car  \nIn which rested all-inviolate Janak\'s dreaded bow of war,\n\nAnd where midst assembled monarchs sat Videha\'s godlike king,  \nWith a mighty toil and effort did the eight-wheeled chariot bring.\n\n"This the weapon of Videha," proudly thus the peers begun,  \n"Be it shewn to royal Rama, Dasa-ratha\'s righteous son,"\n\n"This the bow," then spake the monarch to the risha famed of old,  \nTo the true and righteous Rama and to Lakshman young and bold,\n\n"This the weapon of my fathers prized by kings from age to age,  \nMighty chiefs and sturdy warriors could not bend it, noble sage\n\nGods before the bow of RUDRA have in righteous terror quailed,  \n_Rakshas_ fierce and stout Asuras have in futile effort failed,\n\nMortal man will struggle vainly RUDRA\'S wondrous bow to bend,  \nVainly strive to string the weapon and the shining dart to send,\n\nHoly saint and royal rishi, here is Janak\'s ancient bow,  \nShew it to Ayodhya\'s princes, speak to them my kingly vow!\n\nViswa-mitra humbly listened to the words the monarch said,  \nTo the brave and righteous Rama, Janak\'s mighty bow displayed,\n\nRama lifted high the cover of the pond\'rous iron car,  \nGazed with conscious pride and prowess on the mighty bow of war.\n\n"Let me," humbly spake the hero, "on this bow my fingers place,  \nLet me lift and bend the weapon, help me with your loving grace."\n\n"Be it so," the rishi answered, "be it so," the monarch said,  \nRama lifted high the weapon on his stalwart arms displayed,\n\nWond\'ring gazed the kings assembled as the son of Raghu\'s race  \nProudly raised the bow of RUDRA with a warrior\'s stately grace,\n\nProudly strung the bow Of RUDRA which the kings had tried in vain  \nDrew the cord with force resistless till the weapon snapped in twain!\n\nLike the thunder\'s pealing accent rose the loud terrific clang,  \nAnd the firm earth shook and trembled and the hills in echoes rang,\n\nAnd the chiefs and gathered monarchs fell and fainted in their fear,  \nAnd the men of many nations shook the dreadful sound to hear!\n\nPale and white the startled monarchs slowly from their terror woke,  \nAnd with royal grace and greetings Janak to the _rishi_ spoke:\n\nNow my ancient eyes have witnessed wond\'rous deed by Rama done,  \nDeed surpassing thought or fancy wrought by Dasa-ratha\'s son,\n\nAnd the proud and peerless princess, Sita glory of my house,  \nSheds on me an added lustre as she weds a godlike spouse,\n\nTrue shall be my plighted promise, Sita dearer than my life,  \nWon by worth and wond\'rous valour shall be Rama\'s faithful wife\n\nGrant us leave, O royal rishi, grant us blessings kind and fair,  \nEnvoys mounted on my chariot to Ayodhya shall repair,\n\nThey shall speak to Rama\'s father glorious feat by Rama done,  \nThey shall speak to Dasa-ratha, Sita is by valour won,\n\nThey shall say the noble princes safely live within our walls,  \nThey shall ask him by his presence to adorn our palace balls\n\nPleased at heart the sage assented, envoys by the monarch sent,  \nTo Ayodhya\'s distant city with the royal message went.\n\n## III\n\n## THE EMBASSY TO AYODHYA\n\nThree nights halting in their journey with their steeds fatigued and spent,  \nEnvoys from Mithila\'s monarch to Ayodhya\'s city went,\n\nAnd by royal mandate bidden stepped within the palace hall.  \nWhere the ancient Dasa-ratha sat with peers and courtiers all,\n\nAnd with greetings and obeisance spake their message calm and bold,  \nSoftly fell their gentle accents as their happy tale they told.\n\nGreetings to thee, mighty monarch, greetings to each priest and peer,  \nWishes for thy health and safety from Videha\'s king we bear,\n\nJanak monarch of Videha for thy happy life hath prayed,  \nAnd by Viswa-mitra\'s bidding words of gladsome message said:\n\n\'Known on earth my plighted promise, spoke by heralds near and far,  \nHe shall win my peerless Sita who shall bend my bow of war,--\n\nMonarchs came and princely suitors, chiefs and warriors known to fame,  \nBaffled in their fruitless effort left Mithila in their shame,\n\nRama came with gallant Lakshman by their proud preceptor led,  \nBent and broke the mighty weapon, he the beauteous bride shall wed!\n\nRama strained the weapon stoutly till it snapped and broke in twain,  \nIn the concourse of the monarchs, in the throng of armed men,\n\nRama wins the peerless princess by the righteous will of Heaven,  \nI redeem my plighted promise-be thy kind permission given!\n\nMonarch of Kosala\'s country! with each lord and peer and priest,  \nWelcome to Mithila\'s city, welcome to Videha\'s feast,\n\nJoy thee in thy Rama\'s triumph, joy thee with a father\'s pride,  \nLet each prince of proud Kosala win a fair Videha-bride!\'\n\nThese by Viswa-mitra\'s bidding are the words our monarch said  \nThis by Sata-nanda\'s counsel is the quest that he hath made."\n\nJoyful was Kosala\'s monarch, spake to chieftains in the hall,  \nVama-deva and Vasishtha and to priests and Brahmans all:\n\n"Priests and peers! in far Mithila, so these friendly envoys tell,  \nRighteous Rama, gallant Lakshman, in the royal palace dwell,\n\nAnd our brother of Videha prizes Rama\'s warlike pride,  \nTo each prince of proud Kosala yields a fair Videha-bride,\n\nIf it please ye, priests and chieftains, speed we to Mithila fair,  \nWorld-renowned is Janak\'s virtue, Heaven-inspired his learning rare!"\n\nSpake each peer and holy Brahman: "Dasa-ratha\'s will be done!"  \nSpake the king unto the envoys: "Part we with the rising sun!"\n\nHonoured with a regal honour, welcomed to a rich repast,  \nGifted envoys from Mithila day and night in gladness passed!\n\n## IV\n\n## MEETING OF JANAK AND DASA-RATHA\n\nOn Ayodhya\'s tower and turret now the golden morning woke,  \nDasa-ratha girt by courtiers thus to wise Sumantra spoke:\n\nBid the keepers of my treasure with their waggons lead the way,  \nRide in front with royal riches, gold and gems in bright array,\n\nBid my warriors skilled in duty lead the four-fold ranks of war,  \nElephants and noble chargers, serried foot and battle-car,\n\nBid my faithful chariot-driver harness quick each car of state,  \nWith the fleetest of my coursers, and upon my orders wait.\n\nVama-deva and Vasishtha versed in Veda\'s ancient lore,  \nKasyapa and good Jabali sprung from holy saints of yore,\n\nMarkandeya in his glory, Katyayana in his pride,  \nLet each priest and proud preceptor with Kosala\'s monarch ride,\n\nHarness to my royal chariot strong and stately steeds of war,  \nFor the envoys speed my journey and the way is long and far."\n\nWith each priest and proud retainer Dasa-ratha led the way,  \nGlittering ranks of forces followed in their four-fold dread array,\n\nFour days on the way they journeyed till they reached Videha\'s land,  \nJanak with a courteous welcome came to greet the royal band,\n\nJoyously Videha\'s monarch greeted every priest and peer,  \nGreeted ancient Dasa-ratha in his accents soft and clear:\n\n"Hast thou come, my royal brother, on my house to yield thy grace,  \nHast thou made a peaceful journey, pride of Raghu\'s royal race?\n\nWelcome! for Mithila\'s people seek my royal guest to greet,  \nWelcome! for thy sons of valour long their loving sire to meet,\n\nWelcome to the priest Vasishtha versed in Veda\'s ancient lore,  \nWelcome every righteous rishi sprung from holy saints of yore!\n\nAnd my evil fates are vanquished and my race is sanctified,  \nWith the warlike race of Raghu thus in loving bonds allied,\n\nSacrifice and rites auspicious we ordain with rising sun,  \nEre the evening\'s darkness closes, happy nuptials shall be done!"\n\nThus in kind and courteous accents Janak spake his purpose high,  \nAnd his royal love responding, Dasa-ratha made reply:\n\n"Gift betokens giver\'s bounty, so our ancient sages sing,  \nAnd thy righteous fame and virtue grace thy gift, Videha\'s king!\n\nWorld-renowmed is Janak\'s bounty, Heaven-inspired his holy grace,  \nAnd we take his boon and blessina as an honour to our race!"\n\nRoyal grace and kingly greeting, marked the ancient monarch\'s word,  \nJanak with a grateful pleasure Dasa-ratha\'s answer heard,\n\nAnd the Brahmans and preceptors joyously the midnight spent,  \nAnd in converse pure and pleasant and in sacred sweet content.\n\nRigliteous Rama, gallant Lakshman piously their father greet,  \nDuly make their deep obeisance, humbly touch his royal feet,\n\nAnd the night is filled with gladness for the king revered and old,  \nHonoured by the saintly Janak, greeted by his children bold,\n\nOn Mithila\'s tower and turret stars their silent vigils keep,  \nWhen each sacred rite completed, Janak seeks his nightly sleep.\n\n## V\n\n## THE PREPARATION\n\nAll his four heroic princes now with Dasa-ratha stayed  \nIn Mithila\'s ancient city, and their father\'s will obeyed,\n\nThither came the bold Yudhajit prince of proud Kaikeya\'s line,  \nOn the day that Dasa-ratha made his gifts of gold and kine,\n\nAnd he met the ancient monarch, for his health and safety prayed,  \nMade his bow and due obeisance and in gentle accents said:\n\n"List, O king! my royal father, monarch of Kaikeya\'s race,  \nSends his kindly love and greetings with his blessings and his grace,\n\nAnd he asks if Dasa-ratha prospers in his wonted health,  \nIf his friends and fond relations live in happiness and wealth.\n\nQueen Kaikeyi is my sister, and to see her son I came,  \nBharat prince of peerless virtue, worthy of his father\'s fame,\n\nAye, to see that youth of valour, by my royal father sent,  \nTo Ayodhya\'s ancient city with an anxious heart I went,\n\nIn the city of Mithila,--thus did all thy subjects say,  \nWith his sons and with his kinsmen Dasa-ratha makes his stay,\n\nHence in haste I journeyed hither, travelling late and early dawn,  \nFor to do thee due obeisance and to greet my sister\'s son!"\n\nSpake the young and proud Kaikeya, dear and duly-greeted guest,  \nDasa-ratha on his brother choicest gifts and honours pressed.\n\nBrightly dawned the happy morning, and Kosala\'s king of fame  \nWith his sons and wise Vasishtha to the sacred _yajna_ came,\n\nRama and his gallant brothers decked in gem and jewel bright,  \nIn th\' auspicious hour of morning did the blest _Kautuka_ rite,\n\nAnd beside their royal father piously the princes stood,  \nAnd to fair Videlia\'s monarch spake Vasishtha wise and good:\n\n"Dasa-ratha waits expectant with each proud and princely son,  \nWaits upon the bounteous giver, for each holy rite is done,\n\n\'Twixt the giver and the taker sacred word is sacred deed,  \nSeal with gift thy plighted promise, let the nuptial rites proceed\n\nThus the righteous-souled Vasishtha to Videha\'s monarch prayed,  \nJanak versed in holy Vedas thus in courteous accents said:\n\n"Wherefore waits the king expectant? Free to him this royal dome,  \nSince my kingdom is his empire and my palace is his home,\n\nAnd the maidens, flame-resplendent, done each fond _Kautuka_ rite,  \nBeaming in their bridal beauty tread the sacrificial site\n\nI beside the lighted altar wait upon thy sacred hest,  \nAnd auspicious is the moment, sage Vasishtha knows the rest\n\nLet the peerless Dasa-ratha, proud Kosala\'s king of might,  \nWith his sons and honoured sages enter on the holy site,\n\nLet the righteous sage Vasishtha, sprung from Vedic saints of old,  \nCelebrate the happy wedding; be the sacred _mantras_ told!"\n\n## VI\n\n## THE WEDDING\n\nSage Vasishtha skilled in duty placed Videha\'s honoured king,  \nViswa-mitra, Sata-nanda, all within the sacred ring,\n\nAnd he raised the holy altar as the ancient writs ordain,  \nDecked and graced with scented garlands grateful unto gods and men,\n\nAnd he set the golden ladles, vases pierced by artists skilled,  \nHoly censers fresh and fragrant, cups with sacred honey filled,\n\n_\n\nSanka_ bowls and shining salvers, _arghya_ plates for honoured guest,  \nParched rice arranged in dishes, corn unhusked that filled the rest,\n\nAnd with careful hand Vasishtha grass around the altar flung,  \nOffered gift to lighted AGNI and the sacred mantra sung!\n\nSoftly came the sweet-eyed Sita,--bridal blush upon her brow,  \nRama in his manly beauty came to take the sacred vow,\n\nJanak placed his beauteous daughter facing Dasa-ratha\'s soil,  \nSpake with father\'s fond emotion and the holy rite was done:\n\n_\n\n"This is Sita child of Janak, dearer unto him than life,  \nHenceforth sharer of thy virtue, be. she, prince, thy faithful wife,\n\nOf thy weal and woe partaker, be she thine in every land,  \nCherish her in joy and sorrow, clasp her hand within thy hand,\n\nAs the shadow to the substance, to her lord is faithful wife,  \nAnd my Sita best of women follows thee in death or life!"\n\n_\n\nTears bedew his ancient bosom, gods and men his wishes share,  \nAnd he sprinkles holy water on the blest and wedded pair.\n\nNext he turned to Sita\'s sister, Urmila of beauty rare,  \nAnd to Lakshman young and valiant spake in accents soft and fair:\n\n_\n\nLakshman, dauntless in thy duty, loved of men and Gods above,  \nTake my dear devoted daughter, Urmila of stainless love,\n\nLakshman, fearless in thy virtue, take thy true and faithful wife,  \nClasp her hand within thy fingers, be she thine in death or life!"\n\n_\n\nTo his brother\'s child Mandavi, Janak turned with father\'s love,  \nYielded her to righteous Bharat, prayed for blessings from above:\n\n_\n\n"Bharat, take the fair Mandavi, be she thine in death or life,  \nClasp her hand within thy fingers as thy true and faithful wife!"\n\n_\n\nLast of all was Sruta-kriti, fair in form and fair in face,  \nAnd her gentle name was honoured for her acts of righteous grace,\n\n_\n\n"Take her by the hand, Satrughna, be she thine in death or life,  \nAs the shadow to the suistance, to her lord is faithful wife!"\n\n_\n\nThen the princes held the maidens, hand embraced in loving hand,  \nAnd Vasishtha spake the _mantra_ , holiest priest in all the land,\n\nAnd as ancient rite ordaineth, and as sacred laws require,  \nStepped each bride and princely bridegroom round the altar\'s lighted fire,\n\nRound Videha\'s ancient monarch, round the holy rishis all,  \nUghtly stepped the gentle maidens, proudly stepped the princes tall!\n\nAnd a rain of flowers descended from the sky serene and fair,  \nAnd a soft celestial music filled the fresh and fragrant air,\n\nBright _Gandkarvas_ skilled in music waked the sweet celestial song  \nFair _Apsaras_ in their beauty on the greensward tripped along!\n\nAs the flowery rain descended and the music rose in pride,  \nThrice around the lighted altar every bridegroom led his bride,\n\nAnd the nuptial rites were ended, princes took their brides away,  \nJanak followed with his courtiers, and the town was proud and gay!\n\n## VII\n\n## RETURN TO AYODRYA\n\nWith his wedded sons and daughters and his guard in bright array,  \nTo the famed and fair Ayodhya, Dasa-ratha held his way,\n\nAnd they reached the ancient city decked with banners bright and brave,  \nAnd the voice of drum and trumpet hailed the home-returning brave.\n\nFragrant blossoms strewed the pathway, song of welcome filled the air,  \nJoyous men and merry women issued forth in garments fair,\n\nAnd they lifted up their faces and they waved their hands on high,  \nAnd they raised the voice of welcome as their righteous king drew nigh.\n\nGreeted by his loving subjects, welcomed by his priests of fame,  \nDasa-ratha, with the princes to his happy city came,\n\nWith the brides and stately princes in the town he held his way,  \nEntered slow his lofty palace bright as peak of Himalay.\n\nQueen Kausalya blessed with virtue, Queen Kaikeyi in her pride,  \nQueen Sumitra sweetly loving, greeted every happy bride,\n\nSoft-eyed Sita noble-destined, Urmila of spotless fame,  \nMandavi and Sruta-kirti to their loving mothers came.\n\nDecked in silk and queenly garments they performed each pious rite,  \nBrought their blessings on the household, bowed to Gods of holy might,\n\nBowed to all the honoured elders, blest the children with their love,  \nAnd with soft and sweet endearment by their loving consorts moved.\n\nHappy were the wedded princes peerless in their warlike might,  \nAnd they dwelt in stately mansions like KUVERA\'S mansions bright.\n\nLoving wife and troops of kinsmen, wealth and glory on them wait,  \nFilial love and fond affection sanctify their happy fate.\n\nOnce when on the palace chambers bright the golden morning woke,  \nTo his son the gentle Bharat, thus the ancient monarch spoke:\n\n"Know, my son, the prince Kaikeya, Yudajit of warlike fame,  \nQueen Kaikeyi\'s honoured brother, from his distant regions came,\n\nHe hath come to take thee, Bharat, to Kaikeya\'s monarch bold,  \nGo and stay with them a season, greet thy grandsire loved of old."\n\nBharat heard with filial duty and he hastened to obey,  \nTook with him the young Satrughna in his grandsire\'s home to stay,\n\nAnd from Rama and from Lakshman parted they with many a tear,  \nFrom their young and gentle consorts, from their parents ever dear,\n\nAnd Kaikeya with the princes, with his guards and troopers gay,  \nTo his father\'s western regions gladsome held his onward way.\n\nRama with a pious duty,--favoured by the Gods above,--  \nTended still his ancient father with a never-faltering love,\n\nIn his father\'s sacred mandate still his noblest Duty saw,  \nIn the weal of subject nations recognised his foremost Law!\n\nAnd he pleased his happy mother with a fond and filial care,  \nAnd his elders and his kinsmen with devotion soft and fair,\n\nBrahmans blessed the righteous Rama for his faith in gods above,  \nPeople in the town and hamlet blessed him with their loyal love!\n\nWith a woman\'s whole affection fond and trusting Sita loved,  \nAnd within her faithful bosom loving Rama lived and moved,\n\nAnd he loved her, for their parents chose her as his faithful wife,  \nLoved her for her peerless beauty, for her true and trustful life,\n\nLoved and dwelt within her bosom though he wore a form apart,  \nRama in a sweet communion lived in Sita\'s loving heart!\n\nDays of joy and months of gladness o\'er the gentle Sita flew,  \nAs she like the QUEEN OF BEAUTY brighter in her graces grew,\n\nAnd as VISHNU with his consort dwells in skies, alone, apart,  \nRama in a sweet communion lived in Sita\'s loving heart!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book II: The Banishment](rama02.htm)\n\n'
