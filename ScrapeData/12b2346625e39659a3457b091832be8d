How can Maya of this sort cease?--To him who thus asks, Devotion to Isvara\nIs taught as the means to that end.\n\n#### Devotion to Isvara in His visible forms.\n\n2\\. Of the thirty-six _tattvas_ or principles which are the bodies of\nParamesvara, the eight forms are immediately perceived by all.\n\nFor the thirty-six principles enumerated in the Saiva-Agamas, see chapter, II,\n31-42.\n\n3\\. Inasmuch as manas cannot readily ascend to incomprehensible matters, the\nGuru teaches the contemplation of Sarvatman, of the Universal Self in the\neight (visible) forms (mentioned in the ninth stanza).\n\np. 161\n\nThe meaning of the ninth stanza may be explained as follows:\n\n#### Unity of Macrocosm and Microcosm.\n\n4\\. In the Brahmanda,--in the body of the Viraj,--as well as in the body of\nman, the aggregate of the thirty-six principles is present everywhere.\n\nThe visible universe is made up of the eight forms mentioned in the ninth\nstanza. The aggregate of the thirty-six principles constitutes the body of\nMahesvara. This, again, is two-fold, the Adhidaiva and the Adhyatma, Cosmic\nand Personal. The. former constitutes Brahmanda, made up of the fourteen\nworlds; and the latter constitutes the _pinda_ , the body of each individual.\nThese two are one, as cause and effect, the one being evolved out of the\nother. The devotee should regard every principle in the individual or\nmicrocosmic body as one with the corresponding principle in the Brahmanda or\nmacrocosm. He should also regard the Soul (Purusha) embodied in the former as\none with the\n\np. 162\n\n[paragraph continues] Soul embodied in the latter. He should then contemplate\nMahes\'vara as the Self (Atman) common to both. When the antah-karana is\nsteadied in the contemplation of the one Atman, the devotee, by the Grace of\nthe Supreme Lord, intuits Him in His essential being, and attains the Supreme\nEnd. This whole process will be detailed below.\n\n5\\. The microcosmic (vyashti) manas pervades this microcosmic body. Therefore,\nthe individual body should be regarded as one with the universe.\n\nThe Sruti (Bri. Up. 3-5-13) declares that manas, prana and vach of the\nindividual soul are infinite in space and time, _i.e._ , are one with the\nHiranyagarbha, otherwise called Lingatman. The Hiranyagarbha functions chiefly\nin manas and has the Brahmanda for His body, and He may, therefore, be\nregarded as pervading the individual body which has been evolved out of the\nBrahmanda. Thus, as being equally pervaded by Lingatman, the individual body\nmay be looked on as one with the Brahmanda.\n\np. 163\n\n#### Devotion to Isvara in the Microcosm leads to unity with the Macrocosm.\n\n6\\. By contemplating Mahesvara (dwelling) in the microcosm (vyashti), the\ndevotee will become co-extensive with the macrocosm. This the Sruti has\ndeclared ten times in the words "he unites with Atman."\n\nHaving first enumerated the [five](errata.htm#24) kosas (sheaths) of the\nindividual, the Taittiriya-Upanishad (2-8) declares five times that the\ndevotee attains unity with Brahman, dwelling in the anandamaya kosa as the\nbasis of all, in the words " He unites with _annamaya_ Atman; he unites with\n_pranamaya_ Atman; he unites with _manomaya_ Atman; he unites with\n_vijnanamaya_ Atman; he unites with _anandamaya_ Atman." Again, later on, the\nUpanishad speaks of the five kosas in the macrocosm, and at the end (3-10)\ndeclares five times, as shown above, that the devotee attains unity with\nBrahman.\n\n#### Correspondences between Macrocosm and Microcosm.\n\nNow the Vartikakara teaches how to see the macrocosm in the microcosm:\n\np. 164\n\n#### (1) Correspondences as to Earth.\n\n7\\. In the bosom of Brahm\xc4\x81nda, seven worlds such as Bhurloka are said to\nexist. These dwell in the (seven) adharas (in the human body), form Muladhara\nup to Brahmarandhra:\n\nBhuh\n\n|\n\ndwells in\n\n|\n\n Muladhara.  \n  \n---|---|---  \n  \nBhuvah\n\n|\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e\n\n|\n\nSvadhishthana.  \n  \nSvah\n\n|\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e\n\n|\n\nManipuraka.  \n  \nMahah\n\n|\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e\n\n|\n\nAnahata.  \n  \nJanah\n\n|\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e\n\n|\n\nVisuddha.  \n  \nTapah\n\n|\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e\n\n|\n\n\xc3\x82jna  \n  \nSatyam\n\n|\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e\n\n|\n\nSahasrara.  \n  \n8\\. The back-bone is the Mahameru, and the bones near it are the Kulaparvatas.\nThe Ganges is Pingala Nadi, while Ida is said to be Yamuna.\n\np. 165\n\n#### (2) Correspondences as to Waters.\n\n9\\. Sushumna is the Sarasvati, and other nadis the other sacred rivers. The\nseven _dh atus_ are the seven _dv ipas;_ sweat, tears and the like are the\noceans.\n\n#### (3) Correspondences as to Fire or Light.\n\n10\\. In the muladhara dwells the Kalagni, amidst bones is Badaba fire. In\nsushumna lies the fire of lightning, and the earthly fire in the region of the\nnavel.\n\n11\\. In the heart lies the sun-fire; in the skull, the lunar orb; the eye and\nother sense-organs are the other luminaries.\n\n#### (4) Correspondences as to Air.\n\np. 166\n\n12\\. As the worlds are supported by the _pravahana_ and other vayus, so is the\nbody supported by the ten vayus such as prana.\n\n#### Different aspects of prana in the body.\n\n13\\. Starting from the muladhara, _pr ana_ enters Ida and Pingala in the form\nof the sun, and goes out through the nostrils and disappears at a distance of\ntwelve inches.\n\n14\\. Coming as the moon from a distance of eight inches, it (the same prana)\nenters within through the two nadis. As apana (it) throws out the dung, the\nurine, the wind, and the semen.\n\np. 167\n\n15\\. As Agni (Fire) and Soma (Moon) in one, it enters into the cavity of\nSushumna; and rising up to Brahmarandhra, it grows into Udana.\n\n16\\. Vyana spreads every day throughout the body the essence of the food\neaten, while Samana ever kindles the bodily fire.\n\n17\\. Naga produces hiccup; Kurma closes and opens the eye; Krikara causes\nsneezing; Devadatta gives rise to yawning;\n\n18\\. Dhananjaya causes distension and leaves not even the corpse.\n\n#### (5) Correspondences as to akasa.\n\nAkasa affords space within the body as well as without.\n\np. 168\n\nThere is the same akasa both in the microcosm and in the Macrocosm.\n\n#### (6-8) Correspondences as to the Sun, the Moon and the Soul.\n\n19\\. The Sun and the Moon, the regulators of time, are the prana and the apana\nof the embodied beings ( _i.e._ , in the microcosm). The witness (within) is\nthe Purusha (without).\n\nThat is to say, the personal soul in the microcosm corresponds to the cosmic\nsoul, the Hiranyagarbha in the macrocosm.\n\n#### Samanaska Yoga leads to the Amanaska.\n\n20\\. Practising the Samanaska-Yoga--this devotion with manas,--a Yogin,\nperfect in the eight-stepped Yoga, rises to Amanaska (Isvara), to Him who has\nno manas.\n\np. 169\n\n#### The Eight Steps of Yoga.\n\n(1) _Yama_.\n\n21-22\\. Serenity of mind, contentment, silence, restraint of the senses,\nkindness, generosity, faith, straightforwardness, tenderness, patience,\nsincerity, harmlessness, continence, reflection, fortitude, these among others\nare said to be Yamas, forms of self-control to be exercised by the mind.\n\n(2) _Niyama_.\n\n23-24\\. Bathing, cleanliness, worshipping, japa (saying prayers), homa\n(offering oblation), tarpana (propitiating), penance, charity, endurance,\nbowing, pradakshina\n\np. 170\n\n[paragraph continues] (circum-ambulation), austerities, fasting these among\nothers are said to be Niyamas, forms of self-control to be effected through\nthe body.\n\n(3) _A \'sana_.\n\n24-26\\. Svastika, Gomukha, Padma, Hamsa--these are the Brahmic postures\n(Asanas). Nrisimha, Garuda, Kurma, Naga--these are the Vaishnava postures.\nVira, Mayura, Vajra, Siddha--these are the Raudra postures. Yoni is the Sakta\nposture. Paschima-tanaka is the Saiva posture.\n\n_Brahmic_ , etc.: appropriate to the contemplation of Brahma, etc. For a\ndescription of the postures, see works on Yoga.\n\np. 171\n\n26-27\\. The posture for the Niralambana-Yoga, is niralambana (lit. propless,\ninvolving no specific position of hands, feet or other members of the body);\nmeditation should be on the Niralamba, and the Niralamba is Sadasiva, the\nUnconditioned, the Paramatman.\n\n(4) _Pr anayama_.\n\n27\\. Restraint of breath comprises Rechaka (emptying), Puraka (filling in),\nand Kumbhaka (stopping).\n\n(5) _Praty ahara_.\n\n28\\. The restraining of all the sense-organs from their objects is said to be\nPratyahara by those who know the process of pratyahara.\n\n(6) _Dh arana_.\n\n29\\. The fixing of the manas on some object of thought (adhara) is termed\nDharana, concentration.\n\np. 172\n\nThe object of thought may be one of the six _chakras_ in the body, or the\nDivine Being in the form of Vishnu, etc., imaged in the heart.\n\n(7) _Dhy ana_.\n\nMeditation of Brahma, Vishnu, Siva and the like is termed Dhyana.\n\nDharana is the mere fixing of the manas and prana on some object; while Dhyana\nconsists in a continuous stream of thought directed to Vishnu or some such\nobject of thought.\n\n(8) _Sam adhi_.\n\n30\\. Steadiness of buddhi in Dhyana is called Samadhi; while the Amanaska-\nSamadhi is free from all thought (of differentiation).\n\n#### Yoga necessary for steadiness of Manas and Prana.\n\n31\\. When chitta, the thinking principle, attains steadiness, prana becomes\nsteady.\n\np. 173\n\nFor steadiness of chitta, the devotee should practise Yoga with Dhyana.\n\n#### Lambika-Yoga.\n\n32\\. To contract apana, to restrain prana, and to fix the tongue on the uvula,\n--this is a means to Yoga, to the restraining of chitta.\n\n#### Signs of perfection in Yoga.\n\n33\\. When chitta becomes steady and prana is centred within, then, on gaining\ncontrol over the five elements, respectively, the following marks appear:\n\nControl over the five elements (bhutas) may be gained by practising Dharana on\ntheir respective seats in the body. The seat of earth extends from the foot to\nthe knee; the seat of water from the knee to the navel; the seat of fire, from\nthe navel to the throat; the seat of air, from the throat to the region\nbetween the eyebrows; and the seat of akasa, from that region to Brahma-\nrandhra.\n\np. 174\n\n34\\. Small quantity of dung, urine, and phlegm; health and lightness of the\nbody; fine smell, voice, and complexion,--these form the first group of marks\nof Yoga, (marks of control over the earth-element).\n\n35\\. Not to be affected by the tips of thorns, not to become immersed in water\nand mire, power to endure hunger, thirst and the like,--these form the second\ngroup of marks of Yoga, (marks of control over the water-element).\n\n36\\. Power to eat and drink much, to endure sun and fire, to see and hear far,\n--these form the third group of marks\n\np. 175\n\nof Yoga, (marks of control over the fire-element).\n\n37\\. To leap like a frog, to jump over trees like a monkey, to walk in the\nair,--these form the fourth group of marks of Yoga, (marks of control over the\nair-element).\n\n38\\. Knowledge of all times, superhuman powers such as anima, possession of\nendless powers,--these form the fifth group of marks of Yoga, (marks of\ncontrol over the akasa-element).\n\n39\\. When prana reaches sushumna, Nada (sound) of eight sorts is heard within:\nlike the sound of a bell, a drum,\n\np. 176\n\na conch, an ocean, a vina (a musical instrument), a flute, cymbals, etc.\n\n#### Isvara\'s manifestation in Yoga.\n\n40\\. When prana dwells in Brahma-nadi (sushumna), the Divine Being appears in\nforms like those of fire, lightning, stars, the moon and the sun.\n\n#### Manifestation of Pranava in Yoga.\n\n41\\. In each breath the sun runs as many yojanas as there are breathings of a\nman in a day.\n\n42\\. By breaths numbering twenty-one-thousand-and-six-hundred, Atman daily\nrepeats the mantra " _Soham_ , He I am." for the prolongation of life.\n\np. 177\n\n43\\. By omitting _s_ and _h_ , and by merging _a_ in _o_ preceding it, the\nPranava (Om) is formed.\n\n44\\. The wise say that _a_ , _u_ , _m_ , the _bindu_ and the _nada_ are the\nfive aksharas (sounds) of the Pranava.\n\nThe _bindu_ is the nasal vowel-sound, without which the consonant _m_ cannot\nbe sounded. The _nada_ is one with the sonant prana. It starts from Muladhara\nand becomes manifested in the cavity of the nadi through which the heated\nprana passes. The component parts of Pranava being manifested by this nada,\nthe Pranava is said to end with nada. Thus _a_ , _u_ , _m_ , _bindu_ , and\n_nada_ are the five aksharas or sounds residing in Pranava, _i.e._ , in the\nbody of man which is called Pranava.\n\n45\\. Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra, Isvara and Sadasiva,--these dwell in the five\n\np. 178\n\naksharas in conjunction with the thirty-six principles.\n\n#### The Grace of God and Guru necessary.\n\n46\\. By the Guru\'s grace, the devotee attains the eight-stepped Yoga; by\nSiva\'s Grace, he attains perfection in Yoga which is eternal.\n\nPerfection in Yoga consists in the intuitive recognition of the true nature of\nAtman.\n\n47\\. To Him who is Being, Consciousness, and Bliss; who dwells in Bindu and\nNada; who has no beginning, middle or end; to the Guru of the Gurus be this\nbow!\n\nThis explains the meaning of pranava. Existence, Consciousness, and Bliss,\nrepresented [respectively](errata.htm#25) by _a_ , _u_ , _m_ , constitute the\nPranava and form the essential nature of Brahman. Bindu and nada stand for\nname and form, the one standing\n\np. 179\n\nfor the manifested name and form, and the other for the unmanifested name and\nform; so that they show that He is the cause of the origin, continuance and\ndissolution of the universe. They describe Him through His acts, but not as He\nis in Himself.\n\n48\\. Thus ends the ninth chapter in brief in the work called Manasollasa,\nwhich expounds the meaning. of the Hymn to the blessed Dakshinamurti.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter X. Perfection](dast14.htm)\n\n'
