The works of the a _s_ ramas also, on account of their being enjoined.\n\nIt has been said that sacrifices and other works are auxiliary to the\nknowledge of Brahman. The doubt now arises whether those works are to be\nperformed by him also who merely wishes to fulfil the duties of his a _s_\nrama, without aiming at final Release, or not. They are not, the Purvapakshin\nholds, for that things auxiliary to knowledge should stand in subordinate\nrelation to a certain state of life would imply the contradiction of permanent\nand non-permanent obligation.--Of this view the Sutra disposes, 'The works of\nthe a _s_ ramas also.' The works belonging to each a _s_ rama have to be\nperformed by those also who do not aim at more than to live according to the a\n_s_ rama; for they are specifically enjoined by texts such as as long as life\nlasts he is to offer the Agnihotra'; this implies a permanent obligation\ndependent on life. And that the same works are also to be performed as being\nauxiliary to\n\np. 703\n\nknowledge appears from the texts enjoining them in that aspect, 'Him they seek\nto know by the study of the Veda' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 22); this the next Sutra\ndeclares.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 33. And on account of co-operativeness](sbe48480.htm)\n\n"
