Then Bhu _g_ yu Lahyayani asked. 'Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya,' he said, 'we\nwandered about as students 3, and came to the house of Pata _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ala Kapya.\nHe had a daughter who was possessed by a Gandharva. We asked him, 'Who art\nthou?' and he (the Gandharva) replied: 'I am Sudhanvan, the \xc3\x82\xe1\xb9\x85girasa.' And\nwhen we asked him about the ends of the world, we said to him, 'Where were the\nParikshitas 4? Where then were the Parikshitas, I ask thee, Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya, where were the Parikshitas?'\n\n2\\. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: 'He said to thee, I suppose, that they went where\nthose go who have performed a horse-sacrifice.'\n\nHe said: 'And where do they go who have performed a horse-sacrifice?'\n\np. 128\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya replied: 'Thirty-two journeys of the car of the sun is this\nworld. The earth surrounds it on every side, twice as large, and the ocean\nsurrounds this earth on every side, twice as large. Now there is between 1\nthem a space as large as the edge of a razor or the wing of a mosquito. Indra,\nhaving become a bird, handed them (through the space) to Vayu (the air), and\nVayu (the air), holding them within himself, conveyed them to where they dwell\nwho have performed a horse-sacrifice. Somewhat in this way did he praise Vayu\nindeed. Therefore Vayu (air) is everything by itself, and Vayu is all things\ntogether. He who knows this, conquers death.' After that Bhugyu Lahyayani held\nhis peace.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[127:2](sbe15066.htm#fr_397) Madhyandina text, p. 1070.\n\n[127:3](sbe15066.htm#fr_398) The commentator explains _k_ araka _h_ as\nadhyayanartha _m_ vrata _k_ ara _n_ a _k_ _k_ araka _h_ , adhvaryavo va.
