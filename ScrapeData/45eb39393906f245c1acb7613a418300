Praise of the virtues of an amulet derived from the varana-tree.\n\n1\\. Here is my varana-amulet, a bull that destroys the rivals: with it do thou\nclose in upon thy enemies, crush them that desire to injure thee!  \n2\\. Break them, crush them, close in upon them: the amulet shall be thy\nvanguard in front! With the varana the Devas (gods) did ward off (avarayanta)\nthe onslaught of the Asuras (demons) day after day.  \n3, This thousand-eyed, yellow, golden varanaamulet is a universal cure; it\nshall lay low thy enemies: be thou the first to injure those that hate thee!  \n4\\. This varana will ward off (varayishyate) the spell that has been spread\nagainst thee; this will protect thee from human danger, this will protect thee\nfrom all evil!  \n5\\. This divine tree, the varana, shall shut out (varayatai)! The gods, too,\nhave shutout (avivaran) the disease that has entered into this (man).  \n6\\. If when asleep thou shalt behold an evil dream; as often as a wild beast\nshall run an inauspicious course; from (ominous) sneezing, and from the evil\nshriek of a bird, this varana-amulet will protect thee (varayishyate).  \n7\\. From Arati (grudge), Nirriti (misfortune), from sorcery, and from danger;\nfrom death and overstrong weapons the varana will protect thee.  \n8\\. The sin that my mother, that my father, that my brothers and my sister\nhave committed; the sin that we (ourselves) have committed, from that this\ndivine tree will protect us.  \n9\\. Through the varana are confused my enemies and my (rival) kin. To\nuntraversed gloom they have gone: they shall go to the nethermost darkness!  \n10\\. (May) I (be) unharmed, with cows unharmed, long-lived, with undiminished\nmen! This varana-amulet shall guard me in every region (of space)!  \n11\\. This varana upon my breast, the kingly, divine tree, shall smite asunder\nmy enemies, as Indra the Dasyus, the Asuras (demons)!  \n12\\. Long-lived, a hundred autumns old, do I wear this varana: kingdom and\nrule, cattle and strength, this shall bestow upon me!  \n13\\. As the wind breaks with might the trees, the lords of the forest, thus do\nthou break my rivals, those formerly born, and the latter born! The varana\nshall watch over thee!  \n14\\. As the wind and the fire consume the trees, the lords of the forest,\nthus, do thou consume my rivals, those formerly born, and the latter born! The\nvarana shall watch over thee!  \n15\\. As, ruined by the wind, the trees lie prostrate, thus do thou ruin and\nprostrate my rivals, those formerly born, and the latter born! The varana\nshall watch over thee!  \n16\\. Do thou cut off, O varana, before their appointed time and before old\nage, those that aim to injure him in his cattle, and threaten his sovereignty!  \n17\\. As the sun is resplendent, as in him brilliance has been deposited, thus\nshall the amulet of varana hold fast for me reputation and prosperity, shall\nsprinkle me with brilliance, and anoint me with splendour!  \n18\\. As splendour is in the moon, and in the sun, the beholder of men, thus\nshall the amulet of varana hold fast, &c.  \n19\\. As splendour is in the earth, as in this Gatavedas (the fire), thus shall\nthe amulet of varana hold fast, &c.  \n20\\. As splendour is in the maiden, as in this appointed chariot, thus shall\nthe amulet of varana hold fast, &c.  \n21\\. As splendour is in the soma-draught, as splendour is in the honey-mixture\n(for guests), thus shall the amulet of varana hold fast, &c.  \n22\\. As splendour is in the agnihotra-oblation, as splendour is in the call\nvashat, thus shall the amulet of varana hold fast, &c.  \n23\\. As splendour is in the sacrificer, as (splendour) has been deposited in\nthe sacrifice, thus shall the amulet of varana hold fast, &c.  \n24\\. As splendour is in Pragapati, as in this Parameshthin (the lord on high),\nthus shall the amulet of varana hold fast, &c.  \n25\\. As immortality is in the gods, as truth has been deposited in them, thus\nshall the amulet of varana hod fast, &c.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: X, 6.
