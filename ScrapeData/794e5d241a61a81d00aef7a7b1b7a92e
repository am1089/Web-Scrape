But the same, on account of work, remembrance, text, and injunction.\n\nDoes the same person who had gone to sleep rise again at the time of waking,\nor a different one?--Since the soul in deep sleep frees itself from all\nlimiting adjuncts, unites itself with Brahman, and thus being in no way\ndifferent from the released soul, is no longer in any way connected with its\nprevious body, organs, and so on; the person rising from sleep is a different\none.--This view the Sutra sets aside, saying 'but the same.' For there remains\nthe work, i.e. the good and evil deeds previously done by the sleeper, for\nwhich the same person has to undergo retribution before the knowledge of truth\narises. There is next remembrance--'I, the waking person, am the same as I who\nwas asleep.' Scripture also declares this: 'Whatever these creatures are here,\nwhether a lion, or tiger, or wolf, &c., that they become again' ( _Kh_. Up.\nVI, io, 2). And, lastly, the injunctions which enjoin certain acts for the\nsake of final Release would be purportless if the person merged in deep sleep\nattained Release. Nor can it be said that the sleeping soul is free from all\nlimiting adjuncts and manifests itself in its true nature (so as not to be\ndifferent from the released soul). For with regard to the sleeping\n\np. 606\n\nperson the text says,'In truth he thus does not know himself that he is I, nor\ndoes he know anything that exists. He is gone to utter annihilation. I see no\ngood in this' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, ii, 1); while, on the other hand, the texts,\n'Having approached the highest light he manifests himself in his true nature;\nhe moves about there laughing, playing, delighting himself; 'He becomes a\nSelf-ruler; he moves about in all the worlds according to his wish'; 'The\nseeing one sees everything, and attains everything everywhere' ( _Kh_. Up.\nVIII, 12, 3; VII, 25, 2; 26, 2), declare that the released soul is all-\nknowing, and so on. What is true about the sleeping person is that he is still\ncomprised within the Sa _m_ sara, but for the time having put off all\ninstruments of knowledge and action and become incapable of knowledge and\nenjoyment repairs to the place of utter rest, i.e. the highest Self, and\nhaving there refreshed himself, again rises to new enjoyment of action.--Here\nterminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'work, remembrance, text, and injunction.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 10.
