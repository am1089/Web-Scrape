Dutt, [1899], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n# MAHABHARATA BOOK XII\n\n# ASWA-MEDHA\n\n_\n\n(Sacrifice of the Horse)\n\n_\n\nTHE real Epic ends with the war and the funerals of the deceased warriors.\nMuch of what follows in the original Sanscrit poem is either episodical or\ncomparatively recent interpolation. The great and venerable warrior Bhishma,\nstill lying on his death bed, discourses for the instruction of the newly\ncrowned Yudhishthir on various subjects like the Duties of Kings, the Duties\nof the Four Castes, and the Four Stages of Life. He repeats the discourses of\nother saints, of Bhrigu and Bharadwaja, of Manu and Brihaspati, of Vyasa and\nSuka, of Yajnavalkya and Janaka, of Narada and Nairayana. He explains Sankhya\nphilosophy and Yoga philosophy, and lays down the laws of Marriage, the laws\nof Succession, the rules of Gifts, and the rules of Funeral Rites. He preaches\nthe cult of Krishna, and narrates endless legends, tales, traditions, and\nmyths about sages and saints, gods and mortal kings. All this is told in two\nBooks containing about twenty-two thousand couplets, and forming nearly one-\nfourth of the entire Sanscrit Epic!\n\nThe reason of adding all this episodical and comparatively recent matter to\nthe ancient Epic is not far to seek. The Epic became more popular with the\nnation at large than dry codes of law and philosophy, and generations of\nBrahmanical writers laboured therefore to insert in the Epic itself their\nrules of caste and moral conduct, their laws and philosophy. There is no more\nvenerable character in the Epic than Bhishma, and these rules and laws have\ntherefore been supposed to come from his lips on the solemn occasion of his\ndeath. As a storehouse of Hindu laws and traditions and moral rules these\nepisodes are invaluable; but they form no part of the real Epic, they are not\na portion of the leading story of the Epic, and we pass them by.\n\nBhishma dies and is cremated; but the endless exposition of laws, legends, and\nmoral rules is not yet over. Krishna himself takes up the task in a new Book,\nand, as he has done once before in the _Bhagavat-gita_ , he now once more\nexplains to Arjun in the _Anu-gita_ the great truths about Soul and\nEmancipation, Creation and the Wheel of Life, True Knowledge and Rites and\nPenance. The adventures of the sage Utanka, whom Krishna meets, then take up a\ngood many pages. All this forms no part of the real Epic, and we pass it by.\n\nYudhishthir has in the meantime been crowned king of the Kurus at Hastinapura,\nand a posthumous child of Abhimanyu is named Parikshit, and is destined to\nsucceed to the throne of the Kurus. But Yudhishthir\'s mind is still troubled\nwith the thoughts of the carnage of the war, of which he considers himself\nguilty, and the great saint Vyasa advises the performance of the _aswa medha_\n, or the Sacrifice of the Horse, for the expiation of the sin.\n\nThe Sacrifice of the Horse was an ancient Hindu custom practised by kings\nexercising suzerain powers over surrounding kings. A horse was let free, and\nwas allowed to wander from place to place, accompanied by the king\'s guard. If\nany neighbouring king ventured to detain the animal, it was a signal for war.\nIf no king ventured to restrain the wanderer, it was considered a tacit mark\nof submission to the owner of the animal. And when the horse returned from its\nperegrinations, it was sacrificed with great pomp and splendour at a feast to\nwhich all neighbouring kings were invited.\n\nYudhishthir allowed the sacrificial horse to wander at will, and Arjun\naccompanied it. Wherever the horse was stopped, Arjun fought and conquered,\nand thus proclaimed the supremacy of Yudhishthir over all neighbouring\npotentates. After various wars and adventures in various regions, Arjun at\nlast returned victorious with the steed to Hastinapura, and the sacrifice\ncommenced. The description of the sacrifice is somewhat artificial, and\nconcerns itself with rites and ceremonious details and gifts to Brahmans, and\naltogether bears unmistakable evidence of the interpolating hand of later\npriestly writers. Nevertheless we cannot exclude from this translation of the\nleading incidents of the Epic the last great and crowning act of Yudhishthir,\nnow anointed monarch of Kuru land.\n\nThe portion translated in this Book forms Sections lxxxv. And parts of\nSections lxxxviii. and lxxxix. of Book xiv. of the original text.\n\n## I\n\n## THE GATHERING\n\nVictor of a hundred battles, Arjun bent his homeward way,  \nFollowing still the sacred charger free to wander as it may,\n\nStrolling minstrels to Yudhishthir spake of the returning steed,  \nSpake of Arjun wending homeward with the victor\'s crown of meed,\n\nAnd they sang of Arjun\'s triumph\'s in Gandhara\'s distant vale,  \nOn the banks of Brahmaputra and in Sindhu\'s rocky dale.\n\nTwelfth day came of _Magha\'s_ bright moon and auspicious was the star,  \nNigher came the victor Arjun from his conquests near and far,\n\nGood Yudhishthir called his brothers, faithful twins and Bhima true,  \nSpake to them in gentle accents, and his words were grave and few:\n\n"Bhima! Now returneth Arjun with the steed from many a fray,  \nSo they tell me, noble brother, who have met him on the way,\n\nAnd the time of _aswa-medha_ day by day is drawing nigh,  \nMagha\'s full moon is approaching, and the winter passeth by,\n\nLet the Brahmans versed in Vedas choose the sacrificial site,  \nFor the feast of many nations, for the _aswa-medha_ rite."\n\nBhima heard of Arjun\'s coming,--hero with the curly hair,--  \nAnd to do Yudhishthir\'s mandate did with gladsome heart repair,\n\nBrahmans versed in sacrifices, cunning architects of fame,  \nBuilders of each various altar with the son of Pritha came,\n\nAnd upon a level greensward measured forth the sacred site,  \nLaid it out with halls and pathways for the sacrificial rite.\n\nMansions graced with gem and jewel round the bright arena shone,  \nPalaces of golden lustre glinted in the morning sun,\n\nGilt and blazoned with devices lofty columns stood around,  \nGraceful arches gold-surmounted spanned the consecrated ground,\n\nGay pavilions rose in beauty round the sacrificial site,  \nFor the queens of crowned monarchs wending to the holy rite,\n\nHumbler dwellings rose for Brahmans, priests of learning and of fame,  \nCome to view Yudhishthir\'s _yajna_ and to bless Yudhishthir\'s name.\n\nMessengers with kindly greetings went to monarchs far-renowned,  \nAsked them to Hastina\'s city, to the consecrated ground,\n\nAnd to please the great Yudhishthir came each king and chieftain bold,  \nWith their slaves and dark-eye damsels, arms and horses, gems and gold,\n\nCame and found a royal welcome in pavilions rich and high,  \nAnd the sealike voice of nations smote the echoing vault of sky!\n\nWith his greetings did Yudhishthir, for each chief and king of men,  \nCooling drinks and sumptuous viands, beds of regal pride ordain,\n\nStables filled with corn and barley and with milk and luscious cane  \nGreeted tall and warlike tuskers and the steeds with flowing mane.\n\n_\n\nMunis_ from their hermitages to the sacred _yajna_ came,  \n_Rishis_ from the grove and forest lisping BRAHMA\'S holy name,\n\nFamed _Acharyas_ versed in Vedas to the city held their way,  \n_Brahmacharins_ with grass-girdle, chanting sweet the _saman_ lay,\n\nWelcomed Kuru\'s pious monarch, saint and sage and man of grace,  \nAnd with gentle condescension showed each priest his fitting place.\n\nSkilled mechanics, cunning artists, raised the structures for the rite,  \nAnd with every needful object graced the sacrificial site,\n\nEvery duty thus completed, joyful Yudhishthir\'s mind,  \nAnd he blessed his faithful brothers with an elder\'s blessings kind.\n\n## II\n\n## THE FEASTING\n\nMen in nations are assembled, hymns are sung by saint and sage,  \nAnd in learned disputations keen disputants oft engage,\n\nAnd the concourse of the monarchs view the splendour of the rite,  \nLike the glorious sky of INDRA is the sacrificial site!\n\nBright festoons and flaming streamers are on golden arches hung,  \nGroups of men and gay-dressed women form a bright and joyous throng,\n\nJars of cool and sparkling waters, vessels rich with gold inlaid,  \nCostly cups and golden vases are in order due arrayed.\n\nSacrificial stakes of timber with their golden fastenings graced,  \nConsecrated by the _mantra_ are in sumptuous order placed,\n\nCountless creatures of the wide earth, fishes from the lake and flood.  \nBuffaloes and bulls from pasture, beasts of prey from jungle wood,\n\nBirds and every egg-born creature, insects that from moisture spring,  \nDenizens of cave and mountain for the sacrifice they bring.\n\nNoble chiefs and mighty monarchs gaze in wonder on the site,  \nFilled with every living object, corn and cattle for the rite,\n\nCurd and cake and sweet confection are for feasting Brahmans spread,  \nAnd a hundred thousand people are with sumptuous viands fed!\n\nWith the accents of the rain-cloud drum and trumpet raise their voice,  \nSpeak Yudhishthir\'s noble bounty, bid the sons of men rejoice,\n\nDay by day the holy _yajna_ grows in splendour and in joy,  \nRice in hillocks feeds all comers, maid and matron, man and boy,\n\nLakes of curd and lakes of butter speak Yudhishthir\'s bounteous feast,  \nNations of the Jambu-dwipa share it, greatest and the least!\n\nFor a hundred diverse races from a hundred regions came,  \nAte of good Yudhishthir\'s bounty, sang of good Yudhishthir\'s fame,\n\nAnd a thousand proud attendants, gay with earrings, garland-graced,  \nCarried food unto the feeders and the sweet confections placed,\n\nViands fit for crowned monarchs were unto the Brahmans given,  \nDrinks of rich and cooling fragrance like the nectar-drink of heaven!\n\n## III\n\n## SACRIFICE OF ANIMALS\n\nVictor of a hundred battles, Arjun came with conquering steed,  \nVyasa herald of the Vedas bade the holy rite proceed:\n\n"For the day is come, Yudhishthir, let the sacrifice be done,  \nLet the priests repeat the mantra golden as the morning sun!\n\nThreefold bounteous be thy presents and a threefold merit gain,  \nFor thy wealth of gold is ample, be thy gifts like summer\'s rain,\n\nMay the threefold rich performance purify the darkening stain,  \nBlood of warriors and of kinsmen slaughtered on the gory plain,\n\nMay the _yajna\'s_ pure ablution wash thee of the cruel sin,  \nAnd the meed of sacrificers may the good Yudhishthir win!\n\nVyasa spake; and good Yudhishthir took the _diksha_ of the rite,  \nAnd commenced the _aswa-medha_ gladdening every living wight,\n\nRound the altar\'s holy lustre moved the priests with sacred awe,  \nSwerved not from the rule of duty, failed not in the sacred law.\n\nDone the rite of pure _pravargya_ with the pious hymn and lay,  \nTo the task of _abhishava_ priests and Brahmans led the way,\n\nAnd the holy Soma-drinkers pressed the sacred Soma plant,  \nAnd performed the pure _savana_ with the solemn _saman_ chant.\n\nBounty waits on squalid hunger, gifts dispel the suppliant\'s fear,  \nGold revives the poor and lowly, mercy wipes the mourner\'s tear,\n\nTender care relieves the stricken by the gracious king\'s command,  \nCharity with loving sweetness spreads her smile o\'er all the land!\n\nDay by day the _aswa-medha_ doth with sacred rites proceed,  \nDay by day on royal bounty poor and grateful myriads feed,\n\nAnd adept in six Vedangas, strict in vow and rich in lore,  \nSage preceptors, holy teachers, grew in virtue ever more!\n\nSix good stakes of _vilwa_ timber, six of hard _khadira_ wood,  \nSix of seasoned _sarvavarnin_ , on the place of _yajna_ stood,\n\nTwo were made of _devadaru_ , pine that on Himalay grows,  \nOne was made of wood of _slesha_ , which the sacrificer knows,\n\nOther stakes of golden lustre quaint with curious carving done,  \nDraped in silk and gold-brocaded like the constellations shone!\n\nAnd the consecrated altar built and raised of bricks of gold,  \nShone in splendour like the altar Daksha built in days of old,\n\nEighteen cubits square the structure, four deep layers of brick in height,  \nWith a spacious winged triangle like an eagle in its flight!\n\nBeasts whose flesh is pure and wholesome, dwellers of the lake or sky,  \nPriests assigned each varied offering to each heavenly power on high,\n\nBulls of various breed and colour, steeds of mettle true and tried,  \nOther creatures, full three hundred, to the many stakes were tied.\n\n_\n\nDeva-rishis_ viewed the feasting, sweet _Gandharvas_ woke the song,  \n_Apsaras_ like gleams of sunlight on the greensward tripped along,\n\n_\n\nKinnaras_ and _Kim-purushas_ mingled in the holy rite,  \n_Siddhas_ of austerest penance stood around the sacred site,\n\nVyasa\'s great and gifted pupils who the holy hymns compiled,  \nHelped the royal _aswa-medha_ , on the royal _yajna_ smiled!\n\nFrom the bright ethereal mansions heavenly minstrel Narad came,  \nChitra-sena woke the music, singer of celestial fame,\n\nCheered by more than mortal music priests their holy task begun,  \nAnd Yudhishthir\'s fame and virtue with a brighter lustre shone!\n\n## VI\n\n## SACRIFICE OF THE HORSE\n\nBirds and beasts were immolated for the sacrificial food,  \nThen before the sacred charger priests in rank and order stood,\n\nAnd by rules of Veda guided slew the horse of noble breed,  \nPlaced Draupadi, _Queen of yajna_ , by the slain and lifeless steed,\n\nHymns and gifts and deep devotion sanctified the noble Queen,  \nWoman\'s true and stainless virtue, woman\'s worth and wisdom keen!\n\nPriests adept in sacred duty cooked the steed with pious rite,  \nAnd the steam of welcome fragrance sanctified the sacred site,\n\nGood Yudhishthir and his brothers, by the rules by _rishis_ spoke,  \nPiously inhaled the fragrance and the sin-destroying smoke!\n\nSevered limbs and sacred fragments of the courser duly dressed,  \nPriests upon the blazing altar as a pious offering placed,\n\nVyasa herald of the Vedas raised his voice in holy song,  \nBlessed Hastina\'s righteous monarch and the many-nationed throng!\n\n## V\n\n## GIFTS\n\nUnto Brahmans gave Yudhishthir countless _nishkas_ of bright gold,  \nUnto sage and saintly Vyasa all his realm and wealth untold,\n\nBut the bard and ancient _rishi_ who the holy Vedas spake,  \nRendered back the monarch\'s present, earthly gift he might not take!\n\n"Thine is Kuru\'s ancient empire, rule the nations of the earth,  \nGods have destined thee as monarch from the moment of thy birth,\n\nGold and wealth and costly present let the priests and Brahmans hoard,  \nBe it thine to rule thy subjects as their father and their lord!\n\nKrishna too in gentle accents to the doubting monarch said:  \n"Vyasa. speaketh word of wisdom and his mandate be obeyed!"\n\nFrom the _rishi_ good Yudhishthir then received the Kuru-land,  \nWith a threefold gift of riches gladdened all the priestly band,\n\nPious priests and grateful nations to their distant regions went,  \nAnd his share of presents Vyasa to the ancient Pritha sent.\n\nFame and virtue Kuru\'s monarch by the _aswa-medha_ wins,  \nAnd the rite of pure ablution cleanses all Yudhishthir\'s sins,\n\nAnd be stands amid his brothers, brightly beaming, pure and high,  \nEven as INDRA stands encircled by the dwellers of the sky,\n\nAnd the concourse of the monarchs grace Yudhishthir\'s regal might,  \nAs the stars and radiant planets grace the stillness of the night!\n\nGems and jewels in his bounty, gold and garments rich and rare,  \nGave Yudhishthir to each monarch, slaves and damsels passing fair,\n\nLoving gifts to dear relations gave the king of righteous fame,  \nAnd the grateful parting monarchs blessed Yudhishthir\'s hallowed name.\n\nLast of all with many tear-drops Krishna mounts his lofty car,  \nFaithful still in joy or sorrow, faithful still in peace or war,\n\nArjun\'s comrade. Bhima\'s helper, good Yudhishthir\'s friend of yore,  \nKrishna leaves Hastina\'s mansions for the sea-girt Dwarka\'s shore!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Conclusion](mahaconc.htm)\n\n'
