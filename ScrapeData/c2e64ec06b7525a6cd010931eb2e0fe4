Know! I am that womb:  \nI make and I unmake this Universe:  \nThan me there is no other Master, Prince!  \nNo other Maker! All these hang on me  \nAs hangs a row of pearls upon its string.  \nI am the fresh taste of the water; I  \nThe silver of the moon, the gold o\' the sun,  \nThe word of worship in the Veds, the thrill  \nThat passeth in the ether, and the strength  \nOf man\'s shed seed. I am the good sweet smell  \nOf the moistened earth, I am the fire\'s red light,  \nThe vital air moving in all which moves,  \nThe holiness of hallowed souls, the root  \nUndying, whence hath sprung whatever is;  \nThe wisdom of the wise, the intellect  \nOf the informed, the greatness of the great.  \nThe splendour of the splendid. Kunti\'s Son!  \nThese am I, free from passion and desire;  \nYet am I right desire in all who yearn,  \nChief of the Bharatas! for all those moods,  \nSoothfast, or passionate, or ignorant,  \nWhich Nature frames, deduce from me; but all  \nAre merged in me- not I in them! The world-  \nDeceived by those three qualities of being-  \nWotteth not Me Who am outside them all,  \nAbove them all, Eternal! Hard it is  \nTo pierce that veil divine of various shows  \nWhich hideth Me; yet they who worship Me  \nPierce it and pass beyond.\n\nI am not known  \nTo evil-doers, nor to foolish ones,  \nNor to the base and churlish; nor to those  \nWhose mind is cheated by the show of things,  \nNor those that take the way of Asuras.\n\nFour sorts of mortals know me: he who weeps,  \nArjuna! and the man who yearns to know;  \nAnd he who toils to help; and he who sits  \nCertain of me, enlightened.\n\nOf these four,  \nO Prince of India! highest, nearest, best  \nThat last is, the devout soul, wise, intent  \nUpon "The One." Dear, above all, am I  \nTo him; and he is dearest unto me!  \nAll four are good, and seek me; but mine own,  \nThe true of heart, the faithful- stayed on me,  \nTaking me as their utmost, blessedness,  \nThey are not "mine," but I- even I myself!  \nAt end of many births to Me they come!  \nYet hard the wise Mahatma is to find,  \nThat man who sayeth, "All is Vasudev!"\n\nThere be those, too, whose knowledge, turned aside  \nBy this desire or that, gives them to serve  \nSome lower gods, with various rites, constrained  \nBy that which mouldeth them. Unto all such-  \nWorship what shrine they will, what shapes, in faith-  \n\'Tis I who give them faith! I am content!  \nThe heart thus asking favour from its God,  \nDarkened but ardent, hath the end it craves,  \nThe lesser blessing- but \'tis I who give!  \nYet soon is withered what small fruit they reap:  \nThose men of little minds, who worship so,  \nGo where they worship, passing with their gods.  \nBut Mine come unto me! Blind are the eyes  \nWhich deem th\' Unmanifested manifest,  \nNot comprehending Me in my true Self!  \nImperishable, viewless, undeclared,  \nHidden behind my magic veil of shows,  \nI am not seen by all; I am not known-  \nUnborn and changeless- to the idle world.  \nBut I, Arjuna! know all things which were,  \nAnd all which are, and all which are to be,  \nAlbeit not one among them knoweth Me!\n\nBy passion for the "pairs of opposites,"  \nBy those twain snares of Like and Dislike, Prince!  \nAll creatures live bewildered, save some few  \nWho, quit of sins, holy in act, informed,  \nFreed from the "opposites," and fixed in faith,  \nCleave unto Me.\n\nWho cleave, who seek in Me  \nRefuge from birth and death, those have the Truth!  \nThose know Me BRAHMA: know Me Soul of Souls,  \nThe ADHYATMAN: know KARMA, my work;  \nKnow I am ADHIBHUTA, Lord of Life,  \nAnd ADHIDAIVA, Lord of all the Gods,  \nAnd ADHIYAJNA, Lord of Sacrifice;  \nWorship Me well, with hearts of love and faith,  \nAnd find and hold me in the hour of death.\n\nHERE ENDETH CHAPTER VII OF THE  \nBHAGAVAD-GITA,  \nEntitled "Vijnanayog,"  \nOr "The Book of Religion by Discernment."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 8: Of Religion by Devotion to the One Supreme God](bg08.htm)\n\n'
