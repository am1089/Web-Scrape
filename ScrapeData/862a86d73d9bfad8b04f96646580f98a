Now it was by means of the Vai _s_ vadeva that Pra _g_ apati\nproduced living beings. The beings produced by him ate (ghas) Varu _n_ a\'s\nbarley corn; for originally the barley belonged to Varu _n_ a. And from their\neating Varu _n_ a\'s barley corn the name Varu _n_ apraghasa _h_ (is derived).\n\n2:5:2:22\\. Varu _n_ a seized them; and on being seized by Varu _n_ a, they\nbecame rent all over 1; and they lay and sat them down breathing in and\nbreathing out. The out-breathing and in-breathing forsook them not, but all\nthe other deities 2 forsook them; and owing to these two, the creatures did\nnot perish.\n\n2:5:2:33\\. Pra _g_ apati healed them by means of that oblation: both the\ncreatures that were born and those that were unborn he delivered from Varu _n_\na\'s noose; and his creatures were born without disease and blemish.\n\n2:5:2:44\\. Now when this (sacrificer) performs these offerings in the fourth\nmonth (after the Vai _s_ vadeva), he does so either because thus Varu _n_ a\ndoes not seize his offspring, or because the gods performed (the same\noffering); and both the children that have been born to him and those that are\nyet unborn he thereby delivers from Varu _n_ a\'s noose, and his children are\nborn without disease and blemish. This is why he performs these offerings in\nthe fourth month.\n\np. 392\n\n2:5:2:55\\. At this (sacrifice) there are two altars and two fires 1. The\nreason why there are two altars and two\n\np. 393\n\nfires, is that thereby one frees the creatures from Varu _n_ a\'s noose both\nways,--on the one side (he frees) the upright, and on the other those looking\nto the ground: this is why there are two altars and two fires.\n\n2:5:2:66\\. On the northern (uttara) altar he raises the uttara-vedi (upper or\nnorth altar), not on the southern one. Varu _n_ a, doubtless, is the nobility,\nand the Maruts are the people: he thus makes the nobility superior (uttara) to\nthe people; and hence people here serve the Kshatriya, placed above them. This\nis why he raises the uttara-vedi on the northern, not on the southern altar.\n\n2:5:2:77\\. In the first place there are those five oblations 1. For by means\nof those five oblations Pra _g_ apati produced the creatures, with them he\nfreed the creatures both ways from Varu _n_ a\'s noose,--on the one side (he\nfreed) the upright, and on the other those that tend to the ground: this is\nwhy there are those five oblations.\n\n2:5:2:88\\. Then follows a cake on twelve potsherds for Indra and Agni. Indra\nand Agni indeed are the out-breathing and in-breathing: thus this is like\n\np. 394\n\ndoing a good turn to one who has done him a good turn; for it is owing to\nthese two that his creatures 1 did not perish. Hence he now restores his\ncreatures by means of the out-breathing and in-breathing, bestows out-\nbreathing and in-breathing on them: this is why there is a cake on twelve\npotsherds for Indra and Agni.\n\n2:5:2:99\\. On both (fires) there is an oblation of curds. It is on milk that\nthe creatures subsist and by means of milk that they were preserved: hence it\nis with that by which they were preserved and whereon they subsist, that he\ndelivers them both ways from Varu _n_ a\'s noose,--on the one side (he\ndelivers) the upright and on the other those looking to the ground. This is\nwhy there is an oblation of curds on both (fires).\n\n2:5:2:1010\\. The northern one is offered to Varu _n_ a, since it was Varu _n_\na who seized his (Pra _g_ apati\'s) creatures: hence he thereby directly\ndelivers them from Varu _n_ a\'s noose. The southern one is offered to the\nMaruts. It is for the sake of diversity that it is offered to the Maruts; for\na repetition he would undoubtedly commit, were he to offer both to Varu _n_ a.\nMoreover, it was from the south that the Maruts intended to slay his (Pra _g_\napati\'s) creatures, and with that share he propitiated them: for this reason\nthe southern (oblation of curds) belongs to the Maruts.\n\n2:5:2:1111\\. Upon both (dishes of curds) he scatters karira-fruits 2; for with\nkarira-fruits Pra _g_ apati\n\np. 395\n\nbestowed happiness (ka) on the creatures, and so does he (the sacrificer)\nthereby bestow happiness on the creatures.\n\n2:5:2:1212\\. Upon both of them he also scatters _s_ ami-leaves; for with _s_\nami-leaves Pra _g_ apati bestowed bliss ( _s_ am) on the creatures, and so\ndoes he now thereby bestow bliss on the creatures.\n\n2:5:2:1313\\. Then follows a cake on one potsherd for Ka (Pra _g_ apati); for\nby that cake on one potsherd to Ka Pra _g_ apati indeed bestowed happiness\n(ka) on the creatures, and so does he (the sacrificer) now bestow happiness on\nthe creatures by that one-cup cake: this is why there is a cake on one\npotsherd for Ka.\n\n2:5:2:1414\\. And on the first day, after husking and slightly roasting barley\non the Dakshi _n_ agni, they prepare therewith as many dishes of karambha 1 as\nthere are members of the (sacrificer\'s) family, exceeded by one.\n\n2:5:2:1515\\. At the same time they also prepare a ram and a ewe; and if he be\nable to procure wool other than from e _d_ aka sheep, let him wash it and\nstick it on both the ram and the ewe; but should he not be able to procure\nwool other than from e _d_ aka sheep, tufts of ku _s_ a grass may also be\n(used).\n\n2:5:2:1616\\. The reason why there are a ram and a ewe is chat the ram\nmanifestly is Varu _n_ a\'s victim, so that he thereby manifestly delivers the\ncreatures from Varu _n_ a\'s noose. They are made of barley, because it was\nwhen they (the creatures) had eaten barley that Varu _n_ a seized them. A pair\nthey form, so that he\n\np. 396\n\ndelivers the creatures from Varu _n_ a\'s noose through conjugal union.\n\n2:5:2:1717\\. The ewe he places on the southern, and the ram on the northern\ndish of curds; for in this way alone a proper union is effected, since the\nwoman lies on the left (or north) side of the man.\n\n2:5:2:1818\\. The Adhvaryu places all the (other) sacrificial dishes upon the\nnorthern altar; and the Pratiprasthat _ri_ places on the southern altar that\ndish of curds (belonging to the Maruts).\n\n2:5:2:1919\\. Having thus placed the sacrificial dishes, he churns the fire;\nand having churned it and placed it on (the hearth) 1, he offers thereon, The\nAdhvaryu in the first place says (to the Hot _ri_ ) 2, \'Recite to the fire\nthat is being kindled!\' Both (the Adhvaryu and the Pratiprasthat _ri_ ) then\nput firewood on (the fire) and both reserve one kindling-stick each; and they\nboth pour out the first libation (aghara). Thereupon the Adhvaryu says,\n\'Agnidh, trim the fire!\' Although the summons is given, the trimming does not\ntake place (immediately) 3\n\n2:5:2:2020\\. Thereupon the Pratiprasthat _ri_ returns (to where the\nsacrificer\'s wife is seated). When he is about to lead the wife away, he asks\nher, \'With\n\np. 397\n\nwhom holdest thou intercourse?\' Now when a woman who belongs to one (man)\ncarries on intercourse with another, she undoubtedly commits (a sin) against\nVaru _n_ a. He therefore thus asks her, lest she should sacrifice with a\nsecret pang in her mind; for when confessed the sin becomes less, since it\nbecomes truth; this is why he thus asks her. And whatever (connection) she\nconfesses 1 not, that indeed will turn out injurious to her relatives.\n\n2:5:2:2121\\. He then makes her say the text (III, 44), \'We invoke the Maruts,\nthe voracious consumers of enemies, delighting in their porridge.\' This\n(verse) is (of like import) as the invitatory prayer she therewith invites\nthem to these dishes 2.\n\n2:5:2:2222\\. Of these (dishes) there is one for each descendant; as many\n(children) as there are in the (sacrificer\'s) family, so many (dishes) there\nare, exceeded by one. There being one for each descendant, he thereby delivers\nfrom Varu _n_ a\'s noose one by one the children born to him; and there being\nan additional one, he thereby delivers from Varu _n_ a\'s\n\np. 398\n\nnoose those children of his that are as yet unborn: this is why there are (the\nsame number of dishes) exceeded by one.\n\n2:5:2:2323\\. (In the form of) dishes they are, because it is from dishes that\nfood is eaten; and of barley they are prepared, because it was when they (the\ncreatures) had eaten the barley corn that Varu _n_ a seized them. From the\nwinnowing basket she offers, because food is prepared by means of the\nwinnowing basket. The wife offers (together with her husband): thus he\ndelivers his offspring from Varu _n_ a\'s noose through conjugal union.\n\n2:5:2:2424\\. She offers previously to the sacrifice, previously to the\noblations, since the people do not eat offerings, and the Maruts are the\npeople. Now when Pra _g_ apati\'s creatures, being seized by Varu _n_ a, became\nrent all over, and sat and lay them down, breathing in and breathing out, then\nthe Maruts destroyed their sin; and so do the Maruts now destroy the sin of\nhis (the sacrificer\'s) offspring. This is why she offers previously to the\nsacrifice, previously to the oblations.\n\n2:5:2:2525\\. He 1 offers in the southern fire, with the text (III, 45),\n\'Whatever (sin we have committed) in the village and forest,\'--for both in the\nvillage and in the forest sin is committed;--\'whatever in society and in our\nown self,\'--by \'whatever (we have committed) in society,\' he means to say\n\'against man;\' and by \'whatever in our own self\' (indriya), he means to say\n\'against the gods;\'--\'whatever sin\n\np. 399\n\nwe have here committed, that we expiate by offering, Svaha!\'--whereby he says\n\'whatsoever sin we have committed, from all that we rid ourselves.\'\n\n2:5:2:2626\\. Thereupon he mutters the (verse) addressed to Indra and referring\nto the Maruts.--Now when the Maruts destroyed the sin of Pra _g_ apati\'s\ncreatures, he thought within himself, \'I hope they will not destroy my\ncreatures.\'\n\n2:5:2:2727\\. He muttered that (verse) addressed to Indra and referring to the\nMaruts. Indra indeed is the nobility, and the Maruts are the people; and the\nnobility are the controllers of the people: \'They shall be controlled,\' he\nthought; and therefore (that verse, Va _g_. S. III, 46) is addressed to Indra.\n\n2:5:2:2828\\. \'Let there not, O Indra, be (fight) for us here in battles with\nthe gods, since there is a share for thee in the sacrifice, O fiery one!--for\nthee, the mighty showerer of gifts, whose Maruts the song of the offerer\nstream-like celebrates.\'\n\n2:5:2:2929\\. He then makes her say the text (Va _g_. S. III, 47), \'The men\nskilled in the work have done the work,\'--those skilled in the work have\nindeed done the work;--\'with pleasing song;\'--for with song they have done it.\n\'Having done the work for the gods;\'--for the gods indeed they have done the\nwork; \'go home, ye companions!\'--they are now together with her while she is\nled thither from an other place: hence she says, \'ye companions\' (sa _k_ abhu,\n\'being together\'). \'Go home,\' she says, because that wife doubtless is the\nhind part of the sacrifice, and he has just now made her take her seat to the\neast of the sacrifice. \'Home\' doubtless means the house, and the house is a\nresting-place: hence he thereby makes her rest in that resting-place, the\nhouse.\n\np. 400\n\n2:5:2:3030\\. Having led her back (to her seat) the Pratiprasthat _ri_ returns\n(to his place by the side of the southern altar). They now trim the fire 1.\nWhen the fire has been trimmed, both (the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasthat _ri_ )\nmake the second libation (of butter). Thereupon the Adhvaryu, having called\n(on the \xc3\x82gnidhra) for the \' _S_ rausha _t_ ,\' chooses the Hot _ri_. The chosen\nHot _ri_ then seats himself on the Hot _ri_ \'s seat beside the northern altar;\nand having seated himself, he urges (the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasthat _ri_ ) to\nproceed. Being thus urged to proceed, they both take up the spoons and step\nacross (to the south side of the fires). After stepping across and calling for\nthe \' _S_ rausha _t_ ,\' the Adhvaryu says (to the Hot _ri_ ), \'Pronounce the\noffering-prayer on the kindling-sticks!\' and \'Pronounce the offering-prayer!\'\nat each (subsequent fore-offering). Pouring (the butter in the spoons)\ntogether (into the _g_ uhu) at the fourth 2, they both proceed with the nine\nfore-offerings 3.\n\n2:5:2:3131\\. Thereupon the Adhvaryu says (to the Hot _ri_ ),\n\np. 401\n\n[paragraph continues] \'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni!\' referring to\nAgni\'s butter-portion 1. Both (the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasthat _ri_ ) having\ntaken four \'cuttings\' of butter, they step across (to the north side of their\nrespective fires). Having stepped across and called for the \' _S_ rausha _t_\n,\' the Adhvaryu says (to the Hot _ri_ ), \'Pronounce the offering-formula to\nAgni!\' After the \'Vasha _t_ \' has been uttered, they both pour out the\noblation.\n\n2:5:2:3232\\. The Adhvaryu then says, \'Pronounce (the invitatory prayer) to\nSoma!\' referring to Soma\'s butter-portion. Both having taken four cuttings of\nbutter, they step across. Having stepped across and called for the \' _S_\nrausha _t_ ,\' the Adhvaryu says (to the Hot _ri_ ), \'Pronounce the offering-\nprayer to Soma!\' After the \'Vasha _t_ \' has been uttered, they both pour out\nthe oblation.\n\n2:5:2:3333\\. Thus whatever has to be done by speech, that the Adhvaryu does,\nand not the Pratiprasthat _ri_. Now as to why the Adhvaryu alone calls for the\n\' _S_ rausha _t_.\' Here indeed when the \'Vasha _t_ \' is pronounced,\n\n2:5:2:3434\\. The Pratiprasthat _ri_ is merely the imitator of what is done (by\nthe Adhvaryu). For Varu _n_ a is the nobility, and the Maruts are the people:\nhence he thereby makes the people the imitators, the followers of the\nnobility. But were the Pratiprasthat _ri_ also to call for the \' _S_ rausha\n_t_ ,\' he would doubtless make the people equal in power to the nobility: for\nthis reason the Pratiprasthat _ri_ does not call for the \' _S_ rausha _t_.\'\n\n2:5:2:3535\\. The Pratiprasthat _ri_ sits down, after taking the two offering-\nspoons in his hand. The Adhvaryu then\n\np. 402\n\nproceeds with those oblations,--viz. Agni\'s cake on eight potsherds, Soma\'s\npap, Savit _ri_ \'s cake on twelve or eight potsherds, Sarasvati\'s pap,\nPushan\'s pap, and Indra and Agni\'s cake on twelve potsherds.\n\n2:5:2:3636\\. Thereupon, being about to proceed with those two oblations of\ncurds, (the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasthat _ri_ ) exchange (the ram and ewe): the\nram which was on the Maruts\' (dish of curds) he (the Adhvaryu) places on that\nof Varu _n_ a; and the ewe which was on Varu _n_ a\'s (dish of curds) he (the\nPratiprasthat _ri_ ) places on that of the Maruts. Now the reason why they\nmake this exchange, is this,--Varu _n_ a is the nobility, and the male\nrepresents energy: hence they thereby bestow energy on the nobility. The\nfemale, on the other hand, is without energy; and the Maruts are the people:\nhence they thereby cause the people to be without energy. This is why they\nmake this exchange.\n\n2:5:2:3737\\. The Adhvaryu now says (to the Hot _ri_ ), \'Pronounce the\ninvitatory prayer to Varu _n_ a!\' He then pours an \'under-layer\' of butter\n(into the _g_ uhu), takes two cuttings from Varu _n_ a\'s curds, and with\neither of the two cuttings puts the rant (in the spoon). He then pours butter\nthereon, replenishes (the place whence) the two cuttings (have been made), and\nsteps across (to the south side of the fire). After stepping across and\ncalling for the \' _S_ rausha _t_ ,\' he says (to the Hot _ri_ ), \'Pronounce the\noffering-prayer to Varu _n_ a!\' and, on the \'Vashat\' being uttered, he pours\nout the oblation.\n\n2:5:2:3838\\. Thereupon the Adhvaryu takes both spoons in his left hand; and\ntaking hold of the Pratiprasthat _ri_ \'s garment, says (to the Hot _ri_ ),\n\'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to the Maruts!\' The\n\np. 403\n\n[paragraph continues] Pratiprasthat _ri_ then makes an \'under-layer\' of butter\n(in his _g_ uhu and two cuttings from the curds of the Maruts, and with either\nof the two cuttings puts the ewe (in the spoon). He then pours butter thereon,\nreplenishes (the place of) the two cuttings, and steps across (to the south of\nthe fire). The Adhvaryu, having called for the \' _S_ rausha _t_ ,\' says (to\nthe Hot _ri_ ), \'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the Maruts!\' and on the\n\'Vasha _t_ \' being uttered, (the Pratiprasthat _ri_ ) he pours out the\noblation.\n\n2:5:2:3939\\. The Adhvaryu then proceeds with the cake on eleven potsherds for\nKa; and having made that offering, he says, \'Pronounce the invitatory prayer\nto Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t (" the maker of good offering")!\' The Adhvaryu\nthen takes cuttings from all (his) oblations, one from each; and the\nPratiprasthat _ri_ also takes one cutting from that oblation of curds (to the\nMaruts). They then pour twice butter upon (the portions), and step across (to\nthe south side of the fires). On stepping across and calling for the \' _S_\nrausha _t_ ,\' the Adhvaryu says, \'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Agni Svish\n_t_ ak _ri_ t;\' and after the (concluding) \'Vasha _t_ ,\' they both pour out\nthe oblation.\n\n2:5:2:4040\\. The Adhvaryu now cuts off the fore-portion. Having then cut off\nthe I _d_ a piece by piece, he hands it to the Pratiprasthat _ri_ ; and the\nPratiprasthat _ri_ puts thereon two cuttings from the Maruts\' curds. He (the\nAdhvaryu) then pours twice butter thereon. After invoking (the I _d_ a), they\ncleanse themselves 1.\n\n2:5:2:4141\\. Thereupon the Adhvaryu says, \'O Brahman, shall I step forward?\'\nHaving put on the (remaining) kindling-stick 2 he says, Agnidh, trim the fire!\n\np. 404\n\n[paragraph continues] He, the Adhvaryu, then pours the clotted butter 1 (in\nthe p _ri_ shada _g_ ya-upabh _ri_ t) into the two spoons (the _g_ uhu and\nupabh _ri_ t); and the Pratiprasthat _ri_ also, if he have any clotted butter,\ndivides it into two parts and pours it (into the two spoons); but if there is\nno clotted butter, he divides the butter in the upabh _ri_ t in two parts and\npours them out separately. Then both step across (to the south side of the\nfires). The Adhvaryu, having stepped across and called for the \' _S_ rausha\n_t_ ,\' says (to the Hot _ri_ ), \'Pronounce the offering-formula to the gods!\'\nand, \'Pronounce the offering-formula!\' at each (subsequent after-offering).\nThus they both perform the nine after-offerings 2, pouring together (the\nbutter from the spoons) at the (or at every) fourth after-offering. The reason\nwhy there are nine fore-offerings and nine after-offerings, is that he thereby\ndelivers the creatures both times from Varu _n_ a\'s noose,--by the former (he\ndelivers) the upright and by the latter those looking to the ground: for this\nreason there are nine fore-offerings and nine after-offerings.\n\n2:5:2:4242\\. They both then separate the spoons 3, after laying them (on the\naltars). Having separated the spoons, and anointed the enclosing-sticks; and\nhaving thereupon taken hold of the (middle) enclosing-stick,\n\np. 405\n\nand called for the (\xc3\x82gnidhra\'s) \' _S_ rausha _t_ ,\' the Adhvaryu thus\naddresses (the Hot _ri_ ) 1, \'The divine Hot _ri_ s are summoned for the\nproclamation of success; the human is called upon for the song of praise!\' The\nHot _ri_ then intones the song of praise (suktavaka). Thereupon both seize\ntheir prastara-bunches and throw them (into the fires); both take a single\nstraw each therefrom and remain sitting by (the fires); when the Hot _ri_\nrecites the song of praise,--\n\n2:5:2:4343\\. The \xc3\x82gnidhra says, \'Throw after!\' Both (the Adhvaryu and\nPratiprasthat _ri_ ) throw (the stalk) after (the prastara); and both touch\nthemselves.\n\n2:5:2:4444\\. He (the \xc3\x82gnidhra) then says 2, \'Discourse (with me)!\' [The\nAdhvaryu asks,] \'Has he gone (to the gods), Agnidh? He has gone!\'--\'Bid (the\ngods) hear!\'--\'Yea, may (one) hear!\'--\'Goodspeed to the divine Hot _ri_ s!\nSuccess to the human!\'---The Adhvaryu also (afterwards) 3 says (to the Hot\n_ri_ ), \'Pronounce the "All-hail and blessing!"\' They both throw the\nenclosing-sticks (into the fire); and after taking up the spoons together,\nthey both place them on the wooden sword 4.\n\n2:5:2:4545\\. Thereupon the Adhvaryu returns (to the Garhapatya fire) and\nperforms the Patnisa _m_ ya _g_ as 5. The Pratiprasthat _ri_ , in the\nmeantime,\n\np. 406\n\nremains waiting. After performing the Patnisa _m_ ya _g_ as, the Adhvaryu\nsteps up (to the northern fire).\n\n2:5:2:4646\\. He (the Adhvaryu) performs the three Samish _t_ aya _g_ us (with\nthe respective texts) 1; the Pratiprasthat _ri_ takes up his spoon (and\nperforms those oblations) silently.--The same garments, worn by the sacrificer\nand his wife at the Vai _s_ vadeva, should be put on also on this occasion.\nThey now take (the havis) mixed with the burnt scrapings of the Varu _n_ a\ncurds, and betake themselves to (the place of) the expiatory bath (avabh _ri_\ntha). This (ablution) stands in relation to Varu _n_ a, (being performed) with\na view to deliverance from Varu _n_ a\'s power. No Saman-hymn is sung on this\noccasion, for at this (sacrifice) nothing whatever is performed with a Saman-\nhymn. Having silently walked thither and entered (the water), he (the\nAdhvaryu) immerses (the vessel containing the scrapings).\n\n2:5:2:4747\\. With the text (Va _g_. S. III, 48), \'O laving bath, laving thou\nglidest along: with the help of the gods may I wipe out the sin committed\nagainst the gods, and with the help of mortals the sin committed against\nmortals! Preserve me, O God, from injury from the fiercely-howling (demon)!\'\nThose (garments worn while bathing) 2 he may give\n\np. 407\n\nto whichever (priest) he chooses, since they are not the garments of an\ninitiated person. Even as a snake casts its skin, so does he cast away all his\nsin.\n\n2:5:2:4848\\. Thereupon they shave (the sacrificer\'s) hair and beard; and take\nup the two fires 1,--for only after changing his place (to the ordinary\nsacrificial ground) he performs that (other) sacrifice 2, since it is not\nproper that he should perform the Agnihotra on the uttaravedi: for this reason\nhe changes his place. Having gone to the house 3 and \'churned out\' the fires,\nhe performs the full-moon offering. These seasonal offerings doubtless are\ndetached sacrifices; whereas the full-moon offering is a regular, established\nsacrifice: hence he finally establishes himself by means of that regular\nsacrifice; and therefore he changes his place (to the ordinary sacrificial\nground).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[391:1](sbe1257.htm#fr_881) Paridir _n_ a, i.e. swollen, dropsical.\n\n[391:2](sbe1257.htm#fr_882) In the St. Petersb. Dict. devata is here taken as\n\'organ of sense.\'\n\n[392:1](sbe1257.htm#fr_883) For the performance of the Varu _n_ apraghasa _h_\nthe Adhvaryu and his assistant, the Pratiprasthat _ri_ , have to prepare,--to\nthe east of the \xc3\x82havaniya, and at the distance of at least three steps\n(prakrama) from it,--two altars, separate from each other by about a span (of\nthumb and fore-finger), one south of the other. The northern one, belonging to\nthe Adhvaryu, is to measure between four and five cubits along the west side,\nand between three and four cubits along the east side; the two sides being\nbetween six and eight cubits distant from each other. The southern altar,\nreserved for the Pratiprasthat _ri_ ; is to be of the usual size of the altar\nat the havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a. The ceremonies, detailed in I, 2, Brahma _n_ as 4\nand 5, have to be performed also on the present occasion. In the middle of the\neast side of the northern altar a stake is fixed in the ground. On the north\nside of the northern altar, and contiguous with it, a pit ( _k_ atvala), 1\xe2\x85\x93\ncubits (the length of the wedge) square, is dug, so as to be separated on the\nwest from the utkara (heap of rubbish) by a narrow passage. With the mould dug\nup from the pit, the so-called uttara-vedi (upper or north altar) is raised on\nthe northern altar, either of the same dimensions as the pit (1\xe2\x85\x93 cubits\nsquare) or one third of the area of the northern altar, and so that the stake\nmarks the middle of its east side. In the centre of this mound he makes a\nhollow (or \'navel\'), a span square; and the whole mound is then bestrewed with\nfine gravel. The texts used while tracing the sides of the pit, thrice\nthrowing the wooden sword within the marked-off space, and raising the uttara-\nvedi, are given Va _g_. S. V, 9-10. During the night the uttara-vedi remains\ncovered with udumbara or plaksha branches or with sacrificial grass. Next\nmorning the two fires for the newly-constructed fireplaces are taken from the\n\xc3\x82havaniya, either by dividing the latter into two equal parts, or by means of\ntwo bundles of firewood (threefold bound, see [p. 389](sbe1256.htm#page_389),\nnote [1](sbe1256.htm#fn_870)), lighted at it, and carried eastwards in a pan\ncovered with sand or mould. While the fires, together with the lustral water\nand a spoonful of ghee, taken from the pot by five ladlings with the sruva,\nare taken eastward, the Hot _ri_ thrice recites the verse \'Pra devyam deva,\'\n&c.; and the Pratiprasthat _ri_ draws, with the wooden sword, a line from the\n\xc3\x82havaniya to the south-west corner (or \'right hip\') of the northern altar, or\nto the uttara-vedi. The Adhvaryu, standing between the two altars, then\nbesprinkles the uttara-vedi with water, while muttering the p. 393 texts Va\n_g_. S. V, II; whereupon he pours out on it crosswise the spoonful of\nclarified butter, with the texts V, 12; and lays, with the mantras V, 13,\nthree enclosing-sticks (paridhi) of pitadaru wood round the \'navel\' (see I, 3,\n4, 2 seq.), and puts bdellium, fragrant reed-grass, and the front-hair of a\nram on the \'navel\' as a foundation (sambhara, see II, 1, 1, 1 seq.) for the\nfire, which is then laid down thereon. On a hearth-mound (khara), a cubit\nsquare, formed on the southern altar, the Pratiprasthat _ri_ also lays down\nhis fire, after performing the usual fivefold lustration (see [p.\n2](sbe1203.htm#page_2)). Thereupon the pra _n_ ita-water is brought forward in\nthe way set forth at I, 1, 1, 12 seq. Katy. V, 3, 9-4, 21. For a different\nmode of transferring the fire to the special fire-places, see p. 396, note 1.\n\n[393:1](sbe1257.htm#fr_884) See II. 5, 1, 11, with note.\n\n[394:1](sbe1257.htm#fr_885) That is, his offspring and cattle.\n\n[394:2](sbe1257.htm#fr_886) The fruit of Capparis Aphylla. According to Saya\n_n_ a, on Taitt. I, 8, 3, it is karira-shoots--which he says resemble the\nSoma-creeper (somavalli)--that are so used; but he also mentions that some\nauthorities take karira to mean the fruit. According to a sutra he p. 395\nquotes, above a hundred _s_ ami-leaves and above a thousand kariras should be\nstrewn over the two dishes of curds. Cf. Taitt. Br. I, 6, 5, 5.\n\n[395:1](sbe1257.htm#fr_887) A kind of porridge prepared with roasted barley,\ncoarsely ground, and sour curds.\n\n[396:1](sbe1257.htm#fr_888) The author here apparently alludes to a different\nway of transferring the fire to the new fire-places from that detailed by\nKatyayana (see p. 392, note 1). The same mode seems to be referred to by the\nPaddhati on Katy. V, 4 (p. 467). According to this mode (called sarnaropa _n_\na, or mounting of the fire), the old fires are \'taken up\' by means of the two\nara _n_ is being lighted, or rather heated, at them, and then \'churned out\'\nand placed on the newly-prepared hearth-mounds.\n\n[396:2](sbe1257.htm#fr_889) For the detailed course of procedure, see I, 3, 5,\nI seq.\n\n[396:3](sbe1257.htm#fr_890) Asa _m_ s _ri_ sh _t_ am eva bhavati sampreshitam.\nThe Ka _n_ va recension reads, asa _m_ s _ri_ sh _t_ a evagnir bhavati\nsampreshita _h_. Cf. par. 30.\n\n[397:1](sbe1257.htm#fr_891) According to Katy. V, 5, 7-9, she is either to\ngive the total number or the names of her lovers, or to hold up as many stalks\nof grass. [If she have none, she is to reply, \'with no one else.\' Comm.]--\'He\nmakes the wife speak (confess): (thereby) he renders her pure, and then he\nleads her to penance. Were she not to reveal (the name of) a paramour she has,\nshe would harm a dear relative. Let her declare "N.N. is my paramour," by thus\ndeclaring (any one) she causes him to be seized by Varu _n_ a.\' Taitt. Br. I,\n6, 5, 2.\n\n[397:2](sbe1257.htm#fr_892) According to the Black Ya _g_ us, the\nPratiprasthat _ri_ mutters this formula, while leading the mistress to the\nplace of offering. The sacrificer then recites as the invitatory prayer the\nverse given in par. 28 (Va _g_. S. III, 46); while the offering-prayer (Va\n_g_. S. III, 45) and the text III, 47 (par. 29) are muttered by both the\nhusband and wife. Taitt. I, 6, 5, 3 argues against the practice of the wife\nbeing made to pronounce the anuvakya.\n\n[398:1](sbe1257.htm#fr_893) According to Katy. V, 5, 11, either the mistress\nalone offers, or she together with her husband. In the latter case, the\noffering-formula (as well as the dedicatory formula, \'This to the Maruts\') is\npronounced by both.\n\n[400:1](sbe1257.htm#fr_894) The Ka _n_ va text has more correctly, \'He trims\nboth fires;\' since it is the \xc3\x82gnidhra who has to trim both the northern and\nsouthern fires. See par. 29.\n\n[400:2](sbe1257.htm#fr_895) The recipients of the first four fore-offerings\nare the same as at the normal havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a (cf. [p.\n146](sbe1224.htm#page_146) note), viz. 1. the kindling-sticks (samidhs); 2.\nTanunapat (or Nara _s_ a _m_ sa); 3. the I _d_ s; 4. the Barhis. The remaining\nones are--5. the doors (of heaven); 6. dawn and night; 7. the two divine Hot\n_ri_ s; 8. the three goddesses (Sarasvati, I _d_ a, and Bharati); 9. all the\ndeities to whom offering is made during the sacrifice (see I, 5, 3, 22 seq.).\nThe objects of the first eight offerings are identical with those of the first\neight verses of the \xc3\x82pri hymns.\n\n[400:3](sbe1257.htm#fr_896) Or, \'at every fourth (fore-offering)?\' According\nto the Paddhati on Katy. V, 5, the butter is poured together at the fourth and\nseventh praya _g_ as. See also I, 5, 3, 16.\n\n[401:1](sbe1257.htm#fr_897) See I, 6, 1, 20 seq.\n\n[403:1](sbe1257.htm#fr_898) See I, 8, 1, 18-43.\n\n[403:2](sbe1257.htm#fr_899) See II, 5, 2, 19, and I, 8, 2, 3.\n\n[404:1](sbe1257.htm#fr_900) P _ri_ shad-a _g_ ya (lit. mottled butter) is\nclarified butter mixed with sour milk.\n\n[404:2](sbe1257.htm#fr_901) The recipients of the nine after-offerings are as\nfollows: 1. The divine Barhis; 2. the divine doors; 3. the divine dawn and\nnight; 4. the two divine benefactresses ( _g_ osh _t_ ri); 5. the two\ngoddesses of potent sacrifice (ur _g_ ahuti); 6. the two divine Hot _ri_ s; 7.\nthe three goddesses; 8. the divine Nara _s_ a _m_ sa; 9. the divine Agni Svish\n_t_ ak _ri_ t. Cf. p. 400, note .\n\n[404:3](sbe1257.htm#fr_902) See I, 8, 3, 1 seq.\n\n[405:1](sbe1257.htm#fr_903) See I, 8, 3, 10 seq.\n\n[405:2](sbe1257.htm#fr_904) See I, 8, 3, 20 seq.\n\n[405:3](sbe1257.htm#fr_905) In thus briefly recapitulating the chief points of\nthe course of sacrificial performance, the author\'s object is merely to assign\nto each officiating priest--especially to the Adhvaryu and his assistant, the\nPratiprasthat _ri_ \\--his special share of business. In the actual\nperformance, the pronunciation of the formula of \'All-hail and blessing\' (see\nI, 9, 1, 26), of course, comes after the throwing of the enclosing-sticks into\nthe fire (see I, 8, 3, 22).\n\n[405:4](sbe1257.htm#fr_906) See I, 8, 3, 26.\n\n[405:5](sbe1257.htm#fr_907) See I, 9, 2, 1.\n\n[406:1](sbe1257.htm#fr_908) See [p. 390](sbe1256.htm#page_390), note\n[3](sbe1256.htm#fn_875).\n\n[406:2](sbe1257.htm#fr_909) Katy. V, 5, 30-33, and the scholiasts supply the\n[following](errata.htm#10) particulars: The sacrificer and his wife,\naccompanied by the priests, are to repair to some quiet part of flowing water.\nThe Adhvaryu then takes the sacrificer by the arm and makes him enter the\nwater. Thereupon he himself enters, strews sacrificial grass on the water,\nputs a stick on it, and thereon offers a spoonful of butter to Agni. Then\nfollow six oblations, viz. four fore-offerings, performed in the usual way\n(the one to the Barhis being omitted); p. 407 an oblation of butter to Varu\n_n_ a, and another of the scrapings of curds to Agni and Varu _n_ a. Other\nauthorities offer ten oblations instead of six, viz. four fore-offerings, two\n\'butter-portions\' to Agni and Soma, the two oblations to Varu _n_ a and Agni-\nVaru _n_ a, and two after-offerings. The Adhvaryu then immerses the butter-\npot, with the text Va _g_. S. III, 48. Thereupon the sacrificer and his wife\nbathe without diving, but wash each other\'s back. They then come out of the\nwater and put on fresh clothes.\n\n[407:1](sbe1257.htm#fr_910) Viz. by lighting (or heating) at them two ara _n_\nis or churning-sticks, by means of which the fires are transferred to the old\nhearths. According to the Paddhati, the remaining ceremonies of the ish _t_ i,\nfrom the offering of the Barhis (see I, 9, 2, 29) to the end, are performed\npreviously to the lifting of the fires.\n\n[407:2](sbe1257.htm#fr_911) Viz. the full-moon sacrifice, see II, 6, 2, 59,\nwhere, however, agnau instead of agni. The construction here is quite\nirregular. The Ka _n_ va text has: ke _s_ a _s_ ma _s_ ruptvagni samarohayata\nudavasaya hy etena ya _g_ ate.\n\n[407:3](sbe1257.htm#fr_912) That is, to the ordinary sacrificial ground.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 5, 3.
