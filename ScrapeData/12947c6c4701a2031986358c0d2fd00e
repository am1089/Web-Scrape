Narayanasvami Aiyar, [1914], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 124\n\n### \xe1\xb9\xac\xc4\x80RAS\xc4\x80RA-UPANISHA\xe1\xb8\x8c 1\n\n### OF\n\n### \xc5\x9aUKLA-YAJURVE\xe1\xb8\x8cA\n\nOm. B\xe1\xb9\x9bhaspa\xe1\xb9\xadi asked Y\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1avalkya: "That which is called Kurukshe\xe1\xb9\xadra is the\nplace of the sacrifice of the \xe1\xb8\x8cevas and the spiritual seat of all beings.\nTherefore where should one go in order that he may cognize Kurukshe\xe1\xb9\xadra, the\nplace of the sacrifice of the \xe1\xb8\x8cevas and the spiritual seat of all beings?" (To\nwhich Y\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1avalkya replied:) "Avimuk\xe1\xb9\xada 2 is Kurukshe\xe1\xb9\xadra, the place of the\nsacrifice of the \xe1\xb8\x8cevas and of the study of Brahman, because it is there that\nRu\xe1\xb8\x8dra initiates one into the \xe1\xb9\xac\xc4\x81raka 3 Brahman when pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a (life) goes out.\nThrough this, one becomes immortal and the enjoyer of moksha. Therefore one\nshould always be in the midst of that place avimuk\xe1\xb9\xada, and should never leave,\nO reverend sir, avimuk\xe1\xb9\xada." Thus said Y\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1avalkya.\n\nThen Bh\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8dv\xc4\x81ja asked Y\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1avalkya: "What is \xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81raka? what is that which causes\none to cross (this mundane existence)." To which Y\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1avalkya replied: "Om-\nNam\xc5\x8d-N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81ya is the \xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81raka. It should be worshipped as Chi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadma. Om is a\nsingle syllable and of the nature of \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. N amah is of two syllables and is\nof the nature of prak\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadi (matter). N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81yar\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81ya is of five syllables and is of\nthe nature of Parabrahman. He who knows this becomes immortal. Through Om, is\nBrahma produced; through _Na_ is Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u produced; through _Ma_ is Ru\xe1\xb8\x8dra\nproduced; through _N \xc4\x81_ is \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara produced; through _R \xc4\x81_ is the A\xe1\xb9\x87da-Vir\xc4\x81t\n(or Vir\xc4\x81t of the universe) produced; through _Ya_ is\n\np. 125\n\n[paragraph continues] Purusha produced; through _N \xc4\x81_ is Bhagav\xc4\x81n (Lord)\nproduced; and through _Ya_ is Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 produced. This Asht\xc4\x81kshara (eight\nsyllables) of N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a is the supreme and the highest Purusha. Thus is the\n\xe1\xb9\x9agve\xe1\xb8\x8da with the first foot (or half). That which is Om is the indestructible,\nthe supreme, and Brahman. That alone should be worshipped. It is this that is\nof the eight subtle syllables. And this becomes eight, being of eight forms. A\nis the first letter; U is the second; M is the third; Bin\xe1\xb8\x8du is the fourth;\nN\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da is the fifth; Kal\xc4\x81 is the sixth; Kal\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada (that beyond kal\xc4\x81) is the\nseventh; and that which is beyond these is the eighth. It is called \xe1\xb9\xac\xc4\x81raka,\nbecause it enables one to cross this mundane existence. Know that \xe1\xb9\xac\xc4\x81raka alone\nis Brahman and it alone should be worshipped." The (following) verses may be\nquoted here: "From the letter A came Brahm\xc4\x81 named J\xc4\x81mbav\xc4\x81n (the bear 1). From\nthe letter U came Upen\xe1\xb8\x8dra 2, named Hari. From the letter M came \xc5\x9aiva, known as\nHanum\xc4\x81n 3. Bin\xe1\xb8\x8du is named \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara and is \xc5\x9aa\xe1\xb9\xadrughna, the Lord of the discus\nitself. N\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da should be known as the great Lord named Bhara\xe1\xb9\xada and the sound of\nthe conch itself. From Kal\xc4\x81 came the Purusha himself as Lakshma\xe1\xb9\x87a and the\nbearer of the earth. Kal\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada is known as the goddess S\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81 Herself. That which\nis beyond is the Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 named \xc5\x9ar\xc4\xab-R\xc4\x81ma and is the highest Purusha. All this\nis the explanation of the letter Om, which is the past, the present, and\nfuture, and which is other than these ( _viz_.,) \xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva, man\xe1\xb9\xadra, var\xe1\xb9\x87a,\n(colour), \xe1\xb8\x8deva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81 (deity), chhan\xe1\xb8\x8das (metre), \xe1\xb9\x9bk, k\xc4\x81la, \xc5\x9bak\xe1\xb9\xadi, and s\xe1\xb9\x9bshti\n(creation). He who knows this becomes immortal. (Thus is) Yajurve\xe1\xb8\x8da with the\nsecond foot."\n\nThen Bh\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8dv\xc4\x81ja asked Y\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1avalkya: "Through what man\xe1\xb9\xadra is Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 pleased\nand shows his own \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 (to persons)? Please tell this." Y\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1avalkya replied:\n\n"(1st Man\xe1\xb9\xadra:) Om.
