And on account of the prohibition of hearing, studying, and performance\nof (Vedic) matter.\n\nThe _S_ udra is specially forbidden to hear and study the Veda and to perform\nthe things enjoined in it. 'For a _S_ udra is like a cemetery, therefore the\nVeda must not be read in the vicinity of a _S_ udra;' 'Therefore the _S_ udra\nis like a beast, unfit for sacrifices.'
