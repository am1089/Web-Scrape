And that glowing light is (the hymn of) the\nGreat Rite, the Saman-tunes: this is the world of the Saman. And the man in\nyonder orb is the Fire-altar, the Ya _g_ us-formulas: this is the world of the\nYa _g_ us.\n\n10:5:2:22\\. It is this threefold lore that shines, and even they who do not\nknow this say, 'This threefold lore does indeed shine;' for it is Speech that,\nseeing it, speaks thus.\n\n10:5:2:33\\. And that man in yonder (sun's) orb is no other than Death; and\nthat glowing light is that immortal element: therefore Death does not die, for\nhe is within the immortal; and therefore he is not seen, for he is within the\nimmortal 1.\n\n10:5:2:44\\. There is this verse:--'Within Death is immortality,'--for below\ndeath is immortality;--'founded on Death is immortality,'--for established on\nthat man (in the sun) the immortal shines 2;--'Death putteth on the radiant,'\n--the\n\np. 367\n\nradiant one (vivasvant), doubtless, is yonder sun, for he irradiates (vi-vas)\nday and night; and it is him that (Death) puts on, for on every side he is\nsurrounded by him;--'Death's self is in the radiant,'--for the self (body) of\nthat man indeed is in that orb: such, then, is that verse.\n\n10:5:2:55\\. Now, that orb is the foundation (foothold) of both that light and\nthat man; whence one must not recite the Great Litany for another 1, lest he\nshould cut away that foothold from beneath his own self; for he who recites\nthe Mahad Uktham for another, indeed cuts away that foothold from beneath his\nown self: wherefore the (professional) singer of praises ( _s_ astra) is\ngreatly despised, for he is cut off from his foothold. Thus in regard to the\ndeity.\n\n10:5:2:66\\. Now as to the sacrifice. That shining orb is the same as this gold\nplate (under the altar) 2, and that glowing light is the same as this lotus-\nleaf (under the altar); for there are those (divine)\n\np. 368\n\nwaters 1, and the lotus-leaf is water 2; and that man in yonder orb is no\nother than this gold man (in the altar): thus, by laying down these (in the\nfire-altar), it is that (divine) triad he constructs. And after the\nconsummation of the sacrifice it rises upwards and enters that shining (sun):\none need not therefore mind destroying Agni, for he is then in yonder (world)\n3. Thus, then, in regard to the sacrifice.\n\n10:5:2:77\\. Now as to the self (body). That shining orb and that gold plate\nare the same as the white here in the eye; and that glowing light and that\nlotus-leaf are the same as the black here in the eye; and that man in yonder\norb and that gold man are the same as this man in the right eye.\n\np. 369\n\n10:5:2:88\\. The Lokamp _ri_ _n_ a (space-filling brick) is the same as that\n(gold man in the sun) 1: it is that (brick) which this entire Agni finally\nresults in 2. Moreover, this man (or person) in the left eye is the mate of\nthat one (in the right eye and in the sun); and a mate is one half of one's\nown self 3, for when one is with a mate he is whole and complete: thus it (the\nsecond man) is for the sake of completeness. And as to there being two of\nthese (persons in the eyes), a pair means a productive couple: hence two\nLokamp _ri_ _n_ as are laid down each time 4, and hence they set up the layer\nby two (kinds of bricks).\n\n10:5:2:99\\. Now, that person in the right eye is the same as Indra, and (that\nother person is) the same as Indra _n_ i: it is for the sake of these two that\nthe gods made that partition (between the eyes), the nose; whence he (the\nhusband) should not eat food in the presence of his wife 5; for from him (who\n\np. 370\n\ndoes not do so) a vigorous son is born, and she in whose presence (the\nhusband) does not eat food bears a vigorous (son):--\n\n10:5:2:1010\\. Such, indeed, is the divine ordinance;--amongst men princes keep\nmost aloof 1, and for that reason a vigorous (son) is born to them; and of\nbirds the Am _ri_ tavaka (does so, and she) produces the Kshipra _s_ yena 2.\n\n10:5:2:1111\\. Those two (persons in the eyes) descend to the cavity of the\nheart 3, and enter into union with each other; and when they reach the end of\ntheir union, then the man sleeps,--even as here on reaching the end of a human\nunion he becomes, as it were, insensible 4, so does he then become, as it\nwere,\n\np. 371\n\ninsensible; for this is a divine union 1, and that is the highest bliss.\n\n10:5:2:1212\\. Therefore let him, who knows this, sleep, for it makes for\nheaven 2: he thereby, indeed, makes those two deities enjoy their dear wish,\nunion. And one should not therefore forcibly 3 awaken him who sleeps, lest he\nshould hurt those two deities whilst enjoying their union; and hence the mouth\nof him who has been asleep is, as it were, clammy, for those two deities are\nthen shedding seed, and from that seed everything here originates, whatsoever\nexists.\n\n10:5:2:1313\\. Now, that man in yonder orb (of the sun), and that man in the\nright eye truly are no other than Death;--his feet have stuck fast in the\nheart, and having pulled them out he comes forth; and when he comes forth then\nthat man dies: whence they say of him who has passed away, 'he has been cut\noff 4.'\n\n10:5:2:1414\\. And, indeed, he is the breath (pra _n_ a), for it is he (the man\nin the eye) that leads forward (pra _n_ ayati) all these creatures. These\nvital airs (pra _n_ a) are his own (sva); and when he sleeps (svapiti) then\n\np. 372\n\nthese vital airs take possession of him 1 as his own (sva api-yanti): hence\n(the term) 'svapyaya (being taken possession of by one's own people),'\n'svapyaya' doubtless being what they mystically call 'svapna (sleep),' for the\ngods love the mystic.\n\n10:5:2:1515\\. And when he is asleep, he does not, by means of them, know of\nanything whatever, nor does he form any resolution with his mind, or\ndistinguish the taste of food with (the channel of) his speech, or distinguish\nany smell with (the channel of) his breath; neither does he see with his eye,\nnor hear with his ear, for those (vital airs) have taken possession of him.\nWhilst being one only, he (the man in the eye) is numerously distributed among\nliving beings: whence the Lokamp _ri_ _n_ a (representing the man in the sun),\nwhilst being one only (in kind), extends over the whole altar; and because he\n(the man in the eye) is one only, therefore (the Lokamp _ri_ _n_ a) is one.\n\n10:5:2:1616\\. As to this they say, 'One death, or many?' Let him say, 'Both\none and many;' for inasmuch as he is that (man in the sun) in yonder world he\nis one, and inasmuch as he is numerously distributed here on earth among\nliving beings, there are also many of them.\n\n10:5:2:1717\\. As to this they say, 'Is Death near or far away?' Let him say,\n'Both near and far away;' for inasmuch as he is here on earth in the body he\nis near, and inasmuch as he is that one in yonder world he also is far away.\n\n10:5:2:1818\\. Regarding this there is the verse,--'Concealed\n\np. 373\n\nin food he, the immortal, shineth at the flowing together of vital saps;'--\nyonder shining orb is food, and the man in that orb is the eater: being\nconcealed in that food, he shines. Thus much as to the deity.\n\n10:5:2:1919\\. Now as to the body. This body indeed is food, and that man in\nthe right eye is the eater: being concealed in that food he shines.\n\n10:5:2:2020\\. That same (divine person), the Adhvaryus (Ya _g_ ur-veda\npriests) serve under the name of 'Agni' (fire-altar) and 'Ya _g_ us,' because\nhe holds together (yu _g_ ) all this (universe) 1; the _Kh_ andogas (Sama-veda\npriests, chanters) under that of 'Saman,' because in him all this (universe)\nis one and the same (samana) 2; the Bahv _ri_ _k_ as ( _Ri_ g-veda priests,\nHotars) under that of 'Uktham,' because he originates (utthap) everything\nhere; those skilled in sorcery, under that of 'sorcery (yatu),' because\neverything here is held in check (yata) by him; the serpents under that of\n'poison;' the snake-charmers under that of 'snake;' the gods under that of 'ur\n_g_ (strengthening food);' men under that of 'wealth;' demons under that of\n'maya (magic power);' the deceased Fathers under that of 'svadha (invigorating\ndraught);' those knowing the divine host under that of 'divine host;' the\nGandharvas under that of 'form (rupa 3);' the Apsaras under that of 'fragrance\n(gandha),'--thus, in whatsoever form they serve him that indeed he becomes,\nand, having become that,\n\np. 374\n\nhe is helpful to them; whence he who knows should serve him in all these\n(forms), for he becomes all that, and, having become all that, he is helpful\nto him.\n\n10:5:2:2121\\. Now this Agni (fire-altar) consists of three bricks,--the _Ri_\n_k_ being one, the Ya _g_ us another, and the Saman another: whatever (brick)\nhe lays down here with a _ri_ k (verse) that has the gold plate for its\nfoundation 1; whatever (brick he lays down) with a ya _g_ us (formula) that\nhas the (gold) man for its foundation; and whatever (brick he lays down) with\na saman (hymn-tune) that has the lotus-leaf for its foundation. Thus he\nconsists of three bricks.\n\n10:5:2:2222\\. And, indeed, these two, to wit, that gold plate and that lotus-\nleaf join that (gold) man, for both the _Ri_ _k_ and the Saman join the Ya _g_\nus; and so he also consists of a single brick.\n\n10:5:2:2323\\. Now, that man in yonder orb (of the sun), and this man in the\nright eye, are no other than Death 2; and he becomes the body (self) of him\nwho knows this: whenever he who knows departs this world he passes into that\nbody, and becomes immortal, for Death is his own self.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[366:1](sbe4367.htm#fr_727) M _ri_ tyurupa _h_ purusho\xe0\xa4\xbdm _ri_ tarupes\xe0\xa4\xbdr _k_\nishy antar vartate, . . . m _ri_ tyo _h_ purushasya am _ri_ tam am _ri_\ntarupar _k_ ir adhikara _n_ a _m_ ma _n_ _d_ alam ahitam pratish _th_ itam.\nSaya _n_ a.\n\n[366:2](sbe4367.htm#fr_728) 'Antarara _m_ m _ri_ tyor am _ri_ tam ity avara\n_m_ hy etan m _ri_ tyor am _ri_ tam' ity adina, avaram adhastadbhavam am _ri_\nta _m_ purusha _h_ p. 367 parastad ity arthasiddha _h_ ; anena am _ri_\ntamadhyavartitvam uktam ity artha _h_ ; dvitiyapadagatam _ri_ tapadenar _k_ ir\nadhikara _n_ a _m_ ma _n_ _d_ alam u _k_ yate, tat purushe pratish _th_ ita\n_m_ tapati, tena hi tasya ma _n_ _d_ alasya _g_ agatpraka _s_ akatvam asti.\nSay. But for this interpretation, one might have rendered the first pada by,\n'Close unto death is immortality,' for after death comes immortality.\n\n[367:1](sbe4367.htm#fr_729) Cf. Aitareyar. V, 3, 3, 1, 'No one but a dikshita\n(initiated) should recite the Mahavrata ( _s_ astra); and he should not recite\nit at a (Mahavrata) unless it be combined with (the building of) a fire-altar;\nneither should he do so for another person, nor at a (sacrificial session\nlasting) less than a year,' so say some; but he may recite it for his father\nor for his teacher, for in that case it is recited on his own behalf.\n\n[367:2](sbe4367.htm#fr_730) In these symbolical identifications, one might\nalso take the relative clause to be the predicate, not the subject, of the\nsentence; the former usually preceding the latter.\n\n[368:1](sbe4367.htm#fr_731) Though the sun itself does not consist of water,\nhe at any rate floats along a sea of water; cf. VII, 5, 1, 8, 'For that indeed\nis the deepest of waters where yonder sun shines;' and there are waters above\nand below the sun, VII, 1, 1, 24; and the sun is encircled by 360 navigable\nstreams, and as many flow towards it, [X, 5, 4, 14](sbe4369.htm#10:5:4:14).--\nSaya _n_ a, on the other hand, takes it to mean, 'for that (light) is water,'\ninasmuch as the sun's rays produce the rain,--ar _k_ isho hy apa _h_ suryakira\n_n_ anam eva v _ri_ sh _t_ ikart _ri_ katvat karyakaranayor abhedena ar _k_ ir\nva apa ity uktam. Possibly this may be the right interpretation.\n\n[368:2](sbe4367.htm#fr_732) See VII, 4, 1, 8, where the lotus-plant is said to\nrepresent the (cosmic) waters, whilst the earth is a lotus-leaf floating on\nthe waters.\n\n[368:3](sbe4367.htm#fr_733) According to Saya _n_ a, he is so in the shape of\nboth the sun and the Sacrificer's body or self,--yato\xe0\xa4\xbdsminn agni _m_ _k_\nitavan paratradityo bhavati, ato\xe0\xa4\xbdgni _m_ parihantu _m_ nadriyeta, _k_ i _t_ am\nagnim ish _t_ akavi _s_ eshe _n_ a na _s_ ayitam adara _m_ na _k_ uryat, kuta\n_h_ , esho\xe0\xa4\xbdgnir amutra bhavati, paraloke ya _g_ amana _s_ ariratmanotpadyate;\nyad va parihantu _m_ praptu _m_ sprash _t_ um ity artha _h_ , _k_ ityagnispar\n_s_ ane dosha _s_ rava _n_ at. Saya _n_ a, thus, is doubtful as to how 'Agnim\nparihantum' is to be taken, whether it means 'to injure the altar (? or\nextinguish the fire) by some brick,' or to 'knock against (touch) the altar.'\nThe St. Petersb. Dict. takes it in the sense of 'to extinguish the fire,' p.\n369 but it might also, perhaps, mean, 'to destroy the fire-altar' by taking it\nto pieces.\n\n[369:1](sbe4367.htm#fr_734) On the identification of the sun with the Lokamp\n_ri_ _n_ a on the ground that the former fills these worlds (lokan purayati),\nsee [VIII, 7, 2, 1](sbe4327.htm#8:7:2:1).\n\n[369:2](sbe4367.htm#fr_735) Or, finally comes to; viz. inasmuch as it is by\nthe placing of the Lokamp _ri_ _n_ a bricks that the altar is completed\n(Say.); and inasmuch as Agni passes into the sun.\n\n[369:3](sbe4367.htm#fr_736) Purusho mithuna _m_ yoshid ity etasmin mithuna _m_\nhy atmano\xe0\xa4\xbdrdham ardhabhaga _h_ , ardho va esha atmano yat patniti taittiriya\n_s_ rute _h_. Say.\n\n[369:4](sbe4367.htm#fr_737) When the layers are filled up with 'space-\nfillers,' two Lokamp _ri_ _n_ as are first laid down in one of the four\ncorners, and from them the available spaces are then filled up, in two turns,\nin the sunwise direction; cf. [p. 22](sbe4306.htm#page_22), note\n[1](sbe4307.htm#fn_73).\n\n[369:5](sbe4367.htm#fr_738) Cf. I, 9, 2, 12, 'whenever women here eat, they do\nso apart from men;' where the use of the ' _g_ ighatsanti' (swallow their p.\n370 food)--as against a _s_ niyat in our passage--is not meant\ndisrespectfully, but as the regular desiderative of 'ad' (Pa _n_. II, 4, 37),\nfor which no doubt 'a _s_ i _s_ ishanti' (Sat. Br. III, 1, 2, 1) might have\nbeen used.\n\n[370:1](sbe4367.htm#fr_739) Or, 'act most in secrecy.' Saya _n_ a explains it:\nmanushya _n_ a _m_ madhye ra _g_ anyabandhavo\xe0\xa4\xbdnutama _m_ gopayanti atyartha\n_m_ rahasyatvena kurvanti tasmat teshu viryavan putro _g_ ayate. The St.\nPetersb. Dict., on the other hand, takes it in the sense of 'they protect most\nof all;' though it is difficult to see how the, 'protection' afforded by\nprinces or rulers could have any bearing on men taking their food apart from\ntheir wives. If the above interpretation is right we may compare 'anu-gup' in\nthe sense of 'to conceal.' See, however, the next note, where Saya _n_ a takes\n'gopayati' in the sense of 'observes (that law),' which might also have suited\nhere. Princes, having their seraglio, would naturally have less occasion for\ncoming into contact with their wives at mealtime than men of lower stations of\nlife. On the superlative of the preposition, see [p.\n287](sbe4346.htm#page_287), note [1](sbe4346.htm#fn_531).\n\n[370:2](sbe4367.htm#fr_740) ? The swift eagle,--vayasam pakshi _n_ am madhye\nam _ri_ tavaka nama pakshi _g_ atir etad vrata _m_ gopayati, ata _h_ sa\nkshipra _m_ _s_ ighragamina _m_ _s_ yena _m_ nama pakshi _n_ a _m_ _g_\nanayati. Say.\n\n[370:3](sbe4367.htm#fr_741) H _ri_ dayasyaka _s_ a _m_ daharam prapya. Say.\n\n[370:4](sbe4367.htm#fr_742) That is, 'unconscious,' with something of\n'indifferent, apathetic,' implied:--Loke manushasya maithunasyanta _m_ gatva\xe0\xa4\xbd\nsa _m_ vida p. 371 a _g_ ananeva nra stri bhavati (marg. corr. a _g_ ananav\neva stripurushau bhavata _h_ ) eva _m_ tada tayor mithunabhave (?\nmithunabhave) purusho\xe0\xa4\xbdsa _m_ vida iva bhavati. Say.\n\n[371:1](sbe4367.htm#fr_743) Viz. because it is the union of Indra and Indra\n_n_ i.\n\n[371:2](sbe4367.htm#fr_744) Or, perhaps, it is the usual practice (lokyam), as\nthe St. Petersb. Dict. takes it.\n\n[371:3](sbe4367.htm#fr_745) Dhureva pi _d_ ayaiva na bodhayet, na prabuddha\n_m_ kuryat, dhurvater hi _m_ sarthat kvipi _t_ ablope rupam. Say.\n\n[371:4](sbe4367.htm#fr_746) ? His (life) has been cut off; or, his (life-\nstring) has been severed. Saya _n_ a (unless there is an omission in the MS.)\ndoes not explain ' _k_ a _kh_ edy asya,' but seems to take 'pretam' (passed\naway) as the word on which the stress lies:--tasmad imam pretam ity ahu _h_ ,\nprapurvad ete _h_ ktapratyaye rupam; katham, akshipurushanirgame purushasya\nmara _n_ am.\n\n[372:1](sbe4367.htm#fr_747) Or, they keep within him, they nestle in him,--\napiyanti prapnuvanti, aliyanta ity artha _h_. Say.\n\n[373:1](sbe4367.htm#fr_748) Esha purusha ida _m_ sarva _m_ _g_ agad yunakti\nsarvatra svaya _m_ sa _m_ gata iti. Say.\n\n[373:2](sbe4367.htm#fr_749) Etasmin paramatmani kara _n_ e sarva _m_ karya _g_\nata _m_ samanam iti. Say.\n\n[373:3](sbe4367.htm#fr_750) The characteristic attributes of the Gandharvas\nand Apsaras are evidently exchanged in the text as it stands; cf. [IX, 4, 1,\n4](sbe4339.htm#9:4:1:4).\n\n[374:1](sbe4367.htm#fr_751) Viz. inasmuch as the (round) gold plate\n(representing the sun) is deposited in the centre of the altar-site, before\nthe first layer is constructed. In the same way the other two objects.\n\n[374:2](sbe4367.htm#fr_752) Saya _n_ a seems to construe this somewhat\ndifferently: sa esho gnir ya _g_ uratmako\xe0\xa4\xbddhidaiva _m_ ma _n_ _d_\nalamadhyavarti adhyatma _m_ dakshi _n_ akshivarti purusho m _ri_ tyurupa _h_.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: X, 5, 3.
