The Samidhs (kindlers), doubtless, are the breaths (vital\nairs), and he thereby kindles the breaths; for this man (the sacrificer) is\nkindled (animated) by his breaths: hence if he (the sacrificer) be burning\n(with fever, &c.), he (the Adhvaryu) will say, 'Stroke (thyself)!' If he be\nhot, then one may feel confident, for then he is kindled; and if he be cold,\nthen one need hope no longer. Thus he thereby puts the breaths into him: this\nis the reason why he pronounces the prayer to the Samidhs.\n\n1:5:4:22\\. He then pronounces the offering-prayer to Tanunapat. Tanunapat,\ndoubtless, is seed; hence he thereby casts seed: this is why he pronounces the\nprayer to Tanunapat.\n\np. 153\n\n1:5:4:33\\. He then pronounces the offering-prayer to the I _d_ s. The I _d_ s,\ndoubtless, are offspring; when the seed thus cast springs into life, then it\nmoves about in quest of food, as it were, praising (i _d_ ). Hence he thereby\nmakes him (the sacrificer) propagate offspring: this is the reason why he,\npronounces the prayer to the I _d_ s.\n\n1:5:4:44\\. He then pronounces the offering-prayer to the Barhis. The barhis,\ndoubtless, means abundance, hence he thereby produces an abundance: this is\nwhy he pronounces the prayer to the barhis.\n\n1:5:4:55\\. He then pronounces the offering-prayer with 'Svaha! Svaha!' The\nSvaha-call, indeed, is what the winter is among the seasons; for the winter\nsubjects these creatures to its will: hence in winter the plants wither, and\nthe leaves fall off the trees; the birds retire more and more, and fly lower\nand lower; and the wicked man has his hair, as it were, falling off 1; for the\nwinter subjects these creatures to its will. And, verily, he who knows this,\nmakes that locality wherein he lives, his own, for his own happiness and\nsupply of food.\n\n1:5:4:66\\. The gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra _g_ apati,\nwere once contending for superiority. With staves and bows neither party were\nable to overcome the other. Neither of them having gained the victory, they\n(the Asuras) said, 'Well then, let us try to overcome one another by speech,\nby sacred writ (brahman)! He who cannot follow up our uttered speech by\n(making up) a pair, shall be defeated and lose everything, and the other party\n\np. 154\n\nshall win everything!' The gods replied, 'So be it!' The gods said to Indra,\n'Speak thou!'\n\n1:5:4:77\\. Indra said, 'One (eka, m., unus) for me!' The others then said,\n'One (eka, f., una) for us!' and thus found that (desired) pair, for eka\n(unus) and eka (una) make a pair.\n\n1:5:4:88\\. Indra said, 'Two (dvau, m., duo) for me!' The others then said,\n'Two (dve, f., duae) for us!' and thus found that pair, for dvau (duo) and dve\n(duae) make a pair.\n\n1:5:4:99\\. Indra said, 'Three (traya _h_ , m.) for me!' The others then said,\n'Three (tisra _h_ , f.) for us!' and thus found that pair, for traya _h_. and\ntisra _h_ make a pair.\n\n1:5:4:1010\\. Indra said, 'Four ( _k_ atvara _h_ , m.) for me!' The others then\nsaid, 'Four ( _k_ atasra _h_ , f.) for us!' and thus found that pair, for _k_\natvara _h_ and _k_ atasra _h_ make a pair.\n\n1:5:4:1111\\. Indra said, 'Five (pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a, m. f., quinque) for me!' Then\nthe others found no pair, for after that (numeral four) there is no pair, for\nthen both (masculine and feminine) are pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a. Thereupon the Asuras were\ndefeated and lost everything, and the gods won everything from the Asuras, and\nstripped their rivals, the Asuras, of everything.\n\n1:5:4:1212\\. For this reason let him (the sacrificer) say 1, when the first\nfore-offering has been performed, 'One (eka) for me!' and 'One (eka) for him\nwhom\n\np. 155\n\nwe hate!' And if he should not hate any one, let him say, 'who hates us and\nwhom we hate!'\n\n1:5:4:1313\\. With the second fore-offering, 'Two (dvau) for me!' and 'Two\n(dve) for him who hates us and whom we hate!'\n\n1:5:4:1414\\. With the third fore-offering, 'Three (traya _h_ ) for me!' and\n'Three (tisra _h_ ) for him who hates us and whom we hate!'\n\n1:5:4:1515\\. With the fourth fore-offering, 'Four (katvara _h_ ) for me!' and\n'Four ( _k_ atasra _h_ ) for him who hates us and whom we hate!'\n\n1:5:4:1616\\. With the fifth fore-offering, 'Five (pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a) for me!' and\n'Nothing for him who hates us and whom we hate!' For, there being 'five' to\nfive,' he (the enemy) is defeated, and whoever knows this, appropriates to\nhimself everything that belongs to that (enemy of his), strips his enemies of\neverything.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[153:1](sbe1225.htm#fr_368) The Ka _n_ va recension has, 'the beasts retire\nmore and more, and the birds fly lower and lower; and the vile-caste man\n(papavar _n_ a _h_ purusha _h_ ) has his hair, as it were, falling off.'\n\n[154:1](sbe1225.htm#fr_369) Viz. as anumantra _n_ a, or after-call,\nsupplementary prayer, pronounced immediately after the oblation has been\npoured into the fire.
