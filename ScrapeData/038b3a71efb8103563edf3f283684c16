From first to last  \nThine ears have heard whate\'er has past.  \nRama the mighty lord and I  \nFor refuge to Sugriva fly.  \nThe prince whose arm bright glory gained.  \nO\'er the whole earth as monarch reigned,  \nAnd richest gifts to others gave,  \nIs come Sugriva\'s help to crave;  \nSon of a king the surest friend  \nOf virtue, him who loved to lend  \nHis succour to the suffering weak,  \nIs come Sugriva\'s aid to seek.  \nYes, Raghu\'s son whose matchless hand  \nProtected all this sea-girt land,  \nThe virtuous prince, my holy guide,  \nFor refuge seeks Sugriva\'s side.  \nHis favour sent on great and small  \nShould ever save and prosper all.  \nHe now to win Sugriva\'s grace  \nHas sought his woodland dwelling-place.  \n\np. 328  \n\nSon of a king of glorious fame;--  \nWho knows not Das\'aratha\'s name?--  \nFrom whom all princes of the earth  \nReceived each honour due to worth;--  \nHeir of that best of earthly kings,  \nRama the prince whose glory rings  \nThrough realms below and earth and skies,  \nFor refuge to Sugriva flies.  \nNor should the Vanar king refuse  \nThe boon for which the suppliant sues,  \nBut with his forest legions speed  \nTo save him in his utmost need.  \n   Sumitra\'s son, his eyes bedewed  \nWith piteous tears, thus sighed and sued.  \nThen, trained in all the arts that guide  \nThe speaker, Hanuman replied:  \n   \'Yea, lords like you of wisest thought,  \nWhom happy fate has hither brought,  \nWho vanquish ire and rule each sense,  \nMust of our lord have audience.  \nReft of his kingdom, sad, forlorn,  \nOnce Bali\'s hate now Bali\'s scorn,  \nDefeated, severed from his spouse,  \nWandering under forest boughs,  \nChild of the Sun, our lord and king  \nSugriva will his succours bring,  \nAnd all our Vanar hosts combined  \nWill trace the dame you long to find.\'  \n   With gentle tone and winning grace  \nThus spake the chief of Vanar race,  \nAnd then to Raghu\'s son he cried:  \n\'Come, haste we to Sugriva\'s side.\'  \n   He spoke, and for his words so sweet  \nGood Lakshman\' paid all honour meet;  \nThen turned and cried to Raghu\'s son:  \n\'Now deem thy task already done,  \nBecause this chief of Vanar kind,  \nSon of the God who rules the wind,  \nDeclares Sugriva\'s self would be  \nAssisted in his need by thee.  \nBright gleams of joy his cheek o\'erspread  \nAs each glad word of hope he said;  \nAnd ne\'er will one so valiant deign  \nTo cheer our hearts with hope in vain.\'  \n   He spoke, and Hanuman the wise  \nCast off his mendicant disguise,  \nAnd took again his Vanar form,  \nSon of the God of wind and storm.  \nHigh on his ample back in haste  \nBaghu\'s heroic sons he placed.  \nAnd turned with rapid steps to find  \nThe sovereign of the Vanar kind.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[327:1](ry278.htm#fr_550) "In our own metrical romances, or wherever a poem is\nmeant not for readers but for chanters and oral reciters, these _formulae_ ,\nto meet the same recurring case, exist by scores.
