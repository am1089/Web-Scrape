Hear me explain (this), O king! have no misgiving about it\n3. Both truths, O Kshatriya! have been current from the beginning 4. The wise\nmaintain what (is called) delusion (to be) death. I 5 verily call heedlessness\ndeath, and likewise I call freedom from heedlessness immortality. Through\nheedlessness, verily, were the demons 6 vanquished; and through freedom\n\np. 153\n\nfrom heedlessness the gods attained to the Brahman. Death, verily, does not\ndevour living creatures like a tiger; for, indeed, his form is not to be\nperceived. Some 1 say that death is different from this, (named) Yama, who\ndwells in the self 2 the (practice of the) life of Brahma _k_ arins (being)\nimmortality. That god governs his kingdom in the world of the Pit _ri_ s,\n(being) good to the good, and not good to (those who are) not good. That\ndeath, (or) heedlessness, develops in men as desire, and afterwards as wrath,\nand in the shape of delusion 3. And then travelling in devious paths 4 through\negoism, one does not attain to union 5 with the self. Those who are deluded by\nit 6, and who remain under its influence, depart from this (world), and there\nagain fall down 7. Then, the deities 8 gather around them. And then he\nundergoes death after death 9. Being attached to the fruit of action, on\naction presenting itself, they follow after it 10, and do not cross\n\np. 154\n\nbeyond death. And the embodied (self), in consequence of not understanding\nunion 1 with the real entity, proceeds on all hands 2 with attachment to\nenjoyments. That 3, verily, is the great source of delusion to the senses; for\nby contact 4 with unreal entities, his migrations 5 are (rendered) inevitable;\nbecause having his inner self contaminated by contact with unreal entities, he\ndevotes himself to objects of sense on all sides, pondering on them (only).\n(That) pondering, verily, first. ruins 6 him; and soon afterwards desire and\nwrath, after attacking him. These 7 lead children to death. But sensible men\ncross beyond death by their good sense. He who pondering (on the self)\ndestroys 8 (the) fugitive (objects of sense), not even thinking of them\nthrough contempt (for them), and who being possessed of knowledge destroys\ndesires in this way, becomes, as it were, the death of death (itself), and\nswallows (it) up 9. The being who\n\np. 155\n\npursues desires, is destroyed (in pursuing) after the desires 1. But casting\naway desires, a being gets rid of all taint 2 whatever, This body, void of\nenlightenment 3, seems (to be) a hell for (all) beings. Those who are\navaricious run about 4, going headlong to a ditch. A man, O Kshatriya! who\ncontemns everything else 5 learns nothing. To him (the body is) like a tiger\nmade of straw 6. And this internal self (joined to) delusion and fear 7 in\nconsequence of wrath and avarice, within your body, that verily is death 8.\nUnderstanding death 9 to be thus produced, and adhering to knowledge, one is\nnot afraid of death 10 in this (world). In his province death is destroyed, as\na mortal (is destroyed) on arriving in the province of death.\n\nDh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra said:\n\nThe good, eternal, and most holy worlds 11, which\n\np. 156\n\nare mentioned (as attainable) by the twice-born by means of worship 1, those,\nsay the Vedas, are the highest aim 2. How is it, then, that one who\nunderstands this does not resort to action?\n\nSanatsu _g_ ata said!\n\n(Thinking) so, an ignorant man does resort to action. The Vedas likewise do\nlay down various benefits 3 (for him). But that 4 (man) comes not hither 5.\n(Becoming) the supreme self 6, he attains the supreme, by the (right) path\ndestroying the wrong paths 7.\n\nDh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra said:\n\nWho 8 is it that constrains this unborn primeval (self), if it is (itself).\nall this severally 9? And what\n\np. 157\n\nhas it to do, or what is its unhappiness 1? Tell me all that accurately, O\nlearned person!\n\nSanatsu _g_ ata said:\n\nThere is great danger 2 in attributing distinctions to it. The everlasting 3\n(principles) exist by connexion with the beginningless 4 (principle). So that\nhis greatness is not lost at all 5, and beings exist by connexion with the\nbeginningless 4 (principle). That which is the real--the supreme Being 6\\--is\neternal. He creates the universe by means of changes 7, for such is his power\nheld to be; and for such connexions of things the Vedas are (authority) 8.\n\np. 158\n\nDh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra said:\n\nSince some practise piety 1 in this world, and some likewise practise impiety\nin this world; is the piety destroyed by the sin, or else. does the piety\ndestroy sin?\n\nSanatsu _g_ ata said:\n\nWhichever 2 he adheres to, the man of understanding always destroys both by\nmeans of knowledge; (that is) settled 3. Likewise, in the other case 4, the\nembodied (self) obtains merit; and to such a one sin (also) accrues; (that too\nis) settled 3. Departing (from this world), he enjoys by his actions both\n(kinds of) fruit, which are not enduring 5\\--of actions (which are) pure, and\nof (those which are) sinful. The man of understanding casts aside sin by piety\nin this (world), for know that his piety is more powerful 6. Those Brahma _n_\nas, in whom there is emulation 7 about (their) piety, as there is in strong\nmen about (their) strength, after departing from this world, become glorious\nin heaven 8. And\n\np. 159\n\nto those in whom there is no emulation about (their) piety, that (piety) is a\nmeans of (acquiring) knowledge 1. Such Brahma _n_ as released from this\n(world), go to the heaven which is free from the threefold source of pain 2.\nPeople who understand the Vedas call his conduct good. (But) people closely\nconnected 3, as well as strangers, do not pay much regard to him. Wherever he\nmay believe food and drink for a Brahma _n_ a to exist in abundance, like\nwater on grass in the autumn, there would he live and not be vexed 4. (To him)\nonly that person is good, and no other (as a companion), who does nothing in\nexcess, and who occasions fear and injury to a taciturn man 5. And his food is\nacceptable to the good, who does not vex the self of a taciturn man, and who\ndoes not destroy the property of a Brahma _n_ a 6. A Brahma _n_ a should hold,\nthat living in the midst of kinsmen, his actions should be always unknown 7;\nand he should not\n\np. 160\n\nthink 1 (about them). What Brahma _n_ a ought to think of the inner self,\nwhich is void of symbols 2, immovable, pure, and free from all pairs of\nopposites, in this way 3? What sin is not committed by that thief, who steals\naway his own self 4, who regards his self as one thing, when it is a different\nthing. The far-seeing Brahma _n_ a, who knows the Brahman, is not wearied 5,\nhe receives nothing 6; he is honoured, free from trouble 7, and wise, but acts\nas if he was not wise 8. As dogs eat what is vomited, so do they, enjoying\ntheir own bravery 9, eat what is vomited, always with disaster (to\nthemselves). Those twice-born persons, who are not\n\np. 161\n\nfirst 1 in respect of human wealth, but who are first in the Vedas 2, are\nunconquerable, not to be shaken 3; they should be understood to be forms of\nthe Brahman. Whosoever may in this (world) know all the gods 4\\---doers of\nfavours--he is not equal to a Brahma _n_ a, (nor even) he, 5 for whom he\nexerts himself. The man who makes no efforts 6, and is respected, does not,\nbeing respected, think himself. respected 7, nor does he become vexed in\nconsequence of disrespect. One who is respected 8 should think it to be a\nnatural operation of people, like their opening or closing of the eyelids,\nthat the learned respect him in this world. One who is not respected should\nthink, that the deluded people who do not understand piety, and who are devoid\nof (knowledge of) the world and the Sastras, will never respect one who is\nworthy of respect. Respect and taciturnity 9, verily, never dwell together;\nfor this world is (the field) for respect, the next for taciturnity, as is\nunderstood 10. For worldly wealth dwells in the\n\np. 162\n\nsphere of respect [1](sbe0824.htm#fn_705), and that, too, is an obstacle\n[2](sbe0824.htm#fn_706). While the Brahmic wealth [3](sbe0824.htm#fn_707), O\nKshatriya! is difficult to be attained by any one devoid of knowledge. The\nways (to it) are stated by the good to be of various descriptions, and\ndifficult to reach--truth, straightforwardness, modesty\n[4](sbe0824.htm#fn_708), restraint (of senses), purity, knowledge, which are\nthe six impediments (in the way) of respect and delusion.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[151:1](sbe0822.htm#fr_614) Comp. Gita passim; disgust, scil. that resulting\nfrom a general dissatisfaction with everything. As to \'ruin and prosperity,\'\nNilaka _nth_ a adds, \'and their causes, sin and merit.\'\n\n[151:2](sbe0823.htm#fr_615) Literally \'respected.\' Nilaka _nth_ a says it\nmeans rejoiced over, for Dh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra thought, that, in spite of his\ntreachery he was safe, as death was taught by Sanatsu _g_ ata to have no\nexistence.\n\n[151:3](sbe0823.htm#fr_616) I. e. free from the presence of ignorant and\nvulgar people. Cf. Gita, [p. 68](sbe0808.htm#page_68) supra.\n\n[151:4](sbe0823.htm#fr_617) I. e. knowledge concerning the supreme Self.\n\n[151:5](sbe0823.htm#fr_618) _S_ a _n_ kara\'s construction seems different, but\nis not quite clear. He says, \'wishing to become--Brahman--the meaning is\nwishing to acquire the self lost through ignorance.\'\n\n[151:6](sbe0823.htm#fr_619) I. e. imparted to your pupils, _S_ a _n_ kara\nadds; \'heard,\' scil. from Vidura.\n\n[151:7](sbe0823.htm#fr_620) The construction is imperfect, but the sense is\nclear: is your p. 152 view correct, or the view involved in the practice of\ngods and demons?\n\n[152:1](sbe0823.htm#fr_621) See Gita, [p. 69](sbe0808.htm#page_69) supra; Ka\n_th_ opanishad, p. 102; Pra _s_ na, p. 162. As to the gods being afraid of\ndeath, see _Kh_ andogya, p. 50; and N _ri_ si _m_ ha Tapini, p. 32; and as to\ngods and demons practising the life of Brahma _k_ arins, see _Kh_ andogya, p.\n571; and cf. B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p. 964.\n\n[152:2](sbe0823.htm#fr_622) I. e. action prescribed in the Vedas.\n\n[152:3](sbe0823.htm#fr_623) I. e. as to how I shall be able to reconcile the\nseeming contradiction between the \'two truths.\'\n\n[152:4](sbe0823.htm#fr_624) I. e. of creation.\n\n[152:5](sbe0823.htm#fr_625) Sanatsu _g_ ata says he differs from \'the wise;\'\ndelusion = thinking the not-self to be the self; heedlessness = falling off\nfrom one\'s natural condition as the Brahman--which is the cause of delusion (\n_S_ a _n_ kara). See p. 153 infra; Ka _th_ a, 152; and Taittiriya-upanishad,\np. 80.\n\n[152:6](sbe0823.htm#fr_626) _S_ a _n_ kara suggests that demons might mean\ncreatures attached to worldly objects; and gods those who are pleased in their\nown self; and he cites a stanza in support of this suggestion. The allusion,\nhowever, seems to be plainly to the story at _Kh_ andogya, p. 571 seq., where\nthe idea and expression of \'being vanquished\' also occurs (p. 583). That word\n_S_ a _n_ kara interprets in connexion with his suggested interpretation to\nmean \'are born in lower species.\' See _Kh_ andogya, p. 585, and Maitri, p.\n211, about asuras or demons. It is interesting to note that in the\nIntroduction to the Mahabhashya, there is an allusion to a story of the\n\'demons\' being \'vanquished\' in consequence of their grammatical blunders.\n\n[153:1](sbe0823.htm#fr_627) Those deluded by worldly objects; \'this\' means\n\'heedlessness.\'\n\n[153:2](sbe0823.htm#fr_628) _S_ a _n_ kara cites a stanza from Manu, which\nsays that king Yama Vaivasvata dwells in the heart of every one. Cf. Aitareya-\nupanishad, p. 187. The following clause he understands to contain two epithets\nof Yama, meaning \'immortal, and intent on the Brahman.\' I follow Nilaka _nth_\na, but not very confidently.\n\n[153:3](sbe0823.htm#fr_629) Here we have the developments, the varying forms,\nof death or heedlessness.\n\n[153:4](sbe0823.htm#fr_630) Cf. Gita, [p. 57](sbe0805.htm#page_57). I. e.\npaths contrary to _S_ rutis and _S_ m _ri_ tis.\n\n[153:5](sbe0823.htm#fr_631) Concentration of mind on the self or Brahman.\n\n[153:6](sbe0823.htm#fr_632) I. e. the egoism spoken of before.\n\n[153:7](sbe0823.htm#fr_633) I. e. to this mortal world. Cf. Gita, [p.\n84](sbe0811.htm#page_84), and B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, pp. 855, 856. There =\nfrom the next world. _S_ a _n_ kara says, \'having lived there.\'\n\n[153:8](sbe0823.htm#fr_634) I.e. the senses. Cf. Gita, [p.\n123](sbe0820.htm#page_123), and inter alia \xc3\x8e _s_ opanishad, p. 10.\n\n[153:9](sbe0823.htm#fr_635) Cf. Ka _th_ a, p. 129, and B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka,\np. 889.\n\n[153:10](sbe0823.htm#fr_636) I. e. the fruit. Cf. Ka _th_ a, p. 155, and Mu\n_nd_ aka, p. 317.\n\n[154:1](sbe0823.htm#fr_637) I. e. its identity with the Brahman.\n\n[154:2](sbe0823.htm#fr_638) I. e. in various forms of life, Nilaka _nth_ a.\n\n[154:3](sbe0823.htm#fr_639) The going about in search of enjoyments.\n\n[154:4](sbe0823.htm#fr_640) The contact leads to pondering on them, and that\nto desire, &c., as described further on.\n\n[154:5](sbe0823.htm#fr_641) Through various lives. Birth and death are certain\nfor him.\n\n[154:6](sbe0823.htm#fr_642) I. e. causes oblivion of his real nature, _S_ a\n_n_ kara. Cf. the whole train of cause and effect at Gita, [p.\n50](sbe0804.htm#page_50) supra.\n\n[154:7](sbe0823.htm#fr_643) I. e. the pondering, desire, wrath, &c. As to I\nchildren,\' cf. Ka _th_ a, pp. 96 and 123, where bala is contrasted with dhira,\nas here. The \'good sense\' is of help in withstanding the temptations of\nworldly objects.\n\n[154:8](sbe0823.htm#fr_644) Destroys = abandons; pondering, just before this,\nis rendered by _S_ a _n_ kara to mean \'thinking of the objects as transient,\nimpure,\' &c.\n\n[154:9](sbe0823.htm#fr_645) _S_ a _n_ kara cites on this a stanza of unknown\nauthorship, which says, \'The learned and clever man who knows the self, and by\ndiscrimination destroys all objects of sense, is said to be the death of\ndeath.\' See too [p. 178](sbe0825.htm#page_178) infra.\n\n[155:1](sbe0823.htm#fr_646) On this Nilaka _nth_ a quotes these lines, \'The\nantelope, elephant, butterfly, bee, and fish--these five are destroyed by the\nfive,\' i. e. the five objects of sense, sound, &c. See _S_ anti Parvan (Moksha\nDharma), chap. 174, st. 45.\n\n[155:2](sbe0823.htm#fr_647) I. e. misery, Nilaka _nth_ a; merit or sin, _S_ a\n_n_ kara.\n\n[155:3](sbe0823.htm#fr_648) I. e. void of discrimination between the real and\nunreal, Nilaka _nth_ a; result of ignorance, _S_ a _n_ kara. \'A hell, as being\nfull of filth,\' says _S_ a _n_ kara, \'such as, phlegm, blood, excretions.\' Cf.\nMaitri, p. 48.\n\n[155:4](sbe0823.htm#fr_649) As blind men groping about fall into a ditch, so\ndo these, _S_ a _n_ kara.\n\n[155:5](sbe0823.htm#fr_650) I. e. other than the sensuous objects he loves;\n\'learns nothing\' about the supreme Self which he disregards.\n\n[155:6](sbe0823.htm#fr_651) Useless for any good purpose.\n\n[155:7](sbe0823.htm#fr_652) Cf. Taittiriya-upanishad, p. 102.\n\n[155:8](sbe0823.htm#fr_653) As being ruinous to oneself. _S_ a _n_ kara\ncompares Gita, [p. 68](sbe0808.htm#page_68). Cf. also Taittiriya-upanishad, p.\n103, and see B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p. 61.\n\n[155:9](sbe0823.htm#fr_654) I. e. heedlessness and its developments as stated.\n\n[155:10](sbe0823.htm#fr_655) _S_ a _n_ kara cites on this Taittiriya-\nupanishad, p. 78\n\n[155:11](sbe0823.htm#fr_656) Such as Satyaloka, &c.\n\n[156:1](sbe0823.htm#fr_657) _G_ yotish _t_ oma, A _s_ vamedha, and other\nrites.\n\n[156:2](sbe0823.htm#fr_658) As leading to final emancipation.\n\n[156:3](sbe0823.htm#fr_659) I. e. objects for which various ceremonies (or\n\'actions\') should be performed.\n\n[156:4](sbe0823.htm#fr_660) I. e. the man of knowledge.\n\n[156:5](sbe0823.htm#fr_661) I. e. into the sphere of action. Cf. Gita, [p.\n48](sbe0804.htm#page_48).\n\n[156:6](sbe0823.htm#fr_662) Knowing the supreme self is identical with\nbecoming the supreme self, Mu _nd_ aka, p. 323.\n\n[156:7](sbe0823.htm#fr_663) I. e. getting rid of the paths which keep one away\nfrom the Brahman by means of contemplation of the Brahman, &c. Nilaka _nth_ a\nrenders \'right path\' to mean the Sushum _n_ a passage by which the soul\nproceeds to final emancipation, see _Kh_ andogya, p. 570; Ka _th_ a, p. 157.\n\n[156:8](sbe0823.htm#fr_664) _S_ a _n_ kara says: \'Having shown that true death\nis heedlessness, and having shown that heedlessness in its forms of anger &c.\nis the cause of all evil, and having also shown that death is destroyed by\ntrue knowledge, and having shown further that heaven &c. are really not man\'s\nhighest goal; the author has also implied the unity of the supreme and\nindividual self. On that arises a doubt, which is stated in this passage.\'\n\n[156:9](sbe0823.htm#fr_665) All this = all the developments of the Brahman, i.\ne. space, wind, fire, water, earth, vegetation, food, living creatures; see\nTaittiriyopanishad, p. 68.\n\n[157:1](sbe0823.htm#fr_666) What is the purpose of its existence, and what\nmisery does it undergo on entering the course of worldly life?\n\n[157:2](sbe0823.htm#fr_667) \'The danger,\' says _S_ a _n_ kara, \'is that of\ncontravening Vedic texts such as "I am the Brahman," "Thou art that," &c.\' May\nit not rather be that pointed out at Ka _th_ opanishad, p. 129, viz. never\nattaining final emancipation? Cf. also N _ri_ si _m_ ha Tapini, p. 223.\n\n[157:3](sbe0823.htm#fr_668) The individual selfs, _S_ a _n_ kara.\n\n[157:4](sbe0823.htm#fr_671) Nature or maya.\n\n[157:5](sbe0823.htm#fr_670) The appearance of degradation to an inferior state\nbeing delusive.\n\n[157:6](sbe0823.htm#fr_672) The original word implies the possession of ai _s_\nvarya, dharma, ya _s_ as, _s_ ri, vairagya, moksha. See _S_ veta _s_ vatara,\np. 329 (where the list is slightly different). For another definition, see\nMaitri, p. 6 (gloss).\n\n[157:7](sbe0823.htm#fr_673) See note , p. 156.\n\n[157:8](sbe0823.htm#fr_674) _S_ a _n_ kara says: \'The question of Dh _ri_\ntarash _t_ ra having suggested a difference between two principles, one of\nwhich constrains, and the other of which is constrained, the answer is--Such a\ndifference ought not to be alleged, as it involves "danger." Then the question\narises, How is the difference, which does appear to be explained? The reply\nis, It is due to the beginningless principle--delusion or ignorance. The next\nsentence shows that the universe as it appears is also a result of delusion.\'\nNilaka _nth_ a says expressly, changes = delusion. He renders the original\nwhich we have translated by \'beginningless\' first, to mean \'collection of\nobjects of enjoyments.\' _S_ a _n_ kara\'s explanation seems tautological as\nregards the words \'connexion with the beginningless,\' which occur twice in the\nabove. Nilaka _nth_ a\'s p. 158 is not quite clear. May the expression on the\nsecond occasion mean, that the connexion by which beings are stated before to\nexist has had no beginning--has existed from eternity? The translation should\nthen run thus: \'And beings exist by a connexion which had no beginning;\' (see\nSariraka Bhashya, p. 494.) Connexions of things = creation of universe by his\npower.\n\n[158:1](sbe0823.htm#fr_675) E. g. Agnish _t_ oma, &c., _S_ a _n_ kara.\n\n[158:2](sbe0823.htm#fr_676) I. e. impiety or piety, sin or merit.\n\n[158:3](sbe0823.htm#fr_679) In _S_ rutis and Sm _ri_ tis, which _S_ a _n_ kara\nquotes. _Kh_ andogya, p. 622; Mu _nd_ aka, p. 309; B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p.\n911. See, too, Maitri, p. 131.\n\n[158:4](sbe0823.htm#fr_678) Of the man devoid of knowledge.\n\n[158:5](sbe0823.htm#fr_680) Cf. Gita, [p. 76](sbe0809.htm#page_76), and B _ri_\nhadara _n_ yaka, p. 636.\n\n[158:6](sbe0823.htm#fr_681) See [p. 164](sbe0824.htm#page_164), note\n[9](sbe0824.htm#fn_726) infra.\n\n[158:7](sbe0823.htm#fr_682) The feeling of one\'s own superiority over others\nin piety.\n\n[158:8](sbe0823.htm#fr_683) In the shape of Nakshatras,\' says _S_ a _n_ kara,\nwhich is not quite intelligible. See _Kh_ andogya, p. 258, and Anugita infra,\n[p. 240](sbe0829.htm#page_240).\n\n[159:1](sbe0823.htm#fr_684) According to the Vedantic theory, the acts of\npiety purify the inner man, and are thus a stepping-stone to knowledge. See\nIntroduction, [p. 147](sbe0821.htm#page_147) supra. Cf. Gita, [p.\n122](sbe0820.htm#page_122); and B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p. 899.\n\n[159:2](sbe0823.htm#fr_685) I. e. physical, mental, and such as is caused by\nsuperhuman agency. This is _S_ a _n_ kara\'s explanation. It is somewhat far\nfetched, but I can find none better. Cf. Gita, [p. 49](sbe0804.htm#page_49).\nAnd see also B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p. 876, and the commentary of _S_ a _n_\nkara there with \xc3\x82nandagiri\'s gloss.\n\n[159:3](sbe0823.htm#fr_686) E. g. wife, children, &c.\n\n[159:4](sbe0823.htm#fr_687) I. e. vexed as to how his livelihood is to be\nearned, &c.\n\n[159:5](sbe0823.htm#fr_688) Excess, e.g. too much obsequiousness towards a\n\'taciturn man,\' owing to his holiness, &c. Taciturn man = ascetic. Injury =\ndisrespect, &c. Perhaps the protest against worldliness is here carried to an\nextreme. _S_ a _n_ kara cites Manu as a parallel, \'A Brahma _n_ a should be\nafraid of (worldly) respect as of poison.\'\n\n[159:6](sbe0823.htm#fr_689) E.g. the Ku _s_ a grass, deerskin, &c., mentioned\nat Gita, [p. 68](sbe0808.htm#page_68).\n\n[159:7](sbe0823.htm#fr_690) I. e. he should not parade his actions. _S_ a _n_\nkara compares Vasish _th_ a and a Vedic text. See, too, the quotation at\nTaitt. \xc3\x82ra _n_. p. 902.\n\n[160:1](sbe0823.htm#fr_691) Cf. Gita, [p. 103](sbe0815.htm#page_103). _S_ a\n_n_ kara suggests an alternative explanation of this stanza, which will make\nit mean that one performing the operations of the senses, should devote\noneself nevertheless to the unknown principle, and not consider the senses to\nbe the self.\n\n[160:2](sbe0823.htm#fr_692) I. e. beyond the reach of inference; \'subtle,\'\nsays _S_ a _n_ kara. Cf. _S_ veta _s_ vatara, p. 364; B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka,\np. 855; Maitri, p. 182; and Ka _th_ a, p. 149, where _S_ a _n_ kara suggests a\nsomewhat different meaning. As to immovable, cf. \xc3\x8e _s_ a, p. 10, and Gita, [p.\n104](sbe0815.htm#page_104). _S_ a _n_ kara renders it by \'void of activity;\'\nand pure he paraphrases by \'free from ignorance and other taints.\'\n\n[160:3](sbe0823.htm#fr_693) It is difficult to say what \'in this way\' refers\nto. _S_ a _n_ kara renders it by \'as possessing qualities appertaining to the\ntwo kinds of body.\' On _S_ a _n_ kara\'s suggested meaning of the stanza\npreceding (see note  1), it would refer to the confusion of the senses with\nthe self.\n\n[160:4](sbe0823.htm#fr_694) Such a person is called a destroyer of his own\nself at \xc3\x8e _s_ opanishad, p. 9.\n\n[160:5](sbe0823.htm#fr_695) I. e. by the troubles of worldly life.\n\n[160:6](sbe0823.htm#fr_696) Cf. \'without belongings\' at Gita, [p.\n128](sbe0820.htm#page_128).\n\n[160:7](sbe0823.htm#fr_697) Anger and other obstacles to concentration of\nmind.\n\n[160:8](sbe0823.htm#fr_698) I. e. unintelligent. The text of Vasish _th_ a\nreferred to in note  7, p. 159, says he should act like an unintelligent man.\nCf. also Gau _d_ apada-karikas, p. 443, and _S_ ariraka Bhashya, p. 1041.\n\n[160:9](sbe0823.htm#fr_699) I. e. singing the praises of their own greatness\nand worth, instead of keeping their \'conduct unknown.\'\n\n[161:1](sbe0823.htm#fr_700) Highly esteemed for or strongly attached to, _S_ a\n_n_ kara. Human wealth = wife, offspring, property, &c. Cf. _Kh_ andogya, p.\n319; B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p. 262.\n\n[161:2](sbe0823.htm#fr_701) I. e. veracity and other duties taught by the\nVedas.\n\n[161:3](sbe0823.htm#fr_702) \'They need fear nought,\' says Nilaka _nth_ a.\n\n[161:4](sbe0823.htm#fr_703) I. e. may sacrifice to them, _S_ a _n_ kara.\n\n[161:5](sbe0823.htm#fr_704) Not even the deity to whom the sacrifice is\noffered is equal to one who knows the Brahman. Cf. Taittiriya, p. 23, and.\nAnugita, [p. 250](sbe0831.htm#page_250).\n\n[161:6](sbe0823.htm#fr_705) I. e. one who is \'taciturn\' and does not parade\nhis greatness.\n\n[161:7](sbe0823.htm#fr_706) He does not care for the respect shown him.\n\n[161:8](sbe0823.htm#fr_707) Because he knows the Brahman.\n\n[161:9](sbe0823.htm#fr_708) I. e. restraint of all senses, not of speech only.\nFor the contrast compare that between _s_ reya and preya at Ka _th_ a, p. 92.\n\n[161:10](sbe0823.htm#fr_709) I. e. by all men of understanding. _S_ a _n_\nkara\'s rendering is different: \'The next, which is known as Tad, is for\ntaciturnity.\' He cites for this Gita, [p. 120](sbe0819.htm#page_120).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter III](sbe0824.htm)\n\n'
