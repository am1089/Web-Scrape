And on account of its being unproved in every way.\n\nHere now come forward the Madhyamikas who teach that there is nothing but a\nuniversal Void. This theory of a universal Nothing is the real purport of\nSugata's doctrine; the theories of the momentariness of all existence, &c.,\nwhich imply the acknowledgment of the reality of things, were set forth by him\nmerely as suiting the limited intellectual capacities of his pupils.--Neither\ncognitions nor external objects have real existence; the Void (the ' _Nothing_\n') only constitutes Reality, and final Release means passing over into Non-\nbeing.\n\np. 515\n\n[paragraph continues] This is the real view of Buddha, and its truth is proved\nby the following considerations. As the Nothing is not to be proved by any\nargument, it is self-proved. For a cause has to be assigned for that only\nwhich _is_. But what _is_ does not originate either from that which is or that\nwhich is not. We never observe that which is to originate from Being; for\nthings such as jars, and so on, do not originate as long as the lump of clay,\n&c., is non-destroyed. Nor can Being originate from Non-being; for if the jar\nwere supposed to originate from Non-being, i.e. that non-being which results\nfrom the destruction of the lump of clay, it would itself be of the nature of\nNon-being. Similarly it can be shown that nothing can originate either from\nitself or from anything else. For the former hypothesis would imply the\nvicious procedure of the explanation presupposing the thing to be explained;\nand moreover no motive can be assigned for a thing originating from itself.\nAnd on the hypothesis of things originating from other things, it would follow\nthat anything might originate from anything, for all things alike are _other_\nthings. And as thus there is no origination there is also no destruction.\nHence the _Nothing_ constitutes Reality: origination, destruction, Being, Non-\nbeing, and so on, are mere illusions (bhranti). Nor must it be said that as\neven an illusion cannot take place without a substrate we must assume\nsomething real to serve as a substrate; for in the same way as an illusion may\narise even when the defect, the abode of the defect, and the knowing subject\nare unreal, it also may arise even when the substrate of the illusion is\nunreal. Hence the _Nothing_ is the only reality.--To this the Sutra replies,\n'And on account of its being in everyway unproved'--the theory of general\nNothingness which you hold cannot stand. Do you hold that everything is being\nor non-being, or anything else? On none of these views the Nothingness\nmaintained by you can be established. For the terms _being_ and _non-being_\nand the ideas expressed l\xc2\xbby them are generally understood to refer to\nparticular states of actually _existing_ things only. If therefore you declare\n'everything is nothing,' your declaration is equivalent\n\np. 516\n\nto the declaration, 'everything is being,' for your statement also can only\nmean that everything that _exists_ is capable of abiding in a certain\ncondition (which you call 'Nothing'). The absolute Nothingness you have in\nmind cannot thus be established in any way. Moreover, he who tries to\nestablish the tenet of universal Nothingness can attempt this in so far only\nas,--through some means of knowledge, he has come to know Nothingness, and he\nmust therefore acknowledge the truth of that means. For if it were not true it\nwould follow that everything is real. The view of general Nothingness is thus\naltogether incapable of proof.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of\n'unprovedness in every way.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 31.
