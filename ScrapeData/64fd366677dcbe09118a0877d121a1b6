Charm against takman (fever).\n\n1\\. As if from this Agni (fire), that burns and flashes, (the takman) comes.\nLet him then, too, as a babbling drunkard, pass away! Let him, the impious\none, search out some other person, not ourselves! Reverence be to the takman\nwith the burning weapon!  \n2\\. Reverence be to Rudra, reverence to the takman, reverence to the luminous\nking Varuna! Reverence to heaven, reverence to earth, reverence to the plants!  \n3\\. To thee here, that burnest through, and turnest all bodies yellow, to the\nred, to the brown, to the takman produced by the forest, do I render\nobeisance.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 25.
