See especially Pischel and\nGeldner, _Vedische Studien,_ vol. i., p. 183 foll.\n\n[76:3](brk38.htm#fr_38) This dialogue between Udd\xc4\x81laka and Y\xc4\x81jnavalkya formsp.\n77 part of a disputation between Brahman theologians, as the prize of which a\nthousand cows were offered by King Janaka of Videha (B\xe1\xb9\x9bihad-\xc4\x81r. Up. III. i.\n1). The mention of a splitting head occurs several times in a similar\nconnection in the Upanishads; practically it means that he who accepts the\nchallenge and fails in these tourneys of wit is doomed to death by "visitation\nof God."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI: The Wisdom of Raikva](brk39.htm)\n\n'
