Supposing that the original poets had\nrestricted themselves to the dijambus, who could have put in the place of that\nregular dijambus an irregular dipodia? Certainly not the authors of the Prati\n_s_ akhya, for their ears had clearly discovered the general rhythm of the\nancient metres; nor their predecessors, for they had in many instances\npreserved the tradition of syllables lengthened in accordance with the\nrequirements of the metre. I do not mean to insist too strongly on this\nargument, or to represent those who handed down the tradition of the Veda as\nendowed with anything like apaurusheyatva. Strange accidents have happened in\nthe text of the Veda, but they have generally happened when the sense of the\nhymns had ceased to be understood; and if anything helped to preserve the Veda\nfrom greater accidents, it was due, I believe, to the very fact that the metre\ncontinued to be understood, and that oral tradition, however much it might\nfail in other respects, had at all events to satisfy the ears of the hearers.\nI should\n\np. ci\n\nhave been much less surprised if all irregularities in the metre had been\nsmoothed down by the flux and reflux of oral tradition, a fact which is so\napparent in the text of Homer, where the gaps occasioned by the loss of the\ndigamma, were made good by the insertion of unmeaning particles; but I find it\ndifficult to imagine by what class of men, who must have lived between the\noriginal poets and the age of the Prati _s_ akhyas, the simple rhythm of the\nVedic metres should have been disregarded, and the sense of rhythm, which\nancient people possess in a far higher degree than we ourselves, been violated\nthrough crude and purposeless alterations. I shall give a few specimens only.\nWhat but a regard for real antiquity could have induced people in VIII, 2, 8,\nto preserve the defective foot of a Gayatri verse, sa\xcc\x86ma\xcc\x84ne\xcc\x84 a\xcc\x86dhi\xcc\x86 bha\xcc\x84rma\xcc\x84n?\nAny one acquainted with Sanskrit would naturally read sa\xcc\x86ma\xcc\x84ne\xcc\x84 a\xcc\x86dhi\xcc\x86\nbha\xcc\x84rma\xcc\x86 _n_ i\xcc\x84. But who would have changed bharma _n_ i, if that had been\nthere originally, to bharman? I believe we must scan sa\xcc\x86ma\xcc\x84ne\xcc\x84 a\xcc\x86dhi\xcc\x86\nbh\xcc\x86a\xcc\x84rma\xcc\x84n, or sa\xcc\x86m\xcc\x84a\xcc\x86ne\xcc\x84 a\xcc\x86dhi\xcc\x86 bha\xcc\x84rma\xcc\x84n, the paeon tertius being a\nperfectly legitimate foot at the end of a Gayatri verse. In X, 158, 1, we can\nunderstand how an accident happened. The original poet may have said: S\xcc\x86u\xcc\x84ryo\xcc\x84\nno\xcc\x84 di\xcc\x86va\xcc\x84s pa\xcc\x84tu\xcc\x86 pa\xcc\x84tu\xcc\x86 va\xcc\x84to\xcc\x84 a\xcc\x84nta\xcc\x86ri\xcc\x84\xcc\x86ksha\xcc\x84t, a\xcc\x84gni\xcc\x84r na\xcc\x84 _h_\npa\xcc\x84rthi\xcc\x86ve\xcc\x84bhy\xcc\x86a\xcc\x84 _h_. Here one of the two patu was lost. But if in the same\nhymn we find in the second verse two feet of nine instead of eight syllables\neach, I should not venture to alter this except in pronunciation, because no\nreason can be imagined why any one should have put these irregular lines in\nthe place of regular ones.\n\nIn V, 41, 10, g _ri \xcc\x86_ _n_ i\xcc\x84te\xcc\x84 a\xcc\x84gni\xcc\x86r e\xcc\x84ta\xcc\x86ri\xcc\x84 na\xcc\x86 _s_ u\xcc\x84sha\xcc\x84i _h_ , _s_ o\xcc\x84\n_k_ i\xcc\x84shke\xcc\x84 _s_ o\xcc\x84 ni\xcc\x86 ri\xcc\x86 _n_ a\xcc\x84ti\xcc\x86 va\xcc\x86na\xcc\x84, every modern Pandit would\nnaturally read vanani instead of vana, in order to get the regular Trish _t_\nubh metre. But this being the case, how can we imagine that even the most\nignorant member of an ancient Parishad should wilfully have altered vanani\ninto vana? What surprises one is, that vana should have been spared, in spite\nof every temptation to change it into vanani: for I cannot doubt for one\nmoment that vana is the right reading, only\n\np. cii\n\nthat the ancient poets pronounced it va\xcc\x86n\xcc\x84a\xcc\x86. Wherever we alter the text of\nthe Rig-veda by conjecture, we ought to be able, if possible, to give some\nexplanation how the mistake which we wish to remove came to be committed. If a\npassage is obscure, difficult to construe, if it contains words which occur in\nno other place, then we can understand how, during a long process of oral\ntradition, accidents may have happened. But when everything is smooth and\neasy, when the intention of the poet is not to be mistaken, when the same\nphrase has occurred many times before, then to suppose that a simple and\nperspicuous sentence was changed into a complicated and obscure string of\nwords, is more difficult to understand. I know there are passages where we\ncannot as yet account for the manner in which an evidently faulty reading\nfound its way into both the Pada and Sa _m_ hita texts, but in those very\npassages we cannot be too circumspect. If we read VIII, 40, 9, pu\xcc\x84rvi\xcc\x84sh _t_\na\xcc\x86 i\xcc\x84ndro\xcc\x84pa\xcc\x86ma\xcc\x84ta\xcc\x86ya\xcc\x84 _h_ pu\xcc\x84rvi\xcc\x84r u\xcc\x86ta\xcc\x86 pra\xcc\x86 _s_ a\xcc\x84sta\xcc\x86ya\xcc\x84 _h_ , nothing\nseems more tempting than to omit indra, and to read pu\xcc\x84rvi\xcc\x84sh _t_ a\xcc\x86\nu\xcc\x86pa\xcc\x86ma\xcc\x84ta\xcc\x86ya\xcc\x84 _h_. Nor would it be difficult to account for the insertion of\nindra; for though one would hardly venture to call it a marginal gloss that\ncrept into the text--a case which, as far as I can see, has never happened in\nthe hymns of the Rig-veda--it might be taken for an explanation given by an \xc3\x82\n_k_ arya to his pupils, in order to inform them that the ninth verse,\ndifferent from the eighth, was addressed to Indra. But however plausible this\nmay sound, the question remains whether the traditional reading could not be\nmaintained, by admitting synizesis of opa, and reading pu\xcc\x84rvi\xcc\x84sh _t_ a\xcc\x86\ni\xcc\x84ndro\xcd\xa1\xcc\x84pa\xcc\x86*ma\xcc\x84ta\xcc\x86ya\xcc\x84 _h_.

I must therefore give as much evidence as I can bring together in\nsupport of the contrary opinion; and though the process is a tedious one, the\nimportance of the consequences with regard to Vedic criticism leaves me no\nalternative. With regard, then, to Seven Gayatra V _ri_ ttas. the final\ndipodia of Gayatri verses, I still hold and maintain, that, although the\ndijambus is by far the most general metre, the following seven varieties have\nto be recognised in the poetry of the Veda a:\n\n1\\.  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84 , 2.  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84, 3.  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84, 4.  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84, 5.  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84\n\xcc\x84, 6.  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84, 7.  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84, 8.  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84.\n\nI do not pretend to give every passage in which these varieties occur, out I\nhope I shall give a sufficient number in support of every one of them.

Here Professor Kuhn and those who follow him\nmaintain that the rule is absolute, that the former must end in  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86, the\nlatter in  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84, and that the eighth syllable, immediately preceding\nthese syllables, ought, if possible, to be long. Nor can I deny that Professor\nKuhn has brought forward powerful arguments in support of his theory, and that\nhis emendations of the Vedic text recommend themselves by their great\ningenuity and simplicity. If his theory could be carried out, I should readily\nadmit that we should gain something. We should have throughout the Veda a\nperfectly uniform metre, and wherever we found any violation of it, we should\nbe justified in resorting to conjectural criticism.\n\nThe only question is at what price this strict uniformity can be obtained. If,\nfor instance, in order to have the regular v _ri_ ttas at the end of Traish\n_t_ ubha and _G_ agata lines, we were obliged to repeal all rules of prosody,\nto allow almost every short vowel to be used as long, and every long vowel to\nbe used as short, whether long by nature or by position, we should have gained\nvery little, we\n\np. cvii\n\nshould have robbed Peter to pay Paul, we should have removed no difficulty,\nbut only ignored the causes which created it. Now, if we examine the process\nby which Professor Kuhn establishes the regularity of the v _ri_ ttas or final\nsyllables of Traish _t_ ubha and _G_ agata padas, we find, in addition to the\nrules laid down before, and in which he is supported, as we saw, to a great\nextent by the Prati _s_ akhya and Pa _n_ ini, viz. the anceps nature of e and\no, and of a long final vowel before a vowel, the following exceptions or\nmetrical licences, without which that metrical uniformity at which he aims,\ncould not be obtained:\n\nProsodial Licences.1\\. The vowel o in the body of a word is to be treated as\noptionally short:\n\nII, 39, 3. pra\xcc\x86ti\xcc\x86 va\xcc\x84sto\xcc\x84\xcc\x86r u\xcc\x84sra\xcc\x84 (see Trish _t_. \xc2\xa7 5).\n\nHere the o of vasto _h_ is supposed to be short, although it is the Gu _n_ a\nof u, and therefore very different from the final e of sarve or aste, or the\nfinal o of sarvo for sarvas or mano for manas a. It should be remarked that in\nGreek, too, the final diphthongs corresponding to the e of sarve and aste are\ntreated as short, as far as the accent is concerned. Hence \xe1\xbc\x84\xcf\x80\xce\xbf\xce\xb9\xce\xba\xce\xbf\xce\xb9, \xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xbb\xcf\x80\xcf\x84\xce\xb5\xcf\x84\xce\xb1\xce\xb9,\nand even \xce\xb3\xce\xbd\xe1\xbf\xb6\xce\xbc\xce\xb1\xce\xb9, nom. plur. In Latin, too, the old terminations of the nom.\nsing. o and u, instead of the later us, are short. (Neue, Formenlehre, \xc2\xa7 23\nseq.)\n\nVI, 51, 15. go\xcc\x84\xcc\x86pa\xcc\x84 a\xcc\x86ma\xcc\x84.\n\nHere the o of gopa is treated as short, in order to get  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84 instead of\n\xcc\x84  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84, which is perfectly legitimate at the end of an Ush _n_ ih.\n\n2\\. The long i and u are treated as short, not only before vowels, which is\nlegitimate, but also before consonants.\n\nVII, 62, 4. dya\xcc\x84va\xcc\x84bhu\xcc\x84mi\xcc\x84 a\xcc\x86di\xcc\x86te\xcc\x84 tra\xcc\x84s\xcc\x8di\xcc\x84\xcc\x86tha\xcc\x84 _m_ na\xcc\x84 _h_ (see Trish _t_.\n\xc2\xa7 5).\n\nThe forms i\xcc\x84 _s_ i\xcc\x84ya\xcc\x84 and ra\xcc\x84si\xcc\x84ya\xcc\x84 in VII, 32, 18, occur at the end of\noctosyllabic or Gayatra padas, and are therefore\n\np. cviii\n\nperfectly legitimate, yet Professor Kuhn would change them too, into i\xcc\x84 _s_\ni\xcc\x86ya\xcc\x84 and ra\xcc\x84si\xcc\x86ya\xcc\x84. In VII, 28, 4, even mayi is treated as ma\xcc\x84yi\xcc\x86 (see Trish\n_t_. \xc2\xa7 5); and in VII, 68, 1, vi\xcc\x84ta\xcc\x84m as vi\xcc\x86ta\xcc\x84m. If, in explanation of this\nshortening of vitam, vihi is quoted, which is identified with vi\xcc\x86hi, this can\nhardly be considered as an argument, for vi\xcc\x86hi\xcc\x86 occurs where no short syllable\nis required, IV, 48, 1; II, 26, 2; and where, therefore, the shortening of the\nvowel cannot be attributed to metrical reasons.\n\n3\\. Final m followed by an initial consonant is allowed to make no position,\nand even in the middle of a word a nasal followed by a liquid is supposed to\nmake positio debilis. Several of the instances, however, given in support, are\nfrom Gayatra padas, where Professor Kuhn, in some of his later articles, has\nhimself allowed greater latitude; others admit of different scanning, as for\ninstance,\n\nI, 117, 8. ma\xcc\x86ha\xcc\x84 _h_ ksho\xcc\x84 _n_ a\xcc\x84sya\xcc\x86 a\xcc\x84 _s_ vi\xcc\x86na\xcc\x84 ka\xcc\x84 _n_ va\xcc\x84ya\xcc\x84.\n\nHere, even if we considered the dispondeus as illegitimate, we might scan ka\xcd\xa1\xcc\x86\n_n_ v\xcc\x86*a\xcc\x84ya\xcc\x86, for this scanning occurs in other places, while to treat the\nfirst a as short before _n_ v seems tantamount to surrendering all rules of\nprosody.\n\n4\\. Final n before semivowels, mutes, and double n before vowels make no\nposition a. Ex. III, 49, I. ya\xcc\x84smi\xcc\x84\xcc\x86n vi\xcc\x84 _s_ va\xcc\x84 (Trish _t_. \xc2\xa7 5);.

S before mutes makes no position. Ex. VI, 66, II. u\xcc\x84gra\xcc\x84 a\xcc\x84\xcc\x86sp _ri_ dhra\xcc\x84n\n(Trish _t_. \xc2\xa7 3).\n\n7\\. _S_ before _k_ makes no position. Ex. vi\xcc\x84 _s_ va\xcc\x84\xcc\x86 _s_ _k_ a\xcc\x84ndra\xcc\x84 _h_ ,\n&c.\n\n8\\. Mutes before s make no position. Ex. ra\xcc\x84\xcc\x86ksha\xcc\x84s, according to Professor\nKuhn, in the seventh Ma _n_ _d_ ala only, but see I, 12, 5; ku\xcc\x84\xcc\x86tsa, &c.\n\n9\\. Mutes before r or v make no position. Ex. su\xcc\x86 _s_ i\xcc\x84\xcc\x86pra\xcc\x84, di\xcc\x84rgha\xcc\x84\xcc\x86 _s_\nru\xcc\x84t.\n\n10\\. Sibilants before y make no position. Ex. da\xcc\x84\xcc\x86syu\xcc\x84n.\n\n11\\. R followed by mutes or sibilants makes no position. Ex. a\xcc\x84yu\xcc\x84\xcc\x86r _g_\ni\xcc\x84va\xcc\x86se\xcc\x84, _kh_ a\xcc\x84\xcc\x86rdi\xcc\x84 _h_ , va\xcc\x84\xcc\x86rshi\xcc\x84sh _th_ a\xcc\x84m.\n\n12\\. Words like sma\xcc\x84\xcc\x86ddi\xcc\x84sh _t_ i\xcc\x84n, &c. retain their vowel short before two\nfollowing consonants.\n\nWe now proceed to consider a number of prosodial rules which Professor Kuhn\nproposes to repeal in order to have a long syllable where the MSS. supply a\nshort:\n\n1\\. The vowel _ri_ is to be pronounced as long, or rather as ar. Ex. I, 12, 9.\nta\xcc\x84sma\xcc\x84i pa\xcc\x84va\xcc\x86ka\xcc\x86 m _ri \xcc\x86_ _l_ a\xcc\x86ya\xcc\x84 is to be read ma\xcc\x84rda\xcc\x86ya\xcc\x84; V, 33, 10. sa\xcc\x84\n_m_ va\xcc\x86ra\xcc\x86 _n_ a\xcc\x84sya\xcc\x86 _ri \xcc\x86_she\xcc\x84 _h_ is to be read arshe _h_. But why not\nsa\xcc\x84mva\xcc\x86ra\xcc\x86 _n_ a\xcc\x84sy\xcd\xa1 \xcc\x84 _ri_ *she\xcc\x84 _h_ (i. e. siarshe _h_ )?\n\n2\\. The a privativum may be lengthened. Ex. a\xcc\x85\xcc\x86 _g_ a\xcc\x86ra\xcc\x84h, a\xcc\x85\xcc\x86m _ri \xcc\x86_ta\xcc\x84\n_h_.\n\n3\\. Short vowels before liquids may be long. Ex. na\xcc\x85\xcc\x86ra _h_ , ta\xcc\x85\xcc\x86ruta,\nta\xcc\x85\xcc\x86rati, ma\xcc\x85\xcc\x86rutam, ha\xcc\x85\xcc\x86riva _h_ , a\xcc\x85\xcc\x86rushi, dadhu\xcc\x85\xcc\x86r iha, su\xcc\x85\xcc\x86vita (p. 471).\n\n4\\. Short vowels before nasals may be lengthened. Ex. _g_ a\xcc\x85\xcc\x86nan, sa\xcc\x85\xcc\x86nitar,\nta\xcc\x85\xcc\x86nu _h_ , u\xcc\x86pa\xcc\x85\xcc\x86 na\xcc\x84 _h_.\n\n5\\. Short vowels before the ma of the superlative may be lengthened. Ex. n\n_ri_ ta\xcc\x85\xcc\x86ma.\n\n6\\. The short a in the roots _s_ am and yam, and in am (the termination of the\naccusative) may be lengthened.\n\np. cx\n\n7\\. The group a\xcc\x86va\xcc\x86 is to be pronounced au\xcc\x84a\xcc\x86. Ex. a\xcc\x86va\xcc\x86se\xcc\x84 becomes au\xcc\x84a\xcc\x86se\xcc\x84;\nsa\xcc\x86vi\xcc\x86ta\xcc\x84 becomes sau\xcc\x84i\xcc\x86ta\xcc\x84; na\xcc\x86va\xcc\x86 becomes nau\xcc\x84a\xcc\x86.\n\n8\\. The group a\xcc\x86ya\xcc\x86 is to be changed into ai\xcc\x84a\xcc\x86 or e\xcc\x84a\xcc\x86. Ex. na\xcc\x86ya\xcc\x86si\xcc\x86 becomes\nnai\xcc\x84a\xcc\x86si\xcc\x86.\n\n9\\. The group va\xcc\x86 is to be changed into ua, and this ua to be treated as a\nkind of diphthong and therefore long. Ex. ka\xcc\x84 _n_ va\xcc\x86ta\xcc\x86ma\xcc\x84 _h_ becomes ka\xcc\x84\xcc\x86\n_n_ u\xcd\xa1a\xcc\x85*ta\xcc\x86ma\xcc\x84 _h_ ; va\xcc\x86ru\xcc\x86 _n_ a\xcc\x84 _h_ becomes u\xcd\xa1a\xcc\x85*ru\xcc\x86 _n_ a\xcc\x84 _h_.\n\n10\\. The short vowel in the reduplicated syllable of perfects is to be\nlengthened. Ex. ta\xcc\x85\xcc\x86ta\xcc\x86na\xcc\x84 _h_ , da\xcc\x85\xcc\x86dhi\xcc\x86re\xcc\x84.\n\n11\\. Short vowels before all aspirates may be lengthened. Ex. ra\xcc\x86tha _h_\nbecomes ra\xcc\x84tha _h_ ; sa\xcc\x86kha becomes sa\xcc\x84kha.\n\n12\\. Short vowels before h and all sibilants may be lengthened. Ex. ma\xcc\x86hi\xcc\x86ni\xcc\x86\nbecomes ma\xcc\x84hi\xcc\x86ni\xcc\x86; u\xcc\x86 _s_ i\xcc\x86 _g_ am becomes u\xcc\x84 _s_ i\xcc\x86 _g_ am; ri\xcc\x86sha\xcc\x86te\xcc\x84\nbecomes ri\xcc\x84sha\xcc\x86te\xcc\x84; da\xcc\x86sa\xcc\x84t becomes da\xcc\x84sa\xcc\x84t.\n\n13\\. The short vowel before t may be lengthened. Ex. va _g_ ava\xcc\x86ta _h_ becomes\nva _g_ ava\xcc\x84ta _h_ ; a\xcc\x86tithi _h_ becomes a\xcc\x84tithi _h_.\n\n14\\. The short vowel before d may be lengthened. Ex. u\xcc\x86daram becomes u\xcc\x84daram;\nu\xcc\x86d ava becomes u\xcc\x84d ava.\n\n15\\. The short vowel before p may be lengthened. Ex. a\xcc\x86pam becomes a\xcc\x84pam;\nta\xcc\x86pushim becomes ta\xcc\x84pushim ; g _ri_ ha\xcc\x86patim becomes g _ri_ ha\xcc\x84patim.\n\n16\\. The short vowel before g and _g_ may be lengthened. Ex. sanusha\xcc\x86g asat\nbecomes sanusha\xcc\x84g asat; yuna\xcc\x86 _g_ an becomes yuna\xcc\x84 _g_ an.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[civ:a](sbe3213.htm#fr_59) See some important remarks on these varieties in\nMr. J. Boxwell's article 'On the Trish _t_ ubh Metre,' Journal Asiat. Soc.\nBeng., 1885, p. 79.\n\n[cvii:a](sbe3213.htm#fr_60) A very strong divergence of opinion is expressed\non this point by Professor Bollensen. He says: 'O und E erst spater in die\nSchrifttafel aufgenommen, bewahren ihre Lange durch das ganze indische\nSchriftenthum bis ins Apabhra _m_ _s_ a hinab. Selbstverstandlich kann kurz o\nund e im Veda erst recht nicht zugelassen werden.' Zeitschrift der D. M. G.,\nvol. xxii, p. 574.\n\n[cviii:a](sbe3213.htm#fr_61) Professor Kuhn has afterwards (Beitrage, vol. iv,\np. 207) modified this view, and instead of allowing a final nasal vowel\nfollowed by a mute to make positio debilis, he thinks that the nasal should in\nmost cases be omitted altogether.\n\n[cviii:b](sbe3213.htm#fr_62) Here a distinction should be made, I think,\nbetween an n before a consonant, and a final n following a short vowel, which,\naccording to the rules of Sandhi, is doubled, if a vowel follows. In the\nlatter case, the vowel before the n remains, no doubt, short in many cases,\nor, more correctly, the doubling of the n does not take place, e. g. I, 63, 4;\n186, 4. In other places, the doubling seems preferable, e _g_. I, 33, 11,\nthough Professor Kuhn would remove it altogether.
