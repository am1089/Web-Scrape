Standing he puts on that (gold plate) 1,--for that gold plate is\nyonder sun, and yonder sun stands, as it were; and moreover, while standing\none is stronger. [He does so] standing with his face towards north-east: the\nsignificance of this has been explained.\n\n6:7:2:22\\. [Va _g_. S. XII, 1; _Ri_ k S. X, 45, 8] 'Looking like 2 a golden\ndisk he hath shone far and wide,'--for that gold plate, being seen, indeed\nshines far and wide;--'flashing forth unquenchable 3 life for glory,'--for not\neasily dying is his (Agni's) life (vital power); and for glory he does\nshine;--'Agni became immortal by his powers, when Dyaus bore him--,' for Dyaus\n(the sky) did bear him;--'she that hath good seed--,' for good seed indeed she\nhas whose seed he (Agni) is.\n\n6:7:2:33\\. He then takes hold of him by means of the two pads, with (Va _g_.\nS. XII, 2 4), 'Night and Dawn,\n\np. 273\n\nof one mind, unlike in form,'--night and dawn, doubtless, are day and night,\n(and they are) of one mind 1, and unlike in form;--'nourish one child,\ncombining together,'--whatever belongs to the day and the night, therewith\nthey, combining together, indeed nourish him (Agni);--'a golden disk, he\nshineth between heaven and earth,'--whilst taking it (the fire), he mutters\nthis prayer; for heaven and earth are those two, the sky and the earth; and\nmoving between these two he shines: that is why, in taking it, he mutters this\nprayer;--'the wealth-giving gods kept Agni;'--therewith, having taken hold of\nit in both hands, he sets it down; for the wealth-giving gods are the vital\nairs, and they indeed kept up Agni at first: by means of them he now keeps him\nup.\n\n6:7:2:44\\. He then puts round his (neck) the sling of the netting, with (Va\n_g_. S. XII, 3; _Ri_ k S. V, 81, 2), 'The wise putteth on all forms,'--the\nwise one, doubtless, is yonder sun, and the netting is all forms;--'he hath\nbrought forth what is good for the two-footed and four-footed,'--for in rising\nhe does bring forth what is good for the two-footed and four-footed;--'the\nadorable Savit _ri_ hath glanced over the firmament,'--the firmament,\ndoubtless, is the heaven, and even in rising he looks along it;--'he flasheth\nforth after the starting 2 of the Dawn,'--for the Dawn shines forth first, and\nafter her shining forth he (the sun) follows, flashing forth.\n\n6:7:2:55\\. By means of the fashioning (formula) he then fashions him out of\nthat (matter): he thereby\n\np. 274\n\nfashions that infused seed, whence the seed infused into the womb is\nfashioned.\n\n6:7:2:66\\. [Va _g_. S. XII, 4] 'A well-winged bird thou art!'--the well-winged\nbird means vigour: he thus forms him so as to be (endowed with) vigour;--'the\nTriv _ri_ t is thy head,'--he thus makes the Triv _ri_ t stoma (nine-versed\nhymn) his head;--'the Gayatra thine eye,'--he thus makes the Gayatri metre his\neye;--'the B _ri_ hat and Rathantara thy wings,'--he thus makes the B _ri_ hat\nand Rathantara (hymn-tunes) his wings;--'the hymn is the self,'--the Pa _\xc3\xb1_\n_k_ avi _m_ _s_ a stoma (twenty-five-versed hymn) he makes the self (soul, or\nbody);--'the metres the limbs,'--for the metres are indeed his (Agni's)\nlimbs;--'the prayers his name,'--the prayers (ya _g_ us) are his name 'Agni'\nby which they call him,--'the Vamadevya saman is thy body,'--the body,\ndoubtless, is the self: thus 'the Vamadevya (hymn-tune) is thy body, thy self;\n'the Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ aya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iya thy tail,'--he thus makes the Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ aya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iya 1 his tail;--'the hearths thy hoofs,'--by means of the hearths he\n(Agni) is indeed established in this world;--'thou art a well-winged bird: go\nto the heaven! fly to the light!'--thus having made him a well-winged 2, bird\nhe says, 'Go to the gods! fly to the heavenly world!\n\n6:7:2:77\\. He fashions him here (in the pan or womb) into (a bird) with wings\nand tail; for whatlike the seed is fashioned in the womb, suchlike it is born;\nand because he here fashions him as (a bird) with\n\np. 275\n\nwings and tail, therefore he is hereafter born with wings and tail.\n\n6:7:2:88\\. Now some, after addressing him by that fashioning (formula), build\na different altar (than of an eagle's shape), either one constructed in the\nform of a trough 1, or like a chariot-wheel, or like a kite, or like the front\npart of a thill, or like a thill on both sides, or one consisting of a heap of\nloose soil 2. Let him not do so, (but) in such wise as one might carve a young\none with wings and tail: let him therefore build it (the fire-altar) in the\nform of an eagle.\n\n6:7:2:99\\. With that fashioning (formula) he holds him high up from thence\ntowards east 3; for he, Agni, is yonder sun: he thus places yonder sun high up\nfrom here in the east; and hence yonder sun is placed high up from here in the\neast. He holds him up so as to be beyond the reach of the arms, for he (the\nsun) is beyond the reach of the arms from here. He then lowers him, and,\nhaving lowered him, he holds him above the navel: the significance of this has\nbeen explained 4.\n\n6:7:2:1010\\. He then strides the Vish _n_ u-strides 5. For the gods, in the\nform of Vish _n_ u (the sun), then strode through these worlds; and inasmuch\nas, in the form of Vish _n_ u, they thus strode, they are called the Vish _n_\nu-strides: in like manner does the Sacrificer,\n\np. 276\n\nin the form of Vish _n_ u, now stride through these worlds.\n\n6:7:2:1111\\. Now he who is Vish _n_ u is this sacrifice; and he who is this\nsacrifice is that same Agni in the ukha (fire-pan): into that same (Agni) the\ngods changed themselves, and strode through these worlds; and in like manner\nthe Sacrificer, having changed himself into that same (Agni), strides through\nthese worlds.\n\n6:7:2:1212\\. Standing with his face towards north-east (he strides); for\nstanding towards north-east Pra _g_ apati created offspring by means of the\nVish _n_ u-strides: in like manner does the Sacrificer now, standing towards\nnorth-east, create offspring by means of the Vish _n_ u-strides.\n\n6:7:2:1313\\. [Va _g_. S. XII, 5] 'Thou art Vish _n_ u's stride,'--for in the\nform of Vish _n_ u he strides; 'the slayer of foes;'--for he now slays his\nfoes;--'mount thou the Gayatri metre,'--the Gayatri metre he does\nmount,--'stride along the earth!'--along the earth he indeed strides. He\nstretches forward his (right) foot and strides: he raises the fire upwards,\nfor upwards he ascends.\n\n6:7:2:1414\\. 'Thou art Vish _n_ u's stride,'--for in the form of Vish _n_ u he\nstrides;--'the slayer of plotters,'--for he now does slay the\nplotters;--'mount thou the Trish _t_ ubh metre!'--the Trish _t_ ubh metre he\ndoes mount;--'stride along the air!'--along the air he indeed strides. He\nstretches forward his foot and strides: he raises the fire (yet further)\nupwards, for upwards he ascends.\n\n6:7:2:1515\\. 'Thou art Vish _n_ u's stride,'--for in the form of Vish _n_ u he\nstrides;--'the slayer of the evil-minded,'--for he now does slay the evil-\nminded;--\n\np. 277\n\n[paragraph continues] 'Mount the _G_ agati metre!'--for the _G_ agati metre he\ndoes mount;--'stride along the sky!'--along the sky he indeed strides. He\nstretches his foot forward and strides: he raises the fire (yet further)\nupwards, for upwards he ascends.\n\n6:7:2:1616\\. 'Thou art Vish _n_ u's stride,'--for in the form of Vish _n_ u he\nstrides;--'the slayer of the hostile,'--for he now does slay the\nhostile;--'mount thou the Anush _t_ ubh metre!'--the Anush _t_ ubh metre he\ndoes mount;--'stride along the quarters!'--he looks along the (four) quarters;\nhe does not stretch forward his foot, thinking, 'Lest I lose these worlds!'--\nHe raises the fire right up, for he ascends completely (to the top).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[272:1](sbe4150.htm#fr_517) The author now proceeds to give further\nparticulars regarding the ceremonial details treated of in the preceding\nchapter ([VI, 7, 1, 1](sbe4149.htm#6:7:1:1) seq.).\n\n[272:2](sbe4150.htm#fr_518) Literally, 'seen' or appearing (like).'\n\n[272:3](sbe4150.htm#fr_519) Rather 'irresistible, difficult to bear\n(against);' but the author connects 'durmarsha' with 'mar,' to die.\n\n[272:4](sbe4150.htm#fr_520) _Ri_ k S.
