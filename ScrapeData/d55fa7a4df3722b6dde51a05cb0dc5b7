But of the others, after having enjoyed the fruits of their actions in Sa\n_m_ yamana, ascent and descent take place; as such a course is declared (by\nscripture).\n\n'But' discards the purvapaksha. It is not true that all men go to the moon.\nFor the ascent to the moon is for the purpose of enjoyment only; it is neither\nwithout a special purpose nor for the mere purpose of subsequent re-descent.\nJust as a man climbs on a tree for the purpose of breaking fruit or blossoms,\nnot either without any aim or for the mere purpose of coming down again. Now\nit has been admitted already that for those who do not offer sacrifices there\nis not any enjoyment in the moon; hence those only who perform sacrifices rise\nto the moon, not any other persons. The latter descend to Sa _m_ yamana, the\nabode of Yama, suffer there the torments of Yama corresponding to their evil\ndeeds, and then again re-ascend to this world. Such is their ascent and\ndescent; as we maintain on the ground of such a course being declared by\nscripture. For a scriptural passage embodying Yama's own words declares that\nthose who die without having offered sacrifices fall into Yama's\n\np. 123\n\npower.' The other world never rises before the eyes of the careless child\ndeluded by the delusion of wealth. This is the world, he thinks, there is no\nother; thus he falls again and again under my sway' (Ka. Up. I, 2, 6).\nScripture contains many other passages likewise leading us to infer that men\nfall into Yama's power; cp. e.g. 'Yama, the gathering-place of men' ( _Ri_. Sa\n_m_ h. X, 14, 1).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 1, 14](sbe38090.htm)\n\n"
