XI.\n\nIndra, offended by the loss of his offerings, causes heavy rain to deluge\nGokula. Krishn\xcc\x81a holds up the mountain Govarddhana to shelter the cowherds and\ntheir cattle.\n\nINDRA, being thus disappointed of his offerings, was exceedingly angry, and\nthus addressed a cohort of his attendant clouds, called Samvarttaka: "Ho,\nclouds," he said, "hear my words, and without delay execute what I command.\nThe insensate cowherd Nanda, assisted by his fellows, has withheld the usual\nofferings to us, relying upon the protection of Krishn\xcc\x81a. Now, therefore,\nafflict the cattle, that are their sustenance, and whence their occupation is\nderived, with rain and wind. Mounted upon my elephant, as vast as a mountain\npeak, I will give you aid in strengthening the tempest." When Indra ceased,\nthe clouds, obedient to his commands, came down, in a fearful storm of rain\nand wind, to destroy the cattle. In an instant the earth, the points of the\nhorizon, and the sky, were all blended into one by the heavy and incessant\nshower. The clouds roared aloud, as if in terror of the lightning\'s scourge,\nand poured down uninterrupted torrents. The whole earth was enveloped in\nimpenetrable darkness by the thick and volumed clouds; and above, below, and\non every side, the world was water. The cattle, pelted by the storm, shrunk\ncowering into the smallest size, or gave up their breath: some covered their\ncalves with their flanks, and some beheld their young ones carried away by the\nflood. The calves, trembling in the wind, looked piteously at their mothers,\nor implored in low moans, as it were, the succour of Krishn\xcc\x81a. Hari, beholding\nall Gokula agitated with alarm, cowherds, cowherdesses, and cattle all in a\nstate of consternation, thus reflected: "This is the work of Mahendra, in\nresentment of the prevention of his sacrifice, and it is incumbent on me to\ndefend this station of herdsmen. I will lift up this spacious mountain from\nits stony base, and hold it up, as a large umbrella, over the cow-pens."\nHaving thus determined, Krishn\xcc\x81a immediately plucked up the mountain\nGovarddhana, and held it aloft with one hand in sport, saying to the herdsmen,\n"Lo the mountain\n\np. 527\n\nis on high; enter beneath it quickly, and it will shelter you from the storm:\nhere you will be secure and at your ease in places defended from the wind:\nenter without delay, and fear not that the mountain will fall." Upon this, all\nthe people, with their herds, and their waggons and goods, and the Gopis,\ndistressed by the rain, repaired to the shelter of the mountain, which\nKrishn\xcc\x81a held steadily over their heads; and Krishn\xcc\x81a, as he supported the\nmountain, was contemplated by the dwellers of Vraja with joy and wonder; and,\nas their eyes opened wide with astonishment and pleasure, the Gopas and Gopis\nsang his praise. For seven days and nights did the vast clouds sent by Indra\nrain upon the Gokula of Nanda to destroy its inhabitants, but they were\nprotected by the elevation of the mountain; and the slayer of Bala, Indra,\nbeing foiled in his purpose, commanded the clouds to cease. The threats of\nIndra having been fruitless, and the heavens clear, all Gokula came forth from\nits shelter, and returned to its own abode. Then Krishn\xcc\x81a, in the sight of the\nsurprised inhabitants of the forests, restored the great mountain Govarddhana\nto its original site 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[527:1](vp128.htm#fr_1490) It seems not unlikely that this legend has some\nreference to the caves or cavern temples in various parts of India. A\nremarkable representation of it occurs upon the sculptured rocks of\nMahabalipur. It is related much to the same purport in the Bhagavata, &c.\n\xc5\x9ai\xc5\x9bupala, ridiculing the exploit, asserts that Govarddhana was nothing more\nthan an ant hill.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XII](vp129.htm)\n\n'
