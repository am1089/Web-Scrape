And it is common up to the beginning of the way; and the immortality (is\nthat which is obtained), without having burned.\n\nIs this departure of the soul common to him who knows and him who does not\nknow?--It belongs to him only who does not know, the Purvapakshin holds. For\nScripture declares that for him who knows there is no departure, and that\nhence he becomes immortal then and there (irrespective of any departure of the\nsoul to another place), 'when all desires which once dwelt in his heart are\nundone, then the mortal becomes immortal, then he obtains Brahman' (B _ri_.\nUp. IV, 4, 7). This view the Sutra sets aside. For him also who knows there is\nthe same way of passing out up to the beginning of the path, i.e. previously\nto the soul's entering the veins. For another text expressly declares that the\nsoul of him also who knows passes out by way of a particular vein: 'there are\na hundred and one veins of the heart; one of them penetrates the crown of the\nhead; moving upwards by that a man reaches immortality, the others serve for\ndeparting in different directions' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 6, 5). Scripture thus\ndeclaring that the soul of him who knows passes out by way of a particular\nvein, it must of course be admitted that it _does_ pass out; and as up to the\nsoul's entering the vein no difference is mentioned, we must assume that up to\nthat moment the departure of him who knows does not differ from that\n\np. 732\n\nof him who does not know. A difference however is stated with regard to the\nstage of the soul's entering the vein, viz. B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 2, 'By that\nlight the Self departs, either through the eye, or through the skull, or\nthrough other parts of the body.' As this text must be interpreted in\nagreement with the text relative to the hundred and one veins, the departure\nby way of the head must be understood to belong to him who knows, while the\nother modes of departing belong to other persons. The last clause of the Sutra\n'and the immortality, without having burned' replies to what the Purvapakshin\nsaid as to the soul of him who knows being declared by Scripture to attain to\nimmortality then and there. The immortality referred to in the text 'when all\ndesires of his heart are undone' denotes that non-clinging and destruction of\nearlier and later sins which comes to him who knows, together with the rise of\nknowledge, without the connexion of the soul with the body, and the sense-\norgans being burned, i.e. dissolved at the time.--'He reaches Brahman' in the\nsame text means that in the act of devout meditation the devotee has an\nintuitive knowledge of Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 8.
