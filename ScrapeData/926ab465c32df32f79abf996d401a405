Now when Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya was going to enter upon another state, he\nsaid: 'Maitreyi 3, verily I am going away from this my house (into the forest\n4). Forsooth, let me make a settlement between thee and that Katyayani (my\nother wife).'\n\n2\\. Maitreyi said: 'My Lord, if this whole earth, full of wealth, belonged to\nme, tell me, should I be immortal by it 5?'\n\np. 109\n\n'No,' replied Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya; 'like the life of rich people will be thy\nlife. But there is no hope of immortality by wealth.'\n\n3\\. And Maitreyi said: 'What should I do with that by which I do not become\nimmortal? What my Lord knoweth (of immortality), tell that to me 1.'\n\n4\\. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya replied: 'Thou who art truly dear to me, thou speakest\ndear words 2. Come, sit down, I will explain it to thee, and mark well what I\nsay.'\n\n5\\. And he said: 'Verily, a husband is not dear, that you may love the\nhusband; but that you may love the Self, therefore a husband is dear.\n\n'Verily, a wife is not dear, that you may love the wife; but that you may love\nthe Self, therefore a wife is dear.\n\n'Verily, sons are not dear, that you may love the sons; but that you may love\nthe Self, therefore sons are dear.\n\n'Verily, wealth is not dear, that you may love wealth; but that you may love\nthe Self, therefore wealth is dear 3.\n\n'Verily, the Brahman-class is not dear, that you may love the Brahman-class;\nbut that you may love the Self, therefore the Brahman-class is dear.\n\n'Verily, the Kshatra-class is not dear, that you may love the Kshatra-class;\nbut that you may love the Self, therefore the Kshatra-class is dear.\n\n'Verily, the worlds are not dear, that you may love the worlds; but that you\nmay love the Self, therefore the worlds are dear.\n\np. 110\n\n'Verily, the Devas are not dear, that you may love the Devas; but that you may\nlove the Self, therefore the Devas are dear 1.\n\n'Verily, creatures are not dear, that you may love the creatures; but that you\nmay love the Self, therefore are creatures dear.\n\n'Verily, everything is not dear that you may love everything; but that you may\nlove the Self, therefore everything is dear.\n\n'Verily, the Self is to be seen, to be heard, to be perceived, to be marked, O\nMaitreyi! When we see, hear, perceive, and know the Self 2, then all this is\nknown.\n\n6\\. 'Whosoever looks for the Brahman-class elsewhere than in the Self, was 3\nabandoned by the Brahman-class. Whosoever looks for the Kshatra-class\nelsewhere than in the Self, was abandoned by the Kshatra-class. Whosoever\nlooks for the worlds elsewhere than in the Self, was abandoned by the worlds.\nWhosoever looks for the Devas elsewhere than in the Self, was abandoned by the\nDevas 4. Whosoever looks for creatures elsewhere than in the Self, was\nabandoned by the creatures. Whosoever looks for anything elsewhere than in the\nSelf, was abandoned by everything. This Brahman-class, this Kshatra-class,\nthese worlds, these Devas 5, these 6 creatures, this everything, all is that\nSelf.\n\n7\\. 'Now as 7 the sounds of a drum, when beaten,\n\np. 111\n\ncannot be seized externally (by themselves), but the sound is seized, when the\ndrum is seized or the beater of the drum;\n\n8., And as the sounds of a conch-shell, when blown, cannot be seized\nexternally (by themselves), but the sound is seized, when the shell is seized\nor the blower of the shell;\n\n9\\. 'And as the sounds of a lute, when played, cannot be seized externally (by\nthemselves), but the sound is seized, when the lute is seized or the player of\nthe lute;\n\n10\\. 'As clouds of smoke proceed by themselves out of a lighted fire kindled\nwith damp fuel, thus, verily, O Maitreyi, has been breathed forth from this\ngreat Being what we have as _Ri_ g-veda, Ya _g_ ur-veda, Sama-veda,\nAtharva\xe1\xb9\x85girasas, Itihasa (legends), Pura _n_ a (cosmogonies), Vidya\n(knowledge), the Upanishads, _S_ lokas (verses), Sutras (prose rules),\nAnuvyakhyanas (glosses), Vyakhyanas (commentaries) 1. From him alone all these\nwere breathed forth.\n\n11\\. 'As all waters find their centre in the sea, all touches in the skin, all\ntastes in the tongue, all smells in the nose, all colours in the eye, all\nsounds in the ear, all percepts in the mind, all knowledge in the heart, all\nactions in the hands, all movements in the feet, and all the Vedas in\nspeech,--\n\n12\\. 'As a lump of salt 2, when thrown into water, becomes dissolved into\nwater, and could not be taken\n\np. 112\n\nout again, but wherever we taste (the water) it is salt,--thus verily, O\nMaitreyi, does this great Being, endless, unlimited, consisting of nothing but\nknowledge 1, rise from out these elements, and vanish again in them. When he\nhas departed, there is no more knowledge (name), I say, O Maitreyi.' Thus\nspoke Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya.\n\n13\\. Then Maitreyi said: 'Here thou hast bewildered me, Sir, when thou sayest\nthat having departed, there is no more knowledge 2.'\n\nBut Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya replied: 'O Maitreyi, I say nothing that is\nbewildering. This is enough, O beloved, for wisdom 3.\n\n'For when there is as it were duality, then one sees the other, one smells the\nother, one hears the other 4, one salutes the other 5, one perceives the other\n6, one knows the other; but when the Self only is all this, how should he\nsmell another 7, how should he see 8 another 9, how should he hear 10 another,\nhow should he salute 11 another, how should he perceive another 12, how should\nhe know another? How should he know Him by whom he knows all this?\n\np. 113\n\n[paragraph continues] How, O beloved, should he know (himself), the Knower\n[1](sbe15062.htm#fn_368)?'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[108:2](sbe15061.htm#fr_340) Madhyandina text, p. 1062. To the end of the\nthird Brahma _n_ a of the second Adhyaya, all that has been taught does not\nyet impart the highest knowledge, the identity of the personal and the true\nSelf, the Brahman. In the fourth Brahma _n_ a, in which the knowledge of the\ntrue Brahman is to be set forth, the Sa _m_ nyasa, the retiring from the\nworld, is enjoined, when all desires cease, and no duties are to be performed\n(Sa _m_ nyasa, pariva _g_ ya). The story is told again with slight variations\nin the B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka-upanishad IV, 5. The more important variations,\noccurring in IV, 5, are added here, marked with B. There are besides the\nvarious readings of the Madhyandina _s_ akha of the _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a.\nSee also Deussen, Vedanta, p. 185.\n\n[108:3](sbe15061.htm#fr_341) In B _ri_ h. Up. IV, 5, the story begins: Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ avalkya had two wives, Maitreyi and Katyayani. Of these Maitreyi was\nconversant with Brahman, but Katyayani possessed such knowledge only as women\npossess.\n\n[108:4](sbe15061.htm#fr_342) Instead of udyasyan, B. gives pravra _g_ ishyan,\nthe more technical term.\n\n[108:5](sbe15061.htm#fr_343) Should I be immortal by it, or no? B.\n\n[109:1](sbe15061.htm#fr_344) Tell that clearly to me. B.\n\n[109:2](sbe15061.htm#fr_345) Thou who art dear to me, thou hast increased what\nis dear (to me in this). B.\n\n[109:3](sbe15061.htm#fr_346) B. adds, Verily, cattle are not dear, &c.\n\n[110:1](sbe15061.htm#fr_347) B. inserts, Verily, the Vedas are not dear, &c.\n\n[110:2](sbe15061.htm#fr_348) When the Self has been seen, heard, perceived,\nand known. B.\n\n[110:3](sbe15061.htm#fr_349) The commentator translates, 'should be\nabandoned.'\n\n[110:4](sbe15061.htm#fr_350) B. inserts, Whosoever looks for the Vedas, &c.\n\n[110:5](sbe15061.htm#fr_351) B. adds, these Vedas.\n\n[110:6](sbe15061.htm#fr_352) B. has, all these creatures.\n\n[110:7](sbe15061.htm#fr_353) I construe sa yatha with evam vai in \xc2\xa7 12,\nlooking upon p. 111 \xc2\xa7 11 as probably a later insertion. The sa is not the\npronoun, but a particle, as in sa yadi, sa _k_ et, &c.\n\n[111:1](sbe15061.htm#fr_354) B. adds, what is sacrificed, what is poured out,\nfood, drink, this world and the other world, and all creatures.\n\n[111:2](sbe15061.htm#fr_355) See _Kh_ and. Up. VI, 13.\n\n[112:1](sbe15061.htm#fr_356) As a mass of salt has neither inside nor outside,\nbut is altogether a mass of taste, thus indeed has that Self neither inside\nnor outside, but is altogether a mass of knowledge. B.\n\n[112:2](sbe15061.htm#fr_357) 'Here, Sir, thou hast landed me in utter\nbewilderment. Indeed, I do not understand him.' B.\n\n[112:3](sbe15061.htm#fr_358) Verily, beloved, that Self is imperishable, and\nof an indestructible nature. B.\n\n[112:4](sbe15061.htm#fr_359) B. inserts, one tastes the other.\n\n[112:5](sbe15061.htm#fr_360) B. inserts, one hears the other.\n\n[112:6](sbe15061.htm#fr_361) B. inserts, one touches the other.\n\n[112:7](sbe15061.htm#fr_362) See, B.\n\n[112:8](sbe15061.htm#fr_363) Smell, B.\n\n[112:9](sbe15061.htm#fr_364) B. inserts taste.\n\n[112:10](sbe15061.htm#fr_365) Salute, B.\n\n[112:11](sbe15061.htm#fr_366) Hear, B.\n\n[112:12](sbe15061.htm#fr_367) B. inserts, how should he touch another?\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 5](sbe15062.htm)\n\n"
