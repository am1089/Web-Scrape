The earth (is meant by the word 'anna'), on account of the subject-\nmatter, the colour, and other passages.\n\nWe read, 'Water thought, may I be many, may I grow forth. It sent forth food\n(anna)' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 2, 4).--Here a doubt arises, whether the word 'anna'\ndenotes things fit to be used as food, such as rice, barley and the like; or\ncooked food; or else the earth.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that the word is to be understood in the former\nsense; for, he says, the word 'anna' means 'food' in ordinary language, and is\nmoreover confirmed in that sense by the complementary passage, 'Therefore\nwhenever it rains anywhere, most food is then produced;' for when it rains,\nrice, barley and the like, but not earth, are produced in abundance.\n\nTo this we reply that by the word 'anna' we have to understand earth as being\nproduced from water.--Why?--On account of the subject-matter, on account of\nthe colour, and on account of other passages.--The subject-matter, in the\nfirst place, is clearly connected with the elements, as we see from the\npreceding passages, 'it sent forth fire, it sent forth water.' It would\ntherefore be improper to pass over a further element, viz. earth, when its\nturn has come, and to assume without reason that rice and the like are meant\nby the word 'anna.'--In the second place, we find that in a complementary\npassage there is mentioned a colour which agrees with earth, 'the black colour\n(of fire) is the colour of anna.' Eatable things on the other hand, such as\ncooked dishes, and rice, barley and the like, are not necessarily black.--But\nearth too is not necessarily black; for the soil of some fields has a whitish\ncolour like milk, and that of others looks red like glowing coals!--True, but\nthat does not affect our argument, since what we have to look to is the\npredominant colour. Now the predominant colour of earth is black, not either\nwhite or red. The Paura _n_ ikas also designate the colour of the earth by the\nterm 'night'\n\np. 24\n\n[paragraph continues] ( _s_ arvari); now the night is black, and we therefore\nconclude that black is the colour of earth also.--In the third place other\nscriptural passages also, which refer to the same subject, declare that 'from\nwater (sprang) earth' (Taitt. Up. II, 1), and that 'what was there as the\nfroth of the water, that was hardened and became the earth' (B _ri_. Up. I, 2,\n2). On the other hand the text declares that rice and the like were produced\nfrom the earth, 'From earth sprang herbs, from herbs food' (Taitt. Up. II, 1).\n--As, thus, the general subject-matter as well as other arguments clearly\nproves that the word 'anna' here denotes earth, we can in no way accept the\nview that rice and the like are referred to. The common use of language to\nwhich the purvapakshin appeals is of no avail against the arguments favouring\nour interpretation. The complementary passage also ('whenever it rains,' &c.)\nis to be viewed as pointing out that, owing to the earthy nature of food\n(rice, &c.), earth itself mediately springs from water.--For all these reasons\nthe word 'anna' denotes this earth.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 13](sbe38014.htm)\n\n"
