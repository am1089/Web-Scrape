Charm for the prosperity of cattle.\n\n1\\. With a firmly founded stable, with wealth, with well-being, with the name\nof that which is born on a lucky day do we unite you (O cattle)!  \n2\\. May Aryaman unite you, may Pushan, Brihaspati, and Indra, the conqueror of\nbooty, unite you! Do ye prosper my possessions!  \nFlocking together without fear, making ordure in this stable, holding honey\nfit for soma, free from disease, ye shall come hither!  \n4\\. Right here come, ye cows, and prosper here like the saka-bird! And right\nhere do ye beget (your youn(y)! May ye be in accord with me!  \n5\\. May your stable be auspicious to you, prosper ye like the sari-birds and\nparrots! And right here do ye beget (your young)! With us do we unite you.  \n6\\. Attach yourselves, O cows, to me as your possessor; may this stable here\ncause you to prosper! Upon you, growing numerous, and living, may we,\nincreasing in wealth, alive, attend!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 59. Prayer to the plant arundhati for protection to\ncattle](av170.htm)\n\n'
