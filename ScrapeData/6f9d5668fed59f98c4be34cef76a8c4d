D. Barnett, [1911], at sacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\n\xc2\xa7 8\\. Upanishadic Principles.--These conceptions,\n\np. 19\n\nwhich are conveyed by the Upanishads in very diverse and often mystic and\ncontradictory utterances, may be summed up in three propositions. Firstly, the\nwhole of finite or phenomenal being is evolved from an infinite and\nunconditioned substrate of absolute reality, _Brahma_. Secondly, Brahma is\npure Thought, absolute Spirit. Thirdly, Brahma is one with the essential\nthought of each individual subject of thought, the Soul or _\xc4\x80 tm\xc4\x81._\n\n\xc5\x9aankara, in following these principles, lays down a broad distinction between\nBrahma as absolute, unqualified, and indeterminate _(nirgu \xe1\xb9\x87a)_, and Brahma as\nsecondary, determined by self-imposed limitations of space, time, and\ncausality _(sagu \xe1\xb9\x87a)_. The former is real, and object of real knowledge; the\nlatter is essentially unreal, an illusion arising from the congenital error of\nthe subject of thought, and vanishing away as soon as the latter by\nenlightenment ceases to conceive the Absolute in forms of determinate thought,\nand realises his essential unity with it. Thus all objects of thought must be\nregarded from two standpoints: the first is that of empiric experience,\ndetermined by conditions of space, time, and causality; the second is\ntranscendental, admitting the existence of nothing but an absolute unqualified\nOne. Sankara argues from both standpoints without much regard for consistency.\nHe justifies the Upanishadic habit of describing Brahma under\n\np. 20\n\nthe qualified forms of empirical thought, or as represented by a symbol, as a\nconcession to feebler intellects, which cannot comprehend an abstract and\nunqualified principle, and are by these representations induced to worship\nBrahma in his qualified character, and thereby to attain freedom from\nignorance and sin, worldly welfare, and "gradual release," _krama-mukti_ (see\n\xc2\xa7 25), whereas the true essence of Brahma is conveyed only by those passages\nwhich deny of him all qualification (see especially his commentary on Ch.\nVIII. i. and on Brahma-s\xc5\xabtra, I. iii. 14 f., III. ii. 11 f.).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Origin of the Universe from Brahma](brk12.htm)\n\n'
