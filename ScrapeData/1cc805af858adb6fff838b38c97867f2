And on account of Sm _ri_ ti.\n\nSm _ri_ ti also declares this prohibition of hearing, and so on. 'The ears of\nhim who hears the Veda are to be filled with molten lead and lac; if he\npronounces it his tongue is to be slit; if he preserves it his body is to be\ncut through.' And 'He is not to teach him sacred duties or vows.'--It is thus\na settled matter that the _S_ udras are not qualified for meditations on\nBrahman.\n\nWe must here point out that the non-qualification of _S_ udras for the\ncognition of Brahman can in no way be asserted by those who hold that a\nBrahman consisting of pure non-differenced intelligence constitutes the sole\nreality; that everything else is false; that all bondage is unreal;\n\np. 344\n\nthat such bondage may be put an end to by the mere cognition of the true\nnature of Reality--such cognition resulting from the hearing of certain texts;\nand that the cessation of bondage thus effected constitutes final Release. For\nknowledge of the true nature of Reality, in the sense indicated, and the\nrelease resulting from it, may be secured by any one who learns from another\nperson that Brahman alone is real and that everything else is falsely\nsuperimposed on Brahman. That the cognition of such truth can be arrived at\nonly on the basis of certain Vedic texts, such as 'Thou art that,' is a\nrestriction which does not admit of proof; for knowledge of the truth does not\ndepend on man's choice, and at once springs up in the mind even of an\nunwilling man as soon as the conditions for such origination are present. Nor\ncan it be proved in any way that bondage can be put an end to only through\nsuch knowledge of the truth as springs from Vedic texts; for error comes to an\nend through the knowledge of the true nature of things, whatever agency may\ngive rise to such knowledge. True knowledge, of the kind described, will\nspring up in the mind of a man as soon as he hears the non-scriptural\ndeclaration, 'Brahman, consisting of non-differenced intelligence, is the sole\nReality; everything else is false,' and this will suffice to free him from\nerror. When a competent and trustworthy person asserts that what was mistaken\nfor silver is merely a sparkling shell, the error of a _S_ udra no less than\nof a Brahma _n_ a comes to an end; in the same way a _S_ udra also will free\nhimself from the great cosmic error as soon as the knowledge of the true\nnature of things has arisen in his mind through a statement resting on the\ntraditional lore of men knowing the Veda. Nor must you object to this on the\nground that men knowing the Veda do not instruct _S_ udras, and so on, because\nthe text, 'he is not to teach him sacred things,' forbids them to do so; for\nmen who have once learned--from texts such as 'Thou art that'--that Brahman is\ntheir Self, and thus are standing on the very top of the Veda as it were, move\nno longer in the sphere of those to whom injunctions and prohibitions apply,\nand the prohibition quoted does not\n\np. 345\n\ntherefore touch them. Knowledge of Brahman may thus spring up in the mind of\n_S_ udras and the like, owing to instruction received from one of those men\nwho have passed beyond all prohibition. Nor must it be said that the instance\nof the shell and the silver is not analogous, in so far, namely, as the error\nwith regard to silver in the shell comes to an end as soon as the true state\nof things is declared; while the great cosmic error that clouds the _S_ udra's\nmind does not come to an end as soon as, from the teaching of another man, he\nlearns the truth about Reality. For the case of the _S_ udra does not herein\ndiffer from that of the Brahma _n_ a; the latter also does not at once free\nhimself from the cosmic error. Nor again will it avail to plead that the\nsacred texts originate the demanded final cognition in the mind of the Brahma\n_n_ a as soon as meditation has dispelled the obstructive imagination of\nplurality; for in the same way, i.e. helped by meditation, the non-Vedic\ninstruction given by another person produces the required cognition in the\nmind of the _S_ udra. For meditation means nothing but a steady consideration\nof the sense which sentences declaratory of the unity of Brahman and the Self\nmay convey, and the effect of such meditation is to destroy all impressions\nopposed to such unity; you yourself thus admit that the injunction of\nmeditation aims at something visible (i.e. an effect that can be definitely\nassigned, whence it follows that the _S_ udra also is qualified for it, while\nhe would not be qualified for an activity having an 'adr _is_ h _t_ a,' i.e.\nsupersensuous, transcendental effect). The recital of the text of the Veda\nalso and the like (are not indispensable means for bringing about cognition of\nBrahman, but) merely subserve the origination of the _desire_ of knowledge.\nThe desire of knowledge may arise in a _S_ udra also (viz. in some other way),\nand thereupon real knowledge may result from non-Vedic instruction,\nobstructive imaginations having previously been destroyed by meditation. And\nthus in his case also non-real bondage will come to an end.--The same\nconclusion may also be arrived at by a different road. The mere ordinary\ninstruments of knowledge, viz. perception\n\np. 346\n\nand inference assisted by reasoning, may suggest to the _S_ udra the theory\nthat there is an inward Reality constituted by non-differenced self-luminous\nintelligence, that this inward principle witnesses Nescience, and that owing\nto Nescience the entire apparent world, with its manifold distinctions of\nknowing subjects and objects of knowledge, is superimposed upon the inner\nReality. He may thereupon, by uninterrupted meditation on this inner Reality,\nfree himself from all imaginations opposed to it, arrive at the intuitive\nknowledge of the inner principle, and thus obtain final release. And this way\nbeing open to release, there is really no use to be discerned in the Vedanta-\ntexts, suggesting as they clearly do the entirely false view that the real\nbeing (is not absolutely homogeneous intelligence, but) possesses infinite\ntranscendent attributes, being endowed with manifold powers, connected with\nmanifold creations, and so on. In this way the qualification of _S_ udras for\nthe knowledge of Brahman is perfectly clear. And as the knowledge of Brahman\nmay be reached in this way not only by _S_ udras but also by Brahma _n_ as and\nmembers of the other higher castes, the poor Upanishad is practically defunct.\n--To this the following objection will possibly be raised. Man being\nimplicated in and confused by the beginningless course of mundane existence,\nrequires to receive from somewhere a suggestion as to this empirical world\nbeing a mere error and the Reality being something quite different, and thus\nonly there arises in him a desire to enter on an enquiry, proceeding by means\nof perception, and so on. Now that which gives the required suggestion is the\nVeda, and hence we cannot do without it.--But this objection is not valid. For\nin the minds of those who are awed by all the dangers and troubles of\nexistence, the desire to enter on a philosophical investigation of Reality,\nproceeding by means of Perception and Inference, springs up quite apart from\nthe Veda, owing to the observation that there are various sects of\nphilosophers. Sa _n_ khyas, and so on, who make it their business to carry on\nsuch investigations. And when such desire is once roused, Perception and\nInference alone (in the way allowed by the _S_ ankaras themselves) lead on to\n\np. 347\n\nthe theory that the only Reality is intelligence eternal, pure, self-luminous,\nnon-dual, non-changing, and that everything else is fictitiously superimposed\nthereon. That this self-luminous Reality possesses no other attribute to be\nlearned from scripture is admitted; for according to your opinion also\nscripture sublates everything that is not Brahman and merely superimposed on\nit. Nor should it be said that we must have recourse to the Upanishads for the\npurpose of establishing that the Real found in the way of perception and\ninference is at the same time of the nature of bliss; for the merely and\nabsolutely Intelligent is seen of itself to be of that nature, since it is\ndifferent from everything that is not of that nature.--There are, on the other\nhand, those who hold that the knowledge which the Vedanta-texts enjoin as the\nmeans of Release is of the nature of devout meditation; that such meditation\nhas the effect of winning the love of the supreme Spirit and is to be learned\nfrom scripture only; that the injunctions of meditation refer to such\nknowledge only as springs from the legitimate study of the Veda on the part of\na man duly purified by initiation and other ceremonies, and is assisted by the\nseven means (see above, [p. 17](sbe48006.htm#page_17)); and that the supreme\nPerson pleased by such meditation bestows on the devotee knowledge of his own\ntrue nature, dissolves thereby the Nescience springing from works, and thus\nreleases him from bondage. And on this view the proof of the non-qualification\nof the _S_ udra, as given in the preceding Sutras, holds good.--Here\nterminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'the exclusion of the _S_ udras.'\n\nHaving thus completed the investigation of qualification which had suggested\nitself in connexion with the matter in hand, the Sutras return to the being\nmeasured by a thumb, and state another reason for its being explained as\nBrahman--as already understood on the basis of its being declared the ruler of\nwhat is and what will be.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 40.
