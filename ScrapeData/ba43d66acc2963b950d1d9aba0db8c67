Formerly men and gods lived together in this world. Then the gods in\nreward of their sacrifices went to heaven, but men were left behind. Those men\nwho perform sacrifices in the same manner as the gods did, dwell (after death)\nwith the gods and Brahman in heaven. Now (seeing men left behind), Manu\nrevealed this ceremony, which is designated by the word _S_ raddha (a funeral-\noblation). 1\n\n2\\. And (thus this rite has been revealed) for the salvation of mankind. 2\n\n3\\. At that (rite) the Manes (of one's father, grandfather, and great-grand\nfather) are the deities (to whom the sacrifice is offered). But the Brahma _n_\nas, (who are fed,) represent the \xc3\x82havaniya-fire. 3\n\n4\\. That rite must be performed in each month. 4\n\np. 141\n\n5\\. The afternoon of (a day of) the latter half is preferable (for it). 5\n\n6\\. The last days of the latter half (of the month) likewise are (preferable\nto the first days).\n\n7\\. (A funeral-oblation) offered on any day of the latter half of the month\ngladdens the Manes. But it procures different rewards for the sacrificer\naccording to the time observed. 7\n\n8\\. If it be performed on the first day of the half-month, the issue (of the\nsacrificer) will chiefly consist of females.\n\n9\\. (Performed on the second day it procures) children who are free from\nthievish propensities.\n\n10\\. (If it is performed) on the third day children will be born to him who\nwill fulfil the various vows for studying (portions of the Veda).\n\n11\\. (The sacrificer who performs it) on the fourth day becomes rich in small\ndomestic animals.\n\n12\\. (If he performs it) on the fifth day, sons (will be born to him). He will\nhave numerous and distinguished offspring, and he will not die childless. 12\n\n13\\. (If he performs it) on the sixth day, he will become a great traveller\nand gambler.\n\n14\\. (The reward of a funeral-oblation performed) on the seventh day is\nsuccess in agriculture.\n\n15\\. (If he performs it) on the eighth day (its reward is) prosperity\n\n16\\. (If he performs it) on the ninth day (its reward consists in) one-hoofed\nanimals.\n\np. 142\n\n17\\. (If he performs it) on the tenth day (its reward is) success in trade.\n\n18\\. (If he performs it) on the eleventh day (its reward is) black iron, tin,\nand lead.\n\n19\\. (If he performs a funeral-oblation) on the twelfth day, he will become\nrich in cattle.\n\n20\\. (If he performs it) on the thirteenth day, he will have many sons (and)\nmany friends, (and) his offspring will be beautiful. But his (sons) will die\nyoung. 20\n\n21\\. (If he performs it) on the fourteenth day (its reward is) success in\nbattle. 21\n\n22\\. (If he performs it) on the fifteenth day (its reward is) prosperity.\n\n23\\. The substances (to be offered) at these (sacrifices) are sesamum, masha,\nrice, yava, water, roots, and fruits. 23\n\n24\\. But, if food mixed with fat (is offered), the satisfaction of the Manes\nis greater, and (lasts) a longer time,\n\n25\\. Likewise, if money, lawfully acquired, is given to worthy (persons).\n\n26\\. Beef satisfies (the Manes) for a year, 26\n\np. 143\n\n27\\. Buffalo's (meat) for a longer (time) than that.\n\n28\\. By this (permission of the use of buffalo's meat) it has been declared\nthat the meat of (other) tame and wild animals is fit to be offered.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[140:1](sbe0251.htm#fr_680) **16**. 'Intending to give the rules regarding the\nmonthly _S_ raddha, he premises this explanatory statement in order to praise\nthat sacrifice.'--Haradatta.\n\n[140:2](sbe0251.htm#fr_681) The reading 'ni _h_ _s_ reyasa ka' apparently has\ngiven great trouble to the commentators. Their explanations are, however,\ngrammatically impossible. The right one is to take 'ni _h_ _s_ reyasa as a\nVedic instrumental, for ni _h_ _s_ reyasena, which may designate the 'reason'.\nIf the dative is read, the sense remains the same.\n\n[140:3](sbe0251.htm#fr_682) 'The comparison of the Brahma _n_ as with the\n\xc3\x82havaniya indicates that to feed Brahma _n_ as is the chief act at a _S_\nraddha.'--Haradatta.\n\n[140:4](sbe0251.htm#fr_683) Manu III, 122, 123; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 217.\n\n[141:5](sbe0251.htm#fr_684) Manu III, 255, 278.\n\n[141:7](sbe0251.htm#fr_685) Manu III, 277; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 264, 265.\n\n[141:12](sbe0251.htm#fr_686) The translation follows the corrected reading\ngiven in the Addenda to the Critical Notes.\n\n[142:20](sbe0251.htm#fr_687) Others read the last part of the Sutra,\nayuvamarmas-tu bhavanti, 'they will not die young'--Haradatta. If the two\nhalves of the Sutra are joined and Dar _s_ aniyapatyoyuvamari _n_ a _h_ is\nread, the Sandhi may be dissolved in either manner.\n\n[142:21](sbe0251.htm#fr_688) Manu III, 276, and Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 263, declare\nthe fourteenth day to be unfit for a _S_ raddha, and the latter adds that _S_\nraddhas for men killed in battle may be offered on that day. This latter\nstatement explains why \xc3\x82pastamba declares its reward to be 'success in\nbattle.' The nature of the reward shows that on that day Kshatriyas, not\nBrahma _n_ as, should offer their _S_ raddhas.\n\n[142:23](sbe0251.htm#fr_689) Manu III, 267; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 257.\n\n[142:26](sbe0251.htm#fr_690) Manu III, 271.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na II, Pa _t_ ala 7, Kha _n_ _d_ a 17](sbe0252.htm)\n\n"
