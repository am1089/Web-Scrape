Vyasa said :-- O King! When I asked him why this delusion overtook me,\nMahar _s_ i Narada smiled and said :-- \xc2\x93O son of Paras\xc2\x92ara! You are thoroughly\nacquainted with all the Pura _n_ as. Why then are you making this question\nabout the cause of my Moha (delusion). No embodied soul can exist in this\nSamsara without this Moha. Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, Rudra, and the other Devas,\nS\xc2\x92anaka, Kapila and the other Ri _s_ is, all these are surrounded by Maya and\nare thus travelling in this path of Samsara. The people know me as a J\xc3\xb1anin;\nbut I, too, am deluded like an ordinary man. I am now speaking to you as\ncertain as anything my of previous history now. I was deluded by Maya; hear it\nattentively. O Son of Vasavi! Great troubles and pains were felt by me before,\ndue to this Moha, for my wife. One day Parvata and I, the two Devar _s_ is,\nwent out together from the Devaloka to see the excellent portion of the earth\nnamed Bharata and came to the Martyaloka or the land of the mortals. We then\nbegan to travel over various places and saw the places of pilgrimages and the\nholy places and the beautiful hermitages of the Munis. Before we went out from\nthe Devaloka, we consulted with each other and entered into this agreement\nthat we would not hide our feelings from each other, whether they be good or\nbad, while we would travel over the face of the earth. Whether it be our\ndesire to get food, or wealth or women for enjoyment, whatever arises in the\nmind of any of us, we would express that freely amongst ourselves. Thus making\nan agreement, we went out in right earnest as Munis to travel over the face of\nthis earth. Thus roaming all over the face of the earth, at the end of the\nsummer season, when the rainy season commenced we came to the beautiful city\nof the King named S\xc2\x92anjaya. The King showed us great respect and worshipped us\nwith devotion. Since then we remained for four months at his house.\n\n\n\n14-33. During the four months of the rainy season, the roads are always almost\nimpassable; it is, therefore, wise to stay at one place. For eight months, the\nDvijas should always remain abroad on some work\n\n\n\np. 576\n\n\n\nor other. Thinking all these, we two began to stay in the house of the King\nS\xc2\x92anjaya. That liberal minded King gladly and with respect kept us as his\nguests and tendered to us all our requirements. The King had a very beautiful\ndaughter named Damayanti, with good teeth. The King ordered her to take care\nof us. That large-eyed princess, of great discrimination, was very energetic,\nday and night. She began to serve both of us. In due time she gave us water\nfor our bath, excellent meat, food, towels for cleaning and rubbing our faces,\nin fact, everything what we desired. She kept ready for us whatever we\ndesired, fans, seats, beds, whatever were necessary for us. Thus she began to\nserve. We were also engaged in the study of our Vedas and in those practises\nthat were approved by the Vedas. O Dvaipayana! I used to sing, then, with lute\nin my hands, the sweet lovely Sama Gayatri songs in tunes and good Svaras. The\nprincess herself appreciated the songs and when she heard these Sama songs\nravishing to one\xc2\x92s mind, she became attached to me and showed signs of\naffection. Day by day the attachment towards me grew stronger. Seeing her\nattached to me, my mind also became attached to her. Thus that princess\nindulged in amorous sentiments towards me and began to make slight\ndistinctions between the food and other things offered to me and Parvata. I\ngot warm water for my bath and Parvata used to get cold water; I got nice\ncurds when food was served to me whereas Parvata got only whey. I got nice\nwhite bedding for myself to sleep on whereas Parvata had merely a dirty sheet\nto lie down. Thus the princess began to serve me with great love and devotion\nbut not so she served Parvata. The fair lady began to look at me with eyes of\nlove; not so towards Parvata. Parvata was very much surprised to see all this\nand thought within himself, \xc2\x93What is this?\xc2\x94 Parvata, then, asked me in private\n:-- \xc2\x93O Narada! Speak out to me truly in detail. The princess shews with much\ngladness and affection her deep love towards you; she serves you with dainty\ndishes but she behaves not so with me. I therefore suspect when I see all\nthese distinctions made between you and me, that the daughter of the King\nS\xc2\x92anjaya wants with her heart and soul to make you her husband. And you also\nwant to make her your wife. 1 have come to know this by signs and symptoms;\nfor affection and love reigning inside can be made out by outward expressions\nof eyes and face. Whatever this be, O Muni! Now speak truly to me; do never\ntell a lie. When we went out from the Heavens, we made out that agreement; now\nremember that.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n34-42. Narada said :-- Thus questioned suddenly by Parvata, I became very much\nabashed and said :-- \xc2\x93O Parvata! This large-eyes princess is ready to marry me\nand I am also very much attracted towards\n\n\n\np. 577\n\n\n\nher.\xc2\x94 When Parvata heard all these, he became very much angry and uttered\nrepeatedly, \xc2\x93Fie! O Narada! Fie! O Narada! First you swore on oath and then\nyou deceived me afterwards. Therefore, O Deceiver of friends! I curse you and\nlet your face become that of a monkey.\xc2\x94 When the high-souled Parvata cursed\nthus, the face turned immediately into that of a monkey, elongated and\ndistorted. I did not excuse him, though he was my sister\xc2\x92s son. I also got\nangry and cursed him, \xc2\x93Certainly, your journey to the Heavens will be stopped.\nYou will not be able to go to Heaven. O Parvata! When you cursed me so heavily\nfor so trivial a fault of mine, I see you are very mean. Whatever it be, you\nwill have to remain on earth so long.\xc2\x94 At this Parvata became very sad and\nwent out of the city. My face became immediately like that of a monkey. The\ndaughter of the King became very sorry to see my face thus distorted into that\nof a monkey. I did not see her glad as she was before; but her desire to hear\nmy playing with my lute remained the same as before.\n\n\n\n43-52. Vyasa said :-- O Muni! What happened next? How did you get yourself rid\nof your curse and how did you get your man-like face? Whither did Parvata Ri\n_s_ i go! When and how did you again re-unite with each other? Kindly describe\nall these to me in detail. Narada said :-- \xc2\x93O Highly Intelligent One! What\nshall I say about the nature of Maya? When Parvata went away angrily, the\ndaughter of the King began to serve me with greater care than before. I\nremained there, though Parvata went away, and seeing my face monkey-like, I\nbecame very dejected and sorry and was specially troubled with the care and\nanxiety what would happen to me hereafter? The King S\xc2\x92anjaya saw that his\ndaughter Damayanti was slipping into her youth and asked the prime minister\nabout her marriage. He said :-- \xc2\x93The time of marriage of my dear daughter has\nnow come; I will now marry her in accordance with due rites and ceremonies.\nNow tell me particularly about a prince worthy of her, as we like, in beauty,\nqualifications, largeheartedness, calmness, patience and heroism and who is of\na good family.\xc2\x94 The minister said :-- \xc2\x93O King! There are many princes on the\nface of this earth, worthy in all respects, of your daughter. Whomever you\nlike, you can call on him and give him your daughter with elephants, horses,\nchariots, wealth, gems and jewels.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n53-57. Damayanti, knowing the intention of his father informed the King of her\nown desire by her nurse and attendant. The nurse went to the King and said :--\n\xc2\x93When my father will sit at his ease and comfort you would go and speak to him\nin private that I am enchanted with the\n\n\n\np. 578\n\n\n\nenchanting Nada sound of the great lute played by the Mahar _s_ i Narada and\nhave selected him as my bridegroom. No other person will be dear to me. O\nFather! Marry me with Narada and thus fulfil my desire; O Knower of Dharma! I\nwon\xc2\x92t marry anybody but Narada. O Father! I am now merged in the Nada-ocean\n(sound ocean) of bliss, sweet and joyful, void of anything destructive of\nhappiness, void of Nakra, alligators, and fishes, Timingala, etc. (injurious\nanimals) and without any salty taste; my mind won\xc2\x92t be satisfied with any\nother thing.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty sixth Chapter of the Sixth Book on the description by\nNarada of his own Moha in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of\n18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 27](bk06ch27.htm)\n\n'
