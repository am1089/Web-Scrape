In the absence of a body, as in the state of dream; that being possible.\n\nAs in the absence of a body and other instruments of enjoyment created by\nhimself, the Released may undergo experiences of pleasure by means of\ninstruments created by the highest Person, the Released, although capable of\nrealising all his wishes, may not himself be creative. As in the state of\ndream the individual soul has experiences depending on chariots and other\nimplements created by the Lord ('He creates chariots, horses,' &c., B _ri_.\nUp. IV, 3, 10); thus the released soul also may have experience of different\nworlds created by the Lord engaged in playful sport.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 14.
