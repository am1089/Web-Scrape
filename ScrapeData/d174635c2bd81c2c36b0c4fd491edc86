Now Varu _n_ a established this (fire), being desirous of\nsovereignty. He obtained sovereignty; and, accordingly, whether one (who has\nestablished the fires) knows (this) or not, they call him 'king Varu _n_ a.'\nSoma (established the fire), being desirous of glory. He became glorious, and,\naccordingly, whether one obtains a hold on Soma, or whether\n\np. 314\n\none does not, they both obtain (glory),--for it is glory that people thereby\nget to see. Glorious therefore he becomes, and sovereignty he obtains,\nwhosoever, knowing this, establishes a sacrificial fire of his own.\n\n2:2:3:22\\. Now once upon a time the gods deposited with Agni all forms (rupa)\n1, both domestic and wild; either because they were about to engage in battle,\nor from a desire of free scope, or because they thought that he (Agni) would\nprotect them as the best protector.\n\n2:2:3:33\\. But Agni coveted them, and seizing them he entered the seasons with\nthem. 'Let us go back thither,' said the gods, and betook themselves to the\nplace where) Agni (was) concealed. They were disheartened and said, 'What is\nhere to be done? what counsel is there?'\n\n2:2:3:44\\. Then Tvash _t_ _ri_ beheld that re-consecrated fire (Punar-adheya).\nHe established it and thereby gained an entrance to Agni's beloved abode. He\n(Agni) gave up to him both kinds of forms, domestic and wild: hence they call\nthem Tvash _t_ _ri_ 's forms; since it is from Tvash _t_ _ri_ that all form\nproceeds 2; but all other creatures of whatever kind undergo it.\n\n2:2:3:55\\. It is for him (Tvash _t_ _ri_ ), then, that one must re-establish\nthe fire: for thus he enters Agni's\n\np. 315\n\nbeloved abode, and the latter gives up to him both kinds of forms, domestic\nand wild. In that (fire) those two kinds of forms are seen: such is the\nascendancy (which one obtains by the punaradhyeya),--people, indeed, envy him;\nthus he thrives, and a conspicuous position (is obtained by him).\n\n2:2:3:66\\. To Agni belongs this sacrifice. Agni is the light, the burner of\nevil: he burns away the evil of this (sacrificer): and the latter becomes a\nlight of prosperity and glory in this, and a light of bliss 1 in yonder,\nworld. This, then, is the reason why he should establish the fires (a second\ntime).\n\n2:2:3:77\\. Let him establish the fires (the second time) in the rainy season.\nThe rains are all the seasons, for the rains are indeed all the seasons:\nhence, in counting over years, people say, 'In such and such a year (or rain,\nvarsha) we did it; in such and such a year (or rain) we did it.' The rains,\nthen, are one of the forms of manifestation (rupa) of all seasons 2; and when\npeople say, 'To-day it is as if in summer,' then that is in the rainy season;\nand when they say, 'To-day it is as if in spring,' then that, too, is in the\nrainy season. From the year (or rain, varsha), indeed, (is named) the rainy\nseason (varsha _h_ ).\n\n2:2:3:88\\. There is, moreover, an occult form (through which the rains\nmanifest themselves in the seasons) 3. When it blows from the east, then that\nis the characteristic sign of spring:--when it thunders, it is that of\n\np. 316\n\nsummer;--when it rains, it is that of the rainy season; when it lightens, it\nis that of autumn 1;--when it ceases to rain, it is that of winter. The rains\nare all the seasons. The seasons he (Agni) entered: from out of the seasons,\ntherefore, he now produces him.\n\n2:2:3:99\\. But the sun also is all the seasons: when he rises, then it is\nspring;--when the cows are driven together (for milking), then it is\nsummer;--when it is mid-day, then is the rainy season;--when it is afternoon,\nthen it is autumn;--when he sets, then it is winter. At mid-day (madhyandina),\ntherefore, he should establish his fires, for then that (sun) is nearest to\nthis world, and hence he produces that (fire) from the nearest centre\n(madhya).\n\n2:2:3:1010\\. Verily, this man is affected with evil, as with a shadow. But\nthen (at mid-day) that (evil) of his (like his shadow) is smallest, and\nshrinks, as it were, beneath his foot: hence he thereby crushes that evil,\nwhen it is smallest. For this reason also he should establish his fires (the\nsecond time) at mid-day.\n\n2:2:3:1111\\. He takes it out (from the Garhapatya) by means of sacrificial\ngrass. By means of fire-wood, indeed, he takes it out the first time; and\n(were he to take it out) with fire-wood the first time, and with fire-wood the\nsecond time, he would commit a repetition, and raise a conflict. Now\nsacrificial grass means water, and the rainy season also means water. He\n(Agni) entered the seasons: with water he accordingly produces him from out of\nthe waters; this is why he takes it (the fire) out by means of sacrificial\ngrass.\n\n2:2:3:1212\\. Having prepared an (ordinary) rice cake on\n\np. 317\n\ntwo arka 1 leaves, he puts it in the place where he is about to establish the\nGarhapatya fire, and thereon lays down the Garhapatya.\n\n2:2:3:1313\\. Having prepared a (second) barley cake on two arka leaves, he\nputs it in the place where he is about to establish the \xc3\x82havaniya fire, and\nthereon lays down the \xc3\x82havaniya. [Some do so] arguing, 'Thereby we cover them\nwith the first two fires;' but let him not do so, for it is by the nights that\nthey come to be covered.\n\n2:2:3:1414\\. He then offers to Agni a sacrificial cake (puro _d_ asa) on five\npotsherds 2. Its offering prayers and invitatory prayers consist of pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti\nstrophes of five padas each 3; for there are five seasons, and the seasons he\n(Agni) entered: from the seasons he accordingly produces him.\n\n2:2:3:1515\\. The whole (sacrifice) belongs to Agni; for it was thereby that\nTvash _t_ _ri_ entered Agni's beloved abode, and therefore the whole\n(sacrifice) belongs to Agni 4.\n\np. 318\n\n2:2:3:1616\\. They perform it (with the formulas pronounced) in a low voice;\nfor if one wishes to prepare anything specially for a relative or friend, one\nmust take care to keep it secret. Now the other sacrifice belongs to all the\ndeities, but this belongs specially to Agni; and what is (kept) secret, that\nis (spoken of) in a low voice: this is why they perform it in a low voice.\n\n2:2:3:1717\\. The last after-offering he performs aloud; for then he has\ncompleted his work, and every one becomes aware of what has been done.\n\n2:2:3:1818\\. Having uttered his call (and having been responded to by the\n\xc3\x82gnidhra) 1, he says (to the Hot _ri_ ), 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the\nSamidhs (kindling-sticks)!'--the latter being one of Agni's mystic forms of\nmanifestation (rupa); but he may also say, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to\nthe fires!'--that being Agni's real (exoteric) form 2.\n\np. 319\n\n2:2:3:1919\\. He (the Hot _ri_ ) recites 1, '. . . They (the Samidhs), O Agni,\nmay accept of the butter! Vau _gh_ ak 2!' '. . . He (Tanunapat) may accept the\nfire of the butter! Vau _gh_ ak!' '. . . . They (the I _d_ s) may, through\nAgni, accept of the butter! Vau _gh_ ak!' '. . . It (the barhis), the fire,\nmay accept of the butter! Vau _gh_ ak!'\n\n2:2:3:2020\\. He then says 3, 'Svaha Agnim!' with reference to Agni's butter-\nportion;--'Svaha Agnim Pavamanam!' if they determine upon (offering to) Agni,\nthe blowing 4; or 'Svaha Agnim Indumantam!' if they determine upon Agni, the\ndrop-abounding 5;--'Svaha Agnim!'--'Svaha, the butter-drinking Agnis! May Agni\ngraciously accept of the butter!'--this is the offering-prayer he (the Hot\n_ri_ ) pronounces.\n\n2:2:3:2121\\. He (the Adhvaryu) then says, with regard to Agni's (first)\nbutter-portion, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni!' He (the Hot _ri_ )\nrecites 6, 'Awake Agni with praise, enkindling the immortal, that he may take\nour offerings to the gods!' For, indeed, when Agni is removed (from the\nhearth) 7, he, as it were, sleeps: he (the priest) now awakens, rouses\n\np. 320\n\nhim. For the offering-prayer he recites, 'May Agni graciously accept of the\nbutter!'\n\n2:2:3:2222\\. And, if they determine upon (offering the second butter-portion\nto (Agni Pavamana, let him then say, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni\nPavamana;' and he (the Hot _ri_ ) recites (Rig-veda IX, 16, 19), 'O Agni, thou\nbreathest forth life; produce thou food and sap for us! drive far away\nmisfortune!' For thus, indeed, it becomes of the nature of Agni. Pavamana (the\none that becomes purified) means the Soma; but this (Soma-element) they\neliminate from the butter-portion of Soma 1. For the offering-prayer he\nrecites, 'May Agni Pavamana graciously accept of the butter!'\n\n2:2:3:2323\\. If, on the other hand, they determine upon (offering to) Agni\nIndumat, let him say, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni Indumat!' He\n(the Hot _ri_ ) recites (Rig-veda VI, 16, 16), 'Come hither, I will gladly\nsing to thee yet other songs, O Agni! mayest thou grow strong by these\ndraughts (indu, drop).' Thus, indeed, it becomes of the nature of Agni: the\ndraught doubtless means Soma, but this (Soma-element) they eliminate from the\nbutter-portion of Soma. For the offering-prayer he recites, 'May Agni, the\ndrop-abounding, graciously accept of the butter!' And thus he makes it all of\nthe nature of Agni.\n\n2:2:3:2424\\. He then says, as to the chief offering (havis), 'Pronounce the\ninvitatory prayer to Agni!' 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Agni!'\n'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t (the maker of\ngood offerings)!' 'Pronounce the offering-prayer\n\np. 321\n\nto Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t 1!' Then where (otherwise) he would say,\n'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the gods 2!' he now says, 'Pronounce the\noffering-prayer to the Agnis!'\n\n2:2:3:2525\\. He recites 3, '[The divine Barhis] may accept (the offering) for\nAgni's abundant obtainment of abundant gift! Vau _gh_ ak!'--'[The divine Nara\n_s_ a _m_ sa] may accept (the offering) for abundant obtainment, in Agni, of\nabundant gift! Vau _gh_ ak!'--'The divine Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t . . . .'\nthis third (after-offering) is already in itself of the nature of Agni; and\nthus he makes the after-offerings relate to Agni.\n\n2:2:3:2626\\. Those same case-forms (of agni) 4, which he recites in the\noffering-prayers, are six; namely, four at the fore-offerings, and two at the\nafter-offerings. Now there are six seasons; and the seasons he (Agni) entered:\nout of the seasons he accordingly thereby produces him.\n\n2:2:3:2727\\. There are either twelve or thirteen syllables (in these six case-\nforms) 5. Now there are either twelve or thirteen months in a year 6; and the\n\np. 322\n\nyear, the seasons, he (Agni) entered: out of the seasons he accordingly\nthereby produces him. In order to avoid sameness, no two (of these forms) are\nalike; but (the fault of) sameness he would undoubtedly commit, were any two\nof them alike. The characteristic form of the fore-offerings is (alternately),\n'May they accept,' 'May it (or he) accept 1;' and that of the after-offerings\nis, 'For the abundant obtainment of abundant gift.'\n\n2:2:3:2828\\. The priests' fee for this (sacrifice) consists of gold 2, This\nsacrifice belongs to Agni, and gold is Agni's seed 3: this is why the priests'\nfee consists of gold. Or it may be an ox; for the latter is of the nature of\nAgni as far as its shoulder is concerned, since its shoulder (by carrying the\nyoke) is as if burnt by fire. Moreover, Agni is oblation-bearer to the gods,\nand that (ox) bears (or draws, loads) for men: this is why an ox may be given\nas the priests' fee.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[313:1](sbe1245.htm#fr_710) The Ka _n_ va text has: He said, 'Speak ye not\nthus; be thou a restrainer of speech!'--'Speak ye not,' so (he said); for,\nhaving established the two fires, one should not speak untruthfully (m _ri_\nsha), nor should he who utters speech speak untruthfully. He should,\ntherefore, strive to speak nothing but the truth.\n\n[313:2](sbe1246.htm#fr_711) If the householder who has set up his fires,\nfinds, after a year or more, that he does not prosper in his undertakings, or\nif he has otherwise met with misfortunes, and thus his adheya has not proved\nsuccessful, he should set up his fires a second time. The old fires have to be\nput out, either early in the day on which the performance is to take place, or\nfrom three nights to a whole year previous to the ceremony. With the\nexceptions noticed in the sequel, the performance is the same as that of the\nadhana.\n\n[314:1](sbe1246.htm#fr_712) Compare the corresponding legend Taitt, S. I, 5,\n1; according to which the gods deposited their precious goods (vama _m_ vasu)\nwith Agni; and Pushan and Tvash _t_ _ri_ , on performing sacrifice to Agni\nexclusively (the punaradhyeya), became possessed of the cattle, whence the\nlatter are said to belong to Pushan (paush _n_ a) and to Tvash _t_ _ri_ (tvash\n_t_ ra). Afterwards Manu and Dhat _ri_ (here identified with the year) also\nperformed the ceremony. See also _S_ at. Br. II, 3, 4, 1 seq.\n\n[314:2](sbe1246.htm#fr_713) Or, since it is to Tvash _t_ _ri_ that all form\nbelongs.\n\n[315:1](sbe1246.htm#fr_714) _G_ yotir amutra pu _n_ yalokatva, lit, 'a light\nby (way of) blissful state.' The Ka _n_ va text has the same reading.\n\n[315:2](sbe1246.htm#fr_715) This speculation is based on the identity of the\nwords for year (varsha; also 'rain') and the rains, or rainy season (varsha\n_h_ ).\n\n[315:3](sbe1246.htm#fr_716) The characteristics of the seasons here selected\nare supposed to have a special connection with the rain and rainy season.\n\n[316:1](sbe1246.htm#fr_717) During the autumn, or sultry season succeeding the\nrains, there are frequent displays of sheet-lightning along the horizon at\nnight.\n\n[317:1](sbe1246.htm#fr_718) Calotropis Gigantea. These cakes (apupa, not puro\n_d_ a _s_ a, have first to be cooked either on the Avasathya, or on a secular\nfire. Before the cakes are then put on the Garhapatya and \xc3\x82havaniya fire-\nplaces, the latter have to be consecrated in the usual way (cf. p. 2); and,\nafter the putting on of the cakes, the fire-places are sprinkled by the\nAdhvaryu, while the sacrificer holds on to him from behind. Katy. IV, 11, 8,\nSchol.\n\n[317:2](sbe1246.htm#fr_719) Viz. he performs an ish _t_ i with such a rice-\ncake for the havis, as a substitute for the tanuhavir-ish _t_ is, offered\nafter the full-offering, at the adhana. See II, 2, 1, 6, and note.\n\n[317:3](sbe1246.htm#fr_720) The pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti consists of five octosyllabic padas.\nThe anuvakya and ya _g_ ya at the chief offering are Rig-veda IV, 10, 2 and 4;\nthose of the svish _t_ ak _ri_ t, ib., verses 4 and 1.--\xc3\x82 _s_ v. II, 8, 14.\n\n[317:4](sbe1246.htm#fr_721) The offering prayers of all libations and\nofferings at this ish _t_ i must therefore contain Agni's name. At each of the\nfore-offerings and after-offerings a different case-form of agni is added\nafter the respective objects of those offerings,--thus, '. . . samidho agne p.\n318 'gna a _g_ yasya vyantu,' 'tanunapad agnim agna . . .,' 'i _d_ o agninagne\n. . .,' &c. See par. 19; also [p. 148](sbe1224.htm#page_148), n.\n[2](sbe1224.htm#fn_360); I, 5, 4, 1 seq.; I, 8, 2, 1 seq. The two butter-\nportions otherwise offered to Agni or Soma respectively (cf. I, 6, 1, 20 seq.)\nare in this case offered to Agni; the anuvakyas, according to \xc3\x82 _s_ v. II, 8,\n7, being Rig-veda VIII, 44, I, and VI, 16, 16 respectively. See, however,\nparagraphs 21 seq.\n\n[318:1](sbe1246.htm#fr_722) Viz. the Adhvaryu calls, \xc3\x95 _s_ ravaya, 'cause (him\nor one) to hear!' and the \xc3\x82gnidhra responds by Astu _s_ rausha _t_ , 'yea, may\nhe (or one) hear!'\n\n[318:2](sbe1246.htm#fr_723) Here, at the first fore-offering, an option is\napparently left between the former, regular summons (see I, 5, 3, 8), and the\nlatter, modified so as to make it apply directly to Agni. Katy. IV, 11, 11\nallows the same option for the first praya _g_ a and anuya _g_ a. For the\nlatter, however, see further on, par. 24. The Ka _n_ va recension has as\nfollows:--Now when the Adhvaryu, on stepping over (to the south side) and\nuttering his call (for the \xc3\x82gnidhra) to bid attention, says, 'Pronounce the\noffering-prayer to the Samidhs!' then that, indeed, is one of Agni's forms of\nmanifestation (agneyam eva tad rupam); but here let him say, as it were, p.\n319 in a mystic way, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the Agnis!' (paroksham\niva tv agnin ya _g_ eti haiva tatra bruyat.)\n\n[319:1](sbe1246.htm#fr_724) See p. 317, note 4.\n\n[319:2](sbe1246.htm#fr_725) A modification of the ordinary vausha _t_. The Ka\n_n_ va text has here and in par. 25, as usual, vaushal.\n\n[319:3](sbe1246.htm#fr_726) At the fifth fore-offering; see I, 5, 3, 22 seq.\n\n[319:4](sbe1246.htm#fr_727) See II, 2, 1, 6, and note; also II, 2, 1, 22.\n\n[319:5](sbe1246.htm#fr_728) This points forward to the second butter-portion,\nwhich is offered to Agni Pavamana or Agni Indumat, instead of Soma; the first\nbeing offered to Agni simply. Katy. IV, 11, I2.\n\n[319:6](sbe1246.htm#fr_729) Rig-veda V, 14, 1. See, however, the formulas\nprescribed by \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana, p. 317, note 4.\n\n[319:7](sbe1246.htm#fr_730) The fire laid down at the adheya is removed when\nthe punaradheya is to be performed.\n\n[320:1](sbe1246.htm#fr_731) Viz. that second butter-portion which by right\nbelongs to Soma (see I, 6, 1, 20 seq.), but is here offered to Agni.\n\n[321:1](sbe1246.htm#fr_732) For the formulas of the chief offering and Svish\n_t_ ak _ri_ t, see p. 317, note 3.\n\n[321:2](sbe1246.htm#fr_733) That is, at the altar-offerings; see I, 8, 2, 14.\nCf. also p. 318, note 2.\n\n[321:3](sbe1246.htm#fr_734) See I, 8, 2, 15. Here a different case-form of the\nword agni (viz. agne _h_ and agnau) is inserted in the offering-formulas of\nthe first two anuya _g_ as, immediately after the word indicating the object\nof the offering; the formula of the third and last anuya _g_ a already\ncontaining the nominative agni _h_ in the same place.\n\n[321:4](sbe1246.htm#fr_735) See p. 317, note 4.\n\n[321:5](sbe1246.htm#fr_736) The locative case agnau, inserted in the offering-\nprayer of the second after-offering, is optionally made trisyllabic by being\nwritten and pronounced agna-u.\n\n[321:6](sbe1246.htm#fr_737) For other allusions to intercalary months in the\nVedic texts, see Weber, Naxatra, II, p. 336.\n\n[322:1](sbe1246.htm#fr_738) See I, 5, 3, 35.\n\n[322:2](sbe1246.htm#fr_739) See also II, 2, 4, 15. In Taitt. S. I, 5, 12\n(referred to Katy. XI, 2, 37) 'white gold' (ra _g_ ata _m_ hira _n_ yam), i.e.\nsilver, is expressly mentioned as unsuitable for the dakshi _n_ a. The reason\nadduced is that, when the gods claimed back the goods deposited with Agni, he\nwept, and the tears he shed became silver; and hence, if one were to give\nsilver as a dakshi _n_ a, there would be weeping in his house before a year\nhad passed.\n\n[322:3](sbe1246.htm#fr_740) See II, 1, 1, 5.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 4.
