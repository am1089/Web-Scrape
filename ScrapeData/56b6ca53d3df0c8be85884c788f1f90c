 \n'Not to my charge, Sugriva, lay  \nThine injuries avenged to-day;  \nBut rather blame resistless Fate  \nThat urged me on infuriate.  \nFate ne'er agreed our lives to bless  \nWith simultaneous happiness:  \nTo dwell like brothers side by side  \nIn tender love was still denied.  \nThe Vanars' realm is thine to-day:  \nBegin, O King, thy rightful sway;  1  \nfor I must go at Yama's call  \nTo sojourn in his gloomy hall;  \nMust part and leave this very hour  \nMy life, my realm, my kingly power,  \nAnd go instead of these to gain  \nBright glory free from spot and stain.  \nNow at thy hands one boon I seek  \nWith the last words my lips shall speak,  \nAnd, though it be no easy thing,  \nperform the task I give thee, King.  \nThis son of mine, no foolish boy,  \nWorthy of bliss and nursed in joy,--  \nSee, prostrate on the ground he lies,  \nThe hot tears welling from his eyes--  \nThe child I love so well, more sweet  \nThan life itself, for woe unmeet,--  \nTo him be kindly favour shown:  \nO guard and keep him as thine own.  \nRetain him ever by thy side,  \nHis father, helper, friend, and guide.  \nFrom fear and woe his young life save,  \nAnd give him all his father gave.  \nThen Tara's son in time shall be  \nBrave, resolute, and famed like thee,  \nAnd march before thee to the fight  \nWhere stricken fiends shall own his might.  \nWhile yet a tender stripling, fame  \nShall bruit abroad his warrior name,  \nAnd brigbtlv shall his glory shine  \nFor exploits worthy of his line.  \nChild of Sushen, 2 my Tara well  \nObscurest lore can read and tell;  \nAnd, trained in wondrous art, divines  \nEach mystery of boding signs.  \nHer solemn warning ne'er despise,  \nDo boldly what her lips advise;  \nFor things to come her eye can see,  \nAnd with her words events agree.  \nAnd for the son of Raghu's sake  \nThe toil and danger undertake:  \n\nFor breach of faith were grievous wrong,  \nNor wouldst thou be unpunished long.  \nNow, brother, take this chain of gold,  \nGift of celestial hands of old,  \nOr when I die its charm will flee,  \nAnd all its might be lost with me.'  \n\nThe loving speech Sugriva heard.  \nAnd all his heart with woe was stirred.  \nRemorse and gentle pity stole  \nEach thought of triumph from his soul:  \nThus fades the light when Rahu 1b mars  \nThe glory of the Lord of Stars. 2b  \nAll angry thoughts were staved and stilled  \nAnd kindly love his bosom filled.  \nHis brother's word the chief obeyed  \nAnd took the chain as Bali prayed.  \nOn little Angad standing nigh  \nThe dying hero fixed his eye,  \nAnd, ready from this world to part,  \nSpoke the fond utterance of his heart:  \n\n'Let time and place thy thoughts employ:  \nIn woe be strong, he meek in joy.  \nAccept both pain and pleasure, still  \nObedient to Sugriva's will.  \nThou hast, my darling, from the first  \nWith tender care been softly nursed;  \nBut harder days, if thou wouldst win  \nSugriva's love, must now begin.  \nTo those who hate him ne'er incline,  \nNor count his foe a friend of thine.  \nIn all thy thoughts his welfare seek,  \nObedient, lowly, faithful, meek.  \nLet no rash suit his bosom pain,  \nNor yet from due requsts abstain.  3b  \nEach is a grievous fault, between  \nThe two is round the happy mean.'  \n\nThen Bali ceased: his eyeballs rolled  \nIn stress of anguish uncontrolled  \nHis massive teeth were bared to view,  \nAnd from the frame the spirit flew.  \nTheir lord and leader dead, the crowd  \nOf noblest Vanars shrieked aloud:  \n'Since thou, O King, hast sought the skies  \nAll desolate Kishkindha lies.  \nHer woods, where Vanars loved to rove,  \nAre empty now, and hill and grove.  \nFrom every eye the light is fled,  \nSince thou, our mighty lord, art dead.  \nThine was the unwearied arm that bore  \nThe brunt of deadly fight of yore  \nWith Golabh the Gandharva, when,  \nLasting through five long years and ten,  \n\np. 352  \n\nThe dreadful conflict knew no stay  \nIn gloom of night, in glare of day;  \nAnd when the fifteenth year had past  \nThy dire opponent fell at last.  \nIf such a foeman fell beneath  \nOur hero's arm and awful teeth  \nWho freed us from our terror, how  \nIs conquering Bali fallen now?'  \n\nThen when they saw their leader slain  \nGreat anguish seized the Vanar train,  \nWeeping their mighty chief, as when  \nIn pastures near a lion's den  \nThe cows by sudden fear are stirred,  \nSlain the bold bull who led the herd.  \nAnd hapless Tara sank below  \nThe whelming waters of her woe,  \nLooked upon Bali's face and fell  \nBeside him whom she loved go well,  \nLike a young creeper clinging round  \nA tall tree prostrate on the ground.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[350:1b](ry295.htm#fr_604) Sugriva and Angad.\n\n[351:1](ry296.htm#fr_605) Angad himself, being too young to govern, would be\nYuvaraja or heir- apparent.\n\n[351:2](ry296.htm#fr_606) Sushena was the son of Varuna the God of the sea,\n\n[351:1b](ry296.htm#fr_607) A demon with the tail of a dragon, that causes\neclipses by endeavouring to swallow the sun and moon.\n\n[351:2b](ry296.htm#fr_608) The Lord of Stars is the Moon.\n\n[351:3b](ry296.htm#fr_609) Or the passage may be interpreted: 'Be neither to\nobsequious or affectionate, nor wanting in due respect of love.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXIII.: Tara's Lament.](ry297.htm)\n\n"
