The story\nof Prajapati and Virocana.\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n[4](hm04.htm#2-4).\n\n|\n\nThe story of Maitreyi and Yajnavalkya illustrates the spiritual longing of man\nin Maitreyi\'s craving for immortality.\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n[5](hm04.htm#2-5).\n\n|\n\nThe highest state of immortality is a supra-conscious, ineffable state of\nmystic experience, where there is not the duality of the knower and the known.\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n[6](hm04.htm#2-6).\n\n|\n\nThe supra-conscious experience underlies our so-called personality as its\nbackground, essence or truth--as the true self which is dearest and nearest to\nus and for which everything is dearer to us.\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n[7](hm04.htm#2-7).\n\n|\n\nThis experience is ultimate and fundamental in its nature--the ultimate\nreality, as the ground of all things.\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n[8](hm04.htm#2-8).\n\n|\n\nThis quest after the highest reality which is also our ultimate intuitional\nexperience--a belief in a superior impersonal principle, the inmost essence of\nman, which enlivens our thoughts, actions and feelings is the chief feature of\nUpanishad mysticism.\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n[9](hm04.htm#2-9).\n\n|\n\nThe story of Naciketas and "what becomes of man after death." Philosophical\nquest of truth preferable to a life of mundane comforts.\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n[10](hm04.htm#2-10).\n\n|\n\nGrowth of materialistic civilisation leads us away from the transcendent\nspiritual ideals of life.\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n[11](hm04.htm#2-11).\n\n|\n\nThe highest spiritual essence can be realised only by inner intuitive contact\nand not by logical reasoning.\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n[12](hm04.htm#2-12).\n\n|\n\nThe fundamental essence of man is the inner illumination of pure thought,\nwhich is also the ultimate principle underlying all things.\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n[13](hm04.htm#2-13).\n\n|\n\nThis immortal essence cannot be grasped by intellect, but only realised by\nsuperior intuition, and this is the mysticism of the Upanishads.\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n[14](hm04.htm#2-14).\n\n|\n\nThere is another and different line of thought which\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n\n\n|\n\np. xvi\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nconceives Brahman as the supreme lord who moves our life and sense faculties\nto activity.\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n[15](hm04.htm#2-15).\n\n|\n\nA mythical story to illustrate the fact that all natural objects, such as\nfire, wind, etc., derive their respective functions and power from this\nsupreme lord.\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n[16](hm04.htm#2-16).\n\n|\n\nYet this supreme creator and sustainer of the universe, and the inner\ncontroller of us all, is in some other passages spoken of as having become the\nvisible many of the universe though he is in Himself one.\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n[17](hm04.htm#2-17).\n\n|\n\nThe dualistic tendency of God, soul and the world, is very prominent in some\npassages, while side by side with it there are many passages of an apparently\npantheistic import.\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n[18](hm04.htm#2-18).\n\n|\n\nYet the Upanishads seem to emphasise very strongly the view of ineffable and\nultimate experience realised by direct intuition.\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n[19](hm04.htm#2-19).\n\n|\n\nInterpreters of the Upanishads differ as to which of these strains of\nUpanishad thought is most fundamental. But in the life of a true Upanishad\nmystic all the apparently contradictory lines of thought find an untold\nharmony and expression incomprehensible to logical thought.\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n[20](hm04.htm#2-20).\n\n|\n\nThe mystic experience in the Upanishads can be attained only through the most\nrigorous moral discipline of self-abnegation, self-control and peace, by\nuntiring and patient search and by inner intuitive vision of the spirit. The\nhighest state is absolutely indescribable.\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n\n\n|\n\n  \nLECTURE III\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nYoga Mysticism\n\n|\n\n[61](hm05.htm#page_61)  \n  \n[1](hm05.htm#3-1).\n\n|\n\nPerfecting of moral life is indispensable for the realisation of Upanishad\ntruth, and references to self-control are found in some of the Upanishad\npassages.\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n[2](hm05.htm#3-2).\n\n|\n\nModes of sense-control prevalent in India since at least 700 or 800 B.
