The Prince, whose name was\nLogedas, was young and handsome, and had married the beautiful Princess,\nParbuttee Bai.\n\nNow it came to pass that Siu Rajah\'s Wuzeer bad a daughter called Seventee  3\nBai [the Daisy Lady] who was as fair as the morning. And beloved by all for\nher gentleness and goodness; and when Logedas Rajah saw her, he fell in love\nwith her, and determined to marry her. But when Sui Rajah heard of this, he\nwas very angry. And sent for his son, and said: \'Of all that is rich and\ncostly in my kingdom I have withheld nothing from you, and in Parbuttee Rajah\nyou have a wife as fair as heart could wish; nevertheless, if you are desirous\nof having a second wife, I freely give you leave; there are daughters of many\nneighbouring kings who would be proud to become your Queen, but it is beneath\nyour dignity to marry a Wuzeer\'s daughter; and if you do, my love for you\nshall not prevent my expelling you from the kngdom.\n\nLogedas did not heed his father\'s threat, and he married Seventee Bai; which\nthe Rajah learning, ordered him immediately to quit the country; but yet,\nbecause he loved him much, be gave Logedas many elephants, camels, horses,\npalanquins, and attendants, that he might not need help on the journey, and\nthat his rank might be apparent to all.\n\nSo Logedas Rajah and his two young wives set forth on their travels. Before,\nhowever, they had gone very far, the Prince dismissed the whole of his\nretinue, except the elephant on which he himself rode, and the palanquin,\ncarried by two men, in which his wives travelled. Thus, almost alone, he\nstarted through the jungle in search of a new home; but, being wholly ignorant\nof that part of the country, before they had gone very far they lost their\nway. The poor Princesses were reduced to a state of great misery; day after\nday they wandered on, living on roots, or wild berries, and the leaves of\ntrees pounded down; and at night they were terrified by the cries of wild\nbeasts in search of prey. Logedas Rajah became more melancholy and desponding\nevery day; until, one night, maddened by the thought of his wives\' sad\ncondidon, and unable longer to bear the sight of their distress, he got up,\nand casting aside his royal robes, twisted a coarse handkerchief about his\nhead after the manner of a fakeer\'s turban, and throwing a long woollen cloak\naround him, ran away in disguise into the jungle.\n\nA little while after he had gone, the Wuzeer\'s daughter awoke and found\nParbuttee Bai crying bitterly. \'Sister dear,\' said she, \'what is the matter?\'\n\'Ah, sister,\' answered Parbuttee Bai, \'I am crying because in my dreams I\nthought our husband had dressed himself like a fakeer, and run away into the\njungle; and I awoke and found it was all true: he has gone and left us here\nalone. It would have been better we had died, than that such an evil should\nhave befallen us.\' \'Do not cry,\' said Seventee Bai; \'if we cry, we are lost,\nfor the palkee-bearers will think we are two weak women, and will run away,\nand leave us in the jungle, out of which we can never get by ourselves. Keep a\ncheerful mind and all will be well; who knows but we may yet find our husband?\nMeanwhile, I will dress myself in his clothes, and take the name of Seventee\nRajah, and you shall be my wife: and the palkee-bearers will think it is only\nI that have been lost; and it will not seem very wonderful to them that in\nsuch a place as this a wild beast should have devoured me.\'\n\nThen Parbuttee Bai smiled and said, \'Sister, you speak well; you have a brave\nheart. I will be your little wife.\'\n\nSo Seventee Bai dressed herself in her husband\'s clothes, and next day she\nmounted the elephant as he had done, and ordered the bearers to take up the\npalkee in which Parbuttee Bai was, and again attempt to find their way out of\nthe jungle. The palkee-bearers wondered much to themselves what had become of\nSeventee Bai, and they said to one another, \'How selfish and how fickle are\nthe rich! See now our young Rajah, who married the Wuzeer\'s daughter and\nbrought all this trouble on himself thereby (and in truth \'tis said she was a\nbeautiful lady); he seemed to love her as his own soul; but now that she has\nbeen devoured by some cruel animal in this wild jungle, he appears scarcely to\nmourn her death.\'\n\nAfter journeying for some days under the wise direction of the Wuzeer\'s\ndaughter, the party found themselves getting out of the jungle, and at last\nthey came to an open plain, in the middle of which was a large city. When the\ncitizens saw the elephant coming, they ran out to see who was on it, and\nreturning, told their Rajah that a very handsome Rajah, richly dressed, was\nriding towards the city, and that he brought with him his wife--a most lovely\nPrincess. Whereupon the Rajah of that country sent to Seventee Bai, and asked\nher who she was, and why she had come. Seventee Bai replied, \'My name is\nSeventee Rajah. My father was angry with me, and drove me from his kingdom;\nand I and my wife have been wandering for many days in the jungle, where we\nlost our way.\'\n\nThe Rajah and all his Court thought they had never seen so brave and royal-\nlooking a Prince; and the Rajah said, that if Seventee Rajah would take\nservice under him, he would give him as much money as he liked. To whom the\nWuzeer\'s daughter replied, \'I am not accustomed to take service under anybody;\nbut you are good to us in receiving us courteously and offering us your\nprotection; therefore, give me whatever post you please, and I will be your\nfaithful servant.\' So the Rajah gave Seventee Bal a salary of \xc2\xa324,000 a year\nand a beautiful house, and treated her with the greatest confidence,\nconsulting her in all matters of importance, and intrusting her with many\nState affairs; and from her gentleness and kindness, none felt envious at her\ngood fortune, but she was beloved and honoured by all; and thus these two\nPrincesses lived for twelve years in that city. No one suspected that Seventee\nBai was not the Rajah she pretended to be; and she most strictly forbade\nParbuttee Bai\'s making a great friend of anybody, or admitting any one to her\nconfidence--for, she said, \'Who knows, then, but some day you may unawares\nreveal that I am only Seventee Bai; and, though I love you as my very sister,\nif that were told by you, I would kill you with my own hands.\'\n\nNow the king\'s palace was on the side of the city nearest to the jungle, and\none night the Ranee was awakened by loud and piercing shrieks coming from that\ndirection; so she woke her husband, and said, \'I am so frightened by that\nterrible noise that I cannot sleep. Send some one to see what is the matter.\'\nAnd the Rajah called all his attendants, and said, \'Go down towards the jungle\nand see what that noise is about.\' But they were all afraid, for the night was\nvery dark, and the noise very dreadful--and they said to him, \'We are afraid\nto go. We dare not do so by ourselves. Send for this young Rajah who is such a\nfavourite of yours, and tell him to go. He is brave. You pay him more than you\ndo us all. What is the good of your paying him so much unless he can be of use\nwhen he is wanted?\' So they all went to Seventee Bai\'s house, and when she\nheard what was the matter, she jumped up, and said she would go down to the\njungle to see what the noise was.\n\nThis noise had been made by a Rakshas, who was, standing under a gallows on\nwhich a thief had been hanged the day before. He had been trying to reach the\ncorpse with his cruel claws; but it was just too high for him, and he was\nhowling with rage and disappointment. When, however, the Wuzeer\'s daughter\nreached the place, no Rakshas was to be seen; but, in his stead, a very old\nwoman, in a wonderful glittering saree, sitting wringing her withered hands\nunder the gallows-tree, and above--the corpse, swaying about in the night\nwind. \'Old woman,\' said Seventee Bai, \'what is the matter?\' \'Alas!\' said the\nRakshas (for it was he), \'my son hangs above on that gallows. He is dead, he\nis dead! and I am too bent with age to be able to reach the rope and cut his\nbody down.\' \'Poor old woman!\' said Seventee Bai; \'get upon my shoulders, and\nyou will then be tall enough to reach your son.\' So the Rakshas mounted on\nSeventee Bai\'s shoulders, who held him steady by his glittering saree. Now, as\nshe stood there, Seventee Bai began to think the old woman was a very long\ntime cutting the rope round the dead man\'s neck; and just at that moment the\nmoon shone out from behind a cloud, and Seventee Bai, looking up, saw that\ninstead of a feeble old woman she was supporting on her shoulders a Rakshas,\nwho was tearing down portions of the flesh and devouring it. Horror-stricken,\nshe sprang back, and with a shrill scream the Rakshas fled away, leaving in\nher hands the shining saree.\n\nSeventee Bai did not choose to say anything about this adventure to the Ranee,\nnot wishing to alarm her; so on returning the palace, she merely said that the\nnoise was made by an ol woman whom she had found crying under the gallows. She\nthe returned home, and gave the bright saree to Parbuttee Bai.\n\nOne fine day, some time after this, two of the Rajah\'s little daughters\nthought they would go and see Parbuttee Bai; and it happened, Parbuttee Bai\nhad on the Rakshas\' saree, and was standing by the half-closed window-shutters\nlooking out, whe the Princesses arrived at her house. The little Princesses\nwere quite dazzled by the golden saree, and running home said to the mother,\n\'That young Rajah\'s wife has the most beautiful saree we ever saw. It shines\nlike the sun, and dazzles one\'s eyes. We ha~ no sarees half so beautiful, and\nalthough you are Ranee you have none so rich as that. Why do you not get one\ntoo?\'\n\nWhen the Ranee heard about Parbuttee Bai\'s saree, she was very eager to have\none like it; and she said to the Rajah, \'Your servant\'s wife is dressed more\nrichly than your Ranee. I hear Parbuttee Bai has a saree more costly than any\nof mine. Now, therefore, I beg you to get me one like hers; for I cannot rest\nuntil I have one equally costly.\'\n\nThen the Rajah sent for Seventee Bai, and said, \'Tell me where your wife got\nher beautiful golden saree; for the Rane desires to have one like it.\'\nSeventee Bai answered, \'Noble master, that saree came from a very far country\n--even the country of the Rakshas. It is impossible to get one like it here\nbut if you will give me leave I will go and search for their country and, if I\nsucceed in finding it, bring you home sarees of the same kind.\' And the Rajah\nwas very much pleased, and ordered Seventee Bai to go. So she returned to her\nhouse and bade good bye to Parbuttee Bai, and warned her to be discreet and\ncautious and then mounting her horse, rode away in search of the Raksha\ncountry.\n\nSeventee Bai travelled for many days through the jungl going one hundred miles\neach day, and staying to rest every no and then at little villages on her\nroad.\n\nAt last, after having gone several hundred miles, she came one day to a fine\ncity situated on the banks of a beautiful river, and on the city walls a\nproclamation was painted in large letters. Seven-tee Bai inquired of the\npeople what it meant, who told her that it was to say the Rajah\'s daughter\nwould marry any man who could tame a certain pony belonging to her father,\nwhich was very viciouS. \'Has no one been able to manage it?\' asked Seventee\nBai. \'No one,\' they said. \'Many have tried, but failed miserably. The pony was\nborn on the same day as the Princess. It is so fierce that no one can approach\nit; but when the Princess heard how wild it was, she vowed she would marry no\none who could not tame it. Every one who likes is free to try.\' Then Seventee\nBai said, \'Show me the pony to-morrow. I think I shall be able to tame it.\'\nThey answered, \'You can try if you like, but it is very dangerous, and you are\nbut a youth.\' She replied, \'God gives his strength to the weak. I do not\nfear.\' So she went to sleep, and early next morning they beat a drum all round\nthe town to let every one know that another man was going to try and tame the\nRajah\'s pony, and all the people flocked out of their houses to see the sight.\nThe pony was in a field near the river, and Seventee Bai ran up to it, as it\ncame running towards her intending to trample her to death, and seized it\nfirmly by the mane, so that it could neither strike her with its fore-legs nor\nkick her. The pony tried to shake her off, but Seventee Bai clung firmly on,\nand finally jumped on its back; and when the pony found that it was mastered,\nit became quite gentle and tame. Then Seventee Bal, to show how completely she\nhad conquered, put spurs to the pony to make it jump the river, and the pony\nimmediately sprang up in the air and right across the river (which was a jump\nof three miles), and this it did three times (for it was strong and agile, and\nhad never been ridden before); and when all the people saw this they shouted\nfor joy, and ran down to the river-bank and brought Seventee Bai, riding in\ntriumph on the pony, to see the Rajah. And the Rajah said, \'O best of men, and\nworthy of all honour, you have won my daughter!\' So he took Seventee Bai to\nthe palace, and paid her great honour, and gave her jewels, and rich clothes,\nand horses and camels innumerable. The Princess also came to greet the winner\nof her hand. Then they said, \'To-morrow shall be the wedding day.\' But\nSeventee Bai replied, \'Great Rajah and beautiful Princess, I am now going on\nan important errand of my own Rajah\'s; let me, I pray you, first accomplish\nthe duty on which I am bound, and on my way home I will come through this city\nand claim my bride.\' At this they were both pleased, and the Rajah said, \'It\nis well spoken. Do not let us hinder you from keeping faith with your own\nRajah. Go your way. We shall eagerly await your return, when you shall claim\nthe Princess and all your possessions, and we will have such a gay wedding as\nwas not since the world began.\' And they went out with her to the borders of\ntheir land, and showed her on her way.\n\nSo the Wuzeer\'s daughter travelled on in search of the Rakshas\' country, until\nat last one day she came in sight of another fine large town. Here she rested\nin the house for travellers for some days. Now the Rajah of this country had a\nvery beautiful daughter, who was his only child, and for her he had built a\nsplendid bath. It was like a little sea, and had high marble walls all round,\nwith a hedge of spikes at the top of the walls--so high, that at a distance it\nlooked like a great castle. The young Princess was very fond of it, and she\nvowed she would only marry a man who could jump across her bath on horseback.\nThis had happened some years before, but no one had been able to do it, which\ngrieved the Rajah and Ranee very much; for they wished to see their daughter\nhappily married. And they said to her, \'We shall both be dead before you get a\nhusband. What folly is this! to expect that any one should be able to jump\nover those high marble walls, with the spikes at the top.\' The Princess only\nanswered, \'Then I will never marry. It matters not; I will never have a\nhusband who has not jumped those walls.\'\n\nSo the Rajah caused it to be proclaimed throughout. the land, that he would\ngive his daughter in marriage, and great riches, to whoever could jump, on\nhorseback, over the Princess\'s bath.\n\nAll this Seventee Bai learnt as soon as she arrived in the town, and she said,\n\'To-morrow I will try and jump over the Princess\'s bath.\' The country people\nsaid to her, \'You speak foolishly: it is quite impossible.\' She replied,\n\'Heaven, in which I trust, will help me.\' So next day she rose up, and saddled\nher horse, and led him in front of the palace, and there she sprang on his\nback, and, going at full gallop, leapt over the marble walls, over the spikes\nhigh up in the air, and down on to the ground on the other side of the bath;\nand this she did three times, which, when the Rajah saw, he was filled with\njoy, and sent for Seventee Bai, and said, \'Tell me your name, brave Prince;\nfor you are the only man in the world,--you have won my daughter.\' Then the\nWuzeer\'s daughter replied, \'My name is Seventee Rajah. I come from a far\ncountry on a mission from my Rajah to the country of the Rakshas; let me\ntherefore, I pray you, first do my appointed work, and if I live to return, I\nwill come through this country and claim my bride.\' To which the Rajah\nconsented, for he did not wish the Princess, his daughter, to undertake so\nlong and tiresome a journey. It was therefore agreed that the Princess should\nawait Seventee Bai\'s return at her father\'s court, and that Seventee Bai\nherself should immediately proceed on her journey.\n\nFrom this place she went on for many, many days without adventure, and\ntraversed a dense jungle, for her brave heart carried her through all\ndifficulties. At last she arrived at another large city, beautifully situated\nby a lake, with blue hills rising behind it and sheltering it from the cutting\nwinds; little gardens filled with pomegranates, jasmines, and other fragrant\nand lovely flowers reached down from the city to the water\'s edge.\n\nSeventee Bai, tired with her long journey, rode up to one of the Malees\'\nhouses, where the hospitable inmates, seeing she was a stranger and weary,\noffered her food and shelter for the night, which she thankfully accepted.\n\nAs they all sat round the fire cooking their evening meal, Seventee Bai asked\nthe Malee\'s wife about the place and the people, and what was going on in the\ntown. \'Much excitement,\' she replied, \'has for a long time been caused by our\nRajah\'s dream, which no one can interpret.\' \'What did he dream?\' asked\nSeventee Bai. \'Ever since he was ten years old,\' she replied, he has dreamed\nof a fair tree growing in a large garden. The stem of the tree is made of\nsilver, the leaves are pure gold, and the fruit is bunches of pearls. The\nRajah has inquired of all his wise men and seers where such a tree is to be\nfound; but they all replied, "There is no such tree in the world;" wherefore\nhe is dissatisfied and melancholy. Moreover, the Princess, his daughter,\nhearing of her father\'s dream, has determined to marry no man save the finder\nof this marvellous tree.\' \'It is very odd,\' said Seventee Bai; and, their\nsupper being over, she dragged her mattress outside the little house (as a man\nwould have done), and, placing it in a sheltered nook near the lake, knelt\ndown, as her custom was, to say her prayers before going to sleep.\n\nAs she knelt there, with her eyes fixed on the dark water, she saw, on a\nsudden, a glorious shining light coming slowly towards her, and discovered, in\na minute or two more, that a very large cobra was crawling up the steps from\nthe water\'s edge, having in his mouth an enormous diamond, the size and shape\nof an egg, that sparkled and shone like a little sun, or as if one of the\nstars had suddenly dropped out of heaven. The cobra laid the diamond down at\nthe top of the steps, and crawled away in search of food. Presently returning,\nwhen the night was far spent, he picked up the diamond again, and slid down\nthe steps with it into the lake. Seventee Bai knew not what to make of this,\nbut she resolved to return to the same place next night and watch for the\ncobra.\n\nAgain she saw him bring the diamond in his mouth, and take it away with him\nafter his evening meal; and again, a third night the same thing. Then Seventee\nBai determined to kill the cobra, and if possible secure the diamond. So early\nnext morning she went into the Bazaar, and ordered a blacksmith to make her a\nvery strong iron trap, which should catch hold of anything it was let down\nupon so firmly as to require the strength of twelve men to get out of it. The\nblacksmith did as he was ordered, and made a very strong trap; the lower part\nof it was like knives, and when it caught hold of anything it required the\nstrength of twelve men to break through it and escape.\n\nSeventee Bai had this trap hung up by a rope to a tree close to the lake, and\nall around she scattered flowers and sweet scents, such as cobras love; and at\nnightfall she herself got into the tree just above the trap, and waited for\nthe cobra to come as he was wont.\n\nAbout twelve o\'clock the cobra came up the steps from the lake in search of\nfood. He had the diamond in his mouth, and, attracted by the sweet scents and\nflowers, instead of going into the jungle, he proceeded towards the tree in\nwhich Seventee Bai was.\n\nWhen Seventee Bai saw him, she untied the rope and let down the trap upon him;\nbut for fear he might not be quite dead, she waited till morning before going\nto get the diamond.\n\nAs soon as the sun was up, she went to look at her prey. There he lay cold and\ndead, with the diamond, which shone like a mountain of light, in his mouth.\nSeventee Bai took it, and, tired by her night of watching, thought she would\nbathe in the lake before returning to the Malee\'s cottage. So she ran and\nknelt down by the brink, to dip her hands and face in the cool water; but no\nsooner did she touch its surface with the diamond, than it rolled back in a\nwall on either hand, and she saw a path-way leading down below the lake, on\neach side of which were beautiful houses, and gardens full of flowers, red,\nand white, and blue. Seventee Bai resolved to see whither this might lead, so\nshe walked down the path until she came opposite a large door. She opened it,\nand found herself in a more lovely garden than she had ever seen on earth;\ntall trees laden with rich fruit grew in it, and on the boughs were bright\nbirds singing melodiously, while the ground was covered with flowers, among\nwhich flew many gaudy butterflies.\n\nIn the centre of the garden grew one tree more beautiful than all the rest:\nthe stem was of silver, the leaves were golden, and the fruit was clusters of\npearls. Swinging amid the branches sat a young girl, more fair than any\nearthly lady; she had a face like the angels which men only see in dreams; her\neyes were like two stars, her golden hair fell in ripples to her feet; she was\nsinging to herself. When she saw the stranger, she gave a little cry, and\nsaid, \'Ah, my lord, why do you come here?\' Seventee Bai answered, \'May I not\ncome to see you, beautiful lady?\' Then the lady said \'O sir, you are welcome;\nbut if my father sees you here he will kill you. I am the great Cobra\'s\ndaughter, and he made this garden for me to play in, and here I have played\nthese many, many years all alone, for he lets me see no one, not even of our\nown subjects. I never saw any one before you. Speak, beautiful Prince--tell me\nhow you came here, and who you are.\' Seventee Bai answered, \'I am Seventee\nRajah: have no fear--the stern Cobra is no more.\' Then the Lady was joyful,\nwhen she heard\' that the Cobra who had tyrannised over her was dead, and she\nsaid her name was Hera Bai jungle palace to see Hera Bai, and said to her, \'I\nhave a friend whom I have not seen since he became mad twelve years ago, and\nran away into the jungle disguised as a Fakeer. I should like very much to\nfind out if he is still alive. How can I learn?\' Now Hera Bai was a very wise\nPrincess, and she answered, \'Your best plan will be to provide a great feast\nfor the poor, and cause it to be proclaimed in all lands, far and near, that\nyou are about to give it as a thank-offering for the blessings God has\nbestowed on you. The poor will flock from all countries to come to it, and\nperhaps among the rest you may find your friend.\'\n\nSeventee Bai did as Hera Bai had advised, causing two long tables to be spread\nin the jungle, whereat hundreds of poor from all parts of the world were daily\nentertained; and every day, for six months, Seventee Bai and Parbuttee Bai\nwalked down the long rows of people, apparently to see how they were getting\non, but in reality to look for Logedas Rajah; but they found him not.\n\nAt last one day, as Seventee Bai was going her accustomed round, she saw a\nwretched wild-looking man, black as pitch, with tangled hair, a thin wrinkled\nface, and in his hand a wooden bowl, such as Fakeers carry about to collect\nbroken meat and scraps of bread in; and, touching Parbuttee Bai, she said to\nher, \'See, Parbuttee, there is your husband.\' When Parbuttee Bai saw this\npitiful sight (for it was indeed Logedas; but so changed and altered that even\nhis wives hardly recognised him) she began to cry. Then Seventee Bai said, \'Do\nnot cry; go home quickly. I will take care of him.\' And when Parbuttee Bai was\ngone, she called one of the guard and said to him, \'Catch hold of that man and\nput him in prison.\' Then Logedas Rajah said, \'Why do you seize me? I have done\nno harm to any one.\' But Seventee Bai ordered the guard not to heed his\nremonstrances, but to take him to prison instantly, for she did not wish the\npeople around to discover how interested she was in him. So the guard took\nLogedas Rajah away to lock him up. Poor Logedas Rajah said to them, \'Why has\nthis wicked Rajah had me taken prisoner? I have harmed no one. I have not\nfought, nor robbed; but for twelve years I have been a wretched beggar, living\non the bread of charity.\' For he did not tell them he was a Rajah\'s son, for\nhe knew they would only laugh at him. They replied, \'You must not call our\nRajah wicked; it is you that are wicked, and not he, and doubtless he will\nhave your head cut off.\'\n\nWhen they put him in prison he begged them again to say what was to be done to\nhim. \'Oh!\' said they, \'you will certainly be hanged to-morrow morning, or\nperhaps, if you like it better, beheaded, in front of the palace.\'\n\nNow as soon as Seventee Bai got home, she sent for her head servants, and said\nto them, \'Go at once to the prison, and order the guard to give you up the\nFakeer I gave into their charge, and bring him here in a palanquin, but see\nthat he does not escape.\' Then Seventee Bai ordered them to lock up Logedas in\na distant part of the palace, and commanded that he should be washed, and\ndressed in new clothes, and given food, and that a barber should be sent for,\nto cut his hair and trim his beard. Then Logedas said to his keepers, \'See how\ngood the Rajah is to me! He will not surely hang me after this.\' \'Oh I never\nfear,\' they answered; \'when you are dressed up and made very smart, it will be\na much finer sight to see you hanged than before.\' Thus they tried to frighten\nthe poor man. After this Seventee Bai sent for all the greatest doctors in the\nkingdom, and said to them, \'If a Rajah wanders about for twelve years in the\njungle, until all trace of his princely beauty is lost, how long will it take\nyou to restore him to his original likeness?\' They answered, \'With care and\nattention it may be done in six months.\' \'Very well,\' said Seven-tee Bai,\n\'there is a friend of mine now in my palace of whom this is the case. Take him\nand treat him well, and at the end of six months I shall expect to see him\nrestored to his original health and strength.\'\n\nSo Logedas was placed under the doctors\' care; but all this time he had no\nidea who Seventee Bai was, nor why he was thu~ treated. Every day Seventee Bai\nwent to see him and talk to him. Then he said to his keepers, \'See, good\npeople, how kind this great Rajah is, coming to see me every day; he can\nintend for me nothing but good.\' To which they would answer, \'Do not be in a\nhurry; none can fathom the hearts of kings. Most probably, for all this delay,\nhe will in the end have you taken and hanged.\' Thus they amused themselves by\nalarming him.\n\nThen, some day, when Seventee Bai had been more than usually kind, Logedas\nRajah would say again, \'I do not fear the Rajah\'s intentions towards me. Did\nyou not notice how very kind he was to-day?\' And to this his keepers would\nreply--\'Doubtless it is very amusing for him, but hardly so, we should think,\nfor you. He will probably play with you for some time (as a cat does with a\nmouse); but in three months is the Rajah\'s birthday: most likely he is keeping\nyou to kill you then.\' And so the time wore on. Seventee Bai\'s birthday was\nfixed for the day also of her marriage with the Rajah\'s daughter. For this\ngreat event immense preparations were made. All over the plain outside the\ncity walls, tents made of cloth of gold were pitched in a great square, twelve\nmiles long and twelve miles broad, for the accommodation of the neighbouring\nRajahs, and in the centre was a larger tent than all the rest, covered with\njewels, and shining like a great golden temple, in which they were to\nassemble.\n\nThen Seventee Bai said to Parbuttee Bai, \'On my birthday I will restore you to\nyour husband.\' But Parbuttee Bai was vexed, and said, \'I cannot bear the\nthought of him: it is such a terrible thing to think of our once handsome\nhusband as none other than that miserable Fakeer.\'\n\nSeventee Bai smiled. \'In truth,\' she said, \'I think you will find him again\naltered, and for the better. You cannot think what a change rest and care have\nmade in him; but he does not know who we are, and as you value my happiness,\ntell no one now that I am not the Rajah.\' \'Indeed I will not, dearest sister,\'\nanswered Parbuttee Bai. \'I should in truth be loath to vex you, after all you\nhave done for me; for owing to you here have we lived happily for twelve years\nlike sisters, and I do not think as clever a woman as you was ever before born\nin this world.\'\n\nAmongst other guests invited to the wedding were Siu Rajah and his wife, and\nthe Wuzeer, Seventee Bai\'s father, and her mother. Seventee Bai arranged\nthrones for them all, made of gold, and emeralds, and diamonds, and rubies,\nand ivory. And she ordered that in the seat of honour on her left-hand side\nshould be placed the Wuzeer her father, and next to him her mother, and next\nto them Siu Rajah and his wife, and after them all the other Rajahs and\nRanees, according to their rank; and all the Rajahs and Ranees wondered much\nthat the place of honour should have been given to the stranger Wuzeer. Then\nSeventee Bai took her most costly Rajah dress, and ordered that Logedas Rajah\nshould be clothed in it, and escorted to the tent; and she took off the man\'s\nclothes which she had worn, and dressed herself in a saree. When she was\ndressed in it she looked a more lovely woman than she had before looked a\nhandsome man. And she went to the tent leading Parbuttee Bai, while with her\ncame Hera Bai and Tara Bal of more than mortal beauty, and the three other\nPrincesses clothed in the most costly robes. Then, before all the Rajah\'s and\nRanees, Seventee Bai knelt down at Logedas Rajah\'s feet, and said to him, \'I\nam your true wife. O husband, have you forgotten her whom you left in the\njungle with Parbuttee Bai twelve years ago? See here she also is; and behold\nthese rich jewels, these tents of gold, these hangings of priceless worth,\nthese elephants, camels, horses, attendants, and all this wealth. It is all\nyours, as I am yours; for I have collected all for you.\'\n\nThen Logedas Rajah wept for joy, and Siu Rajah arose and kissed Seventee Bai,\nand said to her, \'My noble daughter, you have rescued my son from misery, and\ndone more wisely and well than woman ever did before. May all honour and\nblessing attend you henceforth and for ever!\'\n\nAnd the assembled Rajahs and Ranees were surprised beyond measure, saying,\n\'Did any one ever hear of a woman doing so much!\' But more than any was the\ngood Rajah astonished, whom Seventee Bai had served so well for twelve years,\nand whose daughter she was to have married that clay; when he learnt that she\nwas a woman! It was then agreed by all, that Logedas Rajah should on that day\nbe newly married to his two wives, Parbuttee Bai and Seventee Bai; and should\nalso marry the six other beautiful Princesses--the Princess Hera Bai, the\nPrincess Tara Bai, the Rajah\'s little daughter, and the three other\nPrincesses; and that he should return with his father to his own kingdom. And\nthe weddings took place amid great splendour and rejoicings unheard of; and of\nall the fine things that were seen and done on that day it is impossible to\ntell. And afterwards Logedas Rajah, and his eight wives, and his father and\nmother, and the Wuzeer and his wife, and all their attendants, returned to\ntheir own land, where they all lived very happily ever after. And so may all\nwho read this story live happily too!\n\n![](img/11.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1](odd07.htm#fr_29) Or Singh Rajah, the Lion King.\n\n[2](odd07.htm#fr_30) I am indebted to Sir Charles Trevelyan for pointing out\nthat this is undoubtedly no other than \'Agrabham\', the \'Land\' or \'District\' of\nAgra; as Bebhum, the Land of Heaven; jonam-bhum, the land of one\'s birth;\nVirabhum, Manbhum, and any others.\n\n[3](odd07.htm#fr_31) \'Chrysanthemum indicum.\' Commonly called \'Christmas Daiy\'\nin Bombay.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV.
