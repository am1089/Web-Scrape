'Seeing that all this threefold universe keeps passing into one\nanother, O Balaki, how is it that\n\np. 166\n\nthese,--to wit, the sacrifice, Man, and Pra _g_ apati,--do not exceed one\nanother?\n\n12:3:1:22\\. Seeing that the upward Stomas follow the sacrifice, fitting\nthemselves by repetitions with Samans, how do they enter man, and how do they\nbecome united with the vital airs?\n\n12:3:1:33\\. The Praya _n_ iya Atiratra, the _K_ aturvi _m_ _s_ a day, the four\nAbhiplavas, and the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya (sha _d_ aha):how do these enter man,\nand how do they become united with the vital airs?\n\n12:3:1:44\\. Fitted out with the Abhi _g_ it, the Svarasamans join the Vishuvat\non both sides:--how do these enter man, and how do they become united with the\nvital airs?\n\n12:3:1:55\\. Setting out with the Triv _ri_ t, fitted out with the (Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_\nada _s_ a and) Saptada _s_ a, and ending with the Trayastri _m_ _s_ a; with\n(the series of stomas increasing) successively by four (syllables 1):--how do\nthese enter man, and how do they become united with the vital airs?'\n\n12:3:1:66\\. The Triv _ri_ t is his head, the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a his neck;\nand the chest, they say, corresponds to the Saptada _s_ a; the Ekavi _m_ _s_ a\nthey make the belly, and\n\np. 167\n\nthe two sides, by means of the Tri _n_ ava, correspond to the ribs.\n\n12:3:1:77\\. The Abhiplavas on both sides (of the Vishuvat) are his arms, the P\n_ri_ sh _th_ ya is the back,--so say the wise; and his spine the Brahma _n_ as\nfashion in the year by means of the (series of stomas increasing) successively\nby four (syllables).\n\n12:3:1:88\\. The Abhi _g_ it and Vi _s_ va _g_ it are his ears; and his eyes,\nthey say, correspond to the Svarasamans; the Vishuvat, they say, is the breath\nof the nostrils; and the Go and \xc3\x82yus are those two downward breathings.\n\n12:3:1:99\\. The Da _s_ aratra they call his limbs, and the Mahavrata the\nBrahma _n_ as fashion (arrange) so as to be the mouth in the year 1;--the\nSupreme Self has entered into that year endowed with all stomas and with all\nsamans: having fashioned him alike with the body, the sage is seated free from\npain 2 on the heights of the ruddy one (the sun).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[166:1](sbe44053.htm#fr_486) The Triv _ri_ t, or nine-versed stoma, is,\nhowever, followed by the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a, or fifteen-versed stoma--the\nthirteen-versed form not being in ordinary use--and these are succeeded by the\nSaptada _s_ a (17), Ekavi _m_ _s_ a (21), &c. Possibly, however, this last\nsentence may refer to the six days of the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya-sha _d_ aha for\nwhich the stomas consisting of 9, 25, 17, 21, 27 and 33 verses respectively\nare used. On the Abhi _g_ it day, each of the first four stomas is used in\nsuccession for three stotras, the four hymn-forms thus making up the twelve\nstotras of the Agnish _t_ oma. On the Vi _s_ va _g_ it day, on the other hand,\nonly three stomas are used--the Triv _ri_ t, Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a, and Saptada\n_s_ a--four stotras being assigned to each of these three hymn-forms.\n\n[167:1](sbe44053.htm#fr_487) Though the Mahavrata day is actually the last day\nbut one of the one year's sacrificial session, whilst the _K_ aturvi _m_ _s_ a\nday is the second, these two days mark really the end and beginning of the\nyear, whilst the nominal first and last days of the sessional performance may\nbe considered as consisting of mere preliminary and concluding (winding-up)\nrites. The above symbolic identification of the Mahavrata with the mouth of\nAgni-Pra _g_ apati, the Year, might thus lead one to suppose (as, indeed, is\ndone by Prof. Hillebrandt, Die Sonnwendfeste in Alt-Indien, p. 11) that if two\nsuch annual sessions were immediately to succeed each other, the Mahavrata and\nKaturvim _s_ a would fall on one and the same day. The Mahavrata, representing\n(at least symbolically) the winter-solstice, would thus mark both the end and\nthe beginning of two successive solar periods.\n\n[167:2](sbe44053.htm#fr_488) Literally, with unborn pain (or, with the pain of\none unborn).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XII, 3, 2.
