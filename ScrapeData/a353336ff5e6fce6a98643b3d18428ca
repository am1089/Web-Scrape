When you thus from afar cast forwards your measure\n[1](sbe3220.htm#an_1:39:1:1), like a blast of fire, through whose wisdom is\nit, through whose design [2](sbe3220.htm#an_1:39:1:2)? To whom do you go, to\nwhom, ye shakers (of the earth)?\n\n2\\. May your weapons be firm to attack, strong also to withstand. May yours be\nthe more glorious power, nor that of the deceitful mortal.\n\n3\\. When you overthrow what is firm, O ye men, and whirl about what is heavy,\nyou pass [1](sbe3220.htm#an_1:39:3:1) through the trees of the earth, through\nthe clefts of the rocks [2](sbe3220.htm#an_1:39:3:2).\n\n4\\. No real foe of yours is known in heaven, nor on earth, ye devourers of\nfoes! May power be yours, together with your race\n[1](sbe3220.htm#an_1:39:4:1)! O Rudras, can it be defied\n[2](sbe3220.htm#an_1:39:4:2)?\n\n5\\. They make the rocks tremble, they tear asunder the kings of the forest\n[1](sbe3220.htm#an_1:39:5:1). Come on, Maruts, like madmen, ye gods, with your\nwhole tribe.\n\n6\\. You have harnessed the spotted deer to your chariots, a red one draws as\nleader [1](sbe3220.htm#an_1:39:6:1); even the earth listened\n[2](sbe3220.htm#an_1:39:6:2) at your approach, and men were frightened.\n\n7\\. O Rudras, we quickly desire your help for our race. Come now to us with\nhelp, as of yore; thus now for the sake of the frightened Ka _n_ va\n[1](sbe3220.htm#an_1:39:7:1).\n\n8\\. Whatever fiend, roused by you or roused by men, attacks us, deprive him of\npower, of strength, and of your favours [1](sbe3220.htm#an_1:39:8:1).\n\n9\\. For you, chasing and wise Maruts, have wholly\n\np. 98\n\nprotected [1](sbe3220.htm#an_1:39:9:1) Ka _n_ va. Come to us, Maruts, with\nyour whole favours, as lightnings [2](sbe3220.htm#an_1:39:9:2) (go in quest\nof) the rain.\n\n10\\. Bounteous givers, you carry whole strength, whole power, ye shakers (of\nthe world). Send, O Maruts, against the wrathful enemy of the poets an enemy,\nlike an arrow [1](sbe3220.htm#an_1:39:10:1).\n\np. 99\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThis hymn is ascribed to Ka _n_ va, the son of Ghora. The metre varies between\nB _ri_ hati and Satob _ri_ hati, the odd verses being composed in the former,\nthe even verses in the latter metre. Each couple of such verses is called a\nBarhata Pragatha. The B _ri_ hati consists of 8 + 8 + 12 + 8, the Satob _ri_\nhati of 12+ 8 + 12+ 8 syllables. No verse of this hymn occurs in SV., VS.,\nAV.; verse 5 = TB. II, 4, 4, 3.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Ma\xc2\xb4na, which I translate by measure, is explained by Saya _n_ a as\nmeaning strength. Wilson: 'When you direct your awful vigour downwards from\nafar, as light (descends from heaven).' Benfey: 'Wenn ihr aus weiter Ferne so\nwie Strahlen schleudert euren Stolz (das worauf ihr stolz seid: euren Blitz).'\nLanglois: 'Lorsque vous lancez votre souffle puissant.' I doubt whether ma\xc2\xb4na\nis ever used in the Rig-veda in the sense of pride, which no doubt it has, as\na masculine, in later Sanskrit: cf. Halayudha, ed. Aufrecht, iv, 37. Ma\xc2\xb4na, as\na masculine, means frequently a poet in the Rig-veda, viz. a measurer, a\nthinker or maker; as a neuter it means a measure, or what is measured or made.\nThus V, 85, 5, we read:\n\nma\xc2\xb4nena-iva tasthi-va\xc2\xb4n antarikshe vi ya _h_ mame p _ri_ thivi\xc2\xb4m su\xc2\xb4rye _n_ a.\n\nHe (Varu _n_ a) who standing in the welkin has measured the earth with the\nsun, as with a measure.\n\nIn this passage, as well as in ours, we must take measure, not in the abstract\nsense, but as a measuring line, which is cast forward to measure the distance\nof an object,--a simile, perfectly applicable to the Maruts, who seem with\ntheir weapons to strike the trees and mountains when they them, selves are\nstill far off. Another explanation might be given, if ma\xc2\xb4na could be taken in\nthe sense of measure, i. e. shape or form, but this is doubtful.\n\np. 100\n\nNote 2. Varpas, which has generally been translated by body or form, is here\nexplained by praise. Benfey puts Werk (i. e. Gesang, Gebet); Langlois, maison.\nVarpas, which, without much reason, has been compared to Latin corpus, must\nhere be taken in a more general sense. Thus VI, 44, 14, asya made puru varpa\n_m_ si vidva\xc2\xb4n, is applied to Indra as knowing many schemes, many thoughts,\nmany things, when he is inspired by the Soma-juice; see I, 19, 5.\n\n### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Benfey takes vi yathana in a causative sense, you destroy, you cause\nthe trees to go asunder. But even without assigning to ya a causative meaning,\nto go through, to pierce, would convey the idea of destruction. In some\npassages, however, vi-ya is certainly used in the simple sense of passing\nthrough, without involving the idea of destruction:\n\nVIII, 73, 13. ratha _h_ viya\xc2\xb4ti rodasi (iti).\n\nYour chariot which passes through or between heaven and earth.\n\nIn other passages the mere passing across implies conquest and destruction:\n\nI, 116, 20. vi-bhinduna \xe2\x80\xa6 rathena vi parvatan \xe2\x80\xa6 ayatam.\n\nOn your dissevering chariot you went across, or, you rent, the mountains (the\nclouds).\n\nIn other passages, however, a causative meaning seems equally, and even more\napplicable:\n\nVIII, 7, 23. vi v _ri_ tram parva- _s_ a _h_ yayu _h_ vi parvatan.\n\nThey passed through V _ri_ tra piecemeal, they passed through the mountains\n(the clouds); or, they destroyed V _ri_ tra, cutting him to pieces, they\ndestroyed the clouds.\n\nLikewise I, 86, 10. vi yata vi _s_ vam atri _n_ am.\n\nWalk athwart every evil spirit, or destroy every evil spirit! See before, I,\n19, 7; 37, 7.\n\nWe must scan vi\xcc\x86 y\xcc\x84a\xcc\x86tha\xcc\x86na\xcc\x86 va\xcc\x86ni\xcc\x86na _h_ p _ri \xcc\x86_th\xcc\x84ivy\xcc\x86a\xcc\x84 _h_.\n\nNote 2. It might seem preferable to translate a\xc2\xb4 _s_ a _h_ parvatanam by the\nspaces of the clouds, for parvata means clouds in many places. Yet here, and\nstill more clearly in verse 5, where parvata occurs again, the object of the\npoet\n\np. 101\n\nis to show the strength of the Maruts. In that case the mere shaking or\nbursting of the clouds would sound very tame by the side of the shaking and\nbreaking of the forest trees. Vedic poets do not shrink from the conception\nthat the Maruts shake even mountains, and Indra is even said to have cut off\nthe mountain tops: IV. 19, 4. ava abhinat kakubha _h_ parvatanam. In the later\nliterature, too, the same idea occurs: Mahabh. Vana-parva, ver. 10974, dyau\n_h_ svit patati kim bhumir diryate parvato nu kim, does the sky fall? is the\nearth torn asunder, or the mountain?\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Saya _n_ a was evidently without an authoritative explanation of tana\nyu _g_ a\xc2\xb4. He tries to explain it by 'through the union of you may strength to\nresist be quickly extended.' Wilson: 'May your collective strength be quickly\nexerted.' Benfey takes tana as adverb and leaves out yu _g_ a\xc2\xb4: 'Zu allen\nZeiten, O Furchtbare!--sei im Nu zu uberwalt'gen euch die Macht.' Yu _g_ a\xc2\xb4,\nan instrumental, if used together with another instrumental, becomes in the\nVeda a mere preposition: cf. VII, 43, 5; 95, 4. raya\xc2\xb4 yu _g_ a\xc2\xb4; X, 83, 3.\ntapasa yu _g_ a\xc2\xb4; X, 102, 12. vadhri _n_ a yu _g_ a\xc2\xb4; VII, 32, 20. puram-dhya\nyu _g_ a\xc2\xb4; VI, 56, 2. sakhya yu _g_ a\xc2\xb4; VIII, 68, 9. tva\xc2\xb4 yu _g_ a\xc2\xb4. As to the\nmeaning of tan, see B. R. s. v., where tan in our passage is explained as\ncontinuation. The offspring or race of the Maruts is mentioned again in the\nnext verse.\n\nNote 2. I take nu _k_ it a-dh _r i_she as an abrupt interrogative sentence,\nviz. Can it be defied? Can it be resisted? See V, 87, 2:\n\ntat va _h_ maruta _h_ na a-dh _r i_she _s_ ava _h_.\n\nYour strength, O Maruts, is not to be defied.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Large trees of the forest are called the kings or lords of the forest.\nInstead of pro arata, the Taitt. Br. II, 4, 4, 2, reads pro varata, which Saya\n_n_ a explains by pro, prakarshe _n_ a, avarata dhavata.\n\np. 102\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Prash _t_ i is explained by Saya _n_ a as a sort of yoke in the\nmiddle, when three horses or other animals are harnessed to a car; rohita as a\nkind of red deer. Hence Wilson remarks that the sense may be, 'The red deer\nyoked between them aids to drag the car.' But he adds that the construction of\nthe original is obscure, and apparently rude and ungrammatical. Benfey\ntranslates, 'Sie fuhrt ein flammenrothes Joch,' and remarks against Wilson\nthat Saya _n_ a's definition of prash _t_ i as yoke is right, but that of\nrohita as deer, wrong. If Saya _n_ a's authority is to be invoked at all, one\nmight appeal from Saya _n_ a in this place to Saya _n_ a VIII, 7, 28, where\nprash _t_ i is explained by him either by quick or by pramukhe yu _g_ yamana\n_h_ , harnessed in front. The verse is\n\nyat esham pishati _h_ rathe prash _t_ i _h_ vahati rohita _h_.\n\nWhen the red leader draws or leads their spotted deer in the chariot.\n\nVI, 47, 24. prash _t_ i _h_ is explained as tripada adhara _h_ ; tadvad\nvahantiti prash _t_ ayo\xe0\xa4\xbd _s_ va _h_. In I, 100, 17, prash _t_ ibhi _h_ , as\napplied to men, means friends or supporters, or, as Saya _n_ a explains, par\n_s_ vasthair anyair _ri_ shibhi _h_.\n\nLudwig (IV, ad 25, 8) adds some useful information. He quotes from the comm.\non Taitt. S. I, 7, 8; vamadakshi _n_ ayor a _s_ vayor madhya ishadvayam\nprasarya tayor madhye saptyakhya _g_ ativi _s_ eshopetam a _s_ va _m_ yu _\xc3\xb1_\n_g_ yat. The right horse is said to be the arva, the left va _g_ i, the middle\nsapti _h_. La _t_ yayana II, 7, 23, calls the two side-horses prash _t_ i.\nAccording to Saya _n_ a (Taitt. S. I, 7, 8, p. 1024) prash _t_ i means\noriginally a tripod for holding a pot (see above), and afterwards a chariot\nwith three horses. In that case we should have to translate, the red chariot\nmoves along.\n\nNote 2. Aufrecht derives a _s_ rot from _s_ ru, to shake, without necessity,\nhowever; see Muir's Sanskrit Texts, IV, p. 494.\n\nLudwig also remarks that a _s_ rot might be translated by the earth trembled\nor vibrated. Similar passages occur RV. I, 127, 3. vi _l_ u _k_ it yasya sam-\n_ri_ tau _s_ ruvat vana-iva yat sthiram, at whose approach even what is firm\nand strong\n\np. 103\n\nwill shake, like the forests. Roth translates, the earth yielded, got out of\nyour way.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. Ka _n_ va, the author of the hymn.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. The abhva, fiend, or, as Benfey translates it very happily, Ungethum,\nmay have been sent by the Maruts themselves, or by some mortal. With reference\nto yushmeshita it is said afterwards that the Maruts are to withdraw their\nhelp from him. I have adopted Wilson's and Ludwig's interpretation of vi\nyuyota, with the instrumental.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. The verb dada is the second pers. plur. of the perfect of da, and is\nused here in the sense of to keep, to protect, as is well shown by B. and R.\ns. v. da 4, base dad. Saya _n_ a did not understand the word, and took it for\nan irregular imperative; yet he assigned to the verb the proper sense of to\nkeep, instead of to give. Hence Wilson: 'Uphold the sacrificer Ka _n_ va.'\nBenfey, less correctly, 'Den Ka _n_ va gabt ihr,' as if Ka _n_ va had been the\nhighest gift of the Maruts.\n\nNote 2. The simile, as lightnings go to the rain, is not very telling. It may\nhave been suggested by the idea that the lightnings run about to find the\nrain, or the tertium comparationis may simply be the quickness of lightning.\nWilson: 'As the lightnings bring the rain.' Benfey: '(So schnell) gleichwie\nder Blitz zum Regen kommt.' Lightning precedes the rain, and may therefore be\nrepresented as looking about for the rain. Ludwig proposes some bold\nconjectures. He would change ka _n_ vam to ra _n_ vam, and take the words from\nasamibhi _h_ to ganta as a parenthesis. He translates: 'For nothing imperfect,\nyou highly to be revered Maruts, no, something delightful you gave--(with\nperfect aids, Maruts, come to us)--as lightnings give rain.'\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. Wilson: 'Let loose your anger.' Saya _n_ a: 'Let loose a murderer who\nhates.'\n\np. 104\n\nPari-manyu, which occurs but once in the Rig-veda, corresponds as nearly as\npossible to the Greek \xcf\x80\xce\xb5\xcf\x81\xce\xaf\xce\xb8\xcf\x85\xce\xbc\xce\xbf\xcf\x82. Manyu, like \xce\xb8\xcf\x85\xce\xbc\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x82, means courage, spirit,\nanger; and in the compound parimanyu, as in \xcf\x80\xce\xb5\xcf\x81\xce\xaf\xce\xb8\xcf\x85\xce\xbc\xce\xbf\xcf\x82, the preposition pari\nseems to strengthen the simple notion of the word. That pari is used in that\nsense in later Sanskrit is well known; for instance, in parilaghu, perlevis,\nparikshama, withered away: see Pott, Etymologische Forschungen, second\nedition, vol. i, p. 487. How pari, originally meaning round about, came to\nmean excessive, is difficult to explain with certainty. It may have been,\nbecause what surrounds exceeds, but it may also have been because what is done\nall around a thing is done thoroughly. See Curtius, Grundzuge, fifth edition,\np. 274. Thus we find in the Veda, VIII, 75, 9, pari-dveshas, lit. one who\nhates all around, then a great hater:\n\nma\xc2\xb4 na _h_ \xe2\x80\xa6 pari-dveshasa _h_ a _m_ hati _h_ , urmi _h_ na na\xc2\xb4vam a\xc2\xb4 vadhit.\n\nMay the grasp of the violent hater strike us not, as the wave strikes a ship.\n\nAgain, pari-sp _r i_dh means literally one who strives round about, then an\neager enemy, a rival (fem.):\n\nIX, 53, 1. nudasva ya\xc2\xb4 _h_ pari-sp _r i_dha _h_.\n\nDrive away those who are rivals.\n\nPari-kro _s_ a means originally one who shouts at one from every side, who\nabuses one roundly, then an angry reviler. This word, though not mentioned in\nB. R.'s Dictionary, occurs in\n\nI, 29, 7. sarvam pari-kro _s_ am _g_ ahi.\n\nKill every reviler!\n\nThe same idea which is here expressed by pari-kro _s_ a, is in other places\nexpressed by pari-rap, lit. one who shouts round about, who defies on every\nside, a calumniator, an enemy, one who 'be-rattles.'\n\nII, 23, 3. a\xc2\xb4 vi-ba\xc2\xb4dhya pari-rapa _h_.\n\nHaving struck down the enemies.\n\nII, 23, 14. vi pari-rapa _h_ ardaya.\n\nDestroy the enemies.\n\nIn the same way as the words meaning to hate, to\n\np. 105\n\noppose, to attack, are strengthened by this preposition, which conveys the\nidea of round about, we also find words expressive of love strengthened by the\nsame preposition. Thus from prita _h_ , loved, we have pari-prita _h_ , lit.\nloved all round, then loved very much: I, 190, 6. pari-prita _h_ na mitra _h_\n; cf. X, 27, 12. We also find IX, 72, 1. pari-priya _h_ , those who love fully\nor all around, which may mean great lovers, or surrounding friends.\n\nIn all these cases the intensifying power of pari arises from representing the\naction of the verb as taking place on every side, thoroughly, excessively; but\nin other cases, mentioned by Professor Pott, particularly where this\npreposition is joined to a noun which implies some definite limit, its\nmagnifying power is no doubt due to the fact that what is around, is outside,\nand therefore beyond. Thus in Greek \xcf\x80\xce\xb5\xcf\x81\xce\xaf\xce\xbc\xce\xb5\xcf\x84\xcf\x81\xce\xbf\xcf\x82 expresses the same idea as\n\xe1\xbd\x91\xcf\x80\xe1\xbd\xb3\xcf\x81\xce\xbc\xce\xb5\xcf\x84\xcf\x81\xce\xbf\xcf\x82 (loc. cit. p. 488), but I doubt whether pari ever occurs in that\nsense in Sanskrit compounds.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 64.
