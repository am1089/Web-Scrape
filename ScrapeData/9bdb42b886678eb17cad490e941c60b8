On account of (the same) number being recorded.\n\nThe \xc3\x82tharva _n_ ikas exhibit, with reference to the Self, the following\nmantra, 'Two birds, inseparable friends, cling to the same tree. One of them\neats the sweet fruit, the other looks on without eating' (Mu. Up. III, 1, i).\nThe same mantra is found in the text of the _S_ veta _s_ vataras (IV, 6). The\nKa _th_ as again read, 'There are the two drinking their reward in the world\nof their own works, entered into the cave, dwelling on the highest summit.\nThose who know Brahman call them shade and light, likewise those householders\nwho perform the Tri _n_ a _k_ iketa-sacrifice.'--The doubt here arises whether\nthe two sections introduced by these mantras constitute one vidya or two\nvidyas. Here the purvapakshin maintains that we have to do with two separate\nvidyas, because the texts exhibit certain differences. For the mantra of the\nMu _n_ _d_ aka and _S_ veta _s_ vatara Upanishads represents one bird as\nenjoying and the other as not enjoying; while in the mantra of the Ka _th_ as\n\np. 241\n\nboth are said to enjoy.--As thus the objects of knowledge differ in character,\nthe vidyas themselves must be looked upon as separate.\n\nTo this we make the following reply. The vidya is one only because both\nmantras exhibit the character of the objects of knowledge as one and the same,\nviz. as defined by the number two.--But has not the purvapakshin shown that\nthere exists a certain difference of character?--By no means, we reply. Both\ntexts intimate one and the same matter, viz. the Lord together with the\nindividual soul. In the Mu _n_ _d_ aka-text the clause, 'The other looks on\nwithout eating,' intimates the highest Self which is raised above all desire;\nthe same highest Self forms also the subject of the complementary passage,\n'But when he sees the other Lord contented.' And the Ka _th_ a-text intimates\nthe same highest Self which is raised above all desire; only, as it is\nmentioned together with the enjoying individual soul, it is itself\nmetaphorically spoken of as enjoying; just as we speak of the 'men with the\numbrella,' although only one out of several carries an umbrella. For that in\nthe Ka _th_ a-text also the highest Self forms the general subject-matter we\nhave to conclude from the preceding passage, 'That which thou seest as neither\nthis nor that' (I, 2, 14), and from the complementary passage referring to the\nsame Self, 'Which is a bridge for sacrificers, which is the highest\nimperishable Brahman' (I, 3, 2). All this has been explained at length under\nI, 2, 11. As therefore there is one object of knowledge only, the vidya also\nis one.--Moreover, if we carefully examine the context of the three mantras\nquoted, we observe that they are concerned merely with the knowledge of the\nhighest Self, and that they mention the individual soul not as a new object of\ninstruction but merely to show its identity with the highest Self. And that,\nas far as the knowledge of the highest Self is concerned, the question as to\nthe oneness or separateness of vidyas cannot be even raised, we have already\nshown above. The present Sutra therefore merely aims at a fuller discussion of\nthe matter, the practical outcome of which is that any particulars stated in\none of the texts only have to be supplied in the others also.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[240:1](sbe38176.htm#fr_153) I.e. a sacrifice lasting four days, called _G_\namadagnya, because first offered by _G_ amadagni.
