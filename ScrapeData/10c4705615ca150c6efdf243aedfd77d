VII.\n\nBy what means men are exempted from the authority of Yama, as narrated by\nBhishma to Nakula. Dialogue between Yama and one of his attendants.\nWorshippers of Vishn\xcc\x81u not subject to Yama. How they are to be known.\n\nMAITREYA.--You have indeed related to me, most excellent Brahman, all that I\nasked of you; but I am desirous to hear one thing which you have not touched\non. This universe, composed of seven zones, with its seven subterrestrial\nregions, and seven spheres--this whole egg of Brahma.--is every where swarming\nwith living creatures, large or small, with smaller and smallest, and larger\nand largest; so that there is not the eighth part of an inch in which they do\nnot abound. Now all these are captives in the chains of acts, and at the end\nof their existence become slaves to the power of Yama, by whom they are\nsentenced to painful punishments. Released from these inflictions, they are\nagain born in the condition of gods, men, or the like: and thus living beings,\nas the \xc5\x9aastras apprise us, perpetually revolve. Now the question I have to\nask, and which you are so well able to answer, is, by what acts men may free\nthemselves from subjection to Yama?\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--This question, excellent Muni, was once asked by Nakula 1 of his\ngrandfather Bhishma; and I will repeat to you the reply made by the latter.\n\nBhishma said to the prince, "There formerly came on a visit to me a friend of\nmine, a Brahman, from the Kalinga country, who told me that he had once\nproposed this question to a holy Muni, who retained the recollection of his\nformer births, and by whom what was, and what will be, was accurately told.\nBeing importuned by me, who placed implicit faith in his words, to repeat what\nthat pious personage had imparted to him, he at last communicated it to me;\nand what he related I have never met with elsewhere.\n\np. 287\n\n"Having, then, on one occasion, put to him the same question which you have\nasked, the Kalinga Brahman recalled the story that had been told him by the\nMuni--the great mystery that had been revealed to him by the pious sage, who\nremembered his former existence--a dialogue that occurred between Yama and one\nof his ministers.\n\n"Yama beholding one of his servants with his noose in his hand, whispered to\nhim, and said, \'Keep clear of the worshippers of Madhusudana. I am the lord of\nall men, the Vaishn\xcc\x81avas excepted. I was appointed by Brahma, who is\nreverenced by all the immortals, to restrain mankind, and regulate the\nconsequences of good and evil in the universe. But be who obeys Hari, as his\nspiritual guide, is here independent of me; for Vishn\xcc\x81u is of power to govern\nand control me. As gold is one substance still, however diversified as\nbracelets, tiaras, or earrings, so Hari is one and the same, although modified\nin the forms of gods, animals, and man. As the drops of water, raised by wind\nfrom the earth, sink into the earth again when the wind subsides, so the\nvarieties of gods, men, and animals, which have been detached by the agitation\nof the qualities, are reunited, when that disturbance ceases, with the\neternal. He who through holy knowledge diligently adores the lotus foot of\nthat Hari, who is reverenced by the gods, is released from all the bonds of\nsin; and you must avoid him as you would avoid fire fed with oil.\'\n\n"Having heard these injunctions of Yama, the messenger addressed the lord of\nrighteousness, and said, \'Tell me, master, how am I to distinguish the\nworshipper of Hari, who is the protector of all beings?\' Yama replied, \'You\nare to consider the worshipper of Vishn\xcc\x81u, him who never deviates from the\nduties prescribed to his caste; who looks with equal indifference upon friend\nor enemy; who takes,; nothing (that is not his own), nor injures any being.\nKnow that person of unblemished mind to be a worshipper of Vishn\xcc\x81u. Know him\nto be a devout worshipper of Hari, who has placed Janarddana in his pure mind,\nwhich has been freed from fascination, and whose soul is undefiled by the soil\nof the Kali age. Know that excellent man to be a worshipper of Vishn\xcc\x81u, who,\nlooking upon gold in secret, holds that which is another\'s wealth but as\ngrass, and devotes all his thoughts to the lord. Pure is he as a mountain\n\np. 288\n\nof clear crystal; for how can Vishn\xcc\x81u abide in the hearts of men with malice\nand envy, and other evil passions? the glowing heat of fire abides not in a\ncluster of the cooling rays of the moon. He who lives pure in thought, free\nfrom malice, contented, leading a holy life, feeling tenderness for all\ncreatures, speaking wisely and kindly, humble and sincere, has Vasudeva ever\npresent in his heart. As the young Sal-tree by its beauty declares the\nexcellence of the juices which it has imbibed from the earth, so when the\neternal has taken up his abode in the bosom of any one, that man is lovely\namidst the beings of this world. Depart, my servant, quickly from those men\nwhose sins have been dispersed by moral and religious merit 2, whose minds are\ndaily dedicated to the imperceptible deity, and who are exempt from pride,\nuncharitableness, and malice. In the heart in which the divine Hari, who is\nwithout beginning or end, abides, armed with a sword, a shell, and a mace, sin\ncannot remain; for it cannot coexist with that which destroys it, as darkness\ncannot continue in the world when the sun is shining. The eternal makes not\nhis abode in the heart of that man who covets another\'s wealth, who injures\nliving creatures, who speaks harshness and untruth, who is proud of his\niniquity, and whose mind is evil. Janarddana occupies not his thoughts who\nenvies another\'s prosperity, who calumniates the virtuous, who never\nsacrifices nor bestows gifts upon the pious, who is blinded by the property of\ndarkness. That vile wretch is no worshipper of Vishn\xcc\x81u, who through avarice is\nunkind to his nearest friends and relations, to his wife, children, parents,\nand dependants. The brute-like man whose thoughts are evil, who is addicted to\nunrighteous acts, who ever seeks the society of the wicked, and suffers no day\nto pass without the perpetration of crime, is no worshipper of Vasudeva. Do\nyou proceed afar off from those in whose hearts Ananta is enshrined;\n\np. 289\n\nfrom him whose sanctified understanding conceives the supreme male and ruler,\nVasudeva, as one with his votary, and with all this world. Avoid those holy\npersons who are constantly invoking the lotus-eyed Vasudeva, Vishn\xcc\x81u, the\nsupporter of the earth, the immortal wielder of the discus and the shell, the\nasylum of the world. Come not into the sight of him in whose heart the\nimperishable soul resides, for he is defended from my power by the discus of\nhis deity: he is designed for another world (for the heaven of Vishn\xcc\x81u).\'\n\n"\'Such,\' said the Kalinga Brahman, \'were the instructions communicated by the\ndeity of justice, the son of the sun, to his servants, as they were repeated\nto me by that holy personage, and as I have related them to you, chief of the\nhouse of Kuru\' (Bhishma). So also, Nakula, I have faithfully communicated to\nyou all I heard from my pious friend, when he came from his country of Kalinga\nto visit me. I have thus explained to you, as was fitting, that there is no\nprotection in the ocean of the world except Vishn\xcc\x81u; and that the servants and\nministers of Yama, the king of the dead himself, and his tortures, are all\nunavailing against one who places his reliance on that divinity."\n\nI have thus, resumed Para\xc5\x9bara, related to you what you wished to hear, and\nwhat was said by the son of Vivaswat 3. What else do you wish to hear?\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[286:1](vp081.htm#fr_814) Nakula is one of the Pan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ava princes, and\nconsequently grand-nephew, not grandson, of Bhishma: he is great grandson of\nPara\xc5\x9bara; and it is rather an anomaly for the latter to cite a conversation in\nwhich Nakula formerly bore a part.\n\n[288:2](vp081.htm#fr_815) Or Yama and Niyama. The duties intended by these\nterms are variously enumerated. The commentator on the text specifics under\nthe first head, absence of violence or cruelty to other beings (Ahinsa),\nhonesty (Asteya), truth (Satya), chastity (Brahmacharyya), and\ndisinterestedness or non-acceptance of gifts (Aparigraha). Under Niyama are\ncomprehended purity (\xc5\x9aaucha), contentment (Santosha), devotion (Tapas), study\nof the Vedas (Swadhyaya), and adoration of the supreme (\xc3\x8d\xc5\x9bwara-pran\xcc\x81idhana).\n\n[289:3](vp081.htm#fr_816) Or Vaivaswata.
