As against this view the Buddhist asks:\n\n1\\. If, as in svapna, the whole universe exists within even in jagrat, (then\ntell me), does anything appear to any one in sushupti? Who persists there as a\nconscious entity?\n\nThe Nihilist means that there is no conscious entity present in sushupti; that\nthere is no entity whatever conscious of anything in sushupti. Therefore, no\neternal Atman exists, such as the one spoken of by Vedantins. The Buddhistic\nNihilist states his doctrine as follows:\n\n2\\. Everything is momentary and void; and everything self-defined.\n\np. 116\n\nEverything in the universe including the Atman, exists only for one instant;\nand it did not exist before, and will not exist after, that instant.\n\nEverything is self-defined, is cognised by itself; there can be no cogniser\ndistinct from the object cognised.\n\nNow, there is a school of Buddhists which maintains that the external world\nexists as well as the internal world: that the objective existence is as real\nas the subjective. They hold that the subjective existence is made up of five\nskandhas or "forms of mundane [consciousness](errata.htm#16)." Their doctrine\nis stated as follows:\n\nEarth, water, fire, and air are mere aggregates of paramanus or atoms.\n\nThey are mere groups of the four kinds of atoms. They have no attributes of\ntheir own distinct from those of the atoms of which they are made; whereas the\nVaiseshikas maintain that they have. Nor are they,--as the Sankhyas, the\nParinamavadins say--different forms evolved from a previously existing cause,\ncoming into manifestation one after another, though in substance one and the\nsame with the cause. Such is the nature of the external world comprising\nelements of matter and material objects. As to the inner world:\n\np. 117\n\n3\\. Human and other bodies are mere aggregates of the five skandhas or bundles\nof conscious states; and these skandhas are Rupa, Vijnana, Samjna, Samskara,\nand Vedana.\n\n4\\. The _Rupas_ comprise sense-objects and sense-organs, in so far as they are\nrepresented (in the mind).\n\nIt is their subjective representations, _i.e._. our ideas of the sense-objects\nand sense-organs, which go to form the Rupa-skandha, one of the five skandhas\nor "forms of consciousness." The objects themselves as well as the sense-\norgans belong, no doubt, to the external world.\n\nThe mere cognition of sense-objects and sense-organs is called _Vijnana-\nskandha_.\n\np. 118\n\n5-7\\. The _Samjn a-skandha_ is represented by the Saugatas (Buddhists) to\nconsist of five parts, viz., name, quality, act, species and the idea of a\ncomposite whole.\n\nThe _name_ of the cow is \'cow\'; the specific attributes of a cow abiding in\nall cows constitutes the _species:_ whiteness, etc., are the\n[_qualities_](errata.htm#17) of the cow; going, etc., are her _acts;_ the\nhorned animal, the four-footed animal, the tailed animal,--each of these is an\nidea of a _composite whole_. Thus five-fold is the Samjna-skandha said to be.\n\n8\\. Attachment and the like, as also virtue and sin, are said to comprise the\n_Samsk ara-skandha_, the bundle of tendencies.\n\np. 119\n\n[paragraph continues] Pleasure, pain, and moksha [constitute](errata.htm#18)\nthe _Vedan a-skandha_.\n\n_Moksha_ is a continuous stream of pure states of consciousness, unmixed with\nalien ideas such as those of sense-objects. Some read _Moha_ for _Moksha_ ,\n_Moha_ meaning quite the reverse: it is a continuous stream of conscious\nstates perplexed with ideas of external objects and the like.\n\n9\\. Beyond the five skandhas, there is no other entity such as Atman. There is\nno Isvara, no Maker. The universe is self-made.\n\nThere is no persisting conscious entity within, beyond the skandhas made of\nthese fleeting constituents. There is no Isvara, or Maker, combining the\nvarious elements of the universe with one another, guiding and regulating\ntheir orderly evolution. The universe is self-begotten, self-reliant and self-\nregulated. No intelligent operator is necessary.\n\np. 120\n\n10\\. It is born of the fleeting (kshanika) skandhas and paramanus. From one\nmomentary existence alone comes the next momentary existence.\n\nIsvara cannot create without the materials which He has to elaborate in the\nform of a universe. Neither can He create a universe out of materials which do\nnot possess the potentialities of the universe inherent in them. Isvara is,\nmoreover, said to be immutable in Himself, whereas the whole universe is\nmobile, changing from moment to moment; so that it is unnecessary and even\nopposed to experience to postulate the existence of Isvara, as conceived by\nthe Vedantin.\n\n11\\. From the previous cognition itself arises the subsequent cognition. The\ncognition that this is the same as that is an illusion, like the cognition\nthat this flame is the same as that ( _i.e._ , the previous) one.\n\nAs in the case of flame, the illusion is caused by a succession of things of\nthe same sort, each of which exists only for one moment; so that\n_pratyabhijna_ , the consciousness which refers to\n\np. 121\n\nthe continuous existence of one and the same thing, is a mere illusion.\n\n12\\. The existence of the ego amidst non-ego is a mere imagination of those\nwho are deluded by the idea that it exists and shines,--it being no object to\nbe sought or avoided. Does akasa ever shine?\n\nThe Buddhistic metaphysicians regard akasa as a non-entity, because it is no\nobject which one endeavours to secure or to avoid. Likewise, since the idea of\nthe ego amidst the non-ego as _existing_ and _shining_ leads to no human\nendeavour to secure or avoid it, its _existence_ and the _light_ with which it\nis said to shine are non-entities.\n\n#### Refutation of Nihilism.\n\n13\\. The Buddhistic doctrinaire thus speaking is silenced (in the sixth stanza\nof the Hymn).\n\np. 122\n\nThe meaning of the stanza may be explained at follows:--\n\nIf the cause of the universe be void (Sunya), a non-entity, the universe\nitself cannot be as we find it.\n\n14\\. Who ever says that the pot is a nonentity, or that the cloth is a non-\nentity?\n\nThe Buddhist says that there was nothing before the universe came into being,\n--that the universe was made out of nothing. But in our experience, whatever\neffect comes out of a thing as the cause, it is always conceived to be made up\nof that cause, and the cause is resorted to as productive of the effect. Thus\na gold ring is always conceived to be made up of gold, and is resorted to as\nserving the purposes of gold. If the universe had been made out of nothing, we\nwould look upon it as nothing and neglect it altogether as such. The\nNihilistic theory, therefore, ought to be discarded by those who demand proof\nfor things presented to their belief.\n\nThe Nihilist may perhaps say that, though the universe is really a non-entity,\nyet, owing to illusion, our conduct in life may go on as if the universe were\nreal. To this the Vedantin replies as follows:\n\np. 123\n\n14\\. If the universe were a non-entity, it would never have appeared, any more\nthan a man\'s horn.\n\n15\\. To what would one resort seeking to have a thing? What would one cast\naside who is afflicted with a burden? Who is there to command or prohibit,\nwhen one\'s own self is a non-entity?\n\n16\\. This whole universe, therefore, having no cause for its existence, may\ncome to an end.\n\nA non-entity cannot even be a subject of illusion any more than a man\'s horn.\n\n#### Refutation of the doctrine of the five Skandhas.\n\n16\\. Now as to the theory that there exists none who combines and elaborates\nthe skandhas and paramanus.\n\np. 124\n\n17\\. A combination cannot occur without a cause ( _i.e._ , the combiner). A\npot, a cloth, and the like are inert.\n\nThey are insentient and cannot, therefore, combine together by\n[themselves](errata.htm#19). Thread, for instance, cannot, by itself, form a\ncloth without a weaver handling it. Further, the theory that the Ego is\nmomentary leads to many absurdities.\n\n"I shall become an Exalted Being," thus thinks the deluded (Buddhist)\n\n18\\. For what purpose does the Buddhist observe vows while denying the\nexistence of Atman?\n\n#### Pratyabhijna is no illusion.\n\nIf pratyabhijna, the recognition of identity, be an illusion, why should one\neat or do any such thing?\n\np. 125\n\n19\\. It is only in the belief that to-day food will satisfy the craving as\nyesterday\'s food did, that even a child resorts to eating.\n\nThis would be impossible if one and the same individual were not the subject\nof the two days\' experiences.\n\n#### Atman\'s continuous Existence.\n\n20\\. As affording space, Akasa has a purpose to serve. So also, as the doer\nand the cogniser, Atman has a purpose to serve.\n\nThus, the contention that a continuous Atman, like akasa, is a non-entity as\nserving no purpose, falls to the ground. Akasa is not a non-entity, not a mere\nnegative state of being unoccupied; it is, on the other hand, a diffused\nprinciple affording space for creatures to exist and move. So, having a\npurpose to serve as the doer and the knower, Atman\'s continuous existence\ncannot be denied.\n\np. 126\n\n21\\. Even during sushupti, Atman is endued with being, consciousness, and\nbliss, because self-identity is recognise.; in the consciousness "I slept\nhappy."\n\nThe Buddhist cannot consistently regard this consciousness of self-identity as\na mere illusion based on similarity; for, according to his theory, there is no\nconscious entity persisting so long as to perceive a similarity between two\nthings occurring in two different moments.\n\n22\\. The expression "Atman is recognised " is in the reflexive passive voice.\nBeing self-luminous, Atman knows Himself by Himself.\n\nThe expression "Atman is recognised." is in the reflexive\n[passive](errata.htm#20) voice, and it is equivalent to "Atman recognises\nHimself" in the active voice. Thus, the expression does not mean that Atman is\nperceived by another and so forms an object of consciousness like external\nobjects. The use of the given expression does not, therefore, detract from the\nself-luminousness of Atman.\n\np. 127\n\n23\\. Deluded as He is by Maya in sushupti, He then appears as inert and\nunconscious; He shines as non-luminous and self-luminous.\n\nIn so far as He is not manifested in any special form of cognition, Atman\nshines as non-luminous. As His inherent consciousness never fails, He appears\nas self-luminous.\n\n24\\. From the physical body and other upadhis which are all unconscious in\nthemselves, He is clearly distinguished as their Lord.\n\nThe upadhis are insentient. They are unconscious of themselves and of their\nown or others\' functions; whereas Atman, who is conscious of His own self-\nidentity, illumines all thus: I, who then saw, now hear, now taste, now speak,\nnow go, and so on. Thus Atman is clearly distinguishable from other things as\nthe Lord of them all, as one to whom all else is subservient, subserving His\ninterests and glory as it were.\n\np. 128\n\nThis verily is the stupefying power of the Mighty Lord\'s Maya.\n\n25\\. Removal of this illusion from the cognisers is spoken of as moksha.\n\nMaya conceals the true nature of Atman. That being removed, the whole samsara\nvanishes away. It is this Maya which has deluded the Buddhists, and they have\ntherefore come to argue against the existence of Atman.\n\n#### Atman\'s true nature.\n\nFree from the three states (avasthas), tainted by no evil passion or thought;\n\n26\\. The One Existence, which is like unto the ishika reed, like unto the\nnyagrodha (banyan) seed, like unto the inside stalk of the plantain trunk\nstripped off its outer and inner sheaths;\n\nThe ishika which is the slender fine stalk of munja grass, is intended to\nillustrate the homogeneity of Atman. The particle of the nyagrodha\n\np. 129\n\nseed serves to illustrate the truth that Atman is a very subtle principle\nwhence the mighty universe is evolved ( _vide_ Chhandogya-Upanishad, 6-12).\nThe plaintain stalk shows that Atman is to be sought for in the innermost\nrecesses of human nature.\n\n27\\. Atman is said to be the Paramesvara Himself who is partless, changeless,\nunmanifested, stainless, all-pervading, and free (from all upadhis);\n\n28- 29. He from whom all words recede; in whom manas itself dissolves; in whom\nall beings and worlds merge into one, as also all principles, as rivers merge\nin the ocean. To him who sees this unity, where is grief and where is\ndelusion?" ( _Is avasyopanishad_, 7).\n\np. 130\n\n30\\. Though differentiated as designations and the designated, yet by\nelimination of the physical body, etc., this one, the Ego, can be the\nUndifferentiated.\n\n31\\. "Quite non-existent shall the man of knowledge be if he should know that\nBrahman is not. If he should know that Brahman is, then they say he is." (\n_Taittiriya-Upanishad_ , 2-6.)\n\n32\\. Thus ends the sixth chapter in brief, in the work called Manasollasa,\nwhich expounds the meaning of the Hymn to the Blessed Dakshinamurti.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VII.
