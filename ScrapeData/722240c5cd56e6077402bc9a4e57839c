They\nwere all good girls; but the youngest, named Balna,  1 was more clever than\nthe rest. The Rajah's wife died when they were quite little children, so these\nseven poor Princesses were left with no mother to take care of them.\n\nThe Rajah's daughters took it by turns to cook their father's dinner every\nday,  2 whilst he was absent deliberating with his Ministers on the affairs of\nthe nation.\n\nAbout this time the Prudhan  3 died, leaving a widow and one daughter; and\nevery day, every day, when the seven Princesses were preparing their father's\ndinner, the Prudhan's widow and daughter would come and beg for a little fire\nfrom the hearth. Then Balna used to say to her sisters, 'Send that woman away;\nsend her away. Let her get the fire at her own house. What does shc want with\nours? If we allow her to come here we shall suffer for it some day.' But the\nother sisters would answer, 'Be quiet Balna; why must you always be\nquarrelling with this pooi woman? Let her take some fire if she likes.' Then\nthe Prudhan's widow used to go to the hearth and take a few sticks from it and\nwhilst no one was looking, she would quickly throw some mud into the midst of\nthe dishes which were being prepared fo the Rajah's dinner.\n\nNow the Rajah was very fond of his daughters. Ever since their mother's death\nthey had cooked his dinner with their own hands, in order to avoid the danger\nof his being poisoned by his enemies. So, when he found the mud mixed up with\nhis dinner, he thought it must arise from their carelessness, as it appeared\nimprobable that any one should have put mud there on purpose; but being very\nkind he did not like to reprove them for it, although this spoiling of the\ncurrie was repeated many successive days.\n\nAt last, one day, he determined to hide, and watch his daughters cooking, and\nsee how it all happened; so he went into the next room, and watched them\nthrough a hole in the wall.\n\nThere he saw his seven daughters carefully washing the rice and preparing the\ncurrie, and as each dish was completed the) put it by the fire ready to be\ncooked. Next he noticed the Prudhan's widow come to the door, and beg for a\nfew sticks fron the fire to cook her dinner with. Balna turned to her angrily\nand said, 'Why don't you keep fuel in your own house, and no. come here every\nday and take ours?--Sisters, don't give this woman any more wood; let her buy\nit for herself.'\n\nThen the eldest sister answered, 'Balna, let the poor woman take the wood and\nthe fire; she does us no harm.' But Balm replied, 'If you let her come here so\noften, may be she will do w some harm, and make us sorry for it some day.'\n\nThe Rajah then saw the Prudhan's widow go to the place where all his dinner\nwas nicely prepared, and, as she took the wood, she threw a little mud into\neach of the dishes.\n\nAt this he was very angry, and sent to have the woman seized and brought\nbefore him. But when the widow came, she told him she had played this trick\nbecause she wanted to gain an audience with him; and she spoke so cleverly,\nand pleased him so well with her cunning words, that instead of punishing her,\nthe Rajah married her, and made her his Ranee, and she and her daughter came\nto live in the palace.\n\nNow the new Ranee hated the seven poor Princesses, and wanted to get them, if\npossible, out of the way, in order that her daughter might have all their\nriches, and live in the palace as Princess in their place; and instead of\nbeing grateful to them for their kindness to her she did all she could to make\nthem miserable. She gave them nothing but bread to eat, and very little of\nthat, and very little water to drink; so these seven poor little Princesses,\nwho had been accustomed to have everything comfortable about them, and good\nfood and good clothes all their lives long, were very miserable and unhappy;\nand they used to go out every day and sit by their dead mother's tomb and cry\n--and say--'Oh mother, mother! cannot you see your poor children, how unhappy\nwe are, and how we are starved by our cruel stepmother?'\n\nOne day, whilst they were thus sobbing and crying, lo and behold! a beautiful\npomelo tree  4 grew up out of the grave, covered with fresh ripe pomeloes, and\nthe children satisfied their hunger by eating some of the fruit, and every day\nafter this, instead of trying to eat the, bad dinner their stepmother provided\nfor them, they used to go out to their mother's grave and eat the pomeloes\nwhich grew there on the beautiful tree.\n\nThen the Ranee said to her daughter, 'I cannot tell how it is, every day those\nseven girls say they don't want any dinner, and won't eat any; and yet they\nnever grow thin nor look ill; they look better than you do. I cannot tell how\nit is '--and she bade her watch the seven Princesses, and see if any one gave\nthem anything to eat.\n\nSo next day when the Princesses went to their mother's grave, and were eating\nthe beautiful pomeloes, the Prudhan's daughter followed them, and saw them\ngathering the fruit.\n\nThen Balna said to her sisters, 'Do you not see that girl watching us? Let us\ndrive her away, or hide the pomeloes, else she will go and tell her mother all\nabout it, and that will be very bad for us.'\n\nBut the other sisters said, 'Oh no, do not be unkind, Balna. The girl would\nnever be so cruel as to tell her mother. Let us rather invite her to come and\nhave some of the fruit,'--and, calling her to them, they gave her one of the\npomeloes.\n\nNo sooner had she eaten it, however, than the Prudhan's daughter went home and\nsaid to her mother, 'I do not wonder the seven Princesses will not eat the\ndinner you prepare for them, for by their mother's grave there grows a\nbeautiful pomelo tree, and they go there every day and eat the pomeloes. I ate\none, and it was the nicest I have ever tasted.'\n\nThe cruel Ranee was much vexed at hearing this, and all next day she stayed in\nher room, and told the Rajah that she had a very bad headache. The Rajah was\ndeeply grieved, and said to his wife, 'What can I do for you?' She answered,\n'There is only one thing that will make my headache well. By your dead wife's\ntomb there grows a fine pomelo tree; you must bring that here, and boil it,\nroot and branch, and put a little of the water in which it has been boiled on\nmy forehead, and that will cure my headache.' So the Rajah sent his servants,\nand had the beautiful pomelo tree pulled up by the roots, and did as the Ranee\ndesired; and when some of the water in which it had been boiled was put on her\nforehead, she said her headache was gone and she felt quite well.\n\nNext day, when the seven Princesses went as usual to the grave of their\nmother, the pomelo tree had disappeared. Then they all began to cry very\nbitterly.\n\nNow there was by the Ranee's tomb a small tank, and, as they were crying, they\nsaw that the tank was filled with a rich cream-like substance, which quickly\nhardened into a thick white cake. At seeing this all the Princesses were very\nglad, and they ate some of the cake, and liked it; and next day the same thing\nhappened, and so it went on for many days. Every morning the Princesses went\nto their mother's grave, and found the little tank filled with the nourishing\ncream-like cake. Then the cruel step-mother said to her daughter,--' I cannot\ntell how it is, I have had the pomelo tree which used to grow by the Ranee's\ngrave destroyed, and yet the Princesses grow no thinner, nor look more sad,\nthough they never eat the dinner I give them. I cannot tell how it is!'\n\nAnd her daughter said, 'I will watch.'\n\nNext day while the Princesses were eating the cream cake, who should come by\nbut their stepmother's daughter! Balna saw her first, and said, 'See, sisters,\nthere comes that girl again. Let us sit round the edge of the tank and not\nallow her to see it, for if we give her some of our cake, she will go and tell\nher mother; and that will be very unfortunate for us.'\n\nThe other sisters, however, thought Balna unnecessarily suspicious, and\ninstead of following her advice, they gave the Prudhan's daughter some of the\ncake, and she went home and told her mother all about it.\n\nThe Ranee, on hearing how well the Princesses fared, was exceedingly angry,\nand sent her servants to pull down the dead Ranee's tomb, and fill the little\ntank with the ruins. And not content with this, she next day pretended to be\nvery, very ill--in fact, at the point of death,--and when the Rajah was much\ngrieved, and asked her whether it was in his power to procure her any remedy,\nshe said to him, 'Only one thing can save my life, but I know you will not do\nit.' He replied, 'Yes, whatever it is, I will do it.' She then said, 'To save\nmy life, you must kill the seven daughters of your first wife, and put some of\ntheir blood on my forehead and on the palms of my hands, and their death will\nbe my life.' At these words the Rajah was very sorrowful; but because he\nfeared to break his word, he went out with a heavy heart to find his\ndaughters.\n\nHe found them crying by the ruins of their mother's grave.\n\nThen, feeling he could not kill them, the Rajah spoke kindly to them, and told\nthem to come out into the jungle with him; and there he made a fire and cooked\nsome rice, and gave it to them. But in the afternoon, it being very hot, the\nseven Princesses all fell asleep, and when he saw they were fast asleep, the\nRajah, their father, stole away and left them (for he feared his wife), saying\nto himself, 'It is better my poor daughters should die here, than be killed by\ntheir stepmother.'\n\nHe then shot a deer, and, returning home, put some of its blood on the\nforehead and hands of the Ranee, and she thought then that he had really\nkilled the Princesses, and said she felt quite well.\n\nMeantime the seven Princesses awoke, and when they found themselves all alone\nin the thick jungle they were much frightened, and began to call out as loud\nas they could, in hopes of making their father hear; but he was by that time\nfar away, and would not have been able to hear them even had their voices been\nas loud as thunder.\n\nIt so happened that this very day the seven young Sons of a neighbouring Rajah\nchanced to be hunting in that same jungle, and as they were returning home,\nafter the day's sport was over, the youngest Prince said to his brothers,\n'Stop, I think I hear some one crying and calling out. Do you not hear voices?\nLet us go in the direction of the sound, and find out what it is.'\n\nSo the seven Princes rode through the wood until they came to the place where\nthe seven Princesses sat crying and wringing their hands. At the sight of them\nthe young Princes were very much astonished, and still more so on learning\ntheir story: and they settled that each should take one of these poor forlorn\nladies home with him, and marry her.\n\nSo the first and eldest Prince took the eldest Princess home with him, and\nmarried her;\n\nAnd the second took the second;\n\nAnd the third took the third;\n\nAnd the fourth took the fourth;\n\nAnd the fifth took the fifth;\n\nAnd the sixth took the sixth;\n\nAnd the seventh, and handsomest of all, took the beautiful Balna.\n\nAnd when they got to their own land, there was great rejoicing throughout the\nkingdom, at the marriage of the seven young Princes to seven such beautiful\nPrincesses.\n\nAbout a year after this Balna had a little son, and his uncles and aunts were\nso fond of the boy that it was as if he had seven fathers and seven mothers.\nNone of the other Princes and Princesses had any children, so the son of the\nseventh Prince and Balna was acknowledged their heir by all the rest.\n\nThey had thus lived very happily for some time, when one fine day the seventh\nPrince (Balna's husband) said he would go out hunting, and away he went; and\nthey waited long for him, but he never came back.\n\nThen his six brothers said they would go and see what had become of him; and\nthey went away, but they also did not return.\n\nAnd the seven Princesses grieved very much, for they feared that their kind\nhusbands must have been killed.\n\nOne day, not long after this happened, as Balna was rocking her baby's cradle,\nand whilst her sisters were working in the room below, there came to the\npalace-door a man in a long black dress, who said that he was a Fakeer, and\ncame to beg. The servants said to him, 'You cannot go into the palace--the\nRajah's sons have all gone away; we think they must be dead, and their widows\ncannot be interrupted by your begging.' But he said, 'I am a holy man, you\nmust let me in.' Then the stupid servants let him walk through the palace, but\nthey did not know that this was no Fakeer, but a wicked Magician named\nPunchkin.\n\nPunchkin Fakeer wandered through the palace, and saw many beautiful things\nthere, till at last he reached the room where Balna sat singing beside her\nlittle boy's cradle. The Magician thought her more beautiful than all the\nother beautiful things he had seen, insomuch, that he asked her to go home\nwith him and to marry him. But she said, 'My husband, I fear, is dead, but my\nlittle boy is still quite young; I will stay here and teach him to grow up a\nclever man, and when he is grown up he shall go out into the world, and try\nand learn tidings of his father. Heaven forbid that I should ever leave him,\nor marry you!' At these words the Magician was very angry, and turned her into\na little black dog, and led her away, saying, 'Since you will not come with me\nof your own free will, I will make you.' So the poor Princess was dragged\naway, without any power of effecting an escape, or of letting her sisters know\nwhat had become of her. As Punchkin passed through the palace-gate the\nservants said to him, 'Where did you get that pretty little dog?' And he\nanswered, 'One of the Princesses gave it to me as a present.' At hearing which\nthey let him go without further questioning.\n\nSoon after this, the six elder Princesses heard the little baby, their nephew,\nbegin to cry, and when they went upstairs they were much surprised to find him\nall alone, and Balna nowhere to be seen. Then they questioned the servants,\nand when they heard of the Fakeer and the little black dog, they guessed what\nhad happened, and sent in every direction seeking them, but neither the Fakeer\nnor the dog was to be found. What could six poor women do? They gave up all\nhopes of ever seeing their kind husbands, and their sister, and her husband,\nagain, and devoted themselves thenceforward to teaching and taking care of\ntheir little nephew.\n\nThus time went on, till Balna's son was fourteen years old. Then, one day, his\naunts told him the history of the family; and no sooner did he hear it, than\nhe was seized with a great desire to go in search of his father and mother and\nuncles, and if he could find them alive to bring them home again. His aunts,\non learning his determination, were much alarmed, and tried to dissuade him,\nsaying, 'We have lost our husbands, and our sister, and her husband, and you\nare now our sole hope; if you go away, what shall we do?' But he replied, 'I\npray you not to be discouraged; I will return soon, and if it is possible\nbring my father and mother and uncles with me.' So he set out on his travels;\nbut for some months he could learn nothing to help him in his search.\n\nAt last, after he had journeyed many hundreds of weary miles, and become\nalmost hopeless of ever hearing anything further of his parents, he one day\ncame to a country that seemed full of stones, and rocks, and trees, and there\nhe saw a large palace, with a high tower, hard by which was a Malee's little\nhouse.\n\nAs he was looking about, the Malee's wife saw him, and ran out of the house\nand said, 'My dear boy, who are you that dare venture to this dangerous\nplace?' He answered, 'I am a Rajah's son, and I come in search of my father,\nand my uncles, and my mother whom a wicked enchanter bewitched.' Then the\nMalee's wife said, 'This country and this palace belong to a great enchanter;\nhe is all-powerful, and if any one displeases him, he can turn them into\nstones and trees. All the rocks and trees you see here were living people\nonce, and the Magician turned them to what they now are. Some time ago a\nRajah's son came here, and shortly afterwards came his six brothers, and they\nwere all turned into stones and trees; and these are not the only unfortunate\nones, for up in that tower lives a beautiful Princess, whom the Magician has\nkept prisoner there for twelve years, because she hates him and will not marry\nhim.'\n\nThen the little Prince thought, 'These must be my parents and my uncles. I\nhave found what I seek at last.' So he told his story to the Malee's wife, and\nbegged her to help him to remain in that place a while and inquire further\nconcerning tile unhappy people she mentioned; and she promised to befriend\nhim, and advised his disguising himself lest the Magician should see him, and\nturn him likewise into stone. To this the Prince agreed. So the Malee's wife\ndressed him up in a saree, and pretended that he was her daughter.\n\nOne day, not long after this, as the Magician was walking in his garden, he\nsaw the little girl (as he thought) playing about, and asked her who she was.\nShe told him she was the Malee's daughter, and the Magician said, 'You are a\npretty little girl, and to-morrow you shall take a present of flowers from me\nto the beautiful lady who lives in the tower.'\n\nThe young Prince was much delighted at hearing this, and went immediately to\ninform the Malee's wife; after consultation with whom he determined that it\nwould be more safe for him to retain his disguise, and trust to the chance of\na favourable opportunity for establishing some communication with his mother,\nif it were indeed she.\n\nNow it happened that at Balna's marriage her husband had given her a small\ngold ring on which her name was engraved, and she had put it on her little\nson's finger when he was a baby, and afterwards when he was older his aunts\nhad had it enlarged for him, so that he was still able to wear it. The Malee's\nwife advised him to fasten the well-known treasure to one of the bouquets he\npresented to his mother, and trust to her recognising it. This was not to be\ndone without difficulty, as such a strict watch was kept over the poor\nPrincess (for fear of her ever establishing communication with her friends),\nthat though the supposed Malee's daughter was permitted to take her flowers\nevery day, the Magician or one of his slaves was always in the room at the\ntime. At last, one day, however, opportunity favoured him, and when no one was\nlooking, the boy tied the ring to a nosegay, and threw it at Balna's feet. It\nfell with a clang on the floor, and Balna, looking to see what made the\nstrange sound, found the little ring tied to the flowers. On recognising it,\nshe at once believed the story her son told her of his long search, and begged\nhim to advise her as to what she had better do; at the same time entreating\nhim on no account to endanger his life by trying to rescue her. She told him\nthat, for twelve long years, the Magician had kept her shut up in the tower\nbecause she refused to marry him, and she was so closely guarded that she saw\nno hope of release.\n\nNow Balna's son was a bright, clever boy, so he said, 'Do not fear, dear\nmother; the first thing to do is to discover how far the Magician's power\nextends, in order that we may be able to liberate my father and uncles, whom\nhe has imprisoned in the form of rocks and trees. You have spoken to him\nangrily for twelve long years; now rather speak kindly. Tell him you have\ngiven up all hopes of again seeing the husband you have so long mourned; and\nsay you are willing to marry him. Then endeavour to find out what his power\nconsists in, and whether he is immortal, or can be put to death.'\n\nBalna determined to take her son's advice, and the next day sent for Punchkin,\nand spoke to him as had been suggested.\n\nThe Magician, greatly delighted, begged her to allow the wedding to take place\nas soon as possible.\n\nBut she told him that before she married him he must allow her a little more\ntime, in which she might make his acquaintance;--and that, after being enemies\nso long, their friendship could but strengthen by degrees. 'And do tell me,'\nshe said, 'are you quite immortal? Can death never touch you? And are you too\ngreat an enchanter ever to feel human suffering?'\n\n'Why do you ask?' said he.\n\n'Because,' she replied, 'if I am to be your wife, I would fain know all about\nyou, in order, if any calamity threatens you, to overcome, or if possible to\navert it.'\n\n'It is true,' he said, 'that I am not as others. Far, far away, hundreds of\nthousands of miles from this, there lies a desolate country covered with thick\njungle. In the midst of the jungle grows a circle of palm trees, and in the\ncentre of the circle stand six chattees full of water, piled one above\nanother: below the sixth chattee is a small cage which contains a little green\nparrot;--on the life of the parrot depends my life;---and if the parrot is\nkilled I must die. It is, however,' he added, 'impossible that the parrot\nshould sustain any injury, both on account of the inaccessibility of the\ncountry, and because, by my appointment, many thousand genii surround the palm\ntrees, and kill all who approach the place.'\n\nBalna told her son what Punchkin had said; but at the same time implored him\nto give up all idea of getting the parrot.\n\nThe Prince, however, replied, 'Mother, unless I can get hold of that parrot,\nyou, and my father, and uncles, cannot be liberated; be not afraid, I will\nshortly return. Do you, meantime, keep the Magician in good humour--still\nputting off your marriage with him on various pretexts; and before he finds\nout the cause of delay, I will be here.' So saying, he went away.\n\nMany, many weary miles did he travel, till at last he came to a thick jungle;\nand, being very tired, sat down under a tree and fell asleep. He was awakened\nby a soft rustling sound; and looking about him, saw a large serpent which was\nmaking its way to an eagle's nest built in the tree under which he lay; and in\nthe nest were two young eagles. The Prince seeing the danger of the young\nbirds, drew his sword, and killed the serpent; at the same moment a rushing\nsound was heard in the air, and the two old eagles, who had been out hunting\nfor food for their young ones, returned. They quickly saw the dead serpent and\nthe young Prince standing over it; and the old mother eagle said to him, 'Dear\nboy, for many years all our young ones have been devoured by that cruel\nserpent: you have now saved the lives of our children; whenever you are in\nneed, therefore, send to us and we will help you; and as for these little\neagles, take them, and let them be your servants.'\n\nAt this the Prince was very glad, and the two eaglets crossed their wings, on\nwhich he mounted; and they carried him far, far away over the thick jungles,\nuntil he came to the place where grew the circle of palm trees: in the midst\nof which stood the six chat-tees full of water. It was the middle of the day,\nand the heat was very great. All round the trees were the genii, fast asleep:\nnevertheless, there were such countless thousands of them, that it would have\nbeen quite impossible for any one to walk through their ranks to the place;\ndown swooped the strong-winged eaglets--down jumped the Prince: in an instant\nhe had overthrown the six chat-tees full of water, and seized the little green\nparrot, which he rolled up in his cloak; while, as he mounted again into the\nair, all the genii below awoke, and finding their treasure gone, set up a wild\nand melancholy howl.\n\nAway, away flew the little eagles, till they came to their home in the great\ntree; then the Prince said to the old eagles, 'Take back your little ones;\nthey have done me good service; if ever again I stand in need of help, I will\nnot fail to come to you.' He then continued his journey on foot till he\narrived once more at the Magician's palace; where he sat down at the door and\nbegan playing with the parrot. Punchkin saw him, and came to him quickly, and\nsaid, 'My boy, where did you get that parrot? Give it to me, I pray you.' But\nthe Prince answered, 'Oh no, I cannot give away my parrot, it is a great pet\nof mine; I have had it many years.' Then the Magician said, 'If it is an old\nfavourite, I can understand your not caring to give it away--but come, what\nwill you sell it for?' 'Sir,' replied the Prince, 'I will not sell my parrot.'\n\nThen Punchkin got frightened, and said, 'Anything, anything; name what price\nyou will, and it shall be yours.' The Prince answered, 'Let the seven Rajah's\nsons whom you turned into rocks and trees be instantly liberated.' 'It is done\nas you desire,' said the Magician, 'only give me my parrot.' [And with that,\nby a stroke of his wand, Balna's husband and his brothers resumed their\nnatural shapes.] 'Now give me my parrot,' repeated Punchkin. 'Not so fast, my\nmaster,' rejoined the Prince: 'I must first beg that you will restore to life\nall whom you have thus imprisoned.'\n\nThe Magician immediately waved his wand again; and whilst he cried, in an\nimploring voice, 'Give me my parrot!' the whole garden became suddenly alive:\nwhere rocks, and stones, and trees had been before, stood Rajah's, and Punts,\n5 and Sirdars,  6 and mighty men on prancing horses, and jewelled pages, and\ntroops of armed attendants.\n\n'Give me my parrot!' cried Punchkin. Then the boy took hold of the parrot, and\ntore off one of his wings; and as he did so the Magician's right arm fell off.\n\nPunchkin then stretched out his left arm, crying, 'Give me my parrot!' The\nPrince pulled off the parrot's second wing, and the Magician's left arm\ntumbled off.\n\n'Give me my parrot!' cried he, and fell on his knees. The Prince pulled off\nthe parrot's right leg, the Magician's right leg fell off: the Prince pulled\noff the parrot's left leg, down fell the Magician's left.\n\nNothing remained of him save the limbless body and the head; but still he\nrolled his eyes, and cried, 'Give me my parrot!' 'Take your parrot, then,'\ncried the boy, and with that he wrung the bird's neck, and threw it at the\nMagician; and, as he did so, Punchkin's head twisted round, and, with a\nfearful groan, he died!\n\nThen they let Balna out of the tower; and she, her son, and the seven Princes\nwent to their own country, and lived very happily ever afterwards. And as to\nthe rest of the world, every one went to his own house.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1](odd05.htm#fr_23) The little one.\n\n[2](odd05.htm#fr_24) see Notes.\n\n[3](odd05.htm#fr_25) Prime Minister.\n\n[4](odd05.htm#fr_26) Citrus decumana, the Shaddock of the West Indies.\n\n[5](odd05.htm#fr_27) Principal ministers.\n\n[6](odd05.htm#fr_28) Nobles or chiefs.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II.
