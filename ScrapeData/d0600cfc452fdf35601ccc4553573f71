The Year, indeed, is Man;--the Praya _n_ iya Atiratra is his\nbreath, for by means of the breath men go forward (prayanti); and the \xc3\x82rambha\n_n_ iya\n\np. 161\n\n[paragraph continues] (opening) day 1 is speech, for by means of speech men\nundertake (arabh) whatever they do undertake.\n\n12:2:4:22\\. The Abhiplava-sha _d_ aha is this right hand 2. This (little\nfinger) is the first day thereof,--this (upper joint 3)is its morning-service,\nthis (middle joint) its midday-service, and this (lower joint) its evening-\nservice: it is in place of the Gayatri, whence this (little finger) is the\nshortest of these (fingers).\n\n12:2:4:33\\. This (third finger) is the second day,--this (upper joint) is its\nmorning-service, this (middle joint) its midday-service, and this (lower\njoint) its evening-service: it is in place of the Trish _t_ ubh, whence this\n(third finger) is larger than this (little finger).\n\n12:2:4:44\\. This (middle finger) is the third day,--this is its morning-\nservice, this its midday-service, and this its evening-service: it is in place\nof the _G_ agati, whence this is the largest of these (fingers).\n\n12:2:4:55\\. This (fore-finger) is the fourth day,--this is its morning-\nservice, this its midday-service, and this its evening-service: it is in place\nof the Vira _g_ ; for the Vira _g_ is food, whence this (fore-finger) is the\nmost food-eating 4 of these (fingers).\n\np. 162\n\n12:2:4:66\\. This (thumb) is the fifth day,--this is its morning-service, this\nits midday-service, and this its evening-service: it is in place of the\nPa\xe1\xb9\x85kti, for the Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti is broad 1, as it were, whence this (thumb) is the\nbroadest of these (fingers).\n\n12:2:4:77\\. This (right arm) is the sixth day,--this (forearm 2) is its\nmorning-service, this (upper arm) its midday-service, and this (shoulder-\nblade) its evening-service: it is in place of the Ati _kh_ andas, whence this\n(arm) is larger than those (fingers). That day is a Gayatri one, whence this\nshoulder-blade is the shortest: this Abhiplava-sha _d_ aha (extends) in this,\nin this, in this, and in this, direction 3; and the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya is the\nbody (trunk).\n\n12:2:4:88\\. Now, as to this, Pai\xe1\xb9\x85gya, knowing this, said, 'The Abhiplavas leap\nabout (plavante), as it were, and the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya stands (stha) 4, as it\nwere; for\n\np. 163\n\nthis (man) leaps about, as it were, with his limbs, and he stands, as it were,\nwith his body.'\n\n12:2:4:99\\. The Triv _ri_ t (stoma) is its head, whence that (head) is\nthreefold (triv _ri_ t)--skin, bone, and brain.\n\n12:2:4:1010\\. The Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a (fifteen-versed hymn-form) is the neck-\njoints,--for there are fourteen of these (joints) 1, and the vital force is\nthe fifteenth; hence by means of that (neck), though being small, man bears a\nheavy burden: therefore the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a is the neck.\n\n12:2:4:1111\\. The Saptada _s_ a (seventeen-versed hymn-form) is the chest; for\nthere are eight ' _g_ atru 2' on the one\n\np. 164\n\nside, and eight on the other, and the chest itself is the seventeenth:\ntherefore the Saptada _s_ a (stoma) is the chest.\n\n12:2:4:1212\\. The Ekavi _m_ _s_ a (twenty-one-versed hymn-form) is the belly,\nfor inside the belly there are twenty 'kuntapa 1,' and the belly is the\ntwenty-first: therefore the Ekavi _m_ _s_ a (stoma) is the belly.\n\n12:2:4:1313\\. The Tri _n_ ava (thrice nine-versed hymn-form) is the two sides\n(par _s_ va);--there are thirteen ribs (par _s_ u) on the one side, and\nthirteen on the other 2, and the sides make up the thrice ninth: therefore the\nTri _n_ ava (stoma) is the two sides.\n\n12:2:4:1414\\. The Trayastri _m_ _s_ a (thirty-three-versed hymn-form)\n\np. 165\n\nis the spine; for there are thirty-two 'karukara 1' of that (spine), and the\nspine itself is the thirty-third: therefore the Trayastri _m_ _s_ a (stoma) is\nthe spine.\n\n12:2:4:1515\\. The Abhi _g_ it is the same as this right ear; the first\nSvarasaman is this white part of the eye, the second the black part, and the\nthird the pupil; the Vishuvat is the nose, the first backward Svarasaman is\nthis pupil of the eye, the second the black, and the third the white part\nthereof.\n\n12:2:4:1616\\. The Vi _s_ va _g_ it is the same as this left ear; the P _ri_ sh\n_th_ ya and Abhiplava have been told; the Go and \xc3\x82yus are the two downward\nbreathings which there are (in the body); the Da _s_ aratra the limbs, the\nMahavrata is the mouth; and the Udayaniya Atiratra the up-breathing, for by\nmeans of the up-breathing men go upwards (ud-yanti): such is that year as\nestablished in the body; and, verily, whosoever thus knows that year as\nestablished in the body, establishes himself by offspring and cattle in this,\nand by immortality in the other, world.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[161:1](sbe44052.htm#fr_473) Hereby the _K_ aturvi _m_ _s_ a day would seem to\nbe meant (as, indeed, it is also taken by Harisvamin, see [p.\n157](sbe44051.htm#page_157), note [2](sbe44051.htm#fn_470);[*](errata.htm#1)\n[p. 167](sbe44053.htm#page_167), note [1](sbe44053.htm#fn_487).\n\n[161:2](sbe44052.htm#fr_474) The right hand is apparently taken here to\nrepresent the four limbs--the arms and legs. In Sanskrit the terms for finger\nand toe (as for thumb and large toe) are the same.\n\n[161:3](sbe44052.htm#fr_475) That is, apparently the bone joining the palm;\nthough possibly the one forming the extreme end of the finger may be intended.\nBut inasmuch as the morning-service has five stotras as compared with the two\nof the evening-service the former might be expected to be compared with the\nlarger of the two bones.\n\n[161:4](sbe44052.htm#fr_476) Prof. Weber, Prati _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ asutra, p. 97, refers\nto II, 4, 2, 18, where, in his opinion, the passage '(thus) they ladle out\n(food) for men' p. 162 points to the fore-finger as the finger used most in\neating. This is not improbable, though Saya _n_ a, as well as the commentary\non Katy. IV, 1, 10, it is true, does not interpret the passage in that way.\n\n[162:1](sbe44052.htm#fr_477) Viz. inasmuch as it consists of five padas,--\ninstead of three, as in the case of the Gayatri, or four, as in that of the\nothers.\n\n[162:2](sbe44052.htm#fr_478) Thus also Harisvamin (hardly, the palm; but see\np. 161, note 3).\n\n[162:3](sbe44052.htm#fr_479) Viz. in the direction of the two arms and the two\nlegs. There being, in nine of the twelve months of the year, four Abhiplavas\nand one P _ri_ sh _th_ ya in each month, the two kinds of six-days'\nperformances as regards numbers, certainly offer an analogy to the limbs and\nthe body.\n\n[162:4](sbe44052.htm#fr_480) This etymological quibble seems to refer to the\nfact that the Abhiplavas are performed before the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya in the\nfirst half of the year, and after them in the second half; though the same\nfeature of change might, vice versa, be applied to the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya. It\nis possible, however, that the author may refer here to other characteristic\nfeatures of the two kinds of Sha _d_ ahas; and it cannot be denied that the\nAbhiplava days are liable to much greater change than the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya\ndays. The constant change in the p. 163 'sequence of stomas' in the Abhiplava\nhas already been referred to ([p. 148](sbe44049.htm#page_148), note\n[1](sbe44050.htm#fn_445)). Another source of change, in the Abhiplava, is the\npeculiar way in which the Brahmasaman (or Brahma _n_ a _kh_ a _m_ sin's P _ri_\nsh _th_ astotra) is varied from day to day. For, whilst during the months\npreceding the Vishuvat day, the Abhivarta tune it used for this stotra on each\nday, but with different Pragatha verses chanted thereto from day to day;\nduring the second half of the year, on the other hand, the same text (Sama-\nveda II, 806) is used throughout, whilst its tune is varied from day to day.\nSince in the second half of the year the order of the days of the P _ri_ sh\n_th_ ya-sha _d_ aha must be reversed, whilst this is optionally the case as\nregards the Abhiplava, this feature can hardly be referred to here.\n\n[163:1](sbe44052.htm#fr_481) The 'griva _h_ ' thus, as far as man is\nconcerned, include not only the seven cervical vertebrae, but also the upper\nseven dorsal vertebrae, being those to which the true ribs are attached. It is\nworth remarking, however, that in large birds such as the eagle, the neck\nitself consists of fourteen vertebrae.\n\n[163:2](sbe44052.htm#fr_482) The St. Petersb. Dict. takes ' _g_ atru' in the\nsense of 'tuberculae costarum,' or tubercles of the ribs, the projections near\nthe 'heads' of the ribs where these join the spinal vertebrae; this\nconjectural meaning being based on VIII, 6, 2, 10, where the ribs are said to\nbe fastened on both sides to the kikasa _h_ (? sternum) and the _g_ atrava\n_h_. Against this conjecture (as the Dict. remarks) is the circumstance that\nthe _g_ atrava _h_ are here said to form part of the chest; and, besides, the\ntubercle of the rib is not a separate bone, and would hardly be likely to be\nspecially singled out in this p. 164 connection. Perhaps, therefore, the _g_\natrava _h_ may rather be the costal cartilages connecting the seven true ribs\nwith the sternum, and along with them the ligament of the collar-bone where it\njoins the sternum; in which case the former passage would have to be\nunderstood in the sense that the ribs are on both (the right and left) sides\nfastened on to the costal cartilages and (through them) to the 'kikasa _h_ ,'\nthe breast-bone, or rather the several bones or plates of which the sternum\nconsists, as articulated with the clavicles and the true ribs. It is possible,\nhowever, that 'kikasa _h_ ' may have a different meaning from that here\nassigned to it, in acc. with the St. Petersb. Dict. Indeed, one would expect\nthe 'kikasa _h_ ' and ' _g_ atrava _h_ ' on different ends of the ribs.\n\n[164:1](sbe44052.htm#fr_483) The meaning of 'kuntapa' is likewise doubtful.\nThe St. Petersb. Dict. suggests that certain glands may he intended thereby;\nbut possibly the term may refer to the transverse processes (forming spikes,\nso to speak; cf. kunta) on both sides of the ten lower spinal vertebrae below\nthe vertebra of the last true rib,--i.e. of the five lower dorsal, and the\nfive lumbar vertebrae.\n\n[164:2](sbe44052.htm#fr_484) The clavicle, or collar-bone, would thus seem to\nbe classed along with the ribs. Rather peculiar, in the anatomical phraseology\nemployed in the Brahma _n_ a, is the collateral use of 'par _s_ u' and 'p _ri_\nsh _t_ i' for 'rib'; and it is by no means clear that there is no distinction\nbetween the two terms. In connection with the Reta _h_ si _k_ bricks the term\n'p _ri_ sh _t_ i' seems to be invariably used,--cf. VIII, 6, 2, 7, as against\nib. paragraph 10 (par _s_ u).\n\n[165:1](sbe44052.htm#fr_485) This is another term, the exact meaning of which\nis somewhat doubtful. The St. Petersb. Dict. takes 'karukara' to refer to the\nvertebrae of the spinal column; and if that be correct, the term would seem to\ninclude not only the twenty-four joints of the backbone down to the last\nlumbar vertebrae, but also the appendages of the spine, viz. the sacrum with\nits five, and the coccyx with its four pieces: this, it is true, yields\nthirty-three, instead of thirty-two, parts, but it seems scarcely possible in\nany other way--as, for instance, by taking into account the epiphysial plates\nbetween the vertebrae, along with the latter--to arrive at a total\napproximating that mentioned in the above passage.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XII, 3, 1.
