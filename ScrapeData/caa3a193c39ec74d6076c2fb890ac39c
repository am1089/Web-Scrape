Some, on account of the existence of a Self within a body.\n\nIn all meditations on the highest Self the nature of the meditating subject\nhas to be ascertained no less than the nature of the object of meditation and\nof the mode of meditation. The question then arises whether the meditating\nSelf is to be viewed as the knowing, doing, and enjoying Self, subject to\ntransmigration; or as that Self which Pra _g_ apati describes ( _Kh_. Up.\nVIII, 1), viz. a Self\n\np. 674\n\nfree from all sin and imperfection.--Some hold the former view, on the ground\nthat the meditating Self is within a body. For as long as the Self dwells\nwithin a body, it _is_ a knower, doer, enjoyer, and so on, and it can bring\nabout the result of its meditation only as viewed under that aspect. A person\nwho, desirous of the heavenly world or a similar result, enters on some\nsacrificial action may, after he has reached that result, possess\ncharacteristics different from those of a knowing, doing, and enjoying\nsubject, but those characteristics cannot be attributed to him as long as he\nis in the state of having to bring about the means of accomplishing those\nends; in the latter state he must be viewed as an ordinary agent, and there it\nwould be of no use to view him as something different. And the same holds\nequally good with regard to a person engaged in meditation.--But, an objection\nis raised, the text 'as the thought of a man is in this world, so he will be\nwhen he has departed this life' ( _Kh._ Up. III, 14, 1) _does_ declare a\ndifference (between the agent engaged in sacrificial action, and the\nmeditating subject), and from this it follows that the meditating Self is to\nbe conceived as having a nature free from all evil, and so on.--Not so, the\nPurvapakshin replies; for the clause, 'howsoever they meditate on him,' proves\nthat that text refers to the equality of the object meditated upon (not of the\nmeditating subject).--To this the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 52. But this is not so, but rather difference; since it is of the being\nof that; as in the case of intuition](sbe48436.htm)\n\n"
