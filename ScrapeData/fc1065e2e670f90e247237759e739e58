S\'ri S\'ankaracharya\'s _Dakshinamurti-Stotra_ , an ode to the Divine Self,\nwith Sri Suresvaracharya\'s exposition named Manasollasa\' "Brilliant play of\nthought."\n\nii. S\'ri Suresvaracharya\'s _Pranava-Vartika_ treating of the contemplation of\nthe Supreme Atman by means of the Pranava.\n\niii. _Dakshinamurti-Upanishad_.\n\nS\'ankaracharya\'s immortal Hymn and the two works of Suresvaracharya herein\ncomprised epitomise the whole Vedanta Doctrine as expounded by the two authors\nin their commentaries on the Upanishads, and form a good introduction to a\nstudy of the subject. As a terse expression of the fundamental truths of the\nVedanta, the well-known Hymn of S\'ankaracharya forms a suitable text upon\nwhich the student may meditate and thereby construct the whole doctrine for\nhimself. The reader will also be struck with the catholicity of the teaching,\nwhich is not addressed to any particular class of people nor contains any\nreference to distinctions of caste and religious order. While concisely\nstating the process by which the oneness of Self and the unreality of all else\nis established. Manasollasa is more original and telling than any of the later\nmanuals which state the doctrine as derived from the expositions of the two\neminent leaders of the Advaita-Vedanta school of thought.\n\nVery little need be said regarding the high position which S\'ankaracharya\nholds among the teachers of\n\np. vi\n\nthe Vedic Religion. Of Suresvaracharya, however, his immediate disciple and\nliterary collaborator, ordinary students of Vedanta know less than they ought\nto, simply because his writings have long remained inaccessible to all but the\nvery select few who entered the fourth order of sannyasa and were\nintellectually qualified to study the highly erudite exposition of philosophy\nand metaphysics. Suffice it to say that, according to all received accounts,\nthe great aim of S\'ankaracharya\'s missionary peregrinations was to secure the\neminent mimamsaka\'s allegiance to his own system of Vedanta. The nature of the\nwork to which this disciple is said to have been detailed by the Teacher, and\nthe masterly fashion in which he has done it,--the work, namely, of\nelucidating systematising, supplementing and even improving upon the great\nMaster\'s teachings,--more than justifies the honourable position which\ntradition has unanimously accorded to him. He is known as the _Vartika-kara_ ,\nauthor of elucidative commentary on the teachings of S\'ankaracharya who is\nknown as the _Bh ashyak\xc4\x81ra_, author of original commentaries. "Vartika" is\ndefined as follows:\n\n_Ukt anuktaduruktarthavyaktakari tu vartikam_.\n\n"A _vartika_ is that which clearly explains what has been said, what has been\nleft unsaid, and what has been ill said." Five works of the kind are\nattributed to Suresvaracharya, all of them having been recently published in\nIndia:\n\n(1) _Manasollasa_ (Mysore).*\n\n(2) _Pranava-vartika_ ( " ).*\n\n(3) _Naishkarmya-siddhi_ , a manual of Advaita doctrine (Bombay Sanskrit\nSeries).\n\np. vii\n\n(4) An exposition of Sankaracharya\'s commentary on the Taittiriya-Upanishad\n(Poona, A\'nandasrama Series).\n\n(5) An exposition of Sankaracharya\'s [commentry](errata.htm#0) on the\nBrihadaranyaka-Upanishad (Poona, A\'nandasrama Series).\n\nSuresvaracharya\'s exposition of the Vedanta Doctrine is often very original\nand is throughout marked with such thoroughness, precision, and clearness that\nit forms a very valuable supplement to the teachings of the Upanishads; and\nits authority on all knotty points is acknowledged with due reverence and\nsubmission by all the Advaitic writers of later days.\n\nAs an effective aid to a right understanding of the truths taught in the\nVedanta, Sankaracharya\'s Hymn as well as Sruti inculcates highest devotion to\nthe Divine Being as the Guru of Gurus, and an equal devotion to one\'s own\nimmediate Guru who should be regarded as an incarnation of that Guru of Gurus.\nThe Dakshinamurti-Upanishad shows in what form Siva, the Guru of Gurus, should\nbe imaged and devoutly worshipped in the heart by the neophyte who is about to\nengage in a contemplation of the truths taught in the hymn. The style of the\nUpanishad is in perfect keeping with the character of the Minor Upanishads\ndescribed in my introduction to "the Minor Upanishads, Vol. I."\n\nAs Sures\'varacharya\'s Manasollasa refers to various philosophical systems of\nhis day, I have thought it necessary to add an introduction to it treating\nbriefly of the origin, methods, and fundamental tenets of the several systems\nreferred to, so that the reader may have a comprehensive view of the whole\nrange of Indian\n\np. viii\n\nphilosophy, at whose summit, towering high above all, stands Vedanta, the\npinnacle of Aryan thought.\n\nA.
