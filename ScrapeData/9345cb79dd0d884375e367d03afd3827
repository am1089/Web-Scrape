The chasing [1](sbe3237.htm#an_5:55:1:1) Maruts with gleaming spears, the\ngolden-breasted, have gained great strength, they move along on quick well-\nbroken horses;--when they went in triumph, the chariots followed.\n\n2\\. You have yourselves, you know, acquired power; you shine bright and wide,\nyou great ones. They have even measured the sky with their strength;--when\nthey went in triumph, the chariots followed.\n\n3\\. The strong heroes, born together, and nourished together, have further\ngrown to real beauty. They shine brilliantly like the rays of the sun;--when\nthey went in triumph, the chariots followed.\n\n4\\. Your greatness, O Maruts, is to be honoured, it is to be yearned for like\nthe sight of the sun. Place us also in immortality;--when they went in\ntriumph, the chariots followed.\n\n5\\. O Maruts you raise [1](sbe3237.htm#an_5:55:5:1) the rain from the sea, and\nrain it down, O yeomen [2](sbe3237.htm#an_5:55:5:2)! Your milch-cows, O\ndestroyers [3](sbe3237.htm#an_5:55:5:3), are never destroyed;--when they went\nin triumph, the chariots followed.\n\n6\\. When you have joined the deer as horses [1](sbe3237.htm#an_5:55:6:1) to\nthe shafts, and have clothed yourselves in golden garments, then, O Maruts,\nyou scatter all enemies;--when they went in triumph, the chariots followed.\n\n7\\. Not mountains, not rivers have kept you back, wherever you see, O Maruts,\nthere you go. You\n\np. 334\n\ngo even round heaven and earth;--when they went in triumph, the chariots\nfollowed.\n\n8\\. Be it old, O Maruts, or be it new, be it spoken, O Vasus, or be it\nrecited, you take cognisance of it all;--when they went in triumph, the\nchariots followed.\n\n9\\. Have mercy on us, O Maruts, do not strike us, extend to us your manifold\nprotection. Do remember the praise, the friendship;--when they went in\ntriumph, the chariots followed.\n\n10\\. Lead us, O Maruts, towards greater wealth, and out of tribulations, when\nyou have been praised. O worshipful Maruts, accept our offering, and let us be\nlords of treasures!\n\np. 335\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same poet, _S_ yava _s_ va \xc3\x82treya. Metre, 1-9 _G_ agati; 10 Trish _t_ ubh.\nNone of the verses occurs in SV., VS., AV. Verse 5 is found in TS. II, 4, 8,\n2; MS. II, 4, 7. The refrain probably means that when the Maruts march in\ntriumph, the chariots of their army, or the chariots of other gods, follow.\nThe latter view is taken by Saya _n_ a, TS. II, 4, 8, 2.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Praya _g_ yu, generally explained by rushing forward, but in that\nsense hardly to be derived from ya _g_ , to sacrifice, may stand for an old\nVedic form prayakshyu, changed into praya _g_ yu by priests who had forgotten\nthe root yaksh, and thought of nothing but sacrifices. This root yaksh has\nbeen identified by Grassmann with OHG. jagon (venari, persequi), originally to\nrush after, to hunt, to try to injure or kill (cf. m _ri_ ga _n_ yava _h_ , X,\n40, 4). This would explain most derivations from yaksh, not excepting the\nlater Yakshas, and . would yield an excellent sense for prayakshyu, as an\nepithet of the Maruts. Sec note to VII, 56, 16. Pischel, Ved. Stud. I, p. 98,\nis satisfied with deriving praya _g_ yu and p _ri_ sh _th_ apraya _g_ from the\nroot ya _g_ , to sacrifice, and translates it by sacrificing, but in the sense\nof causing sacrifices to be offered.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. The verb irayatha is transitive; see Gaedicke, Accusativ, p. 54, and\ncompare AV. IV, 27, 4. apa _h_ samudra\xc2\xb4d divam ud vahanti.\n\nNote 2. I have translated purishi _n_ a _h_ by yeomen, in the sense of\ncultivators of the land. I have followed Roth, who shows that purisha means\nsoil, and that purishin is used for an occupier of the soil, a landlord. See\nK. Z. XXVI, p. 65.\n\nNote 3. Dasra, powerful, a common epithet of the A _s_ vins, seems here, when\njoined with dasyanti, to retain something\n\np. 336\n\nof its etymological meaning, which comes out clearly in das, to attack, unless\nit is derived from da _m_ s.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. I prefer to translate here 'the deer as horses,' not 'the speckled\nhorses.' See, however, II, 34, 4, and Pischel, Ved. Stud. p. 226.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 56.
