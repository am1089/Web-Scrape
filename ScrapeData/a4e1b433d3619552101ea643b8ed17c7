 \nThen own his merit or detect  \nHis guile, and welcome or reject.\'  \n   Then Sarabhu the bold and brave  \nIn turn his prudent sentence gave:  \n\'Yea, Rama, send a skilful spy  \nWith keenest tact to test and try.  \nThen let the stranger, as is just,  \nObtain or be refused thy trust.\'  \n   Then he whose heart was rich in store  \nOf scripture\'s life-directing lore.  \nKing Jambavan, stood forth and cried:  \n\'Suspect, suspect a foe allied  \nWith Ravan lord of Lanka\'s isle,  \nAnd Rakshas sin and Rakshas guile."  \n   Then Maiuda, wisest chief, who knew  \nThe wrong, the right, the false, the true,  \nPondered a while, then silence broke,  \nAnd thus his sober counsel spoke:  \n\'Let one with gracious speech draw near  \nAnd gently charm Vibhishan\'s ear,  \nTill he the soothing witchery feel  \nAnd all his secret heart reveal.  \nSo thou his aims and hopes shalt know,  \nAnd hail the friend or shun the foe.\'  \n   \'Not he,\' Hanuman cried, \'not he  \nWho taught the Gods, 1 may rival thee,  \nSupreme in power of quickest sense,  \nFirst in the art of eloquence.  \nBut hear me soothly speak, O King,  \nAnd learn the hope to which I cling.  \nVibhishan comes no cratty spy:  \nUrged by his brother\'s fault to fly.  \nWith righteous soul that loathes the sin,  \nHe fled from Lanka and his kin.  \n\np. 440  \n\nIf strangers question, doubt will rise  \nAnd chill the heart of one so wise.  \nMarred by distrust the parle will end,  \nAnd then wilt lose a faithful friend.  \nNor let it seem so light a thing  \nTo sound a stranger\'s heart, O King.  \nAnd he, I ween, whate\'er he say,  \nWill ne\'er an evil thought betray.  \nHe comes a friend in happy time,  \nLoathing his brother for his crime.  \nHis ear has heard thine old renown,  \nThe might that struck King Bali down,  \nAnd set Sugriva on the throne.  \nAnd looking now to thee alone  \nHe comes thy matchless aid to win  \nAnd punish Ravan for his sin.  \nThus have I tried thy heart to move,  \nAnd thus Vibhishan\'s truth to prove.  \nStill in his friendship I confide;  \nBut ponder, wisest, and decide.\'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[438:1b](ry416.htm#fr_937) This dessertion to the enemy is somewhat abrupt,\nand is narrated with brevity not usual with Valmiki. In the Bengal recension\nthe preceding speakers and speeches differ considerably from those given in\nthe text which I follow. Vibhishan is kicked from his seat by Ravan, and then,\nafter telling his mother what has happened, he flies to Mount Kailasa where he\nhas an interview with Siva, and by his advice seeks Rama and the Vanar army.\n\n[439:1](ry416.htm#fr_938) Vrihuspati the preceptor of the Gods.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XVIII.: Rama\'s Speech.](ry417.htm)\n\n'
