The being, on the other hand, which in the teaching of Pra\n_g_ apati is described as first having a body due to karman--as we see from\npassages such as 'they strike it as it were, they cut it as it were'--and as\nafterwards approaching the highest light, and then manifesting its essential\nqualities, viz. freedom from sin, &c., is the individual soul; not the small\nether (or Brahman).\n\nThe next Sutra supplies a further reason for this conclusion.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 21.
