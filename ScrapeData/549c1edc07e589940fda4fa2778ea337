But on account of Scripture; (Brahman's possession of various powers)\nbeing founded upon the word.\n\nThe 'but' sets aside the difficulty raised. There is no\n\np. 474\n\ninappropriateness; 'on account of Scripture.' Scripture declares on the one\nhand that Brahman is not made up of parts, and on the other that from it a\nmultiform creation proceeds. And in matters vouched for by Scripture we must\nconform our ideas to what Scripture actually says.--But then Scripture might\nbe capable of conveying to us ideas of things altogether self-contradictory;\nlike as if somebody were to tell us 'Water with fire'!--The Sutra therefore\nadds 'on account of its being founded on the word.' As the possession, on\nBrahman's part, of various powers (enabling it to emit the world) rests\nexclusively on the authority of the word of the Veda and thus differs\naltogether from other matters (which fall within the sphere of the other means\nof knowledge also), the admission of such powers is not contrary to reason.\nBrahman cannot be either proved or disproved by means of generalisations from\nexperience.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 28.
