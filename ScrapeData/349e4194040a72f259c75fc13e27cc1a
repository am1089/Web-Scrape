Should it be said that from a subsequent passage (it appears that the\nindividual Soul is meant); rather (the soul) in so far as its true nature has\nbecome manifest.\n\nThe Purvapakshin now maintains that we ascertain from a subsequent declaration\nmade by Pra _g_ apati that it is just the individual Soul that possesses\nfreedom from sin and the other qualities enumerated. The whole teaching of Pra\n_g_ apati, he says, refers to the individual Soul only. Indra having heard\nthat Pra _g_ apati had spoken about a Self free from sin, old age, &c., the\nenquiry into which enables the soul to obtain all worlds and desires,\napproaches Pra _g_ apati with the wish to learn the true nature of that Self\nwhich should be enquired into. Pra _g_ apati thereupon, wishing to test the\ncapacity of his pupil for receiving true instruction, gives him successive\ninformation about the embodied soul in the state of waking, dream and\ndreamless sleep. When he finds that Indra sees no good in instruction of this\nkind and thus shows himself fit to receive instruction about the true nature\nof the disembodied Self, he explains to him that the body is a mere abode for\na ruling Self; that that bodiless Self is essentially immortal; and that the\nsoul, as long as it is joined to a body due to karman, is compelled to\nexperience pleasure and pain corresponding to its embodied state, while it\nrises above all this when it has freed itself from the body (VIII, 12, 1). He\nthen continues: 'Thus that serenity having risen from this body and approached\nthe highest light, appears in its own form'; thus teaching him the true\nnature, free from a body, of the individual soul. He next informs him that the\n'highest light' which the soul reaches is the supreme Person ('That is the\nsupreme Person'), and that the soul having reached that highest light and\nfreed itself from what obscured its own true nature, obtains in the world of\nBrahman whatever enjoyments it desires, and is no longer connected with a body\nspringing from karman and inseparable from pain and pleasure, or with anything\nelse that causes distress. ('He moves about there laughing,' &c.). He next\nillustrates\n\np. 322\n\nthe connexion with a body, of the soul in the Sa _m_ sara state, by means of a\ncomparison: 'Like as a horse attached to a cart,' &c. After that he explains\nthat the eye and the other sense-organs are instruments of knowledge, colour,\nand so on, the objects of knowledge, and the individual Self the knowing\nsubject; and that hence that Self is different from the body and the sense-\norgans ('Now where the sight has entered' up to 'the mind is his divine eye').\nNext he declares that, after having divested itself of the body and the\nsenses, the Self perceives all the objects of its desire by means of its\n'divine eye,' i.e. the power of cognition which constitutes its essential\nnature ('He by means of the divine eye,' &c.). He further declares that those\nwho have true knowledge know the Self as such ('on that Self the devas\nmeditate'); and in conclusion teaches that he who has that true knowledge of\nthe Self obtains for his reward the intuition of Brahman--which is suggested\nby what the text says about the obtaining of all worlds and all desires ('He\nobtains all worlds and all desires,' &c., up to the end of the chapter).--It\nthus appears that the entire chapter proposes as the object of cognition the\nindividual soul free from sin, and so on. The qualities, viz. freedom from\nguilt, &c., may thus belong to the individual Self, and on this ground we\nconclude that the small ether is the individual Self.\n\nThis view the second half of the Sutra sets aside. The two sections, that\nwhich treats of the small ether and that which contains the teaching of Pra\n_g_ apati, have different topics. Pra _g_ apati's teaching refers to the\nindividual soul, whose true nature, with its qualities such as freedom from\nevil, &c., is at first hidden by untruth, while later on, when it has freed\nitself from the bondage of karman, risen from the body, and approached the\nhighest light, it manifests itself in its true form and then is characterised\nby freedom from all evil and by other auspicious qualities. In the section\ntreating of the small ether, on the other hand, we have to do with the small\nether, i.e. the highest Brahman, whose true nature is never hidden, and which\ntherefore is unconditionally characterised by freedom from evil, and so on.--\n\np. 323\n\n[paragraph continues] Moreover, the daharaka _s_ a-section ascribes to the\nsmall ether other attributes which cannot belong to the individual Self even\n'when its true nature has manifested itself.' The small ether is there called\na bank and support of all worlds; and one of its names,'satyam,' is explained\nto imply that it governs all sentient and non-sentient beings. All this also\nproves that the small ether is none other than the highest Self. That the\nindividual soul, 'even when its true nature is manifest,' cannot be viewed as\na bank and support of the worlds, &c., we shall show under IV, 4.\n\nBut if this is so, what then is the meaning of the reference to the individual\nsoul which is made in the section treating of the small ether, viz. in the\npassage, 'Now that serene being, which after having risen from this body,' &c.\n(VIII, 3, 4)?\n\nTo this question the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 19.
