(1).\n\nI ever prostrate to the lotus-feet of Him by whose grace I always realise the\nnature of the\n\np. 184\n\nself to the effect that I alone am the Supreme and that all things are merely\nsuperimposed on me. (2).\n\nSorely afflicted by the sun of the three miseries *, and perplexed in mind,\nsome one, after acquiring the qualifications of mind-control, etc., asks the\ngood Master as follows. (3).\n\nO Lord, out of mere mercy, tell me briefly bow I may, without (much) effort,\nbe liberated from this bondage of births and deaths. (4).\n\n(The Master replies.) The manner of thy speech seems to me to be excellent. I\nshall explain to thee clearly which is which. Listen with an attentive mind.\n(5).\n\np. 185\n\nThe knowledge relating to the identity of the individual soul and the Supreme\nSelf that arises from texts like "That thou art," is the means to liberation.\n(6).\n\nWhat is the individual soul? What is the Supreme Self? How can there be\nidentity between the two? And how can texts like "That thou art" express the\nsame? (7).\n\nWe shall explain it (thus). What else, indeed, is the individual soul except\nthou alone. Thou that questionest me, \'who am I\', art Brahman itself, without\ndoubt. (8).\n\np. 186\n\nI have not yet clearly grasped, O Lord, even the meaning of the words, "I am\nBrahman." How can I understand, tell me, the meaning of the sentence (as a\nwhole)? (9).\n\nWhat thou sayest is true and free from reproach. For, a knowledge of the word-\nmeaning is indeed essential for the understanding of the sentence-meaning.\n(10).\n\nWhy dost thou not understand thyself,--thou whose very nature is reality and\nbliss and (pure) consciousness that is the witness of the individual\nconsciousness and all its workings? (11).\n\nLeaving aside all thought relating to the body, etc., thou shouldst ever\nmeditate upon\n\np. 187\n\nthat whose nature is reality, bliss, and knowledge and which is the witness of\nconsciousness, as thyself. (12).\n\nBecause the body has form, etc., like an earthen vessel or other object, and\nis, like an earthen vessel, composed of the (five) great elements, ether,\netc., it cannot be the self. (13).\n\nIf, for the reasons aforesaid, this body is not the self; reveal the self,\nthen, as clearly as a berry in the hand. (14).\n\nAs the witness of an earthen pot is different, from the pot and is not the pot\nin any sense, so is the witness of the body. Understand, therefore, "I am not\nthe body." (15).\n\np. 188\n\nConclude, in the same way, "I am the witness of the senses and not the senses\nthemselves." So, too, understand, "I am not the mind, the consciousness, or\nthe life-force." (16).\n\nAlso "I am not the combination (of these)." Understand, thus, by intelligent\nreasoning, the witness that is distinct from the object. (17).\n\nUnderstand "I am He by whose mere proximity, the body, senses and other object\nbecome of (all) activities like selection, etc. (18).\n\np. 189\n\nUnderstand "I am that inner self which impels, the consciousness, etc., but is\nitself unchanging, like the lodestone. (19).\n\nUnderstand "I am He by whose proximity, the body, senses, mind, and life-\nforces, though motionless, vet seem like the self that is not so. (20).\n\n\'My mind had gone elsewhere, but has now been steadied.\' Understand "I am He\nwho knows the above activity of the mind." (21).\n\nUnderstand "I am He who is the direct witness, himself changeless, of waking,\ndream and sleep, and of the presence and absence of objects, and of all phases\nof consciousness. (22).\n\np. 190\n\nAs it is admitted that the light revealing (the presence of) a pot is other\nthan the pot, so am I of the nature of knowledge, the dweller in the body that\nreveals the body. (23).\n\nUnderstand "I am the witness that is the dearest of all, for whose sake alone,\nsons, wealth and other objects are dear." (24).\n\nUnderstand "I am the witness who, being himself the object of highest love,\nfeels \'let me never cease to be, but let me ever exist.\'" (25).\n\nThe consciousness that is the witness is said to be the meaning of the word\n"thou." The\n\np. 191\n\nself is the witness and the knower, because it is devoid of change. (26).\n\nBy the word "thou" is denoted that which is different from the body, senses,\nmind, life-forces, and ego, and is entirely devoid of the six states * or\nother change. (27).\n\nHaving thus understood the meaning of "thou," one should then contemplate the\nmeaning of "that," both by eliminating what is not \'that\' and by means of\ndirect definitions thereof. (28).\n\nBereft of all taint of phenomenal existence, characterised by phrases like\n"not dense, etc.",\n\np. 192\n\nqualified by non-objectivity, etc., free from the stain of nescience, (29),\n\nBliss unsurpassed, reality, knowledge, and existence by nature, all-\nfilling,--\'that\' is spoken of as the Supreme Self. (30).\n\nUnderstand that to be the Brahman in respect of which the Vedas assert\nomniscience, supreme lordship and omnipotence. (31).\n\nUnderstand that to be the Brahman of which the Vedas explain, by various\nillustrations like clay *, etc., that, by knowing it, all things are known:\n(32).\n\np. 193\n\nUnderstand that to be the Brahman, of which the Vedas enunciate infinitude\nand, to establish it, declare the universe to be the effect of that. * (33).\n\nUnderstand that to he the Brahman which, in the Vedanta, is established, by\nclose reasoning, as the (only) thing to be realised by the aspirants for\nliberation. (34).\n\nUnderstand that to he the Brahman which is spoken of in the Vedas as having\nentered all beings as their souls and controlling them. (35).\n\nUnderstand that to be the Brahman which alone is spoken of in the Vedas as the\nbestower of the reward of actions and the originator of the cause \xe2\x80\xa0 of\nindividual existence. (36).\n\np. 194\n\nThe meanings of the words \'that\' and \'thou\' have been determined. The meaning\nof the sentence will now be dealt with. This sentence-meaning is the identity\nbetween those same two word-meanings. (37)\n\nThe accepted meaning of the sentence, in this case, is neither co-existence\nnor particularisation. The meaning of the sentence, as accepted by the wise,\nis essential identity without reservation. (38).\n\nWhat appears as the inner consciousness is that whose characteristic is\nsecondless bliss, whose nature is secondless bliss, and whose sole definition\nis inner consciousness. (39).\n\np. 195\n\nWhen the mutual identity of the two is thus understood, then only will the\nnon-Brahmanness of the word-meaning \'thou\' be eliminated. (40).\n\nas also the unknownness of the word-meaning of \'that.\' If it be so, what then?\nListen. The inner consciousness remains absolutely as infinite bliss by\nnature. (41).\n\nFurther, a sentence like \'that thou art,\' in order to denote\n[identity](errata.htm#6), proceeds on the basis of the secondary * meaning of\nthe two words \'that\' and \'thou.\' (42).\n\nWe shall carefully explain how the sentence makes its own meaning clear, by\nexcluding the expressed meanings of the two words, which are mixed up. (43).\n\np. 196\n\nThe consciousness, conditioned by the mind, which appears as the connecting\nlink between the idea "I" and the word "I", is expressed by the word "thou".\n(44).\n\nThe first cause of the worlds, conditioned by nescience ( _m aya_),\ncharacterised by omniscience, etc. *, of the nature of reality, etc. \xe2\x80\xa0, and\naffected by non-cognisability, is expressed by the word "that". (45).\n\n(But) cognisability and non-cognisability, having a second and being\n.infinite, are inconsistent in respect of the same thing. Hence is the\nnecessity for the derived (or secondary) meaning. (46).\n\np. 197\n\nWhen the adoption of the primary meaning is inconsistent with other\n(established) proofs, the adoption of a meaning not unconnected with the\nprincipal meaning, is called the derivation of meaning ( _lakshan a_). (47).\n\nThe derivation of meaning, in the case of passages like "that thou art", is a\npartial derivation, and no other as in the case of the words in sentences like\n"This is he". (48).\n\nUntil the sentence-meaning of "I am Brahman" is firmly understood, so long\nshould one possess control of mind, etc., and practise (the expedients of\nhearing, * etc.). (49).\n\nWhen, by the grace of the Vedic teacher, one gets a firm understanding (of the\nabove sentence), then is he entirely free from phenomenal condition and its\ncause. \xe2\x80\xa0 (50).\n\np. 198\n\nAll ends and means destroyed, unconditioned by the elements and the subtler\nbodies, and free from the bonds of action, such a one is immediately\nliberated. (51).\n\nWhen, by the destruction of the bondage of past actions not yet ripe for\nenjoyment, one becomes liberated while living, he remains as such for a short\ntime by virtue of such of his past actions as have brought about his present\nlife. (52).\n\n(Thereafter) he attains absolute liberation without any more birth, which is\nof the nature of unsurpassed bliss and is known as the supreme abode of\nVishnu. (53).\n\n\n\nHere ends the Commentary on the Text.\n\n_____\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[184:*](wos09.htm#fr_166) See footnote on page [86](wos07.htm#page_86).\n\n[191:*](wos09.htm#fr_167) Birth, existence, growth, maturity, decay, and\ndeath.\n\n[192:*](wos09.htm#fr_168) By knowing clay, all clay things like pot, etc., are\nknown.\n\n[193:*](wos09.htm#fr_169) i.e., Brahman is the cause of the universe.\n\n[193:\xe2\x80\xa0](wos09.htm#fr_170) _M aya_ or nescience.\n\n[195:*](wos09.htm#fr_171) _Lakshya_ , secondary, indirect or derived, as\nopposed to _v achya_, primary, direct or expressed.\n\n[196:*](wos09.htm#fr_172) Omniscience, omnipotence, omnipresence.\n\n[196:\xe2\x80\xa0](wos09.htm#fr_173) Reality, knowledge, infinity.\n\n[197:*](wos09.htm#fr_174) Hearing, meditation and concentration.\n\n[197:\xe2\x80\xa0](wos09.htm#fr_175) Nescience or _m aya_.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Definition of One\'s Own Self](wos10.htm)\n\n'
