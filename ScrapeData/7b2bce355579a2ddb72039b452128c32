Verily, by means of the Varu _n_ apraghasa _h_ Pra _g_ apati\ndelivered the creatures from Varu _n_ a\'s noose; and those creatures of his\nwere born without disease and blemish. Now with these Sakamedha offerings,--\ntherewith indeed the gods slew V _ri_ tra, therewith they gained that supreme\nauthority which they now wield; and so does he now therewith slay his wicked,\nspiteful enemy and gain the victory: this is why he performs these offerings\nin the fourth month (after the Varu _n_ apraghasa _h_ ). He performs them on\ntwo successive days.\n\n2:5:3:22\\. On the first day he offers a cake on eight potsherds to Agni\nAnikavat 2. For it was after\n\np. 409\n\nshaping Agni into a sharp point 1, that the gods rushed forward, intent on\nslaying V _ri_ tra; and that sharp point, Agni, swerved not. And so does he\n(the Sacrificer) now rush forward, after shaping Agni into a sharp point,\nintent on slaying his wicked, spiteful enemy; and that sharp point, Agni,\nswerves not: this is why he sacrifices to Agni Anikavat.\n\n2:5:3:33\\. Thereupon, at midday, he offers a potful of boiled grain ( _k_ aru)\nto the Maruts, the Scorchers (Santapana _h_ ), for at midday indeed the\nscorching winds scorched V _ri_ tra; and thus scorched he lay panting and\ngasping, being rent all over. And so do the scorching winds scorch his (the\nSacrificer\'s) wicked, spiteful enemy: hence (he sacrifices) to the Maruts, the\nScorchers.\n\n2:5:3:44\\. Thereupon, (in the evening, he offers a potful of boiled grain) to\nthe Maruts, the Householders (G _ri_ hamedhina _h_ ). That pap he cooks after\ndriving\n\np. 410\n\naway the calves (from the cows) with the (pala _s_ a-) branch, and having (all\nthe cows) milked into the pot containing the strainers. Now, whenever (in\npreparing the pap) they use (whole) rice-grains, then that is a _k_ aru: this\nnourishment 1 the gods took when they were about to slay V _ri_ tra on the\nmorrow; and so does he (the Sacrificer) now take that nourishment, being about\nto slay his wicked, spiteful enemy. The reason, then, why it is milk-pap, is\nthat milk is nourishment, and rice-grains are nourishment, and that he thus\nputs into him (atman) that twofold nourishment. For this reason it is a rice-\npap (prepared) with milk.\n\n2:5:3:55\\. The practice, in regard to this (pap, is as follows). The same\naltar covered (with sacrificial grass) which served for the (oblation to) the\nMaruts, the Scorchers, is (now used) 2. Near this covered altar they lay down\nthe enclosing-sticks and pieces of wood. Having had (the cows) milked in the\nsame way (as before), he (the Adhvaryu) cooks the pap; and having cooked it\nand basted it with butter, he removes it from the fire.\n\n2:5:3:66\\. They then rinse either two plates or two dishes, and put that (pap)\nthereon in two equal\n\np. 411\n\nparts. Having then made a hollow in each (pap), he (the Adhvaryu) pours\nclarified butter therein, and wipes both the dipping-spoon and the offering-\nspoon. Thereupon he takes the two dishes of pap, and walks up (to the altar);\nand again, he takes the dipping and offering spoons, and walks up; and having\ntouched 1 the covered altar, and laid the enclosing-sticks round (the fire) 2,\nhe puts on as many pieces of firewood as he thinks fit. He then deposits those\ntwo dishes of pap, and the dipping and offering spoons, in their places\n(outside the altar). The Hot _ri_ sits down on the Hot _ri_ \'s seat. Taking\nthe dipping and offering spoons, he (the Adhvaryu) says,--\n\n2:5:3:77\\. \'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni!\' with reference to Agni\'s\nbutter-portion. He then takes four \'cuttings\' of butter from the hollow of the\nsouthern pap, and steps over (to the south side of the fire). Having stepped\nover, and called for the (\xc3\x82gnidhra\'s) \' _S_ rausha _t_ ,\' he says (to the Hot\n_ri_ ), \'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Agni!\' and pours out the oblation,\nas soon as the Vashat has been uttered.\n\n2:5:3:88\\. He then says, \'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Soma!\' with\nreference to Soma\'s butter-portion. He then takes four cuttings of butter from\nthe hollow of the northern pap, and steps over. Having stepped over and called\nfor the \' _S_ rausha _t_ ,\' he says, \'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Soma!\'\nand pours out the oblation, as soon as the Vasha _t_ has been uttered.\n\n2:5:3:99\\. He then says, \'Pronounce the invitatory prayer\n\np. 412\n\nto the Maruts, the Householders!\' He makes an \'under-layer\' of butter (in the\noffering-spoon) from the hollow of the southern pap, takes two cuttings from\nthe latter, pours some butter thereon, and steps across. Having stepped across\nand called for the \' _S_ rausha _t_ ,\' he says, \'Pronounce the offering-prayer\nto the Maruts, the Householders!\' and pours out the oblation as soon as the\nVashat has been uttered.\n\n2:5:3:1010\\. He then says, \'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni Svish _t_\nak _ri_ t 1!\' He makes an under-layer of butter from the hollow of the\nnorthern pap, takes two cuttings from the latter, pours some butter thereon,\nand steps across. Having stepped across and called for the \' _S_ rausha _t_ ,\'\nhe says, \'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t!\' and\npours out the oblation as soon as the Vashat has been uttered. Thereupon he\ncuts off the I _d_ a 2, but no fore-portion 3. Having invoked (the I _d_ a),\nthey cleanse themselves. This is one mode of performance.\n\n2:5:3:1111\\. Then there is this other. The same altar covered (with\nsacrificial grass) which has served for the Maruts, the Scorchers, is (used\nnow). Near this covered altar they lay down the enclosing-sticks and pieces of\nfirewood; and having had (the cows) milked in the same way (as before) he\ncooks the rice-pap. The butter he puts on so as to be no mere accessory 4\nHaving cooked (the pap) and basted\n\np. 413\n\nit, and removed it (from the fire), he anoints it. He then removes the butter\nin the pot (from the fire), and wipes the dipping and offering spoons.\nThereupon, taking the dish with the pap, he walks up (to the altar); and\nagain, taking the butter in the pot, he walks up; and again, taking the\ndipping and offering spoons, he walks up (to the altar). He then touches that\ncovered altar, lays the enclosing-sticks round (the \xc3\x82havaniya fire), and puts\non as many pieces of wood as he thinks fit. He then deposits successively 1\n(in their respective places) the dish with the pap, the pot with butter, and\nthe dipping and offering spoons. The Hot _ri_ sits down in the Hot _ri_ \'s\nseat. Taking the dipping and offering spoons, he (the Adhvaryu) says,--\n\n2:5:3:1212\\. \'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni!\' with a view to\n(offering) Agni\'s butter-portion. He then takes four \'cuttings\' of butter from\nthe pot and steps across (to the offering-place on the south side of the\nfire). Having stepped across and called for the (\xc3\x82gnidhra\'s) _S_ rausha _t_ ,\nhe says (to the Hot _ri_ ), \'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Agni!\' and pours\nout the oblation, as soon as the Vasha _t_ has been uttered.\n\n2:5:3:1313\\. He then says, \'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Soma!\' with a\nview to Soma\'s butter-portion. He then takes four cuttings of butter from the\npot, and steps across. Having stepped\n\np. 414\n\nacross, and called for the _S_ rausha _t_ , he says, \'Pronounce the offering-\nformula to Soma!\' and pours out the oblation, as soon as the Vashat has been\nuttered.\n\n2:5:3:1414\\. Thereupon he says, \'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to the\nMaruts, the Householders!\' He then makes an \'under-layer\' of butter (in the\n_g_ uhu), takes two cuttings from that pap, pours some butter thereon, re-\nanoints (replenishes with butter the parts of the sacrificial dish from which\nhe has made) 1 the two cuttings, and steps across (to the offering-place).\nHaving stepped across and called for the _S_ rausha _t_ , he says, \'Pronounce\nthe offering-prayer to the Maruts, the Householders!\' and pours out the\noblation, as soon as the Vashat has been uttered.\n\n2:5:3:1515\\. Thereupon he says, \'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni Svish\n_t_ ak _ri_ t!\' He then makes an under-layer of butter, takes one cutting from\nthe pap, pours twice butter thereon, without, however, re-anointing the (place\nof the) cutting; and steps across. Having stepped across, and called for the\n_S_ rausha _t_ , he says, \'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Agni Svish _t_ ak\n_ri_ t!\' and pours out the oblation, as soon as the Vashat has been uttered.\n\n2:5:3:1616, He then cuts off the I _d_ a, but no fore-portion. Having invoked\n(the I _d_ a), they (the priests) eat it. As many members of (the\nsacrificer\'s) household as are entitled to partake of the remains of\nsacrificial\n\np. 415\n\nfood 1 may eat (of the pap); or the officiating priests may eat it; or, if\nthere be abundant pap, other Brahmans also may eat of it. The pot having then\nbeen covered, before it is quite emptied, they put it away in a safe place,\nfor the \'full-spoon ceremony.\' Thereupon they let the calves together with\ntheir mothers; and thus the cattle take that nourishment. That night he\nperforms the Agnihotra with rice-gruel. In the morning they milk a cow, which\nsuckles an adopted calf 2, for the purpose of the offering to the fathers.\n\n2:5:3:1717\\. Thereupon, in the morning, either after or before the performance\nof the Agnihotra--whichever he pleases--he cuts out (the remaining rice-pap)\nwith the darvi-spoon 3 from the un-emptied pot, with the text (Va _g_. S. III,\n49), \'Full, O spoon, fly away, well filled fly back to us!\n\np. 416\n\n[paragraph continues] O thou (Indra), of a hundredfold powers, let us two\nbarter food and drink, like wares!\' In like manner as an invitatory prayer (is\nused at offerings) so does he by this (verse) invite him (Indra) to that\nshare.\n\n2:5:3:1818\\. Let him then tell (the Sacrificer) to make a bull roar. \'If it\nroars,\' say some, \'then that (sound) is the Vashat; let him offer after that\nVashat.\' And in this way indeed he calls Indra in his own form to the slaying\nof V _ri_ tra 1; for the bull is indeed Indra\'s form: hence he thereby calls\nIndra in his own form to the slaying of V _ri_ tra. If it roars, then one may\nknow that Indra has come to his sacrifice, that his sacrifice is with Indra.\nAnd should it not roar, let the priest, seated on the south side (viz. the\nBrahman), say, \'Sacrifice!\'--this, indeed, is Indra\'s voice.\n\n2:5:3:1919\\. He offers with the text (Va _g_. S. III, 50), \'Give unto me,\n(and) I give unto thee. Bestow (gifts) on me, (and) I bestow on thee 2! And\nmayest thou give me guerdon, (and) I will give thee guerdon! Svaha!\'\n\n2:5:3:2020\\. He then offers a cake on seven potsherds to the sportive (Kridina\n_h_ ) Maruts. For when Indra went forward in order to slay V _ri_ tra, the\nsportive Maruts were sporting around him singing his praises; and even so do\nthey sport around this (Sacrificer), singing his praises, now that he is about\nto slay his wicked, spiteful enemy: this\n\np. 417\n\nis why (he sacrifices) to the sportive Maruts 1. Thereupon (follows the\nperformance) of the Great Oblation (Maha-havis): this (performance) is in\naccordance with that of the great (seasonable) oblation 2.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[408:1](sbe1258.htm#fr_913) The performance of the Sakamedha offerings\nrequires two days. In the first place--after the \xc3\x82havaniya has been \'taken\nout\' from the Garhapatya--both fires are taken up by means of (or \'made to\nmount\') the two kindling-sticks, and transferred (by \'churning out\') to\nanother altar (the uttaravedi). On the first day oblations are then made to\nAgni Anikavat, the Maruta _h_ Santapana _h_ and the Maruto G _ri_ hamedhina\n_h_ , these being completed on the next morning by a Darvihoma to Indra, and\nan oblation of cake to the Maruta _h_ Kri _d_ ina _h_. Then follows the\nMahahavis, consisting--besides the five constant oblations--of oblations to\nIndra-Agni, Mahendra, and Vi _s_ vakarman. In the afternoon takes place the\nMahapit _ri_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, or (Great) sacrifice to the Manes (performed on a\nspecial altar and fire-place, south of the Dakshi _n_ agi); which is succeeded\nby the Traiyambakahoma, or offering to Rudra Tryambaka, performed on a cross-\nway somewhere north of the sacrificial ground.\n\n[408:2](sbe1258.htm#fr_914) That is, Agni, the \'sharp-pointed\' or \'sharp-\nedged;\' an epithet apparently referring to the pointed flames or tongues of.\nAgni. The St. Petersburg Dict. takes it to mean \'Agni, possessed of a face.\'\nPerhaps it may mean, \'Agni, constituting the front or van of the army.\' In _S_\nat. Br. III, 4, 4, 14, Agni is likened to the point (anika) of the\nthunderbolt, Soma to its shaft ( _s_ akya), and Vish _n_ u p. 409 to the part\nwhere the point is fixed on the shaft (kulmala). Compare the corresponding\npassage in Taitt. Br. I, 6, 6: \'The gods and Asuras were contending. Agni\nspake, "My body is anikavat (possessed of an army, acc. to Saya _n_ a):\nsatisfy it and you will overcome the Asuras!" The gods prepared a cake on\neight potsherds for Agni Anikavat. Agni Anikavat, being pleased with his\nshare, produced for himself four anikas; and thereby the gods prevailed and\nthe Asuras were defeated. . . . Now Agni Anikavat is yonder sun: his rays are\nthe anikas.\' Here anika would rather seem to mean either \'dart or \'face.\' [In\nTaitt. Br. I, 6, 2, 5, in the battle between the gods and Asuras, Agni is\nrepresented as the mukham of the gods, which Saya _n_ a takes to mean the\n\'van-guard\' or \'the champion\' of the gods. Compare also _S_ at. Br. II, 6, 4,\n2; XI, 5, 2, 4]. Acc. to the Black Ya _g_ us, the cake to Agni Anikavat is to\nbe prepared (or offered) simultaneously (sakam) with the rising of the sun;\nwhence is probably derived the term \'Sakam-edha.\'\n\n[409:1](sbe1258.htm#fr_915) I.e. into a sharp-pointed weapon; or, perhaps,\n\'after appointing Agni their leader.\' Cf. [p. 449](sbe1262.htm#page_449) note;\nand _S_ at. Br. V, 3, 1, I.\n\n[410:1](sbe1258.htm#fr_916) That is, strengthening food. Instead of medhas,\nthe Ka _n_ va recension has throughout medham (as once in our text).\n\n[410:2](sbe1258.htm#fr_917) At the preceding offering, that to the Maruta _h_\nSantapana _h_ , the ish _t_ i is either to be interrupted at the end of the\nSamish _t_ aya _g_ us (see I, 9, 2, 25-28), or only the offering of the Barhis\n(I, 9, 2, 29-31) is to be omitted. The concluding ceremonies are to be\nperformed either on the same day, after the offering to the Maruto G _ri_\nhamedhina _h_ \\--which itself concludes with the I _d_ a, and (acc. to Taitt.\nBr. I, 6, 6, 6) has neither fore-offerings nor after-offerings--or the\nfollowing morning after the Darvihoma (see par. 17). Katy. V, 6, 3-5, 2-33.\n\n[411:1](sbe1258.htm#fr_918) According to Katy. V, 6, 14, he is to do so either\nsilently, or with the text (Va _g_. S. II, 2) used in spreading the\nsacrificial grass on the altar. See I, 3, 3, 11.\n\n[411:2](sbe1258.htm#fr_919) See I, 3, 3, 13; 3, 4, 1 seq.\n\n[412:1](sbe1258.htm#fr_920) See I, 7, 3, 1 seq.\n\n[412:2](sbe1258.htm#fr_921) See I, 8, 1, 1 seq.\n\n[412:3](sbe1258.htm#fr_922) See I, 7, 4, 6 seq.\n\n[412:4](sbe1258.htm#fr_923) Ned eva prative _s_ am a _g_ yam adhi _s_ rayati.\nThere seems to be some mistake here. The commentary on Katy. V, 6, 6 has \'tad\neva\' instead of \'ned eva.\' Saya _n_ a says that the butter is put on the\nDakshi _n_ agni; but according to Katy. V, 6, 24, it is put on the fire\ntogether with the pap. The Ka _n_ va text has, abhyardha a _g_ ya _m_ p. 413\nsthalyam adhi _s_ rayati, \'he puts on the butter in the pot on the near side.\'\n\n[413:1](sbe1258.htm#fr_924) In the original this is expressed by repetition of\nthe verb, as was the case in the last sentence but one, where the original\nconstruction is retained. The Ka _n_ va text has merely, \'Having taken (the\npap) with the dish, he hastes up (udadravati).\'\n\n[414:1](sbe1258.htm#fr_925) \'Pratyanakti\' is probably the same as\n\'pratyabhigharayati,\' generally applied to the basting of the avadana-sthana,\nor that part of the havis from whence the cuttings have been made (Katy. I, 9,\nII; the \'replenishing\' of the havis in _S_ at. Br. I, 7, 3, 6 refers to the\nsame thing). See, however, Katy. V, 6, 22, where it is ruled that no\npratyabhighara _n_ a is to take place at the present sacrifice. The Ka _n_ va\nMS., on the other hand, reads, \'he does not re-anoint the two cuttings.\'\nPerhaps he is to anoint separately the two cut-off pieces.\n\n[415:1](sbe1258.htm#fr_926) That is, those who have been invested with the\nsacrificial cord. According to Taitt. Br. I, 6, 7, 1 the mistress of the house\nis not to eat of it, but an additional (prative _s_ a) pap is to be cooked\nspecially for her on the Dakshi _n_ a fire.\n\n[415:2](sbe1258.htm#fr_927) \'In the morning they tie up the (adopted) calf of\na nivanya (cow suckling a strange calf),\' Ka _n_ va text.\n\n[415:3](sbe1258.htm#fr_928) The Darvi-homa, or oblation of a darvi-spoonful of\nboiled rice to Indra, the associate of the Maruts, may be considered as part\nof the G _ri_ hamedhiya ish _t_ i, being, as it were, an offering of remains\n(or scrapings, nishkasa, Taitt. Br. I, 6, 7, 3); cf. Katy. V, 6, 33. Like all\n_G_ uhoti-offerings, the darvi-homa is performed by the Adhvaryu while seated\non the north side of the fire. According to Taitt. Br. I, 6, 7, 3, it is to be\noffered in the Garhapatya, but according to Katy. V, 6, 38 (comm.) in the\n\xc3\x82havaniya. If the concluding ceremonies of the Santapaniya ish _t_ i (from the\noffering of the Barhis) have not already been performed on the previous night,\nthey have to be performed after the conclusion of the darvi-homa. If, however,\nonly the offering of the Barhis was then omitted, the darvi-homa, if performed\nbefore the Agnihotra, is followed immediately by that oblation.\n\n[416:1](sbe1258.htm#fr_929) On the symbolic connection of the seasonal\nofferings, especially the Sakamedha _h_ , with the slaying of V _ri_ tra, the\nevil spirit of drought, see II, 6, 4, 1.\n\n[416:2](sbe1258.htm#fr_930) According to Mahidhara, this first line is spoken\nby Indra to his worshipper; the second line containing the latter\'s reply.\n\n[417:1](sbe1258.htm#fr_931) Comp. Taitt. Br. I, 6, 7, 4: When Indra had slain\nV _ri_ tra (with the thunderbolt) he went to the farthest distances, thinking\nthat he had missed (his aim). He said, \'Who will know this\' [viz. whether V\n_ri_ tra is really dead or not, comm.]? The Maruts said, \'We will choose a\nboon, then we will know (find it out): let the first oblation be prepared for\nus!\' They sported (danced about) on him (V _ri_ tra, and thereby found out\nthat he was dead).\n\n[417:2](sbe1258.htm#fr_932) That is to say, the Maha-havis, or Great Oblation,\nthough apparently only an integral part of the Sakamedha _h_ , is in reality\nits chief ceremony, and may therefore be considered as being itself on a par\nwith the other seasonal offerings; hence it requires the five oblations common\nto all the _K_ aturmasyas; see II, 5, 1, 8-11. The Black Ya _g_ us it seems\ndoes not use the term Maha-havis, but assigns more importance to the Maha-pit\n_ri_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a (see II, 6, 1, 1 seq.). See \xc3\x82pastamba\'s Paribhashas, 80, 81\n(M. Muller, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morg. Ges. IX), according to which the\nsacrifice to the Manes belongs to the Mahaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 5, 4. Fourth Brahma _n_ a](sbe1259.htm)\n\n'
