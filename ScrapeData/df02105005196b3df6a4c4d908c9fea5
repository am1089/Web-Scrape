Let a man meditate on mind as Brahman (n.), this is said with reference to\nthe body. Let a man meditate on the ether as Brahman (n.), this is said with\nreference to the Devas. Thus both the meditation which has reference to the\nbody, and the meditation which has reference to the Devas, has been taught.\n\n2\\. That Brahman (mind) has four feet (quarters).\n\np. 54\n\n[paragraph continues] Speech is one foot, breath is one foot, the eye is one\nfoot, the car is one foot-so much with reference to the body. Then with\nreference to the gods, Agni (fire) is one foot, Vayu (air) is one foot, \xc3\x82ditya\n(sun) is one foot, the quarters are one foot. Thus both the worship which has\nreference to the body, and the worship which has reference to the Devas, has\nbeen taught.\n\n3\\. Speech is indeed the fourth foot of Brahman. That foot shines with Agni\n(fire) as its light, and warms. He who knows this, shines and warms through\nhis celebrity, fame, and glory of countenance.\n\n4\\. Breath is indeed the fourth foot of Brahman. That foot shines with Vayu\n(air) as its light, and warms. He who knows this, shines and warms through his\ncelebrity, fame, and glory of countenance.\n\n5\\. The eye is indeed the fourth foot of Brahman. That foot shines with \xc3\x82ditya\n(sun) as its light, and warms. He who knows this, shines and warms through his\ncelebrity, fame, and glory of countenance.\n\n6\\. The ear is indeed the fourth foot of Brahman. That foot shines with the\nquarters as its light, and warms. He who knows this, shines and warms through\nhis celebrity, fame, and glory of countenance.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[53:3](sbe01076.htm#fr_191) This is a further elucidation of _Kh_. Up.
