If, on account of its being a word denoting an effect, (anandamaya be\nsaid) not (to denote the highest Self); (we say) no, on account of abundance.\n\nWe deny the conclusion of the Purvapakshin, on the ground of there being\nabundance of bliss in the highest Brahman, and 'abundance' being one of the\npossible meanings of -maya.--Since bliss such as described in the Taitt. Up.--\nbliss which is reached by successively multiplying by hundred all inferior\nkinds of bliss--cannot belong to the individual soul, we conclude that it\nbelongs to Brahman; and as Brahman cannot be an effect, and as -maya. may have\nthe sense of 'abounding in,' we conclude that the anandamaya is Brahman\nitself; inner contradiction obliging us to set aside that sense of -maya which\nis recommended by regard to 'consequence' and frequency of usage. The regard\nfor consistency, moreover, already has to be set aside in the case of the 'pra\n_n_ amaya'; for in that term -maya\n\np. 232\n\ncannot denote 'made of.' The 'pra _n_ amaya' Self can only be called by that\nname in so far as air with its five modifications has (among others) the\nmodification called pra _n_ a, i.e. breathing out, or because among the five\nmodifications or functions of air pra _n_ a is the 'abounding,' i.e.\nprevailing one.--Nor can it be truly said that -maya is but rarely used in the\nsense of 'abounding in': expressions such as 'a sacrifice abounding in food'\n(annamaya), 'a procession with many carriages' ( _s_ aka _t_ amayi), are by no\nmeans uncommon.--Nor can we admit that to call something 'abounding in bliss'\nimplies the presence of _some_ pain. For 'abundance' precludes paucity on the\npart of that which is said to abound, but does not imply the presence of what\nis contrary. The presence or absence of what is contrary has to be ascertained\nby other means of proof; and in our case we do ascertain the absence of what\nis contrary to bliss by such means, viz. the clause 'free from evil,' &c.\nAbundance of bliss on the part of Brahman certainly implies a relation to\npaucity on the part of some other bliss; and in accordance with this demand\nthe text says 'That is one measure of human bliss,' &c. (II, 8, 1). The bliss\nof Brahman is of measureless abundance, compared to the bliss of the\nindividual soul.--Nor can it be maintained that the individual soul may be\nviewed as being an effect of bliss. For that a soul whose essential nature is\nknowledge and bliss should in any way be changed into something else, as a\nlump of clay is made into a pot, is an assumption contradicted by all\nscripture, sacred tradition, and reasoning. That in the Sa _m_ sara state the\nsoul's bliss and knowledge are contracted owing to karman will be shown later\non.--The Self of bliss therefore is other than the individual soul; it is\nBrahman itself.\n\nA further reason for this conclusion is supplied by the next Sutra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 15.
