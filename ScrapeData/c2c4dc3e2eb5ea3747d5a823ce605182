I have heard in the discourse on Savitri and Yama\nabout the Formless Devi Mula Prakriti and the glories of Savitri, all true and\nleading to the endless good. Now I want to hear the story of the Devi Lak _s_\nmi. O Thou, the Chief of the knowers of the Vedas! What is the nature of Lak\n_s_ mi? By whom was She first worshipped? and by what Mantra? Kindly describe\nHer glories to me.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n4-33. Naraya _n_ a said :-- Of old, in the beginning of the Prakritik\nCreation, from the left side of Kri _sn_ a, the Supreme Spirit, appeared in\nthe Rasama _nd_ alam (the Figure Dance) a Devi. She looked exceedingly\nhandsome, of a dark blue colour, of spacious hips, of thin waist, and\n\n\n\np. 958\n\n\n\nwith high breast, looking twelve years old, of steady youth, of a colour of\nwhite Champaka flower and very lovely. The beauty of Her face throws under\nshade millions and millions of autumnal full moons. Before Her wide expanded\neyes, the midday lotus of the autumnal season becomes highly ashamed. By the\nWill of God, this Devi suddenly divided Herself into two parts. The two looked\nequal in every respect; whether in beauty, qualities, age, loveliness, colour,\nbody, spirit, dress, ornaments, smile, glance, love, or humanity, they were\nperfectly equal.\n\n\n\nNow she who appeared from the right side is named Radha and she who came from\nthe left side is named Maha Lak _s_ mi. Radha wanted first the two armed S\xc2\x92ri\nKri _sn_ a, Who was Higher than the highest; then Maha Lak _s_ mi wanted Him.\nRadha came out of the right side and wanted first Kri _sn_ a; so Kri _sn_ a,\ntoo, divided himself at once into two parts. From His right side came out the\ntwo-armed and from his left side came out the four-armed. The two-armed person\nfirst made over to Maha Lak _s_ mi the four armed One; then the two armed\nPerson Himself took Radha. Lak _s_ mi looks on the whole universe with a\ncooling eye; hence She is named Lak _s_ mi and as She is great, She is called\nMaha Lak _s_ mi. And for that reason the Lord of Radha is two-armed and the\nLord of Lak _s_ mi is four-armed. Radha is pure Apra kritic S\xc2\x92uddha Sattva (of\nthe nature of pure Sattva Gu _n_ a, the illuminating attribute) and surrounded\nby the Gopas and Gopis. The four-armed Puru _s_ a, on the other hand, took Lak\n_s_ mi (Padma) to Vaiku _nt_ ha. The two-armed person is Kri _sn_ a; and the\nfour-armed is Naraya _n_ a. They are equal in all respects. Maha Lak _s_ mi\nbecame many by Her Yogic powers (i.e., She remained in full in Vaiku _nt_ ha\nand assumed many forms in parts). Maha Lak _s_ mi of Vaiku _nt_ ha is full, of\npure Sattva Gu _n_ a, and endowed with all sorts of wealth and prosperity. She\nis the crest of woman-kind as far as loving one\xc2\x92s husbands is concerned. She\nis the Svarga Lak _s_ mi in the Heavens; the Naga Lak _s_ mi of the serpents,\nthe Nagas, in the nether regions; the Raja Lak _s_ mi of the kings and the\nHousehold Lak _s_ mi of the householders. She resides in the houses of house-\nholders as prosperity and the most auspicious of all good things. She is the\nprogenetrix, She is the Surabhi of cows and She is the Dak _s_ i _n_ a (the\nsacrificial fee) in sacrifices. She is the daughter of the milk ocean and she\nis Padmini, the beauty of the spheres of the Moon and the Sun. She is the\nlustre and beauty of the ornaments, gems, fruits, water, kings, queens,\nheavenly women, of all the houses, grains, clothings, cleansed places, images,\nauspicious jars, pearls, jewels, crest of jewels, garlands, diamonds, milk,\nsandal, beautiful twigs, fresh rain cloud, or of all other colours. She was\nfirst worhipped in Vaiku _nt_ ha by Naraya _n_ a. Next She was worshipped by\nBrahma and then\n\n\n\np. 959\n\n\n\nby S\xc2\x92ankara with devotion. She was worshipped by Vi _sn_ u in the K _s_ hirode\nSamudra. Then she was worshipped by Svayambhuva Manu, then by Indras amongst\nmen, then by Munis, Ri _s_ is, good householders, by the Gandharbas, in the\nGandharbaloka; by the Nagas in the Nagaloka. She was worshipped with devotion\nby Brahma for one fortnight commencing from the bright eighth day in the month\nof Bhadra and ending on the eighth day of the dark fortnight in the three-\nworlds. She was worshipped by Vi _sn_ u, with devotion in the three worlds on\nthe meritorious Tuesday in the months of Pau _s_ a, Chaitra, and Bhadra. Manu,\nalso, worshipped Her on the Pau _s_ a Sankranti (the last day of the month of\nPau _s_ a when the Sun enters another sign) and on the auspicious Tuesday in\nthe month of Magha. Thus the worship of Maha Lak _s_ mi is made prevalent in\nthe three worlds. She was worshipped by Indra, the Lord of the Devas and by\nMangala (Mars) on Tuesday. She was then worshipped by Kedara, Nila, Subala,\nDhruva, Uttanapada, S\xc2\x92akra, Bali, Kas\xc2\x92yapa, Dak _s_ a, Kardama, Surya,\nPriyavrata, Chandra, Vayu, Kuvera, Varu _n_ a, Yama, Hutasana and others. Thus\nHer worship extended by and by to all the places. She is the Presiding Deity\nof all wealth; so She is the wealth of all.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Thirty-ninth Chapter of the Ninth Book on the story of Maha Lak\n_s_ mi in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 40](bk09ch40.htm)\n\n'
