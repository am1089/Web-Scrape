Thee who hidest thyself in secret like a\nthief with an animal [2](sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:1:2) (which he has stolen)--who\nhadst harnessed [3](sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:1:3) adoration and carriedst\nadoration--\n\n2\\. The wise unanimously followed by thy foot-marks\n[1](sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:2:1). All (gods) deserving worship (reverentially)\nsat down near thee.\n\n3\\. The gods followed the laws of _Ri_ ta. There was an encompassing as the\nheaven (encompasses) the earth [1](sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:3:1).\n\n4\\. In the lap, in the womb of _Ri_ ta, the waters nourish the fine child with\npraise, him who is well born.\n\n5\\. Like good fortune, like a broad abode, like the fertile hill\n[1](sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:5:1), like the refreshing stream,\n\n6\\. Like a racer urged forward in the race, like the rapids of the Sindhu\n[1](sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:6:1)--who can hold him back?\n\n7\\. (He is) the kinsman of the rivers, as a brother of his sisters. He eats\nthe forests as a king (eats, i. e. takes the wealth of) the rich\n[1](sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:7:1).\n\n8\\. When he has spread through the forests, driven by the wind, Agni shears\nthe hair of the earth.\n\n9\\. Sitting in the waters he hisses like a swan. (He is) most famous by his\npower of mind, he who belongs to the clans, awakening at dawn--\n\n10\\. A performer of worship like Soma, the god born from _Ri_ ta, like a young\n(?) [1](sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:10:1) beast, far-extending, far-shining.\n\np. 55\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe authorship of the whole collection, I, 65-73, is ascribed to Para _s_ ara\n_S_ aktya. These hymns are addressed exclusively to Agni. The greater part of\nthem (65-70) is composed in the Vira _g_ metre; comp. on this metre my\nProlegomena, 95 seq. I have given there my reasons for considering that each\nverse consists of twenty, not of forty syllables.\n\nThis section ascribed to Para _s_ ara has been treated of by Bollensen,\nZeitschrift der D. Morg. Gesellschaft, XXII, 569 seq. No verse of these hymns\ncomposed in the metre Dvipada Vira _g_ (I, 65-70) occurs in the other Sa _m_\nhitas.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Professor Max Muller proposes the following translation for verses 1\nand 2: The wise (gods) together followed thee (Agni) when in hiding, by means\nof footsteps, as one follows a thief by the animal; they followed thee who\naccepts and carries adoration (to the gods). All the worshipful gods sat down\n(reverentially) near thee.\n\nNote 2. There is no reason for reading with Bartholomae (Studien zur\nindogermanischen Sprachgeschichte, I, 48) pa _s_ va\xc2\xb4n (gen. plur.) na tayum.\n\nNote 3. Ludwig proposes yuvanam, which is quite unnecessary.--See also\nGaedicke, 173.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. We have here the well-known myth of the hidden Agni discovered by the\ngods. The \'wise ones,\' (dhi\xc2\xb4ra _h_ ) are no doubt the searching gods, the same\nwho are called ya _g_ atra _h_ in the last Pada, and who are expressly\ndesignated as deva\xc2\xb4 _h_ in verse 3. Comp. Bergaigne, I, 110.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Regarding the construction, see Gaedicke, 192.--Professor Max Muller\'s\nopinion on this phrase differs from\n\np. 56\n\nmine. He writes: \'I should prefer parish _t_ i. But parish _t_ i seems to mean\na running about, reconnoitring, searching. "There was searching on earth as in\nheaven," lit. earth, like heaven, was reconnoitring-ground.\'\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Comp. VIII, 50, 2. giri _h_ na bhu _g_ ma\xc2\xb4. I believe that Boehtlingk-\nRoth, Bollensen, and Grassmann are right in correcting our passage\naccordingly; ra _n_ va\xc2\xb4, p _ri_ thvi\xc2\xb4, _s_ ambhu follow the gender of the\ncorresponding substantives, and the same may be expected here. Comp. Lanman,\n530. The meaning is that Agni yields nourishment to all beings as a mountain\nfertilises the country by the waters which come down from it; comp. VIII, 49,\n2. gire _h_ iva pra rasa _h_ asya pinvire datra _n_ i purubao _g_ asa _h_.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Regarding the construction, comp. Gaedicke, 252 seq.; Bergaigne,\nMelanges Renier, 95. Joh. Schmidt (Die Pluralbildungen der indogerm. Neutra,\n305) and Ludwig (V, 524) are wrong in taking kshoda _h_ as a locative or as an\ninstrumental respectively.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. Comp. Pischel-Geldner, Vedische Studien, I, p. xvi.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. Can _s_ i _s_ va be the nominative of a stem _s_ i _s_ van which\nstands by the side of _s_ i _s_ u as _r i_bhvan of _ri_ bhu? Prof. Max Muller\nproposes: \'Large like a cow with young, like a pregnant cow.\'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 66](sbe46016.htm)\n\n'
