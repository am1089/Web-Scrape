The 'two entered into the cave' are the two Selfs; on account of this\nbeing seen.\n\nThe two, entered into the cave and drinking their reward, are neither the\nembodied soul together with the vital breath, nor the embodied soul together\nwith the buddhi; it is rather the embodied Self and the highest Self which are\ndesignated by those terms. For this is seen, i.e. it is seen that in that\nsection the individual Self and the highest Self only are spoken of as entered\ninto the cave. To the highest Self there refers I, 2, 12, 'The wise who by\nmeditation on his Self recognises the Ancient who is difficult to see, who has\nentered into the dark, who is hidden in the cave, who dwells in the abyss, as\nGod, he indeed leaves joy and sorrow far behind.' And to the individual soul\nthere refers I ,4, 7, 'Who is together with the vital breath, who is Aditi,\nwho is made of the deities, who entering into the cave abides therein, who was\nborn variously through the elements.' Aditi here means the individual soul\nwhich enjoys (atti) the fruits of its works; which is associated with the\nvital breath; which is made of the deities, i.e. whose enjoyment is dependent\non the different sense-organs; which abides in the hollow of the heart; and\nwhich, being connected with the elementary substances, earth, and so on, is\nborn in various forms--human, divine, &c.--That the text speaks of the two\nSelfs as drinking their reward (while actually the individual soul only does\nso) is to be understood in the same way as the phrase 'there go the umbrella-\nbearers' (one of whom only carries the umbrella). Or else we may account for\nthis on the ground that both are agents with regard to the drinking, in so far\nas the 'drinking' individual soul is caused to drink by the highest Self.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 12.
