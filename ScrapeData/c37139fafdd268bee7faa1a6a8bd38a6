Up he raised  \nHis awful head with eyes that blazed  \nLike comets, dire as Death in form  \nWho threats the worlds with fire and storm.  \nThe giants pointed to their stores  \nOf buffaloes and deer and boars,  \nAnd straight he gorged him with a flood  \nOf wine, with marrow, flesh, and blood.  \nHe ceased: the giants ventured near  \nAnd bent their lowly heads in fear.  \nThen Kumbhakarna glared with eyes  \nStill heavy in their first surprise,  \nStill drowsy from his troubled rest,  \nAnd thus the giant band addressed.  \n'How have ye dared my sleep to break?  \nNo trifling cause should bid me wake.  \nSay, is all well? or tell the need  \nThat drives you with unruly speed  \nTo wake me. Mark the words I say,  \nThe king shall tremble in dismay,  \n\np. 474  \n\nThe fire be quenched and Indra slain  \nEre ye shall break my rest in vain.'  \n   Yupaksha answered: 'Chieftain, hear;  \nNo God or fiend excites our fear.  \nBut men in arms our walls assail:  \nWe tremble lest their might prevail.  \nFor vengeful Rama vows to slay  \nThe foe who stole his queen away,  \nAnd, matchless for his warlike deeds,  \nA host of mighty Vanars leads.  \nEre now a monstrous Vanar came.  \nLaid Lanka waste with ruthless flame,  \nAnd Aksha, Ravan's offspring, blew  \nWith all his warrior retinue.  \nOur king who never trembled yet  \nFor heavenly hosts in battle met.  \nAt length the general dread has shared,  \nO'erthrown by Rama's arm and spared.'  \n   He ceased: and Kumbhakarna spake:  \n'I will go forth and vengeance take;  \nWill tread their hosts beneath my feet,  \nThen triumph-flushed our king will meet.  \nOur giant bands shall eat their fill  \nOf Vanars whom this arm shall kill.  \nThe princes' blood shall be my draught,  \nThe chieftains' shall by you be quaffed.'  \nHe spake, and, with an eager stride  \nThat shook the earth, to Ravan hied,  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[472:1](ry456.htm#fr_982) An ancient king of Ayodhya said by some to have been\nPrithu's father.\n\n[472:2](ry456.htm#fr_983) The daughter of King Kus'adhwaja.
