Manu IV, 247. \'Ugra denotes either a bad\ntwice-born man. or the offspring of a Vai _s_ ya and of a _S_ udra-woman.\nOther persons of a similar character must be understood to be included by the\nterm.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[66:4](sbe0221.htm#fr_402) Also this rule seems to belong to Harita, on\naccount of its close connection with the preceding two.\n\n[66:8](sbe0221.htm#fr_403) Haradatta quotes, in support of the last Sutras, a\npassage of the _Kh_ andogya Upanishad, I, 10, 1, and one from the . _Ri_ _g_\n-veda, IV, 18, 13, according to which it would be lawful to eat even impure\nfood, as a dog\'s entrails, under such circumstances. Other commentators\nexplain this and the preceding three Sutras differently. According to them the\ntranslation would run thus: \'If he himself does not find any livelihood (in\ntimes of distress, he may dwell even with low-caste people who give him\nsomething to eat, and) he may eat (food given by them) paying for it with\n(some small gift in) gold or with animals.\' This second explanation is perhaps\npreferable.\n\n[66:9](sbe0221.htm#fr_404) Manu IV, 219, and 223.\n\n[67:11](sbe0221.htm#fr_405) If a Brahma _n_ a who has been ordered to perform\na penance, performs a Vai _s_ vadeva or other rite without heeding the order\nof his spiritual teacher, then a student who has returned home ought not to\neat in his house, until the enjoined penance has been performed.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[67:12](sbe0221.htm#fr_406) \'The use of the part. perf. pass. "performed"\nindicates that he must not eat there, whilst the penance is being performed.\'\n--Haradatta.\n\n[67:14](sbe0221.htm#fr_407) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. 1, 166.\n\n[67:15](sbe0221.htm#fr_408) Manu IV, 223\n\n[67:16](sbe0221.htm#fr_409) Manu IV, 209.\n\n[67:17](sbe0221.htm#fr_410) Manu IV, 209; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 168.\n\n[67:18](sbe0221.htm#fr_411) Manu IV, 2 10, 215; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 162-164.\n\n[67:19](sbe0221.htm#fr_412) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 164.\n\n[68:21](sbe0221.htm#fr_413) Manu IV, 212; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 162.\n\n[68:22](sbe0221.htm#fr_414) Manu IV, 210; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 161.\n\n[68:23](sbe0221.htm#fr_415) \'That is to say, one who has begun, but not\nfinished a Soma-sacrifice.\'--Haradatta. Manu IV, 210, and Gopatha-brahma _n_ a\nIII, 19.\n\n[68:25](sbe0221.htm#fr_416) Aitareya-brahma _n_ a II, 1, 9.\n\n[68:27](sbe0221.htm#fr_417) Manu I V, 211; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 161.\n\n[68:28](sbe0221.htm#fr_418) The village or town messengers are always men of\nthe lowest castes, such as the Mahars of Maharash _th_ ra.\n\n[68:29](sbe0221.htm#fr_419) \'For example, he who offers human blood in a magic\nrite.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[68:30](sbe0221.htm#fr_420) Haradatta explains _k_ ari, translated by \'spy,\'\nto mean \'a p. 69 secret adherent of the _S_ akta sect\' (gu _dh_ a _k_ ari, _s_\nakta _h_ ). The existence of this sect in early times has not hitherto been\nproved.\n\n[69:31](sbe0221.htm#fr_421) Haradatta gives the _S_ akyas or Bauddhas as an\ninstance. But it is doubtful, whether \xc3\x82pastamba meant to refer to them, though\nit seems probable that heretics are intended.\n\n[69:32](sbe0221.htm#fr_422) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 160.\n\n[69:33](sbe0221.htm#fr_423) \'Who avoids everybody, i.e. who neither invites\nnor dines with anybody.\'--Haradatta.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Pa _t_ ala 6, Kha _n_ _d_ a 19](sbe0222.htm)\n\n'
