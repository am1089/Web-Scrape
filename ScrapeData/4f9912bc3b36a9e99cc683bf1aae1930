'If some one were to strike at the root of this large tree here, it would\nbleed, but live. If he were to strike at its stem, it would bleed, but live.\nIf he were to strike at its top, it would bleed, but live.\n\np. 103\n\n[paragraph continues] Pervaded by the living Self that tree stands firm,\ndrinking in its nourishment and rejoicing;\n\n2\\. 'But if the life (the living Self) leaves one of its branches, that branch\nwithers; if it leaves a second, that branch withers; if it leaves a third,\nthat branch withers. If it leaves the whole tree, the whole tree withers 1. In\nexactly the same manner, my son, know this.' Thus he spoke:\n\n3\\. 'This (body) indeed withers and dies when the living Self has left it; the\nliving Self dies not.\n\n'That which is that subtile essence, in it all that exists has its self. It is\nthe True. It is the Self, and thou, _S_ vetaketu, art it.'\n\n'Please, Sir, inform me still more,' said the son.\n\n'Be it so, my child,' the father replied.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[102:2](sbe01129.htm#fr_291) The next question is: Waves, foam, and bubbles\narise from the water, and. when they merge again in the water, they are gone,\nHow is it that living beings, when in sleep or death they are merged again in\nthe Sat, are not destroyed?\n\n[103:1](sbe01129.htm#fr_292) The commentator remarks that according to the\nVeda, trees are conscious, while Buddhists and followers of Ka _n_ ada hold\nthem to be unconscious. They live, because one sees how their sap runs and how\nit dries up, just as one sees the sap in a living body, which, as we saw, was\nproduced by food and water. Therefore the simile holds good. The life, or,\nmore correctly, the liver, the living Self, pervades the tree, as it pervades\nman, when it has entered the organism which produces breath, mind, and speech.\nIf any accident happens to a branch, the living Self draws himself away from\nthat branch, and then the branch withers. The sap which caused the living Self\nto remain, goes, and the living Self goes away with it. The same applies to\nthe whole tree. The tree dies when the living Self leaves it, but the living\nSelf does not die; it only leaves an abode which it had before occupied. Some\nother illustrations, to show that the living Self remains, are added by the\ncommentator: First, with regard to the living Self being the same when it\nawakes from deep sleep (sushupti), he remarks that we remember quite well that\nwe have left something unfinished before we fell asleep. And then with regard\nto the living Self being the same when it awakes from death to a new life, he\nshows that creatures, as soon as they are born take the breast, and exhibit\nterror, which can only be explained, as he supposes, by their possessing a\nrecollection of a former state of existence.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 12](sbe01130.htm)\n\n"
