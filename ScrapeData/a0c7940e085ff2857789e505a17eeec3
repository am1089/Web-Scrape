There is a cake on eight potsherds for Agni: this he places on the\neastern part (of the Vedi). There is either a cake on eleven potsherds for\nIndra, or a rice-pap for Soma: this he places on the southern part. There is a\npap for the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_ (All-gods): this he places on the western part.\nThere is a dish of curds for Mitra-Varu _n_ a: this he places on the north\npart. There is a pap for B _ri_ haspati: this he places in the middle. This is\nthe five-holed pap 1;--what five sacrificial dishes (havis) there are, for\nthem there are five holes: hence the name 'five-holed pap.'\n\n5:5:1:22\\. And as to why the performer of the Ra _g_ asuya should perform this\noffering: because he (the priest) makes him ascend the regions, the seasons,\nthe hymns and metres, he now redeems him therefrom by this (offering). But\nwere the performer of the Ra _g_ asuya not to perform this offering, then\nverily he would become intoxicated (with pride) 2 and would fall down\nheadlong: that is why the performer of the Ra _g_ asuya performs this\noffering.\n\n5:5:1:33\\. And why he proceeds with the cake on eight\n\np. 121\n\npotsherds for Agni,--because he makes him ascend the eastern region, the\nseasons, the hymns and metres, he now redeems him therefrom by this\n(oblation). The remains of it he pours on the B _ri_ haspati pap.\n\n5:5:1:44\\. And why he proceeds with the cake on eleven potsherds for Indra, or\nwith the pap for Soma,--because he makes him ascend the southern region, the\nseasons, the hymns and metres, he now redeems him therefrom by this\n(oblation). The remains he pours on the B _ri_ haspati pap.\n\n5:5:1:55\\. And why he proceeds with the pap to the All-gods,--because he makes\nhim ascend the eastern region, the seasons, the hymns and metres, he now\nredeems him therefrom by this (oblation). The remains he pours on the B _ri_\nhaspati pap.\n\n5:5:1:66\\. And why he proceeds with the dish of curds for Mitra-Varu _n_ a,--\nbecause he makes him ascend the northern region, the seasons, the hymns and\nmetres, he now redeems him therefrom by this (oblation). The remains he pours\non the B _ri_ haspati pap. And in that he pours those remains on the B _ri_\nhaspati pap, he thereby bestows food upon him 1 (the Sacrificer); and hence\nfood is brought to the king from every quarter.\n\n5:5:1:77\\. And why he proceeds with the B _ri_ haspati pap,--because he makes\nhim ascend the upper region, the seasons, the hymns and metres, he now redeems\nhim therefrom by this (oblation).\n\n5:5:1:88\\. And what cake on eight potsherds there is for Agni, the priest's\nfee for that is gold; for that offering is for Agni, and gold is Agni's seed:\ntherefore\n\np. 122\n\nthe fee is gold. He gives it to the Agnidh; for he, the \xc3\x82gnidhra, is really\nthe same as Agni: therefore he gives it to the Agnidh.\n\n5:5:1:99\\. And what cake on eleven potsherds there is for Indra, the fee for\nthat is a bull, for the bull is Indra. And if there be a pap for Soma, then\nthe fee for that is a brown ox, for the brown one is sacred to Soma. He gives\nit to the Brahman, for the Brahman guards the sacrifice from the south:\ntherefore he gives it to the Brahman.\n\n5:5:1:1010\\. And what pap there is for the All-gods, the fee for that is a\npiebald bullock; for abundance of forms (marks) there is in such a piebald\nbullock, and the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_ are the clans, and the clans mean\nabundance: therefore a piebald bullock is the fee. He gives it to the Hot _ri_\n, for the Hot _ri_ means abundance: therefore he gives it to the Hot _ri_.\n\n5:5:1:1111\\. And what dish of curds there is for Mitra-Varu _n_ a, the fee for\nthat is a sterile cow, for that one is sacred to Mitra-Varu _n_ a. If he\ncannot procure a sterile cow, any unimpregnated one will do; for every sterile\ncow is indeed unimpregnated. He gives it to the two Adhvaryus; for the\nAdhvaryus are the out-breathing and the in-breathing, and the out-breathing\nand in-breathing are Mitra-Varu _n_ a: therefore he gives it to the two\nAdhvaryus.\n\n5:5:1:1212\\. And what pap there is for B _ri_ haspati, the fee for that is a\nwhite-backed bullock; for to B _ri_ haspati belongs that upper region 1, and\nabove that there is that path of Aryaman 2: therefore a white-backed (bullock)\nis the fee for the B _ri_ haspati (pap). He gives it to the Brahman, for B\n_ri_ haspati is the\n\np. 123\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahman of the gods, and this one is his (the\nSacrificer's) Brahman: therefore he gives it to the Brahman. Even a vish _th_\navra _g_ in 1 who is desirous of food may perform this offering: he (the\npriest) thereby bestows food upon him from all quarters, and verily he becomes\nan eater of food.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[120:1](sbe4123.htm#fr_236) According to Saya _n_ a (MS. I. O. 657) the term\n'Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ abila' is derived from the circumstance that the vessel (patri) on\nwhich the five sacrificial dishes are placed when taken about to be\n'deposited' on the vedi, contains five holes or openings for the dishes to be\ntaken out. The Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ abila oblations are to be performed during the light\nfortnight succeeding the performance of the Da _s_ apeya,--that is to say,\nduring the fortnight commencing with the new moon of Vai _s_ akha, or in the\nlatter part of April. The Taittiriya ceremonial calls these oblations the 'Di\n_s_ am avesh _t_ aya _h_ ,' i.e. 'Sacrifices performed for the appeasement of\nthe regions.'\n\n[120:2](sbe4123.htm#fr_237) Or, would become giddy (in flying through space),\ncf. Taitt. Br. I, 8, 3, 1.\n\n[121:1](sbe4123.htm#fr_238) Or, puts food into him.\n\n[122:1](sbe4123.htm#fr_239) Or rather, that upward direction.\n\n[122:2](sbe4123.htm#fr_240) That is, the region of light, of the sun. See [V,\n3, 1, 2](sbe4113.htm#5:3:1:2) with note.\n\n[123:1](sbe4123.htm#fr_241) The meaning of this compound is unknown. Saya _n_\na explains it as meaning 'one who does not move from one spot, one who always\nremains in one and the same place.' Hence the St. Petersburg dictionary\nconjectures: 'One whose herd (or cattle-pen, vra _g_ a, vra _g_ a) is\nstationary.' Similarly, Prof. Weber, in Bohtlingk's Dictionary. See, however,\nthe Ka _n_ va reading above, [p. 50](sbe4111.htm#page_50), note\n[1](sbe4111.htm#fn_115), according to which the word would seem to mean one\nafflicted with a certain malady (? cholera or dysentery). The 'Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_\nabila' offering may be performed as a special ish _t_ i, independently of the\nRa _g_ asuya.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 5, 2. Second Brahma _n_ a](sbe4124.htm)\n\n"
