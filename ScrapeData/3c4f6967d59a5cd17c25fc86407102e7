When the sage has poured out the threefold [1](sbe3250.htm#an_8:7:1:1)\ndraught to you, O Maruts, then you shine forth in the mountains (clouds).\n\n2\\. Aye, when, O bright Maruts, growing in strength, you have seen your way,\nthen the mountains (clouds) have gone down [1](sbe3250.htm#an_8:7:2:1).\n\n3\\. The sons of P _ri_ _s_ ni, the bulls, have risen together with the winds,\nthey have drawn forth the swelling draught.\n\n4\\. The Maruts sow the mist, they shake the mountains (clouds), when they go\ntheir way with the winds,\n\n5\\. When the mountain bent down before your march, the rivers before your\nrule, before your great power (blast).\n\n6\\. We invoke you by night for our protection, you by day, you while the\nsacrifice proceeds.\n\n7\\. And they rise up on their courses, the beautiful, of reddish hue\n[1](sbe3250.htm#an_8:7:7:1), the bulls, above the ridge of the sky.\n\n8\\. With might they send forth a ray of light, that the sun may have a path to\nwalk [1](sbe3250.htm#an_8:7:8:1): they have spread far and wide with their\nlights.\n\n9\\. Accept, O Maruts, this my speech, this hymn of praise, O _Ri_ bhukshans\n[1](sbe3250.htm#an_8:7:9:1), this my call.\n\n10\\. The P _ri_ _s_ nis [1](sbe3250.htm#an_8:7:10:1) (the clouds) yielded\nthree lakes (from their udders) as mead for the wielder of the thunderbolt\n(Indra), the well, the water-skin, the watering-pot\n[2](sbe3250.htm#an_8:7:10:2).\n\np. 391\n\n11\\. O Maruts, whenever we call you from heaven, wishing for your favour, come\nhither towards us.\n\n12\\. For you are bounteous [1](sbe3250.htm#an_8:7:12:1), in our house, O\nRudras, _Ri_ bhukshans: you are attentive, when you enjoy (the libations).\n\n13\\. O Maruts, bring to us from heaven enrapturing wealth, which nourishes\nmany, which satisfies all.\n\n14\\. When you have seen your way, brilliant Maruts, as it were from above\n[1](sbe3250.htm#an_8:7:14:1) the mountains, you rejoice in the (Soma) drops\nwhich have been pressed out.\n\n15\\. Let the mortal with his prayers ask the favour of that immense,\nunconquerable (host) [1](sbe3250.htm#an_8:7:15:1) of them,\n\n16\\. Who like torrents [1](sbe3250.htm#an_8:7:16:1) foam along heaven and\nearth with their streams of rain, drawing the inexhaustible well.\n\n17\\. These sons of P _ri_ _s_ ni rise up together with rattlings, with\nchariots, with the winds, and with songs of praise.\n\n18\\. That (help) with which you helped Turva _s_ a, Yadu, and Ka _n_ va when\nhe carried off riches, that we pray for, greatly for our wealth.\n\n19\\. O bounteous Maruts, may these draughts, swelling like butter, strengthen\nyou, together with the prayers of Ka _n_ va.\n\n20\\. Where do you rejoice now, O bounteous Maruts, when an altar has been\nprepared for you? What priest serves you?\n\n21\\. For you for whom we have prepared an altar, do not, as it was with you\nformerly, in return for these praises, gladden the companies of our sacrifice.\n\n22\\. These Maruts have brought together piece\n\np. 392\n\nby piece [1](sbe3250.htm#an_8:7:22:1) the great waters, heaven and earth, the\nsun, and the thunderbolt;\n\n23\\. And, while performing their manly work, they have trodden V _ri_ tra to\npieces, and the dark mountains (clouds).\n\n24\\. They protected the strength and intelligence of the fighting Trita, they\nprotected Indra in his struggle with V _ri_ tra.\n\n25\\. Holding lightnings in their hands, they hasten heavenward, golden helmets\n[1](sbe3250.htm#an_8:7:25:1) are on their head; the brilliant Maruts have\nadorned themselves for beauty.\n\n26\\. When with U _s_ ana [2](sbe3250.htm#an_8:7:26:2) you have come from afar\nto Uksh _n_ orandhra (ox-hollow) [1](sbe3250.htm#an_8:7:26:1), he roared from\nfear, like Dyu (the sky).\n\n27\\. O gods, come to us with your golden-hoofed horses, for the offering of\nthe sacrifice [1](sbe3250.htm#an_8:7:27:1).\n\n28\\. When the red leader leads their spotted deer in their chariot, the\nbrilliant Maruts approach and let the waters run.\n\n29\\. The heroes went downwards to _S_ arya _n_ avat, to Sushoma, to \xc3\x82r _g_\nika, to Pastyavat.\n\n30\\. When will you come hither, O Maruts, to the sage who calls you so, with\nyour consolations to the suppliant?\n\n31\\. What then now? Where are your friends, now that you have forsaken Indra?\nWho is counted in your friendship?\n\n32\\. O Ka _n_ vas, I praise Agni, together with our Maruts, who carry the\nthunderbolt in their hands, and are armed with golden daggers.\n\n33\\. Might I succeed in bringing hither the strong hunters, hither with their\nsplendid booty for the newest blessings.\n\np. 393\n\n34\\. The hills even sink low, as if they thought themselves valleys, the\nmountains even bow themselves down.\n\n35\\. The crossing (horses) bring them hither, flying through the air; they\nbestow strength on the man who praises them.\n\n36\\. The old fire [1](sbe3250.htm#an_8:7:36:1) has been born, like the shine\n[2](sbe3250.htm#an_8:7:36:2) by the splendour of the sun, and the Maruts have\nspread far and wide with their lights.\n\np. 394\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nAscribed to Punarvatsa Ka _n_ va. Verse 8 occurs MS. IV, 12, 5; verse 11 in\nTS. I, 5, 11, 4; MS. IV, 10, 4; verse 28 in AV. XIII, 1, 21. Metre, Gayatri.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Trish _t_ ubham is an adjective belonging to isham. The same\nexpression occurs again, VIII, 69, 1, as a galita, and is therefore of little\nhelp. In IX, 62, 24, the isha _h_ are called parish _t_ ubha _h_ , which seems\nto mean something like parisrut, i. e. standing round about. I therefore take\ntrish _t_ ubh in our passage simply as threefold, referring probably to the\nmorning, noon, and evening sacrifice. The sacrifice is often called triv _ri_\nt, X, 52, 4; 124, 1. Some scholars ascribe to stubh in trish _t_ ubh the\nmeaning of liturgical shouting.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Besides ni ahasata, we find ud ahasata, I, 9, 4, and apa ahasata, IX,\n73, 6. On _k_ i, see verse 14, and V, 55, 7. It is often impossible to say\nwhether the Vedic Aorist should be translated in English by the perfect or the\nimperfect. If we take the verse as describing an historical fact, it would be,\n'When you saw your way, or, as soon as you had seen your way, the clouds\nfell.' If it is meant as a repeated event, it would be, 'when, i. e. whenever\nyou have seen your way, the clouds have fallen.' The difficulty lies in\nEnglish, and though the grammars lay down rules, usage does not conform to\nthem. The difference in the use of tenses in English is so great that in the\nrevised version of the Bible, a number of passages had to be translated\ndifferently for the English and for the American public. Thus in Rom. ii. 12,\nthe English edition gives, 'For as many as have sinned without law, shall\nperish without law.' The American edition changes this into 'As many as sinned\nwithout the law.' Gal. iii. 22, English: 'The scripture hath shut up;'\nAmerican: 'The scripture shut up.' It was on account of this and other changes\nof\n\np. 395\n\nidiom which have sprung up between English and American, that different\neditions of the revised version had actually to be printed for England and\nAmerica. No wonder, therefore, that an American critic should in his innocence\nhave charged me with not knowing the difference between the aorist, the\nimperfect, and the perfect in Vedic Sanskrit!\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. Aru _n_ apsu, perhaps reddish-coloured, an epithet of the dawn. here\napplied to the Maruts. The Maruts are sometimes called v _ri_ shapsu,\nahrutapsu, I, 52, 4; VIII, 20, 7.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. The relation between the light cast forth by the Maruts and the path\nof the sun is not quite clear, except that in other places also the Maruts are\nconnected with the morning. The darkness preceding a thunderstorm may be\nidentified with the darkness of the night, preceding the sunrise. See\nBergaigne, II, 379 seq.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. The meaning of _ri_ bhukshan is doubtful. It is applied to Indra and\nthe Maruts. See Bergaigne, II, 403; 404 note; 412.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. The P _ri_ _s_ nis in the plural fem. are the clouds, see VIII, 6, 19.\nMythologically there is but one P _ri_ _s_ ni, the mother of the Maruts. See\nalso Bergaigne, II, 397.\n\nNote 2. I am doubtful about the three lakes of Madhu, here of rain, poured\nfrom their udders by the clouds. The number three is common enough, and Ludwig\nhas pointed out a parallel passage from the AV. X, 10, 10-12, where we read of\nthree patras, filled with milk and Soma. Many similar passages have been\ncollected by Bergaigne, I, 177, but again without a definite result. The\nquestion is whether the three words utsa, kavandha, and udrin are meant as\nnames of the three patras, in our passage, of the three lakes, or whether they\nshould be taken as an apposition,\n\np. 396\n\nthe three lakes, namely, the well (of the sky), the skin full of water, and\nudrin, the watering-pot. Udrin is elsewhere an adjective only, but I think we\nmust here translate, 'the well, the water-skin, the watering-pot.'\n\n##### Verse 12.\n\nNote 1. On sudanava _h_ as vocative, see Delbruck, Syntax, p. 106.\n\n##### Verse 14.\n\nNote 1. For adhi with genitive, one expects ati. But Delbruck doubts whether\nati can govern the genitive. See Altind. Syntax, p. 440.\n\n##### Verse 15.\n\nNote 1. As adabhyasya can only refer to eta\xc2\xb4vata _h_ , I have taken etavat in\nthe sense of ga _n_ a, followed by esham. But I am not certain that the\nrendering is right.\n\n##### Verse 16.\n\nNote 1. I have ventured to translate drapsa _h_ by torrents. Neither drops nor\nsparks nor banners seem to yield an appropriate simile, but I feel very\ndoubtful. See VIII, 96, 13; IX, 73, 1.\n\n##### Verse 22.\n\nNote 1. I thought at first that by sam parva _s_ a _h_ dadhu _h_ was meant the\nmixing or confounding together of heaven and earth; it being impossible,\nduring a storm, to distinguish the two. But there is clearly, as Ludwig points\nout, an opposition between sam dadhu _h_ and vi yayu _h_. I therefore take\nparva _s_ a _h_ in verse 22 in the sense of piece by piece, as in AV. IV, 12,\n7. sam dadhat parusha paru _h_ , while in verse 23 it means in pieces.\n\n##### Verse 25.\n\nNote 1. On _s_ ipra _h_ , see note to II, 34, 3.\n\n##### Verse 26.\n\nNote 1. Uksh _n_ a _h_ randhram, 'the hollow of the bull,' whatever that may\nbe, is not mentioned again. If it is meant for\n\np. 397\n\nthe dark cloud which hides the rain, then the roar of the bull would be the\nthunder of the cloud, stirred by the Maruts. Auksh _n_ orandhra, however, is\nthe technical name of certain Samans, so that Uksh _n_ orandhra may have been,\nlike U _s_ ana (later U _s_ anas), a proper name. See Ta _n_ _d_ ya Br. XIII,\n9, 18; 19.\n\nNote 2. If u _s_ ana stands for u _s_ anaya it might mean, 'with desire,' but\nit seems more likely that it refers to the _Ri_ shi, who is called U _s_ ana\nin the Rig-veda, and U _s_ anas in later writings. See Lanman, p. 562, l. 21;\nBergaigne, II, 338, n. 3; Schmidt, K. Z. XXVI, 402, n. 1.\n\n##### Verse 27.\n\nNote 1. On makhasya davane, see note to I, 6, 8, where I accepted the old\nexplanation, 'Come to the offering of the priest.' But does makha mean priest?\nIn later Sanskrit it means sacrifice, so that makhasya davane has been\ntranslated, 'for the offering of the sacrifice,' that is, 'that we may be able\nto offer you sacrifice.' If makha means glad and refers to Soma, which is\ndoubtful, the sense would be the same. Possibly davane may here be derived\nfrom do, to divide, but this would not help us much.\n\n##### Verse 28.\n\nThe AV. reads yam tva p _r i_shati rathe prash _t_ ir vahati rohita, _s_ ubha\xc2\xb4\nyasi ri _n_ ann apa _h_ , which yields no help.\n\n##### Verse 29.\n\nThis verse is very difficult. First of all, ni _k_ akraya can hardly mean\n'without a chariot' (B.-R.), but seems an adverb, meaning downwards. But the\nchief difficulty lies in this, that we must decide, once for all, whether\nwords, such as sushoma, _s_ arya _n_ avat, ar _g_ ika, pastyavat, &c., are to\nbe interpreted in their natural sense, as expressing localities, well known to\nthe poet, or in their technical sense, as names of sacrificial vessels. That\nthis decision is by no means easy, may be inferred from the fact that two\nscholars, Roth and Ludwig, differ completely, the former preferring the\ntechnical, the latter the geographical meaning. We must\n\np. 398\n\nremember that in the hymns to the Maruts the poets speak occasionally of the\ncountries, far and near, visited by the storm-winds. We must also bear in mind\nthat in our very passage the poet asks the Maruts to come to him, and not to\ntarry with other people. When, therefore, he says, that they went to _S_ arya\n_n_ avat, &c., is that likely to be meant for a tank of Soma at his own or any\nother sacrifice?\n\n_S_ arya _n_ avat is derived from _s_ arya, this from _s_ ara. _S_ ara means\nreed, arrow; sarya, made of reeds, _s_ arya, an arrow, but also reeds tied\ntogether and used at the sacrifice for carrying Soma-oblations. From it, _s_\narya _n_ a, which, according to Saya _n_ a, means lands in Kurukshetra (RV.\nVIII, 6, 39), and from which _S_ arya _n_ avat is derived, as the name of a\nlake in that neighbourhood (not a Landstrich, B.-R.). When this _s_ arya _n_\navat occurs in the Rig-veda, the question is, does it mean that lake,\nevidently a famous lake and a holy place in the early settlements of the Vedic\n\xc3\x82ryas, or does it mean, as others suppose, a sacrificial vessel made of reeds?\nIt occurs in the Rig-veda seven times.\n\nIn I, 84, 14, Indra is said to have found the head of the horse, which had\nbeen removed among the mountains (clouds) at _S_ arya _n_ avat. This seems to\nme the lake in which the sun sets. In the 8th Ma _n_ _d_ ala sarya _n_ avat\noccurs three times. In VIII, 6, 39, Indra is invoked to rejoice at _S_ arya\n_n_ avat, or, according to others, in a vessel full of Soma. In our passage\nthe Maruts went to _S_ arya _n_ avat, to Sushoma, \xc3\x82r _g_ ika, and Pastyavat,\ncountries, it would seem, not vessels. In VIII, 64, it, after saying that the\nSoma had been prepared among the Purus, it is added that the Soma is sweetest\nin _S_ arya _n_ avat, on the Sushoma, and in \xc3\x82r _g_ ikiya. In IX, 65, 22, we\nread of Somas prepared far and near, and at _S_ arya _n_ avat, and in the next\nverse we read of Somas to be found either among the \xc3\x82r _g_ ikas, among the\nPastyas, or among the Five Tribes. In IX, 113, 1; 2, Indra is asked to drink\nSoma at _S_ arya _n_ avat, and the Soma is asked to come from \xc3\x82r _g_ ika. In\nX, 35, 2, the aid is implored of heaven and earth, of the rivers and the\nmountains, and these mountains are called _s_ arya _n_ avata _h_.\n\np. 399\n\n[paragraph continues] \xc3\x82r _g_ ikiya, besides the three passages mentioned\nalready, occurs X, 75, 5, where it is clearly a river as well as Sushoma,\nwhile in IX, 65, 23, the \xc3\x82r _g_ ikas, in the plural, could only be the name of\na people.\n\nTaking all this into account, it seems to me that we ought to accept the\ntradition that _S_ arya _n_ avat was a lake and the adjoining district in\nKurukshetra, that \xc3\x82r _g_ ika was the name of a river, \xc3\x82r _g_ ika the name of\nthe adjoining country, \xc3\x82r _g_ ika _h_ , of the inhabitants, \xc3\x82r _g_ ikiya\nanother name of \xc3\x82r _g_ ika, the river, and \xc3\x82r _g_ ikiyam another name of the\ncountry \xc3\x82r _g_ ika. Sushoma in our passage is probably the name of the country\nnear the Sushoma, and Pastyavat, though it might be an adjective meaning\nfilled with hamlets, is probably another geographical name; see, however, IX,\n65, 23. Ludwig takes _S_ arya _n_ avat as a name of the Eastern Sarasvati; see\nZimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 19; but we should expect _S_ arya _n_ avati as\nthe name of a river. See also Bergaigne, I, 206, who, according to his system,\ntakes all these names as 'preparateurs celestes du Soma.'\n\n##### Verse 31.\n\nSee I, 38, 1, note 1.\n\n##### Verse 36.\n\nNote 1. Saya _n_ a may be right in stating that this verse was intended for an\n\xc3\x82gnimaruta sacrifice, and that therefore Agni was praised first, and\nafterwards the Maruts. In that case purvya might mean first.\n\nNote 2. _Kh_ andas is doubtful; see, however, I, 92, 6.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 20. To the Maruts (the Storm-gods)](sbe3251.htm)\n\n"
