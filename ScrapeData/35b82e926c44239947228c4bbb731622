Narada said :-- O Bhagavan! I have heard about the glories of Hari,\nabout the Tattvaj\xc3\xb1anam (the True Knowledge) and the story of Lak _s_ mi. Now\ntell me Her Dhyanam (meditation) and Stotram (recitation of hymns) of Her.\nNaraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! Indra then, bathed first in the Tirath (holy\nplace) and, wearing a cleansed cloth, installed, first of all, an earthen jar\n(gha _t_ a) on the beach of the K _s_ iroda Ocean. Then he worshipped with\ndevotion Ganes\xc2\x92a, Surya, Fire, Vi _sn_ u, S\xc2\x92iva, and S\xc2\x92iva, the six deities\nwith scents and flowers. Next Indra invoked Maha Lak _s_ mi, of the nature of\nthe highest powers and greatest prosperity, and began to worship Her as\nBrahma, who was acting as an officiating priest in the presence of the Munis,\nBrahma _n_ as, Brihaspati, Hari and the other Devas, had dictated him. He\nfirst smeared one Parijata flower with sandal paste and reciting the\nmeditation mantra of Maha Lak _s_ mi offered it to Her feet. The meditation\nmantra that was recited by Devendra, was what Bhagavan Hari first gave to\nBrahma. I am now telling you that. Listen.\n\n\n\n\xc2\x93O Mother! Thou residest on the thousand-petalled lotus. The beauty of Thy\nface excels the beauty of ko _t_ i autumnal Full Moons. Thou art shining with\nThy own splendour. Thou art very beautiful and lovely; Thy colour is like the\nburnished gold; Thou art with form, chaste, ornamented all over with jewel\nornaments; Thou art wearing the yellow cloth and look! What beauty is coming\nout of it! Always a sweet smile reigns on Thy lips. Thy beauty is constant;\nThou art the bestower of prosperity to all. O Maha Lak _s_ mi! I meditate on\nThee.\xc2\x94 Thus meditating on Her endowed with various attributes with this\nmantra, Indra worshipped devotedly with sixteen upacharas (articles offered).\nEvery upachara (article) was offered with the repetition of mantra. All the\nthings were very excellent, right and commendable. \xc2\x93O Maha Lak _s_ mi!\n\n\n\np. 970\n\n\n\nVis\xc2\x92vakarma has made this invaluable \xc3\x82san (a carpet seat) wonderfully decked\nwith jewels; I am offering this \xc3\x82san to Thee. Accept. O Thou residing in the\nLotus! This holy Ganges water is considered with great regard and desired by\nall. This is like the fire to burn the fuel in the shape of the sins of the\nsinners. O Thou! The Dweller in the Lotus! This Durbha grass, flowers, this\nArghya (offering) of the Ganges water perfumed with sandalpaste, I am offering\nto Thee. Accept. O Beloved of Hari! This sweet scented flower oil and this\nsweet scented \xc3\x82malaki fruit lead to the beauty of the body; therefore I\npresent this to Thee. Accept. O Devi!

O Beloved of Kri\n_sn_ a! I am presenting this sweet scented holy Dhupa prepared from various\nherbs and plants, exquisitely nice and the root of all beauty, to Thee.\nAccept. This sweet scented pleasant sandalpaste I offer to Thee, O Devi!\nAccept. O Ruler of the Devas! I present this pleasing holy Dipa (lights) which\nis the eye of this world and by which all the darkness is vanished; accept. O\nDevi! I present to Thee these very delicious offerings of fruits, etc., very\njuicy and of various kinds. Accept. O Deves'i! This Anna (food) is Brahma and\nthe chief means to preserve the life of living beings. By this the nourishment\nof the body and the mental satisfaction are effected. Therefore I am\npresenting this food to Thee. Accept. O Maha Lak _s_ mi! I am presenting this\nmost delicious Paramanna, which is prepared out of rice, milk and sugar, to\nThee. Accept. O Devi! I am presenting this most delicious and pleasant\nsvastika prepared of sugar and clarified butter to Thee; accept. O Beloved of\nAchyuta! I am presenting to Thee various beautiful Pakkannas, ripe delicious\nfruits and clarified butter out of cow\xc2\x92s milk; accept. O Devi! The sugarcane\njuice, when heated, yields a syrup which again heated yields very delicious\nand nice thing called Gur. I am presenting this Gur to Thee; accept. O Devi! I\nam presenting to Thee the sweetmeats prepared out of the flour of Yava and and\nwheat and Gur and clarified butter; accept. I am presenting with devotion the\noffering made of Svastika and the flour of other grains; accept. O Kamale! I\nam presenting to Thee this fan and white chamara, which blows cool air and is\nvery pleasant when this body gets hot; accept. O Devi! I am presenting this\nbetel scented with camphor by which the inertness of the tongue is removed;\naccept. O Devi!

I am presenting to Thee these pure garlands of flowers which\nblossom in different seasons, which look very beautiful and which give\nsatisfaction to the Devas and to the kings. Accept. O Devi! I am presenting to\nThee this nice scent, this very holy thing to Thee by which both the body and\nmind become pure, which is most auspicious and which is prepared of many\nfragrant herbs and plants; accept.

I am presenting to Thee all those\nthings that are extraordinary, very rare in this earth and fit to be enjoyed\nby the Devas and worthy of their ornaments; accept.\xc2\x94 O Devar _s_ i! Uttering\nthose mantras, the Devendra offered those articles, with intense devotion\naccording to the rules. He, then, made Japam of the Mula Mantra (the Radical\nSeed Mantra) ten lakhs of times. Thus his Mantra revealed the Deity thereof\nand thus came to a successful issue. The lotus born Brahma gave this Mantra\n\xc2\x93S\xc2\x92rim Hrim Klim Aim Kamalavasinyai Svaha\xc2\x94 to the Devendra. This is like a\nKalpavrik _s_ a (the tree in Indra\xc2\x92s garden yielding whatever may be desired).\nThis Vaidik mantra is the chief of the mantras. The word \xc2\x93Svaha\xc2\x94 is at the end\nof the mantra. By virtue of this Mantra, Kuvera got his highest prosperity. By\nthe power of this Mantra, the King-Emperor Dak _s_ a Savar _n_ i Manu and\nMangala became the lords of the earth with seven islands. Priyavrata,\nUttanapada, and Kedararaja all these became Siddhas (were fructified with\nsuccess) and became King-Emperors. O Narada! When Indra attained success in\nthis Mantra, there appeared before him Maha Lak _s_ mi, seated in the\ncelestial car, decked with excellent gems and jewels. The Great Halo, coming\nout of Her body made manifest the earth with seven islands. Her colour was\nwhite like the white champaka flower and Her whole body was decked with\nornaments. Her face was always gracious and cheerful with sweet smiles. She\nwas ever ready to shew Her kindness to the Bhaktas. On Her neck there was a\ngarland of jewels and gems, bright as ten million Moons. O Devar _s_ i! No\nsooner did Indra see that World Mother Maha Lak _s_ mi, of a peaceful\nappearance, than his body was filled with joy and the hairs of the body stood\non ends. His eyes were filled with tears; and, with folded palms, he began to\nrecite stotras to Her, the Vaidik stotras, yielding all desires, that was\ncommunicated to him by Brahma.\n\n\n\n51-75. Indra said :-- \xc2\x93O Thou, the Dweller in the lotus! O Naraya _n_ i! O\nDear to Kri _sn_ a! O Padmasane! O Maha Lak _s_ mi!\n\n\n\np. 972\n\n\n\nObeisance to Thee! O Padmadalek _s_ a _n_ e! O Padmanibhanane! O Padmasane! O\nPadme! O Vai _sn_ avi! Obeisance to Thee! Thou art the wealth of all; Thou art\nworshipped by all; Thou bestowest to all the bliss and devotion to S\xc2\x92ri Hari.\nI bow down to Thee. O Devi! Thou always dwellest on the breast of Kri _sn_ a\nand exercisest Thy powers over Him. Thou art the beauty of the Moon; Thou\ntakest Thy seat on the beautiful Jewel Lotus. Obeisance to Thee! O Devi! Thou\nart the Presiding Deity of the riches; Thou art the Great Devi; Thou\nincreasest always Thy gifts and Thou art the bestower of increments. So I bow\ndown to Thee. O Devi! Thou art the Maha Lak _s_ mi of Vaiku _nt_ ha, the Lak\n_s_ mi of the K _s_ iroda Ocean; Thou art Indra\xc2\x92s Heavenly Lak _s_ mi; Thou\nart the Raja Lak _s_ mi of the Kings; Thou art the Griha Lak _s_ mi of the\nhouseholders; Thou art the household Deity of them; Thou art the Surabhi, born\nof the Ocean; Thou art the Dak _s_ i _n_ a, the wife of the Sacrifices; Thou\nart Aditi, the Mother of the Devas; Thou art the Kamala, always dwelling in\nthe Lotus; Thou art the Svaha, in the offerings with clarified butter in the\nsacrificial ceremonies; Thou art the Svadha Mantra in the Kavyas (an offering\nof food to deceased ancestors). So obeisance to Thee! O Mother Thou art of the\nnature of Vi _sn_ u; Thou art the Earth that supports all; Thou art of pure\nS\xc2\x92uddha Sattva and Thou art devoted to Naraya _n_ a. Thou art void of anger,\njealousy. Rather Thou grantest boons to all. Thou art the auspicious Sarada;\nThou grantest the Highest Reality and the devotional service to Hari. Without\nThee all the worlds are quite stale, to no purpose like ashes, always dead\nwhile existing. Thou art the Chief Mother, the Chief Friend of all; Thou art\nthe source of Dharma, Artha, Kama and Mok _s_ a! As a mother nourishes her\ninfants with the milk of her breasts, so Thou nourishest all as their mother!\nA child that sucks the milk might be saved by the Daiva (Fate), when deprived\nof its mother; but men can never be saved, if they be bereft of Thee! O\nMother! Thou art always gracious. Please be gracious unto me. O Eternal One!\nMy possessions are now in the hands of the enemies. Be kind enough to restore\nmy kingdoms to me from my enemies\xc2\x92 hands. O Beloved of Hari! Since Thou hast\nforsaken me, I am wandering abroad, friendless, like a beggar, deprived of all\nprosperities. O Devi! Give me J\xc3\xb1anam, Dharma, my desired fortune, power,\ninfluence and my possessions.\xc2\x94 O Narada! Indra and all the other Devas bowed\ndown frequently to Maha Lak _s_ mi with their eyes filled with tears. Brahma,\nS\xc2\x92ankara, Ananta Deva, Dharma and Kes\xc2\x92ava all asked pardon again and again\nfrom Maha Lak _s_ mi. Lak _s_ mi then granted boons to the Devas and before\n\n\n\np. 973\n\n\n\nthe assembly gladly gave the garland of flowers on the neck of Ke\xc2\x92sava. The\nDevas, satisfied, went back to their own places. The Devi, Lak _s_ mi, too,\nbecoming very glad went to S\xc2\x92ri Hari sleeping in the K _s_ iroda Ocean. Brahma\nand Mahes\xc2\x92vara, both became very glad and, blessing the Devas, went\nrespectively to their own abodes. Whoever recites this holy Stotra three times\na day, becomes the King Emperor and gets prosperity and wealth like the God\nKuvera. Siddhi (success) comes to him who recites this stotra five lakhs of\ntimes. If anybody reads regularly and always this Siddha Stotra for one month,\nhe becomes very happy and he turns out a Rajarajendra.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Forty-second Chapter of the Ninth Book on the Dhyanam and Stotra\nof Maha Lak _s_ mi in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000\nverses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 43](bk09ch43.htm)\n\n"
