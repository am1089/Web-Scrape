I.\n\nDescendants of Priyavrata, the eldest son of Swayambhuva Manu: his ten sons:\nthree adopt a religious life; the others become kings of the seven Dwipas, or\nisles, of the earth. Agnidhra, king of Jambu-dwipa, divides it into nine\nportions, which he distributes amongst his sons. Nabhi, king of the south,\nsucceeded by Rishabha; and he by Bharata: India named after him Bharata: his\ndescendants reign during the Swayambhuva Manwantara.\n\nMAITREYA.--You have related to me, venerable preceptor, most fully, all that I\nwas curious to hear respecting the creation of the world; but there is a part\nof the subject which I am desirous again to have described. You stated that\nPriyavrata and Uttanapada were the sons of Swayambhuva Manu, and you repeated\nthe story of Dhruva, the son of Uttanapada: you made no mention of the\ndescendants of Priyavrata, and it is an account of his family that I beg you\nwill kindly communicate to me.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--Priyavrata married Kamya, the daughter of the patriarch Kardama 1,\nand had by her two daughters, Samrat and Kukshi, and ten\n\np. 162\n\nsons, wise, valiant, modest, and dutiful, named Agnidhra, Agnibahu, Vapushmat,\nDyutimat, Medha, Medhatithi, Bhavya, Savala, Putra, and the tenth was\nJyotishmat 2, illustrious by nature as by name. These were the sons of\nPriyavrata, famous for strength and prowess. Of these, three, or Medha, Putra,\nand Agnibahu, adopted a religious life: remembering the occurrences of a prior\nexistence, they did not covet dominion, but diligently practised the rites of\ndevotion in due season, wholly disinterested, and looking for no reward.\n\nPriyavrata having divided the earth into seven continents, gave them\nrespectively to his other seven sons 3. To Agnidhra he gave Jambu-dwipa; to\nMedhatithi he gave Plaksha-dwipa: he installed Vapushmat in the sovereignty\nover the Dwipa of Salmali; and made Jyotishmat king of Ku\xc5\x9ba-dwipa: he\nappointed Dyutimat to rule over Krauncha-dwipa; Bhavya to reign over Saka-\ndwipa; and Savala he nominated the monarch of the Dwipa of Pushkara.\n\nAgnidhra, the king of Jambu-dwipa, had nine sons, equal in splendour to the\npatriarchs: they were named Nabhi, Kimpurusha, Harivarsha, Ilavrita, Ramya,\nHiran\xcc\x81vat, Kuru, Bhadra\xc5\x9bwa, and Ketumala 4, who was a prince ever active in\nthe practice of piety.\n\nHear next, Maitreya, in what manner Agnidhra apportioned Jambu-dwipa amongst\nhis nine sons. He gave to Nabhi the country called Hima, south of the Himavat,\nor snowy mountains. The country of Hemakut\xcc\x81a he gave to Kimpurusha; and to\nHarivarsha, the country of\n\np. 163\n\n[paragraph continues] Nishadha. The region in the centre of which mount Meru\nis situated he conferred on Ilavrita; and to Ramya, the countries lying\nbetween it and the Nila mountain. To Hiran\xcc\x81vat his father gave the country\nlying to the north of it, called \xc5\x9aweta; and, on the north of the \xc5\x9aweta\nmountains, the country bounded by the \xc5\x9aringavan range he gave to Kuru. The\ncountries on the east of Meru he assigned to Bhadra\xc5\x9bwa; and Gandhamadana,\nwhich lay west of it, he gave to Ketumala 5.\' Having installed his sons\nsovereigns in these several regions, the pious king Agnidhra retired to a life\nof penance at the holy place of pilgrimage, \xc5\x9aalagrama 6.\n\nThe eight Varshas, or countries, Kimpurusha and the rest, are places of\nperfect enjoyment, where happiness is spontaneous and uninterrupted. In them\nthere is no vicissitude, nor the dread of decrepitude or death: there is no\ndistinction of virtue or vice, nor difference of degree as better or worse,\nnor any of the effects produced in this region by the revolutions of ages.\n\nNabhi, who had for his portion the country of Himahwa, had by his queen Meru\nthe magnanimous Rishabha; and he had a hundred sons, the eldest of whom was\nBharata. Rishabha having ruled with equity and wisdom, and celebrated many\nsacrificial rites, resigned the sovereignty of the earth to the heroic\nBharata, and, retiring to the hermitage of Pulastya, adopted the life of an\nanchoret, practising religious penance, and performing all prescribed\nceremonies, until, emaciated by his austerities, so as to be but a collection\nof skin and fibres, he put a pebble in his mouth, and naked went the way of\nall flesh 7. The country was\n\np. 164\n\ntermed Bharata from the time that it was relinquished to Bharata by his\nfather, on his retiring to the woods 8.\n\nBharata, having religiously discharged the duties of his station, consigned\nthe kingdom to his son Sumati, a most virtuous prince; and, engaging in devout\npractices, abandoned his life at the holy place, \xc5\x9aalagrama: he was afterwards\nborn again as a Brahman, in a distinguished family of ascetics. I shall\nhereafter relate to you his history.\n\nFrom the illustrious Sumati was born Indradyumna: his son was Paramesht\xcc\x81hin:\nhis son was Pratihara, who had a celebrated son, named\n\np. 165\n\n[paragraph continues] Pratihartta: his son was Bhava, who begot Udgitha, who\nbegot Prastara; whose son was Prithu. The son of Prithu was Nakta: his son was\nGaya: his son was Nara; whose son was Virat. The valiant son of Virat was\nDhimat, who begot Mahanta; whose son was Manasyu; whose son was Twasht\xcc\x81ri: his\nson was Viraja: his son was Raja: his son was \xc5\x9aatajit, who had a hundred sons,\nof whom Viswagjyotish was the eldest 9. Under these princes, Bharata-varsha\n(India) was divided into nine portions (to be hereafter particularized); and\ntheir descendants successively held possession of the country for seventy-one\nperiods of the aggregate of the four ages (or for the reign of a Manu).\n\nThis was the creation of Swayambhuva Manu, by which the earth was peopled,\nwhen he presided over the first Manwantara, in the Kalpa of Varaha 10\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[161:1](vp058.htm#fr_364) The text reads Kanya; and the commentator has, \'he\nmarried the daughter of Kardama, whose name was Kanya.\' The copies agree in\nthe reading, and the Vayu has the same name, Kanya; but the Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya,\nwhich is the same in other respects as our text, has Kamya: Kamya also is the\nname elsewhere given by the Vayu to the daughter of Kardama ([p.\n83](vp045.htm#page_83). n. [6](vp045.htm#fn_245)). Kamya, as has been noticed,\nappears in the Brahma and Hari V. ([p. 53](vp041.htm#page_53). n.\n[6](vp041.htm#fn_204)) as the mother of Priyavrata, but erroneously; and the\nsame authorities specify a Kamya as the wife of that sovereign. So the\ncommentator on the Hari V. states, \'another Kamya is mentioned (in the text),\nthe daughter of Kardama, the wife of Priyavrata.\' p. 162 The name Kanya is\ntherefore most probably an error of the copyists. The Bhagavata calls the wife\nof Priyavrata, Varhishmati, the daughter of Vi\xc5\x9bwakarman.\n\n[162:2](vp058.htm#fr_365) These names nearly agree in the authorities which\nspecify the descendants of Priyavrata, except in the Bhagavata: that has an\nalmost entirely different series of names, or \xc3\x81gnidhra, Idhmajihwa, Yajnabahu,\nMahavira, Hiran\xcc\x81yaretas, Medhatithi, Ghritaprisht\xcc\x81ha, Savana, Vitihotra, and\nKavi; with one daughter, Urjjaswati. It also calls the Manus Uttama, Tamasa,\nand Raivata the sons of Priyavrata by another wife.\n\n[162:3](vp058.htm#fr_366) According to the Bhagavata, he drove his chariot\nseven times round the earth, and the ruts left by the wheels became the beds\nof the oceans, separating it into seven Dwipas.\n\n[162:4](vp058.htm#fr_367) Even the Bhagavata concurs with the other Puran\xcc\x81as\nin this series of Priyavrata\'s grandsons.\n\n[163:5](vp058.htm#fr_368) Of these divisions, as well as of those of the\nearth, and of the minor divisions of the Varshas, we have further particulars\nin the following chapter.\n\n[163:6](vp058.htm#fr_369) This place of pilgrimage has not been found\nelsewhere. The term is usually applied to a stone, an ammonite, which is\nsupposed to be a type of Vishn\xcc\x81u, and of which the worship is enjoined in the\nUttara Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a of the Padma P. and in the Brahma Vaivartta, authorities of no\ngreat weight or antiquity. As these stones are found chiefly in the Gandak\nriver, the Salagrama Tirtha was probably at the source of that stream, or at\nits confluence with the Ganges. Its sanctity, and that of the stone, are\nprobably of comparatively modern origin.\n\n[163:7](vp058.htm#fr_370) \'The great road,\' or \'road of heroes.\' The pebble\nwas intended either to compel perpetual silence, or to prevent his eating. The\nBhagavata p. 164 adverts to the same circumstance. That work enters much more\ninto detail on the subject of Rishabha\'s devotion, and particularizes\ncircumstances not found in any other Puran\xcc\x81a. The most interesting of these\nare the scene of Rishabha\'s wanderings, which is said to be Konka, Venkat\xcc\x81a,\nKut\xcc\x81aka, and southern Karnataka, or the western part of the Peninsula; and the\nadoption of the Jain belief by the people of those countries. Thus it is said,\n"A king of the Konkas, Venkat\xcc\x81as, and Kut\xcc\x81akas, named Arhat, having heard the\ntradition of Rishabha\'s practices (or his wandering about naked, and desisting\nfrom religious rites), being infatuated by necessity, under the evil influence\nof the Kali age, will become needlessly alarmed, and abandon his own religious\nduty, and will foolishly enter upon an unrighteous and heretical path. Misled\nby him, and bewildered by the iniquitous operation of the Kali age, disturbed\nalso by the delusions of the deity, wicked men will, in great numbers, desert\nthe institutes and purifications of their own ritual; will observe vows\ninjurious and disrespectful to the gods; will desist from ablutions, mouth-\nwashings, and purifications, and will pluck out the hair of the head; and will\nrevile the world, the deity, sacrifices, Brahmans, and the Vedas." It is also\nsaid, that Sumati, the son of Bharata, will be irreligiously worshipped by\nsome infidels, as a divinity. Besides the import of the term Arhat, or Jain,\nRishabha is the name of the first, and Sumati of the fifth Tirthakara, or Jain\nsaint of the present era. There can be no doubt, therefore, that the Bhagavata\nintends this sect; and as the Jain system was not matured until a\ncomparatively modern date, this composition is determined to be also recent.\nThe allusions to the extension of the Jain faith in the western parts of the\nPeninsula, may serve to fix the limit of its probable antiquity to the 11th or\n12th century, when the Jains seem to have been flourishing in Guzerat and the\nKonkan. As. Res. XVII. 232.\n\n[164:8](vp058.htm#fr_371) This etymology is given in other Puran\xcc\x81as; but the\nMatsya and Vayu have a different one, deriving it from the Manu, called\nBharata, or the cherisher, one who rears or cherishes progeny. The Vayu has,\nin another place, the more common explanation also: ###.\n\n[165:9](vp058.htm#fr_372) The Agni, Kurma, Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya, Linga, and Vayu\nPuran\xcc\x81as agree with the Vishn\xcc\x81u in these genealogical details. The Bhagavata\nhas some additions and variations of nomenclature, but is not essentially\ndifferent. It ends, however, with \xc5\x9aatajit, and cites a stanza which would seem\nto make Viraja the last of the descendants of Priyavrata.\n\n[165:10](vp058.htm#fr_373) The descendants of Priyavrata were the kings of the\nearth in the first or Swayambhuva Manwantara. Those of Uttanapada, his\nbrother, are placed rather incongruously in the second or Swarochisha\nManwantara: whilst, with still more palpable inconsistency, Daksha, a\ndescendant of Uttanapada, gives his daughter to Ka\xc5\x9byapa in the seventh or\nVaivaswata Manwantara. It seems probable that the patriarchal genealogies are\nolder than the chronological system of Manwantaras and Kalpas, and have been\nrather clumsily distributed amongst the different periods.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter II](vp059.htm)\n\n'
