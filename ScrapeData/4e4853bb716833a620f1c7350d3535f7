Dost thou know me?" Now as long as his speech is not\n\np. 108\n\nmerged in his mind, his mind in breath, breath in heat (fire), heat in the\nHighest Being (devata), he knows them.\n\n2\\. \'But when his speech is merged in his mind, his mind in breath, breath in\nheat (fire), heat in the Highest Being, then he knows them not.\n\n\'That which is the subtile essence, in it all that exists has its self. It is\nthe True. It is the Self, and thou, O _S_ vetaketu, art it.\'\n\n\'Please, Sir, inform me still more,\' said the son.\'\n\n\'Be it so, my child,\' the father replied.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[107:2](sbe01133.htm#fr_300) The question supposed to be asked is: By what\ndegrees a man, who has been properly instructed in the knowledge of Brahman,\nobtains the Sat, or returns to the True. To judge from the text both he who\nknows the True and he who does not, reach, when they die, the Sat, passing\nfrom speech to mind and breath and heat (fire). But whereas he who knows,\nremains in the Sat, they who do not p. 108 know, return again to a new form of\nexistence. It is important to observe that the commentator denies that he who\nknows, passes at his death through the artery of the head to the sun, and then\nto the Sat. He holds that with him who knows there is no further cause for\ndelay, and that as soon as he dies, he returns to the Sat.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 16](sbe01134.htm)\n\n'
