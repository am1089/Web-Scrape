Thy auspicious face, O mighty Agni, shines in the neighbourhood of the sun\n[1](sbe46100.htm#an_4:11:1:1). Brilliant to see, it is seen even by night.\nSoft to behold is the food in thy (beautiful) body\n[2](sbe46100.htm#an_4:11:1:2).\n\n2\\. O Agni, disclose (wise) thoughts for him who praises thee; (disclose) the\nopening, when thou, O strong-born, hast been praised with trembling. Grant\nunto us, O very great one, such a rich prayer as thou with all the gods wilt\nhold dear, O brilliant one.\n\n3\\. From thee, O Agni, genius is born, from thee (wise) thoughts, from thee\nbeneficent hymns. From thee comes wealth adorned with heroes\n[1](sbe46100.htm#an_4:11:3:1) to the thus-minded mortal who worships thee.\n\n4\\. From thee the racer is born that wins booty, whose energy expands round-\nabout [1](sbe46100.htm#an_4:11:4:1), the helpful, of true strength; from thee\ndelightful wealth sent by the gods; from thee, O Agni, the swift and impetuous\nhorse.\n\n5\\. Thee, O Agni, the pious mortals seek to win by their prayers as the first,\nthee the god with agreeable speech, O immortal, who drivest away malice, the\nhousehold god, the lord of the house, the wise one.\n\n6\\. (Drive) far from us senselessness and anguish; (drive) far all ill-will\nfrom him whom thou attendest [1](sbe46100.htm#an_4:11:6:1). Be gracious at\nevening, Agni, son of strength, to him whom thou, the god, attendest with\nwelfare.\n\np. 353\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi. Metre, Trish _t_ ubh.--Verse 1 = TS. IV, 3, 13, 1.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Comp. above, IV, 10, 5. ro _k_ ate upake.\n\nNote 2. Literally, 'in thy appearance' (rupe). Thus the Soma is stated, IX,\n16, 6, to purify itself rupe avyaye, literally, 'in the appearance of the\nsheep,' i. e. in the filter made of sheep's hair.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. See Lanman, p. 560; Pischel, Ved. Studien, II, 115.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. On vihaya _h_ , see V. Henry, Les livres VIII et IX de l'Atharva-veda\n(1894), p. 40 (AV. VIII, 2, 7).\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Probably the correct Padapa _th_ a reading would be, as Prof.\nBartholomae (Bezzenberger's Beitrage, XV, 190) has noticed, yam nipa\xc2\xb4si (cf.\nPada d: yam \xe2\x80\xa6 sa _k_ ase). If yat is correct, the translation will be:\n'(drive) far all ill-will when thou protectest (us).'--Bartholomae proposes\neither to change asmat to asmat, or to interpret it as an equivalent of asmat.\nIt is possible, though in my opinion not very probable, that the text should\nbe changed. The ablative asmat very frequently depends on are.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 12](sbe46101.htm)\n\n"
