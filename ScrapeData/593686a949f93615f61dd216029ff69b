Dutt, [1899], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n# RAMAYANA BOOK X\n\n# YUDDHA\n\n_\n\n(The War in Ceylon)\n\n_\n\nRAMA crossed over with his army from India to Ceylon. There is a chain of\nislands across the strait, and the Indian poet supposes them to be the remains\nof a vast causeway which Rama built to cross over with his army.\n\nThe town of Lanka, the capital of Ceylon, was invested, and the war which\nfollowed was a succession of sallies by the great leaders and princes of\nLanka. But almost every sally was repulsed, every chief was killed, and at\nlast Ravan himself who made the last sally was slain and the war ended.\n\nAmong the numberless fights described in the original work, those of Ravan\nhimself, his brother Kumbha-karna, and his son Indrajit, are the most\nimportant, and oftenest recited and listened to in India; and these have been\nrendered into English in this Book. And the reader will mark a certain method\nin the poet\'s estimate of the warriors who took part in these battles.\n\nFirst and greatest among the warriors was Rama; he was never beaten by an open\nfoe, never conquered in fair fight. Next to him, and to him only, was Ravan\nthe monarch of Lanka; he twice defeated Lakshman in battle, and never\nretreated except before Rama. Next to Rama and to Ravan stood their brothers,\nLaksh man and Kumbha-karna; it is difficult to say who was the best of these\ntwo, for they fought only once, and it was a drawn battle. Fifth in order of\nprowess was Indrajit the son of Ravana, but he was the first in his magic art.\nConcealed in mists by his magic, he twice defeated both Rama and Lakshman; but\nin his last battle he had to wage a face to face combat with Lakshman, and was\nslain. After these five warriors, pre-eminent for their prowess, various\nVanars and Rakshas took their rank.\n\nThe war ended with the fall of Ravan and his funerals.

Ayodhya\'s monarch! Queen Kausalya\'s dearest born  \nRama soul of truth and virtue sleeps the sleep that knows no morn!"\n\nSorely wept the sorrowing Sita in her accents soft and low,  \nAnd the silent stars of midnight wept to witness Sita\'s woe,\n\nBut Trijata her companion,--though a Raksha woman she,--  \nFelt her soul subdued by sadness, spake to Sita tenderly:\n\n"Weep not, sad and saintly Sita, shed not widow\'s tears in vain,  \nFor thy lord is sorely wounded, but shall live to fight again,\n\nRama and the gallant Lakshman, fainting, not bereft of life,  \nThey shall live to fight and conquer,--thou shalt be a happy wife,\n\nMark the Vanars\' marshalled forces, listen to their warlike cries,  \n\'Tis not thus the soldiers gather when a chief and hero dies,\n\n\'Tis not thus round lifeless leader muster warriors true and brave,  \nFor when falls the dying helmsman, sinks the vessel in the wave!\n\nMark the ring of hopeful Vanars, how they watch o\'er Rama\'s face,  \nHow they guard the younger Lakshman beaming yet with living grace,\n\nTrust me, sad and sorrowing Sita, marks of death these eyes can trace,  \nShade of death\'s decaying fingers sweeps not o\'er thy Rama\'s face!\n\nListen more, my gentle Sita, though a captive in our keep,  \nFor thy woes and for thy anguish see a Raksha woman weep,\n\nThough thy Rama armed in battle is our unrelenting foe,  \nFor a true and stainless warrior see a Raksha filled with woe!\n\nFainting on the field of battle, blood-ensanguined in their face,  \nThey shall live to fight and conquer, worthy of their gallant race,\n\nCold nor rigid are their features, darkness dwells not on their brow,  \nWeep not thus, my gentle Sita,--hasten we to Lanka now."\n\nAnd Trijata spake no falsehood, by the winged Garuda\'s skill,  \nRama and the valiant Lakshman lived to fight their foemen still!\n\n## III\n\n## RAVAN\'S FIRST BATTLE-THE JAVELIN-STROKE\n\n\'Gainst the God-assisted Rama, Ravan\'s efforts all were vain,  \nLeaguered Lanka vainly struggled in her adamantine chain,\n\nWrathful Rakshas with their forces vainly issued through the gate,  \nChiefs and serried ranks of warriors met the same resistless fate!\n\nDark-eyed chief Dhumraksha sallied with the fierce tornado\'s shock,  \nHanuman of peerless prowess slayed him with a rolling rock,\n\nIron-toothed Vajra-danshtra dashed through countless Vanars slain,  \nBut the young and gallant Angad laid him lifeless on the plain,\n\nAkampan unshaken warrior issued out of Lanka\'s wall,  \nHanuman was true and watchful, speedy was the Raksha\'s fall,\n\nThen the mighty-armed Prahasta strove to break the hostile line,  \nBut the gallant Nila felled him as the woodman fells the pine!\n\nBravest chiefs and countless soldiers sallied forth to face the fight,  \nBroke not Rama\'s iron circle, \'scaped not Rama\'s wondrous might,\n\nRavan could no longer tarry, for his mightiest chiefs were slain,  \nForemost leaders, dearest kinsmen, lying on the gory plain!\n\n"Lofty scorn of foes unworthy spared them from my flaming ire,  \nBut the blood of slaughtered kinsmen claims from me a vengeance dire,"\n\nSpeaking thus the wrathful Ravan mounted on his thundering car,  \nFlame-resplendent was the chariot drawn by matchless steeds of war!\n\nBeat of drum and voice of sankha and the Raksha\'s battle cry,  \nSong of triumph, chanted mantra, smote the echoing vault of sky,\n\nAnd the troops like cloudy masses with their eyes of lightning fire  \nGirt their monarch, as his legions girdle RUDRA in his ire!\n\nRolled the car with peal of thunder through the city\'s lofty gate,  \nAnd each fierce and fiery Raksha charged with warrior\'s deathless hate,\n\nAnd the vigour of the onset cleft the stunned and scattered foe,  \nAs a strong bark cleaves the billows riding on the ocean\'s brow!\n\nBrave Sugriva king of Vanars met the foeman fierce and strong,  \nAnd a rock with mighty effort on the startled Ravan flung,\n\nVain the toil, disdainful Ravan dashed aside the flying rock,  \nBrave Sugriva pierced by arrows fainted neath the furious shock.\n\nNext Susena chief and elder, Nala and Gavaksha bold,  \nHurled them on the path of Ravan speeding in his car of gold,\n\nVainly heaved the rock and missile, vainly did with trees assail,  \nOnward sped the conquering Ravan, pierced the fainting Vanars fell.\n\nHanuman the son of MARUT next against the Raksha came,  \nFierce and strong as stormy MARUT, warrior of unrivalled fame,\n\nBut the Raksha\'s mighty onset gods nor mortals might sustain,  \nHauuman in red blood welt\'ring rolled upon the gory plain.\n\nOnward rolled the car of Ravan, where the dauntless Nila stood,  \nArmed with rock and tree and missile, thirsting for the Raksha\'s blood,\n\nVainly fought the valiant Nila, pierced by Ravan\'s pointed dart,  \nOn the gory field of battle poured the red blood of his heart.\n\nOnward through the scattered forces Ravan\'s conquering chariot came,  \nWhere in pride mid dauntless valour Lakshman stood of warlike fame,\n\nCalm and proud the gallant Lakshman marked the all-resistless foe,  \nBoldly challenged Lanka\'s monarch as he held aloft his bow:\n\n"Welcome, mighty Lord of Lanka! wage with me an equal strife,  \nWherefore with thy royal prowess seek the humble Vanars\' life!"\n\n"Hath thy fate," so answered Ravan, "brought thee to thy deadly foe,  \nWelcome, valiant son of Ra-hu! Ravan longs to lay thee low!\n\nThen they closed in dubious battle, Lanka\'s Lord his weapon bent,  \nSeven bright arrows, keen and whistling, on the gallant Lakshman sent,\n\nVain the toil, for watchful Lakshman stout of heart and true of aim,  \nWith his darts like shooting sunbeams cleft each arrow as it came.\n\nBleeding from the darts of Lakshman, pale with anger, wounded sore,  \nRavan drew at last his Sakti, gift of Gods in days of yore,\n\nJavelin of flaming splendour, deadly like the shaft of Fate,  \nRavan hurled on dauntless Lakshman in his fierce and furious hate.\n\nVain were Lakshman\'s human weapons aimed with skill-directed well,  \nPierced by Sakti, gallant Lakshman in his red blood fainting fell,\n\nWrathful Rama saw the combat and arose in godlike might,  \nBleeding Ravan turned to Lanka, sought his safety in his flight.\n\n## IV\n\n## FALL OF KUMBHA-KARNA\n\nOnce, more healed and strong and valiant, Lakshman in his arms, arose,  \nSafe behind the gates of Lanka humbled Ravan shunned his foes,\n\nTill the stalwart Kumbha-karna from his wonted slumbers woke,  \nMightiest be of all the Rakshas;--Ravan thus unto him spoke.\n\n"Thou alone, O Kumbha-karna, can the Raksha\'s honour save,  \nStrongest of the Raksha warriors, stoutest-hearted midst the brave,\n\nSpeed thee like the Dread Destroyer to the dark and dubious fray,  \nCleave through Rama\'s girdling forces, chase the scattered foe away!"\n\nLike a mountain\'s beetling turret Kumbha-karna stout and tall,  \nPassed the city\'s lofty portals and the city\'s girdling wall,\n\nAnd he raised his voice in battle, sent his cry from shore to shore,  \nSolid mountains shook and trembled and the sea returned the roar!\n\nINDRA nor the great VARUNA equalled Kumbha-karna\'s might,  \nVanars trembled at the warrior, sought their safety in their flight,\n\nBut the prince of fair Kishkindha, Angad chief of warlike fame,  \nMarked his panic-stricken forces with a princely warrior\'s shame.\n\n"Whither fly, ye trembling Vanars?" thus the angry chieftain cried,  \n"All forgetful of your duty, of your worth and warlike pride,\n\nDeem not stalwart Kumbha-karna is our match in open fight,  \nForward let us meet in battle, let us crush his giant might!"\n\nRallied thus, the broken army stone and tree and massive rock.  \nHurled upon the giant Raksha speeding with the lightning\'s shock.\n\nVain each flying rock and missile, vain each stout and sturdy stroke,  \nOn the Raksha\'s limbs of iron stone and tree in splinters broke.\n\nDashing through the scattered forces Kumbha-karna fearless stood,  \nAs a forest conflagration feasts upon the parched wood,\n\nFar as confines of the ocean, to the causeway they had made,  \nTo the woods or caves or billows, Vanars in their terror fled!\n\nHanuman of dauntless valour turned not in his fear nor fled,  \nHeaved a rock with mighty effort on the Raksha\'s towering held,\n\nWith his spear-head Kumbha-karna dashed the flying rock aside,  \nBy the Raksha\'s weapon stricken Hanuman fell in his pride.\n\nNext Rishabha and brave Nila and the bold Sarabha came,  \nGavaksha and Gandha-madan, chieftains of a deathless fame,\n\nBut the spear of Kunibha-karna hurled to earth his feeble foes,  \nDreadful was the field of carnage, loud the cry of battle rose!\n\nAngad prince of fair Kishkindha, filled with anger and with shame,  \nTore a rock with wrathful prowess, to the fatal combat came,\n\nShort the combat, soon the Raksha caught and turned his foe around  \nHurled him in his deadly fury, bleeding, senseless on the ground!\n\nLast, Sugriva king of Vanars with a vengeful anger woke,  \nTore a rock from bed of mountain and in proud defiance spoke,\n\nVain Sugriva\'s toil and struggle, Kumbha-karna hurled a rock,  \nFell Suguriva crushed and senseless \'neath the missile\'s mighty shock!\n\nPiercing through the Vanar forces, like a flame through forest wood,  \nCame the Raksha where in glory Lakshman calm and fearless stood,\n\nShort their contest,-Kumbha-karna sought a greater, mightier foe,  \nTo the young and dauntless Lakshman spake in accents soft and low:\n\n"Dauntless prince and matchless warrior, fair Sumitra\'s gallant son,  \nThou hast proved unrivalled prowess and unending glory won,\n\nBut I seek a mightier foeman, to thy elder let me go,  \nI would fight the royal Rama, or to die or slay my foe!"\n\n_\n\n"Victor proud!" said gallant Lakshman, "peerless in thy giant might,  \nConqueror of great Immortals, Lakshman owns thy skill in fight,\n\nMightier foe than bright Immortals thou shall meet in fatal war,  \nDeath for thee in guise of Rama tarries yonder, not afar!"\n\n_\n\nIll it fared with Kumbha-karna when he strove with Rama\'s might,  \nMen on earth nor Gods immortal conquered Rama in the fight,\n\nDeadly arrows keen and flaming from the hero\'s weapon broke,  \nKumbha-karna faint and bleeding felt his death at every stroke,\n\nLast, an arrow pierced his armour, from his shoulders smote his head,  \nKumbha-karna, lifeless, headless, rolled upon the gory bed,\n\nHurled unto the heaving ocean Kumbha-karna\'s body fell,  \nAnd as shaken by a tempest, mighty was the ocean\'s swell!\n\n## V\n\n## INDRJIT\'S SACRIFICE AND SECOND BATTLE\n\nStill around beleaguered Lanka girdled Rama\'s living chain,  \nRaksha chieftain after chieftain strove to break the line in vain,\n\nSons of Ravan,--brave Narantak was by valiant Angad slain,  \nTrisiras and fierce Devantak, Hanuman slew on the plain,\n\nAtikaya, tall of stature, was by gallant Lakshman killed,  \nRavan wept for slaughtered princes, brave in war in weapons skilled.\n\n"Shed no tears of sorrow, father! "Indrajit exclaimed in pride,  \n"While thy eldest son surviveth triumph dwells on Ravan\'s side,\n\nRama and that stripling Lakshman, I had left them in their gore,  \nOnce again I seek their lifeblood,--they shall live to fight no more.\n\nHear my vow, O Lord of Rakshas! ere descends yon radiant sun,  \nRama\'s days and gallant Lakshman\'s on this wide earth shall be done,\n\nWitness INDRA and VIVASWAT, VISHNU great and RUDRA dire,  \nWitness Sun and Moon and Sadhyas, and the living God of Fire!\n\nOpened wide the gates of Lanka; in the spacious field of war,  \nIndrajit arranged his army, foot and horse and battle car,\n\nThen with gifts and sacred _mantras_ bent before the God of Fire,  \nAnd invoked celestial succour in the battle dread and dire.\n\nWith his offerings and his garlands, Indrajit with spices rare,  \nWorshipped holy VAISWA-NARA on the altar bright and fair,\n\nSpear and mace were ranged in order, dart and bow and shining blade  \nSacred fuel, blood-red garments, fragrant flowers were duly laid,\n\nHead of goat as black as midnight offered then the warrior brave,  \nAnd the shooting tongue of red fire omens of a conquest gave,\n\nCurling to the right and smokeless, red and bright as molten gold,  \nTongue of flame received the offering of the hero true and bold!\n\nVictory the sign betokens! Bow and dart and shining blade,  \nSanctified by holy _mantras_ , by the Fire the warrior laid,\n\nThen with weapons consecrated, hid in mists as once before,  \nIndrajit on helpless foemen did his fatal arrows pour!\n\nFled the countless Vanar forces, panic-stricken, crushed and slain,  \nAnd the dead and dying warriors strewed the gory battle plain,\n\nThen on Rama, and on Lakshman, from his dark and misty shroud,  \nIndrajit discharged his arrows bright as sunbeams through a cloud.\n\nScanning earth and bright sky vainly for his dark and hidden foe,  \nRama to his brother Lakshman spake in grief and spake in woe:\n\nOnce again that wily Raksha, slaying all our Vanar train,  \nFrom his dark and shadowy shelter doth on us his arrows rain,\n\nBy the grace of great SWAYAMBHU, Indrajit is lost to sight,  \nUseless is our human weapon \'gainst his gift of magic might.\n\nIf SWAYAMBHU wills it, Lakshman, we shall face these fatal darts,  \nWe shall stand with dauntless patience, we shall die with dauntless hearts!"\n\nWeaponless but calm and valiant, from the foeman\'s dart and spell  \npatiently the princes suffered, fearlessly the heroes fell!\n\n## VI\n\n## INDRAJIT\'S THIRD BATTLE AND FALL\n\nHealing herbs from distant mountains Hanuman in safety brought,  \nRama rose and gallant Lakshman, once again their foemen sought.\n\nAnd when night its sable mantle o\'er the earth and ocean drew,  \nForcing through the gates of Lanka to the frightened city flew!\n\nGallant sons of Kumbha-kama vainly fought to stem the tide,  \nHanuman and brave Sugriva slew the brothers in their pride,\n\nMakaraksha, shark-eyed warrior, vainly struggled with the foe,  \nRama laid him pierced and lifeless by an arrow from his bow.\n\nIndrajit arose in anger for his gallant kinsmen slayed,  \nIn his arts and deep devices Sita\'s beauteous image made,\n\nAnd he placed the form of beauty on his speeding battle car,  \nWith his sword he smote the image in the gory field of war!\n\nRama heard the fatal message which his faithful Vanars gave,  \nAnd a deathlike trance and tremor fell upon the warrior brave,\n\nBut Bibhishan deep in wisdom to the anguished Rama came,  \nWith his words of consolation spake of Rama\'s righteous dame:\n\n"Trust me, Rama, trust thy comrade,--for I know our wily house,--  \nIndrajit slays not the woman whom his father seeks as spouse,\n\n\'Tis for Sita, impious Ravan meets thee on the battle-field,  \nStakes his life and throne and empire, but thy Sita will not yield,\n\nDeem not that the king of Rakshas will permit her blood be shed,  \nIndrajit slays not the woman whom his father seeks to wed!\n\n\'Twas an image of thy Sita, Indrajit hath cleft in twain,  \nWhile our army wails and sorrows,--he performs his rites again,\n\nTo the holy Nikumbhila, Indrajit in secret hies,  \nFor the rights which yield him prowess, hide him in the cloudy skies.\n\nLet young Lakshman seek the foeman ere his magic rites be done,  \nOnce the sacrifice completed, none can combat Ravan\'s son,--\n\nLet young Lakshman speed through Lanka till his wily foe is found,  \nSlay the secret sacrificer on the sacrificial ground!"\n\nUnto holy Nikumbhila, Lakshman with Bibhishan went  \nBravest, choicest of the army, Rama with his brother sent,\n\nMagic rites and sacrifices Indrajit had scarce begun,  \nWhen surprised by armed foemen rose in anger Ravan\'s son!\n\n"Art thou he," thus to Bibhishan, Indrajit in anger spake,  \n"Brother of my royal father, stealing thus my life to take,\n\nRaksha born of Raksha parents, dost thou glory in this deed,  \nTraitor to thy king and kinsmen, false to us in direst need?\n\nScorn and pity fill my bosom thus to see thee leave thy kin,  \nServing as a slave of foemen, stooping to a deed of sin,\n\nFor the slave who leaves his kindred, basely seeks the foemans grace,  \nMeets destruction from the foeman after he destroys his race!"\n\n"Untaught child of impure passions," thus Bibhishan answer made,  \n"Of my righteous worth unconscious bitter accents hast thou said,\n\nKnow, proud youth, that Truth and Virtue in my heart precedence take,  \nAnd we shun the impious kinsman as we shun the pois\'nous snake!\n\n_\n\nListen, youth! this earth no longer bears thy father\'s sin and strife,  \nPlunder of the righteous neighbour, passion for the neighbour\'s wife,\n\nEarth and skies have doomed thy father for his sin-polluted reign,  \nUnto Gods his proud defiance and his wrongs to sons of men!\n\nListen more! this fated Lanka groans beneath her load of crime,  \nAnd shall perish in her folly by the ruthless hand of Time,\n\nThou shalt perish and thy father and this proud presumptuous state,  \nLakshman meets thee, impious Raksha, by the stern decree of Fate!"\n\n_\n\n"Hast thou too forgot the lesson," Indrajit to Lakshman said,  \n"Twice in field of war unconscious thee with Rama have I laid,\n\nDost thou stealing like a serpent brave my yet unconquered might,  \nPerish, boy, in thy presumption, in this last and fatal fight!"\n\nSpake the hero: "Like a coward hid beneath a mantling cloud,  \nThou hast battled like a caitiff safe behind thy sheltering shroud,\n\nNow I seek an open combat, time is none to prate or speak,  \nBoastful word is coward\'s weapon, weapons and thy arrows seek!\n\nSoon they mixed in dubious combat, fury fired each foeman\'s heart,  \nEither warrior felt his rival worthy of his bow and dart,\n\nLakshman with his hurtling arrows pierced the Raksha\'s golden mail,  \nShattered by the Raksha\'s weapons Lakshman\'s useless armour fen,\n\nRed with gore and dim in eyesight still the chiefs in fury fought,  \nNeither quailed bef ore his f oeman, pause nor grace nor mercy sought,\n\nTill with more than human valour Lakshman drew his bow amain,  \nSlayed the Raksha\'s steeds and driver, severed too his bow in twain.\n\n"If the great and godlike Rama is in faith and duty true,  \nGods assist the cause of virtue!"--Lakahman uttered as he drew,\n\nFatal was the dart unerring,--Gods assist the true and bold,  \nOn the field of Nikumbhila, Lakshman\'s foeman headless rolled!\n\n## VII\n\n## RAVAN\'S LAMENT\n\n"Quenched the light of Rakshas\' valour!" so the message-bearer said,  \n"Lakshman with the deep Bibhishan hath thy son in battle slayed,\n\nFallen is our prince and hero and his day on earth is done,  \nIn a brighter world, O monarch, lives thy brave, thy gallant son!\n\nAnguish filled the father\'s bosom and his fleeting senses failed,  \nTill to deeper sorrow wakened Lanka\'s monarch wept and wailed:\n\n"Greatest of my gallant warriors, dearest to thy father\'s heart.,  \nVictor over bright Immortals,- art thou slain by Lakshman\'s dart,\n\nNoble prince whose peerless arrows could the peaks of Mandar stain,  \nAnd could daunt the Dread Destroyer,--art thou by a mortal slain!\n\nBut thy valour lends a radiance to elysium\'s sunny clime,  \nAnd thy bright name adds a lustre to the glorious rolls of time,\n\nIn the skies the bright Immortals lisp thy name with terror pale,  \nOn the earth our maids and matrons mourn thy fall with piercing wail!\n\nHark! the voice of lamentation waking in the palace halls,  \nLike the voice of woe in forests when the forest monarch falls,\n\nHark! the wailing widowed princess, mother weeping for her son,  \nLeaving them in tears and anguish, Indrajit, where art thou gone!\n\nFull of years,--so oft I pondered,--when the monarch Ravan dics,  \nIndrajit shall watch his bedside, Indrajit shall close his eyes,\n\nBut the course of nature changes, and the father weeps the son,  \nYouth is fallen, and the aged lives to fight the foe alone!"\n\nTears of sorrow, slow and silent, fell upon the monarch\'s breast,  \nThen a swelling rage and passion woke within his heaving chest,\n\nLike the sun of scorching summer glowed his face in wrathful shame,  \nFrom his brow and rolling eyeballs issued sparks of living flame!\n\n"Perish she!" exclaimed the monarch, "she-wolf Sita dies to-day,  \nIndrajit but cleft her image, Ravan will the woman slay!"\n\nFollowed by his trembling courtiers, regal robes and garments rent,  \nRavan shaking in his passion to Asoka\'s garden went,\n\nMaddened by his wrath and anguish, with his drawn and flaming sword,  \nSought the shades where soft-eyed Sita, silent sorrowed for her lord.\n\nWoman\'s blood the royal sabre on that fatal day had stained,  \nBut his true and faithful courtiers Ravan\'s wrathful hand restrained.\n\nAnd the watchful Raksha females girdled round the sorrowing dame,  \nFlung them on the path of Ravan to withstand a deed of shame.\n\n"Not against a woman, Ravan, mighty warriors raise their hand,  \nIn the battle," spake the courtiers, "duty bids thee use thy brand,\n\nVersed in _Vedas_ and in learning, court not thus a caitiff\'s fate,  \nWoman\'s blood pollutes our valour, closes heaven\'s eternal gate!\n\nLeave the woman in her sorrow, mount upon thy battle car,  \nFaithful to our king and leader we will wake the voice of war,\n\n\'Tis the fourteenth day auspicious of the dark and waning moon,  \nGlory waiteth thee in battle and thy vengeance cometh soon,\n\nAll-resistless in the contest slay thy foeman in his pride,  \nSeek as victor of the combat widowed Sita as thy bride!"\n\nSlow and sullen, dark and silent, Ravan then his wrath restrained,  \nVengeance on his son\'s destroyer deep within his bosom reigned!\n\n## VIII\n\n## RAVAN\'S SECOND BATTLE AND VENGEANCE\n\nVoice of woe and lamentation and the cry of woman\'s wail,  \nIssuing from the homes of Lanka did the monarch\'s ears awail,\n\nAnd a mighty thought of vengeance waked within the monarch\'s heart,  \nAnd he heaved a sigh of anguish as he grasped his bow and dart:\n\n"Arm each chief and gallant Raksha! be our sacred duty done,  \nRavan seeks a fitting vengeance for his brave and noble son,\n\nMahodar and Virupaksha, Mahaparshwa warrior tall,  \nArm! this fated day will witness Lakshman\'s or your monarch\'s fall\n\nCall to mind each slaughtered hero,--Khara, Dushan, slain in fight,  \nKumbha-kama giant warrior, Indrajit of magic might,\n\nEarth nor sky shall hide my foemen nor the ocean\'s heaving swell,  \nScattered ranks of Rama\'s forces shall my speedy vengeance tell,\n\nBe the red-earth strewn and covered with our countless foemen slain,  \nHungry wolves and blood-beaked vultures feed upon the ghastly plain,\n\nFor his great and gallant brother, for his brave and beauteous son,  \nRavan seeks a fitting vengeance, Rakshas be your duty done!"\n\nHouse to house, in Lanka\'s city, Ravan\'s royal best was heard,  \nStreet and lane poured forth their warriors by a mighty passion stirred,\n\nWith the javelin and sabre, mace and club and axe and pike,  \n_Sataghni_ and _bhindipala_ , quoit and discus quick to strike.\n\nAnd they formed the line of tuskers and the line of battle car,  \nMule and camel fit for burden and the fiery steed of war,\n\nSerried ranks of armed soldiers shook the earth beneath their tread,  \nHorsemen that on wings of lightning o\'er the field of battle spread.\n\nDrum and conch and sounding trumpet waked the echoes of the sky,  \n_Pataha_ and loud _mridanga_ and the people\'s maddening cry,\n\nThundering through the gates of Lanka, Ravan\'s lofty chariot passed  \nDestined by his fortune, Ravan ne\'er again those portals crost!\n\nAnd the sun was dim and clouded and a sudden darkness fell,  \nBirds gave forth their boding voices and the earth confessed a spell,\n\nGouts of blood in rain descended, startled coursers turned to fly,  \nVultures swooped upon the banner, jackals yelled their doleful cry,\n\nOmens of a dark disaster mantled o\'er the vale and rock,  \nAnd the ocean heaved in billows, nations felt the earthquake shock!\n\nDarkly closed the fatal battle, sturdy Vanars fell in fight,  \nWarlike leaders of the Rakshas perished neath the foeman\'s might,\n\nMahodhar and Virupaksha were by bold Sugriva slain,  \nCrushed by Angad, Mahaparshwa. slumbered lifeless on the plain.\n\nBut with more than mortal valour Ravan swept the ranks of war,  \nWarriors fell beneath his prowess, fled before his mighty car,\n\nCleaving through the Vanar forces, filled with vengeance deep and dire,  \nRavan marked the gallant Lakshman flaming like a crimson fire!\n\nLike the tempest cloud of summer Ravan\'s winged courses flew,  \nBut Bibhishan in his prowess soon the gallant charges slew,\n\nDashina from his useless chariot Ravan leaped upon the ground,  \nAnd his false and traitor brother by his dearest foeman found!\n\nWrathful Ravan marked Bibhishan battling by the foeman\'s side,  \nAnd he hurled his pond\'rous weapon for to slay him in his pride,\n\nLakshman marked the mighty jav\'lin as it winged its whizzing flight,  \nCleft it in its onward passage, saved Bibhishan by his might!\n\nGrimly smiled the angry Ravan gloating in his vengeful wrath,  \nSpake to young and dauntless Laksliman daring thus to cross his path:\n\nWelcome, Lakshman! thee I battle for thy deed of darkness done,  \nFace the anger of a father, cruel slayer of the son,\n\nBy thy skill and by thy valour, false Bibhishan thou hast saved,  \nSave thyself! Deep in this bosom is a cruel grief engraved!"\n\nFather\'s grief and sad remembrance urged the lightning-winged dart,  \nRavan\'s _Sakti_ fell resistless on the senseless Lakshman\'s heart,\n\nWrathful Rama saw the combat and arose in godlike might,  \nCarless, steedless, wounded Ravan sought his safety in his flight.\n\n## IX\n\n## RAMA\'s LAMENT\n\n"Art thou fallen," sorrowed Rama, "weary of this endless strife,  \nLakshman, if thy days are ended, Rama recks not for his life,\n\nGone is Rama\'s wonted valour, weapons leave his nerveless hand,  \nDrop his bow and shining arrows, useless hangs his sheathed brand!\n\nArt thou fallen, gallant Lakshman, death and faintness on me creep,  \nWeary of this fatal contest let me by my brother sleep,\n\nWeary of the strife and triumph, since my faithful friend is gone,  \nRama follows in his footsteps and his task on earth is done!\n\nThou hast from the far Ayodhya, followed me in deepest wood,  \nIn the thickest of the battle thou hast by thy elder stood,\n\nLove of woman, love of comrade, trite is love of kith and kind,  \nLove like thine, true-hearted brother, not on earth we often find!\n\nWhen Sumitra seeks thee, Lakshman, ever weeping for thy sake,  \nWhen she asks me of her hero, what reply shall Rama make,\n\nWhat reply, when Bharat questions,--Where is be who went to wood,  \nWhere is true and faithful Lakshman who beside his elder stood?\n\nWhat great crime or fatal shadow darkens o\'er my hapless life,  \nVictim to the sins of Rama sinless Lakshman falls in strife,\n\nBest of brothers, best of warriors, wherefore thus unconscious he,  \nMother, wife, and brother wait thee, ope once more thy sleeping eye!"\n\nTara\'s father, wise Susena, gentle consolation lent,  \nHanuman from distant mountains herbs of healing virtue rent,\n\nAnd by loving Rama tended, Lakshman in his strength arose,  \nStirred by thoughts of fatal vengeance Rama sought the flying foes.\n\n## X\n\n## CELESTIAL ARMS AND CHARIOT\n\nNot in dastard terror havan sought his safety in his flight,  \nBut to seek fresh steeds of battle ere he faced his foeman\'s might,\n\nHarnessing his gallant coursers to a new and glorious car,  \nSunlike in its radiant splendour, Ravan came once more to war.\n\nGods in wonder watched the contest of the more than mortal foes,  \nRavan mighty in his vengeance, Rama lofty in his woes,\n\nGods in wonder marked the heroes, lion-like in jungle wood,  \nINDRA sent his arms and chariot where the human warrior stood!\n\n_\n\n"Speed, Matali," thus spake INDRA, "speed thee with my heavenly car,  \nWhere on foot the righteous Rama meets his mounted foe in war,\n\nSpeed, for Ravan\'s days are ended, and his moments brief and few,  \nRama strives for right and virtue,--Gods assist the brave and true!"\n\n_\n\nBrave Matali drove the chariot drawn by steeds like solar ray,  \nWhere the true and righteous Rama sought his foe in fatal fray,\n\nShining arms and heavenly weapons he to lofty Rama gave,--  \nWhen the righteous strive and struggle, Gods assist the true and brave!\n\n"Take this car," so said Matali, "which the helping Gods provide,  \nRama, take these steeds celestial, INDRA\'S golden chariot ride,\n\nTake this royal bow and quiver, wear this falchion dread and dire,  \nVISWA-KARMAN forged this armour in the flames of heavenly fire,\n\nI shall be thy chariot driver and shall speed the thund\'ring car,  \nSlay the sin-polluted Ravan in this last and fatal war!"\n\nRama mounted on the chariot clad in arms of heavenly sheen,  \nAnd he mingled in a contest mortal eyes have never seen!\n\n## XI\n\n## RAVAN\'S THIRD BATTLE AND FALL\n\nGods and mortals watched the contest and the heroes of the war,  \nRavan speeding on his chariot, Rama on the heavenly car,\n\nAnd a fiercer form the warriors in their fiery frenzy wore,  \nAnd a deeper weight of hatred on their anguished bosoms bore,\n\nClouds of dread and deathful arrows hid the radiant face of sky,  \nDarker grew the day of combat, fiercer grew the contest high!\n\nPierced by Ravan\'s pointed weapons bleeding Rama owned no pain,  \nRama\'s arrows keen and piercing sought his foeman\'s life in vain,\n\nLong and dubious battle lasted, and with fury wilder fraught,  \nWounded, faint, and still unyielding, blind with wrath the rivals fought,\n\nPike and Club and mace and trident scaped from Ravan\'s vengeful hand,  \nSpear and arrows Rama wielded, and his bright and flaming brand!\n\nLong and dubious battle lasted, shook the ocean, hill and dale,  \nWinds were hushed in voiceless terror and the livid sun was pale,\n\nStill the dubious battle lasted, until Rama in his ire  \nWielded BRAHMA\'S deathful weapon flaming with celestial fire!\n\nWeapon which the Saint Agastya had unto the hero given,  \nWinged as lightning dart of INDRA, fatal as the bolt of heaven,\n\nWrapped in smoke and flaming flashes, speeding from the circled bow,  \nPierced the iron heart of Ravan, lain the lifeless hero low,\n\nAnd a cry of pain and terror from the Raksha ranks arose,  \nAnd a shout from joying Vanars as they smote their fleeing foes!\n\nHeavenly flowers in rain descended on the red and gory plain,  \nAnd from unseen harps and timbrels rose a soft celestial strain,\n\nAnd the ocean heaved in gladness, brighter shone the sunlit sky,  \nSoft and cool the gentle zephyrs through the forest murmured by,\n\nSweetest scent and fragrant odours wafted from celestial trees,  \nFell upon the earth and ocean, rode upon the laden breeze!\n\nVoice of blessing from the bright sky fell on Raghu\'s valiant son,--  \n"Champion of the true and righteous! now thy noble task is done!"\n\n## XII\n\n## MANDODARI\'S LAMENT AND THE FUNERALS\n\n"Hast thou fallen," wept in anguish Ravan\'s first and eldest bride,  \nMandodari, slender-waisted, Queen of Lanka\'s state and pride,\n\n"Hast thou fallen, king and consort, more than Gods in warlike might,  \nSlain by man, whom bright Immortals feared to facein dubious fight?\n\nNot a man!-the Dark Destroyer came to thee in mortal form,  \nOr the heaven-traversing VISHNU, INDRA ruler of the storm,\n\nGods of sky in shape of Vanars helped the dark and cruel deed,  \nGirdling round the Discus-Wielder in the battle\'s direst need!\n\nWell I knew,--when Khara, Dushan, were by Rama\'s prowess slain,  \nRama was no earthly mortal, he who crossed the mighty main,\n\nWell I knew,--when with his army he invested Lanka\'s gate,  \nRama was no earthly mortal but the messenger of Fate,\n\nAnd I prayed,--the faithful Sita, might unto her consort go,  \nFor \'tis writ that nations perish for a righteous woman\'s woe,\n\nBut for impious lust of woman,--all forgetful of thy wife,  \nThou hast lost thy crown and kingdom, thou hast lost thy fated life!\n\nWoe to me! the sad remembrance haunts my tortured bosom still,  \nOf our days on famed Kailasa or on Meru\'s golden hill,\n\nDone the days of joy and gladness, Mandodari\'s days are done,  \nSince her lord and king and husband from her dear embrace is gone!\n\nSorely wept the Queen of Lanka; Rama, tender, tearful, true,  \nBade the funeral rites and honours to a fallen foeman due,\n\nAnd they heaped the wood of Chandan and the fragrant garland laid,  \nOn the pyre they lifted Ravan in the richest robes arrayed,\n\nWeeping queens and sorrowing Rakshas round their fallen leader stood,  \nBrahmans with their chaunted mantras piled the dry and scented wood,\n\nOil and cords and sacred offerings were upon the altar laid,  \nAnd a goat of inky darkness as a sacrifice was slayed.\n\nPiously the good Bibhishan lighted Ravan\'s funeral pyre,  \nAnd the zephyrs gently blowing fanned the bright and blazing fire,\n\nSlow and sad with due abititions mourners left the funeral site,  \nRama then unstrung his weapon, laid aside his arms of might.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book XI: Rama\'s Return and Consecration](rama11.htm)\n\n'
