I, 6 b): 'For the work (I take) you, for pervasion\n(or accomplishment) you two!' For the sacrifice is a work: hence, in saying\n'for the work you two,' he says, 'for the sacrifice.' And 'for pervasion you\ntwo,' he says,\n\np. 12\n\nbecause he, as it were, pervades (goes through, accomplishes) the sacrifice.\n\n1:1:2:22\\. He then restrains his speech; for (restrained) speech means\nundisturbed sacrifice; so that (in so doing) he thinks: 'May I accomplish the\nsacrifice!' He now heats (the two objects on the Garhapatya), with the formula\n(Va _g_. S. I, 7 a): 'Scorched is the Rakshas, scorched are the enemies!' or\n(Va _g_. S. I, 7 b): 'Burnt out is the Rakshas, burnt out are the enemies!'\n\n1:1:2:33\\. For the gods, when they were performing the sacrifice, were afraid\nof a disturbance on the part of the Asuras and Rakshas: hence by this means he\nexpels from here, at the very opening 1 of the sacrifice, the evil spirits,\nthe Rakshas.\n\n1:1:2:44\\. He now steps forward (to the cart 2), with the text (Va _g_. S. I,\n7 c): 'I move along the wide aerial realm.' For the Rakshas roams about in the\nair, rootless and unfettered in both directions (below and above); and in\norder that this man (the Adhvaryu) may move about the air, rootless and\nunfettered in both directions, he by this very prayer renders the atmosphere\nfree from danger and evil spirits.\n\n1:1:2:55\\. It is from the cart that he should take (the rice required for the\nsacrifice). For at first the cart (is the receptacle of the rice) and\nafterwards this hall\n\np. 13\n\nand because he thinks 'what was at first (in the cart, and hence still\nunimpaired by entering the householder's abode), that I will operate upon;'\nfor that reason let him take (rice) from the cart.\n\n1:1:2:66\\. Moreover, the cart represents an abundance; for the cart does\nindeed represent an abundance: hence, when there is much of anything, people\nsay that there are 'cart-loads' of it. Thus he thereby approaches an\nabundance, and for this reason he should take from the cart.\n\n1:1:2:77\\. The cart further is (one of the means of) the sacrifice; for the\ncart is indeed (one of the means of) sacrifice. To the cart, therefore, refer\nthe (following) Ya _g_ us-texts, and not to a store-room, nor to a jar. The\n_Ri_ shis, it is true, once took (the rice) from a leathern bag, and hence, in\nthe case of the _Ri_ shis, the Ya _g_ us-texts applied to a leathern bag.\nHere, however, they are taken in their natural application. Because he thinks\n'from (or, by means of) the sacrifice I will perform the sacrifice,' let him,\ntherefore, take (rice) from the cart.\n\n1:1:2:88\\. Some do indeed take it from a (wooden) jar. In that case also he\nshould mutter the Ya _g_ us-texts without omitting any; and let him in that\ncase take (the rice) after inserting the wooden sword 1 under\n\np. 14\n\n[paragraph continues] (the jar). He does so, thinking 'where we want to yoke,\nthere we unyoke;' for from the same place where they yoke, they also unyoke.\n\n1:1:2:99\\. (Like) fire, verily, is the yoke of that very cart; for the yoke is\nindeed (like) fire: hence the shoulder of those (oxen) that draw this (cart)\nbecomes as if burnt by fire. The middle part of the pole behind the prop\nrepresents, as it were, its (the cart's) altar 1; and the enclosed space of\nthe cart (which contains the rice) constitutes its havirdhanam (receptacle of\nthe sacrificial food) 2.\n\n1:1:2:1010\\. He now touches the yoke, with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 8 a): 'Thou\nart the yoke (dhur); injure (dhurv) thou the injurer! injure him that injures\nus! injure him whom we injure!' For there being a fire in the yoke by which he\nwill have to pass when he fetches the material for the oblation, he thereby\npropitiates it, and thus that fire in the yoke does not injure him when he\npasses by.\n\n1:1:2:1111\\. Here now \xc3\x82ru _n_ i said: 'Every half-moon  3 I destroy the\nenemies.' This he said with reference to this point.\n\np. 15\n\n1:1:2:1212\\. Thereupon, whilst touching the pole behind the prop, he mutters\n(Va _g_. S. I, 8 b-9 a): 'To the gods thou belongest, thou the best carrying\none, the most firmly joined 1, the most richly filled 2, the most agreeable\n(to the gods), the best caller of the gods!' 'Thou art unbent, the receptacle\nof oblations; be thou firm, waver not!' Thus he eulogises the cart, hoping\nthat he may obtain the oblation from the one thus eulogised and pleased. He\nadds (Va _g_. S. I, 9 b), 'May thy Lord of Sacrifice not waver!' for Lord of\nSacrifice is the sacrificer, and it is for the sacrificer, therefore, that he\nthus prays for firmness.\n\n1:1:2:1313\\. He now ascends (the cart by the southern wheel), with the text\n(Va _g_. S. I, 9 c): 'May Vish _n_ u ascend thee!' For Vish _n_ u is the\nsacrifice; by striding (vi-kram) he obtained for the gods this all-pervading\npower (vikranti) which now belongs to them. By his first step he gained this\nvery (earth), by the second the aerial expanse, and by the last step the sky.\nAnd this very same pervading power Vish _n_ u, as sacrifice, by his strides\nobtains for him (the sacrificer).\n\n1:1:2:1414\\. He then looks (at the rice) and (addressing the cart) mutters (Va\n_g_. S. I, 9 d): 'Wide open (be\n\np. 16\n\nthou) to the wind!' For wind means breath; so that by this prayer he effects\nfree scope for the air of the (sacrificer's) breath.\n\n1:1:2:1515\\. With the text (Va _g_. S. I, 9 e), 'Repelled is the Rakshas!' he\nthen throws away whatever (grass, &c.) may have fallen on it. But if nothing\n(have fallen on it), let him merely touch it. He thereby drives away from it\nthe evil spirits, the Rakshas.\n\n1:1:2:1616\\. He touches (the rice), with the text (Va, . S. I, 9 f), 'Let the\nfive take!' for five are these fingers, and fivefold also is the sacrifice 1;\nso that he thereby puts the sacrifice on it (the cart).\n\n1:1:2:1717\\. He then takes (the rice), with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 10 a, b):\n'At the impulse (prasavana) of the divine Savit _ri_ , I take thee with the\narms of the A _s_ vins, with the hands of Pushan, thee, agreeable to Agni!'\nFor Savit _ri_ is the impeller (prasavit _ri_ ) of the gods: therefore he\ntakes this as one impelled by Savit _ri_. 'With the arms of the A _s_ vins,'\nhe says, because the two A _s_ vins are the Adhvaryu priests (of the gods).\n'With the hands of Pushan,' he says, because Pushan is distributer of portions\n(to the gods), who with his own hands places the food before them. The gods\nare the truth, and men are the untruth: thus he thereby takes (the rice) by\nmeans of the truth.\n\np. 17\n\n1:1:2:1818\\. He now announces (the oblation) to the deity (for whom it is\nintended). For when the Adhvaryu is about to take the oblation, all the gods\ndraw near to him, thinking, 'My name he will choose! my name he will choose!'\nand among them who are thus gathered together, he thereby 1 establishes\nconcord.\n\n1:1:2:1919\\. Another reason for which he announces (the oblation) to the\ndeity, is this: whichever deities are chosen, they consider it as an\nobligation that they are bound to fulfil whatever wish he entertains whilst\ntaking (the oblation); and for that reason also he announces it to the deity.\nAfter taking the oblations (to the other deities) in the same way as before\n2,--\n\n1:1:2:2020\\. He touches (the rice that is left), with the text (Va _g_. S. I,\n11 a): 'For existence (or, abundance,--I leave) thee, not for non-offering 3!'\nHe thereby causes it to increase again.\n\np. 18\n\n1:1:2:2121\\. He now (whilst seated on the cart) looks towards east, with the\ntext (Va _g_. S. I, 11 b): 'May I perceive the light!' For that cart being\ncovered up, its eye is thereby, as it were, affected with evil. Light,\nmoreover, represents the sacrifice, the day, the gods, and the sun; so that he\nthereby perceives this same (fourfold) light.\n\n1:1:2:2222\\. He then descends (from the cart), with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 11\nc): 'May those provided with doors stand firm on the earth!' Those provided\nwith doors are the houses: for the houses of the sacrificer might indeed be\ncapable of breaking down behind the back of his Adhvaryu, when he walks\nforward (from the cart) with the sacrifice, and might crush his (the\nsacrificer's) family. By this (text), however, he causes them to stand firmly\non this earth, so that they do not break down and crush (his family); for this\nreason he says: 'May those provided with doors stand firm on the earth!' He\nthen walks forward (north of the Garhapatya fire), with the text (Va _g_. S.\nI, 11 d), 'I move along the wide aerial realm;' the application of which is\nthe same (as before; see par. 4).\n\n1:1:2:2323\\. In the case of one (viz. householder) whose Garhapatya fire they\n(the priests) use for coking oblations, they place the utensils in the\nGarhapatya (house); and let him (the Adhvaryu) in that case put (the winnowing\nbasket with the rice) down at the back (or west) side of the Garhapatya. But\nin the case of one whose \xc3\x82havaniya they use for cooking oblations, they place\nthe utensils together in the \xc3\x82havaniya; and let him in that case put it (the\nrice) down at the back of the \xc3\x82havaniya. He should (in either case) do so,\nwith the text (Va _g_. S. I, 11 e), 'On the navel of the earth I place thee!'\nfor\n\np. 19\n\nthe navel means the centre, and the centre is safe from danger: for this\nreason he says, 'On the navel of the earth I place thee!' And further, 'In the\nlap of Aditi (the boundless or inviolable earth)!' for when people guard\nanything very carefully, they commonly say that 'they, as it were, carried it\nin their lap;' and this is the reason why he says, 'In the lap of Aditi!' And\nfurther, 'O Agni, do thou protect this offering!' whereby he makes this\noblation over for protection both to Agni and to this earth: for this reason\nhe says, 'O Agni, do thou protect this offering!'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[11:1](sbe1203.htm#fr_96) Or, 'and the sacrifice also is Vira _g_ ,' as the\nscholiast interprets the passage on the ground that at the performance of the\n_G_ yotish _t_ oma 190 stotriya verses are used, and that this number is\ndividable by ten, the number of syllables in the Vira _g_ metre; cf. Weber,\nInd. Streifen I, 36, note 4. See also X, 4, 3, 21, where the fire is\nidentified with the vira _g_ on the ground that there are ten fires, viz.\neight dhish _n_ ya fires and the \xc3\x82havaniya and Garhapatya. In VIII, 4, 5, 5\nvira _g_ is explained as 'that which rules.'\n\n[11:2](sbe1204.htm#fr_97) For the Agnihotra-hava _n_ i or ladle used for\nmaking the morning and evening milk-oblations, see note on I, 3, 1, 1. For the\nwinnowing basket ( _s_ urpa), see I, 1, 4, 19 seq.\n\n[12:1](sbe1204.htm#fr_98) Literally, 'from the very mouth,' which refers both\nto the mouth or hollow part of the two vessels (from which the enemies are, as\nit were, burnt out), and to the opening of the sacrifice. The same symbolical\nexplanation is met with on the occasion of the heating of the sacrificial\nspoon, I, 3, 1, 5.\n\n[12:2](sbe1204.htm#fr_99) The cart containing the rice or barley, or whatever\nmaterial may be used instead, stands behind (i.e. west of) the Garhapatya,\nfitted with all its appliances (except the oxen). Katy. _S_ r. II, 3, 12.\nRice-grains, as the most common material, will be assumed to constitute the\nchief havis (sacrificial food) at the present sacrifice.\n\n[13:1](sbe1204.htm#fr_100) The sphya is a straight sword (kha _d_ ga) or\nknife, a cubit long, carved out of khadira wood (Mimosa Catechu). Katy. _S_ r.\nI, 3, 33; 39. It is used for various purposes calculated to symbolically\ninsure the safe and undisturbed performance of the sacrifice. On the present\noccasion it represents the yoke, by touching which (par. 10) the cart is\nconnected with the sacrifice. At the close of the sacrifice also the offering\nspoons are, as it were, unyoked (or relieved of their duties), by being placed\non the yoke, if the rice was taken from the cart; or on the wooden sword lying\non the jar, if it was taken from the latter. See I, 8, 3, 26.\n\n[14:1](sbe1204.htm#fr_101) The pole of an Indian cart consists of two pieces\nof wood, joined together in its forepart and diverging towards the axle.\nHence, as Saya _n_ a remarks, it resembles the altar in shape, being narrower\nin front and broader at the back, the altar measuring twenty-four cubits in\nfront and thirty cubits at the back. At the extreme end of the pole a piece of\nwood is fastened on, or the pole itself is turned downwards, so as to serve as\na prop or rest (popularly called 'sipoy' in Western India, and 'horse' in\nEnglish).\n\n[14:2](sbe1204.htm#fr_102) The havirdhana (-ma _n_ _d_ apa) is a temporary\nshed or tent erected on the sacrificial ground for the performance of the\nSoma-sacrifice, in which the two carts containing the Soma-plants are placed.\nThese carts themselves, however, are also called havirdhana. Cf. IV, 6, 9, 10\nseq.; III, 5, 3, 7.\n\n[14:3](sbe1204.htm#fr_103) I.e. at the time of the new and the full moon.\nSchol.\n\n[15:1](sbe1204.htm#fr_104) Sasni-tama (? 'the most bountiful'); sasni is\nexplained by Mahidhara (in accordance with Yaska, Nir. V, 1) by sa _m_ snata,\nfrom sna, 'to purify, cleanse,' or from sna (snai), 'to envelop, wrap round;'\nhence 'cleanest or purest,' or 'most firmly secured by being tied (with\nthongs, &c.)' The latter was probably the meaning connected with the word in\nthis sacrificial formula; though the correct derivation is no doubt from san,\n'to acquire, gain,' and 'to bestow' (Roth, Nirukta notes, p. 52). In modern\nIndian carts the yoke is fastened on to the pole by a string.\n\n[15:2](sbe1204.htm#fr_105) Papritama, 'most filled with rice,' &c. Schol.\n\n[16:1](sbe1204.htm#fr_106) According to Saya _n_ a, because there are five\nkinds of oblations (havish-pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti) at the Soma-sacrifice. Cf. Ait. Br. II, 24,\nwith Haug's translation. Compare also the distinction of five different parts-\nin the victim at animal sacrifices: _S_ at. Br. I, 5, 2, 16; Ait. Br. II, 14;\nIII, 23; and the five kinds of victims, viz. man, horse, bullock, ram, and he-\ngoat: Ath. V. XI, 2, 9; _S_ at. Br. I, 2, 3, 6. 7; VI, 2, 1, 6. 18; VII, 5, 2,\nin; Taitt. S. IV, 2, 10; _Kh_ and. Up. II, 6, 1.\n\n[17:1](sbe1204.htm#fr_107) Viz. by calling out the names, since, without this\nbeing done, quarrels would arise among the deities as to whom the offering\nmight be intended for. Mahidh.\n\n[17:2](sbe1204.htm#fr_108) Viz. as in the case of the oblation to Agni, and\nsubstituting the name of the respective deity in the formula used above (par.\n17), 'Thee, agreeable to (Agni)!' The oblations prescribed for the full-moon\nsacrifice are a cake on eight potsherds for Agni, and one on eleven potsherds\nfor Agni and Soma: for each of these cakes he takes four handfuls from the\ncart [and throws them into the Agnihotra ladle lying on the winnowing basket\nwhich he holds with his left hand. With each of the first three handfuls of\neach of the two oblations he repeats the above text, whilst the fourth handful\nis thrown in silently. After the oblation for Agni is taken, he pours it from\nthe ladle into the winnowing basket so as to lie on the southern side; and\nthen takes out the oblation for Agni-Soma, which is afterwards poured into the\nbasket so as to lie north of the first heap]. Katy. _S_ r. II, 3, 20-21 and\nScholl.\n\n[17:3](sbe1204.htm#fr_109) Thus Mahidhara (i.e. to serve for future oblations,\nor as food for the priests'). Perhaps the meaning is, 'For a (divine or human)\nbeing thee, not for the evil spirit!' Cf. St. Petersburg Dict. s.v. bhuta.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 1, 3. Third Brahma _n_ a](sbe1205.htm)\n\n"
