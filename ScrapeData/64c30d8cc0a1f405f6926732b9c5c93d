But they declare, that the life of the mother of that person who eats at\nthis ceremony, his face turned in that direction, will be shortened. 2\n\n3\\. A vessel of brass, the centre of which is gilt, is best (for this\noccasion).\n\n4\\. And nobody else shall eat out of that vessel. 4\n\n5\\. He shall make a lump of as much (food) as he can swallow (at once). 5\n\n6\\. (And he shall) not scatter anything (on the ground).\n\n7\\. He shall not let go the vessel (with his left hand);\n\n8\\. Or he may let it go. 8\n\np. 150\n\n9\\. He shall swallow the whole mouthful at once, introducing it, together with\nthe thumb, (into the mouth.)\n\n10\\.

The ceremony which is here described, may\nalso be performed daily. If the reading prasya is adopted, the translation\nmust run thus: \'and he shall scatter (the remainder of the powder). If the\nwind,\' &c.\n\n[149:2](sbe0254.htm#fr_712) \'Therefore those whose mothers are alive should\nnot perform this ceremony.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[149:4](sbe0254.htm#fr_713) If the masculine bhoktavya _h_ is used instead of\nbhoktavyam, the participle must be construed with _k_ amasa _h_.\n\n[149:5](sbe0254.htm#fr_714) The verbum finitum, which according to the\nSanskrit text ought to be taken with the participle sa _m_ nayan, is grasita,\nSutra 9.\n\n[149:8](sbe0254.htm#fr_715) \'Why is this second alternative mentioned, as (the\nfirst Sutra) suffices? True. But according to the maxim that "restrictions are\nmade on account of the continuance of an action once begun," the meaning of\nthis second Sutra is that he shall p. 150 continue to the end to handle the\nvessel (in that manner in which) he has handled it when eating for the first\ntime.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[150:16](sbe0254.htm#fr_716) Haradatta remarks that some allow, according to\nII, 2, 4, 22, the sacred thread to be substituted, and others think that both\nthe thread and the garment should be worn over the left shoulder and under the\nright arm.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na II, Pa _t_ ala 8, Kha _n_ _d_ a 20](sbe0255.htm)\n\n'
