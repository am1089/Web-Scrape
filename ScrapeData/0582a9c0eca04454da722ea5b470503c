The Bara Rani\'s room must have\nbeen drawing me again. It had become an absolute necessity for me, that day,\nto feel that this life of mine had been able to strike some real, some\nresponsive chord in some other harp of life. One cannot realize one\'s own\nexistence by remaining within oneself--it has to be sought outside.\n\nAs I passed in front of my sister-in-law\'s room, she came out saying: "I was\nafraid you would be late again this afternoon. However. I ordered your dinner\nas soon as I heard you coming. It will be served in a minute."\n\n"Meanwhile," I said; "let me take out that money of yours and have it kept\nready to take with us."\n\nAs we walked on towards my room she asked me if the Police Inspector had made\nany report about the robbery. I somehow did not feel inclined to tell her all\nthe details of how that six thousand had come back. "That\'s just what all the\nfuss is about," I said evasively.\n\nWhen I went into my dressing-room and took out my bunch of keys, I did not\nfind the key of the iron safe on the ring. What an absurdly absent-minded\nfellow I was, to be sure! Only this morning I had been opening so many boxes\nand things, and never noticed that this key was not there.\n\n"What has happened to your key?" she asked me.\n\nI went on fumbling in this pocket and that, but could give her no answer. I\nhunted in the same place over and over again. It dawned on both of us that it\ncould not be a case of the key being mislaid. Someone must have taken it off\nthe ring. Who could it be? Who else could have come into this room?\n\n"Don\'t you worry about it," she said to me. "Get through your dinner first.\nThe Chota Rani must have kept it herself, seeing how absent-minded you are\ngetting."\n\nI was, however, greatly disturbed. It was never Bimal\'s habit to take any key\nof mine without telling me about it. Bimal was not present at my meal-time\nthat day: she was busy feasting Amulya in her own room. My sister-in-law\nwanted to send for her, but I asked her not to do so.\n\nI had just finished my dinner when Bimal came in. I would have preferred not\nto discuss the matter of the key in the Bara Rani\'s presence, but as soon as\nshe saw Bimal, she asked her: "Do you know, dear, where the key of the safe\nis?"\n\n"I have it," was the reply.\n\n"Didn\'t I say so!" exclaimed my sister-in-law triumphantly. "Our Chota Rani\npretends not to care about these robberies, but she takes precautions on the\nsly, all the same."\n\nThe look on Bimal\'s face made my mind misgive me. "Let the key be, now," I\nsaid. "I will take out that money in the evening."\n\n"There you go again, putting it off," said the Bara Rani. "Why not take it out\nand send it to the treasury while you have it in mind?"\n\n"I have taken it out already," said Bimal.\n\nI was startled.\n\n"Where have you kept it, then?" asked my sister-in-law.\n\n"I have spent it."\n\n"Just listen to her! Whatever did you spend all that money on?"\n\nBimal made no reply. I asked her nothing further. The Bara Rani seemed about\nto make some further remark to Bimala, but checked herself. "Well, that is all\nright, anyway," she said at length, as she looked towards me. "Just what I\nused to do with my husband\'s loose cash. I knew it was no use leaving it with\nhim-- his hundred and one hangers-on would be sure to get hold of it. You are\nmuch the same, dear! What a number of ways you men know of getting through\nmoney. We can only save it from you by stealing it ourselves! Come along now.\nOff with you to bed."\n\nThe Bara Rani led me to my room, but I hardly knew where I was going. She sat\nby my bed after I was stretched on it, and smiled at Bimal as she said: "Give\nme one of your pans, Chotie darling-- what? You have none! You have become a\nregular mem-sahib. Then send for some from my room."\n\n"But have you had your dinner yet?" I anxiously enquired.\n\n"Oh long ago," she replied--clearly a fib.\n\nShe kept on chattering away there at my bedside, on all manner of things. The\nmaid came and told Bimal that her dinner had been served and was getting cold,\nbut she gave no sign of having heard it. "Not had your dinner yet? What\nnonsense! It\'s fearfully late." With this the Bara Rani took Bimal away with\nher.\n\nI could divine that there was some connection between the taking out of this\nsix thousand and the robbing of the other. But I have no curiosity to learn\nthe nature of it. I shall never ask.\n\nProvidence leaves our life moulded in the rough--its object being that we\nourselves should put the finishing touches, shaping it into its final form to\nour taste. There has always been the hankering within me to express some great\nidea in the process of giving shape to my life on the lines suggested by the\nCreator. In this endeavour I have spent all my days. How severely I have\ncurbed my desires, repressed myself at every step, only the Searcher of the\nHeart knows.\n\nBut the difficulty is, that one\'s life is not solely one\'s own. He who would\ncreate it must do so with the help of his surroundings, or he will fail. So it\nwas my constant dream to draw Bimal to join me in this work of creating\nmyself. I loved her with all my soul; on the strength of that, I could not but\nsucceed in winning her to my purpose--that was my firm belief.\n\nThen I discovered that those who could simply and naturally draw their\nenvironment into the process of their self-creation belonged to one species of\nthe genus "man",--and I to another. I had received the vital spark, but could\nnot impart it. Those to whom I have surrendered my all have taken my all, but\nnot myself with it.\n\nMy trial is hard indeed. Just when I want a helpmate most, I am thrown back on\nmyself alone. Nevertheless, I record my vow that even in this trial I shall\nwin through. Alone, then, shall I tread my thorny path to the end of this\nlife\'s journey ...\n\nI have begun to suspect that there has all along been a vein of tyranny in me.\nThere was a despotism in my desire to mould my relations with Bimala in a\nhard, clear-cut, perfect form. But man\'s life was not meant to be cast in a\nmould. And if we try to shape the good, as so much mere material, it takes a\nterrible revenge by losing its life.\n\nI did not realize all this while that it must have been this unconscious\ntyranny of mine which made us gradually drift apart. Bimala\'s life, not\nfinding its true level by reason of my pressure from above, has had to find an\noutlet by undermining its banks at the bottom. She has had to steal this six\nthousand rupees because she could not be open with me, because she felt that,\nin certain things, I despotically differed from her.\n\nMen, such as I, possessed with one idea, are indeed at one with those who can\nmanage to agree with us; but those who do not, can only get on with us by\ncheating us. It is our unyielding obstinacy, which drives even the simplest to\ntortuous ways. In trying to manufacture a helpmate, we spoil a wife.\n\nCould I not go back to the beginning? Then, indeed, I should follow the path\nof the simple. I should not try to fetter my life\'s companion with my ideas,\nbut play the joyous pipes of my love and say: "Do you love me? Then may you\ngrow true to yourself in the light of your love. Let my suggestions be\nsuppressed, let God\'s design, which is in you, triumph, and my ideas retire\nabashed."\n\nBut can even Nature\'s nursing heal the open wound, into which our accumulated\ndifferences have broken out? The covering veil, beneath the privacy of which\nNature\'s silent forces alone can work, has been torn asunder. Wounds must be\nbandaged--can we not bandage our wound with our love, so that the day may come\nwhen its scar will no longer be visible? It is not too late? So much time has\nbeen lost in misunderstanding; it has taken right up to now to come to an\nunderstanding; how much more time will it take for the correcting? What if the\nwound does eventually heal?--can the devastation it has wrought ever be made\ngood?\n\nThere was a slight sound near the door. As I turned over I saw Bimala\'s\nretreating figure through the open doorway. She must have been waiting by the\ndoor, hesitating whether to come in or not, and at last have decided to go\nback. I jumped up and bounded to the door, calling: "Bimal." She stopped on\nher way. She had her back to me. I went and took her by the hand and led her\ninto our room. She threw herself face downwards on a pillow, and sobbed and\nsobbed. I said nothing, but held her hand as I sat by her head.\n\nWhen her storm of grief had abated she sat up. I tried to draw her to my\nbreast, but she pushed my arms away and knelt at my feet, touching them\nrepeatedly with her head, in obeisance. I hastily drew my feet back, but she\nclasped them in her arms, saying in a choking voice: "No, no, no, you must not\ntake away your feet. Let me do my worship."\n\nI kept still. Who was I to stop her? Was I the god of her worship that I\nshould have any qualms?\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XXIII](hw48.htm)\n\n'
