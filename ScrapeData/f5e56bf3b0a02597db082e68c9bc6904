Now if a man feels his conscience charged with (evil) actions committed by\nhimself, let him boil for himself (alone), when the stars have risen, a\nhandful of barley, (and prepare) gruel (with that). 1\n\n2\\. Let him not perform the Vai _s_ vadeva oblation with (a portion of) that,\n\n3\\. Nor (shall) a Bali offering (be performed) on that (occasion).\n\n4\\. Let him consecrate the barley before it is boiled, while it is being\nboiled, and after it has been boiled, with the (following) Mantras\n\n5\\. 'Thou art barley, thou art the king of grains, thou art sacred to Varu _n_\na and mixed with honey, the sages have proclaimed thee an expeller of all\nguilt and a means of purification.' 5\n\np. 298\n\n'Ye barley-grains are clarified butter and honey, ye barley-grains are water\nand ambrosia. May you remove my guilt and all my sins:'\n\n'Those committed by words, by acts, and by evil thoughts; ill-fortune and the\nnight of all-destroying time,--all that avert from me, ye barley-grains.'\n\n'(From the sin of eating) food which had been worried by dogs or pigs, or\nwhich had been defiled by crows and impure men, from the sin of disobedience\ntowards mother and father,--from all that purify me, ye barley-grains.'\n\n'From the dreadful (guilt of) mortal sins and of the crime (of serving) a\nking, from the wrong done to infants or aged men, from (the guilt) of stealing\ngold, of breaking my vows, of sacrificing for an un-worthy man, of speaking\nevil of Brahma _n_ as,--from all that purify me, ye barley-grains.'\n\n'From (the sin of eating) the food of many men, of harlots and of _S_ udras,\nof (partaking of) funeral dinners and of (the food given by) persons who are\nunclean on account of a death or a birth, of that given by thieves, or at a\nfuneral sacrifice offered to one who lately died,--from all that purify me, ye\nbarley-grains.'\n\n6\\. (While the barley) is being boiled, he must protect it (and recite the\ntext), 'Adoration to Rudra, the lord of created beings; pacified is the sky;'\nthe Anuvaka (beginning), 'Give strength;' the five sentences (beginning), 'The\ngods who are seated in front, led by Agni;' the two (texts), 'Do not hurt 6\n\np. 299\n\nour offspring,' (and) 'The Brahman-priest among the gods.'\n\n7\\. Having purified himself (by sipping water, &c.), he shall eat a little of\nthe boiled (mess), after pouring it into (another) vessel.\n\n8\\. Let him offer it as a sacrifice to the soul, (reciting the text), 'May the\ngods, who are born from the internal organ and joined to the internal organ,\nwho are very strong, whose father is Daksha, protect us (and) guard us;\nadoration to them, to them Svaha.' 8\n\n9\\. Let him who desires intelligence (subsist on such food during three (days\nand) nights.\n\n10\\. A sinner who drinks it during six (days and) nights becomes pure.\n\n11\\. He who drinks it during seven (days and) nights is purified from (the\nguilt of) the murder of a learned Brahma _n_ a, of violating a Guru's bed, of\nstealing gold, and of drinking Sura.\n\n12\\. He who drinks it during eleven (days and) nights, removes even the sins\ncommitted by his ancestors.\n\n13\\. 'But he who during twenty-one days (drinks gruel made) of barley-grains\nwhich have passed through a cow, sees the _G_ a _n_ as and the lord of the _G_\na _n_ as, sees the goddess of learning and the lord of learning.' Thus speaks\nthe venerable Baudhayana.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[297:1](sbe1478.htm#fr_1360) **6**. For the whole Adhyaya compare Vish _n_ u\nXLVIII.\n\n[297:5](sbe1478.htm#fr_1361) According to Govinda, Vamadeva is the _Ri_ shi of\nthese Mantras. The phrase, 'Thou art sacred to Varu _n_ a,' is to be\nexplained, according to Govinda, by the fact that offerings presented to Varu\n_n_ a frequently consist of barley. 'Honey' means, according to some, 'sweet\nbutter,' with which the dish is seasoned.\n\n[298:6](sbe1478.htm#fr_1362) The Anuvaka meant is Taitt. Sa _m_ hita I, 2, 14.\nThe five sentences are found, ibid. I, 8, 7, 1. Regarding the text ma nastoke,\n'do not hurt our offspring,' see above, III, 2, 9. The last p. 299 Mantra\noccurs Taitt. Sa _m_ hita III, 4, II, I. Govinda says that material\nprotection, too, in the shape of an iron platter or cover is to be given to\nthe boiling barley.\n\n[299:8](sbe1478.htm#fr_1363) The text occurs Taitt. Sa _m_ hita I, 2, 3, I. It\nconsists of five sentences, and is addressed to the five vital airs, to each\nof which the eater offers one oblation.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na III, Adhyaya 7](sbe1479.htm)\n\n"
