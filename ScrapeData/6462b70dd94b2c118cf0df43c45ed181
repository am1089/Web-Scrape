Now on the day of full moon in the month Vai _s_ akha he must spread out\nupon a woollen blanket the skin of a black antelope (together with the horns\nand hoofs), after having adorned the former with gold and the latter with\nsilver, and after having ornamented the tail with a string of pearls.\n\n2\\. After that, he must cover (that part of the blanket which is not covered\nby the skin) with sesamum.\n\n3\\. And he must adorn the navel with gold.\n\n4\\. He must cover (the skin) with a couple of new garments.\n\n5\\. He must place all sorts of perfumes and jewels upon it.\n\n[LXXXVII. 1, The particle atha, 'now,' indicates the beginning of a new\nsection, treating of gifts. It comprises Chapters LXXXVII-XCIII. (Nand.) The\ncommentator infers from a corresponding passage of the Matsya-pura _n_ a, that\nthe following further rules are implied in this Sutra. The ceremony may also\ntake place on the full moon days in the months Magha, Karttika, and \xc3\x82shadha,\non the twelfth day after the summer solstice, and during an eclipse of the sun\nor moon. The silver on the hoofs must weigh five Palas, And the gold on the\nhorns ten Suvarnas (or two Palas and a half). The place must be pure, smeared\nwith cow-dung, and covered with Ku _s_ a grass.\n\n3\\. 'The Skanda-pura _n_ a states that the eyes must be adorned with jewels.'\n(Nand.)\n\n5\\.

After having placed on its four sides (beginning with the eastern side)\nfour metallic dishes (of copper, silver, white copper, and gold respectively)\nfilled with milk, sour milk, honey, and clarified butter respectively, (and\nhaving poured out water) he must give (the skin, seizing it by the tail), to a\nBrahma _n_ a, who is an Agnihotrin[1], decked with ornaments, and clad in two\ngarments.\n\n7\\. There are (the following) stanzas in regard to this subject:\n\n8\\. 'He who bestows (upon a pious Brahma _n_ a) the skin of a black antelope,\ntogether with the hoofs and horns, after having covered it with seeds of\nsesamum and garments, and adorned it with all sorts of jewels:\n\n9\\. 'That man doubtless obtains the same reward as if he were to bestow the\nwhole earth on him, bordered as it is on every side (by the oceans), together\nwith the oceans and caverns, and with rocks, groves, and forests.\n\n10\\. 'He who places sesamum, gold, honey, and butter on the skin of a black\nantelope and gives the whole to a Brahmana, annihilates the consequences of\nall his own evil actions.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: LXXXVIII.](sbe07090.htm)\n\n"
