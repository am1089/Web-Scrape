I must endure  \nThe mighty grief that mocks at cure.'  \n   Thus, all his thoughts on Sita bent,  \nTo Janasthan the chieftain went,  \nHastening on with eager stride,  \nAnd Lakshman hurried by his side.  \nWith toil and thirst and hunger worn,  \nHis breast with doubt and anguish torn,  \n   He sought the well-known spot.  \nAgain, again he turned to chide  \nWith quivering lips which terror dried:  \n   He looked, and found her not.  \nWithin his leafy home he sped,  \nEach pleasant spot he visited  \n   Where oft his darling strayed.  \n'Tis as I feared', he cried, and there,  \nYielding to pangs too great to bear,  \n   He sank by grief dismayed.  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LX.: Lakshman Reproved.](ry258.htm)\n\n"
