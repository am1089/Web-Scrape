Next comes Kau _n_ _th_ aravya:\n\n2\\. There are 360 syllables (vowels), 360 sibilants (consonants), 360, groups.\n\n3\\. What we called syllables are the days, what we called sibilants are the\nnights, what we called groups are the junctions of days and nights. So far\nwith regard to the gods (the days).\n\n4\\. Now with regard to the body. The syllables which we explained\nmythologically, are physiologically the bones; the sibilants which we\nexplained mythologically, are physiologically the marrow.\n\n5\\. Marrow is the real breath (life), for marrow is seed, and without breath\n(life) seed is not sown. Or when it is sown without breath (life), it will\ndecay, it will not grow.\n\n6\\. The groups which we explained mythologically, are physiologically the\njoints.\n\n7\\. Of that triad, viz. bones, marrow, and joints, there are 540 (parts) on\nthis side (the right), and 540 on that side (the left). They make 1080\ntogether, and 1080 are the rays of the sun. They make the B _ri_ hati verses\nand the day (of the Mahavrata) 1.\n\n8\\. Thus that self which consists of sight, hearing, metre, mind, and speech\nis like unto the syllables.\n\n9\\. He who knows this self which consists of sight, hearing, metre, mind, and\nspeech, as like unto syllables, obtains union, likeness, or nearness with the\nsyllables, has sons and cattle, and lives his full age.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[258:1](sbe01234.htm#fr_660) There are in the Mahavrata eighty tristichs of B\n_ri_ hatis, and as each B _ri_ hati is decreed to consist of thirty-six\nsyllables, ten would give 360 syllables, and three times ten, 1080.
