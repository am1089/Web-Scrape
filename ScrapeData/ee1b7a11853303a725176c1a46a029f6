When he is sixteen years old, the Ke _s_ anta (i.e. the shaving of his\nbeard, is to be done),\n\n4\\. Or, according as it is considered auspicious by all (the different\nfamilies).\n\n5\\. After food has been distributed to the Brahma _n_ as, the mother takes the\nboy, bathes him, puts on him an under and an upper garment which have not yet\nbeen washed, and putting him on her lap, she sits down to the west of the\nfire.\n\n6\\. The father taking hold (of his wife) sacrifices \xc3\x82 _g_ ya oblations, and\nafter he has partaken of the (sacrificial) food, he pours warm water into cold\nwater with (the words), 'With warm water come hither, Vayu! Aditi, cut the\nhair.'\n\n7\\. At the Ke _s_ anta ceremony (Sutra 3), 'hair and beard' (instead of\n'hair').\n\n8\\. He throws a piece of fresh butter, or of ghee, or some curds into it (i.e.\ninto the water, Sara 6).\n\n9 9. Taking some (water) he moistens the hair near the right ear with (the\nformula), 'On the impulse of Savit _ri_ may the divine waters moisten\n\np. 302\n\nthy body in order that long life and splendour may be thine.'\n\n10 10.

Taking up a copper razor with (the formula), 'Friendly by name' (Va\n_g_. Sa _m_ h.

Cutting off (the Ku _s_ a shoots) together with the hair, he throws them\non a lump of bull's dung which they keep northwards of the fire.\n\n13\\. In the same way two other times silently.\n\n14\\. The moistening and the other rites are repeated with the two other (tufts\nof hair).\n\n15\\. Behind with (the verse), 'The threefold age' (Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. III, 62).\n\n16 16.

Three times he shaves round the head, from left to right;\n\n18\\. Including the face, at the Ke _s_ anta ceremony.\n\n19 19. (He recites the verse,) 'When the shaver shaves his hair with the\nrazor, the wounding, the well-shaped, purify his head, but do not take away\nhis life.'\n\n20 20. He adds (the word), 'his face' at the Ke _s_ anta ceremony.\n\n21\\. With that water (Sutras 6, 8) he moistens his head, and gives the razor\nto the barber with (the words), 'Without wounding him, shave him.'\n\n22\\. The locks of hair which are left over, are to be arranged as it is\nconsidered auspicious (in his family).\n\n23 23. Having put away that lump of dung with the hair so that it is hidden in\na cow-stable, or in a small pond, or in the vicinity of water; he gives an\noptional gift to the teacher;\n\n24\\. A cow at the Ke _s_ anta ceremony.\n\n25\\.
