And in the case of space also, on account of there being no difference.\n\nIn order to prove the permanency of external and internal things, we have\ndisproved the view that the two forms of destruction called pratisa _n_ khya\nand apratisa _n_ khya mean reduction of an existing thing to nothing. This\ngives us an opportunity to disprove the view of Ether(space) being likewise a\nmere irrational non-entity, as the Bauddhas hold it to be. Ether cannot be\nheld to be a mere irrational non-entity, because, like those things which are\nadmitted to be positive existences, i.e. earth, and so on, it is proved by\nconsciousness not invalidated by any means of proof. For the formation of\nimmediate judgments such as 'here a hawk flies, and there a vulture,' implies\nour being conscious of ether as marking the different places of the flight of\nthe different birds. Nor is it possible to hold that Space is nothing else but\nthe non-existence (abhava) of earth, and so on; for this view collapses as\nsoon as set\n\np. 507\n\nforth in definite alternatives. For whether we define Space as the antecedent\nand subsequent non-existence of earth, and so on, or as their mutual non-\nexistence, or as their absolute non-existence--on none of these alternatives\nwe attain the proper idea of Space. If, in the first place, we define it as\nthe antecedent and subsequent non-existence of earth, and so on, it will\nfollow that, as the idea of Space can thus not be connected with earth and\nother things existing at the present moment, the whole world is without Space.\n\nIf, in the second place, we define it as the mutual non-existence of earth,\nand so on, it will follow that, as such mutual non-existence inheres in the\nthings only which stand towards each other in the relation of mutual non-\nexistence, there is no perception of Space in the intervals between those\nthings(while as a matter of fact there is). And, in the third place, absolute\nnon-existence of earth, and so on, cannot of course be admitted. And as non-\nexistence (abhava) is clearly conceived as a special state of something\nactually existing, Space even if admitted to be of the nature of abhava, would\nnot on that account be a futile non-entity (something 'tu _kkh_ a' or\n'nirupakhya').\n\n24\\. And on account of recognition.\n\nWe return to the proof of the, previously mooted, permanence of things. The\n'anusm _ri_ ti' of the Sutra means cognition of what was previously perceived,\ni.e. recognition. It is a fact that all things which were perceived in the\npast may be recognised, such recognition expressing itself in the form 'this\nis just that (I knew before).' Nor must you say that this is a mere erroneous\nassumption of oneness due to the fact of the thing now perceived being similar\nto the thing perceived before, as in the case of the flame (where a succession\nof flames continually produced anew is mistaken for one continuous flame); for\nyou do not admit that there is one permanent knowing subject that could have\nthat erroneous idea. What one person has perceived, another cannot judge to be\nthe same as, or similar to, what he is perceiving himself. If therefore you\nhold that there is an erroneous\n\np. 508\n\nidea of oneness due to the perception of similarity residing in different\nthings perceived at different times, you necessarily must acknowledge oneness\non the part of the cognising subject. In the case of the flame there is a\nvalid means of knowledge to prove that there really is a succession of similar\nflames, but in the case of the jar, we are not aware of such a means, and we\ntherefore have no right to assume that recognition is due to the similarity of\nmany successive jars.---Perhaps you will here argue as follows. The\nmomentariness of jars and the like is proved by Perception as well as\nInference. Perception in the first place presents as its object the present\nthing which is different from non-present things, in the same way as it\npresents the blue thing as different from the yellow; it is in this way that\nwe know the difference of the present thing from the past and the future.\nInference again proceeds as follows--jars and the like are momentary because\nthey produce effects and have existence (sattva); what is non-momentary, such\nas the horn of a hare, does not produce effects and does not possess\nexistence. We therefore conclude from the existence of the last momentary jar\nthat the preceding jar-existences also are perishable, just because they are\nmomentary existences like the existence of the last jar.--But both this\nperception and this inference have already been disproved by what was said\nabove about the impossibility of momentary existences standing to one another\nin the relation of cause and effect. Moreover, that difference of the present\nobject from the non-present object which is intimated by Perception does not\nprove the present object to be a different _thing_ (from the past object of\nPerception),but merely its being connected with the present time. This does\nnot prove it to be a different thing, for the same thing can be connected with\ndifferent times. The two reasons again which were said to prove the\nmomentariness of jars are invalid because they may be made to prove just the\ncontrary of what they are alleged to prove. For we may argue as follows--From\nexistence and from their having effects it follows that jars, and so on, are\npermanent; for whatever is non-permanent, is non-existent, and does\n\np. 509\n\nnot produce effects, as e.g. the horn of a hare. The capacity of producing\neffects can in fact be used only to prove non-momentariness on the part of\njars, and so on; for as things perishing within a moment are not capable of\nacting, they are not capable of producing effects. Further, as it is seen in\nthe case of the last momentary existence that its destruction is due to a\nvisible cause (viz. the blow of a hammer or the like), the proper conclusion\nis that also the other momentary jars (preceding the last one) require visible\ncauses for their destruction; and(as no such causes are seen, it follows\nthat)the jar is permanent and continuous up to the time when a destructive\ncause, such as the blow of a hammer, supervenes. Nor can it be said that\nhammers and the like are not the causes of destruction, but only the causes of\nthe origination of a new series of momentary existences dissimilar to the\nformer ones--in the case of the jar, e.g. of a series of momentary fragments\nof a jar; for we have proved before that the destruction of jars, and so on,\nmeans nothing but their passing over into a different condition, e.g. that of\nfragments. And even if destruction were held to be something different from\nthe origination of fragments, it would yet be reasonable to infer, on the\nground of immediate succession in time, that the cause of the destruction is\nthe blow of the hammer.\n\nHence it is impossible to deny in any way the permanency of things as proved\nby the fact of recognition. He who maintains that recognition which has for\nits object the oneness of a thing connected with successive points of time has\nfor its objects different things, might as well say that several cognitions\nof, let us say, blue colour have for their object something different from\nblue colour. Moreover, for him who maintains the momentariness of the\ncognising subject and of the objects of cognition, it would be difficult\nindeed to admit the fact of Inference which presupposes the ascertainment and\nremembrance of general propositions. He would in fact not be able to set forth\nthe reason required to prove his assertion that things are momentary; for the\nspeaker perishes in the very moment when he states the proposition to be\nproved, and another person is unable to\n\np. 510\n\ncomplete what has been begun by another and about which he himself does not\nknow anything.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 25.
