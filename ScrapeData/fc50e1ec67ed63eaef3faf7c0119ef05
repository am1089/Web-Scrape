Luchmee in the hope of your protection, has corn and\ntaken up her fixed abode. We, cowherdesses, are your slaves; show compassion,\nand quickly take thought of us; since we have seen your elegant, dark-\ncoloured, beautiful form, we have become your slaves without purchase. The\narrows of your eyes have pierced our breasts. Beloved! in what way and manner\nare we not yours? Have mercy on us, as our lives are ebbing out. Lay aside\nrelentlessness, and be pleased to present yourself soon to our sight. If your\nwish was to destroy us, why did you save us from the poisonous serpent, from\nfire and from inundation; why not have allowed us then to die? You are not\nmerely Jusodha\'s son. Bruhmu, Roodru, Indru and all the gods, humbling\nthemselves before you, have brought you on the earth for the protection of the\nworld.\n\n"O lord of life! it is a subject of great wonder to us, whom you will\npreserve, if you destroy your own! Beloved! your are acquainted with the\nsecrets of the heart; why do you not put\n\np. 109\n\nan end to our affliction, and grant the accomplishment of our hopes! What,\nbeloved! do you wish to display your heroism towards us weak women? What pain\ndo we not suffer, when we behold your gentle smile, your affectionate glance,\nthe bend of your eye-brows, the coquetry of your eyes, the undulating motion\nof your neck, and the splendour of your discourse? And when you used to go to\nthe jungle to give pasture to the cows, the stones and thorns of the forest\ngave pain to our minds when we thought of your soft feet. You went early in\nthe morning, and returned in the evening: but still these four puhurs appeared\nto us like four ages. When sitting in your presence, we gazed on your elegant\nform, we thought in our minds, that Bruhmu was very foolish in having formed\nthe eye-lid, to prevent our fixed and uninterrupted gaze."\n\nHaving told so much of the story, Shree Shookdeo Jee said, O great king! the\ncowherdesses, distressed at their separation from Krishnu, continued in this\ndisconsolate manner to sing his exploits, and were worn out by their exertions\nin doing so; but still Beharee did not come.\n\nAt length, being utterly without hope, and giving up all expectation of\nliving, they became quite senseless from total want of resolution; and falling\ndown, wept so violently and with such lamentations, that all things, animate\nand inanimate, on hearing them, were very much afflicted.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXXIII](psa34.htm)\n\n'
