Some place\nthe R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana as early as B.C. 500, whilst others affirm that it could not have\nbeen composed before B.C. 100, and that a considerable portion was added much\nlater. The Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata is supposed to be fully a century nearer our own time.\nUnlike the Vedas, they, as well as the Pur\xc4\x81nas and Tantras, may be read by\nother than Br\xc4\x81hmans. Each of these books is of immense bulk, and the same\nstories frequently reappear in them. Yet to this day they retain a firm hold\nof the faith and veneration of the mass of the people of India. Nor is this to\nbe wondered at when we read such words as these, often repeated in these\nworks: "He who reads\n\np. 90\n\nand repeats this holy life-giving R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana [or the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata], is liberated\nfrom all sins, and exalted with all his posterity to the highest heaven."\n\nIt is almost equally difficult to determine the date of the Pur\xc4\x81nas. It is,\nhowever, believed that none of them are older than the 8th century A.D.,\nthough some of the legends incorporated in them may have come from much\nearlier times. That they are considerably later than the two great Epics is\nevident from the fact that many, who are described there as men and heroes\nonly, in the Pur\xc4\x81nas, are said to be divine beings. These books differ from\nthe Vedas in this respect, that whilst the older scriptures treat of the\nreligion common to the Hindus of that period, all of whom worshipped the same\ndeities, each Pur\xc4\x81na is chiefly concerned with some one god whose excellences\nare extolled, whilst others are spoken of in a depreciatory manner. There is a\ngeneral respect shown to the rest of the gods of the Pantheon; yet the\nparticular deity to whose praise the Pur\xc4\x81na is devoted, is declared to be\nsupreme; and of him the others are said to be incarnations. Now Brahm\xc4\x81, now\nSiva, now Vishnu in some of his many forms, is the great god, whose will is\nthat all men should worship him. It may be that originally the Pur\xc4\x81nas were\nwritten in praise of the three great gods, but as the Hindu conquest extended\nover the continent, there being no central religious authority, a spirit of\nsectarianism arose and the writers extolled their own special deity at the\nexpense of the others.\n\nThe Pur\xc4\x81nas may be classified as follows:--\n\nI. Those which are devoted to the praise of Brahm\xc4\x81; viz. the Brahm\xc4\x81; the\nBr\xc4\x81hmanda, the Brahm\xc4\x81vaivarta, the M\xc4\x81rkandeya, the Bhavishya, and the Vaman.\n\nII. Those which relate to Vishnu; viz. the Vishnu,\n\np. 91\n\nthe Bh\xc4\x81gavata, the Naradiya, the Garuda, the Padma, and the V\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ha.\n\nIII. Those which are chiefly connected with Siva; viz. the Siva, the Linga,\nthe Skanda, the Agni, the Matsya, the Karma. For the Agni Pur\xc4\x81na another\ncalled the V\xc4\x81yu is sometimes substituted.\n\nThese Pur\xc4\x81nas are the authority for nearly the whole of the popular Hinduism\nof the present day. They are largely read by the people. Parts of some and the\nwhole of others have been translated into the vernaculars from the Sanskrit;\nand where the people cannot read, it is a common practice for their Guru or\nteacher to read a portion to them at his periodic visits. By this means the\ncontents of these books are widely known.\n\nThe fact that each Pur\xc4\x81na is devoted to the praise of some special deity, who,\naccording to its teaching, is supreme, whilst other deities, described in\nother Pur\xc4\x81nas in equally extravagant language, are slighted, and in some cases\ntheir worship forbidden, seems to prove that these books must have been\nwritten at different times and in different places, and probably by those who\nwere ignorant of what others had written. And yet the popular belief is that\nthey were all the work of the great sage Vy\xc4\x81sa, the arranger of the Vedas and\nthe Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata.\n\nThe ideal Pur\xc4\x81na--and the Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na approaches more nearly to this ideal\nthan any other--should treat of * five chief topics:--"I. The creation of the\nuniverse; II. Its destruction and re-creation; III. The genealogy of gods and\npatriarchs; IV. The reigns and periods of the Manus (rulers over long periods\nof time); and V. The history of the two great races of kings, the Solar and\nthe Lunar." The Pur\xc4\x81nas, as at present known,\n\np. 92\n\nomit some of these great questions and introduce others. Great discrepancies,\ntoo, are found in the different genealogies. *\n\nThe last class of religious books to be mentioned here are the Tantras. The\nword signifies "a means of faith," and they teach that faith in the\nrevelations they record will save from the greatest sin. They are in the form\nof a dialogue between Siva and his wife. In answer to her questions, the god\ngives manifold instructions concerning worship. The date of these works is\ninvolved in great obscurity; but as far as can be known they probably are not\nearlier than the 6th century of our era. They form the authority for the faith\nand ceremonies of the Saktas, as the worshippers of the wife of Siva are\ncalled, and are by them regarded as a fifth Veda. The doctrines, or at least a\npart of the doctrines, of these sects is kept secret and communicated to those\nonly who receive solemn initiation into the mysteries.\n\nIn describing the Pur\xc4\x81nic deities, I shall follow the common order. The Hindus\nspeak of three great gods--Brahm\xc4\x81, Vishnu, Siva, who form what is often spoken\nof as the Hindu Triad. After giving an account of each of these and their\nconsorts, I shall describe those who are regarded as their incarnations, or\ndescendants; and then proceed to speak of others who have no formal connection\nwith any of them. It will be seen that most of the principal deities are\nconnected with one or other of these three.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[91:*](hmvp15.htm#fr_89) Wilson\'s Preface to the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na."\n\n[92:*](hmvp15.htm#fr_90) For an outline of the contents of the different\nPur\xc4\x81nas, see Introduction to Wilson\'s "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter II.
