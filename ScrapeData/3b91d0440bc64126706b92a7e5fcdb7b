Prayer at the election of a king.\n\n1\\. (Thy) kingdom hath come to thee: arise, endowed with lustre! Go forth as\nthe lord of the people, rule (shine) thou, a universal ruler! All the regions\nof the compass shall call thee, O king; attended and revered be thou here!  \n2\\. Thee the clans, thee these regions, goddesses five, shall choose for\nempire! Root thyself upon the height, the pinnacle of royalty: then do thou,\nmighty, distribute goods among us!  \n3\\. Thy kinsmen with calls shall come to thee; agile Agni shall go with them\nas messenger! Thy wives, thy sons shall be devoted to thee; being a mighty\n(ruler) thou shalt behold rich tribute!  \n4\\. The Asvins first, Mitra and Varuna both, all the gods, and the Maruts,\nshall call thee! Then fix thy mind upon the bestowal of wealth, then do thou,\nmighty, distribute wealth among us!  \n5\\. Hither hasten forth from the farthest distance heaven and earth, both,\nshall be propitious to thee! Thus did this king Varuna (as if, 'the chooser')\ndecree that; he himself did call thee: 'come thou hither'!  \n6\\. O Indra, Indra, come thou to the tribes of men, for thou hast agreed,\nconcordant with the Varunas (as if,'the electors'), He did call thee to thy\nown domain (thinking): 'let him revere the gods, and manage, too, the people'!  \n7\\. The rich divinities of the roads, of manifold diverse forms, all coming\ntogether have given thee a broad domain. They shall all concordantly call\nthee; rule here, a mighty, benevolent (king), to up the tenth decade (of thy\nlife)!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 5.
