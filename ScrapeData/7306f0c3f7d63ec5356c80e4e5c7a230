For (the text) 'Whatever he does with knowledge' (intimates that).\n\nIn the preceding adhikara _n_ a the following conclusion has been\nestablished:--Works of permanent obligation such as the Agnihotra, if\nperformed by a person desirous of release with a view to release, lead to the\nextinction of evil deeds committed, thus become a means of the purification of\nthe mind, and thereby cause the attainment of Brahman, which leads to final\nrelease; they therefore operate towards the same effect as the knowledge of\nBrahman. Now the Agnihotra and similar works are either connected with a\nspecial knowledge based on the constituent members of the sacrificial work, or\nabsolute (non-connected with such knowledge). This appears from scriptural\ntexts such as 'He who knowing this sacrifices; he who knowing this makes an\noffering; he who knowing this recites; he who knowing this sings; therefore\nlet a man make him who knows this his Brahman-priest\n\np. 361\n\n[paragraph continues] ( _Kh_. Up. IV, 17, i); therefore both perform the work,\nhe who knows this and he who does not know it' ( _Kh_. Up. I, 1, 10).--We have\nnow to consider the question whether only such Agnihotras and so on as are\nconnected with knowledge cause knowledge on the part of him who desires\nrelease and thus operate towards the same effect as knowledge; or whether both\nkinds of works--those connected with knowledge and those not so connected--\nequally act in that way. The doubt concerning this point arises on the one\nhand from scriptural passages such as 'That Self they seek to know by\nsacrifice' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 22), which represent sacrifices and the like,\nwithout difference, as auxiliary to the knowledge of the Self; and on the\nother hand from our observing that a superiority is conceded to Agnihotras,\n&c., if connected with knowledge.\n\nHere the purvapakshin maintains that only such sacrificial works as are\nconnected with knowledge are helpful towards the cognition of the Self, since\nwe understand from various scriptural and Sm _ri_ ti passages that works\nconnected with knowledge are superior to those destitute of knowledge; cp.\ne.g. 'On the very day on which he sacrifices on that day he overcomes death\nagain, he who knows this' (B _ri_. Up. I, 5, 2); and 'Possesser of this\nknowledge thou wilt cast off the bonds of action;' 'Action is far inferior to\nconcentration of mind' (Bha. Gita II, 39; 49).\n\nTo this the Sutrakara replies, 'For what with knowledge only.' It is true that\nworks such as the Agnihotra if joined with knowledge are superior to works\ndestitute of knowledge, in the same way as a Brahma _n_ a possessed of\nknowledge is superior to one devoid of knowledge. Nevertheless works such as\nthe Agnihotra even if not connected with knowledge are not altogether\nineffective; for certain scriptural texts declare that such works are, all of\nthem without any difference, causes of knowledge; so e.g. the passage, 'That\nSelf they seek to know through sacrifices.'--But, as we understand from\nscripture that works connected with knowledge are superior to those destitute\nof knowledge, we must suppose that the Agnihotra and the like if unaccompanied\nby knowledge are inoperative towards the\n\np. 362\n\ncognition of the Self!--By no means, we reply. The proper assumption is that\nthe Agnihotra and so on, if accompanied by knowledge, possess a greater\ncapability of originating knowledge and therefore are of superior causal\nefficiency with regard to the cognition of the Self; while the same works if\ndevoid of knowledge possess no such superiority. We cannot, however, admit\nthat the Agnihotra and similar works which scripture, without making any\ndistinction, declares to subserve knowledge (cp. 'they seek to know through\nsacrifices') should not subserve it. With this our conclusion agrees the\nscriptural text, 'Whatever he performs with knowledge, faith, and the\nUpanishad that is more powerful' ( _Kh_. Up. I, 1, 10); for this text--in\nspeaking of the greater power of work joined with knowledge and thus\nproclaiming the superiority of such work with regard to its effect--intimates\nthereby that work destitute of knowledge possesses some power towards the same\neffect. By the 'power' of work we understand its capacity of effecting its\npurpose. We therefore accept as settled the following conclusion: All works of\npermanent obligation, such as the Agnihotra--whether joined with or devoid of\nknowledge--which have been performed before the rise of true knowledge, either\nin the present state of existence or a former one, by a person desirous of\nrelease with a view to release; all such works act, according to their several\ncapacities, as means of the extinction of evil desert which obstructs the\nattainment of Brahman, and thus become causes of such attainment, subserving\nthe more immediate causes such as the hearing of and reflecting on the sacred\ntexts, faith, meditation, devotion, &c. They therefore operate towards the\nsame effect as the knowledge of Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 1, 19](sbe38280.htm)\n\n"
