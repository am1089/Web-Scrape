Naraya _n_ a said :-- Next to the ocean of pure water, is the mountain,\ncalled Lokaloka. It marks the sphere between the two countries Loka and Aloka.\nO Devar _s_ i! There is a land, all of pure gold (beyond this ocean of pure\nwater) for a space equal to the distance between Manasottara and Meru. This\nland is like a mirror; there are no beings here; the reason is, any substance\nplaced on it would at once be converted into gold and nothing can be obtained\nout of it. O Narada! No living beings can live there and therefore it is named\nLokaloka. This is established always between the Loka and Aloka. The God\nhimself has made this as the boundary of the three Lokas. The rays of the Sun,\nthe Polar Star and all the planets are confined to this sphere; rather passing\nthrough its middle, the luminaries shed their lustre on the three Lokas. O\nNarada! This great mountain is so lofty and capacious that the rays of the\nluminaries can never go out of it. The learned men say, that the size, form,\nand indications of this mountain are such as this is the one-fourth of five\nhundred times the size of the earth on its summit. The self-born Brahma has\nplaced very big elephants on all sides of it. Hear\n\n\n\np. 772\n\n\n\ntheir names. These are _R_ i _s_ abha, Pu _s_ pachuda, Vamana, and Aparajita.\nThese four elephants are said to hold all the Lokas in their respective\npositions. The Bhagavan Hari gives strength to these elephants and to Indra\nand others who are reckoned to be His Vibhutis (powers). He manifesting His\nS\xc2\x92uddha Sattva and super-extraordinary powers, and united with A _n_ ima,\nLaghima, etc., the eight Siddhis, is reigning there surrounded by His\nParis\xc2\x92adas Vi _s_ vaksena and others. He is the one God of all; He is without\na second. For the welfare of all, He is holding Sudars\xc2\x92ana and His various\nother weapons; and the powers of His arms are great. He is His own Cause and\nat all times He pervades all in and through. He is Eternal. This Universe is\nupheld by His extraordinary power Maya for its preservation. He remains in\nthis form till the end of a Kalpa. The inner width described above, determines\nthe width of \xc3\x82loka. For it is situated outside the above Loka. Beyond the\nmountain Lokaloka, is said to lie the pure path leading to Yoges\xc2\x92vara within\nthe egg-shaped ellipsoid formed by the Heaven and Earth. The inner dimension\nof this ellipsoid is twenty five Ko _t_ i Yoyanas. When this egg becomes\nunconscious (lifeless), the Sun enters within it in the form of Vairaja. Hence\nthe Sun is called Marta _nd_ a. He is Hira _n_ yagarbha, when He is born from\nthis Golden Egg. It is this Sun that ordains the quarters, \xc3\x82kas\xc2\x92a, Heaven and\nEarth, etc., in their proper spheres and divisions. This Sun is the \xc3\x82tma of\nSvarga and Mok _s_ a, hell and other lower regions, of the Devas, men, birds,\nreptiles, trees and all other living beings; and He is the Presiding Deity of\ntheir sight. O Narada! Its width is Pa\xc3\xb1chas\xc2\x92a _t_ Ko _t_ i Yoyanas and its\nheight or depth is twenty-five Ko _t_ i Yoyanas. If as the two halves of a\ngram are of the same size, so the Earth and Heaven are of equal size. The\nspace enclosed between them is called Antarik _s_ a; the Sun God, the foremost\nof the planets, being situated in the middle, gives light and illumines and\nheats the three Lokas. He goes by the path of Uttaraya _n_ a and therefore His\nmotion becomes slow (His motion becomes Mandagati). The Sun then getting up\nhigher prolongs the day time. Similarly when the Sun follows the path of Dak\n_s_ i _n_ ayana, He gets S\xc2\x92ighra-gati and not going up so high, shortens the\nday time. Again when He comes at the Equator, He maintains an even position\nand the day and night become equal. When the Sun is in the signs Aries (Me _s_\na) and Libra (Tula), then the day and night become equal. When the Sun\ntraverses the five signs Taurus, Gemini, etc., the day becomes longer and when\nthe Sun traverses the five signs Scorpio and others, the day becomes shorter\nand the night becomes longer.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fourteenth Chapter of the Eighth Book on the\n\n\n\np. 773\n\n\n\ndescription of the Lokaloka space in the Mahapura _n_ am S'ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam, of 18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 15](bk08ch15.htm)\n\n"
