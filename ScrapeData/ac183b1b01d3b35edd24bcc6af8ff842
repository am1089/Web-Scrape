After having (knowingly) drunk water from a vessel in which spirituous\nliquor had been kept, he must drink for seven days milk boiled together with\nthe _S_ a _n_ khapushpi plant.\n\n[17. Nand. considers the term patatrin to refer to crows only in this place.\nKulluka (on M. IV, 208) interprets it by \'crows and the like.\' See also Gaut.\nXVII, 10.\n\n20\\. See Dr. Buhler\'s notes on Gaut. XVI 19, 31.]\n\np. 165\n\n24\\.

Likewise, for eating (unawares the flesh of) animals whose hoof is not\ncloven (such as horses),\n\n[26. Nand. argues from a passage of Pra _k_ etas, that the flesh of the\nfollowing other animals, dogs, jackals, cocks, boars, carnivorous animals in\ngeneral, Gangetic porpoises, apes, elephants, horses, tame hogs, cows, and\nhuman beings, is also implied here. But if that were the case, Sutra 26 would\nbe partly a mere repetition of, and partly opposed to, the rules laid down in\nSutras 33 and 22.\n\n27\\. 1 Nand. infers from a passage of the Brahma-pura _n_ a, that the use of\nthe particle _k_ a further implies a prohibition to eat the flesh on the back,\nor flesh which had been interred in the ground, or covered with earth, fried\nmeat, and the flesh of the uterus.]\n\np. 166\n\nor of animals having a double row of teeth (such as the Rohita deer).\n\n31\\. For eating (unawares) the flesh of any bird, excepting the francoline\npartridge, the Kapi\xc3\xb1 _g_ ala, the (quail called) Lavaka, the peahen, and the\npeacock, (he must fast) for a day and a night.\n\n32\\. For eating (knowingly) insects (ants and others), he must drink for one\nday (water in which the plant) Brahmasuvar _k_ ala (has been boiled).\n\n33\\. For eating (unawares) the flesh of dogs, he must perform the same\npenance[1].\n\n34\\. For eating (unawares the mushroom called) _Kh_ attraka, or (the mushroom\ncalled) Kavaka, he must perform the Santapana penance.\n\n35\\. For eating (unawares) stale food, other than a mess prepared with barley\n(such as cakes), or with wheat (such as, gruel), or with milk (boiled with\nrice, or mixed with coagulated milk, or otherwise dressed), and dishes\nsprinkled with fat (such as clarified butter), sour gruel, and sweetmeats, he\nmust fast (for one day).\n\n36\\. Likewise, (for eating unawares) the juice flowing from an incision in a\ntree, (plants raised in) unclean substances (such as excrements and the like),\nand the red exudation of trees.\n\n37\\. Also, (for eating unawares) the root of the water-lily; (and for eating)\nrice boiled with sesamum. or with beans, Sa _m_ yava[1], rice boiled in milk\nwith sugar, pastry, _S_ ashkuli (cakes), or food destined for\n\n[33. 1 \'And he must perform the Santapana penance mentioned in the next Sutra,\nas the use of the particle _k_ a implies.\' (Nand.)\n\n37\\. 1 Nand. interprets this term by utkarika, which, according to Wilson, is\na sort of sweetmeat made with milk, treacle, and clarified butter. Kulluka (on\nM. V, 7) has a somewhat different interpretation.]\n\np. 167\n\nthe gods, if those dishes have not been announced to the gods first; and (for\neating) food destined for burnt-oblations.\n\n38\\. Also, for tasting the milk of any animal, save the milk of cows, goats,\nand buffalos (and for tasting any eatables made of such milk)[1].\n\n39\\. Also, (for tasting the milk) of those animals (cows and the rest) within\nten days after their giving birth to a young one.\n\n40\\. And (for tasting) the milk of a cow whose milk flows of itself, of one\nthat has just taken the bull[1], or of one whose calf is dead[2].\n\n41\\. And (for tasting the milk of a cow) that has been feeding upon ordures.\n\n42\\. And (for tasting) any such food as has turned sour (but not that which is\nsour by nature, like sorrel), except sour milk (and what is made with it).\n\n43\\. A student, who partakes (unawares) of a _S_ raddha repast, must fast for\nthree days.\n\n44\\. And he must remain in water for a whole day (afterwards).\n\n45\\. If he eats honey or meat (at any time), he must perform the Pra _g_\napatya penance.\n\n46\\. If any one eats (unawares) the leavings of the\n\n[38. 1 Nand. infers from the use of the particle _k_ a that the same penance\nis ordained for tasting any other production of those animals, as e. g. their\nexcrements.\n\n40\\. 1 Sandhini means \'a cow that has just taken the bull,\' or \'a female\nanimal that gives milk once a day,\' or \'a cow that is milked by the calf of\nanother cow.\' (Nand.) Haradatta (see \xc3\x82past. I, 5, 17, 23; Gaut. XVII, 25)\ninterprets it by \'an animal giving milk while big with young.\' For other\ninterpretations, see the Petersburg Dictionary.--2 \'The particle _k_ a\nindicates that animals bearing twins have also to be included in this\nprohibition.\' (Nand.) See Gaut. loc. cit.]\n\np. 168\n\nfood of a cat, of a crow, of an ichneumon, or of a rat, he must drink water in\nwhich the Brahmasuvar _k_ ala plant has been boiled.\n\n47\\. For eating (unawares) what has been left by a dog, he must fast for one\nday, and drink Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ agavya (afterwards).\n\n48\\. For tasting (knowingly) the excrements of five-toed animals (excepting\nhuman excrements), he must (fast) for seven days (and drink Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ agavya on\nthe eighth).\n\n49\\. If one (not a student) eats (unawares) of a _S_ raddha repast consisting\nof raw food, he must subsist on milk for seven days.\n\n50\\. If a Brahma _n_ a eats what has been left by a _S_ udra, (he must also\nsubsist on milk) for seven days.\n\n51\\. If he eats what has been left by a Vai _s_ ya, (he must subsist upon\nmilk) for five days.\n\n52\\. If he eats what has been left by a Kshatriya, (he must subsist upon milk)\nfor three days.\n\n53\\. If he eats what has been left by another Brahma _n_ a, (he must subsist\nupon milk) for one day.\n\n54\\. If a Kshatriya eats what has been left by a _S_ udra, (he must undergo\nthe same penance) for five days.\n\n55\\. If he eats what has been left by a Vai _s_ ya, (he must undergo it) for\nthree days;\n\n56\\. And so must a Vai _s_ ya, if he eats what has been left by a _S_ udra.\n\n[50. Nand. explains that he should drink Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ agavya alternately with milk.\nThis explanation extends to the following Sutras also (up to Sutra 56). He\nfurther argues from another Smriti text that the term _S_ udra means \' _S_\nudras and women\' here.]\n\np. 169\n\n57\\. For (knowingly) eating (undressed) food, which has been left by a _K_ a\n_nd_ ala (or Svapa _k_ a or other member of the seven lowest castes), he must\nfast for three days.\n\n58\\. For (unawares) eating dressed food (left by such), the Paraka penance is\nordained.\n\n59\\. Let no Brahma _n_ a ever eat (the flesh of) beasts which has not been\nconsecrated with Mantras; but if it has been consecrated with Mantras, he may\neat it, following the eternal rule (laid down in the Veda).\n\n60\\. As many hairs as the beast has, which he has slain in this world, for so\nmany days will the killer of a beast for other purposes than a ( _S_ rauta or\nSmarta) sacrifice, suffer terrible pangs in this world and in the next[1].\n\n61\\. It is for sacrifices that beasts have been created by the Self-existent\n(Brahman) himself. Sacrificing causes the whole universe to prosper; therefore\nis the slaughter (of beasts) for a sacrifice no slaughter.\n\n62\\. The sin of him who kills deer for the sake of gain, is not so great (and\nvisited less heavily) in the world to come, than the sin of him who eats meat\nwhich has not been offered to the gods.\n\n63\\. Plants, cattle, trees, amphibious animals, and birds, which have been\ndestroyed for the purposes of sacrifice, obtain exaltation in another\nexistence (in which they are born as Gandharvas, or other beings of a high\nrank).\n\n[60. 1 My translation follows Nand. It is, however, doubtful, whether the\nreading is correct; see Manu V, 38.\n\n62\\. This is because the former kills animals in order to support his family,\nwhereas the latter eats meat merely in order to tickle his palate. (Nand.)]\n\np. 170\n\n64\\. When honouring a guest, at a sacrifice, or when worshipping the manes, or\nthe gods, a man may slay cattle, but not otherwise on any account.\n\n65\\. That twice-born man who, knowing the exact truth (promulgated) in the\nVeda, slays cattle for the sacrifices (ordained in the Veda), will convey\nhimself and the cattle (slain by him) to a blissful abode.\n\n66\\. A self-controlled[1] man of a twice-born caste, whether he be a\nhouseholder, or be dwelling with his spiritual teacher, or in the forest, must\nnever slay an animal in opposition to the precepts of the Veda, even in cases\nof distress.\n\n67\\. That slaughter which is in accordance with the precepts of the Veda, and\nhas been fixed for this world of movable and immovable creatures, should be\nconsidered as no slaughter at all; because it is from the Veda that law shines\nforth.\n\n68\\. He who hurts animals that do not hurt any one, merely in order to afford\npleasure to himself, will never obtain happiness, whether living or dead[1].\n\n69\\. He who gives no living creature intentionally the pain of confining or\nkilling (or hurting) it, from benevolence towards all (creatures), will enjoy\neverlasting happiness.\n\n70\\. Whatever he thinks of, whatever he strives for, and whatever he desires\nin his heart, all that is easily obtained by him who does not injure any\ncreated being.\n\n71\\. Meat cannot be obtained without injuring an\n\n[66. 1 Nand. interprets the term atmavan by sa _m_ nyasi, \'an ascetic, or\nmember of the fourth order,\' apparently because the first three orders are\nmentioned in this _S_ loka. I have followed Kulluka\'s interpretation (on M.V,\n43).\n\n68\\. 1 \'But it is no sin to kill tigers or other beasts of prey.\' (Nand.)]\n\np. 171\n\nanimal, and the murder of animals excludes the murderer from heaven, therefore\nmust meat be avoided.\n\n72\\. Reflecting upon the origin of flesh[1] and upon the (sin of) hurting or\nconfining animated creatures, he must abstain from animal food of any kind.\n\n73\\. He who transgresses not the law and eats not flesh like a Pisa _k_ a, is\nbeloved by men and remains free from disease.\n\n74\\. He who gives his consent to the killing of an animal, he who cuts it up,\nhe who kills it, the purchaser and the seller, he who prepares it, he who\nserves it up, and he who eats it, all these are denominated slaughterers of an\nanimal.\n\n75\\. There is no greater sinner than he who, without giving their share to the\nmanes and to the gods, wants to increase his own flesh with the flesh of\nanother creature.\n\n76\\. Those two, he who performs a horse-sacrifice annually for a hundred years\nand he who does not eat meat, shall both obtain the same recompense for their\nvirtue.\n\n77\\. By eating (wild rice or other) sacred fruits or roots, and by living upon\nsuch grains as are the food of hermits, a man does not reap so high a reward\nas by avoiding meat\n\n78\\. (An eater of flesh must say within himself), Me he (ma _m_ sa) will eat\nin the next world, whose\n\n[72. 1 The human soul is enveloped in six sheaths, three of which come from\nthe father, and three from the mother. The three that come from the mother are\nskin, flesh, and blood. Now flesh is said in the _S_ ruti to be derived from\nthe menstrual discharge, and the latter is one of the species of forbidden\nfood. (Nand.)]\n\np. 172\n\nflesh I am tasting here.[1] This, say the learned, is the derivation of the\nword flesh (ma _m_ sa).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: LII.](sbe07054.htm)\n\n'
