(They are) conductors, this being indicated.\n\nWith regard to those beginning with light a doubt arises whether they are\nmarks of the road, or places of enjoyment, or leaders of the travelling souls.\n--The first possible view of the question is that light and so on are marks of\nthe road, because the instruction has that character. For as in ordinary life\na man wishing to go to a village or a town is told, 'Go from here to that\nhill, from there to a fig-tree, from that to a river, from that to a village;\nafter that you will reach the town;' so here the text also says, 'from light\nto day, from day to the waxing half of the month,' &c.--Or else light and so\non may be viewed as places of enjoyment. For the text connects Agni and so on\nwith the word 'world'; 'He comes to the world of Agni,' &c. Now the term\n'world' is used to denote places of enjoyment of living beings, as when we\nsay, 'The world of men; the world of the Fathers; the world of the gods.' A\nBrahma _n_ a passage also says, 'They remain attached to the worlds which\nconsist of day and night' (Sat. Bra. X, 2, 6, 8). Therefore light and the rest\nare not conductors. Moreover, they cannot be conductors because they are\nwithout intelligence. For in ordinary life intelligent men only are appointed\nby the king to conduct travellers over difficult roads.\n\nTo all this we reply as follows. They must be conductors, because the text\nindicates this. For we read, 'From the moon to the lightning; there a person\nthat is not a man leads them to Brahman;' which shows their conductorship to\nbe something settled. Should it be objected that this last sentence exhausts\nitself in conveying its own purport 1; we say No; for the attribute ('that is\nnot a man') has only the meaning of excluding his previously established\nhumanity. Only if in the case of the light and the rest personal conductors\nare settled, and those of human nature, it is appropriate to use the attribute\n\np. 388\n\n[paragraph continues] 'amanava,' to the end of excluding this (previously\nestablished) humanity 1.\n\nBut mere indication has no force, as there is nothing to prove (that there\nmust be such personal conductors).--To this objection the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[387:1](sbe38305.htm#fr_227) And has not the additional power of indicating,\ni.e. enabling us to infer that also the beings previously mentioned are\n'leaders' of the soul.\n\n[388:1](sbe38305.htm#fr_228) Why should it be specially stated that this\n'conducting person' is amanava? Only, because it is a settled matter that the\npreviously mentioned beings are also 'conducting persons,' and at the same\ntime 'manava.' The last clause therefore does not only directly teach that a\nperson conducts the souls to Brahman, but at the same time 'indicates' that\nthe beings mentioned before in connexion with the road are also 'personal\nconductors.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 3, 5](sbe38306.htm)\n\n"
