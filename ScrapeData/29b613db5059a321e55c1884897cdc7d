And for the same reason (the departed soul follows the rays) also during\nthe southern progress of the sun.\n\nFor the same reason, viz. because waiting is impossible, and because the fruit\nof knowledge is not a merely eventual one, and because the time of death is\nnot fixed, also that possessor of true knowledge who dies during the southern\nprogress of the sun obtains the fruit of his knowledge. Because dying during\nthe northern progress of the sun is more excellent, and because Bhishma is\nknown to have waited for that period, and because scripture says, 'From the\nlight half of the month (they go) to the six months when the sun goes to the\nnorth,' it might be thought that the northern progress of the sun is needful\nfor dying. This notion the Sutra refutes. The greater excellence of the sun's\nnorthern progress applies to those only who do not possess the highest\nknowledge.--Bhishma's waiting for the sun's northern progress was due to his\nwish of upholding good customs and of showing that by the favour of his father\nhe could choose the time of his death.--And the sense of the scriptural\npassage quoted will be explained under IV, 3, 4.--But we have the following Sm\n_ri_ ti-text, 'At what times the Yogins depart either not to return or to\nreturn, those times I will declare to thee' (Bha. Gita VIII, 23), which\ndetermines specially that to die by day and so on causes the soul not to\nreturn. How then can he who dies by night or during the sun's southern\nprogress depart not to return? Concerning this point the next Sutra remarks:\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 2, 21](sbe38301.htm)\n\n"
