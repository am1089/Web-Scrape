On the following day he touches a cow with a Darbha blade, with the words,\n'I touch thee agreeable to the Fathers.'\n\n4. 4 Having silently offered five \xc3\x82 _g_ ya oblations, and having cooked, the omentum of the (cow), and performed the 'spreading under' and the sprinkling over (of \xc3\x82 _g_ ya), he sacrifices (the omentum) with the next (verse, II, 20, 28) with a Pala _s_ a leaf from the middle or the end (of the stalk).\n\n5\\. (He sacrifices) boiled rice together with the meat (of the cow) with the\nnext (verses, II, 20, 29-35),\n\n6\\. Food prepared of meal with the next (verse, II, 21, 1),\n\n7\\. Then the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya oblations (indicated by the) next (Mantras, II, 21,\n2-9).\n\n8\\. (The rites) from the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t down to the offering of the Pi\n_n_ _d_ as are the same (as at the _S_ raddha).\n\n9\\. Some (teachers) prescribe the Pi _n_ _d_ a offering for the day after the\nAsh _t_ aka.\n\n10\\. Here (follows) another (way for celebrating the Ash _t_ aka sacrifice).\nHe sacrifices curds with his joined hands in the same way as the cake.\n\n11\\. Having left over from the meat of the (cow, see above, 3. 4) as much as\nis required, on the day after (the Ash _t_ aka) (he performs) the rite of the\nAnvash _t_ aka.\n\n12\\. This rite has been explained in the description of the monthly _S_\nraddha.\n\n13\\. If he goes out in order to beg for something,\n\np. 295\n\nlet him murmur the next (Mantras, II, 21, 10-16) and then state his desire.\n\n14\\. If he has obtained a chariot, he has the horses put to it, lets it face\nthe east, and touches with the next (verse, II, 21, 17) the two wheels of the\nchariot or the two side-pieces.\n\n15\\. With the next Ya _g_ us (II, 21, 18) he should mount, and drive with the\nnext (verse, II, 21, 19) towards the east or north, and should then drive off\non his business.\n\n16\\. Let him mount a horse with the next (formulas, II, 21, 20-30),\n\n17\\. An elephant with the next (formula, II, 21, 31).\n\n18. 18 If any harm is done him by these two (beasts), let him touch the earth as indicated above.\n\n19\\. If he is going to a dispute, he takes the parasol and the staff in his\nleft hand.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[293:1](sbe30115.htm#fr_790) 22, 1. Comp. above, VII, 18, 6.\n\n[293:2](sbe30115.htm#fr_791) I believe that _s_ esha _h_ means the rest of the\ncake. The word 'siddha _h_ ' possibly refers to such preparations of the food\nas are indicated in Hira _n_ yak. II, 5, 14, 7. Haradatta understands _s_ esha\n_h_ as the rest of the rites (tantrasya _s_ esha _h_ ): 'The rest of the rites\nis p. 294 the regular one, without alterations:' it must be admitted that the\nexpressions used by Hira _n_ yak. II, 5, 14, 10 would agree well with this\nexplanation.\n\n[294:4](sbe30115.htm#fr_792) See above, V, 13, 16.\n\n[295:18](sbe30115.htm#fr_793) See VII, 19, 11.
