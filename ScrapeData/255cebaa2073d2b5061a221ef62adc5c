[1885], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n4:1:4\n\n### FOURTH BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n4:1:4:11\\. Mitra and Varu _n_ a, forsooth, are his intelligence and will; and\nas such belonging to his self: whenever he desires anything in his mind, as\n'Would that this were mine! I might do this!' that is intelligence; and\nwhenever that is accomplished, that is will 4. Now intelligence indeed is\nMitra, and will is\n\np. 270\n\n[paragraph continues] Varu _n_ a; and Mitra is the priesthood, and Varu _n_ a\nthe nobility; and the priesthood is the conceiver, and the noble is the doer.\n\n4:1:4:22\\. Now in the beginning these two, the priesthood and the nobility,\nwere separate: then Mitra, the priesthood, could stand without Varu _n_ a, the\nnobility.\n\n4:1:4:33\\. Not Varu _n_ a, the nobility, without Mitra, the priesthood:\nwhatever deed Varu _n_ a did unsped by Mitra, the priesthood, therein,\nforsooth, he succeeded not.\n\n4:1:4:44\\. Varu _n_ a, the nobility, then called upon Mitra, the priesthood,\nsaying, 'Turn thou unto me that we may unite: I will place thee foremost, sped\nby thee, I will do deeds!'--'So be it!' So the two united; and therefrom\nresulted that graha to Mitra and Varu _n_ a.\n\n4:1:4:55\\. Such, then, is the office of Purohita (placed foremost, domestic\npriest). Wherefore let not a Brahman desire to become the Purohita of any one\nKshatriya (he may meet with), as thereby righteousness and unrighteousness\nunite; nor should a Kshatriya make any Brahman (he may meet with) his\nPurohita, as thereby righteousness and unrighteousness unite.--Whatever deed,\nsped by Mitra, the priesthood, Varu _n_ a thenceforward did, in that he\nsucceeded.\n\n4:1:4:66\\. Hence it is quite proper that a Brahman should be without a king,\nbut were he to obtain a king, it would be conducive to the success (of both).\nIt is, however, quite improper that a king should be without a Brahman, for\nwhatever deed he does, unsped by Mitra, the priesthood, therein he succeeds\nnot. Wherefore a Kshatriya who intends to do a deed ought by all means to\nresort to a Brahman, for\n\np. 271\n\nhe verily succeeds only in the deed sped by the Brahman.\n\n4:1:4:77\\. Now he draws (the Maitra-varu _n_ a graha) from that (stream of\nSoma) 1, with (Va _g_. S. VII, 9; Rig-veda II, 41, 4), 'This Soma, O Mitra and\nVaru _n_ a, hath been pressed for you; ye holy, now hear my cry!--Thou art\ntaken with a support 2!--Thee for Mitra and Varu _n_ a!'\n\n4:1:4:88\\. He mixes it with milk. The reason why he mixes it with milk is\nthis. Soma, forsooth, was V _ri_ tra. Now when the gods slew him, they said to\nMitra, 'Thou also slayest!' But he liked it not and said, 'Surely, I am every\none's friend (mitra): being no friend, I shall become an enemy (or, other than\nMitra, Amitra).'--'Then we shall exclude thee from the sacrifice!'--Then said\nhe, 'I, too, slay!' Thereupon the cattle went from him, saying, 'Being a\nfriend, he has become an enemy!' Thus he was deprived of the cattle. By mixing\n(the Soma) with milk, the gods then supplied him with cattle; and in like\nmanner does this (priest) now supply him (the sacrificer or Mitra) with cattle\nby mixing (the Soma) with milk.\n\n4:1:4:99\\. As to this they say, 'Surely he liked it not to slay!' Thus, what\nmilk there is in this (mixture) that belongs to Mitra, but the Soma belongs to\nVaru _n_ a: therefore one mixes it with milk.\n\n4:1:4:1010\\. He mixes it with (Va _g_. S. VII, 10; Rig-veda IV, 42, 10), 'May\nwe delight in the wealth we have gained, the gods in the offering, the kine in\npasture! that unfailing milch cow,\n\np. 272\n\n[paragraph continues] O Mitra and Varu _n_ a, grant ye unto us day by day!'--\nwith 'This is thy womb: thee for truth and life 1!' he deposits it. Now as to\nwhy he says, 'Thee for truth and life,'--the truth is Mitra 2, since Mitra is\nthe Brahman, and the truth is the Brahman (sacerdotium or sacred writ);--and\nlife is Varu _n_ a, since Varu _n_ a is the year, and life is the year:\ntherefore he says, 'This is thy womb: thee for truth and life!'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[269:1](sbe2642.htm#fr_647) When the cup is half-filled he withdraws it for a\nmoment from the stream of Soma flowing from the Hot _ri_ 's cup into the Dro\n_n_ akala _s_ a trough; after which he again holds it under to have it filled\ncompletely. For the shape of this cup, see [IV, I, 5,\n19](sbe2644.htm#4:1:5:19).\n\n[269:2](sbe2642.htm#fr_648) See [IV, 1, 2, 6](sbe2641.htm#4:1:2:6), with note.\n\n[269:3](sbe2642.htm#fr_649) See [IV, 1, 2, 9](sbe2641.htm#4:1:2:9) with note.\n\n[269:4](sbe2643.htm#fr_650) The Ka _n_ va text adds, tad asyaitav atmana _h_ ,\n'and these two are of his self,' which seems to be intended to explain the\npreceding adhyatmam, 'belonging to his self.' See [IV, 1, 3,\n1](sbe2642.htm#4:1:3:1), with note.\n\n[271:1](sbe2643.htm#fr_651) See [p. 256](sbe2640.htm#page_256), note\n[1](sbe2641.htm#fn_619). For the shape of this cup, see [IV, 1, 5,\n19](sbe2644.htm#4:1:5:19).\n\n[271:2](sbe2643.htm#fr_652) See [IV, 1, 2, 6](sbe2641.htm#4:1:2:6), and note.\n\n[272:1](sbe2643.htm#fr_653) This is a false analysis of _ri_ tayu, 'righteous,\nholy.'\n\n[272:2](sbe2643.htm#fr_654) The text has 'Brahman,' which must be wrong. The\nKa _n_ va recension has, correctly, mitro va _ri_ tam, brahma hi mitro, brahma\nhy _ri_ tam.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 1, 5. Fifth Brahma _n_ a](sbe2644.htm)\n\n"
