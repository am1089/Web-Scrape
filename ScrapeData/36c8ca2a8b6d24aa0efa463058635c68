Now if a man feels his conscience charged with some guilty act (such as\nperforming a sacrifice for, or accepting a gift from, unworthy persons, or\neating excrements) committed by himself (or if his conscience tells him that\nhe has done more evil than good, or if he thinks himself less pure than\nothers), let him boil a handful of barley-gruel for the sake of his own\nspiritual welfare.\n\n2\\. Let him not make the (customary) Vai _s_ vadeva offering after that.\n\n3\\. Neither must he make the Bali offerings.\n\n4\\. Let him consecrate with Mantras the barley, before it has been put to the\nfire, while it is being boiled, and after it has been boiled.\n\n5\\. Let him watch the barley, while it is being boiled (muttering at the same\ntime the following Mantra):\n\n6\\. 'Soma, who is the highest priest among priests (gods), leader among the\nwise, _Ri_ shi among bards, the falcon among rapacious birds, the Svadhiti\ntree among trees, trickles murmuring through the filter[1].'\n\n[XLVIII. 1. Gaut. XIX, 13.\n\n2, 3, Regarding the regular oblations which have to be offered at meal times\n&c. to the Vi _s_ vedevas and to all beings (bhutani), see LIX, 22, 24;\nLXVIII, 1-22.\n\n4\\. The Mantras are given below, 17-22.\n\n6\\. 1 Rig-veda IX, 96, 6. Regarding the translation of this verse, see Dr.\nZimmer's remarks, Altindisches Leben, p. 207.]\n\np. 154\n\nWith these words he must fasten blades of Ku _s_ a grass (round the neck of\nthe kettle).\n\n7\\. The pulse having been boiled, he must pour it into another vessel and eat\nit.\n\n8\\. Let him help himself to it, while muttering the Mantra, 'The gods, who\nhave sprung up in the mind and satisfy the mind, who are gifted with great\nenergy, and whose father is Daksha, shall protect and help us. To them be Nama\n_h_ (adoration), to them be Svaha (hail).'\n\n9\\. Then, after having sipped water, let him seize the centre (of the vessel)\nand mutter the Mantra:\n\n10\\. 'Be satisfied in our stomach, O ye waters, and ye barley-corns, after\nhaving been bathed; they shall be salubrious to us, conferring bliss, causing\nhealth, divine, causing immortality, and increasers of _Ri_ ta (truth and\njustice).'\n\n11\\. One desirous of wisdom (must perform this rite) for three days;\n\n12\\. A sinner, for six days.\n\n13\\. Any of the mortal sinners (killers of a Brahma _n_ a, stealers of gold,\nand the rest) becomes purified by swallowing it for seven days.\n\n14\\. Swallowing it for twelve nights effaces even sins committed by an\nancestor;\n\n15\\. Swallowing it for a month, every sin (whether light or heavy, and whether\ncommitted by himself or by an ancestor).\n\n16\\. And so does swallowing barley-corns dissolved in the excrements of a cow\nfor twenty-one days (efface every sin).\n\n17\\. 'Thou art barley, thou the king of grains,\n\n[8. Taittiriya Sa _m_ hita I, 2, 3, 1. See also Va _g_ asaneyi Sa _m_ hita IV,\nII, &c.]\n\np. 155\n\nthou water mixed with honey; the _Ri_ shis have proclaimed thee an expeller of\nevery kind of guilt and an instrument of purification.\n\n18\\. 'You are clarified butter and honey, O ye barley-corns; you are water and\nambrosia, O ye barley-corns. May you efface whatever sinful acts I have\ncommitted:\n\n19\\. 'Sins committed by words, by acts, and by evil thoughts. Avert distress\nand ill-fortune from me, O ye barley-corns.\n\n20\\. 'Purify food licked at by dogs or pigs, or defiled by leavings (of food),\nand (purify me from the stain) of disobedience towards mother and father, O ye\nbarley-corns.\n\n21\\. 'Purify for me food given by a multitude of persons, the food of a\nharlot, or of a Sudra, food offered at a _S_ raddha, food rendered impure by\nthe birth of a child in the house, the food of a thief, and food offered at a\nNava _s_ raddha (or new _S_ raddha, which takes place on the first, third,\nfifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh day after a person's demise).\n\n22\\. 'Purify me, O ye barley-corns, from the sin of injuring a child or of\ncausing (a punishment) to be inflicted on some one by the king, from theft of\ngold (or other high crimes), from the violation of a religious duty, from\nperforming a sacrifice for an unworthy person, and from abusing a Brahma _n_\na.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XLIX.](sbe07051.htm)\n\n"
