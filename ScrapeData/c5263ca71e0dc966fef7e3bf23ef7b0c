Prayer for exemption from the dangers of death.\n\n1\\. Take hold of this (charm) that subjects to immortality (life), may thy\nlife unto old age not be cut off! I bring to thee anew breath and life: not to\nmist and darkness, do not waste away!  \n2\\. Come hither to the light of the living; I rescue thee unto a life of a\nhundred autumns! Loosing the bands of death and imprecation, I bestow upon\nthee long life extended very far.  \n3\\. From the wind thy breath I have obtained, from the sun thine eye; thy soul\nI hold fast in thee: be together with thy limbs, speak articulating with thy\ntongue!  \n4\\. With the breath of two-footed and four-footed creatures I blow upon thee,\nas on Agni when he is born (as on fire when kindled). I have paid reverence, O\ndeath, to thine eye, reverence to thy breath.  \n5\\. This (man) shall live and shall not die: we rouse this man (to life)! I\nmake for him a remedy: O death, do not slay the man!  \n6\\. The plant givala (quickening'), na-gha-risha ('forsooth-no-harm'), and\ngivanti ('living), a victorious, mighty saviour-plant do I invoke, that he may\nbe exempt from injury.  \n7\\. Befriend him, do not seize him, let him go, (O death); though he be thy\nvery own, let him abide here with unimpaired strength! O Bhava and Sarva, take\npity, grant Protection; misfortune drive away, and life bestow!  \n8\\. Befriend him, death, and pity him: may he from here arise! Unharmed, with\nsound limbs, hearing perfectly, through old age carrying a hundred years, let\nhim get enjoyment by himself (unaided)!  \n9\\. The missile of the gods shall pass thee by! I pass thee across the mist\n(of death); from death I have rescued thee. Removing far the flesh-devouring\nAgni, a barrier do I set around thee, that thou mayest live.  \n10\\. From thy misty road that cannot be withstood, O death, from this path (of\nthine) we guard this (man), and make our charm a protection for him.  \n11\\. In-breathing and out-breathing. do I prepare for thee, death in old age,\nlong life, and prosperity. All the messengers of Yama, that roam about,\ndispatched by Vivasvant's son, do I drive away.  \n12\\. Arati (grudge), Nirriti (destruction), Grahi (seizure), and the flesh-\ndevouring Pisakas (do we drive) away to a distance, and hurl all wicked\nRakshas away into darkness as it were.  \n13\\. I crave thy life's breath from the immortal, life-possessing Agni\nGatavedas. That thou shalt not take harm, shalt be immortal in (Agni's)\ncompany, that do I procure for thee, and that shall be fulfilled for thee!  \n14\\. May heaven and earth, the bestowers of happiness, be auspicious and\nharmless to thee; may the sun-shine, and the wind blow comfort to thy heart;\nmay the heavenly waters, rich in milk, flow upon thee kindly!  \n15\\. May the plants be auspicious to thee! I have raised thee from the lower\nto the upper earth: there may both the \xc3\x82dityas, the sun and the moon, .\nprotect thee.  \n16\\. Whatever garment for clothing, or whatever girdle thou makest for\nthyself, agreeable to thy body do we render it; not rough to thy touch shall\nit be!  \n17\\. When thou, the barber, shearest with thy sharp well-whetted razor our\nhair and beard, do not, while cleansing our face, rob us of our life!  \n18\\. Rice and barley shall be auspicious to thee, causing no balasa,\ninflicting no injury! They two drive away disease, they two release from\ncalamity.  \n19\\. Whatever thou eatest or drinkest, the grain of the plough-land or milk,\nwhatever is or is not to be eaten, all that food do I render for thee free\nfrom poison.  \n20\\. To day and to night both do we commit thee: from the demons that seek to\ndevour, do ye preserve this (man) for me!  \n21\\. A hundred years, ten thousand years, two, three, four ages (yuga) do we\nallot to thee; Indra and Agni, and all the gods without anger shall favour\nthee!  \n22\\. To autumn thee, to winter, spring and summer, do we commit; the rains in\nwhich grow the plants shall be pleasant to thee!  \n23\\. Death rules over bipeds, death rules over quadrupeds. From that death,\nthe lord of cattle, do I rescue thee: do not fear!  \n24\\. Free from harm thou shalt not die; thou shalt not die: do not fear!\nVerily, they do not die there, they do not go to the nethermost darkness;--  \n25\\. Verily, every creature lives there, the cow, the horse, and man, where\nthis charm is performed, as the (protecting) barrier for life.  \n26\\. May it preserve thee from sorcery, from thy equals and thy kin! Undying\nbe, immortal, exceedingly vital; thy spirits shall not abandon thy body!  \n27\\. From the one and a hundred deaths, from the dangers that are\nsurmountable, from that Agai Vaisvanara (the funeral pyre?) may the gods\ndeliver thee!  \n28\\. Thou, the remedy called p6tudru, art the body of Agni, the deliverer,\nslayer of Rakshas, slayer of rivals, moreover thou chasest away disease.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V. 30.
