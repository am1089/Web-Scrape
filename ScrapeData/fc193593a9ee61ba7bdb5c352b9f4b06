Compare the state and habits of Huri and Muhadeo;\none is the husband of Luchmee, the other of Devee; the one wears a garland of\nflowers, the other, a necklace of skulls; the former has a quoit in his hand,\nthe latter a trident; one supports the earth; the other, the Ganges; one plays\nupon a pipe, the other, upon a cow\'s horn; one is lord of the celestial\nparadise, the other, an inhabitant of Keilas, the former besmears his body\nwith sandal, the latter rubs ashes on it; one wears cloth, the other, a\ntiger\'s skin; one reads the Vedas, the other, the science of Astrology; one\nrides upon the sovereign of the feathered race, the other, upon the bull\nNundee; one dwells among cowherds\' children, the other, amongst ghosts and\ngoblins. The habits and nature of each of the two lords are the reverse of\nthose of the other. Fix your affections on either of the two according to the\nnature of your desires."\n\nHaving recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great\nking! Shree Krishnu said to the Raja Joodisthur,--"O Joodisthur! I destroy by\ndegrees all the\n\np. 429\n\nwealth of him, to whom I show favour: because brothers, wives, sons and\nrelations abandon the poor, and then a spirit of devotion springs up in their\nminds; and, from being occupied in religious devotion, they, having abandoned\nthe fascinations of riches and the world, become free from all attachments,\nand worship me with zealous attention, and through the glory of their\nadoration, obtain an everlasting emancipation from matter, and a reunion with\nthe deity." After having thus spoken, Shookdeo Jee added,--O great king! by\nworshipping other gods, the desires of the mind are fulfilled, but final\nsalvation is not obtained.\n\nAfter having related this story, the sage said to Raja Pureechit,--"O great\nking! on one occasion as Bikasoor, the son of Kusyp, came out of his house,\ndesiring to perform penance, he met Narud, the sage, on the road. On seeing\nNarud Jee he made a salutation; and, standing before him with joined hands,\nenquired, with the utmost humility, "O great king! which of the three deities\nBruhmu, Vishnu or Muhadeo grants boons most quickly, do me the kindness to\nsay, in order that I may practice devout austerities in his honour?" Narud Jee\nreplied,--"Listen Bikasoor! amongst these three deities, Muhadeo is the\ngreatest granter of boons, he neither loves delay, nor is he easily angry.\nBehold! Shivu Jee, being delighted at the performance on his part of a slight\npenance, gave a thousand arms to Suhusrajooraun, and destroyed him, being\nenraged at a slight fault he had committed."\n\nNarud, the sage, having thus spoken went away; and Bikasoor began, when he\ncame home, to perform severe penance and offer up sacrifice in honour of\nMuhadeo. In the course of seven days, he cut off with a knife, and offered as\na burnt offering all the flesh of his body; on the eighth day, when he\nresolved to cut off his head, Bholanath came, and having laid hold of his hand\nsaid,--"I have been highly pleased with thee, ask from me\n\np. 430\n\nwhatever boon thou desirest, and I will now grant it to thee." When Shivu Jee\nhad thus spoken, Bikasoor, with joined hands, replied,--"Be pleased, O lord!\nto take compassion upon me, and now grant me this boon, that on whose head\nsoever I may place my hand, he may be reduced to ashes instantaneously." On\nhis uttering these words, Muhadeo Jee granted him the boon he had asked; which\nwhen he had obtained, he went to put his hand upon Shivu\'s head; Muhadeo was\nalarmed, and quitted his seat and fled, and the demon also ran after him, and\ncarried on a close pursuit of Sudashivu. At length Muhadeo went in a state of\nvery great agitation to Vishnu\'s heaven; seeing, that he was greatly\nafflicted, Shree Moorari, the friend of his worshippers, the lord of paradise,\nthe abode of mercy, took compassion upon him, and assuming the appearance of a\nbrahmin went before Bikasoor and said, "O prince of demons! explain to me why\nyou toil in pursuit of Shivu?" On hearing this question, Bikasoor explained\nall that had occurred, then Bhugwan said, "O chief of demons! it is very\nstrange that an intelligent person like you should commit error, who believes\nany thing to be true, which this naked, mad jogee says, who eats bhang and\nthornapple; he constantly dwells in cemeteries, rubbing his body with ashes,\nand having snakes twisted round him; assuming a terrifying appearance, and\naccompanied by ghosts and goblins, who will believe what he says?" Shree\nNarayun proceeded to say, "O chief of demons! if you think that what I have\nsaid is untrue, place your hand on your own head and see."\n\nO great king! on hearing the lord speak thus, when Bikasoor, who was deprived\nof sense through the influence of the delusive power, placed his hand upon his\nown head, he was burnt up, and became a heap of ashes; there were musical\nrejoicings in the capital of Indru on the death of the demon; and the gods,\nraising shouts of victory and exultation, began to\n\np. 431\n\nrain down flowers; the celestial dancers, musicians and choristers celebrated\nin songs the excellent attributes of Huri, who, having at that time, greatly\nglorified Muhadeo, allowed him to take leave, and granted Bikasoor salvation.\n\nShree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great king! whosoever shall hear or recite this\nstory, shall doubtlessly obtain beatitude by the favour of Huri and Muhadeo.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LXXXIX](psa90.htm)\n\n'
