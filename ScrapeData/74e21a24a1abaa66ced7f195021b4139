But this is an attempt to prove something not\nproved by something else that is equally unproved; comparable to a man blind\nfrom birth undertaking to guide another blind man! You have no right to\nmaintain the non-existence of the antecedent non-existence of consciousness on\nthe ground that there is nothing to make us apprehend that non-existence; for\nthere is something to make us apprehend it, viz. consciousness itself!--But\nhow can consciousness at the time when it is, make us apprehend its own\nprevious non-existence which is contradictorily opposed to it?--Consciousness,\nwe rejoin, does not necessarily constitute as its objects only what occupies\nthe same time with itself; were it so it would follow that neither the past\nnor the future can be the object of consciousness. Or do you mean that there\nis an absolute rule that the\n\np. 51\n\nAntecedent non-existence of consciousness, if proved, must be contemporaneous\nwith consciousness? Have you then, we ask, ever observed this so as to be able\nto assert an absolute rule? And if it were observed, that would prove the\nexistence of previous non-existence, not its negation!--The fact, however, is\nthat no person in his senses will maintain the contemporaneous existence of\nconsciousness and its own antecedent non-existence. In the case of perceptive\nknowledge originating from sensation, there is indeed this limitation, that it\ncauses the apprehension of such things only as are actually present at the\nsame time. But this limitation does not extend to cognitions of all kinds, nor\nto all instruments of knowledge; for we observe that remembrance, inference,\nand the magical perception of Yogis apprehend such things also as are not\npresent at the time of apprehension. On this very point there rests the\nrelation connecting the means of knowledge with their objects, viz. that the\nformer are not without the latter. This does not mean that the instrument of\nknowledge is connected with its object in that way that it is not without\nsomething that is present at the time of cognition; but rather that the\ninstrument of knowledge is opposed to the falsehood of that special form in\nwhich the object presents itself as connected with some place and time.--This\ndisposes also of the contention that remembrance has no external object; for\nit is observed that remembrance is related to such things also as have\nperished.--Possibly you will now argue as follows. The antecedent non-\nexistence of consciousness cannot be ascertained by perception, for it is not\nsomething present at the time of perception. It further cannot be ascertained\nby the other means of knowledge, since there is no characteristic mark (linga)\non which an inference could be based: for we do not observe any characteristic\nmark invariably accompanied by the antecedent non-existence of consciousness.\nNor do we meet with any scriptural text referring to this antecedent non-\nexistence. Hence, in the absence of any valid instrument of knowledge, the\nantecedent non-existence of consciousness cannot be established at all.--If,\nwe reply, you thus,\n\np. 52\n\naltogether setting aside the force of self-provedness (on which you had relied\nhitherto), take your stand on the absence of valid means of knowledge, we\nagain must request you to give in; for there is a valid means of knowledge\nwhereby to prove the antecedent non-existence of consciousness, viz. valid\nnon-perception (anupalabdhi).\n\nMoreover, we observe that perceptional knowledge proves its object, be it a\njar or something else, to exist only as long as it exists itself, not at all\ntimes; we do not, through it, apprehend the antecedent or subsequent existence\nof the jar. Now this absence of apprehension is due to the fact that\nconsciousness itself is limited in time. If that consciousness which has a jar\nfor its object were itself apprehended as non-limited in time, the object also\n--the jar--would be apprehended under the same form, i.e. it would be eternal.\nAnd if self-established consciousness were eternal, it would be immediately\ncognised as eternal; but this is not the case. Analogously, if inferential\nconsciousness and other forms of consciousness were apprehended as non-limited\nin time, they would all of them reveal their objects also as non-limited, and\nthese objects would thus be eternal; for the objects are conform in nature to\ntheir respective forms of consciousness.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: There is no consciousness without object](sbe48019.htm)\n\n'
