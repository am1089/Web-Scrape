V.\n\nKings of Mithila. Legend of Nimi, the son of Ikshwaku. Birth of Janaka.\nSacrifice of Siradhwaja. Origin of Sita. Descendants of Ku\xc5\x9badhwaja. Kriti the\nlast of the Maithila princes.\n\nTHE son of Ikshwaku, who was named Nimi 1, instituted a sacrifice that was to\nendure for a thousand years, and applied to Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha to offer the oblations.\nVa\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha in answer said, that he had been preengaged by Indra for five\nhundred years, but that if the Raja, would wait for some time, he would come\nand officiate as superintending priest. The king made no answer, and\nVa\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha went away, supposing that he had assented. When the sage had\ncompleted the performance of the ceremonies he had conducted for Indra, he\nreturned with all speed to Nimi, purposing to render him the like office. When\nhe arrived, however, and found that Nimi had retained Gautama and other\npriests to minister at his sacrifice, he was much displeased, and pronounced\nupon the king, who was then asleep, a curse to this effect, that since he had\nnot intimated his intention, but transferred to Gautama the duty he had first\nentrusted to himself, Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, Nimi should thenceforth cease to exist in a\ncorporeal form. When Nimi woke, and knew what had happened, he in return\ndenounced as an imprecation upon his unjust preceptor, that he also should\nlose his bodily existence, as the punishment of uttering a curse upon him\nwithout previously communicating with him. Nimi then abandoned his bodily\ncondition. The spirit of Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha also leaving his body, was united with the\nspirits of Mitra and Varun\xcc\x81a for a season, until, through their passion for\nthe nymph Urva\xc5\x9bi, the sage was born again in a different shape. The corpse of\nNimi was preserved from decay by being embalmed with fragrant oils and resins,\nand it remained as entire as if it were immortal 2. When the sacrifice\n\np. 389\n\nwas concluded, the priests applied to the gods, who had come to receive their\nportions, that they would confer a blessing upon the author of the sacrifice.\nThe gods were willing to restore him to bodily life, but Nimi declined its\nacceptance, saying, "O deities, who are the alleviators of all worldly\nsuffering, there is not in the world a deeper cause of distress than the\nseparation of soul and body: it is therefore my wish to dwell in the eyes of\nall beings, but never more to resume a corporeal shape!" To this desire the\ngods assented, and Nimi was placed by them in the eyes of all living\ncreatures; in consequence of which their eyelids are ever opening and\nshutting.\n\nAs Nimi left no successor, the Munis, apprehensive of the consequences of the\nearth being without a ruler, agitated the body of the prince, and produced\nfrom it a prince who was called Janaka, from being born without a progenitor.\nIn consequence of his father being without a body (videha), he was termed also\nVaideha, \'the son of the bodiless;\' and the further received the name of\nMithi, from having been produced by agitation (mathana) 3. The son of Janaka\nwas Udavasu;\n\np. 390\n\nhis son was Nandivarddhana; his son was Suketu; his son was Devarata; his son\nwas Vrihaduktha; his son was Mahavirya; his son was Satyadhriti; his son was\nDhrisht\xcc\x81aketu; his son was Haryya\xc5\x9bwa; his son was Maru; his son was\nPratibandhaka; his son was Kritaratha; his son was Krita; his son was Vibudha;\nhis son was Mahadhriti; his son was Kritirata; his son was Maharoman; his son\nwas Suvarn\xcc\x81aroman; his son was Hraswaroman; his son was Siradhwaja.\n\nSiradhwaja ploughing the ground, to prepare it for a sacrifice which he\ninstituted in order to obtain progeny, there sprang up in the furrow a damsel,\nwho became his daughter Sita 4. The brother of Siradhwaja was Ku\xc5\x9badhwaja, who\nwas king of Ka\xc5\x9bi 5; he had a son also, named Bhanumat 6. The son of Bhanumat\nwas Satadyumna; his son was \xc5\x9auchi; his son was \xc3\x9arjjavaha; his son was\n\xc5\x9aatyadhwaja; his son was Kuni 7; his son was Anjana; his son was Ritujit; his\nson was Arisht\xcc\x81anemi 8; his son was \xc5\x9arutayus; his son was Supar\xc5\x9bwa; his son\nwas Sanjaya 9; his son was Kshemari 10; his son was Anenas 11; his son was\nMinaratha 12; his son was Satyaratha; his son was Satyarathi 13; his son was\nUpagu 14; his son was \xc5\x9aruta 15; his son was Saswata 16; his son was Sudhanwan;\nhis son was Subhasa; his son was Su\xc5\x9bruta 17; his son was Jaya; his son was\nVijaya; his son was Rita; his son was Sunaya 18; his son was Vitahavya;\n\np. 391\n\nhis son was Dhriti; his son was Bahula\xc5\x9bwa; his son was Kriti, with whom\nterminated the family of Janaka. These are the kings of Mithila, who for the\nmost part will be 19 proficient in spiritual knowledge 20.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[388:1](vp097.htm#fr_1020) None of the authorities, except the Vayu and\nBhagavata, contain the series of kings noticed in this chapter.\n\n[388:2](vp097.htm#fr_1021) This shews that the Hindus were not unacquainted\nwith the Egyptian art of embalming dead bodies. In the Ka\xc5\x9bi Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, s. 30,\nan account is given of a Brahman who carries his mother\'s bones, p. 389 or\nrather her corpse, from Setuhandha or Rame\xc5\x9bwara to Ka\xc5\x9bi. For this purpose he\nfirst washes it with the five excretions of a cow, and the five pure fluids,\nor milk, curds, ghee, honey, and sugar. He then embalms it with\nYakshakarddama, a composition of Agallochum, camphor, musk, saffron, sandal,\nand a resin called Kakkola; and envelopes it severally with Netra vastra,\nflowered muslin; Pat\xcc\x81t\xcc\x81amvara, silk; Surasa vastra, coarse cotton;\nManjisht\xcc\x81ha, cloth dyed with madder; and Nepala Kambala, nepal blanketing. He\nthen covers it with pure clay, and puts the whole into a coffin of copper,\nTamra samput\xcc\x81a. These practices are not only unknown, but would be thought\nimpure in the present day.\n\n[389:3](vp097.htm#fr_1022) These legends are intended to explain, and were\nprobably suggested by, the terms Vaideha and Mithila, applied to the country\nupon the Gandak and Kai rivers, the modern Tirhut. The Ramayan\xcc\x81a places a\nprince named Mithi between Nimi and Janaka, whence comes the name Mithila. In\nother respects the list of kings of Mithila agrees, except in a few names.\nJanaka the successor of Nimi is different from Janaka who is celebrated as the\nfather of Sita. One of them, which, does not appear, is also renowned as a\nphilosopher, and patron of philosophical teachers. Mahabharata, Moksha Dharma.\nAccording to the Vayu P., Nimi founded a city called Jayantapur, near the\n\xc3\x81\xc5\x9brama of Gautama. The remains of a city called Janakpur, on the northern\nskirts of the district, are supposed to indicate the site of a city founded by\none of the princes so named.\n\n[390:4](vp097.htm#fr_1023) This identifies Siradhwaja with the second Janaka,\nthe father-in-law of Rama. The story of Sita\'s birth, or rather discovery, is\nnarrated in the Aranya Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a of the Ramayan\xcc\x81a, the Vana Parva of the\nMahabharata, and in the Vayu, Brahma Vaivartta, Kalika, and other Puran\xcc\x81as.\n\n[390:5](vp097.htm#fr_1024) The Ramayan\xcc\x81a says, \'of Sanka\xc5\x9bya,\' which is no\ndoubt the correct reading. Fa Hian found the kingdom of Sang-kia-shi in the\nDoab, about Mainpuri. Account of the Foe-kue-ki. The Bhagavata makes\nKu\xc5\x9badhwaja the son of Siradwaja.\n\n[390:6](vp097.htm#fr_1025) The Bhagavata differs from our authority here\nconsiderably, by inserting several princes between Kusadhwaja and Bhanumat;\nor, Dharmadhwaja, who has two sons, Kritadhwaja and Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikya; the former is\nthe father of Ke\xc5\x9bidhwaja, the latter of Bhanumat. See the last book of the\nVishn\xcc\x81u.\n\n[390:7](vp097.htm#fr_1026) \xc5\x9aakuni, and the last of the series, according to\nthe Vayu,\n\n[390:8](vp097.htm#fr_1027) Between this prince and \xc5\x9auchi the series of the\nBhagavata is Sanadhwaja, Urddhwaketu, Aja, Purujit. The following variations\nare from the same authority.\n\n[390:9](vp097.htm#fr_1028) Chitraratha.\n\n[390:10](vp097.htm#fr_1029) Kshemadhi.\n\n[390:11](vp097.htm#fr_1030) Omitted.\n\n[390:12](vp097.htm#fr_1031) Samaratha.\n\n[390:13](vp097.htm#fr_1032) Omitted.\n\n[390:14](vp097.htm#fr_1033) Upaguru.\n\n[390:15](vp097.htm#fr_1034) Upagupta.\n\n[390:16](vp097.htm#fr_1035) Vaswananta.\n\n[390:17](vp097.htm#fr_1036) Yuyudhana, Subhashan\xcc\x81a, \xc5\x9aruta.\n\n[390:18](vp097.htm#fr_1037) \xc5\x9aunaka.\n\n[391:19](vp097.htm#fr_1038) ### is the reading of all the copies; but why the\nfuture verb, \'will be,\' is used does not appear.\n\n[391:20](vp097.htm#fr_1039) Descendants of two of the other sons of the Manu\nare noticed in the Bhagavata; from Nriga, it is said, proceeded Sumati,\nBhutajyotish, Vasu, Pratika, Oghavat, and his sister Oghavati, married to\nSudar\xc5\x9bana. The Linga gives three sons to Nriga, Vrisha, Dhrisht\xcc\x81aka, and\nRan\xcc\x81adhrisht\xcc\x81a, and alludes to a legend of his having been changed to a lizard\nby the curse of a Brahman. Narishyanta\'s descendants were Chitrasena, Daksha,\nMadhwat, Purva, Indrasena, Vitihotra, Satya\xc5\x9brava, Uru\xc5\x9bravas, Devadatta,\nAgnive\xc5\x9bya, also called Jatukarn\xcc\x81a, a form of Agni, and progenitor of the\n\xc3\x81gnive\xc5\x9bya Brahmans. In the Brahma P. and Hari V. the sons of Narishyat, whom\nthe commentator on the latter considers as the same with Narishyanta, are\ntermed Sacas, Sacae or Scythians; whilst, again, it is said that the son of\nNarishyanta was Dama, or, as differently read, Yams. As this latter\naffiliation is stated in the authorities, it would appear as if this\nNarishyanta was one of the sons of the Manu; but this is only a proof of the\ncarelessness of the compilation, for in the Vishn\xcc\x81u, Vayu, and Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya\nPuran\xcc\x81as, Narishyanta, the father of Dama, is the son of Marutta, the\nfourteenth of the posterity of Disht\xcc\x81a or Nedisht\xcc\x81a.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter IV](vp098.htm)\n\n'
