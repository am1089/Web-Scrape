Pra _g_ apati poured forth the life-sap of the horse (a _s_ va-\nmedha); when poured forth it went from him. Having become fivefold 2 it\nentered the year, and they (the five parts) became those half-months 3. He\nfollowed it up by means of the fifteenfold (sets of victims 4), and found it;\nand having found it, he took possession of it by means of the fifteenfold\nones; for, indeed, they--to wit, the fifteenfold (sets)--are a symbol of the\nhalf-months, and when he seizes the fifteenfold ones, it is the\n\np. 309\n\nhalf-months the Sacrificer thereby takes possession of.\n\n13:2:5:22\\. Concerning this they say, 'But, surely, the year is not taken\npossession of by him who spreads out (performs sacrifice for) a year in any\nother way than by means of the Seasonal sacrifices 1.' The Seasonal\nsacrifices, doubtless, are manifestly the year; and when he seizes the\nSeasonal victims 2, he then manifestly takes possession of the year. 'And,\nassuredly, he who spreads out the year in any other way than with the\n(victims) of the set of eleven 3 (stakes) is deprived of his offspring (or\n\np. 310\n\nsubjects) and cattle, and fails to reach heaven. This set of eleven (stakes),\nindeed, is just heaven 1, and the set of eleven (stakes) means offspring (or\npeople) and cattle and when he lays hands on the (victims) of the (two) sets\nof eleven (stakes) he does not fail to reach heaven, and is not deprived of\nhis offspring and cattle.\n\n13:2:5:33\\. Pra _g_ apati created the Vira _g_ ; when created, it went away\nfrom him, and entered the horse meet for sacrifice. He followed it up with\nsets of ten 2\n\np. 311\n\n[paragraph continues] (beasts). He found it, and, having found it, he took\npossession of it by means of the sets of ten: when he seizes the sets of\neleven (beasts), the Sacrificer thereby takes possession . of the Vira _g_. He\nseizes a hundred, for man has a life of a hundred (years) and a hundred\nenergies: vital power and energy, vigour, he thus takes to himself.\n\n13:2:5:44\\. Eleven decades 1 he seizes, for the Trish _t_ ubh consists of\neleven syllables, and the Trish _t_ ubh means energy, vigour: thus it is for\nthe obtainment of energy, vigour. Eleven decades he seizes, for in an animal\nthere are ten vital airs, and the body: (trunk) is the eleventh: he thus\nsupplies the animals with vital airs. They belong to all the gods for the\ncompleteness of the horse (sacrifice), for the horse belongs to all the gods.\nThey are of many forms, whence beasts are of many forms; they are of distinct\nforms, whence beasts are of distinct forms.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[308:2](sbe44087.htm#fr_787) Or the Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti metre, consisting of five\noctosyllabic padas.\n\n[308:3](sbe44087.htm#fr_788) Viz. as consisting of thrice five days.\n\n[308:4](sbe44087.htm#fr_789) See above, [XIII, 2, 2,\n11](sbe44084.htm#13:2:2:11).\n\n[309:1](sbe44087.htm#fr_790) On this point, cp. II, 6, 3, 1.--'Verily,\nimperishable is the righteousness of him who offers the Seasonal sacrifices;\nfor such a one gains the year, and hence there is no cessation for him. He\ngains it in three divisions, he conquers it in three divisions. The year means\nthe whole, and the whole is imperishable (without end). Moreover, he thereby\nbecomes a Season, and as such goes to the gods; but there is no perishableness\nin the gods, and hence there is imperishable righteousness for him.'\n\n[309:2](sbe44087.htm#fr_791) The _K_ aturmasyas are the victims enumerated Va\n_g_. S. XXIV, 14-19. The first six of them are the last (of the set of\nfifteen) bound to the thirteenth stake; whilst the remaining victims make up\nall the seven sets of fifteen victims bound to remaining stakes (14-21)--thus\namounting to 121 domesticated animals, cf. [XIII, 5, 1,\n13](sbe44106.htm#13:5:1:13), seq. In counting the stakes the central one is\nthe first, then follows the one immediately south, and then the one\nimmediately north of it, and thus alternately south and north. The reason why\nthe name ' _K_ aturmasya' is applied to the victims here referred to is that\nthe deities for whose benefit they are immolated are the same, and follow the\nsame order, as those to whom (the chief) oblations are made at the Seasonal\nsacrifices (viz. the constant ones--Agni, Soma, Savit _ri_ , Sarasvati,\nPushan, and special ones, see II, 5, 1, 8-17; 5, 2, 7-16; 5, 3, 2-4; 5. 4,\n2-10; 6, 1, 4-6; 6, 2, 9; 6, 3, 4-8).\n\n[309:3](sbe44087.htm#fr_792) That is to say, he who seeks to gain the year by\nimmolating only the Seasonal victims, and the sets of fifteen victims, and\ndoes not offer likewise the victims of the set (or rather two sets) of eleven\np. 310 stakes. These two sets of eleven victims, tied to the twenty-one stakes\n(two being tied to the central stake), are to constitute the regular 'savaniya\n_h_ pa _s_ ava _h_ ' of the pressing-days of the A _s_ vamedha; and in [XIII,\n5, 1, 3](sbe44106.htm#13:5:1:3), and [5, 3, 11](sbe44108.htm#13:5:3:11), the\nauthor argues against those who (on the first, and third days) would immolate\nonly twenty-one such victims, all of them sacred to Agni. As regards the\nsecond day, the author does not mention these particular victims, but this an\nscarcely be interpreted as an approval of twenty-one such victims, even though\nthe number twenty-one certainly plays an important part on that day--seeing\nthat Katyayana, XX, 4, 25, makes the two sets of eleven victims the rule for\nall three days. For the third day, on the other hand, the author of the Brahma\n_n_ a ([XIII, 5, 3, 11](sbe44108.htm#13:5:3:11)) actually recommends the\nimmolation of twenty-four bovine victims as 'savaniya _h_ pa _s_ ava _h_.' The\ndeities of the first set of eleven victims (as perhaps also of the second set\nof the first day) are the same as those of the ordinary 'ekada _s_ ini' (see\nIII, 9, 1, 62 1; and Va _g_. S. XXIX, 58), whilst the second set (of the\nsecond day, at all events) has different deities (Va _g_. S. XXIX, 60). On the\ncentral day these victims are added to the sets of fifteen victims bound there\nto each of the twenty-one stakes; the mode of distribution being the same as\non the other two days, viz., so that the first victim of each set--that is the\none devoted to Agni--is bound to the central stake, whilst of the remaining\ntwenty victims one is assigned to each stake.\n\n[310:1](sbe44087.htm#fr_793) Viz. inasmuch as the stakes stand right in front\n(to the east) of the sacrificial fire and ground, and the Sacrificer would\nthus miss the way to heaven if he were not to pass through the 'ekada _s_\nini.'\n\n[310:2](sbe44087.htm#fr_794) The Vira _g_ metre consists of (three)\ndecasyllabic padas.\n\n[311:1](sbe44087.htm#fr_795) After the (349) domesticated animals have been\nsecured to the stakes, sets of thirteen wild beasts are placed on the (twenty)\nspaces between the (twenty-one) stakes, making in all 260 wild beasts. From\nthe 150th beast onward (enumerated Va _g_. S. XXIV, 30-40) these amount to 111\nbeasts which here are called eleven decades; the odd beast not being taken\ninto account, whilst in [paragraph 3](sbe44087.htm#13:2:5:3) above the first\nten decades are singled out for symbolic reasons. These beasts are spread ever\nthe twelfth (only the last seven Beasts of which belong to the first decade)\nand following spaces.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 2, 6. Sixth Brahma _n_ a](sbe44088.htm)\n\n"
