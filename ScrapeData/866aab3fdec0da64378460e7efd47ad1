How have existence and light come to be conjoined with all existing\nthings?\n\np. 54\n\n[paragraph continues] Thus questioning on the analogy of mirror and\nreflection, the disciple is enlightened (by the third stanza of the Hymn).\n\nIt has been said above that _being_ and _light_ manifested in objects do not\ninhere in the objects themselves, and that they are the attributes of the\nperceiver. Then the following question arises: If they do not inhere in the\nobjects perceived, how is it that they are perceived in connection with them?\nIt cannot be that they are manifested in objects, either by way of being\nreflected in them as in a mirror, or by way of actually conjoining with them\nas fire conjoins with a mass of iron; for existence and consciousness which\nare formless in themselves are incapable of being reflected in the objects or\nof conjoining with them.\n\nThe meaning of the stanza may be explained as follows:\n\n#### Absolute unity of Atman.\n\n2\\. The existence and light in all phenomenal things, which are insentient,\nmomentary and almost non-existent, proceed from the eternal Isvara and become\nconjoined with them.\n\np. 55\n\n3\\. These things have their being in the being of Atman, and no more; and so\nalso, the light by which they shine is the light of Atman and no more.\n\nThe questioner\'s standpoint may be either that the phenomenal things exist\nquite apart from Atman like the mirror existing apart from the objects which\nare reflected in it; or that they exist independently of Atman and shine by a\nlight of their own, so that they do not depend on Atman for their existence\nand light. In the first case the Teacher answers as follows: The phenomena\nhave no separate existence; they are unreal because they are inert and\nmomentary, like the illusory serpent,--where a rope is mistaken for a serpent.\nAtman alone exists and appears as the things which we perceive, like a rope\nappearing to be a serpent. When we speak of the existence and light of Atman\nas conjoining with the phenomenal things, we mean only that Atman puts on the\nappearance of these phenomenal things. If these things could exist separately\nand shine by themselves, then they would have appeared independently of Atman,\nlike the mirror appearing independently of the objects reflected in it. The\n\np. 56\n\nphenomenal things having thus no separate existence from that of Atman, we\ncannot speak of the existence and light of Atman either as being _actually_\nreflected in them or as _actually_ conjoining with them.\n\nIf the question had been asked from the second standpoint of view, it may be\nanswered as follows:\n\n4\\. The manifold cognitions and their objects also are fast bound to the Ego,\nas pearls are strung on a thread.\n\nThe existence of phenomena and the light by which they shine pertain to the\nEgo, the self-conscious Existence, and reach them through the antah-karana\nwith which the Ego identifies himself.\n\nThe two standpoints from which the question has been answered in the two\ndifferent cases differ only in this respect: in the first case the answer has\nbeen given from the standpoint of Absolute Reality, and in the second case,\nfrom the standpoint of things regarded as phenomenally real.\n\np. 57\n\n5\\. To every living being this universe appears as quite inseparate from the\nLight. Billows and bubbles have no existence apart from water.\n\nWhatever depends on something else for its existence and manifestation is only\nan imaginary form of that other thing, like the billows and bubbles which are\nonly imaginary forms of water. Accordingly the phenomenal things which depend\nfor their existence and light on the self-conscious Atman are only imaginary\nforms of Atman. Atman alone exists, one without a second.\n\n6\\. The very consciousness which, first entering into phenomenal things,\nexpresses itself in the words \'I know,\' then returns to rest in the Self\nwithin, expressing itself in the words \'It is known by me.\'\n\nIt is true that the object of cognition is present in both the expressions of\nconsciousness. In the first, however, the mere act of cognising the object is\nalone intended, while the second conveys the idea that that act is conceived\nto inhere in the Ego.\n\np. 58\n\n7\\. All products such as pots rest in (their causes) such as clay. (So) the\nuniverse, as one with the Light, must rest in the Supreme Lord.\n\nAn effect does not exist apart from its cause. A pot, for example, does not\nexist apart from clay, its material cause. Likewise, the universe whose\nmaterial cause is Atman is one with Atman and has no independent existence.\nAtman alone really exists, the universe being a mere illusory appearance\nthereof.\n\nWhile in vartika 6 it has been shown that the Light by which the phenomenal\nthings shine is no other than the light of Atman, the vartika 7 shows that the\nthings themselves have no existence independent of Atman\'s existence.\n\n#### Avidya the cause of delusion.\n\n8\\. Just as the mirror is dimmed by a stain attaching to it, so knowledge is\nveiled by avidya, and thereby creatures are deluded.\n\np. 59\n\nAll creatures are deluded alto the real nature of Atman by avidya which leads\nthem to look upon as real all distinctions in the phenomenal world such as\nperceiver and objects perceived, cause and effect, and so on.\n\n#### The body separates Jiva from Isvara.\n\n9\\. As the akasa within a jar is marked off from the infinite (Maha) akasa by\nthe upadhi of the jar, so is the distinction between Jivatman and Paramatman\ncaused by the upadhi of the body.\n\nLike akasa, Atman is indivisible. All distinctions ascribed to Atman are due\nto the distinctions pertaining to the bodies. It is hard to make out any real\nconnection between Atman and the bodies, so that all limitations ascribed to\nAtman are false and imaginary.\n\n#### Their unity taught in the Sruti "That thou art."\n\n10\\. By scriptural texts, such as "That thou art," their unity is indeed\ntaught.\n\np. 60\n\n[paragraph continues] On saying, for instance, "He is this person," one man\nalone is referred to.\n\n11\\. The world \'that\' denotes the Principle which is the cause of the\nuniverse; while Jiva limited by the body, etc., is denoted by the word \'thou.\'\n\nThe word \'that\' denotes Isvara, the self-conscious Atman, regarded by the\nIndividual Ego as external to himself, embodied in the universe as a whole\nwhich has been evolved out of ajnana, otherwise called Maya whose\ncharacteristic function consists in _vikshepa_ , in projecting the Self in the\nform of the external universe. The word \'thou\' refers to Jiva, the self-\nconscious personal Ego,, the same self-conscious Atman viewed in association\nwith the physical and subtle-- _sthula_ and _sukshma_ --bodies born of ajnana,\notherwise called avidya, whose characteristic function consists in _avarana_ ,\nin veiling the true nature of the Self.\n\nIn the sentence "he is this (person),"\n\np. 61\n\n12\\. A person seen at a former time and place and under the then state, etc.,\nis spoken of as \'he\'; and the same person seen now and here is spoken of as\n\'this.\'\n\n13-14\\. Just as the sentence "He is this person" points to an identical man,\nwhile the specific circumstances referred to by \'he\' and \'this\' are lost sight\nof, so, losing sight of inwardness and outwardness, the passage "That thou\nart" points to the identity of _Jiv atman_ and _Param atman_.\n\nAs absolute Consciousness they are identical.\n\n15\\. Here the two words--\'that\' and \'thou \'--bear to each other the relation\nof _apposition_ ( _s amanadhi-karanya_); and the things denoted by them are\nsaid to bear\n\np. 62\n\nan _attributive_ relation ( _viseshana-viseshya-bh ava_) to each other.\n\n16\\. The sentence as a whole teaches identity, the words being understood in a\nsecondary sense ( _lakshana_ ).\n\nWhen two words in a sentence are put in apposition to each other, we are to\nunderstand that the things denoted by them can be predicated of each other.\nBut the Isvara and Jiva, primarily denoted by the words \'that\' and \'thou,\' are\nso opposed to each other that neither can be predicated of the other. The\nunity of Jive, and Isvara taught in the Sruti is possible only when from each\nof them are eliminated such of the attributes as are opposed to those of the\nother, _i.e._ , when we discard the primary sense of the words and understand\nthem in a secondary sense.\n\nThe secondary sense of a word may either include or exclude the primary sense;\nor it may even include one part of the primary sense and exclude the other\npart. In the sentence \'That thou art.\'\n\np. 63\n\n16-17\\. The secondary sense is not altogether exclusive of the primary sense,\nunlike that in the expression "a village on the Ganges"; nor is it altogether\ninclusive of the primary sense, unlike that in the expression "A white (\n_i.e._ , a white horse) runs."\n\n17-18\\. The secondary sense of sentences like "That thou art" is partial,--\npartially inclusive and partially exclusive of the primary sense,--like that\nof the sentence "He is this person," and the like.\n\nIn the above, the word \'Ganges \' which primarily means the stream has to be\nunderstood in the sense of \'the bank of the Ganges,\' so that the whole of the\nprimary sense is excluded. The word \'white\' which primarily means \'white\ncolour\' has to be understood in the sense of \'a white horse,\' so that the\nwhole of the primary sense is included in the secondary. On the other hand,\n\'that\' and \'thou\' cannot be understood in either of the two ways. The primary\nsense of the word cannot be wholly lost sight of, since, then, there will be\nleft\n\np. 64\n\nnothing of which unity can be predicated. Neither can it be wholly included,\ninasmuch as the mutual opposition between Jiva and Isvara will render it\nimpossible to predicate a unity of them. When we eliminate from the primary\nsense of each word all that is alien to sentiency, which is common to both\nIsvara and Jiva, consciousness alone will be left; and thus the sentence \'That\nthou art\' teaches the identity of Jiva and Isvara as the one indivisible,\ncolourless, Absolute Consciousness.\n\n18-19\\. The relation of apposition here (in vartika 15) spoken of consists in\nwords of different origin referring all to one and the same thing.\n\n#### The Sruti points to no sort of distinction between Jiva and Isvara.\n\n1g-21. The sentence cannot mean that Jiva is either a _part_ or a\n_modification_ of the\n\np. 65\n\n[paragraph continues] Supreme, since, in the form of Jiva, He (Isvara) Himself\nhas entered into the forms created by His own Maya. By Sruti as well as reason\nwe are given to understand that He is partless and changeless, just as akasa\nin the jar is neither a part nor a modification of the infinite akasa.\n\nThe course of reasoning here referred to may be explained as follows: If\nIsvara, the First Cause, the Author of the Universe, were Himself made up of\nparts, He would have been preceded by those parts of which He was made. He\nwould fall under the category of effects, and, as such, cannot constitute the\nOmniscient and Omnipotent Creator of the whole universe. Moreover, as an\neffect made of parts, He would have had a Creator preceding Him, and that\nother Creator would have had another preceding Him, and so on.\n\n21\\. It cannot indeed mean mere _praise_ , as does the sentence "thou art\nIndra."\n\nWhen he who is not Indra is addressed as such, it is nothing hut a mere\npraise. The passage "That thou art" does not mean mere praise, because it\noccurs in a section which, interpreted\n\np. 66\n\naccording to recognised principles of construction, points to nothing but\nabsolute unity of Isvara and Jiva, and leaves no room for the alleged\ninterpretation.\n\n22\\. The passage cannot point to mere _similarity_ , as the sentences like\n"The disciple is fire."\n\nNor does it signify a relation of _cause and effect_ as does the sentence, "A\npot is (mere) clay."\n\n"The disciple is fire" means that the disciple is as pure as fire itself, and\nthus points to a similarity between the disciple and fire as regards purity.\nSimilarity consists in one thing possessing some parts or attributes in common\nwith another. Isvara being devoid of parts and attributes, He cannot be spoken\nof as similar to Jiva.\n\nAs devoid of parts, Isvara cannot be spoken of as actually giving rise to\neffects according to any of the theories of creation.\n\n23 The sentence does not point to\n\np. 67\n\na relation as _genus and individual_ , as does the sentence "This lame\n(animal) is a Cow."\n\nThe sentences does not refer to a relation of _substance and attributes_ , as\ndoes the phrase "the blue lotus."\n\nThe genus being regarded as insentient in itself, the sentient Isvara cannot\nbe a genus.\n\nIf Jiva be an attribute of Isvara, then the latter would be a samsarin, of\nlimited knowledge and power, subject to happiness and misery; which is opposed\nto the Sruti declaring that He is omniscient, etc. If, on the other hand,\nIsvara be an attribute of Jiva, then the Jiva would not be a samsarin; and all\nteaching as to bondage and liberation would be of no purpose.\n\n24\\. Nor does the sentence point to mere _contemplative worship_ , like the\ncontemplating of idols as God.\n\nNor does the sentence imply mere _courtesy_ as when a king\'s servant is\naddressed as king (by courtesy.)\n\np. 68\n\nThe sentence "That thou art," does not enjoin the contemplating of Jiva as\nIsvara or vice versa, because there is no word or particle in the passage\nwarranting such an interpretation. On the other hand, the word \'art\' occurring\nin the passage signifies, not a command in the imperative, but a law of\nnature, a matter of fact.\n\nIf it were only by courtesy that Jiva is spoken of as one with Isvara, then\nthere would be no occasion to emphasise the statement as is done in the\nUpanishad ( _Vide_ Chhandogya-Upanishad, 6) by way of reiterating it in nine\ndifferent sections treating of the subject from as many standpoints. A\nstatement made for courtesy\'s sake cannot bear emphasis by reiteration.\n\nThe reason why the sentence can be interpreted in none of the foregoing\nalternative ways is stated as follows:\n\n25\\. For, Isvara is declared in the Sruti to have Himself entered into the\nuniverse as Jiva.\n\nWherefore the sentence \'that thou art\' signifies that the Ego, regarded as\nJiva only when viewed in relation to an upadhi, is in fact identical with\nBrahman.\n\np. 69\n\n#### Atman identified with the body, etc, by ignorance.\n\n25-26\\. When Atman becomes blended with the aggregate composed of Deha (body),\nIndriyas (sense-organs), Manas (mind), Buddhi (intellect), Prana (vitality),\nand Ahankara (egoism), the aggregate itself is regarded by the ignorant as the\nAtman, just as a piece of wood or a metallic mass blending with fire is\nregarded as the fire itself.\n\n#### Atman\'s manifestation in the five Kos\'as.\n\nNow, by way of distinguishing the essential nature from the accidental aspects\nof Jiva and Isvara, the Vartikakara proceeds to show that the teaching of\nSruti as to their identity is founded on fact:\n\n27\\. Entering the _Annamaya-kosa_ , the\n\np. 70\n\nphysical body, Atman becomes self-conscious as stout, youthful, lean, dark, as\nbelonging to a distinct caste and a religious order.\n\n28\\. And in the _Pr ana-kosa_, in the vital body, He feels thus: I am alive, I\nfeel hungry, and thirsty. In the _Manomaya-kosa_ , in the body of thought,\nAtman feels: I doubt, I feel sure, I think.\n\n29-30\\. Entering the _Vijn anamaya-kosa_, He dwells in the consciousness "I\nunderstand." And in the Ahankara, the Ego, called _Anandamaya-kosa_ , the body\nof bliss, in virtue of His former good deeds and ways of devotion He joys in\nthe consciousness "I am happy."\n\np. 71\n\n30-31\\. Thus garmented with the five kosas (sheaths), with five coats as it\nwere, the Paramesvara, the Supreme Lord, though all-pervading, appears as\nthough He were limited by them.\n\n31-32\\. As the sun, entering water, appear as many, so, entering the bodies,\ndoes Isvara appear as many.\n\n#### Jiva and Isvara one in essence.\n\n32-33\\. To speak of them as the cause and the effect is to define them by\ntheir accidental attributes, like defining the moon as being on the branch of\na tree. Never is this deemed an essential definition.\n\n33-34\\. The essential definition of the moon consists in speaking of it as a\ngreat\n\np. 72\n\nluminary. So the essential definition of Isvara and Jiva consists in\ndescribing them as _Sat-chit- ananda_, as Existence, Consciousness and Bliss.\n\n34-35\\. Unity of the two beings as one in their essential nature is taught by\nthe scriptural text "That thou art." Hence the truth that the One Light is the\nSelf in all.\n\n35-36\\. Devas, animals and men have no existence apart from the Light. As one\nwith the Light, Jiva is designated the Sarvatman, the Self in all.\n\n#### Realization of Atman\'s unity leads to Liberation.\n\n36-37\\. When this conviction of being one with the Light is steadied, one\nattains\n\np. 73\n\nto _Kaivalya_ , to the state of Liberation, from which there is no more\nreturn.\n\n37-33\\. Even he, who by chance but once cherishes the notion that he is the\nSelf in all, is freed from all sins, is adored in Siva-loka, adored as Siva\nHimself.\n\n38-39\\. That Mahatman, that mighty-souled Being whose contemplation of the one\nSelf in all has been perfected, He is the very Deliverer (of all) from\nsamsara, He is the Supreme Lord Himself.\n\n39-40\\. Thus ends the third chapter, in brief, of the work called Manasollasa\nwhich expounds the meaning of the Hymn to the Blessed Dakshinamurti.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter IV.
