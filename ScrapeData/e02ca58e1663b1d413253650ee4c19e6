Because the matter (of certain mantras) such as piercing and so on is\ndifferent (from the matter of the approximate vidyas) (the former have not to\nbe combined with the latter).\n\nAt the beginning of an Upanishad of the \xc3\x82tharva _n_ ikas the following mantra\nis recorded, 'Pierce him (the enemy) whole, pierce his heart: crush his veins,\ncrush his head; thrice crushed,' &c. At the beginning of the Upanishad of the\nTa _n_ _d_ ins we have the mantra, 'O God Savitar, produce the sacrifice.' At\nthe beginning of that of the Sa _t_ yayanins, 'Thou hast a white horse and art\ngreen as grass,' &c.; at the beginning of that of the Ka _th_ as and the\nTaittiriyakas, 'May Mitra be propitious to us and Varu _n_ a,' &c. At the\nbeginning of the Upanishad of the Va _g_ asaneyins we have a Brahma _n_\na-passage about the pravargya-ceremony, 'The gods indeed sat down to a\nsattra;' and at the beginning of that of the Kaushitakins there is a Brahma\n_n_ a-passage about the agnish _t_ oma, 'Brahman indeed is the Agnish _t_ oma,\nBrahman is that day; through Brahman they pass into\n\np. 223\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahman, immortality those reach who observe that day.'\n--The point to be inquired into with reference to all these mantras and the\nsacrifices referred to in the Brahma _n_ a-passages is whether they are to be\ncombined with the vidyas (contained in the Upanishads) or not.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that they are so to be combined, because the text\nexhibits them in proximity to the Upanishad-portions of the Brahma _n_ as\nwhose chief contents are formed by the vidyas.--But we do not observe those\nmantras and sacrifices to be actually enjoined as subordinate members of the\nvidyas!--True, but in spite of this we, on the ground of proximity, infer them\nto be connected with the vidyas. For we have no right to set aside the fact of\nproximity as irrelevant as long as an inference can be established on it.--But\nwe are unable to see that the mantras have anything to do with the vidyas, and\nhow can it be assumed that ceremonies, such as the pravargya which scripture\nenjoins with reference to other occasions, sacrifices, and so on, stand in any\nrelation to the vidyas!--Never mind, the purvapakshin replies. In the case of\nmantras we can always imagine some meaning which connects them with the\nvidyas; the first mantra quoted, e.g. may be viewed as glorifying the heart.\nFor the heart and other parts of the body are often represented, in the\nvidyas, as abodes of meditation, and hence mantras glorifying the heart, &c.,\nmay appropriately form subordinate members of those vidyas. Some mantras,\nmoreover, we clearly see to be enjoined with reference to vidyas, so, e.g. the\nmantra, 'I turn to Bhu _h_ with such and such' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 15, 3).\nSacrificial acts again may indeed be enjoined in connexion with other\noccasions; yet there is no reason why they should not also be applied to the\nvidyas, just as the offering called B _ri_ haspatisava is a subordinate part\nof the Va _g_ apeya-sacrifice 1.\n\nTo this we make the following reply. The mantras and\n\np. 224\n\nceremonies mentioned cannot be drawn into connexion with the vidyas, 'because\ntheir matter, such as piercing the heart, &c., is different (from the matter\nof the vidyas),' and therefore cannot be connected with the latter.--But has\nit not been said above that the mantras may be connected with the meditations\nenjoined in the vidyas, on the ground of their coming of use in meditations on\nthe heart, &c.?--The mantras, we reply, might be so employed, if their entire\ncontents were glorification of the heart, and the like; but this is by no\nmeans the case. The mantra first quoted, e.g. clearly expresses hostility to\nsomebody, and is therefore to be connected, not with the vidyas of the\nUpanishads, but with some ceremony meant to hurt an enemy. The mantra of the\nTa _n_ _d_ ins again, 'O God Savitar, produce the sacrifice,' indicates by its\nvery words that it is connected with some sacrifice; with what particular\nsacrifice it is connected has to be established by other means of proof.\nSimilarly other mantras also--which, either by 'indication' (li\xe1\xb9\x85ga), or\n'syntactical connexion' (vakya), or some other means of proof, are shown to be\nsubordinate to certain sacrificial actions--cannot, because they occur in the\nUpanishads also, be connected with the vidyas on the ground of mere proximity.\nFor that 'proximity,' as a means of proof regarding the connexion of\nsubordinate matters with principal matters, is weaker than direct enunciation\n( _S_ ruti), and so on, is demonstrated in the former science (i.e. in the\nPurva Mima _m_ sa) under III, 3, 14. Of sacrificial works also, such as the\npravargya, which are primarily enjoined with reference to other occasions, it\ncannot be demonstrated that they are supplementary to vidyas with which they\nhave nothing in common. The case of the B _ri_ haspatisava, quoted by the\npurvapakshin, is of an altogether different kind, as there we have an\ninjunction clearly showing that that oblation is a subordinate member of the\nVa _g_ apeya, viz. 'Having offered the Va _g_ apeya he offers the B _ri_\nhaspatisava.' And, moreover, if the one pravargya-ceremony has once been\nenjoined for a definite purpose by a means of proof of superior strength, we\nmust not, on the strength of an inferior means of proof, assume\n\np. 225\n\nit to be enjoined for some different purpose. A proceeding of that kind would\nbe possible only if the difference of the means of proof were not apprehended;\nbut in our case this latter possibility is excluded since the relative\nstrength and weakness of the various means of proof is fully apprehended (on\nthe ground of the conclusions arrived at in the Purva Mima _m_ sa).--For these\nreasons the mentioned mantras and acts are not, on the ground of mere textual\ncollocation, to be viewed as supplementary to the vidyas of the Upanishads. To\naccount for the fact of their textual collocation with the latter we must keep\nin view that the mantras, &c. as well as the vidyas have to be studied, &c. in\nthe woods.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[223:1](sbe38168.htm#fr_146) The B _ri_ haspatisava, although enjoined with\nspecial reference to him who is desirous of Brahmavar _k_ as, is yet at the\nsame time a subordinate part of the Va _g_ apeya-sacrifice.
