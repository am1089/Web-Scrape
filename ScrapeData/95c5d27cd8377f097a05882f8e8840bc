"What is all this for?"\n\nI had got to know Panchu through my master. He was extremely poor, nor was I\nin a position to do anything for him; so I supposed this present was intended\nto procure a tip to help the poor fellow to make both ends meet. I took some\nmoney from my purse and held it out towards him, but with folded hands he\nprotested: "I cannot take that, sir!"\n\n"Why, what is the matter?"\n\n"Let me make a clean breast of it, sir. Once, when I was hard pressed, I stole\nsome cocoa-nuts from the garden here. I am getting old, and may die any day,\nso I have come to pay them back."\n\nAmiel\'s Journal could not have done me any good that day. But these words of\nPanchu lightened my heart. There are more things in life than the union or\nseparation of man and woman. The great world stretches far beyond, and one can\ntruly measure one\'s joys and sorrows when standing in its midst.\n\nPanchu was devoted to my master. I know well enough how he manages to eke out\na livelihood. He is up before dawn every day, and with a basket of _pan_\nleaves, twists of tobacco, coloured cotton yarn, little combs, looking-\nglasses, and other trinkets beloved of the village women, he wades through the\nknee-deep water of the marsh and goes over to the Namasudra quarters. There he\nbarters his goods for rice, which fetches him a little more than their price\nin money. If he can get back soon enough he goes out again, after a hurried\nmeal, to the sweetmeat seller\'s, where he assists in beating sugar for wafers.\nAs soon as he comes home he sits at his shell-bangle making, plodding on often\ntill midnight. All this cruel toil does not earn, for himself and his family,\na bare two meals a day during much more than half the year. His method of\neating is to begin with a good filling draught of water, and his staple food\nis the cheapest kind of seedy banana. And yet the family has to go with only\none meal a day for the rest of the year.\n\nAt one time I had an idea of making him a charity allowance, "But," said my\nmaster, "your gift may destroy the man, it cannot destroy the hardship of his\nlot. Mother Bengal has not only this one Panchu. If the milk in her breasts\nhas run dry, that cannot be supplied from the outside."\n\nThese are thoughts which give one pause, and I decided to devote myself to\nworking it out. That very day I said to Bimal: "Let us dedicate our lives to\nremoving the root of this sorrow in our country."\n\n"You are my Prince Siddharta,  17 I see," she replied with a smile. "But do\nnot let the torrent of your feelings end by sweeping me away also!"\n\n"Siddharta took his vows alone. I want ours to be a joint arrangement."\n\nThe idea passed away in talk. The fact is, Bimala is at heart what is called a\n"lady". Though her own people are not well off, she was born a Rani. She has\nno doubts in her mind that there is a lower unit of measure for the trials and\ntroubles of the "lower classes". Want is, of course, a permanent feature of\ntheir lives, but does not necessarily mean "want" to them. Their very\nsmallness protects them, as the banks protect the pool; by widening bounds\nonly the slime is exposed.\n\nThe real fact is that Bimala has only come into my home, not into my life. I\nhad magnified her so, leaving her such a large place, that when I lost her, my\nwhole way of life became narrow and confined. I had thrust aside all other\nobjects into a corner to make room for Bimala--taken up as I was with\ndecorating her and dressing her and educating her and moving round her day and\nnight; forgetting how great is humanity and how nobly precious is man\'s life.\nWhen the actualities of everyday things get the better of the man, then is\nTruth lost sight of and freedom missed. So painfully important did Bimala make\nthe mere actualities, that the truth remained concealed from me. That is why I\nfind no gap in my misery, and spread this minute point of my emptiness over\nall the world. And so, for hours on this Autumn morning, the refrain has been\nhumming in my ears:\n\nIt is the month of August, and the sky breaks into a passionate rain;  \nAlas, my house is empty.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[17](hw21.htm#fr_16) The name by which Buddha was known when a Prince, before\nrenouncing the world.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI](hw22.htm)\n\n'
