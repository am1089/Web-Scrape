A purpose has to be attributed to the going (on the path of the gods) in\na twofold manner; otherwise there would be contradiction of scripture.\n\nIn some scriptural texts the (dead man's) going on the path of the gods is\nmentioned in connexion with his freeing himself from good and evil; in other\ntexts it is not mentioned. The doubt then arises whether the two things go\ntogether in all cases or only in certain cases.--The purvapakshin maintains\nthat the two are to be connected in all cases, just as the man's freeing\nhimself from his good and evil deeds is always followed by their passing over\nto his friends and enemies.\n\nTo this we make the following reply. That a man's going on the path of the\ngods has a purpose is to be admitted in a twofold manner, i.e. with a\ndistinction only. His going on that path has a sense in certain cases, in\nothers not. For otherwise, i.e. if we admitted that men,\n\np. 232\n\nin all cases, proceed on that path, we should have to assume that even the\npassage, Mu. Up. III, 1, 3, 'Shaking off good and evil, free from passions, he\nreaches the highest unity,' refers to actual going through which another place\nis reached, and that would clearly be contrary to reason. For a person free\nfrom all desire and therefore non-moving does not go to another place, and the\nhighest unity is not to be reached by a man transporting himself to another\nlocality.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 30](sbe38173.htm)\n\n"
