From the out- (and in-)\nbreathings he created the gods, and from the downward breathings the mortal\nbeings; and\n\np. 290\n\nabove the (mortal) beings he created Death as their consumer.\n\n10:1:3:22\\. Now, one half of that Pra _g_ apati was mortal, and the other half\nimmortal: with that part of him which was mortal he was afraid of death; and,\nbeing afraid, he became twofold, clay and water, and entered this (earth).\n\n10:1:3:33\\. Death spake unto the gods saying, 'What has become of him who has\ncreated us?'--'Being afraid of thee, he has entered this (earth),' they said.\nHe spake, 'Let us search for him, let us gather him up for I shall not injure\nhim.' The gods gathered him from out of this (earth): that part of him which\nwas in the water, they gathered as water, and that which was in this (earth,\nthey gathered) as clay. Having gathered together both clay and water, they\nmade a brick, whence a brick consists of both clay and water.\n\n10:1:3:44\\. And, indeed, these five forms (bodily parts) of him are mortal--\nthe hair on the mouth, the skin, the flesh, the bone, and the marrow; and\nthese are immortal--the mind, the voice, the vital air; the eye, and the ear.\n\n10:1:3:55\\. Now, that Pra _g_ apati is no other than the Fire-altar which is\nhere built up, and what five mortal parts there were of him, they are these\nlayers of earth; and those which were immortal they are these layers of\nbricks.\n\n10:1:3:66\\. The gods spake, 'Let us make him immortal!' Having encompassed\nthat mortal form by those immortal forms of his, they made it immortal--the\nlayer of earth by means of two layers of bricks: in like manner the second,\nthe third, and the fourth (layers of earth).\n\np. 291\n\n10:1:3:77\\. And having laid down the fifth layer (of bricks), he (the\nAdhvaryu) scatters earth on it; thereon he lays the Vikar _n_ i and the\nSvayamat _ri_ _n_ _n_ a, scatters chips of gold, and places the fire: that is\nthe seventh layer, and that (part) is immortal; and in this way, having\nencompassed that mortal form of his by those two immortal forms, they made it\nimmortal,--the layer of earth by means of two layers of bricks. Thereby, then,\nPra _g_ apati became immortal; and in like manner does the Sacrificer become\nimmortal by making that body (of the altar) immortal.\n\n10:1:3:88\\. But the gods knew not whether they had made him complete, or not;\nwhether they had made him too large, or left him defective. They saw this\nverse (Va _g_. S. XVIII, 76), 'The seat-hiding Agni, Indra, god Brahman, B\n_ri_ haspati, and the wise All-gods may speed our sacrifice unto bliss!'\n\n10:1:3:99\\. Of this (verse) one part is Agni's, one part Indra's, and one part\nthe All-gods';--with that part thereof which is Agni's they made up that part\nof him (Pra _g_ apati) which is Agni's, and with Indra's (part) that which is\nIndra's, and with the All-gods' (part) that which is the All-gods': in this\nvery (fire-altar) they thus made him up wholly and completely.\n\n10:1:3:1010\\. And when he stands by (the altar, worshipping it) with this\n(verse), he thereby secures (makes good) all that part of him (Pra _g_ apati)\nwhich, whether he knows it or not, he either does in excess or insufficiently\nin this (fire-altar),--whatever has not been secured for him. The 'seat-\nhiding' (verse) is an Anush _t_ ubh, for the Anush _t_ ubh is speech, and the\nseat-hider is speech: it is by speech that he\n\np. 292\n\nsecures for him what was not secured for him. 'Let him approach (the altar\nwith this verse) when he has covered a layer with earth,' say some, 'for then\nthat (layer) becomes whole and complete.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: X, 1, 4.
