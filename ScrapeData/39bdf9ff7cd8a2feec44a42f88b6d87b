Repetition, on account of the text teaching (what has to be done more than\nonce).\n\nThe third adhyaya was concerned with the consideration of meditation, together\nwith its means. The Sutras now enter on a consideration of the results of\nmeditation, after a further preliminary clearing up of the nature of\nmeditation. The question here arises whether the act of knowledge of Brahman\ninculcated in Vedanta-texts, such as 'He who knows Brahman reaches the\nHighest,' 'Having known him thus he passes beyond death,' 'He knows Brahman,\nhe becomes Brahman,' is, in the view of Scripture, to be performed once only,\nor to be repeated more than once.--Once suffices, the Purvapakshin maintains;\nfor as the text enjoins nothing more than knowing there is no authority for a\nrepetition of the act. Nor can it be said that the act of knowing, analogous\nto the act of beating the rice-grains until they are freed from the husks, is\na visible means towards effecting the intuition of Brahman, and hence must,\nlike the beating, be repeated until the effect is accomplished; for knowing is\nnot a visible means towards anything. Such acts as the _G_ yotish _t_ oma\nsacrifice and the knowledge inculcated in the Vedanta-texts are alike of the\nnature of conciliation of the Supreme Person; through whom thus conciliated\nman obtains all that is beneficial to him, viz. religious duty, wealth,\npleasure, and final Release. This has been shown under III, 2, 38. The meaning\nof Scripture therefore is accomplished by performing the act of knowledge once\nonly, as the _G_ yotish _t_ oma is performed once.--This view the Sutra sets\naside. The meaning of Scripture is fulfilled only by repeated acts of\nknowledge 'on account of teaching,' i.e. because the teaching of Scripture is\nconveyed\n\np. 716\n\nby means of the term 'knowing' (vedana), which is synonymous with meditating\n(dhyana, upasana). That these terms are so synonymous appears from the fact\nthat the verbs vid, upas, dhyai are in one and the same text used with\nreference to one and the same object of knowledge. A text begins, e.g. 'Let\nhim meditate (upasita) on mind as Brahman,' and concludes 'he who knows (veda)\nthis shines, warms,' &c. ( _Kh_. Up. III, 18). In the same way the knowledge\nof Raikva is at first referred to by means of vid, 'He who knows (veda) what\nhe knows is thus spoken of by me,' and further on by means of upas,'teach me\nthe deity on which you meditate' ( _Kh_. Up. IV, 1, 2). Similarly texts which\nhave the same meaning as the text 'He who knows Brahman reaches the Highest'--\nviz. 'the Self should be seen, be heard, be reflected on, be meditated upon\n(nididhyasitavya)'--'Then he sees him meditating (dhyayamana) on him as\nwithout parts' (Mu. Up. III, 1, 8), and others--use the verb dhyai to express\nthe meaning of vid. Now dhyai means to think of something not in the way of\nmere representation (sm _ri_ ti), but in the way of _continued_\nrepresentation. And upas has the same meaning; for we see it used in the sense\nof thinking with uninterrupted concentration of the mind on one object. We\ntherefore conclude that as the verb 'vid' is used interchangeably with dhyai\nand upas, the mental activity referred to in texts such as 'he knows Brahman'\nand the like is an often-repeated continuous representation.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 2.
