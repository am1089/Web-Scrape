The strength-begotten immortal never grows tired\n[1](sbe46012.htm#an_1:58:1:1), when he, the Hot _ri_ , has become the\nmessenger of Vivasvat [2](sbe46012.htm#an_1:58:1:2). He passes through the air\non the best paths. In the divine world he invites (the gods) with the\nsacrificial food.\n\n2\\. Seizing his own food the undecaying, greedy (Agni) stands on the brushwood\nwishing to drink. When he has been sprinkled (with ghee), he shines like a\nracer with his back [1](sbe46012.htm#an_1:58:2:1). Thundering he has roared\nlike the ridge of heaven.\n\n3\\. As soon as [1](sbe46012.htm#an_1:58:3:1) the Rudras, the Vasus have made\nhim their Purohita, the immortal sitting down as Hot _ri_ , the conqueror of\nwealth, pressing forward like a chariot among the clans, among the \xc3\x82yus\n[2](sbe46012.htm#an_1:58:3:2), the god in due course discloses desirable\nboons.\n\n4\\. Stirred by the wind he spreads among the brushwood lightly\n[1](sbe46012.htm#an_1:58:4:1),(driven forward) by the sacrificial ladles, with\nhis sickle [2](sbe46012.htm#an_1:58:4:2), loudly roaring. When thou, O Agni,\nthirstily rushest on the wooden sticks like a bull\n[3](sbe46012.htm#an_1:58:4:3), thy course, O never-aging god with fiery waves,\nbecomes black [4](sbe46012.htm#an_1:58:4:4).\n\n5\\. He who has fiery jaws, stirred by the wind, blazes down on the forest\n[1](sbe46012.htm#an_1:58:5:1) as a strong bull (rushes) on the herd. When he\nproceeds [2](sbe46012.htm#an_1:58:5:2) with his stream of light to the\nimperishable atmosphere, then what is moveable and immoveable (and) the winged\n(birds) are afraid.\n\n6\\. The Bh _ri_ gus have placed thee among men, who art beautiful like a\ntreasure, who art easy to\n\np. 46\n\ninvoke for people; thee the Hot _ri_ , O Agni, the excellent guest, a\ndelightful friend like Mitra to the divine race!\n\n7\\. I worship with good cheer Agni the steward [1](sbe46012.htm#an_1:58:7:1)\nof all treasures, whom the seven ladles [2](sbe46012.htm#an_1:58:7:2) (of the\npriests), the worshippers choose as the Hot _ri_ , the best sacrificer at the\nrites, and I pray for treasure [3](sbe46012.htm#an_1:58:7:3).\n\n8\\. Son of strength, great like Mitra, grant to-day flawless protection to us\nwho magnify thee. Agni! guard from distress with strongholds of iron him who\npraises thee, O offspring of vigour!\n\n9\\. Be a shelter to him who praises thee, O resplendent one; be protection,\ngenerous giver, to the generous. Agni! guard him who praises thee from\ndistress. May he who gives wealth for our prayer, come quickly in the morning\n[1](sbe46012.htm#an_1:58:9:1).\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe hymn is ascribed to Nodhas Gautama, who is considered as the _Ri_ shi of\nthe whole collection, I, 58-64\\. This tradition is based on, and confirmed by,\nseveral passages of the text: I, 61, 14; 62, 13; 64, 1.\n\nThe metre is _G_ agati verses 1-5, Trish _t_ ubh verses 6-9\\. None of the\nverses of this hymn occurs in the other Sa _m_ hitas.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. I believe that Professor Aufrecht (Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXV, 435) is\nright in reading nu\xc2\xb4 _k_ it saha _h_ - _g_ a\xc2\xb4 _h_ am _r i_ta _h_ nu tandate.\nComp. as to nu\xc2\xb4 _k_ it nu, I, 120, 2; VI, 37, 3; VII, 22, 8. Agni is\nfrequently called atandra _h_ duta _h_ or similarly. Possibly we might read,\ninstead of nu tandate, ni tandate, though parallel passages for the\ncombination of this root with ni are not known.--Prof. Max\n\np. 47\n\n[paragraph continues] Muller's opinion is different. He writes: We say, der\nFunke schlagt oder fangt. Why should not the Hindu have said that Agni strikes\nout. That would be vi tundate, Agni schlagt aus im Augenblick. But even ni\ntundate may have been used in the sense of the spark striking down on the\ntinder--the atasas, mentioned in verse 2--which he ignites. I should\ntranslate: 'The strength-begotten immortal strikes down or breaks forth (vi)\nquickly, whenever the Hot _ri_ (Agni) becomes the messenger of the sacrificer\n(?).'\n\nNote 2. I cannot follow Aufrecht in his translation 'zum boten des opfernden.'\nComp. on Agni as the messenger of Vivasvat, Bergaigne, Rel. Vedique, I, 87; H.\nO., Religion des Veda, 122, 275.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Literally, his back shines like a racer. On this kind of comparison,\nsee Bergaigne, Melanges Renier, 86; Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 107.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Kra _n_ a\xc2\xb4: comp. von Bradke, Dyaus Asura, Ahura Mazda und die Asuras,\np. 36; Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 70.\n\nNote 2. Bergaigne, Rel. Vedique, I, 59 seq.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. On v _r i_tha, see Geldner, Vedische Studien, I, 116; Neisser,\nBezzenberger's Beitrage, XIX, 148 seq.\n\nNote 2. The meaning is: with his flames which are sharp like a sickle. S _r i_\n_n_ i is written here as a paroxytonon; in several other passages it is an\noxytonon. Such differences are not quite rare, and there is no reason for\ntaking on this account s _r i_ _n_ ya as an instr. plur. fem. of the adjective\ns _r i_ _n_ ya, 'mit verkurzter Endung' (Geldner, loc. cit.). 'His sickle is\nthe sharp edge of Agni.' M. M.--On _g_ uhu\xc2\xb4bhi _h_ , comp. Pischel, Vedische\nStudien, II, 111.\n\np. 48\n\nNote 3. As to v _ri_ shayase with the accusative, comp. Gaedicke, 74. RV. X,\n44, 4. ur _g_ a _h_ skambham \xe2\x80\xa6 v _ri_ shayase.\n\nNote 4. With the last Pada comp. IV, 7, 9. k _ri_ sh _n_ am te ema ru _s_ ata\n_h_ pura _h_ bha\xc2\xb4 _h_.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. That is, among the fuel.\n\nNote 2. I think that we have here probably--(though, of course, this\nexplanation can be avoided)--an anacoluthon. The poet began with the\nnominative (abhivra _g_ an), and then he changed the construction and went on\nas if he had begun with the ablative, taking sthatu _h_ _k_ aratham (comp.\nLanman, 422) as the subject instead of Agni.--Patatri _n_ a _h_ seems to be\nnom. pl.; comp. I, 94, 11 (see below).\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. The translation of arati is only approximative and conjectural.\n\nNote 2. Comp. Pischel, Ved. Studien, II, 113.\n\nNote 3. Comp. III, 54, 3. saparya\xc2\xb4mi prayasa ya\xc2\xb4mi ratnam.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. The last Pada is the standing conclusion of the Nodhas hymns.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 59](sbe46013.htm)\n\n"
