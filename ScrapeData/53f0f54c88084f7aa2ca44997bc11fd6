Then he braced  \nHis coat of mail around his waist.  \nWhen, bright as blazing fire, upon  \nHis mighty limbs that armour shone,  \nThe hero stood like some great light  \nUprising in the dark of night.  \nHis dreadful shafts were by his side;  \nHis trusty bow he bent and plied.  \nPrepared he stood: the bowstring rang,  \nFilling the welkin with the clang.  \n\nThe high-souled Gods together drew  \nThe wonder of the fight to view,  \nThe saints made free from spot and stain,  \nAnd bright Gandharvas' heavenly train.  \nEach glorious sage the assembly sought,  \nEach saint divine of loftiest thought,  \nAnd filled with zeal for Rama's sake.  \nThus they whose deeds were holy spake:  \n\n'Now be it well with Brahmans, now  \nWell with the worlds and every cow!  \nLet Rama in the deadly fray  \nThe fiends who walk in darkness slay,  \nAs He who bears the discus 1 slew  \nThe chieftains of the Asur crew.'  \n\nThen each with anxious glances viewed  \nHis fellow and his speech renewed:  \n'There twice seven thousand giants stand  \nWith impious heart and cruel hand:  \nHere Rama stands, by virtue known:  \nHow can the hero fight alone?'  \n\nThus royal sage and Brahman saint,  \nSpirit, and Virtue free from taint,  \nAnd all the Gods of heaven who rode  \nOn golden cars, their longing showed.  \nTheir hearts with doubt and terror rent,  \nThey saw the giants' armament,  \nAnd Rama clothed in warrior might,  \nForth standing in the front of fight.  \nLord of the arm no toil might tire,  \nHe stood majestic in his ire,  \nMatchless in form as Rudra 2 when  \nHis wrath is fierce on Gods or men.  \n\nWhile Gods and saints in close array  \nHeld converse of the coming fray,  \nThe army of the fiends drew near  \nWith sight and sound that counselled fear.  \nLong, loud and deep their war-cry pealed,  \nAs on they rushed with flag and shield,  \nEach, of his proper valour proud,  \nUrging to fight the demon crowd.  \n\nHis ponderous bow each warrior tried,  \nAnd swelled his bulk with martial pride.  \n'Mid shout and roar and trampling feet.  \nAnd thunder of the drums they beat,  \nLoud and more loud the tumult went  \nThroughout the forest's vast extent,  \nAnd all the life that moved within  \nThe woodland trembled at the din.  \nIn eager haste all fled to find  \nSome tranquil spot, nor looked behind.  \n\nWith every arm of war supplied,  \nOn-rushing wildly like the tide  \nOf some deep sea, the giant host  \nApproached where Rama kept his post.  \nThen he, in battle skilled and tried,  \nBent his keen eye on every side,  \nAnd viewed the host of Khara face  \nTo face before his dwelling-place.  \nHe drew his arrows forth, and reared  \nAnd strained that bow which foemen feared,  \nAnd yielded to the vengeful sway  \nOf fierce desire that host to slay.  \nTerrific as the ruinous fire  \nThat ends the worlds, he glowed in ire;  \nAnd his tremendous form dismayed  \nThe Gods who roam the forest shade.  \nFor in the furious wrath that glowed  \nWithin his soul the hero showed  \nLike S'iva when his angry might  \nStayed Daksha's sacrificial rite. [1b](ry223.htm#fn_467)  \nLike some great cloud at dawn of day  \n   When first the sun upsprings,  \nAnd o'er the gloomy mass each ray  \n   A golden radiance flings:  \nThus showed the children of the night,  \n   Whose mail and chariots threw,  \nWith gleam of bows and armlets bright,  \n   Flashes of flamy hue.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[257:1](ry222.htm#fr_465) Vishnu, who bears a _chakra_ or discus.\n\n[257:2](ry222.htm#fr_466) S'iva.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXV.: The Battle.](ry223.htm)\n\n"
