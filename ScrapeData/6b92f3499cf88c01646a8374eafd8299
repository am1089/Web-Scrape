I see  \nThy form half hidden by the tree.  \nStay if thou love me, Sita, stay  \nIn pity cease thy heartless play,  \nWhy mock me now? thy gentle breast  \nWas never prone to cruel jest.  \n'Tis vain behind yon bush to steal:  \nThy shimmering silks thy path reveal.  \nFly not, mine eyes pursue thy way;  \nFor pity's sake, dear Sita, stay.  \nAh me, ah me, my words are vain;  \nMy gentle love is lost or slain.  \nHow could her tender bosom spurn  \nHer husband on his home-return?  \nAh no, my love is surely dead,  \nFierce giants on her flesh have fed,  \nRending the soft limbs of their prey  \nWhen I her lord was far away.  \nThat moon-bright face, that polished brow,  \nRed lips, bright teeth--what are they now?  \nAlas, my darling's shapely neck  \nShe loved with chains of gold to deck.--  \nThat neck that mocked the sandal scent,  \nThe ruthless fiends have grasped and rent  \nAlas, 'twas vain those arms to raise  \nSoft as the young tree's tender sprays  \nAh, dainty meal for giants' lips  \nWere arms and quivering finger tips.  \nAh, she who counted many a friend  \nWas left for fiends to seize and rend,  \nWas left by me without defence  \nFrom ravening giants' violence.  \nO Lakshman of the arm of might,  \n\nSay, is my darling love in sight;  \nO dearest Sita. where art thou?  \nWhere is my darling consort now?'  \n   Thus as he cried in wild lament  \nFrom grove to grove the mourner went.  \nHere for a moment sank to rest.  \nThen started up and onward pressed.  \nThus roaming on like one distraught  \nStill for his vanished love he sought.  \nHe searched in wood and hill and glade,  \nBy rock and brook and wild cascade.  \nThrough groves with restless step he sped  \nAnd left no spot unvisited.  \nThrough lawns and woods of vast extent  \nStill searching for his love he went  \n   With eager steps and fast.  \nFor many a weary hour he toiled,  \nStill in his fond endeavour foiled,  \n   Yet hoping to the last.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[300:1](ry259.htm#fr_508) _As'oka_ is compounded of _a_ not and _s'oka_ grief.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXII.: Rama's Lament.](ry260.htm)\n\n"
