I will now relate to you the history of the\nmarriage of Luchmuna, the daughter of Doorjodhun, how Sumboo went to\nHastinapoor, and married her. O great king! when the Raja Doorjodhun\'s\ndaughter, Luchmuna, was marriageable, her father sent letters of invitation to\nRajas of different countries, and appointed a day for the bride to select her\nown husband; having received intelligence of the day that had been appointed,\nShree Krishnu Chund\'s son, by Jamwutee, named Sumboo, came also to witness the\nceremony. On arriving there he beheld Rajas of all countries powerful,\npossessed of excellent qualities, the receptacles of beauty, very intelligent,\nwearing elegant dresses and jewelled ornaments, armed and silent, standing in\nrows in the midst of the assemblage, and the Kouruvus were standing in like\nmanner behind them; musical instruments resounded here and there outside; and\ninside musicians and singers were engaged in festivities; in the centre of all\nthe Raja\'s daughter, the beloved of her mother and father, was moving about\nlike a pupil of the eye, with a garland in her hand, and saying to herself,\n"Whom shall I marry?"\n\nO great king! when that sweet dispositioned girl, the abode of beauty,\ncarrying a garland, and blushing, came, in the course\n\np. 345\n\nof her circling, opposite Sumboo, she laid aside all reserve and bashfulness;\nand seizing him fearlessly by the hand, and seating him in her chariot,\nproceeded homewards. All the Rajas looked on in silent surprise, and Kurun,\nDron, Sulup, Bhoorisurwa, Doorjodhun and the other Kouruvus did not at that\ntime say a word; afterwards, being very angry, they began to say to each\nother, "See what he has done, spoiling all our pleasure, and making a happy\noccasion disagreeable!" Kurun said, "It is the constant practice of the\ndescendants of Judoo to do acts of violence on occasions of pleasure, and\nrejoicing." Suti said, "They are men of low caste, who have lately been\nexalted; since they obtained sovereignty, they have become insolent and\ndomineering." On hearing these words, all the Kouruvus in great wrath, and\nseizing their arms, rushed forth, saying, "Let us see what mighty man will\ntake way the girl from before us," and they went and surrounded Sumboo on the\nroad. Warlike weapons were brought into play on both sides, when at length the\nbattle had lasted some time, and Sumboo\'s charioteer had been killed, and he\nhimself had descended from his chariot, they surrounded and carried him away\nbound, making him stand up in the middle of the. assembly, they enquired,\n"Where is thy mighty power now gone?" He was ashamed at hearing this; at this\ntime, Narud Jee having come, said to Doorjodhun and all the Kouruvus, "This is\nShree Krishnu\'s son, by name Sumboo; do not say any thing to him, whatever was\nto happen, has happened, Shree Krishnu and Bulram will come here with an army,\nprepared for battle, immediately they receive intelligence of him, whatever\nyou have to say to him or hear from him, say and hear it; it is not at all\nbecoming to taunt a child, whatever act his boyish understanding may have\ndone."\n\nO great king! having thus spoken, Narud Jee took leave and proceeded to the\ncity of Dwarka, and went and stood in the court of the Raja Oogursen; they all\nrose at seeing him and bowed their heads, and instantly brought a seat for\nhim.\n\np. 346\n\n[paragraph continues] Narud Jee when seated said, "O great king! the Kouruvus\nhave bound Sumboo, and have inflicted, and are still inflicting, great pain\nupon him. If you wish to take thought of him, do so now; otherwise it will be\ndifficult for Sumboo to escape. The Kouruvus have become very proud, and have\nshown no respect or consideration for you, they have bound the child in a\nmanner that any one would bind an enemy." Raja Oogursen was very angry at\nhearing this, and having summoned the descendants of Judoo, said to them, Take\nall my army and advance against Hustinapoor, and having killed the Kouruvus,\nrelease and bring Sumboo here." When the army was ready to set out on\nreceiving the Raja\'s order, Bulram Jee went to explain to the Raja Oogursen,\nand said, "O great king! do not send an army against them; with your\npermission, I will go and complain to them and will have Sumboo released, and\nwill bring him away with me; I will see why they have bound him; unless I go,\nthe reason of this act will not appear." Upon this the Raja Oogursen gave\nBulram Jee permission to go to Hustinapoor; and Buldeo Jee went from Dwarka,\naccompanied by several great pundits, brahmins and by Narud, the sage, and\narrived at Hustinapoor. Bulram on his arrival, having encamped on a piece of\nenclosed ground, said to Narud Jee, "O great king! we have encamped here;\nplease go and inform the Kouruvus of my arrival." On receiving this order,\nNarud Jee went to the city and gave information of Bulram\'s arrival; having\nheard this news they all prepared to go out and meet him. Bheekum, Kurun and\nDron went together, taking handsome cloth dresses as presents. Doorjodhun went\nhastily forth, saying, "My spiritual preceptor, Sunburkhun, has come."\n\nHaving recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja,\n--O great king! all the Kouruvus went to the enclosure where Bulram was\nencamped to visit him, and offered him presents; and, having fallen at his\nfeet, joining\n\np. 347\n\ntheir hands, eulogized him highly; after this having applied perfume and\nsandal, and putting a garland of flowers upon him, and spreading silken\ncloths, they conducted him, in musical procession, to the city; they then\nentertained him with all kinds of delicacies; and, sitting near him, made\nvarious enquiries, "O great king! why have you come here?" Bulram Jee replied,\n"I have been sent by the Raja Oogursen to deliver a message to you." The\nKouruvus said, "What message?" Buldeo Jee replied, "The Raja says, that it was\nnot becoming in you to do an act of enmity towards him: you were many and he a\nsingle child; you fought with him, abandoning all understanding and\ndiscrimination; you intentionally committed a great injustice, and,\nrelinquishing respect for the world, laid hold of Krishnu\'s son; you have now\nbecome very proud, and have designedly afflicted him." O great king! on\nhearing these words the Kouruvus said, very angrily, "Enough! enough! Bulram\nJee, do not exalt Oogursen any more, as we will not listen to you; it is\nscarcely four days, since no one knew or respected Oogursen; from the time he\nconnected himself with us he has obtained high rank, and has now sent us a\nhaughty message: is he not ashamed, considering that he obtained sovereign\npower sitting quietly at Dwarka, to forget entirely his former condition, and\nnow to say whatever he pleases? Does he forget the day, when he used to\nassociate and eat with cowherds and Goojurs at Muttra? We have now reaped the\nfruits of allowing him to eat with us, and forming an alliance with him, and\nprocuring sovereign power for him. If we had done these good acts to a\nrespectable man, he would have been thankful for them all his life; some one\nhas said truly, \'That the friendship of a mean person is like a wall of\nsand.\'"\n\nHaving proceeded thus far in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great\nking! discoursing much in this strain, Kurun, Dron, Bheekum, Doorjodhun and\nall the Kuoruvus rose haughtily and went to their homes. Bulram Jee laughing\nat\n\np. 348\n\nwhat they had said, thought to himself, "They are proud of their royal power\nand strength, and, therefore speak in this strain; otherwise, would they treat\nwith such disrespect that Oogursen, who is the lord of Bruhmu, Roodru and\nIndru, to whom the three bow their heads? As my name is Buldeo, I will drown\nall the Kouruvus with their city in the Ganges."\n\nO great king! having thus said, Buldeo Jee in great wrath laid hold of all the\nKouruvus and their city with his plough, and took them to a bank of the\nGanges, and was on the point of drowning them, when all the Kouruvus came in\nthe greatest alarm and consternation, with joined hands, bowing their heads,\nand beseeching earnestly, began to say, in a submissive tone, "O great king!\nforgive our fault; we have come to you for protection, save us now, and we\nwill do whatever you may order, and will be always obedient to the commands of\nRaja Oogursen."\n\nWhen, O great king! they had thus spoken, the wrath of Bulram Jee was\nappeased, and he allowed the city to remain on the site, to which, with his\nplough, he had drawn it, on the banks of the Ganges. From that day Hustinapoor\nhas been on the banks of the Ganges, formerly it was not there; he afterwards\nreleased Sumboo, and Raja Doorjodhun, having propitiated his uncle and\nnephews, and taken them to his house, prepared a festive entertainment, and\ngave his daughter in marriage to Sumboo according to the prescribed\ninjunctions of the Vedas; and presented her with a very handsome dowry.\n\nHaving recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great\nking; thus did Bulram Jee go to Hustinapoor, lower the pride of the Kouruvus,\nrelease his nephew and bring him home after his marriage. At that time there\nwas joy in all the city of Dwarka; and Buldea Jee went and explained to the\nRaja Oogursen all the circumstances connected with Hustinapoor.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LXX](psa71.htm)\n\n'
