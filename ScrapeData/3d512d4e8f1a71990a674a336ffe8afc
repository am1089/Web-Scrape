Beyond lightning (there is) Varu _n_ a, on account of the connexion (of\nthe two).\n\nThe _Kh_ andogya continues, 'From \xc3\x82ditya to the moon, from the moon to\nlightning.' Here Varu _n_ a (mentioned in the Kaushitaki-upan.) has to be\nbrought in so that above that lightning he goes to the world of Varu _n_ a.\nFor there is a connexion between lightning and Varu _n_ a; the broad\nlightnings dance forth from the womb of the clouds with the sound of deep\nthunder, and then water falls down. And a Brahma _n_ a also says, 'It\nlightens, it thunders, it will rain' ( _Kh_. Up. VII, 11, 1). But the lord of\nall water is Varu _n_ a, as known from _S_ ruti and Sm _ri_ ti.--And above\nVaru _n_ a there come Indra and Pra _g_ apati, as there is no other place for\nthem, and according to the force of the text, as it stands. Varu _n_ a and so\non should be inserted at the end, for that reason also that they are merely\nadditional, no particular place being assigned to them. And lightning is the\nend of the road beginning with light 1.\n\np. 387\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[386:1](sbe38304.htm#fr_226) So that Varu _n_ a and so on are to be placed\nafter lightning.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 3, 4](sbe38305.htm)\n\n"
