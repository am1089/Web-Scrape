At no time has been found a\ndestroyer of sins like this. B\xc4\xabj\xc4\x81kshara (seed-letter) is the supreme bin\xe1\xb8\x8du.\nN\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da (spiritual sound) is above it. When that n\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da ceases along with letter,\nthan the n\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da-less is supreme state. That yogin who considers as the highest\nthat which is above n\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da, which is an\xc4\x81ha\xe1\xb9\xada, 2 has all his doubts destroyed. If\nthe point of a hair be divided into one-hundred thousand parts, this (n\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da) is\none-half of that still further divided; and when (even) this is absorbed, the\nyogin attains to the stainless Brahman. One who is of a firm mind and without\nthe delusion (of sensual pleasures) and ever resting in Brahman, should see\nlike the string (in a rosary of beads) all creatures (as existing) in \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81\nlike odour in flowers, ghee in milk, oil in gingelly seeds and gold in quartz.\nAgain just as the oil depends for its manifestation upon gingelly seeds and\nodour upon flowers, so does the Purusha depend for its existence upon the\nbody, both external and internal. The tree is with parts and its shadow is\nwithout parts but with and without parts, \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 exists everywhere.\n\nThe one akshara (letter Om) should be contemplated upon as Brahman by all who\naspire for emancipation. P\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadhiv\xc4\xab, agni, \xe1\xb9\x9bgve\xe1\xb8\x8da, bh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb8\xa5 and Brahm\xc4\x81--all these\n(are absorbed) when Ak\xc4\x81ra\n\np. 203\n\n[paragraph continues] (A), the first am\xc5\x9ba (part) of pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava (Om) becomes\nabsorbed. An\xe1\xb9\xadariksha, yajurve\xe1\xb8\x8da, v\xc4\x81yu, bhuva\xe1\xb8\xa5 and Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u, the Jan\xc4\x81r\xe1\xb8\x8dana--all\nthese (are absorbed) when Uk\xc4\x81ra (U), the second am\xc5\x9ba of pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava becomes\nabsorbed. \xe1\xb8\x8cyur, sun, s\xc4\x81mave\xe1\xb8\x8da, suva\xe1\xb8\xa5 and Mahe\xc5\x9bvara--all these (are absorbed)\nwhen Mak\xc4\x81ra (M), the third am\xc5\x9ba of pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava becomes absorbed. Ak\xc4\x81ra is of\n(p\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada) yellow colour and is said to be of rajogu\xe1\xb9\x87a; Uk\xc4\x81ra is of white colour\nand of sa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadvagu\xe1\xb9\x87a; Mak\xc4\x81ra is of dark colour and of \xe1\xb9\xadamogu\xe1\xb9\x87a. He who does not\nknow Omk\xc4\x81ra as having eight a\xe1\xb9\x85gas (parts), four p\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8das (feet), three s\xe1\xb9\xadh\xc4\x81nas\n(seats) and five \xe1\xb8\x8deva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81s (presiding deities) is not a Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a. Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava is the\nbow. \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 is the arrow and Brahman is said to be the aim. One should aim at it\nwith great care and then he, like the arrow, becomes one with It. When that\nHighest is cognised, all karmas return (from him, _viz_., do not affect him).\nThe Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das have Omk\xc4\x81ra as their cause. The swaras (sounds) have Omk\xc4\x81ra as their\ncause. The three worlds with (all) the locomotive and the fixed (ones in them)\nhave Omk\xc4\x81ra as their cause. The short (accent of Om) burns all sins, the long\none is decayless and the bestower of prosperity. United with ar\xe1\xb8\x8dham\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81 (half-\nmetre of Om), the pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava becomes the bestower of salvation. That man is the\nknower of the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das who knows that the end ( _viz_., ar\xe1\xb8\x8dham\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81) of pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava\nshould be worshipped (or recited) as uninterrupted as the flow of oil and\n(resounding) as long as the sound of a bell. One should contemplate upon\nOmk\xc4\x81ra as \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara resembling an unshaken light, as of the size of a thumb and\nas motionless in the middle of the pericarp of the lotus of the heart. Taking\nin v\xc4\x81yu through the left nostril and filling the stomach with it, one should\ncontemplate upon Omk\xc4\x81ra as being in the middle of the body and as surrounded\nby circling flames. Brahma is said to be inspiration; Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u is said to be\ncessation (of breath), and Ru\xe1\xb8\x8dra is said to be expiration. These are the\n\xe1\xb8\x8deva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81s of pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81ma. Having made \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 as the (lower) ara\xe1\xb9\x87i (sacrificial wood)\nand pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava as the upper ara\xe1\xb9\x87i, one should see the God in secret through the\npractice of churning which is \xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81na. One should practise restraint of breath\nas much as it lies in his power along with (the uttering of)\n\np. 204\n\n[paragraph continues] Omk\xc4\x81ra sound, until it ceases completely. Those who look\nupon Om as of the form of Hamsa staying in all, shining like crores of suns,\nbeing alone, staying in gam\xc4\x81gama (ever going and coming) and being devoid of\nmotion--at last such persons are freed from sin. That manas which is the\nauthor of the actions ( _viz_.), creation, preservation and destruction of the\nthree worlds, is (then) absorbed (in the supreme One). That is the highest\nstate of Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u.\n\nThe lotus of the heart has eight petals and thirty-two filaments. The sun is\nin its midst: the moon is in the middle of the sun. Agni is in the middle of\nthe moon: the prabh\xc4\x81 (spiritual light) is in the middle of agni. P\xc4\xabtha (seat\nor centre) is in the midst of prabh\xc4\x81, being set in diverse gems. One should\nmeditate upon the stainless Lord V\xc4\x81su\xe1\xb8\x8deva as being (seated) upon the centre of\nP\xc4\xabtha, as having \xc5\x9ar\xc4\xabva\xe1\xb9\xadsa 1 (black mark) and Kaus\xe1\xb9\xadubha (garland of gems) on\nhis chest and as adorned with gems and pearls resembling pure crystal in\nlustre and as resembling crores of moons in brightness. He should meditate\nupon Mah\xc4\x81-Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u as above or in the following manner. (That is) he should\nmeditate with inspiration (of breath) upon Mah\xc4\x81-Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u as resembling the a\xe1\xb9\xadas\xc4\xab\nflower and as staying in the seat of navel with four hands; then with\nrestraint of breath, he should meditate in the heart upon Brahma, the\nGrandfather as being on the lotus with the gaura (pale-red) colour of gems and\nhaving four faces: then through expiration, he should meditate upon the three-\neyed \xc5\x9aiva between the two eyebrows shining like the pure crystal, being\nstainless, destroying all sins, being in that which is like the lotus facing\ndown with its flower (or face) below and the stalk above or like the flower of\na plantain tree, being of the form of all Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das, containing one hundred petals\nand one hundred leaves and having the pericarp full-expanded. There he should\nmeditate upon the sun, the moon and the agni, one above another. Passing above\nthrough the lotus which has the brightness of the sun, moon and agni, and\ntaking its Hr\xc4\xabm b\xc4\xabja (letter), one leads his \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 firmly. He is the knower of\nVe\xe1\xb8\x8das\n\np. 205\n\nwho knows the three seats, the three m\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81s, the three Brahm\xc4\x81s, the three\naksharas (letters) and the three m\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81s associated with the ar\xe1\xb8\x8dham\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81. He who\nknows that which is above bin\xe1\xb8\x8du, n\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da and kal\xc4\x81 as uninterrupted as the flow of\noil and (resounding) as long as the sound of a bell--that man is a knower of\nthe Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das. Just as a man would draw up (with his mouth) the water through the\n(pores of the) lotus-stalk, so the yogin treading the path of yoga should draw\nup the breath. Having made the lotus-sheath of the form of ar\xe1\xb8\x8dham\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81, one\nshould draw up the breath through the stalk (of the n\xc4\x81dis Sushumn\xc4\x81, Id\xc4\x81 and\nPi\xe1\xb9\x85gal\xc4\x81) and absorb it in the middle of the eyebrows. He should know that the\nmiddle of the eyebrows in the forehead which is also the root of the nose is\nthe seat of nectar. That is the great place of Brahman.\n\nPostures, restraint of breath, subjugation of the senses \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81, \xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81na and\nsam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi are the six parts of yoga. There are as many postures as there are\nliving creatures; and Mahe\xc5\x9bvara (the great Lord) knows their distinguishing\nfeatures. Si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dha, bha\xe1\xb8\x8dra, simha and pa\xe1\xb8\x8dma are the four (chief) postures.\nM\xc5\xabl\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra is the first chakra. Sv\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhishth\xc4\x81na is the second. Between these two\nis said to be the seat of yoni (perineum), having the form of K\xc4\x81ma (God of\nlove). In the \xc4\x80dh\xc4\x81ra of the anus, there is the lotus of four petals. In its\nmidst is said to be the yoni called K\xc4\x81ma and worshipped by the si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhas. In the\nmidst of the yoni is the Li\xe1\xb9\x85ga facing the west and split at its head like the\ngem. He who knows this, is a knower of the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das. A four-sided figure is\nsituated above agni and below the genital organ, of the form of molten gold\nand shining like streaks of lightning. Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a is with its sva (own) sound,\nhaving Sv\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhishth\xc4\x81na as its a\xe1\xb8\x8dhishth\xc4\x81na (seat), (or since sva or pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a arises\nfrom it). The chakra Sv\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhishth\xc4\x81na is spoken of as the genital organ itself.\nThe chakra in the sphere of the navel is called Ma\xe1\xb9\x87ip\xc5\xabraka, since the body is\npierced through by v\xc4\x81yu like ma\xe1\xb9\x87is (gems) by string. The j\xc4\xabva (ego) urged to\nactions by its past virtuous and sinful karmas whirls about in this great\nchakra of twelve 1 spokes, so long as it\n\np. 206\n\ndoes not grasp the truth. Above the genital organ and below the navel is kan\xe1\xb8\x8da\nof the shape of a bird's egg. There arise (from it) n\xc4\x81dis seventy-two thousand\nin number. Of these seventy-two are generally known. Of these, the chief ones\nare ten and carry the pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as. Id\xc4\x81, Pi\xe1\xb9\x85gal\xc4\x81, Sushumn\xc4\x81, G\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81r\xc4\xab, Has\xe1\xb9\xadijihv\xc4\x81,\nPasha, Ya\xc5\x9basvin\xc4\xab, Alambus\xc4\x81, Kuh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb8\xa5 and \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x85khin\xc4\xab are said to be the ten. This\nchakra of the midis should ever be known by the yogins. The three n\xc4\x81dis Ida,\nPi\xe1\xb9\x85gal\xc4\x81 and Sushumn\xc4\x81 are said to carry pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a always and have as their \xe1\xb8\x8deva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81s,\nmoon, sun and agni. Id\xc4\x81 is on the left side and Pi\xe1\xb9\x85gal\xc4\x81 on the right side,\nwhile the Sushumn\xc4\x81 is in the middle. These three are known to be the paths of\npr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a. Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a, Ap\xc4\x81na, Sam\xc4\x81na, U\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81na, and Vy\xc4\x81na; Naga, Karma, K\xe1\xb9\x9bkara, \xe1\xb8\x8ceva\xe1\xb8\x8da\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada\nand \xe1\xb8\x8chana\xc3\xb1jaya; of these, the first five are called pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as, etc., and last\nfive Naga, etc. are called v\xc4\x81yus (or sub-pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as). All these are situated (or\nrun along) the one thousand n\xc4\x81dis, (being) in the form of (or producing) life.\nJ\xc4\xabva which is under the influence of pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a and ap\xc4\x81na goes up and down. J\xc4\xabva on\naccount of its ever moving by the left and right paths is not visible. Just as\na ball struck down (on the earth) with the bat of the hand springs up, so j\xc4\xabva\never tossed by pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a and ap\xc4\x81na is never at rest. He is knower of yoga who\nknows that pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a always draws itself from ap\xc4\x81na and ap\xc4\x81na draws itself from\npr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a, like a bird (drawing itself from and yet not freeing itself) from the\nstring (to which it is tied).\n\nThe j\xc4\xabva comes out with the letter _Ha_ and gets in again with the letter\n_Sa_. Thus j\xc4\xabva always utters the man\xe1\xb9\xadra 'Ham-sa,' 'Hamsa'. The j\xc4\xabva always\nutters the man\xe1\xb9\xadra twenty-one thousand and six hundred times in one day and\nnight. This is called Ajap\xc4\x81 G\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\xab and is ever the bestower of nirv\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a to the\nyogins. Through its very thought, man is freed from sins. Neither in the past\nnor in the future is there a science equal to this, a japa equal to this or a\nmeritorious action equal to this. Parame\xc5\x9bvar\xc4\xab ( _viz_., kun\xe1\xb8\x8dalin\xc4\xab \xc5\x9bak\xe1\xb9\xadi)\nsleeps shutting with her mouth that door which leads to the decayless Brahma-\nhole. Being aroused by the contact of agni with manas and pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a, she takes the\nform of a needle and pierces up through Sushumn\xc4\x81. The\n\np. 207\n\nyogin should open with great effort this door which is shut. Then he will\npierce the door to salvation by means of kun\xe1\xb8\x8dalin\xc4\xab. Folding firmly the fingers\nof the hands, assuming firmly the Pa\xe1\xb8\x8dma posture, placing the chin firmly on\nthe breast and fixing the mind in \xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a, one should frequently raise up the\nap\xc4\x81na, fill up with air and then leave the pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a. Then the wise man gets\nmatchless wisdom through (this) \xc5\x9bak\xe1\xb9\xadi. That yogin who assuming Pa\xe1\xb8\x8dma posture\nworships ( _i.e._ , controls) v\xc4\x81yu at the door of the n\xc4\x81dis and then performs\nrestraint of breath is released without doubt. Rubbing off the limbs the sweat\narising from fatigue, abandoning all acid, bitter and saltish (food), taking\ndelight in the drinking of milk and rasa, practising celibacy, being moderate\nin eating and ever bent on yoga, the yogin becomes a si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dha in little more\nthan a year. No inquiry need be made concerning the result. Ku\xe1\xb9\x87dalin\xc4\xab \xc5\x9bak\xe1\xb9\xadi,\nwhen it is up in the throat, makes the yogi get si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi. The union of pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a and\nap\xc4\x81na has the extinction of urine and faeces.\n\nOne becomes young even when old through performing m\xc5\xablaban\xe1\xb8\x8dha always. Pressing\nthe yoni by means of the heels and contracting the anus and drawing up the\nap\xc4\x81na--this is called m\xc5\xablaban\xe1\xb8\x8dha. Uddiy\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a ban\xe1\xb8\x8dha is so called because it is\n(like) a great bird that flies up always without rest. One should bring the\nwestern part of the stomach above the navel. This Uddiy\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a ban\xe1\xb8\x8dha is a lion to\nthe elephant of death, since it binds the water (or nectar) of the \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b which\narises in the head and flows down. The J\xc4\x81lan\xe1\xb8\x8dhara ban\xe1\xb8\x8dha is the destroyer of\nall the pains of the throat. When this J\xc4\x81lan\xe1\xb8\x8dhara ban\xe1\xb8\x8dha which is destroyer of\nthe pains of the throat is performed, then nectar does not fall on agni nor\ndoes the v\xc4\x81yu move. When the tongue enters backwards into the hole of the\nskull, then there is the mu\xe1\xb8\x8dr\xc4\x81 of vision latent in the eyebrow called\nkhechar\xc4\xab. He who knows the mu\xe1\xb8\x8dr\xc4\x81, khechar\xc4\xab has not disease, death, sleep,\nhunger, thirst, or swoon. He who practises this mu\xe1\xb8\x8dr\xc4\x81 is not affected by\nillness or karma; nor is he bound by the limitations of time. Since chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada\nmoves in the kha (\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b) and since the tongue has entered (in the mu\xe1\xb8\x8dr\xc4\x81) kha (\n_viz_., the hole in the mouth), therefore the mu\xe1\xb8\x8dr\xc4\x81 is called khechar\xc4\xab and\nworshipped by\n\np. 208\n\nthe si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhas. He whose hole (or passage) above the uvula is closed (with the\ntongue backwards) by means of khechar\xc4\xabmu\xe1\xb8\x8dr\xc4\x81 never loses his virility, even\nwhen embraced by a lovely woman. Where is the fear of death, so long as the\nbin\xe1\xb8\x8du (virility) stays in the body. Bin\xe1\xb8\x8du does not go out of the body, so long\nas the khechar\xc4\xabmu\xe1\xb8\x8dr\xc4\x81 is practised. (Even) when bin\xe1\xb8\x8du comes down to the sphere\nof the perineum, it goes up, being prevented and forced up by violent effort\nthrough yonimu\xe1\xb8\x8dr\xc4\x81. This bin\xe1\xb8\x8du is twofold, white and red. The white one is\ncalled \xc5\x9bukla and the red one is said to contain much rajas. The rajas which\nstays in yoni is like the colour of a coral. The bin\xe1\xb8\x8du stays in the seat of\nthe genital organs. The union of these two is very rare. Bin\xe1\xb8\x8du is \xc5\x9aiva and\nrajas is \xc5\x9bak\xe1\xb9\xadi. Bin\xe1\xb8\x8du is the moon and rajas is the sun. Through the union of\nthese two is attained the highest body; when rajas is roused up by agitating\nthe \xc5\x9bak\xe1\xb9\xadi through v\xc4\x81yu which unites with the sun, thence is produced the\ndivine form. \xc5\x9aukla being united with the moon and rajas with the sun, he is a\nknower of yoga who knows the proper mixture of these two. The cleansing of the\naccumulated refuse, the unification of the sun and the moon and the complete\ndrying of the rasas (essences), this is called mah\xc4\x81mu\xe1\xb8\x8dr\xc4\x81. Placing the chin on\nthe breast, pressing the anus by means of the left heel, and seizing (the toe\nof) the extended right leg by the two hands, one should fill his belly (with\nair) and should slowly exhale. This is called mah\xc4\x81mu\xe1\xb8\x8dr\xc4\x81, the destroyer of the\nsins of men.\n\nNow I shall give a description of \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. In the seat of the heart is a lotus of\neight petals. In its centre is j\xc4\xabv\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 of the form of jyo\xe1\xb9\xadis and atomic in\nsize, moving in a circular line. In it is located everything. It knows\neverything. It does everything. It does all these actions attributing\neverything to its own power, (thinking) I do, I enjoy, I am happy, I am\nmiserable, I am blind, I am lame, I am deaf, I am mute, I am lean, I am stout,\netc. When it rests on the eastern petal which is of \xc5\x9bve\xe1\xb9\xada (white) colour, then\nit has a mind (or is inclined) to \xe1\xb8\x8dharma with bhak\xe1\xb9\xadi (devotion). When it rests\non the southeastern petal, which is of rak\xe1\xb9\xada (blood colour), then it is\ninclined\n\np. 209\n\nto sleep and laziness. When it rests on the southern petal, which is of k\xe1\xb9\x9bsh\xe1\xb9\x87a\n(black) colour, then it is inclined to hate and anger. When it rests on the\nsouth-western petal which is of n\xc4\xabla (blue) colour, then it gets desire for\nsinful or harmful actions. When it rests on the western petal which is of\ncrystal colour, then it is inclined to flirt and amuse. When it rests on the\nnorth-western petal which is of ruby colour, then it has a mind to walk, rove\nand have vair\xc4\x81gya (or be indifferent). When it rests on, the northern petal\nwhich is pita (yellow) colour, then it is inclined to be happy and to be\nloving. When it rests on the north-eastern petal which is of vaid\xc5\xabrya (lapis\nlazuli) colour, then it is inclined to amassing money, charity and passion.\nWhen it stays in the interspace between any two petals, then it gets the wrath\narising from diseases generated through (the disturbance of the equilibrium\nof) v\xc4\x81yu, bile and phlegm (in the body). When it stays in the middle, then it\nknows everything, sings, dances, speaks and is blissful. When the eye is\npained (after a day's work), then in order to remove (its) pain, it makes\nfirst a circular line and sinks in the middle. The first line is of the colour\nof ban\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc5\xabka flower (Bassia). Then is the state of sleep. In the middle of the\nstate of sleep is the state of dream. In the middle of the state of dream, it\nexperiences the ideas of perception, Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das, inference, possibility, (sacred)\nwords, etc. Then there arises much fatigue. In order to remove this fatigue,\nit circles the second line and sinks in the middle. The second is of the\ncolour of (the insect) In\xe1\xb8\x8dragopa (of red or white colour). Then comes the\nstate of dreamless sleep.\n\nDuring the dreamless sleep, it has only the thought connected with Parame\xc5\x9bvara\n(the highest Lord) alone. This state is of the nature of eternal wisdom.\nAfterwards it attains the nature of the highest Lord (Parame\xc5\x9bvara). Then it\nmakes a round of the third circle and sinks in the middle. The third circle is\nof the colour of pa\xe1\xb8\x8dmar\xc4\x81ga (ruby). Then comes the state of \xe1\xb9\xadurya (the fourth).\nIn \xe1\xb9\xadurya, there is only the connection of Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. It attains the nature of\neternal wisdom. Then one should gradually attain the quiescence of bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi with\n\np. 210\n\nself-control. Placing the manas in \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, one should think of nothing else.\nThen causing the union of pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a and ap\xc4\x81na, he concentrates his aim upon the\nwhole universe being of the nature of \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadma. Then comes the state of tury\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada\n( _viz_., that state beyond the fourth). Then everything appears as bliss. He\nis beyond the pairs (of happiness and pains, etc.). He stays here as long as\nhe should wear his body. Then he attains the nature of Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 and attains\nemancipation through this means. This alone is the means of knowing \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81.\n\nWhen v\xc4\x81yu (breath) which enters the great hole associated with a hall where\nfour roads meet gets into the half of the well-placed triangle, 1 then is\nAchyu\xe1\xb9\xada (the indestructible) seen. Above the aforesaid triangle, one should\nmeditate on the five b\xc4\xabja (seed) letters of (the elements) p\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadhiv\xc4\xab, etc., as\nalso on the five pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as, the colour of the b\xc4\xabjas and their position. The\nletter \xe0\xa4\xaf 2 is the b\xc4\xabja of pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a and resembles the blue cloud. The letter \xe0\xa4\xb0 is\nthe b\xc4\xabja of agni, is of ap\xc4\x81na and resembles the sun. The letter \xe0\xa4\xb2 is the b\xc4\xabja\nof p\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadhiv\xc4\xab, is of vy\xc4\x81na and resembles ban\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc5\xabka flower. The letter \xe0\xa4\xb5 is the\nb\xc4\xabja of j\xc4\xabva (or vayu), is of ud\xc4\x81na and is of the colour of the conch. The\nletter \xe0\xa4\xb9 is the b\xc4\xabja of \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, is of sam\xc4\x81na, and is of the colour of crystal.\nPr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a stays in the heart, navel, nose, ear, foot, finger, and other places,\ntravels through the seventy-two thousand n\xc4\x81dis, stays in the twenty-eight\ncrores of hair-pores and is yet the same everywhere. It is that which is\ncalled j\xc4\xabva. One should perform the three, expiration, etc., with a firm will\nand great control: and drawing in everything (with the breath) in slow\ndegrees, he should bind pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a and ap\xc4\x81na in the cave of the lotus of the heart\nand utter pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava, having contracted his throat and the genital organ. From\nthe M\xc5\xabl\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra (to the head) is the Sushumn\xc4\x81 resembling the shining thread of\nthe lotus. The n\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da is located in the V\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da\xe1\xb9\x87da, (spinal column); that sound\nfrom its middle resembles (that of) the conch, etc. When it goes to the hole\nof the \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, it resembles that of the peacock. In the middle of the cave of\nthe\n\np. 211\n\nskull between the four doors shines \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, like the sun in the sky. Between the\ntwo bows in the Brahma-hole, one should see Purusha with \xc5\x9bak\xe1\xb9\xadi as his own\n\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. Then his manas is absorbed there. That man attains kaivalya who\nunderstands the gems, moonlight, n\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da, bin\xe1\xb8\x8du, and the seat of Mahe\xc5\x9bvara (the\ngreat Lord).\n\nThus is the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[202:1](tmu26.htm#fr_162) The Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d of the seed of meditation.\n\n[202:2](tmu26.htm#fr_163) Of the heart.\n\n[204:1](tmu26.htm#fr_164) The black mark on the breast standing for\nm\xc5\xablaprak\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadi and the garland for the five elements.\n\n[205:1](tmu26.htm#fr_165) In other places, it is ten.\n\n[210:1](tmu26.htm#fr_166) Probably it refers to the triangle of the initiates.\n\n[210:2](tmu26.htm#fr_167) There seems to be some mistake in the original.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 25.
