D. Barnett, [1911], at sacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\n#### XIII. Light And Darkness 1\n\nIn the Lord is to be veiled this universe, whatsoever stirs in the world. With\nrenunciation thereof 2 thou mayst enjoy; lust thou after the wealth of none.\n\np. 89\n\nOne may seek to live a hundred years doing works here. So it is with thee, not\notherwise; his work defiles not man. 1\n\nDaemonic are in sooth these worlds, veiled in blind darkness; into them pass\nafter death whatsoever folk slay their own souls.\n\nThe One, unstirring, is yet swifter than the mind; the gods cannot reach it as\nit travels before. Standing it outspeeds others that run; in it the Wind-\nspirit lays the waters.\n\nIt stirs, and stirs not; it is far, and near. It is within all, and outside\nall that is.\n\nBut he who discerns all creatures in his Self, and his Self in all creatures,\nhas no disquiet thence.\n\nWhat delusion, what grief can be with him in whom all creatures have become\nthe very self of the thinker discerning their oneness?\n\nHe has spread around, a thing bright, bodiless, taking no hurt, sinewless,\npure, unsmitten by evil; a sage, wise, encompassing, self-existent, he has\nduly assigned purposes for all time.\n\nInto blind darkness pass they who worship Ignorance; into still greater dark\nthey who are content with Knowledge. 2\n\nIt is neither what comes by Knowledge, they\n\np. 90\n\nsay, nor what comes by Ignorance; thus have we heard from the sages who taught\nus this lore.\n\nHe who understands both Knowledge and Ignorance 1 passes by Ignorance over\ndeath and by Knowledge enjoys deathlessness.\n\nInto blind darkness pass they who worship Change-into-naught; into still\ngreater dark they who worship Change-into-aught. 2\n\nIt is neither what comes by Change-into-aught, they say, nor what comes by\nChange-into-naught; thus have we heard from the sages who taught us this lore.\n\nHe who understands 3 both Change-into-aught and Destruction passes by\nDestruction over death and by Change-into-aught enjoys deathlessness.\n\nThe face of truth is covered with a golden bowl. O P\xc5\xabshan, remove it, that the\nkeeper of truths may see. 4\n\nO P\xc5\xabshan, sole seer, O Yama, Sun, child of\n\np. 91\n\n[paragraph continues] Praj\xc4\x81-pati, part asunder thy rays, mass together thy\nradiance. I see that fairest shape of thee. Yonder, yonder spirit am I.\n\nThe breath to the everlasting wind; and be this body ended in ashes.\n\nOm! remember, O my spirit, remember the work! remember, O my spirit, remember\nthe work! O Fire, lead us by good ways to riches, thou god who knowest all\ncourses; keep far from us crooked sin, and we will offer to thee exceeding\nhomage and praise.

His\ncardinal principle is that Being is one and changeless.\n\n[90:3](brk41.htm#fr_54) I.e., he who knows both ideas to be false.\n\n[90:4](brk41.htm#fr_55) This and the following verses (a death-bed prayer,\naccording to tradition) are a prayer to the Sun-god to reveal the figure of\nthe _Purusha_ in the sun (corresponding to the figure in the human eye, and\nsymbolic of Brahma; see p. 16). The Sun-god is here identified with Yama, the\nruler of the dead. On Praj\xc4\x81-pati, see p. 14; in the next extract he is\nmythically represented as a teacher of philosophic lore.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIV: The False and the True](brk42.htm)\n\n'
