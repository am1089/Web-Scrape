Now this\nKing went and laid him down to rest at a place where four roads met, so that\nevery one who passed had to step over him.\n\nAt last a Fakir came along, and he said to the King, "Man, why are you lying\nhere?"\n\nHe replied, "Fakir, a thousand men have come and passed by; you pass on too."\n\nBut the Fakir said, "Who are you, man?"\n\nThe King replied, "I am a King, Fakir. Of goods and gold I have no lack, but I\nhave lived long and have no children. So I have come here, and have laid me\ndown at the cross-roads. My sins and offences have been very many, so I have\ncome and am lying here that men may pass over me, and perchance my sins may be\nforgiven me, and God may he merciful, and I may have a son."\n\nThe Fakir answered him, " O King! If you have children, what will you give\nme?"\n\n"Whatever you ask, Fakir," answered the King.\n\nThe Fakir said, "Of goods and gold I have no lack, but I will say a prayer for\nyou, and you will have two sons; one of those sons will be mine."\n\nThen he took out two sweetmeats and handed them to the King, and said, "King!\ntake these two sweetmeats and give them to your wives; give them to the wives\nyou love best."\n\nThe King took the sweetmeats and put them in his bosom.\n\nThen the Fakir said, "King! in a year I will return, and of the two sons who\nwill be born to you one is mine and one yours."\n\nThe King said, "Well, I agree."\n\nThen the Fakir went on his way, and the King came home and gave one sweetmeat\nto each of his two wives. After some time two sons were born to the King. Then\nwhat did the King do but place those two sons in an underground room, which he\nhad built in the earth.\n\nSome time passed, and one day the Fakir appeared, and said, "King! bring me\nthat son of yours!"\n\nWhat did the King do but bring two slave-girls\' sons and present them to the\nFakir. While the Fakir was sitting there the King\'s sons were sitting down\nbelow in their cellar eating their food. Just then a hungry ant had carried\naway a grain of rice from their food, and was going along with it to her\nchildren. Another stronger ant came up and attacked her in order to get this\ngrain of rice. The first ant said "O ant, why do you drag this away from me? I\nhave long been lame in my feet, and I have got just one grain, and am carrying\nit to my children. The King\'s sons are sitting in the cellar eating their\nfood; you go and fetch a grain from there; why should you take mine from me?"\nOn this the second ant let go and did not rob the first, but went off to where\nthe King\'s sons were eating their food.\n\nOn hearing this the Fakir said, "King! these are not your sons; go and bring\nthose children who are eating their food in the cellar."\n\nThen the King went and brought his own sons. The Fakir chose the eldest son\nand took him away, and set off with him on his journey. When he got home he\ntold the King\'s son to go out to gather fuel.\n\nSo the King\'s son went out to gather cow-dung, and when be had collected some\nhe brought it in.\n\nThen the Fakir looked at the King\'s son and put on a great pot, and said,\n"Come round here, my pupil."\n\nBut the King\'s son said, "Master first, and pupil after." The Fakir told him\nto come once, he told him twice, he told him three times, and each time the\nKing\'s son answered, "Master first, and pupil after."\n\nThen the Fakir made a dash at the King\'s son, thinking to catch him and throw\nhim into the caldron. There were about a hundred gallons of oil in this\ncaldron, and the fire was burning beneath it. Then the King\'s son, lifting the\nFakir, gave him a jerk and threw him into the caldron, and he was burnt, and\nbecame roast meat. He then saw a key of the Fakir\'s lying there; he took this\nkey and opened the door of the Fakir\'s house. Now many men were locked up in\nthis house; two horses were standing there in a hut of the Fakir\'s; two\ngreyhounds were tied up there; two simurgs were imprisoned, and two tigers\nalso stood there. So the King\'s son let all the creatures go, and took them\nout of the house, and they all returned thanks to God. Next he let out all the\nmen who were in prison. He took away with him the two horses, and he took away\nthe two tigers, and he took away the two hounds, and he took away the two\nsimurgs, and with them be set out for another country.\n\nAs he went along the road he saw above him a bald man, grazing a herd of\ncalves, and this bald man called out to him, "Fellow! can you fight at all?"\n\nThe King\'s son replied, "When I was little I could fight a bit, and now, if\nany one wants to fight, I am not so unmanly as to turn my back. Come, I will\nfight you."\n\nThe bald man said, "If I throw you, you shall be my slave; and if you throw\nme, I will be your slave." So they got ready and began to fight, and the\nKing\'s son threw him.\n\nOn this the King\'s son said, "I will leave my beasts here my simurgs, tigers,\nand dogs, and horses; they will all stay here while I go to the city to see\nthe sights. I appoint the tiger as guard over my property. And you are my\nslave; you, too, must stay here with my belongings." So the King\'s son started\noff to the city to see the sights, and arrived at a pool.\n\nHe saw that it was a pleasant pool, and thought he would stop and bathe there,\nand therewith he began to strip off his clothes.\n\nNow the King\'s daughter, who was sitting on the roof of the palace, saw his\nroyal marks, and she said, "This man is a king; when I marry, I will marry him\nand no other." So she said to her father, "My father; I wish to marry."\n\n"Good," said her father.\n\nThen the King made a proclamation: "Let all men, great and small, attend to-\nday in the hall of audience, for the King\'s daughter will to-day take a\nhusband."\n\nAll the men of the land assembled, and the traveller Prince also came, dressed\nin the Fakir\'s clothes, saying to himself, "I must see this ceremony to-day."\nHe went in and sat down.\n\nThe King\'s daughter came out and sat in the balcony, and cast her glance round\nall the assembly. She noticed that the traveller Prince was sitting in the\nassembly in Fakir\'s attire.\n\nThe Princess said to her handmaiden, "Take this dish of henna, go to that\ntraveller dressed like a Fakir, and sprinkle scent on him from the dish."\n\nThe handmaiden obeyed the Princess\'s order, went to him, and sprinkled the\nscent over him.\n\nThen the people said, "The slave-girl has made a mistake."\n\nBut she replied, "The slave-girl has made no mistake, \'tis her mistress has\nmade the mistake."\n\nOn this the King married his daughter to the Fakir, who was really no Fakir,\nbut a Prince.\n\nWhat fate had decreed came to pass in that country, and they were married. But\nthe King of that city became very sad in his heart, because when so many\nchiefs and nobles were sitting there his daughter had chosen none of them, but\nhad chosen that Fakir; but he kept these thoughts concealed in his heart.\n\nOne day the traveller Prince said, "Let all the King\'s sons-in-law come out\nwith me to-day to hunt."\n\nPeople said, "What is this Fakir that he should go a-hunting?"\n\nHowever, they all set out for the hunt, and fixed their meeting-place at a\ncertain pool.\n\nThe newly-married Prince went to his tigers, and told his tigers and hounds to\nkill and bring in a great number of gazelles and hog-deer and markhor.\nInstantly they killed and brought in a great number. Then taking with him\nthese spoils of the chase, the Prince came to the pool settled on as a\nmeeting-place. The other Princes; sons-in-law of the King of that city, also\nassembled there; but they had brought in no game, and the new Prince bad\nbrought a great deal. Thence they returned home to the town, and went to the\nKing, their father-in-law, to present their game.\n\nNow that King had no son. Then the new Prince told him that in fact he, too,\nwas a Prince. At this the King, his father-in-law, was greatly delighted and\ntook him by the hand and embraced him. He seated him by himself, saying, "O\nPrince, I return thanks that you have come here and become my son-in-law; I am\nvery happy at this, and I make over my kingdom to you."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Why the Fish Laughed](ift25.htm)\n\n'
