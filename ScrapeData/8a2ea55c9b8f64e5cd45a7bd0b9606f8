Should it be said that there is attainment of fruition (of pleasure and\npain); we reply, not so, on account of difference.\n\nBut, if the highest Brahman is assumed to dwell within bodies, like the\nindividual soul, it follows that, like the latter, it is subject to the\nexperience of pleasure and pain, such experience springing from connexion with\nbodies!--Of this objection the Sutra disposes by remarking 'not so, on account\nof difference (of reason).' For what is the cause of experiences, pleasurable\nor painful, is not the mere dwelling within a body, but rather the subjection\nto the influence of good and evil deeds; and such subjection is impossible in\nthe case of the highest Self to which all evil is foreign. Compare the\nscriptural text 'One of the two eats the sweet fruit, the other one looks on\nwithout eating'\n\np. 266\n\n[paragraph continues] (Mu. Up. III, 1, 1).--Here finishes the adhikara _n_ a\nof 'what is known everywhere.'\n\nWell then, if the highest Self is not an enjoyer, we must conclude that\nwherever fruition is referred to, the embodied soul only is meant!--Of this\nview the next adhikara _n_ a disposes.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 9.
