Now those arteries of the heart consist of a brown substance, of a white,\nblue, yellow, and red\n\np. 133\n\nsubstance, and so is the sun brown, white, blue, yellow, and red.\n\n2\\. As a very long highway goes to two places, to one at the beginning, and to\nanother at the end, so do the rays of the sun go to both worlds, to this one\nand to the other. They start from the sun, and enter into those arteries; they\nstart from those arteries, and enter into the sun.\n\n3\\. And when a man is asleep, reposing, and at perfect rest, so that he sees\nno dream 1, then he has entered into those arteries. Then no evil touches him,\nfor he has obtained the light (of the sun).\n\n4\\. And when a man falls ill, then those who sit round him, say, 'Do you know\nme? Do you know me?' As long as he has not departed from this body, he knows\nthem.\n\n5\\. But when he departs from this body, then he departs upwards by those very\nrays (towards the worlds which he has gained by merit, not by knowledge); or\nhe goes out while meditating on Om 2 (and thus securing an entrance into the\nBrahmaloka).\n\np. 134\n\nAnd while his mind is failing, he is going to the sun. For the sun is the door\nof the world (of Brahman). Those who know, walk in; those who do not know, are\nshut out. There is this verse [1](sbe01167.htm#fn_340): 'There are a hundred\nand one arteries of the heart; one of them penetrates the crown of the head;\nmoving upwards by it a man reaches the immortal; the others serve for\ndeparting in different directions, yea, in different directions\n[2](sbe01167.htm#fn_341).'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[133:1](sbe01166.htm#fr_340) Svapna in Sanskrit is both somnus and somnium.\nHence one might translate also, 'so that he is not aware that he is asleep,'\nwhich in some respects would seem even more appropriate in our passage; cf.\nVIII, 11, 1.\n\n[133:2](sbe01166.htm#fr_341) According to the explanation given of the Om in\nthe Upanishads, and more particularly in the Dahara-vidya contained in this\nPrapa _th_ aka.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 7](sbe01167.htm)\n\n"
