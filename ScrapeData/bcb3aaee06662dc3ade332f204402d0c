He must not bathe in another man's pool;\n\n2\\. In cases of distress (if there is no other water at hand) he may bathe (in\nanother man's pool), after having offered up five (or seven, or four) lumps of\nclay and (three jars with) water.\n\n3\\. (He must not bathe) during an indigestion;\n\n4\\. Nor while he is afflicted (with a fever or other illness);\n\n5\\. Nor without his clothes; 6. Nor at night; 7. Unless it be during an\neclipse; 8. Nor in the twilight.\n\n9, He must bathe early in the morning, when he beholds the east reddening with\nthe rays of the (rising) sun.\n\n10\\. After having bathed, he must not shake his head (in order to remove the\nwater from his hair);\n\n11\\. And he must not dry his limbs (with his hand or with a cloth);\n\n12\\. Nor must he touch any oily substance.\n\n[LXIV. I. M. IV, 201.--1, 2. Y. I, 159-3, 4. M. IV, 129.--5. M. IV, 45; Gaut.\nIX, 61; \xc3\x82 _s_ v. III, 9, 6; Par. II, 7, 6; _S_ a _n_ kh. IV, 12, 31.--6. M.\nIV, 129.--12. M. IV, 83.--13, _S_ a _n_ kh. IV, 12, 32.--15. Gaut. IX, 16.--\n16. M. IV, 263; Y. I, 159.--24. M. IV, 152; Y. I, 100.--27. Y. I, 196.\n\n5\\. The term nagna, literally 'naked,' has to be taken in its widest sense\nhere. According to Bh _ri_ gu and Gobhila it includes, besides one wholly\nundressed, 'one without his upper garment, one who has dirty clothes on, one\nclad in lower garments of silk only, one who wears double clothing or even a\ngreater number of clothes, one who wears a small piece of cloth over the\npudenda only,' &c. (Nand.) See also M. IV, 129.]\n\np. 205\n\n13\\. He must not put on again the garment which he wore before, without its\nhaving been washed.\n\n14\\. After having bathed, he must cover with his head a turban[1] and put on\ntwo garments[2] washed (by himself).\n\n15\\. He must not converse, (after having bathed,) with barbarians, low-caste\npersons, or outcasts.\n\n16\\. He must bathe in cascades, ponds dug by the gods, and lakes.\n\n17\\. Stagnant water is more pure (and purifies more effectually) than water\ntaken out (of a well or the like); the water of a spring is more pure than\nthat of a tank; the water of a river is more pure than the former; water\ncollected by (Vasish _th_ a or some other) devout sage[1] is even more pure;\nbut the water of the Ganges is the purest of all.\n\n19\\. After having removed the dirt by means of earth and water[1], and after\nhaving dived under water and returned (to the bank of the river), he must\naddress the bathing-place with the three Mantras (beginning with the words),\n'Ye waters are[2],'with the four Mantras (beginning with the words),\n\n[14. 1 Ush _n_ isha, 'a turban,' here denotes a bandage used for drying the\nhead, which is wrapped around the head and closely tied together.--2 I. e. an\nupper and an under garment. (Nand.)\n\n16\\. The term devakhata, 'ponds dug by the gods,' refers to Pushkara and other\nholy bathing-places. (Nand.) See below LXXXV.\n\n17\\. 1 Nand. cites Vasish _th_ apraki and Vi _s_ vamitrapra _k_ i as instances\nof holy bathing-places of this description.\n\n18\\. 1 Nand. refers this and the following Sutras to a midday bath, because a\nverse, which he quotes, forbids the use of earth (in order to clean one's self\nwith it) in the morning bath. But it seems to follow from 35 and 42, that an\nthe rules given in this chapter refer to that bath, which must be taken at\nsunrise every day.--2 Rig {footnote p. 206} veda X, 9, 1-3, &c.--3 Taitt. Sa\n_m_ h. V, 6, 1, 1-2, &c.--4 Rig-veda I, 23, 22, &c.]\n\np. 206\n\n'The golden-coloured (waters)[3],' and with (the one Mantra beginning with the\nwords), 'Carry away (all), that, O ye waters[4].'\n\n19\\. Then he must dive underwater and mutter the Aghamarshana three times;\n\n20\\. Or (he must mutter three times the Mantra which begins with the words),\n'That most exalted step of Vish _n_ u;'\n\n21\\. Or the Drupada Savitri (which begins with the words, 'Like one released\nfrom a post);\n\n22\\. Or the Anuvaka (which begins with the words), 'They get their minds\nready;'\n\n23\\. Or the Purushasukta.\n\n24\\. After having bathed, he must feed the gods and the manes, while standing\nin the water with his wet clothes on.\n\n25\\. If (being unable to remain in water after having bathed) he has changed\nhis dress, (he must feed the gods and the manes,) after having crossed the\nbathing-place (and reached the bank).\n\n26\\. (But) he must not wring his bathing-dress till he has satisfied the gods\nand the manes.\n\n2 7. After having bathed[1] and sipped water, he must sip water (once more)\naccording to the rule.\n\n28\\. He must offer (sixteen) flowers to Purusha,\n\n[20. Rig-veda I, 22, 20, &c.\n\n21\\. Taitt. Brahm. II, 4, 4, 9; 6, 6, 3; cf. Va _g_ asan. Sa _m_ h. XX, 20;\nAtharva-veda VI, 115, 3.\n\n22\\. Rig-veda V, 81, &c.\n\n24\\. 'The use of the particle _k_ a indicates that he must anoint himself\nafter having bathed.' (Nand.)\n\n27\\. 'This expression refers back to the whole proceeding described above, up\nto the wringing of the bathing-dress. (Nand.)]\n\np. 207\n\nwhile muttering the Purushasukta, one with each verse.\n\n29\\. Afterwards (he must offer) a libation of water.\n\n30\\. He must first offer one to the gods with the Tirtha sacred to the gods.\n\n31\\. Then he must offer an other to the manes with the Tirtha sacred to the\nmanes.\n\n32\\. In offering the latter he must first of all feed (the manes of) his next\nof kin (such as his father, mother, maternal grandfather, uncles, brothers,\n&c.)\n\n33\\. After that (he must feed) his relatives (such as a sister's son, a\nfather-in-law, a brother-in-law, &c.) and distant kinsmen (such as the sons of\nhis father's sisters and of his mother's sisters).\n\n34\\. Then (he must feed) his (deceased) friends.\n\n35\\. According, to the above rule he must bathe every day.\n\n36\\. After having bathed, he must mutter as many purifying Mantras as\npossible.\n\n37\\. And he must mutter the Gayatri even more often (than other Mantras);\n\n38\\. And the Purushasukta.\n\n39\\. There is nothing more sublime than those two (prayers).\n\n40\\. One who has bathed is thereby entitled to perform the offerings to the Vi\n_s_ vedevas and to the manes, to mutter sacred texts, and to exercise the duty\nof hospitality, as prescribed by law.\n\n[30, 31. See LXII, 3, 4.\n\n37, 38. 'Or the meaning of these two Sutras is, that the Gayatri and the\nPurushasukta always have to be muttered besides the other Mantras.' (Nand.)\n\n40\\. Nand. refers the term vidhinodite to a separate duty, that {footnote p.\n208} of worshipping the gods; the particle _k_ a to the propitiation of the\nplanets by sacrifices and other such duties; and the particle tatha to\noptional acts, such as the gift of a cow to a Brahma _n_ a, and the like. But\nthis is certainly a too extensive interpretation of the text.]\n\np. 208\n\n41\\. Distress and misfortune, bad dreams and evil thoughts are taken from him\neven who only sprinkles himself with water (no matter from where it comes):\nthat is the law.\n\n42\\. He who regularly takes the prescribed bath (every morning), does not\nexperience the tortures of Yama's hell. By the regular bath criminals even\nobtain their absolution.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: LXV.](sbe07067.htm)\n\n"
