They speak of an eternal Ashvattha rooted above and branching below, whose\nleaves are the Vedas; he who knows it, is a Veda-knower. 1\n\np. 324\n\n2\\. Below and above spread its branches, nourished by the Gunas; sense-objects\nare its buds; and below in the world of man stretch forth the roots,\n[originating](errata.htm#2) action. 2\n\np. 325\n\n3-4. Its form is not here perceived as such, neither its end, nor its origin,\nnor its\n\np. 326\n\nexistence. Having cut asunder this firm-rooted Ashvattha with the strong axe\nof non-attachment,--then that Goal is to be sought for, going whither they\n(the wise) do not return again. I seek refuge in that Primeval Purusha whence\nstreamed forth the Eternal Activity. 3\n\np. 327\n\n5\\. Free from pride and delusion, with the evil of attachment conquered, ever\ndwelling in the Self, with desires completely receded, liberated from the\npairs of opposites known as pleasure and pain, the undeluded reach that Goal\nEternal.\n\n6\\. That the sun illumines not, nor the moon, nor fire; that is My Supreme\nAbode, going whither they return not.\n\n7\\. An eternal portion of Myself having become a living soul in the world of\nlife, draws (to itself) the (five) senses\n\np. 328\n\nwith mind for the sixth, abiding in Prakriti. 7\n\n8\\. When the Lord obtains a body and when He leaves it, He takes these and\ngoes, as the wind takes the scents from their seats (the flowers). 8\n\np. 329\n\n9\\. Presiding over the ear, the eye, the touch, the taste and the smell, as\nalso the mind, He experiences objects.\n\n10\\. Him while transmigrating from one body to another, or residing (in the\nsame) or experiencing, or when united with the Gunas,--the deluded do not see;\nbut those who have the eye of wisdom behold Him. 10\n\np. 330\n\n11\\. The Yogis striving (for perfection) behold Him dwelling in themselves;\nbut the unrefined and unintelligent, even though striving, see Him not. 11\n\n12\\. The light which, residing in the sun illumines the whole world, that\nwhich is in the moon and in the fire--know that light to be Mine. 12\n\np. 331\n\n13\\. Entering the earth with My energy, I support all beings, and I nourish\nall the herbs, becoming the watery moon. 13\n\n14\\. Abiding in the body of living beings as (the fire) Vaishvanara, I,\nassociated with Prana and Apana, digest the fourfold food. 14\n\np. 332\n\n15\\. I am centred in the hearts of all; memory and perception as well as their\nloss come from Me. I am verily that which has to be known by all the Vedas, I\nindeed am the Author of the Vedanta, and the Knower of the Veda am I. 15\n\np. 333\n\n16\\. There are two Purushas in the world,--the Perishable and the\nImperishable. All beings are the Perishable; and the Kutastha is called\nImperishable. 16\n\np. 334\n\n17\\. But (there is) another, the Supreme Purusha, called the Highest Self, the\nimmutable Lord, who pervading the three worlds, sustains them. 17\n\n18\\. As I transcend the Perishable and am above even the Imperishable,\ntherefore am I in the world and in the Veda celebrated as the Purushottama,\n(the Highest Purusha). 18\n\np. 335\n\n19\\. He who free from delusion thus knows Me, the Highest Spirit, he knowing\nall, worships Me with all his heart, O descendant of Bharata.\n\n20\\. Thus, O sinless one, has this most profound teaching been imparted by Me.\nKnowing this one attains the highest intelligence\n\np. 336\n\nand will have accomplished all one\'s duties, O descendant of Bharata. 20\n\n\n\nThe end of the fifteenth chapter designated: The Way to the Supreme Spirit.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[323:1](sbg20.htm#fr_317) _Ashvattha:_ literally, that which does not endure\ntill to-morrow: the Samsara, the ever-changing, phenomenal world.\n\nBrahman with Its unmanifested energy Maya, is spoken of as the One "above,"\nfor It is supreme over all things; the One above is the root of this Tree of\nSamsara, as such it is said to have its root above. Mahat, Ahamkara Tanmatras,\netc., are its branches p. 342 evolving to grosser and grosser states--hence it\nis said to be branching " _below_." As leaves protect a tree, so do the Vedas\nprotect the Tree of Samsara, as treating of Dharma and Adharma, with their\ncauses and fruits.\n\n_Eternal_ --because this Tree of Samsara rests on a continuous series of\nbirths without beginning and end, and it cannot be cut down except by the\nknowledge, "I am Brahman."\n\n[324:2](sbg20.htm#fr_318) _Below:_ from man downwards.\n\n_Above:_ up to Brahma.\n\n_Roots:_ The tap-root is the Lord "above"; the p. 325 secondary roots are the\nSamskaras, attachment and aversion etc. It is these that, being in perpetual\nsuccession the cause and consequence of good and evil deeds, bind one fast to\nactions--Dharma and Adharma.\n\n[326:3](sbg20.htm#fr_319) _As such:_ it cannot be said to exist, because it\nappears and vanishes every other moment. See commentary on II. 16.\n\n_Tat_ --That--Sankara and Anandagiri read \'Tatah,\' and explain it as beyond or\nabove the Ashvattha, the Tree of Samsara.\n\n_The Eternal Activity:_ this ever-passing work of projection, this ever-\nflowing current of evolution, the world of phenomena.\n\n[328:7](sbg20.htm#fr_320) The Jiva or the individual soul is that aspect of\nthe Supreme Self which manifests itself in every one as the doer and enjoyer,\nbeing limited by the Upadhis set up by Avidya; but in reality, both are the\nsame. It is like the Akasha (space) in the jar, which is a portion of the\ninfinite Akasha, and becomes one with the latter on the destruction of the\njar, the cause of limitation.\n\n[328:8](sbg20.htm#fr_321) _Lord:_ Jiva spoken of in the preceding Sloka.\n\nWhen the Jiva leaves the body, then he draws round himself the senses and the\nManas. When he enters another he takes these again with him, _i.e._ , he is\nborn with these again.\n\n[329:10](sbg20.htm#fr_322) Though Atman is nearest and comes most easily\nwithin the range of their consciousness in a variety of functions, still all\ndo not see Him, because of their complete subservience to sense-objects.\n\n[330:11](sbg20.htm#fr_323) _The unrefined:_ Whose mind has not been\nregenerated by Tapas and subjugation of the senses, whose mind is not\npurified.\n\n[330:12](sbg20.htm#fr_324) _Light_ --may also be understood to mean the light\nof consciousness.\n\n[331:13](sbg20.htm#fr_325) _Energy_ --Ojas: The energy of the Ishvara, whereby\nthe vast heaven and the earth are firmly held.\n\n_Nourish_ --by infusing sap into them.\n\n_The watery moon:_ The Soma, moon, is considered as the repository or the\nembodiment of all fluids (Rasas.)\n\n[331:14](sbg20.htm#fr_326) p. 331 See IV. 29.\n\n_Vaishv anara:_ The fire abiding in the stomach.\n\n_Fourfold food:_ Food which has to be eaten by (1) mastication, (2) sucking,\n(3) licking, and (4):swallowing.\n\n[332:15](sbg20.htm#fr_327) _Memory_ --of what is experienced in the past\nbirths; and _knowledge_ --of things transcending the ordinary limits of space,\ntime and visible nature.-- _Anandagiri_. p. 333\n\n_Come from Me_ --as the result of their good or evil deeds.\n\n_I indeed . . . Ved anta:_ It is I who am the Teacher of the wisdom of the\nVedanta, and cause it to be handed down in regular succession.\n\n[333:16](sbg20.htm#fr_328) _Two Purushas:_ Two categories--arranged in, two\nseparate groups of beings,--spoken of as: \'Purushas,\' as they are the Upadhis\nof the Purusha.\n\n_Imperishable_ --Maya-Sakti of the Lord, the germ from which the perishable\nbeing takes its birth.\n\n_Kutastha:_ That which manifests Itself in various forms of illusion and\ndeception. It is said to be imperishable, as the seed of Samsara is endless,--\nin the sense that it does not perish in the absence of Brahma-Jnana.\n\n[334:17](sbg20.htm#fr_329) _Another:_ quite distinct from the two.\n\n_The three Worlds:_ Bhuh (the Earth), Bhuvah (the Mid-Region) and Svah (the\nHeaven).\n\n[334:18](sbg20.htm#fr_330) p. 335 _The Perishable_ --The Tree of Samsara\ncalled Ashvattha.\n\n_The Imperishable_ --Which constitutes the seed of the Tree of Samsara.\n\n[336:20](sbg20.htm#fr_331) _Highest intelligence_ --which realises the\nBrahman.\n\n_Will have accomplished . . . duties:_ Whatever duty one has to do in life,\nall that duty has been done, when the Brahman is realised.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Sixteenth Chapter.
