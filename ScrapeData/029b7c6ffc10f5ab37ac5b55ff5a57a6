Flesh is of earthy nature; in the case of the two others also according\nto the text.\n\nThe view that the description of tripartition, given in the passage 'each of\nthese he made tripartite,' refers to a time subsequent to the creation of the\nmundane egg and to the gods created by Brahma, cannot be upheld. For from it\nthere would follow that, as in the passage 'earth when eaten is disposed of in\nthree ways,' &c., flesh is declared to be more subtle than feces, and mind yet\nsubtler, it would have to be assumed--in agreement with the nature of the\ncausal substance--that flesh is made of water and manas of fire 1. And\nsimilarly we should have to assume that urine\n\np. 582\n\n[paragraph continues] \\--which is the grossest part of water drunk (cp. VI, 5,\n2)--is of the nature of earth, and breath, which is its subtlest part, of the\nnature of fire. But this is not admissible; for as the text explicitly states\nthat earth when eaten is disposed of in three ways, flesh and mind also must\nbe assumed to be of an earthy nature. In the same way we must frame our view\nconcerning 'the two others,' i.e. water and fire, 'according to the text.'\nThat means--the three parts into which water divides itself when drunk, must\nbe taken to be all of them modifications of water, and the three parts of fire\nwhen consumed must be held to be all of them modifications of fire. Thus\nfeces, flesh and mind are alike transformations of earth; urine, blood and\nbreath transformations of water; bones, marrow and speech transformations of\nfire.\n\nThis moreover agrees with the subsequent statement (VI, 5, 4), 'For, truly,\nmind consists of earth, breath of water, speech of fire.' The process of\ntripartition referred to in VI, 3, 4, is not therefore the same as the one\ndescribed in the section that tells us what becomes of food when eaten, water\nwhen drunk, &c. Were this (erroneous) assumption made, and were it thence\nconcluded that mind, breath and speech--as being the subtlest created things--\nare made of fire, this would flatly contradict the complementary text quoted\nabove ('mind consists of earth,' &c.). When the text describes how earth,\nwater and fire, when eaten, are transformed in a threefold way, it refers to\nelements which had already been rendered tripartite; the process of\ntripartition must therefore have taken place before the creation of the cosmic\negg. Without such tripartition the elements would be incapable of giving rise\nto any effects; such capability they acquire only by being mutually conjoined,\nand that is just the process of tripartition. In agreement herewith Sm _ri_ ti\nsays, 'Separate from each other, without connexion, those elements with their\nvarious powers were incapable of producing creatures. Bul having combined\ncompletely, entered into mutual conjunction, abiding one within the other, the\nprinciples--from the highest Mahat down to\n\np. 583\n\nindividual things--produced the mundane egg.'--When the text therefore says\n(VI, 3, 3) 'The divinity having entered into those three beings with that\nsoul-self differentiated names and forms; he made each of these tripartite,'\nthe order in which the text mentions the activities of differentiation and\ntripartition is refuted by the order demanded by the sense 1.--The text then\nproceeds to exemplify the process of tripartition, by means of burning fire,\nthe sun and lightning, which indeed are things contained within the mundane\negg (while yet the tripartition of elements took place before the egg, with\nall its contents, was created); but this is done for the information of _S_\nvetaketu, who himself is a being within the mundane egg, and has to be taught\nwith reference to things he knows.\n\nBut, a final objection is raised, as on this view of the matter the elements--\nearth, water and fire--which are eaten and drunk, are already tripartite, each\nof them containing portions of all, and thus are of a threefold nature, how\ncan they be designated each of them by a simple term-- _earth_ , _water_ ,\n_fire_?--To this the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[581:1](sbe48316.htm#fr_40) I.e. if the tripartition of earth (i. e. solid\nfood) when eaten, which is described in VI, 5, 1, were the same tripartition\nwhich is described in VI, 3, 3-4, we should have to conclude that the former\ntripartition consists, like the latter, in an admixture to earth of water and\nfire.\n\n[583:1](sbe48316.htm#fr_41) That means--in reality the tripartition of the\nelements came first, and after that the creation of individual beings.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 19.
