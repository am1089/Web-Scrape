There are three branches of the law. Sacrifice, study, and charity are the\nfirst 1,\n\n2\\. Austerity the second, and to dwell as a Brahma _k_ arin in the house of a\ntutor, always mortifying the body in the house of a tutor, is the third. All\nthese obtain the worlds of the blessed; but the Brahmasa _m_ stha alone (he\nwho is firmly grounded in Brahman) obtains immortality.\n\n3\\. Pra _g_ apati brooded on the worlds. From them, thus brooded on, the\nthreefold knowledge (sacrifice) issued forth. He brooded on it, and from it,\nthus brooded on, issued the three syllables, Bhu _h_ , Bhuva _h_ , Sva _h_.\n\n4\\. He brooded on them, and from them, thus brooded on, issued the Om. As all\nleaves are attached to a stalk, so is all speech (all words) attached to the\nOm (Brahman). Om is all this, yea, Om is all this.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[35:1](sbe01057.htm#fr_157) Not the first in rank or succession, but only in\nenumerating the three branches of the law. This first branch corresponds to\nthe second stage, the a _s_ rama of the householder. Austerity is meant for\nthe Vanaprastha, the third a _s_ rama, while the third is intended for the\nBrahma _k_ arin, the student, only that the naish _th_ ika or perpetual Brahma\n_k_ arin here takes the place of the ordinary student. The Brahmasa _m_ stha\nwould represent the fourth a _s_ rama, that of the Sannyasin or parivra _g_ ,\nwho has ceased to perform any works, even the tapas or austerities of the\nVanaprastha.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 24](sbe01058.htm)\n\n'
