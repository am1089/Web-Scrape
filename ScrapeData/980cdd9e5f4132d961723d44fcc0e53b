And because it is directly stated in Scripture (therefore the all-knowing\nBrahman is the cause of the world).\n\nThat the all-knowing Lord is the cause of the world, is also declared in a\ntext directly referring to him (viz. the all-knowing one), viz. in the\nfollowing passage of the mantropanishad of the _S_ veta _s_ vataras (VI, 9)\nwhere the word 'he' refers to the previously mentioned all-knowing Lord, 'He\nis the cause, the lord of the lords of the organs, and there is of him neither\nparent nor lord.' It is therefore finally settled that the all-knowing Brahman\nis the general cause, not the non-intelligent pradhana or anything else.\n\nIn what precedes we have shown, availing ourselves of appropriate arguments,\nthat the Vedanta-texts exhibited under Sutras I, I-II, are capable of proving\nthat the all-knowing, all-powerful Lord is the cause of the origin,\nsubsistence, and dissolution of the world. And we have explained, by pointing\nto the prevailing uniformity of view (I, 10), that all Vedanta-texts whatever\nmaintain an intelligent cause. The question might therefore be asked, 'What\nreason is there for the subsequent part of the Vedanta-sutras?' (as the chief\npoint is settled already.)\n\nTo this question we reply as follows: Brahman is apprehended under two forms;\nin the first place as qualified by limiting conditions owing to the\nmultiformity of the evolutions of name and form (i.e. the multiformity of the\ncreated world; in the second place as being the opposite of this, i.e. free\nfrom all limiting conditions whatever. Compare\n\np. 62\n\nthe following passages: B _ri_. Up. IV, 5, 15, 'For where there is duality as\nit were, then one sees the other; but when the Self only is all this, how\nshould he see another?' _Kh_. Up. VII, 24, 1, 'Where one sees nothing else,\nhears nothing else, understands nothing else, that is the greatest. Where one\nsees something else, hears something else, understands something else, that is\nthe little. The greatest is immortal; the little is mortal;' Taitt. \xc3\x82r. III,\n12, 7, 'The wise one, who having produced all forms and made all names, sits\ncalling (the things by their names 1);' _S_ v. Up. VI, 19, 'Who is without\nparts, without actions, tranquil, without faults, without taint, the highest\nbridge of immortality, like a fire that has consumed its fuel;' B _ri_. Up.\nII, 3, 6, 'Not so, not so;' B _ri_. Up. III, 8, 8, 'It is neither coarse nor\nfine, neither short nor long;' and 'defective is one place, perfect the\nother.' All these passages, with many others, declare Brahman to possess a\ndouble nature, according as it is the object either of Knowledge or of\nNescience. As long as it is the object of Nescience, there are applied to it\nthe categories of devotee, object of devotion, and the like 2. The different\nmodes of devotion lead to different results, some to exaltation, some to\ngradual emancipation, some to success in works; those modes are distinct on\naccount of the distinction of the different qualities and limiting conditions\n3. And although the one highest Self only, i.e. the Lord distinguished by\nthose different qualities constitutes the object of devotion, still the fruits\n(of devotion) are distinct, according as the devotion refers to different\nqualities. Thus Scripture says, 'According as man worships him, that he\nbecomes;' and, 'According to what his thought is in this world, so will he be\nwhen he has departed\n\np. 63\n\nthis life' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 14, 1). Sm _ri_ ti also makes an analogous\nstatement, 'Remembering whatever form of being he leaves this body in the end,\ninto that form he enters, being impressed with it through his constant\nmeditation' (Bha. Gita VIII, 6).\n\nAlthough one and the same Self is hidden in all beings movable as well as\nimmovable, yet owing to the gradual rise of excellence of the minds which form\nthe limiting conditions (of the Self), Scripture declares that the Self,\nalthough eternally unchanging and uniform, reveals itself 1 in a graduated\nseries of beings, and so appears in forms of various dignity and power;\ncompare, for instance (Ait. \xc3\x82r. II, 3, 2, 1), 'He who knows the higher\nmanifestation of the Self in him 2,' &c. Similarly Sm _ri_ ti remarks,\n'Whatever being there is of power, splendour or might, know it to have sprung\nfrom portions of my glory' (Bha. Gita, X, 41); a passage declaring that\nwherever there is an excess of power and so on, there the Lord is to be\nworshipped. Accordingly here (i.e. in the Sutras) also the teacher will show\nthat the golden person in the disc of the Sun is the highest Self, on account\nof an indicating sign, viz. the circumstance of his being unconnected with any\nevil (Ved. Su. I, 1, 20); the same is to be observed with regard to I, 1, 22\nand other Sutras. And, again, an enquiry will have to be undertaken into the\nmeaning of the texts, in order that a settled conclusion may be reached\nconcerning that knowledge of the Self which leads to instantaneous release;\nfor although that knowledge is conveyed by means of various limiting\nconditions, yet no special connexion with limiting conditions is intended to\nbe intimated, in consequence of which there arises a doubt whether it (the\n\np. 64\n\nknowledge) has the higher or the lower Brahman for its object; so, for\ninstance, in the case of Sutra I, 1, 12 1. From all this it appears that the\nfollowing part of the _S_ astra has a special object of its own, viz. to show\nthat the Vedanta-texts teach, on the one hand, Brahman as connected with\nlimiting conditions and forming an object of devotion, and on the other hand,\nas being free from the connexion with such conditions and constituting an\nobject of knowledge. The refutation, moreover, of non-intelligent causes\ndifferent from Brahman, which in I, 1, 10 was based on the uniformity of the\nmeaning of the Vedanta-texts, will be further detailed by the Sutrakara, who,\nwhile explaining additional passages relating to Brahman, will preclude all\ncauses of a nature opposite to that of Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[62:1](sbe34017.htm#fr_104) The wise one, i.e. the highest Self; which as _g_\nivatman is conversant with the names and forms of individual things.\n\n[62:2](sbe34017.htm#fr_105) I.e. it is looked upon as the object of the\ndevotion of the individual souls; while in reality all those souls and Brahman\nare one.\n\n[62:3](sbe34017.htm#fr_106) Qualities, i.e. the attributes under which the\nSelf is meditated on; limiting conditions, i.e. the localities--such as the\nheart and the like--which in pious meditation are ascribed to the Self.\n\n[63:1](sbe34017.htm#fr_107) \xc3\x82nanda Giri reads avish _t_ asya for avishk _ri_\ntasya.\n\n[63:2](sbe34017.htm#fr_108) Cp. the entire passage.
