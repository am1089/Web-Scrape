LEADBEATER OFF THE TRAIL\n\nThe harm to Yoga philosophy that has been done by misinformation thru the\n"Theosophist" Rev. C. W. Leadbeater is indeed very great.\n\nMost readers of Theosophical and Occult literature believe Rev. Leadbeater to\nbe a friend to the Hindus, but after reading his book, "The Inner Life" and\n"The Chakras", I am forced to say by the information he has given, he is the\ngreatest enemy of Yoga philosophy, and has given a bad name to Yoga. This may\nhave been done unconsciously. Nevertheless, it is hard to believe, as in "The\nChakras" he in no instance has corrected the misinformation made in "The Inner\nLife". For example. in "The Chakras" he tries to prove a difference in the\npetals of the different centers from that which is given in Yoga philosophy.\n\nAccording to Rev. Leadbeater all the Yogis of the past and present, even the\nfounder of Yoga philosophy are wrong about the Chakras, and their petals.\n\nAll Yogis and our books claim Sahasrara, has one thousand petals but in one of\nhis\n\np. 147\n\nchapters, Rev. Leadbeater says he found there were only Nine Hundred and Sixty\nand not \'One Thousand\'. The Ajna Chakra has two petals, according to Yoga, but\nRev. Leadbeater claims he found Ninety-six petals in the Ajna Chakra. All his\ncounts are opposite the Yogis\' Chakras, except one. He claims he found Nine\nHundred and Sixty and [Ninety-six](errata.htm#39).\n\nEvery Yogi cannot help but laugh, because there are really no petals at all. I\nwill explain here, the symbols these petals stand for.\n\nEvery Yogi knows, and the students of Yoga Philosophy know, that Rev.\nLeadbeater is \'off the trail,\' and did not stop to consider the origin of our\nOne Thousand Petals. but undoubtedly he had something else in mind.\n\nIn Yoga Philosophy these Chakras are symbols; the first--Earth, the second--\nWater. third-Fire, fourth--Air, fifth--Ether and sixth--Mental. The \'Thousand-\nPetaled\' we do not call a Chakra, as it is above the nature element and mind.\n\nIn these six symbols we have the \'Garland of Letters\', as there are fifty\nletters in the Sanskrit alphabet and each petal of these\n\np. 148\n\ncenters represent a letter. In the first or Root Chakra, Yoga puts four\npetals, six in the second, ten in the third, twelve in the fourth, sixteen in\nthe fifth and two in the sixth, between the eyes. That includes the occult\nsymbol of the Sanskrit alphabet. By [repeating](errata.htm#40) all of the\nfifty alphabetical letters twenty times we have One Thousand--the symbol of\nthe \'Thousand-petals\'. We would like to know just where Rev. Leadbeater gets\nhis idea that there are only 960. Now is he not off the trail, reader?\n\nNow I will give you his own words about awakening the Kundalini: "One very\ncommon effect of rousing it prematurely is that it rushes downwards in the\nbody instead of upwards, and thus excites the most undesirable passions--\nexcites them and intensifies their effects to such a degree that it becomes\nimpossible for the man to resist them. because a force has been brought into\nplay, in whose presence he is as helpless as a swimmer before the jaws of a\nshark".\n\nThe reader will find this kind of stuff in Chapter Four and in the next\nChapter he contradicts as follows: "It is said in some cases Kundalini has\nbeen awakened not only by the will, but also by an accident; by a\n\np. 149\n\nblow or by physical pressure. I heard recently from one of our Theosophical\nlecturers that he had come across an example of the kind when touring in\nCanada. A lady, who knew nothing at all of these matters fell down the cellar\nsteps in her house. She lay for some time unconscious, and when she awoke she\nfound herself clairvoyant, able to read the thoughts passing in other people\'s\nminds, and to see what was going on in every room in the house; and this\nclairvoyance has remained a permanent possession. One assumes that in this\ncase in falling, the lady must have received a blow at the base of the spine\nexactly in such a position and of such a nature as to shock the Kundalini into\npartial activity."\n\nThe miseries and dangers spoken of in the previous chapter, do not appear to\nhave been monstrous in this case.\n\nI will now show my readers at what Rev. Leadbeater is driving. And he does not\nhesitate, if, at the same time he gives a bad name to the Yoga Philosophy,\nbecause he wants followers of his method of opening the Kundalini, and really\none can hardly blame Rev. Leadbeater, as it seems to be the custom of the West\nto first give the other man a bad\n\np. 150\n\nname and then, seek his followers. For nearly half a century I have met Master\nYogis who have awakened their Kundalini and not in a single instance did they\nclaim they had opened it. Rev. Leadbeater is the first man to come to my\nattention, who claims he has opened his Kundalini. For the rest of the people\nhe says: "but most people cannot gain it during the present incarnation, if it\nis the first in which they have begun to take these matters seriously in hand,\nbut it is really for the majority, the work of a later round altogether. The\nconquest of the serpent-fire has to be repeated in each incarnation, since the\nvehicles are new each time, but after it has been once thoroughly achieved\nthese repetitions will be an easy matter." Then on the same page he gives his\nown personal experience: "It may be of use if I mention my own experience in\nthis matter. In the earlier part of my residence in India forty years ago I\nmade no effort to rouse the fire, not indeed knowing very much about it, and\nhaving the opinion that, in order to do anything with it, it was necessary to\nbe born with a specially psychic body, which I did not possess. But one day\none of the Masters made a suggestion to me\n\np. 151\n\nwith regard to a certain kind of meditation which would evoke this force.\nNaturally I at once put the suggestion into practice, and in course of time\nwas successful. I have no doubt, however, that He watched the experiment, and\nwould have checked me if it had become dangerous. I am told that there are\nIndian ascetics who teach this to their pupils, of course keeping them under\ncareful supervision during the process. But I do not my self know of any such,\nnor would I have confidence in them unless they were specially recommended by\nsomeone whom I knew to be possessed of real knowledge."\n\nRev. Leadbeater claims he has opened the Kundalini, still he will not have the\nconfidence in the Hindu Master, unless they were specially recommended by some\nghost on the Astral Plane. Following, I will show how he wants you to open the\nKundalini: "People often ask me what I advise them to do with regard to the\narousing of this force. I advise them to do exactly what I myself did. I\nrecommend them to throw themselves into theosophical work and wait until they\nreceive a definite command from some Master who will undertake to superintend\ntheir psychic development, continuing\n\np. 152\n\nin the meantime all the ordinary exercises of meditation that are known to\nthem. They should not care in the least whether such development comes in this\nincarnation or in the next, but should regard the matter from the point of\nview of the ego and not of the personality, feeling absolutely certain that\nthe Masters are always watching for those whom They can help, that it is\nentirely impossible for anyone to be overlooked, and that They will\nunquestionably give Their directions when They think that the right time has\ncome."\n\nIt would really be a great joy to all Yogis if, Rev. Leadbeater will leave the\nYoga Philosophy alone and give to the world what he wants, but by all means,\ncall it by some other name.\n\nThis is not a pleasure to me to criticise some other writer, but I believe it\nis the duty of every Yogi, to give to those who are seeking information, only\nthat which he (the Yogi) knows to be correct about the Kundalini--the Mother\nof the Universe.\n\nThe following is an article on the same subject, by Arthur Avalon. He, too,\nquestions Rev. Leadbeater\'s remarks.\n\np. 153\n\n#### From pp. 6 to 18\n\n#### Mr. A. Avalon\'s, "The Serpent Power."\n\n"We may here notice the account of a well-known "Theosophical" author (Mr. C.\nW. Leadbeater), regarding what he calls the "Force Centres" and the "Serpent\nFire," of which he writes that he has had [personal](errata.htm#41)\nexperience. Though Mr. Leadbeater also refers to the Yoga Shastra, it may\nperhaps exclude error if we here point out that his account does not profess\nto be a representation of the teaching of the Indian Yogis (whose competence\nfor their own Yoga the author somewhat disparages), but that it is put forward\nas the Author\'s own original explanation (fortified, as he conceives, by\ncertain portions of Indian teaching) of the personal experience which (he\nwrites) he himself has had. This experience appears to consist in the\nconscious arousing of the "Serpent Fire," 1 with the enhanced "astral" and\nmental vision which he believes has shown him what he tells us. 2\n\np. 154\n\n[paragraph continues] The centres, or Chakras, of the human body are by Mr.\nLeadbeater described to be vortices of "etheric" matter 3 into which rush from\nthe "astral" 4 world, and at right angles to the plane of the whirling disc,\nthe sevenfold force of the Logos bringing "divine life" into the physical\nbody. Though all these seven forces operate on all the centres, in each of\nthem one form of the force is greatly predominant. These inrushing forces are\nalleged to set up on the surface of the "etheric double" 5a secondary forces\nat right angles to themselves. The primary force on entrance into the vortex\nradiates again in straight lines, but at right angles. The number of these\nradiations of the primal force is said to determine the number of "petals" 6\n(as the Hindus call them) which the "Lotus" or vortex exhibits. The secondary\nforce rushing round the vortex produces, it is said, the appearance of the\npetals of a flower, or, "perhaps more accurately, saucers or shallow vases of\nwavy iridescent glass". In this way--that is, by supposition of an etheric\nvortex subject to an incoming\n\np. 155\n\nforce of the Logos--both the "Lotuses" described in the Hindu books and the\nnumber of their petals is accounted for by the author, who substitutes for the\nSvadhishthana centre a six-petalled lotus at the spleen, 5b and corrects the\nnumber of petals of the lotus in [the](errata.htm#42) head, which he says is\nnot a thousand, as the book of this Yoga say, "but exactly 960". 6a\n\n"There are some resemblances between this account and the teaching of the Yoga\nShastra, with which in a general way the author cited appears to have some\nacquaintance, and which may have suggested to him some features of his\naccount. There are firstly seven centres, which with one exception correspond\nwith the Chakras described. The author says that there are three other lower\ncentres, but that concentration on them is full of danger. What these are is\nnot stated. There is no centre lower, that I am aware of, than the Muladhara\n(as the name "root-centre" itself implies), and the only centre near to it\nwhich is excluded, in the above-mentioned account, is the Apas Tattva centre,\nor Svadhishthana. Next there is the Force "the\n\np. 156\n\n[paragraph continues] Serpent Fire," which the Hindus call Kundalini, in the\nlowest centre, the Muladhara. Lastly, the effect of the rousing of this force,\nwhich is accomplished by will power (Yogabala), 8 is said to exalt the\nphysical consciousness through the ascending planes to the "heaven world". To\nuse the Hindu expression, the object and aim of Shatchakrabheda is Yoga. This\nis ultimately union with the Supreme Self or Paramatma; but it is obvious,\nthat as the body in its natural state is already, though unconsciously, in\nYoga, otherwise it would not exist, each conscious step upwards is Yoga, and\nthere are many stages of such before complete or Kaivalya Mukti is attained.\nThis and, indeed, many of the. preceding stages are far beyond the "heaven\nworld" of which the author speaks. Yogis are not concerned with the "heaven\nworld," but seek to surpass it; otherwise they are not Yogis at all. What,\naccording to this theory, manifested force apparently does is this: it\nenhances the mental and moral qualities of the self-operator as they existed\nat the time of its discovery. But if this be so, such enhancement may be as\nlittle desirable as the original state.\n\np. 157\n\n[paragraph continues] Apart from the necessity for the possession of health\nand strength, the thought, will, and morality, which it is proposed to subject\nto its influence must be first purified and strengthened before they are\nintensified by the vivifying influence of the aroused force. Further, as I\nhave elsewhere pointed out, 9 the Yogis say that the piercing of the\nBrahmagranthi or "knot" 10 sometimes involves considerable pain, physical\ndisorder, and even disease, as is not unlikely to follow from concentration on\nsuch a centre as the navel (Nabhipadma).\n\n"To use Hindu terms, the Sadhaka must be competent (Adhikari), a matter to be\ndetermined by his Guru, from whom alone the actual method of Yoga, can be\nlearned. The incidental dangers, however, stated by Mr. Leadbeater go beyond\nany mentioned to me by Indians themselves, who seem to be in general unaware\nof the subject of "phallic sorcery", to which reference is made by Mr.\nLeadbeater, who speaks of schools of (apparently Western) \'Black Magic" which\nare said to use Kundalini for the purpose of stimulating the sexual centre.\nAnother author\n\np. 158\n\nsays: 11 "The mere dabbler in the pseudo-occult will only degrade his\nintellect with the puerilities of psychism, become the prey of the evil\ninfluence of the phantasmal world, or ruin his soul by the foul practices of\nphallic sorcery--as thousands of misguided people are doing even in this age."\nIs this so? It is possible that perverse or misguided concentration on sexual\nand connected centres may have the effect alluded to. And it may be that the\nCommentator Lakshmidara alludes to this when he speaks of Uttara Kaulas who\narouse Kundalini in the Muladhara to satisfy their desire for world-enjoyment\nand do not attempt to lead Her upwards to the Highest Centre which is the\nobject of Yoga seekings super-worldly bliss. Of such, a Sanskrit verse runs\n"they are the true prostitutes". I have, however, never heard Indians refer to\nthis matter, probably because, it does not belong to Yoga in its ordinary\nsense, as also by reason of the antecedent discipline required of those who\nwould undertake this Yoga, the nature of their practice, and the aim they have\nin view, such a possibility does not come under consideration.\n\np. 159\n\n[paragraph continues] The Indian who practices this or any other kind of\nspiritual Yoga ordinarily does so not on account of a curious interest in\noccultism or with a desire to gain "astral" or similar experiences. 12 His\nattitude in this as in all other matters is essentially a religious one, based\non a firm faith in Brahman (Sthiranishtha), and inspired by a desire for union\nwith It which is liberation.\n\n"Assuming for argument the alleged correspondence, then the "etheric centres"\nor Chakras of Mr. Leadbeater\'s account appear to be centres of energy of\nPrana-vayu--or Vital Force. The lotuses are also this and centres of the\nuniversal consciousness. Kundalini is the static form of the creative energy\nin bodies which is the source of all energies, including Prana. According to\nMr. Leadbeater\'s theory, Kundalini is some force which is distinct from Prana,\nunderstanding this term to mean vitality of the life-principle, which on\nentrance into the body shows itself in various manifestations of life which\nare the minor Pranas, of which inspiration is called by the general name of\nthe\n\np. 160\n\nforce itself (Prana). Verses 10 and 11 says of Kundalini: "It is She who\nmaintains all the beings (that is, jiva, jivatma) of the world by means of\ninspiration and expiration." She is thus the Prana Devata, but, as She is\n(Comm., vv. 10 and 11) Srishti-sthitilayatmika, all forces therefore are in\nHer. She is, in fact, the Shabdabrahman or "Word" in bodies. The theory\ndiscussed appears to diverge from that of the Yogis when we consider the\nnature of the Chakras and the question of their vivification. According to Mr.\nLeadbeater\'s account, the Chakras are all vortices of "etheric matter",\napparently of the same kind and subject to the same external influence of the\ninrushing sevenfold force of the "Logos" but differing in this, that in each\nof the Chakras one or other of their sevenfold forces is predominant. Again,\nif, as has been stated, the astral body corresponds with the Manomayakosha,\nthen the vivification of the Chakras appears to be, according to Mr.\nLeadbeater, a rousing of the Kamik side of the mental sheath. According to the\nHindu doctrine, these Chakras are differing centres of consciousness,\nvitality, and Tattvik energy. Each of the five lower Chakras is the centre of\n\np. 161\n\nenergy of a gross Tattva--that is, of that form of Tattvik activity or\nTanmatra which manifests the Mahabhuta or sensible matter. The sixth is the\ncentre of the subtle mental Tattva, and the Sahasrara is not called a Chakra\nat all. Nor, as stated, is the splenic centre included among the six Chakras\nwhich are dealt with in this account.\n\n"In the Indian system the total number of the petals corresponds with the\nnumber of the letters of the Sanskrit Alphabet, 13 and the number of the\npetals of any specific lotus is determined by the disposition of the subtile\n"nerves" Nadis around it. These petals, further, bear subtile sound-powers,\nand are fifty in number, as are the letters of the Sanskrit Alphabet.\n\n"This work also describes certain things which are gained by contemplation on\neach of the Chakras. Some of them are of general character, such as long life,\nfreedom from desire and sin, control of the senses, knowledge, power of\nspeech, and fame. Some of these and other qualities are results common to\nconcentration on more than one Chakra. Others are stated in connection with\nthe contemplation upon one centre only. Such [statements](errata.htm#43)\n\np. 162\n\nseem to be made, not necessarily with the intention of accurately recording\nthe specific. result, if any, which follows upon concentration upon a\nparticular centre, but by way of praise for increased self-control, or Stuti-\nvada; as where it is said in v. 21 that contemplation on the Nabhi-padma gains\nfor the Yogi power to destroy and create the world.\n\n"It is also said that mastery of the centres may produce various Siddhis or\npowers in respect of the predominating elements there. And this is, in fact,\nalleged. 14 Pandit Ananta Shastri says: 15 "We can meet with several persons\nevery day elbowing us in the streets or bazaars who in all sincerity attempted\nto reach the highest plane of bliss, but fell victims on the way to the\nillusions of the psychic world, and stopped at one or the other of the six\nChakras. They are of varying degrees of attainment, and are seen to possess\nsome power which is not found even in the best intellectuals of the ordinary\nrun of mankind. That this school of practical psychology was working very well\nin India at one time is evident from these living instances\n\np. 163\n\n[paragraph continues] (not to speak of the numberless treatises on the\nsubject) of men roaming about in all parts of the country." The mere rousing\nof the Serpent power does not, from the spiritual Yoga standpoint, amount to\nmuch. Nothing, however, of real moment, from the higher Yogis\' point of view,\nis achieved until the Ajna Chakra is reached. Here, again, it is said that the\nSadhaka whose Atma is nothing but a meditation on this lotus "becomes the\ncreator, preserver, and destroyer, of the three worlds"; and yet, as the\ncommentator points out (v. 34), "This is but the highest Prashangsa-vada or\nStutivada--that is, compliment--which in Sanskrit literature is as often void\nof reality as it is in our ordinary life. Though much is here gained, it is\nnot until the Tattvas of this centre are also absorbed, and complete knowledge\n16 of the Sahasrara is gained, that the Yogi attains that which is both his\naim and the motive of his labour, cessation from rebirth which follows on the\ncontrol and concentration of the Chitta on the Shivasthanam, the Abode of\nBliss. It is not to be\n\np. 164\n\nsupposed that simply because the Serpent Fire has been aroused that one has\nthereby become a Yogi or achieved the end of Yoga. There are other points of\ndifference which the reader will discover for himself, but into which I do not\nenter, as my object in comparing the two accounts has been to establish a\ngeneral contrast between this modern account and that of the Indian schools. I\nmay, however, add that the differences are not only as to details. The style\nof thought differs in a way not easy shortly to describe, but which will be\nquickly recognised by those who have some familiarity with the Indian\nScriptures and mode of thought. The latter is ever disposed to interpret all\n[processes](errata.htm#45) and their results from a subjective standpoint,\nthough for the purposes of Sadhana the objective aspect is not ignored. The\nIndian theory is highly philosophical. Thus, to take but one instance, whilst\nMr. Leadbeater attributes the power of becoming large or small at will (Anima\nand Mahima Siddhi) to a flexible tube or "microscopic snake" in the forehead,\nthe Hindu says that all powers (Siddhi) are the attributes (Aishvaryya) of the\nLord Ishvara, or Creative Consciousness, and that in the degree that\n\np. 165\n\nthe Jiva realises that consciousness 17 he shares the powers inherent in the\ndegree of his attainment.\n\nThe above is an excerpt from Mr. Avalon\'s introduction to his book, "The\nSerpent Power". Every student of Yoga should read it.\n\n# -FINIS-\n\n#### Om, Om. Om.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[153:1](kmu14.htm#fr_9) This and the following notes compare his and the\nIndian theory. The Devi or Goddess is called Bhujangi or serpent because at\nthe lowest centre (Muladhara) she lies "coiled" round the Linga. "Coiled"--at\nrest. The Cosmic Power in bodies is here at rest; when rouged it is felt as\nintense heat.\n\n[153:2](kmu14.htm#fr_10) Certain Siddhis or occult powers are acquired at each\ncenter as the practitioner works his way upwards.\n\n[154:3](kmu14.htm#fr_11) The petals of the lotus are Pranashakti manifested by\nPranavayu or vital force. Each lotus is a centre of a different form of\n"matter" (Bhuta) there predominant--A .A.\n\n[154:4](kmu14.htm#fr_12) This a Western term--A. A.\n\n[154:5a](kmu14.htm#fr_13) Not mentioned in the account here given.--A. A.\n\n[154:6](kmu14.htm#fr_14) See last note but three.\n\n[155:5b](kmu14.htm#fr_15) Not mentioned in the account here given.--A. A.\n\n[155:6a](kmu14.htm#fr_16) So little attention seems to be given to exactitude\nin this matter that one of the letters is dropped in order to make 1,000\npetals--that is 60 \xc3\x97 20\\. "Thousand" is, here only symbolic of magnitude.--A.\nA.\n\n[156:8](kmu14.htm#fr_17) With the aid of bodily purification, certain Asans\nand Mudras (v. poet).\n\n[157:9](kmu14.htm#fr_18)--In the first edition of my Mahanirvana Tantra.\nCXXIV.\n\n[157:10](kmu14.htm#fr_19) There are three \'knots" which have to be pierced or\ncentres where the force of Maya is particular, strong.\n\n[158:11](kmu14.htm#fr_20) "The Apocalypse Unsealed," p. 62.\n\n[159:12](kmu14.htm#fr_21) Those who do practise magic of the kind mentioned\nwork only in the lowest centre, have recourse to the Prayoga, which leads to\nMayika Shiddhi, whereby commerce is had with female spirits and the like. The\nprocess in this work described is one upon the path of liberation and has\nnothing to do with sexual black magic.\n\n[161:13](kmu14.htm#fr_22) Which are sometimes given as 50 and sometimes as 51.\n\n[162:14](kmu14.htm#fr_23)--See Yogatattve Upanishad, where contemplation on\nthe earth centre secures mastery over, etc. At the same time it points out\nthat these "powers" are obstacles to liberation.\n\n[162:15](kmu14.htm#fr_24)--Anandalahari, p. 35.\n\n[163:16](kmu14.htm#fr_25) This, it is obvious, comes only after long effort,\nand following on less complete experiences and results. According to Indian\nnotions, success (Siddhi) in Yoga may be the fruit of experiences of many\n[preceding](errata.htm#44) lives. Kundalini must be gradually raised from one\ncentre to another until she reaches the Lotus in the cerebrum. The length of\ntime required varies in the individual--it may be years ordinarily or in\nexceptional cased months.\n\n[165:17](kmu14.htm#fr_26) As this is by the Devi\'s grace, She is called "the\ngiver of the eight Siddhis" (Ishitvadyashtasiddhida). See Trishati, II. 47.\nShe gives Aishvaryya.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Advertisements](kmu15.htm)\n\n'
