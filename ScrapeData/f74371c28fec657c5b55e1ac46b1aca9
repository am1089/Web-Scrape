DOCUMENTS.\n\n1. 1 The rule regarding the number of witnesses and their respective characteristics has been thus communicated to you; now I will state in order the laws regarding documents.\n\n2. 2 Within a sixmonth's time even, doubts will arise among men (regarding a transaction). Therefore the letters occurring in a writing were invented of yore by the Creator.\n\n3. 3 Writings are declared to be of three kinds, those written by the king, those written in a particular place, and those written (by a person) with his own hand. Their subdivisions again are numerous.\n\n4. 4 Writings proceeding from (ordinary) people are sevenfold, (viz.) a deed of partition, of gift, of purchase, of mortgage, of agreement, of bondage, of debt, and other (such deeds). The king's edicts are of three sorts.\n\np. 305\n\n5. 5 Where brothers being divided in interests according to their own wish, make a deed of division among themselves, it is called a partition-deed.\n\n6\\. When a person having made a grant of landed property, records it in a deed\nas being endurable as long as the moon and sun are in existence, and which\nmust never be cut down or taken away, it is termed a deed of gift.\n\n7\\. When a person having purchased a house, field or other (property), causes\na document to be executed containing an exact statement of the proper price\npaid for it, it is called a deed of purchase.\n\n8\\. When a person having pledged movable or immovable property, executes a\ndeed stating whether (the property pledged) is to be preserved, or used, it is\ntermed a mortgage-deed.\n\n9\\. When (the people of) a village or province execute a deed of mutual\nagreement, (the purpose of) which is not opposed to the interests of the king\nand in accordance with sacred law, it is designed as a deed of agreement.\n\n10\\. That document which a person destitute of clothes and food executes in a\nwilderness stating, 'I will do your work,' is termed a deed of bondage.\n\n11\\. That contract of debt which a man having borrowed money at interest\nexecutes himself or causes to be written (by another), is called a bond of\ndebt by the wise.\n\n12. 12 Having given a tract of land or the like, the\n\np. 306\n\nking should cause a formal grant to be executed on a copper-plate or a piece\nof cloth, stating the place, the ancestors (of the king), and other\nparticulars,\n\n13. 13 And the names of (the king's) mother and father, and of the king himself, (and containing the statement that) \xc2\x91This grant has been made by me to-day to N. N., the son of N. N., who belongs to the Vedic school N. N.\n\n14\\. As being endurable while the moon and sun last, and as descending by\nright of inheritance to the son, grandson, and more remote descendants, and as\na gift which must never be cut down or taken away, and is entirely exempt from\ndiminution (by the allotment of shares to the king's attendants, and so\nforth),\n\n15\\. Conveying paradise on the giver and preserver, and hell on the taker, for\na period of sixty thousand years, as the recompense for giving and taking (the\nland).\xc2\x92\n\n16\\. (Thus the king should declare in the grant), the Secretaries for peace\nand war signing the grant with the remark, 'I know this.'\n\n17\\. (The grant) should be provided with (the king's) own seal, and with a\nprecise statement of the year, month and so forth, of the value (of the\ndonation), and of the magistrate. Such a document issued by the king is called\na royal edict.\n\n18\\. When the king, satisfied with the faithful services, valour or other\n(laudable qualities) of a person, bestows landed or other property on him, it\n\np. 307\n\nis (called) a writing containing a mark of royal favour.\n\n19. 19 That which establishes a claim, recording the four parts of a judicial proceeding and bearing the royal seal, is termed a document of success (or decree).\n\n20. 20 Clever forgers acquainted with place and time will make a writing similar (to the original document). Such (writings) should be examined with great care.\n\n21\\. Women, infants, the suffering, and persons unacquainted with the art of\nwriting, are deceived by their own relations fabricating documents signed with\ntheir names. Such (forgery) may be found out by means of internal evidence and\nlegitimate titles.\n\n22. 22 A document executed by a madman, an idiot, an infant, one who has absconded through fear of the king, a bashful person, or one tormented by fear, is not invalidated (by an impossibility to produce its author).\n\n23. 23 (But, as a rule) a document executed by a dying person, an enemy, one oppressed with fear, a suffering person, a woman, one intoxicated, distressed by a calamity, at night, by fraud, or by force, does not hold good.\n\n24\\. Where even a single witness entered in a deed is infamous and reproached\n(by the public voice), or where its writer is held in such estimation, it is\ncalled a false document.\n\np. 308\n\n25. 25 A writing being spoiled by fire, or executed a long time ago, or soiled with dirt, or intended for a very short period only, or containing (a number of) mutilated or effaced syllables, is reckoned as a false document.\n\n26. 26 Let a man show (a document) on every occasion to (meetings of) families, associations (of traders), assemblies (of cohabitants), and other (bodies of persons), and read it out to them, and remind them of it, in order to establish its validity.\n\n27. 27 The acquirer (of landed or other property) should establish the written title (under which he is holding it); his son should establish the fact of possession only. If (the father) has been impeached in a court of justice, the son also should be required to prove the written title.\n\n28. 28 When a loan (recorded in a bond) is not expressly claimed from a debtor who has means enough (to discharge it) and is at hand, the bond loses its validity, as the debt is presumed to have been paid (in that case).\n\n29\\. A writing which has neither been seen nor read out for thirty years,\nshould not be recognised as valid, even though the (subscribing) witnesses be\nliving.\n\n30. 30 When a man does not produce the bond and omits to ask his debtor (to restore the loan), after\n\np. 309\n\nhis loan has ceased to yield interest, the bond becomes suspected.\n\n31. 31 A document is certainly not overruled either by witnesses or by an oath (or ordeal), but its validity is diminished by neglect, if it is neither shown nor read.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[304:1](sbe3366.htm#fr_947) VIII, 1.
