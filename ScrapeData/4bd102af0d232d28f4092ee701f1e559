It is certain indeed that a number\nof the most important of those ceremonies are contemporaneous with or even\nearlier than the most ancient hymns of the _Ri_ g-veda, as far as their\nfundamental elements and character are concerned, whatever their precise\narrangement may have been. However, in the literature of the oldest period\nthey play no part. It was another portion of the ritual that attracted the\nattention of the poets to whom we owe the hymns to Agni, Indra, and the other\ndeities of the Vedic Olympus, viz. the offerings of the _S_ rauta-Ritual with\ntheir far superior pomp, or, to state the matter more precisely, among the\nofferings of the _S_ rauta-Ritual the Soma offering. In the Soma offering\ncentred the thought, the poetry, and we may almost say the life of the Vasish\n_th_ as, of the Vi _s_ vamitras, &c., in whose families the poetry of the _Ri_\ng-veda had its home. We may assume that the acts of the G _ri_ hya worship,\nbeing more limited in extent and simpler in their ritual construction than the\ngreat Soma offerings, were not yet at that time, so far as they existed at\nall, decked out with the reciting of the poetic texts, which we find later on\nconnected with them, and which in the case of the Soma offering came early to\nbe used. Probably they were celebrated in simple unadorned fashion;\n\np. x\n\nwhat the person making the offering had to say was doubtless limited to short,\npossibly prose formulas, so that these ceremonies remained free from the\npoetry of the above-mentioned families of priests 1. We think that the\ncharacter of the verses given in the G _ri_ hya-sutras, which had to be\nrepeated at the performance of the different ceremonies, justifies us in\nmaking these conjectures. Some of these verses indeed are old Vedic verses,\nbut we have no proof that they were composed for the purposes of the G _ri_\nhya ceremonies, and the connection in which we find them in the _Ri_ g-veda\nproves rather the contrary. Another portion of these verses and songs proves\nto have been composed indeed for the very G _ri_ hya ceremonies for which they\nare prescribed in the texts of the ritual: but these verses are more recent\nthan the old parts of the _Ri_ g-veda. Part of them are found in the _Ri_\ng-veda in a position which speaks for their more recent origin, others are not\ncontained in the _Ri_ g-veda at all. Many of these verses are found in the\nmore recent Vedic Sa _m_ hitas, especially in the Atharva-veda Sa _m_ hita\nwhich may be regarded in the main as a treasure of G _ri_ hya verses; others\nfinally have not as yet been traced to any Vedic Sa _m_ hita, and we know them\nfrom the G _ri_ hya-sutras only. We may infer that, during the latter part of\nthe _Ri_ g-veda period, ceremonies such as marriage and burial began to be\ndecked out with poetry as had long been the case with the Soma offering. The\nprincipal collection of marriage sentences 2 and the sentences for the\n\np. xi\n\nburial of the dead 1 are found in the tenth Ma _n_ _d_ ala of the _Ri_ g-veda,\nwhich, for the most part, is known to be of later origin than the preceding\nportions of the collections 2. If we look into the character of the verses,\nwhich these long G _ri_ hya songs are composed of, we shall find additional\ngrounds for assuming their early origin. A few remarks about their metrical\ncharacter will make this clear 3. There is no other metre in which the\ncontrast between the early and later periods of Vedic literature manifests\nitself so clearly as in the Anush _t_ ubh-metre 4. The Anush _t_ ubh hemistich\nconsists of sixteen syllables, which are divided by the caesura into two\nhalves of eight syllables each. The second of these halves has as a rule the\niambic ending ( ![](img/_01100.jpg)), though this rule was not so strictly\ncarried out in the early as in the later period 5. The iambic ending is also\nthe rule in the older parts of the Veda for the close of the first half, i.e.\nfor the four syllables before the caesura 6. We know that the later prosody,\nas we see it in certain late parts of Vedic literature, in the Pali Pi _t_\nakas of the Buddhists, and later in the great epic poems, not only departs\nfrom the usage of the older period, but adopts a directly contrary course,\ni.e. the iambic ending of the first pada, which was formerly the rule, is not\nallowed at all later, and instead of it the prevailing ending is the antispast\n( ![](img/_01101.jpg)) It goes without saying that such a change in metrical\nusage, as the one just described, cannot have\n\np. xii\n\ntaken place at one jump. And accordingly a consideration of the Vedic texts\nreveals a transition period or rather a series of several transition periods\nbetween the old and the new standpoints. The first change is that every other\nending of the first pada is allowed by the side of the iambic ending. The two\nforms of the ending, the one prevailing in the earliest, and the one\nprevailing in the later period of the prosody, the iambic (\n![](img/_01200.jpg)) and the antispastic ( ![](img/_01201.jpg)), are those\nthat occur most frequently in the intermediate period, but besides them all\nother possible forms are allowed 1.\n\nThis is precisely the stage of metrical development which the great G _ri_ hya\nsongs of the tenth Ma _n_ _d_ ala of the _Ri_ g-veda have reached. Let us\nconsider, for instance, the marriage songs and the marriage sayings, X, 85,\nand see what kind of ending there is at the end of the first pada. Of the\nfirst seventeen verses of this Sukta sixteen are in Anush _t_ ubh metre (verse\n14 is Trish _t_ ubh); we have therefore thirty-two cases in which the metrical\nform of these syllables must be investigated. The quantity of the syllable\nimmediately preceding the caesura being a matter of indifference, we have not\nsixteen but only eight a priori possible combinations for the form of the last\nfour syllables of the pada; I give each of these forms below, adding each time\nin how many of the thirty-two cases it is used:\n\n![](img/_01202.jpg)\n\n|\n\n8  \n  \n---|---  \n  \n![](img/_01203.jpg)\n\n|\n\n5  \n  \n![](img/_01204.jpg)\n\n|\n\n5  \n  \n![](img/_01205.jpg)\n\n|\n\n4  \n  \n![](img/_01206.jpg)\n\n|\n\n3  \n  \n![](img/_01207.jpg)\n\n|\n\n3  \n  \n![](img/_01208.jpg)\n\n|\n\n3  \n  \n![](img/_01209.jpg)\n\n|\n\n_  1_  \n  \n\n\n|\n\n32  \n  \np. xiii\n\nWe see that all the possible combinations are actually represented in these\nthirty-two cases, and accordingly the metrical build of this Sukta shows that\nit belongs to a period to which only the latest songs of the _Ri_ g-veda\ncollection can be referred, but the peculiarities of which may be often\nnoticed in the Atharva-veda and in the verses scattered throughout the Brahma\n_n_ a literature 1.\n\nA hasty glance suffices to show that those verses of the G _ri_ hya ritual\nwhich do not appear in the Sa _m_ hitas, but which are quoted at full length\nin the G _ri_ hya-sutras, are also in the same stage. For instance, the seven\nAnush _t_ ubh verses which are quoted _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya I, 19, 5. 6,\ngive us the following relations, if we investigate them as we did those in\n_Ri_ g-veda X, 85:\n\n![](img/_01300.jpg)\n\n|\n\n4  \n  \n---|---  \n  \n![](img/_01301.jpg)\n\n|\n\n3  \n  \n![](img/_01302.jpg)\n\n|\n\n2  \n  \n![](img/_01303.jpg)\n\n|\n\n2  \n  \n![](img/_01304.jpg)\n\n|\n\n1  \n  \n![](img/_01305.jpg)\n\n|\n\n1  \n  \n![](img/_01306.jpg)\n\n|\n\n_  1_  \n  \n\n\n|\n\n14  \n  \nThus even the small number of fourteen hemistichs is enough to give us seven\nof the eight existing combinations, and no single one occurs at all often\nenough to allow us to call it predominant.\n\nOr we may take the saying that accompanies the performance of the medha _g_\nanana on the new-born child. In the version of \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana 2 we have:\n\n![medh\xc3\xa2<I>m</I> to deva<I>h</I> Savit\xc3\xa2<br> medh\xc3\xa2<I>m</I> to A<I>s</I>vinau\ndevau.](img/_01307.jpg)\n\nIn the version adopted in the school of Gobhila 3 the\n\np. xiv\n\ncontext of the first line is different, but the metre is the same:\n\n![medh\xc3\xa2<I>m</I> to Mitr\xc3\xa2varu<I>n</I>au.](img/_01400.jpg)\n\nOr the saying with which the pupil (brahma _k_ arin) has to lay a log of wood\non the fire of the teacher 1:\n\n![Agnaye samidham \xc3\xa2h\xc3\xa2rsham<br> tay\xc3\xa2 tvam Agne vardhasva.](img/_01401.jpg)\n\nThere would be no object in multiplying the number of examples; those here\ngiven are sufficient to prove our proposition, that the development of the G\n_ri_ hya rites in the form in which they are described to us in the Sutras,\nthat especially their being accompanied with verses, which were to be recited\nby their performance, is later than the time of the oldest Vedic poetry, and\ncoincides rather with the transition period in the development of the Anush\n_t_ ubh metre, a period which lies between the old Vedic and the later\nBuddhistic and epic form.\n\nBesides the formulae intended to be recited during the performance of the\nvarious sacred acts, the G _ri_ hya-sutras contain a second kind of verses,\nwhich differ essentially from the first kind in regard to metre; viz. verses\nof ritualistic character, which are inserted here and there between the prose\nSutras, and of which the subject-matter is similar to that of the surrounding\nprose. We shall have to consider these ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ agathas, as they are\noccasionally called, later; at present let us go on looking for traces of the\nG _ri_ hya ritual and for the origin of G _ri_ hya literature in the\nliterature which precedes the Sutras.\n\nThe Brahma _n_ a texts, which, as a whole, have for their subject-matter the\nVaitanika ceremonies celebrated with the three holy fires, furnish evidence\nthat the G _ri_ hya fire, together with the holy acts accomplished in\nconnection with it, were also already known. The Aitareya-Brahma _n_ a 2 gives\nthis\n\np. xv\n\nfire the most usual name, the same name which is used for it in the Sutras, g\n_ri_ hya agni, and describes a ceremony to be performed over this fire with\nexpressions which agree exactly with the style of the G _ri_ hya-sutras 1. We\noften find in the Brahma _n_ a texts also mention of the terminus technicus,\nwhich the G _ri_ hya-sutras use many times as a comprehensive term for the\nofferings connected with G _ri_ hya ritual, the word pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a 2. For\ninstance, the _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a 3, in order to designate the whole\nbody of offerings, uses the expression: all offerings, those that are Pakaya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as and the others. It is especially common to find the Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\nas mentioned in the Brahma _n_ a texts in connection with the myth of Manu.\nThe Taittiriya Sa _m_ hita 4 opposes the whole body of sacrifices to the\nPakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as. The former belonged to the gods, who through it attained to\nthe heavenly world; the latter concerned Manu: thus the goddess I _d_ a turned\nto him. Similar remarks, bringing Manu or the goddess I _d_ a into relation\nwith the Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as, are to be found Taittiriya Sa _m_ hita VI, 2, 5,\n4; Aitareya-Brahma _n_ a III, 40, 2. However, in this case as in many others,\nthe _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a contains the most detailed data, from which we\nsee how the idea of Manu as the performer of Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as is connected\nwith the history of the great deluge, out of which Manu alone was left. We\nread in the _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a 5:\n\np. xvi\n\n\'Now the flood had carried away all these creatures, and thus Manu was left\nthere alone. Then Manu went about singing praises and toiling, wishing for\noffspring. And he sacrificed there also with a Paka-sacrifice. He poured\nclarified butter, thickened milk, whey, and curds in the water as a libation.\'\nIt is then told how the goddess I _d_ a arose out of this offering. I presume\nthat the story of the Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a as the first offering made by Manu\nafter the great flood, stands in a certain correlation to the idea of the\nintroduction of the three sacrificial fires through Pururavas 1. Pururavas is\nthe son of I _d_ a; the original man Manu, who brings forth I _d_ a through\nhis offering, cannot have made use of a form of offering which presupposes the\nexistence of I _d_ a, and which moreover is based on the triad of the sacred\nfires introduced by Pururavas; hence Manu\'s offering must have been a Pakaya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a; we read in one of the G _ri_ hya-sutras 2: \'All Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as\nare performed without I _d_ a.\'\n\nThere are still other passages in the Brahma _n_ a texts showing that the G\n_ri_ hya offerings were already known; I will mention a saying of Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya\'s reported in the _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a 3: he would not allow that\nthe daily morning and evening offering was a common offering, but said that,\nin a certain measure, it was a Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a. Finally I would call\nattention to the offering prescribed in the last book of the _S_ atapatha\nBrahma _n_ a 4 for the man \'who wishes that a learned son should be born to\nhim;\' it is there stated that the preparation of the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya (clarified\nbutter) should be performed \'according to the rule of the Sthalipaka (pot-\nboiling),\' and the way in which the offering is to\n\np. xvii\n\nbe performed is described by means of an expression, upaghatam 1, which often\noccurs in the G _ri_ hya literature in a technical sense.\n\nWe thus see that the Brahma _n_ a books are acquainted with the G _ri_ hya\nfire, and know about the G _ri_ hya offerings and their permanent technical\npeculiarities; and it is not merely the later portions of the Brahma _n_ a\nworks such as the fourteenth book of the _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a, in which\nwe meet with evidence of this kind; we find it also in portions against the\nantiquity of which no objections can be raised.\n\nWhile therefore on the one hand the Brahma _n_ a texts prove the existence of\nthe G _ri_ hya ceremonial, we see on the other hand, and first of all by means\nof the Brahma _n_ a texts themselves, that a literary treatment of this\nritualistic subject-matter, as we find it in the Brahma _n_ as themselves with\nregard to the _S_ rauta offerings, cannot then have existed. If there had\nexisted texts, similar to the Brahma _n_ a texts preserved to us, which\ntreated of the G _ri_ hya ritual, then, even supposing the texts themselves\nhad disappeared, we should still necessarily find traces of them in the Brahma\n_n_ as and Sutras. He who will take the trouble to collect in the Brahma _n_ a\ntexts the scattered references to the then existing literature, will be\nastonished at the great mass of notices of this kind that are preserved: but\nnowhere do we find traces of G _ri_ hya Brahma _n_ as. And besides, if such\nworks had ever existed, we should be at a loss to understand the difference\nwhich the Hindus make between the _S_ rauta-sutras based on _S_ ruti\n(revelation), and the G _ri_ hya-sutras resting on Sm _ri_ ti (tradition)\nalone 2. The sacred G _ri_ hya acts are regarded as \'smarta,\' and when the\nquestion is raised with what right they can be considered as a duty resting on\nthe sacrificer alongside of the _S_ rauta acts, the answer is given that they\ntoo are based on a _S_ akha of the Veda, but that this _S_ akha is\n\np. xviii\n\nhidden, so that its existence can only be demonstrated by reasoning 1.\n\nBut the Brahma _n_ a texts furnish us still in another way the most decisive\narguments to prove that there have been no expositions of the G _ri_ hya\nritual in Brahma _n_ a form: they contain exceptionally and scattered through\ntheir mass sections, in which they treat of subjects which according to later\ncustom would have been treated in the G _ri_ hya-sutras. Precisely this\nsporadic appearance of G _ri_ hya chapters in the midst of expositions of a\ntotally different contents leads us to draw the conclusion that literary\ncompositions did not then exist, in which these chapters would have occupied\ntheir proper place as integral parts of a whole. Discussions of questions of G\n_ri_ hya ritual are found in the Brahma _n_ a literature, naturally enough in\nthose appendices of various kinds which generally follow the exposition of the\nprincipal subject of the _S_ rauta ritual. Accordingly we find in the eleventh\nbook of the _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a 2, among the manifold additions to\nsubjects previously treated, which make up the principal contents of this book\n3, an exposition of the Upanayana, i.e. the solemn reception of the pupil by\nthe teacher, who is to teach him the Veda. The way in which the chapter on the\nUpanayana is joined to the preceding one, is eminently characteristic; it\nshows that it is the merest accident which has brought about in that place the\ndiscussion of a subject connected with the G _ri_ hya ritual, and that a\nceremony such as the Upanayana is properly not in its proper place in the\nmidst of the literature of Brahma _n_ a texts. A dialogue (brahmodya) between\nUddalaka and _S_ au _k_ eya precedes; the two talk of the Agnihotra and of\nvarious expiations (praya _s_ _k_ itta) connected with that sacrifice. At the\nend _S_ au _k_ eya, filled with astonishment at the wisdom of Uddalaka,\ndeclares that he wishes to come to him as a pupil (upayani bhagavantam), and\nUddalaka\n\np. xix\n\naccepts him as his pupil. It is the telling of this story and the decisive\nwords upayani and upaninye which furnish the occasion for introducing the\nfollowing section on the Upanayana 1. The subject is there treated in the\npeculiar style of the Brahma _n_ a texts, a style which we need not\ncharacterize here. I shall only mention one point, viz. that into the\ndescription and explanation of the Upanayana ceremony has been inserted one of\nthose _S_ lokas, such as we often find in the G _ri_ hya-sutras also, as a\nsort of ornamental amplification of the prose exposition 2. \'Here a _S_ loka\nis also sung,\' says the Brahma _n_ a 3:\n\n![](img/_01900.jpg)  \n  \n---  \n  \na _k_ aryo garbhi bhavati hastam adhaya dakshi _n_ am  \n  \n![](img/_01901.jpg)  \n  \nt _ri_ tiyasya _m_ sa _g_ ayate savitrya saha brahma _n_ a _h_  4.  \n  \n[paragraph continues] From this passage we see, on the one hand, that the\ncomposition of such isolated 5 _S_ lokas explaining certain points of the G\n_ri_ hya ritual goes back to quite an early period; on the other hand, we are\ncompelled to assume that the _S_ lokas of this kind which are quoted in the G\n_ri_ hya-sutras differ nevertheless from the analogous _S_ lokas of the early\nperiod, or at any rate that the old _S_ lokas must have undergone a change\nwhich modernized their structure, so as to be received into the G _ri_ hya-\nsutras; for the metre of the _S_ loka just quoted, which has the antispast\nbefore the caesura in neither of its two halves, and which has even a double\niambus before the caesura in one half, is decidedly of an older type than the\none peculiar to the _S_ lokas quoted in the G _ri_ hya-sutras 6.\n\np. xx\n\nAnother G _ri_ hya section in the _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a seems to have\nfound its place there through a similar accidental kind of joining on to a\npreceding chapter as the above-mentioned passage. In XI, 5, 5 a story of the\nbattle of the gods and Asuras is told: the gods beat the Asuras back by means\nof constantly larger Sattra celebrations and conquer for themselves the world\nof heaven. It seems to me that the description of the great Sattras celebrated\nby the gods is the occasion of the joining on of a section beginning with the\nwords 1: \'There are five great sacrifices (mahaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as); they are great\nSattras: the offering to Beings, the offering to men, the offering to the\nFathers (i.e. the Manes), the offering to the Gods, the offering to the\nBrahman.\' After this introduction follows an account of one of the five great\nofferings, namely of the Brahmaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, i.e. of the daily Veda recitation\n(svadhyaya). The third Adhyaya of \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana\'s G _ri_ hya-sutra begins in\nexactly the same way with the sentence: \'Now (follow) the five sacrifices: the\nsacrifice to the Gods, the sacrifice to the Beings, the sacrifice to the\nFathers, the sacrifice to the Brahman, the sacrifice to men,\' and then follows\nhere also a discussion of the Brahmaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, which is entirely analogous\nto that given in the _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a. \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana here does not\ncontent himself with describing the actual course of ceremonies as is the rule\nin the Sutra texts; he undertakes, quite in the way of the Brahma _n_ a texts,\nto explain their meaning: \'In that he recites the _Ri_ _k_ as, he thereby\nsatiates the gods with oblations of milk, in that (he recites) the Ya _g_ us,\nwith oblations of ghee,\' &c. It is plain that the mode of exposition adopted\nby \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana in this passage, which is different from the usual Sutra\nstyle, finds its explanation in the supposition that exceptionally in this\ncase the author of the G _ri_ hya-sutra had before him a Brahma _n_ a text,\nwhich he could take as his model, whether that text was the _S_ atapatha\nitself or another similar text.\n\nAmong the extremely various prescriptions which we find\n\np. xxi\n\nin the last sections of the _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a, there is a rather long\nsection, which also really belongs to the G _ri_ hya domain. To quote from\nthis section 1: \'If a man wishes that a learned son should be born to him,\nfamous, a public man, a popular speaker, that he should know all the Vedas,\nand that he should live to his full age, then, after having prepared boiled\nrice with meat and butter, they should both eat, being fit to have offspring,\'\n&c. Then follows a description of an \xc3\x82 _g_ ya offering, after which the\nmarital cohabitation is to be performed with certain formulas. This, however,\nis not the last of the acts through which the father assures himself of the\npossession of such a distinguished son; certain rites follow, which are to be\nperformed at birth and after birth, the \xc3\x82yushya ceremony and the Medha _g_\nanana. These rites are here prescribed for the special case where the father\nhas the above-mentioned wishes for the prosperity of his child; but the\ndescription agrees essentially with the description of the corresponding acts\nin the G _ri_ hya-sutras 2, which are inculcated for all cases, without\nreference to a determined wish of the father. It is a justifiable conjecture\nthat, although this certainly does not apply to the whole of ceremonies\ndescribed in the G _ri_ hya-sutras, many portions of these ceremonies and\nverses that were used in connection with them, &c., were first developed, not\nas a universal rite or duty, but as the special possession of individuals, who\nhoped to attain special goods and advantages by performing the ceremony in\nthis way.\n\nIt was only later, as I think, that such prescriptions\n\np. xxii\n\nassumed the character of universality, with which we find them propounded in\nthe G _ri_ hya-sutras.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to go through the sections of the texts of other\nVedic schools referring to the G _ri_ hya ritual in the same way in which we\nhave done it in the case of the _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a. The data which we\nhave produced from the great Brahma _n_ a of the white Ya _g_ ur-veda, will be\nsufficient for our purpose, which is to give an idea of the stage in which the\nliterary treatment of the G _ri_ hya ritual stood during the Brahma _n_ a\nperiod. As we see, there were then properly no G _ri_ hya texts; but many of\nthe elements which we find later in the G _ri_ hya texts were either already\nformed or were in the process of formation. Most of the verses which are used\nfor the G _ri_ hya acts\xc2\x97in so far as they are not verses composed in the\noldest period for the Soma offering and transferred to the G _ri_ hya\nceremonies\xc2\x97bear the formal imprint of the Brahma _n_ a period; the domestic\nsacrificial fire and the ritual peculiarities of the Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as which\nwere to be performed at it, were known; descriptions of some such Pakaya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ as were given in prose; there were also already _S_ lokas which gave in\nmetrical form explanations about certain points of the G _ri_ hya ritual, just\nas we find in the Brahma _n_ a texts analogous _S_ lokas referring to subjects\nconnected with the _S_ rauta ritual.\n\nThus was the next step which the literary development took in the Sutra period\nprepared and rendered easy. The more systematic character which the exposition\nof the ritualistic discipline assumed in this period, necessarily led to the\ntaking of this step: the domain of the G _ri_ hya sacrifices was recognised\nand expounded as a second great principal part of the ritual of sacrifices\nalongside of the _S_ rauta domain which was alone attended to in the earlier\nperiod. The G _ri_ hya-sutras arose which treat, according to the expression\nof \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana in his first sentence, of the g _ri_ hya _n_ i 1 as\ndistinguished from the vaitanikani, or, as _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana says, of the pakaya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as, or, as Paraskara says, of the g _ri_ hyasthalipakana _m_ karma.\nThe\n\np. xxiii\n\n[paragraph continues] G _ri_ hya-sutras treat their subject of course in\nexactly the same style in which the sacrifices of the _S_ rauta ritual had\nbeen treated by the _S_ rauta-sutras, which they constantly assume to be known\nand which are the works of teachers of the same Vedic schools, and oftentimes\neven perhaps the works of the same authors. Only certain differences in the\ncharacter of the two groups of texts are naturally conditioned on the one hand\nby the greater complexity of the _S_ rauta sacrifices and the comparative\nsimplicity of the G _ri_ hya sacrifices, on the other hand by the fact that\nthe _S_ rauta-sutras are entirely based on Brahma _n_ a texts, in which the\nsame subjects were treated, while the G _ri_ hya-sutras, as we have seen,\npossessed such a foundation only for a very small portion of their contents.\n\nIt goes without saying that the above-mentioned statement that the subjects\ntreated of in the G _ri_ hya-sutras are Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as 1 or G _ri_\nhyasthalipakas should not be pressed with the utmost strictness, as though\nnothing were treated in the G _ri_ hya-sutras which does not come under these\nheads. First of all the term Sthalipaka is too narrow, since it does not\ninclude the offerings of sacrificial butter which constituted a great number\nof ceremonies. But besides many ceremonies and observances are taught in the G\n_ri_ hya-sutras, which cannot in any way be characterised as sacrifices at\nall, only possessing some inner resemblance to the group of sacrifices there\ntreated of, or standing in more or less close connection with them 2.\n\nThe Sutra texts divide the Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as in various ways; either four or\nseven principal forms are taken up. The\n\np. xxiv\n\ncommonest division is that into the four classes of the hutas, ahutas,\nprahutas, pra _s_ itas 1. The division into seven classes is doubtless\noccasioned by the division of the Havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as and of the Somaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\nas, which also each include seven classes 2; for the nature of the sacrifices\nin question would hardly of itself have led to such a division. The seven\nclasses taken up are either those given by Gautama VIII, 15 3: \'The seven\nkinds of Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as, viz. the Ash _t_ aka, the Parva _n_ a (Sthalipaka,\noffered on the new and full moon days), the funeral oblations, the _S_ rava\n_n_ i, the \xc3\x82grahaya _n_ i, the _K_ aitri, and the \xc3\x82 _s_ vayu _g_ i.\' Or else\nthe seven classes are established as follows, the fourfold division being\nutilised to some extent 4: \'Huta, Prahuta, \xc3\x82huta (sic, not Ahuta), the spit-ox\nsacrifice, the Bali offering, the re-descent (on the \xc3\x82grahaya _n_ a day), the\nAsh _t_ aka sacrifice.\' According to the account of Prof. Buhler 5, the\nexposition of Baudhayana, who gives this division, keeps closely to the course\nwhich it prescribes. For the rest, however, the G _ri_ hya texts with which I\nam acquainted do not follow any of these divisions, and this is easily\naccounted for, if we consider the artificial character of these\nclassifications, which are undertaken merely for the sake of having a complete\nscheme of the sacrifices. On the contrary, as a whole the texts give an\narrangement which is based on the nature of the ceremonies they describe. In\nmany instances we find considerable variations between the texts of the\ndifferent schools; often enough, in a given text, the place\n\np. xxv\n\nwhich is assigned to a given chapter is not to be explained without assuming a\ncertain arbitrariness on tlfe part of the author. But, as a whole, we cannot\nfail to recognise in the arrangement of the different texts a certain\nagreement, which we will here merely try to explain in its main traits; the\npoints of detail, which would complete what we here say, will occur of\nthemselves to any one who looks at the texts themselves.\n\nThe domestic life of the Hindus represents, so to speak, a circle, in which it\nis in a certain measure indifferent what point is selected as the starting-\npoint. Two especially important epochs in this life are: on the one hand, the\nperiod of studentship of the young Brahma _k_ arin devoted to the study of the\nVeda; at the beginning of this period comes the ceremony of the Upanayana, at\nthe end that of the Samavartana; on the other hand, marriage (vivaha), which\nbesides has a special importance for the G _ri_ hya ritual, from the\ncircumstance, that as a rule the cultus of the domestic sacrificial fire\nbegins with marriage. One can just as well imagine an exposition of the G _ri_\nhya ritual, which proceeds from the description of the studentship to that of\nthe marriage, as one which proceeds from the description of the marriage to\nthat of the studentship. The Samavartana, which designates the end of the\nperiod of studentship, gives the Hindu the right and the duty to found a\nhousehold 1. On the other hand, if the exposition begins with the marriage,\nthere follows naturally the series of ceremonies which are to be performed up\nto the birth of a child, and then the ceremonies for the young child, which\nfinally lead up to the Upanayana and a description of the period of\nstudentship. The Hira _n_ yake _s_ i-sutra alone, of the Sutras treated of in\nthese translations, follows the first of the two orders mentioned 2; the other\ntexts follow the other order,\n\np. xxvi\n\nwhich has been already described by Prof. Max Muller almost thirty years ago,\nand we cannot do better than to give his description 1: \'Then (i.e. after the\nmarriage) follow the Sa _m_ skaras, the rites to be performed at the\nconception of a child, at various periods before his birth, at the time of his\nbirth, the ceremony of naming the child, of carrying him out to see the sun,\nof feeding him, of cutting his hair, and lastly of investing him as a student,\nand handing him to a Guru, under whose care he is to study the sacred\nwritings, that is to say, to learn them by heart, and \'to perform all the\noffices of a Brahma _k_ arin, or religious student.\'\n\nIn this way we find, as a rule, in the foreground in the first part of the G\n_ri_ hya-sutras this great group of acts which accompany the domestic life\nfrom marriage to the studentship and the Samavartana of the child sprung from\nwedlock. We find, however, inserted into the description of these ceremonies,\nin various ways in the different Sutras, the exposition of a few ritualistic\nmatters which we have not yet mentioned. In the first place a description of\nthe setting up of the sacred domestic fire, i.e. of the ceremony which in the\ndomain of the G _ri_ hya ritual corresponds to the agnyadheya of the _S_ rauta\nritual. The setting up of the fire forms the necessary preliminary to all\nsacred acts; the regular time for it is the wedding 2, so that the fire used\nfor the wedding acts accompanies the young couple to their home, and there\nforms the centre of their household worship. Accordingly in the G _ri_ hya-\nsutras the description of the setting up of the fire stands, as a rule, at the\nbeginning of the whole, not far from the description of the wedding.\n\nNext the introductory sections of the G _ri_ hya-sutras have to describe the\ntype of the G _ri_ hya sacrifice, which is universally available and recurs at\nall household ceremonies. This can be done in such a way that this type is\ndescribed for itself, without direct reference to a particular sacrifice. This\nis the case in Paraskara, who in the first chapter of his\n\np. xxvii\n\n[paragraph continues] Sutra describes the rites recurring at each sacrifice,\nand then remarks: \'This ritual holds good, whenever a sacrifice is offered 1.\'\nSimilarly \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana, in one of the first chapters of his work, enumerates\nthe rites which are to be performed \'whenever he intends to sacrifice 2.\'\nOther texts give a general description of the G _ri_ hya sacrifice by\nexemplifying it by one special sacrifice. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana 3 chooses for this the\nsacrifice which the bridegroom has to offer, when a favourable answer has been\ngranted to his wooing; Gobhila 4 gives at least the greater part of the rules\nin question a propos of the full moon and of the new moon sacrifice; Hira _n_\nyake _s_ in 5, who opens his account at the period of the studentship of the\nyoung Brahma _n_ a, describes the sacrificial type a propos of the Upanayana\nrite.\n\nThe sacrifices which are to be offered daily at morning and at evening, those\nwhich are celebrated monthly on the days of the new moon and of the full\nmoon\xc2\x97the G _ri_ hya copies of the Agnihotra and of the Dar _s_ apur _n_ amasa\nsacrifices\xc2\x97and, thirdly, the daily distribution of the Bali offerings: these\nceremonies are commonly described along with what we have called the first\ngreat group of the G _ri_ hya acts, immediately preceding or following the\nVivaha.\n\nWe find, as a second group of sacred acts, a series of celebrations, which, if\nthe man has founded his household, are to be performed regularly at certain\ntimes of the year at the household fire. So the _S_ rava _n_ a sacrifice,\nwhich is offered to the snakes at the time when, on account of the danger from\nsnakes, a raised couch is necessary at night. At the end of this period the\nfestival of the re-descent is celebrated: the exchanging of the high couch for\nthe low couch on the ground. Between these two festivals comes the P _ri_\nshataka offering on the full-moon day of the month \xc3\x82 _s_ vayu _g_ a; it\nreceives in the G _ri_ hya texts the place corresponding to that which\nactually belongs to\n\np. xxviii\n\nit in the series of the festivals. As a rule 1 the acts we have just mentioned\nare followed, in accordance with the natural series, by the Ash _t_ aka\nfestivals, which are celebrated during the last months of the year.\n\nAlongside of these acts which are connected with fixed points of the year we\nfind in the various G _ri_ hya texts an account of a series of other\nceremonies, which, in accordance with their nature, have no such fixed\nposition in the system of the ritual. Thus, for instance, the rites which\nrefer to the choice of a piece of ground to build a house or to the building\nitself; further, the rites connected with agriculture and cattle raising. In\nmany texts we find together with this group of acts also an account of the\nceremonies, related to fixed points in the year, which stand in connection\nwith the annual course of Vedic study: the description of the opening festival\nand of the closing festival of the school term, as well as a point which\ngenerally follows these descriptions, the rules as to the anadhyaya, i.e. as\nto the occasions which necessitate an intermission in the study of the Veda\nfor a longer or for a shorter period. As a rule, the G _ri_ hya-sutras bring\nthe account of these things into the group of acts which refer to the\nhousehold life of the G _ri_ hastha; for the Adhyapana, i.e. the teaching of\nthe Veda, held the first place among the rights and duties of the Brahma _n_ a\nwho had completed his time at school. On the other hand these ceremonies can\nnaturally also be considered as connected with the school life of the young\nHindu, and accordingly they are placed in that division by Gobhila 2, between\nthe description of the Upanayana and that of the Samavartana.\n\nThe sacred acts connected with the burial and the worship of the dead (the\nvarious kinds of _S_ raddha rites) may be designated as a third group of the\nceremonies which are described to us in the G _ri_ hya.-sutras. Finally, a\nfourth group comprises the acts which are connected with the attainment of\nparticular desires (kamyani). Among the\n\np. xxix\n\ntexts here translated we find a somewhat detailed account of these ceremonies\nin the Gobhila-sutra and in the Khadira-G _ri_ hya only 1.\n\nThese remarks cannot claim to give a complete outline of the contents and\narrangement of the G _ri_ hya texts; they only aim at giving an idea of the\nfundamental traits, which in each particular text are modified by manifold\nvariations, but which nevertheless are to these variations as the rule is to\nthe exceptions.\n\nWe must now speak of the relations of the G _ri_ hya-sutras to the two other\nkinds of Sutra texts, with which they have so many points of contact in the\n_S_ rauta-sutras and the Dharma-sutras.\n\nProf. Buhler, in several places of the excellent introductions which he has\nprefixed to his translations of the Dharma-sutras, has called attention to the\nfact that the relation in which the Sutra texts of the same school stand to\neach other is very different in different schools. Many schools possess a\ngreat corpus of Sutras, the parts of which are the _S_ rauta-sutra, the G _ri_\nhya-sutra, &c. This is, for instance, the case with the \xc3\x82pastambiya school 2;\nits Sutra is divided into thirty Pra _s_ nas, the contents of which are\ndivided as follows:\n\nI-XXIV: _S_ rauta-sutra.\n\nXXV: Paribhashas, &c.\n\nXXVI: Mantras for the G _ri_ hya-sutra.\n\nXXVII: G _ri_ hya-sutra.\n\nXXVIII-XXIX: Dharma-sutra.\n\nXXX: _S_ ulva-sutra.\n\nIn other cases the single Sutra texts stand more independently side by side;\nthey are not considered as parts of one and the same great work, but as\ndifferent works. Of course it is the Dharma-sutras above all which could be\nfreed from the connection with the other Sutra texts to such an extent, that\neven their belonging to a distinct Vedic school may be doubtful. The contents\n\np. xxx\n\nof this class of Sutras indeed have hardly any connection with the\nsubdivisions and differences of the Vedic texts handed down in the various\nschools; there was no reason why Brahmans, who studied various _S_ akhas of\nthe Veda, should not learn the ordinances concerning law and morals given in\nthese Sutras as they were formulated in the same texts. The G _ri_ hya-sutras\nare not so independent of the differences of the Vedic schools. The close\nanalogy between the sacrificial ritual of the G _ri_ hya acts and that of the\n_S_ rauta acts, and the consequent necessity of taking into account the _S_\nrauta ritual in the exposition of the G _ri_ hya ritual, necessarily brought\nthe G _ri_ hya-sutras into closer connection with and into greater dependence\non the _S_ rauta-sutras than in the case of the Dharma-sutras 1. But above\nall, the G _ri_ hya ceremonies demanded the knowledge of numerous Mantras, and\naccordingly as these Mantras were borrowed from the one or the ether Mantra\n_S_ akha 2, there followed in the case of the G _ri_ hya text in question an\nintimate connection with the corresponding Mantra school 3. We find\naccordingly as a general rule, that each G _ri_ hya-sutra presupposes a Vedic\nSa _m_ hita, whose Mantras it quotes only in their Pratikas 4, and that\nbesides each G _ri_ hya-sutra presupposes a previous\n\np. xxxi\n\nknowledge of the ritual which is acquired through the study of the proper _S_\nrauta-sutra 1. It is not necessary to quote the numerous places where the G\n_ri_ hya-sutras either expressly refer to the _S_ rauta-sutras, or point to\nthem by repeating the same phrases or often even whole Sutras. It will be\nsufficient to quote one out of many places, the opening words of the \xc3\x82 _s_\nvalayana-G _ri_ hya, which in a way characterise this work as a second part of\nthe _S_ rauta-sutra: \'The rites based on the spreading (of the three sacred\nfires) have been declared; we shall declare the G _ri_ hya rites 2.\'\n\nThus it is not difficult to perceive the dependence of the G _ri_ hya-sutras\non the _S_ rauta-sutras; but there remains the much more difficult question\nwhether in each particular case both texts are to be regarded as by the same\nauthor, or whether the G _ri_ hya-sutra is an appendix to the _S_ rauta-sutra\ncomposed by another author. Tradition accepts the one alternative for some\nSutras; for other Sutras it accepts the other; thus in the domain of the Rig-\nVeda literature \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana and _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana are credited with the\nauthorship of a _S_ rauta-sutra as well as of a G _ri_ hya-sutra; the same is\ntrue of \xc3\x82pastamba, Hira _n_ yake _s_ in, and other authors. On the other hand,\nthe authorship of the G _ri_ hya-sutras which follow the _S_ rauta-sutras of\nKatyayana, La _t_ yayana, Drahyaya _n_ a, is not ascribed to Katyayana, La _t_\nyayana, Drahyaya _n_ a, but to Paraskara, Gobhila, and Khadira _k_ arya.\n\nIt seems to me that we should consider the testimony of tradition as entirely\ntrustworthy in the second class of cases. Tradition is very much inclined to\nascribe to celebrated masters and heads of schools the origin of works which\nare acknowledged authorities in their schools, even though they are not the\nauthors. But it is not likely that tradition should have made a mistake in the\nopposite\n\np. xxxii\n\ndirection, that e.g. it should designate Paraskara as author when Katyayana\nhimself was the author.\n\nWe shall not be able to trust so implicitly to tradition where it puts down\nthe same author for the G _ri_ hya-sutra as for the corresponding _S_ rauta-\nsutra; the possibility that such data are false is so large that we have to\ntreat them as doubtful so long as we have not discovered certain proofs of\ntheir correctness. At present, so far as I can see, we are just as little\njustified in considering that such a proof has been made as we are able to\nprove the opposite state of things. It is easy to find the many agreements in\ncontents and expression which exist, for instance, between the _S_ rauta-sutra\nand G _ri_ hya-sutra of _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana, or between the _S_ rauta-sutra and the\nG _ri_ hya-sutra of \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana 1. But these agreements cannot be\nconsidered as sufficient proof that in each case the G _ri_ hya-sutra and the\n_S_ rauta-sutra are by the same author. Even if the author of the G _ri_ hya-\nsutra was not \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana or _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana in person, still he must have\nbeen at all events perfectly familiar with the works of those teachers, and\nmust have intended to fit his work to theirs as closely as possible, so that\nagreements of this kind can in no way astonish us 2. On the other hand, if the\n_S_ rauta-sutras and G _ri_ hya-sutras are read together, it is easy to\ndiscover small irregularities in the exposition, repetitions and such like,\nwhich might seem to indicate different authors. But the irregularities of this\nkind which have been detected up to the present are scarcely of such\n\np. xxxiii\n\na character as not to be easily ascribable to mistakes and carelessness such\nas even a careful author may be guilty of in the course of a large work 1. It\nseems to me then that until the discovery of further circumstances throwing\nlight on the question of the identity of the authors of the _S_ rautas and of\nthe G _ri_ hyas, it would be premature if we were to venture on a decision of\nthis question in one direction or the other.\n\nProf. Buhler\'s investigations have made perfectly clear the relation in which\nthe G _ri_ hya-sutras and the Dharma-sutras stand to each other in those\ncases, where we have texts of both kinds by the same school. In the case of\nthe G _ri_ hya-sutra and the Dharma-sutra of the \xc3\x82pastambiyas he has proved 2\nthat both texts were the work of the same author according to a common plan,\nso that the G _ri_ hya-sutra is as short and terse as possible, because\n\xc3\x82pastamba had reserved for the Dharma-sutra a portion of the subject-matter\ngenerally treated of in the G _ri_ hya-sutras. Besides there are references in\neach of the two texts to the other which strengthen the proof of their being\nwritten by the same author. In the Sutra collection of Hira _n_ yake _s_ in\nthe state of things is different. Here, as Prof. Buhler has also shown 3, we\nfind numerous discrepancies between the G _ri_ hya and the Dharma-sutra, which\nare owing to the fact, that while this teacher took as Dharma-sutra that of\n\xc3\x82pastamba with some unessential changes, he composed a G _ri_ hya-sutra of his\nown. Of the two Sutras of Baudhayana, the same distinguished scholar, to whom\nwe owe the remarks we have just mentioned, has treated in the Sacred Books of\nthe East, vol. xiv, p. xxxi.\n\nI believe that every reader who compares the two kinds of texts will notice\nthat the frame within which the exposition of the Dharma-sutras is inclosed,\nis an essentially\n\np. xxxiv\n\nbroader one than in the case of the G _ri_ hya-sutras. We have here, I think,\nthe same phenomenon that may also be observed, for instance, in the domain of\nthe Buddhist Vinaya literature, where the exposition of the life of the\ncommunity was at first given only in connection with the explanation of the\nlist of sins (Patimokkha) which was promulgated every half month at the\nmeetings of the spiritual brethren. It was not till later that a more\ncomprehensive exposition, touching all the sides of the life of the community\nwas attempted 1, an exposition which, on the one hand, no longer limited\nitself to the points discussed in the Patimokkha, and which, on the other\nhand, necessarily had much in common with what was laid down in the\nPatimokkha. The relation of the G _ri_ hya-sutras and Dharma-sutras seems to\nme to be of a similar nature. The G _ri_ hya-sutras begin to treat of the\nevents of the daily life of the household, but they do not yet undertake to\nexhaust the great mass of this subject-matter; on the contrary they confine\nthemselves principally to the ritual or sacrificial side of household life, as\nis natural owing to their connection with the older ritualistic literature.\nThen the Dharma-sutras take an important step further; their purpose is to\ndescribe the whole of the rights and customs which prevail in private, civic,\nand public life. They naturally among other things touch upon the ceremonies\ntreated in the G _ri_ hya-sutras, but they generally merely mention them and\ndiscuss the questions of law and custom which are connected with them, without\nundertaking to go into the technical ordinances as to the way in which these\nceremonies are to be performed 2.\n\nOnly in a few cases do portions treated of in the domain of the Dharma-sutras\nhappen to coincide with portions treated of in the G _ri_ hya-sutras. Thus\nespecially, apart from a few objects of less importance, the detailed rules\nfor the behaviour of the Snataka and the rules for the interruptions\n\np. xxxv\n\nof the Veda study (anadhyaya) are generally treated in an exactly similar way\nin the texts of the one and those of the other category.\n\n___________________\n\nWe have spoken above of the metrical peculiarities of the Mantras quoted in\nthe G _ri_ hya-sutras, the metre of which clearly proves what is indubitable\nfrom other reasons, that most, if not all, of these verses were composed at a\nperceptibly older period than the descriptions of the sacred acts in the midst\nof which they are inserted 1. A second kind of verses which are quoted in the\nG _ri_ hya-sutras must be carefully distinguished from these. It is doubtful\nwhether there are any to be found among them which the authors of the Sutras\nhave themselves composed; but they were composed at a period decidedly more\nrecent than those Mantras 2, and they therefore exhibit metrical peculiarities\nwhich are essentially different. The verses I mean are _S_ lokas of ritual\ncontents, which are quoted to confirm or to complete what is stated in the\nprose, and which are introduced by such expressions as tad apy ahu _h_ \'here\nthey say also,\' or tad api _s_ loka _h_ \'here there are also _S_ lokas,\' and\nother similar phrases 3.\n\nWe called attention above (p. xix) to the fact that a verse of this kind\noccurs in one of the G _ri_ hya chapters of the _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a, in\na metre corresponding to the peculiarities of the older literary style. On the\nother hand, the verses appearing in the G _ri_ hya-sutras differ only in a few\ncases from the standard of the later _S_ loka prosody, as we have it, e. g. in\nthe Mahabharata and in the laws of Manu. In the Zeitschrift der Deutschen\nMorgenland. Gesellschaft, vol. xxxvii, p. 67, I have given tables for the\nverses in question out of the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya, and these tables show\nthat the characteristic ending of the first\n\np. xxxvi\n\n[paragraph continues] _S_ loka Pada for the later period  ![](img/_03600.jpg),\nwhich, for instance, in the Nalopakhyana of the Mahabharata covers precisely\nfive-sixths of all the cases, occurs in _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana in thirty cases out of\nthirty-nine, that is in about three quarters of the cases 1; _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana has\nstill twice the ending  ![](img/_03601.jpg) which is the rule in the _Ri_\ng-veda, but which is forbidden by the later prosody: prahuta _h_ pit _ri_\nkarma _n_ a, uktva mantra _m_ sp _ri_ _s_ ed apa _h_  2. It may be observed\nthat a similar treatment of the _S_ loka metre appears also in the _Ri_ g-veda\nPrati _s_ akhya of _S_ aunaka. Here too the modern form of the ending of the\nfirst pada dominates, although sometimes the old iambic form is preserved, e.\ng. II, 5 anta _h_ pada _m_ viv _ri_ ttaya _h_ , III, 6 anudattodaye puna _h_.\n\nIt seems evident that we have in this _S_ loka form of the Sutra period, the\nlast preparatory stage which the development of this metre had to traverse,\nbefore it arrived at the shape which it assumes in epic poetry; and it is to\nbe hoped that more exhaustive observations on this point (account being\nespecially taken of the numerous verses quoted in the Dharma-sutras) will\nthrow an important light on the chronology of the literature of this period\nlying between the Vedas and the post-Vedic age.\n\nWe add to these remarks on the _S_ lokas quoted in the G _ri_ hya-sutras, that\nwe come upon a number of passages in the midst of the prose of the Sutras,\nwhich without being in any way externally designated as verses, have an\nunmistakable metrical character, being evidently verses which the authors of\nthe Sutras found ready made, and which they used for their own aphorisms,\neither without changing them at all, or with such slight changes that the\noriginal form remained clearly recognisable. Thus we read in \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana (G\n_ri_ hya I, 6, 8), as a definition of the Rakshasa marriage: hatva bhittva _k_\na _s_ irsha _n_ i rudati _m_ rudadbhyo\n\np. xxxvii\n\nharet: the approximation of these words to the _S_ loka metre cannot escape\nattention, and it is only necessary to make rudadbhya _h_ and rudati _m_\nchange places in order to obtain a regular _S_ loka hemistich. In Gobhila the\nSutras I, 2, 21-27 represent three hemistichs, which with one exception (na\n_k_ a sopanatka _h_ kva _k_ it) exactly conform to the laws of the Sloka\nmetre. II, 4, 2 gives also a hemistich by slightly changing the order:\n\nMahav _ri_ kshan _s_ ma _s_ ana _m_ _k_ a nadi _s_ _k_ a vishama _n_ i _k_ a\n1.\n\nSomewhat more remote from the original verses is the wording of the Sutras I,\n6, 8. 9 na pravasann upavased ity ahu _h_ , patnya vrata _m_ bhavatiti; we\nhave the metrical order in one of the _S_ lokas quoted by _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana (G\n_ri_ hya II, 17): nopavasa _h_ pravase syat patni dharayate vratam.\n\nThe verses which are thus either expressly quoted, or at any rate made use of\nby the authors of the G _ri_ hya-sutras, do not seem to be taken from\nconnected metrical works any more than the ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ agathas quoted in the\nBrahma _n_ as; on the contrary in a later period of literature, when texts\nsimilar to Manu\'s Code were composed, they evidently furnished these texts\nwith some of their materials 2.\n\n_______________________________\n\nLeaving out of consideration the Khadira-G _ri_ hya, which is evidently a\nrecast of the Gobhiliya-G _ri_ hya, and the Sutra of Hira _n_ yake _s_ in,\nwhich is, at least in part, based on that of \xc3\x82pastamba 3, we are not in regard\nto the other G _ri_ hya texts in a condition to prove that one of them\nborrowed from the other. It often happens that single Sutras or whole rows of\nSutras agree so exactly in different texts that this agreement cannot be\nascribed to chance; but this does not\xc2\x97so far at least\xc2\x97enable us to tell which\ntext is to be looked upon as the source of the\n\np. xxxviii\n\nother, or whether they have a common source which has been lost.\n\nI will content myself with mentioning two such cases of agreement, in the one\nof which we can at least prove that a certain Sutra cannot originally spring\nfrom one of the texts in which we find it, while in the other case we are able\nby means of a possibly not too uncertain conjecture to reconstruct the opening\nSutras of a lost G _ri_ hya-sutra.\n\nThe description of the v _ri_ shotsarga (i.e. of the setting a bull at\nliberty) agrees almost word for word in the Sutras of _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana (III, 11),\nParaskara (III, 9), and in the Ka _th_ aka-G _ri_ hya. In _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana we\nread:\n\n\xc2\xa7 15: nabhyasthe\xe0\xa4\xbdnumantrayate mayobhur ity anuvaka _s_ eshe _n_ a.\n\n(\'When the bull is in the midst of the cows, he recites over them the texts\n"mayobhu _h_ , &c.," down to the end of the Anuvaka.\')\n\nOn the other hand in Paraskara we have:\n\n\xc2\xa7 7: nabhyastham abhimantrayate mayobhur ity anuvaka _s_ eshe _n_ a.\n\n(\'When the bull is in the midst of the cows, he recites over it the texts\n"mayobhu _h_ , &c.," down to the end of the Anuvaka.\')\n\nThe quotation mayobhu _h_ is clear, if we refer it to the _Ri_ g-veda. Hymn X,\n169, which stands about in the middle of an Anuvaka, begins with this word 1.\nOn the other hand in the Va _g_ asaneyi Sa _m_ hita there is no Mantra\nbeginning with Mayobhu _h_ ; we find this word in the middle of the Mantra\nXVIII, 45, and there follow verses whose use at the v _ri_ shotsarga would\nseem in part extremely strange. There can thus be no doubt that Paraskara here\nborrowed from a Sutra text belonging to the _Ri_ g-veda, a Pratika, which,\nwhen referred to the Va _g_ asaneyi Sa _m_ hita, results in nonsense.\n\nThe other passage which I wish to discuss here is Paraskara\n\np. xxxix\n\n[paragraph continues] I, 4,1-5. Paraskara, being just on the point of\ndescribing the marriage ritual, prefixes a few sentences, the position of\nwhich here it is not very easy to understand. A general division of all Pakaya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as\xc2\x97general remarks on the nature of the place for sacrificing: this\nlooks very strange between a discussion of the Arghya and marriage ceremonies.\nNow these same sentences are found almost word for word and with the same\npassing on to the marriage ritual in _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana also (G _ri_ hya I, 5,\n1-5). Here, as in other cases, we have the borrowing word for word of such\nportions of text from an older text, and, closely related to this phenomenon,\nthe fact that the sentences in question are awkwardly woven into the context\nof the G _ri_ hya where we read them, and are poorly connected with the\nsurrounding parts. Unless we are much deceived, we have here a fragment from\nan older source inserted without connection and without change. It would seem\nthat this fragment was the beginning of the original work; for the style and\ncontents of these Sutras are peculiarly appropriate for the beginning. Thus,\nif this conjecture is right, that old lost G _ri_ hya began with the main\ndivision of all the Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as into four classes, and then proceeded at\nonce to the marriage ritual. Later, when the texts which we have, came into\nexistence, the feeling evidently arose, that in this way an important part of\nthe matter had been overlooked. The supplementary matter was then inserted\nbefore the old beginning, which then naturally, as is to be seen in our texts,\njoins on rather strangely and abruptly to these newly-added portions.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[x:1](sbe30002.htm#fr_0) It is doubtful whether at the time of the _Ri_ g-veda\nthe custom was established for the sacrificer to keep burning constantly a\nsacred G _ri_ hya fire besides the three _S_ rauta fires. There is, as far as\nI know, no express mention of the G _ri_ hya fire in the _Ri_ g-veda; but that\nis no proof that it had then not yet come into use. Of the _S_ rauta fires the\ngarhapatya is the only one that is mentioned, though all three were known\nbeyond a doubt. (Ludwig, _Ri_ g-veda, vol. iii, p. 355; in some of the\npassages cited the word garhapatya does not refer to the ga hapatya fire.)\n\n[x:2](sbe30002.htm#fr_1) _Ri_ g-veda X, 85. It is clear that what we have here\nis not a hymn intended to be recited all at once, but that, as in a number of\nother cases in the _Ri_ g-veda, the single verses or groups of verses were to\nbe used at different points in the performance of a rite (or, in other cases,\nin the telling of a story). Compare my paper, \'\xc3\x82khyana-Hymnen im _Ri_ g-veda,\'\nZeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlandischen Gesellschaft, vol. xxxix, p.\n83.\xc2\x97Many verses of _Ri_ g-veda X, 85 occur again in the fourteenth book of the\nAtharva-veda.\n\n[xi:1](sbe30002.htm#fr_2) _Ri_ g-veda X, 14-16, and several other hymns of the\ntenth book.

I have endeavoured in\nthe same paper, p. 65 seq., to make it seem probable that this was the stage\nof prosody prevailing during the government of the two Kuru kings Parikshit\nand _G_ aname _g_ aya.\n\n[xiii:1](sbe30002.htm#fr_9) For instance, in the verses which occur in the\nwell-known story of Suna _h_ _s_ epa (Aitareya-Brahma _n_ a VII, 13 seq.).\n\n[xiii:2](sbe30002.htm#fr_10) \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana-G _ri_ hya I, 15, 2.\n\n[xiii:3](sbe30002.htm#fr_11) Mantra-Brahma _n_ a I, 5, 9; cf.

Taittiriya Sa _m_ hita V, 5, 9, 2, not g _ri_ hya but\ngahya is to be read. Aupasana, _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a XII, 3, 5, 5, seems\nnot to refer to a sacrificial fire. Following the identity of aupasana and\nsabhya maintained in the dictionary under the heading aupasana, one might be\ntempted in a place like _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a II, 3, 2, 3 to refer the\nwords ya esha sabhayam agni _h_ to the domestic fire. A different fire is\nhowever really meant (Katyayana- _S_ rauta-sutra IV, 9, 20).\n\n[xv:2](sbe30002.htm#fr_15) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana I, 1, 1: pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ an\nvyakhyasyama _h_ ; I, 5, 1 =Paraskara I, 4, 1: _k_ atvara _h_ pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a\nhuto\xe0\xa4\xbdhuta _h_ prahuta _h_ pra _s_ ita iti.\n\n[xv:3](sbe30002.htm#fr_16) I, 4, 2, 10: sarvan ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ an . . . ye _k_ a\npakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a ye _k_ etare.\n\n[xv:4](sbe30002.htm#fr_17) I, 7, 1, 3: sarve _n_ a vai ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ena deva _h_\nsuvarga _m_ lokam ayan, pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ena Manur a _s_ ramyat, &c.\n\n[xv:5](sbe30002.htm#fr_18) I, 8, 1, 6 seq.

Prof. Max Muller\'s notes to the passage quoted\nfrom the B _ri_ had \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka. I must mention in this connection a point\ntouched upon by Prof. Muller, loc. cit. p. 222, note 1, viz. that \xc3\x82 _s_\nvalayana, G _ri_ hya I, 13, 1, expressly calls \'the Upanishad\' the text in\nwhich the Pu _m_ savana and similar ceremonies are treated. It is probable\nthat the Upanishad which \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana had in mind treated these rites not as\na duty to which all were bound, but as a secret that assured the realisation\nof certain wishes. This follows from the character of the Upanishads, which\ndid not form a part of the Vedic course which all had to study, but rather\ncontained a secret doctrine intended for the few.\n\n[xxii:1](sbe30002.htm#fr_37) Similarly Gobhila: g _ri_ hyakarma _n_ i.\n\n[xxiii:1](sbe30002.htm#fr_38) I believe with Stenzler (see his translation of\n\xc3\x82 _s_ valayana, pp. 2 seq.) that pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a means \'boiled offering.\' It\nseems to me that the expression paka in this connection cannot be otherwise\ntaken than in the word sthalipaka (\'pot-boiling\'). Prof. Max Muller (History\nof Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 203), following Hindu authorities, explains\nPakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a as \'a small sacrifice,\' or, more probably, \'a good\nsacrifice.\' The definition of La _t_ yayana may be also here quoted (IV, 9,\n2): pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a ity a _k_ akshata ekagnau ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ an.\n\n[xxiii:2](sbe30002.htm#fr_39) Compare, for instance, the account of the\nceremonies which are to be performed for the journey of the newly-married pair\nto their new home, _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya I, 15, or the observances to which\nthe Snataka is bound, Gobhila III, 5, &c. According to the rule _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana\nI, 12, 13 we are, however, to suppose a sacrifice in many ceremonies where\nthere does not seem to be any.\n\n[xxiv:1](sbe30002.htm#fr_40) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana I, 5, 1; 10, 7; Paraskara I, 4, 1.\nDoubtless Prof. Buhler is right in finding the same division mentioned also\nVasish _th_ a XXVI, 10 (Sacred Books of the East, vol. xiv, p. 128). \xc3\x82 _s_\nvalayana (I, 1, s) mentions only three of the four classes.\n\n[xxiv:2](sbe30002.htm#fr_41) In La _t_ yayana (V, 4, 22-24) all the sacrifices\nare divided into seven Havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a-sa _m_ sthas and into seven Soma-sa\n_m_ sthas, so that the Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as do not form a class of their own;\nthey are strangely brought in as the last of the Havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as.

Cf. Weber, Indische Literaturgeschichte,\n2. Aufl., S. 296.\n\n[xxx:2](sbe30002.htm#fr_59) It seems as though the choice of the Mantras which\nwere to be prescribed for the G _ri_ hya ceremonies had often been\nintentionally made so as to comprise as many Mantras as possible occurring in\nthe Mantra-Sakha, which served as foundation to the G _ri_ hya texts in\nquestion.\n\n[xxx:3](sbe30002.htm#fr_60) When Govindasvamin (quoted by Buhler, Sacred Books\nof the East, vol. xiv, p. xiii) designates the G _ri_ hya _s_ astra _n_ i as\nsarvadhikara _n_ i, this should not be understood literally. In general it is\ntrue the G _ri_ hya acts are the same for the disciples of all the Vedic\nschools, but the Mantras to be used in connection with them differ.\n\n[xxx:4](sbe30002.htm#fr_61) In the introduction to Gobhila I have treated of\nthe special case where a G _ri_ hya-sutra, besides being connected with one of\nthe great Sa _m_ hitas, is connected also with a G _ri_ hya-sa _m_ hita of its\nown, so to speak, with a collection of the Mantras to be used at the G _ri_\nhya acts.\n\n[xxxi:1](sbe30002.htm#fr_62) In the domain of the Atharva-veda literature\nalone we find this relation reversed; here the _S_ rauta-sutra (the Vaitana-\nsutra) presupposes the G _ri_ hya-sutra (the Kau _s_ ika-sutra). Cf. Prof.\nGarbe\'s preface to his edition of the Vaitana-sutra, p. vii. This relation is\nnot extraordinary, considering the secondary character of the Vaitana-sutra.\n\n[xxxi:2](sbe30002.htm#fr_63) Uktani vaitanikani, g _ri_ hya _n_ i vakshyama\n_h_.\n\n[xxxii:1](sbe30002.htm#fr_64) The parallel passages from the _S_ rauta-sutra\nand the G _ri_ hya-sutra of the Manavas are brought together in Dr. Von\nBradke\'s interesting paper, \'Ueber das Manava-G _ri_ hya-sutra,\' Zeitschrift\nder Deutschen Morgenland. Gesellschaft, vol. xxxvi, p. 451.\n\n[xxxii:2](sbe30002.htm#fr_65) For this reason I cannot accept the reasoning\nthrough which Prof. Buhler (Sacred Books of the East, vol. ii, p. xiv)\nattempts to prove the identity of the author of the _S_ rauta-sutra and of the\nDharma-sutra of the \xc3\x82pastambiya school. Buhler seems to assume that the\nrepetition of the same Sutra, and of the same irregular grammatical form in\nthe _S_ rauta-sutra and in the Dharma-sutra, must either be purely accidental,\nor, if this is impossible, that it proves the identity of the authors. But\nthere remains a third possible explanation, that the two texts are by\ndifferent authors, one of whom knows and imitates the style of the other.\n\n[xxxiii:1](sbe30002.htm#fr_66) Cf. my remarks in the introduction to the _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya, vol. xxix, pp. 5, 6.\n\n[xxxiii:2](sbe30002.htm#fr_67) Sacred Books of the East, vol. ii, p. xiii seq.\n\n[xxxiii:3](sbe30002.htm#fr_68) Sacred Books of the East, vol. ii, p. xxiii\nseq.\n\n[xxxiv:1](sbe30002.htm#fr_69) In the work which has Khandhaka as its general\ntitle and which has been transmitted to us in two parts, Mahavagga and _K_\nullavagga.\n\n[xxxiv:2](sbe30002.htm#fr_70) Compare, for instance, the explanations\nconcerning the Upanayana in the Dharma-sutras (\xc3\x82pastamba I, 1; Gautama I) with\nthe corresponding sections of the G _ri_ hya-sutras.\n\n[xxxv:1](sbe30002.htm#fr_71) We do not mean to deny that among these verses\ntoo a few of especially modern appearance are to be found; e.g. this is true\nof the verses which Dr. Von Bradke has quoted from the Manava-G _ri_ hya II,\n24, 34 (Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenland. Gesellschaft, vol. xxxvi, p.\n429).\n\n[xxxv:2](sbe30002.htm#fr_72) Let me here refer to the fact that one of these\nverses (\xc3\x82 _s_ valayana-G _ri_ hya IV, 7, 16) concludes with the words, \'thus\nsaid _S_ aunaka.\'\n\n[xxxv:3](sbe30002.htm#fr_73) \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana-G _ri_ hya I, 3, so designates\nsuch a verse as ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ agatha.\n\n[xxxvi:1](sbe30002.htm#fr_74) The few verses which are found in Gobhila\npreserve the same metrical standard as those quoted in _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana; it\nfollows that in Gobhila IV, 7, 23, a _s_ vatthad agnibhaya _m_ bruyat, we\ncannot change bruyat in _k_ a, as Prof. Knauer proposes. The supernumerary\nsyllable of the first foot is unobjectionable, but the form\n![](img/_03602.jpg) of the second foot should not be touched.\n\n[xxxvi:2](sbe30002.htm#fr_75) Both passages are to be found in _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G\n_ri_ hya I, 10.\n\n[xxxvii:1](sbe30002.htm#fr_76) The text has: = nadi _s_ _k_ a vishama _n_ i\n_k_ a mahav _ri_ kshan _s_ ma _s_ ana _m_ _k_ a.\n\n[xxxvii:2](sbe30002.htm#fr_77) Cf. Indische Studien, XV, 11. We do not mean to\nimply anything as to the metrical portions of other Sutra texts than the G\n_ri_ hya-sutras. As regards some verses quoted in the Baudhayana-Dharma-sutra,\nProf. Buhler (Sacred Books of the East, vol. xiv, p. xli) has shown that they\nare actually borrowed from a metrical treatise on the Sacred Law.\n\n[xxxvii:3](sbe30002.htm#fr_78) Cf. Prof. Buhler\'s remarks, Sacred Books of the\nEast, vol. ii, p. xxiii.\n\n[xxxviii:1](sbe30002.htm#fr_79) In the Taittiriya Sa _m_ hita (VII, 4, 17)\nmayobhu _h_ is the beginning of an Anuvaka; the expression anuvaka _s_ eshe\n_n_ a would have no meaning if referred to this text.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Introduction](sbe30003.htm)\n\n'
