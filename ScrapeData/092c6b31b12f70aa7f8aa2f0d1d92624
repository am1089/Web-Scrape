The\nUpanishads were translated from Sanskrit into Persian by, or, it may be, for\nDara Shukoh, the eldest son of Shah Jehan, an enlightened prince, who openly\nprofessed the liberal religious tenets of the great Emperor Akbar, and even\nwrote a book intended to reconcile the religious doctrines of Hindus and\nMohammedans. He seems first to have heard of the Upanishads during his stay in\nKashmir in 1640. He afterwards invited several Pandits from Benares to Delhi,\nwho were to assist him in the work of translation. The translation was\nfinished in 1657. Three years after the accomplishment of this work, in 1659,\nthe prince was put to death by his brother Aurangzib 1, in reality, no doubt,\nbecause he was the eldest son and legitimate successor of Shah Jehan, but\nunder the pretext that he was an infidel, and dangerous to the established\nreligion of the empire.\n\nWhen the Upanishads had once been translated from Sanskrit into Persian, at\nthat time the most widely read language of the East and understood likewise by\nmany European scholars, they became generally accessible to\n\np. lviii\n\nall who took an interest in the religious literature of India. It is true that\nunder Akbar's reign (1556-1586) similar translations had been prepared 1, but\nneither those nor the translations of Dara Shukoh attracted the attention of\nEuropean scholars till the year 1775. In that year Anquetil Duperron, the\nfamous traveller and discoverer of the Zend-avesta, received one MS. of the\nPersian translation of the Upanishads, sent to him by M. Gentil, the French\nresident at the court of Shuja ud daula, and brought to France by M. Bernier.\nAfter receiving another MS., Anquetil Duperron collated the two, and\ntranslated the Persian translation 2 into French (not published), and into\nLatin. That Latin translation was published in 1801 and 1802, under the title\nof 'Oupnek'hat, id est, Secretum tegendum: opus ipsa in India rarissimum,\ncontinens antiquam et arcanam, seu theologicam et philosophicam doctrinam, e\nquatuor sacris Indorum libris Rak baid, Djedjer baid, Sam baid, Athrban baid\nexcerptam; ad verbum, e Persico idiomate, Samkreticis vocabulis intermixto, in\nLatinum conversum: Dissertationibus et Annotationibus difficiliora\nexplanantibus, illustratum: studio et opera Anquetil Duperron, Indicopleustae.\nArgentorati, typis et impensis fratrum Levrault, vol. i, 1801; vol. ii, 1802\n3.'\n\nThis translation, though it attracted considerable interest among scholars,\nwas written in so utterly unintelligible a style, that it required the\nlynxlike perspicacity of an intrepid\n\np. lix\n\nphilosopher, such as Schopenhauer, to discover a thread through such a\nlabyrinth. Schopenhauer, however, not only found and followed such a thread,\nbut he had the courage to proclaim to an incredulous age the vast treasures of\nthought which were lying buried beneath that fearful jargon.\n\nAs Anquetil Duperron's volumes have become scarce, I shall here give a short\nspecimen of his translation, which corresponds to the first sentences of my\ntranslation of the _Kh_ andogya-upanishad (p. 1):--'Oum hoc verbum (esse)\nadkit ut sciveris, sic \xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb8 maschghouli fac (de co meditare), quod ipsum hoc\nverbum aodkit est; propter illud quod hoc (verbum) oum, in Sam Beid, cum voce\nalta, cum harmonia pronunciatum fiat.\n\n'Adkiteh porro cremor (optimum, selectissimum) est: quemadmodum ex (prae) omni\nquieto (non moto), et moto, pulvis (terra) cremor (optimum) est; et e (prae)\nterra aqua cremor est; et ex aqua, comedendum (victus) cremor est; (et) e\ncomedendo, comedens cremor est; et e comedente, loquela (id quod dicitur)\ncremor est; et e loquela, aiet \xcf\x84\xce\xbf\xe1\xbf\xa6 Beid, et ex aiet, \xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb8 siam, id est, cum\nharmonia (pronunciatum); et e Sam, \xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb8 adkit, cremor est; id est, oum, voce\nalta, cum harmonia pronunciare, aokit, cremor cremorum (optimum optimorum)\nest. Major, ex (prae) adkit, cremor alter non est.'\n\nSchopenhauer not only read this translation carefully, but he makes no secret\nof it, that his own philosophy is powerfully impregnated by the fundamental\ndoctrines of the Upanishads. He dwells on it again and again, and it seems\nboth fair to Schopenhauer's memory and highly important for a true\nappreciation of the philosophical value of the Upanishads, to put together\nwhat that vigorous thinker has written on those ancient rhapsodies of truth.\n\nIn his 'Welt als Wille und Vorstellung,' he writes, in the preface to the\nfirst edition, p. xiii:\n\n'If the reader has also received the benefit of the Vedas, the access to which\nby means of the Upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this\nstill young century (1818) may claim before all previous centuries, (for I\nanticipate that the influence of Sanskrit literature will not be less profound\n\np. lx\n\nthan the revival of Greek in the fourteenth century,)--if then the reader, I\nsay, has received his initiation in primeval Indian wisdom, and received it\nwith an open heart, he will be prepared in the very best way for hearing what\nI have to tell him. It will not sound to him strange, as to many others, much\nless disagreeable; for I might, if it did not sound conceited, contend that\nevery one of the detached statements which constitute the Upanishads, may be\ndeduced as a necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which I have to\nenunciate, though those deductions themselves are by no means to be found\nthere.'\n\nAnd again 1:\n\n'If I consider how difficult it is, even with the assistance of the best and\ncarefully educated teachers, and with all the excellent philological\nappliances collected in the course of this century, to arrive at a really\ncorrect, accurate, and living understanding of Greek and Roman authors, whose\nlanguage was after all the language of our own predecessors in Europe, and the\nmother of our own, while Sanskrit, on the contrary, was spoken thousands of\nyears ago in distant India, and can be learnt only with appliances which are\nas yet very imperfect;--if I add to this the impression which the translations\nof Sanskrit works by European scholars, with very few exceptions, produce on\nmy mind, I cannot resist a certain suspicion that our Sanskrit scholars do not\nunderstand their texts much better than the higher class of schoolboys their\nGreek. Of course, as they are not boys, but men of knowledge and\nunderstanding, they put together, out of what they do understand, something\nlike what the general meaning may have been, but much probably creeps in ex\ningenio. It is still worse with the Chinese of our European Sinologues.\n\n'If then I consider, on the other hand, that Sultan Mohammed Dara Shukoh, the\nbrother of Aurangzib, was born and bred in India, was a learned, thoughtful,\nand enquiring man, and therefore probably understood his Sanskrit about as\nwell as we our Latin, that moreover\n\np. lxi\n\nhe was assisted by a number of the most learned Pandits, all this together\ngives me at once a very high opinion of his translation of the Vedic\nUpanishads into Persian. If, besides this, I see with what profound and quite\nappropriate reverence Anquetil Duperron has treated that Persian translation,\nrendering it in Latin word by word, retaining, in spite of Latin grammar, the\nPersian syntax, and all the Sanskrit words which the Sultan himself had left\nuntranslated, though explaining them in a glossary, I feel the most perfect\nconfidence in reading that translation, and that confidence soon receives its\nmost perfect justification. For how entirely does the Oupnekhat breathe\nthroughout the holy spirit of the Vedas! How is every one who by a diligent\nstudy of its Persian Latin has become familiar with that incomparable book,\nstirred by that spirit to the very depth of his soul! How does every line\ndisplay its firm, definite, and throughout harmonious meaning! From every\nsentence deep, original, and sublime thoughts arise, and the whole is pervaded\nby a high and holy and earnest spirit. Indian air surrounds us, and original\nthoughts of kindred spirits. And oh, how thoroughly is the mind here washed\nclean of all early engrafted Jewish superstitions, and of all philosophy that\ncringes before those superstitions! In the whole world there is no study,\nexcept that of the originals, so beneficial and so elevating as that of the\nOupnekhat. It has been the solace of my life, it will be the solace of my\ndeath!\n\n'Though 1 I feel the highest regard for the religious and philosophical works\nof Sanskrit literature, I have not been able to derive much pleasure from\ntheir poetical compositions. Nay, they seem to me sometimes as tasteless and\nmonstrous as the sculpture of India.\n\n'In 2 most of the pagan philosophical writers of the first Christian centuries\nwe see the Jewish theism, which, as Christianity, was soon to become the faith\nof the people, shining through, much as at present we may perceive shining\nthrough in the writings of the learned, the native\n\np. lxii\n\npantheism of India, which is destined sooner or later to become the faith of\nthe people. Ex oriente lux.'\n\nThis may seem strong language, and, in some respects, too strong. But I\nthought it right to quote it here, because, whatever may be urged against\nSchopenhauer, he was a thoroughly honest thinker and honest speaker, and no\none would suspect him of any predilection for what has been so readily called\nIndian mysticism. That Schelling and his school should use rapturous language\nabout the Upanishads, might carry little weight with that large class of\nphilosophers by whom everything beyond the clouds of their own horizon is\nlabelled mysticism. But that Schopenhauer should have spoken of the Upanishads\nas 'products of the highest wisdom' (Ausgeburt der hochsten Weisheit) 1, that\nhe should have placed the pantheism there taught high above the pantheism of\nBruno, Malebranche, Spinoza, and Scotus Erigena, as brought to light again at\nOxford in 1681 2, may perhaps secure a more considerate reception for these\nrelics of ancient wisdom than anything that I could say in their favour.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[lvii:1](sbe01010.htm#fr_14) Elphinstone, History of India, ed.
