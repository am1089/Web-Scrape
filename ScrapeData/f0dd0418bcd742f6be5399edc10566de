When Vish _n_ u had finished his speech[1], the goddess of the earth\ninclined her knees and her head before him and said:\n\n2\\. \'O Bhagavat! Four (out of the five) grosser elements[1] are receiving\ntheir support from thee, and are constantly about thee: the ether, in the form\nof the shell; the air, in the form of the discus; the fire, in the form of the\nmace; and the water, in the form of the lotus. Now I also desire to attend\nupon thee, in my own shape, as the ground which Bhagavat\'s feet tread upon.\'\n\n[21. 1 The \'field\' has been discussed in XCVI, 43-97, \'knowledge\' in XCVI,\n43-97, \'knowledge\' in XCVII, 1, and \'what should be known\' in XCVII, 2-20.\n(Nand.)\n\nXCVII. 1. 1 Vish _n_ u\'s speech is contained in Chapters II-XCVII. (Nand.)\n\n2\\. 1 The fifth grosser element is the earth. See XCVII, 1, note.]\n\np. 292\n\n3\\. Having been addressed thus by the goddess of the earth, Bhagavat answered,\n\'So be it.\'\n\n4\\. And the goddess of the earth, her desire having been gratified, did as she\nhad said.\n\n5\\. And she praised the god of the gods (as follows):\n\n6\\. \'Om. Adoration be to thee.\n\n7\\. \'Thou art the god of the gods.\n\n8\\. \'Thou art Vasudeva.\n\n9\\. \'Thou art the creator.\n\n10\\. \'Thou art the god (who, creates, preserves, and destroys) at will.\n\n11\\. \'Thou art the gratifier of human desires.\n\n12\\. \'Thou art the guardian of the earth.\n\n13\\. \'There is neither beginning, nor middle, nor end in thee.\n\n14\\. \'Thou art the lord (protector) of creatures.\n\n15\\. \'Thou art the strong lord of creatures.\n\n16\\. \'Thou art the exalted lord of creatures.\n\n17\\. \'Thou art the lord of strength.\n\n18\\. \'Thou art the lord of holy speech.\n\n19\\. \'Thou art the lord (creator and preserver) of the world.\n\n20\\. \'Thou art the lord of heaven.\n\n21\\. \'Thou art the lord of woods (who makes the trees grow).\n\n[10. \'Or Kamadeva means the god (or brilliant one) who is sought by those\nstriving for religious merit, gain, love, or final liberation,\' (Nand.) The\nsame interpretation is given by _S_ a _n_ kara in his Commentary on the Vish\n_n_ u-sahasranama. The ordinary meaning of Kamadeva is \'the god of love.\'\n\n15, 16. Nand. renders the terms supra _g_ apati and mahapra _g_ apati by \'the\nprotector of those who have a splendid progeny (such as Ka _s_ yapa)\' and the\nlord of him who has a large progeny (Brahman).\']\n\np. 293\n\n22\\. \'Thou art the lord (producer) of (mother\'s) milk.\n\n23\\. \'Thou art the lord of the earth (and causest it to yield its produce)\n\n24\\. \'Thou art the lord of the waters.\n\n25\\. \'Thou art the lord of the (eight) quarters of the sky.\n\n26\\. \'Thou art the lord of (the principle) Mahat.\n\n27\\. \'Thou art the lord of the wind.\n\n28\\. \'Thou art the lord of happiness.\n\n29\\. \'Thou art Brahman personified.\n\n30\\. \'Thou art dear to Brahma _n_ as.\n\n31\\. \'Thou pervadest everything.\n\n32\\. \'Thou surpassest all conception.\n\n33\\. \'Thou art attainable by knowledge (meditation).\n\n34\\. \'Thou art invoked at many (offerings).\n\n35\\. \'Thou art praised with many (hymns of the Veda).\n\n36\\. \'Thou likest everything sacred.\n\n37\\. \'Thou art fond of Brahman (the Veda).\n\n38\\. \'Thou belongest to the (gods called) Brahmakayas.\n\n39\\. \'Thy size is immense.\n\n40\\. \'Thou belongest to the Mahara _g_ as.\n\n[26. See XCVII, 1, note.\n\n28\\. Lakshmipati has been translated according to Nand.\'s interpretation. It\nusually denotes the husband of Lakshmi.\n\n30\\. Or \'Brahma _n_ as are dear to thee.\' Both explanations of the term brahma\n_n_ apriya are admissible, and mentioned by Nand. and by _S_ a _n_ kara.\n\n40, 41. Nand. interprets the two terms mahara _g_ ika and _k_ aturmahara _g_\nika by \'he whose series of transmigrations is immense,\' and \'he whose immense\nseries of transmigrations is fourfold,\' and {footnote p. 394} he refers the\nlatter epithet to the four parts, of which Purusha is said to consist. He\nquotes Rig-veda X, 90, 4, where it is said that Purusha ascended to the sky\nwith three of his constituent parts, and that the fourth remained in this\nworld. But both terms cannot be separated etymologically from Mahara _g_ a,\nthe name of a certain class of deities in the Buddhistic system of religion.]\n\np. 294\n\n41\\. \'Thou belongest to the four Mahara _g_ as.\n\n42\\. \'Thou art brilliant.\n\n43\\. \'Thou art most brilliant.\n\n44\\. \'Thou art the seven (parts of a Saman, or the seven divisions of the\nuniverse).\n\n45\\. \'Thou art most blessed.\n\n46\\. \'Thou art tone.\n\n47\\. \'Thou art Tushita (or "satisfied with the honours shown to thee by\nfaithful attendants").\n\n48\\. \'Thou art Mahatushita (or "highly satisfied even without being\nworshipped").\n\n49\\. \'Thou art the tormentor (destroyer of the world).\n\n50\\. \'Thou art wholly created.\n\n51\\. \'Thou art uncreated.\n\n52\\. \'Thou art obsequious (to thy followers).\n\n53\\. \'Thou art sacrifice.\n\n54, \'Thou art the (recipient of the) great sacrifice.\n\n55\\. \'Thou art connected with sacrifices.\n\n56\\. \'Thou art the fit recipient of offerings.\n\n57\\. Thou art the consummation of offerings.\n\n58\\. Thou art invincible.\n\n[44. Thus Nand. Compare I, 56, note.\n\n46\\. Nand.\'s interpretation of the epithet svara, \'tone\' (or \'air breathed\nthrough the nostrils\'), as being a compound of the prefix su and the root _ri_\nin the sense of \'acquisition, insight,\' and meaning \'most wise,\' is\ninadmissible.\n\n54\\. This epithet, according to Nand., refers to the sacrifice mentioned in a\ntext of the Va _g_ asan. Sa _m_ hita (XIX, 12), which begins with the words\n\'The gods prepared a sacrifice\']\n\np. 295\n\n59\\. \'Thou art Vaiku _nth_ a.\n\n60\\. \'Thou art unbounded (both in time and space).\n\n61\\. \'Thou surpassest (the organs of sense, mind, and intelligence).\n\n62\\. \'Thou art of old.\n\n63\\. \'Thou art friendly to the gods.\n\n64\\. \'Thou art the protector of living beings.\n\n65\\. \'Thou wearest radiant locks of hair.\n\n66\\. \'Thou takest thy share of acts of worship.\n\n67\\. \'Thou takest thy sacrificial cake.\n\n68\\. \'Thou art lord over everything.\n\n69\\. \'Thou art the support of all.\n\n70\\. \'Thy ears are pure.\n\n71\\. \'Never ceasing homage is paid to thee.\n\n72\\. \'Thou art blazing fire (or "Thou art shining with clarified butter\noffered up to thee").\n\n73\\. \'Thou cuttest (foes) to pieces with thy axe.\n\n74\\. \'Thou hast a lotus springing from thy navel.\n\n75\\. \'Thou holdest a lotus (in thy hand).\n\n76\\. \'Thou wearest a garland of lotus-flowers.\n\n77\\. \'Thou art the lord of the senses.\n\n78\\. \'Thou hast one horn.\n\n[59. Nand. proposes two interpretations of this epithet: 2. the producer of\nMaya (the power of illusion); 2. the son of Vikun _th_ a, the mother of Vish\n_n_ u in one of his Avataras. Vaikun _th_ a is also the name of Vish _n_ u\'s\nparadise.\n\n70\\. \'I.e. "thou hearest the sacred revelation." Or _s_ u _k_ i _s_ rava = "he\nwhose names are pure."\' (Nand.) The same interpretation is given by _S_ a _n_\nkara. See also Mahabharata XII, 13250.\n\n73\\. \'The epithet kha _nd_ apara _s_ u refers either to Vish _n_ u\'s slaying\nthe Daityas in the form of _S_ iva, or to his wearing an axe as the slayer of\nthe Kshatriyas in the form of Para _s_ urama.\' (Nand.) The latter\ninterpretation is proposed by _S_ a _n_ kara also, and kha _nd_ aparasu is a\nvery common epithet of Para _s_ urama.\n\n78\\. The one horn is meant, by which Vish _n_ u, in his descent as {footnote\np. 296} a fish, is said to have dragged the ship of Manu behind him. (Nand.)]\n\np. 296\n\n79\\. \'Thou art the great boar.\n\n80\\. \'Thou art the tormentor (of the Asuras, or of the righteous and the\nunrighteous).\n\n81\\. \'Thou art eternal.\n\n82\\. \'Thou art infinite. 83. Thou art Purusha. 84. Thou art the great\n(unbounded) Purusha. 85. Thou art (the sage) Kapila. 86. Thou art the teacher\nof the Sa _n_ khya. 87. Thy powers are everywhere. 88. Thou art virtue. 89.\nThou art the giver of virtue. go. Thy body is virtue (law). 91. Thou art the\ngiver of both virtue and wealth. 92. Desires are gratified by thee. 93. Thou\nart Vish _n_ u. 94. Thou art triumphant everywhere. 95. Thou art capable of\nbearing (the extremities of heat and cold and any others). 96. Thou art K _ri_\nsh _n_ a. 97. Thou art the lotus-eyed god. 98. Thou art Naraya _n_ a (the son\nof Nara). 99. Thou art the final aim. 100. Thou art the resort of all beings.\n101. Adoration, adoration (be to thee)!\'\n\n102\\. The goddess of the earth, after her desire had been gratified, and after\nshe had thus praised\n\n[79. This epithet refers to Vish _n_ u\'s boar-incarnation. See I, 1 seq.\n\n85, 86. See Introduction.\n\n101\\. Nand. observes that the divers epithets which are given to Vish _n_ u in\nthis chapter are precisely equal in number to the ninety-six chapters, of\nwhich the law part of the Vish _n_ u-sutra is composed. This coincidence is\ncurious enough, though it is not quite perfect. For it is by a highly\nartificial interpretation only that Nand. makes out Sutra 101 to contain an\nepithet of Vish _n_ u, viz. by interpreting the two separate words namo nama\nas a compound, meaning \'he who is worshipped by the worshipful, i. e. by\nBrahman and the other gods;\' and Sutra 6 contains no epithet at all.]\n\np. 297\n\n(Vish _n_ u) with a cheerful mind I addressed herself to the goddess\n(Lakshmi).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XCIX.](sbe07101.htm)\n\n'
