On account of the impossibility of (the gods being qualified) for the\nmadhu-vidya, &c., _G_ aimini (maintains) the non-qualification (of the gods\nfor the Brahma-vidya).\n\nA new objection is raised against the averment that the gods, &c. also are\nentitled to the knowledge of Brahman. The teacher, _G_ aimini, considers the\ngods and similar beings not to have any claim.--Why?--On account of the\nimpossibility, in the case of the so-called Madhu-vidya, &c. If their claim to\nthe knowledge of Brahman were admitted, we should have to admit their claim to\nthe madhu-vidya ('the knowledge of the honey') also, because that also is a\nkind of knowledge not different (from the knowledge of Brahman). But to admit\nthis latter claim is not possible; for, according to the passage, 'The Sun is\nindeed the honey of the devas' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 1, 1), men are to meditate on\nthe sun (the god \xc3\x82ditya) under the form of honey, and how, if the gods\nthemselves are admitted as meditating worshippers, can \xc3\x82ditya meditate upon\nanother \xc3\x82ditya?--Again, the text, after having enumerated five kinds of\nnectar, the red one, &c. residing in the sun, and after having stated that the\nfive classes of gods, viz. the Vasus, Rudras, \xc3\x82dityas, Maruts, and Sadhyas,\nlive on one of these nectars each, declares that 'he who thus knows this\nnectar becomes one of the Vasus, with Agni at their head, he sees the nectar\nand rejoices, &c., and indicates thereby that those who know the nectars\nenjoyed by the Vasus, &c., attain the greatness of the Vasus, &c. But how\nshould the Vasus themselves know other Vasus enjoying the nectar, and what\nother Vasu-greatness should they desire to attain?--We have also to compare\nthe passages 'Agni is one foot, \xc3\x82ditya is one foot, the quarters are one foot'\n( _Kh_. Up. III, 18, 2); 'Air is indeed the absorber' ( _Kh_. Up. IV, 3, 1);\n'\xc3\x82ditya is Brahman, this is the doctrine.' All these passages treat of the\nmeditation on the Self of certain divinities, for which meditation these\ndivinities themselves\n\np. 217\n\nare not qualified.--So it is likewise impossible that the _ri_ shis themselves\nshould be qualified for meditations connected with _ri_ shis, such as\nexpressed in passages like B _ri_. Up. II, 2, 4, 'These two are the _ri_ shis\nGautama and Bharadva _g_ a; the right Gautama, the left Bharadva _g_ a.'--\nAnother reason for the non-qualification of the gods is stated in the\nfollowing Sutra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 32](sbe34101.htm)\n\n"
