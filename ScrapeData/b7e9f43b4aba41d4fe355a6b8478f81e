Brahman obtained the victory for the Devas. The Devas became elated by the\nvictory of Brahman,\n\np. 150\n\nand they thought, this victory is ours only, this greatness is ours only.\n\n2\\. Brahman perceived this and appeared to them. But they did not know it, and\nsaid: 'What sprite (yaksha or yakshya) is this?'\n\n3\\. They said to Agni (fire): 'O _G_ atavedas, find out what sprite this is.'\n'Yes,' he said.\n\n4\\. He ran toward it, and Brahman said to him: 'Who are you?' He replied: 'I\nam Agni, I am _G_ atavedas.'\n\n5\\. Brahman said: 'What power is in you?' Agni replied: 'I could burn all\nwhatever there is on earth.'\n\n6\\. Brahman put a straw before him, saying: 'Burn this.' He went towards it\nwith all his might, but he could not burn it. Then he returned thence and\nsaid: 'I could not find out what sprite this is.'\n\n7\\. Then they said to Vayu (air): 'O Vayu, find out what sprite this is.'\n'Yes,' he said.\n\n8\\. He ran toward it, and Brahman said to him: 'Who are you?' He replied: 'I\nam Vayu, I am Matari _s_ van.'\n\n9\\. Brahman said: 'What power is in you?' Vayu replied: 'I could take up all\nwhatever there is on earth.'\n\n10\\. Brahman put a straw before him, saying: 'Take it up.' He went towards it\nwith all his might, but he could not take it up. Then he returned thence and\nsaid: 'I could not find out what sprite this is.'\n\n11\\. Then they said to Indra: 'O Maghavan, find out what sprite this is.' He\nwent towards it, but it disappeared from before him.\n\n12\\. Then in the same space (ether) he came\n\np. 151\n\ntowards a woman, highly adorned: it was Uma, the daughter of Himavat 1. He\nsaid to her: 'Who is that sprite?'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[149:2](sbe01178.htm#fr_372) This kha _n_ _d_ a is generally represented as a\nlater addition, but its prose style has more of a Brahma _n_ a character than\nthe verses in the preceding kha _n_ _d_ as, although their metrical structure\nis irregular, and may be taken as a sign of antiquity.\n\n[151:1](sbe01178.htm#fr_373) Uma may here be taken as the wife of _S_ iva,\ndaughter of Himavat, better known by her earlier name, Parvati, the daughter\nof the mountains. Originally she was, not the daughter of the mountains or of\nthe Himalaya, but the daughter of the cloud, just as Rudra was originally, not\nthe lord of the mountains, giri _s_ a, but the lord of the clouds. We are,\nhowever, moving here in a secondary period of Indian thought, in whi.ch we\nsee, as among Semitic nations, the manifested powers, and particularly the\nknowledge and wisdom of the gods, represented by their wives. Uma means\noriginally flax, from va, to weave, and the same word may have been an old\nname of wife, she who weaves (cf. duhit _ri_ ; spinster, and possibly wife\nitself, if O. H. G. wib is connected with O. H. G. weban). It is used almost\nsynonymously with ambika, Taitt. \xc3\x82r. p. 839. If we wished to take liberties,\nwe might translate uma haimavati by an old woman coming from the Himavat\nmountains; but I decline all responsibility for such an interpretation.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Khanda IV](sbe01179.htm)\n\n"
