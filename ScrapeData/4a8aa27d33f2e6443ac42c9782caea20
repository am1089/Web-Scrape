Or (if) in consequence of the existence of knowledge, &c. (Vasudeva, &c.\nbe taken as Lords), yet there is non-exclusion of that (i.e. the objection\nraised in Sutra 42).\n\nLet us then--the Bhagavatas may say--understand by Sa _n_ karsha _n_ a, and so\non, not the individual soul, the mind, &c., but rather Lords, i.e. powerful\nbeings distinguished by all the qualities characteristic of rulers, such as\npre-eminence of knowledge and ruling capacity, strength, valour, glory.\n\np. 442\n\nAll these are Vasudevas free from faults, without a substratum (not sprung\nfrom pradhana), without any imperfections. Hence the objection urged in Sutra\n42 does not apply.\n\nEven on this interpretation of your doctrine, we reply, the 'non-exclusion of\nthat,' i.e. the non-exclusion of the impossibility of origination, can be\nestablished.--Do you, in the first place, mean to say that the four individual\nLords, Vasudeva, and so on, have the same attributes, but do not constitute\none and the same Self?--If so, you commit the fault of uselessly assuming more\nthan one Lord, while all the work of the Lord can be done by one. Moreover,\nyou offend thereby against your own principle, according to which there is\nonly one real essence, viz. the holy. Vasudeva.--Or do you perhaps mean to say\nthat from the one highest Being there spring those four forms possessing equal\nattributes?--In that case the objection urged in Sutra 42 remains valid. For\nSa _n_ karsha _n_ a cannot be produced from Vasudeva, nor Pradyumna from Sa\n_n_ karsha _n_ a, nor Aniruddha from Pradyumna, since (the attributes of all\nof them being the same) there is no supereminence of any one of them.\nObservation shows that the relation of cause and effect requires some\nsuperiority on the part of the cause--as, for instance, in the case of the\nclay and the jar (where the cause is more extensive than the effect)--and that\nwithout such superiority the relation is simply impossible. But the followers\nof the Pa _\xc3\xb1 k_aratra do not acknowledge any difference founded on superiority\nof knowledge, power, &c. between Vasudeva and the other Lords, but simply say\nthat they all are forms of Vasudeva, without any special distinctions. The\nforms of Vasudeva cannot properly be limited to four, as the whole world, from\nBrahman down to a blade of grass, is understood to be a manifestation of the\nsupreme Being.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 45](sbe34221.htm)\n\n"
