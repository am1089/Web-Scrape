In some books Brahm\xc4\x81 is said to be the first cause of all\nthings, in others it is as strongly asserted that Vishnu has this honour;\nwhile in others it is claimed for Siva. As Brahm\xc4\x81\'s special work is creation,\nthat of Vishnu is preservation. In the following passage from the "Padma\nPur\xc4\x81na," it is taught that Vishnu is the supreme cause, thus identifying him\nwith Brahma, and also that his special work is _to preserve:_ --"In the\nbeginning of creation, the great Vishnu, desirous of creating the whole world,\nbecame threefold; Creator, Preserver, Destroyer. In order to create this\nworld, the Supreme Spirit produced from the right side of his body himself as\nBrahm\xc4\x81; then, in order to preserve the world, he produced from his left side\nVishnu; and in order to destroy the world, he produced from the middle of his\nbody the eternal Siva. Some worship Brahm\xc4\x81, others Vishnu, others Siva; but\nVishnu, one yet threefold, creates, preserves, and destroys: therefore let the\npious make no difference between the three."\n\np. 117\n\nThe essence of the teaching of the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na" is given in a few lines. *\n"Listen to the complete compendium of the Pur\xc4\x81na according to its tenor. The\nworld was produced from Vishnu; it exists in him; he\n\n[![VISHNU.](tn/11700.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/11700.jpg)  \nVISHNU.  \n\nis the cause of its continuance and cessation; he is the world." Immediately\nafterwards is a hymn addressed to him which commences as follows:--"Glory to\nthe unchangeable, holy, eternal, supreme Vishnu, of one\n\np. 118\n\nuniversal nature, the mighty over all; to him who is Hir\xc4\x81nyagarbha (Brahm\xc4\x81),\nHari (Vishnu), and Sankara (Siva); the Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer of\nthe world." As will be noticed later on, Siva is commonly called Mah\xc4\x81deva (the\ngreat god). By those who make him the supreme object of worship, Vishnu is\ncommonly called N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81yana, though this was originally a name of Brahm\xc4\x81. These\ngenerally, to a large extent, disregard his incarnations, and address their\npraise to him as the greatest of all. And frequently he is indicated by the\nword Ishwar (God), as though he were _the_ God. But this term is far more\nfrequently employed for Siva.\n\n"The word Vishnu in the Pur\xc4\x81nas is generally said to be derived from the root\n_vis_ (to enter); entering in or pervading the universe, agreeably to the text\nof the Vedas: \'Having created that (world), he then afterwards enters into\nit.\' According to the \'Matsya Pur\xc4\x81na,\' the name alludes to his entering into\nthe mundane egg; according to the \'Padma Pur\xc4\x81na,\' it refers to his entering\ninto or combining with Prakriti, as Purush or spirit." *\n\nIn the "Bh\xc4\x81gavata Pur\xc4\x81na" \xe2\x80\xa0 is the following legend to show the superiority of\nVishnu:--"Once when the holy sages were performing a sacrifice on the banks of\nthe Sarasvati, a dispute arose amongst them as to which of the three gods was\ngreatest. They sent Bhrigu, the son of Brahm\xc4\x81, to ascertain this point. He\nfirst went to the heaven of Brahm\xc4\x81, and, desirous of discovering the truth,\nentered his court without paying him the usual honours. Incensed at this\ndisrespect, Brahm\xc4\x81, glowed with anger; but recollecting that it was caused by\nhis own son, he assuaged the fire of wrath which had risen in his mind. Bhrigu\nthen proceeded to Kailasa;\n\np. 119\n\nbut when Maheshwara (Siva) hastened to embrace him as a brother, he turned\naway from the proffered embrace. Enraged at such misconduct, the god, seizing\nhis trident, prepared to kill the divine sage; but Parvati fell at his feet,\nand by her words appeased the anger of her lord. Bhrigu next went to Vishnu\'s\nheaven, and kicked the god\'s breast, as he lay slumbering in the lap of\nLakshmi. The lord, rising from his couch, and bowing respectfully to Bhrigu,\nthus addressed him: \'Welcome to thee, O Br\xc4\x81hman! Be seated for a little, and\ndeign to excuse the fault which through ignorance I have committed [in not\nperforming duties due to a guest], and the hurt which your tender foot must\nhave received!\' Having thus spoken, he rubbed the foot of Bhrigu with his own\nhands, and added, \'To-day am I a highly honoured vessel, since thou, O lord!\nhast imprinted on my breast the dust of thy sin-dispelling foot.\' When Vishnu\nhad finished speaking, Bhrigu was so affected by these benevolent words, that\nhe was unable to reply, and departed in silence, whilst tears of devout\nemotion rushed from his eyes. On his narrating his adventures to the saints on\nthe banks of the Sarasvati, their doubts were immediately dispelled; they\nbelieved Vishnu to be the greatest of the three gods, because he was exempt\nfrom impatience and passion."\n\nIn the "Padma Pur\xc4\x81na " * Siva is represented as admitting Vishnu\'s superiority\nto himself. Addressing his wife, he says: "I will acquaint thee with the real\nessence and form of Vishnu: know then that he is in truth N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81yana, the\nSupreme Spirit, and Parabrahma (the great Brahma), without beginning or end,\nomniscient, and omnipresent; eternal, unchangeable, and supremely happy. He is\nSiva, Hir\xc4\x81nyagarbha, and\n\np. 120\n\n[paragraph continues] Surya; he is more excellent than all the gods, even than\nI myself., But it is impossible for me, or Brahm\xc4\x81, or the gods, to declare the\ngreatness of V\xc4\x81sudeva, the originator and lord of the universe."\n\nIn the "Var\xc4\x81ha Pur\xc4\x81na" * the special work of Vishnu as preserver is\ndescribed:--"The supreme god N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81yana having conceived the thought of creating\nthis universe, considered also that it was necessary that it should be\nprotected after it was created; \'but as it is impossible for an incorporeal\nbeing to exert action, let me produce from my own essence a corporeal being,\nby means of whom I may protect the world.\' Having thus reflected, the pre-\nexisting N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81yana created from his own substance an ungenerated and divine\nform, on whom he bestowed these blessings: \'Be thou the framer of all things,\nO Vishnu! Be thou always the protector of the three worlds, and the adored of\nall men. Be thou omniscient and almighty; and do thou at all times accomplish\nthe wishes of Brahm\xc4\x81, and the gods.\' The Supreme Spirit then resumed his\nessential nature. Vishnu, as he meditated on the purpose for which he had been\nproduced, sank into a mysterious slumber; and as in his sleep he imagined the\nproduction of various things, a lotus sprang from his navel. In the centre of\nthis lotus Brahm\xc4\x81 appeared; and Vishnu, beholding the production of his body,\nwas delighted." The phraseology of this passage gives countenance to what was\nsaid before, that in the worship of some of the Hindus, N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81yana is regarded\nas identical with Brahm\xc4\x81 the Supreme.\n\nIn pictures Vishnu is represented as a black man with four arms: in one hand\nhe holds a club; in another a shell; in a third a chakra, or discus, with\n\np. 121\n\nwhich he slew his enemies; and in the fourth a lotus. He rides upon the bird\nGaruda, and is dressed in yellow robes.\n\nThe following description of Vaikuntha, the heaven of Vishnu, is from the\nMah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata. * It is made entirely of gold, and is 80,000 miles in\ncircumference. All its buildings are made of jewels. The pillars and ornaments\nof the buildings are of precious stones. The crystal waters of the Ganges fall\nfrom the higher heavens on the head of Druva; from thence into the hair of the\nseven Rishis; and from thence they fall and form a river. Here are also five\npools containing blue, red, and white lotuses. On a seat glorious as the\nmeridian sun, sitting on white lotuses, is Vishnu; and on his right hand\nLakshmi, who shines like a continued blaze of lightning, and from whose body\nthe fragrance of the lotus extends 800 miles.\n\nThis deity is worshipped not only under the name and in the form of Vishnu,\nbut also in one of his many incarnations. Whenever any great calamity occurred\nin the world, or the wickedness of any of its inhabitants proved an unbearable\nnuisance to the gods, Vishnu, as Preserver, had to lay aside his invisibility,\ncome to earth in some form, generally human, and, when his work was done, he\nreturned again to the skies. There is no certainty as to the number of times\nhe has become incarnate. Some Pur\xc4\x81nas describe ten Avat\xc4\x81ras, as they are\ncalled; some mention twenty-four; and sometimes declare that they are\ninnumerable. Ten is the commonly received number, and these are the most\nimportant ones. They will be considered in due order. Of these ten, nine have\nalready been accomplished; one, the Kalki, is still future. "Some of these\nAvat\xc4\x81ras are of an entirely cosmical\n\np. 122\n\ncharacter; others, however, are probably based on historical events, the\nleading personage of which was gradually endowed with divine attributes, until\nhe was regarded as the incarnation of the deity himself." In the "Matsya\nPur\xc4\x81na" * is the following legend, which gives a reason for the manifold and\nvaried appearances of this deity:--\n\n"The asuras (demons, lit. non-suras) having been repeatedly defeated by the\nsuras (gods), and deprived of all share of the sacrifices, were meditating to\nwithdraw from the unavailing contest, when Sukra, their preceptor, determined\nto propitiate Siva by a severe tapas (penance), and procure from him a charm\nby means of which they could conquer. Having left them for this purpose, the\nasuras said amongst themselves, \'As our preceptor has laid aside his arms and\nassumed the ascetic dress, how shall we be able to gain a victory over the\nsuras? Let us seek refuge with the mother of Kavya (Sukra), and endure this\ndistress till he shall return; and then let us fight!\' Having thus resolved,\nthey hastened to Kavya\'s mother, who, protecting them, said, \'Fear not! remain\nnear me, and no danger shall approach you!\'\n\n"The suras, seeing the asuras thus protected, were about to attack them, when\nthe goddess in anger thus addressed Indra: \'If thou desist not, I will deprive\nyou of the sovereignty of heaven.\' Alarmed at her angry words, and dreading\nher magic power, Indra was yielding to her desire, when Vishnu appeared and\nsaid to him, Yield not, for I will assist you!\' The goddess observing that\nIndra was protected by Vishnu, angrily said, \'Now let the contending foes\nbehold how the power of my devotions shall subdue both Indra and\n\np. 123\n\n[paragraph continues] Vishnu.\' Finding themselves likely to be overcome, they\nasked each other, \'How shall we liberate ourselves from this difficulty?\'\nIndra then said to Vishnu, \'Hasten to conquer before she has finished her\ninvocations, or we shall be defeated!\' Then Vishnu, considering the detriment\nthat must be incurred by the gods should the mother of Kavya bring her\nincantations to a successful issue, deemed that the slaying of a woman under\nsuch circumstances was allowable, seized his discus, and smote off her head.\nBhrigu, seeing this horrid deed of the slaughter of a woman and the death of\nhis wife, was violently incensed, and thus cursed Vishnu: \'Since thou hast\nknowingly murdered a woman, thou shalt be born seven times amongst men;\' he\nafterwards somewhat modified its force as he said, \'but each birth shall be\nfor the advantage of the world, and for the restoration of justice.\'"\n\nIt is interesting to know the character of the tapas (penance) by which Sukra\nhoped to gain power over the gods. He was to imbibe the smoke of a fire of\nchaff with his head downwards for a thousand years. He accomplished this\ndifficult feat, and by it so pleased Siva, that he gave him many boons,\nincluding that of superiority over the gods. But the asuras did not profit\nlong by this penance of their preceptor, as they were deceived by the\npreceptor of the gods, who, assuming Sukra\'s form, gave them bad advice, which\nthey followed to their hurt.\n\nIn the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na" * the benefits to be hoped for from the worship of\nVishnu are taught. The question is asked, "By what acts can men free\nthemselves from Yama?" The reply given is that which was once told by a holy\nMuni who recollected his former births,\n\np. 124\n\nand by whom "what was, and what will be, was accurately told." "Yama,\nbeholding one of his servants with a noose in his hands, whispered to him and\nsaid, \'Keep clear of the worshippers of Madhusudana (Vishnu). I am lord of all\nmen, the Vaishnavas (worshippers of Vishnu) excepted. I was appointed by\nBrahm\xc4\x81 to restrain mankind, and regulate the consequences of good and evil in\nthe universe. But he who worships Hari is independent of me. He who through\nholy knowledge diligently adores the lotus-foot of Hari is released from all\nthe bonds of sin, and you must avoid him as you would fire fed with oil.\' And\nagain: \'He who pleases Vishnu obtains all terrestrial enjoyments, heaven, and\na place in heaven; and, what is best of all, final liberation: whatever he\nwishes, and to whatever extent, whether much or little, he receives it when\nAchyuta (the undecaying one) is content with him.\'"\n\nThe means by which the favour of this god is to be obtained are then\nexplained:--"The supreme Vishnu is propitiated by a man who observes the\ninstitutions of caste, order, and purificatory practices; no other path is the\nway to please him. He who offers sacrifices, sacrifices to him; he who murmurs\nprayer, prays to him; he who injures living creatures, injures him: for Hari\nis all things. Kesava is most pleased with him who does good to others; who\nnever utters abuse, calumny, or untruth; who never covets another\'s wife or\nanother\'s wealth, and who bears ill-will towards none; who never beats nor\nslays any animate or inanimate thing; who is ever diligent in the service of\nthe gods, of the Br\xc4\x81hmans, and of his spiritual preceptor; who is ever\ndesirous of the welfare of all creatures, of his children, and of his own\nsoul; in whose pure heart no pleasure is derived from the imperfections of\nlove and\n\np. 125\n\nhatred. The man who conforms to the duties enjoined by scriptural authority\nfor every caste and condition of life is he who best worships Vishnu; there is\nno other mode."\n\nOf all the deities now reverenced in India, Vishnu in his many forms has\nperhaps the largest number of worshippers; and the account of his life and the\npraises presented to him occupy a very large portion of the later Hindu\nscriptures. This pre-eminence was certainly not recognized in the Vedic Age,\nas the following passage will show:--\n\n"In the Rig-Veda are the following verses:--\'May the gods preserve us from the\nplace from which Vishnu strode over the seven regions of the earth. Vishnu\nstrode over this [universe]; in three places he planted his step; [the world\nor his step] was enveloped in his dust. Vishnu, the unconquerable preserver,\nstrode three steps.\' * In these verses there is probably the germ of the Dwarf\nIncarnation, and also of the attribute of Preserver. The interpretations of\ntwo commentators of the three strides of Vishnu are as follows:--One regards\nhim \'as a god, who, in what are called his three strides, is manifested in a\nthreefold form as Agni on earth, as Indra or V\xc4\x81yu in the atmosphere, and as\nthe Sun in heaven;\' \xe2\x80\xa0 the other interprets Vishnu\'s three strides as \'the\nrising, culmination, and setting of the sun.\'" \xe2\x80\xa1\n\nVishnu, in the Rig-Veda, is said "to have established the heavens and the\nearth; to contain all the world in his strides; to have, with Indra, made the\natmosphere wide, stretched out the worlds, produced the Sun, the Dawn, and\nFire; to have received the homage of Varuna; whilst his greatness is described\nas having no limit within\n\np. 126\n\nthe ken of present or future beings. The attributes ascribed to Vishnu in some\nof these passages are such that, if the latter stood alone in the Rig-Veda,\nthey might lead us to suppose that he was regarded by the Vedic Rishis as the\nchief of all the gods. But Indra is associated with Vishnu even in some of\nthose texts in which the latter is most highly magnified: nay, in one place,\nthe power by which Vishnu takes his three strides is described as being\nderived from Indra; in another text, Vishnu is represented as celebrating\nIndra\'s praise; whilst in another verse, Vishnu is said to have been generated\nby Soma. It is also a fact that the hymns and verses which are dedicated to\nthe praises of Indra, Agni, etc., are extremely numerous, whilst the entire\nhymns and separate verses in which Vishnu is celebrated are much fewer . . .\nVishnu is introduced as the subject of laudation among a crowd of other\ndivinities, from which he is there in no way distinguished as being in any\nrespect superior. From this fact we may conclude that he was regarded by those\nwriters as on a footing of equality with the other deities. Further, the Rig-\nVeda contains numerous texts in which the Rishis ascribe to Indra, Varuna, and\nother gods, the same high and awful attributes and functions which are spoken\nof in other hymns as belonging to Vishnu. . . . If then we look to the large\nnumber of texts in which some of the other gods are celebrated, and to the\ncomparatively small number of those in which Vishnu is exclusively or\nprominently magnified, we shall come to the conclusion that the latter deity\noccupied a somewhat subordinate place in the estimation and affections of the\nancient Rishis." *\n\nAmongst the thousand names of Vishnu, the following,\n\np. 127\n\nin addition to those already given, are most commonly known:--\n\nMadhusudana, the destroyer of Madhu; and Kaitabhajit, the conqueror of\nKaitabha. These were two demons who issued from Vishnu\'s ear as he lay asleep\non the serpent Sesha at the end of a Kalpa, * and were about to destroy\nBrahm\xc4\x81, as he sat on the lotus which sprang from Vishnu\'s navel, when this\ndeity slew them, and hence obtained these names\n\nVaikunthan\xc4\x81th, "The Lord of Paradise."\n\nKesava, "He who has excellent hair."\n\nMadhava, "Made of honey; or a descendant of Madhu."\n\nSwayambhu, "The self-existent one."\n\nPitamvara, "He who wears yellow garments."\n\nJan\xc4\x81rddana, "He who causes the people to worship."\n\nVishvamvara, "The protector of the world."\n\nHari, "The saviour; " lit. he who takes possession of.\n\nAnanta, "The endless."\n\nD\xc4\x81modara, "Bound with a rope."\n\nMukunda, "The deliverer."\n\nPurusha, "The man," or "The spirit."\n\nPurushottama, "The supreme man or spirit."\n\nYajneswara, "The lord of sacrifice."\n\n##### LAKSHMI.\n\nLakshmi, or very commonly Sri, is the wife of Vishnu, and under various names\nappears in this relation in his various incarnations. "As the lord of the\nworlds, the god of gods, Jan\xc4\x81rddana descends amongst mankind in various\nshapes; so does his coadjutor Sri. Thus, when Hari was born a dwarf, the son\nof Aditi, Lakshmi\n\np. 128\n\nappeared from the lotus as Padm\xc4\x81, or Kamal\xc4\x81; when he was born as R\xc4\x81ma\n(Parasur\xc4\x81ma) of the race of Bhrigu, she was Dhar\xc4\x81ni; when he was R\xc4\x81ghava\n(Ramachandra), she was Sita; and when he was Krishna, she was Rukmini. In the\nother descents of Vishnu she was his associate. If he takes a celestial form,\nshe appears as divine; if a mortal, she becomes a mortal too, transforming her\nown person agreeably to whatever character it pleases Vishnu to assume." *\n\nThere are two somewhat contradictory accounts of her origin; the "Vishnu\nPur\xc4\x81na" explains this. \xe2\x80\xa0 "The divinities Dh\xc4\x81ta and Vidh\xc4\x81t\xc4\x81 were born to Bhrigu\nby Khy\xc4\x81ti, as was a daughter Sri, the wife of N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81yana, the god of gods." The\nquestion is asked, "It is commonly said that Sri was born from the sea of\nmilk, when it was churned for ambrosia; how then can you say that she was the\ndaughter of Bhrigu and Khy\xc4\x81ti?" In answer to this question, a most elaborate\naccount of her virtues is given: "Sri, the bride of Vishnu, the mother of the\nworld, is eternal, imperishable; as he is all-pervading, so she is\nomnipresent. Vishnu is meaning, she is speech; Hari is polity, she is\nprudence; Vishnu is understanding, she is intellect; he is righteousness, she\nis devotion; Sri is the earth, Hari is its support. In a word, of gods,\nanimals, and men, Hari is all that is called male; Lakshmi is all that is\ntermed female; there is nothing else than they." Later on \xe2\x80\xa1 we read, "Her\nfirst birth was as the daughter of Bhrigu and Khy\xc4\x81ti; it was at a subsequent\nperiod that she was produced from the sea, at the churning of the ocean by the\ndemons and the gods."\n\nThe account of the churning of the ocean, to which\n\np. 129\n\nfrequent reference is made in the Hindu scriptures, is found in the R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana,\nand several of the Pur\xc4\x81nas; though there are some discrepancies, they agree in\nthe main. The reason for this great act is as follows:-- * A saint named\nDurv\xc4\x81ras, a portion of Siva, was travelling, when he met a celestial nymph\nwith a sweet-smelling\n\n[![LAKSHMI.](tn/12900.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/12900.jpg)  \nLAKSHMI.  \n\ngarland, which at his request she gave to him. Excited with the scent, he was\ndancing, when he met Indra, seated on his elephant. To please the mighty god,\nthe saint presented him with the garland, who placed it upon his elephant\'s\nbead. The elephant in his turn\n\np. 130\n\nbecoming excited, seized the garland with his trunk and threw it upon the\nground. Durv\xc4\x81ras, seeing his gift slighted, cursed the god in his anger, and\ntold him that his kingdom should be overwhelmed with ruin. From that time\nIndra\'s power began to wane; for though he sought forgiveness, the Br\xc4\x81hman\'s\nanger was not to be appeased. As the effects of the curse were experienced by\nthe gods, they, fearing they should be overcome by the asuras, fled to Brahm\xc4\x81\nfor help. He told them he could not assist them; that Vishnu alone could do\nthis, whom he advised them to seek. Brahm\xc4\x81 conducted them to Vishnu; and,\nhaving sufficiently lauded him, caused him to lend a willing ear to their\nrequest. In the following lines, * put into verse, from the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na,"\nwe have their prayer, Vishnu\'s advice and its result:--\n\n"The gods addressed the mighty Vishnu thus:  \n Conquered in battle by the evil demons,  \n We fly to thee for succour; soul of all,  \n Pity and by thy might deliver us!\'  \n Hari, the lord, creator of the world,  \n Thus by the gods implored, all graciously  \n Replied, \'Your strength shall be restored, ye gods--  \n Only accomplish what I now command:  \n Unite yourselves in peaceful combination  \n With these your foes; collect all plants and herbs  \n Of diverse kinds from every quarter; cast them  \n Into the sea of milk; take Mandara,  \n The mountain, for a churning stick, and V\xc4\x81suki,  \n The serpent, for a rope; together churn  \n The ocean to produce the beverage--  \n Source of all strength and immortality--  \n Then reckon on mine aid: I will take care  \n Your foes shall share your toil, but not partake  \n In its reward, or drink th\' immortal draught.\'\n\np. 131\n\n[paragraph continues]  Thus by the god of gods advised, the host  \n United in alliance with the demons.  \n Straightway they gathered various herbs, and cast them  \n Into the waters; then they took the mountain  \n To serve as churning-staff; and next the snake  \n To serve as cord, and in the ocean\'s midst  \n Hari himself, present in tortoise form,  \n Became a pivot for the churning-staff.  \n Then did they churn the sea of milk; and first  \n Out of the waters rose the sacred cow--  \n God-worshipped Surabhi--eternal fountain  \n Of milk and offerings of butter; next,  \n While holy Siddhas wondered at the sight,  \n With eyes all rolling, V\xc4\x81runi uprose--  \n Goddess of Wine. Then from the whirlpool sprang  \n Fair P\xc4\x81rij\xc4\x81ta, tree of Paradise, delight  \n Of heavenly maidens, with its fragrant blossoms  \n Perfuming the whole world. Th\' Apsarasas,  \n Troop of celestial nymphs, matchless in grace,  \n Perfect in loveliness, were next produced.  \n Then from the sea uprose the cool-rayed moon,  \n Which Mah\xc4\x81deva seized; terrific poison  \n Next issued from the waters--this the snake-gods  \n Claimed as their own. Then, seated on a lotus,  \n Beauty\'s bright goddess, peerless Sri, arose  \n Out of the waves; and with her, robed in white,  \n Came forth Dhanvantari, the gods\' physician.  \n High in his hand he bore the cup of nectar--  \n Life-giving draught--longed for by gods and demons."\n\nOn Sri\'s appearance the sages were enraptured, the heavenly choristers sang\nher praises, and the celestial nymphs danced before her. Gang\xc4\x81 and the other\nsacred streams followed her, and the heavenly elephants took up their pure\nwaters in golden vessels and poured them upon her. The sea of milk presented\nher with a wreath of unfading flowers; and the artist of the gods decorated\nher with lovely ornaments. Thus bathed, attired, and adorned, the goddess, in\nthe presence of the gods, cast herself upon the breast of Hari, and, reclining\nthere,\n\np. 132\n\ngazed upon the gods, who were enraptured with her. Siva was most violent and\nwished to possess himself of her. From the demons she turned away; hence they\nwere miserable. Seeing the cup of nectar, they tried to seize it, when Vishnu,\nassuming the appearance of a beautiful woman, attracted their attention,\nwhilst the gods quaffed the divine cup. The result was that in the conflict\nwhich followed the gods were successful.\n\nThe following account of Sri is from the R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana:--\n\n      "When many a year had fled,  \n Up floated, on her lotus bed,  \n A maiden fair, and tender-eyed,  \n In the young flush of beauty\'s pride.  \n She shone with pearl and golden sheen,  \n And seals of glory stamped her queen.  \n On each round arm glowed many a gem,  \n On her smooth brows a diadem.  \n Rolling in waves beneath her crown,  \n The glory of her hair rolled down.  \n Pearls on her neck of price untold,  \n The lady shone like burnished gold.  \n Queen of the gods, she leapt to land,  \n A lotus in her perfect hand,  \n And fondly, of the lotus sprung,  \n To lotus-bearing Vishnu clung.  \n Her, gods above and men below  \n As Beauty\'s Queen and Fortune know." *\n\nAs noticed in this last extract, Lakshmi, or Sri, is regarded as the goddess\nof Love, Beauty, and Prosperity. When a man is growing rich, it is said that\nLakshmi has come to dwell with him; whilst those in adversity are spoken of as\n"forsaken of Lakshmi." In pictures she is painted as a lady of a bright golden\ncolour, seated on a lotus, with two arms.\n\n"The name of Lakshmi as that of a goddess does not\n\np. 133\n\noccur in the Rig-Veda, though the word itself is found in its signification as\nprosperity." *\n\nLakshmi is known also by the following names:--\n\nHaripriy\xc4\x81, "The beloved of Hari."\n\nPadma, "The Lotus," and Padm\xc4\x81laya, "She who dwells on a lotus."\n\nJaladhij\xc4\x81, "The ocean-born."\n\nChanchal\xc4\x81, "The fickle one."\n\nLokam\xc4\x81ta, "The mother of the world."\n\n![](img/13300.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[117:*](hmvp18.htm#fr_121) "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na," p. 607.\n\n[118:*](hmvp18.htm#fr_122) "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na," p. 3, note.\n\n[118:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp18.htm#fr_123) Kennedy, "Hindu Mythology," p. 240.\n\n[119:*](hmvp18.htm#fr_124) Kennedy, "Hindu Mythology," p. 246.\n\n[120:*](hmvp18.htm#fr_125) Kennedy, "Hindu Mythology," p. 246.\n\n[121:*](hmvp18.htm#fr_126) Ward. ii. 14.\n\n[122:*](hmvp18.htm#fr_127) Kennedy, "Hindu Mythology," p. 244.\n\n[123:*](hmvp18.htm#fr_128) Pp. 287-290.\n\n[125:*](hmvp18.htm#fr_129) Muir, O.
