From connexion.\n\nThe fact is that Brahman intelligent, consisting of bliss, &c., connects\nitself also with the passage 'Non-being was this in the beginning' (Taitt. Up.\nII, 7). For the section of the text which precedes that passage (viz.\n'Different from this Self consisting of understanding is the Self consisting\nof Bliss;--he wished, may I be many;--he created all whatever there is. Having\ncreated he entered into it; having entered it he became sat and tyat') clearly\nrefers to Brahman consisting of Bliss, which realises its purposes, creates\nall beings, and entering into them is the Self of all. When, therefore, after\nthis we meet with the. _s_ loka ('Non-being this was in the beginning')\nintroduced by the words 'On this there is also this _s_ loka'--which shows\nthat the _s_ loka is meant to throw light on what precedes; and when further\nor we have the passage 'From fear of it the wind blows' &c., which, referring\nto the same Brahman, predicates of it universal rulership, bliss of nature,\nand so on; we conclude with certainty that the _s_ loka about 'Non-being' also\nrefers to Brahman. As during a pralaya the distinction of names and forms does\nnot exist, and Brahman also then does not exist in so far as connected with\nnames and forms, the text applies to Brahman the term 'Non-being.' The text\n'Non-being only this was in the beginning' explains itself in the same way.--\nNor can we admit\n\np. 377\n\nthe contention that the text 'Now all this was then undeveloped 'refers to the\nPradhana as the cause of the world; for the Undeveloped there spoken of is\nnothing else but Brahman in so far as its body is not yet evolved. For the\ntext continues 'That same being entered thither to the very tips of the\nfinger-nails;' 'When seeing, eye by name; when hearing, ear by name; when\nthinking, mind by name;' 'Let men meditate upon him as Self;' where the\nintroductory words 'that same being' refer back to the Undeveloped--which thus\nis said to enter into all things and thereby to become their ruler. And it is\nknown from another text also( _Kh_. Up. VI, 3, 2) that it is the all-creative\nhighest Brahman which enters into its creation and evolves names and forms.\nThe text 'Having entered within, the ruler of creatures, the Self of all'\nmoreover shows that the creative principle enters into its creatures for the\npurpose of ruling them, and such entering again cannot be attributed to the\nnon-sentient Pradhana. The Undeveloped therefore is Brahman in that state\nwhere its body is not yet developed; and when the text continues 'it developed\nitself by names and forms' the meaning is that Brahman developed itself in so\nfar as names and forms were distinguished in the world that constitutes\nBrahman's body. On this explanation of the texts relating to creation we\nfurther are enabled to take the thought, purpose, &c,, attributed to the\ncreative principle, in their primary literal sense. And, we finally remark,\nneither the term 'Brahman' nor the term 'Self in any way suits the Pradhana,\nwhich is neither absolutely great nor pervading in the sense of entering into\nthings created with a view to ruling them. It thus remains a settled\nconclusion that Brahman is the sole cause of the world.--Here terminates the\nadhikara _n_ a of '(Brahman's) causality.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 16.
