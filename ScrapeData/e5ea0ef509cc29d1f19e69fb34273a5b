You maintain that consciousness which is in\nreality devoid alike of objects and substrate presents itself, owing to error,\nin the form of a knowing subject, just as mother o' pearl appears as silver;\n(consciousness itself being viewed as a real substrate of an erroneous\nimputation), because an erroneous imputation cannot take place apart from a\nsubstrate. But this theory is indefensible. If things were as you desciibe\nthem, the conscious 'I' would be cognised as co-ordinate with the state of\nconsciousness 'I am consciousness,' just as the shining thing presenting\nitself to our eyes is judged to be silver. But the fact is that the state of\nconsciousness presents itself as something apart, constituting a\ndistinguishing\n\np. 62\n\nattribute of the I, just as the stick is an attribute of Devadatta who carries\nit. The judgment 'I am conscious' reveals an 'I' distinguished by\nconsciousness; and to declare that it refers only to a state of consciousness\n--which is a mere attribute--is no better than to say that the judgment\n'Devadatta carries a stick' is about the stick only. Nor are you right in\nsaying that the idea of the Self being a knowing agent, presents itself to the\nmind of him only who erroneously identifies the Self and the body, an error\nexpressing itself in judgments such as 'I am stout,' and is on that account\nfalse; for from this it would follow that the consciousness which is\nerroneously imagined as a Self is also false; for it presents itself to the\nmind of the same person. You will perhaps rejoin that consciousness is not\nfalse because it (alone) is not sublatcd by that cognition which sublates\neverything else. Well, we reply, then the knowership of the Self also is not\nfalse; for that also is not sublatcd. You further maintain that the character\nof being a knower, i.e. the agent in the action of knowing, does not become\nthe non-changing Self; that being a knower is something implying change, of a\nnon-intelligent kind ( _g_ ada), and residing in the aha _m_ kara which is the\nabode of change and a mere effect of the Unevolved (the Prak _ri_ ti); that\nbeing an agent and so on is like colour and other qualities, an attribute of\nwhat is objective; and that if we admit the Self to be an agent and the object\nof the notion of the 'I,' it also follows that the Self is, like the body, not\na real Self but something external and non-intelligent. But all this is\nunfounded, since the internal organ is, like the body, non-intelligent, an\neffect of Prak _ri_ ti, an object of knowledge, something outward and for the\nsake of others merely; while being a knowing subject constitutes the special\nessential nature of intelligent beings. To explain. Just as the body, through\nits objectiveness, outwardness, and similar causes, is distinguished from what\npossesses the opposite attributes of subjectiveness, inwardness, and so on;\nfor the same reason the aha _m_ kara also--which is of the same substantial\nnature as the body--is similarly distinguished. Hence the aha _m_ kara is no\nmore\n\np. 63\n\na knower than it is something subjective; otherwise there would be an evident\ncontradiction. As knowing cannot be attributed to the aha _m_ kara, which is\nan object of knowledge, so knowership also cannot be ascribed to it; for of\nthat also it is the object. Nor can it be maintained that to be a knower is\nsomething essentially changing. For to be a knower is to be the substrate of\nthe quality of knowledge, and as the knowing Self is eternal, knowledge which\nis an essential quality of the Self is also eternal. That the Self is eternal\nwill be declared in the Sutra, II, 3, 17; and in II, 3, 18 the term _'g \xc3\xb1a'_\n(knower) will show that it is an essential quality of the Self to be the abode\nof knowledge. That a Self whose essential nature is knowledge should be the\nsubstrate of the (quality of) knowledge--just as gems and the like are the\nsubstrate of light--gives rise to no contradiction whatever.\n\nKnowledge (the quality) which is in itself unlimited, is capable of\ncontraction and expansion, as we shall show later on. In the so-called kshetra\n_g \xc3\xb1_a--condition of the Self, knowledge is, owing to the influence of work\n(karman), of a contracted nature, as it more or less adapts itself to work of\ndifferent kinds, and is variously determined by the different senses. With\nreference to this various flow of knowledge as due to the senses, it is spoken\nof as rising and setting, and the Self possesses the quality of an agent. As\nthis quality is not, however, essential, but originated by action, the Self is\nessentially unchanging. This changeful quality of being a knower can belong\nonly to the Self whose essential nature is knowledge; not possibly to the non-\nintelligent aha _m_ kara. But, you will perhaps say, the aha _m_ kara,\nalthough of non-intelligent nature, may become a knower in so far as by\napproximation to intelligence it becomes a reflection of the latter. How, we\nask in return, is this becoming a reflection of intelligence imagined to take\nplace? Does consciousness become a reflection of the aha _m_ kara, or does the\naha _m_ kara become a reflection of consciousness? The former alternative is\ninadmissible, since you will not allow to consciousness the quality of being a\nknower; and so is the latter since, as explained\n\np. 64\n\nabove, the non-intelligent aha _m_ kara can never become a knower. Moreover,\nneither consciousness nor the aha _m_ kara are objects of visual perception.\nOnly things seen by the eye have reflections.--Let it then be said that as an\niron ball is heated by contact with fire, so the consciousness of being a\nknower is imparted to the aha _m_ kara through its contact with Intelligence.\n--This view too is inadmissible; for as you do not allow real knowership to\nIntelligence, knowership or the consciousness of knowership cannot be imparted\nto the aha _m_ kara by contact with Intelligence; and much less even can\nknowership or the consciousness of it be imparted to Intelligence by contact\nwith the essentially non-intelligent aha _m_ kara. Nor can we accept what you\nsay about 'manifestation.' Neither the aha _m_ kara, you say, nor Intelligence\nis really a knowing subject, but the aha _m_ kara manifests consciousness\nabiding within itself (within the aha _m_ kara), as the mirror manifests the\nimage abiding within it. But the essentially non-intelligent aha _m_ kara\nevidently cannot 'manifest' the self-luminous Self. As has been said 'That the\nnon-intelligent aha _m_ kara should manifest the self-luminous Self, has no\nmore sense than to say that a spent coal manifests the Sun.' The truth is that\nall things depend for their proof on self-luminous consciousness; and now you\nmaintain that one of these things, viz. the non-intelligent aha _m_ kara--\nwhich itself depends for its light on consciousness--manifests consciousness,\nwhose essential light never rises or sets, and which is the cause that proves\neverything! Whoever knows the nature of the Self will justly deride such a\nview! The relation of 'manifestation' cannot hold good between consciousness\nand the aha _m_ kara for the further reason also that there is a contradiction\nin nature between the two, and because it would imply consciousness not to be\nconsciousness. As has been said, 'One cannot manifest the other, owing to\ncontradictoriness; and if the Self were something to be manifested, that would\nimply its being non-intelligent like a jar.' Nor is the matter improved by\nyour introducing the hand and the sunbeams (above, [p.\n38](sbe48007.htm#page_38)), and to say that as the sunbeams while manifesting\nthe hand, are at the\n\np. 65\n\nsame time manifested by the hand, so consciousness, while manifesting the aha\n_m_ kara, is at the same time itself manifested by the latter. The sunbeams\nare in reality not manifested by the hand at all. What takes place is that the\nmotion of the sunbeams is reversed (reflected) by the opposed hand; they thus\nbecome more numerous, and hence are perceived more clearly; but this is due\naltogether to the multitude of beams, not to any manifesting power on the part\nof the hand.\n\nWhat could, moreover, be the nature of that 'manifestation' of the Self\nconsisting of Intelligence, which would be effected through the aha _m_ kara?\nIt cannot be origination; for you acknowledge that what is self-established\ncannot be originated by anything else. Nor can it be 'illumination' (making to\nshine forth), since consciousness cannot--according to you--be the object of\nanother consciousness. For the same reason it cannot be any action assisting\nthe means of being conscious of consciousness. For such helpful action could\nbe of two kinds only. It would either be such as to cause the connexion of the\nobject to be known with the sense-organs; as e.g. any action which, in the\ncase of the apprehension of a species or of one's own face, causes connexion\nbetween the organ of sight and an individual of the species, or a looking-\nglass. Or it would be such as to remove some obstructive impurity in the mind\nof the knowing person; of this kind is the action of calmness and self-\nrestraint with reference to scripture which is the means of apprehending the\nhighest reality. Moreover, even if it were admitted that consciousness may be\nan object of consciousness, it could not be maintained that the 'I' assists\nthe means whereby that consciousness is effected. For if it did so, it could\nonly be in the way of removing any obstacles impeding the origination of such\nconsciousness; analogous to the way in which a lamp assists the eye by\ndispelling the darkness which impedes the origination of the apprehension of\ncolour. But in the case under discussion we are unable to imagine such\nobstacles. There is nothing pertaining to consciousness which obstructs the\norigination of the knowledge of consciousness\n\np. 66\n\nand which could be removed by the aha _m_ kara.--There is something, you will\nperhaps reply, viz. Nescience! Not so, we reply. That Nescience is removed by\nthe aha _m_ kara cannot be admitted; knowledge alone can put an end to\nNescience. Nor can consciousness be the abode of Nescience, because in that\ncase Nescience would have the same abode and the same object as knowledge.\n\nIn pure knowledge where there is no knowing subject and no object of knowledge\n--the so-called 'witnessing' principle (sakshin)--Nescience cannot exist. Jars\nand similar things cannot be the abode of Nescience because there is no\npossibility of their being the abode of knowledge, and for the same reason\npure knowledge also cannot be the abode of Nescience. And even if\nconsciousness were admitted to be the abode of Nescience, it could not be the\nobject of knowledge; for consciousness being viewed as the Self cannot be the\nobject of knowledge, and hence knowledge cannot terminate the Nescience\nabiding within consciousness. For knowledge puts an end to Nescience only with\nregard to its own objects, as in the case of the snake-rope. And the\nconsequence of this would be that the Nescience attached to consciousness\ncould never be destroyed by any one.--If Nescience, we further remark, is\nviewed as that which can be defined neither as Being nor non-Being, we shall\nshow later on that such Nescience is something quite incomprehensible.--On the\nother hand, Nescience, if understood to be the antecedent non-existence of\nknowledge, is not opposed in nature to the origination of knowledge, and hence\nthe dispelling of Nescience cannot be viewed as promoting the means of the\nknowledge of the Self.--From all this it follows that the aha _m_ kara cannot\neffect in any way 'manifestation of consciousness.'\n\nNor (to finish up this point) can it be said that it is the essential nature\nof manifesting agents to manifest things in so far as the latter have their\nabode in the former; for such a relation is not observed in the case of lamps\nand the like (which manifest what lies outside them). The essential\n\np. 67\n\nnature of manifesting agents rather lies therein that they promote the\nknowledge of things as they really are, and this is also the nature of\nwhatever promotes knowledge and the means thereof. Nor is it even true that\nthe mirror manifests the face. The mirror is only the cause of a certain\nirregularity, viz. the reversion of the ocular rays of light, and to this\nirregularity there is due the appearance of the face within the mirror; but\nthe manifesting agent is the light only. And it is evident that the aha _m_\nkara is not capable of producing an irregularity (analogous to that produced\nby the mirror) in consciousness which is self-luminous.--And--with regard to\nthe second analogous instance alleged by you--the fact is that the species is\nknown through the individual because the latter is its substrate (as expressed\nin the general principle, 'the species is the form of the individual'), but\nnot because the individual 'manifests' the species. Thus there is no reason,\neither real or springing from some imperfection, why the consciousness of\nconsciousness should be brought about by its abiding in the aha _m_ kara, and\nthe attribute of being the knowing agent or the consciousness of that cannot\ntherefore belong to the aha _m_ kara. Hence, what constitutes the inward Self\nis not pure consciousness but the 'I' which proves itself as the knowing\nsubject. In the absence of egoity, 'inwardness' could not be established for\nconsciousness.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The conscious subject persists in deep sleep](sbe48023.htm)\n\n"
