The Valakhilyas, whose passions were subdued, approached him full of\namazement and said: \'O Saint, we bow before thee; teach thou, for thou art the\nway, and there is no other for us. What process is there for the elemental\nSelf, by which, after leaving this (identity with the elemental body), he\nobtains union 4 with the (true) Self?\' Pra _g_ apati Kratu said to them:\n\n2\\. \'It has been said elsewhere: Like the waves in large rivers, that which\nhas been done before, cannot be turned back, and, like the tide of the sea,\nthe approach of death is hard to stem. Bound 5 by the fetters of the fruits of\ngood and evil, like a cripple; without freedom, like a man in prison; beset by\nmany fears, like one standing before Yama (the judge of\n\np. 300\n\nthe dead); intoxicated by the wine of illusion, like one intoxicated by wine;\nrushing about, like one possessed by an evil spirit; bitten by the world, like\none bitten by a great serpent; darkened by passion, like the night; illusory,\nlike magic; false, like a dream; pithless, like the inside of the Kadali;\nchanging its dress in a moment, like an actor 1; fair in appearance, like a\npainted wall, thus they call him; and therefore it is said:\n\nSound 2, touch, and other things are like nothings; if the elemental Self is\nattached to them, it will not remember the Highest Place 3.\n\n3\\. This is indeed the remedy for the elemental Self: Acquirement of the\nknowledge of the Veda, performance of one\'s own duty, therefore conformity on\nthe part of each man to the order to which he happens to belong. This 4 is\nindeed the rule for one\'s own duty, other performances are like the mere\nbranches of a stem 5. Through it one obtains the Highest above, otherwise one\nfalls downward 6. Thus is one\'s own duty declared, which is to be found in the\nVedas. No one belongs truly to an order (a _s_ rama) who transgresses his own\nlaw 7. And if people say, that a man does not belong to any of the orders, and\nthat he is an ascetic 8, this is wrong, though, on\n\np. 301\n\nthe other hand, no one who is not an ascetic brings his sacrificial works to\nperfection or obtains knowledge of the Highest Self 1. For thus it is said:\n\nBy ascetic penance goodness is obtained, from goodness understanding is\nreached, from understanding the Self is obtained, and he who has obtained\nthat, does not return 2.\n\n4\\. "Brahman is," thus said one who knew the science of Brahman; and this\npenance is the door to Brahman, thus said one who by penance had cast off all\nsin. The syllable Om is the manifest greatness of Brahman, thus said one who\nwell grounded (in Brahman) always meditates on it. Therefore by knowledge, by\npenance, and by meditation is Brahman gained. Thus one goes beyond 3 Brahman\n(Hira _n_ yagarbha), and to a divinity higher than the gods; nay, he who knows\nthis, and worships Brahman by these three (by knowledge, penance, and\nmeditation), obtains bliss imperishable, infinite, and unchangeable. Then\nfreed from those things (the senses of the body, &c.) by which he was filled\nand overcome, a mere charioteer 4, he obtains union with the Self.\'\n\np. 302\n\n5\\. The Valakhilyas said: \'O Saint, thou art the teacher, thou art the teacher\n1. What thou hast said, has been properly laid up in our mind. Now answer us a\nfurther question: Agni, Vayu, \xc3\x82ditya, Time (kala) which is Breath (pra _n_ a\n2), Food (anna), Brahma 3, Rudra, Vish _n_ u, thus do some meditate on one,\nsome on another. Say which of these is the best for us.\' He said to them:\n\n6\\. \'These are but the chief manifestations of the highest, the immortal, the\nincorporeal Brahman. He who is devoted to one, rejoices here in his world\n(presence), thus he said. Brahman indeed is all this, and a man may meditate\non, worship, or discard also those which 4 are its chief manifestations. With\nthese (deities) he proceeds to higher and higher worlds, and when all things\nperish, he becomes one with the Purusha, yes, with the Purusha.\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[299:1](sbe15114.htm#fr_1005) M. reads vyavartatvam.\n\n[299:2](sbe15114.htm#fr_1006) It should be ka _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ alatvam.\n\n[299:3](sbe15114.htm#fr_1007) M. reads mattasvaro.\n\n[299:4](sbe15115.htm#fr_1008) Instead of the irregular sayo _g_ yam, M. always\nreads sayu _g_ yam.\n\n[299:5](sbe15115.htm#fr_1009) It is not quite clear what is the subject to\nwhich all these adjectives refer. M. reads baddho for baddham, but afterwards\nagrees with the text as published by Cowell.\n\n[300:1](sbe15115.htm#fr_1010) M. reads na _t_ avat.\n\n[300:2](sbe15115.htm#fr_1011) M. reads ye \'rtha anartha iva te sthita _h_ ,\nesham.\n\n[300:3](sbe15115.htm#fr_1012) M. reads na smaret paramam padam.\n\n[300:4](sbe15115.htm#fr_1013) M. reads svadharma eva sarva _m_ dhatte, stambha\n_s_ akhevetarani.\n\n[300:5](sbe15115.htm#fr_1014) The commentator considers the other sacrificial\nperformances as hurtful, and to be avoided.\n\n[300:6](sbe15115.htm#fr_1015) M. reads anyathadha _h_ pataty, esha.\n\n[300:7](sbe15115.htm#fr_1016) The rules of the order to which he belongs.\n\n[300:8](sbe15115.htm#fr_1017) A Tapasvin is free from the restrictions of the\npreceding asramas, p. 301 but he must have obeyed them first, before he can\nbecome a real Tapasvin.\n\n[301:1](sbe15115.htm#fr_1018) M. reads a _s_ rameshv evavasthitas tapasvi _k_\nety u _k_ yata ity, etad apy uktam, &c. This would mean, \'For it is said that\nhe only who has dwelt in the a _s_ ramas is also called a Tapasvin, a real\nascetic; and this also has been said, that no one obtains self-knowledge\nexcept an ascetic.\' This is not impossible, but the commentator follows the\ntext as printed by Cowell. AI. reads atma _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anenadhigama _h_ , karma _s_\nuddhi.\n\n[301:2](sbe15115.htm#fr_1019) M. reads manasa prapyate tv atma hy atmaptya na\nnivartata iti.\n\n[301:3](sbe15115.htm#fr_1020) M. reads pura eta, which may be right.\n\n[301:4](sbe15115.htm#fr_1021) Rathita _h_ is a very strange word, but, like\neverything else, it is p. 302 explained by the commentator, viz. as ratham\nprapito rathitva _m_ _k_ a prapita iti yavat. Nevertheless the reading of M.\nseems to me preferable, viz. atha yai _h_ paripur _n_ o \'bhibhuto \'ya _m_\ntathaitai _s_ _k_ a, tai _h_ sarvair vimukta svatmany eva sayu _g_ yam upaiti.\nI should prefer vimuktas tv atmany eva, and translate, \'But then, freed from\nall those things by which he was filled and likewise was overcome by them, he\nobtains union with the Self.\'\n\n[302:1](sbe15115.htm#fr_1022) M. reads the second time abhivady asmiti, which\nis no improvement. It might have been ativadyasiti.\n\n[302:2](sbe15115.htm#fr_1023) M. reads Yama _h_ pra _n_ o.\n\n[302:3](sbe15115.htm#fr_1024) This is, of course, the personal Brahma of the\nHindu triad. To distinguish this personal Brahma from the impersonal, I\nsometimes give his name in the nom. masc., Brahma, and not the grammatical\nbase, Brahman.\n\n[302:4](sbe15115.htm#fr_1025) M. reads ya va asya. The commentator explains ya\nvasya _h_ by vasayogya _h_ ; or ya va ya _h_ by ka _s_ _k_ it, admitting a\nVedic irregularity which is not quite clear.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Fifth Prapathaka](sbe15116.htm)\n\n'
