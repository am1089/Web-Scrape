When the first enthusiasm for\nsuch works as _S_ akuntala and Gita-Govinda had somewhat subsided, and\nSanskrit scholars had recognised that a truly scholarlike study of Indian\nliterature must begin with the beginning, the exclusively historical interest\nprevailed to so large an extent that the hymns of the Veda, the Brahma _n_ as,\nand the Sutras absorbed all interest, while the Upanishads were put aside for\na time as of doubtful antiquity, and therefore of minor importance.\n\nMy real love for Sanskrit literature was first kindled by the Upanishads. It\nwas in the year 1844, when attending Schelling's lectures at Berlin, that my\nattention was drawn to those ancient theosophic treatises, and I still possess\nmy collations of the Sanskrit MSS. which had then just arrived at Berlin, the\nChambers collection, and my copies of commentaries, and commentaries on\ncommentaries, which I made at that time. Some of my translations which I left\nwith Schelling, I have never been able to recover, though to judge from others\nwhich I still possess, the loss of them is of small consequence. Soon after\nleaving Berlin, when continuing my Sanskrit studies at Paris under Burnouf, I\nput aside the Upanishads, convinced that for a true appreciation of them it\nwas necessary to study, first of all, the earlier periods of Vedic literature,\nas represented by the hymns and the Brahma _n_ as of the Vedas.\n\nIn returning, after more than thirty years, to these favourite studies, I find\nthat my interest in them, though it has changed in character, has by no means\ndiminished.\n\np. lxvi\n\nIt is true, no doubt, that the stratum of literature which contains the\nUpanishads is later than the Sa _m_ hitas, and later than the Brahma _n_ as,\nbut the first germs of Upanishad doctrines go back at least as far as the\nMantra period, which provisionally has been fixed between 1000 and 800 B.C.\nConceptions corresponding to the general teaching of the Upanishads occur in\ncertain hymns of the Rig-veda-sa _m_ hita, they must have existed therefore\nbefore that collection was finally closed. One hymn in the Sa _m_ hita of the\nRig-veda (I, 191) was designated by Katyayana, the author of the Sarvanukrama\n_n_ ika, as an Upanishad. Here, however, upanishad means rather a secret charm\nthan a philosophical doctrine. Verses of the hymns have often been\nincorporated in the Upanishads, and among the Oupnekhats translated into\nPersian by Dara Shukoh we actually find the Purusha-sukta, the 90th hymn of\nthe tenth book of the Rig-veda 1, forming the greater portion of the Bark'heh\nSoukt. In the Sa _m_ hita of the Ya _g_ ur-veda, however, in the Va _g_\nasaneyi _s_ akha, we meet with a real Upanishad, the famous \xc3\x8e _s_ a or \xc3\x8e _s_\navasya-upanishad, while the Sivasa _m_ kalpa, too, forms part of its thirty-\nfourth book 2. In the Brahma _n_ as several Upanishads occur, even in portions\nwhich are not classed as \xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas, as, for instance, the well-known Kena\nor Talavakara upanishad. The recognised place, however, for the ancient\nUpanishads is in the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas, or forest-books, which, as a rule, form an\nappendix to the Brahma _n_ as, but are sometimes included also under the\ngeneral name of Brahma _n_ a. Brahma _n_ a, in fact, meaning originally the\nsayings of Brahmans, whether in the general sense of priests, or in the more\nspecial of Brahman-priest, is a name applicable not only to the books,\nproperly so called, but to all old prose traditions, whether contained in the\nSa _m_ hitas, such as the Taittiriya-sa _m_ hita, the Brahma _n_ as, the \xc3\x82ra\n_n_ yakas, the Upanishads, and even, in certain cases, in the Sutras. We shall\nsee in the introduction to the Aitareya-ara _n_ yaka, that that \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka\nis in the beginning\n\np. lxvii\n\na Brahma _n_ a, a mere continuation of the Aitareya-brahma _n_ a, explaining\nthe Mahavrata ceremony, while its last book contains the Sutras or short\ntechnical rules explaining the same ceremony which in the first book had been\ntreated in the style peculiar to the Brahma _n_ as. In the same Aitareya-ara\n_n_ yaka, III, 2, 6, 6, a passage of the Upanishad is spoken of as a Brahma\n_n_ a, possibly as something like a Brahma _n_ a, while something very like an\nUpanishad occurs in the \xc3\x82pastamba-sutras, and might be quoted therefore as a\nSutra 1. At all events the Upanishads, like the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas, belong to what\nHindu theologians call Sruti, or revealed literature, in opposition to Sm _ri_\nti, or traditional literature, which is supposed to be founded on the former,\nand allowed to claim a secondary authority only; and the earliest of these\nphilosophical treatises will always, I believe, maintain a place in the\nliterature of the world, among the most astounding productions of the human\nmind in any age and in any country.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[lxvi:1](sbe01012.htm#fr_28) See Weber.
