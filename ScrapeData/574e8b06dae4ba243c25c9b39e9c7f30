When the year has expired 1, the Diksha (initiation) takes place.\nAfter the slaughtering of the victim sacred to Pra _g_ apati 2, the (ish _t_\ni) offerings 3 come to an end. Some, however, say, 'Let him offer (them) on\nthe fires of his Purohita (court-chaplain). But why should one who is\ninitiated make offering? There are twelve Diksha (days), twelve Upasad (days)\nand three Sutyas (Soma-days), that amounts to the thrice-ninefold (stoma); but\nthe thrice-ninefold, indeed, is a thunderbolt, and the horse is the nobility\n(kshatra), and the Ra _g_ anya is the nobility; and political power (kshatra)\nis won by the thunderbolt: thus he wins 4 political power by means of the\nthunderbolt.\n\n13:4:4:22\\. When the Initiation-offering has been completed, and Speech\nreleased in the evening, masters\n\np. 372\n\nof lute-players have come thither: these the Adhvaryu calls upon, 'Masters of\nlute-players,' he says, 'sing ye of this Sacrificer along with the gods!' and\nthey accordingly sing of him in that manner--\n\n13:4:4:33\\. Day by day, after speech has been released, when, on the\ncompletion of the Agnishomiya (animal sacrifices), the Vasativari (water) has\nbeen carried round 1 (the sacrificial ground). The reason why they thus sing\nof him along with the gods is that they thereby make him share the same world\nwith the gods.\n\n13:4:4:44\\. On the Sutya-days (they sing of him) along with Pra _g_ apati in\nthe same way day by day, after the Vasativari (water) has been carried round\n2, and the Udavasaniya (offering) has been finally completed. The reason why\nthey thus sing of him\n\np. 373\n\nalong with Pra _g_ apati is that they thereby finally make him share the same\nworld with Pra _g_ apati.\n\n13:4:4:55\\. There are twenty-one sacrificial stakes, all of them twenty-one\ncubits long. The central one 1 is of ra _g_ _g_ udala 2 wood; on both sides\nthereof stand two 3 pitudaru (deodar) ones, six of bilva wood (Aegle\nMarmelos)--three on this side, and three on that,--six of khadira (Acacia\nCatechu) wood--three on this side, and three on that,--six of pala _s_ a\n(Butea frondosa) wood--three on this side, and three on that.\n\n13:4:4:66\\. Then as to why these stakes are suchlike. When Pra _g_ apati's\nvital airs had gone out of him, his body began to swell; and what phlegm there\nwas in it that flowed together and burst forth from inside through the nose,\nand it became this tree, the ra _g_ _g_ udala, whence it is viscid, for it\noriginated from phlegm: with that form (quality) he thus endows it (the\nstake). And as to why it is the (stake) standing by the fire, it is because\nthat one is the centre of the stakes, and that nose is the centre of the\n(channels of the) vital airs: he thus puts it in its own place.\n\n13:4:4:77\\. And what watery (liquid) fire, and what fragrance there was, that\nflowed together and\n\np. 374\n\nburst forth from the eye, and became that tree, the pitudaru; whence that\n(wood) is sweet-smelling, since it originated from fragrance, and whence it is\ninflammable, since it originated from fire: with that quality he thus endows\nit. And because these two (pitudaru stakes) are on the two sides of the\ncentral one, therefore these two eyes are on the two sides of the nose: he\nthus puts those two in their own place.\n\n13:4:4:88\\. And what 'kuntapa 1,' what marrow there was, that flowed together,\nand burst forth from the ear, and became that tree, the bilva; whence all the\nfruit of that (tree) is eatable 2 inside, and whence it (the tree, or wood) is\nyellowish, for marrow is yellowish: with that quality he thus endows it. The\ntwo (sets of) pitudaru (stakes) stand inside, and the bilva ones outside, for\nthe eyes are inside, and the ears outside: he thus puts them in their own\nplace.\n\n13:4:4:99\\. From his (Pra _g_ apati's) bones the khadira, was produced, whence\nthat (tree) is hard and of great strength 3, for hard, as it were, is bone:\nwith that quality he thus endows it. The bilva (stakes) are\n\np. 375\n\ninside, and the khadira ones outside, for inside is the marrow, and outside\nthe bones: he thus puts them in their own place.\n\n13:4:4:1010\\. From his flesh the pala _s_ a was produced, whence that (tree)\nhas much juice, and (that) red juice [1](sbe44106.htm#fn_974), for red, as it\nwere, is flesh: with that quality he thus endows it. The khadira (stakes) are\ninside, and the pala _s_ a ones outside, for inside are the bones, and outside\nis the flesh: he thus puts them in their own place.\n\n13:4:4:1111\\. And as to why there are twenty-one (stakes), twenty-one cubits\nlong,--twenty-one-fold, indeed, is he that shines yonder\n[2](sbe44106.htm#fn_975)\\--there are twelve months, five seasons, these three\nworlds, and yonder sun is the twenty-first, and he is the A _s_ vamedha, and\nthis Pra _g_ apati. Having thus completely restored this Pra _g_ apati, the\nsacrifice, he therein seizes twenty-one Agnishomiya victims: for these there\nis one and the same performance, and this is the performance of the day before\n(the first Sutya).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[371:1](sbe44105.htm#fr_967) Viz. from the day of the setting free the horse,\nnot from that of the mess of rice cooked for the four priests.\n\n[371:2](sbe44105.htm#fr_968) That is, according to the comm., the he-goat\noffered to Pra _g_ apati (along with one, or five, to Vayu) in connection with\nthe building of the fire-altar (which is required for the A _s_ vamedha), see\npart iii, pp. 165 seqq., 171 seqq. The building of the altar, generally\noccupying the space of a year, is apparently compressed on this occasion\nwithin the time of the Diksha and Upasads.\n\n[371:3](sbe44105.htm#fr_969) Viz. the three ish _t_ is to Savit _ri_ performed\ndaily throughout the year.\n\n[371:4](sbe44105.htm#fr_970) One would expect here the middle (sp _ri_ _n_\nute) instead of the active (sp _ri_ _n_ oti); cf. Delbruck, Altind. Syntax, p.\n259.\n\n[372:1](sbe44105.htm#fr_971) See part ii, p. 222 seqq. Whilst there the\noffering of a he-goat to Agni and Soma took place on the Upavasatha, or day\nbefore the Sutya or Soma-day, on the present occasion these preliminary animal\nsacrifices would also seem to be performed on each day from the completion of\nthe Diksha up to the Upavasatha day inclusive (? i.e. on the Upasad days, cf.\nKaty. _S_ r. XX. 3, 9; 4, 21). Moreover, though technically called\nAgnishomiya, the sacrifice--on the Upavasatha day, at all events ([XIII, 4, 4,\n11](sbe44105.htm#13:4:4:11))--is not one of a single he-goat sacred to Agni\nand Soma, but a set of eleven victims distributed over the central eleven\nstakes (of which twenty-one are required on the Soma-days) in the manner\nexplained in III, 9, 1, 1 seqq.\n\n[372:2](sbe44105.htm#fr_972) That is, at the end of each of the three Soma-\nsacrifices, see part ii, p. 454. The Udavasaniya (completing offering) takes\nplace before the carrying round of the sacred water (ib. p. 389 seqq.).\nAccording to Katy. XX, 3, 10-11, however, this singing of the Sacrificer's\npraises along with those of Pra _g_ apati is to take place not only at the\njuncture specified in the text, but also at the beginning of the animal\nsacrifice of the Soma-days, that is, as would seem, prior to the slaying of\nthe victims, at the morning pressing. The wording of our text seems hardly to\nadmit of this interpretation.\n\n[373:1](sbe44105.htm#fr_973) That is, the so-called 'agnish _th_ a,' 'standing\nby (or opposite) the (\xc3\x82havaniya) fire.' Cp. [p. 301](sbe44084.htm#page_301),\nnote [1](sbe44084.htm#fn_761).\n\n[373:2](sbe44105.htm#fr_974) The ra _g_ _g_ udala (or ra _g_ _g_ udala, Say.\non Taitt. Br. III, 8, 19, 1) or 'sleshmataka' is the Cordia Myxa or C.\nlatifolia, from the bark of which (according to Stewart and Brandis, Forest\nFlora of N.W. and Centr. India) ropes (ra _g_ _g_ u) are made, whence\ndoubtless the above, as well as its scientific name, is derived; whilst 'the\nadhesive viscid pulp is used as bird-lime.'\n\n[373:3](sbe44105.htm#fr_975) That is, one on each side, right and left.\n\n[374:1](sbe44105.htm#fr_976) See [p. 264](sbe44071.htm#page_264), note\n[1](sbe44072.htm#fn_660). It would certainly seem to be something connected\nwith the spinal cord.\n\n[374:2](sbe44105.htm#fr_977) According to Stewart and Brandis, the Aegle\nMarmelos is cultivated throughout India, and valued for its fruit, which is\n'globose, oblong, or pyriform, 2 to 5 in. diam., with a smooth, grey or yellow\nrind, and a thick, orange-coloured, sweet aromatic pulp.' The flowers are\nstated to be greenish white, and 'the wood light-coloured, mottled with darker\nwavy lines and small light-coloured dots.'\n\n[374:3](sbe44105.htm#fr_978) The wood of Acacia Catechu is described as dark\nred, and extremely hard and durable, and hence not liable to be attacked by\nwhite ants, and not touched by Teredo navalis; being much used for pestles,\nseed-crushers, cotton-rollers, wheel-wright's work, ploughs, bows, spear and\nsword-handles.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 5, 1.
