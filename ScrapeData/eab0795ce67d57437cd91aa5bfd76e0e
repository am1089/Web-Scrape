But all the same he must be possessed of calmness, subjection of the\nsenses, &c., since those are enjoined as auxiliaries to that, and must\nnecessarily be accomplished.\n\nThe question is whether the householder also must practise calmness and so on,\nor not. The Purvapakshin says he must not, since the performance of works\nimplies the activity of the outer and inner organs of action, and since\ncalmness and so on are of an exactly opposite nature.--This view the Sutra\nsets aside. The householder also, although engaged in outward activity, must,\nin so far as he possesses knowledge, practise calmness of mind and the rest\nalso; for these qualities or states are by Scripture enjoined as auxiliaries\nto knowledge, 'Therefore he who knows this, having become calm, subdued,\nsatisfied, patient, and collected, should see the Self in Self (B _ri_. Up.\nIV, 4, 23). As calmness of mind and the rest are seen, in so far as implying\ncomposure and concentration of mind, to promote the origination of knowledge,\nthey also must necessarily be aimed at and practised. Nor can it be said that\nbetween works on the one side and calmness and so on on the other, there is an\nabsolute antagonism; for the two have different spheres of application.\nActivity of the organs of action is the proper thing in the case of works\nenjoined; quiescence in the case of works not enjoined and\n\np. 701\n\nsuch as have no definite purpose. Nor also can it be objected that in the case\nof works implying the activity of organs, calmness of mind and so on are\nimpossible, the mind then being necessarily engrossed by the impressions of\nthe present work and its surroundings; for works enjoined by Scripture have\nthe power of pleasing the Supreme Person, and hence, through his grace, to\ncause the destruction of all mental impressions obstructive of calmness and\nconcentration of mind. Hence calmness of mind and the rest are to be aimed at\nand practised by householders also.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of\n'calmness' and so on.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 28.
