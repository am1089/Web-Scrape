I implore;  \nLone is the cot so dear before.  \n   No, she is slain by giants; they  \nHave stolen or devoured their prey,  \nOr surely at my mournful cry  \nMy darling to her lord would fly.  \nO Lakshman, see those troops of deer:  \nIn each sad eye there gleams a tear.  \nThose looks of woe too clearly say  \nMy consort is the giants' prey.  \nO noblest, fairest of the fair,  \nWhere art thou. best of women, where?  \nThis day will dark Kaikeyi find  \nFresh triumph for her evil mind,  \nWhen I, who with my Sita came  \nReturn alone, without my dame.  \nBut ne'er can I return to see  \nThose chambers where my queen should be  \nAnd hear the scornful people speak  \n\np. 303  \n\nOf Rama as a coward weak.  \nFor mine will be the coward's shame  \nWho let the foeman steal his dame.  \nHow can I seek my home, or brook  \nUpon Videha's king to look?  \nHow listen, when he bids me tell,  \nMy wanderings o'er, that all is well?  \nHe, when I meet his eager view,  \nWill mark that Sita comes not too,  \nAnd when he hears the mournful tale  \nHis wildered sense will reel and fail.  \n'O Das'aratha.' will he cry,  \n'Blest in thy mansion in the sky!'  \nNe'er to that town my steps shall bend,  \nThat town which Bharat's arms defend,  \nFor e'en the blessed homes above  \nWould seem a waste without my love.  \nLeave me, my brother, here, I pray;  \nTo fair Ayodhya bend thy way.  \nWithout my love I cannot bear  \nTo live one hour in blank despair.  \nRound Bharat's neck thy fond arms twine,  \nAnd greet him with these words of mine:  \n'Dear brother, still the power retain,  \nAnd o'er the land as monarch reign.'  \nWith salutation next incline  \nBefore thy mother, his, and mine.  \nStill, brother, to my words attend,  \nAnd with all care each dame befriend.  \nTo my dear mother's ear relate  \nMy mournful tale and Sita's fate.'  \n   Thus Rama gave his sorrow vent,  \nAnd from a heart which anguish rent,  \nMourned for his wife in loud lament,-  \n   Her of the glorious hair,  \nFrom Lakshman's cheek the colour fled,  \nAnd o'er his heart came sudden dread,  \nSick, faint, and sore disquieted  \n   By woe too great to bear.  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXIV.: Rama's Lament.](ry262.htm)\n\n"
