Arthur William Ryder, [1905], at\nsacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. xi\n\n### PREFACE\n\nTHE text chosen as the basis of this translation is that given in the edition\nof Parab, 1 and I have chosen it for the following reasons. Parab's edition is\nthe most recent, and its editor is a most admirable Sanskrit scholar, who, it\nseems to me, has in several places understood the real meaning of the text\nbetter than his predecessors. This edition contains the comment of\nP\xe1\xb9\x9bthv\xc4\xabdhara; it is far freer from misprints than many texts printed in India,\nand, in respect to arrangement and typography, it is clear and convenient.\nBesides, it is easily obtainable and very cheap. This last consideration may\nprove to be of importance, if the present translation should be found helpful\nin the class-room. For the sake of cataloguers, I note that the proper\ntransliteration of the Sanskrit names of this title according to the rules\nlaid down by the American Library Association in its Journal for 1885, is as\nfollows: M\xe1\xb9\x9bcchaka\xe1\xb9\xadika; \xc3\x87\xc5\xabdraka; P\xe1\xb9\x9bthv\xc4\xabdhara; K\xc4\x81\xc3\xa7\xc4\xabn\xc4\x81tha P\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8dura\xe1\xb9\x85ga Paraba;\nNir\xe1\xb9\x87aya-S\xc4\x81gara.\n\nThe verse-numeration of each act follows the edition of Parab; fortunately, it\nis almost identical with the numeration in the editions of Godabole and\nJ\xc4\xabv\xc4\x81nanda. For the convenience of those who may desire to consult this book in\nconnection with Stenzler's edition, I have added references at the top of the\npage to that edition as well as to the edition of Parab. In these references,\nthe letter P. stands for Parab, the letter S. for Stenzler.\n\nThere are a few passages in which I have deviated from Parab's text. A list of\nsuch passages is given on page [177](lcc18.htm#page_177). From this list\n\np. xii\n\nI have omitted a few minor matters, such as slight misprints and what seem to\nme to be errors in the _ch \xc4\x81y\xc4\x81;_ these matters, and the passages of unusual\ninterest or difficulty, I shall treat in a series of notes on the play, which\nI hope soon to publish in the Journal of the American Oriental Society. It is\nhardly necessary to give reasons for the omission of the passage inserted by\nN\xc4\xablaka\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb9\xadha in the tenth act (Parab, 288.3-292.9). This passage is explicitly\ndeclared by tradition to be an interpolation by another hand, and it is\nclearly shown to be such by internal evidence. It will be noticed that the\nomission of this passage causes a break in the verse-numeration of the tenth\nact, where the verse-number 54 is followed by the number 58.\n\nOf the books which have been useful to me in the present work, I desire to\nmention especially the editions of Stenzler, Godabole, J\xc4\xabv\xc4\x81nanda Vidy\xc4\x81s\xc4\x81gara,\nand Parab; the commentaries of P\xe1\xb9\x9bthv\xc4\xabdhara, Lall\xc4\x81d\xc4\xabk\xe1\xb9\xa3ita, and J\xc4\xabv\xc4\x81nanda;\nfurther, the translations of Wilson, Regnaud, and Bohtlingk.\n\nA number of friends were kind enough to read my manuscript, and each\ncontributed something. I wish to mention especially my friend and pupil, Mr.\nWalter E. Clark, of Harvard University, whose careful reading of both text and\ntranslation was fruitful of many good suggestions.\n\nBut by far my greatest personal indebtedness is to Professor Lanman, whose\ngenerous interest in my work has never flagged from the day when I began the\nstudy of Sanskrit under his guidance. He has criticized this translation with\nthe utmost rigor; indeed, the pages are few which have not witnessed some\nimprovement from his hand. It is to him also that I owe the accuracy and\nbeauty which characterize the printed book; nothing has been hard enough to\nweary him, nothing small enough to escape him.\n\np. xiii\n\nAnd more than all else, I am grateful to him for the opportunity of publishing\nin the Harvard Oriental Series; for this series is that enterprise which,\nsince the death of Professor Whitney, most honorably upholds in this country\nthe standards of accurate scholarship set by the greatest of American\nSanskritists.\n\nARTHUR W.
