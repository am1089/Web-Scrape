This Agni rules over abundance in valiant men, over great happiness. He\nrules over wealth consisting in offspring and cows; he rules over the killing\nof foes.\n\n2\\. O Maruts [1](sbe46076.htm#an_3:16:2:1), ye men, cling to this furtherer\n[2](sbe46076.htm#an_3:16:2:2) who possesses joy-furthering boons--(the Maruts)\nwho [3](sbe46076.htm#an_3:16:2:3) in battles overcome ill-minded (foes), who\nhave deceived the enemy [4](sbe46076.htm#an_3:16:2:4) day by day.\n\n3\\. As such, O bounteous Agni, prepare [1](sbe46076.htm#an_3:16:3:1) us riches\n[2](sbe46076.htm#an_3:16:3:2) and wealth in valiant men, which, O highly\nglorious one, may be most exalted, rich in offspring, free from plagues, and\npowerful.\n\n4\\. The maker who victoriously (stands) over all beings, the maker who makes\nthe praise arrive among the gods [1](sbe46076.htm#an_3:16:4:1): he stands firm\namong the gods, among the host of heroes, firm also in the praise of men.\n\n5\\. Give us not up, Agni, to want of thought [1](sbe46076.htm#an_3:16:5:1) nor\nto want of heroes nor to want of cows, O son of strength, nor to the scoffer.\nDrive away hostile powers [2](sbe46076.htm#an_3:16:5:2).\n\n6\\. Help us at this sacrifice, O blessed one, with mighty gain which is\naccompanied by offspring, O Agni! Let us be united with greater, gladdening,\nglorious wealth, O thou of mighty splendour!\n\np. 274\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi. The metre is Pragatha, each Pragatha distich being composed\nof one B _ri_ hati and one Satob _ri_ hati. The position of the Sukta in the\ncollection and the opening words of verse 3 show that the three Pragathas are\nnot independent, but form one hymn.--Verse 1 = SV. I, 60.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Comp. VII, 18, 25. imam nara _h_ maruta _h_ sa _s_ _k_ ata anu.\n\nNote 2. The passages which Grassmann gives for the meaning of v _r i_dh,\n'starkend, erquickend,' I, 167, 4; X, 89, 10, are quite doubtful. Probably we\nshould have to alter the accent and read v _ri_ dham.\n\nNote 3. The relative clause seems to refer to the Maruts, not to the goods\n(ra\xc2\xb4ya _h_ ).\n\nNote 4. Comp. VI, 46, 10. ye \xe2\x80\xa6 _s_ atrum adabhu _h_.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Literally, 'sharpen.'\n\nNote 2. The genitive seems, as is also Prof. Ludwig's opinion, to be the\npartitive genitive, so that the literal meaning would be: 'Prepare us (a deal)\nof riches and of wealth,' &c. Comp. piba sutasya, 'drink of the pressed Soma,'\n&c.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. On _k_ akri _h_ deveshu a\xc2\xb4 duva _h_ , comp. IV, 2, 9; VIII, 31, 9.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. On amati, comp. above, III, 8, 2, note.\n\nNote 2. Comp. VI, 59, 8. apa dvesha _m_ si a\xc2\xb4 k _ri_ tam.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 17](sbe46077.htm)\n\n"
