Now at the times of the new moon and of the full moon (the following\nceremonies are performed).\n\n2. 2 Let him fast on that full-moon day (when the full moon rises) at the meeting (of day and night).\n\n3. 3 The following day, according to some (teachers).\n\n4\\. And on that day on which the moon is not seen, (he should fast,\nconsidering it) as the new-moon day.\n\n5\\. The ends of the half-months are the time for fasting, the beginnings for\nsacrifice.\n\n6. 6 With the sacrificial food of the new-moon\n\np. 26\n\nsacrifice he celebrates the first half (of the month), with that of the full-\nmoon sacrifice the second.\n\n7. 7 Full-moon is the greatest distance of sun and moon; new-moon is their nearest approach.\n\n8\\. That day on which the moon is not seen, that he should take as the day of\nnew-moon.\n\n9\\. Sometimes he may also while (the moon) is (still) visible (accept it as\nthe day of new-moon); for (already then the moon) has made its way.\n\n10. 10 The time of full-moon is reckoned in three ways: (when the full moon rises at) the meeting (of day and night), or when it rises after sunset, or when it stands high (in the sky at sunset).\n\n11\\. Now on what day it becomes full\xc2\x97\n\n12\\. The doctrine on this point has to be studied\n\np. 27\n\nseparately. One should study it, or should ascertain separately (the exact\ntime of) the Parvan from those who know it.\n\n13\\. Now on the day which is the fast-day, on that day, in the forenoon,\nhaving offered his morning oblation, he besmears that surface on which the\nfire is placed, on all sides with cow-dung.\n\n14\\. He then gets the pieces of wood ready (which are to be put on the\nfire)\xc2\x97of Khadira or of Pala _s_ a wood.\n\n15\\. If Khadira or Pala _s_ a wood cannot be obtained, it may be wood\xc2\x97as far\nas it serves the purpose\xc2\x97of any tree, with the exception of Vibhidaka,\nTilvaka, Badhaka, Niva, Nimba, Ra _g_ av _ri_ ksha, _S_ almali, Aralu,\nDadhittha, Kovidara, _S_ leshmataka wood.\n\n16\\. The Barhis consists of Ku _s_ a grass cut off at the points at which the\nblades diverge from the main stalk.\n\n17\\. (The blades should be) cut off near the roots at (the ceremonies directed\nto) the Fathers.\n\n18\\. If that (i.e. Ku _s_ a grass) cannot be obtained, (he may take) any kind\nof grass, with the exception of _S_ uka grass, of Saccharum reed, of such\ngrass as is apt to break, of Balba _g_ a grass, of Mutava, of Amphidonax reed,\nof _S_ u _n_ _th_ a.\n\n19. 19 (He should get ready the following things, viz.) \xc3\x82 _g_ ya, rice or barley to be cooked for the sacrifice, the pot in which the oblation of cooked rice (or barley) is prepared, the pot-ladle, the Sruva, the water fetched from a hidden place\xc2\x97\n\n20\\. And the other things which we shall mention in the course of (our\nexposition of) the ritual.\n\np. 28\n\n21\\. On that day he should not go away (from his house on a journey, &c.);\n\n22\\. Even from a distant place he should return to his house.\n\n23\\. (On that day) he may buy goods from others, but not sell (such goods).\n\n24\\. Let him not speak much.\n\n25\\. Let him strive to speak the truth.\n\n26. 26 In the afternoon husband and wife, after having bathed, should eat fast-day food which is pleasant to them. It should contain butter (and should be prepared) in the due way.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[25:5](sbe30008.htm#fr_134) Description of the sacrifices of the full and new\nmoon. Paradigm of the regular Sthalipaka offering. The first twelve Sutras of\nthis chapter have been translated by Professor Weber, Ueber den Vedakalender\nnamens Jyotisham, pp. 50 seq.\n\n[25:2](sbe30008.htm#fr_135) See the note below at Sutra 10.\n\n[25:3](sbe30008.htm#fr_136) With these two Sutras, 'sandhya _m_ paur _n_\namasim upavaset; uttaram ity eke,' a passage should be compared which is\nidentically found in the Aitareya (VII, 11), and in the Kaushitaka Brahma _n_\na (III, 1): purva _m_ paur _n_ amasim upavased iti Pai\xe1\xb9\x85gyam, uttaram iti\nKaushitakam.\n\n[25:6](sbe30008.htm#fr_137) The month is reckoned here, as is usually done, as\nbeginning with the fortnight of the increasing moon.\n\n[26:7](sbe30008.htm#fr_138) Here begins a new exposition of the question of\nfull and new moon which stands independently by the side of the former\nsections, and which Gobhila has not taken much care to weld together with\nthem. Comp. Sutra to with Sutras 2 and 3, and Sutra 8 with Sutra 4.\n\n[26:10](sbe30008.htm#fr_139) The first of the three times is that mentioned in\nSutra 2. It seems to me not very safe to interpret sandhya in that modern\nsense, in which sandhi is used, for instance, in the verse quoted by Madhava,\nWeber, Jyotisha 51, so that it designates the meeting-point of the bright and\nof the dark fortnight ('avartane yada sandhi _h_ parvapratipador bhavet,'\n&c.). If sandhya were that, we should expect that the same word would occupy a\nsimilar position in the definition of amavasya. I prefer, therefore, with the\ncommentary, to understand sandhya in its ancient sense, as the time which\ndivides day from night. Thus sandhya paur _n_ amasi, the full-moon day, on\nwhich the moon rises at the meeting of day and night, stands in opposition to\nuttara paur _n_ amasi (Sutra 2), or to astamitodita (scil. paur _n_ amasi,\nSutra 10), exactly in the same way as in the Brahma _n_ a passages quoted\nabove (note on \xc2\xa7 3) purva paur _n_ amasi is opposed to uttara paur _n_ amasi.\nThe second and third cases are those of the full moon rising (shortly) after\nsunset, and of the moon becoming full when standing high in the sky.\n\n[27:19](sbe30008.htm#fr_140) As to anugupta apa _h_ , see above, chap. I, 9.\n\n[28:26](sbe30008.htm#fr_141) Khadira-G _ri_ hya II, 1, 4. 6. The commentary\nexplains ku _s_ alena: it should be easy to digest. Comp. below, II, 1, 2:\n(daran kurvita) laksha _n_ apra _s_ astan ku _s_ alena.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 6](sbe30009.htm)\n\n"
