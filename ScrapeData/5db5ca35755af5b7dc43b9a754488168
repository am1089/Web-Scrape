There is a sublime paradox that\nlies at the root of existence. We never can go round it, because we never can\nstand outside the problem and weigh it against any other possible alternative.\nBut the problem exists in logic only; in reality it does not offer us any\ndifficulty at all. Logically speaking, the distance between two points,\nhowever near, may be said to be infinite because it is infinitely divisible.\nBut we _do_ cross the infinite at every step, and meet the eternal in every\nsecond. Therefore some of our philosophers say there is no such thing as\nfinitude; it is but a _m \xc4\x81y\xc4\x81_, an illusion. The real is the infinite, and it\nis only _m \xc4\x81y\xc4\x81_, the unreality, which causes the appearance of the finite. But\nthe word _m \xc4\x81y\xc4\x81_ is a mere name, it is no explanation. It is merely saying\nthat with truth there is this appearance which is the opposite of truth; but\nhow they come to exist at one and the same time is incomprehensible.\n\nWe have what we call in Sanskrit _dvandva_ , a series of opposites in\ncreation; such as, the positive pole and the negative, the centripetal force\nand the centrifugal, attraction and repulsion. These are also mere names, they\nare no explanations. They are only different ways of asserting that the world\nin its essence is a reconciliation of pairs of opposing forces. These forces,\nlike the left and the right hands of the creator, are acting in absolute\nharmony, yet acting from opposite directions.\n\nThere is a bond of harmony between our two eyes, which makes them act in\nunison. Likewise there is an unbreakable continuity of relation in the\nphysical world between heat and cold, light and darkness, motion and rest, as\nbetween the bass and treble notes of a piano. That is why these opposites do\nnot bring confusion in the universe, but harmony. If creation were but a\nchaos, we should have to imagine the two opposing principles as trying to get\nthe better of each other. But the universe is not under martial law, arbitrary\nand provisional. Here we find no force which can run amok, or go on\nindefinitely in its wild road, like an exiled outlaw, breaking all harmony\nwith its surroundings; each force, on the contrary, has to come back in a\ncurved line to its equilibrium. Waves rise, each to its individual height in a\nseeming attitude of unrelenting competition, but only up to a certain point;\nand thus we know of the great repose of the sea to which they are all related,\nand to which they must all return in a rhythm which is marvellously beautiful.\n\nIn fact, these undulations and vibrations, these risings and fallings, are not\ndue to the erratic contortions of disparate bodies, they are a rhythmic dance.\nRhythm never can be born of the haphazard struggle of combat. Its underlying\nprinciple must be unity, not opposition.\n\nThis principle of unity is the mystery of all mysteries. The existence of a\nduality at once raises a question in our minds, and we seek its solution in\nthe One. When at last we find a relation between these two, and thereby see\nthem as one in essence, we feel that we have come to the truth. And then we\ngive utterance to this most startling of all paradoxes, that the One appears\nas many, that the appearance is the opposite of truth and yet is inseparably\nrelated to it.\n\nCuriously enough, there are men who lose that feeling of mystery, which is at\nthe root of all our delights, when they discover the uniformity of law among\nthe diversity of nature. As if gravitation is not more of a mystery than the\nfall of an apple, as if the evolution from one scale of being to the other is\nnot something which is even more shy of explanation than a succession of\ncreations. The trouble is that we very often stop at such a law as if it were\nthe final end of our search, and then we find that it does not even begin to\nemancipate our spirit. It only gives satisfaction to our intellect, and as it\ndoes not appeal to our whole being it only deadens in us the sense of the\ninfinite.\n\nA great poem, when analysed, is a set of detached sounds. The reader who finds\nout the meaning, which is the inner medium that connects these outer sounds,\ndiscovers a perfect law all through, which is never violated in the least; the\nlaw of the evolution of ideas, the law of the music and the form.\n\nBut law in itself is a limit. It only shows that whatever is can never be\notherwise. When a man is exclusively occupied with the search for the links of\ncausality, his mind succumbs to the tyranny of law in escaping from the\ntyranny of facts. In learning a language, when from mere words we reach the\nlaws of words we have gained a great deal. But if we stop at that point, and\nonly concern ourselves with the marvels of the formation of a language,\nseeking the hidden reason of all its apparent caprices, we do not reach the\nend--for grammar is not literature, prosody is not a poem.\n\nWhen we come to literature we find that though it conforms to rules of grammar\nit is yet a thing of joy, it is freedom itself. The beauty of a poem is bound\nby strict laws, yet it transcends them. The laws are its wings, they do not\nkeep it weighed down, they carry it to freedom. Its form is in law but its\nspirit is in beauty. Law is the first step towards freedom, and beauty is the\ncomplete liberation which stands on the pedestal of law. Beauty harmonises in\nitself the limit and the beyond, the law and the liberty.\n\nIn the world-poem, the discovery of the law of its rhythms, the measurement of\nits expansion and contraction, movement and pause, the pursuit of its\nevolution of forms and characters, are true achievements of the mind; but we\ncannot stop there. It is like a railway station; but the station platform is\nnot our home. Only he has attained the final truth who knows that the whole\nworld is a creation of joy.\n\nThis leads me to think how mysterious the relation of the human heart with\nnature must be. In the outer world of activity nature has one aspect, but in\nour hearts, in the inner world, it presents an altogether different picture.\n\nTake an instance--the flower of a plant. However fine and dainty it may look,\nit is pressed to do a great service, and its colours and forms are all suited\nto its work. It must bring forth the fruit, or the continuity of plant life\nwill be broken and the earth will be turned into a desert ere long. The colour\nand the smell of the flower are all for some purpose therefore; no sooner is\nit fertilised by the bee, and the time of its fruition arrives, than it sheds\nits exquisite petals and a cruel economy compels it to give up its sweet\nperfume. It has no time to flaunt its finery, for it is busy beyond measure.\nViewed from without, necessity seems to be the only factor in nature for which\neverything works and moves. There the bud develops into the flower, the flower\ninto the fruit, the fruit into the seed, the seed into a new plant again, and\nso forth, the chain of activity running on unbroken. Should there crop up any\ndisturbance or impediment, no excuse would be accepted, and the unfortunate\nthing thus choked in its movement would at once be labelled as rejected, and\nbe bound to die and disappear post- haste. In the great office of nature there\nare innumerable departments with endless work going on, and the fine flower\nthat you behold there, gaudily attired and scented like a dandy, is by no\nmeans what it appears to be, but rather, is like a labourer toiling in sun and\nshower, who has to submit a clear account of his work and has no breathing\nspace to enjoy himself in playful frolic.\n\nBut when this same flower enters the heart of men its aspect of busy\npracticality is gone, and it becomes the very emblem of leisure and repose.\nThe same object that is the embodiment of endless activity without is the\nperfect expression of beauty and peace within.\n\nScience here warns us that we are mistaken, that the purpose of a flower is\nnothing but what is outwardly manifested, and that the relation of beauty and\nsweetness which we think it bears to us is all our own making, gratuitous and\nimaginary.\n\nBut our heart replies that we are not in the least mistaken. In the sphere of\nnature the flower carries with it a certificate which recommends it as having\nimmense capacity for doing useful work, but it brings an altogether different\nletter of introduction when it knocks at the door of our hearts. Beauty\nbecomes its only qualification. At one place it comes as a slave, and at\nanother as a free thing. How, then, should we give credit to its first\nrecommendation and disbelieve the second one? That the flower has got its\nbeing in the unbroken chain of causation is true beyond doubt; but that is an\nouter truth. The inner truth is: _Verily from the everlasting joy do all\nobjects have their birth._  39\n\nA flower, therefore, has not its only function in nature, but has another\ngreat function to exercise in the mind of man. And what is that function? In\nnature its work is that of a servant who has to make his appearance at\nappointed times, but in the heart of man it comes like a messenger from the\nKing. In the _R \xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana_, when _S \xc4\xabt\xc4\x81,_ forcibly separated from her husband,\nwas bewailing her evil fate in _Ravana\'s_ golden palace, she was met by a\nmessenger who brought with him a ring of her beloved _R \xc4\x81machandra_ himself.\nThe very sight of it convinced _S \xc4\xabt\xc4\x81_ of the truth of tidings he bore. She\nwas at once reassured that he came indeed from her beloved one, who had not\nforgotten her and was at hand to rescue her.\n\nSuch a messenger is a flower from our great lover. Surrounded with the pomp\nand pageantry of worldliness, which may be linked to Ravana\'s golden city, we\nstill live in exile, while the insolent spirit of worldly prosperity tempts us\nwith allurements and claims us as its bride. In the meantime the flower comes\nacross with a message from the other shore, and whispers in our ears, "I am\ncome. He has sent me. I am a messenger of the beautiful, the one whose soul is\nthe bliss of love. This island of isolation has been bridged over by him, and\nhe has not forgotten thee, and will rescue thee even now. He will draw thee\nunto him and make thee his own. This illusion will not hold thee in thraldom\nfor ever."\n\nIf we happen to be awake then, we question him: "How are we to know that thou\nart come from him indeed?" The messenger says, "Look! I have this ring from\nhim. How lovely are its hues and charms!"\n\nAh, doubtless it is his--indeed, it is our wedding ring. Now all else passes\ninto oblivion, only this sweet symbol of the touch of the eternal love fills\nus with a deep longing. We realise that the palace of gold where we are has\nnothing to do with us--our deliverance is outside it--and there our love has\nits fruition and our life its fulfilment.\n\nWhat to the bee in nature is merely colour and scent, and the marks or spots\nwhich show the right track to the honey, is to the human heart beauty and joy\nuntrammelled by necessity. They bring a love letter to the heart written in\nmany-coloured inks.\n\nI was telling you, therefore, that however busy our active nature outwardly\nmay be, she has a secret chamber within the heart where she comes and goes\nfreely, without any design whatsoever. There the fire of her workshop is\ntransformed into lamps of a festival, the noise of her factory is heard like\nmusic. The iron chain of cause and effect sounds heavily outside in nature,\nbut in the human heart its unalloyed delight seems to sound, as it were, like\nthe golden strings of a harp.\n\nIt indeed seems to be wonderful that nature has these two aspects at one and\nthe same time, and so antithetical--one being of thraldom and the other of\nfreedom. In the same form, sound, colour, and taste two contrary notes are\nheard, one of necessity and the other of joy. Outwardly nature is busy and\nrestless, inwardly she is all silence and peace. She has toil on one side and\nleisure on the other. You see her bondage only when you see her from without,\nbut within her heart is a limitless beauty.\n\nOur seer says, "From joy are born all creatures, by joy they are sustained,\ntowards joy they progress, and into joy they enter."\n\nNot that he ignores law, or that his contemplation of this infinite joy is\nborn of the intoxication produced by an indulgence in abstract thought. He\nfully recognises the inexorable laws of nature, and says, "Fire burns for fear\nof him (i.e. by his law); the sun shines by fear of him; and for fear of him\nthe wind, the clouds, and death perform their offices." It is a reign of iron\nrule, ready to punish the least transgression. Yet the poet chants the glad\nsong, "From joy are born all creatures, by joy they are sustained, towards joy\nthey progress, and into joy they enter."\n\n_The immortal being manifests himself in joy-form._  40 His manifestation in\ncreation is out of his fullness of joy. It is the nature of this abounding joy\nto realise itself in form which is law. The joy, which is without form, must\ncreate, must translate itself into forms. The joy of the singer is expressed\nin the form of a song, that of the poet in the form of a poem. Man in his role\nof a creator is ever creating forms, and they come out of his abounding joy.\n\nThis joy, whose other name is love, must by its very nature have duality for\nits realisation. When the singer has his inspiration he makes himself into\ntwo; he has within him his other self as the hearer, and the outside audience\nis merely an extension of this other self of his. The lover seeks his own\nother self in his beloved. It is the joy that creates this separation, in\norder to realise through obstacles of union.\n\nThe _amritam_ , the immortal bliss, has made himself into two. Our soul is the\nloved one, it is his other self. We are separate; but if this separation were\nabsolute, then there would have been absolute misery and unmitigated evil in\nthis world. Then from untruth we never could reach truth, and from sin we\nnever could hope to attain purity of heart; then all opposites would ever\nremain opposites, and we could never find a medium through which our\ndifferences could ever tend to meet. Then we could have no language, no\nunderstanding, no blending of hearts, no co-operation in life. But on the\ncontrary, we find that the separateness of objects is in a fluid state. Their\nindividualities are even changing, they are meeting and merging into each\nother, till science itself is turning into metaphysics, matter losing its\nboundaries, and the definition of life becoming more and more indefinite.\n\nYes, our individual soul has been separated from the supreme soul, but this\nhas not been from alienation but from the fullness of love. It is for that\nreason that untruths, sufferings, and evils are not at a standstill; the human\nsoul can defy them, can overcome them, nay, can altogether transform them into\nnew power and beauty.\n\nThe singer is translating his song into singing, his joy into forms, and the\nhearer has to translate back the singing into the original joy; then the\ncommunion between the singer and the hearer is complete. The infinite joy is\nmanifesting itself in manifold forms, taking upon itself the bondage of law,\nand we fulfil our destiny when we go back from forms to joy, from law to the\nlove, when we untie the knot of the finite and hark back to the infinite.\n\nThe human soul is on its journey from the law to love, from discipline to\nliberation, from the moral plane to the spiritual. Buddha preached the\ndiscipline of self-restraint and moral life; it is a complete acceptance of\nlaw. But this bondage of law cannot be an end by itself; by mastering it\nthoroughly we acquire the means of getting beyond it. It is going back to\nBrahma, to the infinite love, which is manifesting itself through the finite\nforms of law. Buddha names it _Brahma-vih \xc4\x81ra_, the joy of living in Brahma.\nHe who wants to reach this stage, according to Buddha, "shall deceive none,\nentertain no hatred for anybody, and never wish to injure through anger. He\nshall have measureless love for all creatures, even as a mother has for her\nonly child, whom she protects with her own life. Up above, below, and all\naround him he shall extend his love, which is without bounds and obstacles,\nand which is free from all cruelty and antagonism. While standing, sitting,\nwalking, lying down, till he fall asleep, he shall keep his mind active in\nthis exercise of universal goodwill."\n\nWant of love is a degree of callousness; for love is the perfection of\nconsciousness. We do not love because we do not comprehend, or rather we do\nnot comprehend because we do not love. For love is the ultimate meaning of\neverything around us. It is not a mere sentiment; it is truth; it is the joy\nthat is at the root of all creation. It is the white light of pure\nconsciousness that emanates from Brahma. So, to be one with this _sarv\n\xc4\x81nubh\xc5\xabh_, this all-feeling being who is in the external sky, as well as in our\ninner soul, we must attain to that summit of consciousness, which is love:\n_Who could have breathed or moved if the sky were not filled with joy, with\nlove?_  41 It is through the heightening of our consciousness into love, and\nextending it all over the world, that we can attain _Brahma-vih \xc4\x81ra,_\ncommunion with this infinite joy.\n\nLove spontaneously gives itself in endless gifts. But these gifts lose their\nfullest significance if through them we do not reach that love, which is the\ngiver. To do that, we must have love in our own heart. He who has no love in\nhim values the gifts of his lover only according to their usefulness. But\nutility is temporary and partial. It can never occupy our whole being; what is\nuseful only touches us at the point where we have some want. When the want is\nsatisfied, utility becomes a burden if it still persists. On the other hand, a\nmere token is of permanent worth to us when we have love in our heart. For it\nis not for any special use. It is an end in itself; it is for our whole being\nand therefore can never tire us.\n\nThe question is, In what manner do we accept this world, which is a perfect\ngift of joy? Have we been able to receive it in our heart where we keep\nenshrined things that are of deathless value to us? We are frantically busy\nmaking use of the forces of the universe to gain more and more power; we feed\nand we clothe ourselves from its stores, we scramble for its riches, and it\nbecomes for us a field of fierce competition. But were we born for this, to\nextend our proprietary rights over this world and make of it a marketable\ncommodity? When our whole mind is bent only upon making use of this world it\nloses for us its true value. We make it cheap by our sordid desires; and thus\nto the end of our days we only try to feed upon it and miss its truth, just\nlike the greedy child who tears leaves from a precious book and tries to\nswallow them.\n\nIn the lands where cannibalism is prevalent man looks upon man as his food. In\nsuch a country civilisation can never thrive, for there man loses his higher\nvalue and is made common indeed. But there are other kinds of cannibalism,\nperhaps not so gross, but not less heinous, for which one need not travel far.\nIn countries higher in the scale of civilisation we find sometimes man looked\nupon as a mere body, and he is bought and sold in the market by the price of\nhis flesh only. And sometimes he gets his sole value from being useful; he is\nmade into a machine, and is traded upon by the man of money to acquire for him\nmore money. Thus our lust, our greed, our love of comfort result in cheapening\nman to his lowest value. It is self deception on a large scale. Our desires\nblind us to the _truth_ that there is in man, and this is the greatest wrong\ndone by ourselves to our own soul. It deadens our consciousness, and is but a\ngradual method of spiritual suicide. It produces ugly sores in the body of\ncivilisation, gives rise to its hovels and brothels, its vindictive penal\ncodes, its cruel prison systems, its organised method of exploiting foreign\nraces to the extent of permanently injuring them by depriving them of the\ndiscipline of self- government and means of self-defence.\n\nOf course man is useful to man, because his body is a marvellous machine and\nhis mind an organ of wonderful efficiency. But he is a spirit as well, and\nthis spirit is truly known only by love. When we define a man by the market\nvalue of the service we can expect of him, we know him imperfectly. With this\nlimited knowledge of him it becomes easy for us to be unjust to him and to\nentertain feelings of triumphant self-congratulation when, on account of some\ncruel advantage on our side, we can get out of him much more than we have paid\nfor. But when we know him as a spirit we know him as our own. We at once feel\nthat cruelty to him is cruelty to ourselves, to make him small is stealing\nfrom our own humanity, and in seeking to make use of him solely for personal\nprofit we merely gain in money or comfort what we pay in truth.\n\nOne day I was out in a boat on the Ganges. It was a beautiful evening in\nautumn. The sun had just set; the silence of the sky was full to the brim with\nineffable peace and beauty. The vast expanse of water was without a ripple,\nmirroring all the changing shades of the sunset glow. Miles and miles of a\ndesolate sandbank lay like a huge amphibious reptile of some antediluvian age,\nwith its scales glistening in shining colours. As our boat was silently\ngliding by the precipitous river-bank, riddled with the nest-holes of a colony\nof birds, suddenly a big fish leapt up to the surface of the water and then\ndisappeared, displaying on its vanishing figure all the colours of the evening\nsky. It drew aside for a moment the many-coloured screen behind which there\nwas a silent world full of the joy of life. It came up from the depths of its\nmysterious dwelling with a beautiful dancing motion and added its own music to\nthe silent symphony of the dying day. I felt as if I had a friendly greeting\nfrom an alien world in its own language, and it touched my heart with a flash\nof gladness. Then suddenly the man at the helm exclaimed with a distinct note\nof regret, "Ah, what a big fish!" It at once brought before his vision the\npicture of the fish caught and made ready for his supper. He could only look\nat the fish through his desire, and thus missed the whole truth of its\nexistence. But man is not entirely an animal. He aspires to a spiritual\nvision, which is the vision of the whole truth. This gives him the highest\ndelight, because it reveals to him the deepest harmony that exists between him\nand his surroundings. It is our desires that limit the scope of our self-\nrealisation, hinder our extension of consciousness, and give rise to sin,\nwhich is the innermost barrier that keeps us apart from our God, setting up\ndisunion and the arrogance of exclusiveness. For sin is not one mere action,\nbut it is an attitude of life which takes for granted that our goal is finite,\nthat our self is the ultimate truth, and that we are not all essentially one\nbut exist each for his own separate individual existence.\n\nSo I repeat we never can have a true view of man unless we have a love for\nhim. Civilisation must be judged and prized, not by the amount of power it has\ndeveloped, but by how much it has evolved and given expression to, by its laws\nand institutions, the love of humanity. The first question and the last which\nit has to answer is, Whether and how far it recognises man more as a spirit\nthan a machine? Whenever some ancient civilisation fell into decay and died,\nit was owing to causes which produced callousness of heart and led to the\ncheapening of man\'s worth; when either the state or some powerful group of men\nbegan to look upon the people as a mere instrument of their power; when, by\ncompelling weaker races to slavery and trying to keep them down by every\nmeans, man struck at the foundation of his greatness, his own love of freedom\nand fair-play. Civilisation can never sustain itself upon cannibalism of any\nform. For that by which alone man is true can only be nourished by love and\njustice.\n\nAs with man, so with this universe. When we look at the world through the veil\nof our desires we make it small and narrow, and fail to perceive its full\ntruth. Of course it is obvious that the world serves us and fulfils our needs,\nbut our relation to it does not end there. We are bound to it with a deeper\nand truer bond than that of necessity. Our soul is drawn to it; our love of\nlife is really our wish to continue our relation with this great world. This\nrelation is one of love. We are glad that we are in it; we are attached to it\nwith numberless threads, which extend from this earth to the stars. Man\nfoolishly tries to prove his superiority by imagining his radical separateness\nfrom what he calls his physical world, which, in his blind fanaticism, he\nsometimes goes to the extent of ignoring altogether, holding it at his direst\nenemy. Yet the more his knowledge progresses, the more it becomes difficult\nfor man to establish this separateness, and all the imaginary boundaries he\nhad set up around himself vanish one after another. Every time we lose some of\nour badges of absolute distinction by which we conferred upon our humanity the\nright to hold itself apart from its surroundings, it gives us a shock of\nhumiliation. But we have to submit to this. If we set up our pride on the path\nof our self-realisation to create divisions and disunion, then it must sooner\nor later come under the wheels of truth and be ground to dust. No, we are not\nburdened with some monstrous superiority, unmeaning in its singular\nabruptness. It would be utterly degrading for us to live in a world\nimmeasurably less than ourselves in the quality of soul, just as it would be\nrepulsive and degrading to be surrounded and served by a host of slaves, day\nand night, from birth to the moment of death. On the contrary, this world is\nour compeer, nay, we are one with it.\n\nThrough our progress in science the wholeness of the world and our oneness\nwith it is becoming clearer to our mind. When this perception of the\nperfection of unity is not merely intellectual, when it opens out our whole\nbeing into a luminous consciousness of the all, then it becomes a radiant joy,\nan overspreading love. Our spirit finds its larger self in the whole world,\nand is filled with an absolute certainty that it is immortal. It dies a\nhundred times in its enclosures of self; for separateness is doomed to die, it\ncannot be made eternal. But it never can die where it is one with the all, for\nthere is its truth, its joy. When a man feels the rhythmic throb of the soul-\nlife of the whole world in his own soul, then is he free. Then he enters into\nthe secret courting that goes on between this beautiful world-bride, veiled\nwith the veil of the many-coloured finiteness, and the _paramatmam_ , the\nbridegroom, in his spotless white. Then he knows that he is the partaker of\nthis gorgeous love festival, and he is the honoured guest at the feast of\nimmortality. Then he understands the meaning of the seer-poet who sings, "From\nlove the world is born, by love it is sustained, towards love it moves, and\ninto love it enters."\n\nIn love all the contradictions of existence merge themselves and are lost.\nOnly in love are unity and duality not at variance. Love must be one and two\nat the same time.\n\nOnly love is motion and rest in one. Our heart ever changes its place till it\nfinds love, and then it has its rest. But this rest itself is an intense form\nof activity where utter quiescence and unceasing energy meet at the same point\nin love.\n\nIn love, loss and gain are harmonised. In its balance-sheet, credit and debit\naccounts are in the same column, and gifts are added to gains. In this\nwonderful festival of creation, this great ceremony of self-sacrifice of God,\nthe lover constantly gives himself up to gain himself in love. Indeed, love is\nwhat brings together and inseparably connects both the act of abandoning and\nthat of receiving.\n\nIn love, at one of its poles you find the personal, and at the other the\nimpersonal. At one you have the positive assertion-- Here I am; at the other\nthe equally strong denial--I am not. Without this ego what is love? And again,\nwith only this ego how can love be possible?\n\nBondage and liberation are not antagonistic in love. For love is most free and\nat the same time most bound. If God were absolutely free there would be no\ncreation. The infinite being has assumed unto himself the mystery of finitude.\nAnd in him who is love the finite and the infinite are made one.\n\nSimilarly, when we talk about the relative values of freedom and non-freedom,\nit becomes a mere play of words. It is not that we desire freedom alone, we\nwant thraldom as well. It is the high function of love to welcome all\nlimitations and to transcend them. For nothing is more independent than love,\nand where else, again, shall we find so much of dependence? In love, thraldom\nis as glorious as freedom.\n\nThe _Vaishnava_ religion has boldly declared that God has bound himself to\nman, and in that consists the greatest glory of human existence. In the spell\nof the wonderful rhythm of the finite he fetters himself at every step, and\nthus gives his love out in music in his most perfect lyrics of beauty. Beauty\nis his wooing of our heart; it can have no other purpose. It tells us\neverywhere that the display of power is not the ultimate meaning of creation;\nwherever there is a bit of colour, a note of song, a grace of form, there\ncomes the call for our love. Hunger compels us to obey its behests, but hunger\nis not the last word for a man. There have been men who have deliberately\ndefied its commands to show that the human soul is not to be led by the\npressure of wants and threat of pain. In fact, to live the life of man we have\nto resist its demands every day, the least of us as well as the greatest. But,\non the other hand, there is a beauty in the world which never insults our\nfreedom, never raises even its little finger to make us acknowledge its\nsovereignty. We can absolutely ignore it and suffer no penalty in consequence.\nIt is a call to us, but not a command. It seeks for love in us, and love can\nnever be had by compulsion. Compulsion is not indeed the final appeal to man,\nbut joy is. Any joy is everywhere; it is in the earth\'s green covering of\ngrass; in the blue serenity of the sky; in the reckless exuberance of spring;\nin the severe abstinence of grey winter; in the living flesh that animates our\nbodily frame; in the perfect poise of the human figure, noble and upright; in\nliving; in the exercise of all our powers; in the acquisition of knowledge; in\nfighting evils; in dying for gains we never can share. Joy is there\neverywhere; it is superfluous, unnecessary; nay, it very often contradicts the\nmost peremptory behests of necessity. It exists to show that the bonds of law\ncan only be explained by love; they are like body and soul.
