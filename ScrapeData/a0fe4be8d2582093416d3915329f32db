[1](ry475.htm#fn_1016)  \nThen Rama, troubled by the storm  \nOf flying darts in every form  \nShot by an arm that naught could tire,  \nLaunched at the foe his dart of fire,  \nWhich, sacred to the Lord of Flame,  \nBurnt and consumed where'er it came.  \nAnd many a blazing shaft beside  \nThe hero to his string applied.  \nWith fiery course of dazzling hue  \nSwift to the mark each missile flew,  \nSome flashing like a shooting star,  \nSome as the tongues of lightning are;  \nOne like a brilliant plant, one  \nIn splendour like the morning sun.  \nWhere'er the shafts of Rama burned  \nThe giant's darts were foiled and turned.  \nFar into space his weapons fled,  \nBut as they flew struck thousands dead.  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto CI.: Lakshman's Fall.](ry475.htm)\n\n"
