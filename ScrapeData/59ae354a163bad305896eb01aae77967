We may introduce the strictest rules of metre, determining the length\nor shortness of every syllable, and then ignore all rules of grammar and\nquantity, treat short syllables as long, or long ones as short, and thus\nsecure the triumph of metre. Or, we may allow great latitude in Vedic metres,\nparticularly in certain padas, and thus retain all the rules of grammar which\ndetermine the quantity of syllables. It may be said even that the result would\nreally be the same in either case, and that the policy of 'thorough' might\nperhaps prove most useful in the end. It may be so hereafter, but in the\npresent state of Vedic scholarship it seems more expedient to be guided by\nnative tradition, and to study the compromise which the ancient students of\nthe Veda have tried to effect between grammar on one side and metre on the\nother.\n\nNow it has generally been supposed that the Prati _s_ akhya teaches that there\nmust be a long syllable in the eighth or tenth place of Traish _t_ ubha and\n_G_ agata, and in the sixth place of \xc3\x82nush _t_ ubha padas. This is not the\ncase. The Prati _s_ akhya, no doubt, says, that a short final vowel, but not\nany short syllable, occupying the eighth or tenth place in a Traish _t_ ubha\nand _G_ agata pada, or the sixth place in a Gayatra pada, is lengthened, but\nit never says that it must be lengthened; on the contrary, it gives a number\nof cases where it is not so lengthened. But, what is even more important, the\nPrati _s_ akhya distinctly adds a proviso which shows that the ancient critics\nof the Veda did not consider the trochee as the only possible foot for the\nsixth and seventh syllables of Gayatra, or for the eighth and ninth, or tenth\nand eleventh syllables of Traish _t_ ubha and _G_ agata padas. They distinctly\nadmit that the seventh and the\n\np. xc\n\nninth and the eleventh syllables in such padas may be long, and that in that\ncase the preceding short vowel is not lengthened. We thus get the iambus in\nthe very place which is generally occupied by the trochee. According to the\nPrati _s_ akhya, the general scheme for the Gayatra would be, not only\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n6\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n7\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n  \n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n \xcc\x84\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n \xcc\x86\n\n|\n\n,  \n  \nbut also\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n6\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n7\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n  \n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n \xcc\x86\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n \xcc\x84\n\n|\n\n;  \n  \nand for the Traish _t_ ubha and _G_ agata, not only\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n8\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n9\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n  \n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n \xcc\x84\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n \xcc\x86\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n( + ),\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \nbut also\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n8\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n9\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n  \n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n \xcc\x86\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n \xcc\x84\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n( + ),\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \nAnd again, for the same padas, not only\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n10\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n11\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n  \n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n \xcc\x84\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n \xcc\x86\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n( + ),\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \nbut also\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n10\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n11\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n  \n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n \xcc\x86\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n \xcc\x84\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n( + ),\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \nBefore appealing, however, to the Prati _s_ akhya for the establishment of\nsuch a rule as that the sixth syllable of \xc3\x82nush _t_ ubha and the eighth or\ntenth syllable of Traish _t_ ubha and _G_ agata padas must be lengthened,\nprovided a short syllable follows, it is indispensable that we should have a\nclear appreciation of the real character of the Prati _s_ akhya. If we\ncarefully follow the thread which runs through these books, we shall soon\nperceive that, even with the proviso that a short syllable follows, the Prati\n_s_ akhya never teaches that certain final vowels must be lengthened. The\nobject of the Prati _s_ akhya, as I pointed out on a former occasion, is to\nregister all the facts which possess a phonetic interest. In doing this, all\nkinds of plans are adopted in order to bring as large a number of cases as\npossible under general categories. These categories are purely technical and\nexternal, and they never assume, with the authors of the Prati _s_ akhya, the\ncharacter of general rules. Let us now, after these preliminary remarks,\nreturn to the Sutras 523 to 535, which we discussed before. The Prati _s_\nakhya simply says that certain syllables which are short in the\n\np. xci\n\n[paragraph continues] Pada, if occupying a certain place in a verse, are\nlengthened in the Sa _m_ hita, provided a short syllable follows. This looks,\nno doubt, like a general rule which should be carried out under all\ncircumstances. But this idea never entered the minds of the authors of the\nPrati _s_ akhya. They only give this rule as the most convenient way of\nregistering the lengthening of certain syllables which have actually been\nlengthened in the text of the Sa _m_ hita, while they remain short in the\nPada; and after having done this, they proceed to give a number of verses\nwhere the same rule might be supposed to apply, but where in the text of the\nSa _m_ hita the short syllable has not been lengthened. After having given a\nlong string of words which are short in the Pada and long in the Sa _m_ hita,\nand where no intelligible reason of their lengthening can be given, at least\nnot by the authors of the Prati _s_ akhya, the Prati _s_ akhya adds in Sutra\n523, 'The final vowel of the eighth syllable is lengthened in padas of eleven\nand twelve syllables, provided a syllable follows which is short in the Sa _m_\nhita.' As instances the commentator gives (Sa _m_ hita text):\n\nI, 32, 4. ta\xcc\x84di\xcc\x85\xc2\xb4tna\xcc\x84 _s_ a\xcc\x84t\xcc\x8dru\xcc\x84m na\xcc\x86 ki\xcc\x86la\xcc\x86\xcc\x82 \xcc\x8d vi\xcc\x86vi\xcc\x84tse\xcc\x84.\n\nI, 94, 1. a\xcc\x84gne\xcc\x84 sa\xcc\x84khye\xcc\x84 m\xcc\x8da\xc2\xb4 ri\xcc\x86sha\xcc\x84ma\xcc\x86\xcc\x82 v\xcc\x8da\xcc\x86ya\xcc\x84m ta\xcc\x86va\xcc\x86.\n\nThen follows another rule (Sutra 525) that 'The final vowel of the tenth\nsyllable in padas of eleven and twelve syllables is lengthened, provided a\nsyllable follows which is short in the Sa _m_ hita.' As instances the\ncommentator gives:\n\nIII, 54, 22. a\xcc\x86ha\xcc\x84 vi\xcc\x84 _s_ va\xcc\x84 \xcc\x8d su\xcc\x86ma\xcc\x86na\xcc\x84 di\xcc\x84\xcc\x8ddi\xcc\x86hi\xcc\x86\xcc\x82 na\xcc\x84 _h_.\n\nII, 34, 9. a\xcc\x86va\xcc\x86 ru\xcc\x84dra\xcc\x84\xcc\x8d a\xcc\x86sa\xcc\x86so\xcc\x84 ha\xcc\x84n\xcc\x8dta\xcc\x86na\xcc\x86\xcc\x82 va\xcc\x86dha\xcc\x84 _h_.\n\nLastly a rule is given (Sutra 526) that 'The final vowel of the sixth syllable\nis lengthened in a pada of eight syllables, provided a syllable follows which\nis short\n\nI, 5, 10. i\xcc\x85\xc2\xb4 _s_ a\xcc\x84no\xcc\x84 ya\xcc\x86v\xcc\x8da\xcc\x86ya\xcc\x86\xcc\x82 va\xcc\x86dha\xcc\x84m.\n\nIf the seventh syllable is long no change takes place:\n\nIX. 67, 30. a\xcc\x85\xc2\xb4 pa\xcc\x86va\xcc\x84sva\xcc\x84 de\xcc\x84va\xcc\x86 so\xcc\x84ma\xcc\x84.\n\nWhile we ourselves should look upon these rules as\n\np. xcii\n\nfounded in the very nature of the metre, which, no doubt, to a certain extent\nthey are, the authors of the Prati _s_ akhya use them simply as convenient\nnets for catching as many cases as possible of lengthened syllables actually\noccurring in the text of the Sa _m_ hita. For this purpose, and in order to\navoid giving a number of special rules, they add in this place an observation,\nvery important to us as throwing light on the real pronunciation of the Vedic\nhymns at the time when our Sa _m_ hita text was finally settled, but with them\nagain a mere expedient for enlarging the preceding rules, and thus catching\nmore cases of lengthening at one haul. They say in Sutra 527, that in order to\nget the right number of syllables in such verses, we must pronounce sometimes\none syllable as two. Thus only can the lengthened syllable be got into one of\nthe places required by the preceding Sutra, viz. the sixth, the eighth, or the\ntenth place, and thus only can a large number of lengthened syllables be\ncomprehended under the same general rule of the Prati _s_ akhya. In all this\nwe ourselves can easily recognise a principle which guided the compilers of\nthe Sa _m_ hita text, or the very authors of the hymns, in lengthening\nsyllables which in the Pada text are short, and which were liable to be\nlengthened because they occupied certain places on which the stress of the\nmetre would naturally fall. We also see quite clearly that these compilers, or\nthose whose pronunciation they tried to perpetuate, must have pronounced\ncertain syllables as two syllables, and we naturally consider that we have a\nright to try the same expedient in other cases where to us, though not to\nthem, the metre seems deficient, and where it could be rendered perfect by\npronouncing one syllable as two. Such thoughts, however, never entered the\nminds of the authors of the Prati _s_ akhyas, who are satisfied with\nexplaining what is, according to the authority of the Sa _m_ hita, and who\nnever attempt to say what ought to be, even against the authority of the Sa\n_m_ hita. While in some cases they have ears to hear and to appreciate the\nnatural flow of the poetical language of the _Ri_ shis, they seem at other\ntimes as deaf as the adder to the voice of the charmer.\n\np. xciii\n\nA general rule, therefore, in our sense of the word, that the eighth syllable\nin hendecasyllabics and dodecasyllabics, the tenth syllable in\nhendecasyllabics and dodecasyllabics, and the sixth syllable in octosyllabics\nshould be lengthened, rests in no sense on the authority of ancient\ngrammarians. Even as a mere observation, they restrict it by the condition\nthat the next syllable must be short, in order to provoke the lengthening of\nthe preceding syllable, thereby sanctioning, of course, many exceptions; and\nthey then proceed to quote a number of cases where, in spite of all, the short\nsyllable remains short a. In some of these quotations they are no doubt wrong,\nbut in most of them their statement cannot be disputed.\n\nAs to the eighth syllable being short in hendecasyllabics and dodecasyllabics,\nthey quote such verses as,\n\nVI, 66, 4. a\xcc\x84nta\xcc\x84r (iti) sa\xcc\x84nta\xcc\x86 _h_ a\xcc\x86va\xcc\x84dya\xcc\x84ni\xcc\x86 pu\xcc\x86na\xcc\x84na\xcc\x84 _h_.\n\nThus we see that in VI, 44. 9, va\xcc\x84rshi\xcc\x84ya\xcc\x84 _h_ va\xcc\x86ya\xcc\x84 _h_ k _ri \xcc\x86_ _n_ u\xcc\x86hi\xcc\x86\n_s_ a\xcc\x86 _k_ i\xcc\x84bhi\xcc\x84 _h_ , hi remains short; while in VI, 25, 3, _g_ a\xcc\x86hi\xcc\x86 v _ri\n\xcc\x85_sh _n_ ya\xcc\x84ni\xcc\x86 k _ri \xcc\x86_ _n_ u\xcc\x86hi\xcc\x84 pa\xcc\x86ra\xcc\x84 _k_ a\xcc\x84 _h_ , it is lengthened in the\nSa _m_ hita, the only difference being that in the second passage the accent\nis on hi.\n\nAs to the tenth syllable being short in a dodecabyllabic, they quote\n\nII, 27, 14. a\xcc\x86di\xcc\x86te\xcc\x84 mi\xcc\x84tra\xcc\x86 va\xcc\x86ru\xcc\x86 _n_ a\xcc\x86 u\xcc\x86ta\xcc\x86 m _ri \xcc\x86_ _l_ a\xcc\x84.\n\nAs to the tenth syllable being short in a hendecasyllabic, they quote\n\nII, 20, 1. v\xcc\x86aya\xcc\x84m te\xcc\x84 va\xcc\x86ya\xcc\x86 _h_ i\xcc\x84ndra\xcc\x86 vi\xcc\x84ddhi\xcc\x86 su\xcc\x86 na\xcc\x84 _h_.\n\nAs to the sixth syllable being short in an octosyllabic, they quote\n\nVIII, 23, 26. ma\xcc\x86ha\xcc\x84 _h_ vi\xcc\x84 _s_ va\xcc\x84n a\xcc\x86bhi\xcc\x86 sa\xcc\x86ta\xcc\x84 _h_.\n\nA large number of similar exceptions are collected from\n\np. xciv\n\n[paragraph continues] 528, 3 to 534, 94, and this does not include any cases\nwhere the ninth, the eleventh, or the seventh syllable is long, instead of\nbeing short, while it does include cases where the eighth syllable is long,\nthough the ninth is not short, or, at least, is not short according to the\nviews of the collectors of these passages. See Sutra 522, 6.\n\nBesides the cases mentioned by the Prati _s_ akhya itself, where a short\nsyllable, though occupying a place which would seem to require lengthening,\nremains short, there are many others which the Prati _s_ akhya does not\nmention, because, from its point of view, there was no necessity for doing so.\nThe Prati _s_ akhya has been blamed a for omitting such cases as I, 93, 6, uru\n_m_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ aya _k_ akrathu\xcc\x86r u lokam; or I, 96, 1, deva agnim dharayan\ndra\xcc\x86vi _n_ odam. But though occupying the eighth place, and though followed by\na short syllable, these syllables could never fall under the general\nobservation of the Prati _s_ akhya, because that general observation refers to\nfinal vowels only, but not to short syllables in general. Similar cases are I,\n107, 1a; 122, 9; 130, 10; 152, 6; 154, 1; 158, 5a; 163, 2; 167, 10a; 171, 4;\n173, 6; 179, 1a; 182, 8a; 186, 6, &c.\n\nIf, therefore, we say that, happen what may, these metrical rules must be\nobserved, and the text of the Veda altered in order to satisfy the\nrequirements of these rules, we ought to know at all events that we do this on\nour own responsibility, and that we cannot shield ourselves behind the\nauthority of _S_ aunaka or Katyayana. Now it is well known that Professor Kuhn\nb has laid down the rule that the Traish _t_ ubha padas must end in a bacchius\nor amphibrachys  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84\xcc\x86, and the _G_ agata padas in a dijambus or paeon\nsecundus  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84\xcc\x86. With regard to \xc3\x82nush _t_ ubha padas, he requires the\ndijambus or paeon secundus  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84\xcc\x86 at the end of a whole verse only,\nallowing greater freedom in the formation of the preceding padas. In a later\narticle,\n\np. xcv\n\nhowever, the final pada, too, in \xc3\x82nush _t_ ubha metre is allowed greater\nfreedom, and the rule, as above given, is strictly maintained with regard to\nthe Traish _t_ ubha and _G_ agata padas only.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xciii:a](sbe3211.htm#fr_54) 'Wo die achtsilbigen Reihen mit herbeigezogen\nsind, ist es in der Regel bei solchen Liedern geschehen, die im Ganzen von der\nregelmassigen Form weniger abweichen, und fur solche Falle, wo auch das Prati\n_s_ akhya die Langung der sechsten Silbe in achtsilbigen Reihen vorschreibt,\nnamlich wo die siebente von Natur kurz ist.
