If (it is said that the effect is) non-existent (before its origination);\nwe do not allow that because it is a mere negation (without an object).\n\nIf Brahman, which is intelligent, pure, and devoid of qualities such as sound,\nand so on, is supposed to be the cause of an effect which is of an opposite\nnature, i. e. non-intelligent, impure, possessing the qualities of sound, &c.,\nit follows that the effect has to be considered as non-existing before its\nactual origination. But this consequence cannot be acceptable to you--the\nVedantin--who maintain the doctrine of the effect existing in the cause\nalready.\n\nThis objection of yours, we reply, is without any force, on account of its\nbeing a mere negation. If you negative the existence of the effect previous to\nits actual origination, your negation is a mere negation without an object to\nbe negatived. The negation (implied in 'non-existent') can certainly not have\nfor its object the existence of the effect previous to its origination, since\nthe effect must be viewed as 'existent,' through and in the Self of the cause,\nbefore its origination as well as after it; for at the present moment also\nthis effect does not exist independently, apart from the cause; according to\nsuch scriptural passages as, 'Whosoever looks for anything elsewhere than in\nthe Self is abandoned by everything' (B _ri_. Up. II, 4, 6). In so far, on the\nother hand, as the effect exists through the Self of the cause, its existence\nis the same before the actual beginning of the effect (as after it).--But\nBrahman, which is devoid of qualities such as sound, &c., is the cause of this\nworld (possessing all those qualities)!--True, but the effect with all its\nqualities does not exist without the Self of the cause either now or before\nthe actual beginning (of the effect); hence it cannot be said that (according\nto our doctrine) the effect is non-existing before its actual beginning.--This\npoint will be elucidated in detail in the section treating of the non-\ndifference of cause and effect.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1, 8](sbe34147.htm)\n\n"
