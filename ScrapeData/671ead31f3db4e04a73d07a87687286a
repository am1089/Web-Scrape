Victorious [1](sbe46017.htm#an_1:67:1:1) in the forests, a friend among\nmen, he demands obedience like a king, the undecaying one\n[2](sbe46017.htm#an_1:67:1:2).\n\n2\\. Like good peace, like fortunate wisdom, may he (Agni) be a kind Hot _ri_ ,\na carrier of offerings.\n\n3\\. Having taken in his hand all manly powers, he has made the gods fear, when\nsitting down in his hiding-place.\n\n4\\. There the thoughtful men find him, when they have recited the spells which\nthey had fashioned in their heart.\n\n5\\. As the goat [1](sbe46017.htm#an_1:67:5:1) (supports) the earth\n[2](sbe46017.htm#an_1:67:5:2), thus he supports the earth\n[2](sbe46017.htm#an_1:67:5:2); he upholds the sky by his efficacious spells.\n\n6\\. Protect the dear [1](sbe46017.htm#an_1:67:6:1) footsteps of the cattle\n[2](sbe46017.htm#an_1:67:6:2). O Agni, thou who hast a full life, thou hast\ngone from covert to covert [3](sbe46017.htm#an_1:67:6:3).\n\n7\\. He who has seen him the hidden one, he who has got near to the stream of\n_Ri_ ta [1](sbe46017.htm#an_1:67:7:1)--\n\n8\\. They who get him off, doing service to _Ri_ ta, to him\n[1](sbe46017.htm#an_1:67:8:1) he then indicates riches.\n\n9\\. He who grows up with might within the plants, and within the children\n[1](sbe46017.htm#an_1:67:9:1), and within the sprouting grass\n[2](sbe46017.htm#an_1:67:9:2)--\n\n10\\. The splendour [?] in the home of the waters\n[1](sbe46017.htm#an_1:67:10:1), the full-lived. The sages made him as if\nbuilding a seat.\n\np. 62\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi and metre.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. ' _G_ ayu _h_ : aus _g_ yayu _h_ , wie der compar. _g_ yayan _g_ yesh\n_th_ a _h_ zeigt,' Ludwig. But what shows that _g_ yayan is the comparative of\n_g_ ayu _h_ and that the utterly impossible change of _g_ y into _g_ is\npossible? Ludwig's translation 'uberwindend' is right; comp. I, 119, 3.\n\nNote 2. I propose to read a _g_ urya _h_. Prof. Max Muller conjectures--as\nRoth (Pet. Dict.) has done--that _s_ rush _t_ i may mean 'obedient, servant;'\nhe translates: 'He desires a servant (or worshipper) who is not aged.'\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. On the mythical goat whose office it is to support the worlds, comp.\nI, 164, 6; VIII, 41, 10; X, 82, 6; Bergaigne, III, 21; H. O., Religion des\nVeda, 72.\n\nNote 2. For 'earth' the text has two different words, ksha\xc2\xb4m and p _ri_\nthivi\xc2\xb4m. Prof. Max Muller conjectures dya\xc2\xb4m for ksha\xc2\xb4m: 'He, Agni, supports\nthe earth, as the buck the sky.'\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Literally, 'the dear footsteps;' but the meaning of priya may be\ncompared to that of the Homeric \xcf\x86\xce\xaf\xce\xbb\xce\xbf\xcf\x82, his own.\n\nNote 2. One could be tempted to refer the word pa _s_ u to Agni, whose\nfootsteps (pada\xc2\xb4ni) the 'wise ones' follow (65, 2), and whom they find out in\nhis hiding. Thus we could translate, 'Look at the dear footsteps of the\nbeast.' But the comparison of 70, 6 makes it more probable that the imperative\nni pahi is addressed to Agni. I believe therefore that Grassmann is right in\ntranslating 'Die lieben Statten der Heerden schutze.' Ludwig's translation is\n\np. 63\n\nsimilar to this. Prof. Max Muller translates: 'Observe the footsteps of the\nanimal (the stolen animal of the thief Agni).'\n\nNote 3. With guha\xc2\xb4 guham comp. I, 53, 7. yudha\xc2\xb4 yudham, pura\xc2\xb4 puram.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. Dha\xc2\xb4ram _ri_ tasya: comp. V, 1 2, 2. _ri_ tasya dha\xc2\xb4ra _h_ anu t _ri_\nndhi purvi\xc2\xb4 _h_ , 'open the many streams of _Ri_ ta;' VII, 43, 4. _ri_ tasya\ndha\xc2\xb4ra _h_ sudugha _h_ duhana _h_ , 'milking the streams of _Ri_ ta flowing\nwith plenty.' The stream of _Ri_ ta seems to mean the stream of blessings\n(such as rain, ghee, &c.) which flows to mankind according to the eternal laws\nof _Ri_ ta.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. The poet passes over from the plural to the singular.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. Bollensen's conjecture pra _g_ a\xc2\xb4su (instead of pra _g_ a\xc2\xb4 _h_ uta)\nseems very probable to me. Prof. von Roth (Ueber gewisse Kurzungen des\nWortendes, p. 2) takes a different view.\n\nNote 2. Comp. I, 95, 10 (see below); VII, 9, 3. apa\xc2\xb4m garbha _h_ prasv\xcc\x83a _h_\na\xc2\xb4 vive _s_ a, 'the son of the waters has entered upon the sprouting grass.'\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. 'Why not _k_ iti _h_ apam dame, that is, the (burning) pile in the\nhome of the waters.' M. M.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 68](sbe46018.htm)\n\n"
