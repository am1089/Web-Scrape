Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus getting the boons from the Devi, the Devas\nand the Ri _s_ is blazing with their asceticism, all united and consulted with\neach other; then they went to the excellent \xc3\x82s'rama of V _r_ itra. There they\nsaw V _r_ itra in a sitting posture and with his own Tejas (fiery spirit in\nhim) as if ready to burn the three worlds and to devour all the Devas. The Ri\n_s_ is, then, spoke to V _r_ itra the sweet words full of sentiments for the\nserving of the Devas' ends, according to the principle of conciliation.\n\n\n\n4-23. \xc2\x93O highly fortunate V _r_ itra! Terrific to all the Lokas! Yo have now\nestablished your dominion in all the places over this whole Universe; but your\nenmity with Indra is the only cause to interrupt you in your happiness; there\nis no doubt in this. This enmity has increased much the anxiety of you both\nand therefore has grown very painful. Neither you nor Indra can go to sleep\npeacefully, there is always that fear hanging on you both, on account of that\nenmity. And, see! A long long while has passed away since the last battle was\nfought between you two; yet all the Devas, Asuras, men and other subjects, are\nfeeling a sense\n\n\n\np. 500\n\n\n\nof oppression and pain. In this world happiness is the only thing to be sought\nfor and pain is to be avoided; this is the eternal state of things. Never does\nthat man who practises enmity with another, get happiness; this has been\nascertained by the wise. It is only those brave warriors, that found taste in\nwarfare, that approve of battles; but the wise that are expert in amorous\nenjoyments do not like battle as destroying the sensual enjoyments; they do\nnot like fighting with flowers even; what to say with sharpened arrows! In a\nbattle, the victory is doubtful but the shooting of arrows is certain, This\nworld is dependent on Fate (Daiva, i.e., dependent on the cosmic rulers or\ndeities or Devas of the Universe), so is victory or defeat. So knowing this,\none ought never to fight. Bathing in proper time, taking food and sleeping in\nfixed times and having a chaste serving wife, these are the means towards\nhappiness in this world. While in warfares, shooting terrible arrows and\nstriking with fierce axes take place; what happiness can there possibly exist?\nRather the enemy finds pleasure there. There is a saying that death in battles\nleads one to Heaven, but this is merely an enticing statement, inciting one to\nwar! Really it is fruitless. Supposing that happiness comes ultimately to\nthose who pain their bodies by being shot with arrows and who allow their\ncarcasses being devoured by the crows and jackals, then no man, even of dull\nunderstanding, will like this, what to speak of intelligent persons!\nTherefore, O V _r_ itra! Let everlasting peace and friendship be established\nbetween you and Indra; both of you in that case will derive everlasting peace\nand happiness. Moreover if the enmity between you terminates from this\ninstant, then we, the ascetics and Gandharbas will, no doubt, be able to\nremain in our own respective \xc3\x82s'rams with great comfort. O Powerful Hero!\nOwing to incessant wars between you and Indra, the Munis, Gandharbas, Kinnaras\nand beings are day and night, suffering very much. For the happiness of all\npeace-loving persons, we, the Munis, the residents of the forest, earnestly\ndesire that there be formed friendship between you two. We desire that you,\nIndra and all the Jivas get happiness. O V _r_ itra! We stand as mediators in\nthis treaty between you and Indra; we will make each party swear on oath and\nthus make it conducive to the happiness of both. Indra will now swear on oath\nbefore you on the terms that you will dictate and thus will make your heart\ncheerful. Know this verily that this earth stands on Truth, the sun rises for\nthe sake of Truth, the winds blow all along for Truth and the boundless ocean\nnever oversteps its limit for Truth. Therefore let your friendship, be\nestablished on Truth. Thus tied together by bonds of friendship let you two\nsleep, play, make sports in water and sit together happily.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\np. 501\n\n\n\n24-28. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing the Mahar _s_ i's words, the highly\nintelligent V _r_ itra began to say :-- \xc2\x93Risis! You are possessed with\nknowledge and many other qualifications and you are ascetics; you are\ntherefore to be respected by me. You are the Munis and therefore you never\nspeak anywhere falsehood; your conduct is good and you practise rite and\nceremonies; you are calm; therefore you do not know the causes of pretexts.\nThe intelligent should never cultivate friendship with a knave, licentious\nperson who is void of understanding, an infamous, and a shameless person,\nspecially if he be an enemy. This vicious Indra is shameless, deceitful,\nlicentious, and the killer of a Brahma _n_ a; therefore no faith can ever be\nplaced on such persons. You are saints and added with all good qualifications;\ntherefore your minds never play in the mischievous thoughts of others; it is\nbecause your heart is calm and quiet that you cannot understand the minds of\nthe deceitful and treacherous; therefore you ought never to stand as mediators\nbetween any two persons.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n29-32. The Munis said :-- \xc2\x93O King! All the creatures certainly enjoy the\nfruits of their Karmas, whether good or bad; how then, can persons, of\nperverted intellect, obtain peace when they do mischief to others. The\ntreacherous persons certainly go to hell and suffer miseries always. The\nslayers of Brahma _n_ as and the drunkards may get liberation; but never the\nfaithless and those who go against their friends get off free; these will have\nto suffer undoubtedly in the hells. Therefore, O Knower of all things! Give\nout clearly what is going on exactly in your mind and the exact terms that you\nwant; and the treaty will be made between you and Indra exactly according to\nthose terms.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n33-34. V _r_ itra said :-- \xc2\x93O highly fortunate Munis! I can enter into a\ntreaty of peace with Indra only on the condition that Indra with all the other\nDevas will not kill me in day or in night with any dry or liquid substance or\nwith wood, stone, or thunderbolt and on no other terms.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n35-68. Vyasa said :-- O King! The Ri _s_ is then gladly accepted his word and\nbrought Indra there and recited to him the terms of the treaty of peace.\nIndra, then, swore, an oath, before the Munis with Fire as the Witness that he\nwould comply with the terms of the treaty, and was thus freed from his heavy\nthoughts and felt that he had been rid of a fever. V _r_ itra, then, relied on\nlndra's words; became his friend, and began live, play and enjoy with him.\nThey felt pleasure by their union and began to roam sometimes in the Nandana\nGarden, sometimes in the Gandha Madana, sometimes on the shores of oceans, V\n_r_ itra was very much delighted when they were thus united in friendship; but\nIndra watched\n\n\n\np. 502\n\n\n\nhim to find his faults; thus sometime passed. A few years passed away after\nthe treaty had been concluded. And the straight-forward V _r_ itra began to\nplace very much confidence on Indra; but Indra meditated on the means how to\nkill him. One day Visvakarma, knowing that his son V _r_ itrasura placed\nimplicit confidence on Indra, called his son and said :-- \xc2\x93O my son V _r_\nitra! Hear my good words. See, it is never advisable to trust anybody with\nwhom there has arisen once the enmity. Indra is your greatest enemy; he always\nintends evil to you; therefore do not trust him any more. Indra is never to be\ntrusted, who is always covetous, inimical, rejoicing at others sufferings,\nlicentious and addicted to others' wives; vicious, deceitful, finding faults\nwith others, always jealous, a juggler, and puffed up with vanity. O Child!\nWhat more shall I say than this fact that that villain, without fearing sin,\neasily entered into the womb of his mother and cut the crying child in the\nwomb into seven pieces and then each seventh part again into seven parts, thus\naltogether into forty-nine parts. Therefore O my son! He is never to be\ntrusted on any account. He who is always addicted to vicious deeds never feels\nshame in perpetrating again another crime.\xc2\x94 Vyasa said :-- O King! V _r_\nitra's death time drew nigh; hence he could not take his father's words as\nauspicious, though he was warned by his father in words full of meaning. One\nday, in the evening time, at a very inauspicious dreadful moment, Indra saw V\n_r_ itra on the shore of an ocean and began to think of the boon granted by\nBrahma to the Asura thus :-- \xc2\x93Now this is the terrible evening time; this\ncannot be called day nor can it be called night, and this demon is also here\nalone in this solitary place; it is advisable therefore to effect his death by\nforce, there is no doubt in this.\xc2\x94 Thus arguing in his mind, Indra remembered\nthe Undecaying Soul Hari. Bhagavan, the Best of Puru _s_ as came there, unseen\nby anybody, and entered into the thunderbolt; Indra quickly collected himself\nto kill V _r_ itrasura; but he thought how he could slay this Demon,\nunconquerable in the battle; and if he did not slay his enemy then by deceit,\nthen his enemy would continue to live, and it would be impossible for him to\nget his own welfare. While he was thus thinking, he saw the foam of the waters\nof the ocean as big as a mountain; thinking that foam not to be dry nor wet\nand considering that foam not to be any weapon, he easily took that foam and\ninstantly remembered with a heartful devotion the Highest Force Bhuvanes'vari.\nOn Her remembrance, the Bhagavati infused Her part into that foam and the\nthunderbolt, instilled with the force of Narayana, was covered, too, by that\nfoam. Indra, then, hurled the thunderbolt covered with foam on V _r_ itra; and\nthe Demon, thus struck, instantly fell down like a mountain. When V _r_\nitrasura was thus killed, Indra became very glad; the Ri _s_ is began to\npraise\n\n\n\np. 503\n\n\n\nhim with various hymns. Indra, then, with all the other Devas worshipped the\nDevi, through Whose Grace the enemy had been killed and they praised Her with\nvarious hymns. The image of the Bhagavati the Supreme S'akti was built of ruby\nand installed in the Nandana Garden. O King! Since then all the Devas used to\nworship the Devi thrice a day, morning, midday and evening and since then the\nS'ri Devi became the tutelary deity of the Gods. Indra worshipped then Vi _sn_\nu also, the Highest of the Gods. When the terrible powerful V _r_ itrasura was\nkilled, the auspicious wind began to blow gently; the Devas, Gandharbas,\nRakhsasas, and Kinnaras began to roam about with great joy. V _r_ itrasura was\ndeluded by the Maya of Bhagavati, and Her force entered into the foam; hence\nIndra was capable to kill him suddenly and it is, for this reason, that the\nDevi, the Goddess of the world, is known in the three worlds as \xc2\x93V _r_\nitranihantri,\xc2\x94 the slayer of V _r_ itra. But at the first sight Indra killed\nhim by means of the foam; hence the people say that V _r_ itra was killed by\nIndra.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Sixth Chapter of the Sixth Book on the slaying of V _r_ itrasura\nin the Mahapura _n_ am S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_\ni Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 7](bk06ch07.htm)\n\n"
