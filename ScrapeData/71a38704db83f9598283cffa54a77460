Charm against the poison of serpents, scorpions, and insects.\n\n1\\. The poison infused by the serpent that is striped across, by the black\nserpent, and by the adder; that poison of the kankaparvan ('with limbs like a\ncomb,' scorpion) this plant has driven out.  \n2\\. This herb, born of honey, dripping honey, sweet as honey, honied, is the\nremedy for injuries; moreover it crushes insects.  \n3\\. Wherever thou hast been bitten, wherever thou hast been sucked, from there\ndo we exorcise for thee the poison of the small, greedily biting insect, (so\nthat it be) devoid of strength.  \n4\\. Thou (serpent) here, crooked, without joints, and without limbs, that\ntwisteth thy crooked jawsmayest thou, O Brihaspati, straighten them out, as  \na (bent) reed!  \n5\\. The poison of the sarkota (scorpion) that creeps low upon the ground,\n(after he) has been deprived of his strength, I have taken away; moreover I\nhave caused him to be crushed.  \n6\\. There is no strength in thy arms, in thy head, nor in the middle (of thy\nbody). Then why dost thou so wickedly carry a small (sting) in thy tail?  \n7\\. The ants devour thee, pea-hens hack thee to pieces. Yea, every one of you\nshall declare the poison of the sarkota powerless!  \n8\\. Thou (scorpion) that strikest with both, with mouth as well as tail, in\nthy mouth there is no poison: then what can there be in the receptacle in thy\ntail?\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 16.
