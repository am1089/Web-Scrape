The birth with Asuras  \nBrings into bondage. Be thou joyous, Prince!  \nWhose lot is set apart for heavenly Birth.\n\nTwo stamps there are marked on all living men,  \nDivine and Undivine; I spake to thee  \nBy what marks thou shouldst know the Heavenly Man,  \nHear from me now of the Unheavenly!\n\nThey comprehend not, the Unheavenly,  \nHow Souls go forth from Me; nor how they come  \nBack unto Me: nor is there Truth in these,  \nNor purity, nor rule of Life. "This world  \nHath not a Law, nor Order, nor a Lord,"  \nSo say they: "nor hath risen up by Cause  \nFollowing on Cause, in perfect purposing,  \nBut is none other than a House of Lust."  \nAnd, this thing thinking, all those ruined ones-  \nOf little wit, dark-minded- give themselves  \nTo evil deeds, the curses of their kind.  \nSurrendered to desires insatiable,  \nFull of deceitfulness, folly, and pride,  \nIn blindness cleaving to their errors, caught  \nInto the sinful course, they trust this lie  \nAs it were true- this lie which leads to death-  \nFinding in Pleasure all the good which is,  \nAnd crying "Here it finisheth!"\n\nEnsnared  \nIn nooses of a hundred idle hopes,  \nSlaves to their passion and their wrath, they buy  \nWealth with base deeds, to glut hot appetites;  \n"Thus much, to-day," they say, "we gained! thereby  \nSuch and such wish of heart shall have its fill;  \nAnd this is ours! and th\' other shall be ours!  \nTo-day we slew a foe, and we will slay  \nOur other enemy to-morrow! Look!  \nAre we not lords? Make we not goodly cheer?  \nIs not our fortune famous, brave, and great?  \nRich are we, proudly born! What other men  \nLive like to us? Kill, then, for sacrifice!  \nCast largesse, and be merry!" So they speak  \nDarkened by ignorance; and so they fall-  \nTossed to and fro with projects, tricked, and bound  \nIn net of black delusion, lost in lusts-  \nDown to foul Naraka. Conceited, fond,  \nStubborn and proud, dead-drunken with the wine  \nOf wealth, and reckless, all their offerings  \nHave but a show of reverence, being not made  \nIn piety of ancient faith. Thus vowed  \nTo self-hood, force, insolence, feasting, wrath,  \nThese My blasphemers, in the forms they wear  \nAnd in the forms they breed, my foemen are,  \nHateful and hating; cruel, evil, vile,  \nLowest and least of men, whom I cast down  \nAgain, and yet again, at end of lives,  \nInto some devilish womb, whence- birth by birth-  \nThe devilish wombs re-spawn them, all beguiled;  \nAnd, till they find and worship Me, sweet Prince!  \nTread they that Nether Road.\n\nThe Doors of Hell  \nAre threefold, whereby men to ruin pass,-  \nThe door of Lust, the door of Wrath, the door  \nOf Avarice. Let a man shun those three!  \nHe who shall turn aside from entering  \nAll those three gates of Narak, wendeth straight  \nTo find his peace, and comes to Swarga\'s gate.\n\nHERE ENDETH CHAPTER XVI OF THE  \nBHAGAVAD-GITA,  \nEntitled "Daivasarasaupadwibhagayog,"  \nOr "The Book of the Separateness of the  \nDivine and Undivine."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 17: Of Religion by the Threefold Kinds of Faith](bg17.htm)\n\n'
