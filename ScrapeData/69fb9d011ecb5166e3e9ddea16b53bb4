Truly, Nund and Jusodha must at some time have performed a great\npenance, for which reason (or in consequence of which) Bhugwan has been born\nin their house." And the cowherds\' children having come and embraced Krishnu,\nasked him, "Brother! how did you support the weight of such a huge hill on\nyour soft lotus-like hand?"\n\nAnd Nund and Jusodha, clasping their son with tenderness to their bosoms,\nrubbing his hand, and making his finger crack, began to say to him, "You\nplaced the hill for seven days on your hand; it must now be painful."\n\nAnd the cowherdesses came to Jusodha, and having mentioned to her all the\nsports which Krishnu had last been engaged in, said, "May this child, your\nson, live a very long time, the guardian of Bruj. He has destroyed demons,\ngiants and evil spirits. Where are the limits to his liberation of the\ninhabitants of Bruj. Every thing has happened, exactly as Rae Gurug, the sage,\nsaid.\'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXVIII](psa29.htm)\n\n'
