Now the\nmetres are cattle, and the middle-most layer is the air: he thus places cattle\nin the air, whence cattle have their abode in the air.\n\np. 52\n\n8:3:3:22\\. And, again, as to why he lays down _Kh_ andasyas,--the metres are\ncattle, and cattle are food, and the middlemost layer is the middle (of Agni,\nthe altar): he thus places food in the middle (of Agni's body).\n\n8:3:3:33\\. He lays them down by twelves,--for the _G_ agati consists of twelve\nsyllables, and the _G_ agati is cattle, and the middlemost layer is the air:\nhe thus places cattle in the air, whence cattle have their abode in the air.\n\n8:3:3:44\\. And, again, why (he lays them down) by twelves,--the _G_ agati\nconsists of twelve syllables, and the _G_ agati is cattle, and cattle is food,\nand the middlemost layer is the middle: he thus places food in the middle. He\nplaces them so as not to be separated from the Pra _n_ abh _ri_ ts: he thus\nplaces the food so as not to be separated from the vital airs subsequently (to\nthem he places them): he thus bestows food after (bestowing) the vital airs.\n\n8:3:3:55\\. [He lays down the right set, with, Va _g_. S. XIV, 18], 'The metre\nMeasure;'--the measure (ma), doubtless, is this (terrestrial) world, for this\nworld is, as it were, measured (mita);--'the metre Fore-measure!'--the fore-\nmeasure (prama), doubtless, is the air-world, for the air-world is, as it\nwere, measured forward from this world;--'The metre Countermeasure,'--the\ncounter-measure (pratima), doubtless, is yonder (heavenly) world, for yonder\nworld is, as it were, counter-measured 1 in the air;--'The metre\nAsrivayas,'--'asrivayas,' doubtless, is food: whatever food there is in these\nworlds that is 'asrivayas.' Or, whatever food (anna) flows (sravati) from\nthese\n\np. 53\n\nworlds that is 'asrivayas.' Hereafter, now, he puts down only defined metres.\n\n8:3:3:66\\. 'The Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti metre! the Ush _n_ ih metre! the B _ri_ hati metre! the\nAnush _t_ ubh metre! the Vira _g_ metre! the Gayatri metre! the Trish _t_ ubh\nmetre! the _G_ agati metre!' these eight defined metres, including the Vira\n_g_ , he puts down.--[The back set, with, Va _g_. S. XIV, 19], 'The metre\nEarth! the metre Air! the metre Heaven! the metre Years! the metre Stars! the\nmetre Speech! the metre Mind! the metre Husbandry! the metre Gold! the metre\nCow! the metre Goat! the metre Horse!' he thus puts down those metres which\nare sacred to those particular deities.--[The left set, with, Va _g_. S. XIV,\n20], 'The deity Fire! the deity Wind! the deity Sun! the deity Moon! the deity\nVasava _h_! the deity Rudra _h_! the deity \xc3\x82ditya _h_! the deity Maruta _h_!\nthe deity Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_! the deity B _ri_ haspati! the deity Indra! the\ndeity Varu _n_ a!'--these deities, doubtless, are metres: it is these he thus\nlays down.\n\n8:3:3:77\\. He lays down both defined and undefined (metres). Were he to lay\ndown such as are all defined, then the food would have an end, it would fail;\nand (were he to lay down) such as are all undefined, then the food would be\ninvisible, and one would not see it at all. He lays down both defined and\nundefined ones: hence the defined (certain) food which is eaten does not fail.\n\n8:3:3:88\\. These then are those (sets of) twelve he lays down,--that makes\nthirty-six, and the B _ri_ hati consists of thirty-six syllables: this is that\nsame B _ri_ hati, the air, which the gods then saw as a third\n\np. 54\n\nlayer. In that (b _ri_ hati set of bricks) the gods come last (or, are\nhighest).\n\n8:3:3:99\\. And, again, as to why he lays down these bricks. When Pra _g_ apati\nbecame relaxed, all living beings went from him in all directions.\n\n8:3:3:1010\\. Now that same Pra _g_ apati who became relaxed is this very Agni\n(fire-altar) that is now being built up; and those living beings which went\nfrom him are these bricks: hence when he lays down these (bricks), he thereby\nputs back into him (Pra _g_ apati-Agni) those same living beings which went\nfrom him.\n\n8:3:3:1111\\. Now when he first lays down ten (Pra _n_ abh _ri_ ts), they are\nthe moon. There are ten of these,--the Vira _g_ ; consists of ten syllables,\nand the Vira _g_ is food, and the moon is food. And when subsequently he lays\ndown thirty-six ( _Kh_ andasyas), they are the half-months and months--twenty-\nfour half-months and twelve months: the moon, doubtless, is the year, and all\nliving beings.\n\n8:3:3:1212\\. And when the gods restored him (Pra _g_ apati-Agni), they put all\nthose living beings inside him, and in like manner does this one now put them\ntherein. He lays them down so as not to be separated from the seasonal\n(bricks): he thus establishes all living beings in the seasons.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[51:2](sbe4313.htm#fr_121) The thirty-six _Kh_ andasya bricks are laid down,\nin three sets of twelve each, along the edge of the body of the altar where\nthe two wings and the tail join it; six bricks being placed on each side of\nthe respective spine. At the back the bricks are not, however, placed close to\nthe edge separating the body from the tail, but sufficient space is left (a\nfoot wide) for another set of bricks to be laid down behind the _Kh_ andasyas.\n\n[52:1](sbe4313.htm#fr_122) That is, made a counterfeit, or copy, of the earth.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 3, 4.
