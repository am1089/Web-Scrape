Awaken [1](sbe46118.htm#an_5:14:1:1) Agni by thy song of praise, kindling\n(him) the immortal one. May he place our offerings among the gods.\n\n2\\. Him, the immortal god, the mortals magnify at their sacrifices, the best\nsacrificer among the tribe of men.\n\n3\\. Him indeed they all magnify, the god, with the (sacrificial) ladle that\noverflows with gh _ri_ ta, Agni, in order that he may bear the oblation.\n\n4\\. Agni when born has shone, killing the Dasyus, (killing) darkness by light.\nHe has found the cows, the waters, the sun [1](sbe46118.htm#an_5:14:4:1).\n\n5\\. Worship Agni, the sage who should be magnified, whose back is covered with\ngh _ri_ ta. May he come and hear my call [1](sbe46118.htm#an_5:14:5:1).\n\n6\\. They have made Agni grow by gh _ri_ ta, him who dwells among all tribes,\nand by longing, eloquent praises.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi and metre.--Verse 1 = TS. IV, 1, 11, 4; MS. IV, 10, 1; VS.\nXXII, 15. Verse 3 = TS. IV, 3, 13, 8; MS. IV, 10, 1. Verse 4 = MS. IV, 10, 2.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. We have no reason and, unless we write bodhaya, no right for taking\nbodhaya as an equivalent of bodhayani (Ludwig).\n\np. 398\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Agni is considered here, as is done frequently, as the performer of\ndeeds which properly belong to Indra (see H. O., Religion des Veda, 98 seq.).\nIndra is the conqueror of the cows and of the waters; as to the sun, it may be\nsaid of both gods with the same right that they have acquired it for mankind\n(Religion des Veda, 110 seq.; 150 seq.).\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Although me can be accusative (Pischel, Zeitschrift der Deutschen\nMorgenlandischen Gesellschaft, XXXV, 714 seq.), I have no doubt that it is\nhere genitive, and depends on havam. Cf. II, 24, 15. veshi me havam; X, 61, 4.\nvitam me ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ am.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 15](sbe46119.htm)\n\n'
