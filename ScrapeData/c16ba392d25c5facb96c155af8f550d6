We admit that release\nconsists only in the cessation of Nescience, and that this cessation results\nentirely from the knowledge of Brahman. But a distinction has here to be made\nregarding the nature of this knowledge which\n\np. 12\n\nthe Vedanta-texts aim at enjoining for the purpose of putting an end to\nNescience. Is it merely the knowledge of the sense of sentences which\noriginates from the sentences? or is it knowledge in the form of meditation\n(upasana) which has the knowledge just referred to as its antecedent? It\ncannot be knowledge of the former kind: for such knowledge springs from the\nmere apprehension of the sentence, apart from any special injunction, and\nmoreover we do not observe that the cessation of Nescience is effected by such\nknowledge merely. Our adversary will perhaps attempt to explain things in the\nfollowing way. The Vedanta-texts do not, he will say, produce that knowledge\nwhich makes an end of Nescience, so long as the imagination of plurality is\nnot dispelled. And the fact that such knowledge, even when produced, does not\nat once and for every one put a stop to the view of plurality by no means\nsubverts my opinion; for, to mention an analogous instance, the double\nappearance of the moon--presenting itself to a person affected with a certain\nweakness of vision--does not come to an end as soon as the oneness of the moon\nhas been apprehended by reason. Moreover, even without having come to an end,\nthe view of plurality is powerless to effect further bondage, as soon as the\nroot, i.e. Nescience, has once been cut But this defence we are unable to\nadmit. It is impossible that knowledge should not arise when its means, i.e.\nthe texts conveying knowledge, are once present. And we observe that even when\nthere exists an antagonistic imagination (interfering with the rise of\nknowledge), information given by competent persons, the presence of\ncharacteristic marks (on which a correct inference may be based), and the like\ngive rise to knowledge which sublates the erroneous imagination. Nor can we\nadmit that even after the sense of texts has been apprehended, the view of\nplurality may continue owing to some small remainder of beginningless\nimagination. For as this imagination which constitutes the means for the view\nof plurality is itself false, it is necessarily put an end to by the rise of\ntrue knowledge. If this did not take place, that imagination would never come\nto an end, since there is no\n\np. 13\n\nother means but knowledge to effect its cessation. To say that the view of\nplurality, which is the effect of that imagination, continues even after its\nroot has been cut, is mere nonsense. The instance of some one seeing the moon\ndouble is not analogous. For in his case the non-cessation of wrong knowledge\nexplains itself from the circumstance that the cause of wrong knowledge, viz.\nthe real defect of the eye which does not admit of being sublated by\nknowledge, is not removed, although that which would sublate wrong knowledge\nis near. On the other hand, effects, such as fear and the like, may come to an\nend because they can be sublated by means of knowledge of superior force.\nMoreover, if it were true that knowledge arises through the dispelling of the\nimagination of plurality, the rise of knowledge would really never be brought\nabout. For the imagination of plurality has through gradual growth in the\ncourse of beginningless time acquired an infinite strength, and does not\ntherefore admit of being dispelled by the comparatively weak conception of\nnon-duality. Hence we conclude that the knowledge which the Vedanta-texts aim\nat inculcating is a knowledge other than the mere knowledge of the sense of\nsentences, and denoted by \'dhyana,\' \'upasana\' (i. e. meditation), and similar\nterms.\n\nWith this agree scriptural texts such as \'Having known it, let him practise\nmeditation\' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 21); \'He who, having searched out the Self,\nknows it\' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 7, 1); \'Meditate on the Self as Om\' (Mu. Up. II,\n2, 6); \'Having known that, he is freed from the jaws of death\' (Ka. Up. I, 3,\n15); \'Let a man meditate on the Self only as his world\' (B _ri_. Up. I, 4,\n15); \'The Self is to be seen, to be heard, to her reflected on, to be\nmeditated on\' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 5, 6); \'That we must search out, that we must\ntry to understand\' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 7, 1).\n\n(According to the principle of the oneness of purport of the different _s_\nakhas) all these texts must be viewed as agreeing in meaning with the\ninjunction of meditation contained in the passage quoted from the B _ri_. Up.;\nand what they enjoin is therefore meditation. In the first and second passages\nquoted, the words \'having known\' and\n\np. 14\n\n[paragraph continues] \'having searched out\' (vi _g \xc3\xb1_aya; anuvidya) contain a\nmere reference to (not injunction of) the apprehension of the meaning of\ntexts, such apprehension subserving meditation; while the injunction of\nmeditation (which is the true purport of the passages) is conveyed by the\nclauses \'let him practise meditation\' (pra _g \xc3\xb1_a _m_ kurvita) and \'he knows\nit.\' In the same way the clause \'the Self is to be heard\' is a mere anuvada,\ni.e. a mere reference to what is already established by other means; for a\nperson who has read the Veda observes that it contains instruction about\nmatters connected with certain definite purposes, and then on his own account\napplies himself to methodical \'hearing,\' in order definitely to ascertain\nthese matters; \'hearing\' thus is established already. In the same way the\nclause \'the Self is to be reflected upon\' is a mere anuvada of reflection\nwhich is known as a means of confirming what one has \'heard.\' It is therefore\nmeditation only which all those texts enjoin. In agreement with this a later\nSutra also says, \'Repetition more than once, on account of instruction\' (Ve.\nSu. IV, I, I). That the knowledge intended to be enjoined as the means of\nfinal release is of the nature of meditation, we conclude from the\ncircumstance that the terms \'knowing\' and\'meditating\' are seen to be used in\nplace of each other in the earlier and later parts of Vedic texts. Compare the\nfollowing passages: \'Let a man meditate on mind as Brahman,\' and \'he who knows\nthis shines and warms through his celebrity, fame, and glory of countenance\' (\n_Kh_. Up. III, 18, 1; 6). And \'He does not know him, for he is not complete,\'\nand \'Let men meditate on him as the Self (B _ri_. Up. I, 4, 7). And \'He who\nknows what he knows,\' and \'Teach me the deity on which you meditate\' ( _Kh_.\nUp. IV, 1,6; 2, 2).\n\n\'Meditation\' means steady remembrance, i.e. a continuity of steady\nremembrance, uninterrupted like the flow of oil; in agreement with the\nscriptural passage which declares steady remembrance to be the means of\nrelease, \'on the attainment of remembrance all the ties are loosened\' ( _Kh_.\nUp. VII, 26, 2). Such remembrance is of\n\np. 15\n\nthe same character (form) as seeing (intuition); for the passage quoted has\nthe same purport as the following one, \'The fetter of the heart is broken, all\ndoubts are solved, and all the works of that man perish when he has been seen\nwho is high and low\' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 8). And this being so, we conclude that\nthe passage \'the Self is to be seen\' teaches that \'Meditation\' has the\ncharacter of \'seeing\' or \'intuition.\' And that remembrance has the character\nof \'seeing\' is due to the element of imagination (representation) which\nprevails in it. All this has been set forth at length by the Vakyakara.\n\'Knowledge (vedana) means meditation (upasana), scripture using the word in\nthat sense\'; i.e. in all Upanishads that knowledge which is enjoined as the\nmeans of final release is Meditation. The Vakyakara then propounds a\npurvapaksha (prima facie view), \'Once he is to make the meditation, the matter\nenjoined by scripture being accomplished thereby, as in the case of the praya\n_g_ as and the like\'; and then sums up against this in the words \'but\n(meditation) is established on account of the term meditation\'; that means--\nknowledge repeated more than once (i.e. meditation) is determined to be the\nmeans of Release.--The Vakyakara then goes on \'Meditation is steady\nremembrance, on the ground of observation and statement.\' That means--this\nknowledge, of the form of meditation, and repeated more than once, is of the\nnature of steady remembrance.\n\nSuch remembrance has been declared to be of the character of \'seeing,\' and\nthis character of seeing consists in its possessing the character of immediate\npresentation (pratyakshata). With reference to remembrance, which thus\nacquires the character of immediate presentation and is the means of final\nrelease, scripture makes a further determination, viz. in the passage Ka. Up.\nI, 2, 23, \'That Self cannot be gained by the study of the Veda ("reflection"),\nnor by thought ("meditation"), nor by much hearing. Whom the Self chooses, by\nhim it may be gained; to him the Self reveals its being.\' This text says at\nfirst that mere hearing, reflection, and meditation do not suffice to gain the\nSelf, and then declares, \'Whom the Self chooses, by him\n\np. 16\n\nit may be gained.\' Now a \'chosen\' one means a most beloved person; the\nrelation being that he by whom that Self is held most dear is most dear to the\nSelf. That the Lord (bhagavan) himself endeavours that this most beloved\nperson should gain the Self, he himself declares in the following words, \'To\nthose who are constantly devoted and worship with love I give that knowledge\nby which they reach me\' (Bha. Gi. X, 10), and \'To him who has knowledge I am\ndear above all things, and he is dear to me\' (VII, 17). Hence, he who\npossesses remembrance, marked by the character of immediate presentation\n(sakshatkara), and which itself is dear above all things since the object\nremembered is such; he, we say, is chosen by the highest Self, and by him the\nhighest Self is gained. Steady remembrance of this kind is designated by the\nword \'devotion\' (bhakti); for this term has the same meaning as upasana\n(meditation). For this reason scripture and sm _ri_ ti agree in making the\nfollowing declarations, \'A man knowing him passes over death\' ( _S_ vet. Up.\nIII, 8); \'Knowing him thus he here becomes immortal\' (Taitt. \xc3\x82r. III, 12,7);\n\'Neither by the Vedas, nor by austerities, nor by gifts, nor by sacrifice can\nI be so seen as thou hast seen me. But by devotion exclusive I may in this\nform be known and seen in truth, O Ar _g_ una, and also be entered into\' (Bha.\nGi. XI, 53, 54); \'That highest Person, O Partha, may be obtained by exclusive\ndevotion\' (VIII, 22).\n\nThat of such steady remembrance sacrifices and so on are means will be\ndeclared later on (Ve. Su. III, 4, 26). Although sacrifices and the like are\nenjoined with a view to the origination of knowledge (in accordance with the\npassage \'They desire to know,\' B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 22), it is only knowledge in\nthe form of meditation which--being daily practised, constantly improved by\nrepetition, and continued up to death--is the means of reaching Brahman, and\nhence all the works connected with the different conditions of life are to be\nperformed throughout life only for the purpose of originating such knowledge.\nThis the Sutrakara declares in Ve. Su. IV, 1, 12; 16; III, 4, 33, and other\nplaces. The Vakyakara also declares that\n\np. 17\n\nsteady remembrance results only from abstention, and so on; his words being\n\'This (viz. steady remembrance= meditation) is obtained through abstention\n(viveka), freeness of mind (vimoka), repetition (abhyasa), works (kriya),\nvirtuous conduct (kalya _n_ a), freedom from dejection (anavasada), absence of\nexultation (anuddharsha); according to feasibility and scriptural statement.\'\nThe Vakyakara also gives definitions of all these terms. Abstention (viveka)\nmeans keeping the body clean from all food, impure either owing to species\n(such as the flesh of certain animals), or abode (such as food belonging to a\n_K_ a _nd_ ala or the like), or accidental cause (such as food into which a\nhair or the like has fallen). The scriptural passage authorising this point is\n_Kh._ Up. VII, 26, \'The food being pure, the mind becomes pure; the mind being\npure, there results steady remembrance.\' Freeness of mind (vimoka) means\nabsence of attachment to desires. The authoritative passage here is \'Let him\nmeditate with a calm mind\' ( _Kh._ Up. III, 14, 1). Repetition means continued\npractice. For this point the Bhashya-kara quotes an authoritative text from Sm\n_ri_ ti, viz.: \'Having constantly been absorbed in the thought of that being\'\n(sada tadbhavabhavita _h_ ; Bha. Gi.VIII, 6).--By \'works\' (kriya) is\nunderstood the performance, according to one\'s ability, of the five great\nsacrifices. The authoritative passages here are \'This person who performs\nworks is the best of those who know Brahman\' (Mu. Up. III, 1, 4); and \'Him\nBrahma _n_ as seek to know by recitation of the Veda, by sacrifice, by gifts,\nby penance, by fasting\' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 22).--By virtuous conduct (kalya\n_n_ ani) are meant truthfulness, honesty, kindness, liberality, gentleness,\nabsence of covetousness. Confirmatory texts are \'By truth he is to be\nobtained\' (Mu. Up. III, 1, 5) and \'to them belongs that pure Brahman-world\'\n(Pr. Up. I, 16).--That lowness of spirit or want of cheerfulness which results\nfrom unfavourable conditions of place or time and the remembrance of causes of\nsorrow, is denoted by the term \'dejection\'; the contrary of this is \'freedom\nfrom dejection.\' The relevant scriptural passage is \'This Self cannot be\nobtained by one lacking in strength\' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 4).\n\np. 18\n\n[paragraph continues] \\--\'Exultation\' is that satisfaction of mind which\nsprings from circumstances opposite to those just mentioned; the contrary is\n\'absence of exultation.\' Overgreat satisfaction also stands in the way (of\nmeditation). The scriptural passage for this is \'Calm, subdued,\' &c. (B _ri_.\nUp. IV, 4, 23).--What the Vakyakara means to say is therefore that knowledge\nis realised only through the performance of the duly prescribed works, on the\npart of a person fulfilling all the enumerated conditions.\n\nAnalogously another scriptural passage says \'He who knows both knowledge and\nnon-knowledge together, overcoming death by non-knowledge reaches the Immortal\nthrough knowledge\' (\xc3\x8es. Up. II). Here the term \'non-knowledge\' denotes the\nworks enjoined on the different castes and a _s_ ramas; and the meaning of the\ntext is that, having discarded by such works death, i.e. the previous works\nantagonistic to the origination of knowledge, a man reaches the Immortal, i.e.\nBrahman, through knowledge. The non-knowledge of which this passage speaks as\nbeing the means of overcoming death can only mean that which is other than\nknowledge, viz. prescribed works. The word has the same sense in the following\npassage: \'Firm in traditional knowledge he offered many sacrifices, leaning on\nthe knowledge of Brahman, so as to pass beyond death by non-knowledge\' (Vi.\nPu. VI, 6, l2).--Antagonistic to knowledge (as said above) are all good and\nevil actions, and hence--as equally giving rise to an undesirable result--they\nmay both be designated as evil. They stand in the way of the origination of\nknowledge in so far as they strengthen the elements of passion and darkness\nwhich are antagonistic to the element of goodness which is the cause of the\nrise of knowledge. That evil works stand in the way of such origination, the\nfollowing scriptural text declares: \'He makes him whom he wishes to lead down\nfrom these worlds do an evil deed\' (Ka. Up. III, 8). That passion and darkness\nveil the knowledge of truth while goodness on the other hand gives rise to it,\nthe Divine one has declared himself, in the passage \'From goodness springs\nknowledge\' (Bha. Gi. XIV, 17). Hence, in order that\n\np. 19\n\nknowledge may arise, evil works have to be got rid of, and this is effected by\nthe performance of acts of religious duty not aiming at some immediate result\n(such as the heavenly world and the like); according to the text \'by works of\nreligious duty he discards all evil.\' Knowledge which is the means of reaching\nBrahman, thus requires the works prescribed for the different a _s_ ramas; and\nhence the systematic enquiry into works (i. e. the Purva Mima _m_ sa)--from\nwhich we ascertain the nature of the works required and also the\ntransitoriness and limitation of the fruits of mere works--forms a necessary\nantecedent to the systematic enquiry into Brahman. Moreover the discrimination\nof permanent and non-permanent things, &c. (i.e. the tetrad of \'means\'\nmentioned above, p. 11) cannot be accomplished without the study of the Mima\n_m_ sa; for unless we ascertain all the distinctions of fruits of works,\nmeans, modes of procedure and qualification (on the part of the agent) we can\nhardly understand the true nature of works, their fruits, the transitoriness\nor non-transitoriness of the latter, the permanence of the Self, and similar\nmatters. That those conditions (viz. nityanityavastuviveka, _s_ ama, dama,\n&c.) are \'means\' must be determined on the basis of viniyoga (\'application\'\nwhich determines the relation of principal and subordinate matters--a _n_ gin\nand a _n_ ga); and this viniyoga which depends on direct scriptural statement\n( _s_ ruti), inferential signs (li _n_ ga), and so on, is treated of in the\nthird book of the Purva Mima _m_ sa-sutras. And further we must, in this\nconnexion, consider also the meditations on the Udgitha and similar things--\nwhich, although aiming at the success of works, are of the nature of\nreflections on Brahman (which is viewed in them under various forms)--and as\nsuch have reference to knowledge of Brahman. Those works also (with which\nthese meditations are connected) aim at no special results of their own, and\nproduce and help to perfect the knowledge of Brahman: they are therefore\nparticularly connected with the enquiry into Brahman. And that these\nmeditations presuppose an understanding of the nature of works is admitted by\nevery one.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Great Purvapaksha](sbe48007.htm)\n\n'
