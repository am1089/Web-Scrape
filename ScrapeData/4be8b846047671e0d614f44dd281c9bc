Vyasa said :-- O King! Narayana, the Lord of Lak _s_ mi, and Knower of\nthe essences of all subjects, seeing the Devas extremely attached to him and\nanxious, spoke to them thus :-- O Suras! Why have you kept silent? Tell me why\nyou have all come, let it be good or bad, tell me; I will try to remove your\nmiseries. The Devas said :-- O Lord! Is there anything unknown to you in this\nTriloki; You know everything; why then art Thou asking us again and again? In\nancient times You in your Dwarf incarnation overspread the three worlds by\nYour three feet and thus bound the King Vali in his own premises and gave over\nthe sovereignty over the Devas to Indra. O All Pervading One! It is You who\ndeluded the Daityas and procured nectar for the Devas, and it is You who sent\nthem to the house of Death. Therefore, O Lord! You are the one and only one\nthat is capable in warding off all the evils that befall on the Devas.\n\n\n\n6-31. Thus hearing the Devas' words, Vi _sn_ u said :-- \xc2\x93O Suras! You need not\nfear; I know one remedy, approved by all, by which that Daitya might be killed\nso that you would be happy. I am now giving out to you. Your welfare, your\nbenefit must be looked at by me whether by the exercise of my intelligence or\nby using my prowess, by wealth pretext or by any other means whatsoever. Four\nmeans, viz., conciliation, gifts, sowing discord, or punishment are mentioned\nby the wise statesmen to be applied to friends and specially to the enemies.\nBrahma was worshipped by V _r_ itra with severe austerities and He granted\nboons and it is due to the influence of that favour that this Asura has become\nindomitable. The more so that Vis'vakarma created him from the sacrificial\nfire; it is through all these causes that the Demon Vritrasura, conqueror of\nthe enemies' stronghold, has grown up so very powerful that he can hardly be\nconquered by any being. O Suras! First peace must be negotiated with him; then\ndeceive him, otherwise the enemy will be very difficult to conquer. First\nentice him and bring him under control; then kill him. Now take the Ri _s_ is\nand Gandharbas with you and go where the powerful enemy V _r_ itrasura is\nresiding and make a treaty with him; thus he will be conquered. Swear on oath\nand accede to the terms he proposes and thus create faith in him; then\ncultivate friendship with him; lastly, when time will come, kill that powerful\nenemy. O Suras! I will also enter, unseen by anybody, into the excellent\nweapon of Indra, his thunderbolt and will help him in due time. Wait till the\nperiod of\n\n\n\np. 496\n\n\n\nhis longevity expires; otherwise his death will never take place. Now go to\nthat Asura, with Gandharbas and Ri _s_ is and cunningly cultivate friendship\nbetween him and Indra, by conciliatory words; when he begins thus to put his\nconfidence, then deceive him. I will enter hiddenly into the strong well\ncovered thunderbolt. When Indra will come to know that the Demon has put\ncomplete faith in him, he will hurl his thunderbolt against him and thus the\nenemy will be killed and not otherwise. O Lord of the Devas! Do not consider\nfor the present the act of treachery that you will commit: take my help and\nkill that wicked Demon with thunderbolt. To practise hypocrisy with an\nhypocrite is not considered a sin; specially no powerful enemy can be killed\nonly by the well known rules applicable to warriors, without any deceit. I\nalso deceived, before, Vali, with my dwarf body and again I deceived all the\nDemons by showing myself as a beautiful woman; therefore to practise deceit\nwith a strong deceitful enemy is never considered a sin. Know this. O Devas!\nNow you all conjointly worship the Devi Bhagavati with Mantras and prayers and\ntake Her shelter; the Yoga Maya, then, will help you. We, too, worship that\nDevi, the Highest Prakriti, the Incarnate of pure Sattva Gu _n_ a, Who grants\nsuccess, bestows us all our desires, Who is Herself the object of desires, and\nWho is never realised by any except by those Yogis, self-controlled pure men.\nIndra, too, will certainly be able to kill his enemy in battle if he worships\nHer; for the Maha Maya, the Creatrix of Delusion, will, when worshipped,\ndelude that Demon. Thus deluded by Her Maya, V _r_ itrasura will easily be\nkilled by him; there is no doubt in this, what more do you want than this that\neverything will be successfully accomplished when the Devi Ambika is\npropitiated and gets well pleased. She regulates the hearts of all and is the\nCause of all causes. Without Her worship no one's desires can be expected to\nbe accomplished. Therefore, O Best of Suras! Worship the Universal Mother, the\nPrakriti Devi with greatest devotion and with greatest purity for the\ndestruction of your enemy. See! In days of yore, I fought for five thousand\nyears, dreadfully with the two Demons Madhu and Kai _t_ abha and then killed\nthem. I worshipped, then, the Maha Maya, the Highest Prakriti; She was thus\npleased and deluded the two Asuras; thus the two powerful Asuras puffed up\nwith vanity were deluded and thus I could kill those terrible Daityas under a\npretext. Therefore, O Suras! You, too, worship that Highest Prakriti with the\ngreatest devotion; She will then surely fulfill your desires.\n\n\n\n32-49. O King! When the intelligent Vi _sn_ u enlightened thus the Devas, they\nwent to the top of the Mount Sumeru, adorned with the Mandara\n\n\n\np. 497\n\n\n\ntrees, and, remaining at a secluded place, recited slowly Her Mantrams and\nthus engaged in asceticism and meditation, began to chant hymns and praise\nthat Universal Mother, the Holder of the world, the Remover of all world\nailings, and the Creatrix, Preservatrix and Destructrix of the world and the\nBestower of all desires to Her devotees. The Devas said :-- \xc2\x93O Devi! Be\ngraciously pleased unto us! O Thou, the Destructrix of the afflictions of the\ndistressed! We have taken refuge unto Thy lotus-feet. We have been defeated by\nV _r_ itrasura in the battle, we are very much oppressed and afflicted. O\nThou, the Highest Reality! O Thou, the Mother of the whole Universe! Protect\nus as a Mother protects her child; we are fallen into this difficulty arising\nfrom our enemies. O Mother! Nothing is hidden from Thy knowledge in the three\nworlds. Why art Thou taking no notice of us, that are being tormented by the\nAsuras! O Mother! Thou createst, preservest, and destroyest the three worlds;\nBrahma, Vi _sn_ u and Mahes\xc2\x92a are created by Thy mere will and are doing all\nThy works. Mother! They are not independent; by the contraction of Thy eye-\nbrows, they are directed and enjoy all the pleasures. The Mother protects her\nsons afflicted with various difficulties and dangers, even when they are found\nguilty of various offences. It is Thou that hast made this rule; then why, O\nMerciful! Art Thou not protecting us who are quite innocent and whom Thou dost\nknow as having taken refuge unto Thy lotus-feet. O Devi! If Thou thinkest that\nwe forget Thee, being too much attracted by the enjoyments that Thou hast been\npleased to confer unto us and therefore we are proper not to be looked upon\nwith Thy merciful eyes, we would say that this is quite true; but, O Mother !\nNowhere is seen a feeling of a Mother to Her child; we are no doubt, objects\nof Thy mercy and favour always. Besides there is no fault of us in this\nmatter, O Mother! that we do not worship Thee and become immersed in sensual\nenjoyments; for Thy creation, the Moha (delusion) is very powerful and deludes\nus. O Mother! Thou art naturally Merciful! Knowing these, why art Thou not\nshowing mercy unto us. O Devi! Thou hadst killed before in battle, for our\nsake, the powerful Daitya Chief Mahis'asura, very terrible to all the beings.\nThen why art not Thou, O Mother ! killing this dreadful V _r_ itrasura? O\nMother! Thou hadst killed the two brother Daityas, S'umbha and Nis'umbha,\nextraordinarily powerful, and the other Daityas that followed them; O Thou,\nthe embodiment of mercy! Similarly destroy now this deceitful strong V _r_\nitrasura. O Mother! Delude this proud Asura so that he could not manifest, in\nthe least, his power. We are very much troubled by the Asuras and overwhelmed\nwith terror from them; Thou savest us; for there is no other in the three\nworlds that can by his own force remove the sorrows and sufferings of the\nDevas. O\n\n\n\n\n\nMother! Though Thou hast shown favour towards V _r_ itra, now dost kill him\nsoon, whose nature is cruel and tormenting to others. O Bhavani! Better dost\nThou save him from sin by Thy holy arrows. Otherwise that vicious Asura will\nsurely enter into the hideous Hell. It is for his welfare that Thou oughtest\nto kill him. Those that had been before enemies of the Gods, Thou didst purify\nthem by weapons in the battle-field and hadst sent them to the Nandana Garden\nin the Heavens. O Thou, the Mercy personified! Was it not that Thou didst not\nsave them from hell? Then why art not Thou killing this V _r_ itrasura! We\nknow this for certain that the Asura is Thy enemy, not Thy servant; for that\nmischievous soul is giving us trouble. O Mother! How can he be Thy servant and\ndevotee who torments the Devas that are always engaged in worshipping Thy\nlotus feet. O Mother! How can we perform Thy worship? The flowers and other\narticles used in worship all are created by Thee; especially we and the\nMantras, in fact, everything is the manifestation of Thy power. Therefore, O\nBhavani! We worship Thee by laying ourselves prostrate on Thy feet. Be'st Thou\npleased. Those men are blessed that worship with devotion Thy lotus feet for\ncrossing this ocean of world. O Devi! Those Yogins that want final liberation\nand forsake therefore all attachments, vikaras and delusions, even they attain\nsuccess then only when they meditate Thy lotus feet. Those that are great\nSacrificers and know best the essence of the Vedas, even they when they offer\noblations to the sacrifice, utter \xc2\x93Svaha\xc2\x94 that is cheering to the Devas and\n\xc2\x93Svadha\xc2\x94 very consoling to the Pitris; thus they always think of Thee (for\nSvaha and Svadha are Thy names only). O Mother! Thou art the retentive power\nand memory. Thou art the beauty, Thou art the peace, Thou art the Buddhi\n(intellect) well known to clarify men's minds; and Thou art the prosperity and\nwealth of all these three worlds. O Devi! Those that worship Thee, Thou givest\nthem, out of mercy, those wealth in some way or other.\n\n\n\n50-57. Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus worshipped by the Devas, the Devi Bhagavati\nappeared before them in a very beautiful form, thin, adorned with all\nornaments. Her two hands holding a noose, and goad, and the other two hands\nmaking signs to discard all fear and ready to grant boons; Her loins very\nbeautiful, girdled with a gold band with small bells pending and making sweet\ntinkling sounds; Her feet with anklets (ornaments) making sweet sonorous\nsounds with tiny tinkling bells. Her voice was exceedingly sweet and lovely,\nHer forehead was adorned with the crescent of the Moon and on Her head was\nglittering a diadem of jewels, Her lotus-face adorned with sweet soft smiles\nand with Her three beauteous lotus-eyes looking like Indibaras. Her\n\n\n\np. 499\n\n\n\nbody was of a red colour like the Parijata flowers and Her limbs were marked\nwith red sandal-paste. She was dressed in a red attire. The Devi looked well\npleased, like an ocean of infinite mercy, wearing complete dress suited to\nhappy interviews, the Creatrix of all this Cosmos, the Highest, the Knower of\nall, the Directrix of all, and the Great Upholder of all. She looked like an\nembodiment of the Truth of all Vedantas and the Incarnate of ever Existence,\nIntelligence, Bliss, the Maha Devi Bhagavati Bhuvanes'vari. The Devas all\nbowed down before Her standing in front of them. The Mother then spoke :--\n\xc2\x93What business have you got here? Speak to Me.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n58-59. The Devas said :-- \xc2\x93O Bhagavati! V _r_ itrasura is tormenting much the\nDevas; Bewitch him. O Devi! Do such as he can trust the Devas; and impart then\nstrength on our weapons such as he can be killed.\xc2\x94 Vyasa said :-- \xc2\x93O King!\nThat will be done.\xc2\x94 Saying thus, the Devi departed then and there. The Devas\nbecame very glad and returned respectively to their abodes.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fifth Chapter of the Sixth Book on the praising of the Devi by\nthe Devas in S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda\nVyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 6](bk06ch06.htm)\n\n"
