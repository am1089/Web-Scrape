Not (i.e. the abode of heaven, earth, &c. cannot be) that which is\ninferred, (i.e. the pradhana), on account of the terms not denoting it.\n\nWhile there has been shown a special reason in favour of Brahman (being the\nabode), there is no such special reason in favour of anything else. Hence he\n(the sutrakara) says that that which is inferred, i.e. the pradhana assumed by\nthe Sa _n_ khya-sm _ri_ ti, is not to be accepted as the abode of heaven,\nearth, &c.--Why?--On account of the terms not denoting it. For the sacred text\ndoes not contain any term intimating the non-intelligent pradhana, on the\nground of which we might understand the latter to be the general cause or\nabode; while such terms as 'he who perceives all and knows all' (Mu. Up. I, 1,\n9) intimate an intelligent being opposed to the pradhana in nature.--For the\nsame reason the air also cannot be accepted as the abode of heaven, earth, and\nso on.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 4](sbe34073.htm)\n\n"
