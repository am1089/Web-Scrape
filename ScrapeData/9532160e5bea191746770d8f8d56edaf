(They are) the work of the priest, this is the view of Au _d_ ulomi;\nsince for that (i.e. the entire sacrificial work) he is feed.\n\nThe assertion that the meditations on subordinate members of the sacrifice are\nthe work of the sacrificer is unfounded. They rather are the work of the\npriest, as the teacher Au _d_ ulomi thinks. For the priest is rewarded for the\nwork together with its subordinate members; and the meditations on the udgitha\nand so on fall within the performance of the work since they belong to the\nsphere of that to which the person entitled (viz. the lord of the sacrifice)\nis entitled. Hence they are to be carried out by the priests only, the case\nbeing analogous to that of the restrictive rule as to the work to be performed\nby means of the godohana vessel. In agreement herewith scripture declares the\nudgat _ri_ to be the agent in knowledge, in the following passage, 'Him Vaka\nDalbhya knew. He was the udgat _ri_ of the Naimishiya-sacrificers' ( _Kh_. Up.\nI. 2, 13). With reference to the circumstance noted by the purvapakshin that\nscripture states the fruit to belong to the agent, we remark that this makes\nno difference: For with the exception of cases expressly stated the priest\ncannot be connected with the sacrifice since he subserves the purposes (acts\nfor) another (viz. the lord of the sacrifice).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 46](sbe38255.htm)\n\n"
