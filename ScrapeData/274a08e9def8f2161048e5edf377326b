VI.\n\nOf the different hells or divisions of Naraka, below Patala: the crimes\npunished in them respectively: efficacy of expiation: meditation on Vishn\xcc\x81u\nthe most effective expiation.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--I will now, great Muni, give you an account of the hells which are\nsituated beneath the earth and beneath the waters 1, and into which sinners\nare finally sent.\n\nThe names of the different Narakas are as follows: Raurava, \xc5\x9aukara, Rodha,\nTala, Vi\xc5\x9basana, Mahajwala, Taptakumbha, Lavan\xcc\x81a, Vimohana, Rudhirandha,\nVaitarani, Krimi\xc5\x9ba, Krimibhojana, Asipatravana, Krishn\xcc\x81a, Lalabhaksha,\nDarun\xcc\x81a, Puyavaha, Papa, Vahnijwala, Adho\xc5\x9biras, Sandansa, Kalasutra, Tamas,\nAvichi, \xc5\x9awabhojana, Apratisht\xcc\x81ha, and another Avichi 2. These and many other\nfearful hells are the awful provinces of the kingdom of Yama, terrible with\ninstruments of torture and with fire; into which are hurled all those who are\naddicted when alive to sinful practices 3.\n\nThe man who bears false witness through partiality, or who utters any\nfalsehood, is condemned to the Raurava (dreadful) hell. He who causes\nabortion, plunders a town, kills a cow, or strangles a man, goes to the\n\np. 208\n\n[paragraph continues] Rodha hell (or that of obstruction). The murderer of a\nBrahman, stealer of gold, or drinker of wine, goes to the Sukara (swine) hell;\nas does any one who associates with them. The murderer of a man of the second\nor third castes, and one who is guilty of adultery with the wife of his\nspiritual teacher, is sentenced to the Tala (padlock) hell: and one who holds\nincestuous intercourse with a sister, or murders an ambassador, to Taptakumbha\n(or the hell of heated caldrons). The seller of his wife, a gaoler, a\nhorsedealer, and one who deserts his adherents, falls into the Taptaloha (red-\nhot iron) hell. He who commits incest with a daughter-in-law or a daughter is\ncast into the Mahajwala hell (or that of great flame): and he who is\ndisrespectful to his spiritual guide, who is abusive to his betters, who\nreviles the Vedas, or who sells them 4, who associates with women in a\nprohibited degree, into the Lavan\xcc\x81a (salt) hell. A thief and a contemner of\nprescribed observances falls into Vimohana (the place of bewildering). He who\nhates his father, the Brahmans, and the gods, or who spoils precious gems, is\npunished in the Krimibhaksha hell (where worms are his food): and he who\npractises magic rites for the harm of others, in the hell called Krimi\xc5\x9ba (that\nof insects). The vile wretch who eats his meal before offering food to the\ngods, to the manes, or to guests, falls into the hell called Lalabhaksha\n(where saliva is given for food). The maker of arrows is sentenced to the\nVedhaka (piercing) hell: and the maker of lances, swords, and other weapons,\nto the dreadful hell called Vi\xc5\x9basana (murderous). He who takes unlawful gifts\ngoes to the Adhomukha (or head-inverted) hell; as does one who offers\nsacrifices to improper objects, and an observer of the stars (for the\nprediction of events). He who eats by himself sweetmeats mixed with his rice\n5, and a Brahman who vends Lac, flesh, liquors, sesamum, or salt, or one who\ncommits violence, fall into the hell (where matter flows, or) Puyavaha; as do\nthey who rear cats, cocks, goats, dogs, hogs, or birds. Public performers 6,\nfishermen, the follower of one born in adultery, a poisoner,\n\np. 209\n\nan informer, one who lives by his wife's prostitution 7, one who attends to\nsecular affairs on the days of the Parvas (or full and new moon, &c.) 8, an\nincendiary, a treacherous friend, a soothsayer, one who performs religious\nceremonies for rustics, and those who sell the acid Asclepias, used in\nsacrifices, go to the Rudhirandha hell (whose wells are of blood). He who\ndestroys a bee-hive, or pillages a hamlet, is condemned to the Vaitaran\xcc\x81i\nhell. He who causes impotence, trespasses on others' lands, is impure, or who\nlives by fraud, is punished in the hell called (black, or) Krishn\xcc\x81a. He who\nwantonly cuts down trees goes to the Asipatravana hell (the leaves of whose\ntrees are swords): and a tender on sheep, and hunter of deer, to the hell\ntermed Vahnijwala (or fiery flame); as do those who apply fire to unbaked\nvessels (potters). The violator of a vow, and one who breaks the rules of his\norder, falls into the Sandansa (or hell of pincers): and the religious student\nwho sleeps in the day, and is, though unconsciously, defiled; and they who,\nthough mature, are instructed in sacred literature by their children, receive\npunishment in the hell called \xc5\x9awabhojana (where they feed upon dogs). These\nhells, and hundreds and thousands of others, are the places in which sinners\npay the penalty of their crimes. As numerous as are the offences that men\ncommit, so many are the hells in which they are punished: and all who deviate\nfrom the duties imposed upon them by their caste and condition, whether in\nthought, word, or deed, are sentenced to punishment in the regions of the\ndamned 9.\n\nThe gods in heaven are beheld by the inhabitants of hell, as they move with\ntheir heads inverted; whilst the god, as they cast their eyes\n\np. 210\n\ndownwards, behold the sufferings of those in hell 10. The various stages of\nexistence, Maitreya, are inanimate things, fish, birds, animals, men, holy\nmen, gods, and liberated spirits; each in succession a thousand degrees\nsuperior to that which precedes it: and through these stages the beings that\nare either in heaven or in hell are destined to proceed, until final\nemancipation be obtained 11. That sinner goes to Naraka who neglects the due\nexpiation of his guilt.\n\nFor, Maitreya, suitable acts of expiation have been enjoined by the great\nsages for every kind of crime 12. Arduous penances for great sins, trifling\nones for minor offences, have been propounded by Swayambhuva and others: but\nreliance upon Krishn\xcc\x81a is far better than any such expiatory acts, as\nreligious austerity, or the like. Let any one who repents of the sin of which\nhe may have been culpable have recourse to this best of all expiations,\nremembrance of Hari 13: by addressing his thoughts to Narayan\xcc\x81a at dawn, at\nnight, at sunset, and midday, a man shall be quickly cleansed from all guilt:\nthe whole heap of worldly sorrows is dispersed by meditating on Hari; and his\nworshipper, looking upon heavenly fruition as an impediment to felicity,\nobtains final emancipation. He\n\np. 211\n\nwhose mind is devoted to Hari in silent prayer, burnt-offering, or adoration,\nis impatient even of the glory of the king of the gods. Of what avail is\nascent to the summit of heaven, if it is necessary to return from thence to\nearth. How different is the meditation on Vasudeva, which is the seed of\neternal freedom. Hence, Muni, the man who thinks of Vishn\xcc\x81u, day and night,\ngoes not to Naraka after death, for all his sins are atoned for.\n\nHeaven (or Swarga) is that which delights the mind; hell (or Naraka) is that\nwhich gives it pain: hence vice is called hell; virtue is called heaven 14.\nThe selfsame thing is applicable to the production of pleasure or pain, of\nmalice or of anger. Whence then can it be considered as essentially the same\nwith either? That which at one time is a source of enjoyment, becomes at\nanother the cause of suffering; and the same thing may at different seasons\nexcite wrath, or conciliate favour. It follows, then, that nothing is in\nitself either pleasurable or painful; and pleasure and pain, and the like, are\nmerely definitions of various states of mind. That which alone is truth is\nwisdom; but wisdom may be the cause of confinement to existence; for all this\nuniverse is wisdom, there is nothing different from it; and consequently,\nMaitreya, you are to conclude that both knowledge and ignorance are comprised\nin wisdom 15.\n\nI have thus described to you the orb of the earth; the regions below its\nsurface, or Patalas; and the Narakas, or hells; and have briefly enumerated\nits oceans, mountains, continents, regions, and rivers: what else do you wish\nto hear?\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[207:1](vp064.htm#fr_655) The Bhagavata places the Narakas above the waters.\nThe commentator on our text endeavours to reconcile the difference, by\nexplaining the text to imply a dark cavity in which the waters are received,\nnot the original abysses where they were collected at first, and above which\nTartarus lies.\n\n[207:2](vp064.htm#fr_656) Some of these names are the same that are given by\nManu, b. IV. v. 88-90. Kulluka Bhat\xcc\x81t\xcc\x81a refers to the Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya P. for a\ndescription of the twenty-one divisions of hell; but the account there given\nis not more ample than that of our text. The Bhagavata enumerates twenty-\neight, but many of the names differ from the above. In the last instance the\nterm Avichi is either inaccurately repeated, or the adjective Apara is\nintended to distinguish it from the previous Avichi. In Manu, Mahavichi\noccurs.\n\n[207:3](vp064.htm#fr_657) The Padma P. (Kriya Yoga Sara) and the \xc5\x9aiva Dharma,\nwhich appears to be a section of the Skanda P., contain a number of\ninteresting circumstances previous to the infliction of punishment. It appears\nalso from them that Yama fulfils the office of judge of the dead, as well as\nsovereign of the damned; all that die appearing before him, and being\nconfronted with Chitragupta, the recorder, by whom their actions have been\nregistered. The virtuous are thence conveyed to Swarga, or Elysium, whilst the\nwicked are driven to the different regions of Naraka, or Tartarus.\n\n[208:4](vp064.htm#fr_658) 'Who teaches the Vedas for hire.' This notion still\nprevails, and renders the few Pandits who are acquainted with the Vedas very\nunwilling to teach them for a gratuity.\n\n[208:5](vp064.htm#fr_659) 'Thereby,' observes the commentator, 'defrauding or\ndisappointing children.'\n\n[208:6](vp064.htm#fr_660) Rangopajivina: the commentator explains it wrestlers\nand boxers, but Ranga applies to any stage or arena.\n\n[209:7](vp064.htm#fr_661) The term in the text is Mahishika, which might mean\na feeder of buffaloes; but the commentator quotes a text from the Smriti,\nauthorizing the sense above followed.\n\n[209:8](vp064.htm#fr_662) This is the interpretation of Parvakari; it is also\nread Parvagami, he who cohabits with his wife on prohibited days.'\n\n[209:9](vp064.htm#fr_663) An account of Naraka is found in only a few of the\nPuran\xcc\x81as, and in less detail than in the text. The Bhagavata and Vayu have\nsimilar descriptions of them. The Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya enters into detail in some of\nthe instances only. A short account is found in the \xc5\x9aiva, Garura, and Brahma\nVaivartta P. and in the Ka\xc5\x9bi Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a of the Skanda P. The fullest\ndescriptions, however, are those mentioned in a previous note as being in the\n\xc5\x9aiva Dharma of the Skanda, and Kriya Yoga Sara of the Padma; works of a\nsomewhat equivocal character, and belonging rather to Tantra than Pauran\xcc\x81ik\nliterature.\n\n[210:10](vp064.htm#fr_664) The commentator observes that the sight of heavenly\nbliss is given to the damned in order to exacerbate their torments; whilst the\ninflictions of hell are exhibited to the gods to teach them disregard of even\nheavenly enjoyments, as they are but of temporary duration.\n\n[210:11](vp064.htm#fr_665) That is, when punishment or reward in hell or\nheaven, proportioned to the sin or virtue of the individual, has been\nreceived, he must be born again as a stone or plant, and gradually migrate\nthrough the several inferior conditions, until he is once more born a man; his\nfuture state is then in his own power.\n\n[210:12](vp064.htm#fr_666) Manu is here especially intended, as the\ncommentator observes.\n\n[210:13](vp064.htm#fr_667) This remembrance of Vishn\xcc\x81u is the frequent\nreiteration of any or all of his names: hence the lower orders of Hindus\nprocure a starling or parrot, that, in the act of teaching it to cry Rama or\nKrishn\xcc\x81a or Radha, they may themselves repeat these appellations; the simple\nrecitation of which, even if accidentally, irreverently, or reluctantly\nperformed, is meritorious. Thus according to the Vishn\xcc\x81u Disarms Tantra: 'Let\na man ever and every where repeat the names of the discus-armed (Vishn\xcc\x81u); for\nits repetition, even by one who is impure, is a means of purification. Hari\nremoves all sins, even when invoked by evil-minded persons, as fire burns one\nby whom it is unwillingly approached.'\n\n[211:14](vp064.htm#fr_668) The object of the text, according to the\ncommentator, is to shew that the common notions of heaven and hell are\nerroneous; that they are only temporal pleasure and temporal pain; and virtue\nand vice, being the origin of transient, and therefore unreal effects, are\nthemselves unrealities: there is nothing real but faith in Vishn\xcc\x81u.\n\n[211:15](vp064.htm#fr_669) Text and comment are here somewhat obscure; but the\npurport of the former seems to be the explanation of the existence of Jnyan\nwisdom, both as a genus and a species: in the former case it is all that is;\nand in the latter, it may be either true or false wisdom: the latter being\ninfluenced by notions of self or individuality, and therefore the cause of\nconfinement to existence; the former dissipating the belief of self, and being\ntherefore the cause of liberation from bodily being.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VII](vp065.htm)\n\n"
