And,\n\np. 144\n\nverily, such (sacrificers) are seated (sad) in the good 1 (place), for they\nare for ever seated among the good deities; and the others are mere partakers\nin the sacrificial session 2; and if any one were, during a sacrificial\nsession, to speak evil of such initiates as know this, let them say to him,\n'We cut thee off from those deities;' and he becomes the worse, and they\nthemselves become the better for it.\n\n12:1:3:2323\\. That same year contains three great rites (mahavrata):--the\ngreat rite on the _K_ aturvi _m_ _s_ a day, the great rite on the Vishuvat\nday, and the great rite 3 on the Mahavrata day itself. Now, those of old used,\nindeed, to enter upon (perform) that (year's session) with three great rites,\nand they became glorious, truth-speaking, and faithful to their vow; but if\nnowadays any (sattrins) were to perform it on this wise, they assuredly would\ncrumble away even as a jar of unbaked clay would crumble away if water were\npoured into it. They (who do so) perform too much: that (object) of theirs is\ngained by truth, by toil, by fervid devotion, by faith, by sacrifice, and by\noblations.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[141:1](sbe44047.htm#fr_430) See [XIV,\n1](sbe44117.htm#14:1:1)-[3](sbe44123.htm#14:3:1); and part ii, p. 104, note 3.\n\n[141:2](sbe44047.htm#fr_431) Viz.
