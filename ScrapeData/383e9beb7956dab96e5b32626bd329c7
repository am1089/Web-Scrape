Of these\nthere are four collections. Two of them comprise original hymns. The contents\nof the others consist largely of poems derived from the former two. The\ncollections of original hymns, known as the Rig Veda and the Atharva Veda,\ninclude, respectively, 1028 original hymns of about 10600 stanzas and 731\nhymns of about 6000 stanzas. All of these were kept in memory and transmitted\nby recitation and close memorizing on the part of teachers and pupils in an\nunbroken chain of early traditions from a time when writing was probably not\nknown. The opinions of scholars vary greatly regarding the antiquity of this\nliterature; some think that the hymns were composed about 6000 B. C. or at a\nstill earlier date, while others think that they were composed about 1200 B.\nC. or 1000 B. C. The Vedic hymns are probably the earliest important religious\ndocuments of the human race.1\n\nThe hymns of the Atharva Veda contain among other things descriptions of\ncharms for curing diseases, prayers for long life and health, imprecations\nagainst demons, sorcerers and enemies, charms pertaining to women--to secure\ntheir love or arouse jealousy, and\n\np. 4\n\nthe like--charms for securing harmony and influence in an assembly, charms for\nsecuring the prosperity of household, fields, cattle, business, gambling,\netc., charms in expiation of sins and defilement. The hymns of the Rig Veda,\non the other hand, are often praises of various deities, who are frequently\nmere personifications of the different powers of nature, such as the rain-god,\nthe wind-god, the fire-god, and the like. The prayers in these hymns are\npraises of the greatness and power, the mysterious nature, and the exploits of\nthese deities, as well as prayers for various favors. Often the favors sought\nare of the nature of material blessings, such as long life, vigorous\noffspring, cattle and horses, gold, etc. Prayers for the advancement of the\ninner spiritual achievements of man, for righteousness or moral greatness,\nprayers expressing a passionate longing for the divine or a humble submission\nof the mind to the divine will are not so frequent. Most of these prayers were\nrecited in the performance of certain prescribed rituals. Though from the\npraises of the gods one might infer that it was the gods who were supposed to\nbestow the benefits, it was in fact the complete set of ritualistic\nperformances that was considered to be the cause of the showering of the\nbenefits. It was supposed that these ritualistic performances when carried out\nin all their details, precisely and accurately, could by their joint and\nmysterious effect produce a mysterious something whereby the prayers were\nfulfilled. 2\n\nI shall omit from my discussion the hymns of the Atharva Veda which deal only\nwith spells, witchcraft\n\np. 5\n\nand incantations. But while I take for examination those hymns of the Rig Veda\nwhich express beautiful ideas about the nature-deities and which voice\npersonal requests for material comforts or for advantages, it should be\nunderstood that they also were chanted in connection with the performance of\nrituals and sacrifices. It is difficult to determine whether in the earliest\nperiod definite theories had been formulated regarding the intimate and\nindispensable connection between the chanting of these hymns of personal\nappeal and the performance of the rituals. But if we judge by the Vedic\nliterature of the Brahmanas (probably composed shortly after the hymns, and\nlater appended to them) which indicate authoritatively the place of these\nhymns in the ritualistic observances and specify what hymns were to be uttered\nunder what ritualistic conditions and in what order or manner, it seems almost\ncertain that the prevailing form of what is commonly called the Vedic religion\nmay in strictness not be considered as a religion in the ordinarily accepted\nmeaning of this term. Many of the ritualistic observances, or _yajna_ ,\nrequired the help of a large number of priests, and large quantities of\nbutter, rice, milk, animals, etc. They had to be performed with the most\nelaborate details from day to day, for months together and sometimes even for\nten or twelve years; and it was enjoined that all the observances should be\nperformed in exact accordance with the prescriptions laid down in the Brahmana\nliterature. Even the slightest inaccuracy or the most trifling inexactness\nwould be sufficient to spoil the entire effect of the sacrifice. But\n\np. 6\n\nif the sacrifices were performed with the strictest accuracy, then the\nmaterial advantages for which they were performed were bound to come\nregardless of the good will or the ill will of the gods to whom the prayers\nwere offered. Tvashtar had performed a sacrifice for the birth of a son who\nmight kill Indra, but owing to a slight error in pronunciation the meaning of\nthe prayer was changed and the sacrifice produced a son who was not a killer\nof Indra but of whom Indra was the killer. 3\n\nThis idea of sacrifice is entirely different from anything found in other\nraces. For with the Vedic people, the sacrifices were more powerful than the\ngods. The gods could be pleased or displeased; if the sacrifices were duly\nperformed the prayers were bound to be fulfilled. The utterance or chanting of\nthe stanzas of the Vedic hymns with specially prescribed accents and\nmodulations, the pouring of the melted butter in the prescribed manner into\nthe sacrificial fire, the husking of rice in a particular way, the making and\nexact placing of cakes, all the thousand details of rituals--often performed\ncontinuously for days, months and years with rigorous exactness--was called a\n_yajna_ (frequently translated into English, "sacrifice"). All the good things\nthat the people wanted, be it the birth of a son, a shower of rain, or a place\nof enjoyment in heaven, were believed to be secured through the performance of\nthese sacrifices. It is possible that when these hymns were originally\ncomposed, they were but simple prayers to the deified powers of nature, or\nthat they were only associated with some simple rituals.\n\np. 7\n\n[paragraph continues] But the evidence that is presented to us in the later\nVedic and non-Vedic records containing descriptions of these sacrifices and\ndiscussions respecting their value, convinces us beyond doubt that it was the\nperformance of these sacrifices, perfect in every detail in accordance with\nthe dictates of the sacrificial manuals, the Brahmanas, that was believed to\nbe capable of producing everything that a man could desire. A direct\nconsequence of this apparently unmeaning necessity of strictest accuracy of\nritualistic performances is a theory that came to be formulated and accepted\nin later periods, namely, that the sacrificial rites revealed such\nsupernatural wisdom that they could not have been made by any one but were\nself-existent. It came to be held that the hymns of the Vedas, as well as the\nsacrificial manuals, were without authorship; that they existed eternally,\nprescribing certain courses of ritualistic procedure for the attainment of\nparticular advantages and prohibiting certain undesirable courses of action.\nConsistently with the sacrificial theory it was also believed that the\nmeanings of the hymns, so far as they described events or facts of nature or\nthe exploits and the conduct of the gods were of a legendary character, that\ntheir true value consisted in the enjoining of particular courses of action or\nof dissuading people from other courses of action. 4\n\nReligion in its ordinarily accepted sense means a personal relationship with\nsome divine or transcendent person to whom we submit and to whom we pray for\nmaterial advantages or for spiritual or moral enlightenment.\n\np. 8\n\n[paragraph continues] But here was a belief in the divinity or the\nuncreatedness of a literature--the Vedas--which was believed to contain within\nitself the secret laws of the universe. Here there was a conception of\ncommands, categorical in nature and external in character, without the least\nsuggestion of any commander. Though these commands were supposed not to have\nemanated from any person, they may nevertheless in some sense be described as\ntranscendent, for they were regarded as far above human wisdom. No reason\ncould be given why a particular sacrificial performance should produce any\nparticular kind of material advantage. There stand the commands--commands\nwhich had revealed themselves to the minds of the various sages, which had no\nbeginning in time, which do not imply any commander, and which are absolutely\nfaultless and unerring in their directions. 5\n\nThe sacrifices, thus, were supposed to possess a mysterious power capable of\nregulating and modifying the workings of the universe for the advantage of\nindividuals; and the Vedic commands were thought to embody omniscience\nrespecting the ways of the world. Though the repository of omniscience, the\nVedas were not conceived as divulging to us their secrets but merely as\nproviding a body of directions which, if followed, would give whatever\nadvantages one craved in this life or the next. The sacrifices ( _yajna_ ) or\ntheir mysterious powers, are called _dharma_ , a term which in Indian\nvernaculars is often used wrongly to translate the English word "religion."\nThe Vedic hymns, the priests, and the sacrifices are also called "the great"\n\np. 9\n\nby the application of the term _brahman_ , which in later Indian philosophy\nand religion had such a momentous history. 6\n\nWhat we have described is no ordinary magic of spells and incantations, but a\nrepository of the cosmic secrets and cosmic forces. These impersonal commands\nunite in them the concepts of an unalterable law and perfect omniscience; they\nimply therefore the possibility of reaping all the comforts of this life and\nof the after-life by submission to them and compliance with them. But they\ninvolve no law-giver, no divine person, no author of the universe or of the\ndestinies of human beings who must be pacified, obeyed or loved, and by whose\ngrace we receive the blessings of life. We can control our own destinies, and\nhave whatever we may want, if we only follow the commands. There is no other\nmystery of life save this great mystery of the Vedic commands, and these are\nabsolutely inscrutable. These commands do not teach ordinary laws of social\nlife or of behavior toward our fellow-beings, or anything that we could\ndiscover by our own intelligence and wisdom. Neither do they teach us anything\nthat we could learn by experience or reason. They give direction for the\nattainment of the good things of this life or of the after-life only in so far\nas the means thereto are absolutely undiscoverable by us. They are not a body\nof facts, but a body of commands and prohibitions. Yet they do not represent\ncommands of the inner conscience or of the spirit within us; they do not give\nus any food for the spirit. They represent an objective and unalterable\n\np. 10\n\nlaw realistically conceived, and they relate to desires for material comforts\nin this life or the life in heaven. This concept gives us all the principal\nelements of religion except that of a divine person. The acceptance of the\nblessings of this life as gifts from God, and a sense of our duty to please\nHim by submission and prayer are, therefore, not implied in this system of\nVedic sacrifices. What is implied is some great impersonal force which\nharmonises ourselves and our destinies with the happenings and events of the\nworld of nature. Instead of God we find here a body of commands which demand\nour obedience and reverence; but the source of their power and the secret of\ntheir omniscient character and uncreatedness cannot be determined by us\nthrough reason or experience. But this ritualistic mysticism--if we may be\npermitted thus to call it--must be distinguished from the simple feelings and\nideas that are found in the hymns themselves. In all probability the latter\ndid not originally imply the complicated ritualistic hypotheses of the later\nperiod. 7\n\nThe forces of nature with their wonderful manifestations of inexplicable\nmarvels appeared to the early sages like great beings endowed with life and\npersonality. They were treated at times as friendly, but again as hostile.\nSometimes the mystery of the natural phenomena seemed stupifying in its\npsychological effect. The laws of nature were at that time unknown, and there\nwas no obstacle to the free flight of the imagination. When the Vedic sage saw\nthe sun proceeding\n\np. 11\n\nin his upward and downward course through the sky he cried out in his wonder:\n\n"Undropped beneath, not fastened firm, how comes it  \nThat downward turned he falls not downward?  \nThe guide of his ascending path,--who saw it?" 1\n\n[paragraph continues] The sage is full of wonder that "the sparkling waters of\nall rivers flow into one ocean without ever filling it." He perceives the\nunalterable course of the sun from day to day, and the succession of day and\nnight, and he exclaims with delight: "Every day, in unceasing interchange with\nnight and her dark wonders, comes the dawn with her beautiful ones to\nreanimate the worlds, never failing in her place, never in her time." Again,\nhe is puzzled when thinking whither the shining ones of the sky disappear, and\nhe cries forth in amazement:\n\n"Who is it knows, and who can tell us surely  \nWhere lies the path that leads to the Eternals?  \nTheir deepest dwellings only we discover,  \nAnd hidden these in distant secret regions."\n\n[paragraph continues] In how many hymns does the singer express his wonder\nthat the rough red cow gives soft white milk. To the god Indra he cries:\n\n"Grant me, O God, the highest, best of treasures,  \nA judging mind, prosperity abiding,  \nRiches abundant, lasting health of body,  \nThe grace of eloquence, and days propitious."\n\np. 12\n\n[paragraph continues] To the God of the destroying storm he prays:\n\n"Let me through thy best medicines, O Rudra,  \nMy life on earth prolong a hundred winters.  \nFrom us dispel all hatred and oppression,  \nOn every side calamity drive from us.\n\nWhere then, O Rudra, is thy hand of mercy,  \nThe hand that healing brings and softens sorrow,  \nThat takes away the ills which the gods send?  \nLet me, O mighty one, feel thy forgiveness.\n\nThe hero gladdened me amid tumult  \nWith greater might when I his aid entreated;  \nLike some cool shade from the Sun\'s heat protected  \nMay I attain to Rudra\'s grace and refuge."\n\n[paragraph continues] Again when he is penitent he would ask forgiveness of\nthe god Varuna, the personification of the all-embracing heaven, and say:\n\n"If we to any dear and loved companion  \nHave evil done, to brother or to neighbour,  \nTo our own countryman or to a stranger,  \nThat sin do thou O Varuna forgive us."\n\n[paragraph continues] Or,\n\n"Forgive the wrongs, committed by our fathers,  \nWhat we ourselves have sinned in mercy pardon;  \nMy own misdeeds do thou O God take from me,  \nAnd for another\'s sin let me not suffer."\n\n[paragraph continues] Or, again,\n\n"If ever we deceived like cheating players,  \nIf consciously we have erred or all unconscious  \nAccording to our sin do not thou punish;  \nBe thou the singer\'s guardian in thy wisdom."\n\n[paragraph continues] But besides these prayers, we sometimes find poems\n\np. 13\n\ncomposed by the Vedic people, descriptive of their varied experiences of\nordinary life. Thus a gambler gives his experience as follows:\n\n"My wife has never angered me nor striven,  \nWas ever kind to me and my companions;  \nThough she was faithful to me, I have spurned her,  \nFor love of dice, the only thing I value.\n\nThe gambler\'s wife deserted mourns; his mother  \nLaments her son, she knows not where he wanders  \nAnd he in debt and trouble, seeking money,  \nRemains at night beneath the roof of strangers.\n\nAnd when I say that I will play no longer,  \nMy friends abandon me and all desert me;  \nYet then again I hear the brown dice rattling  \nI hasten, like a wanton to her lover."\n\n[paragraph continues] Again we read:\n\n"The gambler hurries to the gaming table,  \n\'Today I\'ll win,\' he thinks in his excitement.  \nThe dice inflame his greed, his hopes mount higher;  \nHe leaves his winnings all with his opponent."\n\n[paragraph continues] When we read these hymns we see in them the simple\nprayers of a simple primitive people impressed with the inexplicable and\nvaried phenomena of a tropical climate. They turn to the forces behind the\nlatter as personified deities, describing the phenomena and offering their\nsimple prayers. We find in these prayers experiences of simple wonder, of\nsufferings and of simple enjoyments. But when we come to the sacrificial stage\nof development we find a religious outlook in which the independent simple\nmeanings of the\n\np. 14\n\nhymns possess importance only for their sacrificial utterance in particular\ncontexts. During the particular ritual observances the different verses were\noften torn out of their contexts and were combined with others which\napparently had little or no relation with them and no conceivable bearing on\nthe performances during which they were chanted or uttered. They were simply\nthe means for the performance of the sacrifices. Their simple meanings as\ndescriptions of things or events or phenomena or ideas were dropped from\nconsideration. The value attached to them centered about their being uttered\nor chanted in particular Vedic sacrifices in accordance with certain\nsacrificial canons of interpretation. The entire significance of these hymns\nconsisted either in their use as directions for the performance of certain\nsacrificial duties or in their utterance in these sacrifices under prescribed\nconditions as found in the sacrificial manuals, the Brahmanas, which were\nconsidered as part of the Vedas. Thought and feeling were driven from their\nplaces of importance in human nature, and the whole emphasis was laid on the\ninterpretation of the Vedic literature as a system of duties involving\ncommands and prohibitions, and nothing else. Some of these duties were\ncompulsory, while others were voluntary in the sense that they had to be\nperformed only when one wanted to secure some desired end unattainable by any\nmeans discoverable by his reason or experience. 8\n\nThe authority which this system of Vedic injunctions and prohibitions was\nsupposed to possess was so high as to demand the entire submission of one\'s\nwill\n\np. 15\n\nand thought. Their claims did not stand in need of any justification by reason\nor logic, for they were supposed to be guides in a sphere where reason and\nexperience were utterly helpless. The only fruitful way in which reason could\nbe employed with regard to these Vedic commands was by accepting their\nauthority and then trying to explain them in such a way that their mysterious\nnature might be reconciled to us. These Vedic commands cannot be described as\n"revelations" in the ordinary Christian sense of the term; for the latter\npresupposes the existence of a living God able and willing to bestow the body\nof truths that man requires, whereas the Vedic commands are devoid of any\nnotion of a law-giver. This sacrificial mysticism, if it may be so called,\ndoes not recognize any God or supreme being from whom these commands emanate\nor who reveals them to man. The commands are taken as eternal truths,\nbeginningless and immortal, revealing themselves to man and demanding man\'s\nsubmission to them. Nevertheless they are not spiritual or inner truths\nrevealed from within man himself; they are external and impersonal commands\nwhich contain within themselves the inscrutable secrets of nature and of the\nhappiness of man. 9\n\nThe fact that the Vedas were regarded as revelations of eternal truths, truths\nwhich no human reason could ever challenge, naturally divested reason of\nconfidence in its ability to unravel the mysteries of man and of the world.\nEven in the somewhat later days of the evolution of Vedic culture, when there\ngrew up a school of thinkers who disbelieved the claim that the\n\np. 16\n\nwhole of the Vedas were nothing but a body of commands and prohibitions and\nwho held that there were at least some particular portions of the Vedas which\ndealt with the eternal truths of spiritual facts and experiences of reality,\nthe belief remained unshaken that what the Vedas gave one as truths were\nunshakeable and unchallengeable by reason or by experience. This means a\ndefinite lowering or degradation of reason in its capacity as truth-finder.\nReason calls for counter-reason and leads through an endless regressus without\never being able to lead to truth. The Vedas, then, are the only repository of\nthe highest truths, and the function of reason is only to attempt to reconcile\nthese truths with our experience and sense-observation. It is surprising that\nreason has continued to remain in this subordinate position throughout the\ndevelopment of Indian religious and philosophical thought almost to our own\ndays. No change, no new idea could be considered to be right or could be\nbelieved by the people, unless it could also be shown that it had the sanction\nof the Vedas. Reason was never trusted as the only true and safe guide. 10\n\nThe word "mysticism" is a European word with a definite history. Most European\nwriters have used it to denote an intuitive or ecstatic union with the deity,\nthrough contemplation, communion, or other mental experiences, or to denote\nthe relationship and potential union of the human soul with ultimate reality.\nBut I should for my present purposes like to give it a wider meaning which\nwould include this and the other different types of mysticism that I may be\ndiscussing\n\np. 17\n\nin the course of this series of lectures. I should like to define mysticism as\na theory, doctrine, or view that considers reason to be incapable of\ndiscovering or of realising the nature of ultimate truth, whatever be the\nnature of this ultimate truth, but at the same time believes in the certitude\nof some other means of arriving at it. If this definition be accepted, then\nthis ritualistic philosophy of the Vedas is the earliest form of mysticism\nthat is known to India or to the world. This Vedic mysticism prepared the way\nfor the rise of the other forms of mysticism that sprang up in India.\nSubsequent lectures will deal with these later forms, in some of which at\nleast it will be easy to notice their similarity to Western types of mysticism\nwith which Western readers are more or less familiar. 11\n\nThe main elements of the sacrificial mysticism of the Vedas may be summarised\nas follows: First, a belief that the sacrifices when performed with perfect\naccuracy, possess a secret, mysterious power to bring about or produce as\ntheir effect whatever we may desire either in this life or in the hereafter.\nSecond, the conception of an unalterable law--involved in such invariable and\nunfailing occurrences of effects consequent upon the performance of these\nsacrifices. Third, an acceptance of the impersonal nature of the Vedic\nliterature, as having existed by itself from beginningless time and as not\ncreated or composed by any person, human or divine. Fourth, the view that the\nVedic literature embodies nothing but a system of duties involving commands\nand prohibitions. Fifth, a recognition of the supreme authority of the Vedas\n\np. 18\n\nas the only source of the knowledge of ultimate truths which are far beyond\nthe powers of human reason. Sixth, the view that truth or reality, whether it\nbe of the nature of commands or of facts (as was maintained by the later Vedic\nschools of thought, the Upanishads), could be found once for all in the words\nof the Vedas. Seventh, the belief that the Vedic system of duties demands\nunfailing obedience and submission. Two definite characteristics emerge from\nthese: first, the transcendent, mysterious, and secret power of the\nsacrifices, replacing the natural forces personified as gods; second, the\nultimate superiority of the Vedas as the source of all truths, and as the\nunchallengeable dictators of our duties, leading to our material well-being\nand happiness. The assumption of the mysterious omnipotence of sacrifices,\nperformed by following the authoritative injunctions of the Vedas\nindependently of reason or logical and discursive thought, forms the chief\ntrait of the mysticism of the Vedic type. There is nothing here of feeling or\neven of intellect, but a blind submission, not to a person but to an\nimpersonal authority which holds within it an unalterable and inscrutable law,\nthe secret of all powers which we may want to wield in our favor. 12\n\nThe next step in the development of this type of mysticism consists in the\ngrowth of a school of thought which sought to intellectualise the material\nsacrifices. It encouraged the belief that it was quite unnecessary actually to\nperform the sacrifices requiring the expenditure of enormous sums of money for\nthe collection of materials and for labor. The same results\n\np. 19\n\nmight be as well obtained through certain kinds of meditation or reflection.\nThus, instead of the actual performance of a horse sacrifice, in which the\nimmolation of a horse is accompanied by other rituals engaging the services of\nlarge numbers of men and the expenditure of funds such as kings alone could\nprovide, one might as well think of the dawn as the head of a horse, the sun\nas its eye, the wind as its life, the heaven as its back, the intervening\nspace as its belly, the sky as its flesh and the stars as its bones. Such a\nmeditation, or rather concentrated imagining of the universe as a cosmic\nhorse, would, it was maintained, produce all the beneficial results that could\nbe expected from the performance of an actual horse sacrifice. Thus, these\nattempts to intellectualise sacrifices took the form of replacing by\nmeditation the actual sacrifices, and this substitution was believed to\nproduce results which were equally beneficial. This meditation by substitution\ngradually took various forms: certain letters of the alphabet had, for\nexample, to be thought of, or meditated upon, as Brahman or some other deity,\nor as vital functions of the body, or as some personified nature deity. This\nmeditation was supposed to produce beneficial results. It should not be\nsupposed that the sacrificial forms were entirely supplanted by these new\nforms of substitution-meditations. Rather did they spring up side by side with\nthem. These forms of meditation did not mean prolonged contemplation, or any\nlogical process of thinking, but merely the simple practice of continually\nthinking of one entity, process, or letter as another entity or process. 13\n\np. 20\n\nEven in modern India there are still many men who believe that the repetition\nof mystical formulas (apparently meaningless combinations of letters, or the\nnames of some deities) is capable of producing beneficial results. Even the\nworship of a round or an oval stone as the god Vishnu or Siva, or again the\nworship of a waterjug or an image as a particular god or goddess, is nothing\nbut a modified form of substitution-meditation, one thing being considered and\nmeditated upon as another. These practices are to be distinguished from the\nordinary spells and incantations commonly believed in by uneducated people.\nThese substitution-meditations are often believed to be productive of virtue.\nThey form the normal modes of worship of the ordinary Hindu and have now taken\nthe place of the old sacrifices. Nevertheless the old Vedic sacrifices are\nalso to a certain extent performed on occasions of marriages and other\ndomestic ceremonies, as an indispensable part of those ceremonies which still\nclaim to belong entirely to the Vedic order. 14\n\nBut, refraining from further references to modern India, let us pick up our\nthread of discussion and note the next stage in the development of the\nsubstitution-meditations. Although the latter were in their conception\ndoubtless as mystical and magical as the old sacrifices, they represent an\nadvance. For in them the mystical powers are supposed to reside not in\nexternal performances, but in specific forms of meditation or thinking. This\nrepresents an approach toward a consciousness of self and toward a recognition\nof the mystical powers of thought and meditation of a\n\np. 21\n\npeculiar type. But it was only after an almost endless and fruitless search\nthat the highest idea of self and the highest idea of world mystery and its\nsolution dawned in the minds of the Vedic thinkers. What we find at this stage\nis merely that the Vedic thinkers had become conscious of the activity of\nthought and of imagination, and had begun to realise that the activity\ninvolved in thinking ought to be considered to be as potent a power as the\nactivity involved in the actual performances of material sacrifices. Man\'s\ninner thought and his performance of sacrificial duties in the world outside\nare both regarded as capable of producing mysterious changes and\ntransformations in nature which would benefit man. Passages are to be found in\nthe literature where the vital and other inner processes of the self are\ncompared with a sacrifice. The three periods of human life are considered as\nbeing the same as the three bruisings of the sacrificial plant soma; and the\nfunctions of hungering, eating and begetting are considered to be the same as\nthe different ceremonies of the soma sacrifice. Logical thinking in Vedic\ntimes seems to have taken the form of crude generalisation. The fundamental\noperation of logical thinking is generalisation based on a scrutiny of facts\nof experience, noting differences and avoiding false identifications. But in\nthe early stages of Vedic thinking, generalisations were very crude and based\non insufficient data, slurring points of difference and making bold\nidentifications. Thus from the fact that we perspire through heat, there arose\nthe cosmological belief that out of fire there came water.\n\np. 22\n\n[paragraph continues] From observation of three principal colors, red, white\nand black (the colors of fire, water and earth) sprang the idea that the\nuniverse is made up of the three elements, viz., fire, water and earth. It was\nthought that wherever there was red, it was due to the existence of fire,\nwherever there was white it was due to the existence of water, and wherever\nthere was black, it was due to the existence of earth. 15\n\nBy a similar loose process of generalisation the word Brahman came to denote\nthe Vedic verses, truth, sacrifices, and knowledge. Etymologically the word\nmeans "The Great." Probably it signified vaguely and obscurely the mysterious\npower underlying these sacrifices and the substitution-meditations. Both the\nideas involved in the conception of Brahman as the highest power and the\nhighest knowledge were derived from the notion of the sacrifices. Thus we read\nin the celebrated man-hymn of the Rig Veda that the gods offered the supreme\nman as a sacrifice and that from this great oblation all living creatures, as\nwell as the atmosphere, sky, earth and the four quarters, came into being.\nThree parts of this supreme man transcend the world while one part of him is\nthe whole world about us; and yet, he is himself both the sacrifice and the\nobject of the sacrifice.\n\nBut while I have just emphasised the importance of the mysticism of sacrifice\nin the development of the mystical conception of Brahman as the supreme being,\nit would be wrong to hold that the mysticism of the sacrifices is alone\nresponsible for the evolution of the great concept of Brahman. Side by side\nwith the concept\n\np. 23\n\nfound in the Rig Veda of the many gods as personifications of the forces of\nnature, there was also growing a tendency toward the conception of one supreme\nbeing, and this tendency gradually gained in force. Thus, in Rig Veda X. 114.5\nwe find a verse in which it is said that the deity is one, though he is called\nby various names. One of the hymns (R. V. X. 129), again, runs as follows: 16\n\n"Then there was neither Aught nor Naught, no air nor sky beyond.  \nWhat covered all? Where rested all? In watery gulf profound?  \nNor death was then, nor deathlessness, nor change of night and day.  \nThat one breathed calmly, self-sustained; naught else beyond it lay.  \nGloom hid in gloom existed first--one sea eluding view.  \nThe one a void in chaos wrapt, by inward fervor grew.  \nWithin it first arose desire, the primal germ of mind,  \nWhich nothing with existence links, as ages searching find.  \nThe kindling ray that shot across the dark and drear abyss,--  \nWas it beneath or high aloft? What bard can answer this?  \nThere fecundating powers were found and mighty forces strove,  \nA self-supporting mass beneath, and energy above.  \nWho knows and who ever told, from whence this vast creation rose?  \nNo gods had then been born. Who then can e\'er the truth disclose  \nWhence sprang this world, whether framed by hand divine or no,  \nIts lord in heaven alone can tell, if he can show." 2\n\np. 24\n\nAgain, in the Atharva Veda (X, 7.) we find a hymn dedicated to Skambha where\nthe different parts of this deity are identified not only with the different\nparts of the material world but also with a number of moral qualities such as\nfaith, austere fervor, truthfulness, etc. All the thirty-three gods of the\nVedas are contained within him and bow down to him. He is also called Brahman,\n"The Great." In the next hymn of the Atharva Veda (X. 8) Brahman is adored and\nspoken of as presiding over the past and the future, and he is said to be\nresiding within our hearts and to be the self which never decays but is self-\nexistent and self-satisfied. This appears to be very much like the idea of the\nUpanishads of which I shall speak in my next lecture. In the Shatapatha\nBrahmana, also, we hear of Brahman as having created the gods; and in the\nTaittiriya Brahmana, Brahman is said to have created the gods and the entire\nworld. 17\n\nThus we find that the conception of one great being who created the world and\nthe gods, and who is also the power presiding over our lives and spirits, was\ngradually dawning in the minds of a few people. And though the sacrificial\ntheory tended to lead away from the ordinary meanings of these Vedic hymns,\nthe development of the sacrificial theory itself also made for the conception\nof some mysterious force which reconciled the destinies of the world and\nnature with those of men and their desires. This mysterious power, it was\nheld, is resident not only in things external but also in activities of the\ninner life; it manifests itself in the power of thought, as is exemplified by\nthe mysterious\n\np. 25\n\nefficacy of the substitution-meditations. What was the nature of this\nmysterious power? It is difficult to answer this question. We have seen that\nits conception varied in significance according to the mode of its development\nand the sources from which it evolved. But when once the conception was\nformed, all these constituent notions were mixed together. People regarded\nBrahman as the highest, but they did not know how Brahman was to be known.\nThose who started with the sacrificial bias, thought substitution-meditations\nto be the way to a knowledge of Brahman. And so we find various instructions\nregarding meditation upon objects, such as the wind, life, fire, etc.,--even\nupon unmeaning letters. 18\n\nBut parallel with this tendency went another, viz., an intellectual search\nafter Brahman, the highest, which displayed a contempt for sacrifices. We find\nBrahmins going out of their own sphere to warrior castes and kings for secret\ninstruction about the nature of Brahman. There are narratives in which we find\nthat kings belonging to the warrior caste fill proud Brahmins with a sense of\ndiscomfiture by exposing the ignorance of the latter concerning the secret\nnature of Brahman. Thus Balaki Gargya approached King Ajatashatru with the\nrequest to be allowed to explain to him the nature of Brahman. He then tried\ntwelve times in succession to define Brahman as the presiding person in the\nsun, moon, lightning, ether, wind, fire, water, etc.; and in each case King\nAjatashatru refuted him by showing the lower position that such presiding\npersons occupy in the whole of the universe, whereas\n\np. 26\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahman should be that which is the highest. Again, we\nfind another narrative in which five Brahmins meet and discuss the question,\n"What is our Atman and what is Brahman?" They proceed to Uddalaka Aruni with\nthe question. When Uddalaka mistrusts his ability to answer the question, all\nsix go to King Ashvapati Kaikeya for instruction. King Ashvapati first asks\nthem what it is that they worship as Atman or Brahman, anticipating their\nerror that they still regard Atman or Brahman as a new kind of external\ndivinity. The six Brahmins explain Atman in succession as the heaven, the sun,\nthe wind, space, water, and the earth, and in so doing assume it to be an\nobjective and an external deity more or less like the old Vedic deities. This\nshows us a stage of thought in which people somehow understood Brahman to be\nthe highest principle, but yet found it difficult to shake off their old\nconceptions of external deities or personifications of nature. Again we find\nSanatkumara instructing Narada regarding the nature of Brahman. In so doing\nSanatkumara starts from "Name," by which he probably understands all\nconceptual knowledge. With his peculiar logic, which is difficult for us to\nfollow, he observes that speech is greater than name, that mind is greater\nthan speech, that imagination is greater than mind, and so on. Passing in\nsuccession through a number of such concepts, from lower to higher, he\nultimately stops at that which is absolutely great, the unlimited, beyond\nwhich there is nothing and within which is comprehended all that is to be\nfound in the outer and the inner world. 19\n\np. 27\n\nThe most important point to be noted in the development of this stage of\nthought is that worship or prayer is possible only as directed toward a deity\nconceived with limited powers and as occupying a subordinate position in the\nuniverse. But with reference to that which is conceived as the highest truth\nand the highest power, there is no longer the possibility of external forms of\nworship. We shall find in the next lecture not only that it is not possible to\nworship Brahman but that it is not possible to reach Brahman by logical\nthought or any kind of conceptual apprehension. Thus in a Upanishadic story,\nreferred to by Shankara, we are told of a person who approached a sage Bahva\nand sought from him instructions regarding the nature of Brahman. Bahva did\nnot speak. He was asked a second time; still he did not speak. Yet again he\nwas asked, but still he did not speak. When the inquirer became annoyed by\nthis, Bahva told him that he was, from the first, by his silence telling him\nhow Brahman was to be described: Brahman is silence and so cannot be\nrepresented in speech. There are, however, unmistakable indications that there\nwere still some who believed that even the highest could be worshipped and\nadored and that men could still submit themselves to Him as to the highest\npersonal God who comprehends us all and controls us all. But the idea that was\ngradually gaining ground with some of the most important sages, and which will\nbe expounded in the next lecture, was that Brahman, as the highest, is no\nordinary personal God who can be induced by worship to favor us or who can be\napproached by the\n\np. 28\n\npure intellect or even by feeling. Brahman still retains its mysterious\ncharacter as the highest power, truth, being and bliss which can neither be\nworshipped nor known by ordinary means of knowledge. But its nature can be\nrealised, and realised so perfectly that the realisation will be like the\nbursting of a shell of light, a revelation which will submerge the whole of\none\'s life together with all that it contains. The next lecture will describe\nthis type of mysticism of the Upanishads, which represents one of the highest\nand best, and undoubtedly one of the most distinctive, types of mysticism that\nIndia has produced. 20\n\nThe Upanishads form the concluding portions of the Vedic literature, both\nchronologically from the point of view of the development of ideas. They were\ncomposed later than the priestly manuals, the Brahmanas, and the manuals of\nsubstitution-meditations in the Aranyaka literature, and they form the most\nauthoritative background of all later Hindu philosophical thought. They\npossess the high authority of the Vedas and are the source of the highest\nwisdom and truth. The word "Upanishad" has been interpreted etymologically by\nShankara to mean "that which destroys all ignorance and leads us to Brahman."\nIt has also been interpreted to mean a secret or mystical doctrine, or a\nsecret instruction, or a secret and confidential sitting. I have elsewhere, in\nmy _History of Indian Philosophy_ , shown how all the different systems of\northodox Indian philosophy look to the Upanishads for light and guidance,\ndifferently interpreting the Upanishad texts to suit their own specific\nsystems of thought.\n\np. 29\n\n[paragraph continues] Eleven of these, Isha, Kena, Katha, Prashna, Mundaka,\nMandukya, Taittiriya, Aitareya, Chandogya, Brihadaranyaka, and Svetashvatara,\nare probably the oldest. They vary greatly in length: while the Isha Upanishad\nwould occupy but a single printed page, Brihadaranyaka would occupy at least\nfifty pages. Since the longer ones probably contain compositions of different\nperiods and of different authorship they represent various stages of evolution\nand exhibit different intentions. Being the concluding portions of the Vedas,\nthey are called the Vedanta. Their interpretations by different later writers\ngave rise to different systems of Vedanta philosophy. (One of these well-known\nforms of Vedanta philosophy was made known to the western world for the first\ntime by a gifted Hindu, Svami Vivekananda.) The Upanishads themselves,\nhowever, do not seem to have been written in a systematic, well-connected and\nlogical form. They are mystical experiences of the soul gushing forth from\nwithin us; they sparkle with the beams of a new light; they quench our thirst,\nborn at their very sight. It was of these that the German philosopher\nSchopenhauer said: "How does every line display its firm and definite and\nthroughout harmonious meaning. From every sentence deep, original, and sublime\nthoughts arise and the whole is pervaded by a high and holy and earnest\nspirit. . . . In the whole world there is no study, except that of the\noriginals, so beneficial and so elevating as that of the Upanishads. It has\nbeen the solace of my life, it will be the solace of my death." Cases are\nknown in which even Christian\n\np. 30\n\nmissionaries, sent out to India to teach church doctrines to clergymen or to\npreach Christianity among the Indians, became so fascinated by the high and\nlofty teachings of the Upanishads that they introduced the teaching of the\nUpanishads in the Church and as a consequence were compelled to resign their\nposts. To Hindus of all denominations there is nothing higher and holier than\nthe inspired sayings of the Upanishads. To them we shall address our attention\nin the next lecture. 21\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[11:1](hm03.htm#fr_0) This translation is from Kaegi-Arrowsmith, _The Rig\nVeda_ , p. 35.
