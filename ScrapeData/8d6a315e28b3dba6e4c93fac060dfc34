If, apart from the Light, no object exists, then how arises all the\nexperience ending with initiation into the Supreme Truth?\n\n2-3\\. Who is bound and liberated? Why is one bound? What may be the definition\nof Maya? Thus may an enquirer ask. With a view to answer these questions, and\nin order (that the disciple may) understand the matter with ease, what has\nbeen taught in the seven stanzas is again told in brief.\n\n4\\. Repetition in word or sense can be no fault here (in this Sastra).\nFrequent\n\np. 151\n\nreiteration only shows how momentous the theme is.\n\nThe meaning of the eighth stanza may be explained as follows:--\n\n#### All experience is a Fiction.\n\n5-6\\. To imagine in Paramesvara, in the One Self-luminous Existence, the\nrelation of cause and effect and other things of various sorts, is like\nimagining, the head of Rahu, empty space in akasa, \'my self,\' the body of an\nidol, and so on,--as not referring to distinct realities.\n\nRahu and Ketu are, respectively, the head and the trunk of one Rakshasa\'s body\nsevered into two; so that, when one speaks of the head of Rahu, we cannot\nsuppose that the head exists distinct from Rahu. The two are, in fact, one.\nSimilarly when Paramesvara is spoken of as the cause of the universe, we\nshould not understand that the universe is distinct from Paramesvara. There is\nonly one existence, namely, Paramesvara.\n\np. 152\n\n7\\. Isvara amuses Himself assuming, of His own accord, the forms of worshipper\nand the worshipped, of teacher and disciple, of master and servant, and so on.\n\n8\\. He who is a son with reference to his father is himself the father with\nreference to his son; one alone, indeed, is imagined in various ways according\nto mere words.\n\n9\\. Therefore, on investigating supreme truth, we find that the Light alone\nexists. False (mithya) indeed is all notion of difference in Atman, caused as\nit is by Maya.\n\np. 153\n\n#### The meaning of "mithya"\n\n10\\. Falseness (mithyatva) consists in being nullified when right knowledge\narises. Then, the master instructing the disciple and all else appear like a\ndream.\n\n#### Truth taught through fiction.\n\n11\\. The Vedanta, though in itself false may enable one to understand the Real\nTruth, like the idol of a God, or like a drawing, or like a reflection.\n\n#### Maya nullified by knowledge.\n\n12\\. All our mundane experience is a display of Maya. Like unto sushupti, Maya\nis nullified by knowledge of Atman.\n\n#### Maya defined.\n\np. 154\n\n13\\. The name \'may\xc4\x81\' is given to an appearance which cannot be accounted for.\nIt is not non-existent, because it appears; neither is it existent, because it\nis nullified.\n\n14\\. It is not distinct from the Light, as the dark shadow is distinct from\nthe sun. Neither is it identical with the Light because it is insentient. Nor\ncan it be both distinct from and identical with the Light, because it is a\ncontradiction in terms.\n\nOr, Maya may be compared to the shadow which conceals the sun from the view of\nthose who are blind by day. Here the sun\'s light itself appears to be a\nshadow; and the shadow, therefore, has no distinct existence from the light.\n\n15\\. It is not said to be made up of parts, because no parts caused it.\nNeither\n\np. 155\n\nis it devoid of parts, since in the effects it is made up of parts.\n\n16\\. This harlot of a Maya, appearing only so long as not scrutinised, does\ndeceive the Atman by her false affectations of coquetry.\n\n#### Moksha is the eradication of Maya.\n\n17\\. Some seek not her radical destruction. How, in their view, can there be a\nrelease from manas?\n\n18\\. Manas is subject to the three avasthas of jagrat, svapna, and sushupti,\nwhich revolve like a wheel, as the chief cause of the illusions of duality.\n\np. 156\n\n19\\. On account of these (illusions) manas performs acts and is again bound by\nthem. A mere witness of manas is the Atman beyond, just as the sun (is the\nwitness of our acts).\n\n20\\. Just as the sun is never affected by acts which are done by creatures\nbelow, so also, Atman, witness as He is, is never bound by the doings of\nmanas.\n\n21\\. That Atman does acts, that He is bound by them, and that He is released\nfrom them, is true only in a figurative sense; it is a mere illusion.\n\n22\\. Just as the sun, though untouched by smoke, clouds, dust and fog, yet\nlooks as if he were covered by them, so\n\np. 157\n\n[paragraph continues] Atman looks as if He were covered by Maya.\n\n23-24\\. Just as a young lad whirling round and round in sport, sees the world\naround him revolving round and round and the heavens containing hundreds of\nmoons; so Jiva, deluded by Maya, in virtue of the vasanas (tendencies caused\nby former experience) sees this whole universe revolving in various forms.\n\n25\\. In contact with manas, the Divine Atman looks as if He were coursing\nthrough the world, just as the sun, by contact with water, appears to move in\nmany a form.\n\np. 158\n\n26\\. That man who, by practice of Yoga, has freed manas from objects, becomes\nabstracted from this world, and he shall, at once, grow into a Jivanmukta.\n\n27\\. The Sruti says: By Maya, Siva became two birds always associated\ntogether; the One, clinging to the one unborn (Prakriti), became many as it\nwere (vide Mundaka-Up. 3-1; Yajniki-Upanishad 12-5).\n\n28\\. Thus ends the Eighth chapter in brief in the work called Manasollasa\nwhich expounds the meaning of the Hymn to the Blessed Dakshinamurti.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter IX.
