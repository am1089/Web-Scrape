I take\ngreat care of myself; I never go out in the rain; I wear warm clothes; I eat\ngood food. Yet I am always catching cold, or getting fever, in spite of all\nprecautions.'\n\n'Overmuch care is worse than none at all,' answered the Wuzeer, 'which I will\nsoon prove to you.'\n\nSo he invited the Rajah to accompany him for a walk in the fields. Before they\nhad gone very far they met a poor Shepherd. The Shepherd was accustomed to be\nout all day long tending his flock; he had only a coarse cloak on, which\nserved but insufficiently to protect him from the rain and the cold--from the\ndews by night and the sun by day; his food was parched corn, his drink water;\nand he lived out in the fields in a small hut made of plaited palm branches.\nThe Wuzeer said to the Rajah, 'You know perfectly well what hard lives these\npoor shepherds lead. Accost this one, and ask him if he often suffers from the\nexposure which he is obliged to undergo.'\n\nThe Rajah did as the Wuzeer told him, and asked the Shepherd whether he did\nnot often suffer from rheumatism, cold, and fever. The Shepherd answered, 'Nor\nSire, I never suffer from either the one or the other. From childhood I have\nbeen accustomed to endure the extremes of heat and cold, and I suppose that is\nwhy they never affect me.'\n\nAt this the Rajah was very much astonished, and he said to the Wuzeer, 'I own\nI am surprised; but doubtless this Shepherd is an extraordinarily strong man,\nwhom nothing would ever affect.'\n\n'We shall see,' said the Wuzeer; and he invited the Shepherd to the Palace.\nThere, for a long time, the Shepherd was taken great care of; he was never\npermitted to go out in the sun or rain, be had good food and good clothes, and\nhe was not allowed to sit in a draught or get his feet wet.\n\nAt the end of sonic months the Wuzeer sent for him into a marble court-yard,\nthe floor of which he caused to be sprinkled with water.\n\nThe Shepherd had been for some time so little used to exposure of any kind,\nthat wetting his feet caused him to take cold; the place felt to him chilly\nand damp after the Palace; he rapidly became worse, and in a short time, in\nspite of all the doctor's care, he died.\n\n'Where is our friend the Shepherd? asked the Rajah a few days afterwards; 'he\nsurely could not have caught cold by merely treading on the marble floor you\nhad caused to be sprinkled with water?'\n\n'Alas!' answered the Wuzeer, 'the result was more disastrous than I had\nanticipated; the poor Shepherd caught cold, and is dead. Having been lately\naccustomed to overmuch care, the sudden change of temperature killed him.\n\n'You see now to what dangers we are exposed from which the poor are exempt. It\nis thus that Nature equalises her best gifts; wealth and opulence tend too\nfrequently to destroy health and shorten life, though they may give much\nenjoyment to it whilst it lasts.'\n\n![](img/19.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IX.
