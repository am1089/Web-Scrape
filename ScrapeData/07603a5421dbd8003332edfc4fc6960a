There is no truth in the assertion that\nfrom the designation of the Highest as a biidge (or bank) it follows that\nthere is something beyond the Highest.

And in the clause 'having passed beyond that bridge'\nthe _passing beyond_ means _reaching_ ; as we say, 'he passes beyond the\nVedAnta,' meaning 'he has fully mastered it.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 32.
