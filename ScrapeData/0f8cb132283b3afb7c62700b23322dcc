On account of the impossibility (of qualification for the madhuvidya,\n&c.) ( _G_ aimini maintains the non-qualification (of gods, &c.).\n\nSo far it has been proved that also the gods, and so on, are qualified for the\nknowledge of Brahman. But a further point here presents itself for\nconsideration, viz. whether the gods are qualified or not to undertake those\nmeditations of which they themselves are the objects. The Sutra states as a\npurvapaksha view held by _G_ aimini, that they are not so qualified, for the\nreason that there are no other \xc3\x82dityas, Vasus, and so on, who could be\nmeditated on by the \xc3\x82dityas and Vasus themselves; and that moreover for the\n\xc3\x82dityas and Vasus the qualities and position of those classes of deities\ncannot be objects of desire, considering that they possess them already. The\nso-called Madhuvidya ( _Kh_. Up. III) represents as objects of devout\nmeditation certain parts of the sun which are being enjoyed by the different\nclasses of divine beings, Vasus, \xc3\x82dityas, and so on--the sun being there\ncalled 'madhu.' i.e. honey or nectar, on account of his being the abode of a\ncertain nectar to be brought about by certain sacrificial works to be known\nfrom the _Ri_ g-veda, and so on; and as the reward of such meditation the text\nnames the attainment of the position of the Vasus, \xc3\x82dityas, and so on.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 31.
