Now, Naka Maudgalya once said, 'If he believe the Sacrificer to be\nabout to die, let him take\n\np. 202\n\nup the two fires in the churning-sticks, and, having churned out (a new fire),\nlet him continue offering (the Agnihotra) at whatever place may have commended\nitself to him for the immolation 1. And if the Sacrificer should then depart\nthis world,--\n\n12:5:2:22\\. Let him build a pile for him 2 in the midst of his fires, and, by\nburning him, unite him with his fires.' But let him not do this; for, verily,\nthat (fire) does not submit thereto that they should make offering to it as\nfor the burning of a dead body: it is rather to sacrifice and oblations that\nit submits, and, unable to endure it, it stays by him with impatience.\n\n12:5:2:33\\. He should rather proceed thus:--let him bid them seek three pots,\nand, having put therein either (dried) cowdung or straw 3, let him place them\nseparately on the (three) fires; and let them then burn him by means of the\nfires produced from that blaze: in this way he is indeed burned by (these)\nfires, though not visibly, so to speak.\n\n12:5:2:44\\. Wherefore, also, it has been said by the _Ri_ shi (Va _g_. S.\nXIII, 45 4), 'The Agni who was born from Agni, from the pain of the earth or\nbe it of the sky; whereby Vi _s_ vakarman begat\n\np. 203\n\nliving beings, him, O Agni, may thy wrath spare!' As the verse, so its\nexplanation.\n\n12:5:2:55\\. Now, in the first place, he cleanses him of all foul matter, and\ncauses the foul matter to settle on this (earth); for this (earth) is indeed\nfoul matter: he thus consigns foul matter to foul matter. For, indeed, from\nthat intestine of his, filled with foul matter, when it is burnt, a jackal is\nproduced: (hence he removes it), 'lest a jackal should be produced.' But let\nhim not do this, or his family will be liable to starve. Having washed him out\ninside, he anoints him with ghee, and thus makes it (the body) sacrificially\npure.\n\n12:5:2:66\\. He then inserts seven chips of gold in the seven seats of his\nvital airs; for gold is light and immortality: he thus bestows light and\nimmortality on him.\n\n12:5:2:77\\. Having then built a pile for him in the midst of his fires, and\nspread out a black antelope skin with the hairy side upwards, and the neck-\npart towards the east, he lays him down thereon with the face looking upwards,\nand puts the _g_ uhu-spoon filled with ghee on his right, and the upabh _ri_ t\non his left hand, the dhruva on the breast, the Agnihotra-ladle on the mouth,\ntwo dipping-spoons on the nostrils, two pra _s_ itra-hara _n_ as 1 on the\nears, the cup used for carrying forward the lustral water on the head, two\nwinnowing-baskets at the sides, on the belly the vessel used for holding the\ncuttings (of the i _d_ a), filled with clotted ghee, the wedge (yoke-pin)\nbeside the male organ, two mallets beside the testicles, and behind them the\nmortar and pestle,\n\np. 204\n\nthe other sacrificial vessels between the thighs; and the wooden sword on the\nright hand.\n\n12:5:2:88\\. Thus supplied with the sacrificial weapons (implements), that\nSacrificer passes on to that place which has been won by him in heaven, even\nas if one who fears spoliation were to escape it; and, verily, those fires\n(which are) to be enkindled (will) lovingly touch him, even as sons lovingly\ntouch their father when he comes home after staying abroad, and make\neverything ready for him 1.\n\n12:5:2:99\\. If the Garhapatya were to reach him first, one may know that the\npermanent fire has reached him first: that he will permanently establish\nhimself, and that those behind him will permanently establish themselves in\nthis world.\n\n12:5:2:1010\\. And if the \xc3\x82havaniya were to do so, one may know that the\nforemost fire has reached him first: that he has been foremost in conquering\nthe (other) world, and that those behind him will be foremost in this world.\n\n12:5:2:1111\\. And if the Anvaharyapa _k_ ana were to do so, one may know that\nthe food-eating fire has reached him first: that he will eat food, and that\nthose behind him will eat food (be prosperous) in this world.\n\n12:5:2:1212\\. And if they all (were to reach him) at the same time, one may\nknow that he has conquered a blessed world. Such, then, are the distinctions\nin this respect.\n\n12:5:2:1313\\. This, then, is that offering of the Sacrificer's body which he\nperforms at the end: front out of that place which has been won by him in\nheaven he arises immortal in the form of an oblation.\n\np. 205\n\n12:5:2:1414\\. Whatever stone and earthen (vessels of the deceased) there are\nthey may be given to a Brahma _n_ a 1; but, verily, he who accepts them is\nregarded as a remover of corpses. Let them rather throw these (vessels) into\nthe water, for the waters are the foundation of all this (universe): he thus\nestablishes him firmly on the waters.\n\n12:5:2:1515\\. Either a son (of the deceased), or a brother, or some other\nBrahma _n_ a then performs that offering 2, with (Va _g_. S. XXXV, 22), 'From\nout of him thou (O Agni) art born: from out of thee let this N.N. be born\nagain into the heavenly world, hail! They then go away without looking back.\nand touch water.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[202:1](sbe44063.htm#fr_545) Literally, at any place at which the cutting up\nmay have commended itself to him (to take place). Whether this 'cutting up' is\nhere to be taken figuratively of the burning of the corpse (dahasthane,\nHarisvamin), or of the sacrifice of a barren cow, which may be performed in\nsuch a case, or of both, is not quite clear.\n\n[202:2](sbe44063.htm#fr_546) The construction would rather seem to be,--let\nhim build him (i.e. the dead body) up as a pile amidst his fires.\n\n[202:3](sbe44063.htm#fr_547) The real meaning of ' _s_ umbala' is not known,--\nacc. to the St. Petersb. Dict., some material which readily takes fire, such\nas straw or oakum. Harisvamin takes it in the former sense,--t _ri_ _n_ any\nalpasa _m_ sthitani. Cf. Katy. XXV, 7, 12 (?dried cotton fibre or pods).\n\n[202:4](sbe44063.htm#fr_548) Cf. VII, 5, 2, 21.\n\n[203:1](sbe44063.htm#fr_549) That is, two bowls used for holding the Brahman's\n'fore-portions'; see part i, p. 69, note 4.\n\n[204:1](sbe44063.htm#fr_550) That is, they make everything comfortable for\nhim, make him feel at home:--prak _ri_ sh _t_ am evaina _m_ svarge kalpayanti\npratish _th_ itam; nityasthitatvat pratish _th_ a garhapatya _h_ ; comm.\n\n[205:1](sbe44063.htm#fr_551) According to Katy. XXV, 7, 32, 33 the stone and\nearthen implements are to be thrown into the water; and metal ones may\noptionally be given to a Brahman (or likewise be thrown into the water).\n\n[205:2](sbe44063.htm#fr_552) According to Katy. XXV, 7, 34-37 a sterile cow\nmay he offered prior to (or along with) the burning of the body: in which case\nthe victim is to be killed by a blow behind the ear, and its kidneys are to be\nplaced in the deceased's hands, whilst his face is to be covered with the\nomentum or membrane enclosing the intestines. The final offering referred to\nin the above passage consists of an oblation of ghee.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XII, 6, 1. Sixth Adhyaya. First Brahma _n_ a](sbe44064.htm)\n\n"
