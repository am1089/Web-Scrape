He was born in the South Arcot District, and is\ngenerally believed to have flourished in the first quarter of the ninth\ncentury A.D. He evidently sat loose to caste scruples, for neither of his two\nwives was a Brahman. One was a dancing-girl in the S\xcc\x81aivite temple at\nTiruv\xc4\x81r\xc5\xabr, the modern Tiruvalur in the Tanjore District, while the other was a\nV\xc4\x93\xe1\xb8\xb7\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\xb7a woman of Tiruvottiy\xc5\xabr, now a suburb of Madras. His life seems to have\nbeen no happier than life in polygamy usually is, and to add to his\ndifficulties he sometimes found himself without food for his ladies to eat. He\nfrankly praised God for what he could get, and on the whole his hymns are on a\nlower spiritual plane than those of the first two writers, though there are\nsome which bear the marks of real spiritual experience. Of the sixty-three\nsaints whom S\xcc\x81aivites hold in special honour, Sundarar seems to have been the\nlast, for he sang the praises of the other sixty-two.\n\np. 72 p. 73\n\nSundarar, as our first sample of him shews, was not only later than the two\nauthors whom we have been studying; he was the last of the sixty-three\ncanonized saints of S\xcc\x81aivism. A serious weakness of the religion here shews\nits head. S\xcc\x81iva has his favourites, who can do no wrong. The stanza is given\nin prose, for these names cannot fit into any English metrical line. The first\ntwo will be recognised as names of the poets whose work we have been\nconsidering. N\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\xb7aipp\xc5\x8dv\xc4\x81n is Nandan, the pariah saint. Silandi (= spider) is\nK\xc5\x8dchchenga\xe1\xb9\xad Chola, who figures largely in early Tamil history.\n\n65\\. \xc3\x91\xc4\x81nasambandar and Tirun\xc4\x81vukkarasar, skilled in the Tamil tongue,\nN\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\xb7aipp\xc5\x8dv\xc4\x81n, learned S\xc5\xabdan, S\xc4\x81kkiyan, Silandi, Ka\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb9\x87appan, Ka\xe1\xb9\x87ampullan, these\nmay do wrong, but yet Thou count\'st it right. Hence have I come to the\nsounding anklets of Thy feet, O lord of Tiruppung\xc5\xabr with its pools where\nblossoms many a golden lotus gem.\n\n* * *\n\nTo English ears the metre of the next two verses, which are common favourites,\nhas a curious sound. It is a close reproduction of the Tamil, so close that\nthe tune of the Tamil hymn could be sung to the English words.\n\n66\\. Golden art Thou in Thy form, girt around with the fierce tiger\'s skin,  \nFair shines Thy tangle of hair, crowned with blooms from the kondai\'s bright\ntree,  \nSov\'reign, great jewel art Thou, the red ruby of Mal\xcc\xa4ap\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8di,  \nMother, on Thee, none but Thee, can my heart evermore fixed be.\n\np. 74 p. 75\n\n67\\. Clad in the little loin-cloth, my body with holy ash white,  \nLo I have come to Thy foot; O my head, I beseech Thee, take me.  \nPortion of sword-eyed Um\xc4\x81, Thou red ruby of Mal\xcc\xa4ap\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8di,  \nFriend, \'tis on Thee, none but Thee, can my heart evermore fixed be.\n\n* * *\n\nIs the S\xcc\x81iva manifested at one shrine so distinct from the S\xcc\x81iva manifested at\nanother as to endanger the unity of God? If tradition is right, the danger is\nvery real, for Sundarar was already worshipping at one shrine, Tiruvottiy\xc5\xabr,\nwhen he remembered the lord of \xc4\x80r\xc5\xabr, and deciding to go to him like a\nreturning prodigal, sang this stanza.\n\n68\\. Ah sinful, I have left the path of love and service pure!  \n  Now know I well the meaning of my sickness and my pain.  \n  I will go worship. Fool! how long can I so far remain  \nFrom Him, my pearl, my diamond rare, the king of great \xc4\x80r\xc5\xabr.\n\n* * *\n\nThe joy in God which shines in our next hymn evidently rests on some\nexperience of divine grace which we should have liked to hear more definitely\ndescribed.\n\n69\\. O madman with the moon-crowned hair,  \n  Thou lord of men, thou fount of grace,  \nHow to forget Thee could I bear?  \n  My soul hath aye for Thee a place.  \nVe\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb9\x87ey-nall\xc5\xabr, in "Grace\'s shrine"  \n  South of the stream of Pe\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb9\x87ai, there  \nMy father, I became all thine;  \n  How could I now myself forswear?\n\np. 76 p. 77\n\n70\\. I roamed, a cur, for many days  \n  Without a single thought of Thee,  \nRoamed and grew weary, then such grace  \n  As none could win Thou gayest me.  \nVe\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb9\x87ey-nall\xc5\xabr, in "Grace\'s shrine"  \n  Where bamboos fringe the Pe\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb9\x87ai, there  \nMy Shepherd, I became all thine;  \n  How could I now myself forswear?\n\n71\\. Henceforth for me no birth, no death,  \n  No creeping age, bull-rider mine.  \nSinful and full of lying breath  \n  Am I, hut do Thou mark me Thine.  \nVe\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb9\x87ey-nall\xc5\xabr, in "Graces shrine"  \n  South of the wooded Pe\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb9\x87ai, there  \nMy Master, I became all thine;  \n  How could I now myself forswear?\n\n* * *\n\nThe varying mood of the saint, now joyous and triumphant, now plaintively\nlooking for death, is reflected in the next two verses from one hymn.\n\n72\\. Linked to naught else in life, my mind thinks only of Thy holy feet.  \n  I\'m born anew, from this time forth I pass the way of birth no more.  \nIn Ko\xe1\xb8\x8dumu\xe1\xb8\x8di, lord austere, where wise men Thee with praises greet,  \n  Should I forget Thee, my own tongue \'Hail, S\xcc\x81iva\'! crying, would adore.\n\np. 78 p. 79\n\n73\\. When will the end draw nigh, sense fade, life close, and I the bier\nascend?  \n  This, naught but this, is all my thought. But, lord of speech, Thou light on\nhigh,  \nWhere the bright streams of K\xc4\x81viri to Ko\xe1\xb8\x8dumu\xe1\xb8\x8di coolness lend,  \n  Should I forget Thee, my own tongue to Thee would loud \'Hail, S\xcc\x81iva\' cry.\n\n* * *\n\nGod should deliver His own from death. The appeal here is to the familiar\nstory of Markandeya (see No. 3). Yama is the god of death who gathers in the\nsouls of men.\n\n74\\. The young saint refuge sought from Death;  \n  To save him, Thou grim Death did\'st slay,  \nSuch deeds Thy might accomplisheth,  \n  And I who have beheld them pray  \n"O Father, should dread Yama press  \n  On me, forbid him. \'Tis my slave";  \nDo Thou in green Pung\xc5\xabr confess.  \n  I\'ve reached Thy foot, and Thou can\'st save."\n\n* * *\n\nSundarar is sure that S\xcc\x81iva will understand his perplexities in supplying the\nneeds of his fair ladies. For does not S\xcc\x81iva Himself bear the burden of two\nladies, P\xc4\x81rvati his consort, and Gang\xc4\x81 (lady Ganges) in his hair? Sundarar, in\nthe legend with which these verses are connected, when one of his wives was\nsuffering hunger, miraculously received some uncooked rice from S\xcc\x81iva. This\nwas not enough; to complete the miracle S\xcc\x81iva must remove the rice for him to\n\xc4\x80r\xc5\xabr the abode of his fair one. This too was done in answer to the hymn of\nwhich the next two stanzas are a sample.\n\np. 80 p. 81\n\n75\\. Ever I think but of Thee;  \n  Daily in worship I bow;  \nShe of the sword-piercing eyes,  \n  Leave her not suffering now.  \nK\xc5\x8d\xe1\xb8\xb7ili\'s lord, Thou didst give  \n  Rice in Ku\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8daiy\xc5\xabr this day.  \nNo man to bring it have I,  \n  Bid it be sent me, I pray.\n\n76\\. Thou art half woman Thyself;  \n  Ga\xe1\xb9\x85g\xc4\x81 is in Thy long hair.  \nFull well canst Thou comprehend  \n  Burden of women so fair.  \nKu\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8daiy\xc5\xabr circled with gems,  \n  There didst Thou give rice to-day.  \nSource of all, wonderful one,  \n  Bid it be sent me, I pray.\n\n* * *\n\nThe saint advises his fellow-poets to sing the praises of S\xcc\x81iva rather than\nthe praises of men because they seldom reward the poets. S\xcc\x81iva rewards them\nhere and hereafter. The P\xc4\x81ri mentioned in 78 was a chieftain in the Tamil\ncountry in the early centuries of our era, famed for his liberality.\n\n77\\. Though ye fawn on men of lies,  \n  They to saints will nothing give;  \nSing not them, O poets wise,  \n  But if ye would wealth receive  \nSing the Sire of Puhal\xc5\xabr;  \n  Here your wants will be supplied,  \nPain will flee; there evermore  \n  Ye will kings in heav\'n abide.\n\np. 82 p. 83\n\n78\\. Call the weak by Bhima\'s name,  \n  Style him Arjun with his bow,  \nGive the mean man P\xc4\x81ri\'s fame,  \n  Not a gift will he bestow.  \nSing, O bards, our holy God,  \n  White with ash, in Puhal\xc5\xabr.  \nIn the deathless one\'s abode  \n  Ye shall reign for evermore.\n\n* * *\n\nLife and experience have no value, no reality. God alone is real, the refuge\nfrom the unreal.\n\n79\\. Our life is all unreal,  \n  Its end is only dust,  \nOut of the sea of birth  \n  Come ruin, pain and lust.  \nDelay not to do good  \n  But praise Ket\xc4\x81ram\'s king,  \nWhom Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u and great Brahm  \n  Vainly sought sorrowing.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Manikka V\xc4\x81sahar and his Hymns](htss06.htm)\n\n'
