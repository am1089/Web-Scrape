The Matsya enumerates but four; but the Devi Bhagavata has a more\ncomplete list, and specifies eighteen. They are, 1. The Sanatkumara, 2.\nNarasinha, 3. Naradiya, 4. \xc5\x9aiva, 5. Durvasasa, g. Kapila, 7. Manava, 8.\nAu\xc5\x9bana\xc5\x9ba, 9. Varun\xcc\x81a, 10. Kalika, 11. \xc5\x9aamba, 12. Nandi, 13. Saura, 14.\nPara\xc5\x9bara, 15. \xc3\x81ditya, 16. Mahe\xc5\x9bwara, 17. Bhagavata, 18. Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha. The Matsya\nobserves of the second, that it is named in the Padma Puran\xcc\x81a, and contains\neighteen thousand verses. The Nandi it calls Nanda, and says that Kartikeya\ntells in it the story of Nanda. A rather different list is given in the Reva\nKhan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a; or, 1. Sanatkumara, 2. Narasinha, 3. Nanda, 4. \xc5\x9aivadharma, 5.\nDurvasasa, 6. Bhavishya, related by Narada or Naradiya, 7. Kapila, 8. Manava,\n9. Au\xc5\x9bana\xc5\x9ba, 10. Brahman\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, 11. Varun\xcc\x81a, 12. Kalika, 13. Mahe\xc5\x9bwara, 14.\n\xc5\x9aamba, 15. Saura, 16. Para\xc5\x9bara, 17. Bhagavata, 18. Kaurma. These authorities,\nhowever, are of questionable weight, having in view, no doubt, the pretensions\nof the Devi Bhagavata to be considered as the authentic Bhagavata.\n\nOf these Upa-puran\xcc\x81as few are to be procured. Those in my possession\n\np. lvi\n\nare the \xc5\x9aiva, considered as distinct from the Vayu; the Kalika, and perhaps\none of the Naradiyas, as noticed above. I have also three of the Skandhas of\nthe Devi Bhagavata, which most undoubtedly is not the real Bhagavata,\nsupposing that any Puran\xcc\x81a so named preceded the work of Vopadeva. There can\nbe no doubt that in any authentic list the name of Bhagavata does not occur\namongst the Upa-puran\xcc\x81as: it has been put there to prove that there are two\nworks so entitled, of which the Puran\xcc\x81a is the Devi Bhagavata, the Upa-puran\xcc\x81a\nthe \xc5\x9ari Bhagavata. The true reading should be Bhargava, the Puran\xcc\x81a of Bhrigu;\nand the Devi Bhagavata is not even an Upa-puran\xcc\x81a. It is very questionable if\nthe entire work, which as far as it extends is eminently a Sakta composition,\never had existence.\n\nThe \xc5\x9aiva Upa-puran\xcc\x81a contains about six thousand stanzas, distributed into two\nparts. It is related by Sanatkumara to Vyasa and the Rishis at Naimisharan\xcc\x81ya,\nand its character may be judged of from the questions to which it is a reply.\n"Teach us," said the Rishis, "the rules of worshipping the Linga, and of the\ngod of gods adored under that type; describe to us his various forms, the\nplaces sanctified by him, and the prayers with which he is to be addressed."\nIn answer, Sanatkumara repeats the \xc5\x9aiva Puran\xcc\x81a, containing the birth of\nVishn\xcc\x81u and Brahma; the creation and divisions of the universe; the origin of\nall things from the Linga; the rules of worshipping it and \xc5\x9aiva; the sanctity\nof times, places, and things, dedicated to him; the delusion of Brahma and\nVishn\xcc\x81u by the Linga; the rewards of offering flowers and the like to a Linga;\nrules for various observances in honour of Mahadeva; the mode of practising\nthe Yoga; the glory of Benares and other \xc5\x9aaiva Tirthas; and the perfection of\nthe objects of life by union with Mahe\xc5\x9bwara. These subjects are illustrated in\nthe first part with very few legends; but the second is made up almost wholly\nof \xc5\x9aaiva stories, as the defeat of Tripurasura; the sacrifice of Daksha; the\nbirths of Kartikeya and Gane\xc5\x9ba the sons of \xc5\x9aiva, and Nandi and Bhringariti his\nattendants and others; together with descriptions of Benares and other places\nof pilgrimage, and rules for observing such festivals as the \xc5\x9aivaratri. This\nwork is a \xc5\x9aaiva manual, not a Puran\xcc\x81a.\n\np. lvii\n\nThe Kalika Puran\xcc\x81a contains about nine thousand stanzas in ninety-eight\nchapters, and is the only work of the series dedicated to recommend the\nworship of the bride of \xc5\x9aiva, in one or other of her manifold forms, as\nGirija, Devi, Bhadrakali, Kali, Mahamaya. It belongs therefore to the Sakta\nmodification of Hindu belief, or the worship of the female powers of the\ndeities. The influence of this worship spews itself in the very first pages of\nthe work, which relate the incestuous passion of Brahma for his daughter\nSandhya, in a strain that has nothing analogous to it in the Vayu, Linga, or\n\xc5\x9aiva Puran\xcc\x81as.\n\nThe marriage of \xc5\x9aiva and Parvati is a subject early described, with the\nsacrifice of Daksha, and the death of Sati: and this work is authority for\n\xc5\x9aiva\'s carrying the dead body about the world, and the origin of the\nPithasthanas, or places where the different members of it were scattered, and\nwhere Lingas were consequently erected. A legend follows of the births of\nBhairava and Vetala, whose devotion to different forms of Devi furnishes\noccasion to describe in great detail the rites and formulae of which her\nworship consists, including the chapters on sanguinary sacrifices, translated\nin the Asiatic Researches. Another peculiarity in this work is afforded by\nvery prolix descriptions of a number of rivers and mountains at Kamarupa-\ntirtha in Asam, and rendered holy ground by the celebrated temple of Durga in\nthat country, as Kamak\xc5\x9bhi or Kamakhya. It is a singular, and yet\nuninvestigated circumstance, that Asam, or at least the north-east of Bengal,\nseems to have been in a great degree the source from which the Tantrika and\n\xc5\x9aakta corruptions of the religion of the Vedas and Puran\xcc\x81as proceeded.\n\nThe specification of the Upa-puran\xcc\x81as, whilst it names several of which the\nexistence is problematical, omits other works, bearing the same designation,\nwhich are sometimes met with. Thus in the collection of Col. Mackenzie 82 we\nhave a portion of the Bhargava, and a Mudgala Puran\xcc\x81a, which is probably the\nsame with the Gane\xc5\x9ba Upa-puran\xcc\x81a, cited by Col. Vans Kennedy 83. I have also a\ncopy of the Gane\xc5\x9ba Puran\xcc\x81a, which seems to agree with that of which he speaks;\nthe second portion being entitled the Krid\xcc\x81a Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, in which the pastimes\nof Gane\xc5\x9ba, including\n\np. lviii\n\na variety of legendary matters, are described. The main subject of the work is\nthe greatness of Gane\xc5\x9ba, and prayers and formulae appropriate to him are\nabundantly detailed. It appears to be a work originating with the Ganapatya\nsect, or worshippers of Gane\xc5\x9ba. There is also a minor Puran\xcc\x81a called \xc3\x81di, or\n\'first,\' not included in the list. This is a work, however, of no great extent\nor importance, and is confined to a detail of the sports of the juvenile\nKrishn\xcc\x81a.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[lvii:82](vp023.htm#fr_81) Mackenzie Collection, 1. 50, 51.\n\n[lvii:83](vp023.htm#fr_82) Anc. and Hindu Mythology, p. 251.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Synopsis of the Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a](vp024.htm)\n\n'
