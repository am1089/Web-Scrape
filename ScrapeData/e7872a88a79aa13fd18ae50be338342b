Venkataramanan, [1921], at\nsacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 32\n\n### Hymn to Dakshinamurti.\n\nWho, by virtue of the illusion residing in the self, sees, as in a dream, the\nuniverse as existing outside Himself although (more truly) it exists within\nHimself like the reflection of a city in a mirror, but Who, at the time of the\nawakening, sees naught but His own secondless self,--to that Teacher\nincarnate, the Lord facing the south, be this bow. (1)\n\np. 33\n\nWho, like a magician or like a _yogi_ , manifests, by His own will, this\nuniverse which at the beginning was undifferentiated like the sprout latent in\nthe seed but which subsequently became differentiated under the various\nconditions of space and time induced by illusion,--to that Teacher incarnate,\n* the Lord facing the south, be this bow. (2)\n\nWhose light alone that is the reality shines in things that resemble non-\nentities *; Who directly awakens His devotees by means of the Vedic sentence\n"That thou art"; and Who being realised, there is no more coming hack in this\nocean of _Sams ara_,--to that Teacher incarnate, the Lord facing the south, be\nthis bow. (3)\n\np. 34\n\nWhose consciousness flows out through the eye and other senses like the light\nof a big lamp placed inside a jar with many holes, and (thus) this whole\nuniverse shines solely because He shines, namely, by the consciousness "I\nknow,"--to that Teacher incarnate, the Lord facing the south, be this bow. (4)\n\nDeluded persons who talk much, but who are as ignorant as women and children,\nthe blind and the stupid, understand, as the "I," the body, or the breath, or\nthe senses, or the ever-newly-springing knowledge *, or non-entity.\n\np. 35\n\n[paragraph continues] To Him who dispels this great ignorance induced by the\nexpansive power of illusion *,--to that Teacher incarnate, the Lord facing the\nsouth, be this bow. (5)\n\nWho is the inner self which, under the veil of illusion, like the sun or the\nmoon eclipsed, merely exists \xe2\x80\xa0 in deep sleep owing to the withdrawal of the\nsenses, but which when He wakes, is recognised by Him as "I have slept",--to\nthat Teacher incarnate, the Lord facing the south, be this bow. (6)\n\np. 36\n\nWho reveals to His devotees, by means of the blessed symbol, * His own self\nwhich, for ever, shines within as the "I" unchanging through all the changing\nstates of childhood, youth and old age, waking, dream and sleep, etc.,--to\nthat Teacher incarnate, the Lord facing the south, be this bow. (7)\n\nWho is the supreme self that, dreaming or waking, under the sway of illusion,\nsees the universe under various distinctions such as that of cause and effect,\nowner and owned, pupil and teacher, father and son,--to that Teacher\nincarnate, the Lord facing the south, be this bow. (8)\n\np. 37\n\nWhose eightfold form alone, namely, earth, water, fire, air; ether, sun, moon\nand soul, manifests itself as this sentient and non-sentient universe; than\nWhom, supreme and infinite, naught else is perceived by the seekers of\nreality,--to that Teacher incarnate, the Lord facing the south, be this bow.\n(9)\n\nSince, in this hymn, the identity of the self with the universe has been made\nclear, by listening to it, by understanding its meaning, by meditating on it,\nand by teaching it to others, one will acquire the supreme faculty of\n[identity](errata.htm#0) with the universe, together with\n\np. 38\n\nthe overlordship of nature and the eightfold divine faculty. * (10)\n\n\n\n\n\nThus ends the hymn to Dakshinamurti.\n\n____\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[33:*](wos05.htm#fr_32) Because they have no reality of their own.
