 \nWhy are the drum and tabour mute?  \nWhy is the music of the lute  \nThat woke responsive to the quill,  \nLoved by the happy, hushed and still?  \nMy boding spirit gathers hence  \nDire sins of awful consequence,  \nAnd omens, crowding on my sight,  \nWeigh down my soul with wild affright  \nScarce shall I find my friends who dwell  \nHere in Ayodhya safe and well:  \nFor surely not without a cause  \nThis crushing dread my soul o'erawes.  \n   Heart sick, dejected, every sense  \nConfused by terror's influence,  \nOn to the town he quickly swept  \nWhich King Ikshvaku's children kept.  \nHe passed through Vaijayanta's gate,  \nWith weary steeds, disconsolate.  \nAnd all who near their station held,  \nHis escort. crying Victory, swelled,  \nWith heart distracted still he bowed  \nFarewell to all the following crowd,  \nTurned to the driver and began  \nTo question thus the weary man:.  \n'Why was I brought, O free from blame,  \nSo fast, unknown for what I came?  \nYet fear of ill my heart appals,  \nAnd all my wonted courage falls.  \nFor I have heard in days gone by  \nThe changes seen when monarchs die;  \nAnd all those signs. O charioteer,  \nI see today surround me here:  \nEach kinsman's house looks dark and grim,  \nNo hand delights to keep it trim:  \nThe beauty vanished. and the pride,  \nThe doors, unkept, stand open wide.  \nNo morning rites are offered there,  \nNo grateful incense loads the air,  \nAnd all therein, with brows o'ercast,  \nSit joyless on the ground and fast.  \nTheir lovely chaplets dry and dead,  \n\np. 180  \n\nTheir courts unswept, with dust o'erspread,  \nThe temples of the Gods to-day  \nNo more look beautiful and gay.  \nNeglected stands each holy shrine,  \nEach image of a Lord divine.  \nNo shop where flowery wreaths are sold  \nIs bright and busy as of old.  \nThe women and the men I mark  \nAbsorbed in fancies dull and dark,  \nTheir gloomy eyes with tears bedewed,  \nA poor afflicted multitude.'  \n\nHis mind oppressed with woe and dread,  \nThus Bharat to his driver said,  \nViewed the dire signs Ayodhya showed,  \nAnd onward to the palace rode.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[178:1](ry149.htm#fr_348) 'The S'atadru, 'the hundred-channeled' \\--the\nZaradrus of Ptolemy, Hesydrus of Pliny--is the Sutlej.'
