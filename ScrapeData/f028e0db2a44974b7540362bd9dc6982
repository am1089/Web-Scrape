THE K\xc5\xaaRMA OR TORTOISE AVAT\xc4\x80RA.\n\nThis incarnation was necessitated by the fact that the gods were in danger of\nlosing their authority over the demons. In their distress they applied to\nVishnu for help, who told them to churn the sea of milk that they might\nprocure the _Amrita_ , or water of life, by which they would be made strong,\nand promised to become the\n\np. 142\n\ntortoise on which the mountain Mandara as a churning stick should rest. As a\nfull account of this operation has been already given when describing Lakshmi,\nwho was one of its chief products, there is no necessity to repeat it here. A\nfew additional particulars will be found in the following extract from the\n"Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na:"-- *\n\n"Hari having been entreated to help the gods, thus spoke: \'I will restore your\nstrength. Do you act as I enjoin. Let all the gods and asuras cast all sorts\nof medicinal herbs into the sea of milk, and together churn the ocean for\nambrosia, depending on my aid. To secure the assistance of the daityas, you\nmust be at peace with them, and engage to give them an equal share of your\nassociated toil; promising them that by drinking of the amrita . . . they\nshall become mighty and immortal. I will take care that the enemies of the\ngods shall not partake of the precious draught; they shall only share in the\nlabour.\'"\n\nThe gods entered into an arrangement with the asuras, and together they made\nthe necessary preparations. " The assembled gods were stationed by Krishna at\nthe tail of the serpent Vasuki (the churning rope), and the daityas and\nd\xc4\x81navas at its head and neck. Scorched by the flames emitted from his inflated\nhood, the demons were shorn of their glory; whilst the clouds, driven by his\nbreath towards his tail, refreshed the gods by vivifying showers. In the midst\nof the milky sea, Hari himself, in the form of a tortoise, served as a pivot\nfor the mountain, as it was whirled around. The holder of the mace and discus\nwas present in other forms amongst the gods and demons, and assisted to drag\nthe monarch of the serpent race; and in another vast body sat upon\n\np. 143\n\nthe summit of the mountain. With one portion of his energy, unseen by gods and\ndemons, he sustained the serpent king; and with another infused vigour unto\nthe gods."\n\n[![THE K\xc5\xaaRMA AVAT\xc4\x80RA.](tn/14300.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/14300.jpg)  \nTHE K\xc5\xaaRMA AVAT\xc4\x80RA.  \n\nSuch is the account of this incarnation of Vishnu as taught by the Pur\xc4\x81nas;\nbut in the earlier books, where the probable origin of this legend is found,\nit is Brahm\xc4\x81, and not Vishnu, that is said to have assumed the form\n\np. 144\n\nof a tortoise. In the "Satapatha Br\xc4\x81hmana" are these words: "Having assumed\nthe form of a tortoise, Praj\xc4\x81pati (Brahm\xc4\x81) created offspring. That which he\ncreated, he made; " hence the word K\xc5\xabrma. Kasyapa means tortoise; hence men\nsay, "All creatures are descendants of Kasyapa. This tortoise is the same as\nAditya." As the worship of Brahm\xc4\x81 became less popular, whilst that of Vishnu\nincreased in its attraction, the names, attributes, and works of the one deity\nappear to have been transferred to the other.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[142:*](hmvp20.htm#fr_146) Page 73.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 3.
