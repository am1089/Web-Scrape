For there is a special statement, i.e. the text\nsays that when the soul has become rice or grain or the like, the passing out\nof that stage is beset with difficulties. From this we infer that as there is\nno such statement concerning the earlier stages, the soul stays at each of\nthem for a short time only.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'the not\nvery long time.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 24.
