To him who was thus overwhelmed with pity and sorrowing, and whose eyes\nwere dimmed with tears, Madhusudana spoke these words: 1\n\np. 28\n\nThe Blessed Lord said:\n\n2\\. In such a crisis, whence comes upon thee, O Arjuna, this dejection, un-\nAryalike, disgraceful and contrary to the attainment of heaven? 2\n\n3\\. Yield not to unmanliness, O son of Pritha! Ill doth it become thee. Cast\noff this mean faint-heartedness and arise, O scorcher of thine enemies!\n\np. 29\n\nArjuna said:\n\n4\\. --But how can I, in battle, O slayer of Madhu, fight with arrows against\nBhishma and Drona, who are rather worthy to be worshipped, O destroyer of\nfoes!\n\np. 30\n\n5\\. Surely it would be better even to eat the bread of beggary in this life\nthan to slay these great-souled masters. But if I kill them, even in this\nworld, all my enjoyment of wealth and desires will be stained with blood. 5\n\n6\\. And indeed I can scarcely tell which will be better, that we should\nconquer them, or that they should conquer us. The very sons of Dhritarashtra,\n--after slaying whom we should not care to live,--stand facing us.\n\np. 31\n\n7\\. With my nature overpowered by weak commiseration, with a mind in confusion\nabout duty, I supplicate Thee. Say decidedly what is good for me. I am Thy\ndisciple. Instruct me who have taken refuge in Thee. 7\n\np. 32\n\n8\\. I do not see anything to remove this sorrow which blasts my senses, even\nwere I to obtain unrivalled and flourishing dominion over the earth, and\nmastery over the gods.\n\np. 33\n\nSanjaya said:\n\n9\\. Having spoken thus to the Lord of the senses, Gudakesha, the scorcher of\nfoes, said to Govinda, "I shall not fight," and became silent. 9\n\np. 34\n\n10\\. To him who was sorrowing in the midst of the two armies, Hrishikesha, as\nif smiling, O descendant of Bharata! spoke these words. 10\n\nThe Blessed Lord said:\n\n11\\. Thou hast been mourning for them who should not be mourned for. Yet thou\nspeakest words of wisdom. The (truly) wise grieve neither for the living nor\nthe dead. 11\n\np. 35\n\n12\\. It is not that I have never existed, nor thou, nor these kings. Nor is it\nthat we shall cease to exist in the future. 12\n\n13\\. As are childhood, youth, and old age, in this body, to the embodied soul,\nso\n\np. 36\n\nalso is the attaining of another body. Calm souls are not deluded thereat. 13\n\n14\\. Notions of heat and cold, of pain and pleasure, are born, O son of Kunti,\nonly of the contact of the senses with their objects. They have a beginning\nand an end. They are impermanent in their nature. Bear them patiently, O\ndescendant of Bharata. 14\n\np. 37\n\n15\\. That calm man who is the same in pain and pleasure, whom these cannot\ndisturb, alone is able, O great amongst men, to attain to immortality. 15\n\np. 38\n\n16\\. The unreal never is. The Real never is not. Men possessed of the\nknowledge of the Truth fully know both these. 16\n\n17\\. That by which all this is pervaded,--That know for certain to be\nindestructible. None has the power to destroy this Immutable. 17\n\np. 39\n\n18\\. Of this indwelling Self, the ever-changeless, the indestructible, the\nillimitable,--these bodies are said to have an end. Fight therefore, O\ndescendant of Bharata. 18\n\np. 40\n\n19\\. He who takes the Self to be the slayer, he who takes It to be the slain,\nneither of these knows. It does not slay, nor is It slain. 19\n\n20\\. This in never born, nor does It die. It is not that not having been It\nagain comes into being. (Or according to another view: It is not that having\nbeen It again ceases to be). This is unborn, eternal, changeless, ever-Itself.\nIt is not killed when the body is killed. 20\n\np. 41\n\n21\\. He that knows This to be indestructible, changeless, without birth, and\nimmutable, how is he, O son of Pritha, to slay or cause another to slay? 21\n\np. 42\n\n22\\. Even as a man casts off worn-out clothes, and puts on others which are\nnew, so the embodied casts off worn-out bodies, and enters into others which\nare new. 22\n\n23\\. This (Self), weapons cut not; This, fire burns not; This, water wets not;\nand This, wind dries not.\n\np. 43\n\n24\\. This Self cannot be cut, nor burnt, nor wetted, nor dried. Changeless,\nall-pervading, unmoving, immovable, the Self is eternal.\n\n25\\. This (Self) is said to be unmanifested, unthinkable, and unchangeable.\nTherefore, knowing This to be such, thou oughtest not to mourn. 25\n\np. 44\n\n26\\. But if thou shouldst take This to have constant birth and death, even in\nthat case, O mighty-armed, thou oughtest not to mourn for This. 26\n\n27\\. Of that which is born, death is certain, of that which is dead, birth is\ncertain. Over the unavoidable, therefore, thou oughtest not to grieve. 27\n\np. 45\n\n28\\. All beings are unmanifested in their beginning, O Bharata, manifested in\ntheir middle state and unmanifested again in their end. What is there then to\ngrieve about? 28\n\np. 46\n\n29\\. Some look upon the Self as marvellous. Others speak of It as wonderful.\nOthers again hear of It as a wonder. And still others, though hearing, do not\nunderstand It at all. 29\n\np. 47\n\n30\\. This, the Indweller in the bodies of all, is ever indestructible, O\ndescendant of Bharata. Wherefore thou oughtest not to mourn for any creature.\n30\n\n31\\. Looking at thine own Dharma, also, thou oughtest not to waver, for there\nis nothing higher for a Kshatriya than a righteous war. 31\n\np. 48\n\n32\\. Fortunate certainly are the Kshatriyas, O son of Pritha, who are called\nto fight in such a battle, that comes unsought as an open gate to heaven. 32\n\n33\\. But if thou refusest to engage in this righteous warfare, then,\nforfeiting thine own Dharma and honour, thou shalt incur sin.\n\np. 49\n\n34\\. The world also will ever hold thee in reprobation. To the honoured,\ndisrepute is surely worse than death. 34\n\n35\\. The great chariot-warriors * will believe that thou hast withdrawn from\nthe battle through fear. And thou wilt be lightly esteemed by them who have\nthought much of thee.\n\np. 50\n\n36\\. Thine enemies also, cavilling at thy great prowess, will say of thee\nthings that are not to be uttered. What could be more intolerable than this?\n\n37\\. Dying thou gainest heaven; conquering thou enjoyest the earth. Therefore,\nO son of Kunti, arise, resolved to fight.\n\np. 51\n\n38\\. Having made pain and pleasure, gain and loss, conquest and defeat, the\nsame, engage thou then in battle. So shalt thou incur no sin. 38\n\n39\\. The wisdom of Self-realisation has been declared unto thee. Hearken thou\nnow to the wisdom of Yoga, endued with which, O son of Pritha, thou shalt\nbreak through the bonds of Karma. 39\n\np. 52\n\n40\\. In this, there is no waste of the unfinished attempt, nor is there\nproduction of contrary results. Even very little of this Dharma protects from\nthe great terror. 52\n\np. 53\n\n41\\. In this, O scion of Kuru, there is but a single one-pointed\ndetermination. The purposes of the undecided are innumerable and many-\nbranching. 53\n\np. 54\n\n42-44. O Partha, no set determination is formed in the minds of those that are\ndeeply attached to pleasure and power, and whose discrimination is stolen away\nby the flowery words of the unwise, who are full of desires and look upon\nheaven as their highest goal and who, taking pleasure in the panegyric words\nof the Vedas, declare that there is nothing else. Their (flowery) words are\nexuberant with various specific, rites as the means to pleasure and power and\nare the causes of\n\np. 55\n\n[paragraph continues] (new) births as the result of their works (performed\nwith desire). 42\n\n45\\. The Vedas deal with the three Gunas. Be thou free, O Arjuna, from the\ntriad of the Gunas, free from the pairs of opposites, ever-balanced, free from\n(the thought of) getting and keeping, and established in the Self. 45\n\np. 56\n\n46\\. To the Brahmana who has known the Self, all the Vedas are of so much use\nas a reservoir is, when there is a flood everywhere. 46\n\np. 57\n\n47\\. Thy right is to work only; but never to the fruits thereof. Be thou not\nthe producer of the fruits of (thy) actions; neither let thy attachment be\ntowards inaction. 47\n\np. 58\n\n48\\. Being steadfast in Yoga, Dhananjaya, perform actions, abandoning\nattachment, remaining unconcerned as regards success and failure. This\nevenness. of mind (in regard to success and failure) is known as Yoga.\n\n49\\. Work (with desire) is verily far inferior to that performed with the mind\nundisturbed by thoughts of results. O\n\np. 59\n\n[paragraph continues] Dhananjaya, seek refuge in this evenness of mind.\nWretched are they who act for results.\n\n50\\. Endued with this evenness of mind, one frees oneself in this life, alike\nfrom vice and virtue. Devote thyself, therefore, to this Yoga. Yoga is the\nvery dexterity of work. 50\n\np. 60\n\n51\\. The wise, possessed of this evenness of mind, abandoning the fruits of\ntheir actions, freed for ever from the fetters of birth, go to that state\nwhich is beyond all evil.\n\n52\\. When thy intellect crosses beyond the taint of illusion, then shalt thou\nattain to indifference, regarding things heard and things yet to be heard. 52\n\np. 61\n\n53\\. When thy intellect, tossed about by the conflict of opinions--has become\nimmovable and firmly established in the Self, then thou shalt attain Self-\nrealisation.\n\nArjuna said:\n\n54\\. What, O Keshava, is the description of the man of steady wisdom, merged\nin Samadhi? How (on the other hand) does the man of steady wisdom speak, how\nsit, how walk? 54\n\np. 62\n\nThe Blessed Lord said:\n\n55\\. When a man completely casts away, O Partha, all the desires of the mind,\nsatisfied in the Self alone by the Self, then is he said to be one of steady\nwisdom. 55\n\np. 63\n\n56\\. He whose mind is not shaken by adversity, who does not hanker after\nhappiness, who has become free from affection, fear, and wrath, is indeed the\nMuni of steady wisdom. 63\n\n57\\. He who is everywhere unattached, not pleased at receiving good, nor vexed\nat evil, his wisdom is fixed. 57\n\np. 64\n\n58\\. When also, like the tortoise its limbs, he can completely withdraw the\nsenses from their objects, then his wisdom becomes steady. 58\n\n59\\. Objects fall away from the abstinent man, leaving the longing behind. But\nhis longing also ceases, who sees the Supreme. 59\n\np. 65\n\n60\\. The turbulent senses, O son of Kunti, do violently snatch away the mind\nof even a wise man, striving after perfection.\n\n61\\. The steadfast, having controlled them all, sits focussed on Me as the\nSupreme. His wisdom is steady, whose senses are under control.\n\np. 66\n\n62\\. Thinking of objects, attachment to them is formed in a man. From\nattachment longing, and from longing anger grows.\n\n63\\. From anger comes delusion, and from delusion loss of memory. From loss of\nmemory comes the ruin of discrimination, and from the ruin of discrimination\nhe perishes. 63\n\np. 67\n\n64\\. But the self-controlled man, moving among objects with senses under\nrestraint, and free from attraction and aversion, attains to tranquillity. 64\n\n65\\. In tranquillity, all sorrow is destroyed. For the intellect of him who is\ntranquil-minded, is soon established in firmness. 65\n\np. 68\n\n66\\. No knowledge (of the Self) has the unsteady. Nor has he meditation. To\nthe unmeditative there is no peace. And how can one without peace have\nhappiness?\n\n67\\. For, the mind which follows in the wake of the wandering senses, carries\naway his discrimination, as a wind (carries away from its course) a boat on\nthe waters.\n\np. 69\n\n68\\. Therefore, O mighty-armed, his knowledge is steady, whose senses are\ncompletely restrained from their objects. 68\n\n69\\. That which is night to all beings, in that the self-controlled man wakes.\nThat in which all beings wake, is night to the Self-seeing Muni. 69\n\np. 70\n\n70\\. As into the ocean,--brimful, and still,--flow the waters, even so the\nMuni into whom enter all desires, he, and not the desirer of desires, attains\nto peace. 70\n\np. 71\n\n71\\. That man who lives devoid of longing, abandoning all desires, without the\nsense of \'I\' and \'mine,\' he attains to peace. 71\n\n72\\. This is to have one\'s being in Brahman, O son of Pritha. None, attaining\nto this, becomes deluded. Being established therein, even at the end of life,\na man attains to oneness with Brahman.\n\nThe end of second chapter, designated The Way of Knowledge.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[27:1](sbg07.htm#fr_16) _Overwhelmed with pity:_ Not Arjuna, but Arjuna\'s\nfeeling was master of the situation.\n\n[28:2](sbg07.htm#fr_17) Mark with what contempt Krishna regards Arjuna\'s\nattitude of weakness masked by religious expression!\n\n[30:5](sbg07.htm#fr_18) _i.e._ even in this world I shall be in hell.\n\n[31:7](sbg07.htm#fr_19) _Dharma_ is the _ness_ , the law of the inmost\nconstitution of a thing. The primary meaning of Dharma is not virtue or\nreligion, but that is only its secondary significance. Fighting in a just\ncause is the religious duty or Dharma of a Kshatriya, while the same is a sin\nto a Brahmana, because it is contrary to the law of his being. Working out\none\'s Karma according to the law of one\'s own being is p. 32 therefore the\nDharma or religion or way to salvation of an individual. The cloud of Karma\nhides the Self-Sun from view. The means which exhausts this cloud without\nadding to it and thus helps in one\'s Self-restoration is one\'s Dharma.\n\n_Thy disciple:_ Until this declaration has been made, the Master may not give\nthe highest knowledge.\n\n[33:9](sbg07.htm#fr_20) The object of Sanjaya in using these names is to\nremind Dhritarashtra--who may naturally be a little elated at the prospect of\nArjuna\'s not fighting --that this is only a temporary weakness, since by the\npresence of the Lord of the senses all ignorance must eventually be dispelled.\nArjuna\'s own nature also is devoid of darkness. Is he not the conqueror of\nsleep, and the terror of foes?\n\n[34:10](sbg07.htm#fr_21) _Smiling_ --to drown Arjuna in the ocean of shame.\nKrishna\'s smile at Arjuna\'s sorrow is like the lightning that plays over the\nblack monsoon cloud. The rain bursts forth, and the thirsty earth is\nsaturated. It is the smile of the coming illumination.\n\n[34:11](sbg07.htm#fr_22) _Words of wisdom:_ Vide I. 35-44.\n\n[35:12](sbg07.htm#fr_23) Of course Krishna here does not mean that the body is\nimmortal, but refers to the true Self, behind all bodies.\n\n[36:13](sbg07.htm#fr_24) According to this, the continuity of the ego is no\nmore interrupted by death than by the passing of childhood into youth and\nyouth into old age in this body.\n\n_Calm souls:_ Those who have become calm by Self-realisation.\n\n[36:14](sbg07.htm#fr_25) _They have a beginning and an end:_ as distinguished\nfrom the Permanent Self. The more one is able to identify oneself with the\nPermanent p. 37 Self, the less one is affected by the agreeable and\ndisagreeable conditions of life.\n\n_Impermanent in their nature:_ That is, the same object which gives pleasure\nat one moment gives pain at another, and so on.\n\n[37:15](sbg07.htm#fr_26) Thus perfect sameness amidst the ills of life means\nfull and unbroken consciousness of our oneness with the Immortal Self. Thus is\nimmortality attained.\n\n[38:16](sbg07.htm#fr_27) _Unreal:_ _Real:_ The determination of the nature of\nthe Real is the quest of all philosophy. Sri Krishna here states that a thing\nwhich never remains the same for any given period is unreal, and that the Real\non the other hand is always the same. The whole of the phenomenal world,\ntherefore, must be unreal, because in it no one state endures for even an\ninfinitesimal division of time. And that which takes note of this incessant\nchange, and is therefore itself changeless,--the Atman, Consciousness,--is the\nReal.\n\n[38:17](sbg07.htm#fr_28) p. 39 _That by which all this is pervaded_ , _i.e._\nHe that pervades all this as the Witness.\n\n[39:18](sbg07.htm#fr_29) Arjuna\'s grief which deters him from his duty of\nfighting against the Kauravas is born of ignorance as to the true nature of\nthe Soul. Hence Sri Bhagavan\'s strong and repeated attempts to illumine him on\nthe subject.\n\n[40:19](sbg07.htm#fr_30) Cf. Katha Up. I. ii. 19-20.\n\n[40:20](sbg07.htm#fr_31) p. 41 This sloka refers in the sense of denial to the\nsix kinds of modification inherent in matter: birth, subsistence, growth,\ntransformation, decay, and death.\n\n[41:21](sbg07.htm#fr_32) _How is he to slay?_ --referring to Arjuna. _To cause\nanother to slay_ --referring to Krishna\'s own part.\n\n[42:22](sbg07.htm#fr_33) As one only puts off the old, when one already\npossesses the new garment, so the embodied is already entering a new body in\nthe act of leaving this. The Upanishad compares this to the movement of a\nleech, which has already established a new foothold before leaving the old.\n\n[43:25](sbg07.htm#fr_34) This Self is infinite and partless, so can be neither\nsubject nor object of any action.\n\n[44:26](sbg07.htm#fr_35) Krishna here, for the sake of argument, takes up the\nmaterialistic supposition, and shows that even if the Self were impermanent,\nsorrow ought to be destroyed, since in that case there would be no hereafter,\nno sin, and no hell.\n\n[44:27](sbg07.htm#fr_36) This sloka concerns only those who are not yet free.\nSo long as there is desire, birth and death are inevitable.\n\n_Therefore thou oughtest not to grieve:_ Since you cannot control the\ninevitable and preserve the bodies of your relations, work out your own Karma\nand go beyond both birth and death.\n\n[45:28](sbg07.htm#fr_37) _Beings:_ In their relationships as sons and friends,\nwho are mere combinations of material elements, correlated as causes and\neffects.\n\nThe idea here is that that which has no existence in the beginning and in the\nend, must be merely illusory in the interim, and should not therefore be\nallowed to have any influence upon the mind.\n\n[46:29](sbg07.htm#fr_38) The sloka may also be interpreted in the sense that\nthose who see, hear and speak of the Self are wonderful men, because their\nnumber is so small. It is not therefore remarkable that you should mourn,\nbecause the Atman is so difficult to comprehend.\n\n[47:30](sbg07.htm#fr_39) Krishna here returns to His own point of view.\n\n[47:31](sbg07.htm#fr_40) That is to say, it is the duty of a Kshatriya to\nfight in the interest of his country, people and religion.\n\n[48:32](sbg07.htm#fr_41) The Shastras say that if a Kshatriya fighting for a\nrighteous cause falls in the battle-field, he at once go to heaven.\n\n[49:34](sbg07.htm#fr_42) The present argument,--slokas 33-36, assumes that the\ncause in hand is already proved to be right. Hence it could only be from\ncowardice that Arjuna could abandon it. Even a hero may be weakened by the\nstirring of his deepest emotions.\n\n[49:*](sbg07.htm#fr_43) Vide commentary I. 6.\n\n[51:38](sbg07.htm#fr_44) It is always the desire for one of the pairs of\nopposites that binds. When an act is done without attachment either for itself\nor its fruit, then Karma can be worked out without adding to its store, and\nthis leads to Freedom.\n\n[51:39](sbg07.htm#fr_45) _Yoga:_ --Karma Yoga, or that plan of conduct which\nsecures the working out of past Karma; non-accumulation of new; and the\nstriving for Self-realisation with the whole of the will. In this discipline,\none\'s sole object in life is Self-realisation; hence no importance is attached\nto anything else. Thus all actions are performed without attachment, p. 52 or\ncare for results. So no new Karma is made: only the already accumulated is\nexhausted. And at the same time, the whole will is left free to devote itself\nto the achievement of Self-realisation alone.\n\nIn the preceding slokas, 11-25, Krishna has given the point of view of the\nhighest knowledge, the ancient Brahmajnana. In the 25th and 27th we have a\npurely materialistic standpoint. Slokas 28 to 37 give the attitude of a man of\nthe world. In the 38th we have an anticipation of the Yoga. And in what is to\nfollow, we have Sri Krishna\'s own contribution to the philosophy of life.\n\n[52:52](sbg07.htm#fr_46) _Waste of the unfinished attempt:_ A religious rite\nor ceremony performed for a definite object, if left uncompleted, is wasted,\nlike a house unroofed which is neither serviceable nor enduring. In Karma\nYoga, however, that is, action and worship performed p. 53 without desire,\nthis law does not apply, for every effort results in immediate purification of\nthe heart. _Production of contrary results:_ In worship for an object, any\nimperfection in the process produces positive loss instead of gain. As in\ncases of sickness, the non-use of the right medicine results in death. _The\ngreat terror:_ Being caught in the wheel of birth and death.\n\n[53:53](sbg07.htm#fr_47) In Karma Yoga, the one goal is Self-realisation. _The\nundecided_ (that is, about the highest), naturally devote themselves to lower\nideals, no one of which can satisfy. Thus they pass from plan to plan.\n\n[55:42](sbg07.htm#fr_48) Samadhi has been rendered into \'mind\' in the above.\nThe generally accepted significance of the term (absorption in God-\nconsciousness produced by deep meditation) would give an equally consistent\nand happy meaning: Persons attached to pleasure and power cannot have perfect\nsteadiness of mind in divine meditation.\n\n_Panegyric words of the Vedas:_ The Karma Kanda or the sacrificial portion of\nthe Vedas which lays down specific rules for specific actions and their\nfruits, and extols these latter unduly. _Nothing else:_ Beyond the heavenly\nenjoyments procurable by the sacrificial rites of the Vedas.\n\n[55:45](sbg07.htm#fr_49) _The Vedas deal with etc.:_ That is to say, the Vedas\ntreat of relativity. _Pairs of opposites:_ Dvandva, all correlated ideas and\nsensations, _e.g._ , good and bad, pleasure and pain, heat and cold, light and\ndarkness, etc.\n\n_Guna_ is a technical term of the Sankhya philosophy: also used in the same\nsense by the Vedanta. Prakriti or Nature is constituted of three Gunas; Sattva\n(equilibrium), Rajas (attraction), Tamas (inertia). Prakriti _is_ the three\nGunas, _not_ that she _has_ them. Guna is wrongly translated as quality; it is\nsubstance as well as quality, matter _and_ force. Wherever there is name and\nform, there is Guna. Guna also means a rope, that which binds.\n\n[56:46](sbg07.htm#fr_50) A man possessed of Self-knowledge has no need\nwhatever of the Vedas. This does not, however, mean that the Vedas are\nuseless; only to the knower of Brahman they have no value, as the transient p.\n57 pleasures derivable from them are comprehended in the infinite bliss of\nSelf-knowledge.\n\n[57:47](sbg07.htm#fr_51) _Be thou not the producer, etc.:_ That is, do not\nwork with any desire for results, for actions produce fruits or bondage only\nif they are performed with desire.\n\nKarma primarily means action, but a much profounder meaning has come to be\nattached to this word. It means the destiny forged by one in one\'s past\nincarnation or present: the store of tendencies, impulses, characteristics,\nand habits laid by, which determines the future embodiment, environment and\nthe whole of one\'s organisation.\n\nAnother meaning of Karma often used in reference to one\'s caste or position in\nlife, is duty, the course of conduct which one ought to follow in pursuance of\nthe tendencies which one acquired in p. 58 one\'s past, with a view to work\nthem out and regain the pristine purity of the Self.\n\n[59:50](sbg07.htm#fr_52) _Alike from vice and virtue:_ A follower of Karma\nYoga can have no personal motive for any action. Our action without motive\nbecomes colourless, loses its character of vice or virtue.\n\n_Dexterity of work:_ It is the nature of work to produce bondage. Karma Yoga\nis the dexterity of work because it not only robs work of its power to bind,\nbut also transforms it into an efficient means of freedom.\n\n[60:52](sbg07.htm#fr_53) _The taint of illusion:_ the identifying of the Self\nwith the non-Self, the ego.\n\n[61:54](sbg07.htm#fr_54) Arjuna is asking, (1) what is the state of the mind\nof the man of realisation when in Samadhi? and (2) how is its influence shown\nin his conduct when out of it? p. 62\n\n_Steady wisdom:_ Settled conviction of one\'s identity with Brahman gained by\ndirect realisation.\n\n[62:55](sbg07.htm#fr_55) This answers the first part of Arjuna\'s question.\n\n[63:63](sbg07.htm#fr_56) This and the following two slokas answer the second\npart of Arjuna\'s question, as to the conduct of one of perfect realisation.\n\n_Muni:_ Man of meditation.\n\n[63:57](sbg07.htm#fr_57) _Not pleased etc.:_ consequently he does not praise\nor blame. This is an answer to the query: "How does he speak?"\n\n[64:58](sbg07.htm#fr_58) _Withdraw the senses:_ bring the mind back upon the\nSelf from all sense-objects. This is known as Pratyahara in Yoga.\n\nTo explain the sloka more fully: a man of the highest realisation can, at any\nmoment, shake himself clear of all impressions of the sense-world and go into\nSamadhi, with the ease and naturalness of a tortoise drawing its limbs within\nitself.\n\n[64:59](sbg07.htm#fr_59) _Abstinent man:_ An unillumined person abstaining\nfrom sense-pleasure for penance, or because of physical incapacity.\n\n[66:63](sbg07.htm#fr_60) A beautiful image appears. The tendency of the mind\nis to repeat it. Then, if the image is allowed to recur, a liking grows. With\nthe growth of liking the wish to come close, to possess, appears. Any obstacle\nto this produces wrath. The impulse of anger throws the mind into confusion,\nwhich casts a veil over the lessons of wisdom learnt by past experience.
