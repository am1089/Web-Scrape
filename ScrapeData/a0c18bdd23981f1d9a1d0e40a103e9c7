Some also by proceeding according to their liking (evince their disregard\nof anything but knowledge).\n\nMoreover some who know, having obtained the intuition of the fruit of\nknowledge, express, in reliance thereon, the purposelessness of the means of\nall other results, viz. by proceeding according to their liking (and\nabandoning those means). A scriptural text of the Va _g_ asaneyins runs as\nfollows: 'Knowing this the people of old did not wish for offspring. What\nshall we do with offspring, they said, we who have this Self and this world'\n(B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 22). And that the fruit of knowledge, being present to\nintuition, does not manifest itself at a later time only as the fruits of\nactions do, we have explained more than once. From this also it follows that\nknowledge is not subordinate to action, and that the scriptural statements as\nto the fruit of knowledge cannot be taken in any but their true sense.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 16](sbe38225.htm)\n\n"
