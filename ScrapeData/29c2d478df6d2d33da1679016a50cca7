Of those who have a certain office there is subsistence (of their works)\nas long as the office lasts.\n\nWe do not maintain that all those who have reached true knowledge divest\nthemselves at the time of death of all their good and evil works; we limit our\nview to those who immediately after death attain to moving on the path, the\nfirst stage of which is light. Persons like Vasish _th_ a, on the other hand,\nwho are entrusted with certain offices, do not immediately after death attain\nto moving on the path beginning with light, since the duties undertaken by\nthem are not completely accomplished. In the case of beings of this kind, who\nowing to particular deeds have been appointed to particular offices, the\neffect of the works which gave rise to the office does not pass away before\nthose offices are completely accomplished; for the effect of a work is\nexhausted only through the complete enjoyment of its result. In the case of\nthose persons, therefore, the effects of the works which gave rise to their\noffice continue to exist as long as the office itself, and hence they do not\nafter death enter on the path beginning with light.--Here terminates the\nadhikara _n_ a of 'passing away.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 32.
