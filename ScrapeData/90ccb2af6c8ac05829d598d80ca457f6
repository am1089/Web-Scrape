Such Nescience, he says, must necessarily be admitted, firstly on the\nground of scriptural texts, such as \'Hidden by what is untrue\' ( _Kh_. Up.\nVIII, 3, 2), and secondly because otherwise the oneness of the individual\nsouls with Brahman--which is taught by texts such as \'Thou are that\'--cannot\nbe established. This Nescience is neither \'being,\' because in that case it\ncould not be the object of erroneous cognition (bhrama) and sublation (badha);\nnor is it \'non-being,\' because in that case it could not be the object of\napprehension and sublation 1. Hence orthodox Philosophers declare\n\np. 103\n\nthat this Nescience falls under neither of these two opposite categories.\n\nNow this theory of Nescience is altogether untenable. In the first place we\nask, \'What is the substrate of this Nescience which gives rise to the great\nerror of plurality of existence?\' You cannot reply \'the individual soul\'; for\nthe individual soul itself exists in so far only as it is fictitiously\nimagined through Nescience. Nor can you say \'Brahman\'; for Brahman is nothing\nbut self-luminous intelligence, and hence contradictory in nature to\nNescience, which is avowedly sublated by knowledge.\n\n\'The highest Brahman has knowledge for its essential nature: if Nescience,\nwhich is essentially false and to be terminated by knowledge, invests Brahman,\nwho then will be strong enough to put an end to it?\'\n\n\'What puts an end to Nescience is the knowledge that Brahman is pure\nknowledge!\'--\'Not so, for that knowledge also is, like Brahman, of the nature\nof light, and hence has no power to put an end to Nescience.--And if there\nexists the knowledge that Brahman is knowledge, then Brahman is an object of\nknowledge, and that, according to your own teaching, implies that Brahman is\nnot of the nature of consciousness.\'\n\nTo explain the second of these _s_ lokas.--If you maintain that what sublates\nNescience is not that knowledge which constitutes Brahman\'s essential nature,\nbut rather that knowledge which has for its object the truth of Brahman being\nof such a nature, we demur; for as both these kinds of knowledge are of the\nsame nature, viz. the nature of light, which is just that which constitutes\nBrahman\'s nature, there is no reason for making a distinction and saying that\none knowledge is contradictory of Nescience, and the other is not. Or, to put\nit otherwise--that essential nature of Brahman which is apprehended through\nthe cognition\n\np. 104\n\nthat Brahman is knowledge, itself shines forth in consequence of the self-\nluminous nature of Brahman, and hence we have no right to make a distinction\nbetween that knowledge which constitutes Brahman\'s nature, and that of which\nthat nature is the object, and to maintain that the latter only is\nantagonistic to Nescience.--Moreover (and this explains the third _s_ loka),\naccording to your own view Brahman, which is mere consciousness, cannot be the\nobject of another consciousness, and hence there is no knowledge which has\nBrahman for its object. If, therefore, knowledge is contradictory to non-\nknowledge (Nescience), Brahman itself must be contradictory to it, and hence\ncannot be its substrate. Shells (mistaken for silver) and the like which by\nthemselves are incapable of throwing light upon their own true nature are not\ncontradictory to non-knowledge of themselves, and depend, for the termination\nof that non-knowledge, on another knowledge (viz. on the knowledge of an\nintelligent being); Brahman, on the other hand, whose essential nature is\nestablished by its own consciousness, is contradictorily opposed to non-\nknowledge of itself, and hence does not depend, for the termination of that\nnon-knowledge, on some other knowledge.--If our opponent should argue that the\nknowledge of the falsity of whatever is other than Brahman is contradictory to\nnon-knowledge, we ask whether this knowledge of the falsity of what is other\nthan Brahman is contradictory to the non-knowledge of the true nature of\nBrahman, or to that non-knowledge which consists in the view of the reality of\nthe apparent world. The former alternative is inadmissible; because the\ncognition of the falsity of what is other than Brahman has a different object\n(from the non-knowledge of Brahman\'s true nature) and therefore cannot be\ncontradictory to it; for knowledge and non-knowledge are contradictory in so\nfar only as they refer to one and the same object. And with regard to the\nlatter alternative we point out that the knowledge of the falsity of the world\nis contradictory to the non-knowledge which consists in the view of the\nreality of the world; the former knowledge therefore sublates the latter non-\nknowledge only, while\n\np. 105\n\nthe non-knowledge of the true nature of Brahman is not touched by it.--Against\nthis it will perhaps be urged that what is here called the non-knowledge of\nthe true nature of Brahman, really is the view of Brahman being dual in\nnature, and that this view is put an end to by the cognition of the falsity of\nwhatever is other than Brahman; while the true nature of Brahman itself is\nestablished by its own consciousness.--But this too we refuse to admit. If\nnon-duality constitutes the true nature of Brahman, and is proved by Brahman\'s\nown consciousness, there is room neither for what is contradictory to it, viz.\nthat non-knowledge which consists in the view of duality, nor for the\nsublation of that non-knowledge.--Let then non-duality be taken for an\nattribute (not the essential nature) of Brahman!--This too we refuse to admit;\nfor you yourself have proved that Brahman, which is pure Consciousness, is\nfree from attributes which are objects of Consciousness.--From all this it\nfollows that Brahman, whose essential nature is knowledge, cannot be the\nsubstrate of Nescience: the theory, in fact, involves a flat contradiction.\n\nWhen, in the next place, you maintain that Brahman, whose nature is\nhomogeneous intelligence, is invested and hidden by Nescience, you thereby\nassert the destruction of Brahman\'s essential nature. Causing light to\ndisappear means either obstructing the origination of light, or else\ndestroying light that exists. And as you teach that light (consciousness)\ncannot originate, the \'hiding\' or \'making to disappear\' of light can only mean\nits destruction.--Consider the following point also. Your theory is that self-\nluminous consciousness, which is without object and without substrate,\nbecomes, through the influence of an imperfection residing within itself,\nconscious of itself as connected with innumerous substrata and innumerous\nobjects.--Is then, we ask, that imperfection residing within consciousness\nsomething real or something unreal?--The former alternative is excluded, as\nnot being admitted by yourself. Nor can we accept the latter alternative; for\nif we did we should have to view that imperfection as being either a knowing\nsubject, or an object of knowledge,\n\np. 106\n\nor Knowing itself. Now it cannot be \'Knowing,\' as you deny that there is any\ndistinction in the nature of knowing; and that \'Knowing,\' which is the\nsubstrate of the imperfection, cannot be held to be unreal, because that would\ninvolve the acceptance of the Madhyamika doctrine, viz. of a general void 1.\n\nAnd if knowers, objects of knowledge and knowing as determined by those two\nare fictitious, i.e. unreal, we have to assume another fundamental\nimperfection, and are thus driven into a _regressuss in infinitum_.--To avoid\nthis difficulty, it might now be said that real consciousness itself, which\nconstitutes Brahman\'s nature, is that imperfection.--But if Brahman itself\nconstitutes the imperfection, then Brahman is the basis of the appearance of a\nworld, and it is gratuitous to assume an additional avidya to account for the\nvorld. Moreover, as Brahman is eternal, it would follow from this hypothesis\nthat no release could ever take place. Unless, therefore, you admit a real\nimperfection apart from Brahman, you are unable to account for the great\nworld-error.\n\nWhat, to come to the next point, do you understand by the inexplicability\n(anirva _k_ aniyata) of Nescience? Its difference in nature from that which\n_is_ , as well as that which _is not_! A thing of such kind would be\ninexplicable indeed; for none of the means of knowledge apply to it. That is\nto say--the whole world of objects must be ordered according to our states of\nconsciousness, and every state of consciousness presents itself in the form,\neither of something existing or of something non-existing. If, therefore, we\nshould assume that of states of consciousness which are limited to this double\nform, the object can be something which is neither existing nor non-existing,\nthen anything\n\np. 107\n\nwhatever might be the object of any state of consciousness whatever.\n\nAgainst this our opponent may now argue as follows:--There is, after all,\nsomething, called avidya, or a _g \xc3\xb1_ana, or by some other name, which is a\npositive entity (bhava), different from the antecedent non-existence of\nknowledge; which effects the obscuration of the Real; which is the material\ncause of the erroneous superimposition on the Real, of manifold external and\ninternal things; and which is terminated by the cognition of the true nature\nof the one substance which constitutes Reality. For this avidya is apprehended\nthrough Perception as well as Inference. Brahman, in so far as limited by this\navidya, is the material cause of the erroneous superimposition--upon the\ninward Self, which in itself is changeless pure intelligence, but has its true\nnature obscured by this superimposition--of that plurality which comprises the\naha _m_ kara, all acts of knowledge and all objects of knowledge. Through\nspecial forms of this defect (i.e. avidya) there are produced, in this world\nsuperimposed upon Reality, the manifold special superimpositions presenting\nthemselves in the form of things and cognitions of things--such as snakes\n(superimposed upon ropes), silver (superimposed on shells), and the like.\nAvidya constitutes the material cause of this entire false world; since for a\nfalse thing we must needs infer a false cause. That this avidya or a _g \xc3\xb1_ana\n(non-knowledge) is an object of internal Perception, follows from the fact\nthat judgments such as \'I do not know\',\'I do not know either myself or\nothers,\' directly present themselves to the mind. A mental state of this kind\nhas for its object not that non-knowledge which is the antecedent non-\nexistence of knowledge--for such absence of knowledge is ascertained by the\nsixth means of proof (anupalabdhi); it rather is a state which presents its\nobject directly, and thus is of the same kind as the state expressed in the\njudgment \'I am experiencing pleasure.\' Even if we admit that \'absence of\nsomething\' (abhava) can be the object of perception, the state of\nconsciousness under discussion cannot have absence of knowledge in the Self\nfor its object. For at the very moment\n\np. 108\n\nof such consciousness knowledge exists; or if it does not exist there can be\nno consciousness of the absence of knowledge. To explain. When I am conscious\nthat I am non-knowing, is there or is there not apprehension of the Self as\nhaving non-existence of knowledge for its attribute, and of knowledge as the\ncounterentity of non-knowledge? In the former case there can be no\nconsciousness of the absence of knowledge, for that would imply a\ncontradiction. In the latter case, such consciousness can all the less exist,\nfor it presupposes knowledge of that to which absence of knowledge belongs as\nan attribute (viz. the Self) and of its own counterentity, viz. knowledge. The\nsame difficulty arises if we view the absence of knowledge as either the\nobject of Inference, or as the object of the special means of proof called\n\'abhava\' (i.e. anupalabdhi). If, on the other hand, non-knowledge is viewed\n(not as a merely negative, but) as a positive entity, there arises no\ncontradiction even if there is (as there is in fact) at the same time\nknowledge of the Self as qualified by non-knowledge, and of knowledge as the\ncounterentity of non-knowledge; and we therefore must accept the conclusion\nthat the state of consciousness expressed by \'I am non-knowing,\' has for its\nobject a non-knowledge which is a positive entity.--But, a Nescience which is\na positive entity, contradicts the witnessing consciousness, whose nature\nconsists in the lighting up of the truth of things! Not so, we reply.\nWitnessing consciousness has for its object not the true nature of things, but\nNescience; for otherwise the lighting up (i.e. the consciousness) of false\nthings could not take place. Knowledge which has for its object non-knowledge\n(Nescience), does not put an end to that non-knowledge. Hence there is no\ncontradiction (between _k_ aitanya and a _g \xc3\xb1_ana).--But, a new objection is\nraised, this positive entity, Nescience, becomes an object of witnessing\nConsciousness, only in so far as it (Nescience) is defined by some particular\nobject (viz. the particular thing which is not known), and such objects depend\nfor their proof on the different means of knowledge. How then can that\nNescience, which is defined by the \'I\' (as expressed e. g. in the judgment, \'I\ndo not\n\np. 109\n\nknow myself\'), become the object of witnessing Consciousness?--There is no\ndifficulty here, we reply. All things whatsoever are objects of Consciousness,\neither as things known or as things not known. But while the mediation of the\nmeans of knowledge is required in the case of all those things which, as being\nnon-intelligent ( _g_ a _d_ a), can be proved only in so far as being objects\nknown (through some means of knowledge), such mediation is not required in the\ncase of the intelligent (a _g_ a _d_ a) inner Self which proves itself.\nConsciousness of Nescience is thus possible in all cases (including the case\n\'I do not know myself\'), since witnessing Consciousness always gives\ndefinition to Nescience.--From all this it follows that, through Perception\nconfirmed by Reasoning, we apprehend Nescience as a positive entity. This\nNescience, viewed as a positive entity, is also proved by Inference, viz. in\nthe following form: All knowledge established by one of the different means of\nproof is preceded by something else, which is different from the mere\nantecedent non-existence of knowledge; which hides the object of knowledge;\nwhich is terminated by knowledge; and which exists in the same place as\nknowledge; because knowledge possesses the property of illumining things not\nillumined before;--just as the light of a lamp lit in the dark illumines\nthings.--Nor must you object to this inference on the ground that darkness is\nnot a substance, but rather the mere absence of light, or else the absence of\nvisual perception of form and colour, and that hence darkness cannot be\nbrought forward as a similar instance proving Nescience to be a positive\nentity. For that Darkness must be considered a positive substance follows,\nfirstly, from its being more or less dense, and secondly, from its being\nperceived as having colour.\n\nTo all this we make the following reply. Neither Perception alone, nor\nPerception aided by Reasoning, reveals to us a positive entity, Nescience, as\nimplied in judgments such as \'I am non-knowing,\' \'I know neither myself nor\nothers.\' The contradiction which was urged above against the view of non-\nknowledge being the antecedent non-existence of knowledge, presents itself\nequally in connexion\n\np. 110\n\nwith non-knowledge viewed as a positive entity. For here the following\nalternative presents itself--the inner Reality is either known or not known as\nthat which gives definition to Nescience by being either its object or its\nsubstrate. If it be thus known, then there is in it no room for Nescience\nwhich is said to be that which is put an end to by the cognition of the true\nnature of the Inner Reality. If, on the other hand, it be not thus known, how\nshould there be a consciousness of Nescience in the absence of that which\ndefines it, viz. knowledge of the substrate or of the object of Nescience?--\nLet it then be said that what is contradictory to non-knowledge is the clear\npresentation of the nature of the inner Self, and that (while there is\nconsciousness of a _g \xc3\xb1_ana) we have only an obscure presentation of the\nnature of the Self; things being thus, there is no contradiction between the\ncognition of the substrate and object of Nescience on the one side, and the\nconsciousness of a _g \xc3\xb1_ana on the other.--Well, we reply, all this holds good\non our side also. Even if a _g \xc3\xb1_ana means antecedent non-existence of\nknowledge, we can say that knowledge of the substrate and object of non-\nknowledge has for its object the Self presented obscurely only; and thus there\nis no difference between our views--unless you choose to be obstinate!\n\nWhether we view non-knowledge as a positive entity or as the antecedent non-\nexistence of knowledge, in either case it comes out as what the word\nindicates, viz. non-knowledge. Non-knowledge means either absence of\nknowledge, or that which is other than knowledge, or that which is\ncontradictory to knowledge; and in any of these cases we have to admit that\nnon-knowledge presupposes the cognition of the nature of knowledge. Even\nthough the cognition of the nature of darkness should not require the\nknowledge of the nature of light, yet when darkness is considered under the\naspect of being contrary to light, this presupposes the cognition of light.\nAnd the non-knowledge held by you is never known in its own nature but merely\nas \'non-knowledge,\' and it therefore presupposes the cognition of knowledge no\nless than our\n\np. 111\n\nview does, according to which non-knowledge is simply the negation of\nknowledge. Now antecedent non-existence of knowledge is admitted by you also,\nand is an undoubted object of consciousness; the right conclusion therefore is\nthat what we are conscious of in such judgments as \'I am non-knowing,\' &c., is\nthis very antecedent non-existence of knowledge which we both admit.\n\nIt, moreover, is impossible to ascribe to Brahman, whose nature is constituted\nby eternal free self-luminous intelligence, the consciousness of Nescience;\nfor what constitutes its essence is consciousness of itself. If against this\nyou urge that Brahman, although having consciousness of Self for its essential\nnature, yet is conscious of non-knowledge in so far as its (Brahman\'s) nature\nis hidden; we ask in return what we have to understand by Brahman\'s nature\nbeing hidden. You will perhaps say \'the fact of its not being illumined.\' But\nhow, we ask, can there be absence of illumination of the nature of that whose\nvery nature consists in consciousness of Self, i.e. self-illumination? If you\nreply that even that whose nature is consciousness of Self may be in the state\nof its nature not being illumined by an outside agency, we point out that as\naccording to you light cannot be considered us an attribute, but constitutes\nthe very nature of Brahman, it would--illumination coming from an external\nagency--follow that the very nature of Brahman can be destroyed from the\noutside. This we have already remarked.--Further, your view implies on the one\nhand that this non-knowledge which is the cause of the concealment of\nBrahman\'s nature hides Brahman in so far as Brahman is conscious of it, and on\nthe other hand that having hidden Brahman, it becomes the object of\nconsciousness on the part of Brahman; and this evidently constitutes a logical\nsee-saw. You will perhaps say 1 that it hides Brahman in so far only as\nBrahman is conscious of it. But, we point out, if the consciousness of a _g\n\xc3\xb1_ana takes place on the part of a Brahman whose nature is not hidden, the\nwhole hypothesis of the \'hiding\' of Brahman\'s nature\n\np. 112\n\nloses its purport, and with it the fundamental hypothesis as to the nature of\na _gn_ ana; for if Brahman may be conscious of a _gn_ ana (without a previous\nobscuration of its nature by a _gn_ ana) it may as well be held to be in the\nsame way conscious of the world, which, by you, is considered to be an effect\nof a _gn_ ana.\n\nHow, further, do you conceive this consciousness of a _gn_ ana on Brahman\'s\npart? Is it due to Brahman itself, or to something else? In the former case\nthis consciousness would result from Brahman\'s essential nature, and hence\nthere would never be any Release. Or else, consciousness of a _gn_ ana\nconstituting the nature of Brahman, which is admittedly pure consciousness, in\nthe same way as the consciousness of false silver is terminated by that\ncognition which sublates the silver, so some terminating act of cognition\nwould eventually put an end to Brahman\'s essential nature itself.--On the\nsecond alternative we ask what that something else should be. If you reply\n\'another a _gn_ ana,\' we are led into a _regressus in infinitum_.--Let it then\nbe said 1that a _gn_ ana having first hidden Brahman then becomes the object\nof its consciousness. This, we rejoin, would imply that a _gn_ ana acting like\na defect of the eye by its very essential being hides Brahman, and then a _gn_\nana could not be sublated by knowledge. Let us then put the case as\nfollows:--A _gn_ ana, which is by itself beginningless, at the very same time\neffects Brahman\'s witnessing it (being conscious of it), and Brahman\'s nature\nbeing hidden; in this way the _regressus in infinitum_ and other difficulties\nwill be avoided.--But this also we cannot admit; for Brahman is essentially\nconsciousness of Self, and cannot become a witnessing principle unless its\nnature be previously hidden.--Let then Brahman be hidden by some other cause!\n--This, we rejoin, would take away from a _gn_ ana its alleged\nbeginninglessness, and further would also lead to an infinite regress. And if\nBrahman were assumed to become a witness, without its essential nature being\nhidden, it could not possess--what yet it is maintained\n\np. 113\n\nto possess--the uniform character of consciousness of Self.--If, moreover,\nBrahman is hidden by avidya, does it then not shine forth at all, or does it\nshine forth to some extent? On the former alternative the not shining forth of\nBrahman--whose nature is mere light--reduces it to an absolute non-entity.\nRegarding the latter alternative we ask, \'of Brahman, which is of an\nabsolutely homogeneous nature, which part do you consider to be concealed, and\nwhich to shine forth?\' To that substance which is pure light, free from all\ndivision and distinction, there cannot belong two modes of being, and hence\nobscuration and light cannot abide in it together.--Let us then say that\nBrahman, which is homogeneous being, intelligence, bliss, has its nature\nobscured by avidya, and hence is seen indistinctly as it were.--But how, we\nask, are we to conceive the distinctness or indistinctness of that whose\nnature is pure light? When an object of light which has parts and\ndistinguishing attributes appears in its totality, we say that it appears\ndistinctly; while we say that its appearance is indistinct when some of its\nattributes do not appear. Now in those aspects of the thing which do not\nappear, light (illumination) is absent altogether, and hence we cannot there\nspeak of indistinctness of light; in those parts on the other hand which do\nappear, the light of which they are the object is distinct. Indistinctness is\nthus not possible at all where there is light. In the case of such things as\nare apprehended as objects, indistinctness may take place, viz. in so far as\nsome of their distinguishing attributes are not apprehended. But in Brahman,\nwhich is not an object, without any distinguishing attributes, pure light, the\nessential nature of which it is to shine forth, indistinctness which consists\nin the non-apprehension of certain attributes can in no way be conceived, and\nhence not be explained as the effect of avidya.\n\nWe, moreover, must ask the following question: \'Is this indistinctness which\nyou consider an effect of avidya put an end to by the rise of true knowledge\nor not?\' On the latter alternative there would be no final release. In the\nformer case we have to ask of what nature Reality is. \'It is of\n\np. 114\n\nan essentially clear and distinct nature.\' Does this nature then exist\npreviously (to the cessation of indistinctness), or not? If it does, there is\nno room whatever either for indistinctness the effect of avidya, or for its\ncessation. If it does not previously exist, then Release discloses itself as\nsomething to be effected, and therefore non-eternal.--And that such non-\nknowledge is impossible because there is no definable substrate for it we have\nshown above.--He, moreover, who holds the theory of error resting on a non-\nreal defect, will find it difficult to prove the impossibility of error being\nwithout any substrate; for, if the cause of error may be unreal, error may be\nsupposed to take place even in case of its substrate being unreal. And the\nconsequence of this would be the theory of a general Void.\n\nThe assertion, again, that non-knowledge as a positive entity is proved by\nInference, also is groundless. But the inference was actually set forth!--\nTrue; but it was set forth badly. For the reason you employed for proving a _g\n\xc3\xb1_ana. is a so-called contradictory one (i.e. it proves the contrary of what\nit is meant to prove), in so far as it proves what is not desired and what is\ndifferent from a _g \xc3\xb1_ana (for what it proves is that there is a certain\n_knowledge_ , viz. that all knowledge resting on valid means of proof has non-\nknowledge for its antecedent). (And with regard to this knowledge again we\nmust ask whether it also has non-knowledge for its antecedent.) If the reason\n(relied on in all this argumentation) does not prove, in this case also, the\nantecedent existence of positive non-knowledge, it is too general (and hence\nnot to be trusted in any case). If, on the other hand, it does prove\nantecedent non-knowledge, then this latter non-knowledge stands in the way of\nthe non-knowledge (which you try to prove by inference) being an object of\nconsciousness, and thus the whole supposition of a _g \xc3\xb1_ana as an entity\nbecomes useless.\n\nThe proving instance, moreover, adduced by our opponent, has no proving power;\nfor the light of a lamp does not possess the property of illumining things not\nillumined\n\np. 115\n\nbefore. Everywhere illumining power belongs to knowledge only; there may be\nlight, but if there is not also Knowledge there is no lighting up of objects.\nThe senses also are only causes of the origination of knowledge, and possess\nno illumining power. The function of the light of the lamp on the other hand\nis a merely auxiliary one, in so far as it dispels the darkness antagonistic\nto the organ of sight which gives rise to knowledge; and it is only with a\nview to this auxiliary action that illumining power is conventionally ascribed\nto the lamp.--But in using the light of the lamp as a proving instance, we did\nnot mean to maintain that it possesses illumining power equal to that of\nlight; we introduced it merely with reference to the illumining power of\nknowledge, in so far as preceded by the removal of what obscures its object!--\nWe refuse to accept this explanation. Illumining power does not only mean the\ndispelling of what is antagonistic to it, but also the defining of things,\ni.e. the rendering them capable of being objects of empirical thought and\nspeech; and this belongs to knowledge only (not to the light of the lamp). If\nyou allow the power of illumining what was not illumined, to auxiliary factors\nalso, you must first of all allow it to the senses which are the most eminent\nfactors of that kind; and as in their case there exists no different thing to\nbe terminated by their activity, (i.e. nothing analogous to the a _g \xc3\xb1_ana to\nbe terminated by knowledge), this whole argumentation is beside the point.\n\nThere are also formal inferences, opposed to the conclusion of the\npurvapakshin.--Of the a _g \xc3\xb1_ana under discussion, Brahman, which is mere\nknowledge, is not the substrate, just because it is a _g \xc3\xb1_ana; as shown by\nthe case of the non-knowledge of the shell (mistaken for silver) and similar\ncases; for such non-knowledge abides within the knowing subject.--The a _g\n\xc3\xb1_ana under discussion does not obscure knowledge, just because it is a _g\n\xc3\xb1_ana; as shown by the cases of the shell, &c.; for such non-knowledge hides\nthe object.--A _g \xc3\xb1_ana is not terminated by knowledge, because it does not\nhide the object of knowledge; whatever non-knowledge is terminated by\nknowledge, is such as to hide\n\np. 116\n\nthe object of knowledge; as e.g. the non-knowledge of the shell.--Brahman is\nnot the substrate of a _g \xc3\xb1_ana, because it is devoid of the character of\nknowing subject; like jars and similar things.--Brahman is not hidden by a _g\n\xc3\xb1_ana, because it is not the object of knowledge; whatever is hidden by non-\nknowledge is the object of knowledge; so e.g. shells and similar things.--\nBrahman is not connected with non-knowledge to be terminated by knowledge,\nbecause it is not the object of knowledge; whatever is connected with non-\nknowledge to be terminated by knowledge is an object of knowledge; as e.g.\nshells and the like. Knowledge based on valid means of proof, has not for its\nantecedent, non-knowledge other than the antecedent non-existence of\nknowledge; just because it is knowledge based on valid proof; like that valid\nknowledge which proves the a _g \xc3\xb1_ana maintained by you.--Knowledge does not\ndestroy a real thing, because it is knowledge in the absence of some specific\npower strengthening it; whatever is capable of destroying things is--whether\nit be knowledge or a _g \xc3\xb1_ana--strengthened by some specific power; as e.g.\nthe knowledge of the Lord and of Yogins; and as the a _g \xc3\xb1_ana consisting in a\npestle (the blow of which destroys the pot).\n\nA _g \xc3\xb1_ana which has the character of a positive entity cannot be destroyed by\nknowledge; just because it is a positive entity, like jars and similar things.\n\nBut, it now may be said, we observe that fear and other affections, which are\npositive entities and produced by previous cognitions, are destroyed by\nsublative acts of cognition!--Not so, we reply. Those affections are not\ndestroyed by knowledge; they rather pass away by themselves, being of a\nmomentary (temporary) nature only, and on the cessation of their cause they do\nnot arise again. That they are of a momentary nature only, follows from their\nbeing observed only in immediate connexion with the causes of their\norigination, and not otherwise. If they were not of a temporary nature, each\nelement of the stream of cognitions, which are the cause of fear and the like,\nwould give rise to a separate feeling of fear, and the result would be that\nthere would be consciousness of many distinct\n\np. 117\n\nfeelings of fear (and this we know not to be the case).--In conclusion we\nremark that in defining right knowledge as \'that which has for its antecedent\nanother entity, different from its own antecedent non-existence,\' you do not\ngive proof of very eminent logical acuteness; for what sense has it to\npredicate of an entity that it is different from nonentity?--For all these\nreasons Inference also does not prove an a _g \xc3\xb1_ana which is a positive\nentity. And that it is not proved by Scripture and arthapatti, will be shown\nlater on. And the reasoning under Su. II, 1, 4. will dispose of the argument\nwhich maintains that of a false thing the substantial cause also must be\nfalse.\n\nWe thus see that there is no cognition of any kind which has for its object a\nNescience of \'inexplicable\' nature.--Nor can such an inexplicable entity be\nadmitted on the ground of apprehension, erroneous apprehension and sublation\n(cp. above, [p. 102](sbe48027.htm#page_102)). For that only which is actually\napprehended, can be the object of apprehension, error and sublation, and we\nhave no right to assume, as an object of these states of consciousness,\nsomething which is apprehended neither by them nor any other state of\nconsciousness.--\'But in the case of the shell, &c., silver is actually\napprehended, and at the same time there arises the sublating consciousness\n"this silver is not real," and it is not possible that one thing should appear\nas another; we therefore are driven to the hypothesis that owing to some\ndefect, we actually apprehend silver of an altogether peculiar kind, viz. such\nas can be defined neither as real nor as unreal.\'--This also we cannot allow,\nsince this very assumption necessarily implies that one thing appears as\nanother. For apprehension, activity, sublation, and erroneous cognition, all\nresult only from one thing appearing as another, and it is not reasonable to\nassume something altogether non-perceived and groundless. The silver, when\napprehended, is not apprehended as something \'inexplicable,\' but as something\nreal; were it apprehended under the former aspect it could be the object\nneither of erroneous nor of sublative cognition, nor would the apprehending\nperson endeavour to seize it. For these reasons you (the anirva- _k_ aniyatva-\nvadin)\n\np. 118\n\nalso must admit that the actual process is that of one thing appearing as\nanother.\n\nThose also who hold other theories as to the kind of cognition under\ndiscussion (of which the shell, mistaken for silver, is an instance) must--\nwhatsoever effort they may make to avoid it--admit that their theory finally\nimplies the appearing of one thing as another. The so-called asatkhyati-view\nimplies that the non-existing appears as existing; the atmakhyati-view, that\nthe Self--which here means \'cognition\'--appears as a thing; and the akhyati-\nview, that the attribute of one thing appears as that of another, that two\nacts of cognition appear as one, and--on the view of the non-existence of the\nobject--that the non-existing appears as existing 1.\n\nMoreover, if you say that there is originated silver of a totally new\ninexplicable kind, you are bound to assign the cause of this origination. This\ncause cannot be the perception of the silver; for the perception has the\nsilver for its object, and hence has no existence before the origination of\nthe silver. And should you say that the perception, having arisen without an\nobject, produces the silver and thereupon makes it its object, we truly do not\nknow what to say to such excellent reasoning!--Let it then be said that the\ncause is some defect in the sense-organ.--This, too, is inadmissible; for a\ndefect abiding in the percipient person cannot produce an objective effect.--\nNor can the organs of sense (apart from defects) give rise to the silver; for\nthey are causes of cognitions only (not of things cognised). Nor, again, the\nsense-organs in so far as modified by some defect; for they also can only\nproduce modifications in what is effected by them, i.e. cognition. And the\nhypothesis of a beginningless, false a _g \xc3\xb1_ana constituting the general\nmaterial cause of all erroneous cognitions has been refuted above.\n\nHow is it, moreover, that this new and inexplicable thing\n\np. 119\n\n[paragraph continues] (which you assume to account for the silver perceived on\nthe shell) becomes to us the object of the idea and word \'silver,\' and not of\nsome other idea and term, e.g. of a jar?--If you reply that this is due to its\nsimilarity to silver, we point out that in that case the idea and the word\npresenting themselves to our mind should be that of \'something resembling\nsilver.\' Should you, on the other hand, say that we apprehend the thing as\nsilver because it possesses the generic characteristics of silver, we ask\nwhether these generic characteristics are real or unreal. The former\nalternative is impossible, because something real cannot belong to what is\nunreal; and the latter is impossible because something unreal cannot belong to\nwhat is real.\n\nBut we need not extend any further this refutation of an altogether ill-\nfounded theory.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[102:1](sbe48028.htm#fr_17) \'Nescience\' is sublated (refuted) by the cognition\nof Brahman, p. 103 and thereby shown to have been the object of erroneous\ncognition: it thus cannot be \'being,\' i.e. real. Nor can it be altogether\nunreal, \'non-being,\' because in that case it could not be the object either of\nmental apprehension or of sublation.\n\n[106:1](sbe48028.htm#fr_18) If the imperfection inhering in Consciousness is\nitself of the nature of consciousness, and at the same time unreal, we should\nhave to distinguish two kinds of Consciousness--which is contrary to the\nfundamental doctrine of the oneness of Consciousness. And if, on the other\nhand, we should say that the Consciousness in which the imperfection inheres\nis of the same nature as the latter, i.e. unreal, we are landed in the view of\nuniversal unreality.\n\n[111:1](sbe48028.htm#fr_19) Allowing the former view of the question only.\n\n[112:1](sbe48028.htm#fr_20) Adopting the latter view only; see preceding note.\n\n[118:1](sbe48028.htm#fr_21) For a full explanation of the nature of these\n\'khyatis,\' see A.
