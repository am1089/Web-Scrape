Not on account of (difference of) place also twofold characteristics can\nbelong to the highest; for everywhere (scripture teaches it to be without any\ndifference).\n\nWe now attempt to ascertain, on the ground of _S_ ruti, the nature of that\nBrahman with which the individual soul becomes united in the state of deep\nsleep and so on, in consequence of the cessation of the limiting adjuncts.--\nThe scriptural passages which refer to Brahman are of a double character; some\nindicate that Brahman is affected by difference, so, e.g. 'He to whom belong\nall works, all desires, all sweet odours and tastes' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 14,2);\nothers, that it is without difference, so, e.g. 'It is neither coarse nor\nfine, neither short nor long,' &c. (B _ri_. Up. III, 8, 8). Have we, on the\nground of these passages, to assume that Brahman\n\np. 153\n\nhas a double nature, or either nature, and, if either, that it is affected\nwith difference, or without difference? This is the point to be discussed.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that, in conformity with the scriptural passages\nwhich indicate a double nature, a double nature is to be ascribed to Brahman.\n\nTo this we reply as follows.--At any rate the highest Brahman cannot, by\nitself, possess double characteristics; for on account of the contradiction\nimplied therein, it is impossible to admit that one and the same thing should\nby itself possess certain qualities, such as colour, &c.. and should not\npossess them.--Nor is it possible that Brahman should possess double\ncharacteristics 'on account of place,' i.e. on account of its conjunction with\nits limiting adjuncts, such as earth, &c. For the connexion with limiting\nadjuncts is unavailing to impart to a thing of a certain nature an altogether\ndifferent nature. The crystal, e.g. which is in itself clear, does not become\ndim through its conjunction with a limiting adjunct in the form of red colour;\nfor that it is pervaded by the quality of dimness is an altogether erroneous\nnotion. In the case of Brahman the limiting adjuncts are, moreover, presented\nby Nescience merely [1](sbe38115.htm#fn_112). Hence (as the upadhis are the\nproduct of Nescience) if we embrace either of the two alternatives, we must\ndecide in favour of that according to which Brahma is absolutely devoid of all\ndifference, not in favour of the opposite one. For all passages whose aim it\nis to represent the nature of Brahman (such as, 'It is without sound, without\ntouch, without form, without decay,' Ka. Up. I, 3, 15) teach that it is free\nfrom all difference.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2, 12](sbe38115.htm)\n\n"
