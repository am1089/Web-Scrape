Nor (can it be said that the pradhana modifies itself spontaneously) like\ngrass, &c. (which turn into milk); for (milk) does not exist elsewhere (but in\nthe female animal).\n\nLet this be (the Sa _n_ khya resumes). Just as grass, herbs, water, &c.\nindependently of any other instrumental cause transform themselves, by their\nown nature, into milk; so, we assume, the pradhana also transforms itself into\nthe great principle, and so on. And, if you ask how we know that grass\ntransforms itself independently of any instrumental cause; we reply, 'Because\nno such cause is observed.' For if we did perceive some such cause, we\ncertainly should apply it to grass, &c. according to our liking, and thereby\nproduce milk. But as a matter of fact we do no such thing. Hence the\ntransformation of grass and the like must be considered to be due to its own\nnature merely; and we may infer therefrom that the transformation of the\npradhana is of the same kind.\n\nTo this we make the following reply.--The transformation of the pradhana might\nbe ascribed to its own nature merely if we really could admit that grass\nmodifies itself in the manner stated by you; but we are unable to admit that,\nsince another instrumental cause is observed. How? 'Because it does not exist\nelsewhere.' For grass becomes milk only when it is eaten by a cow or some\nother female animal, not if it is left either uneaten or is eaten by a bull.\nIf the transformation had no special cause, grass would become milk even on\nother conditions than that of entering a cow's body. Nor would the\ncircumstance of men not being able to produce milk according to their liking\nprove that there is no instrumental cause; for while some effects can be\nproduced by men, others result from divine action only  1. The fact, however,\nis that men also are able, by\n\np. 372\n\napplying a means in their power, to produce milk from grass and herbs; for\nwhen they wish to procure a more abundant supply of milk they feed the cow\nmore plentifully and thus obtain more milk from her.--For these reasons the\nspontaneous modification of the pradhana cannot be proved from the instance of\ngrass and the like.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[371:1](sbe34181.htm#fr_330) It might be held that for the transformation of\ngrass into milk no other cause is required than the digestive heat of the\ncow's p. 372 body; but a reflecting person will acknowledge that there also\nthe omniscient Lord is active.
