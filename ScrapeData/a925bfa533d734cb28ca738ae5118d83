Svaha!"\'\xc2\x97while the husband murmurs (this)\ntext, she sacrifices standing.\n\n2 2. (All the ceremonies,) beginning from the treading\n\np. 38\n\nupon the stone, (are repeated) in the same way for a second time,\n\n3\\. And in the same way a third time.\n\n4\\. Silently, if they like, a fourth time.\n\n5 5. (The \xc3\x82 _k_ arya?) makes (them) step forward in a north-eastern direction\nseven steps (with the words),\n\n6\\. \'For sap with one step, for juice with two steps, for the prospering of\nwealth with three steps, for comfort with four steps, for cattle with five\nsteps, for the seasons with six steps. Friend be with seven steps.\'\n\n7\\. (The \xc3\x82 _k_ arya?) \'appeases\' those (foot-steps) with water.\n\n8 8. With the three \xc3\x82pohish _th_ iya verses (Rig-veda X, 9, 1-3) he wipes\n(them) with the Stheya water,\n\n9 9. And sprinkles it on their heads.\n\n10\\. (The bridegroom then) says, \'I give you a cow.\'\n\n11\\. Let him give something to the Brahma _n_ as each time at the Sthalipakas\nand other rites;\n\n12 12.

The treading on the stone is prescribed in\nchap. 13, 12.\n\n[38:5](sbe29016.htm#fr_83) 5, 7. According to Naraya _n_ a it is the teacher\nwho makes them walk the seven steps; the Paddhati says that the bridegroom or\nthe \xc3\x82 _k_ arya causes her to do so. Comp. Paraskara I, 8, 1; \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana I,\n7, 19, &c.\n\n[38:8](sbe29016.htm#fr_84) Comp. chap. 13, 9.\n\n[38:9](sbe29016.htm#fr_85) Probably we should read murdhani (acc. dual.), not\nmurdhani. \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana has _s_ irasi. Of course the heads of both the\nbridegroom and the bride were sprinkled with water; comp. \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana I, 7,\n20, &c.\n\n[38:12](sbe29016.htm#fr_86) The Surya hymn is Rig-veda X, 85. Comp. the note\nabove on chap. 13, 4.\n\n[39:13-15](sbe29016.htm#fr_87) These Sutras, treating of the fee for the\nsacrifice, are identical with Paraskara I, 8, 15-18. Apparently they are taken\nfrom the same lost original from which several identical passages in the\nSutras of Paraskara and _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana seem to be derived (see the notes on\nchap. 5, 1; 13, 7). They stand rather out of place here, for they return to\nthe same subject which had already been treated of in Sutra 10, though in that\nSutra, as very frequently is the case in our text and in similar ones, only\nthe case of the bridegroom being a Brahma _n_ a has been taken notice of.\n\n[39:16](sbe29016.htm#fr_88) Comp. the passages quoted by Professor Stenzler on\nParaskara I, 8, 18. Naraya _n_ a has the following note: \'To a duhit _ri_ mat,\ni.e. to the father of a girl who has no brother, he shall give a hundred cows\nand besides a chariot, in order to destroy the guilt brought about by marrying\na girl who has no brother.\' Possibly we should here emancipate ourselves from\nthe authority of the commentators, and explain duhit _ri_ mat \'he who gives\nhis daughter in marriage,\' the bride\'s father. Comp. \xc3\x82pastamba II, 11, 18; II,\n13, 12; Weber, Indische Studien, V, 343, note 2.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 15](sbe29017.htm)\n\n'
