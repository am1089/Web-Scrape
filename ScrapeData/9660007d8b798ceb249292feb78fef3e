XV.\n\nExplanation of the reason why \xc5\x9ai\xc5\x9bupala in his previous births as\nHiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu and Ravan\xcc\x81a was not identified with Vishn\xcc\x81u on being slain by\nhim, and was so identified when killed as \xc5\x9ai\xc5\x9bupala. The wives of Vasudeva: his\nchildren: Balarama and Krishn\xcc\x81a his sons by Devaki: born apparently of Rohin\xcc\x81i\nand Yasoda. The wives and children of Krishn\xcc\x81a. Multitude of the descendants\nof Yadu.\n\nMAITREYA.--Most eminent of all who cultivate piety, I am curious to hear from\nyou, and you are able to explain to me, how it happened that the same being\nwho when killed by Vishn\xcc\x81u as Hiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu and Ravan\xcc\x81a obtained enjoyments\nwhich, though scarcely attainable by the immortals, were but temporary, should\nhave been absorbed into the eternal Hari when slain by him in the person of\n\xc5\x9ai\xc5\x9bupala.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--When the divine author of the creation, preservation, and\ndestruction of the universe accomplished the death of Hiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu, he\nassumed a body composed of the figures of a lion and a man, so that\nHiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu was not aware that his destroyer was Vishn\xcc\x81u: although\ntherefore the quality of purity, derived from exceeding merit, had been\nattained, yet his mind was perplexed by the predominance of the property of\npassion; and the consequence of that intermixture was, that he reaped, as the\nresult of his death by the hands of Vishn\xcc\x81u, only unlimited power and\nenjoyment upon earth, as Da\xc5\x9banana, the sovereign of the three spheres; he did\nnot obtain absorption into the supreme spirit, that is without beginning or\nend, because his mind was not wholly dedicated to that sole object. So also\nDa\xc5\x9banana being entirely subject to the passion of love, and engrossed\ncompletely by the thoughts of Janaki, could not comprehend that the son of\nDa\xc5\x9baratha whom he beheld was in reality the divine Achyuta. At the moment of\nhis death he was impressed with the notion that his adversary was a mortal,\nand therefore the fruit he derived from being slain by Vishn\xcc\x81u was confined to\nhis birth in the illustrious family of the kings of Chedi, and the exercise of\nextensive dominion. In this situation many circumstances brought the names of\nVishn\xcc\x81u to his notice, and on all these occasions the enmity that had\naccumulated through successive births influenced his\n\np. 439\n\nmind; and in speaking constantly with disrespect of Achyuta, he was ever\nrepeating his different appellations. Whether walking, eating, sitting, or\nsleeping, his animosity was never at rest, and Krishn\xcc\x81a was ever present to\nhis thoughts in his ordinary semblance, having eyes as beautiful as the leaf\nof the lotus, clad in bright yellow raiment, decorated with a garland, with\nbracelets on his arms and wrists, and a diadem on his head; having four robust\narms, bearing the conch, the discus, the mace, and the lotus. Thus uttering\nhis names, even though in malediction, and dwelling upon his image, though in\nenmity, he beheld Krishn\xcc\x81a, when inflicting his death, radiant with\nresplendent weapons, bright with ineffable splendour in his own essence as the\nsupreme being, and all his passion and hatred ceased, and he was purified\nfront every defect. Being killed by the discus of Vishn\xcc\x81u at the instant he\nthus meditated, all his sins were consumed by his divine adversary, and he was\nblended with him by whose might he had been slain. I have thus replied to your\ninquiries. He by whom the divine Vishn\xcc\x81u is named or called to recollection,\neven in enmity, obtains a reward that is difficult of attainment to the demons\nand the gods: how much greater shall be his recompense who glorifies the deity\nin fervour and in faith!\n\nVasudeva, also called \xc3\x81nakadandubhi, had Rohin\xcc\x81i, Pauravi 1, Bhadra, Madira,\nDevaki, and several other wives. His sons by Rohin\xcc\x81i were Balabhadra, Saran\xcc\x81a,\n\xc5\x9aaru, Durmada, and others. Balabhadra espoused Revati, and had by her Nisat\xcc\x81ha\nand Ulmuka. The sons of \xc5\x9aaran\xcc\x81a were Marsht\xcc\x81i, Marsht\xcc\x81imat, \xc5\x9ai\xc5\x9bu, Satyadhriti,\nand others. Bhadra\xc5\x9bwa, Bhadrabahu, Durgama, Bhuta, and others, were born in\nthe family of Rohin\xcc\x81i (of the race of Puru). The sons of Vasudeva by Madira\nwere Nanda, Upananda, Kritaka, and others. Bhadra bore him Upanidhi, Gada, and\nothers. By his wife Vai\xc5\x9bali he had one son named Kau\xc5\x9bika. Devaki bore him six\nsons, Kirttimat, Sushen\xcc\x81a, Udayin, Bhadrasena, Rijuda\xc5\x9ba, and Bhadradeha; all\nof whom Kansa put to death 2.\n\np. 440\n\nWhen Devaki was pregnant the seventh time, Yoganidra (the sleep of devotion),\nsent by Vishn\xcc\x81u, extricated the embryo from its maternal womb at midnight, and\ntransferred it to that of Rohin\xcc\x81i; and from having been thus taken away, the\nchild (who was Balarama) received the name of Sankarshan\xcc\x81a. Next, the divine\nVishn\xcc\x81u himself, the root of the vast universal tree, inscrutable by the\nunderstandings of all gods, demons, sages, and men, past, present, or to come,\nadored by Brahma and all the deities, he who is without beginning, middle, or\nend, being moved to relieve the earth of her load, descended into the womb of\nDevaki, and was born as her son Vasudeva. Yoganidra, proud to execute his\norders, removed the embryo to Yasoda, the wife of Nanda the cowherd. At his\nbirth the earth was relieved from all iniquity; the sun, moon, and planets\nshone with unclouded splendour; all fear of calamitous portents was dispelled;\nand universal happiness prevailed. From the moment he appeared, all mankind\nwere led into the righteous path in him.\n\nWhilst this powerful being resided in this world of mortals, he had sixteen\nthousand and one hundred wives; of these the principal were Rukmini,\nSatyabhama, Jambavati, Jataha\xc5\x9bini, and four others. By these the universal\nform, who is without beginning, begot a hundred and eighty thousand sons, of\nwhom thirteen are most renowned, Pradyumna, Charudeshn\xcc\x81a, Samba, and others.\nPradyumna married Kakudwati, the daughter of Rukmin, and had by her Aniruddha.\nAniruddha married Subhadra, the granddaughter of the same Rukmin, and she bore\nhim a son named Vajra. The son of Vajra was Bahu; and his son was Sucharu 3.\n\np. 441\n\nIn this manner the descendants of Yadu multiplied, and there were many\nhundreds of thousands of them, so that it would be impossible to repeat their\nnames in hundreds of years. Two verses relating to them are current: "The\ndomestic instructors of the boys in the use of arms amounted to three crores\nand eighty lacs (or thirty-eight millions). Who shall enumerate the whole of\nthe mighty men of the Yadava race, who were tens of ten thousands and hundreds\nof hundred thousands in number?" Those powerful Daityas who were killed in the\nconflicts between them and the gods were born again upon earth as men, as\ntyrants and oppressors; and, in order to check their violence, the gods also\ndescended to the world of mortals, and became members of the hundred and one\nbranches of the family of Yadu. Vishn\xcc\x81u was to them a teacher and a ruler, and\nall the Yadavas were obedient to his commands.\n\nWhoever listens frequently to this account of the origin of the heroes of the\nrace of Vrishn\xcc\x81i, shall be purified from all sin, and obtain the sphere of\nVishn\xcc\x81u.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[439:1](vp108.htm#fr_1181) Pauravi is rather a title attached to a second\nRohin\xcc\x81i, to distinguish her from the first, the mother of Balarama: she is\nalso said by the Vayu to be the daughter of Bahlika.\n\n[439:2](vp108.htm#fr_1182) The enumeration of our text is rather imperfect.\nThe Vayu names the wives of Vasudeva, Pauravi, Rohin\xcc\x81i, Madira, Rudra,\nVai\xc5\x9bakhi, Devaki; and adds two bondmaids, Sugandhi and Vanaraji. The p. 440\nBrahma P. and Hari V. name twelve wives, and two slaves; Rohini, Madira,\nVai\xc5\x9bakhi, Bhadra, Sunamni, Sahadeva, \xc5\x9aantideva, \xc5\x9arideva, Devarakshita,\nVrikadevi, Upadevi, Devaki; and \xc5\x9aantanu and Barava. The children of the two\nslaves, according to the Vayu, were Pun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ra, who became a king, and Kapila,\nwho retired to the woods. In the Bhagavata we have thirteen wives, Pauravi,\nRohin\xcc\x81i, Bhadra, Madira, Rochana, Ila, Devaki, Dhritadevi, \xc5\x9aantideva, Upadevi,\n\xc5\x9arideva, Devarakshita, and Sahadeva: the last seven in this and the preceding\nlist are the daughters of Devaka.\n\n[440:3](vp108.htm#fr_1183) The wives and children of Krishn\xcc\x81a are more\nparticularly described in the next book. The Brahma P. and Hari V. add some\ndetails of the descendants of Vasudeva\'s brothers: thus Devabhaga is said to\nbe the father of Uddhava; Anadhrisht\xcc\x81i of Deva\xc5\x9bravas, a great scholar or\nPan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81it. Deva\xc5\x9bravas, another brother of Vasudeva, p. 441 had \xc5\x9aatrughna and\nanother son called Ekalavya, who for some cause being exposed when an infant,\nwas found and brought up by the Nishadas, and was thence termed Nishadin.\nVatsavat (Vatsabalaka) and Gan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81usha being childless, Vasudeva gave his son\nKau\xc5\x9bika to be adopted by the former, and Krishn\xcc\x81a gave Charudeshn\xcc\x81a and three\nothers to the latter. Kanaka (Karundhaka) had two sons, Tantrija and\nTantripala. Avaksrinjima (\xc5\x9arinjaya) had also two, Vira and A\xc5\x9bwahanu. The\ngracious \xc5\x9aamika became as the son (although the brother) of \xc5\x9ayama, and\ndisdaining the joint rule which the princes of the house of Bhoja exercised,\nmade himself paramount. Yudhisht\xcc\x81hira was his friend. The extravagant numbers\nof the Yadavas merely indicate that they were, as they undoubtedly were, a\npowerful and numerous tribe, of whom many traces exist in various parts of\nIndia.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XVI](vp109.htm)\n\n'
