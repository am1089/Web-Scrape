Once on an occasion, the highly energetic Muni Paras'ara went out on\npilgrimage and arrived on the banks of the Yamuna, and spoke to the religious\nfisherman who __ was taking his food then thus :-- \xc2\x93O fisherman! Take me on\nyour boat and carry me to the other side of the river.\xc2\x94 Hearing this, the\nfisherman spoke to the beautiful girl Matsyagandha :-- \xc2\x93O beautiful smiling\none! This religious ascetic intends to cross the river; so take the boat and\ncarry him to the other bank.\xc2\x94 Thus ordered by her father, the exceedingly\nbeautiful Vasu girl Matsyagandha began to steer the boat whereon sat the Muni.\nThus while the boat was sliding on the waters of the Yamuna; the Muni\nParas'ara saw the beautiful-eyed damsel Matsyagandha and became as if under\nthe command of the great destiny, greatly enamoured of her. He desired to\nenjoy Matsyagandha, full of youth and beauty and with his right hand caught\nhold of her left hand; the blue coloured Matsya looking askance spoke out\nsmilingly in the following words :-- O knower of Dharma! What are you going to\ndo, pierced by the arrows of Cupid? What you desire now, is it worthy of your\nfamily or your study of the S\xc2\x92astras or worthy of your Tapasya; see, you are\nborn in the line of Vas'i _st_ ha and you are well known as of good character.\nO best of Brahmi _n_ s! You are quite aware that the attaining of a man-birth\nin this world is very rare; and over and above this the attainment of\nBrahminhood is, as far as my knowledge goes, particularly difficult.\n\n\n\n11-14. O Prince of Brahmi _n_ s! You are the foremost and best as far as your\nfamily, goodness, and learning in the Vedas and other S\xc2\x92astras are concerned;\nyou are well versed in Dharma; how is it, then, that you are going to do this\nact, not worthy of an \xc3\x82rya, though you see me possessed of this bad smell of\nfish throughout my body. O one of unbaffled understanding! O best of twice-\nborn! What auspicious sign do you see in my body that you are stricken with\npassion on my account that you have caught hold of my hand to enjoy me? Why\nhave you gotten your own Dharma? Thus saying, Matsyagandha thought within\nherself :-- \xc2\x93Alas! This Brahmi _n_ has certainly lost his brains in order to\nenjoy me; certainly he will be drowned just now in his attempt to enjoy me in\nthis boat; his mind is so much agitated with the arrows of Cupid that no body,\nit seems, can act against his will.\xc2\x94 Thus thinking Matsyagandha spoke again to\nthe Muni :-- \xc2\x93O highly fortunate one! Hold patience! let me first take you to\nthe other side of the river; then you may do as you please.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n15-19. Hearing these reasonable words, the Muni let loose of her hand and took\nhis seat on the boat and gradually got down on the other bank of the\n\n\n\np. 82\n\n\n\nriver. But the Muni, becoming again extremely passionate caught hold of\nMatsyagandha; when the young woman spoke to Paras\xc2\x92ara, in front of her,\nshuddering :-- \xc2\x93O best of Munis! My body is emitting very bad smell; do you\nnot feel this? You know very well that the sexual intercourse between male and\nfemale of similar types brings in happiness and comfort.\xc2\x94 Thus spoken to,\nParas\xc2\x92ara made Matsyagandha emit sweet scent like that of musk to a distance\nof one Yojana (8 miles) and her body exceedingly lovely and beautiful and,\nbecoming extremely passionate, again caught hold of her right hand.\n\n\n\n20-34. Then the auspicious Satyavati addressed Paras\xc2\x92ara Muni, resolved to\nenjoy her, thus :-- \xc2\x93O Muni! Behold! all are looking at us; my father too, is\nthere on the bank of the Yamuna; so, O Muni! wait till night this beastly act\nbefore all is highly unsatisfactory to me. The wise persons declare it a great\nsin to commit sexual intercourse during day they have ordained night time as\nthe best time of intercourse for men not the day time; the more so that many\nperson's eyes are in this direction. So, O intelligent one! hold on your\npassion for a while; for the blame pronounced by the public is horrible.\xc2\x94\nHearing these reasonable words, the liberal minded Paras'ara created, by his\ninfluence of Tapasya, a dense fog so that both the banks of the Yamuna became\ncovered with darkness. Then Matsyagandha gently spoke to the Muni :-- \xc2\x93O best\nof Dvijas! I am not as yet married; I am now a girl; you will go away after\nenjoying me; your semen virile is not fruitless; so Brahma _n_! What will be\nmy fate? If I be pregnant today, what shall I say to my father? and what will\nbe my future state? There is no doubt that, after enjoying me, you will go\naway; what will I do afterwards; kindly say.\xc2\x94 Hearing these words of\nMatsyagandha, Paras'ara said :-- \xc2\x93O beloved! after you have done my pleasant\nduty, you will remain a girl as you are now; yet, O timid one! ask from me any\nboon you like; I will grant it to you.\xc2\x94 Satyavati then said :-- \xc2\x93O best Brahma\n_n_ , O giver of one's honour! grant me these things :-- That my father and\nmother do not know anything of this affair and that my virginity be again as\never the same. Also let an extraordinarily powerful energetic son be born to\nme like you; let this nice smell continue to remain always in my body and let\nmy youth and beauty remain afresh and increase ever more. Hearing this,\nParas'ara said :-- \xc2\x93O beautiful one! a son, very pure and holy, will be born\nto you, from Narayana's part! his name will be famous in the three worlds. O\nbeautiful one! never before my heart was agitated with such passion. I do not\nknow why I have become so much passionate for you. I saw the unrivalled\nbeauties of Apsaras but I never lost my patience; but seeing you, I have\nbecome attracted to you; it must be under the\n\n\n\np. 83\n\n\n\ndirection of Providence; know it certain that there must be some mysterious\ncause in this. However Fate is unavoidable to all; otherwise you are full of\nso bad smell; why shall I be fascinated by your sight? O beautiful one! your\nson will be famed in the three worlds; will compose the Pura _n_ as and will\nsub-divide the Vedas.\n\n\n\nThus saying, the Muni Paras'ara enjoyed Matsyagandha, who became quite\nsubmissive; and after bathing in the Yamuna, quickly went away. On the other\nhand, the chaste Satyavati, too, became pregnant and immediately gave birth on\nthe island of Yamuna to a son beautiful, as if the Second Kamadeva, the god of\nLove, Kamadeva. No sooner that son, very fiery and highly potent, was born\nthan he devoted his mind to tapasya and spoke to his own mother Satyavati thus\n:--\xc2\x93O Mother! now go wherever you like; I will also go to perform tapasya. O\nhighly fortunate one; No sooner you remember me, I will come to you. O Mother!\nwhere you will have any onerous duty, remember me and I will instantly come to\nyou. Let all good be unto you; now I go. Avoid all cares and live happily.\nThus saying, Vyasadeva went out. Matsyagandha, too, went back to his father.\nVyasa was named also Dvaipayan (born in an island, a Dvipa) in as much as\nSatyavati gave birth to him in a Dvipa island); and as he was born of Vi _sn_\nu's parts, he grew up no sooner he was born.\n\n\n\nThe Muni Dvaipayana bathed in every Tirtha and performed the highest\nasceticism. Thus Dvaipayan Vyasa was born of Paras'ara in Satyavati\xc2\x92s womb.\nSeeing the advent of Kali Yuga, he adorned the tree of the Vedas with many\nS\xc2\x92akhas (branches). It is because he expanded the Vedas many S\xc2\x92akhas, that he\nis denominated also as VedaVyas; he composed eighteen Pura _n_ as, Samhitas,\nthe excellent Mahabharat, subdivided the Vedas and made his disciples Sumantu,\nJaimini, Paila, Vaisampayan, Asita, Devala and his son S\xc2\x92uka to study them.\n\n\n\nSuta said :-- \xc2\x93O Munis! Thus I have described to you the birth of the holy\nVyasa, the son of Satyavati and all the causes. O Munis! Do not allow any\ndoubt enter your mind as regards his birth; for it is always advisable to take\nup only the good things as far as the lives of great persons and Munis are\nconcerned. There must be some extraordinary mysterious cause owing to which\nSatyavati was born of a fish, and she was first united to Paras'ara and then\nto Santanu. Otherwise how can __ one account for the fact of the Muni\nParas\xc2\x92ara being so much agitated by passion and why he would behave like a\nmean low person in the committal of a a grossly blameable act? Now has __ been\nspoken the wonderful birth story of Vyasa Deva together with all incidents,\nand enveloped under the great mystery. If any man hears this holy narrative,\nhe will be freed from sins and will never fall into difficulties and will\nalways be happy.\n\n\n\np. 84\n\n\n\nThus ends the Second Chapter of the Second Skandha on the birth of Vyasa Deva\nin the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam __ of 18,000 verses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 3](bk02ch03.htm)\n\n"
