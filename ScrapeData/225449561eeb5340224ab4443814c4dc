And it is minute.\n\nAnd the chief vital air is to be considered as minute like the other pra _n_\nas.--Here also we have to understand by minuteness that the chief vital air is\nsubtle and of limited size, not that is of atomic size; for by means of its\nfive functions it pervades the entire body. It must be viewed as subtle\nbecause when passing out of the body it is not perceived by a bystander, and\nas limited because scripture speaks of its passing out, going and coming.--\nBut, it may be said, scripture speaks also of its all-pervadingness; so,\n\np. 91\n\ne.g. 'He is equal to a grub, equal to a gnat, equal to an elephant, equal to\nthese three worlds, equal to this Universe' (B _ri_. Up. I, 3, 22).--To this\nwe reply that the all-pervadingness of which this text speaks belongs to the\nSelf of the pra _n_ a in its adhidaivata relation, according to which it\nappears as Hira _n_ yagarbha in his double--universal and individual--form,\nnot in its adhyatma relation. Moreover the statements of equality 'equal to a\ngrub,' &c., just declare the limited size of the pra _n_ a which abides within\nevery living being.--Thus there remains no difficulty.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 4, 14](sbe38068.htm)\n\n"
