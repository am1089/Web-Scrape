A thing is only completely our own when\nit is a thing of joy to us.\n\nThe greater part of this world is to us as if it were nothing. But we cannot\nallow it to remain so, for thus it belittles our own self. The entire world is\ngiven to us, and all our powers have their final meaning in the faith that by\ntheir help we are to take possession of our patrimony.\n\nBut what is the function of our sense of beauty in this process of the\nextension of our consciousness? Is it there to separate truth into strong\nlights and shadows, and bring it before us in its uncompromising distinction\nof beauty and ugliness? If that were so, then we would have had to admit that\nthis sense of beauty creates a dissension in our universe and sets up a wall\nof hindrance across the highway of communication that leads from everything to\nall things.\n\nBut that cannot be true. As long as our realisation is incomplete a division\nnecessarily remains between things known and unknown, pleasant and unpleasant.\nBut in spite of the dictum of some philosophers man does not accept any\narbitrary and absolute limit to his knowable world. Every day his science is\npenetrating into the region formerly marked in his map as unexplored or\ninexplorable. Our sense of beauty is similarly engaged in ever pushing on its\nconquests. Truth is everywhere, therefore everything is the object of our\nknowledge. Beauty is omnipresent, therefore everything is capable of giving us\njoy.\n\nIn the early days of his history man took everything as a phenomenon of life.\nHis science of life began by creating a sharp distinction between life and\nnon-life. But as it is proceeding farther and farther the line of demarcation\nbetween the animate and inanimate is growing more and more dim. In the\nbeginning of our apprehension these sharp lines of contrast are helpful to us,\nbut as our comprehension becomes clearer they gradually fade away.\n\nThe Upanishads have said that all things are created and sustained by an\ninfinite joy. To realise this principle of creation we have to start with a\ndivision--the division into the beautiful and the non-beautiful. Then the\napprehension of beauty has to come to us with a vigorous blow to awaken our\nconsciousness from its primitive lethargy, and it attains its object by the\nurgency of the contrast. Therefore our first acquaintance with beauty is in\nher dress of motley colours, that affects us with its stripes and feathers,\nnay, with its disfigurements. But as our acquaintance ripens, the apparent\ndiscords are resolved into modulations of rhythm. At first we detach beauty\nfrom its surroundings, we hold it apart from the rest, but at the end we\nrealise its harmony with all. Then the music of beauty has no more need of\nexciting us with loud noise; it renounces violence, and appeals to our heart\nwith the truth that it is meekness inherits the earth.\n\nIn some stage of our growth, in some period of our history, we try to set up a\nspecial cult of beauty, and pare it down to a narrow circuit, so as to make it\na matter of pride for a chosen few. Then it breeds in its votaries affections\nand exaggerations, as it did with the Brahmins in the time of the decadence of\nIndian civilisation, when the perception of the higher truth fell away and\nsuperstitions grew up unchecked.\n\nIn the history of aesthetics there also comes an age of emancipation when the\nrecognition of beauty in things great and small become easy, and when we see\nit more in the unassuming harmony of common objects than in things startling\nin their singularity. So much so, that we have to go through the stages of\nreaction when in the representation of beauty we try to avoid everything that\nis obviously pleasing and that has been crowned by the sanction of convention.\nWe are then tempted in defiance to exaggerate the commonness of commonplace\nthings, thereby making them aggressively uncommon. To restore harmony we\ncreate the discords which are a feature of all reactions. We already see in\nthe present age the sign of this aesthetic reaction, which proves that man has\nat last come to know that it is only the narrowness of perception which\nsharply divides the field of his aesthetic consciousness into ugliness and\nbeauty. When he has the power to see things detached from self-interest and\nfrom the insistent claims of the lust of the senses, then alone can he have\nthe true vision of the beauty that is everywhere. Then only can he see that\nwhat is unpleasant to us is not necessarily unbeautiful, but has its beauty in\ntruth.\n\nWhen we say that beauty is everywhere we do not mean that the word ugliness\nshould be abolished from our language, just as it would be absurd to say that\nthere is no such thing as untruth. Untruth there certainly is, not in the\nsystem of the universe, but in our power of comprehension, as its negative\nelement. In the same manner there is ugliness in the distorted expression of\nbeauty in our life and in our art which comes from our imperfect realisation\nof Truth. To a certain extent we can set our life against the law of truth\nwhich is in us and which is in all, and likewise we can give rise to ugliness\nby going counter to the eternal law of harmony which is everywhere.\n\nThrough our sense of truth we realise law in creation, and through our sense\nof beauty we realise harmony in the universe. When we recognise the law in\nnature we extend our mastery over physical forces and become powerful; when we\nrecognise the law in our moral nature we attain mastery over self and become\nfree. In like manner the more we comprehend the harmony in the physical world\nthe more our life shares the gladness of creation, and our expression of\nbeauty in art becomes more truly catholic. As we become conscious of the\nharmony in our soul, our apprehension of the blissfulness of the spirit of the\nworld becomes universal, and the expression of beauty in our life moves in\ngoodness and love towards the infinite. This is the ultimate object of our\nexistence, that we must ever know that "beauty is truth, truth beauty"; we\nmust realise the whole world in love, for love gives it birth, sustains it,\nand takes it back to its bosom. We must have that perfect emancipation of\nheart which gives us the power to stand at the innermost centre of things and\nhave the taste of that fullness of disinterested joy which belongs to Brahma.\n\nMusic is the purest form of art, and therefore the most direct expression of\nbeauty, with a form and spirit which is one and simple, and least encumbered\nwith anything extraneous. We seem to feel that the manifestation of the\ninfinite in the finite forms of creation is music itself, silent and visible.\nThe evening sky, tirelessly repeating the starry constellations, seems like a\nchild struck with wonder at the mystery of its own first utterance, lisping\nthe same word over and over again, and listening to it in unceasing joy. When\nin the rainy night of July the darkness is thick upon the meadows and the\npattering rain draws veil upon veil over the stillness of the slumbering\nearth, this monotony of the rain patter seems to be the darkness of sound\nitself. The gloom of the dim and dense line of trees, the thorny bushes\nscattered in the bare heath like floating heads of swimmers with bedraggled\nhair, the smell of the damp grass and the wet earth, the spire of the temple\nrising above the undefined mass of blackness grouped around the village huts--\neverything seems like notes rising from the heart of the night, mingling and\nlosing themselves in the one sound of ceaseless rain filling the sky.\n\nTherefore the true poets, they who are seers, seek to express the universe in\nterms of music.\n\nThey rarely use symbols of painting to express the unfolding of forms, the\nmingling of endless lines and colours that goes on every moment on the canvas\nof the blue sky.\n\nThey have their reason. For the man who paints must have canvas, brush and\ncolour-box. The first touch of his brush is very far from the complete idea.\nAnd then when the work is finished the artist is gone, the windowed picture\nstands alone, the incessant touches of love of the creative hand are\nwithdrawn.\n\nBut the singer has everything within him. The notes come out from his very\nlife. They are not materials gathered from outside. His idea and his\nexpression are brother and sister; very often they are born as twins. In music\nthe heart reveals itself immediately; it suffers not from any barrier of alien\nmaterial.\n\nTherefore though music has to wait for its completeness like any other art,\nyet at every step it gives out the beauty of the whole. As the material of\nexpression even words are barriers, for their meaning has to be constructed by\nthought. But music never has to depend upon any obvious meaning; it expresses\nwhat no words can ever express.\n\nWhat is more, music and the musician are inseparable. When the singer departs,\nhis singing dies with him; it is in eternal union with the life and joy of the\nmaster.\n\nThis world-song is never for a moment separated from its singer. It is not\nfashioned from any outward material. It is his joy itself taking never-ending\nform. It is the great heart sending the tremor of its thrill over the sky.\n\nThere is a perfection in each individual strain of this music, which is the\nrevelation of completion in the incomplete. No one of its notes is final, yet\neach reflects the infinite.\n\nWhat does it matter if we fail to derive the exact meaning of this great\nharmony? Is it not like the hand meeting the string and drawing out at once\nall its tones at the touch? It is the language of beauty, the caress, that\ncomes from the heart of the world straightway reaches our heart.\n\nLast night, in the silence which pervaded the darkness, I stood alone and\nheard the voice of the singer of eternal melodies. When I went to sleep I\nclosed my eyes with this last thought in my mind, that even when I remain\nunconscious in slumber the dance of life will still go on in the hushed arena\nof my sleeping body, keeping step with the stars. The heart will throb, the\nblood will leap in the veins, and the millions of living atoms of my body will\nvibrate in tune with the note of the harp-string that thrills at the touch of\nthe master.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII: The Realisation of the Infinite](sadh10.htm)\n\n'
