But as his feet\ntouched the threshold of supreme blessedness there rose to his ears the sound\nof the sorrowful crying of humanity. Then turned that great soul back from\nNirvana and entered again into life, declaring that till the last grain of\ndust in the universe had passed in before him, he would by no means go into\nsalvation. And this Bodhisattva is he who sits on the throne of the Dalai-Lama\nin Tibet, watching the world of men with eyes of divine pity from afar off.\n\nCalled by various names, arrayed in widely, differing garb, we come constantly\nin Hinduism on the attempt, as here in the story of the Dalai-Lama, to express\nthe idea that in the great Heart of the Absolute there dwells an abiding\ncharity towards men. It would seem as if, to the religious instinct\n\np. 206\n\nof humanity, the dream of "the pursuit of the soul by God" is a necessity; and\nthe Hindu, well aware of the impossibility of giving it logical expression,\nveils his effort in mythology. Whence the stories or the Avatars. For our\nconception of the doctrine of reincarnation is only complete when we\nunderstand that now and again the Eternal Love is represented as projecting\nitself into the sphere of manifestation, taking shape as a man, in order to\nact as a lamp amidst the darkness of delusion, a counter-magnetism to the\nattractions of desire.\n\nIt is absurd, says the Hindu--whose imagination can never be charged with\nprovincialism--to think that such an Incarnation, supposing it to occur at\nall, could visit the world only once. Is respect of persons a divine\nattribute? Or is the need of mankind at any time less than complete? Can we\nbelieve, again, that the power of creative energy to assume and throw off the\nshell of personality is exhausted in a single effort? Rather must the taking\nupon Himself of mortal form and limitations be to the all-pervasive "as the\nlifting of a flower\'s fragrance by the summer breeze," a matter of play; or\nlike the shining of a lamp through the window wherein it is set, without\neffort--nothing more.\n\nThe orthodox Hindu is thus usually in no position to deny the supernatural\ncharacter of the Babe of Bethlehem. He is only unable to admit that the nature\nof Christ stands alone in the history of the world, holding that his own\ncountry has seen even more than the three--Rama, Krishna, and Buddha--who were\nHis brothers. Still more cogently does he claim sometimes that all these and\npossibly others of whom he has not heard, are but one soul, one expression of\nGodhead coming back at different times to lay hold on the hearts of men. And\nhe quotes in support of this contention the familiar\n\np. 207\n\nwords of Krishna: "Whenever religion decays, and when irreligion * prevails,\n_then_ I manifest myself. For the protection of the good, for the destruction\nof the evil, for the firm establishment of the _dharmma_ , I am born again and\nagain."\n\nIt is natural enough to the Hindu intellect that around each such forth-\nshining of the Divine should grow up a new religious system or Church. But\neach of these is only a special way of expressing the one fundamental doctrine\nof Maya, a new mode of endearing God to man. At the same time it is thought\nthat every one, while recognising this perfect sympathy of various faiths for\none another, should know how to choose one amongst them for his own, and\npersist in it, till by its means he has reached a point where the formulae of\nsects are meaningless to him. "For it is good," say the people, "to be born in\na church, though it is foolish to die there."\n\nIn this sense--somewhat different from the religious partisanship of Europe--\nthe popular and growing belief of the Hindu masses consists of various forms\nof the worship of Khrishna. It is this creed that carries to those who need\nit, a religious emotionalism like that of the Salvation Army or . of\nMethodism. In the hottest nights, during periods of "revival," the streets of\na city will be crowded with men bearing lights and banners, and dancing\nthemselves into a frenzy to such words as:\n\nCall on the Lord, Call on the Lord,  \nCall on the Lord, little brother  \nThan this name of the Lord,  \nFor mortal man, There is no other way.\n\np. 208\n\nKhrishna, like Rama and like Buddha, is considered to be a special incarnation\nof Vishnu, God the Preserver. It is therefore pertinent to appeal to Him for\nthe goods of life, for consolation in sorrow, for deliverance from fear. He is\nknown as the Holy Child, born in humility amidst cowherds by the Jumna; the\nGentle Shepherd of the People, the Wise Counsellor, the Blessed Lord, tender\nLover and Saviour of the human soul; and by other names not less familiar to\nourselves. It is an image of the Baby Krishna that the Indian mother adores as\nthe Bambino, calling it "Gopala," her cowherd. His name fills gospels and\npoems, the folk-songs of all Hindu races are full of descriptions of Him as a\ncowherd wandering and sporting amongst His fellows; and childish literature is\nfull of stories of Him, curiously like European tales of the Christ-child. To\nthe ecstatic mystic, He is the Divine Spouse.\n\nIf we dip into His history we shall think it a strange medley. So many parts\nwere never surely thrust upon a single figure! But through it all we note the\npredominant Indian characteristics,--absolute detachment from personal ends,\nand a certain subtle and humorous insight into human nature.\n\nHis main spiritual significance for India does not, perhaps--with one\nexception--attach to that part of His life which is related in the\nMahabharata, but rather to what is told of Him in the Puranas--works not\nunlike our apocryphal Gospels. But the one exception is important. It consists\nof no less an incident than that conversation with the chieftain Arjuna which\ncomprises the Bhagavad Gita, or Song of the Blessed One. Of this little poem--\nonly some three or four times the length of the Sermon on the Mount, and\nshorter even than the Gospel of St. Mark--it may be said at once that amongst\nthe\n\np. 209\n\nsacred writings of mankind there is probably no other which is at once so\ngreat, so complete, and so short. It provides the worship of Krishna--and\nincidentally all kindred systems--with that open door upon abstract philosophy\nwithout which no cult could last in India for a week. But it is by no means\nthe property of the Vaishnavas exclusively. From Kashmir to Cape Comorin it is\nbone of the bone and flesh of the flesh of all forms of religious thought.\n\nIts ideas are unmistakably Indian in colour: its _feeling_ is just as\nunmistakably universal. The voice that speaks on the field of Kurukshetra is\nthe same voice that reverberates through an English childhood from the shores\nof the Sea of Galilee. We read the gracious words, "Putting aside all\ndoctrines, come thou to Me alone for shelter--I will liberate thee from all\nsins, do not thou grieve." "Fixing thy heart on Me, thou shalt, by My grace,\ncross over all difficulties," and we drop the book, lost in a dream of One who\ncried to the weary and heavy laden, "Come unto Me." We certainly now\nunderstand, and cannot again forget, that for the Indian reader the eyes of\nthe Lord Krishna are most kind, His touch infinitely gentle, and His heart\nfull of an exceeding great compassion, even as for us are the eyes and the\nhand and the heart of Him Who spoke of Himself as the Good Shepherd.\n\nLike our own Gospels, the Gita abounds in quaint and simple metaphors. "As a\nlamp in a sheltered spot, not flickering," must be the mind. All undertakings\nare surrounded with evil, "as fire with smoke." The round of worship is "as a\nwheel revolving." So great is wisdom that though thou shouldst be "even the\nmost sinful of all sinners, thou shalt cross safely to the conquest of all sin\nby the bark of wisdom alone." One of the most beautiful, referring to those\nperceptions which constitute the Universe as we know it, says, "All this\n\np. 210\n\nis threaded upon Me as gems upon a string." Nothing is mentioned that would\nnot be familiar to the poorest peasant, living on a fertile plain, diversified\nonly by a river and an occasional walled city.\n\nAnd indeed it was for these, labouring men, unlettered and poor, that the\nGita, with its masterly simplicity, was written. To those who had thought\nsalvation and the beatific vision as far beyond their attainment as a\nknowledge of the classics--to these humble souls the Divine Voice declares\nthat, by worshipping God and doing at the same time the duty of his station,\nevery man may attain perfection. "Better for one is one\'s own duty, however\nbadly done, than the duty of another, though that be easy." Again and again,\nas we read the Gita, we are driven to the conclusion that we hear an infinite\nmercy addressing itself to a people who had imagined the knowledge of God to\nbe the monopoly of priesthoods and religious orders, and bidding them be of\ngood courage, for the true monk is he "who neither hates nor desires," the\ntrue worshipper any one who "offers to Me with devotion even a leaf or a\nflower or a cup of water." No wonder that the Indian people, saluting a Divine\nIncarnation, call Him _the Physician of the world-disease!_ Never did speech\nknow how to be more interior. "Those who worship Me, renouncing all actions in\nMe, regarding Me as supreme, meditating on Me with entire devotion, for them\nwhose thought is fixed on Me, I become ere long, O son of Pritha, the Saviour\nout of the ocean of this mortal world." . . . "For I am the abode of Brahman,\nthe Immortal and the Immutable, the Eternal Substance, and the unfailing\nBliss." We kneel in a vast silence and darkness, and hear words falling like\nwater drop by drop.\n\nNothing is omitted from the Gita that the unconsoled\n\np. 211\n\nheart requires. There are even the tender promises of daily bread, so dear to\nthe anxious; "They who depend on Me, putting aside all care, whatsoever they\nneed, I myself carry it to them," runs one verse. Of this a beautiful story is\ntold in the villages. The Brahmin sat copying the text, but when the word\n"carry" had been written, he felt a doubt. "My dear," he said, turning to\nconsult his wife, "thinkest thou not it is irreverent to say \'carry\' here? Did\nnot our Lord not mean \'send?\'" "Beyond a doubt, beloved," answered his wife,\n"it is as thou sayest. Let the word be \'send.\'" Then the man took his penknife\nand erased the word he had just written, substituting his own emendation for\nit. A moment later he rose up to go and bathe. But his wife stood before him\nwith troubled face. "I told thee not," she said, "that there is no food in the\nhouse, and nought have I to cook for thee." The Brahmin smiled gently. "Let us\ncall upon our Lord to fulfil His own promise," he replied quietly; "meantime,\nI shall go and bathe," and he passed into the next room. Only a few minutes\nhad he gone, when his wife was called to the door by a beautiful youth, who\nstood there with a basketful of delicious foods, ready for eating. "Who sent\nme this?" the woman asked in amazement. "Your husband called me to carry it,"\nsaid the lad carelessly, putting the basket as he spoke into her hands. But to\nher horror, as he lifted his arms, the housewife noted cuts and gashes above\nhis heart. "Alas, my poor child, who hath wounded thee?" she cried. "Your\nhusband, mother, before he called me, cut me with a small sharp weapon," was\nthe quiet answer. Dumb with astonishment, the Brahmin\'s wife turned away to\nbestow the viands he had brought, and when she came back to the door the youth\nhad gone. At that instant her husband\n\np. 212\n\nre-entered the room, having returned, as she supposed from bathing. Her wonder\nabout the food was forgotten in indignant sympathy. "Why," she cried, "didst\nthou so hurt thy messenger?" The man looked at her without understanding. "Him\nwhom thou sentest to me with food, as thou didst go to bathe," she explained.\n"To bathe!" he stammered, "I have not yet been!" Then the eyes of husband and\nwife met, and they knew both who had come to them, and how they had wounded\nthe heart of the Lord. And the Brahmin returned to the sacred text, and once\nmore erasing a word restored it to its original form, for there can be no\ndoubt that the true reading is, "They who depend on Me, casting aside all\ncare, whatsoever they need, I myself carry it to them."\n\nSuch are some of the associations which cling to the little image of Krishna\nthat the children about Calcutta can buy for a few farthings. It is made of\nlime, and painted blue--for just as white, to the dweller amongst northern\nsnows, signifies purity, so blue, the colour of sky and ocean, to the child of\nthe South, is the token of the Infinite. The left hand of the image holds a\nflute to the lips; the right carries a thin golden scroll, referring to the\nGita. The feet are crossed carelessly, like those of any strolling peasant-\nplayer, and the head is crowned. Simple toy as it is, there is hardly a detail\nof the composite figure in which a devotional system does not centre.\n\n"O Thou that playest on the flute, standing by the water-ghats, on the road to\nBrindaban!" sing the lovers of Krishna, and their hearts melt within them\nwhile they sing, pierced as by S. Teresa\'s wound of seraphic love. Of all its\nelements, however, there is none which has the unequalled importance to the\nworld of the scroll in the right hand, both as throwing light on Indian habits\nof thought\n\np. 213\n\nand as an exposition of the science of religion. The questions, therefore, On\nwhat fundamental experience does the Gita base itself? To what does it appeal?\nWhat does it single out in life as requiring explanation? What is its main\nimperative? are of singular interest. That place which the four Gospels hold\nto Christendom, the Gita holds to the world of Hinduism, and in a very real\nsense, to understand it is to understand India and the Indian people.\n\nII\n\nIt is believed by Hindus that when great forces are in action, on occasions\nsuch as those of battle and earthquake, a certain state of etheric vibration\nis produced, which makes it easy for minds trembling on the verge of supreme\nknowledge to vault the barricades of sense and find illumination. Perhaps this\nis because a great intensity of experience has to be found and transcended.\nPerhaps the conditions, apparently simple, are really more complex than this.\nAt any rate, the story of the Bhagavad Gita is of the coming of such beatitude\nto a young soldier named Arjuna, some three thousand years ago.\n\nIncidentally, the opening of the poem presents us with an impressive picture\nof an ancient battlefield. On the great plain of Kurukshetra, already the\nscene of the prayers and austerities of saints and pilgrims for hundreds of\nyears, two armies face each other. The leaders of both sides occupy chariots\ndrawn by white horses; over each waves his personal ensign; and each carries a\nconch-shell, by way of trumpet, to enable him to give signals and enforce\nattention to his commands. Both armies are represented as great hosts, but\nindications are not wanting that that of Duryodhana, the usurper, under the\nleadership\n\np. 214\n\nof Bhishma, is the larger and stronger. And this is natural, since Duryodhana,\nrightly or wrongly, is still suzerain of the whole country, while the five\nPandava brothers, his cousins, are only bent on the recovery of their rights\nfrom him. We have to call to mind that this is an ancient battle, consisting\nof an immense number of small fights, before we are able to give our thoughts\ncalmly to the narrative, for we are told that from all parts of the field and\non both sides the white conch-shells have been blown, giving the signal for\nassault, and that already "the discharge of weapons" has begun, when Arjuna\nrequests Krishna, who is acting as his charioteer, to drive him into the space\nbetween the two hosts, that he may single out those with whom he is to enter\ninto personal combat during the fray.\n\nThe sight of the foe, however, has an extraordinary effect on the mind of the\nchieftain. Instead of looking on his enemies with an accession of faith in the\njustice of his own cause and a heroic determination to struggle to the last in\nits defence, he seems to realise for the first time the consequences of the\nattack. Amongst the foe stand all he has ever loved or honoured--Bhishma, the\nhead of his house, the adored grandsire of his childhood; Drona, to whom he\nowes his education, and for whom he cherishes a passionate reverence; and\ncousins and relatives innumerable besides, of whom the very worst is an old\nplayfellow or a gallant combatant in tourney. The path to victory lies through\nthe burning-ghat of the dead! The ashes of all he loves are scattered there!\nAs he realises this, Arjuna\'s great bow slips from his hand, and he sinks to\nthe floor of his chariot in despair. We must remember that this is no mere\nfailure of courage. The soldier has been tried and proved too often to be open\nfor a moment to such an imputation. Neither is he represented as entertaining\nthe slightest doubt of ultimate\n\np. 215\n\ntriumph. To the fortunes of war he gives not a thought, assuming, as do all\nbrave men, that they must follow the right. He simply realises that for the\nsake of a few years of dominion he is about, with his own hand, to rid the\nearth of everything he loves. He realises, too, that this widespread slaughter\nwill constitute an enormous social disaster.\n\nThis feeling of Arjuna\'s finds religious expression. "I desire not victory, O\nKrishna, neither kingdom nor pleasures. . . . It would be better for me if the\nsons of Dritarashthra, arms in hand, should slay me, unarmed and unresisting,\nin the battle." Surely the moral situation is finely conceived! A prince, of\nthe proudest lineage on earth, is eager to be offered up as a sacrifice rather\nthan accept empire at the price to be paid for it. On the battlefield of life\ndoes any case need better stating? Yet this thirst for martyrdom, which looks\nso like renunciation, is really quite another thing. "Thou art grieved for\nthose who require no grief, yet thou speakest words of wisdom," says Krishna.\nFor, instead of the actual indifference to the world and to his own part in\nit, of one who perceives that all before him is unreal, Arjuna is betraying\nthat determination to maintain things as they are which belongs to those who\nhold that affection at least is a very actual good. It is on this distinction\nthat the whole treatise is based.\n\nAt first, indeed, the charioteer affects to meet the chieftain\'s hesitation\nwith all the contempt of knighthood for panic. "Yield not to unmanliness, O\nson of Pritha!" he exclaims. "Ill doth it become thee. Cast off this base\nweakness, and arise, O terror of foes." It is not till Arjuna, with a touching\nacknowledgment of grief and confusion, makes a supreme appeal for intellectual\nenlightenment, that Krishna, in the character of divine teacher, enters on\nthat immortal pronouncement regarding the Real and\n\np. 216\n\nunreal, which ends by sending the knight back to the duty of his birth,\nunshrinking, with the words: "Firm, with undoubting mind, I obey Thy word."\n\nAs the dialogue proceeds, the dramatic element disappears. The echoes of\nbattle die away. We are standing alone in some chamber of the soul, holding\nthat colloquy between human and divine, finite and infinite, which never\nceases during life for any one of us, however little able we may be to\ndisentangle it from the voices of the world. At the culminating moment of the\ninterview, when the worshipper receives the sudden revelation of all existing\nin and by the Lord Krishna, as mere multiform expressions of His sole energy,\neven at this moment, and during the rapt and broken praise which follows it,\nwe find nothing discordant in the _mise-en-sc ene_. A chariot of war has\nbecome, as only a Hindu pen could have made it, silent as any cell of\nmeditation. The corner of a battlefield has grown as remote from the whirl of\nlife as the inmost recesses of a heart at prayer.\n\nThe main argument is, as we might expect, that as all appearances are\ndelusive, action is to the wise man indifferent, and should be performed, once\nhe is sure that he is called to it, without fear of consequences. "Him the\nwise call a sage--the man whose undertakings are all devoid alike of objects\nand desires, whose acts have been burnt to ashes in the fire of wisdom."\n"Never did I not exist, nor thou, nor these rulers of men; and no one of us\nwill ever hereafter cease to exist." Therefore, "Free from hope and from\nselfishness, without any anxiety of mind, plunge thou into battle!"\n\nThe words are addressed to one who is preeminently a man of action, a soldier\n--supposed, saving a due regard for his military honour, to be swayed by the\npassion for justice, and the impulse to defend it. These things being the\nstake, throw\n\np. 217\n\nfor them, and throw boldly, says Krishna, and as results, take whatever may\nchance to come. "Man has always the right to work: man has no right to the\nresults of work," is as much the heart and core of the Gita, as "Thou hast no\nright to success if thou art not also equal to failure," is of Stoicism. In\napplication the two doctrines seem identical, but we have only to read, in\norder to see the advantage which the idea of Maya gives to the Indian thinker.\nClear, sharp, incisive as chisel-strokes, are the utterances of Epictetus:\nlike thunderbolts out of a tropical night the words of Krishna.\n\nThe Gita, however, does not consist of a single chain of reasoning, moving in\ndefinite progression from beginning to end. Rather is the same thing said over\nand over again, in as many different ways as possible. Sometimes even a form\nof words is repeated, as if nothing mattered save to make the meaning clear.\nThere is ample scope here for the digressive energy of ages, of which the\noutcome is the richly-woven texture, set here and there with those strangely-\ncut Oriental jewels, which must remain amongst the greatest recorded words of\nreligion to all time.\n\nBut readers will completely miss the sense of the Gita who permit themselves\nto forget its first ringing words: "Yield not to unmanliness, O son of Pritha!\nIll doth it become thee. Shake off this base weakness, and arise, O terror of\nfoes!" The book is nowhere a call to leave the world, but everywhere an\ninterpretation of common life as the path to that which lies beyond. "Better\nfor a man is his own duty, however badly done, than the duty of another,\nthough that be easy." "Holding gain and loss as one, _prepare for battle_."\nThat the man who throws away his weapons, and permits himself to be slain,\nunresisting, in the battle, is _not_ the hero of religion, but a sluggard and\na coward; that the\n\np. 218\n\ntrue seer is he who carries his vision into action, regardless of the\nconsequences to himself; this is the doctrine of the Gita, repeated again and\nagain. The book is really a battle-cry. Spirituality is with it no retreat\nfrom men and things, but a burning fire of knowledge that destroys bondage,\nconsumes sluggishness and egoism, and penetrates everywhere. Not the\nwithdrawn, but the transfigured life, radiant with power and energy,\ntriumphant in its selflessness, is religion.\n\nThe Gita is to-day the gospel of the Indian Revival. And never was book so\nwell suited to such function. For its eighteen chapters are the expression of\nan overwhelming national vitality. It is as true of peoples as of individuals,\nthat when the age is full and rich, living is apt to outrun knowing. It is\nthen that large questions press for solution. Great areas of experience\nrequire to be related to their common centre and to each other. And so pre-\neminently does the Gita do this, that the Mussulman and the Christian can sit\nindifferently with the Hindu to gather its interpretations.\n\nThe nature of all faith, the relation of all worship to worshipped and\nworshipper, the dependence of knowledge on non-attachment under all its forms:\nit is with problems like these, and not with any particular _Credo_ , that the\nGita concerns itself. It is at once therefore the smallest and most\ncomprehensive of the scriptures of the world.\n\nThat indifference to results is the condition of efficient action is the first\npoint in its philosophy. But there is no doubt that the action should be\nstrenuous. Let every muscle be hard, every limb well-knit, let the mind sweep\nthe whole horizon of fact; with the reins in hand, the fiery steeds under\ncontrol, with the whole battlefield in view, and the will of the hero lifted\nhigh to strike for justice,\n\np. 219\n\n[paragraph continues] "Arise!" thunders the voice of Sri Krishna, "and be thou\nan apparent cause!"\n\nIt is the supreme imperative. Play thy whole part in the drama of time,\ndevoting every energy, concentrating the whole force. "As the ignorant act\nfrom selfish motives, so should the wise man act, unselfishly."\n\nJust as the child sees the sun above his head, and the earth beneath his feet,\ndistinguishing himself from both, while to the man of science, sun, planet,\nand child are all single points in a great ocean of force-matter, absolutely\ncontinuous from its centre to its farthest bounds, so to us all, in the sense-\nplane of thought, God, soul, and relation exist. Having reached that truth,\nhowever, which is the Beatific Vision, any one of them will seem the whole,\nfor all conception of limitation will be \'blotted out. As we ourselves are\nseen to be but light transformed; as thought and perception, life and motion,\nsun and planet, are all but different manifestations of a something that we\ncall Solar Energy, so God, self, and universe, are now known to be only\ndistinctions made by sense in that one, Brahman, "the immortal and immutable,\nthe eternal substance, and the unfailing Bliss."\n\nAn account of such a vision gives us the culminating chapter of the Gita.\nKrishna suddenly bursts forth on the sight of his astonished worshipper as the\nUniversal Form, in Whom all that exists in one. Characteristically Indian in\nexpression, full of the blaze and terror of the cosmos, this great scene can\nonly perhaps be thoroughly appreciated by a Western mind if it has first\nunderstood something of the craving that it fulfils, caught some flash maybe\nof the radiance it describes. Yet if the rest of the Gita were destroyed, this\none chapter might take its place, for it makes all its logic actual.\n\np. 220\n\n[paragraph continues] Arjuna\'s single sight becomes the sacrament of a whole\nworld\'s hope.\n\nIt was midnight when I reached Thaneswar. The fierce white light of a tropical\nmoon bathed the great common in front, where only trees and bushes, with their\ncoal-black shadows, could be seen, and not a single human habitation was in\nsight. Behind, the dak-bungalow lay in darkness, and the train by which I had\ncome had passed on long ago into the night. One was alone on the Plain of\nKurukshetra with three thousand years.\n\nBut the silence did not remain unbroken. Clear and distinct on the still air\nrose the accents of the immortal dialogue. "Man has the right to work: man has\nno right to the fruits of work," said, once more, the divine Charioteer. Yet\nmany a memorable battle has been fought, India herself has heard a thousand\ndialogues, preaching the truths of the Bhagavad Gita. Why, asked my heart,\ndoes one come to this spot? For what thing, above all others, does the world\nremember Kurukshetra?\n\nAnd then I saw why, never to forget. Kurukshetra was the place of the Great\nVision, the field of the Divine Illumination of Arjuna.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[207:*](wil15.htm#fr_36) Literally, dharmma and a-dharmma.
