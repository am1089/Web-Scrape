If there are four sons of a Brahma _n_ a (springing from four different\nwives) of the four castes, they shall divide the whole estate of their father\ninto ten parts.\n\n2\\. Of these, let the soil of the Brahma _n_ a wife take four parts;\n\n3\\. The son of the Kshatriya wife, three parts;\n\n4\\. The son of the Vai _s_ ya wife, two parts;\n\n5\\. The son of the _S_ udra wife, a single part.\n\n[22. My rendering of this Sloka is based upon Kulluka's interpretation of the\nidentical passage of Manu (IX, 200), which is supported by Vi _g_ \xc3\xb1anesvara\n(Mitakshara I, 4, 19 in Colebrooke's version), Madhava (Burnell, Daya-Vibhaga\n51), Varadara _g_ a (Burnell, Varadara _g_ a's Vyavaharanir _n_ aya 49), and\nothers. Nand. proposes a different interpretation, on which rests Dr. Buhler's\nrendering, 'Those ornaments, which the wives usually wear, should not be\ndivided by the heirs whilst the husbands are alive.'\n\nXVIII. 1-5.

Again, if there are three sons of a Brahma _n_ a (by wives of different\ncastes), but no son by a _S_ udra (wife) among them, they shall divide the\nestate into nine parts.\n\n7\\. (Of these) let them take, each in the order of his caste, shares amounting\nto four, three, and two parts of the whole respectively.\n\n8\\. (If there are three sons by wives of different castes, but) no Vai _s_ ya\namong them, they shall divide the estate into eight parts, and take four\nparts, three parts, and one part respectively.\n\n9\\. (If there are three sons, but) no Kshatriya among them, they shall divide\nit into seven parts, and take four parts, two parts, and a single part\nrespectively.\n\n10\\. If there is no Brahma _n_ a, among them, they hall divide it into six\nparts, and take three parts, two parts, and a single part respectively.\n\n11\\. If there are sons of a Kshatriya by a Kshatriya, a Vai _s_ ya, and a _S_\nudra wife, the mode of division shall be the same (i.e. the estate shall be\ndivided into six parts, &c.)\n\n12\\. Again, if there are two sons of a Brahma _n_ a, the one belonging to the\nBrahma _n_ a and the other to the Kshatriya caste, they shall divide the\nestate into seven parts; and of these the Brahma _n_ a son shall take four\nparts;\n\n13\\. The Kshatriya son, three parts.\n\n14\\. Again, if there are two sons of a Brahma _n_ a, and the one belongs to\nthe Brahma _n_ a and the other to the Vai _s_ ya caste, the estate shall be\ndivided into six parts; and of these, the Brahma _n_ a shall take four parts;\n\n15\\. The Vai _s_ ya, two parts.\n\np. 72\n\n10\\. Again, if there are two sons of a Brahma _n_ a, and the one belongs to\nthe Brahma _n_ a and the other to the _S_ udra caste, they shall divide the\nestate into five parts;\n\n17\\. And of these, the Brahma _n_ a shall take four parts;\n\n18\\. The _S_ udra, a single part.\n\n19\\. Again, if there are two sons of a Brahma _n_ a or a Kshatriya, and the\none belongs to the Kshatriya and the other to the _S_ udra caste, they shall\ndivide the estate into five parts;\n\n90\\. And of these, the Kshatriya shall take three parts;\n\n21\\. The _S_ udra, one part.\n\n22\\. Again, if there are two sons of a Brahma _n_ a or a Kshatriya, and the\none belongs to the Kshatriya, the other to the _S_ udra caste, they shall\ndivide the estate into four parts;\n\n23\\. And of these, the Kshatriya shall take three parts;\n\n24\\. The _S_ udra, a single part.\n\n25\\. Again, if there are two sons of a Brahma _n_ a or a Vai _s_ ya or a _S_\nudra, and the one belongs to the Vai _s_ ya, the other to the _S_ udra caste,\nthey shall divide the estate into three parts;\n\n26\\. And of these, the Vai _s_ ya shall take two parts;\n\n27\\. The _S_ udra, a single part,\n\n28\\. If a Brahma _n_ a has an only son, he shall take the whole estate,\nprovided he be a Brahma _n_ a, Kshatriya, or Vai _s_ ya.\n\n29\\. If a Kshatriya has (an only son who is) either a Kshatriya or a Vai _s_\nya, (the rule shall be the same.)\n\np. 73\n\n30\\. If a Vai _s_ ya has (an only son who is) Vai _s_ ya, (the rule shall also\nbe the same);\n\n31\\. (And so shall the only) son of a _S_ udra (be sole heir) to his _S_ udra\n(father).\n\n32\\. A _S_ udra, who is the only son of a father belonging to a twice-born\ncaste, shall inherit one-half of his property;\n\n33\\. The other half shall devolve in the same way as the property of one who\ndied without leaving issue.\n\n34\\. Mothers shall receive shares proportionate to their son's shares;\n\n35\\. And so shall unmarried daughters.\n\n36\\. Sons, who are equal in caste (to their father), shall receive equal\nshares.\n\n37\\. A best part (the twentieth part of the inheritance, &c.) shall be given\nto the eldest, as his additional share.\n\n38\\. If there are two sons by a Brahma _n_ a and one by a _S_ udra wife, the\nestate shall be divided into nine parts; and of these, the two sons of the\nBrahma _n_ a wife shall take two parts, the one son of the _S_ udra wife, a\nsingle part.\n\n39\\. If there are two sons by a _S_ udra, and one son by a Brahma _n_ a wife,\nthe estate shall be divided into six parts; and of these, the son of the\nBrahma _n_ a wife shall take four parts, and the two sons of the _S_ udra wife\ntogether shall take two parts.\n\n40\\. Upon the same principles the shares have to be adjusted in other cases\nalso.\n\n[33. See XVII, 4 seq.\n\n34\\. 'That is to say, a Brahma _n_ a wife shall take four parts, a Kshatriya\nwife, three parts,' &c. (Nand.)\n\n37\\. See Gaut. XXVIII, 5.]\n\np. 74\n\n41\\. If (brothers), who after a previous division of the estate live again\ntogether as parceners, should make a second partition, the shares must be\nequal in that case, and the eldest has no right to an additional share.\n\n42\\. What a brother has acquired by, his own efforts, without using the\npatrimony, he must not give up (to his brothers or other co-heirs), unless by\nhis own free will; for it was gained by his own exertion.\n\n43\\. And if a man recovers (a debt or other property), which could not before\nbe recovered by his father, he shall not, unless by his own free will, divide\nit with his sons; for it is an acquisition made by himself.\n\n44\\. Apparel, vehicles[1] (carriages or riding-horses), and ornaments (such as\nare usually worn according to the custom of the caste), prepared food, water\n(in a well or pool), females (slaves or mistresses of the deceased), property\ndestined for pious uses or sacrifices, a common pasture-ground[2], and a book,\nare indivisible.\n\n[42. The term svayamihitalabdham has been translated according to Kulluka (on\nM. IX, 208). Nand. interprets this _S_ loka thus, 'What a brother has acquired\nby his own efforts, and what has been given to him, at his desire (by friends\nor others), he must not give up,' &c.\n\n43\\. Here again I have followed Kulluka (on M. IX, 209), and deviated from\nNand.'s interpretation, who renders this Sloka as follows, 'If a man recovers\nproperty, &c., or if he gains property by himself (by his learning or valour,\n&c.) . . . '\n\n44\\. 1 The term pattra has been rendered above in accordance with the first\ninterpretation proposed by Nand., and with Kulluka's interpretation (on M. IX,\n219). Vi _g_ \xc3\xb1ane _s_ vara (in his comment upon the same passage of Manu)\nrefers it to written documents, such especially as relate to a debt to be paid\nto the deceased; and {footnote p. 75} this interpretation is mentioned by\nNand. also. But there is no reason why an unliquidated demand should not be\ndivided; and written documents are only twice referred to in the code of Manu\n(VIII, 168, and IX, 232).--2 in translating the term pra _k_ ara I have again\nfollowed Kulluka loc. cit.; see also Petersburg Dictionary s. v. Nand.\ninterprets this term as denoting 'a path leading to or from the house.']\n\np. 75\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIX.](sbe07021.htm)\n\n"
