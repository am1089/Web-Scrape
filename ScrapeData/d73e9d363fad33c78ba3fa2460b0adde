Vyasa said :-- O King! That powerful son of Lak _s_ mi, Haihaya, became\nvery glad to hear these words of Yas\xc2\x92ovati and said :--\n\n\n\n2-14. O One of beautiful thighs! Hear in reply to your query :-- I am Haihaya,\nthe son of Lak _s_ mi, and I am known in this world by the name of Ekavira.\nNow you have made my mind dependent. What am I to do now? where to go? Thus\ndistressed with bereavement from your dear companion, my mind is struck with\nCupid\xc2\x92s arrows and is confounded with her extraordinary beauty that you just\nnow described. Next you described her qualifications and my mind is ravished.\nAgain when you described before me what she uttered in the presence of the Rak\n_s_ asa, I am struck with great wonder. Your dear companion Ekavali said\nbefore the vicious Danava Kalaketu, \xc2\x93I have already selected the King Haihaya.\nI will not select any other than him, this is my firm resolve.\xc2\x94 These words\nhave converted me into her slave. O sweet-haired One! Say now what service can\nI do to you both? I am not acquainted with that wicked demon\xc2\x92s palace; never I\nwent to his city. O Fair-eyed One! Say how I can go there; for you are the\nonly one that can lead me there. Therefore take me quickly to that place where\nyour beautiful clear companion is staying. Your dear companion, the daughter\nof the King is very much afflicted with sorrow; soon I will free her, by\ndestroying that cruel Rak _s_ asa. There is no doubt in this. O Auspicious\nOne! I will rescue your dear companion and bring her to the city of yours and\nhand her over to the hands of her father. Then that King, the enemy destroyer,\nwill perform the marriage ceremony of his daugther. I think this is the desire\nof your heart. O Sweet-speaking One! Know that that is also my desire. O\nBeautiful One! Now that desire will be fulfilled by your efforts. Show me\nquickly that place and see my prowess. O One with a face beautiful like the\nMoon! It seems that you will be able to do my work. Soon do such as I can kill\nthat wicked demon, who steals others\xc2\x92 wives. Now show me the way to the\nimpassable city of that Rak _s_ asa.\n\n\n\n15-26. Vyasa said :--O King! Hearing the sweet words of the prince, Yas\xc2\x92ovati\nbecame very glad and gently began to speak out how he could go to the demon\xc2\x92s\ncity. O King! Take the success-giving Mantra of Bhagavati and I would then be\nable to show you today the city guarded by the Rak _s_ asas. O King! Better\narrange to take your vast\n\n\n\np. 565\n\n\n\narmy with you; for you will have to fight no sooner you go there. Kalaketu is\npersonally a great warrior surrounded by Rak _s_ asas of great power and\nstrength. Therefore be initiated in the Mantram of S\xc2\x92ri Bhagavati and\naccompany me. So you will surely be successful. I will show you the way to the\ncity of that Demon. Slay that vicious and vilest of the Rak _s_ asas and\nrescue my dear companion. Hearing thus, Haihaya was duly initiated into the\ngreat Mantram of Yoges\xc2\x92vari, named Trilokitilaka Mantra (Hrim Gauri\nRudradayite Yoge S\xc2\x92vari Hum Pha _t_ Svaha is the Yoges\xc2\x92vari Mantra), by Mahar\n_s_ i Dattatreya, accidentally come there (as if ordained by Fate), the chief\nof J\xc3\xb1anins (the Gnostics), that is conducive to the welfare of the beings.\nThus by the influence of the Mantram the King got the power of knowing all\nthings and going everywhere with unobstructed speed. Then the King Haihaya\nquickly went with Yas\xc2\x92ovati to the impassable city of the Rak _s_ asas,\naccompanied by a vast army. The city was surrounded by snakes and guarded by\nthe terrible Rak _s_ asas like the city of Patala. The messengers of the Rak\n_s_ asa, seeing the King coming, were struck with terror and crying aloud\nquickly went to Kalaketu. Kalaketu, struck with Cupid\xc2\x92s arrows, was sitting\nbeside Ekavali and was speaking many modest words when the messenger went\nthere suddenly and said :-- \xc2\x93O King! The attendant of this lady Yas\xc2\x92ovati is\ncoming here with a prince and an army.\n\n\n\n27-29. O King! We cannot tell exactly whether the prince is the son of Indra,\nnamed Jayanta or Kartikeya. After all, puffed up with the strength of his\narmy, he is coming here. O King! The battle is imminent; now make your\narrangements fully and carefully; fight with the son of a Deva or abandon this\nlotus-eyed Lady. O King! At a distance of three Yojanas from this place, be is\nstaying with his army. Now equip yourself and quickly declare the war by\nblowing the war trumpets.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n30-36. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing the messenger\xc2\x92s words, Kalaketu, the\nKing of the Demons, became overwhelmed with anger and at once sent many\npowerful Rak _s_ asas, holding all sorts of weapons and spoke out to them :--\n\xc2\x93O Rak _s_ asas! With weapons in your hands, go before them quickly.\xc2\x94 Ordering\nthem thus, Kalaketu asked in sweet words Ekavali who was in front and very\ndistressed. O Thin-bellied One! Who is coming here? Is he your father or any\nother man coming with his army to release you. Speak this to me truly. If your\nfather comes here to take you back, being very much distressed with your\nbereavement, I will never fight with him, if I come to know this truly; rather\nI will bring him to my house and worship him with the excel-\n\n\n\np. 566\n\n\n\nlent horses, gems and jewels and clothings. Really I will show my full\nhospitality duly to him when he comes here. And if any other person comes,\nthen I will take his life by the sharpened arrows; there is no doubt in this.\nKnow this as certain whoever comes here for your rescue is brought by the hand\nof Death to me. Therefore, O Large-eyed One! Say who is this fool that is\ncoming, not knowing me as the powerful and unconquerable Kala (Death).\n\n\n\n37-38. Ekavali said :-- \xc2\x93O Highly Fortunate One! I do not know who is this\nbody coming to this side with a violent speed. O King! How can I know that\nwhen I am in this state of confinement in your house. This man is not my\nfather nor my brother. Some other powerful man is coming here. I do not know\nexactly what for he is coming.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n39-40. The Demon said :-- My messengers say that your comrade Yas\xc2\x92ovati has\ntaken with her that warrior and is coming to this side with great energy.\nWhere has your clever companion gone now? O Lotus-eyed! There is no enemy in\nthe three worlds strong enough to fight against me.\n\n\n\n41-66. Vyasa said :-- O King! Just then other messengers hurriedly came there\nterrified and spoke to Kalaketu who had been staying in the house, thus :-- \xc2\x93O\nKing! The army has come quite close to the city and how are you staying in the\nhouse, calm and quiet? Better march out of the city with your vast army as\nearly as possible.\xc2\x94 The powerful Kalaketu, then, hearing their words, mounted\non the chariot and quickly went out of his city. The King Haihaya, on the\nother hand, suffering from the bereavements of his dear lady, suddenly came\nthere mounted on horseback. The terrible fight ensued then and there between\nthe two and each one struck the other with sharpened weapons and the quarters\nall around blazed with their glitterings and clashings. When the terrible\nfight was going on, Haihaya, the son of Lak _s_ mi, struck Kalaketu, the King\nof the Daityas with a very powerful club (Gada). Thus struck by the Gada, the\nLord of the Daityas fell on the ground like a mountain, struck by lightning,\nand died. All the Rak _s_ asas fled away on all sides, struck with terror.\nYas\xc2\x92ovati went then very hurriedly with a gladdened heart to Ekavali and began\nto speak to her in terms of surprise and in sweet words :-- O Dear! O Dear!\nCome, Come; the great warrior, the prince Ekavira has killed the Lord of the\nDaityas in a dreadful battle. That King is now waiting, tired in the midst of\nhis soldiers. He has already heard from me about your beauty and qualities;\nand now he is expecting to see you. O One Looking askance! Now satisfy your\neyes and mind by seeing that King who is like the Cupid. When\n\n\n\np. 567\n\n\n\nI described to him before on the banks of the Ganges your beauty and\nqualifications, he got enamoured of you and now he is suffering from\nbereavements and wants to see you. Thus, hearing, Ekavali determined to go to\nhim and as she was yet unmarried, she became abashed and afraid. She thought\nhow could she see the prince as she was unmarried. It might be that he being\npassionate would catch her by her arms. Thus, troubled with thought, that\ndaughter of the King, with a sad look, and wearing poor clothes, Ekavali went\nwith Yas\xc2\x92ovati on a palanquin, carried on men\xc2\x92s shoulders. Seeing that large-\neyed daughter of the King coming there, the prince said :-- \xc2\x93O Beautiful One!\nMy two eyes are very thirsty to see you. Satisfy my eyes and mind by showing\nyourself to me.\xc2\x94 Seeing the prince passionate and the King\xc2\x92s daughter very\nmuch abashed, Yas\xc2\x92ovati, who knew the rules of modesty, thus spoke to the\nprince :-- \xc2\x93 O Prince! The father of my dear companion expressed a desire to\nbetroth her to your hands. She is also obedient to you. Therefore your meeting\nwill certainly take place. O King! Wait; take her to her father; and he will\nperform duly the marriage ceremony and betroth her to your hands. Know this to\nbe quite certain.\xc2\x94 The King took her words to be quite just and true and\ntaking those two ladies went with his army to the house of the father of\nEkavali. Ekavali\xc2\x92s father became very glad and cheerful to learn that his\ndaughter was coming and, accompanied by his ministers, went hurriedly to her.\nAfter a long time the King saw his daughter in poor clothings and became\nhighly pleased. Yas\xc2\x92ovati then described in detail all what happened before\nthe King. The King then with his minister brought with great love, courtesy\nand gentleness Ekavira to his house and on an auspicious day performed the\nmarriage ceremony of him with Ekavali, in accordance with due ceremonies and\nrites. Then the King gave away many clothings, ornaments, jewels, and articles\nfor fitting a house and many other things and worshipped duly and sent his\ndaughter together with Yas\xc2\x92ovati away with the King Haihaya. Thus the marriage\nceremony was performed and the son of Lak _s_ mi gladly returned to his house\nand began to enjoy many pleasures with his wife. Then, in course of time, in\nthe womb of Ekavali the King Haihaya got a son named Kritavirya. The son of\nthis Kritavirya is known as Kartavirya. O King! Thus I have narrated to you\nthe origin of the Haihaya dynasty.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-third Chapter in the Sixth Book on the battle of Haihaya\nand Kalaketu in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam by Mahar _s_ i\nVeda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 24](bk06ch24.htm)\n\n'
