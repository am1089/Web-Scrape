The internal Ruler (referred to) in the clauses with respect to the gods,\nwith respect to the worlds, &c. (is the highest Self), because the attributes\nof that are designated.\n\nThe Va _g_ asaneyins, of the Ka _n_ wa as well as the Madhyandina branch, have\nthe following text: 'He who\n\np. 279\n\ndwelling in the earth is within the earth, whom the earth does not know, whose\nbody the earth is, who rules the earth within, he is thy Self, the ruler\nwithin, the Immortal.' The text thereupon extends this teaching as to a being\nthat dwells in things, is within them, is not known by them, has them for its\nbody and rules them; in the first place to all divine beings, viz. water,\nfire, sky, air, sun, the regions, moon, stars, ether, darkness, light; and\nnext to all material beings, viz. breath, speech, eye, ear, mind, skin,\nknowledge, seed--closing each section with the words, 'He is thy Self, the\nruler within, the Immortal.' The Madhyandinas, however, have three additional\nsections, viz. 'He who dwells in all worlds,' &c.; 'he who dwells in all\nVedas,' &c.; 'He who dwells in all sacrifices'; and, moreover, in place of 'He\nwho dwells in knowledge' (vi _g_ \xc3\xb1ana) they read 'He who dwells in the Self.'\n--A doubt here arises whether the inward Ruler of these texts be the\nindividual Self or the highest Self.\n\nThe individual Self, the Purvapakshin maintains. For in the supplementary\npassage(which follows upon the text considered so far) the internal Ruler is\ncalled the 'seer' and 'hearer,' i.e. his knowledge is said to depend on the\nsense-organs, and this implies the view that the 'seer' only (i.e. the\nindividual soul only) is the inward Ruler; and further the clause 'There is no\nother seer but he' negatives any other seer.\n\nThis view is set aside by the Sutra. The Ruler within, who is spoken of in the\nclauses marked in the text by the terms 'with respect of the gods,' 'with\nrespect of the worlds,' &c., is the highest Self free from all evil, Naraya\n_n_ a. The Sutra purposely joins the two terms 'with respect to the gods' and\n'with respect to the worlds' in order to intimate that, in addition to the\nclauses referring to the gods and beings(bhuta) exhibited by the _K_ anva-\ntext, the Madhyandina-text contains additional clauses referring to the\nworlds, Vedas, &c. The inward Ruler spoken of in both these sets of passages\nis the highest Self; for attributes of that Self are declared in the text. For\nit is a clear attribute of the highest Self that being one only\n\np. 280\n\nit rules all worlds, all Vedas, all divine beings, and so on. Uddalaka asks,\n'Dost thou know that Ruler within who within rules this world and the other\nworld and all beings? &c.--tell now that Ruler within'; and Ya _g \xc3\xb1_avalkya\nreplies with the long passus, 'He who dwells in the earth,' &c., describing\nthe Ruler within as him who, abiding within all worlds, all beings, all\ndivinities, all Vedas, and all sacrifices, rules them from within and\nconstitutes their Self, they in turn constituting his body. Now this is a\nposition which can belong to none else but the highest Person, who is all-\nknowing, and all whose purposes immediately realise themselves. That it is the\nhighest Self only which rules over all and is the Self of all, other\nUpanishad-texts also declare; cp. e.g. 'Entered within, the ruler of\ncreatures, the Self of all'; 'Having sent forth this he entered into it.\nHaving entered it he became sat and tyat,' &c. (Taitt. Up. II, 6). Similarly\nthe text from the Subala-Up., which begins, 'there was not anything here in\nthe beginning,' and extends up to 'the one God, Naraya _n_ a,' shows that it\nis the highest Brahman only which rules all, is the Self of all, and has all\nbeings for its body. Moreover, essential immortality (which the text ascribes\nto the Ruler within) is an attribute of the highest Self only.--Nor must it be\nthought that the power of seeing and so on that belongs to the highest Self is\ndependent on sense-organs; it rather results immediately from its essential\nnature, since its omniscience and power to realise its purposes are due to its\nown being only. In agreement herewith scripture says, 'He sees without eyes,\nhe hears without ears, without hands and feet he grasps and hastes' ( _S_ vet.\nUp. III, 19). What terms such as 'seeing' and 'hearing' really denote is not\nknowledge in so far as produced by the eye and ear, but the intuitive\npresentation of colour and sound. In the case of the individual soul, whose\nessentially intelligising nature is obscured by karman, such intuitive\nknowledge arises only through the mediation of the sense-organs; in the case\nof the highest Self, on the other hand, it springs from its own nature.--\nAgain, the clause 'there is no other seer but he'\n\np. 281\n\nmeans that there is no seer other than the seer and ruler described in the\npreceding clauses. To explain. The clauses 'whom the earth does not know,'\n&c., up to 'whom the Self does not know' mean to say that the Ruler within\nrules without being perceived by the earth, Self, and the other beings which\nhe rules. This is confirmed by the subsequent clauses, 'unseen but a seer',\n'unheard but a hearer,' &c. And the next clauses, 'there is no other seer but\nhe,' &c., then mean to negative that there is any other being which could be\nviewed as the ruler of that Ruler. Moreover, the clauses 'that is the Self of\nthee,' 'He is the Self of thee' exhibit the individual Self in the genitive\nform ('of thee'), and thus distinguish it from the Ruler within, who is\ndeclared to be their Self.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 20.
