(The Self) consisting of bliss (is the highest Self) on account of the\nrepetition (of the word 'bliss,' as denoting the highest Self).\n\nThe Taittiriya-upanishad (II, 1-5), after having enumerated the Self\nconsisting of food, the Self consisting of the vital airs, the Self consisting\nof mind, and the Self consisting of understanding, says, 'Different from this\nwhich consists of understanding is the other inner Self which consists of\nbliss.' Here the doubt arises whether the phrase, 'that which consists of\nbliss,' denotes the highest Brahman of which it had been said previously, that\n'It is true Being, Knowledge, without end,' or something different from\nBrahman, just as the\n\np. 65\n\n[paragraph continues] Self consisting of food, &c., is different from it.--The\npurvapakshin maintains that the Self consisting of bliss is a secondary (not\nthe principal) Self, and something different from Brahman; as it forms a link\nin a series of Selfs, beginning with the Self consisting of food, which all\nare not the principal Self. To the objection that even thus the Self\nconsisting of bliss may be considered as the primary Self, since it is stated\nto be the innermost of all, he replies that this cannot be admitted, because\nthe Self of bliss is declared to have joy and so on for its limbs, and because\nit is said to be embodied. If it were identical with the primary Self, joy and\nthe like would not touch it; but the text expressly says 'Joy is its head;'\nand about its being embodied we read, 'Of that former one this one is the\nembodied Self' (Taitt. Up. II, 6), i.e. of that former Self of Understanding\nthis Self of bliss is the embodied Self. And of what is embodied, the contact\nwith joy and pain cannot be prevented. Therefore the Self which consists of\nbliss is nothing but the transmigrating Soul.\n\nTo this reasoning we make the following reply:--By the Self consisting of\nbliss we have to understand the highest Self, 'on account of repetition.' For\nthe word 'bliss' is repeatedly applied to the highest Self. So Taitt. Up. II,\n7, where, after the clause 'That is flavour'--which refers back to the Self\nconsisting of bliss, and declares it to be of the nature of flavour--we read,\n'For only after having perceived flavour can any one perceive delight. Who\ncould breathe, who could breathe forth if that Bliss existed not in the ether\n(of the heart)? For he alone causes blessedness;' and again, II, 8, 'Now this\nis an examination of Bliss;' 'He reaches that Self consisting of Bliss;' and\nagain, II, 9, 'He who knows the Bliss of Brahman fears nothing;' and in\naddition, 'He understood that Bliss is Brahman' (III, 6). And in another\nscriptural passage also (B _ri_. Up. III, 9, 28), 'Knowledge and bliss is\nBrahman,' we see the word 'bliss' applied just to Brahman. As, therefore, the\nword 'bliss' is repeatedly used with reference to Brahman, we conclude that\nthe Self consisting of bliss is Brahman also. The objection that the Self\nconsisting of bliss can only denote\n\np. 66\n\nthe secondary Self (the Sa _m_ sarin), because it forms a link in a series of\nsecondary Selfs, beginning with the one consisting of food, is of no force,\nfor the reason that the Self consisting of bliss is the innermost of all. The\n_S_ astra, wishing to convey information about the primary Self, adapts itself\nto common notions, in so far as it at first refers to the body consisting of\nfood, which, although not the Self, is by very obtuse people identified with\nit; it then proceeds from the body to another Self, which has the same shape\nwith the preceding one, just as the statue possesses the form of the mould\ninto which the molten brass had been poured; then, again, to another one,\nalways at first representing the Non-Self as the Self, for the purpose of\neasier comprehension; and it finally teaches that the innermost Self 1, which\nconsists of bliss, is the real Self. Just as when a man, desirous of pointing\nout the star Arundhati to another man, at first points to several stars which\nare not Arundhati as being Arundhati, while only the star pointed out in the\nend is the real Arundhati; so here also the Self consisting of bliss is the\nreal Self on account of its being the innermost (i.e. the last). Nor can any\nweight be allowed to the objection that the attribution of joy and so on, as\nhead, &c., cannot possibly refer to the real Self; for this attribution is due\nto the immediately preceding limiting condition (viz. the Self consisting of\nunderstanding, the so-called vi _g \xc3\xb1_anakosa), and does not really belong to\nthe real Self. The possession of a bodily nature also is ascribed to the Self\nof bliss, only because it is represented as a link in the chain of bodies\nwhich begins with the Self consisting of food, and is not ascribed to it in\nthe same direct sense in which it is predicated of the transmigrating Self.\nHence the Self consisting of bliss is the highest Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[66:1](sbe34018.htm#fr_110) After which no other Self is mentioned.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 1, 13](sbe34019.htm)\n\n"
