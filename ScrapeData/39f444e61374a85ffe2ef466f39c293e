How great is the power of King\nDushyanta! Since his arrival our rites have been undisturbed.\n\nHe does not need to bend the bow;  \n  For every evil thing,  \nAwaiting not the arrow, flees  \n  From the twanging of the string.\n\n[paragraph continues] Well, I will take this sacred grass to the priests, to\nstrew the altar. ( _He walks and looks about, then speaks to some one not\nvisible_.) Priyamvada, for whom are you carrying this cuscus-salve and the\nfibrous lotus-leaves? ( _He listens_.) What do you say? That Shakuntala has\nbecome seriously ill from the heat, and that these things are to relieve her\nsuffering? Give her the best of care, Priyamvada. She is the very life of the\nhermit-father. And I will give Gautami the holy water for her. ( _Exit. Enter\nthe lovelorn king_.)\n\n_King_ ( _with a meditative sigh_ ).\n\nI know that stern religion\'s power  \n  Keeps guardian watch my maiden o\'er;  \nYet all my heart flows straight to her  \n  Like water to the valley-floor.\n\n[paragraph continues] Oh, mighty Love, thine arrows are made of flowers. How\ncan they be so sharp? ( _He recalls something_.) Ah, I understand.\n\nShiva\'s devouring wrath still burns in thee,  \nAs burns the eternal fire beneath the sea;  \n  Else how couldst thou, thyself long since consumed,  \nKindle the fire that flames so ruthlessly?\n\n[paragraph continues] Indeed, the moon and thou inspire confidence, only to\ndeceive the host of lovers.\n\np. 27\n\nThy shafts are blossoms; coolness streams  \n  From moon-rays: thus the poets sing;  \nBut to the lovelorn, falsehood seems  \n  To lurk in such imagining;  \nThe moon darts fire from frosty beams;  \n  Thy flowery arrows cut and sting.\n\n[paragraph continues] And yet\n\nIf Love will trouble her  \n  Whose great eyes madden me,  \nI greet him unafraid,  \n  Though wounded ceaselessly.\n\n[paragraph continues] O mighty god, wilt thou not show me mercy after such\nreproaches?\n\nWith tenderness unending  \n  I cherished thee when small,  \nIn vain--thy bow is bending;  \n  On me thine arrows fall.  \nMy care for thee to such a plight  \nHas brought me; and it serves me right.\n\n[paragraph continues] I have driven off the powers of evil, and the hermits\nhave dismissed me. Where shall I go now to rest from my weariness? ( _He\nsighs_.) There is no rest for me except in seeing her whom I love. ( _He looks\nup_.) She usually spends these hours of midday heat with her friends on the\nvine-wreathed banks of the Malini. I will go there. ( _He walks and looks\nabout_.) I believe the slender maiden has just passed through this corridor of\nyoung trees. For\n\nThe stems from which she gathered flowers  \n  Are still unhealed;  \nThe sap where twigs were broken off  \n  Is uncongealed.\n\n[paragraph continues] ( _He feels a breeze stirring_.) This is a pleasant\nspot, with the wind among the trees.\n\nLimbs that love\'s fever seizes,  \n  Their fervent welcome pay  \nTo lotus-fragrant breezes  \n  That bear the river-spray.\n\np. 28\n\n[paragraph continues] ( _He studies the ground_.) Ah, Shakuntala must be in\nthis reedy bower. For\n\nIn white sand at the door  \nFresh footprints appear,  \nThe toe lightly outlined,  \nThe heel deep and clear.\n\n[paragraph continues] I will hide among the branches, and see what happens. (\n_He does so. Joyfully_.) Ah, my eyes have found their heaven. Here is the\ndarling of my thoughts, lying upon a flower-strewn bench of stone, and\nattended by her two friends. I will hear what they say to each other. ( _He\nstands gazing. Enter_ SHAKUNTALA _with her two friends_.)\n\n_The two friends_ ( _fanning her_ ). Do you feel better, dear, when we fan you\nwith these lotus-leaves?\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _wearily_ ). Oh, are you fanning me, my dear girls? ( _The two\nfriends look sorrowfully at each other_.)\n\n_King_. She is seriously ill. ( _Doubtfully_.) Is it the heat, or is it as I\nhope? ( _Decidedly_.) It must be so.\n\nWith salve upon her breast,  \n  With loosened lotus-chain,  \nMy darling, sore oppressed,  \n  Is lovely in her pain.\n\nThough love and summer heat  \n  May work an equal woe,  \nNo maiden seems so sweet  \n  When summer lays her low.\n\n_Priyamvada_ ( _aside to_ ANUSUYA). Anusuya, since she first saw the good\nking, she has been greatly troubled. I do not believe her fever has any other\ncause.\n\n_Anusuya_. I suspect you are right. I am going to ask her. My dear, I must ask\nyou something. You are in a high fever.\n\n_King_. It is too true.\n\nHer lotus-chains that were as white  \nAs moonbeams shining in the night,  \nBetray the fever\'s awful pain,  \nAnd fading, show a darker stain.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _half rising_.) Well, say whatever you like.\n\np. 29\n\n_Anusuya_. Shakuntala dear, you have not told us what is going on in your\nmind. But I have heard old, romantic stories, and I can\'t help thinking that\nyou are in a state like that of a lady in love. Please tell us what hurts you.\nWe have to understand the disease before we can even try to cure it.\n\n_King_. Anusuya expresses my own thoughts.\n\n_Shakuntala_. It hurts me terribly. I can\'t tell you all at once.\n\n_Priyamvada_. Anusuya is right, dear. Why do you hide your trouble? You are\nwasting away every day. You are nothing but a beautiful shadow.\n\n_King_. Priyamvada is right. See!\n\nHer cheeks grow thin; her breast and shoulders fail;  \nHer waist is weary and her face is pale:  \nShe fades for love; oh, pitifully sweet!  \nAs vine-leaves wither in the scorching heat.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _sighing_ ). I could not tell any one else. But I shall be a\nburden to you. The two friends. That is why we insist on knowing, dear. Grief\nmust be shared to be endured.\n\n_King_.\n\nTo friends who share her joy and grief  \n  She tells what sorrow laid her here;  \nShe turned to look her love again  \n  When first I saw her--yet I fear!\n\n_Shakuntala_. Ever since I saw the good king who protects the pious grove (\n_She stops and fidgets_.)\n\n_The two friends_. Go on, dear.\n\n_Shakuntala_. I love him, and it makes me feel like this.\n\n_The two friends_. Good, good! You have found a lover worthy of your devotion.\nBut of course, a great river always runs into the sea.\n\n_King_ ( _joyfully_ ). I have heard what I longed to hear.\n\n\'Twas love that caused the burning pain;  \n\'Tis love that eases it again;  \nAs when, upon a sultry day,  \nRain breaks, and washes grief away.\n\n_Shakuntala_. Then, if you think best, make the good king take pity upon me.\nIf not, remember that I was.\n\np. 30\n\n_King_. Her words end all doubt.\n\n_Priyamvada_ ( _aside to_ ANUSUYA). Anusuya, she is far gone in love and\ncannot endure any delay.\n\n_Anusuya_. Priyamvada, can you think of any scheme by which we could carry out\nher wishes quickly and secretly? Priyamvada. We must plan about the\n"secretly." The "quickly" is not hard.\n\n_Anusuya_. How so?\n\n_Priyamvada_. Why, the good king shows his love for her in his tender glances,\nand he has been wasting away, as if he were losing sleep.\n\n_King_. It is quite true.\n\nThe hot tears, flowing down my cheek  \n  All night on my supporting arm  \nAnd on its golden bracelet, seek  \n  To stain the gems and do them harm,\n\nThe bracelet slipping o\'er the scars  \n  Upon the wasted arm, that show  \nMy deeds in hunting and in wars,  \n  All night is moving to and fro.\n\n_Priyamvada_ ( _reflecting_ ). Well, she must write him a love-letter. And I\nwill hide it in a bunch of flowers and see that it gets into the king\'s hand\nas if it were a relic of the sacrifice.\n\n_Anusuya_. It is a pretty plan, dear, and it pleases me. What does Shakuntala\nsay?\n\n_Shakuntala_. I suppose I must obey orders.\n\n_Priyamvada_. Then compose a pretty little love-song, with a hint of yourself\nin it.\n\n_Shakuntala_. I\'ll try. But my heart trembles, for fear he will despise me.\n\n_King_.\n\nHere stands the eager lover, and you pale  \nFor fear lest he disdain a love so kind:  \nThe seeker may find fortune, or may fail;  \nBut how could fortune, seeking, fail to find?\n\n[paragraph continues] And again:\n\nThe ardent lover comes, and yet you fear  \n  Lest he disdain love\'s tribute, were it brought, p. 31  \nThe hope of which has led his footsteps here--  \n  Pearls need not seek, for they themselves are sought.\n\n_The two friends_. You are too modest about your own charms. Would anybody put\nup a parasol to keep off the soothing autumn moonlight?\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _smiling_ ). I suppose I shall have to obey orders. ( _She\nmeditates_.)\n\n_King_. It is only natural that I should forget to wink when I see my darling.\nFor\n\nOne clinging eyebrow lifted,  \n  As fitting words she seeks,  \nHer face reveals her passion  \n  For me in glowing cheeks.\n\n_Shakuntala_. Well, I have thought out a little song. But I haven\'t anything\nto write with.\n\n_Priyamvada_. Here is a lotus-leaf, glossy as a parrot\'s breast. You can cut\nthe letters in it with your nails. Shakuntala. Now listen, and tell me whether\nit makes sense.\n\n_The two friends_. Please.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _reads_ ).\n\nI know not if I read your heart aright;  \n  Why, pitiless, do you distress me so?  \nI only know that longing day and night  \n  Tosses my restless body to and fro,  \n  That yearns for you, the source of all its woe.\n\n_King_ ( _advancing_ ).\n\nThough Love torments you, slender maid,  \n  Yet he consumes me quite,  \nAs daylight shuts night-blooming flowers  \n  And slays the moon outright.\n\n_The two friends_ ( _perceive the king and rise joyfully_ ). Welcome to the\nwish that is fulfilled without delay. (SHAKUNTALA _tries to rise_.)\n\n_King_. Do not try to rise, beautiful Shakuntala.\n\nYour limbs from which the strength is fled,  \nThat crush the blossoms of your bed  \nAnd bruise the lotus-leaves, may be  \nPardoned a breach of courtesy.\n\np. 32\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _sadly to herself_ ). Oh, my heart, you were so impatient, and\nnow you find no answer to make.\n\n_Anusuya_. Your Majesty, pray do this stone bench the honour of sitting upon\nit. (SHAKUNTALA _edges away_.)\n\n_King_ ( _seating himself_ ). Priyamvada, I trust your friend\'s illness is not\ndangerous.\n\n_Priyamvada_ ( _smiling_ ). A remedy is being applied and it will soon be\nbetter. It is plain, sir, that you and she love each other. But I love her\ntoo, and I must say something over again.\n\n_King_. Pray do not hesitate. It always causes pain in the end, to leave\nunsaid what one longs to say.\n\n_Priyamvada_. Then listen, sir.\n\n_King_. I am all attention.\n\n_Priyamvada_. It is the king\'s duty to save hermit-folk from all suffering. Is\nnot that good Scripture?\n\n_King_. There is no text more urgent.\n\n_Priyamvada_. Well, our friend has been brought to this sad state by her love\nfor you. Will you not take pity on her and save her life?\n\n_King_. We cherish the same desire. I feel it a great honour.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _with a jealous smile_ ). Oh, don\'t detain the good king. He is\nseparated from the court ladies, and he is anxious to go back to them.\n\n_King_.\n\nBewitching eyes that found my heart,  \n    You surely see  \nIt could no longer live apart,  \n    Nor faithless be.  \nI bear Love\'s arrows as I can;  \nWound not with doubt a wounded man.\n\n_Anusuya_. But, your Majesty, we hear that kings have many favourites. You\nmust act in such a way that our friend may not become a cause of grief to her\nfamily.\n\n_King_. What more can I say?\n\nThough many queens divide my court,  \n  But two support the throne;  \nYour friend will find a rival in  \n  The sea-girt earth alone.\n\n_The two friends_. We are content. (SHAKUNTALA _betrays her joy_.)\n\np. 33\n\n_Priyamvada_ ( _aside to_ ANUSUYA). Look, Anusuya! See how the dear girl\'s\nlife is coming back moment by moment--, just like a peahen in summer when the\nfirst rainy breezes come.\n\n_Shakuntala_. You must please ask the king\'s pardon for the rude things we\nsaid when we were talking together.\n\n_The two friends_ ( _smiling_ ). Anybody who says it was rude, may ask his\npardon. Nobody else feels guilty.\n\n_Shakuntala_. Your Majesty, pray forgive what we said when we did not know\nthat you were present. I am afraid that we say a great many things behind a\nperson\'s back.\n\n_King_ ( _smiling_ ).\n\nYour fault is pardoned if I may  \n  Relieve my weariness  \nBy sitting on the flower-strewn couch  \n  Your fevered members press.\n\n_Priyamvada_. But that will not be enough to satisfy him.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _feigning anger_ ). Stop! You are a rude girl. You make fun of\nme when I am in this condition.\n\n_Anusuya_ ( _looking out of the arbour_ ). Priyamvada, there is a little fawn,\nlooking all about him. He has probably lost his mother and is trying to find\nher. I am going to help him.\n\n_Priyamvada_. He is a frisky little fellow. You can\'t catch him alone. I\'ll go\nwith you. ( _They start to go_.)\n\n_Shakuntala_. I will not let you go and leave me alone.\n\n_The two friends_ ( _smiling_ ). You alone, when the king of the world is with\nyou! ( _Exeunt_.)\n\n_Shakuntala_. Are my friends gone?\n\n_King_ ( _looking about_ ). Do not be anxious, beautiful Shakuntala. Have you\nnot a humble servant here, to take the place of your friends? Then tell me:\n\nShall I employ the moistened lotus-leaf  \nTo fan away your weariness and grief?  \nOr take your lily feet upon my knee  \nAnd rub them till you rest more easily?\n\n_Shakuntala_. I will not offend against those to whom I owe honour. ( _She\nrises weakly and starts to walk away_.)\n\np. 34\n\n_King_ ( _detaining her_ ). The day is still hot, beautiful Shakuntala, and\nyou are feverish.\n\nLeave not the blossom-dotted couch  \n  To wander in the midday heat,  \nWith lotus-petals on your breast,  \n  With fevered limbs and stumbling feet.\n\n( _He lays his hand upon her_.)\n\n_Shakuntala_. Oh, don\'t! Don\'t! For I am not mistress of myself. Yet what can\nI do now? I had no one to help me but my friends.\n\n_King_. I am rebuked.\n\n_Shakuntala_. I was not thinking of your Majesty. I was accusing fate.\n\n_King_. Why accuse a fate that brings what you desire?\n\n_Shakuntala_. Why not accuse a fate that robs me of self-control and tempts me\nwith the virtues of another?\n\n_King_ ( _to himself_ ).\n\nThough deeply longing, maids are coy  \n  And bid their wooers wait;  \nThough eager for united joy  \n  In love, they hesitate.\n\nLove cannot torture them, nor move  \n  Their hearts to sudden mating;  \nPerhaps they even torture love  \n  By their procrastinating.\n\n(SHAKUNTALA _moves away_.)\n\n_King_. Why should I not have my way? ( _He approaches and seizes her dress_.)\n\n_Shakuntala_. Oh, sir! Be a gentleman. There are hermits wandering about.\n\n_King_. Do not fear your family, beautiful Shakuntala. Father Kanva knows the\nholy law. He will not regret it.\n\nFor many a hermit maiden who  \n  By simple, voluntary rite  \nDispensed with priest and witness, yet  \n  Found favour in her father\'s sight.\n\n[paragraph continues] ( _He looks about_.) Ah, I have come into the open air.\n( _He leaves_ SHAKUNTALA _and retraces his steps_.)\n\np. 35\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _takes a step, then turns with an eager gesture_ ). O King, I\ncannot do as you would have me. You hardly know me after this short talk. But\noh, do not forget me.\n\n_King_.\n\nWhen evening comes, the shadow of the tree  \n  Is cast far forward, yet does not depart;  \nEven so, beloved, wheresoe\'er you be,  \n  The thought of you can never leave my heart.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _takes a few steps. To herself_ ). Oh, oh! When I hear him\nspeak so, my feet will not move away. I will hide in this amaranth hedge and\nsee how long his love lasts; ( _She hides and waits_.)\n\n_King_. Oh, my beloved, my love for you is my whole life, yet you leave me and\ngo away without a thought.\n\nYour body, soft as siris-flowers,  \nEngages passion\'s utmost powers;  \nHow comes it that your heart is hard  \nAs stalks that siris-blossoms guard?\n\n_Shakuntala_. When I hear this, I have no power to go.\n\n_King_. What have I to do here, where she is not? ( _He gazes on the ground_.)\nAh, I cannot go.\n\nThe perfumed lotus-chain  \n  That once was worn by her  \nFetters and keeps my heart  \n  A hopeless prisoner. ( _He lifts it reverently_.)\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _looking at her arm_ ). Why, I was so weak and ill that when\nthe lotus-bracelet fell off, I did not even notice it.\n\n_King_ ( _laying the lotus-bracelet on his heart_ ). Ah!\n\nOnce, dear, on your sweet arm it lay,  \nAnd on my heart shall ever stay;  \nThough you disdain to give me joy,  \nI find it in a lifeless toy.\n\n_Shakuntala_. I cannot hold back after that. I will use the bracelet as an\nexcuse for my coming. ( _She approaches_.)\n\n_King_ ( _seeing her. Joyfully_ ). The queen of my life! As soon as I\ncomplained, fate proved kind to me.\n\np. 36\n\nNo sooner did the thirsty bird  \n  With parching throat complain,  \nThan forming clouds in heaven stirred  \n  And sent the streaming rain.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _standing before the king_ ). When I was going away, sir, I\nremembered that this lotus-bracelet had fallen from my arm, and I have come\nback for it My heart seemed to tell me that you had taken it. Please give it\nback, or you will betray me, and yourself too, to the hermits.\n\n_King_. I will restore it on one condition.\n\n_Shakuntala_. What condition?\n\n_King_. That I may myself place it where it belongs.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _to herself_ ). What can I do? ( _She approaches_.)\n\n_King_. Let us sit on this stone bench. ( _They walk to the bench and sit\ndown_.)\n\n_King_ ( _taking_ SHAKUNTALA\'S _hand_ ). Ah!\n\nWhen Shiva\'s anger burned the tree  \n  Of love in quenchless fire,  \nDid heavenly fate preserve a shoot  \n  To deck my heart\'s desire?\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _feeling his touch_ ). Hasten, my dear, hasten.\n\n_King_ ( _joyfully to himself_ ). Now I am content. She speaks as a wife to\nher husband. ( _Aloud_.) Beautiful Shakuntala, the clasp of the bracelet is\nnot very firm. May I fasten it in another way?\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _smiling_ ). If you like.\n\n_King_ ( _artfully delaying before he fastens it_ ). See, my beautiful girl!\n\nThe lotus-chain is dazzling white  \nAs is the slender moon at night.  \nPerhaps it was the moon on high  \nThat joined her horns and left the sky,  \nBelieving that your lovely arm  \nWould, more than heaven, enhance her charm.\n\n_Shakuntala_. I cannot see it. The pollen from the lotus over my ear has blown\ninto my eye.\n\n_King_ ( _smiling_ ). Will you permit me to blow it away?\n\n_Shakuntala_. I should not like to be an object of pity. But why should I not\ntrust you?\n\np. 37\n\n_King_. Do not have such thoughts. A new servant does not transgress orders.\n\n_Shakuntala_. It is this exaggerated courtesy that frightens me.\n\n_King_ ( _to himself_ ). I shall not break the bonds of this sweet servitude.\n( _He starts to raise her face to his_. SHAKUNTALA _resists a little, then is\npassive_.)\n\n_King_. Oh, my bewitching girl, have no fear of me. (SHAKUNTALA _darts a\nglance at him, then looks down. The king raises her face. Aside_.)\n\nHer sweetly trembling lip  \n  With virgin invitation  \nProvokes my soul to sip  \n  Delighted fascination.\n\n_Shakuntala_. You seem slow, dear, in fulfilling your promise.\n\n_King_. The lotus over your ear is so near your eye, and so like it, that I\nwas confused. ( _He gently blows her eye_.)\n\n_Shakuntala_. Thank you. I can see quite well now. But I am ashamed not to\nmake any return for your kindness.\n\n_King_. What more could I ask?\n\nIt ought to be enough for me  \n  To hover round your fragrant face;  \nIs not the lotus-haunting bee  \n  Content with perfume and with grace?\n\n_Shakuntala_. But what does he do if he is not content?\n\n_King_. This! This! ( _He draws her face to his_.)\n\n_A voice behind the scenes_. O sheldrake bride, bid your mate farewell. The\nnight is come.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _listening excitedly_ ). Oh, my dear, this is Mother Gautami,\ncome to inquire about me. Please hide among the branches. ( _The king conceals\nhimself. Enter_ GAUTAMI, _with a bowl in her hand_.)\n\n_Gautami_. Here is the holy water, my child. (She sees SHAKUNTALA and helps\nher to rise.) So ill, and all alone here with the gods?\n\n_Shakuntala_. It was just a moment ago that Priyamvada. and Anusuya went down\nto the river.\n\n_Gautami_ ( _sprinkling_ SHAKUNTALA _with the holy water_ ). May\n\np. 38\n\nyou live long and happy, my child. Has the fever gone down? ( _She touches\nher_.)\n\n_Shakuntala_. There is a difference, mother.\n\n_Gautami_. The sun is setting. Come, let us go to the cottage.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _weakly rising. To herself_ ). Oh, my heart, you delayed when\nyour desire came of itself. Now see what you have done. ( _She takes a step,\nthen turns around. Aloud_.) O bower that took away my pain, I bid you farewell\nuntil another blissful hour. ( _Exeunt_ SHAKUNTALA _and_ GAUTAMI.)\n\n_King_ ( _advancing with a sigh_.) The path to happiness is strewn with\nobstacles.\n\nHer face, adorned with soft eye-lashes,  \nAdorable with trembling flashes  \nOf half-denial, in memory lingers;  \nThe sweet lips guarded by her fingers,  \nThe head that drooped upon her shoulder--  \nWhy was I not a little bolder?\n\n[paragraph continues] Where shall I go now? Let me stay a moment in this bower\nwhere my beloved lay. ( _He looks about_.)\n\nThe flower-strewn bed whereon her body tossed;  \nThe bracelet, fallen from her arm and lost;  \nThe dear love-missive, in the lotus-leaf  \nCut by her nails: assuage my absent grief  \nAnd occupy my eyes--I have no power,  \nThough she is gone, to leave the reedy bower.\n\n[paragraph continues] ( _He reflects_.) Alas! I did wrong to delay when I had\nfound my love. So now\n\nIf she will grant me but one other meeting,  \nI\'ll not delay; for happiness is fleeting;  \nSo plans my foolish, self-defeated heart;  \nBut when she comes, I play the coward\'s part.\n\n_A voice behind the scenes_. O King!\n\nThe flames rise heavenward from the evening altar;  \n  And round the sacrifices, blazing high,  \nFlesh-eating demons stalk, like red cloud-masses,  \n  And cast colossal shadows on the sky.\n\n_King_ ( _listens. Resolutely_ ), Have no fear, hermits. I am here.\n\n( _Exit_.)\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Act IV. Shakuntala\'s Departure](sha08.htm)\n\n'
