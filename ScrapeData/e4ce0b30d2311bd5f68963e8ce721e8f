A reference (only) _G_ aimini (holds them to be), on account of absence\nof injunction; for (Scripture) forbids.\n\nThe argument for the three stages of life, founded on their mention in Vedic\ntexts, has no force, since all those references are only of the nature of\nanuvada. For none of those texts contain injunctive forms. The text 'There are\nthree branches of sacred observance,' &c. ( _Kh_. Up. II, 23, 1), is meant to\nglorify the previous meditation on Brahman under the form of the pra\xc2\xabava, as\nappears from the concluding clause 'he who is firmly grounded in Brahman\nobtains immortality'; it therefore cannot mean to enjoin the three conditions\nof life as valid states. In the same way the text 'And those who in the forest\npractise penance and faith' refers to the statements previously made as to the\npath of the gods, and cannot therefore be meant to make an original\ndeclaration as to another condition of life. Scripture moreover expressly\nforbids that other condition, 'a murderer of men is he who removes the fire,'\n&c. There are therefore no conditions of life in which men are bound to\nobserve chastity. This is the opinion of the teacher _G_ aimini.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 19. It is to be accomplished, ... on account of scriptural statement of\nequality](sbe48466.htm)\n\n"
