Raja Nurug, of the family of Ishwak,\nwas very intelligent, liberal, religious and brave; he made innumerable\npresents of cows; it would be as easy to count the grains of sand of the\nGanges, the drops of rain in the month of Bhador, and the stars of the sky, as\nto reckon the number of cows Raja Narug gave away; although he was so wise and\nso very liberal a Raja, he was, for a slight transgression, changed into a\nlizard, and dwelt in a dry well, and Shree Krishnu Chund Jee released him.\n\nIn this part of the history, the Raja Pureechit interrupted Spree Shookdeo\nJee, and enquired,--"O great king! for what sin was so pious and liberal a\nRaja turned into a lizard, and why did he remain in a dry well, and how did\nShree Krishnu Chund Jee release him? Explain these circumstances to me, that\nthe perplexities of my mind may be removed?" Shree Shookdeo replied,--O great\nking! be pleased to listen with attention, and I will explain all the\ncircumstances as they occurred. The Raja Nurug was in the constant habit of\npresenting gifts of cows; one day, having bathed early in the morning, and\nfinished his religious meditations and prayers, he gave in alms a thousand\ncows; white, purple, black, yellow, brown and grey, with hoofs of silver,\nhorns of gold, backs of\n\np. 325\n\ncopper, and dressed out in cloths of silk; and in addition to the cows, he\ngave as a present to brahmins large quantities of grain, and a great deal of\nmoney, all of which they took to their homes; on another day the Raja, in like\nmanner, began to make a present of cows; when, unknown to the Raja, a cow that\nhad been given away on the first day, was mixed up with the cows of the second\nday, which the Raja gave away with that day\'s cows; a brahmin, who received\nit, was taking it to. his house, when another brahmin, recognizing the cow as\nhis, stopped it on the road and said, "This is my cow, I received it yesterday\nat the Raja\'s, brother! why are you taking it away?" The brahmin replied, "I\nhave just received this cow from the Raja, and am bringing it thence, how is\nit yours?" O great king! the two brahmins began thus to dispute, each claiming\nthe cow; after disputing some time they both went to the Raja, who, having\nheard the statements of both, joining his hands, said, in a very submissive\nmanner, "Let one receive from me a lakh of rupees, and let the other take the\ncow, or let me give the cow to the other." Both the quarrelsome brahmins were\nvery angry at this proposal, and said, "The cow, for which, on receiving, we\npronounced a benediction, we will not give up for a crore of rupees, this is a\npart of our souls." O great king! the Raja then falling at the feet of those\nbrahmins, tried every means of coaxing and explanation, but those vindictive\nbrahmins would not listen to what the Raja said; at length, both the brahmins\nwent away very angry to their homes, leaving the cow, and saying to the Raja,\n"O great king! the cow, which you gave in alms to us, and which we received,\nafter having extended our hands to pronounce a benediction, is not to be given\nup for money, if it still remain with you, without our receiving any thing, it\ndoes not signify, (or, we have no objection.)"\n\nO great king! on the departure of the brahmins, the Raja Nurug was at first\nvery sad, and began to say to himself, "I\n\np. 326\n\nhave unintentionally committed this act of injustice, and how will it be wiped\naway;" and after this he continued to perform many acts of charity, and gave\nmany gifts. After the lapse of many days, the Raja Nurug died, the attendants\nof Jum took him to Dhurumraj, who, on seeing him, rising from his throne,\nstood up; having afterwards welcomed him, and offered him a seat, he said in\nthe kindest manner, "O great king! your virtues are many, and sins few; what\nwill you first receive, the reward of virtue, or the punishment of crime?" On\nhearing this Nurug said, joining his hands, "Do not, O lord! let my good acts\npass away from your mind, I will first suffer for my sins, and endure\naffliction in mortal shape." On hearing these words, Dhurumraj said to the\nRaja Nurug "O great king! for the sin of having unknowingly given away a cow a\nsecond time, which you had already once given, you must become a lizard in a\nforest on the banks of the Goomtee, and remain in a dry well; when Shree\nKrishnu Chund shall descend upon the earth at the end of the Dwarpur age, he\nwill grant you release."\n\nO great king! having thus spoken, Dhurumraj remained silent, and the Raja\nNurug, being then transformed into a lizard, went and fell into a dry well;\nand feeding on animals, began to abide there; after the lapse of some ages,\nShree Krishnu Chund Jee descended upon the earth at the end of the Dwarpur\nage; when, having enjoyed sports and diversions at Bruj, he went to Dwarka,\nand had sons and grandsons. A number of his sons and grandsons went together\none day to the forest to hunt; and, whilst engaged in hunting, became thirsty;\nby chance, as they were searching for water in the forest, they came to the\nbrink of the blind well, in which Raja Nurug, having been born as a lizard,\ndwelt. As one of them leaned over the well to look into it, he called out to\nthe rest, "Brothers! come and see what a large lizard there is in this well!"\nthey all ran to the spot on hearing this, and standing on the raised stone\nmasonry round the mouth of the well, began to\n\np. 327\n\nfasten their turbands and waistbands together, and suspending them in the air,\ntried to draw him forth, and to say to each other, "Brother! we will not go\naway from this place until we have drawn the lizard out of the well."\n\nO great king! when all their efforts with their turbands and waistbands did\nnot succeed, they procured from the village flax, thread and grass, with which\nropes are made, and thick, large thongs of leather; and letting them down the\nwell, and fastening the lizard with them, began to pull forcibly, but the\nlizard was not even moved thence; then some one went to Dwarka, and said to\nShree Krishnu Jee, "O great king! there is an enormous lizard inside a dry\nwell in the forest, which all the children have fatigued themselves in trying\nto pull out, but it will not come forth."\n\nOn hearing these words, Huri rose and started off; and going along came to the\nplace were all the children were trying to pull the lizard out. On seeing\nKrishnu the children said, "Father! see what a large lizard this is; we have\nfor a long time been trying to pull it out, but it will not come."\n\nO great king! having heard this speech, when Shree Krishnu Chund Jee descended\ninto the well, and placed his foot on the lizard\'s body, he relinquished his\nform, and became a very handsome man. In the form of a Raja, he continued to\nlay hold of Krishnu\'s feet, joining his hands, and bowing his head, he\nsolicited him, "O sea of compassion! you have shown me great favour in having\ntaken thought of me in the midst of this great calamity."\n\nShookdeo Jee said,--Raja! when in the form of a man, he began to address Huri\nthus, the Judoos\' children, and the sons and grandsons of Huri being\nastonished, enquired from Shree Krishnu Chund, "O great king! who is this, and\nfor what crime, being transformed into a lizard, has he remained here, kindly\ntell us, in order that the perplexities of our minds may be removed." Then\nKrishnu, without making any reply himself, said to the Raja, "Explain your\nhistory, so that all may\n\np. 328\n\nhear it with attention. Who are you; whence have you come, and for what sin\nhave you obtained this body?" The Raja replied, joining his hands, "You know\nit all, O lord of the Judoos! But as you ask me to relate my history, I will\ndo so? My name is Raja Nurug, I gave numberless cows to brahmins for your\nsake; it so happened that one day I gave a great many cows in alms to\nbrahmins, on another day one of those cows came back to me; which, without\nbeing aware of this circumstance, I gave away with other cows to another\nbrahmin; as he took the cow away with him, the first brahmin recognizing it as\nhis, said to him, \'This cow is mine, I yesterday received it at the Raja\'s,\nwhy are you taking it away?\' He replied, \'I have just received it at the\nRaja\'s, and am bringing it thence, how is it yours?\' O great king! those two\nbrahmins came to me, disputing on this matter; I explained to them and said,\n\'One of you receive from me a lakh of rupees in compensation for the cow, and\none of you give up your claim to the cow.\' O great king! they both obstinately\nrefused to listen to what I said; at length they both went away angry, leaving\nthe cow with me; I continued to regret, and to be distressed at the\ncircumstance. At the time of my decease, the messenger of Jum took me to\nDhurumraj, who said to me, \'Raja! your virtues are many, and your sins few;\nsay, will you first receive the reward of your virtues, or suffer for your\ncrimes?\' I replied, \'I will suffer first for my sins.\' On hearing this, O\ngreat king! Dhurumraj said, \'Raja! thou hast bestowed upon a brahmin a cow,\nwhich thou hadst already given away; for this fault be transformed into a\nlizard, and go upon the earth, and remain in a dry well in a forest, on the\nbanks of the Goomtee; when, at the end of the Dwarpur age, Shree Krishnu Chund\nhaving descended upon the earth, shall go to you, you will then be released.\'\nO great king! from that time I have been lying in this blind well, in the form\nof a lizard, and have meditated upon your\n\np. 329\n\nlotus feet; you have now come and delivered me from a great affliction, and\ncarried me across the ocean of existence."\n\nHaving proceeded thus far in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the\nRaja Pureechit,--O great king! the Raja Nurug having thus spoken, took leave;\nand, sitting in a chariot went to Vishnu\'s paradise; and Shree Krishnu Chund\nJee explained to all the cowherds\' children, and began to say, "Do not any of\nyou commit a crime against a brahmin, nor seize on a brahmin\'s portion;\nwhatever you may have vowed in your minds to offer, keep back no portion of\nit; speak the truth to brahmins. Jum has inflicted this punishment on one, who\nreceived back, what had been given to a brahmin; continue to be the servants\nof brahmins, submit to all the transgressions of brahmins; whoever respects a\nbrahmin respects me, let not any one think a brahmin and me separate front\neach other, he, who shall suppose that there is a difference between me and a\nbrahmin, shall fall into hell; and he who shall treat with consideration and\nhonour a brahmin, shall obtain my favour; and shall, without doubt, go to\nheaven."\n\nO great king! having thus spoken, Shree Krishnu Jee took them all thence, and\nreturned to the city of Dwarka.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LXVI](psa67.htm)\n\n'
