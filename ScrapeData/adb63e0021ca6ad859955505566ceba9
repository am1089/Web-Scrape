This is that Agni with whom the desiring Indra took the pressed Soma into\nhis body. Having obtained thousandfold strength like a horse, a racer\n[1](sbe46082.htm#an_3:22:1:1), thou art praised, O _G_ atavedas!\n\n2 [1](sbe46082.htm#an_3:22:2:1). Thy splendour, O Agni, which dwells in heaven\nand on earth, in the plants, O worshipful one, and in the waters, wherewith\nthou hast spread through the wide air--that light of thine is fierce, waving\n[2](sbe46082.htm#an_3:22:2:2), man-beholding.\n\n3\\. Agni, thou goest to the floods of heaven. Thou hast spoken to the gods who\nare liberal (?) [1](sbe46082.htm#an_3:22:3:1). (Thou goest) to the waters\nwhich (dwell) on high in the ether of the sun, and to those which approach\nbelow.\n\n4\\. May the fires of the soil united with those on the hill-sides\n[1](sbe46082.htm#an_3:22:4:1), without guile graciously accept our sacrifice\nand plentiful food free from all plague.\n\n5 = III, 1, 23.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi. The metre is Trish _t_ ubh, except in verse 4 which is\nAnush _t_ ubh.--A conjecture on the ritual use for which the hymn has been\ncomposed, see in the note on verse 4.--Verses 1-5 = VS. XII, 47-51; TS. IV, 2,\n4, 2. 3; MS. II, 7, 11.--A sort of commentary on this hymn is found in the _S_\natapatha Brahma _n_ a VII, 1, 1, 22 seq.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. In the traditional text the words, 'a horse, a racer,' are\naccusatives. But it is the atya who attains\n\np. 286\n\n[paragraph continues] (san) the va\xc2\xb4 _g_ a and who is called va _g_ in (comp.\nM. M., vol. xxxii, pp. 116, 442, and on sapti, ibid. p. 102): see I, 130, 6;\nIII, 2, 7; 38, 1 (V, 30, 14; IX, 93, 1; 96, 15, &c.); VII, 24, 5; IX, 43, 5;\n82, 2; 85, 5; 86, 3; 96, 20; X, 96, 10 (I, 52, 1, and III, 2, 3 do not\ncontradict this). Pischel (Vedische Studien, I, 105) believes that atyam na\nstands for atya _h_ na, which seems impossible to me. But I think that we\nshould correct the text and read atya _h_ na sapti _h_. The preceding\naccusatives have caused the blunder.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Comp. Grassmann, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XVI, 165.\n\nNote 2. Comp. ketu _h_ ar _n_ ava _h_ su\xc2\xb4ryasya, VII, 63, 2.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. In the translation of dhish _n_ ya I have followed Pischel, Vedische\nStudien, II, 87, though this translation is quite uncertain. Should the\nmeaning be: 'the gods who dwell on the dhish _n_ ya altars'?\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Agni purishya, i. e. the fire dwelling in the soil (comp. Roth in\nKuhn's Zeitschrift, XXVI, 64), is mentioned very frequently in the Mantras\nbelonging to the Agni _k_ ayana, i. e. to the construction of the brick altar.\nAgni is considered as residing in the soil used at that rite. Now in the Ya\n_g_ us texts the whole of our hymn occurs among the texts to be recited at the\nAgni _k_ ayana (Taitt. Sa _m_ h. IV, 2, 4, 2, &c.; comp. also \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana\n_S_ rautasutra IV, 8, 20). Perhaps we may conjecture, therefore, that the Agni\n_k_ ayana rite in its simplest form was known already in the Rig-veda period,\nand that our hymn was destined for it.--The prava _n_ a fires (fires dwelling\non the hill-sides) may be the fires dwelling in the rivers which run down the\nprava _n_ as or descents.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 23](sbe46083.htm)\n\n"
