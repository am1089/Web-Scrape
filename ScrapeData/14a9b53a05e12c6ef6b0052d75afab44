The Ri _s_ is said :-- \xc2\x93O Suta! You told before, that Vyasa Deva,\nunrivalled spirit, composed all the Pura _n_ as and taught them to his own\nS\xc2\x92uka Deva; but how did Vyasadeva, who was incessantly engaged in tapasya,\n\n\n\np. 34\n\n\n\nprocreate S\xc2\x92uka? Describe to us in detail what you heard direct from Kri _sn_\na Dvaipayana Vyasa\xc2\x94. Suta said :-- \xc2\x93O Ri _s_ is! Hear how S\xc2\x92uka Deva, the best\nof the Munis and the foremost of the Yogis, was born of Vyasa Deva, the\nSatyavati's son.\n\n\n\nOn the very beautiful summit of Mount Meru, Vyasa, the son of Satyavati,\nfirmly determined, practised very severe austerities for the attainment of a\nson. Having heard from Narada, he, the great ascetic, repeated the one\nsyllabled mantra of Vak and worshipped the Highest Mahamaya with the object of\ngetting a son. He asked, Let a son be born to me as pure and as spirited and\npowerful as fire, air, earth, and \xc3\x82kas\xc2\x92a. He thought over in his mind that the\nman possessed of S\xc2\x92akti is worshipped in this world and the man devoid of\nS\xc2\x92akti is censured here, and thus came to the conclusion that S\xc2\x92akti is\ntherefore worshipped every where; and, therefore,worshipped Bhagavan\nMahes'vara coupled with the auspicious \xc3\x82dya S\xc2\x92akti and spent away one hundred\nyears without any food. He began his tapasya on that mountain summit which was\nornamented with the garden of Karnikar, where all the Devas play, and where\nlive the Munis highly ascetic, the \xc3\x82dityas, Vasus, Rudras, Marut, the two\nAs'vins, and the other mindful Ri _s_ is, the knowers of Brahma and where the\nKinnaras always resound the air with their songs of music, etc.; such a place\nVyasa Deva preferred for his tapasya.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nThe whole universe was pervaded with the spirit of asceticism of the\nintelligent Parasara's son Vyasa Deva; and the hairs of his head were clotted\nand looked tawny, of the colour of flames. Seeing the fire of his asceticism,\nIndra, the lord of S\xc2\x92achi became exceedingly terrified. Bhagavan Rudra, seeing\nIndra thus afraid, fatigued and morose, asked him :-- \xc2\x93O Indra, why do you\nlook so fear-stricken to-day? O Lord of the Devas! What is the cause of your\ngrief? Never show your jealousy and anger to the ascetics; for the mindful\nascetics always practise severe asceticism with a noble object and worship Me,\nknowing Me to be possessed of the all powerful S\xc2\x92akti; they never want ill of\nany body\xc2\x94. When Bhagavan Rudra said this, Indra asked him :-- \xc2\x93What is his\nobject?\xc2\x94 At this S\xc2\x92ankara said :-- For the attainment of a son, Prasara's son\nis practising so severe austerities; now one-hundred years is being completed;\nI will go to him, and give him to-day the auspicious boon of a son. Thus\nspeaking to Indra, Bhagavan Rudra, the Guru of the world, went to Vyasa Deva\nand, with merciful eyes, said :-- \xc2\x93O sinless Vasavi's son! Get up; I grant to\nyou the boon, that you will get a son very fiery, luminous and spirited like\nthe five elements fire, air, earth, water and \xc3\x82kas'a, the supreme J\xc3\xb1ani, the\nstore of all auspicious qualities, of great renown, beloved to all, ornamented\nwith all Sattvik qualities, truthful and valorous.\n\n\n\np. 35\n\n\n\nHearing these sweet words of Bhagavan S\xc2\x92ulapa _n_ i Mahar _s_ i Kri _sn_ a\nDvaipayana bowed down to Him and went back to his own hermitage. Tired with\nthe labour of penance for many years, he wanted to kindle fire by rubbing two\nfuels (Ara _n i_) with each other. While doing this the high souled man\nsuddenly began to think strongly in his mind about procreating a son. He\nthought :-- \xc2\x93Will it be that my son will be born as this fire is produced by\nthe friction of the two churning sticks? I have not got the wife, which the\nPundits designate a \xc2\x93Putrarani\xc2\x94, the youthful wife endowed with beauty, born\nof a noble family, the chaste one I have not got with me. But the wife, though\nchaste and fit to beget a son, is undoubtedly a chain to both the legs so how\ncan I get such a one for my wife? This is known to all that a chaste wife,\nthough clever in doing all household duties, beautiful and giving happiness to\none's desires, is yet always a sort of bondage. What more than this, that the\never Bhagavan Mahes'vara is always under the bondage of woman. How, then,\nknowing and hearing all these I can accept this difficult householder's life?\nWhile he was thinking thus, the extraordinarily beautiful Apsara Ghritachi\nfell to his sight close to him in the celestial air.\n\n\n\nThough Vyasa Deva was a Brahmachari (holding in control the secret power of\ngeneration) of a very high order, yet seeing suddenly the agile Apsara (a\ncelestial nymph) coming close to him and looking askance at him, he became\nsoon smitten with the arrows of cupid and feeling himself distressed, began to\nthink what shall I do in this critical moment.\n\n\n\nUnbearable amorous feelings now have come over me; now if I take this\ncelestial nymph, knowing that Dharma is everywhere looking, and woman has come\nto take away my precious fire of spirit acquired by my tapasya, then I will be\nlaughed at by the high souled ascetic Munis who will think that I have lost my\nsenses altogether. Alas! Why I who have practised for one hundred years the\nmost terrible ascetism, have become so powerless by the mere sight of this\nApsara! The Pundits declare the household life as the source of getting son,\none's heart\xc2\x92s desire and the source of all happiness; so much so that it leads\nall the virtuous souls to the pleasures of Heaven, and ordains Mok _s_ a\n(liberation) to those who are J\xc3\xb1anins; and if I get such unrivalled happiness\nfrom this householder's life, I can have this Deva Kanya (the celestial nymph)\nthough blameable. But again that happiness will not occur to me through her;\nthere is no doubt in this. So how can I take her. I heard from Narada how, in\nancient days, a king name Pururava fell under the clutches of Urvas'i and\nultimately felt great pain, being defeated by her.\n\n\n\nThus ends the tenth chapter on S\xc2\x92iva's granting boon in the Mahapura _n_ a\nS\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyas.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 11](bk01ch11.htm)\n\n"
