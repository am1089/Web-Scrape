Should it be said that (sacrificial work is) unholy; we deny this on the\nground of scripture.\n\nWe proceed to refute the remark made by the purvapakshin that sacrificial\nworks are unholy because involving harm done to animals, &c., that they may\ntherefore lead to unpleasant results, and that hence the statement as to the\nsouls being born as plants, &c., may be taken in its\n\np. 131\n\nliteral sense; in consequence of which it would be uncalled-for to assume a\nderived sense.--This reasoning is not valid, because our knowledge of what is\nduty and the contrary of duty depends entirely on scripture. The knowledge of\none action being right and another wrong is based on scripture only; for it\nlies out of the cognizance of the senses, and there moreover is, in the case\nof right and wrong, an entire want of binding rules as to place, time, and\noccasion. What in one place, at one time, on one occasion is performed as a\nright action, is a wrong action in another place, at another time, on another\noccasion; none therefore can know, without scripture, what is either right or\nwrong. Now from scripture we derive the certain knowledge that the _g_ yotish\n_t_ oma-sacrifice, which involves harm done to animals (i.e. the animal\nsacrifice), &c., is an act of duty; how then can it be called unholy?--But\ndoes not the scriptural precept, 'Do not harm any creature,' intimate that to\ndo harm to any being is an act contrary to duty?--True, but that is a general\nrule, while the precept, 'Let him offer an animal to Agnishomau,' embodies an\nexception; and general rule and exception have different spheres of\napplication. The work (i.e. sacrifice) enjoined by the Veda is therefore holy,\nbeing performed by authoritative men and considered blameless; and to be born\nas a plant cannot be its fruit. Nor can to be born as rice and other plants be\nconsidered analogous to being born as dogs, &c. For the latter birth scripture\nteaches with reference to men of evil conduct only; while no such specific\nqualification is stated in the case of vegetable existence. Hence we conclude\nthat when scripture states that the souls descending from the moon become\nplants, it only means that they become enclosed in plants.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 1, 26](sbe38102.htm)\n\n"
