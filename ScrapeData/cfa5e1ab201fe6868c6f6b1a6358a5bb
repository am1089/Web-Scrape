Or else in the manner stated above.\n\nThe _but_ sets aside the two preceding alternatives. One substance may indeed\nconnect itself with several states, but the former of the two alternatives\nimplies that Brahman itself constitutes the essential nature of non-sentient\nmatter, and thus there is no escape from the objections already stated under\nSutra 27. Let then the second alternative be adopted according to which\nBrahma-hood (brahmatva) constitutes a genus inhering in Brahman as well as in\nnon-sentient matter, just as fire constitutes the common genus for light and\nluminous bodies. But on this view Brahman becomes a mere abstract generic\ncharacter inhering in the Lord (isvara), sentient souls and non-sentient\nmatter, just as the generic character of horses (a _s_ vatva) inheres in\nconcrete individual horses; and this contradicts all the teaching of _S_ ruti\nand Sm _ri_ ti (according to which Brahman is the highest concrete entity). We\ntherefore hold that non-sentient matter stands to Brahman in the same relation\nas the one previously proved for the individual soul in Sutra II, 3, 43; 46;\nviz. that it is an attribute incapable of being realised apart from Brahman\nand hence is a part (a _ms_ a) of the latter. The texts referring to the two\nas non-different may thus be taken in their primary sense; for the part is\nonly a limited place of that of which it is a part. And the texts referring to\nthe two as different may also be taken in their primary sense; for the\ndistinguishing attribute and that to which the attribute belongs are\nessentially different. Thus Brahman's freedom from all imperfection is\npreserved.--Lustre is an attribute not to be realised apart from the gem, and\ntherefore is a part of the gem; the same relation also holds good between\ngeneric character and individuals having that character, between qualities and\nthings having qualities, between bodies and souls. In the same way souls as\nwell as non-sentient matter stand to Brahman in the relation of parts.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 29. And on account of denial](sbe48373.htm)\n\n"
