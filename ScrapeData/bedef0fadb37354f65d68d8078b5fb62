Vyasa said :-- The King Mahi _s_ asura, maddened with pride, heard the\nmessenger\xc2\x92s words and called the aged and experienced ministers and said thus\n:-- O Ministers! What am I to do now? Better judge you all well, and speak out\ndefinitely to me. Is it that this Devi has been created by the Devas like the\nMaya of Sambarasura and thus has appeared before us? You are all dexterous and\nknow where to apply the four means of success, viz., conciliation, gift or\nbribery, sowing dissensions, and war; and therefore you would better tell me\nwhich one of the above four, I am to adopt now.\n\n\n\n4-7. The ministers said :-- O King! One should always speak true and at the\nsame time pleasant; the wise ones should then select only those which are\nbeneficial and apply them. O King! As a medicine, though bitter, cures\ndiseases, so true words, though appearing unpleasant, lead to beneficial\nresults. Those that are simply pleasant, are generally injurious as to their\neffects. O Lord of the Earth! The bearers and approvers of truth both are very\nrare; truth speakers also are very difficult to be seen; laudatory sycophancy\nis found in a great measure in this world. O King! Nobody in the three worlds\nknows what will be good or what will lead to inauspicious results? How can we\nthen definitely pronounce our judgment in this difficult matter?\n\n\n\n8-9. The King said :-- Let each of you say separately, according to his own\nintellect, what is his opinion; I will hear them all and consider\n\n\n\np. 390\n\n\n\nfor myself. Clever persons should hear the opinions of several persons, then\njudge for himself what is the best and then adopt that as what is to be done.\n\n\n\n10\\. Vyasa said :-- Hearing his words, the powerful Virupak _s_ a came out\nforemost of all and began to say pleasant words to the King.\n\n\n\n11-16. O King! Please take for certain, what has been spoken by that ordinary\nwoman, swelled with vanity, as words simply to scare you. The efforts and\ncourage of a woman are known to all; who will be afraid therefore, to hear\nabusive language from a woman, praising her ownself in matters of warfare? O\nKing! You have conquered the three worlds by your own heroic valour; now if\nyou acknowledge your inferiority, out of fear to a woman, you would be subject\nto very much disgrace in this world. Therefore, O King! I will go alone to\nfight with Cha _nd_ ika and I will kill Her. You can stay here now without any\nfear. O King! See my prowess now; I am just now going with my army and I will\nkill that violent Cha _nd_ ika, maddened with pride, or I will tie Her down by\na coil of snakes and bring Her before you; then that Lady, seeing Herself\nhelpless, will become quite submissive to you; there is no doubt in this.\n\n\n\n17-30. Vyasa said :-- Hearing these words of Virupak _s_ a, Durdhara said :--\nO King! Virupak _s_ a is very intelligent; what he has said just now is all\nreasonable and true. O King! You are intelligent; hear my words full of truth\nalso. As far as I think, I consider that woman with beautiful teeth as\npassionate. For that woman of broad hips has expressed a desire to bring you\nunder control by making you fearful; the mistresses, proud of their beauty\ngenerally use such words when they become passionate. When they behave in this\nway, people call these amorous gestures. These crooked words of mistresses are\nthe chief causes in attracting dear persons unto them. Those who are skilled\nin the art of love affair, some of them can know these things thoroughly well.\nO King! That woman has said, \xc2\x93I will pierce and kill you by arrows, face to\nface, in the battlefield.\xc2\x94 The sense of this is different. The wise persons\nthat are clever and experienced in the art of finding out the cause, declare\nthat the above sentence is pregnant with deep and esoteric meaning. You can\neasily see that the handsome women have no other arrows with them; their side-\nglances are their arrows. And their words carry their hidden meanings, and,\nexpressing their desires, are their flowers. O King! Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and\nMahes\xc2\x92a even have no powers to shoot arrows at you; how can, then, that\nhelpless woman, who appears so passionate, dart real arrows at you? O King!\nThat lady said :-- \xc2\x93O Stupid! I will kill your King by my arrow-like eye-\nsight.\xc2\x94 But the messenger was wanting in that power to appreciate; so he, no\ndoubt, understood her words in their\n\n\n\np. 391\n\n\n\ncontrary sense. The saying of that lady, \xc2\x93I will lay your lord in the death-\nbed in the battle-field\xc2\x94 is to be taken in the light of inverted sexual\nintercourse, where woman is above the man. Her utterance, \xc2\x93I will take away\nthe vitality (life) of your lord\xc2\x94 is also significant. The semen virile is\nknown as the vitality (life). Therefore the above expression means that she\nwill make you devoid of your virility. There can be no other meaning. O King!\nThose women that are excellent shew by too much of their covert expressions\n(innuendos) that they select and like very much their beloved. The experts\nonly in these amorous affairs will be able to appreciate these things. Knowing\nthus, dealings ought to be made with Her so that the harmony in amorous\nsentiments be not broken. O King! Sama (conciliation) and Dana (gifts) are the\ntwo means to be adopted; there is no other way. By these two, that Lady,\nwhether she be proud or angry, is sure to have brought under control; I will\ngo now and bring Her before you by such sweet words. O King! What is the use\nof my talking too much? I will make Her submissive to you like a slave girl.\n\n\n\n31-44. Vyasa said :-- Hearing those words of Durdhara, the Danava Tamra, who\nwas very experienced in finding out the real nature, said :-- \xc2\x93I am telling\nyou what is sanctioned by virtue and is at the same time full of sweet amorous\nfeelings, pregnant with deep meanings. Kindly hear; O Giver of honour! This\nintelligent woman is not at all passionate nor devoted to you; nor has that\nwoman used any covert expressions to you. O Great Hero! This is strange indeed\nthat a Lady, beautiful, handsome, and of strange features, at the same time\nalone and helpless, has come here to fight. A good-looking woman, powerful,\nand having eighteen hands is never heard of, nor ever seen by me in these\nthree worlds. She is holding in each of Her hands powerful weapons. O king!\nAll these seem to be the contrary actions of Time. O King! I saw ominous\ndreams during the night; and I conclude, therefore, that great dangers are\nover our heads. Early in the morning twilight, I saw in my dream that a woman,\nwearing a black raiment, was weeping in the inner courtyard; that some\ninauspicious events are forthcoming can be easily judged from the above. O\nKing! The birds were screaming hoarsely in every house and various calamitous\nevents were seen in various houses; at this time that woman, firmly resolved,\nwas challenging you to fight; it, therefore seems to me that there is\nsomething very serious in this matter. O Lord! This woman is neither human,\nnor a Gandharvi, nor the wife of any Asura. Only to cause delusion to us, she,\nthis wondrous Maya has been created by the gods. O King! In no case, weakness\nis to be resorted; it is wise by all means to fight as best as possible; what\nis inevitable will come to pass; this is my opinion. No one is able to\nunriddle the doings\n\n\n\np. 392\n\n\n\nof the Devas, whether they would be auspicious or inauspicious. Therefore\nintelligent ones should weigh pros and cons carefully and remain patient and\nsteady. O King! Life or death is at the hands of Destiny; Nobody, therefore,\ncan do it otherwise.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n45-51. Hearing this, Mahi _s_ asura said :-- \xc2\x93O Highly fortunate Tamra!\nBetter, then, stand for fight, fully resolved and go to that Lady, beautiful,\nand conquer Her according to rules of justice and bring Her before me. In case\nShe does not come under your control in fight, kill Her; but if She comes\nround, then show Her honour; do not kill Her. O All-knowing! You are a great\nhero and at the same thoroughly conversant with Kama S\xc2\x92astra (science of\nlove); therefore conquer that Fair One by any means you can. O valiant Tamra,\nof mighty prowess! Go then with a mighty force and ponder over again and again\nand find out Her intention. Is She prompted by passion or by real inimical\nfeeling or by any other motive? Try to find out whose Maya is this? Know all\nthese beforehand; then find out the remedy; next fight with Her according to\nyour strength and prowess. Weakness should not be shown nor merciless\nbehaviour is to be resorted; you should behave with Her according to the bent\nof Her mind.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n52\\. Vyasa said :-- O king! Thus hearing the King\xc2\x92s words, Tamra coming as if\nunder the sway of Death, saluted the king Mahi _s_ a and marched away with his\narmy.\n\n\n\n53-66. That wicked Danava, who, on his way, began to see all the fearful\ninauspicious signs, indicative of Death, became surprised and was caught with\nfear. When he arrived at the spot, he saw the Devi standing on a lion, while\nShe was decorated with all the weapons and instruments, and all the Devas were\nchanting hymns to Her. Tamra, then bowed down before Her with humility and\nmodesty and addressed Her with sweet words, according to the rules of the\npolicy of conciliation. \xc2\x93O Devi! Mahi _s_ a, the lord of the Daityas, has\nbecome enchanted on hearing Your beauty and qualifications and has become\ndesirous to marry You. O Beautiful One! You would better be graciously pleased\nwith that conqueror of the Immortals, the Mahi _s_ asura; O Thou of delicate\nlimbs! Make him your husband and enjoy all the exquisite pleasures of the\nNandana garden as best as you can. The end and aim of attaining this human\nform, beautiful in every respect and the abode of all bliss, is to enjoy, in\nevery way, all the pleasures of human existence and to avoid the sources of\nall troubles. This is the rule.\n\n\n\n\xc2\x93O Thou of beautiful thighs like those of the young of an elephant! Your soft\nand delicate lotus-like hands are fit to play only with nice balls of\n\n\n\np. 393\n\n\n\nflowers; why then are You holding in Your hands all the weapons and arrows?\nWhat is the use of holding ordinary arrows, when those two eye-brows like\nbows, are existing with You? What need have you to take ordinary arrows when\nyou are graced with those piercing eye sights, your arrows. The war is\nexceedingly painful in this world; those who know thus ought never to fight.\nIt is only those human beings that are prompted by greed that fight with each\nother. What to speak of those sharpened arrows, one ought not to fight with\nflowers even; O Devi! You can well say who is it that feels pleasure, when\none\xc2\x92s own body is pierced? Therefore, O Delicate One! Gladly you can worship\nMahi _s_ a, the lord of the world and the object of worship of the Devas and\nDanavas. Then he will satisfy all your desires. What more to say, you will no\ndoubt be his queen-consort. O Devi! If one tries one\xc2\x92s best, it is doubtful\nwhether one would be crowned with success; therefore keep my this request; you\nwill surely get all the best pleasures. O Beautiful! You are well acquainted\nwith all the politics; therefore you better enjoy thoroughly the pleasures of\nthe kingdom for full many years. And if you marry Mahi _s_ a you will have\nbeautiful sons and those sons again will be kings; and enjoying the pleasures\nof your full grown womanhood, you will no doubt, be happy in your old age.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nHere ends the Eleventh Chapter of the Fifth Book on the appearing of the\nDanava Tamra before the Devi in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, the Maha Pura _n_\nam, of 18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 12](bk05ch12.htm)\n\n'
