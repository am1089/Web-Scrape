(The assertion that there is scriptural authority for the pradhana, &c.\ncan) also not (be based) on the mention of the number (of the Sa _n_ khya\ncategories), on account of the diversity (of the categories) and on account of\nthe excess (over the number of those categories).\n\nThe attempt to base the Sa _n_ khya doctrine on the mantra speaking of the a\n_g_ a having failed, the Sa _n_ khya again comes forward and points to another\nmantra: \'He in whom the five "five-people" and the ether rest, him alone I\nbelieve to be the Self; I who know believe him to be Brahman\' (B _ri_. Up. IV,\n4, 17). In this mantra we have one word which expresses the number five, viz.\nthe five-people, and then another word, viz. five, which qualifies the former;\nthese two words together therefore convey the idea of five pentads, i.e.\ntwenty-five. Now as many beings as the number twenty-five presupposes, just so\nmany categories the Sankhya system counts. Cp. Sa _n_ khya Karika, 3: \'The\nfundamental causal substance (i.e. the pradhana) is not an effect. Seven\n(substances), viz. the Great one (Intellect), and so on, are causal substances\nas well as effects. Sixteen are effects. The soul is neither a causal\nsubstance nor an effect.\'\n\np. 258\n\n[paragraph continues] As therefore the number twenty-five, which occurs in the\nscriptural passage quoted, clearly refers to the twenty-five categories taught\nin the Sa _n_ khya-sm _ri_ ti, it follows that the doctrine of the pradhana,\n&c. rests on a scriptural basis.\n\nTo this reasoning we make the following reply.--It is impossible to base the\nassertion that the pradhana, &c. have Scripture in their favour on the\nreference to their number which you pretend to find in the text, \'on account\nof the diversity of the Sa _n_ khya categories.\' The Sa _n_ khya categories,\nhave each their individual difference, and there are no attributes belonging\nin common to each pentad on account of which the number twenty-five could be\ndivided into five times five. For a number of individually separate things\ncan, in general, not be combined into smaller groups of two or three, &c.\nunless there be a special reason for such combination.--Here the Sa _n_ khya\nwill perhaps rejoin that the expression five (times) five is used only to\ndenote the number twenty-five which has five pentads for its constituent\nparts; just as the poem says, \'five years and seven Indra did not rain,\'\nmeaning only that there was no rain for twelve years.--But this explanation\nalso is not tenable. In the first place, it is liable to the objection that it\nhas recourse to indirect indication.  1 In the second place, the second \'five\'\nconstitutes a compound with the word \'people,\' the Brahma _n_ a-accent showing\nthat the two form one word only.  2 To the same conclusion we are led by\nanother passage also (Taitt. Sam _h_. I, 6, 2, 2, pa _\xc3\xb1 k_ana _m_ tva pa _\xc3\xb1\nk_a _g_ ananam, &c.) where the two terms constitute one word, have one accent\nand one case-termination.\n\np. 259\n\n[paragraph continues] The word thus being a compound there is neither a\nrepetition of the word \'five,\' involving two pentads, nor does the one five\nqualify the other, as the mere secondary member of a compound cannot be\nqualified by another word.--But as the people are already denoted to be five\nby the compound \'five-people,\' the effect of the other \'five\' qualifying the\ncompound will be that we understand twenty-five people to be meant; just as\nthe expression \'five five-bundles\' (pa _\xc3\xb1 k_a pa _\xc3\xb1 k_apulya _h_ ) conveys the\nidea of twenty-five bundles.--The instance is not an analogous one, we reply.\nThe word \'pa _\xc3\xb1 k_apuli\' denotes a unity (i.e. one bundle made up of five\nbundles) and hence when the question arises, \'How many such bundles are\nthere?\' it can be qualified by the word \'five,\' indicating that there are five\nsuch bundles. The word pa _\xc3\xb1 k_a _g_ ana _h_ , on the other hand, conveys at\nonce the idea of distinction (i.e. of five distinct things), so that there is\nno room at all for a further desire to know how many people there are, and\nhence no room for a further qualification. And if the word \'five\' be taken as\na qualifying word it can only qualify the numeral five (in five-people); the\nobjection against which assumption has already been stated.--For all these\nreasons the expression the five five-people cannot denote the twenty-five\ncategories of the Sa _n_ khyas.--This is further not possible \'on account of\nthe excess.\' For on the Sa _n_ khya interpretation there would be an excess\nover the number twenty-five, owing to the circumstance of the ether and the\nSelf being mentioned separately. The Self is spoken of as the abode in which\nthe five five-people rest, the clause \'Him I believe to be the Self\' being\nconnected with the \'in whom\' of the antecedent clause. Now the Self is the\nintelligent soul of the Sa _n_ khyas which is already included in the twenty-\nfive categories, and which therefore, on their interpretation of the passage,\nwould here be mentioned once as constituting the abode and once as what rests\nin the abode! If, on the other hand, the soul were supposed not to be compiled\nin the twenty-five categories, the Sa _n_ khya would thereby abandon his own\ndoctrine of the categories being twenty-five. The same\n\np. 260\n\nremarks apply to the separate mention made of the ether.--How, finally, can\nthe mere circumstance of a certain number being referred to in the sacred text\njustify the assumption that what is meant are the twenty-five Sa _n_ khya\ncategories of which Scripture speaks in no other place? especially if we\nconsider that the word _g_ ana has not the settled meaning of category, and\nthat the number may be satisfactorily accounted for on another interpretation\nof the passage.\n\nHow, then, the Sa _n_ khya will ask, do you interpret the phrase \'the five\nfive-people?\'--On the ground, we reply, of the rule Pa _n_ ini II, 1, 50,\naccording to which certain compounds formed with numerals are mere names. The\nword pa _\xc3\xb1 k_a _g_ ana _h_ thus is not meant to convey the idea of the number\nfive, but merely to denote certain classes of beings. Hence the question may\npresent itself, How many such classes are there? and to this question an\nanswer is given by the added numeral \'five.\' There are certain classes of\nbeings called five-people, and these classes are five. Analogously we may\nspeak of the seven seven- _ri_ shis, where again the compound denotes a class\nof beings merely, not their number.--Who then are those five-people?--To this\nquestion the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[258:1](sbe34122.htm#fr_239) Indication (laksha _n_ a, which consists in this\ncase in five times five being used instead of twenty-five) is considered as an\nobjectionable mode of expression, and therefore to be assumed in\ninterpretation only where a term can in no way be shown to have a direct\nmeaning.\n\n[258:2](sbe34122.htm#fr_240) That pa _\xc3\xb1 k_a _g_ ana _h_ is only one word\nappears from its having only one accent, viz. the udatta on the last syllable,\nwhich udatta becomes anudatta according to the rules laid down in the Bhashika\nSutra for the accentuation of the _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4, 12](sbe34123.htm)\n\n'
