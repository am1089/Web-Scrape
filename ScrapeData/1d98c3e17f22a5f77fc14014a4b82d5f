(This scripture) also shows, and it is likewise stated in Sm _ri_ ti.\n\nThat Brahman is without any difference is proved by those scriptural passages\nalso which expressly deny that it possesses any other characteristics; so,\ne.g. \'Next follows the teaching by No, no\' (B _ri_. Up. II, 3, 6); \'It is\ndifferent from the known, it is also above the unknown\' (Ke. Up. I, 4); \'From\nwhence all speech, with the mind, turns away unable to reach it\' (Taitt. Up.\nII, 9). Of a similar purport is that scriptural passage which relates how\nBahva, being questioned about Brahman by Vashkalin, explained it to him by\nsilence, \'He said to him, "Learn Brahman, O friend," and became silent. Then,\non a second and third question, he replied, "I am teaching you indeed, but you\ndo not understand. Silent is that Self."\' The same teaching is conveyed by\nthose Sm _ri_ ti-texts which deny of Brahman all other characteristics; so,\ne.g. \'I will proclaim that which is the object of knowledge, knowing which one\nreaches immortality; the highest Brahman without either beginning or end,\nwhich cannot be said either to be or not to be\' (Bha. Gita XIII, 12). Of a\nsimilar purport is another Sm _ri_ ti-passage, according to which the omniform\nNaraya _n_ a instructed Narada, \'The cause, O Narada, of your seeing me\nendowed with the qualities of all beings is the Maya emitted by me; do not\ncognize me as being such (in reality).\'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2, 18](sbe38121.htm)\n\n'
