Shree Krishnu and Bulram were\nsitting amongst them, very thoughtful and anxious, and saying, "Who has\ncarried off the child hence?" They were talking in this strain, and there was\nsuch weeping and lamentation in the female apartments, that no one could hear\nanother speaking. On the arrival of Narud Jee, all persons present, both male\nand female, rose up to meet him, and came and stood in his presence greatly\nagitated and emaciated with grief, sad and shedding tears and lamenting. They\nafterwards joined their hands, and bowed their heads with great\nsubmissiveness, and, expressing the deepest emotion, began to enquire from\nNarud Jee, "Say, truly, O sage! in order that we may preserve our sinking\nlives, where shall we receive intelligence of Unroodru? Say, O holy man! so\nthat we may rely on your words." Shree Narud Jee replied, "Suffer not any\nanxiety of mind, and banish. all sorrow, Unroodru Jee is alive and well at\nShronitpore. He has gone there, and enjoyed amorous pleasure with the daughter\nof Banasoor; for which reason, he has laid hold of and bound him with a\nrunning noose; he will not, on any account,\n\np. 314\n\nrelease Unroodru without fighting. I have mentioned this secret to you; form\nyour future plans accordingly."\n\nO great king! Narud Jee departed, when he had given them this intelligence;\nafterwards all the descendants of Judoo went to the Raja Oogursen, and said,\n"O great king! we have received exact intelligence that Unroodru Jee is at\nShronitpore, at the house of Banasoor; he has enjoyed the Raja\'s daughter, and\nthe Raja has, in consequence thereof, kept him bound with a running noose.\nWhat are your orders now to us?" On hearing this account, Raja Oogursen said,\n"Take all my army with you, and use your utmost endeavours to release and\nbring Unroodru here."\n\nWhen Oogursen had thus spoken, all the Judoos, O great king! took the Raja\'s\narmy with them, and accompanied Bulram, and Shree Krishnu Chund, and\nPurdiyomun Jee, mounting on the sovereign of the feathered race, arrived\nbefore them all at Shronitpore.\n\nHaving narrated thus much, Shree Shookdeo Jee said, O great king! when Bulram\nJee, taking all the army of Oogursen and sounding the large kettle-drum, went\nfrom the city of Dwarka to Shronitpore, it is impossible to describe the\nsplendid appearance of his cavalcade. In front of all were must" elephants in\nrows, with huge tusks; on which the large; kettle-drum was sounded, and flags\nand banners were waving. Behind these, was another row of elephants with\nhowdahs, on which the bravest, most heroical and the mightiest of the Judoos\nwere seated, wearing coats of mail and helmets, and completely armed;\nimmediately following, were successive lines of chariots, after them troops of\nhorsemen were moving along on horses of all colours with collars, harness,\ntasselled ornaments and iron armour, making them pace as in the manege, and\nmove in an artificial manner, and dance about and jump and plunge. In the\nmidst of them, panegyrists were singing songs of praise, and bards were\nsinging war songs. Behind them came the foot soldiers, thick as a host of\nlocusts,\n\np. 315\n\narmed with shields, swords, knives, daggers, spears, javelins, bows, arrows,\nclubs, quoits and every description of warlike weapon. The sound of the drums\nand other musical instruments in the midst of this procession, contributed\ngreatly to the fine effect and beauty of the scene. The dust flew up, and\nspread to the sky, the sun was hid and became like night; the ruddy goose and\nits mate were \'separated; wives enjoyed themselves with their lords, the lotus\nbloomed, and the white esculent lotus withered, [nocturnal](errata.htm#17)\nanimals prowled about, supposing that it was night.\n\nHaving recited thus much of\' the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee, said,--O great\nking! when Bulram Jee, advancing with great pomp and noise, with a force of\ntwelve complete armies, and destroying all the forts, strongholds and castles\nof the Raja, and laying waste his country, arrived at Shronitpore, and Shree\nKrishnu Chund and Purdiyomun Jee arrived also, some one in great alarm, and\ndistracted with fear, said to Banasoor, with joined hands and bowing his head,\n"O great king! Krishnu and Bulram have advanced with their whole army, a and\nthey have razed all the strongholds, forts and castles in our country and have\nencompassed the city on every side. What now are your orders?" Banasoor was\ngreatly enraged at these words; and, having summoned all his great demons,\nsaid to them, "Take all; your armies outside the city, and go and oppose\nKrishnu and Bulram, I will also come by and bye."\n\nOn receiving this order, O great king! the demons immediately took with them\ntwelve complete armies, and being fully equipped with arms of all kinds, stood\nready to encounter Shree Krishnu and Bulram Jee; and in rear of them, Banasoor\nworshipping calling to mind, and meditating upon Shree Muhadeo Jee, was also\nready for battle.\n\nShookdeo, the sage, said,--O great king! whilst Shivu Jee was meditating, his\nseat shook, and his meditation was interrupted; on reflecting upon this, he\nthought to himself, "A worshipper of\n\np. 316\n\nmine is in a difficulty; I must go now and remove his anxiety." When having\nformed this resolution, he had assumed half the body of Parbuttee, fastened\nhis matted hair, rubbed his body over with ashes, eaten a large quantity of\nhemp, swallow-wort and thorn-apple, wearing a brahminical thread, composed of\nwhite snakes, clad in an elephant\'s hide, with a necklace of heads and garland\nof snakes, holding a trident, bow, hand-drum and skull; riding upon the bull\nNandya accompanied by ghosts, goblins, spectres, witches, female divinities,\nimps, sprites and evil spirits, and taking an army with him, Bholanath came\nforth; his splendid appearance baffles all description; in his ear was an\nornament, consisting of the elephant pearl, on his forehead was the moon; he\nplaced the Ganges on his head, and his eyes were very red, of a very frightful\naspect and appearing in the form of the destroying deity; he proceeded in this\nmanner, with music and singing, and making his army dance; to describe his\nappearance is impossible to be understood, it must be seen. At length, after\nsome little delay, he came with his army to the place where Banasoor was\nstanding with his armies of demons. On seeing Muhadeo, Banasoor was delighted,\nand said, "O sea of compassion! who without you would look after me? Your\nflaming heat will burn them up, how will the Judoos now survive?" He proceeded\nto say, "O great king! make this a fair fight, so that each man may have an\nantagonist opposed to him."\n\nO great king! when Banasoor had thus spoken, on one side, the army of the\ndemons was standing in battle array, and on the other, the descendants of\nJudoo were in a state of preparation; drums began to sound on both sides;\nbrave, bold, resolute and mighty heroes began to arrange their weapons; and\nthe irresolute eunuchs and cowards to fly for their lives from the field of\nbattle. At that time Shivu Jee appeared before Shree Krishnu Chund in the form\nof the destroying deity. Banasoor was opposed to Bulram Jee; Uskundh\nencountered Purdiyomun; and in this manner each man closed\n\np. 317\n\nwith an antagonist. Muhadeo held the bow Pinak in his hand, while the lord of\nthe Judoos had the bow, Sarung. Shivu discharged the arrows of Bruhmu: Shree\nKrishnu Jee cut them off with a weapon of Bruhmu\'s also. Roodru then sent\nforth a mighty wind, which Huri avoided with fire. Muhadeo upon this kindled a\nfire, which Moorari extinguished by pouring down rain, and raised an immense\nflame, which extended to the army of Sudashivu; and burning their beards,\nmustachios and hair, made all the demons appear of a very terrible aspect.\nWhen the army of the demons began to be burnt, and raised a loud cry for\ndeliverance, Bholanath cooled the burnt and half-burnt bodies of the demons,\nghosts and goblins, by pouring down rain; and being greatly enraged was on the\npoint of letting fly the arrows of Narayun: but upon reflection, he abstained\nfrom doing so, and kept them back. After this, Shree Krishnu Jee discharged\nthe arrows of Sloth; and having stupified them all, began to cut down the army\nof demons, just as a husbandman would cut grain. On beholding this exploit,\nwhen Muhadeo thought to himself, and said, "That it would be absolutely\nnecessary to engage in and prolong the battle, so as to involve universal\ndestruction," Uskundh, mounted a peacock, and ascending into mid-air, began to\ndischarge arrows upon the army of Shree Krishnu Jee. Then Purdiyomun exclaimed\nto Huri, "Some one is fighting from above, mounted on a peacock, give the\norder to fight with energy, and I will kill him now, and he shall fall upon\nthe ground." On hearing this, Krishnu gave the order, when Purdiyomun\ndischarged an arrow, which hit the peacock, and Uskundh fell down. Banasoor\nwas highly indignant at the fall of Uskundh, and bending five bows and placing\ntwo arrows on each bow, began to shower forth his arrows like rain, and Shree\nKrishnu Chund cut them off mid-way.\n\nO great king! at that time, drums and tambourines resounded on all sides;\nbards sang chimes in music, streams of blood gushed forth, as though squirted\nfrom wounds; in every\n\np. 318\n\ndirection was seen blood, as red as _holee_ powder; in the midst ghosts,\ngoblins and spectres in various frightful forms, wandered about, playing all\nsorts of antic tricks; rivers of blood flowed like streams of red colour, it\ncould not be called a battle, but seemed to be more like a _holee_ on both\nsides. When the battle had been raging for some time, Shree Krishnu Jee\ndischarged an arrow, so as to kill Banasoor\'s charioteer, and the horses\nstarted; on the death of his charioteer, Banasoor fled from the field, and\nShree Krishnu pursued him.\n\nHaving narrated thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee, said,--O great\nking! on hearing the news of Banasoor\'s flight, his mother, whose name was\nKutra, of a hideous appearance, with dishevelled hair, came naked before Shree\nKrishnu Chund, and began to call out; on seeing her, Krishnu shut his eyes and\nturned his back upon her, when she spoke; in the mean while Banasoor fled, and\nagain rallied his army.\n\nO great king! Kutra did not withdraw from the presence of Shree Krishnu Jee,\nuntil Banasoor had returned with a complete army, fully arrayed. Banasoor, on\nhis arrival, engaged in a mighty battle, but could not stand before Krishnu;\nand running away again went to Muhadeo. Beholding Banasoor in a state of fear,\nShivu Jee was greatly enraged, and having summoned a fever of a poisonous and\ninflammatory nature, caused it to spread in the army of Shree Krishnu Jee. The\nfever, which was very violent and burning, whose heat equalled that of the\nsun, with three heads, nine feet, six hands, three eyes, and of a frightful\nappearance, came and penetrated the army of Shree Krishnu Chund. The\ndescendants of Judoo began to be burnt by its heat, and to shake and tremble;\nat length, after having suffered very great pain, and being alarmed, the\ndescendants of Judoo came to Shree Krishnu Jee and said, "O great king! the\nfever of Shivu has come, and raged violently amongst our whole army, and\ndestroyed many; be pleased now to save us from its fury, otherwise not a\nsingle member of the family of Judoo will escape alive."\n\np. 319\n\nO great king! having heard this request, and seeing that they were all\ndistressed, Hun sent forth the ague, which rushed upon Muhadeo\'s fever. On\nseeing the ague, Muhadeo\'s fever fled through fear; and continuing his flight,\ncame to Sudashivu Jee. The inflammatory fever then said to Muhadeo, "Afford me\nan asylum, or the fever of Krishnu will destroy me." Muhadeo Jee replied,\n"There is no one in the three worlds, except Shree Krishnu Chund, who can\ndrive away the fever he has sent, it is therefore most advisable for you to go\nto Shree Moorari, the friend of his worshippers." Having heard of Shivu\'s\nspeech, and reflected upon it, the inflammatory fever went into the presence\nof Shree Krishnu Chund, the root of joy; and joining his hands, beseeching in\na most submissive manner and making many entreaties, said, "O sea of\ncompassion, the brother of the poor, the purifier of sinners and kind to the\nneedy! be pleased to pardon my fault and save, me from your fever. O Krishnu!\nyou are the lord of Bruhmu and all other divinities. Your power, O lord of the\nworld! is incomprehensible; it was you who created and arranged the world. All\nthe delusive power in the universe belongs to you. O Krishnu! I have found out\nyour compassionate nature, and having obtained knowledge, look upon you as the\ncreator of the world." The benignant Huri replied, "You have come to seek\nprotection from me, and have therefore escaped, otherwise you would not have\nescaped with life. I forgive your present fault; but do not again direct your\nattacks against my worshippers and servants, this is my order to you." The\nfever said, "O sea of compassion! whoever shall hear this history, ague,\ntertian ague and tertian fever shall never attack him." After this, Shree\nKrishnu Chund said, "Go now to Muhadeo; do not stay here, or else my fever\nwill harass you." On receiving this order, the inflammatory fever took leave,\nand having made an obeisance, went off to Muhadeo, and the pain of the fever\nwas entirely subdued.\n\np. 320\n\nHaving recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee, said,--O great\nking! whoever shall hear this conversation need never be afraid of fever.\nAfter this Banasoor was very angry; and, taking bows and arrows in all his\nhands, came opposite to Krishnu and bawled out, "I have fought a severe battle\nwith you; but my inclinations are not yet satisfied." When having thus spoken,\nhe began to discharge arrows with all his hands, Shree Krishnu Chund Jee let\nloose the quoit, Soodursun, and cut off all his hands, except four, with the\nsame celerity as any one would cut the boughs of a tree. On his hands being\ncut off, Banasoor fell down stupified, and a river of blood flowed from his\nwounds in which his arms appeared like alligators. The heads of the elephants,\nwhich had been cut off, seemed like drowning crocodiles. Chariots were carried\nalong the stream, like baskets for irrigating fields and like boats. In\ndifferent places on the field of battle, dogs, jackals, vultures and other\nbirds and beasts were tearing and rending, and fighting and contending for the\ndead bodies; and crows were flying off with eyes, which they had picked out\nfrom heads.\n\nShree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great king! on seeing this state of the battle\nfield, Banasoor was very sad, and began to feel regret, and afterwards, being\ndeprived of all strength, went to Muhadeo Jee. Then Roodru, after thinking on\nthe matter, said to him, "You must now endeavour to please and captivate\nHuri." With these words, Shree Muhadeo Jee, taking Banasoor with him, and\nreading the Vedas to him on the road, came to the place where Shree Krishnu\nChund was standing on the field of battle. Throwing Banasoor down at the feet\nof Krishnu, Shivu Jee said, with joined hands, "O merciful to those who come\nfor sanctuary! this Banasoor has now come to you for protection; be pleased to\nlook upon him with compassion, and do not retain in your mind a recollection\nof his crime. You repeatedly descend upon the earth, to remove the burthens of\nthe world, and to destroy the wicked, and to\n\np. 321\n\nsave the universe. You are, O lord! invisible, impenetrable, without end; for\nthe sake of your worshippers, you come, and are manifest in the world,\notherwise, you constantly remain in the form of the embodied spirit. The form\nof the spirit is this; heaven is his head; the sky, his navel; the earth, his\nfeet; the sea, his belly; Indru, his arms; hills, his nails; clouds, the hair\nof his head; trees, the hair of his body; the moon and sun, his eyes; Bruhmu,\nhis mind; Roodru, his pride; the air, his breath; the closing and opening of\nhis eye-lids, night and day; thunder, his voice. Such is the form in which you\nconstantly dwell: and no one can comprehend it. And this world is a sea of\ntrouble, the water of which is filled with anxiety and delusion. O lord!\nwithout the aid of the boat of your name, no one can cross this vast and very\ndifficult sea; and many flounder and are drowned, in attempting it. Whosoever\nhas obtained mortal form, and shall not offer adoration and prayers to you,\nand shall not keep you in constant remembrance, he shall lose his religion and\nshall aggravate his sins. He, who has come into the world, and has not called\nupon your name, has abandoned the water of life and drank poison. In\nwhosesoever\'s breast you dwell, he has obtained pardon on account of his faith\nby celebrating with songs your good qualities." Again, Shree Muhadeo Jee said,\n"O sea of compassion and brother of the poor! your greatness is boundless. Who\nhas power to describe it, and who can understand your actions? Take compassion\nupon me now, and forgive this Banasoor\'s transgression; and grant him faith in\nyou; he also possesses a title to be considered your worshipper, because he is\na portion of the lineage of Purhlad, your adorer." Shree Krishnu Chund\nreplied, "Shivu Jee! there is no difference between you and me; and whoever\nsupposes there is a difference, he will fall into the great hell, and shall\nnever obtain me, (that is, gain my favour;) whoever has meditated upon you,\nwill, at his latter end, obtain my favour, this Banasoor called\n\np. 322\n\nupon your name without deceit; and, for this reason, I have made him four-\narmed; I have protected all on whom you have conferred boons, and will protect\nthose also, to whom you may in future grant blessings."\n\nO great king! when Krishnu had uttered these words, Sudashivu Jee made an\nobeisance; and, taking leave, went to the mountain Kuelas, accompanied by his\narmy; and Shree Krishnu remained standing where he was; Banasoor then joining\nhis hands and bowing his head, said, submissively, "O lord of the poor! as you\nhave compassionately pardoned me, be pleased now to make pure your servant\'s\nhouse by coming to it, and take away Unroodru Jee and Ookha with you." On\nhearing this, Shree Beharee, the benefactor of his worshippers, taking\nPurdiyomun Jee with him, went to Banasoor\'s abode.\n\nO great king! Banasoor being then highly delighted, conducted Krishnu, with a\nwarm welcome, to his house, spreading silken cloths on the road, afterwards he\nwashed his feet and took the water with which his feet had been washed, and\nsipping it in his hand put it on his head. He then began to say, "The water in\nwhich his feet have been washed, so difficult to be obtained by all, I have\nthis day obtained by the favour of Huri, and obliterated the sins of each\nbirth, he who has drank of the water of the Ganges will, undoubtedly, obtain\nheaven; he who has seen the Bhageruttee has gained the whole world."\n\nO great king! having thus spoken and brought Unroodru Jee and Ookha, he said\nin the presence of Krishnu, joining his hands, "Be pleased to forgive my\nfault; what was predestined has happened, I give this Ookha as a servant to\nyou." When he had thus spoken, Banasoor gave his daughter in marriage,\naccording to the injunctions of the Vedas, and bestowed upon her a boundless\ndowry.\n\nHaving narrated thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great\nking! on the marriage taking place, Shree\n\np. 323\n\n[paragraph continues] Krishnu Chund, having restored Banasoor\'s confidence,\nseated him upon the royal throne; and, accompanied by his grandson and grand-\ndaughter, took leave, and sounding the large kettledrum, went thence, with all\nthe descendants of Judoo, to the city of Dwarka. On hearing of their arrival\nall the inhabitants of Dwarka went outside of the city, and escorted Krishnu\nin musical procession; at that time the inhabitants of the city sang songs of\nrejoicing, and indulged in festivities in the markets, roads, cross-roads,\nsheds and houses; and in the royal palace Shree Rookmunee and all the women\nsang songs of congratulation, and observed all the ceremonies usual on festive\noccasions; the gods, seated in their chariots, and raining down flowers from\nthe sky, raised cries of victory; and joy was universally diffused throughout\nthe city, both inside each house and outside. Bulram, the abode of happiness,\nand Shree Krishnu Chund, the root of joy, having then allowed all the\ndescendants of Judoo to take leave, went to live at their ease and happily at\nthe royal palace, taking Unroodru and Ookha with them; the wives of Krishnu\nwere delighted at beholding Ookha; when she was brought into the palace, her\nmother-in-law gave her a blessing, and clasped her into her bosom; and being\nhighly pleased at seeing her, adorned her with ornaments.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LXV](psa66.htm)\n\n'
