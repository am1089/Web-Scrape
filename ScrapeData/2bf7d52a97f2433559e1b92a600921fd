Prayer to Bhava and Sarva for protection from dangers.\n\n1\\. O Bhava and Sarva, be merciful, do not attack (us); ye lords of beings,\nlords of cattle, reverence be to you twain! Discharge not your arrow even\nafter it has been laid on (the bow), and has been drawn! Destroy not our\nbipeds and our quadrupeds!  \n2\\. Prepare not our bodies for the dog, or the jackal; for the aliklavas, the\nvultures, and the black birds! Thy greedy insects, O lord of cattle\n(pasupate), and thy birds shall not get us to devour!  \n3\\. Reverence we offer, O Bhava, to thy roaring, to thy breath, and to thy\ninjurious qualities; reverence to thee, O Rudra, thousand-eyed, immortal!  \n4\\. We offer reverence to thee from the east, from the north, and from the\n-south; from (every) domain, and from heaven. Reverence be to thy atmosphere!  \n5\\. To thy face, O lord of cattle, to thy eyes, O Bhava, to thy skin, to thy\nform, thy appearance, (and to thy aspect) from behind, reverence be!  \n6\\. To thy limbs, to thy belly, to thy tongue, to thy mouth, to thy teeth, to\nthy smell (nose), reverence be!  \n7\\. May we not conflict with Rudra, the archer with the dark crest, the\nthousand-eyed, powerful one, the slayer of Ardhaka!  \n8\\. Bhava shall steer clear from us on all sides, Bhava shall steer clear from\nus, as fire from water! May he not bear malice towards us: reverence be to\nhim!  \n9\\. Four times, eight times, be reverence to Bhava, ten times be reverence to\nthee, O lord of cattle! To thy (charge) have been assigned these five (kinds\nof) cattle: cows, horses, men, goats and sheep.  \n10\\. Thine, O strong god (ugra), are the four regions, thine the sky, thine\nthe earth, and thine this broad atmosphere; thine is this all that has a\nspirit and has breath upon the earth.  \n11\\. Thine is this broad, treasure-holding receptacle within which all worlds\nare contained. Do thou spare us, O lord of cattle: reverence be to thee! Far\nfrom us shall go the jackals, evil omens, dogs; far shall go (the mourning\nwomen) who bewail rnisfortune with dishevelled hair!  \n12\\. Thou, O crested (god), carriest in (thy hand), that smites thousands, a\nyellow, golden bow that slays hundreds; Rudra's arrow, the missile of the\ngods, flies abroad: reverence be to it, in whatever direction from here (it\nflies)!  \n13\\. The adversary who lurks and seeks to overcome thee, O Rudra, upon him\nthou dost fasten thyself from behind, as (the hunter) that follows the trail\nof a wounded (animal).  \n14\\. Bhava and Rudra, united and concordant, both strong (ugrau), ye advance\nto deeds of heroism: reverence be to both of them, in whatever direction (they\nare) from here!  \n15\\. Reverence be to thee coming, reverence to thee going; reverence, O Rudra,\nbe to thee standing, and reverence, also, to thee sitting!  \n16\\. Reverence in the evening, reverence in the morning, reverence by\nnight,reverence byday! I have offered reverence to Bhava and to Sarva, both.  \n17\\. Let us not with our tongue offend Rudra, who rushes on, thousand-eyed,\noverseeing all, who hurls (his shafts) forward, who is manifoldly wise!  \n18\\. We approach first the (god) that has dark horses, is black, sable,\ndestructive, terrible, who casts down the car of Kesin: reverence be to him!  \n19\\. Do not hurl at us thy club, thy divine bolt; be not incensed at us, O\nlord of cattle! Shake over some other than us the celestial branch!  \n20\\. Injure us not, interpose for us, spare us, be not angry with us! Let us\nnot contend with thee!  \n21\\. Do not covet our cattle, our men, our goats and sheep! Bend thy course\nelsewhere, O strong god (ugra), slay the offspring of the blasphemers!  \n22\\. He whose missile, fever and cough, assails the single (victim), as the\nsnorting of a stallion, who snatches away (his victims) one by one, to him be\nreverence!  \n23\\. He who dwells fixed in the atmosphere, smiting the blasphemers of the god\nthat do not sacrifice, to him be reverence with ten sakvari-stanzas!  \n24\\. For thee the wild beasts of the forest have been placed in the forest:\nflamingoes, eagles, birds of prey, and fowls. Thy spirit, O lord of cattle, is\nwithin the waters, to strengthen thee the heavenly waters flow.  \n25\\. The dolphins, great serpents (boas), purikayas (water-animals), sea-\nmonsters, fishes, ragasas at which thou shootest-there exists for thee, O\nBhava, no distance, and no barrier. At a glance thou lookest around the entire\nearth; from the eastern thou slayest in the northern ocean.  \n26\\. Do not, O Rudra, contaminate us with fever, or with poison, or with\nheavenly fire: cause this lightning to descend elsewhere than upon us!  \n27\\. Bhava rules the sky, Bhava rules the earth; Bhava has filled the broad:\natmosphere. Reverence be to him in whatever direction from here (he abides)!  \n28\\. O king Bhava, be merciful to thy worshipper, for thou art the lord of\nliving beasts! He who believes the gods exist, to his quadruped and biped be\nmerciful!  \n29\\. Slay neither our great nor our small; neither those of us that are\nriding, nor those that shall ride; neither our father, nor our mother. Cause\nno injury, O Rudra, to our own persons!  \n30\\. To Rudra's howling dogs, who swallow their food without blessing, who\nhave wide jaws, I have made this obeisance.  \n31\\. Reverence, O god, be to thy shouting hosts, reverence to thy long-haired,\nreverence to thy reverenced, reverence to thy devouring hosts! May well-being\nand security be to us!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 28. Prayer to Bhava and Sarva for protection from\ncalamities](av183.htm)\n\n"
