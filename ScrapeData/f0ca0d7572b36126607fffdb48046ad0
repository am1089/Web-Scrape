There is a person not human 3,--\n\n2\\. 'He leads them to Brahman (the conditioned Brahman). This is the path of\nthe Devas.\n\n3\\. 'But they who living in a village practise (a life of) sacrifices, works\nof public utility, and alms, they go to the smoke, from smoke to night, from\nnight to the dark half of the moon, from the dark half of the moon to the six\nmonths when the sun goes to the south. But they do not reach the year.\n\n4\\. 'From the months they go to the world of the fathers, from the world of\nthe fathers to the ether, from the ether to the moon. That is Soma, the king.\nHere they are loved (eaten) by the Devas, yes, the Devas love (eat) them 4.\n\np. 81\n\n5\\. 'Having dwelt there, till their (good) works are consumed, they return\nagain that way as they came 1, to the ether, from the ether to the air. Then\nthe sacrificer, having become air, becomes smoke, having become smoke, he\nbecomes mist,\n\n6\\. 'Having become mist, he becomes a cloud, having become a cloud, he rains\ndown. Then he is born as rice and corn, herbs and trees, sesamum. and beans.\nFrom thence the escape is beset with most difficulties. For whoever the\npersons may be that eat the food, and beget offspring, he henceforth becomes\nlike unto them.\n\np. 82\n\n7\\. 'Those whose conduct has been good, will quickly attain some good birth,\nthe birth of a Brahma _n_ a, or a Kshatriya, or a Vai _s_ ya. But those whose\nconduct has been evil, will quickly attain an evil birth, the birth of a dog,\nor a hog, or a _K_ a _n_ _d_ ala.\n\n8\\. 'On neither of these two ways those small creatures (flies, worms, &c.)\nare continually returning of whom it may be said, Live and die. Theirs is a\nthird place.\n\n'Therefore that world never becomes full 1 (cf. V, 3, 2).\n\np. 83\n\n'Hence let a man take care to himself 1! And thus it is said in the following\n_S_ loka 2:--\n\n9\\. 'A man who steals gold, who drinks spirits,\n\np. 84\n\nwho dishonours his Guru's bed, who kills a Brahman, these four fall, and as a\nfifth he who associates with them.\n\n10\\. 'But he who thus knows the five fires is not defiled by sin even though\nhe associates with them. He who knows this, is pure, clean, and obtains the\nworld of the blessed, yea, he obtains the world of the blessed.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[80:1](sbe01104.htm#fr_251) The doctrine of the five fires, and our being born\nin them, i. e. in heaven, rain, earth, man, and woman.\n\n[80:2](sbe01104.htm#fr_252) Cf. _Kh_. Up. IV, 15, 5.\n\n[80:3](sbe01104.htm#fr_253) Instead of manava, human, or amanava, not human,\nthe B _ri_ h. \xc3\x82r. reads manasa, mental, or created by manas, mind.\n\n[80:4](sbe01104.htm#fr_254) This passage has been translated, 'They are the\nfood of the gods. The gods do eat it.' And this is indeed the literal meaning\nof the words. But bha _g_ (to enjoy) and bhaksh (to eat) are often p. 81 used\nby theosophical writers in India, in the more general sense of cherishing or\nloving, and anna in the sense of an object of desire, love, and protection.\nThe commentators, however, as the use of bhaksh in this sense is exceptional,\nor as it has no support in the use of the ancients, warn us here against a\npossible misunderstanding. If those, they say, who have performed sacrifices\nenter at last into the essence of Soma, the moon, and are eaten by the Devas,\nby Indra, &c., what is the use of their good works? No, they reply, they are\nnot really eaten. Food (anna) means only what is helpful and delightful; it is\nnot meant that they are eaten by morsels, but that they form the delight of\nthe Devas. Thus we hear it said that men, women, and cattle are food for\nkings. And if it is said that women are loved by men, they are, in being\nloved, themselves loving. Thus these men also, being loved by the Devas, are\nhappy and rejoice with the Devas. Their body, in order to be able to rejoice\nin the moon, becomes of a watery substance, as it was said before, that the\nwater, called the Sraddha libation, when offered in heaven, as in the fire of\nthe altar, becomes Soma, the king ( _Kh_. Up. V, 4, 1). That water becomes,\nafter various changes, the body of those who have performed good works, and\nwhen a man is dead and his body burnt ( _Kh_. Up. V, 9, 2), the water rises\nfrom the body upwards with the smoke, and carries him to the moon, where, in\nthat body, he enjoys the fruits of his good works, as long as they last. When\nthey are consumed, like the oil in a lamp, he has to return to a new round of\nexistences.\n\n[81:1](sbe01104.htm#fr_255) But only to a certain point.\n\n[82:1](sbe01104.htm#fr_256) In this manner all the five questions have been\nanswered. First, why in the fifth oblation water is called man; secondly, to\nwhat place men go after death, some by the path of the Devas, others by the\npath of the fathers, others again by neither of these paths; thirdly, how they\nreturn, some returning to Brahman, others returning to the earth; fourthly,\nwhere the paths of the Devas and the fathers diverge, viz. when from the half-\nyear the path of the Devas goes on to the year, while that of the fathers\nbranches off to the world of the fathers; fifthly, why that world, the other\nworld, does never become full, viz. because men either go on to Brahman or\nreturn again to this world.\n\nMany questions are raised among Indian philosophers on the exact meaning of\ncertain passages occurring in the preceding paragraphs. First, as to who is\nadmitted to the path of the Devas? Householders, who know the secret doctrine\nof the five fires or the five libations of the Agnihotra, as described above,\nwhile other householders, who only perform the ordinary sacrifices, without a\nknowledge of their secret meaning, go by the path of the fathers. Secondly,\nthose who have retired to the forest, and whose worship there consists in\nfaith and austerities, i. e. Vanaprasthas and Parivra _g_ akas, before they\narrive at a knowledge of the true Brahman. The question then arises, whether\nreligious students also enter the path of the Devas? This is affirmed, because\nPura _n_ as and Sm _ri_ tis assert it, or because our text, if properly\nunderstood, does not exclude it. Those, on the contrary, who know not only a\nconditioned, but the highest unconditioned Brahman, do not proceed on the path\nof the Devas, but obtain Brahman immediately.\n\nAgain, there is much difference of opinion whether, after a man p. 83 has been\nin the moon, consuming his works, he can be born again. Birth is the result of\nformer works, and if former works are altogether consumed, there can be no new\nbirth. This, however, is shown to be an erroneous view, because, besides the\ngood sacrificial works, the fruits of which are consumed in the moon, there\nare other works which have to be enjoyed or expiated, as the case may be, in a\nnew existence.\n\nThe great difficulty or danger in the round of transmigration arises when the\nrain has fructified the earth, and passes into herbs and trees, rice, corn,\nand beans. For, first of all, some of the rain does not fructify at once, but\nfalls into rivers and into the sea, to be swallowed up by fishes and sea\nmonsters. Then, only after these have been dissolved in the sea, and after the\nsea water has been attracted by the clouds, the rain falls down again, it may\nbe on desert or stony land. Here it may be swallowed by snakes or deer, and\nthese may be swallowed by other animals, so that the round of existence seems\nendless. Nor is this all. Some rain may dry up, or be absorbed by bodies that\ncannot be eaten. Then, if the rain is absorbed by rice, corn, &c., and this be\neaten, it may be eaten by children or by men who have renounced marriage, and\nthus again lose the chance of a new birth.. Lastly, there is the danger\narising from the nature of the being; in whom the food, such as rice and corn,\nbecomes a new seed, and likewise from the nature of the mother. All these\nchances have to be met before a new birth as a Brahma _n_ a, Kshatriya, or Vai\n_s_ ya can be secured.\n\nAnother curious distinction is here made by _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara in his commentary.\nThere are some, he says, who assume the form of rice, corn, &c., not in their\ndescent from a higher world, as described in the Upanishad, but as a definite\npunishment for certain evil deeds they have committed. These remain in that\nstate till the results of their evil deeds are over, and assume then a new\nbody, according to their work, like caterpillars. With them there is also a\nconsciousness of these states, and the acts which caused them to p. 84 assume\nthis or that body, leave impressions behind, like dreams. This is not the case\nwith those who in their descent from the moon, pass, as we saw, through an\nexistence as rice, corn, &c. They have no consciousness of such existences, at\nleast not in their descent. In their ascent to the moon, they have\nconsciousness, as a man who climbs up a tree knows what he is about. But in\ntheir descent, that consciousness is gone, as it is when a man falls down from\na tree. Otherwise a man, who by his good works had deserved rewards in the\nmoon, would, while corn is being ground, suffer tortures, as if he were in\nhell, and the very object of good works, as taught by the Veda, would be\ndefeated. As we see that a man struck by a hammer can be carried away\nunconscious, so it is in the descent of souls, till they are born again as\nmen, and gain a new start for the attainment of the Highest Brahman.\n\n[83:1](sbe01104.htm#fr_257) Let him despise it. Comm.\n\n[83:2](sbe01104.htm#fr_258) Evidently an old Trish _t_ ubh verse, but\nirregular in the third line. See Manu XI, 54.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 11](sbe01105.htm)\n\n"
