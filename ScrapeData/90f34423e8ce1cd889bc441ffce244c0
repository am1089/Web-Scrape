He who, through excessive greed or carelessness, performs this rite for\nothers, is tainted by sin, and perishes like one who has swallowed poison.\n\n2\\. A Brahma _n_ a who performs this rite for his teacher, his father, his\nmother, or for himself is resplendent like the sun. Therefore this rite may be\nperformed for those (persons).\n\n3\\. Ka (Pra _g_ apati) purified by means of this rite the god with a thousand\neyes (Sahasraksha), Fire, Wind, the Sun, Soma, Yama, and other lords of the\ngods.\n\n4\\. Whatever there is in these three worlds, famed as possessing a holy name,\nBrahma _n_ as and the rest, (all) that was produced by Ka through this rite of\nsanctification.\n\n5\\. This sin-destroying secret of Pra _g_ apati was first produced; thereafter\nthousands of purificatory rites .came into existence. 5\n\n6\\. He who performs those eight Ga _n_ ahomas on the (first) day of the year,\nof a half-year, of a season, or of a fortnight, sanctifies ten ancestors and\nten descendants of his line;\n\n7\\. And, while still on earth, he is known to the\n\np. 332\n\ngods in heaven as a holy man, and (after death) that virtuous man rejoices for\na very long time in heaven like a god.\n\n8\\. If a Brahma _n_ a is unable to offer those eight Ga _n_ ahomas, let him\noffer one; thereby his guilt is effaced.\n\n9\\. He, also, whose sons or pupils offer those eight Ga _n_ ahomas, is freed\nfrom his sin which is bought off by his having instructed (them).\n\n10\\. Through a desire of removing one's guilt one even may cause (these\noblations) to be offered by men who have been engaged for money, in case\noneself is unable (to do it); a man need not torment himself. 10\n\n11\\. Even among the virtuous a distribution of wealth is made (for the\nsuccess) of holy rites; some-times a man who is free from debt is (thereby)\nfreed from guilt.\n\n12, Liberated according to this rule from the ocean of guilt and debt, he\nconsiders himself pure and able to successfully perform the sacred rites.\n\n13\\. But in the case of that pure mortal who, freed from all sin and debts,\nbegins the sacred rites, they will succeed without any effort.\n\n14\\. Let him daily (study and) teach this holy (rule) of Pra _g_ apati, which\nthe sage has proclaimed, let him remember it or hear it. (By doing that) he is\nfreed from all guilt and will be exalted in Brahman's world.\n\np. 333\n\n15\\. Let him mutter during twelve days those sacred texts through which he\nwishes to accomplish (his desires), eating once (a day) at night boiled rice\nwith clarified butter, with milk, or with sour milk.\n\n16\\. (Let him offer) ten times a burnt oblation and sprinkle clarified butter.\n(That is) the preliminary worship (which must be performed) when one desires\nto accomplish one's objects through those sacred texts.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[331:5](sbe1490.htm#fr_1462) **8**. I.e. those mentioned V, 7, 5.\n\n[332:10](sbe1490.htm#fr_1463) The meaning is that in case a wealthy man is\nunable to bear 'the restraints,' he may hire others to perform the Homas.\nThough the hired performer will be guilty of a serious offence (Sutra 1), the\nperson who causes them to be performed will derive benefit from them.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na VII, Adhyaya 5](sbe1491.htm)\n\n"
