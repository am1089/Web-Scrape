Not that which is inferred, on account of the impossibility of\nconstruction, and on account of activity.\n\nThe Sutras have so far set forth the doctrine that the highest Brahman is the\ncause of the origination and so on of the world, and have refuted the\nobjections raised by others. They now, in order to safeguard their own\nposition, proceed to demolish the positions held by those very adversaries.\nFor otherwise it might happen that some slow-witted persons, unaware of those\nother views resting on mere fallacious arguments, would imagine them possibly\nto be authoritative, and hence might be somewhat shaken in their belief in the\nVedic doctrine. Another pada therefore is begun to the express end of refuting\nthe theories of others. The beginning is made with the theory of Kapila,\nbecause that theory has several features, such as the view of the existence of\nthe effect in the cause, which are approved of by the followers of the Veda,\nand hence is more likely, than others, to give rise to the erroneous view of\nits being the true doctrine. The Sutras I, 1, 5 and ff. have proved only that\nthe Vedic texts do not set forth the Sa _n_ khya view, while the task of the\npresent pada is to demolish that view itself: the Sutras cannot therefore be\ncharged with needless reiteration.\n\nThe outline of the Sa _n_ khya doctrine is as follows. 'There is the\nfundamental Prak _ri_ ti, which is not an effect; there are the seven effects\nof Prak _ri_ ti, viz. the Mahat and so on, and the sixteen effects of those\neffects; and there is the soul, which is neither Prak _ri_ ti nor effect'--\nsuch is the comprehensive statement of the principles. The entity called\n'fundamental Prak _ri_ ti' is constituted by the three\n\np. 481\n\nsubstances called Sattva, Ra _g_ as, and Tamas, (when) in a state of complete\nequipoise, none of the three being either in defect or in excess; the\nessential nature of those three consists respectively in pleasure, pain, and\ndullness; they have for their respective effects lightness and illumination,\nexcitement and mobility, heaviness and obstruction; they are absolutely non-\nperceivable by means of the senses, and to be defined and distinguished\nthrough their effects only. Prak _ri_ ti, consisting in the equipoise of\nSattva, Ra _g_ as, and Tamas is one, itself non-sentient but subserving the\nenjoyment and final release of the many sentient beings, eternal, all-\npervading, ever active, not the effect of anything, but the one general cause.\nThere are seven Principles which are the effects of Prak _ri_ ti and the\ncausal substances of everything else; these seven are the Mahat, the ahankara,\nthe subtle matter (tanmatra) of sound, the subtle matter of touch, the subtle\nmatter of colour, the subtle matter of taste, and the subtle matter of smell.\nThe ahankara is threefold, being either modified (vaikarika), or active (tai\n_g_ asa), or the originator of the elements (bhutadi).\n\nThe vaikarika is of sattva-nature and the originator of the sense--organs; the\nbhutadi is of tamas--nature. and the cause of those subtle matters (tanmatra)\nwhich in their turn are the cause of the gross elements; the tai _g_ asa is of\nthe nature of ragas, and assists the other two. The five gross elements are\nthe ether and so on; the five intellectual senses are hearing and so on; the\nfive organs of action are speech and so on. With the addition of the internal\norgan (manas) these are the sixteen entities which are mere effects.--The\nsoul, not being capable of any change, is not either the causal matter or the\neffect of anything. For the same reason it is without attributes, consisting\nof mere intelligence, eternal, non-active, all-pervading, and different in\neach body. Being incapable of change and non-active, it can neither be an\nagent nor an enjoyer; but although this is so, men in their confusion of mind,\ndue to the closeness to each other of Prak _ri_ ti and the soul, erroneously\nattribute to Prak _ri_ ti the intelligence of the soul, and to the soul the\nactivity of Prak _ri_ ti--just as the redness of the rose\n\np. 482\n\nsuperimposes itself on the crystal near it,--and thus consider the soul to be\nan 'I' and an enjoyer. Fruition thus results from ignorance, and release from\nknowledge of the truth. This their theory the Sa _n_ khyas prove by means of\nperception, inference, and authoritative tradition. Now with regard to those\nmatters which are proved by perception, we Vedantins have no very special\nreason for dissenting from the Sa _n_ khyas; and what they say about their\nauthoritative tradition, claiming to be founded on the knowledge of all-\nknowing persons such as Kapila, has been pretty well disproved by us in the\nfirst adhyaya. If, now, we further manage to refute the inference which leads\nthem to assume the Pradhana as the cause of the--world, we shall have\ndisestablished their whole theory. We therefore proceed to give this\nrefutation.\n\nOn this point the Sa _n_ khyas reason as follows. It must necessarily be\nadmitted that the entire world has one cause only; for if effects were assumed\nto originate from several causes we should never arrive at an ultimate cause.\nAssume that parts such as e.g. threads produce a whole (i.e. in the case of\nthreads, a piece of cloth) in the way of their being joined together by means\nof their six sides, which are parts of the threads. You must then further\nassume that the threads themselves are in the same way produced by their\nparts, having a similar constitution. And these parts again by their parts,\nuntil you reach the atoms; these also must be assumed to produce their\nimmediate effects by being joined together with their six sides, for otherwise\nsolid extension (prathiman) could not be brought about. And then the atoms\nalso as being wholes, consisting of parts 1, must be viewed as produced by\ntheir parts, and these again by their parts and so on, so that we never arrive\nat an ultimate cause. In order therefore to establish such an ultimate cause\nwe must have recourse to the hypothesis of the general cause being constituted\nby one substance, which possesses the power of transforming itself in various\ndifferent ways, without at the\n\np. 483\n\nsame time forfeiting its own essential nature, and which forms the general\nsubstrate for an infinity of different effects, from the Mahat downwards. This\none general cause is the Pradhana constituted by the equipoise of the three gu\n_n_ as. The reasons for the assumption of this Pradhana are as follows:--'On\naccount of the limitedness of particular things; of connexion (anvaya); of\nactivity proceeding from special power; and of the difference and non-\ndifference of cause and effect--the Non-evolved (Pradhana) is the general\ncause of this many-natured Universe' (vai _s_ varupya) (Sa _n_ khya Ka. I, 15;\n16).--The term 'vai _s_ varupya' denotes that which possesses all forms, i.e.\nthe entire world with its variously constituted parts--bodies, worlds, and so\non. This world, which on account of its variegated constitution must be held\nto be an effect, has for its cause the Unevolved (avyakta = Prak _ri_ ti),\nwhich is of the same nature as the world. Why so? Because it is an effect; for\nwe perceive that every effect is different from its special cause--which has\nthe same nature as the effect--and at the same time is non-different. Such\neffected things as e.g. a jar and a gold ornament are different from their\ncauses, i.e. clay and gold, which have the same nature as the effects, and at\nthe same time non-different. Hence the manifold-natured world originates from\nthe Pradhana which has the same nature, and is again merged in it: the world\nthus has the Pradhana alone for its cause. This Pradhana is constituted by the\nequipoise of the three gu _n_ as, and thus is a cause possessing a nature\nequal to that of its effect, i.e. the world; for the world is of the nature of\npleasure, pain, and dullness, which consist of sattva, ra _g_ as, and tamas\nrespectively. The case is analogous to that of a jar consisting of clay; of\nthat also the cause is none other than the substance clay. For in every case\nobservation shows that only such causal substances as are of the same nature\nas the effects possess that power which is called the origination of the\neffect. That the general cause can be found only in the unevolved Pradhana,\nwhich consists of the three gu _n_ as in a state of equipoise and is unlimited\nwith regard to space as well as time, follows from the limitedness of the\nparticular\n\np. 484\n\nthings, viz. the Mahat, the ahankara, and so on. These latter things are\nlimited like jars and so on, and hence incapable of originating the entire\nworld. Hence it follows that this world, consisting of the three gu _n_ as,\nhas for its only cause the Pradhana, which is constituted by those three gu\n_n_ as in a state of equipoise.\n\nAgainst this argumentation the Sutra says, 'Not that which is inferred, on\naccount of the impossibility of construction, and on account of\nactivity.'--'Inference' means 'that which is inferred,' i.e. the Pradhana. The\nPradhana postulated by you is not capable of constructing this manifold-\nnatured world, because while itself being non-intelligent it is not guided by\nan intelligent being understanding its nature. Whatever is of this latter kind\nis incapable of producing effects; as e.g. wood and the like by themselves are\nnot capable of constructing a palace or a carriage. As it is matter of\nobservation that non-intelligent wood, not guided by an intelligent agent\nunderstanding its nature, cannot produce effects; and as it is observed that\nif guided by such an agent matter does enter on action so as to produce\neffects; the Pradhana, which is not ruled by an intelligent agent, cannot be\nthe general cause. The 'and' in the Sutra is meant to add as a further\nargument that 'presence' (anvaya) has no proving force. For whiteness present\nin cows and so on is not invariably accompanied by the quality of being the\ncause of the class characteristics of cows. Nor must it be said that qualities\nsuch as whiteness, although present in the effect, may not indeed be causes,\nbut that substances such as gold and the like which are present in certain\neffects are invariably accompanied by the quality of being causes, and that\nhence also the substances called sattva, ra _g_ as, and tamas, which are found\npresent in all effects, are proved to be the causes of all those effects. For\nsattva and so on are attributes of substances, but not themselves substances.\nSattva and so on are the causes of the lightness, light, &c.. belonging to\nsubstances such as earth and the like, and hence distinctive attributes of the\nessential nature of those substances, but they are not observed to be present\nin any effects in\n\np. 485\n\na substantial form, as clay, gold, and other substances are. It is for this\nreason that they are known as 'gu _n_ as.' You have further said that the\nworld's having one cause only must be postulated in order that an ultimate\ncause may be reached. But as the sattva, ra _g_ as, and tamas are not one but\nthree, you yourself do not assume one cause, and hence do not manage to arrive\nat an ultimate cause. For your Pradhana consists in the equipoise of the three\ngu _n_ as; there are thus several causes, and you have no more an ultimate\ncause than others. Nor can you say that this end is accomplished through the\nthree gu _n_ as being unlimited. For if the three gu _n_ as are all alike\nunlimited, and therefore omnipresent, there is nowhere a plus or minus of any\nof them, and as thus no inequality can result, effects cannot originate. In\norder to explain the origination of results it is therefore necessary to\nassume limitation of the gu _n_ as.\n\nNor is our view confirmed by those cases only in which it is clearly perceived\nthat matter produces effects only when guided by an intelligent principle;\nother cases also (where the fact is not perceived with equal clearness) are in\nfavour of our view. This the next Sutra declares.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[482:1](sbe48206.htm#fr_38) As follows from their having six sides.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 2.
