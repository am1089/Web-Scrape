There is non-establishment of pratisankhya\n\np. 505\n\nand apratisa _n_ khya destruction, on account of non-interruption.\n\nSo far the hypothesis of origination from that which is not has been refuted.\nThe present Sutra now goes on to declare that also the absolute (niranvaya)\ndestruction of that which is cannot rationally be demonstrated. Those who\nmaintain the momentariness of all things teach that there are two kinds of\ndestruction, one of a gross kind, which consists in the termination of a\nseries of similar momentary existences, and is capable of being perceived as\nimmediately resulting from agencies such as the blow of a hammer (breaking a\njar, e.g.); and the other of a subtle kind, not capable of being perceived,\nand taking place in a series of similar momentary existences at every moment.\nThe former is called pratisa _n_ khya-destruction; the latter apratisa _n_\nkhya-destruction.--Both these kinds of destruction are not possible.--Why?--On\naccount of the non-interruption, i.e. on account of the impossibility of the\ncomplete destruction of that which is. The impossibility of such destruction\nwas proved by us under II, 1, 14, where we showed that origination and\ndestruction mean only the assumption of new states on the part of one and the\nsame permanent substance, and therefrom proved the non-difference of the\neffect from the cause.--Here it may possibly be objected that as we see that a\nlight when extinguished passes away absolutely, such absolute destruction may\nbe inferred in other cases also. But against this we point out that in the\ncase of a vessel of clay being smashed we perceive that the material, i.e.\nclay, continues to exist, and that therefrom destruction is ascertained to be\nnothing else but the passing over of a real substance into another state. The\npioper assumption, therefore, is that the extinguished light also has passed\nover into a different state, and that in that state it is no longer\nperceptible may be explained by that state being an extremely subtle one.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 22.
