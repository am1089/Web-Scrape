Documents and witnesses are the two kinds of\nevidence for each of the four elements, which have to be distinguished in the\nlaw of debt, viz. the principal, the interest, the surety, and the pledge. A.\n\n[70:118](sbe3315.htm#fr_213) A surety for appearance is where the debtor\ndenies the debt, and is asked to prove his denial in a court. In that case, he\nmust produce a man, who becomes surety for the debtor's appearance at the time\nof the trial. A surety for payment is where the creditor, anxious to obtain a\nloan, produces one or several sureties, who are either jointly or severally\nbound. A surety for honesty is where the debtor denies having received a\ncertain sum, or declares that he has restored it to the creditor, and is\nrequired thereupon to produce a surety for his veracity. A. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya\nII, 53; Vish _n_ u VI, 41.\n\n[70:119](sbe3315.htm#fr_214) This paragraph is intended to show that the\nsurety for appearance and the surety for honesty are equally responsible as\nthe p. 71 surety for payment. A. Manu VIII, 158-160; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II,\n53; Vish _n_ u VI, 41.\n\n[71:120](sbe3315.htm#fr_215) Where a number of sureties have promised each to\npay a certain stipulated share of the debt, in case of the debtor's inability\nto discharge it himself, the liability of each surety does not extend beyond\nwhat has been promised by him. Where, however, all the sureties have declared\ntheir joint liability for the whole debt, the creditor may enforce payment\nfrom any one among them whom he thinks able to satisfy his demand. A. Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 55; Vish _n_ u VI, 42.\n\n[71:121](sbe3315.htm#fr_216) When, however, the surety, anxious to obtain\ntwice the amount of the sum for which he has given security, should pay the\nsum to the creditor of his own accord, without being pressed to do so by the\ncreditor, the debtor shall pay that sum only to him, and not the double sum.\nA. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 56; Vish _n_ u VI, 43.\n\n[71:122](sbe3315.htm#fr_217) Identical with Manu VIII, 49. According to\nAsahaya, four out of the five modes of recovery of a debt are equivalent to\nthe traditional four means of obtaining success, viz. conciliation, division\n(bheda), presents, and violence. Thus, 'the mode consonant with religion'\nmeans conciliation, i.e. gentle remonstrances. If these should prove of no\navail, 'legal proceedings,' or 'division' (bheda), shall be resorted to, i.e.\nthe debtor shall be threatened with a plaint in a court of justice. After\nthat, 'presents' or 'fraud' should be adhibited, i.e. a false hope of\nfictitious gain shall be held out to the debtor. If this mode also should\nprove unsuccessful, 'force' or 'violence' p. 72 may be used, by fettering the\ndebtor, or confining him, &c. The fifth mode, called the customary mode (a _k_\narita), consists of fasting. If the creditor himself, or his son, or his\nservant, takes to fasting it is no offence; or he may confine his own son or\nthreaten to kill him, or seize the property of a stranger, as a compensation.\nThe commentators of the Code of Manu explain the five modes of recovery of a\ndebt much in the same way as Asahaya. 'Fraud,' according to them, is when the\ncreditor borrows money from the debtor under false pretences, or retains a\ndeposit belonging to him. Vyavahara, generally interpreted by 'legal\nproceedings,' means, according to Medhatithi, engaging the debtor in\nagriculture, trade, or other work, and 'taking the proceeds of his labour.'\nThe 'customary mode' (a _k_ arita) is variously explained as denoting\n'fasting,' or 'killing' or 'taking (one's own or the debtor's) family and\ncattle.' Under the former interpretation, it is identical with the well-known\n'sitting in Dharna.' See the translations of Manu, and Jolly, Ind.\nSchuldrecht, \xc2\xa7 7\\. For an interesting parallel to the custom of Dharna from\nthe Brehon Laws of Ancient Ireland, see Sir H. Maine's Early History of\nInstitutions, p. 297 foll.\n\n[72:123](sbe3315.htm#fr_218) A dishonest debtor who applies to the king for\nprotection against a creditor enforcing his demand shall not be abetted by the\nking. 'For secular reasons,' i.e. in order not to disturb the established\norder of society. 'For religious reasons,' i.e. in order not to offend against\nreligious law. A. Nearly identical with Manu VIII, 50. Vish _n_ u VI, 19; Ya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 40.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 9. Pledges](sbe3316.htm)\n\n"
