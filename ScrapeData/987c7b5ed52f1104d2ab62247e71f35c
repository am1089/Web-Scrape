Balaram, Rakhal, and\nother devotees and visitors were seated on a mat spread out on the floor of\nthe room. They were singing hymns to the accompaniment of musical\n[instruments](errata.htm#4). One of the songs had particular reference to the\nsix Lotuses marking the different stages of the Yogi\'s progress toward union\nwith the Universal Spirit. At the close of this song the Bhagavan said:\n\nThe six Lotuses mentioned in the Science of Yoga correspond to the seven\nmental planes mentioned in the Vedanta. When the mind is\n\np. 290\n\nSeven mental Planes.immersed in worldliness, it makes its abode in the lowest\nlotus at the end of the spine. Sexual desires rise when the mind is in the\nsecond lotus, the sexual organ. When it is in the third, the navel, the man is\ntaken up with things of the world--eating, drinking, begetting children. In\nthe fourth mental plane the heart of the man is blessed with the Vision of\nDivine Glory and he cries out: "What is all this! What is all this!" In the\nfifth plane the mind rests in the throat. The devotee talks only on subjects\nrelated to God and grows impatient if any other subject comes up in the course\nof conversation. In the sixth plane the mind is localized between the\neyebrows. The devotee comes face to face with God; only a thin glass-like\npartition, so to speak, keeps him separate from the Divine Person. To him God\nis like a light within a lantern, or like a photograph behind a glass frame.\nHe tries to touch the Vision, but he cannot. His perception falls short of\ncomplete realization, for there is the element of self-consciousness, the\nsense of "I," kept to a certain extent. In the last or seventh plane it is\nperfect Samadhi. Then all sense-consciousness ceases and absolute God-\nconsciousness takes its place. In this state the life\n\np. 291\n\nof the saint lingers for twenty-one days, after which he passes away. During\nthese days he ceases to take any food. Milk, if poured into his mouth, runs\nout and never gets into the stomach.\n\nSages who have reached the seventh Plane.The Bhagavan continued: Some sages,\nwho have reached the seventh or highest plane and have thus attained to God-\nconsciousness, are pleased to come down from that spiritual height for the\ngood of mankind. They keep the ego of Vidya, or, in other words, the Higher\nSelf. But this ego is a mere appearance. It is like a line drawn across a\nsheet of water. Hanuman was blessed with the vision of God both with form and\nwithout form; but he retained the ego of a servant of God. Such was also the\ncase with the wise men Narada, * Sanaka, \xe2\x80\xa0 Sananda, and Sanat Kumara of\nancient times.\n\nHere the question was asked whether Narada and others were Bhaktas only and\nnot Jnanis. The Bhagavan replied: Narada and others had attained the highest\nknowledge (Brahma-Jnana), but still they went on like the murmuring\n\np. 292\n\nwaters of the rivulet, talking and singing. This shows that they too kept this\nego of knowledge. They were Jnanis (knowers), but they talked and sang the\npraises of the Personal God for the good of others. A steamboat not only\nreaches its destination itself but also carries numbers of people on board to\nthe same place. Preceptors such as Narada are like steamboats.\n\nAvataras.The Avataras or Incarnations of God are born with Divine powers and\nDivine qualities. They can go anywhere and can stay in any state of existence\nfrom the highest to the lowest. They can stand on the top of the house and\ncome down by the stairs to the ground floor and can go back to the roof again.\nThey possess the power both to come down and to return. In a seven-story\npalace a stranger can only go to the outer quarters, but the king\'s own child,\nthe prince of the house, is free to go to every corner.\n\nAvataras and ordinary Jivas.As in fireworks there is a kind of flower-pot\nwhich sends off one kind of flower for a while, then another kind and still\nanother, possessing, as it were, an innumerable variety of flowers, so are the\nAvataras. Then there is another kind of flower-pot\n\np. 293\n\nSouls eternally freewhich when lighted burns a little and then goes off all at\nonce. Similarly ordinary Jivas, after long practice and devotional exercises,\ngo up at once in Samadhi and do not return. There is another class who may be\ncalled eternally free. From their birth they seek after God and do not care\nfor anything of the world. We are told of a fabled species of birds called\n"Homa," which live so high up in the heavens, and so dearly love those\nregions, that they never condescend to come down to the earth. Even their\neggs, which when laid in the sky begin to fall to the earth by the force of\ngravity, are said to be hatched during their downward course, and the\nfledglings, finding that they are falling down, at once change their course\nand begin to fly upward towards their home, drawn thither by instinct. Men\nsuch as Sukadeva, Narada, Jesus, Sankaracharya and others are like those\nbirds, who even in their boyhood give up all attachment to the things of this\nworld and betake themselves to the highest regions of true knowledge and\nDivine Light. Those who come with the Avataras are either souls who are\neternally free or who are born for the last time.\n\nThe holy men (Paramahamsas) may be divided\n\np. 294\n\nTwo classes of Paranahamsas.into two classes. First, those who declare the\nSupreme Being to be the Formless One. Trailanga Swami of Benares belonged to\nthis class. Generally speaking, holy men of this class are comparatively\nselfish, because they care only for the liberation of their own souls. Those\nof the second class say that God is with form as well as formless, and that He\nmanifests Himself to His devotees as a Being with form. Have you ever seen a\ncanal running over into the water of the river with which it is connected? The\ncanal has sometimes no trace left, being entirely one with the river-water.\nBut very often there may be noticed a slight movement in the water which\nproves its separateness from the river. Pretty much the same is the case with\nthe Paramahamsa belonging to the second class. His soul becomes one with the\nUniversal Spirit. Ego of knowledge.Still the ego of knowledge (Vidya) or a\nslight trace of individuality is kept to mark his separate existence from the\nDeity.\n\nAgain, such a holy man may be compared to a jar or pitcher of water. A pitcher\nfilled with water to the brim gives sound, only when a portion of the water is\npoured out into another\n\np. 295\n\nvessel. Similarly the Paramahamsa keeps silent except when his water of wisdom\nis poured out into the soul of the disciple. Thus he retains the ego of\nknowledge for the purpose of teaching others.\n\nAgain, suppose a person digs a well. He is thirsty and drinks of the water of\nthat well. Yet when his thirst is quenched it is not unusual for such a person\nto keep the digging implements,--the hack, the shovel, the spade,--for the\nsake of others who may want them for the same purpose. In the same way a\nParamahamsa of the second class, who may have drunk of the waters of\nEverlasting Life and have thus quenched his spiritual thirst, is often anxious\nto do good to mankind. With this in view he retains the ego of Knowledge, the\nego of Love, and the ego of the Preceptor.\n\nHelping others.Some persons eat mangoes and then remove all traces of eating\nby wiping the mouth with a napkin. They care only for their own pleasure. But\nthere are others who let people know that they have eaten mangoes and are\nwilling to share their pleasure with them. Similarly there are Jnanis who\nenjoy Divine Communion, and do not think of speaking about it to others; but\nit was different with\n\np. 296\n\nthe Gopis of Vrindavan. They not only enjoyed communion with Krishna, the God\nIncarnate, but were willing to share their happiness with others.\n\nDivine communion.Communion with God may be compared to the process of\ninvolution. When one communes with the Supreme Being one\'s personality becomes\nabsolutely united with the Divine Personality. This is the state of Samadhi.\nThen, again, when one returns to the human plane and comes back to the\nstarting-point one sees that the world and the ego or self are evolved from\nthe same Supreme Being; and that God, man and nature are interrelated, so that\nif you hold on to one of them you realize the others.\n\nFire of Bhakti destroys sins.Call with Bhakti (love) upon His Hallowed Name\nand the mountain of your sins shall disappear as a mountain of cotton-wool\nwill vanish in an instant if it catches one spark of fire. Worship through\nfear of hell-fire is intended for beginners.\n\nThen turning to some of the company present who were singing, the Bhagavan\nsaid: "Will you sing songs which describe the enjoyment that is realized by\nthe human soul after God-Vision? Rakhal (Swami Brahmananda, one of\n\np. 297\n\n[paragraph continues] His young disciples), do you remember the song sung the\nother day at Nobin Neogi\'s house, \'Be intoxicated with the joy of the Lord\'?"\n\nOne of the company then said: Revered Sir, may we be favored with a song from\nThee?\n\nBhagavan: What shall I sing? I sing pretty much like yourselves. Very well;\nwhen the time comes, I will sing. So saying, He remained silent for a while.\n\nThe first song that He then sang was about Sri Chaitanya Deva and Sri Krishna,\nthat is, from the point of view of the Vaishnavas (dualistic Bhaktas). The\nlast was regarding the Divine Mother.\n\nSong\n\nThe Devotee and Her Ecstatic Love\n\n1\\. The waves of the Divine Love come dashing against my body. The swell of\nthe Sea of Love causes the fall of the unrighteous; nay, it drowns the whole\nuniverse.\n\n2\\. I think of diving deep near the bottom of the Sea, but the alligator of\necstasy has swallowed me up. Who is there to feel for me and, holding me by\nthe hand, drag me out of the water?\n\np. 298\n\nSong\n\nThe Mother of the Universe, and the Machine of the Human Body\n\n1\\. What a fine machine of the human body hath the Divine Mother made!  \nHow wonderful are the sports She is playing through the machine only six feet\nlong!\n\n2\\. Dwelling within the machine, She holds in Her hand the string that sets it\nin motion; but the machine thinks: "I move by my own will," not knowing Who\ncauses it to move.\n\n3\\. The "machine" that has realized Her will not have to be born again. She\nHerself is tied in some machines by the string of Bhakti (love).\n\nii\n\nAt the end of the song the Bhagavan was in Samadhi. His eyes were fixed and\nhalf-closed. His pulse and the heart-beat were suspended. Sense-consciousness\nhad left Him, giving place to pure God-consciousness. Returning a little to\nthe semiconscious state He talked to the Holy Mother, saying: Do not trouble,\nO Mother!\n\np. 299\n\n[paragraph continues] Come down to this plane. Be still, O Mother! What Thou\nwishest, O Mother, for everybody shall come to pass! What shall I say to these\npeople?\n\nDiscrimination and renunciation. Nothing can be achieved in the path of\nspirituality without discrimination (between the Real and the unreal) and\nrenunciation (non-attachment to riches, honor, sensual pleasures).\nRenunciation is of many kinds. One kind springs from the acute pain due to\nworldly misery. But the better kind of renunciation arises from the\nrealization that all worldly blessings are unreal even when they are within\nreach. Thus, having all, the man renounces everything for the sake of God.\n\nTime necessary for religious awakening.Everything rests upon time. For all\nreligious awakening we must wait. But in the meanwhile the precepts of a Guru,\nthe spiritual teacher, should be carefully followed, for the impression of\nthese precepts in the mind of a worldly man may be of great help in time of\nneed. Another reason is that constant hearing of those precepts may gradually\nremove the evil effects of worldly attachment. As the effects of drunkenness\ncan be removed by making the drunkard\n\np. 300\n\nWorldly attachment and realization.drink rice-water, so the intoxication of\nthe worldly-minded people can be cured by the constant hearing of the precepts\nof a holy Guru. The number of those who attain Divine Wisdom is very limited.\nSo the Gita says: "Among thousands a few only strive for the realization of\nGod, and among thousands of such seekers after Truth a few succeed in reaching\nthe goal." The more a person is attached to the as world, the less is he\nlikely to attain Divine Wisdom. The less his attachment is, the more is the\nprobability of his getting it. Thus; wisdom may be said to vary directly as\nnon-attachment to the world, its pleasures, its riches, and inversely as\nattachment to the world.\n\nStages of spirituality.There are different stages of spirituality. First,\nthere is the state of being struck speechless at the thought or realization of\nthe Absolute Brahman,--Existence, Knowledge and Bliss. This is the utmost\npoint as regards love of God that can be reached by ordinary mortals. Second,\nthere is the state of ecstatic love. This is attainable only by a few. They\nare human beings with extraordinary, original powers and entrusted with a\nDivine commission. Being heirs of Divine powers and\n\np. 301\n\nglories, they form a class of their own. To this class belong the Incarnations\nof God like Christ, Krishna, Buddha, and Chaitanya and their devotees of the\nhighest order.\n\nEcstatic love.The two characteristics of ecstatic love are, first, the\nforgetfulness of the external world, and second, the forgetfulness of one\'s\nown body which is so dear to one. The first is like the unripe mango, the\nsecond is like the ripe mango. Ecstatic love of God is like a string in the\nhands of the Bhakta which binds God. The devotee holds the Lord under his\ncontrol, so to speak. The Lord must come to him whenever he calls out to Him.\nIn Persian books it is written that within the flesh are the bones, within the\nbones is the marrow, within the marrow, the last and innermost of all, is this\necstatic love. Sri Krishna is called " _Tribhanga_ ," that is, the usual\nposture of His body is bent in three different angles. Now a soft substance\nalone can take such an angular shape, so this form of Sri Krishna implies that\nHis whole being must have been made very tender by this ecstatic love.\n\nChaitanya Deva was the incarnation of Divine Love or Bhakti. He came to teach\nmankind true Bhakti. He used to have three states of\n\np. 302\n\nThree states of consciousness in ecstasy.consciousness in ecstasy. First,\nconsciousness of the gross and subtle body. At this time he would repeat the\nName of the Lord and sing His praises in Sankirtan. Second, consciousness of\nthe causal body alone. In this state he would become intoxicated with ecstatic\njoy, and retaining partial consciousness of the external, he would dance in\ncompany with other Bhaktas. Third, consciousness of the Absolute. In this\nstate he would enter into the highest realm of Samadhi, and rising above all\nsense-consciousness, his body would remain apparently lifeless. These states\ncorrespond to the five sheaths of the soul in Vedanta. According to Vedanta\nthe gross body includes the material form which is the outermost sheath and\nthe sheath of Prana or the sense-organs and sense-powers. The subtle body\nincludes two sheaths, mental and intellectual. The causal body is the sheath\nof joyfulness. Beyond these five is the true Self, the Absolute. When the mind\nreaches this state, the highest. Samadhi or God-consciousness is the result.\n\nHow to pray is the next question. Let us not pray for things of this world,\nbut pray like Narada. Narada said to Rama Chandra: "O\n\np. 303\n\n[paragraph continues] How to pray.Rama, grant that I may be favored with\nBhakti, love, devotion and self-surrender to the Lotus of Thy feet." "Be it\nso," said Rama. "But wilt thou not ask for anything else?" Narada replied:\n"Lord, may it please Thee to grant that I may not be attracted by Thy Maya,\nwhich fascinates the creatures of this world." Rama Chandra said once more:\n"Be it so, Narada; but wilt thou not ask for something else?" Narada replied:\n"No, Lord, that is all I pray for."\n\nDegrees of knowledge.Jnana (knowledge) varies in degree and kind. There is\nfirst the knowledge belonging to men of the world--ordinary mortals. This\nknowledge is not sufficiently powerful. It may be compared to the light of a\nlamp which illumines only the inside of a room. The knowledge of a Bhakta\n(devotee) is a stronger light and may be compared to the light of the moon\nwhich causes to be visible things outside the room as well as those inside of\nit. But the Jnana of an Incarnation of God is still more powerful and it thus\nmay be likened to a yet stronger light,--the resplendent glory of the sun.\nSuch light is the illuminator of the moon as well as of the whole world.\nNothing is problematic. to the Divine Incarnation (Avatara). He\n\np. 304\n\nsolves the most difficult problems of life and soul as the simplest things in\nthe world. His exposition of the most intricate questions in which humanity is\ninterested is such as a child can follow. He is the sun of Divine Knowledge\nwhose light dispels the accumulated ignorance of ages.\n\nSpiritual knowledge and the worldly.So long as the man is immersed in\nworldliness he cannot attain to Knowledge Divine and cannot see God. Does\nmuddy water ever reflect the sun or any surrounding object? Spiritual\nknowledge is occasionally visible in worldly people, but very seldom. It does\nnot last long. It is like the light of a lamp. No, no, it is like a ray of the\nsun--as if a ray were coming through a very small hole in the wall. Worldly\npeople repeat the Holy Name of the Lord, but there is no longing in the heart.\nThey have no persistence. Whether they attain or not, they do not care. They\nare bound by Karma and must reap the results of their works. Is there no\nremedy for this state, no hope for the worldly man? Yes, there is. Drop a\npurifying agent, say a piece of alum, into muddy water; the water is purified\nand the impurities settle down at the bottom of the vessel. Discrimination of\n\np. 305\n\nthe Real from the unreal phenomenal universe and non-attachment to the world\nare the two purifying agents. Thus it is that the worldly man ceases to be\nworldly and becomes pure.\n\nWorldly people have the knowledge of diversity, which is the same as\nignorance. But true knowledge makes one realize the unity of existence. "This\nis gold, that is brass" is ignorance, while "all is gold" is true knowledge.\nAll differentiation ceases, when true knowledge comes.\n\nSankara and the Pariah.Sankara * was a great Jnani. He had true Self-\nknowledge; he realized one Brahman everywhere and in all beings. He recognized\nno distinction in caste or creed. At one time, however, he had the\nconsciousness of difference; he would differentiate a pariah from a high-caste\nBrahmin or a sage. He would not touch a pariah after bathing in the sacred\nriver Ganges. One day a pariah was carrying animal flesh along the river bank\nas Sankara was coming from his bath and the pariah ran against him. Sankara\nexclaimed: "Sirrah, how darest thou touch me?" The pariah replied: "Neither\nhast thou touched me\n\np. 306\n\nnor have I touched thee. The \xc3\x82tman is pure: it is neither body nor the\nelements of the body. It is far above the twenty-four categories of the\nuniverse. Thou art the real \xc3\x82tman: so am I. How can I touch thee?" Sankara\nbowed down before the pariah and lo! the pariah trans figured himself into\nShiva, the Lord of wisdom. At that moment Sankara\'s spiritual eyes were open\nand he realized the absolute oneness of the \xc3\x82tman. "I am pure and spotless\n\xc3\x82tman, eternally free": this is the nature of true Self-knowledge.\n\nSpiritual practices.Spiritual practices (Sadhana) are absolutely necessary for\nSelf-knowledge; but if there be perfect faith, then a little practice will be\nenough. One must have faith in the words of the Guru or spiritual master.\nVyasa and the Gopis.Vyasa * was about to cross the river Jamuna. At this\nmoment the Gopis (shepherdesses) arrived. They also wished to go across, but\nthere was no ferry-boat. They asked Vyasa, "Lord, what shall we do?" Vyasa\nreplied: "Do not worry, I will get you across the river; but I am very hungry.\nCan you give me something to eat?" The Gopis had with them a quantity of milk,\ncream and fresh butter.\n\np. 307\n\n[paragraph continues] He consumed them all. The Gopis then asked: "What about\ncrossing the river?" Vyasa stood near the edge of the water and prayed: "O\nJamuna! as I have not eaten anything to-day, by that virtue I ask Thee to\ndivide the waters, so that we can walk across Thy bed and reach the other\nside." No sooner did he utter these words than the waters parted and the dry\nbed was laid bare. The Gopis were amazed. They thought: "How could he say, \'as\nI have not eaten anything to-day,\' when just now he has eaten so much?" They\ndid not see that this was a proof of firm faith; that Vyasa had the faith that\nhe did not eat anything, but that the Lord who dwelt within him was the real\nEater.\n\nStages of spiritual practice.The first stage of spiritual practice is\nassociation with spiritual people, the company of holy men. The second stage\nis faith in things relating to the Spirit. The third stage is single-minded\ndevotion to one\'s Ideal. The Ideal may be one\'s Guru, the spiritual teacher,\nthe Impersonal Brahman, the Personal God or any of His manifestations. The\nfourth stage is the state of being struck speechless at the thought of God.\nThe fifth stage, when the feeling of devotion to God reaches the\n\np. 308\n\nhighest point; it is called Mahabhava. The devotee sometimes laughs, sometimes\nweeps like a madman. He loses all control over his body. This state is not\nattained by ordinary human beings who are not capable of conquering the flesh.\nIt is reached by Incarnations of God who appear in this world for the\nsalvation of mankind. The sixth stage, Prema or ecstatic love, goes hand in\nhand with Mahabhava. It is the most intense love of God and is strictly the\nhighest state of spirituality. The two marks of this stage are the\nforgetfulness of this world and the forgetfulness of self, which includes\none\'s own body.\n\nAfter delivering this sermon, the Bhagavan said to His audience that He would\nbe glad to answer any question. But none was asked, so the Bhagavan continued:\n\nAttainment of knowledge gradual.Knowledge (Jnana) cannot be communicated all\nat once. Its attainment must be gradual Suppose a fever is of a severe type.\nThe doctor would not give quinine under such circumstances. He knows that such\na remedy would do no good. The fever must first leave the patient, which\nrequires time, and then the quinine will take effect. Sometimes the fever will\ngo off without\n\np. 309\n\nthe help of quinine or any other medicine. Precisely the same is the case with\nthe man who seeks for knowledge. To him religious precepts often prove useless\nso long as he is immersed in worldliness. Allow him a certain time for\nenjoyment of the things of the world, then his attachment to the world will\ngradually wear off This is exactly the moment for the success of any religious\ninstructions that may be given to him. Till then all such instructions will be\nentirely thrown away like pearls before swine. Many come to me and I have\nobserved how some of them are anxious to listen to my words. But others of the\ncompany appear to be restless and impatient in my presence. They say to their\nfriends in whispers: "Let us go, let us go. Well, if you wish to stay, we will\ngo to the boat and wait for you there." Spiritual awakening is very much a\nquestion of time. The teacher is a mere help.\n\nThe meeting then broke up.\n\nii\n\nKarma (past actions).Sri Ramakrishna (to a disciple): The fact is, all this\ndesire for knowledge or for freedom depends upon one\'s Karma in one\'s previous\nincarnations.\n\np. 310\n\nDisciple: Yes, Bhagavan, it is so difficult to understand one\'s self. We see\nthe self only as it appears to us. Behind it there may be a hundred previous\nincarnations. We walk upon the floor of a house but we never stop to see how\nit is made and what various things are beneath it.\n\nThe Bhagavan smiled at the disciple and left His seat. He went out into the\nveranda next to the western door of His room and for a time looked on the sun\nwhich was sinking rapidly towards the horizon. Then He gazed down upon the\nholy waters of the sacred stream before Him. A disciple was walking alone in\nfront of the Temple on the embankment of the Ganges. He was watching Balaram\nand others getting into a boat to return to Calcutta. It being midsummer, the\nsacred waters of the river were broken into waves. The day was drawing to its\nclose, it was past five, the sky was cloudy and the clouds presented a most\nwonderful sight, especially towards the north. In the foreground were the\nPanchavati, backed by a line of tall willow trees, with the silver stream\nflowing past on their right. In the background were the beautiful dark blue\nclouds and the dark stream beneath.\n\np. 311\n\nThe disciple was looking on this charming scene. Suddenly his attention was\narrested by the Bhagavan coming from the south in the direction of the\nPanchavati and the willow trees. As Sri Ramakrishna, smiling like a child of\nfive, came up, the beautiful picture seemed to be more than complete. There\nwas the universe on the one hand, and on the other the One Soul who reflected\nthe universe and saw it in its real nature. Yes, the disciple felt that in\nthat Presence he was as near the solution of the problem of life as he could\nbe. It was this Presence that made everything--the images of gods and\ngoddesses, men, women and children, trees, flowers, leaves, every inch of\nground in that Temple instinct with spirituality and full of the Joy of the\nLord: Yes, he felt truly that it was the God-Man before him that had thrown an\nirresistible charm over everything in that wonderful place--over every object,\ndivine or human, animate or inanimate, seen by the outer or by the inner eye,\nfrom the dust under His Hallowed Feet to those sacred images worshipped in the\nTemple or perceived by looking within that other temple, the body of man, that\nveritable "revelation in the flesh." He felt like one spell-bound in that\nPresence!\n\np. 312\n\niii\n\nIt was evening. After the usual prayers and other religious exercises enjoined\non the pious Hindu were over, there was yet another meeting between the Master\nand the same disciple. The disciple then asked, referring to the apparently\ncontradictory systems of religious faith among the. Hindus: Bhagavan, is this\na contradiction: some among the Hindus hold that Sri Krishna is identical with\nKali, the Divine Mother, while others hold that Sri Krishna is the \xc3\x82tman, the\nAbsolute, and that Radha is Chitsakti, the self-conscious Power that rules the\nuniverse, the Creator, Preserver and Destroyer, the Personal God?\n\nGod is Infinite.Bhagavan: The former view is that of the Devi Puran. Be it so,\nbut there need be no contradiction. God is Infinite. Infinite are the Forms in\nwhich He manifests Himself. Infinite also are the ways leading to Him.\n\nDisciple: Oh, I see! The end in view is to get on the roof of the house. The\nmeans may be various, as Thou hast often said,--a single rope, a bamboo, a\nwooden ladder, or a staircase?\n\nBhagavan: Quite so. That you can understand\n\np. 313\n\nGrace of God.this so quickly is due to the Grace of God. Without His Grace\ndoubt is never cleared up. Our attitude towards God should be like that of\nHanuman who said to Rama Chandra: "Lord, I care not for a special time or\nplace for meditation. What alone I am concerned with is to meditate upon\nThee."\n\nLove of God the one thing needful.Suppose you go into a garden to eat mangoes.\nIs it necessary for you first to count the number trees in the garden, which\nmay be many thousands, then the number of branches, which may be hundreds of\nthousands? Certainly not; you should at once, on the contrary, proceed to eat.\nIn the same way, it is useless to enter into all sorts of discussions and\ncontroversies regarding God, which would only cause a waste of time and\nenergy. One\'s present and most important duty is to love God, to cultivate\nBhakti or devotion.\n\nDisciple:. Bhagavan, I greatly desire that my work in the world should become\na little less than now. The pressure of work stands in the way of one\'s giving\none\'s whole mind to God, does it not?\n\nBhagavan: Oh yes, no doubt that is so; but\n\np. 314\n\na wise man may work _unattached_ and then work will not do any harm to him.\n\nDisciple: But that depends upon the possession of an extraordinary power of\nwill derived from the realization of God. First realization of God, then work\nwithout attachment. Is it not so, Bhagavan?\n\nPower of desire.Sri Ramakrishna: I must say you are right. But the probability\nis, you must have desired these things in your previous incarnations. This\nreminds me of the story narrated in one of the Sacred Books. It is said that\nSri Krishna had made his abode in the heart of Radha: so long there was no\nLila (the life of sport that he lived in Vrindavan). But he felt the desire to\ntake the form of a human being; the consequence of this desire was that he\ncame to Vrindavan. Such is the power of desire. Your duty now is to pray\nwithout ceasing for love of God, so that the bondage of work shall gradually\nfall off.\n\nDisciple: Is it, Bhagavan, the duty of the householder to save against a rainy\nday?\n\nCast all care On God.Bhagavan: Try to follow the precept of _Jadrichch\nalabha_, that is, availing oneself of things that come naturally in one\'s way\nwithout one\'s having to put\n\np. 315\n\nforth any efforts for the attainment of those things. Do not take so much\nthought for things of that kind, such as saving against a rainy day. Cast your\ncares on God. What do you think takes place at the time of my Samadhi?\n\nDisciple: Thy spirit is then in the sixth plane mentioned in the Vedanta. Then\nThou comest down to the fifth plane when Thou beginnest to talk.\n\nBhagavan: I am only a humble instrument in His hands. He is doing all these\nthings. I do not know anything.\n\nDisciple: Because of this wonderful self-abnegation all people are drawn to\nThee. Thou didst say that Maya is attachment to one\'s own relatives and\nfriends, but Daya is love extending to all mankind--even to all God\'s\ncreatures. I do not understand the difference. Is not Daya a feeling which\nmakes a man cling to the world?\n\nBhagavan: Daya is not a bad feeling. On the contrary it is elevating and leads\none God-ward. Do you believe in God with form or without form?\n\nDisciple: I go so far as the attributes. God has attributes. So far I see\nclearly enough. But\n\np. 316\n\nis it not a fact that it is impossible to think of the "Formless" without the\nhelp of a form? In any case, we have to go through forms and symbols.\n\nBhagavan (smiling): You see that I lay stress upon the worship of God with\nform as eminently favorable for the cultivation of devotion.\n\nDisciple: Is Pandit Sasadhar * making any progress in this direction,--in the\nculture of Bhakti or devotion?\n\nBhagavan: Yes; but his tendency is in the direction of the path of knowledge.\nThese men belong to a class of their own. They do not see that this way is\nexceedingly difficult. Renunciation.It is sufficient if one can give up the\nworld in the mind. Outward renunciation is not absolutely necessary.\n\nDisciple: What Thou sayest is, as it seems to me, intended for the weak. For\nmen of the highest class is meant renunciation in the strict sense of the\nword. They must give up the world not only in their mind but also outwardly.\n\np. 317\n\nBhagavan: You have heard all about renunciation as I have taught it.\n\nDisciple: Yes, Bhagavan, I understand by renunciation not only the absence of\nattachment to things of this world. It is non-attachment to things of this\nworld _plus_ something. That something is the love of God.\n\nState of God-vision.Bhagavan: You are right. I am glad that you see this. God-\nvision cannot be made clear to others. The state of things that comes about\nmay, however, be described to a certain extent. You have no doubt been to the\ntheatre to witness a dramatic performance. Before the performance commences,\nyou must have noticed that the people are very busy talking to one another on\na variety of subjects,--politics, household affairs, official business. But no\nsooner does the drop-curtain go up and mountains, cottages, rivers, men are\npresented to view than all noise ceases, all conversation ends and each\nindividual spectator is all attention to the novel scene that is being enacted\nbefore him. Pretty much the same is the state of him who is blessed with God-\nvision.\n\nDisciple: Ecstatic love of God, as Thou hast said this day, is the string with\nwhich to bind\n\np. 318\n\nthe God of love. With such love one may be sure of seeing God. But the\nquestion is whether such love is within the reach of the man of the world\n(Grihastha).\n\nThe Bhagavan remained silent.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[291:*](gork13.htm#fr_80) Narada, see note page [168](gork08.htm#page_168).\n\n[291:\xe2\x80\xa0](gork13.htm#fr_81) Sanaka, Sananda, and Sanat Kumara were the three\nRishis or Seers of Truth in ancient India.\n\n[305:*](gork13.htm#fr_82) Sankara, same as Sankaracharya.
