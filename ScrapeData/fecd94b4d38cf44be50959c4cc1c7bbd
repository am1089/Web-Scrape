(He whose work is this is Brahman), because (the 'work') denotes the\nworld.\n\nIn the Kaushitaki-brahma _n_ a, in the dialogue of Balaki and A _g_ ata _s_\natru, we read, 'O Balaki, he who is the maker of\n\np. 269\n\nthose persons, he of whom this is the work, he alone is to be known' (Kau. Up.\nIV, 19). The question here arises whether what is here inculcated as the\nobject of knowledge is the individual soul or the chief vital air or the\nhighest Self.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that the vital air is meant. For, in the first\nplace, he says, the clause 'of whom this is the work' points to the activity\nof motion, and that activity rests on the vital air. In the second place, we\nmeet with the word 'pra _n_ a' in a complementary passage ('Then he becomes\none with that pra _n_ a alone'), and that word is well known to denote the\nvital air. In the third place, pra _n_ a is the maker of all the persons, the\nperson in the sun, the person in the moon, &c., who in the preceding part of\nthe dialogue had been enumerated by Balaki; for that the sun and the other\ndivinities are mere differentiations of pra _n_ a we know from another\nscriptural passage, viz. 'Who is that one god (in whom all the other gods are\ncontained)? Pra _n_ a and he is Brahman, and they call him That' (B _ri_. Up.\nIII, 9, 9).--Or else, the purvapakshin continues, the passage under discussion\nrepresents the individual soul as the object of knowledge. For of the soul\nalso it can be said that 'this is the work,' if we understand by 'this' all\nmeritorious and non-meritorious actions; and the soul also, in so far as it is\nthe enjoyer, can be viewed as the maker of the persons enumerated in so far as\nthey are instrumental to the soul's fruition. The complementary passage,\nmoreover, contains an inferential mark of the individual soul. For A _g_ ata\n_s_ atru, in order to instruct Balaki about the 'maker of the persons' who had\nbeen proposed as the object of knowledge, calls a sleeping man by various\nnames and convinces Balaki, by the circumstance that the sleeper does not hear\nhis shouts, that the pra _n_ a and so on are not the enjoyers; he thereupon\nwakes the sleeping man by pushing him with his stick, and so makes Balaki\ncomprehend that the being capable of fruition is the individual soul which is\ndistinct from the pra _n_ a. A subsequent passage also contains an inferential\nmark of the individual soul, viz. 'And as the master feeds with his people,\nnay, as his people feed on the master, thus does this conscious Self feed with\n\np. 270\n\nthe other Selfs, thus those Selfs feed on the conscious Self' (Kau. Up. IV,\n20). And as the individual soul is the support of the pra _n_ a, it may itself\nbe called pra _n_ a.--We thus conclude that the passage under discussion\nrefers either to the individual soul or to the chief vital air; but not to the\nLord, of whom it contains no inferential marks whatever.\n\nTo this we make the following reply.--The Lord only can be the maker of the\npersons enumerated, on account of the force of the introductory part of the\nsection. Balaki begins his colloquy with A _g_ ata _s_ atru with the offer,\n'Shall I tell you Brahman?' Thereupon he enumerates some individual souls\nresiding in the sun, the moon, and so on, which participate in the sight of\nthe secondary Brahman, and in the end becomes silent. A _g_ ata _s_ atru then\nsets aside Balaki's doctrine as not referring to the chief Brahman--with the\nwords, 'Vainly did you challenge me, saying, Shall I tell you Brahman,' &c.--\nand proposes the maker of all those individual souls as a new object of\nknowledge. If now that maker also were merely a soul participating in the\nsight of the secondary Brahman, the introductory statement which speaks of\nBrahman would be futile. Hence it follows that the highest Lord himself is\nmeant.--None, moreover, but the highest Lord is capable of being the maker of\nall those persons as he only is absolutely independent.--Further, the clause\n'of whom this is the work' does not refer either to the activity of motion nor\nto meritorious and non-meritorious actions; for neither of those two is the\ntopic of discussion or has been mentioned previously. Nor can the term 'work'\ndenote the enumerated persons, since the latter are mentioned separately--in\nthe clause, 'He who is the maker of those persons'--and as inferential marks\n(viz. the neuter gender and the singular number of the word karman, work)\ncontradict that assumption. Nor, again, can the term 'work' denote either the\nactivity whose object the persons are, or the result of that activity, since\nthose two are already implied in the mention of the agent (in the clause, 'He\nwho is the maker'). Thus there remains no other alternative than to\n\np. 271\n\ntake the pronoun 'this' (in 'He of whom this is the work') as denoting the\nperceptible world and to understand the same world--as that which is made--by\nthe term 'work.'--We may indeed admit that the world also is not the previous\ntopic of discussion and has not been mentioned before; still, as no\nspecification is mentioned, we conclude that the term 'work' has to be\nunderstood in a general sense, and thus denotes what first presents itself to\nthe mind, viz. everything which exists in general. It is, moreover, not true\nthat the world is not the previous topic of discussion; we are rather entitled\nto conclude from the circumstance that the various persons (in the sun, the\nmoon, &c.) which constitute a part of the world had been specially mentioned\nbefore, that the passage in question is concerned with the whole world in\ngeneral. The conjunction 'or' (in 'or he of whom,' &c.) is meant to exclude\nthe idea of limited makership; so that the whole passage has to be interpreted\nas follows, 'He who is the maker of those persons forming a part of the world,\nor rather--to do away with this limitation--he of whom this entire world\nwithout any exception is the work.' The special mention made of the persons\nhaving been created has for its purpose to show that those persons whom Balaki\nhad proclaimed to be Brahman are not Brahman. The passage therefore sets forth\nthe maker of the world in a double aspect, at first as the creator of a\nspecial part of the world and thereupon as the creator of the whole remaining\npart of the world; a way of speaking analogous to such every-day forms of\nexpression as, 'The wandering mendicants are to be fed, and then the Brahma\n_n_ as 1.' And that the maker of the world is the highest Lord is affirmed in\nall Vedanta-texts.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[271:1](sbe34127.htm#fr_246) By the Brahma _n_ as being meant all those Brahma\n_n_ as who are not at the same time wandering mendicants.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4, 17](sbe34128.htm)\n\n"
