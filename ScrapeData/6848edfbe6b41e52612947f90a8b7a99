But the same (soul returns from Brahman); on account of work, remembrance,\ntext, and precept.\n\nHere we have to enquire whether the soul when awaking from the union with\nBrahman is the same which entered into union with Brahman, or another one.--\nThe purvapakshin maintains that there is no fixed rule on that point. For just\nas a drop of water, when poured into a large quantity of water, becomes one\nwith the latter, so that when we again take out a drop it would be hard to\nmanage that it should be the very same drop: thus the sleeping soul, when it\nhas become united with Brahman, is merged in bliss and not able again to rise\nfrom it the same. Hence what actually awakes is either the Lord or some other\nsoul.--To this we reply that the same soul which in the state of sleep entered\ninto bliss again arises from it, not any other. We assert this on the ground\nof work, remembrance, sacred text, and precept; which four reasons we will\ntreat separately. In the first place the person who wakes from sleep must be\nthe same, because it is seen to finish work left unfinished before. Men finish\nin the morning what they had left incomplete on the day before. Now it is not\npossible that one man should proceed to complete work half done by another\nman, because this would imply too much. 1\n\np. 148\n\n[paragraph continues] Hence we conclude that it is one and the same man who\nfinishes on the latter day the work begun on the former.--In the second place\nthe person rising from sleep is the same who went to sleep, for the reason\nthat otherwise he could not remember what he had seen, &c., on the day before;\nfor what one man sees another cannot remember. And if another Self rose from\nsleep, the consciousness of personal identity (atmanusmara _n_ a) expressed in\nthe words, 'I am the same I was before,' would not be possible.--In the third\nplace we understand from Vedic texts that the same person rises again, 'He\nhastens back again as he came, to the place from which he started, to be\nawake' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 16); 'All these creatures go day after day into the\nBrahma-world and yet do not discover it' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 3, 2); 'Whatever\nthese creatures are here, whether a lion, or a wolf, or a boar, or a worm, or\na midge, or a gnat, or a musquito, that they become again and again' ( _Kh_.\nUp. VI, 10, 2). These and similar passages met with in the chapters treating\nof sleeping and waking have a proper sense only if the same soul rises again.\n--In the fourth place we arrive at the same conclusion on the ground of the\ninjunctions of works and knowledge, which, on a different theory, would be\nmeaningless. For if another person did rise, it would follow that a person\nmight obtain final release by sleep merely, and what then, we ask, would be\nthe use of all those works which bear fruit at a later period, and of\nknowledge?--Moreover on the hypothesis of another person rising from sleep,\nthat other person would either be a soul which had up to that time carried on\nits phenomenal life in another body; in that case it would follow that the\npractical existence carried on by means of that body would be cut short. If it\nbe said that the soul which went to sleep may, in its turn, rise in that other\nbody (so that B would rise in A's body and A in B's body), we reply that that\nwould be an altogether useless hypothesis; for what advantage do we derive\nfrom assuming that each soul rises from sleep not in the same body in which it\nhad gone to sleep, but that it goes to sleep in one body and rises in another?\n--Or else the soul rising (in A's body) would be\n\np. 149\n\none which had obtained final release, and that would imply that final release\ncan have an end. But it is impossible that a soul which has once freed itself\nfrom Nescience should again rise (enter into phenomenal life). Hereby it is\nalso shown that the soul which rises cannot be the Lord, who is everlastingly\nfree from Nescience.--Further, on the hypothesis of another soul rising, it\nwould be difficult to escape the conclusion that souls reap the fruits of\ndeeds not their own, and, on the other hand, are not requited for what they\nhave done.--From all this it follows that the person rising from sleep is the\nsame that went to sleep.--Nor is it difficult to refute the analogical\nreasoning that the soul, if once united with Brahman, can no more emerge from\nit than a drop of water can again be taken out from the mass of water into\nwhich it had been poured. We admit the impossibility of taking out the same\ndrop of water, because there is no means of distinguishing it from all the\nother drops. In the case of the soul, however, there are reasons of\ndistinction, viz. the work and the knowledge (of each individual soul). Hence\nthe two cases are not analogous.--Further, we point out that the flamingo,\ne.g. is able to distinguish and separate milk and water when mixed, things\nwhich we men are altogether incapable of distinguishing.--Moreover, what is\ncalled individual soul is not really different from the highest Self, so that\nit might be distinguished from the latter in the same way as a drop of water\nfrom the mass of water; but as we have explained repeatedly, Brahman itself is\non account of its connexion with limiting adjuncts metaphorically called\nindividual soul. Hence the phenomenal existence of one soul lasts as long as\nit continues to be bound by one set of adjuncts, and the phenomenal existence\nof another soul again lasts as long as it continues to be bound by another set\nof adjuncts. Each set of adjuncts continues through the states of sleep as\nwell as of waking; in the former it is like a seed, in the latter like the\nfully developed plant. Hence the proper inference is that the same soul awakes\nfrom sleep.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[147:1](sbe38112.htm#fr_110) There would follow from it, e.g. that in the case\nof sacrifices occupying more than one day, there would be several sacrificers,\nand that consequently it would be doubtful to whom the fruit of the sacrifice,\nas promised by the Veda, belongs. And this would imply a stultification of the\nsacred text.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2, 10](sbe38113.htm)\n\n"
