I will completely explain the purification of those whose guilt has not\nbeen made public, both from great crimes and for minor offences.\n\np. 125\n\n2\\. A penance prescribed in (the section on) secret (penances) is for an\nAgnihotrin, an aged and a learned man, who have subdued their senses; but\nother men (must perform the expiations) described above.\n\n3\\. Those constantly engaged in suppressing their breath, reciting\npurificatory texts, giving gifts, making burnt-oblations, and muttering\n(sacred texts) will, undoubtedly, be freed from (the guilt of) crimes causing\nloss of caste.\n\n4\\. Seated with Ku _s_ a grass in his hands, let him repeatedly suppress his\nbreath, and again and again recite purificatory texts, the Vyah _ri_ tis, the\nsyllable Om, and the daily portion of the Veda 4\n\n5\\. Always intent on the practice of Yoga, let him again and again suppress\nhis breath. Up to the ends of his hair and up to the ends of his nails let him\nperform highest austerity. 5\n\n6\\. Through the obstruction (of the expiration) air is generated, through air\nfire is produced, then through heat water is formed; hence he is internally\npurified by (these) three.\n\n7\\. Neither through severe austerities, nor through the daily recitation of\nthe Veda, nor through offering sacrifices can the twice-born reach that\ncondition which they attain by the practice of Yoga.\n\n8\\. Through the practice of Yoga (true) knowledge is obtained, Yoga is the sum\nof the sacred law, the practice of Yoga is the highest and eternal austerity;\ntherefore let him always be absorbed in the practice of Yoga.\n\np. 126\n\n9\\. For him who is constantly engaged in (reciting the syllable) Om, the seven\nVyah _ri_ tis, and the three-footed Gayatri no danger exists anywhere. 9\n\n10\\. The Vedas likewise begin with the syllable Om, and they end with the\nsyllable Om, the syllable Om is the sum of all speech; therefore let him\nrepeat it constantly. 10\n\n11\\. The most excellent (portion of the) Veda, which consists of one syllable,\nis declared to be the best purificatory text.\n\n12\\. If the guilt of all sins did fall on one man, to repeat the Gayatri ten\nthousand times (would be) an efficient means of purification.\n\n13\\. If, suppressing his breath, he thrice recites the Gayatri together with\nthe Vyah _ri_ tis together with the syllable Om and with the (text called) _S_\niras, that is called one suppression of breath. 13\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[125:4](sbe1428.htm#fr_674) **XXV**. Read pra _n_ ayaman in the text.\n\n[125:5](sbe1428.htm#fr_675) The MSS. read at the end of this verse, tapas\ntapyatam uttamam, while K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita gives tapas tapyat to\nuttamam. The correct reading is probably tapas tapyatu uttamam.\n\n[126:9](sbe1428.htm#fr_676) I read with the MSS. bhaya _m_ for bhave.\n\n[126:10](sbe1428.htm#fr_677) Manu II, 74.\n\n[126:13](sbe1428.htm#fr_678) Identical with Vish _n_ u LV, 9.
