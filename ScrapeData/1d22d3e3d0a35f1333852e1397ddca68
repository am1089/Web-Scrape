Janamejaya said :-- \xc2\x93O Intelligent One! Did the prince Tris\xc2\x92anku free\nhimself afterwards of the curse inflicted on him by the Muni Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n2-8. Vyasa said :-- O King! Satyavrata, cursed by Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha, was\ntransformed into a demoniacal state (Pis\xc2\x92achatva); but he became a great\ndevotee of the Devi and passed away his time in that \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92rama. One day he\nrepeating slowly the nine-lettered Mantram of the Bhagavati, wished to perform\nthe Puras\xc2\x92chara _n_ a ceremony (repeating the name of a deity attended with\nburnt offerings, oblations, etc.) of the said Mantra, came to the Brahmi _n_\ns, bowed down to them with great devotion and purity and said :-- \xc2\x93O venerable\ngods of the earth! Kindly hear me;\n\n\n\np. 630\n\n\n\nI with my head bowed down pray to you, that you all be my priests (Ritt-vigs).\nYou are all versed in the Vedas; so kindly do for me duly the Homa ceremony\nequal to one-tenth part of Japam, for my success. O Brahma _n_ as! My name is\nSatyavrata; I am a prince; you ought to do this work for me for my welfare.\xc2\x94\nThus hearing the prince\xc2\x92s words the Brahma _n_ as said :-- \xc2\x93O Prince! You are\ncursed by your Guru and you are now turned into a demoniacal state. You have\nnow no right to the Vedas; especially you are now in the Pis\xc2\x92acha state; it is\nblamed by all the persons; so now you are not fit to be initiated into the\nceremony.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n9-14. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing them, the prince got very sad and\ndejected and thought \xc2\x93Fie on my life! What shall I do now in living even in\nthe forest. My father has forsaken me; I am banished from the kingdom; again,\nby the Guru\xc2\x92s curse, I have got this Pis\xc2\x92acha state; I therefore can\xc2\x92t decide\nwhat to do.\xc2\x94 The prince, then, collecting fuel, prepared the funeral pile for\nhimself, remembered the Chandika Devi and repeating Her Mantram, resolved to\njump into the fire. Lighting the pyre in front, the prince bathed and\nstanding, with clasped palms, began to chant the hymns to Maha Maya before\nentering into the fire. At this moment, the Devi Bhagavati, knowing that the\nprince was ready to burn himself, came instantly to the spot on the back of\nthe lion, by the aerial route. She manifested Henself before him and spoke in\na voice deep like a rain-cloud.\n\n\n\n15-17. \xc2\x93O Virtuous One What is all this? What have you settled all these?\nNever throw yourself in fire; be patient. O Fortunate One! Your father is now\naged; he will give you his kingdom and will go to the forest for tapasya;\ntherefore, O Hero! Do leave your depression of spirits. O King! Tomorrow the\nministers of your father will came to you to take you there. By My Grace, your\nfather will install you on the throne and, in due time, he will conquer his\ndesires and will go undoubtedly to the Brahma loka.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n18-32. Vyasa said :-- O Fortunate One! Thus saying, the Devi vanished at that\nspot; the prince, too, desisted from his purpose of entering into the fire. In\nthe meanwhile, the highsouled Narada went to Ayodhya and at once informed\neverything to the King. The King became very sad and began to repent very\nmuch, hearing the son\xc2\x92s resolve to burn himself. The virtuous King, grieved at\nheart, for his son, said to his ministers :-- \xc2\x93You all are aware of the\nturning out of my son. I have forsaken my intelligent son Satyavrata; though\nhe was very spiritual and worthy to get the kingdom; yet, at my command, he\n\n\n\np. 631\n\n\n\ninstantaneously went away to the forest. Void of wealth, he, practising\nforgiveness, passed his time in study, particularly in spiritual knowledge;\nbut Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha Deva, cursed him and made him like a Pis\xc2\x92acha. Very much\ndistressed by pain and sorow, he was ready to burn himself but the Maha Devi\npreventing him, he desisted from this purpose. So go hurriedly and, consoling\nmy powerful eldest son, bring him at once to me. I am now calm and quiet and\nof a retiring disposition; so I am determined to practise tapasya. My son is\nnow capable to govern the subjects; I will now install my son on the throne\nand retire to the forest.\xc2\x94 So he gladly sent his ministers to his son. The\nministers, too, gladly went there and consoled the prince and, with respect,\nbrought him to the Ayodhya city. Seeing Satyavrata with matted hair on his\nhead, with dirty clothes, and thin and worn out with cares, the King began to\nthink within himself \xc2\x93Oh! What a cruel act have I done, though I know\neverything about religion, in banishing my intelligent son, quite fit to\ngovern my kingdom.\xc2\x94 Thus thinking, he embraced his son by his arms and\nconsoling him, made him sit by his throne. The King, versed in politics, then\nbegan to speak gladly with suffocated feelings of love to his son sitting by\nthe side of him.\n\n\n\n33-53. O Son! Your highest duty is to keep your mind always on religion and to\nrespect the Brahmi _n_ s. Never speak falsely anywhere nor follow any bad\ncourse in any way. Rather the words of the spiritual good persons ought to be\nfully observed; the ascetics ought to be worshipped. Senses must be controlled\nand the wicked cruel robbers are certainly to be slain. O Son! For one\xc2\x92s\nsuccess, one should consult with one\xc2\x92s ministers and keep that as secret by\nall means. Any enemy howsoever insignificant he may be, a clever King should\nnever overlook him. The ministers, if they be attached to other masters and if\nthey come round afterwards, don\xc2\x92t trust them. Spies should be kept to watch\nfriends and foes alike. Show your living regards to the religion always, and\nmake charitable gifts. One ought not to argue in vain and always avoid the\ncompany of the wicked. O Son! You should worship the Mahar _s_ is and perform\nvarious sacrifices. Never trust women, those who are inordinately addicted to\nwomen, and the gamblers. Never is it advisable to be addicted too much to\nhunting. Always shew your back to gambling, drinking, music and to the\nprostitutes and try to make your subjects follow the same. Early in the\nmorning at the Brahma Muhurta everyday you should get up from your bed and\nbathe and perform other analogous duties. O Son! Be initiated by the Guru in\nthe Devi Mantra, and worship with devotion the Supreme Force, the Bhagavati.\nHuman birth is crowned with success by worshipping Her Lotus Feet, O Son!\n\n\n\np. 632\n\n\n\nHe who performs once the great Puja of the Maha Devi and drinks the Chara _n_\namrita water (water with which Her feet are worshipped) has never to enter\nagain in the womb of his mother; know this as certain. That Maha Devi is all\nthat is seen and She Herself is again the Seer and Witness, of the nature of\nIntelligence. Filled with these ideas, rest fearless like the Universal Soul.\nDo your daily Naimittik (occasional) duties, go to the Brahmi _n_ \xc2\x92s assembly\nand calling on them ask the conclusions of the Dharma S\xc2\x92astras. The Brahmi _n_\ns, versed in the Vedas and Vedantas, are objects of venerations and must be\nworshipped. Give, then, them always according to merits, cows, lands, gold,\netc. Don\xc2\x92t worship any Brahmi _n_ who is illiterate. Don\xc2\x92t give to illiterates\nmore than their belliful wants. O Child! Never trespass Dharma, out of\ncovetousness, and remember always not to insult ever afterwards any Brahma _n_\nas. The Brahmi _n_ s are the cause of the K _s_ attriyas, the more so they are\nthe terrestrial gods; honour them with all your care! In this never flinch\nfrom your duties. Fire comes out of water; the K _s_ attriyas come out of the\nBrahma _n_ as; iron comes out of stones. The powers of these flow everywhere.\nBut if there be any clash between one thing and its source, then that clash\ndies away in the source. Know this as quite certain. The King who wants his\nown welfare and improvement must by gift and humility shew his respect\nespecially to the Brahmi _n_ s. Follow the maxims of morality as dictated in\nthe Dharma S\xc2\x92astras. Amass wealth according to rules of justice and fill the\ntreasury.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Eleventh Chapter of the Seventh Book about the story of\nTris\xc2\x92anku in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 12](bk07ch12.htm)\n\n'
