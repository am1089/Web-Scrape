(Su. 26).--To this we reply that we in no way place ourselves in\nopposition to the statement that Vai _s_ vanara abides within. For the\npassage, 'He knows him as man-like, as abiding within man,' does not by any\nmeans refer to the gastric fire, the latter being neither the general topic of\ndiscussion nor having been mentioned by name before.--What then does it refer\nto?--It refers to that which forms the subject of discussion, viz. that\nsimilarity to man (of the highest Self) which is fancifully found in the\nmembers of man from the upper part of the head down to the chin; the text\ntherefore says, 'He knows him as man-like,\n\np. 150\n\nas abiding within man,' just as we say of a branch that it abides within the\ntree 1.--Or else we may adopt another interpretation and say that after the\nhighest Self has been represented as having the likeness to man as a limiting\ncondition, with regard to nature as well as to man, the passage last quoted\n('He knows him as abiding within man') speaks of the same highest Self as the\nmere witness (sakshin; i.e. as the pure Self, non-related to the limiting\nconditions).--The consideration of the context having thus shown that the\nhighest Self has to be resorted to for the interpretation of the passage, the\nterm 'Vai _s_ vanara' must denote the highest Self in some way or other. The\nword 'Vi _s_ vanara' is to be explained either as 'he who is all and man (i.e.\nthe individual soul),' or 'he to whom souls belong' (in so far as he is their\nmaker or ruler), and thus denotes the highest Self which is the Self of all.\nAnd the form 'Vai _s_ vanara' has the same meaning as 'Vi _s_ vanara,' the\ntaddhita-suffix, by which the former word is derived from the latter, not\nchanging the meaning; just as in the case of rakshasa (derived from rakshas),\nand vayasa (derived from vayas).--The word 'Agni' also may denote the highest\nSelf if we adopt the etymology agni = agra _n_ i, i.e. he who leads in front.\n--As the Garhapatya-fire finally, and as the abode of the oblation to breath\nthe highest Self may be represented because it is the Self of all.\n\nBut, if it is assumed that Vai _s_ vanara denotes the highest Self, how can\nScripture declare that he is measured by a span?--On the explanation of this\ndifficulty we now enter.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[150:1](sbe34065.htm#fr_164) Whereby we mean not that it is inside the tree,\nbut that it forms a part of the tree.--The Vai _s_ vanara Self is identified\nwith the different members of the body, and these members abide within, i.e.\nform parts of the body.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2, 29](sbe34066.htm)\n\n"
