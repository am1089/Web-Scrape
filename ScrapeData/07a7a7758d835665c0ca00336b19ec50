 \nAnd I, as ancient laws ordain,  \nUnfordable must still remain.  \nYet, Raghu's son, my counsel hear:  \nI ne'er for love or hope or fear  \nWill pile my waters in a heap  \nAnd leave a pathway through the deep.  \nStill shall my care for thee provide  \nAn easy passage o'er the tide,  \nAnd like a city's paven street  \nShall be the road beneath thy feet.'  \nHe ceased: and Rama spoke again:  \n'This spell is ne'er invoked in vain.  \nWhere shall the magic shaft, to spend  \nThe fury of its might, descend?'  \n'Shoot,' Ocean cried, 'thine arrow forth  \nWith all its fury to the north.  \nWhere sacred Drumakulya lies,  \nWhose glory with thy glory vies,  \nThere dwells a wild Abhira  1 race,  \nAs vile in act as foul of face,  \nFierce Dasyus  2 who delight in ill,  \nAnd drink my tributary rill.  \nMy soul no longer may endure  \nTheir neighbourhood and touch impure.  \nAt these, O son of Raghu, aim  \nThine arrow with the quenchless flame.'  \n  Swift from the bow, as Rama drew  \nHis cord, the fiery arrow flew.  \nEarth groaned to feel the wound, and sent  \nA rush of water through the rent;  \nAnd famed for ever is the well  \nOf Vrana  3 where the arrow fell.  \nThen every brook and lake beside  \nThroughout the region Rama dried.  \nBut yet he gave a boon to bless  \nAnd fertilize the wilderness:  \nNo fell disease should taint the air,  \nAnd sheep and kine should prosper there:  \nEarth should produce each pleasant root,  \nThe stately trees should bend with fruit;  \nOil, milk, and honey should abound,  \nAnd fragrant herbs should clothe the  \n  ground.  \nThen spake the king of brooks and seas  \nTo Raghu's son in words like these:  \n'Now let a wondrous task be done  \nBy Nala, Vis'vakarma's son.  \n\nWho, born of one of Vanar race,  \nInherits by his father's grace  \nA share of his celestial art.  \nCall Nala to perform his part,  \nAnd he, divinely taught and skilled,  \nA bridge athwart the sea shall build.'  \n  He spoke and vanished Nala, best  \nOf Vanar chiefs, the king addressed:  \n'O'er the deep sea where monsters play  \nA bridge, O Rama, will I lay;  \nFor, sharer of my father's skill,  \nMine is the power and mine the will.  \n'Tis vain to try each gentler art  \nTo bribe and soothe the thankless heart;  \nIn vain on such is mercy spent;  \nIt yields to naught but punishment.  \nThrough fear alone will Ocean now  \nA passage o'er his waves allow.  \nMy mother, ere she bore her son,  \nThis boon from Vis'vakarma won:  \n'O Mandari, thy child shall be  \nIn skill and glory next to me.'  \nBut why unbidden should I fill  \nThine ear with praises of my skill?  \nCommand the Vanar hosts to lay  \nFoundations for the bridge to-day.'  \n   He spoke: and swift at Rama's best  \nUp sprang the Vanars from their rest,  \nThe mandate of the king obeyed  \nAnd sought the forest's mighty shade.  \nUnrooted trees to earth they threw,  \nAnd to the sea the timber drew.  \nThe stately palm was bowed and bent,  \nAs'okas from the ground were rent,  \nAnd towering Sals and light bamboos,  \nAnd trees with flowers of varied hues,  \nWith loveliest creepers wreathed and crowned,  \nShook, reeled, and fell upon the ground.  \nWith mighty engines piles of stone  \nAnd seated hills were overthrown:  \nUnprisoned waters sprang on high,  \nIn rain descending from the sky:  \nAnd ocean with a roar and swell  \nHeaved wildly when the mountains fell.  \nThen the great bridge of wondrous strength  \nWas built, a hundred leagues in length.  \nRocks huge as autumn clouds bound fast  \nWith cordage from the shore were cast,  \nAnd fragments of each riven hill,  \nAnd trees whose flowers adorned them still.  \nWild was the tumult, loud the din  \nAs ponderous rocks went thundering in.  \nEre set of sun, so toiled each crew,  \nTen leagues and four the structure grew;  \nThe labours of the second day  \nGave twenty more of ready way,  \nAnd on the fifth, when sank the sun,  \nThe whole stupendous work was done.  \nO'er the broad way the Vanars sped,  \nNor swayed it with their countless tread.  \n\np. 445  \n\nExultant on the ocean strand  \nVibhishan stood, and, mace in hand,  \nLonged eager for the onward way,  \nAnd chafed impatient at delay.  \nThen thus to Rama trained and tried  \nIn battle King Sugriva cried:  \n'Come, Hauuman's broad back ascend;  \nLet Angad help to Lakshman lend.  \nThese high above the sea shall bear  \nTheir burthen through the ways of air.'  \n   So, with Sugriva, borne o'erhead  \nIkshvaku's sons the legions led.  \nBehind, the Vanar hosts pursued  \nTheir march in endless multitude.  \nSome skimmed the surface of the wave,  \nTo some the air a passage gave.  \nAmid their ceaseless roar the sound  \nOf Ocean's fearful voice was drowned,  \nAs o'er the bridge by Nala planned  \nThey hastened on to Lanka's strand,  \nWhere, by the pleasant brooks, mid trees  \nLoaded with fruit, they took their ease.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[443:1b](ry421.htm#fr_944) The Indus.\n\n[444:1](ry421.htm#fr_945) Cowherds, sprung from a Brahman and a woman of the\nmedical tribe, the modern Ahirs.\n\n[444:2](ry421.htm#fr_946) Barbarians or outcasts.\n\n[444:3](ry421.htm#fr_947) _Vrana_ means wound or rent.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXIII.: The Omens.](ry422.htm)\n\n"
