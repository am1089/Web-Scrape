Narada said :-- By your Grace I have heard everything very sweet like\nnectar, of the origin of things. Now may I ask you which Devi of these five\nPrakritis has been worshipped by what Mantra? and by whom? How has each of\nthem been praised? and by whom? How has the worship of their Murtis (form)\nbecome prevalent in this world? What are the Stotram (hymn of praise), the\nDhyan (meditation) glory and life of these? Also what sort of boon do each of\nthe Devis grant? and to whom? Kindly describe all these in detail.\n\n\n\n4-29. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Child! Durga, the mother of Ga _n_ es'a, Radha,\nLak _s_ mi, Sarasvati and Savitri, these are the five Prakritis sprung\ndirectly from Mula Prakriti. The methods of their worship, wonderful glorious\nacts, excellent stotrams, and their lives, inculcating good to all, and sweet\nlike nectar are all widely written in the Vedas, Pura _n_ as, Tantras and\nother S'astras. So there is no need to describe them here again. Now I am\ndescribing in detail the auspicious character of these that are sprung from\nthe parts and Kalas of the Prakriti. Hear attentively. Kali, Vasundhara,\nGanga, _S_ a _st_ hi, Mangal Cha _nd_ ika, Tulasi, Manasa, Nidra, Svadha,\nSvaha, and Dak _s_ i _n_ a, these are the parts of Prakriti. By and by I will\ndescribe, briefly, the merit-giving characters and pleasant to hear. Along\nwith these I will describe the Karmas of the Jivas, and the great exalted\nlives of Durga and Radha. I am now describing Sarasvati's character. Hear, O\nMuni! S'ri Kri _sn_ a introduced first in this Bharata, the worship of the\nDevi Sarasvati, the holder of Vi _n_ a in Her hands, under whose influence,\nthe hearts of illiterate stupid persons become illumined with knowledge. The\namorous Devi Sarasvati sprang from the end of the lips of Radha and so she\ndesired to marry Kri _sn_ a out of amorous feelings. S'ri Kri _sn_ a, the\ncontroller of the hearts of all, knew it instantly and addressed the Mother of\nthe people in true words proper to Her and beneficial to Her in the end. O\nChaste One! The four-armed Naraya _n_ a is born from My parts; He is young, of\ngood\n\n\n\np. 820\n\n\n\nfeatures and endowed with all qualifications; so much so, he is like Me. He is\na Knower of amorous sentiments of women and He fulfils those desires; what to\nspeak of His beauty, ten millions of the God of love are playing in His body.\nO Beloved! And if you desire to marry and remain with Me, that will not be of\nany good to you. For Radha is near to Me; She is more powerful than you. If a\nman be stronger than another, he can rescue one who takes his shelter; but if\nhe be weaker, how can he then, himself weak, protect his dependant from\nothers. Though I am the Lord of all, and rule all, yet I cannot control Radha.\nFor She is equal to me in power, in beauty, in qualifications, equal to Me in\nevery respect. Again it is impossible for Me to quit Radha for She is the\npresiding Deity of My life. Who can relinquish life? Though a son is very dear\nto his father, still it may be questioned, is he dearer than his father's\nlife? So, O Auspicious One! Go to the abode Vaiku _nt_ ha; you will get your\ndesires fulfilled there. You will get for your husband the Lord of Vaiku _nt_\nha and you will live ever in peace and enjoy happiness. Though Lak _s_ mi is\nresiding there yet like you she is not under the control of lust, anger,\ngreed, delusion and vanity. She is also equal to you in beauty, qualities, and\npower. So you will live with her in great delight and Hari, the Lord of Vaiku\n_nt_ ha, will treat both of you equally. Moreover, I say this in particular\nthat in every universe, on the fifth day of the bright fortnight of the month\nof Magha, every year, the day when the learning is commenced, a great festival\nwill be held and men, Manus, Devas, and the Munis desirous of liberation,\nVasus, Yogis, Nagas, Siddhas, Gandarbhas, Rak _s_ asas, all will perform your\nworship with devotion in every Kalpa till the time of Maha Pralaya comes. All\nare required to be Jitendriya (having their senses under control) and Samyami\n(concentrating his mind, and with a religious vow) and they will invoke Thee\non a jar or on books and then meditate according to what is stated in the Ka\n_n_ va S'akha of Yajurveda and then worship and sing hymns to Thee. Thy\nKavacha (an armour; a mystical syllable ** considered as a preservative like\narmour) is written on the bark of the Bhurja tree and then with eight kinds of\nscents mingled with it is placed within a golden nut or ring named Maduli and\nthen held on the neck or on the right arm. The learned should recite Thy\nStotras during worship. Thus saying, the Pura _n_ Brahma S'ri Kri _sn_ a\nHimself worshipped the Devi Sarasvati. Since then, Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, Mahes'a,\nAnanta Deva, Dharma, Sanaka and other Munindras, all the Devas, Munis, all the\nkings and all the human beings are worshipping the Devi Sarasvati. O Narada!\nThus the worship of the Eternal Devi is made extant in the three worlds.\n\n\n\n30-31. Narada said :-- O Chief of the Knowers of the Vedas! Now describe to me\nthe methods of worship, Dhyan, Kavacham, hymns, the\n\n\n\np. 821\n\n\n\nappropriate offerings of the Puja flowers, sandalpaste and other good things\nnecessary in these worships and which are so sweet to hear. I am ever very\neager and anxious to hear these.\n\n\n\n32-59. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! I am now stating the method of worship\nof the Devi Sarasvati, the Mother of the Worlds, according to Ka _n_ va S'akha\nof the Yajurveda. Hear. On the day previous to the fifth day of the bright\nfortnight of the month of Magh or the day of commencement of education, the\ndevotee should control his senses, concentrate his mind and take his bath.\nThen he is to perform his daily duties and install the jar (Gha _t_ a) with\ndevotion and according to the Mantras of the Ka _n_ va S'akha or the Tantra,\nas the case may be. He is to worship first on that Ghata (jar) Ga _n_ apati\n(Ganes'a), then meditate the Devi Sarasvati as described below, invoke Her and\nagain read the Dhyan and then worship with So _d_ as'opachara (sixteen good\narticles offered in the worship). O Good One! Now I am speaking, according to\nmy knowledge, about the offerings as ordained in the Vedas or Tantras. Hear.\nFresh butter, curd, thickened milk, rice freed from the husk by frying,\nsweetmeats (Til Laddu) prepared of Til, sugar cane, sugarcane juice, nice Gu\n_d_ (molasses), honey, svastik, sugar, rice (not broken) out of white Dhan,\nchipi _t_ ak of table rice (\xc3\x82lo chal), white Modak, Harbi _s_ yanna prepared\nof boiled rice with clarified butter and salt, Pi _st_ aka of jaoa or wheaten\nflour, Paramanna with ghee, nectar like sweetmeats, cocoanut, cocoanut water,\nSvastik Pi _st_ aka, Svastik and ripe plantain Pi _st_ aka, Kaseru (root),\nMula, ginger, ripe plantains, excellent Bel fruit, the jujube fruit, and other\nappropriate white purified fruits of the season and peculiar to the place are\nto be offered in the Pooja. O Narada! White flowers of good scent, white\nsandalpaste of good scent, new white clothes, nice conchshell, nice garlands\nof white flowers, nice white necklaces, and beautiful ornament are to be given\nto the Devi. I say now the Dhyanam sweet to hear, of the Devi Sarasvati\naccording to the Vedas, capable to remove errors! Hear. I hereby bow down to\nthe Devi Sarasvati, of a white colour, of a smiling countenance and\nexceedingly beautiful, the lustre of whose body overpowers that of the ten\nmillions of Moons, whose garment is purified by fire, in whose hands there are\nVi _n_ a and books, who is decorated with new excellent ornaments of jewels\nand pearls and whom Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, Mahes'vara and the other Devas, Munis,\nManus and men constantly worship. Thus meditating the Devi, the intelligent\npersons should offer all articles, after pronouncing the root Mantra. Then he\nis to hymn and hold Kavacha and make Sa _st_ a _n_ ga pra _n_ ams before the\nDevi. O Muni! Those whose Devi Sarasvati is the presiding Deity, are not to be\nspoken of at all (i.e., they\n\n\n\np. 822\n\n\n\nwill naturally do all these things and with a greater fervour). Besides all\nshould worship the Devi Sarasvati on the day of commencement of education and\nevery year on the S'ukla Panchami day of the month of Magh. The eight-lettered\nMantra, as mentioned in the Vedas is the root Mantra of Sarasvati. (Aim Klim\nSarasvatyai nama _h_ ). Or the Mantra to which each worshipper is initiated is\nhis Mulmantra (not Mantra). Or uttering the Mantra \xc2\x93S'rim Hrim Sarasvatyai\nSvaha\xc2\x94 one is to offer everything to the Devi Sarasvati. This Mantra is the\nKalpa Vrik _s_ a (i. e., the tree which yields all desires). Naraya _n_ a, the\nocean of mercy, gave in ancient times, this very Mantra to Valmiki in the holy\nland Bharata Var _s_ a on the banks of the Ganges; next Bhrigu gave this\nMantra on the occasion of solar eclipse to Mahar _s_ i Sukracharya on the Pu\n_s_ kara Tirtha; Maricha gave to Brihaspati on a lunar eclipse; Brahma gave to\nBhrigu in the Vadarika \xc3\x82s'rama; Jaratkara gave to \xc3\x82stika on the shore of the K\n_s_ iroda ocean; Bibhan _d_ aka gave this to the intelligent Ri _s_ yasri _n_\nga on the Sumeru mountain, S'iva gave this to Ka _n_ ada and Gotama, Surya\ngave to Yaj\xc3\xb1avalkya and Katyayana, Ananta Deva gave to Pa _n_ ini, to the\nintelligent Bharadvaja and to S'aka _t_ ayana in Bali's assembly in the\nPatala. If this Mantra be repeated four lakhs of times, all men attain\nsuccess. And when they become Siddhas with this Mantra, they become powerful\nlike Brihaspati. In past times, the Creator Brahma gave a Kavacha named\nVis'vajaya to Bhrigu on the Gandhamadana Mountain. I now speak of that. Hear.\n\n\n\n60-61. Once on a time Bhrigu asked Brahma the Lord of all, and adored by all,\nthus :-- \xc2\x93O Brahman! Thou art the foremost of those that know the Vedas; there\nis none equal to thee in matters regarding the knowledge of the Vedas (so much\nso that there is nothing that is not known to thee; for all these have sprung\nfrom thee). Now say about the Vis'vajaya Kavacha of the Devi Sarasvati, that\nis excellent, without any faults and embodying in it all the properties of all\nthe Mantras.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n62-91. Brahma said :-- \xc2\x93O Child! What you have asked about the Kavacha of\nSarasvati that is sweet to hear, ordained and worshipped by the Vedas, and the\ngiver of all desired fruits, now hear of that. In the very beginning, the all-\npervading S'ri Kri _sn_ a, the Lord of the Rasa circle, mentioned this Kavacha\nto me in the holy Brindavana forest in the abode Goloka at the time of Rasa in\nRasa Mandala. This is very secret; it is full of holy unheard, wonderful\nMantras. Reading this Kavacha and holding it (on one's arm) Brihaspati has\nbecome foremost in matters of intelligence; by the force of this Kavacha\nS'ukracharya\n\n\n\np. 823\n\n\n\nhas got his ascendancy over the Daityas; the foremost Muni Valmiki has become\neloquent and skilled in language and has become Kavindra and Svayambhuva Manu;\nholding this Kavacha he has become honoured everywhere. Ka _n_ ada, Gotama, Ka\n_n_ va, Pa _n_ ini, S'akatayana, Dak _s_ a, and Katyayana all have become\ngreat authors by virtue of this Kavacha; Kri _sn_ a Dvaipayana Veda Vyasa made\nthe classification of the Vedas and composed the eighteen Pura _n_ as.\nS'atatapa, Samvarta, Vas'i _st_ ha, Parasara and Yaj\xc3\xb1avalkya had become\nauthors by holding and reading this Sarasvati Kavacha. Ri _s_ yas'ri _n_ ga,\nBharadvaja, \xc3\x82stika, Devala, Jaigi _s_ avya, and Yayati all were honoured\neverywhere by virtue of this Kavacha. O Dvija! The Prajapati Himself is the Ri\n_s_ i of this Kavacha; Brihati is its Chha _nd_ a; and S'arada Ambika is its\npresiding Deity. Its application (Viniyoga) is in the acquisition of spiritual\nknowlege, in the fruition of any desires or necessities, in composing poems or\nanywhere wheresoever success is required. May S'rim Hrim Sarasvatyai Svaha\nprotect fully my head; S\xc2\x92rim Vagdevatayai Svaha, my forehead; Om Hrim\nSarasvatyai Svaha, my ears always; Om S\xc2\x92rim Hrim Bhagabatyai Sarasvatyai Svaha\nalways my eyes; Aim Hrim Vagvadinyai Svaha, always my nose; Om Hrim Vidyadhi\n_st_ hatri Devyai Svaha, my lips always; Om S\xc2\x92rim Hrim Brahmyai Svaha my rows\nof teeth; Aim, this single letter protect my neck; Om S\xc2\x92rim Hrim my throat;\nS'rim, my shoulders, Om Hrim Vidyadhi _st_ hatri Devyai Svaha, always my\nchest; Om Hrim Vidyadhisvarupayai Svaha my navel;  Om Hrim Klim Va _n_ yai\nSvaha my hands; Om Svarva varnatmi Kayai Svaha my feet; and let Om Vagadhis\n_t_ hatridevyai Svaha protect all my body. Let Om Sarvakan _t_ havasinyai\nSvaha protect my east; Let Om Svarvajibhagra vasinyai Svaha, the South-east;\nOm Aim Hrim S\xc2\x92rim Klim Sarasvatyai budhajananyai Svaha, my South; Aim Hrim\nS\xc2\x92rim, this three lettered Mantra my South-west; Om Aim Jhibhagravasinyai\nSvaha, my West; Om Svarvam bikayai Svaha, my North west; Om Aim S\xc2\x92rim Klim\nGadyavasinyai Svaha my North; Aim Sarvas'astra vasinyai Svaha, my North-east;\nOm Hrim Sarvapujitayai Svaha, my top; Hrim Pustakavasinyai Svaha my below and\nlet Om Grantha vijasvarupayai Svaha protect all my sides. O Narada! This\nVis'vajaya Kavacha of the nature of Brahma and its embodied Mantra I have now\nspoken to you. I heard this before from the mouth of Dharma Deva in the Ga _n_\ndhamadana mountain. Now I speak this to you out of my great affection for you.\nBut never divulge this to anybody. One is worship one's spiritual Teacher\n(Guru Deva) according to due rites and ceremonies with clothings, ornaments,\nand sandalpaste and then fall down prostrate to him and then hold this\nKavacha. Repeating this\n\n\n\np. 824\n\n\n\nfive lakhs of times, one gets success and becomes a Siddha. The holder of this\nKavacha becomes intelligent like Brihaspati, eloquent, Kavindras, and the\nconqueror of the three worlds, no sooner one becomes a Siddlha in this. In\nfact, he can conquer everything by virtue of this Kavacha. O Muni! Thus I have\ndescribed to you this Kavacha according to Ka _n_ va S'akha. Now I am speaking\nabout the method of worship, Dhyana and the praise of this Kavacha. Hear.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fourth Chapter of the Ninth Book on the hymn, worship and\nKavacha of Sarasvati Devi in S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 5](bk09ch05.htm)\n\n"
