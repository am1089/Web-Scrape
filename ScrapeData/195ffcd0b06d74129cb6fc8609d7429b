Narada said :-- \xc2\x93O Ri _s_ i Naraya _n_ a! O Highly Fortunate One! O Lord!\nThou art equal to Naraya _n_ a whether in beauty or in qualities, or in fame\nor in energy or in everything. Thou art equal to Naraya _n_ a. Thou art the\nforemost of the J\xc3\xb1anins; there cannot be found a second like Thee as a Siddha\nYogi, the ascetics and the Munis. And Thou art the crest of the knowers of the\nVedas. I have heard the wonderful anecdote of Maha Lak _s_ mi that Thou hast\ntold me. Now tell me any other thing that is unknown, very good in everyway,\nin accordance with Dharma, in the Vedas, and that which is not as yet written\nin the Pura _n_ as.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n5-6. Naraya _n_ a said :-- \xc2\x93There are many wonderful hidden anecdotes that are\nnot published as yet in the Pura _n_ as. What you have heard is very small in\nfact. Please mention to me what you like to hear, what you think as best\namongst them and I will describe that to you.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n7-8. Narada said :-- \xc2\x93When clarified butter is poured as libations in all the\nsacrificial ceremonies to the gods, Svaha is to be uttered everywhere as\nexcellent, and commendable; so Svadha is to be repeated in the offerings when\nthe oblations are offered to the Pitris, the deceased ancestors. Then, again,\nDak _s_ i _n_ a (the sacrificial fee) is always to be paid as right and\nexcellent. So, O Knower of the Vedas! I like to hear the accounts of Svadha,\nand Dak _s_ i _n_ a and their merits. Please now tell me about them.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n9\\. Suta said :-- \xc2\x93Hearing the words of Narada, Naraya _n_ a Ri _s_ i smiled\nand began to speak the very ancient words of the Pura _n_ as.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n10-11. Naraya _n_ a said :-- Before the creation, the Devas assembled in the\nbeautiful Brahma\xc2\x92s Council to decide on their food question.\n\n\n\np. 974\n\n\n\nThey all brought to the notice of Brahma the scarcity about their food. Brahma\npromised to remove their food difficulties and began to chant hymns to Hari.\n\n\n\n12\\. Narada said :-- \xc2\x93O Lord! Bhagavan Naraya _n_ a Himself incarnated in part\nas Sacrifice. Are not the Devas satisfied when the Brahma _n_ as pour\noblations of ghee to the Devas in those sacrifices?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n13-17. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Muni! The Devas, in fact, did not get the\nofferings of the clarified butters that were poured in with devotion in\nsacrificial acts by the Brahma _n_ as and K _s_ attriyas. So they were very\nmuch depressed and went again to the council of Brahma and informed Him that\nthey could not get any food for themselves. On hearing this, Brahma at once\nmeditated and took refuge of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a; Kri _sn_ a advised them to\nworship Mula Prakriti. Brahma then, by the command of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, began\nto meditate on Prakriti, worship Her and chant hymns to Her. Then from the\npart of Prakriti, an all-powerful Devi appeared. She was very beautiful,\nShyama (of a blue colour) and very lovely. This Devi was Svaha. She looked\nalways gracious with smile in Her face; it seemed that She was always ready to\nshow favour towards the Bhaktas. She appeared before Brahma and said :-- \xc2\x93O\nLotus born! Want any boon you desire.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n18-22. Hearing Her words, the Creator spoke reverentially :-- \xc2\x93O Devi! Let\nThou be the burning power of Fire; without Thee Fire would not be able to burn\nanything. At the conclusion of any Mantra, whoever taking Thy name, will pour\noblations in the Fire to the Gods, will cause those oblations to go to the\nGods and reach them. And then they will be very glad. O Mother! Let Thou be\nthe wealth of Fire, the beauty and housewife of Fire; let Thou be incessantly\nworshipped in the regions of the Gods and amongst men and other beings.\xc2\x94\nHearing these words of Brahma, Svaha Devi became very sad and expressed Her\nown intentions :-- \xc2\x93I will get Kri _sn_ a as my husband; let me perform\nTapasya as long as it takes. This is my object. All other things are false as\ndreams.\n\n\n\n23-28. I always meditate with devotion on the lotus-feet of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a,\nserving Which You have become the Creator of this world, S\xc2\x92ambhu has become\nthe Conqueror of death, Ananta Deva is supporting this universe, Dharma is the\nWitness of the virtuous, Ganes\xc2\x92a is getting, first of all, the first worship.\nPrakriti Devi has become the adorable of all and the Munis and the Ri _s_ is\nrespected by all.\xc2\x94 O Child! Having spoken thus to the Lotus-born, Padma, with\nHer lotus-face, meditating incessantly on the Lotus-Feet of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a,\nfree from any disease, started to perform\n\n\n\np. 975\n\n\n\ntapasya for attaining Him. She, first of all, stood on one leg and practised\nausterities for one lakh years. Then She saw the Highest Puru _s_ a S\xc2\x92ri\nKrisna, Who is beyond Prakriti and Her attributes. The beautiful amorous\nSvaha, seeing the Lovely Form of the Lord of Love, fainted.\n\n\n\n29-43. The omniscient Bhagavan Kri _sn_ a knowing Her intentions, took Her to\nHis lap, reduced very much in body by long continued Tapasya, and He said :--\n\xc2\x93O Devi! Thou shalt be My wife in the next Varaha Kalpa. Then Thou wilt be the\ndaughter of Nagnajit and wilt be known by the name of Nagnajiti. O Beloved! At\npresent let Thou be the Energy of Fire and be His wife. By My boon Thou wilt\nbe worshipped by all. Fire will make Thee the Lady of His house and take the\nutmost care of Thee. Thou wilt be able to enjoy easily with Him.\xc2\x94 O Narada!\nThus saying to Svaha, Bhagavan disappeared. On the other hand, Fire came in\nthere by the command of Brahma, with a doubtful mind and began to meditate on\nHer, the World Mother as per Sama Veda and worshipped Her. He then pleased and\nmarried Her with mantrams, etc. For one hundred divine years they enjoyed each\nother. In a very solitary place while they were enjoying each other, Svaha\nDevi felt pregnant. For full twelve divine years She retained Her pregnancy.\nThen She delivered gradually three sons Daksi _n_ agni, Garhyapatyagni, and\n\xc3\x82havaniyagni. The Ri _s_ is, Munis, Brahma _n_ as, K _s_ attriyas poured\noblations of clarified butter pronouncing the terminal mantra \xc2\x93Svaha.\xc2\x94 He who\npronounces this excellent terminal Mantra \xc2\x93Svaha\xc2\x94 gets immediate success in\nhis actions. Then all the mantras without \xc2\x93Svaha\xc2\x94 in the end became impotent\nas snakes become when void of poison, the Brahma _n_ as when they are devoid\nof the knowledge of the Vedas, the wife when she does not serve her husband,\nthe men when they turn illiterate and the trees, when void of fruits and\nbranches. O Child! The Brahma _n_ as then became satisfied. The Devas began to\nreceive the oblations. With the \xc2\x93Svaha\xc2\x94 mantra everything turned out fruitful.\nThus I have described to you the anecdote of \xc2\x93'Svaha.\xc2\x94 One who hears this\nessential anecdote gets his happiness enhanced and the Mok _s_ a in his hands.\nWhat more do you want to hear ? Say.\n\n\n\n44\\. Narada said :-- I like to hear how Fire worshipped Svaha and recited\nstotras (hymns of praise) to Her. Kindly tell me the method of worship, the\nDhyanam and Stotra.\n\n\n\n45-49. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Best of Brahma _n_ as! I now tell you the\nmeditation (Dhyanam) as per Sama Veda, the method of worship and stotra.\nListen attentively. At the commencement of any sacrificial ceremony, one\nshould first of all worship whether on the S\xc2\x92alagrama stone or in an earthen\njar (gha _t_ a), the Devi Svaha and then commence the\n\n\n\np. 976\n\n\n\nceremony with the expectation of getting the desired fruit. The following is\nthe Dhyanam (meditation) of Svaha Devi :-- O Devi Svaha! Thou art embodied of\nthe Mantras; Thou art the success of the Mantras; Thou art Thyself a Siddha;\nThou givest success and the the fruits of actions to men; Thou dost good to\nall. Thus meditating, one should offer Padya (water for washing the feet),\netc., uttering the basic Mantra; success then comes to him. Now hear about the\nRadical Seed Mantra. The said mantra (Mula mantra) is this :-- \xc2\x93Om Hrim S\xc2\x92rim\nVahnijayayai Devyai Svaha.\xc2\x94 If the Devi be worshipped with this Mantra, all\nthe desires come to a successful issue.\n\n\n\n50-54. Fire recited the following stotra :-- \xc2\x93Thou art Svaha, Thou art the\nBeloved of Fire, Thou art the wife of Fire; Thou pleasest all; Thou art the\nS\xc2\x92akti, Thou art the action, Thou art the bestower of Kala (time); Thou dost\ndigest the food; Thou art the Dhruva; Thou art the resort of men; Thou art the\nburning power; Thou canst burn everything, Thou art the essence of this world;\nThou art the deliverer from the terrible world; Thou art the life of the gods\nand Thou nourishest the Gods.\xc2\x94 O Narada! He who reads with devotion these\nsixteen names, gets success both in this world as well as in the next. None of\nhis works become deficient in any way; rather all the works are performed\nsuccessfully and with a successful issue. Reading this stotra, one who has no\nwife, gets wife. So much so that the man who recites the stotra gets for his\nwife equal to Rambha, the heavenly nymph, and passes his time in greatest\nbliss.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Forty-third Chapter of the Ninth Book on the history of Svaha in\nS\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, the Maha Pura _n_ am, of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_\ni Veda Vyasa.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 44](bk09ch44.htm)\n\n"
