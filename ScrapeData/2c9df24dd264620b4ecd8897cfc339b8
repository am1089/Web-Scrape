The Ordeal by Water.\n\n304\\. I will now proclaim the excellent law regarding the (ordeal by) water,\n(which may be performed at all seasons) one after the other, excepting the\nwinter and dewy seasons.\n\n* 305. 305 (This ordeal may be performed) in streams\n\np. 112\n\nwhich have not too swift a course, in oceans, in rivers, in lakes, in ponds\ndug by the gods, in tanks, and in pools.\n\n* 306. 306 The diving shall take place after three arrows have been discharged from a bow which must not be too strong. Wise men (have declared) what its strength should be.\n\n* 307. 307 A strong bow is declared to be 107 (A\xe1\xb9\x85gulas) long, a moderate bow 106, and an inferior bow 105 (A\xe1\xb9\x85gulas). This is declared to be the rule regarding the bow.\n\n* 308. A strong man should be placed like a pillar in water, reaching to his navel. The defendant should seize him by the thigh and dive under water.\n\np. 113\n\n* 309. From the place where the arrows have been discharged, a young man endowed with swiftness of limb should walk as quickly as possible to the place where the middlemost arrow has fallen down.\n\n* 310. Another man, who must be an equally swift runner, should seize the middlemost arrow and return with it quickly to the place from which the (first) man has proceeded.\n\n311\\. If he who took the arrow does not see the defendant in water on\narriving, because he is completely under water, the defendant must be\nacquitted.\n\n* 312. Otherwise he is guilty, though only one limb of his have become visible. (He is pronounced guilty) equally, if he has moved to a different place than that where he was first immersed.\n\n* 313. Women or children must not be subjected to the ordeal by water by persons acquainted with the law; nor sick, superannuated, or feeble men.\n\n* 314. Cowards, those tormented by pain, and persons afflicted by a calamity should also be held exempt from this trial. Such persons perish immediately after diving, because they are declared to have hardly any breath.\n\n* 315. Should they even have appeared before the court on account of a serious crime, he must not cause them to dive under water, nor must he subject them to the ordeal by fire, or give them poison.\n\n* 316. 316 \xc2\x91Nothing is more capable than water and fire of showing the difference between right and wrong.\n\np. 114\n\n[paragraph continues] Because fire has arisen from the waters, therefore\nsuspected persons\n\n* 317. Are subjected to this proof by preference, by persons thoroughly conversant with the law. Therefore deign, O venerable Lord of Waters, to effect acquittal through truth.\xc2\x92\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[111:305](sbe3329.htm#fr_322) 305-317. Vish _n_ u XII; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II,\n108, 109.\n\nThe ordeal by water may be briefly described as follows: 1. This ordeal should\nbe either performed in a tank or in a river which has no swift current. 2.\nThree arrows should be discharged from a bow of middling size. 3. After that,\na strong man should enter the water as far as his navel. The defendant should\nseize him by the thigh and dive under water. 4. A swift runner should be sent\nafter the second arrow. When he has reached the place where it has fallen,\nanother equally swift runner should be sent back with it to the place where\nthe defendant has entered the water. 5. The defendant is declared innocent, if\nhe has remained under water till the arrow has been brought back. He is\ndeclared guilty, if any one of his limbs have been seen, or if he were to\nemerge from the water in a different spot from that where he entered it. 6.\nDuring the proceeding, a prayer is addressed to the deity of water, in which\nit is asserted, that fire arose from water, and that the water ordeal is\nsuperior therefore to the ordeal by fire.\n\n305\\. The winter season comprises the months Agrahaya _n_ a and p. 112 Pausha.\nThe dewy or cold season ( _S_ i _s_ ira) comprises the months Magha and\nPhalguna. It appears, therefore, that the ordeal by water must not be\nperformed during the period extending from the middle of November to the\nmiddle of March, i.e. during the cold weather. This is no doubt because the\nlow temperature of the water during the cold weather might affect the capacity\nof the defendant to hold out under water sufficiently long.\n\n[112:306](sbe3329.htm#fr_323) Devakhata. 'a pond dug by the gods,' denotes a\nnatural hollow or lake. (Bohtlingk's Dictionary.) Nandapa _n_ _d_ ita, in his\nCommentary of the Vish _n_ u-sm _ri_ ti (LXIV, 16), gives the well-known lake\nof Pushkara, near A _g_ mir, as an instance of a Devakhata.\n\n[112:307](sbe3329.htm#fr_324) It seems strange that the difference in length\nbetween the bows should not amount to more than one A\xe1\xb9\x85gula or inch. The\ncommentators take the three numerals in this paragraph to denote 105, 106, and\n107 respectively, and I have translated in accordance with this\ninterpretation. It is, however, possible to translate the three numerals by\n500, 600, and 100 respectively, and to refer them to the number of Hastas (1\nHasta = 18 inches) traversed by each of the three arrows. According to another\ntext, which is wrongly attributed to Narada by some commentators, the arrows\nshall be shot at a target, which has to be placed at a distance of 150 Hastas\nfrom the marksman.\n\n[113:316](sbe3329.htm#fr_325) 316, 317. These two paragraphs contain the\nprayer by which the deity of water should be addressed. A. Vish _n_ u XII, 8;\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 108.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 23.
