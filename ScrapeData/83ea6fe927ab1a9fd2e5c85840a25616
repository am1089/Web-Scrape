The full moon, doubtless, is the same as that burning (sun), for\nhe, indeed, is full day by day; and the new moon (dar _s_ a) is the same as\nthe moon, for he appears (dar _s_ ), as it were.\n\n11:2:4:22\\. But they also say inversely, \'The full moon is the same as the\nmoon, for after the filling up of the latter there is the night of full moon;\'\nand the new moon (dar _s_ a) is the same as that burning (sun), for the latter\nappears, as it were.\n\n11:2:4:33\\. The full moon, indeed, is this (earth), for she is, as it were,\nfull; and the new moon is yonder sky, for yonder sky appears (or, is seen), as\nit were.\n\n11:2:4:44\\. The full moon, indeed, is the night, for this\n\np. 31\n\nnight is, as it were, full; and the new moon is the day, for this day appears,\nas it were. This, then, is the theory regarding the full and new moon in\nrespect of the gods.\n\n11:2:4:55\\. Then as to the body. The full moon is the up-breathing, for it is\nby the up-breathing 1 that this man is, as it were, filled; and the new moon\nis the out (and in)-breathing 2, for this out-breathing appears, as it were:\nthus, the full and new moon are these two, the eater and the giver of food.\n\n11:2:4:66\\. The out (and in)-breathing (the mouth) is the eater of food, for\nby means of the out (and in)-breathing this food is eaten; and the up-\nbreathing is the giver of food, for by the up-breathing 3 this food is given\nto him.\n\n11:2:4:77\\. The full moon is the mind, for full, as it were, is this mind; and\nthe new moon is speech, for this speech appears, as it were. Thus these two\nare clearly the full and new moon, as regards the body; and inasmuch as on the\nday of fasting he eats the (food) suitable for eating on the vow, he thereby\nclearly gratifies these two in regard to the body; and on the morrow (he\ngratifies them) as gods by sacrifice.\n\n11:2:4:88\\. As to this they say,--\'Seeing that no offering-material is taken\nout "for the full moon," nor any offering-material "for the new moon," and\nseeing that he does not say, "Recite the invitatory formula for the full\nmoon," nor "Recite the invitatory formula\n\np. 32\n\nfor the new moon;" nor "Recite the offering-formula for the full moon," nor\n"Recite the offering-formula for the new moon," how, then, is offering made to\nthis full and new moon?\' Well, when he makes a libation of ghee to the Mind--\nthe full moon being the Mind--he thereby makes offering to the full moon; and\nwhen he makes a libation of ghee to Speech--the new moon being Speech--he\nthereby makes offering to the new moon: and thus offering is made by him to\nthe full and new moon.\n\n11:2:4:99\\. Now, some prepare two messes of rice, one for Sarasvat on the full\nmoon, and one for Sarasvati on the new moon, saying, \'We thus clearly make\noffering to the full and new moon.\' But let him not do this; for Sarasvat is\nthe Mind, and Sarasvati is Speech; and thus, in making libations of ghee to\nthese two, offering is made by him to the full and new moon: let him therefore\nnot prepare these two messes of rice.\n\n11:2:4:1010\\. As to this they say, \'Surely, he who performs the Full and New-\nmoon offerings becomes a (mere) utterer of the \xc3\x82gur 1; for, when he has\nperformed\n\np. 33\n\nthe Full-moon offering, he knows that he will perform the New-moon offering;\nand when he has performed the New-moon offering, he knows that he will again\nperform the Full-moon offering; thus when he goes to the other world he goes\nthither as an utterer of the \xc3\x82gur: how, then, does he become one who has not\n(merely) uttered the \xc3\x82gur?\' Well, when, on both occasions, he makes those two\nlibations of ghee (to Mind and Speech), then his Full and New-moon offerings\nbecome complete; and he goes to the other world after his Full and New-moon\nofferings are completed, and thus becomes one who has not (merely) uttered the\n\xc3\x82gur.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[31:1](sbe44014.htm#fr_143) The udana is explained by Saya _n_ a as the breath\npassing (up into the head, and) through the nose.\n\n[31:2](sbe44014.htm#fr_144) The pra _n_ a is the breath of the mouth.\n\n[31:3](sbe44014.htm#fr_145) That is, by (the vital air of) the head (hence of\nthe eyes, ears, &c.).\n\n[32:1](sbe44014.htm#fr_146) Or, one who has only had the \xc3\x82gur-formulas uttered\nfor him (by the priests). \xc3\x82gur is the technical term of two formulas, viz. of\nthe formula \'(Agnim) ya _g_ a\' (recite the offering-formula to Agni, or to\nwhatever deity offering is made), by which the Adhvaryu calls on the Hot _ri_\nto recite; and of the formula \'Ye ya _g_ amahe (Agnim),\' by which the Hot _ri_\nintroduces the ya _g_ ya, or offering-verse. At the Soma-sacrifice the former\nformula is modified to \'Hota yakshat,\' uttered by the Maitravaru _n_ a priest.\nSee Haug, Transl. of Ait. Br., p. 133, note.--In comparing these \xc3\x82gur-formulas\nwith the performances of the Full and New-moon offerings, the author thus\nseems to imply that, just as the utterance of these formulas is merely the\npreliminary to the oblation itself, so each fortnightly p. 33 performance is\nonly the preliminary to the next performance; but that the Sacrificer never\nactually completes the sacrifice. Saya _n_ a, on the other hand, takes\n\'agurtin\' to mean \'one who has formed a resolution (agurta, agura _n_ am = sa\n_m_ kalpa);\' and native dictionaries, indeed, give \'agur\' as a synonym of\n\'prati _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a\' (promise, agreement; Zuruf, Zusage). But, even if this were\nthe right meaning of the word, the general drift of the passage would remain\nthe same, viz. that such a sacrificer would ultimately die as one who had\nmerely promised or intended to offer sacrifice, without his having actually\nperformed it, or brought it to a proper conclusion, and thus without reaping\nthe ultimate benefit from it, viz. citizenship in the heavenly abodes.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 2, 5.
