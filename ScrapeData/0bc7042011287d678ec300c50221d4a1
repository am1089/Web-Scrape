I had warned him repeatedly not to send me\n\np. 60\n\nmere fables, such as I had read about his Guru in several Indian periodicals,\nand I believe he fully understood what I meant. Yet we can hardly fail to see\nthe first beginnings of the ravages which the Dialogic Process works even in\nthe first generation. Given his own veneration for his departed master, there\nis a natural unwillingness, nay, an incapability, to believe or to repeat\nanything that might place his master in an unfavourable light. Besides, his\nmaster was dead when these records were written, and the _de mortuis nihil\nnisi bonum_ is deeply engraved in every human heart. What is believed and told\nby everybody in a small village, chiefly by his friends and admirers, is not\nlikely to be contradicted; and if once a man is looked upon as different from\nothers, as possessed of superhuman and miraculous powers, everybody has\nsomething new to add in confirmation of what everybody is ready to believe,\nwhile a doubt or a denial is treated as a sign of unkindness, possibly of envy\nor malice. The story, for instance, of the Brahman lady who was sent as a\nmessenger and teacher to Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a, will sound to us far from\nprobable. But when I first heard of it, this lady was represented as a kind of\ngoddess who met her pupil in a forest and instructed him, like another\nSarasvati, in all the Vedas, Pura _n_ as, and philosophies. The difficulty\nthat had to be solved by this heavenly apparition was, no doubt, the fact that\nRamak _ri_ sh _n_ a had never received a proper classical education, and yet\nspoke with authority about the ancient literature and religion of his\ncountrymen. The fact that he was ignorant of Sanskrit, nay, that he did not\nknow a single word of the sacred language of India, is\n\np. 61\n\ndenied by nobody, and has been distinctly asserted by one of his great\nadmirers, the Rev. P. C. Mozoomdar. Of course he knew Bengali, and a man who\nspeaks Bengali can guess the meaning of Sanskrit as an Italian may guess the\nmeaning of Latin. Some of the classical Sanskrit texts exist in Bengali\ntranslations, and may have given him all the information which he wanted for\nhis own purposes, to say nothing of his constant intercourse with learned men\nwho would have warned him against mistakes and answered any question he chose\nto ask. Thus the _Dea ex machina_ was really not wanted. If this Brahman lady\nwas called a goddess, we must remember that Devi is not much more than a title\nof honour given to high-born and illustrious ladies, nay, that an\nexceptionally well-informed and en-lightened lady might well have been spoken\nof as an incarnation of the goddess Sarasvati. In India the distance between\ndeity and humanity is very small; gods are believed to become men, and men\ngods, without much ado about it.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Mozoomdar's Judgement](rls16.htm)\n\n"
