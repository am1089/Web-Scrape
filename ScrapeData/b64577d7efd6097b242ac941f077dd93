BRAHMA was the first of the Devas, the maker of the universe, the\npreserver of the world. He told the knowledge of Brahman, the foundation of\nall knowledge, to his eldest son Atharva 1.\n\n2\\. Whatever Brahma told Atharvan, that knowledge of Brahman Atharvan formerly\ntold to A\xe1\xb9\x85gir; he told it to Satyavaha Bharadva _g_ a, and Bharadva _g_ a told\nit in succession to A\xe1\xb9\x85giras.\n\n3\\. _S_ aunaka, the great householder, approached A\xe1\xb9\x85giras respectfully and\nasked: 'Sir, what is that through which, if it is known, everything else\nbecomes known?'\n\n4\\. He said to him: 'Two kinds of knowledge must be known, this is what all\nwho know Brahman tell us, the higher and the lower knowledge.'\n\n5\\. 9 The lower knowledge is the _Ri_ g-veda, Ya _g_ ur-veda, Sama-veda,\nAtharva-veda, _S_ iksha (phonetics), Kalpa (ceremonial), Vyakara _n_ a\n(grammar), Nirukta (etymology), _Kh_ andas (metre), _G_ yotisha (astronomy) 2;\n\np. 28\n\nbut the higher knowledge is that by which the Indestructible (Brahman) is\napprehended.'\n\n6\\. 'That which cannot be seen, nor seized, which has no family and no caste\n1, no eyes nor ears, no hands nor feet, the eternal, the omnipresent (all-\npervading), infinitesimal, that which is imperishable, that it is which the\nwise regard as the source of all beings.'\n\n7\\. 'As the spider sends forth and draws in its thread, as plants grow on the\nearth, as from every man hairs spring forth on the head and the body, thus\ndoes everything arise here from the Indestructible.'\n\n8\\. 'The Brahman swells by means of brooding (penance) 2; hence is produced\nmatter (food); from matter breath 3, mind, the true 4, the worlds (seven), and\nfrom the works (performed by men in the worlds), the immortal (the eternal\neffects, rewards, and punishments of works).'\n\np. 29\n\n9\\. 'From him who perceives all and who knows all, whose brooding (penance)\nconsists of knowledge, from him (the highest Brahman) is born that Brahman 1,\nname, form 2, and matter (food).'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[27:1](sbe15016.htm#fr_154) The change between Atharva and Atharvan, like that\nbetween Na _k_ iketas and Na _k_ iketa, shows the freedom of the phraseology\nof the Upanishad, and cannot be used for fixing the date of the constituent\nelements of the Upanishad.\n\n[27:2](sbe15016.htm#fr_155) Other MSS. add here itihasa-pura _n_ a-nyaya-mima\n_m_ sa-dharma- _s_ astra _n_ i.\n\n[28:1](sbe15016.htm#fr_156) I translate var _n_ a by caste on account of its\nconjunction with gotra. The commentator translates, 'without origin and\nwithout qualities.' We should say that which belongs to no genus or species.\n\n[28:2](sbe15016.htm#fr_157) I have translated tapas by brooding, because this\nis the only word in English which combines the two meanings of warmth and\nthought. Native authorities actually admit two roots, one tap, to burn, the\nother tap, to meditate; see commentary on Para _s_ ara-sm _ri_ ti, p. 39b (MS.\nBodl.), Tapa _h_ kri _k_ _kh_ ra _k_ andraya _n_ adirupe _n_ aharavar _g_\nanam.

VI, 7 and III, 10,\nseems to mean buddhi. Here it is explained by the five elements.\n\n[29:1](sbe15016.htm#fr_160) Hira _n_ yagarbha. Comm.\n\n[29:2](sbe15016.htm#fr_161) Namarupam, a very frequent concept in Buddhistic\nliterature.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2](sbe15017.htm)\n\n"
