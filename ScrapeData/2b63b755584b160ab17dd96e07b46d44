He makes the additional by-offerings:--with \'Go thou to the\nsacrifice 2, Hail!\' The sacrifice is water, and seed is water: he thus casts\nseed.\n\n3:8:5:22\\. \'Go thou to Soma, Hail!\' Soma is seed: he thus casts seed.\n\n3:8:5:33\\. \'Go thou to the heavenly ether, Hail!\' The heavenly ether is water,\nand seed is water: he thus casts seed.\n\n3:8:5:44\\. \'Go thou to Agni Vai _s_ vanara, Hail!\' Agni Vai _s_ vanara\n(\'belonging to all men\') is this earth, and she is a safe resting-place: upon\nthat safe resting-place he thus produces (creatures).\n\n3:8:5:55\\. He then touches his mouth, with, \'Give me mind and heart!\' thus\nindeed the by-offerer does not throw himself after (the oblations into the\nfire).\n\n3:8:5:66\\. Thereupon 3 they perform the Patnisa _m_ ya _g_ as\n\np. 215\n\nwith the tail (of the victim), for the tail is the hind-part, and from the\nhind-part of woman offspring is produced: hence offspring is produced by the\nPatnisa _m_ ya _g_ as being performed with the tail.\n\n3:8:5:77\\. For the wives of the gods he cuts portions from the inside, since\nit is from the inside of woman that offspring is produced; for Agni the\nhouseholder from above, since it is from above that the male approaches the\nfemale.\n\n3:8:5:88\\. Thereupon they betake themselves, with the heart-spit, to the\npurificatory bath 1. Now, the anguish of the victim, in being slaughtered,\nconcentrates itself into the heart, and from the heart into the heart-spit;\nand whatever part of cooked (food) is pierced that becomes palatable 2:\ntherefore let him roast it on the spit after piercing it. Uppermost on the\nthrice-moved (portions of the) victim he places that heart after pulling it\noff (the spit).\n\n9\\. He (the slaughterer) then hands the heart-spit (to the Adhvaryu). Let him\nnot throw it on the\n\np. 216\n\nground, nor into the water; for were he to throw it on the ground, that\nanguish would enter into the plants and trees; and were he to throw it into\nthe water, that anguish would enter into the water: hence neither on the\nground, nor into the water.\n\n3:8:5:1010\\. But on going down to the water, let him bury it at the place\nwhere the dry and the moist meet. But if he feel disinclined to going down (to\nthe water), he pours out a vessel of water in front of the sacrificial stake\nand buries (the spit) at the place where the dry and the moist meet, with (Va\n_g_. S. VI, 22), \'Injure thou not the waters nor the plants!\' thus it injures\nneither the waters nor the plants; \'From every fetter 1\\--therefrom deliver\nus, O king Varu _n_ a! That they say, we swear by the "Inviolable (cows)," by\n"Varu _n_ a 2,"\n\np. 217\n\ntherefrom deliver us, O Varu _n_ a!\' Thereby he delivers him 1 from every\nnoose of Varu _n_ a, from all (guilt) against Varu _n_ a.\n\n3:8:5:1111\\. He then addresses (the water) 2 with, \'May the waters and plants\nbe friendly unto us, unfriendly to him who hateth us, and whom we hate!\' For\nwhen they proceed with that (spit), the waters, forsooth, as well as the\nplants, keep as it were receding from him; but hereby he now makes a covenant\nwith them, and so they again approach to him, and that expiation is performed\n(to them). He does not perform (the spit-bath) at the animal offering to Agni\nand Soma, nor at that to Agni, but only at that of the Anubandhya-cow 3, for\ntherewith the whole sacrifice attains to completion. And in that they perform\n(the ceremony) with the heart-spit at the cow (offering), thereby indeed it\ncomes to be performed also for the animal offering to Agni and Soma, as well\nas for that to Agni.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[214:2](sbe2635.htm#fr_539) The Ka _n_ va text (as the Taitt. S.) reverses the\norder of this and the following formula. Nor does it begin a new Brahma _n_ a\nhere.\n\n[214:3](sbe2635.htm#fr_540) Having completed the last after-offering, the\nAdhvaryu, in the p. 215 first place, throws the first chip of the sacrificial\nstake into the fire, in accordance with [III, 7, 1, 32](sbe2627.htm#3:7:1:32).\nFor the four Patnisa _m_ ya _g_ as, the deities of which are Soma, Tvash _t_\n_ri_ , the wives of the gods, and Agni the householder, see part i, p. 256,\nThe first two offerings may consist only of ghee, or, as the last two, of a\npiece of the tail.\n\n[215:1](sbe2635.htm#fr_541) The technical term for this purificatory ceremony\nis _s_ ulavabh _ri_ tha, or spit-bath.\' On the present occasion it is not\nperformed (see [paragraph 11](sbe2635.htm#3:8:5:11)), but it is inserted here\nbecause it forms the conclusion of the ordinary animal offering, not connected\nwith the Soma-sacrifice (niru _dh_ a-pa _s_ u), as well as of the offering of\na sterile cow (termed anubandhya) to Mitra and Varu _n_ a, which concludes the\nSoma-sacrifice. See part i, p. 379, note 1, and [IV, 5, 2,\n1](sbe2661.htm#4:5:2:1) seq.\n\n[215:2](sbe2635.htm#fr_542) ? Ala _m_ _g_ usha, \'sufficient for eating,\' Saya\n_n_ a, \'sufficient in itself,\' St. Petersburg Dict. The Ka _n_ va text has the\nprobably preferable reading,--atha ala _m_ gusha _m_ _s_ ritam eva parit _ri_\nndanti,--they then pierce (with the spit) what is already sufficiently cooked.\n\n[216:1](sbe2635.htm#fr_543) This is a doubtful rendering in accordance with\nthe suggestion in the St. Petersburg Dict., that \'dhamno-dhamna _h_ \' in this\npassage is an old corruption of \'damno-damna _h_.\' The Taitt. S. has the sane\nreading. Saya _n_ a and Mahidhara take it in the sense of \'from every place\n(infested by enemies, or, rendered fearful by thy noose) deliver us!\' Could\n\'dhamno-dhamna _h_ \' be taken as gen. to \'ra _g_ an?\'\n\n[216:2](sbe2635.htm#fr_544) ? Or, \'That they say (i.e. mention the word)\n"Cows,"--that we swear by "Varu _n_ a,"--therefrom deliver us, O Varu _n_ a!\'\nIf the mentioning of words for cow (as well as the taking in vain of Varu _n_\na\'s name) is meant to he censured in this passage, _S_ at. Br. II, 2, 4, 14\n(part i, p. 326 note) may be compared. It seems, however, doubtful whether the\nauthor of the Brahma _n_ a took the term aghnya _h_ as referring to \'cows\'\nhere. The St. Petersburg Dict., s.v. _s_ ap, translates, \'when we swear by the\nname of Varu _n_ a.\' Instead of \'Yad ahur aghnya iti varu _n_ eti _s_\napamahe,\' the Taitt. S (I, 3, 11, 1) reads \'Yad apo aghniya varu _n_ eti _s_\napamahe,\' which Saya _n_ a explains by \'O ye waters, O ye Aghnya _h_ (?\ninviolable ones, cows, waters), O Varu _n_ a! thus we solicit thee (to avert\nevil from us);\' adding a passage to the effect that he who approaches his\nbetter (addressing him) by name, wishes him \'pu _n_ yarti;\' while in the\npresent mantra, he contends there is no mere \'taking the name of Varu _n_ a in\nvain.\'\n\n[217:1](sbe2635.htm#fr_545) I.e. the sacrificer (or the victim representing\nthe sacrificer).\n\n[217:2](sbe2635.htm#fr_546) According to the Ka _n_ va text and Katy. VI, 10,\n5 they (the priests and sacrificer) touch the water while muttering the\nformula--\'From every fetter . . . . and whom we hate.\'\n\n[217:3](sbe2635.htm#fr_547) See [IV, 5, 1, 5](sbe2660.htm#4:5:1:5) seq.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III. 9, 1.
