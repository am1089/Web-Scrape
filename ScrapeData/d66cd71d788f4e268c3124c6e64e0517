You seem, indeed, to\nconfuse my mind by equivocal words. Therefore, declare one thing\ndeterminately, by which I may attain the highest good.\n\nThe Deity said:\n\nO sinless one! I have already declared, that in this world there is a twofold\npath 5\\--that of the Sa _n_ khyas by devotion in the shape of (true)\nknowledge; and that of the Yogins by devotion in the shape of action. A man\ndoes not attain freedom from action 6 merely by not engaging in action; nor\ndoes he attain perfection 7 by mere 8 renunciation. For nobody ever remains\neven for an instant without\n\np. 53\n\nperforming some action; since the qualities of nature constrain everybody, not\nhaving free-will (in the matter), to some action 1. The deluded man who,\nrestraining the organs of action 2, continues to think in his mind about\nobjects of sense, is called a hypocrite. But he, O Ar _g_ una! who restraining\nhis senses by his mind 3. and being free from attachments, engages in devotion\n(in the shape) of action, with the organs of action, is far superior. Do you\nperform prescribed action, for action is better than inaction, and the support\nof your body, too, cannot be accomplished with inaction. This world is\nfettered by all action other than action for the purpose of the sacrifice 4.\nTherefore, O son of Kunti! do you, casting off attachment, perform action for\nthat purpose. The Creator, having in olden times created men together with the\nsacrifice, said: 'Propagate with this. May it be the giver to you of the\nthings you desire. Please the gods with this, and may those gods please you.\nPleasing each other, you will attain the highest good. For pleased with the\nsacrifices, the gods will give you the enjoyments you desire. And he who\nenjoys himself without giving them what they have given, is, indeed, a thief.'\nThe good, who eat the leavings of a sacrifice, are released from all sins. But\nthe unrighteous ones, who prepare food for themselves only, incur sin 5.\n\np. 54\n\n[paragraph continues] From food are born (all) creatures; from rain is the\nproduction of food; rain is produced by sacrifices; sacrifices are the result\nof action; know that action has its source in the Vedas; the Vedas come from\nthe Indestructible. Therefore the all-comprehending Vedas are always concerned\nwith sacrifices 1. He who in this world does not turn round the wheel\nrevolving thus, is of sinful life, indulging his senses, and, O son of P _ri_\ntha! he lives in vain. But the man who is attached to his self only, who is\ncontented in his self, and is pleased with his self 2, has nothing to do. He\nhas no interest at all in what is done, and none whatever in what is not done,\nin this world 3; nor is any interest of his dependent on any being. Therefore\n4 always perform action, which must be performed, without attachment. For a\nman, performing action without attachment, attains the Supreme. By action\nalone, did _G_ anaka and the rest work for perfection 5. And having regard\nalso to the keeping of people (to their duties) you should perform action.\nWhatever a great man does, that other men also do. And people follow whatever\nhe receives as authority. There is nothing, O son of P _ri_ tha! for me to do\nin (all) the three worlds,\n\np. 55\n\nnothing to acquire which has not been acquired. Still I do engage in action.\nFor should I at any time not engage without sloth in action, men would follow\nin my path from all sides, O son of P _ri_ tha! If I did not perform actions,\nthese worlds would be destroyed, I should be the cause of caste\ninterminglings; and I should be ruining these people. As the ignorant act, O\ndescendant of Bharata! with attachment to action, so should a wise man act\nwithout attachment, wishing to keep the people (to their duties). A wise man\nshould not shake the convictions of the ignorant who are attached to action,\nbut acting with devotion (himself ) should make them apply themselves to all\naction. He whose mind is deluded by egoism thinks himself the doer of the\nactions, which, in every way, are done by the qualities of nature 1. But he, O\nyou of mighty arms! who knows the truth about the difference from qualities\nand the difference from actions 2, forms no attachments, believing that\nqualities deal with qualities 3. But those who are deluded by the qualities of\nnature form attachments to the actions of the qualities 4. A man of perfect\nknowledge should not shake these men of imperfect knowledge (in their\nconvictions). Dedicating all actions to me with a mind knowing the relation of\nthe supreme and individual self, engage in battle without\n\np. 56\n\ndesire, without (any feeling that this or that is) mine, and without any\nmental trouble 1. Even those men who always act on this opinion of mine, full\nof faith, and without carping, are released from all actions. But those who\ncarp at my opinion and do not act upon it, know them to be devoid of\ndiscrimination, deluded as regards all knowledge 2, and ruined. Even a man of\nknowledge acts consonantly to his own nature 3. All beings follow nature. What\nwill restraint effect? Every sense has its affections and aversions towards\nits objects fixed. One should not become subject to them, for they are one's\nopponents 4. One's own duty, though defective, is better than another's duty\nwell performed. Death in (performing) one's own duty is preferable; the\n(performance of the) duty of others is dangerous.\n\nAr _g_ una said:\n\nBut by whom, O descendant of V _ri_ sh _n_ i! is man impelled, even though\nunwilling, and, as it were, constrained by force, to commit sin?\n\np. 57\n\nThe Deity said:\n\nIt is desire, it is wrath 1, born from the quality of passion; it is very\nravenous, very sinful. Know that that is the foe in this world. As fire is\nenveloped by smoke, a mirror by dust, the f\xc2\x9ctus by the womb, so is this 2\nenveloped by desire. Knowledge, O son of Kunti! is enveloped by this constant\nfoe of the man of knowledge, in the shape of desire, which is like a fire 3\nand insatiable. The senses, the mind, and the understanding are said to be its\nseat 4; with these it deludes the embodied (self) after enveloping knowledge.\nTherefore, O chief of the descendants of Bharata! first restrain your senses,\nthen cast off this sinful thing which destroys knowledge and experience 5. It\nhas been said 6, Great are the senses, greater than the senses is the mind,\ngreater than the mind is the understanding. What is greater than the\nunderstanding is that 7. Thus knowing that which is higher than the\nunderstanding, and restraining (your)self by (your)self, O you of mighty\n\np. 58\n\narms! destroy this unmanageable enemy in the shape of desire.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[52:1](sbe0804.htm#fr_152) Either pride or, better, the false notion mentioned\ninfra, p. 55.\n\n[52:2](sbe0804.htm#fr_153) An almost identical expression occurs in the\nDhammapada, stanza 367, and Maitri-upanishad, p. 37.\n\n[52:3](sbe0804.htm#fr_154) The state of identification of oneself with the\nBrahman, which results from a correct knowledge of the Brahman.\n\n[52:4](sbe0804.htm#fr_155) Infra, [p. 66](sbe0807.htm#page_66).\n\n[52:5](sbe0805.htm#fr_156) Supra, [p. 47](sbe0804.htm#page_47).\n\n[52:6](sbe0805.htm#fr_157) I. e., according to _S_ a _n_ kara, identification\nof oneself with Brahman.\n\n[52:7](sbe0805.htm#fr_158) Final emancipation.\n\n[52:8](sbe0805.htm#fr_159) I. e. not coupled with knowledge and purity of\nheart.\n\n[53:1](sbe0805.htm#fr_160) Cf. infra, pp.\n[122](sbe0820.htm#page_122)-[128](sbe0820.htm#page_128).\n\n[53:2](sbe0805.htm#fr_161) Hands, feet, &c.\n\n[53:3](sbe0805.htm#fr_162) By means of true discrimination keeping the senses\nfrom attachments to worldly objects, which lead to sin and evil.\n\n[53:4](sbe0805.htm#fr_163) Cf. infra, pp. [60](sbe0806.htm#page_60),\n[61](sbe0806.htm#page_61). Probably the 'sacrifices' spoken of in that passage\nmust be taken to be the same as those referred to in the Creator's injunction\nmentioned in this passage.\n\n[53:5](sbe0805.htm#fr_164) Cf. Maitri-upanishad, p. 143\n\n[54:1](sbe0805.htm#fr_165) The commentators explain this to mean that though\nthe Vedas elucidate all matters, their principal subject is the sacrifice.\n\n[54:2](sbe0805.htm#fr_166) The distinctions here are rather nice,--an ordinary\nman is 'attached' to worldly objects, is 'contented' with goods &c., and is\npleased' with special gains.\n\n[54:3](sbe0805.htm#fr_167) No good or evil accrues to him from anything he\ndoes or omits to do.\n\n[54:4](sbe0805.htm#fr_168) _S_ ridhara says that Ar _g_ una is here told to\nperform action, as freedom from it is only for the man of true knowledge,\nwhich Ar _g_ una is not as yet.\n\n[54:5](sbe0805.htm#fr_169) I. e. final emancipation; cf. [p.\n59](sbe0806.htm#page_59) infra, and \xc3\x8e _s_ opanishad, p. 6.\n\n[55:1](sbe0805.htm#fr_170) The active principle is nature, the aggregate of\nthe three qualities; the soul is only the looker-on;, cf. inter alia, [p.\n104](sbe0815.htm#page_104) infra.\n\n[55:2](sbe0805.htm#fr_171) Scil. the difference of the soul from the\ncollection of qualities, viz. the body, senses. &c., and from the actions of\nwhich they are the authors.\n\n[55:3](sbe0805.htm#fr_172) Qualities (i. e. senses) deal with qualities, i. e.\nobjects of sense.\n\n[55:4](sbe0805.htm#fr_173) I. e. all mundane affairs.\n\n[56:1](sbe0805.htm#fr_174) About the consequences of your actions.\n\n[56:2](sbe0805.htm#fr_175) Of actions, or of the Brahman in its various forms.\n\n[56:3](sbe0805.htm#fr_176) Which is the result of the virtues and vices of a\npreceding life. The sequence of ideas here is as follows:--The true view\nstated here about the 'difference from qualities and actions' is disregarded\nby some, owing to their nature' as now explained. Then the question is, if\nnature is so potent, what is the good of the _S_ astras? The answer is, Nature\nonly acts through our likes and dislikes. Withstand them and then you can\nfollow the _S_ astras. It is under the influence of these likes and dislikes,\nthat some may say, we shall practise duties prescribed for others (our own\nbeing bad ones) as they are equally prescribed by the _S_ astras. That, as\nstated in the last sentence here, is wrong.\n\n[56:4](sbe0805.htm#fr_177) Cf. Sutta Nipata, p. 101, as to 'likings and\ndislikings.'\n\n[57:1](sbe0805.htm#fr_178) Vide [p. 50](sbe0804.htm#page_50) supra.\n\n[57:2](sbe0805.htm#fr_179) I. e. knowledge, mentioned in the next sentence,\nfor which construction [p. 71](sbe0808.htm#page_71) and [p.\n98](sbe0813.htm#page_98) may be compared.\n\n[57:3](sbe0805.htm#fr_180) Which becomes more powerful the more it is fed.\n\n[57:4](sbe0805.htm#fr_181) The mind is that which ponders over things as such\nor such the understanding is that which finally determines (cf. Lewes' History\nof Philosophy, II, 463-465). These and the senses are the 'seat' of desire,\nbecause the perception of an object by the sense, the pondering over it by the\nmind, and the determination about it by the understanding are the\npreliminaries to the awakening of the desire; supra, [p.\n50](sbe0804.htm#page_50).\n\n[57:5](sbe0805.htm#fr_182) Knowledge is from books or teachers, experience is\nthe result of personal perception.\n\n[57:6](sbe0805.htm#fr_183) Ka _th_ opanishad, p. 114; and see also pp.\n[148](sbe0821.htm#page_148), [149](sbe0822.htm#page_149).\n\n[57:7](sbe0805.htm#fr_184) I. e. the supreme Being, as in the Ka _th_\nopanishad.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter IV](sbe0806.htm)\n\n"
