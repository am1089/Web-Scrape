If, O Janardana, according to Thee, knowledge is superior to action, why\nthen, O Keshava, dost Thou engage me in this terrible action?\n\np. 73\n\n2\\. With these seemingly conflicting words, Thou art, as it were, bewildering\nmy understanding;--tell me that one thing for certain, by which I can attain\nto the highest.\n\nThe Blessed Lord said:\n\n3\\. In the beginning (of creation), O sinless one, the twofold path of\ndevotion was given by Me to this world;--the path of knowledge for the\nmeditative, the path of work for the active. 3\n\np. 74\n\n4\\. By non-performance of work none reaches worklessness; by merely giving up\naction no one attains to perfection. 4\n\n5\\. Verily none can ever rest for even an instant, without performing action;\nfor all are made to act, helplessly indeed, by the Gunas, born of Prakriti. 5\n\np. 75\n\n6\\. He, who restraining the organs of action, sits revolving in the mind,\nthoughts regarding objects of senses, he, of deluded understanding, is called\na hypocrite.\n\n7\\. But, who, controlling the senses by the mind, unattached, directs his\norgans of action to the path of work, he, O Arjuna, excels.\n\np. 76\n\n8\\. Do thou perform obligatory * action; for action is superior to inaction,\nand even the bare maintenance of thy body would not be possible if thou art\ninactive.\n\n9\\. The world is bound by actions other than those performed for the sake of\nYajna; do thou therefore, O son of Kunti, perform action for Yajna alone,\ndevoid of attachment. 9\n\np. 77\n\n10\\. The Prajapati, having in the beginning created mankind together with\nYajna, said,--"By this shall ye multiply: this shall be the milch cow of your\ndesires. 10\n\n11\\. "Cherish the Devas with this, and may those Devas cherish you: thus\ncherishing one another, ye shall gain the highest good. 11\n\np. 78\n\n12\\. "The Devas, cherished by Yajna, will give you desired-for objects." So,\nhe who enjoys objects given by the Devas without offering (in return) to them,\nis verily a thief.\n\n13\\. The good, eating the remnants of Yajna, are freed from all sins: but who\ncook food (only) for themselves, those sinful ones eat sin. 13\n\np. 79\n\n14\\. From food come forth beings: from rain food is produced: from Yajna\narises rain and Yajna is born of Karma. 14\n\np. 80\n\n15\\. Know Karma to have risen from the Veda, and the Veda from the\nImperishable. Therefore the all-pervading Veda is ever centred in Yajna. 15\n\n16\\. He, who here follows not the wheel thus set revolving, living in sin, and\nsatisfied in the senses, O son of Pritha,--he lives in vain. 16\n\np. 81\n\n17\\. But the man who is devoted to the Self, and is satisfied with the Self,\nand content in the Self alone, he has no obligatory duty.\n\n18\\. He has no object in this world (to gain) by doing (an action), nor (does\nhe incur any loss) by non-performance of action,--nor has he (need of)\ndepending on any being for any object.\n\np. 82\n\n19\\. Therefore, do thou always perform actions which are obligatory, without\nattachment;--by performing action without attachment, one attains to the\nhighest.\n\n20\\. Verily by action alone, Janaka and others attained perfection;--also,\nsimply with the view for the guidance of men, thou shouldst perform action. 20\n\np. 83\n\n21\\. Whatsoever the superior person does, that is followed by others. What he\ndemonstrates by action, that, people follow.\n\n22\\. I have, O son of Pritha, no duty, nothing that I have not gained, and\nnothing that I have to gain, in the three worlds; yet, I continue in action.\n\np. 84\n\n23\\. If ever I did not continue in work, without relaxation, men, O son of\nPritha, would in every way, follow in My wake.\n\n24\\. If I did not do work, these worlds would perish. I should be the cause of\nthe admixture of races, and I should ruin these beings.\n\n25\\. As do the unwise, attached to work, act, so should the wise act, O\ndescendant of Bharata, (but) without\n\np. 85\n\nattachment, desirous of the guidance of the world.\n\n26\\. One should not unsettle the understanding of the ignorant, attached to\naction; the wise, (himself) steadily acting, should engage (the ignorant) in\nall work.\n\n27\\. The Gunas of Prakriti perform all action. With the understanding deluded\nby egoism, man thinks, "I am the doer."\n\np. 86\n\n28\\. But, one, with true insight into the domains of Guna and Karma, knowing\nthat Gunas as senses merely rest on Gunas as objects, does not become\nattached. 28\n\n29\\. Men of perfect knowledge should not unsettle (the understanding of)\npeople of dull wit and imperfect knowledge, who deluded by the Gunas of\nPrakriti attach (themselves) to the functions of the Gunas. 29\n\np. 87\n\n30\\. Renouncing all actions to Me, with mind centred on the Self, getting rid\nof hope and selfishness, fight,--free from (mental) fever.\n\n31\\. Those men who constantly practise this teaching of Mine, full of Shraddha\nand without cavilling, they too, are freed from work. 31\n\np. 88\n\n32\\. But those who decrying this teaching of Mine do not practise (it),\ndeluded in all knowledge, and devoid of discrimination, know them to be\nruined.\n\n33\\. Even a wise man acts in accordance with his own nature: beings follow\nnature: what can restraint do? 33\n\np. 89\n\n34\\. Attachment and aversion of the senses for their respective objects are\nnatural: let none come under their sway: they are his foes. 34\n\np. 90\n\n35\\. Better is one\'s own Dharma, (though) imperfect, than the Dharma of\nanother well-performed. Better is death in one\'s own Dharma: the Dharma of\nanother is fraught with fear. 35\n\nArjuna said:\n\n36\\. But by what impelled does man commit sin, though against his wishes, O\nVarshneya, constrained as it were, by force? 36\n\np. 91\n\nThe Blessed Lord said:\n\n37\\. It is desire--it is anger, born of the Rajo-guna: of great craving, and\nof great sin; know this as the foe here (in this world). 37\n\np. 92\n\n38\\. As fire is enveloped by smoke, as a mirror by dust, as an embryo by the\nsecundine, so is it covered by that. 38\n\n39\\. Knowledge is covered by this, the constant foe of the wise, O son of\nKunti, the unappeasable fire of desire. 39\n\np. 93\n\n40\\. The senses, the mind and the intellect are said to be its abode: through\nthese, it deludes the embodied by veiling his wisdom. 40\n\np. 94\n\n41\\. Therefore, O Bull of the Bharata race, controlling the senses at the\noutset, kill it,--the sinful, the destroyer of knowledge and realisation.\n\n42\\. The senses are said to be superior (to the body); the mind is superior to\nthe senses; the intellect is superior to the mind; and that which is superior\nto the intellect is He (the Atman).\n\n43\\. Thus, knowing Him who is superior to the intellect, and restraining\n\np. 95\n\nthe self by the Self, destroy, O mighty-armed, that enemy, the unseizable foe,\ndesire.\n\n\n\nThe end of the third chapter, designated The Way of Action.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[73:3](sbg08.htm#fr_67) _Meditative_ --those who prefer meditation to external\naction.\n\n_Active_ --those who believe in external work with or without meditation.\n\n[74:4](sbg08.htm#fr_68) Worklessness and perfection: These are synonymous\nterms, meaning, becoming one with the Infinite and free from all ideas of\nwant. A man who has reached this state can have no necessity or desire for\nwork as a means to an end. Perfect satisfaction in the Self is his natural\ncondition. (Vide III. 17.)\n\n[74:5](sbg08.htm#fr_69) _All are made to act:_ All men living under bondage.\n\n[76:9](sbg08.htm#fr_71) _Yajna:_ means a religious rite, sacrifice, worship:\nOr an action done with a good or spiritual motive. It also means the Deity.\nThe Taittiriya-Samhita (I. 7. 4.) says, "Yajna is Vishnu Himself."\n\n[76:*](sbg08.htm#fr_70) See comment on V. 13.\n\n[77:10](sbg08.htm#fr_72) _Praj apati_--the creator or Brahma.\n\n[77:11](sbg08.htm#fr_73) _Devas:_ (lit. the shining ones) beings much higher\nthan man in the scale of evolution, who are in charge of cosmic functions.\n\n[78:13](sbg08.htm#fr_74) _Deva-Yajna:_ offering sacrifices to the gods,\n_Brahma-Yajna:_ teaching and reciting the Scriptures, _Pitri-Yajna:_ offering\nlibations of water to one\'s p. 79 ancestors, _Nri-Yajna:_ the feeding of the\nhungry, and _Bhuta-Yajna:_ the feeding of the lower animals;--are the five\ndaily duties enjoined on householders. The performance of these duties frees\nthem from the fivefold sin, inevitable to a householder\'s life, due to the\nkilling of life, from the use of, (1) the pestle and mortar, (2) the grinding-\nstone, (3) the oven, (4) the water-jar, and (5) the broom.\n\n[79:14](sbg08.htm#fr_75) _Yajna:_ Here it denotes not the sacrificial deeds\nthemselves but the subtle principle, into which they are converted, after they\nhave been performed, to appear, later on, as their fruits. This is technically\nknown as Apurva.\n\n_Karma_ or sacrificial deeds prescribed in the Vedas.\n\n[80:15](sbg08.htm#fr_76) _All-pervading Veda:_ because it illumines all\nsubjects and is the store of all knowledge, being the out-breathing of the\nOmniscient. It is said to be ever centred in Yajna, because it deals chiefly\nwith Yajna, as the means of achieving the end, either of prosperity or final\nliberation, according as it is performed with or without desire.\n\n[80:16](sbg08.htm#fr_77) The _wheel_ of action started by Prajapati on the\nbasis of Veda and sacrifice.\n\n[82:20](sbg08.htm#fr_78) _Guidance of men:_ the Sanskrit word means, gathering\nof men,--that is, into the right path.\n\n[86:28](sbg08.htm#fr_79) _With true insight etc.:_ Knowing the truth that the\nSelf is distinct from all Gunas, and actions.\n\n[86:29](sbg08.htm#fr_80) p. 87 _Those of imperfect knowledge_ --those who can\nonly see as far as the immediate effect of actions.\n\n[87:31](sbg08.htm#fr_81) _Shraddh a:_ is a mental attitude constituted\nprimarily of sincerity of purpose, humility, reverence and faith. You have\nShraddha for your Guru--it p. 88 is sincere reverence. You have Shraddha for\nthe Gita --it is admiration for those of its teachings you understand and\nfaith in those that you do not. You give alms to a beggar with Shraddha--it is\na sense of humility combined with the hope that what you give will be\nacceptable and serviceable.\n\n[88:33](sbg08.htm#fr_82) p. 89 The reason why some people do not follow the\nteaching of the Lord is explained here: Their (lower) nature proves too strong\nfor them.\n\n[89:34](sbg08.htm#fr_83) _His:_ of the seeker after truth.\n\nThough, as has been said in the foregoing Sloka, some are so completely under\nthe sway of their natural propensities, that restraint is of no avail to them,\nyet the seeker after truth should never think of following their example, but\nshould always exert himself to overrule all attachment and aversion of the\nsenses for their objects.\n\n[90:35](sbg08.htm#fr_84) The implication is that Arjuna\'s thought of desisting\nfrom fight and going in for the calm and peaceful life of the Brahman is\npromoted by man\'s natural desire to shun what is disagreeable and embrace what\nis agreeable to the senses. He should on no account yield to this weakness.\n\n[90:36](sbg08.htm#fr_85) p. 91 _V arshneya:_ a descendant of the race of\nVrishni.\n\n[91:37](sbg08.htm#fr_86) _It is desire etc.:_ anger is only another form of\ndesire,--desire obstructed. (See Note, II. 62-63).\n\n[92:38](sbg08.htm#fr_87) " _It_ " is knowledge, and " _that_ " is desire, as\nexplained in the following Sloka.\n\nThree stages of the overclouding of knowledge or Self by desire are described\nby the three illustrations here given. The first stage is Sattvika,--fire\nenveloped by smoke:--the rise of a slight wind of discrimination dispels the\nsmoke of desire in a Sattvika heart. The second, the Rajasika,--the dust on a\nmirror, requires some time and preparation. While the third,--the Tamasika,\ntakes a much longer time, like the release of the embryo from the afterbirth.\n\n[92:39](sbg08.htm#fr_88) Desire is undoubtedly the foe of all mankind. Why it\nis said to be the constant foe of the wise, is p. 93 that they _feel_ it to be\nso even when under its sway. Fools are awakened for a moment only, when they\nsuffer from its painful reactions.\n\n[93:40](sbg08.htm#fr_89) Like a wise general, Krishna points out the fortress\nof the enemy, by conquering which the enemy is easily defeated.\n\n_Through these:_ by vitiating the senses, mind and the intellect.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Fourth Chapter.
