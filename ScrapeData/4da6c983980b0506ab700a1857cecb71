IV.\n\nDivision of the Veda, in the last Dwapara age, by the Vyasa Krishn\xcc\x81a\nDwaipayana. Paila made reader of the Rich; Vai\xc5\x9bampayana of the Yajush; Jaimini\nof the Shun; and Sumantu of the Atharvan. Suta appointed to teach the\nhistorical poems. Origin of the four parts of the Veda. Sanhitas of the Rig-\nveda.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--The original Veda, in four parts, consisted of one hundred thousand\nstanzas; and from it sacrifice of ten kinds 1, the accomplisher of all\ndesires, proceeded. In the twenty-eighth Dwapara age my son Vyasa separated\nthe four portions of the Veda into four Vedas. In the same manner as the Vedas\nwere arranged by him, as Vedavyasa, so were they divided in former periods by\nall the preceding Vyasas, and by myself: and the branches into which they were\nsubdivided by him were the same into which they had been distributed in every\naggregate of the four ages. Know, Maitreya, the Vyasa called Krishn\xcc\x81a\nDwaipayana to be the deity Narayan\xcc\x81a; for who else on this earth could have\ncomposed the Mahabharata 2? Into what portions the Vedas were arranged by my\nmagnanimous son, in the Dwapara age, you shall hear.\n\nWhen Vyasa was enjoined by Brahma to arrange the Vedas in different books, he\ntook four persons, well read in those works, as his disciples. He appointed\nPaila reader of the Rich 3; Vai\xc5\x9bampayana of\n\np. 276\n\nthe Yajush; and Jaimini of the Soma-veda: and Sumantu, who was conversant with\nthe Atharva-veda, was also the disciple of the learned Vyasa. He also took\nSuta, who was named Lomaharshan\xcc\x81a, as his pupil in historical and legendary\ntraditions 4.\n\nThere was but one Yajur-veda; but dividing this into four parts, Vyasa\ninstituted the sacrificial rite that is administered by four kinds of priests:\nin which it was the duty of the Adhwaryu to recite the prayers (Yajush) (or\ndirect the ceremony); of the Hotri, to repeat the hymns (Richas); of the\nUdgatri, to chaunt other hymns (Sama); and of the Brahman, to pronounce the\nformulae called Atharva. Then the Muni, having collected together the hymns\ncalled Richas, compiled the Rigveda; with the prayers and directions termed\nYajushas he formed the Yajur-veda; with those called Sama, Sama-veda; and with\nthe Atharvas he composed the rules of all the ceremonies suited to kings, and\nthe function of the Brahman agreeably to practice 5.\n\np. 277\n\nThis vast original tree of the Vedas, having been divided by him into four\nprincipal stems, soon branched out into an extensive forest. In the first\nplace, Paila divided the Rig-veda, and gave the two Sanhitas (or collections\nof hymns) to Indrapramati and to Bashkali. Bashkali 6 subdivided his Sanhita\ninto four, which he gave to his disciples Baudhya, Agnimat\xcc\x81hara, Yajnawalka,\nand Para\xc5\x9bara; and they taught these secondary shoots from the primitive\nbranch. Indrapramati imparted his Sanhita to his son Man\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ukeya, and it\nthence descended through successive generations, as well as disciples 7.\nVedamitra, called also \xc5\x9aakalya, studied the same Sanhita, but he divided it\ninto five Sanhitas, which he distributed amongst as many disciples, named\nseverally Mudgala, Goswalu, Vatsya, \xc5\x9aaliya, and \xc5\x9ai\xc5\x9bira 8. Sakapurn\xcc\x81i made a\ndifferent division of the original Sanhita into three portions, and added a\nglossary (Nirukta), constituting a fourth 9. The three Sanhitas were given to\nhis three pupils, Krauncha,\n\np. 278\n\n[paragraph continues] Vaitalaki, and Valaka; and a fourth, (thence named)\nNiruktakrit, had the glossary 10. In this way branch sprang from branch.\nAnother Bashkali 11 composed three other Sanhitas, which he taught to his\ndisciples Kalayani, Gargya, and Kathajava 12. These are they by whom the\nprincipal divisions of the Rich have been promulgated 13.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[275:1](vp078.htm#fr_787) According to the Grihya portion of the Sama-veda,\nthere are five great sacrificial ceremonies; 1. Agnihotra, burnt-offerings, or\nlibations of clarified butter on sacred fire; 2. Der\xc5\x9bapaurn\xcc\x81amasa, sacrifices\nat new and full moon; 3. Chaturmasya, sacrifices every four months; 4. Pa\xc5\x9bu-\nyajna or A\xc5\x9bwamedha, sacrifice of a horse or animal; and 5. Soma-yajna,\nofferings and libations of the juice of the acid asclepias. These, again, are\neither Prakrita, \'simple,\' or Vaikrita, \'modified;\' and being thus doubled,\nconstitute ten.\n\n[275:2](vp078.htm#fr_788) The composition of the Mahabharata is always\nascribed to the Vyasa named Krishn\xcc\x81a Dwaipayana, the cotemporary of the events\nthere described. The allusion in the text establishes the priority of the poem\nto the Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a.\n\n[275:3](vp078.htm#fr_789) Or rather, \'he took Paila as teacher.\' The\nexpression is, Rigveda \xc5\x9bravakam Pailam jagraha. \xc5\x9aravaka means properly \'he who\ncauses to hear,\' \'a lecturer,\' \'a preacher;\' although, as in the case of its\napplicability to the laity of the Buddhists and Jainas, it p. 276 denotes a\ndisciple. The commentator however observes, that the text is sometimes read\n\'one who had gone through the Rig-veda.\' So in the preceding verse it is said,\n\'he took four persons, well read in the Vedas, as his disciples,\' and again it\nis said, \'Sumantu, conversant with the Atharva-veda, was his disciple.\' It is\nclear, therefore, that the Vedas were known, as distinct works, before\nKrishn\xcc\x81a Dwaipayana; and it is difficult to understand how he earned his title\nof arranger, or Vyasa: at any rate, in undertaking to give order to the\nprayers and hymns of which the Vedas consist, Paila and the others were rather\nhis coadjutors than disciples; and it seems probable that the tradition\nrecords the first establishment of a school, of which the Vyasa was the head,\nand the other persons named were the teachers.\n\n[276:4](vp078.htm#fr_790) The Itihasa and Puran\xcc\x81as; understanding by the\nformer, legendary and traditional narratives. It is usually supposed that by\nthe Itihasa the Mahabharata is especially meant; but although this poem is\nascribed to Krishn\xcc\x81a Dwaipayana, the recitation of it is not attributed to his\npupil, Roma or Loma-harshan\xcc\x81a: it was first narrated by Vai\xc5\x9bampayana, and\nafter him by Sauti, the son of Lomaharshan\xcc\x81a.\n\n[276:5](vp078.htm#fr_791) From this account, which is repeated in the Vayu P.,\nit appears that the original Veda was the Yajush, or in other words was a\nmiscellaneous body of precepts, formulae, prayers, and hymns, for sacrificial\nceremonies; Yajush being derived by the grammarians from Yaj, \'to worship.\'\nThe derivation of the Vayu Puran\xcc\x81a, however, is from Yuj, \'to join,\' \'to\nemploy;\' the formulae being those especially applied to sacrificial rites, or\nset apart for that purpose from the general collection: p. 277 ### again, ###\nThe commentator on the text however, citing the former of these passages from\nthe Vayu, reads it, confining the derivation to Yaj, \'to worship.\' The\nconcluding passage, relating to the Atharvan, refers, in regard to regal\nceremonies, to those of expiation, \xc5\x9aanti, &c. The function of the Brahman is\nnot explained; but from the preceding specification of the four orders of\npriests who repeat at sacrifices portions of the several Vedas, it relates to\nthe office of the one that is termed specifically the Brahman: so the Vayu has\n\'He constituted the function of the Brahman at sacrifices with the Atharva-\nveda.\'\n\n[277:6](vp078.htm#fr_792) Both in our text and in that of the Vayu this name\noccurs both Bashkala and Bashkali. Mr. Colebrooke writes it Bahkala and\nBahkali. As. Res. VIII. 374.\n\n[277:7](vp078.htm#fr_793) The Vayu supplies the detail. Man\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ukeya, or, as\none copy writes, Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya, taught the Sanhita to his son Satya\xc5\x9bravas; he\nto his son Satyahita; and he to his son Satya\xc5\x9bri. The latter had three pupils,\n\xc5\x9aakalya, also called Devamitra (sic in MS.), Rathantara, and another Bashkali,\ncalled also Bharadwaja. The Vayu has a legend of \xc5\x9aakalya\'s death, in\nconsequence of his being defeated by Yajnavalkya in a disputation at a\nsacrifice celebrated by Janaka.\n\n[277:8](vp078.htm#fr_794) These names in the Vayu are Mudgala, Golaka,\nKhaliya, Matsya, \xc5\x9aai\xc5\x9bireya.\n\n[277:9](vp078.htm#fr_795) The commentator, who is here followed by Mr.\nColebrooke, states that he was a pupil of Indrapramati; but from the Vayu it\nappears that \xc5\x9aakapurn\xcc\x81i was another name of Rathantara, the pupil of Satya\xc5\x9bri,\nthe author of three Sanhitas and a Nirukta, or glossary; whence Mr. Colebrooke\nsupposes him the same with Yaska. As. Res. VIII. 375. It is highly probable\nthat the text of the Vayu may be made to correct that of the Vishn\xcc\x81u in this\nplace, which is inaccurate, notwithstanding the copies agree: they read, ###.\np. 278 Here \xc5\x9aakapurn\xcc\x81ir-atha-itaram is the necessary construction; but quere\nif it should not be \xc5\x9aakapurn\xcc\x81i Rathantara. The parallel passage in the Vayu\nis, ###. Now in describing the pupils of Satya\xc5\x9bri, Rathantara was named\nclearly enough: ###. In another passage it would seem to be implied that this\nBashkali was the author of the Sanhitas, and Rathantara of the Nirukta only:\n###. However this may be, his being the author of the Nirukta identifies him\nwith \xc5\x9aakapurn\xcc\x81i, and makes it likely that the two names should come in juxta-\nposition in our text, as well as in the Vayu. It must be admitted, however,\nthat there are some rather inexplicable repetitions in the part of the Vayu\nwhere this account occurs, although two copies agree in the reading. That a\nportion of the Vedas goes by the name of Rathantara we have seen ([p.\n42](vp039.htm#page_42)); but as far as is yet known, the name is confined to\ndifferent prayers or hymns of the Uhya Gana of the Sama-veda. The text of the\nVishn\xcc\x81u also admits of a different explanation regarding the work of\n\xc5\x9aakapurn\xcc\x81i, and instead of a threefold division of the original, the passage\nmay mean that he composed a third Sanhita. So Mr. Colebrooke says "the Vishn\xcc\x81u\nP. omits the \xc5\x9aakhas of A\xc5\x9bwalayana and Sankhyayana, and intimates that\n\xc5\x9aakapurn\xcc\x81i gave the third varied edition from that of Indrapramati." The Vayu,\nhowever, is clear in ascribing three Sanhitas or \xc5\x9aakhas to \xc5\x9aakapurn\xcc\x81i.\n\n[278:10](vp078.htm#fr_796) In the Vayu the four pupils of Sakapurn\xcc\x81i are\ncalled Kenava, Dalaki, \xc5\x9aatavalaka, and Naigama.\n\n[278:11](vp078.htm#fr_797) This Bashkali may either be, according to the\ncommentator, the pupil of Paila, who, in addition to the four Sanhitas\npreviously noticed, compiled three others; or he may be another Bashkali, a\nfellow-pupil of \xc5\x9aakapurni. The Vayu makes him a disciple of Satya\xc5\x9bri, the\nfellow-pupil of \xc5\x9aakalya and Rathantara, and adds the name or title Bharadwaja.\n\n[278:12](vp078.htm#fr_798) In the Vayu they are called Nandayaniya, Pannagari,\nand \xc3\x81rjjava.\n\n[278:13](vp078.htm#fr_799) Both the Vishn\xcc\x81u and Vayu Puran\xcc\x81as omit two other\nprincipal divisions of the Rich, those of A\xc5\x9bwalayana and Sankhyayana or the\nKau\xc5\x9bitaki. As. Res. VIII. 375. There is no specification of the aggregate\nnumber of Sanhitas of the Rich in our text, or in the Vayu; but they describe\neighteen, including the Nirukta; or as Mr. Colebrooke states, sixteen (As.\nRes. VIII. 374); that is, omitting the two portions of the original, as\ndivided by Paila. The Kurma Puran\xcc\x81a states the number at twenty-one; but\ntreatises on the study of the Vedas reduce the \xc5\x9aakhas of the Rich to five.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter V](vp079.htm)\n\n'
