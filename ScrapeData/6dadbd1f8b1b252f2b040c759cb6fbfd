This\ndialogue is interwoven with others, which are repeated as having been held on\nother occasions between different individuals, in consequence of similar\nquestions having been asked. The immediate narrator is commonly, though not\nconstantly, Lomaharshan\xcc\x81a or Romaharshan\xcc\x81a, the disciple of Vyasa, who is\nsupposed to communicate what was imparted to him by his preceptor, as he had\nheard it from some other sage. Vyasa, as will be seen in the body of the work\n19, is a generic title, meaning an 'arranger' or 'compiler.' It is in this age\napplied to Krishn\xcc\x81a Dwaipayana,\n\np. xi\n\nthe son of Para\xc5\x9bara, who is said to have taught the Vedas and Puran\xcc\x81as to\nvarious disciples, but who appears to have been the head of a college or\nschool, under whom various learned men gave to the sacred literature of the\nHindus the form in which it now presents itself. In this task the disciples,\nas they are termed, of Vyasa were rather his colleagues and coadjutors, for\nthey were already conversant with what he is fabled to have taught them 20;\nand amongst them, Lomaharshan\xcc\x81a represents the class of persons who were\nespecially charged with the record of political and temporal events. He is\ncalled Suta, as if it was a proper name; but it is more correctly a title; and\nLomaharshan\xcc\x81a was 'a Suta,' that is, a bard or panegyrist, who was created,\naccording to our text 21, to celebrate the exploits of princes; and who,\naccording to the Vayu and Padma Puran\xcc\x81as, has a right by birth and profession\nto narrate the Puran\xcc\x81as, in preference even to the Brahmans 22. It is not\nunlikely therefore that we are to understand, by his being represented as the\ndisciple of Vyasa, the institution of some attempt, made under the direction\nof the latter, to collect from the heralds and annalists of his day the\nscattered traditions which they had imperfectly preserved; and hence the\nconsequent appropriation of the Puran\xcc\x81as, in a great measure, to the\ngenealogies of regal dynasties, and descriptions of the universe. However this\nmay be, the machinery has been but loosely adhered to, and many of the\nPatinas, like the Vishn\xcc\x81u, are referred to a different narrator.\n\nAn account is given in the following work 23 of a series of Pauran\xcc\x81ik\ncompilations, of which in their present form no vestige appears. Lomaharshan\xcc\x81a\nis said to have had six disciples, three of whom composed as many fundamental\nSanhitas, whilst he himself compiled a fourth. By a Sanhita is generally\nunderstood a 'collection' or 'compilation.' The Sanhitas of the Vedas are\ncollections of hymns and prayers belonging to them, arranged according to the\njudgment of some individual sage, who is therefore looked upon as the\noriginator and teacher of each. The Sanhitas of the Puran\xcc\x81as, then, should be\nanalogous compilations, attributed respectively to Mitrayu, \xc5\x9aan\xc5\x9bapayana,\nAkritavran\xcc\x81a, and Romaharshan\xcc\x81a: no such Pauran\xcc\x81ik Sanhitas are now known, The\n\np. xii\n\nsubstance of the four is said to be collected in the Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a, which is\nalso, in another place 24, itself called a Sanhita: but such compilations have\nnot, as far as inquiry has yet proceeded, been discovered. The specification\nmay be accepted as an indication of the Puran\xcc\x81as having existed in some other\nform, in which they are no longer met with; although it does not appear that\nthe arrangement was incompatible with their existence as separate works, for\nthe Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a, which is our authority for the four Sanhitas, gives us\nalso the usual enumeration of the several Puran\xcc\x81as.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[x:19](vp003.htm#fr_18) [p. 272](vp077.htm#page_272).\n\n[xi:20](vp003.htm#fr_19) See P.
