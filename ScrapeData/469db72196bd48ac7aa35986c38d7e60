To the Military man this language is of\nspecial use, as it not only enables him thoroughly to understand his men on\npoints of common occurrence and of duty; but by being able to converse freely\nwith them, to study their habits, manners, customs, their general turn of\nthought and opinions.\n\nThe Hindee of the PREM SAGUR is remarkably pure, and the book is, I believe,\nan Examination Book at all the Presidencies.\n\nW.
