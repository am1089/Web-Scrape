He who even for (the space of) a\n(single) exhalation, at the time of the termination (of life 5) becomes\nequable 6, attaining to the self, becomes fit for immortality. Restraining the\nself in the self 7, even for (the space of) a wink, he repairs to the\ninexhaustible acquisition 8 of those who have knowledge, through the\ntranquillity of the self 9. And restraining the life-winds again and\n\np. 373\n\nagain by control of the life-winds 1, of ten or twelve 2 (modes), (he repairs\nto) that which is beyond the twenty-four 3. Thus having first a tranquil self,\nbe obtains whatever he desires. When the quality of goodness predominates in\nthe unperceived 4, that fits one for immortality. The men of knowledge extol\nnothing else beyond goodness. By inference 5 we understand the (attainment to\nthe) being to depend on goodness. It is not possible otherwise 6 to attain to\nthat being, O best of the twice-born! Forgiveness, courage, harmlessness,\nequability, truth, straightforwardness, knowledge, abandonment 7, and also\nrenunciation are laid down as (constituting) conduct\n\np. 374\n\nof the quality of goodness. By this very inference the wise verily believe in\nthe Being and nature as one, there is no doubt of that. Some learned. men, who\nare devoted to knowledge, assert the unity of the Kshetra _g_ \xc3\xb1a and nature 1.\nBut that is not correct. That they are always distinct (from one another) is\nalso (said) without (due) consideration 2. Distinction and also association 3\nshould be accurately understood. Unity and diversity 4 are likewise laid down.\nSuch is the doctrine of the learned. Between the gnat and the udumbara 5 there\nis observed unity and diversity also. As a fish is in water distinct (from\nit), such is their relation; (such is) the relation of the drops of water with\nthe leaf of the lotus.\n\nThe preceptor said:\n\nThen those Brahma _n_ as, who were the best of sages, having again felt\ndoubts, interrogated the grandsire of the people who spoke to them thus.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[372:1](sbe0859.htm#fr_1926) See [p. 351](sbe0855.htm#page_351) supra.\n\n[372:2](sbe0859.htm#fr_1927) See Gita, [p. 109](sbe0816.htm#page_109).\n\n[372:3](sbe0860.htm#fr_1928) As to the first two clauses comp. pp.\n[284](sbe0838.htm#page_284)-[371](sbe0859.htm#page_371) supra; the last two\nare said by Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra to represent the Sa _n_ khya and Yoga\ndoctrines respectively.\n\n[372:4](sbe0860.htm#fr_1929) I presume this means all teachers. But Nilaka\n_nth_ a takes it to mean the Sa _n_ khyas, and he takes the preceding words as\nindicating two views based on _S_ ruti texts, viz. the first, that the world\nis a development of the Brahman, and the other that the Brahman does not\nundergo any development or change. Anamaya he takes to mean changeless, and\nBrahmamaya he takes to mean developed from the Brahman.\n\n[372:5](sbe0860.htm#fr_1930) Cf. Gita, pp. [77](sbe0809.htm#page_77),\n[78](sbe0810.htm#page_78).\n\n[372:6](sbe0860.htm#fr_1931) One who sees the supreme as the only real entity,\nAr _g_ una Mi _s_ ra. Nilaka _nth_ a takes it to mean one who identifies\nhimself with everything. See Gita, [p. 65](sbe0807.htm#page_65), and note\n[4](sbe0805.htm#fn_172) there.\n\n[372:7](sbe0860.htm#fr_1932) See [p. 344](sbe0854.htm#page_344) supra.\n\n[372:8](sbe0860.htm#fr_1933) I. e. the goal to be acquired.\n\n[372:9](sbe0860.htm#fr_1934) 'Tranquillity'--the original may also be rendered\nby 'favour,' p. 373 as to which cf. [p. 234](sbe0828.htm#page_234) supra, but\nfurther on the phrase 'having a tranquil self' occurs, where the latter sense\nis not quite suitable. See Gita, [p. 51](sbe0804.htm#page_51), and Yoga-sutra\nI, 33.\n\n[373:1](sbe0860.htm#fr_1935) I. e. the specific modes which are mentioned of\ncontrol of life-winds, e. g. at Gita, [p. 61](sbe0806.htm#page_61), or Yoga-\nsutra II, 49 seq.\n\n[373:2](sbe0860.htm#fr_1936) Nilaka _nth_ a proposes two interpretations of\nthis. He says the ten are the eight mentioned in Yoga-sutra II, 29, and in\naddition tarka and vairagya (as to which see Yoga-sutra I, 15 and 17). To make\nup the twelve he substitutes for the last two the four named at Yoga-sutra I,\n33. He also suggests that 'ten or twelve' may mean twenty-two, which he makes\nup thus. The five modes of yama (Yoga-sutra II, 30), five of niyama (ibid.\n32), the remaining six in Yoga-sutra II, 29, the four in Yoga-sutra I, 33, and\ntarka and vairagya as before.\n\n[373:3](sbe0860.htm#fr_1937) The twenty-four are the elements according to the\nSankhya system. See Sa _n_ khya-sara, p. 11, and [p.\n368](sbe0858.htm#page_368) supra. That which is beyond them is Purusha.\n\n[373:4](sbe0860.htm#fr_1938) The unperceived, it should be noted, is made up\nof the three qualities; the predominance of goodness indicates enlightenment\nor knowledge. Cf. Gita, [p. 108](sbe0816.htm#page_108).\n\n[373:5](sbe0860.htm#fr_1939) The middle term in the inference being, says Ar\n_g_ una Mi _s_ ra, the enlightening effect of the quality in question.\n\n[373:6](sbe0860.htm#fr_1940) Cf. [p. 167](sbe0824.htm#page_167) supra.\n\n[373:7](sbe0860.htm#fr_1941) The original is tyaga, which Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra\nrenders by 'abandonment of all belongings;' renunciation, scil. of fruit. Cf.\nGita, [p. 121](sbe0819.htm#page_121), and [p. 114](sbe0817.htm#page_114).\n\n[374:1](sbe0860.htm#fr_1942) Here, says Nilaka _nth_ a, the author indicates\nan objection to the proposition stated just before. But the passage is not\nclear.\n\n[374:2](sbe0860.htm#fr_1943) This, says Nilaka _nth_ a, is a reply to the Sa\n_n_ khyas, who hold the two to be distinct. Nilaka _nth_ a adds, that if the\ntwo are distinct, nature will, conceivably, adhere even to an emancipated\ncreature; and if they are one, then the being or self would be really engaging\nin action and so forth, and that activity being really a property of the self,\ncould not be destroyed save by the destruction of the self. Hence that view is\nalso wrong.\n\n[374:3](sbe0860.htm#fr_1944) Like that of sea and wave, Nilaka _nth_ a.\n\n[374:4](sbe0860.htm#fr_1945) Unity of Brahman and diversity of manifestation\nor nature, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, who adds--by reason of the association they\nare spoken of as one, by reason of the unity and diversity they are distinct.\nThe next sentence contains three parallel cases.\n\n[374:5](sbe0860.htm#fr_1946) Cf. as to all this, _S_ anti Parvan, chap. 194,\nst. 38 seq. (Moksha Dharma); chap. 249, st. 20 seq.; chap. 285, st. 33 seq.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXXIV](sbe0861.htm)\n\n"
