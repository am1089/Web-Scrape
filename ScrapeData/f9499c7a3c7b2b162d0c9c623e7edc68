On a day on which the moon stands in conjunction with a Nakshatra (that\nhas a name) of masculine gender, on that day, after having caused (his wife)\nto fast, to bathe, and to put on two garments which have not yet been washed,\nand after having in the night-time crushed in water descending roots and\nshoots of a Nyagrodha tree, he inserts (that into her right nostril) as above,\nwith the two (verses),\n\np. 292\n\n[paragraph continues] 'The gold-child' (Va _g_.

I place no confidence in this statement,\nthough I cannot show at present what its origin is. I am not sure about the\ntranslation of vik _ri_ tya (or vik _ri_ tya?).

'Steps of Vish _n_ u' is\na name for the Ya _g_ us following in the Sa _m_ hita on the one prescribed in\nthis Sutra. It begins, 'Vish _n_ u\xc2\x92s step art thou, &c.' (Va _g_. Sa _m_ h.\nXII, 5).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 15](sbe29169.htm)\n\n"
