The gods were once performing the initiation ceremony for a\n(sacrificial session) of a thousand years. When five hundred years had passed\nwith them, everything here was worn out--to wit, Stomas, and P _ri_ sh _th_\nas, and metres (texts).\n\n12:3:3:22\\. The gods then perceived that unexhausted element of the sacrifice,\nand by means of that unexhausted element they obtained what success there was\nin the Veda; and, verily, for him who thus knows this, the Vedas are\nunexhausted, and the work of the officiating priests is pet-formed with the\nunexhausted threefold science.\n\n12:3:3:33\\. Now, this is that unexhausted element of the sacrifice:--o- _s_\nravaya, astu _s_ rausha _t_ , ya _g_ a, ye ya _g_ amahe, and vausha _t_  2. In\nthese five utterances there are seventeen syllables:--o- _s_ ravaya consists\nof four syllables, astu _s_ rausha _t_ of four syllables, ya _g_ a of two\nsyllables, ye ya _g_ amahe of five syllables;\n\n12:3:3:44\\. And the Vasha _t_ -call consists of two syllables. This is the\nseventeenfold Pra _g_ apati, as established in the deity and in the body, and,\nverily, whosoever thus knows that seventeenfold Pra _g_ apati, as established\nin the deity and in the body, establishes himself by offspring and cattle in\nthis, and by immortality in the other, world.\n\np. 171\n\n12:3:3:55\\. The gods then spake, 'Find ye out that sacrificial performance\nwhich shall be a substitute for one of a thousand years; for what man is equal\nthereto that he could get through with (a performance of) a thousand years?'\n\n12:3:3:66\\. They saw the Vi _s_ va _g_ it with all the P _ri_ sh _th_ as 1 to\nbe an accelerated Soma-feast in lien of the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya-sha _d_ aha, for\nthere are those (same) Stomas, those P _ri_ sh _th_ as, and those metres.\n\n12:3:3:77\\. They saw the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya-sha _d_ aha to be an accelerated\nSoma-feast in lieu of the Dvada _s_ aha, for there are those (same) Stomas,\nthose P _ri_ sh _th_ as, and those metres 2.\n\n12:3:3:88\\. They saw the Dvada _s_ aha to be an accelerated Soma-feast in lieu\nof (a session of) a year 3, for there are those (same) Stomas, those P _ri_ sh\n_th_ as, and those metres.\n\n12:3:3:99\\. They saw the (session of a) year to be an accelerated Soma-feast\nin lieu of the Tapa _s_ _k_ ita 4, for there are those (same) Stomas, those P\n_ri_ sh _th_ as, and those metres.\n\n12:3:3:1010\\. They saw the Tapa _s_ _k_ ita to be an accelerated Soma-feast in\nlieu of the thousand years' performance, for there are those (same) Stomas,\nthose P _ri_ sh _th_ as, and those metres.\n\n12:3:3:1111\\. He passes a year with the rites of initiation,\n\np. 172\n\na year with the Upasads, and a year with the pressings of Soma.\n\n12:3:3:1212\\. When he passes a year with the rites of initiation he thereby\nsecures for himself the first part of the performance of a thousand years; and\nwhen he passes a year with the Upasads he thereby secures for himself the\ncentral part of the performance of a thousand years; and when he passes a year\nwith the pressings he thereby secures for himself the last part of the\nperformance of a thousand years.\n\n12:3:3:1313\\. Twelve months he passes with the rites of initiation, twelve\nwith the Upasads, and twelve with the pressings,--that makes thirty-six. Now\nthe B _ri_ hati (metre) consists of thirty-six syllables, and by means of the\nB _ri_ hati the gods strove to reach heaven, and by means of the B _ri_ hati\nthey indeed attained heaven; and in like manner does this one, by means of the\nB _ri_ hati, now strive to reach heaven, and by means of the B _ri_ hati he\nindeed attains heaven; and whatever object of desire there is in the B _ri_\nhati, that he thereby secures for himself.\n\n12:3:3:1414\\. But, indeed, there is that triad that is performed together,--\nthe Agni (fire-altar), the Arkya, and the Mahad Uktham (great litany). When he\npasses a year with the rites of initiation, and a year with the Upasads,\nthereby the Agni and the Arka are secured by him; and when he passes a year\nwith the pressings, thereby the Mahad Uktham is secured by him: this, then, to\nwit, the Tapa _s_ _k_ ita, is the substitute for the performance of a thousand\nyears, and this, to wit, the Tapa _s_ _k_ ita, conduces to the procreation of\ncreatures.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[170:2](sbe44055.htm#fr_493) For these sacrificial calls, see part i, p. 142,\nnote 2.\n\n[171:1](sbe44055.htm#fr_494) For such a day's performance with all the P _ri_\nsh _th_ a-samans, see part iii, introd., p. xx seq.\n\n[171:2](sbe44055.htm#fr_495) The Dvada _s_ aha, or twelve-days' performance,\nincludes a P _ri_ sh _th_ ya-sha _d_ aha as its second to seventh days.\n\n[171:3](sbe44055.htm#fr_496) The one year's session includes a Da _s_ aratra,\nor ten-days' performance, forming the central part of the Dvada _s_ aha; and\nthe first and last days of the latter being, like those of the Gavam ayanam, a\npraya _n_ iya and udayaniya Atiratra.\n\n[171:4](sbe44055.htm#fr_497) See part iv, p. 317, note 2.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XII, 3, 4.
