Our Chakua sub-treasury looted! A remittance of seven thousand\nfive hundred rupees was due from there to headquarters. The local cashier had\nchanged the cash at the Government Treasury into small currency notes for\nconvenience in carrying, and had kept them ready in bundles. In the middle of\nthe night an armed band had raided the room, and wounded Kasim, the man on\nguard. The curious part of it was that they had taken only six thousand rupees\nand left the rest scattered on the floor, though it would have been as easy to\ncarry that away also. Anyhow, the raid of the dacoits was over; now the police\nraid would begin. Peace was out of the question.\n\nWhen I went inside, I found the news had travelled before me. "What a terrible\nthing, brother," exclaimed the Bara Rani. "Whatever shall we do?"\n\nI made light of the matter to reassure her. "We still have something left," I\nsaid with a smile. "We shall manage to get along somehow."\n\n"Don\'t joke about it, brother dear. Why are they all so angry with you? Can\'t\nyou humour them? Why put everybody out?" "I cannot let the country go to rack\nand ruin, even if that would please everybody."\n\n"That was a shocking thing they did at the burning-grounds. It\'s a horrid\nshame to treat you so. The Chota Rani has got rid of all her fears by dint of\nthe Englishwoman\'s teaching, but as for me, I had to send for the priest to\navert the omen before I could get any peace of mind. For my sake, dear, do get\naway to Calcutta. I tremble to think what they may do, if you stay on here."\n\nMy sister-in-law\'s genuine anxiety touched me deeply.\n\n"And, brother," she went on, "did I not warn you, it was not well to keep so\nmuch money in your room? They might get wind of it any day. It is not the\nmoney--but who knows..."\n\nTo calm her I promised to remove the money to the treasury at once, and then\nget it away to Calcutta with the first escort going. We went together to my\nbedroom. The dressing-room door was shut. When I knocked, Bimala called out:\n"I am dressing."\n\n"I wonder at the Chota Rani," exclaimed my sister-in-law, "dressing so early\nin the day! One of their _Bande Mataram_ meetings, I suppose. Robber Queen!"\nshe called out in jest to Bimala. "Are you counting your spoils inside?"\n\n"I will attend to the money a little later," I said, as I came away to my\noffice room outside.\n\nI found the Police Inspector waiting for me. "Any trace of the dacoits?" I\nasked.\n\n"I have my suspicions."\n\n"On whom?"\n\n"Kasim, the guard."\n\n"Kasim? But was he not wounded?"\n\n"A mere nothing. A flesh wound on the leg. Probably self- inflicted."\n\n"But I cannot bring myself to believe it. He is such a trusted servant."\n\n"You may have trusted him, but that does not prevent his being a thief. Have I\nnot seen men trusted for twenty years together, suddenly developing..."\n\n"Even if it were so, I could not send him to gaol. But why should he have left\nthe rest of the money lying about?"\n\n"To put us off the scent. Whatever you may say, Maharaja, he must be an old\nhand at the game. He mounts guard during his watch, right enough, but I feel\nsure he has a finger in all the dacoities going on in the neighbourhood."\n\nWith this the Inspector proceeded to recount the various methods by which it\nwas possible to be concerned in a dacoity twenty or thirty miles away, and yet\nbe back in time for duty.\n\n"Have you brought Kasim here?" I asked.\n\n"No," was the reply, "he is in the lock-up. The Magistrate is due for the\ninvestigation."\n\n"I want to see him," I said.\n\nWhen I went to his cell he fell at my feet, weeping. "In God\'s name," he said,\n"I swear I did not do this thing."\n\n"I do not doubt you, Kasim," I assured him. "Fear nothing. They can do nothing\nto you, if you are innocent."\n\nKasim, however, was unable to give a coherent account of the incident. He was\nobviously exaggerating. Four or five hundred men, big guns, numberless swords,\nfigured in his narrative. It must have been either his disturbed state of mind\nor a desire to account for his easy defeat. He would have it that this was\nHarish Kundu\'s doing; he was even sure he had heard the voice of Ekram, the\nhead retainer of the Kundus.\n\n"Look here, Kasim," I had to warn him, "don\'t you be dragging other people in\nwith your stories. You are not called upon to make out a case against Harish\nKundu, or anybody else."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIV](hw40.htm)\n\n'
