And, verily, even on this occasion 1, they slaughter the\nsacrificial horse (A _s_ vamedha) as a sacrifice to the gods: of this (New and\nFull-moon sacrifice) they say, 'It is the original (normal) A _s_ vamedha;'\nand that (real A _s_ vamedha), indeed, is just the other (modified one); for,\nindeed, the A _s_ vamedha is the same as the moon.\n\np. 34\n\n11:2:5:22\\. As to this, they say, 'For each foot of the sacrificial horse they\noffer an oblation;'--when he performs the Agnihotra in the evening and\nmorning, he offers two oblations in the evening, and two in the morning--that\nmakes four oblations: thus--the horse being four-footed--an oblation is\noffered for each of its feet.\n\n11:2:5:33\\. As to this, they say, 'On the starting off of the horse he\nperforms an offering 1; for the moon, doubtless, is the same as King Soma, the\nfood of the gods: when, during that night (of new moon), he does not appear\neither in the east or in the west, then he comes to this world, and starts for\nthis world 2.'\n\n11:2:5:44\\. Now, when he performs the New-moon sacrifice, he thereby performs\nthe (same) offering (as) on the starting of that (horse), and when he performs\nthe Full-moon sacrifice he slaughters the sacrificial horse itself, and,\nhaving slaughtered it, he presents it to the gods. The other (real) horse-\nsacrifice they indeed perform (only) a year after (the starting offering), but\nthis month (of the Full and New-moon sacrifice), revolving, makes up a year 3:\nthus the sacrificial horse comes to be slaughtered for him year after year.\n\np. 35\n\n11:2:5:55\\. Verily, then, for him who, knowing this, offers both the Agnihotra\nand the Full and New-moon sacrifices, they slaughter the sacrificial horse\nmonth by month; and month by month the A _s_ vamedha is offered for him, and\nhis Agnihotra and Full and New-moon sacrifices come to pass into the A _s_\nvamedha.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[33:1](sbe44015.htm#fr_147) Viz. in performing the Full and New-moon\nsacrifice, for which all the benefits accruing from the A _s_ vamedha are here\nclaimed.\n\n[34:1](sbe44015.htm#fr_148) According to \xc3\x82 _s_ v. X, 6, 2 seqq., having chosen\nthe horse to be sacrificed, he performs two ish _t_ is, to Agni Murdhanvat and\nPushan; whereupon he sets free the horse, and for a year performs three ish\n_t_ is daily at the three pressings, viz. to Savit _ri_ Satyaprasava, Prasavit\n_ri_ , and \xc3\x82savit _ri_.\n\n[34:2](sbe44015.htm#fr_149) Or, he disappears in this world; the same verb\n(vi-v _ri_ t) being used for the disappearance as for the starting off of the\nhorse when set free.\n\n[34:3](sbe44015.htm#fr_150) The syntactic construction of the last two\nsentences is that frequently alluded to before, viz. that of parenthetic\ncausal clauses.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 2, 6.
