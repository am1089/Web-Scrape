For (the _s_ irovrata) concerns the mode of the study of the Veda; also on\naccount of (that rite) being a heading in the sama _k_ ara; and the\nrestriction is like that of the libations.\n\nWhat the text says as to a restriction connected with the 'vow of the head,'\ndoes not intimate a difference of vidyas. For that vow does not form part of\nthe vidya. The restriction refers only to a peculiarity of the _study_ of the\nVeda on the part of the \xc3\x82tharva _n_ ikas, being meant to establish that they\nshould possess that special qualification which the rite produces; but it does\nnot affect the vidya itself. This is proved by the subsequent clause, 'a man\nwho has not performed that rite may not _read_ the text,' which directly\nconnects the rite with the studying of the text. And it is further proved by\nthe fact that in the book of the \xc3\x82tharva _n_ ikas, called 'sama _k_ ara, 'that\nrite is referred to as a rite connected with the Veda (not with the special\nvidya set forth in the Mu _nd_ aka), viz. in the passage, 'this is explained\nalready by the Veda-observance' (which extends the details of the _s_\nirovrata, there called veda-vrata, to other observances). By the _knowledge of\nBrahman_ (referred to in the Mu _nd_ aka-text 'let a man tell this science of\nBrahman to those only,' &c.), we have therefore to understand knowledge of the\nVeda in general. And that restriction is 'like that of the libations'--i.e. it\nis analogous to the restriction under which the sava-libations, beginning with\nthe Saptasurya-libation, and terminating with the _S_ ataudana-libation, are\noffered in the one fire which is used by the followers of the Atharvan, and\nnot in the ordinary three fires.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 4.
