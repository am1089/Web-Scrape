To six persons the Arghya reception is due: to a teacher, to an\nofficiating priest, to the father-in-law, to the king, to a friend, to a\nSnataka.\n\n2 2-3. They should honour them (with the Arghya reception) once a year.\n\n3\\. But officiating priests (they should receive) whenever they intend to\nperform a sacrifice.\n\n4\\. Having ordered a seat to be got (for the guest), he says, \'Well, sir! sit\ndown! We will do honour to you, sir!\'\n\n5\\. They get for him a couch (of grass) to sit down on, another for the feet,\nwater for washing the feet, the Argha water, water for sipping, and the honey-\nmixture, i.e. curds, honey, and ghee, in a brass vessel with a brass cover.\n\n6 6. Another person three times announces (to the guest) the couch and the\nother things (when they are offered to him).\n\n7\\. He accepts the couch.\n\n8 8. He sits down thereon with (the verse), \'I am the highest one among my\npeople, as the sun among the thunder-bolts. Here I tread on whosoever infests\nme.\'\n\n9 9-10. With the feet (he treads) on the other (bundle of grass).\n\np. 274\n\n10\\. When he is seated on the couch, he washes (for his guest) the left foot\nand then the right foot.\n\n11 11. If (the host) is a Brahma _n_ a, the right first.\n\n12 12. (He does so) with (the formula), \'The milk of Vira _g_ art thou. The\nmilk of Vira _g_ may I obtain. (May) the milk of Padya Vira _g_ (dwell) in\nme.\'\n\n13 13. He accepts the Arghya water with (the words), \'Waters are ye. May I\nobtain through you all my wishes.\'\n\n14\\. Pouring it out he recites over (the waters the formula), \'To the ocean I\nsend you; go back to your source. Unhurt be our men. May my sap not be shed.\'\n\n15\\. He sips water with (the formula), \'Thou camest to me with glory. Unite me\nwith lustre. Make me beloved by all creatures, the lord of cattle, unhurtful\nfor the bodies.\'\n\n16 16. With (the formula), \'With Mitra\xc2\x92s\' (Va _g_. Sa _m_ h., Ka _n_ va _s_\nakha II, 3, 4) he looks at the Madhuparka.\n\n17 17. With (the formula), \'By the impulse of the god Savit _ri_ \' (Va _g_. Sa\n_m_ h. l.l.) he accepts it.\n\n18 18. Taking it into his left hand he stirs it about\n\np. 275\n\nthree times with the fourth finger of his right hand with (the formula),\n\'Adoration to the brown-faced One. What has been damaged in thee, when the\nfood was eaten, that I cut off from thee.\'\n\n19\\. And with the fourth finger and the thumb he spirts away (some part of the\nMadhuparka) three times.\n\n20\\. He partakes of it three times with (the formula), \'What is the honied,\nhighest form of honey, and the enjoyment of food, by that honied, highest form\nof honey, and by that enjoyment of food may I become highest, honied, and an\nenjoyer of food.\'\n\n21 21. Or with (the verses) that contain the word \'honey,\' verse by verse.\n\n22 22. Let him give the remainder (of the Madhuparka) to a son or a pupil who\nis sitting to the north.\n\n23 23. Or let him eat the whole of it (himself).\n\n24 24. Or he should pour out (the remainder) to the east, at an unfrequented\nspot.\n\n25\\. Having sipped water, he touches his bodily organs with (the formula),\n\'May speech dwell in my mouth, breath in my nose, sight in my eyes, hearing in\nmy ears, strength in my arms, vigour in my thighs. May my limbs be unhurt, may\nmy body be united with my body!\'\n\n26\\. When (the guest) has sipped water, (the host), holding a butcher\'s knife,\nsays to him three times, \'A cow!\'\n\n27\\. He replies, \'The mother of the Rudras, the daughter of the Vasus, the\nsister of the \xc3\x82dityas, the\n\np. 276\n\nnavel of immortality. To the people who understand me, I say, "Do not kill the\nguiltless cow, which is Aditi." I kill my sin and N.N.\'s sin,\'\xc2\x97thus, if he\nchooses to have it killed.\n\n28\\. But if he chooses to let it loose, he should say, \'My sin and N.N.\'s sin\nhas been killed. Om! Let it loose! Let it eat grass!\'\n\n29 29-30. But let the Argha not be without flesh.\n\n30\\. On the occasion of a sacrifice and of a wedding let (the guest) say,\n\'Make it (ready).\'\n\n31 31. Even if he performs more than one Soma sacrifice during one year, let\nonly priests who have received (from him) the Arghya reception, officiate for\nhim, not such who have not received it; for this has been prescribed in the\n_S_ ruti.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[273:1](sbe29157.htm#fr_676) 3, 1. On vaivahya, which I have translated\nfather-in-law,\' comp. the note on _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana II, 15, I.\n\n[273:2-3](sbe29157.htm#fr_677) 2, 3. Comp. below, Sutra 31, and _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya II, 15, 10.\n\n[273:6](sbe29157.htm#fr_678) \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana-G _ri_ hya I, 24, 7.\n\n[273:8](sbe29157.htm#fr_679) I have translated according to the reading of \xc3\x82\n_s_ valayana (l.l. \xc2\xa7 8), vidyutam instead of udyatam.\n\n[273:9-10](sbe29157.htm#fr_680) 9, 10. There is no doubt that these Sutras\nshould be divided p. 274 thus: padayor anya _m_. vish _t_ ara asinaya savya\n_m_ pada _m_ prakshalya dakshi _n_ a _m_ prakshalayati. Thus it is said in the\nKhadira-G _ri_ hya: vish _t_ aram astirya . . . adhyasita. padayor dvitiyaya\n(scil. _ri_ _k_ a) dvau _k_ et. Gobhila has the Sutra: padayor anyam.\n\n[274:11](sbe29157.htm#fr_681) The words brahma _n_ a _s_ _k_ et refer to the\nhost, as the comparison of \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana I, 24, 11, shows.\n\n[274:12](sbe29157.htm#fr_682) Comp. \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana l.l. \xc2\xa7 22; _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana\nIII, 7, 5.\n\n[274:13](sbe29157.htm#fr_683) The play on words (apas = waters, avapnavani =\nmay I obtain) is untranslatable.\n\n[274:16](sbe29157.htm#fr_684) \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana-G _ri_ hya I, 24, 14.\n\n[274:17](sbe29157.htm#fr_685) \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana-G _ri_ hya I, 24, 15.\n\n[274:18](sbe29157.htm#fr_686) \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana-G _ri_ hya l.l. Anna _s_ ane\ninstead of anna _s_ ane is simply a mistake in spelling.\n\n[275:21](sbe29157.htm#fr_687) These are the three verses, Va _g_. Sa _m_ hita\nXIII, 27-29.\n\n[275:22](sbe29157.htm#fr_688) \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana-G _ri_ hya I, 24, 25.\n\n[275:23](sbe29157.htm#fr_689) \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana l.l. \xc2\xa7 27.\n\n[275:24](sbe29157.htm#fr_690) \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana l.l. \xc2\xa7 26.\n\n[276:29-30](sbe29157.htm#fr_691) 29, 30. These Sutras are identical with two\nSutras in the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya II, 15, 2.3. See the note there. It\nseems to me inadmissible to translate \xc2\xa7 29, as Professor Stenzler does: Der\nArgha darf aber nicht immer ohne Fleisch sein.\n\n[276:31](sbe29157.htm#fr_692) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya II, 15, 10.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4](sbe29158.htm)\n\n'
