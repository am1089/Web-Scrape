And on account of the non-perception of the\n\np. 296\n\nothers (i.e. the effects of the pradhana, according to the Sa _n_ khya\nsystem).\n\nThe principles different from the pradhana, but to be viewed as its\nmodifications which the (Sa _n_ khya) Sm _ri_ ti assumes, as, for instance,\nthe great principle, are perceived neither in the Veda nor in ordinary\nexperience. Now things of the nature of the elements and the sense organs,\nwhich are well known from the Veda, as well as from experience, may be\nreferred to in Sm _ri_ ti; but with regard to things which, like Kapila's\ngreat principle, are known neither from the Veda nor from experience--no more\nthan, for instance, the objects of a sixth sense--Sm _ri_ ti is altogether\nimpossible. That some scriptural passages which apparently refer to such\nthings as the great principle have in reality quite a different meaning has\nalready been shown under I, 4, 1. But if that part of Sm _ri_ ti which is\nconcerned with the effects (i.e. the great principle, and so on) is without\nauthority, the part which refers to the cause (the pradhana) will be so\nlikewise. This is what the Sutra means to say.--We have thus established a\nsecond reason, proving that the circumstance of there being no room left for\ncertain Sm _ri_ tis does not constitute a valid objection to our doctrine.--\nThe weakness of the trust in reasoning (apparently favouring the Sa _n_ khya\ndoctrine) will be shown later on under II, 1, 4 ff.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1, 3](sbe34142.htm)\n\n"
