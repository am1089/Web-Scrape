And (scripture teaches) the destruction (of the qualification for works,\nby knowledge).\n\nMoreover scripture teaches that this whole apparent world-which springs from\nNescience, is characterised by\n\np. 295\n\nactions, agents and results of actions and is the cause of all qualification\nfor works--is essentially destroyed by the power of knowledge. Compare such\npassages as 'But when all has become the Self of him, wherewith should he see\nanother, wherewith should he smell another?' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 5, 15). For him\nnow who should teach that the qualification for works has for its necessary\nantecedent the knowledge of the Self which the Vedanta-texts teach, it would\nfollow that the qualification for works is cut short altogether. From this\nalso it follows that knowledge is independent.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 17](sbe38226.htm)\n\n"
