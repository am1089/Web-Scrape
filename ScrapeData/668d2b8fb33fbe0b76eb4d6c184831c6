I ween, would tame  \nThe vigour of the glorious flame.  \nIf I to cool my fever tried  \nTo cross the deep from side to side.  \nThe sea,--so hard my fate,--would dry  \nHis waters as my feet came nigh.  \nIn all this world there lives not one  \nSo cursed as I beneath the sun;  \nSo strong a net of misery cast  \nAround me holds the captive fast,  \nBest of all birds that play the wing,  \nLoved, honoured by our sire the king,  \nThe vulture, in my fate enwound,  \nLies bleeding, dying on the ground.'  \n   Then Rama and his brother stirred  \n\np. 309  \n\nBy pity mourned the royal bird,  \nAnd, as their hands his limbs caressed,  \nAffection for a sire expressed.  \nAnd Rama to his bosom strained  \nThe bird with mangled wings distained,  \n   With crimson blood-drops dyed.  \nHe fell, and shedding many a tear,  \n   'Where is my spouse than life more dear?  \n     Where is my love?' he cried.  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXIX.: The Death of Jatayus.](ry267.htm)\n\n"
