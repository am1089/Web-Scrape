This (nishkevalya- _s_ astra) becomes perfect as a thousand of B _ri_ hati\nverses.\n\n2\\. Some teachers (belonging to a different Sakha) recognise a thousand of\ndifferent metres (not of B _ri_ hatis only). They say: 'Is another thousand (a\nthousand of other verses) good? Let us say it is good.'\n\n3\\. Some say, a thousand of Trish _t_ ubh verses, others a thousand of _G_\nagati verses, others a thousand of Anush _t_ ubh verses.\n\n4\\. This has been said by a _Ri_ shi (Rv. X, 124, 9):--\n\n5\\. 'Poets through their understanding discovered Indra dancing an Anush _t_\nubh.' This is meant to say: They discovered (and meditated) in speech (called\nAnush _t_ ubh)--at that time (when they worshipped\n\np. 228\n\nthe uktha)--the Pra _n_ a (breath) connected with Indra.\n\n6\\. He (who takes the recited verses as Anush _t_ ubhs) is able to become\ncelebrated and of good report.\n\n7\\. No! he says; rather is such a man liable to die before his time. For that\nself (consisting of Anush _t_ ubhs) is incomplete. For if a man confines\nhimself to speech, not to breath, then driven by his mind, he does not succeed\nwith speech 1.\n\n8\\. Let him work towards the B _ri_ hati, for the B _ri_ hati (breath) is the\ncomplete self.\n\n9\\. That self ( _g_ ivatman) is surrounded on all sides by members. And as\nthat self is on all sides surrounded by members, the B _ri_ hati also is on\nall sides surrounded by metres 2.\n\n10\\. For the self (in the heart) is the middle of these members, and the B\n_ri_ hati is the middle of the metres.\n\n11\\. 'He is able to become celebrated and of good\n\np. 229\n\nreport, but (the other) able to die before his time,' thus he said. For the B\n_ri_ hati is the complete self, therefore let him work towards the B _ri_ hati\n(let him reckon the _s_ astra recitation as a thousand B _ri_ hatis).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[228:1](sbe01218.htm#fr_564) This passage is obscure, and probably corrupt. I\nhave followed the commentator as much as possible. He says: 'If the Hot _ri_\npriest proceeds with reciting the _s_ astra, looking to the Anush _t_ ubh,\nwhich is speech, and not to the thousand of B _ri_ hatis which are breath,\nthen, neglecting the B _ri_ hati (breath), and driven by his mind to the Anush\n_t_ ubh (speech), he does not by his speech obtain that _s_ astra. For in\nspeech without breath the Hot _ri_ cannot, through the mere wish of the mind,\nsay the _s_ astra, the activity of all the senses being dependent on breath.'\nThe commentator therefore takes vagabhi for va _k_ am abhi, or for some old\nlocative case formed by abhi. He also would seem to have read pra _n_ e na.\nOne might attempt another construction, though it is very doubtful. One might\ntranslate, 'For that self, which is speech, is incomplete, because he\nunderstands if driven to the mind by breath, not (if driven) by speech.'\n\n[228:2](sbe01218.htm#fr_565) Either in the _s_ astra, or in the list of\nmetres, there being some that have more, others that have less syllables.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 6](sbe01219.htm)\n\n"
