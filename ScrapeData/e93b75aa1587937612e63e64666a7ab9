say,  \nThus glorious in thy bright array.'  \nHe ceased: the king of birds replied,  \nWhile flashed his eye with joy and pride:  \n'In me, O Raghu's son, behold  \nOne who has loved thee from of old:  \nGarud, the lord of all that fly,  \nThy guardian and thy friend am I.  \nNot all the Gods in heaven could loose  \nThese numbing bonds, this serpent noose,  \nWherewith fierce Ravan's son, renowned  \nFor magic arts, your limbs had bound.  \nThose arrows fixed in every limb  \nWere mighty snakes, transformed by him.  \nBlood thirsty race, they live beneath  \nThe earth, and slay with venomed teeth.  \nOn, smite the lord of Lanka's isle,  \nBut guard you from the giants' guile  \nWho each dishonest art employ  \nAnd by deceit brave foes destroy.  \nSo shall the tyrant Ravan bleed,  \nAnd Sita from his power be freed.'  \nThus Garud spake: then, swift as thought,  \nThe region of the sky he sought,  \nWhere in the distance like a blaze  \nOf fire he vanished from the gaze.  \n   Then the glad Vanars joy rang out  \nIn many a wild tumultuous shout,  \nAnd the loud roar of drum and shell  \nStartled each distant sentinel.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[464:1](ry449.htm#fr_969) The preceptor of the Gods.\n\n[465:1](ry449.htm#fr_970) Rama's grandfather.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LI.: Dhumraksha's Sally.](ry450.htm)\n\n"
