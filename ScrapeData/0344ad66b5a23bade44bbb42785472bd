S\xc2\x92ri Naraya _n_ a said :-- The Brahma _n_ as that will perform duly the\nS\xc2\x92irovrata, to be described in the following, are the only ones who will\nattain very easily the highest knowledge, destroying all Avidya or Ignorance.\nSo much so that the rules of right living and right conduct as ordained in the\nS\xc2\x92rutis and Smritis are not necessary to be observed by those who duly and\ndevotedly perform the S\xc2\x92irovrata (i.e., vow of the head; i.e., vow to apply\nashes on the forehead). O Learned One! It is through this S\xc2\x92irovrata that\nBrahma and the other Devas have been able to get their Brahmahood and the\nDevahood. The ancient sages glorified highly this S\xc2\x92irovrata. Brahma, Vi _sn_\nu, Rudra and the other Devas all performed this S\xc2\x92irovrata. O Wise One! Those\nthat performed\n\n\n\np. 1077\n\n\n\nduly this S\xc2\x92irovrata, all became sinless though they were sinful in every way.\nIts name is S\xc2\x92irovrata, inasmuch as it is mentioned in the first part of the\nAtharva Veda. Only this vrata (vow) is called S'irovrata; no other thing is\ndenominated by this name. By no other merit can this be acquired. O Muni!\nDifferent names are assigned to this vrata in different S\xc2\x92akhas; in fact, they\nare all one and the same.\n\n\n\nN. B. -- Pasupata vrata, S'ivavrata, etc., are the different names assigned to\nit. In all the S\xc2\x92akhas, the One Substance, Intelligence solidified named S'iva\nand the knowledge thereof is mentioned. This is \xc2\x93S\xc2\x92irovrata.\xc2\x94 He who does not\nperform this S\xc2\x92irovrata, is irreligious and he is banished from all religious\nacts, though he is well-qualified in all branches of learning. There is no\nmanner of doubt in this. This S\xc2\x92irovrata is like the blazing fire in\ndestroying wholly the forest of sins. All knowledge fleshes before him who\nperforms this S\xc2\x92irovrata. The Atharva S\xc2\x92ruti expounds the subtle and\nparticularly incomprehensible things; this S\xc2\x92ruti declares the above\nS\xc2\x92irovrata as daily to be done; so it is one of the daily observances. \xc2\x93Fire\nis ashes,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93water is ashes,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93earth is ashes,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93air is ashes,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93ether or\n\xc3\x82kas'a is ashes,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93all this manifest Universe is ashes.\xc2\x94 These six mantras\nstated in the Atharva Veda are to be recited; after this, ashes are to be\nbesmeared all over the body. This is named the S\xc2\x92irovrata. The devotee is to\nput on these ashes named S\xc2\x92irovrata during his Sandhyopasana (practising\nSandhya thrice a day); so long as the Brahma Vidya (the knowledge of Brahma)\ndoes not arise in him. One is to make a Sankalpa (resolve) of twelve years\nbefore one starts with this Vrata. In cases of incapability, a period of one\nyear or six months, or three months or at least twelve days are to be adopted.\nThat Guru is considered very cruel and his knowledge will come to an end who\nhesitates and does not impart the knowledge of the Vedas and other things to\nhim who is purified by observing this S\xc2\x92irovrata. Know him certainly as a very\nmerciful Guru who illumines the heart by Brahma Vidya just as God is very\nmerciful and compassionate to all the living beings. One who performs one's\nown Dharmas for many births, acquires particular faith in this S\xc2\x92irovrata;\nothers can have no faith in this. Rather he gets animosity for this vrata,\nbecause of the abundance of ignorance in him. So one ought never to advise on\nspiritual knowledge to an enemy who has no faith, rather who has hatred for\nany such thing. Those only that are purified by the observance of S\xc2\x92irovrata\nare entitled to Brahma Vidya; and none others. So the Vedas command :-- Those\nare to be advised on Brahma Vidya who have performed S\xc2\x92irovrata. Even the\nanimal becomes freed of his animalism, as a result of this vrata; no sin\noccurs in killing that animal; this is\n\n\n\np. 1078\n\n** **\n\nthe decision of the Vedanta. It has been repeatedly uttered by Javala Ri _s_ i\nthat the Dharma of the Brahma _n_ as is to put on the Tripu _nd_ ra (three\ncurved lines of ashes on the forehead). The householders are instructed to put\non this Tripu _nd_ ra by repeating the mantra \xc2\x93triyamvaka\xc2\x94' with Om prefixed.\nThose that are in the stage of the Bhik _s_ us (Sannyasis, etc.,) are to put\non this Tripu _nd_ ra uttering thrice the mantra \xc2\x93Om Hasa _h._ \xc2\x94 Such is\nregularly stated in Javala S\xc2\x92ruti. The house holders and the Vanaprasthis\n(foresters) are to put on this Tripu _nd_ ra, uttering Triyamvaka mantra\npurified with \xc2\x93Haum\xc2\x94 the pra _n_ ava of S\xc2\x92iva prefixed.\n\n\n\nThose that are the Brahmacharis are to use daily this Tripu _nd_ ra uttering\nthe mantra \xc2\x93Medhavi,\xc2\x94 etc. The Brahma _n_ as are to apply the ashes in three\ncurved lines on the forehead. The God S\xc2\x92iva is always hidden under the cover\nof ashes; so the S\xc2\x92aivas, the devotees of S\xc2\x92iva are to use the Tripu _nd_ ra.\nThe Brahma _n_ as are to use daily this Tripu _nd_ ra. Brahma is the Prime\nBrahmi _n_. When He used Tripu _nd_ ra on His forehead, what need to tell,\nthen, that every Brahma _n_ ought always to use it! Never fail, out of error,\nto besmear your body with the ashes as prescribed in the Vedas and worship the\nS\xc2\x92iva Lingam. The Sannyasins are to apply Tripu _nd_ ra on their forehead,\narms, chest, uttering the Triyamvaka mantra with Om prefixed and also the five\nlettered mantra of S'iva \xc2\x93Om Nama _h_ S\xc2\x92ivaya.\xc2\x94 The Brahmacharis should use\nTripu _nd_ ra of ashes, obtained from their own fire, uttering the mantra\n\xc2\x93Triyayu _s_ am Jamadagneh,\xc2\x94 etc., or the mantra \xc2\x93Medhavi\xc2\x94, etc. The S\xc2\x92udras\nin the service of the Brahmi _n_ s are to use the ashes with devotion, with\nthe mantra \xc2\x93Nama _h_ S\xc2\x92ivaya.\xc2\x94 The other ordinary persons can use the Tripu\n_nd_ ra without any mantra. To besmear the body all over with ashes and to put\non the Tripu _nd_ ra is the essence of all Dharma; therefore this should be\nused always. The ashes from the Agnihotra Sacrifice or from Virajagni (Viraja\nfire) are to be carefully placed on a clean and pure basin. Cleansing hands\nand feet, one is to sip (perform \xc3\x82chamana) twice, and then, taking the ashes\nin the hand, utter the five Brahma mantras \xc2\x93Sadyoyatam prapadyami,\xc2\x94 etc., and\nperform short Pra _n_ ayama thrice; he is, then, to utter the seven mantras\n\xc2\x93Fire is ashes,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93water is ashes,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93earth is ashes\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93Teja is ashes,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93wind is\nashes,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93ether is ashes,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93All this whatsoever is ashes\xc2\x94 and purify and\nimpregnate the ashes with the mantra by blowing out air through the mouth.\nThen one is to think of Maha Deva, repeating the mantra \xc2\x93Om Apojyoti,\xc2\x94 etc.,\nand apply dry ashes of white colour all over the body and become sinless.\nAfter this he is to meditate on the Maha Vi _sn_ u, the Lord of the universe\nand on the Lord of the waters and repeat again the mantras \xc2\x93Fire is ashes\xc2\x94 and\nmix water with the ashes. He is, then, to think of S\xc2\x92iva and apply ashes on\nhis forehead. He is to think of the ashes as S\xc2\x92iva Himself and\n\n\n\np. 1079\n\n\n\nthen, with mantras appropriate to his own \xc3\x82s'rama (stages of life) use the\nTripu _nd_ ra on his forehead, chest and shoulders.\n\n\n\nBy the middle finger and ringfinger he is to draw the two lines of the ashes\nfrom the left to the right and by his thumb draw a third line of ashes from\nthe right to the left. These Tripu _nd_ ras are to be used in the morning,\nmidday and in the evening.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Ninth chapter of the Eleventh Book on the rules of S'irovrata in\nthe Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i\nVeda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 10](bk11ch10.htm)\n\n"
