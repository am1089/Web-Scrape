The\nsupreme Purusha called Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u, who is the great yogin, the great being and the\ngreat \xe1\xb9\xadapasvin, is seen as a lamp in the path of the truth. The Grandfather\n(Brahm\xc4\x81) having saluted the Lord of the universe (Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u) and having paid Him\ndue respects, asked Him (thus): "Pray, explain to us the truth of yoga which\nincludes in it the eight subservients." To which H\xe1\xb9\x9bsh\xc4\xabke\xc5\x9ba (the Lord of the\nsenses or Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u) replied thus: "Listen. I shall explain its truth. All souls\nare immersed in happiness and sorrow through the snare of m\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81. Kaivalya, the\nsupreme seat, is the path which gives them emancipation, which rends asunder\nthe snare of m\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81, which is the destroyer of birth, old age and disease and\nwhich enables one to overcome death. There are no other paths to salvation.\nThose who go round the net of \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81s\xe1\xb9\xadras are deluded by that knowledge. It is\nimpossible even for the \xe1\xb8\x8cevas to describe that indescribable state. How can\nthat which is self-shining be illuminated by the \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81s\xe1\xb9\xadras? That only which is\nwithout parts and stains and which is quiescent beyond all and free from decay\nbecomes the j\xc4\xabva (self) on account of the results of past virtues and sins.\nHow did that which is the seat of Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, is eternal, and above the state\nof all existing things and is of the form of wisdom and without stains attain\nthe state of j\xc4\xabva? A bubble arose in it as in water and in this (bubble) arose\n\np. 193\n\naha\xe1\xb9\x85k\xc4\x81ra. To it arose a ball (of body) made of the five (elements) and bound\nby \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadus. Know that to be j\xc4\xabva which is associated with happiness and misery\nand hence is the term j\xc4\xabva applied to Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 which is pure. That j\xc4\xabva is\nconsidered to be the kevala (alone) which is freed from the stains of passion,\nanger, fear, delusion, greed, pride, lust, birth, death, miserliness, swoon,\ngiddiness, hunger, thirst, ambition, shame, fright, heart-burning, grief and\ngladness.\n\n"So I shall tell you the means of destroying (these) sins. How could j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na\ncapable of giving moksha arise certainly without yoga? And even yoga becomes\npowerless in (securing) moksha when it is devoid of j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na. So the aspirant\nafter emancipation should practise (firmly) both yoga and j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na. The cycle of\nbirths and deaths comes only through aj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na and perishes only through j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na.\nJ\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na alone was originally. It should be known as the only means (of\nsalvation). That is j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na through which one cognises (in himself) the real\nnature of kaivalya as the supreme seat, the stainless, the partless, and of\nthe nature of Sachchi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81nan\xe1\xb8\x8da without birth, existence and death and without\nmotion and j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na.\n\n"Now I shall proceed to describe yoga to you. Yoga is divided into many kinds\non account of its actions: ( _viz_.,) Man\xe1\xb9\xadrayoga, Layayoga, Hathayoga, and\nR\xc4\x81jayoga. There are four states common to all these: ( _viz_.,) \xc4\x80rambha,\nGhata, Parichaya, and Nishpa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadi. O Brahm\xc4\x81, I shall describe these to you.\nListen attentively. One should practise the Man\xe1\xb9\xadra along with its m\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadrik\xc4\x81s\n(proper intonations of the sounds) and others for a period of twelve years;\nthen he gradually obtains wisdom along with the si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhis, (such as) a\xe1\xb9\x87im\xc4\x81, etc.\nPersons of weak intellect who are the least qualified for yoga practise this.\nThe (second) Laya-yoga tends towards the absorption of the chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada and is\ndescribed in myriads of ways; (one of which is)--one should contemplate upon\nthe Lord who is without parts (even) while walking, sitting, sleeping, or\neating. This is called Laya-yoga. Now hear (the description of) Hatha-yoga.\nThis yoga is said to possess (the following) eight subservients, yama\n(forbearance), niyama (religious observance), \xc4\x81sana\n\np. 194\n\n[paragraph continues] (posture), pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81ma (suppression of breath), pra\xe1\xb9\xady\xc4\x81h\xc4\x81ra\n(subjugation of the senses), \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81 (concentration), \xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81na, the\ncontemplation on Hari in the middle of the eyebrows and sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi that is the\nstate of equality. Mah\xc4\x81mu\xe1\xb8\x8dr\xc4\x81, Mah\xc4\x81ban\xe1\xb8\x8dha and Khechar\xc4\xab, J\xc4\x81lan\xe1\xb8\x8dhara, Uddiy\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a,\nand M\xc5\xablaban\xe1\xb8\x8dha, uttering without intermission Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava (Om) for a long time,\nand hearing the exposition of the supreme truths, Vajrol\xc4\xab, Amarol\xc4\xab and\nSahajol\xc4\xab, which form a triad--all these separately I shall give a true\ndescription of. O four-faced one (Brahma), among (the duties of) yama moderate\neating--and not others--forms the principal factor; and non-injury is most\nimportant in niyama. (The chief postures are) four ( _viz_.,) Si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dha, Pa\xe1\xb8\x8dma,\nSimha and Bha\xe1\xb8\x8dra. During the early stages of practice, the following obstacles\ntake place, O four-faced one, ( _viz_.,) laziness, idle talk, association with\nbad characters, acquisition of man\xe1\xb9\xadras, etc., playing with metals (alchemy)\nand woman, etc., and mirage. A wise man having found out these should abandon\nthem by the force of his virtues. Then assuming Pa\xe1\xb8\x8dma posture, he should\npractise pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81ma. He should erect a beautiful monastery with a very small\nopening and with no crevices. It should be well pasted with cow-dung or with\nwhite cement. It should be carefully freed from bugs, mosquitoes and lice. It\nshould be swept well every day with a broom. It should be perfumed with good\nodours; and fragrant resins should burn in it. Having taken his seat neither\ntoo high nor too low on a cloth, deerskin and ku\xc5\x9ba grass spread, one over the\nother, the wise man should assume the Pa\xe1\xb8\x8dma posture and keeping his body erect\nand his hands folded in respect, should salute his tutelary deity. Then\nclosing the right nostril with his right thumb, he should gradually draw in\nthe air through the left nostril. Having restrained it as long as possible, be\nshould again expel it through the right nostril slowly and not very fast. Thon\nfilling the stomach through the right nostril, he should retain it as long as\nhe can and then expel it through the left nostril. Drawing the air through\nthat nostril by which he expels, he should continue this in uninterrupted\nsuccession. The time taken in making a round of the knee with the palm of the\n\np. 195\n\nhand, neither very slowly nor very rapidly, and snapping the fingers once is\ncalled a m\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81. Drawing the air through the left nostril for about sixteen\nm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81s and having retained it (within) for about sixty-four m\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81s, one should\nexpel it again through the right nostril for about thirty-two m\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81s. Again\nfill the right nostril as before (and continue the rest). Practise cessation\nof breath four times daily ( _viz_.,) at sunrise, noon, sunset and midnight,\ntill eighty (times are reached). By a continual practice for about three\nmonths, the purification of the n\xc4\x81dis takes place. When the Midis have become\npurified, certain external signs appear on the body of the yogin. I shall\nproceed to describe them. (They are) lightness of the body, brilliancy of\ncomplexion, increase of the gastric fire, leanness of the body, and along with\nthese, absence of restlessness in the body. The proficient in yoga should\nabandon the food detrimental to the practice of yoga. He should give up salt,\nmustard, things sour, hot, pungent, or bitter, vegetables, asafoetida, etc.,\nworship of fire, women, walking, bathing at sunrise, emaciation of the body by\nfasts, etc. During the early stages of practice, food of milk and ghee is\nordained; also food consisting of wheat, green pulse and red rice are said to\nfavour the progress. Then he will be able to retain his breath as long as he\nlikes. By thus retaining the breath as long as he likes, kevala kumbhaka\n(cessation of breath without inspiration and expiration) is attained. When\nkevala kumbhaka is attained by one, and thus expiration and inspiration are\ndispensed with, there is nothing unattainable in the three worlds to him. In\nthe commencement (of his practice), sweat is given out; he should wipe it off.\nEven after that, owing to the retaining of the breath, the person practising\nit gets phlegm. Then by an increased practice of \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81, sweat arises. As a\nfrog moves by leaps, so the yogin sitting in the Pa\xe1\xb8\x8dma posture moves on the\nearth. With a (further) increased practice, he is able to rise from the\nground. He, while seated in Pa\xe1\xb8\x8dma posture, levitates. There arises to him the\npower to perform extraordinary feats. He does (or should) not disclose to\nothers his feats of great powers (in the path). Any pain small or\n\np. 196\n\ngreat, does not affect the yogin. Then excretions and sleep are diminished;\ntears, rheum in the eye, salivary flow, sweat and bad smell in the mouth do\nnot arise in him. With a still further practice, he acquires great strength by\nwhich he attains Bh\xc5\xabchara si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi, which enables him to bring under his control\nall the creatures that tread this earth; tigers, \xc5\x9barabhas, 1 elephants, wild\nbulls or lions die on being struck by the palm of the yogin. He becomes as\nbeautiful as the god of love himself. All females being taken up with the\nbeauty of his person will desire to have intercourse with him. If he so keeps\nconnection, his virility will be lost; so abandoning all copulation with\nwomen, he should continue his practice with great assiduity. By the\npreservation of the semen, a good odour pervades the body of the yogin. Then\nsitting in a secluded place, he should repeat Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava (Om) with three plu\xe1\xb9\xada-\nm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81s (or prolonged intonation) for the destruction of his former sins. The\nman\xe1\xb9\xadra, Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava (Om) destroys all obstacles and all sins. By practising thus\nhe attains the \xc4\x81rambha (beginning or first) state.\n\n"Then follows the ghata (second state)--one which is acquired by constantly\npractising suppression of breath. When a perfect union takes place between\npr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a and ap\xc4\x81na, manas and bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi, or j\xc4\xabv\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 and Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 without\nopposition, it is called the ghata state. I shall describe its signs. He may\nnow practise only for about one-fourth of the period prescribed for practice\nbefore. By day and evening, let him practise only for a y\xc4\x81ma (3 hours). Let\nhim practise kevala kumbhaka once a day. Drawing away completely the organs\nfrom the objects of sense during cessation of breath is called pra\xe1\xb9\xady\xc4\x81h\xc4\x81ra.\nWhatever he sees with his eyes, let him consider as \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. Whatever he hears\nwith his ears let him consider as \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. Whatever [he](errata.htm#13) smells\nwith his nose let him consider as \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. Whatever he tastes with his tongue let\nhim consider as \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. Whatever the yogin touches with his skin let him\nconsider as \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. The yogin should thus unwearied gratify his organs of sense\nfor a period of one y\xc4\x81ma every day with great effort. Then various wonderful\npowers are attained by the yogin, such as clairvoyance,\n\np. 197\n\nclairaudience, ability to transport himself to great distances within a\nmoment, great power of speech, ability to take any form, ability to become\ninvisible, and the transmutation of iron into gold when the former is smeared\nover with his excretion.\n\n"That yogin who is constantly practising yoga attains the power to levitate.\nThen should the wise yogin think that these powers are great obstacles to the\nattainment of yoga, and so he should never take delight in them. The king of\nyogins should not exercise his powers before any person whatsoever. He should\nlive in the world as a fool, an idiot, or a deaf man, in order to keep his\npowers concealed. His disciples would, without doubt, request him to show his\npowers for the gratification of their own desires. One who is actively engaged\nin one\'s duties forgets to practise (yoga); so he should practise day and\nnight yoga without forgetting the words of the guru. Thus passes the ghata\nstate to one who is constantly engaged in yoga practice. To one nothing is\ngained by useless company, since thereby he does not practise yoga. So one\nshould with great effort practise yoga. Then by this constant practice is\ngained the parichaya state (the third state). V\xc4\x81yu (or breath) through arduous\npractice pierces along with agni the Ku\xe1\xb9\x87dalin\xc4\xab through thought and enters the\nSushumn\xc4\x81 uninterrupted. When one\'s chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada enters Sushumn\xc4\x81 along with pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a, it\nreaches the high seat (of the head probably) along with pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a.\n\n"There are the five elements ( _viz_.,) p\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadhiv\xc4\xab, \xc4\x81pas, agni, v\xc4\x81yu and \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b. To\nthe body of the five elements, there is the fivefold \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81. From the feet to\nthe knees is said to be the region of p\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadhiv\xc4\xab, is four-sided in shape, is\nyellow in colour and has the var\xe1\xb9\x87a (or letter) _La_. Carrying the breath with\nthe letter _La_ along the region of earth ( _viz_., from the foot to the\nknees) and contemplating upon Brahma with four faces and four mouths and of a\ngolden colour, one should perform \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81 there for a period of two hours. He\nthen attains mastery over the earth. Death does not trouble him, since he has\nobtained mastery over the earth element. The region of \xc4\x81pas is said to\n\np. 198\n\nextend from the knees to the anus. \xc4\x80pas is semi-lunar in shape and white in\ncolour and has _Va_ for its b\xc4\xabja (seed) letter. Carrying up the breath with\nthe letter _Va_ along the region of \xc4\x81pas, he should contemplate on the God\nN\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a having four arms and a crowned head, as being of the colour of pure\ncrystal, as dressed in orange clothes and as decayless; and practising \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81\nthere for a period of two hours, he is freed from all sins. Then there is no\nfear for him from water, and he does not meet his death in water. From the\nanus to the heart is said to be the region of agni. Agni is triangular in\nshape, of red colour, and has the letter _Ra_ for its (b\xc4\xabja) seed. Raising the\nbreath made resplendent through the letter _Ra_ along the region of fire, he\nshould contemplate on Ru\xe1\xb8\x8dra, who has three eyes, who grants all wishes, who is\nof the colour of the midday sun, who is daubed all over with holy ashes and\nwho is of a pleased countenance. Practising \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81 there for a period of two\nhours, he is not burnt by fire even though his body enters the fire-pit. From\nthe heart to the middle of the eyebrows is said to be the region of v\xc4\x81yu. V\xc4\x81yu\nis hexangular in shape, black in colour and shines with the letter _Ya_.\nCarrying the breath along the region of v\xc4\x81yu, he should contemplate on \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara,\nthe Omniscient, as possessing faces on all sides; and practising \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81 there\nfor two hours, he enters v\xc4\x81yu and then \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b. The yogin does not meet his death\nthrough the fear of v\xc4\x81yu. From the centre of the eyebrows to the top of the\nhead is said to be the region of \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, is circular in shape, smoky in colour\nand shining with the letter _Ha_. Raising the breath along the region of \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b,\nhe should contemplate on Sa\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81\xc5\x9biva in the following manner, as producing\nhappiness, as of the shape of bin\xe1\xb8\x8du, as the great \xe1\xb8\x8deva, as having the shape of\n\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, as shining like pure crystal, as wearing the rising crescent of moon on\nhis head, as having five faces, ten heads and three eyes, as being of a\npleased countenance, as armed with all weapons, as adorned with all ornaments,\nas having Um\xc4\x81 (the goddess) in one-half of his body, as ready to grant\nfavours, and as the cause of all the causes. By practising \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81 in the\nregion of \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, he obtains\n\np. 199\n\ncertainly the power of levitating in the \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b (ether). Wherever he stays, he\nenjoys supreme bliss. The proficient in yoga should practise these five\n\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81s. Then his body becomes strong and he does not know death. That great-\nminded man does not die even during the deluge of Brahma.\n\n"Then he should practise \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81 for a period of six ghatik\xc4\x81s (2 hours, 24\nminutes). Restraining the breath in (the region of) \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b and contemplating on\nthe deity who grants his wishes--this is said to be sagu\xe1\xb9\x87a 1 \xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81na capable of\ngiving (the si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhis) a\xe1\xb9\x87im\xc4\x81, etc. One who is engaged in nirgu\xe1\xb9\x87a 1 \xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81na\nattains the stage of sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi. Within twelve days at least, he attains the\nstage of sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi. Restraining his breath, the wise one becomes an emancipated\nperson. Sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi is that state in which the j\xc4\xabv\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 (lower self) and the\nParam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 (higher self) are differenceless (or of equal state). If he desires\nto lay aside his body, he can do so. He will become absorbed in Parabrahman\nand does not require u\xe1\xb9\xadkr\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xadi (going out or up). But if he does not so desire,\nand if his body is dear to him, he lives in all the worlds possessing the\nsi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhis of a\xe1\xb9\x87im\xc4\x81, etc. Sometimes he becomes a \xe1\xb8\x8deva and lives honoured in\nsvarga; or he becomes a man or an yaksha through his will. He can also take\nthe form of a lion, tiger, elephant, or horse through his own will. The yogin\nbecoming the great Lord can live as long as he likes. There is difference only\nin the modes of procedure but the result is the same.\n\n"Place the left heel pressed on the anus, stretch the right leg and hold it\nfirmly with both hands. Place the head on the breast and inhale the air\nslowly. Restrain the breath as long as you can and then slowly breathe out.\nAfter practising it with the left foot, practise it with the right. Place the\nfoot that was stretched before on the thigh. This is mah\xc4\x81ban\xe1\xb8\x8dha and should be\npractised on both sides. The yogin sitting in mah\xc4\x81ban\xe1\xb8\x8dha and having inhaled\nthe air with intent mind, should stop the course of v\xc4\x81yu (inside) by means of\nthe throat-mu\xe1\xb8\x8dr\xc4\x81, and occupying the two sides (of the throat) with speed. This\nis called mah\xc4\x81ve\xe1\xb8\x8dha and is frequently practised by the si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhas. With the\ntongue thrust\n\np. 200\n\ninto the interior cavity of the head (or throat) and with the eyes intent on\nthe spot between the eyebrows, this is called khechar\xc4\xabmu\xe1\xb8\x8dr\xc4\x81. Contracting the\nmuscles of the neck and placing the head with a firm will on the breast, this\nis called the j\xc4\x81lan\xe1\xb8\x8dhara (ban\xe1\xb8\x8dha) and is a lion to the elephant of death. That\nban\xe1\xb8\x8dha by which pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a flies through Sushumn\xc4\x81 is called uddiy\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87aba\xe1\xb9\x87dha by the\nyogins. Pressing the heel firmly against the anus, contracting the anus and\ndrawing up the ap\xc4\x81na, this is said to be yoniban\xe1\xb8\x8dha. Through m\xc5\xablaban\xe1\xb8\x8dha, pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a\nand ap\xc4\x81na as well as n\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da and bin\xe1\xb8\x8du are united and gives success in yoga:\nthere is no doubt about this. To one practising in a reversed manner (or on\nboth sides) which destroys all diseases, the gastric fire is increased.\nTherefore a practitioner should collect a large quantity of provisions, (for)\nif he takes a small quantity of food, the fire (within) will consume his body\nin a moment.\n\n"On the first day, he should stand on his head with the feet raised up for a\nmoment. He should increase this period gradually every day. Wrinkles and\ngreyness of hair will disappear within three months. He who practises only for\na period of a y\xc4\x81ma (twenty-four minutes) every day conquers time. He who\npractises vajrol\xc4\xab becomes a yogin and the repository of all si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhis. If the\nyoga si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhis are ever to be attained, he only has them within his reach. He\nknows the past and the future and certainly moves in the air. He who drinks of\nthe nectar thus is rendered immortal day by day. He should daily practise\nvajrol\xc4\xab. Then it is called amarol\xc4\xab. Then he obtains the r\xc4\x81jayoga and certainly\nhe does not meet with obstacles. When a yogin fulfils his action by r\xc4\x81jayoga,\nthen he certainly obtains discrimination and indifference to objects. Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u,\nthe great yogin, the grand one of great austerities and the most excellent\nPurusha is seen as a lamp in the path of truth.\n\n"That breast from which one suckled before (in his previous birth) he now\npresses (in love) and obtains pleasure. He enjoys the same genital organ from\nwhich he was born before. She who was once his mother will now be wife and she\nwho is now wife is (or will be) verily mother. He who is now father will be\n\np. 201\n\nagain son, and he who is now son will be again father. Thus are the egos of\nthis world wandering in the womb of birth and death like a bucket in the wheel\nof a well and enjoying the worlds. There are the three worlds, three ve\xe1\xb8\x8das,\nthree san\xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81s, (morning, noon and evening), three svaras (sounds), three\nagnis, and gu\xe1\xb9\x87as, and all these are placed in the three letters (Om). He who\nunderstands that which is indestructible and is the meaning of the three\n(Om)--by him are all these worlds strung. This is the Truth, the supreme seat.\nAs the smell in the flower, as the ghee in the milk, as the oil in the\ngingelly seed and as the gold in the quartz, so is the lotus situated in the\nheart. Its face is downwards and its stem upwards. Its bin\xe1\xb8\x8du is downwards and\nin its centre is situated manas. By the letter A, the lotus becomes expanded;\nby the letter U, it becomes split (or opened), by the letter M, it obtains\nn\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da; and the ar\xe1\xb8\x8dham\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81 (half-metre) is silence. The person engaged in yoga\nobtains [the](errata.htm#14) supreme seat, which is like a pure crystal, which\nis without parts and which destroys all sins. As a tortoise draws its hands\nand head within itself, so drawing in air thus and expelling it through the\nnine holes of the body, he breathes upwards and forwards. Like a lamp in an\nair-tight jar which is motionless, so that which is seen motionless through\nthe process of yoga in the heart and which is free from turmoil, after having\nbeen drawn from the nine holes, is said to be \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 alone."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[196:1](tmu25.htm#fr_159) An animal said to have eight legs and to be stronger\nthan lion.\n\n[199:1](tmu25.htm#fr_161) .Lit., "with gu\xe1\xb9\x87as" and "without gu\xe1\xb9\x87as".\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 24. \xe1\xb8\x8chy\xc4\x81nabin\xe1\xb8\x8du-Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d of S\xc4\x81mave\xe1\xb8\x8da](tmu26.htm)\n\n'
