Brahman, whose nature is\nintelligence, and that there exists no scriptural passage which can be used to\nestablish systems opposed to the Vedanta, more especially the Sa _n_ khya\nsystem. The task of the two first padas of the second adhyaya is to rebut any\nobjections which may be raised against the Vedanta doctrine on purely\nspeculative grounds, apart from scriptural authority, and to show, again on\npurely speculative grounds, that none of the systems irreconcilable with the\nVedanta can be satisfactorily established.\n\n### P\xc3\x82DA I.\n\nAdhikara _n_ a I refutes the Sa _n_ khya objection that the acceptation of the\nVedanta system involves the rejection of the Sa _n_ khya doctrine which after\nall constitutes a part of Sm _ri_ ti, and as such has claims on consideration.\n--To accept the Sa _n_ khya-sm _ri_ ti, the Vedantin replies, would compel us\nto reject other Sm _ri_ tis, such as the Manu-sm _ri_ ti, which are opposed to\nthe Sa _n_ khya doctrine. The conflicting claims of Sm _ri_ tis can be settled\nonly on the ground of the Veda, and there can be no doubt that the Veda does\nnot confirm the Sa _n_ khya-sm _ri_ ti, but rather those Sm _ri_ tis which\nteach the origination of the world from an intelligent primary cause.\n\nAdhik. II (3) extends the same line of argumentation to the Yoga-sm _ri_ ti.\n\nAdhik. III (4-11) shows that Brahman, although of the nature of intelligence,\nyet may be the cause of the non-intelligent material world, and that it is not\ncontaminated by the qualities of the world when the latter is refunded into\nBrahman. For ordinary experience teaches us that like does not always spring\nfrom like, and that the qualities of effected things when the latter are\nrefunded into their causes--as when golden ornaments, for instance, are melted\n\np. xlviii\n\nand thereby become simple gold again--do not continue to exist in those\ncauses.--Here also the argumentation is specially directed against the Sa _n_\nkhyas, who, in order to account for the materiality and the various\nimperfections of the world, think it necessary to assume a causal substance\nparticipating in the same characteristics.\n\nAdhik. IV (12) points out that the line of reasoning followed in the preceding\nadhikara _n_ a is valid also against other theories, such as the atomistic\ndoctrine.\n\nThe one Sutra (13) constituting Adhik. V teaches, according to _S_ a _n_ kara,\nthat although the enjoying souls as well as the objects of fruition are in\nreality nothing but Brahman, and on that account identical, yet the two sets\nmay practically be held apart, just as in ordinary life we hold apart, and\ndistinguish as separate individual things, the waves, ripples, and foam of the\nsea, although at the bottom waves, ripples, and foam are all of them identical\nas being neither more nor less than sea-water.--The _S_ ri-bhashya gives a\ntotally different interpretation of the Sutra, according to which the latter\nhas nothing whatever to do with the eventual non-distinction of enjoying souls\nand objects to be enjoyed. Translated according to Ramanu _g_ a\'s view, the\nSutra runs as follows: \'If non-distinction (of the Lord and the individual\nsouls) is said to result from the circumstance of (the Lord himself) becoming\nan enjoyer (a soul), we refute this objection by instances from every-day\nexperience.\' That is to say: If it be maintained that from our doctrine\npreviously expounded, according to which this world springs from the Lord and\nconstitutes his body, it follows that the Lord, as an embodied being, is not\nessentially different from other souls, and subject to fruition as they are;\nwe reply that the Lord\'s having a body does not involve his being subject to\nfruition, not any more than in ordinary life a king, although himself an\nembodied being, is affected by the experiences of pleasure and pain which his\nservants have to undergo.--The construction which Ramanu _g_ a puts on the\nSutra is not repugnant either to the words of the Sutra or to the context in\nwhich the latter stands, and that it rests on earlier authority appears\n\np. xlix\n\nfrom a quotation made by Ramanu _g_ a from the Drami _d_ abhashyakara 1.\n\nAdhik. VI (14-20) treats of the non-difference of the effect from the cause; a\nVedanta doctrine which is defended by its adherents against the Vai _s_\neshikas according to whom the effect is something different from the cause.--\nThe divergent views of _S_ a _n_ kara and Ramanu _g_ a on this important point\nhave been sufficiently illustrated in the general sketch of the two systems.\n\nAdhik. VII (21-23) refutes the objection that, from the Vedic passages\ninsisting on the identity of the Lord and the individual soul, it follows that\nthe Lord must be like the individual soul the cause of evil, and that hence\nthe entire doctrine of an all-powerful and all-wise Lord being the cause of\nthe world has to be rejected. For, the Sutra-kara remarks, the creative\nprinciple of the world is additional to, i.e. other than, the individual soul,\nthe difference of the two being distinctly declared by Scripture.--The way in\nwhich the three Sutras constituting this adhikara _n_ a are treated by _S_ a\n_n_ kara on the one hand and Ramanu _g_ a on the other is characteristic.\nRamanu _g_ a throughout simply follows the words of the Sutras, of which Sutra\n21 formulates the objection based on such texts as \'Thou art that,\' while\nSutra 22 replies that Brahman is different from the soul, since that is\nexpressly declared by Scripture. _S_ a _n_ kara, on the other hand, sees\nhimself obliged to add that the difference of the two, plainly maintained in\nSutra 22, is not real, but due to the soul\'s fictitious limiting adjuncts.\n\nAdhik. VIII (24, 25) shows that Brahman, although destitute of material and\ninstruments of action, may yet produce the world, just as gods by their mere\npower create\n\np. l\n\npalaces, animals, and the like, and as milk by itself turns into curds.\n\nAdhik. IX (26-29) explains that, according to the express doctrine of\nScripture, Brahman does not in its entirety pass over into the world, and,\nalthough emitting the world from itself, yet remains one and undivided. This\nis possible, according to _S_ a _n_ kara, because the world is unreal;\naccording to Ramanu _g_ a, because the creation is merely the visible and\ntangible manifestation of what previously existed in Brahman in a subtle\nimperceptible condition.\n\nAdhik. X (30, 31) teaches that Brahman, although destitute of instruments of\naction, is enabled to create the world by means of the manifold powers which\nit possesses.\n\nAdhik. XI (32, 33) assigns the motive of the creation, or, more properly\nexpressed, teaches that Brahman, in creating the world, has no motive in the\nstrict sense of the word, but follows a mere sportive impulse.\n\nAdhik. XII (34-36) justifies Brahman from the charges of partiality and\ncruelty which might be brought against it owing to the inequality of position\nand fate of the various animate beings, and the universal suffering of the\nworld. Brahman, as a creator and dispenser, acts with a view to the merit and\ndemerit of the individual souls, and has so acted from all eternity.\n\nAdhik. XIII (37) sums up the preceding argumentation by declaring that all the\nqualities of Brahman--omniscience and so on--are such as to capacitate it for\nthe creation of the world.\n\n### P\xc3\x82DA II.\n\nThe task of the second pada is to refute, by arguments independent of Vedic\npassages, the more important philosophical theories concerning the origin of\nthe world which are opposed to the Vedanta view.--The first adhikara _n_ a\n(1-10) is directed against the Sa _n_ khyas, whose doctrine had already been\ntouched upon incidentally in several previous places, and aims at proving that\na non-intelligent first cause, such as the pradhana of the Sa _n_ khyas, is\nunable to create and dispose.--The second adhikara _n_ a (11-17) refutes the\n\np. li\n\n[paragraph continues] Vai _s_ eshika tenet that the world originates from\natoms set in motion by the ad _ri_ sh _t_ a.--The third and fourth adhikara\n_n_ as are directed against various schools of Bauddha philosophers. Adhik.\nIII (18-27) impugns the view of the so-called sarvastitvavadins, or\nbahyarthavadins, who maintain the reality of an external as well as an\ninternal world; Adhik. IV (28-32) is directed against the vi _g \xc3\xb1_anavadins,\naccording to whom ideas are the only reality.--The last Sutra of this adhikara\n_n_ a is treated by Ramanu _g_ a as a separate adhikara _n_ a refuting the\nview of the Madhyamikas, who teach that everything is void, i.e. that nothing\nwhatever is real.--Adhik. V (33-36) is directed against the doctrine of the\n_G_ ainas; Adhik. VI (37-41) against those philosophical schools which teach\nthat a highest Lord is not the material but only the operative cause of the\nworld.\n\nThe last adhikara _n_ a of the pada (42-45) refers, according to the unanimous\nstatement of the commentators, to the doctrine of the Bhagavatas or Pa _\xc3\xb1\nk_aratras. But _S_ a _n_ kara and Ramanu _g_ a totally disagree as to the\ndrift of the Sutrakara\'s opinion regarding that system. According to the\nformer it is condemned like the systems previously referred to; according to\nthe latter it is approved of.--Sutras 42 and 43, according to both\ncommentators, raise objections against the system; Sutra 42 being directed\nagainst the doctrine that from the highest being, called Vasudeva, there is\noriginated Sa _n_ karsha _n_ a, i.e. the _g_ iva, on the ground that thereby\nthose scriptural passages would be contradicted which teach the soul\'s\neternity; and Sutra 43 impugning the doctrine that from Sa _n_ karsha _n_ a\nthere springs Pradyumna, i. e. the manas.--The Sutra on which the difference\nof interpretation turns is 44. Literally translated it runs, \'Or, on account\nof there being\' (or, \'their being\') \'knowledge and so on, there is non-\ncontradiction of that.\'--This means, according to _S_ a _n_ kara, \'Or, if in\nconsequence of the existence of knowledge and so on (on the part of Sa _n_\nkarsha _n_ a, &c. they be taken not as soul, mind, &c. but as Lords of pre-\neminent knowledge, &c.), yet there is non-contradiction of that (viz. of the\nobjection raised in Sutra 42 against the Bhagavata doctrine).\'--\n\np. lii\n\n[paragraph continues] According to Ramanu _g_ a, on the other hand, the Sutra\nhas to be explained as follows: \'Or, rather there is non-contradiction of that\n(i.e. the Pa _\xc3\xb1 k_aratra doctrine) on account of their being knowledge and so\non (i. e. on account of their being Brahman).\' Which means: Since Sa _n_\nkarsha _n_ a and so on are merely forms of manifestation of Brahman, the Pa _\xc3\xb1\nk_aratra doctrine, according to which they spring from Brahman, is not\ncontradicted.--The form of the Sutra makes it difficult for us to decide which\nof the two interpretations is the right one; it, however, appears to me that\nthe explanations of the \'va\' and of the \'tat,\' implied in Ramanu _g_ a\'s\ncomment, are more natural than those resulting from _S_ a _n_ kara\'s\ninterpretation. Nor would it be an unnatural proceeding to close the polemical\npada with a defence of that doctrine which--in spite of objections--has to be\nviewed as the true one.\n\n### P\xc3\x82DA III.\n\nThe third pada discusses the question whether the different forms of existence\nwhich, in their totality, constitute the world have an origin or not, i. e.\nwhether they are co-eternal with Brahman, or issue from it and are refunded\ninto it at stated intervals.\n\nThe first seven adhikara _n_ as treat of the five elementary substances.--\nAdhik. I (1-7) teaches that the ether is not co-eternal with Brahman, but\nsprings from it as its first effect.--Adhik. II (8) shows that air springs\nfrom ether; Adhik. IV, V, VI (10; 11; 12) that fire springs from air, water\nfrom fire, earth from water.--Adhik. III (9) explains by way of digression\nthat Brahman, which is not some special entity, but quite generally \'that\nwhich is,\' cannot have originated from anything else.\n\nAdhik. VII (13) demonstrates that the origination of one element from another\nis due, not to the latter in itself, but to Brahman acting in it.\n\nAdhik. VIII (14) teaches that the reabsorption of the elements into Brahman\ntakes place in the inverse order of their emission.\n\nAdhik. IX (15) remarks that the indicated order in which\n\np. liii\n\nthe emission and the reabsorption of the elementary substances take place is\nnot interfered with by the creation and reabsorption of the organs of the\nsoul, i.e. the sense organs and the internal organ (manas); for they also are\nof elemental nature, and as such created and retracted together with the\nelements of which they consist.\n\nThe remainder of the pada is taken up by a discussion of the nature of the\nindividual soul, the _g_ iva.--Adhik. X (16) teaches that expressions such as\n\'Devadatta is born,\' \'Devadatta has died,\' strictly apply to the body only,\nand are transferred to the soul in so far only as it is connected with a body.\n\nAdhik. XI (17) teaches that the individual soul is, according to Scripture,\npermanent, eternal, and therefore not, like the ether and the other elements,\nproduced from Brahman at the time of creation.--This Sutra is of course\ncommented on in a very different manner by _S_ a _n_ kara on the one hand and\nRamanu _g_ a on the other. According to the former, the _g_ iva is in reality\nidentical--and as such co-eternal--with Brahman; what originates is merely the\nsoul\'s connexion with its limiting adjuncts, and that connexion is moreover\nillusory.--According to Ramanu _g_ a, the _g_ iva is indeed an effect of\nBrahman, but has existed in Brahman from all eternity as an individual being\nand as a mode (prakara) of Brahman. So indeed have also the material elements;\nyet there is an important distinction owing to which the elements may be said\nto originate at the time of creation, while the same cannot be said of the\nsoul. Previously to creation the material elements exist in a subtle condition\nin which they possess none of the qualities that later on render them the\nobjects of ordinary experience; hence, when passing over into the gross state\nat the time of creation, they may be said to originate. The souls, on the\nother hand, possess at all times the same essential qualities, i.e. they are\ncognizing agents; only, whenever a new creation takes place, they associate\nthemselves with bodies, and their intelligence therewith undergoes a certain\nexpansion or development (vikasa); contrasting with the unevolved or\ncontracted state (sa _n_ ko _k_ a)\n\np. liv\n\nwhich characterised it during the preceding pralaya. But this change is not a\nchange of essential nature (svarupanyathabhava) and hence we have to\ndistinguish the souls as permanent entities from the material elements which\nat the time of each creation and reabsorption change their essential\ncharacteristics.\n\nAdhik. XII (18) defines the nature of the individual soul. The Sutra declares\nthat the soul is \' _g \xc3\xb1_a.\' This means, according to _S_ a _n_ kara, that\nintelligence or knowledge does not, as the Vai _s_ eshikas teach, constitute a\nmere attribute of the soul which in itself is essentially non-intelligent, but\nis the very essence of the soul. The soul is not a knower, but knowledge; not\nintelligent, but intelligence.--Ramanu _g_ a, on the other hand, explains \' _g\n\xc3\xb1_a\' by \' _g \xc3\xb1_at _ri_ ,\' i.e. knower, knowing agent, and considers the Sutra\nto be directed not only against the Vai _s_ eshikas, but also against those\nphilosophers who--like the Sa _n_ khyas and the Vedantins of _S_ a _n_ kara\'s\nschool--maintain that the soul is not a knowing agent, but pure _k_ aitanya.--\nThe wording of the Sutra certainly seems to favour Ramanu _g_ a\'s\ninterpretation; we can hardly imagine that an author definitely holding the\nviews of _S_ a _n_ kara should, when propounding the important dogma of the\nsoul\'s nature, use the term _g \xc3\xb1_a of which the most obvious interpretation _g\n\xc3\xb1_at _ri_ , not _g \xc3\xb1_anam.\n\nAdhik. XIII (19-32) treats the question whether the individual soul is a _n_\nu, i. e. of very minute size, or omnipresent, all-pervading (sarvagata,\nvyapin). Here, again, we meet with diametrically opposite views.--In _S_ a _n_\nkara\'s opinion the Sutras 19-38 represent the purvapaksha view, according to\nwhich the _g_ iva is a _n_ u, while Sutra 29 formulates the siddhanta, viz.\nthat the _g_ iva, which in reality is all-pervading, is spoken of as a _n_ u\nin some scriptural passages, because the qualities of the internal organ--\nwhich itself is a _n_ u--constitute the essence of the individual soul as long\nas the latter is implicated in the sa _m_ sara.--According to Ramanu _g_ a, on\nthe other hand, the first Sutra of the adhikara _n_ a gives utterance to the\nsiddhanta view, according to which the soul is of minute size; the Sutras\n20-25 confirm this view and refute objections raised against it; while the\n\np. lv\n\n[paragraph continues] Sutras 26-29 resume the question already mooted under\nSutra 18, viz. in what relation the soul as knowing agent ( _g \xc3\xb1_at _ri_ )\nstands to knowledge ( _g \xc3\xb1_ana).--In order to decide between the conflicting\nclaims of these two interpretations we must enter into some details.-- _S_ a\n_n_ kara maintains that Sutras 19-28 state and enforce a purvapaksha view,\nwhich is finally refuted in 29. What here strikes us at the outset, is the\nunusual length to which the defence of a mere prima facie view is carried; in\nno other place the Sutras take so much trouble to render plausible what is\nmeant to be rejected in the end, and an unbiassed reader will certainly feel\ninclined to think that in 19-28 we have to do, not with the preliminary\nstatement of a view finally to be abandoned, but with an elaborate bona fide\nattempt to establish and vindicate an essential dogma of the system. Still it\nis not altogether impossible that the purvapaksha should here be treated at\ngreater length than usual, and the decisive point is therefore whether we can,\nwith _S_ a _n_ kara, look upon Sutra 29 as embodying a refutation of the\npurvapaksha and thus implicitly acknowledging the doctrine that the individual\nsoul is all-pervading. Now I think there can be no doubt that _S_ a _n_ kara\'s\ninterpretation of the Sutra is exceedingly forced. Literally translated (and\nleaving out the non-essential word \'pra _g \xc3\xb1_avat\') the Sutra runs as follows:\n\'But on account of that quality (or "those qualities;" or else "on account of\nthe quality--or qualities--of that") being the essence, (there is) that\ndesignation (or "the designation of that").\' This _S_ a _n_ kara maintains to\nmean, \'Because the qualities of the buddhi are the essence of the soul in the\nsa _m_ sara state, therefore the soul itself is sometimes spoken of as a _n_\nu.\' Now, in the first place, nothing in the context warrants the explanation\nof the first \'tat\' by buddhi. And--which is more important--in the second\nplace, it is more than doubtful whether on _S_ a _n_ kara\'s own system the\nqualities of the buddhi--such as pleasure, pain, desire, aversion, &c.--can\nwith any propriety be said to constitute the essence of the soul even in the\nsa _m_ sara state. The essence of the soul in whatever state, according to _S_\na _n_ kara\'s system, is knowledge or intelligence; whatever is due to its\n\np. lvi\n\nassociation with the buddhi is non-essential or, more strictly, unreal, false.\n\nThere are no similar difficulties in the way of Ramanu _g_ a\'s interpretation\nof the adhikara _n_ a. He agrees with _S_ a _n_ kara in the explanation of\nSutras 19-35, with this difference that he views them as setting forth, not\nthe purvapaksha, but the siddhanta. Sutras 26-28 also are interpreted in a\nmanner not very different from _S_ a _n_ kara\'s, special stress being laid on\nthe distinction made by Scripture between knowledge as a mere quality and the\nsoul as a knowing agent, the substratum of knowledge. This discussion\nnaturally gives rise to the question how it is that Scripture in some places\nmakes use of the term vi _g \xc3\xb1_ana when meaning the individual soul. The answer\nis given in Sutra 29, \'The soul is designated as knowledge because it has that\nquality for its essence,\' i.e. because knowledge is the essential\ncharacteristic quality of the soul, therefore the term \'knowledge\' is employed\nhere and there to denote the soul itself. This latter interpretation gives\nrise to no doubt whatever. It closely follows the wording of the text and does\nnot necessitate any forced supplementation. The \'tu\' of the Sutra which,\naccording to _S_ a _n_ kara, is meant to discard the purvapaksha, serves on\nRamanu _g_ a\'s view to set aside a previously-raised objection; an altogether\nlegitimate assumption.\n\nOf the three remaining Sutras of the adhikara _n_ a (30-32), 30 explains,\naccording to _S_ a _n_ kara, that the soul may be called a _n_ u, since, as\nlong as it exists in the sa _m_ sara condition, it is connected with the\nbuddhi. According to Ramanu _g_ a the Sutra teaches that the soul may be\ncalled vi _g \xc3\xb1_ana because the latter constitutes its essential quality as\nlong as it exists.--Sutra 31 intimates, according to _S_ a _n_ kara, that in\nthe states of deep sleep, and so on, the soul is potentially connected with\nthe buddhi, while in the waking state that connexion becomes actually\nmanifest. The same Sutra, according to Ramanu _g_ a, teaches that _g \xc3\xb1_at _ri_\ntva is properly said to constitute the soul\'s essential nature, although it is\nactually manifested in some states of the soul only.--In Sutra 32, finally,\n_S_ a _n_ kara sees a statement of the\n\np. lvii\n\ndoctrine that, unless the soul had the buddhi for its limiting adjunct, it\nwould either be permanently cognizing or permanently non-cognizing; while,\naccording to Ramanu _g_ a, the Sutra means that the soul would either be\npermanently cognizing or permanently non-cognizing, if it were pure knowledge\nand all-pervading (instead of being _g \xc3\xb1_at _ri_ and a _n_ u, as it is in\nreality).--The three Sutras can be made to fit in with either interpretation,\nalthough it must be noted that none of them explicitly refers to the soul\'s\nconnexion with the buddhi.\n\nAdhik. XIV and XV (33-39; 40) refer to the kart _ri_ tva of the _g_ iva, i. e.\nthe question whether the soul is an agent. Sutras 33-39 clearly say that it is\nsuch. But as, according to _S_ a _n_ kara\'s system, this cannot be the final\nview,--the soul being essentially non-active, and all action belonging to the\nworld of upadhis,--he looks upon the next following Sutra (40) as constituting\nan adhikara _n_ a by itself, and teaching that the soul is an agent when\nconnected with the instruments of action, buddhi, &c., while it ceases to be\nso when dissociated from them, \'just as the carpenter acts in both ways,\' i.e.\njust as the carpenter works as long as he wields his instruments, and rests\nafter having laid them aside.--Ramanu _g_ a, perhaps more naturally, does not\nseparate Sutra 40 from the preceding Sutras, but interprets it as follows:\nActivity is indeed an essential attribute of the soul; but therefrom it does\nnot follow that the soul is always actually active, just as the carpenter,\neven when furnished with the requisite instruments, may either work or not\nwork, just as he pleases.\n\nAdhik. XVI (41, 42) teaches that the soul in its activity is dependent on the\nLord who impels it with a view to its former actions.\n\nAdhik. XVII (43-53) treats of the relation of the individual soul to Brahman.\nSutra 43 declares that the individual soul is a part (a _ms_ a) of Brahman,\nand the following Sutras show how that relation does not involve either that\nBrahman is affected by the imperfections, sufferings, &c. of the souls, or\nthat one soul has to participate in the experiences of other souls. The two\ncommentators of course take entirely\n\np. lviii\n\ndifferent views of the doctrine that the soul is a part of Brahman. According\nto Ramanu _g_ a the souls are in reality parts of Brahman 1; according to _S_\na _n_ kara the \'a _ms_ a\' of the Sutra must be understood to mean \'a _ms_ a\niva,\' \'a part as it were;\' the one universal indivisible Brahman having no\nreal parts, but appearing to be divided owing to its limiting adjuncts.--One\nSutra (50) in this adhikara _n_ a calls for special notice. According to _S_ a\n_n_ kara the words \'abhasa eva _k_ a.\' mean \'(the soul is) a mere reflection,\'\nwhich, as the commentators remark, is a statement of the so-called\npratibimbavada, i.e. the doctrine that the so-called individual soul is\nnothing but the reflection of the Self in the buddhi; while Sutra 43 had\npropounded the so-called ava _kkh_ edavada, i.e. the doctrine that the soul is\nthe highest Self in so far as limited by its adjuncts.--According to Ramanu\n_g_ a the abhasa of the Sutra has to be taken in the\n\np. lix\n\nsense of hetvabhasa, a fallacious argument, and the Sutra is explained as\nbeing directed against the reasoning of those Vedantins according to whom the\nsoul is Brahman in so far as limited by non-real adjuncts\n[1](sbe34005.htm#fn_19).\n\n### P\xc3\x82DA IV.\n\nAdhik. I, II, III (1-4; 5-6; 7) teach that the pra _n_ as (by which generic\nname are denoted the buddhindriyas, karmen-driyas, and the manas) spring from\nBrahman; are eleven in number; and are of minute size (a _n_ u).\n\nAdhik. IV, V, VI (8; 9-12; 13) inform us also that the mukhya pra _n_ a, i.e.\nthe vital air, is produced from Brahman; that it is a principle distinct from\nair in general and from the pra _n_ as discussed above; and that it is minute\n(a _n_ u).\n\nAdhik. VII and VIII (14-16; 17-19) teach that the pra _n_ as are superintended\nand guided in their activity by special divinities, and that they are\nindependent principles, not mere modifications of the mukhya pra _n_ a.\n\nAdhik. IX (20-22) declares that the evolution of names and forms (the\nnamarupavyakara _n_ a) is the work, not of the individual soul, but of the\nLord\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xlix:1](sbe34004.htm#fr_17) Lokavat, Yatha loke ra _g_ a _s_ asananuvartina\n_m_ _k_ a ra _g_ anugrahanigrahak _ri_ tasukhadukhayoge # pi na sa _s_\nariraivamatre _n_ a sasake ra _g_ any api _s_ asananuv _ri_ ttyativ _ri_\nttinimittasukhadukhayor bhokt _ri_ vaprasa _n_ ga _h_.
