Option, on account of the non-difference of result.\n\nIt has been proved that the meditation on that which truly is, the meditation\non the small ether within the heart, and so on--all of which have for their\nresult the attainment to Brahman--are separate meditations. The question now\narises whether all these meditations should be combined by each meditating\ndevotee, on account of such combination being useful to him; or whether, in\nthe absence of any use of such combination, they should be\n\np. 681\n\nundertaken optionally.--They may be combined, the Purvapakshin holds; since it\nis observed that different scriptural matters are combined even when having\none and the same result. The Agnihotra, the Dai _s_ apur _n_ amasa oblation,\nand other sacrifices, all of them have one and the same result, viz. the\npossession of the heavenly world; nevertheless, one and the same agent\nperforms them all, with a view to the greater fulness of the heavenly bliss\naimed at. So the different meditations on Brahman also may be cumulated with a\nview to greater fulness of intuition of Brahman.--This view the Sutra rejects.\nOption only between the several meditations is possible, on account of the\nnon-difference of result. For to all meditations on Brahman alike Scripture\nassigns one and the same result, viz. intuitive knowledge of Brahman, which is\nof the nature of supreme, unsurpassable bliss. 'He who knows Brahman attains\nthe Highest' (Taitt. Up. II, 1, 1), &c. The intuitive knowledge of Brahman\nconstitutes supreme, unsurpassable bliss; and if such intuition may be reached\nthrough one meditation, of what use could other meditations be? The heavenly\nworld is something limited in respect of place, time, and essential nature,\nand hence a person desirous of attaining to it may cumulate works in order to\ntake possession of it to a greater extent, and so on. But an analogous\nproceeding cannot be resorted to with regard to Brahman, which is unlimited in\nevery sense. All meditations on Brahman tend to dispel Nescience, which stands\nin the way of the intuition of Brahman, and thus equally have for their result\nthe attaining to Brahman; and hence there is option between them. In the case,\non the other hand, of those meditations which aim at other results than\nBrahman, there may either be choice between the several meditations, or they\nmay be cumulated--as one may also do in the case of sacrifices aiming at the\nattainment of the heavenly world;--for as those results are not of an infinite\nnature one may aim at realising them in a higher degree. This the next Sutra\ndeclares.\n\n58\\. But meditations aiming at objects of desire\n\np. 682\n\nmay, according to one's liking, be cumulated or not; on account of the absence\nof the former reason.\n\nThe last clause means--on account of their results not being of an infinite\nnature.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'option.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 59.
