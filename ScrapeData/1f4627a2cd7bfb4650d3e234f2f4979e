'Water (ap) is better than food. Therefore if there is not sufficient\nrain, the vital spirits fail from fear that there will be less food. But if\nthere is sufficient rain, the vital spirits rejoice, because there will be\nmuch food. This water, on assuming different forms, becomes this earth, this\nsky, this heaven, the mountains, gods and men, cattle, birds, herbs and trees,\nall beasts down to worms, midges, and ants. Water indeed assumes all these\nforms. Meditate on water.\n\n2\\. 'He who meditates on water as Brahman, obtains all wishes, he becomes\nsatisfied; he is, as it were, lord and master as far as water reaches--he who\nmeditates on water as Brahman.'\n\n'Sir, is there something better than water?'\n\n'Yes, there is something better than water.'\n\n'Sir, tell it me.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII, 11](sbe01145.htm)\n\n"
