III.\n\nDivision of the Veda into four portions, by a Vyasa, in every Dwapara age.\nList of the twenty-eight Vyasas of the present Manwantara. Meaning of the word\nBrahma.\n\nMAITREYA.--I have learnt from you, in due order, how this world is Vishn\xcc\x81u;\nhow it is in Vishn\xcc\x81u; how it is from Vishn\xcc\x81u: nothing further is to be known:\nbut I should desire to hear how the Vedas were divided, in different ages, by\nthat great being, in the form of Veda-vyasa? who were the Vyasas of their\nrespective eras? and what were the branches into which the Vedas were\ndistributed?\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--The branches of the great tree of the Vedas are so numerous,\nMaitreya, that it is impossible to describe them at length. I will give you a\nsummary account of them.\n\nIn every Dwapara (or third) age, Vishn\xcc\x81u, in the person of Vyasa, in order to\npromote the good of mankind, divides the Veda, which is properly but one, into\nmany portions: observing the limited perseverance, energy, and application of\nmortals, he makes the Veda fourfold, to adapt it to their capacities; and the\nbodily form which he assumes, in order to effect that classification, is known\nby the name of Veda-vyasa. Of the different Vyasas in the present Manwantara\n1, and the branches which they have taught, you shall have an account.\n\nTwenty-eight times have the Vedas been arranged by the great Rishis in the\nVaivaswata Manwantara in the Dwapara age, and consequently eight and twenty\nVyasas have passed away; by whom, in their respective periods, the Veda has\nbeen divided into four. In the first Dwapara age the distribution was made by\nSwayambhu (Brahma) himself; in the second, the arranger of the Veda (Veda-\nvyasa) was Prajapati (or Manu); in the third, U\xc5\x9banas; in the fourth,\nVrihaspati; in the fifth, Savitri; in the sixth, Mrityu (Death, or Yama); in\nthe seventh, Indra; in the eighth, Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha; in the ninth, Saraswata; in the\ntenth, Tridhaman; in\n\np. 273\n\nthe eleventh, Trivrishan; in the twelfth, Bharadwaja; in the thirteenth,\nAntariksha; in the fourteenth, Vapra; in the fifteenth, Trayyarun\xcc\x81a 2; in the\nsixteenth, Dhananjaya; in the [seventeenth](errata.htm#12), Kritanjaya; in the\neighteenth, Rin\xcc\x81a; in the nineteenth, Bharadwaja; in the twentieth, Gotama; in\nthe twenty-first, Uttama, also called Haryatma; in the twenty-second, Ven\xcc\x81a,\nwho is likewise named Raja\xc5\x9bravas; in the twenty-third, Soma\xc5\x9bushmapan\xcc\x81a, also\nTrin\xcc\x81avindu; in the twenty-fourth, Riksha, the descendant of Bhrigu, who is\nknown also by the name Valmiki; in the twenty-fifth, my father \xc5\x9aakti was the\nVyasa; I was the Vyasa of the twenty-sixth Dwapara, and was succeeded by\nJaratkaru; the Vyasa of the twenty-eighth, who followed him, was Krishn\xcc\x81a\nDwaipayana. These are the twenty-eight elder Vyasas, by whom, in the preceding\nDwapara ages, the Veda has been divided into four. In the next Dwapara,\nDraun\xcc\x81i (the son of Dron\xcc\x81a) will be the Vyasa, when my son, the Muni Krishn\xcc\x81a\nDwaipayana, who is the actual Vyasa, shall cease to be (in that character) 3.\n\nThe syllable Om is defined to be the eternal monosyllabic Brahma 4. The word\nBrahma is derived from the root Vriha (to increase), because it is infinite\n(spirit), and because it is the cause by which the Vedas (and\n\np. 274\n\nall things) are developed. Glory to Brahma, who is addressed by that mystic\nword, associated eternally with the triple universe 5, and who is one with the\nfour Vedas. Glory to Brahma, who, alike in the destruction and renovation of\nthe world, is called the great and mysterious cause of the intellectual\nprinciple (Mahat); who is without limit in time or space, and exempt from\ndiminution or decay; in whom (as connected with the property of darkness)\noriginates worldly illusion; and in whom resides the end of soul (fruition or\nliberation), through the properties of light and of activity (or goodness and\nfoulness). He is the refuge of those who are versed in the Sankhya philosophy;\nof those who have acquired control over their thoughts and passions. He is the\ninvisible, imperishable Brahma; varying in form, invariable in substance; the\nchief principle, self-engendered; who is said to illuminate the caverns of the\nheart; who is indivisible, radiant, undecaying, multiform. To that supreme\nBrahma be for ever adoration.\n\nThat form of Vasudeva, who is the same with supreme spirit, which is Brahma,\nand which, although diversified as threefold, is identical, is the lord, who\nis conceived by those that contemplate variety in creation to be distinct in\nall creatures. He, composed of the Rik, Sauna, and Yajur-Vedas, is at the same\ntime their essence, as he is the soul of all embodied spirits. He,\ndistinguished as consisting of the Vedas, creates the Vedas, and divides them\nby many subdivisions into branches: he is the author of those branches: he is\nthose aggregated branches; for he, the eternal lord, is the essence of true\nknowledge 6.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[272:1](vp077.htm#fr_781) The text has, 'Hear from me an account of the Vyasas\nof the different Manwantaras;' but this is inconsistent with what follows, in\nwhich the enumeration is confined to the Vaivaswata Manwantara.\n\n[273:2](vp077.htm#fr_782) This name occurs as that of one of the kings of the\nsolar dynasty, and is included by Mr. Colebrooke amongst the persons of royal\ndescent, who are mentioned as authors of hymns in the Rig-veda. As. Res. VIII.\n383.\n\n[273:3](vp077.htm#fr_783) A similar list of Vyasas is given in the Kurma and\nVayu Puran\xcc\x81as. Many of the individuals appear as authors of different hymns\nand prayers in the Vedas; and it is very possible that the greater portion, if\nnot all of them, had a real existence, being the framers or teachers of the\nreligion of the Hindus before a complete ritual was compiled.\n\n[273:4](vp077.htm#fr_784) We have already had occasion to explain the sanctity\nof this monosyllable (see [p. 1](vp035.htm#page_1), n. [1](vp035.htm#fn_98)),\nwhich ordinarily commences different portions of the Vedas, and which, as the\ntext describes it, is identified with the supreme, undefinable deity, or\nBrahma. So in the Bhagavad-gita: 'Repeating Om, the monosyllable, which is\nBrahma, and calling me to mind:' which is not exactly the same idea that is\nconveyed by Schlegel's version; 'Monosyllabum mysticum Om pronuntiando, numen\nadorans, mei memor;' where 'numen adorans,' although it may be defended as\nnecessary to the sense, is not expressed by the words of the text, nor\ncompatible with Hindu notions. In one of the MSS. employed, the transcriber\nhas evidently been afraid of desecrating this sacred monosyllable, and has\ntherefore altered the text, writing it ### instead of ###.\n\n[274:5](vp077.htm#fr_785) The daily prayers of the Brahman commence with the\nformula, Om bhuh, bhuvah, swar: Om earth, sky, heaven: these are the three\nmystical terms called Vyahritis, and are scarcely of less sanctity than the\nPran\xcc\x81ava itself. Their efficacy, and the order of their repetition preceding\nthe Gayatri, are fully detailed in Manu, II. 76-81. In the Mitakshara they are\ndirected to be twice repeated mentally, with Om prefixed to each; Om bhuh, Om\nbhuvah, Om swar; the breath being suppressed by closing the lips and nostrils.\n\n[274:6](vp077.htm#fr_786) The form or sensible type of Vasudeva is here\nconsidered to be the monosyllable Om, and which is one with the three mystical\nwords, Bhuh, Bhuvar, Swar, and with the Vedas: consequently the Vyahritis and\nthe Vedas are also forms of Vasudeva, diversified as to their typical\ncharacter, but essentially one and the same.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter IV](vp078.htm)\n\n"
