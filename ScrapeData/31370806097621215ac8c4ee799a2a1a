He sang\nof the mysterious beginning of all things:\n\nThere was neither existence, nor non-existence,  \nThe kingdom of air, nor the sky beyond.\n\nWhat was there to contain, to cover in--  \nWas it but vast, unfathomed depths of water?\n\nThere was no death there, nor Immortality.  \nNo sun was there, dividing day from night.\n\nThen was there only THAT, resting within itself.  \nApart from it, there was not anything. p. 98\n\nAt first within the darkness veiled in darkness,  \nChaos unknowable, the All lay hid.\n\nTill straightway from the formless void made manifest  \nBy the great power of heat was born that germ.  \n                         _Rigveda_ , x, 129 (Griffith\'s trans.).\n\nThe poet goes on to say that wise men had discovered in their hearts that the\ngerm of Being existed in Not Being. But who, he asked, could tell how Being\nfirst originated? The gods came later, and are unable to reveal how Creation\nbegan. He who guards the Universe knows, or mayhap he does not know.\n\nOther late Rigvedic poets summed up the eternal question regarding the Great\nUnknown in the interrogative pronoun "What?" (Ka). Men\'s minds were confronted\nby an inspiring and insoluble problem. In our own day the Agnostics say, "I do\nnot know"; but this hackneyed phrase does not reflect the spirit of enquiry\nlike the arresting "What?" of the pondering old forest hermits of ancient\nIndia.\n\nThe priests who systematized religious beliefs and practices in the\n_Brahmanas_ identified "Ka" with Praja\xc2\xb4pati, the Creator, and with Brahma,\nanother name of the Creator.\n\nIn the Vedas the word "brahma" signifies "devotion" or "the highest religious\nknowledge". Later Brahm\xc4\x83 (neuter) was applied to the World Soul, the All in\nAll, the primary substance from which all that exists has issued forth, the\nEternal Being "of which all are phases"; Brahm\xc4\x83 was the Universal Self, the\nSelf in the various Vedic gods, the Self in man, bird, beast, and fish, This\nLife of Life, the only reality, the unchangeable. This one essence or Self\n(Atman) permeates the whole Universe. Brahm\xc4\x83 is the invisible force in the\nseed, as he is the\n\np. 99\n\n[paragraph continues] "vital spark" in mobile creatures. In the _Khandogya\nUpanishad_ a young Brahman receives instruction from his father. The sage asks\nif his pupil has ever endeavoured to find out how he can hear what cannot be\nheard, how he can see what cannot be seen, and how he can know what cannot be\nknown? He then asks for the fruit of the Nyagrodha tree.\n\n"Here is one, sir."\n\n"Break it."\n\n"It is broken, sir."\n\n"What do you see there?"\n\n"Not anything, sir."\n\n"My son," said the father, "that subtile essence which you do not perceive\nthere, of that very essence this great Nyagrodha tree exists. Believe it, my\nson. That which is the subtile essence, in it all that exists has itself. It\nis the True. It is the Self; and thou, my son, art it."\n\nIn _Katha Upanishad_ a sage declares:\n\nThe whole universe trembles within the life (Brahm\xc4\x83); emanating from it\n(Brahm\xc4\x83) the universe moves on. It is a great fear, like an uplifted\nthunderbolt. Those who know it become immortal. . . .\n\nAs one is reflected in a looking-glass, so the soul is in the body; as in a\ndream, so in the world of the forefathers; as in water, so in the world of the\nGandharvas; as in a picture and in the sunshine, so in the world of Brahm\xc4\x83. .\n. .\n\nThe soul\'s being (nature) is not placed in what is visible; none beholds it by\nthe eye. . . . Through thinking it gets manifest Immortal became those who\nknow it. . . .\n\nThe soul is not to be gained by word, not by the mind, not by the eye, how\ncould it be perceived by any other than him who declares it exists?\n\nWhen all the desires cease that are cherished in his heart (intellect) then\nthe mortal becomes immortal.\n\np. 100\n\nWhen all the bonds of the heart are broken in this life, then the mortal\nbecomes immortal. . . . 1\n\nThe salvation of the soul is secured by union with Brahm\xc4\x83, the supreme and\neternal Atman (Self), "the power which receives back to itself again all\nworlds. . . . The identity of the Brahm\xc4\x83 and the Atman, of God and the Soul,\nis the fundamental thought of the entire doctrine of the Upanishads." 2\n\nVarious creation myths were framed by teachers to satisfy the desire for\nknowledge regarding the beginning of things. The divine incarnation of Brahm\xc4\x83\nis known as Brahma (masculine) Prajapati, and Narayana.\n\nIn one account we read: "At first the Universe was not anything. There was\nneither sky, nor earth, nor air. Being non-existent it resolved, \'Let me be\'.\nIt became fervent. From that fervour smoke was produced. It again became\nfervent. From that fervour fire was produced." Afterwards the fire became\n"rays" and the rays condensed like a cloud, producing the sea. A magical\nformula (Dasahotri) was next created. "Prajapati is the Dasahotri."\n\nEminently Brahmanic in character is the comment inserted here: "That man\nsucceeds who, thus knowing the power of austere abstraction (or fervour),\npractises it."\n\nWhen Prajapati arose from the primordial waters he "wept, exclaiming, \'For\nwhat purpose have I been born if (I have been born) from this which forms no\nsupport? . . .\' That (the tears) which fell into the water became the earth.\nThat which he wiped away became the air. That which he wiped away, upwards,\nbecame the sky. From the circumstance that he wept ( _arod it_), these two\nregions have the name of _rodas i_ (worlds) . . ."\n\n\n\n[![THE BIRTH OF BRAHMA: SPRINGING FROM A LOTUS ISSUING FROM VISHNU<br> <i>From\nan original Indian painting</i>.](tn/10000.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/10000.jpg)  \nTHE BIRTH OF BRAHMA: SPRINGING FROM A LOTUS ISSUING FROM VISHNU  \n_From an original Indian painting_.  \n\n(see page [124](iml12.htm#page_124))\n\n\n\np. 101\n\nPrajapati afterwards created Asuras and cast off his body, which became\ndarkness; he created men and cast off his body, which became moonlight; he\ncreated seasons and cast off his body, which became twilight; he created gods\nand cast off his body, which became day. The Asuras received milk in an\nearthen dish, men in a wooden dish, the seasons in a silver dish, and the gods\nwere given Soma in a golden dish. In the end Prajapati created Death, "a\ndevourer of creatures".\n\n"Mind (or soul, _manas_ ) was created from the non-existent\'\', adds a priestly\ncommentator. "Mind created Prajapati. Prajapati created offspring. All this,\nwhatever exists, rests absolutely on mind." 1\n\nIn another mythical account of Creation, Prajapati emerges, like the Egyptian\nHorus, from a lotus bloom floating on the primordial waters.\n\nThe most elaborate story of Creation is found in the _Laws of Manu_ , the\neponymous ancestor of mankind and the first lawgiver.\n\nIt relates that in the beginning the Self-Existent Being desired to create\nliving creatures. He first created the waters, which he called "narah", and\nthen a seed; he flung the seed into the waters, and it became a golden egg\nwhich had the splendour of the sun. From the egg came forth Brahma, Father of\nAll. Because Brahma came from the "waters", and they were his first home or\npath (ayana), he is called Narayana.\n\nThe Egyptian sun god Ra similarly rose from the primordial waters as the sun-\negg. Ptah came from the egg which, according to one myth, was laid by the\nchaos goose, and to another issued from the mouth of Khnumu 2 This conception\nmay have had origin in the story of the\n\np. 102\n\ngiant of the folk tales who concealed his soul in the egg, in the tree, and in\nvarious animal forms. There are references in Indian literature to Brahma\'s\ntree, and Brahma is identified with Purusha, who became in turn a cow, a goat,\na horse, &c., to produce living creatures.\n\nIn Manu\'s account of Creation we meet for the first time with the Maha-rishis\nor Deva-rishis, the Celestial priest poets. These are the mind-born sons of\nBrahma, who came into existence before the gods and the demons. Indeed, they\nare credited with some acts of creation. The seven or fourteen Manus were also\ncreated at the beginning. Originally there was but a single Manu, "the father\nof men".\n\nThe inclusion of the Rishis and the Manus among the deities is a late\ndevelopment of orthodox Brahmanism. They appear to represent the Fathers\n(Pitris) who were adored by ancestor worshippers. The tribal patriarch Bhrigu,\nfor instance, was a Celestial Rishi.\n\nIt must be borne in mind that more than one current of thought was operating\nduring the course of the centuries, and over a wide area, in shaping the\ncomplex religion which culminated in modern Hinduism. The history of Hinduism\nis the history of a continual struggle between the devotees of folk religion\nand the expounders of the Forest Books produced by the speculative sages who,\nin their quest for Truth, used primitive myths to illustrate profound\ndoctrinal teachings. By the common people these myths were given literal\ninterpretation. Among the priests there were also "schools of thought". One\nclass of Brahmans, it has been alleged, was concerned chiefly regarding\nritual, the mercenary results of their teachings, and the achievement of\npolitical power: men of this type appear to have been too ready\n\np. 103\n\nto effect compromises by making concession to popular opinion.\n\nJust as the _Atharva-veda_ came into existence as a book after the _Rigveda_\nhad been compiled, so did many traditional beliefs of animistic character\nreceive recognition by Brahmanic "schools" after the period of the early\n_Upanishads_. It may be, however, that we should also recognize in these\n"innovations" the influence of races which imported their own modes of\nthought, or of Aryan tribes that had been in contact for long periods with\nother civilizations known and unknown.\n\nIn endeavouring to trace the sources of foreign influences, we should not\nalways expect to find clues in the mythologies of great civilizations like\nBabylonia, Assyria, or Egypt alone. The example of the Hebrews, a people who\nnever invented anything, and yet produced the greatest sacred literature, of\nthe world, is highly suggestive in this connection. It is possible that an\nintellectual influence was exercised in early times over great conquering\nraces by humble forgotten peoples whose artifacts give no indication of their\nmental activity.\n\nIn Indian Aryan mythology we are suddenly confronted at a comparatively late\nperiod, at any rate some time after tribal settlements were effected all over\nHindustan from the Bay of Bengal to the Arabian Sea, with fully developed\nconceptions regarding the World\'s Ages and Transmigration of Souls, which, it\nis quite evident, did not originate after the Aryan conquest of Hindustan.\nBoth doctrines can be traced in Greek and Celtic (Irish) mythologies, but they\nare absent from Teutonic mythology. From what centre and what race they\noriginally emanated we are unable to discover. The problem presented is a\nfamiliar one. At the beginnings of all ancient religious systems and great\ncivilizations we catch\n\np. 104\n\nglimpses of unknown and vanishing peoples who had sowed the seeds for the\nharvests which their conquerors reaped in season.\n\nThe World\'s Ages are the "Yugas" of Brahmanism. "Of this elaborate system . .\n. no traces are found in the hymns of the _Rigveda_. Their authors were,\nindeed, familiar with the word \'yuga\', which frequently occurs in the sense of\nage, generation, or tribe. . . . The first passage of the _Rigveda_ in which\nthere is any indication of a considerable mundane period being noted is where\n\'a first\' or an earlier age (yuga) of the gods is mentioned when `the existent\nsprang from the non-existent\'. . . . In one verse of the _Atharva-veda_ ,\nhowever, the word \'yuga\' is so employed as to lead to the supposition that a\nperiod of very long duration is intended. It is there said: \'We allot to thee\na hundred, ten thousand years, two, three, four ages (yugas)\'." 1\n\nProfessor Muir traced references in the _Brahmanas_ to the belief in "Yugas"\nas "Ages", but showed that these were isolated ideas with which, however, the\nauthors of these books were becoming familiar.\n\nWhen the system of Yugas was developed by the Indian priestly mathematicians,\nthe result was as follows:--\n\nOne year of mortals is equal to one day of the gods. 12,000 divine years are\nequal to a period of four Yugas, which is thus made up, viz.:\n\nKrita Yuga,\n\n|\n\nwith its mornings and evenings,\n\n|\n\n4,800\n\n|\n\ndivine years.  \n  \n---|---|---|---  \n  \nTreta Yuga,\n\n|\n\n  "         "             "     "\n\n|\n\n3,600\n\n|\n\n      "  \n  \nDwapara Yuga,\n\n|\n\n  "         "             "     "\n\n|\n\n2,400\n\n|\n\n      "  \n  \nKali Yuga,\n\n|\n\n  "         "             "     "\n\n|\n\n_  1,200_\n\n|\n\n      "  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nMaking\n\n|\n\n12,000\n\n|\n\n  \n  \nThese 12,000 divine years equal 4,320,000 years of\n\np. 105\n\nmortals, each human year being composed of 360 days. A thousand of these\nperiods of 4,320,000 years equals one day (Kalpa) of Brahma. During "the day\nof Brahma" fourteen Manus reign: each Manu period is a Manvantara. A year of\nBrahma is composed of 360 Kalpas, and he endures for 100 of these years. One\nhalf of Brahma\'s existence has now expired.\n\nAt the end of each "day" (Kalpa) Brahma sleeps for a night of equal length,\nand before falling asleep the Universe becomes water as at the beginning. He\ncreates anew when he wakes on the morning of the next Kalpa. 1\n\nOne of the most interesting accounts of the Yugas is given in the _Mah\nabharata_. It is embedded in a narrative which reflects a phase of the\ncharacter of that great epic.\n\nBhima of the Pan\xc2\xb4davas, the human son of the wind god Vayu, once went forth to\nobtain for his beloved queen the flowers of Paradise--those Celestial lotuses\nof a thousand petals with sun-like splendour and unearthly fragrance, which\nprolong life and renew beauty: they grow in the demon-guarded woodland lake in\nthe region of Kuvera, god of treasure. Bhima hastened towards the north-east,\nfacing the wind, armed with a golden bow and snake-like arrows; like an angry\nlion he went, nor ever felt weary. Having climbed a great mountain he entered\na forest which is the haunt of demons, and he saw stately and beautiful trees,\nblossoming creepers, flowers of various hues, and birds with gorgeous plumage.\nA soft wind blew in his face; it was anointed with the perfume of Celestial\nlotus; it was as refreshing as the touch of a father\'s hand. Beautiful was\nthat sacred retreat. The great clouds spread out like wings and the mountain\nseemed to dance; shining streams adorned it like to a necklace of pearls.\n\np. 106\n\nBhima went speedily through the forest; stags, with grass in their mouths,\nlooked up at him unafraid; invisible Yakshas and Gandharvas watched him as he\nwent on swifter than the wind, and ever wondering how he could obtain the\nflowers of Paradise without delay. . . .\n\nAt length he hastened like to a hurricane, making the earth tremble under his\nfeet, and lions and tigers and elephants and bears arose and took flight from\nbefore him. Terrible was then the roaring of Bhima. Birds fluttered terror-\nstricken and flew away; in confusion arose the geese and the ducks and the\nherons and the kokilas. 1 . . . Bhima tore down branches; he struck trees and\noverthrew them; he smote and slew elephants and lions and tigers that crossed\nhis path. He blew on his war-shell and the heavens trembled; the forest was\nstricken with fear. mountain caves echoed the clamour; elephants trumpeted in\nterror and lions howled dismally.\n\nThe ape god Hanuman 2 was awakened; drowsily he yawned and he lashed his long\ntail with tempest fury until it stretched forth like a mighty pole and\nobstructed the path of Bhima. Thus the ape god, who was also a son of Vayu,\nthe wind, made Bhima to pause. Opening his red sleepy eyes, he said: "Sick am\nI, but I was slumbering sweetly; why hast thou awakened me so rudely? Whither\nart thou going? Yonder mountains are closed against thee: thou art treading\nthe path of the gods. Therefore pause and repose here: do not hasten to\ndestruction."\n\nSaid Bhima: "Who art thou? I am a Kshatriya, the son of Vayu. . . . Arise and\nlet me pass, or else thou wilt perish."\n\nHanuman said: "I am sickly and cannot move; leap over me."\n\n\n\n[![HANUMAN<br> <i>From a bronze in the Victoria and Albert\nMuseum</i>](tn/10600.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/10600.jpg)  \nHANUMAN  \n_From a bronze in the Victoria and Albert Museum_  \n\n\n\np. 107\n\nSaid Bhima: "I cannot leap over thee. It is forbidden by the Supreme Soul,\nelse would I bound as Hanuman bounded over the ocean, for I am his brother."\n\nHanuman said: "Then move my tail and go past."\n\nThen Bhima endeavoured to lift the tail of the ape god, but failed, and he\nsaid: "Who art thou that hath assumed the form of an ape; art thou a god, or a\nspirit, or a demon?"\n\nHanuman said: "I am the son of Vayu, even Hanuman. Thou art my elder brother."\n\nSaid Bhima: "I would fain behold the incomparable form thou didst assume to\nleap over the ocean."\n\nHanuman said: "At that Age the universe was not as it is now. Thou canst not\nbehold the form I erstwhile had. . . . In Krita Yuga there was one state of\nthings and in the Treta Yuga another; greater change came with Dwapara Yuga,\nand in the present Yuga there is lessening, and I am not what I have been. The\ngods, the saints, and all things that are have changed. I have conformed with\nthe tendency of the present age and the influence of Time."\n\nSaid Bhima: "I would fain learn of thee regarding the various Yugas. Speak and\ntell what thou dost know, O Hanuman."\n\nThe ape god then spake and said: "The Krita Yuga (Perfect Age) was so named\nbecause there was but one religion, and all men were saintly: therefore they\nwere not required to perform religious ceremonies. Holiness never grew less,\nand the people did not decrease. There were no gods in the Krita Yuga, and\nthere were no demons or Yakshas, and no Rakshasas or Nagas. Men neither bought\nnor sold; there were no poor and no rich; there was no need to labour, because\nall that men required was obtained by the power of will; the chief\n\np. 108\n\nvirtue was the abandonment of all worldly desires. The Krita Yuga was without\ndisease; there was no lessening with the years; there was no hatred, or\nvanity, or evil thought whatsoever; no sorrow, no fear. All mankind could\nattain to supreme blessedness. The universal soul was Narayana: he was _White_\n; he was the refuge of all and was sought for by all; the identification of\nself with the universal soul was the whole religion of the Perfect Age.\n\n"In the Treta Yuga sacrifices began, and the World Soul became _Red_ ; virtue\nlessened a quarter. Mankind sought truth and performed religious ceremonies;\nthey obtained what they desired by giving and by doing.\n\n"In the Dwapara Yuga the aspect of the World Soul was _Yellow_ : religion\nlessened one-half. The Veda, which was one (the _Rigveda_ ) in the Krita Yuga,\nwas divided into four parts, and although some had knowledge of the four\nVedas, others knew but three or one. Mind lessened, Truth declined, and there\ncame desire and diseases and calamities; because of these men had to undergo\npenances. It was a decadent Age by reason of the prevalence of sin.\n\n"In the Kali Yuga 1 the World Soul is _Black_ in hue: it is the Iron Age; only\none quarter of virtue remaineth. The world is afflicted, men turn to\nwickedness; disease cometh; all creatures degenerate; contrary effects are\nobtained by performing holy rites; change passeth over all things, and even\nthose who live through many Yugas must change also."\n\nHaving spoken thus, Hanuman bade Bhima to turn back, but Bhima said: "I cannot\nleave thee until I have gazed upon thy former shape."\n\nThen Hanuman favoured his brother, and assumed\n\np. 109\n\nhis vast body; he grew till he was high as the Vindhya mountain: he was like\nto a great golden peak with splendour equal to the sun, and he said: "I can\nassume even greater height and bulk by reason of mine own power."\n\nHaving spoken thus, Hanuman permitted Bhima to proceed on his way under the\nprotection of Vayu, god of wind. He went towards the flowery steeps of the\nsacred mountain, and at length he reached the Celestial lotus lake of Kuvera,\nwhich was shaded by trees and surrounded by lilies; the surface of the waters\nwas covered with golden lotuses which had stalks of lapis lazuli. Yakshas,\nwith big eyes, came out against Bhima, but he slew many, and those that\nremained were put to flight. He drank the waters of the lake, which renewed\nhis strength. Then he gathered the Celestial lotuses for his queen.\n\nIn this tale we discover the ancient Indo-European myth regarding the earth\'s\nprimitive races. The first age is the White Age, the second is the Red Age,\nthe third the Yellow Age, and the fourth, the present Kali Yuga, is the Black\nor Iron Age.\n\nHesiod, the Greek poet, in his _Works and Days_ , divided the mythical history\nof Greece similarly, but the order of the Ages was different; the first was\nthe Golden Age (yellow); the second was the Silver Age (white); the third was\nthe Bronze Age (red); the fourth was the Age of the Heroes; and the fifth was\nthe Age in which Hesiod lived--the Iron (black) Age. The fourth Age is\nevidently a late interpolation. Authorities consider that the Heroic Age did\nnot belong to the original scheme.\n\nIn the Greek Golden Age men lived like the gods under the rule of Kronos; they\nnever suffered the ills of old age, nor lost their strength; they feasted\ncontinually,\n\np. 110\n\nand enjoyed peace and security. The whole world prospered. When this race\npassed away they became beneficent spirits who watched over mankind and\ndistributed riches.\n\nIn the Silver Age mankind were inferior; children were reared up for a\ncentury, and died soon afterwards; sacrifice and worship was neglected. In the\nend Zeus, son of Kronos, destroyed the Silver Race.\n\nIn the Bronze Age mankind sprang from the ash. They were endowed with great\nstrength, and worked in bronze and had bronze houses: iron was unknown. But\nBronze Age men were takers of life, and at length Black Death removed them all\nto Hades.\n\nZeus created the fourth race, which was represented by the semi-divine heroes\nof a former generation; when they fell in battle on the plain of Troy and\nelsewhere, Zeus consigned them to the Islands of the Blest, where they were\nruled over by Kronos. The fifth Age may originally have been the fourth. As\nmuch is suggested by another Hesiodic legend which sets forth that all mankind\nare descended from two survivors of the Flood at the close of the Bronze Age.\n\nIn _Le Cycle Mythologique Irlandais et la Mythologie Celtique_ , the late\nProfessor D\'Arbois de Jubainville has shown that these Ages are also a feature\nof Celtic (Irish) mythology. Their order, however, differs from those in\nGreek, but it is of special interest to note that they are arranged in exactly\nthe same colour order as those given in the _Mah abharata_. The first Celtic\nAge is that of Partholon, which de Jubainville identified with the Silver Age\n(white); the second is Nemed\'s, the Bronze Age (red); the third is the Tuatha\nde Danann, the Golden Age (yellow); and the fourth is the Age of the dark\nMilesians, called after their divine ancestor Mile, son of\n\np. 111\n\n[paragraph continues] Beli, the god of night and death. The Irish claim\ndescent from the Milesians.\n\nProfessor D\'Arbois de Jubainville considered that the differences between the\nIrish and Greek versions of the ancient doctrine were due in part to the\ndevelopments which Irish legend received after the introduction of\nChristianity. There are, however, he showed, striking affinities. The Tuatha\nde Danann, for instance, like the "Golden Race" of the Greeks, became\ninvisible, and shared the dominion of the world with men, "sometimes coming to\nhelp them, sometimes disputing with them the pleasures of life".\n\nLike the early Christian annalists of Ireland, the Indian Brahmans appear to\nhave utilized the legends which were afloat among the people. Both in the\nGreek and Celtic (Irish) myths the people of the Silver Age are distinguished\nfor their folly; in the Indian Silver or White Age the people were so perfect\nand holy that it was not necessary for them to perform religious ceremonies;\nthey simply uttered the mystic word "Om". 1\n\nThere are many interesting points of resemblance between certain of the Irish\nand Indian legends. We are informed, for instance, of the Celtic St. Finnen,\nwho fasted like a Brahman, so to compel a pagan sage, Tuan MacCarell, to\nreveal the ancient history of Ireland. Tuan had lived all through the various\nmythical Ages; his father was the brother of Partholon, king of the "Silver\nRace". At the end of the First Age, Tuan was a "long-haired, grey, naked, and\nmiserable old man". One evening he fell asleep, and when he woke up he\nrejoiced to find that he had become a young stag. He saw the people of Nemed\n(the Bronze or Red Race) arriving in Ireland; he saw them passing away. Then\nhe was transformed\n\np. 112\n\ninto a black boar; afterwards he was a vulture, and in the end he became a\nfish. When he had existed as a fish for twenty years he was caught by a\nfisherman. The queen had Tuan for herself, and ate his fish form, with the\nresult that she gave birth to the sage as her son.\n\nIn similar manner Bata of the Egyptian Anpu-Bata story, 1 after existing as a\nblossom, a bull, and a tree, became the son of his unfaithful wife, who\nswallowed a chip of wood.\n\nTuan MacCarell assured St. Finnen, "in the presence of witnesses", as we are\nnaively informed, that he remembered all that happened in Ireland during the\nperiod of 1500 years covered by his various incarnations.\n\nAnother, and apparently a later version of the legend, credits the Irish sage,\nthe fair Fintan, son of Bochra, with having lived for 5550 years before the\nDeluge, and 5500 years after it. He fled to Ireland with the followers of\nCesara, granddaughter of Noah, to escape the flood. Fintan, however, was the\nonly survivor, and, according to Irish chronology, he did not die until the\nsixth century of the present era.\n\nOne of the long-lived Indian sages was named Markandeya. In the _Vana Parva_\nsection of the _Mah abharata_ he visits the exiled Pandava brethren in a\nforest, and is addressed as "the great Muni, who has seen many thousands of\nages passing away. In this world", says the chief exile, "there is no man who\nhath lived so long as thou hast. . . . Thou didst adore the Supreme Deity when\nthe Universe was dissolved, and the world was without a firmament, and there\nwere no gods and no demons. Thou didst behold the recreation of the four\norders of beings when the winds were restored to their places and the waters\nwere consigned to their proper\n\np. 113\n\nplace. . . . Neither death nor old age which causeth the body to decay have\nany power over thee."\n\nMarkandeya, who has full knowledge of the Past, the Present, and the Future,\ninforms the exiles that the Supreme Being is "great, incomprehensible,\nwonderful, and immaculate, without beginning and without end. . . . He is the\nCreator of all, but is himself Increate, and is the cause of all power." 1\n\nAfter the Universe is dissolved, all Creation is renewed, and the cycle of the\nfour Ages begins again with Krita Yuga. "A cycle of the Yugas comprises twelve\nthousand divine years. A full thousand of such cycles constitutes a Day of\nBrahma." At the end of each Day of Brahma comes "Universal Destruction".\n\nMarkandeya goes on to say that the world grows extremely sinful at the close\nof the last Kali Yuga of the Day of Brahma. Brahmans abstain from prayer and\nmeditation, and Sudras take their place. Kshatriyas and Vaisyas forget the\nduties of their castes; all men degenerate and beasts of prey increase. The\nearth is ravaged by fire, cows give little milk, fruit trees no longer\nblossom, Indra sends no rain; the world of men becomes filled with sin and\nimmorality. . . . Then the earth is swept by fire, and heavy rains fall until\nthe forests and mountains are covered over by the rising flood. All the winds\npass away; they are absorbed by the Lotus floating on the breast of the\nwaters, in which the Creator sleeps; the whole Universe is a dark expanse of\nwater.\n\nAlthough even the gods and demons have been destroyed at the eventide of the\nlast Yuga, Markandeya survives. He wanders over the face of the desolate\nwaters and becomes weary, but is unable to find a resting-place. At length he\nperceives a banyan tree; on one of\n\np. 114\n\nits boughs is a Celestial bed, and sitting on the bed is a beautiful boy whose\nface is as fair as a full-blown lotus, The boy speaks and says; "O Markandeya,\nI know that thou art weary. . . . Enter my body and secure repose. I am well\npleased with thee."\n\nMarkandeya enters the boy\'s mouth and is swallowed. In the stomach of the\nDivine One the sage beholds the whole earth (that is, India) with its cities\nand kingdoms, its rivers and forests, and its mountains and plains; he sees\nalso the gods and demons, mankind and the beasts of prey, birds and fishes and\ninsects. . . .\n\nThe sage related that he shook with fear when he beheld these wonders, and\ndesired the protection of the Supreme Being, whereat he was ejected from the\nboy\'s mouth, and found himself once again on the branch of the banyan tree in\nthe midst of the wide expanse of dark waters.\n\nMarkandeya was then informed by the Lord of All regarding the mysteries which\nhe had beheld. The Divine One spoke saying: "I have called the waters \'Nara\',\nand because they were my \'Ayana\', or home, I am Narayana, the source of all\nthings, the Eternal, the Unchangeable. I am the Creator of all things, and the\nDestroyer of all things. . . . I am all the gods. . . . Fire is my mouth, the\nearth is my feet, and the sun and the moon are my eyes; the Heaven is the\ncrown of my head, and the cardinal points are my ears; the waters are born of\nmy sweat. Space with the cardinal points are my body, and the Air is in my\nmind." 1\n\nThe Creator continues, addressing Markandeya: "I am the wind, I am the Sun, I\nam Fire. The stars are the pores of my skin, the ocean is my robe, my bed and\n\np. 115\n\nmy dwelling-place. . . ." The Divine One is the source of good and evil:\n"Lust, wrath, joy, fear, and the over-clouding of the intellect, are all\ndifferent forms of me.\n\nMen wander within my body, their senses are overwhelmed by me. . . . They move\nnot according to their own will, but as they are moved by me."\n\nMarkandeya then related that the Divine Being said: "I create myself into new\nforms. I take my birth in the families of virtuous men. . . . I create gods\nand men, and Gandharvas and Rakshas and all immobile beings, and then destroy\nthem all myself (when the time cometh). For the preservation of rectitude and\nmorality, I assume a human form; and when the season for action cometh, I\nagain assume forms that are inconceivable. In the Krita Age I become white, in\nthe Treta Age I become yellow, in the Dwapara I become red, and in the Kali\nAge I become dark in hue. . . . And when the end cometh, assuming the fierce\nform of Death, alone I destroy all the three worlds with their mobile and\nimmobile existences. . . . Alone do I set agoing the wheel of Time: I am\nformless: I am the Destroyer of all creatures: and I am the cause of all\nefforts of all my creatures." 1\n\nMarkandeya afterwards witnessed "the varied and wondrous creation starting\ninto life".\n\nThe theory of Metempsychosis, or Transmigration of Souls, is generally\nregarded as being of post-Vedic growth in India as an orthodox doctrine.\nStill, it remains an open question whether it was not professed from the\nearliest times by a section of the various peoples who entered the Punjab at\ndifferent periods and in various stages of culture. We have already seen that\nthe burial customs differed. Some consigned the dead hero to the "House of\nClay", invoking the earth to shroud him as a mother\n\np. 116\n\nwho covers her son with her robe, and the belief ultimately prevailed that\nYama, the first man, had discovered the path leading to Paradise, which became\nknown as the "Land of the Fathers" (Pitris). The fire worshippers, who\nidentified Agni with the "vital spark", cremated the dead, believing that the\nsoul passed to heaven like the burnt offering, which was the food of the gods.\nIt is apparent, therefore, that in early times sharp differences of opinion\nexisted among the tribes regarding the destiny of the soul. Other unsung\nbeliefs may have obtained ere the Brahmans grew powerful and systematized an\northodox creed. The doctrine of Metempsychosis may have had its ancient\nadherents, although these were not at first very numerous. In one passage of\nthe _Rigveda_ "the soul is spoken of as departing to the waters or the\nplants", and it "may", says Professor Macdonell, "contain the germs of the\ntheory" of Transmigration of Souls. 1\n\nThe doctrine of Metempsychosis was believed in by the Greeks and the Celts.\nAccording to Herodotus the former borrowed it from Egypt, and although some\nhave cast doubt on the existence of the theory in Egypt, there are evidences\nthat it obtained there as in early Aryanized India among sections of the\npeople. 2 It is possible that the doctrine is traceable to a remote racial\ninfluence regarding which no direct evidence survives.\n\nAll that we know definitely regarding the definite acceptance of the theory in\nIndia is that in _Satapatha Brahmana_ it is pointedly referred to as a\nnecessary element of orthodox religion. The teacher declares that those who\nperform sacrificial rites are born again and attain to immortality, while\nthose who neglect to sacrifice pass through successive existences until Death\nultimately claims them.\n\np. 117\n\nAccording to Upanishadic belief the successive rebirths in the world are forms\nof punishment for sins committed, or a course of preparation for the highest\nstate of existence.\n\nIn the code of Manu it is laid down, for instance, that he who steals gold\nbecomes a rat, he who steals uncooked food a hedgehog, he who steals honey a\nstinging insect; a murderer may become a tiger, or have to pass through\nsuccessive states of existence as a camel, a dog, a pig, a goat, &c.; other\nwrongdoers may have to exist as grass, trees, worms, snails, &c. As soon as a\nman died, it was believed that he was reborn as a child, or a reptile, as the\ncase might be. Sufferings endured by the living were believed to be\nretribution for sins committed in a former life.\n\nAnother form of this belief had evidently some connection with lunar worship,\nor, at any rate, with the recognition of the influence exercised by the moon\nover life in all its phases; it is declared in the _Upanishads_ that "all who\nleave this world go directly to the moon. By their lives its waxing crescent\nis increased, and by means of its waning it brings them to a second birth. But\nthe moon is also the gate of the heavenly world, and he who can answer the\nquestions of the moon is allowed to pass beyond it. He who can give no answer\nis turned to rain by the moon and rained down upon the earth. He is born again\nhere below, as worm or fly, or fish or bird, or lion, or boar or animal with\nteeth, or tiger, or man, or anything else in one or another place, according\nto his works and his knowledge." 1\n\nBelief in Metempsychosis ultimately prevailed all over India, and it is fully\naccepted by Hinduism in our own day. Brahmans now teach that the destiny of\nthe soul depends on the mental attitude of the dying person: if\n\np. 118\n\nhis thoughts are centred on Brahma he enters the state of everlasting bliss,\nbeing absorbed in the World Soul; if, however, he should happen to think of a\nfavourite animal or a human friend, the soul will be reborn as a cow, a horse,\nor a dog, or it may enter the body of a newly-born child and be destined to\nendure once again the ills that flesh is heir to.\n\nIn Egypt, according to Herodotus, the adherents of the Transmigration theory\nbelieved that the soul passed through many states of existence, until after a\nperiod of about three thousand years it once again reanimated the mummy. The\nGreeks similarly taught that "the soul continues its journey, alternating\nbetween a separate, unrestrained existence and fresh reincarnation, round the\nwide circle of necessity, as the companion of many bodies of men and animals".\n1 According to Caesar, the Gauls professed the doctrine of Metempsychosis\nquite freely. 2\n\nBoth in India and in Egypt the ancient doctrine of Metempsychosis was coloured\nby the theologies of the various cults which had accepted it. It has survived,\nhowever, in primitive form in the folk tales. Apparently the early exponents\nof the doctrine took no account of beginning or end; they simply recognized\n"the wide circle of necessity" round which the soul wandered, just as the\nworshippers of primitive nature gods and goddesses recognized the eternity of\nmatter by symbolizing earth, air, and heaven as deities long ere they had\nconceived of a single act of creation.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[100:1](iml11.htm#fr_146) Dr. E.
