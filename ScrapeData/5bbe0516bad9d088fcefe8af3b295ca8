Karma.--The propelling force which conducts the Soul with its potential\nfunctions through endless incarnations as man, god, beast, or vegetable, is\nthe _karm \xc4\x81\xc5\x9braya,_ the substrate of its _karma_ or works. By "work" is\nunderstood not only every act of will, and of body in obedience to will, but\nalso every act of ideation in which the subject of thought posits a non-self\nin opposition to itself, for in this false duality begins the Will, desire,\nattachment of the soul to its fetters of finitude, and therewith moral\nblindness. Every such act transforms itself into a positive force acting upon\nthe soul, and demanding a corresponding requital of good for good and evil for\nevil in future experiences; and the sum of these forces at the end of each\nlife determines the form of birth in the next incarnation. 1\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[46:1](brk23.htm#fr_1) See especially B.A. III. ii. 13 (probably the earliest\nassertion of this theory as a solution of the problem of moral character), IV.\niv. 2-6, Ch.
