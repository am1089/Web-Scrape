And on account of its form being mentioned.\n\nSubsequently to the passage, 'Higher than the high Imperishable,' we meet (in\nthe passage, 'From him is born breath,' &c.) with a description of the\ncreation of all things, from breath down to earth, and then with a statement\nof the form of this same source of beings as consisting of all created beings,\n'Fire is his head, his eyes the sun and the moon, the quarters his ears, his\nspeech the Vedas disclosed, the wind his breath, his heart the universe; from\nhis feet came the earth; he is indeed the inner Self of all things.' This\nstatement of form can refer only to the\n\np. 141\n\nhighest Lord, and not either to the embodied soul, which, on account of its\nsmall power, cannot be the cause of all effects, or to the pradhana, which\ncannot be the inner Self of all beings. We therefore conclude that the source\nof all beings is the highest Lord, not either of the other two.--But wherefrom\ndo you conclude that the quoted declaration of form refers to the source of\nall beings?--From the general topic, we reply. The word 'he' (in the clause,\n'He is indeed the inner Self of all things') connects the passage with the\ngeneral topic. As the source of all beings constitutes the general topic, the\nwhole passage, from 'From him is born breath,' up to, 'He is the inner Self of\nall beings,' refers to that same source. Similarly, when in ordinary\nconversation a certain teacher forms the general topic of the talk, the\nphrase, 'Study under him; he knows the Veda and the Veda _n_ gas thoroughly,'\nas a matter of course, refers to that same teacher.--But how can a bodily form\nbe ascribed to the source of all beings which is characterised by invisibility\nand similar attributes?--The statement as to its nature, we reply, is made for\nthe purpose of showing that the source of all beings is the Self of all\nbeings, not of showing that it is of a bodily nature. The case is analogous to\nsuch passages as, 'I am food, I am food, I am the eater of food' (Taitt. Up.\nIII, 10, 6).--Others, however, are of opinion 1 that the statement quoted does\nnot refer to the source of all beings, because that to which it refers is\nspoken of as something produced. For, on the one hand, the immediately\npreceding passage ('From him is born health, mind, and all organs of sense,\nether, air, light, water, and the earth, the support of all') speaks of the\naggregate of beings from air down to earth as something produced, and, on the\nother\n\np. 142\n\nhand, a passage met with later on ('From him comes Agni, the sun being his\nfuel,' up to 'All herbs and juices') expresses itself to the same purpose. How\nthen should all at once, in the midst of these two passages (which refer to\nthe creation), a statement be made about the nature of the source of all\nbeings?--The attribute of being the Self of all beings, (which above was said\nto be mentioned in the passage about the creation, 'Fire is his head,' &c., is\nnot mentioned there but) is stated only later on in a passage subsequent to\nthat which refers to the creation, viz. 'The Person is all this, sacrifice,'\n&c. (II, 1, 10).--Now, we see that _s_ ruti as well as sm _ri_ ti speaks of\nthe birth of Pra _g_ apati, whose body is this threefold world; compare _Ri_\ng-veda Sa _m_ h. X, 121, 1, 'Hira _n_ yagarbha arose in the beginning; he was\nthe one born Lord of things existing. He established the earth and this sky;\nto what God shall we offer our oblation?' where the expression 'arose' means\n'he was born.' And in sm _ri_ ti we read, 'He is the first embodied one, he is\ncalled the Person; as the primal creator of the beings Brahman was evolved in\nthe beginning.' This Person which is (not the original Brahman but) an effect\n(like other created beings) may be called the internal Self of all beings (as\nit is called in II, 1, 4), because in the form of the Self of breath it abides\nin the Selfs of all beings.--On this latter explanation (according to which\nthe passage, 'Fire is his head,' &c., does not describe the nature of the\nhighest Lord, and can therefore not be referred to in the Sutra) the\ndeclaration as to the Lord being the 'nature' of all which is contained in the\npassage, 'The Person is all this, sacrifice,' &c., must be taken as the reason\nfor establishing the highest Lord, (i.e. as the passage which, according to\nthe Sutra, proves that the source of all beings is the highest Lord 1.)\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[141:1](sbe34060.htm#fr_155) V _ri_ ttik _ri_ dvyakhyam dushayati, Go. \xc3\x82n.;\nekade _s_ ina _m_ dushayati, \xc3\x82nanda Giri; tad etat\nparamatenakshepasamadhanabhya _m_ vyakhyaya svamatena vya _k_ ash _t_ e, puna\n_h_ _s_ abdo#pi purvasmad vi _s_ esha _m_ dyotayann asyesh _t_ ata _m_ su _k_\nayati, Bhamati.--The statement of the two former commentators must be\nunderstood to mean--in agreement with the Bhamati\\--that _S_ a _n_ kara is now\ngoing to refute the preceding explanation by the statement of his own view.\nThus Go. \xc3\x82n. later on explains 'asmin pakshe' by 'svapakshe.'\n\n[142:1](sbe34060.htm#fr_156) The question is to what passage the\n'rupopanyasat' of the Sutra refers.--According to the opinion set forth first\nit refers to Mu. Up. II, 1, 4 ff.--But, according to the second view, II, 1, 4\nto II, 1, 9, cannot refer to the source of all beings, i.e. the highest Self,\nbecause that entire passage describes the creation, the inner Self of which is\nnot the highest Self but Pra _g_ apati, i.e. the Hira _n_ yagarbha or\nSutratman of the later Vedanta, who is himself an p. 143 'effect,' and who is\ncalled the inner Self, because he is the breath of life (pra _n_ a) in\neverything.--Hence the Sutra must be connected with another passage, and that\npassage is found in II, 1, 10, where it is said that the Person (i.e. the\nhighest Self) is all this, &c.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2, 24](sbe34061.htm)\n\n"
