(The soul is an agent) also because it is designated as such with regard\nto actions; if it were not such, there would be a change of designation.\n\nThe quality of being an agent belongs to the soul for that reason also that\nthe sacred texts speak of its agency in sacred and secular actions.\n'Understanding performs the sacrifice, it performs all acts' (Taitt. Up. II,\n5).--But, an objection may here be raised, we have seen that the word\n'understanding' applies to the buddhi; how then can it indicate the\ncircumstance of the soul being an agent?--The soul only, we reply, is\ndesignated there, not the buddhi. If the soul were not meant to be designated,\nthere would be a change in the designation, i.e. the passage would run,\n'through understanding it performs,' &c. For we see that in another passage\nwhere the buddhi is meant the word 'understanding' is exhibited in the\ninstrumental form, 'Having through the understanding (intelligence) of these\nsenses taken all understanding' (B _ri_. Up. II, 1, 17). In the passage under\ndiscussion, on the other hand, the word 'understanding' is given in the case\ncharacteristic of the agent (viz. the nominative), and therefore indicates the\nSelf which is distinct from the buddhi. Hence your objection is not valid.--\nAnother objection is raised. If the soul in so far as distinct from the buddhi\nwere the agent, it would, because it is independent, bring about exclusively\nwhat is pleasant and useful to itself, not the opposite. We, however, observe\nthat it does bring about the opposite also. But such an unrestricted\nproceeding does not become\n\np. 51\n\nthe independent Self.--To this objection the following Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 37](sbe38038.htm)\n\n"
