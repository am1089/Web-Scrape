With these words Krishnu put his own necklace on\nher neck; and, seating her on his left, sounded his shell, when the attendants\nof Sissoopal and Joorasindhoo all started from their sleep; and it was spread\nabroad, throughout the whole city, that Huri had carried off Rookmunee. Rajas\nSissoopal and Joorasindhoo, having heard of Rookmunee\'s abduction from the\nguards they sent with her, were exceedingly enraged; and putting on their\ncoats of mail and helmets, and fastening their waist-bands, and arming\nthemselves completely, followed in quick pursuit of Krishnu with all their\nforces, with a view of engaging him. When they came near, poising their\nweapons, they exclaimed, "Why are you running away, stand and take your arms\nand fight? Chutrees and heroical brave men do not show their backs in the\nfield."\n\nOn hearing these words, O great king! the descendants of Judoo faced about,\nand the engagement began on both\n\np. 227\n\nsides. The youthful Rookmunee was at that time greatly alarmed; and, covering\nherself with a veil, shed tears, and heaved deep sighs, looking intently on\nthe face of her beloved, she thought to herself, "That he endured all these\ntroubles for her sake." Krishnu, who is acquainted with the secrets of the\nheart, knowing the thoughts of her mind, said, "O lovely Rookmunee! why art\nthou afraid? In thy very sight I will slay the army of demons, and remove the\nburthens of the earth, do not be at all anxious."\n\nHaving recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--Raja! the\ngods, seated at that time in their chariots in the sky, beheld the descendants\nof Judoo fighting with the demons, and a mighty battle raging, Krishnu stood\nlooking on, whilst Bulram fought. Kettle-drums sounded, bards sang war-songs,\npanegyrists celebrated the praises of the combatants, horsemen encountered\nhorsemen, elephant riders elephant riders, charioteers charioteers, and foot\nsoldiers foot soldiers. In every direction heroes and brave men attacked and\nengaged each other; and cowards, leaving the field, ran off with their lives.\nThe wounded stood writhing with pain, headless trunks, with swords in their\nhands, wandered about in every direction, and bodies were heaped upon bodies,\nfrom which a river of blood flowed; the elephants, which were lying dead here\nand there, appeared like islands, and their trunks like alligators. Muhadeo,\naccompanied by ghosts, goblins and spirits, wore a garland of heads, which he\nhad selected; and vultures, jackals and dogs tore and fought with each other\nfor the corpses of the slain, and, rending them in pieces, devoured them.\nCrows plucked out eyes from their sockets, and carried them off. At length, in\nsight of the gods, Bulram destroyed the army of demons, in the manner that a\nhusbandman would reap a field. Joorasindhoo and Sissoopal, when their whole\narmy was destroyed, took a few wounded men with them, and flying arrived and\nmade a stand at the same place. Sissoopal, expressing\n\np. 228\n\ngreat regret and shaking his head, said to Joorasindhoo, "It is not right I\nshould live, having lost my honour, and brought disgrace on my family; with\nyour permission, therefore, I will return to the battle, and die fighting; if\nnot, I will take up my abode in the forest; I will become a devotee, and\nabandon all worldly hopes; my good name and character are lost, why should I\nlive, and preserve life by submitting to disgrace?" Joorasindhoo replied, "O\ngreat king! you are a man of understanding and great experience; how shall I\nadvise you? The wise do not allow themselves to be troubled by the events that\noccur, because another being is the disposer of good and evil; man has no\npower, but is under the authority of, and subservient to, another; as the\njuggler makes the wooden puppet dance as he pleases, so is man in the power of\nhis Maker, who acts according to his own will, for which reason you should not\nbe elated in prosperity, nor depressed in adversity; but look upon everything\nas a dream. I advanced seventeen times to attack the city of Muttra with\ntwenty-three complete armies, and my whole army was seventeen times slain by\nthis Krishnu; I did not give myself any uneasiness, nor was I at all elated\nwhen on the eighteenth occasion I destroyed his forces, he ran away and\nclimbed up a hill, which I set on fire; it is impossible to know how he\nescaped with life, his nature is not to be understood." Joorasindhoo after\nthis again said, "O great king! it is advisable for you to submit to this\npresent crisis of your affairs. There is a saying, that if life is spared, all\nwill go well: as it happened to me to be defeated seventeen times, and again a\nvictory on the eighteenth occasion. Consult, therefore, your own welfare and\ninterest, and act accordingly, and abandon obstinacy."\n\nWhen Joorasindhoo, O great king! had given this advice, Sissoopal recovered\nconfidence, and, taking with him all his armed followers, who had escaped\nwounded, he accompanied Joorasindhoo in a state of great sorrow and regret,\nand they went\n\np. 229\n\nthence after their defeat. And now listen to the account of what happened in\nthe family of Sissoopal. As his mother began to prepare festive entertainments\nin expectation of the arrival of her son, some one sneezed in front of her,\nand her right eye began to palpitate; when she beheld this unfavourable omen,\nher forehead throbbed.; and in the mean while, some one came and said to her,\n"Your son\'s army has all been destroyed, and he has not obtained the bride,\nand he is running away thence to save his life." On hearing these words,\nSissoopal\'s mother was greatly troubled, and became speechless.\n\nRookum having heard of the flight of Sissoopal and Joorasindhoo, came and sat\nin his court in a state of great rage and excitement; and began to say in the\npresence of all, "How can Krishnu escape from me? I will now go and slay him,\nassure as my name is Rookum: otherwise, I will not return to Koondulpore." O\ngreat king! having made this vow, Rookum took with him a complete army,\nconsisting of 109,350 foot, 65,610 horse, 21,870 chariots and 21,870\nelephants; and advanced to fight with Shree Krishnu Chund, and surrounded the\narmy of the descendants of Judoo. He then said to his followers, "Do you\ndestroy all the descendants of Judoo, and I will go on in advance, and bring\nKrishnu here alive and bound."\n\nOn hearing these words, his followers began to fight with the descendants of\nJudoo; and he went forward in his chariot, and, on approaching Shree Krishnu\nChund, called out, "O deceitful villager! what do you know of the nature and\nduties of government? In the same way, that in your childhood you stole milk\nand curds, you have come and carried off a beautiful woman; I am not a\nherdsman, inhabitant of Bruj." With these words, he seized some arrows, and\ndischarged three poisoned ones from his bow at Krishnu. Perceiving the arrows\ncoming towards him, Shree Krishnu Chund warded them off, (or stopped them\nmidway). Rookum\n\np. 230\n\ndischarged more arrows, with the same result on the part of Krishnu; who,\nhaving prepared and arranged his bow, let fly several arrows with such force,\nthat the charioteers and all the horses of the chariot were destroyed; and\nRookum\'s bow was pierced, and fell from his hand. Huri after this cut in\npieces and cast on the ground all the weapons Rookum used against him. He was\nexceedingly enraged, and seizing a shield and sword, leaped from his chariot,\nand rushed towards Shree Krishnu Chund, as a mad jackal would rush upon an\nelephant, or as a moth would fly into a lamp. On coming up, he attacked the\nchariot of Huri with a club, who immediately laid hold of and bound him, and\nwas on the point of killing him, when Rookmunee Jee interposed, and said, "Do\nnot kill him, he is my brother, release, lord, your servant; what can such a\nblind fool know, who looks upon the husband of Luchmee as a mortal. You are\nthe first and eternal god of devotion; and have became manifest, O divine\nbeing! for the sake of your worshippers. How could this silly creature\nrecognize you, who are celebrated as the compassionate benefactor of the\npoor?" Having thus spoken she added, "Good men take no thought of the faults\nof fools and children, as the lion pays no regard to the barking of a dog. If\nyou kill him, my father will be afflicted; you ought not, therefore, to put\nhim to death. Wherever your feet fall, all men live happily; it would be\nstrange indeed, if having such a relation as you, Raja Bheekmuk should suffer\ngrief on account of his son."\n\nO great king! after this speech, Rookmunee Jee once again thus said, "You have\nshown great affection towards my relation, in having laid hold of and bound\nhim, and in being prepared with a sword in your hand to kill him." Afterwards,\nshe was very much agitated, and trembling, with downcast eyes and sobbing, she\nfell at his feet, and throwing open her breast, began to say, "O Krishnu! give\nmy brother to me as an act of charity; and acquire renown for yourself in the\nworld by this deed." Shree Krishnu Chund Jee\'s anger\n\np. 231\n\nwas entirely cooled by hearing these words, and looking towards Rookmunee, he\ndid not deprive Rookum of life; but made a sign to his charioteer, who\nimmediately pulled off his turban, and tying his hands behind his back shaved\nhis moustachios, beard and head, leaving seven locks of hair, by which he\nfastened him to the chariot.\n\nHaving recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said, O great\nking! Shree Krishnu Jee thus treated Rookum; and Buldeo, having slain and put\nto flight all the armies of the demons, hastened to meet his brother with the\nsame celerity as a white elephant runs about a place, abounding with water\nlilies, destroying devouring, and scattering about the flowers in great fury.\nAt length he reached the presence of Krishnu; and perceiving that Rookum was\nbound, addressed Shree Krishnu Jee with great warmth and anger, "What is this\nyou have done in binding your brother-in-law? You cannot leave off your bad\nhabits; you have shown little sense in binding him; and by this act, Krishnu,\nyou have severed the relationship, and brought a stain upon the family of\nJudoo; who will now connect himself with us? When he came before you to fight,\nwhy did you not expostulate with him, and send him back?"\n\nO great king! having thus spoken, Bulram Jee released Rookum; and, having\nentered into explanations with him, dismissed him with the greatest\npoliteness; and then joining his hands, Bulram, the abode of delight, said to\nRookmunee Jee with great humility of manner, "O beauteous Rookmunee! it has\nnot been our fault, that your brother has been subjected to this treatment; it\nis the recompense of his deeds in a former birth; and it is honourable for\nChutrees, and their usual practice to arrange armies, and fight for land,\nwealth and women with each other; be not displeased at what has happened, but\nbelieve what I say, defeat and victory happen to him according to his fate,\nand this world is a sea of troubles; who from his entrance into it tastes of\nhappiness?\n\np. 232\n\nbut men, being under the influence of delusion, estimate according to their\ndifferent judgments, and form opinions of good and evil, pain and pleasure,\nvictory and defeat, good and bad fortune. The soul, however, has no sensation\nof delight or misery, from these things do not vex yourself with the thought\nof your brother having been disfigured. The wise consider the soul as\nimmortal, and the body as mortal. For this reason, the soul is not affected by\nany disgrace that happens to the body."\n\nHaving narrated thus much, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja Pureechit,--O\nincarnation of justice! when Bulram Jee had thus advised Rookmunee, she having\nheard and reflected upon what he had said, was ashamed in presence of her\nhusband\'s elder brother. In the midst of the army, she said to her husband, "O\nlord of Bruj! drive on the chariot;" she covered herself with a veil, and\nspoke sweetly to Huri, "Buldeo is standing before us; O husband! drive on the\nchariot quickly."\n\nWhen Shree Rookmunee Jee had thus spoken, Shree Krishnu Chund Jee directed the\nchariot towards Dwarka; and Rookum having returned to his own people, and\nsuffering great anxiety, said to them, "I started from Koondulpore with this\nvow, that I would go and destroy Krishnu and Bulram and all the descendants of\nJudoo, and bring Rookmunee here, my vow has not been accomplished; and I have\ninstead of performing it, lost my honour; I will not survive this disgrace,\nbut abandoning my country and home, and family and all worldly affairs, will\nbecome a religious ascetic, and seek death somewhere." When Rookum had thus\nspoken, one of his household said, "O great king! you are a great hero, and\nvery renowned, it was their good fortune to have escaped alive from your\nhands, they are indebted to the strength of their fate for this escape,\notherwise, what enemy could encounter you, and escape alive? You are possessed\nof great understanding; why, therefore, do you think of\n\np. 233\n\npursuing such a course as you have mentioned? Sometimes defeat occurs, and\nsometimes victory, but it is the attribute of the brave and resolute not to\nlose confidence. Suppose your enemy, has escaped to-day, we will destroy him\nsome other time." When he had thus advised him, Rookum replied, "I have been\ndefeated by them, and my good name is gone, and I am most heartily ashamed;\nmay I die, if I return to Koondulpore, but I will establish some other\nvillage."\n\nHaving thus spoken, he peopled a city with inhabitants, to which he conveyed\nhis children, wife and wealth. He named it Bhojkutoo; in this manner Rookum\nestablished a village.\n\nO great king! Rookum dwelt there, being at enmity with the Raja Bheekmuk; and\nShree Krishnu Chund and Buldeo Jee proceeded on their journey and arrived near\nDwarka. The inhabitants of the city received intimation of their approach by\nthe dust, caused by their chariots, which reached the sky. When they knew that\nHuri was coming, they completely arranged and prepared the city for his\nreception. Its beauty equalled that of the three worlds, who can attempt to\ndescribe it; at that time there were rejoicings in every house. Pillars of\nplantain were fixed at each entrance, golden waterpots filled with water and\nsprouts, were placed in every direction; flags and banners waved; garlands and\nwreaths of flowers were fastened in different places, and crowds of women were\nstanding in every market, road and cross-road, holding lamps with four wicks;\nand the Raja Oogursen, accompanied by all the descendants of Judoo, advancing\nin musical procession to meet them according to the prescribed forms and\nceremonies, escorted Bulram, the abode of pleasure, and Shree Krishnu Chund,\nthe root of joy, to the city. The beauty of the scene baffles description; all\nthe inhabitants, both men and women, were delighted. They came into the\npresence of Krishnu and presented their offerings. And the women sang songs of\nrejoicing at the gates and doors of their houses, and from sheds and house-\ntops, and performing the ceremony\n\np. 234\n\n[paragraph continues] " _Arta_ ," [showered](errata.htm#12) down flowers.\nShree Krishnu Chund and Buldeo Jee displayed towards all great fascination of\nmanner, and delighted them greatly; and progressing in this manner, they\narrived at the palace and took up their abode there. Some days afterwards,\nShree Krishnu Jee went one day to the royal court, where Rajas Oorgursen,\nSoorsen, Basoodeo and all the grandees of the family of Judoo were sitting;\nand, having made a salutation, said, in their presence, "O great kings! it is\ncalled a devil\'s marriage, if a man carry off a woman, after having gained a\nvictory in battle."\n\nOn hearing these words, Soorsen Jee sent for a family priest; and explaining\nto him said, "Fix a day for Shree Krishnu\'s "marriage." He immediately drew\nforth an almanac, and having decided upon a favourable month, day, time,\nconstellation and an auspicious period with respect to the sun and moon, fixed\nupon a day for the marriage. Raja Oogursen then gave the order to his\nministers to collect all necessary materials, and make preparations for the\nmarriage; and sitting down wrote letters of invitation to the members of the\nfamily of Koroo and Judoo, and all Rajas, far and near; and despatched them by\nthe hands of brahmins. O great king! all the Rajas were highly gratified at\nreceiving the letters of invitation; and started off, accompanied by brahmins,\npundits, bards and beggars.\n\nWhen Raja Bheekmuk received intelligence of these events, he delivered over to\na brahmin many dresses, arms, ornaments, studded with gems, chariots,\nelephants, horses and male and female servants, sedan chairs; and, having made\na vow in his mind respecting the giving his daughter in marriage, with very\ngreat humility, sent off all the different presents to Dwarka. The Rajas of\nthe different countries came, and the brahmin also arrived, whom the Raja\nBheekmuk had despatched with presents. The beautiful appearance of Dwarka at\nthat time cannot be described. When at length the marriage-day came, after\nhaving gone through all the prescribed\n\np. 235\n\nforms and ceremonies, they conducted the bride to a building, erected for the\noccasion, and adorned with flowers, and placed her upon a seat; and all the\ngreat chiefs and members of the family of Judoo came, and sat there also, at\nthat time, pundits recited the Vedas; Huri circled round with Rookmunee. Drums\nand other musical instruments resounded; the delighted gods rained down\nflowers. Demi-gods, saints, bards and celestial musicians were all spectators\nfrom the sky. The wives of the gods, ascending their chariots; and collecting\ntogether, and stooping down, all sang songs of rejoicing. Taking hold of\nRookmunee by the hand, Krishnu circled her round, and seated her on his left.\nThey untied the knot, and re-turned the board used for sitting on at meals,\nand then performed pooja to the family Devee. Huri, unloosing Rookmunee\'s\nbracelet, joined with her in the sport of eating milk, boiled rice and sugar\ntogether. The lord of the universe was highly delighted; all the spectators\nwere filled with joy, and pronounced benedictions: "May the marriage of Huri\nand "Rookmunee last long, whose natures have imbibed the spirit of nectar."\nThey gave presents to all the brahmins, who came; and robes of honour to the\nbards and panegyrists; and, having allowed them to take leave, had all the\nRajas of the different countries escorted back.\n\nHaving recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great\nking! whoever shall read or hear of the actions of Huri and Rookmunee; and,\nhaving heard and read, shall remember them, will obtain religion, absolution\nfrom sin and celebrity. Moreover, whatever benefits are to be gained by the\nsacrifice of a horse and other sacrifices; by the gift of a cow and other\ngifts; by bathing in the Ganges and other holy bathing places; by going on a\npilgrimage to Prag and other holy spots; will be bestowed on hearing and\nreciting this history.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LVI](psa57.htm)\n\n'
