eighteen  \nThe years of life that I have seen;  \nAnd Rama, best of all alive,  \nHas passed of years a score and five-  \nRama the great and gentle, through  \nAll region famed as pure and true,  \nLarge-eyed and mighty-armed and tall.  \nWith tender heart that cares for all.  \nBut Das'aratha, led astray  \nBy woman's wile and passion's sway,  \nBy his strong love of her impelled,  \nThe consecrating rites withheld.  \nWhen, hopeful of the promised grace,  \nMy Rama sought his father's face,  \nThe queen Kaikeyi, ill at ease,  \nSpoke to my lord brief words like these:  \n'Hear, son of Raghu, hear from me  \nThe words thy father says to thee:  \n'I yield this day to Bharat's hand,  \nFree from all foes, this ancient land.  \nFly from this home no longer thine,  \nAnd dwell in woods five years and nine.  \nLive in the forest and maintain  \nMine honour pure from falsehood's stain.'  \nThen Rama spoke, untouched by dread;  \n'Yea, it shall be as thou hast said '.  \nAnd answered, faithful to his vows,  \nObeying Das'aratha's spouse:  \n'The offered realm I would not take,  \nBut still keep true the words he spake.'  \nThus, gentle Brahman, Rama still  \nClung to his vow with firmest will.  \nAnd valiant Lakshman, dear to fame,  \nHis brother by a younger dame,  \nBold victor in the deadly fray,  \nWould follow Rama on his way.  \nOn sternest vows his heart was set,  \nAnd he, a youthful anchoret,  \nBound up in twisted coil his hair  \nAnd took the garb which hermits wear;  \nThen with his bow to guard us, he  \nWent forth with Rama and with me.  \nBy Queen Kaikeyi's art bereft  \nThe kingdom and our home we left,  \nAnd bound by stern religious vows  \nWe sought this shade of forest boughs.  \nNow, best of Brahmans, here we tread  \nThese pathless regions dark and dread.  \nBut come, refresh thy soul, and rest  \nHere for a while an honoured guest.  \nFor he, my lord, will soon be here  \nWith fresh supply of woodland cheer,  \nLarge store of venison of the buck,  \nOr some great boar his hand has struck.  \nMeanwhile, O stranger, grant my prayer:  \nThy name, thy race, thy birth declare,  \nAnd why with no companion thou  \nRoamest in Dandak forest now.'  \nThus questioned Sita, Rama's dame.  \nThen fierce the stranger's answer came:  \n'Lord of the giant legions, he  \nFrom whom celestial armies flee,--  \nThe dread of hell and earth and sky,  \nRavan the Rakshas king am I.  \nNow when thy gold-like form I view  \nArrayed in silks of amber hue,  \nMy love, O thou of perfect mould,  \nFor all my dames is dead and cold.  \nA thousand fairest women, torn  \nFrom many a land my home adorn.  \nBut come, loveliest lady, be  \nThe queen of every dame and me.  \nMy city Lanka, glorious town,  \nLooks from a mountain's forehead down  \n\np. 285  \n\nWhere ocean with his flash and foam  \nBeats madly on mine island home.  \nWith me, O Sita, shalt thou rove  \nDelighted through each shady grove,  \nNor shall thy happy breast retain  \nFond memory of this life of pain.  \nIn gay attire, a glittering band*,  \nFive thousand maids shall round thee stand,  \nAnd serve thee at thy beck and sign,  \nIf thou, fair Sita, wilt be mine.'  \n   Then forth her noble passion broke  \nAs thus in turn the lady spoke:  \n'Me, me the wife of Rama, him  \nThe lion lord with lion's limb,  \nStrong as the sea, firm as the rock,  \nLike Indra in the battle shook.  \nTue lord of each auspicious sign,  \nThe glory of his princely line,  \nLike some fair Bodh tree strong and tall,  \nThe noblest and the best of all,  \nRama, the heir of happy fate  \nWho keeps his word inviolate,  \nLord of the lion gait, possessed  \nOf mighty arm and ample chest,  \nRama the lion-warrior, him  \nWhose moon bright face no fear can dim,  \nRama, his bridled passions' lord,  \nThe darling whom his sire adored,--  \nMe, me the true and loving dame  \nOf Rama, prince of deathless fame--  \nMe wouldst, thou vainly woo and press?  \nA jackal woo a lioness!  \nSteal from the sun his glory! such  \nThy hope Lord Rama's wife to touch.  \nHa! Thou hast seen the trees of gold,  \nThe sign which dying eyes behold,  \nThus seeking, weary of thy life,  \nTo win the love of Rama's wife.  \nFool! wilt thou dare to rend away  \nThe famished lion's bleeding prey,  \nOr from the threatening jaws to take  \nThe fang of some envenomed snake?  \nWhat, wouldst thou shake with puny hand  \nMount Mandar, 1 towering o'er the laud,  \nPut poison to thy lips and think  \nThe deadly cup a harmless drink?  \nWith pointed needle touch thine eye,  \nA razor to thy tongue apply,  \nWho wouldst pollute with impious touch  \nThe wife whom Rama loves so much?  \nBe round thy neck a millstone tied,  \nAnd swim the sea from side to side;  \nOr raising both thy hands on high  \nPluck sun and moon from yonder sky;  \nOr let the kindled flame be pressed,  \nWrapt in thy garment, to thy breast;  \n\nMore wild the thought that seeks to win  \nRama's dear wife who knows not sin.  \nThe fool who thinks with idle aim  \nTo gain the love of Rama's dame,  \nWith dark and desperate footing makes  \nHis way o'er points of iron stakes.  \nAs Ocean to a bubbling spring,  \nThe lion to a fox, the king  \nOf all the birds that ply the wing  \n   To an ignoble crow  \nAs gold to lead of little price,  \nAs to the drainings of the rice  \nThe drink they quaff in Paradise,  \n   The Amrit's heavenly flow,  \nAs sandal dust with perfume sweet  \nIs to the mire that soils our feet,  \n   A tiger to a cat,  \nAs the white swan is to the owl,  \nThe peacock to the waterfowl,  \n   An eagle to a bat,  \nSuch is my lord compared with thee;  \nAnd when with bow and arrows he,  \nMighty as Indra's self shall see  \n   His foeman, armed to slay.  \nThou, death-doomed like the fly that sips  \nThe oil that on the altar drips,  \nShalt cast the morsel from thy lips  \n   And lose thy half-won prey.'  \nThus in high scorn the lady flung  \nThe biting arrows of her tongue  \nIn bitter words that pierced and stung  \n   The rover of the night.  \nShe ceased. Her gentle cheek grew pale,  \nHer loosened limbs began to fail,  \nAnd like a plantain in the gale  \n   She trembled with affright.  \nHe terrible as Death stood nigh,  \nAnd watched with fierce exulting eye  \n   The fear that shook her frame.  \nTo terrify the lady more,  \nHe counted all his triumphs o'er,  \nProclaimed the titles that he bore,  \n   His pedigree and name.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[285:1](ry245.htm#fr_502) The mountain which was used by the Gods as a\nchurning stick at the Churning of the Ocean.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XLVIII: Ravan's Speech.](ry246.htm)\n\n"
