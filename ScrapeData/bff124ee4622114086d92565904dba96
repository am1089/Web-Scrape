Owing to modification.\n\nThis means--owing to the essential nature of modification (pari _n_ ama). The\nmodification taught in our system is not such as to introduce imperfections\ninto the highest Brahman, on the contrary it confers on it limitless glory.\nFor our teaching as to Brahman's modification is as follows.\n\np. 403\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahman--essentially antagonistic to all evil, of\nuniform goodness, differing in nature from all beings other than itself, all-\nknowing, endowed with the power of immediately realising all its purposes, in\neternal possession of all it wishes for, supremely blessed--has for its body\nthe entire universe, with all its sentient and non-sentient beings--the\nuniverse being for it a plaything as it were--and constitutes the Self of the\nUniverse. Now, when this world which forms Brahman's body has been gradually\nreabsorbed into Brahman, each constituent element being refunded into its\nimmediate cause, so that in the end there remains only the highly subtle,\nelementary matter which Scripture calls Darkness; and when this so-called\nDarkness itself, by assuming a form so extremely subtle that it hardly\ndeserves to be called something separate from Brahman, of which it constitutes\nthe body, has become one with Brahman; then Brahman invested with this ultra-\nsubtle body forms the resolve 'May I again possess a world-body constituted by\nall sentient and non-sentient beings, distinguished by names and forms just as\nin the previous aeon,' and modifies (pari _n_ amayati) itself by gradually\nevolving the world-body in the inverse order in which reabsorption had taken\nplace.\n\nAll Vedanta-texts teach such modification or change on Brahman's part. There\nis, e.g., the text in the B _ri_ had-\xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka which declares that the\nwhole world constitutes the body of Brahman and that Brahman is its Self. That\ntext teaches that earth, water, fire, sky, air, heaven, sun, the regions, moon\nand stars, ether, darkness, light, all beings, breath, speech, eye, ear, mind,\nskin, knowledge form the body of Brahman which abides within them as their\nSelf and Ruler. Thus in the Ka _n_ va-text; the Madhyandina-text reads 'the\nSelf' instead of 'knowledge'; and adds the worlds, sacrifices and vedas. The\nparallel passage in the Subala-Upanishad adds to the beings enumerated as\nconstituting Brahman's body in the B _ri_ had-\xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka, buddhi, aha _m_\nkara, the mind ( _k_ itta), the Un-evolved (avyakta), the Imperishable\n(akshara), and concludes 'He who moves within death, of whom death is the\nbody,\n\np. 404\n\nwhom death does not know, he is the inner Self of all, free from all evil,\ndivine, the one god Naraya _n_ a. The term 'Death' here denotes matter in its\nextremely subtle form, which in other texts is called Darkness; as we infer\nfrom the order of enumeration in another passage in the same Upanishad, 'the\nUnevolved is merged in the Imperishable, the Imperishable in Darkness.' That\nthis Darkness is called 'Death' is due to the fact that it obscures the\nunderstanding of all souls and thus is harmful to them. The full text in the\nSubala-Up. declaring the successive absorption of all the beings forming\nBrahman's body is as follows, 'The earth is merged in water, water in fire,\nfire in air, air in the ether, the ether in the sense-organs, the sense-organs\nin the tanmatras, the tanmatras in the gross elements, the gross elements in\nthe great principle, the great principle in the Unevolved, the Unevolved in\nthe Imperishable; the Imperishable is merged in Darkness; Darkness becomes one\nwith the highest Divinity.' That even in the state of non-separation (to which\nthe texts refer as 'becoming one') non-sentient matter as well as sentient\nbeings, together with the impressions of their former deeds, persists in an\nextremely subtle form, will be shown under II, 1, 35. We have thus a Brahman\nall-knowing, of the nature of supreme bliss and so on, one and without a\nsecond, having for its body all sentient and non-sentient beings abiding in an\nextremely subtle condition and having become 'one' with the Supreme Self in so\nfar as they cannot be designated as something separate from him; and of this\nBrahman Scripture records that it forms the resolve of becoming many--in so\nfar, namely, as investing itself with a body consisting of all sentient and\nnon-sentient beings in their gross, manifest state which admits of\ndistinctions of name and form--and thereupon modifies (pari _n_ ama) itself\ninto the form of the world. This is distinctly indicated in the Taittiriya-\nUpanishad, where Brahman is at first described as 'The True, knowledge,\ninfinite,' as 'the Self of bliss which is different from the Self of\nUnderstanding,' as 'he who bestows bliss'; and where the text further on says,\n'He desired, may I be many, may\n\np. 405\n\n[paragraph continues] I grow forth. He brooded over himself, and having thus\nbrooded he sent forth all whatever there is. Having sent forth he entered it.\nHaving entered it he became sat and tyat, defined and undefined, supported and\nnon-supported, knowledge and non-knowledge, real and unreal.' The 'brooding'\nreferred to in this text denotes knowing, viz. reflection on the shape and\ncharacter of the previous world which Brahman is about to reproduce. Compare\nthe text 'whose brooding consists of knowledge' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 9). The meaning\ntherefore is that Brahman, having an inward intuition of the characteristics\nof the former world, creates the new world on the same pattern. That Brahman\nin all kalpas again and again creates the same world is generally known from\n_S_ ruti and Sm _ri_ ti. Cp. 'As the creator formerly made sun and moon, and\nsky and earth, and the atmosphere and the heavenly world,' and 'whatever\nvarious signs of the seasons are seen in succession, the same appear again and\nagain in successive yugas and kalpas.'\n\nThe sense of the Taittiriya-text therefore is as follows. The highest Self,\nwhich in itself is of the nature of unlimited knowledge and bliss, has for its\nbody all sentient and non-sentient beings--instruments of sport for him as it\nwere--in so subtle a form that they may be called non-existing; and as they\nare his body he may be said to consist of them (tan-maya). Then desirous of\nproviding himself with an infinity of playthings of all kinds he, by a series\nof steps beginning with Prak _ri_ ti and the aggregate of souls and leading\ndown to the elements in their gross state, so modifies himself as to have\nthose elements for his body--when he is said to consist of them--and thus\nappears in the form of our world containing what the text denotes as sat and\ntyat, i.e. all intelligent and non-intelligent things, from gods down to\nplants and stones. When the text says that the Self having entered into it\nbecame sat and tyat, the meaning is that the highest Self, which in its causal\nstate had been the universal Self, abides, in its effected state also, as the\nSelf of the different substances undergoing changes and thus becomes this and\nthat. While the highest Self thus\n\np. 406\n\nundergoes a change--in the form of a world comprising the whole aggregate of\nsentient and non-sentient beings--all imperfection and suffering are limited\nto the sentient beings constituting part of its body, and all change is\nrestricted to the non-sentient things which constitute another part. The\nhighest Self is _effected_ in that sense only that it is the ruling principle,\nand hence the Self, of matter and souls in their gross or evolved state; but\njust on account of being this, viz. their inner Ruler and Self, it is in no\nway touched by their imperfections and changes. Consisting of unlimited\nknowledge and bliss he for ever abides in his uniform nature, engaged in the\nsport of making this world go round. This is the purport of the clause 'it\nbecame the real and the unreal': although undergoing a change into the\nmultiplicity of actual sentient and non-sentient things, Brahman at the same\ntime was the Real, i.e. that which is free from all shadow of imperfection,\nconsisting of nothing but pure knowledge and bliss. That all beings, sentient\nand non-sentient, and whether in their non-evolved or evolved states, are mere\nplaythings of Brahman, and that the creation and reabsorption of the world are\nonly his sport, this has been expressly declared by Dvaipayana, Para _s_ ara\nand other _Ri_ shis,'Know that all transitory beings, from the Unevolved down\nto individual things, are a mere play of Hari'; 'View his action like that of\na playful child,' &c. The Sutrakara will distinctly enounce the same view in\nII, 1, 33. With a similar view the text 'from that the Lord of Maya sends\nforth all this; and in that the other is bound by Maya' ( _S_ vet. Up. IV, 9),\nrefers to Prak _ri_ ti and soul, which together constitute the body of\nBrahman, as things different from Brahman, although then, i.e. at the time of\na pralaya, they are one with Brahman in so far as their extreme subtlety does\nnot admit of their being conceived as separate; this it does to the end of\nsuggesting that even when Brahman undergoes the change into the shape of this\nworld, all changes exclusively belong to non-sentient matter which is a mode\nof Brahman, and all imperfections and sufferings to the individual souls which\nalso are modes of Brahman. The\n\np. 407\n\ntext has to be viewed as agreeing in meaning with 'that Self made itself.' Of\na similar purport is the account given in Manu, 'He being desirous to send\nforth from his body beings of many kinds, first with a thought created the\nwaters and placed his seed in them' (I, 8).\n\nIt is in this way that room is found for those texts also which proclaim\nBrahman to be free from all imperfection and all change. It thus remains a\nsettled conclusion that Brahman by itself constitutes the material as well as\nthe operative cause of the world.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 28.
