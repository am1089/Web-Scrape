That Self is a bank 2, a boundary, so that these worlds may not be\nconfounded. Day and night do not pass that bank, nor old age, death, and\ngrief; neither good nor evil deeds. All evil-doers turn back from it, for the\nworld of Brahman is free from all evil.\n\n2\\. Therefore he who has crossed that bank, if blind, ceases to be blind; if\nwounded, ceases to be wounded; if afflicted, ceases to be afflicted. Therefore\nwhen that bank has been crossed, night becomes day indeed, for the world of\nBrahman is lighted up once for all 3.\n\n3\\. And that world of Brahman belongs to those\n\np. 131\n\nonly who find it by abstinence--for them there is freedom in all the worlds.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[130:2](sbe01164.htm#fr_335) Setu, generally translated by bridge, was\noriginally a bank of earth (m _ri_ dadimaya), thrown up to serve as a pathway\n(pons) through water or a swamp. Such banks exist still in many places, and\nthey serve at the same time as boundaries (maryada) between fields belonging\nto different properties. Cf. Mait. Up. VII, 7; Ka _th_ Up. III, 2; Talav.
