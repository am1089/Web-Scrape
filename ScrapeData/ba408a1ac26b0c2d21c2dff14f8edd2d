Agni _G_ atavedas, the god, has looked on the dawns that shine with all\ntheir might [1](sbe46103.htm#an_4:14:1:1). Come hither, O Nasatyas\n[2](sbe46103.htm#an_4:14:1:2), wide-ruling (gods), on your chariot to this our\nsacrifice.\n\n2\\. The god Savit _ri_ has sent his shine upward, producing light for the\nwhole world. The Sun, shining with his rays, has filled Heaven and Earth and\nthe air.\n\n3\\. The red one [1](sbe46103.htm#an_4:14:3:1), carrying hither (bliss)\n[2](sbe46103.htm#an_4:14:3:2), has come with her light, the great, brilliant\none, shining with her rays. Ushas, the goddess, awakening (all beings) to\nwelfare, goes along on her well-yoked chariot.\n\n4\\. May those chariots and horses, most ready to drive, drive you\n[1](sbe46103.htm#an_4:14:4:1) hither at the break of dawn. For these Somas are\nfor you that you may drink the honey-drink [2](sbe46103.htm#an_4:14:4:2).\nRejoice, O manly ones, at this sacrifice.\n\n5\xcc\x85 IV, 13, 5.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi and metre.--No verse of this hymn occurs in the other Sa _m_\nhitas. On the parallelism in which IV, 14 stands to IV, 13, see the\nintroductory note on IV, 13.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. On mahobhi _h_ , see vol. xxxii, p. 196 seq. (I, 165, 5, note 3). Here\nthe word refers to the powerful light of\n\np. 359\n\nthe dawn, not of Agni, cf. VI, 64, 2. usha _h_ devi ro _k_ amana mahobhi _h_.\n\nNote 2. On the mention of the Nasatyas (A _s_ vins) in this connection,\ncompare the introductory note on IV, 13.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. The Dawn as before.\n\nNote 2. That an object like 'bliss' is to be supplied, is shown by such\npassages as I, 48, 9. usha _h_ \xe2\x80\xa6 avahanti bhu\xc2\xb4ri asmabhyam saubhagam; I, 92,\n3. (the Dawns) isham vahanti _h_ suk _r i_te suda\xc2\xb4nave; I, 113, 15. (the Dawn)\navahanti poshya va\xc2\xb4rya _n_ i.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. The text has the dual of the pronoun. The A _s_ vins are addressed.\n\nNote 2. It is the peculiar character of the A _s_ vins that they drink madhu;\nsee Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, vol. i, p. 239 seq. H. O., Religion des\nVeda, p. 208, note 4; p. 367, note 2.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 15](sbe46104.htm)\n\n"
