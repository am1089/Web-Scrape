Ah, that I  \nBy Lakshman's side might sink and die  \nLife, war and conquest, all are vain  \nIf Lakshman lies in battle slain.  \nWhy will those eyes my glances shun?  \nHast thou no word of answer, none?  \nAh, as thy noble spirit flown  \nAnd gone to other worlds alone?  \nCould thou not let thy brother seek  \nThose worlds with thee? O speak, O speak!  \nRise up once more, my brother, rise,  \nLook on me with thy loving eyes.  \nWere not thy steps beside me still  \n\nIn gloomy wood, on breezy hill?  \nDid not thy gentle care assuage  \nThy brother's grief and fitful rage?  \nDidst thou not all his troubles share,  \nHis guide and comfort in despair?'  \n\nAs Rama, vanquished, wept and sighed  \nThe Vanar chieftain thus replied:  \n'Great Prince, unmanly thoughts dismiss,  \nNor yield thy soul to grief like this,  \nIn vain those burning tears are shed:  \nOur glory Lakshman is not dead.  \nDeath on his brow no mark has set,  \nWhere beauty's lustre lingers yet.  \nClear is the skin, and tender hues  \nOf lotus flowers his palms suifuse.  \nO Rama, cheer thy trembling heart;  \nNot thus do life and body part,  \nNow, Hanuman, to thee I speak:  \nHie hence to tall Mahodaya's  [1](ry477.htm#fn_1017) peak  \nWhere herbs of sovereign virtue grow  \nWhich life and health and strength bestow  \nBring thou the leaves to balm his pain,  \nAnd Lakshman shall be well again.'  \n\nHe ceased: the Wind-God's son obeyed  \nSwift through the clouds his way he made.  \nHe reached the hill, nor stayed to find  \nThe wondrous herbs of healing kind,  \nFrom its broad base the mount he tore  \nWith all the shrubs and trees it bore,  \nSped through the clouds again and showed  \nTo wise Sushen his woodv load.  [2](ry477.htm#fn_1018)  \nSushen in wonder viewed the hill,  \nAnd culled the sovereign salve of ill.  \nSoon as the healing herb he found,  \nThe fragrant leaves he crushed and ground.  \nThen over Lakshman's face he bent,  \nWho, healed and strengthened by the scent  \nOf that blest herb divinely sweet,  \nRose fresh and lusty on his feet.  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto CIII.: Indra's Car.](ry477.htm)\n\n"
