They also say, 'If that performer of a long sacrificial session--\nto wit, he who (regularly) offers the Agnihotra--were to die whilst staying\nabroad, are they to sacrifice for him or not?' Now, some indeed think that\n(his Agnihotra) should be offered till they get home 1; but let him not do so,\nfor that (fire) does not submit thereto that they should offer to it, as for\nthe burning of a dead body: it is rather to sacrifice and oblations that it\nsubmits, and, unable to endure it, it stays by him with impatience.\n\n12:5:1:22\\. And some, indeed, say, 'They (the fires) should lie in the very\nsame condition, kept up (with fuel) but without offering being made on them;'\nbut let him not do so, for that (fire) does not submit thereto that they\nshould kindle it as for the burning of a dead body: it is rather to sacrifice\nand oblations that it submits, and, unable to endure it, it stays by him with\nimpatience.\n\n12:5:1:33\\. And some, indeed, having lifted the two fires\n\np. 198\n\non the churning-sticks, lay them down, and churn it (the new fire) out on his\nbeing brought (home); but let him not do so, for that (fire) does not submit\nthereto that they should churn it out as for the burning of a dead body: it is\nrather to sacrifice and oblations that it submits, and, unable to endure it,\nit stays by him with impatience.\n\n12:5:1:44\\. Let him rather proceed thus:--let him hid them seek for a cow\nsuckling an adopted calf, and let him make offering with milk from her; for\ntainted is that milk which comes from a cow suckling an adopted calf, and\ntainted is the Agnihotra of one who is dead: by thus removing the tainted by\nthe tainted, he becomes more glorious.\n\n12:5:1:55\\. Concerning this there also is a simile:--if two smashed cars were\nto (be made to) unite there would be at least one (fit) for driving.\n\n12:5:1:66\\. The procedure of this same Agnihotra (is as follows):--He causes\nher to be milked whilst eastward invested 1; for, sacrificially invested, one\ngets (the Agnihotra-cow) milked for the gods, but in the case of the Fathers\nit is done thus.\n\n12:5:1:77\\. He does not put (the milk) on the (burning) coals 2; for were he\nto put it on coals he would be doing (what is done) for the gods: having\nshifted some hot cinders from the Garhapatya towards the right (south) side,\nhe puts it thereon, and thus makes it to be sacred to the Fathers.\n\np. 199\n\n12:5:1:88\\. He does not cause the light (of a burning straw) to fall upon it,\nnor does he pour water to it; for were he to make the light fall on it, and to\npour water to it, he would be doing-(what is done) for the gods. He does not\ntake it off thrice, setting it down each time 1; for were he take it off\nthrice, setting it down each time, he would be doing (what is done) for the\ngods: only once he takes it off drawing it downwards 2, and thus makes it to\nbe sacred to the Fathers.\n\n12:5:1:99\\. He does not say, 'I will ladle out 3!' nor does he ladle out (the\nmilk) four times; for were he to say 'I will ladle out!' and were he to ladle\nout four times, he would be doing (what is done) for the gods: only once he\nsilently turns it upside down (into the spoon), and thus makes it to be sacred\nto the Fathers.\n\n12:5:1:1010\\. He does not take it (to the \xc3\x82havaniya) whilst holding a\nkindling-stick over (the handle of the spoon 4); for were he to take it\n(there) whilst holding a kindling-stick over it, he would be doing (what is\ndone) for the gods: he takes it whilst holding (a billet) underneath, and thus\nmakes it to be sacred to the Fathers.\n\n12:5:1:1111\\. He does not pass along the north side of the Garhapatya 5, for\nwere he to pass along the north\n\np. 200\n\nside of the Garhapatya he would be doing (what is done) for the gods: he\npasses along the south side of the Garhapatya, and thus makes it to be sacred\nto the Fathers.\n\n12:5:1:1212\\. And that sacrificial grass which (ordinarily) is lying with its\ntops towards the north he lays so as to have its tops towards the south, and\nthus makes (the offering) to be sacred to the Fathers. And having put a\nkindling-stick on the \xc3\x82havaniya, and bent his left knee, he silently turns\n(the ladle) once upside down (pouring the milk into the fire) and thus makes\nit to be sacred to the Fathers. He neither shakes (the spoon) upwards 1, nor\nwipes it, nor does he eat (the milk left in the spoon), nor does he throw it\nout: he thus makes it to be sacred to the Fathers.\n\n12:5:1:1313\\. They also say, 'If that performer of a long sacrificial session\n--to wit, he who (regularly) offers the Agnihotra--were to die whilst staying\nabroad, how would they supply him with his fires?' Well, some, having burnt\nhim, bring (the bones) home and make the fires smell him as he is brought; but\nlet him not do this, for this would be as if he were to seek to cause the seed\nimplanted in one womb to be born forth from another womb. Having brought home\nthe bones, let him throw them on a black antelope skin, and arrange them in\naccordance with man's form, and having covered them with wool and sprinkled\nwith ghee, let him by burning unite him\n\np. 201\n\nwith his fires: he thus causes him to be born from his own (maternal) womb.\n\n12:5:1:1414\\. And some, indeed, burn him in (ordinary) fire (procured) in the\nvillage; but let him not do this, for such fire is a promiscuous eater, an\neater of raw flesh: it would be capable of devouring him completely, together\nwith his sons and his cattle.\n\n12:5:1:1515\\. And some, indeed, burn him in a forest-fire; but let him not do\nthis; for such fire is unappeased: it would be capable of burning him up\ntogether with his sons and his cattle.\n\n12:5:1:1616\\. And some, indeed, burn him in a firebrand; but let him not do\nthis; for such fire belongs to Rudra: it would be capable of destroying him\ntogether with his sons and his cattle.\n\n12:5:1:1717\\. And some, indeed, build up a funeral pile in the midst of the\n(three) fires, and, by burning him, unite him with his fires, thinking,\n'There,--to wit, in the midst of his fires,--assuredly is the Sacrificer's\nabode.' But let him not do this; for if in that case any one were to say of\nhim, 'Verily, this one has caused a cutting up in the middle of the village:\nthe cutting up of him will speedily come about 1: he will weep for his\ndearest;' then that would indeed be likely to come to pass.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[197:1](sbe44062.htm#fr_535) Prof. Delbruck, Altind. Syntax, p. 430, takes\n'aganto _h_ ' in the sense,--'(thinking) he may still come;' but cf. Katy.\nXXV, 8, 9 with comm., according to which, in case of an Agnihotrin dying away\nfrom home, his people are--if the place of his death be somewhere near his\nhome--to take the body there; but if it be far from home, they are to kindle a\nfire by 'churning' and burn the body, and having collected the bones and taken\nthem home, they are there to perform the punardaha, or second cremation; and\nin either case the Agnihotra is to be performed regularly for the deceased, in\nthe evening and morning, 'till the body or the bones arrive at the house (g\n_ri_ hagamanaparyantam).' The force of 'iti' here evidently is,--(thinking,)\n'we will do so until the home-coming.' Harisvamin rightly resolves 'aganto _h_\n' by 'a aganto _h_.'\n\n[198:1](sbe44062.htm#fr_536) That is, wearing the Brahma _n_ ical cord over\nthe right shoulder, and under the left arm; instead of over the left shoulder,\nand under the right arm as is done at the sacrifice.\n\n[198:2](sbe44062.htm#fr_537) For boiling the milk for the Agnihotra burning\ncoals are shifted northwards from the Garhapatya, and the pot placed thereon;\nsee part i, p. 330, note.\n\n[199:1](sbe44062.htm#fr_538) When a spoonful of water has been added to the\nAgnihotra-milk, and the light of a burning straw again thrown on it, the pot\nis taken up three several times and put down each time further north on the\nhot ashes; see part i, p. 331, note 1.\n\n[199:2](sbe44062.htm#fr_539) That is, down from the ashes--towards the south\n(where the Fathers, or departed ancestors, are supposed to reside),--whilst in\nthe case of the ordinary Agnihotra he would be shifting the pot more and more\nupwards, or northwards. Cf. Katy. XXV, 8, 10.\n\n[199:3](sbe44062.htm#fr_540) See [XII, 4, 2, 8](sbe44059.htm#12:4:2:8).\n\n[199:4](sbe44062.htm#fr_541) See part i, p. 331, note 4.\n\n[199:5](sbe44062.htm#fr_542) Possibly we ought to translate,--he does not go\nto the north side of the Garhapatya (but to the south side)--that is, if he\nmakes p. 200 two oblations, not only on the \xc3\x82havaniya, but also on the\nGarhapatya (as well as on the Dakshi _n_ agni), in which case the Adhvaryu\nwould be standing north (or rather north-west) of the fire. Cf. Katy. IV, 14,\n22-25.\n\n[200:1](sbe44062.htm#fr_543) Ordinarily, after the second libation, the priest\ntwice jerks the spoon upwards, and then lays it down on a bunch of grass.\n\n[201:1](sbe44062.htm#fr_544) The burning of the dead body seems to be compared\nhere with the cutting up of the victim which is done outside the sacrificial\nground. Harisvamin, indeed, takes 'grama' here, not in the sense of 'village,'\nbut in that of 'agnisamuha'--in the midst of the (set of) sacrificial fires--\nwhich, if it were possible, would certainly make the comparison even more\nstriking.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XII, 5, 2.
