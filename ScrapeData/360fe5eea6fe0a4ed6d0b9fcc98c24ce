The Devi said:--"Hear, ye Immortals! My words with attention, that I am\nnow going to speak to you, hearing which will enable the Jivas to realise My\nEssence. Before the creation, I, only I, existed; nothing else was existent\nthen. My Real Self is known by the names Chit, Sambit (Intelligence), Para\nBrahma and others. My \xc3\x82tman is beyond mind, beyond thought, beyond any name or\nmark, without any parallel, and beyond birth, death or any other change or\ntransformation. My Self has one inherent power called Maya. This Maya is not\nexistent, nor non-existent, nor can it be called both. This unspeakable\nsubstance Maya always exists (till the final emancipation or Mok _s_ a).\n\nMaya can be destroyed by Brahmna J\xc3\xb1ana; so it can not be called existent,\nagain if Maya does not exist, the practical world catinot exist. So it cannot\nbe called non-existent. Of course it cannot be called both, for it would\ninvolve contradictions. This Maya (without beginning but with end at the time\nof Mok _s_ a) naturally arises as heat comes out of fire, as the rays come out\nof the Sun and as the cooling rays come out of the Moon. Just as all the\nKarmas of the Jivas dissolve in deep sleep (S\'u _s_ upti), so at the time of\nPralaya or the General Dissolution, the Karmas of the Jivas, the Jivas and\nTime all become merged, in one uniform mass in this great Maya. United with My\nS\'akti, I am the Cause of this world; this S\'akti has this defect that it has\nthe power of hiding Me, its Originator.\n\nI am Nirgu _n_ a. And when I am united with my S\'akti, Maya, 1 become Saguns,\nthe Great Cause of this world. This Maya is divided into two, Vidya and\nAvidya. Avidya Maya hides Me; whereas Vidya Maya does not. Avidya creates\nwhereas Vidya Maya liberates.\n\nMaya united with Chaitanya (Intelligence), _i. e._ , Chidabhasa is the\nefficient cause of this Universe; whereas Maya reduced to and united with five\noriginal elements is the material Cause of the Universe. Some call this Maya\ntapas; some call Her inert, material; some call Her knowledge; some call Her\nMaya, Pradhana, Prakriti, Aja (unborn) and sonic others call Her S\'akti. The\nS\'aiva authors call Her Vimars\'a and the other Vedantists call Her Avidya; in\nshort, this Maya is in the heads of all the Pundits. This Maya is called\nvarious in the Nigamas.\n\np. 738\n\nThat which is seen is inert; for this reason Maya is Ja _d_ a (inert) and as\nthe knowledge it conveys is destroyed, it is false. Chaitanya (Intelligence)\nis not seen; if It were seen, it would have been Ja _d_ a. Chaitanya is self-\nluminous; not illumined by any other source. Were It so, Its Enlightener would\nhave to be illumined by some other. thing and so the fallacy of Anavastha\ncreeps in (an endless series of causes and effects). Again one thing cannot be\nthe actor and the thing, acted upon (being contrary to each other); so\nChaitanya cannot be illumined by itself. So It is Self-luminous; and it\nillumines Sun, Moon, etc., as a lamp is self-luminous and illumines other\nobjects. So, O Mountain! This My Intelligence is established as eternal and\neverlasting. The waking, dreaming and deep sleep states do not remain constant\nbut the sense of "I" remains the same, whether in waking, dreaming or deep\nsleep state; its anomaly is never felt. (The Bauddhas say that) The sense of\nntelligence, J\xc3\xb1ana, is also not, felt; there in the absence of it; so what is\nexistent is also temporarily existent. But (it can then be argued that) then\nthe Witness by which that absence is sensed, that Intelligence, in the shape\nof the Witness, is eternal. So the Pundits of all the reasonable S\'astras\ndeclare that Samvit (Intelligence) is Eternal and it is Blissful the fountain\nof all love. Never the Jivas or embodied souls feel "I am not"; but "I am"\nthis feeling is deeply established in the soul as Love. Thus it is clearly\nevident that I am quite Separate from anything else which are all false. Also\nI am one continuous (no interval or separation existing within Me). Again\nJ\xc3\xb1ana is not the Dharma (the natural quality) of \xc3\x82tman but it is of the very\nnature of \xc3\x82tman. If J\xc3\xb1ana ware the Dharma of \xc3\x82tman, then J\xc3\xb1ana would have been\nmaterial; so J\xc3\xb1ana is immaterial. If (for argument\'s sake) J\xc3\xb1ana be\ndenominated as material, that cannot be. For J\xc3\xb1ana is of the nature of\nIntelligence and \xc3\x82tman is of the the nature of Intelligence. Intelligence has\nnot the attribute of being Dharma. Here the thing Chit is not different from\nits quality (Chit). So \xc3\x82tman is always of the nature of J\xc3\xb1ana and happiness;\nIts nature is Truth; It is always Full, unattached and void of duality. This\n\xc3\x82tman again, united with Maya, composed of desires and Karmas, wants to\ncreate, due to the want of discrimination, the twenty-four tattvas, according\nto the previous Samskaras (tendencies), time and Karma. O Mountain! The re-\nawakening after Pralaya Su _s_ upti is not done with Buddhi (for then Buddhi\nis not at all manifested). So this creation is said to be effected without any\nBuddhi (proper intelligence). O Chief of the Immovables! The Tattva (Reality)\nthat I have spoken to you is most excellent and it is my Extraordinary Form\nmerely. In the Vedas it is known as Avyakrita (unmodified), Avyakta\n(unmanifested)\n\np. 709\n\nMaya S\'abala (divided into various parts) and so forth. In all tlkc S\'astras,\nit is stated to be the Cause of all causes, the Primeval Tattva and\nSachchidlinanda Vigraba. Where all the Karmas are solidified and where Ichcha\nS\'akti, (will), J\xc3\xb1ana S\'akti (intelligence) and Kriya S\'akti (action) all are\nmelted in one, that is called the Mantra Hrim, that is the first Tattva. From\nthis comes out \xc3\x82kasa, having the property of sound, thence Vayu (air) with\n"touch" property; then fire with form, then water having "Rasa" property; and\nlastly the earth having the quality "smell." The Pundits say that the "sound"\nis the only quality of \xc3\x82kasa; air has two qualities viz., sound and touch,\nfire has three qualities sound, touch, form; water has four qualities sound,\ntouch, form, taste; and the earth has five qualities sound, touch, form, taste\nand smell, Out of these five original elements, the allpervading, Sutra\n(string or thread) arose. This Sutratman (soul) is called the "Linga Deha,"\ncomprising within itself all the Pra _n_ as; this is the subtle body of the\nParamatman. And what is said in the previous lines as Avyakta or Unmainfested\nand in which the Seed of the World is involved and whence the Linga Deha has\nsprung, that is called the Causal body (Kara _n_ a body) of the Paramatman.\nThe five original elements (Apa\xc3\xb1chikrita called the five Tan Matras) being\ncreated, next by the Pa\xc3\xb1chikara _n_ a process, the gross elements are created.\nThe process is now being stated:--O Girija! Each of the five original elements\nis divided into two parts; one part of each of which is subdivided into four\nparts. This fourth part of each is united with the half of four other elements\ndifferent from it and thus each gross element is formed. By these five gross\nelements, the Cosmic (Vira _t_ ) body is formed and this is called the Gross\nBody of the God. J\xc3\xb1anendriyas (the organs of knowledge) arise from Sattva Gu\n_n_ as of each of these five elements. Again the Sattva Gu _n_ as of each of\nthe J\xc3\xb1anendriyas united become the Anta _h_ Kara _n_ ani. This Anta _h_ kara\n_n_ a is of four kinds, according as its functions vary. When it is engaged in\nforming Sankalpas, resolves, and Vikalpas (doubts) it is called "mind." When\nit is free from doubts and when it arrives at the decisive conclusion, it is\ncalled "Chitta"; and when it rests simply on itself in the shape of the\nfeeling "I", it is called Ahamkara. From the Rajo Gu _n_ a of each of the five\nelements arises Vak (speech), Pa _n_ i (hands) Pada (feet), Payu (Anus) and\nUpastha (organs of generation). Again their Rajo parts united give rise to the\nfive Pra _n_ as (Pra _n_ a, Apana, Samana, Udana and Vyana) the Pra _n_ a Vayu\nresides in the heart; Apana Vayu in the Arms; Samana Vayu resides in the\nNavel; Udana Vayu rasides in the Throat; and the Vyana Vayu resides, pervading\nall over the body. My subtle body (Linga Deha) arises from the union of the\nfive\n\np. 710\n\nJ\xc3\xb1anendriyas, the five Karmendriyas (organs of action), the five Pra _n_ as\nand the mind and Buddhi, these seventeen elements. And the Prakriti that\nresides there is divided into two parts; one is pure (Suddha Satbva) Maya and\nthe other is the impure Maya or Avidya united with the Gu _n_ as. By Maya is\nmeant She, who, without concealing Her refugees, protects them. When the\nSupreme Self is reflected on this S\'uddha Sattva, Maya, He is called \xc3\x8es\'vara.\nThis Saddha Maya does not conceal Brahma, its receptacle; therefore She knows\nthe All-pervading Brahma and She is omniscient, omnipotent, the Lady of all\nand confors favours and blessings on all. When the Supreme Self is reflected\non the Impure Maya or Avidya, He is called Jiva. This Avidya conceals Brahma,\nWhose nature is Happiness; therefore this Jiva is the source of all miseries.\nBoth \xc3\x8es\'vara and Jiva have, by the influence of Vidya and Avidya three bodies\nand three names. When the Jiva lives in his causal body, he is named Prajna;\nwhen he lives in subtle body he is known as Taijasa; while he has the gross\nbody, he is called Vis\'va. So when \xc3\x8es\'vara is in His causal body, he is\ndenominated \xc3\x8es\'a; when He is in His subtle body, he is known as Sutra; and\nwhen He is in His groqs body, He is known as Vira _t_.\n\nThe Jiva glories in having three (as above-mentioned) kinds of differentiated\nbodies and \xc3\x8es\'vara glories in having three (as above-mentioned) kinds of\ncosmic bodies. Thus \xc3\x8es\'vara is the Lord of all and though He feels Himself\nalways happy and satisfied, yet to favour the Jivas and to give them\nliberation (Mok _s_ a) He has created various sorts of worldly things for\ntheir Bhogas (enjoyments). This \xc3\x8es\'vara creates all the Universe, impelled by\nMy Brahma S\'akti. I am of the nature of Brahma; and \xc3\x8es\'vara in conceived in Me\nas a snake is imagined in a rope. Therefore \xc3\x8es\'vara has to remain dependent on\nMy S\'akti.\n\nHere ends the Thirty-second Chapter of the Seventh Book on Self-realization,\nspoken by the World Mother in the Mahapura _n_ am S\'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, of\n18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXXIII: The Goddess displays her Cosmic Form](dg03.htm)\n\n'
