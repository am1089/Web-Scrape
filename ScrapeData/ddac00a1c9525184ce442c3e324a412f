When he passes by a place where four ways meet, let him turn his right\nside towards it.\n\n27\\. And let him do the same in passing by the image of a deity;\n\n28\\. And in passing by well-known large trees.\n\n29\\. After having seen a fire, or a Brahma _n_ a (with his turban on), or a\npublic prostitute, or a jar filled (with water), or a looking-glass, or an\numbrella, or a flag, or a banner[1], or a Bel tree, or a lid (or platter), or\na palace built in the shape of a certain diagram (or in the form of a\nquadrangle without a western gate)[2];\n\n[29. 1 \'More precisely the term pataka signifies "a staff, by which a piece of\ncloth torn in the middle is fastened."\' (Nand.)--2 \'The particle _k_ a is\nadded at the end of this enumeration in order \'to include in it perfumes,\nlamps, and other objects mentioned in a Sm _ri_ ti.\' (Nand.)]\n\np. 201\n\n30\\.

(Also, if he has seen) one who has vomited, or one who has been purged,\nor one who has had his head shorn, or one who wears all his hair tied in one\nknot, or a dwarf;\n\n[30. \'The particle _k_ a, which is added at the end of this Sutra, refers to a\nking, his ministers, his domestic priest, &C., as indicated in a Sm _ri_ ti\npassage.\' (Nand.)\n\n31\\. Nand. infers from another Sm _ri_ ti passage that _k_ a here refers to a\ncrow and to a _S_ udra or workman with his tools.\n\n32\\. Nand. here refers _k_ a to shells and other objects mentioned in a Sm\n_ri_ ti.\n\n33\\. Nand. here refers _k_ a to a dead body and other objects enumerated in a\nSm _ri_ ti.\n\n34\\. The enumeration of auspicious objects in Sutras 29-33 is followed by an\nenumeration of inauspicious objects in Sutras 34-38. (Nand.)\n\n35\\. The particle _k_ a refers to enemies, outcasts, and others mentioned in a\nSm _ri_ ti. (Nand.)]\n\np. 202\n\n36\\.

Or (if he has seen) salt, or a eunuch, or (the spirituous liquor called)\n\xc3\x82sava, or an impotent man, or cotton cloth, or a rope, or an iron chain for\nthe feet, or a person with dishevelled hair.\n\n39\\. (If he sees), while about to begin a journey, a lute, or sandal-wood, or\nfresh pot-herbs, or a turban, or an Ornament, or an unmarried damsel, he must\npraise them.\n\n[36. 1 Nand. refers kashayin, \'wearing a dress dyed with Kashaya,\' to \'persons\nwho wear the marks of an order to which they do not belong.\' But this\ninterpretation is evidently wrong. Among the sects that wear a dress dyed with\nKashaya, Buddhists are the most prominent, but it must not be overlooked that\nthere are other important sects also, as e. g. the Svaminaraya _n_ is of the\npresent day, who wear such dresses.--2 The term malina, \'smeared,\' no doubt\nrefers to a _S_ aiva sect. Nand. interprets it by \'Kapalikas and the like;\'\nbut more probably the Pa _s_ upatas are meant.--3 The particle _k_ a further\nrefers to the humpbacked, deaf, and blind, to barren women, and to naked and\nhungry persons, as stated in a Sm _ri_ ti. (Nand,)\n\n37\\. 1 Nand. refers the particle _k_ a in this Sutra to hares, naked\nmendicants, snakes, iguanas, lizards, skins, and other inauspicious objects\nand persons enumerated in a Sm _ri_ ti.\n\n38\\. Nand. argues from a passage of Narada (not found in his Institutes), that\nthe particle _k_ a here refers to persons mounted upon an ass, camel, or\nbuffalo, and others.\n\n39\\. 1 Nand. mentions two explanations of this Sutra: 1. he must eulogise the\nabove objects or persons if he sees them; 2. he must gladden persons, who have\nthose objects or persons with them, with presents and the like.]\n\np. 203\n\n40\\. He must not (knowingly) step on (or step over, or stand on) the shade of\nthe image of a deity, of a (learned) Brahma _n_ a, of a spiritual teacher, of\na brown (bull or other animal), or of one by whom the initiatory ceremony at a\nSoma-sacrifice has been performed.\n\n41\\. Nor (must he step) on anything spat out or vomited, nor on blood, nor on\nfaeces or urine, nor on water used for ablutions.\n\n42\\. He must not step over a rope to which a calf (or a cow) is tied.\n\n43\\. He must not walk quickly in the rain.\n\n44\\. He must not cross a river without need;\n\n45\\. Nor without having previously offered an oblation of water to the gods\nand to the manes;\n\n46\\. Nor (swimming) with his arms;\n\n47\\. Nor in a leaky vessel.\n\n48\\. He must not stand on the bank (of a river).\n\n49\\. He must not gaze into a pool.\n\n50\\. He must not cross it (by swimming through it, or in any other way).\n\n51\\. Way must be made for an aged man, for one carrying a burden, for a king,\nfor a Snataka (of any of the three kinds[1]), for a woman, for a sick person,\nfor a bridegroom, and for one riding in a carriage. Among those, should they\nall meet, a king must be\n\n[41. According to Nand., the particle va, \'or,\' is added at the end of this\nSutra, in order to include an officiating priest and others mentioned by Ya\n_g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya I, 152.\n\n51\\. 1 The Snataka (see XXV III, 42, note) is of three kinds: 1. the\nVidyasnataka, who has studied the Vedas; 2. the Vratasnataka, who has\nperformed the Vratas or vowed observances of a student; 3. the Ubhayasnataka,\nwho has completed both the Vedas and the Vratas. (Nand.) See the G _ri_ hya-\nsutras.]\n\np. 204\n\nhonoured by the rest (excepting the Snataka); but the king himself must show\nhonour to a Snataka.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: LXIV.](sbe07066.htm)\n\n'
