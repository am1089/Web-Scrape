If it be objected that(Brahman is) not (denoted) on account of the metre\nbeing denoted; (we reply) not so, because thus (i.e. by means of the metre)\nthe direction of the mind (on Brahman) is declared; for thus it is seen (in\nother passages also).\n\nWe now address ourselves to the refutation of the assertion (made in the\npurvapaksha of the preceding Sutra) that in the previous passage also Brahman\nis not referred to, because in the sentence, 'Gayatri is everything whatsoever\nhere exists,' the metre called Gayatri is spoken of.--How (we ask the\npurvapakshin) can it be maintained that, on account of the metre being spoken\nof, Brahman is not denoted, while yet the mantra 'such is the greatness of\nit,' &c., clearly sets forth Brahman with its four quarters?--You are mistaken\n(the purvapakshin replies). The sentence, 'Gayatri is everything,' starts the\ndiscussion of Gayatri. The same Gayatri is thereupon described under the\nvarious forms of all beings, earth, body, heart, speech, breath; to which\nthere refers also the verse, 'that Gayatri\n\np. 94\n\nhas four feet and is sixfold.' After that we meet with the mantra, 'Such is\nthe greatness of it.' &c. How then, we ask, should this mantra, which\nevidently is quoted with reference to the Gayatri (metre) as described in the\npreceding clauses, all at once denote Brahman with its four quarters? Since\ntherefore the metre Gayatri is the subject-matter of the entire chapter, the\nterm 'Brahman' which occurs in a subsequent passage ('the Brahman which has\nthus been described') must also denote the metre. This is analogous to a\nprevious passage ( _Kh_ , Up. III, 11, 3, 'He who thus knows this Brahma-\nupanishad'), where the word Brahma-upanishad is explained to mean Veda-\nupanishad. As therefore the preceding passage refers (not to Brahman, but) to\nthe Gayatri metre, Brahman does not constitute the topic of the entire\nsection.\n\nThis argumentation, we reply, proves nothing against our position. 'Because\nthus direction of the mind is declared,' i. e. because the Brahma _n_ a\npassage, 'Gayatri indeed is all this,' intimates that by means of the metre\nGayatri the mind is to be directed on Brahman which is connected with that\nmetre. Of the metre Gayatri, which is nothing but a certain special\ncombination of syllables, it could not possibly be said that it is the Self of\neverything. We therefore have to understand the passage as declaring that\nBrahman, which, as the cause of the world, is connected with that product also\nwhose name is Gayatri, is 'all this;' in accordance with that other passage\nwhich directly says, 'All this indeed is Brahman' (Kh. Up. III, 14, 1). That\nthe effect is in reality not different from the cause, we shall prove later\non, under Sutra II, 1, 14. Devout meditation on Brahman under the form of\ncertain effects (of Brahman) is seen to be mentioned in other passages also,\nso, for instance, Ait. \xc3\x82r. III, 2, 3, 12, 'For the Bahv _rik_ as consider him\nin the great hymn, the Adhvaryus in the sacrificial fire, the _Kh_ andogas in\nthe Mahavrata ceremony.' Although, therefore, the previous passage speaks of\nthe metre, Brahman is what is meant, and the same Brahman is again referred to\nin the passage about the light, whose purport it is to enjoin another form of\ndevout meditation.\n\np. 95\n\nAnother commentator 1 is of opinion that the term Gayatri (does not denote\nBrahman in so far as viewed under the form of Gayatri, but) directly denotes\nBrahman, on account of the equality of number; for just as the Gayatri metre\nhas four feet consisting of six syllables each, so Brahman also has four feet,\n(i. e. quarters.) Similarly we see that in other passages also the names of\nmetres are used to denote other things which resemble those metres in certain\nnumerical relations; cp. for instance, _Kh_. Up. IV, 3, 8, where it is said at\nfirst, 'Now these five and the other five make ten and that is the K _ri_ ta,'\nand after that 'these are again the Vira _g_ which eats the food.' If we adopt\nthis interpretation, Brahman only is spoken of, and the metre is not referred\nto at all. In any case Brahman is the subject with which the previous passage\nis concerned.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[95:1](sbe34031.htm#fr_131) The v _ri_ ttikara according to Go. \xc3\x82n. in his _t_\nika on the bhashya to the next Sutra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 1, 26](sbe34032.htm)\n\n"
