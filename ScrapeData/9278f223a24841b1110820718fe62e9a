Dewee,\nseated with her husband in a chariot, is fascinated; hearing the notes with\nthe greatest delight. The bracelets and rings on his hand steal away all\nsensation from the agitated mind and body." Then one of the women of Bruj\nsaid, "The clouds were so overcome, that they ceased to thunder. Huri sings\njoyfully standing in one position, and makes his eye-brow, feet and cheek keep\ntime. The doe and deer are fascinated with the notes. The Jumna is turned from\nits course; and the cows gather together. The charmed clouds cast a shadow,\nand form a canopy over Krishnu\'s head. At one time Krishnu retired to arbours\nwith thick foliage; at another, all sat with him under a fig tree. The cows\nroamed about behind him; and when they were collected, he took them to water.\nIn the evening Huri returned, and the cows lowed on hearing the sound of the\nflute."\n\np. 121\n\nHaving proceeded thus far in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the\nRaja Pureechit,--O great king! in this manner the cowherdesses constantly\ncelebrated the great fame of Krishnu during the whole day: and going forth in\nthe evening to meet Shree Krishnu Chund, the root of joy, derived the greatest\nenjoyment from his society. And at the same time the Ranee Jusodha, having\nwiped the dust-covered face of her son in a most affectionate manner, was\ndelighted to embrace him.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXXVII](psa38.htm)\n\n'
