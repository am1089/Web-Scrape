On the road beginning with light (the departed soul proceeds), on account\nof that being widely known.\n\nIt has been explained that up to the beginning of the way, the departure is\nthe same. About the way itself, however, different texts make different\ndeclarations. One passage describes it as constituted by the junction of the\nveins and rays, 'Then he mounts upwards by just those rays' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII,\n6, 5), Another passage describes it as beginning with light, 'They go to the\nlight, from light to day' ( _Kh_. Up. V, 10, 1). Another way is described,\nKau. Up. I, 3, 'Having reached the path of the gods, he comes to the world of\nAgni.' Another, B _ri_. Up. V, 10, 1, 'When the person goes away from this\nworld, he comes to the wind.' Another again. Mu. Up. I, 2, 11, 'Free from\npassions they depart through the gate of the sun.' A doubt here arises whether\nthese ways are different from each other, or whether there is only one road of\nwhich the different texts mention different particulars.--The purvapakshin\nembraces the former alternative, for the reason that those roads are referred\nto in different chapters and form parts of different meditations. If,\nmoreover, we regarded the statements about light and so on, the emphatical\nassertion 1 made in the first of the passages quoted above would be\ncontradicted; and the statement about the quickness of mounting, 'As quickly\nas he sends off the mind he goes to the sun,' would also be interfered with.\nWe therefore conclude that the roads described are different roads. To this we\nreply, 'On the road beginning with light;'\n\np. 383\n\ni.e. we maintain that every one who desires to reach Brahman moves on the road\nbeginning with light.--Why so?--'On account of its being widely known.' That\nroad is known to all who possess knowledge. Thus the chapter of the vidya of\nthe five fires ('And those also who in the forest meditate on the True as\nfaith,' &c., B _ri_. Up. VI, 2, 15) expressly states that the road beginning\nwith the light belongs to those also who practise other meditations.--That\nroad, an objection is raised, may present itself to the mind in the case of\nthose meditations which do not mention any road of their own; but why should\nit be accepted for such meditations as mention different roads of their own?--\nThis objection would be valid, we reply, if the various roads mentioned were\nentirely different; but as a matter of fact there is only one road leading to\nthe world of Brahman and possessing different attributes; and this road is\ndesignated in one place by one attribute and in another place by another\nattribute. For this relation of attributes and what possesses attributes is\nestablished by the circumstance that we recognise, in all the passages quoted,\nsome part of the road 1. And if the chapters which mention the roads are\ndifferent, we, as long as the meditation is one, have to combine the different\nattributes of the road (mentioned separately in the different chapters), in\nthe same way as (in general) the different particulars of one meditation\n(which are stated in different chapters) have to be combined. And even if the\nmeditations (in which the particulars of the road are mentioned) are\ndifferent, the road must be viewed as one and the same, because we recognise\neverywhere some part of the road and because the goal is everywhere the same.\nFor all the following passages declare one and the same result, viz. the\nobtainment of the world of Brahman: 'In these worlds of Brahman they dwell for\never and ever' (B _ri_. Up. VI, 2, 15); 'There he dwells eternal years' (B\n_ri_. Up. V, 10, 1);\n\np. 384\n\n[paragraph continues] 'Whatever victory, whatever greatness belongs to\nBrahman, that victory he gives, that greatness he reaches' (Kau. Up. I, 2);\n'Those who find the world of Brahman by Brahma _k_ arya' (Kh. Up. VIII, 4, 3).\n--To the remark that the emphatical assertion (made in the passage, 'Just by\nthose rays,' &c.) would be contradicted by our admitting light and so on as\nstages of the road, we reply that no such difficulty exists, because that\npassage aims only at establishing the rays (as part of the road). For the one\nword 'just' cannot at the same time establish the rays and discard light and\nso on. The passage therefore must be understood as only emphasising the\nconnexion with the rays.--Nor does the regard paid by us to the statements\nabout light and so on being stages of the way contradict what one passage says\nabout speed; for that passage means to say that one goes (to the world of\nBrahman) more quickly than anywhere else, so that its sense is, 'In the\ntwinkling of an eye one goes there 1.'--Moreover the passage, 'On neither of\nthese two ways' (Kh. Up. V, 10, 8)--in teaching that there is a third inferior\nroad for those who have missed the other two roads--shows that besides the\nroad of the fathers there is only one further road, viz. the road of the gods,\nof which light and so on are stages. The text about light and so on mentioning\na greater number of stages while other texts mention a smaller number, it\nstands to reason that the less numerous should be explained in conformity,\nwith the more numerous. For this reason also the Sutra says, 'On the road\nbeginning with light, on account of its being widely known.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[382:1](sbe38302.htm#fr_223) The emphasis lies in the word 'eva,' i.e. 'just'\nor 'only,' which seems to exclude any stages of the way but those rays.\n\n[383:1](sbe38302.htm#fr_224) Each passage mentions at least one of the stages\nof the road leading to the world of Brahman, and we thus conclude that the\nsame road--of which the stations are the attributes--is meant everywhere.\n\n[384:1](sbe38302.htm#fr_225) Read in the text--tvaravakana _m_ tv ar _k_\niradyapekshayam api gantavyantarapekshaya kshaipryartha\xc2\xb0.--\xc3\x82nandagiri comments\n--tvareti, ar _k_ iradimargasyaikye\xe0\xa4\xbdpi kuta _s_ kid anyato gantavyad\nanenopayena satyaloka _m_ _g_ a _t_ iti ga _k_ _kh_ antiti\ngantavyabhedapekshaya va _k_ ana _m_ yuktam ity artha _h_.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 3, 2](sbe38303.htm)\n\n"
