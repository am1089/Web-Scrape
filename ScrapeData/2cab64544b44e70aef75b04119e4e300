A rushing tide,  \nTen leagues they spread from side to side,  \nAnd on to storm thy citv press,  \nFierce rovers of the wilderness.  \nRich in each princely power and grace,  \nThe pride of Das'aratha's race,  \nRama and Lakshman lead their bands,  \nAnd halt them on the ocean sands.  \nO Monarch, rise, this peril meet;  \nRisk not the danger of defeat.  \n\np. 442  \n\nFirst let each wiser art be tried;  \nBribe them, or win them, or divide.'  \nSuch was the counsel of the spy:  \nAnd Ravan called to S'uka: 'Fly,  \nSugriva lord of Vanars seek,  \nAnd thus my kingly message speak:  \n'Great power and might and fame are thine.  \nBrave scion of a royal line,  \nKing Riksharajuas' son, in thee  \nA brother and a friend I see.  \nHow wrouged by me canst thou complain?  \nWhat profit here pretend to gain?  \nIf from the wood the wife I stole  \nOf Rama of the prudent soul,  \nWhat cause hast thou to mourn the theft?  \nThou art not injured or bereft.  \nReturn, O King, thy steps retrace  \nAnd seek thy mountain dwelling-place.  \nNo, never may thy hosts within  \nMy Lanka's walls a footing win.  \nA mighty town whose strength defies  \nThe gathered armies of the skies.'  \n   He ceased: obedient S'uka heard;  \nWith wings and plumage of a bird  \nHe rose in eager speed and through  \nThe air upon his errand flew.  \nBorne o'er the sea with rapid wing  \nHe stood above the Vanar king,  \nAnd spoke aloud, sublime in air.  \nThu message he was charged so bear.  \nThe Vanar heard the words he spoke,  \nAnd quick redoubling stroke on stroke  \nOn head and pinions hemmed him round  \nAnd bore him struggling to the grouud.  \nThe Rakshas wounded and distressed  \nThese words to Raghu's son addressed:  \n   'Quick, quick! This Vanar host * restrain,  \nFor heralds never must be slain.  \nTo him alone, a wretch untrue,  \nThe punishment of death is due  \nWho leaves his master's speech unsaid  \nAnd speaks another word * instead'  \nMoved by the suppliant speech and praver  \nUp sprang the prince and cried, forbear.  \nSaved from his wild assailant's blows  \nAgain the Rakshas herald rose  \nAnd borne on light wings to the sky  \nAddressed Sugriva from on high:  \n'O Vanar Monarch, chief endued  \nWith power and wonderous fortitude.  \nWhat answer is my king the fear  \nAnd scourge of weeping worlds, to hear?'  \n'Go tell thy lord,' Sugriva cried.  \n'Thou, Rama's foe, art thus defied.  \nHis arm the guilty Bali slew;  \nThus, tyrant, shalt thee perish too,  \nThy sons, thy friends, proud King and all  \nThy kith and kin with thee shall fall;  \nAnd emptied of the giant's brood,  \nBurnt * Lanka be a solitude.  \n\nFly to the Sun-God's pathway, go  \nAnd hide thee deep in hell below:  \nIn vain from Rama shalt thou flee  \nThough heavenly warriors fight for thee.  \nThine arm subdued, securely bold,  \nThe Vulture-king infirm and old:  \nBut will thy puny strength avail  \nWhen Raghu's wrathful sons assail?  \nA captive in thy palace lies  \nThe lady of the lotus eyes:  \nThou knowest not how fierce and strong  \nIs he whom thou hast dared to wrong.  \nThe best of Raghu's lineage, he  \nWhose conquering hand shall punish thee.'  \n   He ceased: and Augad raised a cry;  \n'This is no herald but a spy.  \nAbove thee from his airy post  \nHis rapid eye surveyed our host,  \nWhere with advantage he might scan  \nOur gathered strength from rear to van,  \nBind him. Vanars, bind the spy,  \nNor let him back to Lanka fly.'  \n   They hurled the Rakshas to the ground,  \nThiey grasped his neck, his pinions bound,  \nAnd firmly held bear while * in vain  \nHis voice was lifted to complain.  \nBut Rama's heart inclined to spare,  \nHe listened to his plaint and prayer,  \nAnd cried aloud: 'O Vanars, cease;  \nThe captive from his bonds release.'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[441:1b](ry418.htm#fr_942) The story is told in Book I.
