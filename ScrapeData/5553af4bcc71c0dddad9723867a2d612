In the case of a Brahma _n_ a. no corporal punishment must be inflicted.\n\n3\\. A Brahma _n_ a must be banished from his own country, his body having been\nbranded.\n\n[1. The crimes by the commission of which a man becomes a Mahapatakin, 'mortal\nsinner,' will be enumerated below, XXXV.\n\n2\\. The use of the particle _k_ a implies, according, to Nand. and a passage\nof Yama quoted by him, that, besides brawling him, the criminal should be\nshorn, his deed publicly proclaimed, and himself mounted upon an ass and led\nabout the town.]\n\np. 26\n\n4\\. For murdering another Brahma _n_ a, let (the figure of) a headless corpse\nbe impressed on his forehead;\n\n5\\. For drinking spirits, the flag of a seller of spirituous liquor;\n\n6\\. For stealing (gold), a dog's foot,\n\n7\\. For incest, (the mark of) a female part.\n\n8\\. If he has committed any other capital crime, he shall be banished, taking\nwith him all his property, and unhurt.\n\n9\\. Let the king put to death those who forge royal edicts;\n\n10\\. And those who forge (private) documents;\n\n11\\. Likewise poisoners, incendiaries, robbers, and killers of women,\nchildren, or men;\n\n12\\. And such as steal more than ten Kumbhas of grain,\n\n13\\. Or more than a hundred Mashas of such things as are usually sold by\nweight (such as gold and silver);\n\n14\\. Such also as aspire to sovereignty, though being of low birth;\n\n15\\. Breakers of dikes;\n\n[10. The use of the particle _k_ a indicates that this rule includes those who\ncorrupt the king's ministers, as stated by Manu, IX, 232. (Nand.)\n\n11\\. Nand. infers from the use of the particle ka, and from a passage of\nKatyayana, that false witnesses are also intended here.\n\n12\\. Nand. here refers _k_ a to women who have committed a capital offence, as\nmentioned by Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya,(II, 278). A Kumbha is a measure of grain equal\nto twenty Dro _n_ as, or a little more than three bushels and three gallons.\nNand. mentions, as the opinion of some, that 1 Kumbha = 2 Dro _n_ as. For\nother computations of the amount of a Kumbha, see Colebrooke's Essays, I, 533\nseq.\n\n13\\. Regarding the value of a Masha, see IV, 7, I 1.\n\n15\\. Nand. infers from the use of the particle _k_ a and from a {footnote p.\n27} passage of Manu (IX, 280), that robbers who forcibly enter the kings\ntreasury, or the arsenal, or a temple, are likewise intended here.]\n\np. 27\n\n16\\. And such as give shelter and food to robbers,\n\n17\\. Unless the king be unable (to protect his subjects against robbers); the\nduty which\n\n18\\. And a woman who violates she owes to her lord, the latter being unable to\nrestrain her.\n\n19\\. With whatever limb an inferior insults or hurts his superior in caste, of\nthat limb the king shall cause him to be deprived.\n\n20\\. If he places himself on the same seat with his superior, he shall be\nbanished with a mark on his buttocks. he shall lose both lips;\n\n21\\. If he spits on him,\n\n22\\. If he breaks wind against him, his hindparts;\n\n23\\. If he uses abusive language, his tongue.\n\n24\\. If a (low-born) man through pride give instruction (to a member of the\nhighest caste) concerning his duty, let the king order hot oil to be dropped\ninto his mouth.\n\n25\\. If a (low-born man) mentions the name or caste of a superior revilingly,\nan iron pin, ten inches long, shall be thrust into his mouth (red hot).\n\n26\\. He who falsely denies the sacred knowledge, the country, or the caste (of\nsuch), or who says\n\n[17. In the case to which this Sutra refers, the villagers may satisfy the\ndemands of the robbers with impunity, as they are obliged to do so out of\nregard for their own safety. (Nand.)\n\n20\\. The particle _k_ a, indicates here that if he urinates against a superior\nhis organ shall be cut off. (Nand.) See M. VIII, 282.\n\n26\\. This Sutra has been rendered in accordance with Kulluka's gloss on M.\nVIII, 273, Nand.'s interpretation of it being palpably wrong.]\n\np. 28\n\nthat his religious duties have not been fulfilled by (or that the initiatory\nand other sacramental rites have not been performed for) him, shall be fined\ntwo hundred Pa _n_ as.\n\n27\\. If a man is blind with one eye, or lame, or defective in any similar way,\nand another calls him so, he shall be fined two Karshapa _n_ as, though he\nspeaks the truth.\n\n28\\. He shall be fined a hundred Karshapa _n_ as for defaming a Guru.\n\n29\\. He shall pay the highest amercement for imputing to another (a great\ncrime) entailing loss of caste;\n\n30\\. The second amercement for (imputing to another) a minor offence (such as\nthe slaughter of a cow);\n\n31\\. The same for reviling a Brahma _n_ a versed in the three Vedas, or an old\nman, or a (whole) caste or corporation (of judges or others);\n\n32\\. For reviling a village or district, the lowest amercement;\n\n33\\. For using insulting language (such as 'I shall visit your sister,' or 'I\nshall visit your daughter'), a hundred Karshapa _n_ as;\n\n34\\. For insulting a man by using bad language regarding his mother (such as\n'I shall visit your mother' or the like speeches), the highest amercement.\n\n35\\. For abusing a man of his own caste, he shall be fined twelve Pa _n_ as.\n\n36\\. For abusing a man of a lower caste, he shall be fined six (Pa _n_ as).\n\n[32. Nand. infers from the use of the particle _k_ a that 'a family' is also\nintended here.]\n\np. 29\n\n37\\. For insulting a member of the highest caste or of his own caste (he\nhaving been insulted by him) at the same time, the same fine is ordained;\n\n38\\. Or (if he only returns his insult, a fine amounting to) three Karshapa\n_n_ as.\n\n39\\. The same (punishment is ordained) if he calls him bad names.\n\n40\\. An adulterer shall be made to pay the highest amercement if he has had\nconnection with a woman of his own caste;\n\n41\\. For adultery with women of a lower caste, the second amercement;\n\n42\\.

For a bestial crime committed with cattle (other than cows) he shall be\nfined a hundred Karshapa _n_ as.\n\n45\\. (The same fine is ordained) for giving a (blemished) damsel in marriage,\nwithout indicating her blemish (whether the bride be sick, or no longer a\nmaid, or otherwise faulty);\n\n46\\. And he shall have to support her.\n\n47\\. He who says of an unblemished damsel, that she has a blemish (shall pay)\nthe highest amercement.\n\n48\\. For killing an elephant, or a horse, or a camel, or a cow, (the criminal)\nshall have one hand, or one foot, lopped off\n\n[43. The lowest castes (antya _h_ ), according to A _n_ giras, are the\nfollowing seven, _K_ a _nd_ alas, Svapa _k_ as, Kshatt _ri_ s, Sutas,\nVaidehakas, Magadhas, and \xc3\x82yogavas.]\n\np. 30\n\n49\\.

And all such offenders (shall make good) to the owners (of the trees or\nplants cut down by them) the revenue which they yield.\n\n60\\. If any man raises his hand (against his equal in caste, with intent to\nstrike him, he shall pay) ten Karshapa _n_ as;\n\n61\\. If he raises his foot, twenty;\n\n62\\. If he raises a piece of wood, the first amercement;\n\n63\\. If he raises a stone, the second amercement;\n\n64\\. If he raises a weapon, the highest amercement.\n\n65\\.

He who does not deliver to the purchaser a commodity (sold), after its\nprice has been paid to him, shall be compelled to deliver it to him with\ninterest;\n\n[117. Nand. considers the particle _k_ a to imply that the exchange of sealed\ngoods for others shall be punished in the same way.

And he shall pay a hundred Pa _n_ as to the king.\n\np. 38\n\n155\\. What has been destroyed through his want of care, (he must make good) to\nthe owner;\n\n156\\. Unless the damage have been caused by an accident.\n\n157\\. If an employer dismisses a workman (whom he has hired) before the\nexpiration of the term, he shall pay him his entire wages;\n\n158\\. And (he shall pay) a hundred Pa _n_ as to the king;\n\n159\\. Unless the workman have been at fault.\n\n160\\. He who, having promised his daughter to one suitor, gives her in\nmarriage to another, shall be punished as a thief;\n\n161\\. Unless the (first) suitor have a blemish.\n\n162\\. The same (punishment is ordained for a suitor) who abandons a faultless\ngirl;\n\n163\\. (And for a husband who forsakes) a (blameless) wife.\n\n164\\. He who buys unawares in open market the property of another man (from\none not authorised to sell it) is not to blame;\n\n165\\. (But) the owner shall recover his property.\n\n166\\. If he has bought it in secret and under its price, the purchaser and the\nvendor shall be punished as thieves.\n\n167\\. He who embezzles goods belonging to a corporation (of Brahma _n_ as, and\nwhich have been sent to them by the king or by private persons), shall be\nbanished.\n\n168\\. He who violates their established. rule (shall) also (be banished).\n\n169\\. He who retains a deposit shall restore the commodity deposited to the\nowner, with interest.\n\n170\\.

He who has mortgaged more than a bull's hide of land to one creditor,\nand without having redeemed it mortgages it to another, shall be corporally\npunished (by whipping or imprisonment).\n\n[171. According to Nand., the particle _k_ a indicates that those who state\nthe nature or amount of a deposit wrongly ate also intended here.\n\n173\\. Thus according to Nand., who says expressly that the causative form\ncannot here mean causing to eat, because the punishment for the latter offence\nhas been mentioned in Sutra 98.]\n\np. 40\n\n182\\. If the quantity be less, he shall pay a fine of sixteen Suvar _n_ as.\n\n183\\. That land, whether little or much, on the produce of which one man can\nsubsist for a year, is called the quantity of a bull's hide.\n\n184\\. If a dispute should arise between two (creditors) concerning (a field or\nother immovable property) which has been mortgaged to both at the same time,\nthat mortgagee shall enjoy its produce who holds it in his possession, without\nhaving obtained it by force.\n\n185\\. What has been possessed in order and with a legitimate title (such as\npurchase, donation, and the like), the possessor may keep; it can never be\ntaken from him.\n\n186\\. Where (land or other) property has been held in legitimate possession by\nthe father (or grandfather), the son's right to it, after his death, cannot be\ncontested; for it has become his own by force of possession.\n\n187\\. If possession has been held of an estate by three (successive)\ngenerations in due course, the fourth in descent shall keep it as his\nproperty, even without a written title.\n\n188\\.

Any one may unhesitatingly slay a man who attacks him with intent to\nmurder him, whether his spiritual teacher, young or old, or a Brahma _n_ a,\n\np. 41\n\nor even (a Brahma _n_ a) versed in many branches of sacred knowledge.\n\n190\\. By killing an assassin who attempts to kill, Whether in public or in\nprivate, no crime is committed by the slayer: fury recoils upon fury.\n\n191\\. Assassins should be known to be of seven kinds: such as try to kill with\nthe sword, or with poison, or with fire, such as raise their hand in order to\npronounce a curse, such as recite a deadly incantation from the Atharva-veda,\nsuch as raise a false accusation which reaches the ears of the king,\n\n192\\. And such as have illicit intercourse with another man's wife. The same\ndesignation is given to other (evil-doers) who deprive others of their worldly\nfame or of their wealth, or who destroy religious merit (by ruining pools, or\nother such acts), or property (such as houses or fields).\n\n193\\. Thus I have declared to thee fully, O Earth, the criminal laws,\nenumerating at full length the punishments ordained for all sorts of offences.\n\n194\\. Let the king dictate due punishments for other offences also, after\nhaving ascertained the class and the age (of the criminal) and the amount (of\nthe damage done or sum claimed), and after having consulted the Brahma _n_ as\n(his advisers).\n\n195\\. That detestable judge who dismisses without punishment such as deserve\nit, and punishes such as deserve it not, shall incur twice as heavy a penalty\nas the criminal himself.\n\n196\\. A king in whose dominion there exists neither thief, nor adulterer, nor\ncalumniator, nor robber, nor murderer, attains the World of Indra.\n\np. 42\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI.](sbe07008.htm)\n\n"
