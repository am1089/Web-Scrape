(Should it be said that the souls are not enveloped by water) on account\nof this not being stated by scripture, we refute the objection on the ground\nof those who perform ish _t_ is, &c., being understood.\n\nWell, let it be granted that, on account of question and answer, water,\npassing through the forms of _s_ raddha, &c., may in the fifth oblation obtain\nthe shape of man. But still we cannot allow that the souls when moving from\none body into another are enveloped by water. For this is not directly stated\nby scripture, there being in the whole passage no word referring to the souls,\nwhile there are words referring to water. Hence the assertion that the soul\ngoes enveloped by water is unfounded.--This objection is invalid, we reply,\n'on account of those who perform ish _t_ is, &c., being understood.' For in\nthe passage beginning 'But they who living in a village practise sacrifices,\nworks of public utility and alms, they go to the smoke' (V, 3, 10), it is said\nthat those who perform ish _t_ is reach, on the road of the fathers leading\nthrough smoke. &c.. the moon, 'From ether they go to the moon; that is Soma,\nthe king.' Now these same persons are meant in the passage about the five\nfires also, as we conclude from the equality of scriptural statement in the\npassage, 'In that fire the devas offer\n\np. 109\n\n[paragraph continues] _s_ raddha. From that oblation rises Soma the king 1.'\nTo those 2 (persons who have performed ish _t_ is, &c.) water is supplied in\nthe shape of the materials employed to perform the agnihotra dar _s_ apur _n_\namasa and other sacrifices, viz. sour milk, milk, &c., which substances, as\nconsisting mostly of water, may directly be considered as water. Of these,\nwhen offered in the ahavaniya, the subtle parts assume the form of an apurva\nresulting from the oblation 3, and attach themselves to the performer of the\nsacrifice. Then (when the sacrificer dies) the priests offer his body, with\nthe funeral ceremonies 4, into the crematory fire, with the mantra, '(may) he\n(go) to the heavenly world, svaha.' Then the water forming the oblation--which\nhas connected with deeds resulting from faith 5\\--having assumed the form of\nan apurva envelops the souls of those who had performed the sacrifices, and\nleads them up to the heavenly world to receive their reward.--In accordance\nwith the preceding interpretation scripture says in the agnihotra chapter also\n--in the complementary passage constituting the reply to the six questions--\nthat the two agnihotra-obligations go up to the other world in order to\noriginate the fruit (of the work of the sacrificer), 'Those two oblations when\noffered go up, &c.' ( _S_ at. Br. XI, 6, 2, 6).--Hence we conclude that the\n\np. 110\n\nsouls, when going to the enjoyment of the fruits of their works, are enveloped\nby the water of which the oblations consist 1.\n\nBut how can it be maintained that those who perform sacrifices, &c., go to the\nenjoyment of the fruit of their works, considering that scripture declares\nthem when having reached the moon--by the path leading through smoke, &c.--to\nbecome food, 'That is Soma the king; that is the food of the gods; the gods do\neat it' ( _Kh_. Up. V, 10, 4); and the corresponding passage, 'Having reached\nthe moon they become food, and then the Devas feed on them there as\nsacrificers feed on Soma as it increases and decreases' (B _ri_. Up. VI, 2,\n16)? If, in accordance with these passages, they are eaten by the gods as by\ntigers, &c., it is not possible that they should enjoy the fruit of their\ndeeds.--To this the following Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[109:1](sbe38082.htm#fr_74) Both passages speak of something reaching, i.e.\nbecoming the moon. Now, as that something is, in the passage about the road of\nthe fathers, the _g_ ivas of those who have performed ish _t_ is, &c., we\nconclude that by the _s_ raddha also, from which in the other passage the moon\nis said to rise, those _g_ ivas are meant, or, properly speaking, the subtle\nbody of water which envelops those _g_ ivas.--Dhumadivakye pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_\nagnivakye _k_ a somara _g_ atvaprapti _s_ rava _n_ avi _s_ eshad ish _t_\nadikari _n_ a _h_ _s_ raddha _s_ abditadbhir vesh _th_ ita dyuloka _m_ yantiti\nbhatity artha _h_. \xc3\x82n. Gi.\n\n[109:2](sbe38082.htm#fr_75) An. Gi. introduces this clause by: nanu mahad iha\n_s_ rutyor vailaksha _n_ ya _m_ , _s_ raddha _s_ abditanam apa _m_ kva _k_ id\ndyuloke homa _h_ sruta _h_ kva _k_ id ish _t_ adikari _n_ am dhumadikrame _n_\naka _s_ apraptir na _k_ a tesham apa _h_ santi yena tadvesh _th_ itana _m_\ngatis tatraha tesha _m_ _k_ eti.\n\n[109:3](sbe38082.htm#fr_76) I read, with a MS. of An. Gi., ahutyapurvarupa\n_h_.\n\n[109:4](sbe38082.htm#fr_77) The so-called antyesh _t_ i.\n\n[109:5](sbe38082.htm#fr_78) And is on that account properly called _s_ raddha.\n\n[110:1](sbe38082.htm#fr_79) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara's attempts to render plausible the\ninterpretation of _s_ raddha by 'water,' and to base thereon the doctrine of\nthe souls when going to a new body being enveloped by a subtle involucrum of\nwater (and the other elements contained therein) are, of course, altogether\nartificial. I do not, however, see that he can be taxed with inconsistency (as\nhe is by Deussen, p. 408). Sraddha is to him in the first place the gross\nwater which constitutes the chief material employed in the sacrifices; in the\nsecond place the apurva which results from the sacrifice, and which is\nimagined to consist of the subtle parts of the water whose gross parts have\nbeen consumed by the sacrificial fire. These subtle parts attach themselves to\nthe soul, accompany it as an involucrum when it goes to another world, and\nform the base of any new body which the soul may have to assume in accordance\nwith its previous deeds.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 1, 7](sbe38083.htm)\n\n"
