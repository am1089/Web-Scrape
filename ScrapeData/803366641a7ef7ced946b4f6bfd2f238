'My lord, thy son is slain.  \nBy Lakshmau's hand, before these eyes,  \nThe warrior fell no more to rise.  \nNo time is this for vain regret:  \nThy hero son a hero met;  \nAnd he whose might in battle pressed  \nLord Indra and the Gods confessed,  \nWhose power was stranger to defeat,  \nHas gained in heaven a blissful seat.  \n\nThe monarch heard the mournful tale:  \nHis heart was faint, his cheek was pale;  \nHis fleeting sense at length regained,  \nIn trembling tones he thus complained:  \n'Ah me, my son, my pride: the boast  \nAnd glory of the giant host.  \nCould Lakshman's puny might defeat  \nThe foe whom Indra feared to meet?  \nCould not thy deadly arrows split  \nProud Mandar's peaks, O Indrajit,  \n\nAnd the Destroyer's self destroy?  \nAnd wast thou conquered by a boy?  \nI will not weep: thy noble deed  \nHas blessed thee with immortal meed  \nGained by each hero in the skies  \nWho fighting for his sovereign dies.  \nNow, fearless of all meaner foes.  \nThe guardian Gods  1b will taste repose:  \nBut earth to me, with hill and plain,  \nIn* desolate, for thou art slain.  \nAh, whither hast thou fled, and left  \nThy mother, Lanka, me bereft;  \nLeft pride and state and wives behind,  \nAnd lordship over all thy kind?  \nI fondly hoped thy hand should pay  \nDue honours on my dying day:  \nAnd couldst thou, O beloved, flee  \nAnd leave thy funeral rites to me?  \nLife has no comfort left me, none,  \nO Indrajit my son, my son.'  \n\nThus wailed he broken by his woes:  \nBut swift the thought of vengeance rose.  \nIn awful wrath his teeth he gnashed,  \nAnd from his eyes red lightning flashed.  \nHot from his mouth came fire and smoke,  \nAs thus the king in fury spoke:  \n\n'Through many a thousand years of yore  \nThe penance and the pain I bore,  \nAnd by fierce torment well sustained  \nThe highest grace of Brahma, gained,  \nHis plighted word my life assured,  \nFrom Gods of heaven and fiends secured.  \nHe armed my limbs with burnished mail  \nWhose lustre turns the sunbeams pale,  \nIn battle proof gainst heavenly bands  \nWith thunder in their threatening hands.  \nArmed in this mail myself will go  \nWith Brahma's gift my deadly bow,  \nAnd, cleaving through the foes my way,  \nThe slayers of my son will slay.'  \n\nThen, by his grief to frenzy wrought,  \nThe captive in the grove he sought.  \nSwift through the shady path he sped:  \nEarth trembled at his furious tread.  \nFierce were his eyes: his monstrous hand  \nHeld drawn for death his glittering brand.  \n\np. 488  \n\nThere weeping stood the Maithil dame:  \nShe shuddered as the giant came.  \nNear drew the rover of the night  \nAnd raised his sword in act to smite;  \nBut, by his nobler heart impelled,  \nOne Rakshas lord his arm withheld:  \n'Wilt thou, great Monarch,' thus he cried,  \n'Wilt thou, to heavenly Gods allied,  \nBlot for all time thy glorious fame,  \nThe slayer of a gentle dame?  \nWhat! shall a woman's blood be spilt  \nTo stain thee with eternal guilt,  \nThee deep in all the Veda's lore?  \nFar be the thought for evermore.  \nAh look, and let her lovely face  \nThis fury from thy bosom chase.'  \n\nHe ceased: the prudent counsel pleased  \nThe monarch, and his wrath appeased;  \nThen to his council hall in haste  \nThe giant lord his steps retraced.

When they fall Ravan sends\nforth Makaraksha or Crocodile-Eye, the son of Khara who was slain by Rama in\nthe forest before the abduction of Sita. The account of his sallying forth, of\nhis battle with Rama and of his death by the fiery dart of that hero occupies\ntwo Cantos which I entirely pass over. Indrajit again comes forth and,\nrendered invisible by his magic art slays countless Vanars with his unerring\narrows. He retires to the city and returns bearing in his chariot an effigy of\nSita, the work of magic, weeping and wailing by his side. He grasps the lovely\nimage by the hair and cuts it down with his scimitar in the sight of the\nenraged Hanuman and all the Vanar host. At last after much fighting of the\nusual kind Indrajit's chariot is broken in pieces, his charioteer is slain,\nand he himself falls by Lakshman's hand, to the inexpressible delight of the\nhigh-souled saints, the nymphs of heaven aud other celestial beings.\n\n[487:1b](ry472.htm#fr_1011) The Lokapalas are sometimes regarded as deities\nappointed by Brahma at the creation of the word* to act as guardians of\ndifferent orders of beings, but more commonly they are identified with the\ndeities presiding over the four cardinal and four intermediate points of the\ncompass, which, according to Manu V.96, are 1, Indra, guardian of the East; 2,\nAgni, of the South-east; 3, Yama, of the South; 4, Surya, of the South-west:\n5, Varuna, of the West; 6, Pavana or Vayu, of the North-west; 7, Kuvera, of\nthe North; 8, Soma or Chandra, of the North-east.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XCVI.: Ravan's Sally.](ry473.htm)\n\n"
