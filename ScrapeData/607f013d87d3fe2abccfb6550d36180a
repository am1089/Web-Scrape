It was\nthere my grandfather became a Christian. He and his wife, and all the family,\nbecame Christians at once, and when his father heard it he was very angry, and\nturned them all out of the house. There were very few Christians in those\ndays. Now you see Christians everywhere, but then we were very proud to see\none anywhere. My grandfather was Havildar  1 in the English army; and when the\nEnglish fought against Tippo Sahib my grandmother followed him all through the\nwar. She was a very tall, fine, handsome woman, and very strong; wherever the\nregiment marched she went, on, on, on, on, on (\'great deal hard work that old\nwoman done\'). Plenty stories my granny used to tell about Tippo and how Tippo\nwas killed, and about Wellesley Sahib, and Monro Sahib, and Malcolm Sahib, and\nElphinstone Sahib  2 Plenty things had that old woman heard and seen. Ah, he\nwas a good man, Elphinstone Sahib! My granny used often to tell us how he\nwould go down and say to the soldiers, \'Baba,  3 Baba, fight well. Win the\nbattles, and each man shall have his cap full of money; and after the war is\nover I\'ll send every one of you to his own home.\' (And he did do it.) Then we\nchildren \'plenty proud\' when we heard what Elphinstone Sahib had said. In\nthose days the soldiers were not low-caste people like they are now. Many very\nhigh caste men, and come from very far, from Goa, and Calicut, and Malabar, to\njoin the English.\n\nMy father was a tent lascar,  4 and when the war was over my grandfather had\nwon five medals for all the good he had done, and my father had three; and my\nfather was given charge of the Kirkee stores.  5 My grandmother and mother,\nand all the family, were in those woods behind Poona at time of the battle at\nKirkee  6 I \'ve often heard my father say how full the river was after the\nbattle--baggage and bundles floating down, and men trying to swim across--and\nhorses and all such a bustle. Many people got good things on that day. My\nfather got a large chattee, and two good ponies that were in the river, and he\ntook them home to camp; but when he got there the guard took them away. So all\nhis trouble did him no good.\n\nWe were poor people, but living was cheap, and we had \'plenty comfort.\'\n\nIn those days house rent did not cost more than half a rupee  7 a month, and\nyou could build a very comfortable house for a hundred rupees. Not such good\nhouses as people now live in, but well enough for people like us. Then a whole\nfamily could live as comfortably on six or seven rupees a month as they can\nnow on thirty. Grain, now a rupee a pound, was then two annas a pound. Common\nsugar, then one anna a pound, is now worth four annas a pound. Oil which then\nsold for six pice a bottle now costs four annas. Four annas\' worth of salt,\nchillies, tamarinds, onions, and garlic, would then last a family a whole\nmonth, now the same money would not buy a week\'s supply. Such dungaree  8 as\nyou now pay half rupee a yard for, you could then buy from twenty to forty\nyards of for the rupee. You could not get such good calico then as now, but\nthe dungeree did very well. Beef then was a pice a pound, and the vegetables\ncost a pie a day. For half a rupee you could fill the house with wood. Water\nalso was much cheaper. You could then get a man to bring you two large skins\nfull, morning and evening, for a pie, now he would not do it under half a\nrupee or more. If the children came crying for fruit, a pie would get them as\nmany guavas as they liked in the bazaar. Now you \'d have to pay that for each\nguava. This shows how much more money people need now than they did then.  9\n\nThe English fixed the rupee to the value of sixteen annas; in those days there\nwere some big annas and some little ones, and you could sometimes get twenty-\ntwo annas for a rupee.\n\nI had seven brothers and one sister. Things were very different in those days\nto what they are now. There were no schools then to send the children to, it\nwas only the great people who could read and write. If a man was known to be\nable to write he was \'plenty proud,\' and hundreds and hundreds of people would\ncome to him to write their letters. Now you find a pen and ink in every house!\nI don\'t know what good all this reading and writing does. My grandfather\ncouldn\'t write, and my father couldn\'t write, and they did very well; but\nall\'s changed now.\n\nMy father used to be out all day at his work, and my mother often went to do\ncoolie-work,  10 and she had to take my father his dinner (my mother did\nplenty work in the world); and when my granny was strong enough she used\nsometimes to go into the bazaar, if we wanted money, and grind rice for the\nshopkeepers, and they gave her half a rupee for her day\'s work, and used to\nlet her have the bran and chaff besides. But afterwards she got too old to do\nthat, and besides there were so many of us children. So she used to stay at\nhome and look after us while my mother was at work. \'Plenty bother\' \'tis to\nlook after a lot of children. No sooner my granny\'s back turned than we all\nran out in the sun, and played with the dust and stones on the road.\n\nThen my granny would call out to us, \'Come here, children, out of the sun, and\nI\'ll tell you a story. Come in, you\'ll all get headaches.\' So she used to get\nus together (there were nine of us, and great little fidgets, like all\nchildren) into the house; and there she\'d sit on the floor, and tell us one of\nthe stories I tell you. But then she used to make them last much longer, the\ndifferent people telling their own stories from the beginning as often as\npossible; so that by the time she\'d got to the end she had told the beginning\nover five or six times. And so she went on, talk, talk, talk, Mera Bap reh!\n11 Such a long time she\'d go on for, till all the children got quite tired and\nfell asleep. Now there are plenty of schools to which to send the children,\nbut there were no schools when I was a young girl; and the old women, who\ncould do nothing else, used to tell them stories to keep them out of mischief.\n\nWe used sometimes to ask my grandmother, \'Are those stories you tell us really\ntrue?\' Were there ever such people in the world?\' She generally answered, \'I\ndon\'t know, but may be there are somewhere.\' I don\'t believe there are any of\nthose people living; I dare say, however, they did once live; but my granny\nbelieved more in those things than we do now. She was a Christian, she\nworshipped God and believed in our Saviour, but still she would always respect\nthe Hindoo temples. If she saw a red stone, or an image of Gunputti or any of\nthe other Hindoo gods, she would kneel down and say her prayers there, for she\nused to say, \'May be there\'s something in it.\'\n\nAbout all things she would tell us pretty stories--about men, and animals, and\ntrees, and flowers, and stars. There was nothing she did not know some tale\nabout. On the bright cold-weather nights, when you can see more stars than at\nany other time of the year, we used to like to watch the sky, and she would\nshow us the Hen and Chickens,  12 and the Key,  13 and the Scorpion, and the\nSnake, and the Three Thieves climbing up to rob the Ranee\'s silver bedstead,\nwith their mother (that twinkling star far away) watching for her sons\'\nreturn. Pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat, you can see how her heart beats, for she is\nalways frightened, thinking, \'Perhaps they will be caught and hanged!\'\n\nThen she would show us the Cross,  14 that reminds us of,our Saviour\'s, and\nthe great pathway of light  15 on which He went up to heaven. It is what you\ncall the Milky Way. My granny usen\'t to call it that; she used to say that\nwhen our Lord returned up to heaven that was the way He went, and that ever\nsince it has shone in memory of His ascension, so beautiful and bright.\n\nShe always said a star with a smoky tail (comet) meant war, and she never saw\na falling star without saying, \'There\'s a great man died;\' but the fixed stars\nshe used to think were all really good people, burning like bright lamps\nbefore God.\n\nAs to the moon, my granny used to say she is most useful to debtors who can\'t\npay their debts. Thus--A man who borrows money he knows he cannot pay takes\nthe full moon for witness and surety. Then, if any man so silly as to lend him\nmoney, and go and ask him for it, he can say, \'The moon \'s my surety, go catch\nhold of the moon!\' Now, you see, no man can do that; and what\'s more, when the\nmoon\'s once full, it grows every night less and less, and at last goes out\naltogether.\n\nAll the Cobras in my grandmother\'s stories were seven-headed. This puzzled us\nchildren, and we would say to her, \'Granny, are there any seven-headed Cobras\nnow? For all the Cobras we see that the conjurors bring round have only one\nhead each.\' To which she used to answer, \'No, of course there are no seven-\nheaded Cobras now. That world is gone, but you see each Cobra has a hood of\nskin, that is the remains of another head.\' Then we would say, \'Although none\nof those old seven-headed Cobras are alive now, may be there are some of their\nchildren living somewhere.\' But at this my granny used to get vexed, and say,\n\'Nonsense, you are silly little chatterboxes, get along with you.\' And, though\nwe often looked for the seven-headed Cobras, we never could find any of them.\n\nMy old granny lived till she was nearly a hundred: when she got very old she\nrather lost her memory, and often made mistakes in the stories she told us,\ntelling a bit of one story and then joining on to it a bit of some other; for\nwe children bothered her too much about them, and sometimes she used to get\nvery tired of talking, and when we asked her for a story, would answer, \'You\nmust ask your mother about it, she can tell you.\'\n\nAh! those were happy days, and we had plenty ways to amuse ourselves. I was\nvery fond of pets: when I was seven years old I had a little dog that followed\nme everywhere, and played all sorts of pretty tricks, and I and my youngest\nbrother used to take the little sparrows out of their nests on the roof of our\nhouse, and tame them. These little birds got so fond of me they would always\nfly after me; as I was sweeping the floor one would perch on my head, and two\nor three on my shoulders, and the rest came fluttering after. But my poor\nfather and mother used to shake their heads at me when they saw this, and say,\n\'Ah! naughty girl, to take the little birds out of their nests; that stealing\nwill bring you no good.\' All my family were very fond of music. You know that\nRosie (my daughter) sings very nicely and plays upon the guitar, and my son-\nin-law plays on the pianoforte and the fiddle (we\'ve got two fiddles in our\nhouse now), but Mera Bap reh! how well my grandfather sang! Sometimes of an\nevening he would drink a little toddy,  16 and be quite cheerful, and sing\naway; and all we children liked to hear him. I was very fond of singing. I had\na good voice when I was young, and my father used to be so fond of making me\nsing, and I often sang to him that Calicut song about the ships sailing on the\nsea  17 and the little wife watching for her husband to come back, and plenty\nmore that I forget now; and thy father and brothers would be so pleased at my\nsinging, and laugh and say, \'That girl can do anything.\' But now my voice is\ngone, and I didn\'t care to sing any more since my son died, and my heart been\nso sad.\n\nIn those days there were much fewer houses in Poona than there are now, and\nmany more wandering gipsies, and such like. They were very troublesome, doing\nnothing but begging and stealing, but people gave them all they wanted, as it\nwas believed that to incur their ill-will was very dangerous. It was not safe\neven to speak harshly of them. I remember one day, when I was quite a little\ngirl, running along by my mother\'s side, when she was on her way to the\nbazaar, we happened to pass the huts of some of these people; and I said to\nher, \'See, mother, what nasty, dirty people those are; they live in such ugly\nlittle houses, and they look as if they never combed their hair nor washed.\'\nWhen I said this my mother turned round quite sharply and boxed my ears,\nsaying, \'Because God has given you a comfortable home and good parents, is\nthat any reason for you to laugh at others who are poorer and less happy?\'--\'\nI meant no harm,\' I said, and when we got home I told my father what my mother\nhad done, and he said to her, \'Why did you slap the child?\' She answered, \'If\nyou want to know, ask your daughter why I punished her. You will then be able\nto judge whether I was right or not.\' So I told my father what I had said\nabout the gipsies, and when I told him, instead of pitying me, he also boxed\nmy ears very hard. So that was all I got for telling tales against my mother!\n\nBut they both did it, fearing if I spoke evil of the gipsies and were not\ninstantly punished some dreadful evil would befall me.\n\nIt was after my granny that I was named \'Anna Liberata.\' She died after my\nfather, and when I was eleven years old. Her eyes were quite bright, her hair\nblack, and her teeth good to the last. If I\'d been older then, I should have\nbeen able to remember more of her stories. Such a number as she used to tell!\nI\'m afraid my sister would not be able to remember any of them. She has had\nmuch trouble; that puts those sort of things out of people\'s heads; besides,\nshe is a goose. She is younger than I am, although you would think her so much\nolder, for her hair turned grey when she was very young, while mine is quite\nblack still She is almost bald too, now, as she pulled out her hair because it\nwas grey. I always said to her, \'Don\'t do so; for you can\'t make yourself any\nyounger, and it is better when you are getting old to look old. Then people\nwill do whatever you ask them! But however old you may be, if you look young,\nthey\'ll say to you, "You are young enough and strong enough to do your own\nwork yourself."\n\nMy mother used to tell us stories too; but not so many as my granny. A few\nyears ago there might be found several old people who knew those sort of\nstories; but now children go to school, and nobody thinks of remembering or\ntelling them--they\'ll soon be all forgotten. It is true there are books with\nsome stories something like these, but they always put them down wrong.\nSometimes, when I cannot remember a bit of a story, I ask some one about it;\nthen they say, \'There is a story of that name in my book. I don\'t know it, but\nI\'ll read.\' Then they read it to me, but it is all wrong, so that I get quite\ncross, and make them shut up the book. For in the books they cut the stories\nquite short, and leave out the prettiest part, and they jumble up the\nbeginning of one story with the end of another--so that it is a! together\nwrong.\n\nWhen I was young, old people used to be very fond of telling these stories;\nbut instead of that, it seems to me that now the old people are fond of\nnothing but making money.\n\nThen I was married. I was twelve years old then. Our native people have a very\nhappy life till we marry. The girls live with their father and mother, and\nbrothers and sisters, and have got nothing to do but amuse themselves, and got\nfather and mother to take care of them; but after they\'re married they go to\nlive at their husband\'s house, and the husband\'s mother and sisters are often\nvery unkind to them.\n\nYou English people can\'t understand that sort of thing. When an Englishman\nmarries, he goes to a new house, and his wife is the mistress of it; but our\nnative people are very different. If the father is dead, the mother and\nunmarried sisters live in the son\'s house, and rule it; his wife is nothing in\nthe house. And the mother and sisters say to the son\'s wife, \'This is not your\nhouse--you \'ye not always lived in it;--you cannot be mistress here.\'\n\nAnd if the wife complains to her husband, and he speaks about it, they say,\n\'Very well, if you are such an unnatural son you \'d better turn your mother\nand sisters out of doors; but while we live here, we\'ll rule the house.\' So\nthere is always plenty fighting. It \'s not unkind of the mother and sisters--\nit \'s custom.\n\nMy husband was a servant in Government House--that was when Lord Clare was\nGovernor here. When I was twenty years old, my husband died of a bad fever,\nand left me with two children--the boy and the girl, Rosie.\n\nI had no money to keep them with, so I said, \'I\'ll go to service,\' and my\nmother-in-law said, \'How can you go with two children, and so young, and\nknowing nothing?\' But I said, \'I can learn, and I\'ll go;\' and a kind lady took\nme into her service. When I went to my first place, I hardly knew a word of\nEnglish (though I knew our Calicut language, and Portuguese, and Hindostani,\nand Mahratti well enough) and I could not hold a needle. I was so stupid, like\na Coolie-woman;  18 but my mistress was very kind to me, and I soon learnt;\nshe did not mind the trouble of teaching me. I often think, \'Where find such\ngood Christian people in these days?\' To take a poor, stupid woman and her two\nchildren into the house--for I had them both with me, Rosie and the boy. I was\na sharp girl in those days; I did my mistress\'s work and I looked after the\nchildren too. I never left them to any one else. If she wanted me for a long\ntime, I used to bring the children into the room and set them down on the\nfloor, so as to have them under my own eye whilst I did her work. My mistress\nwas very fond of Rosie, and used to teach her to work and read. After some\ntime my mistress went home, and since then I \'ye been in eight places. One\nlady with whom I stayed wished to take me to England with her when she went\nhome (at that time the children neither little or big), and she offered to\ngive me Rs. 5000 and warm clothes if I would go with her; but I wouldn\'t go. I\na silly girl then, and afraid of going from the children and on the sea; I\nthink--\' May be I shall make plenty money, but what good if all the little\nfishes eat my bones? I shall not rest with my old Father and Mother if I go \'\n--so I told her I could not do it.\n\nMy brother-in-law was valet at that time to Napier Sahib, 19 up in Sind. All\nthe people and servants were very fond of that Sahib. My brother-in-law was\nwith him for ten years; and he wanted me to go up there to get place as ayah,\nand said, \'You quick, sharp girl, and know English very well; you easily get\ngood place and make plenty money.\' But I such a foolish woman I would not go.\nI write and tell him, \'No, I can\'t come, for Sind such a long way off, and I\ncannot leave the children.\' I \'plenty proud\' then. I give up all for the\nchildren. But now what good? I know your language--What use? To blow the fire?\nI only a miserable woman, fit to go to cook-room and cook the dinner. So go\ndown in the world, a poor woman: (not much good to have plenty in head, and\nempty pocket!) but if I\'d been a man I might now be a Fouzdar.  20\n\nI was at Kolapore  21 at the time of the mutiny, and we had to run away in the\nmiddle of the night; but I\'ve told you before all about that. Then seven years\nago my mother died (she was ninety when she died), and we came back to live at\nPoona.\n\nNot long afterwards my daughter was married there, and I was so happy and\npleased I gave a feast then to three hundred people, and we had music and\ndancing, and my son, he so proud, he dancing from morning to night, and\nrunning here and there arranging everything; and on that day, I said, \'Throw\nthe doors open, and any beggar, any poor person come here, give them what they\nlike to eat, for whoever comes shall have enough, since there \'s no more work\nfor me in the world.\' So, thinking I should be able to leave service, and give\nup work, I spent all the money I had left. That was not very much, for in\nsending my spn to school I\'d spent a great deal. He was such a beauty boy--\ntall, straight, handsome--and so clever. They used to say he looked more like\nmy brother than my son, and he said to me, \'Mammy, you\'ve worked for us all\nyour life, now I\'m grown up I\'ll get a clerk\'s place and work for you. You\nshall work no more, but live in my house.\' But last year he was drowned in the\nriver. That was my great sad. Since then I couldn\'t lift up my head. I can\'t\nremember things now as I used to do, and all is muddled in my head, six and\nseven. It makes me sad sometimes to hear you laughing and talking so happy\nwith your father and mother and all your family, when I think of my father,\nand mother, and brothers, and husband, and son, all dead and gone! No more\nhappy home like that for me. What should I care to live for? I would come to\nEngland with you, for I know you would be good to me and bury me when I die,\nbut I cannot go so far from Rosie. My one eye put out, my other eye left. I\ncould not lose it too. If it were not for Rosie and her children I should like\nto travel about and see the world. There are four places I have always wished\nto see--Calcutta, Madras, England, and Jerusalem (my poor mother always wished\nto see Jerusalem too--that her great hope), but I shall not see them now. Many\nladies wanted to take me to England with them, and if I had gone I should have\nsaved plenty money, but now it is too late to think of that. Besides, it would\nnot be much use. What \'s the good of my saving money? Can I take it away with\nme when I die? My father and grandfather did not do so, and they had enough to\nlive on till they died. I have enough for what I want, and I\'ve plenty poor\nrelations. They all come to me asking for money, and I give it them. I thank\nour Saviour there are enough good Christians here to give me a slice of bread\nand cup of water when I can\'t work for it. I do not fear to come to want.\n\n\n\nGOVERNMENT HOUSE,\n\nPARELL, BOMBAY, 1866.\n\n[![](tn/06.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/06.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1](odd04.htm#fr_2) Sergeant of native troops.\n\n[2](odd04.htm#fr_3) The Duke of Wellington, Sir Thomas Monro.
