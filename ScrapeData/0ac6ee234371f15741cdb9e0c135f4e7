And because the kshattriyahood (of _G_ ana _s_ ruti) is understood from\nthe inferential mark (supplied by his being mentioned) later on with _K_\naitraratha (who was a kshattriya himself).\n\n_\n\nG_ana _s_ ruti cannot have been a _S_ udra by birth for that reason also that\nhis being a kshattriya is understood from an inferential sign, viz. his being\nmentioned together (in one chapter) with the kshattriya _K_ aitraratha\nAbhipratarin. For, later on, i.e. in the passage complementary to the sa _m_\nvarga-vidya, a kshattriya _K_ aitrarathi Abhipratarin is glorified, 'Once\nwhile _S_ aunaka Kapeya and Abhipratarin Kakshaseni were being waited on at\ntheir meal a religious student begged of them' ( _Kh_. Up. IV, 3, 5). That\nthis Abhipratarin was a _K_ aitrarathi (i.e. a descendant of _K_ itraratha) we\nhave to infer from his connexion with a Kapeya. For we know (from _S_ ruti)\nabout the connexion of _K_ itraratha himself with the Kapeyas ('the Kapeyas\nmade _K_ itraratha perform that sacrifice;' Ta _nd_ ya. Br. XX, 12, 5), and as\na rule sacrificers of one and the same family employ officiating priests of\none and the same family. Moreover, as we understand from Scripture ('from him\na _K_ aitrarathi descended who was a prince 2') that he ( _K_ aitraratha) was\na prince, we must\n\np. 227\n\nunderstand him to have been a kshattriya. The fact now of _G_ ana _s_ ruti\nbeing praised in the same vidya with the kshattriya Abhipratarin intimates\nthat the former also was a kshattriya. For as a rule equals are mentioned\ntogether with equals. That _G_ ana _s_ ruti was a kshattriya we moreover\nconclude from his sending his door-keeper and from other similar signs of\npower (mentioned in the text).--Hence the _S_ udras are not qualified (for the\nknowledge of Brahman).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[226:2](sbe34104.htm#fr_228) I translate this passage as I find it in all MSS.\nof _S_ a _n_ kara consulted by me (noting, however, that some MSS. read _k_\naitrarathinamaika _h_ ). \xc3\x82nanda Giri expressly explains tasmad by _k_\naitrarathad ity artha _h_.--The text of the Ta _nd_ ya Br. runs: tasma _k_ _k_\naitrarathinam eka _h_ kshatrapatir gayate, and the commentary explains: tasmat\nkara _n_ ad adyapi _k_ itrava _ms_ otpannana _m_ madhye eka eva ra _g_ a\nkshatrapatir p. 227 baladhipatir bhavati.--Grammar does not authorise the form\n_k_ aitraratha used in the Sutra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 36](sbe34105.htm)\n\n"
