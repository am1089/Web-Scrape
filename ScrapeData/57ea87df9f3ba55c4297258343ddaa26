Janamejaya said :-- \xc2\x93O Brahma _n_ a! You have described in detail the\nwonderful character of Indra, his displacement from his Heavens, and his\nsuffering many hardships and at the same time, you have described very widely\nthe greatness of the Highest Goddess of the world. But one doubt has arisen in\nmy mind that Indra was very powerful and when he got the lordship over the\nDevas, which means in other words that no trouble would pain him, how was it\nthat he had to feel pain and agony? He got the Lordship of the Devas and his\nhighest position by performing one hundred Horse Sacrifices; how was it, then\nthat he was again displaced from that position? O Ocean of mercy! Kindly\nexplain to me the causes of all these. You know everything; you are the best\nof the Munis and the maker of the Pura _n_ as; I am your devoted disciple;\ntherefore nothing there can be that cannot be mentioned to me. So, O highly\nfortunate One! Kindly remove my doubts.\xc2\x94 Suta said :-- Thus asked by\nJanamejaya, Vyasa the son of Satyavati gladly spoke, in due order, the\nfollowing words :--\n\n\n\np. 516\n\n\n\n6-29. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hear, then the causes that are certainly very\nwonderful. The seers say that Karma is of three kinds :-- Sa\xc3\xb1chita\n(accumulated), Vartamana (present) and Prarabdha (commenced). Each of these is\nagain subdivided into three, Sattvik, Rajasik, and Tamasik. The accumulated\neffects of Karmas done in many past lives is called Sa\xc3\xb1chita, O King! The\neffects of this Sanchita Karma, be it auspicious or inauspicious, be it for a\nlong or for a short time, must have to be enjoyed by the beings whether they\nbe good or bad. This Sa\xc3\xb1chita Karma done by the embodied beings in several\nprevious births, can never be totally exhausted even in hundred Ko _t_ i\nKalpas without their being enjoyed. The Karma that is being done by a Jiva and\nthat has not as yet been completed, that is called Vartamana Karma. The Jivas\ndo this Vartamana Karma, auspicious or inauspicious, in their present\nembodiments. At the time of birth, a part of the Sa\xc3\xb1chita Karma, the soul\ntakes up for fructification. This part of Sa\xc3\xb1chita Karma is called Prarabdha\nKarma. This exhausts only when its effects have been fully borne out by the\nembodied soul. The beings cannot but bear the effects of this Prarabdha Karma.\nO King! Know this for certain that the effects of merits or demerits done\npreviously must be borne by anybody, be he a Deva, or a man, or an Asura, or a\nYak _s_ a or a Gandharba. The acts done previously go to form the new births\nof all beings. When the Karma gets exhausted, then no more birth takes place.\nThere is no doubt in this. Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, Rudra, Indra and the other\nDevas, the Danavas, Yak _s_ as, Gandharbas, all are under the control of this\nKarma. O King! Were it not so, how could they get bodies that are the causes\nof the enjoyments of pains and pleasures of all the beings. Therefore, O King!\nOut of the Sa\xc3\xb1chita Karmas done in many previous births, some Karmas get ripe\nin due time and they manifest themselves; those manifested Sa\xc3\xb1chita Karmas are\ncalled Prarabdha Karmas (those that are being enjoyed by an individual in the\npresent birth). Impelled by this Prarabdha Karma, the Devas and the human\nbeings, all do meritorious acts as well as sinful acts. Thus Indra out of his\npast meritorious acts attained his Indraship, and, out of his past sinful\nacts, committed the sin Brahmahattya and so he was dislodged from his\nIndraship. What doubt can exist here? O King! So Nara and Narayana, the sons\nof Dharma, had to take births out of their previous Karmas; again Arju _n_ a\nand Kri _sn_ a were born out of their Karmic effects as part incarnations of\nthis Nara and Narayana. The Munis describe this Karma as the basis of the Pura\n_n_ as. Know that he is born of a Deva who is very wealthy and prosperous; he\nwho is not born of the part of a Muni, never writes any spiritual treatise on\nJ\xc3\xb1ana or Knowledge; he who is not born of Rudra, never worships Rudra; who is\nnot born of a Deva never distributes rice in charity; he who is not born\n\n\n\np. 517\n\n\n\nof S'ri Vi _sn_ u, never becomes the king and lord of the earth. O King! The\nembodied souls derive their bodies certainly from Indra, Agni, Yama, Vi _sn_\nu, and Kuvera. Indra presides over lordship, Agni presides over energy, Yama\npresides over anger, and Vi _sn_ u presides over strength. He who is powerful,\nfortunate, enjoying many enjoyments, learned, charitable, is said to be born\nof a Devams'a. O Lord of the earth! Similarly the Pa _nd_ avas and Vasudeva\nwho was as glorious as Narayana were born of Devams'as. O King! Know this as\nquite certain that the bodies of the Jivas are the receptacles of pains and\npleasures; and the embodied souls (Jivas) experience alternately pleasure and\npain. No Jiva is independent; he is always under the Great Fate. He\nexperiences birth, death, pleasure and pain, not out of his self will, but\ncompelled and guided, as it were, by the unseen Fate.\n\n\n\n30-41. O King! How very strong is that Fate can easily be judged by the\nfollowing. The Pa _nd_ avas were born in forest; then they went their own\nhomes. They performed the Great Rajasuya Sacrifice by virtue of their own\nstrength. After this they had to suffer their exiles in forest a much greater\nand more terrible hardship indeed! Next Arju _n_ a performed a very hard\nasceticism when the Devas, not self-controlled, became pleased and granted him\nan auspicious boon. Still he could not extricate himself from the hands of the\nterrible hardship; nowhere could be found the fruits of the merits acquired in\nthe past when he was afterwards remaining in exile in his human body in the\nforest! The severe tapasya that he did in the Vadarikasrama in his past\nincarnation as Nara, the son of Dharma, did not bear any fruit in his Arju _n_\na birth. Mysterious and inexplicable are the ways and means of Karma with\nwhich the bodies of the several beings are concerned. How could men get an\nidea of it when the Devas themselves are at a loss to solve it. Bhagavan\nVasudeva had to take birth in the prison, a very critical and dangerous place;\nhe was then carried by Vasudeva to the milkman Nanda's abode at Gokula; he\nremained there eleven years and thence came back to Mathura where he killed by\nforce Kamsa, the son of \xc3\x9bgrasena. Then he released his sorrowful father and\nmother from the bonds of prison and made \xc3\x9bgrasena, the King of Mathura.\nAfterwards he went to Dvarka city, out of the fear of Kala Yavana, the King of\nthe Mlechchas; thus Janardana Kri _sn_ a performed many great and heroic\ndeeds, being impelled by Fate. Then he left his mortal coil at Prabhasa, a\nplace of pilgrimage, along with his relatives and acquaintances and then\nascended to his Vaikun _t_ ha abode. All the Yadavas, sons, grandsons,\nfriends, brothers, sisters and ladies of the houses all died under the curse\nof a Brahmi _n_. O King! I have thus described to you the inexplicable ways of\nKarma.\n\n\n\np. 518\n\n\n\nWhat more shall I say than the fact that Vasudeva was killed by the arrows of\na hunter!\n\n\n\nHere ends the Tenth Chapter of the Sixth Book on the phase of Karma in the\nMahapura _n_ am S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda\nVyasa.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 11](bk06ch11.htm)\n\n"
