Subrahmanyam, [1911], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. i\n\n### INTRODUCTION.\n\nThis Garu\xe1\xb8\x8da Pur\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a S\xc4\x81rodhh\xc4\x81ra (Extracted essence of the Garu\xe1\xb8\x8da Pur\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a) was\ncompiled or written by one Navanidhir\xc4\x81ma, son of \xc5\x9ar\xc4\xab Hari N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a, who lived\nin the city of Jhunjhu\xe1\xb9\x87\xc5\xab, which was ruled by a King \xc5\x9ar\xc4\xab S\xc5\xabkhal\xc4\x81laj\xc4\xab. It was\ndone for the helping of those who cannot understand the difficult earlier\nworks; but itself is not easy to understand, and required much labour, the\nauthor informs us. It is entirely originally written, he says, and comprises\nthe results of very deep study of the sacred books, and is the extracted\nessence of them on the subjects with which it deals.\n\nIt is used all over India at funeral ceremonies, but some are afraid to read\nit on other occasions, thinking it inauspicious.\n\nCHAPTERS I to VII deal with Hells.\n\nCHAPTERS VII to XIII deal with Ceremonies for the dead.\n\nCHAPTER XIV deals with Heaven.\n\nCHAPTERS XV & XVI deal with Yoga and liberation.\n\nThe neo-theosophists, among the great good they have done to the world, have\nrevived the idea that Hell is a living reality, and not a superstitious\nfiction, created by a designing priestcraft, to keep Humanity on its good\nbehavior. Among the educated, with the vanishing of the belief in an after-\nlife, has vanished also the belief in Hell. But owing to the labors of the\nPsychical Research Society and similar other bodies, there are few educated\npersons now, who deny the existence of the afterlife, as they used to do some\nthirty years back. But though the belief in after-life has revived, yet the\ncognate belief in Heaven and Hell is still very vague. Our Hindu Puranas,\nhowever, among the great mass of rubbish that they contain, have always been\nvery clear on this question of Heaven and Hell. Serious writers of law books\nalso like Y\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1avalkya and Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u have described as-seriously the existences of\nvarious Hells, as they have done the various joys of Heaven. No doubt, the\nsubject of Hell is not a very savoury one, and nervous persons have always\nfought shy of studying this unpleasant department of existence. But, pleasant\nor unpleasant, the science does not take into account the human feelings. No\none is forced to study the subject, unless he feels strong enough to do so, as\nno one is bound to study Medicine, unless he is prepared to face the scenes of\nthe dissecting room.\n\np. ii\n\nThe question then is, do these hells really exist? If so, where? This is a\nquestion of fact, and must be decided like all questions of fact, on the\nevidence of reliable witnesses who have, from personal experience, described\nthis region. To a Hindu there is needed no greater testimony than that of Yogi\nY\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1avalkya who, in the Pr\xc4\x81ya\xc5\x9bchitta Adhy\xc4\x81ya of his law book, mentions 21\nhells. The author of Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u Sm\xe1\xb9\x9biti also has followed in his footsteps. Hell,\nthen, according to Hindu seers, is a particular locality walled off from the\nsurrounding regions of space by the messengers of Yama, the ruler of Hell.\nWithin this particular space so specially guarded, no joy can enter. It is a\nregion of pain--sharp. intense and severe. Sinners clothed in their painful\nbodies (j\xc4\x81tana deha)--replica of their physical bodies, though made of subtler\nmatter, suffer the punishments deserved by their sins. But there is one\ndistinguishing mark between the Hindu idea of Hell and that of votaries of\nSemitic creeds. The punishment in Hell is not eternal. It is Reformatory and\nEducative. The hell punishment is not remembered by the soul when it is re-\nborn, no more than it remembers the joys of heaven. But the permanent\neducative effect remains in that part of the sold--called the conscience. The\nnatural fear, which certain souls feel at the sight of temptation to sin, is\nthe result of the finer development of conscience, in the furnace of hell-\nfire. This is the permanent gain which the soul has acquired, and which it\nwill never lose through ages to come, by passing through the bitterness of the\nvalley of Yama--the merciful ruler of Hell.\n\nWhere is then this Hell situated? According to Hindu belief, its locality is\nin the astral region of the physical South Pole, as the Heaven is situate in\nthe astral region of the physical North Pole. As a prison house is a prison\nonly to the criminal, but not to the visitor, who goes there on his mission of\nmercy and charity, so Hell is a place of punishment and pain only to the\nsinners and not to those who go there on similar missions. The readers of the\nHindu Sacred literature will no doubt remember the beautiful episode of\nNachiketas going to Hell, and learning from its Ruler the secret of cosmic\nevolution, miscalled the secret of death.\n\nThe twenty-two hells are described in the Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u Sm\xe1\xb9\x9biti.\n\n(See Sacred Books of the East, Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u Sm\xe1\xb9\x9biti, pp. 140-141, verse 22,\nLohach\xc4\x81raka).\n\nAfter being thus purified by Hell-fire, the soul is re-born with keener\nconscience and under circumstances where it can, if it so chooses, make better\nuse of its faculties. Says Y\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1avalkya in verse 218 of the Third\n\np. iii\n\n[paragraph continues] Adhy\xc4\x81ya that the lords of mercy place such souls in very\nfavourable circumstances afterwards. *\n\nBut if the soul so favourably placed, omits to do good action or commits evil\ndeeds again, and leaves its senses unrestrained, there is again a fall for\nthat soul, as is mentioned in the next verse. \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nIs there any physical Hell also, or is it in the astral plane only? As Heaven\nis both physical and astral, and as the Svarga is on the physical plane also,\nwhere the great \xe1\xb9\x9bi\xe1\xb9\xa3is like Vy\xc4\x81sa, A\xc5\x9bvath\xc4\x81man, M\xc4\x81rka\xe1\xb9\x87deya and others are said\nto be still living in their physical bodies, so there are physical hells also,\nthough not known as Hells. What are these prison houses in every well-governed\ncommunity but physical hells? What is this outcasting by the society, but\nmaking one feel the torture of hell, in fact Gautama in his law book\ndefinitely calls this stage hell, and some say that Gautama did not believe,\nin another form of hell.\n\nThus the fact of concrete existence of hell cannot be doubted. Leaving the\ntestimony of Hindu seers aside, in modern times we have the evidence of a\nhard-headed man of science like Swedenborg, of a refined artist and poet like\nDante, and the great sage R\xc4\x81mk\xe1\xb9\x9bi\xe1\xb9\xa3na Paramaha\xe1\xb9\x83sa.\n\nIs there any means by which a man may save himself from the pains of hell? On\nthis point, our ancient authors held different opinions. One class of thinkers\nheld the view that sin could not be expiated by any act of man, however\n[meritorious](errata.htm#0) it be in its nature, but one must suffer the full\nconsequences of his sins. The later view, which has gained ascendency now, is\nthat for the intentional mortal sins--k\xc4\x81ma k\xe1\xb9\x9bitamah\xc4\x81p\xc4\x81taka,--there is no\npenance, except the death penance, which can save the man from future\ntroubles. Several kinds of death penances are described in our law books, and\nin this age, a very salutary rule is laid down by the pa\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8dits that no death\npenance should ever be described, if a sinner asks the pa\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8dit for the\nappropriate penance of his sin. Thus in certain cases of incest, the only\noperative penance is to embrace a red-hot iron image and die in that way.\nSimilarly, the penance for drinking spirituous liquors is death by drinking\nboiling liquors or butter. But no Pa\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8dit is allowed, by the rule of the\npresent Iron age, to describe these death penances to any sinner. The result\ntherefore, is that according to the law, every mortal sinner must pass through\nthe period of purificatory process of hell. For minor sins, the rule is\ndifferent. The after-life consequences can be warded off by appropriate\npenances. And here is a rich field which the\n\np. iv\n\n[paragraph continues] Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87 priestcraft of India, preying on the gullibility\nof its votaries, has exploited to its extreme extent. For every sin, there is\na penance, and also a pilgrimage, with its concomitant result in the shape of\nso much fee (dak\xe1\xb9\xa3i\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81) to be paid to the Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87.\n\nPenances have become a farce in Modern India. Like the dispensations of the\nPopes of Rome, penances can be compounded by the payment of amounts ranging\nfrom a cowrie shell to thousands of rupees to Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87s. It is not that the\ngifts to a deserving man washes away sins, for modern Hinduism has done\neverything in its power to throw in \'the background that rational idea, but a\ngift to a Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87, however bad he may be, as the saying goes that no one feeds\na docile donkey, but a kicking cow, for the sake of her milk. This presupposes\nthat a kicking Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87 has milk to give, which is far from the truth.\n\nThe practice of Pr\xc4\x81ya\xc5\x9bchittas or penances is based upon a more rational basis.\nRepentance for sin is the highest pr\xc4\x81ya\xc5\x9bchitta, the infliction of bodily pains\nis of secondary importance. One who has performed such penance has exhausted\nthe evil effects of his sins and for him there is no penance.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[iii:*](gpu02.htm#fr_0) "Afterwards freed from all sins, they are born in high\nfamilies, where they enjoy pleasures, and become accomplished in arts and\nsciences, and possessed of wealth."\n\n[iii:\xe2\x80\xa0](gpu02.htm#fr_1) Mandalik\'s Hindu Law, p. 265, verse 219.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter I.
