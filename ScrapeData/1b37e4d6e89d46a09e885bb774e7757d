(On the part of the soul's descending from the\n\np. 127\n\nmoon) there is entering into similarity of being (with ether and so on); as\nthis (only) is possible.\n\nIt has been explained that the souls of those who perform sacrifices, &c.,\nafter having reached the moon dwell there as long as their works last and then\nre-descend with a remainder of their works. We now have to inquire into the\nmode of that descent. On this point scripture makes the following statement:\n'They return again the way they came, to the ether, from the ether to the air.\nThen the sacrificer having become air becomes smoke, having become smoke he\nbecomes mist, having become mist he becomes a cloud, having become a cloud he\nrains down.'--Here a doubt arises whether the descending souls pass over into\na state of identity with ether, &c., or into a state of similarity.--The\npurvapakshin maintains that the state is one of identity, because this is\ndirectly stated by the text. Otherwise there would take place so-called\nindication (laksha _n_ a). Now whenever the doubt lies between a directly\nexpressed and a merely indicated meaning the former is to be preferred. Thus\nthe following words also, 'Having become air he becomes smoke,' &c., are\nappropriate only if the soul be understood to identify itself with them.--\nHence it follows that the souls become identical with ether, &c.--To this we\nreply that they only pass into a state of similarity to ether, &c. When the\nbody, consisting of water which the soul had assumed in the sphere of the moon\nfor the purpose of enjoyment, dissolves at the time when that enjoyment comes\nto an end, then it becomes subtle like ether, passes thereupon into the power\nof the air, and then gets mixed with smoke, &c. This is the meaning of the\nclauses, 'They return as they came to the ether, from the ether to the air,\n&c.'--How is this known to be the meaning?--Because thus only it is possible.\nFor it is not possible that one thing should become another in the literal\nsense of the word. If, moreover, the souls became identified with ether they\ncould no longer descend through air, &c. And as connexion with the ether is,\non account of its all-pervadingness, eternal, no other connexion (of the\nsouls) with it can here be meant\n\np. 128\n\nbut their entering into a state of similarity to it 1. And in cases where it\nis impossible to accept the literal meaning of the text it is quite proper to\nassume the meaning which is merely indicated.--For these reasons the souls'\nbecoming ether, &c., has to be taken in the secondary sense of their passing\ninto a state of similarity to ether, and so on.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[128:1](sbe38098.htm#fr_98) It might be said that the relation to ether, &c.,\ninto which the souls enter, is the relation of conjunction (sa _m_ yoga), not\nthe relation of similarity. But as nothing can enter into the relation of sa\n_m_ yoga with ether (everything being in eternal sa _m_ yoga with it) we must\nassume that 'becoming ether' means 'becoming like ether,' and by parity of\nreasoning, that 'becoming air, &c.,' means 'becoming like air.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 1, 23](sbe38099.htm)\n\n"
