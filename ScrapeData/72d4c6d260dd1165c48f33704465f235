The word \'austerity\' (must be understood to apply) to (the observance of)\nthe rules (of studentship). 1\n\n2\\. If they are transgressed, study drives out the knowledge of the Veda\nacquired already, from the (offender) and from his children. 2\n\np. 19\n\n3\\. Besides he will go to hell, and his life will be shortened.\n\n4\\. On account of that (transgression of the rules of studentship) no _Ri_\nshis are born amongst the men of later ages. 4\n\n5\\. But some in their new birth, on account of a residue of the merit acquired\nby their actions (in former lives), become (similar to) _Ri_ shis by their\nknowledge (of the Veda), 5\n\n6\\. Like _S_ vetaketu. 6\n\n7\\. And whatever else besides the Veda, (a student) who obeys the rules learns\nfrom his teacher, that brings the same reward as the Veda. 7\n\n8\\. Also, if desirous to accomplish something (be\n\np. 20\n\nit good or evil), he thinks it in his mind, or pronounces it in words, or\nlooks upon it with his eye, even so it will be; thus teach (those who know the\nlaw).\n\n9\\. (The duties of a student consist in) acts to please the spiritual teacher,\nthe observance (of rules) conducive to his own welfare, and industry in\nstudying. 9\n\n10\\. Acts other than these need not be performed by a student. 10\n\n11\\. A religious student who retains what he has learned, who finds pleasure\nin the fulfilment of the law, who keeps the rules of studentship, who is\nupright and forgiving, attains perfection. 11\n\n12\\. Every day he shall rise in the last watch of the night, and standing near\nhis teacher, salute him with (this) salutation: I, N. N., ho! (salute thee.)\n12\n\n13\\. And (he shall salute) before the morning meal also other very aged\n(learned Brahma _n_ as) who may live in the same village.\n\n14\\. If he has been on a journey, (he shall salute 14\n\np. 21\n\nthe persons mentioned) when he meets them on his, return.\n\n15\\. (He may also salute the persons mentioned at other times), if he is\ndesirous of heaven and long life.\n\n16\\. A Brahma _n_ a. shall salute stretching forward his right arm on a level\nwith his ear, a Kshatriya holding it on a level with the breast, a Vai _s_ ya\nholding it on a level with the waist, a _S_ udra holding it low, (and)\nstretching forward the joined hands. 16\n\n17\\. And when returning the salute of (a man belonging) to the first (three)\ncastes, the (last syllable of the) name (of the person addressed) is produced\nto the length of three moras. 17\n\n18\\. But when he meets his teacher after sunrise (coming for his lesson), he\nshall embrace (his feet). 18\n\n19\\. On all other occasions he shall salute (him in the manner described\nabove).\n\n20\\. But some declare that he ought to embrace the (feet of his) teacher (at\nevery occasion instead of saluting him).\n\n21\\. Having stroked the teacher\'s right foot with his right hand below and\nabove, he takes hold of it and of the ankle.\n\n22\\. Some say, that he must press both feet, each with both hands, and embrace\nthem. 22\n\n23\\. He shall be very attentive the whole day 23\n\np. 22\n\nlong, never allowing his mind to wander from the lesson during the (time\ndevoted to) studying.\n\n24\\. And (at other times he shall be attentive) to the business of his\nteacher.\n\n25\\. And during the time for rest (he shall give) his mind (to doubtful\npassages of the lesson learnt).\n\n26\\. And he shall study after having been called by the teacher (and not\nrequest the teacher to begin the lesson). 26\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[18:1](sbe0208.htm#fr_186) **5**. Manu II, 164.\n\n[18:2](sbe0208.htm#fr_187) The meaning of the phrase, \'Study drives out the\nVeda, which has already been learnt from him who studies transgressing the\nrules prescribed for the student,\' is, \'The Veda recited at the Brahmaya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ a (daily study), and other religious rites, produces no effect, i.e. gains\nno merit for the reciter.\' Manu II, 97. Haradatta p. 19 gives also the\nfollowing three explanations of this Sutra, adopted by other commentators:--\n\n_a_. If these (rules) are transgressed, he loses his capacity for learning,\nbecause the Brahman forsakes him, &c.\n\n_b_. If these rules are transgressed, the capacity for learning and the\nBrahman leave him, &c.\n\nc. From him who studies whilst transgressing these rules, the Brahman goes\nout, &c.\n\n[19:4](sbe0208.htm#fr_188) \'Amongst the avaras means "amongst the men of\nmodern times, those who live in the Kaliyuga." No _Ri_ shis are born means\n"there are none who see (receive the revelation of) Mantras, Vedic texts."\'--\nHaradatta.\n\n[19:5](sbe0208.htm#fr_189) \'How is it then that men in our days, though they\ntransgress the rules prescribed for students, learn the four Vedas with little\ntrouble? (The answer is), By virtue of a residue of the reward (due) for the\nproper observance of those rules (of studentship) in a former Yuga. Therefore\n\xc3\x82pastamba says, Sutra 6 "But some," &c. New existence means "new birth\n(life)."\'--Haradatta.\n\n[19:6](sbe0208.htm#fr_190) An example of this (follows, Sutra 6): \'Like _S_\nvetaketu. For _S_ vetaketu learned the four Vedas in a short time; as we read\nin the _Kh_ andogya Upanishad (Prapa _th_ aka VI, 1).\'--Haradatta.\n\n[19:7](sbe0208.htm#fr_191) \'Whatever else besides the Veda, such as poison-\ncharms and the like,\'--Haradatta.\n\n[20:9](sbe0208.htm#fr_192) \'Acts to please the teacher are--washing his feet\nand the like; observance (of rules) conducive to welfare are--obedience to the\nprohibition to cross a river swimming, to eat pungent condiments, and\nobedience to the injunction to beg.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[20:10](sbe0208.htm#fr_193) \'Acts other than these, such as pilgrimages and\nthe like.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[20:11](sbe0208.htm#fr_194) \'What this "perfection" is has been declared in\nSutras 7, 8.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[20:12](sbe0208.htm#fr_195) Manu II, 122 and 124.\n\n[20:14](sbe0208.htm#fr_196) This salutation is to be performed only when the\noccasion requires it. The formerly-mentioned salutation (Sutras 12, 13) is to\nbe performed daily. In the next Sutra follows that by which the fulfilment of\na wish may be obtained.--Haradatta. Manu II, 121; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 26.\n\n[21:16](sbe0208.htm#fr_197) \'A Vai _s_ ya shall salute stretching forth his\narm on a level with his middle, i.e. the stomach; others say, on a level with\nhis thigh; the _S_ udra stretching it forth low, i.e. on a level with his\nfeet.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[21:17](sbe0208.htm#fr_198) See also Manu II, 225.\n\n[21:18](sbe0208.htm#fr_199) Manu II, 71.\n\n[21:22](sbe0208.htm#fr_200) Manu II, 72\n\n[21:23](sbe0208.htm#fr_201) Manu II, 191.\n\n[22:26](sbe0208.htm#fr_202) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 27; Manu II, 191.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na 1, Pa _t_ ala 2, Kha _n_ _d_ a 6](sbe0209.htm)\n\n'
