In the sick room the light in the small earthen cup\nflickered and went out, and the cool wind that comes with the first light\nentered the chamber and fanned with its wings both the watcher and the sick.\nIt was then, in those first rapt moments of sunrise, that there came, from far\noff by the Ganges side, the sound of the Indian flute, incredibly mysterious\nand remote, rising and falling in gentle cadences, pausing in sweetness,\nlingering in tenderness, dominated ever by its own pathos. The music was a\nhymn of worship, and the night just ended was the birthnight of Chaitanya--\nChaitanya, the saint of Nuddea, the poet and emancipator of Bengal. Oh\nwonderful birth at Nuddea, of the Lover of the People, on the People's Feast!\nFor this full-moon day of _Phalgun_ is not only the birthday of Gauranga, but\nalso the _Holi Puja_ of the low castes and the _Dol-jatra_ of the Hindu\ncalendar.\n\nWhatever else we do not know of the ancient countries, of one thing we may be\nsure, that in\n\np. 35\n\nevery case they must have had a yearly feast of Eros. We may gather, moreover,\nfrom the climatic and geographical associations of each land, the very moon of\nthe festival in every case. It must always have taken place in the spring-\ntime. The memory of this left behind, here a carnival, there a battle of\nflowers, and somewhere else a May Day frolic, to tell a future age the path it\nwent. Here in India, where all ages persist, like geological strata piled one\nupon another, it is kept to-day as it may have been in Assyria or Egypt, in\nearly Greece or in the empire of the Hittites.\n\nOn full-moon of the beautiful month of _Phalgun_ \\--that month when the\n_asoka_ tree and the mango are in bloom, when the foliage buds of the leaf-\nalmond are long and slender against the blue, and when the scarlet plumes of\nthe _palash_ stand out on its naked branches--occurs the _Holi_ festival, or\n_Dol-jatra_ of some long pre-Hindu people. Pre-Hindu they certainly were,\nalthough Hinduism has done its best to absorb and assimilate the poetry they\nbrought to it. For the _asoka_ tree, they say, only blooms when the footfall\nis heard by it of a beautiful woman, and the fragrance of mango-blossoms is\none of the five arrows of Madan's bow--two morsels of the folk-lore that\nclearly belong to the spring and nature festival. Madan, the Indian Love, is\nalways depicted as a young man, not as a child, who once upon a time\n\np. 36\n\nwent clad in flowers--nay, his very weapon was made of them. And as he wore it\nloose and unstrung beside his quiver, the eager bees hanging above it gave it\nits proper form of the bow. So at least we are told in Kalidas's immortal\nfragment. Wherever Madan is mentioned amongst the educated, Kalidas must needs\nbe remembered, for his was the brain that gave the beautiful young archer his\nlife-myth, and to his poem must all go who would learn of the impious faring\nforth together of Love and his comrade Spring, to shoot at the heart of the\nGreat God, and of the fate that befell their enterprise in the sacred grove of\nmeditation. All the love of the Indian soil and Indian nature that must have\nspoken in the wild poetic souls of the earliest aborigines is here poured,\ntogether with his own thought and learning, into the crucible of a great Hindu\npoet, to form the poem of the birth of Kartik the War-Lord. But long before\nKalidas took up his lute, the Indian feast of Eros had been Indianized, being\ninterpreted as an incident in the idyll of the sporting of the child Krishna\nin the meadows of Brindaban. Nothing is so exquisite as this--the tale of the\ndivine childhood as a cowherd amongst the herd-boys and herd-girls beside the\nJumna. At the age of eleven Krishna passes off the peasant stage for ever, but\nyears after, when his forest-friends visit him in his palace, they refuse to\n\np. 37\n\nrecognise their old playmate whom they now see in kingly robes, and will not\nbe satisfied till he has donned once more for them his childhood's crown of a\npeacock's feather, with flute and simple village garments, thus revealing\nhimself again to their adoring love as the same Gopala they knew of old.\n\nEveryone who knows anything of the village customs of the North-West has seen\nthe place that swinging holds in the Indian peasant's conception of a\nfestival. Boys and girls; young men and young women, like English rustics at a\nfair, swing and shout, applaud and deride each other, with never a suggestion\nof that dignity which we commonly associate with Oriental humanity. It is\nwonderful how easily, with a rope and a few bamboos and a wooden seat, a swing\ncan be made for a frolic. But in the Himalayas, near every temple, we find\nswing-posts of deodar and stout iron chains. Clearly there was a time when the\nfestival was celebrated everywhere, and since Brindaban must so obviously have\nknown the giddy delight, it followed that a swinging ceremony became part of\nthe religious ritual of the altar on the day of the Spring Feast. In other\nwords, Hinduism, by means of the Krishna legend, had absorbed into itself, and\nin doing so, lent a greater dignity of interpretation to, the Festival of Love\nof the country folk.\n\nHinduism absorbed, Hinduism reinterpreted,\n\np. 38\n\nbut she never criticised or discountenanced the gaiety of the child races. And\nstill the lower castes maintained the old practices of the season. There are\nperhaps two essential elements characteristic of the festivals of Madan. One\nis the free mixing of men and women, with probably a certain element of rough\nbuffoonery, something like the old St. Valentine's Day of Europe; and the\nother, the drawing together of all the classes, ignoring social differences of\nhigher civilisations of later ages. These two characteristics have persisted\nto the present day in the _Holi Puja_ observances of the Hindu lower classes,\nand Hindu gentlefolk of mature age will tell how in their childhood their\nmothers would bend the head to receive the red-powder _tilaka_ at the hands of\ntheir Hindustani servants.\n\nOut in the streets meanwhile the boys are at war with passing pedestrians, all\nof whom are bound on this privileged day to submit to being pelted with red\npowder. Yellow powders are sometimes used, but this, say the best judges, is a\nmistake. The red alone is correct, symbolising the sand of the Jumna, all\nstained with the blood of the demons, whom Krishna slew. The wild and\nboisterous, impatient of the priest's slow blessing, buy the powder straight\nfrom shops and throw it. But gentler spirits wait, playing only with that\nwhich is duly offered and sanctified in worship.\n\np. 39\n\n[paragraph continues] And great is the reward of their patience, for such is\nthe virtue of the blest powder that it confers immunity, it is said, from all\ndiseases of the season!\n\nHere then in India to this day is played out every year the old-time drama of\nthe peasant in the spring; played, too, in a fashion of which, however it may\nannoy the Philistine, neither the scholar nor the poet could bear to sacrifice\na single point. The joy of simple peoples in the bridal of nature, and the\nfestival of the great democracy of caste and sex--these are two impulses that\nhave given birth to all carnivals and _Holi Pujas_ that the world has ever\nknown. And behind, watching over them, suggesting a thought of poetry here, a\ntouch of sanctity there, and working to moderate possible excess only by her\nown benign presence and her kindly tolerance, stands the ancient Mother-Church\nof Hinduism. There was a wonderful dramatic fitness in the fact that in the\nfulness of time it was on the full-moon of _Phalgun_ , the day of the _Holi_\nfestival, that Chaitanya, apostle of rapture, lover of the poor and lowly, the\nnational saint and the preacher of democracy, was born here in Bengal.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Janmastami; The Day of the Great Birth](seh11.htm)\n\n"
