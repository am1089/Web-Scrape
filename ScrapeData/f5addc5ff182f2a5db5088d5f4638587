And on account of the non-extension (of the individual soul), there is no\nconfusion (of the results of actions).\n\nWell, let it be granted that injunctions and prohibitions, are valid, because\nthe Self although one is joined with particular bodies.--From the admission,\nhowever, of the unity of the Self it follows that there must be a confusion of\nthe fruits of actions, there being only one master (i.e. one soul to enjoy the\nfruits of action).--This is not so, we reply, because there is no extension of\nthe acting and enjoying Self, i.e. no connexion on its part with all bodies.\nFor, as we have shown, the individual soul depends on its adjuncts, and owing\nto the non-extension of those adjuncts there is also non-extension of the\nsoul.
