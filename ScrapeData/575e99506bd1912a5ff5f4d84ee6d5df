He who has had connection with a Guru's wife shall cut off his organ\ntogether with the testicles, take them into his joined hands and walk towards\nthe south without stopping, until he falls down dead. 1\n\n2\\. Or he may die embracing a heated metal image of a woman. 2\n\n3\\. A drinker of spirituous liquor shall drink exceedingly hot liquor so that\nhe dies. 3\n\n4\\. A thief shall go to the king with flying hair, carrying a club on his\nshoulder, and tell him his deed. He (the king) shall give him a blow with that\n(club). If the thief dies, his sin is expiated. 4\n\n5\\. If he is forgiven (by the king), the guilt falls upon him who forgives\nhim, 5\n\n6\\. Or he may throw himself into the fire, or perform repeatedly severe\nausterities, 6\n\n7\\. Or he may kill himself by diminishing daily his portion of food,\n\n8\\. Or he may perform K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penances (uninterruptedly) for one\nyear. 8\n\np. 83\n\n9\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 9\n\n10\\. Those who have committed a theft (of gold), drunk spirituous liquor, or\nhad connection with a Guru's wife, but not those who have slain a Brahma _n_\na, shall eat every fourth meal-time a little food, bathe at the times of the\nthree libations (morning, noon, and evening), passing the day standing and the\nnight sitting. After the lapse of three years they throw off their guilt.\n\n11\\. (A man of any caste) excepting the first, who has slain a man of the\nfirst caste, shall go on a battle-field and place himself (between the two\nhostile armies). There they shall kill him (and thereby he becomes pure). 11\n\n12\\. Or such a sinner may tear from his body and make the priest offer as a\nburnt-offering his hair, skin, flesh, and the rest, and then throw himself\ninto the fire. 12\n\n13\\. If a crow, a chameleon, a peacock, a Brahma _n_ i duck, a swan, the\nvulture called Bhasa, a frog, an ichneumon, a musk-rat, or a dog has been\nkilled, then the same penance as for a _S_ udra must be performed. 13\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[82:1](sbe0228.htm#fr_466) **25**. Haradatta's explanation of a 'Guru's wife'\nby 'mother' rests on a comparison of similar passages from other Sm _ri_ tis,\nwhere a different 'penance' is prescribed for incestuous intercourse with\nother near relations. Manu XI, 105; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. III, 259.\n\n[82:2](sbe0228.htm#fr_467) Manu XI, 104; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. III, 259.\n\n[82:3](sbe0228.htm#fr_468) Manu XI, 91, 92; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. III, 253.\n\n[82:4](sbe0228.htm#fr_469) I.e. who has stolen the gold of a Brahma _n_ a.\nManu VIII, 314, 316; XI, 99-101; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. III, 257.\n\n[82:5](sbe0228.htm#fr_470) Manu VIII, 317.\n\n[82:6](sbe0228.htm#fr_471) Manu XI, 102.\n\n[82:8](sbe0228.htm#fr_472) According to Haradatta this Sutra refers to all\nkinds of sins and it must be understood that the K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penances\nmust be heavy for great crimes, and lighter for smaller faults; see also\nbelow, I, 9, 27, 7 and 8.\n\n[83:9](sbe0228.htm#fr_473) Haradatta states that the verse is taken from a\nPura _n_ a.\n\n[83:11](sbe0228.htm#fr_474) Manu XI, 74; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. III, 248.\n\n[83:12](sbe0228.htm#fr_475) The Mantras given in the commentary, and a\nparallel passage of Vasish _th_ a XX, 25-26, show that this terrible penance\nis not altogether a mere theory of \xc3\x82pastamba. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. III, 247.\n\n[83:13](sbe0228.htm#fr_476) 'According to some, the penance must be performed\nif all these animals together have been slain; according to others, if only\none of them has been killed.'--Haradatta. Manu XI, 132, 136 Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. III,\n270-272.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Pa _t_ ala 9, Kha _n_ _d_ a 26](sbe0229.htm)\n\n"
