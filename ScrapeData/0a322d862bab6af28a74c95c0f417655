[1885], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n3:1:4\n\n### FOURTH BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n3:1:4:11\\. All formulas of the consecration are audgrabha _n_ a (elevatory),\nsince he who is consecrated elevates himself (ud-grabh) from this world to the\nworld of the gods. He elevates himself by means of these same formulas, and\ntherefore they say that all formulas of the consecration are 'audgrabha _n_\na.' Now they also (specially) designate these intermediate ones as 'audgrabha\n_n_ a,' because these are libations 1, and a libation is a sacrifice. For the\nmuttering of a sacrificial formula is an occult (form of sacrifice), but a\nlibation is a direct (form of) sacrifice: hence it is by this same sacrifice\nthat he elevates himself from this world to the world of the gods.\n\n3:1:4:22\\. And again, the three libations which he makes with the dipping-\nspoon (sruva) are said to be 'adhitaya _g_ us 2.' The fourth libation is made\nfor the sake of completeness; while the fifth, which is made with the\noffering-spoon (sru _k_ , viz. the _g_ uhu), is the real audgrabha _n_\na-libation: for he makes it with an\n\np. 21\n\nanush _t_ ubh verse, and the anush _t_ ubh is speech, and the sacrifice also\nis speech.\n\n3:1:4:33\\. By means of the sacrifice the gods obtained that supreme authority\nwhich they now wield. They spake, 'How may this (world) of ours be\nunattainable by men!' They then sipped the sap of the sacrifice, as bees would\nsuck out honey; and having drained the sacrifice and effaced its traces by\nmeans of the sacrificial stake, they disappeared: and because they effaced\n(scattered, yopaya) therewith, therefore it is called yupa (stake).\n\n3:1:4:44\\. Now this was heard by the _Ri_ shis. They collected the sacrifice,\njust as this sacrifice is collected (prepared) 1; for even so does he now\ncollect the sacrifice, when he offers those (audgrabha _n_ a) libations.\n\n3:1:4:55\\. He offers five libations, because the sacrifice is commensurate to\nthe year, and there are five seasons in the year: thus he gains it (the year)\nin five (divisions), and therefore he makes five libations.\n\n3:1:4:66\\. Now then of the oblation (Va _g_. S. IV, 7): 'To the Purpose, to\nthe Impulse, to Agni, hail!' At the outset he indeed purposes to sacrifice.\nWhat part of the sacrifice (is contained) in this (first libation), that he\nnow collects and makes his own.\n\n3:1:4:77\\. 'To Wisdom, to Thought, to Agni, hail!' with wisdom and thought he\nindeed conceives that he may sacrifice. What part of the sacrifice (is\ncontained) in this (second libation), that he now collects and makes his own.\n\n3:1:4:88\\. 'To Initiation, to Penance, to Agni, hail!' This is merely uttered,\nbut no libation is made.\n\np. 22\n\n3:1:4:99\\. 'To Sarasvati, to Pushan, to Agni, hail!' Now Sarasvati is speech,\nand the sacrifice also is speech. And Pushan represents cattle, because Pushan\nmeans prosperity (push _t_ i), and cattle also means prosperity, since the\nsacrifice means cattle. What part of the sacrifice (is contained) in this\n(third libation), that he now collects and makes his own.\n\n3:1:4:1010\\. As to this they say, 'These (three) libations are offered\nindefinitely; they are unestablished, without a god: therein is neither Indra,\nnor Soma, nor Agni.'\n\n3:1:4:1111\\. 'To the Purpose, to the Impulse, to Agni, hail!'--not any one\n(god we obtain) from this 1! But Agni surely is definite, Agni is established:\nwhen he offers in Agni (the fire), surely those (libations) are thereby made\ndefinite, are thereby established: for this reason he offers at all libations\nwith, 'To Agni, hail!' Moreover, these libations are called 'adhitaya _g_ u\n_m_ shi.'\n\n3:1:4:1212\\. 'To the Purpose, to the Impulse, to Agni, hail!' he says; for by\nhis own mind he purposes to sacrifice, and from his own mind he impels it (the\nsacrifice) when he performs it: these two deities the Purpose and the Impulse\n--are meditated upon (adhita) in his mind.\n\n3:1:4:1313\\. 'To Wisdom, to Thought, to Agni, hail!' he says; for with wisdom\nand thought he indeed conceives that he may sacrifice: these two deities--\n\np. 23\n\n[paragraph continues] Wisdom and Thought--are meditated upon in his mind.\n\n3:1:4:1414\\. 'To Sarasvati, to Pushan, to Agni, hail!' he says; for Sarasvati\nis speech, and the sacrifice also is speech: this deity--Speech--is meditated\nupon in his mind. Pushan, on the other hand, means cattle, for Pushan means\nprosperity (push _t_ i), and cattle means prosperity, since the sacrifice\nmeans cattle: hence cattle-are meditated upon in his mind. And because these\ndeities are meditated upon (a-dhita) in his mind, therefore (these libations)\nare called adhitaya _g_ u _m_ shi.\n\n3:1:4:1515\\. He then offers the fourth libation, with the text, 'Ye divine,\nvast, all-soothing Waters! Heaven and Earth, wide Ether! let us render homage\nunto B _ri_ haspati with offering, hail!' This (libation) truly is nearer to\nthe sacrifice, since he praises the waters, and water is sacrifice. 'Heaven\nand Earth! wide Ether!' he says, because he thereby praises the worlds. 'Let\nus render homage unto B _ri_ haspati, with offering, hail!' he says; for B\n_ri_ haspati is the Brahman, and the sacrifice also is the Brahman: for this\nreason also this (libation) is nearer to the sacrifice.\n\n3:1:4:1616\\. But the fifth libation which he makes with the offering-spoon\n(sru _k_ ), doubtless is the veritable sacrifice; for he offers it with an\nanush _t_ ubh (verse), and the anush _t_ ubh is speech and so is the\nsacrifice.\n\n3:1:4:1717\\. In the first place he pours the butter, which remains in the\ndhruva, into the _g_ uhu. He then ladles with the sruva three times butter\nfrom the melting-pot into the _g_ uhu: with what he takes the third time he\nfills the sruva 1.\n\np. 24\n\n3:1:4:1818\\. He offers, with the text (Va _g_. S. IV, 8; Rig-veda V, 50, I),\n'May every mortal espouse the friendship of the divine guide! every one\nprayeth for wealth: let him choose glory, that he may prosper, hail!'\n\n3:1:4:1919\\. Now this (verse and libation) consists of five parts in respect\nof deities 1: 'vi _s_ vo devasya' refers to the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_ ; 'netur'\nto Savit _ri_ ; 'marto vurita' to Mitra; 'dyumna _m_ v _ri_ _n_ ita' to B _ri_\nhaspati, since B _ri_ haspati means dyumna (glory); and 'pushyase' (for\nprospering) refers to Pushan.\n\n3:1:4:2020\\. This (libation), then, consists of five parts, in respect of\ndeities;--fivefold is the sacrifice, fivefold the animal victim, and five\nseasons there are in the year: the latter he accordingly gains by this\n(libation) consisting of five parts in respect of deities.\n\n3:1:4:2121\\. He offers this libation with an anush _t_ ubh verse, because the\nanush _t_ ubh is speech, and the sacrifice is speech; so that he thereby\nobtains the real sacrifice.\n\n3:1:4:2222\\. As to this they say, 'Let him offer only this one: for whatever\nobject the others are offered, that object he gains even by this one.' And,\nindeed 2, if\n\np. 25\n\nhe offers only this one, he would offer a full-offering; and the full means\neverything: hence he gains everything by this (oblation). And by filling the\ndipping-spoon (sruva), he fills the offering-spoon ( _g_ uhu), and the latter\nhe offers full. This, however, is a mere statement (of others' views)\n[1](sbe2607.htm#fn_75), but all (five) libations are offered.\n\n3:1:4:2323\\. He offers this one with an anush _t_ ubh verse. Being an anush\n_t_ ubh verse, it consists of thirty-one syllables. Now there are ten fingers,\nten toes, ten vital airs, and the thirty-first is the body wherein those vital\nairs are contained; for this much constitutes man, and the sacrifice is a man,\nthe sacrifice is of the same proportion as a man [2](sbe2607.htm#fn_76). Thus,\nwhatever the extent of the sacrifice, whatever its measure, to that extent he\ntakes possession of it by means of this (libation), when he offers it with an\nanush _t_ ubh verse of thirty-one syllables.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[20:1](sbe2606.htm#fr_68) While all the formulas of the Diksha are supposed to\nbe of an 'elevatory (audgrabha _n_ a)' character, the designation 'audgrabha\n_n_ ani (yagu _m_ shi, or elevatory formulas)' is specially applied to the\nfive libations described in the succeeding paragraphs. The Ka _n_ va text\nreads,--atha yad etany avantaram audgrabha _n_ anity akhyayanta ahutayo hy eta\nahutir by eva ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a _h_ paroksham iva hi tad yad ya _g_ ur _g_ apaty\netena hi tad ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ enodg _ri_ bh _n_ ite.\n\n[20:2](sbe2606.htm#fr_69) I.e. ya _g_ us for some 'meditated' object.\n\n[21:1](sbe2606.htm#fr_70) Sam-bh _ri_ ; on the technical meaning of this verb\n(to equip, prepare) and the noun sambhara, see part i, p. 276, note 1.\n\n[22:1](sbe2606.htm#fr_71) This last sentence has probably to be taken\nironically. In the Ka _n_ va text it seems to form part of the objection\nraised: Sa yat sarveshv agnaye svaheti _g_ uhoty anaddheva va eta ahutayo\nhuyante 'pratish _th_ ita iva na hi kasyai _k_ ana devatkyai huyante ||\nakutyai prayu _g_ a iti tan nagnir nendro na somo, medhayai manasa iti nato\n'nyatara _k_ _k_ anaivam eva sarveshv, agnir uva addha . . .\n\n[23:1](sbe2606.htm#fr_72) The third time he holds the sruva over the _g_ uhu\nand pours p. 24 ghee from the pot into the sruva, so as to fill it; after\nwhich he pours it from the sruva into the _g_ uhu. Katy. VII, 3, 18 comm.\n\n[24:1](sbe2606.htm#fr_73) The Taitt. S. (VI, 1, 2, 5) divides the couplet into\nits four padas, which it assigns to Savit _ri_ , the Fathers, the Vi _s_ ve\nDeva _h_ , and Pushan respectively. The various reading 'vi _s_ ve' of the\nBlack Ya _g_ us, instead of 'vi _s_ va _h_ ,' is very remarkable.\n\n[24:2](sbe2606.htm#fr_74) The author here states, in his own words, the\nreasons (by 'vai') which have led the teachers referred to to maintain that by\noffering this one oblation one gains all the objects in view. The Ka _n_ va\ntext includes the entire passage regarding the fivefold division of the\nformula and oblation (pars. 19-21) in the argument of those teachers. For a\ndetailed description of the pur _n_ ahuti, or full-offering, p. 25 see part i,\np. 302, note 2. A similar view, that the full-offering renders other oblations\nunnecessary, is there given (II, 2, 1, 5).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2, 1. Second Adhyaya. First Brahma _n_ a](sbe2607.htm)\n\n"
