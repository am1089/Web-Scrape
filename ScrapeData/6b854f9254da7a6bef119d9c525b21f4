[1885], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n4:2:1\n\n### SECOND ADHY\xc3\x82YA. FIRST BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n4:2:1:11\\. The _S_ ukra and Manthin (grahas), forsooth, are his eyes. Now the\n_S_ ukra, indeed, is he that burns yonder (the sun); and because it burns\nthere 3, therefore it is (called) _S_ ukra (\'bright\'). And the Manthin,\nindeed, is the moon.\n\n4:2:1:22\\. He mixes it with (barley) meal: thus he makes it to be gruel\n(mantha), whence it is (called) Manthin. Now those two (sun and moon);\nforsooth, are the eyes of these creatures; for were those two not to rise,\nthese (creatures) could not distinguish even their own hands.\n\n4:2:1:33\\. One of them is the eater, and the other the\n\np. 279\n\nfood 1; to wit, the _S_ ukra is the eater, and the Manthin the food.\n\n4:2:1:44\\. To one of them corresponds the eater, and to the other the food; to\nwit, the eater corresponds to the _S_ ukra, and the food to the Manthin. Now\nthese two (cups) are drawn for one (person) and offered to another. There are\ntwo Asura-Rakshas, _S_ a _n_ _d_ a and Marka: for them they are drawn; and to\ndeities they are offered. The reason for this is as follows.\n\n4:2:1:55\\. Now when the gods drove away the Asura-Rakshas, they could not\ndrive away these two; but whatever (sacrificial) work the gods performed, that\nthese two disturbed, and then quickly fled.\n\n4:2:1:66\\. The gods then said, \'Contrive ye how we shall drive away these\ntwo!\' They said, \'Let us draw two cups (of Soma juice) for them: they will\ncome down to us, and we shall seize them and drive them away.\' They\naccordingly drew two cups (of Soma) for them, and they both came down, and,\nhaving seized them, they (the gods) drove them away 2. This is why (the two\ncups) are drawn for _S_ a _n_ _d_ a and Marka, but are offered to deities.\n\n4:2:1:77\\. Also Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said, \'Should we not rather draw them for\nthe deities, since that is, as it were, the sign of conquest 3?\' In this,\nhowever, he merely speculated, but he did not practise it.\n\np. 280\n\n4:2:1:88\\. Now some make this the puroru _k_ formula of the _S_ ukra, \'He, the\nlonging, light-enveloped, urged the daughters of the dappled (cloud) along the\nmeasurer of the welkin,\'--saying, \'We thus make it like him that burns yonder,\nin that he says "the light-enveloped."\'\n\n4:2:1:99\\. But let him make this one the puroru _k_ formula of the _S_ ukra\n(Va _g_. S. VII, 12; Rig-veda V, 44, I), \'In the olden way, in the former way,\nin every way, in this way (drawest thou) supremacy from him, the barhis-\nseated, and the bliss-attaining,\'--for the eater corresponds to this ( _S_\nukra cup), and the eater is supreme hence he says, \'Supremacy from him, the\nbarhis-seated, bliss-attaining,\'--and onward strength drawest thou from him,\nthe roaring 1, the swift, that winneth those 2 through which thou waxest\nstrong.--Thou art taken with a support: thee for _S_ a _n_ _d_ a!\'--With \'This\nis thy womb: protect manhood!\' he deposits (the cup); for to this one\ncorresponds the eater, and the man (hero) is the eater: hence he says, \'This\nis thy womb: protect manhood!\' He deposits it on the south part (of the\nmount), for it is in that direction that yonder (sun) moves.\n\n4:2:1:1010\\. Thereupon he draws the Manthin with (Va _g_. S. VII, 16;\n\np. 281\n\n[paragraph continues] Rig-veda X, 123, 1), \'He, the longing 1, light-enveloped\n2, urged the daughters of the dappled 3 on the measurer of the welkin 4: him\nthe bards kiss like a child with songs at the union of the waters and the sun.\n--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Marka!\'\n\n4:2:1:1111\\. He mixes it with (barley) meal: the reason why he mixes it with\nmeal is this. Varu _n_ a once struck king Soma right in the eye, and it\nswelled (a _s_ vayat): therefrom a horse (a _s_ va) sprung; and because it\nsprung from a swelling, therefore it is called a _s_ va. A tear of his fell\ndown: therefrom the barley sprung; whence they say that the barley belongs to\nVaru _n_ a. Thus whatever part of his eye was injured on that occasion in\n(that part he now restores him and makes him whole by means of this (barley):\ntherefore he mixes (the libation) with meal.\n\n4:2:1:1212\\. He mixes it with (Va _g_. S. VII, 17; Rig-veda X, 61, 3), \'At\nwhichever offerings ye two, rushing swiftly as thought, accept with favour the\nsongs--he, the manly, who by the reeds of this (one) hath seasoned 5 in the\nhand the\n\np. 282\n\n[paragraph continues] (object of his) desire;\'--with \'This is thy womb:\nprotect the creatures!\' he deposits it (on the north part of the mound); for\nto this (graha) corresponds the food, and these creatures, the people, are\nfood: hence he says, \'This is thy womb: protect the creatures!\'\n\n4:2:1:1313\\. There are two sprinkled and two unsprinkled chips of the\nsacrificial stake 1: the Adhvaryu takes a sprinkled and an unsprinkled one;\nand in like manner the Pratiprasthat _ri_ takes a sprinkled and an unsprinkled\none. And the Adhvaryu takes the _S_ ukra, the Pratiprasthat _ri_ the Manthin.\n\n4:2:1:1414\\. The Adhvaryu cleanses (his cup) with the unsprinkled chip, with,\nSwept away is _S_ a _n_ _d_ a!\' In like manner the Pratiprasthat _ri_ with,\n\'Swept away is Marka!\' Thus even while drawing (the cups), they drive away the\ntwo Asura-Rakshas. With \'May the _S_ ukra-sipping gods lead thee forward!\' the\nAdhvaryu walks out (of the cart-shed); with \'May the Manthin-sipping gods lead\nthee forward!\' the Pratiprasthat _ri_ : thus they lead forward those two\n(libations) to the deities.\n\n4:2:1:1515\\. Behind the \xc3\x82havaniya fire they put their (right) elbows together,\nand deposit (the cups) on the high altar: the Adhvaryu on the right hip, and\nthe Pratiprasthat _ri_ on the left--without quitting their hold of them--with\n\'Unassailable art\n\np. 283\n\nthou!\' whereby they make the high altar unassailable by evil spirits; for they\nare about, in walking round it, to pass by the fire: hereby, then, they\npropitiate it, and so the fire does not injure them, while they walk round it\non different sides 1.\n\n4:2:1:1616\\. The Adhvaryu walks round it (on the north side) with (Va _g_. S.\nVII, 13), \'Abounding in heroes, producing heroes\'--for to this (libation)\ncorresponds the eater, and the hero is the eater: hence he says, \'Abounding in\nheroes, producing heroes!\'--\'encompass thou 2 the sacrificer with growth of\nwealth!\' By saying \'Encompass thou the sacrificer with growth of wealth!\' he\ninvokes a blessing upon the sacrificer.\n\n4:2:1:1717\\. And the Pratiprasthat _ri_ walks round (on the south side) with\n(Va _g_. S. VII, 18), \'Abounding in creatures, producing creatures\'--for to\nthis (libation) corresponds the food, and the creatures, the people, are the\nfood: hence he says, \'Abounding in creatures, producing\ncreatures,\'--\'encompass thou the sacrificer with growth of wealth!\' By saying\n\'Encompass thou the sacrificer with growth of wealth!\' he invokes a blessing\non the sacrificer.\n\n4:2:1:1818\\. They step out (from the altar) after closing the two (cups with\ntheir hands): thereby they make them invisible; whence no one sees yonder sun\nand moon when they go forward (eastwards). Having gone round to the front (of\nthe stake), they uncover (the cups), and offer them while standing in front:\nthereby they make them visible; whence every one\n\np. 284\n\nsees yonder sun and moon when they go backwards. Hence also no one sees the\nseed which is cast forwards, but every one sees what is produced backwards.\n\n4:2:1:1919\\. They put their elbows together behind the sacrificial stake,\nunless the fire should blaze up 1; but. if the fire blaze up, they may join\ntheir elbows in front of the stake,--the Adhvaryu with, \'The _S_ ukra\n(bright), uniting with the sky, with the earth, with the brightly shining;\'\nthe Pratiprasthat _ri_ with, \'The Manthin, uniting with the sky, with the\nearth, with the manthin-shining.\' Thus they make these two (cups) the resting-\nplaces of the eyes, and join the two eyes together: whence these two eyes are\njoined together with bones all round 2.\n\n4:2:1:2020\\. The Adhvaryu throws the unsprinkled stake-chip outside (the\naltar) with, \'Cast out is _S_ a _n_ _d_ a!\' and in like manner the\nPratiprasthat _ri_ with, \'Cast out is Marka!\' Thus they drive away the two\nAsura-Rakshas before the offerings.\n\n4:2:1:2121\\. Thereupon the Adhvaryu throws the sprinkled stake-chip on the\n\xc3\x82havaniya with, \'Thou art the abode of the _S_ ukra!\' and in like manner the\nPratiprasthat _ri_ with, \'Thou art the abode of the Manthin!\' These two\n(chips), forsooth, are the kindlers of the eyes,--he kindles the eyes\ntherewith; whence these eyes are kindled.\n\n4:2:1:2222\\. Thereon he mutters (Va _g_. S. VII, 14), \'May\n\np. 285\n\nwe be the preservers of thine unbroken manhood and prosperity, O divine Soma!\'\nThis is the benediction of that performance: he thereby invokes a blessing.\n\n4:2:1:2323\\. He then calls (on the Agnidh) for the _S_ rausha _t_ , and says,\n\'Urge thou for Indra the Soma-draughts brought forward, the pure, sweet-\nflowing, of the morrow\'s morning feast!\' As the Vasha _t_ is uttered, the\nAdhvaryu offers; then the Pratiprasthat _ri_ ; then the cup-bearers ( _k_\namasadhvaryu).\n\n4:2:1:2424\\. Those two offer while standing in front (of the fire); for these\ntwo (libations) are the eyes: thus they put those eyes in the front; and hence\nthese eyes are in the front.\n\n4:2:1:2525\\. They offer while standing on both sides of the stake; for what\nthe nose is, that is the sacrificial stake: hence these two eyes are on both\nsides of the nose.\n\n4:2:1:2626\\. Being consecrated by Vasha _t_ , these two (libations) are\noffered with a prayer. Now it is because the entire Savana is offered after\nthese two (libations) that they attain to this (distinction) 1; and the reason\nwhy the entire Savana is offered after them, is that they are most distinctly\nPra _g_ apati\'s own: for they are the eyes, and the eye is the truth, and Pra\n_g_ apati is the truth;--this is why the entire Savana is offered after them.\n\n4:2:1:2727\\. He offers with,\' This is the first consecration, assuring all\nboons: he is the first, Varu _n_ a,\n\np. 286\n\n[paragraph continues] Mitra, Agni;--he is the first, B _ri_ haspati, the wise:\nto that Indra offer ye the liquor, Hail 1!\'\n\n4:2:1:2828\\. Now when he offers with, \'This is the first--he is the first,\' it\nis just as with cast seed; for the eyes doubtless are formed first 2 hence he\noffers with, \'This is the first--he is the first\'\n\n4:2:1:2929\\. He then gives directions:--\'Let the Hot _ri_ \'s cup advance! let\nthe Brahman\'s, the Chanters\', the Sacrificer\'s (cups) advance! Ye cup-bearers\nof the fire-priests 3, approach and fill up (the cups) with pure Soma!\'--this\nis a composite direction. Having gone round (to behind the high altar) the\nPratiprasthat _ri_ pours his residue (of Soma) into the Adhvaryu\'s ( _S_ ukra)\nvessel; whereby he makes the food pay tribute to the eater. The Adhvaryu pours\nit into the Hot _ri_ \'s cup for drinking; because the draught belongs to the\nutterer of the Vasha _t_ ; for the Vasha _t_ is the breath, and that breath\nhas, as it were, departed from him while uttering the Vasha _t_. Now the\ndraught is breath: thus he puts that breath back into him.\n\n4:2:1:3030\\. And the reason why they do not take those\n\np. 287\n\ntwo (cups) behind 1, but do so take the other cups, is that those two are the\neyes. The residue (of Soma), then, he pours into the Hot _ri_ \'s cup.\n\n4:2:1:3131\\. They now fill up the cups of the fire-priests. For those residues\n2 are remains of oblations, insufficient for offering: he now fills them up\nagain, and thus they become sufficient for offering: therefore they fill up\nthe cups of the fire-priests.\n\n4:2:1:3232\\. Thereupon they make the fire-priests offer together 3. Now the\nfire-priests combined convey\n\np. 288\n\nthe sacrifice to the gods,--it is them he thereby satisfies together,\nthinking, \'Satisfied and pleased they shall convey the sacrifice to the gods;\'\ntherefore they make the fire-priests offer together.\n\n4:2:1:3333\\. When (the libation of) the first, or last [1](sbe2646.htm#fn_695)\nfire-priest has been offered, he addresses them (Va _g_. S. VII, 15), \'Let the\npriests\' offices be satisfied, they that have obtained a good sacrifice of\nsweet drink; they that are well-pleased, when they have obtained good offering\nwith Svaha!\' for this is the satisfaction of the priests\' (offices). Thereupon\nhe approaches (to the Hot _ri_ \'s hearth) and sits down with his face to the\nwest, with \'The Agnidh hath sacrificed!\' for on this occasion the Agnidh\nsacrifices last of those that sacrifice: hence he says, \'The Agnidh hath\nsacrificed.\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[278:3](sbe2645.htm#fr_674) This is how Saya _n_ a takes the passage: _s_\nukragrahas tapati _s_ o _k_ ati dipyata iti tasya _s_ ukranamadheyam. It is\ndoubtless the correct interpretation, though the pronouns \'esha\' and \'etad\'\nmight lead one to refer them to the sun.\n\n[279:1](sbe2645.htm#fr_675) The one that is to be eaten (adya _h_ ).\n\n[279:2](sbe2645.htm#fr_676) Muir, O. S. T. ii, p. 386, translates apa-han by\n\'to smite,\' which would seem to suit this passage much better than the\nordinary meaning \'to beat off, repulse, eject;\' but see paragraph\n[20](sbe2645.htm#4:2:1:20). The corresponding version of the legend in Taitt.\nS. VI, 4, 10 has \'apa-nud (to drive away).\'\n\n[279:3](sbe2645.htm#fr_677) Thus this passage is interpreted by Saya _n_ a,\nwho refers to Pa _n_. III, 3, 161 (sampra _s_ ne li\xe1\xb9\x85) and VIII, 2, 97 (vi _k_\naryama _n_ anam p. 280 pluta _h_ ). Possibly, however, \'no svid\' many have to\nbe separated from what follows: \'by no means! for deities we should draw\nthem,\' &c. The Ka _n_ va text reads, \'no svit khalu devatabhya eva g _ri_ h\n_n_ iyameti vidita _m_ hidam iti, tad u tan mima _m_ sam eva _k_ akre nety u\nta _k_ _k_ akara.\'\n\n[280:1](sbe2645.htm#fr_678) The Rig-veda reads \'gira (through song)\' instead\nof \'dhunim.\'\n\n[280:2](sbe2645.htm#fr_679) Viz. waters, juice, sap. Professor Ludwig supplies\n\'plants.\' This verse is extremely obscure.\n\n[281:1](sbe2645.htm#fr_680) Vena, according to Roth and Grassmann, refers to\nthe Gandharva, as the representative of the rainbow. This view is, however,\nrejected by Ludwig. The entire hymn is extremely and purposely obscure.\n\n[281:2](sbe2645.htm#fr_681) _G_ yotir- _g_ arayu, lit. \'having light for his\nchorion, or placenta.\'\n\n[281:3](sbe2645.htm#fr_682) P _ri_ _s_ nigarbha _h_ , lit. \'those who have the\ndappled (cloud) for their womb (or, are contained therein);\' apparently the\nrain-drops.\n\n[281:4](sbe2645.htm#fr_683) Ludwig identifies the measurer of the welkin with\nthe moon (Soma). Grassmann takes it in the sense of \'in measuring through the\nair.\'\n\n[281:5](sbe2645.htm#fr_684) The verse is manifestly corrupt. Professor Ludwig\nomits the accent in \'a _s_ ri _n_ ita,\' thus taking it out of the relative\nclause; but p. 282 even thus, no satisfactory sense, it seems to me, can be\nextracted from this line. When the Soma is mixed with milk or some other\nsubstance (as meal) two stalks of (ku _s_ a) reed-grass are laid on the cup,\nthe accessory substance being then poured through them. Katy. IX, 6, 9-10.\n\n[282:1](sbe2645.htm#fr_685) In paragraphs\n[13](sbe2645.htm#4:2:1:13)-[31](sbe2645.htm#4:2:1:31) the libations from the\n_S_ ukra and Manthin cups are anticipated. For their proper place in the\nactual performance, see note to [IV, 3, 1, 1](sbe2650.htm#4:3:1:1).\n\n[283:1](sbe2645.htm#fr_686) The Petersburg Dictionary takes \'vi-pari-i\' in the\nsense of to turn round.\' Cf. Katy. IX, 10, 8; \'vividha _m_ dakshi _n_ a\nuttarata _s_ _k_ a paribhogam ishyantau (!),\' Saya _n_ a.\n\n[283:2](sbe2645.htm#fr_687) Or, \'walk round to the sacrificer.\'\n\n[284:1](sbe2645.htm#fr_688) The sacrificial stake stands immediately in front\nof the high altar and fire. \'Yadi tato \'gnir nodbadheta,\' Ka _n_ va text.\n\n[284:2](sbe2645.htm#fr_689) That is, the cups represent the sockets of the\neyes, and the libations the eyes themselves. Perhaps, however, we ought to\ntranslate, \'whence these eyes are joined together (so as to be) on both sides\nof the bone,\' the sacrificial stake representing the bone or bridge of the\nnose. See [paragraph 25](sbe2645.htm#4:2:1:25).\n\n[285:1](sbe2645.htm#fr_690) \'And because these two (libations), having been\nconsecrated by Vasha _t_ , are offered with a mantra, therefore they attain\nthis (distinction) that the entire Savana is offered after them; and the\nreason why the entire Savana is offered after them, is that these two are its\neyes,\' &c.\n\n[286:1](sbe2645.htm#fr_691) Or, according to Mahidhara, \'To that Indra offer\nye the liquor with Svaha!\' The Pratiprasthat _ri_ makes his libation after the\nAdhvaryu. The Ka _n_ va texts read, \'When the Vasha _t_ has been uttered, the\nAdhvaryu offers, then the Pratiprasthat _ri_ ; then the others offer;\' and,\naccording to Katy. IX, II, 2, the _K_ amasadhvaryus make libations from the\ncups of the nine _K_ amasins (see note 2, next page) with, \'This to Indra\' at\nthe Vasha _t_ , and This to Agni\' at the Anu-vasha _t_. These libations are\nevidently referred to in paragraph [31](sbe2645.htm#4:2:1:31).\n\n[286:2](sbe2645.htm#fr_692) ? _S_ a _s_ vad dha vai retasa _h_ siktasya\nsambhavata _s_ _k_ akshushi eva prathame sambhavatas tasmad v eva _m_ _g_\napati; Ka _n_ va rec.\n\n[286:3](sbe2645.htm#fr_693) \'Sadasyana _m_ hotra _n_ am.\' The subordinate\npriests to whom the dhish _n_ yas (except that of the Hot _ri_ ) belong, both\nthose in the Sadas and the \xc3\x82gnidhra. See page [148](sbe2623.htm#page_148),\nnote [4](sbe2624.htm#fn_392).\n\n[287:1](sbe2645.htm#fr_694) That is, to the Sadas, for the priests to drink\nfrom.\n\n[287:2](sbe2645.htm#fr_695) Viz. the residues in the _k_ amasas of the\nHotrakas. The filling (by the Unnet _ri_ ) of the cups of the _K_ amasins--Hot\n_ri_ , Brahman, Udgat _ri_ , (and Sacrificer); Pra _s_ ast _ri_ , Brahma _n_ a\n_kh_ a _m_ sin, Pot _ri_ , Nesh _t_ _ri_ , and \xc3\x82gnidhra; that of the A _kh_\navaka remains empty for the present--takes place before the libations from the\n_S_ ukra and Manthin grahas. Their cups are filled by the Unnet _ri_ with\nSoma-juice from the Putabh _ri_ t, with an \'underlayer\' and final \'sprinkling\'\nor \'basting\' of \'pure\' Soma from the Dro _n_ akala _s_ a. Previous to the\nfilling, the Adhvaryu calls on the Maitravaru _n_ a to \'recite to (those cups)\nbeing drawn,\' the latter then reciting the hymn, Rig-veda I, 36, while the\ncups are filled. When the _S_ rausha _t_ is about to be pronounced by the\nAgnidh for the _S_ ukra and Manthin libations, the cup-bearers lift (udyam)\nthe cups, and, after the Pratiprasthat _ri_ has made his libation, they also\npour some Soma-juice into the fire. The cup-bearers of the first four _K_\namasins do so twice (and then take their cups back to the Sadas), the others\nonly once. Thereupon the cup-bearers of these last five--the so-called\nHotrakas, or subordinate Hot _ri_ s--are summoned again, and their cups having\nbeen filled up with \'pure\' Soma, the Adhvaryu makes, after the _S_ rausha _t_\n, two more libations from each at the Vasha _t_ and Anuvasha _t_ respectively.\nFor the offering-formulas and Anuvasha _t_ karas, see \xc3\x82 _s_ v. V, 5, 18-19.\nHolding the Agnidh\'s cup in his hand, he then goes to the Sadas and sits down\nfacing the Hot _ri_ , whereupon they drink together the Soma in the dvidevatya\ncups.\n\n[287:3](sbe2645.htm#fr_696) The phrase \'hotra _h_ (fem.) sa _m_ ya _g_ ayanti\'\nis apparently analogous to the \'patni _h_ sa _m_ ya _g_ ayanti\' [they perform\nthe Patnisa _m_ ya _g_ as, or, make the wives (of the gods) participate in the\nsacrifice] of the p. 288 Havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a. See part i, p. 256. Indeed\nMahidhara identifies the hotras with the metres of the offering-formulas, thus\ntreating them as a kind of deities.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 2, 2.
