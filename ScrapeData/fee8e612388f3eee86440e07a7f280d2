And when the day came for\nchoosing a name, they called him Prince Brahma-datta. He grew up in due\ncourse; and when he was sixteen years old, went to Takkasila, and became\naccomplished in all arts. And after his father died he ascended the throne,\nand ruled the kingdom with righteousness and equity. He gave judgments without\npartiality, hatred, ignorance, or fear. Since he thus reigned with justice,\nwith justice also his ministers administered the law. Law-suits being thus\ndecided with justice, there were none who brought false cases. And as these\nceased, the noise and tumult of litigation ceased in the king\'s court. Though\nthe judges sat all day in the court, they had to leave without any one coming\nfor justice. It came to this, that the Hall of Justice would have to be\nclosed!\n\nThen the future Buddha thought, "It cannot be from my reigning with\nrighteousness that none come for judgment; the bustle has ceased, and the Hall\nof Justice will have to be closed. I must, therefore, now examine into my own\nfaults; and if I find that anything is wrong in me, put that away, and\npractise only virtue."\n\nThenceforth he sought for some one to tell him his faults, but among those\naround him he found no one who would tell him of any fault, but heard only his\nown praise.\n\nThen he thought, "It is from fear of me that these men speak only good things,\nand not evil things," and he sought among those people who lived outside \'the\npalace. And finding no fault-finder there, he sought among those who lived\noutside the city, in the suburbs, at the four gates. And there too finding no\none to find fault, and hearing only his own praise, he determined to search\nthe country places.\n\nSo he made over the kingdom to his ministers, and mounted his chariot; and\ntaking only his charioteer, left the city in disguise. And searching the\ncountry through, up to the very boundary, he found no fault-finder, and heard\nonly of his own virtue; and so he turned back from the outermost boundary, and\nreturned by the high road towards the city.\n\nNow at that time the king of Kosala, Mallika by name, was also ruling his\nkingdom with righteousness; and when seeking for some fault in himself, he\nalso found no faultfinder in the palace, but only heard of his own virtue! So\nseeking in country places, he too came to that very spot. And these two came\nface to face in a low cart-track \'with precipitous sides, where there was no\nspace for a chariot to get out of the way!\n\nThen the charioteer of Mallika the king said to the charioteer of the king of\nBenares, "Take thy chariot out of the way!"\n\nBut he said, "Take thy chariot out of the way, O charioteer! In this chariot\nsitteth the lord over the kingdom of Benares, the great king Brahma-datta."\n\nYet the other replied, "In this chariot, O charioteer, sitteth the lord over\nthe kingdom of Kosala, the great king Mallika. Take thy carriage out of the\nway, and make room for the chariot of our king!"\n\nThen the charioteer of the king of Benares thought, "They say then that he too\nis a king! What _is_ now to be done?" After some consideration, be said to\nhimself, "I know a way. I\'ll find out how old he is, and then I\'ll let \'the\nchariot of the younger be got out of the way, and so make room for the elder."\n\nAnd when he had arrived at that conclusion, he asked that charioteer what the\nage of the king of Kosala was. But on inquiry he found that the ages of both\nwere equal. Then he inquired about the extent of his kingdom, and about his\narmy, and his wealth, and his renown, and about the country he lived in, and\nhis caste and tribe and family. And he found that both were lords of a kingdom\nthree hundred leagues in extent; and that in respect of army and wealth and\nrenown, and the countries in which they lived, and their caste and their tribe\nand their family, they were just on a par!\n\nThen he thought, "I will make way for the most righteous." And he asked, "What\nkind of righteousness has this king of yours."\n\nThen the charioteer of the king of Kosala, proclaiming his king\'s wickedness\nas goodness, uttered the First Stanza:\n\n"The strong he overthrows by strength,  \nThe mild by mildness, does Mallika;  \nThe good he conquers by goodness,  \nAnd the wicked by wickedness too.  \nSuch is the nature of _this_ king!  \nMove out of the way, O charioteer "\n\nBut the charioteer of the king of Benares asked him, "Well, have you told all\nthe virtues of your king?"\n\n"Yes," said the other.\n\n"If these are his _virtues,_ where are then his faults?" replied he.\n\nThe other said, "Well, for the nonce they shall be faults, if you like! But\npray, then, what is the kind of goodness your king has?"\n\nAnd then the charioteer of the king of Benares called unto him to hearken, and\nuttered the Second Stanza:\n\n"Anger he conquers by calmness,  \nAnd by goodness the wicked;  \nThe stingy he conquers by gifts,  \nAnd by truth the speaker of lies.  \nSuch is the nature of _this_ king!  \n\'Move out of the way, O charioteer!"\n\nAnd when he had thus spoken, both Mallika the king and his charioteer alighted\nfrom their chariot. And they took out the horses, and removed their chariot,\nand made way for the king of Benares!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pride Goeth Before a Fall](ift19.htm)\n\n'
