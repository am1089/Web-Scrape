Ask ye him. He has come. He knows. He the intelligent one moves forward;\nHe moves along (his way) (?) [1](sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:1:1). In him all\ncommands, all wishes dwell. He is the lord of strength, of mighty power.\n\n2\\. They ask him. He himself [1](sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:2:1) does not ask in\nturn what he, the wise one, has grasped by his own mind alone\n[2](sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:2:2). He does not forget the first word nor another\nword. Unconfused he adheres to his own power of mind.\n\n3\\. To him go the sacrificial ladles, to him go the racers\n[1](sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:3:1). He alone may hear all my words. He who\npronounces many praishas [2](sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:3:2), the conqueror, the\naccomplisher of sacrifices whose blessings are flawless, the young child has\nassumed vigour.\n\n4\\. When he has come together [1](sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:4:1) (with his\ncompanions [2](sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:4:2)), he goes to greet them\n[3](sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:4:3). As soon as born he steals upon (his prey)\ntogether with his companions. He strokes the \xe2\x80\xa6 [4](sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:4:4)\nto give him delight and joy, when the loving ones\n[5](sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:4:5) approach him who stands on them\n[6](sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:4:6).\n\n5\\. He, the animal living in the water and walking in the forest\n[1](sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:5:1), has been placed on the highest skin\n[2](sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:5:2) (sky?). He has proclaimed his rules to the\nmortals: for Agni, the knowing one, is intent upon _Ri_ ta (Right) and is\ntrue.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi. Metre, _G_ agati; the last verse is Trish _t_ ubh.--No\nverse occurs in the other Sa _m_ hitas.\n\np. 165\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. The Sa _m_ hita text has sa\xc2\xb4 nv\xcc\x83 iyate, the Pada text, sa _h_ nu\niyate. Comp. Prati _s_ akhya 314. I propose to read sa\xc2\xb4nu (= sa anu) iyate.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. See Geldner, Ved. Studien, II, p. 188.\n\nNote 2. Possibly we should read svena eva.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. The text (arvati _h_ ) implies that these race-horses are mares.\nProbably, as Saya _n_ a explains, the prayers (stutaya _h_ ) are alluded to.\nSee on the prayers compared with horses, Bergaigne, II, 284 seq.\n\nNote 2. Praisha is the technical designation of the sacrificial commands of\none priest (or more especially, of the Maitravaru _n_ a) to another priest;\ncomp. Schwab, Das Altindische Thieropfer, p. 90; H. O., Religion des Veda,\n390.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Sama\xc2\xb4rata may be the third person of singular or of plural.\n\nNote 2. I supply 'with his companions' in consideration of the second Pada (yu\n_g_ yebhi _h_ ). It is difficult to say who Agni's companions are (the flames?\nthe officiating priests?).\n\nNote 3. Ludwig's conjecture, upa sta\xc2\xb4yam _k_ arati, is very ingenious. 'He\nstealthily approaches them.'--On upastha\xc2\xb4yam, comp. also Bollensen,\nZeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl. Gesellschaft, XLVII, 586.\n\nNote 4. The meaning of _s_ vantam, which occurs here and in the obscure\npassage X, 61, 21 (adha ga\xc2\xb4va _h_ upamatim kana\xc2\xb4ya _h_ anu _s_ vantasya kasya\n_k_ it para iyu _h_ ), is unknown. Possibly it is related to _s_ vatra, which\nmeans something like 'powerful' or 'prosperous.'\n\np. 166\n\nNote 5. The prayers? The oblations?\n\nNote 6. Api-sthitam may have active or passive meaning, 'he who stands on\nsomebody or something,' and 'he on whom somebody or something stands.'\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. The first Pada (and probably also the fourth) belong to the metrical.\ntype described by H. O., Prolegomena, p. 68 seq.: the first part, before the\ncaesura, consists of four syllables; and then the Pada goes on as if it had\nthe pentasyllabic opening.\n\nNote 2. After Agni's abode in the Waters and in the wood has been mentioned in\nthe first Pada, the second Pada possibly refers to his heavenly abode to which\nthe adjective upama (highest') seems to point. Thus the 'highest skin' would\nbe the sky. But Saya _n_ a, who refers it to the Vedi, may possibly be right.\nHis explanation would very well agree with the second hemistich.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 146](sbe46044.htm)\n\n"
