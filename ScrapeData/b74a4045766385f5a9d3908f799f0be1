And (on account of the designation) (of the highest Self) as different\n(from the individual soul) in the states of deep sleep and departing.\n\np. 234\n\nIn the sixth prapa _th_ aka of the B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka there is given, in\nreply to the question, 'Who is that Self?' a lengthy exposition of the nature\nof the Self, 'He who is within the heart, among the pra _n_ as, the person of\nlight, consisting of knowledge' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 7). Here the doubt arises,\nwhether the passage merely aims at making an additional statement about the\nnature of the transmigrating soul (known already from other sources), or at\nestablishing the nature of the non-transmigrating Self.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that the passage is concerned with the nature of\nthe transmigrating soul, on account of the introductory and concluding\nstatements. For the introductory statement, 'He among the pra _n_ as who\nconsists of knowledge,' contains marks indicatory of the embodied soul, and so\nlikewise the concluding passage, 'And that great unborn Self is he who\nconsists of cognition,' &c. (IV, 4, 22). We must therefore adhere to the same\nsubject-matter in the intermediate passages also, and look on them as setting\nforth the same embodied Self, represented in its different states, viz. the\nwaking state, and so on.\n\nIn reply to this, we maintain that the passage aims only at giving information\nabout the highest Lord, not at making additional statements about the embodied\nsoul.--Why?--On account of the highest Lord being designated as different from\nthe embodied soul, in the states of deep sleep and of departing from the body.\nHis difference from the embodied soul in the state of deep sleep is declared\nin the following passage, 'This person embraced by the intelligent (pra _g\n\xc3\xb1_a) Self knows nothing that is without, nothing that is within.' Here the\nterm, 'the person,' must mean the embodied soul; for of him it is possible to\ndeny that he knows, because he, as being the knower, may know what is within\nand without. The 'intelligent Self,' on the other hand, is the highest Lord,\nbecause he is never dissociated from intelligence, i.e.--in his case--all-\nembracing knowledge.--Similarly, the passage treating of departure, i.e. death\n('this bodily Self mounted by the intelligent Self moves along groaning'),\nrefers to the highest Lord as different from the individual Self. There also\nwe have to understand by the 'embodied one' the individual\n\np. 235\n\nsoul which is the Lord of the body, while the 'intelligent one' is again the\nLord. We thus understand that 'on account of his being designated as something\ndifferent, in the states of deep sleep and departure,' the highest Lord forms\nthe subject of the passage.--With reference to the purvapakshin's assertion\nthat the entire chapter refers to the embodied Self, because indicatory marks\nof the latter are found in its beginning, middle, and end, we remark that in\nthe first place the introductory passage ('He among the pra _n_ as who\nconsists of cognition') does not aim at setting forth the character of the\ntransmigrating Self, but rather, while merely referring to the nature of the\ntransmigrating Self as something already known, aims at declaring its identity\nwith the highest Brahman; for it is manifest that the immediately subsequent\npassage, 'as if thinking, as if moving 1, 'aims at discarding the attributes\nof the transmigrating Self. The concluding passage again is analogous to the\ninitial one; for the words, 'And that great unborn Self is he who,' &c., mean:\nWe have shown that that same cognitional Self, which is observed among the pra\n_n_ as, is the great unborn Self, i.e. the highest Lord--He, again, who\nimagines that the passages intervening (between the two quoted) aim at setting\nforth the nature of the transmigrating Self by representing it in the waking\nstate, and so on, is like a man who setting out towards the east, wants to set\nout at the same time towards the west. For in representing the states of\nwaking, and so on, the passage does not aim at describing the soul as subject\nto different states or transmigration, but rather as free from all particular\nconditions and transmigration. This is evident from the circumstance that on\n_G_ anaka's question, which is repeated in every section, 'Speak on for the\nsake of emancipation,' Ya _g \xc3\xb1_avalkya replies each time, 'By all that he is\nnot affected, for that person is not attached to anything' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3,\n14-16). And later on he says (IV, 3, 22), 'He is not followed by\n\np. 236\n\ngood, not followed by evil, for he has then overcome all the sorrows of the\nheart.' We have, therefore, to conclude that the chapter exclusively aims at\nsetting forth the nature of the non-transmigrating Self.\n\n43\\. And on account of such words as Lord, &c.\n\nThat the chapter aims at setting forth the nature of the non-transmigrating\nSelf, we have to conclude from that circumstance also that there occur in it\nterms such as Lord and so on, intimating the nature of the non-transmigrating\nSelf, and others excluding the nature of the transmigrating Self. To the first\nclass belongs, for instance, 'He is the lord of all, the king of all things,\nthe protector of all things.' To the latter class belongs the passage, 'He\ndoes not become greater by good works, nor smaller by evil works.'--From all\nwhich we conclude that the chapter refers to the non-transmigrating highest\nLord.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[235:1](sbe34111.htm#fr_231) The stress lies here on the 'as if.' which\nintimate that the Self does not really think or move.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4, 1](sbe34112.htm)\n\n"
