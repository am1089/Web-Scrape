And as he walked along, the goblin on his\nshoulder said: "O King, I will tell you a strange story to relieve your\nweariness. Listen."\n\n\n\nThere once was a king in Ujjain, whose name was Virtue-banner. He had three\nprincesses as wives, and loved them dearly. One of them was named Crescent,\nthe second Star, and the third Moon. While the king lived happily with his\nwives, he conquered all his enemies, and was content.\n\nOne day at the time of the spring festival, the king went to the garden to\nplay with his three wives. There he looked at the flower-laden vines with\nblack rows of bees on them; they seemed like the bow of the god of love, all\nready for service. He heard the songs of nightingales in the trees; they\nsounded like commands of Love. And with his wives he drank wine which seemed\nlike Love\'s very life-blood.\n\nThen the king playfully pulled the hair of Queen Crescent, and a lotus-petal\nfell from her hair into her lap. And the queen was so delicate that it wounded\nher, and she screamed and fainted. And the king was distracted, but when\nservants sprinkled her with cool water and fanned her, she gradually recovered\nconsciousness. And the king took her to the palace and waited upon his dear\nwife with a hundred remedies which the physicians brought.\n\nAnd when the king saw that she was made comfortable for the night, he went to\nthe palace balcony with his second wife Star. Now while she slept on the\nking\'s breast, the moonbeams found their way through the window and fell upon\nher. And she awoke in a moment, and started up, crying "I am burned!" Then the\nking awoke and anxiously asked what the matter was, and he saw great blisters\non her body. When he asked her about it, Queen Star said: "The moonbeams that\nfell on me did it." And the king was distracted when he saw how she wept and\nsuffered. He called the servants and they made a couch of moist lotus-leaves,\nand dressed her wounds with damp sandal-paste.\n\nAt that moment the third queen, Moon, left her room to go to the king. And as\nshe moved through the noiseless night, she clearly heard in a distant part of\nthe palace the sound of pestles grinding grain. And she cried: "Oh, oh! It\nwill kill me!" She wrung her hands and sat down in agony in the hall. But her\nservants returned and led her to her room, where she took to her bed and wept.\nAnd when the servants asked what the matter was, she tearfully showed her\nhands with bruises on them, like two lilies with black bees clinging to them.\nSo they went and told the king. And he came in great distress, and asked his\ndear wife about it. She showed her hands and spoke, though she suffered: "My\ndear, when I heard the sound of the pestles, these bruises came." Then the\nking made them give her a cooling plaster of sandal-paste and other things.\n\nAnd the king thought: "One of them was wounded by a falling lotus-petal. The\nsecond was burned by the moonbeams. The third had her hands terribly bruised\nby the sound of pestles. I love them dearly, but alas! The very delicacy which\nis so great a virtue, is positively inconvenient."\n\nAnd he wandered about in the palace, and it seemed as if the night had three\nhundred hours. But in the morning the king and his skilful physicians took\nsuch measures that before long his wives were well and he was happy.\n\n\n\nWhen he had told this story, the goblin asked: "O King, which of them was the\nmost delicate?" And the king said: "The one who was bruised by the mere sound\nof the pestles, when nothing touched her. The other two who were wounded or\nblistered by actual contact with lotus-petals or moonbeams, are not equal to\nher."\n\nWhen the goblin heard this, he went back, and the king resolutely hastened to\ncatch him again.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Eleventh Goblin: The King who won a Fairy as his Wife.
