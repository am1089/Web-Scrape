(quoth the Vampire) during\nthe reign of the mighty Rupsen, flourished one Rajeshwar, a Rajput warrior of\ndistinguished fame. By his valour and conduct he had risen from the lowest\nranks of the army to command it as its captain. And arrived at that dignity,\nhe did not put a stop to all improvements, like other chiefs, who rejoice to\nrest and return thanks. On the contrary, he became such a reformer that, to\nsome extent, he remodelled the art of war.\n\nInstead of attending to rules and regulations, drawn up in their studies by\npandits and Brahmans, he consulted chiefly his own experience and judgment. He\nthrew aside the systematic plans of campaigns laid down in the Shastras or\nbooks of the ancients, and he acted upon the spur of the moment. He displayed\na skill in the choice of ground, in the use of light troops, and in securing\nhis own supplies whilst he cut off those of the enemy, which Kartikaya\nhimself, God of War, might have envied. Finding that the bows of his troops\nwere clumsy and slow to use, he had them all changed before compelled so to do\nby defeat; he also gave his attention to the sword handles, which cramped the\nmen\'s grasp but which having been used for eighteen hundred years were\nconsidered perfect weapons. And having organized a special corps of warriors\nusing fire arrows, he soon brought it to such perfection that, by using it\nagainst the elephants of his enemies, he gained many a campaign.\n\nOne instance of his superior judgment I am about to quote to thee, O Vikram,\nafter which I return to my tale; for thou art truly a warrior king, very\nlikely to imitate the innovations of the great general Rajeshwar.\n\n(A grunt from the monarch was the result of the Vampire\'s sneer.)\n\nHe found his master\'s armies recruited from Northern Hindustan, and officered\nby Kshatriya warriors, who grew great only because they grew old and--fat.\nThus the energy and talent of the younger men were wasted in troubles and\ndisorders; whilst the seniors were often so ancient that they could not mount\ntheir chargers unaided, nor, when they were mounted, could they see anything a\ndozen yards before them. But they had served in a certain obsolete campaign,\nand until Rajeshwar gave them pensions and dismissals, they claimed a right to\ntake first part in all campaigns present and future. The commander-in-chief\nrefused to use any captain who could not stand steady on his legs, or endure\nthe sun for a whole day. When a soldier distinguished himself in action, he\nraised him to the powers and privileges of the warrior caste. And whereas it\nhad been the habit to lavish circles and bars of silver and other metals upon\nall those who had joined in the war, whether they had sat behind a heap of\nsand or had been foremost to attack the foe, he broke through the pernicious\ncustom, and he rendered the honour valuable by conferring it only upon the\ndeserving. I need hardly say that, in an inordinately short space of time, his\narmy beat every king and general that opposed it.\n\nOne day the great commander-in-chief was seated in a certain room near the\nthreshold of his gate, when the voices of a number of people outside were\nheard. Rajeshwar asked, "Who is at the door, and what is the meaning of the\nnoise I hear?" The porter replied, "It is a fine thing your honour has asked.\nMany persons come sitting at the door of the rich for the purpose of obtaining\na livelihood and wealth. When they meet together they talk of various things:\nit is these very people who are now making this noise."\n\nRajeshwar, on hearing this, remained silent.\n\nIn the meantime a traveller, a Rajput, Birbal by name, hoping to obtain\nemployment, came from the southern quarter to the palace of the chief. The\nporter having listened to his story, made the circumstance known to his\nmaster, saying, "O chief! an armed man has arrived here, hoping to obtain\nemployment, and is standing at the door. If I receive a command he shall be\nbrought into your honour\'s presence."\n\n"Bring him in," cried the commander-in-chief.\n\nThe porter brought him in, and Rajeshwar inquired, "O Rajput, who and what art\nthou?"\n\nBirbal submitted that he was a person of distinguished fame for the use of\nweapons, and that his name for fidelity and velour had gone forth to the\nutmost ends of Bharat-Kandha.[83]\n\nThe chief was well accustomed to this style of self introduction, and its only\neffect upon his mind was a wish to shame the man by showing him that he had\nnot the least knowledge of weapons. He therefore bade him bare his blade and\nperform some feat.\n\nBirbal at once drew his good sword. Guessing the thoughts which were hovering\nabout the chief\'s mind, he put forth his left hand, extending the forefinger\nupwards, waved his blade like the arm of a demon round his head, and, with a\ndexterous stroke, so shaved off a bit of nail that it fell to the ground, and\nnot a drop of blood appeared upon the finger-tip.\n\n"Live for ever!" exclaimed Rajeshwar in admiration. He then addressed to the\nrecruit a few questions concerning the art of war, or rather concerning his\npeculiar views of it. To all of which Birbal answered with a spirit and a\njudgment which convinced the hearer that he was no common sworder.\n\nWhereupon Rajeshwar bore off the new man at arms to the palace of the king\nRupsen, and recommended that he should be engaged without delay.\n\nThe king, being a man of few words and many ideas, after hearing his\ncommander-in-chief, asked, "O Rajput, what shall I give thee for thy daily\nexpenditure?"\n\n"Give me a thousand ounces of gold daily," said Birbal, "and then I shall have\nwherewithal to live on."\n\n"Hast thou an army with thee?" exclaimed the king in the greatest\nastonishment.\n\n"I have not," responded the Rajput somewhat stiffly. "I have first, a wife;\nsecond, a son; third, a daughter; fourth, myself; there is no fifth person\nwith me."\n\nAll the people of the court on hearing this turned aside their heads to laugh,\nand even the women, who were peeping at the scene, covered their mouths with\ntheir veils. The Rajput was then dismissed the presence.\n\nIt is, however, noticeable amongst you humans, that the world often takes you\nat your own valuation. Set a high price upon yourselves, and each man shall\nsay to his neighbour, "In this man there must be something." Tell everyone\nthat you are brave, clever, generous, or even handsome, and after a time they\nwill begin to believe you. And when thus you have attained success, it will be\nharder to unconvince them than it was to convince them. Thus---\n\n"Listen not to him, sirrah," cried Raja Vikram to Dharma Dhwaj, the young\nprince, who had fallen a little way behind, and was giving ear attentively to\nthe Vampire\'s ethics. "Listen to him not. And tell me, villain, with these\nignoble principles of shine, what will become of modesty, humility, self-\nsacrifice, and a host of other Guna or good qualities which--which are good\nqualities?"\n\n"I know not," rejoined the Baital, "neither do I care. But my habitually\ninspiriting a succession of human bodies has taught me one fact. The wise man\nknows himself, and is, therefore, neither unduly humble nor elated, because he\nhad no more to do with making himself than with the cut of his cloak, or with\nthe fitness of his loin-cloth. But the fool either loses his head by comparing\nhimself with still greater fools, or is prostrated when he finds himself\ninferior to other and lesser fools. This shyness he calls modesty, humility,\nand so forth. Now, whenever entering a corpse, whether it be of man, woman, or\nchild, I feel peculiarly modest; I know that my tenement lately belonged to\nsome conceited ass. And--"\n\n"Wouldst thou have me bump thy back against the ground?" asked Raja Vikram\nangrily.\n\n(The Baital muttered some reply scarcely intelligible about his having this\ntime stumbled upon a metaphysical thread of ideas, and then continued his\nstory.)\n\nNow Rupsen, the king, began by inquiring of himself why the Rajput had rated\nhis services so highly. Then he reflected that if this recruit had asked so\nmuch money, it must have been for some reason which would afterwards become\napparent. Next, he hoped that if he gave him so much, his generosity might\nsome day turn out to his own advantage. Finally, with this idea in his mind,\nhe summoned Birbal and the steward of his household, and said to the latter,\n"Give this Rajput a thousand ounces of gold daily from our treasury."\n\nIt is related that Birbal made the best possible use of his wealth. He used\nevery morning to divide it into two portions, one of which was distributed to\nBrahmans and Parohitas.[84] Of the remaining moiety, having made two parts, he\ngave one as alms to pilgrims, to Bairagis or Vishnu\'s mendicants, and to\nSanyasis or worshippers of Shiva, whose bodies, smeared with ashes, were\nhardly covered with a narrow cotton cloth and a rope about their loins, and\nwhose heads of artificial hair, clotted like a rope, besieged his gate. With\nthe remaining fourth, having caused food to be prepared, he regaled the poor,\nwhile he himself and his family ate what was left. Every evening, arming\nhimself with sword and buckler, he took up his position as guard at the royal\nbedside, and walked round it all night sword in hand. If the king chanced to\nwake and asked who was present, Birbal immediately gave reply that "Birbal is\nhere; whatever command you give, that he will obey." And oftentimes Rupsen\ngave him unusual commands, for it is said, "To try thy servant, bid him do\nthings in season and out of season: if he obey thee willingly, know him to be\nuseful; if he reply, dismiss him at once. Thus is a servant tried, even as a\nwife by the poverty of her husband, and brethren and friends by asking their\naid."\n\nIn such manner, through desire of money, Birbal remained on guard all night;\nand whether eating, drinking, sleeping, sitting, going or wandering about,\nduring the twenty-four hours, he held his master in watchful remembrance.\nThis, indeed, is the custom; if a man sell another the latter is sold, but a\nservant by doing service sells himself, and when a man has become dependent,\nhow can he be happy? Certain it is that however intelligent, clever, or\nlearned a man may be, yet, while he is in his master\'s presence, he remains\nsilent as a dumb man, and struck with dread. Only while he is away from his\nlord can he be at ease. Hence, learned men say that to do service aright is\nharder than any religious study.\n\nOn one occasion it is related that there happened to be heard at night-time\nthe wailing of a woman in a neighbouring cemetery. The king on hearing it\ncalled out, "Who is in waiting?"\n\n"I am here," replied Birbal; "what command is there?"\n\n"Go," spoke the king, "to the place whence proceeds this sound of woman\'s\nwail, and having inquired the cause of her grief, return quickly."\n\nOn receiving this order the Rajput went to obey it; and the king, unseen by\nhim, and attired in a black dress, followed for the purpose of observing his\ncourage.\n\nPresently Birbal arrived at the cemetery. And what sees he there? A beautiful\nwoman of a light yellow colour, loaded with jewels from head to foot, holding\na horn in her right and a necklace in her left hand. Sometimes she danced,\nsometimes she jumped, and sometimes she ran about. There was not a tear in her\neye, but beating her head and making lamentable cries, she kept dashing\nherself on the ground.\n\nSeeing her condition, and not recognizing the goddess born of sea foam, and\nwhom all the host of heaven loved,[85] Birbal inquired, "Why art thou thus\nbeating thyself and crying out? Who art thou? And what grief is upon thee?"\n\n"I am the Royal-Luck," she replied.\n\n"For what reason," asked Birbal, "art thou weeping?"\n\nThe goddess then began to relate her position to the Rajput. She said, with\ntears, "In the king\'s palace Shudra (or low caste acts) are done, and hence\nmisfortune will certainly fall upon it, and I shall forsake it. After a month\nhas passed, the king, having endured excessive affliction, will die. In grief\nfor this, I weep. I have brought much happiness to the king\'s house, and hence\nI am full of regret that this my prediction cannot in any way prove untrue."\n\n"Is there," asked Birbal, "any remedy for this trouble, so that the king may\nbe preserved and live a hundred years?"\n\n"Yes," said the goddess, "there is. About eight miles to the east thou wilt\nfind a temple dedicated to my terrible sister Devi. Offer to her thy son\'s\nhead, cut off with shine own hand, and the reign of thy king shall endure for\nan age." So saying Raj-Lakshmi disappeared.\n\nBirbal answered not a word, but with hurried steps he turned towards his home.\nThe king, still in black so as not to be seen, followed him closely, and\nobserved and listened to everything he did.\n\nThe Rajput went straight to his wife, awakened her, and related to her\neverything that had happened. The wise have said, "she alone deserves the name\nof wife who always receives her husband with affectionate and submissive\nwords." When she heard the circumstances, she at once aroused her son, and her\ndaughter also awoke. Then Birbal told them all that they must follow him to\nthe temple of Devi in the wood.\n\nOn the way the Rajput said to his wife, "If thou wilt give up thy son\nwillingly, I will sacrifice him for our master\'s sake to Devi the Destroyer."\n\nShe replied, "Father and mother, son and daughter, brother and relative, have\nI now none. You are everything to me. It is written in the scripture that a\nwife is not made pure by gifts to priests, nor by performing religious rites;\nher virtue consists in waiting upon her husband, in obeying him and in loving\nhim--yea! though he be lame, maimed in the hands, dumb, deaf, blind, one eyed,\nleprous, or humpbacked. It is a true saying that \'a son under one\'s authority,\na body free from sickness, a desire to acquire knowledge, an intelligent\nfriend, and an obedient wife; whoever holds these five will find them\nbestowers of happiness and dispellers of affliction. An unwilling servant, a\nparsimonious king, an insincere friend, and a wife not under control; such\nthings are disturbers of ease and givers of trouble.\'"\n\nThen the good wife turned to her son and said "Child by the gift of thy head,\nthe king\'s life may be spared, and the kingdom remain unshaken."\n\n"Mother," replied that excellent youth, "in my opinion we should hasten this\nmatter. Firstly, I must obey your command; secondly, I must promote the\ninterests of my master; thirdly, if this body be of any use to a goddess,\nnothing better can be done with it in this world."\n\n("Excuse me, Raja Vikram," said the Baital, interrupting himself, "if I repeat\nthese fair discourses at full length; it is interesting to hear a young\nperson, whose throat is about to be cut, talk so like a doctor of laws.")\n\nThen the youth thus addressed his sire: "Father, whoever can be of use to his\nmaster, the life of that man in this world has been lived to good purpose, and\nby reason of his usefulness he will be rewarded in other worlds."\n\nHis sister, however, exclaimed, "If a mother should give poison to her\ndaughter, and a father sell his son, and a king seize the entire property of\nhis subjects, where then could one look for protection?" But they heeded her\nnot, and continued talking as they journeyed towards the temple of Devi--the\nking all the while secretly following them.\n\nPresently they reached the temple, a single room, surrounded by a spacious\npaved area; in front was an immense building capable of seating hundreds of\npeople. Before the image there were pools of blood, where victims had lately\nbeen slaughtered. In the sanctum was Devi, a large black figure with ten arms.\nWith a spear in one of her right hands she pierced the giant Mahisha; and with\none of her left hands she held the tail of a serpent, and the hair of the\ngiant, whose breast the serpent was biting. Her other arms were all raised\nabove her head, and were filled with different instruments of war; against her\nright leg leaned a lion.\n\nThen Birbal joined his hands in prayer, and with Hindu mildness thus addressed\nthe awful goddess: "O mother, let the king\'s life be prolonged for a thousand\nyears by the sacrifice of my son. O Devi, mother! destroy, destroy his\nenemies! Kill! kill! Reduce them to ashes! Drive them away! Devour them!\ndevour them! Cut them in two! Drink! drink their blood! Destroy them root and\nbranch! With thy thunderbolt, spear, scymitar, discus, or rope, annihilate\nthem! Spheng! Spheng!"\n\nThe Rajput, having caused his son to kneel before the goddess, struck him so\nviolent a blow that his head rolled upon the ground. He then threw the sword\ndown, when his daughter, frantic with grief, snatched it up and struck her\nneck with such force that her head, separated from her body, fell. In her turn\nthe mother, unable to survive the loss of her children, seized the weapon and\nsucceeded in decapitating herself. Birbal, beholding all this slaughter, thus\nreflected: "My children are dead why, now, should I remain in servitude, and\nupon whom shall I bestow the gold I receive from the king?" He then gave\nhimself so deep a wound in the neck, that his head also separated from his\nbody.\n\nRupsen, the king, seeing these four heads on the ground, said in his heart,\n"For my sake has the family of Birbal been destroyed. Kingly power, for the\npurpose of upholding which the destruction of a whole household is necessary,\nis a mere curse, and to carry on government in this manner is not just." He\nthen took up the sword and was about to slay himself, when the Destroying\nGoddess, probably satisfied with bloodshed, stayed his hand, bidding him at\nthe same time ask any boon he pleased.\n\nThe generous monarch begged, thereupon, that his faithful servant might be\nrestored to life, together with all his high-minded family; and the goddess\nDevi in the twinkling of an eye fetched from Patala, the regions below the\nearth, a vase full of Amrita, the water of immortality, sprinkled it upon the\ndead, and raised them all as before. After which the whole party walked\nleisurely home, and in due time the king divided his throne with his friend\nBirbal.\n\nHaving stopped for a moment, the Baital proceeded to remark, in a sententious\ntone, "Happy the servant who grudges not his own life to save that of his\nmaster! And happy, thrice happy the master who can annihilate all greedy\nlonging for existence and worldly prosperity. Raja, I have to ask thee one\nsearching question--Of these five, who was the greatest fool?"\n\n"Demon!" exclaimed the great Vikram, all whose cherished feelings about\nfidelity and family affection, obedience, and high-mindedness, were outraged\nby this Vampire view of the question; "if thou meanest by the greatest fool\nthe noblest mind, I reply without hesitating Rupsen, the king."\n\n"Why, prithee?" asked the Baital.\n\n"Because, dull demon," said the king, "Birbal was bound to offer up his life\nfor a master who treated him so generously; the son could not disobey his\nfather, and the women naturally and instinctively killed themselves, because\nthe example was set to them. But Rupsen the king gave up his throne for the\nsake of his retainer, and valued not a straw his life and his high inducements\nto live. For this reason I think him the most meritorious."\n\n"Surely, mighty Vikram," laughed the Vampire, "you will be tired of ever\nclambering up yon tall tree, even had you the legs and arms of Hanuman[86]\nhimself."\n\nAnd so saying he disappeared from the cloth, although it had been placed upon\nthe ground.\n\nBut the poor Baital had little reason to congratulate himself on the success\nof his escape. In a short time he was again bundled into the cloth with the\nusual want of ceremony, and he revenged himself by telling another true story.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Vampire\'s Fourth Story.
