Charm to secure the superiority of a king.\n\n1\\. This warrior, O Indra, do thou strengthen for me, do thou install this one\nas sole ruler (bull) of the Vis (the people); emasculate all his enemies,\nsubject them to him in (their) contests!  \n2\\. To him apportion his share of villages, horses, and cattle; deprive of his\nshare the one that is his enemy! May this king be the pinnacle of royalty;\nsubject to him, O Indra, every enemy!  \n3\\. May this one be the treasure-lord of riches, may this king be the tribal\nlord of the Vis (the people)! Upon this one, O Indra, bestow great lustre,\ndevoid of lustre render his enemy!  \n4\\. For him shall ye, O heaven and earth, milk ample good, as two milch-cows\nyielding warm milk! May this king be favoured of Indra, favoured of cows, of\nplants, and cattle!  \n5\\. I unite with thee Indra who has supremacy, through whom one conquers and\nis not (himself) conquered, who shall install thee as sole ruler of the\npeople, and as chief of the human kings.  \n6\\. Superior art thou, inferior are thy rivals, and whatsoever adversaries are\nthine, O king! Sole ruler, befriended of Indra, victorious, bring thou hither\nthe supplies of those who act as thy enemies!  \n7\\. Presenting the front of a lion do thou devour all (their) people,\npresenting the front of a tiger do thou strike down the enemies! Sole ruler,\nbefriended of Indra, victorious, seize upon the supplies of those who act as\nthy enemies!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 9. Prayer for earthly and heavenly success](av140.htm)\n\n'
