This date,\napproximate as it is, must yet be given with considerable hesitation, and is\nby no means certain. No truly biographical data are preserved about the\nauthor, who nevertheless enjoyed a great popularity during his life, and whom\nthe Hindus have ever regarded as the greatest of Sanskrit poets. We are thus\nconfronted with one of the remarkable problems of literary history. For our\nignorance is not due to neglect of Kalidasa\'s writings on the part of his\ncountrymen, but to their strange blindness in regard to the interest and\nimportance of historic fact. No European nation can compare with India in\ncritical devotion to its own literature. During a period to be reckoned not by\ncenturies but by millenniums, there has been in India an unbroken line of\nsavants unselfishly dedicated to the perpetuation and exegesis of the native\nmasterpieces. Editions, recensions, commentaries abound; poets have sought the\nexact phrase of appreciation for their predecessors: yet when we seek to\nreconstruct the life of their greatest poet, we have no materials except\ncertain tantalising legends, and such data as we can gather from the writings\nof a man who hardly mentions himself.\n\nOne of these legends deserves to be recounted for its intrinsic interest,\nalthough it contains, so far as we can see, no grain of historic truth, and\nalthough it places Kalidasa in Benares, five hundred miles distant from the\nonly city in which we certainly know that he spent a part of his life.\nAccording to this account, Kalidasa was a Brahman\'s child. At the age of six\nmonths he was left an orphan and was adopted by an ox-driver. He grew to\nmanhood\n\np. viii\n\nwithout formal education, yet with remarkable beauty and grace of manner. Now\nit happened that the Princess of Benares was a blue-stocking, who rejected one\nsuitor  after another, among them her father\'s counsellor, because they failed\nto reach her standard as scholars and poets. The rejected counsellor planned a\ncruel revenge. He took the handsome ox-driver from the street, gave him the\ngarments of a savant and a retinue of learned doctors, then introduced him to\nthe princess, after warning him that he was under no circumstances to open his\nlips. The princess was struck with his beauty and smitten to the depths of her\npedantic soul by his obstinate silence, which seemed to her, as indeed it was,\nan evidence of profound wisdom. She desired to marry Kalidasa, and together\nthey went to the temple. But no sooner was the ceremony performed than\nKalidasa perceived an image of a bull. His early training was too much for\nhim; the secret came out, and the bride was furious. But she relented in\nresponse to Kalidasa\'s entreaties, and advised him to pray for learning and\npoetry to the goddess Kali. The prayer was granted; education and poetical\npower descended miraculously to dwell with the young ox-driver, who in\ngratitude assumed the name Kalidasa, servant of Kali. Feeling that he owed\nthis happy change in his very nature to his princess, he swore that he would\never treat her as his teacher, with profound respect but without familiarity.\nThis was more than the lady had bargained for; her anger burst forth anew, and\nshe cursed Kalidasa to meet his death at the hands of a woman. At a later\ndate, the story continues, this curse was fulfilled. A certain king had\nwritten a half-stanza of verse, and had offered a large reward to any poet who\ncould worthily complete it. Kalidasa completed the stanza without difficulty;\nbut a woman whom he loved discovered his lines, and greedy of the reward\nherself, killed him.\n\nAnother legend represents Kalidasa as engaging in a pilgrimage to a shrine of\nVishnu in Southern India, in company with two other famous writers, Bhavabhuti\nand Dandin. Yet another pictures Bhavabhuti as a contemporary of Kalidasa, and\njealous of the less austere poet\'s reputation. These stories must be untrue,\nfor it is\n\np. ix\n\ncertain that the three authors were not contemporary, yet they show a true\ninstinct in the belief that genius seeks genius, and is rarely isolated.\n\nThis instinctive belief has been at work with the stories which connect\nKalidasa with King Vikramaditya and the literary figures of his court. It has\ndoubtless enlarged, perhaps partly falsified the facts; yet we cannot doubt\nthat there is truth in this tradition, late though it be, and impossible\nthough it may ever be to separate the actual from the fanciful. Here then we\nare on firmer ground. King Vikramaditya ruled in the city of Ujjain, in West-\ncentral India. He was mighty both in war and in peace, winning especial glory\nby a decisive victory over the barbarians who pressed into India through the\nnorthern passes. Though it has not proved possible to identify this monarch\nwith any of the known rulers, there can be no doubt that he existed and had\nthe character attributed to him. The name Vikramaditya--Sun of Valour--is\nprobably not a proper name, but a title like Pharaoh or Tsar. No doubt\nKalidasa intended to pay a tribute to his patron, the Sun of Valour, in the\nvery title of his play, _Urvashi won by Valour_.\n\nKing Vikramaditya was a great patron of learning and of poetry. Ujjain during\nhis reign was the most brilliant capital in the world, nor has it to this day\nlost all the lustre shed upon it by that splendid court. Among the eminent men\ngathered there, nine were particularly distinguished, and these nine are known\nas the "nine gems." Some of the nine gems were poets, others represented\nscience--astronomy, medicine, lexicography. It is quite true that the details\nof this late tradition concerning the nine gems are open to suspicion, yet the\ncentral fact is not doubtful: that there was at this time and place a great\nquickening of the human mind, an artistic impulse creating works that cannot\nperish. Ujjain in the days of Vikramaditya stands worthily beside Athens,\nRome, Florence, and London in their great centuries. Here is the substantial\nfact behind Max Muller\'s often ridiculed theory of the renaissance of Sanskrit\nliterature. It is quite false to suppose, as some appear to do, that this\ntheory has been invalidated by the discovery of certain literary products\n\np. x\n\nwhich antedate Kalidasa. It might even be said that those rare and happy\ncenturies that see a man as great as Homer or Vergil or Kalidasa or\nShakespeare partake in that one man of a renaissance.\n\nIt is interesting to observe that the centuries of intellectual darkness in\nEurope have sometimes coincided with centuries of light in India. The Vedas\nwere composed for the most part before Homer; Kalidasa and his contemporaries\nlived while Rome was tottering under barbarian assault.\n\nTo the scanty and uncertain data of late traditions may be added some\ninformation about Kalidasa\'s life gathered from his own writings. He mentions\nhis own name only in the prologues to his three plays, and here with a modesty\nthat is charming indeed, yet tantalising. One wishes for a portion of the\ncommunicativeness that characterises  some of the Indian poets. He speaks in\nthe first person only once, in the verses introductory to his epic poem _The\nDynasty of Raghu_. 1 Here also we feel his modesty, and here once more we are\nbalked of details as to his life.\n\nWe know from Kalidasa\'s writings that he spent at least a part of his life in\nthe city of Ujjain. He refers to Ujjain more than once, and in a manner hardly\npossible to one who did not know and love the city. Especially in his poem\n_The Cloud-Messenger_ does he dwell upon the city\'s charms, and even bids the\ncloud make a detour in his long journey lest he should miss making its\nacquaintance. 2\n\nWe learn further that Kalidasa travelled widely in India. The fourth canto of\n_The Dynasty of Raghu_ describes a tour about the whole of India and even into\nregions which are beyond the borders of a narrowly measured India. It is hard\nto believe that Kalidasa had not himself made such a "grand tour"; so much of\ntruth there may be in the tradition which sends him on a pilgrimage to\nSouthern India. The thirteenth canto of the same epic and _The Cloud-\nMessenger_ also describe long journeys over India, for the most part through\nregions far from Ujjain. It is the mountains which impress him most deeply.\nHis works are full of the Himalayas. Apart from his earliest\n\np. xi\n\ndrama and the slight poem called _The Seasons_ , there is not one of them\nwhich is not fairly redolent of mountains. One, _The Birth of the War-god_ ,\nmight be said to be all mountains. Nor was it only Himalayan grandeur and\nsublimity which attracted him; for, as a Hindu critic has acutely observed, he\nis the only Sanskrit poet who has described a certain flower that grows in\nKashmir. The sea interested him less. To him, as to most Hindus, the ocean was\na beautiful, terrible barrier, not a highway to adventure. The "sea-belted\nearth" of which Kalidasa speaks means to him the mainland of India.\n\nAnother conclusion that may be certainly drawn from Kalidasa\'s writing is\nthis, that he was a man of sound and rather extensive education. He was not\nindeed a prodigy of learning, like Bhavabhuti in his own country or Milton in\nEngland, yet no man could write as he did without hard and intelligent study.\nTo begin with, he had a minutely accurate knowledge of the Sanskrit language,\nat a time when Sanskrit was to some extent an artificial tongue. Somewhat too\nmuch stress is often laid upon this point, as if the writers of the classical\nperiod in India were composing in a foreign language. Every writer, especially\nevery poet, composing in any language, writes in what may be called a strange\nidiom; that is, he does not write as he talks. Yet it is true that the gap\nbetween written language and vernacular was wider in Kalidasa\'s day than it\nhas often been. The Hindus themselves regard twelve years\' study as requisite\nfor the mastery of the "chief of all sciences, the science of grammar." That\nKalidasa had mastered this science his works bear abundant witness.\n\nHe likewise mastered the works on rhetoric and dramatic theory--subjects which\nHindu savants have treated with great, if sometimes hair-splitting, ingenuity.\nThe profound and subtle systems of philosophy were also possessed by Kalidasa,\nand he had some knowledge of astronomy and law.\n\nBut it was not only in written books that Kalidasa was deeply read. Rarely has\na man walked our earth who observed the phenomena of living nature as\naccurately as he, though his accuracy was of course that of the poet, not that\nof the scientist. Much is lost to us who grow up\n\np. xii\n\namong other animals and plants; yet we can appreciate his "bee-black hair,"\nhis ashoka-tree that "sheds his blossoms in a rain of tears," his river\nwearing a sombre veil of mist:\n\nAlthough her reeds seem hands that clutch the dress  \nTo hide her charms;\n\nhis picture of the day-blooming water-lily at sunset:\n\nThe water-lily closes, but  \nWith wonderful reluctancy;  \nAs if it troubled her to shut  \nHer door of welcome to the bee.\n\nThe religion of any great poet is always a matter of interest, especially the\nreligion of a Hindu poet; for the Hindus have ever been a deeply and\ncreatively religious people. So far as we can judge, Kalidasa moved among the\njarring sects with sympathy for all, fanaticism for none. The dedicatory\nprayers that introduce his dramas are addressed to Shiva. This is hardly more\nthan a convention, for Shiva is the patron of literature. If one of his epics,\n_The Birth of the War-god_ , is distinctively Shivaistic, the other, _The\nDynasty of Raghu_ , is no less Vishnuite in tendency. If the hymn to Vishnu in\n_The Dynasty of Raghu_ is an expression of Vedantic monism, the hymn to Brahma\nin _The Birth of the War-god_ gives equally clear expression to the rival\ndualism of the Sankhya system. Nor are the Yoga doctrine and Buddhism left\nwithout sympathetic mention. We are therefore justified in concluding that\nKalidasa was, in matters of religion, what William James would call "healthy-\nminded," emphatically not a "sick soul."\n\nThere are certain other impressions of Kalidasa\'s life and personality which\ngradually become convictions in the mind of one who reads and re-reads his\npoetry, though they are less easily susceptible of exact proof. One feels\ncertain that he was physically handsome, and the handsome Hindu is a\nwonderfully fine type of manhood. One knows that he possessed a fascination\nfor women, as they in turn fascinated him. One knows that children loved him.\nOne becomes convinced that he never suffered any morbid, soul-shaking\nexperience such as besetting religious\n\np. xiii\n\ndoubt brings with it, or the pangs of despised love; that on the contrary he\nmoved among men and women with a serene and godlike tread, neither self-\nindulgent nor ascetic, with mind and senses ever alert to every form of\nbeauty. We know that his poetry was popular while he lived, and we cannot\ndoubt that his personality was equally attractive, though it is probable that\nno contemporary knew the full measure of his greatness. For his nature was one\nof singular balance, equally at home in a splendid court and on a lonely\nmountain, with men of high and of low degree. Such men are never fully\nappreciated during life. They continue to grow after they are dead.\n\n### II\n\nKalidasa left seven works which have come down to us: three dramas, two epics,\none elegiac poem, and one descriptive poem. Many other works, including even\nan astronomical treatise, have been attributed to him; they are certainly not\nhis. Perhaps there was more than one author who bore the name Kalidasa;\nperhaps certain later writers were more concerned for their work than for\npersonal fame. On the other hand, there is no reason to doubt that the seven\nrecognised works are in truth from Kalidasa\'s hand. The only one concerning\nwhich there is reasonable room for suspicion is the short poem descriptive of\nthe seasons, and this is fortunately the least important of the seven. Nor is\nthere evidence to show that any considerable poem has been lost, unless it be\ntrue that the concluding cantos of one of the epics have perished. We are thus\nin a fortunate position in reading Kalidasa: we have substantially all that he\nwrote, and run no risk of ascribing to him any considerable work from another\nhand.\n\nOf these seven works, four are poetry throughout; the three dramas, like all\nSanskrit dramas, are written in prose, with a generous mingling of lyric and\ndescriptive stanzas. The poetry, even in the epics, is stanzaic; no part of it\ncan fairly be compared to English blank verse. Classical Sanskrit verse, so\nfar as structure is concerned, has much in common with familiar Greek and\nLatin forms:\n\np. xiv\n\nit makes no systematic use of rhyme; it depends for its rhythm not upon\naccent, but upon quantity. The natural medium of translation into English\nseems to me to be the rhymed stanza; 1 in the present work the rhymed stanza\nhas been used, with a consistency perhaps too rigid, wherever the original is\nin verse.\n\nKalidasa\'s three dramas bear the names: _Malavika and Agnimitra_ , _Urvashi_ ,\nand _Shakuntala_. The two epics are _The Dynasty of Raghu_ and _The Birth of\nthe War-god_. The elegiac poem is called _The Cloud-Messenge_ r, and the\ndescriptive poem is entitled _The Seasons_. It may be well to state briefly\nthe more salient features of the Sanskrit genres to which these works belong.\n\nThe drama proved in India, as in other countries, a congenial form to many of\nthe most eminent poets. The Indian drama has a marked individuality, but\nstands nearer to the modern European theatre than to that of ancient Greece;\nfor the plays, with a very few exceptions, have no religious significance, and\ndeal with love between man and woman. Although tragic elements may be present,\na tragic ending is forbidden. Indeed, nothing regarded as disagreeable, such\nas fighting or even kissing, is permitted on the stage; here Europe may\nperhaps learn a lesson in taste. Stage properties were few and simple, while\nparticular care was lavished on the music. The female parts were played by\nwomen. The plays very rarely have long monologues, even the inevitable\nprologue being divided between two speakers, but a Hindu audience was tolerant\nof lyrical digression.\n\nIt may be said, though the statement needs qualification in both directions,\nthat the Indian dramas have less action and less individuality in the\ncharacters, but more poetical charm than the dramas of modern Europe.\n\nOn the whole, Kalidasa was remarkably faithful to the ingenious but somewhat\nover-elaborate conventions of Indian dramaturgy. His first play, the _Malavika\nand Agnimitra_ , is entirely conventional in plot. The _Shakuntala_ is\ntransfigured by the character of the heroine. The _Urvashi_ , in spite of\ndetail beauty, marks a distinct decline.\n\np. xv\n\n_The Dynasty of Raghu_ and _The Birth of the War-god_ belong to a species of\ncomposition which it is not easy to name accurately. The Hindu name _kavya_\nhas been rendered by artificial epic, _e popee savante_, _Kunstgedicht_. It is\nbest perhaps to use the term epic, and to qualify the term by explanation.\n\nThe _kavyas_ differ widely from the _Mahabharata_ and the _Ramayana_ , epics\nwhich resemble the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ less in outward form than in their\ncharacter as truly national poems. The kavya is a narrative poem written in a\nsophisticated age by a learned poet, who possesses all the resources of an\nelaborate rhetoric and metric. The subject is drawn from time-honoured\nmythology. The poem is divided into cantos, written not in blank verse but in\nstanzas. Several stanza-forms are commonly employed in the same poem, though\nnot in the same canto, except that the concluding verses of a canto are not\ninfrequently written in a metre of more compass than the remainder.\n\nI have called _The Cloud-Messenger_ an elegiac poem, though it would not\nperhaps meet the test of a rigid definition. The Hindus class it with _The\nDynasty of Raghu_ and _The Birth of the War-god_ as a _kavya_ , but this\nclassification simply evidences their embarrassment. In fact, Kalidasa created\nin _The Cloud-Messenger_ a new genre. No further explanation is needed here,\nas the entire poem is translated below.\n\nThe short descriptive poem called _The Season_ s has abundant analogues in\nother literatures, and requires no comment.\n\nIt is not possible to fix the chronology of Kalidasa\'s writings, yet we are\nnot wholly in the dark. _Malavika and Agnimitr_ a was certainly his first\ndrama, almost certainly his first work. It is a reasonable conjecture, though\nnothing more, that Urvashi was written late, when the poet\'s powers were\nwaning. The introductory stanzas of _The Dynasty of Raghu_ suggest that this\nepic was written before _The Birth of the War-god_ , though the inference is\nfar from certain. Again, it is reasonable to assume that the great works on\nwhich Kalidasa\'s fame chiefly rests-- _Shakuntala_ , _The Cloud-Messenger_ ,\n_The Dynasty of Raghu_ ,\n\np. xvi\n\nthe first eight cantos of _The Birth of the War-god_ \\--were composed when he\nwas in the prime of manhood. But as to the succession of these four works we\ncan do little but guess.\n\nKalidasa\'s glory depends primarily upon the quality of his work, yet would be\nmuch diminished if he had failed in bulk and variety. In India, more than\nwould be the case in Europe, the extent of his writing is an indication of\noriginality and power; for the poets of the classical period underwent an\neducation that encouraged an exaggerated fastidiousness, and they wrote for a\npublic meticulously critical. Thus the great Bhavabhuti spent his life in\nconstructing three dramas; mighty spirit though he was, he yet suffers from\nthe very scrupulosity of his labour. In this matter, as in others, Kalidasa\npreserves his intellectual balance and his spiritual initiative: what\ngreatness of soul is required for this, every one knows who has ever had the\nmisfortune to differ in opinion from an intellectual clique.\n\n### III\n\nLe nom de Kalidasa domine la poesie indienne et la resume brillamment. Le\ndrame, l\'epopee savante, l\'elegie attestent aujourd\'hui encore la puissance et\nla souplesse de ce magnifique genie; seul entre les disciples de Sarasvati\n[the goddess of eloquence], il a eu le bonheur de produire un chef-d\'oeuvre\nvraiment classique, ou l\'Inde s\'admire et ou l\'humanite se reconnait. Les\napplaudissements qui saluerent la naissance de \xc3\x87akuntala a Ujjayini ont apres\nde longs siecles eclate d\'un bout du monde a l\'autre, quand William Jones\nl\'eut revelee a l\'Occident. Kalidasa a marque sa place dans cette pleiade\netincelante ou chaque nom resume une periode de l\'esprit humain. La serie de\nces noms forme l\'histoire, ou plutot elle est l\'histoire meme. 1\n\nIt is hardly possible to say anything true about Kalidasa\'s achievement which\nis not already contained in this appreciation. Yet one loves to expand the\npraise, even though realising that the critic is by his very nature a fool.\nHere\n\np. xvii\n\nthere shall at any rate be none of that cold-blooded criticism which imagines\nitself set above a world-author to appraise and judge, but a generous tribute\nof affectionate admiration.\n\nThe best proof of a poet\'s greatness is the inability of men to live without\nhim; in other words, his power to win and hold through centuries the love and\nadmiration of his own people, especially when that people has shown itself\ncapable of high intellectual and spiritual achievement.\n\nFor something like fifteen hundred years, Kalidasa has been more widely read\nin India than any other author who wrote in Sanskrit. There have also been\nmany attempts to express in words the secret of his abiding power: such\nattempts can never be wholly successful, yet they are not without considerable\ninterest. Thus Bana, a celebrated novelist of the seventh century, has the\nfollowing lines in some stanzas of poetical criticism which he prefixes to a\nhistorical romance:\n\nWhere find a soul that does not thrill  \n   In Kalidasa\'s verse to meet  \nThe smooth, inevitable lines  \n   Like blossom-clusters, honey-sweet?\n\nA later writer, speaking of Kalidasa and another poet, is more laconic in this\nalliterative line: _Bhaso hasah, Kalidaso vilasah_ \\--Bhasa is mirth, Kalidasa\nis grace.\n\nThese two critics see Kalidasa\'s grace, his sweetness, his delicate taste,\nwithout doing justice to the massive quality without which his poetry could\nnot have survived.\n\nThough Kalidasa has not been as widely appreciated in Europe as he deserves,\nhe is the only Sanskrit poet who can properly be said to have been appreciated\nat all. Here he must struggle with the truly Himalayan barrier of language.\nSince there will never be many Europeans, even among the cultivated, who will\nfind it possible to study the intricate Sanskrit language, there remains only\none means of presentation. None knows the cruel inadequacy of poetical\ntranslation like the translator. He understands better than others can, the\nsignificance of the position which Kalidasa has won in Europe. When Sir\nWilliam Jones first translated the _Shakuntala_ in 1789, his work was\nenthusiastically received in Europe, and most warmly, as was fitting, by the\ngreatest living poet of\n\np. xviii\n\n[paragraph continues] Europe. Since that day, as is testified by new\ntranslations and by reprints of the old, there have been many thousands who\nhave read at least one of Kalidasa\'s works; other thousands have seen it on\nthe stage in Europe and America.\n\nHow explain a reputation that maintains itself indefinitely and that conquers\na new continent after a lapse of thirteen hundred years? None can explain it,\nyet certain contributory causes can be named.\n\nNo other poet in any land has sung of happy love between man and woman as\nKalidasa sang. Every one of his works is a love-poem, however much more it may\nbe. Yet the theme is so infinitely varied that the reader never wearies. If\none were to doubt from a study of European literature, comparing the ancient\nclassics with modern works, whether romantic love be the expression of a\nnatural instinct, be not rather a morbid survival of decaying chivalry, he has\nonly to turn to India\'s independently growing literature to find the question\nsettled. Kalidasa\'s love-poetry rings as true in our ears as it did in his\ncountrymen\'s ears fifteen hundred years ago.\n\nIt is of love eventually happy, though often struggling for a time against\nexternal obstacles, that Kalidasa writes. There is nowhere in his works a\ntrace of that not quite healthy feeling that sometimes assumes the name\n"modern love." If it were not so, his poetry could hardly have survived; for\nhappy love, blessed with children, is surely the more fundamental thing. In\nhis drama _Urvashi_ he is ready to change and greatly injure a tragic story,\ngiven him by long tradition, in order that a loving pair may not be\npermanently separated. One apparent exception there is--the story of Rama and\nSita in _The Dynasty of Raghu_. In this case it must be remembered that Rama\nis an incarnation of Vishnu, and the story of a mighty god incarnate is not to\nbe lightly tampered with.\n\nIt is perhaps an inevitable consequence of Kalidasa\'s subject that his women\nappeal more strongly to a modern reader than his men. The man is the more\nvariable phenomenon, and though manly virtues are the same in all countries\nand centuries, the emphasis has been variously laid. But the true woman seems\ntimeless, universal. I know of no poet, unless it be Shakespeare, who has\ngiven\n\np. xix\n\nthe world a group of heroines so individual yet so universal; heroines as\ntrue, as tender, as brave as are Indumati, Sita, Parvati, the Yaksha\'s bride,\nand Shakuntala.\n\nKalidasa could not understand women without understanding children. It would\nbe difficult to find anywhere lovelier pictures of childhood than those in\nwhich our poet presents the little Bharata, Ayus, Raghu, Kumara. It is a fact\nworth noticing that Kalidasa\'s children are all boys. Beautiful as his women\nare, he never does more than glance at a little girl.\n\nAnother pervading note of Kalidasa\'s writing is his love of external nature.\nNo doubt it is easier for a Hindu, with his almost instinctive belief in\nreincarnation, to feel that all life, from plant to god, is truly one; yet\nnone, even among the Hindus, has expressed this feeling with such convincing\nbeauty as has Kalidasa. It is hardly true to say that he personifies rivers\nand mountains and trees; to him they have a conscious individuality as truly\nand as certainly as animals or men or gods. Fully to appreciate Kalidasa\'s\npoetry one must have spent some weeks at least among wild mountains and\nforests untouched by man; there the conviction grows that trees and flowers\nare indeed individuals, fully conscious of a personal life and happy in that\nlife. The return to urban surroundings makes the vision fade; yet the memory\nremains, like a great love or a glimpse of mystic insight, as an intuitive\nconviction of a higher truth.\n\nKalidasa\'s knowledge of nature is not only sympathetic, it is also minutely\naccurate. Not only are the snows and windy music of the Himalayas, the mighty\ncurrent of the sacred Ganges, his possession; his too are smaller streams and\ntrees and every littlest flower. It is delightful to imagine a meeting between\nKalidasa and Darwin. They would have understood each other perfectly; for in\neach the same kind of imagination worked with the same wealth of observed\nfact.\n\nI have already hinted at the wonderful balance in Kalidasa\'s character, by\nvirtue of which he found himself equally at home in a palace and in a\nwilderness. I know not with whom to compare him in this; even Shakespeare, for\nall his magical insight into natural beauty, is primarily\n\np. xx\n\na poet of the human heart. That can hardly be said of Kalidasa, nor can it be\nsaid that he is primarily a poet of natural beauty. The two characters unite\nin him, it might almost be said, chemically. The matter which I am clumsily\nendeavouring to make plain is beautifully epitomised in _The Cloud-Messenger_.\nThe former half is a description of external nature, yet interwoven with human\nfeeling; the latter half is a picture of a human heart, yet the picture is\nframed in natural beauty. So exquisitely is the thing done that none can say\nwhich half is superior. Of those who read this perfect poem in the original\ntext, some are more moved by the one, some by the other. Kalidasa understood\nin the fifth century what Europe did not learn until the nineteenth, and even\nnow comprehends only imperfectly: that the world was not made for man, that\nman reaches his full stature only as he realises the dignity and worth of life\nthat is not human.\n\nThat Kalidasa seized this truth is a magnificent tribute to his intellectual\npower, a quality quite as necessary to great poetry as perfection of form.\nPoetical fluency is not rare; intellectual grasp is not very uncommon: but the\ncombination has not been found perhaps more than a dozen times since the world\nbegan. Because he possessed this harmonious combination, Kalidasa ranks not\nwith Anacreon and Horace and Shelley, but with Sophocles, Vergil, Milton.\n\nHe would doubtless have been somewhat bewildered by Wordsworth\'s gospel of\nnature. "The world is too much with us," we can fancy him repeating. "How can\nthe world, the beautiful human world, be too much with us? How can sympathy\nwith one form of life do other than vivify our sympathy with other forms of\nlife?"\n\nIt remains to say what can be said in a foreign language of Kalidasa\'s style.\nWe have seen that he had a formal and systematic education; in this respect he\nis rather to be compared with Milton and Tennyson than with Shakespeare or\nBurns. He was completely master of his learning. In an age and a country which\nreprobated carelessness but were tolerant of pedantry, he held the scales with\na wonderfully even hand, never heedless and never indulging in the elaborate\ntrifling with Sanskrit diction which repels the reader from much of Indian\nliterature. It is\n\np. xxi\n\ntrue that some western critics have spoken of his disfiguring conceits and\npuerile plays on words. One can only wonder whether these critics have ever\nread Elizabethan literature; for Kalidasa\'s style is far less obnoxious to\nsuch condemnation than Shakespeare\'s. That he had a rich and glowing\nimagination, "excelling in metaphor," as the Hindus themselves affirm, is\nindeed true; that he may, both in youth and age, have written lines which\nwould not have passed his scrutiny in the vigour of manhood, it is not worth\nwhile to deny: yet the total effect left by his poetry is one of extraordinary\nsureness and delicacy of taste. This is scarcely a matter for argument; a\nreader can do no more than state his own subjective impression, though he is\nglad to find that impression confirmed by the unanimous authority of fifty\ngenerations of Hindus, surely the most competent judges on such a point.\n\nAnalysis of Kalidasa\'s writings might easily be continued, but analysis can\nnever explain life. The only real criticism is subjective. We know that\nKalidasa is a very great poet, because the world has not been able to leave\nhim alone.\n\nARTHUR W.

Still his words of wisdom shine:  \nAll\'s well with man, when man and woman love.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[x:1](sha02.htm#fr_0) These verses are translated on pp.\n[123](sha15.htm#page_123), 124.\n\n[x:2](sha02.htm#fr_1) The passage will be found on pp.\n[190](sha17.htm#page_190)-192.\n\n[xiv:1](sha02.htm#fr_2) This matter is more fully discussed in the\nintroduction to my translation of _The Little Clay Cart_ (1905).\n\n[xvi:1](sha02.htm#fr_3) Levi, _Le Th eatre Indien_, p. 163.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Dramatis Personae](sha03.htm)\n\n'
