In doing so I have\nendeavored to preserve the perfect authenticity and clearness of the original\nteachings of ten different well-known Oriental schools of yoga teaching and\npractice. This I am doing mainly direct from the original texts and with an\nextensive knowledge of their actual operation, acquired largely during my\nthirty-eight-years residence in the East.\n\nThen comes the remark: "We want to find out whether there is anything in these\nforms of yoga which we can use in our present civilization. Has it anything\nfor us?"\n\np. viii\n\nIt certainly has. In explanation of this reply, I will first mention that it\nwill be seen by the reader of this book that reflectiveness and meditation\nplay a large part in most of the yoga systems, and then add,\n\n"Half an hour spent in meditation or even in reflection in the morning is not\ntime wasted. It is not even time spent. It is time gained, because it will\nmake the rest of the day far more fruitful than it would otherwise have been."\n\n"How so?"\n\n"It will do this in four ways:\n\n"First, it will co-ordinate the contents of the mind on all aspects of the\nmatters in which you are currently interested, and ensure that nothing is\nmissed or overlooked.\n\n"Secondly, it will permit the rising of new ideas, through the recombinations\nof old ones, and suggestions arising from them.\n\n"Thirdly, it will exercise the mental faculty, and thus increase both its grip\nand its grasp, improving its functionality for the whole day, just as the\nmuscular development acquired by ten minutes\' exercise in the morning gives\nthe body greater strength for the whole day.\n\n"Fourthly, it will automatically work some of the magic of the mind, whereby\nyou will be put tele-magnetically into touch with things and persons you\n\np. ix\n\nare interested in, and thus it will create opportunities and even so-called\ncoincidences."\n\nIf this is not enough, let us add that it will open new fields of interest,\nespecially those which are concerned with the understanding and right use of\nlife itself.\n\nIt will also enrich consciousness itself. Inasmuch as we all enjoy\nconsciousness more than anything else it will be giving us the best of all\nbenefits. There is a story about two men who were talking about a little boy\nwho was licking an ice-cream cone. One remarked that the boy did not like ice-\ncream. The other, sensing a catch, said he supposed that what was meant by\nthat remark was that what was liked was the taste of the ice-cream. But the\nreply was that what the boy really liked was only the consciousness of the\ntaste of the ice-cream, and that applies to everything in our lives.\n\nWhy should not our subjective faculties be cultivated? We take care of our\nhorses and other animals, and give them proper food, exercise and rest. Why\nnot do the same for our mental faculties\xc2\x97also for our moral and spiritual\nones, too, and that not merely by the way?\n\nBut to return to the material practicality of the subject. Thousands of people\nare breaking down in modern life because they cannot stand the pace. Suppose\nwe can teach them how to keep up the pace of\n\np. x\n\noutward modern life but at the same time have such inner calm and poise that\nthey can stand it without strain and fatigue. That is something well worth\nwhile, is it not? Well, this is not an idle promise. It is a fact.\n\nBut you must be warned. What you gain in yoga must be accompanied by goodwill\ntowards others and the wish that they also may benefit in some way by your\nincreased knowledge and power. Without this there will be a recoil on your\nhead, just as sure as the magic of the magnetism of thought operates to\nbenefit you. But that is no hardship, is it, when we all know full well in\nthese enlightened days that there is no true pleasure in life when our\nneighbors or companions are suffering, and indeed almost the greatest of all\npleasures is to see others happy. This nature of ours is not merely negative\nand concerned with sympathy for the suffering. It is also positive\xc2\x97the\nenjoyment of the happiness of others. Is that not why people like a peaceful\ncountry scene? As one lady remarked a few days ago: "How much nicer the meadow\nis now that the cows are in it!"\n\nIn the present world crisis most of us are concerned not so much with the idea\nthat a bomb may fall on our own heads\xc2\x97we would rather it did so than on the\nheads of those near and dear to us, or on any considerable number of people\nanywhere. We are very\n\np. xi\n\nmuch concerned about the plight of humanity in general. We rejoice over the\nprosperity of the average family of today, and we quake to think that it may\nbe destroyed and an age of torment and slavery may engulf it. We think of the\nwelfare of the children and the aged, and most of us would not enjoy a\npersonal prosperity built upon the sufferings of these.\n\nThese are matters which yoga also puts before us, studies and explains, so\nthat we learn that happiness is a matter not merely of physical, emotional and\nmental health and strength, and these in balance\xc2\x97no small matter\xc2\x97but of social\nand moral and ethical health and balance also, and even something more of\nwhich we know only the rudiments now, namely that which we call the spiritual\nself, from the consecration by which all the invigoration of our powers\nproceeds.\n\nLet us be definite and certain about this. If by some personal suffering or\nloss you could stop for good and all the sort of war that took place in\nKorea\xc2\x97stop the maiming and killing of unbelligerent men, stop the ruin and\nslaughter of gentle people, the populations of admirable lands of ancient\nculture, such as Korea was\xc2\x97how far would you go in that loss and suffering?\nMost people would go to the limit. Does this not tell us that it is _ability_\nwe lack, not _love_ of our fellowmen? We are held back by helplessness, not by\nselfishness. If the issue could be squarely put, how many\n\np. xii\n\nwould shrink from the supreme sacrifice? Very few. It is the sort of thing Tom\nPaine asked the people of the American Colonies to do when George Washington\nwas on the wrong side of victory, and most of them held off through that\nhelpless feeling, but there were enough responses to turn the tide, and ensure\nthe material establishment of a grand set of social ideals which are again in\ndanger today.\n\nWashington acted much because he had thought and felt much. We do not think\nenough\xc2\x97that is what is the matter. Let us have some practice and more know-how\nin thinking\xc2\x97that is what yoga can give to every one. Not to make the opposite\nerror, to sink ourselves in thought, as some have done, but to invigorate and\nrationalize the whole of living by the awakening of more of man-ness in our\nminds.\n\nThe man-ness of man is constantly being surrendered to externals. This is one\nof the warnings of the yoga theoreticians. By a curious paradox of our life,\nthe very service of mammon, as we may call it, is often the one thing which\ncalls the man-ness of man into activity. I must explain. The human body has\nits more or less permanent set-up, with a group of pains and pleasures geared\nto its activities and designed primarily to warn it against dangers and tempt\nit into healthful activities, which have for the most part become automatic.\nWhen, for example, the needs of\n\np. xiii\n\nthe body are satisfied with food, the natural appetite dies away for the time\nbeing, and if it is then stimulated artificially by exciting spices pain will\narise after some time and tend to stop that excess. To correct this and\nnumerous other troubles the man-ness of the man, in the shape of his power of\nthought and affection is aroused. But it is rather a pitiful situation that\nthe man-ness of the man should be awakened and operated for such negative\nreasons, when it is really the activity of that man-ness which is the chief\npossibility of enjoyment in human life.\n\nThus we have heard recently a story of two boys who now, as men, are regarded\nas fine examples of the resolute betterment of human life. Briefly, they\nmortgaged everything they had and went into the silver fox business and made a\nlot of money. That was the betterment! And presumably they then settled down\nto a life of bodily enjoyment or bodily excitement, the chief feature of which\ncould be described as the consciousness bathing, as it were, in the body\'s\nenjoyment. How different from the pursuit of knowledge, affection and\nart\xc2\x97which grow by exercise, and show us the man enjoying _himself_ , or\nenjoying, to use my previous phrase, the man-ness of man, and thereby\nincreasing his man-ness.\n\nThe paradox of the situation is resolved by the knowledge that all material\ngains _can be used_ for the\n\np. xiv\n\npurposes of the real man that we all the time truly are, did we but observe\nand remember that important fact. It could be summed up in the old trinity of\ntruth, goodness and beauty, resulting from the use of honest thought,\naffection and the will. And when they are so used there is more man-ness and\nin consequence more happiness.\n\nBriefly, then, the great yog\xc4\xabs do not teach abandonment of circumstances, but\ntriumph over circumstances. The result is that man being true to himself\novercomes all his troubles\xc2\x97of body, emotions and mind\xc2\x97and there is then\nharmony between the outer and the inner life. It could then be said that man\ndoes not serve mammon, but mammon serves him.\n\nNow we must notice a very important principle of yoga, which arises from this\nrecognition of the true nature of man. It is that in yoga practice there must\nbe no negativity or passivity of the man. Anything in the nature of hypnotism,\nsuggestion or auto-suggestion, repetition of words, sentences or ideas to form\n_habits_ of thought or feeling is strictly taboo.\n\nThe emotions and the ideas which constantly spring up from past associations\nare to be used _under the surveillance of the real man_ in all circumstances.\nWith his present powers of thought, love and the will he will either permit\nthem or change them, as the case may be, just as he permits or orders the body\nto\n\np. xv\n\nwalk or jump or talk on a given occasion, and does not expect it to follow old\nhabits of activity but to keep quiet when he does not want it to do something.\nThe body must be well treated, of course, like a good horse, but it is not\nsupposed to run around the country-side on its own account. Similarly, the\nemotions and the mind should be quiet, having only that functional flow which\nin them is analogous to the movements of breathing, heart action, digestion\netc. in the body.\n\nThis matter of _no passivity_ appears very clearly in the practice of\nconcentration, meditation and contemplation. Concentration is _voluntary\nattentiveness_ to something. This brings about a contraction which is at the\nsame time an intensification of consciousness, somewhat analogous to placing a\nreflector round a lamp. Meditation, which proceeds as soon as concentration is\nestablished, is an _expansion of attention_ to the object _without loss of\nthis intensification_. It thus consists of a flow or fountain of observation\nand thought about the object. When this process is complete it can be followed\nby an _active poise_ of the mind, without any passivity, which is\ncontemplation. At the end of the meditation it will be observed, the thinking\nstops. Then the _new process_ \xc2\x97a third process\xc2\x97must go on without any\ndiminution of the high quality or intensity of consciousness obtained by the\n\np. xvi\n\nconcentration or voluntary attention. If the reader tries this method with\nsome perseverance he will soon find the benefit of it, in the consciousness,\nin the powers of the mind (will, love and thought) and in the body and his\nworld of things and events.\n\nIt will soon be found that this three-fold meditation, practiced at first at\nspecial times, begins to work with great swiftness even in the midst of\nactivity, and even amid what were previously regarded as disturbing\ncircumstances. In this connection one wishes again to issue the warning that\nincrease of knowledge and power without love will lead to a point of great\nrecoil. No organism can continue if it develops one or two of its functions at\nthe expense of the rest\xc2\x97that is obvious in the body, which to be healthy must\nhave harmoniousness and balance in all its parts. This is true with regard to\nthe three parts of the man-ness of us. One cannot know everything, love\neverything, do everything, but what one does in the small area of a human\nbeing\'s life must be _positive_ in thought, love and the will. There can be no\nhate and such emotions, no carelessness of judgment, no surrender of the will,\nall of which imply negativity and waste of man-ness. There can and indeed must\nbe relaxation, but this also must be voluntary. Voluntary relaxation carried\non with your approval, sometimes with your assistance.\n\np. xvii\n\nAnother question is, "What is the relation between mysticism and yoga?"\n\nIn connection with this we have to think of yoga as goal\xc2\x97not only as methods\nor the way to the goal. The goal of yoga is the Beyond. Some call this God.\nGod is the Beyond. This word Beyond only is used in the _Bhagavad G \xc4\xabt\xc4\x81_ for\nwhat in the West we call the goal or God. To know the Beyond and to enter the\nBeyond are familiar expressions. If someone asks what God is we cannot in\nthese enlightened days say "He is a big man, an exacting but benevolent old\ngentleman with a white beard," nor even, "He is a great mind, a great thinker\nand lover and law-giver." We have to admit that God is the _Beyond_ , beyond\nboth world and mind, _beyond object and subject_ , and therefore a Mystery,\nexcept to those who have experience of the Beyond. The very word mystic means\n"with the eyes closed"\xc2\x97in terms of yoga we say with the eyes of the body and\nthe eyes of the mind\xc2\x97both sets\xc2\x97closed. There are, of course, mystic eyes\nbelonging to the Beyond. That is another truth. Man has them, but scarcely\nknows it, and so has in most cases still to learn to use them. He is sometimes\nreminded that he has them by the rare God-knowers of past or present.\n\nOne last question: "Why Oriental yoga? Why not merely yoga? Surely this yoga\ncannot be Oriental or\n\np. xviii\n\n[paragraph continues] Occidental, any more than science or, strictly,\nreligion, or the good life."\n\nThe answer is that many Eastern thinkers and writers have dealt with this\nsubject, and have left us books explaining it. That is all we mean by the word\nOriental in this matter. Those books have their individual emphasis on the use\nand study of thought or of love\xc2\x97the human feeling\xc2\x97or the will, but all concur\nin the nature of the goal. The subject has not been dealt with so extensively\nin the new civilizations of Europe and America, which have been mostly engaged\nin building a satisfactory material life. Let us therefore blend the knowledge\nfrom the Orient with the culture of body and environment which we have derived\nfrom Greece and the culture of the heart which has been accepted from\nPalestine.\n\nERNEST WOOD\n\nBethel,  \nConnecticut.  \nNovember, 1953.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter One.
