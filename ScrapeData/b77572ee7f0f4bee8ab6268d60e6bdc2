There lived once upon a time _G_ ana _s_ ruti Pautraya _n_ a (the great-\ngrandson of _G_ ana _s_ ruta), who was a pious giver, bestowing much wealth\nupon the\n\np. 56\n\npeople, and always keeping open house. He built places of refuge everywhere,\nwishing that people should everywhere eat of his food.\n\n2\\. Once in the night some Ha _m_ sas (flamingoes) flew over his house, and\none flamingo said to another: 'Hey, Bhallaksha, Bhallaksha (short-sighted\nfriend). The light (glory) of _G_ ana _s_ ruti Pautraya _n_ a has spread like\nthe sky. Do not go near, that it may not burn thee.'\n\n3\\. The other answered him: 'How can you speak of him, being what he is (a ra\n_g_ anya, noble), as if he were like Raikva with the car 1?'\n\n4\\. The first replied: 'How is it with this Raikva with the car of whom thou\nspeakest?'\n\nThe other answered: 'As (in a game of dice) all the lower casts 2 belong to\nhim who has conquered with the K _ri_ ta cast, so whatever good deeds other\npeople perform, belong to that Raikva. He who knows what he knows, he is thus\nspoken of by me.'\n\n5\\. _G_ ana _s_ ruti Pautraya _n_ a overheard this conversation, and as soon\nas he had risen in the morning, he said to his. door-keeper (kshatt _ri_ ):\n'Friend, dost thou speak of (me, as if I were) Raikva with the car?'\n\nHe replied: 'How is it with this Raikva, with the car?'\n\n6\\. The king said: 'As (in a game of dice), all the lower casts belong to him\nwho has conquered with the K _ri_ ta cast, so whatever good deeds other people\nperform, belong to that Raikva. He who knows what he knows, he is thus spoken\nof by me.'\n\np. 57\n\n7\\. The door-keeper went to look for Raikva, but returned saying, 'I found him\nnot.' Then the king said: 'Alas! where a Brahma _n_ a should be searched for\n(in the solitude of the forest), there go for him.'\n\n8\\. The door-keeper came to a man who was lying beneath a car and scratching\nhis sores 1. He addressed him, and said: 'Sir, are you Raikva with the car? '\n\nHe answered: 'Here I am.'\n\nThen the door-keeper returned, and said: 'I have found him.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[55:2](sbe01078.htm#fr_195) Vayu (air) and Pra _n_ a (breath) had before been\nrepresented as feet of Brahman, as the second pair. Now they are represented\nas Brahman, and as to be meditated on as such. This is the teaching of Raikva.\nThe language of this chapter is very obscure, and I am not satisfied with the\ntranslation.\n\n[56:1](sbe01078.htm#fr_196) Sayugvan is explained as possessed of a car with\nyoked horses or oxen. Could it have meant originally, 'yoke-fellow, equal,' as\nin Rig-veda X, 130, 4? Anquetil renders it by 'semper cum se ipso camelum\nsolutum habens.'\n\n[56:2](sbe01078.htm#fr_197) Instead of adhareya _h_ , we must read adhare 'ya\n_h_.\n\n[57:1](sbe01078.htm#fr_198) It is curious that in a hymn of the Atharva-veda\n(V, 22, 5, 8) takman, apparently a disease of the skin, is relegated to the\nMahav _ri_ shas, where Raikva dwelt.
