Sing [1](sbe46120.htm#an_5:16:1:1) (a song that gives) mighty vital power,\nto the light, to god Agni, whom the mortals have placed in front\n[2](sbe46120.htm#an_5:16:1:2) like Mitra by their praises\n[3](sbe46120.htm#an_5:16:1:3).\n\n2\\. For he, Agni, the Hot _ri_ of men, day by day, in the arms of Daksha,\ndiscloses the offering in the due way, as Bhaga [1](sbe46120.htm#an_5:16:2:1)\n(discloses) a treasure.\n\n3\\. (We abide [?]) in his praise, the liberal (god's), in his friendship, the\nmightily brilliant one's, in whom, the loudly roaring Aryan, all (beings) have\nput together their strength.\n\n4\\. For verily, O Agni, (thou belongest [?]) to them\n[1](sbe46120.htm#an_5:16:4:1) through thy bounteousness\n[2](sbe46120.htm#an_5:16:4:2) in (bestowing) abundance of heroes. Him indeed,\nthe vigorous one, his glory the two worlds could not encompass\n[3](sbe46120.htm#an_5:16:4:3).\n\n5\\. Now then, Agni, come hither and, being praised, bring treasure\n[1](sbe46120.htm#an_5:16:5:1) to us who, we ourselves and our liberal givers,\nmay acquire welfare together. And help us to grow strong in fights.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe _Ri_ shi is Puru \xc3\x82treya (cf. 17, 1); the metre Anush _t_ ubh (verse 5,\nPa\xe1\xb9\x85kti). This hymn and V, 17 are parallel hymns; the concluding words of both\nare identical (see also V, 9, 7; 10, 7).--Verse 5 = SV. I, 88.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. \xc3\x81r _k_ a may be first or second person.\n\np. 402\n\nNote 2. Dadhire pura _h_ : they have made him their Purohita.\n\nNote 3. Comp. above, V, 9, 6.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. On Bhaga, the divine Bestower or Dispenser of riches, cf. Herbert\nBaynes. The Biography of Bhaga (Actes du huitieme Congres intern. des\nOrientalistes, Sect. II, fasc. 1, pp. 83 seq.).\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. To them, i. e. the Maghavans. Compare below, 18, 3. 4.\n\nNote 2. Ma _m_ hana seems to be instrumental. Comp. 10. 2; 18, 2.\n\nNote 3. Agni is himself yahva; so na cannot be the comparative particle, but\nit must be the negation. Similarly it is said in II, 16, 3 that Heaven and\nEarth cannot encompass the indriya of Indra; cf. also X, 27, 7.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Va\xc2\xb4ryam seems to depend on a\xc2\xb4 bhara. With the whole phrase compare the\nfirst Pada of V, 17, 5.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 17](sbe46121.htm)\n\n"
