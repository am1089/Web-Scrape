A woman is not independent, the males are her masters. It has been\ndeclared in the Veda, \'A female who neither goes naked nor is temporarily\nunclean is paradise.\' 1\n\n2\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): \'Their fathers protect them in\nchildhood, their husbands protect them in youth, and their sons protect them\nin age; a woman is never fit for independence.\' 2\n\n3\\. The penance (to be performed) by a (wife) for being unfaithful to her\nhusband has been declared in the (section on) secret penances. 3\n\np. 32\n\n4\\. For month by month the menstrual excretion takes away her sins. 4\n\n5\\. A woman in her courses is impure during three (days and) nights. 5\n\n6\\. (During that period) she shall not apply collyrium to her eyes, nor anoint\n(her body), nor bathe in water; she shall sleep on the ground; she shall not\nsleep in the day-time, nor touch the fire, nor make a rope, nor clean her\nteeth, nor eat meat, nor look at the planets, nor smile, nor busy herself with\n(house-hold affairs), nor run; she shall drink out of a large vessel, or out\nof her joined hands, or out of a copper vessel. 6\n\n7\\. For it has been declared in the Veda, \'When Indra had slain (V _ri_ tra)\nthe three-headed son of Tvash _t_ _ri_ , he was seized by Sin, and he\nconsidered himself to be tainted with exceedingly great guilt. All beings\ncried out against him (saying to him), 7\n\np. 33\n\n[paragraph continues] \'O thou slayer of a learned Brahma _n_ a! O thou slayer\nof a learned Brahma _n_ a!\' He ran to the women for protection (and said to\nthem), \'Take upon yourselves the third part of this my guilt (caused by) the\nmurder of a learned Brahma _n_ a.\' They answered, \'\'What shall we have (for\ndoing thy wish)?\' He replied, \'Choose a boon.\' They said, \'Let us obtain\noffspring (if our husbands approach us) during the proper season, at pleasure\nlet us dwell (with our husbands until (our children) are born.\' He answered,\n\'So be it.\' (Then) they took upon themselves (the third part of his guilt).\nThat guilt of Brahma _n_ a-murder appears every month as the menstrual flow.\nTherefore let him not eat the food of a woman in her courses; (for) such a one\nhas put on the shape of the guilt of Brahma _n_ a-murder.\n\n8\\. (Those who recite the Veda) proclaim the following (rule): \'Collyrium and\nointment must not be accepted from her; for that is the food of women.\nTherefore they feel a loathing for her (while she is) in that (condition,\nsaying), "She shall not approach."\' 8\n\n9\\. \'Those (Brahma _n_ as in) whose (houses) menstruating women sit, those who\nkeep no sacred fire, 9\n\np. 34\n\nand those in whose family there is no _S_ rotriya; all these are equal to _S_\nudras.\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[31:1](sbe1408.htm#fr_189) **V**. Vish _n_ u XXV, 12. The second clause ought\nto have been given as a separate Sutra. \'A female who no longer goes naked,\'\ni.e. one who has reached the age of puberty. Am _ri_ tam, \'is paradise,\' i.e.\nprocures bliss in this life and heaven after death through her children.\n\n[31:2](sbe1408.htm#fr_190) Vish _n_ u XXV, 13. Identical with Manu IX, 3.\n\n[31:3](sbe1408.htm#fr_191) \'The penance which has been ordained in case a wife\nis unfaithful to her husband, i.e. goes to a lover and so forth, must be\nperformed in secret, i.e. in solitary places.\'--K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita.\nThe explanation is clearly erroneous. Rahasyeshu cannot mean \'in secret\' or\n\'in secret places.\' It might refer either to a. work or works called Rahasyani\nor to the rahasyani praya _s_ _k_ ittani. As p. 32 the next Sutra contains a\nhalf-verse taken from the section on secret penances, XXVIII, 4, it is evident\nthat Vasish _th_ a here makes a cross-reference. Similar cross-references\noccur further on.\n\n[32:4](sbe1408.htm#fr_192) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 72, and below, XXVIII, 4.\n\n[32:5](sbe1408.htm#fr_193) Vish _n_ u XXII, 72.\n\n[32:6](sbe1408.htm#fr_194) Taitt. Sa _m_ h. II, 5, I, 6-7. I read with the\nmajority of the MSS., grahanna niriksheta instead of g _ri_ han na niriksheta,\nwhich latter phrase K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita renders by \'she shall not\nlook out of the house.\' My reading is confirmed by his quotation from the Sm\n_ri_ tima _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ari, where graha _n_ a _m_ niriksha _n_ am, \'looking at the\nplanets, i.e. the sun, moon,\' &c., is forbidden. \'A large vessel,\' i.e. an\nearthen jar.--K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita.\n\n[32:7](sbe1408.htm#fr_195) Taitt. Sarah. II, 5, I, 2-5. The name \'slayer of a\nlearned Brahma _n_ a\' is applied to Indra, because V _ri_ tra is said to have\nbeen deeply versed in the Vedas. Regarding the \'proper season of women,\' see\nManu III, 46-48. In the clause \'That guilt of Brahma _n_ a-murder appears,\'\n&c., I read avir bhavati with the majority of the MSS. For the prohibition to\naccept food from a-ra _g_ asvala, see Vish _n_ u LI, 16-17.\n\n[33:8](sbe1408.htm#fr_196) Taitt. Sarah. II, 5, 1, 6. I read the text of this\nSutra as follows: \'Tadahu _h_ \\--a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ anabhya _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ anam evasya na\npratigrahya _m_ taddhi striya annam iti--tasmat tasyai _k_ a tatra _k_ a\nbibhatsante meyam upagad iti.\' The MSS. give the following readings in the\nsecond clause: tasmat tasmai _k_ a (B. Bh. E. F,), tatra na (F.), medhamupagad\n(Bh. F.), medha upagad (E.), seyamupagad (B.) K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita\nfollows as usually MS. B. His explanation of the whole Sutra is erroneous.\n\'That is the food of women,\' i.e. that is as necessary to women as their food,\nbecause to beautify themselves is one of their duties.\n\n[33:9](sbe1408.htm#fr_197) The meaning of the Sutra is that a Brahmanical\nbeggar must not accept any alms from Brahma _n_ as whose wives are in their p.\n34 courses, who keep no sacred fire, and do not attend to the duty of Veda-\nstudy. Regarding sinners of the latter two kinds, see also \xc3\x82pastamba I, 6, 18,\n32-33.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VI](sbe1409.htm)\n\n'
