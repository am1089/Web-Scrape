The reception given to it both in India and in England was most\ngratifying, practically the only serious condemnation of it being that I had\nnot pronounced judgment on much that I had quoted from the Hindu sacred books.\nThis was a task that I distinctly disavowed in my preface. I set out with the\nintention of rigidly abstaining from comment, commendatory or condemnatory. I\nfeel that a mere statement of much that was written in books professedly\ninspired by God, carried its own condemnation. And at the same time it was a\npleasure to indicate how, amid much evil, there was also much good. The sages\nof India were not in complete darkness. As we examine the earlier writings,\nthe light was bright indeed contrasted with what came later. It is most\ninstructive to notice the marked deterioration in the quality of the teaching,\ndeities as described by the earlier sages being vastly better than their\nsuccessors declare them to be. "Non-Christian Bibles are all developments in\nthe wrong direction. They begin with some flashes of true light, and end in\ndarkness." As Max-Muller says, "The more we go back, the more we examine the\nearliest\n\np. xii\n\ngerms of any religion, the purer I believe we shall find the conceptions of\nthe Deity."\n\nIn this edition there is some added matter. Errors have been corrected, and an\nattempt made to render certain passages more clear that were somewhat obscure.\nSubstantially the book remains the same. An account of the ordinary worship\nand the festivals of these gods will be found in another work--"Modern\nHinduism."\n\nW. J.
