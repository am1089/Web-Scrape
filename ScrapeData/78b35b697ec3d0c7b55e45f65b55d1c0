Instead of the Kamya ceremonies (i.e. the ceremonies, prescribed in the\n_S_ rauta-sutra, by which\n\np. 224\n\nspecial wishes are attained, oblations of) boiled (rice) grains, for the\nattainment of those wishes, (should be made by the G _ri_ hya sacrificer).\n\n2\\. He attains (thereby) those same wishes.\n\n3\\. For a person that is sick, or suffering, or affected with consumption, a\nmess of boiled (rice) grains in six oblations (should he offered)\xc2\x97\n\n4\\. With this (hymn), 'I loosen thee by sacrificial food, that thou mayst\nlive' (Rig-veda X, 161).\n\n5\\. If he has seen a bad dream, he should worship the sun with the two verses,\n'To-day, god Savit _ri_ ' (Rig-veda V, 82, 4, 5), and with the five verses,\n'What bad dreams there are among the cows' (Rig-veda VIII, 47, 14 seqq.),\n\n6\\. Or with (the verse), 'Whosoever, O king, be it a companion or a friend'\n(Rig-veda II, 28, 10).\n\n7\\. When he has sneezed, yawned, seen a disagreeable sight, smelt a bad smell,\nwhen his eye palpitates, and when he hears noises in his ears, he should\nmurmur, 'Well-eyed may I become with my eyes, well-vigoured with my face,\nwell-hearing with my ears. May will and insight dwell in me!'\n\n8 8. If he has gone to a wife to whom he ought not to go, or if he has\nperformed a sacrifice for a person for whom he ought not to do so, or has\neaten forbidden food, or accepted what he ought not to accept, or pushed\nagainst a piled-up (fire altar) or\n\np. 225\n\nagainst a sacrificial post, he should sacrifice two \xc3\x82 _g_ ya oblations with\n(the verses),\n\n'May my faculties return into me, may life return, may prosperity return; may\nmy goods return to me; may the divine power return into me. Svaha!\n\n'These fires that are stationed on the (altars called) Dhish _n_ yas, may they\nbe here in good order, each on its right place. (Agni) Vai _s_ vanara, grown\nstrong, the standard of immortality, may he govern my mind in my heart.\nSvaha!'\n\n9\\. Or (he may sacrifice) two pieces of wood,\n\n10\\. Or murmur (the same two verses without any oblation).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[223:1](sbe29139.htm#fr_546) 6, 1. Naraya _n_ a divides this Sutra into two:\n1. atha kamyana _m_ sthane kamya _h_ ; 2. _k_ arava _h_.\n\n[224:8](sbe29139.htm#fr_547) Naraya _n_ a is evidently wrong in explaining _k_\naitya _m_ yupa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a by agni _k_ ayanastha _m_ yupa _m_ (which is not, as\nProf. Stenzler takes it, der Opferpfahl auf einem Bestattungsplatze). Comp.\nGobhila III, 3, 34; G _ri_ hya-sa _m_ graha-pari _s_ ish _t_ a II, 4.\n\nI have translated the second verse in Sutra 8, as if the text had kalpantam.\nThe MSS. give kalpatam. Atharva-veda VII, 67 has kalpayantam.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 7](sbe29140.htm)\n\n"
