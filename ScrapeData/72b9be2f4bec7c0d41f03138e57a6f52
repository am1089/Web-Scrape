But it (viz. the dream world) is mere illusion (maya), on account of its\nnature not manifesting itself with the totality (of the attributes of\nreality).\n\nThe word 'but' discards the purvapaksha. It is not true that the world of\ndreams is real; it is mere illusion and there is not a particle of reality in\nit.--Why?--'On account of its nature not manifesting itself with the\ntotality,' i.e. because the nature of the dream world does not manifest itself\nwith the totality of the attributes of real things.--What then do you mean by\nthe 'totality'?--The fulfilment of the conditions of place, time, and cause,\nand the circumstance of non-refutation. All these have their sphere in real\nthings, but cannot be applied to dreams. In the first place there is, in a\ndream, no space for chariots and the like; for\n\np. 135\n\nthose cannot possibly find room in the limited confines of the body.--Well,\nbut why should not the dreaming person see the objects of his dream outside of\nhis body? He does as a matter of fact perceive things as separated from\nhimself by space; and _S_ ruti, moreover, declares that the dream is outside\nthe body, 'Away from the nest the Immortal moves; that immortal one goes\nwherever he likes' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 12). And this distinction of the\nconceptions of staying and going would have no good sense if the being (the\nsoul) did not really go out.--What you maintain is inadmissible, we reply. A\nsleeping being cannot possibly possess the power to go and return in a moment\nthe distance of a hundred yo _g_ anas. Sometimes, moreover, a person recounts\na dream in which he went to some place without returning from it, 'Lying on my\nbed in the land of the Kurus I was overcome by sleep and went in my dream to\nthe country of the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ alas, and being there I awoke.' If, now, that\nperson had really gone out of his country, he would on waking find himself in\nthe country of the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ alas to which he had gone in his dream; but as a\nmatter of fact he awakes in the country of the Kurus.--Moreover, while a man\nimagines himself in his dream going, in his body, to another place, the\nbystanders see that very same body lying on the couch. Further, a dreaming\nperson does not see, in his dream, other places such as they really are. But\nif he in seeing them did actually go about, they would appear to him like the\nthings he sees in his waking state. _S_ ruti, moreover, declares that the\ndream is within the body, cp. the passage beginning 'But when he moves about\nin dream,' and terminating 'He moves about, according to his pleasure, within\nhis own body' (B _ri_. Up. II, 1, 18). Hence the passage about the dreamer\nmoving away from his nest must be taken in a metaphorical sense, as otherwise\nwe should contradict scripture as well as reason; he who while remaining\nwithin his own body does not use it for any purpose may be said to be outside\nthe body as it were. The difference of the ideas of staying within the body\nand going outside must, therefore, be viewed as a mere deception.--In the\nsecond place we see that dreams are in conflict with\n\np. 136\n\nthe conditions of time. One person lying asleep at night dreams that it is day\nin the Bharata Varsha; another lives, during a dream which lasts one muhurta\nonly, through many crowds of years.--In the third place there do not exist in\nthe state of dreaming the requisite efficient causes for either thought or\naction; for as, in sleep, the organs are drawn inward, the dreaming person has\nno eyes, &c. for perceiving chariots and other things; and whence should he,\nin the space of the twinkling of an eye, have the power of--or procure the\nmaterial for--making chariots and the like?--In the fourth place the chariots,\nhorses, &c., which the dream creates, are refuted, i.e. shown not to exist by\nthe waking state. And apart from this, the dream itself refutes what it\ncreates, as its end often contradicts its beginning; what at first was\nconsidered to be a chariot turns, in a moment, into a man, and what was\nconceived to be a man has all at once become a tree.--Scripture itself,\nmoreover, clearly declares the chariots, &c., of a dream to have no real\nexistence, 'There are no chariots in that state, no horses, no roads, &c.'--\nHence the visions of a dream are mere illusion.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2, 4](sbe38107.htm)\n\n"
