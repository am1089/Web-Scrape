If it be said that on account of reference to the other one he is meant;\nwe say no, on account of impossibility.\n\nAn objection is raised to the argumentation that, on account of complementary\npassages, the small ether must be explained to mean the highest Self.\n\nFor, the objector says, a clear reference to him who is 'other' than the\nhighest Self, i.e. to the individual soul, is contained in the following\npassage (VIII, 12, 3): 'Thus does that serenity (samprasada), having risen\nfrom this body and approached the highest light, appear in its own form.'\n'That is the Self,' he said. 'That is the immortal, the fearless, this is\nBrahman' (VIII, 7, 3?). We admit that for the different reasons stated above\nthe ether within the heart cannot be the elemental ether; but owing to the\nforce of the intimations conveyed by the complementary passages just quoted,\nwe must adopt the view that what is meant is the individual soul. And as the\nword 'aka _s_ a' may be connected with praka _s_ a (light), it may be applied\nto the individual soul also.--This view is set aside by the Sutra. The small\nether cannot be the individual soul because the qualities attributed in the\ntext to the former, viz. freedom from sin, &c., cannot possibly belong to the\nindividual soul.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 18. ... the soul in so far as its true nature has become\nmanifest](sbe48117.htm)\n\n"
