And on account of their difference of nature (the ideas of the waking\nstate) are not like those of a dream.\n\nWe now apply ourselves to the refutation of the averment made by the Bauddha,\nthat the ideas of posts, and so on, of which we are conscious in the waking\nstate, may arise in the absence of external objects, just as the ideas of a\ndream, both being ideas alike.--The two sets of ideas, we maintain, cannot be\ntreated on the same footing, on account of the difference of their character.\nThey differ as follows.--The things of which we are conscious in a dream are\nnegated by our waking consciousness. 'I wrongly thought that I had a meeting\nwith a great man; no such meeting took place, but my mind was dulled by\nslumber, and so the\n\np. 425\n\nfalse idea arose.' In an analogous manner the things of which we are conscious\nwhen under the influence of a magic illusion, and the like, are negated by our\nordinary consciousness. Those things, on the other hand, of which we are\nconscious in our waking state, such as posts and the like, are never negated\nin any state.--Moreover, the visions of a dream are acts of remembrance, while\nthe visions of the waking state are acts of immediate consciousness; and the\ndistinction between remembrance and immediate consciousness is directly\ncognised by every one as being founded on the absence or presence of the\nobject. When, for instance, a man remembers his absent son, he does not\ndirectly perceive him, but merely wishes so to perceive him. As thus the\ndistinction between the two states is evident to every one, it is impossible\nto formulate the inference that waking consciousness is false because it is\nmere consciousness, such as dreaming consciousness; for we certainly cannot\nallow would-be philosophers to deny the truth of what is directly evident to\nthemselves. Just because they feel the absurdity of denying what is evident to\nthemselves, and are consequently unable to demonstrate the baselessness of the\nideas of the waking state from those ideas themselves, they attempt to\ndemonstrate it from their having certain attributes in common with the ideas\nof the dreaming state. But if some attribute cannot belong to a thing on\naccount of the latter's own nature, it cannot belong to it on account of the\nthing having certain attributes in common with some other thing. Fire, which\nis felt to be hot, cannot be demonstrated to be cold, on the ground of its\nhaving attributes in common with water. And the difference of nature between\nthe waking and the sleeping state we have already shown.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 30](sbe34206.htm)\n\n"
