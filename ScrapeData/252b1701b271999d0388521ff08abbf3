On the passing away of the works (the soul redescends) with a remainder,\naccording to scripture and Sm _ri_ ti, as it went (i.e. passing through the\nsame stations) and not thus (i.e. in the inverse order).\n\nScripture states that the souls of those who perform sacrifices, and the like,\nrise on the road leading through smoke, and so on, to the sphere of the moon,\nand when they have done with the enjoyment (of the fruits of their works)\nagain descend, 'Having dwelt there, yavatsampatam 2, they return again that\nway as they came,' &c., up to 'Those whose conduct has been good obtain some\ngood birth, the\n\np. 113\n\nbirth of a Brahma _n_ a, &c.--Those whose conduct has been evil obtain the\nbirth of a dog, &c.' ( _Kh_. Up. V, 10, 5-7). Here it must be considered\nwhether the souls, after having enjoyed the fruits of all their works, descend\nwithout a remainder (anu _s_ aya, of their works), or with such a remainder\n(of unrequited works).--The purvapakshin says: without such a remainder.--Why?\n--On account of the specification 'yavat sampatam.' The word sampata here\ndenotes the aggregate of works (karma _s_ aya) 1, which is so called because\nby it the souls pass from this world to that world for the purpose of enjoying\nthe fruits of the works. So that the entire clause 'Having dwelt there as far\nas the aggregate of the works extends' indicates their works being completely\nrequited there. The same thing is indicated by another scriptural passage,\n'But when in their case that (i.e. the effect of their works) ceases' (B _ri_.\nUp. VI, 2, 16).--Well, but why should we not assume that these passages (do\nnot mean that all works are requited there but) only indicate that the soul\nenjoys in the other world so long as there are works to be enjoyed there?--It\nis impossible to assume this, because elsewhere a reference is made to the\ntotality of works. For the passage, B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 6, 'Having obtained the\nend of whatever deed he does here on earth, he again returns from that world\nto this world to action,' intimates, by means of the comprehensive term\n'whatever,' that all works done here are exhausted there.--Moreover, death has\nthe power of manifesting those works whose fruit has not yet begun 2; the\nmanifestation of those works not being possible previously to death because\nthen they are obstructed by those works whose fruits have already begun. Now\ndeath must manifest alike all works whose fruits had not begun previously,\nbecause the cause being the same the effects cannot be different. Analogously\na lamp which is placed at the same distance from a jar and a piece of cloth\n\np. 114\n\nilluminates the latter as well as the former.--Hence it follows that the souls\ndescend without a remainder of unrequited works.\n\nTo this we reply as follows: 'On the passing away of the works with a\nremainder.' That means: when the aggregate of works with which the souls had\nrisen to the moon for the purpose of the enjoyment of their fruits is, by such\nenjoyment, exhausted, then the body, consisting of water, which had originated\nin the moon for the purpose of such enjoyment, is dissolved by contact with\nthe fire of the grief springing from the observation that the enjoyment comes\nto an end; just as snow and hail are melted by contact with the rays of the\nsun, or the hardness of ghee by contact with the heat of fire. Then, at the\npassing away of the works, i.e. when the works performed, such as sacrifices,\n&c., are, by the enjoyment of their fruits, exhausted, the souls descend with\na remainder yet left.--But on what grounds is that remainder assumed?--On the\nground of what is seen ( _S_ ruti) and Sm _ri_ ti. For scripture declares\nmanifestly that the souls descend joined with such a remainder, 'Those whose\nconduct ( _k_ ara _n_ a) has been good will quickly attain some good birth,\nthe birth of a Brahma _n_ a, or a Kshattriya, or a Vai _s_ ya. But those whose\nconduct has been evil will quickly attain an evil birth, the birth of a dog,\nor a hog, or a _K_ a _n_ _d_ ala.' That the word _k_ ara _n_ a here means the\nremainder (of the works) will be shown later on. Moreover, the different\ndegrees of enjoyment which are implied in the difference of birth on the part\nof the living beings point, as they cannot be accidental, to the existence of\nsuch a remainder of works. For we know from scripture that good fortune as\nwell as misfortune is caused by good and evil works. Sm _ri_ ti also teaches\nthat the members of the different castes and a _s_ ramas do, in accordance\nwith their works, at first enjoy the fruit of their works and then enter into\nnew existences, in which they are distinguished from each other by locality,\ncaste, family, shape, length of life, knowledge, conduct, property, pleasure,\nand intelligence, which doctrine implies that they descend with a remainder of\ntheir works.--Of what kind then is that so-called remainder?--\n\np. 115\n\n[paragraph continues] Some say that thereby we have to understand a remainder\nof the works which had been performed (in the previous existence) for the sake\nof the heavenly world, and whose fruits have (for the greater part) been\nenjoyed. That remainder might then be compared to the remainder of oil which\nsticks to the inside of a vessel previously filled with oil even after it has\nbeen emptied.--But you have no right to assume a remainder in the case of\nworks, the fruits of which have been enjoyed already, since the ad _ri_ sh _t_\na (which springs from works) is opposed to the works (so as to destroy them\ncompletely 1).--This objection, we reply, is not valid, as we do not maintain\nthat the works are completely requited (previously to the new existence).--But\nthe souls do ascend to the sphere of the moon for the express purpose of\nfinding there a complete requital of their works!--True; but when only a\nlittle of the effects of their works is left, they can no longer stay there.\nFor as some courtier who has joined the king's court with all the requisites\nwhich the king's service demands is unable to remain at court any longer, when\nin consequence of his long stay most of his things are worn out, so that he is\nperhaps left with a pair of shoes and an umbrella only; so the soul, when\npossessing only a small particle of the effects of its works, can no longer\nremain in the sphere of the moon.--But all this reasoning is in fact\naltogether unfounded 2. For it has already been stated that, on account of\n(the ad _ri_ sh _t_ a) being opposed to the work, the continued existence of a\nremainder cannot be admitted in the case of works which had been performed\nwith a view to the heavenly world, and which have been requited in the moon.--\nBut has it not also been said above that not all the work whose fruit the\nheavenly world is meets with requital there?--Yes, but that statement is not\ndefensible. For works which are performed for\n\np. 116\n\nthe purpose of obtaining the heaven, world produce their entire heavenly fruit\nfor the soul only as being as it stays in heaven, and if we take our stand on\nscripture we have no right to assume that they produce even a particle of\nfruit for the souls after those have again descended from heaven. That some\npart of the oil continues to remain in the vessel is unobjectionable because\nwe see it, and we likewise see that some part of the courtier's equipment\ncontinues to remain with him; but that some part of those works which led the\nsoul to heaven continues to exist, that we neither see nor are able to\nsurmise, because it would contradict the texts declaring that the heavenly\nworld (alone) is the fruit of the works.--That of works whose fruit is heaven,\nsuch as sacrifices and the like, no remainder continues to exist, we must\nnecessarily acknowledge for the following reason also. If some part of those\ngood works such as sacrifices, &c., on account of which the agents enjoyed the\nheavenly world, were surmised to continue in existence as a remainder, that\nremainder would in all cases be itself a good one, would never be of a\ncontrary nature. But then our supposition would be in conflict with the\nscriptural passage which distinguishes remainders of a different kind, viz.\n'Those whose conduct has been good;--those whose conduct has been evil,' &c.\nHence after the fruits of that set of works which is requited in the other\nworld have been (completely) enjoyed, the remaining other set of works whose\nfruits are to be enjoyed in this world constitutes the so-called anu _s_ aya\nwith which the souls re-descend.--It was said above that we must assume the\nsouls to descend without any such remainder, after having reached, by the\nenjoyment of the fruits, the end of all the works alone here below, on account\nof the comprehensive statement implied in the expression 'whatever.' But that\nassertion cannot be upheld as the existence of such a remainder has been\nproved. Hence we have to understand that the souls re-descend after having\nexhausted, by the enjoyment of its fruits, only that entire part of the works\ndone here below whose fruit belongs to the other world and is begun to be\nenjoyed there.--The proof given by us of the existence of the remainder\nrefutes at the same\n\np. 117\n\ntime the other assertion made above, viz. that death manifests equally all\nworks the enjoyment of whose fruits was not begun here below, and that on that\naccount we are not entitled to draw a line between works whose fruits begin in\nthe other world and works whose fruits begin in this world only (i.e. in a new\nexistence on earth).--We moreover, have to ask for what reason it is\nmaintained that death manifests (i.e. lays open and makes ready for requital\nthose works whose fruits have not begun here below. The answer will be that in\nthis life the operation of certain words cannot begin because it is obstructed\nby other works whose fruits already begin here below, that, however, that\noperation does begin as soon as, at the moment of death, the obstruction\nceases. Well, then, if previously to death those actions whose fruits have\nalready begun prevent other actions from beginning their operation, at the\ntime of death also certain works of less force will be obstructed in their\noperation by other works of greater force, it being impossible that the fruits\nof works of opposite tendency should begin at the same time. For it is\nimpossible to maintain that different deeds whose fruits must be experienced\nin different existences should, merely because they have this in common that\ntheir fruits have not begun (previously to death), become manifest on the\noccasion of one and the same death, and originate one new existence only;\nagainst this militates the fact of the definite fruits (attached to each\nparticular work) being of contrary natures 1. Not, on the other hand, can we\nmaintain that at the time of death some works manifest themselves while others\nare altogether extinguished; for that would contradict the fact that\nabsolutely all works have their fruits. No work in fact can be extinguished\nexcept by means of expiatory actions, &c. 2 Sm _ri_ ti also declares that\nworks whose operation is obstructed\n\np. 118\n\nby other works leading to fruits of a contrary nature last for a long time,\n'Sometimes a good deed persists immovable as it were, the doer meanwhile\nremaining immerged in the sa _m_ sara, until at last he is released from\npain.'\n\nMoreover, if all unrequited works becoming manifest on the occasion of one and\nthe same death were to begin one new existence only, the consequence would be\nthat those who are born again in the heavenly world, or in hell, or as\nanimals, could, as not entitled thereto, perform no religious works, and being\nthus excluded from all chance of acquiring religious merit and demerit could\nnot enter on any new forms of existence, as all reason for the latter would be\nabsent 1. And that would further contradict Sm _ri_ ti, which declares that\nsome single actions, such as the murder of a Brahma _n_ a, are the causes of\nmore than one new existence. Nor can we assume, for the knowledge of the\nparticular results springing from religious merit and demerit, any other cause\nthan the sacred texts 2. Nor, again, does death manifest (bring about the\nrequital of) those works whose fruit is observed to be enjoyed already here\nbelow, as, for instance, the kariresh _t_ i, &c. 3 How then can we allow the\nassumption that death manifests all actions? The instance of the lamp (made\nuse of by the purvapakshin) is already refuted by our having shown the\nrelative strength of actions 4. Or else we may look on the matter as analogous\nto the manifestation (by a lamp) of bigger and smaller objects. For as a lamp,\nalthough equally distant from a big and a very small thing, may manifest the\nformer only\n\np. 119\n\nand not the latter, so death provokes the operation of the stronger works\nonly, not of the weaker ones, although an equal opportunity presents itself\nfor both sets of works as hitherto unrequited.--Hence the doctrine that all\nworks are manifested by death cannot be maintained, as it is contradicted by\n_S_ ruti, Sm _ri_ ti, and reason alike. That the existence of a remainder of\nworks should stand in the way of final release is a misplaced fear, as we know\nfrom _S_ ruti that all works whatever are destroyed by perfect knowledge. It\ntherefore is a settled conclusion that the souls re-descend with a remainder\nof works. They descend 'as they came' (mounted up); 'not thus,' i.e. in\ninverted order. We conclude that they descend 'as they came' from the fact of\nether and smoke, which the text includes in the road of the fathers, being\nmentioned in the description of the descent also, and from the expression 'as\nthey came.' That they follow the inverted order we conclude from night, &c.,\nnot being mentioned, and from the cloud, &c., being added.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[112:2](sbe38084.htm#fr_82) About which term see further on.\n\n[113:1](sbe38084.htm#fr_83) The Comm. on _Kh_.
