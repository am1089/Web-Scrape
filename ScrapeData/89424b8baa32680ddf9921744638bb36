What their parentage?  \nWhat is their size? What beings lend  \nTheir power to guard them and befriend?  \nHow can my son their arts withstand?  \nOr I or all my armed band?  \nTell me the whole that I may know  \nTo meet in war each evil foe  \nWhom conscious might inspires with pride.'  \n\nAnd Vis'vamitra thus replied:  \n'Sprung from Pulastya's race there came  \nA giant known by Ravan's name.  \nOnce favoured by the Eternal Sire  \nHe plagues the worlds in ceaseless ire,  \nFor peerless power and might renowned,  \nBy giant bands encompassed round.  \nVis'ravas for his sire they hold,  \nHis brother is the Lord of Gold.  \nKing of the giant hosts is he,  \nAnd worst of all in cruelty.  \nThis Ravan's dread commands impel  \nTwo demons who in might excel,  \nMaricha and Suvahu hight,  \nTo trouble and impede the rite.'  \n\nThen thus the king addressed the sage:  \n'No power have I, my lord, to wage  \nWar with this evil-minded foe;  \nNow pity on my darling show,  \nAnd upon me of hapless fate,  \nFor thee as God I venerate.  \nGods, spirits, bards of heavenly birth,  2  \nThe birds of air, the snakes of earth  \nBefore the might of Ravan quail,  \nMuch less, can mortal man avail.  \nHe draws, I hear, from out the breast  \n\nThe valour of the mightiest.  \nNo, ne'er can I with him contend,  \nOr with the forces he may send.  \nHow can I then my darling lend,  \nGodlike, unskilled in battle? No,  \nI will not let my young child go.  \nFoes of thy rite, those mighty ones,  \nSunda and Upasunda's sons,  \nAre fierce as Fate to overthrow:  \nI will not let my young child go.  \nMaricha and Suvahu fell  \nAre valiant and instructed well.  \nOne of the twain I might attack.  \nWith all my friends their lord to back.'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[35:1](ry024.htm#fr_143) Consisting of horse, foot, chariots, and elephants.\n\n[35:2](ry024.htm#fr_144) 'The Gandharvas, or heavenly bards, had originally a\nwarlike character but were afterwards reduced to the office of celestial\nmusicians cheering the banquets of the Gods.
