If, untired, he performs three suppressions of his breath according to the\nrule, the sins which he committed during a day and a night are instantly\ndestroyed. 1\n\n2\\. Seated during the evening prayer, he removes by (three) suppressions of\nhis breath all guilt which 2\n\np. 127\n\nhe incurred during the day by deeds, thoughts, or speeches.\n\n3\\. But standing during the morning prayer, he removes by (three) suppressions\nof his breath all guilt which he incurred during the night by deeds, thoughts,\nor speeches.\n\n4\\. But sixteen suppressions of breath, accompanied by (the recitation of) the\nVyah _ri_ tis and the syllable Om, repeated daily, purify after a month even\nthe slayer of a learned Brahma _n_ a. 4\n\n5\\. Even a drinker of spirituous liquor becomes pure, if he mutters the (hymn\nseen) by Kutsa, 'Apa na _h_ sosu _k_ ad agham,' and (the hymn seen) by Vasish\n_th_ a (which begins with the word) 'Prati,' the Mahitra (hymn), and the _S_\nuddhavatis. 5\n\n6\\. Even he who has stolen gold becomes instantly free from guilt, if he once\nmutters (the hymn beginning with the words) 'Asya vamasya' and the _S_ ivasa\n_m_ kalpa. 6\n\n7\\. The violator of a Guru's bed is freed (from sin) if he repeatedly recites\nthe (hymn beginning) 'Havish pantam a _g_ aram' and that (beginning) 'Na tam a\n_m_ ha _h_ ' and mutters the hymn addressed to Purusha. 7\n\n8\\. Or plunging into water he may thrice mutter the Aghamarsha _n_ a. Manu has\ndeclared that the (effect is the) same as if he had gone to bathe at a horse-\nsacrifice. 8\n\np. 128\n\n9\\. An offering consisting of muttered prayers is ten times more efficacious\nthan a sacrifice at which animals are killed; a (prayer) which is inaudible\n(to others) surpasses it a hundred times, and the mental (recitation of sacred\ntexts) one thousand times. 9\n\n10\\. The four Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as and those sacrifices which are enjoined by the\nrules of the Veda are all together not equal in value to the sixteenth part of\na sacrifice consisting of muttered prayers. 10\n\n11\\. But, undoubtedly, a Brahma _n_ a reaches the highest goal by muttering\nprayers only; whether he perform other (rites) or neglect them, he is called a\nBrahma _n_ a who befriends all creatures (maitra). 11\n\n12\\. The sins of those who are intent on muttering prayers, of those who offer\nburnt-oblations, of those who are given to meditation, of those who reside in\nsacred places, and of those who have bathed after performing the vows called\n_S_ iras, do not remain. 12\n\n13\\. As a fire, fanned by wind, burns brighter, and (as its flame grows)\nthrough offerings (of butter), even so a Brahma _n_ a who is daily engaged in\n\np. 129\n\nmuttering sacred texts shines with a brilliant lustre.\n\n14\\. The destruction of those who fulfil the duty of daily study, who\nconstantly restrain themselves, who mutter prayers and offer sacrifices has\nnever been known (to happen). 14\n\n15\\. Let him who is desirous of purification repeat, though he be charged with\nall sins, the divine (Gayatri), at the most one thousand times, or one hundred\ntimes as a medium (penance), or at least ten times (for trivial faults).\n\n16\\. A Kshatriya shall pass through misfortunes which have befallen him by the\nstrength of his arms, a Vai _s_ ya and _S_ udra by their wealth, the highest\namong twice-born men by muttered prayers and burnt-oblations.\n\n17\\. As horses (are useless) without a chariot, as chariots (are useless)\nwithout horses, even so austerity (is useless) to him who is destitute of\nsacred learning, and sacred learning to him who practises no austerities.\n\n18\\. As food mixed with honey, or honey mixed with food, even so are\nausterities and learning, joined together, a powerful medicine.\n\n19\\. No guilt taints a Brahma _n_ a who possesses learning, practises\nausterities, and daily mutters sacred texts, though he may constantly commit\nsinful acts.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[126:1](sbe1429.htm#fr_679) **XXVI**. The verb dharayet, 'performs,' seems to\nbe used in order to indicate that, according to the Yoga _s_ astra, three Pra\n_n_ ayamas make one Dhara _n_ a; see Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 201.\n\n[126:2](sbe1429.htm#fr_680)-3.

The Vedic texts\nmentioned are Rig-veda I, 97, 1; VII, 80 X, 185; VIII, 84., 7-9.\n\n[127:6](sbe1429.htm#fr_683) Manu LI, 251. The Vedic texts alluded to are Rig-\nveda I, 164; and an Upanishad.\n\n[127:7](sbe1429.htm#fr_684) Identical with Manu XI, 252. The Vedic texts\nmentioned are Rig-veda X, 88; X, 126; X,,90.\n\n[127:8](sbe1429.htm#fr_685) Manu XI, 260--261; Vish _n_ u LV, 7.\n\n[128:9](sbe1429.htm#fr_686) Manu II, 85; Vish _n_ u LV, 19. The term arambhaya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, translated by 'an offering at which animals are slain,' is taken by\nK _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita to mean pathaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, 'an offering\nconsisting of Vedic mantras recited aloud.' The word may be taken in several\nways, but the various reading vidhiya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a in Manu's verse induces me to\nadopt the translation given above.\n\n[128:10](sbe1429.htm#fr_687) Identical with Manu II, 86, and Vish _n_ u LV,\n20. Regarding the four Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as, see Professor Jolly's note on Vish\n_n_ u. In my opinion the four classes of rites huta, ahuta, prahuta, and pra\n_s_ ita are meant.\n\n[128:11](sbe1429.htm#fr_688) Identical with Manu II, 87.\n\n[128:12](sbe1429.htm#fr_689) 'After performing the vows (called) _S_ iras,'\ni.e. those which are known in the Upanishads, which are called agnidhara _n_ a\nand so forth, and whose head ( _s_ iras) consists in the worship of the\nteacher: K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita.
