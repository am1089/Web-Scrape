Having returned to the (Garhapatya 1) in order to take forward the\nfire, he offers oblations, and puts on pieces of firewood. For now that Agni\nwas about to go forward (to the fire-altar), the gods regaled him with food,\nboth with oblations and pieces of firewood; and in like manner does this\n(Sacrificer), now that he (Agni) is about to go forward, regale him with food,\nboth with oblations and pieces of firewood. He takes (ghee) in five ladlings:\nthe meaning of this has been explained.\n\np. 189\n\n9:2:2:22\\. He then takes (ghee) in sixteen ladlings 1,--Pra _g_ apati consists\nof sixteen parts, and Pra _g_ apati is Agni: he thus regales him with food\nproportionate to his body; and the food which is proportionate to the body\nsatisfies and does no injury; but that which is excessive does injury, and\nthat which is too little does not satisfy. He takes (the oblations) in the\nsame offering-ladle, for one and the same (Agni) is he whom he regales\ntherewith. With two (verses) addressed to Vi _s_ vakarman he offers; for this\nAgni is Vi _s_ vakarman (the all-worker): it is him he thereby gratifies.\nThree oblations he offers,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great\nas is his measure, with so much food he thus regales him.\n\n9:2:2:33\\. He then puts on the pieces of firewood: this is as if, after\nregaling some one, one were to attend upon him. They are of udumbara (ficus\nglomerata) wood; for the Udumbara is food and sap: with food and sap he thus\nregales him. They are fresh (green), for that part of trees which is fresh is\nuninjured and living: he thus regales him with what is uninjured and living in\ntrees. They are soaked in ghee; for ghee is sacred to Agni: with his own\nportion, with his own sap he thus regales him. They remain the whole night in\nit, for there they become imbued with sap. Three pieces of wood he puts on,--\nthreefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so\nmuch food he thus regales him.\n\n9:2:2:44\\. And; again, as to why he offers those oblations;--now that he\n(Agni) was about to go forward,\n\np. 190\n\nthe gods restored (recruited) him beforehand with food, with these oblations;\nand in like manner does this (Sacrificer), now that he (Agni) is about to go\nforward, restore him beforehand with food, with these oblations.\n\n9:2:2:55\\. He takes (ghee) in five ladlings, for fivefold divided is that\nvital air in the head,--the mind, speech, the breath, the eye, and the ear,--\nhe thus lays that fivefold divided vital air into this head. [He offers it,\nwith, Va _g_. S. XVII, 16], 'Agni, with sharp flame, (may destroy every demon!\nAgni gaineth wealth for us)' thus with a (verse) containing (the word)\n'sharp': he therewith sharpens his head so as to become sharp.\n\n9:2:2:66\\. He then takes (ghee) in sixteen ladlings: eight vital airs, and\neight limbs 1,--this (the symbolical) amount. He takes it in the same spoon,\nfor, indeed, the vital airs and the limbs are in the same body. Separately 2\nhe offers: he thereby makes a distinction between the vital airs and the\nlimbs. With two (verses) addressed to Vi _s_ vakarman he offers: Vi _s_\nvakarman is this Agni, it is him he thus puts together. Three oblations he\noffers,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure,\nwith so much food he thus restores him. With seventeen verses (he offers) 3,--\nPra _g_ apati is seventeenfold, and Pra _g_ apati is Agni: as great as Agni\nis, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus restores him.\n\np. 191\n\n[paragraph continues] With (ghee) taken in twenty-one ladlings (he offers the\ntwo oblations),--there are twelve months, five seasons, these three worlds,\nand yonder sun as the twenty-first: this is the (symbolical) amount (or,\ncorrespondence).\n\n9:2:2:77\\. And, again, as to why he puts the pieces of firewood on; the gods\nhaving set him up wholly and completely, now regaled him with this food, these\npieces of firewood; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), now that he has\nset him up wholly and completely, regale him with this food, these pieces of\nfirewood. They are of udumbara wood, and fresh, and remain for a whole night\n(being) soaked in ghee: the significance of this has been explained. [He puts\nthem on, with, Va _g_. S. XVII, 50-52], 'Upwards lead thou him, O Agni! . . .\nForward lead thou him, O Indra! . . . In whose house we make offering . . .,'\nas the text, so the meaning. Three pieces of firewood he puts on,--threefold\nis Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much food he\nthus regales him. Three oblations he offers,--that makes six: the significance\nof this has been explained.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[188:1](sbe4333.htm#fr_323) That is, the newly-built Garhapatya-hearth (part\niii, p. 302) on which the Ukhya fire has been deposited.\n\n[189:1](sbe4333.htm#fr_324) That is, he ladles sixteen sruva-spoonfuls of ghee\ninto the sru _k_ or offering-ladle.\n\n[190:1](sbe4333.htm#fr_325) Viz. the upper and fore-arms, the thighs and legs.\n\n[190:2](sbe4333.htm#fr_326) That is, he offers this ladleful (obtained by\nsixteen ladlings with the dipping-spoon) in two separate libations (ahuti) or,\naccording to Katy., in two halves.\n\n[190:3](sbe4333.htm#fr_327) Viz.
