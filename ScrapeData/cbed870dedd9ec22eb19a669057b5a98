Charm against kshetriya, hereditary disease.\n\n1\\. From kshetriya (inherited disease), from Nirriti (the goddess of\ndestruction), from the curse of the kinswoman, from Druh (the demon of guile),\nfrom the fetter of Varuna do I release thee. Guiltless do I render thee\nthrough my charm; may heaven and earth both be propitious to thee!  \n2\\. May Agni together with the waters be auspicious to thee, may Soma together\nwith the plants be auspicious. Thus from kshetriya, from Nirriti, from the\ncurse of the kinswoman, from the Druh, from the fetter of Varuna do I release\nthee. Guiltless do I render thee through my charm; may heaven and earth both\nbe propitious to thee!  \nMay the wind in the atmosphere auspiciously bestow upon thee strength, may the\nfour quarters of the heaven be auspicious to thee. Thus from kshetriya, from\nNirriti &c.  \n4\\. These four goddesses, the directions of space, the consorts of the wind,\nthe sun surveys. Thus from kshetriya, from Nirriti &c.  \n5\\. Within these (directions) I assign thee to old age; forth to a distance\nshall go Nirriti and disease! Thus from kshetriya, from Nirriti &c.  \n6\\. Thou hast been released from disease, from mishap, and from blame; out\nfrom the fetter of Druh, and from Grahi (the demon of fits) thou hast been\nreleased. Thus from kshetriya, from Nirriti &c.  \n7\\. Thou didst leave behind Arati (the demon of grudge), didst obtain\nprosperity, didst enter the happy world of the pious. Thus from kshetriya,\nfrom Nirriti &c.  \n8\\. The gods, releasing the sun and the ritam (the divine order of the\nuniverse) from darkness and from Grahi, did take them out of sin. Thus from\nkshetriya, from Nirriti &c.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 7. Charm against kshetriya, hereditary disease](av023.htm)\n\n'
