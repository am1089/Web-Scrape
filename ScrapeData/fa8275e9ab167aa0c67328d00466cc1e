'Place this salt in water, and then wait on me in the morning.'\n\nThe son did as he was commanded.\n\nThe father said to him: 'Bring me the salt, which you placed in the water last\nnight.'\n\np. 105\n\nThe son having looked for it, found it not, for, of course, it was melted.\n\n2\\. The father said: 'Taste it from the surface of the water. How is it?'\n\nThe son replied: 'It is salt.'\n\n'Taste it from the middle. How is it?'\n\nThe son replied: 'It is salt.'\n\n'Taste it from the bottom. How is it?'\n\nThe son replied 'It is salt.'\n\nThe father said Throw it away 1 and then wait on me.'\n\nHe did so; but salt exists for ever.\n\nThen the father said: 'Here also, in this body, forsooth, you do not perceive\nthe True (Sat), my son; but there indeed it is.\n\n3\\. 'That which is the subtile essence, in it all that exists has its self. It\nis the True. It is the Self, and thou, O _S_ vetaketu, art it.'\n\n'Please, Sir, inform me still more,' said the son.\n\n'Be it so, my child,' the father replied.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[104:1](sbe01130.htm#fr_293) The question which the son is supposed to have\nasked is How can this universe which has the form and name of earth &c. be\nproduced from the Sat which is subtile, and has neither form nor name?\n\n[104:2](sbe01131.htm#fr_294) The question here is supposed to have been: If\nthe Sat is the root of all that exists, why is it not perceived?\n\n[105:1](sbe01131.htm#fr_295) Read abhiprasya, which is evidently intended by\nthe commentary: abhiprasya paritya _g_ ya.
