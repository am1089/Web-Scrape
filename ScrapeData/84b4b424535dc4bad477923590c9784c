Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus I have described the glory of the Devi. Now\nI will narrate, as far as I can, the excellent lives of the kings of the the\nSolar and the Lunar dynasties respectively. They\n\n\n\np. 693\n\n\n\nall attained their excellent glories, simply because they were favoured by the\nGrace of the Highest S\xc2\x92akti; they were all the great devotees of the Supreme\nDeity. All their prowess, bravery, prosperity and all their glory, know that\nthose all were derived from the mere parts of the Para S\xc2\x92akti. O King! Those\nKings and others as well were able to out off the Tree of this World by the\nAxe of their Knowledge, simply because they were the devotees of the Para\nS\xc2\x92akti. So with all the care possible, the Lady of the Universe is to be\nworshipped and served. Men should avoid worshipping any other gods, as people\navoid the husk to get the grain inside. O King! By churning the ocean of the\nVedas, I have got the jewel as the lotus-feet of the Para S\xc2\x92akti; and I think\nthat I have discharged all my duties and think myself satisfied and\nsuccessful. Brahma, Vi _sn_ u Rudra, and Is\xc2\x92vara are the four feet and Sada\nS\xc2\x92iva is the plank overhead; thus these five form the seat on which the Devi\nis seated. There is no other deity superior to Her. To show this (to the\nordinary ignorant people) the Maha Devi has taken this seat composed of the\nfive Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, Rudra, Is\xc2\x92vara and Sada S\xc2\x92iva. Superior to these five,\nwhat is stated in the Vedas as Vyaktam and in which all this Universe is sewn,\nas it were, crosswise and lengthwise, lying in and through, that is\nBhuvanes\xc2\x92vari, the Goddess of the Universe.\n\n\n\n[Note: Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, Rudra, Is\xc2\x92vara and Sada S\xc2\x92iva are the Regents or the\npresiding Deities of earth, water, fire, air and \xc3\x82kas\xc2\x92a]. No man can be free\nunless he until the Goddess. When men will be able to encircle the \xc3\x82kas\xc2\x92a, of\nthe fourth dimension, as if it were an antelope skin, then they will be able\nto root out the miseries of the world, without knowing the nature of the Devi\n(i.e., impossible). Thus the S\xc2\x92vetas\xc2\x92vataropani _s_ ada says :-- \xc2\x93Those that\nwere engaged in meditation, Dhyana Yoga, they saw the Devi covered by the Gu\n_n_ as Sattva, Rajas and Tamas and the forces incarnate respectively of the\nseveral Devas.\xc2\x94 So to make the human birth a success, first avoid all\ncompanies, be it out of shame, or fear, or devotion, or out of love; then\nbring the mind and keep it steady in your heart and then be devoted to Her and\nconsider Her as the Supreme. This is the Vedanta Dindima (the declaration of\nthe Vedanta). Whoever takes the name of the Devi, either in sleeping, going or\nresting or in any other condition, he is certainly freed from the bondage of\nthe world, no doubt. O King! So worship the Mahes\xc2\x92vari with all the care that\nyou can. Go on step by step; first worship Her Vira _t_ Rupa (cosmic form);\nthen Suk _s_ ma Rupa (subtle form) and then her Antaryami Rupa (inner form,\nruling within). Thus when your heart is purified, worship the Para S\xc2\x92akti, of\nthe nature of Brahma, beyond this Maya, this Prapa _n_ cha Ullasa, of the\nnature of Existence,\n\n\n\np. 694\n\n\n\nIntelligence and Bliss. When the Chitta (heart) melts in Para S\xc2\x92akti, then\ncomes the real \xc3\x82radhana (the real worship). So dilute your heart in Her. O\nKing! Thus I have described to you the sanctifying deeds of the extremely\ndevoted kings of the Para S\xc2\x92akti, who were noble minded and religious. One who\nwill hear this will acquire fame, dharma, intelligence, good end, and merits\nthat have no equal. Now what else do you like to hear?\n\n\n\n20-22. Janamejaya said :-- \xc2\x93O Bhagavan! In olden times, the World mother Para\nS\xc2\x92akti handed over Gauri to Hara, Lak _s_ mi to Hari, and Sarasvati to Brahma,\nborn of the lotus from the navel of Hari. Now I hear that Gauri is the\ndaughter of Himalaya as well of Dak _s_ a; and Maha Lak _s_ mi is the daughter\nof the K _s_ iroda ocean (ocean of milk). They were all originated from the\nPrime Devi; how, then, Gauri and Lak _s_ mi came to be the daughters of\nothers? O great Muni! This is next to impossible; so my doubt arises. O\nBhagavan! You are quite competent to cut off all my doubts; so by your axe of\nknowledge, cut off my present doubt.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n23-44. Veda Vyasa said :-- O King! Hear. I am telling you this wonderful\nsecret. You are greatly devoted to the Devi; so nothing there can be that I\ncannot disclose to you. Since the time the Great Mother gave over to Hara,\nHari and Brahma, Gauri, Lak _s_ mi and and Sarasvati, respectively, these\nthree Devas, Hara, etc. were performing their tasks, preserving, etc. O King!\nOnce on a time, certain Danavas, named Halahalas were born. In time, they\nbecame very powerful and in a short time conquered the three worlds. What more\nthan this, that they being elated with the boon granted to them by Brahma,\ntook their forces and invested the Mount Kailas\xc2\x92a and the Vaiku _nt_ ha\nregions!\n\n\n\nSeeing this, Maha Deva and Vi _sn_ u both made preparations for war. A\nterrible fight ensued between both the parties. For sixty thousand years the\nbattle lasted incessantly but the result was stalemate. Gradually there was a\ngreat cry of consternation in the two parties. When S\xc2\x92iva and Vi _sn_ u with\ngreat effort destroyed the Danavas. O King! S\xc2\x92iva and Vi _sn_ u then returned\nto their own houses and began to brag of their powers before their own S\xc2\x92aktis\nGauri and Lak _s_ mi; whereas the Demons were killed on account of the S\xc2\x92aktis\nof Gauri and Lak _s_ mi. Seeing them boast, Gauri and Lak _s_ mi laughed not\nsincerely whereon the two gods were very much angry. They under the magic\nspell of the Prime Maya insulted them and even used offensive languages. Gauri\nand Lak _s_ mi quitted them and disappeared. A great uproar then arose in the\nworlds.\n\n\n\np. 695\n\n\n\nBoth Hari and Hara became lustreless due to their insulting the two S\xc2\x92aktis.\nThey become powerless and unconscious and turned out mad. Seeing this Brahma\nbecame very anxious. Hari and Hara are the two chief Deities; how then these\ntwo have become unable to perform the actions of the world! What is the cause?\nWhy this calamity has sprung up out of season? Will there be a Pralaya (a\ngeneral dissolution) of the world out of some offence, when no actions are\nbeing done! I know nothing about this. So how can I find a remedy! Being thus\nvery distressed, he began to meditate with his eyes closed in the fourth\ndimensional space in the heart. O King! The Lotus born Brahma then found out\nby his meditation that this calamity was brought about by the great wrath of\nthe Para S\xc2\x92akti. He then tried to find out the remedy until Hari and Hara did\nnot regain the former natural position. Brahma began by his own S\xc2\x92akti to\ncarry on the functions of them both, viz., that of preservation and\ndestruction for some time. The religious-minded Prajapati quickly called his\nson Manu and Sanaka, etc., the Ri _s_ is, for bringing peace on the two great\nGods! When they came to him, the great ascetic four-faced Brahma told them :--\n\xc2\x93I am now busy with many more works; so I am unable carry on my tapasya? By\nthe wrath of the Highest Force, Hari and Hara have become somewhat distracted;\nso for the satisfaction of the Para S'akti I am performing the three\nfunctions, i.e., those of Creation, Preservation and Destruction. So you both\npractise this hard tapasya with the greatest devotion and bring about Her\nsatisfaction. O sons! Do such as Hari and Hara gain their former states and\nthen be united with their own S\xc2\x92aktis respectively. Your fame will increase\nthereby, no doubt. Rather that family where the two S\xc2\x92aktis will take their\nbirth, will purify the whole world and that man himself will be crowned with\nsuccess.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n45\\. Vyasa said :-- O King! The pure-hearted Dak _s_ a and other mind-born\nsons of Brahma, hearing the words of the Grandsire expressed their desire to\nworship the Para S\xc2\x92akti and went to the forest.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-ninth Chapter of the Seventh Book on birth of the\nBhagavati in the house of Dak _s_ a in the Mahapura _n_ am S'ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam, of 18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 30](bk07ch30.htm)\n\n"
