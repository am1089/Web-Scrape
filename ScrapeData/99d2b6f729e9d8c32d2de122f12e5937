 \nLet cares of state each mind engage  \nTo guard his royal heritage.  \nA monarch from his throne expelled  \nNo better than the dead is held.  \n\nSo he who cares for power and might  \nMust guard his realm and royal right.  \nSuch care a meed in heaven will bring  \nBetter than rites and offering.  \nSuch care a king his country owes  \nAs man upon himself bestows,  \nWhen for his body he provides  \nRaiment and every need besides.  \nFor future days should kings foresee,  \nAnd keep the present error-free.  \n\nThus did the king the kings exhort:  \nThey heard, and turned them from the court  \nAnd, each to each in friendship bound,  \nWent forth to all the realms around.  \nThe rites were o'er, the guests were sped:  \nThe train the best of Brahmans led,  \nIn which the king with joyful soul,  \nWith his dear wives, and with the whole  \nOf his imperial host and train  \nOf cars and servants turned again,  \nAnd, as a monarch dear to fame,  \nWithin his royal city came.  \n\nNext, Rishyas'ring, well-honoured sage,  \nAnd S'anta, sought their hermitage.  \nThe king himself, of prudent mind,  \nAttended him, with troops behind.  \nAnd all her men the town outpoured  \nWith Saint Vas'ishtha and their lord.  \nHigh mounted on a car of state,  \nO'ercanopied fair S'anta sate,  \nDrawn by white oxen, while a band  \nOf servants marched on either hand.  \nGreat gifts of countless price she bore,  \nWith sheep and goats and gems in shore.  \nLike Beauty's self the lady shone  \nWith all the jewels she had on,  \nAs, happy in her sweet content.  \nPeerless amid the fair she went.  \nNot Queen Paulomi's  1b self could be  \nMore loving to her lord than she.  \nShe who had lived in happy ease,  \nHonoured with all her heart could please,  \nWhile dames and kinsfolk ever vied  \nTo see her wishes gratified,  \nSoon as she knew her husband's will  \nAgain to seek the forest, still  \nWas ready for the hermit's cot,  \nNor murmured at her altered lot.  \nThe king attended to the wild  \nThat hermit and his own dear child,  \nAnd in the centre of a throng  \nOf noble courtiers rode along.  \nThe sage's son had let prepare  \nA lodge within the wood, and there  \nWhile they lingered blithe and gay.  \nThen, duly honoured, went their way.  \nThe glorious hermit Rishyas'ring  \nDrew near and thus besought the king:  \n\np. 30  \n\n'Return, my honoured lord, I pray,  \nReturn, upon thy homeward way.'  \nThe monarch, with the waiting crowd,  \nLifted his voice and wept aloud,  \nAnd with eyes dripping still to each  \nOf his good queens he spake this speech:  \n\n'Kaus'alya and Sumitra dear,  \nAnd thou, my sweet Kaikeyi, hear.  \nAll upon S'anta feast your gaze,  \nThe last time for a length of days.'  \nTo S'anta's arms the ladies leapt,  \nAnd hung about her neck and wept,  \nAnd cried, '0, happy be the life  \nOf this great Brahman and his wife.  \nThe Wind, the Fire, the Moon on high.  \nThe Earth, the Streams, the circling sky,  \nPreserve thee in the wood, true spouse,  \nDevoted to thy husband's vows.  \nAnd O dear S'anta, ne'er neglect  \nTo pay the dues of meek respect  \nTo the great saint, thy husband's sire,  \nWith all observance and with fire.  \nAnd, sweet one, pure of spot and blame,  \nForget not thou thy husband's claim;  \nIn every change, in good and ill,  \nLet thy sweet words delight him still,  \nAnd let thy worship constant be:  \nHer lord is woman's deity.  \nTo learn thy welfare, dearest friend,  \nThe king will many a Brahman send.  \nLet happy thoughts thy spirit cheer.  \nAnd be not troubled, daughter dear.'  \n\nThese soothing words the ladies said.  \nAnd pressed their lips upon her head.  \nEach gave with sighs her last adieu,  \nThen at the king's command withdrew.  \nThe king around the hermit went  \nWith circling footsteps reverent,  \nAnd placed at Rishyas'ring's command  \nSome soldiers of his royal band.  \nThe Brahman bowed in turn and cried,  \n'May fortune never leave thy side.  \nO mighty King, with justice reign,  \nAnd still thy people's love retain.'  \nHe spoke, and turned away his face,  \n   And, as the hermit went,  \nThe monarch, rooted to the place,  \n   Pursued with eyes intent.  \nBut when the sage had past from view  \nKing Das'aratha turned him too,  \nStill fixing on his friend each thought.  \nWith such deep love his breast was fraught.  \nAmid his people's loud acclaim  \nHome to his royal seat he came,  \n   And lived delighted there,  \nExpecting when each queenly dame,  \nUpholder of his ancient fame,  \n   Her promised son should bear.  \nThe glorious sage his way pursued  \nTill close before his eyes he viewed  \nSweet Champa, Lomapad's fair town,  \nWreathed with her Champacs' [1](ry020.htm#fn_125) leafy crown.  \nSoon as the saint's approach he knew,  \nThe king, to yield him honour due,  \nWent forth to meet him with a band  \nOf priests and nobles of the land:  \n'Hail, Sage,' he cried, 'O joy to me!  \nWhat bliss it is, my lord, to see  \nThee with thy wife and all thy train  \nReturning to my town again.  \nThy father, honoured Sage, is well,  \nWho hither from his woodland cell  \nHas sent full many a messenger  \nFor tidings both of thee and her.'  \nThen joyfully, for due respect,  \nThe monarch bade the town be decked.  \nThe king and Rishyas'ring elate  \nEntered the royal city's gate:  \n   In front the chaplain rode.  \nThen, loved and honoured with all care  \nBy monarch and by courtier, there  \n   The glorious saint abode.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[29:1](ry018.htm#fr_123) This Canto will appear ridiculous to the European\nreader. But it should be remembered that the monkeys of an Indian forest, the\n'bough-deer' as the poets call them, are very different animals from the\n'turpissima bestia' that accompanies the itinerant organ-grinder or grins in\nthe Zoological Gardens of London. Milton has made his hero, Satan, assume the\nforms of a cormorant, a toad, and a serpent, and I cannot see that this\ncreation of semi-divine Vanars, or monkeys, is more ridiculous or undignified.\n\n[29:1b](ry019.htm#fr_124) The consort of Ladra, called also S'achi and\nIndrani.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XVIII.: Rishyas'ring's Departure.](ry020.htm)\n\n"
