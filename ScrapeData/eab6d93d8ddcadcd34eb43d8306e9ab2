He saw this\nbird-like body, the Fire-altar: he\n\np. 286\n\nfashioned it, and thereby gained this (terrestrial) world. He saw a second\nbird-like body, the (chant of the) Great Rite 1: he fashioned it, and thereby\ngained the air. He saw a third bird-like body, the Great Litany 1: he\nfashioned it, and thereby gained the sky.\n\n10:1:2:22\\. This built Fire-altar, doubtless, is this (terrestrial) world, the\nGreat Rite the air, and the Great Litany the sky: all these, the Fire-altar,\nthe Great Rite, and the Great Litany, one ought therefore to undertake\ntogether, for these worlds were created together; and as to why the Fire-altar\nis built first, it is because of these worlds this (terrestrial) one was\ncreated first. Thus with regard to the deity.\n\n10:1:2:33\\. Now with regard to the body. The Fire-altar is the mind, the\n(chant of the) Great Rite the breath, and the Great Litany speech: all these\none ought therefore to undertake together, for mind, breath, and speech belong\ntogether; as to why the Fire-altar is built first, it is because the mind is\nprior to the breathings.\n\n10:1:2:44\\. The Fire-altar, indeed, is the body (trunk), the Great Rite the\nbreath, and the Great Litany speech: all these one ought therefore to\nundertake together, for body, breath, and speech belong together; and as to\nwhy the Fire-altar is built first, it is because of him who is produced the\ntrunk is produced first.\n\n10:1:2:55\\. The Fire-altar, indeed, is the head, the Great Rite the breath,\nand the Great Litany the body:\n\np. 287\n\none ought therefore to undertake all these together, for head, breath, and\nbody belong together; and as to why the Fire-altar is built first, it is\nbecause of him who is born the head is born first; and hence, whenever all\nthese are undertaken together the Great Litany, indeed, is accounted the\nhighest (atamam) 1, for the Great Litany is the body (or self, atman).\n\n10:1:2:66\\. As to this they say, 'If all these are difficult to obtain\ntogether, what (means of) obtaining them is there?'--In the _G_ yotish _t_ oma\n(form of the) Agnish _t_ oma 2: let him perform offering with the _G_ yotish\n_t_ oma Agnish _t_ oma.\n\n10:1:2:77\\. In this _G_ yotish _t_ oma Agnish _t_ oma the Bahishpavamana\n(stotra) is (in) the Triv _ri_ t (stoma)--that is the head of the rite; the\ntwo other Pavamanas are (in) the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a and Saptada _s_ a\n(stomas)--they are the two wings; the Hot _ri_ 's\n\np. 288\n\n[paragraph continues] \xc3\x82 _g_ ya (stotra) is (in) the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a, the\nP _ri_ sh _th_ a (stotra in) the Saptada _s_ a, and the Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ aya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\niya (stotra in) the Ekavi _m_ _s_ a (stoma)--they are the tail.\n\n10:1:2:88\\. Now these two, the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a and Saptada _s_ a, have\nthirty-two hymn-verses: twenty-five of these are the twenty-five-fold body 1;\nand the seven which remain over are the Parimad (samans), for these are the\ncattle (or animals), (for) cattle are sporting all around us (pari-mad\n2)--thus much, then, is the\n\np. 289\n\n[paragraph continues] Great Rite: thereby he obtains the Great Rite even in\nthis (Agnish _t_ oma).\n\n10:1:2:99\\. And the Hot _ri_ recites seven metres--each subsequent one-versed\n(metre) increasing by four (syllables)--with the Vira _g_ as an eighth: these\n(eight) consist of three eighties and forty-five syllables. Now by the\neighties thereof the eighties (of the mahad uktham) 1 are obtained, for the\nGreat Litany is counted (or recited) by eighties (of triplets); and of the\nforty-five (syllables which remain) twenty-five are this twenty-five-fold body\n2; and where the body is there, indeed, are (included) the head, and the wings\nand tail; and the twenty (syllables which remain) are the insertion 3;--thus\nmuch, then, is the Great Litany: thereby he obtains the Great Litany even in\nthis (Agnish _t_ oma). All these (three) are indeed obtained in the _G_ yotish\n_t_ oma Agnish _t_ oma: let him, therefore, perform offering with the _G_\nyotish _t_ oma Agnish _t_ oma.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[285:1](sbe4345.htm#fr_537) Viz. inasmuch as the altar is built on the earth,\nand the latter forms its foundation. Comm.\n\n[286:1](sbe4346.htm#fr_539) The Mahavrata-saman and the Mahad uktham, as we\nhave seen ([p. 282](sbe4345.htm#page_282), note [5](sbe4345.htm#fn_525); [p.\n111](sbe4324.htm#page_111), note [1](sbe4324.htm#fn_203)), are constructed so\nas to correspond to the different parts of the bird-like Agni-Pra _g_ apati.\n\n[287:1](sbe4346.htm#fr_540) The combination 'atama _m_ khyayate' is, as it\nwere, the superlative of 'a-khyayate;' cf. anutama _m_ gopayati, [X, 5, 2,\n10](sbe4367.htm#10:5:2:10); and Delbruck, Altind. Syntax, p. 194.\n\n[287:2](sbe4346.htm#fr_541) The Agnish _t_ oma may be performed in three\ndifferent modes, according to the variation of stomas (or hymn-forms) employed\nfor the stotras (or chants). In the _G_ yotish _t_ oma the order of stomas is\nthat set forth in [paragraph 7](sbe4346.htm#10:1:2:7), viz.: a.\nBahishpavamana-stotra in the Triv _ri_ t (nine-versed); b. \xc3\x82 _g_ ya-stotras,\nand c. Madhyandina-pavamana-stotra, in the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a (fifteen-\nversed); d. P _ri_ sh _th_ a-stotras, and e. \xc3\x82rbhava-pavamana-stotra, in the\nSaptada _s_ a (seventeen-versed); and f. Agnish _t_ oma-saman (Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ aya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iya) in the Ekavi _m_ _s_ a (twenty-one-versed) stoma, or hymn-form.\nIn the Gosh _t_ oma, on the other hand, the succession of stomas is a. Pa _\xc3\xb1_\n_k_ ada _s_ a, b. Triv _ri_ t, c. d. Saptada _s_ a, e. f. Ekavi _m_ _s_ a; and\nin the \xc3\x82yush _t_ oma: a. Triv _ri_ t, b. Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a, (c. d.) Saptada\n_s_ a, (e. f.) Ekavi _m_ _s_ a. Cf. part ii, p. 402, note 4; for the scheme of\nStotras (and Sastras), ib. p. 325, note 2. The Agnish _t_ oma is singled out\nhere for the reason that the Mahavrata-day takes the form of an Agnish _t_ oma\nsacrifice.\n\n[288:1](sbe4346.htm#fr_542) See [p. 168](sbe4330.htm#page_168), note\n[3](sbe4330.htm#fn_287).\n\n[288:2](sbe4346.htm#fr_543) Saya _n_ a takes 'parimad' here in the sense of 'a\nsource of pleasure all around'--parito harshahetava _h_.--The Parimada _h_ are\nthirteen Samans sung (not chanted, in the proper sense of the word) by the\nUdgat _ri_ , his two assistants joining merely in the Nidhanas or chorus-like\npassages. They are given, figured for chanting, in the Ara _n_ yagana of the\nSama-veda (Calc. ed., ii, p. 387 seq.). This performance takes place\nimmediately after the Adhvaryu has given the sign for, and the Udgat _ri_\n'yoked,' the Mahavrata-stotra or saman (i. e. the Hot _ri_ 's P _ri_ sh _th_\nastotra of the Great Rite),--or, according to some authorities, before either\nthe 'yoking,' or the Adhvaryu's summons,--and thus serves as an introduction\nto the central and chief element of the Great Rite, the Mahavrata-saman.\nAccording to the ritual symbolism, these preliminary samans are intended to\nsupply the newly completed Pra _g_ apati with hair (feathers) and nails; but\nthe performance would rather seem to he a solemn mode of doing homage\n(upasthanam) to the different parts of the bird-like altar and the sacrificial\nground; thus corresponding to a similar, though simpler, ceremony performed on\nthe completion of the fire-altar in its simplest form, as described at [IX, 1,\n2, 35](sbe4331.htm#9:1:2:35)-[43](sbe4331.htm#9:1:2:43). On the present\noccasion the ceremony is performed in the following order: 1. near the head of\nthe altar (the \xc3\x82havaniya fire) he sings the Pra _n_ a ('breath;' Sama-v., vol.\nii, p. 436); 2. near the tail the Apana (downward-breathing, ii, p. 437); 3.\n4. near the right and left wing the two Vratapakshau (ii, p. 438); 5. near the\nleft armpit the Pra _g_ apati-h _ri_ daya ('heart of Pra _g_.,' ii, p. 499);\n6. near the _K_ atvala or pit, the Vasish _th_ asya Nihava (Sama-v., vol. v,\np. 602); 7. near the \xc3\x82gnidhra hearth the Satrasyarddhi ('success of the\nsacrificial session,' ii, p. 465); 8. 9. in front and behind the Havirdhana\ncarts, the _S_ loka and Anu _s_ loka (i, pp. 887-9); p. 289 10\\. towards the\nMar _g_ aliya the Yama (ii, p. 461); 11. 12. in front and behind the Sadas,\nthe \xc3\x82yus, and Navastobha (ii, pp. 450-51); 13. in front of the Garhapatya the\n_Ri_ _s_ yasya saman (ii, p. 324).\n\n[289:1](sbe4346.htm#fr_544) See [p. 112](sbe4324.htm#page_112), note\n[1](sbe4324.htm#fn_204).\n\n[289:2](sbe4346.htm#fr_545) Viz. the body, as consisting of the ten fingers,\nthe ten toes, the arms and legs, and the trunk.\n\n[289:3](sbe4346.htm#fr_546) Towards the end of the Mahad Uktham, in the\nportion representing the thighs, nine trish _t_ ubh verses ( _Ri_ g-veda III,\n43, 1-8, and X, 55, 5) are inserted as an 'avapanam..'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: X, 1, 3.
