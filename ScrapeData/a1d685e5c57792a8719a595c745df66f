Now when they spread (and perform) the sacrifice, they kill it;\nand when they press out king Soma, they kill him; and when they 'quiet' and\ncut up the victim, they kill it,--it is by means of the mortar and pestle, and\nby the two mill-stones that they kill the Havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a (grain-offering).\n\np. 3\n\n11:1:2:22\\. And having killed the sacrifice, he pours it, as seed, into the\nfire as its womb, for, indeed, the fire is the womb of the sacrifice, from out\nof it it is produced: let him therefore perform those ten oblations 1 for\nwhich the Vasha _t_ is uttered.\n\n11:1:2:33\\. And, indeed, this sacrifice is the blowing (wind): he blows here,\nas it were, as a single one, but when he has entered into man, he is divided\ninto ten parts;--with the vital airs thus distributed, it (the sacrifice) is\nborn from out of its womb, the fire: this is that Vira _g_ of ten syllables,\nthis is that perfection, the sacrifice.\n\n11:1:2:44\\. There may, however, be nine (oblations) 2;--he thus forms a\ndefective (lesser, lower) Vira _g_ with a view to production; for from the\nlesser 3, indeed, creatures are produced here: this is that perfection, the\nsacrifice.\n\n11:1:2:55\\. But there may be one additional (oblation) 4,that one remains over\nfor Pra _g_ apati: this is that perfection, the sacrifice.\n\n11:1:2:66\\. And there may be two additional (oblations) 5,\n\np. 4\n\n[paragraph continues] \\--a productive pair consists of two: thus a productive\npair is produced; this is that perfection, the sacrifice.\n\n11:1:2:77\\. And there may be three additional ones 1,--a productive pair\nconsists of two, and that which is produced is the third: this is that\nperfection, the sacrifice.\n\n11:1:2:88\\. And there may be four additional ones 2,--as the one so the four.\nThere are these three worlds; these worlds he thus gains by three (oblations);\nand Pra _g_ apati, indeed, is the fourth beyond these worlds: by the fourth\n(oblation) he thus gains Pra _g_ apati,--this is that perfection, the\nsacrifice.\n\n11:1:2:99\\. That (sacrifice) which is defective in two (oblations) 3 is indeed\ndefective, it is not a sacrifice; and that which is excessive in respect of\nfive (oblations) is indeed excessive, it is not a sacrifice: this is that\nperfection as regards the ten, the twenty, thus up to a thousand 4.\n\n11:1:2:1010\\. Verily, they who perform the Full and New-moon sacrifice, run a\nrace 5. One ought to perform it during fifteen years;--in these fifteen years\nthere are three hundred and sixty full moons and new\n\np. 5\n\nmoons; and there are in a year three hundred and sixty nights: it is the\nnights he thus gains.\n\n11:1:2:1111\\. He should then offer for another fifteen years; in these fifteen\nyears there are three hundred and sixty full moons and new moons; and there\nare in a year three hundred and sixty days it is the days he thus gains, and\nthe year itself he thus gains.\n\n11:1:2:1212\\. Now, indeed, the gods were at first mortal; and only when they\nhad gained the year they were immortal; for the year is everything, and the\nimperishable means everything: thereby then accrues to him imperishable merit,\nthe imperishable world.\n\n11:1:2:1313\\. He who, knowing this, offers (the Full and New-moon sacrifice)\nfor thirty years, becomes one of the race-runners, whence one ought to offer\nsacrifice for not less than thirty years. But if he be a performer of the\nDakshaya _n_ a sacrifice 1, he need only offer for fifteen years, for therein\nthat perfection is brought about, since he performs (every month) two Full-\nmoon and two New-moon offerings, and thus that perfection is indeed brought\nabout therein.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[3:1](sbe44004.htm#fr_75) These ten oblations of the New and Full-moon\nsacrifice (as the model for Havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as generally), as enumerated by\nSaya _n_ a, are ( _a_ ) at full moon--five fore-offerings, two butter-\nportions, two cake-offerings to Agni, and Agni-Soma, and a low-voiced offering\nto Agni-Soma, ( _b_ ) at new moon--five fore-offerings, two butter-portions, a\ncake to Agni, a low-voiced offering to Vish _n_ u, and an offering of (sweet\nand sour) milk, or Sannayya, to Indra.\n\n[3:2](sbe44004.htm#fr_76) Viz. inasmuch as, according to Saya _n_ a, at the\nFull-moon sacrifice the offering to Agni-Soma only takes place in the case of\none who is a Soma-offerer. I find, however, no authority for this.\n\n[3:3](sbe44004.htm#fr_77) Or, from the lower part (nyuna); cf. II, 1, 1, 13;\n5, I, 20.\n\n[3:4](sbe44004.htm#fr_78) That is, if the oblation to Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t\n(part i, p. 199 seqq.) is taken into account.\n\n[3:5](sbe44004.htm#fr_79) According to Saya _n_ a, the second additional\noffering is the oblation of clotted ghee to Vanaspati (the lord of the forest,\nor p. 4 the tree, i.e. the sacrificial stake, or Soma) at the animal\nsacrifice. Cf. part ii, p. 208.\n\n[4:1](sbe44004.htm#fr_80) These three oblations, according to Saya _n_ a, are\nthe three after-offerings (to the Barhis, to Nara _s_ a _m_ sa, and to Agni),\nsee part i, p. 230 seqq.\n\n[4:2](sbe44004.htm#fr_81) Viz. either the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t and the three\nafter-offerings; or the four Patnisa _m_ ya _g_ as (to Soma, Tvash _t_ _ri_ ,\nthe wives of the gods, and Agni G _ri_ hapati), cf. part i, p. 256 seqq.\n\n[4:3](sbe44004.htm#fr_82) That is, if it includes only eight oblations, see\n[paragraph 4](sbe44004.htm#11:1:2:4).\n\n[4:4](sbe44004.htm#fr_83) That is, counting every ten (oblations) one Vira _g_\n, or metrical pada of ten syllables.\n\n[4:5](sbe44004.htm#fr_84) Viz. running along, as they do, with the revolutions\nof the moon and the sun.\n\n[5:1](sbe44004.htm#fr_85) For this modification of the New and Full-moon\nsacrifice, see part i, p. 374 seqq.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 1, 3.
