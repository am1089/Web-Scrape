(Although there is a conflict of the Vedanta-passages with regard to the\nthings created, such as) ether and so on; (there is no such conflict with\nregard to the Lord) on account of his being represented (in one passage) as\ndescribed (in other passages), viz. as the cause (of the world).\n\nIn the preceding part of the work the right definition of Brahman has been\nestablished; it has been shown that all the Vedanta-texts have Brahman for\ntheir common topic; and it has been proved that there is no scriptural\nauthority for the doctrine of the pradhana.--But now a new objection presents\nitself.\n\nIt is not possible--our opponent says-to prove either that Brahman is the\ncause of the origin, &c. of the world, or that all Vedanta-texts refer to\nBrahman; because we observe that the Vedanta-texts contradict one another. All\nthe Vedanta-passages which treat of the creation enumerate its successive\nsteps in different order, and so in reality speak of different creations. In\none place it is said that from the Self there sprang the ether (Taitt. Up. II,\n1); in another place that the creation began with fire ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 2, 3);\nin another place, again, that the Person created breath and from breath faith\n(Pr. Up. VI, 4); in another place, again, that the Self created these worlds,\nthe water (above the heaven), light, the mortal (earth), and the water (below\nthe earth) (Ait. \xc3\x82r. II, 4, 1, 2; 3). There no order is stated at all.\nSomewhere else it is said that the creation originated from the Non-existent.\n'In the beginning this was non-existent; from it was born what exists' (Taitt.\nUp. II, 7); and, 'In the beginning this was non-existent; it became existent;\nit grew' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 19, 1). In another place,\n\np. 264\n\nagain, the doctrine of the Non-existent being the antecedent of the creation\nis impugned, and the Existent mentioned in its stead. 'Others say, in the\nbeginning there was that only which is not; but how could it be thus, my dear?\nHow could that which is be born of that which is not?' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 2, 1;\n2.) And in another place, again, the development of the world is spoken of as\nhaving taken place spontaneously, 'Now all this was then undeveloped. It\nbecame developed by form and name' (B _ri_. Up. I, 4, 7).--As therefore\nmanifold discrepancies are observed, and as no option is possible in the case\nof an accomplished matter  1, the Vedanta-passages cannot be accepted as\nauthorities for determining the cause of the world, but we must rather accept\nsome other cause of the world resting on the authority of Sm _ri_ ti and\nReasoning.\n\nTo this we make the following reply.--Although the Vedanta-passages may be\nconflicting with regard to the order of the things created, such as ether and\nso on, they do not conflict with regard to the creator, 'on account of his\nbeing represented as described.' That means: such as the creator is described\nin any one Vedanta-passage, viz. as all-knowing, the Lord of all, the Self of\nall, without a second, so he is represented in all other Vedanta-passages\nalso. Let us consider, for instance, the description of Brahman (given in\nTaitt. Up. II, 1 ff.). There it is said at first, 'Truth, knowledge, infinite\nis Brahman.' Here the word 'knowledge,' and so likewise the statement, made\nlater on, that Brahman desired (II, 6), intimate that Brahman is of the nature\nof intelligence. Further, the text declares  2 that the cause of the world is\nthe general Lord, by representing it as not dependent on anything else. It\nfurther applies to the cause of the world the term 'Self (II, 1), and it\nrepresents it as abiding within the series of sheaths beginning\n\np. 265\n\nwith the gross body; whereby it affirms it to be the internal Self within all\nbeings. Again--in the passage, 'May I be many, may I grow forth'--it tells how\nthe Self became many, and thereby declares that the creator is non-different\nfrom the created effects. And--in the passage, 'He created all this whatever\nthere is'--it represents the creator as the Cause of the entire world, and\nthereby declares him to have been without a second previously to the creation.\nThe same characteristics which in the above passages are predicated of\nBrahman, viewed as the Cause of the world, we find to be predicated of it in\nother passages also, so, for instance, 'Being only, my dear, was this in the\nbeginning, one only, without a second. It thought, may I be many, may I grow\nforth. It sent forth fire' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 2, 1; 3), and 'In the beginning all\nthis was Self, one only; there was nothing else blinking whatsoever. He\nthought, shall I send forth worlds?' (Ait. \xc3\x82r. II, 4, 1, 1; 2.) The Vedanta-\npassages which are concerned with setting forth the cause of the world are\nthus in harmony throughout.--On the other hand, there are found conflicting\nstatements concerning the world, the creation being in some places said to\nbegin with ether, in other places with fire, and so on. But, in the first\nplace, it cannot be said that the conflict of statements concerning the world\naffects the statements concerning the cause, i.e. Brahman, in which all the\nVedanta-texts are seen to agree--for that would be an altogether unfounded\ngeneralization;--and, in the second place, the teacher will reconcile later on\n(II, 3) those conflicting passages also which refer to the world. And, to\nconsider the matter more thoroughly, a conflict of statements regarding the\nworld would not even matter greatly, since the creation of the world and\nsimilar topics are not at all what Scripture wishes to teach. For we neither\nobserve nor are told by Scripture that the welfare of man depends on those\nmatters in any way; nor have we the right to assume such a thing; because we\nconclude from the introductory and concluding clauses that the passages about\nthe creation and the like form only subordinate members of passages treating\nof Brahman. That all the passages\n\np. 266\n\nsetting forth the creation and so on subserve the purpose of teaching Brahman,\nScripture itself declares; compare _Kh_. Up. VI, 8, 4, 'As food too is an\noffshoot, seek after its root, viz. water. And as water too is an offshoot,\nseek after its root, viz. fire. And as fire too is an offshoot, seek after its\nroot, viz. the True.' We, moreover, understand that by means of comparisons\nsuch as that of the clay ( _Kh_. Up. VI, i, 4) the creation is described\nmerely for the purpose of teaching us that the effect is not really different\nfrom the cause. Analogously it is said by those who know the sacred tradition,\n'If creation is represented by means of (the similes of) clay, iron, sparks,\nand other things; that is only a means for making it understood that (in\nreality) there is no difference whatever' (Gau _d_ ap. Ka. III, l5).--On the\nother hand, Scripture expressly states the fruits connected with the knowledge\nof Brahman, He who knows Brahman obtains the highest' (Taitt. Up. II, i); 'He\nwho knows the Self overcomes grief' ( _Kh_. Up. VII, i, 3); 'A man who knows\nhim passes over death' ( _S_ ve. Up. III, 8). That fruit is, moreover,\napprehended by intuition (pratyaksha), for as soon as, by means of the\ndoctrine, 'That art thou,' a man has arrived at the knowledge that the Self is\nnon-transmigrating, its transmigrating nature vanishes for him.\n\nIt remains to dispose of the assertion that passages such as 'Non-being this\nwas in the beginning' contain conflicting statements about the nature of the\ncause. This is done in the next Sutra.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[264:1](sbe34125.htm#fr_244) Option being possible only in the case of things\nto be accomplished, i.e. actions.\n\n[264:2](sbe34125.htm#fr_245) According to Go. \xc3\x82n. in the passage, 'That made\nitself its Self (II, 7); according to \xc3\x82n.
