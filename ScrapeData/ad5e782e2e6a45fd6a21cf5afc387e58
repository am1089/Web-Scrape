X, 3); \'All beings abide in me, I abide not in them. Nay, the beings abide\nnot in me--behold my lordly power. My Self bringing forth the beings supports\nthem but does not abide in them\' (Bha. Gi. IX, 4, 5); \'I am the origin and the\ndissolution of the entire world; higher than I there is nothing else: on me\nall this is strung as pearls on a thread\' (Bha. Gi. VII, 6, 7); \'Pervading\nthis entire Universe by a portion (of mine) I abide\' (Bha. Gi. X, 42); \'But\nanother, the highest Person, is called the highest Self who, pervading the\nthree worlds supports them, the eternal Lord. Because I transcend the\nPerishable and am higher than the Imperishable even, I am among the people and\nin the Veda celebrated as the supreme Person\' (Bha. Gi. XV, 17, 18).\n\n\'He transcends the fundamental matter of all beings, its modifications,\nproperties and imperfections; he transcends all investing (obscuring)\ninfluences, he who is the Self of all. Whatever (room) there is in the\ninterstices of the world is filled by him; all auspicious qualities constitute\nhis nature. The whole creation of beings is taken out of a small part of his\npower. Assuming at will whatever form he desires he bestows benefits on the\nwhole world effected by him. Glory, strength, dominion, wisdom, energy, power\nand other attributes are collected in him, Supreme of the supreme in whom no\ntroubles abide, ruler over high and\n\np. 87\n\nlow, lord in collective and distributive form, non-manifest and manifest,\nuniversal lord, all-seeing, all-knowing, all-powerful, highest Lord. The\nknowledge by which that perfect, pure, highest, stainless homogeneous\n(Brahman) is known or perceived or comprehended--that is knowledge: all else\nis ignorance\' (Vish _n_ u Pura _n_ a VI, 5, 82-87).--\'To that pure one of\nmighty power, the highest Brahman to which no term is applicable, the cause of\nall causes, the name "Bhagavat" is suitable. The letter bha implies both the\ncherisher and supporter; the letter ga the leader, mover and creator. The two\nsyllables bhaga indicate the six attributes--dominion, strength, glory,\nsplendour, wisdom, dispassion. That in him--the universal Self, the Self of\nthe beings--all beings dwell and that he dwells in all, this is the meaning of\nthe letter va. Wisdom, might, strength, dominion, glory, without any evil\nqualities, are all denoted by the word bhagavat. This great word bhagavat is\nthe name of Vasudeva who is the highest Brahman--and of no one else. This word\nwhich denotes persons worthy of reverence in general is used in its primary\nsense with reference to Vasudeva only; in a derived sense with regard to other\npersons\' (Vi. Pu. VI, 5, 72 ff.); \'Where all these powers abide, that is the\nform of him who is the universal form: that is the great form of Hari. That\nform produces in its sport forms endowed with all powers, whether of gods or\nmen or animals. For the purpose of benefiting the worlds, not springing from\nwork (karman) is this action of the unfathomable one; all-pervading,\nirresistible\' (Vi. Pu. VI, 7, 69-71); \'Him who is of this kind, stainless,\neternal, all-pervading, imperishable, free from all evil, named Vish _n_ u,\nthe highest abode\' (Vi. Pu. I, 22,53); \'He who is the highest of the high, the\nPerson, the highest Self, founded on himself; who is devoid of all the\ndistinguishing characteristics of colour, caste and the like; who is exempt\nfrom birth, change, increase, decay and death; of whom it can only be said\nthat he ever is. He is everywhere and in him everything abides; hence he is\ncalled Vasudeva by those who know. He is Brahman, eternal, supreme,\nimperishable, undecaying; of one essential nature and ever pure,\n\np. 88\n\nas free from all defects. This whole world is Brahman, comprising within its\nnature the Evolved and the Unevolved; and also existing in the form of the\nPerson and in that of time\' (Vi. Pu. I, 2, 10-14); \'The Prak _ri_ ti about\nwhich I told and which is Evolved as well as Unevolved, and the Person--both\nthese are merged in the highest Self. The highest Self is the support of all,\nthe highest Lord; as Vish _n_ u he is praised in the Vedas and the Vedanta-\ntexts\' (Vi. Pu. VI, 4, 38, 39). \'Two forms are there of that Brahman, one\nmaterial, the other immaterial. These two forms, perishable and imperishable,\nare within all things: the imperishable one is the highest Brahman, the\nperishable one this whole world. As the light of a fire burning in one place\nspreads all around, so the energy of the highest Brahman constitutes this\nentire world\' (Vi. Pu. I, 23,53-55). \'The energy of Vish _n_ u is the highest,\nthat which is called the embodied soul is inferior; and there is another third\nenergy called karman or Nescience, actuated by which the omnipresent energy of\nthe embodied soul perpetually undergoes the afflictions of worldly existence.\nObscured by Nescience the energy of the embodied soul is characterised in the\ndifferent beings by different degrees of perfection\' (Vi. Pu. VI, 7, 61-63).\n\nThese and other texts teach that the highest Brahman is essentially free from\nall imperfection whatsoever, comprises within itself all auspicious qualities,\nand finds its pastime in originating, preserving, reabsorbing, pervading, and\nruling the universe; that the entire complex of intelligent and non-\nintelligent beings (souls and matter) in all their different estates is real,\nand constitutes the form, i.e. the body of the highest Brahman, as appears\nfrom those passages which co-ordinate it with Brahman by means of terms such\nas _s_ arira (body), rupa (form), tanu (body), a _m_ sa. (part), _s_ akti\n(power), vibhuti (manifestation of power), and so on;--that the souls which\nare a manifestation of Brahman\'s power exist in their own essential nature,\nand also, through their connexion with matter, in the form of embodied souls\n(kshetra _g \xc3\xb1_a);--and that the embodied souls, being engrossed by Nescience\nin the form of good and evil works, do not recognise their\n\np. 89\n\nessential nature, which is knowledge, but view themselves as having the\ncharacter of material things.--The outcome of all this is that we have to\ncognise Brahman as carrying plurality within itself, and the world, which is\nthe manifestation of his power, as something real.\n\nWhen now the text, in the _s_ loka \'where all difference has vanished\' (Vi.\nPu. VI, 7, 53), declares that the Self, although connected with the different\neffects of Prak _ri_ ti, such as divine, human bodies, and so on, yet is\nessentially free from all such distinctions, and therefore not the object of\nthe words denoting those different classes of beings, but to be defined as\nmere knowledge and Being; to be known by the Self and not to be reached by the\nmind of the practitioner of Yoga (yogayu _g_ ); this must in no way be\nunderstood as denying the reality of the world.--But how is this known?--As\nfollows, we reply. The chapter of the Pura _n_ a in which that _s_ loka occurs\nat first declares concentration (Yoga) to be the remedy of all the afflictions\nof the Sa _m_ sara; thereupon explains the different stages of Yoga up to the\nso-called pratyahara (complete restraining of the senses from receiving\nexternal impressions); then, in order to teach the attainment of the \'perfect\nobject\' ( _s_ ubha _s_ raya) required for dhara _n_ a, declares that the\nhighest Brahman, i. e. Vish _n_ u, possesses two forms, called powers ( _s_\nakti), viz. a denned one (murta) and an undefined one (amurta); and then\nteaches that a portion of the \'defined\' form, viz. the embodied soul (kshetra\n_g \xc3\xb1_a), which is distinguished by its connexion with matter and involved in\nNescience--that is termed \'action,\' and constitutes a third power--is not\nperfect. The chapter further teaches that a portion of the undefined form\nwhich is free from Nescience called action, separated from all matter, and\npossessing the character of pure knowledge, is also not the \'perfect object,\'\nsince it is destitute of essential purity; and, finally, declares that the\n\'perfect object\' is to be found in that defined form which is special to\nBhagavat, and which is the abode of the three powers, viz. that non-defined\nform which is the highest power, that non-defined form which is termed\nembodied soul, and constitutes the secondary (apara) power, and\n\np. 90\n\n[paragraph continues] Nescience in the form of work--which is called the third\npower, and is the cause of the Self, which is of the essence of the highest\npower, passing into the state of embodied soul. This defined form (which is\nthe \'perfect object\') is proved by certain Vedanta-texts, such as \'that great\nperson of sun-like lustre\' ( _S_ vet. Up. III, 8). We hence must take the _s_\nloka, \'in which all differences vanish,\' &c., to mean that the pure Self (the\nSelf in so far as knowledge only) is not capable of constituting the \'perfect\nobject.\' Analogously two other passages declare \'Because this cannot be\nreflected upon by the beginner in Yoga, the second (form) of Vish _n_ u is to\nbe meditated upon by Yogins-the highest abode.\' \'That in which all these\npowers have their abode, that is the other great form of Hari, different from\nthe (material) Vi _s_ va form.\'\n\nIn an analogous manner, Para _s_ ara declares that Brahma, _K_ aturmukha,\nSanaka, and similar mighty beings which dwell within this world, cannot\nconstitute the \'perfect object\' because they are involved in Nescience; after\nthat goes on to say that the beings found in the Sa _m_ sara are in the same\ncondition--for they are essentially devoid of purity since they reach their\ntrue nature, only later on, when through Yoga knowledge has arisen in them--;\nand finally teaches that the essential individual nature of the highest\nBrahman, i.e. Vish _n_ u, constitutes the \'perfect object.\' \'From Brahma down\nto a blade of grass, all living beings that dwell within this world are in the\npower of the Sa _m_ sara due to works, and hence no profit can be derived by\nthe devout from making them objects of their meditation. They are all\nimplicated in Nescience, and stand within the sphere of the Sa _m_ sara;\nknowledge arises in them only later on, and they are thus of no use in\nmeditation. Their knowledge does not belong to them by essential nature, for\nit comes to them through something else. Therefore the stainless Brahman which\npossesses essential knowledge,\' &c. &c.--All this proves that the passage \'in\nwhich all difference vanishes\' does not mean to deny the reality of the world.\n\nNor, again, does the passage \'that which has knowledge\n\np. 91\n\nfor its essential nature\' (Vi. Pu. 1,2,6) imply that the whole complex of\nthings different from knowledge is false; for it declares only that the\nappearance of the Self--the essential nature of which is knowledge--as gods,\nmen, and so on, is erroneous. A declaration that the appearance of mother o\'\npearl as silver is founded on error surely does not imply that all the silver\nin the world is unreal!--But if, on the ground of an insight into the oneness\nof Brahman and the world--as expressed in texts where the two appear in co-\nordination--a text declares that it is an error to view Brahman, whose\nessential nature is knowledge, under the form of material things, this after\nall implies that the whole aggregate of things is false!--By no means, we\nrejoin. As our _s_ astra distinctly teaches that the highest Brahman, i. e.\nVish _n_ u, is free from all imperfections whatsoever, comprises within\nhimself all auspicious qualities, and reveals his power in mighty\nmanifestations, the view of the world\'s reality cannot possibly be erroneous.\nThat information as to the oneness of two things by means of co-ordination\ndoes not allow of sublation (of either of the two), and is non-contradictory,\nwe shall prove further on. Hence also the _s_ loka last referred to does not\nsublate the reality of the world.\n\n\'That from whence these beings are born, by which, when born, they live, into\nwhich they enter when they die, endeavour to know that; that is Brahman\'\n(Taitt. Up. III, 1). From this scriptural text we ascertain that Brahman is\nthe cause of the origination, and so on, of the world. After this we learn\nfrom a Pura _n_ a text (\'He should make the Veda grow by means of Itihasa and\nPura _n_ a; the Veda fears that a man of little reading may do it harm\') that\nthe Veda should be made to grow by Itihasa and Pura _n_ a. By this \'making to\ngrow\' we have to understand the elucidation of the sense of the Vedic texts\nstudied by means of other texts, promulgated by men who had mastered the\nentire Veda and its contents, and by the strength of their devotion had gained\nfull intuition of Vedic truth. Such \'making to grow\' must needs be undertaken,\nsince the purport of the entire Veda with all its _S_ akhas cannot be fathomed\nby one\n\np. 92\n\nwho has studied a small part only, and since without knowing that purport we\ncannot arrive at any certitude.\n\nThe Vish _n_ u Pura _n_ a relates how Maitreya, wishing to have his knowledge\nof Vedic matters strengthened by the holy Parasara, who through the favour of\nPulastya and Vasish _th_ a had obtained an insight into the true nature of the\nhighest divinity, began to question Para _s_ ara, \'I am desirous to hear from\nthee how this world originated, and how it will again originate in future, and\nof what it consists, and whence proceed animate and inanimate things; how and\ninto what it has been resolved, and into what it will in future be resolved?\'\n&c. (Vi. Pu. I, 1). The questions asked refer to the essential nature of\nBrahman, the different modes of the manifestation of its power, and the\ndifferent results of propitiating it. Among the questions belonging to the\nfirst category, the question \'whence proceed animate and inanimate things?\'\nrelates to the efficient and the material cause of the world, and hence the\nclause \'of what the world consists\' is to be taken as implying a question as\nto what constitutes the Self of this world, which is the object of creation,\nsustentation, and dissolution. The reply to this question is given in the\nwords \'and the world is He.\' Now the identity expressed by this clause is\nfounded thereon that he (i.e. Brahman or Vish _n_ u) pervades the world as its\nSelf in the character of its inward Ruler; and is not founded on unity of\nsubstance of the pervading principle and the world pervaded. The phrase\n\'consists of\' (-maya) does not refer to an effect (so that the question asked\nwould be as to the causal substance of which this world is an effect), for a\nseparate question on this point would be needless. Nor does the--maya express,\nas it sometimes does-e.g. in the case of pra _n_ a-maya 1, the own sense of\nthe word to which it is attached; for in that case the form of the reply \'and\nthe world is He\' (which implies a distinction between the world and Vish _n_\nu) would be inappropriate; the reply would in that case rather be \'Vish _n_ u\nonly.\' What \'maya\' actually denotes here is\n\np. 93\n\nabundance, prevailingness, in agreement with Pa _n_ ini, V, 4, 21, and the\nmeaning is that Brahman prevails in the world in so far as the entire world\nconstitutes its body. The co-ordination of the two words \'the world\' and \'He\'\nthus rests on that relation between the two, owing to which the world is the\nbody of Brahman, and Brahman the Self of the world. If, on the other hand, we\nmaintained that the _s_ astra aims only at inculcating the doctrine of one\nsubstance free from all difference, there would be no sense in all those\nquestions and answers, and no sense in an entire _n_ astra devoted to the\nexplanation of that one thing. In that case there would be room for one\nquestion only, viz. \'what is the substrate of the erroneous imagination of a\nworld?\' and for one answer to this question, viz. \'pure consciousness devoid\nof all distinction!\'--And if the co-ordination expressed in the clause \'and\nthe world is he\' was meant to set forth the absolute oneness of the world and\nBrahman, then it could not be held that Brahman possesses all kinds of\nauspicious qualities, and is opposed to all evil; Brahman would rather become\nthe abode of all that is impure. All this confirms the conclusion that the co-\nordination expressed in that clause is to be understood as directly teaching\nthe relation between a Self and its body.--The _s_ loka, \'From Vish _n_ u the\nworld has sprung: in him he exists: he is the cause of the subsistence and\ndissolution of this world: and the world is he\' (Vi. Pu. I, 1, 35), states\nsuccinctly what a subsequent passage--beginning with \'the highest of the high\'\n(Vi. Pu. I, 2, 10)--sets forth in detail. Now there the _s_ loka,\'to the\nunchangeable one\' (I, 2, 1), renders homage to the holy Vish _n_ u, who is the\nhighest Brahman in so far as abiding within his own nature, and then the text\nproceeds to glorify him in his threefold form as Hira _n_ yagarbha, Hari, and\n_S_ ankara, as Pradhana, Time, and as the totality of embodied souls in their\ncombined and distributed form. Here the _s_ loka, \'Him whose essential nature\nis knowledge\' (I, 2, 6), describes the aspect of the highest Self in so far as\nabiding in the state of discrete embodied souls; the passage cannot therefore\nbe understood as referring to a substance free from all difference. If the _s_\nastra aimed\n\np. 94\n\nat teaching that the erroneous conception of a manifold world has for its\nsubstrate a Brahman consisting of non-differenced intelligence, there would be\nroom neither for the objection raised in I, 3, I (\'How can we attribute agency\ncreative and otherwise to Brahman which is without qualities, unlimited, pure,\nstainless?\') nor for the refutation of that objection, \'Because the powers of\nall things are the objects of (true) knowledge excluding all (bad) reasoning,\ntherefore there belong to Brahman also such essential powers as the power of\ncreating, preserving, and so on, the world; just as heat essentially belongs\nto fire 1.\' In that case the objection would rather be made in the following\nform: \'How can Brahman, which is without qualities, be the agent in the\ncreation, preservation, and so on, of the world?\' and the answer would be,\n\'Creation by Brahman is not something real, but something erroneously\nimagined.\'--The purport of the objection as it stands in the text is as\nfollows: \'We observe that action creative and otherwise belongs to beings\nendowed with qualities such as goodness, and so on, not perfect, and subject\nto the influence of karman; how then can agency creative, and so on, be\nattributed to Brahman which is devoid of qualities, perfect, not under the\ninfluence of karman, and incapable of any connexion with action?\' And the\nreply is, \'There is nothing unreasonable in holding that Brahman as being of\nthe nature described above, and different in kind from all things perceived,\nshould possess manifold powers; just as fire, which is different in kind from\nwater and all other material substances, possesses the quality of heat and\nother qualities.\' The _s_ lokas also, which begin with the words \'Thou alone\nart real\' (Vi. Pu. I, 4, 38 ff.), do not assert that the whole world is\nunreal, but only that, as Brahman is the Self of the world, the latter viewed\napart from Brahman is not real. This the text proceeds to confirm,\n\np. 95\n\n[paragraph continues] \'thy greatness it is by which all movable and immovable\nthings are pervaded.\' This means--because all things movable and immovable are\npervaded by thee, therefore all this world has thee for its Self, and hence\n\'there is none other than thee\' and thus thou being the Self of all art alone\nreal. Such being the doctrine intended to be set forth, the text rightly says,\n\'this all-pervasiveness of thine is thy greatness\'; otherwise it would have to\nsay, \'it is thy error.\' Were this latter view intended, words such as \'Lord of\nthe world,\' \'thou,\' &c., could not, moreover, be taken in their direct sense,\nand there would arise a contradiction with the subject-matter of the entire\nchapter, viz. the praise of the Holy one who in the form of a mighty boar had\nuplifted in play the entire earth.--Because this entire world is thy form in\nso far as it is pervaded as its Self by thee whose true nature is knowledge;\ntherefore those who do not possess that devotion which enables men to view\nthee as the Self of all, erroneously view this world as consisting only of\ngods, men, and other beings; this is the purport of the next _s_ loka, \'this\nwhich is seen.\'--And it is an error not only to view the world which has its\nreal Self in thee as consisting of gods, men, and so on, but also to consider\nthe Selfs whose true nature is knowledge as being of the nature of material\nbeings such as gods, men, and the like; this is the meaning of the next _s_\nloka, \'this world whose true nature is knowledge.\'--Those wise men, on the\nother hand, who have an insight into the essentially intelligent Self, and\nwhose minds are cleared by devotion--the means of apprehending the Holy one as\nthe universal Self--, they view this entire world with all its manifold bodies\n--the effects of primeval matter--as thy body--a body the Self of which is\nconstituted by knowledge abiding apart from its world-body; this is the\nmeaning of the following _s_ loka: \'But those who possess knowledge,\' &c.--If\nthe different _s_ lokas were not interpreted in this way, they would be mere\nunmeaning reiterations; their constitutive words could not be taken in their\nprimary sense; and we should come into conflict with the sense of the\npassages, the subject-matter of the chapter, and the\n\np. 96\n\npurport of the entire _s_ astra. The passage, further, \'Of that Self although\nit exists in one\'s own and in other bodies, the knowledge is of one kind\' (Vi.\nPu. II, 14, 31 ff.), refers to that view of duality according to which the\ndifferent Selfs--although equal in so far as they are all of the essence of\nknowledge--are constituted into separate beings, gods, men, &c., by their\nconnexion with different portions of matter all of which are modifications of\nprimary matter, and declares that view to be false. But this does not imply a\ndenial of the duality which holds good between matter on the one hand and Self\non the other: what the passage means is that the Self which dwells in the\ndifferent material bodies of gods, men, and so on, is of one and the same\nkind. So the Holy one himself has said, \'In the dog and the low man eating\ndog\'s flesh the wise see the same\'; \'Brahman, without any imperfection, is the\nsame\' (Bha. Gi. V, 18, 19). And, moreover, the clause \'Of the Self although\nexisting in one\'s own and in other bodies\' directly declares that a thing\ndifferent from the body is distributed among one\'s own and other bodies.\n\nNor does the passage \'If there is some other (para) different(anya)from me,\'\n&c. (Vi. Pu. II, 13, 86) intimate the oneness of the Self; for in that case\nthe two words \'para\' and \'anya\' would express one meaning only (viz. \'other\'\nin the sense of \'distinct from\'). The word \'para\' there denotes a Self\ndistinct from that of one\'s own Self, and the word \'anya\' is introduced to\nnegative a character different from that of pure intelligence: the sense of\nthe passage thus is \'If there is some Self distinct from mine, and of a\ncharacter different from mine which is pure knowledge, then it can be said\nthat I am of such a character and he of a different character\'; but this is\nnot the case, because all Selfs are equal in as far as their nature consists\nof pure knowledge.--Also the _s_ loka beginning \'Owing to the difference of\nthe holes of the flute\' (Vi. Pu. II, 14, 32) only declares that the inequality\nof the different Selfs is owing not to their essential nature, but to their\ndwelling in different material bodies; and does not teach the oneness of all\nSelfs. The different portions of air, again, passing\n\np. 97\n\nthrough the different holes of the flute--to which the many Selfs are compared\n--are not said to be one but only to be equal in character; they are one in\ncharacter in so far as all of them are of the nature of air, while the\ndifferent names of the successive notes of the musical scale are applied to\nthem because they pass out by the different holes of the instrument. For an\nanalogous reason the several Selfs are denominated by different names, viz.\ngods and so on. Those material things also which are parts of the substance\nfire, or water, or earth, are one in so far only as they consist of one kind\nof substance; but are not absolutely one; those different portions of air,\ntherefore, which constitute the notes of the scale are likewise not absolutely\none. Where the Pura _n_ a further says \'He (or "that") I am and thou art He\n(or "that"); all this universe that has Self for its true nature is He (or\n"that"); abandon the error of distinction\' (Vi. Pu. II, 16, 23); the word\n\'that\' refers to the intelligent character mentioned previously which is\ncommon to all Selfs, and the co-ordination stated in the two clauses therefore\nintimates that intelligence is the character of the beings denoted \'I\' and\n\'Thou\'; \'abandon therefore,\' the text goes on to say, \'the illusion that the\ndifference of outward form, divine and so on, causes a corresponding\ndifference in the Selfs.\' If this explanation were not accepted (but absolute\nnon-difference insisted upon) there would be no room for the references to\ndifference which the passages quoted manifestly contain.\n\nAccordingly the text goes on to say that the king acted on the instruction he\nhad received, \'he abandoned the view of difference, having recognised the\nReal.\'--But on what ground do we arrive at this decision (viz. that the\npassage under discussion is not meant to teach absolute non-duality)?--On the\nground, we reply, that the proper topic of the whole section is to teach the\ndistinction of the Self and the body--for this is evident from what is said in\nan early part of the section, \'as the body of man, characterised by hands,\nfeet, and the like,\' &c. (Vi. Pu. II, 13, 85).--For analogous reasons the _s_\nloka \'When that knowledge which gives rise to distinction\' &c. (Vi. Pu. VI, 7,\n94) teaches\n\np. 98\n\nneither the essential unity of all Selfs nor the oneness of the individual\nSelf and the highest Self. And that the embodied soul and the highest Self\nshould be essentially one, is no more possible than that the body and the Self\nshould be one. In agreement herewith Scripture says, \'Two birds, inseparable\nfriends, cling to the same tree. One of them eats the sweet fruit, the other\nlooks on without eating\' (Mu. Up. III, 1, 1). \'There are two drinking their\nreward in the world of their own works, entered into the cave, dwelling on the\nhighest summit. Those who know Brahman call them shade and light,\' &c. (Ka.\nUp. I, 3, 1). And in this _s_ astra also (i.e. the Vish _n_ u Pura _n_ a)\nthere are passages of analogous import; cp. the stanzas quoted above, \'He\ntranscends the causal matter, all effects, all imperfections such as the gu\n_n_ as\' &c.\n\nThe Sutras also maintain the same doctrine, cp. I, 1, 17; I, 2, 21; II, 1, 22;\nand others. They therein follow Scripture, which in several places refers to\nthe highest and the individual soul as standing over against each other, cp.\ne.g. \'He who dwells in the Self and within the Self, whom the Self does not\nknow, whose body the Self is, who rules the Self from within\' (B _ri_. Up.\nIII, 7, 22); \'Embraced by the intelligent Self (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 21);\n\'Mounted by the intelligent Self (IV, 3, 35). Nor can the individual Self\nbecome one with the highest Self by freeing itself from Nescience, with the\nhelp of the means of final Release; for that which admits of being the abode\nof Nescience can never become quite incapable of it. So the Pura _n_ a says,\n\'It is false to maintain that the individual Self and the highest Self enter\ninto real union; for one substance cannot pass over into the nature of another\nsubstance.\' Accordingly the Bhagavad Gita declares that the released soul\nattains only the same attributes as the highest Self. \'Abiding by this\nknowledge, they, attaining to an equality of attributes with me, do neither\ncome forth at the time of creation, nor are troubled at the time of general\ndestruction\' (XIV, 2). Similarly our Pura _n_ a says, \'That Brahman leads him\nwho meditates on it, and who is capable of change, towards its own being\n(atmabhava), in the same\n\np. 99\n\nway as the magnet attracts the iron\' (Vi. Pu. VI, 7, 30). Here the phrase\n\'leads him towards his own being\' means \'imparts to him a nature like his own\'\n(not \'completely identifies him with itself\'); for the attracted body does not\nbecome essentially one with the body attracting.\n\nThe same view will be set forth by the Sutrakara in IV, 4, 17; 2l, and I, 3,\n2. The V _ri_ tti also says (with reference to Su. IV, 4, 17) \'with the\nexception of the business of the world (the individual soul in the state of\nrelease) is equal (to the highest Self) through light\'; and the author of the\nDrami _d_ abhashya says, \'Owing to its equality (sayu _g_ ya) with the\ndivinity the disembodied soul effects all things, like the divinity.\' The\nfollowing scriptural texts establish the same view, \'Those who depart from\nhence, after having known the Self and those true desires, for them there is\nfreedom in all the worlds\' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 1, 6); \'He who knows Brahman\nreaches the Highest\' (Taitt. Up. II, 1); \'He obtains all desires together with\nthe intelligent Brahman\' (Taitt. Up. II, 1, 1); \'Having reached the Self which\nconsists of bliss, he wanders about in these worlds having as much food and\nassuming as many forms as he likes\' (Taitt. Up. III, 10, 5); \'There he moves\nabout\' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 12, 3); \'For he is flavour; for only after having\nperceived a flavour can any one perceive pleasure\' (Taitt. Up. II, 7); \'As the\nflowing rivers go to their setting in the sea, losing name and form; thus he\nwho knows, freed from name and form, goes to the divine Person who is higher\nthan the high\' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 8); \'He who knows, shaking off good and evil,\nreaches the highest oneness, free from stain\' (Mu. Up. III, 1, 3).\n\nThe objects of meditation in all the vidyas which refer to the highest\nBrahman, are Brahman viewed as having qualities, and the fruit of all those\nmeditations. For this reason the author of the Sutras declares that there is\noption among the different vidyas--cp. Ve. Su. III, 3, II; III., 3, 59. In the\nsame way the Vakyakara teaches that the qualified Brahman only is the object\nof meditation, and that there is option of vidyas; where he says \'(Brahman)\nconnected (with qualities), since the meditation refers to its\n\np. 100\n\nqualities.\' The same view is expressed by the Bhashyakara in the passage\nbeginning \'Although he who bases himself on the knowledge of Being.\'--Texts\nsuch as \'He knows Brahman, he becomes Brahman\' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 9) have the\nsame purport, for they must be taken in connexion with the other texts\n(referring to the fate of him who knows) such as \'Freed from name and form he\ngoes to the divine Person who is higher than the high\'; \'Free from stain he\nreaches the highest oneness\' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 8; III, 1,3); \'Having approached\nthe highest light he manifests himself in his own shape\' (Kh. Up. VIII, 3, 4).\nOf him who has freed himself from his ordinary name and form, and all the\ndistinctions founded thereon, and has assumed the uniform character of\nintelligence, it may be said that he is of the character of Brahman.--Our Pura\n_n_ a also propounds the same view. The _s_ loka (VI, 7, 91), \'Knowledge is\nthe means to obtain what is to be obtained, viz. the highest Brahman: the Self\nis to be obtained, freed from all kinds of imagination,\' states that that Self\nwhich through meditation on Brahman, is freed from all imagination so as to be\nlike Brahman, is the object to be attained. (The three forms of imagination to\nbe got rid of are so-called karma-bhavana, brahma-bhavana and a combination of\nthe two. See Vi. Pu. VI, 7.) The text then goes on, \'The embodied Self is the\nuser of the instrument, knowledge is its instrument; having accomplished\nRelease--whereby his object is attained--he may leave off.\' This means that\nthe Devotee is to practise meditation on the highest Brahman until it has\naccomplished its end, viz. the attainment of the Self free from all\nimagination.--The text continues, \'Having attained the being of its being,\nthen he is non-different from the highest Self; his difference is founded on\nNescience only.\' This _s_ loka describes the state of the released soul. \'Its\nbeing\' is the being, viz. the character or nature, of Brahman; but this does\nnot mean absolute oneness of nature; because in this latter case the second\n\'being\' would be out of place and the _s_ loka would contradict what had been\nsaid before. The meaning is: when the soul has attained the nature of\n\np. 101\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahman, i.e. when it has freed itself from all false\nimagination, then it is non-different from the highest Self. This non-\ndifference is due to the soul, as well as the highest Self, having the\nessential nature of uniform intelligence. The difference of the soul--\npresenting itself as the soul of a god, a man, &c.--from the highest Self is\nnot due to its essential nature, but rests on the basis of Nescience in the\nform of work: when through meditation on Brahman this basis is destroyed, the\ndifference due to it comes to an end, and the soul no longer differs from the\nhighest Self. So another text says, \'The difference of things of one nature is\ndue to the investing agency of outward works; when the difference of gods,\nmen, &c., is destroyed, it has no longer any investing power\' (Vi. Pu. II, 14,\n33).--The text then adds a further explanation, \'when the knowledge which\ngives rise to manifold difference is completely destroyed, who then will\nproduce difference that has no real existence?\' The manifold difference is the\ndistinction of gods, men, animals, and inanimate things: compare the saying of\n_S_ aunaka:\'this fourfold distinction is founded on false knowledge.\' The Self\nhas knowledge for its essential nature; when Nescience called work--which is\nthe cause of the manifold distinctions of gods, men, &c.--has been completely\ndestroyed through meditation on the highest Brahman, who then will bring about\nthe distinction of gods, &c., from the highest Self--a distinction which in\nthe absence of a cause cannot truly exist.--That Nescience is called\nkarman(work)is stated in the same chapter of the Pura _n_ a (st. 61--avidya\nkarmasa _mg \xc3\xb1_a).\n\nThe passage in the Bhagavad Gita, \'Know me to be the kshetra _g \xc3\xb1_a\' (XIII,\n2), teaches the oneness of all in so far as the highest Self is the inward\nruler of all; taken in any other sense it would be in conflict with other\ntexts, such as \'All creatures are the Perishable, the unchanging soul is the\nImperishable; but another is the highest Person\' (Bha. Gi. XV, 16). In other\nplaces the Divine one declares that as inward Ruler he is the Self of all:\n\'The Lord dwells in the heart of all creatures\' (XVIII, 61), and \'I dwell\nwithin the heart of all\' (XV, 15). and \'I am the\n\np. 102\n\nSelf which has its abode within all creatures\' (X, 20). The term \'creature\' in\nthese passages denotes the entire aggregate of body, &c., up to the Self.--\nBecause he is the Self of all, the text expressly denies that among all the\nthings constituting his body there is any one separate from him,\'There is not\nanything which is without me\' (X, 39). The place where this text occurs is the\nwinding up of a glorification of the Divine one, and the text has to be\nunderstood accordingly. The passage immediately following is \'Whatever being\nthere is, powerful, beautiful, or glorious, even that know thou to have sprung\nfrom a portion of my glory; pervading this entire Universe by a portion of\nmine I do abide\' (X, 41; 42).\n\nAll this clearly proves that the authoritative books do _not_ teach the\ndoctrine of one non-differenced substance; that they do _not_ teach that the\nuniverse of things is false; and that they do _not_ deny the essential\ndistinction of intelligent beings, non-intelligent things, and the Lord.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[92:1](sbe48027.htm#fr_15) \'Pra _n_ amaya\' is explained as meaning \'pra _n_ a\'\nonly.\n\n[94:1](sbe48027.htm#fr_16) The sense in which this sloka has to be taken is\n\'As in ordinary life we ascribe to certain things (e.g. gems, mantras) certain\nspecial powers because otherwise the effects they produce could not be\naccounted for; so to Brahman also,\' &c.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The theory of Nescience cannot be proved](sbe48028.htm)\n\n'
