 \nCan he, whose slaves and menials eat  \nThe finest cakes of sifted wheat--  \nCan Rama in the forest live  \nOn roots and fruit which woodlands give  \nWho will believe, who will not fear  \nWhen the sad story smites his ear,  \nThat one so dear, so noble held,  \nIs by the king his sire expelled?  \nNow surely none may Fate resist,  \nWhich orders all as it may list,  \nIf, Rama, in thy strength and grace,  \nThe woods become thy dwelling-place.  \nA childless mother long I grieved,  \nAnd many a sigh for offspring heaved,  \nWith wistful longing weak and worn  \nTill thou at last, my son, wast born.  \nFanned by the storm of that desire  \nDeep in my soul I felt the fire,  \nWhose offerings flowed from weeping eyes,  \nWith fuel fed of groans and sighs,  \n\np. 123  \n\nWhile round the flame the smoke grew hot  \nOf tears because thou earnest not.  \nNow reft of thee, too fiery fierce  \nThe flame of woe my heart will pierce,  \nAs, when the days of spring return,  \nThe sun's hot beams the forest burn.  \nThe mother cow still follows near  \nThe wanderings of her youngling dear.  \nSo close to thine my feet shall be,  \nWhere'er thou goest following thee.'  \n\nRama, the noblest lord of men,  \nHeard his fond mother's speech, and then  \nIn soothing words like these replied  \nTo the sad queen who wept and sighed:  \n'Nay, by Kaikeyi's art beguiled,  \nWhen I am banished to the wild,  \nIf thou, my mother, also fly,  \nThe aged king will surely die.  \nWhen wedded dames their lords forsake,  \nLong for the crime their souls shall ache.  \nThou must not e'en in thought within  \nThy bosom frame so dire a sin.  \nLong as Kakutstha's son, who reigns  \nLord of the earth, in life remains,  \nThou must with love his will obey:  \nThis duty claims, supreme for aye.  \nYes, mother, thou and I must be  \nSubmissive to my sire's decree,  \nKing, husband, sire is he confessed,  \nThe lord of all, the worthiest.  \nI in the wilds my days will spend  \nTill twice seven years have reached an end,  \nThen with great joy will come again,  \nAnd faithful to thy hests remain.'  \n\nKaus'alya by her son addressed,  \nWith love and passion sore distressed,  \nAfflicted, with her eyes bedewed,  \nTo Rama thus her speech renewed:  \n\n'Nay, Rama, but my heart will break  \nIf with these queens my home I make.  \nLead me too with thee; let me go  \nAnd wander like a woodland roe.'  \n\nThen, while no tear the hero shed.  \nThus to the weeping queen he said:  \n'Mother, while lives the husband, he  \nIs woman's lord and deity.  \nO dearest lady, thou and I  \nOur lord and king must ne'er deny;  \nThe lord of earth himself have we  \nOur guardian wise and friend to be.  \nAnd Bharat, true to duty's call,  \nWhose sweet words take the hearts of all,  \nWill serve thee well, and ne'er forget  \nThe virtuous path before him set.  \nBe this, I pray, thine earnest care,  \nThat the old king my father ne'er,  \nWhen I have parted hence, may know,  \nGrieved for his son, a pang of woe.  \nLet not this grief his soul distress,  \nTo kill him with the bitterness.  \nWith duteous care, in every thing,  \nLove, comfort, cheer the aged king.  \nThough, best of womankind, a spouse  \nKeeps firmly all her fasts and vows,  \nNor yet her husband's will obeys, '  \nShe treads in sin's forbidden ways.  \nShe to her husband's will who bends,  \nGoes to high bliss that never ends,  \nYea, though the Gods have found in her  \nNo reverential worshipper.  \nBent on his weal, a woman still  \nMust seek to do her husband's will:  \nFor Scripture, custom, law uphold  \nThis duty Heaven revealed of old.  \nHonour true Brahmans for my sake,  \nAnd constant offerings duly make,  \nWith fire-oblations and with flowers,  \nTo all the host of heavenly powers.  \nLook to the coming time, and yearn  \nFor the glad hour of my return.  \nAnd still thy duteous course pursue,  \nAbstemious, humble, kind, and true.  \nThe highest bliss shall thou obtain  \nWhen I from exile come again,  \nIf, best of those who keep the right,  \nThe king my sire still see the light.'  \n\nThe queen, by Rama thus addressed,  \nStill with a mother's grief oppressed,  \nWhile her long eyes with tears were dim,  \nBegan once more and answered him:  \n'Not by my pleading maybe stayed  \nThe firm resolve thy soul has made.  \nMy hero, thou wilt go; and none  \nThe stern commands of Fate may shun.  \nGo forth, dear child whom naught can bend  \nAnd may all bliss thy steps attend.  \nThou wilt return, and that dear day  \nWill chase mine every grief away.  \nThou wilt return, thy duty done,  \nThy vows discharged, high glory won;  \nFrom filial debt wilt thou be free,  \nAnd sweetest joy will come on me.  \nMy son, the will of mighty Fate  \nAt every time must dominate,  \nIf now it drives thee hence to stray  \nHeedless of me who bid thee stay.  \nGo, strong of arm, go forth, my boy,  \nGo forth, again to come with joy,  \nAnd thine expectant mother cheer  \nWith those sweet tones she loves to hear.  \nO that the blessed hour were nigh  \nWhen thou shalt glad this anxious eye,  \nWith matted hair and hermit dress  \nreturning from the wilderness.'  \n   Kaus'alya's conscious soul approved,  \n     As her proud glance she bent  \n   On Rama constant and unmoved,  \n     Resolved on banishment.  \n   Such words, with happy omens fraught  \n     To her dear son she said,  \n   Invoking with each eager thought  \n     A blessing on his head.  \n\np. 124  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXV.: Kaus'alya's Blessing.](ry103.htm)\n\n"
