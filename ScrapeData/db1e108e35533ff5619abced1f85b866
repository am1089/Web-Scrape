Janamejaya said :-- O best of Ri _s_ is! I have now seen the wonderful\nexcellent deeds of the Devi for the enhancement of peace in this world. Though\nI have heard from thy lotus face these nectar-like words, still I am not\nsatisfied. O best of Munis! What did the chief Devas do when the Goddess\ndisappeared, kindly say to me. O Bhagavan! I think those Jivas cannot fully\ncomprehend these excellent sacred deeds of the Devi, that are less fortunate\nand have done not many meritorious deeds in this world. O Muni! What to speak\nof the less fortunate souls, even the Mahatmas who are well versed in hearing\nsuch things, can hardly be satiated on hearing the Devi\xc2\x92s deeds. O! Fie to\nthose, that do not hear of these things, the essence of essences, on hearing\nwhich men become Immortals. The Mother\xc2\x92s Lila is to preserve the Devas as well\nas the great Munis and to serve as a boat for the human beings to cross this\nocean of world. How can, then, the grateful souls forsake Her? The Pundits\nversed in the Vedas declare, that the Devi\xc2\x92s life is able to fulfil all the\ndesires. Therefore the liberated souls that want liberation, the worldly\nsouls, the diseased all ought to drink incessantly the nectar-like nectar of\nDevi\xc2\x92s doings. Especially the kings that are engaged in Dharma, in earning\nwealth and in enjoyments, ought to hear Her life. O Muni! When the liberated\nsouls drink the nectar-like doings of the Devi, what doubt can there be with\nthe ordinary human beings, to listen with rapt devotion those wondrous things!\nO Best of Munis! It is those that worshipped the Goddess Bhavani in their\nprevious births with\n\n\n\np. 423\n\n\n\nbeautiful Ku _nd_ a flowers, Champaka flowers and Bel leaves, they have, it is\ninferred, in their present births become possessed of rich enjoyments. And\nthose devoid of any devotion, that obtained this human body in the land of\nBharata and did not worship the Mother Goddess, they are, in the present\nbirths, without grains and riches, diseased, and void of any issues. Wander\nthey always as servants, carrying out orders, and bearing on the burden loads;\nday and night, they seek for their own selfish ends, yet they cannot get their\nbelly full meals. The blind, deaf and dumb; lame and lepers suffer pain and\nmisery in this earth; seeing them, it should be inferred that they never\nworshipped the Goddess Bhavani. And those that are wealthy, prosperous,\nattended by numerous attendants and are always enjoying, like kings, it is to\nbe inferred that they certainly worshipped the lotus feet of the Mother\nGoddess in their past lives.\n\n\n\n12-15. Therefore O Son of Satyavati! As you are kind-hearted, kindly narrate\nbefore me the excellent deeds of the Devi. O best of Munis! Where did the\nGoddess, Maha Lak _s_ mi, created out of the energies of all the gods, depart\nafter She had slain the Mahi _s_ asura and had been worshipped and praised by\nthe Devas? O highly Fortunate one! You told me that She vanished from the\nsight of the Devas; now I like to know where is She staying now, whether in\nthe Heavens or in the Land of Mortals? Did She melt away then and there or did\nShe descend to Vaiku _nt_ ha or did She go to the mountain Sumeru? O Muni!\nNarrate all these duly before me.\n\n\n\n16-50. Vyasa said :-- O King! I told you before about the beautiful Ma _n_ i\nDvipa; that island is the place of sport to the Devi and very dear to Her. In\nthat place Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, Mahadeva were transformed into females; they\nafterwards became males and were engaged in their respective duties. That\nplace is grand and splendid and is in the centre of the ocean of Nectar; the\nDevi Ambika assumes various forms there as She likes; and She sports there. To\nthat Ma _n_ i Dvipa the auspicious Devi departed after She had been praised by\nthe Gods, to that place where sports always the eternal Bhagavati\nBhuvanes\xc2\x92vari, the incarnate of Para Brahma. When the Highest Goddess\nvanished, the Devas installed, on the throne of Mahi _s_ asura, the powerful\nKing S\xc2\x92atrughna, endowed with all auspicious qualities, the Lord of Ajodhya\nand descended from the Solar line. After making him thus the King, Indra and\nthe other Devas went to their respective abodes on their own conveyances. O\nKing! The Devas having gone to their places, the subjects were governed on\nthis earth according to Dharma; and they passed their times in ease and\ncomfort. It used to rain, then, timely and the earth was covered with plenty\nof grains and wealth; the\n\n\n\np. 424\n\n\n\ntrees were all filled with fruits and leaves and gave enjoyment to people. The\ncows with their udders full like earthen pots gave such a profuse quantity of\nmilk that men began to milk them whenever they liked. The rivers\xc2\x92 waters were\nall clear and cooling; and they flowed full in regular channels; the birds\ngrouped round them. The Brahma _n_ as, versed in the Vedas, were engaged in\nperforming sacrifices; the K _s_ attriyas observed their virtues and were\nengaged in doing charities and in their education; the kings held their rods\nof justice and were engaged in governing their subjects; though the several\nkings were busy with various arms and weapons, they all became fond of peace.\nThus no wars nor quarrels were seen amongst the subjects; and the mines\nyielded plenty of wealth to the people. O best of Kings! There were the Brahma\n_n_ s, K _s_ attriyas, Vais\xc2\x92yas and S\xc2\x92udras who became the devotees of the\nGoddess. The Brahma _n_ as and K _s_ attriyas used, then, to perform so many\nsacrifices that, at every nook and corner in this globe, the sacrificial\naltars and the sacrificial posts became visible. The female sex became gentle\nand of good behaviour, truthful and chaste towards their husbands\nrespectively. Atheism and unrighteous acts vanished entirely from the face of\nthe earth; the people left all dry discussions; they argued only about the\nS\xc2\x92astras that did not go in contra-distinction to the Vedas. Nobody liked to\nquarrel with each other; poverty, and evil inclinations were checked; the\npeople everywhere lived in happiness. Untimely death was not there; so the\npeople had no bereavements with their friends; no distress was seen. Famine,\nwant of rains, and deadly plagues were out of sight. The people had no illness\neven; and jealousies and quarrels vanished. O King! all men and women began to\nsport merrily everywhere like the Gods in Heaven. Theft, atheism, deceit,\nvanity, hypocrisy, lustfulness, stupidity, and the anti-Vedic feelings were\nnot to be seen. O Lord of the Earth! All the men were then extremely devoted\nto their Dharma and engaged in serving the Brahma _n_ as. The Brahmi _n_ s\nwere also, according to the three-fold plan of the creation, Sattvik, Rajasik\nand Tamasik. The Sattvik Brahmi _n_ s were all versed in the Vedas, clever and\ntruthful; they were kind, they controlled their passions and they did not\naccept any presents from others. Filled with their ideas of Dharma, they used\nto perform their Puro _d_ a _s_ a and other such sacrifices with Sattvik rice,\netc., but never, never did they immolate any animals.* O King! The Sattvik\nBrahma _n_ as gave charities, studied the Vedas and offered sacrifices for\nthemselves. These were their three ordained actions. They were busy in these.\nO King! The Rajasik Brahma _n_ as were versed in the Vedas and acted as\npriests to the K _s_ attriyas\n\n\n\n*N.B. - Where the victim is fastened during the time of immolation.\n\n\n\np. 425\n\n\n\nand ate flesh as sanctioned by recognised rules. They were busy with their six\nduties. They offered sacrifices on their own behalf, assisted others in\nsacrifices, took gifts, made charities, studied and taught others the Vedas.\nThe Tamasik Brahma _n_ as were angry, attached to worldly objects, and\njealous. They studied very little of the Vedas and spent most of their time in\nserving the kings. O King! Mahi _s_ asura was killed, all the Brahma _n_ as\nwere glad and began to practise Dharma according to the Vedas, observed vows\nand made charities. The K _s_ attriyas began to govern the subjects, the\nVaisya carried on their trading business and the other tribes went on with\ntheir agriculture, preservation of the cows, and lending money on interest.\nThus all men became vary glad on the death of Mahi _s_ a. Devoid of cares and\nanxieties, the subjects got much wealth! The cows were endowed with suspicious\nsigns and gave plenty of milk and the rivers flowed full of waters. The trees\nlooked splendid with abundance of fruits; men were without diseases: in short,\npeople had no mental agony and too much or too little of rains were not there;\nS\xc2\x92alavas, mice, birds, and seditions we not extant. O King! The beings died\nnot prematurely; rather enjoyed incessantly, their full health and possessed\nlots of riches; especially beings, engaged in the Vedic Dharma, served the\nlotus feet of Chandika and thus spent their lives.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twentieth Chapter of the Fifth Book on the peace of the world in\nthe Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i\nVeda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 21](bk05ch21.htm)\n\n'
