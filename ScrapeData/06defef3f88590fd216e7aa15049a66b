Payment of a Debt.\n\n* 1. 1 Which debts must be paid, which other debts must not be paid; by whom, and in what form (they must be paid); and the rules of gift and receipt, (all that) is comprised under the title of 'Recovery of a Debt.'\n\n* 2. The father being dead, it is incumbent on the sons to pay his debt, each according to his share (of the inheritance), in case they are divided in interests. Or, if they are not divided in interests, the debt must\n\np. 42\n\nbe discharged by that son who becomes manager of the family estate.\n\n* 3. 3 That debt which has been contracted by an undivided paternal uncle, brother, or mother, for the benefit of the household, must be discharged wholly by the heirs.\n\n* 4. 4 If a debt has been legitimately inherited by the sons, and left unpaid by them, such debt of the grandfather must be discharged by his grandsons. The liability for it does not include the fourth in descent.\n\n5. 5 Fathers wish to have sons on their own account, thinking in their minds, 'He will release me from all obligations towards superior and inferior beings.'\n\np. 43\n\n6. 6 Three deceased (ancestors) must be worshipped, three must be reverenced before the rest. These\n\np. 44\n\nthree ancestors of a man may claim the discharge of their twofold debt from\nthe fourth in descent.\n\n* 7. 7 If a man fails to pay on demand what had been borrowed or promised by him, that sum (together with the interest) goes on growing till it amounts to a hundred krores (= one milliard).\n\n* 8. A hundred krores having been completed, he is born again, in every successive existence, in his (creditor's) house as his slave, in order to repay the debt (by his labour).\n\n* 9. 9 If an ascetic or an Agnihotri dies without\n\np. 45\n\nhaving discharged his debt, the whole merit collected by his austerities and\nby his Agnihotra belongs to his creditors.\n\n* 10. 10 A father must not pay the debt of his son, but a son must pay a debt contracted by his father, excepting those debts which have been contracted from love, anger, for spirituous liquor, games, or bailments.\n\n* 11. Such debts of a son as have been contracted by him by his father's order, or for the maintenance of the family, or in a precarious situation, must be paid by the father.\n\n* 12. 12 What has been spent for the household by a pupil, apprentice, slave, woman, menial, or agent, must be paid by the head of the household.\n\n13. 13 When the debtor is dead, and the expense has been incurred for the benefit of the family, the debt must be repaid by his relations, even though they be separated from him in interests.\n\np. 46\n\n* 14. 14 The father, uncle, or eldest brother having gone abroad, the son, (or nephew, or younger brother) is not bound to pay his debt before the lapse of twenty years.\n\n* 15. 15 Every single coparcener is liable for debts contracted by another coparcener, if they were contracted while the coparceners were alive and unseparated. But after their death the son of one is not bound to pay the debt of another.\n\n* 16. 16 The wife must not pay a debt contracted by her husband, nor one contracted by her son, except if it had been promised by her, or contracted in common with her husband.\n\n* 17. 17 A sonless widow, and one who has been enjoined by her dying husband (to pay his debt), must pay it. Or (it must be paid) by him who inherits the\n\np. 47\n\nestate. (For) the liability for the debts goes together with the right of\nsuccession.\n\n* 18. 18 A debt contracted by the wife shall never bind the husband, unless it had been contracted at a time when the husband was in distress. Household expenses are indispensably necessary.\n\n* 19. 19 The wives of washermen, huntsmen, cowherds, and distillers of spirituous liquor are exempt from this rule. The income of these men depends on their wives, and the household expenses have also to be defrayed by the wives.\n\n* 20. 20 If a woman who has a son forsakes her son and goes to. live with another man, that man shall take her (separate) property. If she has no property of her own, her son (shall take the property of her husband).\n\n* 21. 21 If, however, a woman repairs to another\n\np. 48\n\nman, carrying her riches and offspring with her, that man must pay the debt\ncontracted by her husband, or he must abandon her.\n\n* 22. He who has intercourse with the wife of a dead man who has neither wealth nor a son, shall have to pay the debt of her husband, because she is considered as his property.\n\n* 23. 23 Among these three, the heir of the wealth, the protector of the widow, and the son, he is liable for the debts who takes the wealth. The son is liable, on failure of a (protector of the) widow and of an heir; the protector of the widow, on failure of an heir and of a son.\n\n* 24. 24 Debts contracted by the husbands of the last\n\np. 49\n\n[paragraph continues] Svairi _n_ i and of the first Punarbhu, must be paid by\nhim who lives with them.\n\n25. 25 A wife, a daughter-in-law, a woman entitled to maintenance, and the attendants of the wife: by these have debts to be paid, as also by one who lives on the produce of land (inherited from the debtor).\n\n[If among such brothers as have come to a division and are separate in wives,\naffairs, and wealth, one should die without leaving issue, his wife inherits\nhis wealth.]\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[41:1](sbe3308.htm#fr_123) The twenty-five sections into which the law of debt\nhas been divided in this translation correspond in the main, though not\nthroughout, to the headings proposed by Asahaya in different portions of his\nwork. Asahaya, as pointed out before, is not consistent with himself in this\nrespect. It is curious to note that the whole law of evidence, excepting the\ngeneral rules laid down in the preceding chapters, has been inserted by Narada\nbetween the divers rules of the law of debt. He seems to have followed in this\nrespect, as in other particulars, the example set to him by the earlier\nlegislators, such as Manu and Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya.\n\nI, 1, 2. If a debt contracted by the father has not been repaid during his\nlifetime, by himself, it must be restored, after his death, by his sons.\nShould they separate, they shall repay it according to their respective\nshares. If they remain united, they shall pay it in common, or the manager\nshall pay it for the rest, no matter whether he may be the senior of the\nfamily or a younger member, who, during the absence of the oldest, or on\naccount of his incapacity, has undertaken the management of the family estate.\nA.\n\n[42:3](sbe3308.htm#fr_124) A debt contracted for the household, by an\nunseparated paternal uncle or brother, or by the mother, must be paid by all\nthe heirs. If they are separate in affairs they must pay for it according to\ntheir shares. If they live in union of interests, they must repay it in\ncommon. A.\n\n2, 3. Manu VIII, 166; Vish _n_ u VI, 27, 35, 36; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 45,\n50.\n\n[42:4](sbe3308.htm#fr_125) A. proposes an explanation of this paragraph which\nis not in accordance with its literal meaning, and decidedly opposed to the\nprinciples of a sound method of interpretation. He says that the term\n'grandsons' must be taken to relate to the grandsons of the debtor's sons,\ni.e. to the great-grandsons of the debtor, and that the term 'the fourth\ndescendant' signifies the fourth in descent from the debtor's sons, i.e. the\nfifth in descent from the debtor himself. This assumption, he says, is\nnecessary in order to reconcile the present rule with the statements of all\nother legislators, and with Narada's own rule (par. 6). Vish _n_ u VI, 27, 28;\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 50.\n\n[42:5](sbe3308.htm#fr_126) A. uses this paragraph in support of his theory\nthat the obligation to pay the debts of an ancestor extends to the fourth in\ndescent. As the great-grandson has to discharge 'the debt to superior beings,'\ni.e. as he has to offer the customary _S_ raddhas to his great-grandfather, so\nhe is liable for debts contracted by him, which have not been repaid.\n\n[43:6](sbe3308.htm#fr_127) Three deceased ancestors, i.e. the father,\ngrandfather, and great-grandfather, may claim the discharge of their\nterrestrial and celestial liabilities from the fourth in descent. This rule is\nillustrated by the history of an action which was brought before a court in\nPatna. A merchant of the Brahman caste, by the name of _S_ ridhara, had lent\nthe whole of his wealth, consisting of 10,000 drammas (drachmas), which he had\ngained through great labour, to a trader, by the name of Devadhara, on\ncondition that interest amounting to two per cent. per mensem of the principal\nstock should be paid to him. The interest was duly paid to _S_ ridhara at the\nend of the first month. In the second month, however, Devadhara met his death\nthrough an accident. His son died of an attack of cholera. Devadhara's great-\ngrandson alone was left. His name was Mahidhara. As he was addicted to\nlicentious courses, the management of the estate was undertaken by his sons\nand maternal uncles. They got into the hands of a cunning Brahman called\nSmartadurdhara, who advised them not to pay a single rupee to _S_ ridhara, as\nhe was able to prove from the law-books that he had no claim to the money. The\nuncles of Mahidhara, much pleased with this piece of advice, promised to give\n1,000 drammas to the Brahman if they need not pay the money to _S_ ridhara.\nThus, when at the close of the second month, the uncles and guardians of\nDevadhara's great-grandson, Mahidhara, were asked by _S_ ridhara to pay 200\ndrammas, being the amount of interest due on the sum lent to Devadhara, they\nrefused payment. They said: 'We do not owe you the principal, much less any\namount of interest. The Brahman Smartadurdhara has pointed out to us that the\nobligation to pay stops with the fourth in descent.' _S_ ridhara was struck\ndumb with grief and terror on hearing this announcement made to him. When he\nhad regained his senses, he repaired to the court of justice, attended by his\nfamily, friends, and servants, and impeached Mahidhara, together with his\nuncles, for their dishonesty. Both parties took sureties. The uncles of\nMahidhara engaged Smartadurdhara to plead for them. After pretending his\nclients to be connected with his family by a friendship of long standing, he\nwent on to refer to a text of Narada (above, par. 4), as proving that the\nobligation to pay the debts of ancestors stops with the fourth in descent. All\nhis arguments, however, were refuted, and held out to derision by a learned p.\n44 Brahman, by the name of Smarta _s_ ekhara, who, at the end of his address,\ncharged him openly with having taken a bribe from his clients. The consequence\nwas that Mahidhara and his uncles lost their cause. A. I have quoted this\nstory in full, because it presents a vivid picture of the way in which\njudicial proceedings used to be transacted in ancient India. The doctrine\nwhich the story is intended to illustrate, viz. that the liability to pay\ndebts contracted by an ancestor extends to the great-grandson, is opposed to\nthe teaching of such an eminent authority as Vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ane _s_ vara, who\nmaintains in the Mitakshara that the great-grandson is not liable for debts\ncontracted by his great-grandfather, and, conversely, that he does not inherit\nhis property. See the author's Tagore Law Lectures (Calcutta, 1885). The same\nopinion was apparently held by the author of the Narada-sm _ri_ ti, as may be\ngathered from par. 4, and by other Sm _ri_ ti writers. It appears quite\nprobable that the present paragraph, which is not quoted in any of the\nstandard compilations on civil law, may have been inserted by the author of\nthe commentary, who wanted to make the contents of the Narada-sm _ri_ ti agree\nwith his personal views. The shorter recension and the quotations, instead of\nthe present paragraph, exhibit another paragraph, in which the obligation of\nthe son only to release his father from debt is inculcated.\n\n[44:7](sbe3308.htm#fr_128) This paragraph has been translated according to the\nexplanation given in Viramitrodaya, p. 358.\n\n[44:9](sbe3308.htm#fr_129) The ample heavenly reward due to an Agnihotri, i.e.\none who has kept the three sacred fires from the date of his birth, or who has\npractised austerities without interruption, shall belong to the creditor, and\nnot to the debtor. A.\n\n[45:10](sbe3308.htm#fr_130) 10, 11. A debt contracted by one blinded by love,\nor incensed by wrath against his own son, or in an outrageous state of\nintoxication, or mad with gambling, or who has become surety for another, must\nnot be paid by the son. If, however, a debt has been contracted, even by the\nson, for the benefit of the household, or in a dangerous situation, it is\nbinding on the father. A. According to Katyayana, a debt contracted from love\nis a promise made to a dissolute woman, and a debt contracted from anger is a\nreward promised by an angry man to a ruffian for injuring the person or estate\nof his enemy. 'A debt contracted in a precarious situation,' i.e. a debt\ncontracted in danger of life. A. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 45, 46, 47; Vish _n_ u\nVI, 33, 39.\n\n[45:12](sbe3308.htm#fr_131) 'A pupil,' one engaged in studying science. 'An\napprentice,' a pupil who resides with his preceptor for a certain fixed\nperiod. 'A slave,' whether born in the house or purchased. A. Vish _n_ u VI,\n39.\n\n[45:13](sbe3308.htm#fr_132) Where the debtor has gone abroad and met his death\nthrough illness, or accident, the debtor may claim his due from his relatives,\nshould they even be separated in interests. A.\n\n[46:14](sbe3308.htm#fr_133) Necessary debts, such as those enumerated in\nparagraph 11, must be paid at once by the other family members. Where,\nhowever, the father, uncle, or eldest brother resides abroad, and is known to\nbe alive, the son, &c. need not pay his debt till after the lapse of twenty\nyears. A. Vish _n_ u VI, 27; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 50.\n\n[46:15](sbe3308.htm#fr_134) After the death of those who have contracted the\ndebt jointly, the son of one is not bound to pay the debt of another than his\nfather. His liability does not extend beyond his father's share of the debt.\nA. Vish _n_ u VI, 34; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 45.\n\n[46:16](sbe3308.htm#fr_135) A woman need not pay a debt contracted by her son,\nunless she has promised herself to repay it. Similarly, she is not bound to\npay a debt contracted by her husband, unless she should have contracted it\njointly with him, or if he should have enjoined her on his deathbed to pay his\ndebts, or if she has inherited his property. A. Vish _n_ u VI, 31, 38; Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 46, 49.\n\n[46:17](sbe3308.htm#fr_136) A widowed woman who has no son is bound to pay the\ndebt of her husband, if he has commissioned her to do so on his deathbed, or\nif his property has escheated to her. If she is unfit to take the estate, her\nhusband's debt must be repaid by those who have inherited the estate. The\nproperty and the liabilities go together. A. Vish _n_ u VI, 29; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya II, 51, &c.\n\n[47:18](sbe3308.htm#fr_137) A debt contracted by the wife, for the purpose of\nsaving from distress her husband, son, daughter, or other family members, must\nbe discharged by the family head. A. Vish _n_ u VI, 32, &c.\n\n[47:19](sbe3308.htm#fr_138) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 48; Vish _n_ u VI, 37.\n\n[47:20](sbe3308.htm#fr_139) If a widow who has a son, blinded by love forsakes\nher son and betakes herself to another husband, taking her Stridhana (separate\nproperty) with her, the Stridhana shall belong to her second husband, and not\nto her sons. If, however, a woman who has no separate property goes to live\nwith another man and takes her first husband's property with her, it shall not\nbelong to the second husband. It shall escheat to her son by the first\nhusband. A. This interpretation has been followed in the text. It is hardly\nreasonable, however, to explain the term dravya, in the first instance, as\ndenoting Stridhana, and then again, as denoting property inherited from the\nhusband. It would seem that the reading adopted by Asahaya is erroneous. The\nViramitrodaya and other compilations read _ri_ na _m_ for dravya _m_ , '(the\nson) must pay the whole debt, if she has no property of her own.' Vish _n_ u\nVI, 30; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 51.\n\n[47:21](sbe3308.htm#fr_140) If a widow who has a young son takes her deceased\nhusband's p. 48 property and goes to live with another man, the latter is\nbound to pay the debts contracted by her first husband. His conduct is\nunimpeachable, likewise, if he lets her go, she taking the whole of her\nproperty with her. A.\n\n[48:23](sbe3308.htm#fr_141) This rule contains the answer to the question: Who\nis liable for the debts of a deceased person, whose property has been taken by\nhis heirs, whilst his wife through poverty has acceded to another man, and\nwhilst his son remains both penniless and deprived of the protection of his\nmother? The decision is as follows. Between those three, the heir of the\nwealth and no other is liable for the debt. Where, however, there is no heir,\nowing to the want of assets, there the son is liable, if there is no widow;\nand the widow's husband, if there is no son. The respective liability of the\nson and of the taker of the widow depends on the circumstances of the case. If\nthe widow is a young and handsome woman of high origin, her second husband has\nto discharge the debt of her first husband, according to the maxim that she is\nconsidered as his property (see above, paragraph 22). If, however, she is kept\nlike a handmaid and receives a mere livelihood from the man who has taken her,\nthe son is bound to pay the debt. A. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 51.\n\n[48:24](sbe3308.htm#fr_142) The term uttama 'the first,' besides its ordinary\nmeaning, conveys a secondary meaning. It implies that when any of the seven\nSvairi _n_ is and Punarbhus happens to be specially handsome or p. 49 gifted,\nher second husband is bound to pay the debts contracted by the first. A. This,\nno doubt, is a highly artificial interpretation. A definition of the seven\nPunarbhus and Svairi _n_ is is given further on, XII, 46-53. A. refers to XII,\n48 and 52. However, the meaning of the term 'the first Punarbhu' is defined in\nXII, 46. The Mitakshara (p. 77) and Viramitrodaya (p. 347) explain the term\n'the last of the Svairi _n_ is' as referring to one who, overwhelmed with\ndistress, delivers herself to another man. See XII, 51, and note.\n\n[49:25](sbe3308.htm#fr_143) 25 b. This paragraph, which contains a rule\nrelative to the law of inheritance, seems to be a marginal gloss, which has\nsomehow crept into the text by mistake.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 2.
