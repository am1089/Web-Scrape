XV.\n\nThe world overrun with trees: they are destroyed by the Prachetasas. Soma\npacifies them, and gives them Marisha to wife: her story: the daughter of the\nnymph Pramlocha. Legend of Kan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81u. Marisha\'s former history. Daksha the son\nof the Prachetasas: his different characters: his sons: his daughters: their\nmarriages and progeny: allusion to Prahlada, his descendant.\n\nWHILST the Prachetasas were thus absorbed in their devotions, the trees spread\nand overshadowed the unprotected earth, and the people perished: the winds\ncould not blow; the sky was shut out by the forests; and mankind was unable to\nlabour for ten thousand years. When the sages, coming forth from the deep,\nbeheld this, they were angry, and, being incensed, wind and flame issued from\ntheir mouths. The strong wind tore up the trees by their roots, and left them\nsear and dry, and the fierce fire consumed them, and the forests were cleared\naway. When Soma (the moon), the sovereign of the vegetable world, beheld all\nexcept a few of the trees destroyed, he went to the patriarchs, the\nPrachetasas, and said, "Restrain your indignation, princes, and listen to me.\nI will form an alliance between you and the trees. Prescient of futurity, I\nhave nourished with my rays this precious maiden, the daughter of the woods.\nShe is called Marisha, and is assuredly the offspring of the trees. She shall\nbe your bride, and the multiplier of the race of Dhruva. From a portion of\nyour lustre and a portion of mine, oh mighty sages, the patriarch Daksha shall\nbe born of her, who, endowed with a part of me, and composed of your vigour,\nshall be as resplendent as fire, and shall multiply the human race.\n\n"There was formerly (said Soma) a sage named Kan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81u, eminent in holy wisdom,\nwho practised pious austerities on the lovely borders of the Gomati river. The\nking of the gods sent the nymph Pramlocha to disturb his penance, and the\nsweet-smiling damsel diverted the sage from his devotions. They lived\ntogether, in the valley of Mandara, for a hundred and fifty years; during\nwhich, the mind of the Muni was wholly given up to enjoyment. At the\nexpiration of this period the\n\np. 111\n\nnymph requested his permission to return to heaven; but the Muni, still fondly\nattached to her, prevailed upon her to remain for some time longer; and the\ngraceful damsel continued to reside for another hundred years, and delight the\ngreat sage by her fascinations. Then again she preferred her suit to be\nallowed to return to the abodes of the gods; and again the Muni desired her to\nremain. At the expiration of more than a century the nymph once more said to\nhim, with a smiling countenance, \'Brahman, I depart;\' but the Muni, detaining\nthe fine-eyed damsel, replied, \'Nay, stay yet a little; you will go hence for\na long period.\' Afraid of incurring an imprecation, the graceful nymph\ncontinued with the sage for nearly two hundred years more, repeatedly asking\nhis permission to go to the region of the king of the gods, but as often\ndesired by him to remain. Dreading to be cursed by him, and excelling in\namiable manners, well knowing also the pain that is inflicted by separation\nfrom an object of affection, she did not quit the Muni, whose mind, wholly\nsubdued by love, became every day more strongly attached to her.\n\n"On one occasion the sage was going forth from their cottage in a great hurry.\nThe nymph asked him where he was going. \'The day,\' he replied, \'is drawing\nfast to a close: I must perform the Sandhya worship, or a duty will be\nneglected.\' The nymph smiled mirthfully as she rejoined, \'Why do you talk,\ngrave sir, of this day drawing to a close: your day is a day of many years, a\nday that must be a marvel to all: explain what this means.\' The Muni said,\n\'Fair damsel, you came to the river-side at dawn; I beheld you then, and you\nthen entered my hermitage. It is now the revolution of evening, and the day is\ngone. What is the meaning of this laughter? Tell me the truth.\' Pramlocha.\nanswered, \'You say rightly,\' venerable Brahman, \'that I came hither at morning\ndawn, but several hundred years have passed since the time of my arrival. This\nis the truth.\' The Muni, on hearing this, was seized with astonishment, and\nasked her how long he had enjoyed her society: to which the nymph replied,\nthat they had lived together nine hundred and seven years, six months, and\nthree days. The Muni asked her if she spoke the truth, or if she was in jest;\nfor it appeared to him that\n\np. 112\n\nthey had spent but one day together: to which Pramlocha replied, that she\nshould not dare at any time to tell him who lived in the path of piety an\nuntruth, but particularly when she had been enjoined by him to inform him what\nhad passed.\n\n"When the Muni, princes, had heard these words, and knew that it was the\ntruth, he began to reproach himself bitterly, exclaiming, \'Fie, fie upon me;\nmy penance has been interrupted; the treasure of the learned and the pious has\nbeen stolen from me; my judgment has been blinded: this woman has been created\nby some one to beguile me: Brahma is beyond the reach of those agitated by the\nwaves of infirmity 1. I had subdued my passions, and was about to attain\ndivine knowledge. This was foreseen by him by whom this girl has been sent\nhither. Fie on the passion that has obstructed my devotions. All the\nausterities that would have led to acquisition of the wisdom of the Vedas have\nbeen rendered of no avail by passion that is the road to hell.\' The pious\nsage, having thus reviled himself, turned to the nymph, who was sitting nigh,\nand said to her, \'Go, deceitful girl, whither thou wilt: thou hast performed\nthe office assigned thee by the monarch of the gods, of disturbing my penance\nby thy fascinations. I will not reduce thee to ashes by the fire of my wrath.\nSeven paces together is sufficient for the friendship of the virtuous, but\nthou and I have dwelt together. And in truth what fault hast thou committed?\nwhy should I be wroth with thee? The sin is wholly mine, in that I could not\nsubdue my passions: yet fie upon thee, who, to gain favour with Indra, hast\ndisturbed my devotions; vile bundle of delusion.\'\n\n"Thus spoken to by the Muni, Pramlocha stood trembling, whilst big drops of\nperspiration started from every pore; till he angrily cried to her, \'Depart,\nbegone.\' She then, reproached by him, went forth from his dwelling, and,\npassing through the air, wiped the perspiration from her person with the\nleaves of the trees. The nymph went from tree to tree, and as with the dusky\nshoots that crowned their summits she dried her limbs, which were covered with\nmoisture, the child she had conceived by\n\np. 113\n\nthe Rishi came forth from the pores of her skin in drops of perspiration. The\ntrees received the living dews, and the winds collected them into one mass.\n"This," said Soma, "I matured by my rays, and gradually it increased in size,\ntill the exhalation that had rested on the tree tops became the lovely girl\nnamed Marisha. The trees will give her to you, Prachetasas: let your\nindignation be appeased. She is the progeny of Kan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81u, the child of\nPramlocha, the nursling of the trees, the daughter of the wind and of the\nmoon. The holy Kan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81u, after the interruption of his pious exercises, went,\nexcellent princes, to the region of Vishn\xcc\x81u, termed Purushottama, where,\nMaitreya 2, with his whole mind he devoted himself to the adoration of Hari;\nstanding fixed, with uplifted arms, and repeating the prayers that comprehend\nthe essence of divine truth 3."\n\nThe Prachetasas said, "We are desirous to hear the transcendental\n\np. 114\n\nprayers, by inaudibly reciting which the pious Kan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81u propitiated Ke\xc5\x9bava." On\nwhich Soma repeated as follows: "\'Vishn\xcc\x81u is beyond the boundary of all\nthings: he is the infinite: he is beyond that which is boundless: he is above\nall that is above: he exists as finite truth: he is the object of the Veda;\nthe limit of elemental being; unappreciable by the senses; possessed of\nillimitable might: he is the cause of cause; the cause of the cause of cause;\nthe cause of finite cause; and in effects, he, both as every object and agent,\npreserves the universe: he is Brahma the lord; Brahma all beings; Brahma the\nprogenitor of all beings; the imperishable: he is the eternal, undecaying,\nunborn Brahma, incapable of increase or diminution: Purushottama is the\neverlasting, untreated, immutable Brahma. May the imperfections of my nature\nbe annihilated through his favour.\' Reciting this eulogium, the essence of\ndivine truth, and propitiating Ke\xc5\x9bava, Kan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81u obtained final emancipation.\n\n"Who Marisha was of old I will also relate to you, as the recital of her\nmeritorious acts will be beneficial to you. She was the widow of a prince, and\nleft childless at her husband\'s death: she therefore zealously worshipped\nVishn\xcc\x81u, who, being gratified by her adoration, appeared to her, and desired\nher to demand a boon; on which she revealed to him the wishes of her heart. \'I\nhave been a widow, lord,\' she exclaimed, \'even from my infancy, and my birth\nhas been in vain: unfortunate have I been, and of little use, oh sovereign of\nthe world. Now therefore I pray thee that in succeeding births I may have\nhonourable husbands, and a son equal to a patriarch amongst men: may I be\npossessed of affluence and beauty: may I he pleasing in the sight of all: and\nmay I be born out of the ordinary course. Grant these prayers, oh thou who art\npropitious to the devout.\' Hrishike\xc5\x9ba, the god of gods, the supreme giver of\nall blessings, thus prayed to, raised her from her prostrate attitude, and\nsaid, \'In another life you shall have ten husbands of mighty prowess, and\nrenowned for glorious acts; and you shall have a son magnanimous and valiant,\ndistinguished by the rank of a patriarch, from whom the various races of men\nshall multiply, and by whose posterity the universe shall be filled. You,\nvirtuous lady, shall be of marvellous birth, and you shall be endowed with\ngrace and loveliness, delighting the\n\np. 115\n\nhearts of men.\' Thus having spoken, the deity disappeared, and the princess\nwas accordingly afterwards born as Marisha, who is given to you for a wife 4."\n\nSoma having concluded, the Prachetasas took Marisha, as he had enjoined them,\nrighteously to wife, relinquishing their indignation against the trees: and\nupon her they begot the eminent patriarch Daksha, who had (in a former life)\nbeen born as the son of Brahma 5. This great sage, for the furtherance of\ncreation, and the increase of mankind, created progeny. Obeying the command of\nBrahma, he made movable and immovable things, bipeds and quadrupeds; and\nsubsequently, by his will, gave birth to females, ten of whom he bestowed on\nDharma, thirteen on Ka\xc5\x9byapa, and twenty-seven, who regulate the course of\ntime, on the moon 6. Of these, the gods, the Titans, the snake-gods, cattle,\nand birds, the singers and dancers of the courts of heaven, the spirits of\nevil, and other beings, were born. From that period forwards living creatures\n\np. 116\n\nwere engendered by sexual intercourse: before the time of Daksha they were\nvariously propagated, by the will, by sight, by touch, and by the influence of\nreligious austerities practised by devout sages and holy saints.\n\nMAITREYA.--Daksha, as I have formerly heard, was born from the right thumb of\nBrahma: tell me, great Muni, how he was regenerate as the son of the\nPrachetasas. Considerable perplexity also arises in my mind, how he, who, as\nthe son of Marisha, was the grandson of Soma, could be also his father-in-law.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--Birth and death are constant in all creatures: Rishis and sages,\npossessing divine vision, are not perplexed by this. Daksha and the other\neminent Munis are present in every age, and in the interval of destruction\ncease to be 7: of this the wise man entertains no doubt. Amongst them of old\nthere was neither senior nor junior; rigorous penance and acquired power were\nthe sole causes of any difference of degree amongst these more than human\nbeings.\n\np. 117\n\nMAITREYA.--Narrate to me, venerable Brahman, at length, the birth of the gods,\nTitans, Gandharbas, serpents, and goblins.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--In what manner Daksha created living creatures, as commanded by\nBrahma, you shall hear. In the first place he willed into existence the\ndeities, the Rishis, the quiristers of heaven, the Titans, and the snake-gods.\nFinding that his will-born progeny did not multiply themselves, he determined,\nin order to secure their increase, to establish sexual intercourse as the\nmeans of multiplication. For this purpose he espoused Asikni, the daughter of\nthe patriarch Viran\xcc\x81a 8, a damsel addicted to devout practices, the eminent\nsupportress of the world. By her the great father of mankind begot five\nthousand mighty sons, through whom he expected the world should be peopled.\nNarada, the divine Rishi, observing them desirous to multiply posterity,\napproached them, and addressed them in a friendly tone: "Illustrious\nHaryaswas, it is evident that your intention is to beget posterity; but first\nconsider this: why should you, who, like fools, know not the middle, the\nheight, and depth of the world 9, propagate offspring? When your intellect is\nno more obstructed by interval, height, or depth, then how, fools, shall ye\nnot all behold the term of the universe?" Having heard the words of Narada,\nthe sons of Daksha dispersed themselves through the regions, and to the\npresent day have not returned; as rivers that lose themselves in the ocean\ncome back no more.\n\nThe Haryaswas having disappeared, the patriarch Daksha begot by the daughter\nof Viran\xcc\x81a a thousand other sons. They, who were named Savalaswas, were\ndesirous of engendering posterity, but were dissuaded by Narada in a similar\nmanner. They said to one another, "What the Muni has observed is perfectly\njust. We must follow the path that our\n\np. 118\n\nbrothers have travelled, and when we have ascertained the extent of the\nuniverse, we will multiply our race." Accordingly they scattered themselves\nthrough the regions, and, like rivers flowing into the sea, they returned not\nagain. Henceforth brother seeking for brother disappears, through ignorance of\nthe products of the first principle of things. Daksha the patriarch, on\nfinding that all these his sons had vanished, was incensed, and denounced an\nimprecation upon Narada 10.\n\np. 119\n\nThen, Maitreya, the wise patriarch, it is handed down to us, being anxious to\npeople the world, created sixty daughters of the daughter of Viran\xcc\x81a 11; ten\nof whom he gave to Dharma, thirteen to Ka\xc5\x9byapa, and twenty-seven to Soma, four\nto Arisht\xcc\x81anemi, two to Bahuputra, two to Angiras, and two to Kri\xc5\x9ba\xc5\x9bwa. I will\ntell you their names. Arundhat\xcc\x81i, Vasu, Yami, Lamba, Bhanu, Marutwati,\nSankalpa, Muhurtta, Sadhya, and Vi\xc5\x9bwa were the ten wives of Dharma 12, and\nbore him the following\n\np. 120\n\nprogeny. The sons of Vi\xc5\x9bwa were the Vi\xc5\x9bwadevas 13; and the Sadhyas 14, those\nof Sadhya. The Maruts, or winds, were the children of Marutwati; the Vasus, of\nVasu. The Bhanus (or suns) of Bhanu; and the deities presiding over moments,\nof Muhurtta. Ghosha was the son of Lamba (an arc of the heavens); Nagavithi\n(the milky way), the daughter of Yami (night). The divisions of the earth were\nborn of Arundhat\xcc\x81i; and Sankalpa (pious purpose), the soul of all, was the son\nof Sankalpa. The deities called Vasus, because, preceded by fire, they abound\nin splendour and might 15, are severally named \xc3\x81pa, Dhruva, Soma, Dhava\n(fire), Anila (wind), Anala (fire), Pratyusha (day-break), and Prabhasa\n(light). The four sons of \xc3\x81pa were Vaitan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ya, \xc5\x9arama (weariness), Sranta\n(fatigue), and Dhur (burthen). Kala (time), the cherisher of the world, was\nthe son of Dhruva. The son of Soma was Varchas (light), who was the father of\nVarchaswi (radiance). Dhava had, by his wife Manohara (loveliness), Dravin\xcc\x81a,\nHutahavyavaha, \xc5\x9ai\xc5\x9bira, Pran\xcc\x81a, and Raman\xcc\x81a. The two sons of Anila (wind), by\nhis wife \xc5\x9aiva, were Manojava (swift as thought) and Avijnatagati (untraceable\nmotion). The son of Agni (fire), Kumara, was born in a clump of \xc5\x9aara reeds:\nhis sons were Sakha, Visakha, Naigameya, and Prisht\xcc\x81haja. The offspring of the\nKrittikas was named Kartikeya. The son of Pratyusha was the Rishi named\nDevala, who had two philosophic and intelligent sons 16. The sister of\nVachaspati, lovely and virtuous, Yogasiddha, who pervades the wholes world\nwithout\n\np. 121\n\nbeing devoted to it, was the wife of Prabhasa, the eighth of the Vasus, and\nbore to him the patriarch Viswakarma, the author of a thousand arts, the\nmechanist of the gods, the fabricator of all ornaments, the chief of artists,\nthe constructor of the self-moving chariots of the deities, and by whose skill\nmen obtain subsistence. Ajaikapad, Ahirvradhna, and the wise Rudra Twasht\xcc\x81ri,\nwere born; and the self-born son of Twashtri was also the celebrated\nVi\xc5\x9bwarupa. There are eleven well-known Rudras, lords of the three worlds, or\nHara, Bahurupa, Tryambaka, Aparajita, Vrishakapi, Sambhu, Kaparddi, Raivata,\nMrigavyadha, Sarva, and Kapali 17; but there are a hundred appellations of the\nimmeasurably mighty Rudras 18.\n\np. 122\n\nThe daughters of Daksha who were married to Ka\xc5\x9byapa were Aditi, Diti, Danu,\nArisht\xcc\x81a, Surasa, Surabhi, Vinata, Tamra, Krodhava\xc5\x9ba, Id\xcc\x81a, Khasa, Kadru, and\nMuni 19; whose progeny I will describe to you. There were twelve celebrated\ndeities in a former Manwantara, called Tushitas 20, who, upon the approach of\nthe present period, or in the reign of the last Manu, Chakshusha, assembled,\nand said to one another, "Come, let us quickly enter into the womb of Aditi,\nthat we may be born in the next Manwantara, for thereby we shall again enjoy\nthe rank of gods:" and accordingly they were born the sons of Ka\xc5\x9byapa, the son\nof Marichi, by Aditi, the daughter of Daksha; thence named the twelve \xc3\x81dityas;\nwhose appellations were respectively, Vishn\xcc\x81u, \xc5\x9aakra, \xc3\x81ryaman, Dhuti,\nTwasht\xcc\x81ri, Pushan, Vivaswat, Savitri, Mitra, Varun\xcc\x81a, An\xc5\x9ba, and Bhaga 21.\nThese, who in the Chakshusha Manwantara were the gods called Tushitas, were\ncalled the twelve \xc3\x81dityas in the Manwantara of Vaiva\xc5\x9bwata.\n\nThe twenty-seven daughters of the patriarch who became the virtuous wives of\nthe moon were all known as the nymphs of the lunar constellations,\n\np. 123\n\nwhich were called by their names, and had children who were brilliant through\ntheir great splendour 22. The wives of Arisht\xcc\x81anemi bore him sixteen children\n23. The daughters of Bahuputra were the four lightnings 24. The excellent\nPratyangirasa Richas were the children of Angiras 25, descended from the holy\nsage: and the deified weapons of the gods 26 were the progeny of Kri\xc5\x9ba\xc5\x9bwa.\n\nThese classes of thirty-three divinities 27 are born again at the end of a\nthousand ages, according to their own pleasure; and their appearance and\ndisappearance is here spoken of as birth and death: but, Maitreya, these\ndivine personages exist age after age in the same manner as the sun sets and\nrises again.\n\nIt has been related to us, that Diti had two sons by Ka\xc5\x9byapa, named\nHiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu and the invincible Hiran\xcc\x81yaksha: she had also a daughter,\n\np. 124\n\n[paragraph continues] Sinka, the wife of Viprachitti. Hiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu was the\nfather of four mighty sons, Anuhlada, Hlada, the wise Prahlada, and the heroic\nSanhlada, the augmentor of the Daitya race 28. Amongst these, the illustrious\nPrahlada, looking on all things with indifference, devoted his whole faith to\nJanarddana. The flames that were lighted by the king of the Daityas consumed\nnot him, in whose heart Vasudeva was cherished; and all the earth trembled\nwhen, bound with bonds, he moved amidst the waters of the ocean. His firm\nbody, fortified by a mind engrossed by Achyuta, was unwounded by the weapons\nhurled on him by order of the Daitya monarch; and the serpents sent to destroy\nhim breathed their venomous flames upon him in vain. Overwhelmed with rocks,\nhe yet remained unhurt; for he never forgot Vishn\xcc\x81u, and the recollection of\nthe deity was his armour of proof. Hurled from on high by the king of the\nDaityas, residing in Swerga, earth received him unharmed. The wind sent into\nhis body to wither him up was itself annihilated by him, in whom Madhusudana\nwas present. The fierce elephants of the spheres broke their tusks, and vailed\ntheir pride, against the firm breast which the lord of the Daityas had ordered\nthem to assault. The ministrant priests of the monarch were baffled in all\ntheir rites for the destruction of one so steadily attached to Govinda: and\nthe thousand delusions of the fraudulent Samvara, counteracted by the discus\nof Krishn\xcc\x81a, were practised without success. The deadly poison administered by\nhis father\'s officers he partook of unhesitatingly, and without its working\nany visible change; for he looked upon the world with mind undisturbed, and,\nfull of benignity, regarded all things with equal affection, and as identical\nwith himself. He was righteous; an inexhaustible mine of purity and truth; and\nan unfailing model for all pious men.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[112:1](vp050.htm#fr_278) Or, \'immersed in the six \xc3\x9armis\'; explained hunger,\nthirst, sorrow, stupefaction, decay, and death.\n\n[113:2](vp050.htm#fr_279) There is some confusion here in regard to the person\naddressed, but the context shews that the insertion of Maitreya\'s name is an\ninadvertence, and that the passage is a continuation of Soma\'s speech to the\nPrachetasas.\n\n[113:3](vp050.htm#fr_280) The phrase is \'made up of the farther boundary of\nBrahma;\' implying either \'comprehending the supreme, or Brahma, and\ntranscendental wisdom, Para;\' or, consisting of the farthest limits (Para) or\ntruths of the Vedas or Brahma;\' that is, being the essence of the Vedanta\nphilosophy. The hymn that follows is in fact a mantra or mystical prayer,\ncommencing with the reiteration of the word Para and Para; as, ###. Para means\n\'supreme, infinite; and Para, \'the farther bank or limit,\' the point that is\nto be attained by crossing a river or sea, or figuratively the world or\nexistence. Vishn\xcc\x81u, then, is Para, that which nothing surpasses; and Para, the\nend or object of existence: he is Apara para, the farthest bound of that which\nis illimitable, or space and time: he is Param parebhyah, above or beyond the\nhighest, being beyond or superior to all the elements: he is Paramartha rupi,\nor identical with final truth, or knowledge of soul: he is Brahma para, the\nobject or essence of spiritual wisdom. Paraparabhuta is said to imply the\nfarther limit (Para) of rudimental matter (Para). He is Para, or chief\nParanam, of those objects which are beyond the senses: and he is Parapara, or\nthe boundary of boundaries; that is, he is the comprehensive in-vesture of,\nand exterior to, those limits by which soul is confined; he is free from all\nincumbrance or impediment. The passage may be interpreted in different ways,\naccording to the ingenuity with which the riddle is read.\n\n[115:4](vp050.htm#fr_281) This part of the legend is peculiar to our text, and\nthe whole story of Marisha\'s birth is nowhere else so fully detailed. The\npenance of the Prachetasas, and its consequences, are related in the Agni,\nBhagavata, Matsya, Padma, Vayu, and Brahma Puran\xcc\x81as, and allusion is briefly\nmade to Marisha\'s birth. Her origin from Kan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81u and Pramlocha is narrated in\na different place in the Brahma Puran\xcc\x81a, where the austerities of Kan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81u, and\nthe necessity for their interruption, are described. The story, from that\nauthority, was translated by the late Professor Chezy, and is published in the\nfirst number of the Journal Asiatique.\n\n[115:5](vp050.htm#fr_282) The second birth of Daksha, and his share in the\npeopling of the earth, is narrated in most of the Puran\xcc\x81as in a similar\nmanner. It is perhaps the original legend, for Daksha seems to be an irregular\nadjunct to the Prajapatis, or mind-born sons of Brahma (see [p.\n49](vp041.htm#page_49). n. [2](vp041.htm#fn_200)); and the allegorical nature\nof his posterity in that character ([p. 54](vp041.htm#page_54)) intimates a\nmore recent origin. Nor does that series of descendants apparently occur in\nthe Mahabharata, although the existence of two Dakshas is especially remarked\nthere (Moksha Dh.). In the \xc3\x81di Parva, which seems to be the freest from\nsubsequent improvements, the Daksha noticed is the son of the Prachetasas. The\nincompatibility of the two accounts is reconciled by referring the two Dakshas\nto different Manwantaras. The Daksha who proceeded from Brahma as a Prajapati\nbeing born in the first, or Swayambhuva, and the son of the Prachetasas in the\nChakshusha Manwantara. The latter however, as descended from Uttanapada,\nshould belong to the first period also. It is evident that great confusion has\nbeen made by the Puran\xcc\x81as in Daksha\'s history.\n\n[115:6](vp050.htm#fr_283) That is, they are the Nakshatras, or lunar\nasterisms.\n\n[116:7](vp050.htm#fr_284) \'They are removed\', which the commentator explains\nby \'are absorbed, as if they were fast asleep;\' but in every age or Yuga,\naccording to the text--in every Manwantara, according to the comment--the\nRishis reappear, the circumstances of their origin only being varied. Daksha\ntherefore, as remarked in the preceding note, is the son of Brahma in one\nperiod, the son of the Prachetasas in another. So Soma, in the Swayambhuva\nManwantara, was born as the son of Atri; in the Chakshusha, he was produced by\nchurning the ocean. The words of our text occur in the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba, with an\nunimportant variation: \'Birth and obstruction are constant in all beings, but\nRishis and those men who are wise are not perplexed by this;\' that is, not, as\nrendered above, by the alternation of life and death; but, according to the\ncommentator on the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba, by a very different matter, the prohibition of\nunlawful marriages. Utpatti, \'birth of progeny,\' is the result of their will;\nNirodha, \'obstruction,\' is the law prohibiting the intermarriage of persons\nconnected by the offering of the funeral cake; to which Rishis and sages are\nnot subject, either from their matrimonial unions being merely platonic, or\nfrom the bad example set by Brahma, who, according to the Vedas, approached\nhis own daughter; we have already had occasion to advert to ([p.\n51](vp041.htm#page_51). n. [5](vp041.htm#fn_203)). The explanation of the\ntext, however, given by the commentator appears forced, and less natural than\nthe interpretation preferred above.\n\n[117:8](vp050.htm#fr_285) This is the usual account of Daksha\'s marriage, and\nis that of the Mahabharata, Adi P. (p. 113), and of the Brahma Puran\xcc\x81a, which\nthe Hari Van\xc5\x9ba, in the first part, repeats. In another portion, the Pushkara\nMahatmya, however, Daksha, it is said, converts half himself into a female, by\nwhom he begets the daughters presently to be noticed: ###. This seems to be\nmerely a new edition of an old story.\n\n[117:9](vp050.htm#fr_286) The commentator explains it to mean the origin,\nduration, and termination of subtile rudimental body; but the Padma and Linga\nP. distinctly express it, \'the extent of the earth.\'\n\n[118:10](vp050.htm#fr_287) Narada\'s interference, and the fruitless generation\nof the first progeny of Daksha, is an old legend. The Mahabharata (\xc3\x81di P. p.\n113) notices only one set of sons, who, it is said, obtained Moksha, or\nliberation, through Nareda\'s teaching them the Sankhya philosophy. The Brahma,\nMatsya, Vayu, Linga, Padma, Agni, and Bhagavata Puran\xcc\x81as tell the story much\nas in the text, and not unfrequently in the same words. In general they merely\nrefer to the imprecation denounced upon Narada, as above. The Bhagavata\nspecifies the imprecation to be perpetual peripateticism. Daksha says to him,\n\'There shall not be a resting-place for thee in all these regions.\' The Kurma\nrepeats the imprecation merely to the effect that Narada shall perish, and\ngives no legend. In the Brahma Vaivartta, Narada is cursed by Brahma, on a\nsimilar occasion, to become the chief of the Gandharbas, whence his musical\npropensities: but the Bhagavata, VI. 7, has the reverse of this legend, and\nmakes him first a Gandharba, then a \xc5\x9audra, then the son of Brahma. The Brahma\nP., and after it the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba and the Vayu P., have a different and not very\nintelligible story. Daksha, being about to pronounce an imprecation upon\nNarada, was appeased by Brahma and the Rishis, and it was agreed between them\nthat Narada should be again born, as the son of Ka\xc5\x9byapa, by one of Daksha\'s\ndaughters. This seems to be the gist of the legend, but it is very confusedly\ntold. The version of the Brahma P., which is the same as that of Hari Van\xc5\x9ba,\nmay be thus rendered: "The smooth-speaking Narada addressed the sons of Daksha\nfor their destruction and his own; for the Muni Ka\xc5\x9byapa begot him as a son,\nwho was the son of Brahma, on the daughter of Daksha, through fear of the\nlatter\'s imprecation. He was formerly the son of Paramesht\xcc\x81hi (Brahma), and\nthe excellent sage Ka\xc5\x9byapa next begot him, as if he were his father, on\nAsikni, the daughter of Viran\xcc\x81a. Whilst he was engaged in beguiling the sons\nof the patriarch, Daksha, of resistless power, determined on his destruction;\nbut he was solicited by Brahma, in the presence of the great sages, and it was\nagreed between them that Narada, the son of Brahma, should be born of a\ndaughter of Daksha. Consequently Daksha gave his daughter to Paramesht\xcc\x81hi, and\nby her was Narada born." Now several difficulties occur here. Asikni is the\nwife, not the daughter, of Daksha; but this may be a blunder of the compiler,\nfor in the parallel passage of the Vayu no name occurs. In the next place, who\nis this daughter? for, as we shall see, the progeny of all Daksha\'s daughters\nare fully detailed, and in no p. 119 authority consulted is Narada mentioned\nas the son of either of them, or as the son of Ka\xc5\x9byapa. Daksha, too, gives his\ndaughter, not to Ka\xc5\x9byapa, but to Paramesht\xcc\x81hi, or Brahma. The commentator on\nthe Hari Van\xc5\x9ba solves this by saying he gives her to Brahma for Ka\xc5\x9byapa. The\nsame bargain is noticed in the Vayu, but Narada is also said there to be\nadopted by Ka\xc5\x9byapa. Again, however, it gives Daksha\'s imprecation in the same\nwords as the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba; a passage, by the way, omitted in the Brahma:\n\'Narada, perish (in your present form), and take up your abode in the womb.\'\nWhatever may be the original of this legend, it is evidently imperfectly given\nby the authorities here cited. The French translation of the passage in the\nHari Van\xc5\x9ba can scarcely be admitted as correct: assuredly is not \'le Devarchi\nDakcha, epoux d\'\'Asikni, fille de Virana, fut l\'aieul de cet illustri mouni\nainsi regenere.\' ### is more consistently said by the commentator to mean\nKa\xc5\x9byapa. The Vayu P. in another part, a description of the different orders of\nRishis, states that the Devarshis Parvata and Nareda were sons of Ka\xc5\x9byapa: In\nthe account of Karttavirya, in the Brahma P. and Hari Van\xc5\x9ba, Narada is\nintroduced as a Gandharba, the son of Varidasa; being the same, according to\nthe commentator on the latter, as the Gandharba elsewhere called Upavarhana.\n\n[119:11](vp050.htm#fr_288) The prior specification (p. 115) was fifty. The\nMahabharata, Adi P. 113, and, again, Moksha Dharma, has the same number. The\nBhagavata, Kurma, Padma, Linga, and Vayu P. state sixty. The former is perhaps\nthe original, as the fullest and most consistent details relate to them and\ntheir posterity.\n\n[119:12](vp050.htm#fr_289) This is the usual list of Dharma\'s wives. The\nBhagavata substitutes Kakud for Arundhat\xcc\x81i. The Padma P., Matsya P., and Hari\nVan\xc5\x9ba contain two different account of Daksha\'s descendants: the first agrees\nwith our text; the second, which is supposed to occur in the Padma Kalpa, is\nsomewhat varied, particularly as to the wives of Dharma, who are said to be\nfive. The nomenclature varies, or,\n\n   Padma P.  \n\n|\n\n   Hari Van\xc5\x9ba.  \n\n|\n\n   Matsya.  \n  \n---|---|---  \n  \nLakshmi\n\n|\n\nLakshmi\n\n|\n\nLakshmi  \n  \nSaraswati\n\n|\n\nKirtti\n\n|\n\nSaraswati  \n  \nGanga\n\n|\n\nSadhya\n\n|\n\nSadhya  \n  \nVi\xc5\x9bwe\xc5\x9ba\n\n|\n\nVi\xc5\x9bwa\n\n|\n\nVi\xc5\x9bwe\xc5\x9ba  \n  \nSavitri\n\n|\n\nMarutwati\n\n|\n\nUrjjaswati.  \n  \nThere is evident inaccuracy in all the copies, and the names may in some\ninstances be erroneous. From the succeeding enumeration of their descendants,\nit appears that Kama was the son of Lakshmi; the p. 120 Sadhyas, of Sadhya;\nthe Vi\xc5\x9bwadevas, of Vi\xc5\x9bwa; the Maruts, of Marutwati; and the Vasus, of Devi,\nwho may be either the Saraswati or Savitri of the previous enumeration.\n\n[120:13](vp050.htm#fr_290) The Vi\xc5\x9bwadevas are a class of gods to whom\nsacrifices should be offered daily. Manu, III. 121. They are named in some of\nthe Puran\xcc\x81as, as the Vayu and Matsya: the former specifying ten; the latter,\ntwelve.\n\n[120:14](vp050.htm#fr_291) The Sadhyas, according to the Vayu, are the\npersonified rites and prayers of the Vedas, born of the metres, and partakers\nof the sacrifices. The same work names twelve, which are all names of\nsacrifices and formulae, as Dar\xc5\x9ba, Paurnamasa, Vrihada\xc5\x9bwa, Rathantara, &c. The\nMatsya P., Padma P., and Hari V. have a different set of seventeen\nappellations, apparently of arbitrary selection, as Bhava, Prabhava, \xc3\x8d\xc5\x9ba,\nArun\xcc\x81i, &c.\n\n[120:15](vp050.htm#fr_292) Or, according to the Padma P., because they are\nalways present in light, or luminous irradiation.\n\n[120:16](vp050.htm#fr_293) The Vayu supplies their names, Kshamavartta\n(patient) and Manaswin (wise).\n\n[121:17](vp050.htm#fr_294) The passage is, ### Whose sons they are does not\nappear; the object being, according to the comment, to specify only the eleven\ndivisions or modifications of the youngest Rudra, Twasht\xcc\x81a.\' We have, however,\nan unusual variety of reading here in two copies of the comment: \'The eleven\nRudras, in whom the family of Twasht\xcc\x81ri (a synonyme, it may be observed,\nsometimes of Viswakarma) is included, were born. The enumeration of the Rudras\nends with Aparajita, of whom Tryambaka is the epithet.\' Accordingly the three\nlast names in all the other copies of the text are omitted in these two; their\nplaces being supplied by the three first, two of whom are always named in the\nlists of the Rudras. According to the Vayu and Brahma P. the Rudras are the\nchildren of Ka\xc5\x9byapa by Surabhi: the Bhagavata makes them the progeny of Bhuta\nand Sarupa: the Matsya, Padma, and Hari V., in the second series, the\noffspring of Surabhi by Brahma. The names in three of the Pauran\xcc\x81ic\nauthorities run thus:\n\n      Vayu.       \n\n|\n\n      Matsya.       \n\n|\n\n      Bhagavata.         \n  \n---|---|---  \n  \nAjaikapad\n\n|\n\nAjaikapad\n\n|\n\nAjaikapad  \n  \nAhirvradhna\n\n|\n\nAhirvradhna\n\n|\n\nAhirvradhna  \n  \nHara\n\n|\n\nHama\n\n|\n\nUgra  \n  \nNirrita\n\n|\n\nNirritti\n\n|\n\nBhima  \n  \n\xc3\x8d\xc5\x9bwara\n\n|\n\nPingala\n\n|\n\nVama  \n  \nBhuvana\n\n|\n\nDahana\n\n|\n\nMahan  \n  \nAngaraka\n\n|\n\nAparajita\n\n|\n\nBahurupa  \n  \nArddhaketu\n\n|\n\nMrigavyadha\n\n|\n\nVrishakapi  \n  \nMrityu\n\n|\n\nSenani\n\n|\n\nAja  \n  \nSarpa\n\n|\n\nSajja\n\n|\n\nBhava  \n  \nKapali\n\n|\n\nKapali\n\n|\n\nRaivata.  \n  \n[paragraph continues] The Brahma or Hari V., the Padma, the Linga, &c. have\nother varieties; and the Lexicons have a different reading from all, as in\nthat of Jat\xcc\x81adhara they are Ajaikapad, Ahivradhna, Virupaksha, Sure\xc5\x9bwara,\nJayanta, Bahurupaka, Tryambaka, Aparajita, Vaiva\xc5\x9bwata, \xc5\x9aavitra, and Hara. The\nvariety seems to proceed from the writers applying to the Rudras, as they may\nlegitimately do, different appellations of the common prototype, or synonymes\nof Rudra or \xc5\x9aiva, selected at will from his thousand and eight names,\naccording to the Linga P.\n\n[121:18](vp050.htm#fr_295) The posterity of Daksha\'s daughters p. 122 by\nDharma are clearly allegorical personifications chiefly of two classes, one\nconsisting of astronomical phenomena, and the other of portions or subjects of\nthe ritual of the Vedas.\n\n[122:19](vp050.htm#fr_296) There is some, though not much, variation in these\nnames in different Puran\xcc\x81as. The Bhagavata has Sarama, Kasht\xcc\x81ha, and Timi, the\nparents severally of canine animals, beasts with uncloven hoofs, and fishes,\nin place of Vinata, Khasa, and Kadru; disposing of the first and last\ndifferently. The Vayu has Prava in place of Arisht\xcc\x81a, and Anayush or Danayush\nfor Surasa. The Padma P., second series, substitutes Kala, Anayush, Sinhika,\nPi\xc5\x9bacha, Vach for Arisht\xcc\x81a, Surasa, Surabhi, Tamra, and Muni; and omits Id\xcc\x81a\nand Khasa. In the Uttara Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a of the same, Ka\xc5\x9byapa\'s wives are said to be\nbut four, Aditi, Diti, Kadru, and Vinata.\n\n[122:20](vp050.htm#fr_297) In the sixth reign, or that of Chakshusha Manu,\naccording to the text; but in book III. ch. 1. the Tushitas are the gods of\nthe second or Swarochisha Manwantara. The Vayu has a much more complete legend\nthan any other Pura on this subject. In the beginning of the Kalpa twelve\ngods, named Jayas, were created by Brahma, as his deputies and assistants in\nthe creation. They, lost in meditation, neglected his commands; on which he\ncursed them to be repeatedly born in each Manwantara till the seventh. They\nwere accordingly, in the several successive Manwantaras, Ajitas, Tushitas,\nSatyas, Haris, Vaikunthas, Sadhyas, and \xc3\x81dityas. Our authority and some\nothers, as the Brahma, have apparently intended to refer to this account, but\nhave confused the order of the series.\n\n[122:21](vp050.htm#fr_298) p. 123 The Puran\xcc\x81as that contain this genealogy\nagree tolerably well in these names. The Bhagavata adds many details regarding\nsome of the \xc3\x81dityas and their descendants.\n\n[123:22](vp050.htm#fr_299) The Nakshatra Yoginis, or chief stars of the lunar\nmansions, or asterisms in the moon\'s path.\n\n[123:23](vp050.htm#fr_300) None of the authorities are more specific on the\nsubject of Arisht\xcc\x81anemis\' progeny. In the Mahabharata this is said to be\nanother name of Ka\xc5\x9byapa. The Bhagavata substitutes Tarksha for this personage,\nsaid by the commentator to be likewise another name of Ka\xc5\x9byapa. His wives are,\nKadru, Vinata, Patangi, and Yamini, mothers of snakes, birds, grasshoppers,\nand locusts.\n\n[123:24](vp050.htm#fr_301) Enumerated in astrological works as brown, red,\nyellow, and white; portending severally wind, heat, rain, famine.\n\n[123:25](vp050.htm#fr_302) The Richas, or verses, thirty-five in number,\naddressed to presiding divinities, denominated Pratyangirasas. The Bhagavata\ncalls the wives of Anginas, Swadha and Sati, and makes them the mothers of the\nPitris and the Atharvan Veda severally.\n\n[123:26](vp050.htm#fr_303) The \xc5\x9aastra devatas, \'gods of the divine weapons;\' a\nhundred are enumerated in the Ramayan\xcc\x81a, and they are there termed the sons of\nKri\xc5\x9ba\xc5\x9bwa by Jaya and Vijaya, daughters of the Prajapati; that is, of Daksha.\nThe Bhagavata terms the two wives of Kri\xc5\x9ba\xc5\x9bwa, Archish (flame) and Dhishan\xcc\x81a;\nthe former is the mother of Dhumaketu (comet); the latter, of four sages,\nDevala, Veda\xc5\x9biras, Vayun\xcc\x81a, and Manu. The allegorical origin of the weapons is\nundoubtedly the more ancient.\n\n[123:27](vp050.htm#fr_304) This number is founded upon a text of the Vedas,\nwhich to the eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, and twelve \xc3\x81dityas, adds Prajapati,\neither Brahma or Daksha, and Vashatkara, \'deified oblation.\' They have the\nepithet Chhandaja, as born in different Manwantaras, of their own will.\n\n[124:28](vp050.htm#fr_305) The Puran\xcc\x81as generally concur in this genealogy,\nreading sometimes Anuhrada, Hrada, &c. for Anuhlada and the rest. Although\nplaced second in the order of Ka\xc5\x9byapa\'s descendants, the Daityas are in fact\nthe elder branch. Thus the Mahabharata, Moksha Dherma, calls Diti the senior\nwife of Ka\xc5\x9byapa: and the Vayu terms Hiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu and Hiran\xcc\x81yaksha the eldest\nof all the sons of that patriarch. "Titan and his enormous brood" were\n"heaven\'s first born."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XVI](vp051.htm)\n\n'
