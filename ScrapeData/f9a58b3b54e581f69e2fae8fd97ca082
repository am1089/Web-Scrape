I bring a prayer to the worshipper, the renowned sage, the glorious,\nancient one. Agni is the highly gracious Asura, taking his seat in gh _ri_ ta,\nthe holder of wealth, supporting goods.\n\n2\\. By _Ri_ ta they have supported the supporting _Ri_ ta, near the powerful\n(performer) [1](sbe46119.htm#an_5:15:2:1) of sacrifice, in highest heaven, the\nmen who sit [2](sbe46119.htm#an_5:15:2:2) on the supporting support of the\nsky, and who with born (men) attained to the unborn.\n\n3\\. Dispelling anguish [1](sbe46119.htm#an_5:15:3:1) they spread out for the\nancient one [2](sbe46119.htm#an_5:15:3:2) his bodies\n[3](sbe46119.htm#an_5:15:3:3), mighty vital power, difficult to overcome. May\nhe, the new-born, traverse the spaces. They have stood round him as round an\nangry lion.\n\n4\\. When thou carriest, spreading out, man after man like a mother, for their\nnourishment and for their sight, when thou growest old\n[1](sbe46119.htm#an_5:15:4:1) assuming life after life, thou goest around by\nthyself in manifold shapes.\n\n5\\. May gain protect now the boundaries of thy strength, the wide, firmly\nsupporting milkstream [1](sbe46119.htm#an_5:15:5:1) of wealth, O god! Putting\ndown thy foot in secret like a thief [2](sbe46119.htm#an_5:15:5:2), thou hast\nenlightened and freed Atri for the sake of wealth mightily\n[3](sbe46119.htm#an_5:15:5:3).\n\np. 400\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe _Ri_ shi is Dharu _n_ a \xc3\x82\xe1\xb9\x85girasa (cf. dharu _n_ a _h_ vasva _h_ agni _h_ ,\nverse 1; _ri_ tam dharu _n_ am, diva _h_ dharman dharu _n_ e, verse 2; dogham\ndharu _n_ am, verse 5); the metre, Trish _t_ ubh.--No verse of this hymn\noccurs in the other Sa _m_ hitas.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. It may be asked whether _s_ aka, beside its meaning 'the powerful\n(helper),' may also mean 'the power.' This would suit very well, V, 30, 10.\nsam ta\xc2\xb4 _h_ (scil. ga\xc2\xb4 _h_ ) indra _h_ as _ri_ _g_ at asya _s_ akai _h_ ; VI,\n19, 4. tam va _h_ indram _k_ atinam asya _s_ akai _h_ iha nunam va _g_ ayanta\n_h_ huvema. The translation then would be: 'by the power of sacrifice.'\nBohtlingk-Roth conjecture _s_ a\xc2\xb4ke.\n\nNote 2. I believe that sedusha _h_ stands for the nominative, cf. deva\xc2\xb4 _h_\nabibhyusha _h_ , I, 11, 5; S. B. E. XXXII, p. 28. This sedusha _h_ led on to a\nsecond accusative standing for the nominative, n _r i\xc2\xb4_n.--The men sitting on\nthe support of the sky seem to be the forefathers who have established the\nuniversal laws, the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. I consider a _m_ hoyuva _h_ as nom. plur. masc., but it may also be\ngen. sing. masc., or acc. plur. fem., as an epithet either of Agni or of his\ntanv\xcc\x83a _h_.\n\nNote 2. The ancient one (purvya) seems to be Agni (cf. verse i).\n\nNote 3. Cf. VI, 46, 12. yatra _s_ u\xc2\xb4rasa _h_ tanv\xcc\x83a _h_ vitanvate.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. I think, like Ludwig, that _g_ arase should be accented.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. These are accusatives.--Cf. on this passage, Pischel, Vedische\nStudien, I, 39 seq.\n\nNote 2. Cf. H. O., Prolegomena, p. 73.\n\nNote 3. Cf. VI, 1, 2. maha _h_ raye _k_ itayanta _h_.--See Geldner, Ved.\nStudien, I, 268.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 16](sbe46120.htm)\n\n"
