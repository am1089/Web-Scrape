Indra, committing a desecration of the\nsacrifice, by main force drank off his (Tvash _t_ _ri_ \'s) Soma juice. He went\nasunder in every direction,--from his mouth and vital airs his excellence and\nfame passed\n\np. 249\n\naway, and entered the cattle, whence cattle are one\'s fame: and famous,\nindeed, is he who, knowing this, is consecrated 1 by the Sautrama _n_ i.\n\n12:8:3:22\\. The two A _s_ vins and Sarasvati then prepared for him this\nsacrifice, the Sautrama _n_ i, for the purpose of healing him, and thereby\nconsecrated him: thereby he became the highest of gods, and so does he who is\nconsecrated by that (offering) become the highest among his own people.\n\n12:8:3:33\\. He consecrates him on a black antelope skin; for the black\nantelope skin is the sacrifice 2: it is at the sacrifice he thus consecrates\nhim; on the hairy side (of the skin), for the hair is the metres: it is on the\nmetres (or sacred writ) he thus consecrates him.\n\n12:8:3:44\\. On a throne-seat he consecrates him, for imperial dignity is\nseated (established) on a throne-seat: by means of imperial dignity he thus\ncauses him to attain imperial dignity.\n\n12:8:3:55\\. It is made of udumbara wood, for the udumbara (ficus glomerata) is\nstrength: for the sake of strength he thus is consecrated. It is knee-high,\nfor knee-high is this (terrestrial) world, and it is for (the rule of) this\nworld that the Kshatriya is consecrated; and the ruler (kshatra) indeed he\nbecomes who is consecrated by the Sautrama _n_ i: therefore it is knee-high,\nand of unlimited size horizontally (in width and depth),--\n\n12:8:3:66\\. For the throne-seat means royal dignity, and of unlimited\nprosperity is royal dignity. It is covered with plaited reed-work, for reed-\ngrass is meet for sacrifice. Two of its feet stand on the\n\np. 250\n\nnorthern, and two on the southern altar-ground 1, for the northern vedi is\nthis (terrestrial) world, and the southern one the world of the Fathers: he\nthus consecrates him for both worlds.\n\n12:8:3:77\\. Concerning this, Gauriviti _S_ aktya, knowing this, once said,\n\'Like rulers 2, assuredly, we shall be in yonder world!\' Perhaps 3 it was\nRishabha Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ atura, king of the Svikna, who had told him so.\n\n12:8:3:88\\. He places the throne-seat, with (Va _g_. S. XX, 1), \'Thou art the\nwomb of the Kshatra, thou art the navel of the Kshatra!\' for it indeed is the\nwomb and navel of the Kshatra (ruling power).\n\n12:8:3:99\\. He then spreads the black antelope skin thereon, with, \'May it not\ninjure thee! do not\n\np. 251\n\ninjure me!\' for the black antelope skin is the sacrifice: (thus it is spread)\nfor the safety of the sacrifice and his own self.\n\n12:8:3:1010\\. He then mounts it, with a verse to Varu _n_ a (Va _g_. S. XX,\n2), for Varu _n_ a is the king of the gods: by means of his own deity he thus\nconsecrates him 1,--\'He hath sat down, the upholder of the sacred law, Varu\n_n_ a, in the home-steads, for supreme rule, he the wise!\'\n\n12:8:3:1111\\. He then throws down a gold and a silver plate (beneath his feet,\nthe silver one beneath the left foot) with, \'Protect (me) from death!\' (the\ngold one beneath the right foot 2 with,) \'Protect (me) from lightning!\' The\nVira _g_ , doubtless, is the rain, and of this there are these two terrible\nforms, lightning and hail; of these the gold plate is of the form of\nlightning, and the silver one of that of hail: against these two deities he\naffords protection to him, whence he who has performed the Sautrama _n_ i has\nno fear of these two deities, as he also who thus knows this.\n\n12:8:3:1212\\. He consecrates him by sprinkling him with the fat gravy of the\nsacrificial animals, for the gravy of the animals means excellence: with that\nexcellence, the essence of cattle, he thus sprinkles him. But that gravy is\nalso the highest kind of food: with the highest kind of food he thus sprinkles\nhim.\n\n12:8:3:1313\\. There are hoof-cups (of gravy), for on hoofs cattle support\nthemselves: he thus causes him to obtain a support. There are thirty-three\n(such)\n\np. 252\n\ncupfuls, for thirty-three in number are all the deities: by means of all the\ndeities he thus consecrates him. He offers them with _g_ agati verses, for\nanimals are of _g_ agata (movable) nature: by means of the _G_ agati he thus\nsecures cattle for him. With sixteen verses (Va _g_. S. XIX, 80-94) he offers,\nfor animals are of sixteen parts: he thus bestows excellence (or prosperity)\non him part by part.\n\n12:8:3:1414\\. \'With lead the wise, with wool and thread 1 the sages weave the\nweb, the sacrifice: the A _s_ vins, Savit _ri_ , Sarasvati, and Varu _n_ a\nhealed the form of Indra 2.\' Each time he has offered two (cupfuls) together,\nhe pours the residue into a bowl (sata): he thereby establishes the days and\nnights, the half-months, the months, and the seasons in the year, and hence\nthese days and nights, half-months, months, and seasons are established\n(contained) in the year.\n\n12:8:3:1515\\. The bowl is made of reed, for the reed has its birth-place in\nthe waters, and the waters are all the deities: by means of all the deities he\nthus consecrates him.\n\n16\\. A rubbing down (of the Sacrificer) with all manner of sweet-smelling\nsubstances takes place (before sprinkling him with fat), for such a rubbing\ndown with all manner of sweet-smelling substances means supreme fragrance:\nwith fragrance he thus consecrates (anoints) him.\n\n12:8:3:1717\\. He sprinkles him (with the fat gravy) in front while (himself)\nlooking towards the back (west), for\n\np. 253\n\nfrom the front food is visibly eaten. On. every side (he sprinkles him) whilst\nmoving round: he thus bestows food on him from all quarters, whence food is\nsecured from all quarters by him who has performed the Sautrama _n_ i, or even\nby him who thus knows this.\n\n12:8:3:1818\\. With a formula to the A _s_ vins he sprinkles him first 1, then\nwith one to Sarasvati, then with one to Indra: it is by means of these deities\nhe thus consecrates him. Now, some consecrate him by means both of these\ndeities and those utterances, \'bhu _h_ bhuva _h_ , svar,\' \'for,\' say they,\n\'these utterances ("earth, air, heaven") mean all this (universe) it is by\nmeans of all this (universe) we thus consecrate him.\' Let him, however, not do\nso, but let him only consecrate him by means of those deities, for those\ndeities, indeed, are all this (universe).\n\n12:8:3:1919\\. He consecrates him prior to the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t (offering),\nfor the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t is the Kshatra: he thus consecrates him by means\nof the Kshatra (or, by a Kshatriya). And he consecrates him between (the\noblation to) the Lord of the Forest 2 and the\n\np. 254\n\n[paragraph continues] Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t, for the lord of the forest (or the\ntree) is Soma, and the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t (maker of good offering) is Agni:\nhe thus consecrates him after encompassing him by Agni and Soma; whence both\nthose who know, and those who do not, say, \'A Kshatriya is the consecrator of\na Kshatriya 1.\'\n\n12:8:3:2020\\. They then lift him up 2 knee-high, then navel-high, then as high\nas the mouth; for the Va _g_ apeya doubtless is the same as the consecration,\nand the Sautrama _n_ i is a consecration; and even as there, at the Va _g_\napeya, he (the Sacrificer) mounts the sacrificial stake 3, like that is this\nrite.\n\n12:8:3:2121\\. As to this they say, \'But, surely, he who is consecrated by the\nSautrama _n_ i moves away from this world.\' Well, he descends again upon the\nblack antelope skin, and, the black antelope skin being the sacrifice, he thus\nfinally establishes himself on the sacrifice.\n\n12:8:3:2222\\. [He descends 4, with Va _g_. S. XX, 10,] \'Firmly 5 I establish\nmyself in the Kshatra (lordship), in royal sway,\'--in lordship and royal sway\nhe thus establishes himself so as not to lose lordship and royal\nsway;--\'firmly in horses I establish\n\np. 255\n\nmyself, and in kine,\'--in the midst of horses and kine he thus establishes\nhimself so as not to lose horses and kine;--\'firmly in the limbs I establish\nmyself, and in the body,\'--in the limbs and in the body he thus establishes\nhimself so as not to lose his limbs and his body;--\'firmly in the vital airs I\nestablish myself, and in prosperity,\'--in the vital airs and in prosperity he\nthus establishes himself so as not to lose the vital airs and\nprosperity;--\'firmly in heaven and on earth I establish myself, and in the\nsacrifice,\'--he thus establishes himself in these two, heaven and earth,\nwithin which is all this (universe).\n\n12:8:3:2323\\. He 1 then sings a Saman (hymn-tune), for the Saman means\nlordship (kshatra): with lordship he thus consecrates him; or the Saman means\nimperial sway: by means of imperial sway he thus causes him to attain imperial\nsway. And, indeed, the Saman is the essence of all the Vedas: he thus\nconsecrates him with the essence of all the Vedas.\n\n12:8:3:2424\\. He sings it on a b _ri_ hati verse 2, for established on the B\n_ri_ hati, as his excellence and foundation,\n\np. 256\n\nthat sun shines 1: he thus establishes him on the B _ri_ hati, as his\nexcellence and foundation.\n\n12:8:3:2525\\. He sings it on a b _ri_ hati verse relating to Indra, for this\nsacrifice, the Sautrama _n_ i, belongs to Indra, and even now he who\nsacrifices has Indra for his support: he thus consecrates him on his own\nsupport (or resting-place).\n\n12:8:3:2626\\. And as to why (these hymns) are called \'bracers 2;\' it is\nbecause by means of these Samans the gods braced Indra up to energy, or vital\npower: in like manner do the officiating priests, by means of these Samans,\nbrace the Sacrificer up to energy, or vital power. \'Sa _m_ _s_ ravase, vi _s_\nravase, satya _s_ ravase, _s_ ravase 3\'--these are the Samans: they proclaim\n\np. 257\n\nhim in these worlds. There are four _finales_ , for there are four quarters:\nthey thus establish him in all the quarters. All (the priests) join in the\n_finale:_ with one mind they thus bestow excellence upon him.\n\n12:8:3:2727\\. As to this they say, \'Seeing that this Saman is sung, wherein\nthen does the recitation (uktha) of this Saman consist, and what is its\nfoundation; for unsuccessful is what is chanted unless it be followed by a\nrecitation?\'\n\n12:8:3:2828\\. \'Thrice eleven are the gods;\' this, indeed, is the recitation 1\nbelonging to that Saman, this its foundation.\n\n12:8:3:2929\\. Or he (the Adhvaryu) takes a thirty-third cupful (of gravy),\nwith (Va _g_. S. XX, 11-12  1), \'Thrice\n\np. 258\n\neleven are the gods,\'--for there are indeed thrice eleven gods;--\'three-and-\nthirty, bountiful,\'--for there are thirty-three gods; \'with B _ri_ haspati for\ntheir Purohita,\'--B _ri_ haspati is the Brahman (n.): he thus means to say,\n\'With the Brahman for their Purohita (family-priest);\'--\'at the impulse (sava)\nof the god Savit _ri_ ,\'--that is, \'impelled by the god Savit _ri_ ;\'--\'may\nthe gods protect me through the gods!\' for the gods indeed consecrate him\nthrough the gods.\n\n12:8:3:3030\\. \'The first with the second,\'--for the first (gods, on earth)\nconsecrate him along with the second ones (in the air);--\'the second with the\nthird,\'--for the second ones consecrate him along with the third ones (in the\nsky);--\'the third with 1 the truth,\'--for the third ones consecrate him with\nthe truth;--\'the truth with the sacrifice,\'--for the truth consecrates him\nwith the sacrifice;--\'the sacrifice with sacrificial texts,\'--for the\nsacrifice consecrates him with sacrificial texts;--\'sacrificial texts with\nhymn-tunes,\'--for sacrificial texts (ya _g_ us) consecrate him along with\nhymn-tunes \'hymn-tunes with hymn-verses,\'--for hymn-tunes consecrate him along\nwith hymn-verses ( _ri_ _k_ ):--\'hymn-verses with invitatory verses,\'--for\nhymn-verses consecrate him along with invitatory verses;--\'invitatory verses\nwith offering-verses,\'--for invitatory verses consecrate him along with\noffering-verses;--\'offering-verses with Vasha _t_ -calls,\'--for offering-\nverses consecrate him\n\np. 259\n\nalong with Vasha _t_ -calls;--\'Vasha _t_ -calls with oblations,\'--for Vasha\n_t_ -calls consecrate him along with oblations;--\'May the oblations render\nsuccessful my wishes! bhu _h_! svaha!\'--having thus consecrated him by means\nof those deities from first to last, he thus, by means of oblations, renders\nall his wishes successful. Having then solicited an invitation from the\nofficiating priests, he (the Sacrificer) drinks 1 (the remains of the cup of\nvasa), for the officiating priests are the seasons: it is thus in the seasons\nthat he solicits art invitation.\n\n12:8:3:3131\\. He drinks it, with (Va _g_. S. XX, 13), \'My hair is endeavour 2,\nmy skin submission and approach 3, my flesh inclination, my bone wealth, and\nmy marrow submission,\'--for he who is consecrated by the Sautrama _n_ i enters\nthe worlds and among the deities; he now has himself, invited amongst them 4,\nand thus he arises (in the other world) complete, with a whole body, and with\n(all) limbs.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[249:1](sbe44070.htm#fr_630) Literally, sprinkled, i.e. anointed, with the\n\'vasa,\' or fat gravy obtained from the cooking of the sacrificial animals.\n\n[249:2](sbe44070.htm#fr_631) See part i, p. 23, note 2.\n\n[250:1](sbe44070.htm#fr_632) For the two special Vedis, see [p.\n225](sbe44067.htm#page_225), note [1](sbe44067.htm#fn_584).\n\n[250:2](sbe44070.htm#fr_633) \'A kind of Kshatriyas,\' Delbruck, Altind.

Regarding the allusions in this verse,\nsee [XII, 7, 1, 10](sbe44065.htm#12:7:1:10) seqq.; 2, 17; 7, 3, 3.\n\n[253:1](sbe44070.htm#fr_639) According to Katy. _S_ r. XIX, 4, 14-17, he\nsprinkles him up to the mouth, letting it flow down on all four sides; and\nwith each sprinkling he pronounces one of the formulas, first, the Savitra\none, Va _g_. S. XX, 3, \'At the impulse of God Savit _ri_ (I consecrate) thee\nby the arms of the A _s_ vins, and the heads of Pushan!\' followed by the \xc3\x82 _s_\nvina one, \'with the healing medicine of the A _s_ vins I sprinkle thee for\nenergy and holy lustre!\' and the Sarasvata one, \'with the healing medicine of\nSarasvati I sprinkle thee for vigour and food!\' Then a fourth time with a\nformula referring to all the deities (or with the three great utterances), or\nwith the Aindra text, \'With Indra\'s power I sprinkle thee for strength, for\nexcellence, and for fame!\'\n\n[253:2](sbe44070.htm#fr_640) For this oblation, see III, 8, 3, 33; IV, 5, 2,\n11; in both cases it is followed immediately by the oblation to Agni Svish _t_\nak _ri_ t.\n\n[254:1](sbe44070.htm#fr_641) Kshatriyo ra _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ o\xe0\xa4\xbdbhishekta bhavati, purva\n_m_ hi ra _g_ aiva v _ri_ ddha _h_ kumara _m_ _k_ abhishi _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ atity artha\n_h_ ; comm.\n\n[254:2](sbe44070.htm#fr_642) According to Katy. Sr. XIX, 4, 19-2I, the\nAdhvaryu first touches him, with (Va _g_. S. XX, 4), \'Thou art Ka, thou art\nKatama,--to Ka thee!\' and the Sacrificer replies, \'O thou of good fame! O most\npropitious one! O true king!\' and touches his limbs one after another with XX,\n5-9.\n\n[254:3](sbe44070.htm#fr_643) See part iii, p. 32 (V, 2, 1, 9 seqq.).\n\n[254:4](sbe44070.htm#fr_644) That is, when the throne-seat has been lowered\nagain, he rises from it and stands on the deer-skin.\n\n[254:5](sbe44070.htm#fr_645) The function of \'prati\' here seems to be to\nstrengthen the preposition in the verb \'prati-tish _th_ ami.\'\n\n[255:1](sbe44070.htm#fr_646) According to the commentator on Katy. XIX, 5, 1,\nthe Brahman sings, whilst La _t_ y. V, 4, 16-19 gives directions from which\nthe Udgat _ri_ would seem to be expected to perform this duty. When the\nSacrificer is being anointed, the Udgat _ri_ is to step between the (northern\nand southern) fires and, as soon as he is called upon by the Adhvaryu, he is\nto commence the Saman. It would probably depend on the Brahman\'s previous\nstudies, whether or not he was sufficiently conversant with the complicated\ndetails of the hymnology.\n\n[255:2](sbe44070.htm#fr_647) Viz. Va _g_. S. XX, 30 (Riks. VIII, 89, 1), \'To\nIndra, O Maruts, sing ye the great (hymn), most destructive to V _ri_ tra,\nwhereby the promoters of sacred rites produced the light, the wakeful god for\nthe god.\'\n\n[256:1](sbe44070.htm#fr_648) Professor Weber, Ind. Stud. VIII, p. 42, refers\nto a parallel passage in Ta _n_ _d_ ya-Br. VII, 4, 7--\'By means of the\nBahishpavamana (of the morning service) the gods carried off \xc3\x82ditya, the sun,\nto heaven; but he did not stop there. At midday they then fixed him by means\nof the B _ri_ hati, and for this reason the B _ri_ hati metre is used for the\nPavamana-stotra at the midday service.\'\n\n[256:2](sbe44070.htm#fr_649) Literally, sharpeners or sharpenings (sa _m_ _s_\nana).\n\n[256:3](sbe44070.htm#fr_650) These words--apparently meaning \'for fame all\nround, for fame far and wide, for true fame, for fame\' (or, perhaps, for\nhearing, or, rather, being heard of all round,\' &c.)--are used to form the\n_finales_ (nidhana) in which all the priests are to join; cf. Samav., Calc.\ned., I, pp. 533-4, where the figured text is given. According to Katy. XIX, 5,\n4-5; La _t_ y. V, 4, 19, the words, \'sa _m_ _g_ ityai, vi _g_ ityai, satya _g_\nityai, _g_ ityai\' (for complete victory, victory far and wide, &c.), and\n\'sampush _t_ yai, vipush _t_ yai,\' &c. (for complete prosperity, &c.), are to\nbe used instead, in the case of a Kshatriya and Vai _s_ ya respectively,\neither optionally or necessarily. Though these four words are here, and\nelsewhere, spoken of as so many different Samans, only \'the last of them (\'\n_s_ ravase\') forms the _finale_ of a Saman in the ordinary sense of the word;\nthe others being merely combined with certain musical ejaculations, or\nexpletives (stobhas). All the four \'Samans\' begin with the same phrase\n(varying only in the verb)--\'sa _m_ tva hinvanti (ri _n_ anti, p. 257\ntatakshur, _s_ i _s_ anti) dhitibhi _h_ ,\' i, e. \'they make thee up (or urge\nthee on) with prayers,\' serving as a kind of prelude (prastava) the single\nwords of which are given among the Stobhas (Samav\xe2\x80\x9e Calc. ed., II, p. 522, last\nline), as, indeed, the words \'sa _m_ _s_ ravase,\' &c., themselves are (ib., p.\n520). In the first three Samans this phrase is followed by the _finale_\nconsisting of the respective characteristic word preceded by the Stobha\n\'auhova.\' In the last Saman, on the other hand, the introductory phrase is\nfollowed by the choral setting of the verse \'B _ri_ had indraya gayata\' (see\np. 255, n. 2), which, in its turn, is followed again by the first phrase, with\na slightly modified modulation, ending with \'auhova _s_ ravase.\' Whilst\njoining in the _finale_ , the priests, according to La _t_ y. V, 4, 17, are to\nlay their hands on the head of the Sacrificer.\n\n[257:1](sbe44070.htm#fr_652) According to Katy. Sr. XIX, 4, 24; 5, 8 seq.; 7,\n1 seq., the thirty-third libation of gravy is taken with the text, XX, 32, \'yo\nbhutanam adhipati _h_ (he who is the over-lord of creatures),\' &c.; whilst, on\nthe conclusion of the Sastra, or Hot _ri_ \'s recitation, the Sacrificer offers\nthe libation from that last cup with XX, 11-12, and drinks the remainder with\nXX, 13. The Sastra, recited in response to the Saman, consists of the section\nof .eleven verses, Va _g_. S. XX, 80-90, the first and last verses of which\nare recited thrice; whilst the \'ahava\' ( _s_ o _m_ savom, \'let us praise,\nom!\') is inserted by him before each triplet of the remaining nine verses. The\ntwo verses used whilst the Sacrificer offers (XX, 11-12) are likewise recited\nby the p. 258 Hot _ri_ , as a \'nivid,\' being either added at the end of the\nSastra, or inserted before the ninth or tenth verse; the whole recitation thus\nconsisting of seventeen verses.\n\n[258:1](sbe44070.htm#fr_653) Mahidhara takes the instrumental throughout as a\nsociative (saha satyena).\n\n[259:1](sbe44070.htm#fr_654) According to Katy. XIX, 5, 9, the priests\nthemselves first smell the remainder of the fat gravy, with the text (XX, 34),\n\'The protector of my breath thou art,\' &c. Cf. also [XIV, 2, 2,\n42](sbe44122.htm#14:2:2:42), with note.\n\n[259:2](sbe44070.htm#fr_655) The use of \'prayati\' in this sense (here and Va\n_g_. S. XVIII, 1) is peculiar; being apparently derived from \'pra-yam,\' one\nwould expect it to have some such meaning as \'offer, gift.\' This and the other\npredicates, according to Mahidhara, are to show the state of feeling of beings\ntowards the (royal) Sacrificer. The repetition of \'anati\' (bowing,\nprostration, submission) is strange. A strong alliterative cadence is\nnoticeable in the verse.\n\n[259:3](sbe44070.htm#fr_656) ? Hardly \'return\' here; rather, perhaps,\n\'attaining to (the other worlds),\' or, possibly, \'the turning to him,\ngathering round him (of the people).\'\n\n[259:4](sbe44070.htm#fr_657) ? Or, he now calls these to himself in the\nmeantime.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XII, 9, 1. Ninth Adhyaya. First Brahma _n_ a](sbe44071.htm)\n\n'
