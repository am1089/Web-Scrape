(1)\n\nDirect realisation is herein expounded as a means to liberation. It should be\nstudied, again and again, with great effort, only by the wise. (2)\n\nBy following the duties of one\'s own caste and order, by asceticism and by the\npropitiation of Hari, men will gain the four-fold requisite of freedom from\ndesires, etc. (3)\n\np. 40\n\nSpotless freedom from desires means such a dissatisfaction in respect of all\nobjects from Brahman down to the inanimate as is felt in respect of the\nexcrement of a crow. (4)\n\nDiscrimination of the real means the determination that the nature of the self\nis eternal while, all that is perceptible is otherwise (5)\n\nThe constant eradication of mental impressions is called control of mind. The\nrestraint of external activities is called control of body. (6)\n\np. 41\n\nExtreme abstention is the turning away from the objects of enjoyment. The\nendurance of all kinds of pain is called resignation, which is beneficial. (7)\n\nDevoted belief in the sayings of the Veda and of the teacher is called faith.\nThe concentration of the mind on the reality that is the ultimate goal is\ncalled balance. (8)\n\nDesire for liberation is the name given to the intense thought "How and when,\nO Lord, shall liberation from the bonds of _sams ara_ come to me?" (9)\n\nWhosoever desires his own welfare should, after acquiring the above-mentioned\nqualifications,\n\np. 42\n\ncommence the enquiry with a view to the attainment of knowledge. (10)\n\nKnowledge cannot spring up by any other means than enquiry, just as the\nperception of things is impossible without light. (11)\n\n"Who am I? How was this (universe) born? Who is its maker? What is its\nmaterial cause?" This is the kind of enquiry referred to above. (12)\n\n"I am not the body which is a mere conglomeration of the elements, nor am I\nthe group of the senses, but am something different from all these." This is\nthe kind of enquiry referred to above. (13)\n\np. 43\n\n"All this (universe) has its origin in ignorance and is dissolved by\nknowledge. Desire, in its various aspects, is the mainspring of all action."\nThis is the kind of enquiry referred to above. (14)\n\n"The prime cause of both these ( _viz_., ignorance and desire) is the one,\nsubtle and immutable Reality *, even as the clay is the prime cause of the\nearthen vessel etc." This is the kind of enquiry referred to above. (15)\n\n"I too am the one, subtle, and immutable Reality, the knower, the witness. I\nam That, without doubt." This is the kind of enquiry referred to above. (16)\n\np. 44\n\nThe self is without parts and without a second; but the body is comprised of\nmany parts. And yet they identify the two. Can any ignorance be worse than\nthis? (17)\n\nThe self is the ruler and subjective; the body is the ruled and objective. And\nyet they identify the two. Can any ignorance be worse than this? (18)\n\nThe self is of the nature of knowledge and pure; the body consists of flesh\nand is impure. And yet they identify the two. Can any ignorance be worse than\nthis? (19)\n\np. 45\n\nThe self is that which illuminates and is absolutely pure; the body is inert.\n* And yet they identify the two. Can any ignorance be worse than this? (20)\n\nThe self is eternal and real by nature; the body is transient and unreal. And\nyet they identify the two. Can any ignorance be worse than this? (21)\n\nThe resplendence of the self consists in its making all things cognisable. Its\nshining is not like that of fire etc., for, there is darkness at night (in\nspite of their presence in one place). (22)\n\np. 46\n\nHe who thinks "I am the body" remains, alas! in ignorance, as also he who\nthinks "this body is mine", as if he were always looking at an earthen vessel\nbelonging to him. (23)\n\n"I am indeed Brahman, without difference, without change, and of the nature of\nreality, knowledge and bliss. I am not, therefore, the body which is unreal."\nThis is what the wise call knowledge. (24)\n\n"I am without change, without form, without blemish and without decay. I am\nnot, therefore, the body which is unreal." This is what the wise call\nknowledge. (25)\n\n"I am without disease, without appearances, without alternatives, and all-\npervading. I am\n\np. 47\n\nnot, therefore, the body which is unreal." This is what the wise call\nknowledge. (26)\n\n"I am without attribute, without action, eternal, eternally free, and\nimperishable. I am not, therefore, the body which is unreal." This is what the\nwise call knowledge. (27)\n\n"I am stainless, without motion, without end, pure, and devoid of old age and\ndeath. I am not, therefore, the body which is unreal." This is what the wise\ncall knowledge (28)\n\nWhy, fool, dost thou imagine to be an absolute void the self which is\ndifferent from the body but which resides even in your body as the informing\nspirit * auspicious, real, accepted by all? (29)\n\np. 48\n\nFool, learn from the Veda and by reasoning the nature of thy own self which is\nthe informing spirit beyond the body, absolutely real by nature and utterly\nincomprehensible by men like you. (30)\n\nThat which is denoted by the word "I" for ever remains sole and\ntranscendental. That which is gross, on the other hand, undergoes\nmultiplicity. How then can the body be the self? (31)\n\nThe "I" is assuredly the perceiver and the body the perceived, as is evident\nfrom the expression "this body is mine". How then can the body be the self?\n\np. 49\n\nIt is a matter of direct experience that the "I" is devoid of change, whereas\nthe body is undergoing incessant change. How then can the body be the self?\n(33)\n\nThe wise have ascertained the exact nature of the self from the Vedic passage\n"Than whom there is naught higher, etc." * How then can the body be the self?\n(34)\n\nIt is further declared by the Veda in the _Purusha-s ukta_ that all this\nuniverse is verily\n\np. 50\n\nthe self. How then can the body be the self? (35)\n\nFurther, it is declared in the _Brihad arnyaka-upanishad_ that the self is\nincontaminable. How then can the body, contaminated by numberless impurities,\nbe the self? (36)\n\nIn that same _upanishad_ it is declared that the self is indeed self-\nresplendent. How then can the body, inert and requiring to be illuminated by\nanother, be the self? (37)\n\nEven the ritual portion of the Veda declares that the self, distinct from the\nbody and eternal, enjoys the fruits of ritual after the demise of the body.\n(38)\n\np. 51\n\nEven the subtle body *, composed of many parts, Unstable, objective, mutable,\nfinite, and unreal,--how can it be the self? (39)\n\nThe self is thus distinct from both the gross and the subtle bodies. It is the\ninforming Spirit, the Supreme Lord, the soul of all, identical with all,\nbeyond all, the "I", the immutable. (40)\n\n(Says the opponent.) By the above distinction between the self and the body,\nit only follows that the manifested world is real, as declared by the science\nof logic. \xe2\x80\xa0 Your aim therefore fails. (41)\n\np. 52\n\n(This is the answer.) By the above distinction between the self and the body,\nthe identification of the body with the self has alone been refuted. The\nunreality of the body as a separate entity will now be clearly explained. (42)\n\nSince Consciousness is one by nature, no distinction is admissible under any\ncircumstances. Even the condition of the individual soul must be understood to\nbe unreal, like the apprehension of a serpent in a rope. (43)\n\nAs the rope, in consequence of one\'s ignorance of it, appears in an instant as\na serpent,\n\np. 53\n\nso does consciousness, which is ever pure, manifest itself as the universe.\n(44)\n\nThere can be no other material cause of the universe than _Brahman_. All this\nuniverse, therefore, is only _Brahman_ and naught else. (45)\n\nThe distinction of the pervader and the pervaded is unreal by reason of the\ndeclaration "The Self is all." If the highest truth is thus understood, how\ncan there be room for difference? (46)\n\nIndeed, multiplicity is directly contradicted by the Veda. * How can there be\nany manifestation\n\np. 54\n\ndifferent from the one (secondless) cause. (47)\n\nThe Veda has also pointed out the evil consequence, namely, that the man who,\nduped by illusion, perceives [multiplicity](errata.htm#1) in this world,\npasses on from death to death. * (48)\n\nAll creatures are born of Brahman, the Supreme Self. One should therefore\nunderstand. that all these are Brahman itself. (49)\n\nThe Veda has declared that Brahman alone assumes all names, all forms and all\nactivities. (50)\n\np. 55\n\nWhatever is made of gold retains for ever the nature of gold. So, too, all\nthat is born of Brahman is of the nature of Brahman. (51)\n\nThe Veda has declared that the ignorant man who rests content with making the\nslightest distinction between the individual soul and the Supreme Self is\nexposed to danger. (52)\n\nWhere there is duality by virtue of ignorance one sees all things as distinct\nfrom the self. When everything is seen as the self, then there is not even an\natom other than the self. (53)\n\np. 56\n\nFor him who has realised that all beings are the self, there is neither\ndelusion nor misery, since there is no second. (54)\n\nIt has been established in a. passage of the Brihadaranyaka that this self is\nBrahman itself which is everything. (55)\n\nThis world, although it is the object of experience and of phenomenal\ntreatment, is yet unreal like a dream, because it is followed by\ncontradiction. * (56)\n\nA dream becomes unreal in the waking state; nor does the waking state exist in\ndream. Both dream and waking are absent in sleep,\n\np. 57\n\nand sleep too is absent in dream and in waking. (57)\n\nThus all the three states are unreal, being produced by the three\n[qualities](errata.htm#2). * The Eternal is the witness of these three states,\nbeyond the three [qualities](errata.htm#3), the One that is pure\nconsciousness. (58)\n\nJust as one sees not the separate existence of the pot when he knows that it\nis clay, or the illusive existence of silver when he knows that it is mother-\nof-pearl, so too does one see not the condition of the individual soul when he\nknows Brahman. (59)\n\nJust as a pot is only a name of clay, an ear-ring of gold, or the (illusive)\nsilver of\n\np. 58\n\nmother-of-pearl, so too is the individual foul a name of the supreme. (60)\n\nLike the blueness in the sky, like the mirage in the desert and like the\nillusive appearance of a person in a post, so is the universe in Brahman. (61)\n\nLike a ghost in vacant space, like a city of the celestials * and like two\nmoons in the sky, so is the existence of the world in Brahman. (62)\n\nJust as it is water alone that appears as waves and tides, and copper alone as\nvessels, so\n\np. 59\n\ndoes the self alone appear as many universes. (63)\n\nAs the clay alone appears under the name of pot, as the threads appear under\nthe name of cloth, so does Brahman appear under the name of the world. It\n(Brahman) should, therefore, be realised by the elimination of name. (64)\n\nAll phenomenal life is possible for men only by virtue of Brahman, just as the\npot is possible only by virtue of clay. But men do not understand it thus,\nowing to ignorance. (65)\n\np. 60\n\nJust as the relation of effect and cause always subsists between the pot and\nclay, so does the same relation subsist between the world and Brahman. This is\nknown both from the Vedas and by reasoning. (66)\n\nJust as, when the pot is being seen, it is the clay that is seen _ipso facto_\n, so too when the world is being seen, it is only the self-resplendent Brahman\nthat is seen. (67)\n\nThe self always shines as unconditioned for the wise and always as conditioned\nfor the ignorant, just as the rope appears in two ways. * (68)\n\np. 61\n\nJust as the pot consists of clay, so does even the body consist of the self.\nThis distinction between the self and the not-self is therefore unnecessary\nfor the wise. (69)\n\nAs a rope is perceived as a serpent, or the mother-of-pearl as silver, so too\nis the self understood as the body by the utterly ignorant. (70)\n\nAs clay is perceived as a pot, as threads are perceived as a cloth, so too is\nthe self understood as the body by the utterly ignorant. (71)\n\nAs gold is perceived as an ear-ring or water as a wave, so too is the self\nunderstood as the body by the utterly ignorant. (72)\n\np. 62\n\nAs a post is perceived as a thief or the mirage as water, so too is the self\nunderstood as the body by the utterly ignorant. (73)\n\nAs pieces of wood are perceived as a house or as steel is perceived as a\nsword, so too is the self understood as the body by the utterly ignorant. (74)\n\nJust as trees are seen by one as topsy-turvy by reflection in water, so does\none perceive the self as the body by virtue of ignorance. (75)\n\np. 63\n\nFor the person who is going in a boat, everything appears to be in motion, so\ndoes one perceive the self as the body by virtue of ignorance. (76)\n\nJust as some one with a faulty vision sees a white thing as yellow, so does\none perceive the self as the body by virtue of ignorance. (77)\n\nJust as, when the eyes are dizzy, everything appears as wandering, so does one\nperceive the self as the body by virtue of ignorance. (78)\n\nJust as a firebrand, by being revolved, appears to be circular like the sun,\nso does one perceive the self as the body by virtue of ignorance. (79)\n\np. 64\n\nAll things, however big in size, appear very small at a great distance. So\ndoes one perceive the self as the body by virtue of ignorance. (80)\n\nAll things, however small in size, appear big under a magnifying glass. So\ndoes one perceive the self as the body by virtue of ignorance. (81)\n\nA glassy surface appears as water, and a watery surface as glass. So does one\nperceive the self as the body by virtue of ignorance. (82)\n\np. 65\n\nJust as one mistakes charcoal for a gem or a gem for charcoal, so does one\nperceive the self as the body by virtue of ignorance. (83)\n\nWhen the clouds are moving, the moon appears to move. So does one perceive the\nself as the body by virtue of ignorance. (84)\n\nJust as the directions seem to be changed for one who is in a swoon, so does\none perceive the self as the body by virtue of ignorance. (85)\n\nJust as the moon appears to some one as moving in the waters, so does one\nperceive the self as the body by virtue of ignorance. (86)\n\np. 66\n\nThus is the self mistaken for the body owing to ignorance. But when the self\nis realised, this mistake disappears in Brahman. (87)\n\nThe whole world, sentient and non-sentient, is realised to be only the self.\nHow then can the various things and the various bodies be the self, since they\nare unreal? (88)\n\nO thou that art most intelligent! Spend all thy time in realising the self.\nExhausting all the ripe fruits of thy past deeds, thou needest not feel any\nanxiety. (89)\n\nWe shall now refute the statement in the books that, even when the self has\nbeen realised, such fruits of past actions as are ripe for experience * cannot\nbe avoided. (90)\n\np. 67\n\nWhen the knowledge of the reality has sprung up, there can be no fruits of\npast actions to be experienced, owing to the unreality of the body, etc., in\nthe same way as there can he no dream after waking. (91)\n\nAction done in past lives is called _pr arabdha_. But that has no existence at\nall at any time, since past life is itself unreal. (92)\n\nJust as the dream-body is a mere illusion, so is this (physical) body also.\nHow can an illusory thing have life, and how, if there is no life, can there\nbe that (past action)? (93)\n\np. 68\n\nAs clay is the efficient cause of the pot, so is ignorance declared by the\nVedanta to be the efficient cause of the universe. When that ignorance itself\nis destroyed, where then is this universe? (94)\n\nJust as, by delusion, one ignores the rope and perceives the serpent, so does\nhe of deluded intellect perceive the universe without realising the truth.\n(95)\n\nWhen the form of the rope is understood, the appearance of a serpent\ndisappears. So too when the ultimate reality is realised, the universe\nvanishes. (96)\n\nAnd as the body too is part of the universe, how can any past action subsist?\nBut the\n\np. 69\n\n[paragraph continues] Vedas speak of past action in order to help-the\nunderstanding of the ignorant. (97)\n\nIn the passage "his actions are destroyed when the supreme is realised", the\nVeda expressly speaks of actions in the plural, in order to signify the\ndestruction of _pr arabdha_. * (98)\n\nThere is a twofold fault \xe2\x80\xa0 in the obstinate insistence on _pr arabdha_ by the\nignorant. There is also the forsaking of the Vedanta doctrine, since the Veda\ndeclares the possibility of knowledge. (99)\n\np. 70\n\nFor the gaining of the liberation aforesaid, I shall now explain fifteen\nsteps, by the help of all of which one should at all times practice\nmeditation. (100)\n\nWithout constant practice the self that is pure existence and knowledge cannot\nbe realised. Therefore one who desires knowledge and seeks liberation should\nmeditate on Brahman for a long time. (101)\n\nThe control of the senses ( _yama_ ), the control of the intellect ( _niyama_\n), the avoidance of unreality ( _ty aga_), spiritual silence ( _manna_ ),\nplace ( _desa_ ), time ( _k ala_), posture ( _a sana_), the subdual of the\nroot-cause ( _mulabandha_ ), the equipoise of the body ( _deha-s amya_), the\nfirmness of vision ( _drik-sthiti_ ), (102)\n\np. 71\n\nThe control of life-forces ( _pr anayama_), the withdrawal of consciousness (\n_praty ahara_), the holding of consciousness, ( _dh arana_), self-\ncontemplation ( _dhy ana_), and absorption ( _sam adhi_),--these, in order,\nare said to be the steps. (103)\n\nThe control of all the senses by means of the knowledge "all is Brahman" is\ncalled yama and should be practised again and again. (104)\n\nThe incessant flow of thought towards all that relates to the self and the\nsubmergence of all that relates to the not-self is called _niyama_. It imparts\nsupreme bliss and is assiduously practised by the wise. (105)\n\np. 72\n\n_Ty aga_ is the elimination of the phenomenon of the Universe by realising the\nself that is Brahman. _Ty aga_ is venerated even by the great, because it is\nof the nature of instant liberation. (106)\n\nThe wise man should always see himself as that _mauna_  * from which word and\nthought, not reaching it, turn away, but which is attainable by _yogis_. (107)\n\nWho can speak of that from which all words turn away? If the universe is to be\nspoken of, even that is devoid of words. \xe2\x80\xa0 (108)\n\np. 73\n\nThe above may also be termed _mauna_ and is known as _sahaja_ , among the\nenlightened. The _mauna_ relating to speech * has been ordained by the\nteachers of Brahman for the ignorant. (109)\n\nThat in which no individual existence is possible at the beginning or end or\nin the middle, that by which this universe is at all times pervaded,--that is\nknown as the solitary place ( _desa_ ). (110)\n\nThe secondless ( _Brahman_ ) that is infinite bliss is known as _k ala_,\nbecause by it are manifested, in the twinkling of an eye, all creatures from\nthe creator downwards. (111)\n\np. 74\n\nThat [condition] in which Brahman is incessantly contemplated with unmixed\nbliss is known as _a sana_, and not others * which destroy bliss. (112)\n\nThe _siddha- asana_ \xe2\x80\xa0 is the Immutable which is the beginning of all beings\nand the reality behind the universe, that in which the perfected ever repose.\n(113)\n\nThat which is the root of all existence and which has the control of the mind\nfor its root is the _mula-bandha_  \xe2\x80\xa0 which should be adopted at all times,\nbeing fit for the greatest of _yogis_. (114)\n\np. 75\n\nAbsorption in the all-pervading Brahman is known as the equipoise of the\nlimbs. Without such (absorption) there is no equipoise. Mere stiffness of body\nis like that of a withered tree. (115)\n\nConverting one\'s vision into one of knowledge, one should realise the whole\nworld to be Brahman itself. This is the most advantageous vision ( _drishti_ )\nand not that which is directed to the tip of the nose. (116)\n\nOr, the vision should be solely directed to that wherein ceases the\ndistinction of seer, sight and object. It need not be directed to the tip of\nthe nose. (117)\n\np. 76\n\n_Pr anayama_ is the control of all life-forces by realising naught but Brahman\nin all things such as the mind, etc. (118)\n\nThe negation of the universe is the outgoing breath. The thought "I am Brahman\nitself" is called the incoming breath. (119)\n\nThe permanence of that; thought thereafter is the restrained breath. This is\nthe _pr anayama_ for the wise, while the pressing of the nose is only for the\nunknowing, (120)\n\nThe merging of consciousness in Brahman by realising the self in all objects\nis known as _praty ahara_ and should be practiced by all seekers after\nliberation. (121)\n\np. 77\n\n_Dh arana_, in its highest sense, is the holding of consciousness by realising\nBrahman wheresoever the consciousness reaches. (122)\n\nThe condition wherein there is only the uncontradictable thought "I am Brahman\nitself" and there is no external hold, is denoted by the term _dhy ana_ and is\nproductive of the highest bliss. (123)\n\n_Sam adhi_, whose other name is knowledge, is the forgetfulness of all mental\nactivity by first making thought changeless and then identifying the\nconsciousness with Brahman. (124\n\np. 78\n\nOne should earnestly practice this unconventional bliss until it will\nobediently spring up of its own accord in an instant at the will of the\nindividual. (125)\n\nThen does one, independent of all means, become a perfected being and the\ngreatest of _yogis_. But its real nature cannot be reached by one\'s word or\nthought. (126)\n\nWhile _sam adhi_ is being practised, many impediments will perforce assail\none: break of continuity, idleness, desire for worldly pleasure, (127)\n\nSleep, confusion, temptation, infatuation, and a sense of blankness. These and\nmany other obstacles should be got over, step by step, by the seeker after\nBrahman. (128)\n\np. 79\n\nBy the thought of an object, the consciousness becomes objective; by the\nthought of blankness, the consciousness becomes blank; and by the thought of\nfullness (Brahman). it becomes full (Brahman). One should therefore practice\nfullness. (129)\n\nThose that give up this highest and purest Brahmic consciousness live in vain\nand, though human, are like unto beasts. (130)\n\nThey that have realised this consciousness and, having realised it, develop it\nmore and more, are the best of men, fortunate, and venerable in all the three\nworlds. (131)\n\np. 80\n\nThey, in whom this consciousness grows and also fructifies, attain identity\nwith the eternal Brahman, and not those others who merely fight about words.\n(132)\n\nThese, that are clever in their talk of Brahman, but are devoid of this\nconsciousness and are swayed by strong passions, are, indeed, the most\nignorant among men, and they again and again pass through births and deaths.\n(133)\n\nThe former (on the other hand) do not remain for even half a second without\nthe Brahmic consciousness, in the same way as Brahman * and others, Sanaka and\nothers, Suka and others. (134)\n\np. 81\n\nThe nature of the cause passes into the effect, but not the nature of the\neffect into the cause. One should, therefore, by diligent investigation,\nattain the nature of the cause by eliminating the effect. (135)\n\nThen will shine the absolutely real (self) that is beyond the scope of words.\nThis should be understood again and again by the illustration of the earthen\nvessel. * (136)\n\nIn this manner do the understanding ( _vritti_ ) of Brahman and, thereafter,\nthe Brahmic consciousness, (v\xe1\xb9\x9bitti jnana) spring up in the pure-minded. (137)\n\np. 82\n\nOne should first see the cause as distinct from the effect, and should then,\nat all times, realise the cause as inherent in the effect itself. (138)\n\nOne should see the cause in the effect, and should then eliminate the effect.\nThe cause, as such, will vanish (of its own accord). What then remains, that\nthe sage becomes. (139)\n\nFor, one soon becomes that which he contemplates with extreme assiduity and\nabsolute certainty. This should be understood by the illustration of the wasp\nand the worm. * (140)\n\np. 83\n\nThe wise man, at all times, should attentively meditate upon his own self\nwhich, though unseen, is yet the only reality, and, though manifest as the\nexternal universe, is yet of the nature of subjective consciousness. (141)\n\nHaving turned the visible into the invisible, one should realise everything to\nbe Brahman itself. The wise man should then dwell in eternal bliss with his\nmind full of the essence of pure consciousness. (142)\n\nThis is known as the _r aja-yoga_, consisting of the steps mentioned above.\nWith this should be combined the _hatha-yoga_ for those whose passions have\nonly been partially eradicated. (143)\n\np. 84\n\nTo those however whose minds are fully ripe, the above _yoga_ is by itself\nproductive of perfection. It is easily and speedily attainable by all who have\nfaith in the teacher and in the Lord. (144)\n\n\n\n\n\nThus ends Direct Realisation.\n\n_____\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[43:*](wos06.htm#fr_38) Brahman.\n\n[45:*](wos06.htm#fr_39) That which is illuminated.\n\n[47:*](wos06.htm#fr_40) Purusha.\n\n[49:*](wos06.htm#fr_41) "Than whom there is naught else that is higher, naught\nthat is smaller or bigger.
