Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Great Muni! Now I shall tell you the rules of\nBhuta S\xc2\x92uddhi, i.e., the purification of the elements of the body (by\nrespiratory attraction and replacement, etc.). Firstly, think of the Highest\nDeity Ku _nd_ alini (the Serpent Fire) as rising up in the hollow\n\n\n\np. 1075\n\n\n\ncanal Su _s_ umna in the Spinal Cord from the Muladhara (the sacral plexus) to\nthe Brahmarandhra (the aperture supposed to be at the crown of the head).\nNext, the devotee is to meditate on the Mantra \xc2\x93Hamsa\xc2\x94 and consider his\nJivatma (the embodied soul) united with Para Brahma. Then think from leg to\nthe knees in the form of a square Yantra (diagram as furnished with Vajra\nthunderbolt, represented by 63 lines at the four corners); consider this\nsquare as the earth, of a golden colour and represented by the letter \xc2\x93Lam,\xc2\x94\nrepresenting the Seed Mantra of earth. Next from the knee to the navel\nconsider the semi-moon and at its two ends consider that the two Lotuses are\nsituated. Consider this as the circle of water, of white colour, represented\nby the letter \xc2\x93Vam\xc2\x94 the Seed Mantra of water. Then again from the navel to the\nheart consider it as of a triangular form and the Svastik mark at its three\nangles and think it as of fire and represented by the letter \xc2\x93Ram\xc2\x94 its root\nMantra, of red colour. Next from the heart to the centre of the eyebrows,\nconsider as marked with six dots, with the Seed Mantra \xc2\x93Yam\xc2\x94 of a smoke-\ncoloured colour (dark-red) and of a circular appearance and consider it as\nair. Then again from the centre of the eyebrows to the crown of the head\nconsider as \xc3\x82kas\xc2\x92a Ma _nd_ alam (a region of ether) beautiful and clear and\nwith \xc2\x93Ham\xc2\x94 as its vija letter. Thus thinking consider firstly the earthy\nprinciple originated from watery principle, dissolved in water. Then think\nwater as dissolved in fire, its cause; fire dissolved in air, its cause; and\nair dissolved in \xc3\x82kas\xc2\x92a ether, its cause; then consider \xc3\x82kas\xc2\x92a dissolved in\nits cause Ahamkara, egoism; then again Ahamkara dissolved in the Great\nPrinciple (Mahattatva); and Mahattatva again in its cause Prakriti and\nconsider Prakriti again diluted in its cause, the Supreme Self. Then consider\nyour ownself as the Highest Knowledge and only that. Think, then, of the Papa\nPuru _s_ a, the Sinful Man in your body. The size of this Man is that of a\nthumb and it is situated in the left abdomen. The head of him is represented\nby Brahmahatya (murdering a Brahma _n_ ); his area as stealing gold; his heart\nas drinking wine; his loins as going to the wife of his Guru, his legs as\nmixing with people who go to their Guru's wives, and his toes as representing\nother sins and venial offences. The Sinful Man holds axes and shield in his\nhands; he is always angry, with his head bent down and his appearance is very\nhorrible. Inhale air through the left nostril thinking of \xc2\x93Vam\xc2\x94 the Root\nMantra of air and make Kumbhaka, i.e., fill the whole body with that air, and\nhold it inside, purifying the sinful man; then repeating \xc2\x93Ram,\xc2\x94 the seed\nMantra of fire, think the sinful man with his own body burnt down to ashes.\nThen exhale outside through the right nostril those ashes of the Sinful Man.\nNext consider the ashes\n\n\n\np. 1076\n\n\n\ndue to the burning of the Sinful Man, as rolled and turned into a round ball\nwith the nectar seed of the Moon. Think steadily this ball as transformed into\na golden egg by the Seed Mantra \xc2\x93Lam\xc2\x94 of the earth. Repeat then, \xc2\x93Ham\xc2\x94 the\nseed Mantra of \xc3\x82kas\xc2\x92a and think yourself as an ideal being; pure and clear,\nand shape thus your body and the several limbs.\n\n\n\nCreate, then, fresh in an inverse order from the Brahma the elements \xc3\x82kas\xc2\x92a,\nair, fire, water, earth and locate them in their respective positions. Then by\nthe Mantra \xc2\x93Soham\xc2\x94 separate the Jivatma from the Paramatma and locate the\nJivatma in the heart. Think also that the Kundalini has come to the Sacral\nPlexus, after locating the Jivatma, turned into nectar by contact with the\nHighest Self, in the heart. Next meditate on the vital force, the Pra _n_ a\nS\xc2\x92akti, thus located as follows :-- There is a red lotus on a wide boat in a\nvast ocean of a red colour; on this lotus is seated the Pra _n_ a S\xc2\x92akti. She\nhas six hands holding, in due order, the trident, the arrows made of\nsugarcane, noose, goad, five arrows and a skull filled with blood. She is\nthree-eyed. Her high breasts are decorated; the colour of Her body is like the\nRising Sun. May She grant us happiness. Thus meditating on the Pra _n_ a\nS\xc2\x92akti, Who is of the nature of the Highest Self, one ought to apply ashes on\nhis body in order to attain success in all actions. Great merit arises from\nthe application of ashes (besmearing ashes) on the body. I will now dwell on\nthis subject in detail. Listen. This point of holding ashes on to the body is\nparticularly proved in the Vedas and Smritis.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Eighth Chapter in the Eleventh Book on Bhuta S'uddhi\n(purification of elements in the body) in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 9](bk11ch09.htm)\n\n"
