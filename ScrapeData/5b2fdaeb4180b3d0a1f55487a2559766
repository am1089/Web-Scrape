'Maghavat, this body is mortal and always held by death. It is the abode\nof that Self which is\n\np. 141\n\nimmortal and without body 1. When in the body (by thinking this body is I and\nI am this body) the Self is held by pleasure and pain. So long as he is in the\nbody, he cannot get free from pleasure and pain. But when he is free of the\nbody (when he knows himself different from the body), then neither pleasure\nnor pain touches him 2.\n\n2\\. 'The wind is without body, the cloud, lightning, and thunder are without\nbody (without hands, feet, &c.) Now as these, arising from this heavenly ether\n(space), appear in their own form, as soon as they have approached the highest\nlight,\n\n3\\. 'Thus does that serene being, arising from this body, appear in its own\nform, as soon as it has approached the highest light (the knowledge of Self 3)\nHe (in that state) is the highest person (uttama purusha). He moves about\nthere laughing (or eating), playing, and rejoicing (in his mind), be it with\nwomen, carriages, or relatives, never minding that body into which he was born\n4.\n\np. 142\n\n'Like as a horse attached to a cart, so is the spirit 1 (pra _n_ a, pra _g_\n\xc3\xb1atman) attached to this body.\n\n4\\. 'Now where the sight has entered into the void (the open space, the black\npupil of the eye), there is the person of the eye, the eye itself is the\ninstrument of seeing. He who knows, let me smell this, he is the Self, the\nnose is the instrument of smelling. He who knows, let me say this, he is the\nSelf, the tongue is the instrument of saying. He who knows, let me hear this,\nhe is the Self, the ear is the instrument of hearing.\n\n5\\. 'He who knows, let me think this, he is the Self, the mind is his divine\neye 2. He, the Self, seeing these pleasures (which to others are hidden like a\nburied treasure of gold) through his divine eye, i. e. the mind, rejoices.\n\n'The Devas who are in the world of Brahman meditate on that Self (as taught by\nPra _g_ apati to Indra, and by Indra to the Devas). Therefore all worlds\nbelong to them, and all desires. He who knows that Self and understands it,\nobtains all worlds and all desires.' Thus said Pra _g_ apati, yea, thus said\nPra _g_ apati.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[141:1](sbe01172.htm#fr_355) According to some, the body is the result of the\nSelf, the elements of the body, fire, water, and earth springing from the\nSelf, and the Self afterwards entering them.\n\n[141:2](sbe01172.htm#fr_356) Ordinary, worldly pleasure. Comm.\n\n[141:3](sbe01172.htm#fr_357) The simile is not so striking as most of those\nold similes are. The wind is compared with the Self, on account of its being\nfor a time lost in the ether (space), as the Self is in the body, and then\nrising again out of the ether and assuming its own form as wind. The chief\nstress is laid on the highest light, which in the one case is the sun of\nsummer, in the other the light of knowledge.\n\n[141:4](sbe01172.htm#fr_358) These are pleasures which seem hardly compatible\nwith the state of perfect peace which the Self is supposed to have attained.\nThe passage may be interpolated, or put in on purpose to show that the Self\nenjoys such pleasures as an inward spectator only, without identifying himself\nwith either pleasure or pain. He sees them, as he says afterwards, with his\ndivine eye. The Self perceives p. 142 in all things his Self only, nothing\nelse. In his commentary on the Taittirya Upanishad (p. 45) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara refers\nthis passage to Brahman as an effect, not to Brahman as a cause.\n\n[142:1](sbe01172.htm#fr_359) The spirit, the conscious self, is not identical\nwith the body, but only joined to it, like a horse, or driving it, like a\ncharioteer. In other passages the senses are the horses; buddhi, reason, the\ncharioteer; manas, mind, the reins. The spirit is attached to the cart by the\n_k_ etana; cf. \xc3\x82nanda _g_ \xc3\xb1anagiri.\n\n[142:2](sbe01172.htm#fr_360) Because it perceives not only what is present,\nbut also what is past and future.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 13](sbe01173.htm)\n\n"
