If it be said that from the subsequent (chapter it appears that the\nindividual soul is meant), (we point out that what is there referred to is)\nrather (the individual soul in so far) as its true nature has become manifest\n(i. e. as it is non-different from Brahman).\n\nThe doubt whether, 'on account of the reference to the other,' the individual\nsoul might not possibly be meant, has been discarded on the ground of\n'impossibility.' But, like a dead man on whom am _ri_ ta has been sprinkled,\nthat doubt rises again, drawing new strength from the subsequent chapter which\ntreats of Pra _g_ apati. For there he (Pra _g_ apati)\n\np. 184\n\nat the outset declares that the Self, which is free from sin and the like, is\nthat which is to be searched out, that which we must try to understand ( _Kh_.\nUp. VIII, 7, 1); after that he points out that the seer within the eye, i. e.\nthe individual soul, is the Self ('that person that is seen in the eye is the\nSelf,' VIII, 7, 3); refers again and again to the same entity (in the clauses\n'I shall explain him further to you,' VIII, 9, 3; VIII, 10, 4); and (in the\nexplanations fulfilling the given promises) again explains the (nature of the)\nsame individual soul in its different states ('He who moves about happy in\ndreams is the Self,' VIII, 10, 1; 'When a man being asleep, reposing, and at\nperfect rest sees no dreams, that is the Self,' VIII, 11, 1). The clause\nattached to both these explanations (viz. 'That is the immortal, the fearless;\nthat is Brahman') shows, at the same time, the individual soul to be free from\nsin, and the like. After that Pra _g_ apati, having discovered a shortcoming\nin the condition of deep sleep (in consequence of the expostulation of Indra,\n'In that way he does not know himself that he is I, nor does he know these\nbeings,' VIII, 11, 2), enters on a further explanation ('I shall explain him\nfurther to you, and nothing more than this'), begins by blaming the (soul's)\nconnexion with the body, and finally declares the individual soul, when it has\nrisen from the body, to be the highest person. ('Thus does that serene being,\narising from this body, appear in its own form as soon as it has approached\nthe highest light. That is the highest person.')--From this it appears that\nthere is a possibility of the qualities of the highest Lord belonging to the\nindividual soul also, and on that account we maintain that the term, 'the\nsmall ether within it,' refers to the individual soul.\n\nThis position we counter-argue as follows. 'But in so far as its nature has\nbecome manifest.' The particle 'but' (in the Sutra) is meant to set aside the\nview of the purvapakshin, so that the sense of the Sutra is, 'Not even on\naccount of the subsequent chapter a doubt as to the small ether being the\nindividual soul is possible, because there also that which is meant to be\nintimated is the individual soul, in so far only as its (true) nature has\nbecome manifest.' The Sutra uses the expression 'he whose nature has become\nmanifest,'\n\np. 185\n\nwhich qualifies _g_ iva., the individual soul, with reference to its previous\ncondition  1.--The meaning is as follows. Pra _g_ apati speaks at first of the\nseer characterised by the eye ('That person which is within the eye,' &c.);\nshows thereupon, in the passage treating of (the reflection in) the waterpan,\nthat he (viz. the seer) has not his true Self in the body; refers to him\nrepeatedly as the subject to be explained (in the clauses 'I shall explain him\nfurther to you'); and having then spoken of him as subject to the states of\ndreaming and deep sleep, finally explains the individual soul in its real\nnature, i.e. in so far as it is the highest Brahman, not in so far as it is\nindividual soul ('As soon as it has approached the highest light it appears in\nits own form'). The highest light mentioned, in the passage last quoted, as\nwhat is to be approached, is nothing else but the highest Brahman, which is\ndistinguished by such attributes as freeness from sin, and the like. That same\nhighest Brahman constitutes--as we know from passages such as 'that art thou'\n--the real nature of the individual soul, while its second nature, i.e. that\naspect of it which depends on fictitious limiting conditions, is not its real\nnature. For as long as the individual soul does not free itself from Nescience\nin the form of duality--which Nescience may be compared to the mistake of him\nwho in the twilight mistakes a post for a man--and does not rise to the\nknowledge of the Self, whose nature is unchangeable, eternal Cognition--which\nexpresses itself in the form 'I am Brahman'--so long it remains the individual\nsoul. But when, discarding the aggregate of body, sense-organs and mind, it\narrives, by means of Scripture, at the knowledge that it is not itself that\naggregate, that it does not form part of transmigratory existence, but is the\nTrue, the Real, the Self, whose nature is pure intelligence; then\n\np. 186\n\nknowing itself to be of the nature of unchangeable, eternal Cognition, it\nlifts itself above the vain conceit of being one with this body, and itself\nbecomes the Self, whose nature is unchanging, eternal Cognition. As is\ndeclared in such scriptural passages as 'He who knows the highest Brahman\nbecomes even Brahman' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 9). And this is the real nature of the\nindividual soul by means of which it arises from the body and appears in its\nown form.\n\nHere an objection may be raised. How, it is asked, can we speak of the true\nnature (svarupa) of that which is unchanging and eternal, and then say that\n'it appears in its own form (true nature)?' Of gold and similar substances,\nwhose true nature becomes hidden, and whose specific qualities are rendered\nnon-apparent by their contact with some other substance, it may be said that\ntheir true nature is rendered manifest when they are cleaned by the\napplication of some acid substance; so it may be said, likewise, that the\nstars, whose light is during daytime overpowered (by the superior brilliancy\nof the sun), become manifest in their true nature at night when the\noverpowering (sun) has departed. But it is impossible to speak of an analogous\noverpowering of the eternal light of intelligence by whatever agency, since,\nlike ether, it is free from all contact, and since, moreover, such an\nassumption would be contradicted by what we actually observe. For the\n(energies of) seeing, hearing, noticing, cognising constitute the character of\nthe individual soul, and that character is observed to exist in full\nperfection, even in the case of that individual soul which has not yet risen\nbeyond the body. Every individual soul carries on the course of its practical\nexistence by means of the activities of seeing, hearing, cognising; otherwise\nno practical existence at all would be possible. If, on the other hand, that\ncharacter would realise itself in the case of that soul only which has risen\nabove the body, the entire aggregate of practical existence, as it actually\npresents itself prior to the soul's rising, would thereby be contradicted. We\ntherefore ask: Wherein consists that (alleged) rising from the body? Wherein\nconsists that appearing (of the soul) in its own form?\n\nTo this we make the following reply.--Before the rise of\n\np. 187\n\ndiscriminative knowledge the nature of the individual soul, which is (in\nreality) pure light, is non-discriminated as it were from its limiting\nadjuncts consisting of body, senses, mind, sense-objects and feelings, and\nappears as consisting of the energies of seeing and so on. Similarly--to quote\nan analogous case from ordinary experience--the true nature of a pure crystal,\ni.e. its transparency and whiteness, is, before the rise of discriminative\nknowledge (on the part of the observer), non-discriminated as it were from any\nlimiting adjuncts of red or blue colour; while, as soon as through some means\nof true cognition discriminative knowledge has arisen, it is said to have now\naccomplished its true nature, i.e. transparency and whiteness, although in\nreality it had already done so before. Thus the discriminative knowledge,\neffected by _S_ ruti, on the part of the individual soul which previously is\nnon-discriminated as it were from its limiting adjuncts, is (according to the\nscriptural passage under discussion) the soul's rising from the body, and the\nfruit of that discriminative knowledge is its accomplishment in its true\nnature, i.e. the comprehension that its nature is the pure Self. Thus the\nembodiedness and the non-embodiedness of the Self are due merely to\ndiscrimination and non-discrimination, in agreement with the mantra, 'Bodiless\nwithin the bodies,' &c. (Ka. Up. I, 2, 22), and the statement of Sm _ri_ ti as\nto the non-difference between embodiedness and non-embodiedness 'Though\ndwelling in the body, O Kaunteya, it does not act and is not tainted' (Bha.\nGi. XIII, 31). The individual soul is therefore called 'That whose true nature\nis non-manifest' merely on account of the absence of discriminative knowledge,\nand it is called 'That whose nature has become manifest' on account of the\npresence of such knowledge. Manifestation and non-manifestation of its nature\nof a different kind are not possible, since its nature is nothing but its\nnature (i.e. in reality is always the same). Thus the difference between the\nindividual soul and the highest Lord is owing to wrong knowledge only, not to\nany reality, since, like ether, the highest Self is not in real contact with\nanything.\n\nAnd wherefrom is all this to be known?--From the instruction\n\np. 188\n\ngiven by Pra _g_ apati who, after having referred to the _g_ iva ('the person\nthat is seen in the eye,' &c.), continues 'This is the immortal, the fearless,\nthis is Brahman.' If the well-known seer within the eye were different from\nBrahman which is characterised as the immortal and fearless, it would not be\nco-ordinated (as it actually is) with the immortal, the fearless, and Brahman.\nThe reflected Self, on the other hand, is not spoken of as he who is\ncharacterised by the eye (the seer within the eye), for that would render Pra\n_g_ apati obnoxious to the reproach of saying deceitful things.--So also, in\nthe second section, the passage, 'He who moves about happy in dreams,' &c.\ndoes not refer to a being different from the seeing person within the eye\nspoken of in the first chapter, (but treats of the same topic) as appears from\nthe introductory clause, 'I shall explain him further to you.' Moreover  1, a\nperson who is conscious of having seen an elephant in a dream and of no longer\nseeing it when awake discards in the waking state the object which he had seen\n(in his sleep), but recognises himself when awake to be the same person who\nsaw something in the dream.--Thus in the third section also Pra _g_ apati does\nindeed declare the absence of all particular cognition in the state of deep\nsleep, but does not contest the identity of the cognising Self ('In that way\nhe does not know himself that he is I, nor all these beings'). The following\nclause also, 'He is gone to utter annihilation,' is meant to intimate only the\nannihilation of all specific cognition, not the annihilation of the cogniser.\nFor there is no destruction of the knowing of the knower as--according to\nanother scriptural passage (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 30)--that is imperishable.--\nThus, again, in the fourth section the introductory phrase of Pra _g_ apati\nis, 'I shall explain him further to you and nothing different from this;' he\nthereupon refutes the connexion (of the Self) with the body and other limiting\nconditions ('Maghavat, this body is mortal,' &c.), shows the individual soul--\nwhich is there called 'the serene being'--\n\np. 189\n\nin the state when it has reached the nature of Brahman ('It appears in its own\nform'), and thus proves the soul to be non-different from the highest Brahman\nwhose characteristics are immortality and fearlessness.\n\nSome (teachers) however are of opinion that if the highest Self is meant (in\nthe fourth section) it would be inappropriate to understand the words 'This\n(him) I will explain further,' &c., as referring to the individual soul, and\ntherefore suppose that the reference is (not to the individual soul forming\nthe topic of the three preceding sections, but) to the Self possessing the\nqualities of freeness from sin, &c., which Self is pointed out at the\nbeginning of the entire chapter (VII, 1).--Against this interpretation we\nremark that, in the first place, it disregards the direct enunciation of the\npronoun (i.e. the 'this' in 'this I will explain') which rests on something\napproximate (i.e. refers to something mentioned not far off), and, in the\nsecond place, is opposed to the word 'further' (or 'again') met with in the\ntext, since from that interpretation it would follow that what had been\ndiscussed in the preceding sections is not again discussed in the subsequent\nsection. Moreover, if Pra _g_ apati, after having made a promise in the\nclause, 'This I shall explain' (where that clause occurs for the first time),\ndid previously to the fourth section explain a different topic in each\nsection, we should have to conclude that he acted deceitfully.--Hence (our\nopinion about the purport of the whole chapter remains valid, viz. that it\nsets forth how) the unreal aspect of the individual soul as such--which is a\nmere presentation of Nescience, is stained by all the desires and aversions\nattached to agents and enjoyers, and is connected with evils of various kinds\n--is dissolved by true knowledge, and how the soul is thus led over into the\nopposite state, i.e. into its true state in which it is one with the highest\nLord and distinguished by freedom from sin and similar attributes. The whole\nprocess is similar to that by which an imagined snake passes over into a rope\nas soon as the mind of the beholder has freed itself from its erroneous\nimagination.\n\nOthers again, and among them some of ours (asmadiya _s_ _k_ a ke _k_ it), are\nof opinion that the individual soul as such\n\np. 190\n\nis real. To the end of refuting all these speculators who obstruct the way to\nthe complete intuition of the unity of the Self this _s_ ariraka- _s_ astra\nhas been set forth, whose aim it is to show that there is only one highest\nLord ever unchanging, whose substance is cognition  1, and who, by means of\nNescience, manifests himself in various ways, just as a thaumaturg appears in\ndifferent shapes by means of his magical power. Besides that Lord there is no\nother substance of cognition.--If, now, the Sutrakara raises and refutes the\ndoubt whether a certain passage which (in reality) refers to the Lord does\nrefer to the individual soul, as he does in this and the preceding Sutras  2,\nhe does so for the following purpose. To the highest Self which is eternally\npure, intelligent and free, which is never changing, one only, not in contact\nwith anything, devoid of form, the opposite characteristics of the individual\nsoul are erroneously ascribed; just as ignorant men ascribe blue colour to the\ncolourless ether. In order to remove this erroneous opinion by means of Vedic\npassages tending either to prove the unity of the Self or to disprove the\ndoctrine of duality--which passages he strengthens by arguments--he insists on\nthe difference of the highest Self from the individual soul, does however not\nmean to prove thereby that the soul is different from the highest Self, but,\nwhenever speaking of the soul, refers to its distinction (from the Self) as\nforming an item of ordinary thought, due to the power of Nescience. For thus,\nhe thinks, the Vedic injunctions of works which are given with a view to the\nstates of acting and enjoying, natural (to the non-enlightened soul), are not\nstultified.--That, however, the absolute unity of the Self is the real purport\nof the _s_ astra's teaching, the Sutrakara declares, for instance, in I, 1, 30\n3. The refutation of the reproach of\n\np. 191\n\nfutility raised against the injunctions of works has already been set forth by\nus, on the ground of the distinction between such persons as possess full\nknowledge, and such as do not.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[185:1](sbe34088.htm#fr_190) The masculine 'avirbhutasvarupa _h_ ' qualifies\nthe substantive _g_ iva _h_ which has to be supplied.
