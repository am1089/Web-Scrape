The\ngods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from [Pra _g_ apati](errata.htm#14),\nwere contending. The gods drove about on wheels (cars), and the Asuras stayed\nat home. The gods, while driving about on wheels, saw 1 this rite (sacrificial\nperformance), for it was indeed in driving about on wheels that they saw this\nrite: hence it is to the cart that the formulas relate at the (performance\nwith) sacrificial cakes 2, and to the cart in the building of the fire-altar\n3.\n\n6:8:1:22\\. Now he who drives Agni about goes to the gods by the sacred\nperformance, for divine is the rite performed by him; but he who does not\ndrive him about goes to the Asuras by the sacred performance, for demoniac is\nthe rite performed by him.\n\n6:8:1:33\\. Here now some say, 'It is by himself that he (Agni) is driven\nabout; for by the Vish _n_ u-strides he drives forward, and by the Vatsapra he\nunyokes.' Let him not think this to be so; for divine (to the gods) is that\nprogress of his, to wit, the Vish _n_ u-strides; and divine the unyoking, to\nwit, the Vatsapra. But human would be that progress of his, which he makes in\nthis manner, and human the unyoking he makes.\n\np. 290\n\n6:8:1:44\\. This Agni is Pra _g_ apati; and Pra _g_ apati is both the gods and\nmen. Now when the Vish _n_ u-strides and the Vatsapra are (performed), he\nthereby makes up that form of his which is divine; and when he drives him\nabout he thereby makes up that form of his which is human. Verily, then, he\nwho, knowing this, drives him about, makes up that whole and entire Pra _g_\napati: let him therefore by all means drive him (Agni) about.\n\n6:8:1:55\\. Now on any day on which he may intend to drive, he gets the chariot\nplaced north of the fire (with the pole) to the east; and puts a kindling-\nstick on it (the fire); for at that time the gods first regaled him (Agni)\nwith food, with that kindling-stick, when he was about to start: and in like\nmanner does this one now first regale him with food, with that kindling-stick,\nwhen he is about to start.\n\n6:8:1:66\\. [Va _g_. S. XII, 30; _Ri_ k S. VIII, 44, 1] 'With fuel serve ye\nAgni!'--that is, 'with fuel worship ye Agni!'--'with draughts of ghee awake ye\nthe guest, offer ye libations unto him!'--that is, 'with (draughts of) ghee do\nye awake the guest, and offer libations unto him!'--with a (verse) containing\n(the verb) 'awake' he awakens him for the starting.\n\n6:8:1:77\\. He then lifts him (the fire) up, with (Va _g_. S. XII, 31),\n'Upwards may the All-gods bear thee, O Agni, by their thoughts!'--at the\nbeginning all the gods did indeed bear him upwards by their thoughts, for that\n(or, he) was then their thought: in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now\nbear him upwards by his thoughts, for this now is his thought;--'be thou\ngracious unto us, of fair look, and rich splendour!'--as the text, so its\nmeaning. From the south he places him (Agni) northwards\n\np. 291\n\non (the chariot)--the significance of this has been explained. Having put the\nGarhapatya into a pot, he places it on (the chariot) behind (the \xc3\x82havaniya, or\nUkhya Agni). If he choose, he himself may mount up beside him (Agni), or he\nmay walk by the side (of the chariot).\n\n6:8:1:88\\. He then yokes two oxen, first the right one, then the left one: so\n(it is done) with the gods, otherwise in human (practice). And in whatever\ndirection he may intend to drive, let him first drive east, for the east is\nAgni's region: he (Agni) thus proceeds towards his own region.\n\n6:8:1:99\\. [Whilst driving thither, he mutters, Va _g_. S. XII, 32] 'Go forth,\nO Agni, brilliant thou with propitious flames!'--that is, 'Brilliant, O Agni,\ngo thou forth with propitious, shining flames!'--'Beaming with great beams\ninjure not my people with thy body!'--that is, 'With great shining flames do\nnot injure my people by thyself!'\n\n6:8:1:1010\\. Whenever the axle creaks, let him mutter that prayer (Va _g_. S.\nXII, 33); for demoniacal is that voice which is in the axle: he thereby\nappeases that (voice) and makes it as of the gods.\n\n6:8:1:1111\\. And, again, why he mutters that prayer;--with whomsoever, mounted\n(on a chariot), the axle creaks, this is his own voice: hence when the axle\ncreaks while Agni is mounted, this is the voice of Agni himself. It was Agni\nindeed whom the gods thereby praised and magnified; and in like manner does\nthis (Sacrificer) thereby praise and magnify him: 'Agni roared like the\nthundering sky,'--the meaning of this has been explained 1.\n\np. 292\n\n6:8:1:1212\\. If he unyokes before (reaching) his dwelling, let the fire remain\non the chariot itself; but when he unyokes for (staying at) his dwelling, he\nstops the chariot (with the pole) to the east; and north of it he raises and\nsprinkles (a place) where he takes it (the fire) down. He takes it down from\nsouth to north: the meaning of this has been explained.\n\n6:8:1:1313\\. He then puts a kindling-stick thereon; for on that occasion the\ngods regaled him (Agni) with food, with that kindling-stick, after he had\ntravelled: in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now regale him, after he has\ntravelled, with food, with that kindling-stick.\n\n6:8:1:1414\\. [He puts it on, with Va _g_. S. XII, 34; _Ri_ k S. VII, 8, 4]\n'Far, far famed is this Agni of the Bharata (tribe),'--the Bharata 1,\ndoubtless, is Pra _g_ apati, for he sustains (bhar) this entire\n(universe);--'that his great light shineth brightly, as the sun,'--that is,\n'that, like the sun, his great light shines brightly;'--'he who overthrew Puru\nin battles,'--Puru, by name, was an \xc3\x82sura-Rakshas: him Agni overthrew (abhi-\nstha) in battles;--'blazed up hath the divine guest, gracious unto us;'--that\nis, 'being kindled, the divine guest is gracious to us.' With a (verse)\ncontaining (the verb) 'stha' (he performs), for he thereby makes him stop\n(stha) for (staying at) his home.\n\n6:8:1:1515\\. Now, then, the (symbolic) correspondence,--with the first\n(formula) he puts on a kindling-stick, with one he lifts him up, with one he\nstarts, with one he addresses the axle, with the fifth he puts on a\n\np. 293\n\nkindling-stick, that makes five,--of five layers consists the fire-altar, five\nseasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is\nhis measure, so great does this become.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[289:1](sbe4153.htm#fr_545) Saya _n_ a says, 'virasiddhe _h_ ,' 'by the\nheroes' success.'\n\n[289:2](sbe4153.htm#fr_546) See I, 1, 2, 5.\n\n[289:3](sbe4153.htm#fr_547) Saya _n_ a refers to Va _g_.
