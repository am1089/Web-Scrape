(For  ![](img/00800.jpg) I have substituted  ![](img/00801.jpg) the\nname given by Jangams to all persons and things that are not consecrated to\nthe Jangam creed.)\n\n4\n\nHe that will become a sage, and with pure faith learn these thousand verses\nwithout quitting them surely the place of beatitude is put into the palm of\nhis hand.\n\n5\n\nThat wise man who will even learn only the number of hundred verses, his\nappetites shall be at an end--and he by the four paths shall verily attain the\nabode of the Deity.\n\n6\n\nKnow that the mind is the universal cause. By viewing and meditating on this,\na man shall himself become spirit wherever he dwelleth all his days--know well\nthe truth of this Vema!\n\np. 9\n\n7\n\nIs it in the hand of any one to attain beatitude except that perfected saint\nwho has himself become a portion of the universe? Though those roam the whole\nearth, the caverns, the mountains or the waters of the great deep?\n\n8\n\nThe learned Brahmins who read all that is to be read, cannot yet attain heaven\nand the chief God. If you remain still without moving thy lips, this shall\nthee within thy mind, the glory of the perfected saint.\n\n9\n\nPerfect that the prime root is the first of beings whom it is out of our power\nto make known. If with our secret soul and the thought of our mind we meditate\nupon this perfect, then in the end of thine shall our whole living spirits\nattain beatitude. Therefore will Vemana even in his songs sings the preaches\nof this blessed power whose form he beholdeth in the chamber of his heart.\n\np. 10\n\n10\n\nThese worlds are all like leaves veiling the branch which is hidden from the\nview even of Brahma. He alone who can perceive the branch can sing its\npraises.\n\n11\n\nThough called yet remain silent; Though even again called yet maintain\nsilence, whatever they think, or any one say, let the wise smile as though it\nwas not intended for them; let them meditate in their souls on the supreme,\nhereby becoming themselves Eternal. The hermit that thus persistingly learneth\nshall like Vemana for ever attain the form of God.\n\n12\n\nOne man became diseased, one became a donor every where, another became a\npossessor--such a man became a true saint. One himself became a libertine. But\nnowhere shall we see a mighty sage like to thee O Vemana--truly all these\nvarious forms pertain to thee O brother.\n\n13\n\nAgreeably to the character of an ascetic relinquish all the objects of\ncarnality (or passion). Touch not carnal objects after the manner of a\nmagnanimous sage on earth, consider them the offspring of carnality. Vema hath\nlearned, to subdue all carnality.\n\np. 11\n\n14\n\nVemana openeth not his mouth to say no to anyone's assertion. Thus he seems\nlike to a mad man. He can explain every mystery of that Vedantam which\ndestroys all distinctions and differences. From this knowledge his apathy\narises.\n\n15\n\nThe worshipful teacher who by the due performances of worship hath attained\nmerit. He by that worship shall see (i.e., obtain). Never shall he be changed.\n\n16\n\nBy freely bestowing gifts you on one hand attain heaven but if you trust to\nyour own mind delusion enters. Trust to the light of wisdom to destroy all\nthat is inimical.\n\n17\n\nHe [whom](errata.htm#9) in this world knows wisdom to him, there was no next\nworld (he is as if in heaven). He shall not lose his soul even in the death of\nBrahma, In that he shall be absorbed in the divine mind.\n\np. 12\n\n18\n\nIs he whom you call God in another land? With _Devee_ (the Goddess) he is in\nthe body. Mounting his vehicles (the senses), he rapidly drives his chariots.\n\n19\n\nUntil you find the thing you have lost, you require a light--only so long--\nafter finding it why keep the light? After becoming God why retain the body.\n\n20\n\nIf thou fall at the feet of the teacher will the dog of passion seize ye thee?\nIf you leave the teacher's feet, those dogs will seize thee. Indeed the dog's\ndisposition does not attach to the teacher.\n\n21\n\nBy knowledge of the great spirit he himself became all things. By the\nknowledge of life he became living. Let us first attain the destruction of\nlove and opinion?\n\np. 13\n\n22\n\nWhy should ye in so many ways take care of (afford nourishment) this body?\nWill it not perish (go)? If knowing futurity ye purge away your impurities\nputting an end to destructions ye shall attain beatitude.\n\n28\n\nThe cat having caught a muskrat delights not in it; but pursues the fowl to\nseize it. Without relinquishing the delights ([possession](errata.htm#10))\nwill love cease?\n\n24\n\nThe only god is Eternal; to him who knows that all things curiously compounded\nare in truth the unity and afflictions are as a lie and to him beatitude is\neasy of attainment.\n\n25\n\nAgain by perfection ghee is produced from curds, fire in trees, fragrance from\nfine flowers and oil in seeds; thus shineth forth god the soul of intellect.\n\np. 14\n\n26\n\nBy friction and friction fire is produced in a tree. By continual agitation\nghee is produced in curd. Thus by perpetual meditation shall divine wisdom be\nproduced in our body.\n\n27\n\nUntil he explores his own soul, a man acts (or roams) in ignorance of God (or\nillusion caused by God). If by meditation you comprehend that God is a spirit\nby understanding the beatitude shall be clearly manifested to thee O Vemana.\n\n28\n\nThis ignorant soul (living creature) after living so long imagines that to die\nand be reproduced is the course of nature. To know that heaven where we shall\nbe so far advanced as to forget instruction this is spirituality.\n([Brahman](errata.htm#11))\n\n29\n\nFire can even exist in a tree. But a tree has no power to remain where fire\nis. Like to fire in a tree, is the worldly state, It contains hidden the seeds\nof flame,\n\np. 15\n\n30\n\nIf a cloud intervenes in a way destroys the sun. if your inclinations\nintervene they destroy your firmness. If forgetfulness takes place it destroys\nbeatitude itself\n\n31\n\nConsider the soul in its fourth state (the _turyavastha_ or death); view it\nminute as a mote (cucumber-prickle). Hereby cut off all attachment to earthly\ndesires. He who comprehendeth the essence (or savour) of wisdom, go to, he is\nDivinity.\n\n32\n\nThough he searches, he cannot see the teacher of wisdom (vedanta). There is\nnone in the world who can discover truth, even he be found he will not look to\nany other object.\n\n83\n\nHe that cloth not wallow in nor seek the enjoyments of sensual objects, who\n(in the earth) sees the path of obtaining those objects who yet calls all\nthose deceptive pleasures which proceed from sensual objects sensuality, they\nare the wise. They enjoy this world declaring they enjoy it not.\n\np. 16\n\n34\n\nThe great teacher is concealed in the word. The teacher is the Essence of the\nword. The teacher is hidden in darkness. The teacher is the support of all.\n\n35\n\nAction and inaction are the same to him who sports with his acts and to him\nwho is mighty in _tatwa_. If thou understand it from a determination of what\nis right ( _dharmam_ ) and what the contrary and with pure mind truly set it\nforth.\n\n36\n\nThey who are not able to free them from the trio of attachment (to sons, wife\nand wealth) shall remain plunged in the multitude of desires. How shall they\nattain the bliss of beatitude?\n\n37\n\nThe senseless body (lit. animal) continueth for a while dies, and is\nreproduced in the course of nature. So know that mansion of absorption where\nthou shall forget knowledge. This is Divinity.\n\np. 17\n\n38\n\nIt is the favour of the excellent teacher and through much study that is\nillumed with knowledge and (good conduct) ethics, that shall put thee into\nright path. Teach men that the excellent teacher is himself a part of the\n[Divinity](errata.htm#12).\n\n39\n\nIf thou have not lost shame thou shall not attain the delight of god; unless\nthou humble and incline thyself shame will not leave thee. He who hath given\nall shame shall live a lengthened age (i.e., a man to be perfect must be\nindependent of opinions).\n\n40\n\nSurely thy mother is thy wife and thy wife thy mother. Wise is he who has\ncomprehended this regarding these two (incomplete).\n\n41\n\nUnless thou give up thy lusts thou shall not be released from thy ties. (lit.\ncord: earthly ties). Unless thou be free thou at no devotee. None but a\ndevotee can be freed from all desires.\n\np. 18\n\n42\n\nIf you listen and listen to the voice within thy soul, the first saint shall\nnot be entangled in desires. If thou attain light In the soul, this beatitude,\n\n43\n\nConvert thy mind into a fair chamber built in a summer mansion (pleasure\nhouse) with a bath, well and garden. Prepare it for meeting the maid of wisdom\nin secret and enjoying her charms. Thus let thy hours sweetly glide away.\n\n44\n\nIf thou search in the place where a thing is, thou shalt find it. Why search\nin a place where it is not? Without the conjuration of deep thought thou canst\nnot attain that thing that is above all desirable.\n\n45\n\nHow did he learn all the truth, and yet fail of becoming the Eternal;\ncarefully ascertaining the mystic word in abstraction, they distribute\ninstruction regarding the wondrous from. (loose version).\n\n46\n\np. 19\n\nIn the flame of fire when thou hast firmly immolated (as a holocaust) all\npersonal affection fixing thy thought on the unborn, this shall he an\nacceptable dedication to Hari.\n\n47\n\nThough fire is produced in a tree, is the tree conscious of that fire? Like as\nthe fire is concealed in the tree, thus can no one perceive the nature of the\ndevotee who hath dispelled those passions that harass the soul.\n\n48\n\nTo gaze and gaze on the firmament in the mundane egg shall be excellently\nsweet to the sage if he fully meditates on it: abundantly blessed shall he be\nin whatever direction he directs his view or his steps.\n\n49\n\nHow can he be a (Brahmin) Divine who knoweth not (Brahma) the Divinity in the\ncity of the Divine egg or universe? To understand by own mind, go to, this is\n(Brahminity) Divinity.\n\n50\n\np. 20\n\nThe science taught by a teacher is known to the teacher. The teacher knoweth\nwhat the teacher explaineth. The power of the teacher is known to the primal\nteacher.\n\n51\n\nUnderstanding well in thy mind uniting thyself with thy mind and seizing him\nwho is in thy mind--he that can stay his mind, this is the _yogee_ who knows\nthe great secret.\n\n52\n\nIgnorant that he is himself the truth ( _tatwa_ ) he loves delusion which he\nimagines to be truth. If truly he sought for uprightness and virtue ( _dharma\nand carma_ ) this should be, to him, the truth, that is the source of\nhappiness,\n\n53\n\nHe who constantly, without intermission, holdeth the all pervading Divinity in\n(the place of) his soul, he shall arrive at the ineffable dwelling, he shall\ntruly comprehend the world--this is the truth.\n\n54\n\nQuitting this thick darkness of ignorance he who in due time forgetteth\nhimself, and who fixeth his mind with care on the supreme, this great noble\nsage no where is to be found.\n\np. 21\n\n55\n\nAs when one sees a rope and mistakes it for a snake he is alarmed, but when he\nknows it is a rope his fear is over. Thus only when fear departs, can we know\nthe true nature of god.\n\n56\n\nThe Divinity appears diversely to all those who look him. They who seeing see\nand see him with understanding shall behold him; they themselves shall become\nthat vision and that vision, them.\n\n57\n\nHe who comprehends the creed of the spine ( _cundali_ ) what hath that sage of\nmight to do with the embraces of a girl --nobly in this body shall the maid of\nbeatitude alone shine.\n\n58\n\nThe Veda taught by Vemana is known to him alone. Hear! Others know it not. To\nthose who understand Vemana shall the one letter (Om) be a thousand times\ntaught and permanently impressed on their mind.\n\np. 22\n\n59\n\nThe corporal form being burnt in the flame of wisdom the body is all vexed\ncrushing all that desire, that (rolls about or) is afflicted in the body. If\nthus we behold God, this is beatitude, O Vema!\n\n60\n\nHe is like to a meditator, like a dumb man, like to an enjoyer, like a\ndiseased one. He who knows every state shall become Omniscient and be like the\nprince of _yogees_.\n\n61\n\nIs not there one man living of good position? He may live some days in\ncomfort. After living, living and living he lives no longer. If he will know\nthe path to happiness, let him seize that stout thief, his mind cut into\npieces and prepare a dwelling for himself in heaven.\n\n62\n\nWhat is the wisdom of that man who in the house of the body cannot distinguish\nhis friends and foes? On him who knoweth them shall Divine ambrosia be\nbestowed.\n\np. 28\n\n63\n\nLike as water flows in its channel thus does an immersion in that knowledge of\ntruth that arises in the mind ultimately (through an absorption in the final\nessence) constitute the perfect saint. Then is he like to the Ganges when her\nstreams reach the ocean. (a [correct](errata.htm#13) version of awful\nintricacy).\n\n64\n\nCasting away the mind and turning it back knowing the secret of the heart and\nif thou fix thy mind, this is the greatest task of religion.\n\n65\n\nWhile pride of the body remains, love and the lust plunge us in the ocean of\nreproduction. Therefore, desire, mental enemies, senses, thoughts, deceit and\nfraud are all like to dream let us awake O Vema!\n\n66\n\nIf you comprehend not the entire secret and if thy mind be not bound up to one\naim, the Divine secret shall not be revealed to thee. Should it be shewn\nopenly it would be but as the unveiling of the secret parts.\n\np. 24\n\n67\n\nIf we look into these our bodies let us with inner vision consider that the\nnature our forms possess is also that of all other bodies--with devotion do\nall penitents, behold this.\n\n68\n\nIf the teacher knows not in his character, the prime teacher, he is himself as\nblind. The teacher who teaches the teacher is the lord of life.\n\n69\n\nIf first thy intellect steadfastly attached to thy resolution, it shall\ndissipate this blind sleep. If this sleep be dissipated, it shall cause thee\nto attain fearlessness. By tranquillity thou shalt gain the assemblage of all\nfelicity. By that felicity thou shall become the whole world. By being united\nto the universe thou shalt become divine essence. By subduing thy senses, the\nessence (permanent life) shall remain stable in thee. If thou thus fix the\ndivine essence, thou shalt become it. By becoming the lord of the kings of\nsaints thou shalt shine brilliantly; thou shalt walk in delight and with\ndeliracy like an infant, like to an aged man, like a spirit (nocturnal\napparition) like a mad man shalt thou be. Behold thus, shalt thou act in thy\ndignity.\n\np. 26\n\n70\n\nWhatever there be of knowledge and ignorance in the mind, we can neither\nperceive, see nor hear it. If we attempt to take hold on the mind to seize and\nbind it we shall see that the body is replete with delusion and nothing but\ndelusion.\n\n71\n\nThough we know delusion to the death we cannot quit it in the courts of God.\nThey cannot see his equals and co-equals. Were all mighty would there be a\ndistinguished place for God?\n\n72\n\nAll this life is illusion; possession and connections are delusion;\nunderstanding is delusion. I myself on consideration, am delusion. He that\nunderstands this illusion is the sage that comprehends the great secret.\n\n73\n\nThey know not the secret that this is all a world of delusion. They are\nentangled in delusion and deluded. If you only understand this delusion you\nshall attain the celestial regeneration.\n\n74\n\np. 26\n\nWives and sons are delusion; connections are delusion; wealth and greatness\nare delusion; the body is delusion, he that is aware of this delusion is the\nsage who knows all secrets.\n\n75\n\nBorn in delusion, grown in delusion to what end is a man who cannot discern\nthe nature of delusion. He who can under-stand this delusion is the only happy\nman in the world.\n\n76\n\nFor the sake of delusive worldly state, a man being ensnared in it wanders in\ndelusion, After he understands this delusion through delusion itself he\nattains beatitude; that is, his sins, by his quitting them, become sources of\nfelicity.\n\n77\n\nAs long as we are held in the present delusion, the abode of the true state\n(of perfection) is beyond our reach. Then let us become perfected in\naccomplished essence.\n\n78\n\nWhen we see our true figure shall we see truly that our body is born of\ndelusion. He alone who beholdeth within himself the possession of the truth,\nthis is the _parama yogi_.\n\np. 27\n\n79\n\nThe delusion of delusion is the great _maya_ ; the _maya_ that hath not\nsuffered delusion is unknown; it exists not. The _maya_ that is not delusion\nis truth.\n\n80\n\n(Mystic) If through pleasure, and the favour of the teacher, if thou quit this\nhouse with nine doors, thou shalt become the universal spirit and the\nuniverse.\n\n81\n\nStrife ceases when anger ceases; when strife ceases wishes also cease. The\nconnections that lead to future transmigrations cease when distinctions are\ndone away and when the three qualities of virtue, passion and ignorance are\ndissolved, beatitude is permanent, O Vema.\n\n82\n\nHe that knows not the mystical syllable, Om, never can become a saint. He that\nknows not the glory of god is no _yogee_. He that knows not the everlasting is\nnot in a state of beatitude.\n\n83\n\np. 28\n\nBy conquering the senses he that is steady knows the essence of god. How\nshould a man not knowing himself will call such a man a sage?\n\n84\n\nHe who daily and highly considers and forgets from his mind the distinctions\nof I and thou and he that thus liveth is the noble ascetic.\n\n85\n\nSearch and view thyself; thou art the living being. Behold the great ( _tatwa_\n) existent and thou shalt become the spirit. Earth and Heaven shall depart and\ndelusion herself be destroyed.\n\n86\n\nHe who knowing all the powers of Him who dwelleth in the dwelling shall seize\nhis evil mind and seat it. He who can retain his body is the greatest of\ndevotees.\n\n87\n\nIf thou apply thy heel and hold it firmly to thy anus and then seek for thy\ninterior so as to understand the entrance of power, then if thou also cause a\nchange in thy mind (give thy word) and determine on attaining felicity and it\nbecomes the perfection. This is the path of perfection (or _yoga_ ).\n\np. 29\n\n88\n\nBy aid of the observances the mind is stayed. By wrath it is dissipated. The\nsteadfast mind obtains fearlessness. Resolution puts an end to alliance. The\nmind that is removed from alliance suffers us to attain tranquillity. From\ntranquillity is equality he himself becomes the entire world. If he be\ntransmuted into the universe, he is Essence ( _tatwa_ ). That Essence will\nwatch its opportunity and vanquish all the senses. If he becomes thus skilled\nin _tatwa_ he shall become it himself. He shall thus be a _raja yogi_ in\nlustre and shine in the world.\n\n89\n\nWords are a pack of evils; to keep a matter secret is a virtue; avarice is\nlike to death, loan a misfortune, an oath is an evil, words are arrows--all\nthis is not in the least known to men.\n\n90\n\nWhy does this body a bag with nine holes in it, require convenient things and\na high caste, tell me. Believe not that it is thine. Understand and say I am\nBrahma,\n\np. 80\n\n91\n\nAll men are intoxicated and entangled in the six inimical causes of evil\npropensities. Imagining this to be the path of prudence they walk in it; but\nthey cannot view and perceive the truth of god.\n\n92\n\nBurning the tree of earthly ties, the wise man engaging himself in wisdom\nproceeds with propriety. The tree thus burnt will be very delightful.\n\n93\n\nSeeing that connections keep the world in darkness, connections yet form a tie\nbetween man and his creator. If all these connections were dissolved, then in\nthe true path should man see [beatitude](errata.htm#14). (Loose version)\n\n94\n\nThe eye is first fixed on the path of instructions. In the midst, when we have\nlearned somewhat the view dwelleth on our own mind, and at the last the vision\nresteth on him who is pure light.\n\np. 31\n\n95\n\nWhenever you behold him he is looking at nothing else; he fixes his eyes with\nquivering lids upon beatitude night and day in one fixed manner, shall he ever\nlearn to bow to Yama who visiteth the sins of men? What more need we say the\nwhole way of beatitude shall be attained by Vemana.\n\n96\n\nUnless thou relinquish vain words, the formula (of prayer and worship) cannot\nbe learnt; unless thou relinquish the form of prayer and become absorbed in\nmeditation the mind cannot be restrained. Unless thou restrain thy mind thou\nshalt not attain beatitude.\n\n97\n\nIn this filled vessel of the body with which light and darkness agree well, if\nwe forget the sleep of meditation, however great we be we cannot know the\nfirst thing.\n\n98\n\nHe that will strive and bind all the designs, or think not on anything in his\nmind, but be like as a picture, this is the truly great man, whether he be in\nforest or town,\n\np. 32\n\n99\n\nHe who will remain in contemplation with quivering eyelids and fail not to fix\nthe Being in his mind, but perpetually view him--easy is not anywhere for\nbeatitude to be duly placed in him.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 100-199](vov03.htm)\n\n"
