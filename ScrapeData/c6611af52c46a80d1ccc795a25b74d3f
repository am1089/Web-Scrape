The son took the\nmoney and departed. He had not gone far before he came across some herdsmen\nquarrelling over a dog, that some of them wished to kill. "Please do not kill\nthe dog," pleaded the young and tender-hearted fellow; "I will give you one\nhundred rupees for it." Then and there, of course, the bargain was concluded,\nand the foolish fellow took the dog, and continued his journey. He next met\nwith some people fighting about a cat. Some of them wanted to kill it, but\nothers not. "Oh! please do not kill it," said he; "I will give you one hundred\nrupees for it." Of course they at once gave him the cat and took the money. He\nwent on till he reached a village, where some folk were quarrelling over a\nsnake that had just been caught. Some of them wished to kill it, but others\ndid not. "Please do not kill the snake," said he; "I will give you one hundred\nrupees." Of course the people agreed, and were highly delighted.\n\nWhat a fool the fellow was! What would he do now that all his money was gone?\nWhat could he do except return to his father? Accordingly he went home.\n\n"You fool! You scamp!" exclaimed his father when he had heard how his son had\nwasted all the money that had been given to him. "Go and live in the stables\nand repent of your folly. You shall never again enter my house."\n\nSo the young man went and lived in the stables His bed was the grass spread\nfor the cattle, and his companions were the dog, the cat, and the snake, which\nhe had purchased so dearly. These creatures got very fond of him, and would\nfollow him about during the day, and sleep by him at night; the cat used to\nsleep at his feet, the dog at his head, and the snake over his body, with its\nhead hanging on one side and its tail on the other.\n\nOne day the snake in course of conversation said to its master, "I am the son\nof Raja Indrasha. One day, when I had come out of the ground to drink the air,\nsome people seized me, and would have slain me had you not most opportunely\narrived to my rescue. I do not know how I shall ever be able to repay you for\nyour great kindness to me. Would that you knew my father! How glad he would be\nto see his son\'s preserver!"\n\n"Where does he live? I should like to see him, if possible," said the young\nman.\n\n"Well said!" continued the snake. "Do you see yonder mountain? At the bottom\nof that mountain there is a sacred spring. If you will come with me and dive\ninto that spring, we shall both reach my father\'s country. Oh! how glad he\nwill be to see you! He will wish to reward you, too. But how can be do that?\nHowever, you may be pleased to accept something at his hand. If he asks you\nwhat you would like, you would, perhaps, do well to reply, \'The ring on your\nright hand, and the famous pot and spoon which you possess.\' With these in\nyour possession, you would never need anything, for the ring is such that a\nman has only to speak to it, and immediately a beautiful furnished mansion\nwill be provided for him, while the pot and the spoon will supply him with all\nmanner of the rarest and most delicious foods."\n\nAttended by his three companions the man walked to the well and prepared to\njump in, according to the snake\'s directions. "O master!" exclaimed the cat\nand dog, when they saw what he was going to do. "What shall we do? Where shall\nwe go?"\n\n"Wait for me here," he replied. "I am not going far. I shall not be long\naway." On saying this, he dived into the water and was lost to sight.\n\n"Now what shall we do?" said the dog to the cat.\n\n"We must remain here," replied the cat, "as our master ordered. Do not be\nanxious about food. I will go to the people\'s houses and get plenty of food\nfor both of us." And so the cat did, and they both lived very comfortably till\ntheir master came again and joined them.\n\nThe young man and the snake reached their destination in safety; and\ninformation of their arrival was sent to the Raja. His highness commanded his\nson and the stranger to appear before him. But the snake refused, saying that\nit could not go to its father till it was released from this stranger, who had\nsaved it from a most terrible death, and whose slave it therefore was. Then\nthe Raja went and embraced his son, and saluting the stranger welcomed him to\nhis dominions. The young man stayed there a few days, during which he received\nthe Raja\'s right-hand ring, and the pot and spoon, in recognition of His\nHighness\'s gratitude to him for having delivered his son. He then returned. On\nreaching the top of the spring he found his friends, the dog and the cat,\nwaiting for him. They told one another all they had experienced since they had\nlast seen each other, and were all very glad. Afterwards they walked together\nto the river side, where it was decided to try the powers of the charmed ring\nand pot and spoon.\n\nThe merchant\'s son spoke to the ring, and immediately a beautiful house and a\nlovely princess with golden hair appeared. He spoke to the pot and spoon,\nalso, and the most delicious dishes of food were provided for them. So he\nmarried the princess, and they lived very happily for several years, until one\nmorning the princess, while arranging her toilet, put the loose hairs into a\nhollow bit of reed and threw them into the river that flowed along under the\nwindow. The reed floated on the water for many miles, and was at last picked\nup by the prince of that country, who curiously opened it and saw the golden\nhair. On finding it the prince rushed off to the palace, locked himself up in\nhis room, and would not leave it. He had fallen desperately in love with the\nwoman whose hair be had picked up, and refused to eat, or drink, or sleep, or\nmove, till she was brought to him. The king, his father, was in great distress\nabout the matter, and did not know what to do. He feared lest his son should\ndie and leave him without an heir: At last he determined to seek the counsel\nof his aunt, who was an ogress. The old woman consented to help him, and bade\nhim not to be anxious, as she felt certain that she would succeed in getting\nthe beautiful woman for his son\'s wife.\n\nShe assumed the shape of a bee and went along buzzing, and buzzing, and\nbuzzing. Her keen sense of smell soon brought her to the beautiful princess,\nto whom she appeared as an old hag, holding in one hand a stick by way of\nsupport. She introduced herself to the beautiful princess and said, "I am your\naunt, whom you have never seen before, because I left the country just after\nyour birth." She also embraced and kissed the princess by way of adding force\nto her words. The beautiful princess was thoroughly deceived. She returned the\nogress\'s embrace, and invited her to come and stay in the house as long as she\ncould, and treated her with such honour and attention, that the ogress thought\nto herself, "I shall soon accomplish my errand." When she had been in the\nhouse three days, she began to talk of the charmed ring, and advised her to\nkeep it instead of her husband, because the latter was constantly out shooting\nand on other such-like expeditions, and might lose it. Accordingly the\nbeautiful princess asked her husband for the ring, and he readily gave it to\nher.\n\nThe ogress waited another day before she asked to see the precious thing.\nDoubting nothing, the beautiful princess complied, when the ogress seized the\nring, and reassuming the form of a bee flew away with it to the palace, where\nthe prince was lying nearly on the point of death. "Rise up. Be glad. Mourn no\nmore," she said to him. "The woman for whom you yearn will appear at your\nsummons. See, here is the charm, whereby you may bring her before you." The\nprince was almost mad with joy when he heard these words, and was so desirous\nof seeing the beautiful princess, that he immediately spoke to the ring, and\nthe house with its fair occupant descended in the midst of the palace garden.\nHe at once entered the building, and telling the beautiful princess of his\nintense love, entreated her to be his wife. Seeing no escape from the\ndifficulty, she consented on the condition that he would wait one month for\nher.\n\nMeanwhile the merchant\'s son had returned from hunting and was terribly\ndistressed not to find his house and wife. There was the place only, just as\nhe knew it before he had tried the charmed ring, which Raja Indrasha had given\nhim. He sat down and determined to put an end to himself. Presently the cat\nand dog came up. They had gone away and hidden themselves, when they saw the\nhouse and everything disappear. "O master!?\' they said, "stay your hand. Your\ntrial is great, but it can be remedied. Give us one month, and we will go and\ntry to recover your wife and house."\n\n"Go," said he, "and may the great God aid your efforts. Bring back my wife,\nand I shall live."\n\nSo the cat and dog started off at a run, and did not stop till they reached\nthe place whither their mistress and the house had been taken. "We may have\nsome difficulty here," said the cat. "Look, the king has taken our master\'s\nwife and house for himself. You stay here. I will go to the house and try to\nsee her." So the dog sat down, and the cat climbed up to the window of the\nroom, wherein the beautiful princess was sitting, and entered. The princess\nrecognised the cat, and informed it of all that had happened to her since she\nhad left them.\n\n"But is there no way of escape from the hands of these people?" she asked.\n\n"Yes," replied the cat, "if you can tell me where the charmed ring is."\n\n"The ring is in the stomach of the ogress," she said.\n\n"All right," said the cat, "I __ will recover it. If we once get it,\neverything is ours." Then the cat descended the wall of the house, and went\nand laid down by a rat\'s hole and pretended she was dead. Now at that time a\ngreat wedding chanced to be going on among the rat community of that place,\nand all the rats of the neighbourhood were assembled in that one particular\nmine by which the cat had lain down. The eldest son of the king of the rats\nwas about to be married. The cat got to know of this, and at once conceived\nthe idea of seizing the bridegroom and making him render the necessary help.\nConsequently, when the procession poured forth from the hole squealing and\njumping in honour of the occasion, it immediately spotted the bridegroom and\npounced down on him. "Oh! let me go, let me go," cried the terrified rat. "Oh!\nlet him go," squealed all the company. "It is his wedding day."\n\n"No, no," replied the cat. "Not unless you do something for me. Listen. The\nogress, who lives in that house with the prince and his wife, has swallowed a\nring, which I very much want. If you will procure it for me, I will allow the\nrat to depart unharmed. If you do not, then your prince dies under my feet."\n\n"Very well, we agree," said they all. "Nay, if we do not get the ring for you,\ndevour us all."\n\nThis was rather a bold offer. However, they accomplished the thing. At\nmidnight, when the ogress was sound asleep, one of the rats went to her\nbedside, climbed up on her face, and, inserted its tail into her throat;\nwhereupon the ogress coughed violently, and the ring came out and rolled on to\nthe floor. The rat immediately seized the precious thing and ran off with it\nto its king, who was very glad, and went at once to the cat and released its\nson.\n\nAs soon as the cat received the ring, she started back with the dog to go and\ntell their master the good tidings. All seemed safe now. They had only to give\nthe ring to him, and he would speak to it, and the house and beautiful\nprincess would again be with them, and everything would go on as happily as\nbefore. "How glad master will be!" they thought, and ran as fast as their legs\ncould carry them. Now, on the way they had to cross a stream. The dog swam,,\nand the cat sat on its back. Now the dog was jealous of the cat, so he asked\nfor the ring, and threatened to throw the cat into the water if it did not\ngive it up; whereupon the cat gave up the ring. Sorry moment, for the dog at\nonce dropped it, and a fish swallowed it.\n\n"Oh! what shall I do? what shall I do?" said the dog. "What is done is done,"\nreplied the cat. "We must try to recover it, and if we do not succeed we had\nbetter drown ourselves in this stream. I have a plan. You go and kill a small\nlamb, and bring it here to me."\n\n"All right," said the dog, and at once ran off. He soon came back with a dead\nlamb, and gave it to the cat. The cat got inside the lamb and lay down,\ntelling the dog to go away a little distance and keep quiet. Not long after\nthis a nadhar, a bird whose look can break the bones of a fish, came and\nhovered over the lamb, and eventually pounced down on it to carry it away. On\nthis the cat came out and jumped on to the bird, and threatened to kill it if\nit did not recover the lost ring. This was most readily promised by the\nnadhar, who immediately flew off to the king of the fishes, and ordered it to\nmake inquiries and to restore the ring. The king of the fishes did so, and the\nring was found and carried back to the cat.\n\n"Come along now; I have got the ring," said the cat to the dog.\n\n"No, I will not," said the dog, unless you let me have the ring. I can carry\nit as well as you. Let me have it or I will kill you." So the cat was obliged\nto give up the ring. The careless dog very soon dropped it again. This time it\nwas picked up and carried off by a kite.\n\n"See, see, there it goes--away to that big tree," the cat exclaimed.\n\n"Oh! oh! what have I done?" cried the dog.\n\n"You foolish thing, I knew it would be so," said the cat. "But stop your\nbarking, or you will frighten away the bird to some place where we shall not\nbe able to trace it."\n\nThe cat waited till it was quite dark, and then climbed the tree, killed the\nkite, and recovered the ring. "Come along," it said to the dog when it reached\nthe ground. "We must make haste now. We have been delayed. Our master will die\nfrom grief and suspense. Come on."\n\nThe dog, now thoroughly ashamed of itself, begged the cat\'s pardon for all the\ntrouble it had given. It was afraid to ask for the ring the third time, so\nthey both reached their sorrowing master in safety and gave him the precious\ncharm. In a moment his sorrow was turned into joy. He spoke to the ring, and\nhis beautiful wife and house reappeared, and he and everybody were as happy as\never they could be.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Talkative Tortoise](ift14.htm)\n\n'
