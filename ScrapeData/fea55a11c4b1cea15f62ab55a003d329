The (twelve) days of new moon, the three Ash _t_ akas, the three Anvash\n_t_ akas, a Magha day (i.e. 'day on which the moon enters the lunar asterism\nMagha'), which falls on the thirteenth of the dark half of the month Praush\n_th_ apada, and the two seasons when rice and barley grow ripe (or autumn and\nspring):\n\n[7. The Mantras are those quoted above, in Chapters LXXIII and LXXIV. They\nhave to be modified, i. e. the names of the maternal ancestors must be put in,\nand the verb &c. of the sentence be altered accordingly. (Nand.)\n\nLXXVI. I. M. III, 122, 273, 281; IV, 150; Y. I, 217, 260; Gaut. XV, 2; \xc3\x82past.\nII, 7, 16, 4-6.\n\n1\\. Nand. infers from a passage of \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana (G _ri_ hya-sutra II, 4, 3)\nthat _S_ raddhas to be offered on the day before each Ash _t_ aka are also\nintended here. See, however, note on LXXIII, 9. The same proposes two\nexplanations of the term Maghi: 1. It has to be separated from the following\nwords, and refers directly to the day of full moon in the month Magha, and\nindirectly to the days of full moon in \xc3\x82sha _dh_ a, Karttika, and Vai _s_ akha\nas well, as indicated in a passage of the Brahma-purana. 2. It has to be\nconnected with the clause following it. This latter interpretation, on which\nthe rendering given above is based, is supported by Mann (III, 273,274),\n{footnote p. 241} Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya, (I, 260), according to the interpretations\nof Kulluka and Vig\xc3\xb1ane _s_ vara, and by the Vish _n_ u-sutra itself (LXXVIII,\n52).]\n\np. 241\n\n2\\. Thus have the regular times for a Sraddha been declared by the lord of\ncreatures. He who fails to perform a _S_ raddha on those days, goes to hell.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: LXXVII.](sbe07079.htm)\n\n"
