The entering (of one soul into several bodies) is like (the\nmultiplication of) the flame of a lamp; for thus scripture declares.\n\nUnder Sutra 11 it has been shown that the released person is embodied. The\nquestion now arises whether the bodies which the released create for\nthemselves when rendering themselves threefold and so on are soulless like\nwooden figures, or animated by souls like the bodies of us men.--The\npurvapakshin maintains that as neither the soul nor the manas can be divided\nthey are joined with one body only, while the other bodies are soulless.--To\nthis the Sutrakara replies, 'Like the flame of a lamp is their entering,' i.e.\njust as the one flame of a lamp can pass over into several flames (lighted at\nthe original flame), because it possesses\n\np. 414\n\nthe power of modifying itself, thus the soul of him who knows, although one\nonly, multiplying itself through its lordly power, enters into all those\nbodies. For scripture declares that in this way one may become many, 'He is\nonefold, he is threefold, fivefold, sevenfold' ( _Kh_. Up. VII, 26, 2). And\nthis is not possible, if we should accept the simile of the wooden puppets, or\nthe entering of other souls into those additional bodies 1. Nor again can\nthere be any motion on the part of bodies destitute of souls.--Nor is there\nany force in the objection that, because the Self and the Manas cannot be\ndivided, they cannot be in connexion with more than one body. For the Self,\nbecause possessing the quality of having true wishes (i.e. wishes which become\nreal), may be supposed to create other bodies with internal organs,\nconformable to the original one organ; and, the Self dividing itself through\nthe division of its limiting adjuncts, it may be possible to give a soul to\neach created body. This is the topic which the books on Yoga treat, in the\nchapters explaining the connexion of one soul with several bodies.--But how\ncan lordly power, enabling the released soul to enter into several bodies, be\nadmitted, if we consider that different scriptural texts declare that the soul\nin that state has not any specific cognition? so e.g. 'Whereby should he know\nanother?' 'For there is then no second, nothing else different from him that\nhe could know;' 'An ocean is that one seer, without any duality' (B _ri_. Up.\nII, 4, 14; IV, 3, 30; 32).\n\nTo this objection the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[413:1](sbe38328.htm#fr_234) See Purva Mima _m_ sa-sutras II, 3, 5th adhikara\n_n_ a.\n\n[414:1](sbe38331.htm#fr_235) I.e. the scriptural statement about one Self\nrendering itself manifold can neither be reconciled with the hypothesis of the\nother bodies being moved by the one soul as puppets are moved by one person\nthrough strings, nor with the hypothesis of a new separate soul entering each\nnew body.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 4, 16](sbe38332.htm)\n\n"
