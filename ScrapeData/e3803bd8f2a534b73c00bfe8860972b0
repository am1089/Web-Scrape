Those not depending on symbols he leads, thus Badaraya _n_ a thinks;\nthere being a defect in both cases; and he whose thought is that.\n\nBadaraya _n_ a is of opinion that the deities lead those not depending on\nsymbols, i.e. all meditating devotees other than those depending on symbols.\nThat is to say. the view that those are led who meditate on the effected\nBrahman cannot be upheld; nor is there an exclusive rule that those only\nshould be led on who meditate on the highest Brahman. The truth is that those\nare led who meditate on the highest Brahman, and also those who meditate on\nthe Self (soul) as different from matter (Prak _ri_ ti) and having Brahman for\nits true Self. Souls of both these kinds are led on to Brahman. Those on the\nother hand whose object of meditation is such things as name and so on, which\nfall within what is a mere effect of Brahman--such things being viewed either\nunder the aspect of Brahman, just as some valiant man may be viewed under the\naspect of a lion (which view expresses itself in the judgment 'Devadatta is a\nlion '); or by themselves (without reference to Brahman)--all those are not\nled on to Brahman. Why so?' Because there is a defect in both cases,' i.e. in\nboth the views rejected by Badaraya _n_ a. The view that those are led who\nmeditate on the effected Brahman is in conflict with texts such as ' having\nrisen from this body and reached the highest light' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 12,\n3)--for the nature of the fruit depends on the nature of the meditation; and\n\np. 753\n\nthe view that those only are led to the highest Brahman who meditate on the\nhighest Brahman, would stultify texts such as the one which expressly declares\nAgni and the rest of the deities to lead on those who possess the knowledge of\nthe five fires ('Those who know this, viz. the Vidya of the five fires, and\nthose who in the forest meditate on faith and austerity go to light--there is\na person not human, he leads them to Brahman,' _Kh_. Up. V, 10). Both these\nviews thus being defective, we adhere to the conclusion that the deities lead\non to Brahman the two classes of souls mentioned above.--This the Sutra\nfurther declares in the words 'he whose thought is that' (tatkratu _h_ ), the\nsense of which is that he whose thought is that reaches that, i.e. that the\nnature of what is reached depends on the nature of the meditation. This\nargument is founded on the text, 'According to what his thought is (yatha-\nkratu _h_ ) in this world, so will he be when he has departed this life' (\n_Kh_. Up. III, 14), which implies the principle that what a soul after death\nattains is according to its thought and meditation in this life; and moreover\nwe have direct scriptural statements to the effect that those who possess the\nknowledge of the five fires proceed on the path of the Gods, and that those\nwho proceed on that path reach Brahman and do not return. Analogous reasoning\nproves that meditation on the soul as free from matter and having Brahman for\nits true Self also leads to the highest Brahman. In the case of those, on the\nother hand, who rely on the symbols (in which they meditatively contemplate\nBrahman), beginning with name and terminating with prana. ('He who meditates\non name as Brahman,' _Kh_. Up. VII, 1 ff.), the meditation is not proved by\ntexts of the two kinds previously mentioned to lead to Brahman; it rather is\ncontaminated by an element not of the nature of intelligence, and hence--\naccording to the principle that the result of a meditation is the same in\nnature as the meditation itself--the soul of the inferior devotee practising\nsuch meditation does not proceed by the path of light and does not reach\nBrahman.--That this distinction is declared by Scripture itself, the next\nSutra shows.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 15.
