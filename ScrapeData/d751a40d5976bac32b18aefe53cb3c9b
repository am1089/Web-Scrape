O Vayu, may the quick racers bring thee towards the offerings, to the\nearly drink [1](sbe3261.htm#an_1:23:1:1) here, to the early drink of Soma! May\nSun _ri_ ta [2](sbe3261.htm#an_1:23:1:2) (the Dawn) stand erect, approving thy\nmind! Come near on thy harnessed chariot to share, O Vayu, to share in the\nsacrifice [3](sbe3261.htm#an_1:23:1:3)!\n\n2\\. May the delightful drops of Soma delight thee, the drops made by us, well-\nmade, and heaven-directed, yes, made with milk, and heaven-directed. When his\nperformed aids assume strength for achievement, cur prayers implore the\nassembled steeds for gifts, yes, the prayers implore them.\n\n3\\. Vayu yokes the two ruddy, Vayu yokes the two red horses, Vayu yokes to the\nchariot the two swift horses to draw in the yoke, the strongest to draw in the\nyoke. Awake Purandhi (the Morning) [1](sbe3261.htm#an_1:23:3:1) as a lover\nwakes a sleeping maid, reveal heaven and earth, brighten the dawn, yes, for\nglory brighten the dawn.\n\n4\\. For thee the bright dawns spread out in the distance beautiful garments,\nin their houses [1](sbe3261.htm#an_1:23:4:1), in their rays, beautiful in\ntheir new rays. To thee the juice-yielding [2](sbe3261.htm#an_1:23:4:2) cow\npours out all treasures. Thou hast brought forth the Maruts from the flanks\n[3](sbe3261.htm#an_1:23:4:3), yes, from the flanks of heaven.\n\n5\\. For thee the white, bright, rushing Somas, strong in raptures, have rushed\nto the whirl, they\n\np. 445\n\nhave rushed to the whirl of the waters. The tired hunter asks luck of thee in\nthe chase [1](sbe3261.htm#an_1:23:5:1); thou shieldest\n[2](sbe3261.htm#an_1:23:5:2) by thy power from every being, yes, thou\nshieldest by thy power from powerful spirits [3](sbe3261.htm#an_1:23:5:3).\n\n6\\. Thou, O Vayu, art worthy as the first before all others to drink these our\nSomas, thou art worthy to drink these poured-out Somas. Among the people also\nwho invoke thee and have turned to thee [1](sbe3261.htm#an_1:23:6:1), all the\ncows pour out the milk, they pour out butter and milk (for the Soma).\n\np. 446\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nAscribed to Paru _k_ _kh_ epa Daivodasi, and addressed to Vayu. Metre, 1-5\nAtyash _t_ i; 6 Ash _t_ i. No verse occurs in the other Vedas.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Purvapiti may here imply that Vayu receives his libation first, before\nthe other gods, see verse 6.\n\nNote 2. Whatever the etymology of sun _ri_ ta may be, in our passage, which\ndescribes the morning sacrifice and the arrival of Vayu as the first of the\ngods, it can hardly mean anything but dawn. \xc3\x9brdhva stha is an expression\napplied frequently to the rise of the dawn or the morning, see III, 55, 14;\n61, 3; VIII, 45, 12. In the last passage sun _ri_ ta is simply the dawn.\nLudwig translates, 'deine treflichkeit erhebe sich, gunstig aufnemend die\nabsicht.' He, like Bergaigne, III, 295, takes sun _ri_ ta as su-n _ri_ -ta,\nvirtue. It seems to me that sun _ri_ ta may be formed irregularly in analogy\nto an- _ri_ ta, and then mean true, good. In other places sun _ri_ tam seems\nto mean hymn, like _ri_ tavaka, IX, 113, 2. In places where it occurs as a\nname of Ushas, one feels tempted to conjecture su-n _ri_ tus. See also\nBartholomae, in Bezzenb. Beitr. XV, 24.\n\nNote 3. On makhasya davane, see note to I, 6, 8; but also note to VIII, 7, 27.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nMy translation is purely tentative, and I doubt whether the text can be\ncorrect. I have taken kra _n_ a here in the sense of made, but I am quite\naware that this meaning becomes incongruous in our very verse, when repeated\nfor the third time. On its other meanings, see Pischel, Ved. Stud. p. 67. For\nthe whole verse, compare VI, 36, 3. Grassmann translates:\n\nDie lust'gen Indu's mogen, Vayu, dich erfreuen,  \nDie starken, die wir schon gebraut, die himmlischen,  \nDie milchgemischten, himmlischen;  \nWenn Tranke tuchtig deinen Sinn p. 447  \nUns zu gewinnen, bei dir sind,  \nDann fordere Lieder die vereinte Rosseschar,  \nDie Speisen zu empfangen auf.\n\nLudwig: Erfreuen sollen dich die frohen tropfen, Vayu, von uns bereitet, die\nmorgendlichen, mit milch bereitet, die morgendlichen, dasz der (opfer)\ntuchtigkeit zukomen hilfleistungen zum gelingen, gewart, die insgesammt\nherwarts gerichteten gespanne (antworten) zur (mit) beschenkung den liedern,\nihn sprechen an die lieder.\n\nThese translations may serve to show that certain verses in the Veda are\nsimply hopeless, and that the translators must not be held responsible if they\ncannot achieve the impossible.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Purandhi may have meant originally doorkeeper or bar-holder (cardo),\nfrom pu _h_ and dhi, being formed like ishudhi, v _r i_shandhi, _s_ evadhi,\n&c. Purandhri also may have been \xcf\x80\xcf\x85\xce\xbb\xcf\x89\xcf\x81\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x82, janitor, or rather janitrix, then\nhousewife. Grassmann translates it by Segensfulle, Ludwig by Fulle; Bergaigne,\nIII, 476, has a long note on purandhi, as one of the many names of 'la\nfemelle.' Whatever it meant etymologically, in our passage, where she is to be\nwoke by the wind in the morning (cf. ushasa _h_ budhi, I, 137, 2), it is again\na characteristic epithet of the dawn, \xcf\x80\xce\xbf\xce\xbb\xce\xb9\xce\xbf\xe1\xbf\xa6\xcf\x87\xce\xbf\xcf\x82, \xcf\x80\xce\xbf\xce\xbb\xce\xb9\xce\xac\xcf\x82, \xcf\x80\xce\xbf\xce\xb1\xe1\xbf\x96\xcf\x84\xce\xb9\xcf\x82. See also\nPischel, Vedica, p. 202; Hillebrandt, Wiener Zeitschrift, III, 188; 259.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. I have translated da _m_ su as a locative; could it be a nom. plur. of\nda _m_ su, \xce\xb4\xce\xb1\xcf\x83\xcf\x85, referring to vastra, the terminations being left out? see\nLanman, p. 415.\n\nNote 2. Sabardugha, juice-yielding. Roth explains it as quickly yielding,\nidentifying sabar with Greek \xe1\xbc\x84\xcf\x86\xce\xb1\xcf\x81. But Greek \xcf\x86 never represents Sanskrit b.\nSabar, juice, milk, water, would really seem to yield the true source of A. S.\nsaep, O. H. G. saf, sap, for it is clear that neither \xe1\xbd\x80\xcf\x80\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x82, nor Lat. sucus,\nwould correspond with A. S. saep; see Brugmann, Grundriss, vol. i, \xc2\xa7 328; also\nBartholomae, in, Bezzenb. Beitr. XV, 17.\n\np. 448\n\nNote 3. Vaksha _n_ abhya _h_ , from the flanks. It would be better if we could\nrefer vaksha _n_ abhya _h_ to Dhenu, the cow, the mother of the Maruts, while\nDyaus is their father, see V, 52, 16. Here, however, Vayu is conceived as\ntheir father, and dyaus (fem.) as their mother.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. I have followed Ludwig in his explanation of tsari, hunter, watcher,\nand takvaviya, chase of the takva, whatever animal it may be.\n\nNote 2. Oldenberg suggests pra\xc2\xb4si for pasi, which on many accounts would be\nexcellent.\n\nNote 3. On asurya\xcc\x86, see von Bradke, Dyaus Asura, p. 39, and Bergaigne, Journal\nAsiatique, 1884, p. 510.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Vihutmat is translated by Roth as not sacrificing. But vihutmat can\nhardly be separated from vihava and vihavya, and seems to mean therefore\ninvoking, possibly, invoking towards different sides. Hu, to sacrifice, does\nnot take the preposition vi. Vavar _g_ ushi is doubtful. Without some other\nwords, it can hardly mean 'those who have turned towards the gods,' as we read\nin X, 120, 3 (tve kratum api v _ri_ _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ anti vi _s_ ve); nor is it likely\nto be the same as v _ri_ kta-barhis, 'those who have prepared the barhis.'\n\nI have translated it in the former sense. See Geldner, Ved. Stud. p. 144, and\nOldenberg, Gott. Gel. Anz. 1890, p. 414.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: X, 168. To Vata](sbe3262.htm)\n\n"
