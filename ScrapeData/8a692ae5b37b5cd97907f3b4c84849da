[1885], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 135\n\n3:5:4\n\n### FOURTH BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n3:5:4:11\\. It is for a twofold reason that the sounding-holes are dug. The\ncart-shed, truly, is the head of the sacrificer; and what four holes there are\nhere in the head--namely, these two and these two 1\\--those he thereby makes:\nfor this reason he digs the sounding-holes.\n\n3:5:4:22\\. Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra _g_\napati, were contending. The Asuras then by way of witchcraft buried charms 2\nwithin these worlds, thinking, 'Peradventure we may thus overcome the gods.'\n\n3:5:4:33\\. The gods then prevailed. By means of these (sounding-holes) they\ndug up those magic charms. Now, when a charm is dug up, it becomes inoperative\nand useless. And in like manner, if any malicious enemy buries here charms by\nway of witchcraft for this (sacrificer), does he thereby dig them up; this is\nwhy he digs sounding-holes. He digs just beneath the fore-part of the shafts\nof the southern cart.\n\n3:5:4:44\\. He takes up the spade 3, with the text (Va _g_. S. V, 22),\n\np. 136\n\n[paragraph continues] 'At the impulse of the divine Savit _ri_ , I take thee\nwith the arms of the A _s_ vins, with the hands of Pushan: thou art a woman.'\nThe significance of this formula is the same (as before). That spade (abhri,\nfem.) is indeed a female: therefore he says 'thou art a woman.'\n\n3:5:4:55\\. He draws their outlines, saving 1 the measure of a span, with,\n'Here do I cut off the necks of the Rakshas!' For the spade is the\nthunderbolt: it is with the thunderbolt that he thus cuts off the necks of the\nRakshas.\n\n3:5:4:66\\. Let him first mark off the right (southern) one of the two that are\nin front; then the left one of the two behind; then the right one of those\nbehind; then the left one of those in front.\n\n3:5:4:77\\. But they say conversely, that he should mark off first the left one\nof the two behind; then the right one of those in front; then the right one of\nthose behind; and then the left one of those in front. Or he may also mark\nthem off in one and the same direction 2: but let him, in any case, mark off\nlast of all the one which is on the left of those in front.\n\n3:5:4:88\\. He digs them, in the very same order in which they have been marked\noff, with, 'Thou art great,\n\np. 137\n\nof great sound!'--he praises and extols them, when he says, 'Thou art great,\nof great sound;'--'Utter thou the great voice unto Indra!'--Indra, forsooth,\nis the deity of the sacrifice; and the cart-shed belonging to Vish _n_ u, he\nthereby makes it to be connected with Indra: therefore he says, 'Utter thou\nthe great voice unto Indra!'\n\n3:5:4:99\\. 'The Rakshas-killing, charm-killing (voice),' for it is indeed for\nthe killing of the charms of the Rakshas that these (holes) are dug;--'Of Vish\n_n_ u;' for that voice in the cart-shed is indeed Vish _n_ u's.\n\n3:5:4:1010\\. He throws out (the earth from) them in the order in which he has\ndug them, with (Va _g_. S. V, 23), 'Here do I cast out the charm which the\nalien, which the inmate of my house has buried for me!' Either an alien or an\ninmate of his house buries charms by way of witchcraft: these he thereby casts\nout.\n\n3:5:4:1111\\. 'Here do I cast out the charm which my equal, which my unequal\nhas buried for me!' Either one equal, or one unequal, to him buries charms by\nway of witchcraft: these he thereby casts out.\n\n3:5:4:1212\\. 'Here do I cast out the charm which the kinsman, which the\nstranger has buried for me!' Either a kinsman or a stranger buries charms by\nway of witchcraft: these he thereby casts out.\n\n3:5:4:1313\\. 'Here do I cast out the charm which the countryman, which the\nforeigner has buried for me!' Either a countryman or a foreigner buries charms\nby way of witchcraft: these he thereby casts out. With 'I cast out\nwitchcraft!' he finally\n\np. 138\n\nthrows out (the earth remaining in the several holes 1), whereby he casts out\nwitchcraft.\n\n3:5:4:1414\\. Let him dig them arm-deep; for that being the end (extreme limit\nto which he can reach) he thereby in the end brings witchcraft to naught. He\nconnects them crossways by (underground) channels 2; or, if he cannot\ncrossways, he may do so in one and the same direction. This is why these\n(openings of the) vital airs are connected by channels farther (inside).\n\n3:5:4:1515\\. In the same order in which he has dug them he makes (the\nsacrificer) touch them, with the texts (Va _g_. S. V, 24), 'Self-ruling thou\nart, a slayer of enemies! Ever-ruling thou art, a slayer of haters! Man-ruling\nthou art, a slayer of Rakshas! All-ruling thou art, a slayer of foe-men!' This\nis the blessing of that work: he thereby invokes a blessing.\n\n3:5:4:1616\\. The Adhvaryu and Sacrificer then touch one another (with their\nright hands through the holes), the Adhvaryu is at the right one of those in\nfront, and the Sacrificer at the left one of those behind. The Adhvaryu asks,\n'Sacrificer, what is here?'--'Happiness!' he says.--'(Be) that ours in\ncommon!' says the Adhvaryu in a low voice.\n\n3:5:4:1717\\. Thereupon the Adhvaryu is at the right one of those behind, and\nthe Sacrificer at the left one of those in front. The Sacrificer asks,\n'Adhvaryu, what is here?'--'Happiness!' he says.--'(Be) that mine!' says the\nSacrificer. Now in that they thus\n\np. 139\n\ntouch one another, thereby they make the vital airs yoke-fellows: hence these\nvital airs meet together farther (inside). And in that, when asked, he\nreplies, 'Happiness (bhadram),' thereby he utters the wish of 'prosperity\n(kalya _n_ am)' of ordinary speech: that is why, being asked, he replies,\n'Happiness.' Thereupon he sprinkles (the holes with water): one and the same\nforsooth is the significance of sprinkling; he thereby renders them pure.\n\n3:5:4:1818\\. He sprinkles, with the text (Va _g_. S. V, 25), 'You, the\nRakshas-killers, the charm-killers;' for they are indeed Rakshas-killers as\nwell as charm-killers; 'Vish _n_ u's own, I sprinkle;' for they indeed belong\nto Vish _n_ u.\n\n3:5:4:1919\\. What remains of the sprinkling-water he then pours out into the\npits;--what moisture there is here in the vital airs 1, that he thereby puts\ninto them: hence that moisture in the vital airs.\n\n3:5:4:2020\\. He pours it out with, 'You, the Rakshas-killers, the charm-\nkillers, Vish _n_ u's own, I pour out.' Thereupon he spreads barhis-grass,\nboth such as is turned with its tops to the east and such as is turned to the\nnorth 2; what hair there is here at (the openings of) the vital airs, that he\nthereby bestows: hence that hair at (the openings of) the vital airs.\n\n3:5:4:2121\\. He spreads it with, 'You, the Rakshas-killers, the charm-killers,\nVish _n_ u's own, I spread.' He, as it were, covers the bodies on the top, for\nthat (grass) is indeed his (Vish _n_ u's) hair 3.\n\np. 140\n\n3:5:4:2222\\. Thereon he lays two pressing-boards 1 with, 'You, the Rakshas-\nkillers, the charm-killers, Vish _n_ u's own, I lay down;' they are indeed his\n(Vish _n_ u's) jaws. He surrounds them (with earth) with, 'You, the Rakshas-\nkillers, the charm-killers, Vish _n_ u's own, I surround;' he thereby steadies\nthem, makes them immovable.\n\n3:5:4:2323\\. Now the pressing-skin is cut straight all round and (dyed) red\nall over, for it is his (Vish _n_ u's) tongue: the reason, then, why it is\nquite red, is because this tongue is, as it were, red. He lays it down with,\n'Thou art Vish _n_ u's own;' for it indeed belongs to Vish _n_ u 2.\n\n3:5:4:2424\\. He then brings down the (five) press-stones. The press-stones,\ndoubtless, are his (Vish _n_ u's) teeth: hence, when they press (the Soma)\nwith the stones it is as if he chewed with his teeth. He puts them down with,\n'Ye are Vish _n_ u's own;' for they indeed belong to Vish _n_ u. Thus, then,\nthe head of the sacrifice is complete.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[135:1](sbe2622.htm#fr_368) Viz. the ears and nostrils.\n\n[135:2](sbe2622.htm#fr_369) K _ri_ tyam valagan ni _k_ akhnu _h_ , 'they dug\nin, as a charm, secret (magic) objects.' Valaga is explained as charms,\nconsisting of bones, nails, hair, foot-dust, and similar objects, tied up in a\npiece of worn matting or cloth, or the like, and dug into the ground arm-deep,\nfor causing injury to enemies.

They are themselves to be round, a span in diameter. Hence\nby connecting the four centres by lines, a square of two spans (of thumb and\nforefinger), or one cubit, is obtained.
