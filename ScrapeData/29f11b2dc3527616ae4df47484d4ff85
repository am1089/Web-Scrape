As regards (the mode of subsistence called) Sha _n_ _n_ ivartani, (that)\nis (as follows):\n\np. 288\n\n2\\. He cultivates six Nivartanas (of) fallow (land); he gives a share to the\nowner (of the soil), or solicits his permission (to keep the whole produce). 2\n\n3\\. Let him plough before breakfast with two bulls whose noses have not been\npierced, not striking (them) with the goad, (but) frequently coaxing (them). 3\n\n4\\. If he cultivates six Nivartanas in this manner (and subsists thereby),\nthat is (the mode of living called) Sha _n_ _n_ ivartani (subsistence on six\nNivartanas).\n\n5\\. (As regards the mode of subsistence called) Kauddali, he digs up (the\nsoil) near a water(-course or tank) with a spade, a ploughshare, or a pointed\npiece of wood, sows seed, (and) grows bulbs, roots, fruit, pot-herbs, and\nvegetables.\n\n6\\. (If he thus) cultivates (land) with a spade (and lives on its produce),\nthat is the (mode of life called) Kauddali (subsistence by the spade). 6\n\n7\\. He who lives by the (mode of subsistence called) Dhruva, wraps up his head\nin a white dress (saying), \'For the sake of welfare I wrap thee up, O head,\'\n(and) takes the skin of a black antelope (with the words), \'(Thou art)\nspiritual pre-eminence, (I take thee) for the sake of spiritual pre-eminence;\'\nthe Pavitra (reciting) the Abli\xe1\xb9\x85ga texts; the water-pot (saying), \'Thou art\nstrength, (I take) thee for 7\n\np. 289\n\nthe sake of strength;\' the yoke for carrying burdens (saying), \'Thou art\ngrain, (I take) thee for the sake of prosperity;\' the staff (saying), \'(Thou\nart) a friend, protect me.\'\n\n8\\. On leaving (his hut), he mutters the Vyah _ri_ tis, and (afterwards the\nverse used for) hallowing the quarters of the horizon, \'May the earth, the\nmiddle sphere, the sky, the constellations, and all the quarters of the\nhorizon, fire, air, and sun, (may all these) deities protect me on my road.\'\n\n9\\. Because, after muttering the Manastokiya (text) and entering the village,\nhe shows himself with the yoke (on his shoulder) at the door of each house,\nthey call it \'showing oneself.\'\n\n10\\. Because, if every (other) livelihood fails, he persistently (dhruvam)\nsupports himself by this (mode of living), it is called Dhruva (the\nunchangeable). 10\n\n11\\. (As regards the mode of life called) Samprakshalani, (if, in order to\nshow that) there is no waste of the vegetable (substances) obtained nor 11\n\np. 290\n\nany hoarding, he turns the dishes, after washing them, upside down, (that is\nthe livelihood called) Samprakshalani (living by washing).\n\n12\\. As to the (mode of subsistence called) Samuha, (if) he sweeps up (grain)\nwith a broom in permitted places where (grain-bearing) plants are found,\neither on a road or in fields the access to which is not obstructed (by\nhedges), and lives on (what he has thus obtained), that (livelihood is called)\nSamuha (living by sweeping).\n\n13\\. As to the (mode of life called) Palani, it is also named Ahi _m_ saka\n(not hurting), and the following (definition) is given. (If) he tries to\nobtain from virtuous men husked rice or seeds, and maintains (himself)\nthereby, that (is the mode of subsistence called) Palani. 13\n\n14\\. As to the (mode of life called) Silo _\xc3\xb1_ _kh_ a, (if) he gleans single\nears in permitted places where (grain-bearing) plants grow, on a road or in\nfields the access to which is not obstructed, and supports himself by (these)\ngleanings, (collected) from time\n\np. 291\n\nto time, that (is the mode of subsistence called) Silo _\xc3\xb1_ _kh_ a (gleaning).\n\n15\\. As to the (livelihood called) Kapota, (if) he picks up with two fingers\nsingle grains in permitted places, where (grain-bearing) plants grow, either\non the road or in fields the access to which is not obstructed, that (is\ncalled), because he acts like a pigeon, Kapota (pigeon-life). 15\n\n16\\. As to (the mode of life called) Siddho _\xc3\xb1_ _kh_ a, (if) tired with the\n(other) ways of subsistence, he asks, because he has become old or diseased,\nvirtuous men for cooked food, that (is the livelihood called) Siddho _\xc3\xb1_ _kh_\na (gleaning cooked food). 16\n\n17\\. If (he adopts) the latter, he must reposit (the sacred fires) in his soul\nand behave like an ascetic, except (in using) the cloth for straining water\nand (wearing) a reddish-brown dress.\n\n18\\. If he subsists on the produce of the forest, (the fruits) of trees,\ncreepers. and lianas, and of grasses, such as wild millet ( _s_ yamaka) and\nwild sesamum, that (is called) forest-life.\n\n19\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): \'Moving about with the beasts,\ndwelling together with them, and maintaining oneself in a manner similar to\ntheirs, that is clearly the road to heaven.\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[288:2](sbe1474.htm#fr_1340) **2**. A Nivartana is a measure of 4000 square\nhastas, the ancient equivalent of the modern Bigha.\n\n[288:3](sbe1474.htm#fr_1341) Identical with II, 2, 4, 21.\n\n[288:6](sbe1474.htm#fr_1342) Govinda says that according to some the following\nceremonies need only be performed when one goes out begging for the first\ntime, while others insist on their being performed daily.\n\n[288:7](sbe1474.htm#fr_1343) The Manastokiya, i.e. the text beginning \'ma nas\ntoke,\' p. 289 occurs repeatedly in the Taittiriya-veda, e.g. Taitt. Sa _m_\nhita III, 4, 11, 2. Govinda adds that the beggar must remain silent, and rot\nstop longer at each door than the time required for milking a cow.\n\n[289:10](sbe1474.htm#fr_1344) Both the text and the scanty commentary on this\nSutra are corrupt. K. reads, v _ri_ tter v _ri_ ttair avartaya _m_ tayaiva\ntasya dhruva _m_ varttayatiti dhruveti parikirtita; D. v _ri_ tte v _ri_ ttair\navarttatha, &c.; M. v _ri_ tte v _ri_ tter av _ri_ ttayam av _ri_ ttaya _m_\ntathaiva tasya _h_ ddh _ri_ va _m_ varttamanad iti, &c.; C. I. v _ri_ tter v\n_ri_ tter avartayam avartayam tathaiva tasya _m_ dhruva _m_ vartanad iti, &c.\nThe Telugu copy omits the text. From the commentary it is clear that Govinda\nread at the beginning of the Sutra v _ri_ tter v _ri_ tter,\' and the Telugu\ncopy proves that \'tayaiva\' is the correct reading. I restore the Sutra\nconjecturally; as follows, v _ri_ tter v _ri_ tter avarttaya _m_ tayaiva tasya\ndhruva _m_ vartanad it dhruveti parikirtita.\n\n[289:11](sbe1474.htm#fr_1345) 1 read, samprakshalaniti | utpannanam oshadhinam\nprakshepa _n_ a _m_ p. 290 nastiti ni _k_ ayo va bha _g_ anani sa _m_\nprakshalya nyub _g_ ayatiti samprakshalani || M. has nasti ni _k_ ayo va, and\nC. I. reads also ni _k_ ayo and omits \'va\' The Dekhan MSS. have nastiti _k_\nayo va. The description is not very clear; but it seems that a person who\nlives by the Samprakshalani v _ri_ tti must obtain grain and vegetables by\nbegging in such quantities as will suffice for one meal, and prove by the way\nin which he treats his dishes that he has neither wasted his food nor any\nstore remaining.\n\n[290:13](sbe1474.htm#fr_1346) The translation of this Satin is merely\ntentative, as the two MSS. of the commentary omit the text, and contain only a\nfragment of Govinda\'s explanation. The latter seems to have differed from my\ninterpretation. The text, as given by the other MSS., runs as follows:\npalanity [pali\xc2\xb0, MSS.] ahi _m_ sakety evedam uktam bhavati [\xc2\xb0titi, M.]\ntushavihina _m_ s ta _n_ _d_ ulan i _k_ _kh_ ati sa _g_ _g_ anebhyo bigani va\n[ _k_ a, D.] palayatiti palani [phala\xc2\xb0, phalani, M.; palino, K. D.]\n\n[291:15](sbe1474.htm#fr_1347) Govinda mentions a varia lectio not found in our\nMSS., kapotavatsa _m_ da _m_ _s_ ini, \'because he pecks like a pigeon.\'\n\n[291:16](sbe1474.htm#fr_1348) Here as well as above, III, 1, 7, the Dekhan\nMSS. read siddhe _k_ _kh_ a,\' begging cooked food,\' instead of", siddho _\xc3\xb1_\n_kh_ a.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na III, Adhyaya 3](sbe1475.htm)\n\n'
