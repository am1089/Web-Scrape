Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing thus the words of the King Haris\xc2\x92chandra,\nthe Mahar _s_ i Kaus\xc2\x92ika smilingly said :-- \xc2\x93O King! This Tirath is very\nsacred; if one bathes here, one is cleansed of one\xc2\x92s sins and virtue springs\nup. So, highly fortunate One! Bathe in this and do peace-offerings (tarpa _n_\nam) to your fathers. O King! This time is very auspicious and highly\nmeritorious; so take a bath in this sacred Pu _n_ ya Tirtha and make charities\nas far as it lies in your power. Svayambhuva Manu says :-- He, who arriving at\na tirtha capable to give high merits (Pu _n_ ya), does not bathe and make\ncharities, deceives himself; so he is the slayer of his soul, no doubt. So, O\nKing! Do meritorious acts as best as you can in this excellent tirtha. Then I\nwill shew you the way and you will go to Ayodhya. O Kakutstha! Today I will be\npleased with your gifts and I will accompany you to show you the way; this I\nhave decided.\xc2\x94 Hearing the deceitful words of the Mahar _s_ i, the King took\noff his upper garments and tying the horse on to a tree, went towards the\nriver to bathe according to due rites. O King! The accidental combination,\nthat was to have been so (sure to come), so enchanted the King by the Muni\xc2\x92s\nwords, that he got himself entirely under the control of the Muni. He duly\ncompleted his bath and offered peace offerings to the Devas and the Pitris and\nthen spoke to Vis\xc2\x92vamitra. \xc2\x93O Lord! I am now making gifts to you. O Fortunate\nOne! Cows, lands, jewels, elephants, horses, chariots or horses, etc.,\nanything that you like I will give you just now. There is nothing that I\ncannot give. When I performed previously the Rajasuya\n\n\n\np. 658\n\n\n\nsacrifice, I took, then, before all the Munis, this vow. So, O Muni! You are\nalso present at this principal Tirtha (place of pilgrimage); so express what\nyou desire; I will give you your desired object.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n13-15. Vis\xc2\x92vamitra said :-- \xc2\x93O King! Your glory is spread far and wide in this\nworld; especially I have already heard that there is no second man charitable\nlike you. The Muni Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha has said :-- The\n\nKing of the solar dynasty, the Tris\xc2\x92anku\xc2\x92s son, Haris\xc2\x92chandra is foremost and\nfirst amongst the kings in this world and there is no one so liberal-minded as\nhe is; such a king there never was nor ever there will be. So, O King! Now the\nmarriage time of my son has arrived; so I pray before you today, that you give\nme wealth to celebrate this marriage.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n16\\. The King said :-- \xc2\x93O Brahmi _n_! Yes! Celebrate the marriage ceremony; I\nwill give you your desired wealth. What more can be said than this that\nwhatever wealth you would want, I will give that abundantly. There is no doubt\nin this.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n17-22. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing these words of the King, the Muni\nKaus\xc2\x92ika became ready to deceive him and originating the Gandharbi Maya,\ncreated a beautiful youth and one daughter aged ten years and showing them to\nthe King, said, \xc2\x93The marriage of these two is to be celebrated today. O King!\nTo marry the boys and the girls in the house-hold is to earn more merits than\nthe Rajasuya sacrifice. So today you will get that desired fruit if you make\ncharities for the marriage of this Brahmi _n_ Youth.\xc2\x94 The King was much\nenchanted by his Maya; so no sooner he heard those words, he immediately\npromised :-- \xc2\x93That will be done,\xc2\x94 he did not raise any objection whatsoever.\nVis\xc2\x92vamitra then showed the way and the King went to his city. Vis\xc2\x92vamitra,\ntoo, thus deceiving the King, went back to his \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92rama. When the King was\nstaying in Agnis\xc2\x92ala (cook-room), Vis\xc2\x92vamitra Muni went to him and said :-- \xc2\x93O\nKing! The marriage rites have been finished; so today give me what I desire in\nthis sacrificial hall.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n23-24. The King said :-- \xc2\x93O Brahmi _n_! Speak out what you want; now I like to\nget fame. So if there be anything in the world, that is not to be given by me,\nif you want, I will give that even to you, no doubt. The mortal, possessing\nall wealth, if he does not earn good name and fame, capable to give happiness\nto him in his next world, passes his life in vain.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n25\\. Vis\xc2\x92vamitra said :-- \xc2\x93O King! Give to this bridegroom, while within this\nsacred sacrificial altar, your entire kingdom with the royal umbrella and\nChamara for fanning the king and elephants, horses, chariots, infantry and all\nthe gems and jewels.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\np. 659\n\n\n\n26-33. Vyasa said :-- O King! The King Haris\xc2\x92chandra was deluded by his Maya;\nso no sooner he heard the Muni\xc2\x92s words, he willingly said without the\nslightest consideration :-- \xc2\x93O Muni! I give as you pray, my this vast dominion\nto you.\xc2\x94 The very cruel Vis\xc2\x92vamitra then said :-- \xc2\x93O King! I have accepted\nyour offer; but O Intelligent One! Give now the requisite Dak _s_ i _n_ a to\ncomplete your gift. Manu says gift without Dak _s_ i _n_ a is fruitless; so to\nget the fruit of your gift give Dak _s_ i _n_ a as duly fixed.\xc2\x94 The King was\nexceedingly surprised to hear this and said :-- \xc2\x93O Lord! Kindly say what\namount of wealth am I to give to you as Dak _s_ i _n_ a. O Saint! Say the\nvalue of your Dak _s_ i _n_ a. O Ascetic! Don\xc2\x92t be impatient; I will give you\nthe Dak _s_ i _n_ a to that amount, no doubt.\xc2\x94 Hearing this, Vis\xc2\x92vamitra told\nto the King :-- \xc2\x93At present give me two and a half loads of gold as Dak _s_ i\n_n_ a.\xc2\x94 The King Haris\xc2\x92chandra became greatly amazed and promised :-- \xc2\x93I will\ngive you that,\xc2\x94 he then anxiously mounted on his horseback and became ready to\ngo quickly. At this time, his soldiers who lost their road in quest of their\nking, came to him. They were very glad to see him; but, seeing him anxious,\nthey began to praise him in great haste.\n\n\n\n34-47. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing their words, the King did not say\nanything, good or bad; but thinking on his own doing entered into the zenana.\nOh! What have I promised to give? I have made a gift of all that I have; I am\ncheated in this matter by the Muni like one robbed by a thief in a wilderness.\nMy whole dominion including my dress I have promised to give to him. Moreover\nI will have to pay besides two and a half loads of gold. My brain seems to\nhave been completely destroyed. What to do now? I did not know the cunningness\nof the Muni. Therefore I am cheated by this deceitful Brahmi _n_. It is next\nto impossible to understand the work of Daiva. Oh! My Fate! What will happen\nto me now? Very much bewildered the King entered in the interior of the\npalace. The queen seeing her husband immersed in cares, enquired into the\ncause, thus :-- \xc2\x93O Lord Why have you become so absent-minded? Kindly say what\nyou are thinking now? O King! The son has come back from the forest before you\ncompleted your Rajasuya sacrifice; why then are you in grief now? Kindly speak\nout the cause of your sorrow. Nowhere is your enemy, strong or weak; only Varu\n_n_ a was angry with you; now he is also very satisfied. So there is nothing\nfurther for you to do to think. O King! Owing to cares, this body gets weaker\nand weaker day by day. So nothing is like cares to lead one to death.\xc2\x94 When\nhis dear wife said so, the King expressed to her somewhat the cause of his\n\n\n\np. 660\n\n\n\ncares, good or bad. But the King was much absorbed with his cares so that he\ncould not eat nor sleep though his bedding was perfectly white and clear.\nEarly in the next morning, when, getting up from his bed, he was doing\nanxiously his morning duties, Vis\xc2\x92vamitra came up there. When the sentinel\ninformed the King of the arrival of Vis\xc2\x92vamitra, he gave order for him to\nenter. Vis\xc2\x92vamitra, the Looter of his all and everything, came before him and\ntold the King who repeatedly bowed down to him :-- \xc2\x93O King! Now leave your\nkingdom and give me the gold that you promised as Dak _s_ i _n_ a and prove\nthat you are truthful.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n48-63. Haris\xc2\x92chandra said :-- \xc2\x93O Lord! I have given you this vast dominion of\nmine; so my Kingdom has now become yours; I am leaving this Kingdom and going\nto somewhere else. O Kaus\xc2\x92ika! You need not think a bit for this. O Brahma _n_\na! You have taken my all according to the technical rule; so now I am unable\nto give you Dak _s_ i _n_ a. If, in time, wealth comes to me, I will at once\ngive you your Dak _s_ i _n_ a.\xc2\x94 Saying him thus, the King told his wife\nS\xc2\x92aivya, and his son Rohita, \xc2\x93In this Agnihotra room I say that I have given\nmy vast dominion to the Muni Vis'vamitra. Elephants, horses, chariots, gold\nand jewels all I have given to him along with my kingdom. What more than this\nthat save us three, everything else I have given to him. O Mahar _s_ i! Take\nfully this prosperous dominion; we are going somewhere else to a forest or a\nmountain cave.\xc2\x94 The exceedingly virtuous Haris\xc2\x92chandra spoke thus to his wife\nand son, and, paying respects to the Muni, went out from his house. Seeing the\nKing going thus away, his wife and son, afflicted with cares, followed him\nwith their sad faces. Seeing thus, all the inhabitants of Ayodhya cried aloud,\nand great consternation and uproar arose in the city. O King! What is this act\nthat you have done? How has this suffering come to you! O King! The great\nFate, without any consideration, has certainly deceived you. The Brahma _n_\nas, K _s \xc2\x92_attriyas, Vais\xc2\x92yas and S\xc2\x92udras, all the four Var _n_ as gave vent\nto their sorrows, when they saw the King going away with his wife and son. The\nBrahmi _n_ s and the other inhabitants of the city, all were afflicted with\nsorrows and began to abuse the vicious Brahma _n_ a saying that \xc2\x93He is a\ncheat, etc.\xc2\x94 O King! Give the gold for Dak _s_ i _n_ a and then go; or say\nthat you will not be able to give and I will then not take the Dak _s_ i _n_\na. Or if you entertain within yourself any greed, then take back all your\nKingdom. O King! If you think that you have really made this gift, then give\nwhat you have promised. The son of Gadhi was saying so, when the King\nHaris\xc2\x92chandra very humbly bowed down to him with folded palms and said to him.\n\n\n\np. 661\n\n\n\nHere ends the Nineteenth Chapter of the Seventh Book on the taking away of\nHaris\xc2\x92chandra\xc2\x92s Kingdom in the Maha Pura _n_ am S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of\n18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 20](bk07ch20.htm)\n\n"
