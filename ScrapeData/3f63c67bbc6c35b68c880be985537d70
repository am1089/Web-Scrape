The aka _s_ a, i.e. ether (is Brahman) on account of characteristic marks\n(of the latter being mentioned).\n\nIn the _Kh_ andogya (I, 9) the following passage is met with, 'What is the\norigin of this world?' 'Ether,' he replied. 'For all these beings take their\nrise from the ether only, and return into the ether. Ether is greater than\nthese, ether is their rest.'--Here the following doubt arises. Does the word\n'ether' denote the highest Brahman or the elemental ether?--Whence the doubt?\n--Because the word is seen to be used in both senses. Its use in the sense of\n'elemental ether' is well established in ordinary as well as in Vedic speech;\n\np. 82\n\nand, on the other hand, we see that it is sometimes used to denote Brahman,\nviz. in cases where we ascertain, either from some complementary sentence or\nfrom the fact of special qualities being mentioned, that Brahman is meant. So,\nfor instance, Taitt. Up. II, 7, 'If that bliss existed not in the ether;' and\n_Kh_. Up. VIII, 14, 'That which is called ether is the revealer of all forms\nand names; that within which forms and names are 1 that is Brahman.' Hence the\ndoubt.--Which sense is then to be adopted in our case?--The sense of elemental\nether, the purvapakshin replies; because this sense belongs to the word more\ncommonly, and therefore presents itself to the mind more readily. The word\n'ether' cannot be taken in both senses equally, because that would involve a\n(faulty) attribution of several meanings to one and the same word. Hence the\nterm 'ether' applies to Brahman in a secondary (metaphorical) sense only; on\naccount of Brahman being in many of its attributes, such as all pervadingness\nand the like, similar to ether. The rule is, that when the primary sense of a\nword is possible, the word must not be taken in a secondary sense. And in the\npassage under discussion only the primary sense of the word 'ether' is\nadmissible. Should it be objected that, if we refer the passage under\ndiscussion to the elemental ether, a complementary passage ('for all these\nbeings take their rise from the ether only, &c.') cannot be satisfactorily\naccounted for; we reply that the elemental ether also may be represented as a\ncause, viz. of air, fire, &c. in due succession. For we read in Scripture\n(Taitt. Up. II, 1), 'From that Self sprang ether, from ether air, from air\nfire, and so on.' The qualities also of being greater and of being a place of\nrest may be ascribed to the elemental ether, if we consider its relations to\nall other beings. Therefore we conclude that the word 'ether' here denotes the\nelemental ether.\n\nTo this we reply as follows:--The word ether must here be taken to denote\nBrahman, on account of characteristic marks of the latter being mentioned. For\nthe sentence,\n\np. 83\n\n[paragraph continues] 'All these beings take their rise from the ether only,'\nclearly indicates the highest Brahman, since all Vedanta-texts agree in\ndefinitely declaring that all beings spring from the highest Brahman.--But,\nthe opponent may say, we have shown that the elemental ether also may be\nrepresented as the cause, viz. of air, fire, and the other elements in due\nsuccession.--We admit this. But still there remains the difficulty, that,\nunless we understand the word to apply to the fundamental cause of all, viz.\nBrahman, the affirmation contained in the word 'only' and the qualification\nexpressed by the word 'all' (in 'all beings') would be out of place. Moreover,\nthe clause, 'They return into the ether,' again points to Brahman, and so\nlikewise the phrase, 'Ether is greater than these, ether is their rest;' for\nabsolute superiority in point of greatness Scripture attributes to the highest\nSelf only; cp. _Kh_. Up. III, 14, 3, 'Greater than the earth, greater than the\nsky, greater than heaven, greater than all these worlds.' The quality of being\na place of rest likewise agrees best with the highest Brahman, on account of\nits being the highest cause. This is confirmed by the following scriptural\npassage: 'Knowledge and bliss is Brahman, it is the rest of him who gives\ngifts' (B _ri_. Up. III, 9, 28). Moreover, _G_ aivali finding fault with the\ndoctrine of _S_ alavatya, on account of (his saman) having an end ( _Kh_. Up.\nI, 8, 8), and wishing to proclaim something that has no end chooses the ether,\nand then, having identified the ether with the Udgitha, concludes, 'He is the\nUdgitha greater than great; he is without end.' Now this endlessness is a\ncharacteristic mark of Brahman. To the remark that the sense of 'elemental\nether' presents itself to the mind more readily, because it is the better\nestablished sense of the word aka _s_ a, we reply, that, although it may\npresent itself to the mind first, yet it is not to be accepted, because we see\nthat qualities of Brahman are mentioned in the complementary sentences. That\nthe word aka _s_ a is also used to denote Brahman has been shown already; cp.\nsuch passages as, 'Ether is the revealer of all names and forms.' We see,\nmoreover, that various synonyma of aka _s_ a are employed to denote Brahman.\nSo, for instance, _Ri_ k Sa _m_ h.\n\np. 84\n\n[paragraph continues] I, 164, 39, 'In which the Vedas are 1, in the\nImperishable one (i. e. Brahman), the highest, the ether (vyoman), on which\nall gods have their seat.' And Taitt. Up. III, 6, 'This is the knowledge of Bh\n_ri_ gu and Varu _n_ a, founded on the highest ether (vyoman).' And again,\n'Om, ka is Brahman, ether (kha) is Brahman' ( _Kh_. Up. IV, 10, 5), and 'the\nold ether' (B _ri_. Up. V, 1) 2. And other similar passages. On account of the\nforce of the complementary passage we are justified in deciding that the word\n'ether,' although occurring in the beginning of the passage, refers to\nBrahman. The case is analogous to that of the sentence, 'Agni (lit. the fire)\nstudies a chapter,' where the word agni, although occurring in the beginning,\nis at once seen to denote a boy 3. It is therefore settled that the word\n'ether' denotes Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[82:1](sbe34028.htm#fr_121) Or else 'that which is within forms and names.'\n\n[84:1](sbe34028.htm#fr_122) Viz. as intimating it.
