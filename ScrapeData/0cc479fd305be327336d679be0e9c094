(Adapted from many sources)\n\nI LOVE to think of those great beings, those royal-hearted Ones, who return to\nearth to shed their divine compassion in order to lift the veil into those\ninner realms of light for those who are ready to look within. Could we not\nrecount among ourselves here tonight some of the strange legendary tales that\nhave been woven about the life of \xc5\x9aankaracharya, who lived from 510 B. C. to\n478 B. C.? For all that mystic lore is a magic tapestry woven of Truth itself.\n\n\n\nHave you ever heard of the portents that attended \xc5\x9aankara\'s birth? It is said\nthat the whole celestial host gave forth paeans of gladness. With no selfish\nor partial joy, but for the sake of religion they rejoiced, because creation,\nengulfed in the ocean of pain, was now to obtain perfect release.\n\n\n\nThe mountains themselves were swayed by the wind of his perfect merit. On\nevery hand the world was greatly shaken, as the wind drives the tossing boat;\nso also the minutest atoms of sandal perfume, and the hidden sweetness of\nprecious lilies floated on the air, and rose through space, and then\ncommingling, came back to earth; so again the garments of Devas descending\nfrom heaven touching the body, caused delightful thrills of joy; the sun and\nmoon with constant course redoubled the brilliancy of their light, whilst in\nthe world the fire\'s gleam of itself prevailed without the\n\np. 156\n\nuse of fuel. Pure water flowed from springs self-caused, and rare and special\nflowers in great abundance bloomed out of season.\n\nAnd more marvelous still, whatever wealth was requisite, there did it appear\nupon earth. From the midst of the pure snowy mountains a wild herd of white\nelephants came of themselves without noise, not curbed by any, self-subdued,\nand every kind of colored horse, in shape and quality surpassingly excellent,\nwith sparkling jewelled manes and flowing tails, came prancing \'round, as if\nwith wings.\n\nAmong men enmity and envy gave way to peace. Content and rest prevailed on\nevery side; whilst there was closer union amongst the true of heart. Discord\nand variance were entirely appeased, and all possessed themselves in harmony.\n\n\n\nWho was this babe that heaven and earth should thus give forth their bounty?\nWere not similar tales told of the childhood of the great Buddha? And have we\nnot also been taught that Buddha and \xc5\x9aankaracharya are most closely connected?\nBoth were Avataras of a high mystical order, though not belonging to the same\nclass of these superior Beings.\n\n\n\nBut to return to the marvelous boy himself. It is said that in his first year\nhe acquired the Sanskrit alphabet and his own language. At the age of two he\nlearned to read. At three he studied the Puranas and understood many portions\nof them by intuition. And in his seventh year, having attained all that his\npreceptor could teach him, he returned home.\n\n\n\nNor was he lacking in occult powers at an early age. Once when his mother lay\nin a swoon, as he stood beside her he drew the river that flowed on the hither\nside of the\n\np. 157\n\nfield up out of its bed, that its pure waters might refresh her.\n\nKings and others of high birth and intellect sought him even at this early age\nthat he might teach them of secret wisdom never uttered except in guarded\nplaces.\n\n\n\nDo you know the tale of how he gained his mother\'s consent to letting him\nbecome a holy ascetic? It runs in this wise: She with her mother\'s pride in\nhis lofty attainments of soul and mind, could not endure the idea that he\nshould shut himself away from the beauties and pleasures of life, and firm was\nshe in her refusal of his request. But the young \xc5\x9aankara could sometimes act\nwith the wile of a young and clever god. So going down to the river one day to\nbathe he soon was alarming his mother by his cries for help. She ran to the\nriver\'s brink and saw that a great alligator held the boy\'s foot in a deadly\ngrip. In helpless agony she stood by the edge of the stream. Then said the\nboy, "The beast has imparted to me that if you will grant my request and let\nme become a holy ascetic, he will loosen his hold." Whereupon the mother gave\nher consent, and the alligator with great tranquillity opened its jaws and\nreleased the youth, who clambered out of the river and lost no time in\npreparing to leave his home, giving over his mother into the care of friends\nand relatives, and telling her he would come back to her whenever she should\nneed his presence.\n\n\n\nThere was living at this time in a cave in the hillside near the Nerbudda,\nRiver a sage, Govind Yati by name. Years ago Vyasa had appeared to him telling\nof the coming of a youth who would demonstrate the most miraculous powers. And\nso it came to pass. When \xc5\x9aankara left his mother he traveled for many days\nthrough forests, over hills, by towns and across rivers, led by an\nirresistible force,\n\np. 158\n\nhe knew not what. After a time he found himself at the opening of the cave in\nthe hillside where dwelt the sage Govind Yati. Straightway he became the pupil\nof the wise man and was taught the four great truths of Brahma, namely:\nKnowledge is Brahma, the soul is Brahma, Thou art That, and I am Brahma. Then\none day as Govind Yati was immersed in contemplation a furious tempest arose.\nViolent thunder shook the heavens, the ethereal vault was riven with tongues\nof lightning; rain deluged the earth, and \xc5\x9aankara, without awaking his master,\nquelled the storm, as quietly as a child is soothed by the sound of sweet\nmusic. And when the sage returned to consciousness and learned of what had\nbefallen, he was filled with great joy and said: "Thus has the prophecy of\nVyasa been fulfilled."\n\n\n\nThen the sage blessed \xc5\x9aankara, and knowing that the youth\'s sojourn with him\nhad come to an end, bestowed his benediction upon him and bade him proceed to\nthe holy city of Benares that he might there receive the blessing of the\nDeity. "Go," said he, "on thy glorious work, then enter, and begin to save\nmankind! "\n\nThus admonished, \xc5\x9aankara turned his steps to Benares, and here it was that he\nreceived his first pupil, Sanandana, the same who afterwards became celebrated\nas his greatest favorite under the title of Padmapada, he for whom the\nenlightened youth reserved his greatest powers of instruction.\n\n\n\nIs there not a tale connected with the acquiring of the name Padmapada by this\ndear pupil?\n\n\n\nThe chroniclers of old tell the story thus: There were among \xc5\x9aankara\'s\ndisciples some within whom envy was aroused at witnessing the unusual\nattachment that existed between the youthful sage and his cherished pupil.\n\xc5\x9aankara wished to dispel these envious feelings and show them\n\np. 159\n\nthat it was through superior merit alone that Sanandana was chosen among them\nfor higher instruction and closer communion with the Teacher. So standing one\nday on the banks of the river which ran near his dwelling-place, he called to\nSanandana who stood on the other side among his companions, to come over to\nhim directly. Sanandana forthwith without any hesitation and with dauntless\nspirit stepped upon the flowing waters of the river and moved towards his\nTeacher with stedfast and graceful mien. And lo! At each step a lovely lotus\nsprang from the bosom of the waters, trailing a starry line of blossoms behind\nhim as he stepped lightly upon the bank. Then said \xc5\x9aankaracharya, as he\nembraced Sanandana: "Henceforth shall you be known among us as Padmapada, \'He\nof the Lotus-path.\'"\n\n\n\nBut tarry a moment. Have we not run ahead of our story? It was many years ere\nthis, indeed when he was but twelve years of age that he made his dwelling\nupon the banks of the Ganges and there wrote the great works that men who seek\nwisdom have studied ever since: his Commentaries on the Sutras, the\nUpanishads, and on the _Bhagavad-G ita_. In later years when Padmapada came to\nhim bewailing the loss of one of his precious Commentaries which as it chanced\nhad been destroyed by his uncle, \xc5\x9aankara without any perturbation recited the\ncontents of that which had been destroyed in the exact words familiar to all\nhis pupils while Padmapada rewrote them as he spoke.\n\n\n\nNor did such feats as this mark the limit of his mental powers. He was so wise\nand so well versed in the vast learning of the Vedas, that his name was\nsounded as victor in all philosophical discussions and debates. Once he went\nto the city of Mahishmati where dwelt the sage Mandana Misra. He was led\ntowards the house of this wise man by a\n\np. 160\n\nnumber of parrots miraculously endowed with human speech, who, so the story\nruns, discoursed upon weighty philosophical questions. But when he reached the\ndoor of the dwelling he found it fast shut. Undismayed he arose in the air and\nentered from above, alighting just beside Mandana Misra in his spacious hall.\nThen began an animated discussion between the astonished host and his\nunexpected guest. The sun rose high in the heavens and found them deep in\ntheir debate; it sloped down the sky in its westering course and yet the two,\neach of redoubtable intellect, continued. At length as evening crept upon them\nthey called on the wife of Mandana Misra to act as umpire between them; but\nshe, busy housewife that she was, deemed it not thrifty to let the hours pass\nattending to the discourse of word-spinners, so with ready wit she brought two\ngarlands of fresh flowers saying: "Wear these as you talk, and he whose\ngarland does not wither shall be deemed victor." So the two each put on his\ngarland and in no long time Mandana Misra\'s was limp and faded like the leaves\nof a delicate tree beneath the rays of the summer sun. But \xc5\x9aankara\'s remained\nfresh as when first brought in at dewy eve.\n\n\n\nAnd that is but the beginning of the story, for the victor claimed his\nopponent as a disciple. And the wife--she we learn was none other than\nSarasvati in corporeal form. Nor would \xc5\x9aankaracharya be content until he had\nheld debate with her. Many were the questions put to him by his fair\nadversary, but always was he to the fore with a ready answer. Then Sarasvati,\nfor so we may now call her, turned into a path of thought to which \xc5\x9aankara was\nan utter stranger. She asked him a question on the science of love! For the\nfirst time no answer was forthcoming, yet even such a question must be solved\nby the sage. So he left Mandana Misra\'s\n\np. 161\n\ncity in search of an answer. He traveled for some time with his disciples and\ncame at length to a forest.\n\nNow it so happened that a certain king named Amaraka lay dying here at the\nfoot of a tree surrounded by many friends mourning his departure. As the soul\nof the dying man took flight an unusual thing happened. \xc5\x9aankara left his own\nbody, entrusting it to the care of his disciples. He entered that of the dead\nking, and the monarch\'s followers, seeing their chief rise once again with the\nlight of life in his eyes, were overjoyed beyond words, and went out of the\nforest of death back to the throne of royalty.\n\nThere king \xc5\x9aankara, standing as it were in the shoes of Amaraka, and indeed\nAmaraka himself as far as the eye could discern, learned all that pertained to\nthe science and art of love, and so fitted himself to answer the probing\nquestions of Sarasvati. Meanwhile, however, the Ministers of State, finding\ntheir resuscitated rajan a far wiser and better man than ever before,\nsuspected that there had been some such change of souls as we have described,\nThey were loth to part with their new and wonderful king, so they issued a\ndecree that the bodies of all those who had just passed on into the inner\nrealms should be burnt. They hoped thereby that the mortal frame of this\nstrange and beautiful being, now deserted, would be destroyed with the rest,\nand that thus he would remain a captive within the body of their king.\n\n\n\nTime sped on, and Padmapada and the other devoted disciples, knowing not of\nthe decree of the Ministers of State, left the body of their beloved master\nentrusted to their care, and journeyed towards the king\'s city. "Let us," said\nPadmapada, "appear before the king as singers, and weaving a message around\nour sweet music, let us tell him how we long for his return." It all came to\npass as they had\n\np. 162\n\nplanned; for as they stood before the supposed King Amaraka in the great hall\nof the palace, not only were those who listened spellbound by their marvelous\nmusic, but its pellucid strains stole into the inner consciousness of\n\xc5\x9aankaracharya. Before the bewildered attendants knew what had befallen,\n\xc5\x9aankaracharya gratefully dismissed the singers and released himself from the\ncorporeal chains that bound him. His own body he found already upon the\nfuneral pyre surrounded by angry flames that seemed to reach to the very\nheavens. But it remained untouched by their destructive power, and entering\nit, \xc5\x9aankara, shining with the illumination which streamed from his own being,\ndescended from the pyre and rejoined his devoted pupils, and together they\nmade their way to the house of Mandana Misra, who became a disciple of the\nyoung sage after hearing the last question of Sarasvati answered with keen wit\nand wisdom.\n\n\n\nFrom this time on the beautiful messenger of the gods, for such in truth he\nwas, journeyed from city to city with his faithful followers, spreading\nwherever he went his teachings of the Vedanta. It was indeed a spiritual and\nintellectual conquest. His words among the populace, in the great cities or\namong the smaller towns and hamlets, in the forests or along the highways,\nwere like the falling of the gentle rain after a season of drought and famine.\nHis presence was like the glory of the morning sunlight when the curtains of\nmist roll away from before the face of the sun.\n\n\n\nMany are the stories told of his godlike powers, but were we to recount these\ntonight, dawn would find us still gathered here telling tales--tales of his\nbringing back to earth the spirit of one departing, of his power to produce\nfire from the palm of his right band, of his ability to send his consciousness\n\np. 163\n\nwhithersoever he willed. Those who are ignorant call these wonder-works\nmiracles. Those who have knowledge of things behind this veil of illusion\nabout us, know \xc5\x9aankara to be the greatest Initiate living in historical ages;\nand to the Initiate Nature makes obeisance, laying at his feet the key to her\ninnermost secrets.\n\n\n\nYou have heard the words of one of the Wise Ones of the earth: "A few drops of\nrain do not make the monsoon, though they presage it." Thus does\n\xc5\x9aankaracharya, unlike the ordinary mortal, perfected in wisdom, master of rare\nand occult powers, in appearance even like a god, stand as a prophecy of what\nwe shall one day become in the far aeons of the future, yea, in that far\ndistant time when the human host shall have made its long, long journey again\nand yet again through the seven spheres of its present home.\n\n\n\nUntil his thirty-second year this Sage of the East journeyed, carrying from\nland to land the blessing of his divine philosophy. Then his term of life was\nat an end, and into those heavenly realms where in joy the gods awaited him he\ndisappeared in this wise: he absorbed his gross body into the subtil one and\nbecame existent; then destroying the subtil one into the body which is the\ncause of the world, he became pure intelligence; then attaining in the world\nof the \xc3\x8e\xc5\x9bvara full happiness, unbroken, like a perfect circle, be became the\nintelligence which pervades the whole universe. Even now does he exist as the\nall-pervading intelligence. From above rang the grand paean of the gods\nechoing within the sacred places of the earth: "Victory!"\n\n'
