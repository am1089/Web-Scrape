After having eaten sesamum or having fasted on the full moon day of the\nmonth Srava _n_ a July-August), he may on the following day bathe in the water\nof a great river and offer (a burnt-oblation of) one thousand pieces of sacred\nfuel, whilst. reciting the Gayatri, or he may mutter (the Gayatri) as many\ntimes. 1\n\n2\\. Or he may perform Ish _t_ is and Soma-sacrifices for the sake of purifying\nhimself (from his sins), 2\n\n3\\. After having eaten forbidden food, he must fast, until his entrails are\nempty. 3\n\n4\\. That is (generally) attained after seven days.\n\n5\\. Or he may during winter and during the dewy\n\np. 87\n\nseason (November-March) bathe in cold water both morning and evening.\n\n6\\. Or he may perform a K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance, which lasts twelve days.\n\n7\\. The rule for the K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance of twelve days (is the\nfollowing): For three days he must not eat in the evening, and then for three\ndays not in the morning; for three days he must live on food which has been\ngiven unasked, and three days he must not eat anything. 7\n\n8\\. If he repeats this for a year, that is called a K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra\npenance, which lasts for a year.\n\n9\\. Now follows another penance. He who has committed even a great many sins\nwhich do not cause him to fall, becomes free from guilt, if, fasting, he\nrecites the entire _S_ akha of his Veda three times consecutively. 9\n\n10\\. He who cohabits with a non-Aryan woman, he who lends money at interest,\nhe who drinks (other) spirituous liquors (than Sura), he who praises everybody\nin a manner unworthy of a Brahma _n_ a, shall sit on grass, allowing his back\nto be scorched (by the sun).\n\n11\\. A Brahma _n_ a removes the sin which he committed by serving one day and\nnight (a man of) the black race, if he bathes for three years, eating at every\nfourth meal-time. 11\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[86:1](sbe0230.htm#fr_485) **27**. 'The oblations of sacred fuel (samidh) are\nnot to be accompanied by the exclamation Svaha'--Haradatta.\n\n[86:2](sbe0230.htm#fr_486) Ish _t_ is are the simplest forms of the _S_ rauta-\nsacrifices, i.e. of those for which three fires are necessary.\n\n[86:3](sbe0230.htm#fr_487) For some particular kinds of forbidden food the\nsame penance is prescribed, Manu XI, 153-154.\n\n[87:7](sbe0230.htm#fr_488) The same penance is described, under the name Pra\n_g_ apatya k _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra, the K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra invented by Pra _g_\napati, Manu XI, 212, and Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. III, 320.\n\n[87:9](sbe0230.htm#fr_489) Manu XI, 259.\n\n[87:11](sbe0230.htm#fr_490) The expression k _ri_ sh _n_ a var _n_ a, 'the\nblack race,' is truly Vedic. In the _Ri_ _g_ -veda it usually denotes the\naboriginal races, and sometimes the demons. Others explain the Sutra thus: p.\n88 A Brahma _n_ a removes the sin, which he committed by cohabiting for one\nnight with a female of the _S_ udra caste, &c.--Haradatta. The latter\nexplanation has been adopted by Kulluka on Manu XI. 179.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Pa _t_ ala 10, Kha _n_ _d_ a 28](sbe0231.htm)\n\n"
