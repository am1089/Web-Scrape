III.\n\nBirth of Krishn\xcc\x81a: conveyed by Vasudeva to Mathura, and exchanged with the\nnew-born daughter of Ya\xc5\x9boda. Kansa attempts to destroy the latter, who becomes\nYoganidra.\n\nTHUS eulogized by the gods, Devaki bore in her womb the lotus-eyed deity, the\nprotector of the world. The sun of Achyuta rose in the dawn of Devaki to cause\nthe lotus petal of the universe to expand. On the day of his birth the\nquarters of the horizon were irradiate with joy, as if moonlight was diffused\nover the whole earth. The virtuous experienced new delight, the strong winds\nwere hushed, and the rivers glided tranquilly, when Janarddana was about to be\nborn. The seas with their own melodious murmurings made the music, whilst the\nspirits and the nymphs of heaven danced and sang: the gods, walking the sky,\nshowered down flowers upon the earth, and the holy fires glowed with a mild\nand gentle flame. At midnight, when the supporter of all was about to be born,\nthe clouds emitted low pleasing sounds, and poured down rain of flowers.\n\nAs soon as \xc3\x81nakadundubhi beheld the child, of the complexion of the lotus\nleaves, having four arms, and the mystic mark \xc5\x9arivatsa on his breast, he\naddressed him in terms of love and reverence, and represented the fears he\nentertained of Kansa. "Thou art born," said Vasudeva, "O sovereign god of\ngods, bearer of the shell, the discus, and the mace; but now in mercy withhold\nthis thy celestial form, for Kansa will assuredly put me to death when he\nknows that thou hast descended in my dwelling." Devaki also exclaimed, "God of\ngods, who art all things, who comprisest all the regions of the world in thy\nperson, and who by thine illusion hast assumed the condition of an infant,\nhave compassion upon us, and forego this thy four-armed shape, nor let Kansa,\nthe impious son of Diti, know of thy descent."\n\nTo these applications Bhagavat answered and said, "Princess, in former times I\nwas prayed to by thee and adored in the hope of progeny: thy prayers have been\ngranted, for I am born thy son." So saying, he was silent: and Vasudeva,\ntaking the babe, went out that same night; for the guards were all charmed by\nYoganidra, as were the warders at\n\np. 503\n\nthe gates of Mathura, and they obstructed not the passage of \xc3\x81nakadundubhi. To\nprotect the infant from the heavy rain that fell from the clouds of night,\n\xc5\x9aesha, the many-headed serpent, followed Vasudeva, and spread his hoods above\ntheir heads; and when the prince, with the child in his arms, crossed the\nYamuna river, deep as it was, and dangerous with numerous whirlpools, the\nwaters were stilled, and rose not above his knee.. On the bank he saw Nanda\nand the rest, who had come thither to bring tribute due to Kansa; but they\nbeheld him not 1. At the same time Ya\xc5\x9boda was also under the influence of\nYoganidra, whom she had brought forth as her daughter, and whom the prudent\nVasudeva took up, placing his son in her place by the side of the mother: he\nthen quickly returned home. When Ya\xc5\x9boda awoke, she found that she had been\ndelivered of a boy, as black as the dark leaves of the lotus, and she was\ngreatly rejoiced.\n\nVasudeva, bearing off the female infant of Ya\xc5\x9boda, reached his mansion\nunobserved, and entered and placed the child in the bed of Devaki: he then\nremained as usual. The guards were awakened by the cry of the new-born babe,\nand, starting up, they sent word to Kansa that Devaki had borne a child. Kansa\nimmediately repaired to the residence of Vasudeva, where he seized upon the\ninfant. In vain Devaki convulsively entreated him to relinquish the child: he\nthrew it ruthlessly against a stone; but it rose into the sky, and expanded\ninto a gigantic figure, having eight arms, each wielding some formidable\nweapon. This terrific being laughed aloud, and said to Kansa, "What avails it\nthee, Kansa, to have hurled me to the ground? he is born who shall kill thee,\nthe mighty one amongst the gods, who was formerly thy destroyer. Now quickly\nsecure him, and provide for thine own welfare." Thus having spoken, the\ngoddess, decorated with heavenly perfumes and garlands, and hymned by the\nspirits of the air, vanished from before the eyes of Bhoja raja 2.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[503:1](vp120.htm#fr_1465) The Bhagavata more consistently makes Vasudeva find\nNanda and the rest fast asleep in their houses, and subsequently describes\ntheir bringing tribute or tax (kara) to Kansa.\n\n[503:2](vp120.htm#fr_1466) Chief of the tribe of Bhoja, a branch of the\nYadavas: see [p. 424](vp106.htm#page_424).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter IV](vp121.htm)\n\n'
