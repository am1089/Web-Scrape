The Himalayas said:--"O on this earth that are prominent, sacred, and\nworth visiting and which Thou likest best. O Mother! Also sanctify us by\ndescribing the vows and utsabs that are pleasing to Thee, and by performing\nwhich, men become blessed and get themselves satisfied.\n\n3-10. The Devi spoke:--"O Himavan! All the places that are on this earth are\nall Mine and all should be visited. And every moment is fit for taking vows\nand utsabs. For I am of the nature pervading every moment; so whatever actions\nare performed at any moment are all equal to taking My vows and utsabs. O King\nof Mountains! Still I am now telling something out of My affection to My\nBhakta _s_. Hear. There is a great place of pilgrimage named Kolhapura in the\nsouthern country. Here the Devi Lak _s_ mi always dwells. The second place is\nMatripura in the Sahyadri mountain; here the Devi Re _n_ uka dwells. The third\nplace is Tulajapur; next is the place Saptas\'ringa, the great places of\nHingula and Jvala Mukhi. Then the great places of Sakambhari, Bhramari,\nS\'riraktadantika and Durga. The best of all places is that of Vindhyachala\nVasini, the great places of Annapurna and the excellent Kanchipur\n(Conjiverum). Next come the placesof Bhima Devi, Vimala Devi, S\'ri Cha _n_\ndrala Devi of Kar _n_ a _t_ , andthe place of Kaus\'iki. Then the great placeof\nNilamba on the top of the Nilaparvata, the place of Jambunades\'vari, and the\nbeautiful S\'rinagara.\n\n11-20. The great place of S\'ri Guhya Kali, well established in Nepal, and that\nof S\'ri Minak _s_ i Devi established in Chidamvaram. The great\n\np. 732\n\nplace named Vedara _n_ ya where the Sundari Devi is residing; then the place\nnamed Ekamvaram, and the place Bhuvanes\'vara near Puru _s_ ottama where I\nalways dwell as Para S\'akti Bhuva _n_ es\'vari. The famous place of Mahalasa,\nknown in the south by the name Mallari; the place of Yoges\'vari Vara _t_ , and\nthe widely known place of Nila S\'arasvati in China. The excellent place of\nBagala in Baidyanath, the supreme place Ma _n_ idvipa of S\'rimati\nBhuvanes\'vari where I always reside. The Yonima _nd_ ala Kamakhya, the place\nof S\'rimati Tripura Bhariavi, the excellent of all the places in this earth,\nwhere the Devi Maha Maya always dwells. There is no other place better than\nthis on the earth. Here the Devi becomes every month in Her course of\nmenstruation and where the virtuous men are seen. Here all the Devas remain in\nthe form of mountains and where on the mountains the excellent Devas inhabit.\nThe sages say: That all the places there are of the nature of the Devi; there\nis no better place than this Kamakhya Yonimai _nd_ ala. Pu _s_ kara, the\nsacred place, is the seat of Gayatri; the place of Cha _nd_ ika in Amares\'a:\nand the excellent place of Pu _s_ karek _s_ i _n_ i in Frabhasa. The place of\nLinga-dhari _n_ i Devi in Naimi _s_ ara _ny_ a, and the place of Purubuta in\nPu _s_ karak _s_ a; Rati dwells in \xc3\x82sa _d_ hi.\n\n21-30. Da _nd_ ini Parames\'vari dwells in Cha _nd_ amun _d_ i. Bhuti dwells in\nBharabhuti; and Nakule S\'vari dwells in Nakula. Chandrika dwells in\nHaris\'chandra; S\'ankari in S\'rigiri; Tris\'ula in Japes\'vara; and Suk _s_ ma in\n\xc3\x82mrata Kes\'vara. S\'ankari dwells in Ujjain, S\'arva _n_ i in the place\nMadhyama, and Marga Dayini dwells in the holy K _s_ etra Kedara. The\ncelebrated Bhairavi dwells in the place named Bhairava; Mangala in Gaya K _s_\nettra; Sthanupriya in Kuruk _s_ etra; and Svayambhuvi Devi dwells in Nakula;\nUgra dwells in Kankhal; Vis\'vesa dwells in Vimales\'vara, Mahananda in Attahasa\nand Mahantaka in Mahendra. Bhimes\'vari dwells in Bhima; the Bhavani S\'ankari\ndwells in Vastrapadma; and Rudra _n_ i in Ardha Ko _t_ i. Vis\'alak _s_ i\ndwells in Avimukta; Mahabhaga dwells in Mahalaya; Bhadrakar _n_ i in Gokar _n_\na; and Bhadra resides in Bhadrakar _n_ ak; Utpalak _s_ i dwells in Suvarnak\n_s_ a; Stha _n_ vis\'a in Stha _n_ u; Kamala in Kamalalaya; Cha _nd_ a in\nChhagala _nd_ aka, situated in the south near the seacoast. Trisandhya dwells\nin Kuru _nd_ ala; Muku _t_ es\'vari in Mako _t_ a; S\'an _d_ aki in Mandales\'a;\nKali in Kalanjara; Dhvani in S\'ankukar _n_ a; Sthula in Sthulakes\'vara; and\nParames\'vari Hrillekha dwells in the heart lotuses of the J\xc3\xb1anins.\n\n31-34. The places mentioned above are all dearest to the Devi. First the\nmerits of these places are to be heard; next the Devi is to be\n\np. 733\n\nworshipped by the rites and ceremonies according to these rules. Or, O\nMountain! All the holy places of pilgrimages exist in Kas\'i. The Devi always\ndwells there. Persons, devoted to the Devi, see these places and if they make\nJapam and meditate on the lotus-feet of the Devi, they will certainly be freed\nfrom the bondi of Samsara; there is no doubt in this. If anybody, getting up\nin the morning, recite the names of these places, all his sins would instantly\nbe burnt away.\n\n35-40. And if one reads, in the time of S\'raddha, before the Brahmi _n_ s,\nthese holy names of the Devi, his Pitris will be purified of their sins in the\nMahakas\'a by the Maha Pra _n_ a and will get their highest goal. O One of good\nvows! I will now describe to you the vows that are to be carefully observed by\nmen and women; hear. Ananta Tritiyakhys Vrata (vow), Rasakalyani Vrata, and\n\xc3\x82rdranandakara Vrata, these three Vratas are to be observed in the Tritiya\n(third) tithi. The next come the Friday vow, the Kri _sn_ a Chaturdas\'i vows,\nthe Tuesday vow, and the evening twilight vow. In this twilight vow, Maha Deva\nplaced the Devi in the evening on an \xc3\x82sana; and He, along with the other\nDevas, began to dance before Her. Fasting is enjoined in this vow; and then in\nthe evening one must worship the Devi, the Giver of all auspicious things.\nEspecially in every fortnight, if the Devi be worshipped, She gets extremely\npleased.\n\n41\\. O Best of Mountains! The Monday vow is very agreeable to Me; the worship\nof the Devi should be done and then in the night one must take one\'s food,\n\n42-43. The two nine nights vow called Navaratra are to be observed, one in the\nautumn and the other in the spring season. These are very dear to Me. He is\ncertainly My devotee and very dear who for My satisfaction performs these and\nthe othar Nitya Naimittik vows, free from any pride and jealousy. He certainly\ngets the Sajujya Mukti with Me.\n\n44-46. O Nagaraja! The Holy (Dol) festival in the month of Chait on tha third\nday of the white fortnight is very pleasing to Me and should be observed by\nall. My devotees perform the S\'ayanotsava in the Paur _n_ amasi in the month\nof \xc3\x82sa _d_ ha; the Jagara _n_ otsava in the Paur _n_ amasi in the month of\nKartik, the Ratha Jatra in the 3rd of the white fortnight in \xc3\x82sa _d_ ha; the\nDamanotsava in Chaitra. And my dear festivals in the month of S\'ravana and\nvarious other festivals.\n\np. 734\n\n47-49. In all these festivals one should feast well with gladness all My\ndevotees, and the Kumaris (virgins), well clothed and dressed, and the boys,\nthinking them all to be of My very nature. No miserliness is to be entertained\nand I should be worshipped with flowers, etc. He is blessed and attains his\ngoal and is dear to Me who carefully and devotedly observes overy year all\nthese festivals. O Nagendra! Thus I have described to you in brief all the\nvows that are pleasing to Me. These instructions are not to be given who is\nnot a disciple nor to one who is not My devotee.\n\nHere ends the Thirty-eighth Chapter of the Seventh Book on the vows and the\nsacred places of the Devi in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, of\n18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXXIX: The Worship of the World Mother](dg09.htm)\n\n'
