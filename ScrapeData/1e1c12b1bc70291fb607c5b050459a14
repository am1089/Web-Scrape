The Ri _s_ is said :-- \xc2\x93O Sinless Suta! You have described to us in\ndetail **** the birth of Vyasa, of unrivalled fire, and of Satyavati; but we\nhave one great doubt in our minds though, O Knower of Dharma! which is not\nbeing removed by your words. O Sinless one! First, as regards the mother of\nVyasa, the all auspicious Satyavati, we have this doubt how she came to be\nunited to the virtuous S\xc2\x92antanu? The king S\xc2\x92antanu, of the family of Puru is a\ngreatly religious man; how could he have married Satyavati **** knowing her to\nbe a fisherman's daughter and born of a low family? Now say who was the first\nwife __ of S\xc2\x92antanu and how Bhisma, the intelligent son of S\xc2\x92antanu came to be\nborn of the parts of Vasu? O Suta! You have told before that Bhisma, of\nindomitable valour, made the Satyavati's son, the brave Chitrangada, king; and\nsubsequent to his death made his younger brother Vichitravirya king. But when\nthe elder brother Bhisma, the greatly religious and beautiful was present, how\nwas it that Chitrangada and Vichitravirya **** having been installed by Bhisma\nhimself could have reigned.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n9-12. Again on the demise of Vichitravirya, **** Satyavati **** became very __\nmuch grieved and got two sons born of her two son's wives by Vedavyasa? How\ncan we explain this fact? Why did she do this? Why did she not give to Bhisma\nthe kingdom? Why did Bhisma not marry? And how was it that the elder brother\nVyasa Deva, of indomitable valour, did such an irreligious act as to beget two\n(Goloka) sons from the wives of the brothers? Vyasa composed the Pura _n_ as\nand knew everything of religion; how then did he go to other's wives,\nespecially, of his brother's wives?\n\n\n\n13-14. O Suta! Why did Vyasa Deva do such a hateful act, in spite of his being\na Muni? The actions of Vedas are inferred from their subsequent good conducts;\nhow can this act of Vyasa be calculated as one amongst them? O Intelligent\none! You are the disciple of Vyasa; therefore you are the best man to solve\nour doubts. We all of this Dharmakshettra **** Naimi _s_ ara _n_ ya **** are\nvery eager to hear this.\n\n\n\n15-39. At this Suta said :-- In ancient days there reigned a king named\nMahabhi _s_ a **,** in the family of Ik _s_ aku endowed with all the qualities\nof a great king; he was the foremost of all the kings, truthful and religious.\nThat highly intelligent king performed thousand **** horse-sacrifices (Asva\n\n\n\np. 85\n\n** **\n\nmedhas) **** one hundred Vajapeya **** sacrifices and thereby satisfied Indra,\nthe king of the Devas **** and went to Heavens. Once, on an occasion, that\nking went to the abode of Brahma; the other gods also went there to serve\nPrajapati. **** The great river, Ganga Devi, too, assuming the feminine form,\nwent to Brahma to serve him. Now, in the interval, violent winds arose and the\nclothing of Ganga Devi went off; at this the Devas did not look at her; rather\nkept their faces downwards; but the king Mahabhi _s_ a continued gazing at\nher. Ganga also came to know the king and that he had become attached to her.\nBrahma, seeing that both of them are love-stricken and are shameless, became\nangry and cursed them immediately :-- O king! you better take your birth again\nin the human world and practise great meritorious deeds and come again to this\nHeaven. Thus saying, Brahma looked at Ganga, who was attached to the king, and\naddressed her :-- \xc2\x93You too better go to the human world and become his wife.\xc2\x94\nBoth of them, the king as well as Ganga, came out of Brahma's abode, very much\ngrieved in their hearts. The king Mahabhi _s_ a thought of coming to this\nworld and reflected on the kings thereof and settled to make **** the king\nPratipa of Puru's family his father. At this time the eight Vasus with their\nwives wandering in various places and enjoying **** as they **** liked came to\nthe hermitage of Vas'i _st_ ha. **** Amongst the aforesaid **** eight Vasus\nPrithu and others, one Vasu Dyau's wife seeing Nandini, the sacrificial cow\n(Kamadhenu) **** of Vas'i _st_ ha asked her husband :-- \xc2\x93Whose is this\nexcellent cow that I see? Vasu then replied as follows :-- \xc2\x93 O Beautiful ****\none! This is Vas'i _st_ ha's **** cow. Whoever, be he a man or woman drinks\n**** her milk gets his longevity extended to ten thousand years and his youth\nnever ends.\xc2\x94 Hearing this, the Vasu's wife said :-- \xc2\x93There is a very ****\nbeautiful comrade (Sakhi) of mine, the daughter of the Rajarsi-Us'ina in the\nworld, of auspicious qualities. O Mahabhaga! Kindly bring to me from Vas'i\n_st_ ha's hermitage that auspicious sacrificial milch cow Nandini together\nwith her calf that yields all desires; my Sakhi will then **** drink her milk\nand be thereby **** free from disease, old age and become the chief amongst\nall mankind. **** Hearing **** thus, his wife's word, the Vasu **** Dyau,\nthough sinless, stole away **** together with Prithu and the other Vasus the\ncow Nandini in utter defiance to the self-controlled Muni Vas'i _st_ ha. When\nthe cow Nandini had been stolen, the great ascetic Vas'is _t_ ha came quickly\nto the hermitage with **a** bundance **** of fruits.\n\n\n\nThe ascetic Muni Vas'i _st_ ha, **** not finding, in his hermitage, his cow\nwith her calf, searched for her in many forests and caves; but he, the son of\nVaru _n_ a, **** could not find out his cow even **** after prolonged\nsearches; he, then, took recourse to meditation **** and came to know ****\nthat the Vasus had **** stolen the cow and became angry. He expressed :--\n\xc2\x93When the Vasus have **** stolen this my cow in utter defiance to my self,\nthey must be born\n\n\n\np. 86 ****\n\n** **\n\namongst men.\xc2\x94 When the religious Varu _n_ a's son Vas'i _st_ ha thus cursed\nthe Vasus, they __ became very sorry and absent-minded; all of them went to\nVas'i _st_ ha's hermitage and saw him there; they began to supplicate him as\nmuch as they could; and took refuge under him. Seeing the Vasus standing\nbefore him in an extremely distressed condition, the virtuous Muni Vas'i _st_\nha said :-- \xc2\x93You all will be free from the curse within one year; but the Vasu\nDyau will dwell amongst men for a long, long period as he had stolen direct my\nNandini with her calf.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n40-60. While the Vasus, thus cursed, were returning, they saw on the way the\nchief river Ganga Devi also cursed and therefore distressed; all of them bowed\ndown to her simultaneously and said: \xc2\x93O Devi! A serious thought is troubling\nour minds, how can we, who live on nectar, take our birth in human wombs; so,\nO best river! You better be a woman and give birth to us. O Sinless one! You\nbetter be the wife of the sage King S\xc2\x92antanu and no sooner we be born of your\nwomb, kindly throw us in the river Ganga (your water). If you do thus, O Ganga\nwe will certainly be freed of our curse.\xc2\x94 Ganga Devi replied \xc2\x93Well; that will\nbe.\xc2\x94 Thus spoken, the Vasus went to their respective places; and Ganga Devi,\ntoo, thinking on the subject again and again, went out of that place. At this\ntime Mahabhi _s_ a became born as a son of the king Pratipa and became known\nas S\xc2\x92antanu. He was exceedingly religious and true to his promise. One day __\nwhile the King Pratipa was praising the Surya Devi (the sun) of unequalled\nenergy, Ganga Devi assumed an extraordinarily beautiful feminine form and came\nout of the waters and sat on the right thigh, resembling like a sal tree, of\nthe king Pratipa. The sage king Pratip spoke out to the lady sitting on his\nright thigh, thus :-- \xc2\x93O beautiful faced one! Why, unasked, have you sat on my\nauspicious right thigh?\xc2\x94 The lovely Ganga then replied :-- \xc2\x93Hear why I have\nsat here. O best of Kurus! O king! Becoming attached to you, I have sat on\nyour thigh; so please accept me.\xc2\x94 At this the king Pratipa spoke to the\nbeautiful lady, full of youth and beauty, \xc2\x93I never go, simply out of passion\nto another's wife. There is another point; you have sat on my right thigh;\nthat is the seat of sons and son's wives; so, when my desired son will be\nborn, you will then, be my son's wife. And certainly, by your good will, my\nson will be born.\xc2\x94 The lady, of divine form, said, Well; that will be done!\nand went away. The king returned to his palace, thinking of the lady. After\nsome time, he had **a** son born to him and when the son attained his teens,\nthe king desired to lead a forest life and communicated this matter to his\nson. He said also, if the aforesaid beautifully smiling girl comes to you to\nmarry, then marry her. And I am also ordering you not to question her anything\n\xc2\x93who are you\xc2\x94 and so forth. If you take her as your legal wife, you will\ncertainly be happy. Thus\n\n\n\np. 87\n\n\n\nsaying to his son, the king Pratipa handed over all his kingdom to his son and\ngladly retired into the forest. The king practised tapasya in the forest and\n**** worshipped Ambika; on quitting his mortal coil, he went by his sheer\nmerit to the Heavens **.** The **** highly **** energetic king S\xc2\x92antanu, on\ngetting his kingdom, began to administer justice according to the laws of\nDharma and governed his subjects.\n\n\n\nThus ends the third Chapter of the Second Skandha **** on the description of\nthe curse on Ganga, Mahabhi _s_ a **** and Vasus in the **** Mahapura _n_ am\n**** S **\xc2\x92** ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam **** of 18,000 verses.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 4](bk02ch04.htm)\n\n"
