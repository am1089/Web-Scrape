Now, therefore, I will proclaim by what rites, connected with the Saman,\nRik, Ya _g_ us, and Atharva-vedas, 1\n\np. 323\n\n[paragraph continues] (man) quickly attains the wishes of his heart.\n\n2\\. Having purified his body by muttered prayers, burnt oblations, Ish _t_ is,\nrestraints, and the like, he will accomplish all his objects. He will not\nattain success in any other way.\n\n3\\. A Brahma _n_ a, who is going to mutter prayers, to offer burnt oblations\nor Ish _t_ is, or to practise restraints, shall, first, during the bright half\nof the month, on a lucky day and under a lucky constellation, cause his hair\nand beard to be cut. 3\n\n4\\. Let him bathe in the morning, at noon, and in the evening; let him beware\nof anger and untruth; let him not address women and _S_ udras; let him be\ncontinent, and subsist solely on food fit for offerings.\n\n5\\. Avoiding to sleep in the day-time, let him worship cows, Brahma _n_ as,\nmanes, and gods. As long as he is engaged in muttering prayers, offering Homas\nand Ish _t_ is, and practising restraints, let him stand during the day and\nsit during the night.\n\n6\\. The K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra (penance) revealed by Pra _g_ apati lasts twelve\ndays, (which are divided into four separate) periods of three days; (during\nthe first period of three days he eats) in the day-time (only, during the\nsecond) at night (only, during the third he subsists on) food given without\nasking, (and during the fourth) finally (he lives on) air. 6\n\np. 324\n\n7\\. (If one eats on) one (day in) the morning (only), and (on the following\nday) at night (only, on the next day food) given without asking, (and on the\nfourth day) subsists on air, and repeats this three times, that is called the\nK _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra (penance) of children. 7\n\n8\\. (If) one eats one mouthful only at each (meal), following, during (three)\nperiods of three days, the rules given above, and subsists during another\nperiod of three days on air, that is called the Atik _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance.\n8\n\n9\\. (If) during those (first) three periods of three days one partakes of\nwater only, and subsists afterwards (during three days) on air, that third\n(variety) must be known to be the most efficacious K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ratik _ri_\n_k_ _kh_ ra penance. 9\n\n10\\. If one drinks hot milk, (hot) clarified butter, (and a hot) decoction of\nKu _s_ a grass, each during three days, and fasts during another three days,\nthat is called the Taptak _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra. 10\n\n11\\. (If one lives during one day) on cow\'s urine, (during one day) on\ncowdung, (during one day) on milk, (during one day) on sour milk, (during one\nday) on clarified butter, (during one day) on a decoction of Ku _s_ a grass,\nand during one (day and) night on air, that is called the Sa _m_ tapana K _ri_\n_k_ _kh_ ra. 11\n\n12\\. Let him take the cow\'s urine, reciting the Gayatri; the cowdung,\n(reciting the text), \'Gandhadvaram;\' 12\n\np. 325\n\nthe milk, (reciting the verse), \'\xc3\x82pyayasva;\' the sour milk, reciting (the\nverse), \'Dadhikrav _n_ a;\' the clarified butter, (saying), \' _S_ ukram asi;\'\nthe decoction of Ku _s_ a grass (with the text), \'Devasya tva;\'\n\n13\\. (And mix together) one part of cow\'s urine, half as much .cowdung, three\nparts of milk, two of sour milk, one part of clarified butter, and one part of\nwater boiled with Ku _s_ a grass;\' a Sa _m_ tapana K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra\n(performed) in this manner will purify even a _S_ vapaka. 13\n\n14\\. He who subsists during five (days and) nights on cow\'s urine, cowdung,\nmilk, sour milk, and clarified butter will be purified by (that) Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_\nagavya (the five products of the cow). 14\n\n15\\. If, self-restrained and attentive, he fasts during twelve days, that is\ncalled a Paraka K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra, which destroys all sin. 15\n\n16\\. If he subsists on cow\'s urine and the other (substances named above), one\nday on each, and continues (this mode of life) during thrice seven days, the\ntheologians call that a Mahasa _m_ tapana K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra. 16\n\n17\\. If he daily adds to his food one mouthful during the bright (half of the\nmonth) and diminishes it daily by one mouthful during the dark (half of the\nmonth), and keeps two fasts in the two halves of the month, that is called a\n_K_ andraya _n_ a. 17\n\n18\\. If, with concentrated mind, a Brahma _n_ a eats four mouthfuls in the\nmorning and four mouthfuls when the sun has set, he will perform the _K_\nandraya _n_ a of children. 18\n\np. 326\n\n19\\. If, self-restrained, he daily eats, during a month, at midday eight\nmouthfuls of food, fit for a sacrifice, he will perform the _K_ andraya _n_ a\nof ascetics. 19\n\n20\\. But a Brahma _n_ a who eats anyhow, during a month, thrice eighty\nmouthfuls of food, fit for a sacrifice, goes to the world of the moon. 20\n\n21\\. As the rising moon frees the world from the fear of darkness, even so a\nBrahma _n_ a who performs a _K_ andraya _n_ a removes the fear of sin.\n\n22\\. He who lives one day on (rice)-grains, three days on oil-cakes, \'five\ndays on buttermilk mixed with water, seven days on water, and (one day) on\nair, (performs) the guilt-destroying Tulapurusha. 22\n\n23\\. Living on barley-gruel (yavaka) removes the guilt of corporeal beings\nafter seven days, and so does a fast of seven days; that has been recognised\nby wise men.\n\n24\\. By dressing in wet clothes, by living in the open air, and by exposing\nhimself to the sun during the light halves of the months Pausha (December-\nJanuary), Bhadrapada (August-September), and Gyesh _th_ a (May-June), a Brahma\n_n_ a is freed from (all) sin excepting crimes causing loss of caste\n(pataniya). 24\n\n25\\. (If one swallows) cows\' urine, cowdung, milk, 25\n\np. 327\n\nsour milk, clarified butter, and a decoction of Ku _s_ a grass, mixed with\nbarley gruel, that is the most sanctifying Brahmakur _k_ a.\n\n26\\. He who fasts on the new moon day and eats sesamum grains on the full moon\nday, will be freed in the course of a year from the sins which he committed in\nthe bright and the dark halves of the month.\n\n27\\. He who lives on alms obtained from Agnihotrins is purified in one month;\n(he who obtains his food) from a Yayavara. in ten days; he who receives it\nfrom a hermit in the forest, in five days;\n\n28\\. (He who lives) on food given by a person who has a store sufficient for\none day only, will be purified in one day; he who drinks water given by a\nperson subsisting by the Kapota-v _ri_ tti (pigeon-life), is purified in three\n(days). 28\n\n29\\. If one recites the whole _Ri_ g-veda, Ya _g_ ur-veda, and Sama-veda, or\nthrice reads one of these Vedas and fasts, (that is) a most efficient means of\npurification.\n\n30\\. Now if one is in haste to finish, one may live on air during a day, and\npass the night standing in water, that is equal (in efficacy) to a Pra _g_\napatya (K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra). 30\n\n31\\. He who at sunrise mutters the Gayatri one thousand and eight times, is\nfree from all sin, provided he has not slain a learned Brahma _n_ a.\n\np. 328\n\n32\\. He who distributes food, speaks the truth, and has compassion on all\nliving beings, is more (holy) than all those who have been purified by the\nrestraints mentioned above.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[322:1](sbe1487.htm#fr_1433) **5**. All the Dekhan MSS., including K., have\nbeen copied from p. 323 a MS. the leaves of which were out of order. After the\nfirst words of ver. 1, they have kshira _m_ dadhisarpi _h_ kusodakam, which\nbelongs to ver. 26, and they go on with the text down to IV, 7, 7, after which\nthe end of IV, 5, 1 and 2-25 given.--\'Yantra, "restraints," i.e. K _ri_ _k_\n_kh_ ras and the like, (which are called so) on account of the restraint of\nthe senses (required for them).\'--Govinda.\n\n[323:3](sbe1487.htm#fr_1434)-5. Vasish _th_ a XXIV, 5.\n\n[323:6](sbe1487.htm#fr_1435) Vasish _th_ a XXI, 20.

Sa _m_ hita I, 5, 11,4, 7; I, 1, 10, 3; VII, 1, 11, 1.\n\n[325:13](sbe1487.htm#fr_1442) Vasish _th_ a XXVII, 13.\n\n[325:14](sbe1487.htm#fr_1443) Vasish _th_ a XXVII, 14.\n\n[325:15](sbe1487.htm#fr_1444) Vish _n_ u XLVI, 18.\n\n[325:16](sbe1487.htm#fr_1445) Vish _n_ u XLVI, 20.\n\n[325:17](sbe1487.htm#fr_1446) Vasish _th_ a XXVII, 21; see above, III, 8.\n\n[325:18](sbe1487.htm#fr_1447) Vish _n_ u XLVII, 8.\n\n[326:19](sbe1487.htm#fr_1448) Vish _n_ u XLVII, 7.\n\n[326:20](sbe1487.htm#fr_1449) Vish _n_ u XLVII, 9. Govinda places this verse\nbefore Sutra 19.\n\n[326:22](sbe1487.htm#fr_1450) Vish _n_ u XLVII, 22.\n\n[326:24](sbe1487.htm#fr_1451) The meaning is that the performer is to stand in\nwet clothes during the first half of the month Pausha, in the cold season; to\nlive in the open air during the first half of Bhadrapada, in the rainy season;\nand to allow himself to be broiled by the sun in _G_ yesh _th_ a, the hottest\ntime of the hot season.\n\n[326:25](sbe1487.htm#fr_1452) I doubt if the reading of Govinda, yava _k_\namena (explained p. 327 by yavagu _h_ ) sa _m_ yuktam, \'mixed with barley-\ngruel,\' is correct. All the MSS. of the text have yavanam ekasa _m_ yukto,\nwhich I do not understand. Govinda has Brahmak _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra _h_ instead of\nBrahmakur _k_ a _h_. But see the Petersb. Diet. s. v. brahmakur _k_ a.\n\n[327:28](sbe1487.htm#fr_1453) Regarding the Kapota-v _ri_ tti, see above, III,\n2, 15.\n\n[327:30](sbe1487.htm#fr_1454) Vasish _th_ a XXVII, 17. Govinda adds after\nkartum, \'to finish," the rites connected with the Vedas\' (Sutra 1).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na IV, Adhyaya 6](sbe1488.htm)\n\n'
