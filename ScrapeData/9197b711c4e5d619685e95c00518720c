How shall we sacrifice to Agni? What words, agreeable to the god, shall be\naddressed to him, the luminous one, who, being immortal and righteous, the Hot\n_ri_ , the best sacrificer, conveys the gods to the mortals\n[1](sbe46027.htm#an_1:77:1:1)?\n\n2\\. Bring hither by adoration the Hot _ri_ who is most beneficial in\nsacrifices and righteous. When Agni repairs to the gods on behalf of the\nmortal [1](sbe46027.htm#an_1:77:2:1), may he be attentive in his mind, and may\nhe perform the sacrifice [2](sbe46027.htm#an_1:77:2:2).\n\n3\\. For he is wisdom [1](sbe46027.htm#an_1:77:3:1), he is manly, he is\nstraightforward; like Mitra he has become the charioteer of the mysterious\n[2](sbe46027.htm#an_1:77:3:2). Therefore the Aryan clans\n[3](sbe46027.htm#an_1:77:3:3), longing for the gods, address him, the\nwonderful one, as the first at the sacrifices.\n\n4\\. May that Agni, the manliest of men, triumphant with riches [?]\n[1](sbe46027.htm#an_1:77:4:1), come with help to our words, to our devotion,\nand (to the devotion) of those most powerful liberal givers who bent on the\nprize [2](sbe46027.htm#an_1:77:4:2) have constantly stirred up our prayers\n[3](sbe46027.htm#an_1:77:4:3).\n\n5\\. Thus Agni, the righteous _G_ atavedas, has been praised by the priestly\nGotamas [1](sbe46027.htm#an_1:77:5:1). May he augment their splendour and\ntheir strength. He the knowing one gains increase according to his desire.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi and metre.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. The construction is ya _h_ k _ri_ _n_ oti deva\xc2\xb4n martyeshu. Comp., for\ninstance, X, 40, 2. ka _h_ vam \xe2\x80\xa6 k _ri_ _n_ ute sadhasthe\n\np. 101\n\n[paragraph continues] a\xc2\xb4. Ludwig translates: der unter den sterblichen der\nunsterbliche hotar \xe2\x80\xa6 schafft die gotter.--'Could it be ishk _ri_ _n_ oti?' M.\nM.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. The third Pada of this verse has nine syllables instead of eleven. If\nwe read, as several times must be done, martyaya for martaya, we get ten\nsyllables, and the Pada may belong to the defective type mentioned above, 76,\n1, note 2.\n\nNote 2. _K_ a seems to me to stand here, as it several times does, in the\nfirst of the members of sentence connected by it. See Delbruck, Altindische\nSyntax, 475. Prof. Max Muller believes that it depends on yat: yat ve _h_ ,\nyat _k_ a sa bodhati, 'Bring hither the Hot _ri_ \xe2\x80\xa6 so that Agni may invite the\ngods \xe2\x80\xa6 and that he (the mortal or Agni) may be attentive, &c.'\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Grassmann gives to kratu here and in a number of other passages the\nmeaning 'der Starke.' This is inadmissible; comp. Bergaigne, III, 304.\n\nNote 2. Here we have again a Pada of ten syllables (see verse 2, note I),\nunless bhut has dissyllabic value. Prof. Max Muller translates this Pada:\n'like a friend he is the charioteer of enormous wealth.'\n\nNote 3. Comp. I, 96, 3 (see below).\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. On ri _s_ a\xc2\xb4das, comp. above, I, 26, 4, note 1.\n\nNote 2. Comp. I, 92, 8. There Ushas receives the epithet va\xc2\xb4 _g_ aprasuta.\n\nNote 3. Comp. VII, 87, 3. spa _s_ a _h_ Varu _n_ asya \xe2\x80\xa6 ye ishayanta manma.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. This is again a Pada of ten syllables.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 78](sbe46028.htm)\n\n"
