The (living) Self is not (produced) as there is no scriptural statement,\nand as it is eternal according to them (i.e. scriptural passages).\n\nThere is a Self called the living one (the individual soul), which rules the\nbody and the senses, and is connected with the fruits of actions. With regard\nto that Self the conflict of scriptural passages suggests the doubt, whether\nit is produced from Brahman like ether and the other elements, or if, like\nBrahman itself, it is unproduced. Some scriptural passages, by comparing it to\nsparks proceeding from a fire and so on, intimate that the living soul is\nproduced\n\np. 30\n\nfrom Brahman; from others again we learn that the highest Brahman, without\nundergoing any modification, passes, by entering into its effects (the\nelements), into the condition of the individual soul. These latter passages do\nnot thus record an origination of the individual soul.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that the individual soul is produced, because on\nthat view the general promissory statement is not contradicted. For the\ngeneral assertion that 'by one thing being known all this is known' is not\ncontradicted, only if the entire aggregate of things springs from Brahman;\nwhile it would be contradicted by the assumption of the individual soul being\na thing of a different kind. Nor can the individual soul be conceived as mere\nunmodified highest Self, on account of the difference of their respective\ncharacteristics. For the highest Self is characterised by freedom from sin and\nso on, while the individual soul possesses the opposite attributes. That it is\nan effect, follows moreover from its being divided. For ether and all other\nthings, in so far as divided, are effects, and we have concluded therefrom\nthat they have an origin. Hence the soul also, which is distributed through\nall the bodies, doing good and evil and experiencing pleasure and pain, must\nbe considered to originate at the time when the entire world is produced. We\nhave moreover the following scriptural passage, 'As small sparks come forth\nfrom fire, thus from that Self all vital airs,' &c. (B _ri_. Up. II, 1, 20).\nThis text teaches first the creation of the aggregate of objects of fruition,\nbeginning with the vital airs, and then (in the words, 'all the Selfs')\nseparately teaches the creation of all the enjoying souls. Again we have the\npassage, 'As from a blazing fire sparks, being of the same nature as fire, fly\nforth a thousandfold, thus are various beings brought forth from the\nImperishable, my friend, and return hither also' (Mu. Up. II, 1, 1); a passage\ndescriptive of the origin and the retractation of the souls, as we infer from\nthe statement about the sameness of nature 1.\n\np. 31\n\n[paragraph continues] For the individual souls are of the same nature as\nBrahman, because they are endowed with intelligence. Nor can the fact that in\nsome places (as, for instance, in the accounts of the creation of the\nelements) the creation of the soul is not mentioned, invalidate what is stated\nabout it in other places; it being a general principle of interpretation that\nwhatever new, and at the same time non-contradictory, matter is taught in some\nscriptural passage has to be combined with the teaching of all other passages.\nHence that passage also which speaks of the Self entering (into its effects\nand thus becoming _g_ iva) must be explained as stating the Self's passing\nover into an effect (viz. the soul), analogously to such passages as 'that\nmade itself its Self,' &c. (Taitt. Up. II, 7).--From all which it follows that\nthe individual soul is a product.\n\nTo all this we reply, that the individual soul is not a product.--Why?--On\naccount of the absence of scriptural statement. For in the chapters which\ntreat of the creation, the production of the soul is, in most cases, not\nmentioned.--But, it was admitted above that the circumstance of something not\nbeing stated in some places does not invalidate the statements made about it\nelsewhere.--True, that was admitted; but we now declare that the production of\nthe soul is not possible.--Why?--'On account of the eternity, &c., resulting\nfrom them' (i.e. the scriptural passages). The word '&c.' implies non-\noriginatedness and similar attributes. For we know from scriptural passages\nthat the soul is eternal, that it has no origin, that it is unchanging, that\nwhat constitutes the soul is the unmodified Brahman, and that the soul has its\nSelf in Brahman. A being of such a nature cannot be a product. The scriptural\npassages to which we are alluding are the following:--'The living Self dies\nnot' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 11, 3); 'This great unborn Self undecaying, undying,\nimmortal, fearless is indeed Brahman' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 25); 'The knowing\nSelf is not born, it dies not' (Ka. Up. I, 2, 18); 'The Ancient is unborn,\neternal, everlasting' (Ka. Up. I, 2, 18); 'Having sent forth that he entered\ninto it' (Taitt. Up. II, 6); 'Let me now enter those with this living Self and\nlet me then\n\np. 32\n\nevolve names and forms' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 3, 2); 'He entered thither to the very\ntips of the finger-nails' (B _ri_. Up. I, 4, 7); 'Thou art that' ( _Kh_. Up.\nVI, 8, 7); 'I am Brahman' (B _ri_. Up. II, 4,10); 'This Self is Brahman\nknowing all' (B _ri_. Up. II, 5, 19).--All these texts declare the eternity of\nthe soul, and thus militate against the view of its having been produced.--But\nit has been argued above that the soul must be a modification because it is\ndivided, and must have an origin because it is a modification!--It is not, we\nreply, in itself divided; for scripture declares that 'there is one God hidden\nin all beings, all-pervading, the Self within all beings' ( _S_ ve. Up. VI,\n11); it only appears divided owing to its limiting adjuncts, such as the mind\nand so on, just as the ether appears divided by its connexion with jars and\nthe like. Scripture (viz. B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 5, 'that Self is indeed Brahman,\nmade up of knowledge, mind, life, sight, hearing,' &c.) also declares that the\none unmodified Brahman is made up of a plurality of intellects (buddhi), &c.\nBy Brahman being made up of mind and so on is meant, that its nature is\ncoloured thereby, while the fact of its being entirely separate from it is\nnon-apparent. Analogously we say that a mean, cowardly fellow is made up of\nwomanishness.--The casual passages which speak of the soul's production and\ndissolution must therefore be interpreted on the ground of the soul's\nconnexion with its limiting adjuncts; when the adjunct is produced or\ndissolved, the soul also is said to be produced or dissolved. Thus scripture\nalso declares, 'Being altogether a mass of knowledge, having risen from out of\nthese elements it again perishes after them. When he has departed there is no\nmore knowledge' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 5, 13). What is meant there, is only the\ndissolution of the limiting adjuncts of the Self, not the dissolution of the\nSelf itself 1. The text itself explains this, in reply to Maitreyi's question\n\np. 33\n\n[paragraph continues] ('Here, Sir, thou hast landed me in utter bewilderment.\nIndeed I do not understand him, that when he has departed there is no more\nknowledge'), in the words, 'I say nothing that is bewildering. Verily,\nbeloved, that Self is imperishable and of an indestructible nature. But it\nenters into contact with the sense organs.'--Non-contradiction moreover of the\ngeneral assertion (about everything being known through one) results only from\nthe acknowledgment that Brahman is the individual soul. The difference of the\nattributes of both is also owing to the limiting adjuncts only. Moreover the\nwords 'Speak on for the sake of final deliverance' (uttered by _G_ anaka with\nreference to the instruction he receives from Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya about the vi\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ana-maya atman) implicitly deny that the Self consisting of knowledge\n(i.e. the individual soul) possesses any of the attributes of transitory\nexistence, and thus show it to be one with the highest Self.--From all this it\nfollows that the individual soul does not either originate or undergo\ndestruction.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[30:1](sbe38018.htm#fr_21) That the word bhava _h_ 'beings' here means\n'individual souls,' we conclude from their being said to have the same nature\nas the Imperishable.\n\n[32:1](sbe38018.htm#fr_22) Hence the phrase, 'there is no more knowledge,'--\nwhich seems to contradict the term 'a mass of knowledge,'--only means that, on\nthe limiting adjuncts being dissolved, there is no longer any knowledge of\ndistinctions.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 18](sbe38019.htm)\n\n"
