Here He was constantly\nsurrounded by His most beloved Sannyasin disciples and by those women\ndisciples who were especially devoted to Him.\n\nThe Sannyasin disciples were twelve in number. * Most of them were young men\nof noble families and were graduates of the University at Calcutta. They had\nleft their homes and\n\np. 412\n\nrelatives for His sake. Their one aim in life was to serve their Master, the\nliving God on earth and the Incarnation of Divinity in a human form. The love\nof Sri Ramakrishna captivated their hearts and souls. Indeed these earnest and\nsincere disciples were the pillars upon which the Divine Manifestation was\nabout to build the structure of His universal mission. The illness which the\nBhagavan had assumed upon His physical form was the means by which He gathered\nHis beloved ones around Him and gave them the opportunity to nurse and wait\nupon their Divine Master. They sacrificed their personal comfort upon the\naltar of true devotion and served their Lord with whole heart and soul day\nafter day and night after night. Their devotion was unique and unparalleled in\nthe religious history of modern India. It was these young disciples who\nafterwards became the world-renowned Swamis of the Order of Sri Ramakrishna.\nThere were also householder disciples, like Suresh, Balaram, Girish, Ram,\nMahendra and others, who used to come frequently to see Ramakrishna and to\nserve Him by supplying the household with all necessary things.\n\np. 413\n\nii\n\nRamakrishna occupied the large room on the second floor of the beautiful house\nsituated in the centre of the spacious garden. He was seated on His bed, which\nwas spread on the floor, and was surrounded by His Sannyasin and householder\ndisciples. Conversation arose concerning Sannyas (Renunciation) and a\nhouseholder\'s life, and Girish asked: Bhagavan, which is right--to renounce\nthe world with a view to avoid worldly cares and suffering or to worship God\nliving with one\'s family?\n\nTo live in the world or to renounce it.Bhagavan referred to the teaching of\nthe Bhagavad Gita and said: He who lives with his family but is unattached to\nthe relations and things of the world, who performs his duties without seeking\nthe results of his works, attains to God in the same manner as one who has\nrenounced the world after realizing that earthly relations and objects are\ntransitory and unreal. Those who renounce the world merely to avoid worldly\ncares and suffering belong to the lowest class of Sannyasins. He who has\nattained to God living in the world is like the man who resides in a\n\np. 414\n\ncrystal palace and sees everything of the outside as well as of the inside of\nthe palace.\n\nGirish: Bhagavan, why is it that mind after reaching a very high plane comes\ndown to the world?\n\nFickleness of the mind.Bhagavan: It is natural with the mind of one who lives\nin the world. Sometimes it is on a high plane and sometimes on a low.\nSometimes there is a great upheaval of devotional feeling, then again it\nsubsides, because the attraction of lust and wealth is very strong. A devotee\nwho lives in the world may meditate on God and repeat His holy Name, but again\nhis mind is attracted by the power of lust and wealth, just as a fly sometimes\nlights on the most delicious sweetmeat and sometimes relishes the taste of\nfilth or of a rotten carcass.\n\nA true Sannyasin.It is different, however, with those who have renounced the\nworld. They have detached their mind entirely from lust and wealth and have\nfixed it upon the Supreme. They constantly drink the nectar of Divine Love.\nThe mind of a true Sannyasin does not care for anything other than the\nSupreme. He leaves the place where worldly talk prevails. He listens to\ndiscourses about\n\np. 415\n\nthe highest Spiritual Truth alone. A true Sannyasin does not speak of worldly\nmatters, he utters no word which has not bearing upon the Spiritual Ideal. A\nbee sits on flowers only to drink honey. He does not care for any other\nobject. Then, referring to Rakhal (Swami Brahmananda), who had a wife and a\nchild before he renounced the world, Ramakrishna said: Rakhal and others like\nhim have now understood which is good and which is evil, which is real and\nwhich is unreal. They have realized that earthly relations are transitory and\nephemeral. They will never again be attached to the world. They are like eels\nwhich live in the mud but remain untouched by it.\n\nGirish: I do not understand all that. Thou hast the power to make everyone\nunattached to the world and free from bondage. Thou hast the power to make\neveryone perfect whether a Sannyasin or a householder. When the Malaya breeze\nblows it can transform all trees into sandalwood trees.\n\nThe worthy will become perfect.Bhagavan: But pithless trees like the banana-\nand the cotton-tree are not transformed into sandalwood. Similarly those who\nare worthy will become perfect. Worldliness means attachment to\n\np. 416\n\nlust and wealth. Many worldly people consider wealth as their heart\'s blood.\nBut if you take too much care of wealth, perhaps one day it will go entirely\nout of your possession. In our country farmers build earthen embankments round\ntheir fields. Those who do not leave open any passage for water and take too\nmuch care of their embankments, invariably have theirs washed off first by the\ntremendous current of the water; but those who keep one side open, find that\ntheir fields become enriched with alluvial deposits and more fertile in the\nend. They make the best use of their riches who spend them in the service of\nthe Lord and of holy sages. They reap good fruits of their wealth who give\nfreely to the poor and needy and for the good of humanity.\n\nThe Bhagavan continued: I cannot use any object that is given to me by\nphysicians and medical practitioners who live upon the painful diseases of\nother people. However, it is different with those physicians who are\nkindhearted, charitable and unselfish.\n\niii\n\nTo destroy the pride and egotism of His disciples, Sri Ramakrishna told them\nto wear the\n\np. 417\n\nTaught His disciples renunciation.seamless ochre robe of the Sannyasin and to\ntake up the begging-bowl. Being Himself a perfect Sannyasin, He loved to see\nHis disciples following Him in the path of renunciation. On different\noccasions He sent them out, as Buddha and Sankara had done with their\ndisciples, to beg food from door to door. One morning He called certain among\nHis beloved ones,--Narendra, Sarat, Jogen, Niranjan, Kali,--and asked them\nwhether they could go forth with the Sannyasin\'s begging-bowl and beg uncooked\nfood for Him. It was indeed a great blow to the caste pride as well as to the\nsense of self-respect of these young disciples. Obeying the Master\'s wish,\nhowever, they took the begging-bowl in their hands, walked from door to door\nin the neighborhood, collected various articles of food, brought them before\ntheir Master and offered them at His holy feet. Bhagavan Ramakrishna, blessed\nthem and rejoiced at their sincere and earnest devotion. This was the manner\nin which the Bhagavan initiated His disciples in the life of absolute\nrenunciation.\n\np. 418\n\niv\n\nMeaning of His illness.One evening Sri Ramakrishna was attended by His\nfaithful servants Sashi (Ramakrishnananda) and Kali (Abhedananda), who were\nwaiting upon Him. The Bhagavan opened His mouth and inspired them by saying:\nThe illness of my body is caused by the sins of those who come and touch my\nfeet. I purify the sinners by taking their sins upon myself and suffering for\nthem. He who was Rama, who was Krishna, Buddha, Christ and Chaitanya has now\nbecome Ramakrishna. Blessed are those who know this truth. My Divine Mother\nhas shown me that the photograph of this body will be kept upon altars and be\nworshipped in different houses as the pictures of other Avataras are\nworshipped. My Divine Mother has also shown me that I shall have to come back\nagain and that my next incarnation will be in the West.\n\nv\n\nNarendra (Vivekananda) had extreme longing for the realization of Brahman the\nAbsolute. One day Bhagavan Ramakrishna, addressing Narendra in the presence of\nother\n\np. 419\n\ndisciples, said: I hold the key of the chest which contains the treasure of\nthe highest realization. I shall not unlock that chest until you have finished\nmy work which I wish you to do.\n\nvi\n\nCure of His illness.Pandit Sashadhar came one day to pay his respects to\nBhagavan Ramakrishna. Seeing His illness, he asked Him: Bhagavan, why dost\nThou not concentrate Thy mind upon the diseased part and thus cure Thyself?\n\nThe Bhagavan replied: How can I fix my mind, which I have given to God, upon\nthis cage of flesh and blood?\n\nSashadhar said: Why dost Thou not pray to Thy Divine Mother for cure of Thy\nillness?\n\nThe Bhagavan answered: When I think of My Mother the physical body vanishes\nand I am entirely out of it, so it is impossible for Me to pray for anything\nconcerning the body.\n\nHearing this, Sashadhar bowed at His holy feet and asked His blessing.\n\nvii\n\nThe news of Sri Ramakrishna\'s illness spread like wild-fire among all those\nwho had known\n\np. 420\n\n[paragraph continues] Him or heard of His Divine personality. Hundreds of\npeople came every day to see Him and to pay reverent homage to Him. Some came\nto receive His blessing, some to kiss the dust of His Holy Feet, some to hear\na few words uttered by Him, and others to clear the doubts of their minds.\nAmong these were a few more devoted ones, like Hari, Gangadhar, Sarada, Tulsi,\nwho afterwards joined the Order and were known as Turiyananda, Akhandananda,\nTrigunatita, and Nirmalananda. Bhagavan Ramakrishna received them all with\nequal kindness and was ever ready to help them. His love for humanity.Although\nHis physical body was weakened and exhausted, still His desire to help mankind\nwas so great that He often exclaimed: "I would give twenty thousand bodies\nlike this if by that I could help one single soul in the path of righteousness\nand God-consciousness!"\n\nDr. Sircar and other physicians gave strict orders to the Sannyasin disciples\nto allow no one to come near the Bhagavan, as He needed absolute rest and must\nhave no excitement of any kind. The Sannyasin disciples followed this advice\nto the letter and would not allow even the householder disciples to come near\nHim or touch His holy body. But Sri Ramakrishna\n\np. 421\n\ncould not bear this bondage. He burst into tears when He heard of this\nrestriction. His heart melted with Divine Love and He declared that His\nsuffering was infinitely less than that of the worldly people who were\ngroaning under the burden of their worldly cares and anxieties and who had no\none to lift them above this mundane existence. His love for humanity was so\ngreat that, disregarding His bodily welfare, He called everyone near unto Him\nin the same manner as Jesus the Christ called all those who were heavily laden\nand who sought for peace and rest.\n\nMany a time the Bhagavan declared before His beloved Sannyasin children:\nDivine Mother is working through this form. She has kept it so long because\nHer work is not yet finished.\n\nHis oneness with all.When He could scarcely speak or swallow any food, the\nBhagavan said: I am now speaking and eating through so many mouths. I am the\nSoul of all individual souls. I have infinite mouths, infinite heads, infinite\nhands and feet. My pure form is spiritual. It is absolute Existence,\nIntelligence and Bliss condensed, as it were. It has neither birth nor death,\nneither sorrow, disease nor suffering. It is immortal and perfect. I\n\np. 422\n\nsee the indivisible Absolute Brahman (Sat-chit-ananda) within me as well as\nall around me. You are all like my own parts. The Infinite Brahman is\nmanifesting Itself through so many human forms. Human bodies are like pillow-\ncases of different shapes and various colors, but the cotton wool of the\ninternal Spirit is one. When Jiva (ego) enters into that Spirit and becomes\none with it, there is neither pain nor suffering. I am the Infinite Spirit\ncovered by a human skin which has a wound somewhere near the throat. Mind\naffects the body and is in turn affected by the body. When the body is ill,\nthat illness reacts upon the mind. When one is burned by hot water one says:\n"This water has burned me," but the truth is that heat burns and not the\nwater. All pain is in the body, all disease is in the body, but the Spirit is\nabove pain and beyond the reach of disease.\n\nPurpose of His illness.My illness is to teach mankind how to think of the\nSpirit and how to live in God-consciousness even when there is extreme pain in\nthe body; when the body is suffering from the agony of pain and starvation,\nwhen there is no remedy within human power, even then the Mother shows that\nSpirit is the\n\np. 423\n\nmaster of the body. My illness is to set an example of absolute mastery of the\nSpirit over matter in this age of materialism and scepticism. My Divine Mother\nhas brought this illness upon this body to convince the sceptics of the\npresent age that \xc3\x82tman is Divine, that God-consciousness is as true and\npractical today as it was in the Vedic period, that when one reaches\nperfection, freedom from all bondage is attained. My Divine Mother has shown\nthrough Her child what is meant by the various kinds of Yoga and how people of\nthis age can attain to it. She has also shown that all Scriptures are true,\nthat all religions are like paths which lead to the same common goal of the\none Infinite Divinity. All of my religious practices, Yoga practices,\ndevotional exercises have been for the good of others and not for my own good.\nMy Mother has set through this form a living example in this age.\n\n"Whosoever will practise one-sixteenth part of what I have said and done will\nsurely attain to God-consciousness in this life."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[411:*](gork17.htm#fr_103) Narendra (Vivekananda), Rakhal (Brahmananda),\nNiranjan (Niranjananda), Sashi (Ramakrishnananda), Sarat (Saradananda),\nBaburam (Premananda), Kali (Abhedananda), Jogin (Yogananda), Latoo\n(Adbhutananda), Gopal (Advaitananda), Tarak (Shivananda), Subodh\n(Subodhananda).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Index](gork18.htm)\n\n'
