Why should we not buy one?'\n\nThe Barber answered, 'Very well; here is money. Do you go and buy us a\ngarden.' So the Jackal took the Barber's money, and with it bought a fine\ngarden, in which were cucumbers, pumpkins, melons, figs, and many other good\nfruits and vegetables. And he used to go there every day, and feast to his\nheart's content. When, however, the Barber said to him, 'What is the garden\nlike which you bought with the money I gave you?' he answered, 'There are very\nfine plants in it, but there is no fruit upon them; when the fruit is ripe I\nwill let you know.' This reply satisfied the Barber, who inquired no further\nat that time.\n\nA little while afterwards the Barber again asked the Jackal about the garden,\nsaying, 'I see you go down to that garden every day; is the fruit getting\nripe?' 'Oh dear no, not yet,' answered the Jackal; 'why, the plants are only\njust coming into blossom,'\n\nBut all this time there was a great deal of fruit in the garden; and the\nJackal went there every day, and ate as much as he could.\n\nAgain, a third time, when some weeks had passed, the Barber said to him, 'Is\nthere no ripe fruit in our garden yet?' 'No,' said the Jackal; 'the blossoms\nhave only just fallen; but the fruit is forming. In time we shall have a fine\nshow of melons and figs there.'\n\nThen the Barber began to think the Jackal was deceiving him, and determined to\nsee and judge for himself. So next day, without saying anything about it, he\nfollowed him down to the garden.\n\nNow it happened that very day the Jackal had invited all his friends to come\nand feast there. All the animals in the neighbouring jungle had accepted the\ninvitation; there they came trooping by hundreds and dozens, and were very\nmerry indeed--running here and there, and eating all the melons, and\ncucumbers, and figs, and pumpkins in the place.\n\nThe Barber peeped over the hedge, and saw the assembled wild beasts, and his\nfriend the Jackal entertaining them--talking to this one, laughing with that,\nand eating with all. The good man did not dare to attack the intruders, as\nthey were many and powerful. But he went home at once, very angry, muttering\nto himself, 'I 'll be the death of that young jackanapes; he shall play no\nmore pranks in my garden.' And watching his opportunity, he returned there\nwhen the Jackal and all his friends had left, and tied a long knife to the\nlargest of the cucumbers that still remained; then he went home, and said\nnothing of what he had seen.\n\nEarly next morning the Jackal thought to himself, 'I'll just run down to the\ngarden and see if there are no cucumbers or melons left.' So he went there,\nand picking out the largest of the cucumbers, began to eat it. Quick as\nthought the long knife, that was concealed by the cucumber leaves, ran into\nhim, cutting his muzzle, his neck, and his side.\n\n'Ah! that nasty Barber!' he cried; 'this must be his doing!' And, instead of\ngoing home, he ran as fast as he could, very far away into the jungle, and\nstretching himself out on a great flat rock prepared to die.\n\nBut he did not die. Only for three whole days the pain in his neck and side\nwas so great that he could not move; moreover, he felt very weak from loss of\nblood.\n\nAt the end of the third day he tried to get up; but his own blood had sealed\nhim to the stone! He endeavoured to move it by his struggles, but could not\nsucceed. 'Oh dear! oh dear!' he murmured; 'to think that I should recover from\nmy wound, only to die such a horrible death as this! Ah, me! here is the\npunishment of dishonesty!' And, having said this, he began to weep. It\nchanced, however, that the god of Rain heard his lamentations, and taking pity\non him sent a kindly shower, which, wetting the stone, effected his release.\n\nNo sooner was the Jackal set free than he began to think what he could do to\nearn a livelihood--since he did not dare return to the Barber's house. It was\nnot long before a feasible plan struck him. All around was the mud made by the\nrecent rain; he placed a quantity of it in a small chattee, covered the top\nover carefully with leaves (as people do jars of fresh butter), and took it\ninto a neighbouring village to sell.\n\nAt the door of one of the first houses to which he came stood a woman, to whom\nthe Jackal said, 'Mai, here is butter--beautiful fresh butter! won't you buy\nsome fresh butter?' She answered, 'Are you sure it is quite fresh? Let me see\nit.' But he replied, 'It is perfectly fresh; but if you open the chattee now,\nit will be all spoilt by the time you want it. If you like to buy it, you may\ntake it; if not, I will sell it to some one else.' The woman did want some\nfresh butter, and the chattee the Jackal carried on his head was carefully\nfastened up, as if what it contained was of the best; and she knew if she\nopened it, it might spoil before her husband returned home; besides, she\nthought, if the Jackal had intended to deceive her, he would have been more\npressing in asking her to buy it. So she said, 'Very well, give me the\nchattee; here is money for you. You are sure it is the best butter?' 'It is\nthe best of its kind,'\n\nanswered the Jackal; 'only be sure you put it in some cool place, and don't\nopen it till it is wanted.' And taking the money, he ran away.\n\nA short time afterwards the woman discovered how she had been cheated, and was\nvery angry; but the Jackal was by that time far away, out of the reach of\npunishment.\n\nWhen his money was spent, the Jackal felt puzzled as to how to get a living,\nsince no one would give him food, and he could buy none. Fortunately for him,\njust then, one of the bullocks belonging to the village died. The Jackal found\nit lying dead by the roadside, and he began to eat it, and ate, and ate, and\nate so much, that at last he had got too far into the animal's body to be seen\nby passers-by. Now, the weather was hot and dry. Whilst the Jackal was in it,\nthe bullock's skin crinkled up so tightly with the heat that it became too\nhard for him to bite through, and so he could not get out again.\n\nThe Mahars  1 of the village all came out to bury the dead bullock. The\nJackal, who was inside it, feared that if they caught him they would kill him\n--and that if they did not discover him he would be buried alive--so on their\napproach he called out, 'People, people! take care how you touch me, for I am\na great saint.' The poor people were very much frightened when they heard the\ndead bullock talking, and thought that some mighty spirit must indeed possess\nit.  2 'Who are you, sir, and what do you want?' they cried. 'I,' answered the\nJackal, 'am a very holy saint. I am also the god of your village, and I am\nvery angry with you because you never worship me, nor bring me offerings.'--'O\nmy Lord,' they cried; 'what offerings will please you? Tell us only, and we\nwill bring you whatever you like.'--'Good,' he replied. 'Then you must fetch\nhere plenty of rice, plenty of flowers, and a nice fat chicken--place them as\nan offering beside me, and pour a great deal of water over them, as you do at\nyour most solemn feasts, and then I will forgive you your sins.' The Mahars\ndid as they were commanded. They placed some rice and flowers, and the best\nchicken they could procure, beside the bullock; and poured water over it and\nthe offering. Then no sooner did the dry hard bullock's skin get wetted, than\nit split in many places, and to the surprise of all his worshippers the Jackal\njumped out, seized the chicken in. his mouth, and ran away with it, through\nthe midst of them, into the jungle. The Mahars followed him over hedges and\nditches for many, many miles, but he got away in spite of them all.\n\nOn, on, he ran--on, on, for a very long way, until at last he came to a place\nwhere a little kid lived under a little sicakai  3 tree. All her relations and\nfriends were away, and when she saw him coming she thought to herself, 'Unless\nI frighten this Jackal he will eat me.' So she ran as hard as she could up\nagainst the sicakai-tree, which made all the branches shake, and the leaves go\nrustle, rustle, rustle. When the Jackal heard the rustling noise he got\nfrightened, and thought it was all the little kid's friends coming to help\nher. And she called out to him, 'Run away, Jackal, run away! Thousands and\nthousands of Jackals have run away at that sound--run away for your life!' And\nthe Jackal was so frightened that he ran away. So, he who had deceived so many\nwas outwitted by a simple little kid!\n\nAfter this the Jackal found his way back to his own village, where the Barber\nlived, and there for some time he used to prowl round the houses every night,\nand live upon any bones he could find. The villagers did not like his coming,\nbut did not know how to catch him, until one night his old friend the Barber\n(who had never forgiven him for stealing the fruit from the garden) caught him\nin a great net, having before made many unsuccessful attempts to do so. 'Aha!'\ncried the Barber; 'I've got you at last, my friend. You did not escape death\nfrom the cucumber-knife for nothing! you won't get away this time. Here, wife!\nwife! see what a prize I have got!' The Barber's wife came running to the\ndoor; and the Barber gave her the Jackal (after he had tied all his four legs\nfirmly together with a strong rope), and said to her, 'Take this animal into\nthe house, and be sure you don't let him escape, while I fetch a knife to kill\nhim with.' The Barber's wife did as she was bid, and taking the Jackal into\nthe house laid him down on the floor. But no sooner had the Barber gone, than\nthe Jackal said to her, 'Ah, good woman, your husband will return directly and\nput me to death. For the love of heaven, loosen the rope round my feet before\nhe comes, for one minute only, and let me drink a little water from that\npuddle by the door, for my throat is parched with thirst.'--' No, no, friend\nJackal,' answered the Barber's wife. 'I know well enough what you 'll do. No\nsooner shall I have untied your feet, than you will run away, and when my\nhusband returns and finds you are gone he will beat me.'\n\n'Indeed, indeed, I will not run away,' he replied. 'Ah, kind mother, have pity\non me--only for one little moment.' Then the Barber's wife thought, 'Well, it\nis hard not to grant the poor beast's last request--he will not live long\nenough to have many more pleasures.' So she untied the Jackal's feet, and held\nhim by a rope, that he might drink from the puddle. But quick as possible, he\ngave a jump, and a twist, and a pull, and jerking the rope out of her hand\nescaped once more into the jungle.\n\nFor some time he roamed up and down, living on what he could get in this\nvillage or that, until he had wandered very far away from the country where\nthe Barber lived. At last one day, by chance, he passed a certain cottage, in\nwhich there dwelt a very poor Brahman, who had seven daughters.\n\nAs the Jackal passed by, the Brahman was saying to himself, 'O dear me, what\ncan I do for my seven daughters! I shall have to support them all my life, for\nthey are much too poor ever to get married. If a dog or a Jackal were to offer\nto take one off my hands, he should have her.' Next day the Jackal called on\nthe Brahman and said to him, 'You said yesterday if a Jackal or a dog were to\noffer to marry one of your daughters, you would let him have her; will you,\ntherefore, accept me as a son-in-law?'\n\nThe Brahman felt very much embarrassed, but it was certain he had said the\nwords, and therefore he felt in honour bound not to retract, although he had\nlittle dreamed of ever being placed in such a predicament. Just at that moment\nall the seven daughters began crying for bread, and the father had no bread to\ngive them.\n\nObserving this, the Jackal continued, 'Let me marry one of your seven\ndaughters, and I will take care of her. It will at least leave you one less to\nprovide for, and I will see that she never needs food.' Then the Brahman's\nheart was softened, and he gave the Jackal his eldest daughter in marriage,\nand the Jackal took her home to his den in the high rocks.\n\nNow you will say there never was a jackal so clever as this. Very true; for\nthis was not a common jackal, or he could never have done all that I have told\nyou. This Jackal was, in fact, a great Rajah in disguise, who, to amuse\nhimself, took the form of a jackal; for he was a great Magician as well as a\ngreat Prince.\n\nThe den to which he took the Brahman's daughter looked like quite a common\nhole in the rocks on the outside, but inside it was a splendid palace; adorned\nwith silver, and gold, and ivory, and precious stones. But even his own wife\ndid not know that he was always a Jackal, for the Rajah never took his human\nform except every morning very early, when he used to take off the jackal skin\nand wash it and brush it and put it on again.\n\nAfter he and his wife, the Brahman's daughter, had lived up in their home in\nthe rocks happily for some time, who should the Jackal see one day but his\nfather-in-law, the old Brahman, climbing up the hill to come and pay him a\nvisit! The Jackal was vexed to see the Brahman, for he knew he was very poor,\nand thought he had most likely come to beg--and so it was. The Brahman said to\nhim, 'Son-in-law, let me come into your cave and rest a little while. I want\nto ask you to help me, for I am very badly off, and much in need of help.'\n\n'Don't go into my cave,' said the Jackal, 'it is but a poor hole, not fit for\nyou to enter (for he did not wish his father-in-law to see his fIne palace);\n'but I will call my wife, that you may see I have not eaten her up, and she\nand you and I will talk over the matter, and see what we can do for you.'\n\nSo the Brahman, the Brahman's daughter, and the Jackal all sat down on the\nhillside together, and the Brahman said, 'I don't know what to do to get food\nfor myself, my wife, and my six daughters. Son-in-law Jackal, cannot you help\nme?'\n\n'It is a difficult business,' answered the Jackal, 'but I'll do what I can for\nyou;' and he ran to his cave and fetched a large melon, and gave it to the\nBrahman, saying, 'Father-in-law, you must take this melon, and plant it in\nyour garden, and when it grows up, sell the fruit you find upon it, and that\nwill bring you in some money.' So the Brahman took the melon home with him,\nand planted it in his garden.\n\nBy next day the melon that the Jackal had given him had grown up in the\nBrahman's garden into a fine plant, covered with hundreds of beautiful ripe\nmelons. The Brahman, his wife, and family were overjoyed at the sight. And all\nthe neighbours were astonished, and said, 'How fast that fine melon plant has\ngrown in the Brahman's garden!'\n\nNow it chanced that a woman who lived in a house close by wanted some melons,\nand seeing what fine ones these were she went down at once to the Brahman's\nhouse and bought two or three from the Brahman's wife. She took them home with\nher, and cut them open--but then, lo and behold I marvel of marvels! what a\nwonderful sight astonished her! Instead of the thick white pulp she expected\nto see, the whole of the inside of the melon was composed of diamonds, rubies,\nand emeralds; and all the seeds were enormous pearls. She immediately locked\nher door, and taking with her all the money she had, ran back to the Brahman's\nwife, and said to her, 'Those were very good melons you sold me, I like them\nso much that I will buy all the others on your melon plant.' And giving her\nthe money, she took home the rest of the melons. Now this cunning woman told\nnone of her friends of the treasure she had found, and the poor stupid Brahman\nand his family did not know what they had lost, for they had never thought of\nopening any of the melons; so that for all the precious stones they sold they\nonly got a few pice. 4\n\nNext day when they looked out of the window, the melon plant was again covered\nwith fine ripe melons, and again the woman who had bought those which had\ngrown the day before came and bought them all. And this went on for several\ndays. There were so many melons, and all the melons were so full of precious\nstones, that the woman who bought them had enough to fill the whole of one\nroom in her house with diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and pearls.\n\nAt last, however, the wonderful melon plant began to wither, and when the\nwoman came to buy melons one morning, the Brahman's wife was obliged to say to\nher in a sad voice, 'Alas! there are no more melons on our melon plant.' And\nthe woman went back to her own house very much disappointed.\n\nThat day the Brahman and his wife and children had no money in the house to\nbuy food, and they all felt very unhappy to think that the fine melon plant\nhad withered. But the Brahman's youngest daughter, who was a clever girl,\nthought, 'Though there are no more melons fit to sell on our melon plant,\nperhaps I may be able to find one or two shrivelled ones, which, if cooked,\nwill give us something for dinner.' So she went out to look, and searching\ncarefully amongst the thick leaves, found two or three withered little melons\nstill remaining. These she took into the house and began cutting them up to\ncook, when, more wonderful than wonderful! within each little melon she found\na number of small emeralds, rubies, diamonds, and pearls I The girl called her\nfather and mother, and her five sisters, crying, 'See what I have found! See\nthese precious stones and pearls! I dare say inside the melons we sold there\nwere as good or better than these. No wonder that woman was so anxious to buy\nthem all. See, father--see, mother--see, sisters!'\n\nThen they were all overjoyed to see the treasure; but the Brahman said, 'What\na pity we have lost the benefit of my son-in-law the Jackal's good gift, by\nnot knowing its worth! I will go at once to that woman, and try and make her\ngive us back the melons she took.'\n\nSo he went to the melon buyer's house, and said to her, 'Give me back the\nmelons you took from me, who did not know their worth.' She answered, 'I don't\nknow what you mean.' He replied, 'You are very deceitful; you bought melons\nfull of precious stones from us poor people who did not know what they were\nworth, and you only paid for them the price of common melons--give me some of\nthem back, I pray you.' But she said, 'I bought common melons from your wife,\nand made them all into common soup long ago; therefore, talk no further\nnonsense about jewels, but go about your business.' And she turned him out of\nthe house. Yet all this time she had a whole room full of the emeralds,\ndiamonds, rubies, and pearls, that she had found in the melons the Brahman's\nwife had sold her.\n\nThe Brahman returned home, and said to his wife, 'I cannot make that woman\ngive me back any of the melons you sold her; but give me the precious stones\nour daughter has just found, and I will sell them to a jeweller, and bring\nhome some money.' So he went to the town, and took the precious stones to a\njeweller, and said to him, 'What will you give me for these?' But no sooner\ndid the jeweller see them, than he said, 'How could such a poor man as you\nbecome possessed of such precious stones? You must have stolen them: you are a\nthief! You have stolen these from my shop, and now come to sell them to me!'\n\n'No, no, sir; indeed no, sir,' cried the Brahman. 'Thief! thief!' shouted the\njeweller. 'In truth, no, sir,' said the Brahman, 'my son-in-law, the Jackal,\ngave me a melon plant; and in one of the melons I found these jewels.'--' I\ndon't believe a word you say,' screamed the jeweller (and he began beating the\nBrahman, whom he held by the arm); 'give up those jewels which you have stolen\nfrom my shop! '--'No, I won't,' roared the Brahman; 'oh! oh-o! oh-o-o! don't\nbeat me so; I didn't steal them.' But the jeweller was determined to get the\njewels; so he beat the Brahman, and called the police, who came running up to\nhis assistance, and shouted till a great crowd of people had collected round\nhis shop. Then he said to the Brahman, 'Give me up the jewels you stole from\nme, or I'll give you to the police, and you shall be put in jaiL' The Brahman\ntried to tell his story about his son-in-law the Jackal, but of course nobody\nbelieved him; and he was obliged to give the precious stones to the jeweller,\nin order to escape the police, and to run home as fast as he could. And every\none thought the jeweller was very kind to let him off so easily.\n\nAll his family were very unhappy when they heard what had befallen him. But\nhis wife said, 'You had better go again to our son-in-law the Jackal, and see\nwhat he can do for us.' So next day the Brahman climbed the hill again as he\nhad done before, and went to call upon the Jackal When the Jackal saw him\ncoming he was not very well pleased. So he went to meet him,. and said,\n'Father-in-law, I did not expect to see you again so soon! '--'I merely came\nto see how you were,' answered the Brahman, 'and to tell you how poor we are;\nand how glad we should be of any help you can give us.'--' What have you done\nwith the melons I gave you?' asked the Jackal. 'Ah,' answered the Brahman,\n'that is a sad story!' And beginning at the beginning, he related how they had\nsold almost all the melons without knowing their value; and how the few\nprecious stones they had found had been taken from him by the jeweller. When\nthe Jackal heard this, he laughed very much, and said, 'I see it is no use\ngiving such unlucky people as you gold or jewels, for they will only bring you\ninto trouble. Come, I'll give you a more useful present.' So, running into his\ncave, he fetched thence a small chattee, and gave it to the Brahman, saying,\n'Take this chattee; whenever you or any of the family are hungry, you will\nalways find in it as good a dinner as this.' And putting his paw into the\nchattee, he extracted thence currie, and rice, and pilau,  5 and all sorts of\ngood things, enough to feast a hundred men; and the more he took out of the\nchattee, the more remained inside.\n\nWhen the Brahman saw the chattee, and smelt the good dinner, his eyes\nglistened for joy; and he embraced the Jackal, saying, 'Dear son-in-law, you\nare the only support of our house.' And he took his new present carefully home\nwith him.\n\nAfter this, for some time, the whole family led a very happy life, for they\nnever wanted good food; every day the Brahman, his wife, and his six\ndaughters, found inside the chattee a most delicious dinner; and every day\nwhen they had dined they placed it on a shelf, to find it replenished when\nnext it was needed.\n\nBut it happened that hard by there lived another Brahman, a very great man who\nwas much in the Rajah's confidence; and this man smelt daily the smell of a\nvery nice dinner, which puzzled him a good deal. The rich Brahman thought it\nsmelt even nicer than his own dinner, for which he paid so much; and yet it\nseemed to come from the poor Brahman's little cottage. So one day he\ndetermined to find out all about it; and, going to call on his neighbour, he\nsaid to him, 'Every day, at about twelve o'clock, I smell such a very nice\ndinner--much nicer than my own; and it seems to come from your house. You must\nlive on very good things, I think, although you seem so poor.'\n\nThen, in the pride of his heart, the poor Brahman invited his rich neighbour\nto come and dine with him; and lifting the magic  chattee down from the shelf,\ntook out of it such delicate fare as the other had never before tasted. And in\nan evil hour he proceeded to tell his friend of the wondrous properties of the\nchattee, which his son-in-law the Jackal had given him; and how it never was\nempty! No sooner had the great man learned this, than he went to the Rajah,\nand said to him, 'There is a poor Brahman in the town who possesses a\nwonderful chattee, which is always filled with the most delicious dinner. I\nshould not feel authorised to deprive him of it; but if it pleased your\nhighness to take it from him he could not complain.' The Rajah hearing this,\ndetermined to see and taste for himself. So he said, 'I should very much like\nto see this chattee with my own eyes.' And he accompanied the rich Brahman to\nthe poor Brahman's house. The poor Brahman was overjoyed at being noticed by\nthe Rajah himself, and gladly exhibited the various excellences of the\nchattee; but no sooner did the Rajah taste the dinner it contained, than he\nordered his guards to seize it, and take it away to the palace, in spite of\nthe Brahman's tears and protestations; thus, for a second time, he lost the\nbenefit of his son-in-law's gift.\n\nWhen the Rajah had gone, the Brahman said to his wife, 'There is nothing for\nit but to go again to the Jackal, and see if he can help us.'--' If you don't\ntake care,' she answered, 'you 'll put him out of all patience at last; I\ncan't think why you need to have gone talking about our chattee.'\n\nWhen the Jackal heard the Brahman's story he became very cross, and said,\n'What a stupid old man you were to say anything about the chattee; but see,\nhere is another, which may aid you to get back the first. Take care of it, for\nthis is the last time I will help you.' And he gave the Brahman a chattee, in\nwhich was a stout stick tied to a very strong rope. 'Take this,' he said,\n'into the presence of those who deprived you of my other gifts, and when you\nopen the chattee, command the stick to beat them; this it will do so\neffectually, that they will gladly return you what you have lost; only take\ncare not to open the chattee when you are alone, or the stick that is in it\nwill punish your rashness.'\n\nThe Brahman thanked his son-in-law, and took away the chattee; but he found it\nhard to believe all that had been said. So, going through the jungle on his\nway home, he uncovered it just to peep in and see if the stick were really\nthere. No sooner had he done this, than out jumped the rope, out jumped the\nstick; the rope seized him and bound him to a tree, and the stick beat him,\nand beat him, and beat him, until he was nearly killed. 'Oh dear! oh dear!'\nscreamed the Brahman, 'what an unlucky man I am! Oh dear! oh dear! stop,\nplease stop! good stick, stop! what a very good stick this is!' But the stick\nwould not stop, but beat him so much that he could hardly crawl home again.\n\nThen the Brahman put the rope and stick back again into the chattee, and sent\nto his rich neighbour and to the Rajah, and said to them, 'I have a new\nchattee, much better than the old one; do come and see what a fine one it is.'\nAnd the rich Brahman and the Rajah thought, 'This is something good; doubtless\nthere is a choice dinner in this chattee also, and we will take it from this\nfoolish man as we did the other.' So they went down to meet the Brahman in the\njungle, taking with them all their followers and attendants. Then the Brahman\nuncovered his chattee, saying, 'Beat, stick, beat--beat them every one!' and\nthe stick jumped out, and the rope jumped out, and the rope caught hold of the\nRajah and the rich Brahman and all their attendants, and tied them fast to the\ntrees that grew around; and the stick ran from one to another, beating,\nbeating, beating, beating the Rajah, beating his courtiers, beating the rich\nBrahman, beating his attendants, and beating all their followers; while the\npoor Brahman cried with all his might, 'Give me back my chattee--give me back\nmy chattee!'\n\nAt this the Rajah and his people were very much frightened, and thought they\nwere going to be killed. And the Rajah said to the Brahman, 'Take away your\nstick, only take away your stick, and you shall have back your chattee.' So\nthe Brahman put the stick and rope back into the chattee, and the Rajah\nreturned him the dinner-making chattee. And all the people felt very much\nafraid of the Brahman, and respected him very much.\n\nThen he took the chattee containing the rope and stick to the house of the\nwoman who had bought the melons, and the rope caught her, and the stick beat\nher; and the Brahman cried, 'Return me those melons, return me those melons!'\nAnd the woman said, 'Only make your stick stop beating me, and you shall have\nback all the melons.' So he ordered the stick back into the chattee, and she\nreturned him them forthwith--a whole roomful of melons full of diamonds,\npearls, emeralds, and rubies.\n\nThe Brahman took them home to his wife, and going into the town, with the help\nof his good stick, forced the jeweller who had deprived him of the little\nemeralds, rubies, diamonds, and pearls he had taken to sell to give them back\nto him again, and having accomplished this, he returned to his family; and\nfrom that time they all lived very happily. Then, one day the Jackal's wife\ninvited her six sisters to come and pay her a visit Now the youngest sister\nwas more clever than any of the others; and it happened that, very early in\nthe morning, she saw her brother-in-law the Jackal take off the jackal skin,\nand wash it, and brush it, and hang it up to dry; and when he had taken off\nthe jackal-skin coat, he looked the handsomest Prince that ever was seen. Then\nhis little sister-in-law ran, quickly and quietly, and stole away the jackal-\nskin coat, and threw it on the fire and burnt it. And she awoke her sister,\nand said, 'Sister, sister, your husband is no longer a jackal; see, that is he\nstanding by the door.' So the Jackal Rajah's wife ran to the door to meet her\nhusband, and because the jackal's skin was burnt, and he could wear it no\nlonger, he continued to be a man for the rest of his life, and gave up playing\nall jackal-like pranks; and he and his wife, and his father and mother and\nsisters in law, lived very happily for the rest of their days.\n\n![](img/27.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1](odd16.htm#fr_60) The lowest castes employed as scavengers in every\nvillage.\n\n[2](odd16.htm#fr_61) See Notes.\n\n[3](odd16.htm#fr_62) Acacia concinna.\n\n[4](odd16.htm#fr_63) A pice is equal to about 1/2d.\n\n[5](odd16.htm#fr_64) Cooked meat with almonds, raisins, and spice.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII.
