Let him first examine the family (of the intended bride or bridegroom),\nas it has been said above,\n\np. 165\n\n[paragraph continues] 'Those who on the mother's and on the father's side.'\n\n2\\. Let him give the girl to a (young man) endowed with intelligence.\n\n3\\. Let him marry a girl that shows the characteristics of intelligence,\nbeauty, and moral conduct, and who is free from disease.\n\n4 4. As the characteristics (mentioned in the preceding Sutra) are difficult\nto discern, let him make eight lumps (of earth), recite over the lumps the\nfollowing formula, 'Right has been born first, in the beginning; on the right\ntruth is founded. For what (destiny) this girl is born, that may she attain\nhere. What is true may that be seen,' and let him say to the girl, 'Take one\nof these.'\n\n5 5. If she chooses the (lump of earth taken) from a field that yields two\ncrops (in one year), he may know, 'Her offspring will be rich in food.' If\nfrom a cow-stable, rich in cattle. If from the earth of a Vedi (altar), rich\nin holy lustre. If from a pool which does not dry up, rich in everything. If\nfrom a gambling-place, addicted to gambling. If from a place where four roads\nmeet, wandering to different directions. If from a barren spot, poor. If from\na burial-ground, (she will) bring death to her husband.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[164:5_1](sbe29104.htm#fr_378) 5, 1. _S_ rauta-sutra IX, 3, 20, 'Who on their\nmother's as well as p. 165 on their father's side through ten generations are\nendowed with knowledge, austerity, and meritorious works,' &c.\n\n[165:4](sbe29104.htm#fr_379) I prefer the reading of the Bibliotheca Indica\nedition, countenanced by Naraya _n_ a's commentary, durvi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ eyani laksha\n_n_ aniti, &c. The lumps are to be taken from the eight places mentioned in\nSutra 5.\n\n[165:5](sbe29104.htm#fr_380) No doubt the correct reading is not that given by\nNaraya _n_ a and accepted by Professor Stenzler, dvipravra _g_ ini, but\nvipravra _g_ ini, as four of Professor Stenzler's MSS. read (see his Variae\nLectiones, p. 48, and the Petersburg Dictionary s. v. vipravra _g_ in).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 6](sbe29105.htm)\n\n"
