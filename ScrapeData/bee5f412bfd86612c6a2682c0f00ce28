Vyasa said :-- Soon the Devas reached Vaikun _t_ ha, protected by Vi _sn_\nu; they at once began to look at the exquisite indescribable beauty of the\nplace. At intervals they saw nice lovely divine houses, shining and appearing\nvery splendid; pools and lakes were seen in front of them beautified with\nKalhara lotus flowers. They began to see, at other places, rivers flowing;\nswans, cranes, Chakravakas and other aquatic birds were swimming there easily\nand warbling lovely sounds. At other places again, beautiful gardens came to\ntheir sight adorned exquisitely by Champaka, As'oka Mandara, Bakula, \xc3\x82mrataka,\nTilaka, Kuruvaka and Mallika and various other flower trees, the cuckoos were\nseen there cooing melodiously, bees humming gently and peacocks dancing\nbeautifully.\n\n\n\n5-6. In the centre was situated the golden palace of Hari, towering to\nheavens, the rooms and quadrangles were all charming; at places, they were\nbedecked with gems and jewels and adorned with various paintings. There was\nthe Divine Seat in the centre, composed wholly of gems and jewels; and Vi _sn_\nu was occupying this place. There were Vi _sn_ u's Parisadas or attendants,\nSunanda, Nandana, and others; they were so much devoted to their master that\ntheir hearts never become attached to any other thing; so they were devotedly\nsinging His praises and chanting His hymns with undivided attention.\n\n\n\n7-10. There were dancing the Apsaras (celestial nymphs) and the Devas,\nGandarbhas, and Kinnaras were singing in melodious tunes. Those who love the\nchanting of the Vedas, such calm-tempered Munis were reciting the Vedic Suktas\nand thus highly extolled Him. The two lovely gate-keepers Jaya and Vijaya were\nwaiting at the entrance gate with golden sticks in their hands; the Devas\ncoming nigh the city of Vi _sn_ u caught sight of them and said :-- \xc2\x93Any of\nyou may go and inform Vi _sn_ u that Brahma, Rudra, and the whole host of gods\nare waiting at His door to see Him.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n11\\. Vyasa said :-- O king! Hearing their words, Vijaya went away at once to\nVi _sn_ u; and, saluting Him, informed Him of the arrival of the Devas.\n\n\n\n12-13. Vijaya said :-- O Lord! Thou destroyest the enemies of the gods; hence\nThou art the most worshipped of them. O Lord of Rama! The whole hosts of gods\nhave come and are waiting at Thy door, O Bibhu!\n\n\n\np. 377\n\n\n\nBrahma, Rudra, Indra, Varu _n_ a, Fire and Yama and other gods, anxious to see\nThee, are all praising Thee by proper hymns.\n\n\n\n14-32. Vyasa said :-- Hearing Vijaya's words, Vi _sn_ u, the Lord of Rama\nbecame very anxious and soon went out of his room to see the Devas. Hari came\nup to them and seeing the Devas waiting at the doors very morose and tired,\ncheered them up by casting a favourable glance full affection and love. The\ngods bowed down and praised hymns to Jagannatha the Deva of the Devas, the\nenemy of the Daityas and revealed in the Vedas. O Deva of the Devas! Thou art\nthe Creator, Preserver and the Destroyer of the worlds; Thou art the ocean of\nmercy and the sole refuge of this Universe; O Lord! We have come to Thee as\nour Great Refuge; therefore dost Thou save us from the present difficulty.\nThus praised by the gods, Vi _sn_ u said :-- O Immortals! Take your respective\nseats and speak how are you all? Why have you all in a body come here? Why are\nyou so much depressed and worn out with cares? Why do you look so melancholy?\nSay soon for what purpose you with Brahma and Rudra have come here. The Devas\nsaid :-- \xc2\x93O Lord! The Asura Mahi _s_ a is very cruel and wicked; always\naddicted to vicious acts; now that most sinful Danava has become very much\npuffed up with pride and is tormenting us always. What more shall we say than\nthis, he is appropriating to himself the share of the Yaj\xc3\xb1as performed by the\nBrahmins; we are therefore, terror-stricken and are wandering in mountains and\nfastnesses. O Destroyer of Madhu! He has become unconquerable due to his being\ngranted the boon; considering, therefore, the gravity of our situation we have\ntaken refuge unto Thee. O Kri _sn_ a! Thou art acquainted with all the tricks\nand Maya of the Daityas; therefore Thou art capable to kill them. Therefore\nThou alone art able to deliver us from the present difficulty; be pleased,\ntherefore; to Devise means for that purpose. The Creator Brahma has granted\nhim this boon that the demon could not killed by any man; therefore we are\nasking you where can we get a female who will be able to kill that hypocrite\nin battle. Mahi _s_ a has turned out very wicked on the strength of that boon;\nsay, therefore, who amongst Uma, Lak _s_ mi, S'achi, or Vidya or any other\nwoman will be able to kill him. Therefore, O Gracious One to faithful\nworshippers and attendants! Thou art the Preserver of this world; now Devise\nspecially the cause of his death and carry out the purpose of the gods.\xc2\x94 Vyasa\nsaid :-- O king! Vi _sn_ u on hearing their words, spoke smiling \xc2\x93We fought\nbefore; but this Asura could not at that time be killed. Hence if some\nbeautiful female Deity be now created out of the collective energy and form of\nthe S'aktis of each of the Devas, then that Lady would be able easily to\ndestroy that Demon\n\n\n\np. 378\n\n\n\nby sheer force. The Lady Deity then sprung from the collective energy of ours,\nwould at once be able to destroy that Mahi _s_ a, elated on his getting the\npower, though he is skilled in hundreds of Mayas (magics). Therefore ask ye\nnow all, with your wives respectively, boons from that portion which resides\nin you all in the form of Fiery Energy, that the collected energy thus\nmanifested may assume the form of a Lady. We will then offer unto Her, all the\nDivine weapons, the trident, etc., that belong to us. That Deity, then, full\nof energy and with all the weapons in Her hands would kill that wicked Demon,\nvicious and swelled with vanity.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n33-46. Vyasa said :-- On Vi _sn_ u, the Lord of the Devas, saying thus, came\nout spontaneously, at once, of the face of Brahma, the brilliant fiery energy,\nvery difficult to conceive. That energy looked red like gems and pearls, hot,\nat the same time, a little cool, having a beautiful form, and encircled by a\nhalo of light. O King! The high-souled Hari and Hara, of mighty valor, were\nastonished to see this Fire, emitted from Brahma. Next came out of the body of\nS'ankara, His fiery spirit, quite in abundance and very wonderful to behold;\nit was silvery white, terrible, unbearable, and incapable of being seen even\nwith difficulty. It extended like a mountain and looked horrible as if the\nincarnation of the Tamo Gu _n_ a like another Tamo Gu _n_ a (S'iva is the\nincarnation of Tamo Gu _n_ a that destroys everything). It was very surprising\nto the Devas and very fearful to the Daityas. Next a dazzling light of blue\ncolour emanated from the body of Vi _sn_ u. The light that came out of the\nbody of Indra was hardly bearable, of a beautiful variegated colour, and\ncomprised in itself the three qualities. Thus masses of lights came out\nrespectively from Kuvera, Yama, Fire and Varu _n_ a. The other Devas, too,\ngave their shares of fiery lights, very lustrous and splendid. Then these all\nunited into a great Mass of Fire and Light. Like another Himalayan mountain\nshone full their lustrous Divine light; Vi _sn_ u and the other Devas were all\nextremely surprised to see this. While the Devas were thus looking steadfastly\non that Fire, an exquisitely handsome Lady was born out of it, causing\nexcitement and wonder to all. This Lady was Maha Lak _s_ mi; composed of the\nthree qualities of the three colours, beautiful, and fascinating to the\nuniverse. Her face was white, eyes were black, her lips were red and the palms\nof her hands were copper-red. She was adorned with divine ornaments. The\nGoddess was now manifest with eighteen hands, though She had a thousand hands\n(in Her unmanifested state). Now She became manifest out of the mass of fire,\nfor the destruction of the Asuras.\n\n\n\np. 379\n\n\n\n47-52. Janamejaya said :-- O Best of the Munis! O Kri _sn_ a! You are highly\nfortunate and you are all-knowing. Kindly describe, in detail the birth of Her\nbody. O Deva! Please say whether the energies of all the gods united into one\nor remained separate? Whether Her body and Her limbs were all luminous. Was it\nthat Her face, nose, eyes, etc., and all other parts of Her body were created\nout of the different fires respectively or whether was it that those limbs\nwere fashioned when the different fires blended into one huge mass? Describe,\nin detail, the origin of the body and the several limbs thereof; also inform\nme the limbs that were produced out of the corresponding Deva's fiery part; as\nwell tell me the several ornaments and several weapons given by the several\nDevas respectively. I am very desirous to hear all these from your lotus-like\nmouth. O Brahma _n_! Hearing from your lotus-like mouth the life and doings of\nMaha Lak _s_ mi, the sweet juice as they are, I am as yet not satiated (and am\ndesirous to hear more).\n\n\n\n53\\. Suta said :-- Veda Vyasa, the son of Satyavati, hearing his words\naddressed him in the following sweet words :--\n\n\n\n54\\. \xc2\x93O Best of Kuras! Very fortunate you are. I will describe in detail, to\nthe best of my understanding, the origin of Her body.\n\n\n\n55\\. Even Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, Mahes'a and Indra are never competent enough to\ndescribe Her form properly.\n\n\n\n56\\. As I already told you that She sprung at the instant the word was spoken,\nhow then can I ascertain the form or likeness of the Devi.\n\n\n\n57\\. She is constant, She is always existent; though She is one, yet She\nassumes different forms for the fulfilment of the Deva's ends, whenever their\npositions become serious.\n\n\n\n58-59. Though the actor is one, yet for the entertainment of the spectators,\nhe assumes different forms in the stage, so the Nirgu _n_ a Devi, though\nformless, assumes in Her pastime, many different forms of Sattvic, Rajasic or\nTamasic qualities, to fulfill the Deva's purposes.\n\n\n\n60\\. There are various names given to Her, according as the works done by Her\nvary immensely in their natures, just as the meanings of one root vary, some\nbeing principal and some secondary, according to the meanings and objects they\nconvey.\n\n\n\n61\\. O King! I will now describe to you as far as my knowledge goes, the\nExcellent Form that came out of that mass of Celestial Light.\n\n\n\np. 380\n\n\n\n62\\. Her grand beautiful white lotus-like face was created out of the fiery\nenergy of S'ankara.\n\n\n\n63\\. Her glossy black beautiful hairs of the head, overhanging to the knees,\nwere formed out of the light of Yama; these all came to a fine pointed end.\n\n\n\n64\\. Her three eyes came out of the energy of Fire; the pupils of those eyes\nwere of a black colour; the middle parts were of a white colour and the ends\nwere red.\n\n\n\n65\\. The two eyebrows of the Devi were black and came out of the spirit of\nSandhya (twilights); they were nicely curved and were looking spirited, like\nthe bow of the Cupid and they were shedding, as it were, cooling rays.\n\n\n\n66\\. From the light of Vayu (air), Her two ears were created; they were not\nvery long, nor very short, beautiful like the swinging seat (rocking chair) of\nthe God of Love.\n\n\n\n67\\. Her nose was fashioned out of the fire of Kuvera, the Lord of wealth; it\nlooked like the til flower, glassy and exquisitely charming.\n\n\n\n68\\. O King! Her pointed rows of glossy and brilliant teeth, looking like\ngems, came out of the energy of Dak _s_ a; they looked like the Kunda flowers.\n\n\n\n69\\. Her lower lip was deep red and it came out of the fire of Aru _n_ a (the\ncharioteer of the Sun); Her beautiful upper lip came out of the energy of\nKartika.\n\n\n\n70\\. Her eighteen hands came out of the Tejas of Vi _sn_ u and Her red fingers\ncame out of the Tejas of the Vasus.\n\n\n\n71\\. Her breasts came out of the energy of Soma and Her middle (navel) with\nthree folds was created out of the spirit of Indra.\n\n\n\n72\\. Her thighs and legs were from Varu _n_ a and Her spacious loins came out\nfrom Earth.\n\n\n\n73-74. O King! Thus from the various Tejas, contributed by the Devas, that\nHeavenly Lady came out. Her body and the several parts thereof were beautiful;\nHer form was incomparably graceful and the voice was exquisitely sonorous and\nlovely. The Devas, oppressed by Mahi _s_ asura, became overpowered with joy\nseeing this well decorated Devi, having beautiful eyes and teeth, and charming\nin all respects.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\np. 381\n\n\n\n75\\. Vi _sn_ u then addressed all the Devas to give all their auspicious\nornaments and weapons, He said :-- \xc2\x93O Devas! Better give, all you the various\narms and weapons, endowed with strength, created out of your own weapons and\ngive them all today to the Devi.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nHere ends the Eighth Chapter of the Fifth Skandha on the description of the\norigin and the form of the Devi in S'rimad Devi Bhagavatam, the Maha Pura _n_\nam, of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 9](bk05ch09.htm)\n\n"
