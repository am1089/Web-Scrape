Narada approached Sanatkumara and said, 'Teach me, Sir!' Sanatkumara said\nto him: 'Please to tell me what you know; afterward I shall tell you what is\nbeyond.'\n\n2\\. Narada said: 'I know the Rig-veda, Sir, the Ya _g_ ur-veda, the Sama-veda,\nas the fourth the \xc3\x82tharva _n_ a, as the fifth the Itihasa-pura _n_ a (the\nBharata); the Veda of the Vedas (grammar); the Pitrya (the rules for the\nsacrifices for the ancestors); the Ra _s_ i (the science of numbers); the\nDaiva (the science of portents); the Nidhi (the science of time); the\nVakovakya (logic); the Ekayana (ethics); the Deva-vidya (etymology); the\nBrahma-vidya (pronunciation, _s_ iksha, ceremonial, kalpa, prosody, _kh_\nandas); the Bhuta-vidya (the science of demons); the Kshatra-vidya\n\np. 110\n\n[paragraph continues] (the science of weapons); the Nakshatra-vidya\n(astronomy); the Sarpa and Deva _g_ ana-vidya (the science of serpents or\npoisons, and the sciences of the genii, such as the making of perfumes,\ndancing, singing, playing, and other fine arts) 1. All this I know, Sir.\n\n3\\. 'But, Sir, with all this I know the Mantras only, the sacred books, I do\nnot know the Self. I have heard from men like you, that he who knows the Self\novercomes grief. I am in grief. Do, Sir, help me over this grief of mine.'\n\nSanatkumara, said to him: 'Whatever you have read, is only a name.\n\n4\\. 'A name is the Rig-veda, Ya _g_ ur-veda, Sama-veda, and as the fourth the\n\xc3\x82tharvana, as the fifth the Itihasa-pura _n_ a, the Veda of the Vedas, the\nPitrya, the Ra _s_ i, the Daiva, the Nidhi, the Vakovakya, the Ekayana, the\nDeva-vidya, the Brahma-vidya, the Bhuta-vidya, the Kshatra-vidya, the\nNakshatra-vidya, the Sarpa and Devagana-vidya. All these are a name only.\nMeditate on the name.\n\n5\\. 'He who meditates on the name as Brahman 2,\n\np. 111\n\nis, as it were, lord and master as far as the name reaches-he who meditates on\nthe name as Brahman.'\n\n'Sir, is there something better than a name?'\n\n'Yes, there is something better than a name.'\n\n'Sir, tell it me.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[110:1](sbe01135.htm#fr_302) This passage, exhibiting the sacred literature as\nknown at the time, should be compared with the B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, II, 4,\n10. The explanation of the old titles rests on the authority of _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara,\nand he is not always consistent. See Colebrooke, Miscellaneous Essays, 1873,\n11, p. 10.\n\n[110:2](sbe01135.htm#fr_303) Why a man who knows the Veda should not know the\nSelf, while in other places it is said that the Veda teaches the Self, is well\nillustrated by the commentary. If a royal procession approaches, he says,\nthen, though. we do not see the king, because he is hidden by flags, parasols,\n&c., yet we say, there is the king. And if we ask who is the king, then again,\nthough we cannot see him and point him out, we can say, at least, that he is\ndifferent from all that is seen. The Self is hidden in the Veda as a king is\nhidden in a royal procession.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII, 2](sbe01136.htm)\n\n"
