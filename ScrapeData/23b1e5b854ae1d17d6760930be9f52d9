THE NRISINGHA OR MAN-LION AVAT\xc4\x80RA.\n\nIn the account of the preceding incarnation, it was stated that Vishnu, ere he\nraised the earth on his tusk, slew a demon named Hirany\xc4\x81ksha. This daitya had\na\n\n[![THE NRISINGHA AVAT\xc4\x80RA.](tn/14900.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/14900.jpg)  \nTHE NRISINGHA AVAT\xc4\x80RA.  \n\nbrother named Hiranyakasipu, who, the "V\xc4\x81yu Pur\xc4\x81na" says, had obtained a boon\nfrom Brahm\xc4\x81, that he should not be slain by any created being; the "K\xc5\xabrma\nPur\xc4\x81na" adds, excepting Vishnu. When therefore his pride,\n\np. 150\n\nfostered by his supposed immunity from danger, had led him to great excesses,\nso that his death was desired both by gods and men, Vishnu descended in the\nform of a living being, half-man and half-lion, and so neither man nor animal,\nand slew him. By the assumption of this form the _letter_ of Brahm\xc4\x81\'s promise\nwas kept. The story of the demon\'s hatred of the deity, because in a former\nincarnation he had slain his brother, is a most interesting one. And as it\nteaches the wonderful efficacy of Vishnu\'s worship, it is given at some\nlength. It is taken mostly from the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na." *\n\n"Hiranyakasipu, the son of Diti, had formerly brought the three worlds under\nhis authority, confiding in a boon bestowed upon him by Brahm\xc4\x81,. He had\nusurped the sovereignty of Indra, and exercised himself the functions of the\nsun, of air, of the lord of waters, of fire, and of the moon. He himself was\nthe god of riches; he was the judge of the dead; and he appropriated to\nhimself without reserve all that was offered in sacrifice to the gods. The\ndeities, therefore, flying from their seats in heaven, wandered, through fear\nof the daitya, upon the earth, disguised in mortal shapes. Having conquered\nthe three worlds, he was inflated with pride, and, eulogized by the\nGandharvas, enjoyed whatever he desired."\n\nThis demon had a son named Prahl\xc4\x81da, who was a very devout worshipper of\nVishnu, whom his father hated most intensely. "On one occasion Prahl\xc4\x81da came,\naccompanied by his teacher, to the court of his father, and bowed himself\nbefore his feet as he was drinking. Hiranyakasipu desired his prostrate son to\nrise, and said to him, \'Repeat in substance and agreeably what during the\nperiod of your studies you have acquired.\' Prahl\xc4\x81da said, \'I have learned to\nadmire him who is without\n\np. 151\n\nbeginning, middle, or end, increase or diminution; the imperishable lord of\nthe world, the universal cause of causes.\' On hearing these words, the\nsovereign of the daityas, his eyes red with wrath and his lips swollen with\nindignation, turned to the preceptor of his son, and said, \'Vile Br\xc4\x81hman! what\nis this preposterous commendation of my foe that, in disrespect to me, you\nhave taught this boy to utter?\' \'Phe preceptor denies the charge, and Prahl\xc4\x81da\nhimself replies, \'Vishnu is the instructor of the whole world; what else\nshould any one learn or teach, save him, the supreme spirit? \' \'Blockhead!\'\nexclaimed the king, \'who is this Vishnu, whose name you thus reiterate so\nimpertinently before me, who am the sovereign of the three worlds?\' \'The glory\nof Vishnu,\' replied Prahl\xc4\x81da, \'is to be meditated upon by the devout; it\ncannot be described; he is the supreme lord, who is all things, and from whom\nall things proceed.\' The king threatens death; but the son says, \'Vishnu is\nthe creator and protector not of me alone, but of all human beings, and even,\nfather, of you.\' The father can bear this no longer, so orders his son to\nreturn to his preceptor\'s house.\n\n"Prahl\xc4\x81da is taken away, but after a time is sent for again. When requested to\nrecite some poetry, he commenced to sing the praises of Vishnu, which so\nexasperated the king, that he cried out, \'Kill the wretch! He is not fit to\nlive who is a traitor to his friends, a burning brand to his own race.\' Upon\nthis the attendants rushed upon Prahl\xc4\x81da with their weapons, and, though\nhundreds struck him, none could injure him. His father then entreated him to\ndesist from praising Vishnu; but this the son would not do, as he said he bad\nno fear, as long as his immortal guardian against all dangers was present in\nhis mind.\'\n\np. 152\n\n"Hiranyakasipu, highly exasperated, commanded the serpents to fall upon his\ndisobedient and insane son, and bite him to death. The serpents did their\nworst, but Prahl\xc4\x81da felt them not. The snakes cried out to the king, \'Our\nfangs are broken; our jewelled crests are burst; there is fever in our hoods,\nand fear in our hearts; but the skin of the youth is still unscathed. Have\nrecourse, O king of the daityas? to some other expedient.\'\n\n"The young prince" (by his father\'s orders) "was then assailed by the\nelephants of the skies, as vast as mountain peaks; cast down upon the earth,\nand trampled on and gored by their tusks; but he continued to meditate on\nGovinda, and the tusks of the elephants were blunted against his breast.\n\n"Failing in this, the king said, \'Let fire consume him; and do thou, deity of\nthe winds, blow up the fire, that this wicked wretch may be consumed.\' And the\nd\xc4\x81navas piled a mighty heap of wood around the prince, and kindled a fire to\nburn him, as their master had commanded. But Prahl\xc4\x81da cried, \'Father, this\nfire, though blown by the winds, burneth me not; and all around I behold the\nface of the skies, cool and fragrant with beds of lotus flowers.\'\n\n"The Br\xc4\x81hmans now interceded with the king on the prince\'s behalf, promising\neither to teach him to recant his errors, or to find some means of\naccomplishing his death; but instead of profiting by their instructions, he\nspends his time in speaking to all about him of the glory of Vishnu and the\nhappiness of his worshippers. They informed the king of their failure to bring\nthe prince to a right state of mind; whereupon the cooks are ordered to mix\npoison with his food. But this expedient was futile, as the others had been.\nThe\n\np. 153\n\n[paragraph continues] Br\xc4\x81hmans now reason with him, and try to show him that\nit is the chief duty of a son to honour his father; but their sophistry is\nunsuccessful. They remind him that they had promised to use incantations to\naccomplish his death. This menace he meets with these words: \'What living\ncreature slays or is slain? What living creature preserves or is preserved?\nEach is his own destroyer or preserver as he follows evil or good.\' Enraged by\nthis reply, they now produce a magical female figure, enwreathed in a flame of\nfire, whose tread parched the earth, and who struck Prahl\xc4\x81da upon the breast.\nHer blow fell harmless upon him; but turning towards the Br\xc4\x81hmans, she slew\nthem all, and disappeared. In answer to the prince\'s prayer, they were,\nhowever, restored to life, and, having blessed Prahl\xc4\x81da, departed and told the\nking all that had happened.\n\n"Having sent for his son, Hiranyakasipu inquired again, by what magical art he\nwas able thus to protect himself. Prahl\xc4\x81da said that it was not by magic at\nall, but simply by the indwelling of Vishnu that he was able to ward off evil;\nand further that the same power was within the reach of all who would trust\nhim. The king, enraged at this avowal, commanded his attendants to cast his\nson from the summit of the palace where he was sitting, and which was many\nyojans in height, upon the tops of the mountains, where his body would be\ndashed to pieces against the rocks. Accordingly the daityas hurled the boy\ndown, but as he fell cherishing Hari in his heart, Earth, the nurse of all\ncreatures, received him gently in her lap, thus entirely devoted to Kesava,\nthe protector of the world."\n\nHiranyakasipu, seeing that this fall had not injured his son in any way, asks\nSamvara, the mightiest of enchanters, to try his hand; but though he puts\nforth\n\np. 154\n\nall his skill, the boy remains unhurt. After this, the prince goes again to\nhis preceptor\'s house, where he is instructed in politics. When his education\nin this science was completed, he is taken to the king for examination; but on\nbeing questioned as to his mode of government, he admits that though he has\nbeen instructed in these subjects, he does not approve of what his teachers\nhad said, and again sings the praises of Vishnu. His father, "burning with\nrage, exclaimed, Bind him with strong bands and cast him into the ocean. Death\nis the just retribution of the disobedient.\' The daityas bound the prince with\nstrong bands, as their lord had commanded, and threw him into the sea. As he\nfloated on the waters, the ocean was convulsed throughout its whole extent,\nand rose in mighty indulations, threatening to submerge the earth. When\nHiranyakasipu observed this, he commanded the daityas to hurl rocks into the\nsea, and pile them closely on one another, burying beneath their incumbent\nmass him whom fire could not burn. . . . \'Here, since he cannot die, let him\nlive for thousands of years at the bottom of the ocean, overwhelmed by\nmountains.\' This was done. But Prahl\xc4\x81da was uninjured. His mind was filled\nwith thoughts of Hari, and he came to recognize his real identity with Vishnu.\nAs soon as Prahl\xc4\x81da, through the force of contemplation, had become one with\nVishnu, the bands with which he was bound burst instantly asunder. Prahl\xc4\x81da,\nafter hymning the praises of Vishnu, again returns to his father, who no\nsooner saw him, than he kissed him on the forehead, embraced him, and shed\ntears, and said, \'Dost thou live, my son?\'"\n\nFor a time there was complete reconciliation between them. And only in a very\ncursory manner does the\n\np. 155\n\n[paragraph continues] "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na" allude to the death of Hiranyakasipu.\nAfter speaking of the reconciliation between the father and son, without any\nintimation of further dispute, it goes on to say: "After his father had been\nput to death by Vishnu in the form of the man-lion, Prahl\xc4\x81da became the\nsovereign of the daityas." In the Bh\xc4\x81gavat we are told that Prahl\xc4\x81da had said\nthat Vishnu was in him, in his father; in fact, was everywhere. "Hiranyakasipu\nsays, \'Why, if Vishnu is everywhere, is he not visible in this pillar?\' Being\ntold that Vishnu, though unseen, was really present there, he struck the\npillar, saying, Then I will kill him.\' Immediately Vishnu, in the form of a\nbeing half-man and half-lion, came forth from the pillar, laid hold of\nHiranyakasipu by the thighs with his teeth, and tore him up the middle.\nBrahm\xc4\x81\'s boon to this daitya king, as a reward of his religious observances,\nwas that no common animal should destroy him, that he should die neither in\nthe day nor night, in earth or in heaven, by fire, by water, or by the sword.\nThis promise was kept in the letter, for it was evening when Vishnu slew him;\nthis is neither day nor night. It was done under the droppings of the thatch,\nand this, according to a Hindu proverb, is out of the earth, and he was not\nkilled by a man or an ordinary animal."
