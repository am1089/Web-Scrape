Then the Saint _S_ akayanya, well pleased, said to the King: \'Great King B\n_ri_ hadratha, thou banner of the race of Ikshvaku, quickly obtaining a\nknowledge of Self, thou art happy, and art renowned by the name of Marut, the\nwind 1. This indeed is thy Self 2.\'\n\n\'Which 3, O Saint,\' said the King.\n\nThen the Saint said to him:\n\n2\\. \'He 4 who, without stopping the out-breathing 5, proceeds upwards (from\nthe sthula to the sukshma _s_ arira), and who, modified (by impressions), and\nyet not modified 6, drives away the darkness (of error), he is the Self. Thus\nsaid the Saint Maitri 7.\' And _S_ akayanya said to the King B _ri_ hadratha:\n\'He who in perfect rest, rising from this body (both from the sthula and\nsukshma), and reaching the highest\n\np. 291\n\nlight 1, comes forth in his own form, he is the Self 2 (thus said _S_\nakayanya); this is the immortal, the fearless, this is Brahman.\'\n\n3\\. \'Now then this is the science of Brahman, and the science of all\nUpanishads, O King, which was told us by the Saint Maitri 3. I shall tell it\nto thee:\n\n\'We hear (in the sacred records) that there were once the Valakhilyas 4, who\nhad left off all evil, who were vigorous and passionless. They said to the Pra\n_g_ apati Kratu: "O Saint, this body is without intelligence, like a cart. To\nwhat supernatural being belongs this great power by which such a body has been\nmade intelligent? Or who is the driver? What thou knowest, O Saint, tell us\nthat 5."\' Pra _g_ apati answered and said:\n\n4\\. \'He who in the Sruti is called "Standing above," like passionless ascetics\n6 amidst the objects of the world, he, indeed, the pure, clean, undeveloped,\ntranquil, breathless, bodiless 7, endless, imperishable, firm, everlasting,\nunborn, independent one, stands in his own greatness, and by him has this body\nbeen made intelligent, and he is also the driver of it.\'\n\np. 292\n\nThey said: \'O Saint, How has this been made intelligent by such a being as\nthis which has no desires 1, and how is he its driver?\' He answered them and\nsaid:\n\n5\\. \'That Self which is very small, invisible, incomprehensible, called\nPurusha, dwells of his own will here in part 2; just as a man who is fast\nasleep awakes of his own will 3. And this part (of the Self) which is entirely\nintelligent, reflected in man (as the sun in different vessels of water),\nknowing the body (kshetra _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a), attested by his conceiving, willing, and\nbelieving 4, is Pra _g_ apati (lord of creatures), called Vi _s_ va. By him,\nthe intelligent, is this body made intelligent, and he is the driver thereof.\'\n\nThey said to him: \'O Saint 5, if this has been made intelligent by such a\nbeing as this, which has no desires, and if he is the driver thereof, how was\nit?\' He answered them and said:\n\n6\\. \'In the beginning Pra _g_ apati (the lord of creatures) stood alone. He\nhad no happiness, when alone. Meditating 6 on himself, he created many\n\np. 293\n\ncreatures. He looked on them and saw they were, like a stone, without\nunderstanding, and standing like a lifeless post. He had no happiness. He\nthought, I shall enter 1 within, that they may awake. Making himself like air\n(vayu) 2 he entered within. Being one, he could not do it. Then dividing\nhimself fivefold, he is called Pra _n_ a, Apana, Samana, Udana, Vyana. Now\nthat 3 air which rises upwards, is Pra _n_ a. That which moves downwards, is\nApana. That by which these two are supposed to be held, is Vyana. That 4 which\ncarries the grosser material of food to the Apana, and brings the subtler\nmaterial to each limb, has the name Samana. [After these (Pra _n_ a, Apana,\nSamana) comes the work of the Vyana, and between them (the Pra _n_ a, Apana,\nand Samana on one side and the Vyana on the other) comes the rising of the\nUdana.] That which brings up or carries down 5 what has been drunk and eaten,\nis the Udana 6.\n\nNow the Upa _m_ su-vessel (or pra _n_ a) depends on the Antaryama-vessel\n(apana) and the Antaryama-vessel\n\np. 294\n\n[paragraph continues] (apana) on the Upa _m_ su-vessel 1 (pra _n_ a), and\nbetween these two the self-resplendent (Self) produced heat 2. This heat is\nthe purusha (person), and this purusha is Agni Vai _s_ vanara. And thus it is\nsaid elsewhere 3: "Agni Vai _s_ vanara is the fire within man by which the\nfood that is eaten is cooked, i.e. digested. Its noise is that which one\nhears, if one covers one\'s ears. When a man is on the point of departing this\nlife, he does not hear that noise."\n\nNow he 4, having divided himself fivefold, is hidden in a secret place\n(buddhi), assuming the nature of mind, having the pra _n_ as as his body,\nresplendent, having true concepts, and free like ether 5. Feeling even thus\nthat he has not attained his object, he thinks from within the interior of the\nheart 6, "Let me enjoy objects." Therefore, having first broken open these\nfive apertures (of the senses), he enjoys the objects by means of the five\nreins. This means that these perceptive organs (ear, skin, eye, tongue, nose)\nare his reins; the active organs (tongue (for speaking), hands, feet, anus,\ngenerative organ) his horses; the body his chariot, the mind the charioteer,\nthe whip being the temperament. Driven by that whip, this body goes round like\nthe\n\np. 295\n\nwheel driven by the potter. This body is made intelligent, and he is the\ndriver thereof.\n\nThis 1 is indeed the Self, who seeming to be filled with desires, and seeming\nto be overcome 2 by bright or dark fruits of action, wanders about in every\nbody (himself remaining free). Because he is not manifest, because he is\ninfinitely small, because he is invisible, because he cannot be grasped,\nbecause he is attached to nothing, therefore he, seeming to be changing, an\nagent in that which is not (prak _ri_ ti), is in reality not an agent and\nunchanging. He is pure, firm, stable, undefiled 3, unmoved, free from desire,\nremaining a spectator, resting in himself Having concealed himself in the\ncloak of the three qualities he appears as the enjoyer of _ri_ ta, as the\nenjoyer of _ri_ ta (of his good works).\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[290:1](sbe15113.htm#fr_944) P _ri_ shada _s_ va in the Veda is another name\nof the Maruts, the storm gods. Afterwards the king is called Marut, VI, 30.\n\n[290:2](sbe15113.htm#fr_945) This sentence is called a Sutra by the\ncommentator to VI, 32.\n\n[290:3](sbe15113.htm#fr_946) M. reads Kathaya me katamo bhavan iti.\n\n[290:4](sbe15113.htm#fr_947) M. leaves out atha.\n\n[290:5](sbe15113.htm#fr_948) One might read avish _t_ ambhanena, in the sense\nof while preventing the departure of the vital breath, as in the B _ri_ h. \xc3\x82r.\nVI, 3, pra _n_ ena rakshann avaram kulayam.\n\n[290:6](sbe15113.htm#fr_949) M. reads vyathamano \'vyathamanas.\n\n[290:7](sbe15113.htm#fr_950) M. leaves out Maitri _h_ -ity eva _m_ hyaha. The\ncommentator explains Maitrir by mitraya apatyam _ri_ shir maitrir maitreya. In\na later passage (II, 3) M. reads Bhagavata Maitre _n_ a, likewise the\nAnubhutipraka _s_ a.\n\n[291:1](sbe15113.htm#fr_951) M. adds svaya _m_ gyotir upasampadya.\n\n[291:2](sbe15113.htm#fr_952) M. reads esha for ity esha, which seems better.\n\n[291:3](sbe15113.htm#fr_953) M. reads Maitre _n_ a vyakhyata.\n\n[291:4](sbe15113.htm#fr_954) M. M., Translation of Rig-veda, Preface, p.\nxxxiv.\n\n[291:5](sbe15113.htm#fr_955) M. adds: bruhiti te ho _k_ ur Bhagavan katham\nanena vasya _m_ yat Bhagavan vetsy etad asmaka _m_ bruhiti tan hova _k_ eti.\n\n[291:6](sbe15113.htm#fr_956) The commentator allows utrdhvaretasasa _h_ to be\ntaken as a vocative also.\n\n[291:7](sbe15113.htm#fr_957) Niratma is explained by the commentator as\nthoughtless, without volition, &c. But atma is frequently used for body also,\nand this seems more appropriate here. M., however, reads ani _s_ atma, and\nthis is the reading explained in the Anubhutipraka _s_ a, p. 228, ver. 60.\nThis might mean the \xc3\x82tman which has not yet assumed the quality of a personal\ngod. See VI, 28; VI, 31.\n\n[292:1](sbe15113.htm#fr_958) The reading anish _th_ ena is explained by the\ncommentator as free from any local habitation or attachment. He also mentions\nthe various readings anish _t_ ena, free from wishes, and anish _th_ ena, the\nsmallest. M. reads ani _k_ _kh_ ena, and this seems better than anish _t_ ena.\nThe Anubhutipraka _s_ a reads likewise ani _k_ _kh_ asya.\n\n[292:2](sbe15113.htm#fr_959) I read buddhipurvam, and again with M. suptasyeva\nbuddhipurvam. I also read a _m_ sena without iti, as in M. The simile seems to\nbe that a man, if he likes, can wake himself at any time of night, and this\n\'if he likes\' is expressed by buddhipurvam. See Anubhutipraka _s_ a, vv. 67,\n68.\n\n[292:3](sbe15113.htm#fr_960) M. reads vibodhayati, atha.\n\n[292:4](sbe15113.htm#fr_961) See Maitr. Up. V, 2; Cowell\'s Translation, pp.\n246, 256; Vedantaparibhasha, ed. A. Venis, in the Pandit, IV, p. 100.\n\n[292:5](sbe15113.htm#fr_962) M. adds: bhagavann id _ri_ _s_ asya katham a _m_\n_s_ ena vartanam iti tan hova _k_ a.\n\n[292:6](sbe15113.htm#fr_963) AT. reads abhidhyayan.\n\n[293:1](sbe15113.htm#fr_964) It is better to read with M. vi _s_ aniti.\n\n[293:2](sbe15113.htm#fr_965) M. vayum iva.\n\n[293:3](sbe15113.htm#fr_966) M. Atha yo \'yam.\n\n[293:4](sbe15113.htm#fr_967) M. reads: yo \'ya _m_ sthavish _th_ am anna _m_\ndhatum annasyapane sthapayaty a _n_ ish _th_ a _m_ _k_ a\xe1\xb9\x85ge \'\xe1\xb9\x85ge sa _m_ nayati\nesha vava sa samano \'tha yo \'yam. Leaving, out annam, this seems the right\nreading. The whole sentence from uttaram to udanasya is left out in M.\n\n[293:5](sbe15113.htm#fr_968) M. nigirati _k_ aisho vava sa udano \'tha yenaitas\nsira anuvyapta esha vava sa vyana _h_.\n\n[293:6](sbe15113.htm#fr_969) The views of these five kinds of wind differ\nconsiderably. Here the commentator explains that the pra _n_ a and apana, the\nup-breathing and down-breathing, keep the bodily warmth alive, as bellows keep\nup a fire. The food cooked in it is distributed by the Samana, so that the\ncoarse material becomes ordure, the middle flesh, the subtle material mind\n(manas). The udana brings up phlegm, &c., while the Vyana gives strength to\nthe whole body.\n\n[294:1](sbe15113.htm#fr_970) Two sacrificial vessels (graha) placed on either\nside of the stone on which the Soma is squeezed, and here compared to the Pra\n_n_ a and Apana, between which the Self ( _k_ aitanyatma) assumes heat.\n\n[294:2](sbe15113.htm#fr_971) M. reads tayor antara _l_ e _k_ aush _n_ yam\nprasuvat.\n\n[294:3](sbe15113.htm#fr_972) See B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka Up. V, 9; _Kh_ and.\nUp. III, 13, 8.\n\n[294:4](sbe15113.htm#fr_973) The Vai _s_ vanara or purusha, according to the\ncommentator, but originally the Pra _g_ apati, who had made himself like air,\nand divided himself into five vital airs.\n\n[294:5](sbe15113.htm#fr_974) Thus the atma, with his own qualities and those\nwhich he assumes, becomes a living being.\n\n[294:6](sbe15113.htm#fr_975) M. reads esho \'sya h _ri_ dantare tish _th_ ann.\n\n[295:1](sbe15113.htm#fr_976) M. reads: Sa va esha atmeti ho _s_ ann iva\nsitasitai _h_. This seems better than u _s_ anti kavaya _h_ , which hardly\nconstrues.\n\n[295:2](sbe15113.htm#fr_977) M. reads abhibhuyamanay iva, which again is\nbetter than anabhibhuta iva, for he seems to be overcome, but is not, just as\nhe seems to be an agent, but is not. See also III, 1.\n\n[295:3](sbe15113.htm#fr_978) M. has alepo.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Third Prapathaka](sbe15114.htm)\n\n'
