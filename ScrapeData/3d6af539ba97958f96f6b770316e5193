Lo, that beautiful splendour of the god, when he was born of strength, has\ntruly come to be a wondrous sight. Though he slinks away\n[1](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:1:1), the prayer goes straight to him\n[2](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:1:2). They have led forward the flowing streams of\n_Ri_ ta.\n\n2\\. The powerful one [1](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:2:1), rich in food, the true\n(friend of men) has entered the wondrous (body)\n[2](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:2:2). His second (form of existence) is in the seven\nkind mothers [3](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:2:3). The ten young females\n[4](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:2:4) have brought the third (form) of this bull\nforth, him the guardian, in order to milk him.\n\n3\\. When the rulers, the liberal lords brought him forth by their power out of\nthe depth, out of the buffalo's shape [1](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:3:1), when\nfrom of old [2](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:3:2) at the purification of the sweet\ndrink [3](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:3:3) Matari _s_ van produces the hidden one\n(i. e. Agni) by attrition--\n\n4\\. When he is led forward from the highest father\n[1](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:4:1), he climbs up the \xe2\x80\xa6\n[2](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:4:2), the plants in his (or, in their?) houses. When\n[3](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:4:3) both (Heaven and Earth or the two Ara _n_ is?)\npromote his birth, then the youngest one became bright by his heat\n[4](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:4:4).\n\n5\\. Then he entered upon the mothers [1](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:5:1) in whom he\nthe bright one grew up far and wide unimpaired [2](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:5:2).\nWhen he has climbed up to the former (mothers) who from of old incite (him)\n[3](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:5:3), he runs down in the younger, later (or,\nnearer) ones.\n\n6 [1](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:6:1). Then in the strivings for the day\n[2](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:6:2) they choose him Hot _ri_. As if to swell their\ngood fortune they\n\np. 148\n\nstrive towards him [3](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:6:3), when praised by many he\nmoves everywhere with wisdom and power to the gods and to the praise of\nmortals [4](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:6:4) for (bringing them) refreshing drink.\n\n7\\. When he has scattered himself, the worshipful one, driven by the wind,\nlike \xe2\x80\xa6 [1](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:7:1), with the sound (which he produces) (?),\nhe whom it is not possible to drive to a place (like cattle): on the flight of\nthe burning one who speeds on his black way, whose birth is bright, who strays\neverywhere to the atmosphere \xe2\x80\xa6 [2](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:7:2).\n\n8\\. Like a chariot that goes forward, he goes to Heaven with his ruddy limbs,\nadorned with his locks of flames [1](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:8:1). Then his\nblack (clouds of smoke), O burning one (?), the liberal ones (?) (appear)\n[2](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:8:2). The birds flee as before the fierceness of a\nhero [3](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:8:3).\n\n9\\. Through thee indeed, O Agni, Varu _n_ a whose laws are firm, Mitra and\nAryaman, the givers of good rain, are glorious, when thou the mighty one hast\nbeen born, everywhere encompassing with wisdom (all beings), as the felly\nencompasses the spokes of a wheel.\n\n10\\. Thou, O Agni, youngest (god), furtherest treasures and (the friendship\nof) the gods for him who performs worship, who presses Soma. May we thus\nestablish thee the young one, O young (son) of strength, possessor of great\ntreasures, like the winner in a race [1](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:10:1).\n\n11\\. Make good fortune [1](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:11:1) swell for us like well-\nemployed wealth belonging to the house, and like firm ability\n[2](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:11:2)--(fortune) which can hold both races\n[3](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:11:3) like reins: and being full-of good-will in\n(the sphere of) _Ri_ ta, (fill our) praise of the gods (with rich reward).\n\np. 149\n\n12\\. And may the brilliant, joyful Hot _ri_ with quick horses, with a shining\nchariot hear us. May he, the wise Agni, lead us on the best leading (paths) to\nhappy welfare and to bliss.\n\n13\\. Agni has been praised with powerful [1](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:13:1)\nsongs, he who has been brought forward furthermore for sovereignty. May both\nthose our liberal lords and we ourselves spread out\n[2](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:13:2) (our power over all foes) as the sun (spreads\nout its light and by it destroys) the mist.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi. The metre is _G_ agati; the two last verses again are Trish\n_t_ ubh.--None of its verses occurs in the other Sa _m_ hitas.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. The meaning seems to be that if Agni be unwilling to officiate at the\nsacrifice, the prayer nevertheless reaches its aim and induces him to do his\nduty as the divine Hot _ri_.\n\nNote 2. The verb sadh is very frequently connected with substantives such as\ndhiya _h_ or the like. Comp. also matina\xc2\xb4m _k_ a sa\xc2\xb4dhanam, X, 26, 4.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. It seems probable that p _ri_ ksha _h_ is the nominative of p _ri_\nksha, and not the genitive of p _ri_ ksh. Comp. VI, 8, 1, where it is said of\nAgni 'p _ri_ kshasya v _r i_sh _n_ a _h_ arushasya.' On the meaning of p _ri_\nksha, see above, I, 127, 5, note 1.\n\nNote 2. The poet seems clearly to describe the second and third form of Agni's\nexistence, his dwelling in the waters and his birth from the fire-sticks. But\nhe is less explicit with regard to the first form. The epithet pituma\xc2\xb4n\n\np. 150\n\nwould seem to point to Agni as the sacrificial fire and the receiver of\nofferings. But it is rather strange that this form of the god should be\ndistinguished from the Agni procreated by the ten females, i. e. produced by\nthe ten fingers, by the attrition of the kindling-sticks.--Prof. Max Muller\ndiffers from me in referring the words da _s_ apramatim _g_ anayanta yosha _n_\na _h_ , not to the third form of Agni, but to Agni in general. He translates:\n'The powerful one, rich in food, rests always on that wondrous sight (Agni on\nthe altar, garhapatya Agni). The second rests in the seven kind mothers\n(vidyudrupa; Agni in the clouds); the third is for milking the powerful one\n(Agni as the sun, adityarupa)--the ten maidens (the fingers) have brought\nforth the guardian.'\n\nNote 3. Grassmann no doubt is right in proposing to read sapta _s_ iva\xc2\xb4su. Of\ncourse the waters are alluded to.\n\nNote 4. Read da _s_ a pramatim (Boehtlingk-Roth). On Agni as the son of the\nten fingers, comp. Bergaigne, II, 7.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. The buffalo Agni was hidden in the depth. Comp. X, 8, 1. apa\xc2\xb4m upa-\nsthe mahisha _h_ vavardha; I, 95, 9. budhnam vi-ro _k_ amanam mahishasya\ndha\xc2\xb4ma.\n\nNote 2. The preposition anu seems to stand here with an ablative (pra-diva _h_\n).\n\nNote 3. The literal meaning of madhva _h_ a-dhave is indicated by passages\nsuch as I, 109, 4. a\xc2\xb4 dhavatam madhuna; IX, 11, 5. madhav a\xc2\xb4 dhavata madhu.\nComp. also adhavaniya. On the washing of the Soma which is technically\ndesignated by the verb a-dhav, see H. O., Gottinger Gelehrte Anzeigen, 1890,\np. 426 seq.; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, I, 216.--The purification of\nthe sweet drink, at which Agni is produced, was probably achieved by the\ntempest.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. The highest father is Heaven.\n\nNote 2. The meaning of p _ri_ kshudha _h_ is unknown.\n\np. 151\n\nNote 3. Yat is repeated twice, as yasya in X, 121, 2. yasya vi _s_ ve\nupa-a\xc2\xb4sate pra- _s_ isham yasya deva\xc2\xb4 _h_.\n\nNote 4. On gh _ri_ _n_ a\xc2\xb4, comp. Lanman, Noun-Inflection, 335.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. The mothers are the Waters.\n\nNote 2. The reading, very probably, ought to be vivav _ri_ dhe.\n\nNote 3. Boehtlingk-Roth believe that the reading ought to be sanayuva _h_ or\nsana- _g_ ura _h_. Sana- _g_ ura _h_ (cf. sana- _g_ ura pitara, IV, 36, 3)\nseems to me quite possible, although there is no positive necessity for\nabandoning the traditional reading.--The 'former' mothers may be the heavenly\nWaters; the mothers in whom Agni runs down are the rivers. Prof. Max Muller\nadds that the former mothers may possibly be 'the burnt pieces of wood. Agni\nruns up in them, then leaves them to burn new pieces.'\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. On the whole verse, compare Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 217.\n\nNote 2. Comp. above, I, 45, 7, note 1.\n\nNote 3. The second Pada is translated by Pischel: 'Wie in einen Konig drangen\nsie in ihn, wenn sie (Trank)opfer darbringen.' But verse 11 shows that bhagam\ndepends on pap _ri_ _k_ ana\xc2\xb4sa _h_.\n\nNote 4. Comp. III, 16, 4. a\xc2\xb4 deveshu \xe2\x80\xa6 a\xc2\xb4 _s_ a _m_ se uta n _ri_ _n_ a\xc2\xb4m.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. The translation of hvara _h_ is quite uncertain. The same must be said\nof the rest of this Pada.\n\nNote 2. The sentence is incomplete.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. On _s_ ikvan (or _s_ ikvas), comp. M. M.'s note, vol. xxxii, p. 318;\nHubschmann, Vocalsystem, p. 186. The translation is only tentative.--Two\nsyllables are wanting;\n\np. 152\n\nwe may propose a reading like _s_ ikvabhi _h_ parishk _ri_ ta _h_ (comp. H.\nO., Prolegomena, 76, note 3).\n\nNote 2. This passage is most obscure. The first words of the Pada are the same\nas above, 140, 5. The 'black ones' probably are the dark clouds of smoke that\nsurround Agni. But it is very strange that these clouds should be designated\nas suraya _h_ , 'liberal ones.' And the vocative (?) dakshi (Padapa _th_ a\ndhakshi), instead of which we should at least expect daksho or dakshin, is no\nless strange. The text seems thoroughly corrupt.\n\nNote 3. See Lanman, p. 557.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. Comp. Geldner, Vedische Studien, I, 121.\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. Comp. above, verse 6, Pada 2.\n\nNote 2. Comp. VIII, 24, 14. daksham p _ri_ _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ antam.\n\nNote 3. The human and the divine race. I do not believe that Dr. Neisser (Zur\nVedischen Verballehre, 17) is right in interpreting yamati as an indicative.\n\n##### Verse 13.\n\nNote 1. The translation of _s_ imivadbhi _h_ is only tentative. _S_ imi (I,\n151, 1) cannot be identical with _s_ ami.\n\nNote 2. Ni _h_ tatanyu _h_ (nish _t_ atanyu _h_ , Sa _m_ hitapa _th_ a) of\ncourse is derived from tan, not from stan. Comp. I, 105, 12. satyam tatana\nsu\xc2\xb4rya _h_ ; IV, 5, 13. su\xc2\xb4ra _h_ var _n_ ena tatanan usha\xc2\xb4sa _h_ , &c.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 142. \xc3\x82pri Hymn](sbe46040.htm)\n\n"
