At the time Shree Krishnu Chund was about to\nbe born, such joy arose in the minds of all men, that the name even of grief\ndid not remain. Through delight the forests and groves being green began to\nproduce flowers and fruits; the rivers, nullahs and ponds to be filled with\nwater; birds of different kinds to sport and hop about; and there were\nrejoicings in every city, village and house; Brahmins offered up sacrifices;\nthe guardians of the ten quarters were delighted; clouds rolled over\nBrujmundul; the gods seated in their chariots rained flowers from the sky, the\ncelestial dancers, musicians, bands, playing upon drums and pipes began to\nsing praises; and in one quarter Oorbusee and all the celestial courtezans\nwere dancing. Under such a combination of circumstances on the eighth of the\ndark part of the month of Bhadon, in the Rohnee division of the zodiack, on a\nWednesday at midnight, Shree Krishnu Jee was born; and being of the colour of\na cloud, with a face like the moon, lotus-eyed, wearing a yellow vest, with a\ncrown on his head, and adorned with the byjuntee--necklace, composed of\njewels, produced from the five elements of nature, and having ornaments\nstudded with jewels, in a form with\n\np. 22\n\nfour arms, holding a shell, quoit, club, and a lotus, he appeared before\nBasoodeo and Dewukee. On seeing him, both being amazed imagined him to be the\nfirst mortal; then joining their hands, they submissively said, "Great is our\ngood fortune, that you have shown yourself to us, and given us a release from\nbirth and death."\n\nHaving thus spoken, they narrated the first part of the history, how Kuns had\ncaused them affliction; upon this, Shree Krishnu Chund, said, "Do not now\nsuffer any anxiety of mind, because I have descended upon the earth to dispel\nyour griefs, but carry me now to Gokool; and at this very time Jusodha has had\na daughter, which take and deliver to Kuns; listen to the reason of my going,\nwhich I will explain. Nund and Jusodha have performed religious penance;\nfixing their affections upon me, they desire to see their child\'s happiness: I\nwill go and stay some days with them. Hereafter, after having killed Kuns, I\nwill return to you: keep up your confidence."\n\nHaving made this explanation to Basoodeo and Dewukee, Shree Krishnu being\ntransformed into an infant, began to cry, and dissipated his delusion--And\nupon this, all the knowledge of Basoodeo and Dewukee departed, and they\nsupposed the infant to be their own son. Thinking thus, and having made a vow\nin their minds to offer up ten thousand cows, they took the child in their\narms and fondled it. On looking at its face, both heaving deep sighs, began to\nsay to each other, "Let us contrive some means of carrying off this infant,\nthat he may escape from the hands of that sinner Kuns." Basoodeo said,\n"Without the assistance of Bruhmu, no one will be able to support him;\nwhatever has been written in fate, that will happen." Then joining. her hands\nJusodha said, "Your friend Nund lives at Gokool:--Jusodha will dispel our\ntroubles, and there is your wife Rohnee.--Take this infant there." On hearing\nthis, Basoodeo said with agitation, "How shall I escape from these strong\n\np. 23\n\nfastenings?" Upon this, all their handcuffs and chains upon their legs fell\noff; the doors flew open on all four sides: the watchmen, off their guard,\nwere fast asleep.\n\nBasoodeo Jee having then placed Shree Krishnu in a basket, put it on his head,\nand went off immediately to Gokool-Above the gods were pouring rain, behind\nhim lions roared. Basoodeo became anxious, on beholding the great stream of\nthe Jumna.\n\nStanding on the bank of the river, Basoodeo began to reflect "that behind\nlions are roaring, and in front the fathomless Jumna is flowing, what shall I\ndo now?" Saying this, and fixing his thoughts upon Bhugwan, he went into the\nJumna; and the depth of the river increased as he advanced. When the water\ncame up to his nose, he was very much frightened-Perceiving that he was\nagitated, Shree Krishnu, extending his foot, uttered the mystical sound, "\n_hoon_ ," and in consequence of the stretching out of his foot, the Jumna\nbecame fordable. Basoodeo having crossed the river, came to Nund\'s house, and\nfound the doors open; on going in, he found all asleep. Dewee had thrown her\ninto such a trance, that Jusodha was not conscious of having been delivered of\na girl. Basoodeo, having put Krishnu asleep by the side of Jusodha, and taken\naway her infant daughter, quickly returned homeward. After re-crossing the\nriver, he came to the spot where Dewukee was sitting in anxious thought.\nHaving given her the little girl, he told her all the news of his journey. On\nhearing the account, Jusodha, delighted with joy, exclaimed, "O husband! what\nneed we care now, if Kuns should put us to death, since our son has escaped\nfrom the hands of that demon." Having told thus much of the history, Shree\nShookdeo Jee said to the Raja Pureechit, When Basoodeo had brought the female\ninfant, the doors of their prison became closed as before, and both had chains\nand handcuffs fastened on again--the little girl began to cry. On hearing the\nnoise or the crying, the sentinels awoke, and snatching up their arms, and\nbeing on the alert,\n\np. 24\n\nbegan to fire their muskets. On hearing their report, the elephants began to\nscream, lions to roar, and dogs to bark. At this time amidst the darkness of\nnight, and in the rain, a sentinel came, and having joined his hands, said to\nKuns, "O great king! your enemy has been born." On hearing this, Kuns fell\ndown insensible.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter V](psa06.htm)\n\n'
