He shall employ the means which tend to the acquisition of (the knowledge\nof) the \xc3\x82tman, which are attended by the consequent (destruction of the\npassions, and) which prevent the wandering (of the mind from its object, and\nfix it on the contemplation of the \xc3\x82tman). 1\n\n2\\. There is no higher (object) than the attainment of (the knowledge of the)\n\xc3\x82tman. 2\n\n3\\. We shall quote the verses (from the Veda) 3\n\np. 76\n\nwhich refer to the attainment of (the knowledge of) the \xc3\x82tman.\n\n4\\. All living creatures are the dwelling of him who lies enveloped in matter,\nwho is immortal and who is spotless. Those become immortal who worship him who\nis immovable and lives in a movable dwelling. 4\n\n5\\. Despising all that which in this world is called an object (of the senses)\na wise man shall strive after the (knowledge of the) \xc3\x82tman. 5\n\n6\\. O pupil, I, who had not recognised in my own self the great self-luminous,\nuniversal, (absolutely) free \xc3\x82tman, which must be obtained without the\nmediation of anything else, desired (to find) it in others (the senses). (But\nnow as I have obtained the pure knowledge, I do so no more.) Therefore follow\nthou also this good road that leads to welfare (salvation), and not the one\nthat leads into misfortune (new births). 6\n\n7\\. It is he who is the eternal part in all creatures, whose essence is\nwisdom, who is immortal, unchangeable, destitute of limbs, of voice, of the\n(subtle) body, 7\n\np. 77\n\n(even) of touch, exceedingly pure; he is the universe, he is the highest goal;\n(he dwells in the middle of the body as) the Vishuvat day is (the middle of a\nSattra-sacrifice); he, indeed, is (accessible to all) like a town intersected\nby many streets.\n\n8\\. He who meditates on him, and everywhere and always lives according to his\n(commandments), and who, full of devotion, sees him who is difficult to be\nseen and subtle, will rejoice in (his) heaven. 8\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[75:1](sbe0225.htm#fr_445) **22**. The knowledge of the Vedanta and the means\nwhich prepare men for the knowledge of the \xc3\x82tman, the 'Self, the universal\nsoul,' are placed in this Pa _t_ ala at the head of the penances, because they\nare most efficacious for the removal of all sin. The means are absence of\nanger &c., which are enumerated I, 8, 23, 6.\n\n[75:2](sbe0225.htm#fr_446) Haradatta gives in his commentary a lengthy\ndiscussion on the \xc3\x82tman, which corresponds nearly to _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara's Introduction\nto and Commentary on the first Sutra of Badaraya _n_ a.\n\n[75:3](sbe0225.htm#fr_447) According to Haradatta, the following verses are\ntaken from an Upanishad.\n\n[76:4](sbe0225.htm#fr_448) The spotless one &c. is the Paramatman. The spots\nare merit and demerit which, residing in the Manas, the internal organ of\nperception, are only falsely attributed to the \xc3\x82tman, 'the soul.' To become\nimmortal means 'to obtain final liberation.'\n\n[76:5](sbe0225.htm#fr_449) It seems to me that Haradatta's explanation of the\nwords 'idam idi ha idi ha' is wrong. They ought to be divided thus, 'idamid,\niha id, iha loke.' The general sense remains the same, and there is no\nnecessity to assume very curious and otherwise unknown Vedic forms.\n\n[76:6](sbe0225.htm#fr_450) The verse is addressed by a teacher to his pupil.\nMy translation strictly follows Haradatta's gloss. But his interpretation is\nopen to many doubts. However, I am unable to suggest anything better.\n\n[76:7](sbe0225.htm#fr_451) The Sutra contains a further description of the\nParamatman.\n\n[77:8](sbe0225.htm#fr_452) Haradatta explains the word vish _t_ ap, 'heaven,'\nby 'pain-freed greatness,' apparently misled by a bad etymology. The heaven of\nthe \xc3\x82tman is, of course, liberation, that state where the individual soul\nbecomes merged in the Brahman or Paramatman, which is pure essence,\nintelligence and joy.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Pa _t_ ala 8, Kha _n_ _d_ a 23](sbe0226.htm)\n\n"
