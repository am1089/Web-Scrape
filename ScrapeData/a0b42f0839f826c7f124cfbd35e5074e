And on account of desire (being mentioned as belonging to the anandamaya)\nno regard is to be had to what is inferred, (i.e. to the pradhana inferred by\nthe Sa _n_ khyas.)\n\nSince in the passage 'he desired, may I be many, may I grow forth,' which\noccurs in the chapter treating of the anandamaya (Taitt. Up. II, 6), the\nquality of feeling desire is mentioned, that which is inferred, i.e. the non-\nintelligent pradhana assumed by the Sa _n_ khyas, cannot be regarded as being\nthe Self consisting of bliss and the cause of the world. Although the opinion\nthat the pradhana is the\n\np. 71\n\ncause of the world, has already been refuted in the Sutra I, 1, 5, it is here,\nwhere a favourable opportunity presents itself, refuted for a second time on\nthe basis of the scriptural passage about the cause of the world feeling\ndesire, for the purpose of showing the uniformity of view (of all scriptural\npassages).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 1, 19](sbe34025.htm)\n\n"
