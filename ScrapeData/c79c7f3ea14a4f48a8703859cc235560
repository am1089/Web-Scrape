Say  \nHow can my care thy grace repay.'  \nEnvoy of Him whom all adore  \nThus to the king he spake once more:  \n'The Gods accept thy worship: they  \nGive thee the blessed fruit to-day.  \nApproach and take, O glorious King,  \nThis heavenly nectar which I bring,  \nFor it shall give thee sons and wealth,  \nAnd bless thee with a store of health.  \nGive it to those fair queens of thine,  \nAnd bid them quaff the drink divine:  \nAnd they the princely suns shall bear  \nLong sought by sacrifice and prayer.'  \n\n' Yea. O my lord,' the monarch said,  \nAnd took the vase upon his head,  \nThe gift of Gods, of fine gold wrought,  \nWith store of heavenly liquor fraught.  \nHe honoured, filled with transport new,  \nThat wondrous being, fair to view,  \nAs round the envoy of the God  \nWith reverential steps he trod. 1  \n\nHis errand done, that form of light  \nArose and vanished from the sight.  \nHigh rapture filled the monarch's soul,  \nPossessed of that celestial bowl,  \nAs when a man by want distressed  \nWith unexpected wealth is blest.  \nAnd rays of transport seemed to fall  \nIlluminating bower and hall,  \nAs when the autumn moon rides high,  \nAnd floods with lovely light the sky.  \nQuick to the ladies' bower he sped,  \nAnd thus to Queen Kaus'alya said:  \n'This genial nectar take and quaff,'  \nHe spoke, and gave the lady half.  \nPart of the nectar that remained  \nSumitra from his hand obtained.  \nHe gave, to make her fruitful too,  \nKaikeyi half the residue.  \nA portion yet remaining there,  \n   He paused awhile to think.  \nThen gave Sumitra, with her share.  \n   The remnant of the drink.  \nThus on each queen of those fair three  \n   A part the king bestowed,  \nAnd with sweet hope a child to see  \n   Their yearning bosoms glowed.  \nThe heavenly bowl the king supplied  \n   Their longing souls relieved,  \nAnd soon, with rapture and with pride,  \n   Each royal dame conceived.  \nHe gazed upon each lady's face,  \n   And triumphed as he gazed,  \nAs Indra in his royal place  \n   By Gods and spirits praised.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[26:1b](ry017.htm#fr_108) The Horse-Sacrifice, just described.\n\n[27:1](ry017.htm#fr_109) To walk round an object keeping the right side\ntowards it is a mark of great respect. The Sanskrit word for the observance is\n_pradakshin a_, from pra pro, and _daksha_ right, Greek \xce\xb4\xce\xb5\xce\xbe\xce\xaf\xce\xbf\xcf\x82, Latin dexter,\nGaelic *deas-il. A similar ceremony is observed by tha Gaels.\n\n'In the meantime she traced around him, with wavering steps, the propitiation,\nwhich some have thought has been derived from the Druidical mythology. It\nconsists, as is well known, in the person who wakes the _deasil_ walking three\ntimes round the person who is the object of the ceremony, taking care to move\naccording to the course of the sun.'
