In the fourth, or sixth, or eighth month (of her pregnancy).\n\n3. 3 In the morning, after she has been washed, sitting on northward-pointed Darbha grass, (all over her body), including her head, she sits down to the west of the fire on northward-pointed Darbha grass, facing the east.\n\n4. 4 Her husband, standing behind her, ties (to her neck) an Udumbara branch with an even number of unripe fruits on it, with (the verse), 'Rich in sap is this tree' (MB. I, 5, 1).\n\n5\\. He then parts her hair upwards (i.e. beginning from the front), the first\ntime with Darbha blades, with (the word), 'Bhu _h_!' the second time with (the\nword), 'Bhuva _h_!' the third time with (the word), 'Sva _h_!'\xc2\x97\n\n6\\. Then with (a splint of) Viratara (wood) with this verse, 'With which\nAditi's' (ibid. 2);\n\np. 55\n\n7\\. Then with a full spindle, with this verse, 'I invoke Raka' (ibid. 3. 4)\n\n8\\. And with a porcupine's quill that has three white spots, with (the verse),\n'Which are thy blessings, O Raka' (ibid. 5).\n\n9\\. (There should be prepared) a mess of boiled rice with sesamum seeds,\ncovered with ghee; at that he should make her look.\n\n10\\. Let him say to her, 'What dost thou see?' and make her answer,\n'Offspring!'\n\n11\\. That (food) she should eat herself.\n\n12\\. Brahma _n_ a women should sit by her side, pronouncing auspicious words\n(such as), 'A mother of valiant sons! A mother of living sons! A living\nhusband's wife!'\n\n13. 13 Now (follows) the sacrifice for the woman in labour.\n\n14\\. When the child is appearing, he strews (Darbha grass) round the fire and\nsacrifices two \xc3\x82 _g_ ya oblations with this verse, 'She who athwart' (MB. I,\n5, 6), and with (the verse), 'Vipa _s_ _k_ it has taken away' (ibid. 7).\n\n15\\. 'A male he will be born, N.N. by name'\xc2\x97(in this passage of the last\nverse) he pronounces a name.\n\n16\\. What that (name is), is kept secret.\n\n17. 17 When they announce to him that a son has been born, he should say, 'Delay still cutting off the navel-string and giving him the breast.'\n\n18. 18 Let him have rice and barley-grains pounded in the same way as the (Nyagrodha) shoot.\n\np. 56\n\n19. 19 Seizing (that pounded _s_ ubstance) with the thumb and the fourth finger of his right hand, he smears it on the tongue of the boy, with the formula, 'This order' (MB. I, 5, 8).\n\n20\\. In the same way the production of intelligence (is performed). He should\ngive to eat (to the child) clarified butter.\n\n21\\. Or he takes it with gold (i.e. with a golden spoon) and sacrifices it on\nthe face of the boy with this verse, 'May Mitra and Varu _n_ a bestow\nintelligence on thee' (MB. I, 5, 9), and with (the verse), 'The lord of the\nseat, the wonderful' (Sama-veda I, 171).\n\n22\\. Let him say, 'Cut off the navel-string,' and, 'Give the breast (to the\nchild).'\n\n23. 23 From that time let him not touch (his wife) until ten nights have passed.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[54:1](sbe30019.htm#fr_223) 7, 1. seq.
