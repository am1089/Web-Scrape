If it be said that purposelessness (of conduct would result therefrom),\nwe deny this on account of the dependence (of work) on that (conduct).\n\nThat may be; but for what reason should we abandon that meaning which the term\n' _k_ ara _n_ a' directly conveys, viz. the meaning 'conduct,' and accept the\nmerely connotative meaning 'remainder of the works?' Conduct, which the text\ndirectly mentions, may be supposed to have for its fruit either a good or an\nevil birth, according as it is enjoined or prohibited, good or evil. Some\nfruit will have to be allowed to it in any case; for otherwise it would follow\nthat it is purposeless.--This objection is without force 'on account of the\ndependence on it.' Such works as sacrifices, and the like, depend on conduct\nin so far as somebody whose conduct is not good is not entitled to perform\nthem. This we know from Sm _ri_ ti-passages, such as the following, 'Him who\nis devoid of good conduct the Vedas do not purify.'--And also if conduct is\nconsidered as subservient to man 1 it will not be purposeless. For when the\naggregate of works such as sacrifices, &c.. begins to originate its fruit, the\nconduct which has reference to the sacrifice will originate there (i.e. in the\nfruit) some addition.\n\np. 121\n\n[paragraph continues] And it is known from _S_ ruti as well as Sm _ri_ ti that\nwork effects everything 1. It is, therefore, the opinion of Karsh _n_ a _g_\nini that the remainder of works only--which is connoted by the term 'conduct'\n--is the cause of the souls entering on new births. For as work may be the\ncause of new births, it is not proper to assume that conduct is the cause. If\na man is able to run away by means of his feet he will surely not creep on his\nknees.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[120:1](sbe38086.htm#fr_94) I.e. as something which produces in man a sa _m_\nskara analogous to that produced by other preparatory or purificatory rites\nsuch as bathing, &c.--In the preceding sentences conduct had been spoken of\nnot as purushartha but as karma\xe1\xb9\x85ga. In that case it produces no separate\nresult; while if considered as purushartha it has a special result of its own.\n\n[121:1](sbe38086.htm#fr_95) A clause added to guard against the assumption--\nwhich might be based on the preceding remarks--that conduct is, after all, the\ncause of the quality of the new birth.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 1, 11](sbe38087.htm)\n\n"
