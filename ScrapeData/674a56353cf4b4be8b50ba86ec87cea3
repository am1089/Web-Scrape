(Brahman is) not (the creator of the world), on account of (beings\nengaging in any action) having a motive.\n\nAnother objection is raised against the doctrine of an intelligent cause of\nthe world.--The intelligent highest Self cannot be the creator of the sphere\nof this world, 'on account of actions having a purpose.'--We know from\nordinary experience that man, who is an intelligent being, begins to act after\ndue consideration only, and does not engage even in an unimportant undertaking\nunless it serves some purpose of his own; much less so in important business.\nThere is also a scriptural passage confirming this result of common\nexperience, 'Verily everything is not dear that you may have everything; but\nthat you may love the Self therefore everything is dear' (B _ri_. Up. II, 4,\n5). Now the undertaking of creating the sphere of this world, with all its\nvarious contents, is certainly a weighty one. If, then, on the one hand, you\nassume it to serve some purpose of the intelligent highest Self, you thereby\nsublate its self-sufficiency vouched for by Scripture; if, on the other hand,\nyou affirm absence of motive on its part, you must affirm absence of activity\nalso.--Let us then assume that just as sometimes an intelligent person when in\na state of frenzy proceeds, owing to his mental aberration, to action without\na motive, so the highest Self also created this world without any motive.--\nThat, we reply, would contradict the omniscience of the highest Self, which is\nvouched for by Scripture.--Hence the doctrine of the creation proceeding from\nan intelligent Being is untenable.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1, 33](sbe34172.htm)\n\n"
