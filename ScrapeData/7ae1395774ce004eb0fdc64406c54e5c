'I am he who shakes the tree (i.e. the tree of the world, which has to be\ncut down by knowledge). 2. My glory is like the top of a mountain. 3. I, whose\npure light (of knowledge) has risen high, am that which is truly immortal, as\nit resides in the sun.\n\np. 52\n\n4\\. I am the brightest treasure. 5. I am wise, immortal, imperishable 1.' 6.\nThis is the teaching of the Veda, by the poet Tri _s_ a\xe1\xb9\x85ku.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[52:1](sbe15031.htm#fr_210) This verse has been translated as the commentator\nwishes it to be understood, in praise of that knowledge of Self which is only\nto be obtained after all other duties, and, more particularly, the study of\nthe Veda, have been performed. The text is probably corrupt, and the\ninterpretation fanciful.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 11](sbe15032.htm)\n\n"
