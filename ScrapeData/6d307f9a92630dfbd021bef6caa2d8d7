One would have\nsupposed that the chances of immediate death from cholera or typhoid were to\nchances of safety as fifty to one. I have not seen this alarm justified,\nhowever. I have been here now for some months without finding any reason for a\nday\'s illness.\n\nMy home is, in my eyes, charming. With its two courtyards, its limited second\nstory, and its quaintly-terraced roofs, built at five different levels, it is\na rambling specimen of the true old Hindu style of building. In the whole\nplace there is not an inch of glass; the lower casements are protected by\niron, and the upper by\n\np. 2\n\nwooden bars, and so, while the sunlight outside my little study is softened by\nmats made of dark green splints, my bedroom is always open to the stars. Here\nsome large family has lived in days gone by, and here maybe at least one\ngeneration has died off, and then, when the last of the older members was\ngone, those remaining would break up into smaller groups, again to become the\nnuclei of fresh communities. Crowded with memories the old house seems, of\nsuch lives as are passing continually beneath my windows, in the lane and the\nvillages without--ignorant and unsophisticated doubtless, but full of human\ntenderness and simple worship.\n\nThe lane is quite clean and so charmingly irregular. First on one side and\nthen on the other it gives a twist, and wherever there is a space between the\nlarger houses little villages have grown up. Here is one, a cluster of mud\nhuts, with their rich brown walls and their red-tiled roofs, nestling at the\nfoot of a cluster of cocoanut palms. High up against the blue these wave their\nplumes, and below their long shadows lie across a tiny tank and the roof of\nthe cowhouse and protect a few green things under the wall, To another village\nthe pump-like hydrant is the entrance, almost always surrounded by its veiled\nwomen, carrying their beautiful waterpots of brass or earthenware. Everywhere\nthe happy laughter\n\np. 3\n\nof children in the sunlight, everywhere the flutter of newly-washed drapery\nhung out to dry, every here and there a cow or two.\n\nHere, at my writing-table, surrounded by the books and pictures and the simple\nrefinements of modern life, I look out on a world of many centuries ago. Nay,\nit is with me here within my doors. I can never forget the day when my old\nwaiting-woman came to consult me about the purchase of a cooking-stove--to\ncost six farthings. Armed with this mighty sum she purchased three small iron\nbars, a large thin tile, and a little heap of Ganges mud, out of which she\nproceeded to construct a modest hearthplace of her own. On top of this she\nused, for cooking, a round earthen pot with a groove in the neck, and some\ndays later she very diffidently requested another six farthings to buy\nsomething like a pair of tongs with which to clasp this when hot. It was a\nslight and curious-looking utensil, and I suppose no man could say how long\nher ancestors have regarded its exact fellows as harmless luxuries of\nhousekeeping. The whole thing was eloquent of poverty, bravely met and\ndecently borne through many generations. Still more significant was it,\nhowever, to hear her crying gently when she found her earthen pot, not\nunnaturally, cracked over the fire. Its value was just one farthing! This old\nwoman is over seventy, and I, less than half her age,\n\np. 4\n\ncall her "Jhee" or "daughter." Even tiny children of higher rank call her,\nhowever, by this name, according to the beautiful custom of Hindu households,\nwhere to the women-servants the master and mistress are "father" and "mother,"\nand the daughters "jewel sisters." Nothing is commoner than for these old\nattendants to attach themselves to a family as grandmother, claiming the\nprivilege of scolding their employers and spoiling those employers\' children\nto the end of their days. In such cases the social inferiority of this member\nof the family group would not be easily perceived by a stranger. The mistress\nprepares her servant\'s food and gives it with her own hand (a curious\ninversion of our notions), and when the servant dies, in the fulness of time,\nshe is mourned by these kindred of her adoption as one of their own blood.\n\nThe number of services that Jhee could not perform made my early days\ninteresting. On my second afternoon, when I turned to her for hot water for my\ntea-tray, I was amused to see her suddenly disappear. It was only for a\nmoment, and she came back dripping, having found it necessary to take a bath\nbefore touching what I was about to eat. Exaggerations of this sort gradually\ndisappeared of their own accord, and now, strange to say, she condescends to\nwash my cups and saucers, though when another _mem-sahib_  \n\np. 5\n\nvisits me I find I must do this for my friend myself. These Indian\nsuperstitions about food, would surely repay elaborate study. But why has the\nnotion of purification always been overladen with so many inconveniences and\nrestrictions in Asiatic countries, while in old Greece it was apparently\npassed over with such lightness and grace?\n\nMy house has a courtyard. Why do we English carry the domestic architecture\nthat is appropriate to the British Isles into this Eastern land of sun and\nshine? Would it not be wise to take up the style of the country? The Hindu\ncertainly contrives to keep himself cooler than we do, and the great marble\ncourts that we see in rich men\'s houses, with plants grouped against their\nsteps and pillars, must be as beautiful as anything in Athens or Pompeii. Mine\nis no floor of pure white marble, yet it was long before I discovered the\nsecret of the pleasure that I took in opening my front door on my return in\nthe evening. Then I found that it was the meeting again with the sky and stars\nwithin. A great well of coolness and shadow in the daytime, and a temple of\neternity at night, a playground of merry breezes, and an open sundial--who\nwould not love a house with a courtyard?\n\nThe other architectural beauty of my home is its roof. Up there one pictures\noneself in Syria. Away in all directions stretch similar housetops,\n\np. 6\n\nbroken by the green of trees and gardens, and diversified by colonnades, and\nbalustrades, and steep stone staircases. The rich crowded beauty of Lahore is\nnot here on the great flats of Bengal. The impression is rather of breadth and\nsolitude, roofs and palm tufts, and the vast dome above. Here, at dawn or\nsunset or in the moonlight, one can feel alone with the whole universe. Down\nbelow, with the smoke rising from little fires of cooking as the evening meal\nis cooked within each court, how different from the cosy rural scene one would\nsee in England! But then how different, too, above! And this although in both\nit is that glimpse of fire that makes the glow of homecoming. For we must not\nforget the radiant purity of this upper air and the large luminousness of moon\nand stars.\n\nTo the Hindu woman, cooped up for the most part in her zenana, how much it\nmeans to possess such a roof. Here is her whole outlook on life--life in the\nabstract, life on the impersonal scale. Here is the neighbourhood of other\nwomen, for the roof of one zenana is often accessible to another; here are\ncoolness and merry talk in the long hours of summer nights, when all the girls\nof the family steal away to sleep where it is also possible to breathe; and\nhere also is that glimpse of the Ganges that is the lightener of toil and\nbringer of refreshment as of worship. Beautiful\n\np. 7\n\n[paragraph continues] Ganges! How she is loved of her children, and how\nquaintly delicate is that salutation to the river when, ere stepping into her\nand so soiling her with their feet, they stoop and place a little of the water\non their heads.\n\n"But hark, hark! the dogs do bark! The beggars are coming to town." A very\npractical question to the Indian house-mother is that of beggars. In a perfect\ntroop they come down the lane, though fortunately not every day: numbers of\nwell-dressed, good-humoured-looking men and women, clad in white for the most\npart, with large rosaries, tramping along, staff in one hand and begging-bowl\nin the other. Such complete social recognition do they receive that the city\nis actually mapped out in wards for their peregrinations, according to the day\nof the week. It is the solitary mendicant, however, who interests me most.\nTheoretically, in the great majority of cases, he is a barefooted friar, so to\nspeak, wearing the yellow robes that Buddha wore and appealing for alms in the\nstrength of the Sacred Name. Perhaps he was already within the doors when one\nheard it first, and there he stands repeating the sonorous _Haribol!_ or the\n_Sita Ram!_ which constitutes a prayer. This Indian feeling about the Name of\nGod is very striking. To repeat it is the whole of supplication, and they\nargue that, if putting the hand into a fire burns, whether we\n\np. 8\n\nfeel it or not, shall not the cry to the Almighty do good whether we know it\nor not? But maybe our friend remains still to sing a song, and this is worth\nmarking, for a whole literary form of great sweetness and power is devoted to\nthe service of these beggars; and not many years ago all that now remains of\nthe exquisite ballad-songs of Ram Prasad, the Robert Burns of Bengal, had to\nbe collected from just such sources as this. The author is always supposed to\ninclude his own name in the last couplet, and it will be seen at once how\nuseful this quaint canon would prove to the collector of the works of a\nparticular song-maker. Very little, a tiny pinch of rice or a few fruits or\nthe smallest of coin, will content our friend, but more could hardly be given\nwhen the claims are so many. There is no stigma in the mind of the giver,\nhowever, attaching to the man who had to say, "Mother, give me food." The\ndictum that the "starving man has a natural right to his neighbour\'s bread"\nwould rouse no responsive thrill in India, where something very like it is\ntaken as a fundamental social axiom.\n\nFull of unlooked-for interests is the life here--amongst "new men, strange\nfaces, other minds." A few inches off my table as I write are the constant\nflutter of wings and the sounds of the voices of birds; yet a little further\nthe waving of trees--the _neem_ , and the bo-tree, and the palms\n\np. 9\n\nand underneath and all about a life throbbing with newness yet aglow with the\nsecrets of the past. I look at my Whitman and Wordsworth and the exquisite\nbeauty of the "Beata Beatrix," and I long to be able to pass from the one\npsychic atmosphere to the other at will, a transition without which the mere\naccident of physical presence is worth little. Yet as I utter the wish it is\nalready to some small extent answered, and I have perceived a larger existence\nthan I had conceived before--a certain immense life of Humanity, in which time\nand distance are alike merged, and where the Eastern and the Western Aryan\nhave become one in their noblest manifestations, as Walt Whitman saw it;--\n\n"Sail, sail thy best ship, O Democracy,  \nOf value is thy freight, \'tis not the Present only,  \nThe Past is also stored in thee;  \nThou boldest not the venture of thyself alone, not of the Western Continent\nalone,  \nEarth\'s resume entire floats on thy keel, O ship, is steadied by thy spars,  \nWith thee time voyages in trust, the antecedent nations sink or swim with\nthee,  \nWith all their ancient struggles, martyrs, heroes, epics, wars, thou bear\'st\nthe other continents,  \nTheirs, theirs as much as thine, the destination port triumphant.  \nSteer then with good strong hand and wary eye, O helmsman! Thou carriest great\ncompanions,  \nVenerable, priestly Asia sails this day with thee,  \nAnd royal Feudal Europe sails with thee."\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Our Zenana Terrace](seh07.htm)\n\n'
