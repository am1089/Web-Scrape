Charm for finding lost property.\n\n1\\. On the distant path of the paths Pushan was born, on the distant path of\nheaven, on the distant path of the earth. Upon the two most lovely places both\nhe walks hither and away, knowing (the way).  \n2\\. Pushan knows these regions all; he shall lead us by the most dangerless\n(way). Bestowing well-being, of radiant glow, keeping our heroes undiminished,\nhe shall, alert and skilful, go before us!  \n3\\. O Pushan, under thy law may we never suffer harm: as praisers of thee are\nwe here!  \n4\\. Pushan shall from the east place his right hand about us, shall bring\nagain to us what has been lost: we shall come upon what has been lost!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 128.
