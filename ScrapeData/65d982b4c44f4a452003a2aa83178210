Should any one of the six persons (mentioned in the _S_ rauta-sutra and\nin the Sutras 4-9) to whom the Arghya reception is due, visit (him), let him\nmake (ready) a cow, a goat, or what (sort of food) he thinks most like\n(thereto).\n\n2 2-3. Let the Argha not be without flesh.\n\n3\\. On the occasion of a sacrifice and of a wedding let (the guest) say, 'Make\nit (ready).'\n\np. 88\n\n4\\. The animal (offered) to the teacher is sacred to Agni;\n\n5\\. If offered to an officiating priest, to B _ri_ haspati;\n\n6 6. If to the father-in-law, to Pra _g_ apati;\n\n7\\. If to a king, to Indra;\n\n8 8. If to a friend, to Mitra;\n\n9\\. If to a Snataka, to Indra and Agni;\n\n10\\. Even if he performs more than one Soma sacrifice during a year, let only\npriests who have received (from him) the Arghya reception officiate for him,\nnot such who have not received it.\n\n11 11. Here it is said also:\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[87:1](sbe29045.htm#fr_194) 15, 1. This Sutra presupposes the _S_ rauta-sutra\nIV, 21, 1: 'To six persons the Argha reception is due, viz. to the teacher, to\nan officiating priest, to the father-in-law, to a king, to a Snataka, to a\nfriend.' Here the fourth person mentioned is the _s_ va _s_ ura, while in the\nG _ri_ hya text the expression vaivahya is used. It is difficult not to\nbelieve that both words are used in the same sense, and accordingly Naraya _n_\na says vivahya _h_ _s_ va _s_ ura _h_. Comp. Professor Stenzler's note on\nParaskara I, 3, 1; \xc3\x82pastamba II, 8, 7; Gautama V, 27.\n\nSamanyatama _m_ sad _ri_ _s_ atama _m_ mashadikam (makhadikam the MS.) annam.\nNaraya _n_ a.\n\n[87:2-3](sbe29045.htm#fr_195) 2, 3. These Sutras are identical with Paraskara\nI, 3, 29. 30. The following Sutra of Paraskara stands in the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana\ntext as p. 88 Sutra 10. Probably Paraskara here represents the text which both\nSutrakaras follow, more exactly, and the enumeration given by _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana in\nSutras 4-9 of the different categories of Arghyas with the corresponding\ndeities, is an addition to that original stock of rules.\n\nApparently the two Sutras 2 and 3 stand in contradiction to each other, as\nSutra 2 seems to prescribe that at the Argha meal in every case flesh should\nbe given to the guest, and Sutra 3 specifies only two occasions on which the\nkilling of the Argha cow cannot be dispensed with. Perhaps the meaning is\nthis, that it is not necessary, except in the cases of a sacrifice and of a\nwedding, to kill a cow expressly for that purpose, but that in any case, even\nif the cow offered to the guest be declined by him, the host should take care\nthat some flesh be served at that meal. So says Naraya _n_ a in his note on \xc3\x82\n_s_ valayana-G _ri_ hya I, 24, 33, 'Pa _s_ ukara _n_ apakshe tanma _m_ sena\nbho _g_ anam, utsar _g_ anapakshe ma _m_ santare _n_ a.' Similarly the\nBuddhists distinguish between eating flesh and eating the flesh of an animal\nexpressly killed in order to entertain that very guest.\n\n[88:6](sbe29045.htm#fr_196) The literal translation of vaivahya would be 'a\nperson related by marriage.' But comp. the note on Sutra 1.\n\n[88:8](sbe29045.htm#fr_197) Priya of course does not mean _g_ amatar, as is\nstated in a number of commentaries. Gobhila says, priyo\xe0\xa4\xbdtithi _h_.\n\n[88:11](sbe29045.htm#fr_198) Other persons, for instance a king, can claim the\nArgha reception not more than once a year. Comp. \xc3\x82pastamba II, 8, 7; Gautama\nV, 28, 29, &c.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 16](sbe29046.htm)\n\n"
