Tarukshya 2 said: 'The Sa _m_ hita (union) is formed by means of the B\n_ri_ hat and Rathantara 3 Samans.'\n\n2\\. Verily, the Rathantara Saman is speech, the B _ri_ hat Saman is breath. By\nboth, by speech and breath, the Sa _m_ hita is formed 4.\n\n3\\. For this Upanishad (for acquiring from his teacher the knowledge of this\nSa _m_ hita of speech and breath) Tarukshya guards (his teacher's) cows a\nwhole year.\n\n4\\. For it alone Tarukshya guards the cows a whole year.\n\np. 255\n\n5\\. This has also been declared by a _Ri_ shi (Rv. X, 181, 1; and Rv. X, 181,\n2):--\n\n6\\. 'Vasish _th_ a carried hither the Rathantara; 'Bharadvaga brought hither\nthe B _ri_ hat of Agni.'\n\n7\\. He who thus knows this Sa _m_ hita (union), becomes united with offspring,\ncattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga. He lives his full\nage.\n\n8\\. Kau _n_ _th_ aravya said: 'Speech is united with breath, breath with the\nblowing air, the blowing air with the Vi _s_ vedevas, the Vi _s_ vedevas with\nthe heavenly world, the heavenly world with Brahman. That Sa _m_ hita is\ncalled the gradual Sa _m_ hita.'\n\n9\\. He who knows this gradual Sa _m_ hita (union), becomes united with\noffspring, cattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga, in\nexactly the same manner as this Sa _m_ hita, i.e. gradually.\n\n10\\. If that worshipper, whether for his own sake or for that of another,\nrecites (the Sa _m_ hita), let him know when he is going to recite, that this\nSa _m_ hita went up to heaven, and that it will be even so with those who by\nknowing it become Devas. May it always be so!\n\n11\\. He who thus knows this Sa _m_ hita (union), becomes united with\noffspring, cattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga. He\nlives his full age.\n\n12\\. Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ ala _k_ a _n_ _d_ a said: 'The Sa _m_ hita (union, composition)\nis speech.'\n\n13\\. Verily, by speech the Vedas, by speech the metres are composed. Friends\nunite through speech, all beings unite through speech; therefore speech is\neverything here 1.\n\np. 256\n\n14\\. With regard to this (view of speech being more than breath), it should be\nborne in mind that when we thus repeat (the Veda) or speak, breath is\n(absorbed) in speech; speech swallows breath. And when we are silent or sleep,\nspeech is (absorbed) in breath; breath swallows speech. The two swallow each\nother. Verily, speech is the mother, breath the son.\n\n15\\. This has been declared also by a _Ri_ shi (Rv. X, 114, 4):--\n\n16\\. 'There is one bird; (as wind) he has entered the sky; (as breath or\nliving soul) he saw this whole world. With my ripe mind I saw him close to me\n(in the heart); the mother (licks or) absorbs him (breath), and he absorbs the\nmother (speech).'\n\n17\\. He who thus knows this Sa _m_ hita (union), becomes united with\noffspring, cattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga. He\nlives his full age.\n\n18\\. Next follows the Pra _g_ apati-Sa _m_ hita.\n\n19\\. The former half is the wife, the latter half the man; the result of their\nunion the son; the act of their union the begetting; that Sa _m_ hita is Aditi\n(indestructible).\n\n20\\. For Aditi (indestructible) is all this whatever there is, father, mother,\nson, and begetting.\n\n21\\. This has also been declared by a _Ri_ shi (Rv. I, 189, 10)--\n\n22\\. 'Aditi is mother, is father, is son.'\n\n23\\. He who thus knows this Sa _m_ hita (union), becomes united with\noffspring, cattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga. He\nlives his full age.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[254:2](sbe01232.htm#fr_650) The Kashmir MS. reads Tarkshya, a name used\nbefore as the title of a hymn (Ait. \xc3\x82r. I, 5, 2, 8). Here Tarakshya seems\npreferable, see Pa _n_. IV, 1, 105.\n\n[254:3](sbe01232.htm#fr_651) See Ait. \xc3\x82r. I, 4, 2, 1-4.\n\n[254:4](sbe01232.htm#fr_652) These two, the B _ri_ hat and Rathantara, are\nrequired for the P _ri_ sh _th_ astotra in the Agnish _t_ oma, and they are to\nremind the worshipper that speech and breath are required for all actions.\n\n[255:1](sbe01232.htm#fr_653) Everything can be obtained by speech in this life\nand in the next.
