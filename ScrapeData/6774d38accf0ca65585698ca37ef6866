Narada said :-- O Sinless one! The greatness of the Rudrak _s_ a seed\nthat you have described is verily such. Now I ask why is this Rudrak _s_ am so\nmuch entitled to worship by the people. Please speak clearly on this point.\nNaraya _n_ a spoke :-- O Child! This is the very question that was asked once\nby Kartika, the sixfaced One, to Bhagavan Rudra, dwelling in Kailas'a. What He\nreplied, I say now. Listen. Rudra Deva spoke :-- O Child _S_ a _d_ anana. I\nwill dwell briefly on the secret cause of the greatness of the Rudrak _s_ a\nseed. Hear. In days of yore, there was a Daitya called Tripura who could not\nbe conquered by any body. Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and the other Devas were defeated\nby him. They then came to Me and requested Me to kill the Asura. At their\nrequest, I called in my mind the Divine Great weapon, named Aghora, beautiful\nand terrible and containing the strength of all the Devas, to kill him. It was\ninconceivable and it was blazing with fire.\n\n\n\np. 1065\n\n\n\nFor full divine one thousand years I remained awake with eyelids wide open in\nthinking of the Aghora weapon, the destroyer of all obstacles, whereby the\nkilling of Tripurasura might be effected and the troubles of the Devas be\nremoved. Not for a moment my eyelids dropped. There by my eyes were affected\nand drops of water came out of my eyes. Note here. How enemies are to be\nkilled. It requires great thought, great concentration, great yoga and great\npowers. O Mahasena! From those drops of water coming out of my eyes, the great\ntree of Rudrak _s_ am did spring for the welfare of all. This Rudrak _s_ a\nseed is of thirty-eight varieties. From My Surya Netra, i.e., My right eye,\nsymbolizing the Sun, twelve yellow coloured (Pingala colour) varieties have\ncome; and from my left eye representing the Moon, the Soma Netra, sixteen\nvarieties of white colour and from my third eye on the top, representing Fire,\ni.e., the Agni Netra, ten varieties of black colour have come out. Of these\nthe white Rudrak _s_ ams are Brahmi _n_ s and they are used by the Brahma _n_\nas; the red coloured ones are the K _s_ attriyas and should be used by the K\n_s_ attriyas and the black ones are S\xc2\x92udras and should be used by the Vai _s_\nyas and the S\xc2\x92udras.\n\n\n\n12-19. One faced Rudrak _s_ a seed is the S\xc2\x92iva Himself, made manifest and\nrendered vivid; even the sin incurred in killing a Brahma _n_ a is destroyed\nthereby. Two faced or two headed Rudrak _s_ am is like the Deva and the Devi.\nTwo sorts of sins are destroyed thereby. The three faced Rudrak _s_ am is like\nfire; the sin incurred in killing a woman is destroyed in a moment. The four\nfaced Rudrak _s_ a seed is like Brahma and removes the sin of killing persons.\nThe five faced Rudrak _s_ am is verily an image of Rudra; all sorts of sins,\ne.g., eating prohibited food, going to the ungoables, etc., are destroyed\nthereby. The six faced Rudrak _s_ am is Kartikeya. It is to be worn on the\nright hand. One becomes freed of the Brahmahatya sin. There is no manner of\ndoubt in this. The seven faced Rudrak _s_ am is named Ananga. Holding this\nfrees one from the sin of stealing gold, etc., O Mahasena! The eight faced\nRudrak _s_ a is Vinayaka. Holding this frees one from the sin of holding an\nillicit contact with a woman of a bad family and with the wife of one's Guru,\netc., and other sins as well. It enables one to acquire heaps of food, cotton,\nand gold; and in the end the Highest Place is attained.\n\n\n\n20-35. The fruit of holding the eight faced Rudrak _s_ a seed has been said.\nNow I will talk of the nine-faced Rudrak _s_ am. It is verily the Bhairava\nmade manifest. On the left hand it should be worn. By this, the people get\nboth Bhoga (enjoyment) and Mok _s_ a (liberation)\n\n\n\np. 1066\n\n\n\nand they become powerful like Me and get themselves freed at once, without the\nleast delay, of the sins incurred by committing thousands of abortions,\nhundreds of Brahmahattyas (killing the Brahma _n_ as). Holding the ten-faced\nRudrak _s_ a is verily wearing Janardana, the Deva of the Devas. The holding\nof which pacifies the evils caused by planets, Pis'achas, Vetalas, Brahma Rak\n_s_ asas, and Pannagas. The eleven-faced Rudrak _s_ am is like the Eleven\nRudras. The fruits, the efficacy of which I now describe. Hear. The fruits\nobtained through the performance of one thousand horse sacrifices, one hundred\nVajapeya sacrifices, and making gifts of one hundred thousand cows are\nobtained thereby.\n\n\n\nIf one wears the twelve-headed Rudrak _s_ am on one's ear, the \xc3\x82dityas get\nsatisfied. The fruits of performing Gomedha and As'vamedha sacrifices are\nobtained thereby. No fear comes from burned buffaloes, armed enemies and\nwolves and tigers and other murderous animals. Also the several diseases of\nthe body never come to him. The holder of the twelve-faced Rudrak _s_ a seed\nfeels always happy and he is the master of some kingdoms He becomes freed of\nthe sins incurred in killing elephants, horses, deer, cats, snakes, mice,\nfrogs, asses, foxes and various other animals.\n\n\n\nO Child! The thirteen faced Rudrak _s_ am is very rare; if anybody gets it, he\nbecomes like Karti Keya and gets all desires fulfilled; and the eight siddhis\nare under his grasp. He learns how to make gold, silver and other metals; he\nattains all sorts of enjoyments. There is no manner of doubt in this. O Sa _d_\nanana! If anybody holds the thirteen faced Rudrak _s_ am, he becomes freed\nfrom the sins incurred in killing mother, father and brothers.\n\n\n\nO Son! If one holds on one's head the fourteen faced Rudrak _s_ am always, one\nbecomes like S\xc2\x92iva. O Muni! What more shall I speak to you! The Devas pay\ntheir respects to one holding the fourteen faced Rudrak _s_ as and he in the\nend attains the Highest Goal, the state of S\xc2\x92iva. His body becomes verily the\nbody of S\xc2\x92iva.\n\n\n\n36-40. The Devas always worship the Rudrak _s_ a seed; the highest goal is\nattained by wearing the Rudrak _s_ am. The Brahma _n_ as should hold on their\nheads at least one Rudrak _s_ am with devotion. A rosary of twenty-six Rudrak\n_s_ ams is to be made and tied on the head. Similarly a rosary of fifty seeds\nis to be worn and suspended on the breast; sixteen each on each of the two\narms; twenty-four Rudrak _s_ ams to be worn on the wrists, twelve on each. O\nSa _d_ anana! If a rosary be made of one hundred and eight, fifty or twenty-\nseven Rudrak _s_ ams and if japam be done with that, immeasurable merits are\nobtained. If anybody wears a rosary of one hundred and eight seeds, he gets at\nevery moment\n\n\n\np. 1067\n\n\n\nthe fruit of performing the As'vamedha sacrifices and uplifts his twenty-one\ngenerations and finally he resides in the S\xc2\x92iva Loka.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fourth Chapter of the Eleventh Book on the Greatness of the\nRudrak _s_ am in the Mahapura _n_ am S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses\nby Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 5](bk11ch05.htm)\n\n"
