The text says: "Here is\nLakshman the charioteer of words who by the orders of Rama has come hither\nupon the ear of resolution." In his Italian translation he renders the\npassage: "Here is Laksh- man, the brother of Rama who by his orders comes\nhither the determined bearer of words."\n\n[364:1](ry306.htm#fr_637) Indra\'s associates in arms, and musicians of his\nheaven.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXXIII.: Lakshman\'s Entry.](ry307.htm)\n\n'
