Now at the time when he there 2 proceeds with the guest-meal, he\nwho intends to perform the Pravargya, prior to the Upasads 3, spreads Ku _s_ a\ngrass with its tops directed towards the east, in front of the Garhapatya, and\nplaces the vessels thereon in pairs 4,--the Upayamani (tray) and the Mahavira\n(pot), the pair of lifting-sticks 5, the\n\np. 459\n\ntwo milking-bowls, the two Rauhi _n_ a-plates, the two offering spoons for the\nRauhi _n_ a (cakes), and whatever other (implement) there is,--these make ten,\nfor the Vira _g_ consists of ten syllables, and the sacrifice is Vira _g_ : he\nthus makes this to be equal to the Vira _g_ , the sacrifice. And as to their\nbeing in pairs,--a pair means strength, for when two take hold of each other\nthey exert strength; and a pair (couple) means a productive union: with a\nproductive union he thus supplies and completes it.\n\n14:1:3:22\\. Then the Adhvaryu takes the (lustral) sprinkling water, and,\nstepping up, says, 'Brahman, we shall proceed: Hot _ri_ , sing praises!' for\nthe Brahman is seated on the right (south) side as the guardian of the\nsacrifice: to him he thus says, 'Sit thou undistracted: we are about to\nrestore the head of the Sacrifice;' and 'Hot _ri_ , sing praises!' he says,\nbecause the Hot _ri_ is the sacrifice: he thus thereby says to him, 'Restore\nthe head of the sacrifice!' and accordingly the Hot _ri_ begins to recite--\n\n14:1:3:33\\. [Va _g_. S. XIII, 3,] 'The Brahman, firstborn from afore 1,--the\nBrahman, doubtless, is yonder\n\np. 460\n\nsun, and he is born day by day from afore (in the east); and the Pravargya\nalso is that (sun): it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'The\nBrahman (n.), firstborn from afore.' He then sprinkles (the vessels): the\nimport of this is the same as before 1.\n\n14:1:3:44\\. He sprinkles (the chief Mahavira) with (Va _g_. S. XXXVII, 11),\n'For Yama thee!'--Yama, doubtless, is he who shines yonder, for it is he who\ncontrols (yam) everything here, and by him everything here is controlled; and\nthe Pravargya also is that (sun): it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore\nhe says, 'For Yama (I sprinkle) thee.'\n\n14:1:3:55\\. 'For Makha thee!'--Makha, doubtless, is he who shines yonder, and\nthe Pravargya also is that one: it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he\nsays, 'For Makha thee.'\n\n14:1:3:66\\. 'For Surya's heat thee!'--Surya, doubtless, is he who shines\nyonder, and the Pravargya also is that one: it is him he thus gratifies, and\ntherefore he says, 'For Surya's heat thee.'\n\n14:1:3:77\\. Having taken out a post 2 by the front door (of the _s_ ala), he\ndrives it into the ground on the south side (of the _s_ ala 3), so that the\nHot _ri_ , whilst singing praises, may look upon it; for the Hot _ri_ is the\nsacrifice, and he thereby restores the sacrifice to this (earth), and she\ncauses the Gharma (milk) to rise.\n\np. 461\n\n14:1:3:88\\. Having turned round the Emperor's throne-seat 1 in front of the\n\xc3\x82havaniya, he places it south thereof, and north of the King's (Soma's)\nthrone-seat 2, so as to face the east.\n\n14:1:3:99\\. It is made of Udumbara wood, for the Udumbara means strength: with\nstrength, with vital sap, he thus supplies and completes it (the Pravargya).\n\n14:1:3:1010\\. It is shoulder-high, for on the shoulders this head is set: he\nthus sets the head upon the shoulders.\n\n14:1:3:1111\\. It is wound all over with cords 3 of Balva _g_ a grass (Eleusine\nindica). When the sacrifice had its head cut off, its vital sap flowed out,\nand thence these plants grew up: with that life-sap he thus supplies and\ncompletes it.\n\n14:1:3:1212 And as to why he places it north (of Soma's seat),--Soma is the\nsacrifice, and the Pravargya is its head; but the head is higher (uttara):\ntherefore he places it north (uttara) of it. Moreover, Soma is king, and the\nPravargya is emperor, and the imperial dignity is higher than the royal:\ntherefore he places it north of it 4.\n\np. 462\n\n14:1:3:1313\\. And when the Hot _ri_ recites this (verse, Rig-v. V, 43, 7),\n'Whom the priests anoint, as if spreading him . . .,' he anoints that Mahavira\nwhich is to be used, all over with ghee 1, with, 'May the god Savit _ri_\nanoint thee with honey!' for Savit _ri_ is the impeller of the gods, and honey\nmeans everything whatever there is here: he thus anoints it (or him) all over\nwith everything here, and Savit _ri_ , as the impeller, impels it for him,--\nthis is why he says, 'May the god Savit _ri_ anoint thee with honey!'\n\n14:1:3:1414\\. Now sand has been strewed 2 on the north side of it: below that\nhe (previously) throws (a plate of) white gold 3, with, 'Protect it from\ncontact with the earth!' For at that time the gods were afraid lest the\nRakshas, the fiends, might injure that (Pravargya) of theirs from below; and\nthat, to wit, gold, being Agni's seed, it (serves) for repelling the fiends,\nthe Rakshas. But, indeed, the Earth also was afraid of this lest this\n(Pravargya), when heated and glowing 4, might injure\n\np. 463\n\nher: he thus keeps it separate from her. White it is, for white, as it were 1,\nis this earth.\n\n14:1:3:1515\\. And when the Hot _ri_ recites this (verse, Rig-v. I, 36, 9),\n'Sit thee down: thou art great . . .,' sheaths of reed-grass are kindled on\nboth sides 2, and throwing them (on the mound), he puts (the Mahavira pot)\nthereon. When the sacrifice had its head cut off, its life-sap flowed away,\nand therefrom these plants grew up: with that life-sap he thus supplies and\ncompletes it.\n\n14:1:3:1616\\. And as to why they are kindled on both sides: he thereby repels\nthe Rakshas, the fiends, from all the quarters. Whilst this (pot) is being\nheated, the (Sacrificer's) wife covers her head, thinking, 'Lest this one,\nwhen heated and glowing, should rob me of my eyesight,' for it indeed becomes\nheated and glowing.\n\n14:1:3:1717\\. He puts it on with, 'Flame thou art, glow thou art, heat thou\nart;'--for the Gharma is he who shines yonder, and he indeed is all that: it\nis him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'Flame thou art, glow thou\nart, heat thou art.'\n\n14:1:3:1818\\. He (the Sacrificer) then invokes blessings on this (earth) 3,\nfor the sacrifice is this (earth): it is thus (whilst being) on her that he\ninvokes blessings, and she fulfils them all for him.\n\np. 464\n\n14:1:3:1919\\. [Va _g_. S. XXXVII, 12,] 'Unmolested thou art in front (in the\neast),'--for unmolested by the Rakshas, the fiends, indeed, this (earth) is in\nfront;--'in Agni's over-lordship,'--he thus makes Agni her over-lord for the\nwarding off of the fiends, the Rakshas;--'grant thou life unto me!'--he thus\nsecures life for himself, and accordingly he attains the full (term of) life.\n\n14:1:3:2020\\. 'Possessed of sons towards the south,'--in this there is nothing\nhidden, so to speak;--'in Indra's over-lordship,'--he thus makes Indra her\nover-lord for the warding off of the fiends, the Rakshas;--'grant thou\noffspring unto me!'--he thus secures offspring and cattle for himself, and\naccordingly he becomes possessed of sons and of cattle.\n\n14:1:3:2121\\. 'Well to live on behind (towards the western region),'--in this\nthere is nothing hidden, so to speak;--'in god Savit _ri_ 's over-lordship;'--\nthe god Savit _ri_ he thus makes her over-lord for the warding off of the\nfiends, the Rakshas;--'grant thou eyesight unto me!'--he thus secures eyesight\nfor himself, and accordingly he becomes possessed of eyesight.\n\n14:1:3:2222\\. 'A sphere of hearing towards the north,'--'causing (sacrificial\ncalls) to be heard 1,' is what he thereby means to say;--'in the creator's\nover-lordship,'--the creator he thus\n\np. 465\n\nmakes her over-lord for the warding off of the fiends, the Rakshas; 'grant\nthou prosperity (increase) of wealth unto me!'--wealth, prosperity, he thus\nsecures for himself, and accordingly he becomes wealthy and prosperous.\n\n14:1:3:2323\\. 'Disposition above,'--'disposing 1 above' is what he thereby\nmeans to say;--'in B _ri_ haspati's over-lordship,'--B _ri_ haspati he thus\nmakes her over-lord for the warding off of the fiends, the Rakshas;--'grant me\nvigour!'--vigour he thereby secures to himself, and accordingly he becomes\nvigorous, strong.\n\n14:1:3:2424\\. On the right (south) side (of the Mahavira) he (the Sacrificer)\nthen makes amends by (laying down) the hand with the palm upwards, with,\n'Shield me from all evil spirits!' whereby he means to say, 'Protect me from\nall troubles!' When the sacrifice had its head cut off, its life-sap flowed\naway, and went to the Fathers, but the Fathers are three in number 2: it is\nwith these that he thus supplies and completes it (the Pravargya).\n\n14:1:3:2525\\. Thereupon, whilst touching her (the earth) 3,\n\np. 466\n\n[paragraph continues] 'Thou art Manu's mare,' for, having become a mare, she\n(the earth) indeed carried Manu, and he is her lord, Pra _g_ apati: with that\nmate, his heart's delight, he thus supplies and completes him (Pra _g_ apati,\nthe Pravargya, and Sacrificer).\n\n14:1:3:2626\\. He then lays pieces of (split) Vika\xe1\xb9\x85kata wood round (the\nMahavira), two pointing to the east 1, with (Va _g_. S. XXXVII, 13), 'Hail! be\nthou encompassed by the Maruts!'--the call of 'hail!' he places first, and the\ndeity last 2; for the call of 'hail!' is he who shines yonder, and the\nPravargya also is that (sun): it is him he thus gratifies; and hence he places\nthe call of 'hail!' first, and the deity last.\n\n14:1:3:2727\\. 'Be thou encompassed by the Maruts,' he says; for the Maruts are\nthe (common) people: he thus surrounds the nobility by the people, whence the\nnobility here is surrounded on both sides by the people. Silently (he lays\ndown) two pointing to the north 3, silently (again) two pointing to the east,\nsilently two pointing to the north, silently two pointing to the east.\n\n14:1:3:2828\\. He makes them to amount to thirteen, for there are thirteen\nmonths in the year, and the\n\np. 467\n\nyear is he who shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that (sun): it is him\nhe thus gratifies, and hence he makes them to amount to thirteen.\n\n14:1:3:2929\\. He then places a gold plate (weighing a hundred grains) on the\ntop (of the pot), with, 'Protect it from contact with the sky!' For at that\ntime the gods were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, might injure that\n(Pravargya) of theirs from above; and that--to wit, gold--being Agni's seed,\nit (serves) for repelling the fiends, the Rakshas. But, indeed, the Sky also\nwas afraid of this lest this (Pravargya), when heated and glowing, might\ninjure it: he thus keeps it separate therefrom. It is yellow, for yellow, as\nit were, is the sky.\n\n14:1:3:3030\\. He (the Adhvaryu) then fans (the fire) thrice by means of\n(three) fans 1, whilst muttering, 'Honey!' each time; for honey means breath:\nhe thus lays breath into it. Three (fans) there are, for there are three\nbreathings, the out (and in)-breathing, the up-breathing and the through-\nbreathing: it is these he thus lays into it.\n\n14:1:3:3131\\. They then fan it thrice 2 in the non-sunwise way. When the\nsacrifice had its head cut off, its life-sap flowed away, and went to the\nFathers,--the Fathers being three in number 3: with them he thus supplies it.\n\n14:1:3:3232\\. But, indeed, the breathings depart from those who perform the\nfanning at the sacrifice. They\n\np. 468\n\nfan again thrice in the sunwise way,--this makes six; and six in number are\nthese breathings (vital airs) in the head: it is these he thus lays into it.\nThey cook the two Rauhi _n_ a (cakes). When a blaze is produced, he takes off\nthe gold (plate).\n\n14:1:3:3333\\. And when the Hot _ri_ recites this (verse, Rig-v. I, 112, 24),\n'Successful, O A _s_ vins, make ye our voice,' the Adhvaryu steps up, and\nsays, 'The Gharma is aglow 1.' If it be aglow, he may know that the Sacrificer\nwill become more prosperous; and if it be not aglow, he may know that he will\nbecome poorer; and if it be neither aglow nor the reverse, he may know that he\n(the Sacrificer) will become neither more prosperous nor poorer: but indeed\n(the pot) should be fanned so (long) as to be aglow.\n\n14:1:3:3434\\. And, verily, whosoever either teaches, or partakes of, this\n(Pravargya) enters that life, and that light: the observance thereof is the\nsame as at the creation 2.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[458:2](sbe44119.htm#fr_1220) That is, at the Soma-sacrifice, of the\npreliminary day (upavasatha) of which the guest-meal to, or hospitable\nreception (atithya) of, King Soma forms part (see part ii, p. 85 seqq.). The\nassumption here is, that the performance of the Pravargya takes place on that\nday before the Pressing-day, whilst in reality it has been performed for at\nleast two days before that.\n\n[458:3](sbe44119.htm#fr_1221) See III, 4, 4, 1. The Upasads are performed\ntwice daily, for at least three days, up to the day before the Soma-sacrifice;\nand if the Pravargya is to be performed likewise, it precedes immediately each\nperformance of the Upasad. Cf. also [XIV, 3, 1, 1](sbe44123.htm#14:3:1:1) with\nnote.\n\n[458:4](sbe44119.htm#fr_1222) Prior to this, the doors of the _s_ ala are to\nbe closed, to keep the Mahavira from being seen; see [p.\n452](sbe44118.htm#page_452), note [2](sbe44118.htm#fn_1194). The entire\nperformance of the Pravargya indeed has to be kept secret from the eyes of\nunauthorised persons.\n\n[458:5](sbe44119.htm#fr_1223) The 'pari _s_ asau' (also called ' _s_ aphau,'\n[XIV, 2, 1, 16](sbe44121.htm#14:2:1:16)) are two p. 459 pieces of wood or\nlaths apparently fastened together by a kind of clasp (or a cord) at one end,\nso as to serve the purpose of a pair of tongs (pari _s_ asau sa _m_ da _m_ _s_\nakarau, comm. on Katy. XXVI, 2, to) for taking up the Mahavira pot, which must\nnot be handled in any other way. According to Haug, Ait. Br., Transl., p. 51,\nthey are placed underneath the pot in lifting it, but this seems very\nimprobable, seeing that, at the end of the sacrifice, the Adhvaryu, by means\nof them, turns the pot upside down so as to pour the remainder of its contents\ninto the offering spoon (see Katy. XXIV, 6, 17 with comm.); nor could the\nblackened pot in that way be cleansed properly and placed on the supporting\ntray ([XIV, 2, 1, 16](sbe44121.htm#14:2:1:16)-[17](sbe44121.htm#14:2:1:17)).\n\n[459:1](sbe44119.htm#fr_1224) For the complete verse, see VII, 4, 1, 14. For\nthe complete p. 460 series of texts recited by the Hot _ri_ , see Ait. Br. I,\n19 seqq.; \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_ r. IV, 6.\n\n[460:1](sbe44119.htm#fr_1225) Viz. he makes the vessels sacrificially pure (I,\n3, 3, 1).\n\n[460:2](sbe44119.htm#fr_1226) For tying the cow that is to furnish the milk\nfor the Gharma. Near it a peg is driven into the ground to tie the goat to\nwhose milk is to be used afterwards.\n\n[460:3](sbe44119.htm#fr_1227) That would be, south of the southern door\n(\xc3\x82past. XV, 6,-23).\n\n[461:1](sbe44119.htm#fr_1228) The Pravargya is styled 'samra _g_ ,' or\nuniversal king, emperor; as distinguished from King Soma, for whose seat,\nreaching only up to the navel, see III, 3, 4, 26 seqq. (Cf. also that of the\nUkhya Agni, which is only a span high, VI, 7, I, 1, 22 seqq.)--For a similar\nattribution of imperial dignity (samra _g_ ya)--as well as royal dignity (ra\n_g_ ya)--to him who is consecrated by the Sautrama _n_ i (where the seat used\nis knee-high), see [XII, 8, 3, 4](sbe44070.htm#12:8:3:4) seqq.\n\n[461:2](sbe44119.htm#fr_1229) \xc3\x82past. XV, 6, 10 places it in front (east) of\nthe seat for Soma.\n\n[461:3](sbe44119.htm#fr_1230) Cf. [XII, 8, 3, 6](sbe44070.htm#12:8:3:6).\n\n[461:4](sbe44119.htm#fr_1231) According to Katy. XXVI, 2, 27 (\xc3\x82past. XV, 6,\nII), the black antelope-skin is then spread over the seat, and the two unused\nMahavira pots (as well as the reserve piece of clay and the spade, Katy.)\nplaced thereon.\n\n[462:1](sbe44119.htm#fr_1232) Katy. XXVI, 2, 4 refers to the pot as\n'containing ghee (a _g_ yavant),' which the comm. takes to mean 'filled with\nconsecrated ghee;' whilst \xc3\x82past. XV, 7, 5 leaves the option between greasing\nit (a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ) and filling it (abhipur) with ghee. It would doubtless, at all\nevents, be abundantly greased inside.\n\n[462:2](sbe44119.htm#fr_1233) North of the Garhapatya and the \xc3\x82havaniya in the\n_s_ ala two mounds (khara) are formed, covered with (or consisting of) sand.\nThe one north of the latter fire is here alluded to.\n\n[462:3](sbe44119.htm#fr_1234) That is, a silver plate weighing a hundred\ngrains.\n\n[462:4](sbe44119.htm#fr_1235) Though 'tapta _h_ ' and ' _s_ u _s_ u _k_ ana\n_h_ ' are here translated as if they were actually co-ordinate predicates, I\nam not sure whether we should not rather take the passage to mean,--that this\nglowing one, when heated; or rather, this one when heated so as to be glowing.\nCf. [XIV, 2, 1, 18](sbe44121.htm#14:2:1:18); [3, 1,\n14](sbe44123.htm#14:3:1:14), where I prefer to subordinate one of the\nparticiples to the other.\n\n[463:1](sbe44119.htm#fr_1236) I read, 'ra _g_ ateva'; cf. the corresponding\n'hari _n_ iva hi dyau _h_ ,' [XIV, 1, 3, 29](sbe44119.htm#14:1:3:29).\n\n[463:2](sbe44119.htm#fr_1237) That is, by dividing the sheaths in the middle\nlengthwise, and lighting both halves in the Garhapatya fire.\n\n[463:3](sbe44119.htm#fr_1238) According to Katy. XXVI, 3, 5 he makes a span\n(of thumb and index)--or spreads his hand with the palm downwards--over the\npot whilst muttering the respective formulas; apparently changing the position\nof the hand according to the point of the compass referred to in the formula.\n\n[464:1](sbe44119.htm#fr_1239) Or, calling for the ' _s_ rausha _t_ '; cf. part\ni, p. 131, note 2. The masculine form of the participle is somewhat peculiar\nas the term it is meant to explain refers to the earth. It has probably to be\nunderstood in the sense of, 'where he (viz. the Adhvaryu) calls for the _s_\nrausha _t_.' Mahidhara explains the term 'a _s_ ruti' by 'where they, the\npriests, utter the sacrificial calls,' i.e. 'meet for sacrifice.'\n\n[465:1](sbe44119.htm#fr_1240) Here the masculine gender can hardly be\nunderstood otherwise than in the sense 'where (B _ri_ haspati, or Brahman)\ndisposes on high.' Mahidhara takes no notice of this interpretation of the\nBrahma _n_ a, but explains 'vidh _ri_ ti' as either 'one who upholds\n(dharayati) in an especial manner,' or where 'the offering spoon, &c., is held\nupwards (uparish _t_ ad dhriyate,--? who holds it upwards),'--an explanation\nwhich can hardly commend itself.\n\n[465:2](sbe44119.htm#fr_1241) This specification of the number seems to have\nno other object but that of limiting the general term of 'Fathers,' or\ndeceased ancestors, to the specific signification it has at the _S_ raddha,\nwhere offering is made to the father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.\n\n[465:3](sbe44119.htm#fr_1242) According to Katy. XXVI, 3, 8, he does so whilst\nspanning the earth north of the Mahavira pot.\n\n[466:1](sbe44119.htm#fr_1243) That is, along the north and the south sides of\nthe pot, on the burning sheaths of reed grass; or rather on hot cinders heaped\nthereon. Katy. XXVI, 3, 9. They would partly serve the purpose of the ordinary\n(three) enclosing-sticks; and \xc3\x82past., indeed, calls them 'paridhi.'\n\n[466:2](sbe44119.htm#fr_1244) Literally, the call of 'hail!' (svaha-kara) he\nmakes to be the nearer, and the deity the farther.\n\n[466:3](sbe44119.htm#fr_1245) That is, along the west and the east sides of\nthe pot. According to \xc3\x82past. _S_ r. XV, 8, 1-4, two pieces of wood are laid\ndown alternately by the Adhvaryu and the Pratiprasthat _ri_ , the last pieces\nbeing then laid down (on the south side) by the former priest.\n\n[467:1](sbe44119.htm#fr_1246) They consist of pieces cut from the black\nantelope-skin (with black and white hair, according to \xc3\x82past. XV, 5,12),\nfastened to sticks.\n\n[467:2](sbe44119.htm#fr_1247) That is, the Adhvaryu, Pratiprasthat _ri_ , and\nAgnidh then take each one of the fans, and move round the fire whilst keeping\nit on their left side (the Agnidh going in front).\n\n[467:3](sbe44119.htm#fr_1248) See p. 465, note 2.\n\n[468:1](sbe44119.htm#fr_1249) That is, apparently, red-hot, glowing ( _s_ u\n_k_ ita), or perhaps, entirely ablaze, enveloped in flames--outside as well as\ninside, owing to the ghee with which it was greased all over; hence hardly,\n'bestrahlt' (illumined shone upon), as the St. Petersb. Dict. takes it; cf.\n_s_ u _s_ u _k_ ana, [XIV, 2, 1, 18](sbe44121.htm#14:2:1:18); [3, 1,\n14](sbe44123.htm#14:3:1:14). According to \xc3\x82past. _S_ r., the three priests,\nhaving completed their circumambulation, sit down on the east, south, and\nnorth side respectively, and continue to fan the pot, at the same time oiling\nit with ghee, until the pot is ablaze, when the Adhvaryu takes off the gold\nplate. According to Katy., on the other hand, the Pratiprasthat _ri_ proceeds\nwith the baking of the cakes, whilst the Adhvaryu sprinkles the pot with ghee\neach time that the Hot _ri_ , in his recitation, utters the syllable 'om' at\nthe end of a verse. Before the last verse, the twenty-fifth, of the same hymn\nconcluding the first part of the recitation, a special verse, IX, 83, 3, is\ninserted. \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_ r. IV, 6, 2-3.\n\n[468:2](sbe44119.htm#fr_1250) See [p. 458](sbe44118.htm#page_458), note\n[1](sbe44118.htm#fn_1211).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIV, 1, 4. Fourth Brahma _n_ a](sbe44120.htm)\n\n"
