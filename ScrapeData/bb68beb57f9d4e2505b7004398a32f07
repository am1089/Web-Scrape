And because the qualities desired to be expressed are possible (in\nBrahman; therefore the passage refers to Brahman).\n\np. 110\n\nAlthough in the Veda which is not the work of man no wish in the strict sense\ncan be expressed 1, there being no speaker, still such phrases as 'desired to\nbe expressed,' may be figuratively used on account of the result, viz.\n(mental) comprehension. For just as in ordinary language we speak of something\nwhich is intimated by a word and is to be received (by the hearer as the\nmeaning of the word), as 'desired to be expressed;' so in the Veda also\nwhatever is denoted as that which is to be received is 'desired to be\nexpressed,' everything else 'not desired to be expressed.' What is to be\nreceived as the meaning of a Vedic sentence, and what not, is inferred from\nthe general purport of the passage. Those qualities which are here desired to\nbe expressed, i.e. intimated as qualities to be dwelt on in meditation, viz.\nthe qualities of having true purposes, &c. are possible in the highest\nBrahman; for the quality of having true purposes may be ascribed to the\nhighest Self which possesses unimpeded power over the creation, subsistence,\nand reabsorption of this world. Similarly the qualities of having true desires\nand true purposes are attributed to the highest Self in another passage, viz.\nthe one beginning, 'The Self which is free from sin' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 7, 1).\nThe clause, 'He whose Self is the ether,' means 'he whose Self is like the\nether;' for Brahman may be said to be like the ether on account of its\nomnipresence and other qualities. This is also expressed by the clause,\n'Greater than the earth.' And the other explanation also, according to which\nthe passage means 'he whose Self is the ether' is possible, since Brahman\nwhich as the cause of the whole world is the Self of everything is also the\nSelf of the ether. For the same reasons he is called 'he to whom all works\nbelong, and so on.' Thus the qualities here intimated as topics of meditation\nagree with the nature of Brahman. We further maintain that the terms\n'consisting of mind,' and 'having breath for its body,' which the purvapakshin\nasserts\n\np. 111\n\ncannot refer to Brahman, may refer to it. For as Brahman is the Self of\neverything, qualities such as consisting of mind and the like, which belong to\nthe individual soul, belong to Brahman also. Accordingly _S_ ruti and Sm _ri_\nti say of Brahman, 'Thou art woman, thou art man; thou art youth, thou art\nmaiden; thou as an old man totterest along on thy staff; thou art born with\nthy face turned everywhere' ( _S_ ve. Up. IV, 3), and 'its hands and feet are\neverywhere, its eyes and head are everywhere, its ears are everywhere, it\nstands encompassing all in the world' (Bha. Gita III, 13).\n\nThe passage (quoted above against our view), 'Without breath, without mind,\npure,' refers to the pure (unrelated) Brahman. The terms 'consisting of mind;\nhaving breath for its body,' on the other hand, refer to Brahman as\ndistinguished by qualities. Hence, as the qualities mentioned are possible in\nBrahman, we conclude that the highest Brahman only is represented as the\nobject of meditation.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[110:1](sbe34039.htm#fr_142) The discussion is brought on by the term\n'vivakshita' in the Sutra whose meaning is 'expressed, aimed at,' but more\nliterally 'desired to be expressed.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2, 3](sbe34040.htm)\n\n"
