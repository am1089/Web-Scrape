It is the stepping stone of the Yogi, or in other words the\nfoundation, the helpmate of the Yogi in controlling his enemies--freeing him\nfrom diseases. The Pranayama is the means by which the Yogi masters\nlevitation, walks upon the water, and also the means of living buried alive\nfor years. Pranayama is the Master Key by which Yogis open the door of\nliberation, and master all the forces.\n\nPranayama is the best method for suffering humanity to overcome diseases,\nconquer fear, overcome nervousness or despondency. It opens the door of\nBlessed Peace, it gives hope to the hopeless, power to the poor, faith to the\nfaithless. There is no other way to control the mind, as mind is nothing\nwithout desire or thought; desires and thoughts are nothing without Prana.\n\nWhat is Prana? Prana is everything. "Prana is Fire; Prana is the Sun; the\nCloud; the Wind; Prana is the Killer of Demons;\n\np. 51\n\n[paragraph continues] Prana is the Earth. It is what is and is not, immortal.\n* * * Prana is the center of everything. "--Prasna Upanishad.\n\nPrana is like the forces of electricity. Everything that moves is moved by\nPrana. Prana moves the lungs, then air goes in and out as breath. Prana is\nback of everything as force. The mind is lord of the senses and the organs--\nthe Prana is lord of the mind: The mind is the motor--the Prana is the power\nthat moves the motor.\n\nThe Prana is the great power of the Mother Kundalini. From the Prana there are\nborn other Pranas, namely,--Apana, Samana, Vyana, and Udana. These are in the\nvarious parts of the body, but Prana is the power back of All and All.\n\nHow do Yogis control this power? By Pranayama. Prana is the Vital or life\nforce--Yama, how to control it. This is why Yogis call Pranayama the stepping\nstone, or helpmate.\n\nLet us see what H. Y. Pradipika, the most famous, says: "When the breath is\nirregular, the mind wanders, but when the breath is under control the mind is\nalso under control. Because of this, Yogis live as long as they want to."\n\np. 52\n\nEveryone should learn to control the breath, by the practice of Pranayama.\n"Man lives as long as he has breath in his body. When the breath goes out he\nis said to be dead."\n\n"As long as the Nadis (nerves) are not pure, the Prana can not go through the\nSushumna, and as long as Prana does not go through the Sushumna there is no\nsuccess for the Yogi. As soon as the Nadis are purified, the Yogi succeeds in\ndoing Pranayama, and then his body becomes slender and light. This is the sign\nof Pranayama success, for then the Prana goes through the Sushumna.\n\n"There is no success without purification of the Nadis, and there is no\npurification of the Nadis without Pranayama.\n\n"The Brahma (God of Creation), devotes himself to the practice of Pranayama,\nand is free from the fear of death.\n\n"When Prana goes through the Sushumna, the mind becomes one-pointed. This is\ncalled Unmani Avastha (the steadiness of the mind).\n\n"It is through the practice of Pranayama Yoga, that Yogi attains Sidhis\n(master over\n\np. 53\n\n[paragraph continues] Nature\'s Forces, Levitation, etc.).\n\n"By forcing the Prana downward and raising the Apana upward, the Yogi becomes\nyoung, though he be old in years."\n\nThere are eight different Pranayamas, that should be learned from a teacher\nwho has mastered them. Any of the Pranayama practice can cure the diseases of\nthe nervous system, as countless testimonial letters on file will show, as\nRev. A. K. Burkland, Miss E. Lindsay and others.\n\nThe same authority says further: "When Pranayama, called Kevala Kumbhaka, has\nbeen mastered, there is nothing in the three worlds that can not be attained."\n\nIt is by the power of Pranayama that the Yogis do the wonderful feats of\nlevitation, walking on water, etc. This is not their goal--they only want\nliberation--but there is no liberation without awakening the Kundalini.\n\nIf the busy people of the world will practice Pranayama just a few months,\nthey will be happily surprised to see its effect upon the body and mind. The\nbody will become light and active. Idleness will vanish like darkness before\nthe light.\n\nPranayama is easy to practice. Any one\n\np. 54\n\ncan do it, the young, the old, diseased or maimed. It is the key to\neverlasting youth.\n\n"Pranayama will have a wonderfully soothing effect on one whenever they are at\nwar with themselves. They will gain instantaneous peace. Is the world going\nhard with you? Do you feel you are losing out in the race of life? Then I say,\npractice Pranayama; after the practice you will emerge wonderfully renewed and\nrenascent, ready to forge ahead in the battle of life, with new vigour, new\nfaith in yourself and new hope. Are you face to face with a problem that\nrequires a cool brain and clear thinking, profound and mature judgement? My\nadvice to you is that before tackling the problem, attain mental poise by\npracticing Pranayama. There is nothing like it for giving poise, peace and\nbalance. In the midst of the greatest stress and storm, in the thick of the\nbattle, steady yourself for a supreme effort by practicing Pranayama. Practice\nthis daily without fail, and you will notice how marvelously, your mental,\nphysical and spiritual powers, are developed. You will then always be master\nof yourself and of the situation. You will always have a tremendous amount of\nsurplus energy, mentally, physically\n\np. 55\n\nand spiritually, upon which to draw.\n\n"This will make your life natural and peaceful, free from nervous exhaustion\nand worry, because it will enable you to keep your vital force of life ever\nrenewed and [reinforced](errata.htm#7). It will enable you to charge your\nbattery, to electrify it every day. Today you resemble a small boat tossing on\nthe waves of a stormy life without oars, at the mercy of wind and wave, always\nin danger of rocks and shoals. Practice Pranayama and you will plough thru the\nvast sea of life like a giant dreadnought.\n\n"Learn Pranayama--practice Pranayama, and be master of yourself and your\ncircumstances."
