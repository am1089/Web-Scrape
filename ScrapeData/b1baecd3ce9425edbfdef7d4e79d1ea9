Uddalaka \xc3\x82ru _n_ i said to his son _S_ vetaketu:\n\nLearn from me the true nature of sleep (svapna). When a man sleeps here, then,\nmy dear son, he becomes united with the True 2, he is gone to his\n\np. 99\n\nown (Self). Therefore they say, svapiti, he sleeps, because he is gone (apita)\nto his own (sva) 1.\n\n2\\. 'As a bird when tied by a string flies first in every direction, and\nfinding no rest anywhere, settles down at last on the very place where it is\nfastened, exactly in the same manner, my son, that mind (the _g_ iva, or\nliving Self in the mind, see VI, 3, 2), after flying in every direction, and\nfinding no rest anywhere, settles down on breath 2; for indeed, my son, mind\nis fastened to breath.\n\n3\\. 'Learn from me, my son, what are hunger and thirst. When a man is thus\nsaid to be hungry, water is carrying away (digests) what has been eaten by\nhim. Therefore as they speak of a cow-leader (go-naya), a horse-leader (a _s_\nva-naya), a man-leader (purusha-naya), so they call water (which digests food\nand causes hunger) food-leader (a _s_ a-naya). Thus (by food digested &c.), my\nson, know this offshoot (the body) to be brought forth, for this (body) could\nnot be without a root (cause).\n\n4\\. 'And where could its root be except in food (earth) 3? And in the same\nmanner, my son, as\n\np. 100\n\nfood (earth) too is an offshoot, seek after its root, viz. water. And as water\ntoo is an offshoot, seek after its root, viz. fire. And as fire too is an\noffshoot, seek after its root, viz. the True. Yes, all these creatures, my\nson, have their root in the True, they dwell in the True, they rest in the\nTrue.\n\n5\\. 'When a man is thus said to be thirsty, fire carries away what has been\ndrunk by him. Therefore as they speak of a cow-leader (go-naya), of a horse-\nleader (a _s_ va-naya), of a man-leader (purusha-naya), so they call fire\nudanya, thirst, i. e. water-leader. Thus (by water digested &c.), my son, know\nthis offshoot (the body) to be brought forth: this (body) could not be without\na root (cause).\n\n6\\. 'And where could its root be except in water? As water is an offshoot,\nseek after its root, viz. fire. As fire is an offshoot, seek after its root,\nviz. the True. Yes, all these creatures, O son, have their root in the True,\nthey dwell in the True, they rest in the True.\n\n'And how these three beings (devata), fire, water, earth, O son, when they\nreach man, become each of them tripartite, has been said before (VI, 4, 7).\nWhen a man departs from hence, his speech 1 is merged\n\np. 101\n\nin his mind, his mind in his breath, his breath in heat (fire), heat in the\nHighest Being.\n\n7\\. 'Now that which is that subtile essence (the root of all), in it all that\nexists has its self. It is the True. It is the Self, and thou, O _S_ vetaketu,\nart it.'\n\n'Please, Sir, inform me still more,' said the son.\n\n'Be it so, my child,' the father replied.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[98:2](sbe01126.htm#fr_284) The deep sushupta sleep is meant, in which\npersonal consciousness is lost, and the self for a time absorbed in the\nHighest Self. Sleep is produced by fatigue. Speech, mind, and the senses rest,\nbreath only remains awake, and the _g_ iva, the living soul, in order to\nrecover from his fatigue, returns for a while to his true Self (atma). The Sat\nmust be taken as a substance, nay, as the highest substance or subject, the\nBrahman. The whole purpose of the Upanishad is obscured if we translate sat or\nsatyam by truth, instead of the True, the true one,\xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb8 \xe1\xbd\x84\xce\xbd\xcf\x84\xcf\x89\xcf\x82 \xe1\xbd\x84\xce\xbd.\n\n[99:1](sbe01126.htm#fr_285) This is one of the many recognised plays on words\nin the Upanishads and the Vedanta philosophy. Svapiti, he sleeps, stands for\nsva (his own), i.e. the self, and apita, gone to.\n\n[99:2](sbe01126.htm#fr_286) The commentator takes pra _n_ a here in the sense\nof Sat, which it often has elsewhere. If so, this illustration would have the\nsame object as the preceding one. If we took pra _n_ a in the sense of breath,\nbreath being the result of water, this paragraph might be taken to explain the\nresignation of the living Self to its bondage to breath, while on earth.\n\n[99:3](sbe01126.htm#fr_287) That food is the root of the body is shown by the\ncommentator in the following way: Food when softened by water and digested\nbecomes a fluid, blood ( _s_ onita). From it comes flesh, from flesh fat, from\nfat bones, from bones marrow, from marrow seed. Food eaten by a woman becomes\nequally blood (lohita), p. 100 and from seed and blood combined the new body\nis produced. We must always have before us the genealogical table:--\n\nSat, \xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb8 \xe1\xbd\x84\xce\xbd.  \n  |  \nTegas (fire) = Va _k_ (speech).  \n  |  \nAp (water) = Pra _n_ a (breath).  \n  |  \nAnna (earth)= Manas (mind).\n\n[100:1](sbe01126.htm#fr_288) If a man dies, the first thing which his friends\nsay is, He speaks no more. Then, he understands no more. Then, he moves no\nmore. Then, he is cold.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 9](sbe01127.htm)\n\n"
