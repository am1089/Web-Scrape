Now we will explain the rule of the most holy Aghamarsha _n_ a. 1\n\n2\\. He goes to a bathing-place and bathes (there). Dressed in a pure dress let\nhim raise, close to the water, an altar, and moistening his clothes by one\n(application of water), and filling his hand once (with water), let him recite\nthe Aghamarsha _n_ a hymn (in the manner of his daily) private recitation. 2\n\n3\\. (Let him repeat it) one hundred times in the morning, one hundred times at\nmidday, and one hundred times or an unlimited number of times in the\nafternoon.\n\n4\\. When the stars have risen, let him partake of gruel prepared of one\nhandful of barley.\n\n5\\. After seven (days and) nights he is freed from all minor sins (upapataka),\nwhether they have been committed intentionally or unintentionally, after\ntwelve (days and) nights (from all other sins) excepting the murder of a\nlearned Brahma _n_ a, the violation of a Guru's bed, stealing gold, and\ndrinking Sura. 5\n\n6\\. After twenty-one (days and) nights he over-comes even those (crimes) and\nconquers them.\n\np. 297\n\n7\\. He overcomes everything, he conquers all, he obtains the reward of all\nsacrifices, he has bathed at all sacred bathing-places, he has performed the\nvows required for (the study of) all the Vedas, he becomes known to all the\ngods, he sanctifies a company (of Brahma _n_ as) by merely looking (at them),\nand his undertakings are successful. Thus speaks Baudhayana. 7\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[296:1](sbe1477.htm#fr_1356) **5**. Vasish _th_ a XXVI, S.\n\n[296:2](sbe1477.htm#fr_1357) Stha _n_ _d_ ila, 'an altar,' is a slightly\nraised mound of earth, which, according to Govinda, in this case must have the\nshape of the sun's disc. According to the same authority the hand of the\nperformer must remain filled with water as long as the recitation lasts, and\nthe perform, stands behind the altar facing the east.\n\n[296:5](sbe1477.htm#fr_1358) Regarding the pras _ri_ tiyavaka, '(subsisting\non) gruel prepared from a handful of barley,' see below, III, 6.\n\n[297:7](sbe1477.htm#fr_1359) Govinda is of opinion that the words, 'thus\nspeaks Baudhayana,' indicate that this part of the work has been composed by a\npupil or some other person.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na III, Adhyaya 6](sbe1478.htm)\n\n"
