Should it be said 'on account of difference'; not so, because with\nreference to each the text says what is not that.\n\nBut, an objection is raised, we observe, that the individual soul also,\nalthough in reality possessing the same twofold attributes, viz. freedom from\nall evil and so on, as we learn from the teaching of Pra _g_ apati ( _Kh_. Up.\nVIII, 7), yet is affected with imperfections owing to the fact that it is\n\np. 609\n\nconnected with bodies, divine, human, and so on, and thus undergoes a variety\nof conditions. Analogously we cannot avoid the conclusion that the inner Ruler\nalso, although in reality possessing those same twofold attributes, is also\naffected by imperfection, because through its connexion with those different\nbodies it likewise undergoes a variety of conditions.--This objection the\nSutra sets aside in the words, 'not so, because with reference to each the\ntext says what is not that,' i.e. what is contrary. For where the text says\nthat the inner Ruler dwells within the earth, within the soul, within the eye,\nand so on, it concludes each clause by saying, 'that is thy Self, the inner\nRuler, the immortal one,' i.e. declares the inner Ruler to be immortal, and\nthus denies of him any imperfections due to his connexion with the bodies\nwhich he voluntarily enters in order to rule them. The true (perfect) nature\nof the individual soul, on the other hand, is obscured as long as it is\nconnected with a body, as we have explained under III, 2, 5.--But, as the\nPurvapakshin has pointed out, even if the highest Self voluntarily enters into\nbodies, it cannot escape connexion with the imperfections which depend on the\nessential nature of those bodies.--Not so, we reply. The fact is, that not\neven non-sentient things are, essentially or intrinsically, bad; but in\naccordance with the nature of the works of those beings which are under the\nrule of karman, one thing, owing to the will of the Supreme Person, causes\npain to one man at one time and pleasure at another time, and causes pleasure\nor pain to one person and the opposite to another person. If the effects of\nthings depended on their own nature only, everything would at all times be\nproductive for all persons, either of pleasure only or of pain only. But this\nis not observed to be the case. In agreement herewith Sm _ri_ ti says,\n'Because one and the same thing causes pain and pleasure and envy and wrath,\nthe nature of a thing cannot lie in itself. As the same thing which erst gave\nrise to love causes pain later on, and that which once caused anger now causes\nsatisfaction, nothing is in itself of the nature either of pleasure or of\npain.' To the soul therefore which is subject\n\np. 610\n\nto karman the connexion with different things is the source of imperfection\nand suffering, in agreement with the nature of its works; while to the highest\nBrahman, which is subject to itself only, the same connexion is the source of\nplayful sport, consisting therein that he in various ways guides and rules\nthose things.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 13.
