A king and a Brahma _n_ a, deeply versed in the Vedas, these two, uphold\nthe moral order in the world. 1\n\n2\\. On them depends the existence of the fourfold human race, of internally\nconscious beings, of those which move on feet and on wings, and of those which\ncreep, 2\n\np. 215\n\n3\\. (As well as) the protection of offspring, the prevention of the confusion\n(of the castes and) the sacred law. 3\n\n4\\. He is (called) deeply versed in the Vedas, 4\n\n5\\. Who is acquainted with the (ways of the) world, the Vedas (and their)\nA\xe1\xb9\x85gas (auxiliary sciences),\n\n6\\. Who is skilled in disputations (and), in (reciting) legends and the Pura\n_n_ a,\n\n7\\. Who looks to these (alone), and lives according to these,\n\n8\\. Who has been sanctified by the forty sacraments (sa _m_ skara), 8\n\n9\\. Who is constantly engaged in the three occupations (prescribed for all\ntwice-born men), 9\n\n10\\. Or in the six (occupations prescribed specially for a Brahma _n_ a), 10\n\n11\\. (And) who is well versed in the duties of 11\n\np. 216\n\ndaily life settled by the agreement (of those who know the law).\n\n12\\. (Such a Brahma _n_ a) must be allowed by the king immunity from (the\nfollowing) six (kinds of opprobrious treatment): 12\n\n13\\. (I.e.) he must not be subjected to corporal punishment, he must not be\nimprisoned, he must not be fined, he must not be exiled, he must not be\nreviled, nor be excluded.\n\n14\\. The Garbhadhana (or ceremony to cause conception), the Pu _m_ savana (or\nceremony to cause the birth of a male child), the Simantonnayana (or arranging\nthe parting of the pregnant wife\'s hair), the _G_ atakarman (or ceremony on\nthe birth of the child), the ceremony of naming the child, the first feeding,\nthe _K_ aula (or tonsure of the head of the child), the initiation, 14\n\n15\\. The four vows (undertaken) for the study of the Veda, 15\n\n16\\. The bath (on completion of the studentship), 16\n\np. 217\n\nthe taking of a help-mate for the fulfilment of the religious duties, the\nperformance of the five sacrifices to gods, manes, men, goblins, and Brahman,\n\n17\\. And (the performance) of the following (sacrifices):\n\n18\\. The seven kinds of Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as (or small sacrifices),viz. the Ash\n_t_ aka, the Parva _n_ a Sthalipaka, offered on the new and full moon days),\nthe funeral oblations, the Srava _n_ i, the \xc3\x82grahaya _n_ i, the _K_ aitri, and\nthe \xc3\x82svayu _g_ i; 18\n\n19\\. The seven kinds of Havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as, viz. the Agnyadheya, the\nAgnihotra, the Dar _s_ apaur _n_ amasas, the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a, the _K_ aturmasyas,\nthe Niru _dh_ apa _s_ ubandha, and the Sautrama _n_ i; 19\n\n20\\. The seven kinds of Soma-sacrifices, viz. the Agnish _t_ oma, the\nAtyagnish _t_ oma, the Ukthya, the Sho _d_ a _s_ in, the Atiratra, and the\nAptoryama;\n\n21\\. These are the forty sacraments.\n\n22\\. Now (follow) the eight good qualities of the soul, 22\n\np. 218\n\n23\\. (Viz.) compassion on all creatures, forbearance, freedom from anger,\npurity, quietism, auspiciousness, freedom from avarice, and freedom from\ncovetousness. 23\n\n24\\. He who is sanctified by these forty sacraments, but whose soul is\ndestitute of the eight good qualities, will not be united with Brahman, nor\ndoes he reach his heaven.\n\n25\\. But he, forsooth, who is sanctified by a few only of these forty\nsacraments, and whose soul is endowed with the eight excellent qualities, will\nbe united with Brahman, and will dwell in his heaven.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[214:1](sbe0272.htm#fr_1015) **VIII**. _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a V, 4, 4, 5;\nWeber, Ind. Stud. X, 29. Haradatta explains vrata, \' moral order,\' by karma\n_n_ i, \'the rites and occupations,\' and loka, \'world,\' by rash _t_ ra,\n\'kingdom.\' Ultimately my translation and his explanation come to the same\nthing. He adds that the king upholds order by punishing, and a learned Brahma\n_n_ a by teaching. Regarding the excellence of these two, see also Manu IV,\n135.\n\n[214:2](sbe0272.htm#fr_1016) \'Internally conscious beings, i.e. trees and the\nlike, which are immovable, but grow and decay. For such possess internal\nconsciousness only, no corresponding external faculty of acting. . . . The\nexistence of these, i.e. of men and the rest, depends upon, i.e. is\nsubordinate to the king and to a Brahma _n_ a deeply versed in the Vedas. How\nis that? As regards the Brahma _n_ a, an offering which has been properly\nthrown into the fire reaches the sun; from the sun comes rain; from rain food\nis produced and thereon live the creatures. By this reasoning he is shown to\np. 215 be the cause of their existence. But the king is (also) the cause of\ntheir existence; for he punishes robbers and the like.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[215:3](sbe0272.htm#fr_1017) Haradatta takes prasutiraksha _n_ am, \'the\nprotection of their offspring,\' as a copulative compound, and explains it by\ntheir prosperity (abhiv _ri_ ddhi) and their protection.\' But a\nsamaharadvandva is here out of place.\n\n[215:4](sbe0272.htm#fr_1018) Macnaghten, Mitakshara I, 2, 27. \'By the word\nloka, "the world," are intended the laws of countries and the like, which may\nbe learnt from the practice of the world.\'--Haradatta. Regarding the A\xe1\xb9\x85gas,\nsee \xc3\x82pastamba II, 4, 8, 10.\n\n[215:8](sbe0272.htm#fr_1019) Regarding the forty sacraments, see below, Sutras\n14-20.\n\n[215:9](sbe0272.htm#fr_1020) Regarding the three occupations, common to all\ntwice-born men, see below, X, 1.\n\n[215:10](sbe0272.htm#fr_1021) See below, X, 2.\n\n[215:11](sbe0272.htm#fr_1022) The Samaya _k_ arika or Smarta duties are those\ntaught in the Dharma-sutras and Sm _ri_ tis, see \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 1, 1, and Max\n\'Muller\'s History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 101.\n\n[216:12](sbe0272.htm#fr_1023) See Weber, Ind. Stud. X, V, 60, 66; Macnaghten,\nMitakshara I, 2, 27.\n\n[216:14](sbe0272.htm#fr_1024) Regarding the Sa _m_ skaras mentioned in this\nSutra, see \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana G _ri_ hya-sutra I, 13-23; _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana G _ri_ hya-\nsutra I, 19-II, 5; Paraskara G _ri_ hya-sutra I, 13-11, 2.\n\n[216:15](sbe0272.htm#fr_1025) The four vows, as Haradatta states, are,\naccording to \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana, the Mahanamnivrata, the Mahavrata, the Upanishad-\nvrata, and the Godana; see \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana _S_ rauta-sutra VIII, 14, where the\nfirst three are described in detail, and G _ri_ hya-sutra I, 22, 3, with the\ncommentary thereon. Other G _ri_ hya-sutras give more and different names, see\nH. Oldenberg, _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana G _ri_ hya-sutra II, 11-12 (S. B.

See also Max Muller, History of Ancient\nSanskrit Literature, p. 203. The Ash _t_ akas are sacrifices offered on the\neighth day of the dark halves of the winter months, and of those of the dewy\nseason, i.e. Karttika, Marga _s_ iras, Pausha, and Magha. The Srava _n_ i is\noffered on the full moon day of the month of Srava _n_ a, the \xc3\x82grahaya _n_ i\non the fourteenth, or on the full moon day of Marga _s_ iras, the _K_ aitri on\nthe full moon day of the _K_ aitra, and the \xc3\x82svayu _g_ i on the full moon day\nof the month \xc3\x82 _s_ vayu _g_ a or \xc3\x82 _s_ vina.\n\n[217:19](sbe0272.htm#fr_1028)-20. The Havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as and Soma-sacrifices\nare described in the Brahma _n_ as and _S_ rauta-sutras. Havis denotes any\nkind of food used for oblations, such as clarified butter, milk, rice meat,\n&c.\n\n[217:22](sbe0272.htm#fr_1029) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 8, 23, 6.\n\n[218:23](sbe0272.htm#fr_1030) Haradatta explains ma\xe1\xb9\x85galya, \'auspiciousness,\'\nto mean always doing what is praised (by good men) and avoiding what is blamed\nby them.\' Anayasa, \'quietism,\' means, according to him, avoiding to undertake\nthat which causes pain to oneself, even though it be a duty.\'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter IX](sbe0273.htm)\n\n'
