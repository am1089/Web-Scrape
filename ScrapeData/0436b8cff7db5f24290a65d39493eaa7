Should it be objected that on account of conduct (the assumption of a\nremainder is not needed), we deny this because (the scriptural expression\n'conduct') is meant to connote (the remainder); so Karsh _n_ a _g_ ini thinks.\n\nBut--an objection may be raised--the scriptural passage, which has been quoted\nfor the purpose of proving that the existence of a remainder of works ('those\nwhose conduct has been good,' &c.), declares that the quality of the new birth\ndepends on _k_ ara _n_ a, not on anu _s_ aya. Now _k_ ara _n_ a and anu _s_\naya are different things; for _k_ ara _n_ a is the same as _k_ aritra, a _k_\nara, _s_ ila, all of which mean conduct 1, while anu _s_ aya denotes work\nremaining from requited work. Scripture also speaks of actions and conduct as\ndifferent things, 'According as he acts and according as he conducts himself\nso will he be' (B _ri_ , Up. IV, 4, 5); and 'Whatever\n\np. 120\n\nworks are blameless those should be regarded, not others; whatever our good\nconduct was that should be observed by thee' (Taitt. Up. I, 11, 2). From the\npassage which proclaims the dependence of the quality of birth on conduct the\nexistence of an unrequited remainder of works cannot therefore be proved.--\nThis objection is without force, we reply, because the scriptural term\n'conduct' is meant to connote the remainder of the works. This is the opinion\nof the teacher Karsh _n_ a _g_ ini.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[119:1](sbe38085.htm#fr_93) _S_ ila also means here 'conduct' only, as we see\nfrom its being co-ordinated with _k_ ara _n_ a, _k_ aritra, &c.; not\ncharacter.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 1, 10](sbe38086.htm)\n\n"
