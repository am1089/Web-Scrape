A disciple\nmay mean many things, but Keshub Chunder Sen was never chary in giving credit\nwhere credit was due, and he was the last man to withhold the name of master\nand teacher from Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a or any one else from whom he had received\ninspiration, encouragement, or instruction. 'Whoever he may be,' he writes, 'I\ndesire to learn from him. If I see an ordinary minstrel, I love to learn at\nhis feet. If an ascetic comes, I consider that a lac of rupees has come to my\nhouse. I learn much by hearing his hymns. . . . I can clearly perceive that\nwhen-ever a saint takes leave of me he pours into my heart his virtues. To\nsome extent I become like him-- _I am a born disciple_.' On the other hand, no\none repudiated the title of Master or Guru more emphatically than Ramak _ri_\nsh _n_ a. A relative of Keshub Chunder Sen, however, who evidently completely\nmisapprehended what was implied by the influence which I said that Ramak _ri_\nsh _n_ a had exercised on Keshub Chunder Sen, Mozoomdar, and others as his\ndisciples, is very anxious to establish the priority of Keshub Chunder Sen, as\nif there could be priority in philosophical or religious truth. 'It was Keshub\nChunder,' he tells us, 'who brought Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a out of obscurity.'\nThat may be so, but how often have disciples been instrumental in bringing out\ntheir master? He then continues to bring charges against Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a,\nwhich may be true or not, but have nothing\n\np. 67\n\nto do with the true relation between Keshub and Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a. If, as we\nare told, he did not show sufficient moral abhorrence of prostitutes, he does\nnot stand quite alone in this among the founders of religion. If he did not\n'honour the principle of teetotalism according to Western notions,' no one, as\nfar as I know, has ever accused him of any excess in drinking. Such bickerings\nand cavillings would have been most distasteful both to Keshub Chunder Sen and\nto Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a. Both had no words but words of praise and love for\neach other, and it was a great pity that their mutual relation should have\nbeen treated in a jealous spirit, and thereby totally misrepresented. I can\nunder-stand that in India, where the relation between Guru and _S_ ishya is a\nvery peculiar and very definite one, one of Keshub Chunder Sen's relatives\nshould have objected to Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a being represented as the Guru of\nKeshub. Keshub had no real Guru, nor was he a Brahman by birth like Ramak _ri_\nsh _n_ a. But that he learnt from Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a he, as well as\nMozoomdar, has repeatedly admitted. As to myself, I can only say that Keshub\nChunder Sen's memory is quite safe in my hands, perhaps safer than in those of\nhis relatives. I stood up for him when his nearest friends forsook him and\nturned against him. If my words could possibly have been misunderstood in\nIndia, I gladly state that neither did Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a act as Guru or\nKeshub Chunder Sen as _S_ ishya. The only thing that interested me was whether\nthe influence exercised by the former on the latter might possibly account for\ncertain, as yet unexplained, phases in the later spiritual development of\nKeshub Chunder Sen.\n\np. 68\n\n[paragraph continues] It would be a real help in judging of Keshub Chunder Sen\nif we knew that--to quote the words of Mozoomdar--' his association with Ramak\n_ri_ sh _n_ a developed the conception of the Motherhood of God'; or, again,\nthat 'the strange selectivism of Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a suggested to Keshub's\nappreciative mind the thought of broadening the spiritual structure of his own\nmovement.' Whether toward the end of his life Keshub became mystic and\necstatic in his utterances, and whether his concept of the Godhead as the\nDivine Mother was inspired by Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a, I gladly leave to others to\ndecide. By whatever terms these words mystic and ecstatic may be, if\ntranslated into Bengali, in English they mean exactly that spirit which\npervades many of the utterances of the so-called New Dispensation, and which\nwas so severely, and far too severely, animadverted on by many of Keshub's\nEuropean admirers. Mystic has no such terrible meaning in English as its\ncorresponding term seems to have in Bengali. People always seem to imagine\nthat mystic has something to do with mist. Thus the late B. R. Rajam Iyer\nwrote in the Prabuddha Bharata, p. 123:\n\nThe Vedanta will certainly be mysticism if it seek to make a man live without\nfood, enable him to preserve his life as long as he pleases, or get stiff like\na corpse, dead entirely to the world, though an obscure spark of life may yet\nlinger in the system. The Vedanta will be mysticism if it seek to enable man\nto work wonderful feats, as flying in the air, leaving the body at will, and\nwandering in space unobstructed like a ghost, or entering into the bodies of\nothers, and possessing them like spirits, and doing similar things\n\np. 69\n\nof an unnatural character. The Vedanta will certainly be mysticism if it seek\nto make a man read the thoughts of others, and lay him in an eternal trance,\nwhen he would be more dead than alive, both with reference to himself and to\nothers.' I quote these words partly to show the misapplication of the term\nmysticism, for all this should not be called mysticism, but fraud and\njugglery; and partly to show what the Vedanta is not, and certainly never was,\nin the eyes of Keshub Chunder Sen or Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a. It was in order to\nexpress my conviction that some later phases in Keshub's so-called New\nDispensation were not essential to his simple original teaching, that I tried\nto trace them back to their different sources. If some of Ramak _ri_ sh _n_\na's followers have made capital out of these remarks, surely such local\njealousies and backbitings may safely be ignored. An honest under-standing\nbetween East and West, which was one of Keshub's highest ideals, cannot be\nfurthered by the somewhat childish misunderstandings of Keshub's self-\nconstituted advocates. Keshub himself would have been the last person to\napprove of the spirit that pervades his friend's passionate, though, I trust,\nwell-intentioned advocacy.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Vedanta-philosophy](rls20.htm)\n\n"
