Raja Yoga, on the contrary, deals entirely with the mind and psychic\npower and may be called the science of applied psychology. Its aim is to\nremove all mental obstructions and to gain a perfectly controlled, healthy\nmind. The main purpose of its training is to develop and strengthen the will\nas well as the power of concentration, and to lead the seeker after Truth\nthrough the path\n\np. 64\n\nof concentration and meditation to the ultimate goal of all religion.\n\nThis path is called Raja Yoga or the Royal method (Raja means "king") because\nthe power of concentration and will-power are not only greater than any\nphysical force, but are essential to the acquisition of all other powers. The\nman who possesses a vigorous mind controlled by a well-developed will, with\nstrong power of concentration, can easily become the master of physical nature\nand in a short time attain the realization of Truth; and it is the special\nprovince of Raja Yoga to teach how this can be accomplished. Its study has\nbeen encouraged by all those who have come in contact with the Raja Yogis of\nIndia either in ancient or modern times. It was extolled by Pythagoras, by\nPlato and the Neo-Platonists like Plotinus and Proclus, by the Gnostics and\nthe Christian\n\np. 65\n\nmystics of the middle ages; and even to-day it is in some measure practiced by\nsome of the Roman Catholic monks and nuns of the higher orders. Spinoza, Kant,\nSchopenhauer, Ralph Waldo Emerson, spoke in praise of it, declaring its object\nto be the unravelling of the mystery of the nature of the human soul and the\nenfoldment of the latent powers existing in each individual. It has been\nproved by the living example of Yogis that through its practice that power can\nbe acquired by which all other forces in the universe may be controlled; and\nRaja Yoga claims that whoever has gained mastery over his mind, can govern all\nthe phenomena of nature.\n\nIt teaches that mind is the sovereign power of the universe, and that when its\nforces are properly concentrated upon any particular object, the true nature\nof that object will be revealed. Instead of using\n\np. 66\n\nan instrument, if we properly utilize the mental powers which we already\npossess, and focus them absolutely upon one point, we can easily know all the\nparticulars regarding the thing upon which they are directed. This object may\nbe physical, mental, or spiritual. The concentrated mind of a Yogi may be\ncompared to an electric search-light. By throwing the converged rays of his\nmind toward a distant object, whether gross or subtile, all the details of\nthat object are illumined and made known to him. The vision of ordinary\npersons is not so penetrating because their mental forces are dissipated like\nthe scattered rays of an ordinary light In the same way, if the mind can be\nconcentrated upon internal objects or upon truths that exist in the realm of\nthe universal, perfect knowledge of those things can be acquired.\n\nThus it becomes evident that the power,\n\np. 67\n\nof concentration is greater than sense-power, or than that which can be gained\nby the help of instruments. If we can develop it by controlling our mental\nfaculties, by making the mind introspective, and by checking all distractions\nwhich draw the mind outside; and can direct our concentrated mental energy\ntoward our higher Self, the true nature of the individual ego will be\nrevealed, and we shall realize that our immutable Self is the Soul of all, and\nthat it is the same as the ultimate Reality of the universe. We shall then\nperceive that the Divine Being, whom in ignorance we worship as separate from\nourselves, is not far from us, is not dwelling outside of us, but is our own\nomnipotent Self residing within us. We shall also recognize that the same\nSpirit is one and all-pervading, and that it is the Absolute Truth underlying\nthe name and form of every phenomenal\n\np. 68\n\nobject. This knowledge will emancipate the soul from the bondage of ignorance.\n\nRaja Yoga maintains that the outer world exists only in relation to the inner\nnature of each individual. What mind is to itself, the phenomenal world of\nsense-perception is to the mind. The external is only the reflection of the\ninternal; that which we gain, that which we receive, is only the likeness or\nreflection of that which we have already given. Mental phenomena are merely\nthe effects of invisible forces, which cannot be discovered by the senses or\nby any instrument which the human mind can invent. We may try forever to know\nthese finer forces through the medium of our sense-perceptions, but we shall\nnever arrive at any satisfactory result. A Raja Yogi understands this and\ntherefore attaches little value to instruments.\n\np. 69\n\n[paragraph continues] He does not depend upon his sense-powers, but endeavors\nto gain all knowledge through the power of concentration. The science of Raja\nYoga gives the various steps which lead to the attainment of this ideal. It\nexplains clearly and scientifically the processes and methods by which\nconcentration can be developed. It does not, however, ask the student to\naccept anything on hearsay, or to believe anything on the mere authority of\nscriptures or of writers. But it states certain facts, requests the student to\nexperiment, experience the results, and draw his own conclusions.\n\nThere is nothing mysterious in the system of Raja Yoga. On the contrary, it\npoints out the laws which govern so-called mysteries and explains under what\nconditions the phenomena of mysteries are produced. It shows that so long as\nthe\n\np. 70\n\nreal cause of an event is unknown it appears mysterious to us. Standing upon\nthe solid ground of logic and reason, the science of Raja Yoga unravels the\nriddles of the universe and directs the individual soul toward the attainment\nof the final end of all religions. Its principles are highly moral and\nuplifting. It helps the student to understand the true purpose of life and\ndescribes the way by which it may be fulfilled here and now. Raja Yoga tells\nus that we should not think so much of what will happen after death, but that\nwe should make the best use of the present and unfold the latent powers which\nwe already possess, while it reminds us again and again of the fact that the\nadvancement made in this life will be the foundation of future progress. If we\ngain or develop certain powers before we die, those powers will not be lost,\nbut will remain with us wherever we go\n\np. 71\n\nafter death; while external possessions, we know, cannot accompany us in the\ngrave. The only things that we can carry out of life are our character, our\nexperience and the knowledge gained therefrom. They are our real possessions;\nand it is these which Raja Yoga will help us to develop; since its chief\nobject is to mould the character and lead the student to the knowledge of the\ndivine nature of the soul. The methods which it teaches can be practiced\nwithout joining any secret organization, but merely by following the\ndirections of a true Raja Yogi, who is pure and simple, whose mind is free\nfrom doubts, and who is unattached to the objects of the phenomenal plane.\n\nThe practice of Raja Yoga is divided into eight steps. The first four are the\nsame as those of Hatha Yoga. The first and second, Yama and Niyama, include\nall\n\np. 72\n\nthe ethical laws that govern our moral nature. The strict observance of these\nlaws is necessary to the practice of the other steps of Raja Yoga. All the\nfundamental principles of ethics expounded by Buddha and all the truths\nproclaimed in the Sermon on the Mount are contained in these first two steps.\nA beginner in the practice of Raja Yoga should live a strictly moral and pure\nlife, otherwise he will not advance in this path, nor will he reach the\nhighest Truth or realize the Divinity that dwells within him. A neophyte must\nremember that purity, chastity, and morality are the very cornerstones of the\nstructure of the Science of Yoga. In the requirements of the first step we\nfind non-killing, non-stealing, truthfulness, continence, forgivingness,\nfirmness of character, kindness to all living creatures, simplicity,\nmoderation in diet, and cleanliness. Non-killing\n\np. 73\n\nmust be in thought, word, and deed, so with truthfulness and non-stealing. The\ncharacter must be firm, for the student must persist in the face of all\nobstacles until spiritual perfection is reached. He must not take up the study\nas a passing fad, only to satisfy his momentary curiosity, but must continue\nwith patience and perseverance until the highest ideal is realized.\n\nThe second step includes austerities, forbearance, contentment, faith in the\nSupreme Being, charity, study, and self-surrender to the Divine will. All the\nphysical exercises necessary for keeping the body in perfect condition are to\nbe found in the third step. 1 Health is essential to the attainment of the\nhighest knowledge. Those who are suffering from disease cannot\n\np. 74\n\nmake their mind steady, cannot fix their attention upon truths existing on the\nspiritual plane, because naturally their minds will be centered on the\ndiseased parts of the body. A beginner, who possesses a healthy body and a\nwell-balanced mind, should choose any _As ana_ or posture of the body in which\nhe can sit firmly for a long time without feeling pain in the limbs. In the\npractice of Raja Yoga, however, one need not be so particular regarding the\nposture of the body. The student should simply observe that the spinal column\nis kept perfectly straight while practicing breathing lessons in a sitting\nposture.\n\nPranayama, or breathing exercises, constitute the fourth step. The practice of\ncertain breathing exercises will remove many obstacles like dullness,\nlaziness, and bodily weakness, and will be helpful in\n\np. 75\n\ngaining control over the senses, sense organs, and nerve centers, as also in\nquieting the restlessness of the mind. Anyone who will practice such breathing\nexercises regularly, will acquire wonderful power over both his mind and his\nbody. He who suffers from worry, anxiety, nervousness, or insomnia, can obtain\nexcellent results even in a few days by the practice of proper breathing\nexercises. Those who have studied the science of breathing will know what\nthese results are; but the main object of the Pranayama in Raja Yoga is to\ndevelop the power of concentration.\n\nMaking the mind introspective is the fifth step. It is called Pratyahara. If\nwe can withdraw the mind from external objects, fix it on some inner object,\nand bring it under the control of the will, we shall accomplish all that is\nrequired in this step. Pratyahara is preparatory to concentration.\n\np. 76\n\n[paragraph continues] Before the student is able to concentrate on any\nparticular object he must learn to gather up his scattered mental powers. This\nprocess of collecting the powers of the mind and of restraining it from going\nout to external objects is what the Yogis designate as Pratyahara.\n\nConcentration follows next. After going through the five preliminary steps, if\none takes up concentration, the results achieved will be extraordinary. Those,\nhowever, who have not practiced the introductory steps will find this one\nextremely difficult, for the ground must be prepared before good results can\nbe gained.\n\nMeditation is the seventh stage, 1 and through it one passes into Samadhi or\nthe state of superconsciousness, which is the\n\np. 77\n\neighth and last step. In this state the sixth sense of finer perception is\ndeveloped, the spiritual eye is opened, and one comes face to face with the\nDivine Being dwelling within. In it the student realizes that his true Self is\none with the universal Spirit, and he receives all the revelation and all the\ninspiration that can possibly come to the human soul. It may be thought by\nmany that revelation proceeds from some external source, either through the\nfavor of some angel or bright spirit or the extra-cosmic personal God, but a\nYogi knows that revelation or inspiration is the disclosure of the higher Self\nwithin, and that the realization of spiritual truths comes to that soul which\nhas reached the eighth step of Raja Yoga. Ceaseless effort, persistence, and\nperseverance in practice are necessary to attain to the state of\nsuperconsciousness. That\n\np. 78\n\nwhich is realized in it cannot be revealed by\n\nintellect or by any other mental faculty; therefore it is said that Truth\ncannot be attained by reading books or Scriptures, or by intellect or sense-\nperception, but by reaching the state of superconsciousness. Those who are\nlonging to know the Truth, who are searching for the ultimate Reality of the\nuniverse, and are not satisfied with the knowledge gained through the senses\nor through the aid of instruments, should struggle hard to go into Samadhi,\nbecause through it alone will they discover their ideal and reach the abode of\nhappiness. Before, however, they can arrive at this state, they will have to\nfollow faithfully the different steps already enumerated and with patience and\nperseverance overcome all the obstacles which beset the way.\n\nThere are many obstructions to Samadhi, such as grief, disease, mental\nlaziness,\n\np. 79\n\ndoubt, cessation of the struggle to attain Samadhi, heaviness of body and\nmind, thirst for worldly things, false knowledge, non-attaining concentration,\nfalling away from the state once attained, irregular breathing, etc. They can\nbe easily avoided by regular practice under the guidance of a Yogi teacher. If\na student try to practice by himself any of the exercises as given in Raja\nYoga, 1 he may have some unpleasant experiences which may disturb his mind or\nnervous system; but if he have an experienced Raja Yogi to direct him, then he\nwill have no difficulty in conquering all the obstacles and dangers, and in\nreaching the right destination. Some of the powers generated by these\npractices are too dangerous to be handled by an inexperienced student; they\nmay not only\n\np. 80\n\ninjure him but may even drive him to insanity. There have, indeed, been many\nsuch cases among those who have tried to practice without the help of a well-\nqualified Guru or spiritual teacher.\n\nHaving removed all obstructions in this path, the student should be confident\nthat he is approaching the final goal of Raja Yoga. When the superconscious\nrealization is acquired all doubts will cease forever, all questions\nconcerning the nature of the soul will be answered, the search after Truth\nwill stop, the mind will become tranquil, and the soul will be emancipated\nfrom the bondage of ignorance and self-delusion. The Yogi will never again\nfall a victim to the attractions of the world or be distracted by objects of\nsense. The whole universe will appear to him as the play-ground of the Divine\nBeing; and he will constantly feel that his body and mind are\n\np. 81\n\nlike instruments moving under the direction of the Almighty Will which is\nmanifesting through all forms. Thus, having gained spiritual strength and\nillumination, he will become the conqueror of himself and the master of nature\neven in this life.\n\n"He alone has reached happiness on this earth, he alone has conquered the\nworld, who has gained perfect control over his mind and body, whose soul rests\nin tranquillity, and whose eyes behold Divinity in everything and everything\nin that Eternal Being, which is the Infinite Abode of existence, knowledge,\nand bliss absolute."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[73:1](hby06.htm#fr_1) It is called _As ana_ in Sanskrit.
