Its oldest element is a worship of nature-\ndeities, such as the Sky-Father, Earth-Mother, Dawn, etc., who were inherited\nfrom the time before the division of the Indo-European stocks. These figures,\nhowever, are not as a rule living forces in religion; for the most part they\nare kept alive merely by conservatism and poetic convention. The most real\ngods of the Vedic pantheon are peculiarly Indian. Often indeed a distant\nconnection can be traced between them and nature-deities in the other Indo-\nEuropean races; but their myths and\n\np. 14\n\nlegends have undergone a long process of development on Indian soil, by which\nthey have acquired the characteristic stamp of the Hindu genius. But even in\nthe naturalistic polytheism of this mythology we can trace in the \xe1\xb9\x9aig-veda,\nespecially in its later parts, a tendency towards a pantheism merging all\nbeing into a Supreme Spirit of vaguely defined character, a primal Infinite.\n\nThus "there is one Existence, sages call it by many names" (\xe1\xb9\x9aig-veda, I.\nclxiv. 46; cf. x. cxiv. 5). The primitive spirit and source of being is called\n_Hira \xe1\xb9\x87ya-garbha_ ("Germ of Gold"), or Praj\xc4\x81-pati ("Lord of Creatures"), x.\ncxxi.; as his own firstborn he enters the universe created by him (x. lxxii.,\nlxxxii., etc.). In x. cxxix. the first Being is neither existent nor non-\nexistent, a watery void, from which arose a primal Unity, whence sprang Desire\nas first bond between being and non-being. Another poet (x. xc.) tells how the\nuniverse arose from _Purusha,_ "Man," that is, an ideal human sacrifice\noffered by the gods. For as, to the Vedic mind, a sacrifice is a power\ncontrolling Nature, and the human sacrifice is the most powerful of all, then\nthe greatest of all forces, the cosmogonic energies, must have arisen from an\nideal offering of this kind made by the highest agents, the gods.\n\nTo the demand of philosophy for a final and absolute Reality beyond the\ntemporary and merely relative reality of phenomenal experience\n\np. 15\n\nthe Vedic poets thus gave almost the same answer as the early Greek thinkers.\nThey asserted, in very diverse and often very mystic terms, the existence of a\nsingle cosmic matter or World-Spirit, whom they styled variously _Praj \xc4\x81-pati,\nBrahm\xc4\x81_ (masculine), _Purusha, Hira \xe1\xb9\x87aya-garbha,_ etc.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Brahma and Prana](brk08.htm)\n\n'
