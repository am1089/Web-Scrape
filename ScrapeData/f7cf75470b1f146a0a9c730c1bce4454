[1882], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n1:3:2\n\n### SECOND BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n1:3:2:11\\. Now the sacrifice is the man. The sacrifice is the man for the\nreason that the man spreads (performs) it; and that in being spread it is made\nof exactly the same extent as the man 1: this is the reason why the sacrifice\nis the man.\n\n1:3:2:22\\. The _g_ uhu (spoon) further belongs to that (man-shaped sacrifice),\nand so does the upabh _ri_ t; and the dhruva 2 represents its trunk. Now it is\nfrom the\n\np. 79\n\ntrunk that all these limbs proceed, and for this reason the entire sacrifice\nproceeds from the dhruva.\n\n1:3:2:33\\. The dipping-spoon (sruva, masc.) is no other than the breath. This\nbreath passes through (or, goes to) all the limbs, and for that reason the\ndipping-spoon goes to all the offering-spoons (sru _k_ , fem.).\n\n1:3:2:44\\. That _g_ uhu further is to him no other than yonder sky, and the\nupabh _ri_ t this atmosphere, and the dhruva this same (earth). Now it is from\nthis (earth) that all the worlds originate: and from the dhruva, therefore,\nthe whole sacrifice proceeds.\n\n1:3:2:55\\. The dipping-spoon then is no other than that blowing one (the\nwind); it is this that sweeps across all these worlds: and for that reason the\nsruva goes to all the offering-spoons.\n\n1:3:2:66\\. Now when this sacrifice is being performed, it is performed for the\ngods, the seasons, and the metres (or sacred texts). To the gods belongs what\nsacrificial food there is, to wit, king Soma and the sacrificial cake: all\nthis he takes, while announcing it with the formula, 'I take thee, agreeable\nto so and so!' for thus it becomes theirs.\n\n1:3:2:77\\. And whatever oblations of butter are taken, they are taken for the\nseasons and the metres. Every one of them he takes in the form of butter\nwithout announcing it (to any particular deity). In the _g_ uhu he takes of it\nfour times (with the sruva from the pot), in the upabh _ri_ t eight times 1.\n\n1:3:2:88\\. Now when he takes of it four times (with the sruva) in the _g_ uhu,\nhe takes it for the seasons, since\n\np. 80\n\nhe takes it for the fore-offerings 1, and the fore-offerings are the seasons:\nall this he takes in the form of butter without making any announcement, in\norder to avoid sameness; for if he were to take it with the formulas 'For\nSpring (I take) thee!' 'For Summer--thee!' he would commit (the fault of) a\nrepetition 2: he therefore takes it in the form of butter without making any\nannouncement.\n\n1:3:2:99\\. When, on the other hand, he takes eight times (with the sruva) in\nthe upabh _ri_ t, he takes it for the metres 3, since it is for the after-\nofferings 1 that he takes it; and the after-offerings are the metres: all this\nhe takes in the form of butter without making any announcement, in order to\navoid sameness; for were he to take it with the formulas 'For the\nGayatri\\--thee!' 'For the Trish _t_ ubh--thee!' he would commit a repetition:\nhe therefore takes it in the form of butter without making any announcement.\n\n1:3:2:1010\\. Again, when he takes four times (with the sruva)\n\np. 81\n\nin the dhruva, he takes it for the whole sacrifice, and all this he takes in\nthe form of butter without making any announcement. To whom indeed should he\nannounce it, since he cuts it off for all the deities? He therefore takes it\nin the form of butter without making any announcement.\n\n1:3:2:1111\\. Now the sacrificer stands behind the _g_ uhu, and he who means\nevil to him stands behind the upabh _ri_ t. The eater stands behind the _g_\nuhu, and what (or, he who) is to be eaten stands behind the upabh _ri_ t. And\nthe _g_ uhu, indeed, is the eater, and the upabh _ri_ t is that which is to be\neaten. In the _g_ uhu he takes four times (with the sruva), and in the upabh\n_ri_ t eight times.\n\n1:3:2:1212\\. Now when he takes four times (butter) in the _g_ uhu, he thereby\nmakes the eater more limited, smaller; and when he takes eight times in the\nupabh _ri_ t, he makes that which is to be eaten more unlimited, more\nabundant: for a flourishing condition indeed exists where the eater is smaller\nand that which is to be eaten more abundant.\n\n1:3:2:1313\\. In taking four times in the _g_ uhu, he takes (altogether) more\nbutter, and in taking eight times in the upabh _ri_ t he takes less butter.\n\n1:3:2:1414\\. For when, in taking four times (butter with the sruva) in the _g_\nuhu, he takes more butter, he thereby, in making the eater more limited,\nsmaller, imparts vigour and strength to him. And when, in taking eight times\nin the upabh _ri_ t, he takes less butter, he thereby, in making that which\n(or, him who) is to be eaten more unlimited, more abundant, makes it (or, him)\nvigourless and weaker. And thus a king who has established himself among a\nnumberless people, subdues them even from a single dwelling,\n\np. 82\n\nand takes possession of whatever he likes 1: with that very same energy (the\nAdhvaryu acts) when he takes a greater quantity of butter in the _g_ uhu. Now\nwhat he takes in the _g_ uhu, that he offers with the _g_ uhu; and what he\ntakes in the upabh _ri_ t, that also he offers with the _g_ uhu.\n\n1:3:2:1515\\. And in reference to this point they say: 'Wherefore then is he to\ntake it in the upabh _ri_ t, if he does not offer it with the upabh _ri_ t?'\nNow, if he were to offer it with the upabh _ri_ t, those subjects (of the\nking) would assuredly become separated from him, nor would there be either an\neater or what is to be eaten. When, on the other hand, he pours (the butter)\ntogether and thus offers it with the _g_ uhu, thereby the people pay tribute\nto the Kshatriya. Hence by what he takes in the upabh _ri_ t, the Vai _s_ ya\n(man of the people), under the rule of the Kshatriya, becomes possessed of\ncattle; and when he pours (the butter) together and offers it with the _g_\nuhu, thereby the Kshatriya, whenever he likes, says, 'Hallo Vai _s_ ya, just\nbring to me what thou hast stored away!' Thus he both subdues him and obtains\npossession of anything he wishes by dint of this very energy.\n\n1:3:2:1616\\. These butter-portions, then, are taken for the metres. Now what\nhe takes in the _g_ uhu (by ladling) four times (with the sruva), that he\ntakes for the gayatri; and what he takes in the upabh _ri_ t (by ladling)\neight times, that he takes for the trish _t_ ubh and _g_ agati; and what he\ntakes in the dhruva (by\n\np. 83\n\nladling) four times, that he takes for the anush _t_ ubh. For the anush _t_\nubh is speech, and from speech all this (universe) springs: hence it is from\nthe dhruva that the whole sacrifice originates. The anush _t_ ubh also is this\n(earth), and from it all this (universe) originates: hence it is from the\ndhruva that the whole sacrifice originates.\n\n1:3:2:1717\\. He takes (butter with the sruva), with the text (Va _g_. S. I,\n31), 'Verily, thou art the favourite resort (or, dainty) of the gods!' He\nthereby makes that butter the most favourite resort of the gods: for this\nreason he says, 'verily, thou art the favourite resort of the gods!'--'An\nunassailable means of worship!' the butter is indeed a thunderbolt: therefore\nhe says, 'an unassailable means of worship!'\n\n1:3:2:1818\\. Once he puts (butter with the sruva) into the _g_ uhu with this\nformula, three times silently. With the same formula he puts (butter) once\ninto the upabh _ri_ t, seven times silently. With the same formula he puts\nonce (butter) into the dhruva, three times silently. Now, as to this, they\nsay, 'Thrice he should take with the formula in each case, for threefold is\nthe sacrifice.' Nevertheless (it is done) only once with each (spoon), for it\nis just in this way that the taking thrice (with a formula) is accomplished.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[78:1](sbe1213.htm#fr_236) The sacrifice is the representation of the\nsacrificer himself; and hence its dimensions are to be those of a man, viz.\nthe altar (vedi) on its western side is to measure a fathom, or space between\nthe extreme ends of the outstretched arms (? of the sacrificer), which is\nsupposed to be equal to the size of a man; see I, 2, 5, 14. Originally these\nmeasurements were no doubt relative to the size of the sacrificer; but it is\ndoubtful whether this was still the case at the time of our author.\n\n[78:2](sbe1213.htm#fr_237) For a description of these spoons, see [p.\n67](sbe1211.htm#page_67), note [2](sbe1212.htm#fn_207). The _g_ uhu is\nsupposed to represent the right, and the upabh _ri_ t the left arm, and the\ndhruva the trunk.\n\n[79:1](sbe1213.htm#fr_238) He takes butter in the _g_ uhu and upabh _ri_ t by\nfour or eight ladlings with the dipping-spoon. As we learn further on, the\nquantity taken in the _g_ uhu, by ladling four times, should exceed that in\nthe upabh _ri_ t, although the latter requires eight ladlings. Cf. Katy. II,\n7, 13.\n\n[80:1](sbe1213.htm#fr_242) On the praya _g_ as, or oblations of clarified\nbutter introductory to, and the anuya _g_ as, oblations of the same material\nmade subsequently to, the chief sacrifice, see I, 5, 3, 1 seq., and I, 8, 2, 1\nseq.\n\n[80:2](sbe1213.htm#fr_240) Repetition of one and the same sacrificial act on\nthe same day is to be avoided, as far as possible. The repetition in the\npresent case would consist in his announcing the butter-oblations to the\nseveral deities in the same way as he has done in regard to the rice-portions.\nSee I, 1, 2, 17-18.\n\n[80:3](sbe1213.htm#fr_241) On the frequent symbolical employment of the metres\nin the ritual, as the embodiment of supreme harmony and the efficacy of\nprayer, see Weber, Ind. Stud. VIII, 8 seq. The three principal Vedic metres\nare the gayatri (three times eight syllables), the trish _t_ ubh (four times\neleven syllables), and the _g_ agati (four times twelve syllables); and three\nanuya _g_ as there are at these sacrifices, viz. to the barhis or sacrificial\ngrass, to Nara _s_ a _m_ sa and Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t respectively. In the\npresent instance (see par. 16) the trish _t_ ubh and _g_ agati metres are\ntaken together as one, and as a fourth is added the anush _t_ ubh (four times\neight syllables).\n\n[82:1](sbe1213.htm#fr_243) Tasmad uta ra _g_ apara _m_ vi _s_ am pravasayapy\nekave _s_ manaiva ('by one who has a single dwelling, i.e. by himself,' Saya\n_n_ a) _g_ inati tvad yatha tvat kamayate tatha sa _k_ ate. The MS. of the Ka\n_n_ va text has: 'Tasmat kshatriyo ra _g_ otaparad vi _s_ am pravasaya _g_\ninati tvad yatha tva(t) kamayate tat karoti.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 3.
