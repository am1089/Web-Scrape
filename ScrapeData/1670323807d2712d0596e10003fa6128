(The view that the agnis constitute an independent vidya) cannot be\nrefuted, owing to the greater force of direct enunciation and so on.\n\nOur opponent has no right to determine, on the ground of prakara _n_ a, that\nthe agnis are subordinate to the sacrificial action, and so to set aside our\nview according to which they are independent. For we know from the Purva Mima\n_m_ sa that direct enunciation ( _S_ ruti), indicatory mark\n\np. 263\n\n[paragraph continues] (li\xe1\xb9\x85ga), and syntactical connexion (vakya) are of\ngreater force than leading subject-matter (prakara _n_ a), and all those three\nmeans of proof are seen to confirm our view of the agnis being independent. In\nthe first place we have the direct enunciation, 'These agnis are indeed\nknowledge-piled only.' In the second place we have the indicatory mark\nsupplied by the passage, 'All beings ever pile for him sleeping,' &c. And in\nthe third place we have the sentence, 'By knowledge indeed those (agnis) are\npiled for him who thus knows.'\n\nIn the first of these passages the emphatical expression, 'built by knowledge\nonly,' would be contradicted if we admitted that the agnis form part of the\nsacrificial action.--But may this emphatical phrase not merely have the\npurpose of indicating that those agnis are not to be accomplished by external\nmeans?--No, we reply, for if that were intended, it would be sufficient to\nglorify the fact of knowledge constituting the character of the agnis by means\nof the word 'knowledge-piled,' and the emphatical assertion (implied in the\naddition of the word 'only') would be useless. For it is the nature of such\nagnis to be accomplished without any external means. But, although the agnis\nare clearly to be accomplished without external means, yet it might be\nsupposed that, like the mental cup, they form part of the sacrificial action,\nand the object of the emphatical assertion implied in 'only' is to discard\nthat suspicion.--So likewise (to pass over to li\xe1\xb9\x85ga) the continuity of action\nimplied in the passage, 'For him who thus knows whether sleeping or waking all\nbeings always pile these agnis,' is possible only on the supposition of those\nagnis being independent. The case is analogous to that of the imaginary\nagnihotra consisting of speech and breath, with reference to which the text\nsays at first, 'He offers his breath in his speech, he offers his speech in\nhis breath,' and then adds, 'These two endless and immortal oblations he\noffers always whether waking or sleeping' (Kau. Up. II, 6).--If, on the other\nhand, the imaginary agnis were parts of the sacrificial action it would be\nimpossible for them to be accomplished continually, since\n\np. 264\n\nthe accomplishment of the sacrificial action itself occupies only a short\ntime.--Nor may we suppose the passage (which contains the li\xe1\xb9\x85ga) to be a mere\narthavada-passage (in which case, as the purvapakshin avers, the li\xe1\xb9\x85ga would\nbe unable to refute prakara _n_ a). For in those cases where we meet with an\nunmistakeable injunctory passage--marked out as such by the use of the\noptative or imperative form--there indeed we may assume a glorificatory\npassage (met with in connexion with that injunctory passage) to be an\narthavada. In the present case, however, we observe no clear injunctory\npassage, and should therefore be obliged to construct one enjoining the\nknowledge of the various fanciful agnis, merely on the basis of the arthavada-\npassage. But in that case the injunction can be framed only in accordance with\nthe arthavada, and as the arthavada speaks of the continual building of the\nagnis, the latter item would have to appear in the injunction also. But, if\nso, it follows (as shown above) that the mental construction of those agnis\nconstitutes an independent vidya (and does not form part of the actual agni\n_k_ ayana).--The same argumentation applies to the second li\xe1\xb9\x85ga-passage quoted\nabove, 'Whatever those beings conceive in their minds,' &c.--And the sentence\nfinally shows, by means of the clause, 'For him who thus knows,' that those\nagnis are connected with a special class of men (viz. those who thus know),\nand are therefore not to be connected with the sacrificial action.--For all\nthese reasons the view of those agnis constituting an independent vidya is\npreferable.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 50](sbe38193.htm)\n\n"
