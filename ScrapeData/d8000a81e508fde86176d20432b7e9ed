And (the case of Brahman is) like that of gods and other beings in\nordinary experience.\n\nWell, let it be admitted that milk and other non-intelligent things have the\npower of turning themselves into sour milk, &c. without any extraneous means,\nsince it is thus observed. But we observe, on the other hand, that intelligent\nagents, as, for instance, potters, proceed to their several work only after\nhaving provided themselves with a complete set of instruments. How then can it\nbe supposed that Brahman, which is likewise of an intelligent nature, should\nproceed without any auxiliary?\n\nWe reply, 'Like gods and others.' As gods, fathers, _ri_ shis, and other\nbeings of great power, who are all of intelligent nature, are seen to create\nmany and various objects, such as palaces, chariots, &c., without availing\nthemselves of any\n\np. 348\n\nextraneous means, by their mere intention, which is effective in consequence\nof those beings' peculiar power--a fact vouchsafed by mantras, arthavadas,\nitihasas, and pura _n_ as;--and as the spider emits out of itself the threads\nof its web; and as the female crane conceives without a male; and as the lotus\nwanders from one pond to another without any means of conveyance; so the\nintelligent Brahman also may be assumed to create the world by itself without\nextraneous means.\n\nPerhaps our opponent will argue against all this in the following style.--The\ngods and other beings, whom you have quoted as parallel instances, are really\nof a nature different from that of Brahman. For the material causes operative\nin the production of palaces and other material things are the bodies of the\ngods, and not their intelligent Selfs. And the web of the spider is produced\nfrom its saliva which, owing to the spider's devouring small insects, acquires\na certain degree of consistency. And the female crane conceives from hearing\nthe sound of thunder. And the lotus flower indeed derives from its indwelling\nintelligent principle the impulse of movement, but is not able actually to\nmove in so far as it is a merely intelligent being 1; it rather wanders from\npond to pond by means of its non-intelligent body, just as the creeper climbs\nup the tree.--Hence all these illustrative examples cannot be applied to the\ncase of Brahman.\n\nTo this we reply, that we meant to show merely that the case of Brahman is\ndifferent from that of potters and similar agents. For while potters, &c., on\nthe one side, and gods, &c., on the other side, possess the common attribute\nof intelligence, potters require for their work extraneous means (i.e. means\nlying outside their bodies) and gods do not. Hence Brahman also, although\nintelligent, is assumed to require no extraneous means. So much only we wanted\nto show by the parallel instance of the gods, &c. Our intention is to point\nout that a peculiarly conditioned capability which\n\np. 349\n\nis observed in some one case (as in that of the potter) is not necessarily to\nbe assumed in all other cases also.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[348:1](sbe34164.htm#fr_307) The right reading appears to be 'svayam eva _k_\netana' as found in some MSS.
