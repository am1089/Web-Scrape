And on account of the statement of the assumption (of a metaphor) there\nis nothing contrary to reason (in a _g_ a denoting the causal matter); just as\nin the case of honey (denoting the sun) and similar cases.\n\nThe word a _g_ a neither expresses that fire, water, and earth belong to the\ngoat species, nor is it to be explained as meaning 'unborn;' it rather\nexpresses an assumption, i.e. it intimates the assumption of the source of all\nbeings (which source comprises fire, water, and earth), being compared to a\nshe-goat. For as accidentally some she-goat might be partly red, partly white,\npartly black, and might have many young goats resembling her in colour, and as\nsome he-goat might love her and lie by her, while some other he-goat might\nleave her after having enjoyed her; so the universal causal matter which is\ntri-coloured, because comprising fire, water, and earth, produces many\ninanimate and animate beings similar to itself, and is enjoyed by the souls\nfettered by Nescience, while it is abandoned by those souls which have\nattained true knowledge.--Nor must we imagine that the distinction of\nindividual souls, which is implied in the preceding explanation, involves that\nreality of the multiplicity of souls which forms one of the tenets of other\nphilosophical schools. For the purport of the passage is to intimate, not the\nmultiplicity of souls, but the distinction of\n\np. 257\n\nthe states of bondage and release. This latter distinction is explained with\nreference to the multiplicity of souls as ordinarily conceived; that\nmultiplicity, however, depends altogether on limiting adjuncts, and is the\nunreal product of wrong knowledge merely; as we know from scriptural passages\nsuch as, 'He is the one God hidden in all beings, all-pervading, the Self in\nall beings,' &c.--The words 'like the honey' (in the Sutra) mean that just as\nthe sun, although not being honey, is represented as honey ( _Kh_. Up. III,\n1), and speech as a cow (B _ri_. Up. V, 8), and the heavenly world, &c. as the\nfires (B _ri_. Up. VI, 2, 9), so here the causal matter, although not being a\nshe-goat, is metaphorically represented as one. There is therefore nothing\ncontrary to reason in the circumstance of the term a _g_ a being used to\ndenote the aggregate of fire, water, and earth.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4, 11](sbe34122.htm)\n\n"
