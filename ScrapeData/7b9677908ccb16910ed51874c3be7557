Let us press Soma for _G_ atavedas [1](sbe46035.htm#an_1:99:1:1). May he\nburn down the property of the niggard [2](sbe46035.htm#an_1:99:1:2). May he,\nAgni, bring us across all troubles, across all difficulties, as across a\nstream with a boat.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe _Ri_ shi is Ka _s_ yapa Mari _k_ a. Metre, Trish _t_ ubh.--Verse 1 = T\xc3\x82.\nX, 1.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. This is one of the very rare passages in which Agni standing alone and\nnot accompanied by Indra or the Maruts &c. is mentioned as drinking Soma. It\nseems as if this verse were not composed for the regular Soma sacrifice, but\nfor a special occasion.\n\nNote 2. Cf. Delbruck, Syntakt.
