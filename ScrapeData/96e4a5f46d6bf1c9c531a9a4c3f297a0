And of him who is chaste; for in Scripture (this is declared).\n\nThe knowledge of Brahman belongs to those who have to observe chastity, and\nmen living in that state have not to perform the Agnihotra, the Dar _s_ apur\n_n_ amasa, and similar works. For this reason also knowledge cannot be\nsubsidiary to works.--But, it may be objected, there is no such condition of\nlife; for texts such as 'he is to perform the Agnihotra as long as he lives,'\ndeclare men to be obliged to perform sacrifices and the like up to the end of\ntheir lives, and Sm _ri_ ti texts contradicting Scripture have no authority.--\nTo meet this the Sutra adds 'for in Scripture.' The three stages of life are\nrecognised in Scripture only; cp. texts such as 'Those who in the forest\npractise penance and faith' ( _Kh_. Up. V, 10, 1); 'Wishing for that\n\np. 694\n\nworld only mendicants wander forth from their homes' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 22).\nThe text as to the lifelong obligatoriness of the Agnihotra is valid for those\nonly who do not retire from worldly life.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 18.
