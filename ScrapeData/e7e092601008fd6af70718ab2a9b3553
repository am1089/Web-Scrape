It is a meritorious act to plant and\nwater them, and such is the respect cherished for them, that even their\nwithered branches are not allowed to be burnt. The\n\n[![THE BANYAN TREE.](tn/46900.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/46900.jpg)  \nTHE BANYAN TREE.  \n\nsame ceremonies are observed at the planting of these trees, or, when they\nhave been taken care of for some time, at their consecration, as are observed\nat the setting up of an image. The following are the names of the sacred\ntrees:--\n\np. 470\n\nThe Asvatta, or Pipul. Tree ( _Ficus religiosa_ ), sacred to Vishnu.\n\nThe Vata, Banyan or Indian Fig Tree * ( _Ficus Indica_ ), also sacred to\nVishnu.\n\nThe Vilva, or Wood-apple, or B\xc4\x93l Tree ( _\xc3\x86 gle Marmelos_), sacred to Siva.\n\nThe Vakula ( _Mimusops Elengi_ ).\n\nThe Harlt\xc4\x81ki ( _Terminalia chebula_ ).\n\n[![THE B\xc4\x92L.](tn/47000.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/47000.jpg)  \nTHE B\xc4\x92L.  \n\nThe Amalaki, or _Emblic Myrobalans_ ( _Phyllanthus emblica_ ).\n\nThe Nimba, or Nim Tree ( _Melia azadirachta_ ).\n\nThe Tulsi ( _Ocimum gratissimum_ or _sanctum_ ).\n\nThe Tulsi is very commonly worshipped by the followers of Vishnu; and the\nplant is most carefully tended\n\np. 471\n\nas his representative. Every morning the ground near it is cleaned with cow-\ndung and water; at night a lamp is hung before it. During the two hottest\nmonths of the year, a vessel of water is hung over it so that it constantly\nreceives moisture. When a plant dies, it is cast into a river, the same honour\nbeing given to it as to an image as soon as the worship of it is concluded. It\nis a common custom to place a sprig of Tulsi near the head of a dying person.\nThe origin of the worship of this plant is said to be the following: A woman\nnamed Tulsi engaged in religious austerities for a long period, and asked, as\na boon, that she might become the wife of Vishnu. Lakshmi, hearing of this,\ncursed her, and changed her into the plant which bears her name. Vishnu,\nhowever, comforted his follower with the assurance that he would assume the\nform of the Sh\xc4\x81lgr\xc4\x81ma, and continue near her. * The V\xc4\x81yu and the Padma Pur\xc4\x81nas\nteach that the Tulsi was one of the products of the churning of the ocean.\n\nIn addition to these trees should be mentioned the _Durva_ grass ( _Agrostis\nlinearis_ ) and _Kusa_ grass ( _Poa cynosuro ides_), which form part of the\nofferings made to the gods; as do the leaves or flowers of most of the trees\npreviously mentioned. The Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata has a legend accounting for the\nsacredness of the Kusa grass. When Garuda brought some of the amrita from the\nmoon for the N\xc4\x81gas, or serpent deities, as the price to be paid for his\nmother's release from servitude, Indra tried to induce him not to give it to\nthem lest they, becoming immortal, should oust him from his throne. Garuda\nwould not consent to this arrangement, but told Indra that after it was given\nto them he could steal it.\n\np. 472\n\nGaruda therefore placed the amrita in a vessel on the grass, and whilst the\nN\xc4\x81gas were bathing, Indra stole it. They, thinking that the ambrosia must be\non the Kusa grass, licked it; the sharp spikes slit their tongues, and hence\nthe serpents' tongues are forked; and the grass, having been touched by the\namrita, is holy.\n\n[![THE FIG TREE.](tn/47200.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/47200.jpg)  \nTHE FIG TREE.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[470:*](hmvp46.htm#fr_440) See p. 472.\n\n[471:*](hmvp46.htm#fr_441) Ward, ii. 204.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter X.
