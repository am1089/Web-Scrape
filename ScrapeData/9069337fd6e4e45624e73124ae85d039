On the attainment of this (viz. Brahman) (there take place) the non-\nclinging and the destruction of later and earlier sins; this being declared\n(by scripture).\n\nThe supplement to the third adhyaya is finished herewith, and an inquiry now\nbegins concerning the fruit of the knowledge of Brahman.--The doubt here\npresents itself whether, on the attainment of Brahman, sins the results of\nwhich are opposed in nature to such attainment are extinguished or not. They\ncannot possibly be extinguished, the purvapakshin maintains, before they have\ngiven their results, because the purpose of all works is their result. For we\nunderstand from scripture that work possesses the power of producing results;\nif, therefore, the work would perish without the enjoyment of its result,\nscripture would thereby be rendered nugatory. Sm _ri_ ti also declares that\n'works do not perish.'--But from this it would follow that all scriptural\ninstruction regarding expiatory ceremonies is meaningless!--This objection is\nwithout force, we reply, because expiatory ceremonies may be viewed as merely\ndue to certain special occurrences; as is the case with the offering enjoined\non the occasion of the house (of one who has established the sacred fireplace)\nbeing burned 1.--Let us moreover admit that expiatory ceremonies, because\nenjoined on account of a person being afflicted by some mischief, may be meant\nto extinguish that mischief. But there is no analogous injunction of the\nknowledge of Brahman.--But if we do not admit that the works of him who knows\nBrahman are extinguished, it follows that he must necessarily enjoy the fruits\nof his works and thus cannot obtain release!--This follows by no means; but in\nthe same way as the results of works, release will take place in due\ndependence on place, time, and special causes.--For these reasons the\nobtainment of Brahman does not imply the cessation of (the consequences of)\nmisdeeds.\n\np. 354\n\nTo this we make the following reply. On the obtainment of Brahman there take\nplace the non-clinging (to the agent) of the posterior sins and the\nannihilation of anterior ones.--'On account of this being declared.' For in a\nchapter treating of the knowledge of Brahman scripture expressly declares that\nfuture sins which might be presumed to cling to the agent do not cling to him\nwho knows: 'As water docs not cling to a lotus-leaf, so no evil deed clings to\nhim who knows this' ( _Kh_. Up. IV, 34, 3). Similarly scripture declares the\ndestruction of previously accumulated evil deeds: 'As the fibres of the Ishika\nreed when thrown into the fire are burned, thus all his sins are burned' (\n_Kh_. Up. V, 24, 3). The extinction of works the following passage also\ndeclares, 'The fetter of the heart is broken, all doubts are solved,\nextinguished are all his works when He has been beheld who is high and low'\n(Mu. Up. II, 1, 8).--Nor is there any force in the averment that the\nassumption of works being extinguished without their fruits having been\nenjoyed would render scripture futile. For we by no means deny the fruit-\nproducing power of works; this power actually exists; but we maintain that it\nis counteracted by other causes such as knowledge. Scripture is concerned only\nwith the existence of this power in general, not with its obstruction and non-\nobstruction. Thus also the Sm _ri_ ti passage, 'For work is not extinguished,'\nexpresses the general rule; for as fruition of the result is the purpose of\nwork, work is not extinguished without such fruition. But it is assumed that\nevil deeds are extinguished through expiatory ceremonies and the like, on\naccount of scriptural and Sm _ri_ ti passages such as 'All sins transcends he,\nthe murder of a Brahma _n_ a transcends he who offers the a _s_ vamedha-\nsacrifice and who knows it thus' (Tai. Sa _m_ h. V, 3, 12, 1).--Nor is there\nany truth in the assertion that expiatory ceremonies are due to certain\nspecial occurrences (without possessing the power of extinguishing the evil\ninherent in such occurrences). For as these expiatory acts are enjoined in\nconnexion with evil events, we may assume that they have for their fruit the\ndestruction of such evil,\n\np. 355\n\nand are therefore not entitled to assume any other fruit.--Against the\nobjection that knowledge is not actually enjoined with reference to the\ndestruction of evil while expiatory acts are so enjoined, we make the\nfollowing remark. In the case of the meditations on the qualified Brahman\nthere exists such injunction, and the corresponding complementary passages\ndeclare that he who possesses such knowledge obtains lordly power and\ncessation of all sin. Now there is no reason why the passages should not\nexpressly aim at declaring these two things 1, and we therefore conclude that\nthe fruit of those vidyas is the acquisition of lordly power, preceded by the\nannulment of all sin. In the case of vidyas referring to Brahman devoid of\nqualities we indeed have no corresponding injunction; nevertheless the\ndestruction of all works follows from the cognition that our true Self is not\nan agent. (With relation to these vidyas about Brahman as devoid of qualities)\nthe term 'non-clinging' shows that, as far as future works are concerned, he\nwho knows Brahman does not enter at all into the state of agency. And as to\nworks past, although he has entered as it were into that state owing to wrong\nknowledge, yet those works also are dissolved when, through the power of know\nledge, wrong cognition comes to an end; this is conveyed by the term\n'destruction.' 'That Brahman whose nature it is to be at all times neither\nagent nor enjoyer. and which is thus opposed in being to the (soul's)\npreviously established state of agency and enjoyment, that Brahman am I; hence\nI neither was an agent nor an enjoyer at any previous time, nor am I such at\nthe present time, nor shall I be such at any future time;' this is the\ncognition of the man who knows Brahman. And in this way only final release is\npossible; for otherwise, i.e. if the chain of works which have been running on\nfrom eternity could not be cut short, release\n\np. 356\n\ncould never take place.--Nor can final release be dependent on locality, time,\nand special causes, as the fruit of works is; for therefrom it would follow\nthat the fruit of knowledge is non-permanent and cannot be.\n\nIt therefore is an established conclusion that on attaining Brahman there\nresults the extinction of all sin.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[353:1](sbe38274.htm#fr_217) Scripture enjoins the ish _t_ i in question\nmerely on the occasion of the house being burned, not as annulling the\nmischief done.\n\n[355:1](sbe38274.htm#fr_218) I.e. there is no reason to assume that those\npassages mention the acquisition of lordly power and the cessation of sin\nmerely for the purpose of glorifying the injunction, and not for the purpose\nof stating the result of our compliance with the injunction.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 1, 14](sbe38275.htm)\n\n"
