sent to me in manuscript. When the MS. came to be\nprinted there were several sayings which had been given twice. As these had to\nbe left out when they occurred the second time, it was necessary to assign two\nnumbers to some of the sayings in order not to disturb the figures of the\nIndex.\n\n\n\n"
