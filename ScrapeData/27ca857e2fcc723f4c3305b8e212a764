Let them choose (the place) which\nlies highest, and above which no other part of the ground rises 1; for it was\nfrom thence that the gods ascended to heaven, and he who is consecrated indeed\nascends to the gods. He thus sacrifices on a place of worship frequented by\nthe gods; but were any other part of the ground to rise above it, he would\nindeed be lowered while sacrificing: let them therefore choose (the place)\nwhich lies highest.\n\n3:1:1:22\\. While being high, that place should be even; and being even, it\nshould be firm; and being firm, it should incline towards the east, since the\neast is the quarter of the gods; or else it should incline\n\np. 2\n\ntowards the north, since the north is the quarter of men. It should rise\nsomewhat towards the south, that being the quarter of the Fathers. Were it to\nincline towards the south, the sacrifice would quickly go to yonder world; but\nin this way the sacrificer lives long: let it therefore rise somewhat towards\nthe south.\n\n3:1:1:33\\. Let not the measure of the sacrificial ground be exceeded on the\neast side, since such an excess would be in favour of his spiteful enemy. It\nmay be so in the south, and also in the north; but that place of worship alone\nis thoroughly efficient where the measure of the sacrificial ground is\nexceeded in the west; for to him (who possesses such a one) the higher 1\nworship of the gods readily inclines. So much as to the place of worship.\n\n3:1:1:44\\. Now Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya spake,--\'We went to choose a place of\nworship for Varsh _n_ ya 2. Satyaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a then said, "Verily, this whole\nearth is divine: on whatever part thereof one may sacrifice (for any\n\np. 3\n\none), after enclosing (and consecrating) it with a sacrificial formula, there\nis a place of worship."\n\n3:1:1:55\\. \'It is, however, the officiating priests that constitute the place\n(or medium) of worship: wheresoever wise and learned Brahmans, versed in\nsacred lore, perform the sacrifice, there no failure takes place: that (place\nof worship) we consider the nearest (to the gods) 1.\'\n\n3:1:1:66\\. On this (ground) they erect either a hall or a shed, with the top-\nbeams running from west to east 2; for the east is the quarter of the gods,\nand from the east westwards the gods approach men: that is why one offers to\nthem while standing with his face towards the east.\n\n3:1:1:77\\. For this reason one mug not sleep with his\n\np. 4\n\nhead towards the west, lest he should sleep stretching (his legs) towards the\ngods. The southern quarter belongs to the Fathers; and the western one to the\nsnakes; and that faultless one is the one where the gods ascended (to heaven);\nand the northern quarter belongs to men. Hence in human (practice) a hall or\nshed is constructed with the top-beams running from south to north, because\nthe north is the quarter of men. It is only for a consecrated, not for an\nunconsecrated person that it is (constructed) with the top-beams running from\nwest to east.\n\n3:1:1:88\\. They enclose it on every side, lest it should rain upon (the\nsacrificer, while being consecrated): this, at least, is (the reason for doing\nso in) the rainy season 1. He who is consecrated, truly draws nigh to the\ngods, and becomes one of the deities. Now the gods are secreted from men, and\nsecret also is what is enclosed on every side: this is why they enclose it on\nevery side.\n\n3:1:1:99\\. Not every one may enter it, but only a Brahman, or a Ra _g_ anya,\nor a Vai _s_ ya, for these are able to sacrifice.\n\n3:1:1:1010\\. Let him not commune with every one; for he who is consecrated\ndraws nigh to the gods, and becomes one of the deities. Now the gods do not\ncommune with every one, but only with a Brahman, or a. Ra _g_ anya, or a Vai\n_s_ ya; for these are able to sacrifice. Should there be occasion for him to\nconverse with a _S_ udra, let him say to one of those, \'Tell this one so and\nso! tell this one so and so!\'\n\np. 5\n\nThis is the rule of conduct for the consecrated in such a case.\n\n3:1:1:1111\\. In the first place, having taken the two churning-sticks in his\nhand, he approves of the hall. Taking hold of the chief post of the front\n(east) side, he pronounces this sacrificial formula (Va _g_. S. IV, 1), \'We\nhave come to this place of worship on earth, wherein all the gods delighted.\'\nThereby that (place of worship) of his becomes acceptable to all the gods, as\nwell as to the learned Brahmans versed in sacred lore; and that (place of\nworship) of his, which those Brahmans versed in sacred lore see with their\neyes, becomes acceptable to them.\n\n3:1:1:1212\\. And when he says, \'Wherein all the gods delighted,\' thereby it\nbecomes acceptable for him to all the gods. Crossing over by means of the _ri_\n_k_ and saman, and by the ya _g_ us;\' by means of the _ri_ _k_ and saman, and\nthe ya _g_ us, indeed, they reach the end of the sacrifice: \'May I reach the\nend of the sacrifice!\' he thereby says. \'May we rejoice in increase of\nsubstance and in sap!\' Increase of substance doubtless means abundance, and\nabundance means prosperity: he. thereby invokes a blessing. \'May we rejoice in\nsap,\' he says, because people say of one who enjoys prosperity and attains to\nthe highest distinction, that \'he rejoices in sap;\' therefore he says, \'May we\nrejoice in sap!\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1:1](sbe2603.htm#fr_23) Abhi- _s_ i, \'to lie or rise above,\' with Say. Dr.\nLindner takes bhume _h_ as abl., and translates \'whereon nothing but earth\nlies.\' The Ka _n_ va rec. has bhume _h_ (gen.) likewise in the preceding\nclause \'tad yad eva varshish _th_ am bhumes tad eva devaya _g_ ana _m_ syad\nyatranyad bhumer nabhi _s_ ayiteto vai deva, &c.\' The gods evidently ascended\nto heaven from the highest spot of the earth, and so is the sacrificer to\nchoose the highest available place. See Katy. VII, 1, 11 scholl.; La _t_ y. S.\nI, 1, 17, \'na _k_ asya sthalataram (higher place) adure syat.\'\n\n[2:1](sbe2603.htm#fr_24) Or \'subsequent;\' a play on the word \'uttara,\' which\nhas the meanings \'upper (superior), later, and left (north).\' Dr. Lindner\ntakes it in the sense of \'from the north.\' Possibly uttara also refers to the\nSoma-altars (uttara vedi and uttara-vedi) to be prepared later on (see [III,\n5, 1, 1](sbe2619.htm#3:5:1:1) seq.) on the eastern part of the sacrificial\nground.\n\n[2:2](sbe2603.htm#fr_25) The Ka _n_ va text reads,--Accordingly Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya spake, \'Varsh _n_ a intended to sacrifice (ayakshyata). Thus we went\n(ayama!) to look for a place of worship.\' He who is known as Satyaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ i\nsaid, Verily, this whole earth is divine: a place of worship there is\nwheresoever one sacrifices on it, after enclosing it with a ya _g_ us.\' And\nthus indeed he thought, but the officiating priests doubtless constitute the\n(real) place (medium) of worship: where wise (priests) perform the sacrifice\nin due form, there alone no failure takes place. That (other definition) is\nnot the characteristic of the place of worship. (Without final iti.)\n\n[3:1](sbe2603.htm#fr_26) That is to say, one who employs such skilled Brahmans\nfor his officiating priests ( _ri_ tvi _g_ ) may use sacrificial ground of any\ndescription. Katy. VII, 1, 18.\n\n[3:2](sbe2603.htm#fr_27) Pra _k_ ina-va _m_ _s_ a (prag-va _m_ _s_ a, K.). The\n\'va _m_ _s_ as\' are the horizontal beams supported by the four corner-posts.\nIn the first place two cross-beams are fastened on the corner-posts, to serve\nas the lintels of the eastern and western doors. Across them tie-beams are\nthen laid, running from west to east, on which mats are spread by way of a\nroof or ceiling. The tern \'pra _k_ ina-va _m_ _s_ a\' refers to these upper\nbeams (upari-va _m_ _s_ a), and especially to the central beam (p _ri_ sh _th_\na-va _m_ _s_ a or madhyavala) the ends of which rest on the middle of the\nlintels of the eastern and western doors; cf. Saya _n_ a on Taitt. S. I, 2, 1\n(vol. i, pp. 279, 286); Katy. VII, I, 20 scholl. Inside the Pra _k_ ina-va _m_\n_s_ a there is the \xc3\x82havaniya fire immediately facing the east door; the\nGarhapatya fire facing the west door; between the two the altar; and south of\nthe latter the Dakshi _n_ agni. The shed (vimita) is to be erected on the back\n(west) part of the sacrificial ground, after the roots have been dug up. It is\ndescribed as a square structure of ten (or twelve) cubits, somewhat higher in\nfront than at the back; with doors on each side (except, optionally, on the\nnorth). The _s_ ala, or hall, is to measure twenty cubits by ten. Katy. VII,\n1, 19-24 comm.\n\n[4:1](sbe2603.htm#fr_28) (?) Iti nv eva varsha _h_. The same particles occur\n[III, 2, 1, 11](sbe2607.htm#3:2:1:11). The Ka _n_ va text has,--\'lest it\nshould freeze in winter, lest it should pour in the rainy season, and lest\nthere should be burning heat in summer.\'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 1, 2.
