The king spoke :-- O Lord! Kindly describe the rules and regulations as to\nhow the Devi Yaj\xc3\xb1a (sacrifice) is performed with its duly prescribed rites and\nceremonies. Hearing it I will unwearied perform it, as far as it lies in my\npower, with as little delay as possible.\n\n\n\n2\\. How the worship is done, what are the mantras, what are the articles\nrequired for oblations, how many Brahmi _n_ s are required and what Dak _s_\ninas are to be paid to them, describe in detail all these.\n\n\n\n3-5. Vyasa said :-- O king! I am telling you duly how the Yaj\xc3\xb1a is performed,\nhear. The actions are always threefold according as the preparations are made\nand according as they are practised with regard to the observed rules. The\nthreefold divisions are Sattvik, Rajasik and Tamasic. The Munis do the Sattvik\nPuja, the kings celebrate Rajasic and the Rakshasas do the Tamasik Pujas.\nThere is another Puja which is devoid of qualities and which is performed by\nthe liberated ones. I will describe to you all these in detail.\n\n\n\n6-7. O king! The Yaj\xc3\xb1a is then called Sattvik, when it is performed in a\nSattvik country, like Benares, etc., in Sattvik time, e.g., in Uttaraya _n_ a,\nwhen the materials collected are earned rightly, when the mantras are those of\nthe Vedas, when the Brahmi _n_ is Srotriya, where there is Sattvik faith, void\nof any attachment towards the sensual objects, when all these happen to\ncoincide. O king! When all the above takes place and there is purification of\nmaterials, actions, and mantras, i.e., when the\n\n\n\np. 164\n\n\n\nmaterials are all right, when the actions are done as they ought to be, and\nwhere there is no error or omission, etc., in the mantras, etc., then and then\nonly the Yaj\xc3\xb1a becomes perfect and no doubt yield full results; there would be\nnothing contrary to this.\n\n\n\n8-9. If the Yaj\xc3\xb1a is performed with articles not rightly earned, then there is\nno fame either in this world nor there is any reward in the next world.\nTherefore it is necessary that the Yaj\xc3\xb1a should be performed with rightly\nearned materials; then there is fame in this world and better state in the\nnext world; and happiness is also acquired; there is no doubt in this.\n\n\n\n10\\. O king! It is before your eyes, as it were, that the Pan _d_ avas\nperformed the Rajasuya Yaj\xc3\xb1a, the king of sacrifices, and, on the completion\nwhereof, the excellent Dak _s_ inas were paid to the Brahmi _n_ s and others.\n\n\n\n11\\. In that Yaj\xc3\xb1a the highly intelligent S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a Himself, the Lord of\nthe Yadavas was present, as well as many other Brahma _n_ as, like Bharadvaja\nand other fully enightened souls.\n\n\n\n12\\. But within three months after completing the sacrifice, the Pan _d_ avas\nsuffered extreme hardships and had to live, with extreme difficulty, as exiles\nin the forest.\n\n\n\n13\\. Consider the insult shown towards Draupadi, the Pan _d_ ava's defeat in\nthe play of gambling, their going away to dwell in the forest; these hardships\nwere borne by the Pan _d_ avas. What rewards did then the Pan _d_ avas derive\nfrom the Rajasuya Yaj\xc3\xb1a?\n\n\n\n14-15. All the high-souled Pan _d_ avas had to work as slaves of Virata; and\nDraupadi, the best of women, was very much troubled and insulted by Kichaka.\nWhen all these occurred, any one can easily ask where were the ashirvadas of\nthe pure souled Brahma _n_ as? Also what result did they derive from their\nunflinching devotion towards S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a when they were involved in the\nabove critical state?\n\n\n\n16\\. No one protected Draupadi, the chaste and the best, the daughter of\nDrupada, when she was drawn by her hair on her head into the hall of assembly\nwhere gambling was being played?\n\n\n\n17\\. O king! How could all these happen in a place where S\xc2\x92ri Bhagavan Kesava\nHimself and the high souled Yudhis _th_ ira were present? If one argues, one\nwould conclude \xc2\x93there must have been something wrong in that Yaj\xc3\xb1a.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n18\\. If you say that nothing wrong happened in the Yaj\xc3\xb1a, all these were\ncaused by Fate; then it comes to this :-- that the Vedic mantras, \xc3\x82gamas and\nthe other Vedic rites are all fruitless.\n\n\n\np. 165\n\n\n\n19\\. If it be argued that though the Vedic mantras are powerful enough to bear\nfruits, yet whatever is predestined to come to pass, will surely pass, then\nthe proposition resolves into this :-- that all the means, expedients, and\nappliances lead to meaningless conclusions.\n\n\n\n20\\. Then the \xc3\x82gamas, the Vedas merely recommend a vidhi or precept by stating\nthe good arising from its proper observance and the evils arising from its\nomission and also by adducing historical instances as its support; in other\nwords, they are powerless as far as bearing fruits is concerned; all the acts\nare meaningless, asceticism to attain Heaven comes as useless and the peculiar\nduties of caste are fruitless. O king! This view is exceedingly culpable; it\nis never fit for acceptance by the highsouled persons.\n\n\n\n21\\. O King! If what is laid by God in the womb of futurity (a state of things\npreordained by God in which it is sure to take place in the fullness of time),\nbe taken as the first-hand proof, then all the other proofs are rendered null\nand void. Therefore Fate and human exertion both are to be undoubtedly taken\ninto account to ensure success.\n\n\n\n22\\. Human exertions being applied, if the results come otherwise, the wise\nPundits would infer that some defects, omissions or imperfections crept into\nthe work.\n\n\n\n23\\. All the Pundits, very learned and instituters of sacrifices have classed\nKarmas under different headings according as the agents, mantras, and articles\nemployed in the worship vary.\n\n\n\n24\\. Once on an occasion Vis\xc2\x92varupa, ordained as a Guru by Indra (in a Yaj\xc3\xb1a)\n(intentionally) did things contrary so as to benefit the Daityas, who belonged\nto his mother's side.\n\n\n\n25\\. Vis\xc2\x92varupa uttered repeatedly the mantrams beneficial to the gods, while\nthey were present; and, during their absence, prayed heartily for the welfare\nof the Daityas; and, in the long run, protected the Daityas.\n\n\n\n26\\. On seeing the Asuras gaining strength, Indra, the Lord of the Devas,\nbecame very much enraged and instantly cut off Vis\xc2\x92varupa's head by his\nthunderbolt.\n\n\n\n27\\. O King! This is then the instance where the contrary fruits were borne\nout by the agent employed in performing the Yaj\xc3\xb1a; there is no doubt in this.\nThis is not possible in the other cases.\n\n\n\n28\\. See, again, the king of Panchala performed his sacrifice to get a son to\nkill Dro _n_ a, the son of Bharadvaja; and though he did this out of angry\nmotives, still Dhri _st_ adyumna was born out of fire; and Draupadi sprang out\nof the altar.\n\n\n\np. 166\n\n\n\n29\\. Again, in days of yore, Das\xc2\x92aratha, the king of Kosala, was sonless; and\nhe instituted a sacrifice to get one son; and lo! be got four sons.\n\n\n\n30\\. Therefore O King! If the Yaj\xc3\xb1a be performed according to proper rules and\nregulations, it yields fruits in all respects; again if it be done\nunrighteously, without any regard for the rules, etc., it yields results just\nthe contrary; there is no doubt in this.\n\n\n\n31-32. Therefore, there must have been some defects in the Yaj\xc3\xb1a of the Pan\n_d_ avas; hence contrary effects ensued, and therefore the truthful king\nYudhis _t_ hira and his powerful brothers and the chaste Draupadi were all\ndefeated in the play at dice.\n\n\n\n33\\. It might be that the materials were not of a good stamp; they were all\nearned by killing the kings, good many in number, and earned thus\nunrighteously; or it might happen that the Pan _d_ avas did their Yaj\xc3\xb1a with\ntoo much egoism. However, this is certain that there had crept in some defects\nin their actions.\n\n\n\n34\\. O King! The Sattvik Yaj\xc3\xb1a is rare; it can be done only by the Sattvik\nMunis who live in the 3rd order of the household life or who live as hermits.\n\n\n\n35-36. The ascetics that eat daily the Sattvik food, the roots and fruits,\ncollected from forests and obtained rightly, that is good to the Munis and\nthat is well cleaned and purified, are the only ones that can perform with\nfull devotions the Sattvik Yaj\xc3\xb1as, where no animals are sacrificed (where\nthere are no sacrificial posts to which the victim is fastened at the time of\nimmolation) and where offerings of cakes of ground rice in vessels are given.\nThese are the best of all the Sattvik Yaj\xc3\xb1as.\n\n\n\n37\\. The K _s_ attriyas and the Vai _s_ yas perform the Yaj\xc3\xb1as with Abhiman\n(self-conceit and egoism) where many presents are given, animals are\nsacrificed, and all things are well cleansed, purified and elaborately\ndecorated. This Yaj\xc3\xb1a is called Rajasic.\n\n\n\n38\\. That Yaj\xc3\xb1a is according to the sages, Tamasik, where the Danavas, puffed\nup with arrogance, infatuated with anger, jealousy and wickedness perform\ntheir acts with the sole object of killing their enemies.\n\n\n\n39\\. That Yaj\xc3\xb1a is called Manas Yag or manasic (mental) where the high-souled\nMunis, void of worldly desires, collect mentally all the necessary articles\nand perform the Yaj\xc3\xb1a with the sole object of liberation from the bondages of\nthe world.\n\n\n\n40\\. In all the other Yaj\xc3\xb1as (than the Manas Yag) some imperfections or other\nnaturally arise, due to some defects in the materials, or want of faith, or in\nthe performance or in the Brahmi _n_ s.\n\n\n\np. 167\n\n\n\n41\\. No other Yaj\xc3\xb1as can be so complete as the Manasa Yaj\xc3\xb1a; the reason being\nthat in the other Yaj\xc3\xb1as some, imperfections come out due to time, place, and\nseparate ingredients to be collected.\n\n\n\n42-43. Now hear who are the persons fit to undertake this mental Yaj\xc3\xb1a in\nhonour of the Great Goddess. First this mind is to be purified, by making it\nvoid of the Gu _n_ as; the mind being pure, the body becomes also pure, there\nis no doubt. When the mind becomes completely pure, after it has abandoned all\nsensual objects, fit for enjoyment, then that man is entitled to perform the\nMother's Yaj\xc3\xb1a.\n\n\n\n44-45. There he should build mentally the big hall for sacrifice, many Yojanas\nwide, decorated with high polished pillars out of the materials brought for\nthe purpose (e. g., fortitude, etc.). Within the hall he will imagine a wide\nand spacious altar and place the Holy Fire on it mentally according to due\nrules and regulations.\n\n\n\n46-47. He is to select mentally the Brahmi _n_ priests and consecrate them as\nBrahma, Adharyu, Hota, Prastota, Udgata, Pratihatra and other assistants. He\nis to worship mentally all these priests.\n\n\n\n48\\. Then he will have to imagine the five Vayus, Pra _n_ a, Apana, Vyana,\nSamana, and Udana, as the five fires and locate them duly on the altar.\n\n\n\n49-50. Pra _n_ a Vayu stands for Garhapatya; Apana, for \xc3\x82havaniya; Vyana for\nDak _s_ ina; Samana for Avasathya; and Udana for Sabhya Agni. These fires are\nall very terrible; then one should place these carefully on the altar with\ngreat concentration of mind. He is to collect then all the other necessary\nmaterials and think that all are very pure and free from any defects.\n\n\n\n51-57. In the Manasic Yaj\xc3\xb1a, mind is the offerer of oblations and mind the\nYajamana, the performer of the Sacrifice; and the Presiding Deity of the\nSacrifice is the Nirgu _n_ a Brahma. The Great Goddess, the Nirgu _n_ a\nEnergy, who is always auspicious and gives the feeling of dispassion and\nindifference to worldly objects is the awarder of fruits in this Yaj\xc3\xb1a. She is\nthe Brahma Vidya, She is the substratum of all and She is all pervading. The\nBrahmi _n_ is to take the Devi's name and offer oblations in the fire of Pra\n_n_ a, the necessary articles for the Devi's satisfaction. Then he is to make\nhis Chitta and Pra _n_ a void of any worldly thought, or any worldly support\nand to offer oblations to the Eternal Brahma through the mouth of Kun _d_\nalini (the Serpent Fire.) Next, within his Nirvikalpa mind, by means of\nSamadhi, be should meditate own Self, the Mahes'vari Herself by his\nconsciousness. Thus, when he will see his own self in all the beings and all\nthe beings in his own self, then\n\n\n\np. 168\n\n\n\nthe Jiva will get the vision of the Goddess Mahavidya, giving auspicious\nliberation (Mok _s_ a). O King! After the high souled Munis have seen the\nGoddess, of everlasting intelligence and bliss, then he becomes the knower of\nBrahma _n_. All the Maya, the cause of this Universe becomes burnt up; only,\nas long as the body remains, the Prarabdha Karma remains.\n\n\n\n58\\. Then the Jivas become liberated, while living; and when the body\ndissolves, he attains to final liberation. Therefore, O Child! Whoever\nworships the Mother becomes crowned with success; there is no doubt in this.\n\n\n\n59\\. Therefore follow the advice of the Guru, the Spiritual Teacher; and with\nall attention, hear, think and meditate on the Great Goddess of the World.\n\n\n\n60\\. O King! Liberation is sure to ensue of this Manasa Yaj\xc3\xb1a. All the other\nYaj\xc3\xb1as are Sakama (with some object in view) and therefore their effects are\ntemporary.\n\n\n\n61-62. He who wants enjoyments in Heaven, should perform the Agni _st_ oma\nYaj\xc3\xb1a, with due rites and ceremonies; such is the Vedic injunction. But when\nthe acquired merit expires, the sacrificer will have to come again into this\nworld of mortals. Therefore the Manasa Yaj\xc3\xb1a is eternal and best.\n\n\n\n63-65. This Manasa Yaj\xc3\xb1a is not fit to be performed by kings intent on getting\nvictory. The Yaj\xc3\xb1a that you performed, the serpent Yaj\xc3\xb1a, is Tamasic, for you\nwanted to take vengeance on your enemy, the serpent Tak _s_ aka; and millions\nof serpents were made to be burnt in that sacrifice.\n\n\n\nO King! Hear now about the Devi Yaj\xc3\xb1a, that was performed by Vi _sn_ u in the\nbeginning of the creation. You better now do that Devi Yaj\xc3\xb1a with due rules.\n\n\n\n66-67. I will tell you all about the rules; there are Brahmi _n_ s that know\nthe rules and know best also the Vedas; they know also the seed mantrams of\nthe Devi, as well as the rules of their application; they are clever in all\nthe mantrams. These will be your priests and you yourself will be the\nsacrificer.\n\n\n\n68\\. O King! Do this sacrifice duly and deliver your father from hell by the\nmerits that you will acquire thereby.\n\n\n\n69\\. O Sinless One! The sin incurred on account of insulting a Brahmi _n_ is\nserious and leads the sinner to hell. Your father committed that sin and\nincurred the curse from a Brahmi _n_. Therefore he has gone to the hell.\n\n\n\np. 169\n\n\n\n70\\. Your father died also out of a snake bite which is not a meritorious one.\nThe death occurred also in a palace built high up in the air (on a pillar),\ninstead of taking place on the ground on a bed of Kus'a grass.\n\n\n\n71\\. O best of the Kurus! The death did not occur in any battle nor on the\nbanks of the Ganges. Void of proper bathing and charities, etc., he died in a\npalace.\n\n\n\n72\\. O best of Kings! All the ugly causes, leading to hell, were present in\nthe case of your father. See, again, there is also one thing which done will\nlead to one\xc2\x92s liberation; but that was absent too with your father.\n\n\n\n73-76. That is this :-- Let a man remain, wherever he may, whenever he comes\nto learn that his end is approaching, even if he had not practised before any\ngood practices or meritorious deeds, and even if he becomes senseless in the\ntrial time of death, when dispassion comes to an individual whose mind gets,\nfor the time being, clear and free from any worldly thoughts, then he should\nthink thus :-- \xc2\x93This my body, composed of five elements, will soon be\ndestroyed; there is no cause whatsoever in having any remorse for it; let\nwhatever come, that it may; I am free, void of qualities; and I am the Eternal\nPuru _s_ a; death is not capable to do any harm to me. All the elements are\nliable to decay and destruction; what remorse can overtake me? I am not a man\nof the world, I am always free, Eternal Brahma; I have got no connection with\nthis body that is merely the outcome of actions.\n\n\n\n77\\. Before I did meritorious or unmeritorious acts, leading to happiness and\npain; therefore I have got this mortal coil and am enjoying the fruits of my\npast auspicious or inauspicious Karma.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n78\\. Whoever thinks thus and dies, even if he does not take proper\npurificatory bath or make any charity, he gets himself freed from the awful\nSamsara and never comes to see himself again born in this world.\n\n\n\n79\\. O King! This method of parting from one\xc2\x92s body is rarely attained even by\nthe Yogins; this is the acme, the highest height of all the human efforts\ntowards liberation.\n\n\n\n80\\. But your father, hearing even the curse from a Brahmi _n_ , retained his\nattachment towards his body; therefore he did not attain dispassion.\n\n\n\n81\\. He thought thus :-- \xc2\x93My body is now free from any disease; my kingdom is\nfree from enemies or any other source of danger; how can I now get myself\nsaved from this untimely death.\xc2\x94 Thinking thus, he ordered to call the Brahma\n_n_ s, who know the mantrams.\n\n\n\np. 170\n\n\n\n82\\. Then that king ascended to the palace, with medicines, many mantras and\nmany other instruments.\n\n\n\n83-84. He considered his fate to be the strongest and therefore did not take\nhis bath in any holy place; he did not perform any charities, did not sleep on\nthe ground or remember any mantram of the Devi. Due to Kali entering into his\nbody, he committed the sin of insulting an ascetic and plunged himself in the\nocean of delusion and died bitten by the Tak _s_ aka snake on the top of a\npalace.\n\n\n\n85\\. The King has now fallen undoubtedly to the hell, on account of those\nvicious deeds. Therefore, O King! dost Thou deliver your father from the sin.\n\n\n\n86\\. Suta said, O Ri _s_ is! Hearing these words from the fiery Vyasa, the\nking Janamejaya became very sad and tears came from his eyes and flowed down\nhis cheeks and throat.\n\n\n\nHe then exclaimed in a suffocating voice \xc2\x93Fie on me! my father is still in the\nhell. I will now do at once whatever leads my father to heaven.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nThus ends the twelfth chapter on the Amba Yaj\xc3\xb1a rules in the 3rd Adhyaya of\nS\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, the Maha Pura _n_ am of 18,000 verses composed by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 13](bk03ch13.htm)\n\n"
