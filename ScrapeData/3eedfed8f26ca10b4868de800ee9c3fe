It was the doctor\'s voice in the doorway, and\nI knew at once what he meant. My first case of plague. A few minutes later we\nentered the cottage where the patient lay. It was an ordinary mud hut, with\nits tiny unlighted compartments opening on a central court. In one room lay a\nquantity of clean linen, for the people were _dhobies_ ; in another division\nwas the family cow; and at the moment of our entrance the matter in hand was\nthe lifting of the invalid out of a confined room to a small wooden bed on the\nveranda. Utterly lethargic he lay there, poor child, a bright promising boy of\ntwelve or fourteen. He had been ill since the previous evening; it was now\nnine o\'clock in the morning; the bubo was slightly developed; and with the\ngravest predictions and repeated instructions the doctor hurried off to attend\njust such another.\n\nIt was so little that could be done. Food, medicine, and a bath--all these\ncould be given. Yes, and the head could be shaved, ice applied,\n\np. 71\n\nand a fan kept going; but when all was said and done, one was sitting there to\nwatch a human being die--to watch, without hope of saving. For no one who knew\nthe awful intensity of the struggle into which he would presently have to\nenter, who knew too the overgrown and underfed condition of the child himself,\ncould have a doubt as to the way the battle would end. The evening would come,\nand he would die. So the doctor had said. Not that I realised this. If I had,\nI doubt whether I could have driven the mother off at once, as, to my bitter\nregret, I did, possessed by the notion that isolation and disinfection, the\nonly services I could render, should be thoroughly performed. She was busy\nnear her boy, fanning him perhaps, and constantly inhaling the air that he was\nbreathing out. Did I know she was his mother? I should like to think not. I\nshould like to make any excuse for the fact that I pointed out to her that it\nwould be wise if she sat some distance away. Poor mother! She went at once,\ncrushed and broken-spirited, without a word. But quietly, quietly the tears\nbegan to flow down her poor thin face, and she broke into stifled sobs. That\nwas too much. I found something that she must do, and with careful advice\nbrought her back to do it. And there she sat, thenceforward, curled up beside\nthe pillow with the boy\'s head at her feet.\n\np. 72\n\nHe was violent now, and the great effort was to keep him quiet, for one\nunlucky movement might be fatal. But even in his delirium I had this always\nbefore me--the sight of perfect love between a mother and her son. Once,\nindeed, mistaking me for her, he snatched at my hand, and carried his own to\nhis lips, and often, not catching his mother\'s eyes, he would smile at me--\nalways with that same debonair and tender look of the good comrade, given to\ncarrying the burdens and bringing his mother cheer. I was reminded of that\nmoment earlier in the morning, when he had caught the announcement that no\nbarber could be got for him under two or three pice, and struggling to rise\nfrom his bed had cried that he would bring him for one.\n\nHe was evidently a good boy, in more senses than one--a devotee and a dreamer\nof dreams. For every now and then, as a gleam of consciousness would displace\nthe awful look of alienation in the great brown eyes--every now and then he\nwould call loudly upon _Shiva, Kali!_ or repeat words of worship; and nothing\nsoothed and quieted him like the incessant repetition of _Haribol_ , or the\nhymn that was commonly sung about the streets at that time:\n\n"Call on the Lord,  \nCall on the Lord,  \nCall on the Lord, my brother, p. 73  \nThan this name of the Lord,  \nFor mortal man,  \nThere is no other way."\n\n"There is no other way," the weak voice would murmur in snatches after me, and\nthen the invisible hand would again, as it were, draw the curtain, and the\nsoul would be seen no more at the windows whence for a moment it had looked\nforth.\n\nAnd so the end came. All day long the family had watched in the courtyard, his\nmother and myself on the little veranda. All day long they had been eager to\nserve in every way that was possible, and when I had to go away for an hour or\ntwo my place was taken by a young man from the neighbourhood, whose quiet\ndignity and firmness in dealing with the patient roused my hearty admiration.\nAt five in the afternoon the doctor returned. "He is getting very low," he\nsaid; "another hour or two at most and the outburst will end in a collapse of\nthe heart."\n\nHow long the minutes seemed! For the last outbreak of violence was very short-\nlived, and ended in a wild attempt to repeat the _Haribol_ for a length of\ntime. I took up the words, and stood saying them over and over to the\nmovements of the fan, while with a look of relief the lad\'s head sank back on\nthe pillow. He lay quiet, the breath came in shorter and shorter gasps, and he\ndied.\n\np. 74\n\n"Give me twelve instead of one," said the doctor, "and I can try steam baths."\n\nIt was evident that one could hope to do nothing alone. All the medical men\nheld that a man once down with plague was doomed. It was a great thing to know\nthat there was a field for work; that the disease, though so deadly, was\nneither repulsive nor specially infectious; that assistance was wanted in\norder to try finer methods of treatment; and above all, that, as I had ample\nopportunity of verifying later, no prejudice of caste or religion would stand\nin the way of our help being accepted. But in order to act upon all this\nknowledge, religious orders like those Franciscans of the Middle Ages who put\nan end to the same disease in Europe would be required, so for the moment we\ngave up the idea.\n\nThen persons with influence were consulted, and offers of help came from\nzenana ladies, if we should turn a house of our own into a women\'s hospital.\nAt this point our difficulties began to be amusing. The nurses were to be\nzenana ladies, and so were the patients. This sounded simple enough. But the\nlatter would insist on being accompanied to the hospital by their husbands,\nbrothers, or sons, who would watch by their bedside day and night. And in that\ncase, how could the nurses attend to them?\n\n"Besides," said the kindly official who was advising\n\np. 75\n\nus, "to turn your house into a hospital would involve some little expense, and\ndo you know what would be your chance of receiving patients, after all?"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n"There are more than six hundred hospitals in Calcutta," 1 he said, "and they\ncontain an aggregate of something like four patients."\n\nSo our dream of a hospital for Bengali women, managed by Bengali ladies, also\ncame to an end, and we also realised the wisdom of the Government in deciding\nthat its duty lay not in grappling with the disease itself, but rather with\nthe conditions that had led to its development.\n\nThe conditions which are immediately preventible appear to be twofold: (1)\ninsanitation, and (2) ignorance; and if solid work is done towards the removal\nof these evils, it cannot but be that the plague shall prove a friend to\nmankind in the long run.\n\nOne of its first and greatest services leas lain in the humanising of the\nlower castes. Their labour is at this moment in high demand. Bright little\nsweeper-boys command the wages of full-grown men, with short hours and plenty\nof encouragement\n\np. 76\n\nand stimulus to work. How proud of themselves the conservancy gangs look,\nspades in their hands and buckets on their shoulders! Strange how all things\nwork in together to further the great purpose of an epoch, and even a\ncatastrophe like the present is really to hasten that supreme function of the\nEnglish in India, the giving of democracy to the Indian people. For the\nimmediate outcome of good work and good wages is sure to be the establishment\nof schools in sweeper-villages, and with that first step taken towards the\nmountain-peaks of knowledge it is not too early to look forward to the day\nwhen they shall be received as men in the councils of their nation.\n\nOne thing that has struck me daily, as I have gone about the _bustees_ to note\nprogress and conditions, is the fine physique of these "untouchables,"\ncompared with higher-caste boys of their own age. Though small-built, they are\nlithe, active, and well-knit. One never sees among them those physical\ndeformities of bad feeding and ill-health that are so common among the\nchildren of the very poor.\n\nBut, except for this superiority, I must confess that I find no marked\ndifference of type. They seem to me to have, like other Hindus, the same faces\nthat I have been accustomed to all my life, under slightly darker skins. If I\nhad not known the country, I should have believed that this so-called\n\np. 77\n\n[paragraph continues] Negritoid Pariah was as good an Aryan as myself; that he\nwas no aboriginal, set to the hewing of wood and drawing of water for the\nrace\'s sake, but one who had simply lost rank by that same process of trade-\ndifferentiation that certainly accounts for so many of the castes. These men\nare very dark, it is true--quite a chocolate-brown in some cases; but they are\nby no means uniformly so, and I have seen this particular colour sometimes in\nthe highest classes, especially, as I fancy, where there is much exposure to\nthe weather. Perhaps, however, there is greater irregularity of features\namongst these pariahs than higher up in the social scale; but the question\nremains, whether this is due to race-inferiority, or to that freedom for\nindividuality which must result from laxity of conventions. No one who has\nseen how the children of converted Jews lose the physiognomy of their\nforefathers will despise the influence of ideas on national types.\n\nAnyway, whatever may be the future of our boys, for the present they are full\nof fun and enthusiasm. A really bad drain is quite a find to them all, and\nthey work with patience and ardour, under supervision. For the real\ninferiority of the lower castes is that they require so much organisation and\nsuperintendence from their more fortunate countrymen. In the case of the one\ngang in which I am interested, three different people devote time\n\np. 78\n\nand attention to overlooking the labour, and under these, again, there is the\nforeman of the gang; and every bit of this is absolutely necessary.\n\nOne of the most intolerable evils is the arrangement of bamboo "sanitary\nstructures" in large clusters in the very centre and in close contact with\ndwelling-huts. These and the tanks--which continually receive sewage and other\ncontaminations from the _bustees_ \\--constitute the great permanent nuisances\nof the town. Nothing short of complete effacement could be efficient\nsanitation; but it should be added that the present state of things is of very\nlong standing, and not an outgrowth of recent years.\n\nIn the pursuit of difficulties there is, I find, a limit at which toil becomes\nmore or less sullen and despairing. Such toil for a scavenger can be found in\none of the outlying districts of the Calcutta municipal area, where our\nworkers discovered drains which would bid a fair defiance to Herakles himself.\nAnd there dwelt a Mussulman population, consisting of poultry, goats, and\nhuman beings iii inextricable confusion.\n\nThere are open spaces with green grass in these villages, and visions of how\nit might be tantalise one as one explores--a well-flushed and repaired ditch;\na pleasant village-green; a tree or a flowering shrub here and there. Given\nthe land, these things ought not to be impossible for\n\np. 79\n\ntwo thousand people paying municipal rates in one of the richest cities of the\nworld. But we have had to keep twenty men digging for a week to get even a\ntiny stream of water to trickle feebly out of that terrible ditch. It had not\nbeen touched, they say, for fifteen years. And though we have swept the\nvillage-green, we have had no means for turning it into a garden, nor would we\nif we could, since we could not thereafter provide the wherewithal to keep it\nsweet and beautiful.\n\nIn the heart of this sordid quarter we come upon a little Moslem burying-\nground. A low wall, pierced with a simple pattern, bounds it in restful\ncurving lines. It is entirely without monuments or memorials, but in one\ncorner a blasted tree of some sort--not unlike those grudging-leaved elders of\nthe English Black Country--seems to stand for a landmark. And here, as they\ntell us, a holy man lies buried, and they, too poor to erect a stone, and too\nfaithful to forget, have made shift with this old stump to keep green the\nmemory of one who, poor like themselves, helped them years ago to live a\nfuller life.\n\nA curious thing about a neighbourhood like this is that now and then one finds\nin it some old house and garden of great respectability. Is it a law of the\ngrowth of population that the\n\np. 80\n\npoor inhabit always what the rich have left? How else can one explain the\ntraces of past grandeur that one meets everywhere? In another _bustee_ ,\nsurely one of the most hopeless of its sort, we find on the great central tank\na ruined _ghat_ that was once superb. The whole thing, with the reflection of\nthe water in the sky, and the old tree that to this day bears its yearly load\nof glorious flame-coloured blossoms, is uncommonly like the picturesque and\nruined villages of Kashmir.\n\nOne has to go down under the surface to see that the plague is here at all.\nWhen we hear in Europe that a place is "declared" stricken, we conjure up\npictures of mortality in all its forms: grass growing on deserted pavements,\nhouses marked with crosses, and the weird voice at midnight crying "Bring out\nyour dead!" How different it really is! I first heard of the ravages of the\ndisease at a European dinner party, and I came home and discovered that seven\ndeaths had occurred in one week in my own lane.\n\nNot a sound had betrayed the fact. The accustomed wailing had all been hushed.\nThe dead had been buried or burned at night. Not one word to the outside world\nhad betrayed the agony of the watchers by the beloved. Not one token told that\nmen had dropped out of the ranks of the living. This was, of course, at the\n\np. 81\n\nbeginning of the outbreak. As time went on, the people realised, I think, that\nno outrage on their privacy was intended, and one began to meet the bearers\nmore often about the streets, chanting _Rama Nama Satya hai_ (The Name of the\nLord alone is real) to their swinging pace, as they carried silent forms to\nthe last rites; or one encountered one of those mournful Moslem processions by\ntorchlight to the sound of the solemn _Allah illa, \'ill, \'ill Allah!_ in the\nhour of dusk.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[75:1](seh15.htm#fr_2) Six hundred hospitals was a computation that included\nall family hospitals and single rooms licensed and set apart as wards under\nthe Plague Regulations. Even of these many were allowed to lapse, so that the\nactual number came to be much below six hundred while still unnecessarily\nlarge.
