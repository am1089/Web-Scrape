It is loved by pious people\nlike the soil of Mount Kailasa. The river of heaven shines there like a pearl\nnecklace. And in the city lived a king called Valour who burned up all his\nenemies by his valour, as a fire burns a forest. He had a son named\nThunderbolt who broke the pride of the love-god by his beauty, and the pride\nof men by his bravery. This prince had a clever friend, the son of a\ncounsellor.\n\nOne day the prince was enjoying himself with his friend hunting, and went a\nlong distance. And so he came to a great forest. There he saw a beautiful\nlake, and being tired, he drank from it with his friend the counsellor\'s son,\nwashed his hands and feet, and sat down under a tree on the bank.\n\nAnd then he saw a beautiful maiden who had come there with her servants to\nbathe. She seemed to fill the lake with the stream of her beauty, and seemed\nto make lilies grow there with her eyes, and seemed to shame the lotuses with\na face more lovely than the moon. She captured the prince\'s heart the moment\nthat he saw her. And the prince took her eyes captive.\n\nThe girl had a strange feeling when she saw him, but was too modest to say a\nword. So she gave a hint of the feeling in her heart. She put a lotus on her\near, laid a lily on her head after she had made the edge look like a row of\nteeth, and placed her hand on her heart. But the prince did not understand her\nsigns, only the clever counsellor\'s son understood them all.\n\nA moment later the girl went away, led by her servants. She went home and sat\non the sofa and stayed there. But her thoughts were with the prince.\n\nThe prince went slowly back to his city, and was terribly lonely without her,\nand grew thinner every day. Then his friend the son of  the counsellor took\nhim aside and told him that she was not hard to find. But he had lost all\ncourage and said: "My friend, I don\'t know her name, nor her home, nor her\nfamily. How can I find her? Why do you vainly try to comfort me?"\n\nThen the counsellor\'s son said: "Did you not see all that she hinted with her\nsigns? When she put the lotus on her ear, she meant that she lived in the\nkingdom of a king named Ear-lotus. And when she made the row of teeth, she\nmeant that she was the daughter of a man named Bite there. And when she laid\nthe lily on her head, she meant that her name was Lily. And when she placed\nher hand on her heart, she meant that she loved you. And there is a king named\nEar-lotus in the Kalinga country. There is a very rich man there whom the king\nlikes. His real name is Battler, but they call him Bite. He has a pearl of a\ngirl whom he loves more than his life, and her name is Lily. This is true,\nbecause people told me. So I understood her signs about her country and the\nother things." When the counsellor\'s son had said this, the prince was\ndelighted to find him so clever, and pleased because he knew what to do.\n\nThen he formed a plan with the counsellor\'s son, and started for the lake\nagain, pretending that he was going to hunt, but really to find the girl that\nhe loved. On the way he rode like the wind away from his soldiers, and started\nfor the Kalinga country with the counsellor\'s son.\n\nWhen they reached the city of King Ear-lotus, they looked about and found the\nhouse of the man called Bite, and they went to a house near by to live with an\nold woman. And the counsellor\'s son said to the old woman: "Old woman, do you\nknow anybody named Bite in this city?"\n\nThen the old woman answered him respectfully: "My son, I know him well. I was\nhis nurse. And I am a servant of his daughter Lily. But I do not go there now\nbecause my dress is stolen. My naughty son is a gambler and steals my\nclothes."\n\nThen the counsellor\'s son was pleased and satisfied her with his own cloak and\nother presents. And he said: "Mother, you must do very secretly what we tell\nyou. Go to Bite\'s daughter Lily, and tell her that the prince whom she saw on\nthe bank of the lake is here, and sent you with a love-message to her."\n\nThe old woman was pleased with the gifts and went to Lily at once. And when\nshe got a chance, she said: "My child, the prince and the counsellor\'s son\nhave come to take you. Tell me what to do now." But the girl scolded her and\nstruck her cheeks with both hands smeared with camphor.\n\nThe old woman was hurt by this treatment, and came home weeping, and said to\nthe two men: "My sons, see how she left the marks of her fingers on my face."\n\nAnd the prince was hopeless and sad, but the very clever counsellor\'s son took\nhim aside and said, "My friend, do not be sad. She was only keeping the secret\nwhen she scolded the old woman, and put ten fingers white with camphor on her\nface. She meant that you must wait before seeing her, for the next ten nights\nare bright with moonlight."\n\nSo the counsellor\'s son comforted the prince, took a little gold ornament and\nsold it in the market, and bought a great dinner for the old woman. So they\ntwo took dinner with the old woman. They did this for ten days, and then the\ncounsellor\'s son sent her to Lily again, to find out something more.\n\nAnd the old woman was eager for dainty food and drink. So to please him she\nwent to Lily\'s house, and then came back and said: "My children, I went there\nand stayed with her for some time without speaking. But she spoke herself of\nmy naughtiness in mentioning you, and struck me again on the chest with three\nfingers stained red. So I came back in disgrace."\n\nThen the counsellor\'s son whispered to the prince: "Don\'t be alarmed, my\nfriend. When she left the marks of three red fingers on the old woman\'s heart,\nshe meant to say very cleverly that there were three dangerous days coming."\nSo the counsellor\'s son comforted the prince.\n\nAnd when three days were gone, he sent the old woman to Lily again. And this\ntime she went and was very respectfully entertained, and treated to wine and\nother things the whole day. But when she was ready to go back in the evening,\na terrible shouting was heard outside. They heard people running and crying:\n"Oh, oh! A mad elephant has escaped from his stable and is running around and\nstamping on people."\n\nThen Lily said to the old woman: "Mother, you must not go through the street\nnow where the elephant is. I will put you in a swing and let you down with\nropes through this great window into the garden. Then you can climb into a\ntree and jump on the wall, and go home by way of another tree." So she had her\nservants let the old woman down from the window into the garden by a rope-\nswing. And the old woman went home and told the prince and the counsellor\'s\nson all about it.\n\nThen the counsellor\'s son said to the prince: "My friend, your wishes are\nfulfilled. She has been clever enough to show you the road. So you must follow\nthat same road this very evening to the room of your darling."\n\nSo the prince went to the garden with the counsellor\'s son by the road that\nthe old woman had shown them. And there he saw the rope-swing hanging down,\nand servants above keeping an eye on the road. And when he got into the swing,\nthe servants at the window pulled at the rope and he came to his darling. And\nwhen he had gone in, the counsellor\'s son went back to the old woman\'s house.\n\nBut the prince saw Lily, and her face was beautiful like the full moon, and\nthe moonlight of her beauty shone forth, like the night when the moon shines\nin secret because of the dark. And when she saw him, she threw her arms around\nhis neck and kissed him. So he married her and stayed hidden with her for some\ndays.\n\nOne day he said to his wife: "My dear, my friend the counsellor\'s son came\nwith me, and he is staying all alone at the old woman\'s house. I must go and\nsee him, then I will come back."\n\nBut Lily was shrewd and said: "My dear, I must ask you something. Did you\nunderstand the signs I made, or was it the counsellor\'s son?" And the prince\nsaid to her: "My dear, I did not understand them all, but my friend has\nwonderful wisdom. He understood everything and told me." Then the sweet girl\nthought, and said: "My dear, you did wrong not to tell me before. Your friend\nis a real brother to me. I ought to have sent him some nuts and other nice\nthings at the very first."\n\nThen she let him go, and he went to his friend by night by the same road, and\ntold all that his wife had said. But the counsellor\'s son said: "That is\nfoolish," and did not think much of it. So they spent he night talking.\n\nThen when the time for the twilight sacrifice came, a friend of Lily\'s came\nthere with cooked rice and nuts in her hand. She came and asked the\ncounsellor\'s son about his health and gave him the present. And she cleverly\ntried to keep the prince from eating. "Your wife is expecting you to dinner,"\nshe said, and a moment later she went away.\n\nThen the counsellor\'s son said to the prince: "Look, your Majesty. I will show\nyou something curious." So he took a little of the cooked rice and gave it to\na dog that was there. And the moment he ate it, the dog died. And the prince\nasked the counsellor\'s son what this strange thing could mean.\n\nAnd he replied: "Your Majesty, she knew that I was clever because I understood\nher signs, and she wanted to kill me out of love for you. For she thought the\nprince would not be all her own while I was alive, but would leave her for my\nsake and go back to his own city. So she sent me poisoned food to eat. But you\nmust not be angry with her. I will think up some scheme."\n\nThen the prince praised the counsellor\'s son, and said: "You are truly the\nbody of wisdom." And then suddenly a great wailing of grief-stricken people\nwas heard: "Alas! Alas! The king\'s little son is dead."\n\nWhen he heard this, the counsellor\'s son was delighted, and said: "Your\nMajesty, go to-night to Lily\'s house, and make her drink wine until she loses\nher senses and seems to be dead. Then as she lies there, make a mark on her\nhip with a red-hot fork, steal her jewels, and come back the old way through\nthe window. After that I will do the right thing."\n\nThen he made a three-pronged fork and gave it to the prince. And the prince\ntook the crooked, cruel thing, hard as the weapon of Death, and went by night\nas before to Lily\'s house. "A king," he thought, "ought not to disregard the\nwords of a high-minded counsellor." So when he had stupefied her with wine, he\nbranded her hip with the fork, stole her jewels, returned to his friend, and\ntold him everything, showing him the jewels.\n\nThen the counsellor\'s son felt sure his scheme was successful. He went to the\ncemetery in the morning, and disguised himself as a hermit, and the prince as\nhis pupil. And he said: "Take this pearl necklace from among the jewels. Go\nand sell it in the market-place. And if the policemen arrest you, say this:\nIt was given to me to sell by my teacher.\' "\n\nSo the prince went to the market-place and stood there offering the pearl\nnecklace for sale, and he was arrested while doing it by the policemen. And as\nthey were eager to find out about the theft of the jewels from Bite\'s\ndaughter, they took the prince at once to the chief of police. And when he saw\nthat the culprit was dressed like a hermit, he asked him very gently: "Holy\nsir, where did you get this pearl necklace? It belongs to Bite\'s daughter and\nwas stolen." Then the prince said to them: "Gentlemen, my teacher gave it to\nme to sell. You had better go and ask him."\n\nThen the chief of police went and asked him: "Holy sir, how did this pearl\nnecklace come into your pupil\'s hand?"\n\nAnd the shrewd counsellor\'s son whispered to him: "Sir, as I am a hermit, I\nwander about all the time in this region. And as I happened to be here in this\ncemetery, I saw a whole company of witches who came here at night. And one of\nthe witches split open the heart of a king\'s son, and offered it to her\nmaster. She was mad with wine, and screwed up her face most horribly. But when\nshe impudently tried to snatch my rosary as I prayed, I became angry, and\nbranded her on the hip with a three-pronged fork which I had made red-hot with\na magic spell. And I took this pearl necklace from her neck. Then, as it was\nnot a thing for a hermit, I sent it to be sold."\n\nWhen he heard this, the chief of police went and told the whole story to the\nking. And when the king heard and saw the evidence, he sent the old woman, who\nwas reliable, to identify the pearl necklace. And he heard from her that Lily\nwas branded on the hip.\n\nThen he was convinced that she was really a witch and had devoured his son. So\nhe went himself to the counsellor\'s son, who was disguised as a hermit, and\nasked how Lily should be punished. And by his advice, she was banished from\nthe city, though her parents wept. So she was banished naked to the forest and\nknew that the counsellor\'s son had done it all, but she did not die.\n\nAnd at nightfall the prince and the counsellor\'s son put off their hermit\ndisguise, mounted on horseback, and found her weeping. They put her on a horse\nand took her to their own country. And when they got there, the prince lived\nmost happily with her.\n\nBut Bite thought that his daughter was eaten by wild beasts in the wood, and\nhe died of grief. And his wife died with him.\n\nWhen he had told this story, the goblin asked the king: "O King, who was to\nblame for the death of the parents: the prince, or the counsellor\'s son, or\nLily? You seem like a very wise man, so resolve my doubts on this point. If\nyou know and do not tell me the truth, then your head will surely fly into a\nhundred pieces. And if you give a good answer, then I will jump from your\nshoulder and go back to the sissoo tree."\n\nThen King Triple-victory said to the goblin: "You are a master of magic. You\nsurely know yourself, but I will tell you. It was not the fault of any of the\nthree you mentioned. It was entirely the fault of King Ear-lotus."\n\nBut the goblin said: "How could it be the king\'s fault? The other three did\nit. Are the crows to blame when the geese eat up the rice?"\n\nThen the king said: "But those three are not to blame. It was right for the\ncounsellor\'s son to do his master\'s business. So he is not to blame. And Lily\nand the prince were madly in love and could not stop to think. They only\nlooked after their own affairs. They are not to blame.\n\n"But the king knew the law-books very well, and he had spies to find out the\nfacts among the people. And he knew about the doings of rascals. So he acted\nwithout thinking. He is to blame."\n\nWhen the goblin heard this, he wanted to test the king\'s constancy. So he went\nback by magic in a moment to the sissoo tree. And the king went back\nfearlessly to get him.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Second Goblin: The Three Lovers who brought the Dead Girl to Life.\nWhose wife should she be?](ttg03.htm)\n\n'
