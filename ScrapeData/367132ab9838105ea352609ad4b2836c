And because (the cause) is perceived in the existence of the effect.\n\nThis means--because gold which is the cause is perceived in the existence of\nits effects, such as earrings and the like; i.e. on account of the recognition\nof gold which expresses itself in the judgment 'this earring is gold.' We do\nnot on the other hand perceive the presence of clay, and so on, in gold, and\nso on. The case of the cause and the effect is thus analagous to that of the\nchild and the youth: the word 'effect' denotes nothing else but the causal\nsubstance which\n\np. 464\n\nhas passed over into a different condition. He also who holds the effect to be\na new thing acknowledges that the effect is connected with a different state,\nand as this different state suffices to account for the difference of ideas\nand words, we are not entitled to assume a new substance which is not\nperceived. Nor must it be said that the recognition of the gold in the earring\nis due to generic nature (the two _things_ being different, but having the\nsame generic nature); for we perceive no new substance which could be the\nabode of the generic character. What we actually perceive is one and the same\nsubstance possessing the generic characteristics of gold, first in the causal\nstate and then in the effected state. Nor again can it be said that even on\nthe supposition of difference of substance, recognition of the cause in the\neffect results from the continuity of the so-called intimate cause (samavayi-\nkara,ina). For where there is difference of substances we do not observe that\nmere continuity of the abode gives rise to the recognition (of one substance)\nin the other substance residing in that abode.-But in the case of certain\neffects, as e.g. scorpions and other vermin which originate from dung, that\nrecognition of the causal substance, i.e. dung (to which you refer as proving\nthe identity of cause and effect), is not observed to take place!--You\nmisstate the case, we reply; here also we _do_ recognise in the effect that\nsubstance which is the primal cause, viz. earth.--But in smoke, which is the\neffect of fire, we do not recognise fire!--True! but this does not disprove\nour case. Fire is only the operative cause of smoke; for smoke originates from\ndamp fuel joined with fire. That smoke is the effect of damp fuel is proved\nthereby, as well as that both have smell (which shows them to be alike of the\nsubstance of earth).--As thus the identity of the substance is perceived in\nthe effect also, we are entitled to conclude that the difference of ideas and\nterms rests on difference of state only. The effect, therefore, is non-\ndifferent from the cause.--This is so for the following reason also.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 17.
