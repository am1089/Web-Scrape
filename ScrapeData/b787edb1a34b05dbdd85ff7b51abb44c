The difficulty of\nfinding translators, both willing and competent to take a part in it, proved\nfar greater than I had anticipated. Even when I had secured the assistance of\na number of excellent scholars, and had received their promises of prompt co-\noperation, illness, domestic affliction, and even death asserted their control\nover all human affairs. Professor Childers, who had shown the warmest interest\nin our work, and on whom I chiefly depended for the Pali literature of the\nBuddhists, was taken from us, an irreparable loss to Oriental scholarship in\ngeneral, and to our undertaking in particular. Among native scholars, whose\nco-operation I had been particularly desired to secure, Rajendralal Mitra, who\nhad promised a translation of the Vayu-pura _n_ a, was prevented by serious\nillness from fulfilling his engagement. In other cases sorrow and sickness\nhave caused, at all events, serious delay in the translation of the very books\nwhich were to have inaugurated this Series. However, new offers of assistance\nhave come, and I hope that more may still come from Oriental scholars both in\nIndia and England, so that the limit of time which had been originally\n\np. xl\n\nassigned to the publication of twenty-four volumes may not, I hope, be much\nexceeded.\n\n##### THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE EAST, TRANSLATED, WITH INTRODUCTIONS AND NOTES,\nBY VARIOUS ORIENTAL SCHOLARS, AND EDITED BY F. MAX MULLER.\n\nApart from the interest which the Sacred Books of all religions possess in the\neyes of the theologian, and, more particularly, of the missionary, to whom an\naccurate knowledge of them is as indispensable as a knowledge of the enemy's\ncountry is to a general, these works have of late assumed a new importance, as\nviewed in the character of ancient historical documents. In every country\nwhere Sacred Books have been preserved, whether by oral tradition or by\nwriting, they are the oldest records, and mark the beginning of what may be\ncalled documentary, in opposition to purely traditional, history.\n\nThere is nothing more ancient in India than the Vedas; and, if we except the\nVedas and the literature connected with them, there is again no literary work\nin India which, so far as we know at present, can with certainty be referred\nto an earlier date than that of the Sacred Canon of the Buddhists. Whatever\nage we may assign to the various portions of the Avesta and to their final\narrangement, there is no book in the Persian language of greater antiquity\nthan the Sacred Books of the followers of Zarathustra, nay, even than their\ntranslation in Pehlevi. There may have been an extensive ancient literature in\nChina long before Khung-fu-\xca\x93ze and Lao-\xca\x93ze, but among all that was rescued and\npreserved of it, the five King and the four Shu claim again the highest\nantiquity. As to the Koran, it is known to be the fountain-head both of the\nreligion and of the literature of the Arabs.\n\nThis being the case, it was but natural that the attention of the historian\nshould of late have been more strongly attracted by these Sacred Books, as\nlikely to afford most valuable information, not only on the religion, but also\non the moral sentiments, the social institutions, the legal maxims of some of\nthe most important nations of antiquity. There are not many nations that have\npreserved sacred writings, and many of those that have been preserved have but\nlately become accessible to us in their original form, through the rapid\nadvance of Oriental scholarship in Europe. Neither Greeks, nor Romans, nor\nGermans, nor Celts, nor Slaves have left us anything that deserves the name of\nSacred Books. The\n\np. xli\n\n[paragraph continues] Homeric Poems are national Epics, like the Ramaya _n_ a,\nand the Nibelunge, and the Homeric Hymns have never received that general\nrecognition or sanction which alone can impart to the poetical effusions of\npersonal piety the sacred or canonical character which is the distinguishing\nfeature of the Vedic Hymns. The sacred literature of the early inhabitants of\nItaly seems to have been of a liturgical rather than of a purely religious\nkind, and whatever the Celts, the Germans, the Slaves may have possessed of\nsacred traditions about their gods and heroes, having been handed down by oral\ntradition chiefly, has perished beyond all hope of recovery. Some portions of\nthe Eddas alone give us an idea of what the religious and heroic poetry of the\nScandinavians may have been. The Egyptians possessed Sacred Books, and some of\nthem, such as the Book of the Dead, have come down to us in various forms.\nThere is a translation of the Book of the Dead by Dr. Birch, published in the\nfifth volume of Bunsen's Egypt, and a new edition and translation of this\nimportant work may be expected from the combined labours of Birch, Chabas,\nLepsius, and Naville, In Babylon and Assyria, too, important fragments of what\nmay be called a Sacred Literature have lately come to light. The\ninterpretation, however, of these Hieroglyphic and Cuneiform texts is as yet\nso difficult that, for the present, they are of interest to the scholar only,\nand hardly available for historical purposes.\n\nLeaving out of consideration the Jewish and Christian Scriptures, it appears\nthat the only great and original religions which profess to be founded on\nSacred Books 1, and have preserved them in manuscript, are:--\n\n1\\. The religion of the Brahmans.  \n2\\. The religion of the followers of Buddha.  \n3\\. The religion of the followers of Zarathustra.  \n4\\. The religion of the followers of Khung-fu-\xca\x93ze.  \n5\\. The religion of the followers of Lao-\xca\x93ze.  \n6\\. The religion of the followers of Mohammed.\n\nA desire for a trustworthy translation of the Sacred Books of these six\nEastern religions has often been expressed. Several have been translated into\nEnglish, French, German, or Latin, but in some cases these translations are\ndifficult to procure, in others they are loaded with notes and commentaries,\nwhich are intended for\n\np. xlii\n\nstudents by profession only. Oriental scholars have been blamed for not having\nas yet supplied a want so generally felt, and so frequently expressed, as a\ncomplete, trustworthy, and readable translation of the principal Sacred Books\nof the Eastern Religions. The reasons, however, why hitherto they have shrunk\nfrom such an undertaking are clear enough. The difficulties in many cases of\ngiving complete translations, and not selections only, are very great. There\nis still much work to be done in a critical restoration of the original texts,\nin an examination of their grammar and metres, and in determining the exact\nmeaning of many words and passages. That kind of work is naturally far more\nattractive to scholars than a mere translation, particularly when they cannot\nbut feel that, with the progress of our knowledge, many a passage which now\nseems clear and easy, may, on being re-examined, assume a new import. Thus\nwhile scholars who are most competent to undertake a translation, prefer to\ndevote their time to more special researches, the work of a complete\ntranslation is deferred to the future, and historians are left under the\nimpression that Oriental scholarship is still in so unsatisfactory a state as\nto make any reliance on translations of the Veda, the Avesta, or the Tao-te\nKing extremely hazardous.\n\nIt is clear, therefore, that a translation of the principal Sacred Books of\nthe East can be carried out only at a certain sacrifice. Scholars must leave\nfor a time their own special researches in order to render the general results\nalready obtained accessible to the public at large. And even then, really\nuseful results can be achieved viribus unitis only. If four of the best\nEgyptologists have to combine in order to produce a satisfactory edition and\ntranslation of one of the Sacred Books of ancient Egypt, a much larger number\nof Oriental scholars will be required for translating the Sacred Books of the\nBrahmans, the Buddhists, the Zoroastrians, the followers of Khung-fu-\xca\x93ze, Lao-\n\xca\x93ze, and Mohammed.\n\nLastly, there was the most serious difficulty of all, a difficulty which no\nscholar could remove, viz. the difficulty of finding the funds necessary for\ncarrying out so large an undertaking. No doubt there exists at present a very\nkeen interest in questions connected with the origin, the growth, and decay of\nreligion. But much of that interest is theoretic rather than historical. How\npeople might or could or should have elaborated religious ideas, is a topic\nmost warmly discussed among psychologists and theologians, but a study of the\ndocuments, in which alone the actual growth of religious thought can be\ntraced, is much neglected.\n\np. xliii\n\n[paragraph continues] A faithful, unvarnished prose translation of the Sacred\nBooks of India, Persia, China, and Arabia, though it may interest careful\nstudents, will never, I fear, excite a widespread interest, or command a\ncirculation large enough to make it a matter of private enterprise and\ncommercial speculation.\n\nNo doubt there is much in these old books that is startling by its very\nsimplicity and truth, much that is elevated and elevating, much that is\nbeautiful and sublime; but people who have vague ideas of primeval wisdom and\nthe splendour of Eastern poetry will soon find themselves grievously\ndisappointed. It cannot be too strongly stated, that the chief, and, in many\ncases, the only interest of the Sacred Books of the East is historical; that\nmuch in them is extremely childish, tedious, if not repulsive; and that no one\nbut the historian will be able to understand the important lessons which they\nteach. It would have been impossible to undertake a translation even of the\nmost important only of the Sacred Books of the East, without the support of an\nAcademy or a University which recognises the necessity of rendering these\nworks more generally accessible, on the same grounds on which it recognises\nthe duty of collecting and exhibiting in Museums the petrifactions of bygone\nages, little concerned whether the public admires the beauty of fossilised\nplants and broken skeletons, as long as hard-working students find there some\nlight for reading once more the darker pages in the history of the earth.\n\nHaving been so fortunate as to secure that support, having also received\npromises of assistance from some of the best Oriental scholars in England and\nIndia, I hope I shall be able, after the necessary preparations are completed,\nto publish about three volumes of translations every year, selecting from the\nstores of the six so-called 'Book-religions' those works which at present can\nbe translated, and which are most likely to prove useful. All translations\nwill be made from the original texts, and where good translations exist\nalready, they will be carefully revised by competent scholars. Such is the\nbulk of the religious literature of the Brahmans and the Buddhists, that to\nattempt a complete translation would be far beyond the powers of one\ngeneration of scholars. Still, if the interest in the work itself should\ncontinue, there is no reason why this series of translations should not be\ncarried on, even after those who commenced it shall have ceased from their\nlabours.\n\nWhat I contemplate at present and I am afraid at my time of life even this may\nseem too sanguine, is no more than a Series\n\np. xliv\n\nof twenty-four volumes, the publication of which will probably extend over\neight years. In this Series I hope to comprehend the following books, though I\ndo not pledge myself to adhere strictly to this outline:--\n\n1\\. From among the Sacred Books of the Brahmans I hope to give a translation\nof the Hymns of the Rig-veda. While I shall continue my translation of\nselected hymns of that Veda, a traduction raisonnee which is intended for\nSanskrit scholars only, on the same principles which I have followed in the\nfirst volume 1, explaining every word and sentence that seems to require\nelucidation, and carefully examining the opinions of previous commentators,\nboth native and European, I intend to contribute a freer translation of the\nhymns to this Series, with a few explanatory notes only, such as are\nabsolutely necessary to enable readers who are unacquainted with Sanskrit to\nunderstand the thoughts of the Vedic poets. The translation of perhaps another\nSa _m_ hita, one or two of the Brahma _n_ as, or portions of them, will have\nto be included in our Series, as well as the principal Upanishads, theosophic\ntreatises of great interest and beauty. There is every prospect of an early\nappearance of a translation of the Bhagavad-gita, of the most important among\nthe sacred Law-books, and of one at least of the Puranas. I should have wished\nto include a translation of some of the _G_ ain books, of the Granth of the\nSikhs, and of similar works illustrative of the later developments of religion\nin India, but there is hardly room for them at present.\n\n2\\. The Sacred Books of the Buddhists will be translated chiefly from the two\noriginal collections, the Southern in Pali, the Northern in Sanskrit. Here the\nselection will, no doubt, be most difficult. Among the first books to be\npublished will be, I hope, Sutras from the Digha Nikaya, a part of the Vinaya-\npi _t_ aka, the Dhammapada, the Divyavadana, the Lalita-vistara, or legendary\nlife of Buddha.\n\n3\\. The Sacred Books of the Zoroastrians lie within a smaller compass, but\nthey will require fuller notes and commentaries in order to make a translation\nintelligible and useful.\n\n4\\. The books which enjoy the highest authority with the followers of Khung-\nfu-\xca\x93ze are the King and the Shu. Of the former the Shu King or Book of\nHistory; the Odes of the Temple and\n\np. xlv\n\nthe Altar, and other pieces illustrating the ancient religious views and\npractices of the Chinese, in the Shih King or Book of Poetry; the Yi King; the\nLi _K_ i; and the Hsiao King or Classic of Filial Piety, will all be given, it\nis hoped, entire. Of the latter, the Series will contain the _K_ ung Yung or\nDoctrine of the Mean; the Ta Hsio or Great Learning; all Confucius' utterances\nin the Lun Yu or Confucian Analects, which are of a religious nature, and\nrefer to the principles of his moral system; and Mang-\xca\x93ze's Doctrine of the\nGoodness of Human Nature.\n\n5\\. For the system of Lao-\xca\x93ze we require only a translation of the Tao-teh\nKing with some of its commentaries, and, it may be, an authoritative work to\nillustrate the actual operation of its principles.\n\n6\\. For Islam, all that is essential is a trustworthy translation of the\nKoran.\n\nIt will be my endeavour to divide the twenty-four volumes which are\ncontemplated in this Series as equally as possible among the six religions.\nBut much must depend on the assistance which I receive from Oriental scholars,\nand also on the interest and the wishes of the public.\n\nF.
