On the second and following days of the guest's stay, the host shall not\nrise or descend (from his couch) in order to salute his (guest), if he has\nbeen saluted before (on the first day).\n\n2\\. He shall eat after his guests. 2\n\n3\\. He shall not consume all the flavoured liquids in the house, so as to\nleave nothing for guests. 3\n\n4\\. He shall not cause sweetmeats to be prepared for his own sake. 4\n\n5\\. (A guest) who can repeat the (whole) Veda (together with the supplementary\nbooks) is worthy to receive a cow and the Madhuparka, 5\n\n6\\. (And also) the teacher, an officiating priest, a Snataka, and a just king\n(though not learned in the Veda).\n\n7\\. A cow and the Madhuparka (shall be offered) to the teacher, to an\nofficiating priest, to a father-in-law, and to a king, if they come after a\nyear has elapsed (since their former visit).\n\np. 121\n\n8\\. The Madhuparka shall consist of curds mixed with honey, or of milk mixed\nwith honey. 8\n\n9\\. On failure (of these substances) water (mixed with honey may be used).\n\n10\\. The Veda has six A\xe1\xb9\x85gas (auxiliary works). 10\n\n11\\. (The six auxiliary works are) the Kalpa (teaching the ritual) of the\nVeda, the treatises on grammar, astronomy, etymology, phonetics, and metrics.\n\n12\\. (If any one should contend that) the term Veda (on account of its\netymology, implying that which teaches duty or whereby one obtains spiritual\nmerit) applies to the complete collection of (works which contain) rules for\nrites to be performed on the authority of precepts, (that, consequently, the\nKalpa-sutras form part of the Veda, and that thereby) the number (fixed above)\nfor those (A\xe1\xb9\x85gas) is proved to be wrong, 12\n\n13\\. (Then we answer), All those who are learned in Mima _m_ sa are agreed\nthat (the terms Veda, Brahma _n_ a, and the like, which are applied to) the\nprincipal (works), do not include the A\xe1\xb9\x85gas (the Kalpa-sutras and the rest).\nhe remembers at any time during dinner,\n\n14\\. If he remembers at any time that he has refused a guest, he shall at once\nleave off eating and fast on that day,\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[120:2](sbe0243.htm#fr_604) **8**.
