The text has u _k_ _k_ aistaram\xc2\x97u _k_\n_k_ aistaram, and ni _k_ aistara _m_ \xc2\x97ni _k_ aistaram. Naraya _n_ a(comp. the\ntext of his scholion, p. 155 of the German edition) understands this in a\ndifferent way; he says that in the water-pot mentioned in the fifth Sutra two\ndifferent sthanas are to be distinguished, a higher part of it and a lower\n(uttaradharataya). Now when the sacrificer, for instance, as prescribed in\nSutra 6, invites the Lord of the celestial Serpents, and the celestial\nSerpents to wash themselves, the pouring out of water would have to be\nperformed first thrice for the Lord of the celestial Serpents in the higher\nplace, then thrice for the celestial Serpents in the lower place.\n\n[129:19](sbe29077.htm#fr_289) On the Pratyavaroha _n_ a see chap. 17.\n\n[129:20](sbe29077.htm#fr_290) Naraya _n_ a: vagyamayukta ya _g_ amanapatni eva\n_m_ balidravyadikam upasadayet.\n\n[129:22](sbe29077.htm#fr_291) 'From the _S_ rava _n_ i till the \xc3\x82grahaya _n_ i\n(see chap. 1 7, 1) one shall not sleep on the ground out of fear of the\nsnakes.'
