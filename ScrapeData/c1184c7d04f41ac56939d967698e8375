The Ri _s_ is said :-- O Saumya! How was S\xc2\x92uka Deva born? Who studied\nthese Purana Samhitas; by which wife of Vyasa Deva? And How? O highly\nintelligent one! You have just spoken that S\xc2\x92uka Deva was not born from womb,\nin the natural way; he was born of the dry pieces of wood for Homa sacrifice.\nBut we heard before that the great ascetic was Yogi even in his mother's womb,\nso a great doubt comes to our minds. You better remove that to-day; how he\nstudied also these Puranas, as vast in their nature; say this.\n\n\n\n4-5. Suta said :-- In long-past days, Satyavati's son Vedas Vyas, while in his\nown hermitage on the banks of the river Sarasvati, was greatly wondered to see\na pair of Chatakas (Sparrows). He saw the pair putting the beak of their young\none, just born of the egg, of beautiful body, red mouth, and greasy body. They\ndo not care at all for their own hunger and toil; all they are caring for is\nto nurture their young one. He said also that the pair are rubbing their\nbodies over the body and kissing lovingly the mouth of the young one and\nfeeling the highest pleasure. Seeing this wonderful affection of the two\nsparrows towards their young, Veda Vyas became very anxious and thought over\nthe following in his mind.\n\n\n\np. 9\n\n\n\n9-14. Oh! What wonder is there, when the birds have so much filial affection\ntowards their child, that men, who want services from their sons, would show\ntheir affection towards their sons! This pair of sparrows will not perform the\nhappy marriage of their young one and will not see the face of their son\xc2\x92s\nwife; nor when they will grow old, that their child would become very\nreligious and serve them to attain great merits in Heaven. Nor do they expect\nthat their child would earn money and satisfy them nor the child would perform\nwhen they die, their funeral obsequies duly and help them in their sojourn in\nthe next world; nothing of all these. Nor will the child perform the S\xc2\x92radh\nceremony at Gaya; nor will the child offer the oblation of a blue bull on the\nday of offering the sacrifice to its ancestor (the bull is then let loose and\nheld sacred); yet the pair of sparrows have so much affection towards their\nyoung one! Oh! in this world to touch the body of the son, especially to\nnurture the sons, is the highest happiness in life.\n\n\n\n15-27. There is no prospect in the after birth of the sonless; never, never\nwill Heaven be his. Without son, there is none other who can be of help in the\nnext world. Thus in the Dharma S\xc2\x92astras, Manu and other Munis declare that the\nman who has sons goes to Heaven and the sonless one can never go to Heaven.\nThe man possessing a son is entitled to the Heavenly pleasures can be vividly\nseen, rather than imagined. The man with son is freed from sins; this is the\nword of the Vedas. The sonless man becomes very much distressed even at the\ntime of death and while lying on bed that is ground at that time, mournfully\nthinks. \xc2\x93This all my vast wealth, various things, this my beautiful house, who\nwill enjoy all these?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nWhen the sonless man is thus perplexed in his mind at the time of his death\nand becomes restless, then it is sure that his future career is full\nmisfortunes; unless one\xc2\x92s mind is calm and serene at the time of death, can\nnever attain a good goal. Thus thinking variously, the Satyavati's son Veda\nVyas sighed heavily and became unmindful. He thought of various plans and at\nlast, coming to a definite conclusion, went to the Sumeru mountain to perform\nTapasya. On reaching there, he thought which Deva he will worship! Vi _sn_ u,\nS\xc2\x92iva, Indra, Brahma, Surya, Ganes\xc2\x92a, Kartikeya, Agni, or Varu _n_ a? Who will\ngrant him boon quickly and thus satisfy his desires. While thus cogitating in\nhis mind, came there the Muni Narada, of one mind with lute in hamd,\naccidentally in his course of travels. Seeing Narada, the Satyavati\xc2\x92s son Veda\nVyasa gave him a hearty welcome, with great gladness, offering him Arghya and\n\xc3\x82san (seat) and asked about his welfare. Hearing this question of welfare,\nNarada Muni spoke :-- \xc2\x93O Dvaipayan! Why do you look so care worn! First speak\nthis out to me\xc2\x94.\n\n\n\np. 10\n\n\n\n28-30. Veda Vyasa said :-- \xc2\x93 The sonless man has no goal; therefore there is\nno happiness in my mind; I am always anxious to get a son and therefore I am\nvery sorry. To-day my mind is sorely troubled with the one idea, which Deva I\nmay satisfy by my tapasya, who will grant me my desires; now I take your\nrefuge. O merciful Mahar _s_ i! You are omniscient; say this quickly; which\nDeva I will take for my refuge, who will grant me a son\xc2\x94.\n\n\n\n31-37. Suta said :-- Thus questioned by Kri _sn_ a Dvaipayan Veda Vyasa, the\nhigh souled Narada Muni, well versed in the Vedas, became very glad and spoke\nthus :-- O highly fortunate Paras'ara\xc2\x92s son. The question that you have asked\nme to-day was formerly asked by my father to Narayana. At this, Narayana\nVasudeva, the Deva of the Devas, the Creator, Preserver and Destroyer of the\nUniverse, the husband of Lak _s_ mi, the four armed, wearing yellow garment,\nholding conchshell, discus, club and with the mark S\xc2\x92rivatsa (a mark or curl\nof hair on the heart of Vi _sn_ u) adorning His breast and decorated with\nKaustuvagem, the Divinity Himself, became merged in great Yoga; at this my\nFather became greatly surprised and said :-- \xc2\x93O Janardana! Thou art the Deva\nof the Devas; the Lord of the Present, the Past and the Future, the Lord of\nthis Universe; why art thou meditating in Yoga? And what is it that Thou art\nmeditating? O best of the Devas! Thou art the Lord of the entire Universe and\nyet Thou art now merged in deep meditation. At this I am greatly surprised (my\nsurprise is not without foundation; Thou canst Thyself see). What more\nwonderful than this can happen?\n\n\n\n38-43. O Lord of Rama! I am sprung from the lotus from thy navel and have\nbecome the Lord of this whole universe; who is there in this universe that is\nsuperior to Thee; kindly say this to me. O Lord of the world? Thou art the\nOrigin of all, the Cause of all causes, the Creator, Preserver and Destroyer\nand the capable Doer of all actions. O Maharaja! at Thy will, I create this\nwhole universe and Rudra destroys iu due time this world. He is always under\nThy command. O Lord! By Thy command the Sun roams in the sky; the wind blows\nin various auspicious or inauspicious ways and the fire is giving heat and the\ncloud showers rain. I don\xc2\x92t see in the three Lokas any one superior to Thee.\nThen whom art Thou meditating while being questioned by his very intelligent\nson S\xc2\x92uka Deva! not born in the usual way from womb, Dvaipayana expounded all\nthe secret excellent meanings of the Pura _n_ a and thereby I also came to\nknow them also. O saintly persons! Thus S\xc2\x92uka Deva, sincerely earnest to cross\nthis endless bottomless ocean of S\xc2\x92amsara, tasted of the wonderful traits of\nthe Veda, the Kalpa tree, this S\xc2\x92rimad Bhagavata with its numerous stories and\nanecdotes with great eagerness and intense pleasure.\n\n\n\np. 11\n\n\n\n38-43. Oh! Who is there in this world that is not freed from this terror of\nKali, after he has heard this Bhagavata. Even if the greatest sinner, void of\nthe right ways of living and Achara as ordained in the Vedas, hears on a\npretence this excellent Devi Bhagavata, the chief of the Pura _n_ as, he\nenjoys all the great enjoyments of this world and in the end attains the\neternal place occupied by the Yogis. She who is rare, in Her Nirguna aspect,\nto even Hari and Hara, who is very dear as Tattva Vidya to the J\xc3\xb1anins whose\nreal nature can be realised only in Samadhi, She resides always in the cavity\nof the heart of the hearers of the Bhagavata Pura _n_ a. He who getting the\nall qualified human birth and getting the reciter of this Pura _n_ a, the boat\nto cross, as it were, this world, does not hear this blissful Purana, he is\ncertainly deprived by the Creator. How is it that the way-ward dull-headed\npersons, getting the vicious ears, can hear always the faults and calumnies of\nothers, that are entirely useless, and cannot hear this pure Pura _n_ a that\ncontains the four Vargas :-- Dharma, Artha, Kama, and Mokh _s_ a?\n\n\n\nThis is my main point of doubt. O One of good vows! I am Thy devotee; be\nmerciful to me and speak this to me. There is almost nothing that is secret to\nMahapuru _s_ as; this is a well-known fact\xc2\x94.\n\n\n\n44-50. Thus hearing Brahma's words, Bhagavan Narayana spoke :-- \xc2\x93O Brahman! I\nnow speak out my mind to you; listen carefully. Though the Devas, Danavas and\nmen and all the Lokas know that You are the Creator, I am the Preserver and\nRudra is the Destroyer, yet it is to be known that the saints, versed in the\nVedas, have come to this conclusion by inference from the Vedas that the\ncreation, preservation, and destruction are performed by the creative force,\npreservative force and destructive force. The Rajasik creative force residing\nin you, the Sattvik preservative force residing in me, and the Tamasik\ndestructive force residing in Rudra are the all-in-all. When these Saktis\nbecome absent, you become inert and incapable to create, I to preserve and\nRudra to destroy.\n\n\n\nO intelligent Suvrata! We all are always under that Force directly or\nindirectly; hear instances that you can see and infer. At the time of Pralaya,\nI lie down on the bed of Ananta, subservient to that Force; again I wake up in\nthe time of creation duly under the influence of Time.\n\n\n\n51-54. I am always subservient to that Maha S\xc2\x92akti; (under Her command) I am\nengaged in Tapasya for a long time; (By Her command) some time I enjoy with\nLak _s_ hmi; some time I fight battles, terrible to all the Lokas, with the\nDanavas, involving great bodily troubles. O Know of Dharma! It was before Your\npresence that I fought hand to hand fight for five thousand years before Your\nsight on that one great ocean\n\n\n\np. 12\n\n\n\nin long-past days with the two demons Madhu and Kaitabha, sprung from the wax\nof my ear, maddened with pride; and by the grace of the Devi, successfully\nkilled the two Danavas.\n\n\n\n55-61. O highly fortunate one! you realised then the great S\xc2\x92akti, higher than\nthe highest and the cause of all causes; then why are you asking again and\nagain that question. By the will of that S\xc2\x92akti, I have got this idea of man\nand roam on the great ocean; in yuga after yuga, I assume by Her will, the\nTortoise, Boar, Man-Lion, and Dwarf incarnations. No one likes to take birth\nin the womb of inferior animals (especially birds). Do you think that I\nwillingly take unpleasant births as in the womb of boars, tortoise, i.e.,\ncertainly not. What independent man is there who abandons the pleasurable\nenjoyment with Lak _s_ mi and takes birth in inferior animals as fish, etc. or\nleaves his seat on the seat of Ga _d_ u _d_ a and becomes engaged in great\nwar-conflicts. O Svayambhu! In ancient days you saw before your eyes that my\nhead was cut off when the bowstring suddenly gave way; and then you, brought a\nhorse's head and by that help, the divine artist Visvakarma, stuck that on to\nmy headless body. O Brahma! Since then I am known amongst men by the name of\n\xc2\x93Hayagriva\xc2\x94. This is well-known to you. Now say, were I independent, would\nsuch an ignominy have happened to me? Never. Therefore I am not independent; I\nam in every way under that S\xc2\x92akti. O Lotus-born! I always meditate on that\nS\xc2\x92akti; and I do not know any other than this S\xc2\x92akti\xc2\x94.\n\n\n\n62-66. Narada said :-- Thus spoke Vi _sn_ u to Brahma. O Muni Vedavyas! Brahma\nspoke these to me. So you, too, better meditate the lotus feet of Bhagavati\ncalmly in the lotus of your heart for the success of your idea. That Devi will\ngive you all that you wish. Suta said :-- At these words of Narada,\nSatyavati's son Veda Vyasa went out to the hills for Tapasya, trusting the\nlotus feet of the Devi as the all-in-all in this world.\n\n\n\nThus ends the fourth chapter of the first Skandha on the excellency of the\nDevi in the Mahapurana S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 5](bk01ch05.htm)\n\n"
