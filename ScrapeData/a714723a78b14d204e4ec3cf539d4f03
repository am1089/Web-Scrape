The presence (of a body and senses) _G_ aimini (asserts); because the\ntext records option (of the released person multiplying himself).\n\nThe teacher _G_ aimini is of opinion that the released person possesses a body\nand sense-organs as well as a mind. For passages like 'He is onefold, he is\nthreefold' ( _Kh_. Up. VII, 26, 2) declare that the Self has the option of\nmanifold existence which cannot be brought about without manifoldness of body.\n--The capability of optionally multiplying one's self is, indeed, mentioned in\nthe knowledge of plenitude (bhuman) which refers to Brahman as devoid of\nqualities, but this lordly power which is valid only for the qualified state\nis there mentioned only in order to glorify the knowledge of the (unqualified)\nplenitude; and it therefore presents itself as constituting the fruit of\nqualified knowledge 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[412:1](sbe38327.htm#fr_233) Manifoldness of the Self is mentioned in a vidya\nreferring to the highest Brahman; but its introduction there is not due to the\nwish of teaching something about that state, but merely of, rhetorically,\nglorifying it. We, therefore, are entitled to view that passage as teaching\nsomething about him who possesses the lower knowledge.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 4, 12](sbe38328.htm)\n\n"
