The Naradiya Puran\xcc\x81a\n\n6\\. Narada or Naradiya Puran\xcc\x81a. "Where Narada has described the duties which\nwere observed in the Vrihat Kalpa, that, is called the Naradiya,\n\np. xxxii\n\nhaving twenty-five thousand stanzas 53." If the number of verses be here\ncorrectly stated, the Puran\xcc\x81a has not fallen into my hands. The copy I have\nanalysed contains not many more than three thousand \xc5\x9blokas. There is another\nwork, which might be expected to be of greater extent, the Vrihat Naradiya, or\ngreat Narada Puran\xcc\x81a; but this, according to the concurrence of three copies\nin my possession, and of five others in the Company\'s library, contains but\nabout three thousand five hundred verses. It may be doubted, therefore, if the\nNarada Puran\xcc\x81a of the Matsya exists 54.\n\nAccording to the Matsya, the Narada Puran\xcc\x81a is related by Narada, and gives an\naccount of the Vrihat Kalpa. The Naradiya Puran\xcc\x81a is communicated by Narada to\nthe Rishis at Naimisharan\xcc\x81ya, on the Gomati river. The Vrihannaradiya is\nrelated to the same persons, at the same place, by Suta, as it was told by\nNarada to Sanatkumara. Possibly the term Vrihat may have been suggested by the\nspecification which is given in the Matsya; but there is no description in it\nof any particular Kalpa, or day of Brahma.\n\nFrom a cursory examination of these Puran\xcc\x81as, it is very evident that they\nhave no conformity to the definition of a Puran\xcc\x81a, and that both are sectarial\nand modern compilations, intended to support the doctrine of Bhakti, or faith\nin Vishn\xcc\x81u. With this view they have collected a variety of prayers addressed\nto one or other form of that divinity; a number of observances and holidays\nconnected with his adoration; and different legends, some perhaps of an early,\nothers of a more recent date, illustrative of the efficacy of devotion to\nHari. Thus in the Narada we have the stories of Dhruva and Prahlada; the\nlatter told in the words of the Vishn\xcc\x81u: whilst the second portion of it is\noccupied with a legend of Mohini, the will-born daughter of a king called\nRukmangada: beguiled by\n\np. xxxiii\n\nwhom, the king offers to perform for her whatever she may desire. She calls\nupon him either to violate the rule of fasting on the eleventh day of the\nfortnight, a day sacred to Vishn\xcc\x81u, or to put his son to death; and he kills\nhis son, as the lesser sin of the two. This shews the spirit of the work. Its\ndate may also be inferred from its tenor, as such monstrous extravagancies in\npraise of Bhakti are certainly of modern origin. One limit it furnishes\nitself, for it refers to \xc5\x9auka and Parikshit, the interlocutors of the\nBhagavata, and it is consequently subsequent to the date of that Puran\xcc\x81a: it\nis probably considerably later, for it affords evidence that it was written\nafter India was in the hands of the Mohammedans. In the concluding passage it\nis said, "Let not this Puran\xcc\x81a be repeated in the presence of the \'killers of\ncows\' and contemners of the gods." It is possibly a compilation of the\nsixteenth or seventeenth century.\n\nThe Vrihannaradiya is a work of the same tenor and time. It contains little\nelse than panegyrical prayers addressed to Vishn\xcc\x81u, and injunctions to observe\nvarious rites, and keep holy certain seasons, in honour of him. The earlier\nlegends introduced are the birth of Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya, the destruction of Sagara\'s\nsons, and the dwarf Avatara; but they are subservient to the design of the\nwhole, and are rendered occasions for praising Narayan\xcc\x81a: others, illustrating\nthe efficacy of certain Vaishn\xcc\x81ava observances, are puerile inventions, wholly\nforeign to the more ancient system of Pauran\xcc\x81ik fiction. There is no attempt\nat cosmogony, or patriarchal or regal genealogy. It is possible that these\ntopics may be treated of in the missing stanzas; but it seems more likely that\nthe Narada Puran\xcc\x81a of the lists has little in common with the works to which\nits name is applied in Bengal and Hindustan.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xxxii:53](vp010.htm#fr_52) [![](tn/generic.jpg)  \nClick to view](img/_03200.jpg)\n\n[xxxii:54](vp010.htm#fr_53) The description of Vishn\xcc\x81u, translated by Col.\nVans Kennedy (Affinity of Ancient and Hindu Mythology, p. 200) from the\nNaradiya Puran\xcc\x81a, occurs in my copy of the Vrihat Naradiya. There is no Narada\nPuran\xcc\x81a in the East India Company\'s library, though, as noticed in the text,\nseveral of the Vrihat Naradiya. There is a copy of the Rukmangada Charitra,\nsaid to be a part of the \xc5\x9ari Narada Puran\xcc\x81a.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 7. The Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya Puran\xcc\x81a](vp011.htm)\n\n'
