Some of these mistakes have been removed by\nProfessor Aufrecht, others, however, appear in his transcript as they appear\nin my own edition.\n\nI need hardly point out passages where palpable misprints in my edition have\nbeen repeated in Professor Aufrecht's text. I mean by palpable misprints,\ncases where a glance at the Pada text or at the Sa _m_ hita text or a\nreference to Saya _n_ a's commentary would show at once what was intended.\nThus, for instance, in VI, 15, 3. v _ri_ dhe, as I had printed in the Sa _m_\nhita, was clearly a misprint for v _ri_ dho, as may be seen from the Pada,\nwhich gives v _ri_ dha _h_ , and from Saya _n_ a. Here, though Professor\nAufrecht repeats v _ri_ dhe, I think it hardly necessary to show that the\nauthority of the best MSS. (S 2 alone contains a correction of v _ri_ dho to v\n_ri_ dhe) is in favour of v _ri_ dha _h_ , whatever we may think of the\nrelative value of these two readings. One must be careful, however, in a text\nlike that of the Vedic hymns, where the presence or absence of a single letter\nor accent begins to become\n\np. lvi\n\nthe object of the most learned and painstaking discussions, not to claim too\nlarge an indulgence for misprints. A misprint in the Sa _m_ hita, if repeated\nin the Pada, or if admitted even in the commentary of Saya _n_ a, though it\nneed not be put down to the editor's deplorable ignorance, becomes yet a\nserious matter, and I willingly take all the blame which is justly due for\noccasional accidents of this character. Such are, for instance, II, 12, 14,\n_s_ a _s_ amanam instead of _s_ a _s_ amanam; I, 124, 4, _s_ udhyuva _h_ , in\nthe Pada, instead of _s_ undhyuva _h_ ; and the substitution in several places\nof a short u instead of a long u in such forms as _s_ u _s_ avama, when\noccurring in the Pada; cf. I, 166, 14; 167, 9.\n\nIt is clear from the Prati _s_ akhya, Sutra 819 and 163, 5, that the words\nuti\xc2\xb4 indra in IV, 29, I, should not be joined together, but that the hiatus\nshould remain. Hence uti\xc2\xb4ndra, as printed in my edition and repeated in\nProfessor Aufrecht's, should be corrected, and the hiatus be preserved, as it\nis in the fourth verse of the same hymn, uti\xc2\xb4 ittha\xc2\xb4. MSS. S 1, S 3 are right;\nin S 2 the words are joined.\n\nIt follows from Sutra 799 that to double the y in vaiya _s_ va is a mistake,\nbut a mistake which had to be pointed out and guarded against as early as the\ntime of the Prati _s_ akhya. In VIII, 26, 11, therefore, vaiyya _s_ vasya, as\nprinted in my edition and repeated in Professor Aufrecht's, should be changed\nto vaiya _s_ vasya. MSS. S 1, S 3 are right, likewise P 1, P 2; but S 2 has\nthe double mistake vayya _s_ vasya, as described in the Prati _s_ akhya;\nanother MS. of Wilson's has vaiyy. The same applies to VIII, 23, 24, and VIII,\n24, 23. P 1 admits the mistaken spelling vayya _s_ va.\n\nSome corrections that ought to be made in the Padapa _th_ a only, as printed\nin my edition, are pointed out in a note to Sutra 738 of the Prati _s_ akhya.\nThus, according to Sutra 583, 6, _s_ ruya\xc2\xb4 _h_ in the Pada text of II, 10, 2,\nshould be changed to _s_ ruya\xc2\xb4 _h_. MSS. P 1, P 2 have the short u.\n\nIn V, 7, 8, I had printed _s_ u _k_ i _h_ shma, leaving the a of\n\np. lvii\n\nshma short in accordance with the Prati _s_ akhya, Sutra 514, where a string\nof words is given before which sma must not be lengthened, and where under No.\n11 we find yasmai. Professor Aufrecht has altered this, and gives the a as\nlong, which is wrong. The MSS. S 1, S 2, S 3 have the short a.\n\nAnother word before which sma ought not to be lengthened is ma\xc2\xb4vate. Hence,\naccording to Sutra 514, 14, I ought not to have printed in VI, 65, 4, shma\nma\xc2\xb4vate, but shma ma\xc2\xb4vate. Here Professor Aufrecht has retained the long a,\nwhich is wrong. MSS. S 1, S 2, S 3 have the short a.\n\nIt follows from Sutra 499 that in I, 138, 4, we should not lengthen the vowel\nof su. Hence, instead of asya\xc2\xb4 u shu\xc2\xb4 _n_ a upa sataye, as printed in my\nedition and repeated by Professor Aufrecht, we should read asya\xc2\xb4 u shu _n_ a\nupa sataye. S 1, S 2, S 3 have short u a.\n\nIn VII, 31, 4, I had by mistake printed viddhi instead of viddhi\xc2\xb4. The same\nreading is adopted by Professor Aufrecht (II, p. 24), but the authority of the\nPrati _s_ akhya, Sutra 445, can hardly be overruled. S 1, S 2, S 3 have\nviddhi\xc2\xb4.\n\nWhile in cases like these, the Prati _s_ akhya is an authority which, as far\nas I can judge, ought to overrule the authority of every MS., however ancient,\nwe must in other cases depend either on the testimony of the best MSS. or be\nguided, in fixing on the right reading, by Saya _n_ a and the rules of\ngrammar. I shall therefore, in cases where I cannot consider Professor\nAufrecht's readings as authoritative improvements, have to give my reasons why\nI adhere to the readings which I had originally adopted.\n\nIn V, 9, 4, I had printed by mistake puru yo instead of puru\xc2\xb4 yo. I had,\nhowever, corrected this misprint in my edition of the Prati _s_ akhya, 393,\n532. Professor Aufrecht decides in favour of puru with a short u, but against\nthe authority of the MSS., S 1, S 2, S 3, which have puru\xc2\xb4.\n\np. lviii\n\nIt was certainly a great mistake of mine, though it may seem more excusable in\na Romanised transcript, that I did not follow the writers of the best MSS. in\ntheir use of the Avagraha, or, I should rather say, of that sign which, as far\nas the Veda is concerned, is very wrongly designated by the name of Avagraha.\nAvagraha, according to the Prati _s_ akhya, never occurs in the Sa _m_ hita\ntext, but is the name given to that halt, stoppage, or pause which in the Pada\ntext separates the component parts of compound words. That pause has the\nlength of one short vowel, i. e. one matra. Of course, nothing is said by the\nPrati _s_ akhya as to how the pause should be represented graphically, but it\nis several times alluded to as of importance in the recitation and\naccentuation of the Veda. What we have been in the habit of calling Avagraha\nis by the writers of certain MSS. of the Sa _m_ hita text used as the sign of\nthe Viv _ri_ tti or hiatus. This hiatus, however, is very different from the\nAvagraha, for while the Avagraha has the length of one matra, the Viv _ri_ tti\nor hiatus has the length of \xc2\xbc matra, if the two vowels are short; of \xc2\xbd matra,\nif either vowel is long; of \xc2\xbe matra, if both vowels are long. Now I have\nseveral times called attention to the fact that though this hiatus is marked\nin certain MSS. by the sign \xe0\xa4\xbd, I have in my edition omitted it, because I\nthought that the hiatus spoke for itself and did not require a sign to attract\nthe attention of European readers; while, on the contrary, I have inserted\nthat sign where MSS. hardly ever use it, viz. when a short initial a is elided\nafter a final e or o; (see my remarks on pp. 36, 39. of my edition of the\nPrati _s_ akhya.) Although I thought, and still think, that this use of the\nsign . is more useful for practical purposes, yet I regret that, in this one\nparticular, I should have deviated from the authority of the best MSS., and\ncaused some misunderstandings on the part of those who have made use of my\nedition. If, for instance, I had placed the sign of the Viv _ri_ tti, the \xe0\xa4\xbd,\nin its proper place, or if, at least, I had not inserted it where, as we say.\nThe initial a has been elided after e or o, Professor Bollensen would have\nseen at once that the authors of the Prati _s_ akhyas fully agree with him in\nlooking on this change, not as an\n\np. lix\n\nelision, but as a contraction. If, as sometimes happens, final o or e remain\nunchanged before initial short a, this is called the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ala and Pra\n_k_ ya padav _ri_ tti (Sutra 137). If, on the contrary, final o or e become\none (ekibhavati) with the initial short a, this is called the Abhinihita\nsandhi (Sutra 138). While the former, the hiatus of the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ala and\nEastern schools, is marked by the writers of several MSS. by the sign \xe0\xa4\xbd, the\nAbhinihita sandhi, being a sandhi, is not marked by any sign a.\n\nI, 3, 12. ra\xc2\xb4 _g_ ati (Aufr. p. 2) instead of ra _g_ ati (M. M. vol. i, p. 75)\nis wrong.\n\nI, 7, 9. ya eka _h_ (Aufr. p. 5) should be ya. eka _h_ (M. M. vol. i, p. 110),\nbecause the relative pronoun is never without an accent. The relative particle\nyatha may be without an accent, if it stands at the end of a pada; and though\nthere are exceptions to this rule, yet in VIII, 21, 5, where Professor\nAufrecht gives yatha, the MSS. are unanimous in favour of yatha (M. M. vol.\niv, p. 480). See Phi _t_ -sutra, ed. Kielhorn, p. 54.\n\nI, 10, 11. a tu\xc2\xb4 (Aufr. p. 7) should be a\xc2\xb4 tu\xc2\xb4 (M. M. vol. i, p. 139), because\na is never without the accent.\n\nI, 10, 12. _g_ ush _t_ a _h_ , which Professor Aufrecht specially mentions as\nhaving no final Visarga in the Pada, has the Visarga in all the MSS., (Aufr.\np. 7, M. M. vol. i. p. 140.)\n\nI, 11, 4. kavir (Aufr. p. 7) should be kavir (M. M. vol. i, p. 143).\n\nI, 22, 8, read ra\xc2\xb4dha _m_ si.\n\nI, 40, 1 and 6. There is no excuse for the accent either on tvemahe or on vo\n_k_ ema, while sa _k_ an\xcc\x90 in I, 51, 11, ought to have the accent on the first\nsyllable.\n\nI, 49, 3. Rosen was right in not eliding the a in divo antebhya _h_. S 1, S 2,\n_S_ 3 preserve the initial a, nor does the Prati _s_ akhya anywhere provide\nfor its suppression.\n\nI, 54, 8. kshatram (Aufr. p. 46) is a mere misprint for kshatram.\n\np. lx\n\nI, 55, 7. vandana _s_ rud (Aufr. p. 47) instead of vandana _s_ rud (M. M. vol.\ni, p. 514) is wrong.\n\nI, 57, 2. sama\xc2\xb4 _s_ ita instead of sama _s_ ita had been corrected in my\nreprint of the first Ma _n_ _d_ ala, published at Leipzig. See Bollensen,\nZeitschrift der D. M. G., vol. xxii, p. 626.\n\nI, 61, 7, read vish _n_ u _h_ ; I, 64, 2, read _s_ u _k_ aya _h_ ; I, 64, 5,\nread dhu\xc2\xb4taya _h_.\n\nI, 61, 16. Rosen had rightly printed hariyo _g_ ana with a long a both in the\nSa _m_ hita and Pada texts, and I ought not to have given the short a instead.\nAll the MSS., S 1, S 2, S 3, P 1, and P 2, give the long a. Professor Aufrecht\ngives the short a in the Pada, which is wrong.\n\nI, 67, 2 (4). vidantim (M. M. vol. i, p. 595) is perfectly right, as far as\nthe authority of the MSS. and of Saya _n_ a is concerned, and should not have\nbeen altered to vindantim (Aufr. p. 57).\n\nI, 72, 2, read vatsam; I, 72, 6, read pasu\xc2\xb4\xc3\xb1; I, 76, 3, read dhakshy; I, 82,\n1, read yada\xc2\xb4.\n\nI, 83, 3. Rosen was right in giving asa _m_ yatta _h_. I gave asa _m_ yata _h_\non the authority of P 1, but all the other MSS. have tt.\n\nI, 84, 1. indra (Aufr. p. 68) cannot have the accent on the first syllable,\nbecause it does not stand at the beginning of a pada (M. M. vol. i, p. 677).\nThe same applies to indra, VI, 41, 4, (Aufr. pt 429) instead of indra (M. M.\nvol. iii, p. 734); to agne, I, 140, 12, (Aufr. p. 130) instead of agne (M. M.\nvol. ii, p. 133). In III, 36, 3, on the contrary, indra, being at the head of\na pada, ought to have the accent on the first syllable, indra (M. M. vol. ii,\np. 855), not indra (Aufr. p. 249). The same mistake occurs again, III, 36, 10\n(Aufr. p. 250); IV, 32, 7, (Aufr. p. 305); IV, 32, 12, (Aufr. p. 305); VIII,\n3, 12, (Aufr. vol. ii, p. 86). In V, 61, 1, nara _h_ should have no accent;\nwhereas in VII, 91, 3, it should have the accent on the first syllable. In\nVIII, 8, 19, vipanyu should have no accent, and Professor Aufrecht gives it\ncorrectly in the notes, where he has likewise very properly removed the\nAvagraha which I had inserted.\n\nI, 88, 1, read yata (M. M. vol. i, p. 708), not yatha (Aufr. p. 72).\n\np. lxi\n\nI, 90, 1, read _ri_ _g_ uniti\xc2\xb4; I, 94, 11, read yavasa\xc2\xb4do (M. M. vol. i, p.\n766), not yavasa\xc2\xb4do (Aufr. p. 80).\n\nI, 118, 9. abhibhu\xc2\xb4tim (Aufr. p. 105) instead of abhibhutim (M. M. vol. i, p.\n957) cannot be right, considering that in all other passages abhibhuti has the\naccent on the second syllable. S 1, S 2, S 3 have the accent on the i.\n\nI, 128, 4. gh _ri_ ta _s_ rir (Aufr. p. 117) instead of gh _ri_ ta _s_ ri\xc2\xb4r\n(M. M. vol. ii, p. 52) is wrong.\n\nI, 144, 2, read pariv _ri_ ta _h_ (M. M. vol. ii, p. 155) instead of pari\xc2\xb4v\n_ri_ ta _h_ (Aufr. p. 133).\n\nI, 145, 5. Professor Aufrecht (p. 134) gives upamasya\xc2\xb4m, both in the Sa _m_\nhita and Pada texts, as having the accent on the last syllable. I had placed\nthe accent on the penultimate, (Pada, upa-masyam, vol. ii, p. 161,) and\nwhatever may be the reading of other MSS., this is the only possible\naccentuation. S 1, S 2, S 3 have the right accent.\n\nI, 148, 4. puru\xc2\xb4 _n_ i (Aufr. p. 136) instead of puru\xc2\xb4 _n_ i (M. M. vol. ii,\np. 170) does not rest, as far as I know, on the authority of any MSS. S 1, S\n2, S 3 have puru\xc2\xb4 _n_ i.\n\nI, 151, 7. ga _k_ _kh_ atho (Aufr. p. 137) should be ga _k_ _kh_ atho (M. M.\nvol. ii, p. 181).\n\nI, 161, 12. All the Pada MSS. read pra abravit, separating the two words and\naccentuating each. Though the accent is irregular, yet, considering the\npeculiar construction of the verse, in which pra and pro are used as adverbs\nrather than as prepositions, I should not venture with Professor Aufrecht (p.\n144) to write pra abravit. The MSS. likewise have a\xc2\xb4 a _g_ agan, I, 161, 4;\nand pra aga _h_ , VIII, 48, 2, not pra aga _h_ , as Aufrecht gives in his\nsecond edition.\n\nI, 163, 11. dhra _g_ iman (Aufr. p. 147) instead of dhra _g_ i _m_ an (M. M.\nvol. ii, p. 245) is wrong.\n\nI, 163, 13. gamya (Aufr. p. 148) instead of gamya\xc2\xb4 (M. M. vol. ii, p. 246) is\nwrong.\n\nI, 164, 17, read pare _n_ a (M. M. vol. ii, p. 259) instead of pare _n_ a\n(Aufr. p. 149).\n\nI, 164, 38. The first _k_ ikyu _h_ ought to have the accent, and has it in all\nthe MSS., (Aufr. p. 151, M. M. vol. ii, p. 278.)\n\nI, 165, 5. A mere change of accent may seem a small\n\np. lxii\n\nmatter, yet it is frequently of the highest importance in the interpretation\nof the Veda. Thus in I, 165, 5, I had, in accordance with the MSS. S 1, S 2, S\n3, printed etan (vol. ii, p. 293) with the accent on the first syllable.\nProfessor Aufrecht alters this into eta\xc2\xb4n (p. 153), which, no doubt, would be\nthe right form, if it were intended for the accusative plural of the pronoun,\nbut not if it is meant, as it is here, for the accusative plural of eta, the\nspeckled deer of the Maruts.\n\nI, 165, 15. yasish _t_ a (Aufr. p. 154) instead of yasish _t_ a (M. M. vol.\nii, p. 298) is not supported by any MS.\n\nI, 169, 7, instead of patayanta (Aufr. p. 158), read patayanta (M. M. vol. ii,\np. 322).\n\nI, 174, 7. kuyava _k_ am (Aufr. p. 162) should be kuyava _k_ am (M. M. vol.\nii, p. 340).\n\nI, 177, 1. yukta\xc2\xb4, which I had adopted from MS. S 3 (prima manu), is not\nsupported by other MSS., though P 2 reads yuttka\xc2\xb4. Professor Aufrecht, who had\nretained yukta\xc2\xb4 in the text, has afterwards corrected it to yuktva\xc2\xb4, and in\nthis he was right. In I, 177, 2, gahi for yahi is wrong.\n\nI, 188, 4. astri _n_ an (Aufr. p. 171) instead of ast _ri_ _n_ an (M. M. vol.\nii, p. 395) can only be a misprint.\n\nII, 29, 6. kartad (Aufr. p. 203) instead of karta\xc2\xb4d (M. M. vol. ii, p. 560) is\nwrong.\n\nII, 40, 4. _k_ akra (Aufr. p. 214) instead of _k_ akra (M. M. vol. ii, p. 614)\nis wrong.\n\nIII, 7, 7. gu _h_ (Aufr. p. 226) instead of gu _h_ (M. M. vol. ii, p. 666) is\nwrong; likewise III, 30, 10, ga _h_ (Aufr. p. 241) instead of ga\xc2\xb4 _h_ (M. M.\nvol. ii, p. 792).\n\nIII, 17, 1. i _g_ yate (Aufr. p. 232) instead of a _g_ yate (M. M. vol. ii, p.\n722) is impossible.\n\nIII, 47, 1. Professor Aufrecht (p. 256) puts the nominative indro instead of\nthe vocative indra, which I had given (vol. ii, p. 902). I doubt whether any\nMSS. support that change (S 1, S 2, S 3 have indra), but it is clear that Saya\n_n_ a takes indra as a vocative, and likewise the Nirukta.\n\nIII, 50, 2. Professor Aufrecht (p. 258) gives asya, both in the Sa _m_ hita\nand Pada, without the accent on the last syllable. But all the MSS. that I\nknow (S 1, S 2, S 3, P 1,\n\np. lxiii\n\n[paragraph continues] P 2) give it with the accent on the last syllable (M. M.\nvol. ii, p. 912), and this no doubt is right. The same mistake occurs again in\nIII, 51, 10, (Aufr. p. 259); IV, 5, 11, (Aufr. p. 281); IV, 36, 2, (Aufr. p.\n309); V, 12, 3, (Aufr. p. 337); while in VIII, 103, 9, (Aufr. vol. ii, p. 195)\nthe MSS. consistently give asya as unaccented, whereas Professor Aufrecht, in\nthis very passage, places the accent on the last syllable. On the same page\n(p. 259) amandan, in the Pada, is a misprint for amandan.\n\nIII, 53, 18. asi (Aufr. p. 262) instead of asi (M. M. vol. ii, p. 934) is\nwrong, because hi requires that the accent should remain on asi. S 1, S 2, S\n3, P 1, P 2 have asi.\n\nIV, 4, 7. sva a\xc2\xb4yushe (Aufr. p. 279) instead of sva a\xc2\xb4yushi (M. M. vol. iii,\np. 37) is not supported by any good MSS., nor required by the sense of the\npassage. S 1, S 2, S 3, P 1, P 2 have a\xc2\xb4yushi.\n\nIV, 5, 7. arupitam, in the Pada, (Aufr. p. 280) instead of a\xc2\xb4rupitam (M. M.\nvol. iii, p. 45) is right, as had been shown in the Prati _s_ akhya, Sutra\n179, though by a misprint the long a of the Sa _m_ hita had been put in the\nplace of the short a of the Pada.\n\nIV, 5, 9. read gau _h_ (M. M. vol. iii, p. 46) instead of go _h_ (Aufr. p.\n281).\n\nIV, 15, 2. ya\xc2\xb4ti, with the accent on the first syllable, is supported by all\nMSS. against yati (Aufr. p. 287). The same applies to ya\xc2\xb4ti in IV, 29, 2, and\nto varante in IV, 31, 9.\n\nIV, 18, 11. ami, without any accent (Aufr. p. 293), instead of ami\xc2\xb4 (M. M.\nvol. iii, p. 105) is wrong, because ami\xc2\xb4 is never unaccented.\n\nIV, 21, 9. no, without an accent (Aufr. p. 296), instead of no (M. M. vol.\niii, p. 120) is wrong.\n\nIV, 26, 3. atithigvam (Aufr. p. 300) instead of atithigvam (M. M. vol. iii, p.\n140) and VI, 47, 22, atithigvasya (Aufr. p. 437) instead of atithigvasya (M.\nM. vol. iii, p. 776) are wrong, far atithigva never occurs again except with\nthe accent on the last syllable. The MSS. do not vary. Nor do they vary in the\naccentuation of kutsa: hence kutsam (Aufr. p. 300) should be kutsam (M. M.\nvol. iii p. 139).\n\np. xliv\n\nIV, 36, 6. Professor Aufrecht (p. 309) has altered the accent of a\xc2\xb4vishu _h_\ninto avishu _h_ , but the MSS. are unanimous in favour of a\xc2\xb4vishu _h_ (M. M.\nvol. iii, p. 181).\n\nAgain in IV, 41, 9, the MSS. support the accentuation of agman (M. M. vol.\niii, p. 200), while Professor Aufrecht (p. 313) has altered it to agman.\n\nIV, 42, 9. ada _s_ at, being preceded by hi, ought to have the accent;\n(Aufrecht, p. 314, has ada _s_ at without the accent.) For the same reason, V,\n29, 3, avindat (M. M. vol. iii, p. 342) ought not to have been altered to\navindat (Aufr. p. 344).\n\nIV, 50, 4. vyoman is a misprint for vyoman.\n\nV, 15, 5. Professor Aufrecht (p. 338) writes dirgham instead of dogham (M. M.\nvol. iii, p. 314). This, no doubt, was done intentionally, and not by\naccident, as we see from the change of accent. But dogham, though it occurs\nbut once, is supported in this place by all the best MSS., and has been\naccepted by Professor Roth in his Dictionary.\n\nV, 34, 4. prayato (Aufr. p. 351) instead of prayata (M. M. vol. iii, p. 371)\nis wrong.\n\nV, 42, 9. visarma _n_ am (Aufr. p. 358) instead of visarma\xc2\xb4 _n_ am (M. M. vol.\niii, p. 402) is wrong.\n\nV, 44, 4. parva _n_ e (Aufr. p. 360) instead of prava _n_ e (M. M. vol. iii,\np. 415) is wrong.\n\nV, 83, 4. vanti (Aufr. p. 389) instead of va\xc2\xb4nti (M. M. vol. iii, p. 554) is\nsupported by no MSS.\n\nV, 85, 6. asi _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ anti _h_ (Aufr. p. 391) instead of asi _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ anti _h_\n(M. M. vol. iii, p. 560) is not supported either by MSS. or by grammar, as si\n_\xc3\xb1_ _k_ belongs to the Tud-class. On the same grounds ishayanta _h_ , VI, 16,\n27 (M. M. vol. iii, p. 638), ought not to have been changed to ishayanta _h_\n(Aufr. p. 408), nor VI, 24, 7, avakar _s_ ayanti (Ni. M. vol. iii, p. 687)\ninto avakar _s_ ayanti (Aufr. p. 418).\n\nVI,. 46, 10, read girva _n_ as (M. M. vol. iii, p. 763) instead of girva _n_\nas (Aufr. p. 435).\n\nVI, 60, 10. k _ri_ _n_ oti (Aufr. p. 450) instead of k _ri_ _n_ oti (M. M.\nvol. iii, p. 839) is wrong.\n\nVII, 40, 4. aryama\xc2\xb4 a\xc2\xb4pa _h_ (Aufr. vol. ii, p. 35), in the Pada instead of\naryama\xc2\xb4 apa _h_ (M. M. vol. iv, p. 81) is wrong.\n\np. lxv\n\nVII, 51, 1. adityana\xc2\xb4m (Aufr. vol. ii, p. 40) instead of aditya\xc2\xb4nam (M. M.\nvol. iv, p. 103) is wrong.\n\nVII, 64, 2. i _l_ a\xc2\xb4m (Aufr. vol. ii, p. 50) instead of i _l_ am (M. M. vol.\niv, p. 146) is wrong. In the same verse gopa _h_ in the Pada should be changed\nin my edition to gopa.\n\nVII, 66, 5. yo (Aufr. vol. ii, p. 51) instead of ye (M. M. vol. iv, p. 151) is\nindeed supported by S 3, but evidently untenable on account of atipiprati.\n\nVII, 72, 3. In abudhran Professor Aufrecht has properly altered the wrong\nspelling abudhnan; and, as far as the authority of the best MSS. is concerned\n(S 1, S 2, S 3), he is also right in putting a final n, although Professor\nBollensen prefers the dental n; (Zeitschrift der D. M. G., vol. xxii, p. 599.)\nThe fact is that Vedic MSS. use the Anusvara dot for final nasals before all\nclass-letters, and leave it to us to interpret that dot according to the\nletter which follows. Before I felt quite certain on this point, I have in\nseveral cases retained the dot, as given by the MSS., instead of changing it,\nas I ought to have done according to my system of writing\n[Devanagari](errata.htm#0), into the corresponding nasal, provided it\nrepresents an original n. In I, 71, 1, S 2, S 3 have the dot in a _g_ ushran,\nbut S 1 has dental n. In IX, 87, 5, as _ri_ gran has the dot; i. e. S 1 has\nthe dot, and n _kh_ , dental n joined to _kh_ ; S 2 has n _kh_ without the dot\nbefore the n; S 3 has the dot, and then _kh_. In IV, 24, 6, the spelling of\nthe Sa _m_ hita avivena _m_ tam would leave it doubtful whether we ought to\nread avivenan tam or avivenam tam; S 1 and S 3 read avivena _m_ ta _m_ , but S\n2 has avivenan tam; P 2 has avi-venan ta _m_ , and P 1 had the same\noriginally, though a later hand changed it to avi-vena _m_ ta _m_. In IV, 25,\n3, on the contrary, S 1 and S 3 write avivena _m_ ; S 2, avivenam; P i and P\n2, avi-vena _m_. What is intended is clear enough, viz. avi-venan in IV, 24,\n6; avi-venam in IV, 25, 3. [In the new edition avivenam has been left in both\npassages.]\n\nVII, 73 1. a _s_ vina (Aufr. vol. ii, p. 56) instead of a _s_ vina (M. M. vol.\niv, p. 176) is wrong. On the same page, dhish _n_ ye, VII, 72, 3, should have\nthe accent on the first syllable.\n\nVII, 77, 1. In this verse, which has been so often discussed\n\np. lxvi\n\n[paragraph continues] (see Kuhn, Beitrage, vol. iii, p. 472; Bohtlingk and\nRoth, Dictionary, vol. ii, p. 968; Bollensen, Orient und Occident, vol. ii, p.\n463), all the MSS. which I know, read _k_ ara\xc2\xb4yai, and not either _k_ ara\xc2\xb4thai\nnor _g_ ara\xc2\xb4yai.\n\nVIII, 2, 29. kiri _n_ am (Aufr. vol. ii, p. 84) instead of kari _n_ am (M. M.\nvol. iv, p. 308) does not rest on the authority of any MSS., nor is it\nsupported by Saya _n_ a.\n\nVIII, 9, 9. Professor Aufrecht has altered the very important form a _k_ u _k_\nyuvimahi (M. M. vol. iv, p. 389) to a _k_ u _k_ yavimahi (vol. ii, p. 98). The\nquestion is whether this was done intentionally and on the authority of any\nMSS. My own MSS. support the form a _k_ ukyuvimahi, and I see that Professor\nRoth accepts this form.\n\nVIII, 32, 14. ayantaram (Aufr. vol. ii, p. 129) instead of ayanta\xc2\xb4ram (M. M.\nvol. iv, p. 567) is wrong.\n\nVIII, 47, 15. dushvapnyam (Aufr. vol. ii, p. 151) is not so correct as du _h_\nshvapnyam (M. M. vol. iv, p. 660), or, better, dushshvapnyam (Prati _s_ akhya,\nSutras 255 and 364), though it is perfectly true that the MSS. write\ndushvapnyam.\n\n[I ought to state that all these errata have been corrected by Professor\nAufrecht in his second edition.]\n\nIn the ninth and tenth Ma _n_ _d_ alas I have not to defend myself, and I need\nnot therefore give a list of the passages where I think that Professor\nAufrecht's text is not supported by the best MSS. My own edition of these Ma\n_n_ _d_ alas will soon be published, and I need hardly say that where it\ndiffers from Professor Aufrecht's text, I am prepared to show that I had the\nbest authorities on my side.\n\nProfessor Aufrecht writes in the second edition of his Romanised text of the\nRig-veda (p. iv): 'Um den Herren, My own mistakes.die diese Druckfehler in\nmajorem gloriam suam mit so grosser Schonung hervorgehoben haben, einen\nGegendienst zu erweisen, bemerke ich einige derselben.' Dieser Gegendienst, so\ngut er gemeint war, ist leider nicht sehr bedeutend ausgefallen, auch nicht\nimmer in majorem gloriam Catonis.\n\nIn I, 161, 2, Professor Aufrecht objects to _k_ aturas k _ri_ notana. I felt\ndoubtful about it, and in the commentary I printed _k_ atura _h_ k _ri_ _n_\notana. In IV, 33, 5, the reading\n\np. lxvii\n\n_k_ atus kara is sanctioned by the authority of the Prati _s_ akhya, Sutra\n281, 4.\n\nIn I, 181, 5, Aufrecht prefers mathra; Saya _n_ a, Bohtlingk and Roth, and I\nprefer mathna.\n\nIn II, II, 10, he has discovered that _g_ urvit was meant for _g_ urvat.\nWhitney still quotes _g_ urvit.\n\nIn III, 9, 4, he has discovered that apsu should be \xe0\xa4\xbdpsu; but this had been\nalready corrected.\n\nIn III, 25, 2, the final a of vaha ought to be long in the Sa _m_ hita.\n\nIn IV, 19, 4, instead of d _ri_ _lh_ a ni read d _ri_ _lh_ ani.\n\nIn VII, 33, 2, instead of av _ri_ _n_ ita read \xe0\xa4\xbdv _ri_ _n_ ita.\n\nIn VII, 35, 13, the Visarga in devagopa _h_ should be deleted.\n\nIn VII, 42, 2, the Anusvara in yu _m_ kshva should be deleted.\n\nIn VIII, 2, 30, the anudattatara should be shifted from the ultimate to the\npenultimate, dadhire, not dadhire.\n\nIn VIII, 51, 3, avishyanta was meant for arishyantam.\n\nIn VIII, 55, 5, for na read a. The MSS. vary in both cases.\n\nIn IX, 108, 7, in vanakraksha, the kra was printed as _ri_. Professor Aufrecht\nmight have seen it correctly printed in the index. Saya _n_ a read vana _ri_\nksha.\n\nIn X, 28, 11, Professor Aufrecht thinks that the Pada should have godha _h_\ninstead of godha. I think godha is right, in spite of Professor Aufrecht's\nappeal to the silence of the Prati _s_ akhya. The fact is that godha _h_ never\noccurs, while godha occurs in the preceding verse, and again VIII, 69, 9.\n\nAfter such a flourish of trumpets, we expected more from Professor Aufrecht;\nstill we must learn to be grateful even for small mercies.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[lvii:a](sbe3207.htm#fr_37) In the same verse, I, 138, 4, the shu in o shu tva\nshould not be lengthened, for there is no rule, as far as I can see, in the\nPrati _s_ akhya that would require the lengthening of su before tva.
