Those who glance forth like wives and yoke-fellows\n[1](sbe3222.htm#an_1:85:1:1), the powerful sons of Rudra on their way, they,\nthe Maruts, have indeed made heaven and earth to grow\n[2](sbe3222.htm#an_1:85:1:2); they, the strong and wild, delight in the\nsacrifices.\n\n2\\. When grown up [1](sbe3222.htm#an_1:85:2:1), they attained to greatness;\nthe Rudras have established their seat in the sky. While singing their song\nand increasing their vigour, the sons of P _ri_ _s_ ni have clothed themselves\nin beauty [2](sbe3222.htm#an_1:85:2:2).\n\n3\\. When these sons of the cow (P _ri_ _s_ ni) [1](sbe3222.htm#an_1:85:3:1)\nadorn themselves with glittering ornaments, the brilliant\n[2](sbe3222.htm#an_1:85:3:2) ones put bright weapons on their bodies\n[3](sbe3222.htm#an_1:85:3:3). They drive away every adversary\n[4](sbe3222.htm#an_1:85:3:4); fatness (rain) streams along their paths;--\n\n4\\. When you [1](sbe3222.htm#an_1:85:4:1), the powerful, who shine with your\nspears, shaking even what is unshakable by strength,--when you, O Maruts, the\nmanly hosts [2](sbe3222.htm#an_1:85:4:2), had yoked the spotted deer, swift as\nthought, to your chariots;--\n\n5\\. When you had yoked the spotted deer before your chariots, hurling\n[1](sbe3222.htm#an_1:85:5:1) the stone (thunderbolt) in the fight, then the\nstreams of the red-(horse) [2](sbe3222.htm#an_1:85:5:2) rush forth: like a\nskin [3](sbe3222.htm#an_1:85:5:3) with water they water the earth.\n\n6\\. May the swiftly-gliding, swift-winged horses carry you hither! Come forth\nwith your arms [1](sbe3222.htm#an_1:85:6:1)! Sit down on the grass-pile; a\nwide seat has been made for you. Rejoice, O Maruts, in the sweet food\n[2](sbe3222.htm#an_1:85:6:2).\n\np. 127\n\n7\\. Strong in themselves, they grew [1](sbe3222.htm#an_1:85:7:1) with might;\nthey stepped to the firmament, they made their seat wide. When Vish _n_ u\n[2](sbe3222.htm#an_1:85:7:2) saved the enrapturing Soma, the Maruts sat down\nlike birds on their beloved altar.\n\n8\\. Like [1](sbe3222.htm#an_1:85:8:1) heroes indeed thirsting for fight they\nrush about; like combatants eager for glory they have striven in battles. All\nbeings are afraid of the Maruts; they are men terrible to behold, like kings.\n\n9\\. When the clever Tvash _t_ ar [1](sbe3222.htm#an_1:85:9:1) had turned the\nwell-made, golden, thousand-edged thunderbolt, Indra takes it to perform his\nmanly deeds [2](sbe3222.htm#an_1:85:9:2); he slew V _ri_ tra, he forced out\nthe stream of water.\n\n10\\. By their power they pushed the well [1](sbe3222.htm#an_1:85:10:1) aloft,\nthey clove asunder the rock (cloud), however strong. Blowing forth their voice\n[2](sbe3222.htm#an_1:85:10:2) the bounteous Maruts performed, while drunk of\nSoma, their glorious deeds.\n\n11\\. They pushed the well (cloud) athwart this way, they poured out the spring\nto the thirsty Gotama. The Maruts with beautiful splendour approach him with\nhelp, they in their own ways satisfied the desire of the sage.\n\n12\\. The shelters which you have for him who praises you, grant them threefold\n[1](sbe3222.htm#an_1:85:12:1) to the man who gives! Extend the same to us, O\nMaruts! Give us, ye heroes [2](sbe3222.htm#an_1:85:12:2), wealth with valiant\noffspring!\n\np. 128\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThis hymn is ascribed to Gotama. No verse of this hymn occurs in SV., VS.;\nverse 6 = AV. XX, 13, 2; verse 7 = TS. IV, 1, 11, 3; verse 12 = TS. I, 5, 11,\n5; TB. II, 8, 5, 6.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. The phrase _g_ anaya _h_ na saptaya _h_ is obscure. As _g_ ani has\nalways the meaning of wife, and sapti in the singular, dual, and plural means\nhorse, it might be supposed that _g_ anaya _h_ could be connected with saptaya\n_h_ , so as to signify mares. But although _g_ ani is coupled with patni, I,\n62, 10, in the sense of mother-wife, and though sapti is most commonly joined\nwith some other name for horse, yet _g_ anaya _h_ saptaya _h_ never occurs,\nfor the simple reason that it would be too elaborate and almost absurd an\nexpression for va _d_ ava _h_. We find sapti joined with va _g_ in, I, 162, 1;\nwith rathya, II, 31, 7; atyam na saptim, III, 22, 1; sapti hari, III, 35, 2; a\n_s_ va sapti-iva, VI, 59, 3.\n\nWe might then suppose the thought of the poet to have been this: What appears\nbefore us like race-horses, viz. the storms coursing through the sky, that is\nreally the host of the Maruts. But then _g_ anaya _h_ remains unexplained, and\nit is impossible to take _g_ anaya _h_ na saptaya _h_ as two similes, like\nunto horses, like unto wives.\n\nI believe, therefore, that we must here take sapti in its original\netymological sense, which would be ju-mentum, a yoked animal, a beast of\ndraught, or rather a follower, a horse that will follow. Sapti, therefore,\ncould never be a wild horse, but always a tamed horse, a horse that will go in\nharness. Cf. IX, 21, 4. hita\xc2\xb4 _h_ na saptaya _h_ rathe, like horses put to the\nchariot; or in the singular, IX, 70, 10. hita _h_ na sapti _h_ , like a\nharnessed horse. The root is sap, which in the Veda means to follow, to attend\non, to worship. But if sapti means originally animals that will go\n\np. 129\n\ntogether, it may in our passage have retained the sense of yoke-fellow\n(\xcf\x83\xe1\xbd\xbb\xce\xb6\xcf\x85\xce\xb3\xce\xbf\xcf\x82), and be intended as an adjective to _g_ anaya _h_ , wives. There is\nat least one other passage where this meaning would seem to be more\nappropriate,. viz.\n\nVIII, 20, 23. yuyam sakhaya _h_ saptaya _h_.\n\nYou (Maruts), friends and followers! or you, friends and comrades!\n\nHere it is hardly possible to assign to sapti the sense of horse, for the\nMaruts, though likened to horses, are never thus barely invoked as saptaya\n_h_!\n\nIf then we translate, \'Those who glance forth like wives and yoke-fellows,\' i.\ne. like wives of the same husband, the question still recurs how the simile\nholds good, and how the Maruts rushing forth together in all their beauty can\nbe compared to wives. In answer to this we have to bear in mind that the idea\nof many wives belonging to one husband (sapatni) is familiar to the Vedic\npoet, and that their impetuously rushing into the arms of their husbands, and\nappearing before them in all their beauty, are frequent images in their\npoetry. In such phrases as patim na _g_ anaya _h_ and _g_ anaya _h_ na\ngarbham, the _g_ anis, the wives or mothers, are represented as running\ntogether after their husbands or children. This impetuous approach the poet\nmay have wished to allude to in our passage also, but though it might have\nbeen understood at once by his hearers, it is almost impossible to convey this\nimplied idea in any other language.\n\nWilson translates: \'The Maruts, who are going forth, decorate themselves like\nfemales: they are gliders (through the air), the sons of Rudra, and the doers\nof good works, by which they promote the welfare of earth and heaven. Heroes,\nwho grind (the solid rocks), they delight in sacrifices.\'\n\nLudwig translates: \'Die ganz besonders sich schmucken wie frauen, die renner,\nzu ihrem zuge,\' &c. This is possible, yet the simile sounds somewhat forced.\n\nNote 2. The meaning of this phrase, which occurs very frequently, was\noriginally that the storms by driving away the dark clouds, made the earth and\nthe sky to appear\n\np. 130\n\nlarger and wider. It afterwards takes a more general sense of increasing,\nstrengthening, blessing.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Ukshita is here a participle of vaksh or uksh, to grow, to wax; not of\nuksh, to sprinkle, to anoint, to inaugurate, as explained by Saya _n_ a. Thus\nit is said of the Maruts, V, 55, 3. sakam _g_ ata\xc2\xb4 _h_ --sakam ukshita\xc2\xb4 _h_ ,\nborn together, and grown up together.\n\nNote 2. The same expression occurs VIII, 28, 5. sapto (iti) adhi _s_ riya _h_\ndhire. See also I, 116, 17; IX, 68, 1.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Go-mat _ri_ , like go- _g_ ata, a name of the Maruts, who are also\ncalled p _r i_ _s_ ni-matara _h_ , sindhu-matara _h_.\n\nNote 2. _S_ ubhra is applied to the Maruts, I, i9, 5. Otherwise, no doubt, it\nmight refer, as Ludwig remarks, to virukmata _h_ , always supposing that\nvirukmat is a feminine. Whether tanushu _s_ ubhrah can stand for tanushu _s_\nubhrasu is more doubtful.\n\nNote 3. Virukmata _h_ must be an accusative plural. It occurs I, 127, 3, as an\nepithet of o _g_ as; VI, 49, 5, as an epithet of the chariot of the A _s_\nvins. In our place, however, it must be taken as a substantive, signifying\nsomething which the Maruts wear, probably armour or weapons. This follows\nchiefly from X, 138, 4. _s_ atrun a _s_ _ri_ _n_ at virukmata, Indra tore his\nenemies with the bright weapon. In VIII, 20, 11, where rukma occurs as a\nmasculine plural, vi bhra _g_ ante rukma\xc2\xb4sa _h_ adhi bahushu, their bright\nthings shine on their arms, it seems likewise to be meant for weapons;\naccording to Saya _n_ a, for chains. In V, 55, 3; X, 78, 3, the Maruts are\ncalled vi-roki _n_ a _h_ , bright like the rays of the sun or the tongues of\nfire.\n\nNote 4. Observe the short syllable in the tenth syllable of this Pada; Benfey,\nVedica, p. 124; Lanman, Noun-Inflection, pp. 378, 543.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. The sudden transition from the third to the second person is not\nunusual in the Vedic hymns, the fact\n\np. 131\n\nbeing that where we in a relative sentence should use the same person as that\nof the principal verb, the Vedic poets frequently use the third.\n\nNote 2. V _r i_sha-vrata is untranslatable for reasons stated p. 138 seq.; it\nmeans consisting of companies of v _r i_shans, in whatever sense that word be\ntaken. Wilson in his translation mistakes a _k_ yuta for a _k_ yuta _h_ , and\nvrata for vrata. He translates the former by \'incapable of being overthrown,\'\nthe latter by \'entrusted with the duty of sending rain,\' both against the\nauthority of Saya _n_ a. V _r i_shavra\xcc\x86ta occurs twice in the Rig-veda as an\nepithet of Soma only, IX, 62, 11; 64, 1.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. If we take adri for cloud, then ra _m_ h might have the meaning of\nstirring up.\n\nV, 32, 2. tvam utsan _ri_ tu-bhi _h_ badbadhana\xc2\xb4n ara _m_ ha _h_.\n\nThou madest the springs to run that had been shut up by the seasons.\n\nVIII, 19, 6. tasya it arvanta _h_ ra _m_ hayante a _s_ ava _h_. His horses\nonly run quick.\n\nBut adri often means stone, in the sense of weapon, or bolt (cf. adriva _h_ ,\nvoc., wielder of the thunderbolt), and ra _m_ hayati would then have the\nmeaning of hurling. This is the meaning adopted by Benfey and Ludwig.\n\nNote 2. The red may be the dark red cloud, but arusha has almost become a\nproper name, and its original meaning of redness is forgotten. Nay, it is\npossible that arusha, as applied to the same power of darkness which is best\nknown by the names of V _ri_ tra, Dasyu, &c., may never have had the sense of\nredness, but been formed straight from ar, to hurt, from which arvan, arus,\n&c. (see [p. 65](sbe3218.htm#page_65) seq.). It would then mean simply the\nhurter, the enemy. It is possible also to take arusha in the sense of the red\nhorse, the leader between the two Haris, when we ought to remember that the\nMaruts pour forth the streams of the stallion, RV. V, 83, 6. pra pinvata v _r\ni_sh _n_ a _h_ a _s_ vasya dha\xc2\xb4ra _h_ , and that they lead about the horse to\nmake it rain, RV. I, 64, 6. atyam na mihe vi nayanti va _g_ inam.\n\np. 132\n\nNote 3. Saya _n_ a explains: \'They moisten the whole earth like a hide,\' a\nhide representing a small surface which is watered without great effort.\nWilson: \'They moisten the earth, like a hide, with water.\' Langlois: \'Alors\nles gouttes d\'eau, per\xc3\xa7ant comme la peau de ce (nuage) bienfaisant viennent\ninonder la terre.\' Benfey: \'Dann stu\xc2\xb4rzen reichlich aus der rothen\n(Gewitterwolke) Tropfen, mit Fluth wie eine Haut die Erde netzend. (Dass die\nErde so durchnasst wird, wie durchregnetes Leder.)\' If the poet had intended\nto compare the earth, before it is moistened by rain, to a hide, he might have\nhad in his mind the dryness of a tanned skin, or, as Professor Benfey says, of\nleather. If, on the contrary, the simile refers to the streams of water, then\n_k_ arma-iva, like a skin, might either be taken in the technical acceptation\nof the skin through which, at the preparation of the Soma, the streams (dhara\n_h_ ) of that beverage are squeezed and distilled, or we may take the word in\nthe more general sense of water-skin. In that case the comparison, though not\nvery pointedly expressed, as it would have been by later Sanskrit poets, would\nstill be complete. The streams of the red-(horse), i. e. of the cloud, rush\nforth, and they, whether the streams liberated by the Maruts, or the Maruts\nthemselves, moisten the earth with water, like a skin, i. e. like a skin in\nwhich water is kept and from which it is poured out. The cloud itself being\ncalled a skin by Vedic poets (I, 129, 3) makes the comparison still more\nnatural.\n\nOne other explanation might suggest itself, if the singular of karma should be\nconsidered objectionable on account of the plural of the verb. Vedic poets\nspeak of the skin of the earth. Thus:\n\nX, 68, 4. bhu\xc2\xb4mya _h_ udna\xc2\xb4-iva vi tva _k_ am bibheda.\n\nHe (B _ri_ haspati) having driven the cows from the cave, cut the skin of the\nearth, as it were, with water, i. e. saturated it with rain.\n\nThe construction, however, if we took _k_ arma in the sense of surface, would\nbe very irregular, and we should have to translate: They moisten the earth\nwith water like a skin, i. e. skin-deep.\n\np. 133\n\nWe ought to scan ka\xcc\x84rme\xcc\x84\xcc\x81vo\xcc\x84da\xcc\x86\xcc\x81bhi\xcc\x84 _h_ vi\xcc\x86\xcc\x81 u\xcc\x84nda\xcc\x84\xcc\x81nti\xcc\x86 bhu\xcc\x84\xcc\x81ma\xcc\x84 for _k_\na\xcc\x84rme\xcc\x84va\xcc\x86 u\xcc\x86da\xcc\x86bhi\xcc\x84 _h_ vyu\xcc\x84nda\xcc\x84nti\xcc\x86 bhu\xcc\x84ma\xcc\x84 would give an unusual caesura.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. AV. XX, 13, 2. With your arms, i. e. according to Saya _n_ a, with\narmfuls of gifts. Though this expression does not occur again so baldly, we\nread I, 166, 10, of the Maruts, that there are many gifts in their strong\narms, bhuri _n_ i bhadra\xc2\xb4 naryeshu bahushu; nor does bahu, as used in the\nplural, as far as I am able to judge, ever convey any meaning but that of\narms. The idea that the Maruts are carried along by their arms as by wings,\ndoes not rest on Vedic authority, otherwise we might join raghupatvana _h_\nwith bahubhi _h_ , come forth swiftly flying on your arms! As it is, and with\nthe accent on the antepenultimate, we must refer raghupatvana _h_ to saptaya\n_h_ , horses.\n\nNote 2. The sweet food is Soma.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. The initial \'a\' of avardhanta must be elided, or \'te a\' be pronounced\nas two _s_ hort syllables equal to one long.\n\nNote 2. Taitt. S. IV, I, 11, 3. Vish _n_ u, whose character in the hymns of\nthe Veda is very different from that assumed by him in later periods of Hindu\nreligion, must here be taken as the friend and companion of Indra. Like the\nMaruts, he assisted Indra in his battle against V _ri_ tra and the conquest of\nthe clouds. When Indra was forsaken by all the gods, Vish _n_ u came to his\nhelp.\n\nIV, 18, 11. uta mata\xc2\xb4 mahisham anu avenat ami\xc2\xb4 (iti) tva _g_ ahati putra deva\xc2\xb4\n_h_ ,\n\natha abravit v _ri_ tram indra _h_ hanishyan sakhe vish _n_ o (iti) vi-taram\nvi kramasva.\n\nThe mother also called after the bull, these gods forsake thee, O son; then,\nwhen going to kill V _ri_ tra, Indra said, Friend, Vish _n_ u, step forward!\n\nThis stepping of Vish _n_ u is emblematic of the rising, the culminating, and\nsetting of the sun; and in VIII, 12, 27,\n\np. 134\n\n[paragraph continues] Vish _n_ u is said to perform it through the power of\nIndra. In VI, 20, 2, Indra is said to have killed V _ri_ tra, assisted by Vish\n_n_ u (vish _n_ una sa _k_ ana _h_ ). Vish _n_ u is therefore invoked together\nwith Indra, VI, 69, 8; VII, 99; with the Maruts, V, 87; VII, 36, 9. In VII,\n93, 8, Indra, Vish _n_ u, and the Maruts are called upon together. Nay,\nma\xc2\xb4ruta, belonging ta the Maruts, becomes actually an epithet of Vish _n_ u,\nV, 46, 2. ma\xc2\xb4ruta uta vish _n_ o (iti); and in I, 156, 4. ma\xc2\xb4rutasya vedhasa\n_h_ has been pointed out by Roth as an appellation of Vish _n_ u. The mention\nof Vish _n_ u in our hymn is therefore by no means exceptional, but the whole\npurport of this verse is nevertheless very doubtful, chiefly owing to the fact\nthat several of the words occurring in it lend themselves to different\ninterpretations.\n\nThe translations of Wilson, Benfey, and others have not rendered the sense\nwhich the poet intends to describe at all clear. Wilson says: \'May they for\nwhom Vish _n_ u defends (the sacrifice), that bestows all desires and confers\ndelight, come (quickly) like birds, and sit down upon the pleasant and sacred\ngrass.\' Benfey: \'Wenn Vish _n_ u schutzt den rauschtriefenden tropfenden\n(Soma), sitzen wie Vogel sie auf der geliebten Streu.\' Langlois: \'Quand Vich\n_n_ ou vient prendre sa part de nos enivrantes libations, eux, comme des\noiseaux, arrivent aussi sur le cousa qui leur est cher.\' Ludwig: \'Als Vish _n_\nu half dem zum rauschtrank eilenden stiere, setzten sie sich wie vogel aufs\nliebe barhis.\'\n\nWhence all these varieties? First, because a\xc2\xb4vat may mean, he defended or\nprotected, but likewise, it is supposed, he descried, became aware. Secondly,\nbecause v _r i_shan is one of the most vague and hence most difficult words in\nthe Veda, and may mean Indra, Soma, or the cloud: (see the note on V _r\ni_shan, p. 138.) Thirdly, because the adjective belonging to v _r i_shan,\nwhich generally helps us to determine which v _r i_shan is meant, is here\nitself of doubtful import, and certainly applicable to Indra as well as to\nSoma and the A _s_ vins, possibly even to the cloud. Mada- _k_ yut is readily\nexplained by the commentators as bringing down pride, a meaning which the word\nmight well have in modern Sanskrit, but which it clearly has not in\n\np. 135\n\nthe Veda. Even where the thunderbolt of Indra is called mada _k_ yut, and\nwhere the meaning of \'bringing down pride\' would seem most appropriate, we\nought to translate \'wildly rushing down.\'\n\nVIII, 96, 5. a\xc2\xb4 yat va _g_ ram bahvo _h_ indra dhatse mada _k_ yutam ahaye\nhantavai u _m_ (iti).\n\nWhen thou tookest the wildly rushing thunderbolt in thy arms in order to slay\nAhi.\n\nWhen applied to the gods, the meaning of mada _k_ yut is by no means certain.\nIt might mean rushing about fiercely, reeling with delight, this delight being\nproduced by the Soma, but it may also mean sending down delight, i. e. rain or\nSoma. The root _k_ yu is particularly applicable to the sending down of rain;\ncf. Taitt. Sa _m_ h. II, 4, 9, 2; 10, 3; III, 3, 4, 1; and Indra and his\nhorses, to whom this epithet is chiefly applied, are frequently asked to send\ndown rain. However, mada _k_ yut is also applied to real horses (I, 126, 4)\nwhere givers of rain would be an inappropriate epithet. I should therefore\ntranslate mada _k_ yut, when applied to Indra, to his horses, to the A _s_\nvins, or to horses in general by furiously or wildly moving about, as if \'made\nor madena _k_ yavate,\' he moves in a state of delight, or in a state of\nintoxication, such as was not incompatible with the character of the ancient\ngods. Here again the difficulty of rendering Vedic thought in English, or any\nother modern language, becomes apparent, for we have no poetical word to\nexpress a high state of mental excitement produced by drinking the\nintoxicating juice of the Soma or other plants, which has not something\nopprobrious mixed up with it, while in ancient times that state of excitement\nwas celebrated as a blessing of the gods, as not unworthy of the gods\nthemselves, nay, as a state in which both the warrior and the poet would\nperform their highest achievements. The German R a u sc h is the nearest\napproach to the Sanskrit mada.\n\nVIII, I, 21. vi _s_ vesham taruta\xc2\xb4ram mada- _k_ yutam made hi sma dadati na\n_h_.\n\nIndra, the conqueror of all, who rushes about in rapture, for in rapture he\nbestows gifts upon us. Cf. I, 51, 2.\n\np. 136\n\nThe horses of Indra are called mada _k_ yut, I, 81, 3; VIII, 33, 18; 34, 9.\nOrdinary horses, I, 126, 4.\n\nIt is more surprising to see this epithet applied to the A _s_ vins, who are\ngenerally represented as moving about with exemplary steadiness. However we\nread:\n\nVIII, 22, 16. mana _h_ - _g_ avasa v _ri_ sha _n_ a mada- _k_ yuta.\n\nYe two A _s_ vins, quick as thought, powerful, wildly moving; or, as Saya _n_\na proposes, liberal givers, humblers of your enemies. See also VIII, 35, 19.\n\nMost frequently mada _k_ yut is applied to Soma, X, 30, 9; IX, 32, 1; 53, 4;\n79, 2; 108, 11; where particularly the last passage deserves attention, in\nwhich Soma is called mada _k_ yutam sahasra-dharam v _ri_ shabham.\n\nLastly, even the wealth itself which the Maruts are asked to send down from\nheaven, most likely rain, is called, VIII, 7, 13, rayim mada- _k_ yutam puru-\nkshum vi _s_ vadhayasam.\n\nIn all these passages we must translate mada- _k_ yut by bringing delight,\nshowering down delight.\n\nWe have thus arrived at the conclusion that v _r i_sha _n_ am mada- _k_ yutam,\nas used in our passage I, 85, 7, might be meant either for Indra or for Soma.\nIf the A _s_ vins can be called v _r i_sha _n_ au mada- _k_ yuta, the same\nexpression would be even more applicable to Indra. On the other hand, if Soma\nis called v _ri_ shabha _h_ mada-kyut, the same Soma may legitimately be\ncalled v _r i_sha inada- _k_ yut. In deciding whether Indra or Soma be meant,\nwe must now have recourse to other hymns, in which the relations of the Maruts\nwith Vish _n_ u, Soma, and Indra are alluded to.\n\nIf Indra were intended, and if the first words meant \'When Vish _n_ u\nperceived the approach of Indra,\' we should expect, not that the Maruts sat\ndown on the sacrificial pile, but that they rushed to the battle. The idea\nthat the Maruts come to the sacrifice, like birds, is common enough:\n\nVIII, 20, 10. v _ri_ shana _s_ vena maruta _h_ v _r i_sha-psuna rathena v _r\ni_sha-nabhina, a\xc2\xb4 _s_ yena\xc2\xb4sa _h_ na pakshi _n_ a _h_ v _r i_tha nara _h_\nhavya\xc2\xb4 na _h_ vitaye gata.\n\nCome ye Maruts together, to eat our offerings, on your\n\np. 137\n\nstrong-horsed, strong-shaped, strong-naved chariot, like winged hawks!\n\nBut when the Maruts thus come to a sacrifice it is to participate in it, and\nparticularly in the Soma that is offered by the sacrificer. This Soma, it is\nsaid in other hymns, was prepared by Vish _n_ u for Indra (II, 22, 1), and\nVish _n_ u is said to have brought the Soma for Indra (X, 113, 2). If we keep\nthese and similar passages in mind. and consider that in the preceding verse\nthe Maruts have been invited to sit down on the sacrificial pile and to\nrejoice in the sweet food, we shall see that the same train of thought is\ncarried on in our verse, the only new idea being that the saving or, possibly,\nthe descrying of the Soma is ascribed to Vish _n_ u. See, however, Bergaigne,\nJourn. Asiat. 1884, p 472.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. On na and iva together, see Bollensen, Orient and Occident, II, 470.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. Tvash _t_ ar, the workman of the gods, frequently. also the fashioner\nand creator.\n\nNote 2. Nari, the loc. sing. of n _ri_ , but, if so, with a wrong accent,\noccurs only in this phrase as used here, and as repeated in VIII, 96, 19. nari\napa _m_ si karta sa _h_ v _ri_ traha\xc2\xb4. Its meaning is not clear. It can hardly\nmean \'on man,\' without some more definite application. If n _ri_ could be used\nas a name of V _ri_ tra or any other enemy, it would mean, to do his deeds\nagainst the man, on the enemy. N _ri_ , however, is ordinarily an honorific\nterm, chiefly applied to Indra, IV, 25, 4. nare naryaya n _r i_-tamaya n _ri_\n_n_ a\xc2\xb4m, and hence its application to V _ri_ tra would be objectionable. Saya\n_n_ a explains it in the sense of battle. I believe that nari stands for\nnarya, the acc. plur. neut. of narya, manly, and the frequent epithet of apas,\nand I have translated accordingly. Indra is called narya-apas, VIII, 93, 1.\nSee also Kuhn\'s Zeitschrift, vol. xxv, p. 601.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. Avata, a well, here meant for cloud, like utsa, I, 64, 6.\n\np. 138\n\nNote 2. Dhamanta _h_ va _n_ am is translated by Saya _n_ a as playing on the\nlyre, by Benfey as blowing the flute. Such a rendering, particularly the\nlatter, would be very appropriate, but there is no authority for va _n_ a\nmeaning either lyre or flute in the Veda. Va _n_ a occurs five times only. In\none passage, VIII, 20, 8. gobhi _h_ va _n_ a _h_ a _g_ yate, it means arrow;\nthe arrow is sent forth from the bow-strings. The same meaning seems\napplicable to IX, 50, I. va _n_ asya _k_ odaya pavim. In another passage, IX,\n97, 8. pra vadanti va _n_ am, they send forth their voice, is applied to the\nMaruts, as in our passage; in IV, 24, 9, the sense is doubtful, but here too\nva _n_ a clearly does not mean a musical instrument. See III, 30, 10. Spiegel\ncompares the Huzvaresh and Armenian vang (Pers. banig), voice. M. Senart\n(Journal Asiatique, 1874, p. 281) is in favour of taking va _n_ a for flute.\n\n##### Verse 12.\n\nNote 1. In the Taitt. S. I, 5, 11, we have _s_ a _s_ amanaya, and in the\nTaitt. Br. II, 8, 5, 6, _s_ am _s_ amanaya, but Saya _n_ a explains _s_ a _s_\namanaya, _s_ a _m_ _s_ ana _m_ kurvate. He explains tridhatuni by a _s_ anam,\npanam, khadanam.\n\nV _r i_shan.\n\nNote 2. In v _r i_shan we have one of those words which it is almost\nimpossible to translate accurately. It occurs over and over again in the Vedic\nhymns, and if we once know the various ideas which it either expresses or\nimplies, we have little difficulty in understanding its import in a vague and\ngeneral way, though we look in vain for corresponding terms in any modern\nlanguage. In the Veda, and in ancient languages generally, one and the same\nword is frequently made to do service for many. Words retain their general\nmeaning,--though at the same time they are evidently used with a definite\npurpose. This is not only a peculiar phase of language, but a peculiar phase\nof thought, and as to us this phase has become strange and unreal, it is very\ndifficult to transport ourselves back into it, still more to translate the\npregnant terms of the Vedic poets into the definite languages which we have to\nuse. Let us imagine a state of\n\np. 139\n\nthought and speech in which virtus still meant manliness, though it might also\nbe applied to the virtue of a woman; or let us try to speak and think a\nlanguage which expressed the bright and the divine, the brilliant and the\nbeautiful, the straight and the right, the bull and the hero, the shepherd and\nthe king by the same terms, and we shall see how difficult it would be to\ntranslate such terms without losing either the key-note that was still\nsounding, or the harmonics which were set vibrating by it in the minds of the\npoets and their listeners.\n\n1\\. V _r i_shan, male.\n\nV _r i_shan, being derived from a root v _ri_ sh, spargere, meant no doubt\noriginally the male, whether applied to animals or men. In this sense v _r\ni_shan occurs frequently in the Veda, either as determining the sex of the\nanimal which is mentioned, or as standing by itself and meaning the male. In\neither case, however, it implies the idea of strength and eminence, which we\nlose whether we translate it by man or male.\n\nThus a _s_ va is horse, but VII, 69, 1, we read:\n\na\xc2\xb4 vam ratha _h_ --v _r i_sha-bhi _h_ yatu a _s_ vai _h_.\n\nMay your chariot come near with powerful horses, i. e. with stallions.\n\nThe Haris, the horses of Indra, are frequently called v _r i_sha _n_ a\n\nI, 177, 1. yuktva\xc2\xb4 hari (iti) v _r i_sha _n_ a.\n\nHaving yoked the bay stallions.\n\nV _ri_ shaba, though itself originally meaning the male animal, had become\nfixed as the name of the bull, and in this process it had lost so much of its\netymological import that the Vedic poet did not hesitate to define v _ri_\nshabha itself by the addition of v _r i_shan. Thus we find:\n\nVIII, 93, 7. sa _h_ v _r i_sha v _ri_ shabha _h_ bhuvat.\n\nMay he (Indra) be a strong bull.\n\nI, 54, 2. v _r i_sha v _ri_ sha-tva\xc2\xb4 v _ri_ shabha _h_.\n\nIndra by his strength a strong bull; but, literally, Indra by his manliness a\nmale bull.\n\nEven v _ri_ shabha loses again its definite meaning; and as\n\np. 140\n\nbull in bull-calf means simply male, or in bull-trout, large, so v _ri_ shabha\nis added to atya, horse, to convey the meaning of large or powerful:\n\nI, 177, 2. ye te v _r i_sha _n_ a _h_ v _ri_ shabha\xc2\xb4sa _h_ indra--atya _h_.\nThy strong and powerful horses; literally, thy male bull-horses.\n\nWhen v _r i_shan and v _ri_ shabha are used as adjectives, for instance with\n_s_ ushma, strength, they hardly differ in meaning:\n\nVI, 19, 8. a\xc2\xb4 na _h_ bhara v _r i_sha _n_ am _s_ ushmam indra.\n\nBring us thy manly strength, O Indra.\n\nAnd in the next verse:\n\nVI, 19, 9. a\xc2\xb4 te _s_ ushma _h_ v _ri_ shabha _h_ etu.\n\nMay thy manly strength come near.\n\nVa _m_ saga, too, which is clearly the name for bull, is defined by v _r\ni_shan, I, 7, 8:\n\nv _r i_sha yutha\xc2\xb4-iva va _m_ saga _h_.\n\nAs the strong bull scares the herds.\n\nThe same applies to vara\xc2\xb4ha, which, though by itself meaning boar, is\ndetermined again by v _r i_shan:\n\nX, 67, 7. v _r i_sha-bhi _h_ vara\xc2\xb4hai _h_.\n\nWith strong boars.\n\nIn III, 2, 11, we read:\n\nv _r i_sha--na\xc2\xb4nadat na si _m_ ha _h_.\n\nLike a roaring lion.\n\nIf used by itself, v _r i_shan, at least in the Rig-veda, can hardly be said\nto be the name of any special animal, though in later Sanskrit it may mean\nbull or horse. Thus if we read, X, 43, 8, v _r i_sha na kruddha _h_ , we can\nonly translate like an angry male, though, no doubt, like a wild bull, would\nseem more appropriate.\n\nI, 186, 5. yena napatam apa\xc2\xb4m _g_ una\xc2\xb4ma mana _h_ - _g_ uva _h_ v _r i_sha _n_\na _h_ yam vahanti.\n\nThat we may excite the son of the water (Agni), whom the males, quick as\nthought, carry along.\n\nHere the males are no doubt the horses or stallions of Agni. But, though this\nfollows from the context, it would be wrong to say that v _r i_shan by itself\nmeans horse.\n\np. 141\n\nIf used by itself, v _r i_shan most frequently means man, and chiefly in his\nsexual character. Thus:\n\nI, 140, 6. v _r i_sha-iva patni _h_ abhi eti roruvat.\n\nAgni comes roaring like a husband to his wives.\n\nI, 179, i. api u _m_ (iti) nu patni _h_ v _r i_sha _n_ a _h_ _g_ agamyu _h_.\n\nWill the husbands now come to their wives?\n\nII, 16, 8. sak _r i_t su te sumati-bhi _h_ --sam patnibhi _h_ na v _r i_sha\n_n_ a _h_ nasimahi.\n\nMay we for once cling firmly to thy blessings, as husbands cling to their\nwives.\n\nV, 47, 6. upa-prakshe v _r i_sha _n_ a _h_ modamana _h_ diva _h_ patha\xc2\xb4\nvadhva\xcc\x83 _h_ yanti a _k_ _kh_ a.\n\nThe exulting men come for the embrace on the path of heaven towards their\nwives.\n\nIn one or two passages v _r i_shan would seem to have a still more definite\nmeaning, particularly in the formula su\xc2\xb4ra _h_ d _r i_ _s_ ike v _r i_sha _n_\na _h_ _k_ a pau _m_ sye, which occurs IV, 41, 6; X, 92, 7. See also I, 179, 1.\n\nIn all the passages which we have hitherto examined v _r i_shan clearly\nretained its etymological meaning, though even then it was not always possible\nto translate it by mal e.\n\nThe same meaning has been retained in other languages in which this word can\nbe traced. Thus, in Zend, arshan (the later gushan) is used to express the sex\nof animals in such expressions as a _s_ pahe arshno, gen. a male horse;\nvarazahe arshno, gen. a male boar; geus arshno, gen. a male ox; but likewise\nin the sense of man or hero, as arsha hu _s_ rava, the hero Hu _s_ rava. In\nGreek we find \xe1\xbc\x84\xcf\x81\xcf\x83\xce\xb7\xce\xbd and \xe1\xbc\x84\xe1\xbf\xa4\xe1\xbf\xa5\xce\xb7\xce\xbd used in the same way to distinguish the sex of\nanimals, as \xe1\xbc\x84\xcf\x81\xcf\x83\xce\xb5\xce\xbd\xce\xb5\xcf\x82 \xe1\xbc\xb5\xcf\x80\xcf\x80\xce\xbf\xce\xb9, \xce\xb2\xce\xbf\xe1\xbf\xa6\xce\xbd \xe1\xbc\x84\xcf\x81\xcf\x83\xce\xb5\xce\xbd\xce\xb1. In Latin the same word may be\nrecognised in the proper name Varro, and in varo and baro.\n\nWe now come to another class of passages in which v _r i_shan is clearly\nintended to express more than merely the masculine gender. In some of them the\netymological meaning of spargere, to pour forth, seems to come out again, and\nit is well known that Indian commentators are very fond of explaining v _r\ni_shan by giver of rain, giver of\n\np. 142\n\ngood gifts, bounteous. The first of these meanings may indeed be admitted in\ncertain passages, but in others it is more than doubtful.\n\nII. V _r i_shan, fertilising.\n\nI, 181, 8. v _r i_sha vam megha _h_ may be translated, your raining cloud.\n\nI, 129, 3. dasma _h_ hi sma v _r i_sha _n_ am pinvasi tva _k_ am.\n\nThou art strong, thou fillest the rainy skin, i. e. the cloud.\n\nSee also IV, 22, 6; and possibly V, 83, 6.\n\nIt may be that, when applied to Soma too, v _r i_shan retained something of\nits etymological meaning, that it meant gushing forth, poured out, though in\nmany places it is impossible to render v _r i_shan, as applied to Soma, by\nanything but strong. All we can admit is that v _r i_shan, if translated by\nstrong, means also strengthening and invigorating, an idea not entirely absent\neven in our expression, a strong drink.\n\nIII. V _r i_shan, strong.\n\nI, 80, 2. sa _h_ tva amadat v _r i_sha mada _h_ , soma _h_ --suta _h_.\n\nThis strong draught inspirited thee, the poured out Soma-juice.\n\nI, 91, 2. tvam v _r i_sha v _ri_ sha-tvebhi _h_.\n\nThou, Soma, art strong by strength.\n\nI, 175, 1. v _r i_sha te v _r i_sh _n_ e indu _h_ va _g_ i\xc2\xb4 sahasra-sa\xc2\xb4tama\n_h_.\n\nFor thee, the strong one, there is strong drink, powerful, omnipotent.\n\nIn the ninth Ma _n_ _d_ ala, specially dedicated to the praises of Soma, the\ninspiriting beverage of gods and men, the repetition of v _r i_shan, as\napplied to the juice and to the god who drinks it, is constant. Indo v _r\ni_sha or v _r i_sha indo are incessant invocations, and become at last\nperfectly meaningless.\n\nIV. V _r i_shan, epitheton ornans.\n\nThere can be no doubt, in fact, that already in the hymns of the Veda, v _r\ni_shan had dwindled away to a mere epitheton ornans, and that in order to\nunderstand it correctly, we must, as much as possible, forget its etymological\n\np. 143\n\ncolouring, and render it by hero or strong. Indra, Agni, the A _s_ vins, Vish\n_n_ u, the _Ri_ bhus (IV, 35, 6), all are v _r i_shan, which means no longer\nmale, but manly, strong.\n\nIn the following passages v _r i_shan is thus applied to Indra:\n\nI, 54, 2. ya _h_ dh _ri_ sh _n_ una _s_ avasa rodasi (iti) ubhe (iti) v _r\ni_sha v _ri_ sha-tva\xc2\xb4 v _ri_ shabha _h_ ni- _ri_ _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ate.\n\n(Praise Indra) who by his daring strength conquers both heaven and earth, a\nbull, strong in strength.\n\nI, 100, 1. sa _h_ ya _h_ v _r i_sha v _r i_sh _n_ yebhi _h_ sam-oka _h_ maha\n_h_ diva _h_ p _ri_ thivya\xc2\xb4 _h_ _k_ a sam-ra\xc2\xb4 _t_ satina-satva havya _h_\nbhareshu marutvan na _h_ bhavatu indra _h_ uti\xc2\xb4.\n\nHe who is strong, wedded to strength, who is the king of the great sky and the\nearth, of mighty might, to be invoked in battles,--may Indra with the Maruts\ncome to our help!\n\nI, 16, 1. a\xc2\xb4 tva vahantu haraya _h_ v _r i_sha _n_ am soma-pitaye, Indra tva\nsu\xc2\xb4ra- _k_ akshasa _h_.\n\nMay the bays bring thee hither, the strong one, to the Soma-draught, may the\nsunny-eyed horses (bring) thee, O Indra!\n\nIV, 16, 20. eva it indraya v _ri_ shabha\xc2\xb4ya v _r i_sh _n_ e brahma akarma bh\n_r i_gava _h_ na ratham.\n\nThus we have made a hymn for Indra, the strong bull, as the Bh _ri_ gus make a\nchariot.\n\nX, 153, 2. tvam v _ri_ shan v _r i_sha it asi.\n\nThou, O hero, art indeed a hero; and not, Thou, O male, art indeed a male;\nstill less, Thou, O bull, art indeed a bull.\n\nI, 101, 1. avasyava _h_ v _r i_sha _n_ am va _g_ ra-dakshi _n_ am marutvantam\nsakhya\xc2\xb4ya havamahe.\n\nLonging for help we call as our friend the hero who wields the thunderbolt,\nwho is accompanied by the Maruts.\n\nVIII, 6, 14. ni _s_ ush _n_ e indra dhar _n_ asim va _g_ ram _g_ aghantha\ndasyavi, v _r i_sha hi ugra _s_ _ri_ _n_ vishe.\n\nThou, O Indra, hast struck the strong thunderbolt against _S_ ush _n_ a, the\nfiend; for, terrible one, thou art called hero!\n\nVIII, 6, 40. vav _ri_ dhana _h_ upa dyavi v _r i_sha va _g_ ri\xc2\xb4 aroravit, v\n_ri_ tra-ha\xc2\xb4 soma-pa\xc2\xb4tama _h_.\n\np. 144\n\nGrowing up by day, the hero with the thunderbolt has roared, the V _ri_ tra-\nkiller, the great Soma-drinker.\n\nV, 35, 4. v _r i_sha hi asi ra\xc2\xb4dhase _g_ a _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ishe v _r i_sh _n_ i te _s_\nava _h_.\n\nThou (Indra) art a hero, thou wast born to be bounteous; in thee, the hero,\nthere is might.\n\nV. Varshish _th_ a, strongest, best, oldest.\n\nIt is curious to watch the last stage of the meaning of v _r i_shan in the\ncomparative and superlative varshiyas and varshish _th_ a. In the Veda,\nvarshish _th_ a still means excellent, but in later Sanskrit it is considered\nas the superlative of v _ri_ ddha, old, so that we see v _r i_shan, from\nmeaning originally manly, vigorous, young, assuming in the end the meaning of\nold. (M. M., Sanskrit Grammar, \xc2\xa7 252.)\n\nYet even thus, when v _r i_shan means simply strong or hero, its sexual sense\nis not always forgotten, and it breaks out, for instance, in such passages as,\n\nI, 32, 7. v _r i_sh _n_ a _h_ vadhri _h_ prati-ma\xc2\xb4nam bubhushan purutra\xc2\xb4 v\n_ri_ tra _h_ a _s_ ayat vi-asta _h_.\n\nV _ri_ tra, the eunuch, trying to be like unto a man (like unto Indra), was\nlying, broken to many pieces.\n\nThe next passages show v _r i_shan as applied to Agni:\n\nIII, 27, 15. v _r i_sha _n_ am tva vayam v _ri_ shan v _r i_sha _n_ a _h_ sam\nidhimahi.\n\nO, strong one, let us the strong ones kindle thee, the strong!\n\nV, I, 12. avo _k_ ama kavaye medhyaya va _k_ a _h_ vanda\xc2\xb4ru v _ri_ shabha\xc2\xb4ya v\n_r i_sh _n_ e.\n\nWe have spoken an adoring speech for the worshipful poet, for the strong bull\n(Agni).\n\nVish _n_ u is called v _r i_shan, I, 154, 3:\n\npra vish _n_ ave _s_ usham etu manma giri-kshite uru-gaya\xc2\xb4ya v _r i_sh _n_ e.\n\nMay this hymn go forth to Vish _n_ u, he who dwells in the mountain"(cloud),\nwho strides wide, the hero!\n\nRudra is called v _r i_shan:\n\nII, 34, 2. rudra _h_ yat va _h_ maruta _h_ rukma-vakshasa _h_ v _r i_sha a _g_\nani p _r i_ _s_ nya _h_ _s_ ukre u\xc2\xb4dhani.\n\nWhen Rudra, the strong man, begat you, O Maruts with\n\np. 145\n\nbright ornaments on your chests, in the bright lap of P _ri_ _s_ ni.\n\nThat the Maruts, the sons of Rudra, are called v _r i_shan, we have seen\nbefore, and shall see frequently again (I, 165, 1; II, 33, 13; VII, 56, 20;\n21; 58, 6). The whole company of the Maruts is called v _r i_sha ga _n_ a _h_\n, the strong or manly host, i. e. the host of the Maruts, without any further\nqualification.\n\nVI. V _r i_shan, name of various deities.\n\nHere lies, indeed, the chief difficulty which is raised by the common use of v\n_r i_shan in the Veda, that when it occurs by itself, it often remains\ndoubtful who is meant by it, Indra, or Soma, or the Maruts, or some other\ndeity. We shall examine a few of these passages, and first some where v _r\ni_shan refers to Indra:\n\nIV, 30, 10. apa usha\xc2\xb4 _h_ anasa _h_ sarat sam-pish _t_ at aha bibhyushi, ni\nyat sim si _s_ nathat v _r i_sha.\n\nUshas went away from her broken chariot, fearing lest the hero should do her\nviolence.\n\nHere v _r i_shan is clearly meant for Indra, who, as we learn from the\npreceding verse, was trying to conquer Ushas, as Apollo did Daphne; and it\nshould be observed that the word itself, by which Indra is here designated, is\nparticularly appropriate to the circumstances.\n\nI, 103, 6. bhu\xc2\xb4ri-karma _n_ e v _ri_ shabha\xc2\xb4ya v _r i_sh _n_ e satya- _s_\nushmaya sunavama somam, ya _h_ a-d _r i_tya paripanthi\xc2\xb4-iva _s_ u\xc2\xb4ra _h_ aya\n_g_ vana _h_ vi-bha _g_ an eti veda _h_.\n\nLet us pour out the Soma for the strong bull, the performer of many exploits,\nwhose strength is true, the hero who, watching like a footpad, comes to us\ndividing the wealth of the infidel.\n\nHere it is clear again from the context that Indra only can be meant.\n\nBut in other passages this is more doubtful:\n\nIII, 61, 7. _ri_ tasya budhne ushasam isha _n_ yan v _r i_sha mahi\xc2\xb4 (iti)\nrodasi (iti) a\xc2\xb4 vive _s_ a.\n\nThe hero in the depth of the heaven, yearning for the dawns, has entered the\ngreat sky and the earth.\n\np. 146\n\nThe hero who yearns for the dawns, is generally Indra; here, however,\nconsidering that Agni is mentioned in the preceding verse, it is more likely\nthat this god, as the light of the morning, may have been meant by the poet.\nThat Agni, too, may be called v _r i_shan, without any other epithet to show\nthat he is meant rather than any other god, is clear from such passages as,\n\nVI, 3, 7. v _r i_sha ruksha _h_ oshadhishu nunot.\n\nHe the wild hero shouted among the plants.\n\nIn VII, 60, 9, v _ri_ sha _n_ au, the dual, is meant for Mitra and Varu _n_ a;\nin the next verse, v _ri_ sha _n_ a _h_ , the plural, must mean the same gods\nand their companions.\n\nThat Soma is called simply v _r i_shan, not only in the ninth Ma _n_ _d_ ala,\nbut elsewhere, too, we see from such passages as,\n\nIII, 43, 7. indra piba v _r i_sha-dhutasya v _r i_sh _n_ a _h_ (a\xc2\xb4 yam te _s_\nyena _h_ u _s_ ate _g_ abha\xc2\xb4ra), yasya made _k_ yavayasi pra, k _ri_ sh _t_ i\xc2\xb4\n_h_ yasya made apa gotra\xc2\xb4 vavartha.\n\nIndra drink of the male (the strong Soma), bruised by the males (the heavy\nstones), inspirited by whom thou makest the people fall down, inspirited by\nwhom thou hast opened the stables.\n\nHere Saya _n_ a, too, sees rightly that \'the male bruised by the males\' is the\nSoma-plant, which, in order to yield the intoxicating juice, has to be bruised\nby stones, which stones are again likened to two males. But unless the words,\nenclosed in brackets, had stood in the text, words which clearly point to\nSoma, I doubt whether Saya _n_ a would have so readily admitted the definite\nmeaning of v _r i_shan as Soma.\n\nI, 109, 3. ma\xc2\xb4 _kh_ edma ra _s_ mi\xc2\xb4n iti na\xc2\xb4dhamana _h_ pit _r i_ _n_ a\xc2\xb4m _s_\nakti\xc2\xb4 _h_ anu-ya _k_ _kh_ amana _h_ , indragni-bhyam kam v _r i_sha _n_ a _h_\nmadanti ta\xc2\xb4 hi adri (iti) dhisha _n_ aya _h_ upa-sthe.\n\nWe pray, let us not break the cords (which, by means of the sacrifices offered\nby each generation of our forefathers, unite us with the gods); we strive\nafter the powers of our fathers. The Somas rejoice for Indra and Agni; for the\ntwo stones are in the lap of the vessel.\n\nFirst, as to the construction, the fact that participles are thus used as\nfinite verbs, and particularly when the subject changes in the next sentence,\nis proved by other passages,\n\np. 147\n\nsuch as II, 11, 4. The sense is that the new generation does not break the\nsacrificial succession, but offers Soma, like their fathers. The Soma-plants\nare ready, and, when pressed by two stones, their juice flows into the Soma-\nvessel. There may be a double entendre in dhisha _n_ aya _h_ upa-sthe, which\nSanskrit scholars will easily perceive.\n\nWhen v _r i_shan is thus used by itself, we must be chiefly guided by the\nadjectives or other indications before we determine on the most plausible\ntranslation. Thus we read:\n\nI, 55, 4. sah it vane namasyu-bhi _h_ va _k_ asyate _k_ a\xc2\xb4ru _g_ aneshu pra-\nbruva _n_ a _h_ indriyam, v _r i_sha _kh_ andu _h_ bhavati haryata _h_ v _r\ni_sha ksheme _n_ a dhenam magha-va yat invati.\n\nIn the first verse the subject may be Indra or Soma: \'He alone is praised by\nworshippers in the forest (or in the wooden vessel), he who shows forth among\nmen his fair power.\' But who is meant to be the subject of the next verse?\nEven Saya _n_ a is doubtful. He translates first: \'The bounteous excites the\nman who wishes to sacrifice; when the sacrificer, the rich, by the protection\nof Indra, stirs up his voice.\' But he allows an optional translation for the\nlast sentences: when the powerful male, Indra, by his enduring mind reaches\nthe praise offered by the sacrificer.\'\n\nAccording to these suggestions, Wilson translated: He (Indra) is the granter\nof their wishes (to those who solicit him); he is the encourager of those who\ndesire to worship (him), when the wealthy offerer of oblations, enjoying his\nprotection, recites his praise.\n\nBenfey: The bull becomes friendly, the bull becomes desirable, when the\nsacrificer kindly advances praise.\n\nLanglois: When the noble Maghavan receives the homage of our hymns, his heart\nis flattered, and he responds to the wishes of his servant by his gifts.\n\nAs far as I know, the adjective _kh_ andu does not occur again, and can\ntherefore give us no hint. But haryata, which is applied to v _r i_shan in our\nverse, is the standing epithet of Soma. It means delicious, and occurs very\nfrequently in the ninth Ma _n_ _d_ ala. It is likewise applied. to Agni,\nPushan, the Haris, the thunderbolt, but wherever\n\np. 148\n\nit occurs our first thought is of Soma. Thus, without quoting from the Soma-Ma\n_n_ _d_ ala, we read, X, 96, 1, haryatam madam, the delicious draught, i. e.\nSoma.\n\nX, 96, 9. pitva\xc2\xb4 madasya haryatasya andhasa _h_ , means having drunk of the\ndraught of the delicious Soma.\n\nVIII, 72, 18. padam haryatasya ni-dhanya\xc2\xb4m, means the place where the\ndelicious Soma resides.\n\nIII, 44, 1. haryata _h_ soma _h_.\n\nDelicious Soma.\n\nII, 21, 1. bhara indraya somam ya _g_ ata\xc2\xb4ya haryatam.\n\nBring delicious Soma for the holy Indra.\n\nI, 130, 2. madaya haryata\xc2\xb4ya te tuvi _h_ -tamaya dha\xc2\xb4yase.\n\nThat thou mayest drink the delicious and most powerful draught, i. e. the\nSoma.\n\nIf, then, we know that v _r i_shan by itself is used in the sense of Soma,\nharyata v _r i_shan can hardly be anything else. Va _k_ asyate also is\npeculiar to _S_ oma in the sense of murmuring, or as it were talking, .and\nnever occurs as a passive. I therefore should prefer to assign the whole verse\nto Soma, and translate: He indeed, when in the wooden vessel, talks with his\nworshippers, proclaiming his fair power among men; the strong Soma is\npleasing, the strong Soma is delicious, when the sacrificer safely brings the\ncow, i. e. the milk to be mixed with the Soma.\n\nThat Indra was thirsting for Soma had been said in the second verse, and he is\nagain called the Soma-drinker in the seventh verse. A verse dedicated to Soma\ntherefore seems to come in quite naturally, though the Anukrama _n_ i does not\nsanction it.\n\nThat the Maruts are called v _r i_shan, without further explanations, will\nappear from the following passages:\n\nI, 85, 12. rayim na _h_ dhatta v _ri_ sha _n_ a _h_ su-vi\xc2\xb4ram.\n\nGive us wealth, ye heroes, consisting of good offspring.\n\nVIII, 96, 14. ishyami va _h_ v _ri_ sha _n_ a _h_ yudhyata a _g_ au.\n\nI wish for you, heroes (Maruts), fight in the race!\n\nIn all the passages which we have hitherto examined, v _r i_shan was always\napplied to living beings, whether animals, men, or gods. But as, in Greek,\n\xe1\xbc\x84\xcf\x81\xcf\x83\xce\xb7\xce\xbd means at last simply strong, and is applied, for instance, to the\n\np. 149\n\ncrash of the sea, \xce\xba\xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xbb\xcf\x80\xce\xbf\xcf\x82 \xe1\xbc\x84\xcf\x81\xcf\x83\xce\xb7\xce\xbd \xcf\x80\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xbd\xcf\x84\xce\xbf\xcf\x85, so in the Veda v _r i_shan is applied\nto the roaring of the storms and similar objects.\n\nV, 87, 5. svana _h_ v _r i_sha.\n\nYour powerful sound (O Maruts).\n\nX, 47, 1. _g_ ag _ri_ bhma te dakshi _n_ am indra hastam vasuyava _h_ vasu-\npate vasunam, vidma hi tva go-patim _s_ ura gonam asmabhyam _k_ itram v _r\ni_sha _n_ am rayim da _h_.\n\nWe have taken thy right hand, O Indra, wishing for treasures, treasurer of\ntreasures, for we know thee, O hero, to be the lord of cattle; give us bright\nand strong wealth.\n\nShould _k_ itra here refer to treasures, and v _r i_shan to cattle?\n\nX, 89, 9. ni amitreshu vadham indra tumram v _r i_shan v _r i_sha _n_ am\narusham _s_ i _s_ ihi.\n\nWhet, O hero, the heavy strong red weapon against the enemies.\n\nThe long a in v _r i_sha _n_ am is certainly startling, but it occurs once\nmore, IX, 34, 3, where there can be no doubt that it is the accusative of v _r\ni_shan. Professor Roth takes v _r i_shan here in the sense of bull (s. v.\ntumra), but he does not translate the whole passage.\n\nIII, 29, 9. k _ri_ _n_ ota dhumam v _r i_sha _n_ am sakhaya _h_.\n\nMake a mighty smoke, O friends!\n\nStrength itself is called v _r i_shan, if I am right in translating the phrase\nv _r i_sha _n_ am _s_ ushmam by manly strength. It occurs,\n\nIV, 24, 7. tasmin dadhat v _r i_sha _n_ am _s_ ushmam indra _h_.\n\nIndra may give to him manly strength.\n\nVI, 19, 8. a\xc2\xb4 na _h_ bhara v _r i_sha _n_ am _s_ ushmam indra.\n\nBring to us, O Indra, manly strength.\n\nVII, 24, 4. asme (iti) dadhat v _r i_sha _n_ am sushmam indra.\n\nGiving to us, O Indra, manly strength.\n\nSee also VI, 19, 9, _s_ ushma _h_ v _ri_ shabha _h_ , used in the same sense.\n\nVII. V _r i_shan, general and empty term of praise.\n\nThis constant play on the word v _r i_shan, which we have observed in the\npassages hitherto examined, and which give by no means a full idea of the real\nfrequency of its\n\np. 150\n\noccurrence in the Veda, has evidently had its influence on the Vedic _Ri_\nshis, who occasionally seem to delight in the most silly and unmeaning\nrepetitions of this word, and its compounds and derivatives. Here no language\ncan supply any adequate translation; for though we may translate words which\nexpress thoughts, it is useless to attempt to render mere idle play with\nwords. I shall give a few instances:\n\nI, 177, 3. a\xc2\xb4 tish _th_ a ratham v _r i_sha _n_ am v _r i_sha te suta _h_ soma\n_h_ pari-sikta madhuni, yuktva\xc2\xb4 v _r i_sha-bhyam v _ri_ shabha kshitina\xc2\xb4m\nhari-bhyam yahi pra-vata upa madrik.\n\nMount the strong car, the strong Soma is poured out for thee, sweets are\nsprinkled round; come down towards us, thou bull of men, with the strong bays,\nhaving yoked them.\n\nBut this is nothing yet compared to other passages, when the poet cannot get\nenough of v _r i_shan and v _ri_ shabha.\n\nII, 16, 6. v _r i_sha te va _g_ ra _h_ uta te v _r i_sha ratha _h_ v _r i_sha\n_n_ a hari (iti) v _ri_ shabha\xc2\xb4 _n_ i a\xc2\xb4yudha, v _r i_sh _n_ a _h_ madasya v\n_ri_ shabha tvam i _s_ ishe indra somasya v _ri_ shabhasya t _ri_ p _n_ uhi.\n\nThy thunderbolt is strong, and thy car is strong, strong are the bays, the\nweapons are powerful, thou, bull, art lord of the strong draught, Indra\nrejoice in the powerful Soma!\n\nV, 36, 5. v _r i_sha tva v _r i_sha _n_ am vardhatu dyau _h_ v _r i_sha v _r\ni_sha-bhyam vahase hari-bhyam, sa _h_ na _h_ v _r i_sha v _r i_sharatha _h_\nsu- _s_ ipra v _r i_sha-krato (iti) v _r i_sha va _g_ rin bhare dha _h_.\n\nMay the strong sky increase thee, the strong; a strong one thou art, carried\nby two strong bays; do thou who art strong, with a strong car, O thou of\nstrong might, strong holder of the thunderbolt, keep us in battle!\n\nV, 40, 2-3. v _r i_sha gra\xc2\xb4va v _r i_sha mada _h_ v _r i_sha soma _h_ ayam\nsuta _h_ , v _r i_shan indra v _r i_sha-bhi _h_ v _ri_ trahan-tama, v _r i_sha\ntva v _r i_sha _n_ am huve.\n\nThe stone is strong, the draught is strong, this Soma that has been poured out\nis strong, O thou strong Indra, who killest V _ri_ tra with the strong ones\n(the Maruts), I, the strong, call thee, the strong.\n\nVIII, 13, 31-33. v _r i_sha ayam indra te ratha _h_ uto (iti) te\n\np. 151\n\nv _r i_sha _n_ a hari (iti), v _r i_sha tvam _s_ ata-krato (iti) v _r i_sha\nhava _h_. v _r i_sha gra\xc2\xb4va v _r i_sha mada _h_ v _r i_sha soma _h_ ayam suta\n_h_ , v _r i_sha ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a _h_ yam invasi v _r i_sha hava _h_. v _r i_sha\ntva v _r i_sha _n_ am huve va _g_ rin _k_ itra\xc2\xb4bhi _h_ uti-bhi _h_ , vavantha\nhi prati-stutim v _r i_sha hava _h_.\n\nThis thy car is strong, O Indra, and thy bays are strong; thou art strong, O\nomnipotent, our call is strong. The stone is strong, the draught is strong,\nthe Soma is strong, which is here poured out; the sacrifice which thou\norderest is strong, our call is strong. I, the strong, call thee, the strong,\nthou holder of the thunderbolt, with manifold blessings; for thou hast desired\nour praise; our call is strong.\n\nThere are other passages of the same kind, but they are too tedious to be here\nrepeated. The commentator, throughout, gives to each v _r i_shan its full\nmeaning either of showering down or bounteous, or male or-bull; but a word\nwhich can thus be used at random has clearly lost its definite power, and\ncannot call forth any definite ideas in the mind of the listener. It cannot be\ndenied that here and there the original meaning of v _r i_shan would be\nappropriate even where the poet is only pouring out a stream of majestic\nsound, but we are not called upon to impart sense to what are verba et\npraeterquam nihil. When we read, I, 122, 3, va\xc2\xb4ta _h_ apa\xc2\xb4m v _ri_ sha _n_\n-van, we are justified, no doubt, in translating, \'the wind who pours forth\nwater;\' and X, 93, 5, apa\xc2\xb4m v _ri_ sha _n_ -vasu (iti) su\xc2\xb4ryama\xc2\xb4sa, means \'Sun\nand Moon, givers of water.\' But even in some passages where v _r i_shan is\nfollowed by the word v _ri_ sh, it is curious to observe that v _ri_ sh is not\nnecessarily used in the sense of raining or pouring forth, but rather in the\nsense of drinking.\n\nVI, 68, 11. indravaru _n_ a madhumat-tamasya v _r i_sh _n_ a _h_ somasya v\n_ri_ sha _n_ a a a\xc2\xb4 v _ri_ shetham.\n\np. 152\n\nIndra and Varu _n_ a, you strong ones, may you drink of the sweetest strong\nSoma.\n\nThat a-v _ri_ sh means to drink or to eat, was known to Saya _n_ a and to the\nauthor of the _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a, who paraphrases a v _ri_ shayadhvam\nby a _s_ nita, eat.\n\nThe same phrase occurs I, 108, 3.\n\nI, 104, 9. uru-vya _k_ a _h_ _g_ a _th_ are a\xc2\xb4 v _ri_ shasva.\n\nThou of vast extent, drink (the Soma) in thy stomach.\n\nThe same phrase occurs X, 96, 13.\n\nVIII, 61, 3. a\xc2\xb4 v _ri_ shasva--sutasya indra andhasa _h_.\n\nDrink, Indra, of the Soma that is poured out.\n\nIn conclusion, a few passages may be pointed out in which v _r i_shan seems to\nbe the proper name of a pious worshipper:\n\nI, 36, 10. yam tva deva\xc2\xb4sa _h_ manave dadhu _h_ iha ya _g_ ish _th_ am havya-\nvahana, yam ka _n_ va _h_ medhya-atithi _h_ dhanasp _r i_tam yam v _r i_sha\nyam upa-stuta _h_.\n\nThee, O Agni, whom the gods placed here for man, the most worthy of worship, O\ncarrier of oblations, thee whom Ka _n_ va, thee whom Medhyatithi placed, as\nthe giver of wealth, thee whom V _ri_ shan placed and Upastuta.\n\nHere the commentator takes V _ri_ shan as Indra, but this would break the\nsymmetry of the sentence. That Upastuta _h_ is here to be taken as a proper\nname, as Upastuta, the son of V _ri_ sh _t_ ihavya, is clear from verse 17:\n\nagni _h_ pra avat mitra\xc2\xb4 uta medhya-atithim agni _h_ sata\xc2\xb4 upastutam.\n\nAgni protected also the two friends, Medhyatithi and Upastuta, in battle.\n\nThe fact is that whenever upastuta has the accent on the last syllable, it is\nintended as a proper name, while, if used as a participle, in the sense of\npraised, it has the accent on the first.\n\np. 153\n\nVIII, 5, 25. yatha _k_ it ka _n_ vam a\xc2\xb4vatam priya-medham upa-stutam.\n\nAs you have protected Ka _n_ va, Priyamedha, Upastuta. Cf. I, 112, 15.\n\nVIII, 103, 8. pra ma _m_ hish _th_ aya gayata--upa-stutasa _h_ agnaye (accent\nof the vocative).\n\nSing, O Upastutas, to the worthiest, to Agni!\n\nX, 115, 9. iti tva agne v _ri_ sh _t_ i-havyasya putra\xc2\xb4 _h_ upastuta\xc2\xb4sa _h_ _r\ni_shaya _h_ avo _k_ an.\n\nBy these names, O Agni, did the sons of V _ri_ sh _t_ ihavya, the Upastutas,\nthe _Ri_ shis, speak to you.\n\nV _ri_ shan occurs once more as a proper name in VI, 16, 14 and 15:\n\ntam u _m_ (iti) tva dadhya\xe1\xb9\x85 _r i_shi _h_ putra _h_ idhe atharva _n_ a _h_ , v\n_ri_ tra-hanam puram-daram.  \ntam u _m_ (iti) tva pathya _h_ v _r i_sha sam idhe dasyuhantamam, dhanam- _g_\nayam ra _n_ e-ra _n_ e.\n\nThee, O Agni, did Dadhya _k_ kindle, the _Ri_ shi, the son of Atharvan, thee\nthe killer of V _ri_ tra, the destroyer of towns;  \nThee, O Agni, did V _ri_ shan Pathya kindle, thee the best killer of enemies,\nthe conqueror of wealth in every battle.\n\nHere the context can leave no doubt that Dadhya _k_ and V _ri_ shan were both\nintended as proper names. Yet as early as the composition of the _S_ atapatha-\nbrahma _n_ a, this was entirely misunderstood. Dadhya _k_ , the son of\nAtharvan, is explained as speech, V _ri_ shan Pathya as mind ( _S_ at. Br. VI,\n3, 3, 4). On this Mahidhara, in his remarks on Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XI, 34,\nimproves still further. For though he allows his personality to Dadhya _k_ ,\nthe son of Atharvan, he says that Pathya comes from pathin, path, and means he\nwho moves on the right path; or it comes from pathas, which means sky, and is\nhere used in the sense of the sky of the heart. He then takes v _ri_ shan as\nmind, and translates the mind of the heart. Such is a small chapter in the\nhistory of the rise and fall of the Indian mind!\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[151:a](sbe3222.htm#fr_104) The dual v _r i_sha _n_ au occurs only when the\nnext word begins with a vowel. Before an initial a, a, i, the au is always\nchanged into av in the Sa _m_ hita (I, 108, 7-12; 116, 21; 117, 19; 153, 2;\n157, 5; 158, 1; 180, 7; VII, 61, 5). Before u the preceding au becomes a in\nthe Sa _m_ hita, but the Pada gives au, in order to show that no Sandhi can\ntake place between the two vowels (VII, 60, 9; p. 152 X, 66, 7). Before\nconsonants the dual always ends in a, both in the Sa _m_ hita and Pada. But\nthere are a few passages where the final a occurs before initial vowels, and\nwhere the two vowels are allowed to form one syllable. In four passages this\nhappens before an initial a (I, 108, 3; VI, 68, 11; I, 177, 1; II, 16, 5).\nOnce, and once only, it happens before u, in VIII, 22, 12.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 86.
