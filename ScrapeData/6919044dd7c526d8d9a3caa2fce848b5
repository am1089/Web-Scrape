OM: Here follows Instruction in Union.\n\nUnion, here as always in the Scriptures of India, means union of the\nindividual soul with the Oversoul; of the personal consciousness with the\nDivine Consciousness, whereby the mortal becomes immortal, and enters the\nEternal. Therefore, salvation is, first, freedom from sin and the sorrow which\ncomes from sin, and then a divine and eternal well-being, wherein the soul\npartakes of the being, the wisdom and glory of God.\n\n### 2\\. Union, spiritual consciousness, is gained through control of the\nversatile psychic nature.\n\nThe goal is the full consciousness of the spiritual man, illumined by the\nDivine Light. Nothing except the obdurate resistance of the psychic nature\nkeeps us back from the goal. The psychical powers are spiritual powers run\nwild, perverted, drawn from their proper channel. Therefore our first task is,\nto regain control of this perverted nature, to chasten, purify and restore the\nmisplaced powers.\n\n### 3\\. Then the Seer comes to consciousness in his proper nature.\n\nEgotism is but the perversion of spiritual being. Ambition is the inversion of\nspiritual power. Passion is the distortion of love. The mortal is the\nlimitation of the immortal. When these false images give place to true, then\nthe spiritual man stands forth luminous, as the sun, when the clouds disperse.\n\n### 4\\. Heretofore the Seer has been enmeshed in the activities of the psychic\nnature.\n\nThe power and life which are the heritage of the spiritual man have been\ncaught and enmeshed in psychical activities. Instead of pure being in the\nDivine, there has been fretful, combative. egotism, its hand against every\nman. Instead of the light of pure vision, there have been restless senses nave\nbeen re and imaginings. Instead of spiritual joy, the undivided joy of pure\nbeing, there has been self-indulgence of body and mind. These are all real\nforces, but distorted from their true nature and goal. They must be\nextricated, like gems from the matrix, like the pith from the reed, steadily,\nwithout destructive violence. Spiritual powers are to be drawn forth from the\npsychic meshes.\n\n### 5\\. The psychic activities are five; they are either subject or not\nsubject to the five hindrances (Book II, 3).\n\nThe psychic nature is built up through the image-making power, the power which\nlies behind and dwells in mind-pictures. These pictures do not remain\nquiescent in the mind; they are kinetic, restless, stimulating to new acts.\nThus the mind-image of an indulgence suggests and invites to a new indulgence;\nthe picture of past joy is framed in regrets or hopes. And there is the\nceaseless play of the desire to know, to penetrate to the essence of things,\nto classify. This, too, busies itself ceaselessly with the mind-images. So\nthat we may classify the activities of the psychic nature thus:\n\n### 6\\. These activities are: Sound intellection, unsound intellection,\npredication, sleep, memory.\n\nWe have here a list of mental and emotional powers; of powers that picture and\nobserve, and of powers that picture and feel. But the power to know and feel\nis spiritual and immortal. What is needed is, not to destroy it, but to raise\nit from the psychical to the spiritual realm.\n\n### 7\\. The elements of sound intellection are: direct observation, inductive\nreason, and trustworthy testimony.\n\nEach of these is a spiritual power, thinly veiled. Direct observation is the\noutermost form of the Soul's pure vision. Inductive reason rests on the great\nprinciples of continuity and correspondence; and these, on the supreme truth\nthat all life is of the One. Trustworthy testimony, the sharing of one soul in\nthe wisdom of another, rests on the ultimate oneness of all souls.\n\n### 8\\. Unsound intellection is false understanding, not resting on a\nperception of the true nature of things.\n\nWhen the object is not truly perceived, when the observation is inaccurate and\nfaulty. thought or reasoning based on that mistaken perception is of necessity\nfalse and unsound.\n\n### 9\\. Predication is carried on through words or thoughts not resting on an\nobject perceived.\n\nThe purpose of this Sutra is, to distinguish between the mental process of\npredication, and observation, induction or testimony. Predication is the\nattribution of a quality or action to a subject, by adding to it a predicate.\nIn the sentence, 'the man is wise,' 'the man' is the subject; 'is wise' is the\npredicate. This may be simply an interplay of thoughts, without the presence\nof the object thought of; or the things thought of may be imaginary or unreal;\nwhile observation, induction and testimony always go back to an object.\n\n### 10\\. Sleep is the psychic condition which rests on mind states, all\nmaterial things being absent.\n\nIn waking life, we have two currents of perception; an outer current of\nphysical things seen and heard and perceived; an inner current of mind-images\nand thoughts. The outer current ceases in sleep; the inner current continues,\nand watching the mind-images float before the field of consciousness, we\n'dream.'\n\nEven when there are no dreams, there is still a certain consciousness in\nsleep, so that, on waking, one says, 'I have slept well,' or 'I have slept\nbadly.'\n\n### 11\\. Memory is holding to mind-images of things perceived, without\nmodifying them.\n\nHere, as before, the mental power is explained in terms of mind-images, which\nare the material of which the psychic world is built, Therefore the sages\nteach that the world of our perception, which is indeed a world of mind-\nimages, is but the wraith or shadow of the real and everlasting world. In this\nsense, memory is but the psychical inversion of the spiritual, ever-present\nvision. That which is ever before the spiritual eye of the Seer needs not to\nbe remembered.\n\n### 12\\. The control of these psychic activities comes through the right use\nof the will, and through ceasing from self-indulgence.\n\nIf these psychical powers and energies, even such evil things as passion and\nhate and fear, are but spiritual powers fallen and perverted, how are we to\nbring about their release and restoration? Two means are presented to us: the\nawakening of the spiritual will, and the purification of mind and thought.\n\n### 13\\. The right use of the will is the steady, effort to stand in spiritual\nbeing.\n\nWe have thought of ourselves, perhaps, as creatures moving upon this earth,\nrather helpless, at the mercy of storm and hunger and our enemies. We are to\nthink of ourselves as immortals, dwelling in the Light, encompassed and\nsustained by spiritual powers. The steady effort to hold this thought will\nawaken dormant and unrealized powers, which will unveil to us the nearness of\nthe Eternal.\n\n### 14\\. This becomes a firm resting-place, when followed long, persistently,\nwith earnestness.\n\nWe must seek spiritual life in conformity with the laws of spiritual life,\nwith earnestness, humility, gentle charity, which is an acknowledgment of the\nOne Soul within us all. Only through obedience to that shared Life, through\nperpetual remembrance of our oneness with all Divine Being, our nothingness\napart from Divine Being, can we enter our inheritance.\n\n### 15\\. Ceasing from self-indulgence is conscious mastery over the thirst for\nsensuous pleasure here or hereafter.\n\nRightly understood, the desire for sensation is the desire of being, the\ndistortion of the soul's eternal life. The lust of sensual stimulus and\nexcitation rests on the longing to feel one's life keenly, to gain the sense\nof being really alive. This sense of true life comes only with the coming of\nthe soul, and the soul comes only in silence, after self-indulgence has been\ncourageously and loyally stilled, through reverence before the coming soul.\n\n### 16\\. The consummation of this is freedom from thirst for any mode of\npsychical activity, through the establishment of the spiritual man.\n\nIn order to gain a true understanding of this teaching, study must be\nsupplemented by devoted practice, faith by works. The reading of the words\nwill not avail. There must be a real effort to stand as the Soul, a real\nceasing from self-indulgence. With this awakening of the spiritual will, and\npurification, will come at once the growth of the spiritual man and our\nawakening consciousness as the spiritual man; and this, attained in even a\nsmall degree, will help us notably in our contest. To him that hath, shall be\ngiven.\n\n### 17\\. Meditation with an object follows these stages: first, exterior\nexamining, then interior judicial action, then joy, then realization of\nindividual being.\n\nIn the practice of meditation, a beginning may be made by fixing the attention\nupon some external object, such as a sacred image or picture, or a part of a\nbook of devotion. In the second stage, one passes from the outer object to an\ninner pondering upon its lessons. The third stage is the inspiration, the\nheightening of the spiritual will, which results from this pondering. The\nfourth stage is the realization of one's spiritual being, as enkindled by this\nmeditation.\n\n### 18\\. After the exercise of the will has stilled the psychic activities,\nmeditation rests only on the fruit of former meditations.\n\nIn virtue of continued practice and effort, the need of an external object on\nwhich to rest the meditation is outgrown. An interior state of spiritual\nconsciousness is reached, which is called 'the cloud of things knowable' (Book\nIV, 29).\n\n### 19\\. Subjective consciousness arising from a natural cause is possessed by\nthose who have laid aside their bodies and been absorbed into subjective\nnature.\n\nThose who have died, entered the paradise between births, are in a condition\nresembling meditation without an external object. But in the fullness of time,\nthe seeds of desire in them will spring up, and they will be born again into\nthis world.\n\n### 20\\. For the others, there is spiritual consciousness, led up to by faith,\nvalour right mindfulness, one-pointedness, perception.\n\nIt is well to keep in mind these steps on the path to illumination: faith,\nvelour, right mindfulness, one-pointedness, perception. Not one can be\ndispensed with; all must be won. First faith; and then from faith, velour;\nfrom valour, right mindfulness; from right mindfulness, a one-pointed\naspiration toward the soul; from this, perception; and finally, full vision as\nthe soul.\n\n### 21\\. Spiritual consciousness is nearest to those of keen, intense will.\n\nThe image used is the swift impetus of the torrent; the kingdom must be taken\nby force. Firm will comes only through effort; effort is inspired by faith.\nThe great secret is this: it is not enough to have intuitions; we must act on\nthem; we must live them.\n\n### 22\\. The will may be weak, or of middle strength, or intense.\n\nTherefore there is a spiritual consciousness higher than this. For those of\nweak will, there is this counsel: to be faithful in obedience, to live the\nlife, and thus to strengthen the will to more perfect obedience. The will is\nnot ours, but God's, and we come into it only through obedience. As we enter\ninto the spirit of God, we are permitted to share the power of God.\n\nHigher than the three stages of the way is the goal, the end of the way.\n\n### 23\\. Or spiritual consciousness may be gained by ardent service of the\nMaster.\n\nIf we think of our lives as tasks laid on us by the Master of Life, if we look\non all duties as parts of that Master's work, entrusted to us, and forming our\nlife-work; then, if we obey, promptly, loyally, sincerely, we shall enter by\ndegrees into the Master's life and share the Master's power. Thus we shall be\ninitiated into the spiritual will.\n\n### 24\\. The Master is the spiritual man, who s free from hindrances, bondage\nto works, and the fruition and seed of works.\n\nThe Soul of the Master, the Lord, is of the same nature as the soul in us; but\nwe still bear the burden of many evils, we are in bondage through our former\nworks, we are under the dominance of sorrow. The Soul of the Master is free\nfrom sin and servitude and sorrow.\n\n### 25\\. In the Master is the perfect seed of Omniscience.\n\nThe Soul of the Master is in essence one with the Oversoul, and therefore\npartaker of the Oversoul's all-wisdom and all-power. All spiritual attainment\nrests on this, and is possible because the soul and the Oversoul are One.\n\n### 26\\. He is the Teacher of all who have gone before, since he is not\nlimited by Time.\n\nFrom the beginning, the Oversoul has been the Teacher of all souls, which, by\ntheir entrance into the Oversoul, by realizing their oneness with the\nOversoul, have inherited the kingdom of the Light. For the Oversoul is before\nTime, and Time, father of all else, is one of His children.\n\n### 27\\. His word is OM.\n\nOM: the symbol of the Three in One, the three worlds in the Soul; the three\ntimes, past, present, future, in Eternity; the three Divine Powers, Creation,\nPreservation, Transformation, in the one Being; the three essences,\nimmortality, omniscience, joy, in the one Spirit. This is the Word, the\nSymbol, of the Master and Lord, the perfected Spiritual Man.\n\n### 28\\. Let there be soundless repetition of OM and meditation thereon.\n\nThis has many meanings, in ascending degrees. There is, first, the potency of\nthe word itself, as of all words. Then there is the manifold significance of\nthe symbol, as suggested above. Lastly, there is the spiritual realization of\nthe high essences thus symbolized. Thus we rise step by step to the Eternal.\n\n### 29\\. Thence come the awakening of interior consciousness, and the removal\nof barriers.\n\nHere again faith must be supplemented by works, the life must be led as well\nas studied, before the full meaning can be understood. The awakening of\nspiritual consciousness can only be understood in measure as it is entered. It\ncan only be entered where the conditions are present: purity of heart, and\nstrong aspiration, and the resolute conquest of each sin.\n\nThis, however, may easily be understood: that the recognition of the three\nworlds as resting in the Soul leads us to realize ourselves and all life as of\nthe Soul; that, as we dwell, not in past, present or future, but in the\nEternal, we become more at one with the Eternal; that, as we view all\norganization, preservation, mutation as the work of the Divine One, we shall\ncome more into harmony with the One, and thus remove the barriers in our path\ntoward the Light.\n\nIn the second part of the first book, the problem of the emergence of the\nspiritual man is further dealt with. We are led to the consideration of the\nbarriers to his emergence, of the overcoming of the barriers, and of certain\nsteps and stages in the ascent from the ordinary consciousness of practical\nlife, to the finer, deeper, radiant consciousness of the spiritual man.\n\n### 30\\. The barriers to interior consciousness, which drive the psychic\nnature this way and that, are these: sickness, inertia, doubt,\nlightmindedness, laziness, intemperance, false notions, inability to reach a\nstage of meditation, or to hold it when reached.\n\nWe must remember that we are considering the spiritual man as enwrapped and\nenmeshed by the psychic nature, the emotional and mental powers; and as unable\nto come to clear consciousness, unable to stand and see clearly, because of\nthe psychic veils of the personality. Nine of these are enumerated, and they\ngo pretty thoroughly into the brute toughness of the psychic nature.\n\nSickness is included rather for its effect on the emotions and mind, since\nbodily infirmity, such as blindness or deafness, is no insuperable barrier to\nspiritual life, and may sometimes be a help, as cutting off distractions. It\nwill be well for us to ponder over each of these nine activities, thinking of\neach as a psychic state, a barrier to the interior consciousness of the\nspiritual man.\n\n### 31\\. Grieving, despondency, bodily restlessness, the drawing in and\nsending forth of the life-breath also contribute to drive the psychic nature\nto and fro.\n\nThe first two moods are easily understood. We can well see bow a sodden\npsychic condition, flagrantly opposed to the pure and positive joy of\nspiritual life, would be a barrier. The next, bodily restlessness, is in a\nspecial way the fault of our day and generation. When it is conquered, mental\nrestlessness will be half conquered, too.\n\nThe next two terms, concerning the life breath, offer some difficulty. The\nsurface meaning is harsh and irregular breathing; the deeper meaning is a life\nof harsh and irregular impulses.\n\n### 32\\. Steady application to a principle is the way to put a stop to these.\n\nThe will, which, in its pristine state, was full of vigour, has been steadily\ncorrupted by self-indulgence, the seeking of moods and sensations for\nsensation's sake. Hence come all the morbid and sickly moods of the mind. The\nremedy is a return to the pristine state of the will, by vigorous, positive\neffort; or, as we are here told, by steady application to a principle. The\nprinciple to which we should thus steadily apply ourselves should be one\narising from the reality of spiritual life; valorous work for the soul, in\nothers as in ourselves.\n\n### 33\\. By sympathy with the happy, compassion for the sorrowful, delight in\nthe holy, disregard of the unholy, the psychic nature moves to gracious peace.\n\nWhen we are wrapped up in ourselves, shrouded with the cloak of our egotism,\nabsorbed in our pains and bitter thoughts, we are not willing to disturb or\nstrain our own sickly mood by giving kindly sympathy to the happy, thus\ndoubling their joy, or by showing compassion for the sad, thus halving their\nsorrow. We refuse to find delight in holy things, and let the mind brood in\nsad pessimism on unholy things. All these evil psychic moods must be conquered\nby strong effort of will. This rending of the veils will reveal to us\nsomething of the grace and peace which are of the interior consciousness of\nthe spiritual man.\n\n### 34\\. Or peace may be reached by the even sending forth and control of the\nlife-breath.\n\nHere again we may look for a double meaning: first, that even and quiet\nbreathing which is a part of the victory over bodily restlessness; then the\neven and quiet tenor of life, without harsh or dissonant impulses, which\nbrings stillness to the heart.\n\n### 35\\. Faithful, persistent application to any object, if completely\nattained, will bind the mind to steadiness.\n\nWe are still considering how to overcome the wavering and perturbation of the\npsychic nature, which make it quite unfit to transmit the inward consciousness\nand stillness. We are once more told to use the will, and to train it by\nsteady and persistent work: by 'sitting close' to our work, in the phrase of\nthe original.\n\n### 36\\. As also will a joyful, radiant spirit.\n\nThere is no such illusion as gloomy pessimism, and it has been truly said that\na man's cheerfulness is the measure of his faith. Gloom, despondency, the pale\ncast of thought, are very amenable to the will. Sturdy and courageous effort\nwill bring a clear and valorous mind. But it must always be remembered that\nthis is not for solace to the personal man, but is rather an offering to the\nideal of spiritual life, a contribution to the universal and universally\nshared treasure in heaven.\n\n### 37\\. Or the purging of self-indulgence from the psychic nature.\n\nWe must recognize that the fall of man is a reality, exemplified in our own\npersons. We have quite other sins than the animals, and far more deleterious;\nand they have all come through self-indulgence, with which our psychic natures\nare soaked through and through. As we climbed down hill for our pleasure, so\nmust we climb up again for our purification and restoration to our former high\nestate. The process is painful, perhaps, yet indispensable.\n\n### 38\\. Or a pondering on the perceptions gained in dreams and dreamless\nsleep.\n\nFor the Eastern sages, dreams are, it is true, made up of images of waking\nlife, reflections of what the eyes have seen and the ears heard. But dreams\nare something more, for the images are in a sense real, objective on their own\nplane; and the knowledge that there is another world, even a dream-world,\nlightens the tyranny of material life. Much of poetry and art is such a solace\nfrom dreamland. But there is more in dream, for it may image what is above, as\nwell as what is below; not only the children of men, but also the children by\nthe shore of the immortal sea that brought us hither, may throw their images\non this magic mirror: so, too, of the secrets of dreamless sleep with its pure\nvision, in even greater degree.\n\n### 39\\. Or meditative brooding on what is dearest to the heart.\n\nHere is a thought which our own day is beginning to grasp: that love is a form\nof knowledge; that we truly know any thing or any person, by becoming one\ntherewith, in love. Thus love has a wisdom that the mind cannot claim, and by\nthis hearty love, this becoming one with what is beyond our personal borders,\nwe may take a long step toward freedom. Two directions for this may be\nsuggested: the pure love of the artist for his work, and the earnest,\ncompassionate search into the hearts of others.\n\n### 40\\. Thus he masters all, from the atom to the Infinite.\n\nNewton was asked how he made his discoveries. By intending my mind on them, he\nreplied. This steady pressure, this becoming one with what we seek to\nunderstand, whether it be atom or soul, is the one means to know. When we\nbecome a thing, we really know it, not otherwise. Therefore live the life, to\nknow the doctrine; do the will of the Father, if you would know the Father.\n\n### 41\\. When the perturbations of the psychic nature have all been stilled,\nthen the consciousness, like a pure crystal, takes the colour of what it rests\non, whether that be the perceiver, perceiving, or the thing perceived.\n\nThis is a fuller expression of the last Sutra, and is so lucid that comment\ncan hardly add to it. Everything is either perceiver, perceiving, or the thing\nperceived; or, as we might say, consciousness, force, or matter. The sage\ntells us that the one key will unlock the secrets of all three, the secrets of\nconsciousness, force and matter alike. The thought is, that the cordial\nsympathy of a gentle heart, intuitively understanding the hearts of others, is\nreally a manifestation of the same power as that penetrating perception\nwhereby one divines the secrets of planetary motions or atomic structure.\n\n### 42\\. When the consciousness, poised in perceiving, blends together the\nname, the object dwelt on and the idea, this is perception with exterior\nconsideration.\n\nIn the first stage of the consideration of an external object, the perceiving\nmind comes to it, preoccupied by the name and idea conventionally associated\nwith that object. For example, in coming to the study of a book, we think of\nthe author, his period, the school to which he belongs. The second stage, set\nforth in the next Sutra, goes directly to the spiritual meaning of the book,\nsetting its traditional trappings aside and finding its application to our own\nexperience and problems.\n\nThe commentator takes a very simple illustration: a cow, where one considers,\nin the first stage, the name of the cow, the animal itself and the idea of a\ncow in the mind. In the second stage, one pushes these trappings aside and,\nentering into the inmost being of the cow, shares its consciousness, as do\nsome of the artists who paint cows. They get at the very life of what they\nstudy and paint.\n\n### 43\\. When the object dwells in the mind, clear of memory-pictures,\nuncoloured by the mind, as a pure luminous idea, this is perception without\nexterior or consideration.\n\nWe are still considering external, visible objects. Such perception as is here\ndescribed is of the nature of that penetrating vision whereby Newton,\nintending his mind on things, made his discoveries, or that whereby a really\ngreat portrait painter pierces to the soul of him whom he paints, and makes\nthat soul live on canvas. These stages of perception are described in this\nway, to lead the mind up to an understanding of the piercing soul-vision of\nthe spiritual man, the immortal.\n\n### 44\\. The same two steps, when referring to things of finer substance, are\nsaid to be with, or without, judicial action of the mind.\n\nWe now come to mental or psychical objects: to images in the mind. It is\nprecisely by comparing, arranging and superposing these mind-images that we\nget our general notions or concepts. This process of analysis and synthesis,\nwhereby we select certain qualities in a group of mind-images, and then range\ntogether those of like quality, is the judicial action of the mind spoken of.\nBut when we exercise swift divination upon the mind images, as does a poet or\na man of genius., then we use a power higher than the judicial, and one nearer\nto the keen vision of the spiritual man.\n\n### 45\\. Subtle substance rises in ascending degrees, to that pure nature\nwhich has no distinguishing mark.\n\nAs we ascend from outer material things which are permeated by separateness,\nand whose chief characteristic is to be separate, just as so many pebbles are\nseparate from each other; as we ascend, first, to mind-images, which overlap\nand coalesce in both space and time, and then to ideas and principles, we\nfinally come to purer essences, drawing ever nearer and nearer to unity.\n\nOr we may illustrate this principle thus. Our bodily, external selves are\nquite distinct and separate, in form, name, place, substance; our mental\nselves, of finer substance, meet and part, meet and part again, in perpetual\nconcussion and interchange; our spiritual selves attain true consciousness\nthrough unity, where the partition wall between us and the Highest, between us\nand others, is broken down and we are all made perfect in the One. The highest\nriches are possessed by all pure souls, only when united. Thus we rise from\nseparation to true individuality in unity.\n\n### 46\\. The above are the degrees of limited and conditioned spiritual\nconsciousness, still containing the seed of separateness.\n\nIn the four stages of perception above described, the spiritual vision is\nstill working through the mental and psychical, the inner genius is still\nexpressed through the outer, personal man. The spiritual man has yet to come\ncompletely to consciousness as himself, in his own realm, the psychical veils\nlaid aside.\n\n### 47\\. When pure perception without judicial action of the mind is reached,\nthere follows the gracious peace of the inner self.\n\nWe have instanced certain types of this pure perception: the poet's\ndivination, whereby he sees the spirit within the symbol, likeness in things\nunlike, and beauty in all things; the pure insight of the true philosopher,\nwhose vision rests not on the appearances of life, but on its realities; or\nthe saint's firm perception of spiritual life and being. All these are far\nadvanced on the way; they have drawn near to the secret dwelling of peace.\n\n### 48\\. In that peace, perception is unfailingly true.\n\nThe poet, the wise philosopher and the saint not only reach a wide and\nluminous consciousness, but they gain certain knowledge of substantial\nreality. When we know, we know that we know. For we have come to the stage\nwhere we know things by being them, and nothing can be more true than being.\nWe rest on the rock, and know it to be rock, rooted in the very heart of the\nworld.\n\n### 49\\. The object of this perception is other than what is learned from the\nsacred books, or by sound inference, since this perception is particular.\n\nThe distinction is a luminous and inspiring one. The Scriptures teach general\ntruths, concerning universal spiritual life and broad laws, and inference from\ntheir teaching is not less general. But the spiritual perception of the\nawakened Seer brings particular truth concerning his own particular life and\nneeds, whether these be for himself or others. He receives defined, precise\nknowledge, exactly applying to what he has at heart.\n\n### 50\\. The impress on the consciousness springing from this perception\nsupersedes all previous impressions.\n\nEach state or field of the mind, each field of knowledge, so to speak, which\nis reached by mental and emotional energies, is a psychical state, just as the\nmind picture of a stage with the actors on it, is a psychical state or field.\nWhen the pure vision, as of the poet, the philosopher, the saint, fills the\nwhole field, all lesser views and visions are crowded out. This high\nconsciousness displaces all lesser consciousness. Yet, in a certain sense,\nthat which is viewed as part, even by the vision of a sage, has still an\nelement of illusion, a thin psychical veil, however pure and luminous that\nveil may be. It is the last and highest psychic state.\n\n51\\. When this impression ceases, then, since all impressions have ceased,\nthere arises pure spiritual consciousness, with no seed of separateness left.\n\nThe last psychic veil is drawn aside, and the spiritual man stands with\nunveiled vision, pure serene.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Introduction to Book II](ysp03.htm)\n\n"
