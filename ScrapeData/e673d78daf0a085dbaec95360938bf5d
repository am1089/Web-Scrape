He searched for that\nboy (Kumara) who had entered\n\np. 162\n\ninto the (different) forms. Agni became aware of it,--'Surely, Father Pra _g_\napati is searching for me: well then, let me be suchlike that he knows me\nnot.'\n\n6:2:1:22\\. He saw those five animals,--the Purusha (man), the horse, the bull,\nthe ram, and the he-goat. Inasmuch as he saw (pa _s_ ) them, they are (called)\ncattle (pa _s_ u).\n\n6:2:1:33\\. He entered into those five animals; he became those five animals.\nBut Pra _g_ apati still searched for him.\n\n6:2:1:44\\. He saw those five animals. Because he saw (pa _s_ ) them, therefore\nthey are animals (pa _s_ u); or rather, because he saw him (Agni) in them,\ntherefore they are animals.\n\n6:2:1:55\\. He considered, 'They are Agni: I will fit them unto mine own self\n1. Even as Agni, when kindled, glares, so their eye glares; even as Agni's\nsmoke rises upwards, so vapour rises from them; even as Agni consumes what is\nput in him, so they devour; even as Agni's ashes fall down, so do their\nfaeces: they are indeed Agni; I will fit them unto mine own self.' He meant to\nslaughter them for different deities: the Purusha (man) for Vi _s_ vakarman,\nthe horse for Varu _n_ a, the bull for Indra, the ram for Tvash _t_ _ri_ , the\nhe-goat for Agni.\n\n6:2:1:66\\. He considered, 'For different deities, indeed, I mean to slaughter\nnow; but I myself desire (kam)\n\np. 163\n\n[paragraph continues] Agni's forms: well then, I will slaughter them for the\nAgnis, as for the (object of my) desire.' He slaughtered them for the Agnis,\nas for (his) desire,--to wit, 'for the Agnis,' because many were the forms of\nAgni he had set his mind upon; and 'for the desire,' because it was with a\ndesire that he slaughtered them. Having appeased them and carried the fire\nround them, he led them northwards and slew them.\n\n6:2:1:77\\. He considered, 'Those glories (signs of excellence 1) upon which I\nhave set my mind are contained in the heads: well then, I will only put on the\nheads 2.' He cut off the heads and put them on (himself, or the altar). The\nremaining trunks he then let float on the water  3, and brought the sacrifice\nto its completion by means of (the offering of) a he-goat, thinking, 'Lest my\nsacrifice be pulled to pieces.' After performing that animal sacrifice, Pra\n_g_ apati saw that he had not yet reached the end of Agni (the fire-altar).\n\n6:2:1:88\\. He considered, 'I must search for that body 4 which I let float on\nthe water.' He searched for it; and what (part) of those (bodies) cast into\nthe water had settled therein, that water he gathered; and what (had settled)\nin this earth, that clay (he gathered) 5. And having gathered both that clay\n\np. 164\n\nand water, he made a brick: hence a brick consists of these two, clay and\nwater.\n\n6:2:1:99\\. He considered, 'Surely, if I fit 1 this (matter) such as it is unto\nmine own self, I shall become a mortal carcase, not freed from evil: well\nthen, I will bake it by means of the fire.' So saying, he baked it by means of\nthe fire, and thereby made it immortal; for the sacrificial food which is\nbaked by fire is indeed immortal (or, ambrosia). Hence they bake the bricks\nwith fire: they thereby make them immortal.\n\n6:2:1:1010\\. And inasmuch as he saw them after offering (ish _t_ va) the\nanimal, therefore they are bricks (ish _t_ aka). Hence one must make the\nbricks only after performing an animal sacrifice; for those which are made\nbefore (or, without) an animal sacrifice are 'anish _t_ aka 2.' And, moreover,\nthere is this other (consideration).\n\n6:2:1:1111\\. As to those glories, they are these same heads of the victims;\nand those (headless) trunks are these five layers (of the fire-altar): thus\nwhen he builds up the layers after putting on the heads of the victims, he\nthereby unites those trunks with those heads.\n\n6:2:1:1212\\. And because Agni is all those animal victims, therefore animals\ndelight (being) near the fire 3,--\n\np. 165\n\nthere animals sport with animals. Hence the (sacrificial) fire is set up with\nhim who possesses cattle; for inasmuch as Agni (was) the same as cattle,\ntherefore Pra _g_ apati (the lord of creatures or generation) became Agni.\n\n6:2:1:1313\\. Here now some say, 'It is at this (point of the performance) that\nhe should offer up all those (five) victims; for had Pra _g_ apati then\noffered up all of them, he would certainly have reached the end of the fire\n(altar): hence were he (the Sacrificer) now to offer up all those (victims) he\nwould certainly reach the end of the fire (altar).' Let him not do so: he thus\nwould stray from where the gods have gone, he would stray from the path;--and\nwhat would he then gather 1? For those same bodies, those layers, he gathers:\nlet him therefore not do so.\n\n6:2:1:1414\\. Now when he slaughters those animals, he prepares a home for\nAgni; for nowhere but in his home does one enjoy himself. But the home means\nfood: it is that he lays down in, front, and when Agni sees that, he turns\nunto him.\n\n6:2:1:1515\\. There are a man, a horse, a bull, a ram, and a he-goat; for such\nare all the animals (used for sacrifice). Animals are food: he thus lays down\nin front whatever food there is; and seeing that, Agni turns unto him.\n\n6:2:1:1616\\. There are five; for there are those five Agnis,\n\np. 166\n\nto wit, the five layers (of the fire-altar): for them he thus lays down five\nhomes; and seeing that, Agni turns unto him.\n\n6:2:1:1717\\. And when (he offers) 'to the Agnis,'--it is because there are\nhere many Agnis, to wit, those layers; and when (he offers) 'to the desire,'\nit is in order that the Sacrificer may obtain the object for which he performs\nthat ceremony.\n\n6:2:1:1818\\. A man (purusha) he slaughters first, for man is the first of\nanimals; then a horse, for the horse comes after man; then a bull, for the\nbull (or cow) comes after the horse; then a ram, for the sheep comes after the\ncow; then a he-goat, for the goat comes after the sheep: thus he slaughters\nthem according to their form, according to their excellence.\n\n6:2:1:1919\\. Their ropes may be unequal; that of the man being the longest,\nthen shorter and shorter: thus he makes the ropes according to the form of the\nanimals, to avoid confusion between good and bad. But let them be all alike,\nall similar; for all these victims are alike, all similar, for they are (all)\ncalled Agnis, they are called food: hence they are alike and similar.\n\n6:2:1:2020\\. Here now they say, 'How is that complete five-bricked fire of his\ngained in the animals?'--Well, in the kapalas of the sacrificial cakes that\nfirst brick, the earthen one, is obtained; and when he slaughters the animal,\nthereby the animal brick is obtained, and when two gold chips are (placed) on\nboth sides of the omentum, thereby the gold brick is obtained; and what\nfirewood, stake, and enclosing sticks there are, thereby the wooden brick is\nobtained; and what ghee, sprinkling-water, and cake there are, thereby the\nfifth brick, the food, is\n\np. 167\n\nobtained: thus then that complete five-bricked fire of his is gained in the\nanimals.\n\n6:2:1:2121\\. For these (victims) there are twenty-four kindling-verses 1; for\nthe year consists of twenty-four half-moons, and Agni is the year: as great as\nAgni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus kindles him.\n\n6:2:1:2222\\. And, again, why there are twenty-four,--the Gayatri consists of\ntwenty-four syllables, and Agni is Gayatra 2: as great as Agni is, as great as\nis his measure, by so much he thus kindles him.\n\n6:2:1:2323\\. And, again, why there are twenty-four,--man (purusha) doubtless\nis twenty-fourfold: ten fingers of the hands, ten toes, and four limbs; and\nPra _g_ apati is the Purusha, and Pra _g_ apati is Agni: as great as Agni is,\nas great as is his measure, by so much he thus kindles him.\n\n6:2:1:2424\\. He recites both gayatri and trish _t_ ubh verses; for the gayatri\nmetre is the vital air, and the trish _t_ ubh is the body (self): by the\ngayatri verses he thus kindles his vital air, and by the trish _t_ ubh ones\nthe body. The trish _t_ ubh verses are in the middle, and the gayatri verses\non both sides thereof; for this body is in the middle, and the (organs of) the\nvital airs are on the sides thereof. He pronounces more gayatri verses before,\nand fewer after (the\n\np. 168\n\ntrish _t_ ubh verses); for there are more (organs of the) vital airs in front,\nand fewer behind.\n\n6:2:1:2525\\. He recites (Va _g_. S. XXVII, 1), 'May the months 1, O Agni, may\nthe seasons make thee grow!' When Agni restored the relaxed Pra _g_ apati, he\n(Pra _g_ apati) said to him, 'What kindling-verses there are equal to me (in\nmeasure), with them kindle me!'\n\n6:2:1:2626\\. He (Agni) saw these (verses), 'May the months, O Agni, may the\nseasons make thee grow!' that is, 'May both the months, O Agni, and the\nseasons make thee grow!'--'The years, the _Ri_ shis, whatsoever truths' that\nis, 'May the years, and the _Ri_ shis, and the truths make thee grow!'--'With\nheavenly brightness do thou shine!'--the heavenly brightness doubtless is\nyonder sun: thus 'together with that do thou shine!'--'lighten up the whole\nfour regions!' that is, 'lighten up all the four regions!'\n\n6:2:1:2727\\. These (verses) have one and the same explanation regarding him\n(Agni-Pra _g_ apati): how one would make him complete, how he would restore\nand produce him. They relate to Agni and Pra _g_ apati: to Agni, inasmuch as\nAgni saw (them); to Pra _g_ apati, inasmuch as he (Agni) kindled Pra _g_\napati.\n\np. 169\n\n6:2:1:2828\\. Twelve \xc3\x82pri (propitiatory) verses 1 there are,--twelve months are\na year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure,\nwith so much he thus propitiates (or gratifies) him.\n\n6:2:1:2929\\. And, again, why there are twelve,--of twelve syllables consists\nthe _G_ agati, and the _G_ agati is this earth, for on her there is everything\nthat moves ( _g_ ag-at) here. And Agni also is this earth, for it is out of\nher that the whole fire (altar) is built up: as great as Agni is, as great as\nis his measure, by so much he thus propitiates him.\n\n6:2:1:3030\\. And, again, why there are twelve,--of twelve syllables consists\nthe _G_ agati, and the _G_ agati is all the metres, and all the metres are Pra\n_g_ apati (the sacrifice), and Pra _g_ apati is Agni: as great as Agni is, as\ngreat as is his measure, by so much he thus propitiates him.\n\n6:2:1:3131\\. Those 'kindling-sticks of his (Agni) are upright.' When Agni\nrestored the relaxed Pra _g_ apati, he said to him, 'What \xc3\x82pri-verses there\nare equal to me, with them propitiate me!'\n\n6:2:1:3232\\. He saw these (verses) 2:--'Upright are his kindling-sticks,' for\nupright indeed are the kindling-sticks of him when kindled;--'upwards tending\nthe bright flashes of Agni,' for tending upwards are his bright flashes, his\nflames;--'they, the most brilliant,' that is 'the most powerful;'--'of the\nfair-looking son,' for fair-looking indeed Agni is on all sides; and inasmuch\nas he (the Sacrificer) produces him thereby he (Agni) is his son.\n\np. 170\n\n6:2:1:3333\\. These (verses) have one and the same explanation regarding him\n(Agni-Pra _g_ apati): how one would make him complete, how he would restore\nand produce him. They relate to Agni and Pra _g_ apati,--to Agni, inasmuch as\nAgni saw (them); to Pra _g_ apati, inasmuch as he (Agni) propitiated Pra _g_\napati.\n\n6:2:1:3434\\. They are unequal, and consist of unequal feet, and unequal\nsyllables; for the metres are unequal: whatever unequal limbs there are at his\n(Agni's) body, those (limbs) of his he propitiates by these (verses).\n\n6:2:1:3535\\. The animal cake belongs to (Agni) Vai _s_ vanara--Vai _s_ vanara\nbeing all the fires--for the obtainment of all the fires.\n\n6:2:1:3636\\. As to why it belongs to Vai _s_ vanara;--those layers (of the\naltar) no doubt are the seasons, for the seasons are the fires; and the\nseasons are the year, and the year is Vai _s_ vanara (belonging to all men).\nWere it (offered) to Agni (Vai _s_ vanara), he would cause it (the formula) to\nbe redundant. It is one on twelve potsherds: twelve months are a year, and the\nyear is Vai _s_ vanara. The offering and invitatory formulas relate to Agni,\nfor the obtainment of Agni's forms. They contain the word 'kama' (desire), for\nthe obtainment of his desires.\n\n6:2:1:3737\\. Now some, having in that way 1 obtained those heads, put them on\n(the fire-altar), thinking, 'Either way 2 are they animals.' But they (who do\nthis) become mortal carcases, for unpropitiated are\n\np. 171\n\nthose (heads) of theirs. In this way, indeed, they did put them on for Asha\n_dh_ i Sau _s_ romateya 1; but quickly indeed he died after that.\n\n6:2:1:3838\\. Some, however, make gold ones, saying, 'They are immortal bricks\n(am _ri_ tesh _t_ aka).' But indeed those are false bricks (an _ri_ tesh _t_\naka), those are no heads of victims.\n\n6:2:1:3939\\. Some, again, make earthen ones, thinking, 'Passed away, forsooth,\nare these animals, and this earth is the shelter of all that has passed away:\nthus whither those animals have gone, from thence we collect them.' Let him\nnot do so, for whoso knows not both the practice and theory of these\n(victims), for him let them be passed away. Let him slaughter those very five\nvictims, as far as he may be able to do so; for it was these Pra _g_ apati was\nthe first to slaughter, and _S_ yapar _n_ a Sayakayana the last; and in the\ninterval also people used to slaughter them. But nowadays only these two are\nslaughtered, the one for Pra _g_ apati, and the one for Vayu. The theory of\nthese two is now (to be) told.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[161:3](sbe4131.htm#fr_328) This is the so-called ish _t_ aka-pa _s_ u, or\nanimal sacrifice performed with regard to the bricks; the heads of the victims\nbeing used in building up the altar, whilst some of the blood is mixed with\nthe clay of which the bricks are made.\n\n[162:1](sbe4131.htm#fr_329) Or, I will make them part of mine own self.--\nSimilarly St. Petersburg dictionary, 'I will change them into myself.' But\ndifferently Professor Delbruck, Altind. Synt., p. 239, 'I will make myself to\nbe these, change myself into these.' This is on account of the middle form of\nthe verb, which, however, is quite justified also in the former\ninterpretation. Cf. [VI, 8, 2, 1](sbe4154.htm#6:8:2:1), where there is no\nquestion of changing the whole sacrifice into a heap of ashes, but of taking\nover the ashes, or some of it, to form part of the sacrifice.\n\n[163:1](sbe4131.htm#fr_330) See [VI, 1, 1, 4](sbe4128.htm#6:1:1:4).\n\n[163:2](sbe4131.htm#fr_331) That is, on the fire-altar, or (which is the same\nthing) on himself, Pra _g_ apati, the sacrifice. The heads of the five victims\nare placed in (a dish introduced into) the bottom layer of the altar so as to\nimpart stability to it. See [VII, 5, 2, 1](sbe4166.htm#7:5:2:1) seq.\n\n[163:3](sbe4131.htm#fr_332) Or, he washed them, cleaned them, in water.\n\n[163:4](sbe4131.htm#fr_333) Literally, that self, i.e. that part of mine own\nself, the sacrifice (?).\n\n[163:5](sbe4131.htm#fr_334) It seemed desirable here to leave the construction\nof the original text unchanged.\n\n[164:1](sbe4131.htm#fr_335) Saya _n_ a explains 'abhisa _m_ skarishye' by\n'adhiya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ike _s_ arira upadhasyami,' 'if I were to put this (clay and\nwater) on the sacrificial body.'\n\n[164:2](sbe4131.htm#fr_336) A play on the word which may mean either 'non-\nbricks,' or 'being without oblation (ish _t_ a).'\n\n[164:3](sbe4131.htm#fr_337) Saya _n_ a seems to take this to mean, that\nanimals (cattle) delight, or sport, when the sacrificial fire is established;\nthat is to say, they feel at home and increase wherever a new household is\nestablished (?);--tasmad agnav ahite pa _s_ avo ramante, atmany eva sa pritir\nity abhipraya _h_. Adhuna\xe0\xa4\xbdgne _h_ pa _s_ ushv atmabhuteshu priti _m_ p. 165\ndar _s_ ayann aha, yasmad agnir esha yat pa _s_ avas tasmad yasya manushyasya\npa _s_ avo bhavanti tasminn etad agnir adhiyate, tatra hi sa atmabhutai _h_ pa\n_s_ ubhi ramate nanyatra; evam yad agnyatmika _h_ pa _s_ avas tatas tam agnim\natma\xe0\xa4\xbdbhisa _m_ sk _ri_ tya pra _g_ apatir agnir abhavat.\n\n[165:1](sbe4131.htm#fr_338) That is, what 'sambharas' or equipments of the\nfire should he then collect? Cf. part i, p. 276.\n\n[167:1](sbe4131.htm#fr_339) For the eleven gayatri verses, used as samidhenis\nat an ordinary ish _t_ i--and raised to the number of fifteen by repetitions\nof the first and last verses--see part i, p. 102. The present animal sacrifice\n(ish _t_ aka-pa _s_ u) adds to these verses nine trish _t_ ubh verses (Va _g_.\nS. XXVII, 1-9), which (according to Katy. XVI, 1, 11) are to be inserted\nbetween the two verses containing the words 'samidhyamana' (being kindled) and\n'samiddha' (kindled) respectively,--that is, between the ninth and tenth of\nthe normal or gayatri kindling-verses (cf. I, 4, 1, 38).\n\n[167:2](sbe4131.htm#fr_340) See [VI, 1, 1, 15](sbe4128.htm#6:1:1:15); [3,\n19](sbe4130.htm#6:1:3:19).\n\n[168:1](sbe4131.htm#fr_341) This is the meaning assigned here to 'sama _h_ '\nby Mahidhara, a doubtful meaning indeed. Besides the ordinary meaning year,'\nthe St. Petersburg dictionary also allows to 'sama' that of 'half-year' in\nsome passages of the Atharva-veda. In the present passage, the dictionary\nrefers 'sama _h_ ' to the adjective 'sama,' hence 'the equal seasons.' This\ncannot, however, have been the meaning assigned to the word by the author of\nthis part of the Brahma _n_ a, whatever it may originally have been in this\nverse of the Sa _m_ hitas. Saya _n_ a, Taitt. S. IV, 1, 7, takes 'sama _h_ '\nin the sense of 'the years,' but remarks that 'the months and half-months'\nhave to be understood by it in this verse.\n\n[169:1](sbe4131.htm#fr_342) For the purport of these verses which form the\noffering-prayers at the fore-offerings of the animal sacrifice, see part ii,\np. 185, note 1.\n\n[169:2](sbe4131.htm#fr_343) Va _g_. S. XXVII, II seq.\n\n[170:1](sbe4131.htm#fr_344) That is, according to Saya _n_ a, somehow or\nother, in some worldly manner, as by buying or begging them, without\nperforming the animal sacrifice.\n\n[170:2](sbe4131.htm#fr_345) That is to say, whether they are consecrated or\nunconsecrated, in either case they are 'pa _s_ ava _h_ ' or animal (victims).\nSay.\n\n[171:1](sbe4131.htm#fr_346) The son of Asha _dh_ a and Su _s_ romata,\naccording to Saya _n_ a.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 2, 2.
