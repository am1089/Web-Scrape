The (highest) Self has to be understood (in Ait. \xc3\x82r. II, 4, i), as in\nother places; on account of the subsequent (qualification).\n\nWe read in the Aitareyaka (II, 4, i), 'Verily, in the beginning all this was\nSelf, one only; there was nothing\n\np. 206\n\nelse blinking whatsoever. He thought, shall I send forth worlds? He sent forth\nthese worlds, the (heavenly) waters, the rays, the mortal (earth), and water.'\n--Here the doubt presents itself whether the term 'Self' denotes the highest\nSelf or some other being.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains the latter view, which is borne out, he says, by an\nexamination of the connected sense of the whole passage.--But, an objection is\nraised, an examination of that kind rather leads to the conclusion that the\nhighest Self is meant; for the passage says that before the creation the Self\nonly existed and that the creation was preceded by thought.--No such\nconclusion is possible, the purvapakshin replies, since the passage relates\nthe creation of the worlds. If it aimed at representing the highest Self as\nthe creator, it would speak of the creation of the elements, of which the\nworlds are only certain combinations. That the worlds are meant by the terms\n'water,' &c., appears from the subsequent clause (4), 'That water is above the\nheaven,' &c.--Now _S_ ruti and Sm _ri_ ti teach that the creation of the\nworlds is accomplished by some inferior Lord different from--and superintended\nby--the highest Self; cp. e.g. B _ri_. Up. I, 4, 1, 'In the beginning this was\nSelf alone, in the shape of a person,' and the Sm _ri_ ti-passage, 'He is the\nfirst embodied soul, he is called the person; he the prime creator of the\nbeings was in the beginning evolved from Brahman.' And the Aitareyins\nthemselves record in a previous prakara _n_ a (II, 1, 3, 1, 'Next follows the\norigin of seed. The seed of Pra _g_ apati are the Devas ') that this manifold\ncreation was accomplished by Pra _g_ apati. That to the latter being the word\n'Self' is sometimes applied appears from the passage quoted above from the--B\n_ri_. Up. And Pra _g_ apati also may be spoken of as being before the creation\none only, if we consider that then his products did not yet exist; and thought\nalso may be ascribed to him as he, of course, is of an intelligent nature.\nMoreover, the passages, 'He led a cow towards them; he led a horse towards\nthem; he led man towards them; then they said,' &c. (II, 4, 2, 2), which are\nin agreement with what is known about the various activities of particular\nqualified Selfs belonging\n\np. 207\n\nto the apparent world, show that in the Aitareyaka also some such qualified\nSelf is meant.\n\nTo this we reply that the highest Self is meant in the Aitareyaka 'as in other\nplaces.' As in other accounts of the creation ('From that Self ether was\nproduced,' Taitt. Up. II, 1, &c.) the highest Self has to be understood, and,\nas in other cases where the term 'Self' is applied to particular Selfs, the\n'Self within' (i.e. the highest Self) has to be understood in the first place;\nso it is here also.--In those passages, on the other hand, where the Self is\nqualified by some other attribute, such as 'having the shape of a person,' we\nmust understand that some particular Self is meant.--In the Aitareyaka,\nhowever, we meet with a qualification, subsequent to the first reference to\nthe Self, which agrees only with the highest Self; we mean the one implied in\nthe passage, 'He thought, shall I send forth worlds? He sent forth these\nworlds.'--Hence we maintain that the highest Self is meant.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 17](sbe38160.htm)\n\n"
