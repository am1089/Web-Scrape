Now, therefore, we will declare what may be eaten and what may not be\neaten.\n\n2\\. Food given by a physician, a hunter, a woman of bad character, a mace-\nbearer, a thief, an Abhi _s_ asta, a eunuch, (or) an outcast must not be\neaten, 2\n\n3\\. (Nor that given) by a miser, one who has performed the initiatory ceremony\nof a _S_ rauta-sacrifice, a prisoner, a sick person, a seller of the Soma-\nplant, a carpenter, a washerman, a dealer in spirituous liquor, a spy, a\nusurer, (or) a cobbler, 3\n\n4\\. Nor (that given) by a _S_ udra, 4\n\n5\\. Nor (that given) by one who lives by his weapons, 5\n\n6\\. Nor (that given) by the (kept) paramour of a 6\n\np. 70\n\nmarried woman, or by a husband who allows a paramour (to his wife),\n\n7\\. Nor (that given) by an incendiary,\n\n8\\. Nor (that given) by (a ruler) who does not slay those worthy of capital\npunishment,\n\n9\\. Nor (food) offered publicly with these words, 'Who is willing to eat?' 9\n\n10\\. Nor food given by a multitude of givers, or by harlots, and so forth. 10\n\n11\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'The gods do not eat (the\nofferings) of a man who keeps dogs, nor of him whose (only) wife is of the _S_\nudra caste, nor of him who lives in subjection to his wife, nor of (a husband)\nwho (permits) a paramour (of his wife to reside) in his house.' 11\n\n12\\. He may accept (the following presents even) from such (people, viz.)\nfirewood, water, fodder, Ku _s_ a grass, parched grain, (food) given without\nasking, a vehicle, (shelter in) the house, small fish, millet, a garland,\nperfumes, honey, and meat. 12\n\n13\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'For the sake of a Guru, when\nhe desires to save his wife (and family from starvation), when he wishes to\nhonour the gods or guests, he may accept (presents) from anybody; but let him\nnot satisfy his (own hunger) with such (gifts).' 13\n\np. 71\n\n14\\. Food given by a hunter who uses the bow must not be rejected.\n\n15\\. For it is declared in the Veda, 'At a sacrificial session (sattra), which\nlasted one thousand years, Agastya went out to hunt. He had sacrificial cakes\nprepared with the meat of beasts and fowls good (to eat).' 15\n\n16\\. With reference to this (subject) they quote also some verses proclaimed\nby Pra _g_ apati, 'Pra _g_ apati (the Lord of created beings) has declared\nthat food freely offered and brought (by the giver himself) may be eaten,\nthough (the giver) be a sinful man, provided the gift has not been asked for\nbeforehand.' 16\n\n17\\. Food offered by a man who has faith must certainly be eaten, even though\n(the giver) be a thief, but not that given by (a Brahma _n_ a) who sacrifices\nfor many and who initiates many.'\n\n18\\. 'The manes do not eat during fifteen years (the food) of that man who\ndisdains a (freely offered gift), nor does the fire carry his offerings (to\nthe gods).' 18\n\n19\\. 'But alms, though offered without asking, must not be accepted from a\nphysician, from a hunter, from a surgeon or a (very) wicked man, from a\neunuch, and from a faithless wife.' 19\n\n20\\. Fragments of food left by other persons than the teacher must not be\neaten, 20\n\n21\\. Nor remnants of one's own (meal) and food touched by leavings,\n\np. 72\n\n22\\. Nor (food) defiled by contact with a garment, hair, or insects. 22\n\n23\\. But at pleasure he may use (such food) after taking out the hair and the\ninsects, sprinkling it with water, dropping ashes on it, and (after it has\nbeen declared) fit for use by the word (of a Brahma _n_ a). 23\n\n24\\. With reference to this (subject) they quote also some verses proclaimed\nby Pra _g_ apati, The gods created for Brahma _n_ as three means of purifying\n(defiled substances), viz. ignorance (of defilement), sprinkling (them) with\nwater, and commending (them) by word of mouth.' 24\n\n25\\. Let him not throw away that food which, at a procession with images of\nthe gods, at weddings, and at sacrifices, is touched by crows or dogs.'\n\n26\\. After the (defiled) portion has been removed, the remainder shall be\npurified, liquids by straining them, but solid food by sprinkling it with\nwater.' 26\n\n27\\. 'What has been touched by the mouth of a cat is even pure.'\n\n28\\. (Cooked food which has become) stale (by being kept), what is naturally\nbad, what has been placed once only in the dish, what has been cooked more\nthan once, raw (food), and (food) insufficiently cooked (must not be eaten).\n28\n\n29\\. But at pleasure he may use (such food) after pouring over it sour milk or\nclarified butter. 29\n\np. 73\n\n30\\. With reference to this (subject) they quote also some verses proclaimed\nby Pra _g_ apati, 'A Brahma _n_ a shall not eat clarified butter or oil which\ndrips from the nails (of the giver). Yama has declared such (food to be)\nimpure; (to eat it is as sinful) as to partake of cow's flesh.'\n\n31\\. 'But fatty substances, salt, and condiments proffered with the hand do\nnot benefit the giver, and he who partakes of them will eat sin.'\n\n32\\. 'Let him give, therefore, such substances placed on a leaf or on grass,\nbut never with his hands or in an iron vessel.'\n\n33\\. For eating garlic, onions, mushrooms, turnips, _S_ leshmantaka,\nexudations from trees, the red sap flowing from incisions (in trees or\nplants), food pecked at by crows or worried by dogs, or the leavings of a _S_\nudra, an Atik _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra (penance must be performed). 33\n\n34\\. (Let him not drink) the milk of a cow that is in heat, nor of one whose\ncalf has died, 34\n\n35\\. Nor that which cows, buffalo-cows, and goats give during the first ten\ndays (after giving birth to young ones), 35\n\n36\\. Nor water collected at the bottom of a boat.\n\n37\\. Let him avoid wheat-cakes, (fried) grain, porridge, barley-meal, pulse-\ncakes, oil, rice boiled in milk, and vegetables that have turned sour (by\nstanding), 37\n\np. 74\n\n38\\. Likewise other kinds of (sour) food prepared with milk and barley-flour.\n\n39\\. Among five-toed animals, the porcupine, the hedgehog, the hare, the\ntortoise, and the iguana may be eaten, 39\n\n40\\. Among (domestic) animals those having teeth in one jaw only, excepting\ncamels. 40\n\n41\\. And among fishes, the long-nosed crocodile, the Gavaya, the porpoise, the\nalligator, and the crab (must not be eaten), 41\n\n42\\. Nor those which are misshaped or have heads like snakes,\n\n43\\. Nor the bos Gaurus, the Gayal, and the _S_ arabha, 43\n\n44\\. Nor those that have not been (specially mentioned (as fit for food), 44\n\n45\\. Nor milch-cows, draught-oxen, and animals whose milk teeth have not\ndropped out. 45\n\n46\\. It is declared in the Va _g_ asaneyaka, that (the flesh of) milch-cows\nand oxen is fit for offerings. 46\n\n47\\. But regarding the rhinoceros and the wild boar they make conflicting\nstatements.\n\n48\\. And among birds, those who seek their food by scratching with their feet,\nthe web-footed ones, the Kalavi\xe1\xb9\x85ka, the water-hen, the flamingo, the 48\n\np. 75\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahma _n_ i duck, the Bhasa, the crow, the blue pigeon,\nthe osprey, the _K_ ataka, the dove, the crane, the black partridge, the grey\nheron, the vulture, the falcon, the white egret, the ibis, the cormorant, the\npeewit, the flying-fox, those flying about at night, the woodpecker, the\nsparrow, the Railataka, the green pigeon, the wagtail, the village-cock, the\nparrot, the starling, the cuckoo, those feeding on flesh, and those living\nabout villages (must not be eaten).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[69:2](sbe1417.htm#fr_412) **XIV**.
