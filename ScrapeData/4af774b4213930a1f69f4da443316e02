'Do you know to what place men go from here?' 'No, Sir,' he replied.\n\np. 77\n\n'Do you know how they return again?' 'No Sir,' he replied.\n\n'Do you know where the path of Devas and the path of the fathers diverge?'\n'No, Sir,' he replied.\n\n3\\. 'Do you know why that world 1 never becomes full?' 'No, Sir,' he replied.\n\n'Do you know why in the fifth libation water is called Man 2? No, Sir,' he\nreplied.\n\n4\\. 'Then why did you say (you had been) instructed? How could anybody who did\nnot know these things say that he had been instructed?' Then the boy went back\nsorrowful to the place of his father, and said: 'Though you had not instructed\nme, Sir, you said you had instructed me.\n\n5\\. 'That fellow of a Ra _g_ anya, asked me five questions, and I could not\nanswer one of them.' The father said: 'As you have told me these questions of\nhis, I do not know any one of them 3. If I knew these questions, how should I\nnot have told you 4?'\n\n6\\. Then Gautama went to the king's place, and when he had come to him, the\nking offered him proper respect. In the morning the king went out on his way\nto the assembly 5. The king said to him:\n\np. 78\n\n[paragraph continues] 'Sir, Gautama, ask a boon of such things as men\npossess.' He replied: 'Such things as men possess may remain with you. Tell me\nthe speech which you addressed to the boy.'\n\n7\\. The king was perplexed, and commanded him, saying: 'Stay with me some\ntime.' Then he said: 'As (to what) you have said to me, Gautama, this\nknowledge did not go to any Brahma _n_ a before you, and therefore this\nteaching belonged in all the worlds to the Kshatra class alone.

XIV, 9, 3.\n\n[77:3](sbe01097.htm#fr_243) I doubt whether the elliptical construction of\nthese sentences is properly filled out by the commentator. In the B _ri_\nhadara _n_ yaka the construction is much easier. 'You know me well enough to\nknow that whatever I know, I told you.'\n\n[77:4](sbe01097.htm#fr_244) I read avedishyam, though both the text and\ncommentary give avadishyam. Still viditavan asmi points to an original\navedishyam, and a parallel passage, VI, 1, 7, confirms this emendation.\n\n[77:5](sbe01097.htm#fr_245) Cf. _Kh_. Up.
