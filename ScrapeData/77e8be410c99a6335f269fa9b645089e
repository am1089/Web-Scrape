We like to hear this stated, though we had not\nneeded to be told that our home was beautiful. In the mists of November\nevenings, when a couple of street lamps, swung from wall brackets at long\ndistances, serve to light up the irregular house-fronts--that stand side by\nside as if treading on each other\'s toes in subdued and solemn eagerness--we\ncould not have doubted that our lane was very lovely. Here a small verandah\ncarries the front backwards; there a wall crowds forward, as if to see. The\nhandsome old mouldings round some doorway, again, are half obscured under\nsuccessive coats of plaster. And everywhere their dress of whitewash gives\nthese substantial Indian buildings a look as of tall persons,\n\np. 11\n\ndecorously wrapped from head to foot in the white and unsewn garments of the\nEast, or, may-hap, at the clear black midnight, thrills one with a suggestion\nof the pale and sheeted dead.\n\nBut if those strangers who have beauty in their hearts can be so affected by\nour Indian lane, what would they say could they see with our eyes our zenana\nterrace? Has the reader, in his Western home, some favourite window, with view\nof lawn and trees, and fringed in early spring with bursting bulbs, or some\nspecially beloved ingle-nook, where fire and picture and low seat make cosy\nwelcome, filling him with the sense of light and peace? In that case he can\nunderstand what our terrace is to us. Third of our four courtyards, it opens\non the level of the second story. Rooms with higher roofs surround it on three\nsides, and on the fourth it is enclosed by a high wall, part of which is\npierced, to form a screen. In the centre, perfect in its simplicity, a light\nwooden railing, with four stone corner-posts, protects us from the danger of a\nfall into the court below. And from the south-east angle of the terrace a\nnarrow staircase, ending in a square and solid tower, climbs steeply up to the\nroofs and terraces above. Oh, that staircase! By it Crivelli\'s Angel of\nAnnunciation might fittingly descend, as Herald of God, to seek below her who\nwas blessed amongst all women. Of one\n\np. 12\n\nthing at least we may be sure; between Crivelli\'s Angel and his staircase\nthere would in that case be no disparity.\n\nOr we turn in the opposite direction, and, overtopping the western wall, rise\nthe gnarled boughs and fernlike leafage of a _neem_ tree. Planted according to\nold Calcutta custom beside a neighbour\'s house, to ward off the malaria that\ncomes with the east winds, this tree of healing is our perpetual joy. Constant\nbreath and motion does it give. In, out, and about it play the sparrows, safe\nin its hiding from all their foes, while human creatures talk, or gravely sit\nand watch, below. Nor are the sparrows all its guests. On its outmost branches\nperch the crows--so full of humour though they cannot laugh! We take but\nlittle notice of these aggressive gentlemen, though we are well aware that our\nmode of life is to them a subject of perpetual curiosity, and they frequently\nwarn and advise us as to the ways of their own kind, with the friendliest\nintentions. A crow\'s manner makes one feel that his information of to-day\nwould, if possible, be his instructions of to-morrow. And the pigeons come--\nthe pigeons who live downstairs, in the front courtyard, and sometimes talk\nthe whole night long. Or a single kingfisher will arrive, and for a couple of\nweeks together will give his loud clear call from the same spot at the same\nhour, every day, and then\n\np. 13\n\nfly away. But what we love best are the little birds, and there are many--the\ntiny _tun-tun_ , so much smaller than the sparrow, and an occasional _maina_ ,\nand now and then a down-swooping swallow, with other kinds whose names we do\nnot even know. Yes, and as in the early morning or late afternoon we watch the\nbirds that fly in flocks, away and away to the north, with the sunlight\nshining on their white breasts and under-wings, we know that if to these our\ndwelling-place offer any landmark we owe it all to the _neem_ tree that lives\nby our side. By its graciousness and beauty alone are won what place we may\nenjoy in the lives and counsels of the birds.\n\nAnd something, however little, there surely is. In India all the small birds\nand beasts that seek the shelter of the house are holy. They come in the train\nof Lakshmi, the Goddess of Fortune, and show that her presence is about us.\nAnd it was a yellow-clad _fakir_ who, seated with us one day in silent\nwatching of the loves and quarrels, the faithfulness and mutual forgiveness of\nthe sparrows, suddenly broke his musing with the words, "How wonderful that\nthey can live thus without a scripture!"\n\nBut our terrace wall, with the bed of flowers and creeper that runs along it,\nturns a corner. From west it bends some short way to the north. The way is\nvery short, for here begin the dwelling-\n\np. 14\n\nrooms again. But in this end is the perforated curtain-like screen through\nwhich the women-folk may take a furtive look at as much of the gay world as\ncan be seen in the neighbouring quarter. And above it, but at some distance\nbeyond, rise, to the sight of a watcher within the house, the tall green-\nturbaned heads of a line of cocoanut palms. One behind the other they stand, a\nprocession that faces the light as it rises in the east. An hour passes, and\nit strikes level against the underside of their upright fronds, and then, for\nten minutes or so, an anthem, of light thrown back, is chanted to the\nascending sun. Then all again grows grey, veiled in the excessive radiance of\nthe tropics, and day wears on. But the morning glory of the palm-trees is not\nall. The afternoon has come, and at an hour before sunset the eastward-shining\nbeams once more strike level with the great green crowns. This time, however,\nthe sun-rays are caught on the upper surface of low-hanging down-curved\nleaves, and so twice every day the palm-trees worship God; and Hindu eyes,\ntrained to seek and respond to the cosmic spectacle, look out from secluded\ndwellings behind enclosing walls to note this, the matins and evensong of\nlight.\n\nEarlier and later float down to us, on the terrace, the sound of bells rung in\nthe prayer-room of each neighbouring household at the hour of worship. Or\nagain, in the moment of twilight,\n\np. 15\n\nere yet the young moon is clear above the _neem_ , there come as is fit great\nthoughts, wide rendings of the veil that hides the Infinite. For this terrace\nof ours, this hearth of the soul, is silent and hidden and distant from the\nworld, and whether at midnight in the starlight, or seated in the daytime\nwithin the shadow of the wall, or even lingering in the sun about the\ndoorways, it is impossible there to forget Crivelli\'s Angel, or to do aught\nbut await, passive and half-expectant, the inflood of the Divine upon the\nheart of man.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Hindu Widow and the Zenana](seh08.htm)\n\n'
