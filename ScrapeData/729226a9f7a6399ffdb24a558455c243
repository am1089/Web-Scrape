And there is no objection on account of its not having an activity (kara\n_n_ a); for (Scripture) thus declares.\n\nThe kara _n_ a of the Sutra means kriya, action. The objection raised on the\nground that the principal breath does not exercise any form of activity\nhelpful to the soul, is without force, since as a matter of fact Scripture\ndeclares that there is such an activity, in so far as the vital breath\nsupports the body with all its organs. For the text ( _Kh_. Up. V, 1, 7 ff.)\nrelates how on the successive departure of speech, and so on, the body and the\nother organs maintained their strength, while on the departure of the vital\nbreath the body and all the organs at once became weak and powerless.--The\nconclusion therefore is that the breath, in its fivefold form of pra _n_ a,\napana, and so on, subserves the purposes of the individual soul, and thus\noccupies the position of an instrument, no less than the eye and the other\norgans.\n\np. 575\n\nBut as those five forms of breath, viz. pra _n_ a, udana, &c., have different\nnames and functions they must be separate principles (and hence there is not\n_one_ principal breath)!
