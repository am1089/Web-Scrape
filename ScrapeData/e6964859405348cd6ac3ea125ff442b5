Now various indeed are the customs of the (different) countries and the\ncustoms of the (different) villages: those one should observe at the wedding.\n\n2\\. What, however, is commonly accepted, that we shall state.\n\n3 3. Having placed to the west of the fire a mill-stone, to the north-east (of\nthe fire) a water-pot, he should sacrifice, while she takes hold of him.\nStanding, with his face turned to the west, while she is sitting and turns her\nface to the east, he should with (the formula), 'I seize thy hand for the sake\nof happiness seize her thumb if he desires that only male children may be born\nto him;\n\n4\\. Her other fingers, (if he is) desirous of female (children);\n\n5\\. The hand on the hair-side together with the\n\np. 168\n\nthumb, (if) desirous of both (male and female children).\n\n6 6. Leading her three times round the fire and the water-pot, so that their\nright sides are turned towards (the fire, &c.), he murmurs, 'This am I, that\nart thou; that art thou, this am I; the heaven I, the earth thou; the Saman I,\nthe _Ri_ _k_ thou. Come! Let us here marry. Let us beget offspring. Loving,\nbright, with genial mind may we live a hundred autumns.'\n\n7 7. Each time after he has lead her (so) round, he makes her tread on the\nstone with (the words), 'Tread on this stone; like a stone be firm. Overcome\nthe enemies; tread the foes down.'\n\n8 8. Having 'spread under' (i.e. having first poured \xc3\x82 _g_ ya over her hands),\nher brother or a person acting in her brother's place pours fried grain twice\nover the wife's joined hands.\n\n9 9. Three times for descendants of _G_ amadagni.\n\n10\\. He pours again (\xc3\x82 _g_ ya) over (what has been left of) the sacrificial\nfood,\n\n11\\. And over what has been cut off.\n\n12\\. This is the rule about the portions to be cut off.\n\n13 13. 'To god Aryaman the girls have made sacrifice,\n\np. 169\n\nto Agni; may he, god Aryaman, loosen her from this, and not from that place,\nSvaha!\n\n'To god Varu _n_ a the girls have made sacrifice, to Agni; may he, god Varu\n_n_ a, &c.\n\n'To god Pushan the girls have made sacrifice, to Agni; may he, god Pushan,\n&c.'\xc2\x97with (these verses recited by the bridegroom) she should sacrifice (the\nfried grain) without opening her joined hands, as if (she did so) with the\n(spoon called) Sru _k_.\n\n14 14-15. Without that leading round (the fire, she sacrifices grain) with the\nneb of a basket towards herself silently a fourth time.\n\n15\\. Some lead the bride round each time after the fried grain has been poured\nout: thus the two last oblations do not follow immediately on each other.\n\n16\\. He then loosens her two locks of hair, if they are made, (i.e. if) two\ntufts of wool are bound round her hair on the two sides,\n\n17\\. With (the _Ri_ _k_ ),'I release thee from the band of Varu _n_ a' (Rig-\nveda X, 85, 24).\n\n18\\. The left one with the following ( _Ri_ _k_ ).\n\n19 19. He then causes her to step forward in a northeastern direction seven\nsteps with (the words), 'For sap with one step, for juice with two steps, for\nthriving of wealth with three steps, for comfort with four steps, for\noffspring with five steps, for the seasons\n\np. 170\n\nwith six steps. Be friend with seven steps. So be thou devoted to me. Let us\nacquire many sons who may reach old age!'\n\n20 20. Joining together their two heads, (the bridegroom? the \xc3\x82 _k_ arya?)\nsprinkles them (with water) from the water-pot.\n\n21\\. And she should dwell that night in the house of an old Brahma _n_ a woman\nwhose husband is alive and whose children are alive.\n\n22 22. When she sees the polar-star, the star Arundhati, and the seven _Ri_\nshis (ursa major), let her break the silence (and say), 'May my husband live\nand I get offspring.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[167:3](sbe29106.htm#fr_389) 7, 3. Professor Stenzler is evidently right in\ntaking a _s_ manam as in apposition to d _ri_ shadam.

According to those teachers whose\nopinion is related in Sutras 6-14, the leading round the fire, the treading on\nthe stone, and the offering of fried grain (with the three parts of the\nMantra, Sutra 1 3) are repeated thrice; then follows the offering prescribed\nin Sutra 14, so that the last two offerings follow immediately on each other.\nThis is not the case, if in the first three instances the order of the\ndifferent rites is inverted, as stated in Sutra 15.\n\nIn Sutra 14 Naraya _n_ a explains _s_ urpapu _t_ a by ko _n_ a.\n\n[169:19](sbe29106.htm#fr_396) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya I, 14, 5. 6; 13, 2;\nParaskara I, 8, 1.\n\n[170:20](sbe29106.htm#fr_397) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya I, 14, 9; Paraskara I,\n8, 5.\n\n[170:22](sbe29106.htm#fr_398) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya I, 17, 2 seq.;\nParaskara I, 8, 19.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 8](sbe29107.htm)\n\n"
