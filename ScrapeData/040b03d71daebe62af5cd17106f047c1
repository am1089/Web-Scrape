The body is a compound of p\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadhiv\xc4\xab (earth) and other mah\xc4\x81bh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xadas (primordial\nelements, as pas or water, agni or fire, v\xc4\x81yu or air, and \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b). (In the\nbody), that which is hard is (of the essence of) earth; that which is liquid\nis (of the essence of) water; that which is hot is (of the essence of) fire;\nthat which moves about is (of the essence of) v\xc4\x81yu; that which is perforated\nis (of the essence of) \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b. The ear and others are the j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81nen\xe1\xb8\x8driyas (organs\nof sense). The ear is of the essence of \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, the skin of the essence of v\xc4\x81yu,\nthe eye of the essence of fire, the tongue of the essence of water, and the\nnose of the essence of earth; sound, touch, form, taste, and odour being\nrespectively the objects of perception for these organs. These arose\nrespectively out of the primordial elements, beginning with earth. The mouth,\nthe hands, the legs, the organs of excretion and the organs of generation are\nthe karmen\xe1\xb8\x8driyas (or organs of action). Their functions are respectively\ntalking, lifting, walking, excretion, and enjoyment. An\xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb8\xa5kara\xe1\xb9\x87a (or the\ninternal organ) is of four kinds--manas, bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi, aha\xe1\xb9\x85k\xc4\x81ra, and chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada. Their\nfunctions are respectively sa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpa-vikalpa, (or will-thought and doubt),\ndetermination, egoism, and memory. The seat of manas is the end of the throat,\nthat of bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi the face, that of aha\xe1\xb9\x85k\xc4\x81ra the heart, and that of chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada the\nnavel. The bone, skin, n\xc4\x81dis, nerves, hair, and flesh are of the essence of\nearth. Urine,\n\np. 114\n\nphlegm, blood, \xc5\x9bukla (or sperm), and sweat are of the essence of water.\nHunger, thirst, sloth, delusion, and (desire of) copulation are of the essence\nof fire. Walking, scratching, opening and closing the gross eyes, etc., are of\nthe essence of v\xc4\x81yu. Desire, anger, avarice, delusion, and fear are of the\nessence of \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b. Sound, touch, form, taste, and odour are the properties of\nearth: sound, touch, form, and taste are the properties of water: sound,\ntouch, and form, are the properties of fire: sound and touch are the\nproperties of v\xc4\x81yu: sound alone is the property of \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b. There are three gu\xe1\xb9\x87as\n(or qualities), s\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadvika, r\xc4\x81jasa, and \xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81masa. Non-killing, veracity, not\nstealing, continence, non-covetousness, refraining from anger, serving the\nguru, purity (in mind and body), contentment, right conduct, abstinence from\nself-praise, freedom from pompousness, firm conviction in the existence of\nGod, and not causing any injury to others--all these are to be known as\ns\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadvika-gu\xe1\xb9\x87as chiefly. I am the actor, I am the enjoyer, I am the speaker,\nand I am the egoistic--such are said by knowers of Brahman to be r\xc4\x81jasa-gu\xe1\xb9\x87as.\nSleep, sloth, delusion, desire, copulation, and theft are said by expounders\nof the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das to be \xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81masa-gu\xe1\xb9\x87as. Those having sa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva-gu\xe1\xb9\x87a (go) up ( _viz_., to\nhigher spheres)--those having r\xc4\x81jasa-gu\xe1\xb9\x87a (stay) in the middle ( _viz_., the\nsphere of earth)--those having \xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81masa-gu\xe1\xb9\x87a (go) down ( _viz_., to hell, etc.).\nPerfect (or divine) knowledge is of s\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadvika-gu\xe1\xb9\x87a; knowledge of \xe1\xb8\x8dharma is of\nr\xc4\x81jasa-gu\xe1\xb9\x87a, and mental darkness is of \xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81masa. J\xc4\x81gra\xe1\xb9\xada (waking state), svapna\n(dreaming state), sushup\xe1\xb9\xadi (dreamless sleeping state), and \xe1\xb9\xadurya (the fourth\nstate beyond these three) are the four states. J\xc4\x81gra\xe1\xb9\xada is (the state) having\n(the play of) the fourteen organs, the organs of sense (five), the organs of\naction (five), and the four internal organs. Svapna is (the state) associated\nwith the four internal organs. Sushup\xe1\xb9\xadi is (the state) where the chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada is the\nonly organ. \xe1\xb9\xacurya is that state having j\xc4\xabva alone. Regarding j\xc4\xabv\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 and\nParam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 (enjoying the three states) of a person with opened eyes, with\nclosed eyes, and with eyes in an intermediate state with neither, j\xc4\xabva is said\nto be the Kshe\xe1\xb9\xadraj\xc3\xb1a (the lord of the body). The organs of sense\n\np. 115\n\n[paragraph continues] (five), the organs of action (five), pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as (five),\nmanas, and bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi--all these seventeen are said to constitute the s\xc5\xabkshma or\nli\xe1\xb9\x85ga ( _viz_., subtle) body. Manas, bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi, aha\xe1\xb9\x85k\xc4\x81ra, \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, v\xc4\x81yu, fire,\nwater, and earth--these are the eight prak\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadis (or matter): ear, skin, eye,\ntongue, nose the fifth, the organs of excretion, the organs of secretion,\nhands, legs, speech the tenth, sound, form, touch, taste, and odour are the\nfifteen modifications (of the above eight prak\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadis). Therefore the \xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadvas are\ntwenty-three. The twenty-fourth is avyak\xe1\xb9\xada (the undifferentiated matter) or\npra\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81na. Purusha is other than (or superior to) this. Thus is the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[113:1](tmu17.htm#fr_75) This Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d treats of Sar\xc4\xabra or the body.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 16.
