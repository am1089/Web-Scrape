 \nAround his loving heart they clung  \nLike arms from his own body sprung. 2  \nBut best and noblest of the four,  \nGood as the God whom all adore,  \nLord of all virtues, undefiled,  \nHis darling was his eldest child.  \nFor he was beautiful and strong,  \nFrom envy free, the foe of wrong,  \nWith all his father's virtues blest,  \nAnd peerless in the world confessed.  \nWith placid soul he softly spoke:  \nNo harsh reply could taunts provoke.  \nHe ever loved the good and sage  \nRevered for virtue and for age,  \nAnd when his martial tasks were o'er  \nSate listening to their peaceful lore.  \nWise, modest, pure, he honoured eld,  \nHis lips from lying tales withheld;  \nDue reference to the Brahnmans gave,  \nAnd ruled each passion like a slave.  \nMost tender, prompt at duty's call,  \nLoved by all men he loved them all.  \nProud of the duties of his race,  \nWith spirit meet for Warrior's place,  \nHe strove to win by glorious deed,  \nThroned with the Gods, a priceless meed.  \n\nWith him in speech and quick reply  \nVrihaspati might hardly vie,  \nBut never would his accents flow  \nFor evil or for empty show.  \nIn art and science duly trained,  \nHis student vow he well maintained;  \nHe learnt the lore for princes fit,  \nThe Vedas and their Holy Writ,  \nAnd with his well-drawn bow at last  \nHis mighty father's fame surpassed.  \nOf birth exalted, truthful, just,  \nWith vigorous hand, with noble trust,  \nWell taught by aged twice-born men  \nWho gain and right could clearly ken,  \nFull well the claims and bounds he knew  \nOf duty, gain, and pleasure too:  \nOf memory keen, of ready tact,  \nIn civil business prompt to act.  \nReserved, his features ne'er disclosed  \nWhat counsel in his heart reposed.  \nAll idle rage and mirth controlled,  \nHe knew the times to give and hold,  \nFirm in his faith, of steadfast will,  \nHe sought no wrong, he spoke no ill:  \nNot rashly swift, not idly slow,  \nHis faults and others' keen to know.  \nEach merit, by his subtle sense,  \nHe matched with proper recompense.  \nHe knew the means that wealth provide,  \nAnd with keen eye expense could guide.  \nWild elephants could he reclaim,  \nAnd mettled steeds could mount and tame.  \nNo arm like his the bow could wield,  \nOr drive the chariot to the field.  \nSkilled to attack, to deal the blow,  \nOr lead a host against the foe:  \nYea, e'en infuriate Gods would fear  \nTo meet his arm in full career.  \nAs the great sun in noontide blaze  \nIs glorious with his world of rays.  \nSo Rama with these virtues shone  \nWhich all men loved to gaze upon.  \n\nThe aged monarch fain would rest,  \nAnd said within his weary breast,  \n'Oh that I might, while living yet,  \nMy Rama o'er the kingdom set.  \nAnd see, before my course be run,  \nThe hallowed drops anoint my son;  \nSee all this spacious land obey,  \nFrom side to side, my first-born's sway,  \nAnd then, my life and joy complete,  \nObtain in heaven a blissful seat!'  \nIn him the monarch saw combined  \nThe fairest form, the noblest mind,  \nAnd counselled how his son might share,  \nThe throne with him as Regent Heir.  \nFor fearful signs in earth and sky,  \nAnd weakness warned him death was nigh:  \nBut Rama to the world endeared  \nBy every grace his bosom cheered,  \n\np. 90  \n\nThe moon of every eye, whose ray  \nDrove all his grief and fear away.  \nSo duty urged that hour to seize,  \nHimself, his realm, to bless and please.  \n\nFrom town and country, far and near,  \nHe summoned people, prince, and peer.  \nTo each he gave a meet abode,  \nAnd honoured all and gifts bestowed.  \nThen, splendid in his king's attire,  \nHe viewed them, as the general Sire,  \nIn glory of a God arrayed,  \nLooks on the creatures he has made.  \nBut Kekaya's king he called not then  \nFor haste, nor Janak, lord of men;  \nFor after to each royal friend  \nThe joyful tidings he would send.  \nMid crowds from distant countries met  \nThe king upon his throne was set;  \nThen honoured by the people, all  \nThe rulers thronged into the hall.  \nOn thrones assigned, each king in place  \nLooked silent on the monarch's face.  \n   Then girt by lords of high renown  \n   And throngs from hamlet and from town  \n     He showed in regal pride,  \nAs, honoured by the radiant band  \nOf blessed Gods that round him stand,  \nLord Indra, Thousand-eyed.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[89:1](ry079.htm#fr_258) S'atrughna means slayer of foes, and the word is\nrepeated as an intensive epithet.\n\n[89:2](ry079.htm#fr_259) Alluding to the images of Vishnu, which have four\narms, the four princes being portions of the substance of that God.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto II.: The People's Speech.](ry080.htm)\n\n"
