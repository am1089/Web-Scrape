If you say, as in the case of the organs; we deny this, on account of\nenjoyment and so on.\n\nIt may possibly be said that, in the same way as the enjoying (individual)\nsoul, although in itself without a body, is seen to rule the sense-organs, the\nbody, and so on, the great Lord also, although without a body, may rule the\nPradhana. But this analogy cannot be allowed 'on account of enjoyment,' and so\non. The body's being ruled by the soul is due to the unseen principle in the\nform of good and evil works, and has for its end the requital of those works.\nYour analogy would thus imply that the Lord also is under the influence of an\nunseen principle, and is requited for his good and evil works.--The Lord\ncannot therefore be a ruler.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 39.
