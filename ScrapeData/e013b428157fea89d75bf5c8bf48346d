XXI.\n\nFamilies of the Daityas. Descendants of Ka\xc5\x9byapa by Danu. Children of Ka\xc5\x9byapa\nby his other wives. Birth of the Marutas, the sons of Diti.\n\nTHE sons of Sanhrada, the son of Hiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu, were \xc3\x81yushman, \xc5\x9aivi, and\nVashkala 1. Prahlada had a son named Virochana; whose son was Bali, who had a\nhundred sons, of whom Ban\xcc\x81a was the eldest 2.\n\nHiran\xcc\x81yaksha also had many sons, all of whom were Daityas of great prowess;\nJharjhara, \xc5\x9aakuni, Bhutasantapana, Mahanabha, the mighty-armed and the valiant\nTaraka. These were the sons of Diti 3.\n\nThe children of Ka\xc5\x9byapa by Danu were Dwimurddha, \xc5\x9aankara, Ayomukha,\n\xc5\x9aanku\xc5\x9biras, Kapila, Samvara, Ekachakra, and another mighty Taraka, Swarbhanu,\nVrishaparvan, Puloman, and the powerful Viprachitti; these were the renowned\nDanavas, or sons of Danu 4.\n\nSwarbhanu had a daughter named Prabha 5; and \xc5\x9aarmisht\xcc\x81ha 6 was the daughter of\nVrishaparvan, as were Upadanavi and Haya\xc5\x9bira 7.\n\np. 148\n\nVaiswanara 8 had two daughters, Puloma and Kalika, who were both married to\nKa\xc5\x9byapa, and bore him sixty thousand distinguished Danavas, called Paulomas\nand Kalakanjas 9, who were powerful, ferocious, and cruel.\n\nThe sons of Viprachitti by Sinhika (the sister of Hiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu) were Vyan\xc5\x9ba,\n\xc5\x9aalya the strong, Nabha the powerful, Vatapi, Namuchi, Ilwala, Khasrima,\nAnjaka, Naraka, and Kalanabha, the valiant Swarbhanu, and the mighty\nVaktrayodhi 10. These were the most eminent Danavas 11, through whom the race\nof Danu was multiplied by hundreds and thousands through succeeding\ngenerations.\n\nIn the family of the Daitya Prahlada, the Nivata Kavachas were born, whose\nspirits were purified by rigid austerity 12.\n\nTamra (the wife of Ka\xc5\x9byapa) had six illustrious daughters, named \xc5\x9auki, \xc5\x9ayeni,\nBhasi, Sugrivi, \xc5\x9auchi, and Gridhrika. \xc5\x9auki gave birth to parrots, owls, and\ncrows 13; \xc5\x9ayeni to hawks; Bhasi to kites; Gridhrika\n\np. 149\n\nto vultures; \xc5\x9auchi to water-fowl; Sugrivi to horses, camels, and asses. Such\nwere the progeny of Tamra.\n\nVinata bore to Ka\xc5\x9byapa two celebrated sons, Garud\xcc\x81a and Arun\xcc\x81a: the former,\nalso called Suparn\xcc\x81a, was the king of the feathered tribes, and the\nremorseless enemy of the serpent race 14.\n\nThe children of Surasa were a thousand mighty many-headed serpents, traversing\nthe sky 15.\n\nThe progeny of Kadru were a thousand powerful many-headed serpents, of\nimmeasurable might, subject to Garud\xcc\x81a; the chief amongst whom were \xc5\x9aesha,\nVasuki, Takshaka, \xc5\x9aankha, \xc5\x9aweta, Mahapadma, Kambala, \xc3\x81swatara, Elapatra, Naga,\nKarkkota, Dhananjaya, and many other fierce and venomous serpents 16.\n\nThe family of Krodhavasa were all sharp-toothed monsters 17, whether on the\nearth, amongst the birds, or in the waters, that were devourers of flesh.\n\np. 150\n\n 18Surabhi was the mother of cows and buffaloes 19: Ira, of trees and creeping\nplants and shrubs, and every kind of grass: Khasa, of the Rakshasas and\nYakshas 20: Muni, of the Apsarasas 21: and Arisht\xcc\x81a, of the illustrious\nGandharbas.\n\nThese were the children of Ka\xc5\x9byapa, whether movable or stationary, whose\ndescendants multiplied infinitely through successive generations 22. This\ncreation, oh Brahman, took place in the second or Swarochisha Manwantara. In\nthe present or Vaivaswata Manwantara, Brahma being engaged at the great\nsacrifice instituted by Varun\xcc\x81a, the creation of progeny, as it is called,\noccurred; for he begot, as his sons, the seven Rishis, who were formerly mind-\nengendered; and was himself the grand-sire of the Gandharbas, serpents,\nDanavas, and gods 23.\n\np. 151\n\nDiti, having lost her children, propitiated Ka\xc5\x9byapa; and the best of ascetics,\nbeing pleased with her, promised her a boon; on which she prayed for a son of\nirresistible prowess and valour, who should destroy Indra. The excellent Muni\ngranted his wife the great gift she had solicited, but with one condition:\n"You shall bear a son," he said, "who shall slay Indra, if with thoughts\nwholly pious, and person entirely pure, you carefully carry the babe in your\nwomb for a hundred years." Having thus said, Ka\xc5\x9byapa departed; and the dame\nconceived, and during gestation assiduously observed the rules of mental and\npersonal purity. When the king of the immortals, learnt that Diti bore a son\ndestined for his destruction, he came to her, and attended upon her with the\nutmost humility, watching for an opportunity to disappoint her intention. At\nlast, in the last year of the century, the opportunity occurred. Diti\n\np. 152\n\nretired one night to rest without performing the prescribed ablution of her\nfeet, and fell asleep; on which the thunderer divided with his thunderbolt the\nembryo in her womb into seven portions. The child, thus mutilated, cried\nbitterly; and Indra repeatedly attempted to console and silence it, but in\nvain: on which the god, being incensed, again divided each of the seven\nportions into seven, and thus formed the swift-moving deities called Marutas\n(winds). They derived this appellation from the words with which Indra had\naddressed them (Ma rodih, \'Weep not\'); and they became forty-nine subordinate\ndivinities, the associates of the wielder of the thunderbolt 24.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[147:1](vp056.htm#fr_329) The Padma P. makes these the sons of Prahlada. The\nBhagavata says there were five sons, but does not give the names. It also\ninserts the sons of Hlada, making them the celebrated demons Ilwala and\nVatapi. The Vayu refers to Hlada, other Daityas, famous in Pauran\xcc\x81ic legend,\nmaking his son, Nisunda; and his sons, Sunda and Upasunda; the former the\nfather of Maricha and Taraka; the latter, of Muka.\n\n[147:2](vp056.htm#fr_330) The Padma P. and Vayu name several of these, but\nthey are not of any note: the latter gives the names of two daughters, who are\nmore celebrated, Putana and \xc5\x9aakuni.\n\n[147:3](vp056.htm#fr_331) The descendants of Hiran\xcc\x81yaksha are said, in the\nPadma P., to have extended to seventy-seven crores, or seven hundred and\nseventy millions. Some copies, for Taraka, read Kalanabha.\n\n[147:4](vp056.htm#fr_332) The Padma and Vayu P. furnish a much longer list of\nnames, but those of most note are the same as in the text, with which also the\nBhagavata for the most part agrees.\n\n[147:5](vp056.htm#fr_333) The Bhagavata makes Prabha the wife of Namuchi:\naccording to the Vayu, she is the mother of Nahusha.\n\n[147:6](vp056.htm#fr_334) Married to Yayati, as will be related.\n\n[147:7](vp056.htm#fr_335) The text might be understood to imply that the\nlatter two were the daughters of Vaiswanara; and the Bhagavata has, "The four\nlovely daughters of Vaiswanara were Upadanavi, Haya\xc5\x9biras, Puloma, and Kalaka."\nThe Padma substitutes Vajra and Sundari for the two former names. The Vayu\nspecifies only Puloma and Kalika as the daughters of Vaiswanara, as does our\ntext. Upadanavi, according to the Bhagavata, is the wife of Hiran\xcc\x81yaksha; and\nHaya\xc5\x9biras, of Kratu.\n\n[148:8](vp056.htm#fr_336) Though not specified by the text as one of the\nDanavas, he is included in the catalogue of the Vayu, and the commentator on\nthe Bhagavata calls him a son of Danu.\n\n[148:9](vp056.htm#fr_337) The word is also read Kulakas and Kalakeyas: the\nMahabharata, I. 643, has Kalakanjas.\n\n[148:10](vp056.htm#fr_338) The text omits the two most celebrated of the\nSainhikeyas, or sons of Sinhika, Rahu (see [p. 78](vp044.htm#page_78). note\n[8](vp044.htm#fn_236)) and Ketu, who are specified both in the Bhagavata and\nthe Vayu; the former as the eldest son. Of the other sons it is said by the\nVayu that they were all killed by Para\xc5\x9burama.\n\n[148:11](vp056.htm#fr_339) Two names of note, found in the Vayu, are omitted\nby the Vishn\xcc\x81u; that of Puloman, the father of \xc5\x9aachi, the wife of Indra, and\nmother of Jayanta; and Maya, the father of Vajrakama and Mahodari.\n\n[148:12](vp056.htm#fr_340) The Bhagavata says the Paulomas were killed by\nArjuna, who therefore, the commentator observes, were the same as the Nivata\nKavachas: but the Mahabharata describes the destruction of the Nivata Kavachas\nand of the Paulomas and Kalakeyas as the successive exploits of Arjuna. Vana\nP. 8. I. 633. The story is narrated in detail only in the Mahabharata, which\nis consequently prior to all the Puran\xcc\x81as in which the allusion occurs.\nAccording to that work, the Nivata Kavachas were Danavas, to the number of\nthirty millions, residing in the depths of the sea; and the Paulomas and\nKalakanjas were the children of two Daitya dames, Puloma and Kalaka,\ninhabiting Hiranyapura, the golden city, floating in the air.\n\n[148:13](vp056.htm#fr_341) All the copies read ### which should be, \'\xc5\x9auki bore\nparrots; and Uluki, the several sorts of owls? but Uluki is nowhere named as\none of the daughters of Tamra; and the reading may be, \'Owls p. 149 and birds\nopposed to owls, i. e. crows. The authorities generally concur with our text;\nbut the Vayu has a somewhat different account; or, \xc5\x9auki, married to Garud\xcc\x81a,\nthe mother of parrots: \xc5\x9ayeni, married to Arun\xcc\x81a, mother of Sampati and\nJat\xcc\x81ayu: Bhasi, the mother of jays, owls, crows, peacocks, pigeons, and fowls:\nKraunchi, the parent of curlews, herons, cranes: and Dhritarashtri, the mother\nof geese, ducks, teal, and other water-fowl. The three last are also called\nthe wives of Garud\xcc\x81a.\n\n[149:14](vp056.htm#fr_342) Most of the Puran\xcc\x81as agree in this account; but the\nBhagavata makes Vinata the wife of Tarksha, and in this place substitutes\nSarama, the mother of wild animals. The Vayu adds the metres of the Vedas as\nthe daughters of Vinata; and the Padma gives her one daughter Saudamini.\n\n[149:15](vp056.htm#fr_343) The dragons of modern fable. Anayush or Danayush is\nsubstituted for Surasa in the Vayu, and in one of the accounts of the Padma.\nThe Bhagavata says Rakshasas were her offspring. The Matsya has both Surasa\nand Anayush, making the former the parent of all quadrupeds, except cows; the\nlatter, the mother of diseases.\n\n[149:16](vp056.htm#fr_344) The Vayu names forty: the most noted amongst whom,\nin addition to those of the text, are Airavata, Dhritarasht\xcc\x81ra, Mahanila,\nBalahaka, Anjana, Pushpadansht\xcc\x81ra, Durmukha, Kaliya, Pun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81arika, Kapila,\nNahusha, and Man\xcc\x81i.\n\n[149:17](vp056.htm#fr_345) By Dansht\xcc\x81rin\xcc\x81a some understand, serpents, some\nRakshasas; but by the context carnivorous animals, birds, and fishes seem\nintended. The Vayu makes Krodhava\xc5\x9ba the mother of twelve daughters, Mrigi and\nothers, from whom all wild animals, deer, elephants, monkeys, tigers, lions,\ndogs, also fishes, reptiles, and Bhutas and Pi\xc5\x9bachas, or goblins, sprang.\n\n[150:18](vp056.htm#fr_346) One copy only inserts a half stanza here; "Krodha\nwas the mother of the Pi\xc5\x9bachas;" which is an interpolation apparently from the\nMatsya or Hari Van\xc5\x9ba. The Padma P., second legend, makes Krodha the mother of\nthe Bhutas; and Pi\xc5\x9bacha, of the Pi\xc5\x9bachas.\n\n[150:19](vp056.htm#fr_347) The Bhagavata says, of animals with cloven hoofs.\nThe Vayu has, of the eleven Rudras, of the bull of \xc5\x9aiva, and of two daughters,\nRohin\xcc\x81i and Gandharbi; from the former of whom descended horned cattle; and\nfrom the latter, horses.\n\n[150:20](vp056.htm#fr_348) According to the Vayu, Khasa had two sons, Yaksha\nand Rakshas, severally the progenitors of those beings.\n\n[150:21](vp056.htm#fr_349) The Padma, second series, makes Vach the mother of\nboth Apsarasas and Gandharbas: the Vayu has long lists of the names of both\nclasses, as well as of Vidyadharas and Kinnaras. The Apsarasas are\ndistinguished as of two kinds, Laukika, \'worldly,\' of whom thirty-four are\nspecified; and Daivika, or \'divine,\' ten in number: the latter furnish the\nindividuals most frequently engaged in the interruption of the penances of\nholy sages, such as Menaka, Sahajanya, Ghritachi, Pramlocha, Viswachi, and\nPurvachitti. Urva\xc5\x9bi is of a different order to both, being the daughter of\nNarayan\xcc\x81a. Rambha, Tilotama Misrake\xc5\x9bi, are included amongst the Laukika\nnymphs. There are also fourteen Gan\xcc\x81as, or troops, of Apsarasas, bearing\npeculiar designations, as \xc3\x81hutas, Sobhayantis, Vegavatis, &c.\n\n[150:22](vp056.htm#fr_350) The Kurma, Matsya, Brahma, Linga, Agni, Padma, and\nVayu Puran\xcc\x81as agree generally with our text in the description of Ka\xc5\x9byapa\'s\nwives and progeny. The Vayu enters most into details, and contains very long\ncatalogues of the names of the different characters descended from the sage.\nThe Padma and Matsya and the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba repeat the story, but admit several\nvariations, some of which have been adverted to in the preceding notes.\n\n[150:23](vp056.htm#fr_351) We have a considerable variation here in the\ncommentary, and it may be doubted if the allusion in the text is accurately\nexplained by either of the versions. In one it is said that \'Brahma, the\ngrandsire of p. 151 the Gandharbas, &c., appointed the seven Rishis, who were\nborn in a former Manwantara, to be his sons, or to be the intermediate agents\nin creation: he created no other beings himself, being engrossed by the\nsacrificial ceremony.\' Instead of "putratwe," \'in the state of sons,\' the\nreading is sometimes "pitratwe," \'in the character of fathers;\' that is, to\nall other beings. Thus the gods and the rest, who in a former Manwantara\noriginated from Ka\xc5\x9byapa, were created in the present period as the offspring\nof the seven Rishis. The other explanation agrees with the preceding in\nascribing the birth of all creatures to the intermediate agency of the seven\nRishis, but calls them the actual sons of Brahma, begotten at the sacrifice of\nVanilla, in the sacrificial fire. The authority for the story is not given,\nbeyond its being in other Puran\xcc\x81as, it has the air of a modern mystification.\nThe latter member of the passage is separated altogether from the foregoing,\nand carried on to what follows: thus; "In the war of the Gandharbas, serpents,\ngods, and demons, Diti having lost her children," &c.; the word \'virodha\'\nbeing understood, it is said, This is defended by the authority of the Hari\nVan\xc5\x9ba, where the passage occurs word for word, except in the last half stanza,\nwhich, instead of ### occurs ###. The parallel passages are thus rendered by\nM. Langlois: \'Le Mouni Swarotchicha avoit cesse de regner quand cette creation\neut lieu: c\'etait sous l\'empire du Menou Vevaswata le sacrifice de Varouna\navait commence. La premiere creation fut celle de Brahma, quand il jugea qu\'il\netait temps de proceder a son sacrifice, et que, souverain aieul du monde, il\nforma lui-meme dans sa pensee et enfanta les sept Brahmarchis.\'\n\n[152:24](vp056.htm#fr_352) This legend occurs in all those Puran\xcc\x81as in which\nthe account of Ka\xc5\x9byapa\'s family is related.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXII](vp057.htm)\n\n'
