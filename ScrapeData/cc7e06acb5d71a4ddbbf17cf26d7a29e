I will go and take\nthe cows to feed; do you prevail on my father to send me with the cowherds."\nHearing this, Jusodha spoke to Nund Jee on the subject. He having fixed upon a\nlucky division of time, equal to forty-eight minutes, sent for the cowherds\'\nchildren; and on the eighth of the light part of the month Kartik, having\ncaused Krishnu to perform poojah to a cowshed, he said in a supplicating\nmariner to the cowherds, "Brothers! from to-day, take Ram Krishnu with you,\nwhen you take the cows to pasture: but stay near him, and do not leave him\nalone in the jungle." Having thus said, and given them food, and marked\nKrishnu and Bulram on the forehead with coagulated milk, he dismissed them in\ncompany with all the rest. They were delighted, and went to the jungle with\nthe cowherds\' children and the cows. There, on beholding the beauty of the\njungle, Shree Krishnu began to say to Buldeo, "Buldeo! this is a very\npleasant, agreeable place; see, how the trees are bending under the weight of\ntheir branches, and beasts and birds of various kinds, sporting in every\ndirection!"\n\np. 69\n\nWhen he had thus spoken, they ascended a high hillock, and began waiving white\ncloths over their heads, to call out to the cows of different colours, viz.\nblack, white, yellow, purple, brown, blue. On hearing their voices, they all\ncame running up, lowing and panting. At this time there was an appearance of\nsuch beauty, that it seemed as if clouds of different colours had been\ncollected from the four quarters. After this, Shree Krishnu Chund having\ndriven away the cows to feed, and having eaten his meal with his brother, went\nto sleep under the shade of a kudum tree, placing, his head on the thigh of a\ncompanion. Having awoke after some time, he said to Bulram, "Let us play this\ngame: let us fight together, each arranging a separate army in battle order."\nWhen he had thus spoken, they divided the cows and cowherds\' children into two\nequal portions; then gathering fruits and flowers from the jungle and filling\nwallets with them, they began to play upon different kinds of martial\ninstruments, and engaging with each other, to call out. They fought in this\nmanner for some time, and then having taken their divisions apart, they began\nto tend upon the cows (that is, take them to pasture.)\n\nAt this time, one of his companions said to Buldeo Jee, "O great king! at a\nshort distance from this, there is a palm jungle, in which there are fruits,\nequal in flavour to nectar; an evil spirit in the shape of an ass keeps guard\nthere." On hearing this, Bulram Jee went into that jungle with the cowherds\'\nchildren and began knocking down the fruits by throwing bricks, stones, clods\nand sticks. Having heard the noise, the ass, whose name was Dhenook, came\nbraying to the spot; and on coming up, he turned round and kicked Buldeo Jee\ntwice on the chest: upon which, having taken him up, Buldeo dashed him on the\nground. After roiling about, the ass again got up; and pawing the ground, and\nputting his ears down, he began to go back, and continue kicking with both\nhind legs. He continued fighting in this manner for some time. On a sudden\nBulram Jee having seized both\n\np. 60\n\nhis hind legs, and twisting them round, threw him upon a high tree, from which\nhe fell down dead: and with him the tree fell also, broken in pieces. There\nwas a very loud noise in consequence of the fall of both, and all the trees of\nthe forest were shaken. Having beheld from a distance, Krishnu said, "The\ntrees have been shaken, and there has been a great noise." A friend of\nBuldeo\'s came, (and said) "Come quickly Krishnu, Buldeo has sent for you: A\ndemon has been killed, and is lying on the ground." On hearing this, Shree\nKrishnu went also to Bulram. Then all the demons, who were companions of\nDhenook, came and attacked him. Shree Krishnu Chund easily destroyed them all.\nThen the cowherds\' children being delighted and plucking the fruit without\nfear, filled as many baskets as they wished; and having brought all the cows\ntogether, they said to Shree Krishnu and Buldeo Jee, "O great kings! it is\nvery long since we calve here, let us now go home." On hearing this, both\nbrothers, taking the cows with them, came home laughing and playing with the\ncowherds\' children in the evening, and distributed the fruits they brought\nthroughout the whole of Brindabun. Having dismissed all their friends and\ncompanions they went to sleep. In the morning they rose very early, and\nKrishnu having called the cowherds\' children, and giving them breakfast,\ntaking the cows with him, went to the jungle; and whilst feeding the cows,\nthey came to the whirlpool where the serpent Kalee lived--there the cowherds\nwatered the cows in the Jumna, and drank some water themselves. When they got\nup after having drank the water, they, as well as the cows, began rolling on\nthe ground, in consequence of the poison. Upon this, Shree Krishnu having\nlooked at them with an immortal glance, (a glance like nectar,) restored them\nall to life.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XVII](psa18.htm)\n\n'
