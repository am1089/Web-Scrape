And as the (atomic theory) is not accepted (by any authoritative persons)\nit is to be disregarded altogether.\n\nWhile the theory of the pradhana being the cause of the world has been\naccepted by some adherents of the Veda--as, for instance, Manu--with a view to\nthe doctrines of the effect existing in the cause already, and so on, the\natomic doctrine has not been accepted by any persons of authority in any of\nits parts, and therefore is to be disregarded entirely by all those who take\ntheir stand on the Veda.\n\nThere are, moreover, other objections to the Vai _s_ eshika doctrine.--The Vai\n_s_ eshikas assume six categories, which constitute the subject-matter of\ntheir system, viz. substance, quality, action, generality, particularity, and\ninherence. These six categories they maintain to be absolutely different from\neach other, and to have different characteristics;\n\np. 395\n\njust as a man, a horse, a hare differ from one another. Side by side with this\nassumption they make another which contradicts the former one, viz. that\nquality, action, &c. have the attribute of depending on substance. But that is\naltogether inappropriate; for just as ordinary things, such as animals, grass,\ntrees, and the like, being absolutely different from each other do not depend\non each other, so the qualities, &c. also being absolutely different from\nsubstance, cannot depend on the latter. Or else let the qualities, &c. depend\non substance; then it follows that, as they are present where substance is\npresent, and absent where it is absent, substance only exists, and, according\nto its various forms, becomes the object of different terms and conceptions\n(such as quality, action, &c.); just as Devadatta, for instance, according to\nthe conditions in which he finds himself is the object of various conceptions\nand names. But this latter alternative would involve the acceptation of the Sa\n_n_ khya doctrine 1 and the abandonment of the Vai _s_ eshika standpoint.--But\n(the Vai _s_ eshika may say) smoke also is different from fire and yet it is\ndependent on it.--True, we reply; but we ascertain the difference of smoke and\nfire from the fact of their being apperceived in separation. Substance and\nquality, on the other hand, are not so apperceived; for when we are conscious\nof a white blanket, or a red cow, or a blue lotus, the substance is in each\ncase cognised by means of the quality; the latter therefore has its Self in\nthe substance. The same reasoning applies to action, generality,\nparticularity, and inherence.\n\nIf you (the Vai _s_ eshika) say that qualities, actions, &c. (although not\nnon-different from substances) may yet depend on the latter because substances\nand qualities stand in the relation of one not being able to exist without the\nother (ayutasiddhi 2); we point out that things which are\n\np. 396\n\nayutasiddha must either be non-separate in place, or non-separate in time, or\nnon-separate in nature, and that none of these alternatives agrees with Vai\n_s_ eshika principles. For the first alternative contradicts your own\nassumptions according to which the cloth originating from the threads occupies\nthe place of the threads only, not that of the cloth, while the qualities of\nthe cloth, such as its white colour, occupy the place of the cloth only, not\nthat of the threads. So the Vai _s_ eshika-sutras say (I, 1, 10), 'Substances\noriginate another substance and qualities another quality.' The threads which\nconstitute the causal substance originate the effected substance, viz. the\ncloth, and the qualities of the threads, such as white colour, &c., produce in\nthe cloth new corresponding qualities. But this doctrine is clearly\ncontradicted by the assumption of substance and quality being non-separate in\nplace--If, in the second place, you explain ayutasiddhatva as non-separation\nin time, it follows also that, for instance, the right and the left horn of a\ncow would be ayutasiddha.--And if, finally, you explain it to mean 'non-\nseparation in character,' it is impossible to make any further distinction\nbetween the substance and the quality, as then quality is conceived as being\nidentical with substance.\n\nMoreover, the distinction which the Vai _s_ eshikas make between conjunction\n(sa _m_ yoga) as being the connexion of things which can exist separately, and\ninherence (samavaya) as being the connexion of things which are incapable of\nseparate existence is futile, since the cause which exists before the effect 1\ncannot be said to be incapable of separate existence. Perhaps the Vai _s_\neshika will say that his definition refers to one of the two terms only, so\nthat samavaya is the connexion, with the cause, of the effect which is\nincapable of separate existence. But this also is of no avail; for as a\nconnexion requires two terms, the effect as long as it has not yet entered\ninto being cannot be connected with the cause. And it would be equally\nunavailing to say that the effect enters into the connexion after it has begun\nto exist; for if the Vai _s_ eshika admits that the effect\n\np. 397\n\nmay exist previous to its connexion with the cause, it is no longer\nayutasiddha (incapable of separate existence), and thereby the principle that\nbetween effect and cause conjunction and disjunction do not take place is\nviolated. 1 And  2 just as conjunction, and not samavaya, is the connexion in\nwhich every effected substance as soon as it has been produced stands with the\nall-pervading substances as ether, &c.--although no motion has taken place on\nthe part of the effected substance--so also the connexion of the effect with\nthe cause will be conjunction merely, not samavaya.\n\nNor is there any proof for the existence of any connexion, samavaya or sa _m_\nyoga, apart from the things which it connects. If it should be maintained that\nsa _m_ yoga and samavaya have such an existence because we observe that there\nare names and ideas of them in addition to the names and ideas of the things\nconnected, we point out that one and the same thing may be the subject of\nseveral names and ideas if it is considered in its relations to what lies\nwithout it. Devadatta although being one only forms the object of many\ndifferent names and notions according as he is considered in himself or in his\nrelations to others; thus he is thought and spoken of as man, Brahma _n_ a\nlearned in the Veda, generous, boy, young man, old man, father, son, grandson,\nbrother, son-in-law. &c. So, again, one and the same stroke is, according to\nthe place it is connected with, spoken of and conceived as meaning either ten,\nor hundred, or thousand, &c. Analogously, two connected things are not only\nconceived and denoted as connected things, but in addition constitute the\nobject of the ideas and terms 'conjunction' or 'inherence' which however do\nnot prove\n\np. 398\n\nthemselves to be separate entities.--Things standing thus, the non-existence\nof separate entities (conjunction, &c.), which entities would have to be\nestablished on the ground of perception, follows from the fact of their non-\nperception.\n\nNor, again  1, does the circumstance of the word and idea of connexion having\nfor its object the things connected involve the connexion's permanent\nexistence, since we have already shown above that one thing may, on account of\nits relations to other things, be conceived and denoted in different ways.\n\nFurther  2, conjunction cannot take place between the atoms, the soul, and the\ninternal organ, because they have no parts; for we observe that conjunction\ntakes place only of such substances as consist of parts. If the Vai _s_ eshika\nshould say that parts of the atoms, soul and mind may be assumed (in order to\nexplain their alleged conjunction), we remark that the assumption of actually\nnon-existing things would involve the result that anything might be\nestablished; for there is no restrictive rule that only such and such non-\nexisting things--whether contradictory to reason or not--should be assumed and\nnot any other, and assumptions depend on one's choice only and may be carried\nto any extent. If we once allow assumptions, there is no reason why there\nshould not be assumed a further hundred or thousand things, in addition to the\nsix categories assumed by the Vai _s_ eshikas. Anybody might then assume\nanything, and we could neither stop a compassionate man from assuming that\nthis transmigratory world which is the cause of so much misery to living\nbeings is not to be, nor a malicious man from assuming that even the released\nsouls are to enter on a new cycle of existences.\n\np. 399\n\nFurther, it is not possible that a binary atomic compound, which consists of\nparts, should be connected with the simple indivisible atoms by an intimate\nconnexion (sa _ms_ lesha) any more than they can thus be connected with ether;\nfor between ether and earth, &c. there does not exist that kind of intimate\nconnexion which exists, for instance, between wood and varnish 1.\n\nLet it then be said (the Vai _s_ eshika resumes) that the samavaya relation\nmust be assumed, because otherwise the relation of that which abides and that\nwhich forms the abode--which relation actually exists between the effected\nsubstance and the causal substance--is not possible.--That would, we reply,\ninvolve the vice of mutual dependence; for only when the separateness of cause\nand effect is established, the relation of the abode and that which abides can\nbe established; and only when the latter relation is established, the relation\nof separateness can be established. For the Vedantins acknowledge neither the\nseparateness of cause and effect, nor their standing to each other in the\nrelation of abode and thing abiding, since according to their doctrine the\neffect is only a certain state of the cause 2.--Moreover, as the atoms are\nlimited (not of infinite extension), they must in reality consist of as many\nparts as we acknowledge regions of space 3, whether those be six or eight or\nten, and consequently they cannot be permanent; conclusions contrary to the\nVai _s_ eshika doctrine of the indivisibility and permanency of the atoms.--If\nthe Vai _s_ eshika replies that those very parts which are owing to the\nexistence of the different regions of space are his (indestructible)\n\np. 400\n\natoms; we deny that because all things whatever, forming a series of\nsubstances of ever-increasing minuteness, are capable of dissolution, until\nthe highest cause (Brahman) is reached. Earth--which is, in comparison with a\nbinary compound, the grossest thing of all--undergoes decomposition; so do the\nsubstances following next which belong to the same class as earth; so does the\nbinary compound; and so does, finally, the atom which (although the minutest\nthing of all) still belongs to the same general class (i.e. matter) with\nearth, &c. The objection (which the Vai _s_ eshika might possibly raise here\nagain) that things can be decomposed only by the separation of their parts  1,\nwe have already disposed of above, where we pointed out that decomposition may\ntake place in a manner analogous to the melting of ghee. Just as the hardness\nof ghee, gold, and the like, is destroyed in consequence of those substances\nbeing rendered liquid by their contact with fire, no separation of the parts\ntaking place all the while; so the solid shape of the atoms also may be\ndecomposed by their passing back into the indifferenced condition of the\nhighest cause. In the same way the origination of effects also is brought\nabout not merely in the way of conjunction of parts; for we see that milk, for\ninstance, and water originate effects such as sour milk and ice without there\ntaking place any conjunction of parts.\n\nIt thus appears that the atomic doctrine is supported by very weak arguments\nonly, is opposed to those scriptural passages which declare the Lord to be the\ngeneral cause, and is not accepted by any of the authorities taking their\nstand on Scripture, such as Manu and others. Hence it is to be altogether\ndisregarded by highminded men who have a regard for their own spiritual\nwelfare.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[395:1](sbe34193.htm#fr_376) The Sa _n_ khyas looking on everything (except\nthe soul) as being the pradhana in various forms.--There is no need of\nassuming with Govindananda that by the Sa _n_ khya of the text we have to\nunderstand the Vedanta.\n\n[395:2](sbe34193.htm#fr_377) Yayor dvayor madhya ekam avina _s_ yad apara _s_\nritam evavatish _th_ ate tav ayutasiddhau yathavayavavayavinau.\n\n[396:1](sbe34193.htm#fr_378) The connexion of cause and effect is of course\nsamavaya.\n\n[397:1](sbe34193.htm#fr_379) If the effect can exist before having entered\ninto connexion with the cause, the subsequent connexion of the two is no\nlonger samavaya but sa _m_ yoga; and that contradicts a fundamental Vai _s_\neshika principle.\n\n[397:2](sbe34193.htm#fr_380) This clause replies to the objection that only\nthose connexions which have been produced by previous motion are to be\nconsidered conjunctions.\n\n[398:1](sbe34193.htm#fr_381) A clause meant to preclude the assumption that\nthe permanent existence of the things connected involves the permanent\nexistence of the connexion.\n\n[398:2](sbe34193.htm#fr_382) It having been shown above that atoms cannot\nenter into sa _m_ yoga with each other, it is shown now that sa _m_ yoga of\nthe soul with the atoms cannot be the cause of the motion of the latter, and\nthat sa _m_ yoga of soul and manas cannot be the cause of cognition.\n\n[399:1](sbe34193.htm#fr_383) Ekasambandhyakarsha _n_ e yatra\nsambandhyantarakarsha _n_ a _m_ tatra sa _ms_ lesha _h_ , sa tu savayavana _m_\n_g_ atukash _th_ adina _m_ d _ri_ sh _t_ o na tu niravayavai _h_ savayavanam,\nato dvya _n_ ukasya savayavasya niravayavena parama _n_ una sa nopapadyate.\nBrahmavidyabh.\n\n[399:2](sbe34193.htm#fr_384) In answer to the question how, in that case, the\npractically recognised relation of abode, &c. existing between the cause and\nthe effect is accounted for.\n\n[399:3](sbe34193.htm#fr_385) For they must in that case have a northern end,\nan eastern end, &c.\n\n[400:1](sbe34193.htm#fr_386) And that on that account the atoms which he\nconsiders as the ultimate simple constituents of matter cannot be decomposed.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 18](sbe34194.htm)\n\n"
