For at that time\nthe gods said, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, doubtless, they meant to say, 'Seek ye\na layer!' Whilst meditating, they saw even that layer, the wind: they put it\ninto that (fire-altar), and in like manner does he (the priest) now put it\ntherein.\n\n8:2:3:22\\. He lays down the Pra _n_ abh _ri_ ts,--wind, doubtless, is breath:\nit is wind (air) he thus bestows Upon him (Agni). On the range of the Reta _h_\nsi _k_ (they are placed); for the Reta _h_ si _k_ are these two (worlds): it\nis within these two (worlds) that he thus places the wind; whence there is\nwind within these two (worlds).\n\np. 34\n\n[paragraph continues] He places them on every side: he thus places wind on all\nsides, whence the wind is everywhere. [He places them so as] on every side to\nrun in the same direction 1: he thus makes the wind everywhere (to blow) in\nthe same direction, whence, having become united, it blows from all quarters\nin the same direction. He lays them down alongside of the regional (bricks) 2:\nhe thereby places the wind in the regions, whence there is wind in all the\nregions.\n\n8:2:3:33\\. And, again, as to why he lays down the Pra _n_ abh _ri_ ts;--it is\nthat he thereby bestows vital airs on these creatures. He places them so as\nnot to be separated from the Vai _s_ vadevis: he thereby bestows vital airs\nnot separated from the creatures. [He lays them down with, Va _g_. S. XIV, 8],\n'Preserve mine up-breathing! Preserve my down-breathing! Preserve my through-\nbreathing! Make mine eye shine far and wide! Make mine ear resound!' He\nthereby bestows on them properly constituted vital airs.\n\n8:2:3:44\\. He then lays down the Apasya (bricks). For the gods, at that time,\nspake, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, doubtless, they meant to say, 'Seek ye a\nlayer!' Whilst meditating, they saw even that layer, rain:\n\np. 35\n\nthey put it into that (fire-altar) and in like manner does he now put it\ntherein.\n\n8:2:3:55\\. He put on the Apasyas; for rain is water (ap); it is rain he\nthereby puts into it (the altar; or into him, Agni). On the range of the Reta\n_h_ si _k_ (he places them), for, the Reta _h_ si _k_ being these two\n(worlds), it is on these two (worlds) that he thereby bestows rain, whence it\nrains therein. He places them on every side: he thus puts rain everywhere,\nwhence it rains everywhere. [He places them] so as everywhere to run in the\nsame direction 1: he thereby bestows rain (falling) everywhere in the same\ndirection, whence the rain falls everywhere, and from all quarters, in the\nsame direction. He places them alongside of those referring to the wind 2: he\nthereby puts rain into the wind, whence rain follows to whatever quarter the\nwind goes.\n\n8:2:3:66\\. And, again, as to why he lays down Apasyas,--he thereby puts water\ninto the vital airs. He places them so as not to be separated from the Pra _n_\nabh _ri_ ts: he thus places the water so as not to be separate from the vital\nairs. Moreover, water is food: he thus introduces food not separated from (the\nchannels of) the vital airs. [He lays them down with, Va _g_. S. XIV, 8],\n'Make the waters swell! Quicken the plants! Bless thou the two-footed! Protect\nthe four-footed! Draw thou rain from the sky!' He thereby puts water that is\nmade fit, into those (vital airs).\n\np. 36\n\n8:2:3:77\\. He then lays down the _Kh_ andasya 1 (bricks) for the gods, at that\ntime, spake, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, doubtless, they meant to say, 'Seek ye a\nlayer!' Whilst meditating, they saw even that layer, cattle (or beasts): they\nput it therein, and, in like manner, does he now put it therein.\n\n8:2:3:88\\. He lays down the _Kh_ andasyas; for the metres ( _kh_ andas) are\ncattle: it is cattle he thus puts into it (or, bestows on him, Agni). On every\nside (he places them): he thereby places cattle (or beasts) everywhere, whence\nthere are cattle everywhere. He places them alongside of the Apasyas: he thus\nestablishes the cattle on (or, near) water, whence cattle thrive when it\nrains.\n\n8:2:3:99\\. And, again, as to why he lays down _Kh_ andasyas. When Pra _g_\napati was relaxed, the cattle, having become metres, went from him. Gayatri,\nhaving become a metre, overtook them by dint of her vigour; and as to how\nGayatri overtook them, it is that this is the quickest (shortest) metre. And\nso Pra _g_ apati, in the form of that (Gayatri), by dint of his vigour,\novertook those cattle.\n\n8:2:3:1010\\. [He lays down four in front, with, Va _g_. S. XIV, 9], 'The head\nis vigour,'--Pra _g_ apati, doubtless, is the head: it is he that became\nvigour;--'Pra _g_ apati the metre,'--Pra _g_ apati indeed became a metre.\n\n8:2:3:1111\\. 'The Kshatra is vigour,'--the Kshatra, doubtless, is Pra _g_\napati, it is he that became vigour;--'the pleasure-giving metre,'--what is\nundefined\n\np. 37\n\nthat is pleasure-giving; and Pra _g_ apati is undefined, and Pra _g_ apati\nindeed became a metre.\n\n8:2:3:1212\\. 'Support is vigour,'--the support, doubtless, is Pra _g_ apati:\nit is he that became vigour;--'the over-lord the metre,'--the over-lord,\ndoubtless, is Pra _g_ apati, and Pra _g_ apati indeed became a metre.\n\n8:2:3:1313\\. 'The All-worker is vigour,'--the All-worker, doubtless, is Pra\n_g_ apati: it is he that became vigour;--'the highest lord the metre,'--Pra\n_g_ apati, the highest lord, doubtless, is the waters, for they (the waters of\nheaven) are in the highest place: Pra _g_ apati, the highest lord, indeed\nbecame a metre.\n\n8:2:3:1414\\. These then are four kinds of vigour, and four metres; this\n(makes) eight,--the Gayatri consists of eight syllables: this, assuredly, is\nthat same Gayatri in the form of which Pra _g_ apati then, by his vigour,\novertook those cattle; whence they say of worn-out cattle that they are\novertaken by vigour (or, age), and hence (the word) 'vigour' recurs with all\n(these bricks). And those cattle which went away from him (Pra _g_ apati) are\nthese fifteen other (formulas): the cattle are a thunderbolt, and the\nthunderbolt is fifteenfold: whence he who possesses cattle, drives off the\nevildoer, for the thunderbolt drives off the evildoer for him. And in whatever\ndirection, therefore, the possessor of cattle goes, that he finds torn up by\nthe thunderbolt.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[34:1](sbe4309.htm#fr_88) That is, the bricks placed in opposite quarters, run\nin the same direction; see [p. 26](sbe4307.htm#page_26), note\n[3](sbe4307.htm#fn_81).\n\n[34:2](sbe4309.htm#fr_89) The Pra _n_ abh _ri_ ts are placed beside the Vai\n_s_ vadevis so as to be separated from them by the respective section of the\nanukas or 'spines' (dividing the square 'body' of the altar into four\nquarters). Each Vai _s_ vadevi would thus be enclosed between an \xc3\x82 _s_ vini\nand a Pra _n_ abh _ri_ t; but whilst the \xc3\x82 _s_ vini and Vai _s_ vadevi are\nplaced in the same section (or quarter) of the altar, the Pra _n_ abh _ri_ t\ncomes to lie in the adjoining section, moving in the sunwise direction from\nleft to right.\n\n[35:1](sbe4309.htm#fr_90) See [p. 26](sbe4307.htm#page_26), note\n[3](sbe4307.htm#fn_81).\n\n[35:2](sbe4309.htm#fr_91). The five Apasya bricks are placed immediately to\nthe right of the Pra _n_ abh _ri_ ts (looking towards the latter from the\ncentre of the altar), so as to fill up the four remaining spaces between the\nfour sets of bricks on the range of the Reta _h_ si _k_.\n\n[36:1](sbe4309.htm#fr_92) These are otherwise called Vayasya (conferring\nvigour, or vitality), each formula containing the word vayas, 'vitality,\nforce.' There are nineteen such bricks which are placed on the four ends of\nthe two 'spines,' viz. four on the front, or east end of the spine proper, and\nfive on the hind end of it as well as on each end of the 'cross-spine.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 2, 4.
