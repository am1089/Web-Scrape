Having drunk (Soma) 1 and said, 'We are\n\np. 317\n\ninvited together 1,' he (the Adhvaryu) rises. He takes a piece of the cake,\nand at the place where the A _kh_ avaka, being seated, is now (about to)\nrecite, he puts the piece of cake in his hand and says, 'O A _kh_ avaka, say\nwhat thou hast to say!' Now, the A _kh_ avaka was excluded (from the Soma) 2.\n\n4:3:1:22\\. Indra and Agni preserved him for the production of creatures,\nwhence the A _kh_ avaka priest belongs to Indra and Agni. But it is by means\nof that sacrificial food, the piece of cake which he now puts in his hand, and\nby means of that (saying) of the seers which he now recites, it is thereby\nthey (Indra and Agni) preserve him.\n\n4:3:1:33\\. When the A _kh_ avaka has (again) taken his seat\n\np. 318\n\n[paragraph continues] (behind his hearth), he (his Adhvaryu) proceeds with the\nlibations of the seasons ( _Ri_ tugraha). The reason why he proceeds with the\nlibations of the seasons when the A _kh_ avaka is seated, is that the A _kh_\navaka represents a sexual union, since the A _kh_ avaka belongs to Indra and\nAgni, and Indra and Agni are two, and a productive union means a pair: from\nthat same productive union he produces the seasons, the year.\n\n4:3:1:44\\. And again why he proceeds with the libations of the seasons, when\nthe A _kh_ avaka is seated. The seasons, the year, are everything; he thus\nproduces everything: this is why he proceeds with the libations of the seasons\nwhen the A _kh_ avaka is seated.\n\n4:3:1:55\\. Let him draw twelve of them,--twelve months there are. in the year:\ntherefore he should draw twelve (cups of Soma). But he may also draw thirteen,\nfor, they say, there is a thirteenth month 1. Let him nevertheless draw twelve\nonly, for such is completeness.\n\n4:3:1:66\\. He draws them from the Dro _n_ akala _s_ a (Soma trough), for the\nDro _n_ akala _s_ a is Pra _g_ apati, and from out of that Pra _g_ apati he\nproduces the seasons, the year.\n\n4:3:1:77\\. He draws them by means of double-mouthed cups 2;--for where is the\nend of those two (cups) that are double-mouthed? Hence this year revolves\nwithout end. When he has drawn this (libation), he does not deposit it: whence\nthis year is ceaseless.\n\n4:3:1:88\\. He recites no invitatory prayer; since one\n\np. 319\n\ninvites with an invitatory prayer, and the present season has already come,\neither by day or by night. Nor does he utter a second Vasha _t_ , lest he\nshould turn away the seasons. Simultaneously they (the Adhvaryu and\nPratiprasthat _ri_ ) draw the two first and the two last libations: thus they\nembrace everything here by means of the year, and everything here is embraced\nwithin the year.\n\n4:3:1:99\\. Out (of the Havirdhana shed) walks the one, in steps the other,\nwhence these months pass following one another. But were both to walk out\ntogether, or were both to enter together, these months would assuredly pass\nseparated one from the other: therefore while out walks the one, in steps the\nother.\n\n4:3:1:1010\\. Six times they perform 1 with, 'With the\n\np. 320\n\nseason'--thereby the gods created the day; and four times with, 'With the\nseasons'--thereby they created the night. And, assuredly, were only this much\n(used), there would be nothing but night: it would never pass away.\n\n4:3:1:1111\\. Over and above they perform twice with the formula 'With the\nseason;' thereby the gods subsequently gave the day (again), whence it is now\nday there, then it will be night, and to-morrow day.\n\n4:3:1:1212\\. By 'With the season' the gods forsooth created the men, and by\n'With the seasons' the beasts; and because they created the beasts in the\nmiddle of those (men), therefore these beasts (cattle), being shut in on both\nsides, have come into the power of men.\n\n4:3:1:1313\\. And having performed six times with, 'With the season,' they both\nturn round their vessels to the other side; and having performed four times\nwith, 'With the seasons,' they turn round their vessels to the other side:\nfrom the one side (or mouth) indeed the gods created the day, and from the\nother side the night; from the one side the gods created men, and from the\nother beasts.\n\n4:3:1:1414\\. Now he draws the cups (for the seasons)\n\np. 321\n\ntherefrom 1, with (Va _g_. S. VII, 30), 'Thou art taken with a support: thee\nfor Madhu!' the Adhvaryu takes (the first); with 'Thou art taken with a\nsupport: thee for Madhava!' the Pratiprasthat _ri_ (the second). These two are\nthe spring (months 2): because in spring plants sprout and trees are brought\nto ripeness, therefore these two are Madhu (sweet) and Madhava.\n\n4:3:1:1515\\. With 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for _S_ ukra!' the\nAdhvaryu draws (the third); with 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for _S_\nu _k_ i!' the Pratiprasthat _ri_ (the fourth). These two are the summer\n(months): because during them it burns fiercest, therefore these two are _S_\nukra (clear) and _S_ u _k_ i (bright).\n\n4:3:1:1616\\. With 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for Nabhas!' the\nAdhvaryu draws (the fifth); with 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for\nNabhasya!' the Pratiprasthat _ri_ (the sixth). These two are (the months) of\nthe rainy season: it rains from yonder sky, and hence these two are Nabhas\n(mist, cloud) and Nabhasya.\n\n4:3:1:1717\\. With 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for Ish (sap)!' the\nAdhvaryu draws (the seventh); with 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for \xc3\x9br\n_g_ (food)!' the Pratiprasthat _ri_ (the eighth). These two are the autumn\n(months): because in autumn food (ur _g_ ) and juice, (namely) plants, ripen,\ntherefore these two are Isha and \xc3\x9br _g_ a.\n\n4:3:1:1818\\. With 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for Sahas!' the\nAdhvaryu draws (the ninth); with 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for\n\np. 322\n\n[paragraph continues] Sahasya!' the Pratiprasthat _ri_ (the tenth). These two\nare the winter (months): because the winter by force (sahas) brings these\ncreatures into his power, therefore these two are Saha and Sahasya.\n\n4:3:1:1919\\. With 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for Tapas!' the\nAdhvaryu draws (the eleventh); with 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for\nTapasya!' the Pratiprasthat _ri_ (the twelfth). These two are (the months) of\nthe dewy season: because during them it freezes most severely, therefore these\ntwo are Tapas and Tapasya.\n\n4:3:1:2020\\. With 'Thou art taken with a support: thee to A _m_ hasaspati\n(lord of trouble)!' he (the Adhvaryu) draws the thirteenth libation, if he\ndraw a thirteenth. The Pratiprasthat _ri_ then pours his residue into the\nAdhvaryu's vessel, or the Adhvaryu pours his residue into the Pratiprasthat\n_ri_ 's vessel. He (the Adhvaryu) takes it (to the Sadas) for the purpose of\ndrinking it 1.\n\n4:3:1:2121\\. Thereupon the Pratiprasthat _ri_ draws the Aindragna graha with\nthe vessel not used for the drinking. The reason why he draws the Aindragna\nlibation with the vessel not used for drinking is that\n\np. 323\n\nno second Vasha _t_ is pronounced on the Ritugrahas, and for them he is about\nto take the Aindragna graha: thus they become consecrated for him by a second\nVasha _t_ through the Aindragna.\n\n4:3:1:2222\\. And again, why he draws the Aindragna graha. By drawing the\nlibations to the seasons he has generated this All, and having generated this\nAll, he now establishes it on the out-breathing and in-breathing: hence this\nAll is established on the out-breathing and in-breathing, for Indra and Agni\nare the out-breathing and in-breathing, and these two, heaven and earth, are\nthe out-breathing and in-breathing, and within these two this All is\nestablished.\n\n4:3:1:2323\\. And again, why he draws the Aindragna cup. By drawing the\nlibations to the seasons he has generated this All, and having generated this\nAll, he lays the out-breathing and in-breathing into this All: hence these\ntwo, the out-breathing anti in-breathing, are laid into (or beneficial, hita,\nin) this All.\n\n4:3:1:2424\\. He now draws it from that (dro _n_ akala _s_ a trough) with (Va\n_g_. S. VII, 3, 1; Rig-veda III, 12, 1), 'O Indra and Agni, through our songs\ncome ye hither to the Soma, to the agreeable fume: drink thereof, urged by our\nhymn!--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Indra and Agni!'--with 'This is\nthy womb: thee to Indra and Agni!' he deposits it (on the mound), for it is\nfor Indra and Agni that he draws it.\n\n4:3:1:2525\\. Thereupon he draws the Vai _s_ vadeva cup 1.\n\np. 324\n\n[paragraph continues] For by drawing the Ritugrahas he has generated this All;\nbut were there nothing but that, there would indeed be only as many, creatures\nas were created in the beginning: no (more) would be generated.\n\n4:3:1:2626\\. Now, in that he draws the Vai _s_ vadeva graha, thereby he sends\nforth this All, these creatures in due order: whence these creatures are\ngenerated again repeatedly. He draws it with the _S_ u _k_ ra cup, for the _S_\nu _k_ ra (bright) is yonder burning (sun), and\n\np. 325\n\nwhat rays of his there are, they are the All-gods: therefore he draws it with\nthe _S_ ukra cup.\n\n4:3:1:2727\\. He draws it from that (Soma in the Dro _n_ akala _s_ a) with (Va\n_g_. S. VII, 33; Rig-veda I, 3, 7), 'Ye protectors and supporters of men, O\nAll-gods, come hither, ye givers, to the giver's liquor!--Thou art taken with\na support: thee to the All-gods!' with 'This is thy womb: thee to the All-\ngods!' he deposits it 1, for it is for the All-gods that he draws it.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[316:1](sbe2650.htm#fr_766) The Puro _d_ a _s_ a offerings, described in the\npreceding paragraphs, are followed by libations from the dvidevatya cups, viz.\nthe Aindravayava, Maitravaru _n_ a, and A _s_ vina. Each time the Adhvaryu is\nabout to make a libation, the Pratiprasthat _ri_ draws Soma-juice into the\n\xc3\x82ditya cup (patra) and makes libations therefrom immediately after the\nAdhvaryu on the north side of the fire. And each time he pours the remains\nfrom the \xc3\x82ditya cup into the \xc3\x82ditya sthali with, 'Thee to the \xc3\x82dityas!'\nfinally covering the latter with the former (see [IV, 3, 5,\n6](sbe2654.htm#4:3:5:6)). Then follows the filling of the cups of the _K_\namasins (see [p. 287](sbe2645.htm#page_287), note [2](sbe2645.htm#fn_693)),\nand the libations from the _S_ ukra and Manthin grahas (already anticipated in\n[IV, 2, 1, 13 ](sbe2645.htm#4:2:1:13)-[31](sbe2645.htm#4:2:1:31)) and from the\ncups of the _K_ amasins. Thereupon the Adhvaryu goes to the Sadas and sits\ndown opposite the Hot _ri_ ; and in alternate draughts and with mutual\n'invitations' they empty the p. 317 dvidevatya cups. The remains are poured\ninto the Hot _ri_ 's cup, and portions of the puro _d_ a _s_ as having then\nbeen put into those cups, they are deposited in the left track of the southern\ncart. The Adhvaryu and Pratiprasthat _ri_ then drink the remains of the _S_\nukra and Manthin cups; the other priests also drinking from their cups,\nwithout, however, quite emptying them, after which the cup-bearers deposit\nthem in the Havirdhana, behind the axle of the southern cart. Henceforward,\ntill the Vai _s_ vadeva cup is drawn ([IV, 3, 1, 25](sbe2650.htm#4:3:1:25)),\nthose cups are called nara _s_ a _m_ sa. The Adhvaryu then takes a piece of\nthe sacrificial cake and rises, calling out, 'We are invited together;' after\nwhich follows the rehabilitation of the A _kh_ avaka, referred to above. Being\ncalled upon by the Adhvaryu, he recites the verse Rig-veda V, 25, 1 (beginning\nwith 'a _kh_ a,' whence perhaps his name), 'Hither will I sing Agni the god\nfor your protection,' &c., and then says, 'Ye Brahmans, invite us Brahmans\nalso!' whereupon the Adhvaryu says, 'This Brahman desires an invitation:\ninvite him, Hot _ri_!' Being then invited, he pronounces an anuvakya, and his\ncup-bearer fills his cup, which henceforth ranks last but one, thus preceding\nthat of the \xc3\x82gnidhra. He now drinks from his cup, and the latter is then\ndeposited along with the other _K_ amasas; whereupon the priests, who have\ntaken part in the offering of the puro _d_ a _s_ as, and the sacrificer eat\nthe I _d_ a in the \xc3\x82gnidhra fire-house.\n\n[317:1](sbe2650.htm#fr_767) Or rather, we have been mutually invited.\n\n[317:2](sbe2650.htm#fr_768) See [III, 6, 2, 12](sbe2624.htm#3:6:2:12).\n\n[318:1](sbe2650.htm#fr_769) See part i, p. 321, note 6.\n\n[318:2](sbe2650.htm#fr_770) The two _Ri_ tu vessels are made of karshmarya or\na _s_ vattha wood, of the shape of spoon-bowls, with spouts on both sides.\nKaty. IX, 2, 13.\n\n[319:1](sbe2650.htm#fr_771) The twelve _Ri_ tugrahas are drawn alternately by\nthe Adhvaryu and Pratiprasthat _ri_ \\--the first two and the last two\nsimultaneously, the others singly, so that the one enters the cart-shed while\nthe other leaves. Both in entering and leaving the Pratiprasthat _ri_ passes\nby the Adhvaryu on the north side, and for a moment encircles him by passing\nhis arms round him and holding his own vessel south of him. With the exception\nof the last two libations, the libations are offered up entire (holocausts).\nWhen either of them is about to offer one of the first six libations, he calls\non the Maitravaru _n_ a to 'Prompt (the Hot _ri_ , &c.) by the season!'--and\nat the four succeeding ones (after turning round the vessels so as to put the\nother mouth in front) to 'Prompt by the seasons!' For the last two libations\nthey again reverse the vessels to the previous position and call on him to\n'Prompt by the season!' The Maitravaru _n_ a's formula runs thus: 'Let the Hot\n_ri_ pronounce the offering prayer to Indra!--From the Hot _ri_ 's cup, from\nheaven to earth, may he drink Soma together with the season (or, seasons)! O\nHot _ri_ , pronounce the offering prayer!' Whereupon the Hot _ri_ (Pot _ri_ ,\n&c.) recites--'We who worship,--From the Hot _ri_ 's cup, from heaven to\nearth, may he drink Soma together with the season (or, seasons)! Vausha _t_!'\nThese formulas are slightly varied according to the deity to whom the libation\nis offered, and the priest who pronounces the offering prayer and Vausha _t_.\nThe p. 320 deities and offering priests of the twelve libations are: 1. Indra\n--the Hot _ri_ ; 2. the Maruts--the Pot _ri_ ; 3. Tvash _t_ _ri_ and the wives\nof the gods--the Nesh _t_ _ri_ ; 4. Agni--the \xc3\x82gnidhra; 5. Indra-Brahman--the\nBrahma _n_ a _kh_ a _m_ sin; 6. Mitra-Varu _n_ a--the Maitra-varu _n_ a; 7-10.\nDeva Dravi _n_ odas--the Hot _ri_ Pot _ri_ ; Nesh _t_ _ri_ , and A _kh_ avaka\nrespectively; 11. the A _s_ vins--the Hot _ri_ ; 12. Agni G _ri_ hapati--the\nHot _ri_. For this last libation, the Maitravaru _n_ a in the first place\ncalls on the sacrificer with, 'O lord of the house, pronounce the offering\nprayer!' and the sacrificer then again on the Hot _ri_ with, 'O Hot _ri_ ;\npronounce the offering prayer upon this!' whereupon the Hot _ri_ pronounces\nthe (sacrificer's) offering prayer. Katy. IX, 13; _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana Sr. VII, 8;\nHaug, Transl. Ait. Br. p. 135.\n\n[321:1](sbe2650.htm#fr_772) Viz. from the Dro _n_ akala _s_ a trough; see\nparagraph [6](sbe2650.htm#4:3:1:6).\n\n[321:2](sbe2650.htm#fr_773) The Ka _n_ va text adds _ri_ tu in each case.\n\n[322:1](sbe2650.htm#fr_774) The Ka _n_ va text has 'bhakshyam' instead of\n'bhaksham.' Each of the priests who have pronounced the offering prayer and\nVausha _t_ partakes of this Soma in his respective order,--the Hot _ri_ thus\ntaking four draughts; and the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasthat _ri_ (who, after\ndrawing the Aindragna cup, join them in the Sadas) drinking alternately from\nthe same vessel with those Hot _ri_ priests, who pronounced the Vasha _t_ at\ntheir libations. As at the drawing of the libations, the vessel is turned\nround after the sixth and tenth offering priests have drank. The vessel having\nbeen emptied, the Adhvaryu takes it outside the Sadas, and then sits down in\nfront of the Hot _ri_ 's hearth, with his face to the east, till the\nrecitation of the _S_ astra ([IV, 3, 2, 2](sbe2651.htm#4:3:2:2)).\n\n[323:1](sbe2650.htm#fr_775) According to Katy. IX, 13, 33 seq. the order of\nperformance is as follows. In the first place the first \xc3\x82 _g_ ya- _s_ astra is\nrecited. Thereupon the Adhvaryu fetches the Aindragna cup from the Havirdhana\n(where it was deposited by the Pratiprasthat _ri_ ), makes a libation from it\n--after calling on the Hot _ri_ , as at all libations accompanied p. 324 by a\n_s_ astra, 'Singer of praises, recite Soma's offering prayer;' the nara _s_ a\n_m_ sa cups being shaken by the cup-bearers at the same time--and then drinks\nthe remaining Soma with the Hot _ri_. Thereupon he draws the Vai _s_ vadeva\ncup from the Dro _n_ akala _s_ a, pours the remaining juice from the latter\ninto the Putabh _ri_ t, and spreads the straining-cloth over the empty vessels\nfor the midday pressing. He also prepares the Savaniya puroda _s_ as (see [p.\n315](sbe2649.htm#page_315), note [4](sbe2607.htm#fn_99)), for the midday\nfeast, omitting however the dish of clotted curds (payasya). Then follows the\nchanting of the first \xc3\x82 _g_ ya stotra by the Udgat _ri_ s, and the recitation\nof the Prauga- _s_ astra by the Hot _ri_ , after which takes place the Vai _s_\nvadeva libation (and emptying of the cup) in the same way as with the\nAindragna--the _k_ amasas being also drained of their contents by the\nrespective priests. Then follows the distribution--already referred to [IV, 2,\n3, 11](sbe2647.htm#4:2:3:11) seq.--of the Soma in the Ukthya bowl into three\nparts for the three Hotrakas, now about to recite their _s_ astras (preceded\nby their respective stotras). The Adhvaryu takes one portion of the Soma,\ncalls on the Udgat _ri_ s to chant the stotra, and afterwards on the Pra _s_\nast _ri_ (Maitravaru _n_ a) to recite his _s_ astra; after which he makes a\nlibation from the portion of Soma, and pours the remainder into the Pra _s_\nast _ri_ 's cup, to be drunk by that priest. In the same way the Pratiprasthat\n_ri_ then proceeds with the portions of the two other Hotrakas, viz. the\nBrahma _n_ a _kh_ a _m_ sin and A _kh_ avaka. Each time also the ten _k_\namasas are filled, and after libations therefrom, are emptied by the _K_\namasins. See also [p. 287](sbe2645.htm#page_287), note\n[2](sbe2645.htm#fn_693). At the end of the performance the priests pass\nsilently out (ni _h_ sarp, see [p. 299](sbe2648.htm#page_299), note\n[1](sbe2648.htm#fn_718)) of the Sadas by the back-door and out of the Vedi;\nthe midday performance afterwards beginning with the pratisarpa _n_ a, or\n'creeping back' to the Sadas, with homage to the dhish _n_ ya hearths, &c.\n\n[325:1](sbe2650.htm#fr_776) Viz. in the place of the _S_ ukra cup, on the\nsouth-east corner of the khara or mound.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 3, 2.
