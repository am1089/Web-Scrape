By the mere will; Scripture stating that.\n\nConcerning the released soul Scripture states, 'He moves about there,\nlaughing, playing, rejoicing, be it with women, or chariots, or relatives' (\n_Kh_. Up. VIII, 12, 3). The doubt here arises whether the soul's meeting with\nrelatives and the rest presupposes an effort on its part or follows on its\nmere will--as things spring from the mere will of the highest Person.--An\neffort is required; for we observe in ordinary life that even such persons as\nkings and the like who are capable of realising all their wishes do not\naccomplish the effects desired without some effort.--Against this view the\nSutra says 'by the mere will.' For, in a previous passage, Scripture expressly\nsays, 'He who desires the world of the Fathers, by his mere will the Fathers\nrise to receive him,' &c. (VIII, 2, 1). And there is no other text declaring\nthe need of effort which would oblige us to define and limit the meaning of\nthe text last quoted.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 9.
