[1](ry440.htm#fn_958)  \nThey fought with fists and hands, alike  \nPrepared to parry and to strike.  \nLong time the doubtful combat, waged  \nWith matchless strength and fury, raged.  \nEach fiercely struck, each guarded well,  \nTill, closing, from the tower they fell,  \nAnd, grasping each the other's throat,  \nLay for an instant in the moat,  \nThen rose, and each in fiercer mood  \nThe sanguinary strife renewed.  \nWell matched in size and strength and skill  \nThey fought the dubious battle still.  \nWhile sweat and blood their limbs bedewed  \nThey met, retreated, and pursued:  \nEach stratagem and art they tried,  \nStood front to front and swerved aside.  \nHis hand a while the giant stayed  \nAnd called his magic to his aid.  \nBut brave Sugriva, swift to know  \nThe guileful purpose of the foe,  \nGained with light leap the upper air.  \nAnd breath and strength and spirit then;  \nThen, joyous as for victory won,  \nReturned to Raghu's royal son.  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XLI.: Rama's Envoy.](ry440.htm)\n\n"
