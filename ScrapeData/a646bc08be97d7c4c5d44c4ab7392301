For love\nis the aim of every enquiry. He who comprehendeth my creed he is the\nexcellent.\n\n801\n\nWhen the husband; son--both (join) at once look at the wife\'s breasts with\nconstant gaze; the husband looks with desire for the flesh upon it, the son\nfor milk within it.\n\n802\n\nBeing himself the son of another daughter the base wretch drives away his\nmother. Such blackguards are not produced even by boars.\n\n803\n\nBy building chatrams (inns) at every step and by possession and wealth they\nincrease their splendour; [where ever](errata.htm#144) they wander their\nshadow [follows](errata.htm#145) them; i.e., God will reward them.\n\n804\n\np. 196\n\nYou take a binding rope, bind and secure it. What theft has Lingadu stolen\nthat he should be thus treated? Why is it that ye cannot be thus treated? Why\nis it that ye cannot see and worship the invisible atma linga?\n\n805\n\nTo eat the _caraca_ fruit (autaphrodisiac) and to bind his langoti tight, and\nto desert all women shew a vile nature. If thou bind it firmly (lit.\npleasurably) to a twig, will an elephant remain fixed.\n\n806\n\nMusing on a sweet lip, we forget all wisdom; how shall the man of devotion\nknow Thee. O God! Through a sight of the yoni shall we forget (Parama yogam)\nmeditation on the supreme.\n\n807\n\nThey cannot understand that there is but one God in the Siva, the Vishnu and\nall other creeds! Though these differ, can any diversity exist in truth\n(tatwa)?\n\n808\n\nIllusion (or death) is not an inconstant woman with glancing eyes, wearing\nbeads and earrings and mounting on her husband\'s shoulder, she delays not to\nslay those who yield to her.\n\np. 197\n\n809\n\nNourishing matted locks, to cry shame on the world, to distort all the limbs\nand all yogeeism (devoteeism)--This is to seize the woman of beatitude and\nkiss her.\n\n810\n\nWho is unable to instruct the minds of those brutes clothed in human bodies\nwho, while the mighty all exists within themselves seek him not within\nthemselves but roam the earth to find him.\n\n811\n\nAll those who pride on themselves on having bathed in the Ganges are defeated\nand consider their acts as mere vexation; surely the holy water of Vema\'s\nwisdom is nobler than the stream of Ganges and Gaya.\n\n812\n\nMounting the steed of thy mind not knowing how to govern it perplexing it, why\nshould the rider set out? Is Banares a dear friend of thine? Govern thy mind\nand thou shalt be independent of pilgrimage.\n\np. 198\n\n813\n\nYou put Siva, source of the Ganges, in the palm of your hand; and yet roam to\nthe holy streams. This is like possessing butter and yet searching for melted\nbutter.\n\n814\n\nWhy go to Mecca? Why return thence? Is not the only lord here with us? Allah\nMohammad universally exists in his fullness. (spreads undivided, animates\nunspurt)\n\n815\n\nThe fool binds a linga to his throat, and this also being insufficient he\nclimbs the mountain to visit the linga shine there at. Such a one can see\nbeatitude?\n\n816\n\nThey who knowing not the God who dwelleth in their body, wander and become\ntenants of the holy springs. These are like the ass that beareth about the\nsandal tree.\n\n817\n\nIf thou perform bathing but give no charity thou gainest but the\n[advantage](errata.htm#146) of the plunge, void of instruction. Is not a fowl\nwell versed in plunging in water?\n\np. 199\n\n[818](errata.htm#147)\n\nO! ye! hypocrites, who ignorant of the revolution of time, continually\n[perform](errata.htm#148) the daily rites and (meditation) _japa_ , what may\nbe the path by which perfection is attainable through these rites and\npostures.\n\n819\n\nSome of these fools wander this starry land to worship. They go to Ramanatha\n(Rameswaram) and then suffer scorn. They go to Concan on pilgrimage but in\ntruth merely to hear news that they had never heard.\n\n820\n\nBy going a pilgrimage to Banares, and bathing on the Ganges ye indeed suffer\nhardship but shall never attain heaven. No more than a buffalo calf can\nresemble a cow by merely following about it.\n\n821\n\nIf a fellow has gone to Banares what shall we say he has done? What if there\nhad been something to cause his death and he had died on the road, his mind\ntruly might still go to Kasi, but never can attain the better world.\n\n822\n\np. 200\n\nIf he who go to Kasi with great enthusiasm when by the wisdom of God they\nchange their bodies, in transmigration he gives half his merits to his wife,\nand has only half to himself.\n\n823\n\nThey who go to Kasi, get trouble and nothing else; why should ye roam merely\nto get an itching in your feet. Will not women also for hire get water and\nbear it about for hire?\n\n824\n\nA dog that has gone to Tirupati does not become a lion. A pig that goes to\nKasi is no elephant. A whore that goes to the Sri Shylam is no modest woman.\n\n825\n\nCeasing from food and sleep, a fool utterly void of understanding, for the\nsake of beatitude, roams the earth; he rambles like a mad dog.\n\n826\n\nHe who calls himself a yogee, and gets together some of the components of\nyogeeism, and kills those who are in the world--that yogi who roams and robs\nmen is no yogi but a (Ogu) vile wretch.\n\np. 201\n\n827\n\nHe who holds himself (a Paramahamsa) a perfect [ascetic](errata.htm#149), by\nrarely wearing a dress and longs for the wealth of others \'s no ascetic but\n(Parahimsa) death itself.\n\n828\n\nPostures and the like, bathings in the worship, pilgrimage to Kasi or a system\nof good works unless thou stay thy mind however many such paths thou walk,\nknow that they shall avail you nothing.\n\n[829](errata.htm#150)\n\nThey will [journey](errata.htm#151) on pilgrimages to Kasi and the bridge of\nRameswaram. They can hereby behold piles of stones but not heaven, not even\none of them.\n\n830\n\nIf thou give food to Bramins, they say it will be profitable to thee; if you\nwere to give it to dogs where would be the harm (inferiority)? They say that\none soul resides (both here and there) in [each](errata.htm#152).\n\np. 202\n\n831\n\nThe fool left his relations, bound himself with an iron langoti and\n[quitting](errata.htm#153) food and drink, and exceeded. If we give up the\nfluids of the body, can we attain perfection. How shall we have strength to\nworship?\n\n832\n\nPlunging, plunging and plunging in holy streams, squatting and\n[squatting](errata.htm#154) in meditation, talking and talking, charms\nbecoming leaner and leaner, roaming, roaming, roaming and roaming from\nsanctuary to sanctuary--ye turn giddy and are ruined.\n\n832\n\nThe impurities in the belly being the vilest of all, is the juice of food\nworse than that? Those therefore who fast, are fools unable to form\ncomparisons.\n\n834\n\nHe ignorant of the being that dwelleth in the body, wanders in other\npilgrimages is a fool. Does not a jackass thus roam bearing a pack saddle.\n\n835\n\np. 203\n\nThat world hater (or recluse) who is attached only to using the words of\nstubbornness, no-where shall he [attain](errata.htm#155) the power of quelling\ndeath (yama). The recluse of the iron age is vile as the drinker of palm wine.\n\n836\n\nWith their matted locks a fathom long, and their smearings of ashes, they\nforsooth are able to dispute the day with cupid himself and after all their\nvery garments become the property (petticoats) of whores.\n\n837\n\nBy a bald, head, and white streaks of ashes and postures, and airy diet, by\nall this a man is not a yogi unless his inner man be right.\n\n838\n\nIf we look at the fine dresses (sects) they are marvellously foolish. Devotion\ndoes not hereby dwell in the soul. They merely form la startling appearance.\nThey have neither the title nor the nature (viracti) of saints.\n\n839\n\nIf you see among harmless cattle, one handsome ox with horns, it is indeed\nsuperior. But is wisdom attained by the mere shaven baldness of the sanyasi?\n(who only resemble helpless [widows](errata.htm#156) in this fancy)\n\n840\n\np. 204\n\nThe long windedness (lit. breath) of a fowl, the steadfast gaze of a frog--\nsuch follies are written by fate in the forehead of the devotee. This must\nsurely befall him through his sins in a former birth.\n\n841\n\nIf he rub ashes to his body and wear long locks, though he be a king he shall\nfail of heaven; however stiff a screen be, is it yet a door?\n\n842\n\nWhile all the precepts declare Siva to be the divinity, they seek and worship\nother deities; surely Bramins are in the path of destruction.\n\n[843](errata.htm#157)\n\nHanging down their heads, void of the least patience opening and shutting his\neyes and dumb--this is no wisdom but merely the residue of thy sins.\n\n[844](errata.htm#158)\n\np. 205\n\nWoe to the world that is full of the destruction of souls. But first the woe\nto the Brahma! View all the Gods! Woe to them all.\n\n845\n\nThey call Brahma the author of the writing of fate in our foreheads. Perhaps\nBrahma, who dwelleth in the lotus (wrote) destined that his own head should\ncleave to the hand of (Bhava) Siva! (Siva smote Brahma on one head which was\nseparated and cleave to his hand.)\n\n846\n\nThose who believed in Siva have all become the share of the earth. Why then\nthese disputes and [discrimination](errata.htm#159) of Gods. All the faithful\nto Vishnu have fallen to the shares of white ashes.\n\n847\n\nIt is impracticable to dress oblations for however great a God, without\nimbibing the favour (or scent). Thus he has your leavings while ye talk of\n"devoting and setting aside as holy". Ye are still biting your lips at it.\n\n848\n\nThe fool deceived becomes a devotee to Siva and submitted to slavish tasks.\nBut the wise, an honoured, (badged) soldier is ever void of fear.\n\np. 206\n\n849\n\nThe skill of the laundress (who recognised the owner of each vest) is more\nthan that of the bookworm. Better is a dog than Ganesha the dumpy king; noble\nis truth than all the Gods in the world.\n\n850\n\nIf we know ourselves, the Veda would be all fooling to us; a mizzling rain is\nall folly to the store of grain; publish thou in the world O Vema that the six\n_sastras_ , and the Puranas are mere infelicity.\n\n851\n\nAll those of the race of Brahma are fallen creatures. Those of the race of\nRishies are ruined. Will they call near them these hateful wretches nor detest\nthem.\n\n852\n\nConsider the words of Vemana as those of a mad man. Some fall into channels\nand some into streams (proverb); but a small proportion of them are removed\nout of the (Veda Sastra) scriptural level.\n\n853\n\np. 207\n\nIn the thousand verses thus composed by Vemadu, many as are the bad, equally\nnumerous are the good. Secrecy gives a charm to beauty and obscurity to\nwisdom; should not a lovely girl lie exposed naked on the couch.\n\n854\n\nLike mad foxes do the Bramins read the Veda perpetually howling it out. They\nknow not its meanings. But Vemana knows the entire essence of the Vedas.\n\n855\n\nAll _yagnas_ were invented for the sake of discovering the fornications of a\nwife and the periodical ceremonies to the end of knowing a mother\'s adulteries\nIn so vile a way was the chapter of ceremonies invented.\n\n_Note_ : At commencing the sacrifice called _yagna_ the performer must require\nhis wife to confess whether she has been untrue to him. The periodical\nceremonies being performed to the late husband of a widow lead to the\nconviction, at least in her own mind, of her having been true or adulterous.\n\n856\n\nThe height of excellence is to abstain from slaying. Thus say the Bramins,\nlords of earth and still commit slaughter of animals in sacrifice. Better is\nthe _chandala_ who devours dead cattle.\n\n857\n\np. 208\n\nThey pinch and scrub their halters (nose ropes) and rub themselves to remove\nall dirt, and pour water into their privities. By thus cleansing the whole\nbody do they attain felicity.\n\n858\n\nPauper Bramins meet together and recite [babbling](errata.htm#160) charms and\ntalk saying they will perform the initiation of a boy into their caste. Like\nthe crow that has drunk the washing of rice and goes on crowing.\n\n859\n\nWhy take thy caste and pride thyself on it? Yea and what is the (twice born)\nBrahmin?\n\n860\n\nIf ignorant of service how can they become slaves? Ignorant of the Vaishnava\nbelief how can ye be Vaishnavite? While living, why do ye suffer burning like\ncorpses? (i.e., smear [yourselves](errata.htm#161) with ashes)\n\n861\n\nIf the pollutions caused by a birth or a death be real, and if the qualities\ncommunicated by that touch be destroyed to what end is it for a soul to become\na hermit.\n\np. 209\n\n862\n\nShall the wicked, being produced through carnal desire, talking vainly, with\nfalse words and deceiving men and twisting about to get money, shall such a\none become a teacher?\n\n863\n\nUnable to discern that this world is a delusion, some talk of the smock and\nsome of the langoti. These are mere tricks of the privities.\n\n864\n\nThe noble Brahmin goes to eat the vile funeral cakes of the ruined wretch. The\nBrahmin\'s wife haunts the marriage house; first they lose caste and then\ncharacter.\n\n865\n\nIn the night of ignorance doth the goddess of delusion wear her petticoat and\nconceal herself; in the daytime of wisdom, when about her work she looses her\n[petticoat](errata.htm#162); this is no prostitute but an edged sword in the\nhand.\n\n866\n\nThey are puffed up and cry I will perform a sacrifice, these who fill their\nbellies with the liquor vulva, these sons of whore brag nobly in their\nassemblies.\n\np. 210\n\n867\n\nHe calls men sudras and says begone thou sudra; this is a pariar worse than a\npariar. If he says I am a twice born does he thereby become one?\n\n868\n\nBorn and dying in ignorance of his prior state before all men, are they\nensnared by their lusts? To what end do they leave wisdom and roam the earth.\n\n869\n\nThese heroes--the Brahmins, Kshatrias and Vaisyas and Brahma, Vishnu and Siva\nall these are beasts. Ignorant of the divinity have they adopted forms thus\ndiversified,\n\n870\n\nDefilement appears no where in the least but exists in our ideas; whoever\nconsiders it will see that the beauty of the world is in truth extreme. If thy\nignorance depart, wisdom shall shine with thee.\n\n871\n\np. 211\n\nThose who abuse the practice of wearing ashes on the forehead, that is, the\nVaishnavites yet perform their funerals with fire and thus become the portion\nof the fire. They the Saivites who equally abuse the wearing of earth, by\nburying their dead become earth.\n\nThus the advantage of all their mutual abuse discovers itself in their shame,\n\n872\n\nHowever great the spell be, not even Brahma can utter it undefiled with\nspittle. But with what mouth is it they talk of spittle and defilement\n[thereby](errata.htm#163).\n\n873\n\nWhile the fire in our body is ignited and burns, to what end do (the\nVaishnavites) burn their corpses. By merely burning does he become mighty?\n\n874\n\nTo put cord over the neck as the Lingamites and then to suppose that their\nsoodra-ism has departed, this is mere (inferior sense) folly; if thy mind be\nnot settled, will a cord give thee caste?\n\n875\n\np. 212\n\nWearing a silk vest and putting the Vaishnavite streak on their forehead, the\nVaishnava sect has exalted its head in the earth. By the contrivance of\nnumberless fopperies has the Vishnava sect been ruined.\n\n876\n\nIf thou eat the body of a beast that eats pure grass they call you a pariar.\nYet if he eat fowls and pigs (which are the foulest of feeders) a man is\ncalled wise.\n\n877\n\nIf you go seasonably to the abode of Ranga (in the Cauveri) you will find the\ncharming smell of toddy. Truly this is scorn of the lord of the world. (The\nVaishnavites drink toddy while worshipping.)\n\n878\n\nIn the house of the body a wild fire blazes with hunger; why should you burn\nyour bodies? This is mere deception or perhaps this is punishment inflicted on\nthe Dasoos. (This is a sneer at Vaishnavites.)\n\n879\n\nThey find fault with the well used by the village and are delighted with the\nwater in which a holy man\'s feet have been washed. What profit is there in\nfoot washings?\n\np. 213\n\n880\n\nThose who understand omens and the interpretation of moles, are not to be met\nwith in the Iron age. For their own profit men will explain the virtue of\nthese. In cases where fortune meets us, these are accepted as its tokens.\n\n881\n\nA parcel of old whores (windows) join together in this age and through\ndevotion to Siva forsooth go on dancing. Shall such hypocrisy obtain them\nfelicity.\n\n882\n\nHe who cannot at first apply himself to restrain his passions, when he dies,\nseeks to become a devotee; void of purity of heart, how should beatitude\nappertain to him.\n\n883\n\nHe who has learnt to die, all his turning sanyasi is merely as though he at\nlast lost his caste; the sin of doing this alone is certain. There is no\nulterior profit in it.\n\n884\n\np. 214\n\nThe leaving (spittle) of a pretty white dog are pure in our eyes. The spittle\nof a young dancing girl is acceptable to us. These vile leavings are precious\neverywhere. Then why are the leavings of those we love evil in our sight.\n\n885\n\nHowever much you wash it well, (does) the defilement of the mouth depart? That\nalone is a mouth (which does not speak falsehood); that daily speak falsehood\nis not a mouth but a mouth below.\n\n886\n\nBinding the linga fairly on their body, but unable to fix his faith on that\nlingam, failing of beatitude, they perish in their folly.\n\n887\n\nAll those who trust in Vishnu fall to the share of white earth; to what end\nare these disputes and sects (dissensions) in religion. The Lingadharies\nbecome the portion of earth,\n\n888\n\nWhen he proceeds from his mother\'s womb, had he a lingam along with him? Then\nwhat a joke it is for him to wear one afterwards.\n\np. 215\n\n889\n\nThe Vaishnava sect puts on a silk turban and silk vest, and is puffed up in\nthe earth. These are mere semblances and the emptiness of the Vaishnava creed,\n\n890\n\nUnable to know the great secret, they continue and frame religions, and merely\ngive sorrow to each other, like as a dog that is agitated at the sight of a\nmirror,\n\n891\n\nYou see that those endowed with form all possess the first image. Why should\nye value this man or that as a superior. If ignorant of this principle, how\nshall he attain happiness?\n\n892\n\nA pariar eats flesh, all other people eat fat--are not they one caste? They do\nnot see that all castes are in fact one.\n\n893\n\nWhy dost again and again abuse a pariar? Are not his blood and flesh and thine\none? Of what caste is he who is immingled with him? The deity animates his\nentire works.\n\np. 216\n\n894\n\nWhen people see those who wear ashes they imagine that they contract inequity\nfrom them. When they see the Namadharies (Vaishnavities) they consider it\nhealing. What are the ashes, and what the white clay (of the Vaishnavites) in\nthe eyes of the supreme.\n\n895\n\nThose who are divided into sects are ten thousands. This is merely for filling\ntheir bellies--they cannot see the divine spirit. Can cranes however many they\nassemble, devour ships?\n\n896\n\nBy slaughtering the animals that eat grass men become pariars in the earth.\nBut what sort of caste is that, that eats pigs and fowls (as the respectable\nclasses do) that devour the dung of all?\n\n897\n\nIf men in the earth choose to take pipe clay and soften it well, then put it\nsmoothly on their foreheads it is merely a mark, and thereby men cannot become\nVaishnavites.\n\n898\n\np. 217\n\nThough thou put on the mark and call thyself a (servant) _adiya_ as the\nVaishnavites do and eat chewed pawn, bow down and call thyself a _Dasee_\n\\--This is all merely a means of subsistence but no ground for happiness.\n\n899\n\nWe see that men are like barber\'s basin, common to all; then, while they thus\nare mingled, why babble about their castes. Put thy right hand on their heads\nand expose this to their ridicule,\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 900-999](vov11.htm)\n\n'
