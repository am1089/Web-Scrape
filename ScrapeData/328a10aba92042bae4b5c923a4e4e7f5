On account of the term, (viz. the term 'lord' applied to it) the (person)\nmeasured (by a thumb) (is the highest Lord).\n\nWe read (Ka. Up. II, 4, 12), 'The person of the size of a thumb stands in the\nmiddle of the Self,' &c., and (II, 4, 13), 'That person, of the size of a\nthumb, is like a light without smoke, lord of the past and of the future, he\nis the same to-day and to-morrow. This is that.'--The question here arises\nwhether the person of the size of a thumb mentioned in the text is the\ncognitional (individual) Self or the highest Self.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that on account of the declaration of the person's\nsize the cognitional Self is meant. For to the highest Self which is of\ninfinite length and breadth Scripture would not ascribe the measure of a span;\nof the cognitional Self, on the other hand, which is connected with limiting\nadjuncts, extension of the size of a span may, by means of some fictitious\nassumption, be predicated. Sm _ri_ ti also confirms this, 'Then Yama drew\nforth, by force, from the body of Satyavat the person of the size of a thumb\ntied to Yama's noose and helpless' (Mahabh. III, 16763). For as Yama could not\npull out by force the highest Self, the passage is clearly seen to refer to\nthe transmigrating (individual soul) of the size of a thumb, and we thence\ninfer that the same Self is meant in the Vedic passage under discussion.\n\nTo this we reply that the person a thumb long can only\n\np. 196\n\nbe the highest Lord.--Why?--On account of the term 'lord of the past and of\nthe future.' For none but the highest Lord is the absolute ruler of the past\nand the future.--Moreover, the clause 'this is that' connects the passage with\nthat which had been enquired about, and therefore forms the topic of\ndiscussion. And what had been enquired about is Brahman, 'That which thou\nseest as neither this nor that, as neither effect nor cause, as neither past\nnor future, tell me that' (I, 2, l4).--'On account of the term,' i.e. on\naccount of the direct statement, in the text, of a designation, viz. the term\n'Lord,' we understand that the highest Lord is meant  1.--But still the\nquestion remains how a certain extension can be attributed to the omnipresent\nhighest Self.--The reply to this is given, in the next Sutra.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[196:1](sbe34093.htm#fr_195) This last sentence is directed against the\npossible objection that ' _s_ abda,' which the Sutra brings forward as an\nargument in favour of the highest Lord being meant, has the sense of\n'sentence' (vakya), and is therefore of less force than li _n_ ga, i.e.\nindicatory or inferential mark which is represented in our passage by the a\n_n_ gush _th_ amatrata of the purusha, and favours the _g_ iva interpretation.\n_S_ abda, the text remarks, here means _s_ ruti, i.e. direct enunciation, and\n_s_ ruti ranks, as a means of proof, higher than li _n_ ga.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 25](sbe34094.htm)\n\n"
