The cow, wishing for glory, the mother of the bounteous Maruts, sends\nforth her milk; the two horses [1](sbe3252.htm#an_8:94:1:1) have been\nharnessed to the chariots,--\n\n2\\. She in whose lap [1](sbe3252.htm#an_8:94:2:1) all gods observe their\nduties, sun and moon (also), that they may be seen;\n\n3\\. Therefore all our friends [1](sbe3252.htm#an_8:94:3:1), the singers,\ninvite the Maruts always, to drink (our) Soma.\n\n4\\. This Soma here has been prepared, the Maruts drink of it, the A _s_ vins\nalso drink of the lord (Soma) [1](sbe3252.htm#an_8:94:4:1).\n\n5\\. Mitra, Aryaman, Varu _n_ a drink of the Soma which is continually\n[1](sbe3252.htm#an_8:94:5:1) clarified, dwelling in three abodes\n[2](sbe3252.htm#an_8:94:5:2), procuring offspring.\n\n6\\. May Indra also rejoice to his satisfaction in this pressed juice, mixed\nwith milk, like a Hot _ri_ [1](sbe3252.htm#an_8:94:6:1) at the morning-\nsacrifice.\n\n7\\. Did the brilliant lords flare up? Endowed with pure strength they rush,\nlike water, through their enemies.\n\n8\\. Shall I now choose the favour of you, the great gods, who by yourselves\nshine forth marvellously,\n\n9\\. The Maruts, who, when going to drink Soma, spread out the whole earth and\nthe lights of heaven [1](sbe3252.htm#an_8:94:9:1).\n\n10\\. I call now them who are endowed with pure strength, you, O Maruts, from\nheaven, that you may drink the Soma here;\n\np. 409\n\n11\\. I call now those Maruts who hold heaven and earth asunder, that they may\ndrink the Soma here;\n\n12\\. I call now that manly company of the Maruts, dwelling in the mountains,\nthat they may drink the Soma here.\n\np. 410\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nAscribed to Bindu or Putadaksha. Metre, Gayatri. Verse 1 = SV. I, 149; verse 4\n= SV. I, 174; II, 1135; verse 5. = SV. II, 1136; verse 6 = SV. II, 1137. The\nwhole hymn can easily be divided into t _ri_ _k_ as.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. I adopt Ludwig's correction of the Pada, changing vahni _h_ to vahni\niti, though it interrupts somewhat the connection between the first and second\nverses. Still it seems as impossible to change P _ri_ _s_ ni, the mother of\nthe Maruts, into a cart-horse as into a sucking-calf. This we should have to\ndo, if we took dhayati in its usual sense of sucking. Still dhayati means to\nsuck, not to suckle. The commentary to the SV. explains vahni _h_ as vo _dh_\nri, the driver.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. I should prefer to take upasthe in the sense of proximity, which, as\nin the case of v _ri_ kshopasthe, may be translated by shadow, or protection.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. I cannot believe that we can take arya a\xc2\xb4 in our passage as arye a\xc2\xb4,\nand translate it with Pischel (Z. D. M. G. XL, p. 125) by 'our singers among\nthe Aryas.' With the plural karava _h_ we should expect aryeshu a\xc2\xb4, not arye\na\xc2\xb4; sec also Bergaigne, III, 287; II, 218. Pada a and b are galita, see VI,\n45, 33.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Svara _g_ seems to be meant for Soma as lord, not as brilliant.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Tana is generally explained by urnastukanirmita da _s_ apavitra; see\nalso Bergaigne, I, 179.\n\nNote 2. The three abodes are either the morning. noon,\n\np. 411\n\nand evening sacrifices, or the three Soma-vessels, the Dro _n_ akala _s_ a,\n\xc3\x82dhavaniya, and Putabh _ri_ t.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. I do not see why hota-iva should not mean 'like the priest,' for the\npriest also rejoices in the libation; see Arthasa _m_ graha, ed. Thibaut, pp.\n10 and 20. Ludwig prefers to take hota for Agni, fire.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. See note to I, 6, 9, and 10, note 1.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: X, 77. To the Maruts (the Storm-gods)](sbe3253.htm)\n\n"
