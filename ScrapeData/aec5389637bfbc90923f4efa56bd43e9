That made itself its Self, therefore it is\ncalled the Self-made 3.' That which is Self-made is a flavour 4 (can be\ntasted), for only after perceiving a flavour can any one perceive pleasure.\nWho could breathe, who could breathe forth, if that bliss (Brahman)\n\np. 59\n\nexisted not in the ether (in the heart)? For he alone causes blessedness.\n\nWhen he finds freedom from fear and rest in that which is invisible,\nincorporeal, undefined, unsupported, then he has obtained the fearless. For if\nhe makes but the smallest distinction in it, there is fear for him} 1. But\nthat fear exists only for one who thinks himself wise 2, (not for the true\nsage.)\n\nOn this there is also this _S_ loka:\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[58:1](sbe15039.htm#fr_219) In the _Kh_ andogya-upanishad VI, 2, 1, where a\nsimilar account of the creation is given, the subject is spoken of as tad,\nneuter. It is said there: 'In the beginning there was that only which is, one\nonly, without a second. It willed, may I be many,' &c. (Cf. B _ri_ h. \xc3\x82r. Up.\nVol. ii, p. 52.)\n\n[58:2](sbe15039.htm#fr_220) What appears as real and unreal to the senses, not\nthe really real and unreal.\n\n[58:3](sbe15040.htm#fr_221) Cf. Ait. Up. I, 2, 3.\n\n[58:4](sbe15040.htm#fr_222) As flavour is the cause of pleasure, so Brahman is\nthe cause of all things. The wise taste the flavour of existence, and know\nthat it proceeds from Brahman, the Self-made. See Kaushitaki-upanishad I, 5;\nSacred Books, vol. i, p. 277.\n\n[59:1](sbe15040.htm#fr_223) Fear arises only from what is not ourselves.\nTherefore, as soon as there is even the smallest distinction made between our\nSelf and the real Self, there is a possibility of fear. The explanation ud =\napi, aram = alpam is very doubtful, but recognised in the schools. It could\nhardly be a proverbial expression, 'if he makes another stomach' meaning as\nmuch as, 'if he admits another person.' According to the commentator, we\nshould translate, 'for one who knows (a difference), and does not know the\noneness.'\n\n[59:2](sbe15040.htm#fr_224) I read manvanasya, the commentator amanvanasya.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 8](sbe15041.htm)\n\n"
