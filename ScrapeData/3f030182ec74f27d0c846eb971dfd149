S\'ri Suta said :-- \xc2\x93I am highly fortunate; I consider myself blessed and\nI am purified by the Mahatmas (high souled persons); inasmuch as I am\nquestioned by them about the highly meritorious Pura _n_ a, famous in the\nVedas. I will now speak in detail about this Pura _n_ a, the best of the\n\xc3\x82gamas, approved of by all the Vedas and the secret of all the S\xc2\x92astras.\n\n\n\nO Brahmins! I bow down to the gentle lotus feet, known in the three Lokas, of\nthe Devi Bhagavati, praised by Brahma and the other devas Vi _sn_ u, Mahes\xc2\x92a\nand others, meditated always by the Munindras and which the Yogis contemplate\nas their source of liberation. Today I will devotedly describe, in detail and\nin plain language, that Pura _n_ a which is the best of all the Pura _n_ as,\nwhich gives prosperity and contains all the sentiments (Rasas) that a human\nbeing can conceive, the S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam.\n\n\n\nMay that Highest Primal S\xc2\x92akti who is known as Vidya in the Vedas; who is\nomniscient, who controls the innermost of all and who is skilled in cutting\noff the knot of the world, who cannot be realised by the wicked and the\nvicious, but who is visible to the Munis in their meditation, may that\nBhagavati Devi give me always the buddhi fit to describe the Pura _n_ a!\n\n\n\nI call to my mind the Mother of all the worlds who creates this universe,\nwhose nature is both real (taking gross, practical point of view) and and\nunreal (taking a real point of view), preserves and destroys by Her Rajasik,\nSattvik and Tamasik qualities and in the end resolves all these into Herself\nand plays alone in the period of Dissolution - at this lime, I remember my\nthat Mother of all the worlds.\n\n\n\n6-10. It is commonly known that Brahma is the creator of this universe; and\nthe knowers of the Vedas and the Pura _n_ as say so; but they also say that\nBrahma is born of the navel-lotus of Vi _sn_ u. Thus it appears that Brahma\ncannot create independently. Again Vi _sn_ u, from whose navel lotus Brahma is\nborn, lies in Yoga sleep on the bed of Ananta (the thousand headed serpent) in\nthe time of Pralaya; so how can we call Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u who rests on the\nthousand headed serpent Ananta as the creator of the universe? Again the\nrefuge of Ananta is the water of the\n\n\n\np. 4\n\n\n\nocean Ekar _n_ ava; a liquid cannot rest without a vessel; so I take refuge of\nthe Mother of all beings, who resides as the S\xc2\x92akti of all and thus is the\nsupporter of all; I fly for refuge unto that Devi who was praised by Brahma\nwhile resting on the navel lotus of Vi _sn_ u who was lying fast asleep in\nYoga _n_ idra. O Munis! meditating on that Maya Devi who creates, preserves\nand destroys the universe who is kuown as composed of the three gu _n_ as and\nwho grants mukti, I now describe the whole of the\n\nPura _n_ as; now you all better hear.\n\n\n\n11-16. The Pura _n_ a S\xc2\x92rimad Bhagavat (Devi Bhagavat) is excellent and holy;\neighteen thousand pure S\xc2\x92lokas are contained in it. Bhagavan Kri _sn_ a\nDvaipayan has divided this Pura _n_ a into twelve auspicious Skandhas (Books)\nand three hundred and eighteen chapters. Twenty chapters compose the first\nSkandha; twelve chapters in the second Skandha; thirty chapters in the the\nthird Skandha; twenty-five chapters in the fourth Skandha, thirty-five, in the\nfifth; thirty-one, in the sixth; forty, in the seventh; twenty-four, in the\neighth; fifty chapters in the ninth; thirteen, iu the tenth; twenty-four in\nthe eleventh and fourteen chapters are contained in the twelfth Skandha, O\nMunis! Thus the Dvaipayan Muni has arranged his chapters in each Skandha.\n\n\n\n17-20. Thus the Mahatma Veda Vyas has divided this Bhagavata Pura _n_ a. into\nso many Skandhas and into so many chapters; and that the number of verses is\neighteen thousand is already stated. That is denominated as Pura _n_ a which\ncontains the following five characteristics :-- (1) Creation of the universe,\n(2) Secondary creation, (3) Dynasties (4) Manvantaras and (5) The description\nof Manus and other kings.\n\n\n\nS\xc2\x92iva is beyond Prakritic attributes, eternal and ever omnipresent; She is\nwithout any change, immutable, unattainable but by yoga; She is the refuge of\nthe universe and Her nature is Turiya Chaitanya. Maha Lakshmi is Her Sattviki\nS\xc2\x92akti; Sarasvati is Her Rajasik S\xc2\x92akti and Maha Kali is Her Tamasik S\xc2\x92akti;\nthese are all of feminine forms.\n\n\n\n21-25. The assuming of bodies by these three S\xc2\x92aktis for the creation of this\nuniverse is denominated as "Sarga" (creation) by the high souled persona\n(Maharpuru _s_ a), skilled in S\xc2\x92astras. And the further resolution of these\nthree S\xc2\x92aktis into Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and Mahes\'a for the creation,\npreservation, and destruction of this universe is denominated (in this Pura\n_n_ a) as Pratisarga (secondary ereation.) The description of the kings of the\nsolar and lunar dynasties and the families of Hira _n_ ya Kasipu and others is\nknown as the description of the lineages of kings and their dynasties. The\ndescription of Svayambhuva and, other Manus\n\n\n\np. 5\n\nand their ruling periods is known as Manvantaras. And the description of their\ndescendants is known as the description of their families. (Thus these are the\nfive characteristics in the Pura _n_ as.) O best of Munis! all the Pura _n_ as\nare endowed with these five characteristics.\n\n\n\n26-32. So is Mahabharata writen by Vedavyasa, characterised by these five\nthings. This is known as the fifth Veda and Itihasa (history.) In this are\nsomething more than one lakh slokas. S\xc2\x92aunaka said :-- \xc2\x93O Suta! What are those\nPura _n_ as and how many verses are contained in each? Speak all those in\ndetail in this holy K _se_ ttra; we, the residents of Naimisaranya are all\nvery eager to hear this. (Why we call ourselves as the residents of\nNaimisaranya, hear; you will realise then that no other place exists in this\nKali age for hearing the holy discourses on religion) :-- When we were afraid\nof the Kali age, Brahma gave us a Manomaya Chakra (wheel) and I said to all of\nus :-- Follow this wheel, go after it and the spot where the felly of the\nwheel will become thin (so as to break) and will not roll further, that\ncountry is the holy place; Kali will never be able to enter there; you all\nbetter remain there until the Satya age comes back. Thus, acording to the\nsaying of Brahma, we have got orders to stay here. On hearing the words of\nBrahma, wo went out quickly keeping the wheel go on, our object being to\ndetermine which place is best and holiest. When we came here, the felly of the\nwheel become thin and shorn before my eyes; hence this K _s_ ettra is called\nNaimis; it is the most sanctifying place.\n\n\n\nKali cannot enter here; hence the Mahatmas, Munis and Siddhas, terrified by\nthe Kali age, have followed me and resorted to this place. We have performed\nyaj\xc3\xb1as with Purodasa (clarified butter as is offered in oblations to fire)\nwhere no animals are sacrificed; now we have no other important work to do\nexcept to pass our time here until the arrival of Satyayuga. O S\xc2\x92uta! we are\nextremely fortunate in all respects that you have come here; purify us to-day\nby narrating to us the names of the Pura _n_ as equivalent to the Vedas. O\nS\xc2\x92uta! you are also a learned orator; we, too, are ardent listeners, with no\nother works to bother our heads; narrate to us to-day the auspicious holy\nBhagavata Pura _n_ a. O S\xc2\x92uta! Long live you; and no ailings, internal,\nexternal, or from the Devas torment you. (this is our blessing to you). We\nhave heard that in the most sanctifying Pura _n_ a, narrated by Mahar _s_ i\nDvaipayan, all about Dharma (religion), Artha (Wealth) and Kama (desires) are\nduly described as well the acquiring of Tattvaj\xc3\xb1an and liberation are also\nspoken of. O S\xc2\x92uta! our desires are not satisfied the more we hear of those\nbeautiful holy words. Now describe to us the highly pure S\xc2\x92rimad Devi\n\n\n\np. 6\n\nBhagavatam where all the Lilas (the dramatic acts) of the Mother of the three\nworlds purifying the sins, adorned with all the qualifications are described\nas yielding all the desires like the Kalpa Vrik _s_ a (the celestial tree\nyielding all desires).\n\n\n\nThus ends the second chapter of the first Skandha on the description of the\nPura _n_ a (the text) in Maha Pura _n_ a S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000\nverses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyas.\n\n\n\nHer ends the Second Chapter of S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam on questions put by\nSaunaka and other Ri _s_ is.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 3](bk01ch03.htm)\n\n'
