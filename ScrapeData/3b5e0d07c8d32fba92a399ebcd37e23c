It is ascribed\nto the Atharva-veda, and occasionally to the Pippalada- _s_ akha, one of the\nmost important _s_ akhas of that Veda. Pippalada is mentioned in the Upanishad\nas the name of the principal teacher.\n\n_S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, in the beginning of his commentary, says:\n\np. xliii\n\n[paragraph continues] Mantroktasyarthasya vistaranuvadidam Brahma _n_ am\narabhyate, which would mean \'this Brahma _n_ a is commenced as more fully\nrepeating what has been declared in the Mantra.\' This, however, does not, I\nbelieve, refer to a Mantra or hymn in the Atharva-veda-samhita, but to the Mu\n_n_ _d_ aka-upanishad, which, as written in verse, is sometimes spoken of as a\nMantra, or Mantropanishad. This is also the opinion of \xc3\x82nandagiri, who says, I\none might think that it was mere repetition (punarukti), if the essence of the\nSelf, which has been explained by the Mantras, were to be taught here again by\nthe Brahma _n_ a.\' For he adds, \'by the Mantras "Brahma devanam," &c.,\' and\nthis is evidently meant for the beginning of the Mu _n_ _d_ aka-upanishad,\n\'Brahma devanam.\' \xc3\x82nandagiri refers again to the Mu _n_ _d_ aka in order to\nshow that the Pra _s_ _\xc3\xb1_ a is not a mere repetition, and if _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara calls\nthe beginning of it a Brahma _n_ a, this must be taken in the more general\nsense of \'what is not Mantra 1.\' Mantropanishad is a name used of several\nUpanishads which are written in verse, and some of which, like the \xc3\x8e _s_ a,\nhave kept their place in the Sa _m_ hitas.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xliii:1](sbe15008.htm#fr_51) Mantravyatiriktabhage tu brahma _n_ asabda _h_ ,\nRig-veda, Saya _n_ a\'s Introduction, vol. i, p. 23.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII: Maitrayana-Brahmana-Upanishad](sbe15009.htm)\n\n'
