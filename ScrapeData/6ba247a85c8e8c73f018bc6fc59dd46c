An _Uttara-Kanda_ or\nSupplement is added, describing the fate of Sita, and giving the poem a sad\nending.\n\nThe dark cloud of suspicion still hung on the fame of Sita, and the people of\nAyodhya made reflections on the conduct of their king, who had taken back into\nhis house a woman who had lived in the palace of Ravan. Rama gave way to the\nopinion of his people, and he sent away his loving and faithful Sita to live\nin forests once more.\n\nSita found an asylum in the hermitage of Valmiki, the reputed author of this\nEpic, and there gave birth to twins, Lava and Kusa. Years passed on, and Lava\nand Kusa grew up as hermit boys, and as pupils of Valmiki.\n\nAfter years had passed, Rama performed a great Horse-sacrifice. Kings and\nprinces were invited from neighbouring countries, and a great feast was held.\nValmiki came to the sacrifice, and his pupils, Lava and Kusa, chanted there\nthe great Epic, the Ramayana, describing the deeds of Rama. In this\ninteresting portion of the poem we find how songs and poetry were handed down\nin ancient India by memory. The boys had learnt the whole of the Epic by\nheart, and chanted portions of it, day after day, till the recital was\ncompleted. We are told that the poem consists of seven books, 500 cantos, and\n24,000 couplets. Twenty cantos were recited each day, so that the recital of\nthe whole poem must have taken twenty-five days. It was by such feats of\nmemory and by such recitals that literature was preserved in ancient times in\nIndia. Rama recognised his sons in the boy-minstrels, and his heart yearned\nonce more for Sita, whom he had banished but never forgotten. He asked the\nPoet Valmiki to restore his wife to him, and he desired that Sita might once\nmore prove her purity in the great assembly, so that he might take her back\nwith the approval of his people.\n\nSita came. But her life had been darkened by an unjust suspicion, her heart\nwas broken, and she invoked the Earth to take her back. And the Earth, which\nhad given Sita birth, yawned and took back her suffering child into her bosom.\n\nIn the ancient hymns of the _Rig Veda_ , Sita is simply the goddess of the\nfield-furrow which bears crops for men. We find how that simple conception is\nconcealed in the _Ramayana_ , where Sita the heroine of the Epic is still born\nof the field-furrow, and after all her adventures returns to the Earth. To the\nmillions of men and women in India, however, Sita is not an allegory; she\nlives in their hearts and affections as the model of womanly love, womanly\ndevotion. and a wife\'s noble self-abnegation.\n\nThe portions translated in this Book form the whole or portions of Sections\nxcii., xciii., xciv., and xcvii. of Book vii, of the original text.\n\n## I\n\n## THE SACRIFICE\n\nYears have passed; the lonely Rama in his joyless palace reigned,  \nAnd for righteous duty yearning, _Aswa-medha_ rite ordained,\n\nAnd a steed of darkest sable with the valiant Lakshman sent,  \nAnd with troops and faithful courtiers to Naimisha\'s forest went.\n\nFair was far Naimisha\'s forest by the limpid Gumti\'s shom.  \nMonarchs came and warlike chieftains, Brahmans versed in sacred lore,\n\nBharat with each friend and kinsman served them with the choicest food,  \nProud retainers by each chieftain and each crowned monarch stood.\n\nPalaces and stately mansions were for royal guests assigned,  \nPeaceful homes for learned Brahmans were with trees umbrageous lined,\n\nGifts were made unto the needy, cloth by skilful weavers wrought,  \nEre the suppliants spake their wishes, ere they shaped their inmost thought!\n\nRice unto the helpless widow, to the orphan wealth and gold,  \nGifts they gave to holy Brahmans, shelter to the weak and old,\n\nGarments to the grateful people crowding by their monarch\'s door,  \nFood and drink unto the hungry, home unto the orphan poor.\n\nAncient rishis had not witnessed feast like this in any land,  \nBright Immortals in their bounty blest not with a kinder hand,\n\nThrough the year and circling seasons lasted Rama\'s sacred feast,  \nAnd the untold wealth of Rama by his kindly gifts increased!\n\n## II\n\n## VALMIKI AND HIS PUPILS\n\nForemost midst the gathered Sages to the holy _yajna_ came  \nDeathless Bard of Lay Immortal--Saint Valmiki rich in fame,\n\nMidst the humble homes of _rishis_ , on the confines of the wood,  \nCottage of the Saint Valmiki in the shady garden stood.\n\nFruits and berries from the jungle, water from the crystal spring,  \nWith a careful hand Valmiki did unto his cottage bring,\n\nAnd he spake to gentle Lava, Kusa child of righteous fame,  \nSita\'s sons, as youthful hermits to the sacred feast they came:\n\nLift your voices, righteous pupils, and your richest music lend,  \nSing the Lay of _Ramayana_ from the first unto the end,\n\nSing it to the holy Brahman, to the warrior fair and tall,  \nIn the crowded street and pathway, in the monarch\'s palace hall,\n\nSing it by the door of Rama,--he ordains this mighty feast,  \nSing it to the royal ladies,--they shall to the story list,\n\nSing from day to day unwearied, in this sacrificial site,  \nChant to all the gathered nations Rama\'s deeds of matchless might,\n\nAnd this store of fruits and berries will allay your thirst and toil,  \nGentle children of the forest, unknown strangers in this soil!\n\nTwenty cantos of the Epic, morn to night, recite each day,  \nTill from end to end is chanted _Ramayana\'s_ deathless Lay,\n\nAsk no alms, receive no riches, nor of your misfortunes tell,  \nUseless unto us is bounty who in darksome forests dwell,\n\nChildren of the wood and mountain, cruel fortune clouds your birth,  \nStainless virtue be your shelter, virtue be your wealth on earth!\n\nIf the royal Rama questions and your lineage seeks to know,  \nSay,--Valmiki is our Teacher and our Sire on earth below,\n\nWake your harps to notes of rapture and your softest accents lend,  \nWith the music of the poet music of your voices blend,\n\nBow unto the mighty monarch, bow to Rama fair and tall,  \nHe is father of his subjects, he is lord of creatures all!"\n\n## III\n\n## RECITAL OF THE RAMAYANA\n\nWhen the silent night was ended, and their pure ablutions done,  \nJoyous went the minstrel brothers, and their lofty lay begun,\n\nRama to the hermit minstrels lent a monarch\'s willing car,  \nBlended with the simple music dulcet was the lay to hear,\n\nAnd so sweet the chanted accents, Rama\'s inmost soul was stirred,  \nWith his royal guests and courtiers still the deathless lay he heard!\n\nHeralds versed in old _Puranas_ , Brahmans skilled in pious rite,  \nMinstrels deep in lore of music, poets fired by heavenly might,\n\nWatchers of the constellations, min\'sters of the festive day,  \nMen of science and of logic, bards who sang the ancient lay,\n\nPainters skilled and merry dancers who the festive joy prolong  \nHushed and silent in their wonder listed to the wondrous song!\n\nAnd as poured the flood of music through the bright and livelong day,  \nEyes and ears and hearts insatiate drank the nectar of the lay,\n\nAnd the eager people whispered: "See the boys, how like our king  \nAs two drops of limpid water from the parent bubble spring!\n\nWere the boys no hermit-children, in the hermit\'s garments clad,  \nWe would deem them Rama\'s image,--Rama as a youthful lad!"\n\nTwenty cantos of the Epic thus the youthful minstrels sung,  \nAnd the voice of stringed music through the Epic rolled along,\n\nOut spake Rama in his wonder: "Scarce I know who these may be,  \nEighteen thousand golden pieces be the children-minstrels\' fee!"\n\n"Not so," answered thus the children, "we in darksome forests dwell,  \nGold and silver, bounteous monarch, forest life beseem not well!"\n\n"Noble children!" uttered Rama, "dear to me the words you say,  \nTell me who composed this Epic,--Father of this deathless Lay?"\n\n_\n\n"Saint Valmiki," spake the minstrels, "framed the great immortal song  \nFour and twenty thousand verses to this noble Lay belong,\n\nUntold tales of deathless virtue sanctify his sacred line,  \nAnd five hundred glorious cantos in this glorious Epic shine,\n\nIn six Books of mighty splendour was the poet\'s task begun,  \nWith a seventh Book, supplemental is the poet\'s labour done,\n\nAll thy matchless deeds, O monarch, in this Lay will brighter shine,  \nList to us from first to ending if thy royal heart incline!"\n\n_\n\n"Be it so," thus Rama answered, but the hours of day were o\'er,  \nAnd Valmiki\'s youthful pupils to their cottage came once more.\n\nRama with his guests and courtiers slowly left the royal hall,  \nEager was his heart to listen, eager were the monarchs all,\n\nAnd the voice of song and music thus was lifted day to day,  \nAnd from day to day they listened to Valmiki\'s deathless Lay!\n\n## IV\n\n## LAVA AND KUSARA RECOGNISED\n\nFlashed upon the contrite Rama glimpses of the dawning truth,  \nAnd with tears of love paternal Rama clasped each minstrel youth,\n\nYearned his sorrow-stricken bosom for his pure and peerless dame,  \nSita banished to the forest, stainless in her righteous fame!\n\nIn his tears repentant Rama to Valmiki message sent,  \nThat his heart with eager longing sought her from her banishment:\n\n"Pure in soul! before these monarchs may she yet her virtue prove,  \nGrace once more my throne and kingdom, share my unforgotten love,\n\nPure in soul! before my subjects may her truth and virtue shine,  \nQueen of Rama\'s heart and empire may she once again be mine!"\n\n## V\n\n## SITA LOST\n\nMorning dawned; and with Valmiki, Sita to the gathering came,  \nBanished wife and weeping mother, sorrow-stricken, suffering dame,\n\nPure in thought and deed, Valmiki gave his troth and plighted word,--  \nFaithful still the banished Sita, in her bosom held her lord!\n\nMighty Saint," so Rama answered as he bowed his humble head,  \n\'Listening world will hear thy mandate and the word that thou hast said,\n\nNever in his bosom Rama questioned Sita\'s faithful love,  \nAnd the God of Fire incarnate did her stainless virtue prove!\n\nPardon, if the voice of rumour drove me to a deed of shame,  \nBowing to my people\'s wishes I disowned my sinless dame,\n\nPardon, if to please my subjects I have bade my Sita, roam,  \nTore her from my throne and empire, tore her from my heart and home!\n\nIn the dark and dreary forest was my Sita left to mourn,  \nIn the lone and gloomy jungle were my royal children born,\n\nHelp me, Gods, to wipe this error and this deed of sinful pride,  \nMay my Sita prove her virtue, be again my loving bride!"\n\nGods and Spirits, bright Immortals to that royal Yajna came,  \nHen of every race and nation, kings and chiefs of righteous fame,\n\nSoftly through the halls of splendour cool and scented breezes blew,  \nFragrance of celestial blossoms o\'er the royal chambers flew.\n\nSita, saw the bright Celestials, monarchs gathered from afar,  \nSaw her royal lord and husband bright as heaven-ascending star,\n\nSaw her sons as hermit-minstrels beaming with a radiance high,  \nMilk of love suffused her bosom, tear of sorrow filled her eye!\n\nRama\'s queen and Janak\'s daughter, will she stoop her cause to plead,  \nWitness of her truth and virtue can a loving woman need?\n\nOh! her woman~s heart is bursting, and her day on earth is done,  \nAnd she pressed her heaving bosom, slow and sadly thus begun:\n\n_\n\n"If unstained in thought and action I have lived from day of birth,  \nSpare a daughter\'s shame and anguish and receive her, Mother Earth!\n\nIf in duty and devotion I have laboured undefiled,  \nAfter Earth I who bore this woman, once again, receive thy child!\n\nIf in truth unto my husband I have proved a faithful wife,  \nMother Earth I relieve thy Sita from the burden of this life!"\n\n_\n\nThen the earth was rent and parted, and a golden throne arose,  \nHeld aloft by jewelled Nagas as the leaves enfold the rose,\n\nAnd the Mother in embraces held her spotless sinless Child,  \nSaintly Janak\'s saintly daughter, pure and true and undefiled,\n\nGods and men proclaim her virtue! But fair Sita is no more,  \nLone is Rama\'s loveless bosom and his days of bliss are o\'er!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Conclusion](ramaconc.htm)\n\n'
