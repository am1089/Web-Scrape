He may set up the two fires 1 under the K _ri_ ttikas; for they,\nthe K _ri_ ttikas, are doubtless Agni\'s asterism, so that if he sets up his\nfires under Agni\'s asterism, (he will bring about) a correspondence (between\nhis fires and the asterism): for this reason he may set up his fires under the\nK _ri_ ttikas.\n\n2:1:2:22\\. Moreover, the other lunar asterisms (consist of) one, two, three or\nfour (stars), so that the K _ri_ ttikas are the most numerous (of asterisms)\n2: hence he thereby obtains an abundance. For this reason he may set up his\nfires under the K _ri_ ttikas.\n\n2:1:2:33\\. And again, they do not move away from the eastern quarter, whilst\nthe other asterisms do move from the eastern quarter. Thus his (two fires) are\nestablished in the eastern quarter: for this reason he may set up his fires\nunder the K _ri_ ttikas.\n\n2:1:2:44\\. On the other hand (it is argued) why he should not set up the fires\nunder the K _ri_ ttikas. Originally, namely, the latter were the wives of the\nBears ( _ri_ ksha); for the seven _Ri_ shis 3 were in former times\n\np. 283\n\ncalled the _Ri_ kshas (bears). They were, however, precluded from intercourse\n(with their husbands), for the latter, the seven _Ri_ shis, rise in the north,\nand they (the K _ri_ ttikas) in the east. Now it is a misfortune for one to be\nprecluded from intercourse (with his wife): he should therefore not set up his\nfires under the K _ri_ ttikas, lest he should thereby be precluded from\nintercourse.\n\n2:1:2:55\\. But he may nevertheless set up (his fire under the K _ri_ ttikas);\nfor Agni doubtless is their mate, and it is with Agni that they have\nintercourse: for this reason he may set up (the fire under the K _ri_ ttikas).\n\n2:1:2:66\\. He may also set up his fires under (the asterism of Rohi _n_ i. For\nunder Rohi _n_ i it was that Pra _g_ apati, when desirous of progeny (or\ncreatures), set up his fires. He created beings, and the creatures produced by\nhim remained invariable and constant 1, like (red) cows (rohi _n_ i): hence\nthe cow-like nature of Rohi _n_ i. Rich in cattle and offspring therefore he\nbecomes whosoever, knowing this, sets up his fires under Rohi _n_ i.\n\n2:1:2:77\\. Under Rohi _n_ i, indeed, the cattle set up their fires, thinking\nthat they might attain to (ruh) the desire (or love) of men. They did attain\nto the\n\np. 284\n\ndesire of men; and whatever desire the cattle then obtained in regard to men,\nthat same desire he obtains, in regard to cattle, whosoever, knowing this,\nsets up his fire under Rohi _n_ i.\n\n2:1:2:88\\. He may also set up his fires under (the asterism of) M _ri_ ga _s_\nirsha. For M _ri_ ga _s_ irsha, indeed, is the head of Pra _g_ apati 1; and\nthe head ( _s_ iras) means excellence ( _s_ ri), for the head does indeed mean\nexcellence: hence they say of him who is the most excellent ( _s_ resh _th_ a)\nof a community, that he is the head of that community. Excellence therefore he\nattains whosoever, knowing this, sets up his fire under M _ri_ ga _s_ irsha.\n\n2:1:2:99\\. On the other hand (it is argued) why one should not set up his fire\nunder M _ri_ ga _s_ irsha 2. The latter, indeed, is Pra _g_ apati\'s body. Now,\nwhen they (the gods) on that occasion pierced him 3 with what is called \'the\nthree-knotted arrow,\' he abandoned that\n\np. 285\n\nbody, for the body is a mere relic (or dwelling, vastu), unholy and sapless.\nHe should therefore not set up his fires under M _ri_ ga _s_ irsha.\n\n2:1:2:1010\\. But he may, nevertheless, set them up (under M _ri_ ga _s_\nirsha). For, assuredly, the body of that god, Pra _g_ apati, is neither a\nrelic nor unholy, 1: he may therefore set up (his fires under M _ri_ ga _s_\nirsha). \'Under the Punarvasu he should perform the Punaradheya 2,\' thus (it is\nprescribed).\n\n2:1:2:1111\\. He may also set up his fires under the Phalgunis. They, the\nPhalgunis, are Indra\'s asterism 3, and even correspond to him in name; for\nindeed Indra is also called Ar _g_ una, this being his mystic name; and they\n(the Phalgunis) are also called Ar _g_ unis. Hence he overtly calls them\nPhalgunis, for who dares to use his (the god\'s) mystic name? Moreover, the\nsacrificer himself is Indra, so that he in that case sets up his fires under\nhis own asterism. Indra is the deity of the sacrifice; and accordingly his\nAgnyadheya is thereby brought\n\np. 286\n\ninto relation with Indra. He may set up the fires under the first (Purva-\nphalgunis)--whereby an advancing (successful) sacrifice accrues to him; or he\nmay set them up under the second (Uttara-phalgunis)--whereby a progressive\n(uttaravat) improvement accrues to him.\n\n2:1:2:1212\\. Let him set up his fires under the asterism Hasta 1, whosoever\nshould wish that (presents) should be offered him: then indeed (that will take\nplace) forthwith; for whatever is offered with the hand (hasta), that indeed\nis given to him.\n\n2:1:2:1313\\. He may also set up his fires under _K_ itra. Now the gods and the\nAsuras, both of them sprung from Pra _g_ apati, were contending for\nsuperiority. Both parties were desirous of rising to yonder world, the sky.\nThe Asuras then constructed the fire (altar) called rauhi _n_ a (fit to ascend\nby), thinking, \'Thereby we shall ascend (a-ruh) to the sky 2.\'\n\np. 287\n\n2:1:2:1414\\. Indra then considered 1, \'If they construct that (fire-altar),\nthey will certainly prevail over us.\' He secured a brick and proceeded\nthither, passing himself off for a Brahman.\n\n2:1:2:1515\\. \'Hark ye!\' he said, \'I, too, will put on this (brick) for\nmyself!\' \'Very well,\' they replied. He put it on. That fire (altar) of theirs\nwanted but very little to be completely built up,--\n\n2:1:2:1616\\. When he said, \'I shall take back this (brick) which belongs to\nme.\' He took hold of it and pulled it out; and on its being pulled out, the\nfire-altar fell down; and along with the falling fire-altar the Asuras fell\ndown. He then converted those bricks into thunderbolts and clove the (Asuras\')\nnecks.\n\n2:1:2:1717\\. Thereupon the gods assembled and said, \'Wonderfully ( _k_ itram)\nindeed it has fared with us who have slain so many enemies!\' Hence the\nwonderful nature ( _k_ itratva) 2 of the asterism\n\np. 288\n\n[paragraph continues] _K_ itra; and verily wonderfully it fares with him, and\nhe slays his rivals, his spiteful enemy, whosoever, knowing this, sets up his\nfires under _K_ itra. A Kshatriya, therefore, should especially desire to take\nadvantage of this asterism; since such a one is anxious to strike, to vanquish\nhis enemies.\n\n2:1:2:1818\\. Originally these (nakshatras) were so many different powers\n(kshatra), just as that sun yonder. But as soon as he rose, he took from them\n(a-da) their energy, their power; therefore he (the sun) is called \xc3\x82ditya,\nbecause he took from them their energy, their power 1.\n\n2:1:2:1919\\. The gods then said, \'They who have been powers, shall no longer\n(na) be powers (kshatra) 2!\' Hence the powerlessness (na-kshatratvam) of the\nnakshatras. For this reason also one need only take the sun for one\'s\nnakshatra (star), since he took away from them their energy, their power. But\nif he (the sacrificer) should nevertheless be desirous of having a nakshatra\n(under which to set up his fires), then assuredly that sun is a faultless\nnakshatra for him; and through that auspicious day (marked by the rising and\nsetting of the sun) he should endeavour to obtain the benefits of whichever of\nthose asterisms he might desire. Let him therefore take the sun alone for his\nnakshatra 3.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[282:1](sbe1241.htm#fr_652) That is, the Garhapatya and \xc3\x82havaniya, the two\nprincipal fires.\n\n[282:2](sbe1241.htm#fr_653) Whilst the K _ri_ ttikas, or Pleiades, are\nsupposed to consist of seven (or, according to others, of six) stars. the\nremaining twenty-six nakshatras or lunar mansions, according to our author,\nvary between one and four stars. Hence the K _ri_ ttikas are also called\nBahulas, \'the numerous.\' In the later accounts, however, a larger number of\nstars is attributed to several nakshatras. Cf. Weber, Nakshatra, II, pp. 368,\n381. The Ka _n_ va text has: \'Other nakshatras are (i.e. consist of) four; and\nthere is here an abundance, so that he thereby obtains abundance.\'\n\n[282:3](sbe1241.htm#fr_654) Saptarshi, or the seven _Ri_ shis, is the\ndesignation of the p. 283 constellation of Ursa Major, or the Wain. In the\nRig-vela,. riksha _h_ (bears) occurs once (I, 24, 10), either in the same\nrestricted sense, or in that of stars generally.\n\n[283:1](sbe1241.htm#fr_655) \'Ta asya pra _g_ a _h_ s _ri_ sh _t_ a ekarupa\nupastabdhas tasthu rohi _n_ ya iva.\' The Ka _n_ va text reads: Tam ima _h_ pra\n_g_ a _h_ s _ri_ sh _t_ a rohi _n_ ya ivopastabdhas tasthur ekarapa iva. Saya\n_n_ a interprets upastabdha _h_ (\'propped up, erect,\' established) by\n\'pratibaddha _g_ ataya _h_ (of continuous lineage),\' and ekarupa _h_\n(\'uniform\') by \'avi _k_ _kh_ innapravaha _h_ (of uninterrupted flow or\nsuccession).\' In Taitt. Br. I, 1, 2, 2, it is stated that Pra _g_ apati\ncreated Agni under (the asterism) Rohi _n_ i, and that the gods then set up\nthat fire under the same asterism.\n\n[284:1](sbe1241.htm#fr_656) For the mythical allusions in this and the\nsucceeding paragraphs, we have to compare _S_ at. Br. I, 7, 4, 1; Ait. Br.\nIII, 33. According to the version of the myth given in the latter work, Pra\n_g_ apati transformed himself into a roe-buck ( _ri_ _s_ ya) and approached\nhis own daughter (either the sky, or the dawn), who had assumed the shape of a\ndoe (rohit). Out of their most fearful forms the gods then fashioned a divine\nbeing called Bhutavat (i.e. Rudra), in order to punish Pra _g_ apati for his\nincestuous deed. The latter was accordingly pierced by Bhutavat\'s arrow and\nbounded up to the sky, where he became the constellation called M _ri_ ga\n(i.e. M _ri_ ga _s_ irsha), while his daughter became the asterism Rohi _n_ i.\nThe arrow on the other hand, with which Pra _g_ apati was pierced, became the\nconstellation called \'the three-knotted arrow (perhaps the girdle of Orion).\'\n\n[284:2](sbe1241.htm#fr_657) The Black Ya _g_ us does not recommend this\nasterism for the performance of agnyadheya.\n\n[284:3](sbe1241.htm#fr_658) The Ka _n_ va text reads, \'When, on that occasion,\nthat god (viz. Rudra) pierced him with the three-knotted arrow.\'\n\n[285:1](sbe1241.htm#fr_659) Na va etasya devasya vastu naya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iya _m_ na\n_s_ ariram asti.--Na vai tasya vastu na nivirya _m_ naya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iyam asti,\n\'for the relic of that (god) is neither sapless nor impure.\' Ka _n_ va\nrecension.\n\n[285:2](sbe1241.htm#fr_660) I.e. the repetition of the adheya, or setting up\nof his fires, a ceremony which has to be performed in the event of the adheya\nhaving proved unsuccessful; that is, in case he should not have prospered or\neven sustained losses. The direction has been inserted in this place on\naccount of the position of Punarvasu, as the fifth mansion, between M _ri_ ga\n_s_ irsha, the third, and (Purva and Uttara) Phalgunis, the ninth and tenth\nmansions, in the original order of the nakshatras.\n\n[285:3](sbe1241.htm#fr_661) In Taitt. Br. I, 1, 2, 4, the Purve Phalguni are\nassigned to Aryaman, and the Uttare Phalguni to Bhaga. While, however, both\nthese asterisms are there recommended for the agnyadheya, the Purve Phalguni\nare rejected as unsuitable further on, in par. 8 (? a later addition).\n\n[286:1](sbe1241.htm#fr_662) In the Taitt. Br. this asterism is not mentioned\nas suitable for the agnyadheya. The \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_. II, 1, to omits both Hasta\nand _K_ itra; but permits the asterisms Vi _s_ akhe and Uttare Prosh _th_\napade.\n\n[286:2](sbe1241.htm#fr_663) In Taitt. Br. I, 1, 2, 4-6 this myth is related as\nfollows: \'There were Asuras, named Kalaka _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ as. They constructed a fire\n(altar) with a view to (gaining) the world of heaven. They put, every man of\nthem, a brick to it. Indra, passing himself off for a Brahman, put a brick on\nfor himself, saying, "This one, _K_ itra (the wonderful or bright one) by\nname, is for me!" They climbed up to heaven; Indra, however, pulled out his\nbrick, and they tumbled down. And they who tumbled down, became spiders: two\nof them flew up, and they became the two heavenly dogs.\' On this myth, Dr. A.\nKuhn, \'\xc3\x9cber entwickelungsstufen der mythenbildung,\' p. 129, remarks: \'The myth\ngiven in Homer\'s Od. xi, 305-325, of Otos and Ephialtes, who, in order to\nfight the immortal gods, piled Ossa on Olympos, and Pelion on Ossa, of \xe1\xbc\xb5\xce\xbd\xe1\xbe\xbd\n\xce\xbf\xe1\xbd\x90\xcf\x81\xce\xb1\xce\xbd\xe1\xbd\xb8\xcf\x82, and who are destroyed by Apollon, shows an obvious resemblance to\nthese Indian myths; the more so, if we divest the latter of their Brahmanical\nform, by which altar-bricks are substituted p. 287 for mountains; and if we\nhear in mind that the later versions of the myth, e.g. in the well-known\npassage of Ovid, put the Gigantes in the place of the Aloades.\' See also\nWeber, Nakshatra, II, p. 372.\n\n[287:1](sbe1241.htm#fr_664) The Ka _n_ va text here proceeds thus: The gods\nthen were afraid and said, \'If those (Asuras) complete (samasyanti) that\n(fire-altar), they will prevail over us.\' Then Indra having fastened a brick\nwith the lightning-band (arke _n_ a damna) went thither passing himself off\nfor a Brahman. He said, \'I, too, will put on this (brick) for myself.\' They\nsaid, \'On then (upa hi)!\' He put it on. That (fire-altar) wanted but very\nlittle to be built up, when he said, \'I shall take this (brick) which is\nmine,\' Take it then (a hi)!\' they said. Then seizing it (tam abhihaya) he\npulled it out. On its being pulled out the fire-altar tumbled down. On the\nfire-altar having tumbled down he made thunderbolts with those bricks and\nsmote those (Asuras). Then the gods prevailed and the Asuras were worsted, &c.\n\n[287:2](sbe1241.htm#fr_665) Or, perhaps, its identity with (Indra\'s brick) _K_\nitra; cf. preceding note.\n\n[288:1](sbe1241.htm#fr_666) The Ka _n_ va text reads: Tani ha va etani kshatra\n_n_ i nanaiva tepur yathasau va surya _s_ _k_ andrama va; tesha _m_ hodyann\nevaditya _h_ kshatra _m_ virya _m_ tega _h_ pralulopa, tad vaisham adade.\n\n[288:2](sbe1241.htm#fr_667) This etymology of nakshatra is of course quite\nfanciful. For Aufrecht\'s probably correct derivation of the word from nakta-\ntra, \'night-protector,\' cf. Zeitschrift fur vergl. Sprachf., VIII, pp. 71, 72.\nSee also Weber, Nakshatra; II, p. 268.\n\n[288:3](sbe1241.htm#fr_668) The Ka _n_ va text reads: Tasman na nakshatram\nadriyeta yadaivaisha kada _k_ odiyad apy adadhitaisha hi sarva _n_ i kshatra\n_n_ i p. 289 yadyu nakshatrakama _h_ syad upo asita nakshatram ahasya bhavati\nno etasyanudayo \'sti tasmad v apy upaina(m a)sita, \'he need therefore not\nattend to any nakshatra; but may set up his fires at any time when that (sun)\nrises, for he (the sun) is all the kshatras. Should he nevertheless be\ndesirous of a nakshatra, let him approach (the sun) with veneration; for then\nthere is a nakshatra for him, and that (sun) does not fail to rise: for this\nreason let him approach (the sun) with veneration.\'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1, 3.
