And although another inference be made, (the objections remain in force)\non account of the (pradhana) being devoid of the power of intelligence.\n\nBut--the Sa _n_ khya resumes--we draw another inference, so as to leave no\nroom for the objection just stated. We do not acknowledge the gu _n_ as to be\ncharacterised by absolute irrelativity and unchangeableness, since there is no\nproof for such an assumption. We rather infer the characteristics of the gu\n_n_ as from those of their effects, presuming that their nature must be such\nas to render the production of the effects possible. Now the gu _n_ as are\nadmitted to be of an unsteady nature; hence the gu _n_ as themselves are able\nto enter into the relation of mutual inequality, even while they are in a\nstate of equipoise.\n\nEven in that case, we reply, the objections stated above which were founded on\nthe impossibility of an orderly arrangement of the world, &c., remain in force\non account of the pradhana being devoid of the power of intelligence. And if\n(to escape those objections) the Sa _n_ khya should infer (from the orderly\narrangement of the world, &c.), that the primal cause is intelligent, he would\ncease to be an antagonist, since the doctrine that there is one intelligent\ncause of this multiform world would be nothing else but the Vedantic doctrine\nof Brahman.--Moreover, if the gu _n_ as were capable of entering into the\nrelation of mutual inequality even while in the state of equipoise, one of two\n\np. 376\n\nthings would happen; they would either not be in the condition of inequality\non account of the absence of an operative cause; or else, if they were in that\ncondition, they would always remain in it; the absence of an operative cause\nbeing a non-changing circumstance. And thus the doctrine would again be open\nto the objection stated before 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[376:1](sbe34185.htm#fr_337) Anantaro dosho mahadadikaryotpadayoga _h_. \xc3\x82n.\nGi.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 10](sbe34186.htm)\n\n'
