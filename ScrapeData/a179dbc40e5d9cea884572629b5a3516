Naraya _n_ a said :-- Only the twice born are to take this Tripu _nd_ ra\non the forehead and the other parts of the body after carefully purifying the\nashes by the mantra Agniriti Bhasma, etc. The Brahma _n_ s, K _s_ attriyas,\nand Vais\xc2\x92yas are known as the twiceborn, (the Dvijas). So the Dvijas ought to\ntake daily this Tripu _nd_ ra with great care. O Brahma _n_ a! Those who are\npurified with the ceremony of the holy thread, are called the Dvijas. For\nthese the taking of Tripu _nd_ ra as per S\xc2\x92ruti is very necessary. Without\ntaking this Vibhuti, any good work done is as it were not done. There is no\ndoubt in this. Even the japam of Gayatri is not well performed if this Bhasma\nbe not used. O Best of Munis! The Gayatri is the most important and the chief\nthing of the Brahma _n_ hood. But that is not advised if the Tripu _nd_ ra be\nnot taken. O Munis! As long as the ashes\n\n\n\np. 1092\n\n\n\nborn of Agni are not applied on the forehead, one is not entitled to be\ninitiated in the Gayatri Mantra. O Brahma _n_! Unless ashes be applied on the\nforehead, no one will recognise you as a Brahma _n_ a. For this reason I take\nthis holding of the merit-giving Tripu _nd_ ra as the cause of the Brahma _n_\nhood. I speak this verily unto you, that he is recognised as a Brahma _n_ a\nand literary on whose forehead there is seen the white ashes purified by the\nmantra. He is entitled to the state of a Brahma _n_ a who is naturally very\neager to collect the ashes as he collects the invaluable gems and jewels.\n\n\n\n11-20. Those who are not naturally eager to collect the Bhasma as they are\nnaturally eager to collect gems and jewel, are to be known as Cha _nd_ alas in\nsome of their previous births. Those who are not naturally joyous in holding\nTripu _nd_ ra, were verily Cha _nd_ alas in their previous births; this I tell\nyou truly very truly.\n\n\n\nThose who eat roots and fruits without holding ashes go to the terrible hells.\nHe who worships S\xc2\x92iva without having Bibhuti on his forehead, that wretch is a\nS\xc2\x92iva hater and goes to hell after his death. He who does not hold Bibhuti is\nnot entitled to any religious act.\n\n\n\nWithout taking Bibhuti, if you make a gift of Tula Puru _s_ a made of gold,\nyou won\xc2\x92t get any fruits. Rather you will have to go to hell!\n\n\n\nAs the Brahma _n_ as are not to perform their Sandhyas without their holy\nthreads, so without this Bibhuti, one ought not also to perform one\xc2\x92s Sandhya.\n\n\n\nIf at times a man by chance has no holy thread, he can do his Sandhya by\nmuttering the Gayatri or by fasting. But there is no such rule in holding\nBhasma.\n\n\n\nIf one performs Sandhya, without having any Bibhuti, he is liable to incur a\nsin; as without holding this Bhasma, no right can come to him to perform his\nSandhya.\n\n\n\nAs a man of a lowest caste acts contrary and incurs a sin if he hears the Veda\nmantra, so a twice-born incurs a sin if he performs Sandhya without having his\nTripu _nd_ ra. The twiceborn must therefore collect his thoughts with his\nheart intent on this Tripu _nd_ ra whether it be according to S\xc2\x92rauta or\nSmarta method; or in absence thereof the Laukika Bhasma. Of whatsoever sort is\nthe Bhasma, it is always pure. In the Sandhya and other actions of worship,\nthe twiceborn ought to be very careful and punctilious in using this Bhasma.\n\n\n\np. 1093\n\n\n\n21-31. No sin can enter into the body of one besmeared with ashes. For this\nreason, the Brahma _n_ as ought always to use ashes with great care. One is to\nhold the Tripu _nd_ ra, six Angulas high or greater by the fore, middle and\nring fingers of the right hand. If anybody uses Tripu _nd_ ra, shining and\nbrilliant, and extending from eye to eye, he becomes, no doubt, a Rudra. The\nring-finger is the letter \xc2\x93A,\xc2\x94 the middle finger is \xc2\x93U\xc2\x94 and the forefinger is\n\xc2\x93M\xc2\x94; so the Tripu _nd_ ra marks drawn by the above three fingers is of the\nnature of the three gu _n_ as. The Tripu _nd_ ra should be drawn by the\nmiddle, fore, and ring fingers in a reverse way (from the left of the forehead\nto its right). I will now tell you an anecdote, very ancient. Listen. Once\nDurvasa, the head of the ascetics, with his body besmeared with ashes and with\nRudraksam, all over, on his body went to the region of the Pitris, uttering\nloudly, \xc2\x93O S\xc2\x92ankara, of the Form of All! O S\xc2\x92iva! O Mother Jagadambe, the\nSource of all auspiciousness!\xc2\x94 The Pitris Kavya-Valas, etc., (Kavya Valanala\n_h_ Soma _h_ Yama _h_ schaivaryama Tatha, Agnisvattva, Varhisada _h_ , Somapa\n_h_ Pitri Devatah) got up, received him heartily and gave him seats and shewed\nhim great honours and respect and held many pure conversations with the Muni.\nDuring their talk, the sinners of the Kumbhipaka hell were crying, \xc2\x93Oh! Alas!\nWe are killed, we are being killed. Oh! We are being burnt!\xc2\x94 some others\ncried, \xc2\x93Oh! Oh! We are cut down.\xc2\x94 Thus various cries and lamentations reached\ntheir ears.\n\n\n\n32-40. Hearing their piteous cries, Durvasa, the prince of the Ri _s_ is,\nasked with a grievous heart the Pitris, \xc2\x93Who are those crying?\xc2\x94 The Pitris\nreplied :-- There is a city close to our place called \xc2\x93Samyamani Puri\xc2\x94 of the\nKing Yama where the sinners are punished. Yama gives punishment to the sinners\nthere. O Sinless One! In that city the King Yama lives with his terrible\nblack-coloured messengers, the personifications of Kala (the Destruction). For\nthe punishment of the sinners, eighty-six hells exist there. The place is\nbeing guarded always by the horrible messengers of Yama. Out of those hells,\nthe hell named Kumbhipaka is very big and that is the chief of the hells. The\nailings and torments of the sinners in the Kumbhipaka hell cannot be described\nin hundred years. O Muni! The S\xc2\x92iva-haters, the Vi _sn_ u-haters, the Devi-\nhaters are made to fall to this Ku _nd_ a. Those who find fault with the\nVedas, and blame the Sun, Ga _n_ es\xc2\x92a and tyrannise the Brahma _n_ as fall\ndown to this hell. Those who blame their mothers, fathers, Gurus, elder\nbrothers, the Smritis and Pura _n_ as and those as well who take the Tapta\nMudras (hot marks on their bodies) and\n\n\n\np. 1094\n\n\n\nTapta S\xc2\x92ulas (i.e., those who being S\xc2\x92aivas act as they like) those who blame\nthe religion (Dharma) go down to that hell.\n\n\n\n41-50. We hear constantly their loud piteous cries, very painful to hear;\nhearing which naturally gives rise to feelings of indifference (Vairagyam).\nHearing the above words of the Pitris, Durvasa, the prince of the Munis, went\nto the hell to see the sinners. O Muni! Going there, the Muni bent his head\ndownwards and saw the sinners when, instantly the sinners began to enjoy\npleasures more than those who enjoy in the Heavens. The sinners became\nexceedingly glad. Some began to sing, some began to dance, some began to\nlaugh; some sinners began to play one with one another in great ecstasy. The\nmusical instruments Mrida _n_ ga, Muraja, lute, Dhakka, Dundubhis, etc.,\nresounded with sweet sonorous tones (in accordance with five resonants). The\nsweet fragrant smell of the flowers of Vasanti creepers spread all round.\nDurvasa Muni became surprised to see all this. The messengers of Yama were\nstartled and immediately went to their King Yama and said :-- \xc2\x93O Lord! Our\nKing! A wondrous event occurred lately. The sinners in the Kumbhipaka hell are\nnow enjoying pleasures more than those in the Heavens. O Bibhu! How can this\ntake place! We cannot make out the cause of this. O Deva! We all have become\nterrified and have come to you.\xc2\x94 Hearing the words of the messengers,\nDharmaraja, mounting on his great buffalo, came there instantly and seeing the\nstate of the sinners sent news immediately to the Heavens.\n\n\n\n51-60. Hearing the news Indra came there with all the Devas, Brahma came there\nfrom His Brahmaloka; and Naraya _n_ a came there from Vaiku _nt_ ha. Hearing\nthis, the regents of the quarters, the Dikpalas came there with all their\nattendants from their respective abodes. They all came there to the Kumbhipaka\nhell and saw that all the beings there are enjoying greater pleasures than\nthose in the Heavens. They all were astonished to see this; and they could not\nmake out why this had happened. \xc2\x93What a wonder is this! This Ku _nd_ a has\nbeen built for the punishment of the sinners. When such a pleasure is now\nbeing felt here, the people won\xc2\x92t fear anything henceforth to commit sins. Why\nis this order of the Vedas created by God reversed? Why has God undone His own\ndoing? What a wonder is this! Now a great miracle is before our sight.\xc2\x94 Thus\nspeaking, they remained at a fix. They could not make out the cause of this.\nIn the meanwhile Bhagavan Naraya _n_ a after consulting with the other Devas\nwent with some Devas to the abode of\n\n\n\np. 1095\n\n\n\nS\xc2\x92ankara in Kailas\xc2\x92a. They saw there that S\xc2\x92ri Bhagavan S\xc2\x92ankara (with\ncrescent of the Moon on His forehead) was playing there attended always by the\nPramathas and adorned with various ornaments like a youth, sixteen years old.\nHis parts of the body were very beautiful as if the mine of loveliness. He was\nconversing on various delightful subjects with His consort Parvati and\npleasing Her mind. The four Vedas were there personified. Seeing Him, Naraya\n_n_ a bowed down and informed him clearly of all the wonderful events. He said\n:--\n\n\n\n61-75. \xc2\x93O Deva! What is the cause of all this? We cannot make out anything! O\nLord! Thou art omniscient. Thou knowest everything. So kindly mention how is\nthis brought about!\xc2\x94 Hearing Vi _sn_ u\xc2\x92s words. Bhagavan S\xc2\x92ankara spoke\ngraciously in sweet words, grave as the rumbling of a rain-cloud :-- \xc2\x93O Vi\n_sn_ u! Hear the cause of this. What wonder is there? This is all due to the\ngreatness of Bhasma (ashes)! What cannot be brought about by Bhasma! The great\nS\xc2\x92aiva Durvasa went to see the Kumbhipaka hell, besmearing his whole body with\nBhasma and looked downwards while he was looking at the sinners. At that time,\naccidentally a particle of Bhasma from his forehead was blown by air to the\nbodies of the sinners in the hell. Thereby they were freed of their sins and\nthey got so much pleasure! Such is the greatness of Bhasma! Henceforth the\nKumbhipaka will no more be a hell. It will be a Tirtha (holy place of\npilgrimage) of the residents of the Pitrilokas. Whoever will bathe there will\nbe very happy. There is no doubt in this. Its name will be henceforth the\nPitri Tirtha.\n\n\n\nO Sattama! My Lingam and the form of Bhagavati ought to be placed there. The\ninhabitants of the Pitri Loka would worship them. This will be the best of all\nthe Tirthas extant in the three Lokas. And if the Pitris\xc2\x92vari there be\nworshipped, know that the worship of the Triloki is done. Naraya _n_ a said\n:-- Hearing thus the words of S\xc2\x92ankara, the Deva of the Devas, He thanked Him\nand, taking His permission came to the Devas and informed them of everything\nwhat S\xc2\x92ankara had said. Hearing this, the Devas nodded their heads and said,\n\xc2\x93Sadhu (well, very well)\xc2\x94 and began to glorify the greatness of Bhasma. O\nTormenter of the enemies! Hari, Brahma and the other Devas began to eulogise\nthe glories of ashes. The Pitris became very glad to get a new Tirtha. The\nDevas planted a S\xc2\x92iva Lingam and the form of the Devi on the banks of the new\nTirtha, and began to worship them regularly day by day. The sinners that were\nthere suffering, all ascended on the celestial chariot and got up to Kailas\xc2\x92a.\nEven today they are\n\n\n\np. 1096\n\n\n\nall dwelling in Kailas\xc2\x92a and are known by the name of the Bhadras. The hell\nKumbhipaka came to be built afterwards in another place.\n\n\n\n76-84. Since that day the Devas did not allow any other devotee of S\xc2\x92iva to go\nto the newly created hell Kumbhipaka. Thus I have described to you the\nexcellent greatness of the Bhasma. O Muni! What more can there be than the\nglories of the Bhasma! O Best of Munis! Now I am telling you of the usage of\n\xc3\x9brdhapu _nd_ ra (the vertical marks) according to the proper province of the\ndevotees. Listen. I will now speak what I have ascertained from the study of\nthe Vai _sn_ ava S\xc2\x92astras, the measure of \xc3\x9brdhapu _nd_ ra, according to the\nAnguli measurements, the colour, mantra, Devata and the fruits thereof. Hear.\nThe earth required is to be seen red from the crests of hills, the banks of\nthe rivers, the place of S\xc2\x92iva (S\xc2\x92iva K _s_ ettram), the ocean beaches, the\nant-hill, or from the roots of the Tulasi plants. The earth is not to be had\nfrom any other places. The black coloured earth brings in peace, the red-\ncolour earth brings in powers to bring another to one\xc2\x92s control; the yellow-\ncoloured earth increases prosperity and the white-coloured earth gives Dharma\n(religion). If the \xc3\x9brdhapu _nd_ ra be drawn by the thumb, nourishment is\nobtained; if it be drawn by the middle finger, longevity is increased; if it\nbe drawn by nameless or ring finger, food is obtained and if it be drawn by\nthe fore finger, liberation is attained. So the \xc3\x9brdhapu _nd_ ras ought to be\ndrawn by these fingers, only be careful to see that the nails do not touch at\nthe time of making the mark. The shape of the \xc3\x9brdhapu _nd_ ra (the vertical\nmark or sign on the fore-head) is like a flame or like the opening bud of a\nlotus, or like the leaf of a bamboo, or like a fish, or like a tortoise or\nlike a conch-shell.\n\n\n\n85-95. The \xc3\x9brdhapu _nd_ ra, ten Angulis high is the super best; nine Angulis\nhigh, is best; eight Angulis high, is good; the middling \xc3\x9brdhapu _nd_ ra is of\nthree kinds as it is of seven Angulas, six Angulas, or five Angulas. The\nlowest \xc3\x9brdhapu _nd_ ra is again of three kinds as it is four Angulas, three\nAngulas or two Angulas high. On the \xc3\x9brdhapu _nd_ ra of the forehead, you must\nmeditate Kes\xc2\x92ava, on the belly you must think of Naraya _n_ a; on the heart,\nyou must meditate on Madhava; and on the neck, you must meditate on Govinda.\nSo on the right side of the belly, you must meditate on Madhusudana; on the\nroots of the ears, on Trivikrama; on the left belly, on Vamana; on the arms,\non S\xc2\x92ridhara; on the ears, Hri _s_ ikes\xc2\x92a; on the back, Padmanabha; on the\nshoulders Damodara; and on the head Brahmarandhra you must meditate on\nVasudeva. Thus the twelve\n\n\n\np. 1097\n\n\n\nnames are to be meditated. In the morning or in the evening time when you are\ngoing to make the Puja or Homa, you are to take duly, single-in-intent, the\nabove names and make the marks of \xc3\x9brdhapu _nd_ ras. Any man, with \xc3\x9brdhapu _nd_\nra on his head, is always pure, whether he be impure, or of unrighteous\nconduct or whether he commits a sin mentally. Wherever he dies, he comes to My\nAbode even if he be of a Cha _nd_ ala caste. My devotees ( Vira Vai _sn_ avas\nor Mahavira Vai _sn_ avas) who know My Nature must keep an empty space between\nthe two lines of \xc3\x9brdhapu _nd_ ra of the form of the Vi _sn_ upada (the feet of\nVi _sn_ u) and those who are my best devotees are to use nice \xc3\x9brdhapu _nd_\nras, made of turmeric powder, of the size of a spear (S\xc2\x92ula), of the form of\nthe feet of Vi _sn_ u (Vi _sn_ u padah).\n\n\n\n96\\. The ordinary Vai _sn_ avas are to use with Bhakti, the \xc3\x9brdhapu _nd_ ras\nwithout any empty space, but the form of it is to be like a flame, the blossom\nof a lily or like a bamboo leaf.\n\n\n\n97-110. Those who are Vai _sn_ avas in name only can use \xc3\x9brdhapu _nd_ ra of\nboth the kinds, with or without any empty space. They incur no sin if they use\none without an empty space. But those who are My good devotees, incur sin if\nthey do not keep an empty space between the two vertical lines (in the \xc3\x9brdhapu\n_nd_ ra three vertical lines are used). The Vai _sn_ avas who use excellent\nvertical rod like \xc3\x9brdhapu _nd_ ras keeping an empty space in the middle and\nuttering the mantra \xc2\x93Kesvaya Nama _h_ \xc2\x94 build My Temple there. In the\nbeautiful middle space of \xc3\x9brdhapu _nd_ ra, the Undecaying Vi _sn_ u is playing\nwith Lak _s_ mi. That wretch, the twice-born who uses \xc3\x9brdhapu _nd_ ra without\nany empty apace kills Vi _sn_ u and Lak _s_ mi, seated there. The stupid who\nuses \xc3\x9brdhapu _nd_ ra without a vacant space goes successively to twenty-one\nhells. The \xc3\x9brdhapu _nd_ ra should be of the size of a clear straight rod,\nlotus, flame, a fish with sharp straight edges and with vacant spaces between\nthem. O Great Muni! The Brahma _n_ a should always use the Tripu _nd_ ra like\nthe lock of hair on the crown of his head and like his Sacrificial thread;\notherwise all his actions will be fruitless. Therefore in all ceremonies and\nactions the Brahma _n_ as ought to use \xc3\x9brdhapu _nd_ ras of the form of a\ntrident, a circle or of a square form. The Brahma _n_ a who knows the Vedas is\nnever to use the semi-moonlike mark (Tilak) on his bead. The man who is of the\nBrahmi _n_ caste and follows the path of the Vedas should not even by mistake\nuse any other mark than those above-mentioned. Other sorts of pu _nd_ ras\n(marks) that are mentioned in other Vai _sn_ ava S\xc2\x92astras for the attainment\nof fame, beauty, etc., the Veda-knowing Brahma _n_ as should not use them. The\nVaidik Brahma _n_ as should not use even in error any other Tilaks than the\ncurved Tripu _nd_ ras\n\n\n\n1098}\n\n\n\nIf, out of delusion, the man, following the path of the Vedas, uses other\nsorts of Tripu _nd_ ras, he would certainly go down to hell.\n\n\n\n111-118. The Veda-knowing Brahma _n_ as would certainly go down to hell if\nthey use other sorts of Tripu _nd_ ras on their bodies. Only the Tilakas,\nprescribed in the Vedas ought to be used by those who are devoted to the\nVedas. Those who do not observe the duties of the Vedas would use Tilaks\napproved of by other S\xc2\x92astras. Those should use marks approved of by the Vedas\nwhose Deity is that of the Vedas. Those who follow the Tantra S\xc2\x92astras\ndifferent from the Vedas, should use marks approved of by the Tantras.\n\n\n\nMaha Deva is the Veda\xc2\x92s Deity and, ready to deliver from the bondages of the\nworld, He has prescribed the Tilakas prescribed in the Vedas for the benefit\nof the devotees. The marks prescribed by Vi _sn_ u, also a Deity of the Vedas,\nare also those of the Vedas. His other Avataras also use marks approved of by\nthe Vedas. The Tripu _nd_ ras and the besmearing of the body with ashes are\naccording to the Vedas. In the Tantra S\xc2\x92astra different from the Vedas, there\nis the usage of Tripu _nd_ ra and other marks. But they are not to be used by\nthe Vaidiks. No never.\n\n\n\nThose who follow the path of the Vedas should use the curved Tripu _nd_ ras\nand Bhasma on their foreheads according to the rules prescribed in the Vedas.\n\n\n\nHe who has obtained the highest state of Naraya _n_ a, i.e., who has realised\nMy Nature, ought to use always on their foreheads S\xc2\x92ula marks scented with\nfragrant sandalpaste.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fifteenth Chapter of the Eleventh Book on the rules of using the\nTripu _nd_ ra and \xc3\x9brdhapu _nd_ ra marks in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 16](bk11ch16.htm)\n\n'
