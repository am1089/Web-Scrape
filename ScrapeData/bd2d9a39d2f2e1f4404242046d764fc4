Savit _ri_ (the sun), having first collected his mind and expanded his\nthoughts, brought Agni (fire), when he had discovered his light, above the\nearth.\n\n2 2. With collected minds we are at the command of the divine Savit _ri_ ,\nthat we may obtain blessedness.\n\np. 239\n\n3 1. May Savit _ri_ , after he has reached with his mind the gods as they rise\nup to the sky, and with his thoughts (has reached) heaven, grant these gods to\nmake a great light to shine.\n\n4 2. The wise sages of the great sage collect their mind and collect their\nthoughts. He who alone knows the law (Savit _ri_ ) has ordered the\ninvocations; great is the praise of the divine Savit _ri_.\n\np. 240\n\n5 1. Your old prayer has to be joined 2 with praises. Let my song go forth\nlike the path of the sun! May all the sons of the Immortal listen, they who\nhave reached their heavenly homes.\n\n6\\. Where the fire is rubbed 3, where the wind is checked, where the Soma\nflows over, there the mind is born.\n\np. 241\n\n7\\. Let us love the old Brahman by the grace of Savit _ri_ ; if thou make thy\ndwelling there, the path will not hurt thee 1.\n\n8\\. If a wise man hold his body with its three erect parts (chest, neck, and\nhead) even 2, and turn his senses with the mind towards the heart, he will\nthen in the boat of Brahman 3 cross all the torrents which cause fear.\n\n9\\. Compressing his breathings let him, who has subdued all motions, breathe\nforth through the nose with gentle breath 4. Let the wise man without fail\nrestrain his mind, that chariot yoked with vicious horses 5.\n\n10\\. Let him perform his exercises in a place 6\n\np. 242\n\nlevel, pure, free from pebbles, fire, and dust, delightful by its sounds, its\nwater, and bowers, not painful to the eye, and full of shelters and caves.\n\n11\\. When Yoga is being performed, the forms which come first, producing\napparitions in Brahman, are those of misty smoke, sun, fire, wind, fire-flies,\nlightnings, and a crystal moon 1.\n\n12\\. When, as earth, water, light, heat, and ether arise, the fivefold quality\nof Yoga takes place 2, then there is no longer illness, old age, or pain 3 for\nhim who has obtained a body, produced by the fire of Yoga.\n\n13\\. The first results of Yoga they call lightness, healthiness, steadiness, a\ngood complexion, an easy pronunciation, a sweet odour, and slight excretions.\n\n14\\. As a metal disk (mirror), tarnished by dust, shines bright again after it\nhas been cleaned, so is the one incarnate person satisfied and free from\ngrief, after he has seen the real nature of the Self 4.\n\np. 243\n\n15\\. And when by means of the real nature of his self he sees, as by a lamp,\nthe real nature of Brahman, then having known the unborn, eternal god, who is\nbeyond all natures 1, he is freed from all fetters.\n\n16\\. He indeed is the god who pervades all regions: he is the first-born (as\nHira _n_ yagarbha), and he is in the womb. He has been born, and he will be\nborn 2. He stands behind all persons, looking everywhere.\n\n17\\. The god 3 who is in the fire, the god who is in the water, the god who\nhas entered into the whole world, the god who is in plants, the god who is in\ntrees, adoration be to that god, adoration!\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[238:1](sbe15101.htm#fr_730) The seven introductory verses are taken from\nhymns addressed to Savit _ri_ as the rising sun. They have been so twisted by\n_S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, in order to make them applicable to the teachings of the Yoga\nphilosophy, as to become almost nonsensical. I have given a few specimens of\n_S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara's renderings in the notes, but have translated the verses, as much\nas possible, in their original character. As they are merely introductory, I\ndo not understand why the collector of the Upanishad should have seen in them\nanything but an invocation of Savit _ri_.\n\nThese verses are taken from various Sa _m_ hitas. The first yu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ana _h_\nprathamam is from Taitt. Sa _m_ h. IV, 1, 1, 1, 1; Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XI, 1;\nsee also _S_ at. Br. VI, 3, 1, 12. The Taittiriya-text agrees with the\nUpanishad, the Va _g_ asaneyi-text has dhiyam for dhiya _h_ , and agne _h_ for\nagnim. Both texts take tatvaya as a participle of tan, while the Upanishad\nreads tattvaya, as a dative of tattva, truth. I have translated the verse in\nits natural sense. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, in explaining the Upanishad, translates: 'At\nthe beginning of our meditation, joining the mind with the Highest Self, also\nthe other pra _n_ as, or the knowledge of outward things, for the sake of\ntruth, Savit _ri_ , out of the knowledge of outward things, brought Agni,\nafter having discovered his brightness, above the earth, in this body.' He\nexplains it: 'May Savit _ri_ , taking our thoughts away from outward things,\nin order to concentrate them on the Highest Self, produce in our speech and in\nour other senses that power which can lighten all objects, which proceeds from\nAgni and from the other favourable deities.' He adds that 'by the favour of\nSavit _ri_ , Yoga may be obtained.'\n\n[238:2](sbe15101.htm#fr_731) The second verse is from Taitt. Sa _m_ h. IV, 1,\n1, 1, 3; Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XI, 2. The Va _g_ asaneyi-text has svargyaya for\nsvargeyaya, and _s_ aktya for _s_ aktyai. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara explains: 'With a mind\nthat has been joined p. 239 by Savit _ri_ to the Highest Self, we, with the\nsanction of that Savit _ri_ , devote ourselves to the work of meditation,\nwhich leads to the obtainment of Svarga, according to our power.' He explains\nSvarga by Paramatman. Saya _n_ a in his commentary on the Taittiriya-sa _m_\nhita explains svargeyaya by svargaloke giyamanasyagne _h_ sampadanaya; _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85kara, by svargapraptihetubhutaya dhyanakarma _n_ e. _S_ aktyai is explained\nby _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara by yathasamarthyam; by Saya _n_ a, by _s_ akta bhuyasma.\nMahidhara explains _s_ aktya by svasamarthyena. I believe that the original\nreading was svargyaya _s_ aktyai, and that we must take _s_ aktyai as an\ninfinitive, like ityai, construed with a dative, like d _ri_ saye suryaya, for\nthe seeing of the sun. The two attracted datives would be governed by save,\n'we are under the command of Savit _ri_ ,' svargyaya _s_ aktyai, 'that we may\nobtain svargya, life in Svarga or blessedness.'\n\n[239:1](sbe15101.htm#fr_732) The third verse is from Taitt. Sa _m_ h. IV, 1,\n1, 1, 2; Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XI, 3. The Taittiriyas read yuktvaya manasa; the Va\n_g_ asaneyins, yuktvaya savita. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara translates: 'Again he prays that\nSavit _ri_ , having directed the devas, i.e. the senses, which are moving\ntowards Brahman, and which by knowledge are going to brighten up the heavenly\nlight of Brahman, may order them to do so; that is, he prays that, by the\nfavour of Savit _ri_ , our senses should be turned away from outward things to\nBrahman or the Self.' Taking the hymn as addressed to Savit _ri_ , I have\ntranslated deva by gods, not by senses, suvaryata _h_ by rising to the sky,\nnamely, in the morning. The opposition between manasa and dhiya is the same\nhere as in verse 1, and again in verse 4.\n\n[239:2](sbe15101.htm#fr_733) This verse is from Taitt. Sa _m_ h. IV, 1, 1, 1,\n4; I, 2, 13, 1, 1; Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. V, 14; XI, 4; XXXVII, 2; _Ri_ g-veda V,\n81, 1; _S_ at. Br. III, 5, 3, 11; VI, 3, 1, 16. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara explains this verse\nagain in the same manner as he did the former verses, while the _S_ atapatha-\nbrahma _n_ a supplies two different ritual explanations.\n\n[240:1](sbe15101.htm#fr_734) For this verse, see Taitt. Sa _m_ h. IV, 1, 1, 2,\n1; Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XI, 5; Atharva-veda XVIII, 3, 39; _Ri_ g-veda X, 13, 1.\nThe Va _g_ asaneyins read vi _s_ loka etu for vi _s_ loka yanti; sure _h_ for\nsura _h_ ; _s_ _ri_ _n_ vantu for _s_ _ri_ _n_ vanti; and the _Ri_ g-veda\nagrees with them. The dual vam is accounted for by the verse belonging to a\nhymn celebrating the two _s_ akatas, carts, bearing the offerings\n(havirdhane); most likely, however, the dual referred originally to the dual\ndeities of heaven and earth. I prefer the text of the _Ri_ g-veda and the Va\n_g_ asaneyins to that of the Taittiriyas, and have translated the verse\naccordingly. In the Atharva-veda XVIII, 39, if we may trust the edition, the\nverse begins with svasasthe bhavatam indave na _h_ , which is really the end\nof the next verse (Rv. X, 13, 2), while the second line is, vi _s_ loka eti\npathyeva suri _h_ _s_ _ri_ _n_ vantu vi _s_ ve am _ri_ tasa etat. I see no\nsense in pathyeva sura _h_. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara explains pathyeva by pathi sanmarge,\nathava pathya kirti _h_ , while his later commentary, giving _s_ _ri_ _n_\nvantu and putra _h_ suratmano hira _n_ yagarbhasya, leads one to suppose that\nhe read sure _h_ _s_ _ri_ _n_ vantu. _S_ ayana (Taitt. Sa _m_ h. IV, 1, 1, 2)\nexplains pathya sura iva by girva _n_ amarga antarikshe suryara _s_ mayo yatha\nprasaranti tadvat. The same, when commenting on the _Ri_ g-veda (X, 13, 1),\nSays: pathya-iva sure _h_ , yatha stotu _h_ svabhuta pathya pari _n_\namasukhavahahutir vi _s_ van devan prati vividha _m_ ga _k_ _kh_ ati tadvat.\nMahidhara (Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XI, 5) refers sure _h_ (pa _n_ _d_ itasya) to _s_\nloka _h_ , and explains pathyeva by patho 'napeta pathya ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ amargaprav\n_ri_ ttahuti _h_.\n\n[240:2](sbe15101.htm#fr_735) Yu _g_ e cannot stand for yu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ e, as all\ncommentators and translators suppose, but is a datival infinitive. Neither can\nyu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ate in the following verse stand for yu\xe1\xb9\x85kte (see Boehtlingk, s.\nv.), or be explained as a subjunctive form. A. reads adhirudhyate, B.\nabhirudhyate, with a marginal note abhinudyate. It is difficult to say whether\nin lighting the fire the wind should be directed towards it, or kept from it.\n\n[240:3](sbe15101.htm#fr_736) That is, at the Soma sacrifice, after the fire\nhas been kindled and stirred by the wind, the poets, on partaking of the\njuice, are p. 241 inspirited for new songs. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, however, suggests\nanother explanation as more appropriate for the Upanishad, namely, 'Where the\nfire, i.e. the Highest Self, which burns all ignorance, has been kindled (in\nthe body, where it has been rubbed with the syllable Om), and where the breath\nhas acted, i.e. has made the sound peculiar to the initial stages of Yoga,\nthere Brahman is produced.' In fact, what was intended to be taught was this,\nthat we must begin with sacrificial acts, then practise yoga, then reach\nsamadhi, perfect knowledge, and lastly bliss.\n\n[241:1](sbe15101.htm#fr_737) We must read k _ri_ _n_ avase, in the sense of\n'do this and nothing will hurt thee,' or, if thou do this, thy former deeds\nwill no longer hurt thee.\n\n[241:2](sbe15101.htm#fr_738) Cf. Bhagavadgita VI, 13. Sama _m_ kaya _s_\nirogriva _m_ dharayan. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara says: tri _n_ y unnatany urogriva _s_ ira\n_m_ sy unnatani yasmin _s_ arire.\n\n[241:3](sbe15101.htm#fr_739) Explained by _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara as the syllable Om.\n\n[241:4](sbe15101.htm#fr_740) Cf. Bhagavadgita V, 27. Pra _n_ apanau samau k\n_ri_ tva nasabhyantara _k_ ari _n_ au. See Telang's notes, Sacred Books of the\nEast, vol. viii, p. 68 seq.\n\n[241:5](sbe15101.htm#fr_741) A similar metaphor in Ka _th_. Up. III, 4-6;\nSacred Books of the East, vol. xv, p. 13.\n\n[241:6](sbe15101.htm#fr_742) The question is whether _s_ abda _g_\nalasrayadibhi _h_ should be referred to mano 'nukule, as I have translated it,\nor to vivar _g_ ite, as _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara seems to take it, because he renders _s_\nabda, sound, by noise, and p. 242 a _s_ raya by ma _n_ _d_ apa, a booth. See\nBhagavadgita VI, 11. In the Maitr. Up. VI, 30, Ramatirtha explains su _k_ au\nde _s_ e by girinadipulinaguhadi _s_ uddhastane. See also \xc3\x82 _s_ v. G _ri_ hya-\nsutras III, 2, 2.\n\n[242:1](sbe15101.htm#fr_743) Or, it may be, a crystal and the moon.\n\n[242:2](sbe15101.htm#fr_744) The Yogagu _n_ a is described as the quality of\neach element, i.e. smell of the earth, taste of water, &c. It seems that the\nperception of these gunas is called yogaprav _ri_ tti. Thus by fixing the\nthought on the tip of the nose, a perception of heavenly scent is produced; by\nfixing it on the tip of the tongue, a perception of heavenly taste; by fixing\nit on the point of the palate, a heavenly colour; by fixing it on the middle\nof the tongue, a heavenly touch; by fixing it on the roof of the tongue, a\nheavenly sound. By means of these perceptions the mind is supposed to be\nsteadied, because it is no longer attracted by the outward objects themselves.\nSee Yoga-sutras I, 35.\n\n[242:3](sbe15101.htm#fr_745) Or no death, na m _ri_ tyu _h_ , B.\n\n[242:4](sbe15101.htm#fr_746) Paresham pa _th_ e tadvat sa tattvam prasamikshya\ndehiti.\n\n[243:1](sbe15101.htm#fr_747) Sarvatattvair avidyatatkaryair vi _s_ uddham asa\n_m_ sp _ri_ sh _t_ am.\n\n[243:2](sbe15101.htm#fr_748) This verse is found in the Va _g_. Sa _m_ h.\nXXXII, 4; Taitt. \xc3\x82r. X, 1, 3, with slight modifications. The Vagasaneyins read\nesho ha (so do A. B.) for esha hi; sa eva _g_ ata _h_ (A. B.) for sa vi _g_\nata _h_ ; _g_ anas (A. B.) for _g_ ana _m_ s. The \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka has sa vi _g_\nayamana _h_ for sa vi _g_ ata _h_ , pratya\xe1\xb9\x85mukhas for pratya _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ana _m_\ns, and vi _s_ vatomukha _h_ for sarvatomukha _h_. Colebrooke (Essays, I, 57)\ngives a translation of it. If we read gana _h_ , we must take it as a\nvocative.\n\n[243:3](sbe15101.htm#fr_749) B. (not A.) reads yo rudro yo 'gnau.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Adhyaya III](sbe15102.htm)\n\n"
