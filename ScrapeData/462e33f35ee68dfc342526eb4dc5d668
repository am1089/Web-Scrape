 \nClothed in attire of crimson hue  \nThey show like tigers fierce to view.  \nGreat chains of gold each warder deck,  \nGleaming like fire beneath his neck.  \nThe age of each fair youth appears  \nSome score and five of human years:  \nThe ever-blooming prime which they  \nWho live in heaven retain for aye:  \nSuch mien these lordly beings wear,  \nHeroic youths, most bright and fair.  \nNow, brother, in this spot, I pray,  \nWith the Videhan lady stay,  \nTill I have certain knowledge who  \nThis being is, so bright to view.'  \n   He spoke, and turning from the spot  \nSought S'arabhanga's hermit cot.  \nBut when the lord of S'achi  2 saw  \nThe son of Raghu near him draw,  \nHe hastened of the sage to take  \nHis leave, and to his followers spake:  \n   'See, Rama bends his steps this way,  \nBut ere he yet a word can say,  \nCome, fly to our celestial sphere;  \nIt is not meet he see me here.  \nSoon victor and triumphant he  \nIn fitter time shall look on me.  \nBefore him still a great emprise,  \nA task too hard for others, lies.'  \n   Then with all marks of honour high  \nThe Thunderer bade the saint good-bye,  \nAnd in his car which coursers drew  \nAway to heaven the conqueror flew.  \nThen Rama, Lakshman, and the dame,  \nTo S'arabhanga nearer came,  \nWho sat beside the holy flame.  \nBefore the ancient sage they bent,  \nAnd clasped his feet most reverent;  \nThen at his invitation found  \nA seat beside him on the ground.  \nThen Rama prayed the sage would deign  \nLord Indra's visit to explain;  \n\nAnd thus at length the holy man  \nIn answer to his prayer began:  \n   'This Lord of boons has sought me here  \nTo waft me hence to Brahma's sphere,  \nWon by my penance long and stern,--  \nA home the lawless ne'er can earn.  \nBut when I knew that thou wast nigh,  \nTo Brahma's world I could not fly  \nUntil these longing eyes were blest  \nWith seeing thee, mine honoured guest.  \nSince thou, O Prince, hast cheered my sight,  \nGreat-hearted lover of the right,  \nTo heavenly spheres will I repair  \nAnd bliss supreme that waits me there.  \nFor I have won, dear Prince, my way  \nTo those fair worlds which ne'er decay,  \nCelestial seat of Brahma's reign:  \nBe thine, with me, those worlds to gain.'  \n   Then master, of all sacred lore,  \nSpake Rama to the saint once more:  \n   'I, even I, illustrious sage,  \nWill make those worlds mine heritage:  \nBut now, I pray, some home assign  \nWithin this holy grove of thine.'  \n   Thus Rama, Indra's peer in might,  \nAddressed the aged anchorite:  \nAnd he, with wisdom well endued,  \nTo Raghu's son his speech renewed:  \n   'Sutikshna's woodland home is near,  \nA glorious saint of life austere,  \nTrue to the path of duty; he  \nWith highest bliss will prosper thee.  \nAgainst the stream thy course must be  \nOf this fair brook Mandakini,  \nWhereon light rafts like blossoms glide;  \nThen to his cottage turn aside.  \nThere lies thy path: but ere thou go,  \nLook on me, dear one, till I throw  \nAside this mould that girds me in,  \nAs casts the snake his withered skin.'  \n   He spoke, the fire in order laid  \nWith holy oil due offerings made,  \nAnd S'arabhanga, glorious sire,  \nLaid down his body in the fire.  \nThen rose the flame above his head,  \nOn skin, blood, flesh, and bones it fed,  \nTill forth, transformed, with radiant hue  \nOf tender youth, he rose anew,  \nFar-shining in his bright attire  \nCame S'arabhanga from the pyre:  \nAbove the home of saints, and those  \nWho feed the quenchless flame,  1b he rose:  \nBeyond the seat of Gods he passed,  \nAnd Brahma's sphere was gained at last.  \n\np. 235  \n\nThe noblest of the twice-born race,  \nFor holy works supreme in place,  \nThe Mighty Father there beheld  \nGirt round by hosts unparalleled;  \nAnd Brahma joying at the sight  \nWelcomed the glorious anchorite.  \n\n        * * * * *  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[233:1](ry202.htm#fr_410) The conclusion of this Canto is all a vain\nrepetition: it is manifestly spurious and a very feeble imitation of Valmiki's\nstyle.
