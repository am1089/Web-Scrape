The above Sutra raises the doubt.\n\nThe theory of the Bhagavatas is that from Vasudeva, who is the highest Brahman\nand the highest cause, there originates the individual soul called Sa _n_\nkarsha _n_ a; from Sa _n_ karsha _n_ a the internal organ called Pradyumna;\nand from Pradyumna the principle of egoity called Aniruddha. Now this theory\nimplies the origination of the individual soul, and this is contrary to\nScripture. For scriptural texts declare the soul to be without a beginning--\ncp. 'the intelligent one is not born and does not die' (Ka. Up. II, 18), and\nother texts.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 41. And there is not origination of the instrument from the\nagent](sbe48244.htm)\n\n"
