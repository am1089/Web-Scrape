For this very reason (the individual soul is) a knower.\n\nIt has been shown that, different therein from Ether and the rest, the soul is\nnot produced. This leads to the consideration of the soul\'s essential nature.\nIs that essential nature constituted by mere intelligence as Sugata and Kapila\nhold; or is the soul as Ka _n_ ada thinks, essentially non-intelligent,\ncomparable to a stone, while intelligence is merely an adventitious quality of\nit; or is it essentially a knowing subject?--The soul is mere intelligence,\nthe Purvapakshin maintains; for the reason that Scripture declares it to be\nso. For in the antaryamin-brahma _n_ a the clause which in the Madhyandina-\ntext runs as follows, \'he who abides in the Self,\' is in the text of the Ka\n_n_ vas represented by the clause \'he who abides in knowledge.\'\n\np. 545\n\n[paragraph continues] Similarly the text \'knowledge performs the sacrifice and\nall sacred acts\' (Taitt. Up. II, 5, I) shows that it is knowledge only which\nis the true nature of the active Self. And Sm _ri_ ti texts convey the same\nview, as e.g. \'it in reality is of the nature of absolutely spotless\nintelligence.\' A second Purvapakshin denies the truth of this view. If, he\nsays, we assume that the Self\'s essential nature consists either in mere\nknowledge or in its being a knowing subject, it follows that as the Self is\nomnipresent there must be consciousness at all places and at all times. On\nthat doctrine we, further, could not account for the use of the instruments of\ncognition (i.e. the sense-organs, &c.); nor for the fact that in the states of\ndeep sleep, swoon and so on, the Self although present is not observed to be\nconscious, while on the other hand consciousness is seen to arise as soon as\nthe conditions of the waking state are realised. We therefore conclude that\nneither intelligence or consciousness, nor being a knowing agent, constitutes\nthe essence of the soul, but that consciousness is a mere adventitious or\noccasional attribute. And the omnipresence of the Self must needs be admitted\nsince its effects are perceived everywhere. Nor is there any valid reason for\nholding that the Self moves to any place; for as it is assumed to be present\neverywhere the actual accomplishment of effects (at certain places only) may\nbe attributed to the moving of the body only.--Scripture also directly\ndeclares that in the state of deep sleep there is no consciousness, \'I do not\nindeed at the present moment know myself, so as to be able to say "that am I,"\nnor do I know those beings.\' Similarly Scripture declares the absence of\nconsciousness in the state of final release, \'when he has departed there is no\nconsciousness"(B _ri._ Up. II, 4, 12); where the Self is spoken of as having\nknowledge for its essential nature, the meaning only is that knowledge\nconstitutes its specific quality, and the expression is therefore not to be\nurged in its literal sense.\n\nAgainst all this the Sutra declares \'for this very reason a knower.\' This Self\nis essentially a knower, a knowing subject; not either mere knowledge or of\nnon-sentient\n\np. 546\n\nnature.--Why?--\'For this very reason,\' i.e. on account of Scripture itself.\n\'For this reason\' refers back to the \'on account of Scripture\' in the\npreceding Sutra. For in the _Kh_ andogya, where the condition of the released\nand the non-released soul is described, the text says \'He who knows, let me\nsmell this, he is the Self--with the mind seeing those pleasures he rejoices-\nthe devas who are in the world of Brahman--whose desires are true, whose\npurposes are true--not remembering the body into which he was born\' ( _Kh._\nUp. VIII, 12, 4-5; 1, 5; 12, 3). And elsewhere \'The seer does not see death\' (\n_Kh._ Up. VII, 26, 2). Similarly we read in the Va _g_ asaneyaka, in reply to\nthe question \'Who is that Self?\'--\'He who is within the heart, surrounded by\nthe Pra _n_ as, the person of light, consisting of knowledge\' (B _ri._ Up. IV,\n3, 7); \'By what should one know the knower?\' (B _ri._ Up. IV, 5, 15); \'That\nperson knows.\' And \'for he is the knower, the hearer, the smeller, the taster,\nthe perceiver, the thinker, the agent--he the person whose Self is knowledge\';\nand \'thus these sixteen parts of that seer\' (Pra. Up. IV, 9; VI, 5). To the\nobjection that if being a cognising subject constituted the essential nature\nof the Self it would follow that as the Self is omnipresent, there would be\nconsciousness always and everywhere, the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 20.
