Then Rama heard  \nThe holy sage was come, and flew  \nTo honour him with honour due.  \nHe hastened to the car and lent  \nHis hand to aid the priest's descent.  \nThen spoke Vas'ishtha words like these,  \nPleased with his reverent courtesies,  \nWith pleasant things his heart to cheer  \nWho best deserved glad news to hear:  \n'Prince, thou hast won thy father's grace,  \nAnd thine will be the Regent's place:  \nNow with thy Sita, as is right,  \nIn strictest fasting spend the night,  \n\np. 95  \n\nFor when the morrow's dawn is fair  \nThe king will consecrate his heir:  \nSo Nahush, 1 as the wise relate,  \nYayati joyed to consecrate.'  \n\nThus having said, Vas'ishtha next  \nOrdained the fast by rule and text,  \nFor Rama faithful to his vows  \nAnd the Videhan dame his spouse.  \nThen from the prince's house he hied  \nWith courteous honours gratified.  \nRound Rama gathered every friend  \nIn pleasant talk a while to spend.  \nHe bade good night to all at last,  \nAnd to his inner chamber passed.  \nThen Rama's house shone bright and gay  \nWith men and maids in glad array,  \nAs in the morning some fair lake  \nWhen all her lotuses awake,  \nAnd every bird that loves the flood  \nFlits joyous round each opening bud.  \n\nForth from the house Vas'ishtha drove,  \nThat with the king's in splendour strove,  \nAnd all the royal street he viewed  \nFilled with a mighty multitude  \nThe eager concourse blocked each square,  \nEach road and lane and thoroughfare,  \nAnd joyous shouts on every side  \nRose like the roar of Ocean's tide,  \nAs streams of men together came  \nWith loud huzza and glad acclaim.  \nThe ways were watered, swept and clean,  \nAnd decked with flowers and garlands green  \nAnd all Ayodhya shone arrayed  \nWith banners on the roofs that played.  \nMen, women, boys with eager eyes,  \nExpecting when the sun should rise,  \nStood longing for the herald ray  \nOf Rama's consecration day,  \nTo see, a source of joy to all,  \nThe people-*honoured festival.  \n\nThe priest advancing slowly through  \nThe mighty crowd he cleft in two,  \nNear to the monarch's palace drew.  \nHe sought the terrace, by the stair,  \nLike a white cloud peak high in air,  \nThe reverend king of men to meet  \nWho sate upon his splendid seat:  \nThus will Vrihaspati arise  \nTo meet the monarch of the skies.  \nBut when the king his coming knew,  \nHe left his throne and near him drew  \nQuestioned by him Vas'ishtha said  \nThat all his task was duly sped.  \nThen all who sate there, honouring  \nVas'ishtha, rose as rose the king,  \nVas'ishtha bade his lord adieu,  \nAnd all the peers, dismissed, withdrew.  \n\nThen as a royal lion seeks  \nHis cave beneath the rocky peaks,  \nSo to the chambers where abode  \nHis consorts Das'aratha strode.  \n   Full-thronged were those delightful bowers  \n     With women richly dressed,  \n   And splendid as the radiant towers  \n     Where Indra loves to rest.  \n   Then brighter flashed a thousand eyes  \n     With the light his presence lent,  \n   As, when the moon begins to rise  \n     The star thronged firmament.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[94:1](ry082.htm#fr_268) Kaus'alya aud Sumitra.\n\n[95:1](ry083.htm#fr_269) A king of the Lunar race, and father of Yayati.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto VI.: The City Decorated.](ry084.htm)\n\n"
