He then offers the Vai _s_ vanara (cake). That Agni has now been\ncompletely restored; he now is that deity, (Agni) Vai _s_ vanara (belonging to\nall men): to him he offers this oblation, and by the oblation he makes him a\ndeity, [for](errata.htm#2) whatever deity an oblation is prepared that is a\ndeity, but not one for whom no (oblation) is prepared. It is one of twelve\npotsherds: twelve months are a year, and Vai _s_ vanara is the year.\n\n9:3:1:22\\. And, again, as to why he offers the Vai _s_ vanara (cake),--it is\nas the Vai _s_ vanara that he is about to produce that Agni: on that former\noccasion, at the initiation-offering 1, he pours him out in the form of seed:\nand what the seed is like that is poured.\n\np. 208\n\ninto the womb, such like (is the child that) is born; and inasmuch as there he\npours out Vai _s_ vanara in the form of seed, therefore he now is born as Vai\n_s_ vanara. Silently 1 it is (performed) there, for there seed (is implied) in\nthe sacrifice, and silently seed is infused; but distinctly on the present\noccasion, for distinct (manifest) is the seed when born.\n\n9:3:1:33\\. Now, that Vai _s_ vanara is all these worlds: this earth is the All\n(vi _s_ va), and Agni is its man (nara); the air is the All, and Vayu (the\nwind) is its man (ruler); the sky is the All, and \xc3\x82ditya (the sun) is its man.\n\n9:3:1:44\\. And these worlds are the same as this head,--this (lower part of\nthe head) is the earth, the plants (being) the hair of its beard: this is the\nAll, and Agni is Speech, he is the man. That (speech) is at the top thereof,\nfor Agni is on the top of this (earth).\n\n9:3:1:55\\. This (central part of the face) is the air, whence it is hairless,\nfor hairless, as it were, is the air; it is this All, and Vayu (the wind) is\nthe breath, he is the man; he is in the middle thereof, for the wind is in the\nmiddle of the air.\n\n9:3:1:66\\. The sky is the (upper part of the) head, and the stars are the\nhair; it is the All, and \xc3\x82ditya (the sun) is the eye, he is the man: it is in\nthe lower part of the (upper) head, for the sun is below the sky. Vai _s_\nvanara is the head thereof, and this built-up Agni (the altar) is the body:\nthus, having completed his body, he restores the head thereto.\n\n9:3:1:77\\. He then offers the (cakes) to the Maruts;--\n\np. 209\n\nthe Maruts' (cakes) are the vital airs: he thus puts the vital airs into him\n(Agni). [He does so] after offering the Vai _s_ vanara; for the Vai _s_ vanara\nis the head: he thus puts vital airs into the head.\n\n9:3:1:88\\. That (Vai _s_ vanara oblation) is a single one, for single, as it\nwere, is the head; the others (viz. the Marutas) are seven in number, of seven\npotsherds each; and though 'seven-seven' means 'many times,' here it is only\nseven 1: he thus places seven vital airs in the head.\n\n9:3:1:99\\. That (Vai _s_ vanara oblation) is (performed in a) distinct\n(voice), for the head is distinct; but indistinct the other (oblations), for\nindistinct, as it were, are the vital airs. Standing he offers the former, for\nthe head stands, so to speak; sitting the others, for the vital airs are, so\nto speak, seated.\n\n9:3:1:1010\\. Now, the first two Maruta (oblations) he offers are these two\nvital airs (in the ears): he offers them in the middle 2 of the Vai _s_ vanara\n(oblations), for these two vital airs are in the middle of the head.\n\n9:3:1:1111\\. And the second pair are these two (vital airs\n\np. 210\n\nin the eyes); he offers them closer together, for closer together, as it were,\nare these two vital airs.\n\n9:3:1:1212\\. And the third pair are these two (vital airs in the nostrils). He\noffers them closer together, for closer together, as it were, are these two\nvital airs. The one to be recited in the forest 1 is speech: it is to be\nrecited in the forest, for by speech one gets into much terrible (trouble).\n\n9:3:1:1313\\. And, again, as to why he offers the Vai _s_ vanara and Marutas,--\nthe Vai _s_ vanara is the ruling power (chieftaincy), and the Marutas are the\nclan: he thus sets up both the chief and the clan. The Vai _s_ vanara he\noffers first: thus, having set up the chief, he sets up the clan.\n\n9:3:1:1414\\. The former is a single (oblation): he thus makes the ruling power\n(chieftaincy) to attach to a single (person), and (social) distinction to\nattach to a single (person). The others are numerous: he thus bestows\nmultiplicity on the clan.\n\n9:3:1:1515\\. The former is (offered in a) distinct (voice), for the ruling\npower is something distinct, so to speak; and the others are indistinct, for\nindistinct, so to speak, is the clan. Standing he offers the former, for the\nruling power (the chief) stands, so to speak; and sitting (he offers) the\nothers, for the clan sits, so to speak.\n\n9:3:1:1616\\. The former he offers with the offering-ladle,\n\np. 211\n\nwhen the Vasha _t_ is uttered, with both an invitatory formula (anuvakya) and\nan offering-formula (ya _g_ ya); with the hand the others sitting, with the\nSvaha-call: he thus makes the clan subservient and obedient to the chieftain.\n\n9:3:1:1717\\. As to this they say, 'How do these (Maruta oblations) also come\nto be offered for him by the offering-ladle, at the Vasha _t_ -call, and with\ninvitatory and offering formulas?' Well, the first three feet of those seven-\nfooted Maruta (verses), being a three-footed Gayatri, are the invitatory\nformula, and the last four, being a four-footed Trish _t_ ubh, are the\noffering-formula. The one is the bowl, and the other the handle (of the\noffering-ladle), and the Svaha-call is the Vasha _t_ -call: in this way, then,\nthese (Maruta oblations) also become offered for him by the offering-ladle, at\nthe Vasha _t_ -call, and with invitatory and offering-formulas.\n\n9:3:1:1818\\. And the first Maruta (cake) which he offers on the right (south)\nside, is the seven (rivers) which flow eastwards. It is one of seven\npotsherds, for there are seven of. those (rivers) which flow eastwards.\n\n9:3:1:1919\\. And the first (cake) which he offers on the left (north) side, is\nthe seasons; it is one of seven potsherds, for there are seven seasons.\n\n9:3:1:2020\\. And the second (cake) which he offers on the right side, is\nanimals; it is one of seven potsherds, for there are seven domestic animals.\nHe offers it close to the preceding one (representing the rivers): he thus\nsettles animals near water.\n\n9:3:1:2121\\. And the second (cake) which he offers on the left side, is the\nseven _Ri_ shis; it is one of seven potsherds, for the seven _Ri_ shis are\nseven in number.\n\np. 212\n\n[paragraph continues] He offers it close to the preceding one: he thus\nestablishes the seven _Ri_ shis in the seasons.\n\n9:3:1:2222\\. And the third (cake) which he offers on the right side, is the\nvital airs; it is one of seven potsherds, for there are seven vital airs in\nthe head. He offers it close to the preceding one: he thus puts the vital airs\nso as to be close to (not separated from) the head.\n\n9:3:1:2323\\. And the third (cake) which he offers on the left side, is the\nmetres; it is one of seven potsherds, for there are seven metres increasing by\nfour (syllables respectively). He offers it close to the preceding one: he\nthus places the metres close to the _Ri_ shis.\n\n9:3:1:2424\\. And the Ara _n_ ye\xe0\xa4\xbdnu _k_ ya is the seven (rivers) which flow\nwestwards; it is one of seven potsherds, for there are seven of those (rivers)\nwhich flow westwards. It is that downward vital air of his. That Ara _n_ ye\xe0\xa4\xbdnu\n_k_ ya belongs to this Pra _g_ apati; for the forest (ara _n_ ya) is, as it\nwere, concealed, and concealed, as it were, is that downward vital air; whence\nthose who drink of these (downward flowing) rivers become most vile, most\nblasphemous, most lascivious in their speech. Whenever he here speaks of them\nas belonging to the Maruts, he makes them food for him (Agni) 1 and offers it\nto him, and gratifies him thereby.\n\n9:3:1:2525\\. That Vai _s_ vanara (cake), doubtless, is yonder sun, and the\nMaruta (cakes) are those rays. They are of seven potsherds each, for the\ntroops of the Maruts consist of seven each.\n\np. 213\n\n9:3:1:2626\\. He offers (the first Maruta cake), with (Va _g_. S. XVII, 80),\n'The clear-lighted, and the bright- lighted, and the true-lighted, and the\nlight, and the clear, and the law-observing, and the sinless one!'--these are\ntheir names: having completed that disk (of the sun, in the shape of the Vai\n_s_ vanara), he bestows those rays on it by calling them by their names.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[207:1](sbe4335.htm#fr_353) Cp. VI, 6, 1, 6. Whilst the initiation-offering of\nthe ordinary Soma-sacrifice consists only of a cake on eleven potsherds to\nAgni and Vish _n_ u, that of the Agni _k_ ayana requires two further\noblations, viz. a cake on twelve potsherds to Vai _s_ vanara, and a rice-pap\nwith ghee to the \xc3\x82dityas; cf. part iii, p. 247 note.\n\n[208:1](sbe4335.htm#fr_354) Or, rather, in a low voice, the name of the deity\nbeing pronounced in an undertone while the oblation is poured into the fire;\nsee VI, 6, 1, 11. No special formula is, however, used on either occasion.\n\n[209:1](sbe4335.htm#fr_355) See [VIII, 1, 1, 2](sbe4303.htm#8:1:1:2). Also VI,\n5, 3, 11, where the translation should be altered accordingly.\n\n[209:2](sbe4335.htm#fr_356) In baking the cakes, the Vai _s_ vanara is placed\non the centre of the fire, and the first two Maruta cakes are placed north and\nsouth of it, then the following pair of cakes behind the first, but more\nclosely together, and behind these the third pair, still more closely\ntogether, and finally the last cake forming, as it were, the apex of a phalanx\nof Maruta cakes (or wind-deities) protecting (that of) Agni Vai _s_ vanara. In\noffering the cakes a similar method is to be followed; except that the first\npair of Maruta cakes may be offered, not in the fire itself, but on the\npreviously flattened out Vai _s_ vanara cake lying on the fire. Whilst the\nKatiya-sutra (XVIII, 4, 23) admits this as an alternative mode (though not\nvery clearly expressed), our passage seems to require it as the only possible\nmode. Both the Vai _s_ vanara and the Maruta cakes are offered whole.\n\n[210:1](sbe4335.htm#fr_357) 'Ara _n_ ye\xe0\xa4\xbdnu _k_ ya' is the technical term\napplied to the odd, or seventh, Maruta oblation. According to Saya _n_ a it is\nso called after an anuvaka of the Sa _m_ hita, to be recited only in the\nforest. Possibly, however, it is to the particular formula (Va _g_. S. XXXIX,\n7), also called 'vimukha' (? to be pronounced 'with averted face'), and\ncontaining the names of the seven most terrible Maruts, that the name applies.\n\n[212:1](sbe4335.htm#fr_358) Probably, inasmuch as the Maruts (and the Maruta\noblations) represent the clansmen who are considered the legitimate 'food' or\nthe chief, Agni Vai _s_ vanara.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IX, 3, 2.
