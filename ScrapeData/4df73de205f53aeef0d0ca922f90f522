From there it comes to kiss baby's eyes.\n\nThe smile that flickers on baby's lips when he sleeps--does anybody know where\nit was born? Yes, there is a rumour that a young pale beam of a crescent moon\ntouched the edge of a vanishing autumn cloud, and there the smile was first\nborn in the dream of a dew-washed morning--the smile that flickers on baby's\nlips when he sleeps.\n\nThe sweet, soft freshness that blooms on baby's limbs--does anybody know where\nit was hidden so long? Yes, when the mother was a young girl it lay pervading\nher heart in tender and silent mystery of love--the sweet, soft freshness that\nhas bloomed on baby's limbs.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Baby's Way](cm06.htm)\n\n"
