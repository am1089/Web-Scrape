Documents.\n\n* 135. 135 Documents should be known to be of two sorts: (the first), in the handwriting of the party himself;\n\np. 76\n\n[paragraph continues] (the second), in that of another person, (the former\nbeing valid) without subscribing witnesses, the latter requiring to be\nattested. The validity of both depends on local usage.\n\n* 136. 136 That document is said to be valid which is not adverse to the custom of the country, the contents of which answer to the rules regarding pledges and other kinds of security), and which is consistent in import and language.\n\n* 137. 137 That document is invalid which has been executed by a person intoxicated, by one charged (with a crime), by a woman, or by a child, and that which has been caused to be written by forcible means, by intimidation, or by deception.\n\n138. 138 A bond ceases to be valid in that case also, if the witnesses, creditor, debtor, and scribe be dead,\n\np. 77\n\nunless its validity can be established by the existence of a pledge.\n\n* 139. 139 Pledges are declared to be of two kinds, movable and immovable pledges; both are valid when there is (actual) enjoyment, and not otherwise.\n\n* 140. 140 If a document has been produced in due time, if (the demand recorded in it) has been (repeatedly) urged, and (publicly) proclaimed, it remains valid for ever, even after the death of the witnesses.\n\n141. 141 A document which is unknown and has never been heard of before does not obtain validity when it is brought forward, even though the witnesses be living.\n\n* 142. 142 When a document has been transferred\n\np. 78\n\ninto another country, or burnt, or badly written, or stolen, a delay must be\ngranted, in case it should exist still; if it be no longer in existence, the\nevidence of those who have seen it decides the matter.\n\n143. 143 If a doubt should subsist, as to whether a certain document be authentic or fabricated, its authenticity has to be established by examining the handwriting (of the party), the tenour of the document, peculiar marks, circumstantial evidence, and the probabilities of the case.\n\n* 144. 144 If a document is signed by a stranger and\n\np. 79\n\nmeant for a different purpose, it has to be examined, in case its genuineness\nshould be suspected, by inquiring into the connexion (previously existing\nbetween the two parties) and into the (probability of) title, and by resorting\nto reasonable inference.\n\n145. 145 An (obligation which has been stated in) writing can only be annulled by (another) writing, and an attested bond by witnesses. A writing is superior to witnesses; witnesses are not superior to a writing.\n\n* 146. 146 If a document is split, or torn, or stolen, or effaced, or lost, or badly written, another document has to be executed. This is the rule regarding documents.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[75:135](sbe3317.htm#fr_230) A document in the handwriting of the party\nhimself has the advantage of being valid without subscribing witnesses. The\ncustom p. 76 of the country, i.e. the usages prevailing in each country with\nregard to the validity of documents, is supreme. A. Vish _n_ u VII, 1-5; Ya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 84-88.\n\n[76:136](sbe3317.htm#fr_231) I have translated the reading\nvyaktadhividhilaksha _n_ am. That writing is not adverse to the custom of the\ncountry which does not record an invalid gift, or a disposition in regard to a\nminor, &c. If the contents of a document are in accordance with the rules\nregarding pledges, sureties, &c., and if its import and language is free from\nobscurity and breaks, it is valid. A. Vish _n_ u VII, 11.\n\n[76:137](sbe3317.htm#fr_232) What has been written by one intoxicated, or\ncharged with the murder of a Brahman or other heavy crime, or by a woman or\nchild; what has been caused to be written by forcible means, the writer not\nbeing concerned in the subject matter; and what has been written by one\nintimidated, or under a delusion; all such documents are invalid. A. Vish _n_\nu VII, 6-10; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 89.\n\n[76:138](sbe3317.htm#fr_233) The invalidity of those documents, where the\ncreditor, debtor, witnesses, and writer are all dead, is declared for that\nreason, because such documents may be suspected of forgery. Even after the\nactual death of all those persons, however, a document retains its validity,\nwhere a pledge is in existence and in the possession of the creditor. A.\n\n[77:139](sbe3317.htm#fr_234) A pledge which is only mentioned in a document,\nwithout being actually enjoyed, has no legal validity. A.\n\n[77:140](sbe3317.htm#fr_235) A document or bond which the descendants of the\ncreditor have repeatedly shown to the descendants of the debtor whenever\ninterest was due (prarthita _m_ ), or which they have again and again read\nout, retains its validity for the respective descendants of the creditor and\ndebtor, even after the death of the witnesses and all other persons concerned.\nA. I have translated the term prarthita _m_ as an [independent](errata.htm#0)\nclause.\n\n[77:141](sbe3317.htm#fr_236) A document or bond, the contents of which are\nunknown to the descendants of the debtor, about which they have never heard\nfrom their ancestors, and which has been suddenly presented to them only in a\nbusiness transaction, is not considered valid, even though the witnesses be\nliving. A.\n\n[77:142](sbe3317.htm#fr_237) This rule is equally applicable to a plaintiff\nand to a defendant in a lawsuit. 1. If a creditor suing a debtor is unable to\nproduce the bond on demand, the judge shall give him time to search for it. If\nthe bond has been destroyed by fire or by some other accident, the fact of its\nformer existence may be established by the testimony of honest persons, who\nhave acted as scribe or as subscribing witnesses, or who happened to be\npresent while the bond was being executed. The statements of such persons are\nequally decisive where the marks or part of the writing in a document has been\nobliterated. 2. A debtor having been asked in p. 78 court to discharge a\ncertain debt, on the strength of a bond signed by himself, says: 'It is true.\nI had written that document. However, the money was not handed over to me, and\nI omitted to cause the document to be torn, because it did not happen to be at\nhand. A few days later the father of my would-be creditor informed me that he\nhad lost the bond and could not find it anywhere; that, however, he was going\nto give me a written deed recording its loss. So he actually did, and I have\ndeposited that written deed in a certain box while living in that house.' If\nthe debtor pleads an excuse of this sort, he must be allowed some delay to\nsearch for the document in question. If it is no longer in existence, the\nstatements of those who saw it shall decide the matter. A.\n\n[78:143](sbe3317.htm#fr_238) 'The handwriting,' another specimen of the\nhandwriting of the party. 'The tenour of the document,' the names of the\nsubscribing witnesses. 'Peculiar marks,' flourishes in the handwriting of the\nscribe. 'Circumstantial evidence,' 'these two facts go together,' or 'they do\nnot go together.' 'The probabilities of the case,' 'how has he got hold of\nthis document?' or 'is he nervous or is his manner of speaking composed and\nquiet?' By such expedients as these shall doubts regarding the genuineness of\na document be removed. A. Vish _n_ u VII, 12; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 92.\n\n[78:144](sbe3317.htm#fr_239) If a document has passed by purchase or\nacceptance from the original owner, who signed it, into the possession of a\nstranger, who claims the loan recorded in it from the debtor, the judge must\nexamine the document. Kalya _n_ abha _t_ _t_ a has composed three verses in\nexplanation of the technical terms agama, sa _m_ bandha, and hetu. Sa _m_\nbandha, 'connexion,' according to him, may be founded on descent, caste,\nmarriage, friendship, and social intercourse. p. 79 \xc3\x82gama, 'a title,' may be\nfounded on inheritance, purchase, mortgaging, seizure, friendship, and\nacquisition. Hetu, 'reasonable inference,' may be founded on reasoning and an\nefficient cause. A. For other explanations of the terms agama and hetu in an\nanalogous passage of Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya (II, 92), see the Mitakshara. The\nMayukha agrees with Kalya _n_ abha _t_ _t_ a.\n\n[79:145](sbe3317.htm#fr_240) If the debtor states that he has paid the debt,\nhe must be able to produce an acquittance in the creditor's handwriting. In\nthe same way, if the creditor pleads that the bond has been stolen, or lost,\nor burnt, &c., he must produce a certificate from the debtor stating its loss.\nWhere, however, the bond was attested by subscribing witnesses, the debt has\nto be discharged in the presence of the same witnesses. A.\n\n[79:146](sbe3317.htm#fr_241) Where a document has met with any one out of the\ndivers accidents mentioned in this paragraph, the party by whom it was\nexecuted may be compelled to give another document instead of it. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya II, 91. Here ends the chapter on documents, the eighth section of the\nlaw of debt. A.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 11. Witnesses](sbe3318.htm)\n\n"
