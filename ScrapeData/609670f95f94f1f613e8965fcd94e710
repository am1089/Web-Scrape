The worshippers of the gods anoint thee at the sacrifice, O lord of the\nforest [1](sbe46068.htm#an_3:8:1:1), with heavenly honey\n[2](sbe46068.htm#an_3:8:1:2). When standing upright bestow wealth (on us)\nhere, or when abiding in this mother's lap [3](sbe46068.htm#an_3:8:1:3).\n\n2\\. Situated in front of the kindled (fire), accepting our sacred spell which\nprotects from old age and gives valiant offspring, driving away far from us\nlack of thoughts [1](sbe46068.htm#an_3:8:2:1), rise up\n[2](sbe46068.htm#an_3:8:2:2) for the sake of great prosperity.\n\n3\\. Rise up, O lord of the forest, on the summit of the earth. Erected by\nskilful erection bestow splendour on (the worshipper) who fits out the\nsacrifice as a vehicle [1](sbe46068.htm#an_3:8:3:1).\n\n4\\. A well-clothed youth dressed has come hither. He becomes more excellent\nwhen born [1](sbe46068.htm#an_3:8:4:1). Wise sages full of pious thoughts,\nlonging for the gods in their mind, bring him forth.\n\n5\\. He who has been born is born [1](sbe46068.htm#an_3:8:5:1) in the\nauspiciousness of days, growing up in the assembly and at the sacrifice\n[2](sbe46068.htm#an_3:8:5:2). Wise, active men purify him by pious thoughts;\nthe priest approaching the gods raises his voice [3](sbe46068.htm#an_3:8:5:3).\n\n6\\. You whom the worshippers of the gods have fastened down (in the earth), or\nwhom the axe has fashioned, O lord of the forest: may those divine posts\n[1](sbe46068.htm#an_3:8:6:1) standing (here) take care to bestow on us\ntreasures with offspring.\n\n7\\. (The posts) which have been hewn on the earth and fastened down, and to\nwhich the sacrificial\n\np. 253\n\nladles have been raised [1](sbe46068.htm#an_3:8:7:1): may they, giving bliss\nto our fields [2](sbe46068.htm#an_3:8:7:2), eagerly seek precious goods for us\namong the gods.\n\n8\\. May the \xc3\x82dityas, the Rudras, the Vasus, the good leaders, Heaven and\nEarth, the Earth [1](sbe46068.htm#an_3:8:8:1) and the Air--may the gods\nunanimously bless this sacrifice; may they raise up the banner of the\nsacrifice (the Yupa).\n\n9\\. Like swans ranging themselves in rows, arraying themselves in brightness\nthe sacrificial posts have come to us. Led up by the sages they go forward as\ngods to the abode of the gods.\n\n10\\. Like horns of horned animals the sacrificial posts with their head-pieces\n[1](sbe46068.htm#an_3:8:10:1) are seen on the earth. Hearing (us) in the\nemulating call of the invoking (priests) may they protect us in the racings of\nbattles.\n\n11\\. O lord of the forest, rise with a hundred branches; may we rise with a\nthousand branches (offspring)--thou whom this sharpened axe has led forward to\ngreat prosperity.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi. The metre is Trish _t_ ubh (verses 3 and 7 Anush _t_ ubh).\n\nThis Sukta is a collection of liturgical verses that refer to the erecting and\nanointing of the sacrificial post, and to the winding of a rope about it. See\nAitareya Brahma _n_ a II, 2; \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana _S_ rautasutra III, 1, 8 seq.; _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85khayana _S_ rautasutra V, 15, 2 seq.; Schwab, Das Altindische Thieropfer, 68\nseq.; Bergaigne, Recherches sur l'Histoire de la Liturgie Vedique, 16. On the\nritual acts referring to the sacrificial post which seem to be connected with\nancient\n\np. 254\n\ntree-worship, comp. also H. O., Religion ties Veda, 90 seq., 256.--Verses 1-5\n= TB. III, 6, 1, 1. 3; MS. IV, 13, 1. Verse 3 = MS. I, 2, 11. Verse 4 = T\xc3\x82. I,\n27, 2. Verse 10 = TB. II, 4, 7, 11. Verse 11 = TS. I, 3, 5, 1; VI, 3, 3, 3.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. The tree of which the sacrificial post is made.\n\nNote 2. The post is anointed with butter, see Schwab, l. c., 69. This butter\nis spoken of as honey also in the Ya _g_ us, which refers to this rite, 'May\nthe god Savit _ri_ anoint thee with honey,' Taittiriya Sa _m_ hita I, 3, 6, 1.\n\nNote 3. In the lap of the mother Earth.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. \xc3\x81mati has nothing to do with the verb am; it is the contrary of mati.\nSee Rig-veda IV, II, 6. amatim \xe2\x80\xa6 a _m_ ha _h_ \xe2\x80\xa6 du _h_ matim; X, 33, 2, and\nsuch passages of the younger Vedic Sa _m_ hitas as Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XVII, 54\n(apa amatim du _h_ matim ba\xc2\xb4dhamana _h_ ). The same is the opinion of Geldner\n(Ved. Studien, II, 184, note 4).\n\nNote 2. The sacrificial post is addressed.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Comp. below, III, 24, 1.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. The sacrificial post, round which a rope of grass (Schwab, Thieropfer,\np. 49) is tied, is compared here with a well-dressed youth. This seems to\ncontain an allusion to the Upanayana ceremony, at which the youth was invested\nwith the sacred girdle, and which was considered as a second birth (comp. Pada\nB: 'He becomes more excellent when born'). There is no doubt that this rite is\nas old and older than the Rig-veda; see H. O., Religion des Veda, 466 seq. It\nmay be noted that several G _ri_ hya-sutras prescribe the use of our verse at\nthe Upanayana (\xc3\x82 _s_ valayana I, 20, 9, &c.).\n\np. 255\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Does this expression refer again to the second birth (see the\npreceding note)?\n\nNote 2. The text has vidathe.\n\nNote 3. Comp. V, 76, 1. ut vipra\xc2\xb4 _n_ am devaya\xc2\xb4 _h_ va\xc2\xb4 _k_ a _h_ asthu _h_.\nThe conjecture devaya\xc2\xb4m easily suggests itself, but it is not necessary.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. In the Rig-veda, svaru means the sacrificial post itself, not, as in\nthe later ritual texts (Schwab, Thieropfer, pp. 11, 74), that splinter of the\nwood of the sacrificial post (yupa _s_ akala), with regard to which Katyayana\n(VI, 3, 17) prescribes: 'Yupa _s_ akalam asyam (scil. ra _s_ anayam)\navaguhati.' 'He hides the splinter of the wood of the sacrificial post in the\nrope (tied round the post).'--See Weber, Indische Studien, IX, 222.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. Comp. below, IV, 6, 3.\n\nNote 2. Comp. VIII, 71, 12. kshaitraya sa\xc2\xb4dhase.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. The Earth is mentioned twice, firstly together with the Heaven, in the\ncompound Dya\xc2\xb4va-Ksha\xc2\xb4ma, and then separately as P _ri_ thivi.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. On the wooden head-piece of the sacrificial post ( _k_ asha\xc2\xb4la), see\nSchwab, Das Thieropfer, p. 9.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 9](sbe46069.htm)\n\n"
