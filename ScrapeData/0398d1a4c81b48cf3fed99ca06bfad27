Each vigorous word  \nThe noble monarch's offspring heard,  \nAnd, reverent hands together laid,  \nHis answer to the hermit made:  \n'My sire and mother bade me aye  \nThy word, O mighty Saint, obey  \nSo will I, O most glorious, kill  \nThis Tadaka who joys in ill,  \nFor such my sire's, and such thy will.  \nTo aid with mine avenging hand  \nThe Brahmans, kine, and all the land,  \nObedient, heart and soul, I stand.'  \n\nThus spoke the tamer of the foe,  \nAnd by the middle grasped his bow.  \nStrongly he drew the sounding string  \nThat made the distant welkin ring.  \nScared by the mighty clang the deer  \nThat roamed the forest shook with fear.  \nAnd Tadaka the echo heard,  \nAnd rose in haste from slumber stirred.  \nIn wild amaze, her soul aflame  \nWith fury toward the spot she came.  \nWhen that foul shape of evil mien  \nAnd stature vast as e'er was seen  \nThe wrathful son of Raghu eyed,  \nHe thus unto his brother cried:  \n'Her dreadful shape, O Lakshman, see,  \nA form to shudder at and flee.  \nThe hideous monster's very view  \nWould cleave a timid heart in two.  \nBehold the demon hard to smite,  \nDefended by her magic might.  \nMy hand shall stay her course to-day,  \nAnd shear her nose and ears away.  \nNo heart have I her life to take:  \nI spare it for her sex's sake.  \nMy will is but, with 'minished force,  \nTo check her in her evil course.'  \nWhile thus he spoke, by rage impelled  \n   Roaring as she came nigh,  \nThe fiend her course at Rama held  \n   With huge arms tossed on high.  \nHer, rushing on, the seer assailed  \n   With a loud cry of hate;  \nAnd thus the sons of Raghu hailed:  \n   'Fight, and be fortunate.'  \nThen from the earth a horrid cloud  \n   Of dust the demon raised,  \nAnd for awhile in darkling shroud  \n   Wrapt Raghu's sons amazed.  \nThen calling on her magic power  \n   The fearful fight to wage,  \nShe smote him with a stony shower,  \n   Till Rama burned with rage.  \nThen pouring forth his arrowy rain  \n   That stony flood to stay,  \n\np. 41  \n\nWith winged darts, as she charged amain,  \n   He shore her hands away.  \nAs Tadaka still thundered near  \n   Thus maimed by Rama's blows,  \nLakshman in fury severed sheer  \n   The monster's ears and nose.  \nAssuming by her magic skill,  \n   A fresh and fresh disguise,  \nShe tried a thousand shapes at will,  \n   Then vanished from their eyes.  \nWhen Gadhi's son of high renown  \nStill saw the stony rain pour down  \nUpon each princely warrior's head,  \nWith words of wisdom thus he said:  \n'Enough of mercy, Rama, lest  \nThis sinful evil-working pest,  \nDisturber of each holy rite,  \nRepair by magic arts her might.  \nWithout delay the fiend should die,  \nFor, see, the twilight hour is nigh.  \nAnd at the joints of night and day  \nSuch giant foes are hard to slay.'  \nThen Rama, skilful to direct  \n   His arrow to the sound,  \nWith shafts the mighty demon checked  \n   Who rained her stones around.  \nShe sore impeded and beset  \nBy Rama and his arrowy net,  \nThough skilled in guile and magic lore,  \nRushed on the brothers with a roar.  \nDeformed, terrific, murderous, dread,  \nSwift as the levin on she sped,  \nLike cloudy pile in autumn's sky,  \nLifting her two vast arms on high,  \nWhen Rama smote her with a dart,  \nShaped like a crescent, to the heart.  \nSore wounded by the shaft that came  \nWith lightning speed and surest aim,  \nBlood spouting from her mouth and side.  \nShe fell upon the earth and died.  \nSoon as the Lord who rules the sky  \nSaw the dread monster lifeless lie,  \nHe called aloud, Well done! well done!  \nAnd the Gods honoured Raghu's son.  \nStanding in heaven the Thousand-eyed,  \nWith all the Immortals, joying cried:  \n'Lift up thine eyes, O Saint, and see  \nThe Gods and Indra nigh to thee.  \nThis deed of Rama's boundless might  \nHas filled our bosoms with delight,  \nNow, for our will would have it so,  \nTo Raghu's son some favour show.  \nInvest him with the power which naught  \nBut penance gains and holy thought,  \nThose heavenly arms on him bestow  \nTo thee entrusted long ago  \nBy great Krisas'va best of kings,  \nSon of the Lord of living things,  \nMore fit recipient none can be  \nThan he who joys it following thee  \nAnd for our sakes the monarch's seed  \nHas yet to do a mighty deed.'  \n\nHe spoke; and all the heavenly train  \nRejoicing sought their homes again,  \nWhile honour to the saint they paid.  \nThen came the evening's twilight shade,  \nThe best of hermits overjoyed  \nTo know the monstrous fiend destroyed,  \nHis lips on Rama's forehead pressed,  \nAnd thus the conquering chief addressed:  \n'O Rama gracious to the sight.  \nHere will we pass the present night,  \nAnd with the morrow's earliest ray  \nBend to my hermitage our way.'  \nThe son of Das'aratha heard,  \nDelighted, Vis'vamitra's word,  \nAnd as he bade, that night he spent  \nIn Tadaka's wild wood, content.  \nAnd the grove shone that happy day,  \nFreed from the curse that on it lay,  \nLike Chaitraratha  [1](ry031.htm#fn_163) fair and gay.  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXIX. : The Celestial Arms.](ry031.htm)\n\n"
