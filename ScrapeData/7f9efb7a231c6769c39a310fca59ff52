The Ri _s_ is said :-- \xc2\x93O highly fortunate one! A great doubt has arisen\non your statement. This is ascertained by all the wise men as written in the\nVedas, Puranas and other Sastras that Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and Mahes'var, these\nthree Devas are eternal. None is superior to them in this Brahma _nd_ a.\nBrahma creates all the beings, Vi _sn_ u preserves and Mahes'var destroys all\nin due time. These are the causes of creation, preservation and destruction.\nThe Trinity Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and Mahes'a are really one form, indeed, Trinity\nin Unity and Unity in Trinity.\n\n\n\nBeing endowed respectively with Sattva, Raja and Tamo Gu _n_ as they do their\nrespective works. Amongst these, again, Purushottam \xc3\x82dideva Jagannath Hari,\nthe husband of Kamala is the best; for he is capable of doing all the actions;\nno other than the Vi _sn_ u, of unrivalled prowess is so capable. How is it,\nthen that Yogamaya has overpowered Hari with sleep and made him altogether\nsenseless? O highly fortunate one! whither did, then, go that extraordinary\nself knowledge and power, etc., of Hari while alive? This is our greatest\ndoubt; so kindly advise us that our this doubt be removed and our well-being\nbe thus ensured.\n\n\n\n8-30. What is that S\xc2\x92akti? Which you mentioned to us before; as well by whom\nVi _sn_ u is conquered? Whence is She born? What is the power of that S\xc2\x92akti\nand what is Her nature? O Suvrata! explain to us these fully.\n\n\n\nHow was it that Yogamaya overpowered with sleep the Highest Deity Bhagavan Vi\n_sn_ u who is everlasting-intelligence bliss! who is the God of all, the Guru\nof the whole world, the Creator, Preserver and Destroyer, who is omni-present,\nan incarnate of purity and holiness and beyond Rajogu _n_ a; how was such a\npersonage brought under the control of sleep? O Suta! You are very intelligent\nand the pupil of Vyasa Deva; destroy our this doubt by the sword of wisdom.\n\n\n\nHearing this, Suta said :--\xc2\x93O highly fortunate Munis! There is none in the\nthree Lokas who can clear your this doubt; the mind-born sons of Brahma,\nNarada, Kapila and other eternal sons get bewildered by these questions; what\ncan I, then, say on this very difficult point! See, some persons call Bhagavan\nVi _sn_ u omnipresent, the preserver of all and the best of all the Devas;\naccording to them all this universe moving and non-moving, is created by Vi\n_sn_ u; they bow down before\n\n\n\np. 27\n\nthe Highest Narayan Hrisikes'a Janardana Vasudeva and worship Him, whereas\nothers worship Mahadeva S\xc2\x92ankara, having Gauri for the other half of his body,\nendowed with all powers, residing in Kailas'a, surrounded by hosts of bhutas,\nthat destroyed the Daksha's sacrifice, who is mentioned in the Vedas as\nS\xc2\x92as'is'ekhara (having moon on his forehead), with three eyes and five faces\nand holding trident in his hand and known as Vri _s_ adhaja and Kaparddi. O\nhighly intelligent ones! There are some other persons, that know the Vedas and\nworship the Sun everyday in the morning, mid-day and in the evening with\nvarious hymns.\n\n\n\nIn all the Vedas, it is stated that the worship of the sun is excellent and\nthey have named the high-souled sun as Paramatma (the Highest Deity). Whereas\nthere are other Vedavits (the knowers of the Vedas) who worship the Devas,\nFire, Indra, and Varu _n_ a. But the Mahar _s_ is say, that as Ganga Devi (the\nriver Ganges), though one, is expressing Herself by many channels, so the one\nVi _sn_ u is expressing in all the Deva forms. Those who are big Pundits,\ndeclare perception, inference, and verbal testimony as the three modes of\nproofs. The Naiyayik Pundits add to the above three, a fourth proof which they\ncall upama, resemblance, similitude and some other intelligent Pundits add\nanother fifth proof called Arthapatti, an. inference from circumstances,\npresumption, implication. It is deduction of a matter from that which could\nnot else be; it is assumption of a thing, not itself perceived but necessarily\nimplied by another which is seen, heard or proved; whereas the authors of the\nPura _n_ as add two other, called Saksi and Aitijhya, thus advocating. seven\nmodes of proofs. Now the Vedanta S\xc2\x92astra says that the supreme being (Param\nBrahma), the Prime cause of the Universe, cannot be comprehended by the above-\nmentioned seven proofs. Therefore, first of all, adopt the reason leading to\nsure belief, the Buddhi, according to the words of the Vedas and discriminate\nand discuss again and again and draw your inference about Brahma. And the\nintelligent person should adopt what is seen by perception as self-evident and\nwhat is inferred by the observance of good conduct. The wise persons say, and\nit is also stated in the Pura _n_ as, that the Prime Force is present in\nBrahma as the Creative Force; is present in Hari as the Preservative Force; is\npresent in Hara as the Destructive Force; is present in Kurma (tortoise) and\nin Ananta (the thousand headed Snake) as the earth supporting Force; is\npresent in fire as the Burning Force, is present in air as the moving Force,\nand so is present everywhere in various manifestations of forces.\n\n\n\n31-51. In this whole Universe, whoever he may be, all are incapable of any\naction if he be deprived of his force; what more than this, if S\xc2\x92iva be\ndeprived of Kula Kundalini S\xc2\x92akti, He becomes a lifeless corpse; O great\n\n\n\np. 28\n\n\n\nascetic Ri _s_ is! She is present everywere thus in every thing in this\nuniverse from the highest Brahma to the lowermost blade of grass, all moving\nand non-moving things. Verily everything becomes quite inert, if deprived of\nforce; whether in conquering one's enemies, or in going from one place to\nanother or in eating -- one finds oneself quite incapable, if deprived of\nforce. Thus the omnipresent S\xc2\x92akti, the wise call by the name of Brahma. Those\nwho are verily intelligent should always worship Her in various ways and\ndetermine thoroughly the reality of Her by every means. In Vi _sn_ u there is\nthe Sattviki S\xc2\x92akti; then He can preserve; otherwise He is quite useless; so\nin Brahma there is Rajasi S\xc2\x92akti and He creates; otherwise He is quite\nuseless; in S\xc2\x92iva, there is Tamasi S\xc2\x92akti and He destroys; else He is quite\nuseless. Thus, arguing again and again in one's mind, everyone should come to\nknow that the Highest \xc3\x82dya S\xc2\x92akti by Her mere will creates and preserves this\nUniverse and She it is who destroys again in time the whole Brahmanda, moving\nand non-moving; no one is capable to do his respective work be he Brahma, Vi\n_sn_ u, Mahes'var, Indra, Fire, Sun, Varu _n_ a or any other person\nwhatsoever; verily all the Devas perform the respective actions by the use of\nthis \xc3\x82dya S\xc2\x92akti. That She alone is present in cause and effect and is doing\nevery action, an be witnessed vividly. The intelligent ones call that S\xc2\x92akti\ntwofold; one is Sagu _n_ a and the other is Nirguna. The people, attached to\nthe senses and the objects, worship the Sagu _n_ a aspect, and those who are\nnot so attached worship the Nirguna aspect. That conscious S\xc2\x92akti is the Lady\nof the fourfold aims of life, religion, wealth, desires, and liberation. When\nShe is worshipped according to due rules, She awards all sorts of desires. The\nworldly persons, charmed by the Maya of this world, do not know Her at all;\nsome persons know a little and charm others; whereas some stupid and dull-\ndeaded Pundits, impelled by Kali, start sects of heretics, Pa _s_ a _nd_ as\nfor the sustenance of their own bellies. O highly fortunate Munis! In no other\nYugas were found acts as prevalent in this Kali Yuga, based on various\ndifferent opinions and altogether beyond the pale of the Vedic injunctions.\nBehold again, if Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and Mahes\xc2\x92a be the supreme Deities, then\nwhy do these three Devas meditate on another One beyond speech, beyond mind\nand practise, for years, hard austerities; and why do they perform Yaj\xc3\xb1as\n(sacrifices) for their success in creation, preservation, and destruction?\nThey know, verily, the Highest Supreme Being, Brahmani Devi S\xc2\x92akti eternal,\nconstant and therefore they meditate Her always in their minds. Therefore the\nwise man, knowing this firmly, should serve in every way the Highest S\xc2\x92akti. O\nMunis! This is the settled conclusion of all the Sastras. I have heard of this\ngreat hidden secret from Bhagavan Kri _sn_ a Dvaipayan. He heard it from\nNarada, and Narada heard it from\n\n\n\np. 29\n\n\n\nhis own father Brahma. Brahma heard this from Vi _sn_ u. O Munis it is well\nthat the wise even should not hear or think anything to the contrary from\nother sources; they should with their concentrated heart serve the Brahma\nSanatani S\xc2\x92akti. It is clearly witnessed in this world that if there be any\nsubstance wherein this conscious S\xc2\x92akti does not exist, that becomes inert,\nquite useless for any purpose. So know this fully that it is the Highest\nDivine Mother of the Universe that is playing here, residing in every being.\n\n\n\nThus ends the eighth chapter of the first Skandha on deciding who is to be\nworshipped in the Mahapura _n_ a Sri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by\nMahar _s_ i Vedavyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 9](bk01ch09.htm)\n\n"
