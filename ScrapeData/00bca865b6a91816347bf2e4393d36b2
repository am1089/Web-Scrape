O father of the Maruts, let thy favour come near, and do not deprive us of\nthe sight of the sun; may the hero (Rudra) be gracious to our horse\n[1](sbe3257.htm#an_2:33:1:1), and may we increase in offspring, O Rudra!\n\n2\\. May I attain to a hundred winters through the most blissful medicines\nwhich thou hast given! Put away far [1](sbe3257.htm#an_2:33:2:1) from us all\nhatred, put away anguish, put away sicknesses in all directions!\n\n3\\. In beauty thou art the most beautiful of all that exists, O Rudra, the\nstrongest of the strong, thou wielder of the thunderbolt! Carry us happily to\nthe other shore of our anguish, and ward off all assaults of mischief\n[1](sbe3257.htm#an_2:33:3:1).\n\n4\\. Let us not incense thee, O Rudra, by our worship, not by bad praise, O\nhero, and not by divided praise! Raise up our men by thy medicines, for I hear\nthou art the best of all physicians.\n\n5\\. He who is invoked [1](sbe3257.htm#an_2:33:5:1) by invocations and\nlibations, may I pay off [2](sbe3257.htm#an_2:33:5:2) that Rudra with my hymns\nof praise. Let not him who is kind-hearted [3](sbe3257.htm#an_2:33:5:3), who\nreadily hears our call, the tawny, with beautiful cheeks, deliver us to this\nwrath!\n\n6\\. The manly hero with the Maruts has gladdened me, the suppliant, with more\nvigorous health. May I without mischief find shade, as if from sunshine\n[1](sbe3257.htm#an_2:33:6:1), may I gain the favour of Rudra!\n\np. 427\n\n7\\. O Rudra, where is thy softly stroking hand which cures and relieves\n[1](sbe3257.htm#an_2:33:7:1)? Thou, the remover of all heaven-sent mischief,\nwilt thou, O strong hero, bear with me?\n\n8\\. I send forth a great, great hymn of praise to the bright tawny bull. Let\nme reverence [1](sbe3257.htm#an_2:33:8:1) the fiery god\n[2](sbe3257.htm#an_2:33:8:2) with prostrations; we celebrate the flaring name\n[3](sbe3257.htm#an_2:33:8:3) of Rudra.\n\n9\\. He, the fierce god, with strong limbs, assuming many forms, the tawny\nRudra, decked himself with brilliant golden ornaments. From Rudra, who is lord\nof this wide world, divine power [1](sbe3257.htm#an_2:33:9:1) will never\ndepart.\n\n10\\. Worthily thou bearest arrows and bow, worthily, O worshipful\n[1](sbe3257.htm#an_2:33:10:1), the golden, variegated chain; worthily thou\ncuttest every fiend [2](sbe3257.htm#an_2:33:10:2) here to pieces, for there is\nnothing indeed stronger than thou, O Rudra.\n\n11\\. Praise him, the famous, sitting in his chariot\n[1](sbe3257.htm#an_2:33:11:1), the youthful, who is fierce and attacks like a\nterrible wild beast [2](sbe3257.htm#an_2:33:11:2) (the lion). And when thou\nhast been praised, O Rudra, be gracious to him who magnifies thee, and let thy\narmies [3](sbe3257.htm#an_2:33:11:3) mow down others than us!\n\n12\\. O Rudra, a boy indeed makes obeisance to his father who comes to greet\nhim [1](sbe3257.htm#an_2:33:12:1): I praise the lord of brave men, the giver\nof many gifts, and thou, when thou hast been praised, wilt give us thy\nmedicines.\n\n13\\. O Maruts, those pure medicines of yours, the most beneficent and\ndelightful, O heroes, those which Manu [1](sbe3257.htm#an_2:33:13:1), our\nfather, chose, those I crave from Rudra, as health and wealth.\n\n14\\. May the weapon of Rudra avoid us [1](sbe3257.htm#an_2:33:14:1), may the\ngreat anger of the flaring one pass us by.\n\np. 428\n\n[paragraph continues] Unstring thy strong bows [2](sbe3257.htm#an_2:33:14:2)\nfor the sake of our liberal lords, O bounteous Rudra, be gracious to our kith\nand kin.\n\n15\\. Thus, O tawny and manly god, showing thyself\n[1](sbe3257.htm#an_2:33:15:1), so as neither to be angry nor to kill, be\nmindful of our invocations [2](sbe3257.htm#an_2:33:15:2), and, rich in brave\nsons, we shall magnify thee in the congregation.\n\np. 429\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nAscribed to G _ri_ tsamada. Metre, Trish _t_ ubh. See Muir, S. T. IV, 309;\nGeldner and Kaegi, p. 90. Bergaigne, III, 153; Leop. v. Schroeder, Indiens\nLiteratur and Cultur, 343. Verse 1 = TB. II, 8, 6, 9; verse 2 = TB. II, 8, 6,\n8; verse 10 = T\xc3\x82. IV, 5, 7; verse 11 =TS. IV, 5, 10, 3; AV. XVIII, 1, 40;\nverse 14 = VS. XVI, 50; TS. IV, 5, 10. 4; verse 15 = TB. II, 8, 6, 9.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. The words abhi na _h_ vira _h_ arvati kshameta admit of different\ninterpretation. Grassmann has: 'Der Held sei huldreich unsren schnellen\nRossen;' Muir: 'May the hero spare our horses;' Ludwig: 'Unser held moge\ntuchtig zu Rosse sein.' The passages quoted by Ludwig from the _S_ at. Br.\nIII, 7, 3, 1, and IV, 3, 4, 14, do not bear out the meaning of tuchtig sein,\nto be strong, they rather mean, to suffer, to submit to, with a dative. Yet\nvira _h_ by itself may mean son or offspring (III, 4, 9; VII, 1, 21; 56, 24),\nand if abhi-ksham in our passage could mean to be capable and strong, Ludwig's\ntranslation would be justified. But if we take vira, hero, as intended for\nRudra, as Indra also is often called simply vira, abhi kshameta would lend\nitself to the translation of 'to be gracious,' or 'to spare,' and I therefore\ntranslate: 'May the hero (Rudra) be gracious to our horse.' It should be\nunderstood in the same sense in verse 7, at least I see no reason to vary the\ntranslation as Geldner does, and also Ludwig, while Muir is right and\nconsistent. Our poet uses the verb abhiksham frequently, II, 28, 3; 29, 2\n(abhikshantara _h_?). It seems confined to the second Ma _n_ _d_ ala.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Vitaram, wherever it occurs, is always joined with vi in the Rig-veda.\n\np. 430\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. If rapas is derived from rap, to whisper, it would have meant\noriginally what is whispered, that is, slander, accusation, and then only\ncrime. Latin crimen also meant originally what is heard, Leumund. Crimen is\nnot connected with the Greek \xce\xba\xcf\x81\xce\xaf\xce\xbd\xcf\x89. The i in crimen has to be accounted for\nlike the i in liber, from lubh (libh). The r is irregular, unless we find an\nanalogy in increpare.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Havate, we expect huyate. Ludwig's explanation has not solved the\ndifficulty, and suhava _h_ points back to yo havate. Oldenberg suggests an\nanacoluthon, He who invokes--may I.\n\nNote 2. I formerly took ava dishiya in the sense of 'to unloose,' used\noriginally with reference to tethered horses. As horses are unloosed before\nthey can do their work, so the gods are, as it were, unloosed by prayer, or\nset off, so that they may fulfil what they are asked to do; see RV. I. 25, 3.\nIn the passage quoted by Ludwig from the TS. I, 8, 6, 2, the same meaning\nseemed quite appropriate: ava Rudram adimahi--yatha na _h_ _s_ reyasa _h_\nkarat, 'We unloosed Rudra, that he might make us happier.' Ludwig takes it to\nmean, 'We have bound, tied, or obliged Rudra, so that he make us happy,' but\nthe preposition ava is against this interpretation. Muir proposes 'to avert'\nor 'to propitiate,' the latter being adopted by Geldner.\n\nHowever, in an article lately published by Roth on Wergeld in the Veda (Z. D.\nM. G. XLI, 672), ava-day has been recognised as an almost technical legal\nterm, meaning 'to pay off, to compound.' Thus, Ta _n_ _d_ ya Br. XVI, 1, 12,\nwe read ya _h_ _s_ ata _m_ vaira _m_ tad devan avadayate, 'He portions off, i.\ne. he satisfies, or pacifies, the gods who were offended, by giving a hundred\ncows.' With ni _h_ , we find TB. I, 6, 10, 1. pra _g_ a\xc2\xb4 rudra\xc2\xb4n nir ava\ndayate; the same occurs in Maitr. S. I, 10, 20, where we also read, g _ri_\nheshv eva Rudram nir ava dayata esha te Rudra bhagas. See also Ait. Br. II, 7,\n1. There is a verse quoted, avamba Rudram adimahi, in TS. I, 8, 6, 2;\n\np. 431\n\nand again in MS. I, 10, 4; Ka _th_. IX, 7; Kap. S. VIII, 10; VS. III, 58, and\nthis gives us the right key to our verse, namely, 'May I pay off, may I\npacify, Rudra with my songs of praise,' dishiya being the optat. of the\naorist, adimahi the aor. ind.\n\nNote 3. On _ri_ dudara _h_ , see Benfey, Quantitatsversch. V, 1; p. 25;\nGeldner, K. Z. XXVIII, 201; Ludwig, Susses in seinem bauche habend; Bergaigne,\nmisericordieux. The meaning is doubtful.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Gh _r i_ _n_ iva, divided into gh _r i_ _n_ i-iva, is a difficult\nform. Various attempts have been made to explain it. Grassmann translates:\n'Wie Schatten von der Gluth mog unversehrt ich des Rudra Huld erreichen,'\npreferring to write gh _ri_ _n_ er va. Ludwig, in his notes: 'Bei hitze,'\ntaking gh _ri_ _n_ i as a locative. Muir: 'Shade in the heat.' Geldner: 'Vor\nSonnengluth den Schatten,' taking gh _ri_ _n_ i as an instrumental. Lanman (p.\n379) takes the same view, though he admits that this would be the only example\nof an instrumental in the masculine, contracted to i. He translates: 'As by\nthe heat unharmed, to shelter bring me.' He adds: 'It may be ablative with\nelision and crasis,' and this is likewise Roth's view. Weber thinks that we\nmay retain gh _ri_ _n_ iva in the Sa _m_ hita text, but should divide it into\ngh _ri_ _n_ i-iva, 'like a man suffering from heat' (Ind. Stud. XIII, p. 58).\nI think we must take into account a parallel passage, VI, 16, 38. upa _kh_\naya\xc2\xb4m iva gh _r i_ _n_ e _h_ aganma _s_ arma te vayam, see M. M., Preface to\ntranslation of Rig-veda, p. cxliii. Probably the apparent irregularity of the\nmetre led to the change of gh _r i_ _n_ er iva to gh _r i_ _n_ iva, but gh _r\ni_ _n_ er iva can be scanned   \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86; see M. M., l. c., p. cxlviii.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. _G_ alasha by itself occurs but once more as an epithet of Rudra, VII,\n35, 6, and twice in composition, _g_ alashabhesha _g_ a; see I, 43, 4. The\nsecond pada begins with hasta _h_.\n\np. 432\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. Namasya is difficult, but we can hardly take it for namasyamasi, masi\nbeing supplied from g _ri_ _n_ imasi. Nor do we gain by taking namasya\xc2\xb4 for an\ninstrumental. Perhaps it is best to take it as a 1st pers. of the imperative.\n\nNote 2. The meaning of kalmalikin is unknown.\n\nNote 3. I think it is best to translate na\xc2\xb4ma by name, though, no doubt, it\nimplies more than the mere name. Geldner's 'majestatisch Wesen' is right, but\nit is only one side of nama. See VIII, 20, 13, note 1.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. On vai, see Delbruck, Syntax, p. 483. On asurya, see von Bradke, Dyaus\nAsura, pp. 29, 34.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. I have changed ya _g_ atam into ya _g_ ata.\n\nNote 2. \xc3\x81rhan idam dayase vi _s_ vam abhvam has been rendered in different\nways. Grassmann: 'Du theilst alle diese Macht aus.' Ludwig: 'Du besitzest all\ndise gewalt.' Geldner: 'Du besitzest hochste Macht.' Muir: 'Thou possessest\nall this vast world.' Dayase is used, no doubt, in the sense of cutting and\ndistributing, but never in the sense of possessing. In several places,\nhowever, it has been translated by to cut and to destroy, e. g. X, 80, 2. agni\n_h_ v _ri_ tra\xc2\xb4 _n_ i dayate puru\xc2\xb4 _n_ i, 'Agni cuts up many enemies.' VI, 22,\n9. vi _s_ va _h_ a _g_ urya dayase vi maya\xc2\xb4 _h_ , 'thou destroyest all\ndeceits.' See also IV, 7, 10; VI, 6, 5. As to abhva in the sense of fiend, we\nhad it before in I, 39, 8. a\xc2\xb4 ya _h_ na _h_ abhva _h_ i\xc2\xb4shate, vi tam yuyota.\nIn other places it assumes a more neutral character, meaning monster, or\nmonstrous power; see B.-R. s. v. 'To distribute power' is not a Vedic\nconception, nor does abhva ever mean power in the sense of 'ungeheure Macht,\nor Urkraft' (Delbruck, Chrest. p. 49).\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. AV. XVIII, 1, 40, has gartasadam _g_ ananam ra\xc2\xb4 _g_ anam, and anyam\nasmat te. Garta-sad, literally, sitting\n\np. 433\n\nin the hole, probably the place of the chariot where the king sat, separated\nfrom the driver. These divided chariots can be seen in the ancient monuments\nof Assyria and Babylon. The king seems to stand in a box of his own, fighting,\nwhile the charioteer holds the reins, so as not to interfere with the king.\nSee, however, Bergaigne, III, 122 seq.; Z. D. M. G. XL, 681.\n\nNote 2. The m _ri_ ga bhima is probably meant for the lion, cf. I, 154, 2, and\nZimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 78.\n\nNote 3. As to the senas of Rudra, see TS. IV, 5, 2, 1, senani; AV. XI, 2, 31;\nPar. G _ri_ hy. III, 8, 11.\n\n##### Verse 12.\n\nNote 1. The sense would be better if vandamanam could be changed to vandamana\n_h_.\n\n##### Verse 13.\n\nNote 1. That father Manu obtained health and wealth from Rudra was mentioned\nbefore, I, 114, 2, and it is curious that the Vedic authority of Manu's Sm\n_ri_ ti should be based on the yell-known sentence, yat ki _m_ _k_ a Manur\nabravit tad bhesha _g_ am, Taitt. Sa _m_ h. II, 2, 10, 2; cf. M. M., Hist. of\nAnc. Sansk. Lit. p. 89.\n\n##### Verse 14.\n\nNote 1. The VS. reads pari no rudrasya hetir v _ri_ _n_ aktu, pari tveshasya\ndurmatir aghayo _h_. V _ri_ _g_ ya _h_ is the 3rd pers. sing. in s of the aor.\nopt.\n\nNote 2. Rudra is called sthiradhanvan; see also IV, 4, 5; VIII, 19, 20; X,\n116, 5; 6; 120, 4; 134, 2; Maitr. S. II, 9, 9.\n\n##### Verse 15.\n\nNote 1. _K_ ekitana, the vocative of the participle.\n\nNote 2. Muir seems to translate bodhi, which Saya _n_ a explains by budhyasva,\nby 'think of us now.' The TB. reads havana _s_ ru _h_.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 74. To Soma and Rudra](sbe3258.htm)\n\n"
