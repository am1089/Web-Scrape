Objects of general notoriety, such as ant-hills, artificial mounds,\nslopes, hills and the like, and fields, gardens, roads, and old dikes.\n\n6\\. When a piece of ground has been carried off by a stream, or abandoned (by\nthe owner), or when the boundary marks have been destroyed, (they shall fix\nthe boundary) according to the inference to be drawn from (an inspection of)\nthe spot, and according to the traces of possession (held by the former\nowner).\n\n* 7. 7 Should the neighbours speak falsely, when called upon to decide a question of this sort, they shall all be punished one by one by the king, each having to pay the fine of the (second or) middlemost degree.\n\n* 8. 8 The corporation, the senior (inhabitants of\n\np. 157\n\nthe district) and the rest shall also receive punishment one by one: they\nshall have to pay the fine of the first degree, if they make false statements.\n\n* 9. 9 The boundary should not be fixed by one man single-handed, though he be a reliable person. This business should be entrusted to a plurality of persons, because it is an affair of importance.\n\n* 10. 10 Should a single man undertake to fix the boundary, (he must do so) after having kept a fast, in a collected frame of mind, wearing a garland of red flowers and a (red) cloak, having strewed earth on his head.\n\n* 11. 11 Should there be no persons conversant (with the true state of the question) and no boundary marks, then the king himself shall fix the boundary between the two estates, as he thinks best.\n\n12\\. According to this rule let all contests be decided in regard to houses,\ngardens, reservoirs of water, sanctuaries and the rest, as well as the space\nintermediate between two villages.\n\n* 13. When trees have grown on the boundary (or ridge) separating two contiguous fields, the fruits and blossoms shall be assigned to the owners of the two fields in common.\n\np. 158\n\n* 14. 14 When the boughs (or offshoots) of trees grown on the field of one man should take root in the field of another man, they must be known to belong by right to the owner (of that field), because they have sprung forth in another field (than the stem of the tree).\n\n* 15. 15 A cross-road, the sanctuary of a deity, a street, and a public road must not be obstructed by (a place for) ordure, a terrace, a pit, an aqueduct, the edge of a thatch (syandanika), or the like (obstructions).\n\n16\\. Should any one cause such obstruction through inadvertency or by force,\nthe king shall impose on him a fine of the highest degree.\n\n* 17. 17 The (erection of a) dike in the middle of another man's field is not a prohibited act, as it may be productive of considerable advantage, whereas the loss is trifling. That is to be desired as (comparative) gain where there is (a slight) loss (only).\n\n* 18. 18 There are two sorts of dikes (or watercourses), one (called kheya) which is dug into the ground, and (another called bandhya) which prevents the access of water. A kheya dike serves the purpose of irrigation, a bandhya dike serves to keep the water off.\n\n* 19. No grain is (ever produced) without water;\n\np. 159\n\nbut too much water tends to spoil the grain. An inundation is as injurious (to\ngrowth) as a dearth of water.\n\n* 20. 20 If a man were to put in repair a dike erected long ago, but decayed, without asking the permission of the owner, he shall not have (the use and) profits of it.\n\n* 21. 21 However, after the death of the owner or of another man sprung from the same race (who has succeeded to his property), he may repair the dike, after having been authorized to do so by the king.\n\n* 22. 22 By acting otherwise he will get into trouble, in the same way as the hunter (of the tale). The shafts of him are spent in vain who hits again and again one who has been hit already.\n\n23. 23 When the owner of a field is unable (to cultivate it), or dead, or gone no one knows whither, any stranger who undertakes its cultivation unchecked (by the owner or others) shall be allowed to keep the produce.\n\n* 24. 24 When the owner returns while the stranger\n\np. 160\n\nis engaged in cultivating the field, (the owner) shall recover his field,\nafter having paid (to the cultivator) the whole expense incurred in tilling\nthe waste.\n\n25. 25 A deduction of an eighth part (shall be made), till seven years have elapsed. But when the eighth year arrives, (the owner) shall recover the field cultivated (by the other, as his independent property).\n\n* 26. 26 A tract of land (which has not been under cultivation) for a year is called Ardhakhila (half-waste). That which has not been (under cultivation) for three years is called Khila (waste). That which has not been under cultivation for five years is no better than a forest.\n\n27\\. A field which has been held by three generations in succession, and a\nhouse which has been inherited from an ancestor, cannot be estranged (from its\nlegitimate owner) by force of possession, except when the king wills it so.\n\n* 28. 28 When grain has been destroyed by cows or\n\np. 161\n\nother cattle crossing a fence, the herdsman deserves punishment in that case,\nunless he should have done his best to keep the cattle off.\n\n* 29. 29 When grain has been destroyed (altogether), with the root, the owner of it may claim a corresponding quantity of grain (as damages); the herdsman shall be corporally punished; and on his master he shall impose a fine.\n\n* 30. 30 A cow within ten days after her calving, a full grown bull, a horse, and an elephant shall be kept off carefully. The owner of any one out of these animals is not liable to punishment (should they do mischief).\n\n* 31. 31 For (mischief done by) a cow he shall inflict a fine of one Masha; for (mischief done by) a female buffalo, two Mashas; in the case of a goat or sheep (trespassing) with its young, the fine shall amount to half a Masha.\n\n32. 32 The (owners of) elephants and horses shall not have to pay any fine; for they are looked upon as protectors of (the king's) subjects. Impunity is (likewise) granted to (the owner of) a strayed cow,\n\np. 162\n\nof one that has recently calved, and of one unmanageable.\n\n33. 33 (As also to the owner of) one that has lost her way, or broken down, or stuck (in marshy ground), or (of) a bull marked with the sign of consecration. Four times (the amount of the damage done) is declared (to be the fine) in the case of (a cow) whose nostrils have been pierced and who abides in the field.\n\n* 34. 34 When the cattle lie down in the field (after grazing), the fine to be inflicted shall be double; when they remain (in the field for the night), it shall be four times (the ordinary amount); when they graze in the sight (of the keeper), that man shall be punished even as a thief.\n\n35\\. When cows, straying through the fault of\n\np. 163\n\ntheir keeper, have entered a field, no punishment shall be inflicted on the\nowner of the cows; the herdsman (alone) is punishable (for the damage done by\nthem).\n\n* 36. 36 When (a herdsman) has been seized by the king or (devoured) by an alligator, or struck by Indra's thunderbolt, or bitten by a serpent, or fallen from a tree,\n\n* 37. 37 Or killed by a tiger or other (ferocious animal), or smitten by a disease of any sort, no offence can be imputed either to the herdsman or to the owner of the cattle.\n\n* 38. 38 When a man claims damages for grain consumed by cattle (grazing in his field), that quantity of grain must be restored to him (by the owner of the cattle), which has been consumed in the field in the estimation of the neighbours.\n\n* 39. 39 The cows shall be given up to their owner, and the grain to the husbandman. In the same way a fine shall be imposed on the herdsman when grain has been trodden down (by cows).\n\np. 164\n\n40. 40 When a field is situate on the borders of a village, or contiguous to a pasture ground, or adjacent to a high road, the herdsman is not reprehensible for the destruction of grain (in that field), if the field is not protected by a fence.\n\n* 41. 41 On (that side of) the field which faces the road a fence shall be made over which a camel cannot look, nor cattle or horses jump, and which a boar cannot break through.\n\n* 42. 42 A householder's house and his field are considered as the two fundaments of his existence. Therefore let not the king upset either of them; for that is the root of householders.\n\n43\\. When his people are flourishing, the religious merit and the treasure of\na king are sure to be in a flourishing state as well. When (the people) cease\nto prosper, (his merit and his treasure) are sure to abate as well. Therefore\nhe must never lose sight of (that) cause of prosperity.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[155:1](sbe3343.htm#fr_454) XI, 1. The meaning is as follows: 'A dike,' an\nembankment for the purposes of irrigation. 'A field,' a cultivated piece of\nground (under water). 'A boundary,' a landmark. 'A tilled piece of ground,'\ncultivated soil. 'A waste,' uncultivated ground. When a decision has to be\ngiven in a quarrel with regard to any of these, it is called a lawsuit\nconcerning landed property, or Boundary Dispute. Viramitrodaya, p. 451.\n\n[155:2](sbe3343.htm#fr_455) Manu VIII, 259; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 150.\n\n[156:3](sbe3343.htm#fr_456) The foresters shall only be consulted in default\nof cultivators whose fields are adjacent to the boundaries of the village.\nViramitrodaya, p. 456. Manu VIII, 260. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 150.\n\n[156:4](sbe3343.htm#fr_457) 4, 5. Manu VIII, 246-251; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II,\n151.\n\n[156:7](sbe3343.htm#fr_458) Manu VIII, 263; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 153. The\nfine of the second degree consists of 500 Pa _n_ as.\n\n[156:8](sbe3343.htm#fr_459) The lower degree of punishment in the case of the\npersons here mentioned seems to be due to the fact that they may be supposed\nto be interested in the suit.\n\n[157:9](sbe3343.htm#fr_460) According to the Viramitrodaya (p. 458), this\nprohibition in regard to the determination of the boundary by a single man,\nhas reference to those only who are not acceptable to both parties and\nunacquainted with the law.\n\n[157:10](sbe3343.htm#fr_461) Manu VIII, 256; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 152.\n\n[157:11](sbe3343.htm#fr_462) In default of neighbours and other persons\nconversant with the state of the matter, and of trees and other boundary\nmarks, the king shall fix the boundary of his own accord. He shall distribute\nthe ground intermediate between the two villages, which has become the subject\nof a contest, between the two litigant parties, and fix landmarks between the\ntwo. Viramitrodaya, p. 460. Manu VIII, 265; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 153.\n\n[158:14](sbe3343.htm#fr_463) This rule seems to be intended principally for\nbanyans and the like trees covering a large area with their offshoots. The\nNepalese MS. omits vv. 13, 14, 16.\n\n[158:15](sbe3343.htm#fr_464) The term syandanika is variously explained as\ndenoting either the projecting roof or the eaves of a house.\n\n[158:17](sbe3343.htm#fr_465) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 156.\n\n[158:18](sbe3343.htm#fr_466) Kheya means literally 'what is capable of being\ndug,' and bandhya 'what is capable of being stopped.' What is meant by these\ntwo terms may best be seen from the next paragraph.\n\n[159:20](sbe3343.htm#fr_467) With the owner's permission, any man may restore\na dike, &c., which has fallen into decay. Viramitrodaya, p. 468. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya II, 157. Read prav _ri_ ttam in the text.\n\n[159:21](sbe3343.htm#fr_468) The authority of the king is required, because,\nwithout it, the profits of the dike would have to be enjoyed by the king\nhimself. _S_ ee Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 157.\n\n[159:22](sbe3343.htm#fr_469) The tertium comparationis in this simile has to\nbe sought in the vanity of the effort only. Manu (IX, 73) applies the same\nsimile to seed, i.e. semen virile spent in vain on the field, i.e. wife of a\nstranger.\n\n[159:23](sbe3343.htm#fr_470) 'Unable' (to cultivate the field) through want of\nmeans. 'A field,' one which has become a desert. Vivada _k_ intama _n_ i, p.\n64.\n\n[159:24](sbe3343.htm#fr_471) 'The owner,' or his son or other (descendant).\n'The whole expense incurred in tilling the waste,' the cost of converting the\ndesert into cultivated ground. Viramitrodaya, pp. 469, 470.\n\n[160:25](sbe3343.htm#fr_472) It appears from an analogous text of Katyayana\nthat this rule is intended for those cases where the owner is unable to pay\nfor the expense incurred by the cultivator. Katyayana says, 'If through want\nof means (the owner) do not repay the expense entailed by the cultivation of\nthe waste, the cultivator shall be allowed to keep the produce minus an eighth\npart. During eight years he may keep the (annual) produce (minus an eighth).\nAfter that period, it shall belong, to the proprietor.'\n\n[160:26](sbe3343.htm#fr_473) These definitions are inserted here, because the\nprevious rules according to the commentators apply to a desert or forest only,\nthe cultivation of which causes considerable difficulty and expense.\n\n[160:28](sbe3343.htm#fr_474) 28-42. Narada's eleventh title of law, though\ncalled 'Boundary Disputes,' is in reality a collection of all legal rules\nrelating to fields. Manu and those who follow him treat the subject of damage\ndone by cattle to crops or grass as a section of the chapter on 'Disputes\nbetween master and herdsman,' which title of law is wanting in the Narada-sm\n_ri_ ti.\n\n28\\. Gautama XII, 20.\n\n[161:29](sbe3343.htm#fr_475) The author of the Viramitrodaya (p. 450) observes\nexpressly that the term vadha denotes corporal punishment, and not execution,\nin this place. The other commentators agree with him. Manu VIII, 241; Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 161; Gautama XII, 26; Vish _n_ u V, 146. The Nepalese MS.\nomits this paragraph.\n\n[161:30](sbe3343.htm#fr_476) The reason why horses and elephants have to be\nkept off is given in paragraph 32. Horses and elephants were used for the\npurposes of war principally. Manu VIII, 242; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 163, &c.\n\n[161:31](sbe3343.htm#fr_477) Vish _n_ u V, 140-144; Gautama XII, 22-25; Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 159.\n\n[161:32](sbe3343.htm#fr_478) 32, 33. Manu VIII, 242; Vish _n_ u V, 150; Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 163. The Nepalese MS. has 'a pregnant cow' for 'a strayed\ncow.'\n\n[162:33](sbe3343.htm#fr_479) The genuineness of this paragraph appears\ndoubtful, because some of the propositions contained in it are nearly\nidentical with the rules laid down in the paragraphs immediately preceding and\nfollowing it. Besides, the language of this paragraph is obscure, and it is\nnot given in any commentary nor in the Nepalese MS. The solemn ceremony of\nsetting a bull at liberty and consecrating him to the gods, with a mark on\neach flank, is described by Vish _n_ u, chapter LXXXVI, and in the G _ri_ hya-\nsutras. Piercing the nostrils of a barren cow is mentioned as an offence by\nManu VIII, 325. It does not become clear why damage done by a cow of this sort\nshould be a greater offence than damage done by an ordinary cow.\n\n[162:34](sbe3343.htm#fr_480) 'When they lie down in the field,' after having\neaten their fill. 'When they remain,' when they spend the night in the field,\nafter grazing. Vivada _k_ intama _n_ i, _G_ agannatha, &c. 'In the sight of\nthe keeper:' thus according to _G_ agannatha (Colebrooke's Digest, III, 4,\n46). The correctness of his interpretation is confirmed by Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya\nII, 162. According to the Vivada _k_ intama _n_ i (p. 67), the meaning is\nthis, that the cattle are allowed to graze by the keeper, in the sight of the\nproprietor of the field, and in spite of the remonstrances of the latter. Vish\n_n_ u V, 145; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 160, 162.\n\n[163:36](sbe3343.htm#fr_481) 'Seized by the king,' employed in the king's\nbusiness. See Colebrooke's Digest, III, 4, 52.\n\n[163:37](sbe3343.htm#fr_482) This paragraph is omitted in the Nepalese MS.\n\n[163:38](sbe3343.htm#fr_483) Gautama XII, 26; Manu VIII, 241; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya II, 161. The Nepalese MS. inserts a spurious verse here, the first\nhalf of which is identical with Manu IX, 37, and the second half identical\nwith Narada XI, 22.\n\n[163:39](sbe3343.htm#fr_484) The meaning of the injunction to give up the cows\nseems to be this, that the owner of the cows shall not at once recover them,\nwhen they have been seized by the proprietor of the field, after doing damage\nin the field. The Vivada _k_ intama _n_ i has a different reading of this\nclause: gavatra _m_ gomina deya _m_. This is explained as meaning that 'blades\nof corn must be made good by the owner of cattle.' Similar readings are found\nin other commentaries as well. \xc3\x82pastamba II, II, 28, 5.\n\n[164:40](sbe3343.htm#fr_485) 'Pasture ground,' a meadow reserved for feeding\ncows or other cattle. Ratnakara. See Colebrooke's Digest, III, 4, 27. Manu\nVIII, 238, 240; Vish _n_ u V, 547, 148; Gautama XII, 21; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya\nII, 162.\n\n[164:41](sbe3343.htm#fr_486) Manu VIII, 239.\n\n[164:42](sbe3343.htm#fr_487) This maxim shows that the compiler of the Narada-\nsm _ri_ ti wrote for an essentially agricultural people.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Twelfth Title of Law. The Mutual Duties of Husband and\nWife](sbe3344.htm)\n\n"
