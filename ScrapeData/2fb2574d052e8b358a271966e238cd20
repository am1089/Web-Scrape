Vyasa said :-- O King! When the Queen Madhavi requested repeatedly the\nKing, He said :-- \xc2\x93O Good Auspicious One! When you have not met with any\nscruple to utter clearly these harsh and cruel words, I will do that act now\nwhich the most ruthless persons do not dare to do.\xc2\x94 Saying this, the King went\nwith his wife, very distressed, to the city. Placing her on the public road,\nthe King cried out in a voice choked with feelings and eyes full of tears :--\n\xc2\x93O Citizens! Hear you all. Do any one of you require any maidservant? This\nlady is dearer to me than my life. If any of you be able to offer price of her\nas I will declare, then let him give it out quickly.\xc2\x94 The Pundits then said\n:--  \xc2\x93Who are you? Why are you come here to sell your wife?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n7\\. The King said :-- \xc2\x93Are you asking me of my introduction? Hear then; I am a\nheartless brute and not fit to be called a man; or I am a Rak _s_ asa; nay, I\nam more than that; I am prepared to do this sinful act.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n8-11. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing this, Kaus\xc2\x92ika suddenly assumed the form\nof an old man and came out and spoke to Haris\xc2\x92chandra :-- I am master of\nboundless wealth; so I am able to give you the money you want; I am ready to\npurchase the maidservant by giving an equivalent wealth. Better give me the\nmaidservant. My wife is exceedingly delicate; she is unable to do all the\nhousehold work; so let me have the maid. But say quickly what value am I to\npay? When the Brahmi _n_ spoke this, Haris\xc2\x92chandra felt his heart, as it were,\ntorn asunder; so he could not for the moment speak anything.\n\n\n\n12-15. The Brahma _n_ a said :-- Take an equivalent amount of money according\nto the age, beauty, qualifications and capabilities of your wife and hand her\nover to me. Hear about the prices of the male and female servants as written\nin the Dharma S\xc2\x92astras :-- The price of a female servant clever, good, well-\nqualified and possessing thirty-two auspicious qualities is one Ko _t_ i gold\nmohurs; and the male servant similarly qualified fetches one Arbuda gold\nmohurs. Haris\xc2\x92chandra became very much pained to hear the Brahmi _n_ speaking\nthus; but he could not say anything. The Brahmi _n_ then placed in front of\nthe King the money over a bark and caught hold of the hair of the Queen and\nwas ready to drag Her.\n\n\n\np. 667\n\n\n\n16-21. The Queen said :-- \xc2\x93O \xc3\x82rya! Let me see once the lotus-face of my son;\nleave me once. O Brahmi _n_! Please see that it will be hard for me again to\nsee this boy. O Son! Behold! Your mother is now a slave. So, O Prince, do not\ntouch me. I am not fit now to be touched by you.\xc2\x94 The boy, then, seeing the\nmother suddenly snatched away, cried out, \xc2\x93O Mother! O Mother!\xc2\x94 and followed\nher with tears in his eyes. That boy tumbled at every step still he caught\nhold of the mother\xc2\x92s clothing by his hand and began to accompany her. The\nBrahmi _n_ , seeing this behaviour of the boy, became impatient with anger and\nbegan to beat him. Still the boy wept, saying, \xc2\x93Mother! Mother!\xc2\x94 and never\nquitted the hold of his mother. The Queen said :-- \xc2\x93O Lord! Have mercy on me\nand purchase this boy also. Though you are purchasing me, yet without this boy\nI will not be able to do your work. My fate is bad; therefore this calamity\nhas happened. Shew this favour to me.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n22-24. The Brahmi _n_ said :-- Take this money and give me the boy too. For\nthe Wise in the Dharma S\xc2\x92astras fix such to be the prices of a female and a\nmale. The other Pundits make differences in the prices, e.g., one hundred, one\nthousand, one lakh, one crore and so on, according to the different\nqualifications. But for the female, who is skilled in all actions, modest, of\ngood behaviour, and well qualified and, on whose body the thirty-two\nauspicious signs are seen, her price is one Ko _t_ i gold mohurs and for a man\nqualified, one Arbuda gold mohurs.\n\n\n\n25-35. Suta said :-- O King! The Brahmi _n_ then gave over the price of the\nboy as decided, in gold mohurs in front of the King over a bark and then tied\nboth the mother and son. He, then, gladly and without any delay, carried them\nto his home. At the time of departure, the Queen circumambulated the King and,\nkneeling down, bowed down to him and, in that state of humility, began to\nspeak :-- If ever I have done any charities, if ever I have poured oblations\non the Fire, if ever I have satisfied the Brahmi _n_ s, then, by that virtue,\nHaris\xc2\x92chandra will again be my husband. Seeing his wife, dearer then his life,\nfallen on his feet, the King became very distracted and lamented, crying,\n\xc2\x93Alas! Alas! The shadow of a tree never leaves the tree; but you being verily\nmodest and endowed with all qualifications, are now separated from me.\xc2\x94\nSpeaking thus reasonably with his wife, the King said to his son :-- \xc2\x93O Child!\nWhere will you go, leaving me here? Where shall I go now? and who will stop my\nmiseries?\xc2\x94 The King, then, spoke to the Brahmi _n_ :-- \xc2\x93O Brahmi _n_! The pain\nthat I experience in the separation from my son, I did not feel on the\noccasion of quitting my kingdom or on my being exiled in a forest.\n\n\n\np. 668\n\n\n\nO Auspicious One! The husband, good natured in this world, nourishes always\nhis wife and keeps her always in comfort and happiness. But I am such a bad\nhusband of yours, as I have left you and made you float in the sea of sorrows.\nBorn in the Ik _s_ aku family, I inherited the kingdom and its pleasures; but,\nAlas! Your getting such a husband has now been reduced to slavery! O Devi! I\nam merged in this ocean of sorrows and troubles. Who will rescue me, by\nnarrating this story of the Pura _n_ as!\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n36-40. Suta said :-- O King! The Brahmi _n_ , then, began to take away the\nqueen and the boy, whipping them, in the face of the King. Seeing his wife and\nson being dragged away in that state, the King\xc2\x92s pain knew no bounds and be\nfrequently sighed and sighed and bitterly wept aloud. Alas! My dear wife, whom\nthe Moon, the Sun, Wind or any other body could not see ere this, has become\nnow reduced to slavery today! Oh! How beautiful and gentle are the fingers of\nmy child? He has been sold off today, being born in the Solar Dynasty? Alas!\nFie on my foolish understanding! Oh my Dear! Oh my child Rohitas\xc2\x92va! Your this\nwretched condition is due to my Anarya irrespectable bad maxims! Oh! Through\nthe mockery of the Daiva, I have got this distress! Fie on Me!\n\n\n\n41-42 Vyasa said :-- The King was lamenting thus when the Brahmi _n_\ndisappeared with them, in the very tall trees and walls of palatial buildings.\nAt this time the cruel fiendish Muni, endowed with great power of asceticism\ncame there quickly, accompanied by his disciples.\n\n\n\n43\\. Vis\xc2\x92vamitra said :-- \xc2\x93O One of mighty arm! If you think it your duty to\nrespect Truth, then pay me the Dak _s_ i _n_ a of Rajasuya sacrifice that you\npromised before.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n44\\. Haris\xc2\x92chandra said :-- \xc2\x93O Rajar _s_ i! I bow down to Thee. O Sinless One!\nNow take the Dak _s_ i _n_ a of the Rajasuya Sacrifice that I promised to pay\nyou before.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n45\\. Vis\xc2\x92vamitra said :-- \xc2\x93O King! Whence have you collected these gold Mohurs\nthat you are now paying me as my Dak _s_ i _n_ a. How have you earned this?\nSay.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n46\\. Haris\xc2\x92chandra said :-- \xc2\x93O Dvija! O Sinless One! What use is there in\ntelling this to you. It will increase agony by hearing. O One of good vows!\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n47\\. Vis\xc2\x92vamitra said :-- \xc2\x93I won\xc2\x92t accept money earned not rightly.\n\n\n\np. 669\n\n\n\nGive what you have acquired by rightful means. Say truly how you have acquired\nit.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n48\\. Haris\xc2\x92chandra spoke :-- \xc2\x93O Brahmi _n_! I have sold my wife the Devi\nMadhavi for one Ko _t_ i Gold Mohurs and my son for ten Ko _t_ is of gold\nMohurs. So take this eleven Ko _t_ i Gold Mohurs from me.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n49\\. Suta said :-- Seeing the gold collected out of the sale of wife and son\nvery small, and seeing the King overpowered with pain and sorrow, Kaus\xc2\x92ika\nangrily spoke :--\n\n\n\n50-52. O King! The Dak _s_ i _n_ a of the Rajasuya Sacrifice cannot be so\nsmall; so collect quickly other money to complete it. O Vilest of K _s_\nattriyas! If you think this much to be proper for me, see first the enormous\npower of mine that I possess of my tapasya, practised duly, of my pure Brahma\n_n_ yahood, of my violent power and of my chaste study and then you can pay my\nDak _s_ i _n_ a.\n\n\n\n53\\. Haris\xc2\x92chandra said :-- \xc2\x93O Bhagavan! I have sold just now my wife; and so\nwait for some time and I will collect more gold and will pay that to you.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n54\\. Vis\xc2\x92vamitra said :-- \xc2\x93O King! The fourth part of the day is now\nremaining; I will wait till then. After this you won\xc2\x92t expect any other reply\nfrom me.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty second Chapter of the Seventh Book on the selling of\nHaris\xc2\x92chandra\xc2\x92s wife in the Mahapura _n_ am S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, of\n18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 23](bk07ch23.htm)\n\n"
