Exorcism of evil dreams.\n\n1\\. Thou who art neither alive nor dead, the immortal child of the gods art\nthou, O Sleep! Varunani is thy mother, Yama (death) thy father, Araru is thy\nname.  \n2\\. We know, O Sleep, thy birth, thou art the son of the divine women-folk,\nthe instrument of Yama (death)! Thou art the ender, thou art death! Thus do we\nknow thee, O Sleep: do thou, O Sleep, protect us from evil dreams!  \n3\\.
