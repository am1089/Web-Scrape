It consists of a circle formed by joining the thumb and the index-\nfinger at their tips.\n\n#### Authority of pratyabhijna questioned.\n\n1\\. _Question:_ If it be concluded, on the strength of _pratyabhijn a_ or\nrecognition of self-identity, that Atman is a persistent entity, (we ask),\nwhat is this _pratyabhijn a_? and what its purpose?\n\n2\\. _Pratyabhijn a_ is not enumerated among pramanas--right sources of\nknowledge--along with pratyaksha, etc. How can it be a pramana? The questioner\nis enlightened (by the seventh stanza of the Hymn).\n\np. 133\n\n#### Pratyabhijna proves Atman\'s Eternality.\n\nThe meaning of the stanza may be explained as follows:\n\n3\\. Pratyabhijnana consists in recognising a thing--in the form \'this is the\nsame as that\'--which, having once before presented itself to consciousness,\nagain becomes an object of consciousness at present.\n\n4\\. Just as (in the case of external objects) an identical thing which is\ncontinuously present is referred to in the words "this is that"--all the\naccidental circumstances of place, time and form being left out of account,--\nso also:\n\n5\\. The _pratyabhijn ana_ of Atman consists in His becoming conscious that He\nis omniscient, etc., after casting aside the notion that He is of limited\nknowledge,\n\np. 134\n\nand so on,--a notion engendered by His association with Maya.\n\nThat is to say, the recognition of Atman\'s self-identity consists in the\nintuitive realisation of His essential nature as the infinite Consciousness\nand infinite Bliss, after eliminating all limitations of Maya and its effects\nascribed to Him by the ignorant.\n\n6\\. By a recollection of the experience in a former birth, the new-born animal\nproceeds, of itself, to suck the mother\'s milk.\n\nThus, just as Atman remains the same through all the varying states of jagrat,\nsvapna, and sushupti, unchanging though the body changes in infancy,\nchildhood, youth, manhood, and old age,--so, too, He continues the same while\npassing in succession through the bodies of Devas, animals, men, and so on,--\nnot born when the bodies are born, not dying when the bodies die.\n\n7\\. It is, therefore, concluded that Atman exists the same even in other\nbodies,\n\np. 135\n\ninasmuch as, without the recollection of a former experience, it is not\npossible for the child to suck the mother\'s milk.\n\nPratyabhijna is thus a source of right knowledge; and it may be brought under\npratyaksha; only its process is somewhat different from other kinds of\npratyaksha. While in other kinds of pratyaksha the contact of the sense-organ\nwith the object is alone sufficient, in _pratyabhijnana_ , smriti or\nrecollection operates as an additional factor along with the contact of the\nsense-organ with its object. _Bhranti_ or illusion, for example, is indeed\nclassed under pratyaksha, though it is produced by the sense-organ in a morbid\nstate.\n\n8\\. Present both before and after, both at the time of experience and at the\ntime of recollection, Atman recollects the thing which has persisted in\nHimself in the form of a _samsk ara_ or latent impression.\n\nRecollection here means consciousness of something as having been experienced\nbefore.\n\nOn hearing the word \'recollection (smriti)\' here used, and without fully\nunderstanding the meaning of the definition given above of _pratyabhijna_ ,\nand\n\np. 136\n\nthinking that the Vedantin tries to establish the identity, of Atman on the\nstrength of pratyabhijna which is none other than mere recollection, an\nobjector asks as follows.\n\n9\\. (Question): If by _pratyabhijn a_ is meant _smriti_ or recollection of\nthings, then how can mere recollection be an authority as to the persistent\nexistence of Atman?\n\n10-11\\. It may be objected:--In memory (smriti) the thing (remembered) does\nnot directly appear nor is there an actual experience of the thing; nor can\nthey be both the thing and the experience (related to each other) like two\nfingers; nor is the thing an object of experience, (the thing and experience\nthus related together) like the stick and the man holding it;\n\np. 137\n\nfor, then, the same thing would apply to all cases of memory. Listen now to\nour answer:\n\nThe objection may be explained as follows:--If Pratyabhijnana is mere memory,\nit cannot prove the identity of Atman as the Vedantin supposes. Now, it is\nheld that Pratyabhijnana bears testimony to former experience of a thing. So,\nit is mere memory. And as memory, it cannot have the probative force of\npratyaksha as to the thing itself remembered, because the thing is not present\nto the senses; nor as to the actual experience itself, because the actual\nexperience passed away. It cannot, therefore, have the probative force of\npratyaksha as to both the thing and experience, regarded as independent of\neach other as two fingers are; and much less can it prove the thing to have\nbeen an object of experience.\n\nIf memory be held as a sufficient evidence as to the experience, then the same\nprobative force will have to be attached to the memory of a thing called up by\na mere word.\n\n( _Answer_ ): The Vedantin does not hold that mere recollection is a pramana,\na source of right knowledge. He only means that recollection (smriti) cannot\nbe explained in the absence of a persistent Atman. Now, as to the origin of\nmemory:\n\np. 138\n\n12\\. When a former experience has disappeared, its memory springs from a cause\nabiding in Atman and called _samsk ara_, the latent impression produced on the\nseat, of that experience\n\n13\\. (This memory) gives us to understand that Atman is persistent, as being\nconscious of the object of a former experience after the immediate experience\nvanished away.\n\nAtman, passing through an experience of the present moment, and remembering a\nformer event in virtue of the, latent impression produced in him by the actual\nexperience of that event, thinks thus "I who formerly ruled a kingdom, now\nlead, an ascetic [life](errata.htm#21) on the banks of the Ganges." He is thus\nconscious of his personal identity as persisting through two different periods\nof time. So, too, remembering the events of former births, he recognises his\npersonal identity through many births. Thus, as memory enters\n\np. 139\n\nas a factor into the process by which recognition of identity is produced,\n_pratyabhijna_ has been spoken of as memory.\n\n14\\. When the object has vanished away as also the experience thereof, the\nDivine Atman, never vanishing, never unconscious, recollects the object\nabiding in Himself.\n\nThe object has lain dissolved in Himself in the form of a samskara or latent\nimpression.\n\n15\\. It is the _pramatris_ , the percipients, that become unconscious by the\ndarkness of Maya. Illusion and Wisdom are the two potentialities of the Lord,\nlike unto the sun\'s shade and light.\n\nAtman is not unconscious even in sushupti. Though Atman does not manifest\nHimself in, any particular form in sushupti, He continues to shine by Himself,\nis self-conscious as before. It is the upadhis, buddhi, etc., which lie\ndormant\n\np. 140\n\nduring sleep; so that the idea that Atman is [unconscious](errata.htm#22)\nduring sleep is a mere illusion. This darkness of Maya, which has been as old\nas the universe, disappears on the dawn of the sun of wisdom. Both Maya and\nVidya reside in the Lord as His saktis, or powers, like the shade and the\nlight of the sun. They are the causes of bondage and liberation. They are said\nto abide in Atman as His saktis or powers, simply because He is conscious of\nbondage and liberation caused by them; not that they ever constitute the\ninherent nature of Atman, unattached and self-luminous as He always is.\nNeither can He be said to gain wisdom as though He had not possessed it\nbefore; for, He is never affected by Maya, any more than the sun is affected\nby the clouds. And, as in the case of the sun, it is a mere illusion to speak\nof Atman as distinct from His light.\n\n16\\. Maya enshrouds, and Vidya uncovers and manifests, all things. It is\nindeed Pratyabhijna, the all-witnessing Consciousness, which underlies all\npramanas, all sources of right knowledge.\n\nThat is to say, Vidya, though a state of the mind which is in itself\ninsentient, can dispel\n\np. 141\n\n[paragraph continues] Maya by the power of the all-witnessing Consciousness\nunderlying it. Or, it may mean that the consciousness--in the form "I have\nknown this"--which accompanies every act of cognition, shows that Vidya can\nremove the veil which conceals an object. Or, it may even mean that Vidya is\nPratyabhijna itself which dispels ignorance and unfolds the true nature of all\nthings, and which is none other than the very Pratyagatman, the all-witnessing\nConsciousness illumining all things.\n\n17\\. It (pratyabhijna) is the consciousness that I am Isvara, arising on the\nremoval, by wisdom (Vidya), of the veil of Maya which causes the (idea of)\nseparation that "the Isvara is one and I am another."\n\n18\\. Screened by the curtain of Maya, Isvara emitted but little light. The\ncurtain fully removed, like the sun may He shine.\n\np. 142\n\n19\\. Not from the operation of causes nor of the organs of perception (does\nthis recognition (come). To cause recognition is only to remove ignorance.\n\n20\\. Whatever pramanas (organs of knowledge) there are whereby to guide our\nconduct in life, they all operate in no wise other than by removing ignorance.\n\nAccordingly, the teaching of the Upanishads constitutes a pramana or source of\nknowledge as to the true nature of Atman, as doing no more than removing the\nveil of ignorance which has concealed the true nature of Atman, and thus\nbringing about the cessation of the bondage caused by that ignorance.\n\n#### Adhyasa or Illusion.\n\nNow the Vartikakara proceeds to show that the bondage of samsara is not real,\nas arising from an illusion caused by the confounding of Atman and the body\nwith one another.\n\np. 143\n\n21-22\\. By ignorance, the attributes of he insentient, unreal, and finite body\nare ascribed to the conscious Atman; as also the reality, consciousness and\nbliss (of Atman) are ascribed to the body; just as the mother-o\'-pearl is\nmistaken for silver which is quite a different thing.\n\n22\\. If the silver which here presents itself to\n[consciousness](errata.htm#23) be really existent, then how, according to thy\ntheory, can it be reduced to nothing (by knowledge)?\n\n23\\. Again what is altogether nonexistent can never present itself to\nconsciousness, any more than a man\'s horn.\n\nThat is to say, the silver which here presents itself to consciousness cannot\nbe altogether nonexistent.\n\np. 144\n\nIf illusion be a case of memory, then the silver would present itself to\nconsciousness as that seen on the hand of a woman or so.\n\n24\\. If illusion be due to similarity (between the things confounded\ntogether), then we should be conscious (of similarity at the time) in the form\nthat "this (mother-o\'-pearl) is similar to that silver." When the white conch\nappears (to the jaundiced eye) as yellow, or when sugar tastes bitter (to the\ndiseased tongue), there is, indeed, no similarity (between the colours or the\ntastes confounded).\n\n25\\. If it be held that the mother-o\'-pearl presents itself to consciousness,\nat the time, as silver itself,--as in fact identical with it,--then the\nillusory consciousness would have no real basis\n\np. 145\n\nwhatever; and when contradicted by experience, no residual truth would be left\n(in the consciousness).\n\nIf the mother-o\'-pearl do not enter into consciousness at all and be perceived\nwholly as one with the silver, which alone enters into consciousness, the\nwhole state of consciousness is an illusion, because it is quite opposed to\nfact. This is tantamount to saying that illusion which is a fact of\nconsciousness is based on no reality whatever, and that when investigated it\nends in nothing. If one fact of our experience be thus _entirely_ made\nindependent of reality, then what is there to prevent one from coming to the\nconclusion that the remaining portion of our experience is based on no\nreality? This view of _illusion_ would thus lead to utter nihilism.\n\n26\\. If silver, existent (as an idea) in the buddhi, appears to be external,\nthen, when a _gunja_ berry is mistaken for fire, there would be a burning of\nthe body.\n\nSome regard that the silver which manifests here is real as an idea existing\nin the mind and externalising itself. So, then, when a gunja\n\np. 146\n\nberry is mistaken for fire, the fire also must be real existing as an idea and\nexternalising itself like every thing else as the Buddhist Idealist would say.\nAccordingly, like other fires it must cause the burning of the body in which\nit lies.\n\n27\\. Illusion being an unaccountable appearance, it cannot be defined (as\n_sat_ or _asat_ ). If it could be defined, then there would be no illusion.\n\nThus, the appearance of silver cannot be accounted for in any one of the ways\nshown above; it cannot be defined as existent or non-existent. If it could be\ndefined as the one or the other, then it would no longer be an illusion, and\nno knowledge could remove it; a conclusion which is opposed to our experience.\n\nHaving thus far illustrated the nature of illusion by an example, the\nVartikakara concludes that the whole universe is a mere illusory appearance of\nthe One Self.\n\n28\\. The one (Atman) appears to be many as one moon appears to be many\n\np. 147\n\nin waters; the Fearless appears to cause fear like the rope appearing to be a\nserpent. The. Cause appears to be the effect, like gold appearing to be a\nbracelet.\n\n29-30\\. By illusion this almost nonexistent universe is imagined to exist in\nAtman--in the one self-existent (Atman), as silver in the mother-o\'-pearl; in\nthe all-pervading (Atman), as a city of Yakshas conjured up in the akasa; in\nthe Luminous (Atman), as the mirage appears in the rays of the sun; in the\nImmutable (Atman), as a thief in a pillar (which is mistaken for a thief at\nnight).\n\n30-31\\. The illusion removed, the self-luminous and existent Reality, never\n\np. 148\n\n[paragraph continues] (Himself) subject to illusion or contradiction, is\nrecognised as He is. The body and other upadhis shaken off, Atman verily is\nthe Mahesvara, the Great Lord.\n\n32\\. The True Word cites the Smriti, Intuition, Tradition and other pramanas\nin proof of this recognition of identity.\n\nThe Sruti says "Smriti, pratyaksha, aitihya and anumana pure,--by all these\nthe Sun is to be known" ( _Taittiriya-Aranyaka:_ 1\\. 2.) _Smriti_ , such as\nthe Bhagavadgita. _Pratyaksha:_ the intuition of the sages: _Aitihya:_ the\ntraditionary teaching of the Masters. _Anumana:_ inference. All these point to\nthe unity of Brahman and Atman.\n\n33\\. Thus ends the seventh chapter in brief in the work called Manasollasa\nwhich expounds the meaning of the Hymn to the Blessed Dakshinamurti.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VIII. Maya](dast12.htm)\n\n'
