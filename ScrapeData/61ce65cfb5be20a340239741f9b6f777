IX.\n\nLegend of Lakshmi. Durvasas gives a garland to Indra: he treats it\ndisrespectfully, and is cursed by the Muni. The power of the gods impaired:\nthey are oppressed by the Danavas, and have recourse to Vishn\xcc\x81u. The churning\nof the ocean. Praises of \xc5\x9ari.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--But with respect to the question thou hast asked me, Maitreya,\nrelating to the history of \xc5\x9ari, hear from me the tale as it was told to me by\nMarichi.\n\nDurvasas, a portion of \xc5\x9aankara (\xc5\x9aiva) 1, was wandering over the earth; when be\nbeheld, in the hands of a nymph of air 2, a garland of flowers culled from the\ntrees of heaven, the fragrant odour of which spread throughout the forest, and\nenraptured all who dwelt beneath its shade. The sage, who was then possessed\nby religious phrensy 3, when he beheld that garland, demanded it of the\ngraceful and full-eyed nymph, who, bowing to him reverentially, immediately\npresented it to him. He, as one frantic, placed the chaplet upon his brow, and\nthus decorated resumed his path; when he beheld (Indra) the husband of \xc5\x9aachi,\nthe ruler of the three worlds, approach, seated on his infuriated elephant\nAiravata, and attended by the gods. The phrensied sage, taking from his head\nthe garland of flowers, amidst which the bees collected ambrosia, threw it to\nthe king of the gods, who caught it, and suspended it on the brow of Airavata,\nwhere it shone like the river Jahnavi, glittering on the dark summit of the\nmountain Kailasa. The elephant, whose eyes were dim with inebriety, and\nattracted by the smell, took hold of the garland with his trunk, and cast it\non the earth. That chief of sages, Durvasas, was\n\np. 71\n\nhighly incensed at this disrespectful treatment of his gift, and thus angrily\naddressed the sovereign of the immortals: "Inflated with the intoxication of\npower, Vasava, vile of spirit, thou art an idiot not to respect the garland I\npresented to thee, which was the dwelling of Fortune (\xc5\x9ari). Thou hast not\nacknowledged it as a largess; thou hast not bowed thyself before me; thou hast\nnot placed the wreath upon thy head, with thy countenance expanding with\ndelight. Now, fool, for that thou hast not infinitely prized the garland that\nI gave thee, thy sovereignty over the three worlds shall be subverted. Thou\nconfoundest me, \xc5\x9aakra, with other Brahmans, and hence I have suffered\ndisrespect from thy arrogance: but in like manner as thou hast cast the\ngarland I gave thee down on the ground, so shall thy dominion over the\nuniverse be whelmed in ruin. Thou hast offended one whose wrath is dreaded by\nall created things, king of the gods, even me, by thine excessive pride."\n\nDescending hastily from his elephant, Mahendra endeavoured to appease the\nsinless Durvasas: but to the excuses and prostrations of the thousand-eyed,\nthe Muni answered, "I am not of a compassionate heart, nor is forgiveness\ncongenial to my nature. Other Munis may relent; but know me, \xc5\x9aakra, to be\nDurvasas. Thou hast in vain been rendered insolent by Gautama and others; for\nknow me, Indra, to be Durvasas, whose nature is a stranger to remorse. Thou\nhast been flattered by Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha and other tender-hearted saints, whose loud\npraises (lave made thee so arrogant, that thou hast insulted me. But who is\nthere in the universe that can behold my countenance, dark with frowns, and\nsurrounded by my blazing hair, and not tremble? What need of words? I will not\nforgive, whatever semblance of humility thou mayest assume."\n\nHaving thus spoken, the Brahman went his way; and the king of the gods,\nremounting his elephant, returned to his capital Amaravati. Thenceforward,\nMaitreya, the three worlds and \xc5\x9aakra lost their vigour, and all vegetable\nproducts, plants, and herbs were withered and died; sacrifices were no longer\noffered; devout exercises no longer practised; men were no more addicted to\ncharity, or any moral or religious obligation;\n\np. 72\n\nall beings became devoid of steadiness 4; all the faculties of sense were\nobstructed by cupidity; and men\'s desires were excited by frivolous objects.\nWhere there is energy, there is prosperity; and upon prosperity energy\ndepends. How can those abandoned by prosperity be possessed of energy; and\nwithout energy, where is excellence? Without excellence there can be no vigour\nnor heroism amongst men: he who has neither courage nor strength, will be\nspurned by all: and he who is universally treated with disgrace, must suffer\nabasement of his intellectual faculties.\n\nThe three regions being thus wholly divested of prosperity, and deprived of\nenergy, the Danavas and sons of Diti, the enemies of the gods, who were\nincapable of steadiness, and agitated by ambition, put forth their strength\nagainst the gods. They engaged in war with the feeble and unfortunate\ndivinities; and Indra and the rest, being overcome in fight, fled for refuge\nto Brahma, preceded by the god of flame (Huta\xc5\x9bana). When the great father of\nthe universe had heard all that had come to pass, he said to the deities,\n"Repair for protection to the god of high and low; the tamer of the demons;\nthe causeless cause of creation, preservation, and destruction; the progenitor\nof the progenitors; the immortal, unconquerable Vishn\xcc\x81u; the cause of matter\nand spirit, of his unengendered products; the remover of the grief of all who\nhumble themselves before him: he will give you aid." Having thus spoken to the\ndeities, Brahma proceeded along with them to the northern shore of the sea of\nmilk; and with reverential words thus prayed to the supreme Hari:--\n\n"We glorify him who is all things; the lord supreme over all; unborn,\nimperishable; the protector of the mighty ones of creation; the unperceived,\nindivisible Narayan\xcc\x81a; the smallest of the smallest, the largest of the\nlargest, of the elements; in whom are all things, from whom are all things;\nwho was before existence; the god who is all beings; who is the end of\nultimate objects; who is beyond final spirit, and is one with supreme soul;\nwho is contemplated as the cause of final liberation by\n\np. 73\n\nsages anxious to be free; in whom are not the qualities of goodness, foulness,\nor darkness, that belong to undeveloped nature. May that purest of all pure\nspirits this day be propitious to us. May that Hari be propitious to us, whose\ninherent might is not an object of the progressive chain of moments or of\ndays, that make up time. May he who is called the supreme god, who is not in\nneed of assistance, Hari, the soul of all embodied substance, be favourable\nunto us. May that Hari, who is both cause and effect; who is the cause of\ncause, the effect of effect; he who is the effect of successive effect; who is\nthe effect of the effect of the effect himself; the product of the effect of\nthe effect of the effect, or elemental substance; to him I bow 5. The cause of\nthe cause; the cause of the cause of the cause; the cause of them all; to him\nI bow. To him who is the enjoyer and thing to be enjoyed; the creator and\nthing to be created; who is the agent and the effect; to that supreme being I\nbow. The infinite nature of Vishn\xcc\x81u is pure, intelligent, perpetual, unborn,\nundecayable, inexhaustible, inscrutable, immutable; it is neither gross nor\nsubtile, nor capable of being defined: to that ever holy nature of Vishn\xcc\x81u I\nbow. To him whose faculty to create the universe abides in but a part of but\nthe ten-millionth part of him; to him who is one with the inexhaustible\nsupreme spirit, I bow: and to the glorious nature of the supreme Vishn\xcc\x81u,\nwhich nor gods, nor sages, nor I, nor \xc5\x9aankara apprehend; that nature which the\nYogis, after incessant effort, effacing both moral merit and demerit, behold\nto be contemplated in the mystical monosyllable Om: the supreme glory of\nVishn\xcc\x81u, who is the first of all; of whom, one only god, the triple energy is\nthe same with Brahma, Vishn\xcc\x81u, and \xc5\x9aiva: oh lord of all, great soul of all,\nasylum of all, undecayable, have pity upon thy servants; oh Vishn\xcc\x81u, be\nmanifest unto us."\n\np. 74\n\nPara\xc5\x9bara continued.--The gods, having heard this prayer uttered by Brahma,\nbowed down, and cried, "Be favourable to us; be present to our sight: we bow\ndown to that glorious nature which the mighty Brahma does not know; that which\nis thy nature, oh imperishable, in whom the universe abides." Then the gods\nhaving ended, Vrihaspati and the divine Rishis thus prayed: "We bow down to\nthe being entitled to adoration; who is the first object of sacrifice; who was\nbefore the first of things; the creator of the creator of the world; the\nundefinable: oh lord of all that has been or is to be; imperishable type of\nsacrifice; have pity upon thy worshippers; appear to them, prostrate before\nthee. Here is Brahma; here is Trilochana (the three-eyed \xc5\x9aiva), with the\nRudras; Pusha, (the sun), with the \xc3\x81dityas; and Fire, with all the mighty\nluminaries: here are the sons of Aswini (the two Aswini Kumaras), the Vasus\nand all the winds, the Sadhyas, the Vi\xc5\x9bwadevas, and Indra the king of the\ngods: all of whom bow lowly before thee: all the tribes of the immortals,\nvanquished by the demon host, have fled to thee for succour."\n\nThus prayed to, the supreme deity, the mighty holder of the conch and discus,\nshewed himself to them: and beholding the lord of gods, bearing a shell, a\ndiscus, and a mace, the assemblage of primeval form, and radiant with embodied\nlight, Pitamaha and the other deities, their eyes moistened with rapture,\nfirst paid him homage, and then thus addressed him: "Repeated salutation to\nthee, who art indefinable: thou art Brahma; thou art the wielder of the Pinaka\nbow (\xc5\x9aiva); thou art Indra; thou art fire, air, the god of waters, the sun,\nthe king of death (Yama), the Vasus, the Maruts (the winds), the Sadhyas, and\nVi\xc5\x9bwadevas. This assembly of divinities, that now has come before thee, thou\nart; for, the creator of the world, thou art every where. Thou art the\nsacrifice, the prayer of oblation, the mystic syllable Om, the sovereign of\nall creatures: thou art all that is to be known, or to be unknown: oh\nuniversal soul, the whole world consists of thee. We, discomfited by the\nDaityas, have fled to thee, oh Vishn\xcc\x81u, for refuge. Spirit of all, have\ncompassion upon us; defend us with thy mighty power. There will be affliction,\ndesire, trouble, and grief, until thy protection is obtained: but thou art the\nremover of all sins. Do thou then, oh pure of spirit, shew favour unto\n\np. 75\n\nus, who have fled to thee: oh lord of all, protect us with thy great power, in\nunion with the goddess who is thy strength 6." Hari, the creator of the\nuniverse, being thus prayed to by the prostrate divinities, smiled, and thus\nspake: "With renovated energy, oh gods, I will restore your strength. Do you\nact as I enjoin. Let all the gods, associated with the Asuras, cast all sorts\nof medicinal herbs into the sea of milk; and then taking the mountain Mandara\nfor the churning-stick, the serpent Vasuki for the rope, churn the ocean\ntogether for ambrosia; depending upon my aid. To secure the assistance of the\nDaityas, you must be at peace with them, and engage to give them an equal\nportion of the fruit of your associated toil; promising them, that by drinking\nthe Amrita that shall be produced from the agitated ocean, they shall become\nmighty and immortal. I will take care that the enemies of the gods shall not\npartake of the precious draught; that they shall share in the labour alone."\n\nBeing thus instructed by the god of gods, the divinities entered into alliance\nwith the demons, and they jointly undertook the acquirement of the beverage of\nimmortality. They collected various kinds of medicinal herbs, and cast them\ninto the sea of milk, the waters of which were radiant as the thin and shining\nclouds of autumn. They then took the mountain Mandara for the staff; the\nserpent Vasuki for the cord; and commenced to churn the ocean for the Amrita.\nThe assembled gods were stationed by Krishn\xcc\x81a at the tail of the serpent; the\nDaityas and Danavas at its head and neck. Scorched by the flames emitted from\nhis inflated hood, the demons were shorn of their glory; whilst the clouds\ndriven towards his tail by the breath of his mouth, refreshed the gods with\nrevivifying showers. In the midst of the milky sea, Hari himself, in the form\nof a tortoise, served as a pivot for the mountain, as it was whirled around.\nThe holder of the mace and discus was present in other forms amongst the gods\nand demons, and assisted to drag the monarch of the serpent race: and in\nanother vast body he sat upon the summit of the mountain. With one portion of\nhis energy, unseen by gods or demons, he sustained the serpent king; and with\nanother, infused vigour into the gods.\n\np. 76\n\nFrom the ocean, thus churned by the gods and Danavas, first uprose the cow\nSurabhi, the fountain of milk and curds, worshipped by the divinities, and\nbeheld by them and their associates with minds disturbed, and eyes glistening\nwith delight. Then, as the holy Siddhas in the sky wondered what this could\nbe, appeared the goddess Varuni (the deity of wine), her eyes rolling with\nintoxication. Next, from the whirlpool of the deep, sprang the celestial\nParijata tree, the delight of the nymphs of heaven, perfuming the world with\nits blossoms. The troop of \xc3\x81psarasas, the nymphs of heaven, were then\nproduced, of surprising loveliness, endowed with beauty and with taste. The\ncool-rayed moon next rose, and was seized by Mahadeva: and then poison was\nengendered from the sea, of which the snake gods (Nagas) took possession.\nDhanwantari, robed in white, and bearing in his hand the cup of Amrita, next\ncame forth: beholding which, the sons of Diti and of Danu, as well as the\nMunis, were filled with satisfaction and delight. Then, seated on a full-blown\nlotus, and holding a water-lily in her hand, the goddess \xc5\x9ari, radiant with\nbeauty, rose from the waves. The great sages, enraptured, hymned her with the\nsong dedicated to her praise 7. Vi\xc5\x9bwavasu and other heavenly quiristers sang,\nand Ghritachi and other celestial nymphs danced before her. Ganga and other\nholy streams attended for her ablutions; and the elephants of the skies,\ntaking up their pure waters in vases of gold, poured them over the goddess,\nthe queen of the universal world. The sea of milk in person presented her with\na wreath of never-fading flowers; and the artist of the gods (Viswakerma)\ndecorated her person with heavenly ornaments. Thus bathed, attired, and\nadorned, the goddess, in the view of the celestials, cast herself upon the\nbreast of Hari; and there reclining, turned her eyes upon the deities, who\nwere inspired with rapture by her gaze. Not so the Daityas, who, with\nViprachitti at their head, were filled with indignation, as Vishn\xcc\x81u turned\naway from them, and they were abandoned by the goddess of prosperity\n(Lakshmi.)\n\nThe powerful and indignant Daityas then forcibly seized the Amrita-cup, that\nwas in the hand of Dhanwantari: but Vishn\xcc\x81u, assuming a female form,\nfascinated and deluded them; and recovering the Amrita\n\np. 77\n\nfrom them, delivered it to the gods. \xc5\x9aakra and the other deities quaffed the\nambrosia. The incensed demons, grasping their weapons, fell upon them; but the\ngods, into whom the ambrosial draught had infused new vigour, defeated and put\ntheir host to flight, and they fled through the regions of space, and plunged\ninto the subterraneous realms of Patala. The gods thereat greatly rejoiced,\ndid homage to the holder of the discus and mace, and resumed their reign in\nheaven. The sun shone with renovated splendour, and again discharged his\nappointed task; and the celestial luminaries again circled, oh best of Munis,\nin their respective orbits. Fire once more blazed aloft, beautiful in\nsplendour; and the minds of all beings were animated by devotion. The three\nworlds again were rendered happy by prosperity; and Indra, the chief of the\ngods, was restored to power 8. Seated upon his throne, and once more in\n\np. 78\n\nheaven, exercising sovereignty over the gods, \xc5\x9aakra thus eulogized the goddess\nwho bears a lotus in her hand:--\n\n"I bow down to \xc5\x9ari, the mother of all beings, seated on her lotus throne, with\neyes like full-blown lotuses, reclining on the breast of Vishn\xcc\x81u. Thou art\nSiddhi (superhuman power): thou art Swadha and Swaha: thou art ambrosia\n(Sudha), the purifier of the universe: thou art evening, night, and dawn: thou\nart power, faith, intellect: thou art the goddess of letters (Saraswati).\nThou, beautiful goddess, art knowledge of devotion,\n\np. 79\n\ngreat knowledge, mystic knowledge, and spiritual knowledge 9; which confers\neternal liberation. Thou art the science of reasoning, the three Vedas, the\narts and sciences 10: thou art moral and political science. The world is\npeopled by thee with pleasing or displeasing forms. Who else than thou, oh\ngoddess, is seated on that person of the god of gods, the wielder of the mace,\nwhich is made up of sacrifice, and contemplated by holy ascetics? Abandoned by\nthee, the three worlds were on the brink of ruin; but they have been\nreanimated by thee. From thy propitious gaze, oh mighty goddess, men obtain\nwives, children, dwellings, friends, harvests, wealth. Health and strength,\npower, victory, happiness, are easy of attainment to those upon whom thou\nsmilest. Thou art the mother of all beings, as the god of gods, Hari, is their\nfather; and this world, whether animate or inanimate, is pervaded by thee and\nVishn\xcc\x81u. Oh thou who purifiest all things, forsake not our treasures, our\ngranaries, our dwellings, our dependants, our persons, our wives: abandon not\nour children, our friends, our lineage, our jewels, oh thou who abidest on the\nbosom of the god of gods. They whom thou desertest are forsaken by truth, by\npurity, and goodness, by every amiable and excellent quality; whilst the base\nand worthless upon whom thou lookest favourably become immediately endowed\nwith all excellent qualifications, with families, and with power. He on whom\nthy countenance is turned is honourable, amiable, prosperous, wise, and of\nexalted birth; a hero of irresistible prowess: but all his merits and his\nadvantages are converted into worthlessness from whom, beloved of Vishn\xcc\x81u,\nmother of the world, thou avertest thy face. The tongues of Brahma, are\nunequal to celebrate thy excellence. Be propitious to me, oh goddess, lotus-\neyed, and never forsake me more."\n\nBeing thus praised, the gratified \xc5\x9ari, abiding in all creatures, and\n\np. 80\n\nheard by all beings, replied to the god of a hundred rites (\xc5\x9aatakratu); "I am\npleased, monarch of the gods, by thine adoration. Demand from me what thou\ndesirest: I have come to fulfil thy wishes." "If, goddess," replied Indra,\n"thou wilt grant my prayers; if I am worthy of thy bounty; be this my first\nrequest, that the three worlds may never again be deprived of thy presence. My\nsecond supplication, daughter of ocean, is, that thou wilt not forsake him who\nshall celebrate thy praises in the words I have addressed to thee." "I will\nnot abandon," the goddess answered, "the three worlds again: this thy first\nboon is granted; for I am gratified by thy praises: and further, I will never\nturn my face away from that mortal who morning and evening shall repeat the\nhymn with which thou hast addressed me."\n\nPara\xc5\x9bara proceeded.--Thus, Maitreya, in former times the goddess \xc5\x9ari conferred\nthese boons upon the king of the gods, being pleased by his adorations; but\nher first birth was as the daughter of Bhrigu by Khyati: it was at a\nsubsequent period that she was produced from the sea, at the churning of the\nocean by the demons and the gods, to obtain ambrosia 11. For in like manner as\nthe lord of the world, the god of gods, Janarddana, descends amongst mankind\n(in various shapes), so does his coadjutrix \xc5\x9ari. Thus when Hari was born as a\ndwarf, the son of Aditi, Lakshmi appeared from a lotus (as Padma, or Kamala);\nwhen he was born as Rama, of the race of Bhrigu (or Para\xc5\x9burama), she was\nDharan\xcc\x81i; when he was Raghava (Ramachandra), she was Sita; and when he was\nKrishn\xcc\x81a, she became Rukmini. In the other descents of Vishn\xcc\x81u, she is his\nassociate. If he takes a celestial form, she appears as divine; if a mortal,\nshe becomes a mortal too, transforming her own person agreeably to whatever\ncharacter it pleases Vishn\xcc\x81u to put on. Whosoever hears this\n\np. 81\n\naccount of the birth of Lakshmi, whosoever reads it, shall never lose the\ngoddess Fortune from his dwelling for three generations; and misfortune, the\nfountain of strife, shall never enter into those houses in which the hymns to\n\xc5\x9ari are repeated.\n\nThus, Brahman, have I narrated to thee, in answer to thy question, how\nLakshmi, formerly the daughter of Bhrigu, sprang from the sea of milk; and\nmisfortune shall never visit those amongst mankind who daily recite the\npraises of Lakshmi uttered by Indra, which are the origin and cause of all\nprosperity.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[70:1](vp044.htm#fr_229) Durvasas was the son of Atri by Anasuya, and was an\nincarnation of a portion of \xc5\x9aiva.\n\n[70:2](vp044.htm#fr_230) Vidyadhari. These beings, male and female, are\nspirits of an inferior order, tenanting the middle regions of the atmosphere.\nAccording to the Vayu, the garland was given to the nymph by Devi.\n\n[70:3](vp044.htm#fr_231) He observed the Vrata, or vow of insanity; equivalent\nto the ecstasies of some religious fanatics. In this state,\' says the\ncommentator, \'even saints are devils.\'\n\n[72:4](vp044.htm#fr_232) They became Nih-satwa; and Satwa is explained\nthroughout by Dhairyya, \'steadiness,\' \'fortitude.\'\n\n[73:5](vp044.htm#fr_233) The first effect of primary cause is nature, or\nPrakriti: the effect of the effect, or of Prakriti, is Mahat: effect in the\nthird degree is Ahankara: in the fourth, or the effect of the effect\n(Ahankara) of the effect (Mahat) of the effect (Prakriti), is elementary\nsubstance, or Bhuta. Vishn\xcc\x81u is each and all. So in the succeeding ascending\nscale, Brahma is the cause of mortal life; the cause of Brahma is the egg, or\naggregate elementary matter: its cause is, therefore, elementary matter; the\ncause of which is subtile or rudimental matter, which originates from\nAhankara, and so on. Vishn\xcc\x81u is also each and all of these.\n\n[75:6](vp044.htm#fr_234) With thy \xc5\x9aakti, or the goddess \xc5\x9ari or Lakshmi.\n\n[76:7](vp044.htm#fr_235) Or with the Sukta, or hymn of the Vedas, commencing,\n"Hiranya vernam," &c.\n\n[77:8](vp044.htm#fr_236) The churning of the ocean does not occur in several\nof the Puran\xcc\x81as, and is but cursorily alluded to in the \xc5\x9aiva, Linga, and Kurma\nPuran\xcc\x81as. The Vayu and Padma have much the same narrative as that of our text;\nand so have the Agni and Bhagavata, except that they refer only briefly to the\nanger of Durvasas, without narrating the circumstances; indicating their being\nposterior, therefore, to the original tale. The part, however, assigned to\nDurvasas appears to be an embellishment added to the original, for no mention\nof him occurs in the Matsya P. nor even in the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba, neither does it\noccur in what may be considered the oldest extant versions of the story, those\nof the Ramayana and Mahabharata: both these ascribe the occurrence to the\ndesire of the gods and Daityas to become immortal. The Matsya assigns a\nsimilar motive to the gods, instigated by observing that the Daityas slain by\nthem in battle were restored to life by \xc5\x9aukra with the Sanjivini, or herb of\nimmortality, which he had discovered. The account in the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba is brief\nand obscure, and is explained by the commentator as an allegory, in which the\nchurning of the ocean typifies ascetic penance, and the ambrosia is final\nliberation: but this is mere mystification. The legend of the Ramayana is\ntranslated, vol. I. p. 410. of the Serampore edition; and that of the\nMahabharata by Sir C. Wilkins, in the notes to his translation of the\nBhagavata Gita. See also the original text, Cal. ed. p. 40. It has been\npresented to general readers in a more attractive form by my friend H. M.\nParker, in his Draught of Immortality, printed with other poems, Lond. 1827.\nThe Matsya P. has many of the stanzas of the Mahabharata interspersed with\nothers. There is some variety in the order and number of articles produced\nfrom the ocean. As I have observed elsewhere (Hindu Theatre, I. 59. Lond.\ned.), the popular enumeration is fourteen; but the Ramayana specifies but\nnine; the Mahabharata, nine; the Bhagavata, ten; the Padma, nine; the Vayu,\ntwelve; the p. 78 Matsya, perhaps, gives the whole number. Those in which most\nagree, are, 1. the Halahala or Kalakuta poison, swallowed by \xc5\x9aiva: 2. Varuni\nor Sura, the goddess of wine, who being taken by the gods, and rejected by the\nDaityas, the former were termed Suras, and the latter Asuras: 3. the horse\nUchchai\xc5\x9b\xc5\x9bravas, taken by Indra: 4. Kaustubha, the jewel worn by Vishn\xcc\x81u: 5.\nthe moon: 6. Dhanwantari, with the Amrita in his Kaman\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81alu, or vase; and\nthese two articles are in the Vayu considered as distinct products: 7. the\ngoddess Padma or \xc5\x9ari: 8. the Apsarasas, or nymphs of heaven: 9. Surabhi, or\nthe cow of plenty: 10. the Parijata tree, or tree of heaven: 11. Airavata, the\nelephant taken by Indra. The Matsya adds, 12. the umbrella taken by Varuna:\n13. the earrings taken by Indra, and given to Aditi: and apparently another\nhorse, the white horse of the sun: or the number may be completed by counting\nthe Amrita separately from Dhanwantari. The number is made up in the popular\nlists by adding the bow and the conch of Vishn\xcc\x81u; but there does not seem to\nbe any good authority for this, and the addition is a sectarial one: so is\nthat of the Tula\xc5\x9bi tree, a plant sacred to Krishn\xcc\x81a, which is one of the\ntwelve specified by the Vayu P. The Uttara Khanda of the Padma P. has a\npeculiar enumeration, or, Poison; Jyesht\xcc\x81ha or Alakshmi, the goddess of\nmisfortune, the elder born to fortune; the goddess of wine; Nidra, or sloth;\nthe Apsarasas; the elephant of Indra; Lakshmi; the moon; and the Tula\xc5\x9bi plant.\nThe reference to Mohini, the female form assumed by Vishn\xcc\x81u, is very brief in\nour text; and no notice is taken of the story told in the Mahabharata and some\nof the Puran\xcc\x81as, of the Daitya Rahu\'s insinuating himself amongst the gods,\nand obtaining a portion of the Amrita: being beheaded for this by Vishn\xcc\x81u, the\nhead became immortal, in consequence of the Amrita having reached the throat,\nand was transferred as a constellation to the skies; and as the sun and moon\ndetected his presence amongst the gods, Rahu pursues them with implacable\nhatred, and his efforts to seize them are the causes of eclipses; Rahu\ntypifying the ascending and descending nodes. This seems to be the simplest\nand oldest form of the legend. The equal immortality of the body, under the\nname Ketu, and his being the cause of meteorical phenomena, seems to have been\nan after-thought. In the Padma and Bhagavata, Rahu and Ketu are the sons of\nSinhika, the wife of the Danava Viprachitti.\n\n[79:9](vp044.htm#fr_237) The four Vidyas, or branches of knowledge, are said\nto be, Yajna vidya, knowledge or performance of religious rites; Maha vidya,\ngreat knowledge, the worship of the female principle, or Tantrika worship;\nGuhya vidya, knowledge of mantras, mystical prayers, and incantations; and\n\xc3\x81tma vidya, knowledge of soul, true wisdom.\n\n[79:10](vp044.htm#fr_238) Or Vartta, explained to mean the \xc5\x9ailpa \xc5\x9bastra,\nmechanics, sculpture, and architecture; \xc3\x81yur-veda, medicine, &c.\n\n[80:11](vp044.htm#fr_239) The cause of this, however, is left unexplained. The\nPadma P. inserts a legend to account for the temporary separation of Lakshmi\nfrom Vishn\xcc\x81u, which appears to be peculiar to that work. Bhrigu was lord of\nLakshmipur, a city on the Narmada, given him by Brahma. His daughter Lakshmi\ninstigated her husband to request its being conceded to her, which offending\nBhrigu, he cursed Vishn\xcc\x81u to be born upon earth ten times, to be separated\nfrom his wife, and to have no children. The legend is an insipid modern\nembellishment.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter X](vp045.htm)\n\n'
