And the goblin said to him: "O King, I will tell you\nanother little story to relieve your weariness. Listen."\n\n\n\nLong ago there was a city named Golden City on the bank of the Ganges, where a\nquarter of the old perfect virtue still lingers in these evil days. There was\na king named Glorious, and he deserved the name. His bravery kept the world\nfrom being overflowed, like the shore of the sea.\n\nIn this king\'s city lived a great merchant, who had a daughter named Passion.\nEveryone who saw her fell in love and went mad with passion.\n\nWhen she grew to be a young woman, the virtuous merchant went to King Glorious\nand said: "Your Majesty, I have a daughter, the gem of the three worlds, and\nshe is old enough to marry. I could not give her to anyone without consulting\nyour Majesty. For you are the master of all gems in the world. Pray marry her\nand thus lay me under obligations."\n\nSo the king sent his own Brahmans to examine her qualities. But when the\nBrahmans saw her supreme loveliness, they were troubled and thought: "If the\nking should marry her, his kingdom would be ruined. He would think only of\nher, and would doubtless neglect his kingdom. Therefore we must not report her\ngood qualities to the king."\n\nSo they returned to the king and said: "Your Majesty, she has bad qualities."\nSo the king did not marry the merchant\'s daughter. But he bade the merchant\ngive his daughter to a general named Force. And she lived happily with her\nhusband in his house.\n\nAfter a time the lion of spring came dancing through the forest and slew the\nelephant of winter. And King Glorious went forth on the back of an elephant to\nsee the spring festival. And the drum was beaten to warn virtuous women to\nstay within doors. Otherwise they would have fallen in love with his beauty,\nand love-sickness might be expected.\n\nBut when Passion heard the drum, she did not like to be left alone. She went\nout on the balcony, that the king might see her. She seemed like the flame of\nlove which the spring-time was fanning with southern breezes. And the king saw\nher, and his whole being was shaken. He felt her beauty sinking deep in his\nheart like a victorious arrow of Love, and he fainted.\n\nHis servants brought him back to consciousness, and he returned to the city.\nThere he made inquiries and learned that this was Passion whom he had rejected\nbefore. So he banished from the country the Brahmans who had said that she had\nbad qualities, and he thought longingly of her every day.\n\nAnd as he thought of her, he burned over the flame of love, and wasted away\nday and night. And though from shame he tried to conceal it, he finally told\nthe reason of his anguish to responsible people who asked him.\n\nThey said: "Do not suffer. Why do you not seize her?" But the virtuous king\nwould not do it.\n\nThen General Force heard the story. He came and bowed at the feet of the king\nand said: "Your Majesty, she is the wife of your slave, therefore she is your\nslave. I give her to you of my own accord. Pray take my wife. Or better yet, I\nwill leave her here in the palace. Then you cannot be blamed if you marry\nher." And the general begged and insisted.\n\nBut the king became angry and said: "I am a king. How can I do such a wicked\nthing? If I should transgress, who would be virtuous? You are devoted to me.\nWhy do you urge me to a sin which is pleasant for the moment, but causes great\nsorrow in the next world? If you abandon your wedded wife, I shall not pardon\nyou. How could a man in my position overlook such a transgression? It is\nbetter to die." Thus the king argued against it. For the truly great throw\naway life rather than virtue. And when all the citizens came together and\nurged him, he was steadfast and refused.\n\nSo he slowly shrivelled away over the fever-flame of love and died. There was\nnothing left of King Glorious except his glory. And the general could not\nendure the death of his king. He burned himself alive. The actions of devoted\nmen are blameless.\n\n\n\nWhen the goblin on the king\'s shoulder had told this story, he asked the king:\n"O King, which of these two, the king and the general, was the more deserving?\nRemember the curse before you answer."\n\nThe king said: "I think the king was the more deserving."\n\nAnd the goblin said reproachfully: "O King, why was not the general better? He\noffered the king a wife like that, whose charms he knew from a long married\nlife. And when his king died, he burned himself like a faithful man. But the\nking gave her up without really knowing her attractions."\n\nThen the king laughed and said: "True enough, but not surprising. The general\nwas a gentleman born, and acted as he did from devotion to his superior. For\nservants must protect their masters even at the cost of their own lives. But\nkings are like mad elephants who cannot be goaded into obedience, who break\nthe binding-chain of virtue. They are insolent, and their judgment trickles\nfrom them with the holy water of consecration. Their eyes are blinded by the\nhurricane of power, and they do not see the road. From the most ancient times,\neven the kings who conquered the world have been maddened by love and have\nfallen into misfortune. But this king, though he ruled the whole world, though\nhe was maddened by the girl Passion, preferred to die rather than set his foot\non the path of iniquity. He was a hero. He was the better of the two."\n\nThen the goblin escaped by magic from the king\'s shoulder and went back. And\nthe king pursued him, undiscouraged. No great man stops in the middle of the\nhardest undertaking.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Seventeenth Goblin: The Youth who went through the Proper Ceremonies.\nWhy did he fail to win the magic spell?](ttg18.htm)\n\n'
