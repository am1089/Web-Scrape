Sthavira _S_ akalya said that breath is the beam 2, and as the other beams\nrest on the house-beam, thus the eye, the ear, the mind, the speech, the\nsenses, the body, the whole self rests on this 3 breath.\n\n2\\. Of that self the breathing is like the sibilants, the bones like the\nmutes, the marrow like the vowels, and the fourth part, flesh, blood, and the\nrest, like the semivowels 4,--so said Hrasva Ma _n_ _d_ ukeya.\n\n3\\. To us it was said to be a triad only 5.\n\n4\\. Of that triad, viz. bones, marrow, and joints, there are 360 (parts) on\nthis side (the right), and 360 on that side (the left). They make 720\ntogether, and 720 6 are the days and nights of the year. Thus that self which\nconsists of sight, hearing, metre, mind, and speech is like unto the days.\n\n5\\. He who thus knows this self, which consists of sight, hearing, metre,\nmind, and speech, as like unto the days, obtains union, likeness, or nearness\nwith the days, has sons and cattle, and lives his full age.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[257:1](sbe01233.htm#fr_654) In the first adhyaya meditations suggested by sa\n_m_ hita, pada, and krama have been discussed. Now follow meditations\nsuggested by certain classes of letters.\n\n[257:2](sbe01233.htm#fr_655) Ait. \xc3\x82r. III, 1, 4.\n\n[257:3](sbe01233.htm#fr_656) The Kashmir MS. reads etasmin pra _n_ e. The self\nhere is meant for the body, and yet it seems to be different from _s_ arira.\n\n[257:4](sbe01233.htm#fr_657) The Kashmir MS. writes antastha without visarga,\nwhile it is otherwise most careful in writing all sibilants.\n\n[257:5](sbe01233.htm#fr_658) _S_ akalya, as we saw, told his disciples that\nthere were three classes only, not four. Comm. The Kashmir MS. reads traya _m_\ntv eva na ityetat proktam.\n\n[257:6](sbe01233.htm#fr_659) The Kashmir MS, reads sapta vi _m_ _s_ ati _s_\n_k_ a _s_ atani.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2, 2](sbe01234.htm)\n\n'
