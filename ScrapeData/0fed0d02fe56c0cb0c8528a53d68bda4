A Brahman--either the Adhvaryu, or he who is his (the\nking's) court chaplain--sprinkles him in front, from behind;--\n\n5:4:2:22\\. With (Va _g_. S. X, 17), 'With Soma's glory I sprinkle\nthee,'--'with vigour' he thereby says; 'With Agni's glow . . . 1,'--'with\nvigour' he thereby says;--'With Surya's splendour . . .,'--'with vigour' he\nthereby says;--'With Indra's energy. . .,'--'with vigour' he thereby\nsays;--'Be thou the chieftain of chiefs!'--'be thou the supreme king of kings'\nhe thereby says;--'Guard (him) 2 against darts!'--darts meaning arrows, it is\npast murder by arrows that he thus guides him: therefore he says, 'guard him\nagainst darts!'\n\n5:4:2:33\\. [Va _g_. S. X, 18] 'Quicken him, O gods, to\n\np. 95\n\nbe unrivalled!'--he thereby says, 'Quicken him, O gods, so as to be without an\nenemy;'--'For great chiefdom, for great lordship!'--in this there is nothing\nobscure;--'For man-rule!'--'for the ruling of men' he thereby says;--'For\nIndra's lordly sway!'--'for power' he means to say, when he says, 'for Indra's\nlordly sway!'--'Him, the son of such and such (a man), the son of such and\nsuch (a woman),'--whatever be his parentage regarding that he says this;--'of\nsuch and such a people'--that is to say, of the people whose king he\nis;--'This man, O ye (people), is your king, Soma is the king of us Brahmans!'\n--he thereby causes everything here to be food for him (the king); the Brahman\nalone he excepts: therefore the Brahman is not to be fed upon, for he has Soma\nfor his king 1.\n\n5:4:2:44\\. He (the king) then rubs the sprinkled water\n\np. 96\n\nover himself with the horn of a black antelope; for that collected essence of\nthe waters wherewith he now anoints him means vigour: 'May this vigour of mine\nspread through my whole self,' thus he thinks, and therefore he rubs it all\nover himself.\n\n5:4:2:55\\. He rubs it over himself, with (Va _g_. S. X, 19), Forth from the\nback of the mountain, of the bull,'--even as the mountain stands out here,\neven as the bull stands out beyond the cattle, so does he who performs the Ra\n_g_ asuya stand out beyond everything here, and everything here is below him:\ntherefore he says, 'Forth from the back of the mountain, of the bull,'--'The\nships keep moving, the self-pouring; they, the upwards bent, have turned back\ndownwards, flowing after the dragon of the deep 1.'\n\n5:4:2:66\\. He then makes him step the (three) Vish _n_ u-steps within (the\nextent of) the tiger's skin, with, 'Vish _n_ u's outstepping thou art! Vish\n_n_ u's outstep thou art! Vish _n_ u's step thou art!' Now Vish _n_ u's\noutstepping (vikrama _n_ a), Vish _n_ u's outstep (vikranta), and Vish _n_ u's\nstep (kranta) 2 are these (three) worlds: thus having ascended these worlds,\nhe is high above everything here, and everything here is below him.\n\n5:4:2:77\\. He then pours the remainders (of the water) together into the\nBrahman's vessel: he thereby makes the Brahman an object of respect after the\nking, whence the Brahman is an object of respect after the king.\n\np. 97\n\n5:4:2:88\\. And to him who is his (the king's) dearest son, he hands that\nvessel, thinking, 'May this son of mine perpetuate this vigour of mine!'\n\n5:4:2:99\\. He then returns to the Garhapatya fire, (his son) holding on to him\nbehind, and offers, with (Va _g_. S. X, 20), 'O Pra _g_ apati, than thee none\nother hath encompassed all these forms: for whatsoever object we sacrifice,\nlet that accrue unto us!--This one is the father of N.N.!'--him who is the\nson, he makes the father, and him who is the father, he makes the son 1: he\nthereby links together the vigour of both of them.--'N.N. is the father of\nthis one!' him who is the father, he makes the father, and him who is the son,\nhe makes the son: after linking together the vigour of these two, he puts it\nagain in the proper way,--'May we be the lords of riches, hail!'--this is the\nblessing of that ceremony a blessing he thereby invokes.\n\n5:4:2:1010\\. And any residue that is left over, he offers in the \xc3\x82gnidhriya;\nfor redundant is that residue, and redundant also is the \xc3\x82gnidhriya,--in the\nGarhapatya they cook the oblations, and in the \xc3\x82havaniya they offer, but that\none is redundant: thus he puts the redundant to the redundant. He offers it on\nthe north part (of the hearth), for that is the region of that god (Rudra):\nhence he offers it on the north\n\np. 98\n\npart. He offers with, 'O Rudra, whatever potent [1](sbe4120.htm#fn_193),\nhighest name is thine, therein thou art an offering, thou art a home-offering,\nhail!'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[94:1](sbe4119.htm#fr_187) While the preceding formula is used by the priest,\nthe present and two succeeding ones (each with the words '. . . I sprinkle\nthee; guard him against darts!') are pronounced by the other three persons\nspecified in [V, 3, 5, 12](sbe4117.htm#5:3:5:12)-[14](sbe4117.htm#5:3:5:14),\neach sprinkling the king with the water in his respective vessel.\n\n[94:2](sbe4119.htm#fr_188) Mahidhara explains: 'O Soma, protect him, the\nSacrificer, in overcoming the enemy's missiles.'\n\n[95:1](sbe4119.htm#fr_189) Either at this juncture, or after the game at dice,\nthe Hot _ri_ recites the legend of _S_ una _h_ _s_ epha, as given Ait. Br.\nVII, 13-18.--'King Hari _s_ _k_ andra, of the race of Ikshvaku, being\nchildless, made a vow that if he obtained a son he would sacrifice him to Varu\n_n_ a. A son was born, who received the name of Rohita, but the father\npostponed, under various pretexts, the fulfilment of his vow. When at length\nhe resolved to perform the sacrifice, Rohita refused to be the victim, and\nwent out into the forest, where he lived for six years. He then met a poor\nBrahman _Ri_ shi called A _g_ igarta, who had three sons, and Rohita purchased\nfrom A _g_ igarta, for a hundred cows, the second son, named _S_ una _h_ _s_\nepha, to be the substitute for himself in the sacrifice. Varu _n_ a approved\nof the substitute, and the sacrifice was about to be performed, the father\nreceiving another hundred cows for binding his son to the sacrificial post,\nand a third hundred for agreeing to slaughter him. Suna _h_ _s_ epha, however,\nsaved himself by reciting verses in honour of different deities, and was\nreceived into the family of Vi _s_ vamitra, who was one of the officiating\npriests.'

According to the ceremonial of the Black Ya _g_ us the offering of the\nresidue takes place at the house (first of the favourite son, according to\n\xc3\x82pastamba, and then) of the queen. Taitt.
