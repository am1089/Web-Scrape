Now wherever he intends to perform a sacrifice, let him besmear (with\ncowdung) a surface of the dimension at least of an arrow on each side; let him\ndraw six lines thereon, one turned to the north, to the west (of the spot on\nwhich the fire is to be placed); two (lines) turned to the east, at the two\ndifferent ends (of the line mentioned first); three (lines) in the middle (of\nthose two); let him sprinkle that (place with water), establish the (sacred)\nfire (thereon), put (two or three pieces of fuel) on it, wipe (the ground)\nround (the fire), strew (grass) round (it), to the east, to the south, to the\nwest, to the north, ending (each time) in the north. Then (follows) silently\nthe sprinkling (of water) round (the fire).\n\n2\\. With two (Ku _s_ a blades used as) strainers the purifying of the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya\n(is done).\n\n3 3. Having taken two Ku _s_ a blades with unbroken tops, which do not bear a\nyoung shoot in them, of the measure of a span, at their two ends with his\n\np. 163\n\nthumbs and fourth fingers, with his hands turned with the inside upwards, he\npurifies (the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya, from the west) to the east, with (the words), 'By the\nimpulse of Savit _ri_ I purify thee with this uninjured purifier, with the\nrays of the good sun'\xc2\x97once with this formula, twice silently.\n\n4 4. The strewing (of grass) round (the fire) may be done or not done in the \xc3\x82\n_g_ ya offerings.\n\n5 5. So also the two \xc3\x82 _g_ ya portions (may optionally be sacrificed) in the\nPakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as.\n\n6 6. And the (assistance of a) Brahman (is optional), except at the sacrifice\nto Dhanvantari and at the sacrifice of the spit-ox (offered to Rudra).\n\n7 7. Let him sacrifice with (the words), 'To such and such a deity svaha!'\n\n8\\. If there is no rule (as to the deities to whom the sacrifice belongs, they\nare) Agni, Indra, Pra _g_ apati, the Vi _s_ ve devas, Brahman.\n\n9 9. (Different Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as, when) offered at the same time, should have\nthe same Barhis (sacrificial grass), the same fuel, the same \xc3\x82 _g_ ya, and the\nsame (oblation to Agni) Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t.\n\n10\\. With reference thereto the following sacrificial stanza is sung:\n\n'He who has to perform (different) Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as, should offer them with\nthe same \xc3\x82 _g_ ya, the same\n\np. 164\n\n[paragraph continues] Barhis, and the same Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t, even if the\ndeity (of those sacrifices) is not the same.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[162:1](sbe29102.htm#fr_367) 3, 1.
