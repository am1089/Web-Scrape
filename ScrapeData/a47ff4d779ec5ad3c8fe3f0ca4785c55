Lending Money at Interest.\n\n* 98. 98 A contract of delivery and receipt may be made with a view to the profit arising from Sthana. It is called Kusida (lending money at interest), and money-lenders make a living by it.\n\np. 66\n\n* 99. 99 Let a money-lender take, in addition to the principal, the interest fixed by Vasish _th_ a, viz. an eightieth part of a hundred in every month.\n\n* 100. 100 Two, three, four, or five (in the hundred) is the legitimate (rate of interest). Let him take as much in the shape of interest, every month, in the direct order of the (four) castes.\n\n* 101. 101 Or let him take two in the hundred, remembering the practice of the virtuous. By taking two in the hundred, he does not commit the crime of covetousness.\n\n* 102. 102 Interest is declared fourfold in this law-book: periodical interest; stipulated interest; kayika interest; and compound interest.\n\n* 103. 103 That which runs by the month is termed\n\np. 67\n\nperiodical interest. That interest is termed stipulated interest which has\nbeen promised by the debtor himself.\n\n* 104. Interest at the rate of one Pa _n_ a or quarter of a Pa _n_ a, paid regularly without diminishing the principal, is denoted kayika interest. Interest upon interest is called compound interest.\n\n* 105. 105 This is the general rule for interest to be paid on loans. There are special rules according to the local usages of the country where the loan has been made.\n\n* 106. 106 In some countries the loan may grow till twice the amount of the principal has been reached. In other countries it may grow till it becomes three, or four, or eight times as large as the principal.\n\n107. 107 The interest on gold, grain, and clothes may rise till it amounts to two, three, or four times the principal. On liquids, the interest may become octuple; of women and cattle, their offspring (is considered as the interest).\n\np. 68\n\n* 108. [108](sbe3314.htm#fn_203) No interest must ever be raised on loans made from friendship, unless there be an agreement to the purpose. Without an agreement even, interest accrues on such loans after the lapse of half a year.\n\n* 109. [109](sbe3314.htm#fn_204) A loan made from friendship can never yield any interest, without being reclaimed by the creditor. If the debtor refuses to restore it on demand, it shall yield interest at the rate of five per cent.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[65:98](sbe3313.htm#fr_194) According to A., Sthana, 'continued abode,' may be\nthreefold: relating to the matter, as when profit arises from (the continuance\nof) victuals remaining well kept in a certain place; or relating to one's own\nabode, as when a dealer derives profit from business transactions in his own\ncountry; or relating to a different place, as when a dealer earns money\nthrough foreign trade.\n\n[66:99](sbe3313.htm#fr_195) Identical with Manu VIII, 140. This rule, which\nfixes the rate of interest at 1\xc2\xbc per cent. by the month, or 15 per cent. per\nannum, is actually found in the Dharmasutra of Vasish _th_ a II, 51.\n\n[66:100](sbe3313.htm#fr_196) Identical with Manu VIII, 142. The meaning is\nthat he shall take 2 per cent. from a Brahman, 3 per cent. from a Kshatriya, 4\nper cent. from a Vai _s_ ya, and 5 per cent. from a _S_ udra. A. It appears,\nfrom the commentaries on the code of Manu, that the present rule is applicable\nin those cases where no security has been given, whereas the preceding\nparagraph refers to loans secured by a pledge.\n\n[66:101](sbe3313.htm#fr_197) Identical with Manu VIII, 141. The meaning is\nthat he shall take 2 per cent. only from honest men, to whatever caste they\nmay belong. A. In the code of Manu, the present rule precedes par. 100,\ninstead of following it. The author of the Narada-sm _ri_ ti would seem to\nhave erroneously inverted the original position of the two verses.\n\n[66:102](sbe3313.htm#fr_198) Manu VIII, 153; Gautama XII, 34, 35. See, too,\nColebrooke's Digest I, XXXV-XLV.\n\n[66:103](sbe3313.htm#fr_199) 103, 104. 'Periodical interest' means monthly\ninterest, at the rate of from 2 to 5 per cent., according to the caste of the\ndebtor. 'Stipulated interest' is interest at the rate of more than 10 per\ncent., which has been promised by the debtor himself in times of great\ndistress. Kaya means principal. If a Pa _n_ a, or quarter of a Pa _n_ a, has\nto be p. 67 paid every day, without diminishing the principal, i.e. if the\nwhole principal has to be restored, though ever so much interest may have been\npaid on it, it is called kayika interest. Where interest at the rate of 5 per\ncent. per mensem has been paid for twenty months, it will reach the same\namount as the sum originally due, so that the principal is doubled. After\ntwenty months more it becomes quadruple; twenty months later it becomes\noctuple, and so on. This is called compound interest. A. B _ri_ haspati and\nVyasa derive the term kayika from kaya 'a body,' and explain that it denotes\nbodily labour, or the use of a pledged slave.\n\n[67:105](sbe3313.htm#fr_200) Where local customs obtain, differing from the\nrules previously given, they have to be followed. A.\n\n[67:106](sbe3313.htm#fr_201) 106, 107. Manu VIII, 151; Vish _n_ u VI, 11-17;\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 39; Gautama XII, 36.\n\n[67:107](sbe3313.htm#fr_202) Gold borrowed at whatsoever rate of interest\nshall grow till it becomes double; grain, till it becomes treble; cloth, till\nit becomes p. 68 quadruple; liquids (and condiments), till they become\noctuple. The offspring of pledged females and cattle shall belong to the\ncreditor. A.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 7. Usurers](sbe3314.htm)\n\n"
