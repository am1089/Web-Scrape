He prepares a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Vish _n_ u, a\npap for Indra and Vish _n_ u, and either a cake on three potsherds, or a pap,\nfor Vish _n_ u. He performs that Trisha _m_ yukta 1 offering. Therewith the\ngods came by men, and in like manner does this (king) now thereby come by men.\n\n5:2:5:22\\. Now as to why there is that cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and\nVish _n_ u;--Agni is the giver, and men are Vish _n_ u's: thus Agni, the\ngiver, gives him (the king) men.\n\n5:2:5:33\\. And as to why there is a pap for Indra and Vish _n_ u;--Indra is\nthe Sacrificer, and men are Vish _n_ u's: thus Agni, the giver, gives him (the\n\np. 55\n\n[paragraph continues] Sacrificer) men; he now puts himself in contact with\nthem, makes them his own.\n\n5:2:5:44\\. And as to why there is either a cake on three potsherds, or a pap,\nfor Vish _n_ u;--whatever men Agni, the giver, gives him, among them he\nthereby finally establishes him (the king); and whatever work he wishes to do\nwith his men, that he is able to do. Thus he thereby approaches the men,\nthinking, 'May I be consecrated, and possessed of men!' A dwarfish bull is the\nsacrificial fee for this (offering), for the dwarf belongs to Vish _n_ u 1.\n\n5:2:5:55\\. He then performs another Trisha _m_ yukta offering. He prepares a\ncake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Pushan, a pap for Indra and Pushan, and\na pap for Pushan: this Trisha _m_ yukta he offers. Thereby the gods obtained\ncattle; and in like manner does this (king) thereby obtain cattle.\n\n5:2:5:66\\. Now as to why there is that cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and\nPushan; Agni is the giver, and the cattle are Pushan's: thus Agni, the giver,\ngives him cattle.\n\n5:2:5:77\\. And as to why there is a pap for Indra and Pushan;--Indra is the\nSacrificer, and the cattle are Pushan's: whatever cattle Agni, the giver,\ngives him, therewith he now puts himself in contact, those he makes his own.\n\n5:2:5:88\\. And why there is a pap for Pushan;--whatever cattle Agni, the\ngiver, gives him, therewith he thereby finally establishes him, and whatever\nwork he wishes to do with his cattle, that he is able\n\np. 56\n\nto do: thus he comes by cattle, thinking, 'May I be consecrated, possessed of\ncattle!' A dark-grey 1 bull is the fee for this (offering), for such a dark-\ngrey one is of Pushan's nature: there are two forms of the dark-grey, the\nwhite hair and the black; and 'two and two' means a productive pair, and\nPushan represents productiveness, for Pushan is cattle, and cattle means\nproductiveness: thus a productive pair is obtained,--hence a dark-grey bull is\nthe sacrificial fee.\n\n5:2:5:99\\. He then performs another Trisha _m_ yukta offering. He prepares a\ncake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Soma, a pap for Indra and Soma, and a\npap for Soma: this Trisha _m_ yukta (triply connected) he offers:--Thereby the\ngods attained glory; and in like manner does this (king) thereby attain glory.\n\n5:2:5:1010\\. Now as to why there is that cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and\nSoma;--Agni is the giver, and Soma is glory: thus Agni, the giver, gives him\nglory.\n\n5:2:5:1111\\. And as to why there is a pap for Indra and Soma;--Indra is the\nSacrificer, and Soma is glory: whatever glory Agni, the giver, gives him,\ntherewith he now puts himself in contact, that he makes his own.\n\n5:2:5:1212\\. And why there is a pap for Soma;--whatever glory, Agni, the\ngiver, gives him, therein he now finally establishes him; and whatever work\nhe, the glorious, wishes to do, that he is able to do. Thus he thereby attains\nglory,--thinking, 'May I be consecrated, endowed with glory!' for the\ninglorious one has no concern with success. A brown bull is\n\np. 57\n\nthe fee for this (offering); for such a brown one is of Soma's nature.\n\n5:2:5:1313\\. And on the following day he prepares a cake-on twelve potsherds\nfor (Agni) Vai _s_ vanara, and a barley pap for Varu _n_ a. These two\nofferings he performs either on days following one another, or so as to use\nthe same barhis 1.\n\n5:2:5:1414\\. And as to why there is that (cake) for Vai _s_ vanara;--Vai _s_\nvanara ('belonging to all men') truly is the year, and Pra _g_ apati is the\nyear; and Pra _g_ apati indeed thereby created abundance and creatures,\nthinking, 'May I be consecrated, having created abundance and creatures!' And\nin like manner does that (king) thereby create abundance and creatures,\nthinking, 'May I be consecrated, having created abundance and creatures!'\n\n5:2:5:1515\\. And why it is one on twelve potsherds;--twelve months there are\nin the year, and Vai _s_ vanara is the year: this is why it is one on twelve\npotsherds.\n\n5:2:5:1616\\. And as to why there is a barley pap for Varu _n_ a; he thereby\nfrees the creatures from every snare of Varu _n_ a, from all that comes from\nVaru _n_ a 2;\n\np. 58\n\nand those creatures of his are produced sound and faultless: 'May I be\nconsecrated for sound and faultless creatures (or subjects)!' he thinks.\n\n5:2:5:1717\\. A bull is the fee for the Vai _s_ vanara (oblation); for Vai _s_\nvanara is the year, and Pra _g_ apati is the year; and the bull is the Pra _g_\napati (lord of creatures or generation) among cows: therefore a bull is the\nfee for the Vai _s_ vanara. A black cloth for the Varu _n_ a (oblation), for\nwhat is black belongs to Varu _n_ a. If he cannot obtain a black one, any kind\nof cloth will do: it is by its knots that the cloth belongs to Vanilla, for\nthe knot is sacred to Varu _n_ a.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[54:1](sbe4112.htm#fr_121) That is, 'the triply connected,' the ceremony being\nmade up of three rounds, each of which consists of three separate oblations,\n\n1\\. Agnavaish _n_ ava cake, Aindravaish _n_ ava pap, Vaish _n_ ava pap;  \n2\\. Agnapaush _n_ a cake, Aindrapaush _n_ a pap, Paush _n_ a pap;  \n3\\. Agnishomiya cake, Aindrasaumya pap, Samnya pap.\n\n[paragraph continues] In this way one of the three divinities for whom the\noffering is intended,--viz. Vish _n_ u, Pushan, and Soma,--is each time\nconnected with the two head-gods, Agni and Indra.--In the Black Ya _g_ ur-\nveda, this set of offerings (not, however, called there by this name), is\npreceded by another ceremony consisting of five oblations to Dhat _ri_ ,\nAnumati, Raka, Sinivali, and Kuhu. Taitt. S. I, 8, 8. Cf. _S_ at. Br. IX, 5,\n1, 38.\n\n[55:1](sbe4112.htm#fr_122) See the legend, I, 2, 3, 1 seq., which represents\nVish _n_ u as a dwarf, who obtained from the Asuras as much ground for the\ngods, as he lay upon.--'Tad dhi pa _s_ ushu vaish _n_ ava _m_ rupa _m_ yad\nvamanasya go _h_.' Ka _n_ va rec.\n\n[56:1](sbe4112.htm#fr_123) See V, 1, 3, 9.\n\n[57:1](sbe4112.htm#fr_124) That is to say, he is either to perform the Vai _s_\nvanara on one, and the Varu _n_ a one on the next--in which case a different\nbarhis, or altar-covering of sacrificial grass, would be needed--or he may\nperform them both on one and the same day, with the same barhis serving for\nboth.\n\n[57:2](sbe4112.htm#fr_125) See III, 8; 5, 10 where I translated, 'from all\n(guilt) against Varu _n_ a;' varu _n_ ya, doubtless, implies both the guilt\nincurred by the infringement of Varu _n_ a's sacred laws, and the punishment\ninflicted by him. As regards the 'swearing by Varu _n_ a (?)' there referred\nto, see _Ri_ k S. X, 97, 16 where the conjurer mutters: 'May they (the plants)\nfree me from the (evil) resulting from the curse and from Varu _n_ a;'--mu _\xc3\xb1_\nkantu ma _s_ apathyad atho varu _n_ yad uta.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 3, 1.
