Draupadi mourns the death of her brother and her five sons, and I rear\nshe will perish with grief."\n\nDraupadi came before her husbands and, weeping bitterly, said: "For thirteen\ncruel years you have endured shame and exile so that your children might\nprosper. But now that they are all slain, can you desire to have power and\nkingdom?"\n\nSaid Krishna: "O daughter of a rajah, is thy grief so great as is Pritha\'s and\nGandhari\'s, and as great as those who lament the loss or their husbands on the\nbattlefield? Thou hast less cause than others to wail now."\n\nDraupadi was soothed somewhat, but she turned to\n\np. 311\n\n[paragraph continues] Bhima and said: "If thou wilt not bring to me the head\nof Aswatthaman, I will never again look upon thy face."\n\nSaid Yudhishthira: "Aswatthaman is a Brahman, and Vishnu, the greatest of the\ngods, will punish him if he hath done wrong. If we should slay him now, O\nDraupadi, thy sons and thy brother and thy sire would not be restored unto\nthee."\n\nDraupadi said: "So be it. But Aswatthaman hath a great jewel which gleams in\ndarkness. Let it be taken from him, for it is as dear unto him as his life."\n\nThen Arjuna went in pursuit of Aswatthaman and found him, and returned with\nthe jewel.\n\nTo the battlefield came blind old Dhritarashtra, mourning the death of his\nhundred sons. And with the weeping maharajah were Queen Gandhari and the wives\nof the Kaurava princes, who sorrowed aloud. Wives wept for their husbands,\ntheir children wailed beside them, and mothers moaned for their sons. Bitter\nwas the anguish of tender-hearted women, and the air was filled with wailing\non that blood-red plain of Kurukshetra.\n\nWhen Queen Gandhari beheld the Pandavas she cried out: "The smell of\nDuryodhana is upon you all."\n\nNow Dhritarashtra plotted in his weak mind to crush the head of Bhima, the\nslayer of Duryodhana. When he embraced Yudhishthira he said: "Where is Bhima?"\nand they placed before him an image of the strong Pandava. Dhritarashtra put\nforth his arms, and he crushed the image in his embrace and fell back\nfainting. Then he wailed: "Alas! Bhima was as a son unto me. Although I have\nslain him, the dead cannot return." Well pleased was the maharajah when it was\ntold to him that Bhima still lived; and he embraced his son\'s\n\np. 312\n\nslayer tenderly and with forgiveness, saying: "I have no children now save the\nsons of Pandu, my brother."\n\nPritha rejoiced to meet her five sons, and she embraced them one by one. Then\nshe went towards the sorrowing Draupadi, who fainted in her arms. Thereafter\nthey wept together for the dead.\n\nThe bodies of the slain rajahs and princes were collected together, and\nwrapped in perfumed linen and laid each upon a funeral pyre and burned, and\nthe first pyre which was kindled was that of Duryodhana. The Pandavas mourned\nfor their kinsmen. Then they bathed in the holy Ganges, and took up water and\nsprinkled it in the name of each dead hero. Yudhishthira poured out the\noblation for Karna, his brother, and he gave great gifts to his widows and his\nchildren. Thereafter all the remaining bodies of the slain were burned on the\nbattlefield. 1\n\nYudhishthira was proclaimed rajah in the city of Hastinapur, and he wore the\ngreat jewel in his crown. A great sacrifice was offered up, and Dhaumya, the\nfamily priest of the Pandavas, poured the Homa offering to the gods on the\nsacred fire. Yudhishthira and Draupadi were anointed with holy water.\n\nIn the days that followed, Yudhishthira lamented over the carnage of the great\nwar, nor could he be comforted. At length Vyasa, the sage, appeared before him\nand advised that he should perform the horse sacrifice to atone for his sins.\n\nThen search was made for a moon-white horse with yellow tail and one black\near, and when it was found a plate of gold, inscribed with the name of\nYudhishthira, was tied upon its forehead. Thereafter the horse was\n\np. 313\n\nlet loose, and was allowed to wander wheresoever it desired. A great army,\nwhich was led by Arjuna, followed the horse.\n\nNow it was the custom in those days that when the sacred horse entered a raj\n1, that raj was proclaimed to be subject to the king who performed the\nceremony. And if any ruler detained the horse, he was compelled to fight with\nthe army which followed the wandering animal. Should he be overcome in battle,\nthe opposing rajah immediately joined forces with those of the conqueror, and\nfollowed the horse from kingdom to kingdom. For a whole year the animal was\nallowed to wander thus.\n\nThe horse was let loose on the night of full moon in the month of Choitro. 2\n\nArjuna met with many adventures. He fought against a rajah and the son of a\nrajah, who had a thousand wives in the country of Malwa, and defeated them.\nBut Agni, who had married a daughter of the rajah, came to rescue his kin. He\nfought against Arjuna with fire, but Arjuna shot celestial arrows which\nproduced water. Then the god made peace, and the rajah who had detained the\nhorse went away with Arjuna. Thereafter the horse came to a rock which was the\ngirl-wife of a Rishi who had been thus transformed because of her wickedness.\n"So will you remain," her husband had said, "until Yudhishthira performs the\nAswa-medha ceremony." The horse was unable to leave the rock. Then Arjuna\ntouched the rock, which immediately became a woman, and the horse was set\nfree.\n\nIn time the horse entered the land of Amazons, and the queen detained it, and\ncame forth with her women warriors to fight against Arjuna, who, however, made\npeace with them and went upon his way. Thereafter\n\np. 314\n\nthe holy steed reached a strange country where men and women and horses and\ncows and goats grew upon mighty trees like to fruit, and came to maturity and\ndied each day. The rajah came against Arjuna, but was defeated. Then all the\narmy fled to the islands of the sea, for they were Daityas, and Arjuna\nplundered their dwellings and obtained much treasure.\n\nOnce the horse entered a pond, and was cursed by the goddess Parvati, and it\nbecame a mare; it entered another pond and became a lion, owing to a Brahman\'s\nspell.\n\nIn the kingdom of Manipura the horse was seized, and soldiers armed with fire\nweapons were ready to fight against the Pandavas and their allies. But when\nthe rajah, whose name was Babhru-vahana, discovered that the horse bore the\nname of Yudhishthira, he said: "Arjuna is my sire;" and he went forth and made\nobeisance, and put his head under the foot of the Pandava hero. But Arjuna\nspurned him, saying: "If I were thy sire, thou wouldst have no fear of me."\n\nThen the rajah challenged Arjuna to battle, and was victorious on that day. 1\nHe took all the great men prisoners, and he severed Arjuna\'s head from his\nbody with a crescent-bladed arrow. The rajah\'s mother, Chitrangada, was\nstricken with sorrow, as was also Ulupi, the daughter of Vasuka, the king of\nserpents, who had borne a son to Arjuna. But Ulupi remembered that her sire\npossessed a magic jewel which had power to restore a dead man to life, and she\nsent the rajah of Manipura to obtain it from the underworld. But the Nagas\nrefused to give up the jewel, whereupon Arjuna\'s mighty\n\np. 315\n\nson fought against them with arrows which were transformed into peacocks; and\nthe peacocks devoured the serpents. Then the Naga king delivered up the magic\njewel, and the rajah returned with it. He touched the body of Arjuna with the\njewel, and the hero came to life again, and all his wounds were healed. When\nhe departed from Manipura city the rajah, his son, accompanied him.\n\nSo from kingdom to kingdom the horse wandered while the army followed, until a\nyear had expired. Then it returned to Hastinapur.\n\nYudhishthira had meantime lived a life of purity and self-restraint. Each\nnight he lay upon the ground, and always slept within the city. Beside him lay\nDraupadi, and a naked sword was ever betwixt them.\n\nGreat were the rejoicings of the people when the horse came back: they made\nglad holiday, and went forth to welcome the army with gifts of fine raiment\nand jewels and flowers. Money was scattered in the streets, and the poor were\nmade happy, being thus relieved generously in their need.\n\nYudhishthira embraced Arjuna and kissed him and wept tears of gladness, and\nwelcomed Arjuna\'s son, Babhru-vahana, Rajah of Manipura, and also the other\nrajahs who had followed the sacred horse.\n\nTwelve days after the return of Arjuna, and on the day when Magha\'s full moon\nmarked the close of the winter season, the people assembled in great\nmultitudes from far and near to share Yudhishthira\'s generous hospitality and\nwitness the Aswa-medha ceremony, which was held upon a green and level portion\nof consecrated ground. Stately pavilions, glittering with jewels and gold, had\nbeen erected for the royal guests, and there were humbler places for the\nBrahmans. In thrones of\n\np. 316\n\ngold sat Maharajah Dhritarashtra and Rajah Yudhishthira, and the other rajahs\nhad thrones of sandalwood and gold. The royal ladies were ranged together in\ntheir appointed places. Wise Vyasa was there, and he directed the ceremony.\nAnd Krishna, the holy one, was there also.\n\nWhen all the guests were assembled, Yudhishthira and Draupadi bathed together\nin the sacred waters of the Ganges. Then a portion of ground was measured out,\nand Yudhishthira ploughed it with a golden plough. Draupadi followed him, and\nsowed the seeds of every kind which is sown in the kingdom, while all the\nwomen and the Brahmans chanted holy mantras. Then a golden altar was erected\nwith four broad layers of golden bricks, and stakes of sacred wood from the\nforest and from Himalaya, and it was canopied and winged with gold-brocaded\nsilk.\n\nThen eight pits were dug for Homa 1 of milk and butter to be made ready for\nthe sacrificial fire, and in skins were wrapped up portions of every kind of\nvegetable and curative herb which grew in the kingdom, and these were placed\nin the Homa pits.\n\nOn the ground there were numerous sacrificial stakes, to which were tied\ncountless animals--bulls and buffaloes and steeds, wild beasts from forest and\nmountain and cave, birds of every kind, fishes from river and lake, and even\ninsects.\n\nThe priests offered up animals in sacrifice to each celestial power, and the\nfeasting was beheld by sacred beings. The Gandharvas sang, and the Apsaras,\nwhom the Gandharvas wooed, danced like sunbeams on the grass. Messengers of\nthe gods were also gathered there, and Vyasa and his disciples chanted mantras\nto celestial music. The people lifted up their voices at the sound\n\np. 317\n\nof rain drum and the blast of the rain trumpet. Then bright was the lustre of\nYudhishthira\'s fame.\n\nWhen all the kings and royal ladies and sages took their places to be blessed\nby the horse sacrifice, Yudhishthira sat on his throne, and in his hand he\nheld the horn of a stag.\n\nVyasa sent four-and-sixty rajahs with their wives to draw water from the holy\nGanges. Many musicians went with them beating drums and blowing trumpets and\nplaying sweet instruments, and girls danced in front, going and returning. And\nall the rajahs and their wives were given splendid raiment by Yudhishthira,\nand necklaces of jewels also, and he put betelnut in their mouths one by one.\nTo the Brahmans were gifted much gold and many jewels, and elephants, horses,\nand kine, and they were well pleased.\n\nYudhishthira then sat naked in his throne, and each one who had drawn holy\nwater poured a quantity over his head; and they poured what remained over the\nhead of the sacred white horse.\n\nNakula held the horse\'s head, and said: "The horse speaketh."\n\nThose who were about him asked in loud voices: "What doth the horse reveal?"\n\nSaid Nakula: "Thus speaketh the horse--\'In other such ceremonies the horse\nwhich is sacrificed departs unto Swarga 1, but I shall rise far above Swarga,\nbecause that Krishna is here\'."\n\nThen Dhaumya, having washed the horse, gave a scimitar to Bhima with which to\nstrike off the head at a single blow. But ere this was done, Dhaumya pressed\nan ear of the holy animal, and milk flowed forth. Then he said to Bhima: "Pure\nindeed is the horse; verily the\n\np. 318\n\ngods will accept the sacrifice. Strike now, O strong one."\n\nBhima raised the scimitar and severed the head, which immediately ascended\nunto heaven and vanished from before the eyes of all. Great was the wonder and\nthe joy of the assembled multitude.\n\nKrishna and other rajahs and sages then cut open the horse\'s body, from which\na bright light issued forth. They found that the animal was pure, and Krishna\nsaid unto Yudhishthira: "This, thy sacrifice, is acceptable unto Vishnu."\n\nDraupadi was made Queen of the Sacrifice, and mantras were chanted, and she\nwas adored and given rich offerings, because of her virtue and her wisdom.\n\nThe body of the slain steed was divided, and the flesh gave forth the odour of\ncamphor. Priests lifted portions in their ladles and placed these on the\nsacrificial fire, and they made Soma. And Rajah Yudhishthira and all his\nbrethren stood in the sin-cleansing smoke and breathed its fragrance.\n\nDhaumya cried out, as he laid a piece of flesh on the altar fire: "O Indra,\naccept thou this flesh which hath turned to camphor."\n\nWhen he had uttered these words, Indra, accompanied by many gods, appeared\nbefore the people, who made obeisance with fear and secret joy. Indra took\nfrom Vyasa portions of the flesh and gave these to each of the gods. Then he\nvanished from sight with all his companions.\n\nVyasa blessed Yudhishthira, and Krishna embraced him.\n\nSaid Krishna: "Thy fame will endure for ever." Yudhishthira made answer: "Unto\nthee do I owe all these blessings."\n\np. 319\n\nThereafter Krishna and the rajahs poured holy water over the heads of\nYudhishthira and Draupadi.\n\nAll the fragments of the herbs which had been provided for Homa were then\nground into powder. And Yudhishthira gave balls of the powder to each one\npresent, so that they might eat of the sacred herbs and share in the blessings\nof the Aswa-medha. He ate his own portion last of all. The fragments of the\nofferings which remained were burnt on the altar.\n\nThen Pritha and all the maidens who were with her made merry, while the\nmusicians played gladsome airs.\n\nYudhishthira distributed more gifts. Unto Vyasa he assigned an estate, and\nbestowed upon the Brahmans who officiated many animals and pearls and slaves.\nTo the rajahs he gave war elephants and steeds and money, and to the rajahs\'\nwives bridal-night gifts of raiment and jewels and gold.\n\nBhima feasted all the Brahmans, and Yudhishthira wept as he bade farewell to\nKrishna, his friend in peace and in war, who departed in his chariot unto sea-\nwashed Dwaraka.\n\nThere was prosperity in the kingdom under Yudhishthira\'s wise and just\ngovernment; but blind old Dhritarashtra never ceased to mourn the death of\nDuryodhana, his first-born, and at length he retired to live in a humble\ndwelling in the jungle. With him went Queen Gandhari, and Pritha, the mother\nof the Pandavas, and Vidura, and others who were of great age.\n\nYears went past, and a day came when Yudhishthira and his brethren and their\nwife Draupadi journeyed to the dwelling-place of their elders. They found them\nall there save Vidura, who had departed to a sacred place on the banks of the\nGanges to undergo penance and wait for the coming of Yama, god of the dead.\nThen all the\n\np. 320\n\nkinsfolk, young and old, went forth to find Vidura; but when they came to him\nhe was wasted with hunger and great age, nor could he speak unto them. They\nwaited beside him until he died, and then they mourned together. This new\nsorrow awakened old-time grief, and they spoke of all those who had fallen in\nthe great war. Fathers and mothers lamented for their sons, and wives for\ntheir husbands. . . .\n\nWhile they wept and moaned together, the great sage Vyasa came nigh and spoke,\nsaying: "Verily, I will soothe all your sorrows. . . . Let each one bathe at\nsunset in the holy waters of the Ganges, and when night falls your lost ones\nwill return to you once again."\n\nThen they all sat waiting on the river bank until evening came on. Slowly\npassed the day; it seemed to be as long as a year.\n\nAt length the sun went down, and they chanted mantras and went into the\nGanges. Vyasa bathed beside the old Maharajah Dhritarashtra and Yudhishthira.\n. . . Then all came out and stood on the bank.\n\nSuddenly the waters began to heave and foam, and Vyasa muttered holy words and\ncalled out the names of the dead one by one. . . . Soon all the heroes who had\nbeen slain arose one by one. In chariots they came, and on horseback and\nriding upon lordly elephants. They all uttered triumphant cries; drums were\nsounded and trumpets were blown; and it seemed as if the armies of the\nPandavas and Kauravas were once again assembled for battle, for they swept\nover the river like a mighty tempest.\n\nMany of the onlookers trembled with fear, until they beheld Bhishma and Drona,\nclad in armour, standing aloft in their chariots in splendour and in pride;\nthen came Arjuna\'s son, the noble Abhimanyu, and Bhima\'s Asura,\n\n\n\n[![THE RETURN OF THE HEROES SLAIN IN BATTLE<br> <i>From the painting by\nWarwick Goble</i>.](tn/32000.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/32000.jpg)  \nTHE RETURN OF THE HEROES SLAIN IN BATTLE  \n_From the painting by Warwick Goble_.  \n\n\n\np. 321\n\nson. Soon Gandhari beheld Duryodhana and all his brethren, while Pritha looked\nwith glad eyes upon Karna, and Draupadi welcomed her brother Dhrishta-dyumna\nand her five children who had all been slain by vengeful Aswatthaman. All the\nwarriors who had fallen in battle returned again on that night of wonder.\n\nWith the host came minstrels who sang of the deeds of the heroes, and\nbeautiful girls who danced before them. All strife had ended between kinsmen\nand old-time rivals; in death there was peace and sweet companionship.\n\nThe ghostly warriors crossed the Ganges and were welcomed by those who waited\non the bank around Vyasa. It was a night of supreme and heart-stirring\ngladness. Fathers and mothers found their sons, widows clung to their\nhusbands, sisters embraced their brothers, and all wept tears of joy. The\nelders who were living conversed with those who were dead; the burdens of\ngrief and despair fell from all hearts after lone years of mourning; the past\nwas suddenly forgotten in the rapture of beholding those who had died.\n\nSwiftly passed the night as if it had endured but for an hour. Then when dawn\nbegan to break, the dead men returned to their chariots and their horses and\ntheir elephants and bade farewells. . . .\n\nVyasa spoke to the widows and said that those of them who desired to be with\ntheir husbands could depart with them. Then the Kaurava princesses and other\nhigh- born ladies, who never ceased to mourn for their own, kissed the feet of\nthe Maharajah Dhritarashtra and Queen Gandhari and plunged into the Ganges\nwith the departing hosts. . . . Vyasa chanted mantras, and all the drowned\nwidows were transported to heaven with their husbands. . . .\n\nThe Pandavas returned to Hastinapur, and when two years had gone past a new\nsorrow fell upon them. One\n\np. 322\n\nday Narada, the sage, stood before Yudhishthira and told that a great fire had\nswept through the jungle, and that Dhritarashtra, and Gandhari, and Pritha,\nand all who were with them, had perished.\n\nSoon afterwards the Pandavas came to know, by reason of dread omens which\nappeared, that a great calamity was drawing nigh, but no man could tell what\nit was or when it would take place.\n\nEre long it became known that the city of Dwaraka was doomed to be destroyed.\nA horror in human shape was beheld in the night; it was coloured yellow and\nblack, its head was bald and its limbs misshapen, and men said it was Yama,\ngod of the dead. . . . Visions of headless men contending in battle were\nbeheld at sunset. . . . The moon was eclipsed, a dread tempest ravaged the\nland, and a plague of rats afflicted the city.\n\nKrishna forbade all the people, on pain of death, to drink wine, and commanded\nthem to perform devotions on the seashore. . . .\n\nThen the night was haunted by a black woman with yellow teeth who grinned\nhorribly at house doors. All the inhabitants of the city were stricken with\nterror. . . . Evil spirits came also and robbed the jewels of the women and\nthe weapons of the men. . . . At length the chakra 1 of Krishna went up to\nheaven, and his chariot and horses followed it. . . . The end of the Yadavas\nwas not afar off, and the day came when Apsaras called out of heaven: "Depart\nfrom hence," and all the people heard them.\n\nWhen the people gathered on the seashore they held a feast, and being allowed\nto drink wine for one day, they drank heavily and began to quarrel. At length\nSatyaki slew Kritavarman, who had gone to the Pandava camp with Drona\'s son on\nthe night of slaughter. Then\n\np. 323\n\n[paragraph continues] Kritavarman\'s friends killed Satyaki and one of\nKrishna\'s sons. Krishna slew the rebels, but he could not quell the tumult and\nthe fighting which ensued; fathers slew their sons, and sons their fathers,\nand kinsmen contended fiercely against kinsmen.\n\nThen Krishna and Balarama left the city, and both died in the jungle. From\nBalarama\'s mouth issued a mighty snake, for he was the incarnation of the\nworld serpent. . . . Krishna was mistaken for a gazelle by a hunter, who shot\nan arrow which pierced his foot at the only spot where he could be mortally\nwounded. He then departed to his heaven, which is called Goloka.\n\nEre Krishna had left Dwaraka he caused messengers to hasten for Arjuna, who\ncame speedily, to find the women wailing for the dead. Then Vasudeva, father\nof Krishna, died, and Arjuna laid the body of the old man upon the pyre, and\nhe was burned with four of his widows, who no longer desired to live. The\nbodies of Krishna and Balarama were cremated also.\n\nArjuna then set forth towards Indra-prastha with a remnant of the people; and\nwhen they had left Dwaraka, the sea rose up and swallowed the whole city, with\nthose who had refused to depart from it. . . . Such was the end of the power\nof the Yadavas.\n\nDeep gloom fell upon the Pandavas after this, and Vyasa, the sage, appeared\nbefore them, and revealed that their time had come to depart from the world.\n\nThen Yudhishthira divided the kingdom. He made Parikshit, son of Abhimanyu,\nRajah of Hastinapur; and Yuyutsu, the half-brother of Duryodhana, who had\njoined the Pandava army on the first day of the great war, was made Rajah of\nHastinapur. He counselled them to live at peace one with another.\n\nThe Pandavas afterwards cast off their royal garments\n\np. 324\n\nand their jewels and put on the garb of hermits, and the bright-eyed and\nfaithful Draupadi did likewise. Yudhishthira departed first of all, and his\nbrethren walked behind him one by one, and Draupadi went last of all, followed\nby a hound. They all walked towards the rising sun, and by the long circuitous\npath which leads to Mount Meru, through forests and over streams and across\nthe burning plains, never again to return.\n\nOne by one they fell by the way, all save Yudhishthira. Draupadi was the first\nto sink down, and Bhima cried: "Why hath she fallen who hath never done\nwrong?"\n\nSaid Yudhishthira: "Her heart was bound up in Arjuna, and she hath her\nreward."\n\nSahadeva was next to fall, and then Nakula. At length Yudhishthira heard the\nvoice of Bhima crying in distress: "Lo! now the noble Arjuna hath fallen. What\nsin hath he committed?"\n\nSaid Yudhishthira: "He boasted confidently that he could destroy all his\nenemies in one day, and because he failed in his vow he hath fallen by the\nway."\n\nThe two surviving brothers walked on in silence; but the time came when mighty\nBhima sank down. He cried: "O Yudhishthira say, if thou canst tell, why I have\nfallen now.\n\nSaid Yudhishthira: "O wolf-bellied one, because of thy cursing and gluttony\nand thy pride thou hast fallen by the way."\n\nYudhishthira walked on, calm and unmoved, followed by his faithful hound. When\nhe drew nigh to sacred Mount Meru, the world-spine, Indra, king of the gods,\ncarne forth to welcome him, saying: "Ascend, O resolute prince."\n\nSaid Yudhishthira: "Let my brethren who have fallen\n\np. 325\n\nby the way come with me also. I cannot enter heaven without them, O king of\nthe gods. Let the fair and gentle princess come too; Draupadi hath been a\nfaithful wife, and is worthy of bliss. Hear my prayer, O Indra, and have\nmercy."\n\nSaid Indra: "Thy brethren and Draupadi have gone before thee."\n\nThen Yudhishthira pleaded that his faithful hound should enter heaven also;\nbut Indra said: "Heaven is no place for those who are followed by hounds.\nKnowest thou not that demons rob religious ordinances of their virtues when\ndogs are nigh?"\n\nSaid Yudhishthira: "No evil can come from the noble. I cannot have joy if I\ndesert this faithful friend."\n\nIndra said: "Thou didst leave behind thy brethren and Draupadi. Why,\ntherefore, canst thou not abandon thine hound?"\n\nSaid Yudhishthira: "I have no power to bring back to life those who have\nfallen by the way: there can be no abandonment of the dead."\n\nAs he spake, the hound was transformed, and behold Dharma, god of justice,\nstood by the rajah\'s side.\n\nDharma said: "O Yudhishthira, thou art indeed mine own son. Thou wouldst not\nabandon me, thy hound, because that I was faithful unto thee. Thine equal\ncannot he found in heaven."\n\nThen Yudhishthira was transported to the city of eternal bliss, and there he\nbeheld Duryodhana seated upon a throne. All the Kauravas were in heaven also,\nbut the rajah could not find his brethren or fair Draupadi.\n\nSaid Indra: "Here thou shalt dwell, O Yudhishthira, in eternal bliss. Forget\nall earthly ties and attain to perfection; thy brethren have fallen short,\ntherefore they sank by the way."\n\np. 326\n\nYudhishthira said: "I cannot remain here with the Kauravas who have done me\ngreat wrong. Where my brethren are, there would I be also with our wife\nDraupadi."\n\nThen a celestial being conducted Yudhishthira to the abode of his brethren and\nthe Princess of Panchala. He entered the forest of the nether regions, where\nthe leaves were like to sharp weapons and the path was covered with knives.\nDarkness hung heavily, and the way was miry with blood and strewn with foul\nand mutilated corpses. Shapes of horror flitted round about like to shadows;\nfierce birds of prey feasted upon human flesh. The damned were burning in\neverlasting fires, and the air reeked with foul odours. A boiling river went\npast, and Yudhishthira saw the place of torture with thorns, and the desert of\nfiery sand: he gazed mutely upon each horror that was unfolded before his\neyes.\n\nFain would Yudhishthira have turned back, but he heard in the darkness the\nvoices of his brethren and Draupadi bidding him to stay a little while to\ncomfort them while they suffered torment.\n\nThen Yudhishthira said to the celestial being: "Depart now from me, for I must\nremain here to assuage the sufferings of my brethren and Draupadi."\n\nAs he spake the gods appeared, and the scene of horror vanished from before\nthe eyes of Yudhishthira, for it was an illusion conjured up to test his\nconstancy.\n\nThen Yudhishthira was led to the heavenly Ganges, and having bathed in its\nsacred waters, he cast off his mortal body and became a celestial. Then,\nrejoicing, he entered Swarga, the celestial city of Indra, and was welcomed by\nKrishna in all his divine glory, and by his brethren and by Draupadi, and all\nwhom he had loved upon earth.\n\np. 327\n\nIndra spoke and said: "This is the beautiful and immortal one, who sprang from\nthe altar to be thy wife, and these bright beings are her five children. Here\nis Dhritarashtra, who is now the king of the Gandharvas; there is Karna, son\nof Surya, the peerless archer who was slain by Arjuna. Here cometh towards\nthee Abhimanyu, son of Arjuna; he is now the star-bright companion of the lord\nof night. . . . Here are Pandu, thy sire, and Pritha, thy mother, now united\nin heaven. Behold! also, Yudhishthira, the wise Bhishma, whose place is with\nthe Vasus round my throne: Drona sits with Dharma, god of wisdom. Here are all\nthe peerless warriors who fell in battle and have won heaven by their valour\nand their constancy.
