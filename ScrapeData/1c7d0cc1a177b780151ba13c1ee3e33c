An arrow, swift as thought,  \n   Upon his bow he pressed,  \nAnd smote, to utmost fury wrought,  \n   Maricha on the breast.  \nDeep in his flesh the weapon lay  \n   Winged by the mystic spell,  \n\np. 45  \n\nAnd, hurled a hundred leagues away,  \n   In ocean's flood he fell.  \nThen Rama, when he saw the foe  \n   Convulsed and mad with pain  \n'Neath the chill-pointed weapon's blow,  \n   To Lakshman spoke again:  \n'See, Lakshman, see! this mortal dart  \n   That strikes a numbing chill,  \nHath struck him senseless with the smart,  \n   But left him breathing still.  \nBut these who love the evil way,  \n   And drink the blood they spill,  \nRejoicing holy rites to stay,  \n   Fierce plagues, my hand shall kill.'  \nHe seized another shaft, the best,  \n   Aglow with living flame;  \nIt struck Suvahu on the chest,  \n   And dead to earth he came.  \nAgain a dart, the Wind-God's own,  \n   Upon his string he laid,  \nAnd all the demons were o'erthrown,  \n   The saints no more afraid.  \nWhen thus the fiends were slain in fight,  \nDisturbers of each holy rite,  \nDue honour by the saints was paid  \nTo Rama for his wondrous aid:  \nSo Indra is adored when he  \nHas won some glorious victory.  \nSuccess at last the rite had crowned,  \nAnd Visvamitra gazed around,  \nAnd seeing every side at rest,  \nThe son of Raghu thus addressed:  \n'My joy, O Prince, is now complete:  \n   Thou hast obeyed my will:  \nPerfect before, this calm retreat  \n   Is now more perfect still.'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[44:1](ry034.htm#fr_169) Certain ceremonies preliminary to sacrifice.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXXIII.: The Sone.](ry035.htm)\n\n"
