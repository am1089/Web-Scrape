Thou wilt have me, O Agni, as a strong (master) of Soma\n[1](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:1:1): therefore thou hast made me the carrier (of the\ngods?) to perform worship at the sacrifice [2](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:1:2).\nSending my thoughts to the gods [3](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:1:3) I make the\n(press-) stone ready [4](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:1:4); I toil, O Agni: find thou\npleasure in thy own body [5](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:1:5).\n\n2 [1](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:2:1). Eastward we have turned the sacrifice\n[2](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:2:2); may the prayer increase. They honoured Agni with\nfuel and adoration. They have taught (him) the sacrificial ordinances of the\nsages of Heaven [3](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:2:3). Though he (Agni) is clever and\nstrong, they have sought a way for him.\n\n3\\. He has conceived freshness [1](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:3:1), the wise one of\npure [2](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:3:2) powers, he who is by his birth well allied\nwith Heaven and Earth. The gods have found Agni the conspicuous one in the\nwaters, in the work [3](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:3:3) of the sisters.\n\n4\\. The seven young (wives) [1](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:4:1) made the blessed one\ngrow who had been born white, ruddy in his growth. They ran up to him like\nmares [2](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:4:2) to a newborn foal. The gods wondered at\nAgni at his birth.\n\n5\\. Spreading with his bright limbs to the aerial space, purifying his power\n[1](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:5:1) by wise purifications, clothing himself in light,\nthe life of the waters [2](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:5:2), he creates mighty,\nperfect beauty.\n\n6\\. He has gone to (the waters) who do not eat, the undeceived ones, the young\n(daughters) of Heaven who are not clothed and (yet) are not naked.\n\np. 220\n\n[paragraph continues] Here the former young (women) having the same origin,\nthe seven sounds [1](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:6:1) have conceived one germ.\n\n7\\. His compact masses assuming every shape are spread in the womb of ghee, in\nthe streaming of honey. There the swelling milch-cows have stationed\nthemselves. Great are the parents of the wonderfully mighty (Agni) who are\nturned towards each other [1](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:7:1).\n\n8\\. Having been carried (in the waters) thou hast shone forth, O son of\nstrength, assuming wonderful shapes brilliant and fierce. The streams of honey\nand ghee drip, where the male has grown by wisdom.\n\n9\\. By (his) nature he has found his father's udder\n[1](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:9:1); he has sent forth his streams and his showers\n[2](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:9:2). Walking [3](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:9:3) hidden to\nhis dear friends he has not been hidden to the young (daughters) of Heaven\n[4](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:9:4).\n\n10\\. He bore (in his womb) the germ of the sire, of the father who begat him\n[1](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:10:1). He, being one, sucked many (nurses) rich in\nmilk [2](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:10:2). Observe for this manly, bright one the two\nwives bound in kinship, belonging to men [3](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:10:3).\n\n11\\. The great one has grown up in the wide unbounded space\n[1](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:11:1). The Waters (have made) Agni (grow): for many\nglorious ones [2](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:11:2) (have come) together\n[3](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:11:3). He lay in the womb of _Ri_ ta, the domestic\n(god) Agni, in the work [4](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:11:4) of the uterine sisters.\n\n12\\. Like a horse that carries (the prize), in the assembly of the great\n(waters) [1](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:12:1), visible to his son\n[2](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:12:2), he whose \xe2\x80\xa6 is light\n[3](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:12:3): he who as father begat the ruddy cows\n[4](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:12:4), he the son of the waters is the most manly,\nrestless [5](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:12:5) Agni.\n\n13\\. To him, the glorious son of the waters and of the plants, the blessed\nwood [1](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:13:1) has given birth, in his many shapes. Even\nthe gods, for they agreed in\n\np. 221\n\ntheir mind, honoured him who had been born the most wonderful and strong.\n\n14\\. Mighty rays of light like brilliant lightnings, milking (the sap of)\nimmortality in the boundless stable, accompanied Agni whose \xe2\x80\xa6 is light\n[1](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:14:1), who had grown up in his own house, as it were\nin secret.\n\n15\\. I magnify thee, worshipping thee with offerings; I magnify (thee)\ndesirous of thy friendship, of thy favour. Together with the gods give help to\nhim who praises thee, and protect us with thy domestic faces.\n\n16\\. As thy followers, O Agni, best leader, winning all precious (treasures),\npressing onward with fertile glory, may we overcome the godless who seek to\ncombat us.\n\n17\\. Thou hast been here as the banner of the gods, Agni, joy-giving, knowing\nall wisdom. As the domestic (god) thou hast harboured the mortals. As the\ncharioteer thou goest along straightway after the gods.\n\n18\\. The immortal, the king, has sat down in the dwelling of the mortals,\nperforming the sacrifices [1](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:18:1). He the ghee-faced one\nhas shone forth widely, Agni knowing all wisdom.\n\n19 [1](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:19:1). Come to us with thy gracious friendship,\nspeeding, great, with thy great blessings. Bestow on us plentiful victorious\nwealth; make our share glorious and adorned with fine speech.\n\n20\\. These old births of thine, O Agni, and the recent ones I have told forth\nto thee the ancient one. These great libations (of Soma) have been prepared\nfor the manly one; generation by generation _G_ atavedas has been placed (on\nthe altar).\n\n21\\. _G_ atavedas, placed (on the altar) generation\n\np. 222\n\nafter generation, is kindled by the Vi _s_ vamitras, the indefatigable (or\neverlasting). May we dwell in the grace of him the worshipful, yea, in his\nblissful kindness.\n\n22\\. Bring thou, O strong one, this sacrifice of ours to the gods, O wise one,\nas a liberal giver. Bestow on us, O Hot _ri_ , abundant food; Agni, obtain by\nsacrificing mighty wealth for us.\n\n23\\. Procure, O Agni, for ever, to him who implores thee, (the gift of)\nnourishment [1](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:23:1), the wonderful acquiring of the cow.\nMay a son be ours, offspring that continues our race. Agni, may this favour of\nthine abide with us!\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe _Ri_ shi is Vi _s_ vamitra Gathina, the metre Trish _t_ ubh.--Verse 1 =\nMS. IV, 11, 2. Verse 19 = MS. IV, 14, 15. Verse 23 = SV. I, 76; VS. XII, 51;\nTS. IV, 2, 4, 3; MS. II, 7, 11; IV, 11, 1; 12, 3.\n\nComp. on this hymn Geldner, Vedische Studien, I, 157 seq., and the article of\nRegnaud, \xc3\x89tudes Vediques, l'hymne III, 1 du Rig-Veda.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Vakshi, which is very frequent as 2nd person of vah, occurs also as\nbelonging to va _s_ (see VII, 98, 2. pitim it asya vakshi), and in this sense\nno doubt it is to be understood in our passage.--Ludwig and Geldner take\ntavasam vakshi agne as a parenthesis. G. translates: 'Du hast mich zu deinem\nSomaschenken--denn dich gelustet nach dem starken, o Agni--bestellt, dass ich\nvor den Weisen opfern soll.' To me it seems more natural to understand the\nfirst Pada as one continual clause; vakshi is accented on account of the\nlogical dependence in which this clause\n\np. 223\n\nstands, the clause being considered, even without a subordinating word, as a\ndependent one. See Delbruck, Altindische Syntax, p. 42; A. Mayr,\nSitzungsberichte der phil. hist. Classe der Kais. Akademie der Wissenschaften,\nVol. LXVIII (Vienna, 1871), 248, 259.--If we were to consider vakshi as a\nlocative infinitive (see Bartholomae's theory on such infinitives,\nIndogermanische Forschungen, II, 271 seqq.), the translation would be: 'Thou\nhast made me, O Agni, a strong carrier of Soma at the carrying (of the\noblations),' &c. I do not think, however, this interpretation of vakshi very\nprobable, nor is it, as far as I can see, favoured by any passage which\ncontains the word.--For somasya tavasam, Prof. Max Muller suggests the\ntranslation 'strong of Soma,' i. e. full of Soma.\n\nNote 2. The text has vidathe.\n\nNote 3. The traditional text has a _k_ _kh_ a di\xc2\xb4dyat, which means, 'shining\ntowards or as far as the gods.' The verb di with a _k_ _kh_ a occurs still in\ntwo other passages of this Ma _n_ _d_ ala, in 15, 5 and 55, 3. In the first of\nthese passages the text seems to be correct: deva\xc2\xb4n a _k_ _kh_ a di\xc2\xb4dyana _h_\n, 'shining as far as the gods.' In the second passage I believe that we ought\nto read a _k_ _kh_ a didhye purvya\xc2\xb4 _n_ i, 'I think of the ancient things,' or\nmore exactly, 'I send my thoughts to the ancient things.' In the same way it\nseems to me very probable that in our verse di\xc2\xb4dhyat would be the correct\nreading, for the participle refers to the priest who says of himself, 'I make\nthe stone ready;' and this priest does not send his light (di\xc2\xb4dyat) but his\nthoughts (di\xc2\xb4dhyat) to the gods. Comp. I, 132, 5 = 139, 1. deva\xc2\xb4n a _k_ _kh_ a\nna dhitaya _h_ ; III, 4, 3, and numerous passages which represent the mati,\nthe gira _h_ , &c., as going towards (a _k_ _kh_ a) the gods, such as III, 39,\n1; 42, 3; VII, 10, 3; 36, 9; X, 43, 1; 47, 6.--Prof. von Roth (Zeitschrift der\nD. Morg. Ges., XLVIII, 108) speaks of the 'haufige Verwechslungen von Formen\nder beiden Wurzeln 2 di scheinen und 1 dhi wahrnehmen, denken.' The reading\ndi\xc2\xb4dyat in our verse, and didye III, 55, 3, may rest on the influence of III,\n15, 3. deva\xc2\xb4n a _k_ _kh_ a di\xc2\xb4dyana _h_.\n\np. 224\n\nNote 4. On the accent of yu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ e the same may be said as above (note 1)\nregarding the accent of vakshi.\n\nNote 5. I. e. cause the fire to flare up.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. The verses 2, 3, and 4 have been translated by Bergaigne, Religion\nVedique, I, 109.\n\nNote 2. Many sacrificial rites are performed from west to cast; comp. with\nregard to the Barhis, I, 188, 4; X, 110, 4; with regard to the sacrificial\nladle, III, 6, 1; V, 28, 1; to the Havirdhanas, Va _g_ as. Sa _m_ hita V, 17.\nThus the whole sacrifice is spoken of as proceeding in an eastward direction;\nsee X, 66, 12. pra\xc2\xb4 _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ am na _h_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ am pra nayata; X, 87, 9. ya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ am pra\xc2\xb4 _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ am \xe2\x80\xa6 pra naya.\n\nNote 3. Comp. Mahabharata XIV, 280. tasmat svaya _m_ _s_ adhi ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ e\nvidha\xc2\xb4nam. Vidatha indeed is here an equivalent of vidhana.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. The meaning seems to be that Agni won vigour (maya _h_ ) by dwelling\nin the waters (see Pada 3); comp. the well-known words a\xc2\xb4pa _h_ hi stha maya\n_h_ -bhuva _h_ (X, 9, I), 'for you, O waters, give vigour.'\n\nNote 2. More exactly, of purified faculties.\n\nNote 3. The accent apasi, instead of apasi, looks very suspicious. It is easy,\nbut perhaps too easy, to correct apasi, as possibly in III, 6, 7. apa _h_\nshould be read for apa _h_. (In I, 31, 8; 151, 4 Grassmann is wrong in\nassuming a neutral stem apas- 'die Arbeit.') To me Ludwig's conjecture upasi\n(in the lap of the sisters, i. e. of the waters) seems excellent. Upasi occurs\nin V, 43, 7; X, 27, 13 in the meaning of upasthe. Thus upasi svas _r i_ _n_ am\nwould be the same as apa\xc2\xb4m upasthe; comp. I, 144, 2; VI, 8, 4; IX, 86, 25; X,\n45, 3; 46, 1. 2, &c.--Comp. below, verse 11, note 4.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Of course the seven wives are the rivers or waters.\n\np. 225\n\nNote 2. I cannot adopt Prof. Weber's conjecture asv\xcc\x83a _h_ (Altiranische\nSternnamen, 10). His translation is: 'Die Gotter liefen zu dem wundersamen\nAgni bei seiner Geburt (neugierig) hinzu, wie die jungen Madchen zu einem\nneugebornen Kinde.'\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. For kratum punana _h_ , cf. III, 31, 16; VIII, 12, 11; 13, I; 53, 6.\n\nNote 2. I take pari as belonging to vasana _h_ ; _s_ o _k_ i _h_ and a\xc2\xb4yu _h_\nare objects. Comp. X, 16, 5. a\xc2\xb4yu _h_ vasana _h_ ; X, 53, 3. sa _h_ a\xc2\xb4yu _h_\na\xc2\xb4 aga\xc2\xb4t surabhi _h_ vasana _h_.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. The number of the seven sounds (comp. Sten Konow, Das Samavidhana-\nbra\xc2\xb4hma _n_ a, p. 33, note 3) seems to be connected with the seven _Ri_ shis,\nsee IX, 103, 3. va\xc2\xb4 _n_ i _h_ _r i_shi _n_ am sapta (comp. IX, 62, 17). The\nseven sounds seem to be identified with the seven rivers also in III, 7, 1\n(see below). Comp. Bergaigne, Religion Vedique, II, 132; H. O., Religion des\nVeda, 117, note 1.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. Heaven and Earth.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. Comp. Bergaigne, Religion Vedique, II, 99.\n\nNote 2. See volume xxxii, 441 seq. (I, 2, 3, note 1).\n\nNote 3. Here I believe we have an anacoluthon. The poet seems to have intended\nto say, 'Him who walked \xe2\x80\xa6 the daughters of Heaven saw.'--Prof. Max Muller\ntranslates this hemistich: 'He found him (the father) moving along with dear\nfriends, with the young maidens of Heaven--he was not hidden.'\n\nNote 4. Agni was hidden to the gods but not to the waters.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. The verse X, 3, 2, though very obscure, seems to contain a similar\nidea. Should the meaning be that\n\np. 226\n\n[paragraph continues] Agni bears in his womb the Dawn, the daughter of Heaven?\n\nNote 2. The waters.\n\nNote 3. This phrase, which I have translated as literally as possible, is very\nobscure. The two wives seem to be wives of Agni. Are they Night and Dawn (the\ntwo sabardughe, III, 55, 12?), whose designation as 'belonging to men' seems\nnot to be impossible? Or the two kindling-sticks (comp. V, 47, 5)? Or the two\nDarvis (V, 6, 9)?\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. Comp. V, 42, 17. urau deva _h_ anibadhe syama.\n\nNote 2. This is feminine.\n\nNote 3. The phrase ya _s_ asa _h_ sam hi purvi\xc2\xb4 _h_ occurs also X, 46, 10. It\nmay have been, as Geldner believes, a proverbial locution. But the verb which\nit is most natural to supply, seems to be gam (i, ya), so that the meaning may\nhave been: 'Many superior (wives) are wont to assemble,' i. e. where one such\nwife is, there will be many. This is applied here to the waters, in X, 46, 10\nto such beings as isha _h_ , utaya _h_ or the like. That ya _s_ as may be\nmeant for the waters is shown by VII, 36, 6, where the ya _s_ asa _h_ vava _s_\nana\xc2\xb4 _h_ , mentioned by the side of Sarasvati, evidently are the waters.--It\nshould be observed that several expressions of this hymn have been made use of\nby the author of X, 46.\n\nNote 4. Or rather 'in the lap' (upasi). Comp. above, verse 3, note 3.\n\n##### Verse 12.\n\nNote 1. With regard to akra _h_ I adopt the translation proposed by Geldner\n(Ved. Studien, I, 168).--On the accent of mahi\xc2\xb4nam, see Lanman, p. 398.\n\nNote 2. This seems to be the human worshipper. I cannot follow Prof. von Roth,\nZeitschrift der D. Morg. Gesellschaft, XLVIII, 118, who explains sunave as a\ncorrupt third person of the verb su.\n\nNote 3. See above, I, 44, 3, note 1.\n\np. 227\n\nNote 4. The dawns.\n\nNote 5. Comp. above, I, 36, 1, note 2.\n\n##### Verse 13.\n\nNote 1. Vana: the wood considered as a wife.\n\n##### Verse 14.\n\nNote 1. See verse 12, note 3.\n\n##### Verse 18.\n\nNote 1. The text has vidathani.\n\n##### Verse 19.\n\nNote 1. Comp. Kuhn, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, I, p. 445.\n\n##### Verse 23.\n\nNote 1. \xc3\x8d _l_ am. which more especially means the nourishing substance of the\ncow. Comp. H. O., Religion des Veda, 72, 326.--Prof. Max Muller translates:\n'Procure to him who implores thee, O Agni, exuberant land for ever, rich in\ncows.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2.
