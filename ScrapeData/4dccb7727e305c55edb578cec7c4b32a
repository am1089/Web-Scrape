Vyasa said :-- On hearing the sound words of his daughter S\xc2\x92as\xc2\x92ikala,\npregnant with reason, Subahu the king of Benares, became very anxious and\nbegan to think what he would now, so short a space of time in this momentous\noccasion, thus :--\n\n\n\n2-3. \xc2\x93The powerful kings, all, have come here on intention that they would\nfight and therefore they are all attended with their armies and followers\nrespectively; and they are now sitting on their respective daises in the\nSvayamvara hall. If I go now and tell them that my daughter\n\n\n\np. 205\n\n\n\nS\xc2\x92as\xc2\x92ikala is not willing to come of her own accord in the hall, the evil\nminded kings will certainly kill me out of their wrath.\n\n\n\n4\\. I have not so much strength, whether in my army or in forts, as to be able\nto decline these kings and drive them away from my kingdom.\n\n\n\n5\\. Sudars\xc2\x92ana, too is, alone, helpless, wealthless, and a mere boy. What\nshall I do now? Alas! I am now plunged in deep sorrow.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n6\\. Thinking thus, with head bowed down by humility, the king went to the\nkings, and said thus :--\n\n\n\n7\\. \xc2\x93O Kings! The girl, though requested repeatedly by me and her mother, is\nnot willing to come to this hall. What can I do now?\n\n\n\n8-9. I am your servant and, bowing my head at the feet of you all, pray to\nyou, to accept my worship and return to your own cities respectively. I am\nready to give a sufficient quantity of gems and jewels, clothes, elephants,\nchariots. Kindly accept these and go back to your own homes.\n\n\n\n10\\. My daughter is as yet a girl; if I chastise her, she may commit suicide;\nand I will be exceedingly sorry; therefore I am very much distressed with this\nthought.\n\n\n\n11\\. You all are fortunate, energetic, and of a merciful disposition; what\nwill it serve you to accept the daughter of mine, who is disobedient and\nunfortunate?\n\n\n\n12\\. I am your obedient servant; shew your mercy on me and it is your duty to\nconsider my daughter as your own daughter.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n13\\. Vyasa said :-- Hearing Subahu's words, the kings did not utter a single\nword; but Yudhajit, with his eyes reddened out of wrath, began to address the\nking of Benares in an angry tone :--\n\n\n\n14\\. \xc2\x93O King! You are a veteran fool; what do you say now after committing a\nmost blameable act? Had you any doubt as to your proceedings, why have you,\nout of sheer delusion, called this meeting hall of Svayamvara, without\nthinking the matter before-hand.\n\n\n\n15\\. You have invited the kings and princes in this marriage ceremony\nSvayamvara; and they all have assembled here; how can they now go back to\ntheir homes?\n\n\n\n16\\. Are you going now to insult these? and will you give your daughter in\nmarriage to Sudars\xc2\x92ana? Nothing can be more ignoble than this?\n\n\n\n17\\. The welfare-seeking person ought to judge before-hand and then to act.\nBut you have started your work without any previous judgment and decision. You\nwill have to reap its fruit; there is no doubt this.\n\n\n\np. 206\n\n\n\n18\\. Why are you now thinking of giving your daughter to this helpless,\nwealthless Sudars\xc2\x92ana in the presence of kings that are powerful and that\ncommand a great militia.\n\n\n\n19\\. O thou most sinful! Today I will certainly kill you; next I will kill\nSudars\xc2\x92ana and then give your daughter to my daughter\xc2\x92s son; know that this is\nmy firm resolve.\n\n\n\n20\\. Who is there, when I am standing, in this assembly that can aspire to\ncarry away the bridegroom elect by force or theft? Nothing to speak of\nSudars\xc2\x92ana who is powerless, wealthless and a mere boy!\n\n\n\n21\\. I spared his life before in the hermitage of Bharadvaja at the Muni\xc2\x92s\nrequest; but today I will not spare the boy under any circumstances\nwhatsoever.\n\n\n\n22\\. Therefore, please go and consult with your wife and daughter and give\nyour dear beautiful daughter to my daughter\xc2\x92s son.\n\n\n\n23\\. Be engaged in a marriage tie with me by giving your exquisitely beautiful\ndaughter to my daughter\xc2\x92s son. You can very well judge that it is always\nproper and advisable that a great man shall come under the protection of\nanother great man.\n\n\n\n24\\. What happiness can you expect from this Sudars\xc2\x92ana, who is helpless and\nbanished from his kingdom, that you are going to give him your dear and\nauspicious daughter!\n\n\n\n25\\. Family, wealth, army, appearance, kingdoms, forts and true friends and\nother helping persons; these a man should consider when he is going to give\naway his daughter in marriage to anybody; else there is no surety of\nhappiness. Think over the royal custom and the never failing Dharma and do\nwhat is proper. Never it is advisable to do any act, abandoning the path of\nDharma and morals.\n\n\n\n26\\. You are my intimate friend; therefore I am telling you these good words.\nO king! Better bring your daughter, surrounded by her attendant maids, in this\nhall of Svayamvara.\n\n\n\n27\\. Let this daughter select any man other than Sudars\xc2\x92ana; I have got no\ncause of quarrel; and the marriage will then be celebrated according to your\nwill.\n\n\n\n28-29. O best of kings! The other kings are all of high descent; and they have\narmies and are all in positions befitting your connection! If the daughter\nchooses any one amongst them, then no quarrels would arise. But if the\ndaughter chooses Sudars\xc2\x92ana, then certainly I will carry her by force.\nTherefore, O king! act in such a way that no quarrels occur in future.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\np. 207\n\n\n\n30-31. Vyasa said :-- Thus addressed by Yudhajit, the king of Benares was very\nsorrowful, and, after a heavy sigh, went to his palace and told with a grieved\nheart to his wife, thus :-- \xc2\x93O fair eyed one! Now I am completely under your\ncontrol; you better explain to S\xc2\x92as\xc2\x92ikala that a dreadful quarrel is now to\noccur; what am I to do now?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n32-33. Vyasa said :-- Hearing her husband's words, the queen went to her\ndaughter and spoke thus :-- \xc2\x93O child! Quarrels have now ensued amongst the\nkings for your sake; your father has become very sorrowful; therefore, O fair\none! Choose any other man your husband than Sudars\xc2\x92ana.\n\n\n\n34-35. O Child! If you do not judge and rashly choose Sudars\xc2\x92ana, then the\npowerful king Yudhajit, possessing a large army, will no doubt kill you, me\nand Sudars\xc2\x92ana. It might be, if quarrels ensue, you might be married to\nanother husband; therefore better think now and act.\n\n\n\n36\\. O dear eyed! It is now your incumbent duty to choose another king for\nyour husband, if you want your and my welfare and happiness. Leave\nSudars\xc2\x92ana.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n37\\. The mother thus advised her daughter; the king, too, afterwards explained\nand tried to convince her. The girl spoke fearlessly.\n\n\n\n38\\. \xc2\x93O king! What you have said is all true; but you know my firm resolve\nalready. I won't ever select any other king than Sudars\xc2\x92ana.\n\n\n\n39-40. O king! If you are afraid and be in agony, then do this thing: better\ngive me in marriage to Sudars\xc2\x92ana and then drive us away from your city. He\nwill put me in his chariot and go away out of your city. After that what is\ninevitable will surely come to pass. There cannot be anything otherwise.\n\n\n\n41\\. O king! You need not fear anything about what is kept in the womb of\nfuture by Destiny. What is inevitable will happen; there is no doubt in this.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n42\\. The king said :-- \xc2\x93O child! The intelligent persons never show too much\nrashness and insolence. The learned people, versed in the Vedas, say it is\nnever advisable to quarrel with many persons.\n\n\n\n43\\. How can I give my daughter in marriage to one and then banish them both?\nThe kings have turned out enemies. There is no heinous crime, that they cannot\ncommit now.\n\n\n\n44\\. O child! If it be your opinion, I can pledge something as a pawn for your\nmarriage, as the king Janaka pledged in days of yore for her daughter Sita.\n\n\n\n45-47. I will also put forward a pawn very difficult to be carried out, as\nJanaka originally made an offer of the hands of Sita to whomsoever, who would\nbreak the S\xc2\x92iva\xc2\x92s strong bow. Thus the quarrels amongst the kings might\n\n\n\np. 208\n\n\n\nbe diminished; for he who will be able to fulfill the promise, will be able to\naccept you. Then, be he Sudars\xc2\x92ana or any other king, whoever will be strong\nto fulfill the promise will take you as his wife.\n\n\n\n48\\. Thus the quarrels will cease and I will also be able to perform your\nmarriage ceremony in peace and happiness.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n49\\. The daughter said :-- \xc2\x93Father! On hearing from you, I am merged in an\nocean of doubt, for it seems to me what you are saying is the act of a fool;\nalready, I have chosen in my mind Sudars\xc2\x92ana for my husband; now it cannot be\notherwise.\n\n\n\n50\\. O king! The mind is the source of virtue and vice. When I have mentally\nselected, how can I now forego him and choose another?\n\n\n\n51-52. O king! If you keep any pledge, then I will be subject to any and\neverybody; if one, two, or more fulfill the same pledge, I will be then\nsubject to any or all of them. Father! in that case quarrels may arise. What\nshall I do then? I cannot give my vote on this doubtful point.\n\n\n\n53\\. O king! You need not fear anything. Better give me in marriage to\nSudars\xc2\x92ana according to the prescribed rules; then, in that case, the Goddess\nChandika will certainly protect us.\n\n\n\n54\\. O king! Taking Whose Name destroys a whole host of sins, take Her Name\nand think the Almighty and perform carefully our marriage ceremony.\n\n\n\n55\\. Better go to the king's assembly today, and, with folded hands, tell them\ncome tomorrow to the hall of Svayamvara.\n\n\n\n56-57. Thus bidding goodbye to the kings, perform in the right spirit,\naccording to the prescribed rites, our marriage ceremony. Next, after giving\nfit dowries and other articles after the marriage, better tell the prince\nSudars\xc2\x92ana to depart. The son of Dhruvasandhi will take me away with him.\n\n\n\n58\\. If, at this, the kings get angry and be ready to quarrel with you, then\nin that case, the Goddess Bhagavati will no doubt help us.\n\n\n\n59\\. Sudars\xc2\x92ana then will fight against those kings; and if he loses his life\nperchance in the battle, then I will also follow him and die.\n\n\n\n60\\. O king! Let all good come unto you! Better give me in marriage to\nSudars\xc2\x92ana and remain here with your army. I will go alone with him, the\nobject of my love.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n61\\. Vyasa said :-- Hearing these words from her daughter, the king Subahu\ntrusted her, and firmly resolved to act according to that, and to celebrate\nthe marriage of S\xc2\x92as\xc2\x92ikala.\n\n\n\nThus ends the 21st chapter on the king of Benares fulfilling the advice of his\ndaughter in S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda\nVyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 22](bk03ch22.htm)\n\n"
