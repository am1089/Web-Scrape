Thou, O Agni, art Varu _n_ a, when born; thou becomest Mitra when kindled.\nIn thee, O son of strength, the Vi _s_ vedevas (dwell). Thou art Indra for the\nmortal worshipper.\n\n2\\. Thou becomest Aryaman when thou bearest [1](sbe46107.htm#an_5:3:2:1) the\nsecret name of the maidens, O self-dependent one. They anoint (thee) with cows\n[2](sbe46107.htm#an_5:3:2:2) like the well-established Mitra\n[3](sbe46107.htm#an_5:3:2:3), when thou makest husband and wife one-minded.\n\n3\\. For thy glory the Maruts have cleansed themselves\n[1](sbe46107.htm#an_5:3:3:1), who are thy fair and brilliant offspring, O\nRudra [2](sbe46107.htm#an_5:3:3:2)! The footprint of Vish _n_ u which is put\ndown in the highest place: therewith thou protectest the secret name of the\ncows.\n\n4\\. By thy beauty, O god, the gods are beautiful to behold\n[1](sbe46107.htm#an_5:3:4:1). Assuming many (powers or goods) they attached\nthemselves to immortality. Men have set down Agni as the Hot _ri_ , the U _s_\ni _g_ s, honouring (him), the praise of \xc3\x82yu [2](sbe46107.htm#an_5:3:4:2).\n\n5\\. There is no (other) Hot _ri_ before thee, a better sacrificer\n[1](sbe46107.htm#an_5:3:5:1); no one surpasses thee, O self-dependent one, by\nwisdom. And that house of which thou art the guest, he\n[2](sbe46107.htm#an_5:3:5:2), O god, will overcome the mortals by his\nsacrifice.\n\n6\\. May we overcome the mortals, O Agni, protected by thee, striving for\nwealth, awaking (thee) with offerings; may we (overcome mortals) in the\ncontest, in the distribution [1](sbe46107.htm#an_5:3:6:1) of days; may we\n(overcome them) by wealth, O son of strength!\n\np. 372\n\n7\\. If a man should turn upon us sin or guilt, bring ye the evil on him who\npronounces evil spells (against us). Destroy, O knowing one, such a curse, O\nAgni, (of a man) who injures us by falsehood.\n\n8\\. Thee, O god, the ancient (mortals) have made their messenger at the break\nof this (dawn), and have sacrificed with their oblations, when thou goest\nalong, O Agni, in the abode of wealth, a god kindled by the mortals and by the\nVasus.\n\n9\\. Protect the father--drive away (evil) as the knowing one--(the father) who\nis considered [1](sbe46107.htm#an_5:3:9:1) as thy son, O son of strength\n[2](sbe46107.htm#an_5:3:9:2). When, O sapient (Agni), wilt thou look upon us?\nWhen wilt thou, who knowest _Ri_ ta, requite (human deeds)?\n\n10\\. The father [1](sbe46107.htm#an_5:3:10:1) adoring gives many names to\nthee, O Vasu, if thou shouldst take pleasure therein. Will not Agni,\ndelighting in his divine power, grant us his favour, he who has grown strong?\n\n11\\. Thou indeed, O Agni, youngest one, bringest thy praiser across all\ndangers. Thieves have been seen and deceitful men; dishonest people have come\nwith unknown designs.\n\n12\\. These our processions have been directed towards thee. Yes, to thee, the\nVasu, this guilt has been confessed. Verily this Agni, grown strong, will\nnever surrender us to the curse nor to him who does harm to us.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe _Ri_ shi is Vasu _s_ ruta \xc3\x82treya; the metre is Trish _t_ ubh.--No verse of\nthis hymn occurs in the other Sa _m_ hitas.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. I think that we must read bibharshi.\n\np. 373\n\nNote 2. I. e. with butter.\n\nNote 3. On Mitra as the god of alliances, and the anointing of Mitra--possibly\nof an object that represents Mitra--see H. O., Religion des 2, p. 186, note 1.\nCf. also Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 92 seq.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. I. e. they have adorned themselves. Cf. VII, 39, 3. ura\xc2\xb4v antarikshe\nmar _g_ ayanta subhra\xc2\xb4 _h_.\n\nNote 2. Rudra of course is here a name of Agni.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Sud _r i_ _s_ a _h_ , which I have translated as nom. plur., may also\nbe understood as gen. sing.: 'by thy beauty, who art beautiful to behold, O\ngod, the gods, assuming, &c.'\n\nNote 2. Cf. Nara _s_ a _m_ sa.--This hemistich is nearly identical with IV, 6,\n11.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Comp. above, III, 17, 5.\n\nNote 2. The construction is rather free.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Vidatheshu ahnam: cf. above, I, 31, 6, note 2 ([p.\n26](sbe46008.htm#page_26) seq.).\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. See Neisser, Bezzenberger's Beitrage, XVIII, 310.\n\nNote 2. Bergaigne (Religion Vedique, II, 103) proposes to read yodhi without\naccent and to derive it, as Delbruck does, from yu (not from yudh); he\ntranslates the first hemistich: 'Protege-nous, ecarte le pere qui passe pour\nton fils.' I think that he is right as to the verb yu, but that the accent of\nyodhi is correct; the words yodhi vidva\xc2\xb4n form a parenthesis. Agni is invoked\nto protect the father of the sacrificing tribe (comp. verse to), or the father\nof\n\np. 374\n\n[paragraph continues] Agni himself, i. e. the sacrificer or the priest, who is\nhimself considered, at the same time, as the son of Agni (see Bergaigne, I, 37\nseq.; Geldner, Vedische Studien, I, 167).\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. 'The father' may either be the father spoken of in verse 9 (see verse\n9, note 2). Or the word may refer to Agni: 'He who adores thee, gives many\nnames to thee, if thou, the father, O Vasu, &c.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 4](sbe46108.htm)\n\n"
