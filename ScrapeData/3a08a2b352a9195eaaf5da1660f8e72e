The scripture says the Self is\nunborn, everlasting; this is the hidden Self, distinguished neither as what\nexists nor what has no existence.\n\nThe beholder of every change in things that change, can be the unchanging\nalone; in the mind\'s desires, in dreams, in dreamless sleep the insubstantial\nnature of things that change is clearly perceived again and again.\n\nTherefore put away the false selfhood of this fleshly body, for the false\nselfhood of the body is built up by thought; knowing the Self as thine own,\nunhurt by the three times, undivided illumination, enter into peace.\n\nPut away the false selfhood of family and race and name, of form and rank, for\nthese dwell in this body; put away the actorhood and other powers of the body\nof form; become the Self whose self is partless joy.\n\nOther bonds of man are seen, causes of birth and death, but the root and first\nform of them is selfishness.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Power of Mind-Images](cjw09.htm)\n\n'
