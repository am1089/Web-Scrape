Many 1 are the oblations, in the building of the fire-altar, as\nwell as at any other (special ceremony) than the building of the fire-altar.\nFor there are supernumerary rites,--supernumerary are those which are\n(performed) over and above another rite: of these 2 are the building of the\naltar (Agni _k_ itya), the Ra _g_ asuya, the Va _g_ apeya, and the A _s_\nvamedha; and because they are over and above the other (normal) rites,\ntherefore they are supernumerary.\n\np. 247\n\n6:6:1:22\\. A cake 1 on eleven potsherds to Agni and Vish _n_ u,--that is the\ninitiation (offering) of the (Soma) sacrifice;--one on twelve potsherds to Vai\n_s_ vanara, and a pap to the \xc3\x82dityas,--these two belong to Agni.\n\n6:6:1:33\\. Now were he to prepare only the one for Agni and Vish _n_ u, and\nnot the other two oblations, then only the initiation (offering) of the (Soma)\nsacrifice would be performed, and not those of Agni (the fire-altar); and were\nhe to prepare only the other two oblations, and not the one to Agni and Vish\n_n_ u, only the initiation (offering) of Agni would be performed, and not that\nof the sacrifice.\n\n6:6:1:44\\. He prepares both that of the sacrifice, and those of Agni, for this\nrite is both a rite of sacrifice, and a rite of fire: first (comes) that of\nthe sacrifice, and then that of the fire, for the rite of the fire is an\naccessory rite.\n\n6:6:1:55\\. Now as regards that (cake) for Agni and Vish _n_ u, its mystic\nimport is the same as what is (implied) in a preparatory ceremony. And the\n(cake) on twelve potsherds for Vai _s_ vanara is for\n\np. 248\n\nthe obtainment of all the fires, Vai _s_ vanara being all the fires;--it is\none of twelve potsherds, for twelve months are a year, and Vai _s_ vanara is\nthe year.\n\n6:6:1:66\\. And, again, as to why he prepares one for Vai _s_ vanara,--it is\nbecause he is about to produce Agni as Vai _s_ vanara (belonging, or dear to,\nall men): in the initiation offering he first pours him forth as seed, and\nwhatlike the seed is that is poured into the womb, suchlike is (the child)\nborn therefrom; and inasmuch as he now pours forth that (Agni) Vai _s_ vanara\nas seed, therefore he is born hereafter as Vai _s_ vanara.\n\n6:6:1:77\\. And why he prepares those two (other) oblations,--Vai _s_ vanara is\nthe ruling power, and that \xc3\x82ditya pap is the people: he thus makes both the\nruling power and the people. The Vai _s_ vanara (cake) he prepares first, and\nhaving thereby made the ruling power, he makes the people.\n\n6:6:1:88\\. That (Vai _s_ vanara cake) is one single (oblation), having one\nsingle deity: he thus makes the ruling power to be concentrated in one\n(person), and excellence to be concentrated in one. The other, the pap, has\nmany deities, for the pap is a multiplicity of rite-grains, and those \xc3\x82dityas\nare a multiplicity of gods: he thus bestows multiplicity on the people. Thus\nmuch as to the deities.\n\n6:6:1:99\\. Now as regards the self (or body of Agni). The Vai _s_ vanara\n(cake) is the head, and that \xc3\x82ditya pap is the body: he thus makes both the\nhead and the body. The Vai _s_ vanara (cake) he prepares first; and having\nthereby made the head, he then makes the body.\n\n6:6:1:1010\\. That (Vai _s_ vanara cake) is one single (oblation), for the head\nis, as it were, one only; and the\n\np. 249\n\nother, the pap, has many deities, for that pap is a multiplicity of rice-\ngrains, and this body is a multiplicity of limbs: he thus bestows on the body\na multiplicity of limbs.\n\n6:6:1:1111\\. That (pap) is (prepared) on ghee, for the \xc3\x82dityas are consumers\nof ghee: he thus gratifies them, each by his own share, by his own liquor.\nThese offerings are (made) silently, for here in the sacrifice there is seed,\nand silently seed is infused.\n\n6:6:1:1212\\. He then offers the Audgrabha _n_ a (libations) 1, for by the\nAudgrabha _n_ as (elevatory libations) the gods raised themselves from this\nworld to the heavenly world: and inasmuch as (thereby) they raised themselves\n(ud-grabh), they are called 'audgrabha _n_ a;'--and in like manner does the\nSacrificer, by means of the Audgrabha _n_ as, now raise himself from this\nworld to the heavenly world.\n\n6:6:1:1313\\. There are many of these, in the building of the fire-altar as\nwell as at any other (special ceremony): the significance of this has been\ntold. They are of both kinds: (the significance) of this has been told;--first\nthose of the sacrifice, and then those of the fire: (the significance) of this\nalso has been told.\n\n6:6:1:1414\\. He offers five of the sacrifice 2,--the sacrifice is fivefold: as\ngreat as the sacrifice is, as great as is its measure, by so much he thus\npours it forth as seed. Seven (libations) of the fire,--the fire(-altar)\nconsists of seven layers 3; seven seasons are a year, and\n\np. 250\n\n[paragraph continues] Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is\nhis measure, by so much he thus pours him forth as seed. Those two kinds (of\nlibations) amount to twelve,--twelve months are a year, and Agni is the year:\nas great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.\n\n6:6:1:1515\\. He offers 1, with (Va _g_. S. XI, 66-67), 'The Purpose, Agni, the\nImpulse, hail!'--from purpose, indeed, this sacred rite originated at first,\nand he now impels (yokes, uses) it for this rite.\n\n6:6:1:1616\\. 'Mind, Wisdom, Agni, the Impulse, hail!'--from the mind indeed\nthis sacred rite originated at first, and he now impels it for this rite.\n\n6:6:1:1717\\. 'Thought, knowledge, Agni, the Impulse, hail!'--from thought,\nindeed, this sacred rite originated at first, and he now impels it for this\nrite.\n\n6:6:1:1818\\. 'The distinction of Speech, Agni, the Impulse, hail!'--from\nspeech, indeed, this sacred rite originated at first, and he now impels it for\nthis rite.\n\n6:6:1:1919\\. 'To Pra _g_ apati, to Manu, hail!'--Mann, forsooth, is Pra _g_\napati, for he thought out (man) all this (universe); and Pra _g_ apati,\nindeed, of old performed this rite, and he now makes use of him for this rite.\n\n6:6:1:2020\\. 'To Agni Vai _s_ vanara, hail!'--Agni Vai _s_ vanara, doubtless,\nis the year; and the year, indeed,\n\np. 251\n\nof old performed this rite; and he now makes use thereof for this rite.\n\n6:6:1:2121\\. He then offers the one to Savit _ri_ , for Savit _ri_ , indeed,\nof old performed this rite, and he now makes use of him for this rite,--(Va\n_g_. S. XI, 67; _Ri_ k S. V, 50, 1), 'Every mortal would choose the friendship\nof the divine Guide; every one craves riches, and would have glory for him to\nprosper, hail!' He who chooses the friendship of the god Savit _ri_ , chooses\nboth glory and prosperity; and he who performs this rite, indeed chooses his\nfriendship.\n\n6:6:1:2222\\. Now some offer these Audgrabha _n_ a libations into the fire-pan\nitself, saying, 'These, surely, are offered for (special) objects of desire,\nand that fire-pan is the Sacrificer's self: we thus secure for the\nSacrificer's self all his objects of desire.' Let him not do so; for the fire\nwhich is kindled (in the fire-pan) is the essence of the completed sacrifice\nand of those libations, and when he puts the fire-pan on the fire, after the\nsacrifice has been completed and the Audgrabha _n_ as offered, then the\nsacrifice mounts it (the pan), and it bears the sacrifice: let him, therefore,\nput the fire-pan on the fire only after the sacrifice is complete, and the\nAudgrabha _n_ as have been offered.\n\n6:6:1:2323\\. It is covered with a layer of Mu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ a grass, just for the\npurpose that it may blaze up. And as to why it is with a layer of Mu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ a\ngrass, (it is done) to avoid injury, for that Mu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ a grass is a womb,\nand the womb does not injure the child; for he who is born, is born from a\nwomb: 'May he (Agni), when he is born, be born from the womb,' thus he thinks.\n\np. 252\n\n6:6:1:2424\\. Inside 1 there is a layer of hemp, just for the purpose that it\nmay blaze up. And as to its being a layer of hemp,--the inner membrane\n(amnion) of the womb from which Pra _g_ apati was born consists of flax, and\nthe outer membrane (chorion) of hemp: hence the latter is foul-smelling, for\nit is the outer membrane of the embryo. [It is so used] to avoid injury, for\nthe outer membrane does not injure the embryo; and it is from the outer\nmembrane of the embryo that he who is born is born: 'May he (Agni), when he is\nborn, be born from the outer membrane of the embryo!' thus he thinks.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[246:1](sbe4145.htm#fr_483) Or rather, too many, more (than are required at\none of the normal Soma-sacrifices),--adhvarikebhyo bahutarani, Say.\n\n[246:2](sbe4145.htm#fr_484) That is, as would seem from Saya _n_ a, of such\nceremonies as have supernumerary, or additional, oblations to the normal ones\nconnected with them. This discussion seems to be introduced here on account of\nthe additional oblation (that to Vai _s_ vanara) offered at the initiation\nceremony. As an 'additional' or special, oblation at the Va _g_ apeya, Saya\n_n_ a refers to the pap of wild rice ([V, 1, 4, 12](sbe4106.htm#5:1:4:12));\nwhilst at the Ra _g_ asuya the one to Anumati ([V, 2, 3,\n4](sbe4110.htm#5:2:3:4)) is said to belong to the same category.\n\n[247:1](sbe4145.htm#fr_485) These and the subsequent offerings form part of\nthe Diksha, or initiation ceremony, for the Soma-sacrifice to be performed\nafter the completion of the fire-altar. This initiation ceremony commences on\nthe day of new moon, a week after the preparation of the ukha, or fire-pan. An\nintegral part of (the first day of) this ceremony is the kindling of a fire in\nthe ukha\\--the 'Ukhya Agni'--which ultimately serves to supply the fires for\nthe brick altars built on the completion of the period of initiation. The\nDiksha is, as a rule, to be performed daily for a year, during which time the\nfire has to be kept up in the ukha, and carried about by the Sacrificer for a\ntime each day. while the cake to Agni-Vish _n_ u here mentioned is the\nordinary cake-offering prescribed for the Diksha of the normal Soma-sacrifice\n(see III, 1, 3, 1), the Vai _s_ vanara cake is peculiar to the Agni _k_ ayana.\n\n[249:1](sbe4145.htm#fr_486) See III, 1, 4, 1.\n\n[249:2](sbe4145.htm#fr_487) Viz. the five Audgrabha _n_ a libations of the\nordinary Soma-sacrifice offered in the manner there described. See part ii, p.\n20, note.\n\n[249:3](sbe4145.htm#fr_488) Though Agni, or the fire-altar, is commonly called\nthe five-layered one (pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a _k_ itika), consisting as it does of five\ncomplete p. 250 layers of bricks, on the top of these there is a small\nadditional pile of two layers, the lower one (puna _s_ _k_ iti) in the form of\nthe Garhapatya hearth ([VII, 1, 1, 1](sbe4155.htm#7:1:1:1) seq.), and the\nupper one, consisting of two bricks, on which the fire is ultimately laid\ndown. See [p. 188](sbe4133.htm#page_188), note [4](sbe4133.htm#fn_389). Hence\nAgni is also called 'sapta _k_ itika.'\n\n[250:1](sbe4145.htm#fr_489) Viz. the seven special Audgrabha _n_ a libations\nof the Agni _k_ ayana.\n\n[252:1](sbe4145.htm#fr_490) That is, underneath the layer of mu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ a.\nBoth the reed-grass and the hemp are to be crushed and reduced to the\ncondition of powder previously to their being strewed into the fire-pan.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 6, 2.
