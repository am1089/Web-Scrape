He now throws loose soil (on the layer); for the loose soil means\nflesh: he thus covers him (Agni) with flesh. [He does so] after having laid\ndown the bricks;--the bricks are the bone: he thus covers the bone with flesh.\n\n8:7:3:22\\. He also strews it on (the place where lies) the naturally-\nperforated (brick), for the naturally-perforated one means vital air, and the\nloose soil\n\np. 139\n\nmeans food: he thus puts food into (the channels of) the vital air. In that\nmanner 1 he covers the whole body (of the altar); whence the food which is put\ninto (the channels of) the vital air benefits the whole body, extends over the\nwhole body.\n\n8:7:3:33\\. 'Let him not strew it on (the place of) the naturally-perforated\none,' say some, 'lest he should stop up (the channels of) the vital airs, for\nthe naturally-perforated one is the vital air.' Let him, nevertheless, strew\nit, for the vital airs are sustained by food, and whoever eats no food his\n(channels of the) vital airs grow up (and close): hence he for whom they act\nthus, comes to exist in yonder world even like a dry, hollow tube. Let him,\ntherefore, by all means strew (loose soil) on (the place of) the naturally-\nperforated one.\n\n8:7:3:44\\. Having strewed it on the svayamat _ri_ _n_ _n_ a (place) he goes on\ncovering (the altar) from the (brick) on the cross-spine up to the enclosing-\nstones. In the same way he goes on covering it from left to right behind the\nnaturally-perforated one up to the one on the cross-spine again.\n\n8:7:3:55\\. The body (of the altar) he covers first, for of (a bird) that is\nproduced, the body is the first to be produced; then the right wing, then the\ntail, then the left wing: that is in the rightward (sunwise) way, for this is\n(the way) with the gods.\n\n8:7:3:66\\. Now this loose soil, indeed, is the vital air; he therewith covers\nthe whole body: he thus puts vital air into the whole body. And, assuredly,\nwhatsoever member thereof he should not reach, that member of him (Agni) the\nvital air would not\n\np. 140\n\nreach; and whatever member the vital air does not reach that either dries up\nor withers away: let him, therefore, cover it entirely therewith.\n\n8:7:3:77\\. [He scatters the loose soil 1, with, Va _g_. S. XV, 56; _Ri_ g-veda\nI, 11, 1], 'They all have magnified Indra,'--for all beings, indeed, magnify\nIndra;--'the voices, him, of ocean-wide extent,'--he thereby alludes to his\ngreatness;--'the foremost of charioteers,'--for of charioteers he is the\ngreatest charioteer;--'the lordly lord of viands,'--viands mean food: thus,\n'the lordly lord of food.' With this anush _t_ ubh verse addressed to Indra he\nscatters it; for the loose soil belongs to Indra: that (layer of) loose soil\nis one half of Agni (the fire-altar), the (other) half is the collection of\nbricks.\n\n8:7:3:88\\. Here, now, they say, 'Whilst he lays down the bricks with all kinds\nof metres, and with (verses addressed to) all deities, he now scatters (the\nsoil) with a single (verse) addressed to a single deity,--how is this one half\nof Agni?' Indra, surely, is equal to all the gods; hence in that he scatters\nit with a (verse) addressed to Indra, this (soil) is one half of Agni. And as\nto its being (done) with an anush _t_ ubh verse,--the Anush _t_ ubh is speech,\nand all metres are speech: thereby also it is one half.\n\n8:7:3:99\\. He then lays down the Vikar _n_ i and Svayamat _ri_ _n_ _n_ a\n(bricks),--the Vikar _n_ i is Vayu (the wind), and the last naturally-\nperforated one is the sky: he thus sets up both the wind and the sky. He lays\nthem down as the last (highest), for wind and sky are the highest; and close\ntogether, for wind and\n\np. 141\n\nsky are close together. The Vikar _n_ i he lays down first: he thereby places\nthe wind on this side of the sky; whence that wind blows only on this side\n(thereof).\n\n8:7:3:1010\\. And, again, as to why he lays down the Vikar _n_ i. When, on that\n(former) occasion, they make the horse smell (the pile of bricks of) the\n(first) layer 1, then yonder sun strings these worlds to himself on a thread.\nNow that thread is the same as the wind; and that wind is the same as this\nVikar _n_ i: thus when he lays down the latter, then yonder sun strings to\nhimself these worlds on a thread.\n\n8:7:3:1111\\. And, again, as to why he lays down the Vikar _n_ i and the\nSvayamat _ri_ _n_ _n_ a; the Vikar _n_ i, doubtless, is vital power, and the\nnaturally-perforated one is vital air: he thus bestows both vital power and\nvital air. He lays them down as the two last (highest bricks), because vital\npower and vital air are the two highest (endowments); and close together,\nbecause vital power and vital air are closely (bound) together. The upper\n(northern) Vikar _n_ i he lays down first 2: he thereby encloses the vital air\non both sides in vital power.\n\n8:7:3:1212\\. [He lays it down, with, Va _g_. S. XV, 62; _Ri_ g-veda VII, 3,\n2], 'When, like a snorting steed, that longeth for the pasture, he started\nforth from the great enclosure, then the wind fanned his flame, and black then\nwas thy path;'--for when the wind fans his (Agni's) flame,\n\np. 142\n\nthen his path does become black. With a trish _t_ ubh verse he lays it down,\nbecause Vayu (the wind) is of trish _t_ ubh nature; with one relating to Agni,\nbecause it is Agni's performance; with an undefined one, because Vayu is\nundefined. And as to his saying 'the wind,' Vayu indeed is the wind.\n\n8:7:3:1313\\. He then lays down the Svayamat _ri_ _n_ _n_ a, with (Va _g_. S.\nXV, 63), 'I seat thee in the seat of the vital power,'--the vital power,\ndoubtless, is yonder (sun), and his seat this is;--'the animating,'--for he\n(the sun) animates all this universe;--'in the shadow,'--for in his shadow all\nthis universe is;--'in the heart of the sea,'--for this, indeed, is the heart\nof the (aerial) sea 1;--'the radiant, the luminous,'--for radiant and luminous\nis the sky;--'thou that illumines the sky, the earth and the wide air;'--for\nthus, indeed, does he (the sun) illumine these worlds.\n\n8:7:3:1414\\. 'May Paramesh _th_ in settle thee,'--for Paramesh _th_ in saw\nthis fifth layer 2.\n\n8:7:3:1515\\. And, again, as to why he lays it down by means of Paramesh _th_\nin. When Pra _g_ apati had become disjointed, the deities took him and went\noff in different directions. Paramesh _th_ in took his head, and kept going\naway from him.\n\n8:7:3:1616\\. He spake to him, 'Come to me and restore unto me that wherewith\nthou hast gone from me!'--'What will therefrom accrue to me?'--'That part of\nmy body shall be sacred to thee!'--'So be it!' So Paramesh _th_ in restored\nthat to him.\n\n8:7:3:1717\\. Now that last self-perforated (brick) is just\n\np. 143\n\nthat part of him (Pra _g_ apati-Agni); and when he now lays it down in this\nplace, he thereby restores to him what part of his body this is: that is why\nhe lays it down in this place.\n\n8:7:3:1818\\. 'On the back of the sky, thee, the wide and broad one!'--for this\n(top of the altar) is indeed the back of the sky, and it is both wide and\nbroad 1;--'Sustain thou the sky! make firm the sky! injure not the sky!'--that\nis, 'Sustain thy self, make firm thy self, injure not thy self (body)!'\n\n8:7:3:1919\\. 'For all out-breathing, off-breathing, through-breathing, up-\nbreathing!'--the naturally-perforated (brick) is the vital air, and the vital\nair truly serves for everything here;--'for a resting-place, for a moving-\nplace!'--the naturally-perforated (bricks) are these worlds, and these worlds\nare the resting-place and the moving-place;--'May Surya guard thee,'--that is,\n'May Surya protect thee,'--'with mighty well-being,'--that is, 'with great\nwell-being;'--'with the safest roof!'--that is, 'with whatever roof (abode) is\nthe safest.'\n\n8:7:3:2020\\. Separately he lays them down, for separate are wind and sky; and\nonce only he 'settles' them: he thereby makes them the same, for vital power\nand vital air are the same. They are both of them stones and both of them\nnaturally-perforated; for vital power and vital air are the same. He then\npronounces the Sudadohas over them,--the Sudadohas means vital air; he thus\nmakes them\n\np. 144\n\ncontinuous, joins them together by means of the vital air.\n\n8:7:3:2121\\. 'Those his well-like milking ones 1'--a well (suda) means water,\nand milking means food;--'the speckled ones mix the Soma,'--the speckled (cow)\nmeans food;--'at the birth of the gods,'--the birth of the gods is the\nyear;--'the tribes,' the tribes (vi _s_ ), doubtless, are the sacrifice, for\nall beings are ranged (vish _t_ a) 2 under the sacrifice;--'in the three\nspheres of the heavens,'--the three spheres of the heavens, doubtless, are the\n(three) pressings (of Soma): he thus means the pressings. With an anush _t_\nubh verse (he performs this rite), for the Anush _t_ ubh is speech, and speech\n(includes) all vital airs; and by means of speech, that is vital air, he thus\nmakes these two (bricks) continuous, and joins them together. This same\nSudadohas, whilst being a single (verse), extends over all the bricks, whence\n--the Sudadohas being the vital air--this vital air, whilst being one only,\nextends over all the limbs, over the whole body.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[139:1](sbe4328.htm#fr_247) Or, therewith (with loose soil).\n\n[140:1](sbe4328.htm#fr_248) Taking it from the edge of the _K_ atvala or pit,\ncf.
