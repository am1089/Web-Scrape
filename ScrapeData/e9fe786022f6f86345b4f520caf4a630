Prayer for heaven after remission of sins.\n\n1\\. If air, or earth and heaven, if mother or father, we have injured, may\nthis Agni Garhapatya (household fire) without fail lead us out from this\n(crime)  \nto the world of well-doing!  \n2\\. The earth is our mother, Aditi (the universe) our kin, the air our\nprotector from hostile schemes. May father sky bring prosperity to us from the\nworld of the Fathers; may I come to my (departed) kin, and not lose heaven!  \n3\\. In that bright world where our pious friends live in joy, having cast\naside the ailments of their own bodies, free from lameness, not deformed in\nlimb, there may we behold our parents and our children!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 27.
