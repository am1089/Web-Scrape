IV.\n\nContinuation of the account of the first kind of dissolution. Of the second\nkind, or elemental dissolution; of all being resolved into primary spirit.\n\nWHEN the waters have reached the region of the seven Rishis, and the whole of\nthe three worlds is one ocean, they stop. The breath of Vishn\xcc\x81u becomes a\nstrong wind, which blows for more than a hundred years, until all the clouds\nare dispersed. The wind is then reabsorbed, and he of whom all things are\nmade, the lord by whom all things exist, he who is inconceivable, without\nbeginning of the universe, reposes, sleeping upon \xc5\x9aesha, in the midst of the\ndeep. The creator, Hari, sleeps upon the ocean, in the form of\nBrahma\\--glorified by Sanaka And the saints who had gone to the Janaloka, and\ncontemplated by the holy inhabitants of Brahmaloka, anxious for final\nliberation--involved in mystic slumber, the celestial personification of his\nown illusions, and meditating on his own ineffable spirit, which is called\nVasudeva. This, Maitreya, is the dissolution termed incidental, because Hari,\nin the form of Brahma, sleeps there, as its incidental cause.\n\nWhen the universal spirit wakes, the world revives; when he closes his eyes,\nall things fall upon the bed of mystic slumber. In like manner as a thousand\ngreat ages constitute a day of Brahma, so his night consists of the same\nperiod; during which the world is submerged by a vast ocean. Awaking at the\nend of his night, the unborn, Vishn\xcc\x81u, in the character of Brahma, creates the\nuniverse anew, in the manner formerly related to you 1.\n\nI have thus described to you the intermediate dissolution of the world,\noccurring at the end of every Kalpa. I will now, Maitreya, describe to you\nelemental dissolution. When by dearth and fire all the worlds and Patalas are\nwithered up, and the modifications of Mahat and other products of nature are\nby the will of Krishn\xcc\x81a destroyed, the progress of\n\np. 635\n\nelemental dissolution is begun. Then, first, the waters swallow up the\nproperty of earth, which is the rudiment of smell; and earth, deprived of its\nproperty, proceeds to destruction. Devoid of the rudiment of odour, the earth\nbecomes one with water. The waters then being much augmented, roaring, and\nrushing along, fill up all space, whether agitated or still. When the universe\nis thus pervaded by the waves of the watery element, its rudimental flavour is\nlicked up by the element of fire, and, in consequence of the destruction of\ntheir rudiments, the waters themselves are destroyed. Deprived of the\nessential rudiment of flavour, they become one with fire, and the universe is\ntherefore entirely filled with flame, which drinks up the water on every side,\nand gradually overspreads the whole of the world. While space is enveloped in\nflame, above, below, and all around, the element of wind seizes upon the\nrudimental property, or form, which is the cause of light; and that being\nwithdrawn, all becomes of the nature of air. The rudiment of form being\ndestroyed, and fire deprived of its rudiment, air extinguishes fire, and\nspreads resistlessly over space, which is deprived of light when fire merges\ninto air. Air then, accompanied by sound, which is the source of ether,\nextends every where throughout the ten regions of space, until ether seizes\nupon contact, its rudimental property; by the loss of which, air is destroyed,\nand ether remains unmodified: devoid of form, flavour, touch, and smell, it\nexists unembodied and vast, and pervades the whole of space. Ether, whose\ncharacteristic property and rudiment is sound, exists alone, occupying all the\nvacuity of space. But then the radical element egotism devours sound, and all\nthe elements and faculties are at once merged into their original. This\nprimary element is consciousness, combined with the property of darkness, and\nis itself swallowed up by Mahat, whose characteristic property is\nintelligence; and earth and Mahat are the inner and outer boundaries of the\nuniverse. In this manner, as in the creation were the seven forms of nature\n(Prakriti), reckoned from Mahat to earth 2, so, at the time of elemental\ndissolution, these seven successively reenter into each other. The egg of\nBrahma is\n\np. 636\n\ndissolved in the waters that surround it, with its seven zones, seven oceans,\nseven regions, and their mountains. The investure of water is drunk up by\nfire: the stratum of fire is absorbed by that of air: air blends itself with\nether: the primary element of egotism devours the ether, and is itself taken\nup by intellect, which, along with all these, is seized upon by nature\n(Prakriti). Equilibrium of the three properties, without excess or deficiency,\nis called nature (Prakriti), origin (Hetu), the chief principle (Pradhan\xcc\x81a),\ncause (Karan\xcc\x81a), supreme (Param). This Prakriti is essentially the same,\nwhether discrete or indiscrete; only that which is discrete is finally lost or\nabsorbed in the indiscrete. Spirit also, which is one, pure, imperishable,\neternal, all-pervading, is a portion of that supreme spirit which is all\nthings. That spirit which is other than (embodied) spirit, in which there are\nno attributes of name, species, or the like--which is one with all wisdom, and\nis to be understood as sole existence--that is Brahma, infinite glory, supreme\nspirit, supreme power, Vishn\xcc\x81u, all that is; from whence the perfect sage\nreturns no more. Nature (Prakriti), which I have described to you as being\nessentially both discrete and indiscrete, and spirit (which is united with\nbody), both resolve into supreme spirit. Supreme spirit is the upholder of all\nthings, and the ruler of all things, and is glorified in the Vedas and in the\nVedanta by the name of Vishn\xcc\x81u.\n\nWorks, as enjoined by the Vedas, are of two kinds, active (Pravritta) and\nquiescent (Nivritta); by both of which the universal person is worshipped by\nmankind. He, the lord of sacrifice, the male of sacrifice, the most excellent\nmale, is worshipped by men in the active mode by rites enjoined in the Rik,\nYajur, and Sama Vedas. The soul of wisdom, the person of wisdom, Vishn\xcc\x81u, the\ngiver of emancipation, is worshipped by sages in the quiescent form, through\nmeditative devotion. The exhaustless Vishn\xcc\x81u is whatever thing that is\ndesignated by long, short, or prolated syllables, or that which is without a\nname. He is that which is discrete, and that which is indiscrete: he is\nexhaustless spirit, supreme spirit, universal spirit, Hari, the wearer of\nuniversal forms. Nature, whether discrete or indiscrete, is absorbed into him,\nand (detached) spirit also merges into the all-diffusive and unobstructed\nspirit.\n\np. 637\n\n[paragraph continues] The period of two Pararddhas, as I have described it to\nyou, Maitreya, is called a day of that potent Vishn\xcc\x81u; and whilst the products\nof nature are merged into their source, nature into spirit, and that into the\nsupreme, that period is termed his night, and is of equal duration with his\nday. But, in fact, to that eternal supreme spirit there is neither day nor\nnight, and these distinctions are only figuratively applied to the almighty. I\nhave thus explained to you the nature of elemental dissolution, and will now\nexpound to you which is final 3.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[634:1](vp159.htm#fr_1619) The Naimittika Pralaya is described in the Vayu,\nBhagavata, Kurma, and other Puran\xcc\x81as, to the same effect, and very commonly in\nprecisely the same words.\n\n[635:2](vp159.htm#fr_1620) See [p. 14](vp036.htm#page_14).\n\n[637:3](vp159.htm#fr_1621) The Bhagavata notices the Prakrita pralaya much\nmore briefly, and it is omitted in the Vayu.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter V](vp160.htm)\n\n'
