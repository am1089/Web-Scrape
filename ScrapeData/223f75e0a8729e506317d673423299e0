MAX M\xc3\x9cLLER  \nWHO HAS DEVOTED HIS LIFETIME TO THE ELUCIDATION OF  \nTHE LEARNING, LITERATURE, AND RELIGION OF  \nANCIENT INDIA  \nAND HAS RECOGNISED AND VINDICATED WHAT IS  \nTRUE AND GREAT AND ENNOBLING IN  \nMODERN INDIA  \nTHIS TRANSLATION OF THE RAMAYANA  \nIS DEDICATED AS A  \nSINCERE TOREN OF THE ESTEEM AND REGARD OF MY  \nCOUNTRYMEN\n\n# A NOTE ON  \nTHE LATE ROMESH C. DUTT\n\nROMESH CHUNDER DUTT, to whom English readers are indebted for the condensed\nmetrical version of the ancient Indian epics given in this volume, was one of\nthe most distinguished sons of modern India. He came of a Hindu family\nstanding high among the Kayasths, second of the great castes in Bengal, was\nborn in 1848, and grew to manhood amid influences of deep spiritual\ndisturbance. In those days an Indian youth who had felt the call of the West\nencountered the sternest opposition from both his own family and the\ncommunity, if hie avowed his ambition of making the voyage to Europe. Rornesh\nDutt, having passed through the Presidency College, Calcutta, took his fate\ninto his own hands. Accompanied by two friends, both of whom after wards rose\nto eminence in Bengal, he secretly took ship, came to London, entered for the\nIndian Civil Service, and took third place in the open examination of 1869. He\nwas the first of his race to attain the rank of divisional commissioner, and\nlong before his retirement in 1897, at the end of twenty-five years\' service,\nhad made a high reputation as an administrator. He sat for a time in the\nBengal Legislative Council, and, in recognition of his official work, received\nthe Companionship of the Indian Empire. He died on November 30, 1909, at\nBaroda, the capital of the important Native State which he had served with\nbrilliant success as revenue minister and dewan.\n\nThe influences which determined his literary activity were primarily European.\nAs a student in Calcutta he had made acquaintance with the English classics,\nand later, while at University College, had read the poets insatiably.\nNevertheless his first successes were achieved in his mother tongue. He wrote\nin Bengali poems and plays, historical and social novels, and aroused a storm\nof protest within the orthodox community of his Province by publishing a\nBengali translation of the Rig Veda. In English, of which he had complete\nmastery, his first complete essay was a history of civilisation in Ancient\nIndia, which, though not a work of original research, fulfilled a useful\npurpose in its day. When freedom from Government service gave him the\nopportunity he set himself to writing the _Economic History of India_ and\n_India in the Victorian Age_ , the two together forming, his chief\ncontribution to the subject which he, more than any other Indian of his time,\nhad made his own. In these books, as in others of kindred theme and purpose,\nthere is much criticism of British administration, strongly felt if\ntemperately expressed. Apart from this, its more controversial side, the work\nof Romesh Dutt is valuable mainly in that it has helped to reveal to his own\npeople no less than to ours, the spiritual riches of ancient India.\n\nS.
