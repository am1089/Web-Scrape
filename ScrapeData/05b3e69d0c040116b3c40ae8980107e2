Now, therefore, the _K_ andraya _n_ a (or lunar penance will be\ndescribed).\n\n2\\. The (general) rules prescribed for a K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra (are applicable)\nto that. 2\n\n3\\. (The hair must be) shaved, in case it (is performed as) a penance. 3\n\n4\\. He shall fast on the day preceding the full moon.\n\n5\\. And (he shall offer) libations (of water), oblations of clarified butter,\nconsecrate the sacrificial viands, and worship the moon, reciting these ( _ri_\n_k_ as), \'Increase\' (Rig-veda I, 91, 17), \'May milk be joined with thee\' (Rig-\nveda I, 91, 18, and) \'Ever new\' (Rig-veda X, 85, 19). 5\n\n6\\. He shall offer (clarified butter), reciting the four ( _ri_ _k_ as\nbeginning) \'Yad deva devahe _d_ anam,\' 6\n\n7\\. And at the end (of the offering of clarified 7\n\np. 301\n\nbutter he shall offer) pieces of sacred fuel, reciting (the texts beginning)\n\'Devak _ri_ tasya.\'\n\n8\\. Each mouthful of food must be consecrated by the mental recitations (of\none) of the following (words): Om, bhu _h_ , bhuva _h_ , sva _h_ , austerity,\ntruth, fame, prosperity, vigour, refreshment, strength, lustre, soul, law,\nSiva. 8\n\n9\\. Or (he may consecrate) all (of them at once, saying), Adoration svaha. 9\n\n10\\. The size of a mouthful (shall be such) as not to cause a distortion of\nthe mouth (in swallowing it). 10\n\n11\\. The sacrificial viands are, boiled rice, food obtained by begging, ground\nbarley, grain separated from the husk, barley-gruel, vegetables, milk, sour 11\n\np. 302\n\nmilk, clarified butter, roots, fruits, and water; (among these) each\nsucceeding one is preferable (to those enumerated earlier).\n\n12\\. He shall eat on the day of the full moon fifteen mouthfuls, and during\nthe dark half (of the month) daily diminish his portion by one (mouthful). 12\n\n13\\. He shall fast on the day of the new moon, and during the bright half (of\nthe month) daily increase (his portion) by one (mouthful).\n\n14\\. According to some (the order shall be) inverted. 14\n\n15\\. That (is called) a month, occupied by the _K_ andraya _n_ a penance.\n\n16\\. He who has completed that, becomes free from sin and free from crime, and\ndestroys all guilt.\n\n17\\. He who has completed a second (month, living according to that rule),\nsanctifies himself, ten ancestors, and ten descendants, as well as (any)\ncompany (to which he may be invited);\n\n18\\. And he who has lived for a year (according to that rule), dwells (after\ndeath) in the world of the moon. 18\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[300:2](sbe0291.htm#fr_1471) **XXVII**. The rules meant particularly are those\ngiven XXVI, 6-11.\n\n[300:3](sbe0291.htm#fr_1472) \'He calls penance vrata.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[300:5](sbe0291.htm#fr_1473) The four religious acts, the first of which is\nthe offering of libations, are to be performed with the help of the three\nsacred texts, the first of which begins "Increase." As the number (of the acts\nand of the verses) does not agree, the fire-oblations and the libations of\nwater must be performed severally, each with one text, and the consecration\n(of the offerings) and the worship (of the moon must be performed with all of\nthem) together.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[300:6](sbe0291.htm#fr_1474) \'He shall offer--as nothing is specified--\nclarified butter, with the first four _ri_ _k_ as of the Anuvaka \'Yad deva\ndevahe _d_ anam.\' Counting the three mentioned above (Sutra 5), altogether\nseven oblations of clarified butter must be made.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[300:7](sbe0291.htm#fr_1475) \'On completion of the oblations of clarified\nbutter, he p. 301 shall offer pieces of sacred fuel, reciting the eight sacred\ntexts, which begin "Devak _ri_ tasya," and have been mentioned above (XXV,\n10). The word "completion" (anta) is merely a confirmation of something\nestablished, because (the place of the offering) is already fixed by the place\nof the rule. But others explain the word "ante" to mean "at the end of the _K_\nandraya _n_ a." The word "and" does not agree with their (opinion).\'--\nHaradatta.\n\n[301:8](sbe0291.htm#fr_1476) Haradatta observes that on the days when the\nperformer eats less than fifteen mouthfuls, the later mentioned texts must be\nleft out, and that, while eating, the performer must employ the Pra _n_ ahuti\nMantras (\xc3\x82pastamba II, 1, 1, 2 note). He concludes by giving the following\nprayoga for the performance of the ceremony: He places all the food in his\ndish, and consecrates it by the texts "Increase," &c. Next he divides it into\nmouthfuls, and consecrates each successively with the word Om and the rest,\nand eats them, reciting the texts for the Pra _n_ ahutis.\'\n\n[301:9](sbe0291.htm#fr_1477) Haradatta states that either of the two words may\nbe used in consecrating all the mouthfuls, but that others think, both should\nbe used.\n\n[301:10](sbe0291.htm#fr_1478) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 324.\n\n[301:11](sbe0291.htm#fr_1479) The term \'sacrificial viands\' denotes here,\naccording to Haradatta, the food eaten by the performer, which, like that\neaten by the performer of a K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra, must be havishya, \'fit for an\noffering,\' p. 302 see above, XXVI, 2. Haradatta adds that, as a G _ri_ hastha\nmust not beg, the food obtained by begging must have been collected by his\npupils, and that liquid food must be used for the expiation of the more\nserious offences.\n\n[302:12](sbe0291.htm#fr_1480) Manu XI, 2,7-218; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III,\n324-325.\n\n[302:14](sbe0291.htm#fr_1481) I.e. the performer may begin with the fast on\nthe day of the new moon.\n\n[302:18](sbe0291.htm#fr_1482) Manu XI, 221; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 327.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXVIII](sbe0292.htm)\n\n'
