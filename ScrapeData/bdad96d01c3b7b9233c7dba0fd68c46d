The udgitha is the pra _n_ ava 1, the pra _n_ ava is the udgitha. And as\nthe udgitha is the sun 2, So is the pra _n_ ava, for he (the sun) goes\nsounding Om.\n\n2\\. 'Him I sang praises to, therefore art thou my only one,' thus said\nKaushitaki to his son. 'Do thou revolve his rays, then thou wilt have many\nsons.' So much in reference to the Devas.\n\n3\\. Now with reference to the body. Let a man meditate on the udgitha as the\nbreath (in the mouth), for he goes sounding Om 3.\n\n4\\. 'Him I sang praises to, therefore art thou my only son,' thus said\nKaushitaki to his son. 'Do thou therefore sing praises to the breath as\nmanifold, if thou wishest to have many sons.'\n\n5\\. He who knows that the udgitha is the pra _n_ ava, and the pra _n_ ava the\nudgitha, rectifies from the seat of the Hot _ri_ priest any mistake committed\nby the Udgat _ri_ priest in performing the udgitha, yea, in performing the\nudgitha.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[12:1](sbe01026.htm#fr_93) Pranava is the name used chiefly by the followers\nof the Rig-veda, udgitha the name used by the followers of the Sama-veda. Both\nwords are intended for the syllable Om.\n\n[12:2](sbe01026.htm#fr_94) Cf. _Kh_. Up. I, 3, 1.\n\n[12:3](sbe01026.htm#fr_95) The breath in the mouth, or the chief breath, says\nOm, i. e. gives permission to the five senses to act, just as the sun, by\nsaying Om, gives permission to all living beings to move about.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 6](sbe01027.htm)\n\n"
