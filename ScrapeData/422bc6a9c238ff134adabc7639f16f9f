She is so absurdly childish!\n\nShe does not know the difference between the lights in the streets and the\nstars.\n\nWhen we play at eating with pebbles, she thinks they are real food, and tries\nto put them into her mouth.\n\nWhen I open a book before her and ask her to learn her a, b, c, she tears the\nleaves with her hands and roars for joy at nothing; this is your baby\'s way of\ndoing her lesson.\n\nWhen I shake my head at her in anger and scold her and call her naughty, she\nlaughs and thinks it great fun.\n\nEverybody knows that father is away, but if in play I call aloud "Father," she\nlooks about her in excitement and thinks that father is near.\n\nWhen I hold my class with the donkeys that our washerman brings to carry away\nthe clothes and I warn her that I am the schoolmaster, she will scream for no\nreason and call me dada. [ _elder brother_ ]\n\nYour baby wants to catch the moon. She is so funny; she calls Ganesh Ganush. [\n_Ganesh, a common name in India, also that of the god with the elephant\'s\nhead._ ]\n\nMother, your baby is silly, she is so absurdly childish!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Little Big Man](cm29.htm)\n\n'
