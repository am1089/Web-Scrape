That (lump of clay representing Agni) is still in his hand when he\naddresses the animals; for the gods, being about to equip 1 (Agni), now first\nlaid vigour into them; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer, or priest)\nnow, being about to equip (Agni), first lay vigour into these (cattle).\n\n6:4:4:22\\. He addresses the horse, with (Va _g_. S. XI, 43 _Ri_ k S. X, 1, 2),\n'Thus born, art thou the child of the two worlds;'--the two worlds, doubtless,\nare these two, heaven and earth; and he (Agni) thus born, is the child of\nthese two;--'O Agni, the lovely (child), distributed among the plants,'--for\nhe, the lovely one, is indeed distributed among all the plants 2;--'a\nbrilliant child, through gloom and night,'--for as a brilliant child, he\n(Agni) indeed shines beyond gloom and night;--'crying aloud thou didst go\nforth from the mothers;'--his mothers, doubtless, are the plants, and from\nthem he comes forth crying aloud. He thereby lays vigour into the horse.\n\n6:4:4:33\\. Then (he addresses) the ass, with (Va _g_. S. XI, 44), 'Steadfast\nbe thou, firm-limbed, and a swift racer be thou, O steed!'--that is, 'be thou\nsteadfast, and firm-limbed, and swift, and a racer, O steed!'--'Ample be thou,\nand well to sit upon, thou, the bearer of Agni's supply!'--that is, 'be\n\np. 225\n\nthou ample (broad), well to rest upon, thou, Agni's provender-bearer 1!' He\nthereby lays vigour into the ass.\n\n6:4:4:44\\. Then the he-goat, with (Va _g_. S. XI, 45), 'Be thou propitious\nunto human creatures, O A\xe1\xb9\x85giras!'--for Agni is A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, and the he-goat is\nsacred to Agni: he thus appeases him with a view to his doing no\ninjury;--'Scorch not heaven and earth, nor the air, nor the trees!'--that is,\n'do not injure anything!' He thereby lays vigour into the he-goat.\n\n6:4:4:55\\. With three (verses) he addresses (the animals), for threefold is\nAgni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus\nlays vigour into them.\n\n6:4:4:66\\. He then holds it (Agni, the lump of clay) over these animals,\nwhereby he equips him (Agni) with these cattle. He does not touch them, lest\nhe should injure that seed by the thunderbolt, for cattle are a thunderbolt,\nand this (clay) is seed; or lest that Agni should injure those cattle, for\nthat (lump of clay) is Agni, and these (animals) are cattle.\n\n6:4:4:77\\. In the first place he holds it over the horse, with (Va _g_. S. XI,\n46), 'Let the racer start forth neighing lustily,'--that is, 'Let the racer\nstart forth neighing repeatedly;'--'the running ass, crying aloud!' He thus\nmentions the ass in the formula of the horse, and thereby imbues the ass with\nsorrow 2;--'bearing Agni Purishya, may he\n\np. 226\n\nnot perish before his full measure of time!'--that is, 'bearing Agni\nfavourable to cattle, may he (the horse) not perish before (the completion of)\nthis sacred work.' He thereby equips him (Agni) with the horse.\n\n6:4:4:88\\. Then (over) the ass, with, 'The male carrying Agni, the male,'--for\nAgni is a male, and the he-ass is a male: that male carries the male;--'the\nsea-born child of the waters,'--for he (Agni) is the sea-born child of the\nwaters. He thereby equips him with the ass.\n\n6:4:4:99\\. He then takes it off, with, 'O Agni, come hither to the feast!'--\nthat is, 'in order to rejoice.' By means of the brahman, the ya _g_ us\n(formula), he thus removes him (Agni) from the _S_ udra caste.\n\n6:4:4:1010\\. Then (he holds it over) the he-goat, with (Va _g_. S XI, 47),\n'The law--the truth, the law--the truth!'\\--the (divine) law doubtless is this\nAgni; and the truth is yonder sun; or, rather, the law is yonder (sun), and\nthe truth is this (Agni); but, indeed, this Agni is both the one and the\nother: hence he says, 'the law--the truth, the law--the truth.' He thereby\nequips him with the he-goat\n\n6:4:4:1111\\. With three (beasts) he equips (Agni),--three fold is Agni: as\ngreat as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus equips him.\nWith three (verses) he previously addresses (the beasts),--that mikes six: the\nsignificance of this (number) has been explained.\n\n6:4:4:1212\\. They then make the beasts return (to the \xc3\x82havaniya): the he-goat\ngoes first of them, then the ass, then the horse. Now, in going away from this\n\np. 227\n\n[paragraph continues] (\xc3\x82havaniya 1), the horse goes first, then the ass, then\nthe he-goat,--for the horse corresponds to the Kshatra (nobility), the ass to\nthe Vai _s_ ya and _S_ udra, the he-goat to the Brahma _n_ a.\n\n6:4:4:1313\\. And inasmuch as, in going from here, the horse goes first,\ntherefore the Kshatriya, going first, is followed by the three other castes;\nand inasmuch as, in returning from there, the he-goat goes first, therefore\nthe Brahma _n_ a, going first, is followed by the three other castes. And\ninasmuch as the ass does not go first, either in going from here, or in coming\nback from there, therefore the Brahma _n_ a and Kshatriya never go behind the\nVai _s_ ya and _S_ udra hence they walk thus in order to avoid a confusion\nbetween good and bad. And, moreover, he thus encloses those two castes (the\nVai _s_ ya and _S_ udra) on both sides by the priesthood and the nobility, and\nmakes them submissive.\n\n6:4:4:1414\\. He then looks at the sham-man, with, 'Agni Purishya we bear,\nA\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like;'--that is, 'Agni, favourable to cattle, we bear, like Agni.' He\nthereby equips him with the sham-man.\n\n6:4:4:1515\\. He (the Adhvaryu) arrives (near the fire) while holding (the lump\nof clay) over the he-goat; for the he-goat is sacred to Agni: he thus equips\nhim (Agni) with his own self, with his own godhead. And, moreover, the he-goat\nis the Brahman (priesthood): with the Brahman he thus equips him.\n\n6:4:4:1616\\. He then takes it down, with, 'O plants, welcome ye with joy this\npropitious Agni coming hitherwards!' for the plants are afraid lest he (Agni)\nshould injure them: it is for them that he\n\np. 228\n\nnow appeases him, saying, 'Welcome ye him with joy, propitious he comes to\nyou; he will not injure you!'--'Removing all infirmities, afflictions;\nsettling down, drive off from us evil intention!' that is, 'removing all\ninfirmities and afflictions, settling down, drive off from us all evil!'\n\n6:4:4:1717\\. [Va _g_. S. XI, 48] 'O plants, receive him joyfully, ye\nblossoming, full-berried ones!' for that is their perfect form when they are\nblossoming and full-berried: thus, 'Being perfect, receive ye him\njoyfully!'--'this timely child of yours hath settled down in his old seat;'\nthat is, 'this seasonable child of yours has settled down in his eternal\nseat.'\n\n6:4:4:1818\\. With two (verses) he takes it down,--two-footed is the\nSacrificer, and the Sacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is\nhis measure, with so much he thus takes it down. He takes it down from the\nright (south) to the left (north) side: the significance of this has been\nexplained. Raised and sprinkled is (the place) where he takes it down, for on\na (mound), raised and sprinkled, the (sacrificial) fire is laid down. Gravel\nis strewed thereon: the significance of this (will be explained) hereafter 1.\n\n6:4:4:1919\\. It is enclosed on all sides 2; for at that time the gods were\nafraid, thinking, 'We hope the Rakshas, the fiends, will not smite here this\n(Agni) of ours!' They enclosed him with this stronghold; and in like manner\ndoes this one now enclose him with this stronghold. And, again, this is a\nwomb;\n\np. 229\n\nand this (clay) is seed; and in secret, as it were, the seed is infused into\nthe womb: it is thus made of the form of the womb; and hence it is only in\nsecret that one would have intercourse even with his own wife.\n\n6:4:4:2020\\. He then unties it (the lump of clay): whatever part of his (body)\npains him (Agni) when tied up, that pain he now puts outside of him; and,\nmoreover, he causes him to be born from that womb (the antelope skin).\n\n6:4:4:2121\\. [He unties it, with Va _g_. S. XI, 49; _Ri_ k S. III, 15, 1]\n'Blazing forth with wide glare,'--that is, 'Shining brightly with wide\nglare;'--'chase away the terrors of the hating demons!'--that is, 'chase away\nall evils!'--'May I be in the protection of the great, the good protector, in\nthe guidance of Agni, ready to our call!' thereby he invokes a blessing.\n\n6:4:4:2222\\. He then cuts off some goat's hair, and lets loose the animals\ntowards the north-east; for this, the north-east, is the region of both gods\nand men: he thus bestows cattle on that region, and hence both gods and men\nsubsist on cattle.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[224:1](sbe4140.htm#fr_454) For the ceremony of 'equipping' Agni, see part i,\np. 276, note 1.\n\n[224:2](sbe4140.htm#fr_455) Viz. inasmuch as fire may be elicited from dry\nwood. See also I, 6, 4, 5, where Soma, frequently identified with Agni (see\n[VI, 5, 1, 1](sbe4141.htm#6:5:1:1)), is said at new moon to come down to the\nearth, and enter the waters and plants in order to be born anew from them.\n\n[225:1](sbe4140.htm#fr_456) Literally, Agni's bearer of what is suitable for\nthe cattle, or perhaps, be thou, for Agni, the bearer of (himself) favourable\nto cattle;--'pa _s_ avya' being here as elsewhere used (see [p.\n201](sbe4134.htm#page_201), note *[1](sbe4134.htm#fn_415)*) to explain\n'purisha,' that which fills, the mould or soil used as mortar for the layers\nof bricks, in building up the fire-altar.\n\n[225:2](sbe4140.htm#fr_457) On account of his being compared with the horse,\nSay. The author probably alludes to the dejected, spiritless look of the ass,\nas p. 226 compared with that of the horse. The word ' _s_ u _k_ ' might,\nhowever, perhaps also be taken in the sense of 'fervour, fire.'\n\n[227:1](sbe4140.htm#fr_458) See [VI, 3, 2, 6](sbe4135.htm#6:3:2:6) seq.\n\n[228:1](sbe4140.htm#fr_459) See [VII, 1, 1, 9](sbe4155.htm#7:1:1:9).\n\n[228:2](sbe4140.htm#fr_460) The lump of clay is deposited on a raised mound\n(or perhaps rather on a cut-out piece of ground, uddhata), in an enclosed\nshed, (with a door on the east side) north of the \xc3\x82havaniya.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 5, 1.
