Manu IV, 2 12.\n\n[61:4](sbe0220.htm#fr_378) Manu IV, 212; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 167.\n\n[62:5](sbe0220.htm#fr_379) \'As the text has avaghrata, "smelt at," it does not\nmatter if they smell the food from a distance.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[62:11](sbe0220.htm#fr_380) \'It must be understood from other Sm _ri_ tis,\nthat brass is to be cleaned with ashes, copper with acids, silver with\ncowdung, and gold with water.\'--Haradatta. Manu V, I 14.\n\n[62:12](sbe0220.htm#fr_381) Manu V, 115.\n\n[62:16](sbe0220.htm#fr_382) \'Having sprinkled them with water and purified\nthem by boiling; or, according to others, mixing them with so much water as\nwill not spoil them.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[62:17](sbe0220.htm#fr_383) The Sanskrit has two terms for \'eating;\' the first\n\'khad\' p. 63 applies to hard substances, the second \'ad\' to soft substances.\nManu I, V, 211; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 16 7.\n\n[63:18](sbe0220.htm#fr_384) Manu IV, 211; V, 9; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 167.\n\n[63:19](sbe0220.htm#fr_385) Manu V, 10, 24 and 25.\n\n[63:20](sbe0220.htm#fr_386) According to Haradatta, \xc3\x82pastamba returns once\nmore to the question about sour food, in order to teach that dishes prepared\nwith curds and other sour substances may be eaten.\n\n[63:22](sbe0220.htm#fr_387) Manu V, 8; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 170.\n\n[63:23](sbe0220.htm#fr_388) Manu V, 8, 9; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I 170. \'Sandhini,\ntranslated by "females that give milk while big with young," means, according\nto others, "female animals that give milk once a day."--Haradatta.\n\n[63:24](sbe0220.htm#fr_389) Manu V, 8.\n\n[63:26](sbe0220.htm#fr_390) Manu V, 5; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 176.\n\n[64:27](sbe0220.htm#fr_391) Haradatta observes that \xc3\x82pastamba, finding the\nlist of forbidden vegetables too long, refers his pupils to the advice of the\n_S_ ish _t_ as. The force of this Sutra is exactly the same as that of I, 3,\n11, 38.\n\n[64:28](sbe0220.htm#fr_392) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 171.\n\n[64:29](sbe0220.htm#fr_393) The camel, Gayal, and _S_ arabha are mentioned as\n\'forbidden animals,\' _S_ atapatha-br. I, 2, 1, 8; Aitareya-br. II, 1, 8; see\nalso Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 62; Manu V, 11, 18; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 172, 176.\n\n[64:32](sbe0220.htm#fr_394) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 176.\n\n[64:33](sbe0220.htm#fr_395) Manu V, 12. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 172.\n\n[64:34](sbe0220.htm#fr_396) Manu V, 11; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 172.\n\n[64:35](sbe0220.htm#fr_397) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 172.\n\n[64:36](sbe0220.htm#fr_398) Manu V, 12; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 172. Other commentators\ntake the whole Sutra as one compound, and explain it as an exception to Sutra\n34. In that case the translation runs thus: (\'Carnivorous birds are forbidden)\nexcept the Kru _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a, Krau _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a, Vardhra _n_ asa, p. 65 and Lakshma\n_n_ a.\'--Haradatta. This translation is objectionable, because both the Kru\n_\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a, now called Kulam or Ku _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ , and the Krau _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a, the red-\ncrested crane, now called Saras (Cyrus), feed on grain. Kru _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ akrau _\xc3\xb1_\n_k_ a is a Vedic dual and stands for kru _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ akrau _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a or kru _\xc3\xb1_\n_k_ akrau _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ au.\n\n[65:37](sbe0220.htm#fr_399) Manu V, 18; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 77. Putikhasha is,\naccording to Haradatta, an animal resembling a hare, and found in the\nHimalayas.\n\n[65:39](sbe0220.htm#fr_400) Haradatta closes this chapter on flesh-eating by\nquoting Manu V, 56, which declares flesh-eating, drinking spirituous liquor,\nand promiscuous intercourse to be allowable, but the abstinence therefrom of\ngreater merit. He states that the whole chapter must be understood in this\nsense.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Pa _t_ ala 6, Kha _n_ _d_ a 18](sbe0221.htm)\n\n'
