From reasoning and from another Vedic passage.\n\nThat the effect exists before its origination and is non-different from the\ncause, follows from reasoning as well as from a further scriptural passage.\n\nWe at first set forth the argumentation.--Ordinary experience teaches us that\nthose who wish to produce certain effects, such as curds, or earthen jars, or\ngolden ornaments, employ for their purpose certain determined causal\nsubstances such as milk, clay, and gold; those who wish to produce sour milk\ndo not employ clay, nor do those who intend to make jars employ milk and so\non. But, according to that doctrine which teaches that the effect is non-\nexistent (before its actual production), all this should be possible. For if\nbefore their actual origination all effects are equally non-existent in any\ncausal substance, why then should curds be produced from milk only and not\nfrom clay also, and jars from clay only and not from milk as well?--Let us\nthen maintain, the asatkaryavadin rejoins, that there is indeed an equal non-\nexistence of any effect in any cause, but that at the same time each causal\nsubstance has a certain capacity reaching beyond itself (ati _s_ aya) for some\nparticular effect only and not for other effects; that, for instance, milk\nonly, and not clay, has a certain capacity for curds; and clay only, and not\nmilk, an analogous capacity for jars.--What, we ask in return, do you\nunderstand by that 'ati _s_ aya?' If you understand by it the antecedent\ncondition of the effect (before its actual origination), you abandon your\ndoctrine that the effect does not exist in the cause, and prove our doctrine\naccording to which it does so exist. If, on the other hand, you understand by\nthe ati _s_ aya a certain power of the cause assumed to the end of accounting\nfor the fact that only one determined effect springs from the cause, you must\nadmit that the power can\n\np. 335\n\ndetermine the particular effect only if it neither is other (than cause and\neffect) nor non-existent; for if it were either, it would not be different\nfrom anything else which is either non-existent or other than cause and\neffect, (and how then should it alone be able to produce the particular\neffect?) Hence it follows that that power is identical with the Self of the\ncause, and that the effect is identical with the Self of that power.--\nMoreover, as the ideas of cause and effect on the one hand and of substance\nand qualities on the other hand are not separate ones, as, for instance, the\nideas of a horse and a buffalo, it follows that the identity of the cause and\nthe effect as well as of the substance and its qualities has to be admitted.\n(Let it then be assumed, the opponent rejoins, that the cause and the effect,\nalthough really different, are not apprehended as such, because they are\nconnected by the so-called samavaya connexion 1.--If, we reply, you assume the\nsamavaya connexion between cause and effect, you have either to admit that the\nsamavaya itself is joined by a certain connexion to the two terms which are\nconnected by samavaya, and then that connexion will again require a new\nconnexion (joining it to the two terms which it binds together), and you will\nthus be compelled to postulate an infinite series of connexions; or else you\nwill have to maintain that the samavaya is not joined by any connexion to the\nterms which it binds together, and from that will result the dissolution of\nthe bond which connects the two terms of the samavaya relation 2.--Well then,\nthe opponent rejoins, let us assume that the samavaya connexion as itself\nbeing a connexion may be connected with the terms which it joins without the\nhelp of any further connexion.--Then, we reply, conjunction (sa _m_ yoga) also\nmust be connected with the two terms which it joins without the help of the\nsamavaya\n\np. 336\n\nconnexion; for conjunction also is a kind of connexion 1.--Moreover, as\nsubstances, qualities, and so on are apprehended as standing in the relation\nof identity, the assumption of the samavaya relation has really no purport.\n\nIn what manner again do you--who maintain that the cause and the effect are\njoined by the samavaya relation--assume a substance consisting of parts which\nis an effect to abide in its causes, i.e. in the material parts of which it\nconsists? Does it abide in all the parts taken together or in each particular\npart?--If you say that it abides in all parts together, it follows that the\nwhole as such cannot be perceived, as it is impossible that all the parts\nshould be in contact with the organs of perception. (And let it not be\nobjected that the whole may be apprehended through some of the parts only),\nfor manyness which abides in all its substrates together (i.e. in all the many\nthings), is not apprehended so long as only some of those substrates are\napprehended.--Let it then be assumed that the whole abides in all the parts by\nthe mediation of intervening aggregates of parts 2.--In that case, we reply,\nwe should have to assume other parts in addition to the primary originative\nparts of the whole, in order that by means of those other parts the whole\ncould abide in the primary parts in the manner indicated by you. For we see\n(that one thing which abides in another abides there by means of parts\ndifferent from those of that other thing), that the sword, for instance,\npervades the sheath by means of parts different from the parts of the sheath.\nBut an assumption of that kind would lead us into a regressus in infinitum,\nbecause in order to explain how the whole abides in certain\n\np. 337\n\ngiven parts we should always have to assume further parts  1.--Well, then, let\nus maintain the second alternative, viz. that the whole abides in each\nparticular part.--That also cannot be admitted; for if the whole is present in\none part it cannot be present in other parts also; not any more than Devadatta\ncan be present in _S_ rughna and in Pa _t_ aliputra on one and the same day.\nIf the whole were present in more than one part, several wholes would result,\ncomparable to Devadatta and Yag _\xc3\xb1_ adatta, who, as being two different\npersons, may live one of them at _S_ rughna and the other at Pa _t_ aliputra.\n--If the opponent should rejoin that the whole may be fully present in each\npart, just as the generic character of the cow is fully present in each\nindividual cow; we point out that the generic attributes of the cow are\nvisibly perceived in each individual cow, but that the whole is not thus\nperceived in each particular part. If the whole were fully present in each\npart, the consequence would be that the whole would produce its effects\nindifferently with any of its parts; a cow, for instance, would give milk from\nher horns or her tail. But such things are not seen to take place.\n\nWe proceed to consider some further arguments opposed to the doctrine that the\neffect does not exist in the cause.--That doctrine involves the conclusion\nthat the actual origination of an effect is without an agent and thus devoid\nof substantial being. For origination is an action, and as such requires an\nagent  2, just as the action of walking does. To speak of an action without an\nagent would be a contradiction.\n\np. 338\n\n[paragraph continues] But if you deny the pre-existence of the effect in the\ncause, it would have to be assumed that whenever the origination of a jar, for\ninstance, is spoken of the agent is not the jar (which before its origination\ndid not exist) but something else, and again that when the origination of the\ntwo halves of the jar is spoken of the agent is not the two halves but\nsomething else. From this it would follow that the sentence, 'the jar is\noriginated' means as much as 'the potter and the other (operative) causes are\noriginated  1.' But as a matter of fact the former sentence is never\nunderstood to mean the latter; and it is, moreover, known that at the time\nwhen the jar originates, the potter, &c. are already in existence.--Let us\nthen say, the opponent resumes, that origination is the connexion of the\neffect with the existence of its cause and its obtaining existence as a Self.\n--How, we ask in reply, can something which has not yet obtained existence\nenter into connexion with something else? A connexion is possible of two\nexisting things only, not of one existing and one non-existing thing or of two\nnon-existing things. To something non-existing which on that account is\nindefinable, it is moreover not possible to assign a limit as the opponent\ndoes when maintaining that the effect is non-existing before its origination;\nfor experience teaches us that existing things only such as fields and houses\nhave limits, but not non-existing things. If somebody should use, for\ninstance, a phrase such as the following one, 'The son of a barren woman was\nking previously to the coronation of Pur _n_ avarman,' the declaration of a\nlimit in time implied in that phrase does not in reality determine that the\nson of the barren woman, i.e. a mere non-entity, either was or is or will be\nking. If the son of a barren woman could become an existing thing subsequently\nto the activity of some causal\n\np. 339\n\nagent, in that case it would be possible also that the non-existing effect\nshould be something existing, subsequently to the activity of some causal\nagent. But we know that the one thing can take place no more than the other\nthing; the non-existing effect and the son of the barren woman ace both\nequally non-entities and can never be.--But, the asatkaryavadin here objects,\nfrom your doctrine there follows the result that the activity of causal agents\nis altogether purposeless. For if the effect were lying already fully\naccomplished in the cause and were non-different from it, nobody would\nendeavour to bring it about, no more than anybody endeavours to bring about\nthe cause which is already fully accomplished previously to all endeavour. But\nas a matter of fact causal agents do endeavour to bring about effects, and it\nis in order not to have to condemn their efforts as altogether useless that we\nassume the non-existence of the effect previously to its origination.--Your\nobjection is refuted, we reply, by the consideration that the endeavour of the\ncausal agent may be looked upon as having a purpose in so far as it arranges\nthe causal substance in the form of the effect. That, however, even the form\nof the effect (is not something previously non-existing, but) belongs to the\nSelf of the cause already because what is devoid of Selfhood cannot be begun\nat all, we have already shown above.--Nor does a substance become another\nsubstance merely by appearing under a different aspect. Devadatta may at one\ntime be seen with his arms and legs closely drawn up to his body, and another\ntime with his arms and legs stretched out, and yet he remains the same\nsubstantial being, for he is recognised as such. Thus the persons also by whom\nwe are surrounded, such as fathers, mothers, brothers, &c., remain the same,\nalthough we see them in continually changing states and attitudes; for they\nare always recognised as fathers, mothers, brothers, and so on. If our\nopponent objects to this last illustrative example on the ground that fathers,\nmothers, and so on remain the same substantial beings, because the different\nstates in which they appear are not separated from each other by birth or\ndeath, while the effect, for instance a jar, appears only after\n\np. 340\n\nthe cause, for instance the clay, has undergone destruction as it were (so\nthat the effect may be looked upon as something altogether different from the\ncause); we rebut this objection by remarking that causal substances also such\nas milk, for instance, are perceived to exist even after they have entered\ninto the condition of effects such as curds and the like (so that we have no\nright to say that the cause undergoes destruction). And even in those cases\nwhere the continued existence of the cause is not perceived, as, for instance,\nin the case of seeds of the fig-tree from which there spring sprouts and\ntrees, the term 'birth' (when applied to the sprout) only means that the\ncausal substance, viz. the seed, becomes visible by becoming a sprout through\nthe continual accretion of similar particles of matter; and the term 'death'\nonly means that, through the secession of those particles, the cause again\npasses beyond the sphere of visibility. Nor can it be said that from such\nseparation by birth and death as described just now it follows that the non-\nexisting becomes existing, and the existing non-existing; for if that were so,\nit would also follow that the unborn child in the mother's womb and the new-\nborn babe stretched out on the bed are altogether different beings.\n\nIt would further follow that a man is not the same person in childhood,\nmanhood, and old age, and that terms such as father and the like are\nillegitimately used.--The preceding arguments may also be used to refute the\n(Bauddha doctrine) of all existence being momentary only 1.\n\nThe doctrine that the effect is non-existent previously to its actual\norigination, moreover, leads to the conclusion that the activity of the causal\nagent has no object; for what does not exist cannot possibly be an object; not\nany more than the ether can be cleft by swords and other weapons for striking\nor cutting. The object can certainly not be the inherent cause; for that would\nlead to the erroneous conclusion that from the activity of the causal agent,\nwhich has for its object the inherent cause, there results something else\n\nPage 341\n\n[paragraph continues] (viz. the effect). And if (in order to preclude this\nerroneous conclusion) the opponent should say that the effect is (not\nsomething different from the cause, but) a certain relative power (ati _s_\naya) of the inherent cause; he thereby would simply concede our doctrine,\naccording to which the effect exists in the cause already.\n\nWe maintain, therefore, as our final conclusion, that milk and other\nsubstances are called effects when they are in the state of curds and so on,\nand that it is impossible, even within hundreds of years, ever to bring about\nan effect which is different from its cause. The fundamental cause of all\nappears in the form of this and that effect, up to the last effect of all,\njust as an actor appears in various robes and costumes, and thereby becomes\nthe basis for all the current notions and terms concerning the phenomenal\nworld.\n\nThe conclusion here established, on the ground of reasoning, viz. that the\neffect exists already before its origination, and is non-different from its\ncause, results also from a different scriptural passage. As under the\npreceding Sutra a Vedic passage was instanced which speaks of the non-\nexisting, the different passage referred to in the present Sutra is the one (\n_Kh_. Up. VI, 2, 1) which refers to that which is. That passage begins, 'Being\nonly was this in the beginning, one without a second,' refers, thereupon, to\nthe doctrine of the Non-existent being the cause of the world ('Others say,\nNon-being was this in the beginning'), raises an objection against that\ndoctrine ('How could that which is be born of that which is not?'), and,\nfinally, reaffirms the view first set forth, 'Only Being was this in the\nbeginning.' The circumstance that in this passage the effect, which is denoted\nby the word 'this,' is by Scripture, with reference to the time previous to\nits origination, coordinated with the cause denoted by the term 'Being,'\nproves that the effect exists in--and is non-different from--the cause. If it\nwere before its origination non-existing and after it inhered in its cause by\nsamavaya, it would be something different from the cause, and that would\nvirtually imply an abandonment of the promise made in the passage, 'That\ninstruction by which we hear what is not heard,' &c.\n\np. 342\n\n[paragraph continues] (VI, 1, 3). The latter assertion is ratified, on the\nother hand, through the comprehension that the effect exists in--and is not\ndifferent from--the cause.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[335:1](sbe34157.htm#fr_297) Samavaya, commonly translated by inherence or\nintimate relation, is, according to the Nyaya, the relation connecting a whole\nand its parts, substances, and qualities, &c.\n\n[335:2](sbe34157.htm#fr_298) Samavayasya svatantryapaksha _m_ dushayati\nanabhyupagamyamane _k_ eti.
