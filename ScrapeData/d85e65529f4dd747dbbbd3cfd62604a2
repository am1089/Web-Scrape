I will now\nnarrate how Huri came into the womb, and how Bruhmu and the other gods sung\nthe praises of the foetus, and how Dewee took Buldeo Jee to Gokool--One day\nthe Raja Kuns came and sat in his court, and having summoned all his demons\nsaid to them, "All the gods have been born upon the earth, and amongst them\nKrishnu will also make his descent. Narud, the sage, has explained this secret\nto me; for this reason, it is right, that you should go, and utterly destroy\nall the family of Judoo, so that not one of them may be left alive."\n\nHaving obtained this order, all made their obeisance and departed, and after\ncoming to the city, searching for and seizing the members of the family of\nJudoo, they began to bind them,-and whether they were eating, drinking,\nstanding, sitting, asleep, awake, or going to and fro from place to place,\nthey did not let go a single one; and having surrounded them, they brought\nthem into one place, and put them all to death by burning, drowning, dashing\nthem against stones, and other tortures.--In this manner, all the devils both\ngreat and small, assuming various frightful shapes, began to search every\ncity, village, lane, and house for the members of the family of Judoo, and to\ndestroy\n\np. 18\n\nthem; and the family of Judoo being distressed, and abandoning their country,\nfled, taking only their lives with them. All this time, all the other wives of\nBasoodeo came with Rohnee from Muttra to Gokool, where Basoodeo\'s chief\nfriend, Nund Jee was dwelling, who received them with great affection, and\nrestored them to confidence, and they dwelt in his house with great delight.\nWhen Kuns began thus to vex the gods, and to commit great crimes, Vishnu\ncreated an illusive form from his eyes, which, joining its hands, came before\nhim Vishnu said to it, "Go thou now, and make a descent into the city of\nMuttra, where the demon Kuns is causing distress to my worshippers, and Kusyp\nand Adit, that is, Jusodha and Dewukee, have gone; Kuns has closely confined\nthem, and put six of their children to death; the seventh in the womb now is\nLuchman Jee, whom having taken from the womb of Dewukee, and carried to\nGokool, place in such a manner in the womb of Rohnee, that no devil may know\nof it, and all the people of that part of the country will celebrate your\npraises."\n\nHaving thus instructed the illusive form, Shree Narayun said, "Having first\ngone, and completed this work, be born in the house of Nund, and afterwards in\nthat of Basoodeo; I also will come to Nund\'s house." On hearing this, the\nillusive form came quickly to Muttra, and entered the house of Basoodeo, in\nthe form of Mohnee. The foetus she took away secretly, she went and gave to\nRohnee; all people thought it her first pregnancy--Bhugwan was born from\nRohnee.\n\nIn this manner on the fourteenth of the light part of the month Sawun, on a\nWednesday, Buldeo Jee was born in Gokool; and the illusion caused Basoodeo and\nDewukee to dream, that she had carried away their child from the womb of\nDewukee, and given it to Rohnee, and told them not to be at all anxious. On\nhearing this in their dream, Basoodeo and Dewukee awoke from sleep, and began\nto say to each other, "Bhugwan has done well in this, but we must now inform\n\np. 19\n\nKuns of the circumstance; otherwise, there is no knowing what pain he may\ninflict on us hereafter." Thinking thus, they informed their guards, who went\nand said to Kuns, "O great king! Dewukee has miscarried; no child has been\nborn." On hearing this Kuns said in alarm, "Be very careful this time, because\nI have a dread of the eighth pregnancy, which the voice from heaven spoke of."\nHaving narrated thus much, Shree Shookdeo Jee said, Raja! Buldeo Jee having\nthus appeared, when Shree Krishnu came into the womb of Dewukee, the illusion\nwent and took up its abode in the womb of Jusodha, the wife of Nund. Both were\npregnant, when Dewukee during a festival went to the Jumna to bathe; by chance\nJusodha came, and met her there--They began to talk of their mutual troubles:\nsuddenly, Jusodha said to Dewukee, "I will keep your child, and give you\nmine." After this conversation, they both returned to their respective homes.\nAfterwards, when Kuns learnt that Dewukee was pregnant with her eighth child,\nhe surrounded Basoodeo\'s house; he placed guards of devils on all four sides,\nand having sent for Basoodeo, said to him, "Do not deceive me this time, bring\nyour child to me; because on a former occasion I believed what you said."\nHaving thus spoken, he placed fetters and handcuffs on Basoodeo and Dewukee;\nand having shut them up in one room, placing locks upon locks to prevent\naccess, Kuns came to his own house, and fasting through fear went to sleep;\nand again very early in the morning went to the place, where Basoodeo and\nDewukee were. Seeing that the pregnancy was clearly manifest, he exclaimed,\n"In this cave of death, my destruction is contained; I could kill the mother,\nbut I am afraid of the infamy which would attach to me from the act, because\nit would not be right for me, who am so powerful, to kill a woman--well, I\nwill destroy her son." Saying this, and coming outside, he placed as guards\nelephants, lions, dogs, and his own powerful warriors--and he himself watched\nconstantly--but did not\n\np. 20\n\nobtain a moment\'s ease. Wherever he looked, he beheld during the eight puhurs\nand sixty-four ghurees Krishnu in the form of death, from dread of which, he\nspent every night and day in most anxious thought. This was the state of Kuns;\nwhile Basoodeo and Dewukee in great affliction, the time for the birth having\narrived, were propitiating Shree Krishnu, when Bhugwan came, and caused them\nto dream, and banished all their care by telling them, that he would soon be\nborn, and put an end to all their anxiety, and told them not to indulge in\nregrets. On hearing this, Basoodeo and Dewukee awoke. At this time Bruhmu,\nRoodru, Indru and all the gods, having left their chariots in mid air, and\nbeing invisible, came to Basoodeo\'s house, and joining their hands, and\nsinging the Vedas, they began to celebrate the praises of the child in the\nwomb. At which time, no one saw them, but all heard the musical sounds of the\nsinging of the Vedas. All the guards were amazed at this strange circumstance,\nand Basoodeo and Dewukee were certain, that Bhugwan would quickly put an end\nto their troubles.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter IV](psa05.htm)\n\n'
