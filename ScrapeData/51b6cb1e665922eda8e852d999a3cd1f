For pity's sake  \nAccept the word the monarch spake.  \nThy husband's will, O Queen, obey,  \nAnd be the people's hope and stay.  \nO, do not, urged by follv, draw  \nThe king to tread on duty's law,  \nThe lord who all the world sustains,  \nBright as the God o'er Gods who reigns.  \nOur glorious king, by sin unstained,  \nWill never grant what fraud obtained;  \nNo shade of fault in him is seen:  \nLet Rama be anointed, Queen.  \nRemember, Queen, undying shame  \nWill through the world pursue thy name,  \nIf Rama leave the king his sire,  \nAnd, banished, to the wood retire.  \nCome, from thy breast this fever fling:  \nOf his own realm be Rama king.  \nNone in this city e'er can dwell  \nTo tend and love thee half so well.  \nWhen Rama sits in royal place,  \nTrue to the custom of his race  \nOur monarch of the mighty bow  \nA hermit to the woods will go.'  1  \n\nSumantra thus, palm joined to palm,  \nPoured forth his words of bane and balm,  \nWith keen reproach, with pleading kind,  \nStriving to move Kaikeyi's mind.  \nIn vain he prayed, in vain reproved,  \nShe heard unsoftened and unmoved.  \nNor could the eyes that watched her view  \nOne yielding look, one change of hue.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[137:1](ry113.htm#fr_310) It was the custom of the kings of the solar dynasty\nto resign in their extreme old age the kingdom to the heir, and spend the\nremainder of their days in holy meditation in the forest:  \n   'For such through ages in their life's decline  \n    Is the good custom of Ikshvaku's line.'  \n                                 _Raghuvans'a._\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXXVI.: Siddharth's Speech.](ry114.htm)\n\n"
