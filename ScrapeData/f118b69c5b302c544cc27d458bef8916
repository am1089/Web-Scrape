Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus, in due course, Devaki, the goddess incarnate,\nbeing united according to rules with Vasudeva, became pregnant.\n\n\n\n2-4. When full ten months were over, a good-looking and beautiful child (male)\nwas first born to Devaki. Then the good-natured Vasudeva remembered his\npromise, and also what is ordained by Heaven; and he spoke to Devaki, the part\nincarnate of Aditi \xc2\x93O fair-looking! You know that I saved your life at your\nmarriage by swearing on oath to deliver all your fresh-born children to Kamsa.\nNow has come the time to hand over your child to Kamsa.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n5\\. O good-haired woman! Now I will hand your this son to Kamsa. Know Kamsa is\nvery cruel and wicked. I cannot say what step he will take, urged on by Fate,\nto kill your child. O Sweet One! We have no hands in the matter. The effects\nof Karma are exceedingly puzzling. Ordinary persons cannot know them.\n\n\n\np. 330\n\n\n\n6\\. All persons are subject to Time, the Destroyer, and enjoy the merits or\ndemerits of their past deeds. The effects of past Karma are fashioned by the\nCreator; knowing this, allow me to take away your child.\n\n\n\n7\\. Devaki said :-- O Lord! Certainly men have to suffer fully the effects of\ntheir past Karmas. But can that not be upset by residing in holy places,\npractising penances and asceticism or by making generous gifts?\n\n\n\n8-9. The high minded Mahar _s_ is have fixed rules and penances for destroying\nthe sins of past deeds; twelve years\xc2\x92 vow to observe penances can purify one\nfrom sins, e.g., Brahmi _n_ icide, stealing gold, drinking or stealing the\nwife of one\xc2\x92s preceptor and many others.\n\n\n\n10-11. O Sinless one! Will not any one be freed from their sinful effects, if\nthey observe practices and penances as are ordained by Manu or other Munis? If\nyou don\xc2\x92t accept penances to be sufficiently purificatory, do you mean to say,\nthen, that what the Mahar _s_ is, seers, Yaj\xc3\xb1avalkya and other promulgators of\nreligious doctrines have uttered, they did so, as an act of dire falsehood and\nvillainy?\n\n\n\n12\\. O My husband! \xc2\x93What is in the womb of Fate will surely come to pass,\xc2\x94 if\nthis be taken as granted, then the whole Ayurveda (medicinal books) and Mantra\nvadas, the science and recitation of mantras or sacred formulae turn out\nutterly fruitless and false!\n\n\n\n13-16. If all the actions are under the control of Fate, then no effect can\ncome out of any effort; so all efforts are reduced to no effect. If what is\nordained by Heaven is to come to pass then what is the use of taking recourse\nto any action and Agni _st_ oma sacrifices, etc., that are declared to lead to\nHeavens. Judge! If Heaven or Fate you consider all-in-all, then the whole\nVedas, the revelations from God\xc2\x92s mouth turn out false; if the Vedas be false,\nthen there is no reason why the whole Dharma will not be destroyed.\n\n\n\nN.B. :-- Fate is here denounced.\n\n\n\n17\\. Now when it is seen that effects do come out whenever any exertion is\nmade, then you ought to think out carefully and find out some means to avert\ndanger. Therefore do you judge and find out a good way of preserving the life\nof this new born baby.\n\n\n\nThe learned people say that to tell a lie is not a sin, if you can thereby\nsave a life, and have an honest motive for the welfare of all.\n\nNote :-- Here is a diplomatic statement!\n\n\n\n18\\. Vasudeva said :-- O blessed one! I now tell you what is truth and the\nmatters connected with truth.\n\n\n\n19-20. Effort, application and manifestation of energy are certainly the\nduties of man; but their effects are all under the Great Destiny or Fate.\n\n\n\np. 331\n\n\n\nThe Pundits knowing the ancient lore say that there are three kinds of Karma\nmentioned in the Pura _n_ as and \xc3\x82gamas :-- First, the Sanchita Karma (done in\npast births); the Prarabdha Karma, the Karma already done; and the Vartaman\nKarma (Karma in hand).\n\n\n\n21\\. The Karma, auspicious and inauspicious, done in many previous lives and\npreserved in seed forms, remains always inherent in a human soul. Urged on by\nthis Karma, the Jivas quitting their previous bodies, enjoy Heaven or Hell as\neffects of these, their own acts.\n\n\n\n22-23. According to their good or bad works, the Jivas acquire the higher\nhappy body and enjoy various pleasures in the Heavens, or they take up very\npainful vicious bodies and suffer various pains in hell.\n\n\n\n24-25. At the expiry of the above period in Heaven or Hell, when there comes\nthe time of his assuming another body, the Jiva becomes conscious of the\nsubtle body (Linga Deha) and takes his birth again. When the Linga Deha comes\ninto existence, the part of the Karma done in various previous births that are\nripe and ready to yield their fruits, gets attached to the Jiva by God (or\nDestiny).\n\n\n\n26\\. Therefore the collective effect of Karma done in previous births always\nexists in a Jiva\xc2\x92s body. O Fair-eyed One! The effects of Prarabdha Karma,\nripened and ready to yield their fruits must have to be experienced by a Jiva,\nwhether happy or unhappy.\n\n\n\n27\\. O beautiful young woman! Penances, performed according to rules, destroy\nthe effect of Karmas that are in hand and are weak (i.e., not yet accumulated\nstrongly as to remain in seed forms).\n\n\n\n28\\. The Prarabdha Karma, those acts out of all the previous acts done in\nprevious births that are fully mature and ready to yield their fruits, cannot\nbe averted; their effects must have to be experienced and then they can die\naway; they cannot be expiated by penances or any other remedial measures.\nTherefore you must hand over unconditionally your new born babe unto the hands\nof Kamsa.\n\n\n\n29-30. O Goddess! I have never done any blameable action, nor have I told any\nlie. Therefore do you fulfill your truth and hand over your baby. O Devaki!\nDharma is the only thing permanent and real in this fleeting world. Even the\nbirths and deaths of high souled persons are subject to the great Destiny.\nTherefore the Jivas ought not to be sorry when there is no help for it.\n\n\n\n31\\. O dear one! What shall I say to you! Know this much that his life is\nspent in vain who is lost to Truth. O beautiful one! Whose this life is\ndestroyed, what can he expect in the life to come!\n\n\n\np. 332\n\n\n\n32\\. Therefore, O Goddess! Give me your baby and I will hand it over to Kamsa.\nIf we can observe this truth, we will meet with ample rewards afterwards;\nthere is no doubt in it.\n\n\n\n33\\. Where there are pains and pleasures for the Jivas, there it is highly\nincumbent on us to do good and meritorious deeds. If we can act according to\nTruth, we will certainly get good fruits.\n\n\n\n34\\. Vyasa said :-- Thus addressed by Vasudeva, the husband of Devaki, who was\nvery much grieved and intelligent, gave over the newly born baby, her whole\nbody trembling, to the hands of Vasudeva.\n\n\n\n35\\. The virtuous Vasudeva took that baby and went out to the Kamsa\xc2\x92s palace.\nOn the way, the people, seeing him thus, were very much astonished and began\nto praise him.\n\n\n\n36-37. The people said :-- \xc2\x93O people! See how Vasudeva is sensible to keep his\nwords! He is taking his son to hand over to Kamsa. This truthful and\nhighsouled man, free from malice, is going to give up his son to the hands of\nKamsa who is the Death Personified. See his wonderful patience; this man\xc2\x92s\nlife is really high, noble and true.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n38\\. Vyasa said :-- O King! Vasudeva, thus praised, reached at last the\nKamsa\xc2\x92s palace and handed over his newly-born son to Kamsa.\n\n\n\n39-41. The King Kamsa, too, was very much astonished to see this wonderful\npatience of Vasudeva. Then he held aloft the child and laughed and said :-- \xc2\x93O\nson of S\xc2\x92urasena, you have been blessed today by giving me your son just now.\nBut the voice from Heaven said that your eighth son will be the cause of my\ndeath; this your first son is not my cause of death. Therefore I will not kill\nthis baby; you can take your baby back to your home.\n\n\n\nO High-minded One! Let me have your eighth son brought here, when he will be\nborn; I hope you will positively do it.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n42\\. The cruel and wicked Kamsa returned the child and said :-- \xc2\x93Let this\nchild go back safely to his home.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n43-44. When the king Kamsa said thus, Vasudeva, the son of S\xc2\x92urasena gladly\ntook his child back and came home. Then the King Kamsa told his ministers that\nthe Heavenly voice told that the eighth son would he the cause of his death;\nand so there was no necessity to kill that child. There was no need to incur\nsin by killing the first child.\n\n\n\n45\\. The ministers, hearing the king Kamsa\xc2\x92s those words, began to praise him\nvery much and exclaimed repeatedly \xc2\x93Well done\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93Well done.\xc2\x94 They went away to\ntheir respective homes, when ordered to do so by Kamsa.\n\n\n\n46-49. Now Narada, the best of the Munis, arrived to Kamsa. The king Kamsa,\nthe son of Ugrasena, stood up at once and offered him water to wash\n\n\n\np. 333\n\n\n\nhis mouth and with green grass and rice worshipped him devotedly and enquired\nof his welfare. He then asked the Muni about the cause of his untimely arrival\nthere. The Mahar _s_ i Narada then smilingly and with sweet words repeatedly\nuttered \xc2\x93Kamsa,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93Kamsa\xc2\x94 and then said, O blessed one! I went perchance to\nSumeru Mountain. There Brahma and other gods formed an assembly and were thus\nthinking out plans that Vi _sn_ u, the Supreme God, would take His birth in\nthe womb of Devaki, the wife of Vasudeva to kill Kamsa.\n\n\n\n50\\. Now I ask you, you are very expert as a politician; then why have you not\nkilled the son of Vasudeva? Kamsa said :-- \xc2\x93I will kill the eighth son\naccording to the Heavenly Voice.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n51\\. Narada said :-- O King! Now I understand that you do not understand\nanything of politics, leading to auspicious or inauspicious results;\nespecially when you are quite ignorant of the Maya of the Devas, then what\nshall I say to you!\n\n\n\n52-53. The truth is this :-- The warriors, looking after their own welfare,\nnever overlook the weakest of their foes. What have you understood when the\nHeavenly Voice uttered \xc2\x93the eighth son.\xc2\x94 It means the children counted from\nthe first and then finished upto eighth; it may mean first, second, third or\nupto eighth. Never forego your enemies; then why have you desisted in killing\nyour enemy when you got that enemy in your possession. Nothing is shewn of you\nin this act save dire foolishness, and ignorance.\n\n\n\n54\\. Thus saying, the Mahar _s_ i Narada vanished quickly. Kamsa, of little\nunderstanding brought back the son of Vasudeva and killed him by dashing him\nagainst a stone and was relieved.\n\n\n\nNote :-- This human body is a microcosm; the universe is the macrocosm. God\nresides in the centre and controls the two. In this human body also live the\nDevas and the Danavas. The left half of the body, the \xc3\x8eda side, is the seat of\nthe Devas. The right half, the Pingala side, is the seat of the Danavas. In\nthis body war is always going on between the Devas and Danavas. Sometimes the\nDevas get victory; sometimes the Danavas win. God is in the centre, the heart\nand controls the two.\n\n\n\nHere ends the 21st Chapter of S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, the Maha Pura _n_ am\nof 18,000 verses composed by Veda Vyasa, on the killing of the sons of Devaki.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 22](bk04ch22.htm)\n\n'
