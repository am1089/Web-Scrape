If it is said that (the word 'seeing') has a figurative meaning, we deny\nthat, on account of the word Self (being applied to the cause of the world).\n\nYour assertion that the term 'Being' denotes the non-intelligent pradhana, and\nthat thought is ascribed to it in a figurative sense only, as it is to fire\nand water, is untenable. Why so? On account of the term 'Self.' For the\npassage _Kh_. Up. VI, 2, which begins 'Being only, my dear, this was in the\nbeginning,' after having related the creation of fire, water, and earth ('it\nthought,' &c.; 'it sent forth fire,' &c.), goes on--denoting the thinking\nprinciple of which the whole chapter treats, and likewise fire, water, and\nearth, by the term--'divinities'--as follows, 'That divinity thought: Let me\nnow enter those three divinities with this living Self ( _g_ iva. atman) and\nevolve names and forms.' If we assumed that in this passage the non-\nintelligent pradhana is figuratively spoken of as thinking, we should also\nhave to assume that the same pradhana--as once constituting the subject-matter\nof the chapter--is referred to by the term 'that divinity.' But in that case\nthe divinity would not speak of the _g_ iva as 'Self.' For by the term ' _G_\niva' we must understand, according to the received meaning and the etymology\nof the word, the intelligent (principle) which rules over the body and\nsustains the vital airs. How could such a principle be the Self of the non-\nintelligent pradhana? By 'Self' we understand (a being's) own nature, and it\nis clear that the intelligent _G_ iva cannot constitute the nature of the non-\nintelligent pradhana. If, on the other hand, we refer the whole chapter to the\nintelligent Brahman, to\n\np. 54\n\nwhich thought in its primary sense belongs, the use of the word 'Self' with\nreference to the _G_ iva is quite adequate. Then again there is the other\npassage, 'That which is that subtle essence, in it all that exists has its\nself. It is the true. It is the Self. That art thou, O _S_ vetaketu' ( _Kh_.\nUp. VI, 8, 7, &c.). Here the clause 'It is the Self' designates the Being of\nwhich the entire chapter treats, viz. the subtle Self, by the word 'Self,' and\nthe concluding clause, 'that art thou, O _S_ vetaketu,' declares the\nintelligent _S_ vetaketu to be of the nature of the Self. Fire and water, on\nthe other hand, are non-intelligent, since they are objects (of the mind), and\nsince they are declared to be implicated in the evolution of names and forms.\nAnd as at the same time there is no reason for ascribing to them thought in\nits primary sense--while the employment of the word 'Self' furnishes such a\nreason with reference to the Sat--the thought attributed to them must be\nexplained in a figurative sense, like the inclination of the river-bank.\nMoreover, the thinking on the part of fire and water is to be understood as\ndependent on their being ruled over by the Sat. On the other hand, the thought\nof the Sat is, on account of the word 'Self,' not to be understood in a\nfigurative sense. 1\n\nHere the Sa _n_ khya comes forward with a new objection. The word 'Self,' he\nsays, may be applied to the pradhana, although unintelligent, because it is\nsometimes figuratively used in the sense of 'that which effects all purposes\nof another;' as, for instance, a king applies the word 'Self' to some servant\nwho carries out all the king's intentions, 'Bhadrasena is my (other) Self.'\nFor the pradhana, which effects the enjoyment and the emancipation of the\nsoul, serves the latter in the same way as a minister serves his king in the\naffairs of peace and war. Or else, it may be said, the one word 'Self' may\nrefer to non-intelligent things as well as to intelligent beings, as we see\nthat such expressions as 'the Self of the elements,' 'the Self of the senses,'\nare made use of, and as the one word 'light' ( _g_ yotis) denotes a certain\n\np. 55\n\nsacrifice (the _g_ yotish _t_ oma) as well as a flame. How then does it follow\nfrom the word 'Self' that the thinking (ascribed to the cause of the world) is\nnot to be taken in a figurative sense?\n\nTo this last argumentation the Sutrakara replies:\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[54:1](sbe34012.htm#fr_99) So that, on this latter explanation, it is\nunnecessary to assume a figurative sense of the word 'thinking' in any of the\nthree passages.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 1, 7](sbe34013.htm)\n\n"
