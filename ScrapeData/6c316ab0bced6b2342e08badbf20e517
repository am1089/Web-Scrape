If it be maintained that (Vai _s_ vanara is) not (the highest Lord) on\naccount of the term (viz. Vai _s_ vanara, having a settled different meaning),\n&c., and on account of his abiding within (which is a characteristic of the\ngastric fire); (we say) no, on account of the perception (of the highest\nLord), being taught thus (viz. in the gastric fire), and on account of the\nimpossibility (of the heavenly world, &c. being the head, &c. of the gastric\nfire), and because they (the Va _g_ asaneyins) read of him (viz. the Vai _s_\nvanara) as man (which term cannot apply to the gastric fire).\n\nHere the following objection is raised.--Vai _s_ vanara cannot be the highest\nLord, on account of the term, &c., and on account of the abiding within. The\nterm, viz. the term Vai _s_ vanara, cannot be applied to the highest Lord,\nbecause the settled use of language assigns to it a different sense. Thus,\nalso, with regard to the term Agni (fire) in the passage ( _S_ at. Bra. X, 6,\n1, 11), \'He is the Agni Vai _s_ vanara.\' The word \'&c.\' (in the Sutra) hints\nat the fiction concerning the three sacred fires, the garhapatya being\nrepresented as the heart, and so on, of the Vai _s_ vanara Self ( _Kh_. Up. V,\n18, 2 1).--Moreover, the passage, \'Therefore the first food which a man may\ntake is in the place of homa\' ( _Kh_. Up. V, 19,1), contains a glorification\nof (Vai _s_ vanara) being the abode of the oblation to Pra _n_ a 2. For these\nreasons we have to understand\n\np. 147\n\nby Vai _s_ vanara the gastric fire.--Moreover, Scripture speaks of the Vai _s_\nvanara as abiding within. \'He knows him abiding within man;\' which again\napplies to the gastric fire only.--With reference to the averment that on\naccount of the specifications contained in the passage, \'His head is Sute _g_\nas,\' &c., Vai _s_ vanara is to be explained as the highest Self, we (the\npurvapakshin) ask: How do you reach the decision that those specifications,\nalthough agreeing with both interpretations, must be assumed to refer to the\nhighest Lord only, and not to the gastric fire?--Or else we may assume that\nthe passage speaks of the elemental fire which abides within and without; for\nthat that fire is also connected with the heavenly world, and so on, we\nunderstand from the mantra, \'He who with his light has extended himself over\nearth and heaven, the two halves of the world, and the atmosphere\' ( _Ri_\ng-veda Sa _m_ h. X, 88, 3).--Or else the attribute of having the heavenly\nworld, and so on, for its members may, on account of its power, be attributed\nto that divinity which has the elemental fire for its body.--Therefore Vai _s_\nvanara is not the highest Lord.\n\nTo all this we reply as follows.--Your assertions are unfounded, \'because\nthere is taught the perception in this manner.\' The reasons (adduced in the\nformer part of the Sutra), viz. the term, and so on, are not sufficient to\nmake us abandon the interpretation according to which Vai _s_ vanara is the\nhighest Lord.--Why?--On account of perception being taught in this manner,\ni.e. without the gastric fire being set aside. For the passages quoted teach\nthe perception of the highest Lord in the gastric fire, analogously to such\npassages as \'Let a man meditate on the mind as Brahman\' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 18,\n1).--Or else they teach that the object of perception is the highest Lord, in\nso far as he has the gastric fire called Vai _s_ vanara for his limiting\ncondition; analogously to such passages as \'He who consists of mind, whose\nbody is breath, whose form is light\' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 14, 2 1). If it were the\naim of the passages about the "Vai _s_ vanara\n\np. 148\n\nto make statements not concerning the highest Lord, but merely concerning the\ngastric fire, there would be no possibility of specifications such as\ncontained in the passage \'His head is Sute _g_ as,\' &c. That also on the\nassumption of Vai _s_ vanara being either the divinity of fire or the\nelemental fire no room is to be found for the said specifications, we shall\nshow under the following Sutra.--Moreover, if the mere gastric fire were\nmeant, there would be room only for a declaration that it abides within man,\nnot that it is man. But, as a matter of fact, the Va _g_ asaneyins speak of\nhim--in their sacred text--as man, \'This Agni Vai _s_ vanara is man; he who\nknows this Agni Vai _s_ vanara as man-like, as abiding within man,\' &c. ( _S_\nat. Bra. X, 6, I, II). The highest Lord, on the other hand, who is the Self of\neverything, may be spoken of as well as man, as abiding within man.--Those\nwho, in the latter part of the Sutra, read \'man-like\' (purushavidham) instead\nof \'man\' (purusham), wish to express the following meaning: If Vai _s_ vanara\nwere assumed to be the gastric fire only, he might be spoken of as abiding\nwithin man indeed, but not as man-like. But the Va _g_ asaneyins do speak of\nhim as man-like,\' He who knows him as man-like, as abiding within man.\'--The\nmeaning of the term man-like is to be concluded from the context, whence it\nwill be seen that, with reference to nature, it means that the highest Lord\nhas the heaven for his head, &c., and is based on the earth; and with\nreference to man, that he forms the head, &c., and is based on the chin (of\nthe devout worshipper 1).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[146:1](sbe34063.htm#fr_160) Na _k_ a garhapatyadih _ri_ dayadita brahma _n_ a\n_h_ sambhavini.
