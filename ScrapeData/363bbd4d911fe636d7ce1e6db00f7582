He (the Adhvaryu) then gives orders (to his assistant, the\nPratiprasthat _ri_ ); 'Lift the log 1! hold up the underlayer!'--[To the Hot\n_ri_ ], 'Recite for\n\np. 192\n\n[paragraph continues] Agni as he is taken forward!'--'Agnidh, follow up with\nthe single sword (-line)!'--'Brahman, mutter the Apratiratha (hymn)!'\n\n9:2:3:22\\. For at that time, as the gods were about to come up in order to\nperform this sacrifice, the Asuras, the mischievous fiends, tried to smite\nthem from the south, saying, 'Ye shall not sacrifice! ye shall not perform the\nsacrifice!'\n\n9:2:3:33\\. The gods said to Indra, 'Thou art the highest and mightiest, and\nstrongest of us: do thou hold those fiends in check!'--'Let the Brahman (n.)\nbe my ally!' he said.--'So be it!' They made B _ri_ haspati his ally, for B\n_ri_ haspati is the Brahman (the priesthood); and having had the Asuras, the\nmischievous fiends, chased away in the south by B _ri_ haspati and Indra, they\nspread this sacrifice in a place free from danger and devilry.\n\n9:2:3:44\\. Now what the gods did then, that is done on this occasion. Those\nfiends, it is true, have now been chased away by the gods themselves, but when\nhe does this, he does so thinking, 'I will do what the gods did;' and having\nhad the Asuras, the mischievous fiends, chased away in the south by Indra and\nB _ri_ haspati, he performs this sacrifice in a place free from danger and\ndevilry.\n\n9:2:3:55\\. As to that Indra, he is that Apratiratha (irresistible hymn); and\nas to that B _ri_ haspati, he is the Brahman (priest) thus, when the Brahman\nmutters the Apratiratha (hymn) he (the Sacrificer), having the Asuras, the\nmischievous fiends, chased away in the south, by Indra and B _ri_ haspati,\nperforms this sacrifice in a place free from danger and devilry. This is why\nthe Brahman mutters the Apratiratha (hymn, Va _g_. S. XVII, 33-44; _Ri_ g v.\nS. X, 103,1-12).\n\np. 193\n\n9:2:3:66\\. 'The swift (Indra), sharpening (his weapon), like a terrible bull,'\n--these are twelve suitable (verses) relating to Indra,--a year consists of\ntwelve months, and Agni (the fire-altar) is the year: as great as Agni is, as\ngreat as is his measure, by so much he drives off the Asuras, the mischievous\nfiends, in the south. With trish _t_ ubh 1 (verses he does so),--the Trish _t_\nubh is the thunderbolt: by the thunderbolt he thus drives off the Asuras, the\nmischievous fiends, in the south. They amount to twenty-two Gayatris 1, and\nthus they relate to Agni, for this is Agni's performance.\n\n9:2:3:77\\. He then takes him up (in the form of a burning piece of firewood),\nwith [Va _g_. S. XVII, 53], 'Upwards may the All-gods bear thee, O Agni, by\ntheir thoughts! . . .' the meaning of this has been explained 2.\n\n9:2:3:88\\. They then go forward, with (Va _g_. S. XVII, 54-58), 'May the\ndivine regions, the goddesses, protect the sacrifice!'--The gods and the\nAsuras, both of them sprung from Pra _g_ apati, were contending for the\nregions, and the gods wrested the regions from the Asuras; and in like manner\ndoes the Sacrificer now wrest the regions from his hateful rival. 'Divine' he\nsays, and thereby makes them divine for himself;--'may the goddesses protect\nthe sacrifice,' that is, 'may the goddesses protect this sacrifice!'--'keeping\noff want and ill-will,'--want is hunger: thus, 'keeping off\nhunger;'--'granting\n\np. 194\n\nto the lord of the sacrifice a share in wealth-affluence,' that is, 'granting\nto the lord of the sacrifice a share in wealth and in affluence;' 'may the\nsacrifice be founded on wealth-affluence!'--that is, 'may the sacrifice be\nfounded on wealth and affluence!'\n\n9:2:3:99\\. 'Glorifying on the kindled fire,'--the glorifying one is the\nSacrificer;--'the hymn-winged,'--for hymns are his wings;--'taken,'--that is,\n'held;'--'praiseworthy,'--that is, 'worthy of worship;'--'(when) they\nsacrificed, encircling the heated cauldron,'--for they did sacrifice, whilst\nencircling the heated (Pravargya) cauldron; 'when the gods offered the\nsacrifice with food,'--for the gods did offer this sacrifice with food.\n\n9:2:3:1010\\. 'To the divine, fostering upholder,'--for he, Agni, is the divine\nupholder, the most fostering;--'he, the approacher of gods, the well-disposed,\nof a hundred draughts,'--for he is indeed an approacher of the gods, and well-\ndisposed, and possessed of a hundred draughts;--'encircling, the gods drew\nnigh unto the sacrifice,'--for encircling him (Agni), the gods drew nigh to\nthe sacrifice;--'the gods stood ready to perform the cult unto the gods,'--the\ncult, doubtless, is the sacrifice, thus, 'the gods stood ready to perform the\nsacrifice to the gods.'\n\n9:2:3:1111\\. 'The welcome oblation slaughtered by the slaughterer 1 to\nsacrifice;'--that is, 'wished-for, much wished-for;'--'where the fourth\nsacrifice goeth to the offering,'--the Adhvaryu first mutters the formulas,\nthe Hot _ri_ afterwards recites\n\np. 195\n\nthe verses, the Brahman mutters the Apratiratha (hymn) on the south side; this\n(set of verses), then, is the fourth sacrifice;--'may the prayers, the\nblessings favour us 1!'--that is, 'may both prayers and blessings favour us!'\n\n9:2:3:1212\\. 'The sun-rayed, golden-haired Savit _ri_ ever lifted up 2 the\nlight in front,'--this Agni, doubtless, is yonder sun, and that sun-rayed,\ngolden-haired Savit _ri_ in front ever lifts up that light;--'at his behest\nPushan goeth, the wise,'--Pushan, doubtless, means cattle, and they indeed\nstart forth at his (Agni-Surya's) behest;--'viewing all beings as their\nguardian,'--for he indeed views everything here, and he is the protector of\nall this world.\n\n9:2:3:1313\\. Now, the gods thereby (viz. by these five verses) wrested from\nthe Asuras the five regions which are on this side of yonder sun, and then\nascended them; and so does the Sacrificer now wrest them from his hateful\nrival, and then ascend them. And by means of them the gods reached this place,\nand in like manner does this (Sacrificer) by means of them reach this place 3.\n\n9:2:3:1414\\. He then sets up a variegated stone;--the\n\np. 196\n\nvariegated stone, doubtless, is yonder sun: it is thus yonder sun that is set\nup. It is variegated, for by means of its rays that disk is variegated. He\nsets it up between the \xc3\x82havaniya and the Garhapatya; for the Garhapatya is\nthis (terrestrial) world, and the \xc3\x82havaniya is the sky: he thus places him\n(the sun) between these two worlds, whence he shines between these two worlds.\n\n9:2:3:1515\\. On the \xc3\x82gnidhra range 1 (he places it), for the \xc3\x82gnidhra's fire-\nshed is the air; he thus places it in the air, whence that (sun) has the air\nfor his seat. Halfway (between the two fires he places it); for that (sun) is\nhalfway from this (earth).\n\n9:2:3:1616\\. This (stone) is the breath,--he thus puts the breath into the\nbody; and it is the vital power,--he thus puts vital power into the body; it\nis food, for it is vital power, and vital power is indeed food. It is a stone,\nfor a stone is firm: he thus makes the vital power firm. It is variegated, for\nfood is variegated (varied).\n\n9:2:3:1717\\. He sets it up (with, Va _g_. S. XVII, 59, 60), 'Measuring he\nkeeps in the middle of the sky,'--for that (sun) indeed keeps measuring in the\nmiddle of the sky;--'filling the two worlds and the air,' for even in rising\nhe fills these (three) worlds, 'he scans the all-reaching, the butter-\nreaching,'--he thereby means the offering-ladles and the offering-\ngrounds;--'between the front and back lights,'--that is, between this world\nand that one; or that (fire-altar) which is here at this moment being built,\nand that which was there built at first.\n\np. 197\n\n9:2:3:1818\\. 'The showering ocean, the ruddy bird,'--for he (the sun) is\nindeed a showering ocean, and a ruddy bird,--'hath entered the seat of his\neasterly father,'--for he indeed enters that seat of his easterly 1\nfather;--'the many-hued rock set up in the middle of the sky,'--for that\nvariegated stone is indeed set up in the middle of the sky;--'hath traversed\nand guardeth the two ends of the atmosphere;'--for in traversing he guards the\nends of these worlds.\n\n9:2:3:1919\\. With two (verses) he sets it up;--two-footed is the Sacrificer,\nand the Sacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure,\nwith so much he thus sets him (the sun, Agni) up. With trish _t_ ubh (verses\nhe sets him up),--for that (sun) is related to the Trish _t_ ubh. He does not\n'settle' (the stone), for unsettled is that (sun); nor does he pronounce the\nSudadohas over it;--the Sudadohas means the breath, and that (sun) is the\nbreath, and why should he put breath into (or on) the breath? Having deposited\nit in such a way that it is not lost;--\n\n9:2:3:2020\\. They now approach (the fire-altar, with, Va _g_. S. XVII, 61-64),\nThey all have magnified Indra,'--the meaning of this has been explained 2.\n'Let the god-invoking sacrifice lead hither, let the favour-invoking sacrifice\nlead hither (the gods)!'--both god-invoking and favour-invoking indeed is the\nsacrifice; 'let Agni, the god, make offering and lead hither the gods!' that\nis, 'may\n\np. 198\n\n[paragraph continues] Agni, the god, both make offering and bring hither the\ngods!'\n\n9:2:3:2121\\. 'The creation of strength hath upheaved me with upheaval, and\nIndra hath laid low mine enemies by subdual,'--as the text, so the meaning.\n\n9:2:3:2222\\. 'May the gods advance the Brahman both by upheaval and subdual;\nand may Indra and Agni scatter asunder mine enemies!'--as the text, so the\nmeaning.\n\n9:2:3:2323\\. Now, the gods thereby (viz. by these four verses) wrested from\nthe Asuras the four regions which are above yonder sun, and then ascended\nthem; and in like manner does the Sacrificer thereby wrest them from his\nhateful enemy, and then ascend them. And by means of them the gods then\nattained to that place; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) by means of\nthem attain thither.\n\n9:2:3:2424\\. They then mount the fire-altar, with (Va _g_. S. XVII, 65-69),\n'By Agni ascend ye to the firmament!'--the firmament, doubtless, is the\nheavenly world: thus, 'by means of this Agni (fire-altar) ascend ye to that\nheavenly world!'--'holding the Ukhya in your hands,'--for the Ukhya (the fire\nin the pan) they do hold in their hands 1;--'having gone to the back of the\nsky, to heaven, keep ye mingling with the gods!'--that is, 'having gone to the\nback of the sky, to the heavenly world, keep ye mingling with the gods!'\n\np. 199\n\n9:2:3:2525\\. 'Go thou forth to the eastern quarter, knowing!'--the eastern\nquarter, doubtless, is Agni's: thus, 'To thine own quarter go thou forth,\nknowing!'--'be thou Agni's fore-fire here, O Agni!'--that is, 'Of this Agni (\n_k_ itya) be thou, O Agni, the fore-fire 1!'--'Shine thou, illumining all\nregions!'--that is, 'shine thou, illuminating every region!'--'Grant thou food\nto our two-footed and four-footed one!' he thereby invokes a blessing.\n\n9:2:3:2626\\. 'From the earth have I ascended the air; from the air have I\nascended the sky;'--for from the Garhapatya they go to the \xc3\x82gnidhriya, and\nfrom the \xc3\x82gnidhriya to the \xc3\x82havaniya;--'from the sky, the back of the\nfirmament, have I gone to heaven, to the light;'--that is, 'from the sky, the\nback of the firmament, have I gone to the heavenly world.'\n\n9:2:3:2727\\. 'The heaven-going look not round, they ascend the heaven, the two\nworlds,'--those who go to the heavenly world do not indeed look round  2; 'the\nwise who performed the all-sustaining sacrifice,'--for that sacrifice is\nindeed all-sustaining 3, and they who perform it are indeed wise.\n\n9:2:3:2828\\. 'Go forward, Agni, first of the godward-going,'--he thereby says\nto this Agni (that is carried forward), 'Go thou forward, as the first of\nthese godward-going ones; the eye of the gods\n\np. 200\n\nand of mortals,'--for this (Agni) is indeed the eye of both gods and\nmen;--'they who love to sacrifice together with the Bh _ri_ gus,'--that is,\n'sacrificing together with the Bh _ri_ gus,'--'let the offerers go unto\nheaven, hail!'--that is, 'may the offerers go to the heavenly world, hail!'\n\n9:2:3:2929\\. Now, the gods thereby (viz. by these five verses) wrested from\nthe Asuras the five regions which are in yonder world, and then ascended them;\nand so does the Sacrificer thereby wrest them from his hateful enemy, and then\nascend them. And by means of them the gods attained thither, and so also does\nthis (Sacrificer) by means of them attain thither.\n\n9:2:3:3030\\. He then makes offering on that (firebrand);--for now that he\n(Agni) had arrived the gods thereupon gratified him with food, this oblation;\nand in like manner does this (Sacrificer), now that he (Agni) has arrived,\nthereupon gratify him with food, this oblation. With milk from a black (cow)\nwhich has a white calf (he makes offering); the black (cow) with a white calf\nis the night, and her calf is yonder sun: he thus regales him with his own\nshare, with his own relish. On it (the firebrand, he offers) while it is held\nabove (the naturally-perforated brick); for above (everything) is he whom he\nthereby gratifies. By means of the milk-pail (he offers), for with the milk-\npail milk is given away.\n\n9:2:3:3131\\. And, again, as to why he makes offering upon it. That (\xc3\x82havaniya)\nfire is the head of the sacrifice, and milk means breath: he thus puts breath\ninto the head. He should make the offering so that it (the milk) flows on the\nnaturally-perforated (brick);--the naturally-perforated one is breath, and\nthis\n\np. 201\n\n[paragraph continues] (milk) is vital sap: he thus connects and puts together\nthe head and the breath by means of vital sap. [He pours it out, with, Va _g_.\nS. XVII, 70, 71], 'Night and Dawn, of one mind, unlike in form,'--the meaning\nof this has been explained 1.\n\n9:2:3:3232\\. 'O Agni, thousand-eyed!--through the chips of gold 2 Agni is\nindeed thousand-eyed;--hundred-headed,'--inasmuch as, at that time 3, he was\ncreated as the hundred-headed Rudra;--'thine are a hundred out-breathings, and\na thousand through-breathings,'--his indeed are a hundred out-breathings and a\nthousand through-breathings who is hundred-headed and thousand-eyed;--'thou\nart the master of wealth,'--that is, 'thou art the master of all wealth;'--'to\nthee, our strength, do we give honour!'--he (Agni) is indeed the strength 4:\nit is him he thereby gratifies.\n\n9:2:3:3333\\. With two (verses) he makes offering thereon,--two-footed is the\nSacrificer, and the Sacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is\nhis measure, with so much he thus makes offering to him.\n\n9:2:3:3434\\. He then lays it (the firebrand) down, with (Va _g_. S. XVII, 72,\n73), 'A well-winged bird thou art,'--for on that former occasion he, by means\nof the fashioning-formula, fashions him into a well-winged bird 5; that well-\nwinged bird he builds up, and having fashioned that well-winged bird, he\nfinally sets him down;--'seat thee on the back\n\np. 202\n\nof the earth, fill the air with thy shine, prop the sky with thy light, and\nuphold the quarters by thy lustre!'--for that one (Agni) indeed does all this.\n\n9:2:3:3535\\. 'Receiving offering, kind-faced, in front,'--that is, 'receiving\noffering, kind-faced for us, in front;'--'seat thee, O Agni, aright in thine\nown seat!'--for this (fire-altar) is his (Agni's) own seat: thus, 'do thou\nrightly seat thee in it!'--'in this higher abode,'--the higher abode,\ndoubtless, is the sky;--'sit ye down, the All-gods and the Sacrificer!'--he\nthus establishes the Sacrificer together with the All-gods. With two (verses)\nhe deposits it: the significance of this has been explained,--with the Vasha\n_t_ -call: the significance of this (will be explained) farther on.\n\n9:2:3:3636\\. He then puts pieces of firewood thereon; for now that he (Agni)\nhad arrived, the gods thereupon gratified him with food, both pieces of\nfirewood and oblations; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), now that he\nhas arrived, thereupon gratify him with food, both pieces of wood and\noblations.\n\n9:2:3:3737\\. He first puts on one of _s_ ami-wood (acacia suma). For at that\ntime, when this oblation had been offered, he (Agni) was enkindled and blazed\nup. The gods were afraid of him, lest he might injure them. They saw this _s_\nami tree, and therewith appeased him; and inasmuch as they appeased ( _s_ am)\nhim by that _s_ ami, it is (called) _S_ ami; and in like manner this\n(Sacrificer) now appeases him by means of that _s_ ami (wood),--just with a\nview to appeasement, not for food.\n\n9:2:3:3838\\. [He puts it on, with, Va _g_. S. XVII, 74], 'I desire the\nmanifest favour of the admirable\n\np. 203\n\n[paragraph continues] Savit _ri_ , enjoyed by all men; that great cow of his,\nthe thousand-streamed, teeming with milk, which Ka _n_ va was wont to milk;'--\nfor Ka _n_ va indeed saw her, and she, the thousand-streamed, milked him all\nhis wishes (objects of desire); and in like manner does the thousand-streamed\none now milk to the Sacrificer all his objects of desire.\n\n9:2:3:3939\\. He then puts on one of vika\xe1\xb9\x85kata (flacourtia sapida) wood--the\nsignificance whereof has been explained--with (Va _g_. S. XVII, 75), 'To thee\ngive we honour, O Agni, in the highest home;'--his highest home, doubtless, is\nthe sky;--'to thee give we honour, in hymns of praise, in the lower abode;'--\nthe lower abode, doubtless, is the air;--'the birth-place whence thou hast\narisen do I worship,'--that is, 'this is his (Agni's) own birth-place: that I\nworship;'--'on thee, when kindled, offerings are poured forth;'--for when he\n(the fire) is kindled, they make offerings on him.\n\n9:2:3:4040\\. He then puts on one of udumbara (ficus glomerata) wood;--the\nUdumbara means strength and sap: with strength and sap he thus gratifies him.\nIt has forking branches 1,--forking branches mean cattle: with cattle, as\nfood, he thus gratifies him. If he cannot get one with bifurcate branches, let\nhim take up a globule of sour curds and put it on (the wood): that globule of\nsour curds which supervenes is a form of cattle. With the vira _g_ (verse, Va\n_g_. S. XVII, 76; _Ri_ g-veda VII, I, 3),\n\np. 204\n\n[paragraph continues] 'Kindled, blaze forth, O Agni, before us, (with\ninexhaustible flame, O youngest! perpetual viands accrue unto thee!)'--he puts\nit on;--the Vira _g_ means food: with food he thus gratifies him. Three pieces\nof wood he puts on,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is\nhis measure, with so much food he thus gratifies him.\n\n9:2:3:4141\\. He then offers oblations,--this is just as if, after serving food\nto some one, one gives him something to drink. With the dipping-spoon (sruva)\nhe offers the first two, with the offering-ladle (sru _k_ ) the last\n(oblation); (the first) with (Va _g_. S. XVII, 77), 'O Agni, may we, with\nhymns and thoughts, speed this day this (sacrifice) of thine, even as a steed,\nas a noble, heart-stirring deed!'--that is, 'whatever heart-stirring hymn is\nthine, may I speed (perform) that for thee.' With a pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti (verse) he offers,\n--of five feet consists the Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti, of five layers the fire-altar, five\nseasons are a year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is\nhis measure, with so much food he thus gratifies him.\n\n9:2:3:4242\\. He then offers (the second oblation), the one for Vi _s_\nvakarman,--Vi _s_ vakarman (the all-worker) is this Agni: it is him he thereby\ngratifies,--with (Va _g_. S. XVII, 78), 'Thought I offer, with mind and ghee,'\n--that is, 'The thought of these (priests and Sacrificer) I offer with mind\nand ghee;'--'that the gods come hither,'--that is, 'that the gods may come\nhither;'--'enjoying their offering-meal, the holy-minded,'--that is, the true-\nminded;--'to Vi _s_ vakarman, the lord of all existence, I offer,'--that is,\n'to that Vi _s_ vakarman who is the lord of all that here exists I\noffer;'--'every day the\n\np. 205\n\nunimpaired oblation,'--that is, 'always the uninjured oblation.'\n\n9:2:3:4343\\. He then offers a full (-spoon) oblation,--the full means\neverything: with everything he thus gratifies him.\n\n9:2:3:4444\\. [He offers, with, Va _g_. S. XVII, 79], Thine, O Agni, are seven\nlogs,'--logs mean vital airs, for the vital airs do kindle him;--'seven\ntongues,'--this he says with regard to those seven persons which they made\ninto one person 1;--'seven _Ri_ shis,'--for seven _Ri_ shis they indeed\nwere;--'seven beloved seats,'--this he says with regard to the metres, for his\nseven beloved seats are the metres;--'sevenfold the seven priests worship\nthee,'--for in a sevenfold way the seven priests indeed worship him;--'the\nseven homes,'--he thereby means the seven layers (of the altar);--'fill thou!'\n--that is, 'generate thou;'--'with ghee,'--ghee means seed: he thus lays seed\ninto these worlds;--'svaha!'--the svaha (hail!) is the sacrifice; he thus at\nonce makes everything here fit for sacrifice.\n\n9:2:3:4545\\. 'Seven' he says each time,--of seven layers the fire-altar\nconsists, and of seven seasons the year, and Agni is the year: as great as\nAgni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus gratifies him. Three\noblations he offers,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is\nhis measure, with so much food he thus gratifies him. Three logs he puts on,--\nthat makes six: the significance of this has been explained.\n\n9:2:3:4646\\. Standing he puts on the logs,--the logs are bones, and bones\nstand, so to speak. Sitting he\n\np. 206\n\noffers the oblations,--oblations are the flesh, and the flesh sits (lies), so\nto speak. The logs are inside (the fire), and the oblations outside, for the\nbones are inside, and the flesh is outside.\n\n9:2:3:4747\\. Now, then, as to the (mystic) correspondence (or, amount). Six he\noffers before (the leading forward of the fire), and six afterwards; with six\n(formulas) they proceed up to the variegated stone; with two he lays down the\nvariegated stone; with four they proceed as far as the fire-altar; with five\nthey mount the fire-altar: that makes twenty-nine, and the oblation itself is\nthe thirtieth. With two (verses) he deposits the fire,--that makes thirty-two,\nand of thirty-two syllables consists the Anush _t_ ubh: such, then, is this\nAnush _t_ ubh.\n\n9:2:3:4848\\. And this one (Anush _t_ ubh) they bring hither from those three\nAnush _t_ ubhs which they make up on the Garhapatya 1; and inasmuch as they\nbring this (therefrom) hither, thereby this whole Agni (fire-altar) becomes\ncompleted. But now he was not yet fit to eat food 2.\n\n9:2:3:4949\\. He said to Agni 3, 'By thee I will eat food!'--So be it!' Hence\nit is only when they bring him hither, that this ( _k_ ityagni) becomes fit to\neat food, to eat oblations.\n\n9:2:3:5050\\. Moreover, they say, 'It is Pra _g_ apati himself who takes this\n(Agni) as his dear son to his bosom;' and verily, whosoever so knows this,\ntakes thus a dear son to his bosom.\n\np. 207\n\n9:2:3:5151\\. And, again, as to why they bring it here,--the Agni (fire-altar)\nwhich is built up here is the same as those seven persons which they made into\none person; and that excellence and life-sap of them which they concentrated\nabove, that is the fire which they now bring here,--hence, when they now bring\nit here, they concentrate above (in the head) that excellence and life-sap\nwhich belonged to those seven persons,--that is his (Agni's) head, and this\nbuilt-up fire-altar is the body: having thus completed his body, he restores\nthe head to it.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[191:1](sbe4334.htm#fr_328) Viz. a burning piece of wood taken from the\nGarhapatya hearth to serve as the new \xc3\x82havaniya on the great fire-altar. The\nGarhapatya fire, it will be remembered, was the Ukhya Agni, or the sacred fire\ncarried in a pan (ukha) by the Sacrificer during his time of initiation\n(diksha) lasting for a year (or some other definite period), till, at the end\nof that period, at the beginning of the Praya _n_ iya, or opening-offering, it\nwas transferred from the pan to the newly-built Garhapatya hearth.\n\n[193:1](sbe4334.htm#fr_330) The trish _t_ ubh verse consists of 4 \xc3\x97 11\nsyllables, hence the twelve verses of together 528 syllables. The gayatri\nverse, on the other hand, consists of 3 \xc3\x97 8 syllables; and twenty-two such\nverses would thus consist of altogether 528 syllables.\n\n[193:2](sbe4334.htm#fr_331) Viz. VI, 8, 1, 7.\n\n[194:1](sbe4334.htm#fr_332) Mahidhara takes ' _s_ amita' to stand for ' _s_\namitra.'\n\n[195:1](sbe4334.htm#fr_333) ? Or, 'May they favour our prayers and blessings!'\nThese verses are rather enigmatical.\n\n[195:2](sbe4334.htm#fr_334) The author of the Brahma _n_ a connects 'udaya _m_\n' with 'yam,' Mahidhara with 'ya' (udayan for udayat).\n\n[195:3](sbe4334.htm#fr_335) ? Or, reach _that_ place; Saya _n_ a, in the first\ninstance, takes it to mean 'as far as this place' (from beyond the sun down to\nthe end of the air); but in the second instance, he takes it as referring to\nthe particular spot on the sacrificial ground near which this part of the\nceremonial is performed, viz. the \xc3\x82gnidhra's fire-shed (as representing the\nair), south of which the Adhvaryu lays down a variegated stone close to the\n'spine.'\n\n[196:1](sbe4334.htm#fr_336) That is, where the \xc3\x82gnidhra shed and hearth will\nafterwards have to be erected (see [IX, 4, 3,\n5](sbe4341.htm#9:4:3:5)-[6](sbe4341.htm#9:4:3:6)) on the northern edge of the\nVedi, midway between the Garhapatya and \xc3\x82havaniya fire-places.\n\n[197:1](sbe4334.htm#fr_337) Thus Mahidhara here takes 'purva,' and apparently\nalso the author of the Brahma _n_ a; the easterly father being the \xc3\x82havaniya,\nand hence the sky. In the formula it would rather seem to mean former, old.'\n\n[197:2](sbe4334.htm#fr_338) See [VIII, 7, 3, 7](sbe4328.htm#8:7:3:7).\n\n[198:1](sbe4334.htm#fr_339) Viz. inasmuch as the firebrand now being carried\nforward to the great fire-altar, where it is henceforth to serve as \xc3\x82havaniya,\nwas taken from the Garhapatya fire, which itself is identical with the Ukhya\nAgni, or fire carried about by the Sacrificer in the Ukha, or pan, during his\nperiod of initiation. See [p. 191](sbe4333.htm#page_191), note 1.\n\n[199:1](sbe4334.htm#fr_340) Mahidhara takes 'puro'gni' in the sense of fore-\ngoer (puras agre a\xe1\xb9\x85gati ga _k_ _kh_ ati).\n\n[199:2](sbe4334.htm#fr_341) That is, according to Mahidhara, they think not of\ntheir sons, cattle, &c.\n\n[199:3](sbe4334.htm#fr_342) Thus Mahidhara takes 'vi _s_ vatodhara;' 'flowing\nin every direction' (vi _s_ vato + dhara), St. Petersb. Dict.\n\n[201:1](sbe4334.htm#fr_343) Viz. VI, 7, 2, 2.\n\n[201:2](sbe4334.htm#fr_344) See [IX, 2, 1, 1](sbe4332.htm#9:2:1:1).\n\n[201:3](sbe4334.htm#fr_345) See [IX, 1, 1, 6](sbe4330.htm#9:1:1:6).\n\n[201:4](sbe4334.htm#fr_346) ? Or, that (firebrand) is indeed food (va _g_ a).\nMahidhara interprets this part of the formula thus: To thee do we give food\n(va _g_ aya for va _g_ am).\n\n[201:5](sbe4334.htm#fr_347) See VI, 7, 2, 5 seq.\n\n[203:1](sbe4334.htm#fr_348) Weber, Ind. Stud. XIII, 281, takes 'kar _n_\nakavat' to mean 'one that has a knot-hole;' but Deva's explanation, 'kar _n_\nako dvitiya _s_ akhodbheda _h_ ,' probably means nothing else than 'showing\nthe appearance of a second branch,' or 'one in which a second branch (side\nbranch) has struck out.'\n\n[205:1](sbe4334.htm#fr_349) See VI, 1, 1, 1 seq.\n\n[206:1](sbe4334.htm#fr_350) See VII, 1, 2, 16-19.\n\n[206:2](sbe4334.htm#fr_351) Literally, he was not equal thereto that he should\neat food.\n\n[206:3](sbe4334.htm#fr_352) That is, the _K_ ityagni (fire-altar) said to the\nAgni (fire) about to be led forward.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IX, 3, 1.
