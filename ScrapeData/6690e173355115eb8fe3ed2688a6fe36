(The chief pra _n_ a is) neither air nor function, on account of its being\nmentioned separately.\n\np. 86\n\nAn inquiry is now started concerning the nature of that chief pra _n_ a.--The\npurvapakshin maintains that the pra _n_ a is, according to _S_ ruti, nothing\nbut air. For _S_ ruti says, 'Breath is air; that air assuming five forms is\npra _n_ a, apana, vyana, udana, samana.'--Or else the purvapaksha may be\nformulated according to the view of another philosophical doctrine, and pra\n_n_ a may be considered as the combined function of all organs. For so the\nfollowers of another doctrine (viz. the Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khyas) teach, 'The five airs, pra\n_n_ a, &c., are the common function of the instruments 1.'\n\nTo this we reply that the pra _n_ a is neither air nor the function of an\norgan; for it is mentioned separately. From air pra _n_ a is distinguished in\nthe following passage, 'Breath indeed is the fourth foot of Brahman. That foot\nshines as Agni with its light and warms.' If pra _n_ a were mere air, it would\nnot be mentioned separately from air.--Thus it is also mentioned separately\nfrom the functions of the organs; for the texts enumerate speech and the other\norgans and mention pra _n_ a separately from them, and the function and that\nto which the function belongs (the organ) are identical. If it were a mere\nfunction of an organ, it would not be mentioned separately from the organs.\nOther passages also in which the pra _n_ a is mentioned separately from air\nand the organs are here to be considered so, e.g. 'From him is born breath,\nmind, and all organs of sense, ether, air,' &c. (Mu. Up. II, 1, 3). Nor is it\npossible that all the organs together should have one function (and that that\nfunction should be the pra _n_ a); for each organ has its own special function\nand the aggregate of them has no active power of its own.--But--an objection\nmay be raised--the thing may take place in the manner of the moving bird-cage.\nJust as eleven birds shut up in one cage may, although each makes a separate\neffort, move the cage by the combination of their efforts; so the eleven\n\np. 87\n\npra _n_ as which abide in one body may, although each has its own special\nfunction, by the combination of these functions, produce one common function\ncalled pra _n_ a.--This objection, we reply, is without force. The birds\nindeed may, by means of their separate subordinate efforts, which all favour\nthe movement of the cage, move the cage by combination; that is a matter of\nobservation. But we have no right to assume that the different pra _n_ as with\ntheir subordinate functions such as hearing &c. can, by combination, produce\nthe function of vital breath; for there is no means to prove this, and the\nvital breath is in kind absolutely different from hearing and so on.--\nMoreover, if the vital breath were the mere function of an organ (or the\norgans) it could not be glorified as the 'best,' and speech and so on could\nnot be represented as subordinate to it. Hence the vital breath is different\nfrom air and the functions (of the organs).--How then have we to understand\nthe scriptural passage, 'The pra _n_ a is air,' &c.?--The air, we reply,\npassing into the adhyatma-state, dividing itself fivefold and thus abiding in\na specialized condition is called pra _n_ a. It therefore is neither a\ndifferent being nor is it mere air. Hence there is room for those passages as\nwell which identify it with air as those which do not.--Well, let this be\ngranted. The pra _n_ a then also must be considered to be independent in this\nbody like the individual soul, as scripture declares it to be the 'best' and\nthe organs such as speech, &c., to be subordinate to it. For various powers\nare ascribed to it in scriptural passages. It is said, for instance, that when\nspeech and the other (organs) are asleep the pra _n_ a alone is awake; that\nthe pra _n_ a alone is not reached by death; that the pra _n_ a is the\nabsorber, it absorbs speech, &c.; that the pra _n_ a guards the other senses\n(pra _n_ as) as a mother her sons 1. Hence it follows that the pra _n_ a is\nindependent in the same way as the individual soul.--This view is impugned in\nthe next Sutra.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[86:1](sbe38063.htm#fr_56) Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya Su.
