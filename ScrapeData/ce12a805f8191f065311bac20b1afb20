I  \nWill pass into the fire and die.  \nAbandoned thus, I will not brook  \nUpon Ayodhya's town to look,  \nOnce guarded by Ikshvaku's race:  \nThe wood shall be my dwelling place.'  \n\nThen when the princes' mournful train  \nHeard the sad brothers thus complain,  \nAnd saw their misery, at the view  \nTheir grief burst wilder out anew.  \nFaint with lamenting, sad and worn,  \nEach like a bull with broken horn,  \nThe brothers in their wild despair  \nLay rolling, mad with misery, there.  \nThen old Vas'ishtha good and true,  \nTheir father's priest, all lore who knew,  \nRaised weeping Bharat on his feet,  \nAnd thus bespake with counsel meet:  \n'Twelve days, my lord, have past away  \n\np. 187  \n\nSince flames consumed thy father's clay:  \nDelay no more: as rules ordain,  \nGather what bones may yet remain.  \nThree constant pairs are ever found  \nTo hem all mortal creatures round:  [1](ry156.htm#fn_354)  \nThen mourn not thus, O Prince, for none  \nTheir close companionship may shun.'  \n   Sumantra bade S'atrughna rise,  \nAnd soothed his soul with counsel wise,  \nAnd skilled in truth, his hearer taught  \nHow all things are and come to naught,  \nWhen rose each hero from the ground,  \nA lion lord of men, renowned,  \nHe showed like Indra's flag, [2](ry156.htm#fn_355) whereon  \nFierce rains have dashed and suns have shone.  \nThey wiped their red and weeping eyes,  \nAnd gently made their sad replies:  \nThen, urged to haste, the royal pair  \nPerformed the rites that claimed their care.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[186:1](ry154.htm#fr_352) The Sama-veda, the hymns of which are chanted aloud.\n\n[186:2](ry154.htm#fr_353) Walking from right to left.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXXVIII.: Manthara Punished.](ry156.htm)\n\n"
