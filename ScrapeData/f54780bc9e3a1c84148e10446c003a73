Is it not lying on\nmother\'s lap, and looking up into her eyes, and laughing?\n\nDid you ever play hide and seek with mother? Mother\'s eyes shut, and baby was\nnot. She opened them, and there was baby! Then baby\'s eyes shut, and where was\nmother? But they opened again, and--oh!\n\nWhen mother\'s eyes were shut, where was she? There all the time? But you could\nnot see her eyes. Yet she was there.\n\nBaby, some people think God is just like that. A great great Mother--so great\nthat all this big world is Her baby. God is playing with Her world, and She\nshuts Her eyes. Then, all our lives long, baby darling, we try to catch the\nGreat Mother peeping. And if any of us can do that, if any of us can look into\nthe eyes of God, just once, just for a minute,--do you know what happens? . .\n. That person at once knows all secrets, and he\n\np. 108\n\nbecomes strong and wise and loving, and he never, never forgets that moment.\n\nAnd when you win like that, when you catch the Mother looking, something else\nhappens. Something lovely. All Her other children come and play with you. The\nlittle birds come, and the wee lambs love you, and the wild rabbits touch your\nfeet, and the poor children in the streets, who are cold and hungry perhaps--\npoor children that the Great Mother loves most of all, because they seem to\nhave no father or mother, and perhaps no home--poor children trust you, and\nmake a place for you with them. We are all sitting on the Mother\'s lap, but\nthese sit closest of all to Her breast.\n\nAnd what do we call the Mother with Her eyes shut? We call her Kali.\n\n.      .      .      .      .      .\n\nWere you ever for a very few minutes, unhappy? And did mother, or nurse, or\nauntie, or someone else, come and pick you\n\np. 109\n\nup, and love you, and kiss you, till you were not unhappy any more?\n\nSometimes God is like that too. We get so frightened because those eyes will\nnot open. We want to stop the game. We don\'t like it. We feel alone, and far\naway and lost. Then we cry out. It has grown quite dark, and still the\nMother\'s eyes are shut. Let us play no longer. So we feel some-times.\n\nBut the eyes are not shut, really. We think so, because it is dark all round.\nJust at that moment when you cried out, the beautiful eyes of the Mother\nopened and looked at Her child like two deep wells of love. And you, if you\nhad seen, would have stopped playing all at once, and saying "Kali! Kali!" you\nwould have hidden your little face on the Mother\'s shoulder, and listened to\nthe beating of her heart instead!\n\nAnd so, wee one, will you remember that the Great Mother Kali is everywhere?\nEven when\n\np. 110\n\nthe seems to be far away, it is only that you cannot see Her eyes. _This_\nmother goes away, and you cannot see her. But Kali is always there, always\nloving, and always ready to play with Her child.\n\nAnd will you sometimes remember to stop playing, just for a minute, and to\nfold your little hands, and say, "Dear Mother Kali, let me see Your eyes!"\n\n.      .      .      .      .      .\n\nThere is another game of hide-and-seek that the Great Mother plays. This is\nmore like a fairy story. She hides sometimes in other people. She hides in\nanything. Any day you might see Her eyes, just looking into mother\'s, or\nplaying with a kitten, or picking up a bird that had fallen from its nest.\nUnder all these forms you may find God playing at hide-and-seek!\n\nWhen there is something to do for someone--Kali is calling us to play. We lave\nthat play. She Herself said once (She was hiding in someone, and He said it\nfor Her).\n\np. 111\n\n[paragraph continues] "Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of these,\nMy little ones, ye did it unto Me." Is not that like a fairy story! And what\nfunny places She, the Great Mother, can hide in! Another time She said " Lift\nthe stone, and thou shalt find Me. Cleave the wood, and there am I!" Did you\never lift a stone or break a piece of wood to see what was inside? Did you\never think _that_ was God--at the heart of things? How beautifully Kali plays!\nYou might find Her _any_ where!\n\n.      .      .      .      .      .\n\nDoes mother love baby when she is hiding from her? Why of course! else why\nshould she hide? Even when her eyes are shut, is Mother loving baby? Why yes,\nsee how she is laughing all the time!\n\nAnd so with Kali. We need never he frightened, though Her eyes are long shut.\nShe is laughing all the time. In Her own good time God will stop playing, and\nwe shall look into Her eyes, and get away and away behind the\n\np. 112\n\nworld--straight "to the other end of nowhere," all at once.\n\nSo let us always run to play when we are called. Remember, little one, if any\nneed anything you can give, your Mother is calling you to find Her! If anyone\nask for something you can do, it is really Mother saying "Peep childie!" or\nwhen a new person comes for you to love, Kali is saying "Here am I!"\n\n.      .      .      .      .      .\n\nThere is something else. You love mother and father and auntie and nurse,\nand--, and--. Of course you do. Besides, they love you, and they are all so\ngood and kind.\n\nBut far far away, mother has a brother, a big brother, like Holl. Do you love\nhim too? Why? You never saw him. He never played with you.\n\nNo, but mother loves him. And you love all the people mother loves--don\'t you\ndearie? And so we love all the people Kali loves. _All_ the children She plays\nwith, and the lambs, and the flowers, and the\n\np. 113\n\ngreat trees, and the little fishes. She loves all these, and She loves too the\nstars in the sky. And so do we. For we are Her children, and everything that\nShe loves we love too, because She is the Mother, and we cannot help it.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Kali the Mother](ktm09.htm)\n\n'
