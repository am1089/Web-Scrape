For (Brahman) is merely devoid of form, on account of this being the main\npurport of scripture.\n\nBrahman, we must definitively assert, is devoid of all form, colour, and so\non, and does not in any way possess form, and so on.--Why?--'On account of\nthis being the main purport (of scripture).'--' It is neither coarse nor fine,\nneither short nor long' (B _ri_. Up. III, 8, 8); 'That which is without sound,\nwithout touch, without form, without decay' (Ka. Up. I, 3, 15); 'He who is\ncalled ether is the revealer of all forms and names. That within which forms\nand names are, that is Brahman' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 14, 1); 'That heavenly\nperson is without body, he is both without and within, not produced' (Mu. Up.\nII, 1, 2); 'That Brahman is without cause and without effect, without anything\ninside or outside, this Self is Brahman, omnipresent and omniscient' (B _ri_.\nUp. II, 5, 19). These and similar passages have for their purport the true\nnature of Brahman as non-connected with any world, and have not any other\npurport, as we have proved under I, 1, 4. On the ground of such passages we\ntherefore must definitively conclude that Brahman is devoid of form. Those\nother passages, on the other hand, which refer to a Brahman qualified by form\ndo not aim at setting forth the nature of Brahman, but rather at enjoining the\nworship of Brahman. As long as those latter texts do not contradict those of\nthe former class, they are to be accepted as they stand; where, however,\ncontradictions occur, the passages whose main subject is Brahman must be\nviewed as having greater force than those of the other kind.--This is the\nreason for our deciding that although there are two different classes of\nscriptural texts, Brahman must be held to be altogether without form, not\n\np. 156\n\nat the same time of an opposite nature.--But what then is the position of\nthose passages which refer to Brahman as possessing form?--To this question\nthe next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2, 15](sbe38118.htm)\n\n"
