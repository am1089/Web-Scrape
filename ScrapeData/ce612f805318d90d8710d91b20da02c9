The king Suratha said :-- \xc2\x93O Muni! This Vais\xc2\x92ya is now become a friend of\nmine in this forest; he has been expelled from his home by his sons and wife\nand he has come lately here in this forest. He is now suffering very much from\nthe bereavement of his family and has become very much troubled in his mind.\nHe is not getting any peace whatsoever. I am also become like him and have\nbecome very distressed owing to my kingdom being robbed away. This thought,\nthough really devoid of any substantial cause, is not leaving my heart now.\nOh! My elephants and horses, now under my enemies, have become weak; My\nservants are suffering very much owing to my absence! My enemies will, within\nno time squander away forcibly all my hoarded riches. This thought is not\ngiving me any happiness; nay, I cannot get any sleep owing to this care and\nanxiety. O Lord! I know that this world is false as a dream; yet my mind is so\ndeluded that I cannot make me quiet. Who am I? What are those horses and\nelephants to me? They are not my brothers, sons, nor friends; yet I feel very\nmuch for them and am troubled with\n\n\n\np. 470\n\n\n\ntheir troubles. O Muni! I know these all are delusions; still I am not able to\nmake my mind free from them. This is very wonderful indeed! What is the cause\nof all this? O Lord! Nothing is veiled from your sight, you are fully able to\nsolve all these doubts. Therefore, O Ocean of mercy! Kindly explain to me and\nthis Vais\xc2\x92ya the cause of all this delusion.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n9\\. Vyasa said :-- O King! When the King Suratha asked thus, the Muni in reply\nsaid to him the following words, full of wisdom, so that his delusion and\nsorrow might vanish.\n\n\n\n10-25. The Muni said :-- \xc2\x93O King! I am telling you the cause of bondage as\nwell the cause of release of all the beings in this Universe. She is known as\nMaha Maya. She is the Mula Prakriti, the state of equilibrium of the three Gu\n_n_ as, Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. Even Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, Mahes\xc2\x92vara, Indra,\nVaru _n_ a, Vayu, and the other Devas, Gandarbhas, Nagas, Rak _s_ asas, men,\ndeer, animals, birds, trees and various kinds of creepers all are under Maya;\nthus they are all bound; again they all get release when they are released by\nthat Maya. By Her is created all this world, moving and not moving, all the\nbeings are caught in Her net and all are under the control of Her. You are a K\n_s_ attriya; so Rajogu _n_ a preponderates in you and your heart is thus\nrendered impure. She, by Her Maya, deludes even the minds of those who are\nJ\xc3\xb1anins or wise; you are but an ordinary man compared to them. Even Brahma, Vi\n_sn_ u and Mahes\xc2\x92a, though possessed of vast wisdom, still roam, under the\nsway of Maya, in the three worlds completely deluded by their attachments to\nthe sensual objects. O King! In the Satya Yuga, in ancient times Vi _sn_ u\nNaraya _n_ a himself performed a very hard tapasya in S\xc2\x92vetadvipa. He passed\naway full ten thousand years in meditation, with the object of attaining the\nunbroken everlasting Bliss and becoming steadfastly attached to Brahma Vidya.\nO King! Brahma, too, became engaged in performing a tapasya, meditating the\nPrimordial Force, \xc3\x82dya S\xc2\x92akti, in a very wonderful solitary place for the\ncessation of delusion. Once on a time Vasudeva Hari wanted to go to another\nplace; he got up and started to see other places. Brahma, also, left his place\nand started for another destination. When they met each other in their way,\neach one asked the other, \xc2\x93Who are you?\xc2\x94 The Prajapati answered :-- \xc2\x93I am the\nCreator Brahma.\xc2\x94 Hearing thus the Brahma\xc2\x92s words, Vi _sn_ u said :-- \xc2\x93O You\nStupid! I am Achyuta Vi _sn_ u; therefore I am the Creator of this world. You\nare inferior to Me as there is so much of Rajogu _n_ a in preponderance in\nyou. Know Me as the eternal Vasudeva, preponderating in Sattva Gu _n_ a. Do\nyou not remember that I fought a dreadful battle for you and thus saved your\nlife a short while ago, I slew the two Danavas Madhu and Kai _t_ ava\n\n\n\np. 471\n\n\n\nwhen you were much distressed by them and took My refuge. How then do you\nboast now! O Fool! Quit your this vain boasting now. In this wide world, there\nis none superior to Me.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n26-31. The Ri _s_ i said :-- Thus engaged in disputing with each other, their\nlips were quivering with anger and their eyes got red. When, Behold! there\nappeared suddenly between those two disputants, a nectar-like white phallic\nemblem (Lingam), wonderfully long and extensive. Then a voice, from without\nanybody, broke out in the Heavens and addressed Brahma and Vi _sn_ u who were\nquarrelling thus! Whoever amongst you will be able to go to the other end of\nthis Lingam whether beyond its top or below its bottom, he is certainly the\nsuperior of you two; let one of you therefore go down to Patala and let the\nother go up to the Heavens. Leave off your useless disputations and take my\nword as proof. It is always advisable to select an umpire to decide such a\nquarrel as this that has sprung up between you two.\n\n\n\n32-39. The Ri _s_ i said :-- O King! Hearing thus the divine word, both of\nthem became ready and began energetically to measure the length of the\nwonderful Lingam that stood in front of them. Vi _sn_ u went down to Patala\nand Brahma went up to \xc3\x82kas\xc2\x92a to measure the Lingam and thus to ascertain their\nsuperiority. Going down some distance Vi _sn_ u got tired and doing his best,\nwhen he could not find out the end of the Lingam, he returned and remained at\nthe desired meeting place. On the other hand, Brahma was ascending to the\nskies when he got one Ketaki flower dropping from the head of the Lingam. He\nbecame over glad and returned also to the desired meeting place. Brahma became\nvery much elated with vanity and when he returned, he at once showed that\nflower to Vi _sn_ u and spoke thus the false words :-- \xc2\x93O Vi _sn_ u! This\nKetaki flower has been obtained from the head of the Lingam. I have brought\nthis to you simply that you would recognise it and be convinced in your\nheart.\xc2\x94 Hearing these words of Brahma, Vi _sn_ u saw the Ketaki flower and\nsaid :-- \xc2\x93O Brahma! Who is your witness in this matter? He whose words are\ntrue, who is equal to all, who is intelligent, pure, and always of good\nconduct, he can be the witness in such matters of dispute.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n40-44. Brahma said :-- \xc2\x93Who will come now as witness from that far off place?\nThis Ketaki flower is the witness; this will give evidence.\xc2\x94 Thus saying,\nBrahma requested Ketaki to give evidence; Ketaki soon replied thus to convince\nVi _sn_ u. O Vi _sn_ u! I was on the head of Mahadeva; Brahma has brought me\nfrom there down to this place; you ought not therefore to have any doubt on\nthis point. My word is the evidence; Brahma has gone to the other end of the\nLingam. Some devotee\n\n\n\np. 472\n\n\n\nof S\xc2\x92iva put me on His head and Brahma has got me down from there. Hearing\nthus the words of Ketaki, Vi _sn_ u was very much astonished and said this :--\n\xc2\x93I cannot trust your word; if Maha Deva comes and speaks this Himself, then I\ncan trust and take it as a proof.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n45-53. The Ri _s_ i said :-- O King! The eternal Maha Deva, hearing the words\nof Vi _sn_ u, spoke thus to Ketaki with great anger, \xc2\x93O Liar! Do not utter\nsuch false words; You dropped down from My head and Brahma while ascending up,\npicked you up on the way. Now as you have told a lie, I will never take you;\nyou are henceforth forsaken by Me.\xc2\x94 Brahma was then very much put to shame; he\nbowed down to Vi _sn_ u; Maha Deva, forsook the Ketaki flower from that date.\nO King! Such is the power of Maya; when Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and other wise\npersons are so self-deluded by Her, what need to speak of other ordinary\nmortals! See! Vi _sn_ u, the Lord of Lak _s_ mi, is self-deluded and is always\ndeceiving the Daityas for the welfare of the Devas, without any fear\nwhatsoever of the sin that he is thereby incurring. Though He is the Lord of\nall yet He has to take several incarnations in several wombs, forsaking the\npleasures of the Heavens and fighting with the Daityas. O King! Vi _sn_ u is\nomniscient and He is the Lord of this world; specially He is the only One,\nSupreme in the creation of the Gods. Now when Maya exercises such a powerful\ninfluence on Vi _sn_ u, what wonder is there that the other ordinary beings\nwould be deluded by Her? O King! That Highest Prakriti draws away violently\nthe hearts of the wise and drags them down into the ocean of world. That\nOmnipresent Bhagavati is ever the cause of bondage of all when She casts Her\nnet of delusion and She is again ever the cause of liberation when She imparts\nHer knowledge to them.\n\n\n\n54\\. The King said :-- O Brahma _n_! What is the nature of Her? and what is\nthe Supreme Force? What is the Cause of this creation? And where is Her\nhighest place? Kindly narrate all these to me.\n\n\n\n55-66. The Ri _s_ i said :-- O King! She is beginningless; therefore She had\nno origin at any time; that Highest Devi is Eternal and She is always the\nCause of all Causes. (How then can any other be powerful like Her). O King!\nShe resides in all the beings as the essential vital Force; deprived of that\nForce, every being is reduced to a dead carcass. She is pervading as the\nUniversal Force of Consciousness in all the beings. The form of this S\xc2\x92akti\n(Force) is the form made up of consciousness itself, the Brahma. (For the\nforce of Fire is Fire itself; it is not seen in any other form). Her\nappearances and disappearances at times are simply for serving the purposes of\nthe Gods. O King! Whenever the Devas and men worship Her, Ambika makes Her\nappearance visible to destroy their pains and sufferings. She assumes various\n\n\n\np. 473\n\n\n\nforms and possesses various powers. That Highest \xc3\x8es\xc2\x92vari comes down of Her\nfree will to serve Her some purpose or other. She is not like the Devas, under\nthe control of Daiva or Fate; She is not under the influence of Time (as both\nFate and Time are created by Her). She puts always every being to action\naccording to his capacity. Puru _s_ a is not the Doer; He is simply the\nWitness. This whole Universe is the object seen. That Devi is the Mother of\nall this that is witnessed. She is the Manifested and She is the Unmanifested\nand She is the Effect also. She alone is the Actress and manifests thus the\nworld and thus gives the colouring to the Puru _s_ a. When the Puru _s_ a is\ncoloured thus, She destroys quickly these worlds. It is said that Brahma, Vi\n_sn_ u and Mahes\xc2\x92a are respectively the Creator, Preserver and Destroyer of\nthe world; but this is merely a statement; really they are merely instruments\nin Her hands. Bhagavati has created them in reality for Her Pastime and\nstationed them in their respective posts. She has bestowed to them Her part\nmanifestations, i.e., Sarasvati to Brahma, Lak _s_ mi to Vi _sn_ u, and Girija\nto Mahes\xc2\x92a and has thus rendered them more powerful. They, the lords of the\nDevas, always meditate and worship Her as the Creatrix, Preservrix and\nDestructrix of this Universe. O King! I have thus described to you, as far as\nmy intelligence and knowledge go, the holy greatness and the excellent glory\nof Her (in reality, I have not been able to come to the end of it).\n\n\n\n\xc2\x93Aim Hrim Klim Chamu _nd_ ayai bichche\xc2\x94 is the (9) nine lettered mantra.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Thirty-third Chapter of the Fifth Book on the description of the\ngreatness of the Devi in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, the Maha Pura _n_ am, of\n18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 34](bk05ch34.htm)\n\n'
