(There takes place) a lighting up of the point of its (the soul's) abode\n(viz. the heart); the door (of its egress) being illuminated thereby; owing to\nthe power of knowledge and the application of meditation to the way which is\npart of that (knowledge); (the soul) favoured by him in the heart (viz.\nBrahman) (passes upwards) by the one that exceeds a hundred (i.e. by the\nhundred and first vein).\n\nHaving absolved the inquiry into a point of the higher knowledge into which we\nwere led by a special occasion, we now continue the discussion connected with\nthe lower knowledge.--It has been stated that up to the beginning of the way\nthe departure of him who knows and him who does not know is the same. The\npresent Sutra now describes the soul's entering on the way. The abode of the\nsoul, when--having taken within itself speech and the other powers--it is\nabout to depart, is the heart, according to the text, 'He taking with him\nthose elements of light descends into the heart' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 1). Of\nthe heart the point becomes lighted up, 'and subsequent to that is the\ndeparture of the soul, starting from the eye or some other place, according to\nthe passage, 'The point of his heart becomes lighted up, and by that light the\nSelf departs, either through the eye or through the skull or through other\nplaces of the body' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 2). The question here arises whether\nthat departure is the same for him who knows and him who does not know, or if\nthere is a special limitation in the case of the former; and the prima facie\nview might be upheld that there is no such limitation since scripture records\nno difference. Against this the teacher states that although, equally for him\nwho does know and him who does not know, the point of the heart becomes\nshining and the door of egress thereby\n\np. 378\n\nis lighted up, yet he who knows departs through the skull only, while the\nothers depart from other places.--Why so?--'On account of the power of\nknowledge.' If also he who knows departed, like all others, from any place of\nthe body, he would be unable to reach an exalted sphere; and then all\nknowledge would be purportless. 'And on account of the application of\nmeditation on the way forming a part of that.' That means: in different vidyas\nthere is enjoined meditation on the soul's travelling on the way connected\nwith the vein that passes through the skull;--which way forms a part of those\nvidyas. Now it is proper to conclude that he who meditates on that way should\nafter death proceed on it 1. Hence he who knows, being favoured by Brahman\nabiding in the heart on which he had meditated, and thus becoming like it in\nnature departs by the vein which passes through the skull and 'exceeds the\nhundred,' i.e. is the hundred and first. The souls of other men pass out by\nother veins. For thus scripture says, in a chapter treating of the knowledge\nof Brahman dwelling in the heart, 'There are a hundred and one veins of the\nheart; one of them penetrates the crown of the head; by that moving upwards a\nman reaches immortality; the others serve for departing in different\ndirections' (Kh, Up. VIII, 6, 5).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[378:1](sbe38297.htm#fr_222) For otherwise the meditation enjoined would be\n'ad _ri_ sh _t_ artha' only; an alternative not to be admitted anywhere as\nlong as a 'seen' purpose can be demonstrated.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 2, 18](sbe38298.htm)\n\n"
