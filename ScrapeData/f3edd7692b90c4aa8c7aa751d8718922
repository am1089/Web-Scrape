With the mind intent on Me, O son of Pritha, taking refuge in Me, and\npractising Yoga, how thou shalt without doubt know Me fully, that do thou\nhear. 1\n\np. 164\n\n2\\. I shall tell you in full, of knowledge, speculative and practical, knowing\nwhich, nothing more here remains to be known.\n\n3\\. One, perchance, in thousands of men, strives for perfection; and one\nperchance, among the blessed ones, striving thus, knows Me in reality. 3\n\np. 165\n\n4\\. Bhumi (earth), Ap (water), Anala (fire), Vayu (air), Kha (ether), mind,\nintellect, and egoism: thus is My Prakriti divided eight-fold. 4\n\np. 166\n\n5\\. This is the lower (Prakriti). But different from it, know thou, O mighty-\narmed, My higher Prakriti--the principle of self-consciousness, by which this\nuniverse is sustained.\n\n6\\. Know that these (two Prakritis) are the womb of all beings. I am the\norigin and dissolution of the whole universe. 6\n\np. 167\n\n7\\. Beyond Me, O Dhananjaya, there is naught. All this is strung in Me, as a\nrow of jewels on a thread. 7\n\n8\\. I am the sapidity in waters, O son of Kunti; I, the radiance in the moon\nand the sun; I am the Om in all the Vedas, sound in Akasha, and manhood in\nmen. 8\n\np. 168\n\n9\\. I am the sweet fragrance in earth, and the brilliance in fire am I; the\nlife in all beings, and the austerity am I in ascetics.\n\n10\\. Know Me, O son of Pritha, as the eternal seed of all beings. I am the\nintellect of the intelligent, and the heroism of the heroic.\n\np. 169\n\n11\\. Of the strong, I am the strength devoid of desire and attachment. I am, O\nbull among the Bharatas, desire in beings, unopposed to Dharma. 11\n\n12\\. And whatever states pertaining to Sattva, and those pertaining to Rajas,\nand to Tamas, know them to proceed from Me alone; still I am not in them, but\nthey are in Me. 12\n\np. 170\n\n13\\. Deluded by these states, the modifications of the three Gunas (of\nPrakriti), all this world does not know Me, beyond them, and immutable.\n\n14\\. Verily, this divine illusion of Mine, constituted of the Gunas, is\ndifficult to cross over; those who devote themselves to Me alone, cross over\nthis illusion. 14\n\np. 171\n\n15\\. They do not devote themselves to Me,--the evil-doers, the deluded, the\nlowest of men, deprived of discrimination by Maya, and following the way of\nthe Asuras. 15\n\np. 172\n\n16\\. Four kinds of virtuous men worship Me, O Arjuna,--the distressed, the\nseeker of knowledge, the seeker of enjoyment, and the wise, O bull among the\nBharatas. 16\n\n17\\. Of them, the wise man, ever-steadfast, (and fired) with devotion to the\nOne, excels; for supremely dear am I to the wise, and he is dear to Me.\n\np. 173\n\n18\\. Noble indeed are they all, but the wise man I regard as My very Self; for\nwith the mind steadfast, he is established in Me alone, as the supreme goal.\n\n19\\. At the end of many births, the man of wisdom takes refuge in Me,\nrealising that all this is Vasudeva (the innermost Self). Very rare is that\ngreat soul.\n\n20\\. Others again, deprived of discrimination by this or that desire,\nfollowing this or that rite, devote themselves to other gods, led by their own\nnatures. 20\n\np. 174\n\n21\\. Whatsoever form any devotee seeks to worship with Shraddha,--that\nShraddha of his do I make unwavering.\n\n22\\. Endued with that Shraddha, he engages in the worship of that, and from\nit, gains his desires,--these being verily dispensed by Me alone.\n\np. 175\n\n23\\. But the fruit (accruing) to these men of little understanding is limited.\nThe worshippers of the Devas go to the Devas; My devotees too come to me. 23\n\n24\\. The foolish regard Me, the un-manifested, as come into manifestation, not\nknowing My supreme state,--immutable and transcendental. 24\n\np. 176\n\n25\\. Veiled by the illusion born of the congress of the Gunas, I am not\nmanifest to all. This deluded world knows Me not, the Unborn, the Immutable.\n25\n\n26\\. I know, O Arjuna, the beings of the whole past, and the present, and the\nfuture, but Me none knoweth.\n\np. 177\n\n27\\. By the delusion of the pairs of opposites, arising from desire and\naversion, O descendant of Bharata, all beings fall into delusion at birth, O\nscorcher of foes. 27\n\n28\\. Those men of virtuous deeds, whose sin has come to an end,--they, freed\nfrom the delusion of the pairs of opposites, worship Me with firm resolve.\n\np. 178\n\n29\\. Those who strive for freedom from old age and death, taking refuge in Me,\nthey know. Brahman, the whole of Adhyatma, and Karma in its entirety. 29\n\n30\\. Those who know Me with the Adhibhuta, the Adhidaiva, and the Adhiyajna,\n(continue to) know Me even at the time of death, steadfast in mind. 30\n\n\n\nThe end of the seventh chapter, designated The Way of Knowledge with\nRealisation.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[163:1](sbg12.htm#fr_161) _Fully_ , _i.e._ , possessed of infinite greatness,\nstrength, power, grace, and other infinite attributes.\n\n[164:3](sbg12.htm#fr_162) _The Blessed:_ Siddhanam--this word literally means\nthe perfected ones--but here it means only those who having acquired good\nKarma in a past incarnation, strive for freedom in this life.\n\n[165:4](sbg12.htm#fr_163) The _raison d 'etre_ of this reduction of matter\ninto five elements is quite different from that conceived by modern science.\nMan has five senses only, just five ways in which he can be affected by\nmatter, therefore his perception of matter cannot be divided further. The five\nelements are of two kinds, subtle and gross. The gross state is said 'to be\nformed by taking half of a subtle element, and adding \xe2\x85\x9bth to it, of each of\nthe rest: _e.g._ , gross Akasha = \xc2\xbd subtle Akasha + \xe2\x85\x9bth subtle Vayu + \xe2\x85\x9bth\nsubtle Tejas + \xe2\x85\x9bth subtle Ap + \xe2\x85\x9bth subtle Bhumi: Then again, the ether, air,\nlight, water, and earth of modern science, do not answer to the five elements\nof Hindu philosophy. Akasha is just the sound-producing agency. From Akasha\nrises Vayu, having the properties of sound and touch. From Vayu springs Tejas,\npossessing the property of visibility, as well as those of its predecessors.\nFrom Tejas rises Ap, combining with the above properties its distinctive\nfeature,--flavour. Bhumi comes from Ap, bringing the additional property of\nsmell to its inheritance.\n\n[166:6](sbg12.htm#fr_164) _I am the origin &c.:_ In Me the whole universe\noriginates and dissolves, as everything springs froth My Prakriti.\n\n[167:7](sbg12.htm#fr_165) _Beyond Me_ --there is no other cause of the\nuniverse but Me.\n\n[167:8](sbg12.htm#fr_166) In Me as essence, all these are woven, as being My\nmanifestations.\n\n[169:11](sbg12.htm#fr_167) _Desire --Kama:_ thirst for objects not present to\nthe senses.\n\n_Attachment --Raga:_ for those presented to the senses .\n\n_Unopposed to Dharma:_ the desire which moves in harmony with the ordained\nduties of life.\n\n[169:12](sbg12.htm#fr_168) All things are in Him, yet not He in them.\nLogically, this can' only happen in superimposition through illusion: as that\nof a ghost seen in the stump of a tree; the ghost is in the stump, from the\npoint of view of the man in the dark, but the stump is never p. 170 in the\nghost. Similarly the universe is superimposed on the Lord, seen in His place\nthrough Maya, but He is not in it. The Lord returns to the same teaching in\nChap. IX. 4, 5.\n\n[170:14](sbg12.htm#fr_169) p. 171 _Divine:_ transcending human perception.\n\n_Devote . . . alone:_ Abandoning all formal religion (Dharma) completely take\nrefuge in Me, their own Self, the Lord of illusion.\n\n[171:15](sbg12.htm#fr_170) _Way of the Asuras_ , _i.e._ , cruelty, untruth,\nand the like.\n\n[172:16](sbg12.htm#fr_171) _Seeker of enjoyment:_ One who wishes for objects\nof enjoyment, both here and hereafter.\n\n_The Wise:_ One who has forsaken all desires, knowing them to arise from Maya.\n\n[173:20](sbg12.htm#fr_172) _Own natures:_ Samskaras acquired in previous\nlives.\n\n[175:23](sbg12.htm#fr_173) _These men of little understanding:_ Though the\namount of exertion is the same (in the two kinds of worship), these people do\nnot take refuge in Me, by doing which they may attain infinite results.\n\n[175:24](sbg12.htm#fr_174) The ignorant take Me as an ordinary mortal,\nassuming embodiment from the unmanifested state, like all other men, being\nimpelled by the force of past Karma. This is due to their ignorance of My real\nnature; hence they do not worship Me, the One without a second.\n\n[176:25](sbg12.htm#fr_175) This Yoga-Maya spread over the Lord, which veils\nthe understanding of others in recognising Him, does not obscure His own\nknowledge, as it is His, and He is the wielder of it,--just as the glamour\n(Maya) caused by a juggler (Mayavin) does not obstruct his own knowledge. This\nillusion which binds others, cannot dim His vision.\n\n[177:27](sbg12.htm#fr_176) To one whose mind is subject to the dualistic\ndelusion, caused by the passions of desire and aversion, there cannot indeed\narise a knowledge of things as they are, even of the external world; far less\ncan such an intellect grasp the transcendental knowledge of the innermost\nSelf.\n\n[178:29](sbg12.htm#fr_177) ( _They know_ ) _the whole of Adhy atma:_ They\nrealise in full the Reality underlying the innermost individual Self.\n\n[178:30](sbg12.htm#fr_178) Their consciousness of Me continues as ever,\nunaffected by the change of approaching death.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Eighth Chapter.
