The\nmistake is probably due to a correction, sa for sha; the commentator, however,\nconsiders it as a Vedic license. Skaro 'dhika _s_ _kh_ andasa _h_.\n\n[218:5](sbe01212.htm#fr_540) These are meant for the Nishkevalya hymn recited\nat the noon-libation of the Mahavrata. That hymn consists of ten parts,\ncorresponding, as we saw, to ten parts of a bird, viz. its body, neck, head,\nroot of wings, right wing, left wing, tail, belly, chest, and thighs. The\nverses corresponding to these ten parts, beginning with tad id asa bhuvaneshu\n_g_ yesh _th_ am, are given in the first \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka, and more fully in the\nfifth \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka by _S_ aunaka. p. 219 Though they consist of many metres,\nyet, when one counts the syllables, they give a thousand B _ri_ hati verses,\neach consisting of thirty-six syllables.\n\n[219:1](sbe01212.htm#fr_541) Although the Nishkevalya is but one hymn,\nconsisting of eighty t _ri_ _k_ as, yet as these eighty t _ri_ _k_ as were\nrepresented as three kinds of food (see Ait. \xc3\x82r. II, 1, 2, 2-4), the hymn is\nrepresented as three hymns, first as eighty Gayatri t _ri_ _k_ as, then as\neighty B _ri_ hati t _ri_ _k_ as, lastly as eighty Ush _n_ ih t _ri_ _k_ as.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 4](sbe01213.htm)\n\n"
