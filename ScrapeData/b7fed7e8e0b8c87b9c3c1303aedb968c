We have established that this highest Brahman, which is the sole\ncause of the world, cannot be the object of the other means of knowledge, and\nhence is to be known through scripture only. We have pointed out that the\nposition of scripture as an authoritative means of knowledge is established by\nthe fact that all the Vedanta-texts connectedly refer to the highest Brahman,\nwhich, although not related to any injunctions of action or abstention\n\np. 256\n\nfrom action, by its own essential nature constitutes the highest end of man.\nWe have proved that Brahman, which the Vedanta-texts teach to be the sole\ncause of the world, must be an intelligent principle other than the non-\nsentient pradhana. since Brahman is said to think. We have declared that this\nintelligent principle is other than the so-called individual soul, whether in\nthe state of bondage or that of release; since the texts describe it as in the\nenjoyment of supreme bliss, all-wise, the cause of fear or fearlessness on the\npart of intelligent beings, the inner Self of all created things, whether\nintelligent or non-intelligent, possessing the power of realising all its\npurposes, and so on.--We have maintained that this highest Being has a divine\nform, peculiar to itself, not made of the stuff of Prak _ri_ ti, and not due\nto karman.--We have explained that the being which some texts refer to as a\nwell-known cause of the world--designating it by terms such as ether or\nbreath, which generally denote a special non-sentient being--is that same\nhighest Self which is different from all beings, sentient or non-sentient.--We\nhave declared that, owing to its connexion with heaven, this same highest Self\nis to be recognised in what the text calls a 'light,' said to possess supreme\nsplendour, such as forms a special characteristic of the highest Being. We\nhave stated that, as we recognise through insight derived from scripture, that\nsame highest Person is denoted by terms such as Indra, and so on; as the text\nascribes to that 'Indra' qualities exclusively belonging to the highest Self,\nsuch, e.g., as being the cause of the attainment of immortality.--And the\ngeneral result arrived at was that the Vedanta-texts help us to the knowledge\nof one being only, viz. Brahman, or the highest Person, or Naraya _n_ a--of\nwhom it is shown that he cannot possibly be the object of the other means of\nknowledge, and whom the possession of an unlimited number of glorious\nqualities proves to differ totally from all other beings whatsoever.\n\nNow, although Brahman is the only object of the teaching of the Vedanta-texts,\nyet some of these texts might give rise to the notion that they aim at setting\nforth (not\n\np. 257\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahman), but some particular being comprised within\neither the pradhana or the aggregate of individual souls. The remaining Padas\nof the first Adhyaya therefore apply themselves to the task of dispelling this\nnotion and proving that what the texts in question aim at is to set forth\ncertain glorious qualities of Brahman. The second Pada discusses those texts\nwhich contain somewhat obscure references to the individual soul; the third\nPada those which contain clear references to the same; and the fourth Pada\nfinally those texts which appear to contain even clearer intimations of the\nindividual soul, and so on.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 1.
