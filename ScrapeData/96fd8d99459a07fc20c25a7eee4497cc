Hari _h_ , Om. He who knows the first and the best, becomes himself the\nfirst and the best among his people. Breath is indeed the first and the best.\nHe who knows this, becomes the first and the best among his people, and among\nwhomsoever he wishes to be so.\n\n2\\. He who knows the richest 2, becomes himself the richest among his people.\nSpeech is the richest. He who knows this, becomes the richest among his\npeople, and among whomsoever he wishes to be so.\n\n3\\. He who knows the firm rest, becomes himself firm on even and uneven\nground. The eye indeed is the firm rest, for by means of the eye a man stands\nfirm on even and uneven ground. He who knows this, stands firm on even and\nuneven ground.\n\n4\\. He who knows success, whatever desire he desires, it succeeds to him. The\near indeed is success. For in the ear are all these Vedas successful. He who\nknows this, whatever desire he desires, it succeeds to him.\n\n5\\. He who knows the home, becomes a home of his own people, a home of all\nmen. The mind\n\np. 202\n\nindeed is the home. He who knows this, becomes a home of his own people and a\nhome of all men.\n\n6\\. He who knows generation 1, becomes rich in offspring and cattle. Seed\nindeed is generation. He who knows this, becomes rich in offspring and cattle.\n\n7\\. These Pra _n_ as (senses), when quarrelling together as to who was the\nbest, went to Brahman 2 and said: 'Who is the richest of us?' He replied: 'He\nby whose departure this body seems worst, he is the richest.'\n\n8\\. The tongue (speech) departed, and having been absent for a year, it came\nback and said: 'How have you been able to live without me?' They replied:\n'Like unto people, not speaking with the tongue, but breathing with breath,\nseeing with the eye, hearing with the ear, knowing with the mind, generating\nwith seed. Thus we have lived.' Then speech entered in.\n\n9\\. The eye (sight) departed, and having been absent for a year, it came back\nand said: 'How have you been able to live without me?' They replied: 'Like\nblind people, not seeing with the eye, but breathing with the breath, speaking\nwith the tongue, hearing with the ear, knowing with the mind, generating with\nseed. Thus we have lived.' Then the eye entered in.\n\n10\\. The ear (hearing) departed, and having been absent for a year, it came\nback and said: 'How have you been able to live without me?' They replied:\n'Like deaf people, not hearing with the ear,\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[201:1](sbe15094.htm#fr_591) This Brahma _n_ a, also called a Khila (p. 1010,\nl. 8; p. 1029, l. 8), occurs in the Madhyandina- _s_ akha XIV, 9, 2. It should\nbe compared with the _Kh_ andogya-upanishad V, 1 (Sacred Books of the East,\nvol. i, p. 72); also with the Ait. \xc3\x82r. II, 4; Kaush. Up. III, 3; and the Pra\n_s_ _\xc3\xb1_ a Up. II, 3.\n\n[201:2](sbe15094.htm#fr_592) Here used as a feminine, while in the _Kh_ and.\nUp. V, 1, it is vasish _th_ a.\n\n[202:1](sbe15094.htm#fr_593) This is wanting in the _Kh_ and. Up. Roer and\nPoley read Pra _g_ apati for pra _g_ ati. MS, I. O. 3 75 has pra _g_ ati, MS.\nI. O. 1973 pra _g_ apati.\n\n[202:2](sbe15094.htm#fr_594) Here we have Pra _g_ apati, instead of Brahman,\nin the _Kh_ and. Up.; also sresh _th_ a instead of vasish _th_ a.\n\np. 203\n\nbut breathing with the breath, speaking with the tongue, seeing with the eye,\nknowing with the mind, generating with seed. Thus we have lived.' Then the ear\nentered in.\n\n11\\. The mind departed, and having been absent for a year, it came back and\nsaid: 'How have you been able to live without me?' They replied: 'Like fools,\nnot knowing with their mind, but breathing with the breath, seeing with the\neye, hearing with the ear, generating with seed. Thus we have lived.' Then the\nmind entered in.\n\n12\\. The seed departed, and having been absent for a year, it came back and\nsaid: 'How have you been able to live without me?' They replied: 'Like\nimpotent people, not generating with seed, but breathing with the breath,\nseeing with the eye, hearing with the ear, knowing with the mind. Thus we have\nlived.' Then the seed entered in.\n\n13\\. The (vital) breath, when on the point of departing, tore up these senses,\nas a great, excellent horse of the Sindhu country might tare up the pegs to\nwhich he is tethered. They said to him: 'Sir, do not depart. We shall not be\nable to live without thee.' He said: 'Then make me an offering.' They said:\n'Let it be so.'\n\n14\\. Then the tongue said: 'If I am the richest, then thou art the richest by\nit.' The eye said: 'If I am the firm rest, then thou art possessed of firm\nrest by it.' The ear said: 'If I am success, then thou art possessed of\nsuccess by it.' The mind said: 'If I am the home, thou art the home by it.'\nThe seed said: 'If I am generation, thou art possessed of generation by it.'\nHe said: 'What shall be food, what shall be dress for me?'\n\np. 204\n\nThey replied: 'Whatever there is, even unto dogs, worms, insects, and birds 1,\nthat is thy food, and water thy dress. He who thus knows the food of Ana (the\nbreath) 2, by him nothing is eaten that is not (proper) food, nothing is\nreceived that is not (proper) food. _S_ rotriyas (Vedic theologians) who know\nthis, rinse the mouth with water when they are going to eat, and rinse the\nmouth with water after they have eaten, thinking that thereby they make the\nbreath dressed (with water).'\n\n[204:1](sbe15094.htm#fr_595) It may mean, every kind of food, such as is eaten\nby dogs, worms, insects, and birds.\n\n[204:2](sbe15094.htm#fr_596) We must read, with MS. I. O. 375, anasyannam, not\nannasyannam, as MS. I. O. 1973, Roer, and Poley read. Weber has the right\nreading, which is clearly suggested by _Kh_ and. Up. V, 2, 1.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 2](sbe15095.htm)\n\n"
