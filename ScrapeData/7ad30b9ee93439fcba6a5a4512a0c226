D. Barnett, [1911], at sacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\n#### XI. The Wisdom of Raikva 1\n\nJ\xc4\x81na\xc5\x9bruti Pautr\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a was a devout giver, bestowing much largesse, preparing\nmuch food. He caused lodgings to be built everywhere, that he might have men\neverywhere fed. Now in the night there flew swans by. One swan said to\nanother, "Ho, ho, Dim-eye, Dim-eye! J\xc4\x81na\xc5\x9bruti\n\np. 81\n\n[paragraph continues] Pautr\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a\'s splendour is outspread like that of the\nheavens; so touch it not, lest thou burn thyself."\n\nThe other answered him, "Who forsooth is he of whom thou speakest as though he\nwere Raikva of the Cart?"\n\n"What meanest thou by Raikva of the Cart?"\n\n"As the lower dice-throws fall under the winning four-throw, so whatsoever\ngood deed the people do falls to him; of him who knows this and of that which\nhe knows do I speak." 1\n\nJ\xc4\x81na\xc5\x9bruti Pautr\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a overheard this. When he rose up, he said to his\nchamberlain, "Ho, thou speakest as of Raikva of the Cart 2; what meanest thou\nby Raikva of the Cart?"\n\n"As the lower dice-throws fall under the winning four-throw, so whatsoever\ngood deed the people do falls to him; of him who knows this and of that which\nhe knows do I speak."\n\nThe chamberlain sought [Raikva], and came back, saying "I have found him not."\n[J\xc4\x81na\xc5\x9bruti] said to him, "Ho, go for him in the place where a Brahman is to be\nsought."\n\np. 82\n\n[Raikva] was under a waggon, scratching his scabs; and he 1 sat down before\nhim, and said to him, "Art thou Raikva of the Cart, my lord?"\n\n"Yea, I am," he answered.\n\nThe chamberlain came back, saying, "I have found him."\n\nThen J\xc4\x81na\xc5\x9bruti Pautr\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a took six hundred kine, a golden chain, and a mule-\ncar, and drew near to him, and said, "Raikva, here are six hundred kine, a\ngolden chain, and a mule-car; my lord, teach me the deity that thou\nworshippest."\n\nBut the other answered, "Fie on thee, base fellow; keep them for thyself, with\nthy kine!"\n\nThen J\xc4\x81na\xc5\x9bruti Pautr\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a took a thousand kine, a golden chain, a mule-car,\nand his daughter, and drew near to him, and said, "Raikva, here are a thousand\nkine, a golden chain, a mule-car, a wife, and the village in which thou art\nsitting; my lord, teach me!"\n\nHe lifted up her face, and said, "He has brought these! Base fellow, with this\nface alone thou mightest have made me speak."\n\nThat is the place called Raikva-par\xe1\xb9\x87a in the land of the Mah\xc4\x81v\xe1\xb9\x9bishas where he\ndwelt at his bidding.\n\nThus he said to him:\n\n"The Wind in sooth is an ingatherer. When fire goes out, it sinks into the\nWind. When the sun goes down, it sinks into the Wind. When\n\np. 83\n\nthe moon goes down, it sinks into the Wind. When waters dry up, they sink into\nthe Wind. For the Wind gathers in all these. Thus as to godhead.\n\nNow as to personality. The Breath is an in-gatherer. 1 When one sleeps, the\nspeech sinks into the Breath, the eye into the Breath, the ear into the\nBreath, the mind into the Breath. For the Breath gathers in all these. These\nare the two ingatherers, the Wind among the gods and the Breath among the\nbreaths.\n\nA Brahman-student begged alms of \xc5\x9aaunaka K\xc4\x81peya and Abhiprat\xc4\x81ri K\xc4\x81kshaseni\nwhen their meal was set before them. They gave him nothing. He said:\n\n"Who is the one God, guardian of the world,  \nWho swallowed up the other mighty four?  \nOn him, K\xc4\x81peya, mortals may not look;  \nAbhiprat\xc4\x81ri, many are his homes.\n\nTo him forsooth who has this food it is not given."\n\nThen \xc5\x9aaunaka K\xc4\x81peya, having pondered, answered him thus:\n\n"The spirit of the Gods, the creatures\' sire,  \nGolden of tooth and greedy he, nor witless.  \nExceeding is his majesty, they say,  \nFor he uneaten eats what none may eat.\n\n"So this is what we worship, O Brahman student.\n\np. 84\n\n[paragraph continues] Give him alms!" And they gave to him.\n\nThese in sooth are the ten, five and five [1](brk40.htm#fn_44); this is the\nfour-throw. Therefore the ten, the four-throw, are in all parts of the world\nas food. This is Vir\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad, eater of food; thereby all the world is seen. All the\nworld is seen by him, he becomes an eater of food, who has this knowledge."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[80:1](brk39.htm#fr_39) Chh\xc4\x81ndogya Upanishad, IV. 1-3.\n\n[81:1](brk39.htm#fr_40) The Hindus know of four casts of the dice--the _k\n\xe1\xb9\x9bita,_ counting as four, the _tret \xc4\x81,_ counting as three, the _dv \xc4\x81para,_\ncounting as two, and the _kali,_ reckoned as one; the _k \xe1\xb9\x9bita_ outweighs all\nthe other throws, and hence has the value of 10. Raikva has universal wisdom;\nhence the virtues of all other men are merely parts of his excellence, which\nincludes them all.\n\n[81:2](brk39.htm#fr_41) The chamberlain, after Hindu custom, had addressed him\nin strains of panegyric on his rising from bed.\n\n[82:1](brk39.htm#fr_42) The chamberlain of J\xc4\x81na\xc5\x9bruti\n\n[83:1](brk39.htm#fr_43) See \xc2\xa7 18.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XII: Satyakama](brk40.htm)\n\n'
