Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! Whatever is given as charities to any\nman besmeared with the holy ashes, takes away instantly all the sins of the\ndonor. The S\xc2\x92rutis, Smritis, and all the Pura _n_ as declare the greatness of\nthis Bhasma. So the twice-born must accept this. Whoever holds this Tripu _nd_\nra, of this holy ashes at the three Sandhya times, is freed from all his sins\nand goes to the region of S\xc2\x92iva. The Yogi who takes a bath of ashes throughout\nhis body during the three Sandhyas, gets his Yoga developed soon. By this bath\nof ashes, many generations are lifted up. O Narada! This ash bath is many\ntimes superior to the water bath. To take once a bath of ashes secures to one\nall the merits acquired by bathing in all the sacred places of pilgrimages.\nThere is no doubt in this. By this bath of ashes, all the Mahapatakas (great\nheinous sins) and other minor sins as well are instantly destroyed as heaps of\nwood are brought down to ashes in a moment by the fire. No bath is holier than\nthis one. This is first mentioned by S\xc2\x92iva and He took Himself this bath.\nSince then this bath of ashes has been taken with great care by Brahma and the\nother Devas and the Munis for their own good in all the virtuous actions. This\nbath of ashes is termed the bath of fire. So he who applies ashes on his head,\ngets the state of Rudra while he is in this body of five elements. Those who\nare delighted to see persons with this ashes on their bodies are respected by\nthe Devas, Asuras, and Munis. He who honours and gets up on seeing a man\nbesmeared with ashes is respected even by Indra, the Lord of Heavens. Even if\nanybody eats any uneatables, then the sin incurred thereby won\xc2\x92t touch him, if\nhis body be then besmeared with ashes. He who first takes a water bath and\nthen an ash-bath, be he a Brahmachari or an house-holder or an anchorite\n(Vanaprasthi) is freed of all sins and gets in the end the highest state.\nSpecially for the Yatis (ascetics), this ash bath is very necessary. This ash\nbath is superior to the water bath. For the bonds of Nature, this pleasure and\npain, are cut asunder by this ash bath. The Munis know this Prakriti as moist\nand wet; and therefore Prakriti binds men. If anybody desires to cut asunder\nthis bondage of the body, he will find no other remedy for this in the three\nworlds than this Holy Bath of ashes.\n\n\n\np. 1089\n\n\n\n18-43. In ancient days the ashes were first offered to the Devi gladly by the\nDevas for their protection, their good and purification, when they first saw\nthe ashes. Therefore anybody who takes this bath of fire, gets all his sins\ndestroyed and he goes to S\xc2\x92iva Loka. He who daily uses this ashes has not to\nsuffer from the oppression of the Rak _s_ asas, Pis\xc2\x92achas, Putanas and the\nother Bhutas or from disease, leprosy, the chronic enlargement of spleen, all\nsorts of fistulae, from eighty sorts of rheumatism, sixty four kinds of\nbilious diseases, twenty two varieties of phlegmatic diseases and from tigers,\nthieves, and other vicious planetary influences. Rather he gets the power to\nsuppress all these as a lion kills easily a mad elephant. Anybody who first\nmixes the ashes with pure cold water and then besmears his body with that and\nputs on the Tripu _nd_ ras, attains soon the Highest Brahma. He who holds the\nTripu _nd_ ra of ashes becomes sinless and goes to the Brahma loka. He can\neven wipe off the ordnances of the fate on his forehead to go to the jaws of\nDeath, if he uses, according to the S\xc2\x92astras, the Tripu _nd_ ras on his\nforehead. If the ashes be used on the neck, then the sin, incurred through the\nneck, is completely destroyed. If the ashes be used on the neck, then the sin\nincurred by the neck, in eating uneatable things is entirely destroyed. If the\nashes be held on the arms, then the sin incurred by the arms is destroyed. If\nit be held on the breast, the sin done mentally is destroyed. If it be held on\nthe navel, the sin incurred by the generative organ is destroyed. If it be\nheld on the anus, then the sin incurred by the anus is destroyed. And if it be\nheld on the sides, then the sin incurred in embracing other\xc2\x92s wives is\ndestroyed. So, know fully, to use ashes is highly commendable. Everywhere\nthree curved lines of ashes are to be used. Know these three lines as Brahma,\nVi _sn_ u and Mahes\xc2\x92a; Dak _s_ i _n_ agni, Garhapatya fire and \xc3\x82havaniva fire;\nthe Sattva, Rajas and Tamas qualities, Heaven, earth and Patala (nether\nregions). If the wise Brahmi _n_ holds properly the ashes his Mahapatakas are\ndestroyed. He is not involved in any sin. Rather he, without any questionings,\ngets his liberation. All the sins, in the body besmeared with ashes, are burnt\ndown by the ashes, which is of the nature of fire, into ashes. He is called\nBhasmani _st_ ha (a devotee of Bhasma, i.e., ashes) who takes a bath of ashes,\nwho besmears his body with ashes, who use the Tripu _nd_ ras of ashes, who\nsleeps in ashes. He is called also \xc3\x82tmani _st_ ha, a devotee of \xc3\x82tman (Self).\nAt the approach of such a man, the Demons, Pis\xc2\x92achas, and very serious\ndiseases run away to a distance. There is no doubt in this. In as much as\nthese ashes reveal the knowledge of Brahma, it is called Bhasita from Bhasma,\nto shine; because it eats up the sins, it is called Bhasma; because it\nincreases the eight supernatural powers Anima, etc., it is called\n\n\n\np. 1090\n\n\n\nBhuti; because it protects the man who uses it, it is called \xc2\x93Rak _s_ a.\xc2\x94 As\nthe sins are all destroyed by the mere remembrance of Bhagavan Rudra, so\nseeing the person using the Tripu _nd_ ra, the demons, bad spirits and other\nvicious hosts of spirits fly away quickly, trembling with fear. As a fire\nburns a great forest by its own strength, so this bath of ashes burns the sins\nof those who are incessantly addicted to sins. Even if at the time of death\none takes a bath of ashes, though he has committed an inordinate amount of\nvices, all his sins are soon destroyed. By this bath of ashes, the Self is\npurified, the anger is destroyed; the senses are calmed down. The man who uses\neven once this Bhasma comes to Me; he has not to take any more births in\nfuture. On Monday Amavasya (also on the full moon day) if one sees the S\xc2\x92iva\nLingam, with his body besmeared all over with ashes, one\xc2\x92s sins will all be\ndestroyed. (All the sins are not seen; hence the tithi is called Amavas.) If\npeople use Bhasma daily, all their desires will be fructified whether they\nwant longevity, or prosperity or Mukti. The Tripu _nd_ ra that represents\nBrahma, Vi _sn_ u and S\xc2\x92iva is very sacred. Seeing the man with Tripu _nd_ ra\non, the fierce Rak _s_ asas or mischievous creatures flee to a distance. There\nis no doubt in this. After doing the S\xc2\x92aucha (necessary cleanliness) and other\nnecessary things, one bathes in pure cold water and besmears his body with\nashes from head to foot. By taking the water bath only, the outward unclean\nthings are destroyed. But the ash bath not only cleanses the outer external\nuncleanliness but cleanses also all the internal uncleanliness. So even if one\ndoes not take the water bath, one ought to take this ash bath. There is to be\nno manner of doubt in this.\n\n\n\n44-47. All the religious actions performed without this ash bath seem as if no\nactions are done at all. This ash bath is stated in the Vedas. Its another\nname is the Fire Bath. By this ash bath both outside and inside are purified.\nSo a man who uses ashes gets the entire fruit of worshipping S\xc2\x92iva. By the\nwater Bath only the outside dirt is removed; but by this bath of ashes,\noutside dirts and inside dirts, both are fully removed. If this water bath be\ntaken many times daily, still without an ash bath, one\xc2\x92s heart is not\npurified. What more shall I speak of the greatness of ashes, the Vedas only\nappreciate its glories rightly! Yea, very rightly!\n\n\n\n48-50. Or Maha Deva, the Gem of all the Devas, knows the greatness of this\nBhasma. Those who perform rites and works prescribed\n\n\n\np. 1091\n\n\n\nby the Vedas, without taking this bath of ashes, do not get even a tithe of\nthe fruits of their works done. Only that man will be entitled to the entire\nfruits of the Vedas who perform this bath of ashes duly. This is the opinion\nof the Vedas. This bath of ashes purifies more the things that are already\npure; thus the S\xc2\x92ruti says. That wretch who does not take the bath of ashes as\naforesaid is a Great Sinner. There is no doubt in this. By this bath greater\ninterminable merits accrue than what is obtained by innumerable baths taken by\nthe Brahma _n_ as on the Varu _n_ i momentous occasion. So take this bath\ncarefully in the morning, midday and evening. This bath of ashes is ordained\nin the Vedas. So know those who are against this bath mentioned in the Vedas,\nare verily fallen! After evacuating oneself of one\xc2\x92s urine and faeces, one\nought to take this bath of ashes. Otherwise men will not be purified. Even if\none performs duly the water bath and if one does not take this bath of ashes,\nthat man will not be purified. So he cannot get any right to do any religious\nactions. After evacuating one\xc2\x92s abdomen of the outgoing air, after yawning,\nafter holding sexual intercourses, after spitting and sneezing, and after\neasing oneself of phlegm, one ought to take this bath of ashes. O Narada! Thus\nI have described to you here the greatness of S\xc2\x92ri Bhasma. I am again telling\nyou more of it specially. Listen attentively.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fourteenth Chapter of the Eleventh Book on the greatness in\nholding the Bibhuti (ashes) in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of\n18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 15](bk11ch15.htm)\n\n'
