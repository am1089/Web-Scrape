The Garud\xcc\x81a Puran\xcc\x81a\n\n17\\. Garud\xcc\x81a Puran\xcc\x81a. "That which Vishn\xcc\x81u recited in the Garud\xcc\x81a Kalpa,\nrelating chiefly to the birth of Garud\xcc\x81a from Vinata, is here called the\nGarud\xcc\x81a Puran\xcc\x81a; and in it there are read nineteen thousand verses 79."\n\nThe Garud\xcc\x81a Puran\xcc\x81a which has been the subject of my examination corresponds\nin no respect with this description, and is probably a different work, though\nentitled the Garud\xcc\x81a Puran\xcc\x81a. It is identical, however, with two copies in the\nCompany\'s library. It consists of no more than about seven thousand stanzas;\nit is repeated by Brahma to Indra; and it contains no account of the birth of\nGaruda. There is a brief notice of the creation; but the greater part is\noccupied with the description of Vratas, or religious observances, of\nholidays, of sacred places dedicated to the sun, and with prayers from the\nTantrika ritual, addressed to the sun, to \xc5\x9aiva, and to Vishn\xcc\x81u. It contains\nalso treatises on astrology, palmistry, and precious stones; and one, still\nmore extensive, on medicine. The latter portion, called the Preta Kalpa, is\ntaken up with directions for the performance of obsequial rites. There is\nnothing in\n\np. liv\n\nall this to justify the application of the name. Whether a genuine Garud\xcc\x81a\nPuran\xcc\x81a exists is doubtful. The description given in the Matsya is less\nparticular than even the brief notices of the other Puran\xcc\x81as, and might have\neasily been written without any knowledge of the book itself, being, with\nexception of the number of stanzas, confined to circumstances that the title\nalone indicates.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[liii:79](vp021.htm#fr_78) [![](tn/generic.jpg)  \nClick to view](img/_05300.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 18.
