prince's mind  \nTo rest that day was well inclined,  \nHe sought Kaikeyi's son to please  \nWith hospitable courtesies.  \nThen Bharat to the saint replied:  \n'Our wants are more than satisfied.  \nThe gifts which honoured strangers greet,  \nAnd water for our weary feet  \nHast thou bestowed with friendly care,  \nAnd every choice of woodland fare.'  \n   Then Bharadvaja spoke, a smile  \nPlaying upon his lips the while:  \n'I know, dear Prince, thy friendly mind  \nWill any fare sufficient find,  \nBut gladly would I entertain  \nAnd banquet all thine armed train:  \nSuch is my earnest wish: do thou  \nThis longing of my heart allow,  \nWhy host thou hither bent thy way,  \nAnd made thy troops-behind thee stay?  \n\np. 198  \n\nWhy unattended? couldst thou not  \nWith friends and army seek this spot?'  \n   Bhharat, with reverent hands raised high,  \nTo that great hermit made reply:  \n'My troops, for awe of thee, O Sage,  \nI brought not to thy hermitage:  \nTroops of a king or monarch's son  \nA hermit's home should ever shun.  \nBehind me comes a mighty train  \nWide spreading o'er the ample plain,  \nWhere every chief and captain leads  \nMen, elephants, and mettled steeds  \nI feared, O reverend Sage, lest these  \nMight harm the holy ground and trees,  \nSprings might be marred and cots o'er-thrown,  \nSo with the priests I came alone.'  \n   'Bring all thy host,' the hermit cried,  \nAnd Bharat, to his joy, complied.  \nThen to the chapel went the sire,  \nWhere ever burnt the sacred fire,  \nAnd first, in order due, with sips  \nOf water purified his lips:  \nTo Visvakarma, then he prayed,  \nHis hospitable feast to aid:  \n'Let Vis'vakarma hear my call,  \nThe God who forms and fashions all:  \nA mighty banquet I provide,  \nBe all my wants this day supplied.  \nLord Indra at their head, the three  1  \nWho guard the worlds I call to me:  \nA mighty host this day I feed,  \nBe now supplied my every need.  \nLet all the streams that eastward go,  \nAnd those whose waters westering flow,  \nBoth on the earth and in the sky,  \nFlow hither and my wants supply.  \nBe some with ardent liquor filled,  \nAnd some with wine from flowers distilled,  \nWhile some their fresh cool streams retain  \nSweet as the juice of sugar-cane,  \nI call the Gods I call the band  \nOf minstrels that around them stand:  \nI call the Haha and Huhu,  \nI call the sweet Vis'vasa  \nI call the heavenly wives of these  \nWith all the bright Apsarases,  \nAlambushe of beauty rare,  \nThe charmer of the tangled hair,  \nGhritachi And Vis'vachi fair,  \nHema and Bhima sweet to view,  \nAnd lovely Nagadanta too,  \nAnd all the sweetest nymphs who stand  \nBy Indra or by Brahma's hand--  \nI summon these with all their train  \nAnd Tumburu to lead the strain.  \nHere let Kuvera's garden rise  \nWhich far in Northern Kuru  2 lies:  \n\nFor leaves let cloth and gems entwine,  \nAnd let its fruit be nymphs divine.  \nLet Soma  1b give the noblest food  \nTo feed the mighty multitude,  \nOf every kind, for tooth and lip,  \nTo chew, to lick, to suck, and sip.  \nLet wreaths, where fairest flowers abound,  \nSpring from the trees that bloom around.  \nEach sort of wine to woo the taste,  \nAnd meats of every kind be placed.'  \n   Thus spake the hermit sulf-restrained,  \nWith proper tone by rules ordained,  \nOn deepest meditation bent,  \nIn holy might predominent.  \nThen as with hands in reverence raised  \nAbsorbed in thought he eastward gazed,  \nThe deities be thus addreased  \nCame each in semblance manifest.  \nDelicious gales that cooled the frame  \nFrom Malaya and Dardar came,  \nThat kissed those scented hills and threw  \nAuspicious fragrance where they blew.  \nThen falling fast in sweetest showers  \nCame from the sky immortal flowers,  \nAnd all the airy region round  \nWith heavenly drums was made to sound.  \nThen breathed a soft celestial breeze,  \nThen danced the bright Apsarases,  \nThe minstrels and the Gods advanced,  \nAnd warbling lutes the soul entranced.  \nThe earth and sky that music filled,  \nAnd through each ear it softly thrilled,  \nAs from the heavenly quills it fell  \nWith time and tune attempered well.  \nSoon as the minstrels ceased to play  \nAnd airs celestial died away.  \nThe troops of Bharat saw amazed  \nWhat Vis'vakarma's art had raised.  \nOn every side, five leagues around,  \nAll smooth and level lay the ground,  \nWith fresh green grass that charmed the sight  \nLike sapphires blent with lazulite.  \nThere the Wood-apple hung the head,  \nThe Mango and the Citron glowed  \nThe Bel and scented Jak were there,  \nAnd Amla with fruitage fair.  \nThere, brought from Northern Kuru, stood  \nRich in delights, the glorious wood,  \nAnd many a stream was seen to glide  \n\np. 199  \n\nWith flowering trees along its side.  \nThere mansions rose with four wide halls,  \nAnd elephants and chargers' stalls,  \nAnd many a house of royal state,  \nTriumphal are and bannered gate.  \nWith noble doorways, sought the sky,  \nLike a pale cloud, a palace high,  \nWhich far and wide rare fragrance shed,  \nWith wreaths of white engarlanded.  \nSquare was its shape, its halls were wide,  \nWith many a seat and couch supplied,  \nDrink of all kinds, and every meat  \nSuch as celestial Gods might eat.  \nThen at the bidding of the seer  \nKaikeyi''s strong-armed son drew near.  \nAnd passed within that fair abode  \nWhich with the noblest jewels glowed.  \nThen, as Vas'ishtha led the way,  \nThe councillors, in due array.  \nFollowed delighted and amazed  \nAnd on the glorious structure gazed.  \nThen Bharat, Raghu's son, drew near  \nThe kingly throne, with prince and peer,  \nWhereby the chouri in the shade  \nOf the white canopy was laid.  \nBefore the throne he humbly bent  \nAnd honoured Rama, reverent,  \nThen in his hand the chouri bore,  \nAnd sat where sits a councillor,  \nHis ministers and household priest  \nSat by degrees from chief to least,  \nThen sat the captain of the host  \nAnd all the men he honoured most.  \nThen when the saint his order gave,  \nEach river with enchanted wave  \nRolled milk and curds divinely sweet  \nBefore the princely Bharat's feet;  \nAnd dwellings fair on either side,  \nWith gay white plaster beautified.  \nTheir heavenly roofs were seen to lift,  \nThe Bra'hman Bharady'aja's gift,  \nThen straight by Lord Kuvera sent,  \nGay with celestial ornament  \nOf bright attire and jewels' shine.  \nCame twenty thousand nymphs divine:  \nThe man on whom those beauties glanced  \nThat moment felt his soul entranced.  \nWith them from Nandan's blissful shades  \nCame twenty thousand heavenly maids.  \nTumburu, Na'rad, Gopa came,  \nAnd Sutanu, like radiant flame.  \nThe kings of the Gandharva throng,  \nAnd ravished Bharat with their song.  \nThen spoke the saint, and swift obeyed  \nAlambusb'a, the fairest maid,  \nAnd Mis'rakes'i bright to view,  \nRamana, Pundarik'a too,  \nAnd danced to him with graceful ease  \nThe dances of Apsarases.  \nAll deplete that by Gods are worn,  \nOr Chaitraratha's graves adorn,  \n\nBloomed by the saint's command arrayed  \nOn branches in Praya'ga's shade.  \nWhen at the saint's command the breeze  \nMade music with the Vilva trees,  \nTo wave in rhythmic beat began  \nThe boughs of each Myrobolan,  \nAnd holy fig-trees wore the look  \nOf dancers, as their leaflets shook.  \nThe fair Tama'la, palm, and pine,  \nWith trees that tower and plants that twine,  \nThe sweetly varying forms displayed  \nOf stately dame or bending maid.  \nHere men the foaming winecup quaffed,  \nHere drank of milk full many a draught,  \nAnd tasted meats of every kind,  \nWell dressed, whatever pleased their mind.  \nThen beauteous women, seven or eight,  \nStood ready by each man to wait:  \nBeside the stream his limbs they stripped  \nAnd in the cooling water dipped.  \nAnd then the fair ones, sparkling eyed,  \nWith soft hands rubbed his limbs and dried.  \nAnd sitting on the lovely bank  \nHeld up the winecup as he drank.  \nNor did the grooms forget to feed  \nCamel and mule and ox and steed,  \nFor there were stores of roasted grain,  \nOf honey and of sugar-cane.  \nSo fast the wild excitement spread  \nAmong the warriors Bharat led,  \nThat all the mighty army through  \nThe groom no more his charger knew,  \nAnd he who drove might seek in vain  \nTo tell his elephant again.  \nWith every joy and rapture fired,  \nEntranced with all the heart desired,  \nThe myriads of the host that night  \nRevelled delirious with delight.  \nUrged by the damsels at their side  \nIn wild delight the warriors cried:  \n'Ne'er will we seek Ayodhya', no,  \nNor yet to Dandak forest go:  \nHere will we stay: may happy fate  \nOn Bharat and on Rama wait'  \nThus cried the army gay and free  \nExulting in their lawless glee,  \nBoth infantry and those who rode  \nOn elephants, or steeds bestrode,  \nTen thousand voices shouting, 'This  \nIs heaven indeed for perfect bliss.'  \nWith garlands decked they idly strayed,  \nAnd danced and laughed and sang and played.  \nAt length as every soldier eyed,  \nWith food like Amrit satisfied.  \nBach dainty cate and tempting meat,  \nNo longer had he care to eat.  \nThus soldier, servant, dame, and slave  \nReceived whate'er the wish might crave.  \nAs each in new-wrought clothes arrayed  \nEnjoyed the feast before him laid.  \n\np. 200  \n\nEach man was seen in white attire  \nUnstained by spot or speck of mire:  \nNone was athirst or hungry there,  \nAnd none had dust upon his hair.  \nOn every side in woody dells  \nWas milky food in bubbling wells,  \nAnd there were all-supplying cows  \nAnd honey dropping from the boughs.  \nNor wanted lakes of flower-made drink  \nWith piles of meat upon the brink,  \nboiled, stewed, and roasted, varied cheer,  \nPeachick and jungle-fowl and deer,  \nThere was the flesh of kid and boar,  \nAnd dainty sauce in endless store,  \nWith juice of flowers concocted well,  \nAnd soup that charmed the taste and smell,  \nAnd pounded fruits of bitter taste,  \nAnd many a bath was ready placed  \nDown by each river's shelving side  \nThere stood great basins well supplied,  \nAnd laid therein, of dazzling sheen,  \nWhite brushes for the teeth were seen,  \nAnd many a covered box wherein  \nWas sandal powdered for the skin.  \nAnd mirrors bright with constant care,  \nAnd piles of new attire were there,  \nAnd store of sandals and of shoes,  \nThousands of pairs, for all to choose:  \nEye-unguents, combs for hair and beard,  \nUmbrellas fair and bows appeared.  \nLakes gleamed, that lent digestive aid, [1](ry170.htm#fn_368)  \nAnd some for pleasant bathing made,  \nWith waters fair, and smooth incline  \nFor camels, horses, mules, and kine.  \nThere saw they barley heaped on high  \nThe coutless cattle to supply:  \nThe golden grain shone fair and bright  \nAs sapphires or the lazulite.  \nTo all the gathered host it seemed  \nAs if that magic scene they dreamed,  \nAnd wonder, as they gazed, increased  \nAt Bharadvaja's glorious feast.  \n   Thus in the hermit's grove they spent  \nThat night in joy and merriment,  \nBlest as the Gods who take their ease  \nUnder the shade of Nandan's trees.  \nEach minstrel bade the saint adieu,  \nAnd to his blissful mansion flew,  \nAiid every stream and heavenly dame  \nKtturned as swiftly as she came.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[198:1](ry169.htm#fr_365) Yama, Varuna and Kuvera.\n\n[198:2](ry169.htm#fr_366) A happy
