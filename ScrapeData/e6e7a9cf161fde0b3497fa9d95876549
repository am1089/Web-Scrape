In the account of Krishna and\nBalar\xc4\x81ma, who were born in the Yadu tribe, we have seen the end of that branch\nof the family. Sixteenth from Puru, the founder of the other\n\np. 412\n\nbranch, came Bharata, from whom India takes its name, Bharatvarsha (the\ncountry of Bharata), in the present day. Twenty-third from Bharata came\nS\xc4\x81ntanu. This S\xc4\x81ntanu had two sons, Bhishma, by the goddess Gang\xc4\x81 (the\nGanges), and Vichitrav\xc4\xabrya, by Satyavati. * Satyavati had a son named Vy\xc4\x81sa\nbefore her marriage with S\xc4\x81ntanu; so that Bhishma, Vichitrav\xc4\xabrya, and Vy\xc4\x81sa\nwere half-brothers. Bhishma became a Brahm\xc4\x81char\xc4\xab ( _i.e._ took a vow of\ncelibacy). Vy\xc4\x81sa retired to the wilderness to live a life of contemplation,\nbut promised his mother that he would obey her in everything.\n\nNow it so happened that Vichitrav\xc4\xabrya died childless, and Satyavati was\ntherefore obliged to ask her son Vy\xc4\x81sa to marry the childless widows. The\nresult was that the one wife, Ambik\xc4\x81, had a son who was born blind, named\nDhritar\xc4\x81shtra. This blindness is said to have been caused by the fact that\nVy\xc4\x81sa, coming in from his ascetic life, was so repulsive in appearance that\nAmbik\xc4\x81 kept her eyes closed all the time he remained with her. The other wife,\nnamed Amb\xc4\x81lika, had a son who was born of a pale complexion, and named P\xc4\x81ndu;\nthis paleness was the result of the fear that Vy\xc4\x81sa caused to the mother.\nSatyavati, not satisfied with either of these children, wished for another and\nperfect child. But Ambik\xc4\x81, dressing up one of her slaves, sent her to Vy\xc4\x81sa in\nher stead; the result was that this girl had a son who was called Vidura.\nAfter fulfilling his\n\np. 413\n\nmother\'s commands, Vy\xc4\x81sa returned to his ascetic life in the forest.\n\nBhishma, the uncle of these children, conducted the government of Hastin\xc4\x81pur\nin their name during their minority, and their education was also entrusted to\nhim. Dhritar\xc4\x81shtra, though blind, is described as excelling the others in\nstrength; P\xc4\x81ndu, as being skilled in the use of the bow; and Vidura, as pre-\neminent in virtue and wisdom.\n\nWhen the boys came of age, Dhritar\xc4\x81shtra was disqualified for the throne by\nreason of his blindness; Vidura could not be king because his mother was a\nSudra; P\xc4\x81ndu was therefore installed as king. Dhritar\xc4\x81shtra married G\xc4\x81ndh\xc4\x81ri\n(also called Saubaleyi, or Saubali), daughter of Subala, King of G\xc4\x81ndh\xc4\x81ra.\nP\xc4\x81ndu married Prith\xc4\x81 (or Kunti), the adopted daughter of Kuntibhoja. This\nPrith\xc4\x81, "one day, before her marriage, paid such respect and attention to a\npowerful sage named Durv\xc4\x81sas, a guest in her father\'s house, that he gave her\na charm, and taught her an incantation, by virtue of which she might have a\nchild by any god she liked to call into her presence. Out of curiosity, she\ninvoked the Sun, by whom she had a son who was born clothed in armour. But\nPrith\xc4\x81, fearing the censure of her relatives, deserted her offspring, after\nexposing it in the river. It was found by Adhirata, a charioteer, and nurtured\nby his wife R\xc4\x81dh\xc4\x81; whence the child was afterwards called R\xc4\x81dheya, though\nnamed by his foster-parents Vasushena. When he was grown up, the god Indra\nconferred upon him enormous strength, and changed his name to Karna." He is\nalso called Vaikartana, being the son of Vikartana (the Sun).\n\nP\xc4\x81ndu, at his uncle Bhishma\'s request, next marries M\xc4\x81dr\xc4\xab, sister of Salya,\nKing of Madra. Soon after this\n\np. 414\n\nmarriage, P\xc4\x81ndu undertook a great campaign, and extended his kingdom to the\ndimensions it had reached in the time of his great ancestor Bharata. He then,\nwith his two wives, retired to the woods, that he might indulge in his passion\nfor hunting. The blind Dhritar\xc4\x81shtra, with Bhishma as regent, ruled in his\nstead.\n\nDhritar\xc4\x81shtra had a hundred sons. The story of their birth is as follows: "One\nday, the sage Vy\xc4\x81sa was hospitably entertained by Queen G\xc4\x81ndh\xc4\x81ri, and in\nreturn granted her a boon. She chose to be the mother of a hundred sons. After\ntwo years she produced a mass of flesh, which was divided by Vy\xc4\x81sa into a\nhundred and one pieces, as big as the joint of a thumb. From these, in due\ntime, the eldest, Duryodhana, was born. The miraculous birth of the remaining\nninety-nine occurred in due course. There was also one daughter, named\nDuhsala." These sons of Dhritar\xc4\x81shtra are generally called "The Kurus," or\nKauravas.\n\nP\xc4\x81ndu\'s children were of divine origin. This circumstance happened in the\nfollowing manner: P\xc4\x81ndu, as noticed above, was addicted to hunting. One day,\nhe "transfixed with five arrows a male and female deer. These turned out to be\na certain sage and his wife, who had assumed the form of these animals. The\nsage cursed P\xc4\x81ndu, and predicted that he would die in the embraces of one of\nhis wives. In consequence of this curse, P\xc4\x81ndu took the vow of a Brahm\xc4\x81char\xc4\xab,\ngave all his property to the Br\xc4\x81hmans, and became a hermit."\n\nUpon this, Prith\xc4\x81, his wife, with his approval, employed the charm and\nincantation given to her by Durv\xc4\x81sas, and had three children: by the god\nDharma, Yudhishthira; by V\xc4\x81yu, Bh\xc4\xabma; and by Indra, Arjuna. M\xc4\x81dr\xc4\xab, the other\nwife of P\xc4\x81ndu, was now anxious to have children, and, acting on the advice of\nPrith\xc4\x81, she\n\np. 415\n\nthought of the Asvins, who appeared to her according to her wish, through whom\nshe became the mother of twin sons, Nakula and Sahadeva. Soon after this,\nP\xc4\x81ndu, forgetting the curse of the sage, died in the embraces of his wife\nM\xc4\x81dr\xc4\xab, who was burned with the dead body of her husband.\n\nPrith\xc4\x81 and the five children, generally known as the P\xc4\x81ndus, or P\xc4\x81ndavas, now\nreturned to Hastin\xc4\x81pur, and informed Dhritar\xc4\x81shtra of the death of his\nbrother; he seemed to be deeply moved by the event, and the P\xc4\x81ndus were\nallowed to live with his own sons, the Kurus.\n\nBut even when the cousins were children, enmity arose, and on one occasion the\njealousy of Duryodhana was excited to such a pitch that he tried to poison\nBh\xc4\xabma, and, when under its effect, threw him into the water. "Bh\xc4\xabma, however,\nwas not drowned, but descended to the abode of the N\xc4\x81gas (or serpent demons),\nwho freed him from the poison, and gave him a liquid to drink which endued him\nwith strength of ten thousand N\xc4\x81gas. From that moment he became a second\nHercules." Several schemes were formed for the destruction of the P\xc4\x81ndus, but\nwithout success.\n\n"The characters of the five P\xc4\x81ndavas are drawn with much artistic delicacy of\ntouch, and maintained with general consistency throughout the poem. The\neldest, Yudhishthira (the son of Dharma, virtue), is the Hindu ideal of\nexcellence--a pattern of justice; calm, passionless composure; chivalrous\nhonour and cold heroism." As the name implies (firm in battle), "he was\nprobably of commanding stature and imposing presence. He is described as\nhaving a majestic, lion-like gait, with a Wellington-like profile and long\nlotus-eyes.\n\n"Bh\xc4\xabma (the son of V\xc4\x81yu) is a type of brute courage and strength; he is of\ngigantic stature, impetuous,\n\np. 416\n\nirascible, somewhat vindictive, and cruel even to the verge of ferocity,\nmaking him, as his name implies, \'terrible.\' It would appear that his great\nstrength had to be maintained by plentiful supplies of food, as his name\nVrikodara, \'wolf-stomached,\' indicates a voracious appetite; and we are told\nthat at the daily meals of the five brothers, half of the whole dish had to be\ngiven to Bh\xc4\xabma. But he has the capacity for warm, unselfish love, and is\nardent in his affection for his mother and brothers.\n\n"Arjuna (the son of Indra) rises more to the European standard of perfection.\nHe may be regarded as the real hero of the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata, of undaunted bravery,\ngenerous, with refined and delicate sensibilities, tender-hearted, forgiving,\nand affectionate as a woman, yet of superhuman strength, and matchless in arms\nand athletic exercises. Nakula and Sahadeva (sons of the Asvins) are both\namiable, noble-hearted, and spirited. All five are as unlike as possible to\nthe hundred sons of Dhritar\xc4\x81shtra, who are represented as mean, spiteful,\ndishonourable, and vicious." Karna (the son of the Sun), though half-brother\nof these five P\xc4\x81ndus, in the great conflict is a valuable ally of the Kurus;\nthough in character he is entirely their opposite. "He exhibited in a high\ndegree fortitude, chivalrous honour, self-sacrifice, and devotion. Especially\nremarkable for a liberal and generous disposition, he never stooped to ignoble\npractices, like his friends, the Kurus, who were emphatically bad men."\n\nThe cousins were educated together at Hastin\xc4\x81pur by a Br\xc4\x81hman named Drona; all\nwere instructed in arms, but Arjuna, "by the help of Drona, who gave him\nmagical weapons, excelled all." Both Bh\xc4\xabma and the Kuru Duryodhana learnt the\nuse of the club from their\n\np. 417\n\ncousin Balar\xc4\x81ma; Prith\xc4\x81, Bh\xc4\xabma\'s mother, was a sister of Vasudeva, and\ntherefore aunt of Krishna. When their education was completed, a tournament\nwas held, in which the youths displayed their skill in archery; in the\nmanagement of chariots, horses, and elephants; in sword, spear, and club\nexercises, and in wrestling. "Arjuna, after exhibiting prodigies of strength,\nshot five arrows simultaneously into the jaws of a revolving iron boar, and\ntwenty-one arrows into the hollow of a cow\'s horn, suspended by a string."\nWhen he had accomplished this feat, Karma came and did precisely the same\ndeeds of skill, and challenged Arjuna to single combat; but as he could not\ntell his parentage, he was not considered worthy to enter the lists with the\nroyal youth.\n\nAfter the tournament was over, Yudhishthira was installed as heir apparent,\nand soon made his name even more famous than his father\'s had been. The people\nwished Yudhishthira to be crowned king at once, but the Kurus tried hard to\nprevent it. First of all, the P\xc4\x81ndus and their mother were sent to a house at\nV\xc4\x81ran\xc4\x81vata, in which a quantity of combustible materials was placed, with the\nintention of burning the whole family. The P\xc4\x81ndus were informed of this by\nVidura, and escaped; but the man who conducted them, and a woman with her five\nsons, whom Bh\xc4\xabma led there in a state of intoxication, were consumed instead.\nBy this device, the Kurus were under the impression that their plan had been\nsuccessful. The brothers, with their mother, now hastened to the woods, where\nBh\xc4\xabma slew a giant named Hidimba, and then married his sister.\n\nBy the advice of Vy\xc4\x81sa they now went to live in the city of Ekachakr\xc4\x81,\ndisguised as mendicant Br\xc4\x81hmans. Near this city was a R\xc4\x81kshas named Vaka, who\n\np. 418\n\ncompelled the citizens to send him a dish of food daily, and the messenger who\ntook it was devoured as the daintiest morsel of the whole. One day it happened\nthat the turn came to a Br\xc4\x81hman to supply the R\xc4\x81kshas with a meal. The man\ndetermined to go himself, but his wife and daughter each asked to be allowed\nto go with him. Lastly, the little son, too young to speak distinctly, in\nprattling accents said, "Weep not, father; sigh not, mother." Then, breaking\noff and brandishing a pointed spike of grass, he exclaimed, "With this spike\nwill I slay the fierce, man-eating giant." Bh\xc4\xabma, overhearing this, offered to\ngo; he went, and killed the giant.\n\nAfter this occurrence, Vy\xc4\x81sa appeared to his grandsons, and informed them that\nDraupadi, the daughter of Drupada, King of Panch\xc4\x81la, was destined to be their\ncommon wife. This girl, in a former birth, was the daughter of a sage, and had\nperformed a most severe penance in order that she might have a husband. Siva,\npleased with her devotion, said, "You shall have five husbands; for five times\nyou said, \'Give me a husband.\'" When the brothers returned from Draupadi\'s\nSvayambara (a tournament in which the princess chose for herself a husband),\nArjuna having been selected from amongst many suitors on account of his skill\nin archery, their mother, hearing their footsteps, and, fancying they were\nbringing alms, said, "Divide it amongst yourselves." The word of a mother\ncould not be set aside, so Vy\xc4\x81sa showed them that it was appointed that\nDraupadi should be the wife of each. At this tournament Arjuna displayed great\nskill in the use of the bow, by piercing a fish that was suspended in the air,\nwithout looking directly at the object; he saw its image only, reflected in a\npan of water on the ground.\n\nVy\xc4\x81sa, seeing the discrepancy between the conduct of\n\np. 419\n\n[![ARJUNA SHOOTING AT THE FISH](tn/41900.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/41900.jpg)  \nARJUNA SHOOTING AT THE FISH  \n\np. 420\n\nthe five brothers having a wife in common and that which prevailed in his day,\nexplains it by the fact that Arjuna was really a portion of the essence of\nIndra, and his brothers portions of the same god, whilst Draupadi herself was\na form of Lakshmi; as, therefore, the five brethren were parts of Indra, there\nwas no impropriety in their having but one wife. It is a fact to be noticed,\nthat to this day polyandry prevails amongst some of the hill-tribes of India.\nDraupadi is said to have had a son by each of the brothers, and the brothers\nhad other wives besides Draupadi. It was noticed above that Bh\xc4\xabma married\nHidimb\xc4\x81. Arjuna married Krishna\'s sister, Subhadr\xc4\x81, and also a serpent-nymph\nnamed Uludi, and Chitr\xc4\x81ngad\xc4\x81, daughter of the King of Manipura.\n\nWhen the P\xc4\x81ndus, by their marriage with Draupadi, had allied themselves with\nthe King of Panch\xc4\x81la, they threw off their disguise, and their uncle\nDhritar\xc4\x81shtra divided the kingdom: to his sons he gave Hastin\xc4\x81pur; to the\nP\xc4\x81ndus a district near the Yamuna (Jumna), called Kh\xc4\x81ndavaprastha. Here they\nbuilt Indraprastha (Delhi), and, under Yudhishthira, their kingdom grew.\n\nArjuna wandered in the forest alone for twelve years, in fulfilment of a vow,\nand there met Krishna, who invited him to Dw\xc4\x81raka, where he married Subhadr\xc4\x81.\nKrishna was invited to a great festival in honour of the inauguration of\nYudhishthira as sovereign. Acting on N\xc4\x81rada\'s advice, Bhishma proposed that an\noblation should be made to the best and strongest person present, and selected\nKrishna. Sisup\xc4\x81la objected, and, as he openly reviled Krishna, the deity\nstruck off his head with his discus.\n\nAfter this, a festival was held at Hastin\xc4\x81pur, to which the P\xc4\x81ndus were\ninvited. Yudhishthira was induced to\n\np. 421\n\nplay; and having staked his kingdom, his possessions, and, last of all,\nDraupadi, he lost everything. A compromise was effected. Duryodhana was made\nruler over the whole kingdom for twelve years; whilst the P\xc4\x81ndus with Draupadi\nwere to live in the forest for the same period, and to pass the thirteenth\nyear under assumed names, in various disguises. Whilst enjoying this forest\nlife, Arjuna went to the Himalayas to perform severe penance in order to\nobtain celestial arms. "After some time, Siva, to reward him and prove his\nbravery, approached as a Kir\xc4\x81t\xc4\x81, * or wild mountaineer, at the moment that a\ndemon named M\xc5\xabka, in the form of a boar, attacked him. Siva and Arjuna shot\ntogether at the boar, which fell dead, and both claimed to have hit him first.\nThis served as a pretext for Siva to have a battle with him. Arjuna fought\nlong with the Kir\xc4\x81t\xc4\x81 but could not conquer him. At last he recognized the god,\nand threw himself at his feet, when Siva, pleased with his bravery, gave him\nthe celebrated weapon P\xc4\x81supata, to enable him to conquer Karna and the Kuru\nprinces in war."\n\nIn the thirteenth year of exile the P\xc4\x81ndus journeyed to the court of King\nVir\xc4\x81ta, and entered his service in disguise. Yudhishthira called himself a\nBr\xc4\x81hman, and took the name of Kanka. Arjuna called himself Vrihanal\xc4\x81, and,\npretending to be a eunuch, adopted a sort of woman\'s dress, and taught music\nand dancing. One day when Vir\xc4\x81ta and four of the P\xc4\x81ndus were absent,\nDuryodhana and his brother attacked Vir\xc4\x81ta\'s capital, and carried off some\ncattle. Uttara, the king\'s son, followed them, having Arjuna as his\ncharioteer. When\n\np. 422\n\nthey came in sight of the enemy, Uttara\'s heart failed him. Arjuna changed\nplaces with him, having told him who he was. This gave him courage, the Kuru\narmy was defeated, and the stolen cattle reclaimed. Arjuna asked Uttara to\nkeep the secret of his real character for the present. A short time\nafterwards, at a great assembly called by Vir\xc4\x81ta, the P\xc4\x81ndus took their places\namongst the princes, and were welcomed heartily by the king.\n\nA council of princes was soon held, at which Krishna and Balar\xc4\x81ma were\npresent, to consider how the P\xc4\x81ndus could regain their possessions. Some were\nfor immediate war; Krishna and Balar\xc4\x81ma urged that attempts at negotiation\nshould first be made. This advice was acted upon, but without result. In the\nmean time, Krishna and his brother returned to Dw\xc4\x81raka. Not long after his\narrival at his capital, Duryodhana, the Kuru prince, visited Krishna to ask\nhis aid in the coming struggle; and on the same day, Arjuna, the P\xc4\x81ndu prince,\narrived there for the same purpose. And " it happened that they both reached\nthe door of Krishna\'s apartment, where he was asleep, at the same moment.\nDuryodhana succeeded in entering first, and took up his station at Krishna\'s\nhead; Arjuna followed, and stood reverently at his feet." Krishna, on awaking,\nfirst saw Arjuna; and when the cousins mentioned the object of their visit, he\ngave the right of choice to Arjuna. He offered himself to one side, but said\nhe should not himself fight; and to the other side his army of a hundred\nmillion warriors. Arjuna at once chose Krishna, and Duryodhana was delighted\nwith the prospect of having Krishna\'s immense army on his side. Duryodhana\nthen asked Balar\xc4\x81ma\'s aid, but was informed that both the brothers had decided\nto take no active part in the\n\np. 423\n\n[![BATTLE OF THE KURUS AND P\xc4\x80NDAVAS](tn/42300.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/42300.jpg)  \nBATTLE OF THE KURUS AND P\xc4\x80NDAVAS  \n\np. 424\n\nconflict. Krishna, however, consented to act as Arjuna\'s charioteer, and\njoined the P\xc4\x81ndus at Vir\xc4\x81ta\'s capital.\n\nFresh negotiations were commenced, and Krishna himself went as mediator to the\nKurus; but although in the assembly he assumed his divine form, and "Brahm\xc4\x81\nappeared in his forehead, Rudra on his breast, the guardians of the world\nissued from his arms, and Agni from his mouth"--although the other gods were\nvisible in and about his person--his attempt at reconciliation failed. War was\ndetermined on between the cousins. Bhishma was made the commander-in-chief of\nthe Kuru army; and Dhrishtadyumna, son of Drupada, was the leader of the\nP\xc4\x81ndus. Vy\xc4\x81sa offered to give sight to Dhritar\xc4\x81shtra, to enable him to witness\nthe conflict, but, as the blind man declined the offer, he gave to his\ncharioteer, Sanjaya, the faculty of knowing everything that took place, made\nhim invulnerable, and bestowed on him the power to transport himself by a\nthought to any part of the field of battle.\n\nThe armies met on Kurukshetra, a plain to the north-west of the modern Delhi,\nand we are told that "monstrous elephants career over the field, trampling on\nmen and horses, and dealing destruction with their huge tusks; enormous clubs\nand iron maces clash together with the noise of thunder; rattling chariots\ndash against each other; thousands of arrows hurtle in the air, darkening the\nsky; trumpets, kettledrums, and horns add to the uproar; confusion, carnage,\nand death are everywhere."\n\nThe P\xc4\x81ndus are described as performing prodigies of might. Arjuna killed five\nhundred warriors simultaneously, covered the plain with dead, and filled\nrivers with blood: Yudhishthira "slaughtered a hundred men" in a mere twinkle:\nBh\xc4\xabma annihilated a monstrous\n\np. 425\n\nelephant, including all mounted upon it, and fourteen foot soldiers besides,\nwith one blow of his club: Nakula and Sahadeva, when fighting from their\nchariots, cut off heads by the thousand, and sowed them like seed upon the\nground. Of the weapons employed, about a hundred are named; and the conch\nshell which served as the trumpet of each leader had its distinct name, as had\nalso the weapons of each of the chiefs.\n\nThe first great single combat was between Bhishma and Arjuna, which resulted\nin Bhishma being so transfixed with arrows that "there was not a space of two\nfingers\' breadth on his whole body unpierced. Falling from his chariot, his\nbody could not touch the ground, as it was surrounded by countless arrows, and\nthus it reclined on its arrowy couch. He had received from his father the\npower of fixing the time of his own death, and now declared that lie intended\nretaining life till the sun entered the summer solstice. The warriors on both\nsides ceased fighting that they might view the wonderful sight and do homage\nto their dying relative. As he lay on his uncomfortable bed, with his head\nhanging down, he begged for a pillow, whereupon the chiefs brought him soft\nsupports; these the hardy old soldier sternly rejected. Arjuna then made a\nrest for him with three arrows, which Bhishma quite approved; and soon\nafterwards asked him to bring a little water. Arjuna struck the ground with an\narrow, and forthwith a pure spring burst forth, which so refreshed Bhishma\nthat he called for Duryodhana, and begged him, before it was too late, to\nrestore half the kingdom to the P\xc4\x81ndavas."\n\nDrona, the tutor of the princes, is appointed to take the command of the Kuru\narmy after the fall of Bhishma; and a number of single combats are described.\nBh\xc4\xabma\'s\n\np. 426\n\nson by the R\xc4\x81kshasi Hidimb\xc4\x81 is slain by Karna; Drupada\'s son, Dhrishtadyumna,\nthe leader of the P\xc4\x81ndus, overcomes Drona; Drona being a Br\xc4\x81hman, when\noverpowered by his foe, voluntarily laid down his life, and is conducted to\nheaven "in a glittering shape like the sun," to save Dhrishtadyumna from the\nenormous crime of killing a Br\xc4\x81hman. Karna was then made leader of the Kurus\nin place of Drona. Bh\xc4\xabma next slew Duhs\xc4\x81sana, and remembering how this prince\nhad insulted Draupadi, he drank the blood of his fallen foe. Arjuna then slew\nKarna, and Salya, King of Madra, was appointed to fill the vacant post. Bh\xc4\xabma\nchallenges Salya, and the following is the account of their encounter:--\n\n"Soon as he saw his charioteer struck down,  \n Straightway the Madra monarch grasped his mace,  \n And like a mountain, firm and motionless,  \n Awaited the attack. The warrior\'s form  \n Was awful as the world-consuming fire,  \n Or as the noose-armed god of death, or as  \n The peaked Kail\xc4\x81sa, or the Thunderer  \n Himself, or as the trident-bearing god,  \n Or as a maddened forest elephant.  \n Him to defy did Bh\xc4\xabma hastily  \n Advance, wielding aloft his massive club.  \n A thousand conchs and trumpets, and a shout,  \n Firing each champion\'s ardour, rent the air.  \n From either host, spectators of the fight,  \n Burst forth applauding cheers: \'The Madra king  \n Alone,\' they cried, \'can bear the rush of Bh\xc4\xabma;\'  \n \'None but heroic Bh\xc4\xabma can sustain  \n The force of Salya.\' Now like two fierce bulls  \n Sprang they towards each other, mace in hand.  \n And first, as cautiously they circled round,  \n Whirling their weapons as in sport, the pair  \n Seemed matched in equal combat. Salya\'s club,  \n Set with red fillets, glittered as with flame,  \n While that of Bh\xc4\xabma gleamed like flashing lightning.\n\np. 427\n\n[paragraph continues]  Anon the clashing irons met, and scattered round  \n A fiery shower; then, fierce as elephants  \n Or butting bulls, they battered each the other.  \n Thick fell the blows, and soon each stalwart frame,  \n Spattered with gore, glowed like the Kinsuka,  \n Bedecked with scarlet blossoms; yet beneath  \n The rain of strokes, unshaken as a rock,  \n Bh\xc4\xabma sustained the mace of Salya, he  \n With equal firmness bore the other\'s blows.  \n Now, like the roar of crashing thunder-clouds,  \n Sounded the clashing iron; then, their clubs  \n Brandished aloft, eight paces they retired,  \n And swift again advancing to the fight,  \n Met in the midst like two huge mountain crags  \n Hurled into contact. Nor could either bear  \n The other\'s shock; together down they rolled,  \n Mangled and crushed, like two tall standards fallen."\n\nYudhishthira then fought with and eventually slew Salya. After suffering\ncontinual reverses, the Kurus rallied for a final charge, which led to so\ngreat a slaughter, that only four of their leaders, Duryodhana, Asvatth\xc4\x81man\n(son of Drona), Kritavarman, and Kripa remained, whilst "nothing remained of\neleven whole armies." Whereupon Duryodhana resolved upon flight, and taking\nrefuge in a lake, by his magical power supported it so as to form a chamber\nround his body. The P\xc4\x81ndus discovered his retreat; but when taunted by them,\nhe told them to take the kingdom, as, his brothers having all been slain, he\nhad no pleasure in life. At last, enraged by the sarcasms of his cousins, he\ncame forth and fought with Bh\xc4\xabma, from whom he received his death-wound. The\nremaining three Kuru chiefs left their wounded companion and took refuge in a\nforest.\n\nWhilst resting under a tree at night, Asvatth\xc4\x81man, seeing an owl approach\nstealthily and kill numbers of sleeping crows, the thought occurred to him\nthat in this manner he might destroy the P\xc4\x81ndu forces. Accordingly\n\np. 428\n\nhe quietly entered their camp, leaving Kripa and Kritavarman to watch the\ngates. Under cover of darkness they slew the whole army: the P\xc4\x81ndu princes and\nKrishna, happening to be stationed outside the camp, alone escaped. These\nthree then return to Duryodhana, and tell him what they had done. Hearing\ntheir narrative, his spirit revived for a moment; he thanked them, bade them\nfarewell, and expired.\n\nThe funeral obsequies of the chief are performed, and Yudhishthira is\ninstalled as King of Hastin\xc4\x81pur. But he is most unhappy as he thinks of the\ngreat slaughter that has taken place. Acting on Krishna\'s advice, he and his\nbrothers visit Bhishma, who is still lingering on his " spiky bed." For fifty-\neight nights he had lain there, and ere his departure gave utterance to a\nseries of most lengthy didactic discourses, after which his spirit ascended to\nthe skies.\n\nAs Yudhishthira was entering the capital in triumph, an incident occurred to\nlessen his joy in victory. A R\xc4\x81kshas named Ch\xc4\x81rv\xc4\x81ka, disguised as a Br\xc4\x81hman,\nmet him and reproached him for the slaughter he had caused; but the Br\xc4\x81hmans,\ndiscovering the imposture, consumed the R\xc4\x81kshas to ashes with fire from their\neyes. Yet even now the spirit of the king is not at rest. After a little time,\nhe resigns his kingdom, and, together with his brothers and Draupadi, starts\non his journey towards Indra\'s heaven on Mount Meru,\n\n"When the four brothers knew the high resolve of King Yudhishthira  \n Forthwith with Draupadi they issued forth, and after them a dog  \n Followed; the king himself went out the seventh from the royal city,  \n And all the citizens and women of the palace walked behind;  \n But none could find it in their heart to say unto the king,  \n Return.\' And so at length the train of citizens went back, bidding adieu."\n\nThese went, "bent on abandonment of worldly things;\n\np. 429\n\ntheir hearts yearning for union with the Infinite." In their journey they\nreach the sea, and there Arjuna cast away his bow and quiver. At last they\ncame in sight of Mount Meru, and Draupadi "lost hold of her high hope, and\nfaltering fell upon the earth." One by one the others fall, until only\nYudhishthira, Bh\xc4\xabma, and the dog are left. Bh\xc4\xabma cannot understand why such\npure beings should die: his brother informs him that Draupadi\'s fall was the\nresult of her excessive affection for Arjuna; that Sahadeva\'s death was the\nresult of pride in his own knowledge; that Nakula\'s personal vanity was his\nruin, and that Arjuna\'s fault was a boastful confidence in his power to\ndestroy his foes. Bh\xc4\xabma now falls, and is told that the reason of his death is\nhis selfishness, pride, and too great love of enjoyment. Yudhishthira, left\nalone with the dog, is walking on:\n\n"When, with a sudden sound that rang through earth and heaven, the mighty god  \n Came towards him in a chariot, and he cried, Ascend, O resolute prince.\'  \n Then did the king look back upon his fallen brothers, and addressed  \n These words unto the Thousand-eyed in anguish; \'Let my brothers here  \n Come with me. Without them, O god of gods, I could not wish to enter  \n E\'en heaven! and yonder tender princess Draupadi, the faithful wife,  \n Worthy of endless bliss, let her come too. In mercy hear my prayer.\'"\n\nIndra informs him that the spirits of Draupadi and his brothers are already in\nheaven, but that he alone is permitted to enter in bodily form. The king asks\nthat the dog may accompany him. But as this is refused, he declines to go\nalone. Indra says, "You have abandoned your brothers; why not forsake the\ndog?" Yudhishthira replies, "I had no power to bring them back to\n\np. 430\n\nlife: how can there be abandonment of those who no longer live?" It now\nappears that the dog was no other than his father Dharma in disguise; who,\nassuming his proper form, enters with him.\n\nOn reaching heaven, though Duryodhana and his cousins are already in bliss, as\nhe does not see Arjuna and the rest, Yudhishthira declines to remain there\nwithout them. An angel accompanies him to hell, where he hears their voices\ncalling upon him for help. He therefore bids the angel depart, as he prefers\nto suffer in hell with his brethren rather than to remain in heaven without\nthem. As soon as his resolution is taken, the scene suddenly changes, and it\nappears that this was simply a trial of his faith. He bathes in the heavenly\nGanges, and in heaven, with " Draupadi and his brothers, finds the rest and\nhappiness that were unattainable on earth."\n\n![](img/43000.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[411:*](hmvp41.htm#fr_389) This account of the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata is taken in an\nabbreviated form almost entirely from Lecture XIII. of Monier Williams\'s\n"Indian Wisdom."\n\n[411:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp41.htm#fr_390) An interesting story is told of Puru. His father,\nYay\xc4\x81ti, married Devay\xc4\x81ni, daughter of Sukra, the preceptor of the Daityas. Her\nhusband loving her servant Sarmisth\xc4\x81 also, Puru was born as their youngest\nson. The wife being highly indignant at the unfaithfulness of her husband,\nreturning to her father\'s home, so excited the old priest that he cursed\nYay\xc4\x81ti with old age; but afterwards consented to withdraw the curse provided\none of his sons would bear it for him. They all refused to do this excepting\nPuru. As a reward for his piety, his father disinherited his other sons, and\nmade Puru sole heir to his dominions.\n\n[412:*](hmvp41.htm#fr_391) Satyavati was the daughter of an Apsaras named\nAdrik\xc4\x81, who was condemned to live on earth in the form of a fish. Paras\xc4\x81ra, a\nsage, met her daughter as he was crossing the river Yamun\xc4\x81, and Vy\xc4\x81sa was the\nresult. He was born on an island of the river, and hence he had the name\nDwaip\xc4\x81yana (who moves on an island). Vy\xc4\x81sa is said to have been the arranger\nof the Vedas, the compiler of the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata and the Pur\xc4\x81nas, and the founder\nof the Vedanta system of philosophy.\n\n[421:*](hmvp41.htm#fr_392) The Kir\xc4\x81t\xc4\x81s were mountaineers, or foresters. In the\nR\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana they are described as "islanders, who eat raw flesh, live in the\nwaters, and are men-tigers."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter V. The Planets](hmvp42.htm)\n\n'
