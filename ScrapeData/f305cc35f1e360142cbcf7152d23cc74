Three for the fathers, one for the (newly) dead person,\n\n6\\. And pours the pot that belongs to the (newly) dead person out into the\npots of the fathers with the two verses, 'They who commonly' (Va _g_ asaneyi\nSa _m_ hita XIX, 45. 46).\n\n7\\. Thus also the lump (of flour).\n\n8\\. This is the Sapi _n_ _d_ ikara _n_ a.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[109:1](sbe29065.htm#fr_241) 3, 1. It appears to me that this whole chapter is\na later addition to the original text. The last Sutra of the preceding\nchapter, treating of the omission of the fourth 'father,' which forms, as\nshown in the preceding note, a consequence of the Sapi _n_ _d_ ikara _n_ a, p.\n110 supposes this ceremony to be known and to require no special explanation.\nHad the intention of the author been to treat of the Sapi _n_ _d_ ikara _n_ a,\nthis would have been the right place for mentioning the _k_ aturthavisarga,\nand not, as we really read it, the end of the chapter treating of the Ekoddish\n_t_ a. As pointing in the same direction I will mention that the _S_ ambavya-G\n_ri_ hya, while giving the first, second, and fourth chapter of this Adhyaya,\nomits the third. Finally it seems decisive to me that the fifth (Pari _s_ ish\n_t_ a) book of the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya treats of the Sapi _n_ _d_ ikara\n_n_ a in a whole chapter (V, 9), which shows that the text itself, as the\nauthor of the Pari _s_ ish _t_ a read it, gave no exposition of this ceremony.\n\n[110:2](sbe29065.htm#fr_242) Naraya _n_ a says that tripaksha means either\nthree pakshas, i.e. one month and a half, or one paksha deficient by three\ndays, i.e. twelve days. We need not say that the latter explanation is\ninadmissible it evidently rests on a wrong conclusion drawn from a passage of\nanother Sutra quoted by him, in which it is stated that the Sapi _n_ _d_ ikara\n_n_ a should be performed sa _m_ vatsarante dvada _s_ ahe va.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 4](sbe29066.htm)\n\n"
