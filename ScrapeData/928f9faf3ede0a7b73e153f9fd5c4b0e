On account of the impossibility of the origination (of the individual\nsoul from the highest Lord, the doctrine of the Bhagavatas cannot be\naccepted).\n\nWe have, in what precedes, refuted the opinion of those who think that the\nLord is not the material cause but only the ruler, the operative cause of the\nworld. We are now\n\np. 440\n\ngoing to refute the doctrine of those according to whom he is the material as\nwell as the operative cause.--But, it may be objected, in the previous\nportions of the present work a Lord of exactly the same nature, i.e. a Lord\nwho is the material, as well as the operative, cause of the world, has been\nascertained on the basis of Scripture, and it is a recognised principle that\nSm _ri_ ti, in so far as it agrees with Scripture, is authoritative; why then\nshould we aim at controverting the doctrine stated?--It is true, we reply,\nthat a part of the system which we are going to discuss agrees with the\nVedanta system, and hence affords no matter for controversy; another part of\nthe system, however, is open to objection, and that part we intend to attack.\n\nThe so-called Bhagavatas are of opinion that the one holy (bhagavat) Vasudeva,\nwhose nature is pure knowledge, is what really exists, and that he, dividing\nhimself fourfold, appears in four forms (vyuha), as Vasudeva, Sa _n_ karsha\n_n_ a, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha. Vasudeva denotes the highest Self, Sa _n_\nkarsha _n_ a the individual soul, Pradyumna the mind (manas), Aniruddha the\nprinciple of egoity (aha _n_ kara). Of these four Vasudeva constitutes the\nultimate causal essence, of which the three others are the effects.--The\nbeliever after having worshipped Vasudeva for a hundred years by means of\napproach to the temple (abhigamana), procuring of things to be offered\n(upadana), oblation (i _g_ ya), recitation of prayers, &c. (svadhyaya), and\ndevout meditation (yoga), passes beyond all affliction and reaches the highest\nBeing.\n\nConcerning this system we remark that we do not intend to controvert the\ndoctrine that Naraya _n_ a, who is higher than the Undeveloped, who is the\nhighest Self, and the Self of all, reveals himself by dividing himself in\nmultiple ways; for various scriptural passages, such as 'He is onefold, he is\nthreefold' ( _Kh_. Up. VII, 26, 2)', teach us that the highest Self appears in\nmanifold forms. Nor do we mean to object to the inculcation of unceasing\nconcentration of mind on the highest Being which appears in the Bhagavata\ndoctrine under the forms of reverential approach,\n\np. 441\n\n[paragraph continues] &c.; for that we are to meditate on the Lord we know\nfull well from Sm _ri_ ti and Scripture. We, however, must take exception to\nthe doctrine that Sa _n_ karsha _n_ a springs from Vasudeva, Pradyumna from Sa\n_n_ karsha _n_ a, Aniruddha from Pradyumna. It is not possible that from\nVasudeva, i.e. the highest Self, there should originate Sa _n_ karsha _n_ a,\ni.e. the individual soul; for if such were the case, there would attach to the\nsoul non-permanency, and all the other imperfections which belong to things\noriginated. And thence release, which consists in reaching the highest Being,\ncould not take place; for the effect is absorbed only by entering into its\ncause.--That the soul is not an originated thing, the teacher will prove later\non (II, 3, 17). For this reason the Bhagavata hypothesis is unacceptable.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 43](sbe34219.htm)\n\n"
