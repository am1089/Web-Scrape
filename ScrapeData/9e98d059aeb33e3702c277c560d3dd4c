Not the other, on account of impossibility.\n\nThe other than the highest Self, i.e. the one called _g_ iva, even in the\nstate of release, is not that Self which the mantra describes; for this is not\npossible. For to a Self of that kind unconditioned intelligence (such as is,\nin the mantra, ascribed to Brahman; cp. the term 'vipa _sk_ ita') cannot\nbelong. Unconditioned intelligence is illustrated by the power of all one's\npurposes realising themselves; as expressed in the text 'He desired, may I be\nmany, may I grow forth.' Intelligence (vipa _sk_ ittvam, i.e. power of insight\ninto various things) does indeed belong to the soul in the state of release;\nbut as in the Sa _m_ sara state the same soul is devoid of such insight, we\ncannot ascribe to it non-conditioned intelligence. And if the released soul is\nviewed as being mere non-differenced intelligence, it does not possess the\ncapacity of seeing different things, and hence cannot of course possess vipa\n_sk_ ittva in the sense stated above. That, however, the existence of a\nsubstance devoid of all difference cannot be proved by any means of knowledge,\nwe have already shown before. Again, if the clause 'from whence speech\nreturns,' &c., were meant to express that speech and mind return from Brahman,\nthis could not mean that the Real is devoid of all difference, but only that\nmind and speech are not means for the knowledge of Brahman. And from this it\nwould follow that Brahman is something altogether empty, futile. Let us\nexamine the context. The whole section, beginning with 'He who knows Brahman\nreaches Brahman,' declares that Brahman is all-knowing, the cause of the\nworld, consisting of pure bliss, the cause of bliss in others; that through\nits mere wish it creates the whole universe comprising matter and souls; that\nentering into the universe of created things it constitutes their Self; that\nit is the cause of fear and fearlessness; that it rules Vayu\n\np. 235\n\n[paragraph continues] \xc3\x82ditya and other divine beings; that its bliss is ever\nso much superior to all other bliss; and many other points. Now, all at once,\nthe clause 'from whence speech returns' is said to mean that neither speech\nnor mind applies to Brahman, and that thus there are no means whatever of\nknowing Brahman! This is idle talk indeed! In the clause '(that) from which\nspeech returns,' the relative pronoun 'from which' denotes bliss; this bliss\nis again explicitly referred to in the clause 'knowing the bliss of Brahman'--\nthe genitive 'of Brahman' intimating that the bliss belongs to Brahman; what\nthen could be the meaning of this clause which distinctly speaks of a\nknowledge of Brahman, if Brahman had at the same time to be conceived as\ntranscending all thought and speech? What the clause really means rather is\nthat if one undertakes to state the definite amount of the bliss of Brahman--\nthe superabundance of which is illustrated by the successive multiplications\nwith hundred--mind and speech have to turn back powerless, since no such\ndefinite amount can be assigned. He who knows the bliss of Brahman as not to\nbe defined by any definite amount, does not fear anything.--That, moreover,\nthe all-wise being referred to in the mantra is other than the individual soul\nin the state of release, is rendered perfectly clear by what--in passages such\nas 'it desired,' &c.--is said about its effecting, through its mere volition,\nthe origination and subsistence of the world, its being the inner Self of the\nworld, and so on.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 18.
