The flesh, &c., originates from earth, according to the scriptural\nstatement; and (so also) in the case of the two other (elements).\n\nFrom tripartite earth when assimilated by man there are produced as its\neffects flesh, &c., according to scripture. For the text says, 'Food (earth)\nwhen eaten becomes threefold; its grossest portion becomes feces, its middle\nportion flesh, its subtlest portion mind.' The meaning is that the tripartite\nearth is eaten in the shape of food such as rice, barley, &c.; that its\ngrossest parts are discharged in the form of feces, that its middle parts\nnourish the flesh of the body, and its subtlest parts feed the mind.\nAnalogously we have to learn from the text the effects of the two other\nelements, viz. fire and water; viz. that urine, blood, and breath are the\neffects of water; bone, marrow, and speech those of fire.--Here now an\nobjection is raised. If all material things are tripartite (i.e. contain parts\nof the three elements alike)--according to the indifferent statement, 'He made\neach of these tripartite'--for what reason then has there been made the\ndistinction of names, 'this is fire, this is water, this is earth?' And,\nagain, why is it said that among the elements of the human body, flesh, &c.,\nis the effect of the eaten earth only; blood, &c, the effect of the water\ndrunk; bone, &c., the effect of the fire eaten?--To this objection the next\nSutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 4, 22](sbe38076.htm)\n\n"
