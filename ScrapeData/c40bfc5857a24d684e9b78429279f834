In the morning they brought to Manu 1 water for washing, just as\nnow also they (are wont to) bring (water) for washing the hands. When he was\nwashing himself, a fish came into his hands.\n\n1:8:1:22\\. It spake to him the word, \'Rear me, I will save thee!\' \'Wherefrom\nwilt thou save me?\' \'A flood will carry away all these creatures 2: from that\nI will save thee!\' \'How am I to rear thee?\'\n\n1:8:1:33\\. It said, \'As long as we are small, there is great destruction for\nus: fish devours fish. Thou wilt first keep me in a jar. When I outgrow that,\nthou wilt dig a pit and keep me in it. When I outgrow that, thou wilt take me\ndown to the sea, for then I shall be beyond destruction.\'\n\n1:8:1:44\\. It soon became a _gh_ asha (a large fish); for that grows largest\n(of all fish) 3. Thereupon it said, \'In such and such a year that flood will\ncome. Thou\n\np. 217\n\nshalt then attend to me (i.e. to my advice) by preparing a ship 1; and when\nthe flood has risen thou shalt enter into the ship, and I will save thee from\nit.\'\n\n1:8:1:55\\. After he had reared it in this way, he took it down to the sea. And\nin the same year which the fish had indicated to him, he attended to (the\nadvice of the fish) by preparing a ship; and when the flood had risen, he\nentered into the ship. The fish then swam up to him, and to its horn he tied\nthe rope of the ship, and by that means he 2 passed swiftly up to yonder\nnorthern mountain.\n\n1:8:1:66\\. It then said, \'I have saved thee. Fasten the ship to a tree; but\nlet not the water cut thee off 3, whilst thou art on the mountain. As the\nwater\n\np. 218\n\nsubsides, thou mayest gradually descend!\' Accordingly he gradually descended,\nand hence that (slope) of the northern mountain is called \'Alarm\'s descent 1.\'\nThe flood then swept away all these creatures, and Manu alone remained here.\n\n1:8:1:77\\. Being desirous of offspring, he engaged in worshipping and\nausterities. During this time he also performed a paka-sacrifice: he offered\nup in the waters clarified butter, sour milk, whey, and curds. Thence a woman\nwas produced in a year: becoming quite solid 2 she rose; clarified butter\ngathered in her footprint. Mitra and Varu _n_ a met her.\n\n1:8:1:88\\. They said to her, \'Who art thou?\' \'Manu\'s daughter,\' she replied.\n\'Say (thou art) ours,\' they said. \'No,\' she said, \'I am (the daughter) of him\nwho begat me.\' They desired to have a share in her. She either agreed or did\nnot agree 3, but passed by them. She came to Manu.\n\n1:8:1:99\\. Manu said to her, \'Who art thou?\' \'Thy daughter,\' she replied.\n\'How, illustrious one, (art thou) my daughter?\' he asked. She replied,\n\np. 219\n\n[paragraph continues] \'Those offerings (of) clarified butter, sour milk, whey,\nand curds, which thou madest in the waters, with them thou hast begotten me. I\nam the blessing (benediction): make use of me at the sacrifice! If thou wilt\nmake use of me at the sacrifice, thou wilt become rich in offspring and\ncattle. Whatever blessing thou shalt invoke through me, all that shall be\ngranted to thee!\' He accordingly made use of her (as the benediction) in the\nmiddle of the sacrifice; for what is intermediate between the fore-offerings\nand the after-offerings, is the middle of the sacrifice.\n\n1:8:1:1010\\. With her he went on worshipping and performing austerities,\nwishing for offspring. Through her he generated this race, which is this race\nof Manu; and whatever blessing he invoked through her, all that was granted to\nhim.\n\n1:8:1:1111\\. Now this (daughter of Manu) is essentially the same as the I _d_\na; and whosoever, knowing this, performs with (the) I _d_ a 1, he propagates\nthis race which Manu generated; and whatever blessing he invokes through it\n(or her), all that is granted to him.\n\n1:8:1:1212\\. It (the i _d_ a) consists of a fivefold cutting; for the i _d_ a,\ndoubtless, means cattle, and cattle consist of five parts 2: for this reason\nit (the i _d_ a) consists of a fivefold cutting.\n\n1:8:1:1313\\. When he (the Adhvaryu) has cut off the i _d_ a piece by piece 3,\nand broken off the fore-part of the\n\np. 220\n\ncake (for the sacrificer\'s portion), he puts it (the latter) down (on the\nbarhis) before the dhruva-spoon. Having then handed over the former (the i _d_\na) to the Hot _ri_  1, he passes by him towards the south.\n\n1:8:1:1414\\. He anoints the Hot _ri_ here 2 (with clarified butter taken from\nthe i _d_ a); and with it the Hot _ri_ anoints his lips, with the text, \'Of\nthee, offered by the lord of the mind, I eat for sap, for out-breathing!\'\n\n1:8:1:1515\\. He then anoints the Hot _ri_ here 2; and with it the Hot _ri_\nanoints his lips, with the text, \'Of thee, offered by the lord of speech, I\neat for strength, for in-breathing!\'\n\n1:8:1:1616\\. At that time, namely, Manu became apprehensive (thinking), \'This\n(part) of my sacrifice--that is, this i _d_ a representing the domestic\noffering--is certainly the weakest: the Rakshas must not\n\np. 221\n\ninjure my sacrifice at this place.\' Accordingly by that (butter, taken from\nthe i _d_ a, and smeared on his lips) he promoted it (the i _d_ a to a safe\nplace, thinking), \'Before the Rakshas (come)! before the Rakshas (come)!\' And\nin like manner this one also thereby promotes (the i _d_ a to a safe place,\nthinking), \'Before the Rakshas (come)! before the Rakshas (come)!\' And though\nhe does not (at present) eat (the i _d_ a) visibly, lest he should eat it\nbefore it is invoked, he nevertheless promotes it (to a safe place), when he\nsmears the (butter) on his lips.\n\n1:8:1:1717\\. He now cuts off piece by piece (the avantare _d_ a) in (or, into)\nthe Hot _ri_ \'s hand. That which is cut up piece by piece he thus makes\nvisibly enter 1 the Hot _ri_ ; and through that which has entered (or is\ncooked in) his own self, the Hot _ri_ invokes a blessing on the sacrificer:\nfor this reason he cuts it off piece by piece in the Hot _ri_ \'s hand 2.\n\n1:8:1:1818\\. He now calls 3 (the i _d_ a) in a low voice. At that time,\nnamely, Manu became apprehensive (thinking), \'This (part) of my sacrifice--\nthat is, this i _d_ a\n\np. 222\n\nrepresenting the domestic offerings--is certainly the weakest: the Rakshas\nmust not injure my sacrifice at this place.\' He accordingly called it to him\nin a low voice (thinking), \'Before the Rakshas (come)! before the Rakshas\n(come)!\' And in like manner this one (the Hot _ri_ ) thereby calls it\n(thinking), \'Before the Rakshas (come)! before the Rakshas (come)!\'\n\n1:8:1:1919\\. He calls thus (in a low voice) 1, \'Hither is called the\nRathantara (chant), together with the earth: may the Rathantara, together with\nthe earth, call me 2! Hither is called the Vamadevya (chant), together with\nthe atmosphere: may the Vamadevya, together with the atmosphere, call me!\nHither is called the B _ri_ hat (chant), together with the sky: may the B _ri_\nhat, together with the sky, call me!\' In thus calling her (the I _d_ a) to\nhim, he calls to him both these (three) worlds and those chants 3.\n\n1:8:1:2020\\. \'Hither are called the cows 4, together with the\n\np. 223\n\nbull!\'--the i _d_ a, assuredly, means cattle: hence it is her he thereby calls\nin an indirect (mystic) way; (and in saying), \'together with the bull,\' he\ncalls her together with her mate.\n\n1:8:1:2121\\. \'Hither is called (I _d_ a) by that (sacrifice) which is\nperformed by the seven Hot _ri_ s!\'--he thereby calls her by the Soma-\nsacrifice performed by the seven Hot _ri_ s 1.\n\n1:8:1:2222\\. \'Hither is called I _d_ a, the conquering!\'--he thereby calls her\ndirectly. \'Conquering\' he says, because she overcomes evil, and for that\nreason he calls her \'the conquering.\'\n\n1:8:1:2323\\. \'Hither is called the friend, the food 2!\'--the friend, the food,\ndoubtless, means breath: hence he thereby calls hither the breath. \'Hither is\ncalled the Hek 3!\'--he thereby calls hither the (body of i _d_ a), he thereby\ncalls hither the entire (i _d_ a).\n\n1:8:1:2424\\. He now intones (in a loud voice): \'I _d_ a is called hither!\nHither (thither) is called I _d_ a! May I _d_ a also call us to her!\' In\nsaying, \'I _d_ a is called\n\np. 224\n\nhither,\' he, in a direct way, calls her, who is thereby called hither, as\nbeing what she really was: a cow, assuredly, she was, and a cow is four-\nfooted; and therefore he calls her four times 1.\n\n1:8:1:2525\\. But in calling her four times, he calls her in different ways, in\norder to avoid repetition (of sacrificial performance); for, if he were to\ncall, \'I _d_ a is called hither! I _d_ a is called hither!\' or \'Hither is\ncalled Ida! hither is called I _d_ a!\' he would indeed commit the (fault of)\nrepetition. By saying, \'I _d_ a is called hither!\' he calls her hitherwards;\nand by \'Hither (or thither, lit. called to somebody) is called I _d_ a!\' he\ncalls her thitherwards. By saying, \'May I _d_ a also call us to her,\' he does\nnot omit himself, and, besides, it (the formula) is changed. By (the second),\n\'I _d_ a is called hither!\' he again calls her hitherwards; so that he thereby\n(and by the second, \'Hither is called I _d_ a,\' again) calls her hitherwards\nand thitherwards.\n\n1:8:1:2626\\. \'Manu\'s daughter, the butter-pathed (gh _ri_ tapadi);\'--Manu,\nindeed, begat her of old: for this reason he says, \'Manu\'s daughter.\' \'The\nbutter-pathed\' he says, because butter gathered in her footprint: therefore he\ncalls her \'butter-pathed.\'\n\n1:8:1:2727\\. And further, \'She who belongs to Mitra and Varu _n_ a;\'--this\n\'Maitravaru _n_ a nature\' (is hers), because she met Mitra and Varu _n_ a\n2.--\'She, the god-fashioned one, is called hither as the Brahman 3;\n\np. 225\n\nfor she, the god-fashioned one, is indeed called hither as their\nBrahman.--\'Hither are called the divine Adhvaryus, called hither the human!\'--\nhe thereby calls both the divine Adhvaryus and those that are human: the\ndivine Adhvaryus indeed are the calves 1 (vatsa _h_ ), and what others there\nare, are the human ones.\n\n1:8:1:2828\\. \'--They who are to prosper this sacrifice, they who are to\nprosper the lord of sacrifice.\' Those Brahma _n_ as, who have studied and\nteach the Veda, assuredly prosper the sacrifice, since they spread (perform)\nand produce it: these he thereby propitiates. And the calves also assuredly\nmake the lord of sacrifice prosper; for the lord of sacrifice who possesses\nabundance of them, does indeed prosper; for this reason he says, \'They who are\nto prosper the lord of sacrifice.\'\n\n1:8:1:2929\\. \'Hither are called the primeval, law-abiding, divine (fem.)\nheaven and earth, whose sons are gods.\' He thereby calls to him those two,\nheaven and earth, within which all this (universe) is embraced.--\'Hither is\ncalled this sacrificer:\' thereby he calls the sacrificer to him. Why he does\nnot mention his name on this occasion, is that this is a mysterious\nbenediction on the i _d_ a. Were he, on the contrary, to mention the name, he\nwould do what is human, and the human certainly is inauspicious at the\nsacrifice: hence he does not mention\n\np. 226\n\nthe name, lest he should do what is inauspicious at the sacrifice 1.\n\n1:8:1:3030\\. \'Hither (he is) called for future worship of the gods;\' he\nthereby in a mysterious manner invokes the blessing of life on this\n(sacrificer); for as he sacrificed heretofore, so, while living, he will\nsacrifice hereafter.\n\n1:8:1:3131\\. Moreover, he thereby in a mysterious manner invokes the blessing\nof offspring for him; for whosoever has offspring,--while he, on his part,\ngoes to yonder world, his offspring sacrifice in this world: hence future\nworship of the gods means offspring.\n\n1:8:1:3232\\. Moreover, he thereby in a mysterious manner invokes the blessing\nof cattle for him; for whosoever has cattle, will sacrifice hereafter, as he\nhas sacrificed heretofore.\n\n1:8:1:3333\\. \'Hither (he is) called for more abundant havis-offering;\' he\nthereby in a mysterious manner invokes the blessing of life on him; for as he\nhas sacrificed heretofore, so while living will he hereafter again and again\nmake offerings.\n\n1:8:1:3434\\. Moreover, he thereby in a mysterious manner invokes the blessing\nof offspring for this (sacrificer); for whosoever possesses offspring,--though\nhe, of his own self, be one only, yet that offering is made tenfold by his\noffspring: hence offspring means more abundant offering.\n\n1:8:1:3535\\. Moreover, he thereby in a mysterious manner invokes the blessing\nof cattle for him; for whosoever possesses cattle, will make offering again\nand again, as he has sacrificed heretofore.\n\n1:8:1:3636\\. This then is the benediction (implied in these formulas), \'May I\nlive, may I have offspring, may\n\np. 227\n\n[paragraph continues] I obtain prosperity!\' Now in praying for the blessing of\ncattle, he prays for prosperity; for cattle means prosperity: hence through\nthese two benedictions everything is obtained; and therefore these two\nbenedictions are here pronounced.\n\n1:8:1:3737\\. [He continues to call], \'Hither (he is) called to this\n(sacrifice, for the prayer 1), "May the gods graciously accept this my\noffering (havis)!\'\'\' he thereby invokes complete success on the sacrifice; for\nwhat offering the gods graciously accept, by that one gains great things: for\nthis reason he says, \'may they graciously accept 2.\'\n\n1:8:1:3838\\. They (the priests and sacrificer) eat it (the i _d_ a), and do\nnot offer it up in the fire; for assuredly the i _d_ a means cattle: hence\nthey do not offer it in the fire, lest they should throw the cattle into the\nfire.\n\n39\\. In the vital airs rather it is offered, partly in the Hot _ri_ , partly\nin the Sacrificer, partly in the Adhvaryu. Now, when he has broken off the\nforepart of the (Agni) cake, he places it before the dhruva-spoon. But the\ndhruva represents the sacrificer: hence this will be eaten by the sacrificer.\nAnd if he does not now visibly eat it, lest he should eat before the sacrifice\nis completed, it nevertheless is now (symbolically) eaten by him. All of them\n\np. 228\n\neat (of the i _d_ a): \'May it be offered for me in all!\' thus (he thinks).\nFive eat of it,--the i _d_ a indeed means cattle, and cattle are fivefold:\nhence five eat of it.\n\n1:8:1:4040\\. Now when he (the Hot _ri_ ) intones (in a loud voice) 1, he (the\nAdhvaryu) divides the (Agni) cake into four parts, and lays it on the barhis\n(the sacrificial grass covering the altar). Here it lies in place of the\nfathers; for there are four intermediate quarters, and the intermediate\nquarters represent the fathers: for this reason he divides the cake into four\nparts, and lays it on the barhis 2.\n\np. 229\n\n1:8:1:4141\\. And when he recites, \'Hither are called heaven and earth,\' he\nhands it (the sha _d_ avatta 1) to the \xc3\x82gnidhra. The \xc3\x82gnidhra eats (the two\npieces), with the respective texts (Va _g_. S. II, 10-11), \'Hither is called\nmother Earth; may mother Earth call me to her! Agni (am I) by virtue of my\n\xc3\x82gnidhraship. Hail!\' \'Hither is called father Heaven; may father Heaven call\nme to him! Agni (am I) by virtue of my \xc3\x82gnidhraship. Hail!\' He, the \xc3\x82gnidhra,\ntruly is the representative of heaven and earth, and therefore he eats (the\nsha _d_ avatta) in this manner.\n\n1:8:1:4242\\. And when (the Hot _ri_ ) pronounces the benediction 2, then (the\nsacrificer) mutters (Va _g_. S. II, 10 a), \'May Indra bestow on me that power\nof his! may abundant riches accrue to us! may there be blessings for us! may\nthere be true blessings for us!\' For indeed this is a receiving of blessings:\nhence what blessings the priests on this occasion invoke on him, those he\nthereby receives and makes his own.\n\n1:8:1:4343\\. [On the conclusion of the invocation and the eating 3] they\ncleanse themselves (with water poured)\n\np. 230\n\nthrough the two strainers (pavitra, \'purifier\'). For they have now performed\nthe i _d_ a, which represents the domestic offerings; and thinking, \'Purified\nby the purifiers we will now perform what part of the sacrifice remains still\nunaccomplished,\' they cleanse themselves with the strainers.\n\n1:8:1:4444\\. He (the Adhvaryu) then throws the two strainers on the prastara\n1. The prastara, doubtless, represents the sacrificer, and the two strainers\nthe out-breathing and in-breathing: hence he thereby invokes out-breathing and\nin-breathing on the sacrificer; and for this reason he throws the strainers on\nthe prastara.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[216:1](sbe1234.htm#fr_506) For other translations of this important legend of\nthe deluge, see A. Weber, Ind. Streifen, I, p. 9 (Ind. Stud. I, 161 seq:).;\nMax Muller, History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 425; J. Muir, Original\nSanskrit Texts, I, p. 182. For the later versions of the same legend,\nespecially the one from the Mahabharata (Vanaparvan 22747-12802), see Original\nSanskrit Texts, I, p. 196 seq.\n\n[216:2](sbe1234.htm#fr_507) According to the scholiast, \'it will carry away\nall these creatures that live in Bharatavarsha to some other country.\'\n\n[216:3](sbe1234.htm#fr_508) ? Sa _s_ vad dha _gh_ asha asa, sa hi _g_ yesh\n_th_ a _m_ vardhate \'thetithi _m_ sama _m_ tad augha aganta. \'Bald war er ein\nGrossfisch ( _gh_ asha), denn er wuchs gewaltig,\' Weber. \'He became soon a\nlarge fish. He said to Manu, "When I am full-grown, in the same year the flood\nwill come,"\' Max Muller. \'Straightway he became a large fish; for he waxes to\nthe utmost,\' Muir. Perhaps _gh_ asha is here intended for the name of some\nfabulous horned fish (cf. _s_ _ri_ \xe1\xb9\x85gi, _s_ _ri_ \xe1\xb9\x85gi). In the Black Ya _g_ ur-\nveda (Taitt. S. I, 7, 1; II, 6, 7) the p. 217 i _d_ a is represented as a cow,\nproduced by Mitra and Varu _n_ a (see below, par. 24). Perhaps it was this\nversion and the symbolical representation of the i _d_ a as meaning cattle,\nwhich suggested the notion of a horned fish, in adapting an older legend.\n\n[217:1](sbe1234.htm#fr_509) I adopt here, though not without hesitation, the\ninterpretation proposed in the St. Petersb. Dict. (s.v. upa-as), which the\nseparation of mam from the verb favours. Professor Max Muller translates:\n\'Build a ship then, and worship me.\' Dr. Muir: \'Thou shalt, therefore,\nconstruct a ship, and resort to me.\' The Mahabharata has: \'When standing on\nthe ship, thou shalt look out for me: I shall be recognisable (by my being)\nfurnished with a horn,\' which, after all, may furnish the correct explanation\nof our passage.\n\n[217:2](sbe1234.htm#fr_510) Or, \'it,\' that is, either the ship, or the fish.\nThat abhi-dudrava, the reading of the Ka _n_ va school, is the right one,\nseems to follow from the next paragraph. Professor Weber\'s edition has ati-\ndudrava, as read by his best MS., \'it (or he) sailed across the mountain.\' The\nreading of the other MSS. adhi-dudrava must be a clerical error, most likely\nfor abhi-dudrava. Professor Muller translates: \'The fish carried him by it\nover the northern mountain.\' Dr. Muir: \'By this means he passed over (or, he\nhastened to) this northern mountain.\'\n\n[217:3](sbe1234.htm#fr_511) Anta _s_ _kh_ aitsit,? \'cut thee asunder,\' Max\nMuller; \'wash thee away;\' \'fortspult,\' Weber; \'abschneiden, intercludere,\' St.\nPetersb. Dict. I adopt this last meaning, = \'leave thee stranded.\'\n\n[218:1](sbe1234.htm#fr_512) According to the version of the Mahabharata, \'the\npeak of the Himalaya to which the ship was tied, was afterwards called\nnaubandhana, \'the tying of the ship.\' Professor Weber also draws attention to\nAth.-veda XIX, 39, 8, where the term navaprabhra _m_ _s_ ana or \'gliding down\nof the ship\' is used in connection with the summit of the Himavat.\n\n[218:2](sbe1234.htm#fr_513) Pibdamana-iva, as taken by the St. Petersb. Dict.\nThe meaning \'dripping with fat, unctuous,\' offered by the commentator, was\nprobably suggested to him by what follows in the text; and by the cow-version\n(p. 216, note 3), Taitt. Br. II, 6, 7, 1.\n\n[218:3](sbe1234.htm#fr_514) Or, as the commentator takes it, \'she both\npromised and did not promise it;\' that is to say, she promised, inasmuch as\nshe (I _d_ a) is called maitravaru _n_ i (belonging to, or the daughter of,\nMitra or Varu _n_ a; see XIV, 9, 4, 27), but refused, inasmuch as Mitra and\nVaru _n_ a have no share in the in portions.\n\n[219:1](sbe1234.htm#fr_515) I _d_ aya _k_ arati has the double meaning \'lives\nwith I _d_ a (the woman)\' and \'practices sacrificial rites with the i _d_\na-ceremony.\'\n\n[219:2](sbe1234.htm#fr_516) See [p. 16](sbe1204.htm#page_16), note\n[1](sbe1204.htm#fn_106).\n\n[219:3](sbe1234.htm#fr_517) The technical expression used for this fivefold\ncutting of the i _d_ a is sam-ava-do, \'to cut off completely (or together),\'\nor, according to the St. Petersb. Dict., \'to divide and collect the p. 220\npieces.\' The five cuttings of the i _d_ a consist of the upastara _n_ a, or\nunderlayer of butter in the i _d_ apatri; of two cuttings of each of the havis\n(or dishes of sacrificial food) from their southern and central parts\nrespectively; and of two drippings (or bastings, abhighara _n_ a) of butter,\nas in the case of the svish _t_ ak _ri_ t (see Katy. III, 4, 6, and note on I,\n7, 3, 20). According to some authorities, the i _d_ a consists of four\ncuttings only (cf. Hillebrandt, Neu- and Vollm. p. 122).\n\n[220:1](sbe1234.htm#fr_518) According to Katy. III, 4, 8, 9, he does so\nwithout quitting his hold of the i _d_ a; and he withdraws the latter from the\nHot _ri_ ; when he anoints him.\n\n[220:2](sbe1234.htm#fr_520) A gesture here indicates the two middle joints\n(or, according to Harisvamin, the intermediate links) of the Hot _ri_ \'s right\nfore-finger, viz. first the lower joint, and afterwards (par. 15) the upper\njoint; whereupon the Hot _ri_ applies the respective joints to his lips and\nsmears the butter on them, cf. \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_. I, 7, 1; Katy. III, 4, 9;\nHillebrandt, op. cit., p. 124. In _S_ at. Br. XII, 2, 4, 5 the fore-finger is\ncalled annaditama, or the finger \'which eats most food;\' cf. Weber, Prati _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ asutra, p. 97.\n\n[221:1](sbe1234.htm#fr_521) Enam hotari _s_ rayati, literally \'he makes it\nenter into, remain in, the Hot _ri_.\' The author, however, here, as in I, 6,\n4, 7, mixes up the verb _s_ ri with _s_ ra, \'to cook.\' The reason for this see\n[p. 177](sbe1229.htm#page_177), note [4](sbe1229.htm#fn_408).\n\n[221:2](sbe1234.htm#fr_522) This, according to \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_ r. I, 7, 3, and\ncomm., is effected in the following way: the Hot _ri_ takes the i _d_ a with\nhis joined hands (a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ali) and makes it lie in his left hand; whereupon\nthe Adhvaryu cuts the (fivefold cut) avantare _d_ a from the i _d_ a into the\nHot _ri_ \'s right hand, the fingers of which point northwards; the five\ncuttings apparently consist of the \'underlayer\' of butter, two pieces cut from\nthe i _d_ a, and drippings of butter on them. Cf. Hillebrandt, op. cit., p.\n125.\n\n[221:3](sbe1234.htm#fr_523) During the invocation of the i _d_ a the Hot _ri_\nholds the butter (as well as the avantare _d_ a), and the other priests\n(except the Brahman) and the sacrificer touch the i _d_ a (or, according to\nKarka, the Hot _ri_ ). Katy. III, 4, 11, 12.\n\n[222:1](sbe1234.htm#fr_524) There are considerable differences between the\ntext of, the Hot _ri_ \'s call to the i _d_ a as here given and that given in \xc3\x82\n_s_ v. _S_. I, 7, 7. The text of the Black Ya _g_ ur-veda (Taitt. Br. III, 5,\n8; Taitt. S. II, 6, 7; I, 7, 1), on the other hand, only differs from ours in\none or two points. According to \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_. I, 5, 28, the calls are to be\nuttered in the highest pitch (cf. Hillebrandt, Neu- and Vollmondsopfer, p.\n126, note).\n\n[222:2](sbe1234.htm#fr_525) Viz. the Hot _ri_ , as the representative of the\nofficiating priests. Schol.\n\n[222:3](sbe1234.htm#fr_526) On the rathantara and b _ri_ hat samans, see [p.\n196](sbe1231.htm#page_196), note [2](sbe1231.htm#fn_446). The vamadevya saman\nis Sama-veda II, 32-34: kaya na _s_ _k_ itra a bhuvad uti sadav _ri_ dha _h_\nsakha, \'with what favour will he assist us, the wonderful, ever-gladdening,\nfriend,\' &c. Cf. Haug, Ait. Br. II, 246.\n\n[222:4](sbe1234.htm#fr_527) For upahuta gava _h_ , the Taitt. reads upahuta\ndhenu _h_ , \'called hither is the cow.\' \xc3\x82 _s_ val. _S_ r. has upahuta gava _h_\nsaha _s_ ira _h_ \\--upahuta dhenu _h_ saha _ri_ shabha. Here and after the\nsucceeding calls we have apparently to supply the inverse formulas, \'May p.\n223 the cows together with the bull call us,\' &c., as in Taitt. Br., they\nbeing likewise omitted in Taitt. S. II, 6, 7.\n\n[223:1](sbe1234.htm#fr_528) The seven Hot _ri_ s comprise the Hot _ri_ with\nhis assistants, the Maitravaru _n_ a (or Pra _s_ astri), and A _k_ _kh_ avaka;\nand the chief assistants of the Brahman, viz. the Brahma _n_ a _k_ _kh_ a _m_\nsin, \xc3\x82gnidhra, Pot _ri_ , and Nesh _t_ _ri_. The Gravastut, another assistant\nof the Hot _ri_ , is often added as eighth Hot _ri_. Cf. Haug, Ait. Br. II, p.\n147. Instead of upahuta saptahotra in our text, the Ka _n_ va text and the\nBlack Ya _g_ ur-veda read upahuta _h_ saptahotra _h_ , \'called hither are the\nseven Hot _ri_ ships;\' \xc3\x82 _s_ val. _S_ r. upahuta divya sapta hotara _h_ ,\n\'called hither are the seven divine Hot _ri_ s.\'\n\n[223:2](sbe1234.htm#fr_529) Bhaksha, \'the eating, enjoying;\' perhaps the\nauthor here takes it in the sense of \'feeder,\' in that of \'eater, quaffer;\'\nSaya _n_ a, on Taitt. S. II, 6, 7, 3, takes it as Soma-drink (somapitha).\n\n[223:3](sbe1234.htm#fr_530) Apparently, like hikka (verb hikk), imitative of\nthe internal sound of the hiccough. The Ka _n_ va MS. has harik instead; and\nthe Black Ya _g_ us ho, which it identifies with the self (atman).\n\n[224:1](sbe1234.htm#fr_531) After \'May I _d_ a also call us to her,\' he\nrepeats \'I _d_ a is called hither! Called hither (thither) is Ida!\'\n\n[224:2](sbe1234.htm#fr_532) See I, 8, 1, 7-8, with note 3.\n\n[224:3](sbe1234.htm#fr_533) Brahma devak _ri_ topahuta; the Black Ya _g_ ur-\nveda and \xc3\x82 _s_ val. _S_ r. read \'brahma devak _ri_ tam upahutam.\' Cf. Taitt.\nS. I, 7, 1, 5, brahma vai devanam b _ri_ haspati _h_.\n\n[225:1](sbe1234.htm#fr_534) ? The commentator remarks: \'He says, The divine\nAdhvaryus assuredly are the calves,\' because, in his opinion, the sannayya\nconstitutes the sacrificial food which contains the Adhvaryus (havis--\nadhvaryuvat). In I, 1, 2, 17 we met with the A _s_ vins as the two divine\nAdhvaryus.\n\n[226:1](sbe1234.htm#fr_535) With this and the following paragraphs cf. I, 9,\n1, 12 seq.\n\n[227:1](sbe1234.htm#fr_536) See Saya _n_ a\'s comm. on Taitt. S. II, 6, 7, 6.\n\n[227:2](sbe1234.htm#fr_537) Before this formula the Black Ya _g_ ur-veda\ninserts, \'Called (he is) to the heavenly abode!\' and after it as the final\nformula, \'All that is dear to him (the sacrificer) is called! Called (he is)\nof (? by) everything dear that is called!\' Taitt, Br. III, 5, 9, 3. For the\nmodifications of the concluding mantras in the case of the i _d_ a being\ninvoked for the mistress of the house ( _S_ at. Br. I, 9, 2, 5), see Taitt.\nBr, III, 5, 13.\n\n[228:1](sbe1234.htm#fr_538) Viz. \'I _d_ a is called hither!\' see par. 24.\nAccording to Katy. III, 4, 12, all (the other priests and the sacrificer,\nprobably with the exception of the Brahman) touch the i _d_ a (or, according\nto Karka, they touch the Hot _ri_ who holds the i _d_ a) whilst the invocation\nof the i _d_ a takes place. The quartering of the cake, according to ib. 13,\nis done with the text, \'Make swell, O ruddy one! milk me life; milk me\noffspring; milk me cattle; milk me brahmahood; milk me kshatriyahood; milk me\npeople! Fatten through the progeny, through the cattle of him who hates us,\nwhom we hate!\'\n\n[228:2](sbe1234.htm#fr_539) According to Katy. III, 4, 14, the Adhvaryu puts\nthe four parts on the barhis and assigns one to each priest. But according to\nthe commentary and to other Sutras, it is the sacrificer who allocates the\nportions by laying them down so as to correspond with the four intermediate\nregions, commencing in the south-east (or Agni\'s) region, and saying, \'This\nfor the Brahman,\' \'This for the Hot _ri_ ,\' \'This for the Adhvaryu,\' \'This for\nthe Agnidh.\' The sacrificer then shifts his Brahmanical cord from the right to\nthe left shoulder, and while touching the four portions, and looking towards\nthe south (the region of the fathers), murmurs (Va _g_. S. II, 31), \'Here, O\nfathers, regale yourselves! Like bulls come hither (av _ri_ shayadhvam) each\nto his own share!\' He then quits his hold of the portions, and murmurs, \'The\nfathers have regaled themselves: like bulls they came each to his own share!\'\nSee _S_ at. Br. II, 4, 2, 20 seq.; Va _g_. S. p. 57. [The Ka _n_ va text of\nthe Brahma _n_ a does not mention the formulas here any more than does our\nauthor.] He then shifts the cord back on his left shoulder, touches water, and\nhands the portions to the priests for them to eat. Katy. III, 4, 16-18.\n\n[229:1](sbe1234.htm#fr_540) Katy. _S_ r. III, 4, 19. There is some uncertainty\nas to the particular time when the Adhvaryu cuts the sha _d_ avatta; cf.\nHillebrandt, p. 123. Mahidhara on Va _g_. S. II, 10 remarks: When the Hot _ri_\npronounces the call to heaven and earth, then he (the Adhvaryu), having put\none piece of each of the two cakes in (the two bowls of) the Sha _d_ avatta\n(vessel), gives it to the Agnidh; and the latter eats it with the formulas\n\'Hither is called (the mother Earth),\' &c. The \'six cuttings\' of the Sha _d_\navatta consist of a piece of the Agni cake with an \'underlayer\' and a dripping\nof butter for each of the two bowls of the Sha _d_ avatta dish.\n\n[229:2](sbe1234.htm#fr_541) That is, the formula \'Hither is called the\nsacrificer,\' see par. 29.\n\n[229:3](sbe1234.htm#fr_542) The priests eat first their quarter of the cake\nand then, with the sacrificer, their share of the i _d_ a. The Hot _ri_ eats\nalso the avantare _d_ a, with the text (\xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_. I, 7, 8), \'O I _d_ a,\naccept graciously our share!\' &c.\n\n[230:1](sbe1234.htm#fr_543) See I, 3, 2, 5 seq. The Ka _n_ va text omits this\nparagraph.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 8, 2. Second Brahma _n_ a](sbe1235.htm)\n\n'
