Thereby the Yoga (Sm _ri_ ti) is refuted.\n\nThis Sutra extends the application of the preceding argumentation, and remarks\nthat by the refutation of the Sa _n_ khya-sm _ri_ ti the Yoga-sm _ri_ ti also\nis to be considered as refuted; for the latter also assumes, in opposition to\nScripture, a pradhana as the independent cause of the world, and the 'great\nprinciple,' &c. as its effects, although neither the Veda nor common\nexperience favour these views.--But, if the same reasoning applies to the Yoga\nalso, the latter system is already disposed of by the previous arguments; of\nwhat use then is it formally to extend them to the Yoga? (as the Sutra\ndoes.)--We reply that here an additional\n\np. 297\n\ncause of doubt presents itself, the practice of Yoga being enjoined in the\nVeda as a means of obtaining perfect knowledge; so, for instance, B _ri_. Up.\nII, 4, 5, '(The Self) is to be heard, to be thought, to be meditated upon 1.'\nIn the _S_ veta _s_ vatara Upanishad, moreover, we find various injunctions of\nYoga-practice connected with the assumption of different positions of the\nbody; &c.; so, for instance, 'Holding his body with its three erect parts\neven,' &c. (II, 8).\n\nFurther, we find very many passages in the Veda which (without expressly\nenjoining it) point to the Yoga, as, for instance, Ka. Up. II, 6, 11, 'This,\nthe firm holding back of the senses, is what is called Yoga;' 'Having received\nthis knowledge and the whole rule of Yoga' (Ka. Up. II, 6, 18); and so on. And\nin the Yoga- _s_ astra itself the passage, 'Now then Yoga, the means of the\nknowledge of truth,' &c. defines the Yoga as a means of reaching perfect\nknowledge. As thus one topic of the _s_ astra at least (viz. the practice of\nYoga) is shown to be authoritative, the entire Yoga-sm _ri_ ti will have to be\naccepted as unobjectionable, just as the Sm _ri_ ti referring to the ash _t_\nakas 2.--To this we reply that the formal extension (to the Yoga, of the\narguments primarily directed against the Sa _n_ khya) has the purpose of\nremoving the additional doubt stated in the above lines; for in spite of a\npart of the Yoga-sm _ri_ ti being authoritative, the disagreement (between Sm\n_ri_ ti and _S_ ruti) on other topics remains as shown above.--Although 3\nthere are many Sm _ri_ tis treating of the soul, we have singled out for\nrefutation the Sa _n_ khya and Yoga because they are widely known as offering\nthe means for accomplishing the highest\n\np. 298\n\nend of man and have found favour with many competent persons. Moreover, their\nposition is strengthened by a Vedic passage referring to them, 'He who has\nknown that cause which is to be apprehended by Sa _n_ khya and Yoga he is\nfreed from all fetters' ( _S_ ve. Up. VI, 13). (The claims which on the ground\nof this last passage might be set up for the Sa _n_ khya and Yoga-sm _ri_ tis\nin their entirety) we refute by the remark that the highest beatitude (the\nhighest aim of man) is not to be attained by the knowledge of the Sa _n_ khya-\nsm _ri_ ti irrespective of the Veda, nor by the road of Yoga-practice. For\nScripture itself declares that there is no other means of obtaining the\nhighest beatitude but the knowledge of the unity of the Self which is conveyed\nby the Veda, 'Over death passes only the man who knows him; there is no other\npath to go' ( _S_ ve. Up. Ill, 8). And the Sa _n_ khya and Yoga-systems\nmaintain duality, do not discern the unity of the Self. In the passage quoted\n('That cause which is to be apprehended by Sa _n_ khya and Yoga') the terms\n'Sa _n_ khya' and 'Yoga' denote Vedic knowledge and meditation, as we infer\nfrom proximity 1. We willingly allow room for those portions of the two\nsystems which do not contradict the Veda. In their description of the soul,\nfor instance, as free from all qualities the Sa _n_ khyas are in harmony with\nthe Veda which teaches that the person (purusha) is essentially pure; cp. B\n_ri_. Up. IV, 3, 16. 'For that person is not attached to anything.' The Yoga\nagain in giving rules for the condition of the wandering religious mendicant\nadmits that state of retirement from the concerns of life which is known from\nscriptural passages such as the following one, 'Then the parivra _g_ aka with\ndiscoloured (yellow) dress, shaven, without any possessions,' &c. ( _G_ abala\nUpan. IV).\n\nThe above remarks will serve as a reply to the claims of all argumentative Sm\n_ri_ tis. If it be said that those Sm _ri_ tis also assist, by argumentation\nand proof, the cognition of truth, we do not object to so much, but we\nmaintain\n\np. 299\n\nall the same that the truth can be known from the Vedanta-texts only; as is\nstated by scriptural passages such as 'None who does not know the Veda\nperceives that great one' (Taitt. Br. III, 12, 9, 7); 'I now ask thee that\nperson taught in the Upanishads' (B _ri_. Up, III, 9, 26); and others.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[297:1](sbe34142.htm#fr_264) In which passage the phrase 'to be meditated\nupon' (nididhyasa) indicates the act of mental concentration characteristic of\nthe Yoga.\n\n[297:2](sbe34142.htm#fr_265) The ash _t_ akas (certain oblations to be made on\nthe eighth days after the full moons of the seasons hemanta and _s_ i _s_ ira)\nfurnish the stock illustration for the doctrine of the Purva Mim. that Sm _ri_\nti is authoritative in so far as it is based on _S_ ruti.\n\n[297:3](sbe34142.htm#fr_266) But why--it will be asked--do you apply yourself\nto the refutation of the Sa _n_ khya and Yoga only, and not also to that of\nother Sm _ri_ tis conflicting with the Vedanta views?\n\n[298:1](sbe34142.htm#fr_267) I. e. from the fact of these terms being employed\nin a passage standing close to other passages which refer to Vedic knowledge.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1, 4](sbe34143.htm)\n\n"
