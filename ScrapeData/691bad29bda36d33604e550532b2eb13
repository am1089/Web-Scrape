And on account of (Brahman) as described being declared to be the cause\nwith regard to Ether, and so on.\n\nHere the philosopher who holds the Pradhana to be the general cause comes\nforward with another objection. The Vedanta-texts, he says, do not teach that\ncreation proceeds from one and the same agent only, and you therefore have no\nright to hold that Brahman is the sole cause of the world. In one place it is\nsaid that our world proceeded from \'Being\', \'Being only this was in the\nbeginning\' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 2, 1). In other places the world is said to have\nsprung from \'Non-being\', \'Non-being indeed this was in the beginning\' (Taitt.\nUp. II, 7, i); and \'Non-being only was this in the beginning; it became Being\'\n( _Kh_. Up. III, 19, 1). As the Vedanta-texts are thus not consequent in their\nstatements regarding the creator, we cannot conclude from them that Brahman is\nthe sole cause of the world. On the other hand, those texts do enable us to\nconclude that the Pradhana only is the universal cause. For the text \'Now all\nthis was then undeveloped\' (B _ri_. Up. I, 4, 7) teaches that the world was\nmerged in the undeveloped Pradhana. and the subsequent\n\np. 375\n\nclause, \'That developed itself by form and name,\' that from that Undeveloped\nthere resulted the creation of the world. For the Undeveloped is that which is\nnot distinguished by names and forms, and this is none other than the\nPradhana. And as this Pradhana is at the same time eternal, as far as its\nessential nature is concerned, and the substrate of all change, there is\nnothing contradictory in the different accounts of creation calling it\nsometimes \'Being\' and sometimes \'Non-being\'; while, on the other hand, these\nterms cannot, without contradiction, both be applied to Brahman. The causality\nof the Undeveloped having thus been ascertained, such expressions as \'it\n_thought_ , may I be many,\' must be interpreted as meaning its being about to\nproceed to creation. The terms \'Self and \'Brahman\' also may be applied to the\nPradhana in so far as it is all-pervading(atman from apnoti), and preeminently\ngreat (b _ri_ hat). We therefore conclude that the only cause of the world\nabout which the Vedanta-texts give information is the Pradhana.\n\nThis view is set aside by the Sutra. The word _and_ is used in the sense of\n_but_. It is possible to ascertain from the Vedanta-texts that the world\nsprings from none other than the highest Brahman, which is all-knowing, lord\nof all, free from all shadow of imperfection, capable of absolutely realising\nits purposes, and so on; since scripture declares Brahman as described to be\nthe cause of Ether, and so on. By \'Brahman as described\' is meant \'Brahman\ndistinguished by omniscience and other qualities, as described in the Sutra\n"that from which the origination, and so on, of the world proceed," and in\nother places.\' That Brahman only is declared by scripture to be the cause of\nEther, and so on, i.e. the being which is declared to be the cause in passages\nsuch as \'From that Self sprang Ether\' (Taitt. Up. II, 1); \'that sent forth\nfire\'( _Kh_. Up. VI, 2, 3), is none other than Brahman possessing omniscience\nand similar qualities. For the former of these texts follows on the passage\n\'The True, intelligence, infinite is Brahman; he reaches all desires together\nwith the intelligent Brahman,\' which introduces Brahman as the general\nsubject-matter--that\n\np. 376\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahman being then referred to by means of the\nconnecting words \'from that.\' In the same way the \'that\' (in \'that sent forth\nfire\') refers back to the omniscient Brahman introduced in the clause \'that\nthought, may I be many.\' This view is confirmed by a consideration of all the\naccounts of creation, and we hence conclude that Brahman is the sole cause of\nthe world.--But the text \'Non-being indeed this was in the beginning\' calls\nthe general cause \'something that is not\'; how then can you say that we infer\nfrom the Vedanta-texts as the general cause of the world a Brahman that is\nall-knowing, absolutely realises its purposes, and so on?--To this question\nthe next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 15.
