This chapter proceeds to establish the Vedic\ndoctrine that Atman is the First Cause of the universe, by way of refuting the\ntheories which maintain that the material cause of the universe is something\nelse really existent, and independent of Atman.\n\n#### Vaiseshika\'s Atomic theory.\n\n1\\. The _paramanus_ , the extremely small atoms, combined together, constitute\nthe upadana or material cause of the universe. Hence it is that a pot\nmanifests itself in constant association with clay, but not with Isvara.\n\nIt is the indivisible extremely subtle things called _paramanus_ which,\ncombining together in various ways, give rise to the universe comprising all\ncreated objects with their attributes and activities. We speak of a substance\nas the upadana or material cause of other things when it is found invariably\nassociated with them, and upon whose existence the existence of those other\nthings depends. Nothing in\n\np. 19\n\nour experience is thus invariably found associated with Atman, the Self, or\nIsvara. On the other hand, every created object is found invariably associated\nwith something other than Atman, with something or other which is insentient.\nA pot, for instance, is invariably associated with clay. Hence the conclusion\nthat the insentient atoms, not the sentient Isvara nor His Maya, are the\nmaterial cause of the universe.\n\n2\\. It is the qualities, such as colour, taste, etc., inherent in the atoms\nthemselves, which produce qualities of a kindred sort in the effect\nseparately.\n\nThus, the atoms and their qualities give rise to all objects in creation as\nwell as their qualities, so that Isvara is not the material cause either of\nthe substances or of their qualities.\n\n#### Vaiseshika\'s threefold cause.\n\n3\\. That with which the effect is intimately associated is the _samav ayi-\nkarana_, the inseparable or material cause, as.\n\np. 20\n\nopposed to the accessories such as the potter\'s wheel, which belong to a\ncategory different from the _samav ayi-karana_.\n\n4\\. That is said to be the _asamavayi-karana_ , the accidental or separable\ncause, which, while quite necessary to produce the effect, resides in the\nsamavayi, or in the substratum of the samavayi.\n\n5\\. An efficient ( _nimitta_ ) cause of all effects is Isvara, like the\npotter.\n\nThe Vaiseshika says that there are three kinds of causes for every positive\neffect, known respectively as the _samavayi_ or _upadana-karana_ , the\nmaterial cause; the _asamavayi-karana_ , the accidental cause; the _nimitta-\nkarana_ , the efficient or intelligent cause. _Thread_ is the material cause\nof a cloth, because the latter is in constant relation with the other.\nAccording to the definition of the _asamavayi-karana_ given in the verse 4,\n_the combining of threads with one another_ constitutes the asamavayi-karana\nof the cloth, because the\n\np. 21\n\nact of combining resides in the threads which form the samavayi-karana of the\ncloth. Again, according to the definition, the _colour_ of the thread is the\nasamavayi-karana of the colour of the cloth, because the former which gives\nrise to the latter resides in the thread which forms the substratum (the\nsamavayin) of the cloth, and the cloth again is the substance wherein the\ncolour of the cloth inheres in constant relation and is therefore called the\nsamavayi of that colour. The remaining factors in the causal aggregate\ncomprise (1) what is called the _nimitta-karana_ , the efficient cause like\nthe weaver, and (2) the _sahakari_ or auxiliary cause such as the instruments\nused by him in producing the cloth out of the thread. Isvara is said to be a\nmere efficient cause in all effects. And as the efficient cause He is a\nnecessary factor in the creation of the universe; for, we see that without an\nimpulse from a sentient being no effect is ever produced out of a material.\nWithout a potter, for instance, no pot is ever produced out of clay. Isvara\nbeing thus only one of the factors in the creation of the universe, to hold\nthat the sole cause of the universe is the sentient Brahman is opposed to all\nour experience.\n\np. 22\n\n5-6\\. Whencesoever an effect is born, there it abides; a pot abides in clay, a\ncloth in thread, a finger-ring in gold. Thus say the Vaiseshikas as well as\nthe Naiyayikas.\n\n#### The Sankhya Theory.\n\n7-8\\. Rajas, Sattva and Tamas,--these are the three qualities of Pradhana.\nRajas is impassioned and mobile; Sattva, pure and luminous; Tamas, dark and\nconcealing: they are the causes of creation, preservation and destruction.\n\nPradhana, otherwise called Prakriti, is said to be composed of three distinct\nelements called _Gunas_ perceived as intimately associated, or even identical,\nwith one\'s own self by those who cannot discriminate between matter and\nspirit. Rajas, _literally_ the colouring element, is characterised by passion\nand motion and forms the support by which the other two are held in their\nplace. Sattva, _lit_. goodness, is very subtle acid light, and is the\n\np. 23\n\nelement by which we become conscious of the external world. Tamas, lit.\ndarkness, is heavy, dull and impure, concealing the reality from our vision.\nThe respective functions of these three distinct constituents of Pradhana\nmanifest themselves in the creation, preservation and destruction of the\nuniverse. How they cause these will be explained later on. This school of\nSankhya holds that no Intelligent Being is necessary even as the efficient\ncause of the universe.\n\nNow follows the refutation of these.\n\nThe second stanza of the Hymn is intended to refute the theories as to the\ncause of the universe advanced by the Vaiseshikas, Naiyayikas, Sankhyas,\nSvabhava-vadins, Nihilists (Sunyavadins), Saivas and Pauranikas.\n\nThe meaning of the second stanza may be explained as follows:\n\n#### Refutation of the Atomic Theory.\n\n9\\. In the series of effects from the sprout. of the plant up to its fruit,\n_existence_ is admitted. Whence do, then, come those atoms and conjoin into\nfig-seeds?\n\nThat is to say, the doctrine that the atoms are the cause of the universe is\ncontradicted by\n\np. 24\n\nexperience. For, the upadana or material cause of the universe is defined to\nbe that which is perceived in association with all objects of creation. It\nbeing only _existence_ , not _atoms_ , that we cognize in all objects of\ncreation, the upadana of the universe must be Brahman spoken of as the _Sat_\nor existent, not the atoms or anything else. How, for instance, can atoms be\nsaid to be the upadana of the fig-seed, the final effect? Though atoms be the\nupadana of the _dvyanukas_ , molecules of two atoms, yet they are not\nperceived to be as such in all products. Three dvyanukas are said to form a\n_tryanuka_ , the next compound; a hypothesis not warranted by experience. If\nsuch were the case, we would perceive along with the pot the lump of clay out\nof which it was produced, and the pot along with pot-sherds. This cannot be,\ninasmuch as no after-state is perceived without the previous state entirely\nvanishing, and that what has vanished out of sight cannot be said to be the\nupadana. If this last were possible, then atoms themselves might be the\nupadana of the final products, which is contrary. to the hypothesis of the\nVaiseshikas. Atoms are, moreover, assumed to be supersensuous; so that the\neffects which are made of supersensuous atoms must also be supersensuous.\nWherefore, Brahman alone, the Existence, as present in all objects of\ncreation, is the upadana of the universe.\n\np. 25\n\nThe upadana-karana is sometimes defined--as the word upadana literally means,\n--to be the substance which one must primarily lay hold of in producing an\neffect. On the strength of this definition, the Vaiseshika might argue, in\ndefence of his theory, that it is the seed, not Brahman\'s existence, which one\nmust primarily lay hold of in order to produce the tree, and that therefore\nBrahman cannot be the material cause of all effects. In reply, the Brahmavadin\nsays that the objection applies to both alike. The Vaiseshika must admit that\nhe who wishes to produce a tree resorts primarily not to atoms, but to the\nseed. If he should try to explain this difficulty by saying that the seed\nwhich is resorted to is originally built out of atoms, the Brahmavadin defends\nhis theory by saying that the seed itself is a _vivarta_ or an illusory aspect\nof Brahman. The Brahmavadin\'s position is further strengthened by the fact\nthat in the seed _existence_ is cognised, but not the _atoms_.\n\n10\\. It is admitted by all that the effect is accompanied with the cause\n(upadana). Hence it is that _existence_ and _light_ are present in every\nobject.\n\nEvery object of creation appears in the light of\n\np. 26\n\nconsciousness as something existent. Wherefore the self-luminous Existence is\nthe material cause.\n\n11\\. When the flower becomes the fruit, when milk becomes curd, properties--\nsuch as form, taste and the like--of a distinct class from those of the cause\nare cognised.\n\nWhereas, according to the Vaiseshika theory, the qualities of the effect\nshould be of the same kind as those of the cause, the former being caused by\nthe latter. Thus though one effect follows another, the preceding effect\ncannot be said to be the material cause of the succeeding one as the\nVaiseshika maintains.\n\n#### The Theory of Illusion.\n\nIt may be asked, how can the mere self-luminous Existence which is formless\ngive rise to the universe of forms? We reply: It is said to be the Cause\nmerely because It underlies all manifested illusory forms, like the rope which\nis the basis of the illusory form of the serpent, etc. Accordingly the\nVartikakara says:\n\np. 27\n\n12\\. Cause and effect, part and whole, genus and individual, substance and\nattribute, action and agent, and others like these are imaginary forms of the\nOne Light.\n\nIt being impossible--either according to the _Arambhavada_ , the Vaiseshika\ntheory of creation, or according to the _Parinamavada_ , the Sankhya theory of\ntransformation,--to explain that one thing can really cause another, and all\nother theories being altogether unfounded, we have to conclude that the\nuniverse is a mere display of Maya on the background of self-conscious\nBrahman.\n\n#### Intelligence and activity inhere only in the Sentient.\n\n13\\. Neither for the atoms nor for the Pradhana is sentiency claimed in\ncreating the Universe. Intelligence and activity are found to inhere in a\nsentient being.\n\nThe Vaiseshikas and Sankhyas do not claim sentiency for the atoms and the\nPradhana, which they respectively hold to be the cause of the universe. Sruti\n( _Vide_ Chhandogya-upanishad, 6-2)\n\np. 28\n\ndeclares that creation proceeds from a self-conscious Being, Himself becoming\nthe universe in its manifold aspects. Consciousness and activity are never\nfound in insentient matter unassociated with a self-conscious entity. From\nthis it necessarily follows that creation proceeds from a self-conscious\nPrinciple who can think and act. Thus, according to the Sruti, the universe\ncannot be said to actually proceed from the insentient atoms or the insentient\nPradhana as such, or even from either of these acted on by the will of a self-\nconscious Being, of an extra-cosmic God, existing quite apart from the matter\nout of which the universe is built. On the other hand, the Sruti teaches that\nthe universe proceeds from Isvara by an act of will, that He is both the\nefficient and the material cause of the universe. Though He is immutable in\nHimself, not subject to any change, not affected by anything whatsoever, still\nit may be supposed that He thinks and acts, is conscious of an external world\nand acts upon it, when viewed in association with His Maya-Sakti, the power of\nillusion containing within it the potentialities of the universe as made up of\ncauses and effects.\n\n14\\. By His Kriya-Sakti or energy of activity assuming the form of Time, milk\n\np. 29\n\nis transformed into curd. By His Jnana-Sakti or energy of intelligence, the\nuniverse comes into being as made up of the [perceiver](errata.htm#12) and the\nobjects of perception.\n\nThe Sankhya holds that an effect comes into being independently of a sentient\nbeing, and adduces, in evidence of his theory, the fact of milk transforming\nitself into curd without the intervention of a sentient being. As against\nthis, the Vedantin holds that it is the Isvara dwelling, as the Sruti (Bri-Up.\n5-7-15) declares, in all objects of creation controlling and guiding them from\nwithin, who, by His Kriya-Sakti, assuming the form of Time acts upon milk so\nas to transform it into curd. Milk by itself cannot become curd. If it could,\nthen it would ever be changing into curd. Again, there is a state of Maya in\nwhich it is associated with a semblance of Brahman\'s consciousness and forms\nthe consciousness of Isvara, the author of the universe, who, at the beginning\nof creation, is said to have had before his view all that was to be created,\nand from whom proceeds our consciousness of the universe. This consciousness\nof Isvara is what is called Jnana-Sakti, the energy of intelligence. Itself\nthus assuming the form of intelligence, Maya converts its basis, Brahman\nassociated with Maya, into a conscious entity, while, it also presents itself\nto His view as\n\np. 30\n\nthe universe to be created, as the object of perception. Thus by Jnana-Sakti\nof Isvara the universe comes into being.\n\n15\\. Consciousness is of two kinds: Nirvikalpaka or the undifferentiated\nconsciousness illumines the Thing itself, while Savikalpa or the\ndifferentiated consciousness is manifold as illumining the designations, etc.\n\nThe Jnana-Sakti takes two forms. First, there is the consciousness which at\nthe beginning of creation expressed itself in the form "may I become many,"\nand relates to the external universe as a whole in general. It is known as\n_nirvikalpaka_ or the undifferentiated consciousness. Again, the same\nconsciousness, when relating to the objects of external universe in their\nrespective special characteristics, such as the several elements of matter and\nmaterial objects, becomes what is called _savikalpa_ or differentiated\nconsciousness.\n\nThus though consciousness is one and homogeneous in itself, it appears to be\ndifferent in the different forms illumined by it. As, for instance:\n\np. 31\n\n16\\. Imagination, doubt, confusion, memory, consciousness of similarity,\ndetermination, guess, and non-apprehension; and so also other states of\nconsciousness.\n\nThese other states of consciousness comprise those which are generally\nregarded as _pramas_ ,--forms of right knowledge as relating to the real state\nof things. They are differently enumerated in the different systems of\nphilosophy, as follows:\n\n17\\. The Charvakas hold to _pratyaksha_ (sensuous perception) alone, whereas\nKanada and Sugata recognise that as well as _anum ana_ (inference). Sankhyas\nrecognise the two as well as _Sabda_ (verbal statement);\n\n18\\. And so do some of the Naiyayikas so called, while other (Naiyayikas) add\n_upamana_ (comparison). Prabhakara\n\np. 32\n\nmentions these four along with _arth apatti_ (presumption).\n\n19\\. The Vedantins and the followers of Bhatta recognise a sixth one named\n_Abh ava;_ while the Pauranikas mention these with the addition of _Sambhava_\n(consistency) and _Aitihya_ (tradition).\n\nCharvakas: otherwise known as the _Lokayatas_ , those who hold that nothing is\nreal except what is revealed by the senses. _Kanada:_ the founder of the\nVaiseshika system of philosophy. _Sugata:_ Buddha, who preached that Atman was\nnothing independent of the states of consciousness which change from moment to\nmoment. _Sankhyas:_ the followers of Kapila\'s and Patanjali\'s systems of\nphilosophy. The followers of _Gautama\'s_ system of Nyaya recognise upamana as\nan independent source of right knowledge. _Prabhakara_ and _Bhatta_ were\nleaders of two different schools of Jaimini\'s system of Karma-Mimamsa;\n_Vedantins:_ those who follow the lead of _Badarayana_ , the founder of the\nsystem called Sariraka-mimamsa, which treats of the nature of Brahman.\n_Pauranikas:_ those who base their system of philosophy on the teaching of the\nPuranas.\n\np. 33\n\n_Pratyaksha:_ sensuous perception; right knowledge obtained by sense-organs\ncoming in contact with external objects, like our knowledge of colour, etc.,\nobtained through the eye, etc.\n\n_Anumana:_ right knowledge obtained by a process of inference. First, by\nobservation we find that wherever there is smoke there is fire. Then, when in\na certain place we see smoke, we infer that fire exists in that place. The\nknowledge of the existence of fire has here been obtained by a process of\ninference.\n\n_Sabda:_ right knowledge obtained through a verbal statement proceeding from a\ntrustworthy source.\n\n_Upamana:_ right knowledge of similarity obtained by a process of comparison.\nTo explain: A man learns for the first time from a forester that a gayal (a\nwild animal) is like a cow. Afterwards, on seeing an animal like a cow in a\nforest, the perception of similarity reminds him of the forester\' directions,\nand he concludes that it is [a](errata.htm#13) gayal.\n\n_Arthapatti:_ right knowledge in the form of presumption: surmising a thing to\naccount for something else known. Thus, in the case of a fat man who does not\neat by day, his fatness cannot be explained except through the surmisal of his\neating at night. By presumption, we come to know that he eats at night.\n\n_Abhava:_ an immediate consciousness of the non-existence of something by the\nnon-perception\n\np. 34\n\nthereof where, if it existed, it ought to have been perceived. When, for\ninstance, in a lighted room we do not perceive a jar, we become immediately\nconscious that the jar does not exist there.\n\n_Sambhava:_ the right knowledge we have as to the existence of a part when we\nknow that the whole of which it is the part exists. If we know that a man has\none hundred rupees, it is a right knowledge to know that he has ten rupees.\n\n_Aitihya:_ right knowledge obtained by tradition, which is transmitted from\ngeneration to generation, and of which the source is unknown; such is the\nknowledge concerning a Yaksha (an invisible being) said to occupy a tree.\n\nThese terms, _pratyaksha_ , etc., are applied to _prama_ or the right\nknowledge thus obtained, as well as to _pramana_ , the _karana_ or the means\nby which such a knowledge is obtained. While the Charvakas dogmatically\ndiscard as unreliable all sources of information other than sensuous\nperception, others reduce some of the eight sources of knowledge mentioned\nabove, to one or another of those which they recognize as independent sources\nof knowledge.\n\n#### The Vaiseshika\'s Categories.\n\np. 35\n\n20\\. The followers of Kanada mention six padarthas or categories of existence;\n_viz_.:\n\nI. _Dravya_ , substance. II. _Guna_ , quality. III. _Karma_ , motion or\nactivity. IV. _Samanya_ , genus. V. _Visesha_ , difference. VI. _Samavaya_ ,\nintimate relation or co-inherence.\n\n21-23\\. I. Substances are nine:\n\n_Bhutas_ or elements (1. earth, 2. water, 3. light, 4. air and 5. ether.) 6.\n_Dis_ , space. 7. _Kala_ , time. 8. _Atman_ , soul. 9. _Manas_ , mind.\n\nII. Qualities are twenty-four:\n\n1\\. _Sabda_ , sound. 2. _Sparsa_ , tangibility. 3. _Rupa_ , colour. 4. _Rasa_\n, taste. 5. _Gandha_ , odour. 6. _Parimana_ , dimension. 7. _Sankhya_ ,\nnumber. 8. _Samyoga_ , conjunction. 9. _Vibhaga_ , disjunction. 10.\n_Prithaktva_ , mutual separateness. 11. _Gurutva_ , weight. 12. _Dravatva_ ,\nfluidity. 13. _Paratva_ , priority. 14. _Aparatva_ , posteriority. 15. _Sneha_\n,\n\np. 36\n\nviscidity. 16. _Samskara_ , tendency. 17. _Dhi_ , understanding. 18. _Dvesha_\n, aversion. 19. _Sukha_ , pleasure. 20. _Duhkha_ , pain. 21. _Ichchha_ ,\ndesire. 22. _Dharma_ , merit. 23. _Adharma_ , demerit. 24. _Prayatna_ ,\neffort.\n\n24-25\\. Tendency is of three kinds:--(1) _Vega_ or speed, like that which\ncauses the flight of an arrow, etc. (2) _Bhavana_ , that latent impression,\ncaused by experience, which subsequently helps to call forth a memory of the\nsame under favourable circumstances. (3) _Sthitasthapakata_ or elasticity,\nthat which causes return to the former state. When the leaf of the birch or\nthe branch of a tree is first dragged and then let go, it will revert to its\nformer state.\n\np. 37\n\n26\\. III. Motion or action is of five sorts as the wise say: 1. _Utkshepa_ ,\nthrowing upwards. 2. _Avakshepa_ , throwing downwards. 3, _Gamana_ , going. 4.\n_Prasarana_ , expansion. 5. _Akunchana_ , contraction.\n\n27-28\\. IV. Genus is said to be of two kinds;--I. _Para_ or the higher,\nnamely, _satta_ , existence. 2. _Apara_ or lower, such as the genus of\nsubstance, of quality, and so on.\n\n28\\. V. _Viseshas_ or ultimate differences are those which cause the knowledge\nthat one thing is different from another; and they are infinite in number.\n\nThey are said to reside in the eternal substances, such as manas, soul, time,\nspace, ether; the paramanus of earth, water, light and air.\n\np. 38\n\n29\\. VI. _Samavaya_ is eternal relation, such as that between a pot and its\ncolour.\n\nThe pairs which are thus intimately related are, the whole and its parts,\nsubstance and its qualities, action and its agent, genus and the individual,\nviseshas and the eternal substances.\n\nTime, ether, space and soul are eternal and all-pervading.\n\n30 The four kinds of _paramanus_ are infinitesimally small and eternal.\n\nThus have been enumerated the six categories according to the _Vaiseshika_\nDoctrine.\n\n#### The Sankhya\'s Categories.\n\nNow the _Vartikakara_ proceeds to give the classification of principles\naccording to Theistic Sankhya:\n\n31\\. Maya (illusion) is designated as Pradhana (the primary germ), Avyakta\n(the unmanifested), Avidya (ignorance),\n\np. 39\n\n[paragraph continues] Ajnana (nescience), Akshara (indestructible), Avyakrita\n(undifferentiated), Prakriti (the material cause), Tamas (darkness).\n\nThese are the terms applied to _Mulaprakriti_ , the root of matter, the\nultimate material cause of the universe, in _Sruti_ , _Smriti_ and _Puranas_.\n\n32\\. From Maya, when conjoined with Brahman\'s consciousness reflected in it,\nthere come into being Mahat, Time and Purusha; from the principle of Mahat\ncomes forth Ahankara.\n\nWhen Maya becomes united with the consciousness of Isvara controlling it,\nthere come into being the three principles mentioned above: Kala, that which\ncauses disturbance in the balanced condition of the _gunas_ of Prakriti. It is\nonly Brahman\'s consciousness in a particular state as induced by conjunction\nwith Prakriti. Under the influence of Kala, Prakriti evolves into Mahat\n(intellect); and with this first evolution of Prakriti as their background,\nthe Jivas or Purushas start into being, each Purusha being independent and\neternal. They are to ensoul all the created forms. The whole samsara is in\nfact intended for their evolution and\n\np. 40\n\nbenefit. They are conscious of, and become affected by, the various changes\nthat take place in nature. From Mahat, Ahankara or Egoism is evolved. This\nAhankara is either tamasic, or rajasic or sattvic.\n\n33-34\\. From the tamasic Ahankara proceed the akasa, air, fire, water and\nearth as also sound touch, colour, taste and smell, in orderly succession,\nforming the objects of the senses and the specific qualities of the bhutas\n(elements). Their deities are Sadasiva, Isa, Rudra, Vishnu, the Four-faced\n(Brahma).\n\nSound, etc., respectively form the characteristic nature of the five elements\nsuch as akasa, all infused with Ahankara. _Deities:_ Devas or the\nIntelligences working in the five subtle elements, controlling them from\nwithin, guiding their evolution according to certain laws.\n\np. 41\n\n35-36\\. From the sattvic Ahankara proceed the antah-karana, (the inner organ)\nand the organs of sensation.\n\nThe antah-karana, (the inner organ of sensation is fourfold:\n\nManas, Buddhi, Ahankara and Chitta. Doubt, determination, pride, recollection,\n--these are their objects. Chandra, Prajapati, Rudra, Kshetrajana,--these are\nthe Devatas.\n\n37\\. Ear, skin, eye, palate, and nose are known as jnanendriyas, organs of\nsensation. Dis, Vata, Surya, Varuna, Asvins,--these are said to be their\nDevatas.\n\n38\\. From the rajasic Ahankara come forth the Karmendriyas or organs of action\nand the vital airs. The Karmendriyas are tongue, hands, feet, anus, and the\norgan of generation.\n\np. 42\n\n39\\. Their functions are speaking, taking, going, leaving, and enjoying. Their\nDevatas are Vahni, Indra, Upendra, Mrityu, and Prajapati.\n\n40\\. The (vital) airs are prana, apana, vyana, udana, and samana.\n\nThe respective seats of these vital energies are the heart, the anus, the\nwhole body, the throat, and the navel.\n\n#### The twenty-four principles of the Theistic Sankhya.\n\n40-41\\. The doctors of Sankhya-Sastra enumerate twenty-four _tattvas_\n(principles) comprising the five bhutas (elements of matter), the five vital\nairs, and the fourteen indriyas (organs of sensation and action).\n\nThe Theistic Sankhyas enumerate these only as the twenty-four principles said\nto be taught in the\n\np. 43\n\n[paragraph continues] Sankhya system. According to them, all the principles\nfrom Brahman and Maya up to the Tanmatras (the primary essential elements of\nmatter) being present in all these twenty-four principles as their causes,\nthey are not to be separately counted.\n\n#### The Twenty-four Principles of the Atheistic Sankhya.\n\nThe Atheistic School of Sankhya enumerates the twenty-four principles in the\nfollowing order of evolution: 1. Mulaprakriti; 2. Mahat; 3. Ahankara; 4-8, the\nfive Tanmatras (evolved out of Tamasic Ahankara); 9-13, the five Mahabhutas or\ngross elements of matter (evolved out of the five Tanmatras); 14-18, the five\norgans of activity (evolved out of Rajasic Ahankara); 19-24, the antah-karana\nand the five external organs of sensation (evolved out of the Sattvic\nAhankara). The first of these is the cause of all, not the effect of anything\nelse. The principles enumerated from 2 to 8 are each the effect of what\nprecedes it and the cause of what follows it. Those enumerated from 9 to 24\nare mere effects, and they. do not give rise to any distinct principles in\ntheir turn. Prangs or vital energies are not regarded as distinct principles\nin themselves, being looked upon as functions of the sense-organs taken in\ntheir totality. Purushas are infinite in number and are neither causes nor\neffects of anything else. What is called Time has\n\np. 44\n\nno existence independent of the things spoken of as having existed in the\npast, or as existing in the present, or as going to exist in the future.\n\n#### The Thirty Principles of Pauranikas.\n\n41-42\\. To these adding Mahat, Time, Pradhana, Maya, Avidya and Purusha, the\nPauranikas enumerate thirty principles.\n\n_Pradhana_ is the Mula-prakriti whose first modification is Mahat. Maya and\nAvidya are thus distinguished: Maya does not delude the Being in whom it\nabides, and is entirely under His control, while the reverse is the case with\nAvidya which abides in Jiva. Kala is simply the activity of Isvara when in\nconjunction with Avyakta. Purusha is an _amsa_ or mere ray of Paramatman.\n\n#### The Thirty-six Principles of Saivagama.\n\n42-43\\. Adding to these Bindu and Nada, Sakti and Siva, Santa and Atita, the\ndoctors of Saivagama enumerate thirty-six principles.\n\np. 45\n\n_Bindu:_ the principle called Sadasiva, the Entity governing the whole\nexistence, and devoid of attributes. _Nada:_ another form of the same Being\nmanifested as Pranava, the illuminator of all things. _Sakti:_ a power\ndistinct from Maya and Avidya, and by which Isvara governs all. _Siva:_ He in\nwhom that power inheres, and who voluntarily assumes a body for the benefit of\ndevotees. _Santa_ (the Tranquil) and _Atita_ (the Transcendent) are only two\ndifferent aspects of Siva, as the Sruti says: \'\'This fire is verily Rudra\nHimself: of Him there are two bodies, one fierce, the other gentle." (\n_Tattiriya Samhita_ , 5-7-3).\n\n#### Vedic Doctrine of Maya.\n\nThe different principles enumerated above are none of them absolutely real in\nthemselves. According to the Sruti they are only manifestations of the one\nParabrahman caused by Maya. So the Vartikakara says:\n\n43-44\\. All the principles thus assumed existed in the Atman before, as the\nplant in the seed. By Maya, acting in the form of will, intelligence and\nactivity, have they been displayed.\n\np. 46\n\n44-45\\. Because every event is the result of will, intelligence and activity,\ntherefore it is certain that all creatures are so many Isvaras.\n\nThe universe proceeds from will, intelligence and activity which cannot inhere\nin any being other than Isvara endued with Maya. The universe is maintained,\nas we see, by the will, intelligence and activity inherent in the sentient\nexistence, in the Jivas. This sentient existence is therefore none other than\nIsvara, there being no evidence whatever by which to establish a distinction\nin consciousness pure and simple except what is caused by external conditions\nwith which it is associated. All volition, thought and activity being the\nresults of Maya, it is but right to maintain that the whole universe which\nthey bring into existence is made up of nothing but Maya.\n\np. 47\n\n45-47\\. From the seed is born the tree; again from that tree is another seed\nborn, and so on in succession. With a view to prevent such a supposition, the\nillustration of a Yogin has been adduced. The ancients such as Visvamitra,\nperfect in Samadhi, without any material instrument, without any personal end\nin view, by their mere will brought about creation complete with all\nenjoyments.\n\n48\\. Almighty as possessed of infinite power, independent as having nothing to\nresort to outside Himself, by His mere will He creates, preserves and destroys\nall.\n\nThe illustration by seed and plant may lead one to the conclusion that there\nare many Isvaras and many universes coming one after another, as cause and\neffect in turn. This is opposed to the teaching of the Sruti which says that\nIsvara is never born and never dies. The illustration of Yogin is intended to\navoid the opposite conclusion, by showing that Isvara is one and is the sole\ncreator of the universe.\n\np. 48\n\nNow the question arises as to how the immutable Isvara can be said to create,\npreserve, and destroy the universe. It is answered as follows:\n\n49\\. The Isvara does not create by way of operating on materials (external to\nHimself); self-conscious as He is, neither is He the knower by way of\noperating on pramanas or organs of perception.\n\nIsvara undergoes no change of state in Himself when He creates, preserves or\ndestroys the universe. If He were to perform these acts by actively operating\non the material cause with necessary instruments and so on, then He would be\nsubject to change of state, like a potter producing a pot. On the other hand,\nlike a king or a magnet, by mere presence He induces activity in His\nenvironment, without actively engaging in any act.\n\np. 49\n\n50-51\\. His consciousness and agency are quite absolute because of His\nindependence. In the very variety of His will consists His absolute freedom.\nWho can define the self-reliant will of Isvara by which He is free to act, or\nnot to act, or to act otherwise?\n\nHe is conscious and active independently of all else, without undergoing any\nchange in Himself. So, too, is His will characterized by thorough independence\nand absence of all obstruction.\n\n52\\. The Sruti also has declared Isvara\'s creation by will, in the words, "He\ndesired," and "From Him, the Atman, was akasa born."\n\nThus by way of comparing Isvara to the magician and to the Yogin, has been\nexpounded the Vedantic doctrine that Isvara is both the material and the\nefficient cause, as manifesting by force of His Maya the universe made up of\nnames and forms which cannot be spoken of as either real or unreal. As this\ndoctrine is taught in one harmonious voice by all the Upanishads, it should\nnot\n\np. 50\n\nbe set aside on the strength of evidence furnished from other sources of\nknowledge.\n\n#### Isvara is not a mere efficient cause.\n\n53\\. If the Supreme Lord were merely the efficient cause of this universe,\nlike a potter He would be subject to change and liable to death.\n\nIt cannot be that, like the potter operating with external instruments upon an\nexternal material cause, Isvara is merely the efficient cause of the universe;\nfor none can operate upon things external to himself without himself\nundergoing change. Like other operators He should have been endowed with a\nbody, which would make Him liable to decay. Accordingly the conception that\nIsvara is the mere efficient cause of the universe is opposed to the express\nteaching of the Vedanta that He is eternal and immutable.\n\nTo avoid the absurdity that has been shown to follow from the doctrine that\nIsvara is the mere efficient cause, the Vaiseshika may say that Isvara, as\nbelonging to the category of Atman, has the nine qualities (the last nine\nenumerated in vartika 23) including ichchha (desire or will) inherent in\n\np. 51\n\n[paragraph continues] His nature, _i.e._ , independent of a body. But this\n-would lead to another absurdity, as shown below:\n\n54\\. If the nine qualities including intellect were eternal coinhering\nattributes of Isvara, then, endowed as He is with eternal will, He should\nconstantly be engaged in the creation of the universe.\n\n55\\. In the absence of all cessation of activity, samsara would never cease.\nThe teaching as to moksha would be vain, and the Revelation would be of no\npurpose.\n\n56\\. Wherefore the Isvara\'s creation of the universe is all a display of Maya,\nand all worldly experience including Revelation as to bondage and liberation\nis (the effect) of Maya.\n\np. 52\n\n57\\. Thus ends the second chapter in brief in the work called Manasollasa\nwhich expounds the meaning of the Hymn to the Blessed Dakshinamurti.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter III.
