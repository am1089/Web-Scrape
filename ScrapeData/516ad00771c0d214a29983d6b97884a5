He must persist in keeping his mind and his organs of sense under\nrestraint.\n\n2\\. Restraint of the mind implies restraint of the senses.\n\n3\\. One who has acquired complete command over himself, gains this world and\nthe next.\n\n4\\. One who has no command over himself, reaps no fruit from any of his acts\n(whether worldly or tending to the acquisition of spiritual merit).\n\n5\\. Self-restraint is the best instrument of purification; self-restraint is\nthe best of auspicious objects; by self-restraint he obtains anything he may\ndesire in his heart.\n\n6\\. The man who rides (as it were) in a chariot drawn by his five senses and\ndirected by his mind (as the charioteer), who keeps it on the path of the\nvirtuous, can never be overcome by his enemies (lust, wrath, and greed),\nunless the horses (unrestrained by the charioteer) run away with the chariot.\n\n7\\. As the waters (of all streams) are stored up (and reabsorbed) in the\nocean, which, though being filled with them, remains unmoved and tranquil,\neven so that man, in whose mind the passions are stored up (and dissolved),\nobtains perfect calmness but not he who strives after the gratification of his\ndesires.\n\n[LXXII. 7 = Bhagavad-gita, 70.
