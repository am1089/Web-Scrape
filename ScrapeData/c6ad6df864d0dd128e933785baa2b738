But (there is) denotation of the superintending (deities), on account of\ndistinction and entering.\n\nThe word 'but' is meant to set aside the objection started. In texts such as\n'to him the earth said,' the terms 'earth' and so on, denote the divinities\npresiding over earth and the rest.--How is this known?--' Through distinction\nand connexion.' For earth and so on are denoted by the distinctive term\n'divinities'; so e.g. 'Let me enter into those three divinities' ( _Kh_. Up.\nVI, 3, 2), where fire, water, and earth are called divinities; and Kau. Up.\nII, 14, 'All divinities contending with each other as to pre-eminence,' and\n'all these divinities having recognised pre-eminence in pra _n_ a.' The\n'entering' of the Sutra refers to Ait. Ar. II, 4, 2, 4, 'Agni having become\nspeech entered into the mouth; Aditya having become sight entered into the\neyes,' &c., where the text declares that Agni and other divine beings entered\ninto the sense-organs as their superintendents.\n\nWe therefore adhere to our conclusion that the world, being non-intelligent\nand hence essentially different in nature from Brahman, cannot be the effect\nof Brahman; and that therefore, in agreement with Sm _ri_ ti confirmed by\nreasoning, the Vedanta-texts must be held to teach that the Pradhana is the\nuniversal material cause. This prima facie view is met by the following Sutra.\n\n6\\. But it is seen.\n\nThe 'but' indicates the change of view (introduced in the present Sutra). The\nassertion that Brahman cannot be the material cause of the world because the\nlatter differs from it in essential nature, is unfounded; since it is a matter\nof observation that even things of different nature stand to each other in the\nrelation of cause and effect. For it is observed that from honey and similar\nsubstances there originate worms and other little animals.--But it has been\nsaid above that in those cases there is sameness of nature,\n\np. 418\n\nin so far as the relation of cause and effect holds good only between the non-\nintelligent elements in both!--This assertion was indeed made, but it does not\nsuffice to prove that equality of character between cause and effect which you\nhave in view. For, being apprehensive that from the demand of equality of\ncharacter in some point or other only it would follow that, as all things have\ncertain characteristics in common, anything might originate from anything, you\nhave declared that the equality of character necessary for the relation of\ncause and effect is constituted by the persistence, in the effect, of those\ncharacteristic points which differentiate the cause from other things. But it\nis evident that this restrictive rule does not hold good in the case of the\norigination of worms and the like from honey and so on; and hence it is not\nunreasonable to assume that the world also, although differing in character\nfrom Brahman, may originate from the latter. For in the case of worms\noriginating from honey, scorpions from dung, &c., we do _not_ observe--what\nindeed we _do_ observe in certain other cases, as of pots made of clay,\nornaments made of gold--that the special characteristics distinguishing the\ncausal substance from other things persist in the effects also.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 7.
