The Ri _s_ is (of the Naimi _s_ a forest) addressed Suta (fondly) :-- O\nhighly Fortunate One! Your nectar-like words are very sweet. We are not\nsatiated with what you have described to us as the auspicious sayings of\nDvaipayana Vyasa. O Suta! We desire to ask you again to narrate to us the\nauspicious sayings of this Pura _n_ a, beautiful, famous, and sin-destroying\nand authorised by the holy Vedas. Vis'vakarma had a son, named Vritrasura, who\nwas very well known, and very powerful. How was it that he had been slain by\nthe high-souled Indra? Vis'vakarma was a powerful Brahmi _n_ and belonged to\nthe gods' party; his son was stronger. How was it that he had been killed by\nIndra! The Devas are born of the Sattva qualities; men are born from the\nRajasic qualities; and all the birds, etc., are born of the Tamasic qualities.\nThis is the opinion of the Pundits, versed in the Pura _n_ as and \xc3\x82gamas. But\nin this act of slaying Vritrasura, a great contradiction arises; for the\npowerful Vritra was killed merely under a pretext by Indra, the performer of\nthe hundred sacrifices, and endowed with Sattva qualities. And Indra was\nprompted to do so by Vi _sn_ u, the head of those who possess Sattva\nqualities; while Vi _sn_ u himself entered in disguise into the thunderbolt so\nthat he could kill Vritra. The powerful Vritra entered into a treaty and kept\nhimself peaceful when Indra and Vi _sn_ u violated truth and treacherously\nkilled him by Jalaphena (the watery foams). O Suta! The great wonder is this\n:-- That Indra and Vi _sn_ u turned out so bold as to forsake the truth. This,\nthen, is therefore very clear that the high souled persons become deluded and\nact sinfully. The Heads of the Devas act very wrongly; they are reckoned as\npolite simply because they observe the mere outward forms of good conduct as\napproved by the S'astras. How can the mere observance of outward forms\nconstitute politeness? Had Indra, who killed in disguise Vritra relying on his\nwords, to suffer any punishment for the sin that he incurred in killing a\nBrahma _n_ a? It was told by you before that Vritra had been slain by the Devi\nBhagavati; but the general belief is that Indra killed him. Our minds are\npuzzled on this point. (So clear our doubts on this point.)\n\n\n\np. 482\n\n\n\n13-14. Suta said :-- O Munis! Hear the incident of the killing of Vritrasura\nand the punishment that Indra had to suffer due to his sin of Brahmahatya\n(killing a Brahmi _n_ ). This question was asked by the King Parik _s_ it and\nreplied by Vyasa, the son of Satyavati. I will tell you what Vyasa had told\nbefore.\n\n\n\n15-18. Janamejaya asked :-- O Best of Munis! How was it that in former days\nIndra, endowed with the Sattva qualities, killed Vritrasura, with the aid of\nVi _sn_ u? And how and why was it that he was killed again by the Goddess\nBhagavati? O Lord of Munis! How could one body be killed by the two; our\ncuriosity has been excited to hear the truth. What man is there that does not\nlike to hear any more of the glorious deeds of the high-souled persons! Kindly\nnarrate to us the slaying of Vritra by the Devi Bhagavati.\n\n\n\n19-26. Vyasa said :-- O King! You are blessed, since your taste to hear the\nevents of Pura _n_ a has grown so much; the Devas even get their thirst for\ndrinking nectar; but when quenched, they do not like to drink any more. O\nKing! Your name and fame are widely spread. Your Bhakti (devotion) to the Pura\n_n_ as is growing more and more daily. A speaker gets very much delighted when\nhis audience hears him with undivided attention. O Lord of the earth! The\nfight between Vritra and Vasava that occurred in days of yore is famous in the\npassages of the Vedas and the Pura _n_ as; as well as the suffering that Indra\nhad to encounter as his punishment when he had killed the innocent son of\nVisvakarma. O King! The Munis, who fear sin very much, commit yet blameable\nacts under Maya; then what wonder is there that Vi _sn_ u, and Indra would\nkill Tris'ira and Vritra merely under a plea. When Vi _sn_ u, the incarnate of\nSattva qualities, gets deluded by Maya and kills deceitfully the Daityas\nalways, then how can you expect any other man to conquer mentally even the\nMaha Maya Bhavani, Who deludes all the beings! O King! It is under the\ncompulsion of this Maya that the Bhagavan, the Infinite, the friend of Nara,\nNarayana, takes incarnations in thousands and thousands of Yugas in this\nSamsara as Fish, etc., and does deeds sometimes lawful and sometimes unlawful.\nThe Devas and men, being confounded by his Maya, become upset and disordered\nand say \xc2\x93that this body, wealth, house, sons, wife and relatives are all mine\xc2\x94\nand being thus deluded sometimes do virtuous and sometimes sinful deeds. O\nKing! There is not even one, on the surface of this earth, though he may be\nwell versed in finding out cause and effect, the knowledge of the high and\nlow, that can be free from this Great Delusion; he is from the very beginning\ntied up by the three Gu _n_ as of this Maya and that remains under Her\ncontrol.\n\n\n\np. 483\n\n\n\n27-35. This explains that Vi _sn_ u and Indra both were deluded by Maya and\nengaged in fulfilling their own selfish ends. They killed Vritras'ura under a\npretext. O King! Hear! I am now describing to you the cause of enmity between\nlndra and Vritra. Vis'vakarma, the Prajapati, was great architect of the Gods,\nhe was skilled, he was superior amongst the gods, a great ascetic and endeared\nby the Brahmi _n_ s. He had enmity with Indra; and out of this enmity he\ncreated a son, very beautiful named him Tris'iraska Visvarupa. That son had\nthree faces very beautiful and lovely. Visvarupa performed three different\nfunctions with his three different faces; with one, he used to study the\nVedas, with the second he used to drink nectar (wine), and with the third he\nused to see simultaneously all the directions. Tris'ira renounced the\npleasures of the world and began to practise a hard tapasya; he became a great\nascetic, gentle, restrained in his passions and entirely devoted to his\nreligion. He practised Panchagni-Sadhan in the summer season, tying his feet\nupwards on the branch of a tree with his head downwards; he remained in dew in\nthe cold season, under water in the winter season. Thus he abstained from food\nand conquered his self and, forsaking all the worldly connections, practised a\nvery hard tapasya; very difficult, indeed, for those who are of dull\nintellects.\n\n\n\n36-49. Indra became very sad and dispirited to see him practise such a Tapasya\nand thought of the means so that he might not acquire his Indraship. The\nPakasas'ana Indra remained always very anxious see the energetic penance\npractised by that ascetic of unbounded glory and his steady attachment towards\nit. He thought thus :-- \xc2\x93This Tris'ira is becoming stronger day by day by his\npenance, so he will kill me. The wise never look an enemy with indifference\nwhose strength daily becomes greater and greater.\xc2\x94 It is now my urgent duty to\ninvent means how to baffle his Tapasya and he at last settled that lust is the\ngreat enemy of asceticism; the practice of devout austerities is destroyed\ncomplete by lust; so I must try this very day how the Muni becomes attached to\nworldly lust and enjoyments. The intelligent Indra, thinking thus, called the\nApsaras Urvas'i, Menaka, Rambha, Ghritachi, and Tilottama and others proud of\ntheir beauties so that they might seduce Tri'sira, the son of Vi'svakarma. O\nApsaras! I have now got a very grave task to fulfil; all of you help me in\nthis respect. A great enemy of mine, difficult to conquer, is practising\npenance with his self-controlled. Start at once and with your dress suited to\nvarious amorous gestures and try hard to seduce him. Be all well with you;\nseduce him and remove the fever of my heart. O Apsaras! What more shall I say,\nI am restless since I have heard of his strength performing such hard\nausterities. O Weak Ones ! That powerful\n\n\n\np. 484\n\n\n\nascetic may acquire my place and thus dispossess me; this fear has possessed\nme. Therefore destroy my fear as quickly as possible. This is the task now\ngiven to you; get united and do this good to me. The Apsaras, hearing him,\nbowed down and said :-- \xc2\x93O Lord of the Devas! Do not be afraid! We will try\nour best to seduce him. O highly Lustrous One! For the enticing away of the\nMuni, we will do all the things, dancing, music and other amorous gestures and\npractices, that will discard your fear. O King of the Gods! We will unsettle\nthe mind of the Muni by our side glances and passionate gestures and postures,\ndelude and tie him and then bring him under our control.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n50-60. Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus saying, the Apsaras went to Tris'ira and\nbegan to exhibit various amorous gestures and postures as stated in the Kama\nSastra. They began to sing sometimes, sometimes to dance in tune with musical\nmeasures before the Muni. In short, they practised various amorous gestures to\nentice him away. But that ascetic, blazing with the fire of Tapas, did not\nnotice even the Apsaras' various attempts; rather he kept all his senses under\nthe control and remained like a deaf, dumb, and blind man. In that lovely\nhermitage of the Muni, the Apsaras sang and danced ravishingly and remained a\nfew days there. But when they saw that the Muni Tris'ira did not swerve a bit\nfrom his meditative posture they returned tired, distressed to Indra and all,\nvery fearful, began to address Indra with folded hands :-- \xc2\x93O King! We tried\nour best and we could not in any way make the Muni unsteady, very hard to\nsurmount. O Pakas'asana! Please invent other means; we could not make the\nself-controlled Muni move away an inch from his position; it is our good luck\nthat that high-souled Muni, an incarnate of blazing fire have not cursed us!\xc2\x94\nThen dismissing the Apsaras, the evil-minded and dull Indra began to devise\nmeans, though totally unlawful, how to kill that good Muni. O King! That Indra\nabandoned all shame, and fear of sin and ultimately came to a highly blameable\nand sinful conclusion how to kill him.\n\n\n\nHere ends the First Chapter of the Sixth Book on Tris'ira's austerities in\nS'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam the Maha Pura _n_ am, of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i\nVeda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 2](bk06ch02.htm)\n\n"
