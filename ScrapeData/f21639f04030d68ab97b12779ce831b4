Delivery and receipt ought to be equal.\n\n4. 4 If the depositary fails to restore the deposit to the depositor as he ought, he shall be compelled to restore it by forcible means, after his guilt has been proved by ordeals or other (modes of proof).\n\n* 5. 5 If one article hidden in another is deposited in another man's house, without stating (what it is), it is termed an Aupanidhika deposit.\n\n* 6. 6 Deposits are again divided into two species, attested and unattested ones. They must be restored precisely in the same condition (as they were in at the time of their delivery). Otherwise an ordeal must take place.\n\n* 7. 7 The wicked man who does not return a deposit, on being asked to do so by the depositor, shall be punished by the king. If the deposit has\n\np. 122\n\nbeen lost or destroyed, he shall make good its value.\n\n* 8. 8 If he derives profit from a deposit, by using it without the consent of the depositor, he shall be punished likewise, and shall restore the profit, together with interest, to the depositor.\n\n* 9. If a deposit is lost, together with the property of the depositary, the loss shall be the depositary's. The same rule shall obtain, if the loss has been caused by fate or by the king; unless (the depositary) should have acted fraudulently.\n\n10. 10 The depositor being dead, if the depositary restores the deposit to his next-of-kin, of his own accord, he must not be harassed either by the king or by the relations of the depositor.\n\n11. 11 (The rightful owner) shall try to recover it amicably, without resorting to stratagems. Or he shall explore (the depositary's) mode of living, and cause him to restore it by friendly expostulations.\n\np. 123\n\n12. 12 What has been stolen by thieves, carried away by water, or burnt by fire, need not be restored (by the depositary), unless he should have appropriated something out of it.\n\n* 13. 13 He who fails to restore a deposit, and he who demands what he never deposited, shall both be punished like thieves, and shall be made to pay a sum equal (in amount to the value of the deposit).\n\n* 14. 14 The same law applies in the case of Ya _k_ ita, Anvahita, and other such deposits, articles made over to an artist, Nyasa and Pratinyasa deposits.\n\n* 15. 15 If a man takes charge of a wealthy boy, the law is also the same. These six cases are equal (from a legal point of view).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[120:1](sbe3334.htm#fr_344) II, 1. With one in whom he places no confidence, a\nman will not deposit a single cowry even, without the guarantee of a written\nreceipt or of witnesses. On the other hand, he will deposit a thousand _S_\nuvar _n_ as even, without a receipt or witnesses, with one in whose honesty he\nplaces implicit reliance. A.\n\n[120:2](sbe3334.htm#fr_345) A prudent man may entrust a deposit to one endowed\nwith the seven qualities here mentioned, because he feels sure that he may\nrecover his property at any time. A. The term mahapaksha, 'influential,' means\nliterally one who has many friends and relations. Identical with Manu VIII,\n179.\n\n[120:3](sbe3334.htm#fr_346) Thus, e.g. a sealed deposit must be returned with\nthe seal, a deposit made before witnesses must be restored in the presence of\nthe same witnesses. See Jolly, translation of Book VIII of the Code of Manu.\nIdentical with Manu VIII, 180.\n\n[121:4](sbe3334.htm#fr_347) Where the depositary, actuated by interested\nmotives, refuses to restore the deposit, and is convicted of his guilt in a\ncourt of justice, by an ordeal or by other proof, he must restore it and pay\ntwice its value as a fine. A. Manu VIII, 190.\n\n[121:5](sbe3334.htm#fr_348) 'One article hidden in another,' such as e.g. a\npearl necklace tied up with a particular sort of knot in a cloth. Such a\ndeposit must be restored in the same condition as before, and tied with those\nvery knots with which it was originally delivered. A. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II,\n65.\n\n[121:6](sbe3334.htm#fr_349) If a deposit has been handed over to the\ndepositary in the presence of witnesses, it must be restored before witnesses.\nIf no witnesses were present at the time of its delivery, they may be equally\ndispensed with at the time when it is returned to the depositor. If it is not\nreturned to him, the depositary must perform an ordeal or make an oath, &c. A.\n\n[121:7](sbe3334.htm#fr_350) The last clause concerns a deposit which has not\nbeen returned on demand. In that case, a calamity arising through fate or the\nking affects the depositary, and not the depositor. A. Manu VIII, 191; Vish\n_n_ u V, 169-171.\n\n[122:8](sbe3334.htm#fr_351) If the depositary without the knowledge of the\ndepositor derives gain from the use of the deposit he shall be punished, and\nshall make over his gain, together with interest, to the depositor. A. Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 67.\n\n[122:10](sbe3334.htm#fr_352) If, the depositor being dead, the depositary\nthrough honesty restores the deposit to his nearest relative and heir, without\nhaving been asked to do so, or without the existence of the deposit being\nknown to the heir, he must not be harassed by the relatives of the depositor\nasserting, 'He has not restored all,' or by the king. A. Manu VIII, 186.\n\n[122:11](sbe3334.htm#fr_353) Naraya _n_ a, in commenting on Manu VIII, 187,\nobserves that this rule applies to one who believes a deposit to be with\nanother, but has not made it over himself. He shall try to recover the deposit\namicably; or he shall ascertain whether the depositary has made extraordinary\nexpenses, and may therefore be suspected to have embezzled the deposit. Other\ncommentators explain this text in a different manner. See Professor Buhler's\nnote on Manu VIII, 187. Nearly identical with Manu VIII, 187.\n\n[123:12](sbe3334.htm#fr_354) If, however, he is convicted, by the performance\nof an ordeal, of having derived some profit from the deposit, he shall restore\nhis gains. A. Nearly identical with Manu VIII, 189.\n\n[123:13](sbe3334.htm#fr_355) Either of the two criminals here mentioned must\nbe punished like a thief and pay the value of the deposit as a fine. A. Nearly\nidentical with Manu VIII, 191.\n\n[123:14](sbe3334.htm#fr_356) Ya _k_ ita is what has been borrowed for use,\nespecially clothes and ornaments, which have been borrowed on the occasion of\na wedding or other festival. Anvahita is a deposit, which has been delivered\nby the depositor to a third person, on condition of its being returned\nafterwards to the owner. 'Articles made over to an artist' are materials to be\nworked by an artizan, as e.g. gold delivered to a goldsmith to be made into an\nearring. Nyasa is a secret deposit, which has been handed over to some one\ninhabitant of the house, behind the back of the house-owner. Pratinyasa is a\nmutual bailment, both parties exchanging deposits with one another. Asahaya,\nVi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ane _s_ vara, Mitrami _s_ ra, &c. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 67.\n\n[123:15](sbe3334.htm#fr_357) If a man takes a wealthy boy who has no guardian\ninto his house, the property of the boy is subject to the above rules\nregarding deposits.
