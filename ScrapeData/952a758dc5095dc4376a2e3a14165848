Scripture, he argues, proclaims injunctions such as the following one,\n'He who is desirous of the heavenly world is to sacrifice.' Now as it is\nadmitted that such scriptural injunctions must have an object, we conclude\nthat the sacrifice itself brings about the result, i.e. the obtainment of the\nheavenly world; for if this were not so, nobody would perform sacrifices and\nthereby scriptural injunctions would be rendered purposeless.--But has not\nthis view of the matter already been abandoned, on the ground that an action\nwhich passes away as soon as done can have no fruit?--We must, the reply is,\nfollow the authority of scripture and assume such a connexion of action and\nfruit as agrees with scriptural statement. Now it is clear that a deed cannot\neffect a result at some future time, unless, before passing away, it gives\nbirth to some unseen result; we therefore assume that there exists some result\nwhich we call apurva, and which may be viewed either as an imperceptible\nafter-state of the deed or as an imperceptible antecedent state of the result.\nThis hypothesis removes all difficulties, while on the other hand it is\nimpossible that the Lord should effect the results of actions. For in the\nfirst place, one uniform cause cannot be made to account for a great variety\nof effects; in the second place, the Lord would have to be taxed with\npartiality and cruelty; and in the third place, if the deed itself did not\nbring about its own fruit, it would be useless to perform it at all.--For all\nthese reasons the result springs from the deed only, whether meritorious or\nnon-meritorious.\n\n41\\. Badaraya _n_ a, however, thinks the former (i.e. the Lord, to be the\ncause of the fruits of action), since he is designated as the cause (of the\nactions themselves).\n\np. 183\n\nThe teacher Badaraya _n_ a thinks that the previously-mentioned Lord is the\ncause of the fruits of action. The word 'however' sets aside the view of the\nfruit being produced either by the mere deed or the mere apurva.--The final\nconclusion then is that the fruits come from the Lord acting with a view to\nthe deeds done by the souls, or, if it be so preferred, with a view to the\napurva springing from the deeds. This view is proved by the circumstance of\nscripture representing the Lord not only as the giver of fruits but also as\nthe causal agent with reference to all actions whether good or evil. Compare\nthe passage, Kau. Up. III, 8, 'He makes him whom he wishes to lead up from\nthese worlds do a good deed; and the same makes him whom he wishes to lead\ndown from these worlds do a bad deed.' The same is said in the Bhagavadgita\n(VII, 21), 'Whichever divine form a devotee wishes to worship with faith, to\nthat form I render his faith steady. Holding that faith he strives to\npropitiate the deity and obtains from it the benefits he desires, as ordained\nby me.'\n\nAll Vedanta-texts moreover declare that the Lord is the only cause of all\ncreation. And his creating all creatures in forms and conditions corresponding\nto--and retributive of--their former deeds, is just what entitles us to call\nthe Lord the cause of all fruits of actions. And as the Lord has regard to the\nmerit and demerit of the souls, the objections raised above--as to one uniform\ncause being inadequate to the production of various effects, &c.--are without\nany foundation.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 1](sbe38144.htm)\n\n"
