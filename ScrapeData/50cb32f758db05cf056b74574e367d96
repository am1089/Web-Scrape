I bring forward my most powerful, entirely new (pious) thought (i. e.\nhymn). the prayer of my words [1](sbe46041.htm#an_1:143:1:1) to Agni, the son\nof strength; he is the child of the Waters [2](sbe46041.htm#an_1:143:1:2), the\nbeloved one, who together with the Vasus has sat down on the Earth as a Hot\n_ri_ observing the appointed time (for sacrificing).\n\n2\\. Being born in the highest heaven Agni became visible to Matari _s_ van. By\nthe power of his mind, by his greatness when kindled, his flame filled Heaven\nand Earth with light.\n\n3 [1](sbe46041.htm#an_1:143:3:1). His flames are fierce; never ageing are the\nflames of him who is beautiful to behold, whose face is beautiful, whose\nsplendour is beautiful. The never sleeping, never ageing (rays) of Agni whose\npower is light, roll forward like streams across the nights (?)\n[2](sbe46041.htm#an_1:143:3:2).\n\n4\\. Him the all-wealthy, whom the Bh _ri_ gus have set to work on the navel of\nthe earth, with the whole power of the world\n[1](sbe46041.htm#an_1:143:4:1)--stir up that Agni by thy prayers in his own\nhouse--(him) who alone rules over goods like Varu _n_ a.\n\n5\\. He who is not to be kept back like the roar of the Maruts, like an army\n[1](sbe46041.htm#an_1:143:5:1)that is sent forward, like the thunderbolt of\nheaven--Agni eats with his sharp jaws, he chews, he throws down the forests as\na warrior throws down his foes.\n\n6\\. Would Agni eagerly come to our hymn? Would He the Vasu together with the\nVasus fulfil our desire? Will He, the driver, stir our prayers\n\np. 158\n\nthat they may be successful? (Thus thinking) I praise Him whose face is\nbright, with this my prayer.\n\n7\\. He who has kindled him strives [1](sbe46041.htm#an_1:143:7:1) towards Agni\nas towards Mitra (or, towards a friend)--(to Agni) whose face shines with\nghee, the charioteer of _Ri_ ta. May he who when kindled becomes a racer\n[2](sbe46041.htm#an_1:143:7:2), shining at the sacrifices\n[3](sbe46041.htm#an_1:143:7:3), lift up our bright-coloured prayer.\n\n8 [1](sbe46041.htm#an_1:143:8:1). Preserve us, O Agni, never failing with thy\nnever-failing, kind and mighty guardians; protect our people all around with\nthose undeceived, undismayed, never slumbering (guardians), O thou our wish\n[2](sbe46041.htm#an_1:143:8:2)!\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi. Metre, _G_ agati; the last verse Trish _t_ ubh. The hymn\nhas been translated by Kaegi, Siebenzig Lieder des Rigveda, p. 100.--Verse 7 =\nTB. I, 2, 1, 12.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Comp. VIII, 59, 6. va _k_ a _h_ matim.\n\nNote 2. Agni who is considered as born from the Waters, is identified several\ntimes with a god who, like Matari _s_ van, in my opinion had an independent\norigin, with Apam napat ('Child of the Waters'). Comp. Bergaigne, Rel.\nVedique, II, 17 seq.; H. O., Religion des Veda, 118 seq.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. There is no sufficient reason for transposing verses 3 and 4 (Kaegi).\n\nNote 2. Probably we should read ati aktu\xc2\xb4n; comp. VI, 4, 5. ati eti aktu\xc2\xb4n.--\nSee Bergaigne, Melanges Renier, p. 96.\n\np. 159\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Bhuvanasya seems to depend on ma _g_ mana; comp. VII, 82, 5.\nbhuvanasya ma _g_ mana.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Pischel (Vedische Studien, I. 231) seems to me to be right in denying\nthat sena ever means 'Geschoss,' and in translating sena s _ri_ sh _t_ a\xc2\xb4\n'exercitus effusus.' The opinion of Prof. von Bradke and Prof. Bloomfield is\ndifferent; see Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl. Gesellschaft, XLVI, 456;\nXLVIII, 549.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. The text adds the dativus ethicus va _h_ , 'for you' (comp. Delbruck,\nAltindische Syntax, 206), which can scarcely be translated.\n\nNote 2. Geldner (Vedische Studien, I, 168) has shown that akra very probably\nmeans 'horse.' Agni is very frequently compared to a horse.--Comp. Ludwig,\nUeber die neuesten Arbeiten auf dem Gebiete der Rigveda-Forschung, p. 54;\nRoth, Zeitschrift der D. Morg. Ges., XLVIII, 118.\n\nNote 3. See above, I, 31, 6, note 2.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. With Padas C D compare the verse VI, 8, 7. adabdhebhi _h_ tava\ngopa\xc2\xb4bhi _h_ ish _t_ e asma\xc2\xb4kam pahi trishadhastha suri\xc2\xb4n.\n\nNote 2. 'What is ish _t_ e? Is it thou our wish, or thou our sacrifice?' M. M.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 144](sbe46042.htm)\n\n"
