Increase _G_ atavedas by your sacrifice [1](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:1:1),\nworship Agni for ever with your offering and your prayer\n[2](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:1:2)--him who has been kindled, the receiver of good\nofferings, the solar hero, the heavenly Hot _ri_ , the charioteer\n[3](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:1:3) in our settlements [4](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:1:4).\n\n2\\. For thee Nights and Dawns have been lowing, O Agni, as milch-cows in the\nfolds for their calf [1](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:2:1). A steward\n[2](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:2:2), as it were, of Heaven, thou shinest on the human\ntribes, O bountiful one, on continuous nights [3](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:2:3).\n\n3\\. The gods have set him to work, as a steward [1](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:3:1)\nof Heaven and Earth, endowed with wonderful power, at the bottom of the air:\nAgni who is well known like a chariot [2](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:3:2), brightly\nshining, deserving of praise like Mitra (or, like a friend) in (human)\ndwellings.\n\n4\\. They have established him who grows in the air, in his house, the serpent\n[1](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:4:1) with beautiful splendour like gold\n[2](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:4:2), the winged (son?) of P _ri_ _s_ ni\n[3](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:4:3) who lights up with his eyes both tribes (of gods\nand of men), like a guardian of the way (?) [4](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:4:4).\n\n5\\. May he, the Hot _ri_ , encompass the whole sacrifice. Men strive towards\nhim with offerings and prayer. (Agni) with golden jaws\n[1](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:5:1), hurrying around in the growing (plants)\n[2](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:5:2), lighted up the two worlds like the Sky with the\nstars.\n\n6\\. Thus mayst thou, being brightly kindled for our welfare or being exhausted\n(?) [1](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:6:1), shine upon us with thy wealth. Carry hither\nto us the two\n\np. 194\n\nworlds for the sake of happiness, Agni, O god, that they may eagerly partake\n[2](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:6:2) of the offering of the man (or, of Manus).\n\n7\\. Give us, Agni, mighty, give us thousandfold (gifts). Open strength for us\nlike a door [1](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:7:1) for the sake of glory. Make Heaven\nand Earth inclined towards us through (our) spell. Make the Dawns shine like\nthe brilliant Sun.\n\n8\\. Being kindled after dawns and nights may he shine with his red light like\nthe sun, Agni, being a good sacrificer with the help of the offerings of man\n(or, of Manus) [1](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:8:1), the king of the clans, and the\nwelcome guest of \xc3\x82yu.\n\n9\\. Thus, O Agni, ancient one, our human prayer has prospered among the\nimmortals who dwell in the great heaven. May the cow\n[1](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:9:1) when milked, yield [2](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:9:2)\nfreely to the singer in our settlements hundredfold (wealth) of all kinds.\n\n10\\. May we, O Agni, (attain) bliss in valiant men by our racers, or may we\nshine over (all) people by our sacred spells. May our unconquerable lustre\nbeam on high like the sun over the fivefold dwellings (of the five peoples).\n\n11\\. Be thou, O mighty one, worthy of praise among us, (thou) from whom the\nwell-born, liberal (lords) have sought nourishment\n[1](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:11:1), unto whom the strong ones, O Agni, go for\nsacrifice, who shinest in thy abode among (the worshipper's) own kith.\n\n12\\. May we both, O _G_ atavedas, the praisers and the liberal (lords), be in\nthy protection, O Agni. Help us to good, resplendent, abundant wealth which is\naccompanied by offspring, by good progeny.\n\n13 = II, 1, 16.\n\np. 195\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi and metre.--Verse 7 = TS. II, 2, 12, 6; MS. IV, 12, 2.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. In this Pada one syllable is wanting. It may be thought that the first\nword should be pronounced ia _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ena. For supplying the missing syllable\nby conjecture there would, however, be many ways. Comp. also H. O., Hymnen des\nRig-veda, I, p. 79.\n\nNote 2. Tana gira\xc2\xb4: comp. I. 38, 13 (vol. xxxii, p. 82).\n\nNote 3. Dhu _h_ -sadam. The exact meaning is, 'who occupies a decisive\nposition.'\n\nNote 4. V _ri_ _g_ aneshu: comp. I, 60, 3, note 2.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Comp. VIII, 88, 1. abhi vatsam na svasareshu dhenava _h_ indram girbhi\n_h_ navamahe.\n\nNote 2. See I, 58, 7, note 1.\n\nNote 3. See Lanman, p. 482; Gaedicke, p. 89. 'During continuous nights.' M. M.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. See I, 58, 7, note 1.\n\nNote 2. Cf. VIII, 84, 1. ratham na vedyam.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. I follow the conjecture of Bohtlingk-Roth, who propose to read hvaram.\nComp. Atharva-veda IV, I, 2 (\xc3\x82 _s_ valayana _S_ rautasutra IV, 6, 3; _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85khayana _S_ rautasutra V, 9, 7). suru _k_ am hvaram. The meaning of the word\nis conjectural; comp. I, 141, 7, note 1. If we read hvare, the translation\ncould be 'brilliant like gold, in a hidden place.' (M. M.)\n\nNote 2. Comp. Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 52.\n\np. 196\n\nNote 3. Or, the winged (bird) of P _ri_ _s_ ni? No other passages which make\nAgni the son (or the bird) of P _ri_ _s_ ni are known to me.\n\nNote 4. The accent of pathas points to a genitive, dependent on payum, of a\nword which is, however, different from pa\xc2\xb4thas. Grassmann thinks that pathas\nis a lengthening for pathas, but Lanman (Noun-Inflection, 470) is quite right\nin observing that this is hard to believe in the first syllable of a Pada.\nShould we not correct the text and read patha _h_ (gen. sing. governed by\npayum)? The reading patha _h_ may be due to the influence of the neighbourhood\nof payum.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. See vol. xxxii, p. 301.\n\nNote 2. Comp. X, 92, I. _s_ ushkasu hari _n_ ishu _g_ arbhurat.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Ludwig translates sam-dadasva\xc2\xb4n: 'zum heile [dich selber] aufreibend;'\nGrassmann, 'oder seist erloschen du;' Gaedicke (p. 89), 'and wenn du\nverloschest;' Griffith, 'a liberal giver;' Neisser (Bezzenberger's Beitr. XIX,\n286), 'deine Kunst zusammennehmend.' Saya _n_ a says, 'sa _m_ dadasvan samyak\npraya _k_ _kh_ an.' Prof. Max Muller suggests, 'being a liberal benefactor.'\n\nNote 2. There was no reason for correcting deva-vitaye as Ludwig once\nproposed. He has himself abandoned this conjecture.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. As to this metaphor ('opening' strength or the like), comp. VIII, 5,\n21. uta na _h_ divya\xc2\xb4 _h_ isha _h_ \xe2\x80\xa6 apa dva\xc2\xb4raiva varshatha _h_ , and the\npassages collected by Dr. Hirzel, Gleichnisse and Metaphern im Rig-veda\n(Leipzig, 1890), 103.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. The third Pada is repeated in X, 11, 5.\n\np. 197\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. The milch-cow of course is the prayer.\n\nNote 2. Isha _n_ i seems to be an infinitive like parsha _n_ i nesha _n_ i\ntarisha _n_ i (Delbruck, Altindisches Verbum, 227; Neisser, Bezzenberger's\nBeitrage, XX, 43). I believe it to come from the root ish, 'to incite.' As to\nthe syntactical peculiarities of these infinitives, comp. Delbruck,\nAltindische Syntax, 416.\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. Ishay is a denominative from ish, as ur _g_ ay is derived from u\xc2\xb4r _g_\n(comp. \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana _S_ rautasutra V, 7, 3).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3. \xc3\x82pri Hymn](sbe46053.htm)\n\n"
