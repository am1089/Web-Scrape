Suta said:--O Munis! When the excellent Tamasi S\xc2\x92akti, the Goddess\npresiding over sleep came out from the eyes, mouth, nose, heart, etc., of the\nbody of the World-Guru Vi _sn_ u and rested in the celestial space, then the\npowerful Lord Vi _sn_ u began to yawn and got up. He saw the Prajapati Brahma,\nterrified and spoke to him in words, deep like rumbling in the clouds :-- \xc2\x93O\nBhagavan Padmayone! What makes you come here, and leave your tapasya? Why do\nyou look so terrified and anxious?\xc2\x94 Hearing this, Brahma said: \xc2\x93O Deva! The\ntwo very powerful and very terrible Daityas, Madhu Kai _t_ abha sprung from\nthe wax of Thy ears approached to kill me; terrified thus, I have come to\nThee. So, O Lord of the Universe! O Vasudeva! now I am quite out of senses and\nterrified; save me.\xc2\x94 Vi _sn_ u, then, said :-- \xc2\x93Now go and rest in peace,\nwithout any fear; let those two stupids, whose life has been well nigh\nexhausted, come to me for battle; I will certainly kill them.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nSuta said :-- While Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u, the Lord of all the Devas, was thus\nsaying, those two very powerful Danavas, elated with pride, came up there, in\ntheir search for Brahma. O Munis! The two proud Daityas stood there in the\nmidst of the Pralaya water without anything to stand on and with calm\nattitude. They then spoke to Brahma as follows :-- O You have fled and come\nhere? You cannot escape. Go on and fight. I will kill You before this one.\n\n\n\nThen I will kill him also who sleeps on this bed of serpent. Either give us\nbattle or acknowledge yourself as our servant. Hearing their words, Janardan\nVisnu addressed them as follows:-- \xc2\x93O two Danavas, mad for war! Come and fight\nwith me as you like; I will surely curb your pride. O two powerful ones! If\nyou trust me, come and fight\xc2\x94. Hearing this, the two Danavas in the midst of\nthat mass of water rest-\n\n\n\np. 30\n\n\n\ning without any support, came up there to fight, with their eyes rolling with\nanger. The Daitya, named Madhu, became very angry, came up quickly to fight\nwhile Kai _t_ abha remained where he stood. Then the hand-to-hand fight ensued\nbetween the two mad athletes; Bhagavan Hari and Madhu became tired; Kai _t_\nabha came up and began to fight. After that Madhu and Kai _t_ abha joined and,\nblind with rage, began to fight again and again hand to hand with the very\npowerful Vi _sn_ u. And Bhagavan Brahma and the Prime Force \xc3\x82dya S\xc2\x92akti\nwitnessed this from the celestial Heavens. So the fight lasted for a long,\nlong, time; yet the two Danavas did not feel a bit tired: rather Bhagavan Vi\n_sn_ u became tired. Thus five thousand years passed away; Hari then began to\nponder over their mode of death. He thought :-- \xc2\x93I fought for five thousands\nof years but the two formidable Danavas have not been tired anything, rather I\nam tired; it is a matter of great surprise. Where has gone my prowess? and\nwhat for the two Danavas were not tired; What is the cause? This is a matter,\nnow, seriously to be thought over\xc2\x94. Seeing Bhagavan Hari thus sunk in cares,\nthe two haughty Danavas spoke to him with great glee and with a voice like\nthat of the rumbling of cloud :-- \xc2\x93O Vi _sn_ u ! If you feel tired, if you\nhave no sufficient strength to fight with us, then raise your folded palms on\nyour head and acknowledge that you are our servant; or if you can, go on\nfighting. O intelligent one!\n\nWe will take away your life first; and then slay this four-faced Brahma\xc2\x94.\nHearing the words of the two Danavas, resting there without any support in the\nvast ocean, the high-minded Vi _sn_ u spoke to them in sweet consoling words\n:-- \xc2\x93See, O heroes! no one ever fights with one who is tired, afraid, who is\nweaponless, who is fallen and who is a child; this is the Dharma of the\nheroes. Both of you fought with me for five thousands of years. But I am\nsingle handed; you are two, and both equally powerful and both of you took\nrest at intervals. I will therefore take rest for a while, and then fight with\ncertainty. Both of you are very powerful and very much elated in vanity.\nTherefore rest a while. After taking rest for a while I will fight with you\naccording to the just rules of warfare.\xc2\x94 Hearing these words of Hari, the two\nchief Danavas trusted and remained far aloof, ready to fight again.\n\n\n\nNow the four-armed Vasudeva, seeing them at a sufficient distance, began to\nponder in his mind thus :-- \xc2\x93How their death can be effected? Thinking for a\ntime, he came to know that they have been granted, by the Supreme S\xc2\x92akti Devi,\ndeath at their will (Ichchamrityu); and therefore they are not getting tired.\nI fought so long with them uselessly; my labour went in vain. How then can I\nnow fight, with this certain knowledge. Again if I do not fight, how these two\nDanavas, elated with their boon and\n\n\n\np. 31\n\n\n\ngiving troubles to all, be destroyed? When the boon is granted by the Devi\ntheir death is also well nigh impracticable. Who wants his own death, even\nplaced in very great distressed circumstances. Attacked by terrible diseases,\nreduced to indigent poverty no one wants to die; so how can it be expected\nthat these two haughty Danavas would want their death themselves? Therefore it\nis advisable me to take refuge of that \xc3\x82dya S\xc2\x92akti, the giver of the fruits of\nall desires. No desires can ever be fructified unless She is thoroughly\npleased. Thus thinking, Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u saw the beautiful Devi Yoga Nidra\nS\xc2\x92iva, shining in the air. Then the supreme Yogi, Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u, of\nimmeasurable spirit began to praise with folded palms that great Bhuvanes'vari\nMaha Kali, the giver of boons for the destruction of the Danavas. \xc2\x93O Devi! I\nbow down to Thee O Mahamaya, the Creatrix and Destructrix! Thou beginningless\nand deathless! O auspicious Chandike! The Bestower of enjoyment and liberation\nI do not know Thy Sagu _n_ a or Nirgu _n_ a forms; how then can I know Thy\nglorious deeds, innumerable as they are. To-day Thy undescribable prowess has\nbeen experienced by me, I being made senseless and unconscious by Thy power of\nsleep. Being tried again and again by Brahma with great care to bring me back\nto my consciousness, I could not become conscious, so much my senses were\ncontracted down. O Mother! By Thy power, Thou didst keep me unconscious and\nThou again hast freed me from sleep, and I also fought so many times. O giver\nof one's honour! Now I am tired; but Thou hast granted boon to the two Danavas\nand therefore they are not getting tired. These two Danavas, puffed up with\npride, were ready to kill Brahma; and therefore I challenged them to fight\nwith me and they too are fighting fiercely with me in this vast ocean. But\nThou hast granted them the wonderful boon that they will die whenever they\nwill; and therefore I have now come to Thy refuge, as Thou protectest those\nthat come under Thy shelter. Therefore, O Mother, the remover of the Devas'\ntroubles! These two Danavas are become exceedingly elated by Thy boon and I,\ntoo, am tired. Therefore dost Thou help me now. See! those two sinners are\nready to kill me; without Thy grace, what can I do now? and where to go?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n50-59. Thus praised by the eternal Vasudeva Jagannatha Hari, with humility and\npranams, the Devi Maha Kali, resting in the air, said smiling :-- \xc2\x93O Deva deva\nHari! Fight again; O Vi _sn_ u! These two heroes, when deluded by My Maya,\nwould be slain by you; I will delude them certainly, by My side long glance; O\nNarayana! then slay quickly the two Danavas, when conjured by My maya\xc2\x94.\n\n\n\nSuta said :-- Hearing these loving words of Bhagavati, Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u went\nto the scene of battle in the middle of that ocean, when the\n\n\n\np. 32\n\n\n\ntwo powerful Danavas of serene tempers and eager to light, became very glad on\nseeing Vi _sn_ u in the battle and said :-- \xc2\x93O four-armed one! we see your\ndesire is very lofty indeed; well stand! Stand! now be ready for battle,\nknowing that victory or defeat is surely dependent on Destiny. You should\nthink now thus :-- Though it is generally true that the more powerful one wins\nvictory; but it also happens sometimes that the weak gets the victory by queer\nturn of Fate; so the high souled persons should not be glad at their\nvictories, nor should express their sorrows at their defeat; so don\xc2\x92t be glad,\nthinking, that you on many former occasions fought with many Danavas who were\nyour enemies, and got the victory; nor be sorry that now you are defeated by\nthe two Danavas\xc2\x94. Thus saying, the powerful Madhu Kai _t_ abha came up to\nfight. Seeing this, Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u struck them immediately by fist with\ngreat violence; the two Danavas, elated with their strength, struck Hari in\nreturn with their fists. Thus fighting went on vigorously.\n\n\n\n60-87. Now seeing the two Danavas of great powers, fighting on incessantly,\nNarayana Hari cast a glance expressive of great distress, towards the face of\nthe Devi Mahakali. Seeing Vi _sn_ u thus distressed, the Devi laughed loudly\nand began to look constantly with eyes somewhat reddish and shot towards the\ntwo Asuras side-long glances, of love and amorous feelings which were like\narrows from the Cupid. The two vicious Daityas became fascinated by the side-\nlong glances of the Devi and took great pleasures in them; being extremely\nagitated by these amorous darts, looked with one steady gaze towards the Devi,\nof spotless lustre. Bhagavan Hari, too, saw the wonderful enchanting pastime\nof the Devi. Then Hari, perfectly expert in adopting means to secure ends,\nbegan to speak smiling and in voice like that of the rambling cloud, knowing\nthe two Danavas enchanted by Mahamaya, thus :--\n\n\n\nO two heroes! I am very glad at the mode of your fighting. So ask from me\nboons. I will grant that to you. I saw many Danavas before, fighting; but\nnever I saw them expert like you, nor I heard like this. I am therefore, very\nmuch satisfied by your such unrivalled powers. Therefore, O greatly powerful\npair of Danavas! I wish to grant both of you any boon that you want. Seeing\nthe Devi Mahamaya, the gladdener, of the Universe, the two Danavas felt\nthemselves amorous; and therefore they became proud on hearing Vi _sn_ u's\nthose words and told Vi _sn_ u, with their lotus-like eyes wide open, thus :--\n\n\n\nO Hari! what do you like to give us? We are not beggars; we do not want\nanything from you. O Lord of the Devas! Rather we will give you whatever you\ndesire; we are donors; not receivers. So O Vasudeva! Hri _s_ i Ke _s_ a! We\nare glad to see your- wonderful fight; so ask from\n\n\n\np. 33\n\n\n\nus any boon that you desire. Hearing their words, Bhagavan Janardan said :-- \xc2\x93\nIf you both are so much pleased with me, then I want this that both of you be\nkilled by me.\xc2\x94 Hearing these words of Vi _sn_ u, Madhu Kai _t_ abha became\nvery much wondered and thinking \xc2\x93we are now cheated\xc2\x94 remained for some time\nmerged in sorrow. Then reflecting that there is water everywhere and solid\nearth nowhere, they said :--\n\n\n\n\xc2\x93O Janardana Hari! We know that you are truthful; therefore now we want this\ndesired boon from you that you wanted to grant us before now grant us this\ndesired boon of ours. O Madhusudana! We will be slain by you; but kill us, O\nMadhava! on a solid earth, free from any water; and thus keep your word.\n\n\n\nS\xc2\x92ri Bhagavan Hari laughed and remembering His Sudarsan disc said :-- \xc2\x93O two\nhighly fortunate ones! Verily, I will kill both of you on the vast solid spot\nwithout any trace of water. Thus saying, the Devadeva Hari expanded His own\nthighs and showed to those Danavas the vast solid earth on the surface of\nwater and said :--\n\n\n\n\xc2\x93O two Danavas! See, here is no water. Place your two heads here; thus I will\nkeep my word and you would keep your word.\xc2\x94 Hearing this, Madhu Kai _t_ abha\nthought over in their minds and expanded their bodies to ten thousand Yojanas.\nBhagavan Vi _sn_ u Hari also extended his thighs to twice that amount. Seeing\nthis, they were greatly, suprised and laid their heads on the thighs of Vi\n_sn_ u. Vi _sn_ u of wonderful prowess, then cut off quickly with His Sudarsan\ndisc the two very big heads over His thighs. Thus the two Danavas Madhu Kai\n_t_ abha passed away; and the marrow (meda) of them filled the ocean. O Munis!\nFor this reason, this earth is named Medini and the earth is unfit for eatable\npurpose.\n\n\n\nThus I have described to you all that you asked. The sum and substance is this\nthat the wise persons should serve Mahamaya with all thei hearts. The Supreme\nS\xc2\x92akti is worshipped by all the Devas. Verily verily, I say unto you that this\nis decided, in all the Vedas and other S\xc2\x92astras that there is nothing higher\nthan this \xc3\x82dya S\xc2\x92akti. Therefore this Supreme S\xc2\x92akti should be worshipped\nanyhow; either in Her Sagu _n_ a form or in Her Nirgu _n_ a state.\n\n\n\nThus ends the ninth Chapter of the first Skandha on the killing of Madhu Kai\n_t_ abha in the Mahapurana S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar\n_s_ i Veda Vyas.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 10](bk01ch10.htm)\n\n"
