Of that same (clay) she (the queen) forms the first, the\n'invincible' (brick); for the invincible one (Asha _dh_ a) is this earth, and\nthis earth was created first of these worlds. She forms it of that same clay,\nfor this earth is (one) of these worlds. The (Sacrificer's) consecrated\nconsort (mahishi) forms it: for this earth is a 'mahishi' (female buffalo, a\ncow). She who is first taken to wife is the consecrated consort.\n\np. 239\n\n6:5:3:22\\. It measures a foot (in length and breadth), for the foot is a\nfoundation, and this earth also is a foundation. It is marked with three\nlines, for this earth is threefold 1.\n\n6:5:3:33\\. Now he (the Sacrificer) makes the fire-pan: he thereby makes these\nworlds. He then makes the (three) 'all-light' (bricks), that is these deities,\nAgni, Vayu, \xc3\x82ditya, for those deities indeed are all the light. He makes them\nfrom that same clay (as the fire-pan): he thus produces these gods from these\nworlds. The Sacrificer makes them. They are marked with three lines, for\nthreefold are these gods 2. Thus as regards the deities.\n\n6:5:3:44\\. Now as regards the self (or body): the fire-pan, indeed, is the\nself (of Agni). The 'invincible' (brick) is speech: that she (the wife) makes\nfirst, for this speech is foremost in the body. She makes it from that same\nclay, for this speech is of the body. The (Sacrificer's) consecrated consort\nmakes it, for speech is a 'mahishi.' It is marked with three lines, for speech\nis divided into three kinds, _Ri_ k-verses, Ya _g_ us-formulas, and Saman-\ntunes; and because of this threefold form of speech, low-voiced, half-loud,\nand loud.\n\n6:5:3:55\\. He makes the fire-pan: thereby he makes (Agni's) self. He then\nmakes the 'all-light' (bricks),--the 'all-light' (brick) is offspring, for\noffspring indeed is all the light: he thus causes generation to take place. He\nmakes them of the same clay (as the fire-pan): he thus produces offspring from\nthe self. The Sacrificer makes them: the Sacrificer thus\n\np. 240\n\nproduces offspring from his own self. He makes them without interruption: he\nthus produces uninterrupted offspring from his own self. He makes them\nsubsequently (to the fire-pan): he thus produces the offspring subsequently to\nhis own self. They are marked with three lines, for generation is threefold,\nfather, mother, and son; or, the embryo, and the inner and outer membrane.\n\n6:5:3:66\\. He makes these from (clay) prepared with prayer, the others from\n(clay) prepared without prayer; for these are defined, the others undefined;\nthese are limited (in number), the others unlimited.\n\n6:5:3:77\\. That Agni is Pra _g_ apati; but Pra _g_ apati is both of this,\ndefined and undefined, limited and unlimited: thus when he makes (bricks) from\n(clay) prepared with prayer, he thereby makes up that form of his (Pra _g_\napati's) which is defined and limited; and when he makes them from (clay)\nprepared without prayer, he thereby makes up that form of his which is\nundefined and unlimited. Verily, then, whosoever knowing this does it on this\nwise, makes up the whole and complete Agni. From the (clay) lying ready\nprepared, he leaves over a lump for expiations 1.\n\n6:5:3:88\\. He (the Adhvaryu) now fumigates it (the fire-pan)--just for the\nsake of strength, or to (mark) the progress of the work. And, again, as to why\nhe fumigates,--that fire-pan is the head of the sacrifice, and the smoke its\nbreath: he thus puts breath into the head.\n\n6:5:3:99\\. He fumigates it with horse-dung, to insure it against injury; for\nthe horse is sacred to Pra _g_ apati,\n\np. 241\n\nand Pra _g_ apati is Agni, and one does not injure one's own self. And with\ndung (he does it) because that is what was eaten (by the horse) and is\nuseless; and thus he does not injure the horse itself, nor the other cattle.\n\n6:5:3:1010\\. [Va _g_. S. XI, 60] 'May the Vasus make thee fragrant by the\nGayatri measure, A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like!--May the Rudras make thee fragrant by the Trish\n_t_ ubh metre, A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like!--May the \xc3\x82dityas make thee fragrant by the _G_\nagati metre, A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like!--May the All-gods, the friends of all men, make\nthee fragrant by the Anush _t_ ubh metre, A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like!--May Indra make thee\nfragrant!--May Varu _n_ a make thee fragrant!--May Vish _n_ u make thee\nfragrant!'--he thus fumigates it by means of the deities.\n\n6:5:3:1111\\. Seven balls of horse-dung are (used), and seven formulas: those\ndeities are sevenfold 1, and seven vital airs there are in the head. But also\nwhat is many times, seven times seven, is (expressed by) seven 2: he thus puts\nthe seven vital airs into the head.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[239:1](sbe4143.htm#fr_472) See [VI, 1, 1, 14](sbe4128.htm#6:1:1:14).\n\n[239:2](sbe4143.htm#fr_473) Viz. those of the sky, the air, and the earth.
