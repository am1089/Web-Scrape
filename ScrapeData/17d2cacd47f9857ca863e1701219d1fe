As nearly all\nthe writers of the Pur\xc4\x81nas seem to regard it a duty to describe\n\np. 99\n\nthe work of creation as performed by this god, and as each account differs in\ndetail from the others, it is a perfectly hopeless task to attempt to give a\nharmonized statement of this great event. I shall therefore give Manu\'s *\naccount of it, which is largely founded upon the teaching of the Vedas, though\nconsiderably mixed up with more modern views.\n\n"This universe was enveloped in darkness--unperceived, undistinguishable,\nundiscoverable, unknowable, as it were, entirely sunk in sleep. The\nirresistible self-existent lord, undiscerned, creating this universe with the\nfive elements, and all other things, was manifested dispelling the gloom. He\nwho is beyond the cognizance of the senses, subtile, undiscernible, eternal,\nwho is the essence of all things, and inconceivable, himself shone forth. He,\ndesiring, seeking to produce various creatures from his own body, first\ncreated the waters, and deposited in them a seed. This (seed) became a golden\negg, resplendent as the sun, in which he himself was born as Brahm\xc4\x81, the\nprogenitor of all worlds. The waters are called _n \xc4\x81r\xc4\x81h_, because they are the\noffspring of Nara; and since they were formerly the place of his movement (\n_ayana_ ), he is therefore called N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81yana. \xe2\x80\xa0 Being formed by that First\nCause, undiscernible, eternal, which is both existent and non-existent, that\nmale is\n\np. 100\n\nknown in the world as Brahm\xc4\x81. That lord having continued a year in the egg,\ndivided it into two parts by his mere thought." * In the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata, and some\nof the Pur\xc4\x81nas, Brahm\xc4\x81 is said to have issued from a lotus that sprang from\nthe navel of Vishnu.\n\nThe egg referred to above is thus described in the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na" \xe2\x80\xa0:--"Its\nwomb, vast as the mountain Meru, was composed of the mountains, and the mighty\noceans were the waters which filled its cavity. In that egg were the\ncontinents, seas, and mountains; the planets and divisions of the universe;\nthe gods, the demons and mankind. Brahm\xc4\x81 is said to be born; a familiar phrase\nto signify his manifestation." This wonderful egg, after the Creator had\ninhabited it for a thousand years, burst open, and Brahm\xc4\x81 issuing forth by\nmeditation commenced the work of creation. Seeing that the earth was sunk\nbeneath the waters, he assumed the form of a boar, \xe2\x80\xa1 and, diving, raised it\nupon his tusks. After this, he continued the work of creation.\n\nIn pictures Brahm\xc4\x81 is represented as a red man with four heads, though in the\nPur\xc4\x81nas he is said to have had originally five. He is dressed in white\nraiment, and rides upon a goose. In one hand he carries a staff, in the other\na dish for receiving alms. A legend in the "Matsya Pur\xc4\x81na" \xc2\xa7 gives the\nfollowing account of the formation of his numerous heads:--"Brahm\xc4\x81 formed from\nhis own immaculate substance a female who is celebrated under the names of\nSatarup\xc4\x81, Savitri, Sarasvati, G\xc4\x81yatri, and Br\xc4\x81hmani. Beholding his daughter,\nborn from his body, Brahm\xc4\x81 became wounded with the\n\np. 101\n\narrows of love, and exclaimed, How surpassingly lovely she is!\' Satarup\xc4\x81\nturned to the right side from his gaze; but as Brahm\xc4\x81 wished to look after\nher, a second head issued from his body. As she passed to the left, and behind\nhim, to avoid his amorous glances, two other heads successively appeared. At\nlength she sprang into the sky; and as Brahm\xc4\x81 was anxious to gaze after her\nthere, a fifth head was immediately formed. Brahm\xc4\x81 then said to his daughter,\n\'Let us produce all kinds of animated beings, men, suras (gods), and asuras\n(demons). Hearing this, she descended, and Brahm\xc4\x81 having espoused her, they\nwithdrew to a secluded spot where they dwelt together for one hundred divine\nyears; * at the expiration of which time was born Manu, who is also called\nSwayambhuva and Vir\xc4\x81j." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nThe following legend \xe2\x80\xa1 occurs, with some variations, in several Pur\xc4\x81nas,\nshowing why Brahm\xc4\x81 was deprived of his fifth head:--\n\n"Once when they were assembled on the top of Meru, the holy sages, having\nsaluted Brahm\xc4\x81, requested him to declare the true nature of the godhead; but\nthe Creator, influenced by the delusion of Mahesha (a demon), and his mind\nobscured by spiritual darkness, asserted his own pre-eminence, and said: \'I am\nthe womb of the universe, without beginning or end, and the sole and self-\nexistent lord; and he who does not worship me\n\np. 102\n\nshall never obtain beatitude.\' On hearing this, Kratu, a form of N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81yana\n(Vishnu), smiled and said: \' Hadst thou not been misled by ignorance, thou\nwouldst not have made an assertion so contrary to truth; for I am the framer\nof the universe, the source of life, the unborn, eternal and supreme N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81yana;\nand, had I not willed it, creation would not have taken place.\'\n\n"Thus Vishnu and Brahm\xc4\x81 disputed, and at length they agreed to allow the\nmatter to be decided by the Vedas. The Vedas declared that Siva was creator,\npreserver, destroyer. Having heard these words, Vishnu and Brahm\xc4\x81, still\nbewildered by the darkness of delusion, said, \'How can the lord of goblins,\nthe delighter in graveyards, the naked devotee covered with ashes, haggard in\nappearance, wearing twisted locks ornamented with snakes, be the supreme\nbeing? \' The incorporeal Pr\xc4\x81na (Life), then assuming a form, said, \'This is\nnot the real form of Siva; but when united to his energy, he sometimes, under\nthe figure of Rudra, delights himself in various illusive sports.\' But even\nthese words dispelled not the spiritual darkness of Vishnu and Brahm\xc4\x81; when\nsuddenly appeared between them a wondrous effulgence filling the heavens,\nearth, and mid-air. In the midst of this they beheld a human form, vast,\nuncreated, of a dark hue, holding in his hand a trident and a rosary, and\nwearing a serpent for a Br\xc4\x81hmanical thread. On seeing whom, the fifth head of\nBrahm\xc4\x81 glowed with anger and said, \'I know thee well, O Chandra Shekera, for\nfrom my forehead didst thou spring, and because thou didst weep I called thee\nRudra. Hasten then to seek the refuge of my feet, and I will protect thee, O\nmy son! \' At these proud words of Brahm\xc4\x81, Siva was incensed; and from his\nanger sprang into existence a terrific form (Bhairava), whom he thus\naddressed:\n\np. 103\n\n[paragraph continues] \'Chastise this lotus-born!\' No sooner did Bhairava\nreceive this order, than instantly he cut off the head of Brahm\xc4\x81 with the\nthumb of his left hand. That member which had committed the fault received\npunishment; and therefore Brahm\xc4\x81 was deprived of his fifth head." Upon this\nVishnu and Brahm\xc4\x81 praised Siva.\n\nIn another part of the same Pur\xc4\x81na * is another legend, giving a somewhat\ndifferent account of this circumstance:--\n\n"Formerly all things movable and immovable having been destroyed, nought\nremained but one boundless ocean; nor fire, nor air, nor sun, nor atmosphere,\nnor stars, nor planets, nor light, nor earth, nor heaven, nor gods nor demons\nexisted then; and all was involved in impenetrable darkness. One being alone,\nMah\xc4\x81 K\xc4\x81la (Siva), pervaded all space; who being desirous of creation, churned\nhis left arm with his right forefinger; whence issued a bubble, which\nincreasing in size became an egg resembling gold. This egg Mah\xc4\x81 K\xc4\x81la divided\nwith his hand; of the upper part he formed the heavens, and of the lower half\nthe earth, and in the centre of it appeared Brahm\xc4\x81 with five hands and four\narms, to whom Mah\xc4\x81 K\xc4\x81la thus said, \'Through my favour effect creation.\' Having\nthus spoken, he disappeared.\n\n"Brahm\xc4\x81 having then considered in what manner he could accomplish this object,\npropitiated his lord Bhava with a severe _tapas_ (meditation), and in\nconsequence received from him the four Vedas, and was thus enabled to become\nthe Creator. But as Siva had not revealed himself, Brahm\xc4\x81 continued his\nmeditation in order that he might behold that god. Siva was propitiated; but,\nstill invisible, thus said, \'O Brahm\xc4\x81, choose whatever boon thou choosest!\'\nBrahm\xc4\x81 craved that Siva would\n\np. 104\n\nbecome his son. Siva replied: \'Propitiated by thy piety, I will become thy son\nunder the form of Rudra; but as thou hast craved a boon which ought not to\nhave been asked, I shall on this account hereafter cut off one of thy heads.\nNevertheless, though thou shalt afterwards possess but four heads, yet as thou\nhast been formed by me, from my own substance which is that Brahm\xc4\x81, thou shalt\nin remembrance of this circumstance be denominated Brahm\xc4\x81. Also from my\nbecoming thy son, shalt thou be called Pit\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81ha (the great father).\'\n\n"Brahm\xc4\x81 having obtained both a boon and a curse, proceeded, in order to effect\ncreation, to sacrifice to that fire which had sprung from his own effulgence;\nand from the heat, perspiration collected on his forehead. In wiping this off\nwith a small piece of wood, a drop of blood fell into the fire, from which by\nthe will of Siva sprang Rudra, of a dark hue, with five heads, ten hands, and\nfifteen eyes; having a serpent for his Br\xc4\x81hmanical thread, wearing twisted\nlocks, and the moon on his head, and clothed in the skin of a lion. Having\nseen such a son, Brahm\xc4\x81 was delighted, and bestowed on him various\nappellations. Brahm\xc4\x81 having created various classes of beings, they all adored\nhim, except Rudra; to whom Brahm\xc4\x81 said, \'Why dost thou not also adore me?\'\nRudra replied, \'I worship none other than that effulgence from which I sprang!\n\' Having thus spoken, he departed to Siva\'s abode. But Brahm\xc4\x81 from the\nimpurity of his nature became immersed in spiritual darkness, and thought that\nit was by his own power alone that he had effected creation, and there was no\nother god equal to him. His fifth head also having read the Vedas, which the\nother four heads had delivered, acquired a splendour which neither suras\n(gods) nor asuras (demons) could endure."\n\np. 105\n\nThe "Padma Pur\xc4\x81na" * thus concludes this story: "Unable therefore to approach\nor behold it, they determined to apply to Siva for relief. Being propitiated\nby them, Siva granted their request, and proceeded with them to where Brahm\xc4\x81\nremained inflated with pride. On seeing Siva, Brahm\xc4\x81 did not pay him the\ncustomary honours. Siva, seeing Brahm\xc4\x81\'s fifth head inflicting distress on the\nuniverse by its effulgent beams, brighter than a thousand suns, approached him\nand said, \'Oh! this head shines with too much splendour,\' and immediately cut\nit off with the nail of his left thumb, with as much ease as a man cuts off\nthe stem of a plantain tree."\n\nThe Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata says that Siva did not actually cut off Brahm\xc4\x81\'s head on this\noccasion, but was only prevented from doing so through the intercession of the\ngods. It was because of his attempting to seduce his own daughter that Siva\ndecapitated him. This crime was attempted when in a fit of intoxication; hence\nBrahm\xc4\x81 pronounced a curse upon the gods who should hereafter drink spirits.\n\nIn the passages just quoted, Brahm\xc4\x81 is represented as worshipping Siva for his\nown personal benefit; in the Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na," \xe2\x80\xa0 he is described as joining with\ngods and men in the worship of this same deity, and as officiating as priest\non that occasion. And in another part of the Pur\xc4\x81na \xe2\x80\xa1 is the following hymn\naddressed to Vishnu by Brahm\xc4\x81:--"Thou art the common centre of all, the\nprotector of the world, and all things exist in thee. All that has been, or\nwill be, thou art. There is nothing else but thee, O lord; nothing else has\nbeen, or will be. Thou art independent, and without beginning." The object of\nthis laudation was to induce\n\np. 106\n\n[paragraph continues] Vishnu to save the earth from its load of sorrow; in\nanswer to it, Vishnu appeared here as Krishna.\n\nAt the present time Brahm\xc4\x81 is not largely worshipped by the Hindus. "The\nBr\xc4\x81hmans in their morning and evening worship repeat an incantation containing\na description of the image of Brahm\xc4\x81; at noon they present to him a single\nflower; at the time of burnt-offering, _gh \xc4\xab_ is presented to him. In the\nmonth of M\xc4\x81gh, at the full moon, an earthen image of him is worshipped, with\nthat of Siva on his right hand, and Vishnu on his left." * Brahm\xc4\x81 as Creator\nis supposed to have finished his work; hence, excepting in one place, viz. at\nPushkara in \xc4\x80jmir, there is no temple to him now existing. It is evident that\nfor centuries the worship of Brahm\xc4\x81 has not been common, for in the "Skanda\nPur\xc4\x81na " \xe2\x80\xa0 is an indelicate legend, in which the charge of falsehood is proved\nagainst him, and this fact is given to account for the fact that his worship\nhad ceased. It concludes as follows:--"Since thou hast childishly and with\nweak understanding asserted a falsehood, let no one henceforth perform worship\nto thee."\n\nThe Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata says that Brahm\xc4\x81\'s heaven is eight hundred miles long, four\nhundred wide, and forty high. N\xc4\x81rada declared himself incompetent to describe\nit. In two hundred years he could not mention all its excellences. He said\nthat it contained in a superior degree all the excellences of the other\nheavens; and that whatever existed in the creation of Brahm\xc4\x81\' on earth, from\nthe smallest insect to the largest animal, was to be found there.\n\nIn the later mythology, a deity named Dh\xc4\x81t\xc4\x81 (the Creator), who in the Rig-Veda\nhas no very clearly-defined powers, but is there said to operate in the\n\np. 107\n\nproduction of life and the preservation of health, is identified with\nPraj\xc4\x81pati, or Brahm\xc4\x81; and in the sense of "maker " the term is also applied to\nVishnu and Krishna. Sometimes he is said to be a son of Brahm\xc4\x81. *\n\nIn addition to the names of Brahm\xc4\x81 already referred to, the following are\nthose most commonly known:--\n\n\xc4\x80tmabhu, "The self-existent."\n\nParamesthi, "The chief sacrificer." He as the first Br\xc4\x81hman performed all the\ngreat sacrifices of the Hindu religion.\n\nLokesha, "The god of the world."\n\nHiranyagarbha, "He who came from the golden egg."\n\nSavitripati, "The husband of Savitri."\n\nAdikavi, The first poet."\n\n##### SARASVATI.\n\nBrahm\xc4\x81\'s wife is Sarasvati, the goddess of wisdom and science, the mother of\nthe Vedas, and the inventor of the Devanagari letters. She is represented as a\nfair young woman, with four arms. With one of her right hands she is\npresenting a flower to her husband, by whose side she continually stands; and\nin the other she holds a book of palm-leaves, indicating that she is fond of\nlearning. In one of her left hands she has a string of pearls, called Sivam\xc4\x81la\n(Siva\'s garland), which serves as a rosary; and in the other is a _damaru_ ,\nor small drum. At other times she is represented with two arms only, seated on\na lotus, playing a kind of banjo. She dwells on earth amongst men, but her\nspecial abode is with her husband in Brahm\xc4\x81loka.\n\nSarasvati having been produced from Brahm\xc4\x81, was regarded as his daughter;\nhence her union with him\n\np. 108\n\nwas said to be criminal by the other gods. Sometimes she is called the wife of\nVishnu, but this difficulty is explained by a legend. * "Sarasvati, by the\nstandard mythological authorities, is the wife of Brahm\xc4\x81. The Vaishnavas of\nBengal have a popular legend that she was the wife of Vishnu, as were also\nLakshmi and Gang\xc4\x81. The ladies disagreed, Sarasvati, like the other\n\n[![SARASVATI.](tn/10800.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/10800.jpg)  \nSARASVATI.  \n\ntype of learned ladies, Minerva, being something of a termagant; and Vishnu,\nfinding that one wife was as much as even a god could manage, transferred\nSarasvati to Brahm\xc4\x81 and Gang\xc4\x81 to Siva, and contented himself with Lakshmi\nalone.\n\n"Sarasvati is a goddess of some, though not of very great, importance in the\nVedas. . . . She is celebrated\n\np. 109\n\nboth as a river and a goddess. She was primarily a river deity, as her name,\n\'the watery,\' clearly denotes; and in this capacity she is celebrated in a few\nseparate passages. Allusion is made in the hymns, as well as in the Br\xc4\x81hmanas,\nto sacrifices being performed on the banks of this river, and of the adjoining\nDrishadvati; and the Sarasvati in particular seems to have been associated\nwith the reputation for sanctity which . . . was ascribed to the whole region\ncalled Brahm\xc4\x81vartta, lying between these two small streams, and situated\nimmediately to the westward of the Jumn\xc4\x81. The Sarasvati thus appears to have\nbeen to the early Indians what the Ganges (which is only twice named in the\nRig-Veda) is to their descendants. . . . When once the river had acquired a\ndivine character, it was quite natural that she should be regarded as the\npatroness of ceremonies which were celebrated on the margin of her holy\nwaters, and that her direction and blessing should be invoked as essential to\ntheir proper performance and success. The connection into which she was thus\nbrought with sacred rites may have led to the further step of imagining her to\nhave an influence on the composition of the hymns which formed so important a\npart of the proceedings, and of identifying her with V\xc4\x81ch, the goddess of\nspeech. At least I have no other explanation to offer to this double character\nand identification. *\n\n"Sarasvati is frequently invited to the sacrifices along with several other\ngoddesses, who, however, were never, like her, river nymphs, but\npersonifications of some department of religious worship, or sacred science.\nShe is frequently invoked along with other deities.\n\n"In many passages where she is celebrated, her original character is, as I\nhave intimated, distinctly\n\np. 110\n\npreserved. Thus in two places she is mentioned along with rivers, or\nfertilizing waters: \'Ye opulent waters, command riches; ye possess excellent\npower and immortality; ye are mistresses of wealth and progeny; may Sarasvati\nbestow this vitality on her worshipper.\' And she is mentioned with the other\nwell-known streams which are there named, the Sindhu, the Ganges, &c. In\nanother place she is said to \'surpass all other rivers, and to flow pure from\nthe mountains to the sea.\' In other verses she is called upon to \'descend from\nthe sky, from the great mountain, to the sacrifice;\' and is supplicated to\ncombine with the spouses of the other gods to afford secure protection to the\nworshippers. . . . It is difficult to say whether in any of the passages in\nwhich Sarasvati is invoked, even in those where she appears as the patroness\nof holy rites, her character as a river goddess is entirely left out of sight.\n. . .\n\n"In the later mythology, as is well known, Sarasvati was identified with V\xc4\x81ch,\nand became under various names the spouse of Brahm\xc4\x81, and the goddess of wisdom\nand eloquence, and is invoked as a Muse. In the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata she is called the\nmother of the Vedas, and the same is said of V\xc4\x81ch in the Taittariya Br\xc4\x81hmana\nwhere she is said to be the wife of Indra, to contain within herself all\nworlds, and to have been sought after by the Rishis who composed the Vedic\nhymns, as well as by the gods through austerity." *\n\nIn the Pur\xc4\x81nas, Sarasvati is spoken of under other titles. A verse in the\n"Matsya Pur\xc4\x81na" gives authority for the belief that one goddess only is\nintended, though she is called by several names: "Brahm\xc4\x81 next formed from his\nown immaculate substance a female, who is celebrated under the names of\nSatarup\xc4\x81, Savitri,\n\np. 111\n\n[paragraph continues] Sarasvati, G\xc4\x81yatri, and Br\xc4\x81hmani." In the following\nlegend from the "Skanda Pur\xc4\x81na," * though by Savitri Sarasvati is intended,\nG\xc4\x81yatri represents some other person who became a _second_ wife of Brahm\xc4\x81.\nIswara (Siva) is addressing Devi (Parvati):--\n\n"Listen, O Devi, and I will tell you how Savitri forsook Brahm\xc4\x81, and he in\nconsequence espoused G\xc4\x81yatri. The Vedas have declared the great advantages\nwhich are derived from sacrifice, by which the gods are delighted, and\ntherefore bestow rain upon the earth. . . . To secure therefore the verdure\nand vitality of the three worlds, I perform sacrifices; and, in imitation of\nme, sacrifices are performed by gods and men. For the same purpose Brahm\xc4\x81 and\nhis wife Savitri, the immortals, and the holy sages repaired to Pushkara; but\nwhen all the preparations had been made, with all due rites and ceremonies,\nfor performing the sacrifices, Savitri, detained by some household affairs,\nwas not in attendance. A priest accordingly went to call her; but she replied,\nI have not yet completed my dress, nor arranged several affairs. Lakshmi, and\nBhav\xc4\x81ni, and Gang\xc4\x81, and Sv\xc4\x81ha, and Indr\xc4\x81ni, and the wives of the other gods\nand of the holy sages, have not yet arrived, and how therefore can I enter the\nassembly alone?\'\n\n"The priest returned, and thus addressed Brahm\xc4\x81: \'Savitri is engaged and will\nnot come; but without a wife what advantage can be derived from these rites?\'\nThe god, incensed at the conduct of Savitri, thus spoke to Indra: \'Hasten,\nand, in obedience to my order, bring a wife from wherever you can find one.\'\nIndra proceeded accordingly; and as he passed hastily along, saw a milkmaid,\nyoung, beautiful, and of a smiling countenance, carrying a jar of butter. He\nseized her and\n\np. 112\n\nbrought her to the assembly, when Brahm\xc4\x81 thus spoke: \'O gods and holy sages,\nif it seem good unto you I will espouse this G\xc4\x81yatri, and she shall become the\nmother of the Vedas, and the cause of purity to these worlds!\' Upon this\nBrahm\xc4\x81 was united to G\xc4\x81yatri, who was led into the bower of the bride, and\nthere arrayed in silken garments, and adorned with the costliest ornaments.\n\n"At this time Savitri, accompanied by the wives of Vishnu, Rudra, and the\nother gods, came to the place of sacrifice. Seeing the milkmaid in the bride\'s\nbower, and the priests engaged in the performance of the sacred rites,\nincensed with anger, she thus addressed Pit\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81ha: \'O Brahm\xc4\x81! hast thou\nconceived so sinful an intention as to reject me, who am thy wedded wife? Hast\nthou no sense of shame, that thus, influenced by love, thou committest so\nreprehensible an act? Thou art called the great father of gods and holy sages,\nand yet thou here publicly actest in a manner which must excite the derision\nof the three worlds. But how can I now show my face; or, deserted by my\nhusband, call myself a wife?\' Brahm\xc4\x81 replied: \'The priests informed me that\nthe time for the sacrifice was passing away, and that it could not profitably\nbe performed unless my wife were present, . . . and Indra having brought\nG\xc4\x81yatri, Vishnu and Rudra gave her in marriage to me. Forgive, therefore, this\none act, and I will never again offend thee!\'\n\n"On hearing these words, Savitri exclaimed, \'By the powers which I have\nobtained by the performance of tapas, may Brahm\xc4\x81 never be worshipped in temple\nor sacred place, except one day in each year. . . . And, Indra, since thou\ndidst bring that milkmaid to Brahm\xc4\x81, thou shalt be bound in chains by thine\nenemies, and confined in a strange country; and thy city and station shall be\noccupied by thine enemies.\' Addressing Vishnu,\n\np. 113\n\nshe said, \'Since thou gayest her in marriage to Brahm\xc4\x81, shalt thou, in\nconsequence of Bhrigu\'s curse, be born amongst men, and shalt endure the agony\nof having thy wife ravished from thee by thine enemy; and long also shalt thou\nwander, the humble keeper of cattle!\' To Rudra she said: \'By the curse of the\nholy sages, shalt thou be deprived of thy manhood!\' To Agni: \'Mayest thou be a\ndevourer of all things, clean and unclean!\' To the priests and Br\xc4\x81hmans:\n\'Henceforth shall ye perform sacrifices solely from the desire of obtaining\nthe usual gifts: and from covetousness alone shall ye attend temples and holy\nplaces; satisfied only shall ye be with the food of others, and dissatisfied\nwith that of your own houses; and in quest of riches shall ye unduly perform\nholy rites and ceremonies! \'\n\n"Having pronounced these curses, Savitri left the assembly, and was\naccompanied for a short distance by Lakshmi and the other goddesses, when they\nall declared their intention of returning. On hearing this, Savitri was\nincensed, and thus addressed them: \'Since you now forsake me, O Lakshmi!\nmayest thou never remain stationary in one place; * and mayest thou always\nabide with the vile, the inconstant, the contemptible, the sinful, the cruel,\nthe foolish, and the barbarian! And, Indr\xc4\x81ni, when Indra incurs the guilt of\nBr\xc4\x81hmanicide by slaying Tvastri\'s son, then shall Nahusha acquire his kingdom,\nand, desirous of obtaining thee, shall exclaim, "Am I not Indra? why then does\nnot the young and lovely Indr\xc4\x81ni wait upon me? If I do not obtain her, I will\nslay all the gods." Thou on learning his wishes shalt remain in thy house\nimmersed in grief, and borne down by the weight of my curse!\' Savitri then\npronounced this curse on the wives of the gods collectively: \'May\n\np. 114\n\nyou all remain barren; and may you never enjoy the pleasure of having\nchildren!\' Vishnu then tried in vain to appease her."\n\nAfter Savitri\'s angry departure from the assembly, G\xc4\x81yatri modified the curses\nthat had been pronounced. She promised all kinds of blessing, including final\nabsorption into him, to all the worshippers of Brahm\xc4\x81. Though Indra be bound,\nhis son should release him. Though Vishnu lost his wife, he should regain her.\nThough Rudra be deprived of his manhood, the Linga as his representative\nshould be universally worshipped. Though men made gifts to the Br\xc4\x81hmans, it\nwould be because they reverenced them as gods. And though the goddesses could\nnot have children of their own, this would not cause them regret.\n\nThe "Padma Pur\xc4\x81na" gives a happier termination to the story. Vishnu and\nLakshmi, at Brahm\xc4\x81\'s request, followed Savitri when she left the assembly, and\ninduced her to return. On re-entering, Brahm\xc4\x81 asked what she wished him to do\nwith G\xc4\x81yatri. Savitri was too bashful to speak; whereupon G\xc4\x81yatri threw\nherself at her feet. Savitri raised her, and embracing her said: "A wife ought\nto obey the wishes and orders of her husband; for that wife who reproaches her\nhusband, who is complaining and quarrelsome, and instead of being his life,\ndeprives him by her conduct of length of years, shall, when she dies, most\nassuredly go to hell. Considering this, the virtuous wife will do nothing\ndispleasing to her husband; therefore let us both be attached to Brahm\xc4\x81." "So\nbe it," said G\xc4\x81yatri; "thy orders will I always obey, and esteem thy\nfriendship precious as my life. Thy daughter am I, O goddess! Deign to protect\nme!" It would appear that between the time when the "Matsya Pur\xc4\x81na" was\ncomposed and the date of the Padma,\n\np. 115\n\nconsiderable change had come in the character of the ideal woman. Or it may be\nthat the writer of the Padma wished to give a better ideal to the wives of his\nday.\n\nIn a legend in the "Var\xc4\x81ha Pur\xc4\x81na," Sarasvati is addressed as G\xc4\x81yatri,\nSarasvati, Maheshvari (one of the names of Parvati), and also Savitri. Her\nmost common name is Sarasvati, by which name, as the goddess of learning, she\nis regularly worshipped once a year.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[99:*](hmvp17.htm#fr_100) "Dharma Shastra," chaps. i.--v.\n\n[99:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp17.htm#fr_101) According to the "Brahm\xc4\x81 Pur\xc4\x81na," another name,\n\xc4\x80pava (who sports on the waters), is given Brahm\xc4\x81, which has a similar, though\nnot identical, application with N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81yana. \xc4\x80pava, according to that Pur\xc4\x81na,\ndivided himself into two parts, male and female, from whom proceeded Vishnu,\nwho in his turn created Vir\xc4\x81j, who brought the first man into the world.\nWilson says, "According to the commentator on this passage, the first stage\nwas the creation of \xc4\x80pava, or Vishistha, or Vir\xc4\x81j by Vishnu, through the\nagency of Brahm\xc4\x81; and the next was the creation of Manu by Vir\xc4\x81j."--Dowson,\n_s.v._ "Apave."\n\n[100:*](hmvp17.htm#fr_102) Muir, O.
