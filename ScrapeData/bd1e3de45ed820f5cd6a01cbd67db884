And some (state the soul to be) the shaper; and sons, and so on.\n\nAnd the followers of one _s_ akha state in their text that the dreaming soul\nis the shaper of its desires: 'He, the person who is awake in those who sleep,\nshaping one desired thing (kama) after the other.' The term 'kama' there\ndenotes not mere desires, but such things as sons and the like which are\nobjects of desire. For sons and so on are introduced as 'kamas' in previous\npassages: 'Ask for all kamas according to thy wish'; 'Choose sons and\ngrandsons living a hundred years' (Ka. Up. I, 1, 25; 23). The individual soul\nthus creates chariots, and so on, in its dreams. That the soul has the power\nof realising all its\n\np. 602\n\nwishes is known from the declaration of Pra _g_ apati. It is therefore able to\ncreate, even in the absence of special instruments.--This view is set aside by\nthe next Sutra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 3.
