D. Barnett, [1911], at sacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\n#### III. The World Within 1\n\n"Now within this town of Brahma 2 is a dwelling, a little lotus-flower; within\nthis is a little space; what is therewithin men should inquire after, yea,\nshould seek to know."\n\nIf they should say to him: "Within this town of Brahma is a dwelling, a little\nlotus-flower; within this is a little space; what is found there-within which\nmen should inquire after, yea, should seek to know?"--\n\nhe shall say: "Verily that space within the heart is as great as this Space;\ntherein are lodged both heaven and earth, both fire and wind, both sun and\nmoon, lightning and stars, what one hath here and what he hath not, all this\nis lodged therein."\n\nIf they should say to him: "If all this is lodged in this town of Brahma, and\nall beings and all\n\np. 62\n\ndesires--what remains thereof when old age comes upon it, or it dissolves?"--\n\nhe shall say: "This grows not old with his aging, nor is it smitten by slaying\nof him. This is the true town of Brahma. In it are lodged the Desires. 1 It is\nthe Self, free from evil, ageless, deathless, sorrowless, hungerless,\nthirstless, real of desire, real of purpose\xe2\x80\xa6So they who depart without finding\nhere the Self and these real Desires, walk not as they list in any worlds; but\nthey who depart after finding here the Self and these real Desires, walk as\nthey list in all worlds\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nThese real Desires are covered over by Untruth; real as they are, Untruth is\ntheir covering. Man here can see no more any of his folk who depart hence. But\nwhen he goes _there_  2 he finds all--those of his folk who are living, and\nthose who have departed, and whatever else he wins not for seeking. For there\nthose real Desires are that were covered over by Untruth. It is as with men\nwho, knowing not the ground, should walk again and again over a hidden\ntreasure and find it not; even so all creatures,\n\np. 63\n\ncoming to it day by day, find not this Brahma-world, for they are cast back by\nUntruth [1](brk32.htm#fn_17)\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nNow that perfect Peace, rising up from this body, enters into the Supreme\nLight and issues forth in its own semblance. This is the Self," said he, "this\nis the deathless, the fearless; this is Brahma\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nNow the Self is the dyke holding asunder the worlds that they fall not one\ninto another. Over this dyke pass not day and night, nor old age, nor death,\nnor sorrow, nor good deeds, nor bad deeds. All ills turn away thence; for this\nBrahma-world is void of ill. Therefore in sooth the blind, after passing over\nthis dyke is no more blind, the wounded no more wounded, the sick no more\nsick. Therefore in sooth even Night after passing over this dyke issues forth\nas Day; for in this Brahma-world is everlasting light"\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[61:1](brk31.htm#fr_13) Chh\xc4\x81ndogya Upanishad, viii. 1 f.\n\n[61:2](brk31.htm#fr_14) The body, whose organs of sense are compared to gates;\nthe king within is the soul, or Self; the lotus the heart.\n\n[62:1](brk31.htm#fr_15) Namely, the knowledge and will of the absolute subject\nof thought, or true Self.
