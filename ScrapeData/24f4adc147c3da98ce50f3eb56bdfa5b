If merit and wealth are not (obtained by teaching), nor (at least) the due\nobedience, one should die with one's learning; one should not sow it on barren\nsoil. 1\n\np. 156\n\n2\\. As fire consumes dry grass, even so the Veda, asked for, (but) not\nhonoured, (destroys the enquirer). Therefore let him not proclaim the Veda to\nthose who do not show him honour according to their ability. 2\n\n3\\. They proclaim to him a command to the following effect; 3\n\n4\\. 'Brahman, forsooth, made the created beings over to Death. The student\nalone it did not make over to him.' He (Death) spake, 'Let me have a share in\nhim.' (Brahman answered), 'That night in which he may neglect to offer a piece\nof sacred fuel (shall belong to thee),' 4\n\n5\\. 'Therefore a student who passes a night without offering a piece of sacred\nfuel, cuts it off from the length of his life, Therefore let the student offer\na piece of sacred fuel, lest he spend a night, shortening his life.'\n\n6\\. 'A long sacrificial session begins he who commences his studentship. That\n(night) in which, after being initiated, he (first) offers a piece of sacred\nfuel corresponds to the Praya _n_ iya (Atiratra of a sacrificial session);\nthat night in which (he offers it last), intending to take the final bath,\ncorresponds to the Udayaniya (Atiratra), Those nights which (lie) between\n(these two terms correspond) just to the nights of his sacrificial session.' 6\n\np. 157\n\n7\\. 'A Brahma _n_ a who becomes a student of the Veda, enters existent beings\nin a fourfold manner, (viz.) with one quarter (he enters) Fire, with one\nquarter Death, with one quarter the Teacher, the fourth quarter remains in the\nSoul. When he offers to Fire a piece of sacred fuel, he thereby buys back even\nthat quarter which (resides) in Fire, hallowing it, he places it in himself;\nthat enters into him. Now when making himself poor and, becoming shameless, he\nasks for alms (and) lives as a student of the Veda, he thereby buys back the\nquarter which (resides) in Death; hallowing it, he places it in himself; that\nenters into him. Now when he obeys the orders of his Teacher, he thereby buys\nback that quarter which (resides) in the Teacher; hallowing it, he places it\nin himself; that enters into him. [Now when he recites the Veda, he thereby\nbuys back the quarter which resides in the Soul. Hallowing it, he places it in\nhimself; that enters into him.] Let him not go to beg, after he has bathed (on\nfinishing his studentship). . . . If he does not find another woman whom he\ncan ask for alms,, let him beg even from his own teacher's wife or from his\nown mother. The seventh (night) shall not pass without his asking for alms.\n[(He commits) sin if he does not go out to ask for alms and does not place\nfuel on the fire. If he neglects that during seven (days and) nights, he must\nperform the 7\n\np. 158\n\npenance prescribed for one who has broken the vow of studentship.] All the\nVedas come to him who knows that and acts thus.'\n\n8\\. 'As a blazing fire shines, even so shines he who, knowing this, thus\nfulfils the duties of studentship, after he has bathed (on leaving his\nteacher).' Thus speaks the Brahma _n_ a.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[155:1](sbe1437.htm#fr_795) **4**. Manu II, 112.\n\n[156:2](sbe1437.htm#fr_796) Vasish _th_ a II, 12.\n\n[156:3](sbe1437.htm#fr_797) 'They, i.e. the Va _g_ asaneyins; to him, i.e. to\nthe student'--Govinda.\n\n[156:4](sbe1437.htm#fr_798) The quotation, which begins here and ends with the\nend of the section, is taken from _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a XI, 2, 6. In the\ntext the word Brahman is a neuter.\n\n[156:6](sbe1437.htm#fr_799) MSS. M. and K., as well as the commentary, read\ndirghasattram p. 157 ha va esha upaiti, while the MSS. from the Dekhan and Gu\n_g_ arat, like the printed edition of the Sat. Br., omit the particle 'ha.'\nPraya _n_ iya means, literally, 'initial,' and udayaniya, 'final.' Each sattra\nor sacrificial session begins and ends with an Atiratra sacrifice.\n\n[157:7](sbe1437.htm#fr_800) This portion of the quotation shows, besides some\nminor deviations from the published text of the Madhyandinas, several p. 158\ninterpolations and corruptions. The minor discrepancies are, 'brahma _n_ o vai\nbrahma _k_ aryam upayan' (upaya _k_ _kh_ an, C. I. and T.); padatmanyeva _k_\naturtha _h_ pada _h_ ; yadagnaye samidham adadhati; atha yad atmana _m_\ndaridrik _ri_ tyahrir bhutva bhikshate brahma _k_ arya _m_ _k_ arati; atha yad\na _k_ aryava _k_ a _h_ karoti ya evisya _k_ arye. In the second passage the\nDekhan MSS. read, however, like the printed text. The interpolations are, 'Now\nwhen he recites the Veda,' &c., and the verse, 'He commits sin if he\nneglects,' &c. The former passage entirely destroys the sense of the whole and\nthe connexion of the parts. Both have, however, been retained, as they occur\nin all the MSS. and the two copies of the commentary, and have been enclosed\nin brackets. The corrupt passage is so had that it makes no sense at all. The\nbest MSS. read as follows: 'api hi vai snatva bhiksha _m_ _k_ aratyavi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\nanana _s_ anayaya pitri _n_ amanyabhya _h_ kriyabhya _h_ ' sa yadanyam, &c.,\nD.; 'api ha vai snatva bhish _t_ a _m_ _k_ arasapi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ani na _s_ anaya ya\n[v3. sec. m.] pit _r i_ _n_ am anyabhya _h_ kriyabhya _h_ ,' K.; api ha vai\nsnatva bhiksha _m_ _k_ arati--pa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ati--na _m_ _s_ anayapi pit _ri_ _n_\nam anyabhya _h_ kriyasas, M.; api ha vai snatva bhiksha _m_ _k_ aratyavi _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ atinama _s_ anayapi pit _ri_ _n_ am anyabhya kriyabhya _h_ , C. I. As it\nis by no means certain that Baudhayana's reading agreed with that of the\nprinted text, I have left the passage out.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Adhyaya 3, Ka _n_ _d_ ika 5](sbe1438.htm)\n\n"
