Vyasa said :-- O Janamejaya! When Dhumralochana ceased speaking, the Devi\nKalika made a wild laughter and began to speak sweetly thus :-- O Stupid!\nSkilled in flattery, you know only how to use jugglery of words like an actor;\ndo you think that your ends will be served if you speak only sweet words; this\ncan never be. O Stupid! Fight now; there is no need of useless words. You are\nstrong and have been sent by that wicked Demon with a great army. This Devi,\nout of wrath, will kill you, S\xc2\x92umbha, and Nis\xc2\x92umbha and other commanders by\nHer arrows and will then return to Her abode. Where is that stupid S\xc2\x92umbha?\nAnd where is this Devi, the Great Enchantress of the Universe!\n\n\n\np. 441\n\n\n\nTheir marriage in this world is entirely out of question and can never take\nplace. O Stupid! What do you think that a lioness becoming very passionate,\nwould make an ordinary jackal her husband? or would a she-elephant prefer an\nass? or would a heavenly Cow like a bison? Go to S\xc2\x92umbha and Nis\xc2\x92umbha and\ntell truly to them :-- \xc2\x93Fight or go instantly to Patala.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n8-10. Vyasa said :-- O Fortunate One! The Demon Dhumralochana, hearing thus\nthe Kalika\xc2\x92s words, became very angry and spoke with reddened eyes :-- \xc2\x93O Ugly\nOne! I will slay Thee and this lion infatuated with pride in battle and take\nthis Fair One to the king. O Kali! I have not been able to do this, simply it\nwould break our amorous love sentiments. O Quarrelsome One! Otherwise I would\nhave undoubtedly slain Thee just now with my sharpened arrows tipped with\nirons.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n11\\. Hearing thus, Kalika said :-- O Fool! Why do you boast vainly? this is\nnot the religion of a hero with bows and arrows in their hands. Shoot your\narrows with all your might; I will send you to the realm of Death.\n\n\n\n12-31. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing the Devi\xc2\x92s words, Dhumralochana caught\nhold of his very strong bow and began to shoot arrows after arrows at Kalika.\nIndra and the other Devas came out to see the fight on their best cars in the\ncelestial space and shouted \xc2\x93Victory to the Devi\xc2\x94 and thus eulogised Her. Then\na deadly fight ensued between them with arrows, axes, clubs, S\xc2\x92aktis, and Mu\n_s_ alas and various other weapons. Kalika cut off at the very outset all the\nasses that carried the chariot by Her arrows and next broke his chariot and\nbegan to laugh repeatedly. O Bharata! Then Dhumralochana becoming angry\nmounted on another chariot and began to shoot deadly arrows at Kalika. Kalika\nDevi, too, out off those arrows into pieces before they reached Her and shot\narrows after arrows on the Danava in quick succession. Thousands of his\nsoldiers near to him were killed; the asses and the charioteer were killed and\nthe chariot was broken. She cut off his arrows by Her swift serpent-like\narrows and blew Her conchshell. The Devas seeing this became very glad.\nDhumralochana, seeing himself displaced from his chariot, took up with anger\nhis very strong Parigha weapon and came near to the chariot of the Devi. Then\nthe Danava, terrific like death, began to abuse the Devi and said :-- \xc2\x93O Ugly\ntawny-eyed Kali! I will kill Thee just now.\xc2\x94 Thus saying, he suddenly went\nnear to Her and when he was about to throw his Parigha weapon on Her, the\nAmbika Devi burnt him to ashes simply by Her loud shout (of defiance). Seeing\nDhumralochana burnt to ashes, his soldiers became panic-stricken, and fled\naway immediately, crying aloud \xc2\x93O Father! O Father!\xc2\x94 The Devas saw this and\nand gladly\n\n\n\np. 442\n\n\n\nshowered from high heaps of flowers on the Devi. O King! The battle ground\nthen assumed a dreadful appearance; at some places the slain Danavas; at\nothers, the horses; at other places elephants and at some other places the\nasses lay scattered on the field. The herons, crows, vultures, the Pis\xc2\x92achas\nof the class Ba _t_ abaraphas and jackals and other carnivorous animals, began\nto dance wildly and clamour hideously at the sight of the dead bodies, lying\non the field. The Ambika Devi then quitting the field, went to a distant place\nand blew Her conchshell so furiously and terribly that S\xc2\x92umbha heard that\nterrific noise, while he was sitting in his own residence. At the next moment,\nhe saw that the Danava forces had retreated, and they were coming there\ncrying. Some of them were besmeared with blood all over the bodies; some had\ngot their feet, some their arms, cut asunder, some were devoid of eyes, some\nhad got their backs broken; some had their waists broken; some got their necks\nbroken and some were going on bedsteads. Seeing them thus, S\xc2\x92umbha and\nNis\xc2\x92umbha asked them :-- \xc2\x93Where is Dhumralochana? Why have you all retreated?\nAnd why have you not brought that Lady? Where are the other forces? Who has\nblown this horrible conch-shell? O Fools! Inform me quickly and truly all\nthese things.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n32-33. The soldiers said :-- \xc2\x93O King! Dhumralochana has been slain by Kalika;\nShe has destroyed all the soldiers and has done extraordinary deeds.\xc2\x94 O King!\nKnow the blowing of the conchshell that has caused terror in the hearts of the\nDanavas and has enhanced the joy of the Devas and is being resounded in the\ncelestial space, is that done by the Ambika Devi. (Note: In the Marka _n_ deya\nPura _n_ a, Ambika killed Dhumra.)\n\n\n\n34-45. O Lord! When the Devi broke the chariot of Dhumralochana by the\nmultitude of Her arrows and killed the horses and at last slew Dhumralochana\nhimself, when all the forces were slain by Her who appeared like a lion and\nwhen the rest of the army retreated, the Devas seeing all these were very much\ngladdened and showered flowers from the celestial sky. O King! We have come to\na perfect conclusion that we will not get the victory; now consult with your\nexpert ministers and do what is needful. O King! The Supreme Goddess of the\nUniverse is waiting there alone to fight with you without any help of any\nother forces; this is a great wonder to us. O King! Intoxicated with Her\npower, that Girl, fearless, is reigning there taking Her stand on the lion.\nAll these seem wonderful to us. O King! Consult with your councillors and out\nof the four policies peace, fight, retreat or remaining neutral, accept what\nis best. O Tormentor of the foes! True! There are no forces with the Devi, but\nthe whole host of the Devas will take up Her cause in crisis, there is no\n\n\n\np. 443\n\n\n\ndoubt. In due time, Hari and Hara both will come and assist Her; now the\nguardians of the several quarters, the Lokapalas are waiting by Her side in\nthe celestial space. O Tormentor of the Gods! Know that the Gandarbhas,\nKinnaras, and human beings all will come timely and help Her. O King! We guess\nall these. But that Lady does not want the assistance of anyone nor does She\nexpect that any other body would do the work for Her. You must know this\ncertainly, that She alone can destroy this whole Universe. What to speak of\nthe Danavas only! O Highly Fortunate One! Knowing all these, do as you like.\nIt is the duty of the servants to speak beneficial and at the same time true\nwords with moderation.\n\n\n\n46-51. Vyasa said :-- O King! S\xc2\x92umbha, the tormentor of others, hearing their\nwords asked his younger brother in private :-- \xc2\x93O Brother! This Kalika has\nslain today Dhumralochana with his forces; the few retreated and came over to\nme. Now the Ambika Devi, puffed up with pride is blowing Her conchshell.\nBrother! The ways of Time are knowable even to the wise. The grass becomes a\nthunderbolt and the thunderbolt becomes like a grass and powerless. Know thus\nthe course of Destiny. O Fortunate One! Now I ask you, what are we to do now?\nAre we to entertain yet the desire of enjoying Ambika, or are we to fly away\nfrom here or are we to fight on? Say quickly. Though younger, in times of\ndifficulty, I consider you as my elder.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n52-54. Hearing thus the S\xc2\x92umbha\xc2\x92s words, Nis\xc2\x92umbha said :-- \xc2\x93O Sinless One!\nFlight or taking refuge in a fort is not reasonable. To fight with this Lady\nis the best course. I will take the best generals and soldiers with me and\nwill slay that Lady and quickly return. And if Fate be strong and prove it\notherwise, then, after my death, think out again and again and do what is\nbest.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n55-60. Hearing thus the younger brother\xc2\x92s words, S\xc2\x92umbha said, \xc2\x93You better\nwait; let Cha _nd_ a and Mu _nd_ a go to the battle, surrounded with forces.\nTo kill a hare it is not necessary to send an elephant. This is a very\ntrifling matter; the two great warriors Cha _nd_ a and Mu _nd_ a will be\nfreely able to slay Her.\xc2\x94 Thus saying his younger brother, the King S\xc2\x92umbha\naddressed Cha _nd_ a Mu _nd_ a, who were waiting before him, thus :-- O Cha\n_nd_ a! O Mu _nd_ a! Take your forces and go quickly to kill that shameless\nLady, puffed up with pride. O Pair of Warriors! Kill that tawny-eyed Kalika in\nthe battle and bring that Ambika Devi here quickly. Do this Great Service. And\nif that haughty Ambika be unwilling to come here, though taken as a captive,\nthen kill that Durga, the ornament of the battle, too, by sharp arrows.\n\n\n\np. 444\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-fifth Chapter of the Fifth Book on the killing of\nDhumralochana in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, the Maha Pura _n_ am, of 18,000\nverses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 26](bk05ch26.htm)\n\n'
