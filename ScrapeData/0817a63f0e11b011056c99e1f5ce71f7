THE PARASUR\xc4\x80MA AVAT\xc4\x80RA.\n\nThe incarnation of Parasur\xc4\x81ma, or R\xc4\x81ma with axe, was undertaken by Vishnu for\nthe purpose of exterminating the Kshattriya, or Warrior caste, * which had\ntried to assert its authority over the Br\xc4\x81hmanical. Twenty-one times R\xc4\x81ma is\nsaid to have cleared the earth of these men, but by various means some few\nwere preserved alive who were able to perpetuate the race.\n\np. 163\n\n[paragraph continues] The story of this incarnation evidently points to a time\nwhen there was a severe and prolonged struggle for supremacy between the\nmembers of these two classes. Eventually success lay with the Br\xc4\x81hmans. It\nshould be noticed that the scene of Vishnu\'s exploits in this Avat\xc4\x81ra, and in\nthose which follow it, was the earth; and not, as in those preceding, the\nabode of the gods.\n\nThe following legend of the birth of Parasur\xc4\x81ma is from the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na." *\nA prince named Gadhi, who was himself an incarnation of Indra, had a daughter\nnamed Satyavati. Richika, a descendant of Bhrigu, \xe2\x80\xa0 demanded her in marriage.\nThe king asked from the decrepit old Br\xc4\x81hman a thousand fleet white horses,\neach having one black ear, as a wedding present. These horses were obtained,\nby the help of Varuna, and the Br\xc4\x81hman received the hand of the princess.\n\nIn order to effect the birth of a son, Richika prepared a dish of rice,\nbarley, and pulse, with butter and milk, for his wife to eat, and, at her\nrequest, consecrated a similar mixture for her mother, by partaking of which\nshe hoped to give birth to a prince of martial prowess, Leaving both dishes\nwith his wife, after carefully describing which was for herself and which for\nher mother, the sage went away into the forest. When the time for eating the\nfood came, the mother said to Satyavati, "Daughter! all mothers wish their\nchildren to be possessed of excellent qualities, and would be mortified to see\nthem surpassed by the merits of their brother. Give me, therefore, the mess\nyour husband has set apart for you, and you eat that which was intended for\nme. The son which it is intended to procure for me, is destined to be the\nmonarch of the whole world; whilst that which your dish will give you must be\na Br\xc4\x81hman,\n\np. 164\n\nalike devoid of affluence, valour, and power." Satyavati consented to this\nproposal, and they exchanged messes.\n\n[![THE PARASUR\xc4\x80MA AVAT\xc4\x80RA.](tn/16400.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/16400.jpg)  \nTHE PARASUR\xc4\x80MA AVAT\xc4\x80RA.  \n\nOn Richika\'s return, perceiving what had happened, he said to his wife,\n"Sinful woman! what hast thou\n\np. 165\n\ndone? I see thy body of a fearful appearance. Thou hast eaten of the\nconsecrated food that was prepared for thy mother; thou hast done wrong. In\nthat food I had infused the properties of power, and strength, and heroism; in\nthine, the qualities suited to a Br\xc4\x81hman--gentleness, knowledge, and\nresignation. In consequence of having reversed my plans, thy son shall follow\na warrior\'s propensities, and use weapons, and fight, and slay. Thy mother\'s\nson shall be born with the inclinations of a Br\xc4\x81hman, and be addicted to peace\nand piety." Satyavati, hearing this, fell at her husband\'s feet, and asked\nthat she might not have such a son as he had described; "but if such there\nmust be, let it be my grandson and not my son." The Muni relented, and said,\n"So be it." Accordingly in due time she gave birth to a son named Jamadagni,\nwho married Renuk\xc4\x81, and had by her the destroyer of the Kshattriya race,\nParasur\xc4\x81ma, who was a portion of N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81yana, the spiritual guide of the\nuniverse.\n\nThis is all we find about Parasur\xc4\x81ma\'s work in the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na." The story\nof his exploits is told at length twice over in the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata, and is found\nin the Bh\xc4\x81gavata, Padma, and Agni Pur\xc4\x81nas. The following account is from the\nMah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata. *\n\nJamadagni, the son of Richika (whose birth was just described), having married\nRenuk\xc4\x81, "conducted the princess to his hermitage, and she was contented to\npartake in his ascetic life. They had four sons, and then a fifth, who was\nJamadagnya (Parasur\xc4\x81ma), the last, but not the least, of the brethren. Once\nwhen her sons were absent gathering the fruits on which they fed, Renuk\xc4\x81, who\nwas exact in the discharge of all her duties, went forth to bathe. On her way\nto the stream\n\np. 166\n\nshe beheld Chitraratha, the Prince of Mrittik\xc4\x81vati, with a garland of lotuses\non his neck, sporting with his queen in the water, and she felt envious of\ntheir felicity. Defiled by unworthy thoughts, wetted, but not purified by the\nstream, she returned disquieted to the hermitage. Beholding her fallen from\nher perfection, and shorn of the lustre of her sanctity, Jamadagni reproved\nher, and was exceeding wroth.\n\n"Upon this, her sons came from the wood, and each as he entered was\nsuccessively commended by his father to put his mother to death; but, amazed\nand influenced by natural affection, neither of them made any reply; therefore\nJamadagni cursed them, and they became idiots. Lastly R\xc4\x81ma returned to the\nhermitage, when the mighty and holy Jamadagni said to him, \'Kill thy mother,\nwho has sinned; and do it without repining.\' R\xc4\x81ma accordingly took up his axe\n[this was the Parasu, or axe, which Siva had given him] and struck off his\nmother\'s head; whereupon the wrath of Jamadagni was assuaged, and, pleased\nwith his son, said: \'Since thou hast obeyed my commands, and done what was\nhard to be performed, demand from me whatever blessing thou wilt, and thy\ndesires shall be fulfilled.\' R\xc4\x81ma begged these boons: the restoration of his\nmother to life, with forgetfulness of having been slain, and purification from\nall defilement; the return of his brothers to their natural condition; and for\nhimself, invincibility in single combat, and length of days. All these his\nfather bestowed.\n\n"It happened on one occasion that, during the absence of the Rishi\'s sons, the\nmighty monarch K\xc4\x81rttavirya, the sovereign of the Haihaya tribe, endowed by the\nfavour of Dattatreya * with a thousand arms, and a\n\np. 167\n\ngolden chariot that went wheresoever he willed it to go, came to the hermitage\nof Jamadagni, where the wife of the sage received him with proper respect.\nThis K\xc4\x81rttavirya, by reason of his strength, had greatly oppressed the gods,\nRishis, and all creatures. The gods and Rishis applied to Vishnu, who, with\nIndra, devised the means of destroying him. The king, inflated with the pride\nof valour, made no return for the hospitality of the Rishi\'s wife; but carried\noff with him the calf of the milch cow of the sacred oblation, and cast down\nthe tall trees of the hermitage."\n\nIn the R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana is an account of the wonderful cow whose calf this king stole.\nWhen commanded by her owner, on the occasion of the visit of a king to the\nhermitage, to supply the varied wants of the great multitude which accompanied\nhim--\n\n"\'The cow from whom all plenty flows,  \n Obedient to her saintly lord,  \n Viands to suit each taste outpoured.  \n Honey she gave, and roasted grain,  \n Mead sweet with flowers, and sugar-cane.  \n Each beverage of flavour rare,  \n And food of every sort, were there:  \n Hills of hot rice, and sweetened cakes,  \n And curdled milk, and soup in lakes.  \n Vast beakers flowing to the brim  \n With sugared drink prepared for him;  \n And dainty sweetmeats, deftly made,  \n Before the hermit\'s guests were laid.\'\n\n"When R\xc4\x81ma returned, his father told him what had happened; and seeing the cow\nin distress, he was filled with wrath. Taking up his splendid bow, he assailed\nK\xc4\x81rttavirya, and overthrew him in battle. With sharp arrows R\xc4\x81ma cut off his\nthousand arms, and he perished. The sons of K\xc4\x81rttavirya, to avenge their\nfather\'s death,\n\np. 168\n\nattacked the hermitage of Jamadagni when R\xc4\x81ma was absent, and slew the pious\nand unresisting sage, who called repeatedly, but fruitlessly, upon his valiant\nson. R\xc4\x81ma deeply lamented his father\'s death, performed the last obsequies,\nand lighted the funeral pile. He then made a vow that he would extirpate the\nwhole Kshattriya race. In fulfilment of which, with remorseless and fatal\nrage, he destroyed the sons of K\xc4\x81rttavirya; and, after them, whatever\nKshattriyas he encountered. Thrice seven times * did he clear the earth of the\nKshattriya caste. After he had cleared the world of Kshattriyas, their widows\ncame to the Br\xc4\x81hmans, praying for offspring. The religious Br\xc4\x81hmans, free from\nany impulse of lust, cohabited with these women, who, in consequence, brought\nforth valiant Kshattriya boys and girls."\n\nIn another passage in the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata it is taught that it was in consequence\nof the curse of a sage named Apava, that R\xc4\x81ma was able to kill K\xc4\x81rttavirya.\nThe king had permitted Agni to devour the hermitage of this Rishi, who, in\nrevenge, declared that his thousand arms should be cut off by Parasur\xc4\x81ma.\n\nIn the R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana is an interesting legend in which Parasur\xc4\x81ma, himself an\nincarnation of Vishnu, is described as meeting with R\xc4\x81ma Chandra, the next\navat\xc4\x81ra of the same deity, and in which the superiority of R\xc4\x81ma Chandra is\ndeclared. \xe2\x80\xa0 "As King Dasaratha was returning to his capital with R\xc4\x81ma\n(Chandra), he was alarmed by the ill-omened sounds uttered by certain birds.\nThe\n\np. 169\n\nalarming event indicated was the arrival of Parasur\xc4\x81ma. He was fearful to\nbehold, brilliant as fire, and bore his axe and a bow on his shoulder. Being\nreceived with honour, he proceeded to say to R\xc4\x81ma, the son of Dasaratha, that\nhe had heard of his prowess in breaking the bow produced by Janaka, and had\nbrought another which he asked him to bend, and to fit an arrow on the string;\nand offered, if he succeeded in doing so, to engage with him in single combat.\nParasur\xc4\x81ma went on to say that the bow R\xc4\x81ma had broken was Siva\'s; but that\nthe one he now brought was Vishnu\'s. The gods, anxious to discover which was\nthe greater, Siva or Vishnu, and considering this a favourable opportunity for\ndoing so, sought Brahm\xc4\x81\'s help. He thereupon excited the passions of the two\nR\xc4\x81mas. A great fight ensued. Siva\'s bow of dreadful power was relaxed, and the\nthree-eyed Mah\xc4\x81deva was arrested by a muttering. The gods were satisfied, and\njudged Vishnu to be superior. Parasur\xc4\x81ma, however, did not agree to their\njudgment, so offered Vishnu\'s bow for his antagonist to try his strength on.\nThus challenged, R\xc4\x81ma snatches the bow, bends it, and fits an arrow to the\nstring; and then tells his challenger that as he is a Br\xc4\x81hman he will not slay\nhim, but will either take away his superhuman capacity of movement, or deprive\nhim of the blessed abodes he had gained by austerity. Parasur\xc4\x81ma entreats that\nhis power of movement may not be taken away, but consents that his blissful\nabodes may be destroyed. \'By bending this bow,\' he said, \'I recognize thee to\nbe the imperishable slayer of Madhu, the great lord.\' R\xc4\x81ma shoots the arrow,\nand destroys Parasur\xc4\x81ma\'s abodes."\n\nThe explanation of this strange legend seems to be the one that is commonly\nreceived by Oriental scholars, that the passages in the Epic poems which speak\nof R\xc4\x81ma as\n\np. 170\n\nan incarnation of Vishnu are interpolations of a later date than the original\npoem; and this interview of Parasur\xc4\x81ma with R\xc4\x81ma Chandra was introduced for\nthe purpose of giving a quasi-divine sanction to the teaching of these\ninterpolations. If Parasur\xc4\x81ma, an admitted incarnation of Vishnu, acknowledged\nthat R\xc4\x81ma was superior to himself, what stronger proof could be given that\nR\xc4\x81ma too was divine?\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[162:*](hmvp24.htm#fr_158) There are four chief castes or j\xc4\x81tis of Hindus: the\nBr\xc4\x81hman, or Priestly; the Kshattriya, or Warrior; the Vaisya, or Merchant; and\nthe Sudra, or Servant. These four classes are commonly said to have sprung\nrespectively from the head, arms, thighs, and feet of the Creator, though\nthere is good reason for the belief that in the olden time no such ideas of\nthe divine origin of caste prevailed. The four original castes have become\nsubdivided into an immense number. This subdivision has been brought about by\ninter-marriage with members of other classes.\n\n[163:*](hmvp24.htm#fr_159) Page 400.\n\n[163:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp24.htm#fr_160) See part iii. chap. i.\n\n[165:*](hmvp24.htm#fr_161) "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na," note p. 401; and Muir, O.

It was when his\nwork was effectually accomplished, and there was not a single Kshattriya man\nleft, that their widows resorted to the Br\xc4\x81hmans, as noticed above.\n\n[168:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp24.htm#fr_164) Muir, O.
