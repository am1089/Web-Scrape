A sire have we,  \nNo women uncontrolled and free.  \nGo, and our sire\'s consent obtain  \nIf thou our maiden hands wouldst gain.  \nNo self-dependent life we live:  \nIf we offend, our fault forgive.\'  \n\'But led by folly as a slave,  \nHe would not hear the rede we gave,  \nAnd even as we gently spoke  \nWe felt the Wind-God\'s crushing stroke.\'  \n\nThe pious king, with grief distressed,  \nThe noble hundred thus addressed:  \n\'With patience, daughters, bear your fate,  \nYours was a deed supremely great  \nWhen with one mind you kept from shame  \nThe honour of your father\'s name.  \nPatience, when men their anger vent,  \nIs woman\'s praise and ornament;  \nYet when the Gods inflict the blow  \nHard is it to support the woe.  \nPatience, my girls, exceeds all price:  \n\'Tis alms, and truth, and sacrifice.  \nPatience is virtue, patience fame:  \nPatience upholds this earthly frame.  \nAnd now, I think, is come the time  \nTo wed you in jour maiden prime.  \nNow, daughters, go where\'er you will:  \nThoughts for your good my mind shall fill.\'  \n\nThe maidens went, consoled, away:  \nThe best of kings, that very day,  \nSummoned his ministers of state  \nAbout their marriage to debate.  \nSince then, because the Wind-God bent  \nThe damsels\' forms for punishment,  \nThat royal town is known to fame  \nBy Kanyakubja\'s  1 borrowed name.  \n\nThere lived a sage called Chuli then,  \nDevoutest of the sons of men;  \nHis days in penance rites he spent,  \nA glorious saint, most continent.  \nTo him absorbed in tasks austere  \nThe child of Urmila drew near,  \nSweet Somada, the heavenly maid,  \nAnd lent the saint her pious aid.  \nLong time near him the maiden spent,  \nAnd served him meek and reverent,  \nTill the great hermit, pleased with her,  \nThus spoke unto his minister:  \n\'Grateful am I for all thy care:  \nBlest maiden, speak, thy wish declare.\'  \nThe sweet-voiced nymph rejoiced to see  \nThe favour of the devotee,  \nAnd to that eloquent old man,  \nMost eloquent she thus began:  \n\'Thou hast, by heavenly grace sustained,  \nClose union with the Godhead gained.  \nI long, O Saint, to see a son  \nBy force of holy penance won.  \nUnwed, a maiden life I live:  \nA son to me, thy suppliant, give.\'  \nThe saint with favour heard her prayer,  \nAnd gave a son exceeding fair.  \nHim, Chuli\'s spiritual child,  \nHis mother Brahmadatta  1b styled.  \nKing Brahmadatta, rich and great,  \nIn Kampili maintained his state,  \nRuling, like Indra in his bliss,  \nHis fortunate metropolis.  \nKing Kus\'anabha planned that he  \nHis hundred daughters\' lord should be.  \nTo him, obedient to his call,  \nThe happy monarch gave them all.  \nLike Indra then he took the hand  \nOf every maiden of the band.  \nSoon as the hand of each young maid  \nIn Brahmadatta\'s palm was laid,  \nDeformity and cares away,  \nShe shone in beauty bright and gay.  \nTheir freedom from the Wind-God\'s might  \nSaw Kus\'anabha with delight.  \nEach glance that on their forms he threw  \nFilled him with raptures ever new.  \nThen when the rites were all complete,  \nWitli highest marks of honour meet  \nThe bridegroom with his brides he sent  \nTo his great seat of government.  \n\nThe nymph received with pleasant speech  \nHer daughters; and, embracing each,  \nUpon their forms she fondly gazed,  \nAnd royal Kus\'anabha praised.  \n\np. 48  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[46:1](ry036.htm#fr_171) The modern Berar.\n\n[46:2](ry036.htm#fr_172) According to the Bengal recension the first\n(Kus\'amba) is called Kus\'as\'va, and his city Kaus\'as\'vi.
