The Purvapakshin holds that\nthese two meditations are different since the latter text mentions qualities--\nsuch as Brahman being the lord of all--which are not mentioned in the former;\nthe objects of meditation thus being different, the meditations themselves are\ndifferent.\n\np. 642\n\n[paragraph continues] \\--This the Sutra negatives. The object of meditation is\n'equal,' for both texts state the same qualities, such as 'consisting of\nmind,' and so on; and the additional qualities stated in the B _ri_ had-ara\n_n_ yaka, such as the rulership of Brahman,'do not differ' from those equally\nstated by both texts, such as Brahman realising all its purposes, and so on.\nThus the objects of meditation do not differ in character.--Here terminates\nthe adhikara _n_ a of 'what is equal.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 20.
