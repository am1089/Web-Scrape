Now, the gods did not know the Pavamana 2 at the A _s_ vamedha to\nbe the heavenly world, but the horse knew it. When, at the A _s_ vamedha,\n\np. 305\n\nthey glide along 1 with the horse for the Pavamana (-stotra), it is for\ngetting to know (the way to) the heavenly world; and they hold on to the\nhorse's tail, in order to reach the heavenly world; for man does not rightly\nknow (the way to) the heavenly world, but the horse does rightly know it\n\n13:2:3:22\\. Were the Udgat _ri_ to chant the Udgitha 2, it would be even as if\none who does not know the country were to lead by another (than the right)\nway. But if, setting aside the Udgat _ri_ , he chooses\n\np. 306\n\nthe horse for (performing) the Udgitha, it is just as when one who knows the\ncountry leads on the right way: the horse leads the Sacrificer rightly to the\nheavenly world. It makes 'Hi\xe1\xb9\x85 1,' and thereby makes the. Saman itself to be\n'hi\xe1\xb9\x85': this is the Udgitha. They pen up mares, (and on seeing the horse) they\nutter a shrill sound: as when the chanters sing, such like is this. The\npriests' fee is gold weighing a hundred (grains): the mystic import of this\nhas been explained 2.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[304:2](sbe44085.htm#fr_775) Pavamana is the name of the pressed Soma while it\nis 'clarifying.' Hence the first stotra of each of the three Savanas of a\nSoma-day--chanted after the pressing of the Soma and the drawing of the\nprincipal cups--is called Pavamana-stotra. Whether by the term 'Pavamana' here\nthe clarifying Soma is alluded to, as well as the stotra--which alone the\ncommentator takes it to mean, and to which the second mention certainly refers\n--must remain p. 305 doubtful. The commentator, it would seem, accounts for\nthis identification of the Pavamana-stotra with heaven by the fact that the\nsecond day of the A _s_ vamedha is an ekavi _m_ _s_ a day (see [XIII, 3, 3,\n3](sbe44096.htm#13:3:3:3); Ta _n_ _d_ ya-Br. XXI, 4, 1), i.e. one on which all\nthe stotras are performed in the twenty-one-versed hymn-form; and that the Sun\nis commonly called 'ekavi _m_ _s_ a,' the twenty-first, or twenty-one-fold.\nThe particular chant intended is that of the morning pressing, viz. the\nBahishpavamana, or outside-Pavamana-stotra, so-called because at the ordinary\none-day's Soma-sacrifice, it is chanted outside the Sadas. But, on the other\nhand, in the case of Ahina-sacrifices, or those lasting from two to twelve\ndays, that stotra is chanted outside only on the first day, whilst on the\nothers it is done inside the Sadas. An exception is, however, made in the case\nof the A _s_ vamedha, which requires the morning Pavamana, on all three days,\nto be performed in its usual place on the north-eastern part of Vedi, south of\nthe _K_ atvala.\n\n[305:1](sbe44085.htm#fr_776) For the noiseless way of sliding or creeping from\nthe Sadas, and returning thither, and approaching the different Dhish _n_ yas,\nor fire-hearths, see part ii, p. 299, note 2. As has already been stated, it\nis only after the chanting of the Bahishpavamana that the victims are driven\nup to the offering place.\n\n[305:2](sbe44085.htm#fr_777) It is from this, the principal part of the Saman,\nor chanted verse (cf. part ii, p. 310, note), that the Udgat _ri_ takes his\nname; this particular function of his being, on the present occasion, supposed\nto he performed by the whinnying of the horse. After this they make the horse\nstep on the chanting-ground, apparently either as a visible recognition of the\npart it has been made to play, or because the horse thereby is made to go to\nheaven with which the Bahishpavamana was identified.\n\n[306:1](sbe44085.htm#fr_778) On the mystic significance of this ejaculation\n(here compared with the neighing of the horse) in the sacrifice, and\nespecially in the Saman, see I, 4, 1, 1 seqq.; II, 2, 4, 12.\n\n[306:2](sbe44085.htm#fr_779) [XII, 7, 2, 13](sbe44066.htm#12:7:2:13).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 2, 4.
