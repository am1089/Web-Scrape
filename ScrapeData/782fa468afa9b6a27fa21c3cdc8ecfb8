Vyasa said :-- O King! When Vis\xc2\x92vamitra saw that the boy was crying very\npitifully, he went to him with a merciful heart and said :-- \xc2\x93O Child! I am\ngiving you the Varu _n_ a Mantra; recollect this within your mind and if you\ngo on repeating that Mantra silently, you will certainly fare well.\xc2\x94 The\nsorrowful S\xc2\x92unahs\xc2\x92epha, hearing thus from Vis\xc2\x92vamitra, began to repeat\nsilently in his mind the above Mantra, clearly pronouncing each letter. O\nKing! No sooner S\xc2\x92unahs\xc2\x92epha repeated that Mantra than the kind-hearted Varu\n_n_ a came suddenly before the boy, greatly pleased with him. Everyone in the\nassembly became thoroughly surprised to see Varu _n_ a Deva come there and\nthey all became glad and chanted hymns in honour of him. The diseased\nHaris\xc2\x92chandra was also thoroughly surprised, fell to his feet, and with folded\npalms began to sing hymns to Varu _n_ a, standing before him.\n\n\n\n7-14. Haris\xc2\x92chandra said :-- \xc2\x93O Deva of the Devas! I am very vicious; my\nintellect is much defiled; I am a sinner before you; O Merciful One! Now show\nyour mercy and sanctify this humble self. I was very much troubled on not\nhaving a son; so I had disregarded your words; now show your mercy on me; what\noffence can cling to him whose intellect is already out of order? A beggar\ndoes not see his own faults; I am also in want of a son; so I could not see my\ndefects. O Lord! Being afraid of the terrors of hell, I have deceived\n\n\n\np. 651\n\n\n\nyou. Those, who are sonless, cannot find rest anywhere. Especially he is\nbarred from the Heavens. Being terrified by this dictate of S\xc2\x92astra, I have\nshown disregard to your words. O Lord! You are wise and I am ignorant;\nespecially I am extremely afflicted by this terrible disease; I am also\ndeprived of my son; so you ought not to take any notice of my faults. O Lord!\nI do not know where my son has gone; O merciful One! Perhaps he, being afraid\nof his life, has fled away to some forest. For your satisfaction, I have now\ncommenced your sacrifice with this purchased boy; I gave an equivalent value\nand I have purchased this boy. O Deva of the Devas! Your sight only has taken\naway my infinite troubles; now if you be pleased, I can be free of my this\ndisease dropsy and my troubles will all be over.\xc2\x94 Vyasa said :-- O King!\nHearing thus the words of that diseased King, Varu _n_ a, the Deva of the\nDevas, took pity on him and thus spoke.\n\n\n\n15-22. Varu _n_ a said :-- \xc2\x93O King! S\xc2\x92unahs\xc2\x92epha is uttering hymns of praise\nto me; he has become very distressed; so quit him. Your sacrifice, too, is now\ncompleted; now let you be free from your present disease.\xc2\x94 Thus saying, Varu\n_n_ a freed the King of his disease in the presence of all his councillors;\nthe King became possessed of a beautiful body and got himself completely cured\nand shone bright before the assembly. Shouts of victory arose from the midst\nof the sacrificial ground when the Brahmi _n_ boy was freed of his bonds of\nrope, by the mercy of the high-souled Deva Varu _n_ a. The King became very\nglad on his being recovered immediately from his disease and S\xc2\x92unahs\xc2\x92epha,\ntoo, became free from his anxiety and pacified when he got himself liberated\nfrom his being immolated on the sacrificial post. Then the King Haris\xc2\x92chandra\ncompleted his sacrifice with great modesty. Afterwards S\xc2\x92unahs\xc2\x92epha addressed\nthe councillors with folded palms and said :-- O Councillors! You know well\nthe Dharma; O Speakers of truth! Kindly specify according to the dictates of\nthe Vedas. O Omniscient ones! Whose son am I now? Who is my most respectful\nfather? Please deliver your judgment and I will take his refuge.\n\n\n\n23-34. When S\xc2\x92unahs\xc2\x92epha spoke thus, the members of the assembly began to\nspeak to each other, \xc2\x93The boy must be of Ajigarta; whose else can he be? This\nboy is born of the limbs of Ajigarta; and he has nursed him according to his\nmight. So he must be his son; whose else can he be?\xc2\x94 Vama Deva then told the\npeople of the assembly, \xc2\x93The father of the boy sold his son for money; the\nKing purchased him. So he can be said as the son of the King; or he may be\ncalled the son of Varu _n_ a, in as much as he freed him from his rope\nbondage. For, he\n\n\n\np. 652\n\n\n\nwho nourishes another with food, who saves one from one\xc2\x92s fear, who protects\none by giving money, who bestows learning to anybody and he who gives birth to\nany of the above five classes of persons can be called his father.\xc2\x94 O King!\nThus some one turned out to be in favour of Ajigarta, some other in favour of\nthe King; but nobody came to any definite conclusion. When matters stood in\nthis doubtful condition, the omniscient all-respected Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha Deva\naddressed the disputing members thus :-- \xc2\x93O high-souled Ones! Kindly hear what\nthe S\xc2\x92rutis say on this point. When the father has cut off his filial\nattachment and has sold his son, his fatherly connection has ceased then. No\ndoubt this boy was purchased by the King Haris\xc2\x92chandra. But when the King\nfastened him to the sacrificial post, he cannot be called as the father. Again\nwhen this boy singing hymns in honour of Varu _n_ a, he being glad freed him\nof his bondage, so Varu _n_ a cannot be called his father. For whoever praises\na god by the great Mantra, that Deva becomes pleased with him and gives him\nwealth, life, cattle, kingdom and even final emancipation. Rather Vis\xc2\x92vamitra\nsaved the boy by giving him in his critical moment the powerful great Mantra\nof Varu _n_ a; hence the boy can be called as the son of Vis\xc2\x92vamitra and of\nnone else.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n35-40. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing the words of Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha, all the\nmembers of the assembly gave their unanimous consent and Vis\xc2\x92vamitra with his\nheart filled with love, exclaimed, \xc2\x93O Son! Come to my house.\xc2\x94 And caught hold\nof his right hand. S\xc2\x92unahs\xc2\x92epha, too, accompanied him and went away. Varu _n_\na also went to his own abode with a gladdened heart. The councillors, too,\ndeparted. Freed from his disease, the King gladly began to govern his\nsubjects. At this time his son Rohita heard all about Varu _n_ a and became\nvery glad and leaving the impassable forest passes and mountains, returned\nhome. The messengers informed the King of the arrival of the prince; the King\nheard and his heart overflowed with love and he gladly came there with no\ndelay.\n\n\n\n41-48. Seeing the father coming, Rohitas\xc2\x92va became filled with love and\noverpowered with sorrow for long separation began to shed tears and fell\nprostrate at his feet. The King raised him up and embraced him gladly and\nsmelling his head enquired of his welfare. When the King was thus asking his\nson, taking him on his lap, the hot tears of joy flowed from his eyes and fell\non the head of the prince. The King and the prince then began to govern\ntogether his kingdom. The King described in detail all the events of the\nsacrifice where human victims are immolated. He started next the Rajasuya\nsacrifice, the best of all sacrifices, and duly worshipping the Muni Vas\xc2\x92i\n_st_ ha, made him the\n\n\n\np. 653\n\n\n\nHota in that sacrifice. When this grand sacrifice was finished, the King\nrespected the Muni Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha with abundant wealth. Once, on a time, the\nMuni Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha went gladly to the romantic Heaven of Indra; and\nVis\xc2\x92vamitra, too, went there also and both the Munis then met with each other.\nThe two Mahar _s_ is took their seats in that Heaven. But Vis\xc2\x92vamitra was\nastonished to see Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha greatly respected in Indra\xc2\x92s hall of assembly\nand asked him, thus :--\n\n\n\n49\\. \xc2\x93O Muni! Where have you received this great honour and worship? O Highly\nFortunate One! Who has worshipped you thus? Speak out truly.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n50-53. Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha said :-- \xc2\x93O Muni! There is a King named Haris\xc2\x92chandra; he\nis very powerful and my client; that King performed the great Rajasuya\nsacrifice with abundant Dak _s_ i _n_ as. There is no other King truthful like\nhim; he is virtuous, charitable, and ever ready in governing his subjects. O\nSon of Kaus\xc2\x92ika! I have got my worship and honour in his sacrifice. O best of\nDvijas! Are you telling me to speak truly? Again I speak truly to you that\nthere never was a King truthful, heroic, charitable, and very religious like\nhim nor there will be such a one.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n54\\. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing such words, the Vis\xc2\x92vamitra, of a very\nangry temper, spoke to him with his reddened eyes :--\n\n\n\n55-59. \xc2\x93O Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha! Haris\xc2\x92chandra obtained a boon from Varu _n_ a when he\nmade a certain promise; then he cheated Varu _n_ a with deceitful words. So he\nis a liar and cheat. Why are you praising then that King? O Intelligent One!\nLet us now stake all our virtues that we have earned since our birth by our\nasceticism and studies. You have praised exceedingly that King who is a great\ncheat; but if I cannot prove him to be a liar of the first order, I will lose\nall my virtues from my birth; but if it be otherwise, then all your virtues\nwill be destroyed.\xc2\x94 Thus the two Munis quarrelled with each other and making\nthis stake, departed from the Heavens and went to their respective \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92ramas.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Seventeenth Chapter in the Seventh Book on the freeing of\nS\xc2\x92unahs\xc2\x92epha and the curing of Haris\xc2\x92chandra in the Mahapura _n_ am S'ri Mad\nDevi Bhagavatam, of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 18](bk07ch18.htm)\n\n"
