He quickeneth the waters\xc2\x92 seed.  \n21 This Agni is the Master of spoil thousandfold and  \nhundredfold, the sapient one, the head of wealth.  \n22 Agni, Atharvan brought thee forth by rubbing from the  \nlotus-leaf, the head of Visva, of the Priest.\n\np. 135\n\n23 Guide of the rite art thou and of the region to which with  \nthine auspicious teams thou tendest.  \nThy light-bestowing head to heaven thou liftest, making thy  \ntongue oblation-bearer, Agni.  \n24 Agni is wakened by the people's fuel to meet the Dawn who  \ncometh like a milch-cow.  \nLike young trees shooting up on high their branches his  \nflames are rising to the vault of heaven.  \n25 To him adorable, sage, strong and mighty we have sung  \nforth our song of praise and homage.  \nGavishthira hath raised with prayer to Agni this laud  \nfar-reaching as the gold in heaven.  \n26 Here by ordainers was this God appointed first Invoker, best  \nat worship, to be praised at rites;  \nWhom Apnavana and the Bhrigus caused to shine bright-coloured  \nin the wood, spreading to every house.  \n27 The watchful Guardian of the people hath been born, Agni  \nthe very strong, for fresh prosperity.  \nWith oil upon his face, with high heaven-touching flame, he  \nshineth splendidly, pure for the Bharatas.  \n28 Agni, Angirases discovered thee what time thou layest hidden,  \nfleeing back from wood to wood.  \nThou by attrition art produced as conquering, might, and  \nmen, O Angiras, call thee the Son of Strength.  \n29 Offer to Agni, O my friends, your seemly food, your seemly  \npraise;  \nTo him supremest o\xc2\x92er the folk, the Son of Strength, the  \nMighty Lord.  \n30 Thou, mighty Agni, gatherest up all that is precious for thy  \nfriend:  \nBring us all treasure as thou art enkindled in libation's place.\n\np. 136\n\n31 O Agni, loved of many, thou of fame most wondrous, in  \ntheir homes  \nMen call on thee whose hair is flame to be the bearer of  \ntheir gifts.  \n32 With this my reverent hymn I call Agni for you, the Son.  \nof Strength,  \nDear, wisest envoy, served with noble sacrifice, immortal  \nmessenger of all.  \n33 Immortal messenger of all, immortal messenger of all,  \nHis two red steeds, all-cherishing; he harnesseth: let him,  \nwell-worshipped, urge them fast.  \n34 Let him well-worshipped urge them fast, let him  \nwell-worshipped urge them fast.  \nThen hath the sacrifice good prayer and happy end, and  \nheavenly gift of wealth to men.  \n35 O Agni, thou who art the Lord of wealth in kine, the Son  \nof Strength,  \nVouchsafe to us, O Jatavedas, high renown.  \n36 He, Agni, kindled, good and wise, must be exalted in our  \nsong:  \nShine, thou of many forms, shine radiantly on us.  \n37 O Agni, shining of thyself by night and when the morning  \nbreaks,  \nBurn, thou whose teeth are sharp, against the Rakshasas.  \n38 May Agni, worshipped, bring us bliss, may the gift, Blessed  \nOne! and sacrifice bring bliss,  \nYea, may our praises bring us bliss.  \n39 Yea, may our praises bring us bliss. Show forth the mind  \nthat brings success in war with fiends, wherewith thou  \nconquerest in fights:  \n40 Wherewith thou conquerest in fights. Bring down the many  \nfirm hopes of our enemies, and let us vanquish with thine  \naid.\n\np. 137\n\n41 I value Agni, that good Lord, the home to which the kind  \nreturn;  \nWhom fleet-foot coursers seek as home, and strong enduring  \nsteeds as home. Bring food to those who sing thy praise.  \n42 \xc2\x92Tis Agni whom we laud as good, to whom the milch-kine  \ncome in herds,  \nTo whom the coursers swift of foot, to whom our well-born  \nprinces come. Bring food to those who sing thy praise.  \n43 Thou, brilliant God, within thy mouth warmest both ladles  \nof the oil.  \nSo fill us also in our hymns abundantly, O Lord of Strength.  \nBring food to those who sing thy praise.  \n44 Agni, with lauds this day may we bring thee that which  \nthou lovest,  \nRight judgment, like a horse, with our devotions.  \n45 For thou hast ever been the car-driver, Agni, of noble  \nStrength, lofty sacrifice, and rightful judgment.  \n46 Through these our praises come thou to meet us, bright as  \nthe sunlight,  \nO Agni, well-disposed, with all thine aspects.  \n47 Agni I hold as Herald, the munificent, the gracious Son of  \nStrength who knoweth all that live, as holy singer knowing  \nall;  \nLord of fair rites, a God with form erected, turning to the  \nGods,  \nHe, when the flame hath sprung forth from the sacred oil,  \nthe offered fatness, longeth for it with his glow.  \n48 O Agni, be our nearest Friend, be thou a kind deliverer and  \na gracious Friend.  \nCome as good Agni, come as excellent and give us wealth  \nmost splendidly renowned.  \nTo thee then, O most bright, O radiant God, we come with  \nprayer for happiness for our friends.\n\np. 138\n\n49 With what devotion, winning light, the Rishis came, kindling  \nAgni, to the Holy session,  \nEven with that in heaven I stablish Agni whom men call  \nhim whose sacred grass is scattered.  \n50 Gods, let us follow him with wives beside us, with sons, with  \nbrothers, with our gold adornments,  \nGrasping the sky up in the world of virtue, on the third  \nheight, the luminous realm of heaven.  \n51 This Agni mounted up to Speech's Centre, Lord of the  \nBrave, observant, ever-active.  \nLaid on the back of Earth, may he, resplendent, cast under  \nfoot those who would fight against us.  \n52 May this most manly Agni, strength-bestower, giver of thousands,  \nshine with care that fails not.  \nResplendent in the middle of the water, make thine approach  \nto the celestial mansions.  \n53 Make him go forth from all sides: meet, Approach ye. O  \nAgni, make the paths for Godward travel.  \nMaking the Parents young with life's renewal, the out spun  \nthread in thee have they extended.  \n54 Wake up, O Agni, thou, and keep him watchful. Wish and  \nfruition, meet, and he, together.  \nIn this and in the loftier habitation be seated, All-Gods!  \nand the Sacrificer.  \n55 Convey our sacrifice to heaven that it may reach the God  \nwith that\n\np. 139\n\nWhereby thou, Agni, bearest wealth in thousands and all  \nprecious things.  \n6 56 This is thine ordered place of birth whence sprung to life  \nthou shonest forth.  \nKnowing this, Agni, rise thou up and cause our riches to  \nincrease.  \n57 Tapa, Tapasya, pair of Dewy Seasons: thou art, etc. (as  \nin XIII. 25).  \n58 On the sky's back may Parameshthin lay thee, etc. (as in  \nXIV. 14).  \nThy Lord is Surya, etc. (as in XIV. 14).  \n59 Repeated from XII. 54.  \n60 Repeated from XII. 55.  \n61 Repeated from XII. 56.  \n62 Like a horse neighing, eager for the pasture, when he hath  \nstepped forth from the great enclosure:  \nThen the wind following blows upon his splendour, and,  \nstraight, the path is black which thou hast travelled.  \n63 In \xc3\x82yu's seat I set thee, in the shadow of the protector in  \nthe heart of Ocean,  \nThee luminous, bright with eyes, thee who illumest the sky,  \nthe earth, and air's broad realm between them.  \n64 On the sky's back may Parameshthin set thee, etc. (as in  \nXIV. 12, substituting sky for air and Surya for Vayu).  \n65 Thou art the measure of a thousand. Thou art the representative  \nof a thousand. Thou art the equivalent of a thousand. Thou art  \nworth a thousand. Thee for a thousand.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book XVI](wyvbk16.htm)\n\n"
