Vyasa said :-- O King! Seeing the two Danavas killed in the battle, the\nremnant soldiers all fled away back to S\xc2\x92umbha. Some of them were cut and\nwounded in many places by arrows, some had their arms severed, some were\nbleeding; thus they entered crying into the sky. On reaching the lord of the\nDaityas, they began to make frequently the noise indicative of danger and\nexclaimed, \xc2\x93O King! Save us, Save us; Kalika is devouring everything today.\nThe two great warriors Cha _nd_ a and Mu _nd_ a, the tormentors of the Devas,\nwere slain by Her; all the soldiers were devoured by Her; we have fled away\npanic-stricken. O Lord! Kalika has rendered the battlefield horrible by the\ndead bodies of elephants, horses, camels, warriors, and foot soldiers. A river\nof blood is flowing there of which the flesh of the soldiers is sufficient\nmud, their hairs are like aquatic plants, the broken chariot wheels are like\nwhirlpools, the severed arms and feet are like fishes and their heads look\nlike Tumbi fruits (long gourds). O King! Save your line; go quickly to Patala.\nThe Devi has become angry and will, no doubt, destroy our\n\n\n\np. 448\n\n\n\nrace. Even the lion is eating away the Danavas; and the Kalika Devi is killing\ninnumerable Danavas by Her arrows. Therefore, O King! What intentions are you\ncherishing in your mind? Is it that you have desired to be merely slain with\nyour younger brother Nis\xc2\x92umbha! And what good purpose will this cruel woman,\ndestroying your race, serve, for Whose sake, you have desired to kill all your\nfriends? O King! Victory or defeat in this world are under the Daiva. The wise\nnever risk to meet with great difficulties for the gratification of an\nordinary whim. O Lord! Look at the wonderful deeds of that Great Creator! What\nmore wonder can there be than this that a woman alone killed all the Danavas.\nO King! You have conquered by the help of your army all the Lokapalas\n(guardians of the quarters of the sky); but now that Lady, though alone and\nunsupported by anybody, is challenging you to fight.\n\n\n\n15-24. O King! In ancient times, in the holy pilgrimage of Pu _s_ kara, the\nsacred place of the Devas, you performed austerities when Brahma, the\nGrandsire of all the worlds, came to you to grant a boon. Then you asked the\nboon and wanted to become to be immortal. But when Brahma refused to grant it\nyou wanted from him and were granted that you would not be killed by any male\nbeing, be he a Deva, Danava, a man, Naga, Kinnara, Yak _s_ a, or any other\nperson. O Lord! For that very reason we think now that this Lady has timely\ncome to kill you. Think over it seriously and cease fighting. O King! This\nDevi is the great Maha-Maya, the Highest Prakriti; It is She that devours\neverything at the end of a Kalpa . This auspicious Devi is the Creatrix of all\nthe worlds and the Devas. She is the embodiment of the three qualities,\nendowed with all the powers. She is Tamasi, i.e., is the Destructrix of the\nwhole world. This Devi can never be conquered, Imperishable, Eternal, She is\nthe Sandhya and the Refuge of the Devas. She is Gayatri, the Mother of the\nVedas. She is All-knowing and always manifested. This Undecaying Lady is void\nof any Prakritic attributes, though She at times possesses attributes. She is\nSuccess Incarnate and bestows success to all; She is Bliss Herself and gives\nbliss to all. This Gauri bids all the Devas discard all their fears. She is\nS\xc2\x92uddha Sattva. Thus knowing, O King! Quit thy inimical feelings to Her; seek\nrefuge unto Her; the Devi would then certainly protect you. Be obedient to Her\nand save your race. Then the remnant Danavas will be able to live for a very\nlong time.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n25\\. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing thus, S\xc2\x92umbha, the conqueror of the Devas,\ntold them truly in words becoming of a hero.\n\n\n\n26-42. S\xc2\x92umbha said :-- \xc2\x93O Fools! Hold your tongue.You have fled because your\ndesire to live is very strong. So you better go to\n\n\n\np. 449\n\n\n\nPatala without any delay. This world is under the control of Fate; so I need\nnot think about Victory. I am under this Fate just as Brahma and other Devas\nare under it. Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, Rudra, Yama, Ag _n_ i, Varu _n_ a, Surya,\nChandra, and Indra are all under the sway of this Destiny. O Fools! Whatever\nis inevitable will certainly come to pass. What need I think over it then? The\neffort also comes to be of such a nature as will lead to that ordained by\nFate. Thus thinking, the wise never grieve; especially the wise ones never\nleave their own Dharma for fear of death. The happiness, pain, longevity,\nbirth and death of all the embodied souls are all determined by Fate when\ntheir proper time arrives. See! When the time is over, Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and\nMahadeva, the lord of Parvati die away; on the expiration of their terms of\nlives, Indra and other Devas go to destruction. Similarly I am also completely\nunder the sway of time; so what doubt is there that I, too, will go to\ndestruction when I have observed my own Dharma! This Lady is challenging me to\nfight of Her own will; how can I fly away and live hundreds of years. I will\nfight today. Let the result come whatever it may. I will gladly take the\nvictory or defeat whatever the case may be. The learned approving of the cause\nof effort declare Fate as fictitious; those who realise their sayings know\nthat they are full of reason. Without exertion no end can be achieved; weak\npersons depend on the destiny. Foolish persons say that Fate is strong; but\nthe wise do not say so. There is no proof whether Fate exists or not; in fact\nwhat is called Fate is invisible; how can it then be seen? Has anybody seen\nFate? It is simply a scare for the illiterate; remedy only to console one\xc2\x92s\nmind in times of distress. Simply proximity to a grindmill without any man\xc2\x92s\neffort cannot grind a material. Therefore if exertion be made in proportion to\nthe gravity of the work, success is sure to ensue; if exertion be made less in\nproportion, the work does not come to a successful issue. If time, place and\none\xc2\x92s enemies\xc2\x92 forces be correctly taken into account and then if the proper\nattempts be made, success follows; thus Brihaspati has said.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n43-44. Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus making a firm resolve to send the powerful\nRaktabija to the battle with a vast army; S\xc2\x92umbha said :-- \xc2\x93O Raktabija! You\nare a very powerful hero; therefore do you go to the battle. O Fortunate One!\nFight as you are the strength of your forces.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n45-46. Raktabija said :-- \xc2\x93O King! You need not be a bit anxious for this\nwork.Certainly I will either slay Her or I will bring Her under your control.\nPlease see my skill in this warfare; that Lady, favourite\n\n\n\np. 450\n\n\n\nof the gods, is worth nothing; I will just now conquer Her and make Her your\nslave.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n47-50. Vyasa said :-- O Best of Kurus! Thus saying, the powerful Raktabija\nmounted on his chariot and went to the battle accompanied by his forces. The\nbattalion consisted of cavalry, infantry, chariots and elephants. Thus\nsurrounded he departed from the city for that Devi, seated on a mountain top.\nThen the Devi, seeing him coming, blew Her conchshell; the Danavas were\nterrified at that sound and the joy of the Devas increased. Hearing that sound\nRaktabija came very hurriedly to Chamu _nd_ a and began to speak to Her\nsweetly.\n\n\n\n51-62. O Girl! Do you think me weak and thus want to terrify me with the sound\nof a conchshell? O Lean One! Have you taken me to be a Dhumralochana? O Sweet\nspeaking one! My name is Raktabija; I have come here for Thy sake. If Thou\ndesirest to fight, be prepared; I am not a bit afraid of that. O Dear! You saw\nthose who were weak; I do not belong to that class. Therefore dost Thou fight\nas Thou likest and then Thou wilt be able to ascertain my strength. O\nBeautiful! If Thou didst serve the old persons before, if Thou hadst heard the\nscience of politics and morals, if Thou hadst studied the political economy,\njoined the assemblage of the Pundits or if Thou hast been well versed in\nliterature and Tantras, then hear this my good counsel which will serve as a\nmedicinal diet to Thee. Out of the nine sentiments, the S\xc2\x92ringara (Amorous\nlove sentiments) and S\xc2\x92anti (Peace) are considered as the chief by the\nassemblage of the Pundits. Again out of these two, the love sentiment is the\nking. Drenched with this sentiment, Vi _sn_ u lives with Kamala; Brahma, the\nfour-faced, lives with Savitri; Indra with S\xc2\x92achi and S\xc2\x92ankara resides with\nhis wife Uma. The tree stands with creepers surrounding it, the deer lives\nwith his female deer, the pigeon lives with the female pigeon; thus all the\nbeings are very attached to this sentiment of remaining in couples. Those who\ncannot enjoy owing to certain disease or illness, they are deprived by Fate of\nsuch enjoyments. Those who are ignorant of this love sentiment in couples,\nthey are deprived of it by the sweet jugglery of words of the cheat and yet\nattached to the Peace sentiment. When delusion, the destroyer of Buddhi, the\ncommon sense, occurs, when the violent indomitable anger, greed, and lust\narise, where, then, is the place for knowledge and dispassion? Therefore, O\nAuspicious One! Dost Thou marry the beautiful S\xc2\x92umbha or the powerful\nNis\xc2\x92umbha.\n\n\n\n63\\. Vyasa said :-- O King! When Raktabija spoke all these words, standing\nbefore the Devi Kalika, Ambika and Chamu _nd_ a began to laugh.\n\n\n\np. 451\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-seventh Chapter of the Fifth Book on the description of\nthe war of Raktabija in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, the Maha Pura _n_ am, of\n18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 28](bk05ch28.htm)\n\n'
